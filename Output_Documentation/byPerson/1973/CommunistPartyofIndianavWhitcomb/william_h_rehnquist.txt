rehnquist
will
that
position
be
limited
to
federal
elections
if
you
are
talking
about
the
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
your
statement
was
that
is
insofar
as
the
state
can
move
in
the
area
of
federal
elections,
if
you
are
arguing
in
constitutional
grounds,
i
would
think
it
would
be
across
the
board.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
in
federal
elections
is
if
that's
limiting
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sendak,
what
is
it,
the
state's
position
as
you
represented
here,
with
respect
to
whether
the
indiana
election
commissioners
could
refuse
a
place
on
the
ballot
to
a
party
that
signed
the
oath
as
upheld
by
the
district
court
just
because
the
election
commissioners
felt
that
perhaps
the
oath
was
not
truthful?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rosen
on
the
abstention
point
theory
because
i
am
a
circuit
justice
for
the
seventh
circuit,
i
remember
a
little
about
this
case
last
fall
and
it
kind
of
came
up
very
rapidly
as
i
recall
and
so
that
the
abstention
probably
was
at
least
thought
to
be
practical
at
the
time.
you
needed
a
decision
rather
and
elect
--
the
election
board
needed
some
of
the
advice
for
it?
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
justice
stewart
inquired
whether
anyone
had
suggested
abstention
in
the
case,
then
the
district
court
abstaining
to
get
a
binding
construction
of
the
statute
from
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
my
recollection
is
that
this
was
all
pretty
much
a
day-to-day
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
in
the
board
too?
