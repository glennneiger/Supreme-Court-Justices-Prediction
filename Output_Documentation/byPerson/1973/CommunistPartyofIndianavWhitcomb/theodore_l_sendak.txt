mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
company
may
your
honor,
or
the
chief
counsel
of
my
office
mr.
shaldon
bresko(ph),
assistant
attorney
general
darrel
k.
diamond
and
one
of
the
name
defendants
mr.
karl
steifer(ph)of
indianapolis
was
the
member
of
the
bar
at
this
court
as
well.
the
matter
of
jurisdictional
question
which
the
court
has
is
reserved,
we
too
passed
to
our
brief
on
pages
five
and
six
and
would
differ
on
that
and
prefer
to
argue
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
state
of
indiana
as
represented
by
its
indiana
general
assembly
and
as
upheld
by
the
indiana
supreme
court
decided
long
ago
that
in
conformance
with
the
cases
of
this
court
that
the
state
has
a
right
of
self
reservation
and
that
in
balancing
the
rights
of
all
of
the
amendments
of
the
constitutions
that
this
court
has
never
held
at
the
first
amendment
right
are
absolute
or
that
any
rights
are
absolute,
that
there
has
to
be
a
balancing
of
the
rights
and
the
history
of
indiana
would
show
that
we
have
had
difficulties
and
as
the
reading
of
our
oath
would
imply,
our
oath
as
it
has
been
trimmed
down
by
the
federal
court
below
and
which
we
defend
is
to
the
effect
that
the
political
parties
or
political
groups
seeking
the
official
status
of
political
parties
must
have
their
officers
sign
this
oath
and
submit
it
along
with
their
petitions
to
the
state
elections
board.
now
our
law
applies
to
all
political
parties
unlike
the
ohio
law
and
gilligan
which
this
court
ruled
upon
last
year.
our
law
applies
to
republicans,
democrats
and
every
other
party
before
they
get
on
initially
and
then
each
year
but
there
is
an
election
they
are
required
by
the
same
law
to
submit
a
statement
in
that
platform
officially
staying
the
substance
of
this
same
oath
and
all
parties
which
get
on
the
ballot,
including
the
socialist
labor
party
and
socialist
workers
party
and
the
others,
the
peace
and
the
freedom
party
in
1972
so
complied.
but
all
that
we
ask
now
is
that
these
party
official
state
that
they
do
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
local,
state
or
national
government
by
force
or
violence
and
besides
the
history
of
the
thing
which
would
show
you
some
background
in
indiana's
consideration
here,
we
have
the
feeling,
as
expressed
so
well,
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
cole
v.
richardson
case
that
seems,
there
is
no
constitutionally
protected
right
to
overthrow
our
government
by
force,
violence
or
illegal
or
unconstitutional
means,
no
constitutional
right
is
infringed
by
an
oath
to
abide
by
the
constitutional
system
in
the
future.
our
feeling
is
that
once
you
pass
the
threshold
of
moving
from
the
college
or
the
coffee
klatch
or
the
power
discussion
into
the
status
of
an
official
political
party
where
you
are
recognized
by
the
state
and
start
off
with
an
equal
opportunity,
no
matter
what
the
odds
are,
taken
over
the
reigns
of
government
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
ask
you
to
abide
by
the
rules.
once
you
cross
that
threshold.you
move
from
potential
to
kinetic
in
terms
of
the
battle
for
political
power
and
the
indiana
law
is
clear,
it
is
continuing,
it
applies
to
all
political
parties,
reasonable
men
can
understand
it.
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
attached.
appellants'
counsel
refers
to
an
official
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
to
the
election
board.
official
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
in
indiana
are
not
the
official
construction
of
the
law.
the
construction
of
the
law
in
indiana
is
by
the
indiana
supreme
court.
all
official
opinions
in
indiana
are
merely
advisory.
the
attorney
general
of
indiana
has
to
general
criminal
powers.
all
he
is
doing
in
that
opinion
was
stating
a
fact,
upon
reading
the
communist
platform
as
circulated
in
indiana
and
reading
the
fact
that
they
failed
to
take
the
oath,
he
was
stating
the
fact,
that
of
they
did
take
fields
as
they
state
in
here,
that
they
might
not
be
telling
the
truth,
they
might
be
semantics
to
disguise
their
actual
advocacy
of
action.
if
i
may
refer
to
page
32
a
of
the
appendix
prepared
by
appellants
in
which
they
state,
in
their
petition
of
october
3,
submitted
to
the
court
below,
“in
order
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
state
election
board,
the
court
and
the
citizens
of
indiana,
that
said
party,
the
communist
party,
was
not
conjuring
itself.”
the
last
sentences
said,
affidavits
was
attached
and
that
last
sentence
was
that
qualification
with
reference
to
a
statement
taken
out
of
context
in
yates
and
then
the
statement
in
that
same
paragraph,
thus
the
plaintiff
communist
party
can
with
the
clear
conscious
signed,
attached
affidavit.
in
other
words,
they
reserved
the
right,
they
impliedly
admit
that
they
do
advocate
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government,
but
they
reserve
the
right
to
specify
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
method.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
the
state's
position
is
being
changed
by
the
district
court
below
and
our
failure
to
get
jurisdiction
for
docketed
here
on
the
other
issue,
but
a
basic
law
in
indiana
is
that
the
state
election
board
must
strictly
comply
with
that
requirement.
that
is
if
a
rule
presents
a
petition
and
with
the
requisite
number
of
signed
registered
voters
and
presents
the
affidavit,
the
state
election
board
must
receive
it.
the
law
also
states,
that
the
state
election
board
shall
then,
make
an
investigation
after
the
accuracy
of
the
petitions
which
it
had
no
opportunity
to
do
here,
because
of
the
time
element
and
as
to
abreast
of
the
affidavit.
it
provides
no
criminal
penalties,
however,
and
the
only
action
it
can
take
at
that
point,
if
it
finds
either
the
affidavit
is
wrong,
as
it
did
in
another
case
and
did
in
this
case
or
that
the
petitions
are
insufficient,
it
just
rejects
the
party's
position
on
the
ballot.
in
1968,
the
same
issue
came
up
before
the
indiana
supreme
court,
socialist
labor
party
versus
state
election
board.
they
submitted
the
required
number
of
affidavits
or
petitions,
excuse
me,
but
their
affidavit
was
incorrect.
it
did
not
strictly
follow
the
law,
so
they
were
thrown
off
the
ballot
and
the
indiana
supreme
court
said
that
the
state
election
board
has
a
duty
of
strict
compliance
with
the
law.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
the
election
board
being
obligated
to
comply
strictly
would
have
to
put
them
on
a
ballot.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes,
your
honor.
now
this
law
was
passed
in
1945
at
the
height
of
world
war
ii
and
referring
again
the
indiana's
experience
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir,
but
they
had
to
submit
this
affidavit
in
1945
to
be
on
the
ballot
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
no
party
did
before.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
but
it
applies
to
all
equally
and
it
is
a
continuing
requirement
now.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
indiana?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
sir?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
believe
the
communist
party
started
in
indiana
long
before
that,
long
around
1919
and
1920.
we
had
a
case
upon
which
we
rely
for
the
state's
construction,
for
example,
the
word
'advocacy'
and
that
was
the
bootash
(ph)
case
in
1937,
a
criminal
syndicalism
case
but
in
which
the
supreme
court
reversed
on
the
facts,
but
the
defined
advocacy
in
indiana
to
mean
incitement
to
action.
so
apparently
they
were
involved
in
activities
prior
to
1945.
the
1945
law
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
not
as
a
political
party,
no
sir.
they
never
been
on
the
ballot.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
state's
interests,
the
bullock
case
to
which
counsel
for
appellants
refer,
makes
the
statement
of
the
state
has
in
interest,
if
not
a
duty
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
political
processes
from
frivolous
or
fraudulent
candidacies.
this
court
has
upheld,
a
loyalty
oath
in
pennsylvania
for
political
candidates
in
lisker
in
1971,
where
the
loyalty
oath
was
much
more
loosely
worded,
it's
something
to
the
--
read
something
to
the
affect
that
the
potential
candidate
was
not
a
subversive
person,
whatever
that
would
be
and
then
again
in
the
gerende
case
in
1951
where
it
upheld
the
oath
in
maryland
for
political
candidates,
where
they
stated
they
were
not
engaged
in
one
way
or
another
in
activities
of
this
nature.
the
healy
case
in
1971
involving
the
sts,
this
court
made
a
statement,
a
holding,
i
believe
that
recognition
may
be
denied
to
any
group
which
reserves
the
right
to
violate
any
valid
rule
with
which
it
disagrees
and
that
is
our
contention
here,
that
by
they
do
it
yourself
oath
or
customize
oath,
appellants
presented
through
the
federal
court
below,
which
rejected
it,
by
the
way,
that
they
are
attempting
to
reserve
the
right
to
engage
in
this
action
and
therefore,
their
oath
is
not
valid,
they
are
performing,
and
if
at
all,
with
a
mental
reservation.
as
to
the
question
that
the
oath
must
exactly
pair-up
the
oath
that
the
president
of
united
states
takes,
discarded
as
many
times
how
if
that
is
not
so.
in
the
olsen
case,
in
1971,
i
believe
it
was,
1970,
this
court
has
held
specifically,
those
were
almost
the
exact
words
that
the
oath
administered
do
not
have
to
pair
to
the
oath
of
the
president.
as
to
the
use
of
the
words,
the
converse
elements,
i
like
the
wording
and
since
it
seems
to
be
a
bad
oath
semantics
in
sense
of
the
word,
in
cole
versus
richardson,
which
i
just
quoted.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well,
in
this
court
it
is.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
believe
the
cole
versus
richardson
explanation
goes
even
beyond
ours.
ours
just
says
that
we
will
not
take
those
actions,
we
will
not
advocate
action
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well
i
would
assume
so,
but
the
state
legislature
has
passed
act
here
and
it
simply
said
that
i
do
not
advocate
the
overthrow
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
sir?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
the
state
election
board
would
have
no
choice,
it
has
to
follow.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
but
i
thought
perhaps
mr.
justice
like
many
of
the
state
legislator
of
indiana
where
we
have
such
an
oath
it
would
be
fine.
it
would
encompass
the
same
thing.
the
--
in
cole
versus
richardson
the
words
to
oppose
the
overthrow
in
my
opinion
are
not
different
from
not
to
advocate
the
overthrow,
substantially
the
same
and
i
am
thinking
does
one
have
the
right
to
advocate
that
which
he
has
a
constitutional
duty
to
oppose.
in
the
very
fourteenth
amendment
i
would
like
to
refer
you
to
the
section
3
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
i
rarely
discussed
where
a
discretionary
oath
really
takes
place,
where
it
says
using
the
negative
to
begin
with,
“no
person
shall
be
an
elector
or
other
official
or
hold
any
public
office,
i
put
the
word
public
in
there,
any
office
who
haven't
previously
taken
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
shall
have
engaged
in
insurrection
or
rebellion
against
the
same
or
given
aid
or
comfort
to
the
enemies
thereof.
there
must
have
been
the
same
discussion
at
that
time
for
the
obvious
reasons
and
this
would
go
back
to
the
background
as
to
why
indiana
perhaps
adopted
this
oath
when
it
did
in
view
of
the
background.
the
case
of
ex
parte
milligan
with
which
this
court
is
well
squinted
besides
the
ruling
on
habeas
corpus,
the
factual
background
was
that
mr.
milligan
was
one
of
those
who
engaged
with
southern
sympathizers
in
overthrowing
several
local
units
of
government
and
when
general
morgan's
raiders
and
others
came
in
they
actually
took
over
for
a
period
of
days
local
units
of
government.
we
had
the
same
thing
in
indiana's
background
in
the
sense
during
the
1920s
and
30s
with
the
rise
of
the
ku
klux
klan
and
we
also
had
during
the
1930s
and
up
to
world
war
ii
very
radical
areas
as
between
the
german
american
bund
and
the
communist
party
in
indiana
and
these
things
caused
the
legislature
--
legislature
of
indiana
during
the
height
of
the
war
to
pass
this
law
and
to
apply
for
all
political
parties.
that's
a
legislative
background
on
that
law.
as
to
counsel
for
opponents
reference
to
brandenburg,
yates,
noto
and
those
cases,
they
are
criminal
cases
and
heavy
much
more
strict
standard
of
proof
in
the
civil
matter
such
as
this.
if
we
had
to
set
up
our
standard
we
would
say
that
in
indiana
following
the
construction
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
that
the
advocacy
has
to
be
linked
to
action
and
that
you
cannot
reserve
the
right
to
take
violent
action
if
you
are
going
across
the
threshold
and
become
officially
recognized
as
a
political
party.
the
one
other
thing
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
like
to
refer
to
is
the
very
platform
of
the
communist
party
itself
which
is
copyright
in
may
1970,
library
of
congress
no.
79-127023
and
circulated
throughout
the
country,
including
indiana
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier
a
voter
in
the
state
of
indiana
who
is
properly
registered
could
vote
in
1972
by
an
examination
of
these
platforms
for
everything
for
which
the
communist
party
stood
except
one,
he
could
not
vote
in
indiana
for
those
candidates
who
advocate
or
refuse
to
say
they
don't
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
but
the
communist
party
goes
on
to
say,
if
i
may
quote
very
briefly
in
point,
that
their
campaign
for
their
rights
free
from
all
social
and
legal
restrictions,
page
61,
page
64,
“we
communists
are
not
pacific.
we
leave
violence
from
the
class
standpoint.
accordingly
we
regard
non-violence
as
a
tactic
of
struggle
in
some
instances
but
we
do
not
adhere
to
it
as
a
principle
or
a
philosophy”
and
then
on
page
93,
“speaking
about
whether
or
not
there
would
have
to
be
a
bloody
ordeal
or
whether
they
could
assume
power
through
the
electoral
process
without
it.
yes
of
course
we
must
be
prepared
to
meet
any
eventuality
while
we
seek
a
peaceful
path
as
preferable
to
a
violent
one,
this
choice
may
prove
to
be
blocked
by
manipulatory
action,
socialism
must
be
sought
therefore
by
whatever
means
the
circumstances
may
impose”
and
then
finally
in
the
words
that
they
italicize
are
the
words
i
will
emphasize,
“the
very
development
of
present
day
struggles
lays
the
basis
for
making
clear
now
the
need
to
change
the
system
and
for
building
now
the
movement
for
socialism
in
united
states.
he
who
does
not
work
for
these
goals
now
will
never
be
prepared
for
revolutionary
change.”
so
they
are
advocating
action
now
which
may
prompt
it
to
take
some
unlawful
action
as
noted
in
yates
page
322,
quoting
dennis.
i
mentioned
the
cases
interpreting
our
law
in
indiana.
indiana
law
is
fair.
it
does
not
violate
anyone's
rights
with
respect
to
getting
on
the
ballot
if
they
will
make
a
conscientious
oath
and
effort
and
not
reserve
the
right
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
its
dictionary
sense
or
our
sense?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
this
statute
as
construed
by
the
indiana
supreme
court,
it
means
promoting
the
taking
of
illegal
action
either
now
or
something
in
the
future.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
that
strict
sense.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
taking
active
steps
to
incite,
the
word
incitement
would
be
more
appropriate
perhaps.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
sir?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
no,
but
this
is
the
construction
put
on
your
honor
by
the
indiana
supreme
court.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
anybody
is
free
to
say
that
in
indiana
or
anywhere
else.
it's
when
you
become
an
official
party
of
the
electoral
system
that
you
have
to
take
an
oath
that
you
are
not
going
to
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
don't
that
think
so.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well
anything
is
possibility
sir
in
these
days.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
you
are
right
sir.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well
to
me
it
means
as
the
three
young
persons
took
the
oath
here
that
they
would
support
the
constitution.
i
interpret
the
fact
that
these
three
young
people
before
this
law
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
that
sense
of
the
word,
but
advocacy
in
the
sense
the
word
as
contemplated
by
this
statute
and
has
construed
by
the
indiana
supreme
court
means
promoting
the
incitement.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
a
sense
he
is
yes.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
depends
on
the
context,
what
are
in
the
context
of
combat
arena
of
politics
and
struggle
for
the
reigns
of
the
government.
it
has
a
one
meaning
in
quite
surrounding
of
the
school,
it
has
another
meaning
here
and
is
less
than
opposed.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir,
this
court
considered
one
in
ohio
in
a
gilligan
case
last
year
and
their
case
as
much
i
don't
want
to
depreciate
theirs,
but
ours
is
much
more
strict.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well,
they
may
have
changed
it
legislatively
but
at
the
time
this
case
came
up
in
1972
it
had.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
think
other
states
do,
i
have
not
researched
all
that
--
so
i
can't
honestly
answer
that.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
company
may
your
honor,
or
the
chief
counsel
of
my
office
mr.
shaldon
bresko(ph),
assistant
attorney
general
darrel
k.
diamond
and
one
of
the
name
defendants
mr.
karl
steifer(ph)of
indianapolis
was
the
member
of
the
bar
at
this
court
as
well.
the
matter
of
jurisdictional
question
which
the
court
has
is
reserved,
we
too
passed
to
our
brief
on
pages
five
and
six
and
would
differ
on
that
and
prefer
to
argue
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
state
of
indiana
as
represented
by
its
indiana
general
assembly
and
as
upheld
by
the
indiana
supreme
court
decided
long
ago
that
in
conformance
with
the
cases
of
this
court
that
the
state
has
a
right
of
self
reservation
and
that
in
balancing
the
rights
of
all
of
the
amendments
of
the
constitutions
that
this
court
has
never
held
at
the
first
amendment
right
are
absolute
or
that
any
rights
are
absolute,
that
there
has
to
be
a
balancing
of
the
rights
and
the
history
of
indiana
would
show
that
we
have
had
difficulties
and
as
the
reading
of
our
oath
would
imply,
our
oath
as
it
has
been
trimmed
down
by
the
federal
court
below
and
which
we
defend
is
to
the
effect
that
the
political
parties
or
political
groups
seeking
the
official
status
of
political
parties
must
have
their
officers
sign
this
oath
and
submit
it
along
with
their
petitions
to
the
state
elections
board.
now
our
law
applies
to
all
political
parties
unlike
the
ohio
law
and
gilligan
which
this
court
ruled
upon
last
year.
our
law
applies
to
republicans,
democrats
and
every
other
party
before
they
get
on
initially
and
then
each
year
but
there
is
an
election
they
are
required
by
the
same
law
to
submit
a
statement
in
that
platform
officially
staying
the
substance
of
this
same
oath
and
all
parties
which
get
on
the
ballot,
including
the
socialist
labor
party
and
socialist
workers
party
and
the
others,
the
peace
and
the
freedom
party
in
1972
so
complied.
but
all
that
we
ask
now
is
that
these
party
official
state
that
they
do
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
local,
state
or
national
government
by
force
or
violence
and
besides
the
history
of
the
thing
which
would
show
you
some
background
in
indiana's
consideration
here,
we
have
the
feeling,
as
expressed
so
well,
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
cole
v.
richardson
case
that
seems,
there
is
no
constitutionally
protected
right
to
overthrow
our
government
by
force,
violence
or
illegal
or
unconstitutional
means,
no
constitutional
right
is
infringed
by
an
oath
to
abide
by
the
constitutional
system
in
the
future.
our
feeling
is
that
once
you
pass
the
threshold
of
moving
from
the
college
or
the
coffee
klatch
or
the
power
discussion
into
the
status
of
an
official
political
party
where
you
are
recognized
by
the
state
and
start
off
with
an
equal
opportunity,
no
matter
what
the
odds
are,
taken
over
the
reigns
of
government
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
ask
you
to
abide
by
the
rules.
once
you
cross
that
threshold.you
move
from
potential
to
kinetic
in
terms
of
the
battle
for
political
power
and
the
indiana
law
is
clear,
it
is
continuing,
it
applies
to
all
political
parties,
reasonable
men
can
understand
it.
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
attached.
appellants'
counsel
refers
to
an
official
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
to
the
election
board.
official
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
in
indiana
are
not
the
official
construction
of
the
law.
the
construction
of
the
law
in
indiana
is
by
the
indiana
supreme
court.
all
official
opinions
in
indiana
are
merely
advisory.
the
attorney
general
of
indiana
has
to
general
criminal
powers.
all
he
is
doing
in
that
opinion
was
stating
a
fact,
upon
reading
the
communist
platform
as
circulated
in
indiana
and
reading
the
fact
that
they
failed
to
take
the
oath,
he
was
stating
the
fact,
that
of
they
did
take
fields
as
they
state
in
here,
that
they
might
not
be
telling
the
truth,
they
might
be
semantics
to
disguise
their
actual
advocacy
of
action.
if
i
may
refer
to
page
32
a
of
the
appendix
prepared
by
appellants
in
which
they
state,
in
their
petition
of
october
3,
submitted
to
the
court
below,
“in
order
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
state
election
board,
the
court
and
the
citizens
of
indiana,
that
said
party,
the
communist
party,
was
not
conjuring
itself.”
the
last
sentences
said,
affidavits
was
attached
and
that
last
sentence
was
that
qualification
with
reference
to
a
statement
taken
out
of
context
in
yates
and
then
the
statement
in
that
same
paragraph,
thus
the
plaintiff
communist
party
can
with
the
clear
conscious
signed,
attached
affidavit.
in
other
words,
they
reserved
the
right,
they
impliedly
admit
that
they
do
advocate
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government,
but
they
reserve
the
right
to
specify
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
method.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
the
state's
position
is
being
changed
by
the
district
court
below
and
our
failure
to
get
jurisdiction
for
docketed
here
on
the
other
issue,
but
a
basic
law
in
indiana
is
that
the
state
election
board
must
strictly
comply
with
that
requirement.
that
is
if
a
rule
presents
a
petition
and
with
the
requisite
number
of
signed
registered
voters
and
presents
the
affidavit,
the
state
election
board
must
receive
it.
the
law
also
states,
that
the
state
election
board
shall
then,
make
an
investigation
after
the
accuracy
of
the
petitions
which
it
had
no
opportunity
to
do
here,
because
of
the
time
element
and
as
to
abreast
of
the
affidavit.
it
provides
no
criminal
penalties,
however,
and
the
only
action
it
can
take
at
that
point,
if
it
finds
either
the
affidavit
is
wrong,
as
it
did
in
another
case
and
did
in
this
case
or
that
the
petitions
are
insufficient,
it
just
rejects
the
party's
position
on
the
ballot.
in
1968,
the
same
issue
came
up
before
the
indiana
supreme
court,
socialist
labor
party
versus
state
election
board.
they
submitted
the
required
number
of
affidavits
or
petitions,
excuse
me,
but
their
affidavit
was
incorrect.
it
did
not
strictly
follow
the
law,
so
they
were
thrown
off
the
ballot
and
the
indiana
supreme
court
said
that
the
state
election
board
has
a
duty
of
strict
compliance
with
the
law.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
the
election
board
being
obligated
to
comply
strictly
would
have
to
put
them
on
a
ballot.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes,
your
honor.
now
this
law
was
passed
in
1945
at
the
height
of
world
war
ii
and
referring
again
the
indiana's
experience
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir,
but
they
had
to
submit
this
affidavit
in
1945
to
be
on
the
ballot
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
no
party
did
before.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
but
it
applies
to
all
equally
and
it
is
a
continuing
requirement
now.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
indiana?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
sir?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
believe
the
communist
party
started
in
indiana
long
before
that,
long
around
1919
and
1920.
we
had
a
case
upon
which
we
rely
for
the
state's
construction,
for
example,
the
word
'advocacy'
and
that
was
the
bootash
(ph)
case
in
1937,
a
criminal
syndicalism
case
but
in
which
the
supreme
court
reversed
on
the
facts,
but
the
defined
advocacy
in
indiana
to
mean
incitement
to
action.
so
apparently
they
were
involved
in
activities
prior
to
1945.
the
1945
law
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
not
as
a
political
party,
no
sir.
they
never
been
on
the
ballot.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
state's
interests,
the
bullock
case
to
which
counsel
for
appellants
refer,
makes
the
statement
of
the
state
has
in
interest,
if
not
a
duty
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
political
processes
from
frivolous
or
fraudulent
candidacies.
this
court
has
upheld,
a
loyalty
oath
in
pennsylvania
for
political
candidates
in
lisker
in
1971,
where
the
loyalty
oath
was
much
more
loosely
worded,
it's
something
to
the
--
read
something
to
the
affect
that
the
potential
candidate
was
not
a
subversive
person,
whatever
that
would
be
and
then
again
in
the
gerende
case
in
1951
where
it
upheld
the
oath
in
maryland
for
political
candidates,
where
they
stated
they
were
not
engaged
in
one
way
or
another
in
activities
of
this
nature.
the
healy
case
in
1971
involving
the
sts,
this
court
made
a
statement,
a
holding,
i
believe
that
recognition
may
be
denied
to
any
group
which
reserves
the
right
to
violate
any
valid
rule
with
which
it
disagrees
and
that
is
our
contention
here,
that
by
they
do
it
yourself
oath
or
customize
oath,
appellants
presented
through
the
federal
court
below,
which
rejected
it,
by
the
way,
that
they
are
attempting
to
reserve
the
right
to
engage
in
this
action
and
therefore,
their
oath
is
not
valid,
they
are
performing,
and
if
at
all,
with
a
mental
reservation.
as
to
the
question
that
the
oath
must
exactly
pair-up
the
oath
that
the
president
of
united
states
takes,
discarded
as
many
times
how
if
that
is
not
so.
in
the
olsen
case,
in
1971,
i
believe
it
was,
1970,
this
court
has
held
specifically,
those
were
almost
the
exact
words
that
the
oath
administered
do
not
have
to
pair
to
the
oath
of
the
president.
as
to
the
use
of
the
words,
the
converse
elements,
i
like
the
wording
and
since
it
seems
to
be
a
bad
oath
semantics
in
sense
of
the
word,
in
cole
versus
richardson,
which
i
just
quoted.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well,
in
this
court
it
is.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
believe
the
cole
versus
richardson
explanation
goes
even
beyond
ours.
ours
just
says
that
we
will
not
take
those
actions,
we
will
not
advocate
action
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well
i
would
assume
so,
but
the
state
legislature
has
passed
act
here
and
it
simply
said
that
i
do
not
advocate
the
overthrow
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
sir?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
the
state
election
board
would
have
no
choice,
it
has
to
follow.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
but
i
thought
perhaps
mr.
justice
like
many
of
the
state
legislator
of
indiana
where
we
have
such
an
oath
it
would
be
fine.
it
would
encompass
the
same
thing.
the
--
in
cole
versus
richardson
the
words
to
oppose
the
overthrow
in
my
opinion
are
not
different
from
not
to
advocate
the
overthrow,
substantially
the
same
and
i
am
thinking
does
one
have
the
right
to
advocate
that
which
he
has
a
constitutional
duty
to
oppose.
in
the
very
fourteenth
amendment
i
would
like
to
refer
you
to
the
section
3
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
i
rarely
discussed
where
a
discretionary
oath
really
takes
place,
where
it
says
using
the
negative
to
begin
with,
“no
person
shall
be
an
elector
or
other
official
or
hold
any
public
office,
i
put
the
word
public
in
there,
any
office
who
haven't
previously
taken
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
shall
have
engaged
in
insurrection
or
rebellion
against
the
same
or
given
aid
or
comfort
to
the
enemies
thereof.
there
must
have
been
the
same
discussion
at
that
time
for
the
obvious
reasons
and
this
would
go
back
to
the
background
as
to
why
indiana
perhaps
adopted
this
oath
when
it
did
in
view
of
the
background.
the
case
of
ex
parte
milligan
with
which
this
court
is
well
squinted
besides
the
ruling
on
habeas
corpus,
the
factual
background
was
that
mr.
milligan
was
one
of
those
who
engaged
with
southern
sympathizers
in
overthrowing
several
local
units
of
government
and
when
general
morgan's
raiders
and
others
came
in
they
actually
took
over
for
a
period
of
days
local
units
of
government.
we
had
the
same
thing
in
indiana's
background
in
the
sense
during
the
1920s
and
30s
with
the
rise
of
the
ku
klux
klan
and
we
also
had
during
the
1930s
and
up
to
world
war
ii
very
radical
areas
as
between
the
german
american
bund
and
the
communist
party
in
indiana
and
these
things
caused
the
legislature
--
legislature
of
indiana
during
the
height
of
the
war
to
pass
this
law
and
to
apply
for
all
political
parties.
that's
a
legislative
background
on
that
law.
as
to
counsel
for
opponents
reference
to
brandenburg,
yates,
noto
and
those
cases,
they
are
criminal
cases
and
heavy
much
more
strict
standard
of
proof
in
the
civil
matter
such
as
this.
if
we
had
to
set
up
our
standard
we
would
say
that
in
indiana
following
the
construction
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
that
the
advocacy
has
to
be
linked
to
action
and
that
you
cannot
reserve
the
right
to
take
violent
action
if
you
are
going
across
the
threshold
and
become
officially
recognized
as
a
political
party.
the
one
other
thing
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
like
to
refer
to
is
the
very
platform
of
the
communist
party
itself
which
is
copyright
in
may
1970,
library
of
congress
no.
79-127023
and
circulated
throughout
the
country,
including
indiana
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier
a
voter
in
the
state
of
indiana
who
is
properly
registered
could
vote
in
1972
by
an
examination
of
these
platforms
for
everything
for
which
the
communist
party
stood
except
one,
he
could
not
vote
in
indiana
for
those
candidates
who
advocate
or
refuse
to
say
they
don't
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
but
the
communist
party
goes
on
to
say,
if
i
may
quote
very
briefly
in
point,
that
their
campaign
for
their
rights
free
from
all
social
and
legal
restrictions,
page
61,
page
64,
“we
communists
are
not
pacific.
we
leave
violence
from
the
class
standpoint.
accordingly
we
regard
non-violence
as
a
tactic
of
struggle
in
some
instances
but
we
do
not
adhere
to
it
as
a
principle
or
a
philosophy”
and
then
on
page
93,
“speaking
about
whether
or
not
there
would
have
to
be
a
bloody
ordeal
or
whether
they
could
assume
power
through
the
electoral
process
without
it.
yes
of
course
we
must
be
prepared
to
meet
any
eventuality
while
we
seek
a
peaceful
path
as
preferable
to
a
violent
one,
this
choice
may
prove
to
be
blocked
by
manipulatory
action,
socialism
must
be
sought
therefore
by
whatever
means
the
circumstances
may
impose”
and
then
finally
in
the
words
that
they
italicize
are
the
words
i
will
emphasize,
“the
very
development
of
present
day
struggles
lays
the
basis
for
making
clear
now
the
need
to
change
the
system
and
for
building
now
the
movement
for
socialism
in
united
states.
he
who
does
not
work
for
these
goals
now
will
never
be
prepared
for
revolutionary
change.”
so
they
are
advocating
action
now
which
may
prompt
it
to
take
some
unlawful
action
as
noted
in
yates
page
322,
quoting
dennis.
i
mentioned
the
cases
interpreting
our
law
in
indiana.
indiana
law
is
fair.
it
does
not
violate
anyone's
rights
with
respect
to
getting
on
the
ballot
if
they
will
make
a
conscientious
oath
and
effort
and
not
reserve
the
right
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
its
dictionary
sense
or
our
sense?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
this
statute
as
construed
by
the
indiana
supreme
court,
it
means
promoting
the
taking
of
illegal
action
either
now
or
something
in
the
future.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
that
strict
sense.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
taking
active
steps
to
incite,
the
word
incitement
would
be
more
appropriate
perhaps.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
sir?
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
no,
but
this
is
the
construction
put
on
your
honor
by
the
indiana
supreme
court.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
anybody
is
free
to
say
that
in
indiana
or
anywhere
else.
it's
when
you
become
an
official
party
of
the
electoral
system
that
you
have
to
take
an
oath
that
you
are
not
going
to
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
don't
that
think
so.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well
anything
is
possibility
sir
in
these
days.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
you
are
right
sir.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well
to
me
it
means
as
the
three
young
persons
took
the
oath
here
that
they
would
support
the
constitution.
i
interpret
the
fact
that
these
three
young
people
before
this
law
--
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
that
sense
of
the
word,
but
advocacy
in
the
sense
the
word
as
contemplated
by
this
statute
and
has
construed
by
the
indiana
supreme
court
means
promoting
the
incitement.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
in
a
sense
he
is
yes.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
depends
on
the
context,
what
are
in
the
context
of
combat
arena
of
politics
and
struggle
for
the
reigns
of
the
government.
it
has
a
one
meaning
in
quite
surrounding
of
the
school,
it
has
another
meaning
here
and
is
less
than
opposed.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
yes
sir,
this
court
considered
one
in
ohio
in
a
gilligan
case
last
year
and
their
case
as
much
i
don't
want
to
depreciate
theirs,
but
ours
is
much
more
strict.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
well,
they
may
have
changed
it
legislatively
but
at
the
time
this
case
came
up
in
1972
it
had.
mr.
theodore
l.
sendak
i
think
other
states
do,
i
have
not
researched
all
that
--
so
i
can't
honestly
answer
that.
thank
you
very
much.
