mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
brings
before
the
court
a
challenge
to
a
provision
of
the
indiana
election
law
that
contained
conditions
political
party
access
to
the
ballot
on
the
making
on
a
disclaimer
that
the
party
does
not
advocate
overthrow
of
government
by
force
or
violence.
plaintiff’s
tendered
signatures
on
petitions
for
inclusion
on
the
ballot,
on
august
31st,
1972.
the
defendants,
the
election
board
of
indiana
rejected
the
petitions
the
same
day,
relying
on
the
provision
of
indiana
law
and
an
opinion
rendered
on
august
28
by
the
indiana
attorney
general.
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
affidavit
must
state
the
party
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
local
state
or
national
government
by
force
or
violence
and
that
it
is
not
affiliated
with
and
does
not
cooperate
with
nor
has
any
relation
with
any
foreign
government
or
political
party
or
group
of
individuals
of
any
foreign
government.
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
took
the
statute
a
step
or
so
further
stating
as
to
the
particular
appellants,
the
party
appellants,
the
communist
party
of
indiana
that
“this
communist
party
would
not
be
eligible
to
appear
on
the
indiana
ballot
even
if
its
officers
should
sign
an
affidavit
because
that
would
be
an
obvious
perjury
in
view
of
the
communist
party
stated
purposes
and
those
indiana
officials
who
would
be
responsible
for
placing
the
communist
party
on
the
ballot
could
be
subject
to
federal
criminal
prosecution,
as
well
under
the
smith
act
and
the
communist
control
act,
somewhat
(inaudible).”
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action,
the
communist
party
of
indiana,
the
candidates
for
the
presidency
and
vice
presidency
under
that
banner,
candidates
for
electors
of
the
president
and
the
vice
president
under
that
banner,
a
voter
and
the
class
of
voter
she
would
represent
sued
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
this
indiana
statute.
the
amended
complaint
which
is
the
basic
document
before
the
court
was
filed
on
september
8th,
1972.
a
hearing
was
held
on
september
28th,
1972
and
a
decision
was
conducted
on
the
same
day.
three-judge
district
court
in
indiana
ruled
that
the
affiliation
clause
of
the
statute,
the
statute
prohibiting
affiliation
with
a
foreign
government
or
a
segment
thereof,
was
on
constitution
on
its
face.
it
on
the
other
hand
specifically
validated
the
advocacy
clause.
the
communist
party
as
a
consequence
of
this
action
and
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
it
had
very
limited
time
in
which
to
get
on
the
ballot,
or
to
take
steps
to
get
on
the
ballot
for
the
1972
election,
submitted
a
qualified
affidavit,
pursuing
to
the
order
of
the
court.
in
that
affidavit
the
party
stated
by
its
officers
that
it
did
not
engage
in
the
unlawful
advocacy
or
the
prescribed
advocacy.
it
went
on
to
state
concerned
obviously
with
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
about
the
perjury
sanctions
that
the
term
advocate
used
here
in
has
the
meaning
given
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
yates,
“the
advocacy
and
teaching
of
concrete
action
for
the
forcible
overthrow
of
government
and
not
of
principles
divorced
from
actions.”
so
affidavit
was
tendered
and
rejected
by
the
election
board
on
september
29th
by
a
vote
of
2:1.
thereafter
the
plaintiffs
went
back
to
the
district
court,
requested
an
order
enforcing
the
previous
mandate
of
the
court,
that
order
was
denied
on
october
4th.
a
motion
to
amend
subsequently
made
was
denied
on
october
31st
and
various
attempts
by
the
appellants
here
and
appellees
on
the
other
side
were
also
rejected
in
an
emergency
posture
by
this
court.
both
sides
then
took
appeals
from
the
two
different
decisions
of
the
three
judge
court.
on
march
19,
1973,
this
court
summarily
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
three
judge
district
court
to
the
extent
that
that
court
had
invalidated
the
affiliation
clause
of
the
indiana
statute.
the
same
time,
the
instant
case,
the
appeal
by
the
communist
party,
its
candidates
and
voters,
the
court
entered
an
order
stating
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
has
been
postponed
to
the
hearing
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
now
what
appellants
take
to
be
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
at
this
point,
after
all
the
emergency
appeals
had
been
rendered
and
after
the
various
actions
have
been
taken
in
the
district
court
is
the
question
of
the
timeliness
of
the
appeal
and
i
would
like
to
rest,
so
far
as
that
question
is
concerned
on
the
brief.
we
brief
that
extensively,
possibly
too
extensively
but
since
the
question
was
reserved
and
this
was
the
question
that
appeared
to
us
to
be
the
jurisdictional
question,
we
had
briefed
that
from
pages
13
to
15
in
the
appellant's
brief
and
unless
the
court
desire
specific
argument
on
that
issue,
i
would
rest
on
the
brief
and
turn
to
the
merits.
plaintiff’s
request
to
this
court
to
reverse
and
remand
through
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
void
the
advocacy
provision
of
the
indiana
statute.
we
have
a
number
of
arguments
which
i
think
we
have
fairly
extensively
briefed
but
it
might
be
helpful
to
go
over
them
in
order.
our
first
point
concerns
the
nature
of
voting
a
standing
for
public
office
and
of
political
parties.
these
are
clearly
fundamental
interests,
enumerable
decisions
of
this
court
have
stated
that
the
right
to
vote
is
the
fountainhead
of
democratic
rights
in
our
society.
in
the
bullock
and
carter
decision
the
court
indicated
that
the
rights
of
the
candidacy
are
so
bound
up
with
the
right
to
vote
that
they
are
basically
inseparable,
and
of
course
in
williams
and
rhodes,
and
other
decisions
the
court
has
indicated
its
extreme
sensitivity
to
the
need
of
the
candidates
and
voters
to
be
affiliated
with
the
political
parties
that
are
able
to
place
on
the
ballot
of
a
state
or
of
a
national
election.
candidates
who
are
sponsored
and
clearly
stated
to
be
sponsored
by
given
political
parties.
to
this
extent
then,
this
case
involves
what
the
court
has
characterized
as
fundamental
interests
and
it
renders
this
case,
this
appeal
different
from
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
evaluated
oaths
in
other
contexts.
this
is
different
from
an
employment
oath
context,
it
is
different
from
a
bar
admission
context.
in
neither
of
those
other
context,
you
have
the
interest
that
is
being
withheld
as
a
result
of
the
oath,
achieve
the
kind
of
fundamental
interest
that
this
court
has
this
fine
voting
and
candidacy
and
political
association.
the
interest
itself,
the
vote,
the
candidacy.
in
those
cases
you
have
had
a
situation
in
which
an
interest
admittedly
a
valuable
interest,
has
been
conditioned
upon
the
giving
of
an
oath
or
an
affidavit,
and
evaluating
the
oath
or
affidavit,
the
court
has
been
looking
however,
so
far
as
the
constitutional
dimension
is
concerned
only
at
the
oath
or
the
affidavit
itself.
here
you
have
to
look
at
both,
both
have
first
amendment
dimensions,
the
vote,
the
candidacy
and
all,
and
also
the
affidavit,
involves
a
first
amendment
dimension.
now
we
submit
with
this
context
set
of
the
primacy
of
voting
that
the
state
has
an
enormous
burden
of
the
persuasion
of
the
necessity,
for
any
limitation
upon
voting
or
candidacy
particularly
a
limitation
that
may
encroach
itself
upon
first
amendment
rights,
by
enquiring
into
political
motivation
or
ideology
of
a
candidate
or
a
party.
the
state
has
no
such
legitimate,
nor
even
nor
certainly
compelling
interest
in
so
conditioning
voting
and
candidacy.
state
on
one
or
another
has
spoken
a
fraud
and
spurious
candidacies,
well
it
is
a
little
late
in
the
day
for
anybody
to
be
suggesting
that
the
efforts
of
the
communist
party
of
indiana
or
of
the
united
states
to
place
candidates
before
the
electorate
are
fraudulent
or
spurious.
it
is
a
political
party,
it
has
been
a
political
party
in
this
country
for
enumerable
years,
and
it
has
fielded
candidates
for
ohio
office
throughout
most
of
the
years
that
it
has
been
a
party
in
this
country.
subversion,
the
state
points
to
or
the
avoidance
of
subversion
as
being
a
legitimate
and
compelling
interest.
indeed
that
is
a
legitimate
interest.
obviously
the
state
has
an
interest
in
avoiding
its
subversion.
so
does
the
national
government.
well
it
is
a
compelling
interest
in
this
context
is
much
more
open
to
doubt,
we
think
actually
it
is
not
open
to
doubt,
it
is
not
a
compelling
interest.
the
state
is
asking
an
oath
three
steps
away
from
office
taking
itself.
to
get
on
the
ballot,
you
have
to
execute
the
oath,
to
get
to
the
point
where
you
can
subvert
the
government
from
within,
if
that
is
the
state’s
interest
in,
and
i
can't
conceive
of
another
interest
that
the
state
might
have
and
categorize
it
as
legitimate.
to
get
to
the
point
of
subverting
the
government,
you
got
to
win
the
election,
and
then
the
government
by
the
constitution,
article
6
and
article
2,
can
certainly
give
the
support
oath
and
screen
out
people
who
can
not
take
the
support
oath
before
office
taking
occurs.
so
this
oath
is
placed
in
to
steps
before
office
taking,
it
is
quite
an
enormous
offense,
the
state
is
placing
around
its
interest
in
avoiding
subversion.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
as
i
understand
it
to
mean
the
state
has
to
come
forward
with
an
interest
that--
i
don’t
want
to
use
the
term
outbalances,
well
i
think
the
court's
analysis
in
the
robel
case
of
how
legislation
is
to
evaluated
in
terms
of
compelling
interest
is
perhaps
is
the
most
apt,
as
i
recall
it
was
in
a
footnote,
in
the
robel
case
that
the
court
discussed
the
fact
that
it
wasn’t
talking
about
balancing
as
such,
it
recognized
on
the
one
hand
that
freedom
of
speech
is
an
important
interest
to
our
society
and
our
government.
on
the
other
hand
avoidance
of
subversion
in
sabotage
is
an
important
interest
as
well.
when
these
two
come
at
one
another,
seem
to
be
in
conflict
then
the
court
must
fall
back
to
a
somewhat
different
analysis
and
not
try
to
balance
one
against
the
other
necessarily
but
to
try
to
evaluate
whether
the
state
has
or
the
government
has
some
alternative
ways
of
securing
the
legitimate
interest
which
is
compelling
and
in
that
case
as
you
recall
justice
stewart,
the
court
ruled
that
the
federal
government
didn’t
demonstrated
lacked
alternative
ways
and
in
this
case
too.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
alright,
constitutionally
i
think
it
first
means
that
a
burden
of
proof
is
shifted,
a
burden
of
constitutional
proof,
whereas
initially
one
who
comes
in
to
challenge
a
state
law,
has
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
state
law
is
bad,
wholly
on
his
or
her
shoulders,
when
you
establish
a
fundamental
interest
or
if
you
are
dealing
with
the
equal
protect
clause
of
course
of
suspect
classification,
then
the
burden
of
proof
shifts.
first
the
burden
of
going
forward,
if
you
want
to
talk
in
evidentiary
terms
shifts
to
the
government
to
come
up
with
some
legitimate
reasons,
some
reasons
that
go
beyond
mere
rationality
which
would
be
the
ordinary
standard
to
be
applied
in
the
equal
protection
or
the
due
process
area.
now
having
come
up
with
these
legitimate
reasons
when
the
court
states
that
these
reasons
not
only
are
to
be
legitimate
but
also
must
be
compelling,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
is
either
talking
about
a
balancing
test
which
some
members
of
the
court
don’t
view
with
favor
or
it
is
talking
about
police
restrictive
alternative
test
and
in
either
event
it
still
and
also
pertains
i
think
to
a
burden
of
proof.
it
has
now
become
the
burden
of
proof
question
rather
the
burden
of
going
forward
question.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
i
think
so
i
think
robel
indicates
that
it
has
some
relevance
outside
of
that
area,
i
know
that
it
first
originated
in
the
equal
protection
clause
but
as
it
seems
to
me
in
the
later
decisions
of
the
court
to
be
something
of
a
spillover
into
a
first
amendment
area
because
of
the
parallelity
in
the
two
tests--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
certainly.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
would
certainly
argue
that
your
honor
but
the
state
i
am
sure
would
come
back
and
try
to
fantasize
circumstances
in
which
a
law
could
be
justifies
even--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
precisely.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
i
would
not
want
to
try
to
meet
the
hypotheticals
at
this
point
that
the
state
might
attempt
to
articulate,
but
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
stewart
that
if
it
is
an
invasion
of
the
first
amendment--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
however
once
you
move
to
through
the
opinions
of
this
court,
we
are
caught
up
with
sometimes
analysis
that
talks
about
compelling
interest
and
sometimes
analysis
that
talks
about
least
restrictive
alternative.
i
think
in
large
part
on
the
basis
of
a
legitimate
desire
and
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
avoid
facing
the
pure
first
amendment
question
unless
it
has
to,
so
the
court
presumably
would
decide
the
case
on
overbreath
and
vagueness
grounds.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
secondary
argument
that
we
would
agree
with
your
initial
agreement
that
is
if
this
is
an
invasion
of
the
first
amendment
and
over
breath--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
excuse
me
a
question
that
would
be
the
end
of
it,
if
the
court
is
compelled
then
by
its
own
decisions
or
by
its
own
analysis
of
the
issues
to
look
beyond
that
into
something
like
a
compelling
state
interest
or
compelling
governmental
analysis
interest
notion
or
a
least
restrictive
alternative
notion
then
we
would
suggest
the
state
can
not
meet
the
burden
of
proof
of
constitutional
proof
that
would
lodged
on
its
shoulders.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
might
be
shorthand
for
another
kind
of
decision.
i
think
that
from
time
to
time
in
the
opinions
of
the
court
there
is
discussion
of
the
compellingness
or
the
legitimacy
of
the
government’s
interest
in
taking
one
course
of
the
action
or
another.
even
in
some
of
the
decisions
that
involve
overbreath,
i
can't
put
my
fingers
on
them,
i
recently
read
the
broderick
decision
and
i
have
some
vague
recollection,
of
course
that
is
from
last
term
that
they
may
have
been
intimation
of
that
if
not
an
explication
of
it.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
first
amendment
also
it
is
protected
by
our
federalism
to
use
justice
black's
phrase,
it
is
protected
by
article
one
and
article
two.
so
far
as
the--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
the
right
to
vote,
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
this
case
for
the
moment
only
involves
federal
elections,
the
presidents
and
vice
presidents,
the
electors
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
we
were
that
it
is
a
federally
guaranteed
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
it
is
guaranteed
of
course
by
merely
the
statutes
but
we
think
it
is
also
guaranteed
by
articles
one,
two
and
the
various
amendments
to
the
constitution
bearing
upon
voting.
we
think
that---
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
right
of
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
we
think
there
is
the
first
amendment
right
to
vote
which
is
intimated
well.
it
is
not
intimated
in
bond
v.
floyd,
but
something
like
it
is
intimated
in
bond
v.
floyd
that
correlative
right
of
the
candidate
to
take
his
office.
we
think
in
powell
versus
mccormack,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
about
the
interest
of
the
polity
and
being
represented
by
people
they
chose.
i
cannot
say
to
the
court
that
there
was
an
explicit
ruling
of
the
court
that
states
in
so
many
words
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
or
otherwise
guaranteed
federal
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections
i
think
that
is
the
thrust
of
many
of
decisions
of
the
court.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
but
there
has
been
a
lot
of
constitution
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
doubt
that
it
has
been
overruled
and
as
i
say
i
do
not
think
there
has
been
an
explicit
statement
to
that
is
a
federally
protected
right
to
vote.
i
think
there
is
an
intimation
in
many
decision.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh
one
of
our
claims
of
course
is
taking
up
from
justice
stewart's
question
is
that,
there
is
a
first
amendment
dimension
to
the
right
to
vote
and
candidacy.
the
court
certainly
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
alright
in
various
ways
first
how
does
the
advocacy
provision
interfere?
well
first
in
the
very
pragmatic
way
it
interferes
because
the
communist
party
was
precluded
from
the
ballot.
it
attempted
to
articulate
an
advocacy
affidavit
which
was
consistent
with
decisions
of
this
court
namely
the
yates
case
which
was
then
rejected
by
the
defendants
and
appellee.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
is
it
why
is
it
that
it
cannot,
it
does
not
believe
that
it
should.
it
believes
that
it
is
protected
in
its
right
not
to
have
to
make
that
kind
of
mistake
in
order
to
gain
access
to
the
ballot
because
for
several
reasons.
the
oath
that
it
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
government
by
forcing
violence
without
any
further
qualification
goes
well
beyond
all
of
the
oaths
that
this
court
has
hereto
for
validated.
in
any
other
context,
leave
aside
now
the
fact
that
we
think
the
voting
in
candidacy
is
special
context.
this
is
not
the
function
equivalent
to
support
oath
and
in
recent
years
of
these,
the
only
kind
of
oath
that
this
court
has
ballotated
has
been
validated
only
on
the
basis
that
it
is
either
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
support
oath
or
it
is
invoked
strictly
speaking
to
determine
whether
the
person
making
the
oath
is
doing
it
conscientiously
in
terms
of
the
purposes
behind
the
support
oath.
that's
wadman
case
and
the
cole
versus
richardson's
case.
without
any
further
the
qualification,
the
absentee
clause
just
encroaches
well
beyond
a
person's
duty
as
a
citizen
to
stand
up
and
say
that
it
was
supported
to
offend
the
constitution.
it
says
it
requires
them
to
say
i
do
not
advocate
overthrow
by
force
or
violence.
that
language
is
very
very
dangerous
language.
it
is
a
dangerous
language
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
line
of
cases
running
from
dennis
through
yates
through
noto
and
scales
and
robel
brandenburg
because
there
is
a
lot
of
advocacy
of
forcing
violence
that
is
constitutionally
protected.
so
long
as
that
advocacy
is
not
directed
to
inciting
action.
now
we
think
immediate
action,
but
they
did
not
even
get
close
to
that
in
this
case.
so
as
long
as
the
advocacy
is
not
directed
to
the
incitement
of
action.
it
is
constitutionally
protected
in
and
of
itself.
now
we
have
a
number
of
other
arguments
which
go
back
to
the
basic
nature
of
our
federal
system.
we
submit
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
does
it
advocate?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
ask
the
party
or
any
of
its
agents.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
it
advocates
forcing
violence.
i
have
no
idea,
i
do
not
have
that,
the
issue
never
came
up
in
the
proceedings
and
i
do
not
think
it
was
my
obligation
to
ask.
in
the
particular
context
but
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
is
impossible
to
answer
your
honor,
i
would
not
want
to
have
to
answer
that
personally
in
some
circumstances.
so
the
point
being
that
it
is
too
abstract
and
open
ended
question.
alright,
but
we
do
have
certain
other
positions
and
that
is
that
so
far
as
candidacy
in
federal
elections
is
concerned,
so
far
as
that
kind
of
candidacy
is
concerned
the
state
is
limited
to
know
more
than
the
constitutional
oath
of
office
and
as
we
have
already
argued,
this
goes
well
beyond
the
constitutional
support
oath.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
will
it
be
limited?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
do
argue
across
the
board
your
honor
but
in
this
case
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
say
in
federal
elections
only
because
so
last
the
facts
are
involved
a
federal
election
in
this
particular
case
otherwise,
i
assure
you
your
honor,
i
would
be
here
arguing
that
it
cuts
across
the
board
and
we
have
intimated
such
an
argument
in
our
brief.
we
would
invite
the
court
to
go
that
far.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
am
familiar
with
it
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
would
rest
on
that
statement
your
honor
thank
you.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
beyond
the
office
taking.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
just
makes
it
much
more
attenuated
in
terms
of
any
interest
the
government
might
assert.
if
this
were
the
oath
that
the
state
of
indiana
required
of
its
office
takers
we
would
be
here
challenging
it
on
grounds
of
overbreadth.
it
is
not
the
functional
equivalent
that
we
support
of,
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
other
states
that
may
have
similar
statutes,
i
think
is
as
compendium
note
in
emerson,
haber
&
dorsen
at
pages
315
on
the
choice
to
collect
states,
but
that's
out
of
date.
i
understand
a
new
editions
is
coming
out,
there
have
been
states
that
have
similar
oaths.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
i
believe
so.
they
--
they
either
--
candidates
oath
or
party
oaths,
they
tendered
to
merge
them
together
that
would
be
as
many
as
20
who
have
one
kind
of
an
oath
or
another.
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
rebuttal
is,
of
course,
i
think
that
quoting
from
the
1950
communist
party
platform
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
issues
in
this
case
on
innumerable
grounds
that’s
part
of
the
record
in
the
case,
if
it
were,
it
would
be
stale
on
basis
of
many
decisions
to
this
court
involving
communist
party
registration
or
prosecution
so
that
it
is
obviously
a
sport.
on
over
breadth,
in
addition
to
the
cases
already
cited
to
the
court,
so
far
as
the
indiana
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
this
or
similar
statutes
is
concerned,
there
is
one
case
that
had
not
been
cited
so
far
that
state
versus
levitt,
203
ne
2nd
821
(1965)
in
which
the
indiana
supreme
court
impliedly
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
a
broad
submission
statute.
further
so
far
as
the
attorney
general’s
power
to
interpret
and
enforce
law
absent
a
definitive
determination,
the
court's
would
agree,
there
is
no
literal
power
in
indiana
law
for
him
to
bind
officials.
however,
he
is
certainly
authorized
by
statute
to
issue
advisory
opinions.
the
election
board
specifically
relied
upon
his
opinion
in
coming
it's
determination
and
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
court's
analysis
in
wiegmann
and
broderick
just
last
term
in
terms
of
the
powers
and
authority
like
the
attorney
general
pointed
to
interpret
a
statute
would
be
of
some
relevance
to
a
determination
in
this
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
there
has
been
such
suggestion
as
i
note
in
the
proceedings.
there
was
a
parallel
state
court
proceeding,
involving
two
sets
of
co-plaintiffs
or
one
set
of
co-plaintiffs,
the
american,
the
indiana
american
independent
party
in
which
again
nobody
surfaced
that
particular
issue,
other
counsels
were
representing
the
independent
party
and
the
attorney
general’s
office
who
may
ever
represented
the
election
board,
did
not
address
the
issue
of
the
oath.
they
were
addressing
other
questions.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
excuse
me.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think
you
have
it,
it
seem
to
me
in
the
colloquy
that
just
proceeded
my
rebuttal
with
justice
marshall,
the
attorney
general
came
right
back
to
an
agreement.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
he
also
agreed
that
other
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
technically,
he
has
his
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
he
has
as
much
power
to
construe
it
i
think
then
the
attorney
general
of
oklahoma
had
to
construe
(voice
overlap)
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
indiana
law.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
state
court
has
had
one
judicial
attempt
to
this
particular
statute
that
has
been
cited
in
both
briefs.
this
later
case
is
a
parallel
statute
in
the
bootash
(ph)
case
and
much
earlier
sedition
statute.
i
think
out
of
them,
you
will
find
a
quite
in
ample
indication
by
the
state
judiciary
what
they
mean
by
advocacy
and
something
more
than
incitement.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
excuse
me
something
considerably
less
than
incitement.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
what
can
i
do
with
it?
it
seem
to
me
that
in
the
chief
justice’s
opinion
in
cole
he
was
at
great
pains
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
perfect
analog
of
support
of
and
he
went
through
any
number
of
steps
to
demonstrate
that
the
first
cause
of
the
oath
was
just
the
slight
a
rephrasing
of
the
support
of
and
the
second
cause
was
just
does
either
surplusage
or
an
additional
rephrasing
of
the
the
support
of
and
was
really
controlled
by
the
first
clause.
we
have
a
quite
a
different
situation.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
certainly
not.
this
oath
was
a
negative
disclaimer,
i
do
not
advocate
found
within
context
of
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
i
think
promising
to
support
overthrow,
although
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
i
have
a
list
of
reasons
for
that
including
one
(voice
overlap)
i
just
stated.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
just
one
good
one.
the
term
advocacy
itself
has
a
different
meaning
than
post.
it
is
a
term
that
has
been
encrusted
by
numerable
decisions
of
this
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
could
check
--
i
can
personally
consciously
take
the
support
of
it
says
i
oppose
overthrow
of
government.
if
i
were
put
to
such
as
support
of
meaning
that
i
oppose
that
as
policy,
so
far
as
i
know
the
conditions
existing
in
this
government
at
this
time
i
would
support
the
constitution
and
all
of
that.
i
might
also
refuse
to
take
an
oath
that
i
would
be
not
advocate
overthrow
because
the
oath
that
i
do
not
advocate
overthrow
is
too
open
ended
that
really
binds
my
options.
it
is
really
talking
to
if
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
but
is
if
you
are
going
to
do
constitutionally,
that
goes
beyond
the
support
of
it
says
i
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution.
i
can
take
that
oath
i
can
take
it
to
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
which
has
been
ruled
by
this
court
to
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
support
of.
the
advocacy
oath
takes
it
several
steps
further.
it
requires
me
to
bind
my
options
in
even
in
terms
of
hypothetical
consideration
of
a
situation
in
which
say
there
were
no
takeover
the
government
that
attempted
to
reside
within
the
context,
but
not
the
real
fact
of
the
constitution.
i
might
well
advocate
overthrow
if
such
a
contingency
occurred.
so
i
just
do
not
think
that
when
you
put
it
in
a
negative
using
the
term
advocacy
which
has
been
encrusted
with
this
kind
of
an
interpretation
by
the
court,
i
think
rightfully
so.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
i
would
not
take
that
of
you
your
honor.
if
i
found
the
government
objectionable
when
i
found
it
in
the
office
i
would
like
to
say
that
as
a
conscious
of
citizen
i
would
not
take
of,
if
i
found
it
objectionable
in
that
way.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
certainly
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
i
think
i
would
regard
myself
as
not
bound
by
the
oath
as
given.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh
no
not
on
such
a
day-to-day
basis
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
could
agree
as
reasonable
man
living
under
constitution
that
there
are
certain
parameters
within
which
the
constitutional
government
must
remain
in
order
for
us
to
be
bound
by
the
constitution
and
the
oaths.
the
advocacy
provision
if
it
is
encrusted
as
i
say
with
the
dennis
interpretation
and
the
yates
interpretation
and
scales
and
all
that,
it
says
to
the
oath
taker
you
really
have
to
throw
away
that
agreement
on
the
parameters
of
constitutional
government
and
tell
us
that
from
here
on
out
you
will
never
advocate
violence
your
throwing
away
options.
we
do
have
i
do
not
want
hope
to
agreement
when
focused
entirely
on
this
point
because
we
think
that
we
have
some
very
powerful
other
points
in
the
over
breadth
point.
we
do
think
that
articles
two
to
the
extent
that
this
is
a
case
involving
the
federal
law
of
decision
is
absolutely
preclusive
on
the
states.
that
the
states
really
have
no
power
whatsoever
to
impose
any
kind
of
a
condition
on
candidacy
for
president
or
electors
to
the
office
of
president.
that
that
the
open
office
really
precludes
everything
that
otherwise
putting
any
another
condition
on
it
is
an
added
condition
for
office
which
this
court
said
cannot
be
done
at
least
in
the
legislative
context
for
example
in
the
powell
versus
mccormack
case.
so
i
really
want
that
my
argument
to
end
on
this
note
that
we
are
relying
entirely
and
exclusively
on
the
over
breadth
point
and
we
have
other
arguments
as
well.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
is
a
fair
statement,
but
i
really
not
quite
understanding
the
question
or
how
it
is
from
you.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
indeed
it
was
very
much
a
day-to-day
proceeding
with
the
party
being
put
to
fairly
substantial
deadline
which
he
undertook
too
to
me.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
on
the
board
as
well,
but
the
attorney
general’s
opinion
for
example
on
the
party's
ineligibility
if
it
were
to
file
an
affidavit
and
there
is
such
an
opinion
by
the
attorney
general
that
preceded
the
district
court
decision,
it
was
dated
august
28
and
the
party
tendered
its
petitions
on
the
31st
and
the
amended
complaint
was
filed
a
week
later,
the
hearing
was
three
weeks
later,
the
split
decision
came
down
and
then
these
emergency
proceedings
took
place
yes.
so
for
that
reason
among
others
i
think
no
abstention
was
suggested
but
i
do
not
think
abstention
would
have
been
appropriate
under
baggett
and
bullitt
and
dombraski
and
other
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
seems
to
be
your
honor
[attempt
to
laughter],
it
seems
to
be.
we
really
do
try
to
stage
our
cases
in
a
more
orderly
fashion
in
the
election
context,
but
deadlines
took
for
it
us.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
brings
before
the
court
a
challenge
to
a
provision
of
the
indiana
election
law
that
contained
conditions
political
party
access
to
the
ballot
on
the
making
on
a
disclaimer
that
the
party
does
not
advocate
overthrow
of
government
by
force
or
violence.
plaintiff’s
tendered
signatures
on
petitions
for
inclusion
on
the
ballot,
on
august
31st,
1972.
the
defendants,
the
election
board
of
indiana
rejected
the
petitions
the
same
day,
relying
on
the
provision
of
indiana
law
and
an
opinion
rendered
on
august
28
by
the
indiana
attorney
general.
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
affidavit
must
state
the
party
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
local
state
or
national
government
by
force
or
violence
and
that
it
is
not
affiliated
with
and
does
not
cooperate
with
nor
has
any
relation
with
any
foreign
government
or
political
party
or
group
of
individuals
of
any
foreign
government.
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
took
the
statute
a
step
or
so
further
stating
as
to
the
particular
appellants,
the
party
appellants,
the
communist
party
of
indiana
that
“this
communist
party
would
not
be
eligible
to
appear
on
the
indiana
ballot
even
if
its
officers
should
sign
an
affidavit
because
that
would
be
an
obvious
perjury
in
view
of
the
communist
party
stated
purposes
and
those
indiana
officials
who
would
be
responsible
for
placing
the
communist
party
on
the
ballot
could
be
subject
to
federal
criminal
prosecution,
as
well
under
the
smith
act
and
the
communist
control
act,
somewhat
(inaudible).”
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action,
the
communist
party
of
indiana,
the
candidates
for
the
presidency
and
vice
presidency
under
that
banner,
candidates
for
electors
of
the
president
and
the
vice
president
under
that
banner,
a
voter
and
the
class
of
voter
she
would
represent
sued
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
this
indiana
statute.
the
amended
complaint
which
is
the
basic
document
before
the
court
was
filed
on
september
8th,
1972.
a
hearing
was
held
on
september
28th,
1972
and
a
decision
was
conducted
on
the
same
day.
three-judge
district
court
in
indiana
ruled
that
the
affiliation
clause
of
the
statute,
the
statute
prohibiting
affiliation
with
a
foreign
government
or
a
segment
thereof,
was
on
constitution
on
its
face.
it
on
the
other
hand
specifically
validated
the
advocacy
clause.
the
communist
party
as
a
consequence
of
this
action
and
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
it
had
very
limited
time
in
which
to
get
on
the
ballot,
or
to
take
steps
to
get
on
the
ballot
for
the
1972
election,
submitted
a
qualified
affidavit,
pursuing
to
the
order
of
the
court.
in
that
affidavit
the
party
stated
by
its
officers
that
it
did
not
engage
in
the
unlawful
advocacy
or
the
prescribed
advocacy.
it
went
on
to
state
concerned
obviously
with
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
about
the
perjury
sanctions
that
the
term
advocate
used
here
in
has
the
meaning
given
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
yates,
“the
advocacy
and
teaching
of
concrete
action
for
the
forcible
overthrow
of
government
and
not
of
principles
divorced
from
actions.”
so
affidavit
was
tendered
and
rejected
by
the
election
board
on
september
29th
by
a
vote
of
2:1.
thereafter
the
plaintiffs
went
back
to
the
district
court,
requested
an
order
enforcing
the
previous
mandate
of
the
court,
that
order
was
denied
on
october
4th.
a
motion
to
amend
subsequently
made
was
denied
on
october
31st
and
various
attempts
by
the
appellants
here
and
appellees
on
the
other
side
were
also
rejected
in
an
emergency
posture
by
this
court.
both
sides
then
took
appeals
from
the
two
different
decisions
of
the
three
judge
court.
on
march
19,
1973,
this
court
summarily
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
three
judge
district
court
to
the
extent
that
that
court
had
invalidated
the
affiliation
clause
of
the
indiana
statute.
the
same
time,
the
instant
case,
the
appeal
by
the
communist
party,
its
candidates
and
voters,
the
court
entered
an
order
stating
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
has
been
postponed
to
the
hearing
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
now
what
appellants
take
to
be
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
at
this
point,
after
all
the
emergency
appeals
had
been
rendered
and
after
the
various
actions
have
been
taken
in
the
district
court
is
the
question
of
the
timeliness
of
the
appeal
and
i
would
like
to
rest,
so
far
as
that
question
is
concerned
on
the
brief.
we
brief
that
extensively,
possibly
too
extensively
but
since
the
question
was
reserved
and
this
was
the
question
that
appeared
to
us
to
be
the
jurisdictional
question,
we
had
briefed
that
from
pages
13
to
15
in
the
appellant's
brief
and
unless
the
court
desire
specific
argument
on
that
issue,
i
would
rest
on
the
brief
and
turn
to
the
merits.
plaintiff’s
request
to
this
court
to
reverse
and
remand
through
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
void
the
advocacy
provision
of
the
indiana
statute.
we
have
a
number
of
arguments
which
i
think
we
have
fairly
extensively
briefed
but
it
might
be
helpful
to
go
over
them
in
order.
our
first
point
concerns
the
nature
of
voting
a
standing
for
public
office
and
of
political
parties.
these
are
clearly
fundamental
interests,
enumerable
decisions
of
this
court
have
stated
that
the
right
to
vote
is
the
fountainhead
of
democratic
rights
in
our
society.
in
the
bullock
and
carter
decision
the
court
indicated
that
the
rights
of
the
candidacy
are
so
bound
up
with
the
right
to
vote
that
they
are
basically
inseparable,
and
of
course
in
williams
and
rhodes,
and
other
decisions
the
court
has
indicated
its
extreme
sensitivity
to
the
need
of
the
candidates
and
voters
to
be
affiliated
with
the
political
parties
that
are
able
to
place
on
the
ballot
of
a
state
or
of
a
national
election.
candidates
who
are
sponsored
and
clearly
stated
to
be
sponsored
by
given
political
parties.
to
this
extent
then,
this
case
involves
what
the
court
has
characterized
as
fundamental
interests
and
it
renders
this
case,
this
appeal
different
from
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
evaluated
oaths
in
other
contexts.
this
is
different
from
an
employment
oath
context,
it
is
different
from
a
bar
admission
context.
in
neither
of
those
other
context,
you
have
the
interest
that
is
being
withheld
as
a
result
of
the
oath,
achieve
the
kind
of
fundamental
interest
that
this
court
has
this
fine
voting
and
candidacy
and
political
association.
the
interest
itself,
the
vote,
the
candidacy.
in
those
cases
you
have
had
a
situation
in
which
an
interest
admittedly
a
valuable
interest,
has
been
conditioned
upon
the
giving
of
an
oath
or
an
affidavit,
and
evaluating
the
oath
or
affidavit,
the
court
has
been
looking
however,
so
far
as
the
constitutional
dimension
is
concerned
only
at
the
oath
or
the
affidavit
itself.
here
you
have
to
look
at
both,
both
have
first
amendment
dimensions,
the
vote,
the
candidacy
and
all,
and
also
the
affidavit,
involves
a
first
amendment
dimension.
now
we
submit
with
this
context
set
of
the
primacy
of
voting
that
the
state
has
an
enormous
burden
of
the
persuasion
of
the
necessity,
for
any
limitation
upon
voting
or
candidacy
particularly
a
limitation
that
may
encroach
itself
upon
first
amendment
rights,
by
enquiring
into
political
motivation
or
ideology
of
a
candidate
or
a
party.
the
state
has
no
such
legitimate,
nor
even
nor
certainly
compelling
interest
in
so
conditioning
voting
and
candidacy.
state
on
one
or
another
has
spoken
a
fraud
and
spurious
candidacies,
well
it
is
a
little
late
in
the
day
for
anybody
to
be
suggesting
that
the
efforts
of
the
communist
party
of
indiana
or
of
the
united
states
to
place
candidates
before
the
electorate
are
fraudulent
or
spurious.
it
is
a
political
party,
it
has
been
a
political
party
in
this
country
for
enumerable
years,
and
it
has
fielded
candidates
for
ohio
office
throughout
most
of
the
years
that
it
has
been
a
party
in
this
country.
subversion,
the
state
points
to
or
the
avoidance
of
subversion
as
being
a
legitimate
and
compelling
interest.
indeed
that
is
a
legitimate
interest.
obviously
the
state
has
an
interest
in
avoiding
its
subversion.
so
does
the
national
government.
well
it
is
a
compelling
interest
in
this
context
is
much
more
open
to
doubt,
we
think
actually
it
is
not
open
to
doubt,
it
is
not
a
compelling
interest.
the
state
is
asking
an
oath
three
steps
away
from
office
taking
itself.
to
get
on
the
ballot,
you
have
to
execute
the
oath,
to
get
to
the
point
where
you
can
subvert
the
government
from
within,
if
that
is
the
state’s
interest
in,
and
i
can't
conceive
of
another
interest
that
the
state
might
have
and
categorize
it
as
legitimate.
to
get
to
the
point
of
subverting
the
government,
you
got
to
win
the
election,
and
then
the
government
by
the
constitution,
article
6
and
article
2,
can
certainly
give
the
support
oath
and
screen
out
people
who
can
not
take
the
support
oath
before
office
taking
occurs.
so
this
oath
is
placed
in
to
steps
before
office
taking,
it
is
quite
an
enormous
offense,
the
state
is
placing
around
its
interest
in
avoiding
subversion.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
as
i
understand
it
to
mean
the
state
has
to
come
forward
with
an
interest
that--
i
don’t
want
to
use
the
term
outbalances,
well
i
think
the
court's
analysis
in
the
robel
case
of
how
legislation
is
to
evaluated
in
terms
of
compelling
interest
is
perhaps
is
the
most
apt,
as
i
recall
it
was
in
a
footnote,
in
the
robel
case
that
the
court
discussed
the
fact
that
it
wasn’t
talking
about
balancing
as
such,
it
recognized
on
the
one
hand
that
freedom
of
speech
is
an
important
interest
to
our
society
and
our
government.
on
the
other
hand
avoidance
of
subversion
in
sabotage
is
an
important
interest
as
well.
when
these
two
come
at
one
another,
seem
to
be
in
conflict
then
the
court
must
fall
back
to
a
somewhat
different
analysis
and
not
try
to
balance
one
against
the
other
necessarily
but
to
try
to
evaluate
whether
the
state
has
or
the
government
has
some
alternative
ways
of
securing
the
legitimate
interest
which
is
compelling
and
in
that
case
as
you
recall
justice
stewart,
the
court
ruled
that
the
federal
government
didn’t
demonstrated
lacked
alternative
ways
and
in
this
case
too.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
alright,
constitutionally
i
think
it
first
means
that
a
burden
of
proof
is
shifted,
a
burden
of
constitutional
proof,
whereas
initially
one
who
comes
in
to
challenge
a
state
law,
has
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
state
law
is
bad,
wholly
on
his
or
her
shoulders,
when
you
establish
a
fundamental
interest
or
if
you
are
dealing
with
the
equal
protect
clause
of
course
of
suspect
classification,
then
the
burden
of
proof
shifts.
first
the
burden
of
going
forward,
if
you
want
to
talk
in
evidentiary
terms
shifts
to
the
government
to
come
up
with
some
legitimate
reasons,
some
reasons
that
go
beyond
mere
rationality
which
would
be
the
ordinary
standard
to
be
applied
in
the
equal
protection
or
the
due
process
area.
now
having
come
up
with
these
legitimate
reasons
when
the
court
states
that
these
reasons
not
only
are
to
be
legitimate
but
also
must
be
compelling,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
is
either
talking
about
a
balancing
test
which
some
members
of
the
court
don’t
view
with
favor
or
it
is
talking
about
police
restrictive
alternative
test
and
in
either
event
it
still
and
also
pertains
i
think
to
a
burden
of
proof.
it
has
now
become
the
burden
of
proof
question
rather
the
burden
of
going
forward
question.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
i
think
so
i
think
robel
indicates
that
it
has
some
relevance
outside
of
that
area,
i
know
that
it
first
originated
in
the
equal
protection
clause
but
as
it
seems
to
me
in
the
later
decisions
of
the
court
to
be
something
of
a
spillover
into
a
first
amendment
area
because
of
the
parallelity
in
the
two
tests--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
certainly.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
would
certainly
argue
that
your
honor
but
the
state
i
am
sure
would
come
back
and
try
to
fantasize
circumstances
in
which
a
law
could
be
justifies
even--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
precisely.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
i
would
not
want
to
try
to
meet
the
hypotheticals
at
this
point
that
the
state
might
attempt
to
articulate,
but
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
stewart
that
if
it
is
an
invasion
of
the
first
amendment--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
however
once
you
move
to
through
the
opinions
of
this
court,
we
are
caught
up
with
sometimes
analysis
that
talks
about
compelling
interest
and
sometimes
analysis
that
talks
about
least
restrictive
alternative.
i
think
in
large
part
on
the
basis
of
a
legitimate
desire
and
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
avoid
facing
the
pure
first
amendment
question
unless
it
has
to,
so
the
court
presumably
would
decide
the
case
on
overbreath
and
vagueness
grounds.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
secondary
argument
that
we
would
agree
with
your
initial
agreement
that
is
if
this
is
an
invasion
of
the
first
amendment
and
over
breath--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
excuse
me
a
question
that
would
be
the
end
of
it,
if
the
court
is
compelled
then
by
its
own
decisions
or
by
its
own
analysis
of
the
issues
to
look
beyond
that
into
something
like
a
compelling
state
interest
or
compelling
governmental
analysis
interest
notion
or
a
least
restrictive
alternative
notion
then
we
would
suggest
the
state
can
not
meet
the
burden
of
proof
of
constitutional
proof
that
would
lodged
on
its
shoulders.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
might
be
shorthand
for
another
kind
of
decision.
i
think
that
from
time
to
time
in
the
opinions
of
the
court
there
is
discussion
of
the
compellingness
or
the
legitimacy
of
the
government’s
interest
in
taking
one
course
of
the
action
or
another.
even
in
some
of
the
decisions
that
involve
overbreath,
i
can't
put
my
fingers
on
them,
i
recently
read
the
broderick
decision
and
i
have
some
vague
recollection,
of
course
that
is
from
last
term
that
they
may
have
been
intimation
of
that
if
not
an
explication
of
it.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
first
amendment
also
it
is
protected
by
our
federalism
to
use
justice
black's
phrase,
it
is
protected
by
article
one
and
article
two.
so
far
as
the--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
the
right
to
vote,
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
this
case
for
the
moment
only
involves
federal
elections,
the
presidents
and
vice
presidents,
the
electors
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
we
were
that
it
is
a
federally
guaranteed
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
it
is
guaranteed
of
course
by
merely
the
statutes
but
we
think
it
is
also
guaranteed
by
articles
one,
two
and
the
various
amendments
to
the
constitution
bearing
upon
voting.
we
think
that---
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
right
of
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
we
think
there
is
the
first
amendment
right
to
vote
which
is
intimated
well.
it
is
not
intimated
in
bond
v.
floyd,
but
something
like
it
is
intimated
in
bond
v.
floyd
that
correlative
right
of
the
candidate
to
take
his
office.
we
think
in
powell
versus
mccormack,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
about
the
interest
of
the
polity
and
being
represented
by
people
they
chose.
i
cannot
say
to
the
court
that
there
was
an
explicit
ruling
of
the
court
that
states
in
so
many
words
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
or
otherwise
guaranteed
federal
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections
i
think
that
is
the
thrust
of
many
of
decisions
of
the
court.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
but
there
has
been
a
lot
of
constitution
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
doubt
that
it
has
been
overruled
and
as
i
say
i
do
not
think
there
has
been
an
explicit
statement
to
that
is
a
federally
protected
right
to
vote.
i
think
there
is
an
intimation
in
many
decision.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh
one
of
our
claims
of
course
is
taking
up
from
justice
stewart's
question
is
that,
there
is
a
first
amendment
dimension
to
the
right
to
vote
and
candidacy.
the
court
certainly
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
alright
in
various
ways
first
how
does
the
advocacy
provision
interfere?
well
first
in
the
very
pragmatic
way
it
interferes
because
the
communist
party
was
precluded
from
the
ballot.
it
attempted
to
articulate
an
advocacy
affidavit
which
was
consistent
with
decisions
of
this
court
namely
the
yates
case
which
was
then
rejected
by
the
defendants
and
appellee.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
is
it
why
is
it
that
it
cannot,
it
does
not
believe
that
it
should.
it
believes
that
it
is
protected
in
its
right
not
to
have
to
make
that
kind
of
mistake
in
order
to
gain
access
to
the
ballot
because
for
several
reasons.
the
oath
that
it
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
government
by
forcing
violence
without
any
further
qualification
goes
well
beyond
all
of
the
oaths
that
this
court
has
hereto
for
validated.
in
any
other
context,
leave
aside
now
the
fact
that
we
think
the
voting
in
candidacy
is
special
context.
this
is
not
the
function
equivalent
to
support
oath
and
in
recent
years
of
these,
the
only
kind
of
oath
that
this
court
has
ballotated
has
been
validated
only
on
the
basis
that
it
is
either
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
support
oath
or
it
is
invoked
strictly
speaking
to
determine
whether
the
person
making
the
oath
is
doing
it
conscientiously
in
terms
of
the
purposes
behind
the
support
oath.
that's
wadman
case
and
the
cole
versus
richardson's
case.
without
any
further
the
qualification,
the
absentee
clause
just
encroaches
well
beyond
a
person's
duty
as
a
citizen
to
stand
up
and
say
that
it
was
supported
to
offend
the
constitution.
it
says
it
requires
them
to
say
i
do
not
advocate
overthrow
by
force
or
violence.
that
language
is
very
very
dangerous
language.
it
is
a
dangerous
language
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
line
of
cases
running
from
dennis
through
yates
through
noto
and
scales
and
robel
brandenburg
because
there
is
a
lot
of
advocacy
of
forcing
violence
that
is
constitutionally
protected.
so
long
as
that
advocacy
is
not
directed
to
inciting
action.
now
we
think
immediate
action,
but
they
did
not
even
get
close
to
that
in
this
case.
so
as
long
as
the
advocacy
is
not
directed
to
the
incitement
of
action.
it
is
constitutionally
protected
in
and
of
itself.
now
we
have
a
number
of
other
arguments
which
go
back
to
the
basic
nature
of
our
federal
system.
we
submit
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
does
it
advocate?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
ask
the
party
or
any
of
its
agents.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
it
advocates
forcing
violence.
i
have
no
idea,
i
do
not
have
that,
the
issue
never
came
up
in
the
proceedings
and
i
do
not
think
it
was
my
obligation
to
ask.
in
the
particular
context
but
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
is
impossible
to
answer
your
honor,
i
would
not
want
to
have
to
answer
that
personally
in
some
circumstances.
so
the
point
being
that
it
is
too
abstract
and
open
ended
question.
alright,
but
we
do
have
certain
other
positions
and
that
is
that
so
far
as
candidacy
in
federal
elections
is
concerned,
so
far
as
that
kind
of
candidacy
is
concerned
the
state
is
limited
to
know
more
than
the
constitutional
oath
of
office
and
as
we
have
already
argued,
this
goes
well
beyond
the
constitutional
support
oath.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
will
it
be
limited?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
do
argue
across
the
board
your
honor
but
in
this
case
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
say
in
federal
elections
only
because
so
last
the
facts
are
involved
a
federal
election
in
this
particular
case
otherwise,
i
assure
you
your
honor,
i
would
be
here
arguing
that
it
cuts
across
the
board
and
we
have
intimated
such
an
argument
in
our
brief.
we
would
invite
the
court
to
go
that
far.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
am
familiar
with
it
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
would
rest
on
that
statement
your
honor
thank
you.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
beyond
the
office
taking.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
just
makes
it
much
more
attenuated
in
terms
of
any
interest
the
government
might
assert.
if
this
were
the
oath
that
the
state
of
indiana
required
of
its
office
takers
we
would
be
here
challenging
it
on
grounds
of
overbreadth.
it
is
not
the
functional
equivalent
that
we
support
of,
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
other
states
that
may
have
similar
statutes,
i
think
is
as
compendium
note
in
emerson,
haber
&
dorsen
at
pages
315
on
the
choice
to
collect
states,
but
that's
out
of
date.
i
understand
a
new
editions
is
coming
out,
there
have
been
states
that
have
similar
oaths.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
i
believe
so.
they
--
they
either
--
candidates
oath
or
party
oaths,
they
tendered
to
merge
them
together
that
would
be
as
many
as
20
who
have
one
kind
of
an
oath
or
another.
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
rebuttal
is,
of
course,
i
think
that
quoting
from
the
1950
communist
party
platform
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
issues
in
this
case
on
innumerable
grounds
that’s
part
of
the
record
in
the
case,
if
it
were,
it
would
be
stale
on
basis
of
many
decisions
to
this
court
involving
communist
party
registration
or
prosecution
so
that
it
is
obviously
a
sport.
on
over
breadth,
in
addition
to
the
cases
already
cited
to
the
court,
so
far
as
the
indiana
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
this
or
similar
statutes
is
concerned,
there
is
one
case
that
had
not
been
cited
so
far
that
state
versus
levitt,
203
ne
2nd
821
(1965)
in
which
the
indiana
supreme
court
impliedly
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
a
broad
submission
statute.
further
so
far
as
the
attorney
general’s
power
to
interpret
and
enforce
law
absent
a
definitive
determination,
the
court's
would
agree,
there
is
no
literal
power
in
indiana
law
for
him
to
bind
officials.
however,
he
is
certainly
authorized
by
statute
to
issue
advisory
opinions.
the
election
board
specifically
relied
upon
his
opinion
in
coming
it's
determination
and
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
court's
analysis
in
wiegmann
and
broderick
just
last
term
in
terms
of
the
powers
and
authority
like
the
attorney
general
pointed
to
interpret
a
statute
would
be
of
some
relevance
to
a
determination
in
this
case.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
there
has
been
such
suggestion
as
i
note
in
the
proceedings.
there
was
a
parallel
state
court
proceeding,
involving
two
sets
of
co-plaintiffs
or
one
set
of
co-plaintiffs,
the
american,
the
indiana
american
independent
party
in
which
again
nobody
surfaced
that
particular
issue,
other
counsels
were
representing
the
independent
party
and
the
attorney
general’s
office
who
may
ever
represented
the
election
board,
did
not
address
the
issue
of
the
oath.
they
were
addressing
other
questions.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
excuse
me.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
think
you
have
it,
it
seem
to
me
in
the
colloquy
that
just
proceeded
my
rebuttal
with
justice
marshall,
the
attorney
general
came
right
back
to
an
agreement.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
he
also
agreed
that
other
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
technically,
he
has
his
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
he
has
as
much
power
to
construe
it
i
think
then
the
attorney
general
of
oklahoma
had
to
construe
(voice
overlap)
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
indiana
law.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
state
court
has
had
one
judicial
attempt
to
this
particular
statute
that
has
been
cited
in
both
briefs.
this
later
case
is
a
parallel
statute
in
the
bootash
(ph)
case
and
much
earlier
sedition
statute.
i
think
out
of
them,
you
will
find
a
quite
in
ample
indication
by
the
state
judiciary
what
they
mean
by
advocacy
and
something
more
than
incitement.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
excuse
me
something
considerably
less
than
incitement.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
what
can
i
do
with
it?
it
seem
to
me
that
in
the
chief
justice’s
opinion
in
cole
he
was
at
great
pains
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
perfect
analog
of
support
of
and
he
went
through
any
number
of
steps
to
demonstrate
that
the
first
cause
of
the
oath
was
just
the
slight
a
rephrasing
of
the
support
of
and
the
second
cause
was
just
does
either
surplusage
or
an
additional
rephrasing
of
the
the
support
of
and
was
really
controlled
by
the
first
clause.
we
have
a
quite
a
different
situation.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
certainly
not.
this
oath
was
a
negative
disclaimer,
i
do
not
advocate
found
within
context
of
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no
i
think
promising
to
support
overthrow,
although
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
i
have
a
list
of
reasons
for
that
including
one
(voice
overlap)
i
just
stated.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
just
one
good
one.
the
term
advocacy
itself
has
a
different
meaning
than
post.
it
is
a
term
that
has
been
encrusted
by
numerable
decisions
of
this
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
could
check
--
i
can
personally
consciously
take
the
support
of
it
says
i
oppose
overthrow
of
government.
if
i
were
put
to
such
as
support
of
meaning
that
i
oppose
that
as
policy,
so
far
as
i
know
the
conditions
existing
in
this
government
at
this
time
i
would
support
the
constitution
and
all
of
that.
i
might
also
refuse
to
take
an
oath
that
i
would
be
not
advocate
overthrow
because
the
oath
that
i
do
not
advocate
overthrow
is
too
open
ended
that
really
binds
my
options.
it
is
really
talking
to
if
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
but
is
if
you
are
going
to
do
constitutionally,
that
goes
beyond
the
support
of
it
says
i
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution.
i
can
take
that
oath
i
can
take
it
to
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
which
has
been
ruled
by
this
court
to
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
support
of.
the
advocacy
oath
takes
it
several
steps
further.
it
requires
me
to
bind
my
options
in
even
in
terms
of
hypothetical
consideration
of
a
situation
in
which
say
there
were
no
takeover
the
government
that
attempted
to
reside
within
the
context,
but
not
the
real
fact
of
the
constitution.
i
might
well
advocate
overthrow
if
such
a
contingency
occurred.
so
i
just
do
not
think
that
when
you
put
it
in
a
negative
using
the
term
advocacy
which
has
been
encrusted
with
this
kind
of
an
interpretation
by
the
court,
i
think
rightfully
so.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
i
would
not
take
that
of
you
your
honor.
if
i
found
the
government
objectionable
when
i
found
it
in
the
office
i
would
like
to
say
that
as
a
conscious
of
citizen
i
would
not
take
of,
if
i
found
it
objectionable
in
that
way.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
certainly
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
i
think
i
would
regard
myself
as
not
bound
by
the
oath
as
given.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh
no
not
on
such
a
day-to-day
basis
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
could
agree
as
reasonable
man
living
under
constitution
that
there
are
certain
parameters
within
which
the
constitutional
government
must
remain
in
order
for
us
to
be
bound
by
the
constitution
and
the
oaths.
the
advocacy
provision
if
it
is
encrusted
as
i
say
with
the
dennis
interpretation
and
the
yates
interpretation
and
scales
and
all
that,
it
says
to
the
oath
taker
you
really
have
to
throw
away
that
agreement
on
the
parameters
of
constitutional
government
and
tell
us
that
from
here
on
out
you
will
never
advocate
violence
your
throwing
away
options.
we
do
have
i
do
not
want
hope
to
agreement
when
focused
entirely
on
this
point
because
we
think
that
we
have
some
very
powerful
other
points
in
the
over
breadth
point.
we
do
think
that
articles
two
to
the
extent
that
this
is
a
case
involving
the
federal
law
of
decision
is
absolutely
preclusive
on
the
states.
that
the
states
really
have
no
power
whatsoever
to
impose
any
kind
of
a
condition
on
candidacy
for
president
or
electors
to
the
office
of
president.
that
that
the
open
office
really
precludes
everything
that
otherwise
putting
any
another
condition
on
it
is
an
added
condition
for
office
which
this
court
said
cannot
be
done
at
least
in
the
legislative
context
for
example
in
the
powell
versus
mccormack
case.
so
i
really
want
that
my
argument
to
end
on
this
note
that
we
are
relying
entirely
and
exclusively
on
the
over
breadth
point
and
we
have
other
arguments
as
well.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
is
a
fair
statement,
but
i
really
not
quite
understanding
the
question
or
how
it
is
from
you.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
indeed
it
was
very
much
a
day-to-day
proceeding
with
the
party
being
put
to
fairly
substantial
deadline
which
he
undertook
too
to
me.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
on
the
board
as
well,
but
the
attorney
general’s
opinion
for
example
on
the
party's
ineligibility
if
it
were
to
file
an
affidavit
and
there
is
such
an
opinion
by
the
attorney
general
that
preceded
the
district
court
decision,
it
was
dated
august
28
and
the
party
tendered
its
petitions
on
the
31st
and
the
amended
complaint
was
filed
a
week
later,
the
hearing
was
three
weeks
later,
the
split
decision
came
down
and
then
these
emergency
proceedings
took
place
yes.
so
for
that
reason
among
others
i
think
no
abstention
was
suggested
but
i
do
not
think
abstention
would
have
been
appropriate
under
baggett
and
bullitt
and
dombraski
and
other
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
seems
to
be
your
honor
[attempt
to
laughter],
it
seems
to
be.
we
really
do
try
to
stage
our
cases
in
a
more
orderly
fashion
in
the
election
context,
but
deadlines
took
for
it
us.
