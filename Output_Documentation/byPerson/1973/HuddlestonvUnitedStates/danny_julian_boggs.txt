mr.
danny
julian
boggs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
essentially
turns
on
the
construction
of
a
single
relatively
simple
english
word,
acquisition,
and
its
root,
acquire.
as
has
already
been
indicated,
the
essential
dictionary
definition
of
this
word
would
be,
to
come
into
possession
of,
when
which
we
perceive
no
basic
ambiguity.
we
would
also
note
that
this
word
is
used
in
correlation
with
the
words
sale
or
other
disposition.
when
the
man
goes
into
the
pawnshop,
or
into
any
transaction,
he
acquires
the
man
in
the
other
side
of
the
counter,
sells
or
disposes.
now
the
word
dispose
and
disposition
itself
appears
throughout
the
statute
as
part
of
the
basic
scheme
of
control
over
the
use
of
firearms,
which
is
in
fact
the
basic
statutory
purpose.
this
court
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor
that's
in
the
court
below,
the
dissenter
stated
he
didn't
acquire,
he
reacquired.
i
find
that
to
be
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
if
a
statute
forbids
sale,
i
hardly
think
that
i
would
get
out
of
it
by
saying
that
i
did
not
sell,
i
resold.
one
could
think
of
a
series
of
verbs
of
that
sort.
and
i
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
if
i
am
forbidden
to
possess
something,
and
i
come
in
and
say,
"well,
your
honor
i
didn?t
really
possess
it,
i
just
repossessed
it."
if
i'm
forbidden
to
possess
heroin
for
example,
and
i'm
up
on
charges
before,
and
so
i
didn't
possess
it,
i
had
it
before.
and
i
now
repossess
it
even
if
we
assume
an
intervening
statute,
or
something
of
that
sort,
i
can
not
see
that
that
argument
would
(voice
overlap).
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
the
question
of
safekeeping
is
of
course
not
this
question,
but
i
think
that
in
terms
of
what
the
word
means,
which
is
to
come
into
control
of,
i
think
that
we
would
probably
have
to
include
that.
i
think
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
decided
here,
but
i
would
point
out
as
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
marshall
said
in
the
bass
case
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
control
the
firearms
related
activities
of
felons
and
other
dangerous
persons.
and
i
trust
that
it
will
not
be
belaboring
the
obvious
to
indicate
that
this
statute
was
passed,
the
debate
was
begun
shortly
after
the
assassination
of
dr.
king.
it
was
in
fact
passed
very
shortly
after
the
assassination
of
senator
kennedy.
and
if
one
considers
the
question
of
a
person
who
has
pawned
the
gun,
or
has
even
put
it
into
storage,
but
that
of
course
is
not
the
question.
who
then
comes
under
one
of
these
four
prohibitions
who
is
convicted
of
a
crime,
becomes
a
fugitive
from
justice,
becomes
a
drug
addict
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
find
it
very
hard,
your
honor,
to
take
that
position.
let's
look
at
the
restriction
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
dealer,
which
is
contained
in
922
(d)
which
states
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
a
licensed
dealer
to
sell
or
otherwise
dispose
of
any
firearm
knowing
that
the
person
is
a
felon
or
a
fugitive
from
justice
or
a
drug
addict.
and
as
i
would
repeat
that
in
light
of
the
--
what
appears
to
me
to
be
the
plain
statutory
language
and
the
purpose,
that
if
we
contemplate
the
situation
in
which
the
man
comes
to
the
dealer
and
says,
"well,
you
know,
you've
got
my
firearm
before,
but
it
really
doesn't
matter
that
i
am
now
a
felon,
or
a
drug
addict,
i
want
my
gun
back."
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
in
this
case,
you
have
a
person
who
is
a
felon,
who
is
a
previously
convicted
felon,
who
comes
to
the
pawnbroker
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
previously
had
them.
he
now
does
not
have
possession.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
possessed
three
guns.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
right,
and
he
now
wishes
to
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
wishes
to
come
in
to
possession,
which
is
the
dictionary
definition
of
acquire.
to
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
that
does
not
fall
directly
within
those
words.
there
may
be
some
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
your
honor,
to
begin
with,
i
think
that
the
uniformed
commercial
code
states
that
the
rights
of
the
various
parties
that
may
be
involved
are
not
dependent
upon
any
indication
of
where
the
title
to
the
weapon
in
fact
lies.
it's
clear
that
the
pawnbroker,
until
the
loan
is
repaid,
has
the
right
to
possession,
and
that
at
the
point
of
which
he
redeems
the
gun,
or
repays
the
loan
he
then
acquires
that
right
to
possession.
for
example
--
if
we
take
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i'm
sorry.
that
may
be,
your
honor
--
i
do
not
feel
that
the
--
that's
certainly
in
passing
this
law
as
a
national
law
that
congress
meant
for
the
import
of
this
important
section
in
this
term
acquisition
to
depend
upon
the
question
of
title.
if
they
had
felt
that
title
or
consideration
were
an
important
aspect,
they
could've
used
words
such
as
limited
to
sale
or
rental.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
a
rental,
all
the
man
gains
that
he
did
not
have
before
his
possession
he
gains
no
title
to
it.
and
this
is
what
mr.
huddleston
gains
here.
he
previously
did
not
have
the
right
to
possession,
and
he
then
gains
the
right
to
possession.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
to
begin
with
not
to
restart
the
quibble
over
the
wife
at
great
length.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
okay.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
right.
alright
he
--
as
you
stated,
he
simply
did
these
things.
the
question
is,
whether
that
transaction
falls
within
the
terms
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that
would
be
our
impression,
yes.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
that
he
always
had
the
ownership
of
the
gun
although,
as
i
indicated
the
relative
rights
don't
depend
on
where
a
title
lay
during
that
period.
we
don't
believe
that
title
as
such
is
dependent
in
this
case.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
have
--
certainly,
i
have
acquired
the
possession
of
it
and
in
terms
of
the
intention
of
the
statute.
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
i
would
think
so.
the
word
is
to
come
into
possession
of.
for
example,
if
we
take
the
situation
of
a
rental
of
a
firearm,
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
word
acquisition
would
not
encompass
a
rental
otherwise,
i,
as
a
previously
convicted
felon
could
go
down
to
my
pawnbroker,
or
other
store,
and
say,
"now
look,
i
want
to
hold
up
a
place
tonight.
loan
me
a
gun."
and
i
wouldn't
have
to
fill
out
a
4473.
i
presumably
would
not
be
barred
by
the
otherwise
disposition
language
from
getting
the
gun,
and
i
could
be
on
my
merry
way
and
seems
extremely
difficult
in
light
of
the
statutory
language
to
say
that
an
acquisition
would
not
contemplate
a
rental,
but
of
course
if
we
do
take
title
as
the
criterion
then
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
would
be
very
apt,
and
presumably
rental
would
not
apply.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
--
if
i
previously
did
not
have
possession
of
it,
i
would
think
that
would
be
covered,
but
that
is
not
a
question
that
we
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
would
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
okay,
your
honor.
it
would
be
my
interpretation
that
the
words
come
into
possession
would
cover
that.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
(inaudible)
the
definition
of
acquisition
being
to
come
into
possession.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
word
is
acquisition,
yes.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
did
not
previously
have
the
gun,
i
thereupon
acquired
it.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
didn't
previously
have
it.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
you
reacquired
it,
if
you
wish
to
put
it
that
way.
i
certainly
think
that
that
acquisition
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
an
acquisition
encompasses
reacquisition
and
reverse
may
not
be
true.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes.
i'll
go
that
far
if
you
feel
that
is
necessary
to
decide
this
case,
because
your
honor,
as
--
if
we
want
to
get
into
the
legislative
history,
senator
tydings
is
one
of
the
persons
supporting,
speaking
for
the
bill,
stated
those
purpose
to
be,
to
keep
dangerous
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people.
and
the
congress
in
setting
up
the
regulations
and
the
statutes,
excuse
me,
the
wording
of
the
statute,
forbad
the
disposition
in
922
(d)
(1).
now
in
each
of
these
cases
where
we're
talking
about
acquisition
from
one
side,
i
believe
that
we're
talking
about
disposition
from
the
other
side.
and
it
seems
perfectly
clear
from
the
language
that
congress
did
not
wish
licensed
dealers
to
be
able
to
dispose
of
guns
to
persons
in
these
prohibited
categories.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
without
the
4473
or
with
the
4473?
when
he
came
in
to
pawn
it,
the
dealer
is
required
--
was
required
to
keep
a
record
of
it
presumably
as
a
receipt.
i
would
point
out
that
the
statute
in
923
(g)
sets
up
the
record
keeping
requirements.
now
i
believe
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
brought
it
in.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright,
and
where
does
it
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
government's
--
the
government
doesn't
want
and
congress
didn't
want
that
gun
to
get
back
into
his
hands
and
in
addition,
i
would
make
this
further
point
about
923
(g).
i
believe
the
counsel
opposite
stated
that,
'well,
this
requirement
was
just
a
treasury.
the
treasury
could
make
those
regulations."
the
statute,
the
923
(g)
says,
that
they
may
make
regulations
with
regard
to
records
of
sales
or
other
disposition,
so
that
if
we
determine
that
this
is
not
a
disposition,
they
may
be
entitled
to
make
no
records
at
all
when
the
gun
goes
out.
now
let
me
raise
a
point
with
regard
to
the
gun
going
out.
the
counsel
opposite
spoke
at
several
points
about
--
well,
under
california
law,
only
the
owner
--
only
the
pawnor
could
redeem
the
gun
and
he
took
that
from
california
financial
code
21201,
which
simply
says
that
the
borrower
may
redeem.
now
the
general
law
of
pawn,
taking
either
for
example,
the
articles
in
cjs,
or
the
specific
laws
in
many
states,
is
that
anyone
with
the
pawn
ticket
may
get
an
item.
the
uniform
commercial
code
specifically
says
that
such
an
interest
is
assignable,
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
california,
pawnbrokers
habitually
return
to
the
pawn
ticket
holder
regardless
of
ownership.
so
that
if
we
cannot
control
the
disposition
of
the
gun,
if
we
cannot
control
the
gun
as
it
goes
out
of
the
shop,
we
have
the
situation
in
which
a
felon,
a
new
felon,
a
different
felon,
or
a
felon
from
a
case
where
it
was
pawned
by
a
non-felon,
may
then
come
in
and
get
the
gun
without
filling
out
any
form
at
all,
which
again
that's
a
large
hole
in
the
purpose
of
the
statute
being
to
control
the
disposition
of
firearms
into
the
hands
of
people
in
these
prohibited
categories.
i
believe
we
have
indicated
the
statutory
contexts,
these
words
are
used.
i
would
like
to
make
an
additional
point
with
regard
to
the
definition
of
pawnbrokers.
under
the
old
national
firearms
act,
the
wording
was
exactly
as
it
is
in
the
present
one
that
dealers
are
persons
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
firearms
at
wholesale
or
retail.
under
that
act,
pawnbrokers
were
licensed
in
the
same
way
as
any
other
person
who
was
selling
at
wholesale
or
retail.
now
we
had
some
discussion
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
bowl
of
a
watch
swap,
but
it
would
certainly
appear
to
me
that
in
any
indication
of
what
was
a
sale,
if
one
tried
to
escape
by
saying,
"i
sold
the
gun
not
for
money,
but
for
a
bowl
of
a
watch."
he
would
certainly
not
be
able
to
get
out
from
under
that.
so
that
the
congressional
action
in
adding
the
wording
that
pawnbrokers
defined
as
people
who
merely
take
pledges
of
guns
are
under
the
act
and
in
the
report
accompanying
it
specifically
stating
that
pawnbrokers
who
deal
in
firearms,
rather
than
those
who
sell
them
are
under
the
act,
would
certainly
be
a
strong
indication
that
something
in
addition
to
mere
sales
would
have
been
included.
we
--
we've
discussed
the
922
(d),
the
question
of
other
disposition.
this
is
i
believe
a
rather
important
policy
implication
that's
concerned
here,
and
that
gets
us
to
the
question
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
with
regard
to
the
laisure
case
that
in
laisure,
the
court
specifically
said,
"well,
we
believe
that
other
disposition
is
broader
than
acquisition."
and
that
this
was
where
they
found
the
ambiguity.
now
on
the
face
of
it,
we
believe
that
the
use
of
these
words
in
922
(a)
(6)
implies
that
they
are
correlative,
but
given
the
use
of
disposition
at
many
other
points
throughout
the
statute,
i
think
it's
important
that
we
carefully
consider
which
of
these
two,
let
us
say
conflicting
interpretations
we
might
adopt.
if
we
follow
the
lead
of
the
laisure
court,
and
said
that
this
is
not
an
acquisition,
but
it
is
indeed
a
disposition,
then
it
would
appear
that
the
arguments
and
the
evils
that
the
counsel
opposite
was
attacking
would
be
futile,
because
although
he
perhaps
would
be
able
to
wiggle
out
under
922
(a)
(6),
he
couldn't
get
the
gun
back
under
922
(d)
(1)
because
the
dealer
couldn't
dispose
of
it
to
him.
he
might
still
have
to
fill
out
the
form
because
we
can
keep
records
of
dispositions
so
that
the
logic
of
the
laisure
court
on
that
aspect
seems
highly
tenuous.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
would
not
be
criminally
liable
under
922
(a)
(6).
he
would
however,
under
924
(a)
because
he
would've
made
a
false
statement
with
respect
to
the
information
required
to
be
kept.
so
long
as
we
hold
that
it
is
a
disposition,
so
that
to
undertake
this
type
of
what
we
would
consider
a
torturous
construction
of
the
word
acquisition
simply
to
knock
out
this
one
portion
of
the
statute
while
leaving
intact
all
of
the
reasons
essentially
that
we
knocked
it
out
would
seem
to
be
a
futile
exercise.
if
the
ambiguity
were
related
to
some
action
which
did
not
give
mr.
huddleston
fair
warning,
if
it
involved
a
classic
grammatical
conundrum,
as
i
think
the
bass
case
did,
there
might
be
on
sounder
ground
in
invoking
the
rule
of
lenity
through
ambiguity.
but
here
we
had
a
perfectly
clearly
expressed
intention
for
record
keeping.
we
had
a
perfectly
thoroughly
expressed
statement
which
mr.
huddleston
saw
on
the
form
that
he
should
not
lie
on
this
form.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
i
think
that
any
form
of
words
as
it
stated
would
be
appropriate.
i
think
he
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
has
a
right
to
possess
or
to
repossess
it.
if
he
were
not
the
original
pawnor,
but
were
the
holder
of
the
pawn
ticket,
he
would
be
able
to
possess.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
could
well
be.
could
well
be,
i
don't
see
that
that
affects
the
statute.
we're
willing
to
concede,
i
believe
if
you
want
to
use
that
term,
that
he
did
--
that
he
reacquired
the
gun.
we'd
certainly
say
that
reacquire
falls
within
the
meaning
of
acquire
just
as
resale,
or
re-rent.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
to
deal
with
--
to
uphold
this
con
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
to
uphold
this
conviction
where
we'll
--
we're
willing
to
say
that
he
repossessed
rather
than
possessed,
but
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
same
example
that
we
gave
just
a
moment
ago.
i
believe
we've
also
pointed
out
that
the
policy
implications
concerning
the
whole
that
this
would
knock
in
the
statute
if
we
take
out
the
example
--
the
wording
of
other
disposition
is
a
rather
serious
one
that
while
this
case
would
of
course
only
involve
turning
mr.
huddleston
lose.
i
think
that
we
would've
invoked
considerable
confusion
in
the
administration
of
the
statute
throughout
the
country
as
pawnbrokers
and
others
would
say,
"well
now,
are
we
--
what
is
the
case
with
rental,
what
is
the
case
with
gift?"
rather
than
staying
with
the
straightforward
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
acquisition,
meaning
to
come
into
possession,
which
is
perfectly
in
line
with
the
statutory
purpose
of
keeping
dangerous
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
i'm
off
the
top
of
my
head.
i'd
say
that
i've
--
do
not
see
that
as
a
distinctly
broader
word.
if
we
look
at
the
word
disposition,
in
most
dictionaries,
dispose
of
is
defined
as
to
transfer
into
somebody
else's
hand.
the
acquisition
--
if
you
think
about
it
a
little
bit
in
terms
of
drafting
language,
i
think
that
acquisition
is
a
word
peculiarly
connoting
taking
from
this
side
or
as
transfer
would
not.
as
a
draftsman,
i
think
perhaps
if
you
were
saying
in
connection
with
the
transfer
of
it,
it
would
not
have
quite
the
same
connotation
of
taking
from
the
side
of
the
new
possessor
or
to
repossess.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that
would
be
another
possibility.
again
in
some
of
the
dictionaries,
i
looked
up
five
or
six
of
them,
indicate
that
to
acquire
is
to
receive,
and
receive
is
also
in
many
places
defined
as
to
take
into
possession,
which
is
the
same
definition
as
acquire.
i
don't
believe
that
this
type
of
inquiry
as
to
what
might
have
been
a
slightly
more
felicitous
phrase
in
the
minds
of
a
draftsman
can
alter
the
basic
and
straightforward
statement
that
to
acquire
is
to
come
into
possession
of,
which
is
exactly
what
mr.
huddleston
did
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
submit.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
essentially
turns
on
the
construction
of
a
single
relatively
simple
english
word,
acquisition,
and
its
root,
acquire.
as
has
already
been
indicated,
the
essential
dictionary
definition
of
this
word
would
be,
to
come
into
possession
of,
when
which
we
perceive
no
basic
ambiguity.
we
would
also
note
that
this
word
is
used
in
correlation
with
the
words
sale
or
other
disposition.
when
the
man
goes
into
the
pawnshop,
or
into
any
transaction,
he
acquires
the
man
in
the
other
side
of
the
counter,
sells
or
disposes.
now
the
word
dispose
and
disposition
itself
appears
throughout
the
statute
as
part
of
the
basic
scheme
of
control
over
the
use
of
firearms,
which
is
in
fact
the
basic
statutory
purpose.
this
court
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor
that's
in
the
court
below,
the
dissenter
stated
he
didn't
acquire,
he
reacquired.
i
find
that
to
be
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
if
a
statute
forbids
sale,
i
hardly
think
that
i
would
get
out
of
it
by
saying
that
i
did
not
sell,
i
resold.
one
could
think
of
a
series
of
verbs
of
that
sort.
and
i
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
if
i
am
forbidden
to
possess
something,
and
i
come
in
and
say,
"well,
your
honor
i
didn?t
really
possess
it,
i
just
repossessed
it."
if
i'm
forbidden
to
possess
heroin
for
example,
and
i'm
up
on
charges
before,
and
so
i
didn't
possess
it,
i
had
it
before.
and
i
now
repossess
it
even
if
we
assume
an
intervening
statute,
or
something
of
that
sort,
i
can
not
see
that
that
argument
would
(voice
overlap).
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
the
question
of
safekeeping
is
of
course
not
this
question,
but
i
think
that
in
terms
of
what
the
word
means,
which
is
to
come
into
control
of,
i
think
that
we
would
probably
have
to
include
that.
i
think
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
decided
here,
but
i
would
point
out
as
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
marshall
said
in
the
bass
case
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
control
the
firearms
related
activities
of
felons
and
other
dangerous
persons.
and
i
trust
that
it
will
not
be
belaboring
the
obvious
to
indicate
that
this
statute
was
passed,
the
debate
was
begun
shortly
after
the
assassination
of
dr.
king.
it
was
in
fact
passed
very
shortly
after
the
assassination
of
senator
kennedy.
and
if
one
considers
the
question
of
a
person
who
has
pawned
the
gun,
or
has
even
put
it
into
storage,
but
that
of
course
is
not
the
question.
who
then
comes
under
one
of
these
four
prohibitions
who
is
convicted
of
a
crime,
becomes
a
fugitive
from
justice,
becomes
a
drug
addict
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
find
it
very
hard,
your
honor,
to
take
that
position.
let's
look
at
the
restriction
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
dealer,
which
is
contained
in
922
(d)
which
states
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
a
licensed
dealer
to
sell
or
otherwise
dispose
of
any
firearm
knowing
that
the
person
is
a
felon
or
a
fugitive
from
justice
or
a
drug
addict.
and
as
i
would
repeat
that
in
light
of
the
--
what
appears
to
me
to
be
the
plain
statutory
language
and
the
purpose,
that
if
we
contemplate
the
situation
in
which
the
man
comes
to
the
dealer
and
says,
"well,
you
know,
you've
got
my
firearm
before,
but
it
really
doesn't
matter
that
i
am
now
a
felon,
or
a
drug
addict,
i
want
my
gun
back."
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
in
this
case,
you
have
a
person
who
is
a
felon,
who
is
a
previously
convicted
felon,
who
comes
to
the
pawnbroker
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
previously
had
them.
he
now
does
not
have
possession.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
possessed
three
guns.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
right,
and
he
now
wishes
to
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
wishes
to
come
in
to
possession,
which
is
the
dictionary
definition
of
acquire.
to
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
that
does
not
fall
directly
within
those
words.
there
may
be
some
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
your
honor,
to
begin
with,
i
think
that
the
uniformed
commercial
code
states
that
the
rights
of
the
various
parties
that
may
be
involved
are
not
dependent
upon
any
indication
of
where
the
title
to
the
weapon
in
fact
lies.
it's
clear
that
the
pawnbroker,
until
the
loan
is
repaid,
has
the
right
to
possession,
and
that
at
the
point
of
which
he
redeems
the
gun,
or
repays
the
loan
he
then
acquires
that
right
to
possession.
for
example
--
if
we
take
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i'm
sorry.
that
may
be,
your
honor
--
i
do
not
feel
that
the
--
that's
certainly
in
passing
this
law
as
a
national
law
that
congress
meant
for
the
import
of
this
important
section
in
this
term
acquisition
to
depend
upon
the
question
of
title.
if
they
had
felt
that
title
or
consideration
were
an
important
aspect,
they
could've
used
words
such
as
limited
to
sale
or
rental.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
a
rental,
all
the
man
gains
that
he
did
not
have
before
his
possession
he
gains
no
title
to
it.
and
this
is
what
mr.
huddleston
gains
here.
he
previously
did
not
have
the
right
to
possession,
and
he
then
gains
the
right
to
possession.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
to
begin
with
not
to
restart
the
quibble
over
the
wife
at
great
length.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
okay.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
right.
alright
he
--
as
you
stated,
he
simply
did
these
things.
the
question
is,
whether
that
transaction
falls
within
the
terms
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that
would
be
our
impression,
yes.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
that
he
always
had
the
ownership
of
the
gun
although,
as
i
indicated
the
relative
rights
don't
depend
on
where
a
title
lay
during
that
period.
we
don't
believe
that
title
as
such
is
dependent
in
this
case.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
have
--
certainly,
i
have
acquired
the
possession
of
it
and
in
terms
of
the
intention
of
the
statute.
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
i
would
think
so.
the
word
is
to
come
into
possession
of.
for
example,
if
we
take
the
situation
of
a
rental
of
a
firearm,
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
word
acquisition
would
not
encompass
a
rental
otherwise,
i,
as
a
previously
convicted
felon
could
go
down
to
my
pawnbroker,
or
other
store,
and
say,
"now
look,
i
want
to
hold
up
a
place
tonight.
loan
me
a
gun."
and
i
wouldn't
have
to
fill
out
a
4473.
i
presumably
would
not
be
barred
by
the
otherwise
disposition
language
from
getting
the
gun,
and
i
could
be
on
my
merry
way
and
seems
extremely
difficult
in
light
of
the
statutory
language
to
say
that
an
acquisition
would
not
contemplate
a
rental,
but
of
course
if
we
do
take
title
as
the
criterion
then
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
would
be
very
apt,
and
presumably
rental
would
not
apply.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
--
if
i
previously
did
not
have
possession
of
it,
i
would
think
that
would
be
covered,
but
that
is
not
a
question
that
we
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
would
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
okay,
your
honor.
it
would
be
my
interpretation
that
the
words
come
into
possession
would
cover
that.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
(inaudible)
the
definition
of
acquisition
being
to
come
into
possession.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
word
is
acquisition,
yes.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
did
not
previously
have
the
gun,
i
thereupon
acquired
it.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
didn't
previously
have
it.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
you
reacquired
it,
if
you
wish
to
put
it
that
way.
i
certainly
think
that
that
acquisition
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
an
acquisition
encompasses
reacquisition
and
reverse
may
not
be
true.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes.
i'll
go
that
far
if
you
feel
that
is
necessary
to
decide
this
case,
because
your
honor,
as
--
if
we
want
to
get
into
the
legislative
history,
senator
tydings
is
one
of
the
persons
supporting,
speaking
for
the
bill,
stated
those
purpose
to
be,
to
keep
dangerous
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people.
and
the
congress
in
setting
up
the
regulations
and
the
statutes,
excuse
me,
the
wording
of
the
statute,
forbad
the
disposition
in
922
(d)
(1).
now
in
each
of
these
cases
where
we're
talking
about
acquisition
from
one
side,
i
believe
that
we're
talking
about
disposition
from
the
other
side.
and
it
seems
perfectly
clear
from
the
language
that
congress
did
not
wish
licensed
dealers
to
be
able
to
dispose
of
guns
to
persons
in
these
prohibited
categories.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
without
the
4473
or
with
the
4473?
when
he
came
in
to
pawn
it,
the
dealer
is
required
--
was
required
to
keep
a
record
of
it
presumably
as
a
receipt.
i
would
point
out
that
the
statute
in
923
(g)
sets
up
the
record
keeping
requirements.
now
i
believe
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
brought
it
in.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright,
and
where
does
it
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
government's
--
the
government
doesn't
want
and
congress
didn't
want
that
gun
to
get
back
into
his
hands
and
in
addition,
i
would
make
this
further
point
about
923
(g).
i
believe
the
counsel
opposite
stated
that,
'well,
this
requirement
was
just
a
treasury.
the
treasury
could
make
those
regulations."
the
statute,
the
923
(g)
says,
that
they
may
make
regulations
with
regard
to
records
of
sales
or
other
disposition,
so
that
if
we
determine
that
this
is
not
a
disposition,
they
may
be
entitled
to
make
no
records
at
all
when
the
gun
goes
out.
now
let
me
raise
a
point
with
regard
to
the
gun
going
out.
the
counsel
opposite
spoke
at
several
points
about
--
well,
under
california
law,
only
the
owner
--
only
the
pawnor
could
redeem
the
gun
and
he
took
that
from
california
financial
code
21201,
which
simply
says
that
the
borrower
may
redeem.
now
the
general
law
of
pawn,
taking
either
for
example,
the
articles
in
cjs,
or
the
specific
laws
in
many
states,
is
that
anyone
with
the
pawn
ticket
may
get
an
item.
the
uniform
commercial
code
specifically
says
that
such
an
interest
is
assignable,
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
california,
pawnbrokers
habitually
return
to
the
pawn
ticket
holder
regardless
of
ownership.
so
that
if
we
cannot
control
the
disposition
of
the
gun,
if
we
cannot
control
the
gun
as
it
goes
out
of
the
shop,
we
have
the
situation
in
which
a
felon,
a
new
felon,
a
different
felon,
or
a
felon
from
a
case
where
it
was
pawned
by
a
non-felon,
may
then
come
in
and
get
the
gun
without
filling
out
any
form
at
all,
which
again
that's
a
large
hole
in
the
purpose
of
the
statute
being
to
control
the
disposition
of
firearms
into
the
hands
of
people
in
these
prohibited
categories.
i
believe
we
have
indicated
the
statutory
contexts,
these
words
are
used.
i
would
like
to
make
an
additional
point
with
regard
to
the
definition
of
pawnbrokers.
under
the
old
national
firearms
act,
the
wording
was
exactly
as
it
is
in
the
present
one
that
dealers
are
persons
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
firearms
at
wholesale
or
retail.
under
that
act,
pawnbrokers
were
licensed
in
the
same
way
as
any
other
person
who
was
selling
at
wholesale
or
retail.
now
we
had
some
discussion
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
bowl
of
a
watch
swap,
but
it
would
certainly
appear
to
me
that
in
any
indication
of
what
was
a
sale,
if
one
tried
to
escape
by
saying,
"i
sold
the
gun
not
for
money,
but
for
a
bowl
of
a
watch."
he
would
certainly
not
be
able
to
get
out
from
under
that.
so
that
the
congressional
action
in
adding
the
wording
that
pawnbrokers
defined
as
people
who
merely
take
pledges
of
guns
are
under
the
act
and
in
the
report
accompanying
it
specifically
stating
that
pawnbrokers
who
deal
in
firearms,
rather
than
those
who
sell
them
are
under
the
act,
would
certainly
be
a
strong
indication
that
something
in
addition
to
mere
sales
would
have
been
included.
we
--
we've
discussed
the
922
(d),
the
question
of
other
disposition.
this
is
i
believe
a
rather
important
policy
implication
that's
concerned
here,
and
that
gets
us
to
the
question
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
with
regard
to
the
laisure
case
that
in
laisure,
the
court
specifically
said,
"well,
we
believe
that
other
disposition
is
broader
than
acquisition."
and
that
this
was
where
they
found
the
ambiguity.
now
on
the
face
of
it,
we
believe
that
the
use
of
these
words
in
922
(a)
(6)
implies
that
they
are
correlative,
but
given
the
use
of
disposition
at
many
other
points
throughout
the
statute,
i
think
it's
important
that
we
carefully
consider
which
of
these
two,
let
us
say
conflicting
interpretations
we
might
adopt.
if
we
follow
the
lead
of
the
laisure
court,
and
said
that
this
is
not
an
acquisition,
but
it
is
indeed
a
disposition,
then
it
would
appear
that
the
arguments
and
the
evils
that
the
counsel
opposite
was
attacking
would
be
futile,
because
although
he
perhaps
would
be
able
to
wiggle
out
under
922
(a)
(6),
he
couldn't
get
the
gun
back
under
922
(d)
(1)
because
the
dealer
couldn't
dispose
of
it
to
him.
he
might
still
have
to
fill
out
the
form
because
we
can
keep
records
of
dispositions
so
that
the
logic
of
the
laisure
court
on
that
aspect
seems
highly
tenuous.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
would
not
be
criminally
liable
under
922
(a)
(6).
he
would
however,
under
924
(a)
because
he
would've
made
a
false
statement
with
respect
to
the
information
required
to
be
kept.
so
long
as
we
hold
that
it
is
a
disposition,
so
that
to
undertake
this
type
of
what
we
would
consider
a
torturous
construction
of
the
word
acquisition
simply
to
knock
out
this
one
portion
of
the
statute
while
leaving
intact
all
of
the
reasons
essentially
that
we
knocked
it
out
would
seem
to
be
a
futile
exercise.
if
the
ambiguity
were
related
to
some
action
which
did
not
give
mr.
huddleston
fair
warning,
if
it
involved
a
classic
grammatical
conundrum,
as
i
think
the
bass
case
did,
there
might
be
on
sounder
ground
in
invoking
the
rule
of
lenity
through
ambiguity.
but
here
we
had
a
perfectly
clearly
expressed
intention
for
record
keeping.
we
had
a
perfectly
thoroughly
expressed
statement
which
mr.
huddleston
saw
on
the
form
that
he
should
not
lie
on
this
form.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
i
think
that
any
form
of
words
as
it
stated
would
be
appropriate.
i
think
he
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
has
a
right
to
possess
or
to
repossess
it.
if
he
were
not
the
original
pawnor,
but
were
the
holder
of
the
pawn
ticket,
he
would
be
able
to
possess.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
could
well
be.
could
well
be,
i
don't
see
that
that
affects
the
statute.
we're
willing
to
concede,
i
believe
if
you
want
to
use
that
term,
that
he
did
--
that
he
reacquired
the
gun.
we'd
certainly
say
that
reacquire
falls
within
the
meaning
of
acquire
just
as
resale,
or
re-rent.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
to
deal
with
--
to
uphold
this
con
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
to
uphold
this
conviction
where
we'll
--
we're
willing
to
say
that
he
repossessed
rather
than
possessed,
but
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
same
example
that
we
gave
just
a
moment
ago.
i
believe
we've
also
pointed
out
that
the
policy
implications
concerning
the
whole
that
this
would
knock
in
the
statute
if
we
take
out
the
example
--
the
wording
of
other
disposition
is
a
rather
serious
one
that
while
this
case
would
of
course
only
involve
turning
mr.
huddleston
lose.
i
think
that
we
would've
invoked
considerable
confusion
in
the
administration
of
the
statute
throughout
the
country
as
pawnbrokers
and
others
would
say,
"well
now,
are
we
--
what
is
the
case
with
rental,
what
is
the
case
with
gift?"
rather
than
staying
with
the
straightforward
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
acquisition,
meaning
to
come
into
possession,
which
is
perfectly
in
line
with
the
statutory
purpose
of
keeping
dangerous
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
i'm
off
the
top
of
my
head.
i'd
say
that
i've
--
do
not
see
that
as
a
distinctly
broader
word.
if
we
look
at
the
word
disposition,
in
most
dictionaries,
dispose
of
is
defined
as
to
transfer
into
somebody
else's
hand.
the
acquisition
--
if
you
think
about
it
a
little
bit
in
terms
of
drafting
language,
i
think
that
acquisition
is
a
word
peculiarly
connoting
taking
from
this
side
or
as
transfer
would
not.
as
a
draftsman,
i
think
perhaps
if
you
were
saying
in
connection
with
the
transfer
of
it,
it
would
not
have
quite
the
same
connotation
of
taking
from
the
side
of
the
new
possessor
or
to
repossess.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that
would
be
another
possibility.
again
in
some
of
the
dictionaries,
i
looked
up
five
or
six
of
them,
indicate
that
to
acquire
is
to
receive,
and
receive
is
also
in
many
places
defined
as
to
take
into
possession,
which
is
the
same
definition
as
acquire.
i
don't
believe
that
this
type
of
inquiry
as
to
what
might
have
been
a
slightly
more
felicitous
phrase
in
the
minds
of
a
draftsman
can
alter
the
basic
and
straightforward
statement
that
to
acquire
is
to
come
into
possession
of,
which
is
exactly
what
mr.
huddleston
did
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
submit.
