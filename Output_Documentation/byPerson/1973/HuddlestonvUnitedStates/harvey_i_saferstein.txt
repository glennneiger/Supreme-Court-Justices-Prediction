mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
conviction
of
william
carol
huddleston
for
violating
title
18,
united
states
code,
section
922
(a)
(6),
which
prohibits
the
making
of
a
false
statement
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
a
firearm
from
a
licensed
firearms
dealer.
the
basic
problem
in
this
case
arises
from
the
simple
fact
that
section
922
(a)
(6)
prohibits
false
statements
only
if
they
are
made
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
a
firearm.
however,
mr.
huddleston's
statements
were
made
in
connection
with
the
redemption
from
pawn
of
three
rifles
which
he
himself
had
previously
pawned
at
a
pawnshop
some
three
or
four
months
earlier.
that
is,
the
statements
were
not
made
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
firearms
by
mr.
huddleston,
but
rather
in
connection
with
redeeming
property
which
he
himself
had
brought
to
the
pawnshop.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
term
acquisition
was
a
term
used
by
congress
to
catch
basically
sales,
it
is
quite
basically
the
sales.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
now,
we
believe
that
first
of
all,
the
use
in
other
sections
of
the
laws
of
broader
terminology,
such
as
deliver,
would
indicate
that
the
term
acquisition
has
a
narrower
meaning
and
is
simply
physical
transfer.
furthermore,
we
believe
that
congress
may
well
have
been
concerned
with
trades
or
barters
which
were
not
technically
sales.
and
that
the
term
acquisition
must
have
had
a
narrower
meaning
than
simply
physical
transfer,
or
they
would
have
used
the
broader
terminology
that
is
used
in
other
sections,
such
as
simply
transfer
or
deliver.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
section
9
the
--
well,
the
pawnbrokers
required
to
keep
records
as
promulgated
by
the
department
of
the
treasury,
and
the
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
there
is
not
--
the
government
contends
that
it
is
not
restricted
to
sales
that
it
includes
dispositions
of
firearms.
we
do
not
concede
that
it
does
include
dispositions
of
firearms
by
the
pawn
redemption
method.
the
government
seems
to
be
contending
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
true.
they
could
have
said
sale
--
they
could
have
said
sales
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
they
may
well
had
meant
more
than
sales
such
as
a
swap
or
a
trade,
a
barter
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes,
there
was
some
testimony
in
one
of
the
hearings
before
the
--
one
of
the
senate
committees
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes,
mr.
bennett
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes.
mr.
bennett
testified
that
people
go
in
and
they
trade
items,
such
as
a
watch
for
a
gun.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
it's
our
contention
that
they
could
have
said
--
it's
true
that
they
could
have
said
a
lot
of
things
that
the
government
contends
is
contained
in
various
other
sections.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
they
could
have
said
transfer
which
is
used.
they
could
have
said
deliver
which
is
used
in
other
sections.
they
could
have
said
ship
which
is
used
in
other
sections,
but
for
some
reason
they
chose
acquisition.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
right.
i
think
our
main
point
is
that
the
term
acquisition
is
not
all
inclusive.
that
is,
it
has
some
line
to
be
drawn.
we
would
draw
it
narrowly
at
sales.
the
government,
i
would
imagine
would
draw
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
take
it
that
it
could
be
gifts
by
a
licensed
dealer.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
[laughter]
no,
i
don't
think
they're
noted
for
giving.
but
the
law
covers
all
of
gun
dealers,
and
i
supposed
that
a
gun
dealer
who
gave
away
guns,
for
example,
in
a
promotional
effort,
free
guns
today,
would
be
required
for
all
the
people
who
came
in
to
get
the
free
guns
to
fill
out
form
4473,
and
that
would
be
included
in
the
law.
now
on
the
other
side,
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
happens
to
this
term
if
it
is
given
the
broadest
possible
meaning,
which
i
take
it
the
government
is
contending
for.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
where
the
line
should
be
drawn
on
the
term
acquisition.
under
the
government's
definition
of
acquisition
which
is
virtually
any
transfer,
i
take
it
that
two
things
would
be
included.
number
one,
if
a
small
loan
company,
gave
a
loan
on
a
non-possessory
lien
on
a
rifle,
it's
very
possible
when
that
costumer,
who
never
gave
up
possession
of
the
gun,
repaid
the
loan
that
the
government
might
consider
that
act
an
acquisition
and
require
the
debtor
when
he
paid
off
his
loan
to
fill
out
a
form
4473,
which
is
the
treasury
form
that
was
used
in
this
case
in
which
the
false
statement
was
made.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
i
--
no,
i
feel
that
the
government's
position
that
it
applies
to
any
transfer
would
lead
the
court
to
that
position.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
it
is
my
contention
that
is
--
to
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
no,
that
is
not
--
i
don't
think
that
is
agreed
your
honor.
is
agreed
that
his
wife
purchased
the
guns.
and
the
court
below,
in
the
district
court
seemed
to
find
that
as
a
result
of
this
being
a
community
property
state,
these
were
prima
facie,
his
guns
as
well
as
her
guns.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
as
a
practical
manner
why
she
didn't
--
type,
personally
know
is
as
--
by
the
fact
that
he's
my
client,
or
as
--
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
he
redeemed
them.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
under
california
state
law,
she
had
no
right
to
redeem
them.
california
state
law
as
i
read
it,
be
--
allows
only
the
pawnor
to
redeem
the
guns,
and
says
nothing
about
anybody
else.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
law,
unless
she
brought
an
action
against
the
pawnshop
on
the
basis
as
person
who
had
pawned
the
gun
had
stolen
it,
or
had
made
an
unauthorized
pawn
of
that
gun.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes.
under
california
law,
after
six
months
the
pawnbroker
can
foreclose
and
sell
the
gun.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
that
would
probably
be
true.
i
don't
want
to
avoid
your
question,
but
under
the
specific
question
you
asked,
which
has
the
california
law,
there
is
a
ten-day
grace
period
under
which
when
you
get
a
notice
you
can
come
in
and
lay
claim
the
gun.
he
can
also
bid
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
right.
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
that
is
true.
that
would
be
a
purchase,
the
gun
would
have
been
foreclosed.
title
would
have
passed
to
the
pawnbroker,
even
though
under
california
law,
he's
--
the
pawnor
is
still
entitled
to
the
surplus
of
the
funds
after
the
sale.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
another
position
which
i
think
that
the
broad
definition
of
acquisition
with
the
--
which
the
government
is
arguing
for
would
take
this
court,
and
that
is
the
bailment,
such
as
a
person
who
had
a
hunting
rifle
and
had
been
hunting,
and
the
hunting
season
was
over
and
took
it
into
a
retail
gun
store,
and
placed
it
there
and
said,
"would
you
please
keep
this
for
the
non-hunting
season.
i
don't
like
it
around
the
house."
i
take
it
that
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
word
acquisition,
when
he
came
back
to
pick
up
that
rifle,
after
it
had
been
stored,
the
debt
would
also
be
an
acquisition
and
a
form
4473
would
be
required
and
the
person
who
is
picking
up
the
gun
would
be
liable
for
any
false
statements
on
the
form
4473.
as
your
honors
are
aware,
the
question
which
is
at
issue
here
that
is
the
scope
of
the
term
acquisition
has
caused
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
this
question.
the
ninth
and
tenth
circuits
have
agreed
with
the
government's
position
that
a
pawn
redemption
is
included.
the
fifth
circuit
has
adopted
the
petitions
contention
that
a
pawn
redemption
is
not
included
within
the
term
acquisition,
and
i
would
briefly
like
to
give
the
two
primary
reasons
we
believe
that
the
term
should
exclude
pawn
redemptions.
first
of
all,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
term
acquisition
in
section
922
(a)
(6)
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
repossessions
such
as
a
pawn
redemption,
but
it
was
limited
to
sales
or
other
such
transfers
which
resulted
in
a
--
putting
a
new
gun
into
new
hands.
that
is
a
net
increase
in
the
private
ownership
of
guns.
there
were
already
sufficient
laws
on
the
books,
by
virtue
of
the
illegal
possession
laws,
which
gave
congress
control
over
illegal
possessions.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
the
government
--
i
think
that
the
law
did
indicate
that
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
felons
did
not
acquire
new
guns.
if
felons
did
not
acquire
guns
they
didn't
previously
have.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
various
regulatory
measures
that
were
put
in
the
1968
law
were
toward
that
end.
the
illegal
possession
statute
which
was
already
on
the
books
and
the
receipt
statutes
were
nearly
(inaudible)
a
little.
those
were
before
this
court,
united
states
versus
bass.
the
--
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
congress
did
not
require
registration
of
firearms
in
order
to
require
certain
classes
of
persons
to
register
their
ownership
with
firearms.
and
for
that
reason
congress
did
not
require
certain
classes
of
persons
to
register
their
guns,
rather
they
simply
put
a
lid
on
new
sales
by
virtue
of
these
various
regulatory
measures
of
licensing
federal
firearms
dealers
in
requiring
new
acquisitions
to
be
recorded.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
believe
that
our
interpretation
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
it
was
purchased
by
the
wife
with
what
we
concede
--
what
we
contend
is
prima
facie
community
property
money
in
california,
and
therefore
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
the
family
meaning
he
and
his
wife,
not
their
son
as
well.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
would
be
our
contention.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
as
a
practical
matter,
why
didn't
she
redeem
it,
again
i
hate
to
go
off
the
record
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
as
i
was
going
to
say,
i
didn't
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
correct.
i
mean
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
is
a
--
as
a
ma
--
as
a
point
of
fact,
i'm
not
sure
whether
she
testified
to
it
at
trial,
but
she
was
--
a
severe
heart
attack
and
could
hardly
get
out
of
the
car,
and
that
was
the
reason
he
pawned
them
in
the
first
place.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
you're
right,
i
don't
think
as
a
matter
of
the
national
testimony
in
trial
that
it
was
testified
to
that
she
was
still
under
treatment
and
couldn't
redeem
the
gun.
even
though,
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
under
california
law
her
right
of
redemption
since
she
was
not
the
pawnor.
she
might
have
that
gun
--
had
the
gun
through
a
procedure
by
which
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
right.
he
is
the
pawnor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
correct.
and
under
california
law
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
which
she
brought
at
her
name?
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
it
is
correct
as
she
bought
--
again
this
is
a
--
this
is
an
opening
statement
which
i
gave.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
correct.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is,
so
i
say,
i
am
not
exactly
sure
of
the
exact
import
of
that.
that
was
an
opening
statement.
she
--
it
was
clearly
brought
out
in
the
testimony
that
she
bought
the
guns.
the
like
--
the
record
was
left
at
that
with
the
court's
indication
that
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
he
had
pawned
the
guns
and
that
they
were
married,
under
california
law
they
were
both
co-owners
of
the
gun.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
but
he
--
what
him
--
well,
i
--
it's
a
long
--
it's
--
it
was
a
short
story,
basically
we
were
faced
with
a
situation,
and
this
is
how
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
judge
real.
basically
what
happened,
i
was
the
trial
attorney.
basically
what
happened
is
the
justice
department
was
trying
to
create
a
lack
of
conflict
in
the
circuits
by
contending
that
this
case
was
different
in
the
laisure
case.
the
trial
judge
indicated
that
very
early
in
the
game
in
the
trial
that
we
were
probably
going
to
lose
and
that
the
best
thing
that
we
ought
to
do
is
to
make
sure
we
had
an
appealable
issue.
and
therefore,
as
he
states
on
page
29
of
the
appendix,
"mr.
saferstein,
you're
in
a
good
shape
right
now
because
the
pawn
ticket
is
in
mr.
huddleston's
name,
and
that
puts
you
right
smack-dab
in
laisure."
what
he
meant
by
all
that
was
that
the
government
was
trying
to
distinguish
laisure
by
saying
that
in
laisure,
it
was
the
owner
who
had
pawned
the
gun,
whereas
in
our
case
it
was
an
agent
of
the
owner.
and
he
basically
said,
"mr.
saferstein,
i
don't
want
to
try
your
case
for
you,
but
you're
in
as
good
as
shape
as
you
are
right
now,
and
i
wouldn't
proceed
any
further,
we're
trying
to
show
whose
guns
they
were."
so
the
testimony
that
did
come
out
was
simply
that
mr.
huddleston
pawned
the
guns,
and
the
government
only
brought
out
the
simple
question
that
mrs.
huddleston
had
bought
the
guns.
and
under
california
law
in
a
community
property
state,
the
presumption
would
still
be
that
they
were
co-owned.
so
--
and
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
same
arguments
about
the
distinction
between
who
owned
the
gun,
and
whether
this
was
under
laisure
or
not
under
the
laisure
case
were
discussed
in
the
ninth
circuit
except
the
position
that
they
were
co-owners
of
the
guns.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
let
me
say
this
your
honor
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
agreed
fully
with
that
statement.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
except
for
one
thing,
there
are
certain
states
where
pawnshops
are
defined
as
both
people
who
lend
money
and
people
who
buy
guns
and
agreed
to
resell
them
at
a
stipulated
price.
they
try
to
avoid
the
pawn
laws
and
the
usury
interest
rates
by
going
to
a
buy
and
sell.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
if
this
was
a
legitimate
sale.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
correct.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
our
position.
that
this
is
simply
as
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
it
never
was
a
sale.
in
that
--
well
--
and
even
furthermore,
there
never
was
an
acquisition.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
period
during
which
the
gun
is
under
in
pawn,
when
there
is
a
redemption
is
merely
an
interruption
in
the
continued
possession
of
ownership
by
the
pawnor.
and
yet
the
ultimate
effect
of
all
this
it's
a
simply
a
return
to
the
status
quo
at
the
end
of
the
pawn
period,
when
he
takes
back
the
gun
into
his
possession.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
mean
exactly
new
guns,
i
mean
it
could
be
used
guns,
but
putting
guns
into
congress,
and
i
think
that
congress
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
guns
into
the
hands
of
new
people.
i'm
misphrasing
myself.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
transfer
--
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
pawnbrokers
were
included
in
the
law
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
testimony
of
mr.
bennett
before
the
house
showed
that
there
were
a
number
of
purchases
by
the
people
from
pawnbrokers,
especially
the
kind
of
purchase
that
mr.
justice
stewart
talked
about,
that
is
the
swap,
and
they
were
also
concerned
i
believe
that
pawnbrokers
were
often
in
parts
of
the
community
that
had
high
crime
rates.
and
so
i
think
they
were
concerned
with
making
sure
that,
number
one,
they
were
licensed.
they
wanted
them
to
be
licensed.
and
number
two,
that
their
sales
of
guns.
every
one
of
the
congressman
and
every
one
of
the
senators
who
talk
about
pawnbrokers,
talks
about
their
sales.
they
talk
about
windows
and
displays
of
guns
in
their
windows,
whereupon
a
pawnbroker
does
not
display
in
his
windows
the
guns
that
he
is
keeping
in
the
safekeeping
for
the
pawnor.
so
i
think
they
included
them
to
include
their
sales,
and
they
were
fearful
in
light
of
the
testimony
in
mr.
cone,
and
the
unique
nature
of
the
pawnbrokers
business
that
they
would
not
be
included
within
the
definition
of
a
retail
seller
of
guns
at
retail
or
wholesale.
and
so
i
think
that
is
an
explanation.
furthermore,
they
may
have
been
simply
concerned
with
making
sure
they
were
regulated
in
the
entirety.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
right
and
mr.
cone,
the
president
of
the
pawnbrokers
association
of
new
york,
when
testifying
on
this
legislature,
made
it
quite
clear
that
that's
what
he
thought,
that
they
weren't
dealers,
and
they
didn't
consider
themselves
dealers
under
the
law.
and
i
think
for
that
reason,
congress
went
out
of
its
way
to
include
pawnbrokers
as
a
separate
category.
now
i
think
the
primary
legislative
history,
apart
from
the
debates
which
supports
our
position
is
the
code
section
cited
on
page
13
of
our
brief,
section
922
(a)
(2).
this
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
68
law,
922
(a)
(2).
it's
this
section
which
prohibits
any
interstate
shipment
by
a
firearms
dealer
to
anyone.
it
simply
outlaws
it,
and
this
was
--
the
whole
purpose
of
this
was
to
bring
the
whole
gun
transactions
into
licensed
dealers,
into
transactions
between
licensed
dealers.
yet
despite
the
importance
of
this
basic
prohibition
in
the
gun
control
law,
congress
exempted
from
that
in
their
subparagraph
(a),
they
state,
"this
paragraph
in
subsection
(b)
(3)
shall
not
held
--
be
held
to
preclude
a
licensed
dealer
from
returning
a
firearm
to
a
person
from
whom
it
was
received."
in
other
words,
despite
the
crucial
importance
of
this
section,
congress
exempted
the
type
of
repossession
that
we
have
in
this
case,
that
is
the
return
of
the
gun
to
the
person
who
deposited
it
with
that
licensed
firearm
dealer.
our
second
basic
argument
in
the
alternative
is
that
the
statutory
language
is
so
ambiguous
that,
and
raises
such
serious
constitutional
questions
that
the
statute
should
be
narrowly
construed
in
light
of
the
statutory
construction
rules
cited
by
this
court,
the
united
states
versus
bass,
when
dealing
with
another
title
of
the
same
1968
gun
law.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i've
--
i
read
laisure
as
saying
there's
an
ambiguity
because
acquisition
to
the
court
in
laisure
seemed
to
be
a
narrow
term
which
they
did
not
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
the
ambiguity,
i
take
it
in
laisure
was
by
the
fact
that
in
the
first
part
of
922
(a)
(6),
they
talked
about
acquisition,
and
the
second
part
they
talked
about
sale
or
other
disposition.
and
they
have
thought
that
it
was
ambiguous
or
other
disposition
might
be
broader
than
acquisition.
there
they
found
the
ambiguity.
i
must
say
i
find
the
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
that
the
argument
that
i
would
adopt
is
that
the
term
acquisition
by
itself
is
ambiguous.
it
was
--
it's
not
defined,
in
fact
there
are
something
like
--
i
think
12
to
15
terms
used
in
this
law
to
define
the
transfer
of
firearm.
and
not
one
of
these
is
defined
anywhere
in
the
lengthy
list
of
definitions.
and
so
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
no,
i
think,
in
light
of
the
light
--
i
think
in
light
of
the
context
of
the
statute
and
that
fact
that
it
talks
about
sale,
which
is
certainly
not
simply
coming
into
possession
in
light
of
the
statutory
purpose,
in
the
light
of
section
922
(a)
(2)
(a),
that
that
is
an
ambiguous
term.
it
has
a
whole
spectrum
of
meanings.
the
government
argues
for
a
very
broad
one,
we
think
that
it
is
a
very
narrow
one,
and
that
it
does
not
apply
simply
to
any
--
coming
in
to
possession.
i
don't
think
it
applies
to,
for
instance,
the
simple
person
who
comes
and
brings
his
gun
in
for
a
day
and
says,
"please
keep
it."
and
when
he
goes
out
he
has
to
fill
out
a
form
4473
and
he
is
liable
for
any
false
statements,
and
subjects
to
imprisonment
for
a
maximum
of
five
years.
and
i
would
like
to
save
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
answer
the
argument
of
counsel
that
the
pawnbrokers
were
included
because
of
the
worry
of
the
swaps
not
being
included.
i
don't
think
that
was
the
problem.
i
think
they
were
worried
that
their
business
which
is
primarily
lending
was
not
included,
and
that
they
were
not
in
the
business
of
selling
guns
at
wholesale
or
retail,
and
particularly
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
the
foreclosure
sales.
as
to
the
question
of
their
--
of
the
record
keeping
requirement
for
other
dispositions
and
somehow
knocking
a
hole
in
that,
again
the
hole
is
not
knocked
in
so
far
as
there
are
any
records.
they
don't
--
the
only
hole
that
would
be
knocked
is
the
question
of
whether
mr.
huddleston
would
be
criminally
liable
for
any
statements
made.
and
the
government
has
argued
and
has
proceeded
against
people
under
section
924
(a)
with
the
same
type
of
transaction
that
mr.
huddleston
engaged
in,
on
a
grounds
that
was
a
false
statement
on
a
record
required
to
be
kept.
finally,
i
think
that
the
point
of
the
gun
control
law
was
to
focus
on
the
dispositions
by
dealers,
to
regulate
dealers,
and
in
so
far
as
people
who
were
not
supposed
to
have
guns.
they
were
relying
on
the
illegal
possession
statute.
and
this
case,
because
of
the
pawn
records
that
are
kept
by
virtue
of
state
laws,
by
federal
laws,
by
the
truth
and
lending
laws,
mr.
huddleston's
transaction
was
an
open,
public
transaction.
his
possession
was
a
matter
of
record,
and
if
the
agent,
who
goes
around
to
the
pawnshops
and
checks
the
records,
would've
checked
his
police
reports,
he
could've
simply
brought
an
illegal
possession
case
against
mr.
huddleston.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
in
that
case
you
will
be
required
to
fill
out
form
4473,
yes.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
no,
i
am
saying
that
the
pawn
isn't
open.
i
mean
he
openly
recognizes,
i
own,
i
possess
this
gun,
he
puts
it
into
the
hands
of
a
federal
licensed
firearm
dealer.
the
record
is
there
for
everyone
to
see.
the
police
come
through
and
check
it.
the
treasury
department
officials
come
through
and
check
it.
they
run
it
through
sacramento
or
the
fbi,
and
they
say,
this
fellow
is
a
felon.
in
this
case,
the
felony
was
six
years
previously.
he
had
pleaded
guilty
to
writing
checks
without
sufficient
funds.
the
question
is
whether
that
is
a
felony.
technically,
it
is
a
felony
under
california
law
even
though
he
was
sentenced
to
only
30
days
in
prison.
but
during
the
period
that
that
was
in
pawn,
he
makes
an
open
public
statement,
"so
here
i
am
and
the
government
has
the
--
all
the
records."
in
fact,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
under
the
craven
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
they
probably
could
prosecute
him
for
illegal
possession
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
he
pawned
the
guns.
and
he
filled
out
his
name
and
wrote,
and
said,
"i
accept
the
money
for
the
gun
that
i
am
giving
you."
the
gun
is
spelled
out
in
the
records.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
legitimate
enforcement
device
of
the
government
that
we
are
knocking
out
by
asking
for
an
honest,
narrow
construction
of
what
we
feel
is
an
ambiguous
statute
that
raises
serious
problems
both
in
terms
of
fairness
to
people,
in
terms
of
property
rights.
if
it
is
construed
broadly
and
we
therefore
feel
that
the
principles
of
bass
should
be
applied
in
the
term
narrowly
construed.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
it
is
--
that
it
was
never
been
tested,
nor
has
it
ever
been
conceded.
the
question
of
the
illegality
of
mr.
huddleston's
possession
would
require
first
proof
that
he
was
a
convicted
felon.
that
would
probably
be
proven
by
what
was
proven
here.
however,
that
under
the
united
states
versus
bass
decision
of
this
court
in
1971,
an
interstate
commerce
nexus
would
have
to
be
proven.
and
--
honestly
i
think
that
is
what
is
trying
to
be
avoided
by
this
procedure
the
government
uses
here,
because
they
are
trying
to
avoid
the
interstate
commerce
nexus
that
has
to
be
shown
under
this
court's
decision
in
bass.
i
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
conviction
of
william
carol
huddleston
for
violating
title
18,
united
states
code,
section
922
(a)
(6),
which
prohibits
the
making
of
a
false
statement
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
a
firearm
from
a
licensed
firearms
dealer.
the
basic
problem
in
this
case
arises
from
the
simple
fact
that
section
922
(a)
(6)
prohibits
false
statements
only
if
they
are
made
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
a
firearm.
however,
mr.
huddleston's
statements
were
made
in
connection
with
the
redemption
from
pawn
of
three
rifles
which
he
himself
had
previously
pawned
at
a
pawnshop
some
three
or
four
months
earlier.
that
is,
the
statements
were
not
made
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
firearms
by
mr.
huddleston,
but
rather
in
connection
with
redeeming
property
which
he
himself
had
brought
to
the
pawnshop.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
term
acquisition
was
a
term
used
by
congress
to
catch
basically
sales,
it
is
quite
basically
the
sales.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
now,
we
believe
that
first
of
all,
the
use
in
other
sections
of
the
laws
of
broader
terminology,
such
as
deliver,
would
indicate
that
the
term
acquisition
has
a
narrower
meaning
and
is
simply
physical
transfer.
furthermore,
we
believe
that
congress
may
well
have
been
concerned
with
trades
or
barters
which
were
not
technically
sales.
and
that
the
term
acquisition
must
have
had
a
narrower
meaning
than
simply
physical
transfer,
or
they
would
have
used
the
broader
terminology
that
is
used
in
other
sections,
such
as
simply
transfer
or
deliver.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
section
9
the
--
well,
the
pawnbrokers
required
to
keep
records
as
promulgated
by
the
department
of
the
treasury,
and
the
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
there
is
not
--
the
government
contends
that
it
is
not
restricted
to
sales
that
it
includes
dispositions
of
firearms.
we
do
not
concede
that
it
does
include
dispositions
of
firearms
by
the
pawn
redemption
method.
the
government
seems
to
be
contending
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
true.
they
could
have
said
sale
--
they
could
have
said
sales
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
they
may
well
had
meant
more
than
sales
such
as
a
swap
or
a
trade,
a
barter
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes,
there
was
some
testimony
in
one
of
the
hearings
before
the
--
one
of
the
senate
committees
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes,
mr.
bennett
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes.
mr.
bennett
testified
that
people
go
in
and
they
trade
items,
such
as
a
watch
for
a
gun.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
it's
our
contention
that
they
could
have
said
--
it's
true
that
they
could
have
said
a
lot
of
things
that
the
government
contends
is
contained
in
various
other
sections.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
they
could
have
said
transfer
which
is
used.
they
could
have
said
deliver
which
is
used
in
other
sections.
they
could
have
said
ship
which
is
used
in
other
sections,
but
for
some
reason
they
chose
acquisition.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
right.
i
think
our
main
point
is
that
the
term
acquisition
is
not
all
inclusive.
that
is,
it
has
some
line
to
be
drawn.
we
would
draw
it
narrowly
at
sales.
the
government,
i
would
imagine
would
draw
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
take
it
that
it
could
be
gifts
by
a
licensed
dealer.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
[laughter]
no,
i
don't
think
they're
noted
for
giving.
but
the
law
covers
all
of
gun
dealers,
and
i
supposed
that
a
gun
dealer
who
gave
away
guns,
for
example,
in
a
promotional
effort,
free
guns
today,
would
be
required
for
all
the
people
who
came
in
to
get
the
free
guns
to
fill
out
form
4473,
and
that
would
be
included
in
the
law.
now
on
the
other
side,
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
happens
to
this
term
if
it
is
given
the
broadest
possible
meaning,
which
i
take
it
the
government
is
contending
for.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
where
the
line
should
be
drawn
on
the
term
acquisition.
under
the
government's
definition
of
acquisition
which
is
virtually
any
transfer,
i
take
it
that
two
things
would
be
included.
number
one,
if
a
small
loan
company,
gave
a
loan
on
a
non-possessory
lien
on
a
rifle,
it's
very
possible
when
that
costumer,
who
never
gave
up
possession
of
the
gun,
repaid
the
loan
that
the
government
might
consider
that
act
an
acquisition
and
require
the
debtor
when
he
paid
off
his
loan
to
fill
out
a
form
4473,
which
is
the
treasury
form
that
was
used
in
this
case
in
which
the
false
statement
was
made.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
i
--
no,
i
feel
that
the
government's
position
that
it
applies
to
any
transfer
would
lead
the
court
to
that
position.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
it
is
my
contention
that
is
--
to
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
no,
that
is
not
--
i
don't
think
that
is
agreed
your
honor.
is
agreed
that
his
wife
purchased
the
guns.
and
the
court
below,
in
the
district
court
seemed
to
find
that
as
a
result
of
this
being
a
community
property
state,
these
were
prima
facie,
his
guns
as
well
as
her
guns.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
as
a
practical
manner
why
she
didn't
--
type,
personally
know
is
as
--
by
the
fact
that
he's
my
client,
or
as
--
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
he
redeemed
them.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
under
california
state
law,
she
had
no
right
to
redeem
them.
california
state
law
as
i
read
it,
be
--
allows
only
the
pawnor
to
redeem
the
guns,
and
says
nothing
about
anybody
else.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
law,
unless
she
brought
an
action
against
the
pawnshop
on
the
basis
as
person
who
had
pawned
the
gun
had
stolen
it,
or
had
made
an
unauthorized
pawn
of
that
gun.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes.
under
california
law,
after
six
months
the
pawnbroker
can
foreclose
and
sell
the
gun.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
that
would
probably
be
true.
i
don't
want
to
avoid
your
question,
but
under
the
specific
question
you
asked,
which
has
the
california
law,
there
is
a
ten-day
grace
period
under
which
when
you
get
a
notice
you
can
come
in
and
lay
claim
the
gun.
he
can
also
bid
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
right.
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
that
is
true.
that
would
be
a
purchase,
the
gun
would
have
been
foreclosed.
title
would
have
passed
to
the
pawnbroker,
even
though
under
california
law,
he's
--
the
pawnor
is
still
entitled
to
the
surplus
of
the
funds
after
the
sale.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
another
position
which
i
think
that
the
broad
definition
of
acquisition
with
the
--
which
the
government
is
arguing
for
would
take
this
court,
and
that
is
the
bailment,
such
as
a
person
who
had
a
hunting
rifle
and
had
been
hunting,
and
the
hunting
season
was
over
and
took
it
into
a
retail
gun
store,
and
placed
it
there
and
said,
"would
you
please
keep
this
for
the
non-hunting
season.
i
don't
like
it
around
the
house."
i
take
it
that
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
word
acquisition,
when
he
came
back
to
pick
up
that
rifle,
after
it
had
been
stored,
the
debt
would
also
be
an
acquisition
and
a
form
4473
would
be
required
and
the
person
who
is
picking
up
the
gun
would
be
liable
for
any
false
statements
on
the
form
4473.
as
your
honors
are
aware,
the
question
which
is
at
issue
here
that
is
the
scope
of
the
term
acquisition
has
caused
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
this
question.
the
ninth
and
tenth
circuits
have
agreed
with
the
government's
position
that
a
pawn
redemption
is
included.
the
fifth
circuit
has
adopted
the
petitions
contention
that
a
pawn
redemption
is
not
included
within
the
term
acquisition,
and
i
would
briefly
like
to
give
the
two
primary
reasons
we
believe
that
the
term
should
exclude
pawn
redemptions.
first
of
all,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
term
acquisition
in
section
922
(a)
(6)
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
repossessions
such
as
a
pawn
redemption,
but
it
was
limited
to
sales
or
other
such
transfers
which
resulted
in
a
--
putting
a
new
gun
into
new
hands.
that
is
a
net
increase
in
the
private
ownership
of
guns.
there
were
already
sufficient
laws
on
the
books,
by
virtue
of
the
illegal
possession
laws,
which
gave
congress
control
over
illegal
possessions.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
the
government
--
i
think
that
the
law
did
indicate
that
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
felons
did
not
acquire
new
guns.
if
felons
did
not
acquire
guns
they
didn't
previously
have.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
various
regulatory
measures
that
were
put
in
the
1968
law
were
toward
that
end.
the
illegal
possession
statute
which
was
already
on
the
books
and
the
receipt
statutes
were
nearly
(inaudible)
a
little.
those
were
before
this
court,
united
states
versus
bass.
the
--
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
congress
did
not
require
registration
of
firearms
in
order
to
require
certain
classes
of
persons
to
register
their
ownership
with
firearms.
and
for
that
reason
congress
did
not
require
certain
classes
of
persons
to
register
their
guns,
rather
they
simply
put
a
lid
on
new
sales
by
virtue
of
these
various
regulatory
measures
of
licensing
federal
firearms
dealers
in
requiring
new
acquisitions
to
be
recorded.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
believe
that
our
interpretation
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
it
was
purchased
by
the
wife
with
what
we
concede
--
what
we
contend
is
prima
facie
community
property
money
in
california,
and
therefore
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
the
family
meaning
he
and
his
wife,
not
their
son
as
well.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
would
be
our
contention.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
as
a
practical
matter,
why
didn't
she
redeem
it,
again
i
hate
to
go
off
the
record
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
as
i
was
going
to
say,
i
didn't
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
correct.
i
mean
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
is
a
--
as
a
ma
--
as
a
point
of
fact,
i'm
not
sure
whether
she
testified
to
it
at
trial,
but
she
was
--
a
severe
heart
attack
and
could
hardly
get
out
of
the
car,
and
that
was
the
reason
he
pawned
them
in
the
first
place.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
you're
right,
i
don't
think
as
a
matter
of
the
national
testimony
in
trial
that
it
was
testified
to
that
she
was
still
under
treatment
and
couldn't
redeem
the
gun.
even
though,
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
under
california
law
her
right
of
redemption
since
she
was
not
the
pawnor.
she
might
have
that
gun
--
had
the
gun
through
a
procedure
by
which
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
right.
he
is
the
pawnor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
correct.
and
under
california
law
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
which
she
brought
at
her
name?
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
it
is
correct
as
she
bought
--
again
this
is
a
--
this
is
an
opening
statement
which
i
gave.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
correct.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is,
so
i
say,
i
am
not
exactly
sure
of
the
exact
import
of
that.
that
was
an
opening
statement.
she
--
it
was
clearly
brought
out
in
the
testimony
that
she
bought
the
guns.
the
like
--
the
record
was
left
at
that
with
the
court's
indication
that
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
he
had
pawned
the
guns
and
that
they
were
married,
under
california
law
they
were
both
co-owners
of
the
gun.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
but
he
--
what
him
--
well,
i
--
it's
a
long
--
it's
--
it
was
a
short
story,
basically
we
were
faced
with
a
situation,
and
this
is
how
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
judge
real.
basically
what
happened,
i
was
the
trial
attorney.
basically
what
happened
is
the
justice
department
was
trying
to
create
a
lack
of
conflict
in
the
circuits
by
contending
that
this
case
was
different
in
the
laisure
case.
the
trial
judge
indicated
that
very
early
in
the
game
in
the
trial
that
we
were
probably
going
to
lose
and
that
the
best
thing
that
we
ought
to
do
is
to
make
sure
we
had
an
appealable
issue.
and
therefore,
as
he
states
on
page
29
of
the
appendix,
"mr.
saferstein,
you're
in
a
good
shape
right
now
because
the
pawn
ticket
is
in
mr.
huddleston's
name,
and
that
puts
you
right
smack-dab
in
laisure."
what
he
meant
by
all
that
was
that
the
government
was
trying
to
distinguish
laisure
by
saying
that
in
laisure,
it
was
the
owner
who
had
pawned
the
gun,
whereas
in
our
case
it
was
an
agent
of
the
owner.
and
he
basically
said,
"mr.
saferstein,
i
don't
want
to
try
your
case
for
you,
but
you're
in
as
good
as
shape
as
you
are
right
now,
and
i
wouldn't
proceed
any
further,
we're
trying
to
show
whose
guns
they
were."
so
the
testimony
that
did
come
out
was
simply
that
mr.
huddleston
pawned
the
guns,
and
the
government
only
brought
out
the
simple
question
that
mrs.
huddleston
had
bought
the
guns.
and
under
california
law
in
a
community
property
state,
the
presumption
would
still
be
that
they
were
co-owned.
so
--
and
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
same
arguments
about
the
distinction
between
who
owned
the
gun,
and
whether
this
was
under
laisure
or
not
under
the
laisure
case
were
discussed
in
the
ninth
circuit
except
the
position
that
they
were
co-owners
of
the
guns.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
let
me
say
this
your
honor
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
agreed
fully
with
that
statement.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
except
for
one
thing,
there
are
certain
states
where
pawnshops
are
defined
as
both
people
who
lend
money
and
people
who
buy
guns
and
agreed
to
resell
them
at
a
stipulated
price.
they
try
to
avoid
the
pawn
laws
and
the
usury
interest
rates
by
going
to
a
buy
and
sell.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
if
this
was
a
legitimate
sale.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
correct.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
that
is
our
position.
that
this
is
simply
as
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
it
never
was
a
sale.
in
that
--
well
--
and
even
furthermore,
there
never
was
an
acquisition.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
period
during
which
the
gun
is
under
in
pawn,
when
there
is
a
redemption
is
merely
an
interruption
in
the
continued
possession
of
ownership
by
the
pawnor.
and
yet
the
ultimate
effect
of
all
this
it's
a
simply
a
return
to
the
status
quo
at
the
end
of
the
pawn
period,
when
he
takes
back
the
gun
into
his
possession.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
mean
exactly
new
guns,
i
mean
it
could
be
used
guns,
but
putting
guns
into
congress,
and
i
think
that
congress
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
guns
into
the
hands
of
new
people.
i'm
misphrasing
myself.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
transfer
--
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
pawnbrokers
were
included
in
the
law
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
testimony
of
mr.
bennett
before
the
house
showed
that
there
were
a
number
of
purchases
by
the
people
from
pawnbrokers,
especially
the
kind
of
purchase
that
mr.
justice
stewart
talked
about,
that
is
the
swap,
and
they
were
also
concerned
i
believe
that
pawnbrokers
were
often
in
parts
of
the
community
that
had
high
crime
rates.
and
so
i
think
they
were
concerned
with
making
sure
that,
number
one,
they
were
licensed.
they
wanted
them
to
be
licensed.
and
number
two,
that
their
sales
of
guns.
every
one
of
the
congressman
and
every
one
of
the
senators
who
talk
about
pawnbrokers,
talks
about
their
sales.
they
talk
about
windows
and
displays
of
guns
in
their
windows,
whereupon
a
pawnbroker
does
not
display
in
his
windows
the
guns
that
he
is
keeping
in
the
safekeeping
for
the
pawnor.
so
i
think
they
included
them
to
include
their
sales,
and
they
were
fearful
in
light
of
the
testimony
in
mr.
cone,
and
the
unique
nature
of
the
pawnbrokers
business
that
they
would
not
be
included
within
the
definition
of
a
retail
seller
of
guns
at
retail
or
wholesale.
and
so
i
think
that
is
an
explanation.
furthermore,
they
may
have
been
simply
concerned
with
making
sure
they
were
regulated
in
the
entirety.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
right
and
mr.
cone,
the
president
of
the
pawnbrokers
association
of
new
york,
when
testifying
on
this
legislature,
made
it
quite
clear
that
that's
what
he
thought,
that
they
weren't
dealers,
and
they
didn't
consider
themselves
dealers
under
the
law.
and
i
think
for
that
reason,
congress
went
out
of
its
way
to
include
pawnbrokers
as
a
separate
category.
now
i
think
the
primary
legislative
history,
apart
from
the
debates
which
supports
our
position
is
the
code
section
cited
on
page
13
of
our
brief,
section
922
(a)
(2).
this
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
68
law,
922
(a)
(2).
it's
this
section
which
prohibits
any
interstate
shipment
by
a
firearms
dealer
to
anyone.
it
simply
outlaws
it,
and
this
was
--
the
whole
purpose
of
this
was
to
bring
the
whole
gun
transactions
into
licensed
dealers,
into
transactions
between
licensed
dealers.
yet
despite
the
importance
of
this
basic
prohibition
in
the
gun
control
law,
congress
exempted
from
that
in
their
subparagraph
(a),
they
state,
"this
paragraph
in
subsection
(b)
(3)
shall
not
held
--
be
held
to
preclude
a
licensed
dealer
from
returning
a
firearm
to
a
person
from
whom
it
was
received."
in
other
words,
despite
the
crucial
importance
of
this
section,
congress
exempted
the
type
of
repossession
that
we
have
in
this
case,
that
is
the
return
of
the
gun
to
the
person
who
deposited
it
with
that
licensed
firearm
dealer.
our
second
basic
argument
in
the
alternative
is
that
the
statutory
language
is
so
ambiguous
that,
and
raises
such
serious
constitutional
questions
that
the
statute
should
be
narrowly
construed
in
light
of
the
statutory
construction
rules
cited
by
this
court,
the
united
states
versus
bass,
when
dealing
with
another
title
of
the
same
1968
gun
law.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i've
--
i
read
laisure
as
saying
there's
an
ambiguity
because
acquisition
to
the
court
in
laisure
seemed
to
be
a
narrow
term
which
they
did
not
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
the
ambiguity,
i
take
it
in
laisure
was
by
the
fact
that
in
the
first
part
of
922
(a)
(6),
they
talked
about
acquisition,
and
the
second
part
they
talked
about
sale
or
other
disposition.
and
they
have
thought
that
it
was
ambiguous
or
other
disposition
might
be
broader
than
acquisition.
there
they
found
the
ambiguity.
i
must
say
i
find
the
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
i
think
that
the
argument
that
i
would
adopt
is
that
the
term
acquisition
by
itself
is
ambiguous.
it
was
--
it's
not
defined,
in
fact
there
are
something
like
--
i
think
12
to
15
terms
used
in
this
law
to
define
the
transfer
of
firearm.
and
not
one
of
these
is
defined
anywhere
in
the
lengthy
list
of
definitions.
and
so
--
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
no,
i
think,
in
light
of
the
light
--
i
think
in
light
of
the
context
of
the
statute
and
that
fact
that
it
talks
about
sale,
which
is
certainly
not
simply
coming
into
possession
in
light
of
the
statutory
purpose,
in
the
light
of
section
922
(a)
(2)
(a),
that
that
is
an
ambiguous
term.
it
has
a
whole
spectrum
of
meanings.
the
government
argues
for
a
very
broad
one,
we
think
that
it
is
a
very
narrow
one,
and
that
it
does
not
apply
simply
to
any
--
coming
in
to
possession.
i
don't
think
it
applies
to,
for
instance,
the
simple
person
who
comes
and
brings
his
gun
in
for
a
day
and
says,
"please
keep
it."
and
when
he
goes
out
he
has
to
fill
out
a
form
4473
and
he
is
liable
for
any
false
statements,
and
subjects
to
imprisonment
for
a
maximum
of
five
years.
and
i
would
like
to
save
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
answer
the
argument
of
counsel
that
the
pawnbrokers
were
included
because
of
the
worry
of
the
swaps
not
being
included.
i
don't
think
that
was
the
problem.
i
think
they
were
worried
that
their
business
which
is
primarily
lending
was
not
included,
and
that
they
were
not
in
the
business
of
selling
guns
at
wholesale
or
retail,
and
particularly
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
the
foreclosure
sales.
as
to
the
question
of
their
--
of
the
record
keeping
requirement
for
other
dispositions
and
somehow
knocking
a
hole
in
that,
again
the
hole
is
not
knocked
in
so
far
as
there
are
any
records.
they
don't
--
the
only
hole
that
would
be
knocked
is
the
question
of
whether
mr.
huddleston
would
be
criminally
liable
for
any
statements
made.
and
the
government
has
argued
and
has
proceeded
against
people
under
section
924
(a)
with
the
same
type
of
transaction
that
mr.
huddleston
engaged
in,
on
a
grounds
that
was
a
false
statement
on
a
record
required
to
be
kept.
finally,
i
think
that
the
point
of
the
gun
control
law
was
to
focus
on
the
dispositions
by
dealers,
to
regulate
dealers,
and
in
so
far
as
people
who
were
not
supposed
to
have
guns.
they
were
relying
on
the
illegal
possession
statute.
and
this
case,
because
of
the
pawn
records
that
are
kept
by
virtue
of
state
laws,
by
federal
laws,
by
the
truth
and
lending
laws,
mr.
huddleston's
transaction
was
an
open,
public
transaction.
his
possession
was
a
matter
of
record,
and
if
the
agent,
who
goes
around
to
the
pawnshops
and
checks
the
records,
would've
checked
his
police
reports,
he
could've
simply
brought
an
illegal
possession
case
against
mr.
huddleston.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
in
that
case
you
will
be
required
to
fill
out
form
4473,
yes.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
no,
i
am
saying
that
the
pawn
isn't
open.
i
mean
he
openly
recognizes,
i
own,
i
possess
this
gun,
he
puts
it
into
the
hands
of
a
federal
licensed
firearm
dealer.
the
record
is
there
for
everyone
to
see.
the
police
come
through
and
check
it.
the
treasury
department
officials
come
through
and
check
it.
they
run
it
through
sacramento
or
the
fbi,
and
they
say,
this
fellow
is
a
felon.
in
this
case,
the
felony
was
six
years
previously.
he
had
pleaded
guilty
to
writing
checks
without
sufficient
funds.
the
question
is
whether
that
is
a
felony.
technically,
it
is
a
felony
under
california
law
even
though
he
was
sentenced
to
only
30
days
in
prison.
but
during
the
period
that
that
was
in
pawn,
he
makes
an
open
public
statement,
"so
here
i
am
and
the
government
has
the
--
all
the
records."
in
fact,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
under
the
craven
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
they
probably
could
prosecute
him
for
illegal
possession
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
he
pawned
the
guns.
and
he
filled
out
his
name
and
wrote,
and
said,
"i
accept
the
money
for
the
gun
that
i
am
giving
you."
the
gun
is
spelled
out
in
the
records.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
legitimate
enforcement
device
of
the
government
that
we
are
knocking
out
by
asking
for
an
honest,
narrow
construction
of
what
we
feel
is
an
ambiguous
statute
that
raises
serious
problems
both
in
terms
of
fairness
to
people,
in
terms
of
property
rights.
if
it
is
construed
broadly
and
we
therefore
feel
that
the
principles
of
bass
should
be
applied
in
the
term
narrowly
construed.
mr.
harvey
i.
saferstein
it
is
--
that
it
was
never
been
tested,
nor
has
it
ever
been
conceded.
the
question
of
the
illegality
of
mr.
huddleston's
possession
would
require
first
proof
that
he
was
a
convicted
felon.
that
would
probably
be
proven
by
what
was
proven
here.
however,
that
under
the
united
states
versus
bass
decision
of
this
court
in
1971,
an
interstate
commerce
nexus
would
have
to
be
proven.
and
--
honestly
i
think
that
is
what
is
trying
to
be
avoided
by
this
procedure
the
government
uses
here,
because
they
are
trying
to
avoid
the
interstate
commerce
nexus
that
has
to
be
shown
under
this
court's
decision
in
bass.
i
thank
you.
