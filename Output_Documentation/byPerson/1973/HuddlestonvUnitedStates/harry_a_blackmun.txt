this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
unites
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
presents
the
issue
whether
a
federal
statues
declaring
that
it
is
unlawful
knowingly
to
make
a
false
statement
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
any
fire
arm
from
a
licensed
dealer,
covers
the
redemption
of
a
fire
arm
from
a
pawnshop.
in
1971,
the
practitioner
mr.
huddleston,
pawned
3
riffles
owned
by
his
wife
at
pawnshop
in
california.
the
shop
proprietor
was
a
federally
licensed
firearms
dealer.
some
weeks
later,
mr.
huddleston
redeemed
the
weapons
when
he
did
this
the
pawnbroker
required
him
to
complete
a
treasury
form
used
in
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
gun
control
statues.
a
question
on
that
forms,
specifically
inquired
whether
the
person
executing
it,
had
been
convicted
in
any
court
of
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
one
year.
this
question
is
directed
to
the
prohibition
in
a
statue
against
a
dealer’s
selling
or
otherwise
disposing
of
a
firearm
to
any
person
who
has
been
so
convicted.
mr.
huddleston
answered
no
to
that
question
on
each
of
the
three
forms.
he
then
affixed
his
signature
to
the
certification
that
his
answer
was
true
and
correct.
in
fact,
some
six
years
earlier
he
had
been
convicted
in
a
california
state
court
of
a
crime
punishable
under
state
law
by
a
maximum
term
of
14
years.
in
due
course,
mr.
huddleston
was
charged
in
three
count
indictment
with
violating
the
statue.
he
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
the
statue
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
a
pawnors
redemption
of
a
weapon
he
had
pawned.
this
motion
was
denied.
he
then
pleaded
not
guilty.
he
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced.
the
ninth
circuit,
by
a
divided
vote,
affirmed
the
conviction.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
on
the
issue,
and
in
opinion
filed
today,
we
examine
the
language
and
structure
of
the
act
and
its
legislative
history,
and
we
conclude
that
the
word
acquisition,
as
used
in
the
statued,
does
include
any
person
who
redeems
a
weapon
that
has
been
pawned.
we
do
not
find
the
statued
ambiguous
or
uncertain.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
is
therefore
affirmed.
i
am
authorized
to
state
that
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
from
this
conclusion.
