unknown
speaker
with
james
bennett.
unknown
speaker
james
bennett
testified
before
one
of
the
committees
that
one
of
the
problems
was
people
going
in
and
trading
a
watch
for
a
gun
at
a
pawnshop,
i
think
i
remember
that
in
the
briefs,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
your
point
is
that
whatever
else
acquisition
may
or
may
not
mean,
it
doesn't
mean
the
man
gains
his
own
property
back?
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
gifts,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
by
anybody.
unknown
speaker
but
the
loan
was
beyond
their
repossession,
physical
possession.
unknown
speaker
well
--
unknown
speaker
i
doubt
if
they
go
that
far.
let
me
ask
you
something,
is
it
agreed
that
this
gun
or
guns,
were
not
the
property
of
mr.
huddleston's
but
of
his
wife?
unknown
speaker
he
don't
know
why
as
a
practical
matter
she
didn't
redeem
them?
unknown
speaker
even
though,
if
she
were
the
owner
and
he
had
taken
them
into
the
pawnshop,
only
he
could
redeem
them,
under
the
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
mr.
saferstein,
going
back
to
my
question,
your
--
the
government's
brief
states
that
the
evidence
at
trial
showed
that
petitioner,
your
client
pawned
his
wife's
winchester,
and
then
later
pawned
at
the
same
store
two
other
rifles
belonging
to
his
wife.
in
your
brief
says
that
he
pawned
three
of
his
family's
rifles.
unknown
speaker
which
is
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
do
--
does
the
family
own
it?
unknown
speaker
it
belongs
to
both
of
them?
unknown
speaker
belongs
to
both
of
them.
unknown
speaker
then
i
ask
again
as
a
practical
matter,
why
didn't
she
redeem
those,
then
you
wouldn't
be
here
and
have
a
case,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
the
testimony
at
the
trial,
i'm
reading
it
on
page
28.
she's
suffered
severe
heart
attacks
and
she's
still
not
very
healthy
and
then
that
was
the
reason
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
transactions.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
the
testimony
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
--
alright,
that--
i
--
perhaps
that's
right.
i
guess
it's
your
representation
to
the
trial
judge
if
that
was
the
situation.
unknown
speaker
he
was
the
one
who
went
to
the
pawnshop
and
borrowed
the
money?
unknown
speaker
by
confiscating
the
guns
and
apparently
--
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
ask
where
he
got
the
--
whose
property
the
guns
were?
he
brought
them
there.
unknown
speaker
and
he
was
the
one
who
borrowed
the
money.
on
the
other
hand,
on
page
27,
this
reports
to
be
your
statement
to
the
court.
mrs.
huddleston
owned
three
rifles
which
she
brought
--
bought
in
her
name.
well,
this
is
not
correct
then
i
take?
unknown
speaker
mr.
(voive
overlap).
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
say
mrs.
huddleston
owned
three
rifles,
page
27?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
whether
that
is
incorrect.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
made
at
the
very
next
page
right
after
that
statement
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred
it
to
you.
you
made
the
argument
to
the
trial
judge,
"we
have
a
community
property
state,
your
honor."
and
the
trial
judge
said,
"that
ain't
going
to
help
you."
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
who
was
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
mr.
saferstein,
i
think
you've
said
that
your
interpretation
of
the
legislative
history
leads
you
to
think
that
congress
was
concerned
either
only
or
primarily
with
the
introduction
of
new
guns
and
become
as
--
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
in
light
of
that
that
congress
requires
pawnbrokers
to
register
as
dealers?
unknown
speaker
guns
into
the
hands
of
new
people?
unknown
speaker
the
transfer
from
one
owner
to
the
other?
unknown
speaker
mr.
saferstein,
how
do
you
laisure,
as
resting
--
finding
of
ambiguity
on
the
word
acquisition,
or
on
the
words
other
disposition?
unknown
speaker
but
where
was
the
ambiguity?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
the
argument
that
you
adopt?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boggs
is
there
any
or
what
title
emphasis
passes
to
the
pawnbroker
under
california
law,
if
any?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
in
some
states
--
some
states
the
pawnbroker
gets
the
title.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fact
is,
he
always
had
ownership
of
these
guns
under
california
law,
and
that
he
borrowed
some
money
and
hypothecated
the
guns,
and
he
--
but
he
always
had
ownership
of
them
as
i
understand
it
under
california
law,
and
when
he
repaid
the
money,
he
just
simply
got
his
guns
back.
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
is
the
one
who
pawned
the
guns.
unknown
speaker
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
pawnbroker,
it
was
--
they
were
his
guns
and
i
don't
see
what
--
unknown
speaker
well,
am
i
wrong
that
he
always
had
ownership
of
the
guns?
unknown
speaker
what,
that
i'm
wrong?
unknown
speaker
but,
whatever
you
may
believe,
the
fact
is
he
always
had
title
of
the
guns?
unknown
speaker
i
had
thought
--
missed
my
brother
rehnquist's
question,
maybe
i
misunderstood.
it
was
directed
to
the
situation
--
this
situation.
i
have
a
gun,
i
rented
it
to
you
for
a
week,
at
the
end
of
the
week
you
return
it
to
me.
now
is
that
an
acquisition
by
me?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
said,
it's
my
gun
and
i've
rented
to
you
for
a
week,
$5.00.
you
returned
it
to
me
at
the
end
of
the
week.
is
that
then
an
acquisition
by
me,
of
my
gun
that
i've
rented
to
you
for
a
week,
under
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
that's
the
question
i
have
understood.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
probably
if
he
didn't
ask
it,
and
i'm
asking
it.
unknown
speaker
acquisition?
unknown
speaker
is
that
--
very
word.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think,
therefore
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
did
not
previously
have
it.
i
parted
with
it
for
a
week.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
--
unknown
speaker
that
would
imply
the
very
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
that
was
in
this
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
is
it
conceded
here
that
the
original
possession
was
illegal?
i
haven't
checked
that
aspect
of
it.
unknown
