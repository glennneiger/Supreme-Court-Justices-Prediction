justice

what
about
the
clause
there,
it
requires
the
pawnbroker
to
keep
records
of
all
"disposition"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
record
includes
--
is
not
restricted
to
sales,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
could
have
said
sales?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
meant
more
that
just
sales.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
pawnshops
swap
and
trade?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
could
have
said
swap.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
(voice
overlap)
the
broadest
word
they
could
find,
didn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
gift
by
a
pawnbroker?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
think
pawnbrokers,
i
didn't
know
they'd
be
giving?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
saferstein,
assuming
that
he
had
sold
the
gun
to
a
second-hand
dealer
and
then
repurchased
it,
you
have
no
question
that
he
was
under
the
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
sold
it.
he
transferred
the
title
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
point
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
we
talking
whether
this
was
a
legitimate
sale?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
only
difference
it
seems
to
me,
your
argument
is
that
this
was
not
a
sale
at
anytime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
position.
justice
thurgood
marshall
never
was
a
sale?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
case,
he
didn't
possess,
he
repossessed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
if
he
just
left
it
there
for
safekeeping?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
agree
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
stop
people
from
getting
guns,
they
didn't
have
them
before?
that
was
the
purpose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
in
this
case.
is
that
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
had
it
--
who
had
three
guns?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
used
the
word
of
the
statute,
he
possessed
three
guns.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
surrendered
the
possession
for
a
period
of
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
resume
his
present
--
his
former
status.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
falls
in
the
phrase
of
repossess?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
he
pawned
it,
did
they
keep
a
record
of
that
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
we've
already
got
a
record
of
the
fact
that
this
man
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
brought
in
the
three
weapons
and
he
doesn't
also
know
he's
a
felon,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
more
does
the
government
get
by
requiring
him
to
again
sign
up
when
he
takes
his
own
guns
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
have
a
problem
on
this,
assuming
that
the
man
refused
to
give
him
the
gun,
and
he
had
to
resort
to
court
action,
even
under
the
new,
modern
form
of
pleading,
will
he
file
an
action
to
possess
or
to
repossess?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
be
to
repossess,
or
he
wouldn't
have
a
cause
of
action,
would
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
original
pawnor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
man
says,"i
just
don't
like
it,
and
i
won't
let
you
have
it."
and
he
says,
"well,
i
want
it."
but
he
says,
"no."
and
he
goes
to
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
action
is,
am
i
correct,
to
repossess?
