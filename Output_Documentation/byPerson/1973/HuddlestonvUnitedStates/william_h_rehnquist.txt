they

doesn't
california
property
law
recognize
the
proposition
that
the
husband
has
the
absolute
right
to
alienate
community
property
so
far
as
a
third
party
like
a
pawnbroker
is
concerned.
he
might
be
responsible
to
the
wife
in
a
separate
action,
but
so
far
as
the
third
party
is
concerned
he
may
deal
with
the
husband
as
the
owner
of
community
property,
may
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
thought
being
the
head
pawnshops
not
been
included
as
a
separate
item,
a
pawnbroker
would've
been
free
to
come
in
and
say,
"look,
i'm
not
within
the
definition
of
a
dealer,
even
had
--
even
though
i
may
make
occasional
sales."

how

possess?
justice

rehnquist
mr.
boggs,
what
if
you
were
to
rent
from
hertz
an
oldsmobile
for
the
weekend,
would
you
--
a
'74
oldsmobile,
would
you
refer
that
as
saying
you
have
acquired
an
oldsmobile?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
wouldn't
be
criminally
liable
for
having
falsified
the
form?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
boggs,
if
congressional
intent
is
as
you
say,
it
seems
that
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
use
the
word
transfer,
rather
than
acquisition,
which
would've
clearly
covered
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
receipt
out
there?
to
be
--
how
to
give
a
cognitive
of
acquisition.
