mr.

you
may

you
don't
attach
any
significance,
i
take
it
then
to
use
by
congress
of
the
broad
term
acquisition,
instead
of
purchase
or
sale?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
its
ordinary
meaning
--
in
its
ordinary
meaning,
what
does
the
word
acquire
convey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
some
point
he
can
foreclose,
can
he
not
under
california
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you'd
agree
that
if
the
pawnbroker
had
foreclosed,
and
the
day
after
the
foreclosure
was
complete,
this
gentleman
came
in
and
said
he
wanted
to
get
that
particular
gun
because
it
had
pearl
handles
or
something
or
some
characteristic,
and
he
was
uninformed
that
it
had
been
foreclosed
the
day
before,
but
he
purchased
it,
you
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you?
if
he
made
an
outright
purchase
after
foreclosure.
chief
justice

e.

although
my
hypothetical,
this
is
after
the
ten
days.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
wouldn't
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
don't
you
think
congress
had
a
special
interest
in
the
independence
of
the
total
number
of
guns
extent
in
preventing
guns
coming
into
the
possession
of
convicted
felons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
mr.
webster
in
his
seventh
edition
which
is
not
necessarily
the
final
word
says
that
"acquire"
means
to
come
into
possession
of.
and
that
acquisition
is
the
act
of
acquiring.
is
that
very
ambiguous
in
your
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
saferstein.
chief

warren
e.

mr.

chief

if
you
lost
possession
of
it
when
you
lent
it
out
and
then
you
regained
possession
of
it
when
you
got
it
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.

do
you
think
that's
true
in
the
same
sense
as
it
would
be

the
possession
of

you

wouldn?t
it
be
true

a
convicted
felon
went
to
a
gun
store
to
purchase
a
gun
that
it
would
be
an
open
public
record
transaction?
chief

how
does
that
help
you
owning

that
this
was

that
this
redemption
was
open
