mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
the
fourteenth
supreme
judicial
district
of
texas.
the
texas
court
held
that
under
the
rule
of
san
diego
building
trades
council
against
garmon,
that
its
jurisdiction
was
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that
it
could
not
adjudicate
petitions
seeking
injunctive
relief
under
state
law
against
picketing
by
american
unions
which
was
directed
against
foreign
flagships.
and
which
protested
that
the
wages
of
the
crews
on
such
ships
were
substandard.
the
picketing
prevented
the
ships
from
being
either
loaded
or
unloaded.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
or
the
windward
shipping
company
--
the
windward
shipping
(london)
ltd.
which
is
a
british
company,
it’s
a
managing
agent
of
one
of
the
picketing
ships,
one
of
the
picketed
ships,
and
the
other
two
companies
are
the
liberian
corporations
which
own
the
respective
vessels.
the
respondents
are
six
american
unions
representing
a
licensed
and
unlicensed
seaman.
the
facts
are
as
follows,
both
of
the
ships
are
registered
under
the
laws
of
liberia
and
both
fly
the
liberian
flag.
both
are
engagement
solely
in
carrying
cargo
in
international
trade.
the
crews
of
both
vessels
are
all
foreign
nationals.
they're
all
represented
by
foreign
unions.
they
work
under
wages
and
working
conditions
which
are
established
in
foreign
ships
articles
and
which
are
in
accordance
with
foreign
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
respondent
unions
do
not
represent
any
of
the
officers
or
crews
on
the
ships.
this
picketing
took
place
in
the
port
of
houston
in
october
of
1971
at
the
--
and
the
pickets
picketed
at
the
gangway
of
the
ships.
the
picketing
was
peaceful,
there
was
no
violence.
one
of
the
vessels,
--
a
ship
called
the
ss
theomana
had
docked
in
houston
to
load
a
cargo,
an
export
cargo
which
was
bound
for
bandar
shahpur
in
iran
and
the
other,
the
northwind
had
docked
to
unload
a
cargo
of
coffee
and
to
take
on
a
cargo
of
grain
which
was
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
it
would've
been
if
the
ships
could've
been
loaded
and
unloaded.
they
were
not
able
to
--.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
yes.
well,
in
this
case
the
ships
were
not
able
to
be
loaded
or
unloaded
because
of
the
picket
lines.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
they
tried
to.
one
of
the
ships
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
partly
unloaded
and
then
the
longshoreman,
when
the
picket
line
came,
they
stopped
the
loading,
they
wouldn’t
cross
the
picket
line.
there
was
no
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
you
were
right.
eventually
that
was
permitted
as
the
concession
by
the
unions
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
so
the
ships
could
be
–
whether
they
could
go
up
and
leave
the
country.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
that
was
done
with
local
labor,
that’s
right.
yes.
but
if
i
understood
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
the
point
is
that
there
was
no
question,
this
case
of
the
crew
performing
any
labor
on
the
shore
side.
so
the
effect
of
the
picketing
was
that
an
organized
labor
including
a
longshoreman
and
others,
respected
the
picket
lines
and
the
unloading
and
loading
of
the
cargoes
could
not
be
accomplished
with
the
exception
of
the
--
a
fact
that
a
slight
concession
was
made
to
allow
the
trimming
of
the
vessel
so
they
could
eventually
depart
from
united
states
without
accomplishing
either
the
loading
or
the
unloading
of
their
cargoes.
this
concession
was
made
after
the
court
action
had
been
commenced.
it
was
a
part
of
the
court
action.
the
picket
signs
read
as
follows,
“attention
to
the
public,
the
wages
and
benefits
paid
to
seamen
aboard
the
vessel
ss
theomana
are
substandard
to
those
of
american
seaman.
this
was
also
an
extreme
damage
to
our
wage
standards
and
loss
of
our
jobs.
please
do
not
patronize
this
vessel.
help
the
american
seaman.
we
have
no
dispute
with
any
other
vessel
on
this
site.”
in
the
picketing
of
the
other
ship
of
course,
the
other
ship’s
name
was
substituted
in
the
picketing
signs.
the
unions
also
passed
out
leaflets
at
the
dockside.
but
the
pickets
had
been
instructed
not
to
answer
any
questions
which
might
have
been
asked
to
them
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
but
merely
to
carry
the
picket
signs
and
to
pass
out
the
leaflets.
the
leaflets
are
printed
on
page
6
of
our
main
brief.
in
any
case,
the
texas
court
found
that
the
picketing
was
directed
to
allegedly
substandard
wages
paid
to
foreign
seamen
with
a
concurrent
request
to
the
public
not
to
patronize
foreign
ships.
the
picket
--
the
background
of
the
picketing
was
that
it
was
planned
at
a
joint
meeting
of
american
seamen’s
unions
where
in
it
was
determined
to
conduct
a
campaign,
a
peaceful
picketing
against
foreign
flagship.
the
picketing
in
this
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
case
was
related
to
other
contemporaneous
picketing
of
foreign
ships
in
houston
and
in
other
ports.
for
example,
we
brought
to
the
court’s
attention
in
a
supplemental
brief
filed
just
after
our
brief
in
support
of
a
petition
for
certiorari,
a
reference
to
the
alabama
state
decision
of
mobile
steamship
association
which
was
a
case
which
evolved
out
of
the
same
picketing
and
this
is
what
--
the
picketing
which
was
taking
place
in
alabama
at
the
same
time.
there
are
other
ships
picketed
in
other
states.
in
summary
form,
the
principal
point
of
our
argument
is
that
this
court
has
already
determined
in
its
previous
decisions
that
the
act
does
not
apply
to
labor
disputes.
between
united
states
unions
and
foreign
ships
which
relate
to
the
maritime
operations
or
it's
sometimes
called
it
to
the
internal
affairs,
anyway
what
people
are
talking
about
is
the
wages
and
conditions
of
the
crew.
these
decisions
culminated
in
the
ariadne
case
which
dealt
specifically
with
picketing
to
protest
substandard
wages.
and
which
set
out
the
test
of
what
determines
whether
the
act
is
or
is
not
applicable
when
such
a
dispute
takes
place
between
an
american
union
and
a
foreign
ship.
the
critical
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
the
activities
of
the
particular
employees
whose
wage
levels
are
being
protested
are
or
are
not
within
the
maritime
operations
of
the
foreign
ships.
a
significant
element
of
these
previous
decisions
of
this
court
which
i
will
refer
to
in
--
more
detail
in
a
moment,
where
the
foreign
relations,
implications
of
any
holding
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
intended
to
govern
disputes
involving
the
internal
affairs
of
foreign
ships.
the
foreign
relations
and
the
domestic
economic
implications
of
this
particular
case
in
the
context
of
what
it
was
a
wide
boycott
of
many,
many
ships
completely
out
shadow
any
implications
that
would
have
existed.
in
the
benz
case
for
example,
or
in
the
incres
case
in
which
picketing
which
involved
a
single
ship.
here
we
had
unions
picketing
all
foreign
ships
which
they
could
reach
and
claiming
that
the
federal
labor
laws
in
effect
give
them
a
protected
right
to
use
picketing
to
bar
such
ships
from
our
shores
unless
the
foreign
ships
pay
their
crews
at
wage
levels
which
are
the
same
as
american
wage
levels.
i
think
the
--
certainly
the
foreign
implications
of
this
are
quite
staggering
if
you
look
at
it
at
the
point
of
view
of
the
foreign
maritime
countries
who
will
be
interested
in
this
decision.
going
to
the
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
the
first
case,
was
the
1957
case
of
benz.
i
think
all
of
the
cases
have
really
gone
back
to
the
initial
benz
decision
and
to
the
reasoning
in
that
decision.
benz
involved
picketing
of
american
ship
by
various
seamen’s
unions
and
the
dispute
which
is
cited
on
the
wages
of
the
crew.
the
unions
in
that
case
were
picketing
to
try
and
induce
the
foreign
ship
owners
to
reemploy
the
members
of
the
crew
at
wage
levels
which
were
higher
than
those
which
had
been
provided
for
in
the
ships
articles.
the
court
in
benz
stated
that
the
question
to
be
decided
was
whether
the
labor
act
applies
to
a
controversy
involving
damages
resulting
from
the
picketing
of
a
foreign
ship
operated
entirely
by
foreign
seamen
under
foreign
articles
while
the
vessel
is
temporarily
in
an
american
port.
the
court
held
that
it
does
not.
the
union's
argument
that
the
case
was
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
was
preempted,
was
rejected
in
benz
fundamentally
because
the
court
said
that
they
found
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
apply
to
disputes
between
nationals
of
foreign
countries,
operating
ships
under
foreign
laws
and
noted
that
the
whole
background
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
concerned
with
industrial
disputes
between
american
employers
and
employees.
for
us
to
run
interference
in
such
a
delicate
field
of
international
relations,
held
the
court,
there
must
be
present
an
affirmative
intention
of
congress
clearly
expressed.
it
alone
has
the
facilities
necessary
to
make
fairly
such
an
important
policy
decision.
it's
interesting
and
we
pointed
this
out
in
our
main
brief
that
in
the
benz
case,
the
unions
expressed
the
same
long
term
goals
as
have
been
argued
are
the
basis
of
the
picketing
in
this
case,
namely
that
they
were
trying
to
protect
the
jobs
of
american
seamen
by
their
picketing
activities
in
benz.
the
court
--
i
think
the
benz
case
shows
that
the
fact
that
the
goals
of
an
american
union
which
are
--
the
fact
that
they
are
domestic
goals
does
not
mean
that
a
dispute
which
centers
on
the
wages
of
a
foreign
crews
of
a
vessel
are
governed
by
the
labor
act.
in
other
words,
the
goals
of
the
union
are
not
to
be
confused
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
dispute.
the
next
case
was
the
mcculloch
case
in
1963.
that
case
involved
whether
or
not
the
nlrb
was
empowered
by
the
labor
act
to
conduct
an
election
on
board
of
foreign
ship.
the
specific
question
that
the
court
said
was
to
be
decided
was
stated
to
be
whether
the
act
as
written
was
intended
to
have
any
application
to
foreign
registered
vessels
employing
alien
seamen.
and
the
court
concluded
in
accordance
with
the
benz
decision
and
i
think
it
just
followed
the
benz
decision
--
it
followed
from
the
benz
decision
that
the
jurisdictional
provisions
of
the
act
do
not
extend
to
the
maritime
operations
of
foreign
flagships
employing
alien
seamen.
the
third
case
was
the
incres
case.
incres,
as
benz
again
involve
picketing
of
a
foreign
ship
by
an
american
union.
and
that
the
same
question
was
involved,
namely,
whether
the
state
courts
were
preempted
from
adjudicating
a
petition
for
relief
filed
by
this
shipowner.
in
the
incres
case,
the
union
which
was
doing
the
picketing
had
been
organized
primary
--
had
been
formed
primarily
to
organized
foreign
seamen.
and
the
picketing
in
that
case
was
part
of
their
campaign
to
try
and
organize
the
foreign
seamen
on
the
ship.
again,
as
in
benz
and
as
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
unions
claimed
in
incres
that
their
goals
were
protection
of
the
job
opportunities
of
american
seamen
against
the
competition
which
lower
costs
of
foreign
flagships
bring.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
highly
--
it
would
be
deemed
by
any
foreign
country
to
be
highly
provocative.
if
it
were
thought
that
federal
law
protected
the
right
of
the
union
to
bar
foreign
ships
from
u.s.
trade
because
the
foreign
ships
were
not
paying
their
crews
the
same
wage
levels
that
american
ships
are.
now
whether
or
not
and
what
form
any
retaliatory
action
might
take,
it’s
probably
a
question
for
the
diplomats
but
i
think
that
they
can’t
overlook
the
fact
that
a
--
there's
every
likelihood
that
something
would
be
done.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
do,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
have
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
any
--
in
my
experience
in
anywhere
in.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
no.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
there's
quite
a
bit
in
the
record
on
the
pay
of
the
crews
on
the
ship.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
the
pay
--
it
is
true
that
the
crews
are
paid
substantially
less
than
american
seamen.
it
is
also
true
that
this
a
--
i’m
not
sure,
i’m
not
going
outside
of
the
record
here.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
no
there
isn’t
your
honor
but
these
are
foreign
seamen.
i
can
say
that
it
was
testified
to
in
congress
and
i
did
make
a
citation,
there
is
a
citation
to
the
testimony
in
our
main
brief
that
the
wages
on
american
ships
are
normally
about
three
or
four
times
higher
than
those
on
area
foreign
ships
that
the
american
able
bodied
seamen
for
example
makes
roughly
the
equivalent
of
what
the
captain
of
a
foreign
ship
makes.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
these
were
liberian
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
these
liberian
flagships,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
it’s
certainly
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
do
you
mean,
were
they
eventually
american
owned
or
something
like
that?
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
very
much
doubt
it.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
yes.
there
was
--
quite
a
few
of
the
crewmen
were
from
--
i
believe
were
from
sierra
leone,
they
belong
to
the
sierra
leone
seamen’s
federation.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
some
of
the
officers
of
the
crew
were
greek.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
would
give
the
--
it
would
give
to
the
american
seamen’s
unions
the
absolute
power
to
bar
any
foreign
ship
from
american
ports
who
was
--
who
did
not
pay
their
crews
on
american
wage
standards.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
there
is
that
possibility.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
no,
because
the
texas
court
has
not
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
we
may
have
to
face
first
amendment
arguments
eventually.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
that’s
right.
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
court
below,
it's
two
years
since
the
picketing
took
place.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
and
unfortunately
if
we
win
as
i
think
we
should,
the
--
when
two
years
have
passed,
during
which
time
here,
the
ships
don’t
dare
come
to
the
united
states
because
there's
an
outstanding
threat
in
the
record
that
anytime
they
come,
they’re
going
to
be
shutdown
with
picketing.
well,
you
just
have
a
very
strange
legal
situation
because
there's
just
too
much
delay
for
the
question
be
--
in
the
questions
being
decided.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
dare
say
that
that
can.
that
if
the
nlrb
say
that
it
did,
we’d
be
back
here
again.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
there
isn’t
any
question
your
honor
in
this
particular
dispute.
it
was
a
primary
dispute
between
the
union
and
the
ship.
there
was
no
question
here
of
a
secondary
dispute.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
think
that
the
--
there
is
no
arguability
here
because
i
think
in
the
ariadne
case,
the
test
is
laid
down,
that
has
to
be
followed
and
if
you
follow
that
test
you
come
out,
if
the
texas
court
had
followed
that
test
which
was
laid
down
in
that
decision,
it
would've
come
out
with
the
answer
and
that
--
i
don’t
know
what
arguability
means
because
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
but
there
isn’t
any
way
you
can
take
a
question
of
this
sort
to
the
board
because
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
guess
one
thing
you
can
--
i
--
it
was
very
tough
to
imagine
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
there
is
no
procedure
for
you
to
get
there
to
find
out
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
said
that
it's
so
hard
to
get
relief
or
get
even
a
ruling
on
anything
in
this
kind
of
cases.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
that’s
right.
i
think
what
we’re
getting
over
in
to
a
discussion
hereof
of
the
arguably
subject
rule
of
garmon.
now,
i
think
that
on
a
question
of
this
sort
where
the
question
is
one
of
the
initial
applicability
of
the
labor
act
to
a
situation
not
whether
particular
activity
under
the
labor
act
is
protected
or
prohibited.
i
don’t
think
the
test
should
be
whether
it
is
arguable,
whether
i
can
stand
here
and
somebody
else
can
stand
on
the
other
side
and
two
can
argue
it
out.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
that
there
is
preemption.
i
think
the
state
court
should
be
allowed
to
make
the
decision
of
whether
the
--
under
the
rules
that
are
set
out
by
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
act
applies.
if
the
act
applies,
alright,
then
it’s
arguable
that
the
activity
maybe
protected
or
prohibited
and
if
the
act
applies
then
the
state
court
must
step
back
but
if
it
doesn’t,
i
think
that
the
state
court
should
be
able
to
determine
under
its
own
law
whether
or
not
petitioner
is
entitled
to
relief.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
alright.
suppose
we
--
which
the
only
unfair
labor
practice,
we
might
have
followed,
say
an
8
(b)
(7)
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
but
we’d
--
we
did
file
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
one
of
the
companies
did
file
an
8
(b)
4
(b)
charge.
mind
you
this
--
the
8
(b)
4
(b)
charge
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
it
was
withdrawn
voluntarily.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
want
to
make
very
clear
what
that
charge
was,
it
never
alleged
that
the
picketing
directed
against
these
ships
was
a
secondary
boycott.
that
was
alleging
that
picketing
directed
against
the
shore
side
facilities
of
a
third
party,
a
shipping
--
i
forgot
the
name
of
the
company,
it
was
some
other
company
that
some
stevedoring
company
that
that
amounted
to
the
secondary
boycott.
it
was
never
doubted
that
the
primary
dispute
was
between
the
union
and
the
foreign
ships
and
i
think
--
i
wasn’t
handling,
we
weren’t
handling
the
case
at
that
stage.
but
i
would
guess
that
the
counsel
who
were
handling
had
decided
that
insofar
as
that
picketing
was
concerned
that
the
more
dry
dock
rules
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
incres
held
that
the
act
doesn’t
apply
to
organizing
picketing
and
so
forth,
it's
quite
plain
from
incres
that
should
be
thrown
out,
it
--
there’d
be
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
no,
no.
it
might
be
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(7).
the
union
might
be
picketing
in
violation
of
8
(b)
(7)
but
that
doesn’t
do
you
any
good
if
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
and
if
the
act
doesn’t
apply
and
they
would
have
to
say
and
i
agree
with
it.
they
would
have
to
say
that
under
incres
they
could
not
listen
to
an
8
(b)
(7)
charge
that
was
filed
by
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
it
doesn’t
argue
and
cover
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
think
it’s
hard
to
say.
i’m
going
to
--
if
i
haven’t
used
up
my
time
i’d
like
to
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
the
fourteenth
supreme
judicial
district
of
texas.
the
texas
court
held
that
under
the
rule
of
san
diego
building
trades
council
against
garmon,
that
its
jurisdiction
was
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that
it
could
not
adjudicate
petitions
seeking
injunctive
relief
under
state
law
against
picketing
by
american
unions
which
was
directed
against
foreign
flagships.
and
which
protested
that
the
wages
of
the
crews
on
such
ships
were
substandard.
the
picketing
prevented
the
ships
from
being
either
loaded
or
unloaded.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
or
the
windward
shipping
company
--
the
windward
shipping
(london)
ltd.
which
is
a
british
company,
it’s
a
managing
agent
of
one
of
the
picketing
ships,
one
of
the
picketed
ships,
and
the
other
two
companies
are
the
liberian
corporations
which
own
the
respective
vessels.
the
respondents
are
six
american
unions
representing
a
licensed
and
unlicensed
seaman.
the
facts
are
as
follows,
both
of
the
ships
are
registered
under
the
laws
of
liberia
and
both
fly
the
liberian
flag.
both
are
engagement
solely
in
carrying
cargo
in
international
trade.
the
crews
of
both
vessels
are
all
foreign
nationals.
they're
all
represented
by
foreign
unions.
they
work
under
wages
and
working
conditions
which
are
established
in
foreign
ships
articles
and
which
are
in
accordance
with
foreign
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
respondent
unions
do
not
represent
any
of
the
officers
or
crews
on
the
ships.
this
picketing
took
place
in
the
port
of
houston
in
october
of
1971
at
the
--
and
the
pickets
picketed
at
the
gangway
of
the
ships.
the
picketing
was
peaceful,
there
was
no
violence.
one
of
the
vessels,
--
a
ship
called
the
ss
theomana
had
docked
in
houston
to
load
a
cargo,
an
export
cargo
which
was
bound
for
bandar
shahpur
in
iran
and
the
other,
the
northwind
had
docked
to
unload
a
cargo
of
coffee
and
to
take
on
a
cargo
of
grain
which
was
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
it
would've
been
if
the
ships
could've
been
loaded
and
unloaded.
they
were
not
able
to
--.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
yes.
well,
in
this
case
the
ships
were
not
able
to
be
loaded
or
unloaded
because
of
the
picket
lines.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
they
tried
to.
one
of
the
ships
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
partly
unloaded
and
then
the
longshoreman,
when
the
picket
line
came,
they
stopped
the
loading,
they
wouldn’t
cross
the
picket
line.
there
was
no
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
you
were
right.
eventually
that
was
permitted
as
the
concession
by
the
unions
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
so
the
ships
could
be
–
whether
they
could
go
up
and
leave
the
country.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
that
was
done
with
local
labor,
that’s
right.
yes.
but
if
i
understood
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
the
point
is
that
there
was
no
question,
this
case
of
the
crew
performing
any
labor
on
the
shore
side.
so
the
effect
of
the
picketing
was
that
an
organized
labor
including
a
longshoreman
and
others,
respected
the
picket
lines
and
the
unloading
and
loading
of
the
cargoes
could
not
be
accomplished
with
the
exception
of
the
--
a
fact
that
a
slight
concession
was
made
to
allow
the
trimming
of
the
vessel
so
they
could
eventually
depart
from
united
states
without
accomplishing
either
the
loading
or
the
unloading
of
their
cargoes.
this
concession
was
made
after
the
court
action
had
been
commenced.
it
was
a
part
of
the
court
action.
the
picket
signs
read
as
follows,
“attention
to
the
public,
the
wages
and
benefits
paid
to
seamen
aboard
the
vessel
ss
theomana
are
substandard
to
those
of
american
seaman.
this
was
also
an
extreme
damage
to
our
wage
standards
and
loss
of
our
jobs.
please
do
not
patronize
this
vessel.
help
the
american
seaman.
we
have
no
dispute
with
any
other
vessel
on
this
site.”
in
the
picketing
of
the
other
ship
of
course,
the
other
ship’s
name
was
substituted
in
the
picketing
signs.
the
unions
also
passed
out
leaflets
at
the
dockside.
but
the
pickets
had
been
instructed
not
to
answer
any
questions
which
might
have
been
asked
to
them
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
but
merely
to
carry
the
picket
signs
and
to
pass
out
the
leaflets.
the
leaflets
are
printed
on
page
6
of
our
main
brief.
in
any
case,
the
texas
court
found
that
the
picketing
was
directed
to
allegedly
substandard
wages
paid
to
foreign
seamen
with
a
concurrent
request
to
the
public
not
to
patronize
foreign
ships.
the
picket
--
the
background
of
the
picketing
was
that
it
was
planned
at
a
joint
meeting
of
american
seamen’s
unions
where
in
it
was
determined
to
conduct
a
campaign,
a
peaceful
picketing
against
foreign
flagship.
the
picketing
in
this
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
case
was
related
to
other
contemporaneous
picketing
of
foreign
ships
in
houston
and
in
other
ports.
for
example,
we
brought
to
the
court’s
attention
in
a
supplemental
brief
filed
just
after
our
brief
in
support
of
a
petition
for
certiorari,
a
reference
to
the
alabama
state
decision
of
mobile
steamship
association
which
was
a
case
which
evolved
out
of
the
same
picketing
and
this
is
what
--
the
picketing
which
was
taking
place
in
alabama
at
the
same
time.
there
are
other
ships
picketed
in
other
states.
in
summary
form,
the
principal
point
of
our
argument
is
that
this
court
has
already
determined
in
its
previous
decisions
that
the
act
does
not
apply
to
labor
disputes.
between
united
states
unions
and
foreign
ships
which
relate
to
the
maritime
operations
or
it's
sometimes
called
it
to
the
internal
affairs,
anyway
what
people
are
talking
about
is
the
wages
and
conditions
of
the
crew.
these
decisions
culminated
in
the
ariadne
case
which
dealt
specifically
with
picketing
to
protest
substandard
wages.
and
which
set
out
the
test
of
what
determines
whether
the
act
is
or
is
not
applicable
when
such
a
dispute
takes
place
between
an
american
union
and
a
foreign
ship.
the
critical
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
the
activities
of
the
particular
employees
whose
wage
levels
are
being
protested
are
or
are
not
within
the
maritime
operations
of
the
foreign
ships.
a
significant
element
of
these
previous
decisions
of
this
court
which
i
will
refer
to
in
--
more
detail
in
a
moment,
where
the
foreign
relations,
implications
of
any
holding
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
intended
to
govern
disputes
involving
the
internal
affairs
of
foreign
ships.
the
foreign
relations
and
the
domestic
economic
implications
of
this
particular
case
in
the
context
of
what
it
was
a
wide
boycott
of
many,
many
ships
completely
out
shadow
any
implications
that
would
have
existed.
in
the
benz
case
for
example,
or
in
the
incres
case
in
which
picketing
which
involved
a
single
ship.
here
we
had
unions
picketing
all
foreign
ships
which
they
could
reach
and
claiming
that
the
federal
labor
laws
in
effect
give
them
a
protected
right
to
use
picketing
to
bar
such
ships
from
our
shores
unless
the
foreign
ships
pay
their
crews
at
wage
levels
which
are
the
same
as
american
wage
levels.
i
think
the
--
certainly
the
foreign
implications
of
this
are
quite
staggering
if
you
look
at
it
at
the
point
of
view
of
the
foreign
maritime
countries
who
will
be
interested
in
this
decision.
going
to
the
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
the
first
case,
was
the
1957
case
of
benz.
i
think
all
of
the
cases
have
really
gone
back
to
the
initial
benz
decision
and
to
the
reasoning
in
that
decision.
benz
involved
picketing
of
american
ship
by
various
seamen’s
unions
and
the
dispute
which
is
cited
on
the
wages
of
the
crew.
the
unions
in
that
case
were
picketing
to
try
and
induce
the
foreign
ship
owners
to
reemploy
the
members
of
the
crew
at
wage
levels
which
were
higher
than
those
which
had
been
provided
for
in
the
ships
articles.
the
court
in
benz
stated
that
the
question
to
be
decided
was
whether
the
labor
act
applies
to
a
controversy
involving
damages
resulting
from
the
picketing
of
a
foreign
ship
operated
entirely
by
foreign
seamen
under
foreign
articles
while
the
vessel
is
temporarily
in
an
american
port.
the
court
held
that
it
does
not.
the
union's
argument
that
the
case
was
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
was
preempted,
was
rejected
in
benz
fundamentally
because
the
court
said
that
they
found
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
apply
to
disputes
between
nationals
of
foreign
countries,
operating
ships
under
foreign
laws
and
noted
that
the
whole
background
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
concerned
with
industrial
disputes
between
american
employers
and
employees.
for
us
to
run
interference
in
such
a
delicate
field
of
international
relations,
held
the
court,
there
must
be
present
an
affirmative
intention
of
congress
clearly
expressed.
it
alone
has
the
facilities
necessary
to
make
fairly
such
an
important
policy
decision.
it's
interesting
and
we
pointed
this
out
in
our
main
brief
that
in
the
benz
case,
the
unions
expressed
the
same
long
term
goals
as
have
been
argued
are
the
basis
of
the
picketing
in
this
case,
namely
that
they
were
trying
to
protect
the
jobs
of
american
seamen
by
their
picketing
activities
in
benz.
the
court
--
i
think
the
benz
case
shows
that
the
fact
that
the
goals
of
an
american
union
which
are
--
the
fact
that
they
are
domestic
goals
does
not
mean
that
a
dispute
which
centers
on
the
wages
of
a
foreign
crews
of
a
vessel
are
governed
by
the
labor
act.
in
other
words,
the
goals
of
the
union
are
not
to
be
confused
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
dispute.
the
next
case
was
the
mcculloch
case
in
1963.
that
case
involved
whether
or
not
the
nlrb
was
empowered
by
the
labor
act
to
conduct
an
election
on
board
of
foreign
ship.
the
specific
question
that
the
court
said
was
to
be
decided
was
stated
to
be
whether
the
act
as
written
was
intended
to
have
any
application
to
foreign
registered
vessels
employing
alien
seamen.
and
the
court
concluded
in
accordance
with
the
benz
decision
and
i
think
it
just
followed
the
benz
decision
--
it
followed
from
the
benz
decision
that
the
jurisdictional
provisions
of
the
act
do
not
extend
to
the
maritime
operations
of
foreign
flagships
employing
alien
seamen.
the
third
case
was
the
incres
case.
incres,
as
benz
again
involve
picketing
of
a
foreign
ship
by
an
american
union.
and
that
the
same
question
was
involved,
namely,
whether
the
state
courts
were
preempted
from
adjudicating
a
petition
for
relief
filed
by
this
shipowner.
in
the
incres
case,
the
union
which
was
doing
the
picketing
had
been
organized
primary
--
had
been
formed
primarily
to
organized
foreign
seamen.
and
the
picketing
in
that
case
was
part
of
their
campaign
to
try
and
organize
the
foreign
seamen
on
the
ship.
again,
as
in
benz
and
as
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
unions
claimed
in
incres
that
their
goals
were
protection
of
the
job
opportunities
of
american
seamen
against
the
competition
which
lower
costs
of
foreign
flagships
bring.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
highly
--
it
would
be
deemed
by
any
foreign
country
to
be
highly
provocative.
if
it
were
thought
that
federal
law
protected
the
right
of
the
union
to
bar
foreign
ships
from
u.s.
trade
because
the
foreign
ships
were
not
paying
their
crews
the
same
wage
levels
that
american
ships
are.
now
whether
or
not
and
what
form
any
retaliatory
action
might
take,
it’s
probably
a
question
for
the
diplomats
but
i
think
that
they
can’t
overlook
the
fact
that
a
--
there's
every
likelihood
that
something
would
be
done.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
do,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
have
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
any
--
in
my
experience
in
anywhere
in.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
no.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
there's
quite
a
bit
in
the
record
on
the
pay
of
the
crews
on
the
ship.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
the
pay
--
it
is
true
that
the
crews
are
paid
substantially
less
than
american
seamen.
it
is
also
true
that
this
a
--
i’m
not
sure,
i’m
not
going
outside
of
the
record
here.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
no
there
isn’t
your
honor
but
these
are
foreign
seamen.
i
can
say
that
it
was
testified
to
in
congress
and
i
did
make
a
citation,
there
is
a
citation
to
the
testimony
in
our
main
brief
that
the
wages
on
american
ships
are
normally
about
three
or
four
times
higher
than
those
on
area
foreign
ships
that
the
american
able
bodied
seamen
for
example
makes
roughly
the
equivalent
of
what
the
captain
of
a
foreign
ship
makes.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
these
were
liberian
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
these
liberian
flagships,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
it’s
certainly
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
do
you
mean,
were
they
eventually
american
owned
or
something
like
that?
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
very
much
doubt
it.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
yes.
there
was
--
quite
a
few
of
the
crewmen
were
from
--
i
believe
were
from
sierra
leone,
they
belong
to
the
sierra
leone
seamen’s
federation.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
some
of
the
officers
of
the
crew
were
greek.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
would
give
the
--
it
would
give
to
the
american
seamen’s
unions
the
absolute
power
to
bar
any
foreign
ship
from
american
ports
who
was
--
who
did
not
pay
their
crews
on
american
wage
standards.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
there
is
that
possibility.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
no,
because
the
texas
court
has
not
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
we
may
have
to
face
first
amendment
arguments
eventually.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
that’s
right.
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
court
below,
it's
two
years
since
the
picketing
took
place.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
and
unfortunately
if
we
win
as
i
think
we
should,
the
--
when
two
years
have
passed,
during
which
time
here,
the
ships
don’t
dare
come
to
the
united
states
because
there's
an
outstanding
threat
in
the
record
that
anytime
they
come,
they’re
going
to
be
shutdown
with
picketing.
well,
you
just
have
a
very
strange
legal
situation
because
there's
just
too
much
delay
for
the
question
be
--
in
the
questions
being
decided.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
dare
say
that
that
can.
that
if
the
nlrb
say
that
it
did,
we’d
be
back
here
again.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
there
isn’t
any
question
your
honor
in
this
particular
dispute.
it
was
a
primary
dispute
between
the
union
and
the
ship.
there
was
no
question
here
of
a
secondary
dispute.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
think
that
the
--
there
is
no
arguability
here
because
i
think
in
the
ariadne
case,
the
test
is
laid
down,
that
has
to
be
followed
and
if
you
follow
that
test
you
come
out,
if
the
texas
court
had
followed
that
test
which
was
laid
down
in
that
decision,
it
would've
come
out
with
the
answer
and
that
--
i
don’t
know
what
arguability
means
because
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
but
there
isn’t
any
way
you
can
take
a
question
of
this
sort
to
the
board
because
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
guess
one
thing
you
can
--
i
--
it
was
very
tough
to
imagine
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
there
is
no
procedure
for
you
to
get
there
to
find
out
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
said
that
it's
so
hard
to
get
relief
or
get
even
a
ruling
on
anything
in
this
kind
of
cases.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
that’s
right.
i
think
what
we’re
getting
over
in
to
a
discussion
hereof
of
the
arguably
subject
rule
of
garmon.
now,
i
think
that
on
a
question
of
this
sort
where
the
question
is
one
of
the
initial
applicability
of
the
labor
act
to
a
situation
not
whether
particular
activity
under
the
labor
act
is
protected
or
prohibited.
i
don’t
think
the
test
should
be
whether
it
is
arguable,
whether
i
can
stand
here
and
somebody
else
can
stand
on
the
other
side
and
two
can
argue
it
out.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
that
there
is
preemption.
i
think
the
state
court
should
be
allowed
to
make
the
decision
of
whether
the
--
under
the
rules
that
are
set
out
by
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
act
applies.
if
the
act
applies,
alright,
then
it’s
arguable
that
the
activity
maybe
protected
or
prohibited
and
if
the
act
applies
then
the
state
court
must
step
back
but
if
it
doesn’t,
i
think
that
the
state
court
should
be
able
to
determine
under
its
own
law
whether
or
not
petitioner
is
entitled
to
relief.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
alright.
suppose
we
--
which
the
only
unfair
labor
practice,
we
might
have
followed,
say
an
8
(b)
(7)
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
but
we’d
--
we
did
file
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
one
of
the
companies
did
file
an
8
(b)
4
(b)
charge.
mind
you
this
--
the
8
(b)
4
(b)
charge
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
it
was
withdrawn
voluntarily.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
i
want
to
make
very
clear
what
that
charge
was,
it
never
alleged
that
the
picketing
directed
against
these
ships
was
a
secondary
boycott.
that
was
alleging
that
picketing
directed
against
the
shore
side
facilities
of
a
third
party,
a
shipping
--
i
forgot
the
name
of
the
company,
it
was
some
other
company
that
some
stevedoring
company
that
that
amounted
to
the
secondary
boycott.
it
was
never
doubted
that
the
primary
dispute
was
between
the
union
and
the
foreign
ships
and
i
think
--
i
wasn’t
handling,
we
weren’t
handling
the
case
at
that
stage.
but
i
would
guess
that
the
counsel
who
were
handling
had
decided
that
insofar
as
that
picketing
was
concerned
that
the
more
dry
dock
rules
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
incres
held
that
the
act
doesn’t
apply
to
organizing
picketing
and
so
forth,
it's
quite
plain
from
incres
that
should
be
thrown
out,
it
--
there’d
be
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
no,
no.
it
might
be
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(7).
the
union
might
be
picketing
in
violation
of
8
(b)
(7)
but
that
doesn’t
do
you
any
good
if
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
and
if
the
act
doesn’t
apply
and
they
would
have
to
say
and
i
agree
with
it.
they
would
have
to
say
that
under
incres
they
could
not
listen
to
an
8
(b)
(7)
charge
that
was
filed
by
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
well,
it
doesn’t
argue
and
cover
--
mr.
robert
s.
ogden,
jr.
i
think
it’s
hard
to
say.
i’m
going
to
--
if
i
haven’t
used
up
my
time
i’d
like
to
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
