in
winward
shipping.
that
case
comes
to
us
from
the
texas
civil
court
of
appeals.
that
court
affirmed
a
refusal
by
the
texas
trial
court
in
houston
to
entertain
an
application
by
the
petitioners
who
were
ship
owners
for
injunctive
relief
against
picketing
that
was
going
on
at
the
houston
docks.
the
picketing
had
been
undertaken
by
the
unions
because
of
the
concern
over
the
number
of
american
jobs
being
lost
to
foreign
ships.
the
picket
signs
called
attention
to
this
fact
and
made
it
clear
they
had
no
dispute
with
any
vessel
on
the
site
other
than
these
particular
foreign
owned
vessels
whom
we're
paying
substandard
wages.
the
crews
of
both
picketed
vessels
were
comprised
entirely
of
foreign
national
represented
by
foreign
unions
and
employed
under
foreign
articles
of
agreement.
the
texas
trail
court
felt
that
its
jurisdiction
had
been
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
agreed
and
we
ranted
certiorari.
we
find
that
this
dispute
involving
as
it
did
the
maritime
operations
of
foreign
flag
ships
was
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
and
therefore,
we
reverse
the
judgments
below.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
