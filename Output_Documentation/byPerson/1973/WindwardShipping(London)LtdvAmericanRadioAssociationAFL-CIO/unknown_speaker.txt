unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
labor
was
used
to
make
the
ships
seaworthy
to
trim
the
cargo
by
agreement,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
to
get
the
cargo
trans
so
that
ship
would
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
right.
wasn’t
that
done
with
local
labors?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ogden,
is
this
the
kind
of
thing
that
leads
to
retaliatory
action
in
home
ports,
this
vessel?
unknown
speaker
you
still
live
in
london?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
action
of
this
kind,
the
british
talks
in
your
experience?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
it’s
not
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
it’s
not
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
are
any
ships
flying
the
liberian
flag.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
the
nationality
of
the
crewman
at
all
other
than
that
they
were
just
generally
foreign?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ogden,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
would
show
what
the
effect
would
be
if
the
ruling
of
the
texas
court
became
the
law
of
the
land,
would
it
dry
up
as
a
practical
matter
the
use
of
foreign
ships
coming
to
our
ports
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
somebody
then
decided
based
on
laws
that
all
that
the
texas
court
said
it
was
preempt,
didn’t
it
say
that
arguably
protected?
unknown
speaker
or
have
somebody
decide
it
that
wasn’t
actually
protected.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
win
this
case,
you’ll
still
lose
on
the
long
run
because
you’ve
just
begin
to
litigate,
suppose
the
chamber
of
commerce
came
down
to
with
the
same
sides,
do
you
think
the
first
amendment
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
with
respect
to
the
issue
here
but
eventually
you
may
have
to
face
certainly
first
amendment
argument.
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
were
here
on
this
issue.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well
is
there
anyway
that
the
--
is
there
anyway
that
your
clients
can
get
this
question
of
coverage
decided?
no
one
has
yet
decided
whether
the
act
actually
covers
this
--
actually
protects
this
activity.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
but
i
take
it
--
a
more
dry
dock
formula
would
have
considerable
significance
for
the
board
in
that
determination,
would
it
not?
i
gather
this
texas
court
said
that
the
criteria
of
more
dry
dock
were
satisfied,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
the
board
would
agree
with
the
texas
court,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
it’s
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited.
but
the
ultimate
resolution
of
that
question
is
for
the
board
if
there's
preemption,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
way
you
could
get
the
question
to
the
board?
unknown
speaker
the
texas
court
said
this
is
in
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
how
do
you
get
there
to
find
out
whether
the
arguable
case
is
so
or
not?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
declaratory
--
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
you
could
be
dragged
there
but
you
couldn’t
go
there
yourself.
unknown
speaker
there
is
anyway.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don’t
you
--
why
didn’t
the
--
if
the
court
thought
that
this
was
arguably
protected
or
prohibited
why
didn’t
you
file
a
charge
if
the
union
was
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
say,
picketing
for
a
condition
for
more
than
--
unknown
speaker
not
on
8
(b)
4
(b)?
unknown
speaker
not
an
8
(b)
4
(b)?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
well,
what
happened
to
them?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
now
what
about
the
8
(b)
(7)
possibility?
unknown
speaker
so
i
gather
you
are
feeling
--
but
if
they
--
if
you
were
thrown
out
for
one
of
jurisdiction
then
you
would
know
that
in
the
board’s
opinion,
that
the
arguable
case
that
went
out
the
window.
it
didn’t
cover
it.
unknown
speaker
so
the
act
doesn’t
arguably
cover,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
you
don’t
know
what
the
board
would've
said,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather,
in
responding,
you
are
not
withdrawing
your
application
to
us
to
reject.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
your
ground,
i
gather
is
that
there's
nothing
in
our
rules
which
support
it.
unknown
speaker
solicitor
general
is
firing
about
it.

speaker
i
