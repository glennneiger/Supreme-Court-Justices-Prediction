mr.
howard
schulman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
howard
schulman
i’m
going
to
address
myself
if
i
can,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
all
the
issues.
fundamentally,
there
is
no
disagreement
between
counsel
and
parties
here
that
the
conduct
engaged
by
the
respondents
here
is
normal,
typical,
protected
section
7
activity.
it
is
the
added
factor
that
the
vessel
which
was
involved
is
foreign.
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
that
because
i
think
it’s
how
you
approach
the
case.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
i
think
that’s
quite
significant
mr.
chief
justice.
american
seamen
as
every
other
american
worker
has
been
granted
a
section
7
right
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
benz
clearly.
and
what
these
seamen
are
doing
in
this
case
as
so
distinguished
from
benz
on
the
other
case
is
as
follows.
they're
saying
to
the
public
at
large,
“look,
we
were
90,000
seamen,
only
a
short
time
ago.
as
a
result
of
the
substandard
wages
and
conditions
we’re
down
to
30,000
people.
these
are
one
of
the
vessels.
we
don’t
want
to
represent
the
people.
we
don’t
want
to
aid
them.
we’re
not
seeking
organization.
we’re
not
seeking
to
apply
the
act.
what
we’re
asking
you,
the
public
is
ostracized
them
and
patronized
american
ships.”
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
because
i
think
in
that
particular
instance
mr.
chief
justice
you'd
have
a
secondary
boycott.
but
then
they
have
the
certain
right
to
publicize,
they
would
have
the
right
to
go
on
a
media
or
communication
as
we
did
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
to
hand
out
pamphlets
and
literature.
mr.
howard
schulman
well,
if
they
would
induce
a
neutral
then
obviously,
there’ll
be
a
secondary
boycott.
but
addressing
my
remarks
to
the
issues
here,
first
to
answer
some
of
the
inquiries
made
by
members
of
the
bench,
yes,
the
wage
rates
provided
in
this
vessel
which
is
substandard
are
found
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
$68.10
to
a
seaman
aboard
this
vessel
for
month’s
wages.
mr.
howard
schulman
thank
you.
mr.
howard
schulman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
of
the
--
just
before
the
recess
at
yesterday’s
session,
discussion
was
had
relative
to
the
wages
being
paid
the
seamen
aboard
these
foreign
vessels
and
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
only
purpose
of
that
is
to
show
the
truthfulness
of
the
picketing
pursuant
to
this
court’s
dictates
in
linn
versus
plant
guards.
the
underlying
issue
in
this
case,
as
we
see
it,
is
really
one
of
jurisdiction.
we
do
not
think
there's
an
issue
present
here
of
access
to
court,
but
one
of
applying
jurisdictional
standards.
as
we
see
it,
this
case
breaks
down
into
a
dichotomy
on
the
one
hand
of
what
we
refer
to
as
conduct
of
the
trilogy
nature,
meaning
the
benz,
incres,
and
mcculloch.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
present,
this
court’s
holdings
in
marine
cooks
and
panama
and
ariadne
as
to
whether
it
really
is
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights,
and
i'd
like
to
direct
my
attention
to
that
dichotomy.
it
is
clear
that
in
mcculloch,
benz,
and
incres
present
there
was
an
attempt
and
conduct
by
the
unions
to
organize,
represent,
in
effect,
be
the
statutory
bargaining
agent
for
the
people
aboard
that
--
those
vessels.
and
this
court,
in
ariadne,
summarized
that
conduct
in
the
holdings.
and,
contrary
to
what
my
friend
says,
the
--
there
are
only
certain
maritime
operations
of
a
foreign-flag
vessel
which
are
without
the
reach
of
a
statute
and
congress
never
intended
the
statute
to
be
applicable.
and
when
the
act
was
construed
in
the
trilogy
cases,
it
was
held
that
the
construction
they
have
sought
not
requested,
this
court
said,
would
necessitate
inquiry
into
the
internal
discipline
and
order
of
a
foreign
vessel.
and,
it
was
that
intervention
and
only
that
intervention,
that
this
court
felt
and
the
holdings
go,
would
bring
about
the
possible
conflict
in
international
law.
thus,
as
this
court
went
on
further
in
ariadne,
the
act
never
had
any
intention
to
cover
in
its
coverage
disputes
between
foreign
ships
and
their
foreign
crews.
that
is
what
is
referred
to
as
to
the
internal
order
and
discipline.
the
court
again,
referring
to
the
ariadne
case,
said,
“the
conduct,
there
present,
belied
any
intent
of
involvement
in
that
relationship
and
it
is
that
relationship
which
could
possibly
lead
to
the
conflict
with
foreign
or
international
law
and,
in
effect,
present
in
the
trilogy
cases
was
our
exporting
of
american
law
upon
the
vessel.
now
we
turn
to
the
other
part
of
the
dichotomy,
the
activity
of
american
citizens
here
in
the
united
states
and
the
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights
and,
that,
we
have
in
marine
panama
--
marine
cooks
versus
panama
and
in
ariadne.
in
those
cases,
we
have
american
citizens
saying
--
paraphrasing
as
follows,
“look,
we
have
had
employment
here
in
the
united
states
for
many,
many
years.
and
we
now
find
ourselves
in
a
terrible
situation
economically.
for
many
reasons,
truthful
reasons,
our
employment
has
been
taken
from
us
here.
right
here
in
new
york
harbor,
in
seattle
harbor,
in
san
francisco.
and
we
ask
you
as
fellow
citizens.
please
do
not
patronize
these
vessels
which,
we
are
truthfully
saying,
are
taking
our
employment.”
that's
section
7
rights
as
we
see
it
and
that
is
the
exercise
by
american
seamen,
as
a
class
of
working
people,
the
rights
to
which
they
are
entitled.
now
within
that
dichotomy,
and
that's
what
we're
faced
with,
the
state
court
has
the
jurisdiction.
as
this
state
court
below
did,
it
took
the
case
and
the
court
said,
“where
does
this
proverbial
apple
fall?
does
it
fall
within
the
trilogy
conduct
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
labor
board's
jurisdiction
as
mcculloch,
benz,
and
incres
hold
or
does
it
fall
on
the
other
side
of
the
orchard
which,
in
effect,
is
the
preservation
of
their
domestic
employment?”
the
court
made
the
decision.
the
court
concluded
that
the
conduct
engaged
here
was
not
trilogy
conduct
and
that,
under
those
circumstances,
having
exercised
jurisdiction
and
having
found
that
it
is
activities
to
protect
their
domestic
employment,
the
court
concluded
that
based
upon
this
court’s
decision
such
conduct
is
suggested
as
actually
protected
conduct
and
certainly
arguably
protected.
mr.
howard
schulman
no.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
the
message
--
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
if
we,
as
american
seamen,
have
our
employment
opportunities,
then
we
have
no
protest.
now,
but
what
we
are
seeking
is
our
american
opportunities.
to
give
a
classic
example,
yesterday,
in
reference
to
a
question
referred
to
my
friend,
he
mentioned
a
case
in
mobile,
alabama,
before
the
alabama
supreme
court.
and
in
that
case
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
while
these
people
were
protesting
for
their
loss
of
employment,
two
american
vessels
were
laid
up
looking
for
work.
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
not
seeking
under
any
circumstances,
to
tell
to
any
foreign
nation
that
they
cannot
come
to
the
american
--
was
what
we
are
seeking
is
a
protection
of
our
employment,
our
domestic
opportunities
to
give
us
an
economic
opportunity.
and
i
realize
that
lying
around
is
fine
but
we
are
also
cognizant,
equally
so,
of
repercussions.
we
recognize
that
congress
possesses
the
power,
if
it
sees
fit,
for
example,
recently
in
the
railway
labor
industry,
where
the
given
federal
right
to
strike
was
exercised
and
congress
recognizing
a
particular
situation,
moved
to
it,
and
passed
a
legislation
accordingly.
we're
not
engaging
in
that
conduct,
your
honor.
anymore
so
than
in
the
famous
court
everett
board
holding
in
the
exercise
of
the
section
13,
a
right
to
picket,
there
is
a
rippling
effect.
mr.
howard
schulman
oh!
i
would
say
the
--
they
would
not
be
substandard
but
not
be
truthful,
your
honor,
and
we've
got
to
have
truthful
picketing.
that's
the
direct
answer
to
that.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
would
say
we
--
i
don't
know
of
no
country,
i
would
say
we
enjoy
one
of
the
highest
standards
of
living
and
that's
why
we're
referring
to.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
think
it
is
a
fair
statement.
mr.
howard
schulman
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
howard
schulman
that's
an
assumption
i
would
not
accept
because
if
any
responsible
american
citizen
exercise
that
power,
that's
a
political
question
and
i
think
congress
would
move
to
the
issue
and
probably
so.
and
this
picketing
demonstrates
it,
your
honor,
contained
in
our
brief
as
the
port
of
houston
authority
case.
in
there,
the
court
refers
to
an
attempt
--
and
i'll
refer
to
very
shortly.
there
are
49
docks
in
that
harbor,
legions
of
ships.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
there
were
three
vessels
being
picketed,
that's
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor.
the
situation
comes
about
anymore
so
than
if
you
have
domestically,
in
the
united
states,
steel
mills
and
organized
steelworkers
stand
in
front
of
another
place
and
saying,
effect
to
them
that
their
standards
are
below.
this
argument
i
think,
is
analogous.
for
example,
then
you
could
have
no
more
steel
mills
unless
they
pay
those
prices.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
fundamental
argument
and
i
think,
fundamentally,
that
is
more
addressed
to
a
political
argument.
as
i
review
section
7,
congress
said,
and
it's
announced
in
this
court’s
benz
decision,
that
when
they
passed
the
act
they
gave
the
american
worker
rights
of
dignity,
an
economic
rights
to
be
exercised
here
in
the
united
states.
and
congress
has
taken
away
rights
when
the
exercise
has
become
extreme
and
people
act
irresponsibly
--
irresponsible.
there
is
nothing
in
this
case,
your
honor,
to
indicate
at
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
of
irresponsible
conduct
particularly
in
light
of
this
record
of
the
loss
of
employment
and
the
literal
fight
of
these
american
seamen
to
preserve
those
which
are
remaining.
that
is
the
issue
involved.
to
8
nth
degree.
yes,
of
course,
any
power
possessed
by
any
worker
in
the
united
states
in
the
combination
may
conceivably
lead
to
a
result
which
may
not
be
beneficial.
but,
is
that
not
an
issue
for
congress
to
determine
rather
than
a
question
for
our
judiciary
to
determine
if
that
occasion
never
arises.
it
has
not
arisen
and
that's
the
important
issue
here.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
would
say
the
issue
resides
where
there
is
the
greatest
degree
of
unemployment
and
(inaudible)
opportunities.
if
it
happens
to
be
in
a
particular
harbor,
like
in
mobile
where
there
are
legions
of
american
seamen
unemployed,
then
it
may
be
that
the
activity
may
take
place
frequently
there
and
perhaps
in
the
port
of
new
york
no
activity
because
of
unemployment
situations.
i
think
it's
no
different
than
you
have
what
we
refer
to
as
are
stand,
it's
picketing
in
the
united
states
unrelated
to
maritime.
where
does
that
take
place?
maybe
it's
down
the
south
where
there's
unorganized
people.
this
is
what
i'm
referring
to
and
in
our
case,
it
takes
place
in
instances
and
that's
what's
taken
place
but
there's
been
unemployment.
and
further
significant
to
that,
your
honor,
those
questions
have
been
raised
about
the
mobile
case.
number
one,
questions
have
been
set
--
raised
about
two
other
cases
appearing
in
the
government’s
amicus
brief
referred
to
and
one
in
wisconsin
and
one
in
minnesota.
and
in
all
those
instances,
the
court
pleases,
that
the
record
shows
some
people
cooperate
and
some
didn't.
some
longshoremen
worked
and
some
didn't
work,
and
that's
the
record.
what
i
am
saying
is
the
weighing
we
have
here,
as
i
view
it,
upon
the
one
hand,
the
right
of
american
seamen
is
a
federal
right
given
to
him.
we
were
not
excluded
as
a
class
from
section
7
rights.
congress
did
not
say
everyone
is
entitled
to
section
7
rights
except
american
seamen.
congress
gave
us
the
rights
like
everybody
else,
and
if
we're
going
to
be
excluded
let's
be
excluded
by
congress
where
we
have
an
opportunity
to
argue
the
merits
of
the
case.
let's
not
be
excluded
by
the
courts.
this
is
what
i
find
the
heart
of
the
issue
and
that's
taking
place,
as
i
see
it,
is
a
studied
attempt
by
these
interests
to
do
just
that,
take
away
our
section
7
rights
and
our
right
to
strike
and
protect
our
interests.
let
me
give
you
the
example
of
what
i'm
referring.
port
of
houston
authority
case
is
one
of
the
steps
they
did.
they
went
into
the
federal
court
in
houston
and
said
to
them,
“look,
you
are
going
to
make
an
exception
to
norris-la
guardia.
what
is
the
exception?
the
exception
is
international
treaties,
international
relations,
and
all
our
ports
will
be
tied
up.
district
court
and
the
circuit
unanimously
affirmed
and
this
court
denied
circuit
and
the
circuit
said,
“look,
don't
come
to
us
with
that.
go
to
congress.
come
and
see
what
the
second
step
is.”
they
didn't
turn
around
to
us
here
and
say,
“look,
we
have
articles,
ship’s
articles,
whatever
they're
referred.
they're
being
interfered
with.
we
want
to
export
that
law
into
your
jurisprudence
and
give
honor
to
that,”
and
this
court
(inaudible)
cases
said
“we
won't
do
that.
this
is
our
jurisdiction.”
now,
let's
move
to
the
third
area
of
what
they're
saying.
they're
then
saying
carve
out
an
exception
from
section
7.
everyone
in
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
section
7
rights
but
not
the
american
seamen.
carve
that
out
in
the
interest
of
international
relations.
then
they
hit
what
they
think
is
the
last
point
and
they
say
in
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1970,
congress
passed
some
legislation
to
help
the
american
seamen,
therefore,
that
should
be
justification,
an
implicit
repeal
of
section
7
rights.
and,
this
is
what
we
are
faced
with.
we
are
faced
with
the
rights
of
american
seamen.
we
have
done
good
service
as
american
cities
--
citizens
and
i
need
not
plea
that
right.
we've
lost
our
jobs.
we
have
come
to
the
only
place
we
can
come,
the
american
public.
you've
said
to
them,
“please
help
us.
here
is
the
truth
and
here
are
the
facts.”
this
is
what
we
think
we
have
a
fundamental
right
to
do
aside
from
constitutional
issues,
and
the
opposition
has
the
opportunity,
have
access
to
the
courts.
if
we're
engaging
in
conduct
of
the
trilogy
nature,
then
we
should
be
enjoined.
we
make
no
bones
about
it
and
we're
not.
in
fact,
we
want
to
austersize
these
vessels.
we
want
no
part
of
them.
really,
where
the
case
boils
down
to
in
the
final
analysis
is
do
american
seamen
have
section
7
rights
or
are
they
excluded?
i
don't
think
they're
excluded
and
i
don't
think
any
court,
not
jurisprudence
in
our
country
should
make
that
determination.
i
say
it
most
respectfully.
this
is
a
right
we
have
had
and
this
is
a
right,
if
we're
going
to
lose
it,
let's
lose
it
in
the
halls
of
congress
where
we
can
make
our
points.
yesterday,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
me
about
an
analogy
if
the
united
automobile
workers
put
up
a
picket
line
and
i
think
their
proper
association
of
that
is
follows.
assuming
volvo
move
their
factory
to
virginia
and
paid
the
substandard
wages,
i
think
united
automobile
workers
will
have
the
perfect
right
to
protect
it
and
that's
what's
happening
to
us.
they
are
moving,
these
factories
in
on
us
day
after
day
and
we
have
no
employment.
this
is
the
thrust
of
my
argument.
there
is
one
last
argument.
not
really
an
argument,
a
request
to
make
and
i
am
absolutely
embarrassed
to
make
it.
last
thursday,
i
came
to
my
office.
i
was
served
with
a
supplemental
memorandum
from
the
solicitor’s
office
as
amicus.
i
called
the
clerk’s
office
on
friday
to
protest
the
fact
that
i
know
no
provision
and
any
rules
for
this,
there
was
no
lead
made
to
this
court,
no
lead
was
granted
and
equally
significant
in
plain
fairness
and
fair
play
to
have
an
opportunity
to
reply.
directed
by
the
clerk
to
make
my
request
to
the
courts
to
find
unusual
in
circumstances.
and
my
press
request
is
just,
fundamentally,
either
that
that
supplemental
memorandum
be
rejected
as
not
following
the
rules
or
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
in
fairness
to
reply
to.
as
to
the
last
issue
on
the
case,
not
really
in
the
case,
the
issue
with
respect
to
our
constitutional
rights
to
picket.
that
was
not
tried
below
though
we
pleaded
it.
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
texas
courts
would
deny
us
our
constitutional
rights
but
we
do
believe,
however,
that
present
in
this
case
is
activity
which
has
found
by
the
court
below
falls
in
the
orchard,
as
i
call
it,
of
section
7
protected
activity
and
it's
section
7
act
protected
activity
which
is
actually
preempted
which
the
court
may
not
go
into.
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
to
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
of
course.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
i
am
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that's
essentially
political
arguments
contained
in
our
brief.
mr.
howard
schulman
no.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
there
was
no
authority.
this
was
filed
90
days
after
the
rules
provide.
mr.
howard
schulman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
howard
schulman
i’m
going
to
address
myself
if
i
can,
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
all
the
issues.
fundamentally,
there
is
no
disagreement
between
counsel
and
parties
here
that
the
conduct
engaged
by
the
respondents
here
is
normal,
typical,
protected
section
7
activity.
it
is
the
added
factor
that
the
vessel
which
was
involved
is
foreign.
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
that
because
i
think
it’s
how
you
approach
the
case.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
i
think
that’s
quite
significant
mr.
chief
justice.
american
seamen
as
every
other
american
worker
has
been
granted
a
section
7
right
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
benz
clearly.
and
what
these
seamen
are
doing
in
this
case
as
so
distinguished
from
benz
on
the
other
case
is
as
follows.
they're
saying
to
the
public
at
large,
“look,
we
were
90,000
seamen,
only
a
short
time
ago.
as
a
result
of
the
substandard
wages
and
conditions
we’re
down
to
30,000
people.
these
are
one
of
the
vessels.
we
don’t
want
to
represent
the
people.
we
don’t
want
to
aid
them.
we’re
not
seeking
organization.
we’re
not
seeking
to
apply
the
act.
what
we’re
asking
you,
the
public
is
ostracized
them
and
patronized
american
ships.”
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
because
i
think
in
that
particular
instance
mr.
chief
justice
you'd
have
a
secondary
boycott.
but
then
they
have
the
certain
right
to
publicize,
they
would
have
the
right
to
go
on
a
media
or
communication
as
we
did
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
to
hand
out
pamphlets
and
literature.
mr.
howard
schulman
well,
if
they
would
induce
a
neutral
then
obviously,
there’ll
be
a
secondary
boycott.
but
addressing
my
remarks
to
the
issues
here,
first
to
answer
some
of
the
inquiries
made
by
members
of
the
bench,
yes,
the
wage
rates
provided
in
this
vessel
which
is
substandard
are
found
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
$68.10
to
a
seaman
aboard
this
vessel
for
month’s
wages.
mr.
howard
schulman
thank
you.
mr.
howard
schulman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
of
the
--
just
before
the
recess
at
yesterday’s
session,
discussion
was
had
relative
to
the
wages
being
paid
the
seamen
aboard
these
foreign
vessels
and
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
only
purpose
of
that
is
to
show
the
truthfulness
of
the
picketing
pursuant
to
this
court’s
dictates
in
linn
versus
plant
guards.
the
underlying
issue
in
this
case,
as
we
see
it,
is
really
one
of
jurisdiction.
we
do
not
think
there's
an
issue
present
here
of
access
to
court,
but
one
of
applying
jurisdictional
standards.
as
we
see
it,
this
case
breaks
down
into
a
dichotomy
on
the
one
hand
of
what
we
refer
to
as
conduct
of
the
trilogy
nature,
meaning
the
benz,
incres,
and
mcculloch.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
present,
this
court’s
holdings
in
marine
cooks
and
panama
and
ariadne
as
to
whether
it
really
is
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights,
and
i'd
like
to
direct
my
attention
to
that
dichotomy.
it
is
clear
that
in
mcculloch,
benz,
and
incres
present
there
was
an
attempt
and
conduct
by
the
unions
to
organize,
represent,
in
effect,
be
the
statutory
bargaining
agent
for
the
people
aboard
that
--
those
vessels.
and
this
court,
in
ariadne,
summarized
that
conduct
in
the
holdings.
and,
contrary
to
what
my
friend
says,
the
--
there
are
only
certain
maritime
operations
of
a
foreign-flag
vessel
which
are
without
the
reach
of
a
statute
and
congress
never
intended
the
statute
to
be
applicable.
and
when
the
act
was
construed
in
the
trilogy
cases,
it
was
held
that
the
construction
they
have
sought
not
requested,
this
court
said,
would
necessitate
inquiry
into
the
internal
discipline
and
order
of
a
foreign
vessel.
and,
it
was
that
intervention
and
only
that
intervention,
that
this
court
felt
and
the
holdings
go,
would
bring
about
the
possible
conflict
in
international
law.
thus,
as
this
court
went
on
further
in
ariadne,
the
act
never
had
any
intention
to
cover
in
its
coverage
disputes
between
foreign
ships
and
their
foreign
crews.
that
is
what
is
referred
to
as
to
the
internal
order
and
discipline.
the
court
again,
referring
to
the
ariadne
case,
said,
“the
conduct,
there
present,
belied
any
intent
of
involvement
in
that
relationship
and
it
is
that
relationship
which
could
possibly
lead
to
the
conflict
with
foreign
or
international
law
and,
in
effect,
present
in
the
trilogy
cases
was
our
exporting
of
american
law
upon
the
vessel.
now
we
turn
to
the
other
part
of
the
dichotomy,
the
activity
of
american
citizens
here
in
the
united
states
and
the
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights
and,
that,
we
have
in
marine
panama
--
marine
cooks
versus
panama
and
in
ariadne.
in
those
cases,
we
have
american
citizens
saying
--
paraphrasing
as
follows,
“look,
we
have
had
employment
here
in
the
united
states
for
many,
many
years.
and
we
now
find
ourselves
in
a
terrible
situation
economically.
for
many
reasons,
truthful
reasons,
our
employment
has
been
taken
from
us
here.
right
here
in
new
york
harbor,
in
seattle
harbor,
in
san
francisco.
and
we
ask
you
as
fellow
citizens.
please
do
not
patronize
these
vessels
which,
we
are
truthfully
saying,
are
taking
our
employment.”
that's
section
7
rights
as
we
see
it
and
that
is
the
exercise
by
american
seamen,
as
a
class
of
working
people,
the
rights
to
which
they
are
entitled.
now
within
that
dichotomy,
and
that's
what
we're
faced
with,
the
state
court
has
the
jurisdiction.
as
this
state
court
below
did,
it
took
the
case
and
the
court
said,
“where
does
this
proverbial
apple
fall?
does
it
fall
within
the
trilogy
conduct
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
labor
board's
jurisdiction
as
mcculloch,
benz,
and
incres
hold
or
does
it
fall
on
the
other
side
of
the
orchard
which,
in
effect,
is
the
preservation
of
their
domestic
employment?”
the
court
made
the
decision.
the
court
concluded
that
the
conduct
engaged
here
was
not
trilogy
conduct
and
that,
under
those
circumstances,
having
exercised
jurisdiction
and
having
found
that
it
is
activities
to
protect
their
domestic
employment,
the
court
concluded
that
based
upon
this
court’s
decision
such
conduct
is
suggested
as
actually
protected
conduct
and
certainly
arguably
protected.
mr.
howard
schulman
no.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
the
message
--
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
if
we,
as
american
seamen,
have
our
employment
opportunities,
then
we
have
no
protest.
now,
but
what
we
are
seeking
is
our
american
opportunities.
to
give
a
classic
example,
yesterday,
in
reference
to
a
question
referred
to
my
friend,
he
mentioned
a
case
in
mobile,
alabama,
before
the
alabama
supreme
court.
and
in
that
case
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
while
these
people
were
protesting
for
their
loss
of
employment,
two
american
vessels
were
laid
up
looking
for
work.
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
not
seeking
under
any
circumstances,
to
tell
to
any
foreign
nation
that
they
cannot
come
to
the
american
--
was
what
we
are
seeking
is
a
protection
of
our
employment,
our
domestic
opportunities
to
give
us
an
economic
opportunity.
and
i
realize
that
lying
around
is
fine
but
we
are
also
cognizant,
equally
so,
of
repercussions.
we
recognize
that
congress
possesses
the
power,
if
it
sees
fit,
for
example,
recently
in
the
railway
labor
industry,
where
the
given
federal
right
to
strike
was
exercised
and
congress
recognizing
a
particular
situation,
moved
to
it,
and
passed
a
legislation
accordingly.
we're
not
engaging
in
that
conduct,
your
honor.
anymore
so
than
in
the
famous
court
everett
board
holding
in
the
exercise
of
the
section
13,
a
right
to
picket,
there
is
a
rippling
effect.
mr.
howard
schulman
oh!
i
would
say
the
--
they
would
not
be
substandard
but
not
be
truthful,
your
honor,
and
we've
got
to
have
truthful
picketing.
that's
the
direct
answer
to
that.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
would
say
we
--
i
don't
know
of
no
country,
i
would
say
we
enjoy
one
of
the
highest
standards
of
living
and
that's
why
we're
referring
to.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
think
it
is
a
fair
statement.
mr.
howard
schulman
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
howard
schulman
that's
an
assumption
i
would
not
accept
because
if
any
responsible
american
citizen
exercise
that
power,
that's
a
political
question
and
i
think
congress
would
move
to
the
issue
and
probably
so.
and
this
picketing
demonstrates
it,
your
honor,
contained
in
our
brief
as
the
port
of
houston
authority
case.
in
there,
the
court
refers
to
an
attempt
--
and
i'll
refer
to
very
shortly.
there
are
49
docks
in
that
harbor,
legions
of
ships.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
there
were
three
vessels
being
picketed,
that's
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor.
the
situation
comes
about
anymore
so
than
if
you
have
domestically,
in
the
united
states,
steel
mills
and
organized
steelworkers
stand
in
front
of
another
place
and
saying,
effect
to
them
that
their
standards
are
below.
this
argument
i
think,
is
analogous.
for
example,
then
you
could
have
no
more
steel
mills
unless
they
pay
those
prices.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
fundamental
argument
and
i
think,
fundamentally,
that
is
more
addressed
to
a
political
argument.
as
i
review
section
7,
congress
said,
and
it's
announced
in
this
court’s
benz
decision,
that
when
they
passed
the
act
they
gave
the
american
worker
rights
of
dignity,
an
economic
rights
to
be
exercised
here
in
the
united
states.
and
congress
has
taken
away
rights
when
the
exercise
has
become
extreme
and
people
act
irresponsibly
--
irresponsible.
there
is
nothing
in
this
case,
your
honor,
to
indicate
at
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
of
irresponsible
conduct
particularly
in
light
of
this
record
of
the
loss
of
employment
and
the
literal
fight
of
these
american
seamen
to
preserve
those
which
are
remaining.
that
is
the
issue
involved.
to
8
nth
degree.
yes,
of
course,
any
power
possessed
by
any
worker
in
the
united
states
in
the
combination
may
conceivably
lead
to
a
result
which
may
not
be
beneficial.
but,
is
that
not
an
issue
for
congress
to
determine
rather
than
a
question
for
our
judiciary
to
determine
if
that
occasion
never
arises.
it
has
not
arisen
and
that's
the
important
issue
here.
mr.
howard
schulman
i
would
say
the
issue
resides
where
there
is
the
greatest
degree
of
unemployment
and
(inaudible)
opportunities.
if
it
happens
to
be
in
a
particular
harbor,
like
in
mobile
where
there
are
legions
of
american
seamen
unemployed,
then
it
may
be
that
the
activity
may
take
place
frequently
there
and
perhaps
in
the
port
of
new
york
no
activity
because
of
unemployment
situations.
i
think
it's
no
different
than
you
have
what
we
refer
to
as
are
stand,
it's
picketing
in
the
united
states
unrelated
to
maritime.
where
does
that
take
place?
maybe
it's
down
the
south
where
there's
unorganized
people.
this
is
what
i'm
referring
to
and
in
our
case,
it
takes
place
in
instances
and
that's
what's
taken
place
but
there's
been
unemployment.
and
further
significant
to
that,
your
honor,
those
questions
have
been
raised
about
the
mobile
case.
number
one,
questions
have
been
set
--
raised
about
two
other
cases
appearing
in
the
government’s
amicus
brief
referred
to
and
one
in
wisconsin
and
one
in
minnesota.
and
in
all
those
instances,
the
court
pleases,
that
the
record
shows
some
people
cooperate
and
some
didn't.
some
longshoremen
worked
and
some
didn't
work,
and
that's
the
record.
what
i
am
saying
is
the
weighing
we
have
here,
as
i
view
it,
upon
the
one
hand,
the
right
of
american
seamen
is
a
federal
right
given
to
him.
we
were
not
excluded
as
a
class
from
section
7
rights.
congress
did
not
say
everyone
is
entitled
to
section
7
rights
except
american
seamen.
congress
gave
us
the
rights
like
everybody
else,
and
if
we're
going
to
be
excluded
let's
be
excluded
by
congress
where
we
have
an
opportunity
to
argue
the
merits
of
the
case.
let's
not
be
excluded
by
the
courts.
this
is
what
i
find
the
heart
of
the
issue
and
that's
taking
place,
as
i
see
it,
is
a
studied
attempt
by
these
interests
to
do
just
that,
take
away
our
section
7
rights
and
our
right
to
strike
and
protect
our
interests.
let
me
give
you
the
example
of
what
i'm
referring.
port
of
houston
authority
case
is
one
of
the
steps
they
did.
they
went
into
the
federal
court
in
houston
and
said
to
them,
“look,
you
are
going
to
make
an
exception
to
norris-la
guardia.
what
is
the
exception?
the
exception
is
international
treaties,
international
relations,
and
all
our
ports
will
be
tied
up.
district
court
and
the
circuit
unanimously
affirmed
and
this
court
denied
circuit
and
the
circuit
said,
“look,
don't
come
to
us
with
that.
go
to
congress.
come
and
see
what
the
second
step
is.”
they
didn't
turn
around
to
us
here
and
say,
“look,
we
have
articles,
ship’s
articles,
whatever
they're
referred.
they're
being
interfered
with.
we
want
to
export
that
law
into
your
jurisprudence
and
give
honor
to
that,”
and
this
court
(inaudible)
cases
said
“we
won't
do
that.
this
is
our
jurisdiction.”
now,
let's
move
to
the
third
area
of
what
they're
saying.
they're
then
saying
carve
out
an
exception
from
section
7.
everyone
in
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
section
7
rights
but
not
the
american
seamen.
carve
that
out
in
the
interest
of
international
relations.
then
they
hit
what
they
think
is
the
last
point
and
they
say
in
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1970,
congress
passed
some
legislation
to
help
the
american
seamen,
therefore,
that
should
be
justification,
an
implicit
repeal
of
section
7
rights.
and,
this
is
what
we
are
faced
with.
we
are
faced
with
the
rights
of
american
seamen.
we
have
done
good
service
as
american
cities
--
citizens
and
i
need
not
plea
that
right.
we've
lost
our
jobs.
we
have
come
to
the
only
place
we
can
come,
the
american
public.
you've
said
to
them,
“please
help
us.
here
is
the
truth
and
here
are
the
facts.”
this
is
what
we
think
we
have
a
fundamental
right
to
do
aside
from
constitutional
issues,
and
the
opposition
has
the
opportunity,
have
access
to
the
courts.
if
we're
engaging
in
conduct
of
the
trilogy
nature,
then
we
should
be
enjoined.
we
make
no
bones
about
it
and
we're
not.
in
fact,
we
want
to
austersize
these
vessels.
we
want
no
part
of
them.
really,
where
the
case
boils
down
to
in
the
final
analysis
is
do
american
seamen
have
section
7
rights
or
are
they
excluded?
i
don't
think
they're
excluded
and
i
don't
think
any
court,
not
jurisprudence
in
our
country
should
make
that
determination.
i
say
it
most
respectfully.
this
is
a
right
we
have
had
and
this
is
a
right,
if
we're
going
to
lose
it,
let's
lose
it
in
the
halls
of
congress
where
we
can
make
our
points.
yesterday,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
me
about
an
analogy
if
the
united
automobile
workers
put
up
a
picket
line
and
i
think
their
proper
association
of
that
is
follows.
assuming
volvo
move
their
factory
to
virginia
and
paid
the
substandard
wages,
i
think
united
automobile
workers
will
have
the
perfect
right
to
protect
it
and
that's
what's
happening
to
us.
they
are
moving,
these
factories
in
on
us
day
after
day
and
we
have
no
employment.
this
is
the
thrust
of
my
argument.
there
is
one
last
argument.
not
really
an
argument,
a
request
to
make
and
i
am
absolutely
embarrassed
to
make
it.
last
thursday,
i
came
to
my
office.
i
was
served
with
a
supplemental
memorandum
from
the
solicitor’s
office
as
amicus.
i
called
the
clerk’s
office
on
friday
to
protest
the
fact
that
i
know
no
provision
and
any
rules
for
this,
there
was
no
lead
made
to
this
court,
no
lead
was
granted
and
equally
significant
in
plain
fairness
and
fair
play
to
have
an
opportunity
to
reply.
directed
by
the
clerk
to
make
my
request
to
the
courts
to
find
unusual
in
circumstances.
and
my
press
request
is
just,
fundamentally,
either
that
that
supplemental
memorandum
be
rejected
as
not
following
the
rules
or
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
in
fairness
to
reply
to.
as
to
the
last
issue
on
the
case,
not
really
in
the
case,
the
issue
with
respect
to
our
constitutional
rights
to
picket.
that
was
not
tried
below
though
we
pleaded
it.
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
texas
courts
would
deny
us
our
constitutional
rights
but
we
do
believe,
however,
that
present
in
this
case
is
activity
which
has
found
by
the
court
below
falls
in
the
orchard,
as
i
call
it,
of
section
7
protected
activity
and
it's
section
7
act
protected
activity
which
is
actually
preempted
which
the
court
may
not
go
into.
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
to
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
of
course.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
i
am
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that's
essentially
political
arguments
contained
in
our
brief.
mr.
howard
schulman
no.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
there
was
no
authority.
this
was
filed
90
days
after
the
rules
provide.
