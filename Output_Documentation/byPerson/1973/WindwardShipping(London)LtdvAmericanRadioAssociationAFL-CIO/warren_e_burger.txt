against

mr.
ogden,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
any
local
labor
involved
in
the
loading
or
unloading?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
longshoreman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
trying
to
flush
out
the
comparison
with
the
ariadne
case,
i
think
it
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
never
reached
the
point
of
using
local
longshoreman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
the
pay
received
by
the
crews
of
this
ship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
us
about
that
a
little.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
anything
in
the
record
about
their
cost
of
living
at
their
home
port?
or
where
would
they
live?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
actually,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
have
consumed
all
of
your
time.
mr.
schulman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it’s
a
little
more
than
that
unless
you
mean
by
foreign
that
--
by
virtue
of
its
foreign
flag,
it
has
no
american
--
no
seamen
aboard
who
are
being
paid
with
american
standard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
united
automobile
workers
have
the
same
right
to
picket
the
docks
if
they
were
unloading
volkswagens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
picket,
is
that
your
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
pick
that
point
the
first
thing
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
arguments
in
windward
shipping
against
american
radio
association.
mr.
schulman,
you
have
27
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
spoken,
mr.
schulman,
of
the
message
that
picketers
were
undertaking
to
give
to
americans,
that
is,
“don't
try
to
--
don't
patronize
these
people.”
but,
the
--
is
there
--
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
there
is
another
message
involved
here
to
foreign-flag
ships,
that
is,
“conform
to
american
standards
or
keep
out
of
our
ports”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
other
message?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
conform
to
american
standards,
you
would
then
--
are
you
saying
that
you
then
have
no
basis
for
picketing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
get
back
to
my
question.
if
the
foreign
ships
in
question
met
american
standards,
do
you
say,
do
you
conceive
that
you
would
not
have
any
right
to
picket
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
--
then
from
that,
on
the
basis
of
what
either
what
you
said
yesterday
or
perhaps
what
your
friend
said,
would
you
say
that
it
is
a
fact
that
no
country
in
the
world,
having
maritime
activity
meets
our
standards,
are
paid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
almost
so
widely
recognized
in
maritime
circles
that
it
would
be
judicially
noticed
that
if
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
one
--
no
country
in
the
world
matches
our
standard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
that
means
that
no
ships
of
any
country
in
the
world
can
come
into
our
ports
free
of
this
kind
of
demonstration,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
now
you're
talking
about
the
economics
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
decides
now
which
foreign-flag
ships
are
to
be
picketed
and
which
ones
are
not
to
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
schulman,
if
you
would
like
to
respond,
you
may
do
so
in
a
week
or
10
days,
of
course
sending
a
copy
to
your
friend.
