mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
by
the
miami
herald
from
a
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
which
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
section
104.38
florida
statutes.
this
appeal
involves
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
on
its
face
under
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
this
statute
involves
the
question
of
whether
a
newspaper
under
the
first
amendment
may
be
compelled
by
the
florida
legislature,
to
print
the
political
statement
of
a
candidate
which
it
does
not
desire
to
print.
the
facts
of
this
case
arose
when
the
appellee,
mr.
tornillo
became
a
candidate
from
dade
county
for
the
florida
legislature
in
the
1972
state
elections.
in
1913,
the
florida
legislature
had
enacted
a
criminal
statute,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
in
full
at
the
top
of
page
47.
that
statute
requires
a
newspaper
to
give
a
political
candidate,
free
space
to
reply
to
any
criticism
of
the
political
candidate
published
by
a
newspaper.
statute
on
its
face
applies
to
criticism
of
a
candidate
whether
published
in
news
articles,
columns
or
editorials.
the
truthfulness
or
fairness
of
the
criticism
is
irrelevant
under
the
statute
and
the
violation
of
that
statute
is
the
crime
punishable
by
up
to
one
year
in
jail
and
a
fine
up
to
$1,000.00.
there
is
no
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
it
was
adopted
as
a
part
of
the
states
corrupt
practices
and
elections
act
and
there’s
no
record
of
it’s
use
for
almost
60
years.
its
first
judicial
test
was
in
1972
in
state
versus
news
journal.
in
that
case
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
i
think
the
statute
actually
is
broader
because
the
definition
of
candidate
includes
a
person
who
qualifies,
a
person
who
is
already
in
all
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes,
the
florida
supreme
court
in
interpreting
this
statute
in
this
case,
said
that
it
applied
to
editorials
and
other
articles.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
no,
he
was
a
candidate
for
an
office
in
state
legislature.
in
the
first
judicial
test
of
this
statute
in
florida
courts
in
1972
in
state
versus
news
journal,
the
mayor
of
daytona
beach
had
the
newspaper
arrested
for
refusing
to
print
the
mayor’s
reply
to
an
article
critical
of
the
mayor.
the
lower
court
held
the
statute
violated
free
press
and
due
process
guarantees
of
the
u.s.
in
the
florida
constitutions
and
dismissed
the
criminal
proceedings,
that
decision
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
at
page
51.
at
that
time,
the
florida
attorney
general
conceded
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
and
refused
to
appeal
the
decision.
mr.
tornillo
became
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
some
seven
months
later.
that
election
was
scheduled
for
october
4,
1972.
on
september
20,
seven
--
14
days
before
that
election,
the
herald
printed
an
editorial
critical
of
mr.
tornillo’s
candidacy,
that
editorial
appears
at
page
5
of
the
appendix.
it
referred
to
mr.
tornillo,
criticizing
his
opponent
for
violating
the
election
law.
the
editorial
pointed
out
that
mr.
tornillo
was
the
same
one,
who
had
led
an
illegal
teachers’
strike
and
the
editorial
concluded
by
saying
it
would
be
inexcusable
if
the
voters
elected
mr.
tornillo
to
the
legislature.
mr.
tornillo
waited
a
week
and
on
september
27,
submitted
a
statement
he
entitled,
“pat
tornillo
in
the
cta
record.”
he
demanded
that
the
herald
print
that
statement,
pursuant
to
the
florida
statute,
which
carries
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
tornillo
in
his
statement
did
not
claim
that
the
editorial
was
not
truthful
and
he
did
not
seek
a
retraction
under
the
florida
retraction
statute.
he
claimed
that
the
herald
was
dwelling
on
past
history
and
he
listed
his
own
accomplishments
during
the
past
four
years.
the
herald
did
not
print
that
statement
of
candidate
tornillo.
the
herald
printed
a
second
editorial
on
september
29,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
page
8.
mr.
tornillo
submitted
a
second
statement
the
next
day
and
demanded
that
it'd
be
printed,
that
statement
appears
at
page
10.
again,
there
was
no
claim
that
the
editorial
was
false.
the
herald
did
not
print
mr.
tornillo’s
statement.
the
next
day
on
october
1,
mr.
tornillo
filed
suit
in
the
dade
county
circuit
court,
seeking
actual
and
punitive
damages
and
a
mandatory
injunction
to
print
his
two
statements.
in
his
complaint,
mr.
tornillo
alleged
that
by
this
florida
statute,
florida
had
established
“a
fairness
doctrine”
in
enacting
this
compulsory
publication
statute.
at
mr.
tornillo’s
request
an
emergency
hearing
was
held
in
the
next
day,
october
2.
the
florida
attorney
general
was
present,
since
a
statute
of
the
state's
constitutionality
would
be
questioned
and
he
advised
the
court
that
he
would
not
defend
the
statute
as
he
had
done
in
prior
case
involving
the
daytona
beach
news
journal.
the
court
denied
mr.
tornillo’s
request
for
an
injunction
and
declared
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
violated
the
first
amendment
and
the
due
process
guarantees
of
the
constitution.
mr.
tornillo
then
advised
the
court
that
he
elected
not
to
proceed
further
in
that
case
and
the
case
therefore
dismissed
with
prejudice.
mr.
tornillo
appealed
directly
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
on
july
10
of
this
year
in
a
per
curiam
opinion,
one
justice
dissenting,
the
florida
supreme
court
reversed
the
lower
court
and
held
the
statute
did
not
violate
either
the
first
or
the
fourteenth
amendments
or
the
due
process
guarantees
of
the
constitution,
that
opinion
of
the
florida
court
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
15.
a
rehearing
was
denied
in
a
second
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
florida
supreme
court
on
october
10,
which
is
also
in
the
appendix.
the
herald
appealed
directly
to
this
court.
on
january
14,
the
court
agreed
to
hear
this
appeal
on
the
merits,
postponing
decisions
on
appellee’s
jurisdictional
claim
until
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
appellee
has
subsequently
abandoned
his
claim
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal.
the
florida
statute
that
is
before
the
court
today
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes,
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
there
was
no
injunction
remedy
under
the
statute,
but
they
did
imply,
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
a
criminal
statute,
a
right
for
civil
damages.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes
i
think
that
the
florida
supreme
court
in
that
opinion
specifically
said
that
the
fact
that
this
was
a
criminal
statute
did
not
mean
a
civil
right
could
not
be
implied
in
that
decision.
it
appears
in
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion.
i
don’t
have
the
page
right,
it
end
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
it's
page
40,
i
believe
in
the
appendix,
that
particular
statement,
39
or
40.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
criminal
penalty
can
easily
be
severed
and
deleted
and
still
leave
a
complete
legislative
expression
establishing
a
civil
right
to
damage,
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
page40.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
no,
i
--
the
court
of
course
has
to
examine
that
question,
i
think
though
that
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
constitutionality
on
its
face
of
the
florida
statute
and
that
issue
has
been
fully
litigated
in
the
florida
courts.
there
are
no
non-constitutional
issues
remaining
in
this
case,
and
the
constitutional
issue
is
ripe
for
determination.
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
no,
the
paper
does
not
concede
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
the
remaining
issues
would
be
issues
solely
of
florida
law
as
to
the
remedy
and
as
to
the
amount
or
damage.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
that
possibility
is
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
i
think
though
under
the
principles
lay
down
by
this
court
in
mills
versus
alabama,
this
constitutional
question
is
now
ripe
for
decision
and
threatens
basic
first
amendment
rights,
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
holding
the
statute
constitution
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
finally
settled
in
the
florida
courts
and
florida
election
scheduled
within
a
few
months
and
this
statute
would
seriously
inhibit
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
in
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
would
deter
the
exercise
of
those
rights.
and
i
think
under
the
principles
laid
down
in
mills
versus
alabama,
this
case
is
ripe
for
decision.
to
sanction
the
florida
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
except
that
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
from
point
of
view
of
inhibiting
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
in
florida
would
still
stand,
even
if
the
non-constitutional
issues
should
provide
success
for
the
miami
herald
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
the
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
the
florida
supreme
court
has
held
the
statute
constitutional
and
of
course
the
herald
would,
in
the
absence
of
the
reversal
by
this
court,
would
have
to
abide
by
the
constitutional
ruling
of
the
highest
court
in
its
state.
it
would
therefore
vitally
affect
not
only
the
herald’s
rights,
but
many
other
newspapers
rights
in
florida
who
would
be
guided
by
that
decision
in
the
exercise
of
their
editorial
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
print
the
replies
of
political
candidates.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
mills
versus
alabama,
it’s
not
necessary
that
the
non-constitutional
issues
remaining
in
the
case,
all
be
resolved
when
the
decision
of
the
state
court
inhibits
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
and
to
sanction
the
florida
statute,
this
court
would
have
to
make
a
fundamental
revision
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
correct,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
no,
it
was
not
a
first
amendment
case.
of
course,
again,
it
seems
really
an
exercise
in
futility
to
send
this
case
back
to
decide
the
non-constitutional
issues
and
then
have
it
wind
its
way
back
in
a
long
and
tortuous
process,
from
the
constitutional
issue,
which
obviously
in
the
light
of
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
will
have
to
be
decided.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
this
case
wouldn’t,
but
another
case
raising
the
same
issue
would
come
back
because
the
florida
supreme
court’s
decision
would
still
stand.
we
would
not
win
on
the
basis
of
non-constitutional
or
constitutional
rights
and
i
think
that
that
issue
will
inhibit
the
exercise
of
those
rights
in
florida
until
it
is
settled.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes,
i
think
we
might
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes.
compelling
a
newspaper
to
print
is
the
same
as
telling
it
what
not
to
print.
it
is
censorship
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment.
there
is
a
national
policy
that
has
been
expressed
in
the
first
amendment,
that
newspapers
should
not
be
deterred
in
printing
what
they
choose
particularly
about
political
candidates.
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
the
cbs
case,
the
first
amendment
protects
newspapers
from
the
intrusive
editorial
form
of
government.
if
there
is
any
area
where
the
role
of
the
press
under
the
first
amendment
must
remain
unfettered,
it
is
criticism
of
political
candidates
of
the
very
kind
expressed
in
this
case.
one
of
the
chief
roles
of
the
press
is
vigorous
criticism
of
candidates
and
the
public
officials.
newspapers
historically
in
this
country
have
been
in
the
business
of
grinding
access
and
particularly
political
ones.
editorial
discretion
and
judgment
must
mean
freedom
to
choose
what
to
print
and
what
not
to
print.
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
pointed
out
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
case,
editors
are
editing
is
what
editors
are
for
and
editing
is
selection
and
choice
of
material.
the
only
restrains
on
the
autonomy
of
the
press,
which
this
court
sanctioned
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
case
in
its
non-business
aspect,s
are
the
restraints
imposed
by
its
readers
and
by
its
journalistic
integrity.
the
attempts
at
regulation
of
fairness
or
balance
of
newspapers
strikes
at
the
very
core
of
the
first
amendment.
as
professor
barren
concedes
in
his
writings,
it
would
lead
to
the
press
being
treated
as
a
public
utility
and
licensing
of
the
press
would
be
the
result.
there
would
be
a
return
to
the
conditions,
which
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
first
amendment
to
begin
with.
freedom
of
the
press,
not
fairness
is
what
the
first
amendment
is
concerned
with.
fairness
has
been
left
to
the
editors.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
the
cbs
case,
fairness
is
too
fragile
a
commodity
to
be
left
to
the
government
to
decide.
although
the
florida
statute
is
vague
and
ambiguous,
it
is
certainly
broad
in
scope.
it
may
be
invoked
by
any
candidate,
who
has
filed
for
local,
state
or
federal
law
office.
in
fact,
it
may
be
invoked
by
an
incumbent
public
official,
as
soon
as
he
qualifies
for
reelection
and
becomes
a
candidate.
it
applies
to
any
criticism
of
the
candidate
published
in
the
newspaper.
it
is
not
limited
to
editorial
criticism.
it
applies
at
the
very
least,
to
news
articles,
to
syndicated
columns,
to
cartoons.
in
fact
the
statute
could
be
triggered
by
a
news
article
in
which
one
candidate
assails
another.
a
reply
is
demanded
and
the
other
candidate
demands
a
counter
reply
and
the
entire
round-robin
ad
infinitum
could
be
setup
in
the
newspaper.
one
article
which
criticized
several
candidates
would
trigger
as
many
replies,
as
there
were
candidates
criticized.
each
under
the
statute
would
be
entitled
to
his
separate
reply.
it
would
apply
to
newspapers
whether
or
not
they
were
published
in
florida.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
under
the
florida
statute,
each
of
the
candidates
would
have
an
answer.
a
new
york
times
story
for
example,
on
florida
politics,
would
trigger
the
statute
and
the
new
york
times
under
penalty
of
criminal
sanctions
would
be
required
to
accept
replies
of
florida
candidates.
and
again,
i
emphasize
that
this
statute
applies
without
regard
to
the
true
or
the
falsity
or
the
fairness
of
the
original
article,
regardless
of
whether
there
was
any
malice
involved.
in
fact
this
statute
stands
the
libel
standards
of
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
on
its
head.
newspapers
which
publish
something
which
is
true
may
be
required
to
publish
a
totally
false
reply.
as
i
said,
statute
carries
criminal
penalties.
the
editor
can
be
put
in
jail
for
up
to
a
year
and
fined
a
thousand
dollars
in
addition
to
the
civil
remedies,
which
have
been
implied
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
now
the
appellee
seeks
to
justify
this
sweeping
incursion
on
the
first
amendment
on
the
ground
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
fair
elections
and
that
this
justifies
abridgment.
we
submit
that
such
an
argument
ignores
this
court’s
holding
in
mills
versus
alabama,
which
interestingly
is
not
cited
in
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
or
in
the
appellee’s
briefs.
in
the
mills
case,
it
was
argued
in
defense
of
that
alabama
statute
that
purity
of
elections,
justified
this
ever
so
slight,
abridgment
of
the
first
amendment
made
by
the
statute,
not
to
publish
any
critical
of
a
candidate
on
election
day.
nevertheless
the
court
struck
that
statute
down
on
the
ground
that
the
state's
interest
in
fair
elections
could
not
justify
an
abridgment
of
the
first
amendment.
secondly,
we
are
told
by
appellee
that
the
statute
is
justified
by
the
economic
concentration
of
the
media.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
justify
appellee’s
argument
that
the
media
is
now
one
vast
monolith.
the
facts
are,
that
there
is
much
more
diversity
in
the
media
and
in
the
number
of
media,
than
at
the
time
the
first
amendment
was
adopted.
but
again,
the
court
has
found
in
the
associated
press
case
that
even
antitrust
violations
do
not
justify
infringement
of
the
first
amendment.
of
course,
the
press
has
power.
it’s
obvious
that
the
press
has
to
have
power
to
assure
its
editorial
independence
and
to
assure
that
it
can
fulfill
its
role
under
the
first
amendment.
interestingly
enough,
the
argument
made
in
this
case
for
this
statute
and
the
benefits
it
theoretically
would
provide,
the
statute
would
have
exactly
the
opposite
effect.
newspapers,
particularly
small
ones,
with
space
limitations
would
be
deterred
in
publishing
political
criticism
for
fear
of
triggering
the
statute.
publications
for
example
with
the
distinct
editorial
viewpoints
would
have
the
greatest
dilemma
of
all.
will
the
12
black
newspapers,
serving
the
black
community
in
florida
have
to
give
equal
time
to
george
wallace
to
reply
as
a
candidate,
despite
the
views
of
the
particular
editor
of
that
newspaper
in
the
community
which
it
serves?
there
are
many
other
examples
but
we
submit
that
an
examination
of
this
statute
on
its
face
dictates
that
the
opinion
of
the
florida
supreme
court
must
be
reversed.
i
should
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
briefly,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
two
misstatements
by
professor
barron
in
reference
to
the
statute.
he
refers
to
the
statute
as
applying
only
to
criticism
published
in
a
newspaper
published
in
the
same
community
where
the
candidate
is.
there
is
no
such
limitation
in
the
statute.
as
i
said
it
would
apply
to
the
new
york
times
if
it
happens
to
publish
something
about
a
particular
florida
election
and
the
candidates
involved.
and
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
the
criminal
penalty
can
be
detached
from
the
statute.
the
florida
supreme
court
has
let
the
criminal
penalty
standing,
but
there
is
no
way
that
any
candidate
can
get
a
reply
under
this
statute
by
any
other
way
than
the
criminal
penalty
because
the
florida
supreme
court
has
knocked
out
the
mandatory
injunction
penalty,
on
the
old
common
law
theory
that
equity
will
enjoin
a
crime,
a
rule
which
is
followed
in
florida.
so
without
the
criminal
penalty
this
would
not
provoke
any
reply.
mr.
barron
keeps
talking
about
mr.
tornillo
being
censored
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
any
such
assertion
that
mr.
tornillo
did
not
get
his
message
across.
mr.
barron
describes
mr.
tornillo
as
a
public
figure
and
as
a
controversial
man.
we
would
have
to
be
very
naive
to
think
that
mr.
tornillo
was
relying
entirely
on
a
paragraph
statement
in
the
miami
herald
in
order
to
get
his
message
across
in
his
campaign.
there
is
nothing
that
shows
that
he
was
muzzled,
but
i
think
de
novo
it
comes
down
to
the
concluding
remarks
that
professor
barron
made
when
he
says
that
this
case
poses
compete
--
competing
first
amendment
interest
in
conflict.
there
are
no
competing
first
amendment
interests
in
conflict
here.
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
to
use
the
press.
there
is
no
right
of
a
citizen
to
be
interviewed
by
the
press.
there
is
no
right
to
have
a
letter
that
a
citizen
may
write
to
the
press
to
have
that
letter
printed.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
it
out
yesterday
in
the
prison
cases,
the
editor
might
just
as
well
throw
that
letter
in
the
waste
basket
if
he
determines
that
he
does
not
desire
to
print
it.
a
judicial
inquiry
into
the
editorial
discretion
and
the
editorial
function
is
not
permissible
under
the
first
amendment.
compulsion
is
the
same
as
censorship
and
there
is
no
difference
between
saying
that
you
shall
publish
and
you
shall
not
publish
under
the
first
amendment.
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
it
out,
our
founding
fathers
in
writing
the
first
amendment
opted
for
a
free
press,
not
a
fair
press.
they
decided
fairness
was
too
fragile
an
issue
for
them
to
deal
with.
it
is
the
only
first
amendment
we
have
as
pointed
it
out
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
case
and
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
court
to
rewrite
that
amendment.
the
issue
is
really
who
decides
what
gets
in
to
the
newspaper?
the
government,
the
florida
legislature
or
the
editor
of
the
free
newspaper.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
the
florida
legislature
to
regulate
the
fairness
of
political
criticism
without
violating
the
first
amendment.
i
understand
that
professor
barron
says
this
is
a
noble
concept,
but
motherhood
is,
as
one
editor
pointed
out,
also
a
noble
condition.
but
motherhood
under
compulsion
is
the
product
of
rape
and
it
begets
illegitimacy
and
to
force
an
editor
to
print
in
his
editorial
judgment
what
he
does
not
desire
and
his
conscience
does
not
wish
to
print
or
he
may
think
is
not
true
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
by
the
miami
herald
from
a
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
which
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
section
104.38
florida
statutes.
this
appeal
involves
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
on
its
face
under
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
this
statute
involves
the
question
of
whether
a
newspaper
under
the
first
amendment
may
be
compelled
by
the
florida
legislature,
to
print
the
political
statement
of
a
candidate
which
it
does
not
desire
to
print.
the
facts
of
this
case
arose
when
the
appellee,
mr.
tornillo
became
a
candidate
from
dade
county
for
the
florida
legislature
in
the
1972
state
elections.
in
1913,
the
florida
legislature
had
enacted
a
criminal
statute,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
in
full
at
the
top
of
page
47.
that
statute
requires
a
newspaper
to
give
a
political
candidate,
free
space
to
reply
to
any
criticism
of
the
political
candidate
published
by
a
newspaper.
statute
on
its
face
applies
to
criticism
of
a
candidate
whether
published
in
news
articles,
columns
or
editorials.
the
truthfulness
or
fairness
of
the
criticism
is
irrelevant
under
the
statute
and
the
violation
of
that
statute
is
the
crime
punishable
by
up
to
one
year
in
jail
and
a
fine
up
to
$1,000.00.
there
is
no
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
it
was
adopted
as
a
part
of
the
states
corrupt
practices
and
elections
act
and
there’s
no
record
of
it’s
use
for
almost
60
years.
its
first
judicial
test
was
in
1972
in
state
versus
news
journal.
in
that
case
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
i
think
the
statute
actually
is
broader
because
the
definition
of
candidate
includes
a
person
who
qualifies,
a
person
who
is
already
in
all
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes,
the
florida
supreme
court
in
interpreting
this
statute
in
this
case,
said
that
it
applied
to
editorials
and
other
articles.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
no,
he
was
a
candidate
for
an
office
in
state
legislature.
in
the
first
judicial
test
of
this
statute
in
florida
courts
in
1972
in
state
versus
news
journal,
the
mayor
of
daytona
beach
had
the
newspaper
arrested
for
refusing
to
print
the
mayor’s
reply
to
an
article
critical
of
the
mayor.
the
lower
court
held
the
statute
violated
free
press
and
due
process
guarantees
of
the
u.s.
in
the
florida
constitutions
and
dismissed
the
criminal
proceedings,
that
decision
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
at
page
51.
at
that
time,
the
florida
attorney
general
conceded
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
and
refused
to
appeal
the
decision.
mr.
tornillo
became
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
some
seven
months
later.
that
election
was
scheduled
for
october
4,
1972.
on
september
20,
seven
--
14
days
before
that
election,
the
herald
printed
an
editorial
critical
of
mr.
tornillo’s
candidacy,
that
editorial
appears
at
page
5
of
the
appendix.
it
referred
to
mr.
tornillo,
criticizing
his
opponent
for
violating
the
election
law.
the
editorial
pointed
out
that
mr.
tornillo
was
the
same
one,
who
had
led
an
illegal
teachers’
strike
and
the
editorial
concluded
by
saying
it
would
be
inexcusable
if
the
voters
elected
mr.
tornillo
to
the
legislature.
mr.
tornillo
waited
a
week
and
on
september
27,
submitted
a
statement
he
entitled,
“pat
tornillo
in
the
cta
record.”
he
demanded
that
the
herald
print
that
statement,
pursuant
to
the
florida
statute,
which
carries
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
tornillo
in
his
statement
did
not
claim
that
the
editorial
was
not
truthful
and
he
did
not
seek
a
retraction
under
the
florida
retraction
statute.
he
claimed
that
the
herald
was
dwelling
on
past
history
and
he
listed
his
own
accomplishments
during
the
past
four
years.
the
herald
did
not
print
that
statement
of
candidate
tornillo.
the
herald
printed
a
second
editorial
on
september
29,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
page
8.
mr.
tornillo
submitted
a
second
statement
the
next
day
and
demanded
that
it'd
be
printed,
that
statement
appears
at
page
10.
again,
there
was
no
claim
that
the
editorial
was
false.
the
herald
did
not
print
mr.
tornillo’s
statement.
the
next
day
on
october
1,
mr.
tornillo
filed
suit
in
the
dade
county
circuit
court,
seeking
actual
and
punitive
damages
and
a
mandatory
injunction
to
print
his
two
statements.
in
his
complaint,
mr.
tornillo
alleged
that
by
this
florida
statute,
florida
had
established
“a
fairness
doctrine”
in
enacting
this
compulsory
publication
statute.
at
mr.
tornillo’s
request
an
emergency
hearing
was
held
in
the
next
day,
october
2.
the
florida
attorney
general
was
present,
since
a
statute
of
the
state's
constitutionality
would
be
questioned
and
he
advised
the
court
that
he
would
not
defend
the
statute
as
he
had
done
in
prior
case
involving
the
daytona
beach
news
journal.
the
court
denied
mr.
tornillo’s
request
for
an
injunction
and
declared
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
violated
the
first
amendment
and
the
due
process
guarantees
of
the
constitution.
mr.
tornillo
then
advised
the
court
that
he
elected
not
to
proceed
further
in
that
case
and
the
case
therefore
dismissed
with
prejudice.
mr.
tornillo
appealed
directly
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
on
july
10
of
this
year
in
a
per
curiam
opinion,
one
justice
dissenting,
the
florida
supreme
court
reversed
the
lower
court
and
held
the
statute
did
not
violate
either
the
first
or
the
fourteenth
amendments
or
the
due
process
guarantees
of
the
constitution,
that
opinion
of
the
florida
court
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
15.
a
rehearing
was
denied
in
a
second
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
florida
supreme
court
on
october
10,
which
is
also
in
the
appendix.
the
herald
appealed
directly
to
this
court.
on
january
14,
the
court
agreed
to
hear
this
appeal
on
the
merits,
postponing
decisions
on
appellee’s
jurisdictional
claim
until
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
appellee
has
subsequently
abandoned
his
claim
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal.
the
florida
statute
that
is
before
the
court
today
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes,
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
there
was
no
injunction
remedy
under
the
statute,
but
they
did
imply,
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
a
criminal
statute,
a
right
for
civil
damages.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes
i
think
that
the
florida
supreme
court
in
that
opinion
specifically
said
that
the
fact
that
this
was
a
criminal
statute
did
not
mean
a
civil
right
could
not
be
implied
in
that
decision.
it
appears
in
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion.
i
don’t
have
the
page
right,
it
end
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
it's
page
40,
i
believe
in
the
appendix,
that
particular
statement,
39
or
40.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
criminal
penalty
can
easily
be
severed
and
deleted
and
still
leave
a
complete
legislative
expression
establishing
a
civil
right
to
damage,
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
page40.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
no,
i
--
the
court
of
course
has
to
examine
that
question,
i
think
though
that
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
constitutionality
on
its
face
of
the
florida
statute
and
that
issue
has
been
fully
litigated
in
the
florida
courts.
there
are
no
non-constitutional
issues
remaining
in
this
case,
and
the
constitutional
issue
is
ripe
for
determination.
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
no,
the
paper
does
not
concede
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
the
remaining
issues
would
be
issues
solely
of
florida
law
as
to
the
remedy
and
as
to
the
amount
or
damage.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
that
possibility
is
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
i
think
though
under
the
principles
lay
down
by
this
court
in
mills
versus
alabama,
this
constitutional
question
is
now
ripe
for
decision
and
threatens
basic
first
amendment
rights,
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
holding
the
statute
constitution
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
finally
settled
in
the
florida
courts
and
florida
election
scheduled
within
a
few
months
and
this
statute
would
seriously
inhibit
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
in
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
would
deter
the
exercise
of
those
rights.
and
i
think
under
the
principles
laid
down
in
mills
versus
alabama,
this
case
is
ripe
for
decision.
to
sanction
the
florida
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
except
that
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
from
point
of
view
of
inhibiting
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
in
florida
would
still
stand,
even
if
the
non-constitutional
issues
should
provide
success
for
the
miami
herald
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
the
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
the
florida
supreme
court
has
held
the
statute
constitutional
and
of
course
the
herald
would,
in
the
absence
of
the
reversal
by
this
court,
would
have
to
abide
by
the
constitutional
ruling
of
the
highest
court
in
its
state.
it
would
therefore
vitally
affect
not
only
the
herald’s
rights,
but
many
other
newspapers
rights
in
florida
who
would
be
guided
by
that
decision
in
the
exercise
of
their
editorial
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
print
the
replies
of
political
candidates.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
mills
versus
alabama,
it’s
not
necessary
that
the
non-constitutional
issues
remaining
in
the
case,
all
be
resolved
when
the
decision
of
the
state
court
inhibits
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
and
to
sanction
the
florida
statute,
this
court
would
have
to
make
a
fundamental
revision
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
correct,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
no,
it
was
not
a
first
amendment
case.
of
course,
again,
it
seems
really
an
exercise
in
futility
to
send
this
case
back
to
decide
the
non-constitutional
issues
and
then
have
it
wind
its
way
back
in
a
long
and
tortuous
process,
from
the
constitutional
issue,
which
obviously
in
the
light
of
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
will
have
to
be
decided.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
this
case
wouldn’t,
but
another
case
raising
the
same
issue
would
come
back
because
the
florida
supreme
court’s
decision
would
still
stand.
we
would
not
win
on
the
basis
of
non-constitutional
or
constitutional
rights
and
i
think
that
that
issue
will
inhibit
the
exercise
of
those
rights
in
florida
until
it
is
settled.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
yes,
i
think
we

compelling
a
newspaper
to
print
is
the
same
as
telling
it
what
not
to
print.
it
is
censorship
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment.
there
is
a
national
policy
that
has
been
expressed
in
the
first
amendment,
that
newspapers
should
not
be
deterred
in
printing
what
they
choose
particularly
about
political
candidates.
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
the
cbs
case,
the
first
amendment
protects
newspapers
from
the
intrusive
editorial
form
of
government.
if
there
is
any
area
where
the
role
of
the
press
under
the
first
amendment
must
remain
unfettered,
it
is
criticism
of
political
candidates
of
the
very
kind
expressed
in
this
case.
one
of
the
chief
roles
of
the
press
is
vigorous
criticism
of
candidates
and
the
public
officials.
newspapers
historically
in
this
country
have
been
in
the
business
of
grinding
access
and
particularly
political
ones.
editorial
discretion
and
judgment
must
mean
freedom
to
choose
what
to
print
and
what
not
to
print.
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
pointed
out
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
case,
editors
are
editing
is
what
editors
are
for
and
editing
is
selection
and
choice
of
material.
the
only
restrains
on
the
autonomy
of
the
press,
which
this
court
sanctioned
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
case
in
its
non-business
aspect,s
are
the
restraints
imposed
by
its
readers
and
by
its
journalistic
integrity.
the
attempts
at
regulation
of
fairness
or
balance
of
newspapers
strikes
at
the
very
core
of
the
first
amendment.
as
professor
barren
concedes
in
his
writings,
it
would
lead
to
the
press
being
treated
as
a
public
utility
and
licensing
of
the
press
would
be
the
result.
there
would
be
a
return
to
the
conditions,
which
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
first
amendment
to
begin
with.
freedom
of
the
press,
not
fairness
is
what
the
first
amendment
is
concerned
with.
fairness
has
been
left
to
the
editors.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
the
cbs
case,
fairness
is
too
fragile
a
commodity
to
be
left
to
the
government
to
decide.
although
the
florida
statute
is
vague
and
ambiguous,
it
is
certainly
broad
in
scope.
it
may
be
invoked
by
any
candidate,
who
has
filed
for
local,
state
or
federal
law
office.
in
fact,
it
may
be
invoked
by
an
incumbent
public
official,
as
soon
as
he
qualifies
for
reelection
and
becomes
a
candidate.
it
applies
to
any
criticism
of
the
candidate
published
in
the
newspaper.
it
is
not
limited
to
editorial
criticism.
it
applies
at
the
very
least,
to
news
articles,
to
syndicated
columns,
to
cartoons.
in
fact
the
statute
could
be
triggered
by
a
news
article
in
which
one
candidate
assails
another.
a
reply
is
demanded
and
the
other
candidate
demands
a
counter
reply
and
the
entire
round-robin
ad
infinitum
could
be
setup
in
the
newspaper.
one
article
which
criticized
several
candidates
would
trigger
as
many
replies,
as
there
were
candidates
criticized.
each
under
the
statute
would
be
entitled
to
his
separate
reply.
it
would
apply
to
newspapers
whether
or
not
they
were
published
in
florida.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
under
the
florida
statute,
each
of
the
candidates
would
have
an
answer.
a
new
york
times
story
for
example,
on
florida
politics,
would
trigger
the
statute
and
the
new
york
times
under
penalty
of
criminal
sanctions
would
be
required
to
accept
replies
of
florida
candidates.
and
again,
i
emphasize
that
this
statute
applies
without
regard
to
the
true
or
the
falsity
or
the
fairness
of
the
original
article,
regardless
of
whether
there
was
any
malice
involved.
in
fact
this
statute
stands
the
libel
standards
of
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
on
its
head.
newspapers
which
publish
something
which
is
true
may
be
required
to
publish
a
totally
false
reply.
as
i
said,
statute
carries
criminal
penalties.
the
editor
can
be
put
in
jail
for
up
to
a
year
and
fined
a
thousand
dollars
in
addition
to
the
civil
remedies,
which
have
been
implied
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
now
the
appellee
seeks
to
justify
this
sweeping
incursion
on
the
first
amendment
on
the
ground
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
fair
elections
and
that
this
justifies
abridgment.
we
submit
that
such
an
argument
ignores
this
court’s
holding
in
mills
versus
alabama,
which
interestingly
is
not
cited
in
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
or
in
the
appellee’s
briefs.
in
the
mills
case,
it
was
argued
in
defense
of
that
alabama
statute
that
purity
of
elections,
justified
this
ever
so
slight,
abridgment
of
the
first
amendment
made
by
the
statute,
not
to
publish
any
critical
of
a
candidate
on
election
day.
nevertheless
the
court
struck
that
statute
down
on
the
ground
that
the
state's
interest
in
fair
elections
could
not
justify
an
abridgment
of
the
first
amendment.
secondly,
we
are
told
by
appellee
that
the
statute
is
justified
by
the
economic
concentration
of
the
media.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
justify
appellee’s
argument
that
the
media
is
now
one
vast
monolith.
the
facts
are,
that
there
is
much
more
diversity
in
the
media
and
in
the
number
of
media,
than
at
the
time
the
first
amendment
was
adopted.
but
again,
the
court
has
found
in
the
associated
press
case
that
even
antitrust
violations
do
not
justify
infringement
of
the
first
amendment.
of
course,
the
press
has
power.
it’s
obvious
that
the
press
has
to
have
power
to
assure
its
editorial
independence
and
to
assure
that
it
can
fulfill
its
role
under
the
first
amendment.
interestingly
enough,
the
argument
made
in
this
case
for
this
statute
and
the
benefits
it
theoretically
would
provide,
the
statute
would
have
exactly
the
opposite
effect.
newspapers,
particularly
small
ones,
with
space
limitations
would
be
deterred
in
publishing
political
criticism
for
fear
of
triggering
the
statute.
publications
for
example
with
the
distinct
editorial
viewpoints
would
have
the
greatest
dilemma
of
all.
will
the
12
black
newspapers,
serving
the
black
community
in
florida
have
to
give
equal
time
to
george
wallace
to
reply
as
a
candidate,
despite
the
views
of
the
particular
editor
of
that
newspaper
in
the
community
which
it
serves?
there
are
many
other
examples
but
we
submit
that
an
examination
of
this
statute
on
its
face
dictates
that
the
opinion
of
the
florida
supreme
court
must
be
reversed.
i
should
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
p.
s.
paul
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
briefly,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
two
misstatements
by
professor
barron
in
reference
to
the
statute.
he
refers
to
the
statute
as
applying
only
to
criticism
published
in
a
newspaper
published
in
the
same
community
where
the
candidate
is.
there
is
no
such
limitation
in
the
statute.
as
i
said
it
would
apply
to
the
new
york
times
if
it
happens
to
publish
something
about
a
particular
florida
election
and
the
candidates
involved.
and
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
the
criminal
penalty
can
be
detached
from
the
statute.
the
florida
supreme
court
has
let
the
criminal
penalty
standing,
but
there
is
no
way
that
any
candidate
can
get
a
reply
under
this
statute
by
any
other
way
than
the
criminal
penalty
because
the
florida
supreme
court
has
knocked
out
the
mandatory
injunction
penalty,
on
the
old
common
law
theory
that
equity
will
enjoin
a
crime,
a
rule
which
is
followed
in
florida.
so
without
the
criminal
penalty
this
would
not
provoke
any
reply.
mr.
barron
keeps
talking
about
mr.
tornillo
being
censored
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
any
such
assertion
that
mr.
tornillo
did
not
get
his
message
across.
mr.
barron
describes
mr.
tornillo
as
a
public
figure
and
as
a
controversial
man.
we
would
have
to
be
very
naive
to
think
that
mr.
tornillo
was
relying
entirely
on
a
paragraph
statement
in
the
miami
herald
in
order
to
get
his
message
across
in
his
campaign.
there
is
nothing
that
shows
that
he
was
muzzled,
but
i
think
de
novo
it
comes
down
to
the
concluding
remarks
that
professor
barron
made
when
he
says
that
this
case
poses
compete
--
competing
first
amendment
interest
in
conflict.
there
are
no
competing
first
amendment
interests
in
conflict
here.
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
to
use
the
press.
there
is
no
right
of
a
citizen
to
be
interviewed
by
the
press.
there
is
no
right
to
have
a
letter
that
a
citizen
may
write
to
the
press
to
have
that
letter
printed.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
it
out
yesterday
in
the
prison
cases,
the
editor
might
just
as
well
throw
that
letter
in
the
waste
basket
if
he
determines
that
he
does
not
desire
to
print
it.
a
judicial
inquiry
into
the
editorial
discretion
and
the
editorial
function
is
not
permissible
under
the
first
amendment.
compulsion
is
the
same
as
censorship
and
there
is
no
difference
between
saying
that
you
shall
publish
and
you
shall
not
publish
under
the
first
amendment.
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
it
out,
our
founding
fathers
in
writing
the
first
amendment
opted
for
a
free
press,
not
a
fair
press.
they
decided
fairness
was
too
fragile
an
issue
for
them
to
deal
with.
it
is
the
only
first
amendment
we
have
as
pointed
it
out
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
case
and
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
court
to
rewrite
that
amendment.
the
issue
is
really
who
decides
what
gets
in
to
the
newspaper?
the
government,
the
florida
legislature
or
the
editor
of
the
free
newspaper.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
the
florida
legislature
to
regulate
the
fairness
of
political
criticism
without
violating
the
first
amendment.
i
understand
that
professor
barron
says
this
is
a
noble
concept,
but
motherhood
is,
as
one
editor
pointed
out,
also
a
noble
condition.
but
motherhood
under
compulsion
is
the
product
of
rape
and
it
begets
illegitimacy
and
to
force
an
editor
to
print
in
his
editorial
judgment
what
he
does
not
desire
and
his
conscience
does
not
wish
to
print
or
he
may
think
is
not
true
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
