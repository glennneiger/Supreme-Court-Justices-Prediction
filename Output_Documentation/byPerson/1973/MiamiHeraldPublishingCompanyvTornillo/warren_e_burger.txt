--
chief

before
the
north
dakota
case,
do
you
think
you
might
have
some
serious
troubles
on
jurisdiction
here?
chief

warren
e.
burger
you
think
--
you
rest
on
that
very
firmly,
i
notice
in
your
reply
brief?
chief

warren
e.

very
well.
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
mr.
tornillo
in
the
course
of
his
campaign
had
announced
after
this
editorial
attack
that
on
the
next
friday
night
he
was
going
to
take
care
of
the
miami
herald
and
had
announcements
throughout
the
week
and
advertising
to
build
up
an
audience
on
that
conflict
and
that
on
wednesday
the
miami
herald
said
they
wanted
equal
time
and
would
like
to
have
one
of
their
editors
or
someone
present
to
answer.
do
you
think
mr.
tornillo
would
have
to
yield
half
of
the
time
on
the
platform
in
the
hall
he
had
rented
for
that
occasion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statute
does
not
apply
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
one
step
further
on
my
question
i
had
only
a
preliminary.
suppose
florida
had
a
statute
that
required
a
candidate
for
office
who
attacked
a
newspaper
to
give
equal
time
in
the
place
and
setting
in
which
he
made
the
attack
on
the
newspaper,
would
you
then
have
an
approximate
parallel
to
this
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
come
down
to
the
question
of
whether
a
state
statute
can
impose,
goes
back
to
your
[voice
overlap]
or
it
can
impose
a
duty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
they
ever
decided
that
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
daniel
paul?
chief

you

the
case
is
submitted.
