mr.
jerome
a.
barron
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
jerome
barron
and
i
am
counsel
for
appellee
pat
tornillo.
first
thing,
i
think
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
answer
a
question
and
that
question
is,
who
is
pat
tornillo
as
i
read
the
host
to
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case
on
the
other
side.
i
had
to
scratch
my
head
sometimes
to
remember
who
tornillo
was
because
as
i
read
the
briefs
he
sounds
like
he
was
some
high
official
in
the
government.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
tornillo.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
mr.
justice
rehnquist
tornillo.
pat
tornillo
is
the
executive
director
of
the
classroom
teachers'
association
of
dade
county,
florida
and
he
is
a
very
controversial
fellow
and
he
intends
to
remain
being
a
very
controversial
fellow.
mr.
tornillo
led
the
school
teachers
of
florida
in
a
strike
which
angered
the
governor
of
florida.
he
--
and
it
also
angered
the
miami
herald
as
we
are
reminded
in
these
editorials
in
the
appendix
in
this
case.
that
is
everybody’s
right
to
be
angered
and
to
say
what
they
please
under
our
constitution.
what
mr.
tornillo
wanted,
however,
when
he
read
this
editorial
was
to
fulfill
his
role
as
to
use
the
phrase
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
this
court’s
very
own
phrase
he
wanted
to
serve
a
role
as
a
citizen
critic
of
government.
mr.
tornillo
had
an
advantage
over
other
people
who
had
have
media
problems.
first
of
all,
he
lived
in
a
state
which
has
and
has
had
a
right
of
reply
statute
since
1913.
secondly,
he
had
the
advantage
of
this
court’s
plurality
opinion
in
rosenbloom
against
metromedia.
and
in
that
case
and
if
there
is
any
quotation
that
is
important
in
this
case,
in
any
particular
portion
of
the
opinion
that’s
in
rosenbloom
that
is
important,
it
is
the
passage
and
it’s
very
short
but
i
like
to
bring
at
the
court’s
attention.
in
403
u.s.
29
at
page
47,
mr.
justice
brennan
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
chief
justice
burger
said
this.
“if
the
states
fear
that
private
citizens
will
not
be
able
to
respond
adequately
to
publicity
involving
them,
the
solution
lies
in
the
direction
of
insuring
their
ability
to
respond
rather
than
in
stifling
public
discussion
of
matters
of
public
concern.”
to
me
the
paradox
of
this
case
is
that
we
have
mountains
of
print
in
this
case
about
censorship
and
the
only
person
who
had
been
sensitive
in
this
proceeding
is
pat
tornillo.
the
question
before
the
court,
the
question
presented
by
the
statute
is
if
a
candidate
during
the
course
of
an
election
is
editorially
attacked
by
a
daily
newspaper
in
his
community,
may
a
state
statute
afford
him
a
reply
of
similar
amount
of
space?
that
is
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that’s
right,
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
other
words,
the
position
of
course
is
that
generally
there
are
no
access
rights
to
the
media,
that
is
the
law.
you
are
quite
right
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
the
point
is
that
if
one
becomes
a
candidate
and
one
is
attacked
then
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
but
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
the
media
still
have
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
not
quite
mr.
justice
marshall
because
the
media
will
still
have
the
upper
hand
because
if
they
have
attacked
him
prior
to
the
time
he
became
a
candidate
and
then
he
becomes
a
candidate,
they
still
will
be
able
to
deny
him
a
forum
under
the
statute
as
long
as
they
don’t
editorial
attack
--
as
long
as
they
do
not
editorially
attack
him.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
and
is
attacked.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
yes
he
could
be,
i
understand
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
yes,
but
my
point
is
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
i
don’t
believe
that
the
statute
goes
quite
that
far
mr.
justice
marshall.
as
i
read
the
statute,
the
attack
would
have
to
come
after
he
is
become
a
candidate.
well,
if
that’s
what
you’re
saying,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
he
is
insulated
from
not
being
able
to
respond.
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
there
has
been
considerable
discussion
in
the
argument
of
the
appellant
about
the
criminal
features
of
the
statute.
in
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
this
case
no
criminal
sanctions
were
ever
asked
for.
moreover,
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
when
the
same
parties
and
amici
who
are
here
made
the
same
argument
about
the
criminality
of
the
statute
104.38,
the
florida
supreme
court
on
page
39
in
this
petition
for
rehearing
said
that
no
criminal
penalty
is
sought
in
the
case
sub
judice,
they
emphasize
that.
they
said
that
very
clearly
on
page
39
and
therefore
the
validity
vel
non
of
the
criminal
penalty
is
not
here
involved.
now
obviously
the
court
only
wanted
to
pass
upon
the
case
before
them,
but
they
certainly
prepared
the
way
for
the
future
in
case
there
was
a
criminal
proceeding
because
they
said
on
the
very
next
page,
page
40
of
the
appendix,
anticipating
a
criminal
penalty,
they
said
the
statute
is
so
constructed
that
the
criminal
penalty
can
be
easily
severed
and
deleted
and
still
leave
a
complete
legislative
expression
establishing
a
civil
right
to
damages.
that
language
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
second
paragraph
on
page
39.
i
believe
these
two
pages
of
the
court
decision
below
are
very
fundamental
to
an
understanding
of
this
case.
and
if
you
look
at
paragraph
2
on
page
39
what
they
talk
about
is
the
fact
that
what
was
sought
by
tornillo
was
the
publication
of
a
reply.
that
is
all
that
is
before
this
court
is
a
civil
proceeding
to
enforce
a
reply.
we
quite
understand
the
reason
and
the
drive
to
have
this
conceded
as
a
criminal
penalty
in
hopes
in
validating,
but
that
is
simply
is
not
this
procedure.
that
is
not
this
proceeding
at
all.
this
statue
can
be
justified
on
two
very
familiar
propositions
of
constitutional
law.
the
first
is
that
some
regulation,
some
regulation
of
the
press
is
permissible
so
long
as
it
serves
an
overriding
police
power
purpose.
along
with
our
brief
on
the
merits
to
this
court
we
submitted
an
appendix,
our
own
appendix
of
a
146
pages
reciting
various
kinds
of
state
statutes
which
restrict
the
press.
the
primary
motivation
in
preparing
that
appendix
which
has
--
collects
statutes
about
our
restricting
electioneering
at
the
post,
and
reporting
boycotts
in
newspapers,
and
reporting
the
names
of
rape
victims
in
newspapers
and
so
on.
the
point
of
that
was
not
to
glory
in
regulation
at
all.
it
was
because
we
thought
the
statute
that
we
are
defending
is
so
much
superior.
why
did
we
think
it
was
so
much
superior
because
unlike
the
legislation
that
i
am
talking
about,
this
statute
does
not
detract
from
expression
one
iota.
what
it
does
is
it
adds
to
the
realm
of
discretion,
so
that
the
statute
has
the
unique
feature
of
both
responding
to
a
police
power
purpose
and
free
and
fair
and
honest
election
and
implementing
one
of
the
grand
ideas.
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
when
this
court
said
that
it
considered
that
famous
case
against
a
profound
commitment,
national
commitment
to
debate
vigorous
free
and
wide
open.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
mr.
justice
rehnquist
let
me
answer
your
question
this
way.
in
the
rich
case
law
that
has
developed
since
this
court’s
decision
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
in
1964
for
example
you
take
the
case
as
the
go
from
new
york
times
against
sullivan
to
rosenbloom
against
metromedia
in
1971.
i
think
you
see
the
breakdown
of
an
implied
premise
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan.
the
case
talks
and
i
just
said,
i
just
gave
the
word,
the
case
talks
about
the
word
debate
and
i
think
the
assumption
of
this
court
was
that
if
the
media
are
free
as
perhaps
they
should
be
from
the
specter
of
heavy
damage
suits
that
can
put
them
out
of
business,
that
then
we
would
have
vigorous
criticism
of
governmental
institutions
and
of
public
issues
that
was
finally
held
in
result
by
this
court
in
rosenbloom.
however,
by
the
time
the
new
york
times
against
sullivan
fact
situation
was
extended,
first
from
elected
public
officials
to
non-elected
public
official
to
public
figures
and
finally
in
rosenbloom
just
to
anyone
involved
in
a
public
issue.
what
happened
was
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
plurality
opinion
in
rosenbloom,
the
situation
arose
or
the
conclusion
developed
that
it
may
not
be
true
that
debate
will
come
merely
by
removing
newspapers
from
libel
--
from
heavy
libel
suits
for
damages.
that
is
why
in
the
plurality
opinion,
it
was
suggested
that
damages
revisited
was
the
answer,
but
rather
that
the
answer
might
be
to
allow
some
kind
of
reply.
florida
with
prophetic
judgment
has
precisely
the
statute
geared
to
fulfill
that
purpose,
to
let
new
york
times
against
sullivan
live,
but
yet
to
have
debate.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
he
would
not
mr.
chief
justice
because
florida
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
the
statute
does
not
apply
him
and
may
i
just
speak
a
little
further
to
your
point
because
i
think
it’s
again
a
fundamental
point
in
this
case.
this
case
has
occasion
of
apparently
good
deal
of
interest,
yet,
again
as
i
had
to
struggle
as
i
read
through
the
briefs
of
the
amici
until
and
so
on
to
remember
who
mr.
tornillo
was,
i
also
had
a
struggle
to
remember
what
this
case
was
about.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
establishment
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
case
law
of
a
right
of
reply
with
all
the
problems
of
establishing
parameters
that,
that
would
involve.
this
case
raises
a
much
more
narrow
and
a
much
more
conventional
constitutional
question
and
that
question
is
if
a
state
by
statute
fulfilling
a
police
power
purpose,
a
purpose
to
go
as
directly
to
implement
in
the
electoral
code.
if
a
state
passes
such
a
statute
which
also
happens
to
respond
to
the
interest
of
public
debate
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
is
such
a
statute
constitutional
and
it
seems
to
me
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
a
much
more
limited
and
a
much
more
familiar
task
for
constitutional
adjudication.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
no,
mr.
chief
justice
i
do
not
believe
you
would
for
this
reason.
from
marsh
against
alabama
to
many
first
amendment
cases
ever
since,
one
of
the
insistent
themes
of
this
court
has
been
are
there
alternative
avenues
of
communication?
i
am
not
frankly
worried
about
the
access
problems
of
the
miami
herald
for
the
circulation
of
350,000,
the
dominant
paper
in
the
state
of
florida
with
82%
of
the
circulation
in
dade
county.
the
other
newspaper,
the
miami
news
has
only
about
80,000
in
circulation,
so
that
under
this
court’s
own
principles
in
terms
of
alternative
means,
in
terms
of
restriction
on
free
expression
it
seems
to
me
that
the
constitutional
case
for
this
statute
would
be
much
greater
than
the
statute
governing
that
situation.
it
is
not
our
position
here.
it
is
not
our
position
here
that
we
wish
the
newspapers
of
this
country
to
say
anything
in
their
editorials
that
they
do
not
wish
to
say.
let
them
say
what
they
please.
what
we
have
is
a
situation
that
perhaps
none
of
us
wanted.
i
do
not
see
any
conspiracy
of
the
press
not
to
the
contrary.
we
live
here
in
the
20th
century
when
economics
and
technology
have
given
us
a
world
perhaps
we
did
not
want.
and
what
we
want
--
what
our
task
is
to
try
to
make
an
adjustment
so
that
freedom
of
speech
and
process
we
understand
it
and
as
we
believe
in
it
can
endure
it,
that
is
our
problem.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
get
guidance
from
this
case
in
terms
of
what
the
first
amendment
was
all
about
and
how
this
statute
responds
to
that.
mr.
justice
brandeis'
great
and
eloquent
concurring
opinion
in
whitney
against
california
and
what
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
there
was
in
a
couple
of
famous
pages
he
said
that,
“liberty
could
be
a
means
as
well
as
an
end”
and
that
is
why
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
appellant
and
all
of
the
sincere
people
i
do
not
doubt
on
the
other
side.
i
do
not
believe
that
it's
completely
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
say
that
if
someone
is
attacked
to
the
point
of
destruction
he
cannot
reply.
i
do
not
believe
the
first
amendment
means
that.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that
is
true,
your
honor
and
it
is
a
situation
i
regret
but
it
is
a
fact.
but
we
make
progress
in
life
incrementally
and
i
believe
that
the
sustaining
of
the
statute
would
be
progress
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment.
now
i
would
like
just
to
say
a
couple
of
other
things
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
brandeis’
opinion
in
whitney
against
california
because
i
really
think
it
is
terribly
dispositive
and
helpful
to
this
proceeding.
mr.
justice
brandeis
asked
two
questions
and
after
all
this
is
a
person
who
himself
studied
the
press,
mr.
justice
brandeis,
the
most
famous
of
all
law
review
articles
is
his
article
on
the
right
of
privacy
in
4
harvard
law
review.
and
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
two
things
as
to
why
we
have
first
amendment
protection.
first
of
all
he
said
we
have
first
amendment
protection
because
public
discussion
is
a
political
duty.
what
did
he
mean
by
public
discussion
is
a
political
duty?
he
meant
that
public
discussion
is
a
political
duty
in
the
sense
of
what
we
talk
about
today
in
our
contemporary
language
as
the
public’s
right
to
know.
then
he
said
something
else
which
i
think
is
equally
responsive
and
significant
in
trying
to
ascertain
the
validity
of
this
legislation.
mr.
justice
brandies
said,
“opportunity
to
air
supposed
grievances
is
the
path
of
safety.
opportunity
to
air
supposed
grievances
is
the
path
of
safety.
”what
did
he
mean
by
that?
i
believe
what
he
meant
by
that
is
that
if
we
are
going
to
have
things
like
freedom
of
speech
and
press,
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
free
society,
then
people
have
to
have
a
sense
of
justice
about
existing
institutions.
he
believed
that
if
they
could
reach
an
audience
that
if
they
could
--
that
if
we
could
have
what
this
court
has
always
talked
about,
debate
then
our
institutions,
our
free
institution
would
be
secure.
it
seems
to
me
that
104.38,
the
florida
right
of
reply
statute
though
permits
the
airing
of
supposed
grievances,
and
notice
how
artfully
mr.
justice
brandeis
wrote.
he
didn’t
say
there
were
legitimate
grievances.
he
said
supposed
grievances.
i
find
it
shocking
that
the
people
on
the
other
side
should
say
well
they
can
publish
a
false
reply.
this
court
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
it
has
given
the
media
that
opportunity
to
write
false
replies
in
the
sense,
a
false
editorials
rather,
in
the
sense
that
we
are
not
interested
whether
ultimately
whether
in
the
eye
of
eternity
something
is
true
or
false.
unless
we
can
show
calculatedly
that
it
is
false
first
--
from
our
first
amendment
point
of
view,
we
are
not
interested
because
we
know
that
we
are
going
to
have
hurly
burly
of
free
debate
we
cannot
stop
and
pause
to
verify
each
statement
but
by
the
same
law
and
doctrine
that
gives
that
latitude
to
the
miami
herald,
should
not
tornillo.
if
a
state
statute
has
given
it
to
him,
shall
he
not
have
also
the
same
remedy,
the
same
right?
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
hope
that
is
not
so.
i
hope
that
we
can
work
out
of
an
accommodation
between
the
two.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
not
necessary
to
change
any
of
our
ideas
about
what
should
be
in
the
content
of
editorials.
on
the
other
hand,
in
terms
of
the
realities
that
i
averted
to
before
i
think
it
is
possible
for
us
to
have
both.
i
think
it
is
possible
if
we
go
with
a
statute
that
is
careful
enough
and
the
situation
that
cries
out
for
some
redress
injustice,
this
one
does,
it
seems
to
me
we
can
have
both.
now,
it
maybe
that
we
could
have
situations
where
the
two
would
be
incompatible.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
such
a
case.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
one
another
argument
that
has
been
made
here,
and
that
is
the
so-called
chilling
effect
argument.
i
am
a
teacher
of
constitutional
law.
i
am
supposed
to
know
what
chilling
effect
means
whether
i
do
or
not,
but
in
any
case
chilling
effect
comes
from
the
dombrowski
against
pfister.
what
was
dombrowski
against
pfister
all
about?
the
dombrowski
against
pfister
was
a
case
with
civil
rights
workers
who
wanted
to
engage
in
protection
that
was
unquest
--
an
activity
and
expression
that
was
unquestionably
protected.
and
they
were
faced
with
a
situation
where
law
enforcement
people
said,
in
effect,
we
will
prosecute
you,
we
don’t
care
whether
we
win
or
not.
we
will
prosecute
you,
we
will
fix
your
first
amendment
right,
so
that
the
specter
of
a
prison
was
put
aside
or
was
a
threat
to
the
implantation
of
free
expression.
is
that
this
case?
this,
the
florida
court
it
seems
to
me,
has
done
all
but
any
state
court
can
do
in
a
case
that
did
not
involve
or
request
for
from
criminal
sanctions
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
criminal
prosecution.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
that
the
chilling
effect
that
was
talked
about
in
dombrowski
is
a
world
away
from
the
cry
we
have
heard
in
this
case
which
is
that
if
we
must
give
our
proponent
of
forum
we
would
rather
say
nothing.
to
call
that
chilling
effect,
i
think
we
have
to
ask
a
question.
who
then
is
putting
the
chilling
effect
on
the
expression
of
constitutional
right?
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
would
be
true
absence
the
statute.
if
it
seems
that
if
we
had
a
request
that
mr.
justice
marshall
was
suggesting
by
a
private
citizen,
absent
of
statute
then,
and
i
think
this
is
what
your
question
was
addressed
to,
then
we
would
have
a
state
action
problem.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
but
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
since
this
court
has
held
time
without
number
that
the
first
amendment
is
not
absolute,
that
a
state
statute
that
imposes
some
duties
on
the
miami
herald
changes
that
situation.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
this
statute
is
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
and
our
position
is
a
twofold
line
and
it
is
a
very
simple
position.
first,
that
it
is
justified
by
an
overriding
police
power
purpose
and
conventional
of
first
amendment
and
police
power
ideas.
and
secondly,
and
this
is
what
we
believe
is
the
unique
feature
of
the
case
that
since
it
adds
to
expression
rather
than
detracts
from
expression
that
what
it
does
really
is
instead
of
offending
the
first
amendment
it
implemented
it
at
least
under
the
statute
and
with
these
facts.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
mr.
justice
marshall
i
believe
there
is
a
great
difference.
to
respond
directly
to
your
question,
if
the
state
shall
say
you
shall
not
publish,
then
i
think
we
are
by
anyone's
reckoning
by
anyone’s
view
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
historic
area
of
censorship.
whereas
if
you
say
that
a
state
--
if
a
state
says
you
shall
publish
a
reply
then
you
are
not
telling
this
--
the
newspaper
may
not
say
something
or
even
that
it
must
take
a
position
that
it
dislikes.
the
only
censorship
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that’s
right
because
they
can
tell
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that
is
correct
but
what
i
mean
by
that
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
i
am
sorry.
what
i
mean
by
that
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
institutionally
they
are
still
free.
if
this
statute
is
sustained
every
paper
in
florida
will
still
be
free
editorially
to
attack
anyone
they
wish.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that
is
correct
if
the
statute
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
it
is
seems
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
governmental
control
of
a
degree
that
is
any
where
like
many
of
the
statute
that
restrict
the
press
that
we
called
to
your
attention.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
well,
you
take
if
a
statute
says
that
a
newspaper
cannot
mention
the
name
of
a
rape
victim
in
the
paper
that
of
course
is
something
they
cannot
say.
now
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
this
court
has
a
case
before
it,
now
is
cox
against
cohn
broadcasting
which
raise
that
very
question
and
there
again
you
have
just
as
in
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall
you
have
really
competing
constitutional
claims
because
you
see
the
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
i
would
have
great
doubt
about
the
constitutionality.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
no
because
the
–
no,
mr.
justice
marshall
i
don’t
believe
it
would
because
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
because
we
are
not
sure
that
we
have
responsiveness.
the
whole
idea
of
the
right
of
reply
goes
to
responsiveness.
if
we
have
attack
and
reply
then
it
seems
me
we
are
in
a
debate.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
and
so
i
think
that
differs,
sir
from
the
hypothetical
that
you
suggest.
but
may
i
in
the
just
remaining
time
that
i
have
and
adverting
to
the
fact
of
the
cox
against
cohn
broadcasting
is
before
this
court,
it
seems
to
me,
it
seems
that
what
we
have
there
of
course
is
a
right
of
privacy
problem
against
of
the
free
press
problem.
the
fascinating
thing
about
this
case
of
course
is
that
we
have
competing
first
amendment
interest
in
conflict.
unless
you
take
the
view
that
the
only
people
who
are
protected
by
freedom
of
the
press
are
those
who
work
in
the
media
and
on
stock
in
it.
unless
you
take
that
view
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
it
is
not
a
naive
view
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
an
inadequate
view
and
for
this
reason
i
think
in
view
of
the
inability
to
respond
is
this
court
talked
about
in
rosenbloom
if
that
it
is
a
danger
really
to
free
expression.
if
we
exhaust
the
free
expression
rights
of
the
american
people
with
the
property
rights
of
those
who
own
communication
facilities.
this
is
not
to
say
those
who
own
and
work
in
such
facilities
do
not
have
first
amendment
rights,
of
course
they
do.
the
question
is,
can
we
afford
some
modicum
to
some
slight
legislative
aid
to
make
the
debate
we
have
all
been
talking
about
a
reality.
and
it
is
my
position
that
the
sustaining
of
the
statute
would
lead
precisely
to
that.
now,
if
the
argument
is
that
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
one
could
be
presented
with
statutes
which
would
raise
great
problems
then
the
answer
to
that
is
this
court
has
said
again
time
without
number
is
that
it
is
a
process
of
constitution.
it
is
part
of
the
task
and
the
obligation
of
constitutional
adjudication
to
draw
lines
and
to
save
the
beyond
this
point,
we
will
not
go.
but
we
have
not
reach
that
point
we
have
far
from
reached
it
in
this
case.
your
honor,
i
think
i
have
said
all
that
i
wish
to
say.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
jerome
barron
and
i
am
counsel
for
appellee
pat
tornillo.
first
thing,
i
think
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
answer
a
question
and
that
question
is,
who
is
pat
tornillo
as
i
read
the
host
to
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case
on
the
other
side.
i
had
to
scratch
my
head
sometimes
to
remember
who
tornillo
was
because
as
i
read
the
briefs
he
sounds
like
he
was
some
high
official
in
the
government.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
tornillo.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
mr.
justice
rehnquist
tornillo.
pat
tornillo
is
the
executive
director
of
the
classroom
teachers'
association
of
dade
county,
florida
and
he
is
a
very
controversial
fellow
and
he
intends
to
remain
being
a
very
controversial
fellow.
mr.
tornillo
led
the
school
teachers
of
florida
in
a
strike
which
angered
the
governor
of
florida.
he
--
and
it
also
angered
the
miami
herald
as
we
are
reminded
in
these
editorials
in
the
appendix
in
this
case.
that
is
everybody’s
right
to
be
angered
and
to
say
what
they
please
under
our
constitution.
what
mr.
tornillo
wanted,
however,
when
he
read
this
editorial
was
to
fulfill
his
role
as
to
use
the
phrase
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
this
court’s
very
own
phrase
he
wanted
to
serve
a
role
as
a
citizen
critic
of
government.
mr.
tornillo
had
an
advantage
over
other
people
who
had
have
media
problems.
first
of
all,
he
lived
in
a
state
which
has
and
has
had
a
right
of
reply
statute
since
1913.
secondly,
he
had
the
advantage
of
this
court’s
plurality
opinion
in
rosenbloom
against
metromedia.
and
in
that
case
and
if
there
is
any
quotation
that
is
important
in
this
case,
in
any
particular
portion
of
the
opinion
that’s
in
rosenbloom
that
is
important,
it
is
the
passage
and
it’s
very
short
but
i
like
to
bring
at
the
court’s
attention.
in
403
u.s.
29
at
page
47,
mr.
justice
brennan
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
chief
justice
burger
said
this.
“if
the
states
fear
that
private
citizens
will
not
be
able
to
respond
adequately
to
publicity
involving
them,
the
solution
lies
in
the
direction
of
insuring
their
ability
to
respond
rather
than
in
stifling
public
discussion
of
matters
of
public
concern.”
to
me
the
paradox
of
this
case
is
that
we
have
mountains
of
print
in
this
case
about
censorship
and
the
only
person
who
had
been
sensitive
in
this
proceeding
is
pat
tornillo.
the
question
before
the
court,
the
question
presented
by
the
statute
is
if
a
candidate
during
the
course
of
an
election
is
editorially
attacked
by
a
daily
newspaper
in
his
community,
may
a
state
statute
afford
him
a
reply
of
similar
amount
of
space?
that
is
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that’s
right,
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
other
words,
the
position
of
course
is
that
generally
there
are
no
access
rights
to
the
media,
that
is
the
law.
you
are
quite
right
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
the
point
is
that
if
one
becomes
a
candidate
and
one
is
attacked
then
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
but
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
the
media
still
have
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
not
quite
mr.
justice
marshall
because
the
media
will
still
have
the
upper
hand
because
if
they
have
attacked
him
prior
to
the
time
he
became
a
candidate
and
then
he
becomes
a
candidate,
they
still
will
be
able
to
deny
him
a
forum
under
the
statute
as
long
as
they
don’t
editorial
attack
--
as
long
as
they
do
not
editorially
attack
him.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
and
is
attacked.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
yes
he
could
be,
i
understand
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
yes,
but
my
point
is
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
i
don’t
believe
that
the
statute
goes
quite
that
far
mr.
justice
marshall.
as
i
read
the
statute,
the
attack
would
have
to
come
after
he
is
become
a
candidate.
well,
if
that’s
what
you’re
saying,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
he
is
insulated
from
not
being
able
to
respond.
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
there
has
been
considerable
discussion
in
the
argument
of
the
appellant
about
the
criminal
features
of
the
statute.
in
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
this
case
no
criminal
sanctions
were
ever
asked
for.
moreover,
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
when
the
same
parties
and
amici
who
are
here
made
the
same
argument
about
the
criminality
of
the
statute
104.38,
the
florida
supreme
court
on
page
39
in
this
petition
for
rehearing
said
that
no
criminal
penalty
is
sought
in
the
case
sub
judice,
they
emphasize
that.
they
said
that
very
clearly
on
page
39
and
therefore
the
validity
vel
non
of
the
criminal
penalty
is
not
here
involved.
now
obviously
the
court
only
wanted
to
pass
upon
the
case
before
them,
but
they
certainly
prepared
the
way
for
the
future
in
case
there
was
a
criminal
proceeding
because
they
said
on
the
very
next
page,
page
40
of
the
appendix,
anticipating
a
criminal
penalty,
they
said
the
statute
is
so
constructed
that
the
criminal
penalty
can
be
easily
severed
and
deleted
and
still
leave
a
complete
legislative
expression
establishing
a
civil
right
to
damages.
that
language
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
second
paragraph
on
page
39.
i
believe
these
two
pages
of
the
court
decision
below
are
very
fundamental
to
an
understanding
of
this
case.
and
if
you
look
at
paragraph
2
on
page
39
what
they
talk
about
is
the
fact
that
what
was
sought
by
tornillo
was
the
publication
of
a
reply.
that
is
all
that
is
before
this
court
is
a
civil
proceeding
to
enforce
a
reply.
we
quite
understand
the
reason
and
the
drive
to
have
this
conceded
as
a
criminal
penalty
in
hopes
in
validating,
but
that
is
simply
is
not
this
procedure.
that
is
not
this
proceeding
at
all.
this
statue
can
be
justified
on
two
very
familiar
propositions
of
constitutional
law.
the
first
is
that
some
regulation,
some
regulation
of
the
press
is
permissible
so
long
as
it
serves
an
overriding
police
power
purpose.
along
with
our
brief
on
the
merits
to
this
court
we
submitted
an
appendix,
our
own
appendix
of
a
146
pages
reciting
various
kinds
of
state
statutes
which
restrict
the
press.
the
primary
motivation
in
preparing
that
appendix
which
has
--
collects
statutes
about
our
restricting
electioneering
at
the
post,
and
reporting
boycotts
in
newspapers,
and
reporting
the
names
of
rape
victims
in
newspapers
and
so
on.
the
point
of
that
was
not
to
glory
in
regulation
at
all.
it
was
because
we
thought
the
statute
that
we
are
defending
is
so
much
superior.
why
did
we
think
it
was
so
much
superior
because
unlike
the
legislation
that
i
am
talking
about,
this
statute
does
not
detract
from
expression
one
iota.
what
it
does
is
it
adds
to
the
realm
of
discretion,
so
that
the
statute
has
the
unique
feature
of
both
responding
to
a
police
power
purpose
and
free
and
fair
and
honest
election
and
implementing
one
of
the
grand
ideas.
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
when
this
court
said
that
it
considered
that
famous
case
against
a
profound
commitment,
national
commitment
to
debate
vigorous
free
and
wide
open.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
mr.
justice
rehnquist
let
me
answer
your
question
this
way.
in
the
rich
case
law
that
has
developed
since
this
court’s
decision
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
in
1964
for
example
you
take
the
case
as
the
go
from
new
york
times
against
sullivan
to
rosenbloom
against
metromedia
in
1971.
i
think
you
see
the
breakdown
of
an
implied
premise
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan.
the
case
talks
and
i
just
said,
i
just
gave
the
word,
the
case
talks
about
the
word
debate
and
i
think
the
assumption
of
this
court
was
that
if
the
media
are
free
as
perhaps
they
should
be
from
the
specter
of
heavy
damage
suits
that
can
put
them
out
of
business,
that
then
we
would
have
vigorous
criticism
of
governmental
institutions
and
of
public
issues
that
was
finally
held
in
result
by
this
court
in
rosenbloom.
however,
by
the
time
the
new
york
times
against
sullivan
fact
situation
was
extended,
first
from
elected
public
officials
to
non-elected
public
official
to
public
figures
and
finally
in
rosenbloom
just
to
anyone
involved
in
a
public
issue.
what
happened
was
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
plurality
opinion
in
rosenbloom,
the
situation
arose
or
the
conclusion
developed
that
it
may
not
be
true
that
debate
will
come
merely
by
removing
newspapers
from
libel
--
from
heavy
libel
suits
for
damages.
that
is
why
in
the
plurality
opinion,
it
was
suggested
that
damages
revisited
was
the
answer,
but
rather
that
the
answer
might
be
to
allow
some
kind
of
reply.
florida
with
prophetic
judgment
has
precisely
the
statute
geared
to
fulfill
that
purpose,
to
let
new
york
times
against
sullivan
live,
but
yet
to
have
debate.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
he
would
not
mr.
chief
justice
because
florida
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
the
statute
does
not
apply
him
and
may
i
just
speak
a
little
further
to
your
point
because
i
think
it’s
again
a
fundamental
point
in
this
case.
this
case
has
occasion
of
apparently
good
deal
of
interest,
yet,
again
as
i
had
to
struggle
as
i
read
through
the
briefs
of
the
amici
until
and
so
on
to
remember
who
mr.
tornillo
was,
i
also
had
a
struggle
to
remember
what
this
case
was
about.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
establishment
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
case
law
of
a
right
of
reply
with
all
the
problems
of
establishing
parameters
that,
that
would
involve.
this
case
raises
a
much
more
narrow
and
a
much
more
conventional
constitutional
question
and
that
question
is
if
a
state
by
statute
fulfilling
a
police
power
purpose,
a
purpose
to
go
as
directly
to
implement
in
the
electoral
code.
if
a
state
passes
such
a
statute
which
also
happens
to
respond
to
the
interest
of
public
debate
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
is
such
a
statute
constitutional
and
it
seems
to
me
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
a
much
more
limited
and
a
much
more
familiar
task
for
constitutional
adjudication.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
no,
mr.
chief
justice
i
do
not
believe
you
would
for
this
reason.
from
marsh
against
alabama
to
many
first
amendment
cases
ever
since,
one
of
the
insistent
themes
of
this
court
has
been
are
there
alternative
avenues
of
communication?
i
am
not
frankly
worried
about
the
access
problems
of
the
miami
herald
for
the
circulation
of
350,000,
the
dominant
paper
in
the
state
of
florida
with
82%
of
the
circulation
in
dade
county.
the
other
newspaper,
the
miami
news
has
only
about
80,000
in
circulation,
so
that
under
this
court’s
own
principles
in
terms
of
alternative
means,
in
terms
of
restriction
on
free
expression
it
seems
to
me
that
the
constitutional
case
for
this
statute
would
be
much
greater
than
the
statute
governing
that
situation.
it
is
not
our
position
here.
it
is
not
our
position
here
that
we
wish
the
newspapers
of
this
country
to
say
anything
in
their
editorials
that
they
do
not
wish
to
say.
let
them
say
what
they
please.
what
we
have
is
a
situation
that
perhaps
none
of
us
wanted.
i
do
not
see
any
conspiracy
of
the
press
not
to
the
contrary.
we
live
here
in
the
20th
century
when
economics
and
technology
have
given
us
a
world
perhaps
we
did
not
want.
and
what
we
want
--
what
our
task
is
to
try
to
make
an
adjustment
so
that
freedom
of
speech
and
process
we
understand
it
and
as
we
believe
in
it
can
endure
it,
that
is
our
problem.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
get
guidance
from
this
case
in
terms
of
what
the
first
amendment
was
all
about
and
how
this
statute
responds
to
that.
mr.
justice
brandeis'
great
and
eloquent
concurring
opinion
in
whitney
against
california
and
what
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
there
was
in
a
couple
of
famous
pages
he
said
that,
“liberty
could
be
a
means
as
well
as
an
end”
and
that
is
why
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
appellant
and
all
of
the
sincere
people
i
do
not
doubt
on
the
other
side.
i
do
not
believe
that
it's
completely
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
say
that
if
someone
is
attacked
to
the
point
of
destruction
he
cannot
reply.
i
do
not
believe
the
first
amendment
means
that.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that
is
true,
your
honor
and
it
is
a
situation
i
regret
but
it
is
a
fact.
but
we
make
progress
in
life
incrementally
and
i
believe
that
the
sustaining
of
the
statute
would
be
progress
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment.
now
i
would
like
just
to
say
a
couple
of
other
things
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
brandeis’
opinion
in
whitney
against
california
because
i
really
think
it
is
terribly
dispositive
and
helpful
to
this
proceeding.
mr.
justice
brandeis
asked
two
questions
and
after
all
this
is
a
person
who
himself
studied
the
press,
mr.
justice
brandeis,
the
most
famous
of
all
law
review
articles
is
his
article
on
the
right
of
privacy
in
4
harvard
law
review.
and
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
two
things
as
to
why
we
have
first
amendment
protection.
first
of
all
he
said
we
have
first
amendment
protection
because
public
discussion
is
a
political
duty.
what
did
he
mean
by
public
discussion
is
a
political
duty?
he
meant
that
public
discussion
is
a
political
duty
in
the
sense
of
what
we
talk
about
today
in
our
contemporary
language
as
the
public’s
right
to
know.
then
he
said
something
else
which
i
think
is
equally
responsive
and
significant
in
trying
to
ascertain
the
validity
of
this
legislation.
mr.
justice
brandies
said,
“opportunity
to
air
supposed
grievances
is
the
path
of
safety.
opportunity
to
air
supposed
grievances
is
the
path
of
safety.
”what
did
he
mean
by
that?
i
believe
what
he
meant
by
that
is
that
if
we
are
going
to
have
things
like
freedom
of
speech
and
press,
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
free
society,
then
people
have
to
have
a
sense
of
justice
about
existing
institutions.
he
believed
that
if
they
could
reach
an
audience
that
if
they
could
--
that
if
we
could
have
what
this
court
has
always
talked
about,
debate
then
our
institutions,
our
free
institution
would
be
secure.
it
seems
to
me
that
104.38,
the
florida
right
of
reply
statute
though
permits
the
airing
of
supposed
grievances,
and
notice
how
artfully
mr.
justice
brandeis
wrote.
he
didn’t
say
there
were
legitimate
grievances.
he
said
supposed
grievances.
i
find
it
shocking
that
the
people
on
the
other
side
should
say
well
they
can
publish
a
false
reply.
this
court
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
it
has
given
the
media
that
opportunity
to
write
false
replies
in
the
sense,
a
false
editorials
rather,
in
the
sense
that
we
are
not
interested
whether
ultimately
whether
in
the
eye
of
eternity
something
is
true
or
false.
unless
we
can
show
calculatedly
that
it
is
false
first
--
from
our
first
amendment
point
of
view,
we
are
not
interested
because
we
know
that
we
are
going
to
have
hurly
burly
of
free
debate
we
cannot
stop
and
pause
to
verify
each
statement
but
by
the
same
law
and
doctrine
that
gives
that
latitude
to
the
miami
herald,
should
not
tornillo.
if
a
state
statute
has
given
it
to
him,
shall
he
not
have
also
the
same
remedy,
the
same
right?
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
hope
that
is
not
so.
i
hope
that
we
can
work
out
of
an
accommodation
between
the
two.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
not
necessary
to
change
any
of
our
ideas
about
what
should
be
in
the
content
of
editorials.
on
the
other
hand,
in
terms
of
the
realities
that
i
averted
to
before
i
think
it
is
possible
for
us
to
have
both.
i
think
it
is
possible
if
we
go
with
a
statute
that
is
careful
enough
and
the
situation
that
cries
out
for
some
redress
injustice,
this
one
does,
it
seems
to
me
we
can
have
both.
now,
it
maybe
that
we
could
have
situations
where
the
two
would
be
incompatible.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
such
a
case.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
one
another
argument
that
has
been
made
here,
and
that
is
the
so-called
chilling
effect
argument.
i
am
a
teacher
of
constitutional
law.
i
am
supposed
to
know
what
chilling
effect
means
whether
i
do
or
not,
but
in
any
case
chilling
effect
comes
from
the
dombrowski
against
pfister.
what
was
dombrowski
against
pfister
all
about?
the
dombrowski
against
pfister
was
a
case
with
civil
rights
workers
who
wanted
to
engage
in
protection
that
was
unquest
--
an
activity
and
expression
that
was
unquestionably
protected.
and
they
were
faced
with
a
situation
where
law
enforcement
people
said,
in
effect,
we
will
prosecute
you,
we
don’t
care
whether
we
win
or
not.
we
will
prosecute
you,
we
will
fix
your
first
amendment
right,
so
that
the
specter
of
a
prison
was
put
aside
or
was
a
threat
to
the
implantation
of
free
expression.
is
that
this
case?
this,
the
florida
court
it
seems
to
me,
has
done
all
but
any
state
court
can
do
in
a
case
that
did
not
involve
or
request
for
from
criminal
sanctions
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
criminal
prosecution.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
that
the
chilling
effect
that
was
talked
about
in
dombrowski
is
a
world
away
from
the
cry
we
have
heard
in
this
case
which
is
that
if
we
must
give
our
proponent
of
forum
we
would
rather
say
nothing.
to
call
that
chilling
effect,
i
think
we
have
to
ask
a
question.
who
then
is
putting
the
chilling
effect
on
the
expression
of
constitutional
right?
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
would
be
true
absence
the
statute.
if
it
seems
that
if
we
had
a
request
that
mr.
justice
marshall
was
suggesting
by
a
private
citizen,
absent
of
statute
then,
and
i
think
this
is
what
your
question
was
addressed
to,
then
we
would
have
a
state
action
problem.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
but
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
since
this
court
has
held
time
without
number
that
the
first
amendment
is
not
absolute,
that
a
state
statute
that
imposes
some
duties
on
the
miami
herald
changes
that
situation.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
this
statute
is
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
and
our
position
is
a
twofold
line
and
it
is
a
very
simple
position.
first,
that
it
is
justified
by
an
overriding
police
power
purpose
and
conventional
of
first
amendment
and
police
power
ideas.
and
secondly,
and
this
is
what
we
believe
is
the
unique
feature
of
the
case
that
since
it
adds
to
expression
rather
than
detracts
from
expression
that
what
it
does
really
is
instead
of
offending
the
first
amendment
it
implemented
it
at
least
under
the
statute
and
with
these
facts.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
mr.
justice
marshall
i
believe
there
is
a
great
difference.
to
respond
directly
to
your
question,
if
the
state
shall
say
you
shall
not
publish,
then
i
think
we
are
by
anyone's
reckoning
by
anyone’s
view
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
historic
area
of
censorship.
whereas
if
you
say
that
a
state
--
if
a
state
says
you
shall
publish
a
reply
then
you
are
not
telling
this
--
the
newspaper
may
not
say
something
or
even
that
it
must
take
a
position
that
it
dislikes.
the
only
censorship
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that’s
right
because
they
can
tell
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that
is
correct
but
what
i
mean
by
that
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
i
am
sorry.
what
i
mean
by
that
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
institutionally
they
are
still
free.
if
this
statute
is
sustained
every
paper
in
florida
will
still
be
free
editorially
to
attack
anyone
they
wish.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
that
is
correct
if
the
statute
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
it
is
seems
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
governmental
control
of
a
degree
that
is
any
where
like
many
of
the
statute
that
restrict
the
press
that
we
called
to
your
attention.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
well,
you
take
if
a
statute
says
that
a
newspaper
cannot
mention
the
name
of
a
rape
victim
in
the
paper
that
of
course
is
something
they
cannot
say.
now
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
this
court
has
a
case
before
it,
now
is
cox
against
cohn
broadcasting
which
raise
that
very
question
and
there
again
you
have
just
as
in
this
case
mr.
justice
marshall
you
have
really
competing
constitutional
claims
because
you
see
the
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
i
would
have
great
doubt
about
the
constitutionality.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
no
because
the
–
no,
mr.
justice
marshall
i
don’t
believe
it
would
because
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
because
we
are
not
sure
that
we
have
responsiveness.
the
whole
idea
of
the
right
of
reply
goes
to
responsiveness.
if
we
have
attack
and
reply
then
it
seems
me
we
are
in
a
debate.
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
and
so
i
think
that
differs,
sir
from
the
hypothetical
that
you
suggest.
but
may
i
in
the
just
remaining
time
that
i
have
and
adverting
to
the
fact
of
the
cox
against
cohn
broadcasting
is
before
this
court,
it
seems
to
me,
it
seems
that
what
we
have
there
of
course
is
a
right
of
privacy
problem
against
of
the
free
press
problem.
the
fascinating
thing
about
this
case
of
course
is
that
we
have
competing
first
amendment
interest
in
conflict.
unless
you
take
the
view
that
the
only
people
who
are
protected
by
freedom
of
the
press
are
those
who
work
in
the
media
and
on
stock
in
it.
unless
you
take
that
view
--
mr.
jerome
a.
barron
it
is
not
a
naive
view
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
an
inadequate
view
and
for
this
reason
i
think
in
view
of
the
inability
to
respond
is
this
court
talked
about
in
rosenbloom
if
that
it
is
a
danger
really
to
free
expression.
if
we
exhaust
the
free
expression
rights
of
the
american
people
with
the
property
rights
of
those
who
own
communication
facilities.
this
is
not
to
say
those
who
own
and
work
in
such
facilities
do
not
have
first
amendment
rights,
of
course
they
do.
the
question
is,
can
we
afford
some
modicum
to
some
slight
legislative
aid
to
make
the
debate
we
have
all
been
talking
about
a
reality.
and
it
is
my
position
that
the
sustaining
of
the
statute
would
lead
precisely
to
that.
now,
if
the
argument
is
that
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
one
could
be
presented
with
statutes
which
would
raise
great
problems
then
the
answer
to
that
is
this
court
has
said
again
time
without
number
is
that
it
is
a
process
of
constitution.
it
is
part
of
the
task
and
the
obligation
of
constitutional
adjudication
to
draw
lines
and
to
save
the
beyond
this
point,
we
will
not
go.
but
we
have
not
reach
that
point
we
have
far
from
reached
it
in
this
case.
your
honor,
i
think
i
have
said
all
that
i
wish
to
say.
thank
you.
