the

if
nonetheless
when
we
will
have
to
decide
i
suppose,
do
you
read
the
florida
supreme
court’s
opinion
as
conferring
any
civil
right
upon
tornillo
when
the
case
goes
back
to
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county
and
his
right
to
civilly
proceed
against
your
client?
justice
william
h.

well
you
cite
in
your
brief
to
pages
16
and
17
of
the
appendix,
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion.
there
is
certainly
as
no
language
as
such
on
the
florida
supreme
court
that
says
he
can
recover
damages,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don’t
take
up
your
time
on
it.

justice
william

rehnquist
nothing
in
this
court
of
union
in
new
york
times
had
suggested
that
one
person
would
ever
like
to
comment,
there
is
somebody
else’s
printing
press
and
make
his
expression
that
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
of
course
the
only
entity
that
the
first
amendment
is
directed
against
is
the
government.
i
take
it
the
miami
herald
can
chill
anybody’s
rights
to
their
hearts
content,
they
are
not
violating
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
what
my
question
is
address
to,
but
what
you’re
saying
is
in
effect
that
the
real
chilling
here
comes
from
the
miami
herald?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
prevents
that
private
person
from
chilling
anybody’s
first
amendment
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
such
a
naive
view?
