what
would
happen
if
they
publish
editorial
against
all
of
the
candidates
in
one
political
party?
would
each
one
them
have
an
answer?
justice
thurgood

or
they
put
it
in
another
way,
a
person
who
cannot
reply
to
an
editorial
by
merely
becoming
candidate
automatically
gets
that
right?
justice
thurgood

so,
if
an
editorial
is
written
against
joe
dokes
(ph)
calling
him
anything
and
really
condemning
him
to
high
heaven
and
joe
dokes
says
well
i
know
how
to
fix
him,
i'll
become
a
candidate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
this
statute
--
justice

apply
to
him
even
if
a
man
does
that
deliberately,
this
statute
covers
him
[voice

justice
thurgood

joe
--
well
let
me
put
in
another
way.
if
he
is
an
ordinary
citizen
and
he
is
attacked,
he
can
get
no
redress
unless
he
becomes
a
candidate
--
justice
thurgood

but
if
he
becomes

well,
after
that
if
he
hadn't
become
a
candidate
he
could
still
be
attacked,
couldn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
to
insulate
him
from
attack
he
becomes
a
candidate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
statute
would
cover
him.
justice
thurgood

(inaudible)
justice
thurgood

but
you
can
just
attack
to
destruction
anybody
in
florida
except
a

justice
thurgood

what’s
the
difference
between
the
state
saying
you
shall
publish
“a”
and
the
state
say
you
shall
not
publish
“a”
in
the
first
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wait
a
minute.
you
said
you
are
not
making
them
take
the
position
they
dislike?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
miami
herald
liked
it
and
then
they
would
have
publish
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let’s
start
all
over
again.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
publish
what
they
don’t
want
to
publish?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
governmental
control?
justice
thurgood
marshall
none
like
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
of
course
the
state
says
that
every
newspaper
must
publish
any
material
that
can
be
classified
as
the
debate
by
any
politician
who
offers
it,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice

that
sure
would
build
up
the
debates
you’ve
been
talking
about?
justice

you
don’t
