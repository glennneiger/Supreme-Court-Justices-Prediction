thurgood
marshall
it

they’re
all
subject
to
be
thrown

do
you

justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
last
statement
is
not
in

that
he
was
a
disadvantage
as
anybody
else
in
the
service.
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you,
so
the
only
disruption
was
he
had
to
go
to
night
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
disruption
was
there,
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
because
of
his
disruption?
justice
thurgood

was
he
disrupted
other
than
the
