mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
conscientious
objectors
whose
religious
beliefs
prevent
them
from
serving
under
military
authority.
in
every
other
respect,
these
men
are
treated
precisely
like
every
other
registrant
drafted
under
the
selective
service
act.
they
are
drafted
in
accordance
with
the
normal
order
of
call.
they
are
drafted
no
matter
where
they
are
and
under
what
circumstances
their
civilian
life
places
them
except
as
to
the
normal
kind
of
exemptions
and
deferments.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
only
one,
but
the
statistics
are
not
kept.
the
fact
is
that
numerous
of
them
have
been
injured
and
your
question
is
quite
direct.
they
have
not
served
in
the
military
capacity
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
but
they
are
treated
in
every
other
respect.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
your
honor
the
--
it
goes
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
any
potential
for
hazardous
duty.
for
these
men,
there
is
just
as
much
potential
as
any
other
member
of
the
service.
these
men
can
be
deployed
at
the
will
of
the
president,
at
the
will
of
selective
service
that
the
president
and
the
selective
service
have
not
deployed
these
men
to
vietnam
on
the
whole
during
that
period,
really
only
reflects
in
my
mind
that
their
service
was
more
--
it
was
needed
more
that
they
were
doing
better
service
here.
there’s
no
inherent
limitation.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
they
couldn’t
be
deployed
to
combat
duty
but
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that’s
--
well,
that’s
true
your
honor,
but
there
are
i-a-o’s
in
the
service,
conscientious
objectors.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
they
may
not
be
sent
into
combat
[voice
overlap],
your
honor
i
haven’t
forgotten
it,
it
is
obviously
critical
to
this
case.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not,
but
as
the
senate
report
clearly
indicates
the
facts
that
these
men
are
under
discipline
doesn’t
at
all
disturb
their
ability
to
become
students.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
enhances
their
ability
to
become
students.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor,
they
are
subject
to
felony
--
federal
felony
criminal
prosecutions
for
their
violations.
they
are
not
subject
to
courts
martial
prosecution,
but
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
the
question
of
whether
any
of
these
differences
and
i
can
see
there
are
differences,
whether
any
of
these
difference
are
relevant
to
the
purpose
that
the
act
seeks
to
achieve.
this
act
has
stated
unlike
all
the
others,
i
think
ever
before
considered
by
this
court,
the
explicit
purposes
for
what
has
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
major
educational
programs
in
the
history
of
this
country.
the
explicit
purpose
that
congress
established
this
program
form
was
to
compensate
for
the
lost
time
that
a
man
entails
when
he
does
service
for
his
country.
the
fact
that
he
is
under
military
discipline,
the
fact
that
he
might
be
sent
into
combat
duty
does
not
raise
or
a
lower
or
in
anyway
affect
the
disruption
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
granted
these
benefits.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honors,
it
would
be
a
strange
or
maybe
even
a
cruel
irony
if
the
rigors
of
service
were
taken
into
account
when
and
by
this
court
in
assessing
this
legislation
when
congress
refused
to
even
parse
out
in
the
scale
of
benefits
more
benefits
for
those
men
who
actually
went
into
combat.
more
benefits
for
the
people
who
actually
face
death
on
the
front
lines.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
that
potential.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes
your
honor,
the
potential
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no.
your
honor,
there
are
two
questions
there
that
it
is
true
that
they
were
all
subject.
for
some,
the
potential
wasn’t
real
and
in
fact
it
never
materialized
and
congress
well
knew
that.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
it
is
absolutely
true
that
the
potential
is
there.
that
potential
vote
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
think
it’s
a
difference
to
be
reckon
with
your
honor
only
if
the
purpose
of
the
act
took
that
kind
of
difference
into
a
account
but
the
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor,
specifically
in
the
legislative
history
throughout
the
legislative
history
is
the
indication
that
these
benefits
are
not
a
bonus.
they
are
not
a
reward
for
hazardous
duty
or
the
risk
of
the
hazardous
duty.
this
is
given
to
men
for
the
normal
disruption
they
entail
based
on
their
time
and
service.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that’s
right.
he
went
to
school
part
time
at
night
over
a
period
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
unquestionably,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
thousands
have
and
many
of
those
thousands
have
gone
with
government,
have
been
financed
in
their
educational
pursuits
by
the
government
during
their
time
in
service.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor,
it’s
not
all
with
the
government’s
permission.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
that’s
right
but
the
man
stationed
at
a
boston
base
is
going
to
a
boston
college
at
night
has
the
same
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that
this
did
not
apply
to
anyone
in
the
active
military
service?
yes,
your
honor.
yes
the
national
health
service
specifically
included
and
those
men
received
benefits
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
about?
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
not
in
this
legislation.
not
in
this
legislative
history
but
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
he
is
a
veteran
of
alternative
service.
he
has
done
two
years
in
the
service
of
his
nation.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
in
those
terms.
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
he
has
a
release
from
his
service.
i
understand
what
you’re
saying.
he
is
not
a
veteran
of
military
service.
he
is
a
veteran
of
alternative
service.
the
legislative
history
does
not
speak
about
this
man
or
at
least
the
legislative
history
directed
towards
this
act,
but
the
prior
legislative
history
that
surrounds
these
kinds
of
benefits,
in
fact,
even
the
predecessors
to
this
act
does
speak
and
it
speaks
very
loudly.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
it
was
an
action
under
the
mandamus
statute
and
under
section
1331
general.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
am
not
--
that
has
not
been
settled
and
of
course
the
statute
says
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor
because
the
statute
says
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
it
doesn’t
say
mandamus.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
your
honor
i
think
if
the
constitution
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
if
there
is
affirmance
i
think
we
do
have
a
clear
right.
i
think
the
constitution
does
give
us
a
clear
right
to
these
benefits.
we
have
been
excluded
both
arbitrarily
and
i
believe
this
excluded
discriminatorily,
invidiously.
the
history
that
we
have
to
look
at
is
the
history
that
surrounds
the
veterans’
benefits
program
when
they
emerged
during
world
war
ii.
conscientious
objectors
who
did
alternative
service
were
specifically
excluded
by
congress
during
that
period
of
time.
the
question
came
before
congress;
it
wasn’t
as
if
congress
overlooked
the
problem.
congress
faced
it
a
several
important
times
and
yet
congress
refused
to
give
these
men
the
pittance
that
they
need
to
compensate
for
the
disabilities
that
they
suffered
just
as
much
as
anybody
in
the
military.
they
received
no
disability
benefits
for
physical
injuries.
they
received
no
dependency
allowances
and
in
world
war
ii,
they
weren’t
even
compensated
for
any
of
the
service
that
they
performed.
this
is
a
history
that
gives
birth
to
the
present
legislation
since
the
present
legislation
is
modeled
almost
directly
after
the
korean
war
g.i.
bill
and
after
the
world
war
ii
g.i.
bill.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that’s
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
are
no
guarantees
that
these
men
will
even
get
the
kind
of
workmen’s
compensation
that
might
cover
some
of
their
disabilities.
in
fact,
one
of
the
petitioners
in
the
hernandez
case
working
in
a
hospital
contracted
hepatitis
and
as
it
turns
out,
he
had
no
compensation
whatsoever
to
cover
that
disability.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
if
he
could
afford
it,
the
fact
is
your
honor,
these
men
are
paid
on
a
ratio
that
gives
them
the
standard
of
living
that
a
gi
has.
but
a
gi
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes
your
honor,
he
received
$80
a
month.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
mean
$80
a
week.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i’m
sorry.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
in
1970
or
1969
or
1970.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
it
was
always
outstanding.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes
your
honor,
it
did
apply.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
$80
a
week
to
cover
obviously
room
and
board
and
whatever,
and
food
to
the
extent
that
person
in
the
military
is
covered.
but
beyond
that
he
received
no
coverage.
in
fact,
as
i
say
in
world
war
ii,
these
men
did
that
service
and
they
received
no
compensation
whatsoever.
when
the
question
was
brought
before
congress
whether
the
money
they
earned
which
was
in
a
frozen
account
should
be
turned
over
to
their
dependents
who
in
many
cases
were
in
very
bad
scrapes
--
straits,
congress
refused
and
the
colloquy
that
we
reprinted
in
our
brief
indicates
that
congress
refused
because
it
was
afraid
of
public
reaction.
it
was
afraid
that
the
public
would
react
that
these
men
were
getting
away
with
something
when
they
definitely
were
not.
it
was
an
irrational
public
resentment
that
has
spurred
congress
on
to
the
deprivations
that
they
force
these
i-o
conscientious
objectors
to
bear.
your
honor,
these
men
are
subject
to
a
policy
of
disruption
of
their
lives
that
is
by
presidential
mandate
suppose
to
be
equal
to
the
disruption
generally
that
men
in
the
military
suffer.
the
government
has
indicated
that
this
policy
was
not
written
form
in
1966.
i
fail
to
see
the
relevance
of
that
--
the
relevance
of
that.
the
fact
is
that
that
policy
was
stated
throughout
by
the
selective
service
directors
since
the
inception
of
the
i-o
conscientious
objector
program.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
it
applies
to
this
man
in
the
sense
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
your
honor
this
is
a
class
action.
it
is
a
class
action
because
in
fact
they
are
men
that
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
his
life
was
disrupted
to
the
extent
that
he
was
forced
to
go
night
school
to
complete
one
year
of
college
on
his
own
on
whatever
money
he
could
scrape
together.
when
he
left
the
service,
he
did
not
have
enough
money
to
go
to
school.
he
had
to
work
a
whole
year
to
put
together
enough
money
to
undertake
his
first
year
of
law
school.
he
had
no
savings
when
he
left
the
service,
he
was
as
disadvantaged
as
any
member
of
the
military
in
that
respect.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
stated
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
i
can
see
that,
your
honor.
i
didn’t
say
that
way.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
the
only
your
honor,
that
was
a
substantial
disruption.
he
was
not
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
as
i
say,
when
he
left
the
service
he
had
no
money.
it
is
stated
in
the
complaint
in
and
in
affidavit
on
his
behalf.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
that
was
because
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
he
was
disrupted
because
he
received
an
$80
a
week
compensation
for
his
work
and
wasn’t
able
to
save
a
cent.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
believe
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
believe
he
was
in
school.
i’m
not
sure;
i’m
not
[voice
overlap]
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
don’t
know
what
he
was
doing
precisely
before
he
entered
the
service.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
as
we
state
in
the
complaint,
this
man
when
he
entered
law
school
faced
the
problem
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
continue
his
law
school
education
because
he
had
no
savings
that’s
why
he
brought
the
suit,
that’s
why
he
applied
for
a
veterans’
benefits.
he
had
no
money,
he
was
poor
and
he
was
left
poor
by
the
service
he
did.
now,
nobody
is
--
nobody
say
that
he
shouldn’t
have
done
his
service.
this
man
doesn’t
say
that.
all
he
is
saying
is,
that
when
a
man
who
does
military
service
is
left
in
that
condition
and
congress
gives
him
compensation
for
it,
this
man
deserves
the
same
compensation.
congress
hasn’t
said
that
this
man
is
disrupted
less
than
the
other.
i
will
give
him
less
compensation.
it
has
decided
that
he
should
receive
no
compensation
and
this
is
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
he
had
that
option
your
honor
and
of
course
our
claim
here
is
that
under
sherbert,
the
differential
that
the
government
has
established
places
a
burden
on
the
man
and
we
don’t
say
that
this
man
would’ve
bowed
under
to
that
burden,
but
places
a
burden
on
that
man
to
give
up
his
religious
scruples
and
serve
in
the
military
in
a
capacity
that
would
gain
him
benefits.
he
didn’t
do
that.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
would
say
your
honor
that
in
both
services
there
are
men
who
suffer
great
or
lesser
disruptions.
on
the
whole
i
would
say
that
the
men
in
alternative
service
suffer
the
same
general
scope
of
disruption
as
the
general
run
of
those
who
do
military
service
and
those
who
do
1-o
--
i-a-o
conscientious
objector
service
in
the
military.
the
fact
is
that
there
are
thousands
of
people
in
the
military
who
go
to
school
at
night
and
part-time.
draftees
who
go
to
school
at
night
and
during
the
part-time
period
that
they’re
not
in
service
or
they’re
not
serving
or
employed.
those
men
received
benefits
just
as
our
men
i
think
should
even
though
he
did
go
to
school
part-time.
this
act
doesn’t
parse
out
when
benefit
should
be
given.
it
is
given
during
war
time
and
peace
time.
it
doesn’t
relate
at
all
to
where
the
men
serves
or
under
what
conditions
he
serves.
all
it
requires
the
sole
criteria
for
receiving
these
benefits
is
180
days
service.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
absolutely,
your
honor
because
the
act
applies
retroactively.
it
took
up
three
to
four
million
people
who
serve
between
1955
and
1966
and
gave
them
benefits.
all
of
them
were
made
eligible
by
the
act
of
1966.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that
expired
on
the
very
day
that
the
retroactive
affect
attached.
in
other
words
there
has
always
been
a
gi
build
by
virtue
of
the
1966
act.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that
exactly
correct
your
honor,
but
it
is
a
fact
that
in
1966
the
act
applied
retroactively
to
everyone
who
served
between
1955
that
is
the
termination
date
of
the
korean
gi
bill
in
1966.
no
matter
where
they
served
or
under
what
conditions
and
it
--
the
scope
is
three
to
four
million
people
were
brought
under
the
coverage.
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
an
enormous
education
program
which
the
date
has
expended
over
$8.8
billion.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
it
is
not
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
it
is
declaration
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor
and
of
course
i
think
the
format
set
down
in
the
frontiero
case
where
the
court
affirms
that
in
a
situation
like
this
where
a
program
can
be
nullified
or
extended,
the
extension
will
be
granted
if
it
would
probably
--
if
it
was
likely
that
congress
would
want
to
maintain
the
program
even
with
this
additional
coverage
and
i
can’t
see
your
honor
how
congress
would
refuse
and
deny
millions
of
people
benefits
just
because
of
few
others
would
get
benefits.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that.
i
do
believe
that
based
on
the
legislative
history,
we
found
since
the
district
court
opinion.
i
will
say
we
did
not
present
it
to
the
district
court.
it
was
very
hard
to
come
by
but
from
the
material
we
have
been
able
to
gather,
i
do
believe
now
that
it
was
a
congressional
intention,
a
deliberate
intention
to
exclude
these
men.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that’s
true.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
on
the
fifth
amendment
that
it
violates
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
these
men
have
been
arbitrarily
excluded.
now,
i
will
say
your
honor
before
this
court,
we
reassert
our
position
under
sherbert
and
verner
and
under
the
heightened
scrutiny
need
demanded
by
the
equal
protection
guarantee.
we
are
entitled
to
that
scrutiny
and
we
are
entitled
to
a
constitutional
ruling
at
that
level.
in
other
words,
we
believe
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
a
ruling
that
without
a
compelling
state
interest,
without
any
compelling
interest
in
this
exclusion,
this
exclusion
both
denies
that
the
free
exercise
of
religion
under
the
first
amendment
and
denies
equal
protection
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
the
consequence
would
be
your
honor
that
the
clause
that
excludes
would
be
extended
to
cover
or
were
not
or
read
not
to
exclude
these
people
who
have
done
alternative
service
for
180
days.
your
honor,
i
do
want
to
assert
that
while
the
district
court
--
the
district
court’s
ruling
did
cover
the
first
amendment
claim
we
are
making
here
and
i
believe
we
are
properly
making
it
again,
the
government
has
not
responded
to
it.
we
assert
that
under
sherbert
and
verner
just
like
in
sherbert
and
verner
variable
government
benefits,
compensatory
benefits
are
being
denied
to
one
who
asserts
because
of
religious
belief,
a
view
that
here
she
cannot
undertake
some
conduct
which
brings
them
within
the
scope
of
eligibility.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
conditioning
of
veterans’
benefits
on
this
man’s
relinquishing
his
religious
beliefs.
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
excluding
these
men
as
harshly
as
congress
has
done,
i’d
like
to
hear
it
and
the
government
has
offered
none,
none
whatsoever
and
we
come
down
to
that
position.
is
the
government
able
to
supply
any
compelling
or
real
reason
why
these
men
are
excluded?
the
government
may
say
that
it’s
an
attempt
to
save
money.
your
honor,
i
submit
with
the
program
of
this
size
covering
these
many
people,
would
it
be
possible
that
congress
wanted
to
save
the
pittance
that
would
be
saved
if
a
few
thousand
were
excluded.
i
don’t
believe
that’s
true
and
in
addition,
i
also
don’t
believe
that
the
mere
objective
of
saving
money
is
a
compelling
interest.
on
the
whole
your
honor,
there
has
been
no
interest,
affirmative
interest
deserted
by
the
government
whatsoever.
the
only
interest
that
the
government
asserts
is
that
there
are
some
find
line
distinctions
in
many
cases
between
the
kind
of
service
one
man
does
and
the
kind
of
service
that
another
does.
those
distinctions
done
obtain
in
every
case
and
they
don’t
warrant
an
absolute
exclusion
from
these
valuable
benefits.
if
congress
wanted
to
draw
that
fine
line
it
has
the
language
to
do
it.
it
could
have
said,
we
want
to
give
benefits
to
those
who
have
done
military
service
they
faced
the
rigors
and
we
want
to
give
less
money
to
those
who
have
not
faced
those
rigors
of
military
service,
but
who
nonetheless
have
been
disrupted.
congress
could’ve
chosen
that
group
because
as
the
government
concedes
both
classes
of
people
have
suffered
educational
disruption.
congress
invoked
an
absolute
exclusion.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
was
positing
that
on
the
government’s
positions
that
there
was
a
difference.
if
there
was
such
a
difference
it
was
likely
congress
would’ve
reflected
it
in
its
legislation.
i
don’t
believe
there
is
a
difference.
i
am
positing
my
statement
on
a
government
assertion
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
nature
of
service.
what
we
have
here
an
absolute
exclusion,
one
that
reflects
no
differences
and
one
that
shuts
out
one
man
in
the
harshest
type
of
situation
and
it
shuts
him
out
from
needed
compensation
in
the
same
way
that
he
is
always
been
shut
out
from
all
the
other
kinds
of
needed
compensation
provided
to
veterans.
your
honors,
if
we
have
to
come
down
to
drawing
parallels,
i
submit
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
service
that
a
1-o
man
performs
and
the
service
that
i-a-o
man
performs,
that
is
the
conscientious
objective
in
the
military.
both
men
are
subjected
to
the
authority
of
the
government,
both
man
have
been
drafted.
both
are
likely
to
serve
in
areas
where
combat
is
on
going
although
both
are
prohibited
by
their
religious
beliefs
from
engaging
in
combat.
as
i
said,
the
i-o
conscientious
objector
maybe
deployed
at
any
time,
anywhere
by
the
president.
that
control
means
that
his
potential
in
any
given
situation
is
as
great
as
any
other
man
who
serves
in
this
government,
in
a
national
interest
and
in
the
national
defense.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
the
i-o
conscientious
objector?
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
in
some
cases,
your
honor.
in
some
cases
they
serve
in
camps
and
are
in
units
not
in
terms
of
military
units.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
the
appellee,
no.
now,
he
served
in
a
hospital.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
he
reported
first
to
the
director
of
the
hospital
i
imagine
and
then
to
the
state
director
of
selective
service
and
finally
to
the
president.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware.
i
am
not
aware
and
obviously
if
you
done
a
service
properly
there
are
probably
would
be
no
contact
unless
of
course,
unless
of
course
the
decision
was
made
on
the
part
of
the
president
that
these
men
were
needed
some
place
out
and
then
there
would
be
a
whole
rearranging
of
their
circumstances
and
they
would
be
shipped
off
to
whatever
assignment
the
president
deemed
necessary.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor.
the
fact
is
that
i-o
conscientious
objector
service
has
changed
latitudes
since
its
inception.
at
first,
these
men
served
in
the
camps,
in
federal
government
camps
and
now
they
are
not
serving
in
federal
government
camps
and
serving
in
mixed
responsibilities,
but
as
the
exigencies
of
any
crisis
period,
they
could
be
deployed
wherever
the
president
needs
them
the
most
and
the
only
assumption
i
think
the
court
can
reach
is
that
these
men
have
been
deployed
where
the
president
has
deemed
their
services
the
most
necessary
and
the
most
valuable.
i
want
to
reiterate
one
further
point.
this
act
states
purposes
that
are
explicit.
this
court
has
never
before,
i
believe,
had
the
opportunity
to
review
an
act
with
the
explicit
stated
purposes.
if
new
purposes
are
to
be
added,
new
substantive
purposes
are
to
be
added
i
believe
it
cannot
be
done
in
this
context.
congress
has
stated
its
purposes
and
by
virtue
of
that
statement,
i
believe
has
excluded
alternative
purposes.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor
as
i
understand
the
question
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
congress’
decisions
were
based
on
no
facts
whatsoever
and
purely
arbitrary,
then
i
believe
a
court
could
enter
that
area,
otherwise,
i
think
not.
that
the
court
is
bound
by
the
stated
purposes
and
those
purposes
are
binding
on
the
court
to
the
fullest
degree
as
they
are
here.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
there
is
no
question,
your
honor
and
i
concede
that,
but
none
of
those
cases
involved
legislation
that
stated
on
the
face
of
the
legislation,
they
are
for
direct
purposes
to
this
education
program
we
have
just
created
and
that’s
what
this
legislation
does.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
have
canvassed
many.
i
can’t
say
that
i
have
canvassed
them
all
and
from
what
i
can
tell
there
has
never
been
a
case
like
this.
i
see
that
my
time
is
almost
up,
are
there
any
further
questions
because
i
do
believe
that
at
this
point
i
would
just
simply
reiterate
that
we
do
assert
that
sherbert
versus
verner
governs
this
case
and
a
compelling
interest
is
required
and
none
has
been
offered
by
the
government
that
under
equal
protection
we
are
entitled
to
the
strict
scrutiny
review
because
in
this
case
first
amendment
protected
activity
that
is
religious
liberty
is
affected
by
the
regulations
that
we’re
challenging
and
in
an
addition,
i
submit
your
honors,
based
on
the
history
that
we
have
disclosed
in
our
brief
that
the
i-o
conscientious
objector
during
war
time
is
a
suspect
class
that
has
no
access
to
the
political
forums
that
is
at
the
mercy
of
public
resentment
as
the
history
discloses
and
there
has
been
ill-treated
consistently
throughout
their
history
and
deserves
the
protections
of
the
suspect
classification.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
conscientious
objectors
whose
religious
beliefs
prevent
them
from
serving
under
military
authority.
in
every
other
respect,
these
men
are
treated
precisely
like
every
other
registrant
drafted
under
the
selective
service
act.
they
are
drafted
in
accordance
with
the
normal
order
of
call.
they
are
drafted
no
matter
where
they
are
and
under
what
circumstances
their
civilian
life
places
them
except
as
to
the
normal
kind
of
exemptions
and
deferments.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
only
one,
but
the
statistics
are
not
kept.
the
fact
is
that
numerous
of
them
have
been
injured
and
your
question
is
quite
direct.
they
have
not
served
in
the
military
capacity
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
but
they
are
treated
in
every
other
respect.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
your
honor
the
--
it
goes
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
any
potential
for
hazardous
duty.
for
these
men,
there
is
just
as
much
potential
as
any
other
member
of
the
service.
these
men
can
be
deployed
at
the
will
of
the
president,
at
the
will
of
selective
service
that
the
president
and
the
selective
service
have
not
deployed
these
men
to
vietnam
on
the
whole
during
that
period,
really
only
reflects
in
my
mind
that
their
service
was
more
--
it
was
needed
more
that
they
were
doing
better
service
here.
there’s
no
inherent
limitation.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
they
couldn’t
be
deployed
to
combat
duty
but
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that’s
--
well,
that’s
true
your
honor,
but
there
are
i-a-o’s
in
the
service,
conscientious
objectors.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
they
may
not
be
sent
into
combat
[voice
overlap],
your
honor
i
haven’t
forgotten
it,
it
is
obviously
critical
to
this
case.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not,
but
as
the
senate
report
clearly
indicates
the
facts
that
these
men
are
under
discipline
doesn’t
at
all
disturb
their
ability
to
become
students.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
enhances
their
ability
to
become
students.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor,
they
are
subject
to
felony
--
federal
felony
criminal
prosecutions
for
their
violations.
they
are
not
subject
to
courts
martial
prosecution,
but
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
the
question
of
whether
any
of
these
differences
and
i
can
see
there
are
differences,
whether
any
of
these
difference
are
relevant
to
the
purpose
that
the
act
seeks
to
achieve.
this
act
has
stated
unlike
all
the
others,
i
think
ever
before
considered
by
this
court,
the
explicit
purposes
for
what
has
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
major
educational
programs
in
the
history
of
this
country.
the
explicit
purpose
that
congress
established
this
program
form
was
to
compensate
for
the
lost
time
that
a
man
entails
when
he
does
service
for
his
country.
the
fact
that
he
is
under
military
discipline,
the
fact
that
he
might
be
sent
into
combat
duty
does
not
raise
or
a
lower
or
in
anyway
affect
the
disruption
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
granted
these
benefits.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honors,
it
would
be
a
strange
or
maybe
even
a
cruel
irony
if
the
rigors
of
service
were
taken
into
account
when
and
by
this
court
in
assessing
this
legislation
when
congress
refused
to
even
parse
out
in
the
scale
of
benefits
more
benefits
for
those
men
who
actually
went
into
combat.
more
benefits
for
the
people
who
actually
face
death
on
the
front
lines.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
that
potential.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes
your
honor,
the
potential
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no.
your
honor,
there
are
two
questions
there
that
it
is
true
that
they
were
all
subject.
for
some,
the
potential
wasn’t
real
and
in
fact
it
never
materialized
and
congress
well
knew
that.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
it
is
absolutely
true
that
the
potential
is
there.
that
potential
vote
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
think
it’s
a
difference
to
be
reckon
with
your
honor
only
if
the
purpose
of
the
act
took
that
kind
of
difference
into
a
account
but
the
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor,
specifically
in
the
legislative
history
throughout
the
legislative
history
is
the
indication
that
these
benefits
are
not
a
bonus.
they
are
not
a
reward
for
hazardous
duty
or
the
risk
of
the
hazardous
duty.
this
is
given
to
men
for
the
normal
disruption
they
entail
based
on
their
time
and
service.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that’s
right.
he
went
to
school
part
time
at
night
over
a
period
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
unquestionably,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
thousands
have
and
many
of
those
thousands
have
gone
with
government,
have
been
financed
in
their
educational
pursuits
by
the
government
during
their
time
in
service.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor,
it’s
not
all
with
the
government’s
permission.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
that’s
right
but
the
man
stationed
at
a
boston
base
is
going
to
a
boston
college
at
night
has
the
same
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that
this
did
not
apply
to
anyone
in
the
active
military
service?
yes,
your
honor.
yes
the
national
health
service
specifically
included
and
those
men
received
benefits
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
about?
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
not
in
this
legislation.
not
in
this
legislative
history
but
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
he
is
a
veteran
of
alternative
service.
he
has
done
two
years
in
the
service
of
his
nation.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
in
those
terms.
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
he
has
a
release
from
his
service.
i
understand
what
you’re
saying.
he
is
not
a
veteran
of
military
service.
he
is
a
veteran
of
alternative
service.
the
legislative
history
does
not
speak
about
this
man
or
at
least
the
legislative
history
directed
towards
this
act,
but
the
prior
legislative
history
that
surrounds
these
kinds
of
benefits,
in
fact,
even
the
predecessors
to
this
act
does
speak
and
it
speaks
very
loudly.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
it
was
an
action
under
the
mandamus
statute
and
under
section
1331
general.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
am
not
--
that
has
not
been
settled
and
of
course
the
statute
says
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor
because
the
statute
says
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
it
doesn’t
say
mandamus.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
your
honor
i
think
if
the
constitution
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
if
there
is
affirmance
i
think
we
do
have
a
clear
right.
i
think
the
constitution
does
give
us
a
clear
right
to
these
benefits.
we
have
been
excluded
both
arbitrarily
and
i
believe
this
excluded
discriminatorily,
invidiously.
the
history
that
we
have
to
look
at
is
the
history
that
surrounds
the
veterans’
benefits
program
when
they
emerged
during
world
war
ii.
conscientious
objectors
who
did
alternative
service
were
specifically
excluded
by
congress
during
that
period
of
time.
the
question
came
before
congress;
it
wasn’t
as
if
congress
overlooked
the
problem.
congress
faced
it
a
several
important
times
and
yet
congress
refused
to
give
these
men
the
pittance
that
they
need
to
compensate
for
the
disabilities
that
they
suffered
just
as
much
as
anybody
in
the
military.
they
received
no
disability
benefits
for
physical
injuries.
they
received
no
dependency
allowances
and
in
world
war
ii,
they
weren’t
even
compensated
for
any
of
the
service
that
they
performed.
this
is
a
history
that
gives
birth
to
the
present
legislation
since
the
present
legislation
is
modeled
almost
directly
after
the
korean
war
g.i.
bill
and
after
the
world
war
ii
g.i.
bill.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that’s
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
are
no
guarantees
that
these
men
will
even
get
the
kind
of
workmen’s
compensation
that
might
cover
some
of
their
disabilities.
in
fact,
one
of
the
petitioners
in
the
hernandez
case
working
in
a
hospital
contracted
hepatitis
and
as
it
turns
out,
he
had
no
compensation
whatsoever
to
cover
that
disability.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
if
he
could
afford
it,
the
fact
is
your
honor,
these
men
are
paid
on
a
ratio
that
gives
them
the
standard
of
living
that
a
gi
has.
but
a
gi
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes
your
honor,
he
received
$80
a
month.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
mean
$80
a
week.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i’m
sorry.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
in
1970
or
1969
or
1970.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
it
was
always
outstanding.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes
your
honor,
it
did
apply.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
$80
a
week
to
cover
obviously
room
and
board
and
whatever,
and
food
to
the
extent
that
person
in
the
military
is
covered.
but
beyond
that
he
received
no
coverage.
in
fact,
as
i
say
in
world
war
ii,
these
men
did
that
service
and
they
received
no
compensation
whatsoever.
when
the
question
was
brought
before
congress
whether
the
money
they
earned
which
was
in
a
frozen
account
should
be
turned
over
to
their
dependents
who
in
many
cases
were
in
very
bad
scrapes
--
straits,
congress
refused
and
the
colloquy
that
we
reprinted
in
our
brief
indicates
that
congress
refused
because
it
was
afraid
of
public
reaction.
it
was
afraid
that
the
public
would
react
that
these
men
were
getting
away
with
something
when
they
definitely
were
not.
it
was
an
irrational
public
resentment
that
has
spurred
congress
on
to
the
deprivations
that
they
force
these
i-o
conscientious
objectors
to
bear.
your
honor,
these
men
are
subject
to
a
policy
of
disruption
of
their
lives
that
is
by
presidential
mandate
suppose
to
be
equal
to
the
disruption
generally
that
men
in
the
military
suffer.
the
government
has
indicated
that
this
policy
was
not
written
form
in
1966.
i
fail
to
see
the
relevance
of
that
--
the
relevance
of
that.
the
fact
is
that
that
policy
was
stated
throughout
by
the
selective
service
directors
since
the
inception
of
the
i-o
conscientious
objector
program.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
it
applies
to
this
man
in
the
sense
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
your
honor
this
is
a
class
action.
it
is
a
class
action
because
in
fact
they
are
men
that
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
his
life
was
disrupted
to
the
extent
that
he
was
forced
to
go
night
school
to
complete
one
year
of
college
on
his
own
on
whatever
money
he
could
scrape
together.
when
he
left
the
service,
he
did
not
have
enough
money
to
go
to
school.
he
had
to
work
a
whole
year
to
put
together
enough
money
to
undertake
his
first
year
of
law
school.
he
had
no
savings
when
he
left
the
service,
he
was
as
disadvantaged
as
any
member
of
the
military
in
that
respect.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
stated
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
well,
i
can
see
that,
your
honor.
i
didn’t
say
that
way.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
the
only
your
honor,
that
was
a
substantial
disruption.
he
was
not
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
as
i
say,
when
he
left
the
service
he
had
no
money.
it
is
stated
in
the
complaint
in
and
in
affidavit
on
his
behalf.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
that
was
because
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
he
was
disrupted
because
he
received
an
$80
a
week
compensation
for
his
work
and
wasn’t
able
to
save
a
cent.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
believe
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
believe
he
was
in
school.
i’m
not
sure;
i’m
not
[voice
overlap]
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
don’t
know
what
he
was
doing
precisely
before
he
entered
the
service.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
as
we
state
in
the
complaint,
this
man
when
he
entered
law
school
faced
the
problem
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
continue
his
law
school
education
because
he
had
no
savings
that’s
why
he
brought
the
suit,
that’s
why
he
applied
for
a
veterans’
benefits.
he
had
no
money,
he
was
poor
and
he
was
left
poor
by
the
service
he
did.
now,
nobody
is
--
nobody
say
that
he
shouldn’t
have
done
his
service.
this
man
doesn’t
say
that.
all
he
is
saying
is,
that
when
a
man
who
does
military
service
is
left
in
that
condition
and
congress
gives
him
compensation
for
it,
this
man
deserves
the
same
compensation.
congress
hasn’t
said
that
this
man
is
disrupted
less
than
the
other.
i
will
give
him
less
compensation.
it
has
decided
that
he
should
receive
no
compensation
and
this
is
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
he
had
that
option
your
honor
and
of
course
our
claim
here
is
that
under
sherbert,
the
differential
that
the
government
has
established
places
a
burden
on
the
man
and
we
don’t
say
that
this
man
would’ve
bowed
under
to
that
burden,
but
places
a
burden
on
that
man
to
give
up
his
religious
scruples
and
serve
in
the
military
in
a
capacity
that
would
gain
him
benefits.
he
didn’t
do
that.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
would
say
your
honor
that
in
both
services
there
are
men
who
suffer
great
or
lesser
disruptions.
on
the
whole
i
would
say
that
the
men
in
alternative
service
suffer
the
same
general
scope
of
disruption
as
the
general
run
of
those
who
do
military
service
and
those
who
do
1-o
--
i-a-o
conscientious
objector
service
in
the
military.
the
fact
is
that
there
are
thousands
of
people
in
the
military
who
go
to
school
at
night
and
part-time.
draftees
who
go
to
school
at
night
and
during
the
part-time
period
that
they’re
not
in
service
or
they’re
not
serving
or
employed.
those
men
received
benefits
just
as
our
men
i
think
should
even
though
he
did
go
to
school
part-time.
this
act
doesn’t
parse
out
when
benefit
should
be
given.
it
is
given
during
war
time
and
peace
time.
it
doesn’t
relate
at
all
to
where
the
men
serves
or
under
what
conditions
he
serves.
all
it
requires
the
sole
criteria
for
receiving
these
benefits
is
180
days
service.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
absolutely,
your
honor
because
the
act
applies
retroactively.
it
took
up
three
to
four
million
people
who
serve
between
1955
and
1966
and
gave
them
benefits.
all
of
them
were
made
eligible
by
the
act
of
1966.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that
expired
on
the
very
day
that
the
retroactive
affect
attached.
in
other
words
there
has
always
been
a
gi
build
by
virtue
of
the
1966
act.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
that
exactly
correct
your
honor,
but
it
is
a
fact
that
in
1966
the
act
applied
retroactively
to
everyone
who
served
between
1955
that
is
the
termination
date
of
the
korean
gi
bill
in
1966.
no
matter
where
they
served
or
under
what
conditions
and
it
--
the
scope
is
three
to
four
million
people
were
brought
under
the
coverage.
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
an
enormous
education
program
which
the
date
has
expended
over
$8.8
billion.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
it
is
not
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
it
is
declaration
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor
and
of
course
i
think
the
format
set
down
in
the
frontiero
case
where
the
court
affirms
that
in
a
situation
like
this
where
a
program
can
be
nullified
or
extended,
the
extension
will
be
granted
if
it
would
probably
--
if
it
was
likely
that
congress
would
want
to
maintain
the
program
even
with
this
additional
coverage
and
i
can’t
see
your
honor
how
congress
would
refuse
and
deny
millions
of
people
benefits
just
because
of
few
others
would
get
benefits.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that.
i
do
believe
that
based
on
the
legislative
history,
we
found
since
the
district
court
opinion.
i
will
say
we
did
not
present
it
to
the
district
court.
it
was
very
hard
to
come
by
but
from
the
material
we
have
been
able
to
gather,
i
do
believe
now
that
it
was
a
congressional
intention,
a
deliberate
intention
to
exclude
these
men.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that’s
true.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
i
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
on
the
fifth
amendment
that
it
violates
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
these
men
have
been
arbitrarily
excluded.
now,
i
will
say
your
honor
before
this
court,
we
reassert
our
position
under
sherbert
and
verner
and
under
the
heightened
scrutiny
need
demanded
by
the
equal
protection
guarantee.
we
are
entitled
to
that
scrutiny
and
we
are
entitled
to
a
constitutional
ruling
at
that
level.
in
other
words,
we
believe
--
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
a
ruling
that
without
a
compelling
state
interest,
without
any
compelling
interest
in
this
exclusion,
this
exclusion
both
denies
that
the
free
exercise
of
religion
under
the
first
amendment
and
denies
equal
protection
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
the
consequence
would
be
your
honor
that
the
clause
that
excludes
would
be
extended
to
cover
or
were
not
or
read
not
to
exclude
these
people
who
have
done
alternative
service
for
180
days.
your
honor,
i
do
want
to
assert
that
while
the
district
court
--
the
district
court’s
ruling
did
cover
the
first
amendment
claim
we
are
making
here
and
i
believe
we
are
properly
making
it
again,
the
government
has
not
responded
to
it.
we
assert
that
under
sherbert
and
verner
just
like
in
sherbert
and
verner
variable
government
benefits,
compensatory
benefits
are
being
denied
to
one
who
asserts
because
of
religious
belief,
a
view
that
here
she
cannot
undertake
some
conduct
which
brings
them
within
the
scope
of
eligibility.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
conditioning
of
veterans’
benefits
on
this
man’s
relinquishing
his
religious
beliefs.
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
excluding
these
men
as
harshly
as
congress
has
done,
i’d
like
to
hear
it
and
the
government
has
offered
none,
none
whatsoever
and
we
come
down
to
that
position.
is
the
government
able
to
supply
any
compelling
or
real
reason
why
these
men
are
excluded?
the
government
may
say
that
it’s
an
attempt
to
save
money.
your
honor,
i
submit
with
the
program
of
this
size
covering
these
many
people,
would
it
be
possible
that
congress
wanted
to
save
the
pittance
that
would
be
saved
if
a
few
thousand
were
excluded.
i
don’t
believe
that’s
true
and
in
addition,
i
also
don’t
believe
that
the
mere
objective
of
saving
money
is
a
compelling
interest.
on
the
whole
your
honor,
there
has
been
no
interest,
affirmative
interest
deserted
by
the
government
whatsoever.
the
only
interest
that
the
government
asserts
is
that
there
are
some
find
line
distinctions
in
many
cases
between
the
kind
of
service
one
man
does
and
the
kind
of
service
that
another
does.
those
distinctions
done
obtain
in
every
case
and
they
don’t
warrant
an
absolute
exclusion
from
these
valuable
benefits.
if
congress
wanted
to
draw
that
fine
line
it
has
the
language
to
do
it.
it
could
have
said,
we
want
to
give
benefits
to
those
who
have
done
military
service
they
faced
the
rigors
and
we
want
to
give
less
money
to
those
who
have
not
faced
those
rigors
of
military
service,
but
who
nonetheless
have
been
disrupted.
congress
could’ve
chosen
that
group
because
as
the
government
concedes
both
classes
of
people
have
suffered
educational
disruption.
congress
invoked
an
absolute
exclusion.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
was
positing
that
on
the
government’s
positions
that
there
was
a
difference.
if
there
was
such
a
difference
it
was
likely
congress
would’ve
reflected
it
in
its
legislation.
i
don’t
believe
there
is
a
difference.
i
am
positing
my
statement
on
a
government
assertion
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
nature
of
service.
what
we
have
here
an
absolute
exclusion,
one
that
reflects
no
differences
and
one
that
shuts
out
one
man
in
the
harshest
type
of
situation
and
it
shuts
him
out
from
needed
compensation
in
the
same
way
that
he
is
always
been
shut
out
from
all
the
other
kinds
of
needed
compensation
provided
to
veterans.
your
honors,
if
we
have
to
come
down
to
drawing
parallels,
i
submit
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
service
that
a
1-o
man
performs
and
the
service
that
i-a-o
man
performs,
that
is
the
conscientious
objective
in
the
military.
both
men
are
subjected
to
the
authority
of
the
government,
both
man
have
been
drafted.
both
are
likely
to
serve
in
areas
where
combat
is
on
going
although
both
are
prohibited
by
their
religious
beliefs
from
engaging
in
combat.
as
i
said,
the
i-o
conscientious
objector
maybe
deployed
at
any
time,
anywhere
by
the
president.
that
control
means
that
his
potential
in
any
given
situation
is
as
great
as
any
other
man
who
serves
in
this
government,
in
a
national
interest
and
in
the
national
defense.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
the
i-o
conscientious
objector?
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
in
some
cases,
your
honor.
in
some
cases
they
serve
in
camps
and
are
in
units
not
in
terms
of
military
units.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
the
appellee,
no.
now,
he
served
in
a
hospital.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
he
reported
first
to
the
director
of
the
hospital
i
imagine
and
then
to
the
state
director
of
selective
service
and
finally
to
the
president.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware.
i
am
not
aware
and
obviously
if
you
done
a
service
properly
there
are
probably
would
be
no
contact
unless
of
course,
unless
of
course
the
decision
was
made
on
the
part
of
the
president
that
these
men
were
needed
some
place
out
and
then
there
would
be
a
whole
rearranging
of
their
circumstances
and
they
would
be
shipped
off
to
whatever
assignment
the
president
deemed
necessary.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
no,
your
honor.
the
fact
is
that
i-o
conscientious
objector
service
has
changed
latitudes
since
its
inception.
at
first,
these
men
served
in
the
camps,
in
federal
government
camps
and
now
they
are
not
serving
in
federal
government
camps
and
serving
in
mixed
responsibilities,
but
as
the
exigencies
of
any
crisis
period,
they
could
be
deployed
wherever
the
president
needs
them
the
most
and
the
only
assumption
i
think
the
court
can
reach
is
that
these
men
have
been
deployed
where
the
president
has
deemed
their
services
the
most
necessary
and
the
most
valuable.
i
want
to
reiterate
one
further
point.
this
act
states
purposes
that
are
explicit.
this
court
has
never
before,
i
believe,
had
the
opportunity
to
review
an
act
with
the
explicit
stated
purposes.
if
new
purposes
are
to
be
added,
new
substantive
purposes
are
to
be
added
i
believe
it
cannot
be
done
in
this
context.
congress
has
stated
its
purposes
and
by
virtue
of
that
statement,
i
believe
has
excluded
alternative
purposes.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor
as
i
understand
the
question
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
congress’
decisions
were
based
on
no
facts
whatsoever
and
purely
arbitrary,
then
i
believe
a
court
could
enter
that
area,
otherwise,
i
think
not.
that
the
court
is
bound
by
the
stated
purposes
and
those
purposes
are
binding
on
the
court
to
the
fullest
degree
as
they
are
here.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
there
is
no
question,
your
honor
and
i
concede
that,
but
none
of
those
cases
involved
legislation
that
stated
on
the
face
of
the
legislation,
they
are
for
direct
purposes
to
this
education
program
we
have
just
created
and
that’s
what
this
legislation
does.
mr.
michael
david
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
have
canvassed
many.
i
can’t
say
that
i
have
canvassed
them
all
and
from
what
i
can
tell
there
has
never
been
a
case
like
this.
i
see
that
my
time
is
almost
up,
are
there
any
further
questions
because
i
do
believe
that
at
this
point
i
would
just
simply
reiterate
that
we
do
assert
that
sherbert
versus
verner
governs
this
case
and
a
compelling
interest
is
required
and
none
has
been
offered
by
the
government
that
under
equal
protection
we
are
entitled
to
the
strict
scrutiny
review
because
in
this
case
first
amendment
protected
activity
that
is
religious
liberty
is
affected
by
the
regulations
that
we’re
challenging
and
in
an
addition,
i
submit
your
honors,
based
on
the
history
that
we
have
disclosed
in
our
brief
that
the
i-o
conscientious
objector
during
war
time
is
a
suspect
class
that
has
no
access
to
the
political
forums
that
is
at
the
mercy
of
public
resentment
as
the
history
discloses
and
there
has
been
ill-treated
consistently
throughout
their
history
and
deserves
the
protections
of
the
suspect
classification.
thank
you.
