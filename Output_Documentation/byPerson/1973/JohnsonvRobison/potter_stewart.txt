justice
potter
stewart
doesn’t
it
also
include
some
other
people,
public
health
people?
justice
potter
stewart
but
another,
by
another
law
by
reference.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
it
was
always
intended
to
extend
these
benefits
to
draftees,
wasn’t
it?
the
only
question
before
congress
was
whether
as
you
understood
what
you
say
whether
not
to
also
include
volunteers?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
are
arguably
by
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
would
still
be
made
if
the
benefits
have
been
limited
to
draftees
as
they
say
that
there’s
nothing
in
the
--
no
purpose
of
congress
to
provide
an
incentive
for
enlistment
or
volunteering
can
be
served
when
you
just
give
these
benefits
to
draftees?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
them
were
killed
or
wounded
in
the
line
of
duty
during
the
period
of
1965
to
1973?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
is
that
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
said
in
all
respects
but
one,
i
am
suggesting
that
there
maybe
at
least
two.
justice
potter
stewart
the
federal
government
isn’t
inevitably
their
employers
during
this
period
of
service?
sometimes,
i
guess
it
is,
but
often
it’s
for
state
or
municipal
or
county
hospital
or
institution
and
i
suppose
sometimes
for
private
one,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
might
have
blue
cross?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
claim
is,
as
i
understand
that
at
least
that
it’s
under
inclusive
and
that
was
a
basic
claim
wasn’t
it,
in
wells?
justice
potter
stewart
under
inclusive?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
think
that’s
an
unfair
way
to
characterize
the
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
i
don’t
believe
that
complainant
didn’t
ask
for
writ
of
mandamus,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
by
contrast
to
the
previous
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
less
than
$10,000?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
are
talking
about
$8,000
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
10,
not
and
but
you
don’t
--
in
your
brief
at
least
you
relegate
this
to
the
footnote?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
asserted
jurisdiction
under
1361?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
in
the
preview
case
they
would’ve
seek
mandamus?
justice
potter
stewart
if
in
this
case
say,
it’s
simply
added
that
in
the
prayer
of
their
complaint,
you
find
no
difficulties
under
1361?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
if
you
know
there’s
good
deal
in
the
legal
leadership
about
a
writ
on
nature
but
on
a
writ
of
mandamus,
whether
or
not
that
means
what
mandamus
we
all
learned
in
law
school
not
just
the
ministerial
act.
