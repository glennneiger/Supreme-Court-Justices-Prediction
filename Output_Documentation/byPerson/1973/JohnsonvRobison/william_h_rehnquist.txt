justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
norton,
i
take
it
that
judge
geraghty
rejected
the
disposition
of
the
government's
that
there
is
a
rational
distinction
between
those
who
were
subject
to
being
assigned
to
hazardous
combat
duty
and
those
who
were
not
on
the
grounds
that
congress
had
intended
to
rely
on
that
distinction,
that
it
probably
could
have,
but
i
gather
he
said
that
wasn’t
what
congress
had
in
mind.
what’s
the
government’s
position
with
respect
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it’s
a
question
of
what
congress
might
have
reasonably
considered
not
what
the
legislative
history
shows
they
did
in
fact
consider?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
a
draftee
gets
free
room
and
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
because
you
made
that
argument
already
that
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
a
draftee
is
subject
to,
if
you
treat
that
as
a
point,
i
don’t
really
see
how
can
you
separately
treat
the
fact
that
all
--
that
it’s
some
kind
of
a
detraction
from
the
room
and
board
that
the
same
thing
happens
or
if
you
are
talking
strictly
in
terms
of
compensation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rosenberg,
were
these
benefits
available
to
people
in
the
service
between
roughly
the
time
that
the
korean
war
ended
and
the
time
that
vietnam
war
started?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
don’t
think
that
quite
answers
my
question
because
i
take
it
from
what
you
say
that
although
looking
back,
post
1966,
we
can
say
that
everybody
has
been
covered.
i
take
it
if
one
looked
at
the
period
of
the
late
50’s
and
early
60’s,
the
veterans
then
serving
were
not
by
any
law
enforce
while
they
were
serving
in
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
say
they
could’ve
given
less
money
to
the
conscientious
objectors.
it's
hard
for
me
to
figure
out
how
they
could
constitutionally
do
that
if
you’re
right
and
still
not
be
able
to
give
no
money?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
take
the
example
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
when
it
was
first
passed.
as
i
recall
the
recital
of
the
legislative
purpose
there
was
that
interstate
commerce
was
being
disrupted
because
of
strikes
and
so
forth.
now,
do
you
think
it
have
been
open
to
somebody
to
come
in
on
that
legislative
history
and
say,
well
in
fact
there
was
no
disruption
of
interstate
commerce
here
and
so
this
doesn’t
lead
the
purpose
that
congress
said
when
it
was
enacted
so
we
can’t
apply
the
--
even
though
by
its
terms
it
might
apply?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it’s
certainly
different
than
some
of
our
cases
you
have
said
about
equal
protection
of
any
conceivable
set
of
facts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
be
there
at
sure
that
in
a
legislation
we
were
dealing
in
the
other
case
is
they
weren’t
stated
purposes,
but
that
the
court
just
didn’t
think
they
were
important?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
tuition
over
and
above
that
or
is
that
the
total?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
norton
as
i
understand
the
law
that's
established
by
decision
of
this
court
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
does
not
confer
on
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction
on
this
court
if
it’s
not
a
present
by
some
other
jurisdictional
grant.
have
there
been
any
decisions
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
to
1361,
the
mandamus
section
confers
an
independent
grant
of
jurisdiction?
