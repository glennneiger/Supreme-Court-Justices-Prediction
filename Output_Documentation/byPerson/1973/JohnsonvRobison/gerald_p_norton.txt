the
ultimate
question
on
the
merits
as
i
indicated
before
is
the
same
here
and
the
same
jurisdictional
questions
arise.
after
being
classified
i-o
which
means
that
a
conscientious
objector
opposed
to
any
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
even
in
noncombatant
duty.
robison
took
a
job
in
may
1968
at
a
hospital
in
boston
where
he
resided,
he
was
going
to
school.
under
procedures,
i’ll
describe
later,
he
asked
the
local
board
to
sign
him
to
that
hospital
for
his
alternative
service
required
under
the
selective
service
laws
which
he
was
entitled
to
in
lieu
of
induction
having
claimed
his
exemption
from
service
as
a
conscientious
objector.
in
august
1968,
the
local
board
ordered
him
to
work
at
the
hospital
he
had
selected,
effective
the
preceding
may
and
he
would
have,
at
that
time
been
classified
i-w
which
is
a
classification
of
people
who
were
i-o
and
have
been
ordered
to
do
alternative
service
and
i
may
use
those
terms
for
convenience.
two
years
later
in
may
1970,
he
finished
his
alternative
service
and
quit
his
hospital
job
and
having
continued
at
school
at
night
he
graduated
from
college
in
1970
as
well.
in
1971,
he
applied,
he
got
to
law
school
and
he
applied
to
the
va
for
educational
benefits
under
chapter
34
of
title
38
(b)
1966
veterans’
readjustment
benefits
act.
the
va
decided
that
he
was
ineligible
because
he
did
not
come
within
the
statutory
definition
of
eligible
veterans
to
whom
such
benefits
are
made
available
because
he
had
not
been
on
active
duty
as
those
terms
are
defined
in
title
38.
in
february
1972,
a
complaint
was
filed
against
the
va
and
the
administrator
as
a
class
action
for
all
persons
who
had
served
the
alternative
service
and
completed
their
service,
and
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
in
extending
benefits
to
veterans
of
military
service,
but
not
to
persons
who
had
rendered
alternative
service.
they
also
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
that
plaintiff
and
members
of
the
class
were
entitled
to
receive
these
benefits.
no
injunctions
or
other
specific
relief
was
sought.
now,
the
ultimate
question
here
as
in
hernandez
on
the
merits
is
whether
it
is
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
extend
certain
fringe
benefits
to
a
specified
category
of
federal
employee,
namely
certain
members
of
the
uniform
services
and
not
to
extend
them
to
anyone
else,
who
might
share
some
of
the
circumstances
for
a
background
in
common
with
some
of
those
receiving
benefits.
i
think
it
might
help
to
provide
some
background
about
the
statutory
scheme
involved
here.
congress
has
of
course
in
number
of
specifically
enumerated
powers
pertaining
to
the
armed
forces
and
under
the
constitution
and
for
at
least
as
long
as
this
country
has
required
the
services
of
armed
forces
and
its
employee,
it
has
exercised
these
powers
to
provide
benefits
to
veterans
of
various
types
of
veterans
of
military
service.
the
first
veterans’
pension
law
was
passed
in
1789
for
example
for
veterans
of
the
revolutionary
war
and
the
history
of
veterans’
benefits
maybe
traced
ever
since.
at
present,
congress
has
established
a
number
of
programs
for
veterans
of
military
service.
some
are
contractual
in
nature.
some
are
non-contractual,
involving
essentially
fortuitous
benefits.
they
have
a
variety
of
eligibility
restrictions
and
each
one
has
to
be
taken
separately.
we
deal
here
only
with
the
program
concerning
educational
benefits
under
chapter
34.
now,
the
educational
benefits
program
reflects
a
number
of
policy
decisions
by
congress
in
1966.
one
of
course
was
the
level
of
benefits
which
is
not
as
generous
as
the
benefits
provided
to
veterans
of
korean
war
or
world
war
ii.
the
benefits
available
to
anyone
of
these
plaintiffs
is
under
the
law
--
under
most
circumstance
is
not
to
be
likely
to
exceed
$10,000
because
of
adjustment
for
the
number
of
dependents
and
you
would
need
a
great
number
of
dependents
to
be
entitled
to
$10,000
over
the
course
of
the
program.
the
program
is
not
intended
to
subsidize
education,
but
merely
provide
partial
assistance.
it’s
available,
however,
without
regard
to
the
needs
for
the
benefits
and
it’s
also
available
without
regard
to
whether
your
education
has
in
fact
been
disrupted
or
hindered.
one
limitation
in
the
statute
is
that
you
be
a
veteran
as
defined
in
title
38
which
means
a
person
who
has
served
active
duty
aligned
in
military
forces,
the
air
force,
and
who
has
not
been
dishonorably
discharged.
the
1966
act
further
limits
the
category
of
eligible
veteran
for
the
purpose
of
chapter
34,
the
educational
benefits
to
a
person
who
has
more
than
180
days
of
active
duty,
again,
a
person
who
was
discharged
under
the
conditions
other
than
dishonorable
or
of
discharged
for
a
service-connected
disability.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it
does.
the
statute
itself
does
not
in
terms
extend
benefits
to
the
public
health
service
or
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
under
the
1957
version
of
title
38,
active
duty
was
defined
in
a
way
as
to
include
active
duty
by
commissioned
officers
of
those
two
organizations
within
the
terms
active
duty
for
veterans’
benefits
purposes.
so
that
unless
congress
took
affirmative
action
to
exclude
them,
they
would
be
covered.
now,
this
reflects
a
historic
equation
of
service
in
these
two
organizations
to
military
service
that
goes
back
to
world
war
i
days.
these
organizations
have
historically
been
at
from
time
to
time
under
the
direct
control
of
the
military.
they
have
reserved
course,
they
have
military
structures,
they
are
at
times
subject
to
military
duty
and
for
purposes
of
pay
and
allowances
they
are
included
with
the
military
in
title
37
covering
compensation
of
the
uniform
services.
we
--
the
statutory
background
is
rather
detailed
and
we
haven’t
developed
it
in
our
brief
and
if
the
court
would
like,
we’d
be
happy
to
submit
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
that
point,
but
there
was
no
affirmative
provision
of
the
1966
act
which
dealt
with
those
categories.
there
were
several
other
decisions
made
in
1966
by
congress.
it
was
a
question
whether
to
extend
these
benefits
only
to
people
who
had
active
duty
in
the
military
zone
or
hostilities,
but
the
purpose
was
broader
than
rewarding
such
service
so
that
the
act
is
broader.
there
was
a
question
whether
to
limit
benefits
to
draftees
or
the
men
who
had
enlisted
and
again
the
statute
had
various
purposes
which
ended
up
being
served
by
including
both.
as
i
understand,
the
claims
in
these
cases
if
the
statute
had
been
narrower
and
had
not
extended
benefits
as
far
as
it
does,
we
might
not
have
a
case
here.
the
position
is
that
congress
should
have
indeed
was
constitutionally
obliged
to
go
even
further
than
it
did.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right.
it
was
a
--
but
one
purpose
[voice
overlap]
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that’s
true.
if
you
look
one
purpose
and
try
to
measure
all
of
the
benefits
in
terms
of
that
one
purpose
that
it
might
be
a
problem,
but
there
are
multiple
purposes
here
and
each
recipient
of
the
benefits
need
not
be
justified
by
each
of
the
purposes.
i
think
there’s
been
a
tendency
to
crisscross
the
lines.
essentially,
the
plaintiff's
case
comes
down
to
the
contention
that
looking
only
at
people
who
were
drafted
into
military
service
and
conscientious
objectors
who
performed
alternative
service,
there
are
absolutely
no
factual
distinctions
between
the
nature
of
the
service
rendered
that
would
permit
the
congress
rationally
to
conclude
that
it
was
an
inappropriate
action
to
extend
benefits
to
veterans
of
military
service
and
not
to
anyone
else.
now,
we
think
it
claimed
that
congress
took
a
different
view
that
congress
realized
that
there
were
a
number
of
unique
and
distinctive
features
of
military
service
which
could
have
supported
this
distinction
so
that
the
distinction
cannot
be
said
to
be
illusory
or
utterly
lacking
in
substance
or
any
of
the
other
terms
that
this
court
has
said
must
be
supported
in
order
to
say
that
the
classification
is
unconstitutional.
let
me
turn
now
to
some
of
the
distinctions
that
congress
had
in
mind
either
explicitly
or
in
the
nature
of
things,
it
could
recently
have
--
had
in
mind.
for
one
thing,
someone
who
was
drafted
into
the
military
service
has
an
obligation
of
six
years,
four
of
which
after
active
duty
are
in
the
reserves.
the
person
who
serves
alternative
service
as
a
conscientious
objector
has
a
maximum
obligation
of
two
years.
now,
that
reserve
obligation
is
not
merely
a
theoretical
possibility
as
it
can
involve
the
burdens
of
training
in
weekend
or
summer
time
duty
or
other
duty
and
congress
had
in
mind
particularly
in
1965
and
1966
when
this
act
was
being
considered,
the
fact
that
in
only
a
few
years
before
it
had
been
necessary
to
call
up
the
reserves
in
connection
with
the
berlin
crisis.
so
this
was
something
that
was
explicitly
discussed
and
it’s
a
very
significant
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
service
because
as
congress
indicated
having
this
additional
liability
hanging
over
his
head,
a
person
in
the
military
has
a
kind
of
disruption
and
continuing
disruption
of
his
plans
and
his
educational
plans.
now,
there
is
the
additional
fact
that
service
in
the
military
involves
the
possibility
of
being
sent
anywhere
in
the
world
to
face
a
variety
of
dangerous
or
hostile
conditions.
in
the
district
court,
robison
agreed
that
it
was
unquestionable
that
military
service
was
a
hazardous
and
vigorous
demanding
than
alternative
service.
there
is
been
some
suggestion
in
the
briefs
that
conscientious
objectors
at
times
do
serve
abroad,
but
in
fact
that
it’s
the
policy
of
the
selective
service
and
was
the
policy
not
to
order
anyone
to
report
for
work
overseas.
persons
who
ended
up
doing
alternative
duty
overseas
were
ones
who
had
indicated
a
willingness
to
work
for
one
of
the
--
or
established
organizations
who
did
overseas
service
and
knew
that
that
was
what
they’re
going
to
do
and
what
they’re
getting
into
and
even
then
they
would
not
be
assigned
overseas,
but
would
be
assigned
to
work
for
a
group
base
in
this
country
who
then
might
use
their
services
overseas.
there
is
also
a
very
substantial
difference
in
the
way
in
which
these
two
groups
select
or
influence
the
work
they
do.
i
think
the
influence
that
a
draftee
has
over
where
he
works
and
what
he
does
is
notoriously
limited,
if
there
is
any
at
all.
he
does
what
he
is
told
and
goes
where
he
is
told.
however,
under
the
regulations
that
were
in
existence
in
1965
and
1966
and
continued
until
1971,
a
person
doing
alternative
service
had
considerable
opportunity
to
influence
those
decisions.
it
could
as
robison
did
submit
up
to
three
types
of
employment
that
he
was
qualified
and
willing
to
do.
if
the
local
board
found
anyone
of
them
appropriate,
it
would
then
order
him
to
do
one
of
those
things.
if
they
did
not
find
anyone
appropriate,
then
they
would
come
up
with
three
and
submit
them
to
the
registrant
and
if
he
didn’t
find
anyone
of
those
satisfactory,
then
they
would
have
a
conference
with
the
state
director.
and
if
they
still
couldn’t
work
out
something
and
finally
the
local
board
did
have
the
authority
to
order
the
registrant
to
do
work,
but
only
with
the
approval
of
the
national
director.
this
is
a
far
cry
from
the
situation
presented
to
a
military
draftee.
that
man
understandably
that
a
selective
--
that
a
conscientious
objector
who
was
going
to
alternative
service
had
much
greater
opportunity
to
fit
his
service
inconsistent
with
other
obligations
he
might
have
such
as
pursuing
his
education
as
mr.
robison
was
able
to
do.
of
course
the
pay,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
one
does
apprehension
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
quotes
a
what
is
cited
as
a
regulation
of
the
selective
service
which
permitted
local
boards
to
assign
and
abruptly
reassign
persons
who
were
doing
alternative
service
anywhere
at
anytime
even
in
combat
zones.
now,
selective
service
in
knows
of
no
such
regulation.
it
is
not
contained
in
the
regulation
that
is
cited
in
a
district
court’s
opinion
and
there
was
none
such
that
was
into
factoring
the
period
that
congress
was
considering
this
act
or
since.
we
simply
don’t
know
where
it
came
from
and
i
think
there’s
a
reference
on
it
to
one
of
the
briefs
which
is
based
on
the
district
court’s
use
of
it
in
the
opinion,
but
again,
there’s
no
way
we
can
track
it
down.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
we’re
not
saying
it’s
only
a
distinction
between
those
subject
to
hazardous
combat
duty.
we’re
saying
that
even
if
you
look
at
all
military
draftees,
the
nature
of
the
disruption
of
their
lives
was
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
different
from
that
of
anyone
else
who
was
affected
by
the
selective
service
laws
and
that
congress
could
rationally
conclude
that
given
these
various
distinctions
that
it
was
appropriate
to
extend
benefits
to
the
military
draftees.
even
if
you
were
to
accept
that
the
contention
that
alternative
service
veterans,
if
you
will,
had
some
disruption
of
their
educations
and
hence
had
some
need
of
the
same
kind
of
benefit,
i
think
it
is
permissible
certainly
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
jefferson
against
hackney
for
congress
to
distinguish
between
different
categories
of
people
who
might
share
in
some
general
way
a
characteristic
and
extend
benefits
in
a
differential
fashion
as
long
as
the
distinction,
the
classification
is
not
altogether
illusory
or
utterly
lacking
in
any
rational
meaning.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
say
that
the
test
that
has
been
announced
in
this
court’s
decisions
is
the
former
that
could
it
rationally
have
been
conceived
--
is
there
a
state
of
facts
that
might
have
been
conceived
to
justify
this
distinction?
but
we
say
in
addition
that
there
were
distinctions
that
were
directly
addressed
by
congress
which
support
this
distinction.
and
another
one
that
congress
specifically
mentioned
was
the
fact
that
military
veterans
have
been
subjected
to
deprivations
of
liberty
and
loss
of
freedom,
inherent
in
military
discipline
and
military
life,
is
subject
to
the
universal
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
and
this
kind
of
existence
for
two
or
more
years
creates
additional
transition
problems
in
returning
to
civilian
life.
there
is
also
the
related
to
a
fact
that
in
the
military
someone
may
after
serving
be
discharged
on
grounds
other
than
the
honorable
indeed
in
dishonorable
grounds
because
of
things
done
in
the
military.
whereas
someone
who
was
doing
alternative
service
does
not
face
that
possibility
if
they
complete
their
two
years
even
though
they
may
have
done
something
which
would’ve
warranted
a
dishonorable
discharged
in
the
military.
they
have
no
such
adverse
consequence
attaching
to
their
service
and
this
has
a
direct
bearing
in
this
case
because
a
veteran
of
military
service
served
is
otherwise
within
the
definition
of
an
eligible
veteran
but
for
some
reason
was
dishonorably
discharged
would
not
be
entitled
to
these
benefits
and
if
under
the
district
court’s
decision
here
if
someone
who
did
alternative
service
committed
the
same
offense,
they
would
be
entitled
to
it,
so
that
the
result
of
the
decision
below
is
to
place
alternative
service
people
in
a
somewhat
more
favored
position.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
you
get
a
piece
of
paper
saying
you
have
satisfied
your,
in
your
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
it
can
only
be
either
a
completion
or
an
incomplete
if
you
haven’t
completed
it;
they
can
order
you
to
continue
until
you
do.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
think
for
some
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
selective
service,
i
think
sends
you
a
piece
of
paper
that
certifies
that
you
have
completed
your
alternative
service.
there
is
a
another
point
along
this
line
that
--
another
misapprehension
of
the
district
court
is
argued
and
was
stated
by
the
court
that
a
person
in
alternative
service
could
be
subject
to
prosecution
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
reasonable
order
of
his
employer.
now,
this
was
not
a
part
of
the
scheme,
the
regulatory
scheme
when
congress
was
considering
the
veterans’
benefits
act.
this
is
under
a
regulation
and
it
was
not
adopted
until
1971
and
it
can
have
no
bearing
of
course
on
the
rationality
of
the
judgment
made
by
congress
in
1966.
similarly,
there
are
repeated
references
to
guidelines
issued
by
the
director
of
the
selective
service
to
the
effect
that
the
disruption
of
alternative
service
person’s
life
should
be
comparable
to
that
of
someone
in
the
military.
again,
these
were
not
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme
when
congress
was
considering
the
1966
act.
they
were
introduced
at
a
later
time,
they
were
not
of
binding
a
legal
effect
and
indeed,
one
court
has
held
that
they
were
questionable
legal
significance
in
any
event.
of
course,
another
distinction
is
to
pay.
a
draftee
during
let’s
say
the
period
that
mr.
robison
started
work
was
paid
i
think,
at
the
rate
of
about
$100
a
month.
mr.
robison
says
that
he
started
work
at
$80
a
week.
there’s
no
indication
in
the
record
as
to
any
increases
he
may
have
had
after
that
time,
any
fringe
benefits,
or
allowances
or
other
compensation.
so
that
a
draftee
is
in
especially
difficult
position
to
try
to
save
money
and/or
to
finance
education
even
if
he
had
the
time
to
do
it
while
he
was
in
the
service.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
there
were
not
in
1965
and
1966
when
congress
was
considering
this
act.
at
a
later
time,
another,
one
of
these
guidelines
of
the
selective
service
director
suggested
that
the
pay
should
be
comparable
to
that
or
someone
in
the
military,
but
it
is
a
very
general
statement
and
it’s
not
clear
to
what
effects
if
at
all,
it
was
applied.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it’s
not
statutory.
the
statute
contains
none
of
these
limitations.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that’s
true,
but
it’s
free
room
and
board
where
the
military
wants
them
to
live
which
maybe
at
military
base
in
the
far
reaches
of
the
world
and
a
place
where
he
is
unable
to
shape
his
life,
so
as
to
pursue
his
education.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
don’t
know
whether
on
this
record
whether
any
of
these
alternative
service
people
end
up
getting
room
and
board.
and
it
can’t
be
assumed
that
they
were
getting
--
generally
getting
it
or
generally
not.
the
congress
might
have
reasonably
concluded
that
the
draftee's
situation
was
sufficiently
distinct
if
they
justified
these
benefits.
of
course,
as
this
court
has
indicated
the
question
is
not
whether
congress
has
assumptions
in
these
regards
were
actually
warranted
by
the
facts,
it
was
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
determination
for
congress
to
make.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that’s
right
and
that
was
what
i
was
adverting
to
earlier.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
any,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
just
a
few
comments.
with
respect
to
the
last
remark
about
the
public
attitude
toward
conscientious
objectors
and
suggestion
that
congress
had
a
purpose
of
somehow
penalizing
people
who
were
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
of
any
such
intention
under
laying
the
classification
embodied
in
the
1966
statute,
that
is
conceded
in
the
plaintiff’s
brief.
what
they
have
done
is
gone
back
to
a
various
things
said
in
world
war
ii,
very
different
circumstances,
different
public
attitude
towards
war,
towards
conscientious
objection.
the
attitudes
and
views
expressed
then
by
the
congressmen
have
no
bearing
on
what
happen
in
1966.
indeed,
i
think
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
the
congress
has
demonstrated
an
increasing
degree
of
accommodation
to
the
views
of
conscientious
objectors
in
the
statutes
that
have
been
enacted
as
time
has
gone
on.
i
think
it’s
wholly
unsupported
contention
to
make.
the
comment
concerning
the
statement
of
purposes
and
the
act
underlines
one
of
the
deficiencies
of
the
district
court's
approach
in
this
case
we
believe
and
he
took
a
very
strict
and
narrow
reading
of
the
purposes.
now,
this
court
has
never
said
that
the
court
is
confined
to
an
explicit
statement
of
purposes
in
considering
the
validity
of
a
statute.
indeed
in
the
moreno
case,
the
food
stamp
case
last
year,
the
court
first
considered
the
explicit
purposes
that
were
stated
and
then
went
on
to
consider
whether
they
were
other
possible
purposes
that
might
have
justified
the
statute.
it's
a
perfectly
proper
and
established
approach.
now,
there
is
one
continuing
misapprehension
that
pervades
the
argument
on
the
other
side
and
that
is
that
there
is
in
the
statute
an
exclusion.
the
statute
is
not
in
terms
to
exclude
anyone,
all
it
does,
is
extend
benefits
to
a
defined
category
of
persons
who
rendered
military
service.
people
who
rendered
alternative
service
are
not
the
only
people
who
denied
benefits;
everyone
else
who
is
not
within
that
category
is
denied
benefits.
someone
who
has
conscientious
objection
to
participation
in
war
and
who
does
not
happen
to
fall
within
the
statutory
exemption,
and
therefore,
he
goes
to
prison
instead
as
mr.
gillette
chose
to
do.
his
life
was
disrupted
by
the
selective
service
laws
but
he
is
finally
not
entitled
to
benefits.
so
it
is
wrong
to
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
the
claim,
but
i
think
it
is
wrong
to
characterize
the
statute
as
carving
out
an
exclusion
of
any
definable
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
definable
group.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
they
say
they
should
be
cover
is
as
well,
that’s
true.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
true
and
i
have
that
in
mind
and
i
think
we
come
back
in
that
case
to
the
--
your
question
that
was
raised
whether
it
would
be
sufficient
if
there
could
be
any
distinction
between
these
two
categories
and
whether
then
it
would
be
permissible
to
grant
a
different
level
of
benefits
to
military
veterans
than
to
alternative
service
selection.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
he
would
have
the
same
and
he
could
argue
that
it
is
irrational
to
cut
it
off
at
179
or
180
days.
any
statute
that
extends
benefits
or
imposes
restrains,
that
draws
line
is
bound
to
create
people
on
the
other
side
of
that
line.
these
are
legislative
decisions,
these
are
policy
judgments
which
we
feel
are
within
congress'
power
to
make.
if
the
claim
being
asserted
is
as
persuasive
and
as
meritorious
as
the
plaintiffs
argue,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
if
it
were
addressed
to
congress
so
that
congress
will
focus
specifically
on
it,
it
would
be
turned
down.
they’re
asking
this
court
to
do
something
that
congress
has
not
explicitly
ever
done
itself.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
as
i
indicated
in
the
hernandez
that
larson
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
have
raised
the
question
whether
under
the
law
he
would
ever
be
entitled
to
as
much
as
$10,000.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
was
yes,
that
was
asserted
below.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it’s
yes,
it’s
contended
in
our
briefs
and
we
say
the
date
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
they
have
relied
on
the
mandamus
statute,
but
they're
seeking
of
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
we
say
yes
that
is
inappropriate,
for
that
offers
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
but
this
is
not
a
case
that
is
within
the
terms
of
that
statute
as
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
it
asked
only
for
declaratory
relief.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right,
and
of
course
that
declaratory
judgment
statute,
this
court
has
said
does
not
grant
jurisdiction
but
really
provides
a
remedy.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
would
be
going
--
i
think
beyond
the
bounds
of
prior
decisions,
it’s
really
in
jurisdictional
amount.
what
they
are
seeking
in
this
case
is
a
claim
to
a
certain
amount
of
money
help.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it’s
less
than
$10,000.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
understand
and
they
are
trying
to
boost
up
the
monitory
value
by
relying
upon
consequential
events
that
may
or
may
not
happen
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
they
vary
depending
upon
the
size
of
the
family.
originally,
in
1966
the
basic
allotment
for
an
individual
who
is
full
time
student
was
a
$130.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
for
up
to
36
months
of
education
and
that
is
since
twice
have
been
increased
in
the
current
base
figure
i
believe
is
$220.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
again,
36
months
of
period.
now,
if
you
have
dependents
--
a
married,
i
don’t
know
if
particularly
goes
by
numbers
or
spouse
but
there
is
a
scale
that
increases
the
benefits
depending
on
the
number
of
dependents.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
the
total.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
something
in
that
order
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
think
that
is
because
our
principle
reliance
is
on
211.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
say
that
does
not
apply
here
either
because
we’re
not
seeking
relief
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
they
did
there
but
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
relief
they’re
seeking
is
not
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus,
we
don’t
believe.
as
mr.
justice
marshall
indicated
that
it’s
traditionally
involved
in
ministerial
duty
involving
a
clear
legal
right
in
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
but
on
the
face
of
the
statute
if
they
have
clearly
no
legal
right,
they
have
to
go
beyond
the
statute
to
make
their
claim.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
not
entirely
sure,
i
think
there
may
be
some
lower
court
decisions
about
ways,
but
i
think
it
is
in
construed
by
some
courts
as
granting
jurisdiction
within
its
rather
narrow
limits
if
it
is
a
case
appropriate
for
that
kind
of
relief.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
our
position.
i
would
just
conclude
with
one
comment
about
the
first
amendment
argument.
we
did
address
the
first
amendment
issues
in
our
brief
in
hernandez.
we
did
not
explicitly
address
them
in
a
reply
brief
in
our
brief
in
robison,
but
they
are
covered
there
and
i
would
say
briefly
that
unlike
the
situation
in
sherbert
against
verner,
where
the
denial
of
employment
compensation
constituted
a
continuing
pressure
upon
the
claimant
to
forgo
or
religious
scruples
and
to
work
on
saturday.
here
there
is
no
such
continuing
pressure.
a
decision
was
made
by
mr.
robison
back
in
1968
to
take
advantage
of
an
exemption
from
military
service
that
congress
had
made
available
and
that
is
the
source
of
his
present
situation
and
there
is
no
continuing
pressure
on
him.
he
claims
--
does
not
claim
that
the
possibility
of
receiving
benefits
exerted
any
pressure
on
him.
in
fact,
if
it
did
exert
pressure
it
wasn’t
very
effective
pressure
because
he
went
ahead
anyway.
thank
you.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
the
ultimate
question
on
the
merits
as
i
indicated
before
is
the
same
here
and
the
same
jurisdictional
questions
arise.
after
being
classified
i-o
which
means
that
a
conscientious
objector
opposed
to
any
participation
in
war
in
any
form,
even
in
noncombatant
duty.
robison
took
a
job
in
may
1968
at
a
hospital
in
boston
where
he
resided,
he
was
going
to
school.
under
procedures,
i’ll
describe
later,
he
asked
the
local
board
to
sign
him
to
that
hospital
for
his
alternative
service
required
under
the
selective
service
laws
which
he
was
entitled
to
in
lieu
of
induction
having
claimed
his
exemption
from
service
as
a
conscientious
objector.
in
august
1968,
the
local
board
ordered
him
to
work
at
the
hospital
he
had
selected,
effective
the
preceding
may
and
he
would
have,
at
that
time
been
classified
i-w
which
is
a
classification
of
people
who
were
i-o
and
have
been
ordered
to
do
alternative
service
and
i
may
use
those
terms
for
convenience.
two
years
later
in
may
1970,
he
finished
his
alternative
service
and
quit
his
hospital
job
and
having
continued
at
school
at
night
he
graduated
from
college
in
1970
as
well.
in
1971,
he
applied,
he
got
to
law
school
and
he
applied
to
the
va
for
educational
benefits
under
chapter
34
of
title
38
(b)
1966
veterans’
readjustment
benefits
act.
the
va
decided
that
he
was
ineligible
because
he
did
not
come
within
the
statutory
definition
of
eligible
veterans
to
whom
such
benefits
are
made
available
because
he
had
not
been
on
active
duty
as
those
terms
are
defined
in
title
38.
in
february
1972,
a
complaint
was
filed
against
the
va
and
the
administrator
as
a
class
action
for
all
persons
who
had
served
the
alternative
service
and
completed
their
service,
and
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
in
extending
benefits
to
veterans
of
military
service,
but
not
to
persons
who
had
rendered
alternative
service.
they
also
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
that
plaintiff
and
members
of
the
class
were
entitled
to
receive
these
benefits.
no
injunctions
or
other
specific
relief
was
sought.
now,
the
ultimate
question
here
as
in
hernandez
on
the
merits
is
whether
it
is
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
extend
certain
fringe
benefits
to
a
specified
category
of
federal
employee,
namely
certain
members
of
the
uniform
services
and
not
to
extend
them
to
anyone
else,
who
might
share
some
of
the
circumstances
for
a
background
in
common
with
some
of
those
receiving
benefits.
i
think
it
might
help
to
provide
some
background
about
the
statutory
scheme
involved
here.
congress
has
of
course
in
number
of
specifically
enumerated
powers
pertaining
to
the
armed
forces
and
under
the
constitution
and
for
at
least
as
long
as
this
country
has
required
the
services
of
armed
forces
and
its
employee,
it
has
exercised
these
powers
to
provide
benefits
to
veterans
of
various
types
of
veterans
of
military
service.
the
first
veterans’
pension
law
was
passed
in
1789
for
example
for
veterans
of
the
revolutionary
war
and
the
history
of
veterans’
benefits
maybe
traced
ever
since.
at
present,
congress
has
established
a
number
of
programs
for
veterans
of
military
service.
some
are
contractual
in
nature.
some
are
non-contractual,
involving
essentially
fortuitous
benefits.
they
have
a
variety
of
eligibility
restrictions
and
each
one
has
to
be
taken
separately.
we
deal
here
only
with
the
program
concerning
educational
benefits
under
chapter
34.
now,
the
educational
benefits
program
reflects
a
number
of
policy
decisions
by
congress
in
1966.
one
of
course
was
the
level
of
benefits
which
is
not
as
generous
as
the
benefits
provided
to
veterans
of
korean
war
or
world
war
ii.
the
benefits
available
to
anyone
of
these
plaintiffs
is
under
the
law
--
under
most
circumstance
is
not
to
be
likely
to
exceed
$10,000
because
of
adjustment
for
the
number
of
dependents
and
you
would
need
a
great
number
of
dependents
to
be
entitled
to
$10,000
over
the
course
of
the
program.
the
program
is
not
intended
to
subsidize
education,
but
merely
provide
partial
assistance.
it’s
available,
however,
without
regard
to
the
needs
for
the
benefits
and
it’s
also
available
without
regard
to
whether
your
education
has
in
fact
been
disrupted
or
hindered.
one
limitation
in
the
statute
is
that
you
be
a
veteran
as
defined
in
title
38
which
means
a
person
who
has
served
active
duty
aligned
in
military
forces,
the
air
force,
and
who
has
not
been
dishonorably
discharged.
the
1966
act
further
limits
the
category
of
eligible
veteran
for
the
purpose
of
chapter
34,
the
educational
benefits
to
a
person
who
has
more
than
180
days
of
active
duty,
again,
a
person
who
was
discharged
under
the
conditions
other
than
dishonorable
or
of
discharged
for
a
service-connected
disability.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it
does.
the
statute
itself
does
not
in
terms
extend
benefits
to
the
public
health
service
or
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
under
the
1957
version
of
title
38,
active
duty
was
defined
in
a
way
as
to
include
active
duty
by
commissioned
officers
of
those
two
organizations
within
the
terms
active
duty
for
veterans’
benefits
purposes.
so
that
unless
congress
took
affirmative
action
to
exclude
them,
they
would
be
covered.
now,
this
reflects
a
historic
equation
of
service
in
these
two
organizations
to
military
service
that
goes
back
to
world
war
i
days.
these
organizations
have
historically
been
at
from
time
to
time
under
the
direct
control
of
the
military.
they
have
reserved
course,
they
have
military
structures,
they
are
at
times
subject
to
military
duty
and
for
purposes
of
pay
and
allowances
they
are
included
with
the
military
in
title
37
covering
compensation
of
the
uniform
services.
we
--
the
statutory
background
is
rather
detailed
and
we
haven’t
developed
it
in
our
brief
and
if
the
court
would
like,
we’d
be
happy
to
submit
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
that
point,
but
there
was
no
affirmative
provision
of
the
1966
act
which
dealt
with
those
categories.
there
were
several
other
decisions
made
in
1966
by
congress.
it
was
a
question
whether
to
extend
these
benefits
only
to
people
who
had
active
duty
in
the
military
zone
or
hostilities,
but
the
purpose
was
broader
than
rewarding
such
service
so
that
the
act
is
broader.
there
was
a
question
whether
to
limit
benefits
to
draftees
or
the
men
who
had
enlisted
and
again
the
statute
had
various
purposes
which
ended
up
being
served
by
including
both.
as
i
understand,
the
claims
in
these
cases
if
the
statute
had
been
narrower
and
had
not
extended
benefits
as
far
as
it
does,
we
might
not
have
a
case
here.
the
position
is
that
congress
should
have
indeed
was
constitutionally
obliged
to
go
even
further
than
it
did.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right.
it
was
a
--
but
one
purpose
[voice
overlap]
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that’s
true.
if
you
look
one
purpose
and
try
to
measure
all
of
the
benefits
in
terms
of
that
one
purpose
that
it
might
be
a
problem,
but
there
are
multiple
purposes
here
and
each
recipient
of
the
benefits
need
not
be
justified
by
each
of
the
purposes.
i
think
there’s
been
a
tendency
to
crisscross
the
lines.
essentially,
the
plaintiff's
case
comes
down
to
the
contention
that
looking
only
at
people
who
were
drafted
into
military
service
and
conscientious
objectors
who
performed
alternative
service,
there
are
absolutely
no
factual
distinctions
between
the
nature
of
the
service
rendered
that
would
permit
the
congress
rationally
to
conclude
that
it
was
an
inappropriate
action
to
extend
benefits
to
veterans
of
military
service
and
not
to
anyone
else.
now,
we
think
it
claimed
that
congress
took
a
different
view
that
congress
realized
that
there
were
a
number
of
unique
and
distinctive
features
of
military
service
which
could
have
supported
this
distinction
so
that
the
distinction
cannot
be
said
to
be
illusory
or
utterly
lacking
in
substance
or
any
of
the
other
terms
that
this
court
has
said
must
be
supported
in
order
to
say
that
the
classification
is
unconstitutional.
let
me
turn
now
to
some
of
the
distinctions
that
congress
had
in
mind
either
explicitly
or
in
the
nature
of
things,
it
could
recently
have
--
had
in
mind.
for
one
thing,
someone
who
was
drafted
into
the
military
service
has
an
obligation
of
six
years,
four
of
which
after
active
duty
are
in
the
reserves.
the
person
who
serves
alternative
service
as
a
conscientious
objector
has
a
maximum
obligation
of
two
years.
now,
that
reserve
obligation
is
not
merely
a
theoretical
possibility
as
it
can
involve
the
burdens
of
training
in
weekend
or
summer
time
duty
or
other
duty
and
congress
had
in
mind
particularly
in
1965
and
1966
when
this
act
was
being
considered,
the
fact
that
in
only
a
few
years
before
it
had
been
necessary
to
call
up
the
reserves
in
connection
with
the
berlin
crisis.
so
this
was
something
that
was
explicitly
discussed
and
it’s
a
very
significant
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
service
because
as
congress
indicated
having
this
additional
liability
hanging
over
his
head,
a
person
in
the
military
has
a
kind
of
disruption
and
continuing
disruption
of
his
plans
and
his
educational
plans.
now,
there
is
the
additional
fact
that
service
in
the
military
involves
the
possibility
of
being
sent
anywhere
in
the
world
to
face
a
variety
of
dangerous
or
hostile
conditions.
in
the
district
court,
robison
agreed
that
it
was
unquestionable
that
military
service
was
a
hazardous
and
vigorous
demanding
than
alternative
service.
there
is
been
some
suggestion
in
the
briefs
that
conscientious
objectors
at
times
do
serve
abroad,
but
in
fact
that
it’s
the
policy
of
the
selective
service
and
was
the
policy
not
to
order
anyone
to
report
for
work
overseas.
persons
who
ended
up
doing
alternative
duty
overseas
were
ones
who
had
indicated
a
willingness
to
work
for
one
of
the
--
or
established
organizations
who
did
overseas
service
and
knew
that
that
was
what
they’re
going
to
do
and
what
they’re
getting
into
and
even
then
they
would
not
be
assigned
overseas,
but
would
be
assigned
to
work
for
a
group
base
in
this
country
who
then
might
use
their
services
overseas.
there
is
also
a
very
substantial
difference
in
the
way
in
which
these
two
groups
select
or
influence
the
work
they
do.
i
think
the
influence
that
a
draftee
has
over
where
he
works
and
what
he
does
is
notoriously
limited,
if
there
is
any
at
all.
he
does
what
he
is
told
and
goes
where
he
is
told.
however,
under
the
regulations
that
were
in
existence
in
1965
and
1966
and
continued
until
1971,
a
person
doing
alternative
service
had
considerable
opportunity
to
influence
those
decisions.
it
could
as
robison
did
submit
up
to
three
types
of
employment
that
he
was
qualified
and
willing
to
do.
if
the
local
board
found
anyone
of
them
appropriate,
it
would
then
order
him
to
do
one
of
those
things.
if
they
did
not
find
anyone
appropriate,
then
they
would
come
up
with
three
and
submit
them
to
the
registrant
and
if
he
didn’t
find
anyone
of
those
satisfactory,
then
they
would
have
a
conference
with
the
state
director.
and
if
they
still
couldn’t
work
out
something
and
finally
the
local
board
did
have
the
authority
to
order
the
registrant
to
do
work,
but
only
with
the
approval
of
the
national
director.
this
is
a
far
cry
from
the
situation
presented
to
a
military
draftee.
that
man
understandably
that
a
selective
--
that
a
conscientious
objector
who
was
going
to
alternative
service
had
much
greater
opportunity
to
fit
his
service
inconsistent
with
other
obligations
he
might
have
such
as
pursuing
his
education
as
mr.
robison
was
able
to
do.
of
course
the
pay,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
one
does
apprehension
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
quotes
a
what
is
cited
as
a
regulation
of
the
selective
service
which
permitted
local
boards
to
assign
and
abruptly
reassign
persons
who
were
doing
alternative
service
anywhere
at
anytime
even
in
combat
zones.
now,
selective
service
in
knows
of
no
such
regulation.
it
is
not
contained
in
the
regulation
that
is
cited
in
a
district
court’s
opinion
and
there
was
none
such
that
was
into
factoring
the
period
that
congress
was
considering
this
act
or
since.
we
simply
don’t
know
where
it
came
from
and
i
think
there’s
a
reference
on
it
to
one
of
the
briefs
which
is
based
on
the
district
court’s
use
of
it
in
the
opinion,
but
again,
there’s
no
way
we
can
track
it
down.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
we’re
not
saying
it’s
only
a
distinction
between
those
subject
to
hazardous
combat
duty.
we’re
saying
that
even
if
you
look
at
all
military
draftees,
the
nature
of
the
disruption
of
their
lives
was
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
different
from
that
of
anyone
else
who
was
affected
by
the
selective
service
laws
and
that
congress
could
rationally
conclude
that
given
these
various
distinctions
that
it
was
appropriate
to
extend
benefits
to
the
military
draftees.
even
if
you
were
to
accept
that
the
contention
that
alternative
service
veterans,
if
you
will,
had
some
disruption
of
their
educations
and
hence
had
some
need
of
the
same
kind
of
benefit,
i
think
it
is
permissible
certainly
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
jefferson
against
hackney
for
congress
to
distinguish
between
different
categories
of
people
who
might
share
in
some
general
way
a
characteristic
and
extend
benefits
in
a
differential
fashion
as
long
as
the
distinction,
the
classification
is
not
altogether
illusory
or
utterly
lacking
in
any
rational
meaning.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
say
that
the
test
that
has
been
announced
in
this
court’s
decisions
is
the
former
that
could
it
rationally
have
been
conceived
--
is
there
a
state
of
facts
that
might
have
been
conceived
to
justify
this
distinction?
but
we
say
in
addition
that
there
were
distinctions
that
were
directly
addressed
by
congress
which
support
this
distinction.
and
another
one
that
congress
specifically
mentioned
was
the
fact
that
military
veterans
have
been
subjected
to
deprivations
of
liberty
and
loss
of
freedom,
inherent
in
military
discipline
and
military
life,
is
subject
to
the
universal
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
and
this
kind
of
existence
for
two
or
more
years
creates
additional
transition
problems
in
returning
to
civilian
life.
there
is
also
the
related
to
a
fact
that
in
the
military
someone
may
after
serving
be
discharged
on
grounds
other
than
the
honorable
indeed
in
dishonorable
grounds
because
of
things
done
in
the
military.
whereas
someone
who
was
doing
alternative
service
does
not
face
that
possibility
if
they
complete
their
two
years
even
though
they
may
have
done
something
which
would’ve
warranted
a
dishonorable
discharged
in
the
military.
they
have
no
such
adverse
consequence
attaching
to
their
service
and
this
has
a
direct
bearing
in
this
case
because
a
veteran
of
military
service
served
is
otherwise
within
the
definition
of
an
eligible
veteran
but
for
some
reason
was
dishonorably
discharged
would
not
be
entitled
to
these
benefits
and
if
under
the
district
court’s
decision
here
if
someone
who
did
alternative
service
committed
the
same
offense,
they
would
be
entitled
to
it,
so
that
the
result
of
the
decision
below
is
to
place
alternative
service
people
in
a
somewhat
more
favored
position.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
you
get
a
piece
of
paper
saying
you
have
satisfied
your,
in
your
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
it
can
only
be
either
a
completion
or
an
incomplete
if
you
haven’t
completed
it;
they
can
order
you
to
continue
until
you
do.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
think
for
some
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
selective
service,
i
think
sends
you
a
piece
of
paper
that
certifies
that
you
have
completed
your
alternative
service.
there
is
a
another
point
along
this
line
that
--
another
misapprehension
of
the
district
court
is
argued
and
was
stated
by
the
court
that
a
person
in
alternative
service
could
be
subject
to
prosecution
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
reasonable
order
of
his
employer.
now,
this
was
not
a
part
of
the
scheme,
the
regulatory
scheme
when
congress
was
considering
the
veterans’
benefits
act.
this
is
under
a
regulation
and
it
was
not
adopted
until
1971
and
it
can
have
no
bearing
of
course
on
the
rationality
of
the
judgment
made
by
congress
in
1966.
similarly,
there
are
repeated
references
to
guidelines
issued
by
the
director
of
the
selective
service
to
the
effect
that
the
disruption
of
alternative
service
person’s
life
should
be
comparable
to
that
of
someone
in
the
military.
again,
these
were
not
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme
when
congress
was
considering
the
1966
act.
they
were
introduced
at
a
later
time,
they
were
not
of
binding
a
legal
effect
and
indeed,
one
court
has
held
that
they
were
questionable
legal
significance
in
any
event.
of
course,
another
distinction
is
to
pay.
a
draftee
during
let’s
say
the
period
that
mr.
robison
started
work
was
paid
i
think,
at
the
rate
of
about
$100
a
month.
mr.
robison
says
that
he
started
work
at
$80
a
week.
there’s
no
indication
in
the
record
as
to
any
increases
he
may
have
had
after
that
time,
any
fringe
benefits,
or
allowances
or
other
compensation.
so
that
a
draftee
is
in
especially
difficult
position
to
try
to
save
money
and/or
to
finance
education
even
if
he
had
the
time
to
do
it
while
he
was
in
the
service.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
there
were
not
in
1965
and
1966
when
congress
was
considering
this
act.
at
a
later
time,
another,
one
of
these
guidelines
of
the
selective
service
director
suggested
that
the
pay
should
be
comparable
to
that
or
someone
in
the
military,
but
it
is
a
very
general
statement
and
it’s
not
clear
to
what
effects
if
at
all,
it
was
applied.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it’s
not
statutory.
the
statute
contains
none
of
these
limitations.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that’s
true,
but
it’s
free
room
and
board
where
the
military
wants
them
to
live
which
maybe
at
military
base
in
the
far
reaches
of
the
world
and
a
place
where
he
is
unable
to
shape
his
life,
so
as
to
pursue
his
education.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
don’t
know
whether
on
this
record
whether
any
of
these
alternative
service
people
end
up
getting
room
and
board.
and
it
can’t
be
assumed
that
they
were
getting
--
generally
getting
it
or
generally
not.
the
congress
might
have
reasonably
concluded
that
the
draftee's
situation
was
sufficiently
distinct
if
they
justified
these
benefits.
of
course,
as
this
court
has
indicated
the
question
is
not
whether
congress
has
assumptions
in
these
regards
were
actually
warranted
by
the
facts,
it
was
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
determination
for
congress
to
make.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that’s
right
and
that
was
what
i
was
adverting
to
earlier.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
any,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
just
a
few
comments.
with
respect
to
the
last
remark
about
the
public
attitude
toward
conscientious
objectors
and
suggestion
that
congress
had
a
purpose
of
somehow
penalizing
people
who
were
conscientiously
opposed
to
participation
in
war.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
of
any
such
intention
under
laying
the
classification
embodied
in
the
1966
statute,
that
is
conceded
in
the
plaintiff’s
brief.
what
they
have
done
is
gone
back
to
a
various
things
said
in
world
war
ii,
very
different
circumstances,
different
public
attitude
towards
war,
towards
conscientious
objection.
the
attitudes
and
views
expressed
then
by
the
congressmen
have
no
bearing
on
what
happen
in
1966.
indeed,
i
think
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
the
congress
has
demonstrated
an
increasing
degree
of
accommodation
to
the
views
of
conscientious
objectors
in
the
statutes
that
have
been
enacted
as
time
has
gone
on.
i
think
it’s
wholly
unsupported
contention
to
make.
the
comment
concerning
the
statement
of
purposes
and
the
act
underlines
one
of
the
deficiencies
of
the
district
court's
approach
in
this
case
we
believe
and
he
took
a
very
strict
and
narrow
reading
of
the
purposes.
now,
this
court
has
never
said
that
the
court
is
confined
to
an
explicit
statement
of
purposes
in
considering
the
validity
of
a
statute.
indeed
in
the
moreno
case,
the
food
stamp
case
last
year,
the
court
first
considered
the
explicit
purposes
that
were
stated
and
then
went
on
to
consider
whether
they
were
other
possible
purposes
that
might
have
justified
the
statute.
it's
a
perfectly
proper
and
established
approach.
now,
there
is
one
continuing
misapprehension
that
pervades
the
argument
on
the
other
side
and
that
is
that
there
is
in
the
statute
an
exclusion.
the
statute
is
not
in
terms
to
exclude
anyone,
all
it
does,
is
extend
benefits
to
a
defined
category
of
persons
who
rendered
military
service.
people
who
rendered
alternative
service
are
not
the
only
people
who
denied
benefits;
everyone
else
who
is
not
within
that
category
is
denied
benefits.
someone
who
has
conscientious
objection
to
participation
in
war
and
who
does
not
happen
to
fall
within
the
statutory
exemption,
and
therefore,
he
goes
to
prison
instead
as
mr.
gillette
chose
to
do.
his
life
was
disrupted
by
the
selective
service
laws
but
he
is
finally
not
entitled
to
benefits.
so
it
is
wrong
to
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
the
claim,
but
i
think
it
is
wrong
to
characterize
the
statute
as
carving
out
an
exclusion
of
any
definable
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
definable
group.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
they
say
they
should
be
cover
is
as
well,
that’s
true.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
true
and
i
have
that
in
mind
and
i
think
we
come
back
in
that
case
to
the
--
your
question
that
was
raised
whether
it
would
be
sufficient
if
there
could
be
any
distinction
between
these
two
categories
and
whether
then
it
would
be
permissible
to
grant
a
different
level
of
benefits
to
military
veterans
than
to
alternative
service
selection.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
he
would
have
the
same
and
he
could
argue
that
it
is
irrational
to
cut
it
off
at
179
or
180
days.
any
statute
that
extends
benefits
or
imposes
restrains,
that
draws
line
is
bound
to
create
people
on
the
other
side
of
that
line.
these
are
legislative
decisions,
these
are
policy
judgments
which
we
feel
are
within
congress'
power
to
make.
if
the
claim
being
asserted
is
as
persuasive
and
as
meritorious
as
the
plaintiffs
argue,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
if
it
were
addressed
to
congress
so
that
congress
will
focus
specifically
on
it,
it
would
be
turned
down.
they’re
asking
this
court
to
do
something
that
congress
has
not
explicitly
ever
done
itself.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
as
i
indicated
in
the
hernandez
that
larson
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
have
raised
the
question
whether
under
the
law
he
would
ever
be
entitled
to
as
much
as
$10,000.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
was
yes,
that
was
asserted
below.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it’s
yes,
it’s
contended
in
our
briefs
and
we
say
the
date
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
they
have
relied
on
the
mandamus
statute,
but
they're
seeking
of
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
we
say
yes
that
is
inappropriate,
for
that
offers
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
but
this
is
not
a
case
that
is
within
the
terms
of
that
statute
as
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
it
asked
only
for
declaratory
relief.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right,
and
of
course
that
declaratory
judgment
statute,
this
court
has
said
does
not
grant
jurisdiction
but
really
provides
a
remedy.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
would
be
going
--
i
think
beyond
the
bounds
of
prior
decisions,
it’s
really
in
jurisdictional
amount.
what
they
are
seeking
in
this
case
is
a
claim
to
a
certain
amount
of
money
help.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it’s
less
than
$10,000.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
understand
and
they
are
trying
to
boost
up
the
monitory
value
by
relying
upon
consequential
events
that
may
or
may
not
happen
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
they
vary
depending
upon
the
size
of
the
family.
originally,
in
1966
the
basic
allotment
for
an
individual
who
is
full
time
student
was
a
$130.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
for
up
to
36
months
of
education
and
that
is
since
twice
have
been
increased
in
the
current
base
figure
i
believe
is
$220.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
again,
36
months
of
period.
now,
if
you
have
dependents
--
a
married,
i
don’t
know
if
particularly
goes
by
numbers
or
spouse
but
there
is
a
scale
that
increases
the
benefits
depending
on
the
number
of
dependents.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
the
total.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
something
in
that
order
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
think
that
is
because
our
principle
reliance
is
on
211.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
say
that
does
not
apply
here
either
because
we’re
not
seeking
relief
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
they
did
there
but
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
relief
they’re
seeking
is
not
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus,
we
don’t
believe.
as
mr.
justice
marshall
indicated
that
it’s
traditionally
involved
in
ministerial
duty
involving
a
clear
legal
right
in
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
but
on
the
face
of
the
statute
if
they
have
clearly
no
legal
right,
they
have
to
go
beyond
the
statute
to
make
their
claim.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
not
entirely
sure,
i
think
there
may
be
some
lower
court
decisions
about
ways,
but
i
think
it
is
in
construed
by
some
courts
as
granting
jurisdiction
within
its
rather
narrow
limits
if
it
is
a
case
appropriate
for
that
kind
of
relief.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
our
position.
i
would
just
conclude
with
one
comment
about
the
first
amendment
argument.
we
did
address
the
first
amendment
issues
in
our
brief
in
hernandez.
we
did
not
explicitly
address
them
in
a
reply
brief
in
our
brief
in
robison,
but
they
are
covered
there
and
i
would
say
briefly
that
unlike
the
situation
in
sherbert
against
verner,
where
the
denial
of
employment
compensation
constituted
a
continuing
pressure
upon
the
claimant
to
forgo
or
religious
scruples
and
to
work
on
saturday.
here
there
is
no
such
continuing
pressure.
a
decision
was
made
by
mr.
robison
back
in
1968
to
take
advantage
of
an
exemption
from
military
service
that
congress
had
made
available
and
that
is
the
source
of
his
present
situation
and
there
is
no
continuing
pressure
on
him.
he
claims
--
does
not
claim
that
the
possibility
of
receiving
benefits
exerted
any
pressure
on
him.
in
fact,
if
it
did
exert
pressure
it
wasn’t
very
effective
pressure
because
he
went
ahead
anyway.
thank
you.
