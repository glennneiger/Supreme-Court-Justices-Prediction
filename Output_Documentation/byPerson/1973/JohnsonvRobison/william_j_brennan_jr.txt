mr.

may

ask
you,
do
i
actually
read
judge
geraghty
opinion
is
finally
entering

with
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
it
is
at

covering
your

justice
william
j.

is
it
because
justice
harlan’s
technique
in
welsh,
didn’t
he?
justice
william
j.

but
i
gather
from
what
your
argument
earlier
you
think
the
statute
on
its
face
reflects
a
deliberate
congressional
purpose
to
exclude.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
the
extension
that
justice
harlan
suggested
in
welsh
rested
on
his
feeling
that
the
statute,
we
then
had
before
as
contravened
the
establishment
cause.

what

the
veterans’
readjustment
act
of
1966
provides
educational
assistance
benefits,
but
draft
these
inducted
into
the
armed
forces
and
also
for
conscientious
objectors
also
inducted
into
the
armed
forces
who
served
with
the
troops
on
non-combatant
duty.
the
act
does
not,
however,
provide
educational
assistance
benefits,
but
draft
these
classified
i-o,
that
is
conscientious
objectors
who
perform
required
alternatives
civilian
service,
for
example,
the
two-year
service
performed
by
appellee
in
johnson
v.
robison
at
the
peter
bent
brigham
hospital
in
boston.
because
appellee
was
now
alternative
civilian
service
performer,
the
veterans’
administration
denied
his
application
for
educational
assistance
benefits.
appellee,
thereupon,
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
veterans’
readjustment
act
and
this
action
brought
in
the
district
court
for
massachusetts,
alleging
that
the
provisions,
as
applied
to
deny
him
benefits,
violated
his
first
amendment
guarantees,
the
religious
freedom,
and
his
fifth
amendment
guarantee
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
veterans’
administration
sought
dismissal
of
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
because
38
u.s.c.
section
211
(a)
prohibits
judicial
review
of
decisions
of
the
administrator.
the
district
court
held
that
211
(a)
was
inapplicable
to
have
suit
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
provisions
of
the
act
and
denied
that
motion.
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
held
that
appellee’s
first
amendment
claim
was
without
merit,
but
sustained
appellee’s
equal
protection
claim
and
entered
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
challenged
sections
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
we
agree
that
section
211
(a)
did
not
bar
appellee
suit
and
also
agree
that
appellee’s
first
amendment
claim
is
without
merit.
we
disagree,
however,
that
the
contested
sections
deny
appellee
for
protection
of
the
laws
and
therefore
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
