21
other
lawyers
and
i
am
from
the
state
of
indiana
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
honorable
cale
j.
holder,
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
the
general
question
presented
to
the
court
today
involves
the
correctness
of
the
order
of
judge
holder
prohibiting
william
kunstler
from
representing
a
criminal
defendant
arthur
banks
in
the
case
pending
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
on
december
14,
1972,
banks
an
inmate
of
the
federal
penitentiary
of
terre
haute
was
charged
with
the
assaulting
a
guard
at
the
institution.
thereafter
on
march
21,
kunstler
an
out-of-state
lawyer,
who
was
submitted
to
practice
in
new
york,
filed
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
on
behalf
of
banks.
at
the
request
of
the
government,
a
hearing
was
held
and
judge
holder
denied
the
application
of
kunstler
to
represent
banks.
kunstler
then
filed
the
mandamus
action
against
judge
holder
in
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
order
holder
to
vacate
his
order
and
to
permit
kunstler
to
represent
banks.
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
banks
case
was
denied
by
the
seventh
circuit
by
a
vote
of
four
to
three,
and
then
this
case
came
to
this
court.
judge
holder
denied
kunstler
the
right
to
represent
banks
in
this
case
because
of
numerous
delays
in
the
trial
caused
by
kunstler
and
because
kunstler
after
being
retained
as
counsel
for
banks,
made
statements
to
public
audiences,
and
news
media
in
violation
of
the
rules
of
ethics
of
the
american
bar
association
and
in
violation
of
rule
27
of
the
district
court.
the
following
statements
were
made
by
kunstler
to
public
audiences
and
news
media
while
this
case
was
pending
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
kunstler
said
that
his
client
banks
was
assaulted
by
the
prison
guards,
that
the
charge
against
banks
is
purely
reiterative.
a
cheap
little
way
of
getting
back
at
him
in
being
for
being
a
troublemaker
and
i
am,
if
you
want
to
look
at
our
brief
on
page
6,
i
am
referring
to
the
statements
where
they
are
contained.
kunstler
was
ascertain
that
banks
was
brutalized
by
the
guards.
that
it
was
a
common
cover
up
tactic
in
order
to
protect
the
guards
to
file
charge
against
banks.
that
all
the
evidence
is
inside
the
prison
walls
under
the
control
of
the
authorities
who
brought
the
charges
against
banks.
the
word
of
the
guard
is
always
taken
over
that
of
an
inmate.
that
banks
got
into
all
this
trouble
because
he
does
not
act
like
most
to
the
black
inmates
who
uncle
tom
it
inside,
but
there
is
a
lot
of
antagonism
against
banks
because
his
wife
is
white.
that
attorney
kunstler
urged
students
at
terre
haute
to
organize
demonstrations
and
supported
banks
and
to
fill
of
courtroom
with
sympathetic
spectators
during
the
trial.
that
anything
they
can
do
to
call
attention
to
the
trial
will
be
welcome.
i
am
not
asking
them
to
blow
up
the
courthouse
by
that
certainly
would
draw
attention.
of
course
he
was
quited
as
being
proud
to
be
associated
with
mr.
banks
as
he
represents
the
finest
of
the
pacifists
of
anti
war
movement.
that
mr.
banks
is
a
black
man
who
was
sent
to
jail
for
his
beliefs
in
the
value
of
human
life
and
the
dignity
of
all
the
people
at
a
time
when
many
who
have
much
more
to
defend
choose
alternatives
to
incarceration.
that
mr.
kunstler
sees
this
indictment
as
a
political
attack
by
the
prime,
by
the
prison
administration
on
an
individual
who
firmly
stands
for
his
beliefs,
who
was
articulate
and
spokesman
for
the
black
liberation
of
pacifism,
and
therefore
a
threat
to
the
smooth
running
of
suppression
that
is
so
much
a
part
of
prison
life
in
this
country
today.
that
mr.
kunstler
has
reported
has
saying
“this
case
typifies
the
strategy
used
to
quiet
dissent
among
the
inmates
for
the
case
as
such,
that
due
process
is
virtually
an
impossibility.
the
moment,
he
banks,
went
into
prison
he
was
doomed.
the
only
successful
way
to
defend
yourself
against
charges
such
as
those
against
banks
is
by
creating
a
complete
support
group
around
the
trial
that
includes
demonstrations
and
making
sure
every
court
session
has
a
full
house
and
listing
celebrities
who
are
interested
in
the
case
and
kunstler
had
a
comment
concerning
draft
evaders
in
granting
of
amnesty.”
those
were
the
statements
that
were
made
by
mr.
kunstler
while
this
case
is
pending
for
trial
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
they
where
to
--
some
of
the
statements
were
made
at
the
meeting
at
indiana
state
university
at
terre
haute
where
the
case
was
pending.
some
of
the
statements
were
made
in
there
and
they
are
so
indicated
in
our
brief
at
the
indianapolis
law
school
in
indianapolis
before
the
law
students.
other
statements
were
made
at
press
conferences
held
by
mr.
kunstler
in
indianapolis.
others
were
statements
made
on
the
radio
concerning
this
case
and
the
ones
that
i’ve
gone
over.
now,
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
oh,
yes.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
they
were
made
prior
to
april
1,
1972
when
there
was
a
hearing
before
judge
holder
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
man
should
be
permitted
to
represent
the
defendant.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
august
of
1971,
1972,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
december
14,
1972.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes.
so,
there
are
some
argument
on
the
record,
but
we’ll
stand
on
a
record
as
we
have
recited
it
and
the
defendants
in
this
case,
banks
indicated.
at
the
hearing
under
oath
that
he
had
retained
mr.
kunstler
a
month
before
december
1942,
which
will
be
november
of
1972,
november
1972.
there
are
some
statement
in
the
record
as
to
when
he
actually
filed
in
his
appearance
but
the
evidence
we
believe
will
support
the
idea
that
kunstler
had
been
retained
by
the
defendant
in
november
1972.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
right.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
in
public
before
the
groups
that
i’ve
been
indicated
to
you.
if
all
the
case
was
pending
and
prior
to
the
hearing
on
april
1,
1972
when
all
these
matters
were
brought
out
at
the
hearing
and
did
it
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
think
the
statements
were
made
generally
from
the
first
of
the
year
up
until
the
january
until
april
1972.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
audiences
in
indianapolis
and
in
terre
haute.
after
judge
holder
ruled
against
kunstler
and
while
the
case
was
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit
on
mandamus,
kunstler
made
the
following
statements
at
a
speech
at
indiana
university
law
school
at
indianapolis.
on
a
personal
level,
i
was
deeply
shocked
by
it
because
if
the
pending
case
involving
respondent
banks
was
the
first
time
in
any
federal
case
that
i
have
ever
heard
a
united
states
district
deny
an
attorney
the
right
to
represent
the
person
who
desires
his
services.
it
was
done
in
a
cold
and
in
criminal
manner
by
a
judge
holder,
who
in
doing
so
committed
a
crime.
he
violated
the
civil
rights
of
a
defendant.
under
any
ordinary
set
of
circumstances,
if
a
law
was
just
an
honest
he
should
be
indicted
for
what
he
did.
he
violated
his
oath
of
office.
he
violated
his
oath
as
a
member
of
the
profession
and
he
violated
every
tenant
of
human
decency
of
doing
it.
write
a
letter
to
the
judge,
write
a
letter
to
a
newspaper,
pick
up
the
courthouse
do
anything
that
will
contribute
to
the
issue.
there
is
a
committee
here
for
arthur
banks
and
anyone
that
was
any
information
about
that
can
reach
the
committee
through
the
law
offices
barnhart
nelson.
then
following
that
there
was
a
taped
interview
in
which
mr.
kunstler
made
the
further
remarks
about
judge
holder,
who
was
presiding
judge
at
this
district
where
the
trial
would
be
held
and
has
not
yet
been
held.
the
judge
here,
judge
holder
has
said
that
he
is
not
going
to
permit
me
to
appear
in
his
court
which
means
that
i
can’t
represent
arthur
banks
which
means
that
i
am
disbarred
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
and
he
has
doing
it
for
no
good
reason
whatsoever
other
than
his
own
in
a
prejudice
against
me.
it
would
seem
to
me
any
lawyer
worth
his
or
her
salt
would
be
writing
to
the
editor,
writing
to
the
bar
association,
writing
to
the
judge,
writing
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
seventh
circuit
and
saying
“look
here
we
may
or
we
may
not
agree
with
william
kunstler,
but
that
is
not
the
issue
before
us.
the
issue
is
are
we
going
to
rape
the
constitution
by
allowing
a
federal
judge
to
do
what
the
constitution
says
he
should
never
do
and
that’s
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
an
attorney
of
this
choice.”
i
do
not
think
anyone
should
respect
the
law,
not
certainly
as
it's
practiced
in
america.
if
the
law
is
neither
fair
nor
just
because
it
is
manipulated
and
utilized
and
in
it
is
own
procedures
and
practices
is
unfair
as
well
deal
in
deliberately.
i
think
into
the
system,
i
think
the
best
use
is
to
distrust
it,
strip
it
up
all
of
its
mysticism,
to
demonstrate
to
fill
courtrooms
to
confront
it.
we
would
thinking
nothing
peculiar
at
all
about
picking
congress
or
picking
a
white
house,
why
not
pick
up
to
court?
i
think
that
the
only
answer
in
all
these
systems
is
confrontation,
physical
confrontation.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
were
made
after
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
but
i
believe
that
they
are
relevant
pertinent
in
this
case
because
the
action
of
mandamus
that
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeal
was
the
original
action.
all
of
this
information
that
i’ve
just
read
to
you
including
the
remarks
concerning
judge
holder
where
part
of
the
record.
and
in
addition
to
that
your
honor,
the
findings
of
judge
holder
not
only
found
with
respect
to
what
had
happened,
what
was
happening
but
what
was
going
to
happen
in
the
future
and
kunstler
indicated
the
night
to
give
the
record
reference
to
it,
that
he
intended
to
make
further
statements
in
the
future.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
think
that
was
further
basis
for
his
findings.
i
know
he
has
looked
at
the
crystal
ball,
but
what
had
been
done
would
indicate
to
him
that
a
further
reason
for
him
denying
the
right
to
appear
with
what
he
was
his
going
to
do
in
the
future.
now
after
that
was
done,
banks
then
filed
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
same
case
before
another
the
federal
judge
in
our
district,
judge
dillon
and
this
case
was
still
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
involving
holder
and
dillon.
dillon
denied
the
habeas
corpus
because
he
felt
that
it
had
been
made
of
proper
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
kunstler
then
under
took
to
make
these
further
statement
in
public
about
judge
dillon.
i
think
it
is
a
frightful
thing
that
has
been
done
to
him
by
the
government
of
united
states,
the
american
bar
association
and
the
reason
he
is
complaining
about
that
is
american
bar
association
has
filed
a
amicus
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
21
of
the
so
called
prestigious
indiana
lawyers
who
filed
against
him
and
i
guess
i
am
one
of
those,
a
united
district
judge
by
the
name
of
dillon
who
has
being
sought
to
be
impeached
because
integration
decree
in
indiana
and
while
i
would
oppose
his
impeachment
on
those
grounds,
i
would
whole
heartedly
support
it
for
what
he
his
done
to
the
black
man
in
terre
haute.
he
has
violated
his
oath
of
office
and
he
has
denied
this
man
the
most
fundamental
of
rights.
i
am
reading
from
the
brief,
he
has
ignored
his,
page
9,
he
has
ignored
his
habeas
corpus,
he
has
succeeded
installing
his
case
long
enough
for
the
government
to
catch
up
with
judge
rehnquist
in
washington
and
to
put
his
case
in
limbo
where
he
cannot
move
and
those
who
say
to
american
citizens
trust
in
the
system
and
do
adopt
alternative
methods
may
some
day
remember
this
case
along
with
others
when
people
refused
to
trust
the
system.
it
is
about
the
worst
instance
in
the
career,
in
my
career
of
some
25
years
that
i
have
ever
seen
judge
hoffman
pales
into
insignificance
when
you
compare
him
to
judge
dillon
because
judge
hoffman
was
at
least
honest.
judge
dillon
is
a
fraud
and
i
think
he
has
done
an
enormous
to
justice
to
arthur
banks
and
he
probably
has
done
it
because
he
is
trying
to
avoid
the
anger
of
the
citizens
of
indiana
for
his
integration
decree
and
so
he
is
to
decided
destroy
arthur
banks
in
order
to
get
back
on
the
establishment's
bandwagon.
it
is
a
very
sad
and
desperate
thing
i
think
that
a
federal
judge
would
violate
his
oath
of
office
in
this
fashion
but
i
guess
it
is
not
unexpected
since
president
of
the
united
states
does
it
regularly.
well,
in
this
case
it
is
in
alliance
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
american
bar
association,
and
the
indiana
bar
of
what
they
called
prestigious
man
of
the
indiana
bar
and
the
federal
judges
in
this
district,
judge
holder,
judge
dillon
and
the
others
and
it
is
vicious
cycle,
one
feeds
in
to
the
other.
it
is
a
criminal
conspiracy
to
subvert
the
constitution
and
these
men
like
dillon
and
holder
are
criminals
and
it
is
just
too
bad
that
the
american
people
do
not
recognize
who
the
real
criminals
are
in
their
midst.
they
are
not
in
the
terrible
prison.
now,
admittedly
those
statements
he
made
attacking
our
federal
judges
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana
occurred
after
judge
holder’s
hearing,
but
keep
in
mind
that
this
man,
his
trial
has
not
yet
taken
place
and
one
of
these
days
there
is
going
to
be
a
trial
and
i
think
all
these
matters
should
be
--
were
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
should
be
before
this
court
in
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
kunstler
will
be
able
to
represent
this
man
during
the
trial.
other
reasons
for
denying
of
course
the
right
to
participate
in
this
trial
represent
have
to
do
with
delays.
we’ve
covered
that
in
our
brief
and
i
won’t
bother
you
that
with
that.
but
at
issue
here
today
in
addition,
to
the
correctness
of
judge
holder’s
ruling
is
the
validity
of
rule
27
in
the
canon
of
ethics
of
the
american
bar
association.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that’s
it,
your
honor,
i
think
we’re
all
to
be
treated
the
same
oneness.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
i
would
stand
up
with
my
last
gasp
of
breath
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
i
do
judge
and
let
me
say
the
way
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that
is
right
and
we
have
got
cases
that
support
it.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that
is
--
well
that’s
one
issue
and
then
other
issue
about
these
statements
whether
or
not
they
are
in
the
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment?
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
and
we
think
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
here
we
think
that
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
the
oliver
case.
we
think
that
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
to
chase
v.
robson.
we
think
the
correct
law
is
the
law
that
was
stated
by
this
court
in
sheppard
v.
maxwell
in
which
this
court
said
after
all
the
publicity
that
was
had
in
that
case
is.
there
the
court
says
and
this
is
justice
clark
speaking,
this
court.
“the
courts
must
take
steps
by
rule
and
regulation
that
will
protect
their
processes
from
prejudicial
anxiety
of
interferences.
neither
prosecutors,
counsel
for
defense,
the
accused,
witnesses,
court
staff,
law
enforcement
officers
coming
under
the
jurisdiction
court
should
be
permitted
to
frustrate
its
function.
collaboration
between
counsel
and
press
as
to
information
affecting
the
fairness
a
criminal
trial
is
not
only
subject
to
regulation,
but
it
is
highly
sensible
and
worthy
of
disciplinary
measures.
and
then,
the
court
gets
more
specific
and
says
“more
specifically
the
trial
court
might
well
have
prescribed
extra
judicial
statements
by
any
lawyer,
party
witnesses
or
court
official
which
devotes
prejudicial
manner
such
as
review.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
think
what
the
case
means
to
me
and
you
will
have
to
write
on
it
to
see
what
it
means,
but
i’ll
tell
you
what
it
means
to
me
judge.
it
means
to
me
that
this
court
was
saying
in
that
case
that
the
district
courts
have
got
the
right
to
adopt
a
general
rule
which
will
set
down
the
guidelines
for
the
law
--
for
the
conduct
of
the
lawyer.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
at
a
hearing
judge
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
violated
rule
27.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
no,
just
because
our
rule
does
that?
our
rule
27,
very
specifically
in
our
brief
on
page
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
he
had
a
hearing
judge
and
as
a
result
of
this
hearing
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
right.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
no,
there
were
no
other
orders
issued
with
respect
to
this.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
your
honor
but--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
he
did
not.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
judge,
i
don’t
know.
you’ll
have
to
ask
the
lawyer
i
suppose
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
do
not
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
right.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
do
not
think
the
constitution
has
the
words
of
his
choice
judge.
i
think
the
constitutional
provision
i
have
before
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
alright
maybe
so.
but
all
i
am
saying
is
that
we
have
covered
that
in
our
brief
where
we
say
that
you
are
not
entitled,
you
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
lawyer
of
your
choice.
you
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer
alright,
but
if
the
lawyer
violates
the
canons
of
ethics
as
was
done
in
the
state
v.
kevnon
case,
a
new
jersey
case,
he
maybe
removed
and
that
--
it
had
to
do
with
mr.
avery
bailey
because
of
the
antics
he
had
engaged
in
that
case
and
we’ve
covered
that
in
the
brief.
i
think
my
position
on
that
is
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
decision
and
besides
that
judge,
i
think
we
have
other
cases
that
we’ve
cited
in
here.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
in
this
case?
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
which
i
think
is
wrong.
the
reason
i
think
its
wrong
is
that
it
went
off
mainly
on
the
question
of
waiver.
and
then,
it
also
applied
in
erroneous
test
that
the
statements
that
are
made
have
to
present
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
prejudice
of
a
fair
trial
and
in
administration
of
justice.
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
not
correct
test
at
all.
the
correct
test
was
supplied
in
the
severino
case
and
other
decisions
is
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
likely
and
that
suggests
it
was
contained
in
the
rules
of
the
american
bar
association
with
which
went
to
through
rearden
committee
which
went
to
the
judicial
conference
of
this
court
and
were
approved
by
the
federal
judges
around
united
states.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
the
rules
well,
only
insofar
as
the
judicial
conference
had
approved.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
want
to
make
my
position
clear.
it
is
our
position
here
that
under
on
the
sheppard
case,
this
court
said
after
they
reviewed
all
the
evidence
in
that
case,
“the
courts
must,
they
didn’t
say
should,
must
make
rules
to
cover
the
situation.”
then
they
went
on
to
specify
what
kind
of
rules
they
are
talking
about.
those
that
have
to
do
with
commenting
on
the
merits
of
the
case
it
is
over.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
and
we
made
our
rule
--
it
is
the
same
rule
made
by
federal
district
court
in
the
united
states.
and
it
was
result
of
the
study
by
the
american
bar
association
after
20
minutes
of
the
a
20
--
20
months
of
the
rearden
committee
and
after
a
study
by
the
judicial
conference
of
this
court
and
approval
by
the
judicial
conference
and
this
rule,
i
think
identically
is
enforced
every
district
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
alright,
all
i’m
saying
is
what
were
asking
you
to
do
here
today
is
to
tell
these
federal
district
judges,
what
about
this
rule?
and
as
i
say
and
i
do
not,
i’m
sorry
to
repeat
these
things
started
in
this
court
under
the
sheppard
case.
this
court
said
“you
must
adopt
rules.”
they
did
and
here
is
this
rule
and
as
i
said
it's
substantive
to
say
in
very
federal
district
court
in
united
states,
and
if
it's
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
about
the
--
which
were
or
rather
the
first
amendment,
i
think
this
court
ought
to
say
so.
and
if
it
isn't
violation
of
the
first
amendment
so
that
there
is
some
guidance
that
will
be
given
to
these
federal
judges
throughout
the
united
states
that
are
all
vitally
interested
in
this
question.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
would
absolutely.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
they
would
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
tell
you
that,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
he
has
been
--
he
was
transferred
from
the
terre
haute
prison
to
the
federal
penitentiary
in
sandstone,
minnesota
and
there
while
mr.
kunstler
was
out
there
in
the
wounded
knee
case,
he
made
a
presentation
to
a
federal
judge
and
had
this
--
got
this
man
released
on
bond
on
this
particular
charge
but
that
a
mandamus
action
has
been
filed.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes
and
no
trial
of
course
has
been
held,
but
that
mandamus
action
has
been
filed
by
the
government
before
the
court
of
appeals
out
there
to
contest
the
validity
of
this
district
ruling.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
can;t
give
you
all
the
details
justice
rehnquist
because
i’d
rather
get
it
from
them
but
that
is
my
general
understanding,
that
the
man
is
out
of
there,
as
matter
of
fact
i
think
he
is
here
today.
what
the
details
are
are
on
that,
i
can’t
tell
you,
you
have
to
ask
him.
i’ll
save
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
have
got
five
minutes,
but
i
would
like
to
urge
you
if
i
may
to
pass
on
all
these
questions
that
had
been
raised.
rule
27
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
but
in
this
case
we
do
have
this
rule
27
and
it
has
quite
a
history
to
it
and
as
i
mentioned
before
it
was
set
down
in
the
sheppard
case
that
the
courts
ought
to
adopt
the
rules.
rule
27
is
now
before
this
court
and
mainly
the
court
did
not
permits
mr.
kunstler
to
come
in
because
he
felt
he
had
violated
rule
27.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that
was
part
of
the
finding,
parts
of
his
findings
that
kunstler
had
violated
rule
1f
which
incorporates
the
canons
of
ethics
of
the
american
bar
and
rule
27.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
we
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
dodge
the
issues
in
the
case
to
be
very
frank
and
tried
to
put
the
first
opinion
as
they
did
purely
on
the
matter
of
waiver.
and
when
we
filed
our
petition
for
rehearing
we
raised
these
other
questions
and
then
they
saw
fit
to
find
us
--
to
file
a
supplemental
opinion
in
which
they
spoke
about
it.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
think
not,
but
all
i’m
saying
is
that
we
believe
the
issue
was
in
the
case
and
they
dodged
it
and
i
think,
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case,
and
i
think
the
two
important
constitutional
questions
here
about
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
whether
you're
entitled
to
a
lawyer
of
your
own
choice
by
sixth
amendment
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
are
involved
in
this
case
and
i
would
ho
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
we
disagree
with
court
of
appeals
on
that.
we
think
when
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
that
you’ll
find
that
the
findings
are
supported
by
the
evidence
and
that
the
issues
that
we
talked
about
are
involved.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
think
you’re
going
to
have
to
look
at
the
record
to
see
whether
the
questions
that
we
raised
are
presented
by
the
record.
the
only
other
thing
i
would
like
to
suggest
is
with
respect
to
the
whole
question
here
that
we
are
talking
about
generally
about
the
lawyer
and
what
his
function
is
and
his
obligation
to
me
dealt
with
the
ethical
requirements
of
the
profession.
i
call
your
attention
to
the
--
a
quote
from
frankfurter's
opinion
in
ray
sawyer
when
he
sought
to
sum
up
this
whole
situation
and
said,
“certainly
courts
are
not
and
cannot
be
immune
from
criticism
and
lawyers
of
course
may
indulge
in
criticism.
indeed
they’re
under
special
responsibility
do
exercise
fearlessness
in
doing
so.
but
when
a
lawyer
goes
before
a
public
gathering
and
fiercely
charges
that
the
trial
in
which
is
a
participant
is
unfair
that
the
judge
lacks
integrity,
the
circumstances
under
which
he
speaks
now
only
sharpen
what
he
says
but
he
imports
to
his
attack
inflaming
and
warping
significance.”
he
says
that
the
very
courtroom
in
which
he
walks
to
plead
his
cases
a
travesty.
that
the
procedures
and
reviews
established
to
protect
his
client
from
such
conduct
to
a
sham.
no
matter
how
narrowly
conceive
this
rule
maybe
has
been
betrayed
by
a
lawyer
who
has
engaged
in
kind
of
conduct
here
found
by
the
hawaiian
court.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
no,
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion.
certainly
this
court,
the
supreme
tribunal
charged
with
maintaining
the
rule
of
law
should
be
the
last
place
in
which
these
attacks
on
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
a
judge
and
a
conduct
should
find
constitutional
sanction.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
may
it
please
the
court.
21
other
lawyers
and
i
am
from
the
state
of
indiana
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
honorable
cale
j.
holder,
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
the
general
question
presented
to
the
court
today
involves
the
correctness
of
the
order
of
judge
holder
prohibiting
william
kunstler
from
representing
a
criminal
defendant
arthur
banks
in
the
case
pending
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
on
december
14,
1972,
banks
an
inmate
of
the
federal
penitentiary
of
terre
haute
was
charged
with
the
assaulting
a
guard
at
the
institution.
thereafter
on
march
21,
kunstler
an
out-of-state
lawyer,
who
was
submitted
to
practice
in
new
york,
filed
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
on
behalf
of
banks.
at
the
request
of
the
government,
a
hearing
was
held
and
judge
holder
denied
the
application
of
kunstler
to
represent
banks.
kunstler
then
filed
the
mandamus
action
against
judge
holder
in
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
order
holder
to
vacate
his
order
and
to
permit
kunstler
to
represent
banks.
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
banks
case
was
denied
by
the
seventh
circuit
by
a
vote
of
four
to
three,
and
then
this
case
came
to
this
court.
judge
holder
denied
kunstler
the
right
to
represent
banks
in
this
case
because
of
numerous
delays
in
the
trial
caused
by
kunstler
and
because
kunstler
after
being
retained
as
counsel
for
banks,
made
statements
to
public
audiences,
and
news
media
in
violation
of
the
rules
of
ethics
of
the
american
bar
association
and
in
violation
of
rule
27
of
the
district
court.
the
following
statements
were
made
by
kunstler
to
public
audiences
and
news
media
while
this
case
was
pending
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
kunstler
said
that
his
client
banks
was
assaulted
by
the
prison
guards,
that
the
charge
against
banks
is
purely
reiterative.
a
cheap
little
way
of
getting
back
at
him
in
being
for
being
a
troublemaker
and
i
am,
if
you
want
to
look
at
our
brief
on
page
6,
i
am
referring
to
the
statements
where
they
are
contained.
kunstler
was
ascertain
that
banks
was
brutalized
by
the
guards.
that
it
was
a
common
cover
up
tactic
in
order
to
protect
the
guards
to
file
charge
against
banks.
that
all
the
evidence
is
inside
the
prison
walls
under
the
control
of
the
authorities
who
brought
the
charges
against
banks.
the
word
of
the
guard
is
always
taken
over
that
of
an
inmate.
that
banks
got
into
all
this
trouble
because
he
does
not
act
like
most
to
the
black
inmates
who
uncle
tom
it
inside,
but
there
is
a
lot
of
antagonism
against
banks
because
his
wife
is
white.
that
attorney
kunstler
urged
students
at
terre
haute
to
organize
demonstrations
and
supported
banks
and
to
fill
of
courtroom
with
sympathetic
spectators
during
the
trial.
that
anything
they
can
do
to
call
attention
to
the
trial
will
be
welcome.
i
am
not
asking
them
to
blow
up
the
courthouse
by
that
certainly
would
draw
attention.
of
course
he
was
quited
as
being
proud
to
be
associated
with
mr.
banks
as
he
represents
the
finest
of
the
pacifists
of
anti
war
movement.
that
mr.
banks
is
a
black
man
who
was
sent
to
jail
for
his
beliefs
in
the
value
of
human
life
and
the
dignity
of
all
the
people
at
a
time
when
many
who
have
much
more
to
defend
choose
alternatives
to
incarceration.
that
mr.
kunstler
sees
this
indictment
as
a
political
attack
by
the
prime,
by
the
prison
administration
on
an
individual
who
firmly
stands
for
his
beliefs,
who
was
articulate
and
spokesman
for
the
black
liberation
of
pacifism,
and
therefore
a
threat
to
the
smooth
running
of
suppression
that
is
so
much
a
part
of
prison
life
in
this
country
today.
that
mr.
kunstler
has
reported
has
saying
“this
case
typifies
the
strategy
used
to
quiet
dissent
among
the
inmates
for
the
case
as
such,
that
due
process
is
virtually
an
impossibility.
the
moment,
he
banks,
went
into
prison
he
was
doomed.
the
only
successful
way
to
defend
yourself
against
charges
such
as
those
against
banks
is
by
creating
a
complete
support
group
around
the
trial
that
includes
demonstrations
and
making
sure
every
court
session
has
a
full
house
and
listing
celebrities
who
are
interested
in
the
case
and
kunstler
had
a
comment
concerning
draft
evaders
in
granting
of
amnesty.”
those
were
the
statements
that
were
made
by
mr.
kunstler
while
this
case
is
pending
for
trial
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
they
where
to
--
some
of
the
statements
were
made
at
the
meeting
at
indiana
state
university
at
terre
haute
where
the
case
was
pending.
some
of
the
statements
were
made
in
there
and
they
are
so
indicated
in
our
brief
at
the
indianapolis
law
school
in
indianapolis
before
the
law
students.
other
statements
were
made
at
press
conferences
held
by
mr.
kunstler
in
indianapolis.
others
were
statements
made
on
the
radio
concerning
this
case
and
the
ones
that
i’ve
gone
over.
now,
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
oh,
yes.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
they
were
made
prior
to
april
1,
1972
when
there
was
a
hearing
before
judge
holder
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
man
should
be
permitted
to
represent
the
defendant.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
august
of
1971,
1972,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
december
14,
1972.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes.
so,
there
are
some
argument
on
the
record,
but
we’ll
stand
on
a
record
as
we
have
recited
it
and
the
defendants
in
this
case,
banks
indicated.
at
the
hearing
under
oath
that
he
had
retained
mr.
kunstler
a
month
before
december
1942,
which
will
be
november
of
1972,
november
1972.
there
are
some
statement
in
the
record
as
to
when
he
actually
filed
in
his
appearance
but
the
evidence
we
believe
will
support
the
idea
that
kunstler
had
been
retained
by
the
defendant
in
november
1972.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
right.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
in
public
before
the
groups
that
i’ve
been
indicated
to
you.
if
all
the
case
was
pending
and
prior
to
the
hearing
on
april
1,
1972
when
all
these
matters
were
brought
out
at
the
hearing
and
did
it
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
think
the
statements
were
made
generally
from
the
first
of
the
year
up
until
the
january
until
april
1972.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
audiences
in
indianapolis
and
in
terre
haute.
after
judge
holder
ruled
against
kunstler
and
while
the
case
was
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit
on
mandamus,
kunstler
made
the
following
statements
at
a
speech
at
indiana
university
law
school
at
indianapolis.
on
a
personal
level,
i
was
deeply
shocked
by
it
because
if
the
pending
case
involving
respondent
banks
was
the
first
time
in
any
federal
case
that
i
have
ever
heard
a
united
states
district
deny
an
attorney
the
right
to
represent
the
person
who
desires
his
services.
it
was
done
in
a
cold
and
in
criminal
manner
by
a
judge
holder,
who
in
doing
so
committed
a
crime.
he
violated
the
civil
rights
of
a
defendant.
under
any
ordinary
set
of
circumstances,
if
a
law
was
just
an
honest
he
should
be
indicted
for
what
he
did.
he
violated
his
oath
of
office.
he
violated
his
oath
as
a
member
of
the
profession
and
he
violated
every
tenant
of
human
decency
of
doing
it.
write
a
letter
to
the
judge,
write
a
letter
to
a
newspaper,
pick
up
the
courthouse
do
anything
that
will
contribute
to
the
issue.
there
is
a
committee
here
for
arthur
banks
and
anyone
that
was
any
information
about
that
can
reach
the
committee
through
the
law
offices
barnhart
nelson.
then
following
that
there
was
a
taped
interview
in
which
mr.
kunstler
made
the
further
remarks
about
judge
holder,
who
was
presiding
judge
at
this
district
where
the
trial
would
be
held
and
has
not
yet
been
held.
the
judge
here,
judge
holder
has
said
that
he
is
not
going
to
permit
me
to
appear
in
his
court
which
means
that
i
can’t
represent
arthur
banks
which
means
that
i
am
disbarred
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
and
he
has
doing
it
for
no
good
reason
whatsoever
other
than
his
own
in
a
prejudice
against
me.
it
would
seem
to
me
any
lawyer
worth
his
or
her
salt
would
be
writing
to
the
editor,
writing
to
the
bar
association,
writing
to
the
judge,
writing
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
seventh
circuit
and
saying
“look
here
we
may
or
we
may
not
agree
with
william
kunstler,
but
that
is
not
the
issue
before
us.
the
issue
is
are
we
going
to
rape
the
constitution
by
allowing
a
federal
judge
to
do
what
the
constitution
says
he
should
never
do
and
that’s
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
an
attorney
of
this
choice.”
i
do
not
think
anyone
should
respect
the
law,
not
certainly
as
it's
practiced
in
america.
if
the
law
is
neither
fair
nor
just
because
it
is
manipulated
and
utilized
and
in
it
is
own
procedures
and
practices
is
unfair
as
well
deal
in
deliberately.
i
think
into
the
system,
i
think
the
best
use
is
to
distrust
it,
strip
it
up
all
of
its
mysticism,
to
demonstrate
to
fill
courtrooms
to
confront
it.
we
would
thinking
nothing
peculiar
at
all
about
picking
congress
or
picking
a
white
house,
why
not
pick
up
to
court?
i
think
that
the
only
answer
in
all
these
systems
is
confrontation,
physical
confrontation.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
were
made
after
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
but
i
believe
that
they
are
relevant
pertinent
in
this
case
because
the
action
of
mandamus
that
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeal
was
the
original
action.
all
of
this
information
that
i’ve
just
read
to
you
including
the
remarks
concerning
judge
holder
where
part
of
the
record.
and
in
addition
to
that
your
honor,
the
findings
of
judge
holder
not
only
found
with
respect
to
what
had
happened,
what
was
happening
but
what
was
going
to
happen
in
the
future
and
kunstler
indicated
the
night
to
give
the
record
reference
to
it,
that
he
intended
to
make
further
statements
in
the
future.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
think
that
was
further
basis
for
his
findings.
i
know
he
has
looked
at
the
crystal
ball,
but
what
had
been
done
would
indicate
to
him
that
a
further
reason
for
him
denying
the
right
to
appear
with
what
he
was
his
going
to
do
in
the
future.
now
after
that
was
done,
banks
then
filed
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
same
case
before
another
the
federal
judge
in
our
district,
judge
dillon
and
this
case
was
still
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
involving
holder
and
dillon.
dillon
denied
the
habeas
corpus
because
he
felt
that
it
had
been
made
of
proper
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
kunstler
then
under
took
to
make
these
further
statement
in
public
about
judge
dillon.
i
think
it
is
a
frightful
thing
that
has
been
done
to
him
by
the
government
of
united
states,
the
american
bar
association
and
the
reason
he
is
complaining
about
that
is
american
bar
association
has
filed
a
amicus
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
21
of
the
so
called
prestigious
indiana
lawyers
who
filed
against
him
and
i
guess
i
am
one
of
those,
a
united
district
judge
by
the
name
of
dillon
who
has
being
sought
to
be
impeached
because
integration
decree
in
indiana
and
while
i
would
oppose
his
impeachment
on
those
grounds,
i
would
whole
heartedly
support
it
for
what
he
his
done
to
the
black
man
in
terre
haute.
he
has
violated
his
oath
of
office
and
he
has
denied
this
man
the
most
fundamental
of
rights.
i
am
reading
from
the
brief,
he
has
ignored
his,
page
9,
he
has
ignored
his
habeas
corpus,
he
has
succeeded
installing
his
case
long
enough
for
the
government
to
catch
up
with
judge
rehnquist
in
washington
and
to
put
his
case
in
limbo
where
he
cannot
move
and
those
who
say
to
american
citizens
trust
in
the
system
and
do
adopt
alternative
methods
may
some
day
remember
this
case
along
with
others
when
people
refused
to
trust
the
system.
it
is
about
the
worst
instance
in
the
career,
in
my
career
of
some
25
years
that
i
have
ever
seen
judge
hoffman
pales
into
insignificance
when
you
compare
him
to
judge
dillon
because
judge
hoffman
was
at
least
honest.
judge
dillon
is
a
fraud
and
i
think
he
has
done
an
enormous
to
justice
to
arthur
banks
and
he
probably
has
done
it
because
he
is
trying
to
avoid
the
anger
of
the
citizens
of
indiana
for
his
integration
decree
and
so
he
is
to
decided
destroy
arthur
banks
in
order
to
get
back
on
the
establishment's
bandwagon.
it
is
a
very
sad
and
desperate
thing
i
think
that
a
federal
judge
would
violate
his
oath
of
office
in
this
fashion
but
i
guess
it
is
not
unexpected
since
president
of
the
united
states
does
it
regularly.
well,
in
this
case
it
is
in
alliance
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
american
bar
association,
and
the
indiana
bar
of
what
they
called
prestigious
man
of
the
indiana
bar
and
the
federal
judges
in
this
district,
judge
holder,
judge
dillon
and
the
others
and
it
is
vicious
cycle,
one
feeds
in
to
the
other.
it
is
a
criminal
conspiracy
to
subvert
the
constitution
and
these
men
like
dillon
and
holder
are
criminals
and
it
is
just
too
bad
that
the
american
people
do
not
recognize
who
the
real
criminals
are
in
their
midst.
they
are
not
in
the
terrible
prison.
now,
admittedly
those
statements
he
made
attacking
our
federal
judges
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana
occurred
after
judge
holder’s
hearing,
but
keep
in
mind
that
this
man,
his
trial
has
not
yet
taken
place
and
one
of
these
days
there
is
going
to
be
a
trial
and
i
think
all
these
matters
should
be
--
were
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
should
be
before
this
court
in
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
kunstler
will
be
able
to
represent
this
man
during
the
trial.
other
reasons
for
denying
of
course
the
right
to
participate
in
this
trial
represent
have
to
do
with
delays.
we’ve
covered
that
in
our
brief
and
i
won’t
bother
you
that
with
that.
but
at
issue
here
today
in
addition,
to
the
correctness
of
judge
holder’s
ruling
is
the
validity
of
rule
27
in
the
canon
of
ethics
of
the
american
bar
association.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that’s
it,
your
honor,
i
think
we’re
all
to
be
treated
the
same
oneness.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
i
would
stand
up
with
my
last
gasp
of
breath
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
i
do
judge
and
let
me
say
the
way
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that
is
right
and
we
have
got
cases
that
support
it.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that
is
--
well
that’s
one
issue
and
then
other
issue
about
these
statements
whether
or
not
they
are
in
the
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment?
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
and
we
think
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
here
we
think
that
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
the
oliver
case.
we
think
that
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
to
chase
v.
robson.
we
think
the
correct
law
is
the
law
that
was
stated
by
this
court
in
sheppard
v.
maxwell
in
which
this
court
said
after
all
the
publicity
that
was
had
in
that
case
is.
there
the
court
says
and
this
is
justice
clark
speaking,
this
court.
“the
courts
must
take
steps
by
rule
and
regulation
that
will
protect
their
processes
from
prejudicial
anxiety
of
interferences.
neither
prosecutors,
counsel
for
defense,
the
accused,
witnesses,
court
staff,
law
enforcement
officers
coming
under
the
jurisdiction
court
should
be
permitted
to
frustrate
its
function.
collaboration
between
counsel
and
press
as
to
information
affecting
the
fairness
a
criminal
trial
is
not
only
subject
to
regulation,
but
it
is
highly
sensible
and
worthy
of
disciplinary
measures.
and
then,
the
court
gets
more
specific
and
says
“more
specifically
the
trial
court
might
well
have
prescribed
extra
judicial
statements
by
any
lawyer,
party
witnesses
or
court
official
which
devotes
prejudicial
manner
such
as
review.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
think
what
the
case
means
to
me
and
you
will
have
to
write
on
it
to
see
what
it
means,
but
i’ll
tell
you
what
it
means
to
me
judge.
it
means
to
me
that
this
court
was
saying
in
that
case
that
the
district
courts
have
got
the
right
to
adopt
a
general
rule
which
will
set
down
the
guidelines
for
the
law
--
for
the
conduct
of
the
lawyer.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
at
a
hearing
judge
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
violated
rule
27.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
no,
just
because
our
rule
does
that?
our
rule
27,
very
specifically
in
our
brief
on
page
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
he
had
a
hearing
judge
and
as
a
result
of
this
hearing
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
right.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
no,
there
were
no
other
orders
issued
with
respect
to
this.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes,
your
honor
but--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
he
did
not.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
judge,
i
don’t
know.
you’ll
have
to
ask
the
lawyer
i
suppose
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
do
not
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
right.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
do
not
think
the
constitution
has
the
words
of
his
choice
judge.
i
think
the
constitutional
provision
i
have
before
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
alright
maybe
so.
but
all
i
am
saying
is
that
we
have
covered
that
in
our
brief
where
we
say
that
you
are
not
entitled,
you
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
lawyer
of
your
choice.
you
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer
alright,
but
if
the
lawyer
violates
the
canons
of
ethics
as
was
done
in
the
state
v.
kevnon
case,
a
new
jersey
case,
he
maybe
removed
and
that
--
it
had
to
do
with
mr.
avery
bailey
because
of
the
antics
he
had
engaged
in
that
case
and
we’ve
covered
that
in
the
brief.
i
think
my
position
on
that
is
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
think
it
is
a
very
good
decision
and
besides
that
judge,
i
think
we
have
other
cases
that
we’ve
cited
in
here.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
in
this
case?
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
which
i
think
is
wrong.
the
reason
i
think
its
wrong
is
that
it
went
off
mainly
on
the
question
of
waiver.
and
then,
it
also
applied
in
erroneous
test
that
the
statements
that
are
made
have
to
present
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
prejudice
of
a
fair
trial
and
in
administration
of
justice.
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
not
correct
test
at
all.
the
correct
test
was
supplied
in
the
severino
case
and
other
decisions
is
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
likely
and
that
suggests
it
was
contained
in
the
rules
of
the
american
bar
association
with
which
went
to
through
rearden
committee
which
went
to
the
judicial
conference
of
this
court
and
were
approved
by
the
federal
judges
around
united
states.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
the
rules
well,
only
insofar
as
the
judicial
conference
had
approved.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
want
to
make
my
position
clear.
it
is
our
position
here
that
under
on
the
sheppard
case,
this
court
said
after
they
reviewed
all
the
evidence
in
that
case,
“the
courts
must,
they
didn’t
say
should,
must
make
rules
to
cover
the
situation.”
then
they
went
on
to
specify
what
kind
of
rules
they
are
talking
about.
those
that
have
to
do
with
commenting
on
the
merits
of
the
case
it
is
over.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
and
we
made
our
rule
--
it
is
the
same
rule
made
by
federal
district
court
in
the
united
states.
and
it
was
result
of
the
study
by
the
american
bar
association
after
20
minutes
of
the
a
20
--
20
months
of
the
rearden
committee
and
after
a
study
by
the
judicial
conference
of
this
court
and
approval
by
the
judicial
conference
and
this
rule,
i
think
identically
is
enforced
every
district
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
alright,
all
i’m
saying
is
what
were
asking
you
to
do
here
today
is
to
tell
these
federal
district
judges,
what
about
this
rule?
and
as
i
say
and
i
do
not,
i’m
sorry
to
repeat
these
things
started
in
this
court
under
the
sheppard
case.
this
court
said
“you
must
adopt
rules.”
they
did
and
here
is
this
rule
and
as
i
said
it's
substantive
to
say
in
very
federal
district
court
in
united
states,
and
if
it's
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
about
the
--
which
were
or
rather
the
first
amendment,
i
think
this
court
ought
to
say
so.
and
if
it
isn't
violation
of
the
first
amendment
so
that
there
is
some
guidance
that
will
be
given
to
these
federal
judges
throughout
the
united
states
that
are
all
vitally
interested
in
this
question.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
would
absolutely.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
they
would
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
tell
you
that,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
he
has
been
--
he
was
transferred
from
the
terre
haute
prison
to
the
federal
penitentiary
in
sandstone,
minnesota
and
there
while
mr.
kunstler
was
out
there
in
the
wounded
knee
case,
he
made
a
presentation
to
a
federal
judge
and
had
this
--
got
this
man
released
on
bond
on
this
particular
charge
but
that
a
mandamus
action
has
been
filed.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
yes
and
no
trial
of
course
has
been
held,
but
that
mandamus
action
has
been
filed
by
the
government
before
the
court
of
appeals
out
there
to
contest
the
validity
of
this
district
ruling.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
can;t
give
you
all
the
details
justice
rehnquist
because
i’d
rather
get
it
from
them
but
that
is
my
general
understanding,
that
the
man
is
out
of
there,
as
matter
of
fact
i
think
he
is
here
today.
what
the
details
are
are
on
that,
i
can’t
tell
you,
you
have
to
ask
him.
i’ll
save
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
have
got
five
minutes,
but
i
would
like
to
urge
you
if
i
may
to
pass
on
all
these
questions
that
had
been
raised.
rule
27
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
but
in
this
case
we
do
have
this
rule
27
and
it
has
quite
a
history
to
it
and
as
i
mentioned
before
it
was
set
down
in
the
sheppard
case
that
the
courts
ought
to
adopt
the
rules.
rule
27
is
now
before
this
court
and
mainly
the
court
did
not
permits
mr.
kunstler
to
come
in
because
he
felt
he
had
violated
rule
27.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
that
was
part
of
the
finding,
parts
of
his
findings
that
kunstler
had
violated
rule
1f
which
incorporates
the
canons
of
ethics
of
the
american
bar
and
rule
27.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
we
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
dodge
the
issues
in
the
case
to
be
very
frank
and
tried
to
put
the
first
opinion
as
they
did
purely
on
the
matter
of
waiver.
and
when
we
filed
our
petition
for
rehearing
we
raised
these
other
questions
and
then
they
saw
fit
to
find
us
--
to
file
a
supplemental
opinion
in
which
they
spoke
about
it.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
i
think
not,
but
all
i’m
saying
is
that
we
believe
the
issue
was
in
the
case
and
they
dodged
it
and
i
think,
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case,
and
i
think
the
two
important
constitutional
questions
here
about
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
whether
you're
entitled
to
a
lawyer
of
your
own
choice
by
sixth
amendment
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
are
involved
in
this
case
and
i
would
ho
--
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
well,
we
disagree
with
court
of
appeals
on
that.
we
think
when
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
that
you’ll
find
that
the
findings
are
supported
by
the
evidence
and
that
the
issues
that
we
talked
about
are
involved.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
i
think
you’re
going
to
have
to
look
at
the
record
to
see
whether
the
questions
that
we
raised
are
presented
by
the
record.
the
only
other
thing
i
would
like
to
suggest
is
with
respect
to
the
whole
question
here
that
we
are
talking
about
generally
about
the
lawyer
and
what
his
function
is
and
his
obligation
to
me
dealt
with
the
ethical
requirements
of
the
profession.
i
call
your
attention
to
the
--
a
quote
from
frankfurter's
opinion
in
ray
sawyer
when
he
sought
to
sum
up
this
whole
situation
and
said,
“certainly
courts
are
not
and
cannot
be
immune
from
criticism
and
lawyers
of
course
may
indulge
in
criticism.
indeed
they’re
under
special
responsibility
do
exercise
fearlessness
in
doing
so.
but
when
a
lawyer
goes
before
a
public
gathering
and
fiercely
charges
that
the
trial
in
which
is
a
participant
is
unfair
that
the
judge
lacks
integrity,
the
circumstances
under
which
he
speaks
now
only
sharpen
what
he
says
but
he
imports
to
his
attack
inflaming
and
warping
significance.”
he
says
that
the
very
courtroom
in
which
he
walks
to
plead
his
cases
a
travesty.
that
the
procedures
and
reviews
established
to
protect
his
client
from
such
conduct
to
a
sham.
no
matter
how
narrowly
conceive
this
rule
maybe
has
been
betrayed
by
a
lawyer
who
has
engaged
in
kind
of
conduct
here
found
by
the
hawaiian
court.
mr.
karl
j.
stipher
no,
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion.
certainly
this
court,
the
supreme
tribunal
charged
with
maintaining
the
rule
of
law
should
be
the
last
place
in
which
these
attacks
on
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
a
judge
and
a
conduct
should
find
constitutional
sanction.
