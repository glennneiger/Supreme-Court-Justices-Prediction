now,
is
it
your
position
that
or
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
judge
had
refused
to
permit
a
member
of
the
indiana
bar
to
represent
mr.
banks?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
as
a
matter
of
--
just
as
a
matter
of
however
a
district
judge
has
a
power
to
eject
from
his
courtroom
an
attorney
who
violates
the
canon
of
ethics
over
the
objection
of
his
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
was
conditioned
upon
the
counsel
of
his
choice
complying
with
the
canons
of
ethics
justice
byron
r.
white
that
case
is
not
the
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
answered
that
question
the
other
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
so
but
it
didn’t
in
--
that
case
didn’t
suggest
that
if
a
lawyer
violated
an
order
against
making
statements
about
a
case,
that
the
lawyer
could
be
disqualified
from
representing
the
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
issue
here
is
at
stake?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
we're
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wondered
you
think
we
have
a
--
if
it's
the
factual
question
then
we're
just
going
to
be
reassessing
the
court
of
appeals
that
might
be
one
matter,
but
if
we
have
an
issue
of
law
here
with
some
kind,
that
might
be
another
--
do
you
think
there's
an
issue
of
law
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this,
is
there
any
--
is
there
a
contention
in
the
case
that
a
judge
must
permit
a
lawyer
to
continue
to
represent
a
client
if
the
lawyer
stood
up
in
open
court
and
said
i
know
the
rules
of
the
court,
i
can
see
their
validity,
but
i
have
no
intention
of
following
them.
is
that
an
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
despite
the
sixth
amendment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
my
question,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
gets
up
or
the
attorney
gets
up
and
says
you
told
me
to
do
something
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
here.
i
know
the
rule
of
court,
i’m
not
going
to
obey
it.
would
the
sixth
amendment
require
the
court
to
permit
him
to
continue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
could
be
circumstances
that
were,
i
suppose
were
--
would
override
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
have
to.
on
that
approach
the
rules
of
court
aren't
implicated
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
mandamus
properly
was
granted?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
i
think
it
the
judge
or
the
petitioner
here
would
be
entitled
to
support
his
order
and
to
defend
the
mandamus
here
now,
on
any
ground
that
would
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
you
in
the
before
seventh
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what
was
presented
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
other
issue,
did
he
put
in
the
interest
of
the
government
interfere
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
said,
it’s
too
late?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
we
do
have
here
the
before
us
the
issue,
a
little
broader
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
they
actually
entertained
and
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
then
we
--
the
validity
of
that
standard
and
the
factual
underpinnings
for
--
at
least
are
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
stavis
is
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
--
in
the
court
below
in
a
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
record
there
is
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
--
i
don’t
see
that
the
court
of
appeal
has
said
or
even
held
that
it
is
proper
improper
to
disqualify
attorney
for
violating
rule
27?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
a
reason
given
by
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
doesn’t
seem
to
be
the
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
was
presented
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
still
didn’t
face
up
the
issue
you
--
that
you
say
you
are
really
representing?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
we
--
i
suppose
to
--
we
must
disagree
with
them
on
this
record
than
to
reverse?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
it
your
position
that
or
would
your
position
be
the

if
the
