mr.
stavis,
just
submission
that
rule
27
is
not
operative
without
this
advanced
finding
in

justice
william
j.

excuse
me
mr.
stavis,
does
the
record
show
anything
of
the
practice
either
in
judge
holder’s
court
or
generally
in
that
district
court
of
admission
to
the
attorney’s
pro
hac
vice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
that
the
footnote,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
getting
back
to
justice
white’s
original
question
what's
before
us?
now,
what’s
before
us
is
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
granting
mandamus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
i
read
this
correctly
and
i
have
not
read
the
application
for
the
writ,
the
only
question
submitted
was
alleged
prejudicial
publicity
as
the
basis
upon
which
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
rested
and
that
ought
to
suffice.
and
if
i
read
the
short
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
says
that
in
some
way
we
believe
that
defendant
banks
has
waived
any
right
to
object
to
attorney
kunstler’s
pre
trial
publicity
as
denying
him
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
and
an
impartial
of
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
accordingly
the
mandamus
is
granted.
well,
that
is
rather
now
issue
that
would
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

doesn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
to
get
into
all
these
far
reaching
questions
that
appearing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily
by
the
time
the
case
gets
here,
it
maybe
that
the
loser
below
can
defend
it
here
on
other
grounds,
the
order
before
us
to
review.
but
we
don’t
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
original
order
and
apply
that
principle.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
he
--
was
the
issue
ever
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
judge
holder
was
entitled
to
disqualify
this
attorney
for
violation
of
outstanding
court
rules?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
suggest
they
have
some
truthfully
(inaudible)
i’m
looking
at
page
46,
in
the
last
paragraph
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
said,
in
considering
the
broader
issue
we
conclude
that
before
a
trial
court
may
properly
limit
defendant's
right
to
a
chosen
counsel,
there
must
be
sufficiently
supported
and
specific
findings
of
fact
that
the
conduct
of
the
defendant’s
attorney
creates
a
serious
and
eminent
threat
of
“significant
prejudice
to
the
defendant
himself”
which
was
the
precisely
the
issue
considered
in
the
original
opinion
or
of
both
disruption
of
the
orderly
processes
of
justice
and
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case.
so,
if
they
treated
with
another
issue
besides
that
of
prejudice
the
defendant
himself
that
was
limited
for
the
second
disruption
of
the
orderly
process.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

in

the
bailey
decision
of
the
jersey
supreme
court
maybe
right.

lawyers
come

all

for
the

so
forth.
our

of
the

reveals
that
the

did
not
include
this
broader

its

the
