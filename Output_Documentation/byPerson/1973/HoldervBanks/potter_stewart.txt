there
they
are
all
made
in
public,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
before
the
charge
was
brought?
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
statements,
these
various
statements,
remained
you
say
they
are
all
made
in
public?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
so
they
are
--
and
when
was
the
earliest
statement
they
ever
made?
i’m
just
trying
to
get
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
due
to
indiana
audiences?
justice
potter
stewart
now
by
the
content
of
those
statements
you
just
read,
they
apparently
were
made
after
mr.
kunstler
was
denied
the
right
appear
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
couldn’t
been
the
reason
for
the
denial?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
stipher
in
response
to
a
question
from
my
brother
white
i
understood
you
to
say
that
is
wholly
insignificant
and
irrelevant
in
this
case
that
mr.
kunstler
was
an
out-of-state
lawyer,
you’d
be
making
precisely
the
same
argument,
just
as
strong
if
you
were
in
indiana
--
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
issue
without
going
into
detail?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
issue
has
not
in
a
deal
with
mr.
kunstler
representation
there,
hasn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
different
districts,
judicial
districts?
justice
potter
stewart
different
divisions
of
the
same
district?
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
not
talking
about
exhibit
a
on

1a
of
your
appendix
to
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
exhibit
b
was
published
where?
justice

stewart
it's
alright.

stewart
where
was

stewart
there
is
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
they
get
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
further
there
was
a
rule
27,
is
that
number
of
the
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
were
told
earlier
by
counsel
that
that
rule
has
a
counterpart
in
every
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
contrary
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
presumably
a
lawyer
whose
even
if
he
hadn’t
practice
before
in
this
district
court
would
know
about
that
rule,
wouldn’t
he?
justice

stewart
you
referred

i
think
i
understood
to

that
you
referred

about

case

that’s
in

somewhere
i
think?

find
it
out,

think
about
