mr.
morton
stavis
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
morton
stavis
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
answer
i’d
like
to
settle
a
few
of
the
questions
that
arose
in
the
course
of
my
adversary’s
argument.
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justices
rehnquist
and
brennan,
banks
is
here,
seated
in
front
row.
he
was
released
on
bail
by
united
states
district
court
in
minnesota
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
we
start
with
questions
as
to
incarceration
based
upon
his
prior
conviction
as
well
as
certain
questions
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
his
present
indictment.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right,
sir.
that
mr.
kunstler
was
his
attorney
in
that
matter
and
in
view
of
the
fact
the
government
of
united
states
brought
a
habeas,
brought
a
mandamus
before
the
eighth
circuit.
judge
lord
in
that
case,
questioned
mr.
kunstler
to
represent
him
as
a
respondent
from
the
mandamus
proceeding.
mr.
kunstler
is
now
representing
judge
lord
before
the
eight
circuit
and
an
order
has
been
handed
down
by
the
eight
circuit
on
the
date
of
april
19,
1974,
requiring
filing
of
briefs
and
setting
a
hearing
there
on
june
10,
1974
at
which
you
will
get
--
at
which
mr.
kunstler
expects
to
represent
judge
lord.
mr.
morton
stavis
the
issue
was
among
other
things
with
respect
to
the
prior
incarcerations,
mr.
banks
had
been
kept
in
solitary
confinement
for
approximately
18
months.
mr.
morton
stavis
none
whatsoever.
furthermore
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
don’t
believe
--
i
don’t
believe
they
do
accepting
with
respect
to
one
question.
it
was
also
as
to
which
my
adversary
indicated
they
didn’t
know
the
answer
and
that
is
that
mr.
kunstler
indubitably
represents
mr.
banks.
i
spoke
to
mr.
banks
during
the
luncheon
recess,
but
i
didn’t
really
have
to.
he
has
said
that
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
he
intends
to
do
is
to
alter
his
relationship
with
mr.
kunstler
the
man
to
whom
he
now
owes
his
freedom.
i’d
like
now
to
turn
to
some
of
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
and
some
of
the
rather
confusing
answers
that
i
thought
have
been
given
in
response
to
those
questions.
mr.
kunstler
was
not
retained
until
february
9,
1973.
that
was
the
first
time
that
was
mr.
kunstler
ever
meet
mr.
banks
and
whatever
the
record
may
show
as
to
prior
statements
by
mr.
banks
that
he
had
retained
mr.
bloomberg
to
whom
he
paid
a
fee
and
also
mr.
kunstler
in
some
secondary
capacity
to
mr.
bloomberg.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
first
time
mr.
kunstler
met
mr.
banks
and
accepted
to
retain,
it
was
on
february
9.
secondly,
there
was
not
a
continuous
range
of
statements
from
january
1st
up
until
april
1,
1973.
all
of
the
statements
which
appeared
in
the
record,
all
of
them
are
attached
to
our
brief
and
they
consist
of
the
following.
number
one,
an
interview
sought
out
by
a
newspaper
reporter
in
indianapolis,
indiana
had
a
cocktail
party
which
mr.
kunstler
attended,
the
result
of
which
was
an
item
appearing
in
the
indianapolis
star
on
february
10
on
page
31.
there
was
not
a
shred
of
proof
that
that
newspaper
was
distributed
in
terre
haute,
indiana,
95
miles
away
and
moreover
and
we
think
it's
of
particular
important,
terre
haute
has
separate
jury
rules
from
the
indianapolis.
secondly
--
mr.
morton
stavis
different
divisions
within
districts
—
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right
and
separate
jury
laws
and
we
refer
to
that
if
we
cited
enough
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that’s
right.
that’s
the
statement.
that’s
the
interview
at
the
cocktail
party.
the
second
item
is
a
press
release
issued
at
the
organization
in
new
york
on
the
same
day,
february
9
with
no
proof
whatsoever
that
it
ever
got
anywhere
near
terre
haute,
indiana.
the
third
item
is
a
one
minute
statement
by
a
tv
reporter,
who
does
not
report
accurately
to
call
mr.
kunstler
and
which
refers
to
a
speech
that
mr.
kunstler
made
again
on
february
9.
the
last
item
was
an
item
which
appears
on
time
magazine
on
the
date
of
february
26,
1973,
which
contains
a
one
sentence
harmless
statement
by
mr.
kunstler.
it
has
a
whole
paragraph
of
a
statement
by
mr.
carlson,
the
director
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
within
the
department
justice
stating
the
government’s
view
of
the
case
against
arthur
banks.
now,
it’s
all
there
is.
there
had
not
been
statements
from
january
1
to
april
1.
there
were
these
particular
statements
and
none
other.
mr.
morton
stavis
i’m
sorry
sir
--
mr.
morton
stavis
yes.
mr.
morton
stavis
there’s
no
proof
as
to
where
it
was
published.
it
was
issued
by
the
new
york
--
by
a
committee
having
its
office
in
new
york.
it
was
a
fund
raising
committee
on
behalf
of
arthur
banks.
mr.
morton
stavis
there
is
no
proof
whatsoever
in
this
record
that
a
copy
of
this
in
ever
got
into
terre
haute,
indiana
or
that
any
portion
of
this
ever
got
to
a
newspaper
which
is
published
in
terre
haute
indiana.
mr.
morton
stavis
the
judge
said
“i’ve
got
this
and
hand
it
to
the
government
counsel.
judge
never
explained
how
he
got
it.
now
you
were
also
told
by
my
adversary,
without
reference
to
the
record,
that
mr.
kunstler
threatened
or
promised
to
continue
to
make
statements.
we
are
here
to
find
that
in
the
record.
there’s
nothing
of
that
sort
in
the
record
and
that
of
course
gets
us
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
marshall
asks
which
is,
“did
the
judge
issue
any
other
order,
other
than
debarring
mr.
kunstler”
and
the
answer
is
“no”.
the
hearing
of
april
1
consisted
of
the
introduction
of
these
items,
mostly
furnished
by
the
judge
to
counsel
for
the
government
and
then
the
judge
put
the
axe
down
and
said
to
banks,
“you
can’t
have
kunstler
as
your
lawyer.”
at
no
time
did
the
judge
said,
“i
want
you
to
know
mr.
kunstler
that
is
the
rule
in
this
district
and
if
you’re
going
to
come
in
this
court,
you
are
not
going
to
have
abide
by
those
rules.”
in
fact,
there
was
a
discussion
on
the
record
with
respect
to
the
law
of
the
seventh
circuit
at
that
time
as
expounded
in
the
case
of
chase
against
robson
in
which
my
colleague
for
the
cunningham
was
counsel
in
that
case
and
it
was
clearly
enunciated
by
the
seventh
circuit
that
a
rule
prescribing
speech
by
counsel
could
not
be
adopted
unless
and
until
there
had
been
a
finding
that
such
a
rule
was
necessary
in
that
case
in
order
avoid
interfering
with
the
processes
of
the
court.
now,
mr.
kunstler
said
to
the
judge,
that
as
i
understand
it
is
the
rule
in
the
circuit
and
said
he
felt
bound
by
chase
against
robson
and
he
indicated
that
if
the
judge
felt,
made
a
finding,
then
at
least
the
parties
could
then
proceed
to
litigate
at
the
matter
in
the
seventh
circuit
which
is
exactly
what
they
had
done
in
chase
against
robson.
there
is
not
anything
in
the
record
from
which
it
could
be
concluded
that
mr.
kunstler
said,
i’m
going
to
continue
to
make
those
statements
even
if
you
impose
such
a
prohibition
based
upon
a
finding”
or
even
if
the
judge
had
said,
“well,
the
seventh
circuit
said
you
could
contrary
not
withstanding”
i
say
that
you
shall
not
make
statements.
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
mr.
kunstler
ever
would
have
violated
such
an
order.
now,
we
--
mr.
morton
stavis
yes,
there
was
a
rule
27.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
believe
that’s
to
be
the
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes!
the
lawyer
practicing
in
the
seventh
circuit
would
also
would
know
that
the
seventh
circuit
dealt
with
precisely
that
problem
and
make
its
adjudication
which
was
in
fact
binding
on
all
of
the
district
courts
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
implementation
or
application
of
such
a
rule
would
have
to
await
a
finding
by
the
court
that
it
was
necessary
in
the
particular
case.
now
also
i
point
out
your
honor
that
the
district
court
had
adopted
not
only
rule
27
but
also
rule
29
which
we
printed
in
our
own
brief
because
rule
29
is
the
rule
which
provides
in
fact
for
a
mechanism
and
a
procedure
for
the
court
making
a
finding
in
a
particular
case
that
a
prescription
is
necessary,
and
then
tailoring
the
prescription
to
the
needs
of
that
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
our
submission
and
that
was
the
finding
in
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
both
in
chase
against
robson
and
again
repeated
by
its
holding
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
oh,
yes.
mr.
morton
stavis
oh,
yes.
mr.
morton
stavis
but
i
think
you
will
find
it
on
page
19.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
starts
from
the
bottom
of
page
18.
there
was
actually
two
colloquies
on
this.
one
of
them
is
set
forth
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
18
and
going
over
to
the
top
on
page
19
and
the
other
appears
in
the
footnote
on
page
19.
mr.
morton
stavis
now,
hang
up
with
those
questions,
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
turn,
turn
other
aspect
of
our
argument
and
that
is
that
two
days
after
the
--
mr.
banks
filed
this
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
with
the
seventh
circuit.
and
one
day
after
judge
holder,
filed
a
responsive
pleading
to
that,
he
filed
it
actually
a
day
after
the
mandamus
was
filed.
the
seventh
circuit
ordered
that
he
file
with
it
the
transcript
of
the
entire
proceeding
which
is
actually
had
been
held
before
judge
holder.
that
was
done
and
it
was
based
upon
a
study
of
that
transcript,
the
seventh
circuit
decided
this
particular
case.
one
of
the
difficulties
that
i
think
in
fact
been
had
in
this
case
is
the
petitioner’s
brief
and
its
argument
this
morning,
completely
ignores
the
existence
of
that
transcript
because
it
is
only
there
that
one
begins
to
find
out
the
reality
of
what
this
case
was
about.
and
it’s
because
of
our
conviction
of
the
decisive
nature
of
the
content
of
that
transcript
that
we
called
to
be
xeroxed
filed
with
clerk
of
the
court
deliberately
to
each
of
the
justices
a
copy
of
that
transcript.
because
it’s
to
that
particular
point,
it
is
at
that
particular
point
that
you
begin
to
see
that
what
the
case
involved
was
far
beyond
different
from
the
statements
of
my
adversary
as
to
this
innumerable
statements
which
finally
boil
down
to
a
series
of
statements
on
february
9th.
the
issue
which
emerged
in
that
particular
transcript
was
there
was
an
extraordinary
colloquy
between
judge
holder
and
mr.
kunstler.
judge
holder
forced
mr.
kunstler
to
disclose
his
views
on
number
of
matters
having
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
case,
matters
having
to
do
with
the
draft,
amnesty
and
questions
of
that
sort.
having
forced
to
disclosure
of
these
views
in
open
court,
judge
holder
then
turned
to
mr.
banks
and
said,
do
you
want
a
monkey
on
your
back?”
the
monkey
being,
judge
holder’s
estimate
of
mr.
kunstler’s
views
and
a
rather
eloquent
statements
which
appears
in
the
transcript.
mr.
banks
made
absolutely
clear
that
he
carried
many
monkeys
on
his
back
before.
that
he
knew
exactly
what
mr.
kunstler’s
views
were
and
he
wished
him
to
be
his
lawyer.
following
that,
judge
holder
decided
that
mr.
banks
was
not
to
have
mr.
kunstler
as
his
lawyer,
but
rather
another
present
selected
by
judge
holder
whom
he
described
as
having
proclivities
and
operations
with
which
i
agree.
banks
said,
he
was
going
to
stand
mute.
he
wanted
the
lawyer
of
his
choice.
it
is
pretty
obvious
to
us,
the
lawyer
of
the
defendant’s
choice
is
not
a
lawyer
of
the
judges’
choice
and
the
fact
that
the
judge
may
find
another
lawyer
in
the
indianapolis
or
terre
haute,
whom
he
would
like
to
have
represent
mr.
banks
can’t
be
allowed
to
pass
in
the
face
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
morton
stavis
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
with
respect
to
that.
although
the
rule
provides
for
routine
admission
pro
hac
vice.
that
rule
is
quoted
in
our
brief
and
provides
for
routine
admission.
mr.
morton
stavis
i’m
sorry
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
it’s
45.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
those
are
in
the
page
46,
it’s
the
last
portion
of
c.
an
attorney
admitted
to
practice
in
many
of
the
united
states
court
may
on
application
to
this
court
be
granted
leave
to
appear
on
specific
action
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
though
which
suggests
any
practice
with
respect
to
this
matter.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
based
upon
this
record,
and
of
course
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
looked
at,
when
they
[attempt
to
laughter]
made
their
decision
and
they
say
that,
“in
view
of
the
court,
judge
holder’s
indication
that
he
claimed
concern
for
mr.
banks’
interest,
that
there
was
no
basis
for
overriding
mr.
banks’
expression
of
desire
that
he
be
represented
by
counsel
of
his
choice,
regardless
of
judge
holder’s
disagreement
with
his
views.”
of
course,
none
of
that
is
indicated
in
the
brief
or
the
argument
of
our
adversary,
but
it’s
fully
and
entirely
and
completely
laid
out
in
our
brief
and
we
had
no
choice
but
to
file
the
extended
and
detailed
statements
of
effect
in
order
that
the
court
would
get
the
entire
picture
on
this
case.
having
made
it
clear
on
the
record
why
mr.
banks
was
denied
mr.
kunstler’s
services,
the
following
day
judge
holder
entered
what
he
called
“an
entry,”
in
which
he
purported
to
give
reasons
why
he
denied
mr.
banks'
the
right
to
have
kunstler
as
his
counsel.
he
gave
a
series
of
reasons.
one
is
the
possibilities
of
delay
in
the
trial
with
actually
no
foundation
for
it
whatsoever.
there
was
no
indication
whatsoever
that
had
this
case
been
heard
in
may
as
had
been
specified
that
mr.
kunstler,
may
of
1973
that
is,
mr.
kunstler
as
his
lawyer,
and
it
was
clear
on
the
record
on
april
1st
that
mr.
barnhart
was
then
full
co-counsel
with
mr.
kunstler,
actually
nothing
to
indicate
that
mr.
kunstler
would
not
have
proceeded
to
try
that
case
en
banc
or
if
for
some
reason
the
counsel
were
not
available,
the
case
might
not
have
proceeded
with
mr.
barnhart
alone,
particularly
if
judge
holder
said
“i’ll
let
you
in,
but
if
your
not
here
the
case
is
going
ahead
anyhow,”
absolutely
nothing
to
support
any
indication
of
delay.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
is
a
simple
issue
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
i
think
that
is
the
whole
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeal
was
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
transcended
all
the
other
matters
in
this
case
and
they
direct
it
on
this
particular
record
and
that
mr.
banks
--
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
one
of
the
issues
of
law
i
felt
though
it
was
passingly
conceded
this
morning,
namely
the
--
any
suggestion
that
there
was
anymore
of
a
court
with
respect
to
out
of
district
counsel
then
there
was
with
respect
in
this
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
i
don’t
think
that’s
an
issue
here
because
it
seems
to
me
that
there
isn't
any
question
that
the
court's
reserve
and
have
the
power
to
discipline
counsel
for
violation
of
rules.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
suppose
the
sixth
amendment
--
mr.
morton
stavis
yes,
i
understand.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
might
depend
because
the
court
might
decide
that
the
gar
election
by
the
lawyer
in
that
particular
case
did
not
merit
immediate
suspension.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
could
be
to
this
extent,
sixth
amendment
is
your
right
to
counsel,
it
doesn’t
give
you
right
that
counsel.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
mr.
morton
stavis
that’s
right.
mr.
morton
stavis
and
we’ve
never
thought.
mr.
morton
stavis
that’s
right
and
we
never
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
agree
and
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court
need
go
any
further
there.
a
simple
determination
that
on
this
record
as
found
by
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right
and
banks
was
entitled
to
counsel
of
his
choice.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
i
don’t
think
he
can.
i
think
that
the
record
is
made
by
the
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
decision
here
can
be
most
limited
in
nature.
limited
to
the
order
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
was
on
this
particular
record,
mr.
banks
was
entitled
to
have
counsel
of
his
choice
and
if
there
was
any
question
in
the
judge's
mind
that
counsels
conduct
might
have
adversely
effected
the
banks’
chance,
that
banks
had
waived
it
and
the
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
i
was
not.
it
was
not
orally
argued.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
was
not
orally
argued.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
judge
holder
tried
to
blatantly
issue.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
he
got
into
this
whole
question
of
rule
27.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes,
i
think
that
the
issue
that
was
sought
to
be
presented
by
the
petitioner
for
rehearing.
mr.
morton
stavis
and
which
the
court
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no.
mr.
morton
stavis
said,
it
hadn’t
been
brought
up
before,
but
its
not
too
late,
we‘ll
take
a
look
at
it
anyhow.
and
looking
at
that
question,
and
looking
at
that
question
they
then
said,
repeated
their
basic
approach
that
they
had
enunciated
in
chase
against
robson.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes.
but
coming
from
the
petition
for
rehearing
which
was
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that’s
right.
that’s
right
and
may
that
will
be.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
could
be,
it
could
be
but
candidly
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
need
to
go
to
that
point
in
deciding
this
case.
for
the
following
reason,
among
others,
this
would
be
a
very
inappropriate
case
we
would
think
to
deal
with
the
effort
to
make
rather
radical,
broad
and
sweeping
changes
in
the
whole
question
about
the
relationships
between
members
of
the
bar
and
the
media.
the
sort
of
problems
that
were
originally
suggested
in
sheppard
against
maxwell
that
were
covered
in
the
rearden
committee
report
and
again
in
the
kaufman
committee
report
and
while
it
may
very
well
be
that
these
rules
have
been
adopted
in
all
district
courts
as
mr.
justice
marshall
points
out,
they’ve
never
been
passed
on
by
this
court.
that
would
effect
a
most
significant
change
in
the
history
of
a
150
years
that
goes
back
to
the
impeachment
trial
of
judge
peck
and
a
series
of
cases
determined
by
this
court
following
that
craig
against
harney,
bridges
against
california,
and
right
down
in
the
last
month
when
it
decided
the
case
of
ethan
against
tulsa.
i
simply
suggest
that
if
the
court
is
to
enter
into
a
consideration
of
the
extraordinarily
complicated
first
amendment
issues
that
were
involved
there,
it
ought
to
do
so
in
a
case
which
is
so
related
with
sixth
amendment
questions.
because
nobody
had
ever
direct
that
any
procedure
that
a
court
might
employ
to
control
expressions
by
counsel
will
be
enforced
by
any
means
other
than
the
discipline
of
counsel.
and
to
have
that
issue
come
before
this
court
for
the
very
first
time
in
a
case
which
is
so
easily
determined
on
the
issue
of
right
of
counsel,
i
would
suggest
would
be
most
unfortunate.
mr.
morton
stavis
but
i
would
think
in
the
question
in
the
state
courts
would
be
quite
different
or
might
be
quite
different
than
the
question
in
the
federal
courts.
and
i
don’t
think
the
court
in
deciding
this
case
in
respect
to
its
supervisory
power
of
the
federal
courts
would
have
to
adjudicate
any
question
with
respect
to
state
courts.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
could
be
wrong
on
the
--
mr.
morton
stavis
but
the
bergamo
decision
at
the
third
circuit,
sakura’s
decision
in
the
second
circuit
would
indicate
that
at
least
in
the
federal
system,
particularly
because
of
the
unitary
nature
of
federal
system
--
mr.
morton
stavis
in
a
federal
court--
mr.
morton
stavis
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court,
a
member
of
bar
seventh
circuit
and
it
had
a
certain
absurdity
about
it.
mr.
kunstler
can
represent
mr.
banks.
he
might
have
argued
the
case
here
before
you
today
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
he
has
been
so
overwhelmed
and
wounded
knees
that
he
asked
father
cunningham
and
myself
to
take
over
this
responsibility
for
him.
mr.
morton
stavis
the
petition
for
rehearing.
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
morton
stavis
oh,
the
order
was
printed
in
the
petitioner
for
writ
of
--
mr.
morton
stavis
there
is
a
record.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes,
the
original
record
that.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
morton
stavis
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
morton
stavis
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
answer
i’d
like
to
settle
a
few
of
the
questions
that
arose
in
the
course
of
my
adversary’s
argument.
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justices
rehnquist
and
brennan,
banks
is
here,
seated
in
front
row.
he
was
released
on
bail
by
united
states
district
court
in
minnesota
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
we
start
with
questions
as
to
incarceration
based
upon
his
prior
conviction
as
well
as
certain
questions
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
his
present
indictment.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right,
sir.
that
mr.
kunstler
was
his
attorney
in
that
matter
and
in
view
of
the
fact
the
government
of
united
states
brought
a
habeas,
brought
a
mandamus
before
the
eighth
circuit.
judge
lord
in
that
case,
questioned
mr.
kunstler
to
represent
him
as
a
respondent
from
the
mandamus
proceeding.
mr.
kunstler
is
now
representing
judge
lord
before
the
eight
circuit
and
an
order
has
been
handed
down
by
the
eight
circuit
on
the
date
of
april
19,
1974,
requiring
filing
of
briefs
and
setting
a
hearing
there
on
june
10,
1974
at
which
you
will
get
--
at
which
mr.
kunstler
expects
to
represent
judge
lord.
mr.
morton
stavis
the
issue
was
among
other
things
with
respect
to
the
prior
incarcerations,
mr.
banks
had
been
kept
in
solitary
confinement
for
approximately
18
months.
mr.
morton
stavis
none
whatsoever.
furthermore
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
don’t
believe
--
i
don’t
believe
they
do
accepting
with
respect
to
one
question.
it
was
also
as
to
which
my
adversary
indicated
they
didn’t
know
the
answer
and
that
is
that
mr.
kunstler
indubitably
represents
mr.
banks.
i
spoke
to
mr.
banks
during
the
luncheon
recess,
but
i
didn’t
really
have
to.
he
has
said
that
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
he
intends
to
do
is
to
alter
his
relationship
with
mr.
kunstler
the
man
to
whom
he
now
owes
his
freedom.
i’d
like
now
to
turn
to
some
of
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
and
some
of
the
rather
confusing
answers
that
i
thought
have
been
given
in
response
to
those
questions.
mr.
kunstler
was
not
retained
until
february
9,
1973.
that
was
the
first
time
that
was
mr.
kunstler
ever
meet
mr.
banks
and
whatever
the
record
may
show
as
to
prior
statements
by
mr.
banks
that
he
had
retained
mr.
bloomberg
to
whom
he
paid
a
fee
and
also
mr.
kunstler
in
some
secondary
capacity
to
mr.
bloomberg.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
first
time
mr.
kunstler
met
mr.
banks
and
accepted
to
retain,
it
was
on
february
9.
secondly,
there
was
not
a
continuous
range
of
statements
from
january
1st
up
until
april
1,
1973.
all
of
the
statements
which
appeared
in
the
record,
all
of
them
are
attached
to
our
brief
and
they
consist
of
the
following.
number
one,
an
interview
sought
out
by
a
newspaper
reporter
in
indianapolis,
indiana
had
a
cocktail
party
which
mr.
kunstler
attended,
the
result
of
which
was
an
item
appearing
in
the
indianapolis
star
on
february
10
on
page
31.
there
was
not
a
shred
of
proof
that
that
newspaper
was
distributed
in
terre
haute,
indiana,
95
miles
away
and
moreover
and
we
think
it's
of
particular
important,
terre
haute
has
separate
jury
rules
from
the
indianapolis.
secondly
--
mr.
morton
stavis
different
divisions
within
districts
—
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right
and
separate
jury
laws
and
we
refer
to
that
if
we
cited
enough
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that’s
right.
that’s
the
statement.
that’s
the
interview
at
the
cocktail
party.
the
second
item
is
a
press
release
issued
at
the
organization
in
new
york
on
the
same
day,
february
9
with
no
proof
whatsoever
that
it
ever
got
anywhere
near
terre
haute,
indiana.
the
third
item
is
a
one
minute
statement
by
a
tv
reporter,
who
does
not
report
accurately
to
call
mr.
kunstler
and
which
refers
to
a
speech
that
mr.
kunstler
made
again
on
february
9.
the
last
item
was
an
item
which
appears
on
time
magazine
on
the
date
of
february
26,
1973,
which
contains
a
one
sentence
harmless
statement
by
mr.
kunstler.
it
has
a
whole
paragraph
of
a
statement
by
mr.
carlson,
the
director
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
within
the
department
justice
stating
the
government’s
view
of
the
case
against
arthur
banks.
now,
it’s
all
there
is.
there
had
not
been
statements
from
january
1
to
april
1.
there
were
these
particular
statements
and
none
other.
mr.
morton
stavis
i’m
sorry
sir
--
mr.
morton
stavis
yes.
mr.
morton
stavis
there’s
no
proof
as
to
where
it
was
published.
it
was
issued
by
the
new
york
--
by
a
committee
having
its
office
in
new
york.
it
was
a
fund
raising
committee
on
behalf
of
arthur
banks.
mr.
morton
stavis
there
is
no
proof
whatsoever
in
this
record
that
a
copy
of
this
in
ever
got
into
terre
haute,
indiana
or
that
any
portion
of
this
ever
got
to
a
newspaper
which
is
published
in
terre
haute
indiana.
mr.
morton
stavis
the
judge
said
“i’ve
got
this
and
hand
it
to
the
government
counsel.
judge
never
explained
how
he
got
it.
now
you
were
also
told
by
my
adversary,
without
reference
to
the
record,
that
mr.
kunstler
threatened
or
promised
to
continue
to
make
statements.
we
are
here
to
find
that
in
the
record.
there’s
nothing
of
that
sort
in
the
record
and
that
of
course
gets
us
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
marshall
asks
which
is,
“did
the
judge
issue
any
other
order,
other
than
debarring
mr.
kunstler”
and
the
answer
is
“no”.
the
hearing
of
april
1
consisted
of
the
introduction
of
these
items,
mostly
furnished
by
the
judge
to
counsel
for
the
government
and
then
the
judge
put
the
axe
down
and
said
to
banks,
“you
can’t
have
kunstler
as
your
lawyer.”
at
no
time
did
the
judge
said,
“i
want
you
to
know
mr.
kunstler
that
is
the
rule
in
this
district
and
if
you’re
going
to
come
in
this
court,
you
are
not
going
to
have
abide
by
those
rules.”
in
fact,
there
was
a
discussion
on
the
record
with
respect
to
the
law
of
the
seventh
circuit
at
that
time
as
expounded
in
the
case
of
chase
against
robson
in
which
my
colleague
for
the
cunningham
was
counsel
in
that
case
and
it
was
clearly
enunciated
by
the
seventh
circuit
that
a
rule
prescribing
speech
by
counsel
could
not
be
adopted
unless
and
until
there
had
been
a
finding
that
such
a
rule
was
necessary
in
that
case
in
order
avoid
interfering
with
the
processes
of
the
court.
now,
mr.
kunstler
said
to
the
judge,
that
as
i
understand
it
is
the
rule
in
the
circuit
and
said
he
felt
bound
by
chase
against
robson
and
he
indicated
that
if
the
judge
felt,
made
a
finding,
then
at
least
the
parties
could
then
proceed
to
litigate
at
the
matter
in
the
seventh
circuit
which
is
exactly
what
they
had
done
in
chase
against
robson.
there
is
not
anything
in
the
record
from
which
it
could
be
concluded
that
mr.
kunstler
said,
i’m
going
to
continue
to
make
those
statements
even
if
you
impose
such
a
prohibition
based
upon
a
finding”
or
even
if
the
judge
had
said,
“well,
the
seventh
circuit
said
you
could
contrary
not
withstanding”
i
say
that
you
shall
not
make
statements.
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
mr.
kunstler
ever
would
have
violated
such
an
order.
now,
we
--
mr.
morton
stavis
yes,
there
was
a
rule
27.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
i
believe
that’s
to
be
the
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes!
the
lawyer
practicing
in
the
seventh
circuit
would
also
would
know
that
the
seventh
circuit
dealt
with
precisely
that
problem
and
make
its
adjudication
which
was
in
fact
binding
on
all
of
the
district
courts
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
implementation
or
application
of
such
a
rule
would
have
to
await
a
finding
by
the
court
that
it
was
necessary
in
the
particular
case.
now
also
i
point
out
your
honor
that
the
district
court
had
adopted
not
only
rule
27
but
also
rule
29
which
we
printed
in
our
own
brief
because
rule
29
is
the
rule
which
provides
in
fact
for
a
mechanism
and
a
procedure
for
the
court
making
a
finding
in
a
particular
case
that
a
prescription
is
necessary,
and
then
tailoring
the
prescription
to
the
needs
of
that
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
our
submission
and
that
was
the
finding
in
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
both
in
chase
against
robson
and
again
repeated
by
its
holding
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
oh,
yes.
mr.
morton
stavis
oh,
yes.
mr.
morton
stavis
but
i
think
you
will
find
it
on
page
19.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
starts
from
the
bottom
of
page
18.
there
was
actually
two
colloquies
on
this.
one
of
them
is
set
forth
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
18
and

mr.
morton
stavis
now,
hang
up
with
those
questions,
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
turn,
turn
other
aspect
of
our
argument
and
that
is
that
two
days
after
the
--
mr.
banks
filed
this
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
with
the
seventh
circuit.
and
one
day
after
judge
holder,
filed
a
responsive
pleading
to
that,
he
filed
it
actually
a
day
after
the
mandamus
was
filed.
the
seventh
circuit
ordered
that
he
file
with
it
the
transcript
of
the
entire
proceeding
which
is
actually
had
been
held
before
judge
holder.
that
was
done
and
it
was
based
upon
a
study
of
that
transcript,
the
seventh
circuit
decided
this
particular
case.
one
of
the
difficulties
that
i
think
in
fact
been
had
in
this
case
is
the
petitioner’s
brief
and
its
argument
this
morning,
completely
ignores
the
existence
of
that
transcript
because
it
is
only
there
that
one
begins
to
find
out
the
reality
of
what
this
case
was
about.
and
it’s
because
of
our
conviction
of
the
decisive
nature
of
the
content
of
that
transcript
that
we
called
to
be
xeroxed
filed
with
clerk
of
the
court
deliberately
to
each
of
the
justices
a
copy
of
that
transcript.
because
it’s
to
that
particular
point,
it
is
at
that
particular
point
that
you
begin
to
see
that
what
the
case
involved
was
far
beyond
different
from
the
statements
of
my
adversary
as
to
this
innumerable
statements
which
finally
boil
down
to
a
series
of
statements
on
february
9th.
the
issue
which
emerged
in
that
particular
transcript
was
there
was
an
extraordinary
colloquy
between
judge
holder
and
mr.
kunstler.
judge
holder
forced
mr.
kunstler
to
disclose
his
views
on
number
of
matters
having
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
case,
matters
having
to
do
with
the
draft,
amnesty
and
questions
of
that
sort.
having
forced
to
disclosure
of
these
views
in
open
court,
judge
holder
then
turned
to
mr.
banks
and
said,
do
you
want
a
monkey
on
your
back?”
the
monkey
being,
judge
holder’s
estimate
of
mr.
kunstler’s
views
and
a
rather
eloquent
statements
which
appears
in
the
transcript.
mr.
banks
made
absolutely
clear
that
he
carried
many
monkeys
on
his
back
before.
that
he
knew
exactly
what
mr.
kunstler’s
views
were
and
he
wished
him
to
be
his
lawyer.
following
that,
judge
holder
decided
that
mr.
banks
was
not
to
have
mr.
kunstler
as
his
lawyer,
but
rather
another
present
selected
by
judge
holder
whom
he
described
as
having
proclivities
and
operations
with
which
i
agree.
banks
said,
he
was
going
to
stand
mute.
he
wanted
the
lawyer
of
his
choice.
it
is
pretty
obvious
to
us,
the
lawyer
of
the
defendant’s
choice
is
not
a
lawyer
of
the
judges’
choice
and
the
fact
that
the
judge
may
find
another
lawyer
in
the
indianapolis
or
terre
haute,
whom
he
would
like
to
have
represent
mr.
banks
can’t
be
allowed
to
pass
in
the
face
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
morton
stavis
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
with
respect
to
that.
although
the
rule
provides
for
routine
admission
pro
hac
vice.
that
rule
is
quoted
in
our
brief
and
provides
for
routine
admission.
mr.
morton
stavis
i’m
sorry
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
think
it’s
45.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
those
are
in
the
page
46,
it’s
the
last
portion
of
c.
an
attorney
admitted
to
practice
in
many
of
the
united
states
court
may
on
application
to
this
court
be
granted
leave
to
appear
on
specific
action
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
though
which
suggests
any
practice
with
respect
to
this
matter.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
based
upon
this
record,
and
of
course
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
looked
at,
when
they
[attempt
to
laughter]
made
their
decision
and
they
say
that,
“in
view
of
the
court,
judge
holder’s
indication
that
he
claimed
concern
for
mr.
banks’
interest,
that
there
was
no
basis
for
overriding
mr.
banks’
expression
of
desire
that
he
be
represented
by
counsel
of
his
choice,
regardless
of
judge
holder’s
disagreement
with
his
views.”
of
course,
none
of
that
is
indicated
in
the
brief
or
the
argument
of
our
adversary,
but
it’s
fully
and
entirely
and
completely
laid
out
in
our
brief
and
we
had
no
choice
but
to
file
the
extended
and
detailed
statements
of
effect
in
order
that
the
court
would
get
the
entire
picture
on
this
case.
having
made
it
clear
on
the
record
why
mr.
banks
was
denied
mr.
kunstler’s
services,
the
following
day
judge
holder
entered
what
he
called
“an
entry,”
in
which
he
purported
to
give
reasons
why
he
denied
mr.
banks'
the
right
to
have
kunstler
as
his
counsel.
he
gave
a
series
of
reasons.
one
is
the
possibilities
of
delay
in
the
trial
with
actually
no
foundation
for
it
whatsoever.
there
was
no
indication
whatsoever
that
had
this
case
been
heard
in
may
as
had
been
specified
that
mr.
kunstler,
may
of
1973
that
is,
mr.
kunstler
as
his
lawyer,
and
it
was
clear
on
the
record
on
april
1st
that
mr.
barnhart
was
then
full
co-counsel
with
mr.
kunstler,
actually
nothing
to
indicate
that
mr.
kunstler
would
not
have
proceeded
to
try
that
case
en
banc
or
if
for
some
reason
the
counsel
were
not
available,
the
case
might
not
have
proceeded
with
mr.
barnhart
alone,
particularly
if
judge
holder
said
“i’ll
let
you
in,
but
if
your
not
here
the
case
is
going
ahead
anyhow,”
absolutely
nothing
to
support
any
indication
of
delay.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
is
a
simple
issue
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
i
think
that
is
the
whole
case.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeal
was
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
transcended
all
the
other
matters
in
this
case
and
they
direct
it
on
this
particular
record
and
that
mr.
banks
--
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
one
of
the
issues
of
law
i
felt
though
it
was
passingly
conceded
this
morning,
namely
the
--
any
suggestion
that
there
was
anymore
of
a
court
with
respect
to
out
of
district
counsel
then
there
was
with
respect
in
this
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
i
don’t
think
that’s
an
issue
here
because
it
seems
to
me
that
there
isn't
any
question
that
the
court's
reserve
and
have
the
power
to
discipline
counsel
for
violation
of
rules.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
suppose
the
sixth
amendment
--
mr.
morton
stavis
yes,
i
understand.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
might
depend
because
the
court
might
decide
that
the
gar
election
by
the
lawyer
in
that
particular
case
did
not
merit
immediate
suspension.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
could
be
to
this
extent,
sixth
amendment
is
your
right
to
counsel,
it
doesn’t
give
you
right
that
counsel.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
mr.
morton
stavis
that’s
right.
mr.
morton
stavis
and
we’ve
never
thought.
mr.
morton
stavis
that’s
right
and
we
never
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
agree
and
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court
need
go
any
further
there.
a
simple
determination
that
on
this
record
as
found
by
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right
and
banks
was
entitled
to
counsel
of
his
choice.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
i
don’t
think
he
can.
i
think
that
the
record
is
made
by
the
--
mr.
morton
stavis
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
decision
here
can
be
most
limited
in
nature.
limited
to
the
order
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
was
on
this
particular
record,
mr.
banks
was
entitled
to
have
counsel
of
his
choice
and
if
there
was
any
question
in
the
judge's
mind
that
counsels
conduct
might
have
adversely
effected
the
banks’
chance,
that
banks
had
waived
it
and
the
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no,
i
was
not.
it
was
not
orally
argued.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
was
not
orally
argued.
mr.
morton
stavis
well,
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
judge
holder
tried
to
blatantly
issue.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
right.
he
got
into
this
whole
question
of
rule
27.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes,
i
think
that
the
issue
that
was
sought
to
be
presented
by
the
petitioner
for
rehearing.
mr.
morton
stavis
and
which
the
court
--
mr.
morton
stavis
no.
mr.
morton
stavis
said,
it
hadn’t
been
brought
up
before,
but
its
not
too
late,
we‘ll
take
a
look
at
it
anyhow.
and
looking
at
that
question,
and
looking
at
that
question
they
then
said,
repeated
their
basic
approach
that
they
had
enunciated
in
chase
against
robson.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes.
but
coming
from
the
petition
for
rehearing
which
was
--
mr.
morton
stavis
that’s
right.
that’s
right
and
may
that
will
be.
mr.
morton
stavis
that
is
correct.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
could
be,
it
could
be
but
candidly
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
need
to
go
to
that
point
in
deciding
this
case.
for
the
following
reason,
among
others,
this
would
be
a
very
inappropriate
case
we
would
think
to
deal
with
the
effort
to
make
rather
radical,
broad
and
sweeping
changes
in
the
whole
question
about
the
relationships
between
members
of
the
bar
and
the
media.
the
sort
of
problems
that
were
originally
suggested
in
sheppard
against
maxwell
that
were
covered
in
the
rearden
committee
report
and
again
in
the
kaufman
committee
report
and
while
it
may
very
well
be
that
these
rules
have
been
adopted
in
all
district
courts
as
mr.
justice
marshall
points
out,
they’ve
never
been
passed
on
by
this
court.
that
would
effect
a
most
significant
change
in
the
history
of
a
150
years
that
goes
back
to
the
impeachment
trial
of
judge
peck
and
a
series
of
cases
determined
by
this
court
following
that
craig
against
harney,
bridges
against
california,
and
right
down
in
the
last
month
when
it
decided
the
case
of
ethan
against
tulsa.
i
simply
suggest
that
if
the
court
is
to
enter
into
a
consideration
of
the
extraordinarily
complicated
first
amendment
issues
that
were
involved
there,
it
ought
to
do
so
in
a
case
which
is
so
related
with
sixth
amendment
questions.
because
nobody
had
ever
direct
that
any
procedure
that
a
court
might
employ
to
control
expressions
by
counsel
will
be
enforced
by
any
means
other
than
the
discipline
of
counsel.
and
to
have
that
issue
come
before
this
court
for
the
very
first
time
in
a
case
which
is
so
easily
determined
on
the
issue
of
right
of
counsel,
i
would
suggest
would
be
most
unfortunate.
mr.
morton
stavis
but
i
would
think
in
the
question
in
the
state
courts
would
be
quite
different
or
might
be
quite
different
than
the
question
in
the
federal
courts.
and
i
don’t
think
the
court
in
deciding
this
case
in
respect
to
its
supervisory
power
of
the
federal
courts
would
have
to
adjudicate
any
question
with
respect
to
state
courts.
mr.
morton
stavis
it
could
be
wrong
on
the
--
mr.
morton
stavis
but
the
bergamo
decision
at
the
third
circuit,
sakura’s
decision
in
the
second
circuit
would
indicate
that
at
least
in
the
federal
system,
particularly
because
of
the
unitary
nature
of
federal
system
--
mr.
morton
stavis
in
a
federal
court--
mr.
morton
stavis
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court,
a
member
of
bar
seventh
circuit
and
it
had
a
certain
absurdity
about
it.
mr.
kunstler
can
represent
mr.
banks.
he
might
have
argued
the
case
here
before
you
today
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
he
has
been
so
overwhelmed
and
wounded
knees
that
he
asked
father
cunningham
and
myself
to
take
over
this
responsibility
for
him.
mr.
morton
stavis
the
petition
for
rehearing.
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
morton
stavis
oh,
the
order
was
printed
in
the
petitioner
for
writ
of
--
mr.
morton
stavis
there
is
a
record.
mr.
morton
stavis
yes,
the
original
record
that.
thank
you
very
much.
