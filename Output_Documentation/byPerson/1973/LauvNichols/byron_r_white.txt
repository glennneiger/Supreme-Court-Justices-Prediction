justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
have
the
same
objection
if
they
taught
them
in
chinese?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn’t
complain
if
they
taught
them
in
chinese?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
you
wanted
them
to
learn
english
so
that
they
could
survive
in
our
society.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
how
many
other
students
from
the
so-called
ghetto
besides
these
1,800
are
in
the
schools?
how
many
total
ghetto
school
children
are
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
that
you
like
--
and
you,
you
complain
only
about
1,800
of
them
who
aren’t
passable
in
english?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
i
never
did
get
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
on
why
--
you
say
the
record
is
just
silent
on
this
as
to
why.
here,
there
may
be
five
or
10,000
other
ghetto
chinese
students
who
although
they
come
from
the
ghetto
are
perfectly
competent
to
learn
english,
to
understand
english.
now
what’s
the
reason
about
these
1,800?
did
you
ever
answer
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
think,
it
carried
your
burden
of
proof
if
that
isn’t
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
for
whatever
reason
or
whatever
reason
a
person
comes
to
the
school
not
knowingly
english,
your
position
is
that
he
must
--
that
the
school
has
an
obligation
to
take
some
special
steps
to
make
him
passable
in
english?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
but
now,
whatever
your
position,
for
whatever
your
reason
that
the
child
comes
to
school
without
knowing
english,
the
school
system
must
take
some
special
steps
for
teaching
english?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
majority
of
which
children
from
that
group
know
english?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
reach
all
the
districts
involved
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
thought
--
do
you
think
our
recent
opinion
in
the
karl
case
bears
on
this
one
at
all,
in
terms
of
the
significance
of
your
guidelines
and
their
validity?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you’re
claiming
this
is
an
act
of
words
in
discriminating?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
although
nothing
reads
on
national
origin
in
school
district
policies
because
they
teach
--
they
certainly
had
met
chinese,
they
treat
all
chinese
the
same
as
whites.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
those
that
they
give
special
instruction
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
your
point,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
are
right,
we
agree
with
you
on
the
statutory
basis,
it
will
be
quite
inappropriate
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
at
al,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
relate
other
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
all
courts
were
obliged
to
deal
with
statutory
issues
or
constitutional
issues
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
weren’t
getting
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
the
statute
itself
or
the
regulations
--
let’s
assume
the
statute
itself
expressly
said
that
in
order
to
qualify
for
grants,
the
states
must
undertake
training
in
english
language
for
those
who
need
it
such
as
the
chinese
in
san
francisco,
let’s
assume
that
it
said
that
expressly.
would
you
have
any
doubt
about
the
congressional
power
to
enact
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
is
--
what
constitutional
power
would
you
consider
that
to
be
an
exercise
of,
the
spending
power
to
condition
of
a
grant
of
money
on
rational
conditions?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not,
i
mean
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
valid
under
fourteenth
amendment
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
congress
did
say,
they
have
said
that
and
you
would
think
that
it
constitutionally
could,
would
san
francisco
be
bound
by
it
in
the
sense
--
is
san
francisco
participating
in
this
grant
program
so
that
you
would
be
bound
with
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
we
construed
the
statute
or
construed
the
ranks
or
the
guidelines
to
the
same
effect,
then
i
suppose
we
would
be
--
necessarily
we
would
decide
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
withdraw
it,
you
could
withdraw
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
sooner
or
later
they
will
learn
to
communicate,
but
not
very
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
hasn’t
been
what
your
colleague
there
said
a
little
while
ago,
he
said
it
was
effective?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
remember
one
of
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
give
me
an
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
have
the

if
they
