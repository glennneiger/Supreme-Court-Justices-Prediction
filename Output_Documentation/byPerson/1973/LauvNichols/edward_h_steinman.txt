mr.
edward
h.
steinman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
devote
the
20
minutes
of
my
opening
argument
to
the
constitutional
issues
raised
in
this
case.
i
would
then
be
followed
by
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger,
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
united
states
who
will
address
himself
to
the
statutory
violation
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
a
discrimination
suffered
by
nearly
1,800
non-english-speaking
chinese
students
in
san
francisco
in
the
provision
of
educational
benefits
and
opportunities.
both
the
federal
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
were
satisfied
that
so
long
as
the
san
francisco
school
system
provides
the
same
instruction,
the
same
materials,
the
same
teachers
to
all
students,
then
equal
protection
clause
is
satisfied,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
these
students
since
they
do
not
understand
english
and
since
they
are
sitting
in
classes
where
english
is
the
instruction
which
is
the
language
of
instruction,
regardless
the
fact
that
these
students
cannot
learn.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
they
are
both
chinese-americans,
they
are
both
native-born
and
they
are
also
foreign-born,
your
honor.
the
school
system
(inaudible)
interrogatories
said
that
it
does
not
keep
records
on
the
origin
of
birth
or
on
citizenship
of
the
students,
but
of
the
seven
named
petitioners
before
this
court;
five
of
them
are
native-born
american
citizens.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
yes,
five
of
them,
david
leung,
david
san,
judy
san,
karen
lee,
karen
yee
and
john
yee
(ph).
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
oh
definitely!
i
think
it’s
clear
that
many
members
of
the
1,800
students
that
we
represent
are
recent
immigrants.
i
think
though
that
one
thing
must
be
pointed
out
which
was
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief
of
petitioners
that
the
immigration
laws
were
relaxed
in
the
mid
60’s
and
the
new
laws
went
into
effect
on
july
1,
1968.
yet
the
defendants
in
their
own
survey
conducted
in
november
of
1967,
seven
months
before
the
new
immigration
laws
even
went
into
effect,
admitted
that
they
were
close
to
2,000
non-english
speaking
chinese
students
who
as
the
petitioners
are
before
you
effectively
excluded
from
education.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
in
the
school
population
of
san
francisco,
in
the
record
of
the
case,
there
are
approximately,
one
figure
as
13,000
from
the
city
attorney,
one
figure
as
15,000
from
the
school
district.
there
are
also
3,000
chinese-speaking
students
in
san
francisco
of
which
the
petitioners
represent
approximately
63%
of
those.
the
petitioners
represent
those
chinese-speaking
students,
your
honor,
who
received
nothing
except
the
regular
instruction
in
english.
in
the
lower
court
below,
there
was
another
class,
a
group
of
petitioners
who
were
non-english
speaking
chinese
students
who
did
receive
some
special
help.
those
petitioners
are
not
before
this
court.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
the
total
number
of
chinese
students
within
the
san
francisco
school
system.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
probably
between
10%
and
15%,
depending
on
which
figure
it
is.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
don’t
think
that
it
can
--
based
on
the
facts
in
the
case
your
honor
although
the
school
system
does
not
break
it
down.
as
i
said,
seven
months
before
the
immigration
laws
even
went
into
affect,
the
school
system
admitted
that
there
were
nearly
2,000
non-english-speaking
chinese
students
who
received
nothing.
the
november
1967
survey
admitted
there
were
approximately
2,400
non-english-speaking
chinese
students
within
the
entire
school
district.
and
of
those
2,400
merely
2,000
were
in
the
same
type
of
dilemma
according
to
petitioners.
they
don’t
speak
english,
they
don’t
understand
english
and
yet
their
entire
instructional
program
is
in
regular
classes
where
english
is
the
language
of
the
instruction.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
why
they
don’t
speak
english,
of
course,
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
think
that
these
court
can
take
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
the
chinese
community
in
san
francisco
is
what
we
refer
to
as
a
ghetto.
it’s
quite
insular
and
when
the
students
who
are
born
in
this
country,
come
to
the
schools,
they
do
not
have
the
facilities
in
english
and
unfortunately
the
actions
of
the
school
system
perpetuate
that
inability
to
speak
english.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
don’t
know
the
facts
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
don’t
know,
i
don’t
think
we
can
speak
in
terms
of
those,
but
i
think
we
can
speak
in
terms
of
the
1,800
students,
a
vast
percentage
or
native-born
americans
who
have
lived
their
entire
lives
in
san
francisco,
and
have
come
into
the
school
system
speaking
no
english.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well
again,
i
cannot
address
that
because
it
is
not
in
the
record.
all
i
can
rely
on
the
fact
that
in
1967,
the
school
system
admitted
even
before
the
immigration
laws
were
changed
that
there
would
2,000
students
in
the
school
system
right
then
who
were
chinese-speaking
who
do
not
speak
english
and
this
was
before
the
immigration
laws
were
even
changed.
so
that
is
all
i
can
surmise
for
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
oh
no!
our
goal
is
the
same
announced
goal
that
the
school
system
in
the
state
of
california
has
made.
our
goal
is
that
we
want
these
students
to
be
taught
english
and
to
understand
english,
so
they
can
have
the
type
of
mastered
english
which
our
society
requires.
the
problem
now
is
that
they
are
being
taught
in
a
language
they
do
not
understand.
and
we
would
like
the
school
system
to
do
is
to
take
whatever
steps
are
reasonable
and
this
of
course
is
within
their
province
since
they
are
the
experts
in
this
area,
to
take
whatever
steps
that
are
reasonable
to
guarantee
that
these
students
are
able
to
benefit
with
the
instruction
they
are
given.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
the
school
system
decided
that
teaching
them
in
chinese
was
the
most
effective
method
that
would
be
a
bilingual
method,
your
honor.
the
school
system
decided
that
teaching
them
in
chinese
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
so
long
as
they
would
be
able
to
understand
the
language
of
the
instruction
which
they’re
getting
throughout
the
school
system.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
under
the
state
--
under
the
law
of
state
of
california,
the
school
system
must
primarily
teach
them
in
english.
so
if
the
school
system
will
not
teach
them
totally
in
chinese,
the
school
system
might
wish
to
employ
chinese-speaking
teachers
in
a
bilingual
setting,
that
is
their
choice.
our
complaint
is
not
with
methodology.
we’re
not
asking
this
court
to
get
involved
in
petty
illogical
questions.
our
complaint
is
that
right
now,
the
school
system
is
utilizing
no
methods
based
on
their
own
admissions
if
i
can
refer
the
court
to
the
appendix.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
again
the
school
system
has
not
broken
down
the
place
from
which
the
chinese
students
come.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
i
can
just
cite
to
the
fact
that
there
are
san
francisco
schools
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
brought,
either
13,000
or
15,000
chinese
students
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
we’re
complaining
of
the
1,800
who
were
non-english
speaking
chinese
students.
i
guess
the
court
--
there
are
different
classes
the
court
can
look
at.
in
our
brief,
what
we
have
done
is
we
have
said
that
in
san
francisco
there
are
approximately
90,000
students
who
are
given
instructions
from
which
they
can
receive
educational
benefits
and
opportunities
whereas
there
are
1,800
students
who
are
foreclosed
from
receiving
any
opportunity.
in
essence
it’s
effect
of
exclusion.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
cannot
tell
you
why
these
1,800
came
to
school
and
not
knowing
english
and
other
chinese
students
do.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
oh,
i
think
we
have
because
i
think
we
have
shown
that
the
school
system
has
admitted
that
these
1,800
students
receive
today
no
educational
opportunities.
if
i
my
quote
the
record
at
page
56
of
the
appendix,
the
school
system
says
these
students
“must
learn
english
to
function
in
a
regular
classroom.”
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well
the
school
district,
your
honor,
is
not
possible
in
this
regard.
the
school
district
compels
these
students
to
come
to
school.
the
school
district
enforces
the
state
requirements
that
they
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
two
things
are
satisfied.
as
in
this
case,
the
school
system
admits
that
these
students
are
effectively
excluded
from
any
educational
opportunities
and
we
argue
that
our
case
may
also
be
different
from
the
one
your
honor's
thinking
because
the
individuals
here
are
members
of
an
identifiable
national
origin
ethnic
group,
a
group
which
this
court
has
judicially
given
suspect
class.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that
maybe
so
on
the
facts,
but
i
don’t
--
my
understanding
of
the
case
is
that
not
every
member
of
a
suspect
class,
if
i
can
use
that
terminology,
must
be
discriminated
again
before
this
court
will
give
a
special
protection.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
your
honor
assumes
that
the
situation
comparing
the
portuguese
children
the
same
as
in
this
case,
where
the
school
system
admits
that
they
can
receive
no
possible
educational
benefits,
use
it
for
exclusion,
then
i
think,
the
school
district
would
have
an
obligation
to
do
something.
the
issue
which
we
are
concerned
with
naturally
in
court
is,
what
should
be
the
relief
be?
what
maybe
reasonable
in
san
francisco
to
do
with
1,800
children
may
not
be
reasonable
in
a
given
community
with
five
portuguese.
one
of
the
problems
was
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
no,
i
am
speaking
to
relief
that
teaching
the
five
portuguese
that
it
might
be
the
type
of
relief
that
they
might
just
be
able
to
use
cassettes,
that
they
might
just
be
able
to
use
some
flexible
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
oh,
no,
i
am
saying
that
if
they
are
effectively
excluded,
these
portuguese
students
would
have
--
i
would
assume
they
are
members
of
a
national
origin.
you
know,
if
you
are
assuming
that
they
are
members
of
the
national
origin-minority
group
as
petitioners
are
that
they
would
have
a
right
to
have
the
school
system
do
something
for
them,
if
the
school
system
was
admitting
that
currently,
they
are
effectively
excluded.
what
the
school
system
does
of
course
is
something
within
their
own
expertise.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
but
how
that
is
done?
there
are
myriad
of
methods
which
can
be
employed.
one
of
the
problems
that
has
been
raised
in
the
court
is
that
when
you
speak
of
five
portuguese
children,
it
seems
to
raise
spectrum,
they
have
to
have
someone
the
community
speak
portuguese
and
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
there
are
mostly
different
methods
to
employ.
what
i
am
saying
that
what
may
be
reasonable
--
what
methods
maybe
reasonable
for
dealing
with
five
portuguese
children
may
not
be
the
same
thing
that
san
francisco
might
do
with
its
1,800.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
mean
that
there
was
the
effective
exclusion
which
of
course
to
the
factual
question
which
has
to
be
dealt
within
the
case.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
the
government
is
going
to
have
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
the
answer
is
yes,
that
we
have
a
system
of
education.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
but
again
we
are
assuming
that
the
one
russian
student
in
a
given
community.
his
knowledge
of
english
is
so
little
that
he
receives
no
educational
benefits,
i
contend
your
honor
that
that
is
a
fact
situation
that
may
not
be
true.
in
this
case,
we
have
the
school
system
admitting
that
these
students
are
“inevitably
doomed
to
be
dropouts
and
become
another
unemployable
in
the
ghetto,”
that
appears
in
the
school
district
publication
at
pages
103
to
104
of
the
appendix.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
we
are
contending
that
our
students
unlike
the
deaf
child
are
not
primarily
handicap.
our
students
do
not
have
a
handicap,
but
they
have
the
capacity
and
the
ability
like
other
students
to
receive
education
opportunities,
what
they
need
is
a
very
short-term
effort.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
am
very
much
concerned.
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
its
case
and
that’s
why
our
students
come
from
a
suspect
class
whereas
i
don’t
believe
that
children
who
are
deaf
are
apparently
members
of
the
suspect
class
in
the
way
this
court
has
framed
it,
race
and
as
to
origin
etcetera.
if
the
deaf
child
is
effectively
excluded,
then
of
course
you
would
have
the
issue
of
then
whether
or
not
that
effective
exclusion
would
guarantee
him
to
constitutional
rights.
i
think
that
our
case
is
different
because
we
do
not
have
children
who
is,
if
you
want
to
use
the
word
handicap
as
permanent.
they,
like
other
children
have
the
innate
ability
and
capacity
to
learn.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that
sort
of
a
question
which
i
think
this
court
would
have
to
answer
after
rodriguez.
whether
the
court
in
rodriguez
framed
it
as
a
minimum
basic
education,
adequate
education
and
whether
that
is
one
compared
to
others
or
would
that
would
exist
of
the
school
system
ended
tomorrow.
i
am
hoping
that
this
court
would
never
have
to
reach
an
issue
like
that.
the
problem
here
is
one
of
the
equal
treatments.
these
are
the
students
who
are
getting
educational
benefits
in
a
compulsory
setting.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
it
was
raised
in
the
district
court
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
sixth
cause
--
the
fifth
or
sixth
cause
of
action
addresses
itself
to
that.
the
memorandum
or
the
guidelines
were
issued
at
the
press
release
inserted
guidelines,
came
down
a
day
before
the
lower
court
made
a
decision,
but
naturally
all
the
[voice
overlap]
regulations
before
that
time
on
which
the
guidelines
were
based.
regulations
go
into
national
ordnance
who
--
discrimination
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
have
been
in
existence.
the
court
was
made
aware
of
the
hew
guidelines
on
may
25
and
issued
a
decision
the
next
day.
so
i
have
it
with
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
hope
i
could
address
the
question
as
mr.
will
pottinger
address
himself
to.
i
think
that
the
language
is
precise
in
the
sense
that
congress
is
concerned
that
programs
receiving
federal
funds,
there
would
be
no
basis,
there’ll
be
no
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
national
origin.
one
of
the
inherent
components
of
national
origin
would
be
language
discrimination
and
the
regulations
which
came
down
even
before
this
lawsuit
was
brought
were
issued
pursuant
to
that
mandate
and
the
guidelines
which
came
down
the
day
before
the
lower
court
order
was
issued
extend
further
than
that.
i
would
hope
that
mr.
pottinger
would
answer
more
fully
questions
in
his
address
later,
unless
your
honors
wish
to
pursue
it
now.
as
we
have
indicated,
the
overall
result
in
this
case
is
in
effective
exclusion
of
petitioners
from
educational
benefits,
opportunity
to
receive
educational
benefits.
contrast
this
with
the
situation
confronting
this
court
in
rodriguez.
in
rodriguez
this
court
said,
this
is
at
93
supreme
court
pages
1291,
1299,
“texas'
financing
system
provides
at
least
an
adequate
program
of
education
for
every
child
in
every
school
district.
no
charge
fairly
could
be
made
that
the
financing
system
failed
to
provide
each
child
with
an
opportunity
to
acquire
basic
minimal
skills.”
that
is
the
very
charge
that
we
are
making
here
and
as
the
record
shows,
the
respondents
have
admitted
this.
this
court
has
always
been
concerned
with
looking
beyond,
if
you
will,
“surface
equality.”
the
ninth
circuit
was
satisfied
as
was
the
lower
court
that
“surface
equality”
satisfied
the
equal
protection
clause
giving
everybody
the
same
thing
even
though
some
cannot
benefit
from
it.
this
court
has
always
shown,
cases
even
decided
before
brown
versus
board
of
education
and
the
education,
in
sweatt
versus
painter,
mclaurin
versus
oklahoma
board
of
regents,
that
there
is
something
to
education
that
education
is
the
essence,
if
you
will,
is
communication,
the
interplay
of
ideas
and
ability
to
discuss.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
20
years
ago,
made
i
feel
a
very
cute
observation
in
the
dennis
versus
united
states
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
when
he
said
“there
is
no
greater
inequality
than
the
equal
treatment
of
unequals.”
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
is
ignoring
the
truth
of
this
observation
by
failing
to
recognize
that
education
is
not
solely
a
matter
of
physical
presence
in
a
classroom.
that
although
the
1,800
petitioners
and
all
other
students
in
san
francisco
do
receive
the
same
materials,
the
pages
are
blank
for
these
petitioners,
the
print
conveys
nothing,
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
court
was
contrasted
if
you
will
in
rodriguez.
when
at
least
in
rodriguez
the
students
were
provided
a
minimum
amount
of
education
that
every
student
was
given
--
acquired,
an
opportunity
to
acquire
basic
minimal
skills.
once
we
have
this
discrimination,
the
next
question
i
believe
this
court
must
face
is
how
to
evaluate
it.
and
since
1886,
when
the
supreme
court
decided
the
case
of
yick
wo
versus
hopkins.
this
court
has
historically
given
close
scrutiny
and
special
protection
to
chinese
individuals
like
petitioners.
in
fact,
last
term
in
rodriguez
this
court,
through
mr.
justice
powell's
decision,
stated
the
three
indicia
of
what
constitutes
a
suspect
class,
it
is
at
93
supreme
court
page
1294.
now
i
would
like
to
just
repeat
them
to
show
you
how
clearly
the
petitioners
in
this
case
fall
within
those
indicia.
“saddled
with
historical
disabilities,
relegated
to
a
position
of
political
powerlessness,
subjected
to
a
history
of
purpose
on
equal
treatment,
this
court
has
always
recognized
this
concerning
chinese
individuals.
in
fact
in
a
case
40
years
after,
yick
wo,
yu
cung
eng
versus
trinidad
in
1926
supreme
court
case.
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
recognized
discrimination
to
chinese-speaking
individuals,
not
just
chinese
people.
moreover,
your
honor
even
if
this
court
could
use
the
more
differential
rational
relationship
test,
the
respondents
have
offered
no
reasons
to
even
satisfy
that
test.
unfortunately,
they
have
offered
no
reasons
to
satisfy
any
test
and
we
submit
that
the
discrimination
and
the
absence
of
any
type
of
justification
for
it
must
leave
this
court
define
for
the
petitioners
and
order
the
respondents
to
develop
plans
within
their
own
expertise
which
would
overcome
the
deprivations
this
petitioners
suffer
and
provide
them
opportunities
to
learn.
my
20
minutes
are
up
your
honor.
mr.
pottinger
will
now
speak.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
that
what
has
been
happening,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
is
focusing
only
one
possible
method,
that
would
be
a
bilingual
method
where
the
teacher
speaks
chinese
as
well
as
english.
in
san
francisco
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
--
method
most
commonly
employed
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
it’s
a
problem
which
the
city
has
never
alluded
to.
i
don’t
really
know
about
particular
dialect.
in
san
francisco,
most
of
the
chinese-speaking
students
who
are
receiving
help
not
included
within
the
1,800
petitioners
are
receiving
the
help
in
a
method
called
english
as
the
second
language
in
which
the
teacher
does
not
speak
chinese.
in
which
the
teacher
employs
special
methods,
it
is
almost
like
a
lips
type
of
approach,
the
teacher
employs
special
methods.
the
point
that
we
are
raising
is
that
what
method
to
utilize
a
decision
for
the
school
system.
the
problem
that
the
1,800
students
face
is
that
today
they
are
receiving
nothing,
just
regular
instruction.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
comment
about
whether
or
not
there
is
any
record
concerning
this
is
a
problem
of
recent
origin,
let
me
just
cite
that,
at
page
45
of
the
appendix,
the
respondents
admitted
in
november
of
1967,
seven
months
before
the
immigration
relaxation
came
about,
and
again
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
numbers
have
been
increased
because
of
immigration
relaxation,
but
seven
months
before
the
immigration
code
has
even
came
in
to
effect,
the
respondents
submitted
19
--
pardon
me,
1,982
non-english-chinese
speaking
students
were
in
san
francisco
public
schools
needing
special
instruction,
not
understanding
the
language
of
instruction
and
getting
nothing.
and
what
--
my
point
is
that
the
school
system
has
long
known,
the
record
shows
that
it
is
as
far
back
as
1949,
the
school
system
made
statements
on
this,
again
it’s
in
the
appendix,
the
school
system
knows
if
these
students
don’t
know
english.
the
school
system
admits
and
knows
that
they
cannot
learn
english
sitting
and
languishing
in
their
regular
classrooms.
the
school
system
concedes
the
harsh
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that
is
something
which
is
debatable,
your
honor.
the
school
system
has
never
even
said
that
the
students
will
learn
to
use
mr.
o’conner’s
words,
by
immersion.
there
is
no
contention
by
the
school
system
that
if
they
sit
in
this
classes
they
will
learn.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
those
getting
the
special
help,
yes.
we
are
not
disputing
what
the
method
that
could
be
used.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
am
not
an
educator.
my
understanding
is
that
they
do
succeed.
our
point
is
that
we
want
the
school
system
to
use
some
method
because
right
now
mr.
justice
white,
the
school
system
admits
that
if
no
method
is
employed
these
students
are
“inevitably
be
going
to
be
dropouts.”
now
we
contend
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well
i
am
citing
the
appending
pages
103
to
104,
mr.
o’conner
as
i
believe
are
making
statements
that
are
not
reflected
by
the
record.
the
school
system
has
admitted
even
before
this
lawsuit
was
brought
that
these
students
cannot
learn,
that
they
are
inevitably
doomed,
that
they
are
frustrated
by
their
inability
to
understand
the
regular
word,
that
is
a
quote
that
appears
at
the
appendix
page
101.
our
contention
is
that
this
system
is
just
totally
irrational.
that
a
school
system
which
states
that
its
purpose
is
to
provide
education
opportunities,
which
states
that
its
purpose
is
they
have
student
develop
a
mastery
of
english,
provides
1,800
students,
a
program
which
guarantees
that
they
will
not
learn
this.
mr.
o’conner
says
today
the
situation
as
such
that
1,445
students
are
affected.
i
am
not
going
to
get
into
that
type
of
issue.
if
the
court
wants
further
data
in
the
current
situation
i
will
be
glad
to
provide
it.
my
understanding
is
even
more,
but
even
today,
the
court
concedes
there
are
--
the
respondents
concede
that
there
are
close
to
1,450
students,
who
languish
in
classes
and
do
not
even
get
the
type
of
education
which
the
respondents
and
their
publications
of
course
state
is
their
goal.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
my
understanding
is
that
--
i
just
checked
with
mr.
pottinger
that
this
--
the
school
system
at
the
end
of
a
given
contract
year
can
refuse
to,
you
know,
can
say
we
don’t
wish
to
participate
anymore.
the
problem
that
we
face
and
clearly
in
this
court,
we
are
claiming
it
as
a
statutory
violation.
the
problem
that
we
are
facing
is
that
they
are
obviously
federal
funds
can
be
pulled
out
that
mr.
o’conner
alluded
to.
obviously,
san
francisco
can
choose
not
to
go
into
a
federal
program
and
then
what
happens
to
these
students.
as
we’ve
said,
we
think
that
the
respondents
own
stated
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
mr.
pottinger
agrees
with
the
interpretation.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that’s
right
and
as
mr.
o’conner
said
he
does
not
know
what
they
would
do.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
your
honor,
i’m
just
saying
that
the
possible
problems
in
the
future
which
the
court
if
it
does
not
wish
to
address
now,
need
not.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
that
is
the
court’s
wishes
naturally.
well,
we
are
asserting
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
my
understanding
that
in
some
cases,
especially
cases
where
you
have
national
origin
type
of
problems,
race
problems,
some
of
this
segregation
cases
that
this
court
when
faced
with
a
combined
statutory,
constitution
argument
has
chose
not
to.
naturally
this
is
something
for
the
court
to
decide.
we
are
dealing
with
the
national
origin
group.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
my
understanding
that
some
of
the
segregation
case
was
raised
in
the
late
60’s
involved
both
complaints
under
civil
rights
act
as
well
as
constitutional.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
cannot
give
you
one.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
would
guess
that
would
be
true.
i
think
there
is
one
other
point
that
when
you
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
no,
i
don’t
know
off-hand.
i
know
that
san
francisco
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
yes.
and
san
francisco
is
receiving
large
sums
of
money
for
the
programs
that
it
is
now
operating.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
the
$2
million
is
for
all
non-english-speaking
students
in
san
francisco.
the
chinese
it
is
--
for
the
petitioner,
the
chinese
speaking
people
it’s
much
less.
one
thing
which
i
think
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of
is
that
right
now
or
currently,
based
on
the
facts
in
the
record
from
1970,
the
school
system
in
san
francisco
is
spending
an
average
of
$1,300.00
per
child.
the
figure
is
now
close
to
$2,000.00
per
child
and
for
1,800
students
right
now,
this
money
is
being
wasted.
san
francisco
is
spending
money
on
these
petitioners.
we
are
not
denying
that.
they
are
spending
money
to
put
them
in
regular
classrooms.
they
have
a
teacher
to
be
paid,
etcetera
and
right
now,
the
school
system
is
wasting
millions
of
dollars
and
this
is
one
of
the
responses
that
we
have
in
that
it’s
not
a
medical
school
system,suddenly
going
to
have
to
come
up
with
all
this
money,
but
they
are
now
spending
moneys
from
which
students
are
receiving
no
types
of
benefits.
mr.
pottinger
has
given
me
a
figure,
your
honor
that
currently
i
guess
this
is
all
title
--
all
moneys
under
hew
for
san
francisco
schools
is
$11
million
in
san
francisco.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
the
school
system
feels,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
most
effective
way
for
these
children
to
gain
a
master
of
english
is
to
teach
them
only
in
chinese
then
i
would
have
--
i
would
abide
by
the
decision.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
no
program
further
that
i
know
of
which
immerses
the
child
only
in
his
own
language
to
learn
another
language.
the
bilingual
program
uses
both
languages,
the
teacher
has
the
facility
in
both
languages.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
so
long
as
the
children
would
not
be
effectively
excluded
from
having
understanding
the
instructions
given
in
other
courses,
my
constitutional
grievance
i
think
might
be
settled.
now
if
their
entire
program,
it
was
going
to
be
in
chinese
for
12
years,
that
is
something
else
because
california
says
that
it
could
not
be
under
california
laws.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
they
were
just
taught
chinese
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
would
think
that
they
would
then
probably
have
a
constitutional
grievance
if
they
wished
to
be
taught
what
other
students
in
california
are
being
taught,
that
is
in
the
language
--
english
language
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
believe
what
you
are
alluding
to
sir
is
bilingual
programs
where
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
pardon
me
then,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
the
alternative
answers
would
be
within
the
methods
and
programs
devised
by
the
school
system.
all
we
want
the
school
system
to
do
is
provide
programs
which
would
meet
the,
right
now,
effective
exclusion.
if
the
school
system
chooses
that
type
of
program
and
it
turns
out
to
be
effective,
then
we
will
not
complain.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
choose
one
method
over
another.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
it
would
be
and
i
think
that
is
where
the
bilingual
program,
the
english
aspect
is
utilized.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
devote
the
20
minutes
of
my
opening
argument
to
the
constitutional
issues
raised
in
this
case.
i
would
then
be
followed
by
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger,
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
united
states
who
will
address
himself
to
the
statutory
violation
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
a
discrimination
suffered
by
nearly
1,800
non-english-speaking
chinese
students
in
san
francisco
in
the
provision
of
educational
benefits
and
opportunities.
both
the
federal
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
were
satisfied
that
so
long
as
the
san
francisco
school
system
provides
the
same
instruction,
the
same
materials,
the
same
teachers
to
all
students,
then
equal
protection
clause
is
satisfied,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
these
students
since
they
do
not
understand
english
and
since
they
are
sitting
in
classes
where
english
is
the
instruction
which
is
the
language
of
instruction,
regardless
the
fact
that
these
students
cannot
learn.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
they
are
both
chinese-americans,
they
are
both
native-born
and
they
are
also
foreign-born,
your
honor.
the
school
system
(inaudible)
interrogatories
said
that
it
does
not
keep
records
on
the
origin
of
birth
or
on
citizenship
of
the
students,
but
of
the
seven
named
petitioners
before
this
court;
five
of
them
are
native-born
american
citizens.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
yes,
five
of
them,
david
leung,
david
san,
judy
san,
karen
lee,
karen
yee
and
john
yee
(ph).
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
oh
definitely!
i
think
it’s
clear
that
many
members
of
the
1,800
students
that
we
represent
are
recent
immigrants.
i
think
though
that
one
thing
must
be
pointed
out
which
was
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief
of
petitioners
that
the
immigration
laws
were
relaxed
in
the
mid
60’s
and
the
new
laws
went
into
effect
on
july
1,
1968.
yet
the
defendants
in
their
own
survey
conducted
in
november
of
1967,
seven
months
before
the
new
immigration
laws
even
went
into
effect,
admitted
that
they
were
close
to
2,000
non-english
speaking
chinese
students
who
as
the
petitioners
are
before
you
effectively
excluded
from
education.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
in
the
school
population
of
san
francisco,
in
the
record
of
the
case,
there
are
approximately,
one
figure
as
13,000
from
the
city
attorney,
one
figure
as
15,000
from
the
school
district.
there
are
also
3,000
chinese-speaking
students
in
san
francisco
of
which
the
petitioners
represent
approximately
63%
of
those.
the
petitioners
represent
those
chinese-speaking
students,
your
honor,
who
received
nothing
except
the
regular
instruction
in
english.
in
the
lower
court
below,
there
was
another
class,
a
group
of
petitioners
who
were
non-english
speaking
chinese
students
who
did
receive
some
special
help.
those
petitioners
are
not
before
this
court.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
the
total
number
of
chinese
students
within
the
san
francisco
school
system.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
probably
between
10%
and
15%,
depending
on
which
figure
it
is.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
don’t
think
that
it
can
--
based
on
the
facts
in
the
case
your
honor
although
the
school
system
does
not
break
it
down.
as
i
said,
seven
months
before
the
immigration
laws
even
went
into
affect,
the
school
system
admitted
that
there
were
nearly
2,000
non-english-speaking
chinese
students
who
received
nothing.
the
november
1967
survey
admitted
there
were
approximately
2,400
non-english-speaking
chinese
students
within
the
entire
school
district.
and
of
those
2,400
merely
2,000
were
in
the
same
type
of
dilemma
according
to
petitioners.
they
don’t
speak
english,
they
don’t
understand
english
and
yet
their
entire
instructional
program
is
in
regular
classes
where
english
is
the
language
of
the
instruction.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
why
they
don’t
speak
english,
of
course,
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
think
that
these
court
can
take
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
the
chinese
community
in
san
francisco
is
what
we
refer
to
as
a
ghetto.
it’s
quite
insular
and
when
the
students
who
are
born
in
this
country,
come
to
the
schools,
they
do
not
have
the
facilities
in
english
and
unfortunately
the
actions
of
the
school
system
perpetuate
that
inability
to
speak
english.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
don’t
know
the
facts
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
don’t
know,
i
don’t
think
we
can
speak
in
terms
of
those,
but
i
think
we
can
speak
in
terms
of
the
1,800
students,
a
vast
percentage
or
native-born
americans
who
have
lived
their
entire
lives
in
san
francisco,
and
have
come
into
the
school
system
speaking
no
english.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well
again,
i
cannot
address
that
because
it
is
not
in
the
record.
all
i
can
rely
on
the
fact
that
in
1967,
the
school
system
admitted
even
before
the
immigration
laws
were
changed
that
there
would
2,000
students
in
the
school
system
right
then
who
were
chinese-speaking
who
do
not
speak
english
and
this
was
before
the
immigration
laws
were
even
changed.
so
that
is
all
i
can
surmise
for
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
oh
no!
our
goal
is
the
same
announced
goal
that
the
school
system
in
the
state
of
california
has
made.
our
goal
is
that
we
want
these
students
to
be
taught
english
and
to
understand
english,
so
they
can
have
the
type
of
mastered
english
which
our
society
requires.
the
problem
now
is
that
they
are
being
taught
in
a
language
they
do
not
understand.
and
we
would
like
the
school
system
to
do
is
to
take
whatever
steps
are
reasonable
and
this
of
course
is
within
their
province
since
they
are
the
experts
in
this
area,
to
take
whatever
steps
that
are
reasonable
to
guarantee
that
these
students
are
able
to
benefit
with
the
instruction
they
are
given.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
the
school
system
decided
that
teaching
them
in
chinese
was
the
most
effective
method
that
would
be
a
bilingual
method,
your
honor.
the
school
system
decided
that
teaching
them
in
chinese
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
so
long
as
they
would
be
able
to
understand
the
language
of
the
instruction
which
they’re
getting
throughout
the
school
system.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
under
the
state
--
under
the
law
of
state
of
california,
the
school
system
must
primarily
teach
them
in
english.
so
if
the
school
system
will
not
teach
them
totally
in
chinese,
the
school
system
might
wish
to
employ
chinese-speaking
teachers
in
a
bilingual
setting,
that
is
their
choice.
our
complaint
is
not
with
methodology.
we’re
not
asking
this
court
to
get
involved
in
petty
illogical
questions.
our
complaint
is
that
right
now,
the
school
system
is
utilizing
no
methods
based
on
their
own
admissions
if
i
can
refer
the
court
to
the
appendix.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
again
the
school
system
has
not
broken
down
the
place
from
which
the
chinese
students
come.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
i
can
just
cite
to
the
fact
that
there
are
san
francisco
schools
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
brought,
either
13,000
or
15,000
chinese
students
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
we’re
complaining
of
the
1,800
who
were
non-english
speaking
chinese
students.
i
guess
the
court
--
there
are
different
classes
the
court
can
look
at.
in
our
brief,
what
we
have
done
is
we
have
said
that
in
san
francisco
there
are
approximately
90,000
students
who
are
given
instructions
from
which
they
can
receive
educational
benefits
and
opportunities
whereas
there
are
1,800
students
who
are
foreclosed
from
receiving
any
opportunity.
in
essence
it’s
effect
of
exclusion.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
cannot
tell
you
why
these
1,800
came
to
school
and
not
knowing
english
and
other
chinese
students
do.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
oh,
i
think
we
have
because
i
think
we
have
shown
that
the
school
system
has
admitted
that
these
1,800
students
receive
today
no
educational
opportunities.
if
i
my
quote
the
record
at
page
56
of
the
appendix,
the
school
system
says
these
students
“must
learn
english
to
function
in
a
regular
classroom.”
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well
the
school
district,
your
honor,
is
not
possible
in
this
regard.
the
school
district
compels
these
students
to
come
to
school.
the
school
district
enforces
the
state
requirements
that
they
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
two
things
are
satisfied.
as
in
this
case,
the
school
system
admits
that
these
students
are
effectively
excluded
from
any
educational
opportunities
and
we
argue
that
our
case
may
also
be
different
from
the
one
your
honor's
thinking
because
the
individuals
here
are
members
of
an
identifiable
national
origin
ethnic
group,
a
group
which
this
court
has
judicially
given
suspect
class.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that
maybe
so
on
the
facts,
but
i
don’t
--
my
understanding
of
the
case
is
that
not
every
member
of
a
suspect
class,
if
i
can
use
that
terminology,
must
be
discriminated
again
before
this
court
will
give
a
special
protection.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
your
honor
assumes
that
the
situation
comparing
the
portuguese
children
the
same
as
in
this
case,
where
the
school
system
admits
that
they
can
receive
no
possible
educational
benefits,
use
it
for
exclusion,
then
i
think,
the
school
district
would
have
an
obligation
to
do
something.
the
issue
which
we
are
concerned
with
naturally
in
court
is,
what
should
be
the
relief
be?
what
maybe
reasonable
in
san
francisco
to
do
with
1,800
children
may
not
be
reasonable
in
a
given
community
with
five
portuguese.
one
of
the
problems
was
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
no,
i
am
speaking
to
relief
that
teaching
the
five
portuguese
that
it
might
be
the
type
of
relief
that
they
might
just
be
able
to
use
cassettes,
that
they
might
just
be
able
to
use
some
flexible
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
oh,
no,
i
am
saying
that
if
they
are
effectively
excluded,
these
portuguese
students
would
have
--
i
would
assume
they
are
members
of
a
national
origin.
you
know,
if
you
are
assuming
that
they
are
members
of
the
national
origin-minority
group
as
petitioners
are
that
they
would
have
a
right
to
have
the
school
system
do
something
for
them,
if
the
school
system
was
admitting
that
currently,
they
are
effectively
excluded.
what
the
school
system
does
of
course
is
something
within
their
own
expertise.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
but
how
that
is
done?
there
are
myriad
of
methods
which
can
be
employed.
one
of
the
problems
that
has
been
raised
in
the
court
is
that
when
you
speak
of
five
portuguese
children,
it
seems
to
raise
spectrum,
they
have
to
have
someone
the
community
speak
portuguese
and
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
there
are
mostly
different
methods
to
employ.
what
i
am
saying
that
what
may
be
reasonable
--
what
methods
maybe
reasonable
for
dealing
with
five
portuguese
children
may
not
be
the
same
thing
that
san
francisco
might
do
with
its
1,800.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
mean
that
there
was
the
effective
exclusion
which
of
course
to
the
factual
question
which
has
to
be
dealt
within
the
case.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
the
government
is
going
to
have
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
the
answer
is
yes,
that
we
have
a
system
of
education.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
but
again
we
are
assuming
that
the
one
russian
student
in
a
given
community.
his
knowledge
of
english
is
so
little
that
he
receives
no
educational
benefits,
i
contend
your
honor
that
that
is
a
fact
situation
that
may
not
be
true.
in
this
case,
we
have
the
school
system
admitting
that
these
students
are
“inevitably
doomed
to
be
dropouts
and
become
another
unemployable
in
the
ghetto,”
that
appears
in
the
school
district
publication
at
pages
103
to
104
of
the
appendix.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
we
are
contending
that
our
students
unlike
the
deaf
child
are
not
primarily
handicap.
our
students
do
not
have
a
handicap,
but
they
have
the
capacity
and
the
ability
like
other
students
to
receive
education
opportunities,
what
they
need
is
a
very
short-term
effort.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
am
very
much
concerned.
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
its
case
and
that’s
why
our
students
come
from
a
suspect
class
whereas
i
don’t
believe
that
children
who
are
deaf
are
apparently
members
of
the
suspect
class
in
the
way
this
court
has
framed
it,
race
and
as
to
origin
etcetera.
if
the
deaf
child
is
effectively
excluded,
then
of
course
you
would
have
the
issue
of
then
whether
or
not
that
effective
exclusion
would
guarantee
him
to
constitutional
rights.
i
think
that
our
case
is
different
because
we
do
not
have
children
who
is,
if
you
want
to
use
the
word
handicap
as
permanent.
they,
like
other
children
have
the
innate
ability
and
capacity
to
learn.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that
sort
of
a
question
which
i
think
this
court
would
have
to
answer
after
rodriguez.
whether
the
court
in
rodriguez
framed
it
as
a
minimum
basic
education,
adequate
education
and
whether
that
is
one
compared
to
others
or
would
that
would
exist
of
the
school
system
ended
tomorrow.
i
am
hoping
that
this
court
would
never
have
to
reach
an
issue
like
that.
the
problem
here
is
one
of
the
equal
treatments.
these
are
the
students
who
are
getting
educational
benefits
in
a
compulsory
setting.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
it
was
raised
in
the
district
court
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
sixth
cause
--
the
fifth
or
sixth
cause
of
action
addresses
itself
to
that.
the
memorandum
or
the
guidelines
were
issued
at
the
press
release
inserted
guidelines,
came
down
a
day
before
the
lower
court
made
a
decision,
but
naturally
all
the
[voice
overlap]
regulations
before
that
time
on
which
the
guidelines
were
based.
regulations
go
into
national
ordnance
who
--
discrimination
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
have
been
in
existence.
the
court
was
made
aware
of
the
hew
guidelines
on
may
25
and
issued
a
decision
the
next
day.
so
i
have
it
with
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
i
hope
i
could
address
the
question
as
mr.
will
pottinger
address
himself
to.
i
think
that
the
language
is
precise
in
the
sense
that
congress
is
concerned
that
programs
receiving
federal
funds,
there
would
be
no
basis,
there’ll
be
no
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
national
origin.
one
of
the
inherent
components
of
national
origin
would
be
language
discrimination
and
the
regulations
which
came
down
even
before
this
lawsuit
was
brought
were
issued
pursuant
to
that
mandate
and
the
guidelines
which
came
down
the
day
before
the
lower
court
order
was
issued
extend
further
than
that.
i
would
hope
that
mr.
pottinger
would
answer
more
fully
questions
in
his
address
later,
unless
your
honors
wish
to
pursue
it
now.
as
we
have
indicated,
the
overall
result
in
this
case
is
in
effective
exclusion
of
petitioners
from
educational
benefits,
opportunity
to
receive
educational
benefits.
contrast
this
with
the
situation
confronting
this
court
in
rodriguez.
in
rodriguez
this
court
said,
this
is
at
93
supreme
court
pages
1291,
1299,
“texas'
financing
system
provides
at
least
an
adequate
program
of
education
for
every
child
in
every
school
district.
no
charge
fairly
could
be
made
that
the
financing
system
failed
to
provide
each
child
with
an
opportunity
to
acquire
basic
minimal
skills.”
that
is
the
very
charge
that
we
are
making
here
and
as
the
record
shows,
the
respondents
have
admitted
this.
this
court
has
always
been
concerned
with
looking
beyond,
if
you
will,
“surface
equality.”
the
ninth
circuit
was
satisfied
as
was
the
lower
court
that
“surface
equality”
satisfied
the
equal
protection
clause
giving
everybody
the
same
thing
even
though
some
cannot
benefit
from
it.
this
court
has
always
shown,
cases
even
decided
before
brown
versus
board
of
education
and
the
education,
in
sweatt
versus
painter,
mclaurin
versus
oklahoma
board
of
regents,
that
there
is
something
to
education
that
education
is
the
essence,
if
you
will,
is
communication,
the
interplay
of
ideas
and
ability
to
discuss.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
20
years
ago,
made
i
feel
a
very
cute
observation
in
the
dennis
versus
united
states
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
when
he
said
“there
is
no
greater
inequality
than
the
equal
treatment
of
unequals.”
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
is
ignoring
the
truth
of
this
observation
by
failing
to
recognize
that
education
is
not
solely
a
matter
of
physical
presence
in
a
classroom.
that
although
the
1,800
petitioners
and
all
other
students
in
san
francisco
do
receive
the
same
materials,
the
pages
are
blank
for
these
petitioners,
the
print
conveys
nothing,
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
court
was
contrasted
if
you
will
in
rodriguez.
when
at
least
in
rodriguez
the
students
were
provided
a
minimum
amount
of
education
that
every
student
was
given
--
acquired,
an
opportunity
to
acquire
basic
minimal
skills.
once
we
have
this
discrimination,
the
next
question
i
believe
this
court
must
face
is
how
to
evaluate
it.
and
since
1886,
when
the
supreme
court
decided
the
case
of
yick
wo
versus
hopkins.
this
court
has
historically
given
close
scrutiny
and
special
protection
to
chinese
individuals
like
petitioners.
in
fact,
last
term
in
rodriguez
this
court,
through
mr.
justice
powell's
decision,
stated
the
three
indicia
of
what
constitutes
a
suspect
class,
it
is
at
93
supreme
court
page
1294.
now
i
would
like
to
just
repeat
them
to
show
you
how
clearly
the
petitioners
in
this
case
fall
within
those
indicia.
“saddled
with
historical
disabilities,
relegated
to
a
position
of
political
powerlessness,
subjected
to
a
history
of
purpose
on
equal
treatment,
this
court
has
always
recognized
this
concerning
chinese
individuals.
in
fact
in
a
case
40
years
after,
yick
wo,
yu
cung
eng
versus
trinidad
in
1926
supreme
court
case.
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
recognized
discrimination
to
chinese-speaking
individuals,
not
just
chinese
people.
moreover,
your
honor
even
if
this
court
could
use
the
more
differential
rational
relationship
test,
the
respondents
have
offered
no
reasons
to
even
satisfy
that
test.
unfortunately,
they
have
offered
no
reasons
to
satisfy
any
test
and
we
submit
that
the
discrimination
and
the
absence
of
any
type
of
justification
for
it
must
leave
this
court
define
for
the
petitioners
and
order
the
respondents
to
develop
plans
within
their
own
expertise
which
would
overcome
the
deprivations
this
petitioners
suffer
and
provide
them
opportunities
to
learn.
my
20
minutes
are
up
your
honor.
mr.
pottinger
will
now
speak.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
that
what
has
been
happening,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
is
focusing
only
one
possible
method,
that
would
be
a
bilingual
method
where
the
teacher
speaks
chinese
as
well
as
english.
in
san
francisco
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
--
method
most
commonly
employed
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
it’s
a
problem
which
the
city
has
never
alluded
to.
i
don’t
really
know
about
particular
dialect.
in
san
francisco,
most
of
the
chinese-speaking
students
who
are
receiving
help
not
included
within
the
1,800
petitioners
are
receiving
the
help
in
a
method
called
english
as
the
second
language
in
which
the
teacher
does
not
speak
chinese.
in
which
the
teacher
employs
special
methods,
it
is
almost
like
a
lips
type
of
approach,
the
teacher
employs
special
methods.
the
point
that
we
are
raising
is
that
what
method
to
utilize
a
decision
for
the
school
system.
the
problem
that
the
1,800
students
face
is
that
today
they
are
receiving
nothing,
just
regular
instruction.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
comment
about
whether
or
not
there
is
any
record
concerning
this
is
a
problem
of
recent
origin,
let
me
just
cite
that,
at
page
45
of
the
appendix,
the
respondents
admitted
in
november
of
1967,
seven
months
before
the
immigration
relaxation
came
about,
and
again
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
numbers
have
been
increased
because
of
immigration
relaxation,
but
seven
months
before
the
immigration
code
has
even
came
in
to
effect,
the
respondents
submitted
19
--
pardon
me,
1,982
non-english-chinese
speaking
students
were
in
san
francisco
public
schools
needing
special
instruction,
not
understanding
the
language
of
instruction
and
getting
nothing.
and
what
--
my
point
is
that
the
school
system
has
long
known,
the
record
shows
that
it
is
as
far
back
as
1949,
the
school
system
made
statements
on
this,
again
it’s
in
the
appendix,
the
school
system
knows
if
these
students
don’t
know
english.
the
school
system
admits
and
knows
that
they
cannot
learn
english
sitting
and
languishing
in
their
regular
classrooms.
the
school
system
concedes
the
harsh
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that
is
something
which
is
debatable,
your
honor.
the
school
system
has
never
even
said
that
the
students
will
learn
to
use
mr.
o’conner’s
words,
by
immersion.
there
is
no
contention
by
the
school
system
that
if
they
sit
in
this
classes
they
will
learn.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
those
getting
the
special
help,
yes.
we
are
not
disputing
what
the
method
that
could
be
used.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
am
not
an
educator.
my
understanding
is
that
they
do
succeed.
our
point
is
that
we
want
the
school
system
to
use
some
method
because
right
now
mr.
justice
white,
the
school
system
admits
that
if
no
method
is
employed
these
students
are
“inevitably
be
going
to
be
dropouts.”
now
we
contend
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well
i
am
citing
the
appending
pages
103
to
104,
mr.
o’conner
as
i
believe
are
making
statements
that
are
not
reflected
by
the
record.
the
school
system
has
admitted
even
before
this
lawsuit
was
brought
that
these
students
cannot
learn,
that
they
are
inevitably
doomed,
that
they
are
frustrated
by
their
inability
to
understand
the
regular
word,
that
is
a
quote
that
appears
at
the
appendix
page
101.
our
contention
is
that
this
system
is
just
totally
irrational.
that
a
school
system
which
states
that
its
purpose
is
to
provide
education
opportunities,
which
states
that
its
purpose
is
they
have
student
develop
a
mastery
of
english,
provides
1,800
students,
a
program
which
guarantees
that
they
will
not
learn
this.
mr.
o’conner
says
today
the
situation
as
such
that
1,445
students
are
affected.
i
am
not
going
to
get
into
that
type
of
issue.
if
the
court
wants
further
data
in
the
current
situation
i
will
be
glad
to
provide
it.
my
understanding
is
even
more,
but
even
today,
the
court
concedes
there
are
--
the
respondents
concede
that
there
are
close
to
1,450
students,
who
languish
in
classes
and
do
not
even
get
the
type
of
education
which
the
respondents
and
their
publications
of
course
state
is
their
goal.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
my
understanding
is
that
--
i
just
checked
with
mr.
pottinger
that
this
--
the
school
system
at
the
end
of
a
given
contract
year
can
refuse
to,
you
know,
can
say
we
don’t
wish
to
participate
anymore.
the
problem
that
we
face
and
clearly
in
this
court,
we
are
claiming
it
as
a
statutory
violation.
the
problem
that
we
are
facing
is
that
they
are
obviously
federal
funds
can
be
pulled
out
that
mr.
o’conner
alluded
to.
obviously,
san
francisco
can
choose
not
to
go
into
a
federal
program
and
then
what
happens
to
these
students.
as
we’ve
said,
we
think
that
the
respondents
own
stated
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
mr.
pottinger
agrees
with
the
interpretation.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
that’s
right
and
as
mr.
o’conner
said
he
does
not
know
what
they
would
do.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
your
honor,
i’m
just
saying
that
the
possible
problems
in
the
future
which
the
court
if
it
does
not
wish
to
address
now,
need
not.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
that
is
the
court’s
wishes
naturally.
well,
we
are
asserting
that
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
my
understanding
that
in
some
cases,
especially
cases
where
you
have
national
origin
type
of
problems,
race
problems,
some
of
this
segregation
cases
that
this
court
when
faced
with
a
combined
statutory,
constitution
argument
has
chose
not
to.
naturally
this
is
something
for
the
court
to
decide.
we
are
dealing
with
the
national
origin
group.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
my
understanding
that
some
of
the
segregation
case
was
raised
in
the
late
60’s
involved
both
complaints
under
civil
rights
act
as
well
as
constitutional.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
cannot
give
you
one.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
would
guess
that
would
be
true.
i
think
there
is
one
other
point
that
when
you
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
no,
i
don’t
know
off-hand.
i
know
that
san
francisco
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
yes.
and
san
francisco
is
receiving
large
sums
of
money
for
the
programs
that
it
is
now
operating.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
well,
the
$2
million
is
for
all
non-english-speaking
students
in
san
francisco.
the
chinese
it
is
--
for
the
petitioner,
the
chinese
speaking
people
it’s
much
less.
one
thing
which
i
think
that
the
court
should
be
aware
of
is
that
right
now
or
currently,
based
on
the
facts
in
the
record
from
1970,
the
school
system
in
san
francisco
is
spending
an
average
of
$1,300.00
per
child.
the
figure
is
now
close
to
$2,000.00
per
child
and
for
1,800
students
right
now,
this
money
is
being
wasted.
san
francisco
is
spending
money
on
these
petitioners.
we
are
not
denying
that.
they
are
spending
money
to
put
them
in
regular
classrooms.
they
have
a
teacher
to
be
paid,
etcetera
and
right
now,
the
school
system
is
wasting
millions
of
dollars
and
this
is
one
of
the
responses
that
we
have
in
that
it’s
not
a
medical
school
system,suddenly
going
to
have
to
come
up
with
all
this
money,
but
they
are
now
spending
moneys
from
which
students
are
receiving
no
types
of
benefits.
mr.
pottinger
has
given
me
a
figure,
your
honor
that
currently
i
guess
this
is
all
title
--
all
moneys
under
hew
for
san
francisco
schools
is
$11
million
in
san
francisco.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
the
school
system
feels,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
most
effective
way
for
these
children
to
gain
a
master
of
english
is
to
teach
them
only
in
chinese
then
i
would
have
--
i
would
abide
by
the
decision.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
no
program
further
that
i
know
of
which
immerses
the
child
only
in
his
own
language
to
learn
another
language.
the
bilingual
program
uses
both
languages,
the
teacher
has
the
facility
in
both
languages.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
so
long
as
the
children
would
not
be
effectively
excluded
from
having
understanding
the
instructions
given
in
other
courses,
my
constitutional
grievance
i
think
might
be
settled.
now
if
their
entire
program,
it
was
going
to
be
in
chinese
for
12
years,
that
is
something
else
because
california
says
that
it
could
not
be
under
california
laws.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
if
they
were
just
taught
chinese
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
would
think
that
they
would
then
probably
have
a
constitutional
grievance
if
they
wished
to
be
taught
what
other
students
in
california
are
being
taught,
that
is
in
the
language
--
english
language
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
believe
what
you
are
alluding
to
sir
is
bilingual
programs
where
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
pardon
me
then,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
the
alternative
answers
would
be
within
the
methods
and
programs
devised
by
the
school
system.
all
we
want
the
school
system
to
do
is
provide
programs
which
would
meet
the,
right
now,
effective
exclusion.
if
the
school
system
chooses
that
type
of
program
and
it
turns
out
to
be
effective,
then
we
will
not
complain.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
choose
one
method
over
another.
mr.
edward
h.
steinman
i
think
it
would
be
and
i
think
that
is
where
the
bilingual
program,
the
english
aspect
is
utilized.
thank
you
very
much.
