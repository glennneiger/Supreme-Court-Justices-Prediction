mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
representing
the
san
francisco
school
district
and
it
is
our
position
of
course
that
we
don’t
depreciate
or
challenge
any
particular
educational
aids
which
a
school
district
provides
including
the
one
to
provide
special
instruction
in
english
for
non-speaking
english
students.
and
in
fact,
contrary
to
statements
that
have
been
made,
the
san
francisco
school
district
which
operates
all
the
elementary,
junior
high
schools
and
high
schools
in
san
francisco
has
for
several
years
been
committed
to
a
policy
of
providing
this
special
language
instruction
not
only
to
chinese
students,
but
to
spanish
children
as
well
and
have
now
started
a
japanese
non-speaking
english
program
in
san
francisco.
and
in
the
years
1967
--
1966,
1967
the
program
for
the
chinese
school
children
was
started.
commencing
in
1967,
1968,
the
special
instruction
in
english
program
was
started
for
spanish-speaking
children.
and
commencing
a
1971,
1972,
a
separate
special
instruction
in
english
program
was
commenced
for
filipino
children
which
program
had
been
part
of
the
spanish-speaking
program
up
to
this
point
and
as
i
mentioned
a
special
program
for
japanese-speaking
children
was
started
this
year.
the
expenditures
on
this
program
arose
to
$2.37
million
in
1972,
1973.
for
the
chinese
program,
$1,196,550.00
was
spent
during
that
fiscal
year,
for
the
spanish
program,
$956,000.00
and
for
the
filipino
program
$222,000.00.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
this
case
i
think
is
a
case
which
says
that
the
school
board
in
san
francisco
must
supply
special
instruction
in
english
to
all
students
who
may
require
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
these
are
my
preliminary
statements
to
show
the
disposition
of
san
francisco
as
far
as
an
attitude
toward
instructing
its
children
in
--
who
do
not
speak
the
language.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
our
contention
is
that
contrary
to
what
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
stated,
say
they
are
the
group
who
has
not
been
reached
as
far
as
programs
are
concerned
and
that
san
francisco
under
the
equal
protection
clause
must
cover
every
child
with
a
non-english
speaking
problem.
it
is
our
contention
of
course
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause
this
is
not
so
that
the
school
district
has
not
the
constitutional
duty
to
provide
such
instruction.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
didn’t
mean
to
say
that
we
are
covering
the
program
entirely.
i
was
saying
that
the
attitude
and
the
direction
and
the
practice
of
san
francisco
is
to
import
as
much
of
this
type
of
program
as
it
can.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
in
1971
when
this
case
was
decided,
there
were
--
under
stipulation
of
facts
and
it
was
not
a
stipulation
that
the
children
as
stated
where
doomed,
that
they
did
not
get
education.
the
stipulation
was
that
1,800
needed
special
instruction
in
the
english
language,
chinese
children.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
and
there
where
2,856
students
in
the
school
district
with
who
are
non-english
speaking
chinese
children
and
of
that
the
number
1,800
received
no
special
instruction.
the
remaining
1,066
did
receive
special
instruction
in
chinese
in
three
programs.
one
was
the
chinese
center
program,
one
was
the
bilingual
program
which
was
funded
by
the
federal
government
and
the
third
was
the
esl
programming,
which
is
the
second
language
program,
which
the
rest
of
the
children
that
did
get.
and
the
california
bilingual
education
act
of
1972
called
upon
the
districts
in
california
to
specify
the
children
in
their
district
which
had
limited
english
speaking
ability
and
also
to
make
the
list
of
those
children
who
had
no
english
speaking
ability
and
pursuant
to
that
census
which
was
taken
by
the
classroom
teachers
in
san
francisco
in
april
of
this
year,
the
extent
of
the
problem
and
the
numbers
of
children
who
do
not
speak
english
or
have
a
limited
speaking
english
ability
at
the
present
time
or
in
april
of
this
year
are
as
follows.
there
are
9,000
children
who
have
either
limited
english
speaking
or
no
english
speaking
ability;
non-english
speaking,
1,180;
limited
english-speaking
7,904,
and
while
we
deal
only
with
the
chinese
children
in
this
case,
i
think
the
court
will
be
interested
in
the
statistics
as
far
as
the
other
groups
are
concerned.
the
spanish
total
both
of
non-speaking
and
limited
speaking,
2,980.
the
filipino
total,
including
both
1,395.
the
japanese
total,
202.
the
samoan
total,
179
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
and
i
haven’t
got
to
the
chinese
yet.
others
not
including
with
chinese,
747.
the
chinese
census
report
gives
a
total
of
3,457.
non-english
speaking,
436
and
they
broke
it
down
into
schools
of
the
436,
there
were
232
in
the
elementary
school,
138
in
the
junior
high
and
66
in
the
senior
high,
non-english
speaking;
limited
english
speaking
ability,
1,768.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
this
is
not
in
the
appendix
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
this
is
[voice
overlap]
compiled
in
the
statistics
of
the
school
board.
i
would
be
very
happy
if
i
may
to
supply
the
copy
of
the
statistics
as
part
of
the
record.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
i
have
supplied
i
believe
both
mr.
pottinger
and
mr.
steinman
with
this
report
and
the
chinese
program
today
shows
2,012
enrolled.
now
i
presented
these
statistics
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
there
are
13,037
chinese
children
in
the
school.
there
are
--
the
difference
between
3,457
and
2,012
that
do
not
speak
the
language
and
do
not
have
special
instruction
in
english.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
primarily
there
is
--
the
main
answer
is
that
san
francisco
would
attempt
to
cover
all
if
it
had
be
resources
with
which
to
do
it,
that
is
the
inclination
of
the
board
of
education.
however,
they
have
not
moved
up
on
the
complete
coverage
of
all
theses
children
because
of
the
other
requirements
of
the
budget.
i
think
that’s
the
answer
in
simple
form.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
of
course
if
required
under
the
constitution
to
do
so,
they
would,
but
there
is
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
that’s
my
point,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
great
purposes
of
the
country
education.
what
as
stated
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
rodriguez
case,
it
is
not
a
fundamental
right,
it
is
not
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
so
that
the
great
aim
and
problem
and
work
of
school
districts
and
states
in
the
educational
field
while
one
of
the
most
important
is
not
one
that
unless
every
facet
of
the
problem
is
covered
is
one
where
a
person
can
come
into
court
and
state
i
am
not
covered.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
was,
what
is
the
classification
between
the
chinese
students
who
do
receive
special
english
education
and
those
who
do
not?
the
classification
in
this
case
if
the
court
please
is
something
that
the
original
petitioners
have
made.
it
is
our
position
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
there
is
no
constitutional
duty
to
supply
any
of
the
non-english
chinese
students,
the
special
courses
in
the
english
language.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
these
are
--
as
far
as
education
is
concerned,
these
are
educational
policy
questions
when
they
don’t
rise
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
it’s
the
combination
of
things.
that
is
one
of
the
factors.
i
will
advert
to
what
has
been
talked
about.
the
immigration
problem
in
san
francisco,
it
is
the
increasing
number
of
non-english
chinese
speaking
students
that
are
coming
in.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
there
is
a
certain
limit
to
the
number
and
i
have
been
advised
that
they
are
taken
into
the
chinese
center
to
determine
their
ability,
but
because
there
aren’t
enough
teachers
and
enough
classes,
it’s
really
by
waiting
list.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
believe
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
that
is
part
of
the
problem
of
course,
especially
with
the
chinese
language
to
get
qualified
to
teachers.
but
of
course
again
with
the
unlimited
resources,
that’s
a
problem
that
could
be
surmounted.
i
say,
it
is
partly
a
question
of
resources
of
the
school
district
and
in
california
and
in
san
francisco
in
particular,
the
school
district
is
operating
to
the
limit
of
its
budget,
so
it
would
mean
an
reallocation
of
items
to
fully
staff
this
program,
and
of
course,
i
might
add
that
this
is
one
of
the
competing
special
educational
features
which
children
with
other
handicaps
require
attention
of
the
school
board
as
well.
this
--
it’s
been
mentioned
that
the
chinese
are
suspect
classification
and
there
has
been
a
long
history
of
discrimination
against
the
chinese.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
briefly
revert
or
speak
about
the
decision
in
guey
heung
lee
versus
david
johnson
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
denied
the
application
for
a
stay
after
a
denial
by
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i
want
to
state
that
this
is
not
--
was
not
a
petition
by
the
school
district
of
san
francisco.
it
was
a
petition
by
some
chinese
parents
who
did
not
wish
to
have
their
children
move
from
the
schools
in
chinatown
to
the
schools
that
were
provided
for
them
under
the
integration
order
in
the
case
that
the
city
and
county
school
district
was
involved
in,
that
is
johnson
against
the
san
francisco
board
of
education.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
douglas
and
that’s
what
i
wanted
to
talk
about.
you
mentioned
in
your
decision
and
correctly,
properly
and
rightly
so
that
under
the
education
code
of
california,
there
was
a
provision
not
repealed
until
1947
that
that
could
be
provided
for
chinese,
japanese
and
children
of
mongolian
origin,
separate
schools
and
if
separate
schools
were
provided,
these
children
could
not
attend
other
schools.
now,
i
can
speak
from
the
experience
now
of
50
years
and
research,
confirms
it
that
in
san
francisco,
there
has
not
been
a
separate
school
under
this
statute
as
far
as
any
children
of
san
francisco
are
concerned,
including
chinese
children.
and
it
is
a
fact
that
the
chinese
like
the
irish
and
italians
who
first
settled
around
the
chinatown
area
when
they
fanned
out
over
the
city
to
the
various
neighborhoods
and
went
to
the
neighborhood
schools,
the
chinese
children
did
so
as
well.
and
i
ran
across
which
i
think
the
court
might
be
interested
in,
a
recent
book
called
“longtime
california:
a
documentary
study
of
an
american
chinatown”
by
victor
and
barry
nee,
and
on
account
of
interview
with
lee-lun
chin
who
is
now
age
73
and
is
one
of
the
staff
of
the
young
china
daily,
stated
that
he
left
san
francisco
after
the
fire
and
earthquake
and
went
up
to
a
small
town
under
sacramento
river
and
when
his
father
found
that
he
couldn’t
attend
a
school
there,
he
returned
to
san
francisco
and
went
to
lower
high
school.
he
says,
“well
in
1910,
my
parents
sent
me
back
to
san
francisco
because
orientals
weren’t
allowed
in
the
schools
down
there.
i
was
going
to
a
lowell
high
school
and
there
i
met
some
young
chinese
students.”
at
lowell
high
school,
we’ve
mentioned
on
our
brief
was
then
and
is
now
the
academic
high
school
in
san
francisco
where
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
the
chinese
have
a
greater
percentage
in
that
school
than
their
citywide
percentages
for
high
school
students
as
the
academic
school
of
san
francisco
and
in
1910,
mr.
chin
went
there.
that
documents
of
course
what
i
know
to
be
the
fact
that
the
chinese
as
with
others
moved
out
into
the
schools
of
san
francisco.
and
to
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
they
are
children
who
attend
the
schools
in
chinatown
and
the
surrounding
area
as
well
as
other
districts
of
the
city
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
pardon?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
they
aren’t
taught
by
special
instruction
in
english.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
revert
and
i
think
to
the
statement
in
the
--
in
meyer
versus
nebraska,
which
of
course
is
the
leading
case
on
the
question
of
english
in
the
schools.
and
where
mr.
justice
holmes
dissented
from
the
opinion,
would
stated
that
the
best
thing
for
young
children
and
i
think
he
mentioned
poles
and
russians
who
have
no
english
in
their
homes
was
to
come
to
the
school
and
not
be
taught
in
german
as
primarily.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
so
that
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
they
are
being
taught
those
that
aren’t
covered
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
he
stated
and
i
want
to
follow
that
up
but
the
best
thing
for
a
child
who
can’t
speak
a
language
to
do
without
any
special
instruction
is
to
come
to
an
english-speaking
school.
and
i
think
common
experience
as
well
some
of
the
authorities,
although,
bilingual
or
special
courses
are
better.
[voice
overlap]
you
nevertheless
by
the
immersion
process,
a
child
learns
to
speak
and
especially
a
child
because
it
is
easier,
the
authority
say
for
child
to
learn
language
by
total
immersion
than
other
individuals.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no
formal
training
but
i
can’t
concur
in
that
entirely
i
think
any
child
who
comes
to
a
school
and
i
want
to
mention
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
you
would.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
--
it
is
rather
non-fact
question,
i
think
you
would
learn
anywhere,
but
i
think
that
being
immersed
in
that
atmosphere
where
nothing
is
spoken,
but
the
language
around
you,
from
a
child’s
viewpoint
the
authorities
tell
us.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
you
mean
to
teach?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
don’t
come
here
and
say
that
this
is
the
best
way.
i
think
it
is
the
least
effective
way
and
that
would
be
better
if
san
francisco
could
cover
all
of
its
children.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
that’s
i
say
it
is
yes.
little
effective,
not
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
because
the
program
as
yet
hasn’t
covered
them,
but
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
they
find
that
children
on
the
waiting
list,
i
have
been
told
is,
go
back
to
the
school
where
there
is
no
special
language
education.
and
by
the
time
they
get
back
to
number
one
on
the
waiting
list,
they
no
longer
have
a
need
for
the
special
education.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
believe
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
speaks
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
a
race,
minority,
national
origin.
no
chinese-speaking
child
is
discriminated
against
in
any
of
these
courses
is
--
has
the
same
education
as
others.
he
may
not
be
able
to
benefit
by
it
as
much,
but
it
is
not
up
to
the
hew
to
determine
what
effect
this
has.
i
think
if
it
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
it
has
the
authority,
but
until
it
is
declared
by
this
court
to
be
a
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
believe
not,
they
are
--
the
guidelines
adopted
in
1970
talks
for
effective
programs
for
non-english-speaking
children.
and
in
the
grants
which
san
francisco
has
for
instance
under
title
vii
of
the
education
act
for
bilingual
program,
this
is
not
only
a
program
which
hew
gives
the
funds
for
to
teach
this
particular
--
or
to
help
solve
this
particular
problem,
but
requires
that
on
the
basis
of
title
vi
that
there
be
no
discrimination
and
in
that
program,
children
of
other
national
origins
are
included.
the
other
program
as
mentioned
in
the
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
do
not.
the
program
under
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
except
that
i
think
this
record
shows
that
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
that
would
be
part
of
the
statute,
a
direct
statement
and
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
under
the
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no,
i
would
say
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
if
there
was
a
statute
specifically
directing
this,
yes,
i
would
say
so.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
except
i
think
there
is
a
further
point
whether
san
francisco
in
connection
with
any
grant
of
moneys
in
education
has
not
included
chinese
children.
and
even
under
title
vi
grant
for
compensatory
education
for
children,
the
appendix
shows
that
the
commodore
stockton
school
in
chinatown
was
included
with
the
special
program
where
the
children
in
that
school
as
part
of
a
poverty
area
covered
by
that
program.
so
yes,
except
under
the
circumstances
i
don’t
think
even
under
that
construction,
san
francisco
has
violated
any
guideline.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
in
fact
that
san
francisco
itself
under
its
own
funds
in
the
last
fiscal
years
supplies
over
50%
of
the
funds
needed
before
these
programs.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
believe
that’s
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
i
do
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
under
brown
versus
board
of
education
that
where
free
public
education
is
supplied,
it
must
be
done
on
an
equal
basis.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
that
this
is
not
part
of
what
may
be
called
minimum
basic
education.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
it
is.
now
i
am
not
admitting
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
english
language
is
not
spoken
without
the
special
courses,
but
supposing
that
is
the
case,
it
is
extremely
important,
one
of
the
most
important
functions
of
the
department
to
teach
these
pupils,
but
there
are
also
other
competing
and
some
may
say
equally
important
matters
that
the
school
department
must
cover
beyond
this
minimum
education,
the
deaf
was
mentioned,
the
mentally
retarded,
the
disabled,
i
think
those
are
questions
that
must
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
administrative
authorities
on
the
local
level.
the
state
guidance
if
it
be
by
state
statute
and
that
the
court
will
not
decide
between
priorities
and
i
contend
that
teaching
of
english
by
the
special
courses
is
one
of
these
educational
priorities.
and
i
think
the
point
that
say
a
thousand
are
left
out,
shows
that
and
in
san
francisco
the
school
board
has
demonstrated
that
it
considers
this
a
highly
important
matter,
but
that
with
a
thousand
left
out
as
of
now,
they
cannot
be
covered
because
they
in
the
estimation
of
the
school
board
there
are
equally
important
special
problems
to
be
covered.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
cannot
answer
that
mr.
justice
blackmun,
except
to
state
that
as
of
now
the
city
is
covering
over
50%
of
the
$2.7
million
that
is
now
spent
on
this
program.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no,
it
wasn’t
applied
by
all
valid
regulations.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
not
under
a
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
--
contract
of
this
sort.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
if
it’s
withdrawn
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
depending
upon
the
terms
of
the
contract?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
they
are
annual
and
i
understand
that
the
funding
by
the
federal
government
under
title
vii
expired
as
of
the
end
of
this
fiscal
year.
so
that
there
are
no
more
federal
funds
available
under
the
title
vii
bilingual
program
participation.
the
question
has
been
of
discrimination
and
past
history
of
discrimination
and
my
adverting
to
the
opinion
was
to
admit
of
course
that
there
is
--
was
education
3007,
but
san
francisco
has
not
followed
that
for
50
years.
and
also
i
have
to
point
out
that
as
mentioned
earlier,
it
is
our
view
that
it
has
not
anything
to
do
with
discrimination
in
any
respect
that
all
of
the
chinese
children
are
not
covered.
it
is
directly
the
--
involved
with
the
recent
immigration
of
chinese
from
--
into
the
united
states.
our
briefs
document
not
only
the
change
of
immigration
act
of
1968,
would
point
out
also
that
under
president
kennedy’s
program
earlier,
the
refugees
from
hong
kong
came
into
san
francisco
and
just
to
illustrate
in
the
interrogatories
which
were
answered
by
the
school
district
in
1970,
it
said
immigrants
who
arrived
in
this
country
between
september
1968
and
september
1969,
got
the
children
to
the
schools,
those
were
the
interrogatories,
answer
691
covering
only
three
schools
in
the
chinatown
area.
immigrants
who
arrived
in
this
country
between
september
1969
and
--
since
september
1969
answer
at
page
57
538.
so
there
has
been
a
tremendous
influx
of
immigrants
and
their
children
into
the
united
states
in
the
last
year
which
has
been
the
cause
of
this
problem
and
it
has
nothing
absolutely
to
do
with
the
historical
discrimination
against
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
as
many
unprivileged?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
demands
on
the
school
department?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
back
to
the
him
case,
the
main
reason
--
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
the
parents
in
chinatown
didn’t
wish
their
children
to
move
from
their
neighborhood
schools
and
incidentally
the
order
of
the
court
has
gone
into
effect
and
the
schools
--
the
three
neighborhood
schools
with
the
predominantly
chinese
students
are
now
in
13
schools
in
a
much
larger
area.
their
main
reason
was
that
they
would
not
be
--
one
of
the
reasons
alleged
was
they
would
not
be
close
to
the
chinese
schools
which
were
operated
not
by
the
school
department,
but
by
the
chinese
community.
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
never
been
any
demands
upon
the
department
itself
to
teach
chinese.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
the
bilingual
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
the
limited
bilingual
program
in
san
francisco
is
designed
to
teach
in
chinese
until
the
child
reaches
a
level
where
he
can
progress
into
the
english
language.
so
in
that
sense,
certain
subjects
are
taught
by
bilingual
teachers
to
chinese-speaking
children
in
chinese.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
traditionally,
the
commodore
stockton
and
other
two
children
--
the
other
two
schools
in
chinatown
have
been
predominantly
chinese
schools
with
chinese
students,
that’s
80%,
90%.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
and
once
again
i
don’t
have
statistics,
but
i
have
knowledge
of
this
where
there
was
such
a
mingling
of
the
chinese
in
that
school
by
teachers
who
not
only
spoke
chinese,
but
students
who
not
only
spoke
english
and
chinese
that
there
was
in
effect
a
bilingual
atmosphere
whereby
english
was
learned
by
those
who
could
not
speak
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
cannot
say
that
myself
as
of
fact,
but
the
80%
and
90%
concentration
in
the
neighborhood
schools
in
chinatown
has
--
is
not
there
anymore.
it
is
a
--
more
like
a
percentage
of
the
50%
whereas
in
the
schools
in
surrounding
areas
--
surrounding
area,
in
a
zone
are
from
15%
to
20%
chinese.
so
the
problem
say
of
getting
the
course
in
one
place
rather
than
having
it
spread
out
has
been
--
is
made
more
difficult.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
my
position
is
that
this
regulation
states
that
it
is
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
believe
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
authority
given
in
that
statute
and
that
title
vi
does
not
purport
to
go
into
programs
for
teaching
those
who
have
language
disability.
and
that
school
authorities
are
in
no
position
to
know
what
this
regulation
means
at
the
time
that
they
obtain
the
grant.
and
it’s
indefinite
and
beyond
the
scope,
that
the
regulation
is
indefinite,
but
it
is
an
indefinite
application
of
the
limits
of
authority
which
are
covered
by
title
vi.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
representing
the
san
francisco
school
district
and
it
is
our
position
of
course
that
we
don’t
depreciate
or
challenge
any
particular
educational
aids
which
a
school
district
provides
including
the
one
to
provide
special
instruction
in
english
for
non-speaking
english
students.
and
in
fact,
contrary
to
statements
that
have
been
made,
the
san
francisco
school
district
which
operates
all
the
elementary,
junior
high
schools
and
high
schools
in
san
francisco
has
for
several
years
been
committed
to
a
policy
of
providing
this
special
language
instruction
not
only
to
chinese
students,
but
to
spanish
children
as
well
and
have
now
started
a
japanese
non-speaking
english
program
in
san
francisco.
and
in
the
years
1967
--
1966,
1967
the
program
for
the
chinese
school
children
was
started.
commencing
in
1967,
1968,
the
special
instruction
in
english
program
was
started
for
spanish-speaking
children.
and
commencing
a
1971,
1972,
a
separate
special
instruction
in
english
program
was
commenced
for
filipino
children
which
program
had
been
part
of
the
spanish-speaking
program
up
to
this
point
and
as
i
mentioned
a
special
program
for
japanese-speaking
children
was
started
this
year.
the
expenditures
on
this
program
arose
to
$2.37
million
in
1972,
1973.
for
the
chinese
program,
$1,196,550.00
was
spent
during
that
fiscal
year,
for
the
spanish
program,
$956,000.00
and
for
the
filipino
program
$222,000.00.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
this
case
i
think
is
a
case
which
says
that
the
school
board
in
san
francisco
must
supply
special
instruction
in
english
to
all
students
who
may
require
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
these
are
my
preliminary
statements
to
show
the
disposition
of
san
francisco
as
far
as
an
attitude
toward
instructing
its
children
in
--
who
do
not
speak
the
language.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
our
contention
is
that
contrary
to
what
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
stated,
say
they
are
the
group
who
has
not
been
reached
as
far
as
programs
are
concerned
and
that
san
francisco
under
the
equal
protection
clause
must
cover
every
child
with
a
non-english
speaking
problem.
it
is
our
contention
of
course
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause
this
is
not
so
that
the
school
district
has
not
the
constitutional
duty
to
provide
such
instruction.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
didn’t
mean
to
say
that
we
are
covering
the
program
entirely.
i
was
saying
that
the
attitude
and
the
direction
and
the
practice
of
san
francisco
is
to
import
as
much
of
this
type
of
program
as
it
can.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
in
1971
when
this
case
was
decided,
there
were
--
under
stipulation
of
facts
and
it
was
not
a
stipulation
that
the
children
as
stated
where
doomed,
that
they
did
not
get
education.
the
stipulation
was
that
1,800
needed
special
instruction
in
the
english
language,
chinese
children.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
and
there
where
2,856
students
in
the
school
district
with
who
are
non-english
speaking
chinese
children
and
of
that
the
number
1,800
received
no
special
instruction.
the
remaining
1,066
did
receive
special
instruction
in
chinese
in
three
programs.
one
was
the
chinese
center
program,
one
was
the
bilingual
program
which
was
funded
by
the
federal
government
and
the
third
was
the
esl
programming,
which
is
the
second
language
program,
which
the
rest
of
the
children
that
did
get.
and
the
california
bilingual
education
act
of
1972
called
upon
the
districts
in
california
to
specify
the
children
in
their
district
which
had
limited
english
speaking
ability
and
also
to
make
the
list
of
those
children
who
had
no
english
speaking
ability
and
pursuant
to
that
census
which
was
taken
by
the
classroom
teachers
in
san
francisco
in
april
of
this
year,
the
extent
of
the
problem
and
the
numbers
of
children
who
do
not
speak
english
or
have
a
limited
speaking
english
ability
at
the
present
time
or
in
april
of
this
year
are
as
follows.
there
are
9,000
children
who
have
either
limited
english
speaking
or
no
english
speaking
ability;
non-english
speaking,
1,180;
limited
english-speaking
7,904,
and
while
we
deal
only
with
the
chinese
children
in
this
case,
i
think
the
court
will
be
interested
in
the
statistics
as
far
as
the
other
groups
are
concerned.
the
spanish
total
both
of
non-speaking
and
limited
speaking,
2,980.
the
filipino
total,
including
both
1,395.
the
japanese
total,
202.
the
samoan
total,
179
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
and
i
haven’t
got
to
the
chinese
yet.
others
not
including
with
chinese,
747.
the
chinese
census
report
gives
a
total
of
3,457.
non-english
speaking,
436
and
they
broke
it
down
into
schools
of
the
436,
there
were
232
in
the
elementary
school,
138
in
the
junior
high
and
66
in
the
senior
high,
non-english
speaking;
limited
english
speaking
ability,
1,768.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
this
is
not
in
the
appendix
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
this
is
[voice
overlap]
compiled
in
the
statistics
of
the
school
board.
i
would
be
very
happy
if
i
may
to
supply
the
copy
of
the
statistics
as
part
of
the
record.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
i
have
supplied
i
believe
both
mr.
pottinger
and
mr.
steinman
with
this
report
and
the
chinese
program
today
shows
2,012
enrolled.
now
i
presented
these
statistics
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
there
are
13,037
chinese
children
in
the
school.
there
are
--
the
difference
between
3,457
and
2,012
that
do
not
speak
the
language
and
do
not
have
special
instruction
in
english.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
primarily
there
is
--
the
main
answer
is
that
san
francisco
would
attempt
to
cover
all
if
it
had
be
resources
with
which
to
do
it,
that
is
the
inclination
of
the
board
of
education.
however,
they
have
not
moved
up
on
the
complete
coverage
of
all
theses
children
because
of
the
other
requirements
of
the
budget.
i
think
that’s
the
answer
in
simple
form.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
of
course
if
required
under
the
constitution
to
do
so,
they
would,
but
there
is
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
that’s
my
point,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
great
purposes
of
the
country
education.
what
as
stated
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
rodriguez
case,
it
is
not
a
fundamental
right,
it
is
not
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
so
that
the
great
aim
and
problem
and
work
of
school
districts
and
states
in
the
educational
field
while
one
of
the
most
important
is
not
one
that
unless
every
facet
of
the
problem
is
covered
is
one
where
a
person
can
come
into
court
and
state
i
am
not
covered.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
was,
what
is
the
classification
between
the
chinese
students
who
do
receive
special
english
education
and
those
who
do
not?
the
classification
in
this
case
if
the
court
please
is
something
that
the
original
petitioners
have
made.
it
is
our
position
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
there
is
no
constitutional
duty
to
supply
any
of
the
non-english
chinese
students,
the
special
courses
in
the
english
language.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
these
are
--
as
far
as
education
is
concerned,
these
are
educational
policy
questions
when
they
don’t
rise
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
it’s
the
combination
of
things.
that
is
one
of
the
factors.
i
will
advert
to
what
has
been
talked
about.
the
immigration
problem
in
san
francisco,
it
is
the
increasing
number
of
non-english
chinese
speaking
students
that
are
coming
in.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
there
is
a
certain
limit
to
the
number
and
i
have
been
advised
that
they
are
taken
into
the
chinese
center
to
determine
their
ability,
but
because
there
aren’t
enough
teachers
and
enough
classes,
it’s
really
by
waiting
list.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
believe
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
that
is
part
of
the
problem
of
course,
especially
with
the
chinese
language
to
get
qualified
to
teachers.
but
of
course
again
with
the
unlimited
resources,
that’s
a
problem
that
could
be
surmounted.
i
say,
it
is
partly
a
question
of
resources
of
the
school
district
and
in
california
and
in
san
francisco
in
particular,
the
school
district
is
operating
to
the
limit
of
its
budget,
so
it
would
mean
an
reallocation
of
items
to
fully
staff
this
program,
and
of
course,
i
might
add
that
this
is
one
of
the
competing
special
educational
features
which
children
with
other
handicaps
require
attention
of
the
school
board
as
well.
this
--
it’s
been
mentioned
that
the
chinese
are
suspect
classification
and
there
has
been
a
long
history
of
discrimination
against
the
chinese.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
briefly
revert
or
speak
about
the
decision
in
guey
heung
lee
versus
david
johnson
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
denied
the
application
for
a
stay
after
a
denial
by
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i
want
to
state
that
this
is
not
--
was
not
a
petition
by
the
school
district
of
san
francisco.
it
was
a
petition
by
some
chinese
parents
who
did
not
wish
to
have
their
children
move
from
the
schools
in
chinatown
to
the
schools
that
were
provided
for
them
under
the
integration
order
in
the
case
that
the
city
and
county
school
district
was
involved
in,
that
is
johnson
against
the
san
francisco
board
of
education.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
douglas
and
that’s
what
i
wanted
to
talk
about.
you
mentioned
in
your
decision
and
correctly,
properly
and
rightly
so
that
under
the
education
code
of
california,
there
was
a
provision
not
repealed
until
1947
that
that
could
be
provided
for
chinese,
japanese
and
children
of
mongolian
origin,
separate
schools
and
if
separate
schools
were
provided,
these
children
could
not
attend
other
schools.
now,
i
can
speak
from
the
experience
now
of
50
years
and
research,
confirms
it
that
in
san
francisco,
there
has
not
been
a
separate
school
under
this
statute
as
far
as
any
children
of
san
francisco
are
concerned,
including
chinese
children.
and
it
is
a
fact
that
the
chinese
like
the
irish
and
italians
who
first
settled
around
the
chinatown
area
when
they
fanned
out
over
the
city
to
the
various
neighborhoods
and
went
to
the
neighborhood
schools,
the
chinese
children
did
so
as
well.
and
i
ran
across
which
i
think
the
court
might
be
interested
in,
a
recent
book
called
“longtime
california:
a
documentary
study
of
an
american
chinatown”
by
victor
and
barry
nee,
and
on
account
of
interview
with
lee-lun
chin
who
is
now
age
73
and
is
one
of
the
staff
of
the
young
china
daily,
stated
that
he
left
san
francisco
after
the
fire
and
earthquake
and
went
up
to
a
small
town
under
sacramento
river
and
when
his
father
found
that
he
couldn’t
attend
a
school
there,
he
returned
to
san
francisco
and
went
to
lower
high
school.
he
says,
“well
in
1910,
my
parents
sent
me
back
to
san
francisco
because
orientals
weren’t
allowed
in
the
schools
down
there.
i
was
going
to
a
lowell
high
school
and
there
i
met
some
young
chinese
students.”
at
lowell
high
school,
we’ve
mentioned
on
our
brief
was
then
and
is
now
the
academic
high
school
in
san
francisco
where
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
the
chinese
have
a
greater
percentage
in
that
school
than
their
citywide
percentages
for
high
school
students
as
the
academic
school
of
san
francisco
and
in
1910,
mr.
chin
went
there.
that
documents
of
course
what
i
know
to
be
the
fact
that
the
chinese
as
with
others
moved
out
into
the
schools
of
san
francisco.
and
to
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
they
are
children
who
attend
the
schools
in
chinatown
and
the
surrounding
area
as
well
as
other
districts
of
the
city
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
pardon?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
they
aren’t
taught
by
special
instruction
in
english.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
revert
and
i
think
to
the
statement
in
the
--
in
meyer
versus
nebraska,
which
of
course
is
the
leading
case
on
the
question
of
english
in
the
schools.
and
where
mr.
justice
holmes
dissented
from
the
opinion,
would
stated
that
the
best
thing
for
young
children
and
i
think
he
mentioned
poles
and
russians
who
have
no
english
in
their
homes
was
to
come
to
the
school
and
not
be
taught
in
german
as
primarily.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
so
that
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
they
are
being
taught
those
that
aren’t
covered
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
well,
he
stated
and
i
want
to
follow
that
up
but
the
best
thing
for
a
child
who
can’t
speak
a
language
to
do
without
any
special
instruction
is
to
come
to
an
english-speaking
school.
and
i
think
common
experience
as
well
some
of
the
authorities,
although,
bilingual
or
special
courses
are
better.
[voice
overlap]
you
nevertheless
by
the
immersion
process,
a
child
learns
to
speak
and
especially
a
child
because
it
is
easier,
the
authority
say
for
child
to
learn
language
by
total
immersion
than
other
individuals.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no
formal
training
but
i
can’t
concur
in
that
entirely
i
think
any
child
who
comes
to
a
school
and
i
want
to
mention
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
you
would.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
--
it
is
rather
non-fact
question,
i
think
you
would
learn
anywhere,
but
i
think
that
being
immersed
in
that
atmosphere
where
nothing
is
spoken,
but
the
language
around
you,
from
a
child’s
viewpoint
the
authorities
tell
us.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
you
mean
to
teach?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
don’t
come
here
and
say
that
this
is
the
best
way.
i
think
it
is
the
least
effective
way
and
that
would
be
better
if
san
francisco
could
cover
all
of
its
children.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
that’s
i
say
it
is
yes.
little
effective,
not
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
because
the
program
as
yet
hasn’t
covered
them,
but
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
they
find
that
children
on
the
waiting
list,
i
have
been
told
is,
go
back
to
the
school
where
there
is
no
special
language
education.
and
by
the
time
they
get
back
to
number
one
on
the
waiting
list,
they
no
longer
have
a
need
for
the
special
education.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
believe
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
speaks
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
a
race,
minority,
national
origin.
no
chinese-speaking
child
is
discriminated
against
in
any
of
these
courses
is
--
has
the
same
education
as
others.
he
may
not
be
able
to
benefit
by
it
as
much,
but
it
is
not
up
to
the
hew
to
determine
what
effect
this
has.
i
think
if
it
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
it
has
the
authority,
but
until
it
is
declared
by
this
court
to
be
a
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
believe
not,
they
are
--
the
guidelines
adopted
in
1970
talks
for
effective
programs
for
non-english-speaking
children.
and
in
the
grants
which
san
francisco
has
for
instance
under
title
vii
of
the
education
act
for
bilingual
program,
this
is
not
only
a
program
which
hew
gives
the
funds
for
to
teach
this
particular
--
or
to
help
solve
this
particular
problem,
but
requires
that
on
the
basis
of
title
vi
that
there
be
no
discrimination
and
in
that
program,
children
of
other
national
origins
are
included.
the
other
program
as
mentioned
in
the
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
do
not.
the
program
under
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
except
that
i
think
this
record
shows
that
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
that
would
be
part
of
the
statute,
a
direct
statement
and
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
under
the
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no,
i
would
say
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
if
there
was
a
statute
specifically
directing
this,
yes,
i
would
say
so.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
except
i
think
there
is
a
further
point
whether
san
francisco
in
connection
with
any
grant
of
moneys
in
education
has
not
included
chinese
children.
and
even
under
title
vi
grant
for
compensatory
education
for
children,
the
appendix
shows
that
the
commodore
stockton
school
in
chinatown
was
included
with
the
special
program
where
the
children
in
that
school
as
part
of
a
poverty
area
covered
by
that
program.
so
yes,
except
under
the
circumstances
i
don’t
think
even
under
that
construction,
san
francisco
has
violated
any
guideline.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
in
fact
that
san
francisco
itself
under
its
own
funds
in
the
last
fiscal
years
supplies
over
50%
of
the
funds
needed
before
these
programs.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
believe
that’s
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
i
do
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
under
brown
versus
board
of
education
that
where
free
public
education
is
supplied,
it
must
be
done
on
an
equal
basis.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
that
this
is
not
part
of
what
may
be
called
minimum
basic
education.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
think
it
is.
now
i
am
not
admitting
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
english
language
is
not
spoken
without
the
special
courses,
but
supposing
that
is
the
case,
it
is
extremely
important,
one
of
the
most
important
functions
of
the
department
to
teach
these
pupils,
but
there
are
also
other
competing
and
some
may
say
equally
important
matters
that
the
school
department
must
cover
beyond
this
minimum
education,
the
deaf
was
mentioned,
the
mentally
retarded,
the
disabled,
i
think
those
are
questions
that
must
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
administrative
authorities
on
the
local
level.
the
state
guidance
if
it
be
by
state
statute
and
that
the
court
will
not
decide
between
priorities
and
i
contend
that
teaching
of
english
by
the
special
courses
is
one
of
these
educational
priorities.
and
i
think
the
point
that
say
a
thousand
are
left
out,
shows
that
and
in
san
francisco
the
school
board
has
demonstrated
that
it
considers
this
a
highly
important
matter,
but
that
with
a
thousand
left
out
as
of
now,
they
cannot
be
covered
because
they
in
the
estimation
of
the
school
board
there
are
equally
important
special
problems
to
be
covered.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
cannot
answer
that
mr.
justice
blackmun,
except
to
state
that
as
of
now
the
city
is
covering
over
50%
of
the
$2.7
million
that
is
now
spent
on
this
program.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
no,
it
wasn’t
applied
by
all
valid
regulations.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
not
under
a
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
--
contract
of
this
sort.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
if
it’s
withdrawn
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
depending
upon
the
terms
of
the
contract?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
they
are
annual
and
i
understand
that
the
funding
by
the
federal
government
under
title
vii
expired
as
of
the
end
of
this
fiscal
year.
so
that
there
are
no
more
federal
funds
available
under
the
title
vii
bilingual
program
participation.
the
question
has
been
of
discrimination
and
past
history
of
discrimination
and
my
adverting
to
the
opinion
was
to
admit
of
course
that
there
is
--
was
education
3007,
but
san
francisco
has
not
followed
that
for
50
years.
and
also
i
have
to
point
out
that
as
mentioned
earlier,
it
is
our
view
that
it
has
not
anything
to
do
with
discrimination
in
any
respect
that
all
of
the
chinese
children
are
not
covered.
it
is
directly
the
--
involved
with
the
recent
immigration
of
chinese
from
--
into
the
united
states.
our
briefs
document
not
only
the
change
of
immigration
act
of
1968,
would
point
out
also
that
under
president
kennedy’s
program
earlier,
the
refugees
from
hong
kong
came
into
san
francisco
and
just
to
illustrate
in
the
interrogatories
which
were
answered
by
the
school
district
in
1970,
it
said
immigrants
who
arrived
in
this
country
between
september
1968
and
september
1969,
got
the
children
to
the
schools,
those
were
the
interrogatories,
answer
691
covering
only
three
schools
in
the
chinatown
area.
immigrants
who
arrived
in
this
country
between
september
1969
and
--
since
september
1969
answer
at
page
57
538.
so
there
has
been
a
tremendous
influx
of
immigrants
and
their
children
into
the
united
states
in
the
last
year
which
has
been
the
cause
of
this
problem
and
it
has
nothing
absolutely
to
do
with
the
historical
discrimination
against

mr.

as
many
unprivileged?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
demands
on
the
school
department?
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
back
to
the
him
case,
the
main
reason
--
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
the
parents
in
chinatown
didn’t
wish
their
children
to
move
from
their
neighborhood
schools
and
incidentally
the
order
of
the
court
has
gone
into
effect
and
the
schools
--
the
three
neighborhood
schools
with
the
predominantly
chinese
students
are
now
in
13
schools
in
a
much
larger
area.
their
main
reason
was
that
they
would
not
be
--
one
of
the
reasons
alleged
was
they
would
not
be
close
to
the
chinese
schools
which
were
operated
not
by
the
school
department,
but
by
the
chinese
community.
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
never
been
any
demands
upon
the
department
itself
to
teach
chinese.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
the
bilingual
--
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
the
limited
bilingual
program
in
san
francisco
is
designed
to
teach
in
chinese
until
the
child
reaches
a
level
where
he
can
progress
into
the
english
language.
so
in
that
sense,
certain
subjects
are
taught
by
bilingual
teachers
to
chinese-speaking
children
in
chinese.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
traditionally,
the
commodore
stockton
and
other
two
children
--
the
other
two
schools
in
chinatown
have
been
predominantly
chinese
schools
with
chinese
students,
that’s
80%,
90%.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
yes.
and
once
again
i
don’t
have
statistics,
but
i
have
knowledge
of
this
where
there
was
such
a
mingling
of
the
chinese
in
that
school
by
teachers
who
not
only
spoke
chinese,
but
students
who
not
only
spoke
english
and
chinese
that
there
was
in
effect
a
bilingual
atmosphere
whereby
english
was
learned
by
those
who
could
not
speak
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
i
cannot
say
that
myself
as
of
fact,
but
the
80%
and
90%
concentration
in
the
neighborhood
schools
in
chinatown
has
--
is
not
there
anymore.
it
is
a
--
more
like
a
percentage
of
the
50%
whereas
in
the
schools
in
surrounding
areas
--
surrounding
area,
in
a
zone
are
from
15%
to
20%
chinese.
so
the
problem
say
of
getting
the
course
in
one
place
rather
than
having
it
spread
out
has
been
--
is
made
more
difficult.
mr.
thomas
m.
o’conner
my
position
is
that
this
regulation
states
that
it
is
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
believe
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
authority
given
in
that
statute
and
that
title
vi
does
not
purport
to
go
into
programs
for
teaching
those
who
have
language
disability.
and
that
school
authorities
are
in
no
position
to
know
what
this
regulation
means
at
the
time
that
they
obtain
the
grant.
and
it’s
indefinite
and
beyond
the
scope,
that
the
regulation
is
indefinite,
but
it
is
an
indefinite
application
of
the
limits
of
authority
which
are
covered
by
title
vi.
