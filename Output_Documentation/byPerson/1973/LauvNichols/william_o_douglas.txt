this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
is
a
class
action
brought
by
non-english
speaking
chinese
student
in
public
schools
of
san
fransisco,
the
defendants
being
the
officials
who
are
responsible
for
the
operation
of
the
school
system,
and
they
seek
relief
against
what
they
call
the
unequal
educational
opportunities
which
are
alleged
to
violate
the
requirements
of
federal
law.
there
is
no
specific
remedy
urged
upon
us.
teaching
english
to
the
students
of
chinese
ancestry
who
do
not
speak
the
language
is
one
possible
choice,
giving
instruction
to
this
group
in
chinese
is
another.
there
may
still
be
other
remedies.
the
petitioner
asked
only
that
the
board
of
education
be
directed
to
apply
its
expertise
to
the
problem
and
rectify
this
situation.
the
district
court
denied
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
reformed
and
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
do
not
reach
any
question
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
has
been
much
vigorously
argued.
our
decision
rests
entirely
upon
the
section
601
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
excludes
from
participation
in
federal
financial
assistance
recipients
of
aid
could
discriminate
against
racial
groups
and
as
we
analyze
the
regulations
done
with
this
act,
such
a
showing
has
been
made.
accordingly
we
reverse
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
