justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
mr.
pottinger,
this
applies
only
to
the
school
districts
that
participate
in
the
grant
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
would
that
--
is
that
rather
comprehensive
throughout
the
country
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
virtually
every
school
district
in
one
form
or
another?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pottinger,
i
note
in
your
brief,
you
support
mr.
steinman’s
constitutional
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather,
what
you
told
us
about
the
scope
of
the
601,
if
we
agree
with
this,
we
don’t
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
argument,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
but
that
is
not
so
here
and
i
--
ordinarily,
i
think
our
practice
has
been
–
our
policy
rather,
not
to
reach
constitutional
questions
with
statutory
determination
favorable
to
the
petitioners
can
be
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
suggest
the
technique
is
simply
to
decide
the
statutory
issue,
and
say
therefore,
it’s
not
necessary
for
us
and
the
other
court
to
have
reached
the
constitutional
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
but
mr.
o’conner
i
gather
if
title
vi
does
reach
this
kind
of
prop,
the
funding
would
be
adequate,
would
it
not,
to
include
these
plaintiffs
as
well
as
those
presently
being
taught
in
those
programs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
the
condition
were
that
all
of
these
plaintiffs
as
well
as
the
other
chinese
children
had
to
be
given
the
benefit
of
this
kind
of
teaching
under
title
vi,
san
francisco
would
have
to
match
whatever
the
federal
grant
was,
would
it
not?
if
it
didn’t,
the
federal
grant
i
gather
could
be
withdrawn
in
its
entirety,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
o’conner
i
noticed
in
the
mr.
pottinger’s
brief
at
footnote
4,
at
page
12,
this
i
think
has
a
connection
with
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question.
it
stated
that
you’re
already
obligated
by
contract.you
comply
with
both
the
regulations
and
guidelines.
you
contractually
agreed
to
comply
with
title
vi
and
all
requirements
imposed
by
hew
and
immediately
to
take
any
measures
necessary
to
effectuate
this
agreement
and
mr.
hahn
recites
at
a
case
some
to
county
school
district
for
this
proposition
that
that
contract
is
a
binding
and
specifically
enforcible,
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
is
so
i
don’t
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
i
suppose
so
long
is
that
contract
is
effective,
san
francisco
is
not
at
liberty
to
pull
out
of
the
program,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
terminate
the
program
at
any
time,
your
participation
in
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
a
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
know
what
those
terms
are
under
those
contracts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
should
be
annual
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
we
know
that
those
now
getting
the
instruction,
do
they
learn
english?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
those
programs
succeed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
steinman,
may
i
just
change
the
subject
a
second.
i
notice
at
4
(a)
and
5
(a)
of
your
brief,
is
this
contract,
title
vi
contract,
which
apparently
dates
back
to
1965.
how
does
the
school
district
get
out
from
under
that
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
at
least
[attempt
to
laughter]
the
breadth
of
this
contract
would
indicate
that
you
can’t
get
out
of
a
particular
program,
but
you
got
to
get
out
of
all
programs.
all
title
vi
programs
are
covered
by
this
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
san
francisco
couldn’t
just
drop
this
one,
it
would
have
to
drop
all
funded
programs,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
practically
how
much
of
a
title
vi
programs
are
there.
just
how
much
practically
is,
is
that
a
problem?
well,
what
you’re
getting
at
is
you
want
us
to
decide
the
constitutional
question.
what
i
am
putting
to
you,
why
should
we,
if
we
can
decide
this
on
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
why
can’t
we
wait
till
they
arise
if
the
statute
protects
it,
covers
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don’t
we
usually?
