chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
72-6520,
lau
and
others
against
nichols.
mr.
steinman,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
why
not?
aren’t
the
interest
of
five
people
just
as
important
as
1,800?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitutional
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
something
can
only
be
one
thing
and
that
is
to
teach
them
english,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say,
the
constitutional
right
is
the
same
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
cannot
speak
english,
there
is
a
constitutional
obligation
on
the
government
to
teach
them
english.
that’s
your
point,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
--
that’s
a
yes
or
a
no?
i
don’t
mean
to
press
you
unduly,
but
that’s
a
yes
or
a
no,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
obviously
that
that
applies,
to
pursue
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
point
to
russians,
israelis,
norwegians,
danes
etcetera.
there
are
no
--
there
is
no
stopping
point,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pottinger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn’t
this
court
suggest
that
that
was
the
remedy
i
think
in
rosado
against
wyman
or
one
of
the
new
york
cases
that
when
states
are
not
complying
with
conditions
of
grants
that
the
remedy
was
to
cut
off
the
grant
and
that
the
district
court
had
an
alternative
remedy
or
duty
indeed
to
stop
the
expenditure
of
federal
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
relate
that
concretely
for
me
to
the
colloquy
we
had
with
your
associate
on
russians,
portuguese,
danes,
israelis
etcetera?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
other
chinese,
other
chinese?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
clear
that
the
title
vi
remedy
is
broad
enough
to
reach
all
the
people
who
are
now
before
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
conceivably
a
state,
perhaps
remote,
but
it’s
conceivable
that
the
state
might
say,
if
those
are
the
burdens
on
title
vi
grants,
we’ll
reject
all
these
grants
and
then
our
school
system
without
federal
aid
and
then
that
case
would
present
pure
constitutional
question,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
pottinger.
mr.
o’conner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let’s
come
down
to
the
1,800,
are
they
all
covered
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
where
do
we
find
this
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
where
will
the
court
find
it
if
they
want
it
to
go
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
consider
it
an
important
if
you
want
us
to
think
about
it
then
we
should
have
it
and
of
course,
you
can
give
to
your
friend.
he
indicated
that
there
was
an
inability
to
give
us
these
figures.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
you
may
possibly
be
running
into
there
are
some
equal
protection
problems
if
you
give
some
chinese,
non-english
speaking
chinese
training
in
english
and
do
not
give
it
to
others
when
they
are
--
except
for
that
difference,
exactly
the
same,
they
are
part
of
a
category
and
identifiable
group.
if
they
can’t
speak
english
they
are
of
chinese
origin
perhaps
you
can
address
yourself
to
that
right
after
lunch.
mr.
o’conner
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
my
question
was,
if
you
give
it
to
some
then
does
that
raise
equal
protection
problems
for
giving
it
to
all.
suppose
for
example
that
you
gave
automobile
licenses
to
one
group,
but
denied
it
to
the
others
and
they
are
--
except
for
that
alike?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
there
a
policy
with
reference?
is
there
a
policy
that
explains
why
several
hundred
of
them
get
it
and
several
hundred
don’t
get
it
or
is
it
just
the
accident
of
the
shortage
of
funds
and
budget?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
they
pick
the
ones
who
are
going
to
get
it
as
distinguished
from
those
who
are
not
going
to
get
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
show
how
many
teachers
in
the
san
francisco
system
teach,
speak
both
english
and
chinese?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
a
shortage
of
teachers?
i
get
some
intimations
of
that,
the
shortage
of
qualified
people
to
teach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
o’conner
let
me
put
this
hypothetical
question
to
you
and
it
may
shed
some
light
for
me.
let’s
start
with
the
assumption
that
there
is
no
constitutional
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
furnish
any
public
schools
at
all.
assume
that
for
a
moment,
but
then
the
state
and
the
local
government
does
undertake
to
furnished
schools,
but
they
have
enough
money
to
take
care
only
18,000
children
in
the
primary
schools
and
there
are
20,000
and
you
just
put
the
other
2,000
on
the
waiting
list
and
say
we
will
work
you
in
when
we
get
enough
money
in
the
budget.
do
you
think
that
would
give
you
any
equal
protection
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
how
do
you
distinguish
that
between
giving
this
english
language
training
to
a
thousand
or
1,400
of
the
chinese-speaking
students
and
not
giving
it
to
4
or
5
or
800
who
are
on
the
waiting
list?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
teach
the
english
language?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
end
of
the
year,
at
the
end
of
the
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
haven't
specific
information,
but
it
is
a
grant
terms,
i
presume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
time
has
expired
mr.
o’conner.
thank
you.
mr.
steinman,
one
practical
problem
that
may
or
may
not
to
be
lurking
in
this
case.
i
gather
that
there
are
at
least
three
and
perhaps
more
major
chinese
dialects
spoken
in
such
form
that
the
person
from
one
area
of
china
can
barely
communicate
with
another.
what
is
the
obligation
of
the
state?
must
they
have
classes
in
the
cantonese
dialect
and
then
some
other
dialect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
chinese?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
chinese
dialect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
gather
an
intimation
from
what
you
said
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
state
of
california
or
any
particular
school
district
could
not
afford
to
withdraw
totally
from
federal
programs.
that
is
their
losses
would
be
far
more
than
their
gains
even
if
the
result
was
that
they
did
not
need
to
run
any
special
schools.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
off-hand
what
in
millions
of
dollars
how
much
california
is
getting
under
these
programs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
must
be
a
very
large
sum
of
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
lastly,
more
i
should
assume
than
the
$2
million
they
are
now
spending
for
the
second
language
program.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
72-6520,

against

will
be
