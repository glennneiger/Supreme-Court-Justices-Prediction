of
course
this
takes
us
to
the
next
obvious
question.
suppose
there
were
five
portuguese
children
who
couldn’t
speak
anything,
but
portuguese.
then
in
your
analysis,
is
the
school
system
obliged
to
teach
them,
give
them
special
instruction
in
english
also?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
your
position
the
same
as
to
deaf
children
too?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
not
concerned
then
with
the
deaf
children?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
steinman,
i
take
it
that
the
title
vi
argument
was
never
--
couldn’t
have
been
raised
in
the
district
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
congress
had
intended
to
have
title
vi
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
situation,
do
you
think
they
would
have
been
more
precise
in
their
statutory
language?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
the
portuguese?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
o’conner
if
you
lose
this
case,
what
will
happen?
is
the
city
likely
to
withdraw
all
special
instruction
to
all
chinese?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you
disagree
with
the
professor’s
suggestion
that
there
were
as
many
unprivileged
back
in
1967
as
there
are
now?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
who
are
not
receiving
english
instruction?
his
point,
i
thought
made
three
times
was
this
is
not
attributable
to
the
relaxation
of
the
immigration
requirements,
you
disagree
with
that?
