mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
california
like
most
states
of
the
union
has
sought
--
has
seen
fit
to
compel
its
students
to
attend
school
to
set
as
one
of
the
educational
goals,
the
mastery
of
the
english
language
indeed
to
require
a
demonstration
in
this
language
as
a
condition
for
graduation
from
high
school.
ascribing
this
critical
role
to
the
english
language
has
not,
however,
in
our
opinion,
the
issue
in
contention.
the
issue
is
whether
in
so
doing
the
state
in
this
case,
the
san
francisco
school
board
assumes
a
correlative
obligation
to
insure
that
national
origin
minority
children
are
not
effectively
excluded
from
participation
in
the
educational
process
by
virtue
of
that
choice.
we
believe
that
such
an
obligation
does
exist.
now,
as
mentioned
to
you,
there
are
two
areas
of
the
law
under
which
this
obligation
maybe
shown
to
exist.
the
equal
protection
clause
to
which
mr.
steinman
has
addressed
himself,
and
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
to
which
we
wish,
the
united
states
wishes
to
address
itself
at
this
time.
it
can
be
shown
in
this
case
that
the
conditions
for
application
of
title
vi
exist.
the
language
itself
of
title
vi,
the
three
basic
protections
of
title
vi
go
beyond
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
a
coverage.
that
title
provides
that
no
person
shall
on
grounds
of
color,
race
or
national
origin
first
to
be
excluded
from
participation
in
a
program,
second
be
denied
the
benefits
of
a
program,
or
third
in
more
equal
protection
type
language
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under
a
program
or
any
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
in
other
words,
title
vi
is
not
coterminous
with
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
was
enacted
not
only
pursuant
to
that
amendment,
but
pursuant
to
the
welfare
clause
and
hence
as
it
is
by
the
necessary
in
proper
clause.
and
thereby
finding
that
the
power
of
federal
government
is
the
basis
for
this
enactment
to
condition
the
expenditure
of
its
funds
upon
reasonable
restrictions
related
to
the
purpose
or
purposes
for
which
those
grants
were
made.
this
is
clear
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
act
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
would
reach
virtually
all
pubic
school
systems.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
does.
there
is
only
one.
the
legislative
history
to
title
vi
makes
clear
that
even
the
opponents
of
the
act
conceded,
indeed
discussed
in
some
colloquy
the
broader
basis
for
the
act,
that
is
broader
than
the
equal
protection
clause.
now
san
francisco
in
this
particular
case
has
bound
itself
to
compliance
with
title
vi
and
its
regulations
and
all
requirements
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
imposed
pursuant
to
those
regulations.
specifically,
it
has
said
in
a
so-called
441
assurance
of
compliance
that
it
hereby
agrees
that
it
will
comply
with
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
all
requirements
imposed
by
or
pursuant
to
the
regulation
of
the
department
of
hew
to
the
end
that
no
person
shall
be
denied
the
benefits
of
that
act.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
justice
it
does.
in
this
particular
case
it
was
not
invoked
because
in
fact
this
case
is
in
court
and
hew
under
its
own
regulations
has
the
administrative
discretion
to
allow
the
case
to
go
forward
toward
enforcement
through
the
federal
courts
rather
than
by
a
duplicate
of
administrative
process.
nevertheless,
the
provisions
of
title
vi
under
the
regulations
would
apply
equally
whether
the
form
is
the
federal
district
court
or
hew.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
that
could
have
been
done
in
this
case,
had
the
district
court
so
found
its
duty
to
be
such
under
title
vi.
of
course
it
did
not
do
so,
because
it
did
not
in
fact
we
believe
to
give
reasonable
consideration
to
title
vi.
the
regulations
of
title
vi
make
even
more
specific,
the
obligation
of
school
boards
not
to
provide
any
service
or
other
benefit
in
such
a
way
that
is
different
from
that
provided
to
other
groups
of
children
to
restrict
an
individual
in
a
way
that
would
restrict
his
enjoinment
of
an
advantage
or
privilege
or
to
deny
an
individual
an
opportunity
to
participate.
and
of
course
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
such
cases
as
the
public
utilities
commission
of
california
against
the
united
states,
regulations
so
are
issued
have
the
force
of
law.
now
in
addition
to
that,
however,
in
interpreting
both
the
basic
protections
of
title
vi
and
the
regulations,
hew
has
indeed
gone
further.
it
has
construed
the
meaning
of
title
vi
in
a
national
origin
discrimination
memorandum
relevant
to
this
case
by
stating
that
where
inability
to
speak
and
understand
the
english
language
excludes
national
origin
minority
group
children
from
the
effective
participation
in
the
educational
program
offered
by
the
school
district,
the
school
district
must
take
affirmative
steps
to
rectify
the
language
deficiency.
again,
as
this
court
has
held
in
such
cases
as
trafficante
against
metropolitan
life
insurance
or
griggs
against
duke
power
or
udall
against
tallman
where
a
consistent
administrative
construction
of
the
act
by
hew
like
the
former
regulations
of
the
act
are
shown
that
consistent
construction
is
entitled
to
great
weight.
in
fact,
hew
for
a
number
of
years
now
has
sought
to
implement
title
vi
by
this
consistent
known
official
policy.
in
71
school
districts
which
have
been
notified
of
violations
of
title
vi
or
reviewed
for
violations,
34
of
which
have
been
notified
of
non-compliance,
80
of
which
had
been
reviewed
pursuant
to
another
statute
which
refers
to
the
national
origin
minority
memorandum
and
the
like.
there
is
in
other
words
consistent
practice
and
known
contours
of
what
this
policy
and
practice
would
lead
to.
and
may
i
say
at
this
moment
that
we
in
the
united
states
also
appreciate
the
specter
of
a
chaotic
policy
that
might
flow
from
a
ruling
which
would
require
a
massive
effort
on
behalf
of
virtually
every
child
who
could
show
in
any
sense
an
ethnic
heritage.
we
are
not
contending
as
mr.
steinman
has
pointed
out,
(a)
that
the
law
would
require
such
chaos
or
(b)
that
in
this
particular
case,
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
class
of
students
who
are
effectively
excluded.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
burger
i
would
be
pleased
to.
i
think
that
there
are
three
points
that
are
crucial
to
understanding
that
specter.
the
first
is
that
any
child
on
account
of
national
origin
who
may
suffer
discrimination
is
indeed
protected
under
title
vi
as
well
we
believe
as
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
actual
remedy
of
course
would
be
something
that
would
determine
whether
a
specter
truly
exists
or
not
or
whether
chaos
would
exist
but
the
right
is
protected.
second,
we
believe,
it’s
clear
from
longstanding
administrative
practice
at
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
that
effective
implementation
of
title
vi
in
this
area
does
not
lead
to
a
difficult
or
burdensome
effort
on
the
part
of
school
districts
to
meet
specific
needs
of
virtually
every
ethnic
minority.
and
the
reasons
for
that
are
simple,
we
believe,
historically
the
19th
century
system
of
assimilation
of
ethnic
minorities,
particularly
caucasian
minorities
in
this
country
has
been
one
of
a
melting
pot.
but
historically
as
this
honorable
court
knows,
non-caucasian
minorities
in
this
country
have
not
been
able
to
assimilate
in
quite
the
same
fashion.
there
has
been
insularity
historically
in
this
country
and
in
this
particular
case
that
insularity
is
even
greater
where
the
language
difficulties
or
incompatibilities
exist.
indeed,
this
case
does
go
beyond
the
chinese-speaking
community.
it
affects
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
spanish-speaking
children
in
our
society
who
although
their
ancestors
predate
my
own
and
many
caucasians
in
this
country
still
do
not
speak
the
english
language,
still
are
the
objects
of
societal
forms
of
discrimination
and
still
in
the
context
of
this
case
are
effectively
excluded
from
any
participation
in
the
educational
process.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
i
would
like
to
correct
myself
in
that
regard.
i
would
say
western
european
caucasian
or
western
european
whites
as
the
regulations
define
them.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
the
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
the
portuguese
and
spanish
clearly
are
western
european,
if
my
understanding
of
geography
is
still
correct,
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
the
--
without
going
too
much
into
the
history
of
the
mexican-american
population
in
this
country
that
it
took
significant
degree,
that
particular
segment
of
our
population
has
not
been
treated
as
western
european
caucasians.
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
is
a
simple
one
and
that
is
that
the
specter
of
a
morass
of
different
rules
and
regulations
for
virtually
all
ethnic
groups
simply
has
not
been
the
experience
that
hew
has
had
in
this
field.
indeed
it
has
focused
on
minorities
such
as
the
spanish-speaking
and
chinese
minorities
of
this
country
and
indian-american
minorities
who
suffered
historically
and
continue
to
suffer
from
this
kind
of
exclusion
in
ways
that
other
minorities
typically
do
not.
they
may
and
have
shown
of
course
their
rights
are
protected,
but
typically
we
are
not
faced
with
that
jungle
and
welter
of
regulations.
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
believe
it
is
controlling.
i
believe
that
we
are
not
looking
to
the
question
of
alienage
versus
citizenship
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
justice
white
with
all
deference
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well
i
believe
that
it
isn’t
--
is
not
the
case
that
they
do
treat
all
chinese
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
point
and
to
underline
mr.
steinman’s
point
in
this
regard,
the
class
of
petitioners
here
is
excluded
entirely.
it
is
not
a
question
of
balancing
careful
educational
considerations
in
this
case.
there
is
total
--
effectively
total
--
virtually
total
exclusion
in
this
particular
case
as
in
the
case
of
so
many
other
school
districts
which
we
believe
the
importance
of
this
decision
will
affect.
finally,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
raised
with
regard
to
congressional
intent.
we
believe
that
the
congress
has
considered
in
its
language
the
question
which
is
presented
to
the
court
today.
it
presented
this
not
only
in
terms
of
mandating
regulations
which
deal
with
the
issue
and
specifically
the
national
origin
memorandum
which
flows
lawfully
from
that
act.
but
it
dealt
with
it
in
section
602
of
the
act
in
which
the
united
states
congress
provided
that
each
federal
department,
in
this
case
hew,
which
is
empowered
to
extend
federal
financial
assistance,
is
authorized
indeed
the
languages
directed
to
effectuate
the
provisions
of
section
601,
the
basic
three
protections
consistent
with
the
achievement
of
the
statute
which
authorizes
the
expenditure
of
money.
in
other
words,
section
601
protections
are
to
be
defined
in
part
by
the
objectives
to
be
served
by
the
funding
program.
in
this
particular
case,
there
are
two
critically
important
funding
programs
which
give
meaning
and
content
to
601
and
that
is
the
bilingual
programs
under
title
vii
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
and
title
i
of
esea
which
focuses
federal
money
on
disadvantaged
children.
in
both
cases,
the
congress
recognized
that
hew
would
be
attempting
to
serve
the
children
who
are
petitioners
in
this
case
with
those
programs
and
thereby
said
specifically
that
section
602
would
incorporate
the
meaning
of
those
programs
into
601,
the
basic
protections
of
the
act.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
possible
that
that
is
the
case.
we
do
believe
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
support
the
same
relief.
it
is
possible
that
there
are
petitioners
or
classes
of
petitioners
who
will
not
be
affected
by
federal
funds
and
thereby
be
treated
separately.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
believe
that
distinctions
that
do
exist
here
may
be
addressed
by
mr.
steinman,
that
is
adequate.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
but
we
believe
that
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
this
decision
we
have
on
other
cases
similarly
situated
that
would
not
be
correct.
in
this
particular
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well
that
is
distinctly
possible.
i
would
say
that
the
effect
of
this
decision
in
the
court
below
where
a
fourteenth
amendment
decision
has
been
made
adverse
to
our
position
is
adversely
effecting
the
department
of
hew
and
perhaps
other
school
districts
in
their
ability
to
deal
with
the
problems
that
are
presented
in
this
case
to
that
extent
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
regrettably
the
ninth
circuit
chose
not
to
deal
with
title
vi
in
any
reasonable
way.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
it
is
correct
that
that
would
happen.
by
the
same
token,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
a
decision
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
now
stands
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
would
hope
that
this
court
would
deal
with
that
because
it
is
so
fundamentally
in
error
in
our
position
and
because
of
that
error
it's
likely
to
affect
additional
cases
such
as
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
however,
by
attempting
to
dispose
of
the
title
vi
argument
in
a
virtually
a
single
sentence
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument
was
clear
error.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
california
like
most
states
of
the
union
has
sought
--
has
seen
fit
to
compel
its
students
to
attend
school
to
set
as
one
of
the
educational
goals,
the
mastery
of
the
english
language
indeed
to
require
a
demonstration
in
this
language
as
a
condition
for
graduation
from
high
school.
ascribing
this
critical
role
to
the
english
language
has
not,
however,
in
our
opinion,
the
issue
in
contention.
the
issue
is
whether
in
so
doing
the
state
in
this
case,
the
san
francisco
school
board
assumes
a
correlative
obligation
to
insure
that
national
origin
minority
children
are
not
effectively
excluded
from
participation
in
the
educational
process
by
virtue
of
that
choice.
we
believe
that
such
an
obligation
does
exist.
now,
as
mentioned
to
you,
there
are
two
areas
of
the
law
under
which
this
obligation
maybe
shown
to
exist.
the
equal
protection
clause
to
which
mr.
steinman
has
addressed
himself,
and
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
to
which
we
wish,
the
united
states
wishes
to
address
itself
at
this
time.
it
can
be
shown
in
this
case
that
the
conditions
for
application
of
title
vi
exist.
the
language
itself
of
title
vi,
the
three
basic
protections
of
title
vi
go
beyond
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
a
coverage.
that
title
provides
that
no
person
shall
on
grounds
of
color,
race
or
national
origin
first
to
be
excluded
from
participation
in
a
program,
second
be
denied
the
benefits
of
a
program,
or
third
in
more
equal
protection
type
language
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under
a
program
or
any
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
in
other
words,
title
vi
is
not
coterminous
with
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
was
enacted
not
only
pursuant
to
that
amendment,
but
pursuant
to
the
welfare
clause
and
hence
as
it
is
by
the
necessary
in
proper
clause.
and
thereby
finding
that
the
power
of
federal
government
is
the
basis
for
this
enactment
to
condition
the
expenditure
of
its
funds
upon
reasonable
restrictions
related
to
the
purpose
or
purposes
for
which
those
grants
were
made.
this
is
clear
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
act
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
would
reach
virtually
all
pubic
school
systems.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
does.
there
is
only
one.
the
legislative
history
to
title
vi
makes
clear
that
even
the
opponents
of
the
act
conceded,
indeed
discussed
in
some
colloquy
the
broader
basis
for
the
act,
that
is
broader
than
the
equal
protection
clause.
now
san
francisco
in
this
particular
case
has
bound
itself
to
compliance
with
title
vi
and
its
regulations
and
all
requirements
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
imposed
pursuant
to
those
regulations.
specifically,
it
has
said
in
a
so-called
441
assurance
of
compliance
that
it
hereby
agrees
that
it
will
comply
with
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
all
requirements
imposed
by
or
pursuant
to
the
regulation
of
the
department
of
hew
to
the
end
that
no
person
shall
be
denied
the
benefits
of
that
act.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
justice
it
does.
in
this
particular
case
it
was
not
invoked
because
in
fact
this
case
is
in
court
and
hew
under
its
own
regulations
has
the
administrative
discretion
to
allow
the
case
to
go
forward
toward
enforcement
through
the
federal
courts
rather
than
by
a
duplicate
of
administrative
process.
nevertheless,
the
provisions
of
title
vi
under
the
regulations
would
apply
equally
whether
the
form
is
the
federal
district
court
or
hew.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
that
could
have
been
done
in
this
case,
had
the
district
court
so
found
its
duty
to
be
such
under
title
vi.
of
course
it
did
not
do
so,
because
it
did
not
in
fact
we
believe
to
give
reasonable
consideration
to
title
vi.
the
regulations
of
title
vi
make
even
more
specific,
the
obligation
of
school
boards
not
to
provide
any
service
or
other
benefit
in
such
a
way
that
is
different
from
that
provided
to
other
groups
of
children
to
restrict
an
individual
in
a
way
that
would
restrict
his
enjoinment
of
an
advantage
or
privilege
or
to
deny
an
individual
an
opportunity
to
participate.
and
of
course
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
such
cases
as
the
public
utilities
commission
of
california
against
the
united
states,
regulations
so
are
issued
have
the
force
of
law.
now
in
addition
to
that,
however,
in
interpreting
both
the
basic
protections
of
title
vi
and
the
regulations,
hew
has
indeed
gone
further.
it
has
construed
the
meaning
of
title
vi
in
a
national
origin
discrimination
memorandum
relevant
to
this
case
by
stating
that
where
inability
to
speak
and
understand
the
english
language
excludes
national
origin
minority
group
children
from
the
effective
participation
in
the
educational
program
offered
by
the
school
district,
the
school
district
must
take
affirmative
steps
to
rectify
the
language
deficiency.
again,
as
this
court
has
held
in
such
cases
as
trafficante
against
metropolitan
life
insurance
or
griggs
against
duke
power
or
udall
against
tallman
where
a
consistent
administrative
construction
of
the
act
by
hew
like
the
former
regulations
of
the
act
are
shown
that
consistent
construction
is
entitled
to
great
weight.
in
fact,
hew
for
a
number
of
years
now
has
sought
to
implement
title
vi
by
this
consistent
known
official
policy.
in
71
school
districts
which
have
been
notified
of
violations
of
title
vi
or
reviewed
for
violations,
34
of
which
have
been
notified
of
non-compliance,
80
of
which
had
been
reviewed
pursuant
to
another
statute
which
refers
to
the
national
origin
minority
memorandum
and
the
like.
there
is
in
other
words
consistent
practice
and
known
contours
of
what
this
policy
and
practice
would
lead
to.
and
may
i
say
at
this
moment
that
we
in
the
united
states
also
appreciate
the
specter
of
a
chaotic
policy
that
might
flow
from
a
ruling
which
would
require
a
massive
effort
on
behalf
of
virtually
every
child
who
could
show
in
any
sense
an
ethnic
heritage.
we
are
not
contending
as
mr.
steinman
has
pointed
out,
(a)
that
the
law
would
require
such
chaos
or
(b)
that
in
this
particular
case,
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
class
of
students
who
are
effectively
excluded.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
burger
i
would
be
pleased
to.
i
think
that
there
are
three
points
that
are
crucial
to
understanding
that
specter.
the
first
is
that
any
child
on
account
of
national
origin
who
may
suffer
discrimination
is
indeed
protected
under
title
vi
as
well
we
believe
as
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
actual
remedy
of
course
would
be
something
that
would
determine
whether
a
specter
truly
exists
or
not
or
whether
chaos
would
exist
but
the
right
is
protected.
second,
we
believe,
it’s
clear
from
longstanding
administrative
practice
at
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
that
effective
implementation
of
title
vi
in
this
area
does
not
lead
to
a
difficult
or
burdensome
effort
on
the
part
of
school
districts
to
meet
specific
needs
of
virtually
every
ethnic
minority.
and
the
reasons
for
that
are
simple,
we
believe,
historically
the
19th
century
system
of
assimilation
of
ethnic
minorities,
particularly
caucasian
minorities
in
this
country
has
been
one
of
a
melting
pot.
but
historically
as
this
honorable
court
knows,
non-caucasian
minorities
in
this
country
have
not
been
able
to
assimilate
in
quite
the
same
fashion.
there
has
been
insularity
historically
in
this
country
and
in
this
particular
case
that
insularity
is
even
greater
where
the
language
difficulties
or
incompatibilities
exist.
indeed,
this
case
does
go
beyond
the
chinese-speaking
community.
it
affects
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
spanish-speaking
children
in
our
society
who
although
their
ancestors
predate
my
own
and
many
caucasians
in
this
country
still
do
not
speak
the
english
language,
still
are
the
objects
of
societal
forms
of
discrimination
and
still
in
the
context
of
this
case
are
effectively
excluded
from
any
participation
in
the
educational
process.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
i
would
like
to
correct
myself
in
that
regard.
i
would
say
western
european
caucasian
or
western
european
whites
as
the
regulations
define
them.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
the
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
the
portuguese
and
spanish
clearly
are
western
european,
if
my
understanding
of
geography
is
still
correct,
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
the
--
without
going
too
much
into
the
history
of
the
mexican-american
population
in
this
country
that
it
took
significant
degree,
that
particular
segment
of
our
population
has
not
been
treated
as
western
european
caucasians.
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
is
a
simple
one
and
that
is
that
the
specter
of
a
morass
of
different
rules
and
regulations
for
virtually
all
ethnic
groups
simply
has
not
been
the
experience
that
hew
has
had
in
this
field.
indeed
it
has
focused
on
minorities
such
as
the
spanish-speaking
and
chinese
minorities
of
this
country
and
indian-american
minorities
who
suffered
historically
and
continue
to
suffer
from
this
kind
of
exclusion
in
ways
that
other
minorities
typically
do
not.
they
may
and
have
shown
of
course
their
rights
are
protected,
but
typically
we
are
not
faced
with
that
jungle
and
welter
of
regulations.
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
believe
it
is
controlling.
i
believe
that
we
are
not
looking
to
the
question
of
alienage
versus
citizenship
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
justice
white
with
all
deference
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well
i
believe
that
it
isn’t
--
is
not
the
case
that
they
do
treat
all
chinese
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
point
and
to
underline
mr.
steinman’s
point
in
this
regard,
the
class
of
petitioners
here
is
excluded
entirely.
it
is
not
a
question
of
balancing
careful
educational
considerations
in
this
case.
there
is
total
--
effectively
total
--
virtually
total
exclusion
in
this
particular
case
as
in
the
case
of
so
many
other
school
districts
which
we
believe
the
importance
of
this
decision
will
affect.
finally,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
raised
with
regard
to
congressional
intent.
we
believe
that
the
congress
has
considered
in
its
language
the
question
which
is
presented
to
the
court
today.
it
presented
this
not
only
in
terms
of
mandating
regulations
which
deal
with
the
issue
and
specifically
the
national
origin
memorandum
which
flows
lawfully
from
that
act.
but
it
dealt
with
it
in
section
602
of
the
act
in
which
the
united
states
congress
provided
that
each
federal
department,
in
this
case
hew,
which
is
empowered
to
extend
federal
financial
assistance,
is
authorized
indeed
the
languages
directed
to
effectuate
the
provisions
of
section
601,
the
basic
three
protections
consistent
with
the
achievement
of
the
statute
which
authorizes
the
expenditure
of
money.
in
other
words,
section
601
protections
are
to
be
defined
in
part
by
the
objectives
to
be
served
by
the
funding
program.
in
this
particular
case,
there
are
two
critically
important
funding
programs
which
give
meaning
and
content
to
601
and
that
is
the
bilingual
programs
under
title
vii
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
and
title
i
of
esea
which
focuses
federal
money
on
disadvantaged
children.
in
both
cases,
the
congress
recognized
that
hew
would
be
attempting
to
serve
the
children
who
are
petitioners
in
this
case
with
those
programs
and
thereby
said
specifically
that
section
602
would
incorporate
the
meaning
of
those
programs
into
601,
the
basic
protections
of
the
act.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
possible
that
that
is
the
case.
we
do
believe
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
support
the
same
relief.
it
is
possible
that
there
are
petitioners
or
classes
of
petitioners
who
will
not
be
affected
by
federal
funds
and
thereby
be
treated
separately.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
believe
that
distinctions
that
do
exist
here
may
be
addressed
by
mr.
steinman,
that
is
adequate.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
but
we
believe
that
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
this
decision
we
have
on
other
cases
similarly
situated
that
would
not
be
correct.
in
this
particular
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well
that
is
distinctly
possible.
i
would
say
that
the
effect
of
this
decision
in
the
court
below
where
a
fourteenth
amendment
decision
has
been
made
adverse
to
our
position
is
adversely
effecting
the
department
of
hew
and
perhaps
other
school
districts
in
their
ability
to
deal
with
the
problems
that
are
presented
in
this
case
to
that
extent
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
regrettably
the
ninth
circuit
chose
not
to
deal
with
title
vi
in
any
reasonable
way.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
it
is
correct
that
that
would
happen.
by
the
same
token,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
a
decision
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
now
stands
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
would
hope
that
this
court
would
deal
with
that
because
it
is
so
fundamentally
in
error
in
our
position
and
because
of
that
error
it's
likely
to
affect
additional
cases
such
as
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
however,
by
attempting
to
dispose
of
the
title
vi
argument
in
a
virtually
a
single
sentence
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument
was
clear
error.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
