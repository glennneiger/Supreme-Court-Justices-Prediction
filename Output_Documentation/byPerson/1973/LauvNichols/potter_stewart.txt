justice
potter
stewart
but,
if
i
may
interrupt
you.
factually,
are
these
1,800
more
or
less
students
you
--
they
are
referred
to
in
your
brief,
and
i
think
in
the
record
is
chinese
students,
they
are
--
they
are
not
chinese-americans,
they
are
chinese?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
they
are?
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
been
a
good
deal
of
recent
immigration
in
the
united
states
and
particularly
into
the
city
of
san
francisco,
has
there
not
from
taiwan?
justice
potter
stewart
has
--
and
this
1,800
is
out
of
how
many
chinese
or
chinese-american
students
in
the
school
population
of
san
francisco?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
was
that
13,000
or
15,000
figure?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
these
--
this
group
of
1,800
is
something
more
than
10%?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
i
was
just
curious
whether
or
not
native-born
american,
that
is
american
citizens
in
san
francisco
grow
up
not
knowing
english,
or
whether
this
group
does
embrace
primarily
recent
immigrants
from
taiwan
and
elsewhere.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
know
the
argument
but
my
query
as
to
why,
it
was
as
to
why
they
don’t
speak
english
and
i
think
that
may
have
something
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
the
chinatown
part
of
san
francisco,
is
it
true
that
most
people
there
don’t
speak
english?
justice
potter
stewart
only
a
ghetto
doesn’t
answer
that
question
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
a
vast
majority
now,
these
1,800,
are
they
native-born?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn’t
hew
itself
has
a
--
have
a
sanction
that
defines
non-compliance
with
title
vi
i.e.
cutting
off
the
fund?
justice
potter
stewart
if
all
of
this
is
true,
what’s
this
case
about
then?
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
told
us
that
you
provided
for
a
japanese,
filipinos,
chicanos,
and
chinese
and
the
chinese
who
are
involved
here,
what
is
it,
just
your
program
for
the
chinese
is
not
big
enough?
is
that
the
--
is
that
what
the
case
is
about?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
you
have
told
us
that
your
--
the
practice
and
policy
is
to
teach
english
to
these
people
and
that
prompted
my
inquiry
as
to
if
that
is
true,
what’s
this
case
for
controversy?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
are
doing
this,
as
i
thought
--
i’d
understood
you
are
telling
us
that
you
are,
then
the
--
nobody
needs
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
is
your
constitutional
duty?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
o’conner,
have
there
been
any
demands
upon
the
san
francisco
school
system
to
conduct
any
classes
in
the
chinese
language?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
by
these
people
or
similarly
situated
people?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
to
teach
classes,
teach
arithmetic
or
whatever
in
the
chinese
language,
that’s
what
i’m
asking
about,
not
to
teach
the
chinese
language,
but
to
teach
the
school
in
the
chinese
language
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
geography
or
social
studies
or
whatever?
justice
potter
stewart
in
those
--
in
the
schools
located
in
the
chinatown
area
of
san
francisco
have,
in
the
past
any
classes
been
taught
in
chinese?
now
i'd
again,
i
don’t
mean
teaching
the
chinese
language,
i
mean
teaching
arithmetic
in
chinese?
justice
potter
stewart
and
by
chinese
i
expect
you
mean,
as
been
understood
here,
actually
americans
of
chinese
descent?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
most
have
been?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
now
disappearing
because
of
the
school
desegregation
orders?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
steinman,
would
your
constitutional
grievance
be
met
if
the
classes
were
conducted
for
these
1,800
children
in
chinese,if
they
went
to
school
where
they
could
learn
manual
training
and
arithmetic
and
domestic
science
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
just
asking
about
your
constitutional
grievance?
justice
potter
stewart
well
but
let’s
--
we
are
talking
about
your
constitutional
grievance,
not
about
the
california
law?
justice
potter
stewart
just
taught
in

(inaudible)
theory,
educational
theory
around
and
sometimes
at
least
by
people
taking
extreme
position
sometimes
caused
in
--
cause
the
terms
or
because
of
the
constitution
that
it’s
wrong
to
homogenize
everybody.
it’s
wrong
to
destroy
the
culture
and
the
traditions
of
various
groups,
be
they
american-indians
or
chinese
or
american-negroes
or
whoever
that
it’s

upon
the
schools
for
example
to
conduct
classes
in
the
vernacular
of
the
so-called
ghettos
where
american-negroes
live
rather
than
in
the
kind
of
english
that
you
and
i
are
speaking
to
each
other
hopefully.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
not,
i’m
not.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
wondered
if
there
might
not
be
alternative
answers
therefore
to
your
constitutional
grievance.
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
a
little
hard
to
teach
shakespeare
or
charles

in

might
it
not?
