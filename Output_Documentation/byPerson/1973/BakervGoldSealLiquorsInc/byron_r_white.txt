justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you’ve
got
two
completely
different
points
there.
one
of
them
is
this
as
i
take
it;
that
if
the
trustee
have
never
sue
and
the
other
railroad
simply
wanted
to
establish
a
claim
for
damages,
would
it
have
had
to
go
to
the
reorganization
court
or
was
this
a
liquidated
claim
that
was
fileable
as
a
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
would
have
had
to
sue
just
like
it
did
here,
the
trustee
in
an
appropriate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
once,
it
was
establish,
the
only
way
that
it
collect
its
claim
would
be
to
file
it.
otherwise,
it
would
be
a
preference
to
that
creditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that’s
what
underlies
the
rule
against
set
offs,
but
in
ordinary
bankruptcy,
section
68
expressed
that
permits
set
offs?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
wherever
set
off
is
allowed,
it
does
effect
to
preference?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
the
other
point
is
then
not
only
the
collect
of
the
--
whether
--
well,
you’ve
answered
my
one
question
as
to
whether
the
other
court
had
jurisdiction
to
give
judgment
to
the
claimant
and
you
say
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it’s
really
the
remaining
point
as
to
whether
that
claim
may
be
satisfied
out
of
a
claim
of
the
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
relevance,
if
any
of
sections
31
and
67
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
would
--
that
they
just
note
the
claim
or
was
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
was
a
--
so
in
effect
it
was
--
it
really
was
an
admitted
liquidated
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
is,
do
you
think
that
that
was
subject
to
the
filing
of
the
proof
of
claim
without
a
judgment?
that’s
what
i
asked
your
colleague
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
asked
your
colleague
whether
or
not
this
was
fileable
as
a
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
court
without
further
liquidation.
now,
i
had
always
thought
that
if
you
got
a
note
--
if
a
creditor
got
a
notice
like
that
from
the
trustee,
he
was
invited
to
file
a
claim
and
then
it
was
admitted
in
that
amount.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
that
isn’t
true
then
it
wasn’t
liquidated?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
made
the
claim
prior
to
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
they
see
you’ll
need
not
file
a
claim.
now
what
that
means
to
me
is
that
they
will
take
account
of
that
claim
in
for
preparation
of
plan
of
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
of
filing
of
the
claim.
that’s
an
admitted
claim
that
would
be
taken
care
of
in
the
plan,
that’s
the
way
i
look
at
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
if
that’s
all
you
wanted
to
claim;
you
would
not
need
the
file
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not.
if
you
are
satisfied
with
that
amount,
you
would
not
have
to
take
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
also
have
said
if
you
don’t
object
to
this
amount
we
need
to
file
a
claim
as
far
as
bankruptcy
for
amendment
you
wouldn’t
take
that
amount
into
consideration
conforming?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
have
to
break
that
time
making
explain,
if
you
didn’t
to
provide
after
having
said
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
involves
the
suit
by
trustee
of
a
railroad
in
reorganization
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
for
freight
charges,
the
suit
being
against
the
shipper.
shipper
counterclaimed
for
cargo
loss
and
damage.
the
trustee
had
his
judgment
for
his
freight
charges
and
the
shipper
for
his
cargo
damages
and
the
question
arose
whether
the
shipper
could
set
off
his
judgment
for
the
cargo
damage
against
what
he
owed
to
railroad
for
freight
charges
and
pay
over
only
the
balance.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
shipper
could
set
off
on
judgment
against
the
other.
in
an
opinion
that
mr.
justice
douglas
has
written
for
the
court,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
hold
that
in
the
circumstances
present
here
in
this
railroad
reorganization,
the
set
off
was
improper.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
mr.
justice
powell
joined
him
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you’ve
got
two
completely
different
points
there.
one
of
them
is
this
as
i
take
it;
that
if
the
trustee
have
never

and
the
other
railroad
simply
wanted
to
establish
a

for

would
it
have
had
to
go
to
the
reorganization
court
or
was
this
a
liquidated
claim
that
was
fileable
as
a
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
would
have
had
to
sue
just
like
it
did
here,
the
trustee
in
an
appropriate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
once,
it
was
establish,
the
only
way
that
it
collect
its
claim
would
be
to
file
it.
otherwise,
it
would
be
a
preference
to
that
creditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that’s
what
underlies
the
rule
against
set
offs,
but
in
ordinary
bankruptcy,
section
68
expressed
that
permits
set
offs?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
wherever
set
off
is
allowed,
it
does
effect
to
preference?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
the
other
point
is
then
not
only
the
collect
of
the
--
whether
--
well,
you’ve
answered
my
one
question
as
to
whether
the
other
court
had
jurisdiction
to
give
judgment
to
the
claimant
and
you
say
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it’s
really
the
remaining
point
as
to
whether
that
claim
may
be
satisfied
out
of
a
claim
of
the
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
relevance,
if
any
of
sections
31
and
67
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
would
--
that
they
just
note
the
claim
or
was
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
was
a
--
so
in
effect
it
was
--
it
really
was
an
admitted
liquidated
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
is,
do
you
think
that
that
was
subject
to
the
filing
of
the
proof
of
claim
without
a
judgment?
that’s
what
i
asked
your
colleague
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
asked
your
colleague
whether
or
not
this
was
fileable
as
a
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
court
without
further
liquidation.
now,
i
had
always
thought
that
if
you
got
a
note
--
if
a
creditor
got
a
notice
like
that
from
the
trustee,
he
was
invited
to
file
a
claim
and
then
it
was
admitted
in
that
amount.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
that
isn’t
true
then
it
wasn’t
liquidated?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
made
the
claim
prior
to
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
they
see
you’ll
need
not
file
a
claim.
now
what
that
means
to
me
is
that
they
will
take
account
of
that
claim
in
for
preparation
of
plan
of
reorganization?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
of
filing
of
the
claim.
that’s
an
admitted
claim
that
would
be
taken
care
of
in
the
plan,
that’s
the
way
i
look
at
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
if
that’s
all
you
wanted
to
claim;
you
would
not
need
the
file
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not.
if
you
are
satisfied
with
that
amount,
you
would
not
have
to
take
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
also
have
said
if
you
don’t
object
to
this
amount
we
need
to
file
a
claim
as
far
as
bankruptcy
for
amendment
you
wouldn’t

shipper
counterclaimed
for

loss
and

the
trustee
had
his
judgment
for
his
freight
charges
and
the
shipper
for
his
cargo
damages
and
the
question
arose
whether
the
shipper
could
set
off
his
judgment
for
the
cargo
damage
against
what
he
owed
to
railroad
for
freight
charges
and

the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the

could
set
off
on
judgment
against
the
other.
in
an
opinion
that
mr.
justice
douglas

written
for

court,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
hold
that
in
the
circumstances
