mr.
theodore
j.
herst
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
basic
question
that
runs
through
the
entire
thread
of
this
case
is
exactly
how
much
power
judge
fullam
has,
sitting
in
philadelphia
by
his
orders
to
control
the
disposition
of
litigation
in
illinois
and
actually
by
examining
the
text
of
those
orders
what
he
actually
intended
to
do.
coming
first
to
the
most
important
point
the
matter
of
jurisdiction,
there
was
no
question
that
the
court
of
bankruptcy
under
section
77
(a)
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
all
of
the
debtor’s
property
at
the
time
of
the
filling
of
the
petition,
but
we
contend
that
this
shows
an
action
was
not
such
property.
we
say
there
was
no
actual
possession.
there
was
no
constructive
possession.
there
was
in
fact
to
substantial
adverse
claim
because
this
railroad
owed
this
company
almost
two-and-a-half
times
the
amount
they
claimed
and
it
being
an
adverse
claim,
could
be
subject
to
disposition
only
by
plenary
jurisdiction,
by
a
plenary
suit
which
the
trustees
did
commence.
we
state
further
that
at
this
time
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
no
summary
jurisdiction
at
any
time
over
gold
seal
liquors.
we
were
outside
the
jurisdiction.
we
didn’t
even
file
a
claim
the
trustees
recorded
from
the
books
that
they
have
the
amount
that
was
owed
us
and
advice
us
by
notice
that
a
claim
was
noted
in
the
amount
and
in
an
approximate
amount
as
to
what
we
had.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
well,
we
didn’t
file
a
claim
in
the
reorganization,
your
honor
because
we
saw
the
lawsuit
coming
and
because
frankly,
we
were
concerned
as
to
what
the
effect
of
participating
in
philadelphia
would
be.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
your
honor,
what
they
did
is
they
sent
a
notice
if
we
look
at
the
genesis
of
the
lawsuit,
the
suit
was
filed
in
the
end
of
1970.
under
date
of
february
1,
1971
to
which
was
appended
a
statement
of
the
account
as
of
march
6,
1971,
a
document
which
was
received
by
my
client
at
the
end
of
june
1971.
i
got
the
following
day,
they
said,
“this
notice
does
not
constitute
an
admission
of
the
amounts
of
forth
above
or
any
other
amount
is
due
and
owing
to
you
by
the
debtor.
it
is
merely
intended
to
notify
you
that
the
records
of
the
debtor
indicate
that
the
attached
described
claims
have
been
heretofore
presented
by
you
to
the
debtor
and
to
advice
you
that
the
formal
proof
of
claim
need
not
be
filed
by
you
in
this
reorganization
proceeding
for
these
claims.”
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
because
we
filed
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
i
see
what
you
mean
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
in
that
amount.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
and
the
amount
was
also
different.
the
amount
shown
on
this
claim
is
different
than
the
amount
we
originally
claimed
and
the
amount
that
counsel
and
i
subsequently
thrashed
out
which
was
embodied
in
the
stipulation
as
the
actual
amount.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
we
completely
--
actually
claimed
close
to
$20,000.00,
$19,000.00
in
some
figure.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
yes.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
from
the
trustees.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
no,
they
say
it
does
not
constitute
an
admission,
but
they
simply
state
to
notify
us
that
the
attached
described
claims
and
it’s
actually
their
statement
of
account
have
been
presented
by
us,
have
been
presented
by
you
to
the
debtor
because
we’ve
made
the
claims
under
the
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
prior
to
reorganization
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
a
claim
on
the
bill
of
lading,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
yes,
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
in
that
amount,
i
suppose
that
is
the
only
way
you
could
regard
it.
now,
but
secondly
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
it
was
not
agreed.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
i
suppose
if
we
would
walk
away
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
mean
there
are
a
lot
of
ifs
mr.
justice
white,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question.
if
we
wanted
--
if
we
assumed
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
solvent
situation,
if
we
assume
that
we
sooner
or
later
might
get
something
if
we
were
satisfied
with
the
approximate
figure
all
other
things
being
considered
i
assume
we
could
walk
away
and
do
nothing
and
in
the
ordinary
course
just
watch
it.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
secondly,
we
believe
continuing
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
sir?
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
that
is
correct.
and
in
this
particular
case
mr.
chief
justice,
we
never
even
thought
of
the
taking
the
first
step
because
we
were
being
sued.
by
the
time
we
got
this
notice
we
were
in
the
district
court
in
illinois.
we
had
reached
the
pleading
stage.
we
were
litigating
so,
we
never
would
have
gone
into
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
right,
whatever
the
results
would
be
of
the
lawsuit
would
in
effect
be
our
claim
and
therefore
our
claim
in
effect
by
the
lawsuit
has
been
reduced
to
$11,000.00.
secondly,
i
just
think
that
this
is
unwarranted
extension
of
attempted
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
reorganization
court
but
i
don’t
think
the
reorganization
court
intended
so
do.
there
were
two
orders
which
we
would
have
before
us.
the
first
order
to
examine
is
order
number
1
entered
by
judge
kraft
in
june
of
1970.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
your
honor,
that
order
is
found
in
the
appendix
at
page
a22
and
following.
that
order
is
what
might
be
called
a
typical
stock
order
if
there’ll
be
such
because
it’s
the
usual
order
that
has
been
entered
in
railroad
reorganization
cases
and
the
paragraphs
conform
to
the
statutory
language.
the
key
paragraphs
for
this
purpose
would
be
found
at
page
831
paragraphs
9
and
10.
these
are
found
in
most
reorganization
cases.
the
first
one
to
maintain
the
status
quo
is
an
injunction
against
interfering
with
a
property
of
the
debtor
by
garnishment,
by
levying,
by
interfering
with
liens
and
in
our
opinion
against
voluntary
set
offs
because
all
of
the
cases
urged
by
the
trustees
in
the
courts
below
concerning
this
question
involved
voluntary
set
offs,
actions
of
self-help,
some
in
aggregative
circumstances.
in
the
susquehanna
case
the
court
noted
that
what
had
happened
was
that
the
bank
by
appropriating
deposit
balances
had
seized
the
operating
cash
to
the
railroad,
equitable
principles
again.
justice
cardozo’s
rule
in
lowden
whether
or
not
68
should
apply.
obviously,
in
susquehanna
from
the
facts,
it
shouldn’t
have
applied
and
didn’t.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
exactly,
lowden
was
a
loose
case.
in
effect
three
questions
were
asked
and
justice
cardozo
said
the
first
two
are
general
and
then
explaining
why
they
were
general,
he
said,
that
you
would
have
to
have
a
very
flexible
rule.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
order
571,
the
second
order
that
i
would
allude
to
entered
in
the
summer
of
1972
by
judge
fullam.
these
involved
shippers
doing
things
by
themselves
setting
off
their
own
claims
or
alleging
the
existence
of
prior
contractual
arrangements
with
a
debtor
which
would
allow
them
to
set
off
unilaterally.
there
was
no
instance
in
that
case
of
judicial
action
and
i
don’t
think
that
judge
fullam
should
be
accused
any,
not
that
he
is,
but
even
considered
to
have
intended
that
because
in
his
order
571
which
is
found
at
page
1
(a)
of
our
blue
covered
brief,
he
extends
his
orders
to
all
persons,
firms
and
corporations
served
with
a
copy
of
the
petition
and
we
were
never
served,
and
he
prohibits
them
from
setting
off
or
attempting
to
set
off
obligations.
we
humbly
suggest
and
submit
that
the
litigation
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
of
a
compulsory
counterclaim
and
a
plenary
suit
is
not
the
type
of
thing
that
judge
fullam
was
talking
about
in
order
571.
if
we
want
to
find
out
what
congress
actually
intended
in
the
legislation,
i
frankly
have
had
not
too
much
success
in
looking
over
the
reports
of
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
shared
by
representative
summers
on
the
subcommittee
on
bankruptcy,
headed
by
mr.
walter
chandler
about
the
time
that
section
77
was
amended
in
1935
and
subsequent.
we
find
much
material
on
the
modification
of
security
interests,
the
amount
of
consent
necessary
to
implement
a
plan,
the
need
for
railroad
reorganization
legislation
to
supplant
the
vices
of
equity
receiverships,
but
nothing
on
this
one
question,
but
we
do
see
one
interesting
thing,
one
indication
of
congressional
intent.
we
find
first
in
section
77
(l),
sub-paragraph
(l)
of
section
77,
the
statement
of
the
courts
in
reorganization
of
all
the
powers
of
district
courts
sitting
in
bankruptcy.
the
creditor’s
rights
are
the
same.
the
court’s
powers
are
the
same
and
secondly
in
section
77
(j),
we
find
the
proviso
so
to
the
effect
that
the
courts
are
precluded
from
enjoining
actions
arising
out
of
the
operation
of
the
railroads.
this
proviso
was
reflected
on
a
typical
order
in
the
single
appendix
at
page
831,
lines
18
to
21
of
paragraph
9,
down
to
near
the
bottom.
the
court
reflects
the
statutory
mandate
which
has
provided
it
suits
or
claims
for
damages
caused
by
the
operation
of
trains,
etcetera
may
be
prosecuted
the
judgment
at
state.
and
the
michigan
court
recognized
that
to
some
extent
although
i
don’t
know
what
the
value
of
it
is,
if
you
allow
litigation
of
a
counterclaim
and
you
do
not
give
effect
to
it
in
a
usual
manner.
there
is
no
indication
we
submit
in
the
act
of
congress
of
any
intent
to
treat
a
counterclaim
in
this
situation,
otherwise
then
as
a
usual
regular
and
typical
counterclaim
and
we
don’t
think
that
the
bar
against
the
set
off
is
a
bar
against
litigation
of
this
sort.
now,
from
a
policy
point
of
view
i
suppose
we
are
concerned
about
discrimination,
discriminating
against
various
classes
of
creditors.
but
i
think,
your
honors,
that
discrimination
is
the
root
of
the
judicial
process
because
as
jurists
and
as
lawyers,
we
discriminate
when
we
try
to
separate
the
relevant
from
the
irrelevant
facts
in
every
situation
and
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
situation
in
this
particular
case
when
we
see
the
congressional
intent
in
section
77
(j),
i
don’t
think
that
the
result
is
an
outrageous
result.
i
think
that
the
courts
below
did
substantial
justice
in
this
case
because
we
were
not
typical
creditors.
we
were
not
customers
of
this
railroad
profiting
by
our
business
dealings
with
them.
we
were
the
patrons
of
this
railroad.
my
client
along
with
many,
many
others
made
this
railroad
run
by
giving
it
business
and
the
more
business
we
gave
that
up
to
the
end,
the
more
we
were
injured.
and
i
think
basically
that
in
the
suit
--
that
the
courts
below
did
the
proper
thing.
i
checked
myself
because
i
was
concerned
keeping
in
mind
the
lowden
record,
the
records
of
the
courts
of
the
principle
center
in
the
seventh
circuit,
those
in
illinois,
in
cook
county,
illinois
and
i
found
the
total
of
only
three
cases
where
there
were
counterclaims
filed.
none
particularly
pleaded
in
detail,
one
in
the
state
court,
two
in
the
federal
court
of
which
one
is
being
removed.
there
is
no
plethora
of
cases
that
would
cause
a
problem
to
these
trustees
in
the
administration
of
the
railroad.
it
isn’t
the
existence
of
cases
like
this
involving
a
little
company
that
have
brought
the
railroad
to
the
past
that
it
is
right
now
where
it
may
not
even
be
reorganizable,
but
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
decisions
are
correct.
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
prior
to
courts
sustain
our
position
and
a
reading
of
the
orders
themselves
would
indicate
that
they
were
not
intended
to
have
the
fact
urged
by
counsel
in
that.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
basic
question
that
runs
through
the
entire
thread
of
this
case
is
exactly
how
much
power
judge
fullam
has,
sitting
in
philadelphia
by
his
orders
to
control
the
disposition
of
litigation
in
illinois
and
actually
by
examining
the
text
of
those
orders
what
he
actually
intended
to
do.
coming
first
to
the
most
important
point
the
matter
of
jurisdiction,
there
was
no
question
that
the
court
of
bankruptcy
under
section
77
(a)
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
all
of
the
debtor’s
property
at
the
time
of
the
filling
of
the
petition,
but
we
contend
that
this
shows
an
action
was
not
such
property.
we
say
there
was
no
actual
possession.
there
was
no
constructive
possession.
there
was
in
fact
to
substantial
adverse
claim
because
this
railroad
owed
this
company
almost
two-and-a-half
times
the
amount
they
claimed
and
it
being
an
adverse
claim,
could
be
subject
to
disposition
only
by
plenary
jurisdiction,
by
a
plenary
suit
which
the
trustees
did
commence.
we
state
further
that
at
this
time
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
no
summary
jurisdiction
at
any
time
over
gold
seal
liquors.
we
were
outside
the
jurisdiction.
we
didn’t
even
file
a
claim
the
trustees
recorded
from
the
books
that
they
have
the
amount
that
was
owed
us
and
advice
us
by
notice
that
a
claim
was
noted
in
the
amount
and
in
an
approximate
amount
as
to
what
we
had.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
well,
we
didn’t
file
a
claim
in
the
reorganization,
your
honor
because
we
saw
the
lawsuit
coming
and
because
frankly,
we
were
concerned
as
to
what
the
effect
of
participating
in
philadelphia
would
be.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
your
honor,
what
they
did
is
they
sent
a
notice
if
we
look
at
the
genesis
of
the
lawsuit,
the
suit
was
filed
in
the
end
of
1970.
under
date
of
february
1,
1971
to
which
was
appended
a
statement
of
the

as
of
march

a

which
was
received
by
my

i

mr.
theodore
j.
herst
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
because
we
filed
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
i
see
what
you

mr.

in

amount.
mr.

herst
that
is

that
is
correct
and
the
amount
was
also
different.
the
amount
shown
on
this
claim
is
different
than
the
amount
we
originally
claimed
and
the
amount
that
counsel
and
i
subsequently
thrashed
out
which
was
embodied
in
the
stipulation
as
the
actual
amount.
mr.

mr.

mr.
justice
stewart
we
completely
--
actually
claimed
close
to
$20,000.00,
$19,000.00
in
some
figure.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
yes.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
from
the
trustees.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
no,
they
say
it
does
not
constitute
an
admission,
but
they
simply
state
to
notify
us
that
the
attached
described
claims
and
it’s
actually
their
statement
of
account
have
been
presented
by
us,
have
been
presented
by
you
to
the
debtor
because
we’ve
made
the
claims
under
the
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
prior
to
reorganization
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
a
claim
on
the
bill
of
lading,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
yes,
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
in
that
amount,
i
suppose
that
is
the
only
way
you
could
regard
it.
now,
but
secondly
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
it
was
not
agreed.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
i
suppose
if
we
would
walk
away
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
mean
there
are
a
lot
of
ifs
mr.
justice
white,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question.
if
we
wanted
--
if
we
assumed
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
solvent
situation,
if
we
assume
that
we
sooner
or
later
might
get
something
if
we
were
satisfied
with
the
approximate
figure
all
other
things
being
considered
i
assume
we
could
walk
away
and
do
nothing
and
in
the
ordinary
course
just
watch
it.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
secondly,
we
believe
continuing
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
sir?
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
that
is
correct.
and
in
this
particular
case
mr.
chief
justice,
we
never
even
thought
of
the
taking
the
first
step
because
we
were
being
sued.
by
the
time
we
got
this
notice
we
were
in
the
district
court
in
illinois.
we
had
reached
the
pleading
stage.
we
were
litigating
so,
we
never
would
have
gone
into
--
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
right,
whatever
the
results
would
be
of
the
lawsuit
would
in
effect
be
our
claim
and
therefore
our
claim
in
effect
by
the
lawsuit
has
been
reduced
to
$11,000.00.
secondly,
i
just
think
that
this
is
unwarranted
extension
of
attempted
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
reorganization
court
but
i
don’t
think
the
reorganization
court
intended
so
do.
there
were
two
orders
which
we
would
have
before
us.
the
first
order
to
examine
is
order
number
1
entered
by
judge
kraft
in
june
of
1970.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
your
honor,
that
order
is
found
in
the
appendix
at
page
a22
and
following.
that
order
is
what
might
be
called
a
typical
stock
order
if
there’ll
be
such
because
it’s
the
usual
order
that
has
been
entered
in
railroad
reorganization
cases
and
the
paragraphs
conform
to
the
statutory
language.
the
key
paragraphs
for
this
purpose
would
be
found
at
page
831
paragraphs
9
and
10.
these
are
found
in
most
reorganization
cases.
the
first
one
to
maintain
the
status
quo
is
an
injunction
against
interfering
with
a
property
of
the
debtor
by
garnishment,
by
levying,
by
interfering
with
liens
and
in
our
opinion
against
voluntary
set
offs
because
all
of
the
cases
urged
by
the
trustees
in
the
courts
below
concerning
this
question
involved
voluntary
set
offs,
actions
of
self-help,
some
in
aggregative
circumstances.
in
the
susquehanna
case
the
court
noted
that
what
had
happened
was
that
the
bank
by
appropriating
deposit
balances
had
seized
the
operating
cash
to
the
railroad,
equitable
principles
again.
justice
cardozo’s
rule
in
lowden
whether
or
not
68
should
apply.
obviously,
in
susquehanna
from
the
facts,
it
shouldn’t
have
applied
and
didn’t.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
exactly,
lowden
was
a
loose
case.
in
effect
three
questions
were
asked
and
justice
cardozo
said
the
first
two
are
general
and
then
explaining
why
they
were
general,
he
said,
that
you
would
have
to
have
a
very
flexible
rule.
mr.
theodore
j.
herst
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
order
571,
the
second
order
that
i
would
allude
to
entered
in
the
summer
of
1972
by
judge
fullam.
these
involved
shippers
doing
things
by
themselves
setting
off
their
own
claims
or
alleging
the
existence
of
prior
contractual
arrangements
with
a
debtor
which
would
allow
them
to
set
off
unilaterally.
there
was
no
instance
in
that
case
of
judicial
action
and
i
don’t
think
that
judge
fullam
should
be
accused
any,
not
that
he
is,
but
even
considered
to
have
intended
that
because
in
his
order
571
which
is
found
at
page
1
(a)
of
our
blue
covered
brief,
he
extends
his
orders
to
all
persons,
firms
and
corporations
served
with
a
copy
of
the
petition
and
we
were
never
served,
and
he
prohibits
them
from
setting
off
or
attempting
to
set
off
obligations.
we
humbly
suggest
and
submit
that
the
litigation
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
of
a
compulsory
counterclaim
and
a
plenary
suit
is
not
the
type
of
thing
that
judge
fullam
was
talking
about
in
order
571.
if
we
want
to
find
out
what
congress
actually
intended
in
the
legislation,
i
frankly
have
had
not
too
much
success
in
looking
over
the
reports
of
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
shared
by
representative
summers
on
the
subcommittee
on
bankruptcy,
headed
by
mr.
walter
chandler
about
the
time
that
section
77
was
amended
in
1935
and
subsequent.
we
find
much
material
on
the
modification
of
security
interests,
the
amount
of
consent
necessary
to
implement
a
plan,
the
need
for
railroad
reorganization
legislation
to
supplant
the
vices
of
equity
receiverships,
but
nothing
on
this
one
question,
but
we
do
see
one
interesting
thing,
one
indication
of
congressional
intent.
we
find
first
in
section
77
(l),
sub-paragraph
(l)
of
section
77,
the
statement
of
the
courts
in
reorganization
of
all
the
powers
of
district
courts
sitting
in
bankruptcy.
the
creditor’s
rights
are
the
same.
the
court’s
powers
are
the
same
and
secondly
in
section
77
(j),
we
find
the
proviso
so
to
the
effect
that
the
courts
are
precluded
from
enjoining
actions
arising
out
of
the
operation
of
the
railroads.
this
proviso
was
reflected
on
a
typical
order
in
the
single
appendix
at
page
831,
lines
18
to
21
of
paragraph
9,
down
to
near
the
bottom.
the
court
reflects
the
statutory
mandate
which
has
provided
it
suits
or
claims
for
damages
caused
by
the
operation
of
trains,
etcetera
may
be
prosecuted
the
judgment
at
state.
and
the
michigan
court
recognized
that
to
some
extent
although
i
don’t
know
what
the
value
of
it
is,
if
you
allow
litigation
of
a
counterclaim
and
you
do
not
give
effect
to
it
in
a
usual
manner.
there
is
no
indication
we
submit
in
the
act
of
congress
of
any
intent
to
treat
a
counterclaim
in
this
situation,
otherwise
then
as
a
usual
regular
and
typical
counterclaim
and
we
don’t
think
that
the
bar
against
the
set
off
is
a
bar
against
litigation
of
this
sort.
now,
from
a
policy
point
of
view
i
suppose
we
are
concerned
about
discrimination,
discriminating
against
various
classes
of
creditors.
but
i
think,
your
honors,
that
discrimination
is
the
root
of
the
judicial
process
because
as
jurists
and
as
lawyers,
we
discriminate
when
we
try
to
separate
the
relevant
from
the
irrelevant
facts
in
every
situation
and
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
situation
in
this
particular
case
when
we
see
the
congressional
intent
in
section
77
(j),
i
don’t
think
that
the
result
is
an
outrageous
result.
i
think
that
the
courts
below
did
substantial
justice
in
this
case
because
we
were
not
typical
creditors.
we
were
not
customers
of
this
railroad
profiting
by
our
business
dealings
with
them.
we
were
the
patrons
of
this
railroad.
my
client
along
with
many,
many
others
made
this
railroad
run
by
giving
it
business
and
the
more
business
we
gave
that
up
to
the
end,
the
more
we
were
injured.
and
i
think
basically
that
in
the
suit
--
that
the
courts
below
did
the
proper
thing.
i
checked
myself
because
i
was
concerned
keeping
in
mind
the
lowden
record,
the
records
of
the
courts
of
the
principle
center
in
the
seventh
circuit,
those
in
illinois,
in
cook
county,
illinois
and
i
found
the
total
of
only
three
cases
where
there
were
counterclaims
filed.
none
particularly
pleaded
in
detail,
one
in
the
state
court,
two
in
the
federal
court
of
which
one
is
being
removed.
there
is
no
plethora
of
cases
that
would
cause
a
problem
to
these
trustees
in
the
administration
of
the
railroad.
it
isn’t
the
existence
of
cases
like
this
involving
a
little
company
that
have
brought
the
railroad
to
the
past
that
it
is
right
now
where
it
may
not
even
be
reorganizable,
but
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
decisions
are
correct.
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
prior
to
courts
sustain
our
position
and
a
reading
of
the
orders
themselves
would
indicate
that
they
were
not
intended
to
have
the
fact
urged
by
counsel
in
that.
