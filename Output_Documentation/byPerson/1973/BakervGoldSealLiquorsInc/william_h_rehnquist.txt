what
do
you
concede
to
be
property
of
the
debtor
that
was
here
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
do
you
disagree
with
judge
friendly’s
treatment
as
the
concept
of
property
and
in
lehigh
and
hudson
case
and
judge
hand’s
language
in
the
roman
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what’s
they’re
talking
about
there
is
that
what
is
the
property
of
the
bankrupt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
would
think
the
--
whether
when
the
particular
amount
occurred
wouldn’t
have
too
much
role
than
so
far
as
there
definition
is
concerned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
deals
with
the
summary
of
jurisdiction
in
the
bankruptcy
court
rather
than
a
plenary
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
bankruptcy
court
has
the
authority
to
tell
the
trustees
that
you
can
go
into
any
district
court
in
the
country
and
sue
and
i
am
going
to
immunize
you
against
the
normal
consequences
of
litigation
in
that
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
there
were
concededly
happened
in
straight
bankruptcy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
policy
against
preferences
is
just
as
strong
in
straight
bankruptcy
as
it
in
reorganizations,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
it
in
the
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
lowden
itself
was
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
the
bank
in
minnesota
had
on
its
own
initiative
set
off
against
the

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
get
them
account
sometimes
when
he
is
auditing
in
your
potential
claimant,
you
just
want
to
verify
really
the
