mr.
paul
r.
duke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
single
somewhat
simple
issue
which
briefly
stated
is
whether
or
not
a
district
court
has
the
power
to
enter
a
net
judgment
in
a
plenary
action
brought
by
the
trustees
of
a
railroad
in
reorganization
to
collect
pre-reorganization
freight
charges
and
in
which
action
the
defendant
has
counterclaimed
for
pre-reorganization
loss
or
damage
to
freight
when
the
court
supervising
the
reorganization
of
the
debtor
railroad
has
not
permitted
to
set
off
for
any
other
payment
of
such
claims
for
loss
or
damage.
the
record
in
this
case
is
also
relevantly
simple
and
consists
almost
entirely
of
a
stipulation.
very
briefly,
the
penn
central
trustees
whose
property
had
entered
reorganization
in
june
of
1970,
pursuant
to
a
direction
in
the
initial
order
in
that
reorganization
to
go
out
and
collect
the
property
of
the
debtor
wherever
they
could
find
it,
sued
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
to
collect
some
eighty-two
hundred
and
some
odd
dollars
in
freight
charges.
the
defendant
gold
seal
liquors
filed
an
answer
which
was
essentially
a
general
denial
but
also
filed
a
counterclaim
for
some
nineteen
thousand
and
some
dollars
in
loss
or
damage
to
shipments
all
of
which
occurred
prior
to
the
reorganization.
there
was
thereafter
a
stipulation
between
the
trustees
and
the
defendant
gold
seal.
gold
seal
admitted
its
liability
on
freight
charges
in
some
sixty-nine
hundred
and
ninety-nine
dollars
and
some
odd
cents
and
the
trustees
acknowledged
liability
on
this
pre-reorganization
loss
and
damage
claims
in
some
eighteen
thousand
some
odd
dollars.
the
trustees
then
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
they
asked
the
district
court
to
enter
separate
judgments
in
the
respective
amounts,
one
on
behalf
of
the
trustees
for
their
$69.99
and
one
for
gold
seal
for
their
$18,000.00.
the
district
court
indicated
that
it
didn’t
believe
that
it
had
been
cited
any
authority
which
would
justify
the
entry
of
separate
judgments,
but
concluded
that
in
any
event
it
would
be
inequitable
to
enter
a
separate
judgment
so
it
entered
a
single
net
judgment.
the
trustees
thereafter
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
it
thought
the
matter
that
was
presented
to
it
was
one
of
judicial
comity
and
went
on
to
say
that
the
matter
of
the
adjudication
of
the
claims
in
illinois
court
was
a
matter
of
law.
it
said
the
satisfaction
of
the
resulting
judgment
is
subject
to
the
equitable
principles
generally
applicable
in
a
court
of
bankruptcy
and
then
directed
that
the
resulting
judgment
be
filed
with
the
reorganization
court
for
proof
and
allowance.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
you’re
right,
your
honor,
that’s
the
trouble.
once
it
said
resulting
judgment
to
say
that
the
satisfaction
of
the
resulting
judgment
is
for
the
reorganization
court
to
me
begs
the
question
because
by
affirming
the
net
judgment
they’d
already
satisfied
seven-eighteenths
of
gold
seal’s
claim.
i
think
it
can
best
be
seen
if
gold
seal
had
sued
the
trustees
for
$19,000.00
in
pre-reorganization
loss
and
damage
claims,
the
trustees
defended
and
succeeded
in
showing
it
was
only
$18,000.00,
unlike
anyone
would
contend
that
the
illinois
district
court
could
take
$7,000.00
of
the
trustees
property
which
it
could
lay
hands
on
in
chicago
apply
it
in
partial
payment
of
that
judgment
and
then
they'll
say
as
to
the
remainder
you
have
to
file
that
in
philadelphia
and
collect
your
$11,000.00.
we
submit
that
that
was
the
basic
error.
we
believe
it’s
probably
clear
that
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
confers
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
reorganization
court
for
the
disposition
of
the
property
which
becomes
into
its
possession
and
also
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
payment
of
pre-reorganization
claims.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
this
shows
as
an
action,
your
honor,
for
freight
charges
which
came
into
their
possession
on
june
21,
1970.
now,
admittedly
they
were
not
liquidated,
at
that
time.
we
say
that
plenary
action
in
the
illinois
district
court
liquidated
those
and
admitted
amount
of
some
almost
24
twenty-fourth
cents
to
$7,000.00.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well,
if
your
honor
please
in
re
roman
it
was
a
straight
bankruptcy
case
where
there
is
no
right
of
set
off
and
i
think
judge
friendly’s
discussion
in
lehigh
and
hudson
river
distinguished
it.
but
you
see
in
lehigh
and
hudson
river,
your
honor,
the
set
off
of
was
accomplished
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
order
putting
lehigh
and
hudson
river
in
reorganization.
in
other
words,
in
that
case
they
went
in
on
april,
i
forget
16
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well,
i
think
it
will
not
your
honor
to
the
extent
that
it
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not,
if
you
have
effectuated
to
set
off
to
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
order
boring
set
offs,
you
may
have
raised
to
substantial
adverse
claim
to
the
property
and
i
say
that’s
the
essential
holding
of
lehigh
and
hudson
river.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right.
and
here
the
plenary
action
sought
to
enforce
these
shows
as
an
action,
i.e.
the
right
to
collect
for
these
freight
charges
which
came
into
the
proper
--
it
came
into
the
possession
of
the
debtor
and
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
reorganization
court
when
the
trustees
--
when
the
penn-central
entered
reorganization.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no,
i
think
--
well,
the
normal
consequences
of
litigation
your
honor,
i
say,
do
not
mean
under
77
that
the
trustees
have
to
risk
their
property,
risk
that
a
illinios
district
court
will
order
the
payment
of
these
claims
by
netting
out
this
judgment
simply
because
they
go
to
collect
their
property.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
your
honor,
that’s
a
tougher
question
obviously.
in
lyn
bell
which
is
the
original
authority
for
in
effect
having
counterclaims
where
damage
is
litigated
in
freight
charges
actions
is
not
clear.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
set
off
at
one
point
and
in
other
terms
of
counterclaim.
but
the
law
appears
to
be
clear
that
a
counterclaim
for
loss
and
damage
or
a
claim
for
loss
and
damage,
let’s
not
characterize
what
it
is,
is
not
a
defense
to
the
trustee’s
action
for
freight
charges.
it
is
a
separate
independent
claim
which
for
reasons
of
judicial
economy
and
efficiency
can
be
litigated
and
prosecuted
the
judgment
in
the
same
action.
now,
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
normally,
when
you
have
these
two
separate
judgments
which
liquidate
these
two
independent
claims,
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
net
them
out
and
enter
a
judgment.
we
say
the
intervention
of
reorganization
and
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
which
section
77
(a)
vests
in
a
reorganization
court,
for
the
payment
of
claims
and
over
property
of
the
debtor?
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no,
it
was
not
liquidated,
it
was
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
and
it
is
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
court
supervising
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
we
did
not
contest
the
jurisdiction
to
litigate
the
claims
on
the
lower
court.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right,
your
honor.
and
your
honors
already
indicate
our
second
point
which
is
that
through
the
procedure
followed
by
the
district
court
here.
this
one
loss
and
damage
claimant
has
gotten
payment
on
his
claim
as
contrasted
with
all
other
loss
and
damage
claims,
it's
including
loss
and
damage
claimants
who
are
brought
in
before
judge
fullam
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
oh,
no
question
about
it
your
honor.
but
section
68
gives
an
automatic
right
to
set
off
in
straight
bankruptcy
but
in
a
reorganization
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
except
your
honor
that
congress
has
in
effect
granted
that
preference
to
section
68.
here
it’s
a
court
of
equity
where
it’s
been
held
that
it’s
a
matter
of
discretion
through
reorganization
court
and
i
should
make
clear
that
reorganization
court
in
denying
set
off
of
up
to
now
for
this
type
of
claimant
has
not
done
so
forever
and
a
day.
he
said,
“it’s
without
prejudice
to
your
claiming
priority
when
we
get
to
the
proof
and
allowance
to
claims.”
i
would
finally
suggest
to
your
honors
that
there
is
another
case
quite
similar
to
this
one
which
arose
out
of
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
where
we
have
appended
that
opinion
has
been
addendum
to
our
brief.
we
think
it
provides
excellent
evidence
of
the
proper
method
for
handling
such
problems.
in
that
matter
of
suit
for
freight
charges
counterclaims
for
damages,
admittedly
the
court
could
not
enter
judgment
on
the
counterclaim
because
it
was
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
there
were
questions
of
law
and
fact
raised,
but
that
court
indicated
what
enters
judgment
for
the
trustees
on
their
claim
for
freight
charges,
but
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
the
reorganization
court
prevented
it
from
satisfying
any
judgment
that
it
ultimately
entered
on
the
counterclaim
for
loss
of
damage
out
of
the
property
that
arose
of
the
trustees
including
the
proceeds
of
this
judgment.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know,
it
has
not
yet
although
there
have
been
indications
that
it
will
be.
i
like
to
reserve
additional
time
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that
established
your
honor,
the
jurisdiction
to
bring
our
action.
the
relevancy
of
those
sections
as
discussed
in
some
of
the
opinions
we
cite
was
whether
or
not
a
shipper
could
have
effectuated
the
extinguishment
of
the
trustees
claims
for
freight
charges
with
a
non-judicial
netting
of
freight
charges
against
loss
and
damage
claim
against
freight
charge.
the
third
circuit
in
the
--
what
we
have
described
as
the
shipper
set
off
case
in
this
reorganization,
affirmed
an
opinion
by
a
judgment
by
judge
fullam
that
such
a
netting
out
could
not
occur.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
because
the
requirement
of
section
67
your
honor
that
freight
charges
be
paid
in
cash
and
that
all
shippers
pay
in
the
same
form
prevented
any
--
and
the
general
policy
of
the
act
against
secret
rebates
and
secret
arrangements
prevented
the
shipper
from
--
any
railroad
from
agreeing
off
the
record
or
outside
the
confines
of
a
judicial
proceeding
that
they
would
net
out
their
freight
charges
in
loss
and
damage
claims.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right
your
honor,
and
it
did
not
occur
pre-reorganization.
what
we
have
here
is
litigation
which
established
our
right
to
$7,000.00
that’s
clear.
litigation
which
liquidated
his
claims
at
$18,000.00
and
then
the
court
took
the
one
claim,
that
it
did
them
separately
and
so
it
entered
net
judgment
for
eleven.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
one
or
two
things
your
honor,
and
of
course
a
number
of
suits
is
not
of
record.
we
find
it
difficult
to
understand
to
check
mr.
herst
made
cause
there
are
more
than
three.
there
are
at
least
20
or
25
and
in
chicago
alone
counterclaims
pleaded
amount
to
about
$850,000.00
that
does
not
include
other
places
in
the
seventh
circuit.
what
is
of
record
is
that
in
the
reorganization
proceeding
is
a
part
of
the
stipulation.
it
is
agreed
or
in
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
motion
that
at
the
time
of
that
motion
there
were
some
9600
claimants,
separate
claimants
with
loss
and
damage
claims
in
this
reorganization
who
had
filed
loss
and
damage
claims
in
an
amount
of
approximately
$29,600,000.00.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
your
honor,
the
procedure
to
which
mr.
herst,
the
notice
which
he
received
was
a
notice
prescribed
by
judge
fullam
pursuant
to
order
164.
this
is
a
big
reorganization
and
to
try
to
get
everybody
to
file.
so,
what
they
did,
what
mr.
herst
got
and
that’s
referred
to
in
the
stipulation
also,
was
a
notice
saying,
“look,
here’s
what
we
got
on
file
for
you.
we
got
about
$17,000.00
worth
of
loss
and
damage
claims
we’ve
have
already
proofs.
we
have
got
another
couple
of
thousands
under
investigation.
if
you
don’t
agree
with
that,
you
file
a
proof
of
claim
right
in
we’ll
give
you
the
papers
you
file
the
proof
of
claim.
but
unlike
you
--”
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right.
but
it
is
unusual
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
this
extent.
we
indicated
to
him
that
you’ve
got
a
couple
of
thousand,
we
haven’t
finished
investigating
yet.
we
may
allow
those,
we
might
not
allow
them
we’ll
notify
you
when
we
get
finished.
of
course,
when
we
finished
and
notify
them
if
we
disallowed
then
you
would
then
have
an
opportunity.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
the
amount
that
we
have
approved,
your
honor.
we
hadn’t
allowed
it.
it
begins
by
saying
we
don’t
admit
these
amounts,
the
total
amounts
but
here
is
the
way
it
breaks
down.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
oh,
we
have
to.
if
we
ever
get
to
him.
i
mean,
if
we
ever
get
to
unsecured
creditor,
sure
allow.
as
to
$7,000.00,
the
result
of
the
entry
the
net
judgment
is
he’s
gotten
paid
seven-eighteenth
to
his
claim.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
single
somewhat
simple
issue
which
briefly
stated
is
whether
or
not
a
district
court
has
the
power
to
enter
a
net
judgment
in
a
plenary
action
brought
by
the
trustees
of
a
railroad
in
reorganization
to
collect
pre-reorganization
freight
charges
and
in
which
action
the
defendant
has
counterclaimed
for
pre-reorganization
loss
or
damage
to
freight
when
the
court
supervising
the
reorganization
of
the
debtor
railroad
has
not
permitted
to
set
off
for
any
other
payment
of
such
claims
for
loss
or
damage.
the
record
in
this
case
is
also
relevantly
simple
and
consists
almost
entirely
of
a
stipulation.
very
briefly,
the
penn
central
trustees
whose
property
had
entered
reorganization
in
june
of
1970,
pursuant
to
a
direction
in
the
initial
order
in
that
reorganization
to
go
out
and
collect
the
property
of
the
debtor
wherever
they
could
find
it,
sued
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
to
collect
some
eighty-two
hundred
and
some
odd
dollars
in
freight
charges.
the
defendant
gold
seal
liquors
filed
an
answer
which
was
essentially
a
general
denial
but
also
filed
a
counterclaim
for
some
nineteen
thousand
and
some
dollars
in
loss
or
damage
to
shipments
all
of
which
occurred
prior
to
the
reorganization.
there
was
thereafter
a
stipulation
between
the
trustees
and
the
defendant
gold
seal.
gold
seal
admitted
its
liability
on
freight
charges
in
some
sixty-nine
hundred
and
ninety-nine
dollars
and
some
odd
cents
and
the
trustees
acknowledged
liability
on
this
pre-reorganization
loss
and
damage
claims
in
some
eighteen
thousand
some
odd
dollars.
the
trustees
then
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
they
asked
the
district
court
to
enter
separate
judgments
in
the
respective
amounts,
one
on
behalf
of
the
trustees
for
their
$69.99
and
one
for
gold
seal
for
their
$18,000.00.
the
district
court
indicated
that
it
didn’t
believe
that
it
had
been
cited
any
authority
which
would
justify
the
entry
of
separate
judgments,
but
concluded
that
in
any
event
it
would
be
inequitable
to
enter
a
separate
judgment
so
it
entered
a
single
net
judgment.
the
trustees
thereafter
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
it
thought
the
matter
that
was
presented
to
it
was
one
of
judicial
comity
and
went
on
to
say
that
the
matter
of
the
adjudication
of
the
claims
in
illinois
court
was
a
matter
of
law.
it
said
the
satisfaction
of
the
resulting
judgment
is
subject
to
the
equitable
principles
generally
applicable
in
a
court
of
bankruptcy
and
then
directed
that
the
resulting
judgment
be
filed
with
the
reorganization
court
for
proof
and
allowance.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
you’re
right,
your
honor,
that’s
the
trouble.
once
it
said
resulting
judgment
to
say
that
the
satisfaction
of
the
resulting
judgment
is
for
the
reorganization
court
to
me
begs
the
question
because
by
affirming
the
net
judgment
they’d
already
satisfied
seven-eighteenths
of
gold
seal’s
claim.
i
think
it
can
best
be
seen
if
gold
seal
had
sued
the
trustees
for
$19,000.00
in
pre-reorganization
loss
and
damage
claims,
the
trustees
defended
and
succeeded
in
showing
it
was
only
$18,000.00,
unlike
anyone
would
contend
that
the
illinois
district
court
could
take
$7,000.00
of
the
trustees
property
which
it
could
lay
hands
on
in
chicago
apply
it
in
partial
payment
of
that
judgment
and
then
they'll
say
as
to
the
remainder
you
have
to
file
that
in
philadelphia
and
collect
your
$11,000.00.
we
submit
that
that
was
the
basic
error.
we
believe
it’s
probably
clear
that
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act
confers
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
reorganization
court
for
the
disposition
of
the
property
which
becomes
into
its
possession
and
also
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
payment
of
pre-reorganization
claims.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
this
shows
as
an
action,
your
honor,
for
freight
charges
which
came
into
their
possession
on
june
21,
1970.
now,
admittedly
they
were
not
liquidated,
at
that
time.
we
say
that
plenary
action
in
the
illinois
district
court
liquidated
those
and
admitted
amount
of
some
almost
24
twenty-fourth
cents
to
$7,000.00.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well,
if
your
honor
please
in
re
roman
it
was
a
straight
bankruptcy
case
where
there
is
no
right
of
set
off
and
i
think
judge
friendly’s
discussion
in
lehigh
and
hudson
river
distinguished
it.
but
you
see
in
lehigh
and
hudson
river,
your
honor,
the
set
off
of
was
accomplished
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
order
putting
lehigh
and
hudson
river
in
reorganization.
in
other
words,
in
that
case
they
went
in
on
april,
i
forget
16
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
well,
i
think
it
will
not
your
honor
to
the
extent
that
it
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not,
if
you
have
effectuated
to
set
off
to
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
order
boring
set
offs,
you
may
have
raised
to
substantial
adverse
claim
to
the
property
and
i
say
that’s
the
essential
holding
of
lehigh
and
hudson
river.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right.
and
here
the
plenary
action
sought
to
enforce
these
shows
as
an
action,
i.e.
the
right
to
collect
for
these
freight
charges
which
came
into
the
proper
--
it
came
into
the
possession
of
the
debtor
and
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
reorganization
court
when
the
trustees
--
when
the
penn-central
entered
reorganization.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no,
i
think
--
well,
the
normal
consequences
of
litigation
your
honor,
i
say,
do
not
mean
under
77
that
the
trustees
have
to
risk
their
property,
risk
that
a
illinios
district
court
will
order
the
payment
of
these
claims
by
netting
out
this
judgment
simply
because
they
go
to
collect
their
property.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
your
honor,
that’s
a
tougher
question
obviously.
in
lyn
bell
which
is
the
original
authority
for
in
effect
having
counterclaims
where
damage
is
litigated
in
freight
charges
actions
is
not
clear.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
set
off
at
one
point
and
in
other
terms
of
counterclaim.
but
the
law
appears
to
be
clear
that
a
counterclaim
for
loss
and
damage
or
a
claim
for
loss
and
damage,
let’s
not
characterize
what
it
is,
is
not
a
defense
to
the
trustee’s
action
for
freight
charges.
it
is
a
separate
independent
claim
which
for
reasons
of
judicial
economy
and
efficiency
can
be
litigated
and
prosecuted
the
judgment
in
the
same
action.
now,
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
normally,
when
you
have
these
two
separate
judgments
which
liquidate
these
two
independent
claims,
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
net
them
out
and
enter
a
judgment.
we
say
the
intervention
of
reorganization
and
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
which
section
77
(a)
vests
in
a
reorganization
court,
for
the
payment
of
claims
and
over
property
of
the
debtor?
mr.
paul
r.
duke
no,
it
was
not
liquidated,
it
was
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
and
it
is
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
court
supervising
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
we
did
not
contest
the
jurisdiction
to
litigate
the
claims
on
the
lower
court.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right,
your
honor.
and
your
honors
already
indicate
our
second
point
which
is
that
through
the
procedure
followed
by
the
district
court
here.
this
one
loss
and
damage
claimant
has
gotten
payment
on
his
claim
as
contrasted
with
all
other
loss
and
damage
claims,
it's
including
loss
and
damage
claimants
who
are
brought
in
before
judge
fullam
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
oh,
no
question
about
it
your
honor.
but
section
68
gives
an
automatic
right
to
set
off
in
straight
bankruptcy
but
in
a
reorganization
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
except
your
honor
that
congress
has
in
effect
granted
that
preference
to
section
68.
here
it’s
a
court
of
equity
where
it’s
been
held
that
it’s
a
matter
of
discretion
through
reorganization
court
and
i
should
make
clear
that
reorganization
court
in
denying
set
off
of
up
to
now
for
this
type
of
claimant
has
not
done
so
forever
and
a
day.
he
said,
“it’s
without
prejudice
to
your
claiming
priority
when
we
get
to
the
proof
and
allowance
to
claims.”
i
would
finally
suggest
to
your
honors
that
there
is
another
case
quite
similar
to
this
one
which
arose
out
of
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
where
we
have
appended
that
opinion
has
been
addendum
to
our
brief.
we
think
it
provides
excellent
evidence
of
the
proper
method
for
handling
such
problems.
in
that
matter
of
suit
for
freight
charges
counterclaims
for
damages,
admittedly
the
court
could
not
enter
judgment
on
the
counterclaim
because
it
was
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
there
were
questions
of
law
and
fact
raised,
but
that
court
indicated
what
enters
judgment
for
the
trustees
on
their
claim
for
freight
charges,
but
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
the
reorganization
court
prevented
it
from
satisfying
any
judgment
that
it
ultimately
entered
on
the
counterclaim
for
loss
of
damage
out
of
the
property
that
arose
of
the
trustees
including
the
proceeds
of
this
judgment.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know,
it
has
not
yet
although
there
have
been
indications
that
it
will
be.
i
like
to
reserve
additional
time
--
mr.
paul
r.
duke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that
established
your
honor,
the
jurisdiction
to
bring
our
action.
the
relevancy
of
those
sections
as
discussed
in
some
of
the
opinions
we
cite
was
whether
or
not
a
shipper
could
have
effectuated
the
extinguishment
of
the
trustees
claims
for
freight
charges
with
a
non-judicial
netting
of
freight
charges
against
loss
and
damage
claim
against
freight
charge.
the
third
circuit
in
the
--
what
we
have
described
as
the
shipper
set
off
case
in
this
reorganization,
affirmed
an
opinion
by
a
judgment
by
judge
fullam
that
such
a
netting
out
could
not
occur.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
because
the
requirement
of
section
67
your
honor
that
freight
charges
be
paid
in
cash
and
that
all
shippers
pay
in
the
same
form
prevented
any
--
and
the
general
policy
of
the
act
against
secret
rebates
and
secret
arrangements
prevented
the
shipper
from
--
any
railroad
from
agreeing
off
the
record
or
outside
the
confines
of
a
judicial
proceeding
that
they
would
net
out
their
freight
charges
in
loss
and
damage
claims.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right
your
honor,
and
it
did
not
occur
pre-reorganization.
what
we
have
here
is
litigation
which
established
our
right
to
$7,000.00
that’s
clear.
litigation
which
liquidated
his
claims
at
$18,000.00
and
then
the
court
took
the
one
claim,
that
it
did
them
separately
and
so
it
entered
net
judgment
for
eleven.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
one
or
two
things
your
honor,
and
of
course
a
number
of
suits
is
not
of
record.
we
find
it
difficult
to
understand
to
check
mr.
herst
made
cause
there
are
more
than
three.
there
are
at
least
20
or
25
and
in
chicago
alone
counterclaims
pleaded
amount
to
about
$850,000.00
that
does
not
include
other
places
in
the
seventh
circuit.
what
is
of
record
is
that
in
the
reorganization
proceeding
is
a
part
of
the
stipulation.
it
is
agreed
or
in
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
motion
that
at
the
time
of
that
motion
there
were
some
9600
claimants,
separate
claimants
with
loss
and
damage
claims
in
this
reorganization
who
had
filed
loss
and
damage
claims
in
an
amount
of
approximately
$29,600,000.00.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
your
honor,
the
procedure
to
which
mr.
herst,
the
notice
which
he
received
was
a
notice
prescribed
by
judge
fullam
pursuant
to
order
164.
this
is
a
big
reorganization
and
to
try
to
get
everybody
to
file.
so,
what
they
did,
what
mr.
herst
got
and
that’s
referred
to
in
the
stipulation
also,
was
a
notice
saying,
“look,
here’s
what
we
got
on
file
for
you.
we
got
about
$17,000.00
worth
of
loss
and
damage
claims
we’ve
have
already
proofs.
we
have
got
another
couple
of
thousands
under
investigation.
if
you
don’t
agree
with
that,
you
file
a
proof
of
claim
right
in
we’ll
give
you
the
papers
you
file
the
proof
of
claim.
but
unlike
you
--”
mr.
paul
r.
duke
that’s
right.
but
it
is
unusual
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
this
extent.
we
indicated
to
him
that
you’ve
got
a
couple
of
thousand,
we
haven’t
finished
investigating
yet.
we
may
allow
those,
we
might
not
allow
them
we’ll
notify
you
when
we
get
finished.
of
course,
when
we
finished
and
notify
them
if
we
disallowed
then
you
would
then
have
an
opportunity.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
the
amount
that
we
have
approved,
your
honor.
we
hadn’t
allowed
it.
it
begins
by
saying
we
don’t
admit
these
amounts,
the
total
amounts
but
here
is
the
way
it
breaks
down.
mr.
paul
r.
duke
oh,
we
have
to.
if
we
ever
get
to
him.
i
mean,
if
we
ever
get
to
unsecured
creditor,
sure
allow.
as
to
$7,000.00,
the
result
of
the
entry
the
net
judgment
is
he’s
gotten
paid
seven-eighteenth
to
his
claim.
