mr.
leo
h.
raines
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
blair
&
co.
was
one
of
the
larger
stockbrokers
in
new
york
and
it
apparently
ran
into
very
severe
financial
trouble
with
the
end
of
its
fiscal
year
of
1969.
and
it
appears
that
between
1969,
that
is
september
of
1969
and
september
of
1970,
they
gradually
liquidated
their
company
by
giving
away,
literally
giving
away
branches
of
their
stock
brokerage
concern
to
other
concerns,
to
which
some
of
their
employees
are
officers,
went
and
became
members
of.
they
paid
out
or
permitted
subordinated
debenture
holders
who
were
members
of
their
boards
of
directors
to
get
their
money
out
of
the
company.
and
late
in
september
of
1970,
they
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
new
york
stock
exchange
special
fund,
by
the
terms
of
which,
the
special
fund
was
permitted
to
appoint
a
person
as
a
liquidator
to
liquidate
blair
&
co.
and,
as
a
matter
of
form,
the
special
fund
loaned
$1,000
to
blair
&
co.
and
proceeded
to
appoint
a
man,
mr.
scorese,
as
a
liquidator
in
a
very
carefully
drawn
and
very
ornate
and
very
carefully
drafted
contract
in
which
his
powers
was
specifically
set
forth
and
in
a
power
of
attorney
which
clearly
set
forth
all
of
his
powers.
and
i
submit
to
you,
without
going
too
deeply
into
the
record,
that
there
isn’t
a
power
that
appears
in
the
contract
or
that
appears
in
the
power
of
attorney
that
differs
in
any
way
from
any
power
that
was
ever
given
to
any
receiver
or
any
trustee
that
was
ever
appointed
by
any
court
or
was
ever
appointed
by
any
insolvent
debtor.
he
was
given
greater
powers
than
a
receiver
because
he
didn’t
have
to
file
a
bond.
he
didn’t
have
to
apply
to
a
court
for
leave
to
sell
anything
or
to
dispose
off
anything.
and
what
is
most
important
as
distinguished
from
other
agents,
he
was
the
sole
judge
of
his
own
powers.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
he
had
no
greater
power.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
he
had
no
greater
power.
he
could
settle,
compromise,
dispose
or
pay
out
any
creditor’s
claim.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
it
could’ve
done
it,
yes,
just
as
it
could’ve.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
none
that
i
was
aware
of.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
don’t
quite
understand
your
question,
sir.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
now,
this
is
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
apparently,
the
position
taken
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
that
it
is
a
power
greater
than
the
court
because,
by
the
constitution
of
the
exchange
as
i
understand
it,
the
powers
were
limited
to
arbitration
within
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
very
petitioners
sought
to
rescind
their
contract.
because,
what
had
occurred
here
was
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
not
at
all.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
not
at
all,
sir.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
an
exchange
member
might
have,
but
my
clients
who
are
subordinated
creditors
were
in
an
extremely
difficult
position
because,
being
subordinated,
they
were
debenture
holders
who
put
their
money
in
on
a
subordinated
basis
at
a
time
when
the
insiders
had
already
taken
their
money
out.
and
in
order
for
my
client
to
go
into
court
and
to
sue
as
a
subordinated
creditor,
they
would’ve
been
faced
with
the
overwhelming
burden
of
having
to
establish,
firstly,
that
there
were
sufficient
assets
in
blair
&
co.
to
pay
all
of
the
un-subordinated
creditors
before
their
right
to
sue
would
arise.
now,
the
problem
in
that
case
that
before
they
could
proceed
with
such
a
suit,
before
they
could
proceed
with
a
proof
to
establish
their
right
to
bring
such
a
suit,
four
months
would
easily
have
elapsed.
within
which,
any
act
of
bankruptcy
such
as
preference,
fraudulent
conveyance
would’ve
expired.
we
were
confronted
with
a
very,
very
difficult
problem.
in
that,
we
found
on
practically
two
days
notice,
am
i
departing
from
your
question?
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
don’t
know.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
don’t
know
and
i
don’t
know
that
it
enters
into
by
problem.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
as
a
result
of
the
constitution
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
compelled
--
resort
to
the
procedures
within
the
exchange.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
this
is
the
great
problem
here.
i
don’t
know
that
it’s
authorized
by
statute.
it’s
authorized
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
where
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
permitted
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
other
acts
by
arrangements
with
the
commission.
i
do
know
that
these
petitioning
creditors
in
this
case,
when
they
sought
to
rescind
their
lending
to
blair
&
co.,
were
compelled
to
go
through
what
seemed
to
us
a
very
unfair
and
one-sided
arbitration
procedure.
the
basic
question
on
this
appeal,
lies
in
the
fact
that
within
four
or
five
days
of
the
appointment
of
the
liquidator
we
petitioned
blair
&
co.
into
bankruptcy.
we
cited
three
acts
of
bankruptcy,
two
of
which
were
eliminated
by
referee
herzog
and
were
not
pursued
in
as
much
as
he
held
in
our
favor
on
the
basic
issue
of
the
appointment
of
the
liquidator.
excuse
me.
our
position
was,
as
with
shakespeare,
that
a
rose
smells
as
sweet
no
matter
what
its
name
that
this
mr.
scorese,
although
named
as
a
liquidator
and
at
other
times
as
an
agent,
actually
came
within
the
intent
of
this
statute,
and
a
reading
of
the
history
of
this
statute
bears
this
out.
this
statute
was
first
enacted
in
the
bankruptcy
act
in
1903,
and
it
was
subsequently
amended
on
several
occasions
into
its
present
form.
and
throughout
the
several
amendments,
the
basic
expression
that
was
involved
here
was
the
doctrine
of
the
appointment
of
somebody
to
take
charge
of
a
liquidation.
this
was
the
essential
concept.
in
the
use
of
the
words
in
the
statute,
it
apparently
was
limited
to
a
receiver
or
a
trustee.
but,
at
the
time
this
petition
was
filed,
every
case,
every
text,
as
i’ve
cited
in
my
brief
before
this
court
which
i
won’t
bother
to
repeat
it,
held
that
a
liquidator
came
within
the
scope
of
this
statute.
it
could’ve
been
a
simple
thing
for
these
petitioning
creditors
to
have
gone
into
the
state
court
of
new
jersey
and
move
for
the
appointment
of
the
state
court
receiver,
and
then
file
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
which
would
have
clearly
come
under
section
3
(a)
(5)
of
the
act.
but
because
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
where
the
four-month
period
was
about
to
run
out
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
filed
it
on
the
last
day,
was
about
to
run
out
on
about
$3.5
million
worth
of
preferences.
based
upon
the
texts
and
upon
the
laws,
we
filed
it.
and
as
it
had
been
promulgated
to
that
date,
we
filed
the
petition
directly.
and
our
position
on
this
appeal
and
the
decision
of
referee
herzog
below
and
the
decision
of
judge
cooper
below
have
clearly
held
that
the
appointment
of
mr.
scorese
came
within
the
scope
of
section
3
(a)
(5)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
despite
the
fact
that,
in
their
wisdom,
the
attorneys
who
represented
blair
&
co.
or
the
new
york
stock
exchange
shows
to
denominate
and
designate
purely
as
a
matter
of
naming
mr.
scorese
not
as
a
trustee
which
he
actually
was,
not
as
a
receiver
which
he
actually
was,
but
as
a
liquidating
agent.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
will,
if
your
honor,
asked
me
this
question,
alright.
i
had
submitted
a
memorandum
on
the
question
of
mootness
and
i
was
prepared
to
argue
the
case
to
the
chief
rather
than
the
question
of
mootness.
the
chapter
11
proceeding
was
filed
as
a
result
of
the
filing
of
this
petition.
there
would’ve
been
no
chapter
11
if
we
had
not
filed
the
petition.
throughout
two
years,
there
was
the
threat
of
confirmation
of
the
chapter
11,
but
it
was
never
confirmed.
just
before
this
case
came
up
for
argument
on
october
2nd
,
the
most
amazing
order
of
confirmation
was
entered.
in
the
25
years
that
i
have
personally
practiced
before
the
bankruptcy
courts,
i
have
never
seen
such
an
order
of
confirmation
because
two-thirds
of
the
claims
which
are
supposed
to
be
taken
care
of
in
the
order
of
confirmation
are
reserved
for
later
litigation.
my
client
has
a
block
of
stock
that
is
worth
a
million
dollars
which
is
unregistered
and
cannot
be
transferred,
and
this
stock
is
being
held
in
limbo
and
is
going
to
be
the
subject
of
further
litigation.
we
have
already
made
a
motion
directed
to
this
order
of
confirmation.
we
did
not
know
the
order
was
entered.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
order
was
entered
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
in
the
practice
of
bankruptcy,
when
the
original
chapter
11
is
filed
the
referee
sends
out
a
notice
of
first
reading
and,
in
the
same
notice,
he
says
a
notice
of
date
of
confirmation
is
also
set.
this
date
was
set
two
years
ago,
and
it
is
constantly
postponed
and
postponed
and
postponed,
and
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
keep
up
with
every
single
adjournment
that
takes
place.
we
never
knew
when
the
hearing
on
confirmation
took
place.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
we
never
get
repeated
notices,
sir.
we
must
appear
on
every
occasion
and,
i
frankly
state,
i
don’t
have
the
staff
to
do
it.
we
must
appear
on
every
occasion,
make
a
note
of
every
adjournment.
and
then
on
the
one
particular
occasion
when
the
debtor,
he
likes
to
hold
his
hearing
on
the
question
of
feasibility
and
the
question
of
whether
the
settlement
is
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors,
they
simply
hold
it
and
then
they
submit
the
order
of
confirmation
to
the
referee
relatively
expired.
there
is
no
new
notice.
under
section
355
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
creditors
are
supposed
to
receive
a
notice
of
the
entry
of
an
order
of
confirmation.
but,
we
never
received
such
a
notice
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
sir?
mr.
leo
h.
raines
no,
sir.
we
did
not
know
that
it
was
entered.
we
have
made
a
motion
to
reconsider
the
order
of
confirmation,
but
it
is
only
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
before
referee
babbitt,
but
it
is
only
in
relation
to
our
particular
problem.
we
could
not
make
it
at
launch.
this
is
a
most
peculiar
chapter
11.
there
was
never
a
committee
of
creditors
appointed.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
would
still
contend
that
it’s
not
moot,
sir,
and
interestingly
enough,
in
one
of
the
cases
in
which
rely
heavily
in
my
approach
to
this
court,
bank
of
marin
against
england.
the
same
question
was
also
raised
as
to
whether
the
decision
was
moot.
now,
this
court
held
that
there
was
going
to
be
further
litigation
even
outside
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
and
there
will
be
further
litigation
in
this
case.
the
determination
of
what
happens
to
our
roger
stock
is
specifically
keyed
to
whether
or
not
there
is
going
to
be
an
adjudication
here.
by
an
exhibit,
which
i
attach
to
my
memorandum
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
i’m
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
direct
an
adjudication.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
yes,
the
chapter
11
order
of
confirmation
can
still
be
set
aside.
there
is
a
six-month
period
within
which
a
motion
can
be
made
to
set
aside
an
order
of
confirmation.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
sir?
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
the
adjudication
is
separate
from
the
order
of
confirmation.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
they
superseded
in
a
sense
that
they
set
it
aside.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
that’s
right.
they
do
not
dismiss
it.
the
problem
--
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
when
we
moved
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding,
early
in
the
proceeding,
referee
babbitt
held
up
the
decision
for
about
nine
or
ten
months.
and,
when
the
court
of
appeals
came
down
with
a
decision
reversing
the
court
below
and
vacating
the
order
of
adjudication,
in
part
of
his
decision
which
i
put
in
my
memorandum,
he
said
“i
can’t
dismiss
the
proceeding
now
because
if
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
order
of
adjudication,
this
court
would
lose
jurisdiction
of
this
case
and
it
would
be
sort
of
flowing
the
case
to
the
wolves.”
and,
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
referee
babbitt
gave
for
refusing
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
yes,
they
are
allowed
fees.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
that’s
a
question
before
referee
babbitt
from
which
there
might
be
some
disagreement.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
yes,
sir.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
he
is
still
entitled
to
fees.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
yes.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
the
adjudication
is
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
may
not
be.
i’m
not
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
this
is
one
of
the
elements
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
think
it
would
--
i
did
not
so
state
in
my
memorandum
because
i
felt
that
my
personal
affairs
is
of
no
concern
to
this
court.
but
in
as
much
as
your
honors
been
good
enough
to
raise
it,
it
certainly
is
one
of
the
elements
that
i’m
deeply
concerned.
and
also,
as
a
question
of
cost,
my
client
has
lost
$3
million
and
he
is
now
faced
with
a
bill
of
course
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
excess
of
$4,000.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
it’s
a
consideration.
it’s
an
element
of
consideration.
but,
basically,
the
reason
i
say
it
is
not
moot
is
because,
as
i
argued
in
my
memorandum
of
law
judge,
this
decision
on
judge
friendly’s
of
the
court
of
appeals
is,
in
my
opinion,
one
of
the
most
dangerous.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
it
could
be
moot
on
a
matter
of
theory,
but
it
isn’t
moot
because
there
is
much
litigation
that
is
still
to
follow
in
this
case.
and
the
question
of
adjudication
becomes
a
paramount
importance
in
this
subsequent
litigation.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
i
would
be
entitled
to
fees
as
attorney
for
petitioning
creditors
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
--
does
not
lapse.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
it
merely
is
set
aside.
it
is
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
that
is
my
opinion,
sir,
yes.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
there
are
cases
so
holding.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
i
can’t
answer
that
because
that
is
a
question
that
i
have
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
no,
i
know
of
no
case
that
holds
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
that
if
it
is
subsequently
not
adjudicated
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well
if
the
law
is,
then
i
get
it,
whether
it’s
adjudicated
or
not,
then
i’m
home
free.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
if
i
win.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
as
far
as
leo
raines
is
concerned,
it
is
a
very
important
and
non-moot.[laughter]
it
is
very
important.
i
have
rested,
if
i
may
go
back
to
my
case
in
chief,
i
have
rested
my
position
on
this
appeal,
as
i
did
below,
on
the
fact
that
this
court
has
ruled
to
get
it
again
on
basic
paramount
issues
that
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
federal
courts
have
paramount
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
liquidation
of
insolvent
estate.
based
upon
the
cases
of
the
bank
of
marin
against
england,
and
pepper
against
litton,
the
doctrine
that
substance
will
not
give
way
to
form
and
that
technical
considerations
will
not
prevent
substantial
justice
from
being
done.
now,
these
principles
were
followed
by
other
courts.
in
1941,
in
the
district
court
of
oklahoma,
a
petition
was
filed
which
was
technically
incorrect
and
the
court
itself,
in
rendering
its
opinion,
stated
that
it
had
very
serious
doubts
whether
technically
it
came
within
the
specific
scope
of
the
statute.
but
the
court
said
the
court
will
not
stand
on
a
technicality
with
reference
to
form
when
substance
is
alleged.
and
it
held,
that
despite
its
doubt
that
the
appointment
of
a
liquidator
by
contract
constituted
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
nonetheless
found
it
sufficient
to
constitute
an
act
of
bankruptcy.
now
this
case,
in
the
manner
of
r.v.
smith,
was
cited
in
talius
(ph),
cited
in
remington,
the
two
leading
text
on
the
subject,
as
the
guide
to
which
we
attorneys
follow.
and,
as
i’ve
cited
in
my
brief,
talius
specifically
said
in
so
many
words,
on
page
4
--
that
a
liquidating
trust
--
that
a
liquidator
appointed
by
contract
came
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
in
1953,
judge
winfield,
who
i’m
certain
your
honors
will
recognize
as
one
of
the
outstanding
jurists
on
the
question
of
bankruptcy,
wrote
a
landmark
decision
in
which
he
argued
--
in
which
he
stated,
if
i
may,
i’ve
cited
it
in
my
briefs,
again
following
the
principle
of
pepper
against
litton,
“it
is
not
required
that
the
transferee
of
the
property
be
formally
appointed
as
trustee
by
a
ceremonial
document
referring
to
him
as
such.
the
method
adopted
to
affect
the
transfer
is
immaterial.
it
is
the
end
result
that
counts.
any
action
by
one
who
is
insolvent
which
effectively
causes
the
transfer
of
his
property
to
another
for
final
liquidation
purposes
appoints
the
transferee
a
trustee
to
take
charge
of
his
property
under
section
3
subdivision
(a)
(5).
now,
this
is
the
point
we
make
here.
mr.
scorese,
whether
you
named
him
an
agent
or
a
liquidator,
a
trustee,
or
a
receiver
was
the
identical
person
given
the
identical
powers.
he
was
given
completely
in
charge
unlike
an
agent,
as
i’ve
cited
in
bogart
and
trusts,
unlike
an
agent,
he
had
no
responsibility
to
his
principle.
as
you
read
the
contract,
you
realize
that
he
was
the
sole
judge
of
his
own
acts.
he
was
a
trustee
in
every
sense
of
the
word,
although
called
an
agent.
and
as
i
say
to
your
honors,
in
looking
at
the
substance
rather
than
the
language
used
rather
than
the
form,
you
must
hold
that
mr.
scorese
in
his
appointment
was
a
trustee
in
every
sense.
he
was
fully
in
charge
and
responsible
to
nobody.
he
could
buy.
he
could
sell.
he
could
transfer.
he
could
sign.
he
could
do
everything
that
an
owner
could
do.
but,
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
paramount
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
these
courts,
he
was
deliberately
given
another
name
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
the
consequences
of
his
appointment.
and
so
i
say
my
basic
argument
is
that,
in
looking
at
this
substance
of
his
appointment,
we
came
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
3
(a)
(5).
and
the
latest
manifestation
of
congress’
intent
is
in
the
enactment
of
the
stockholders
protective
investment
act
where
in
section
5,
under
this
new
law
which,
frankly,
was
occasion
as
a
result
of
the
blair
insolvency
and
the
insolvency
of
a
few
of
the
large
stockbrokers
houses.
the
congress
specifically
designated
the
appointment
by
a
court
and
specifically
stated
that
a
court
could
find
the
jurisdiction
under
this
act
if
it
found
this
that
the
particular
debtor
is
the
subject
of
a
proceeding
pending
in
any
court
or
before
the
agency
of
the
united
states
or
any
state
in
which
a
receiver,
trustee,
or
liquidator
for
such
member
has
been
appointed.
so
that,
if
a
liquidator
is
appointed,
if
they
do
this
again,
that
is
if
the
stock
exchange
takes
it
upon
itself
to
control
its
own
liquidation
under
the
stock
holders
protective
investment
act.
congress
has
declared
its
intention
that
liquidations
must
be
under
court
control
and
not
until
private
control.
this
has
been
a
tragic
situation
because
if
this
order
of
confirmation
stands,
approximately
$10
million
was
withdrawn
illegally
out
of
this
corporation
and
this
liquidator,
this
so-called
representative
who
was
supposed
to
take
charge
of
these
assets
did
nothing
to
investigate.
they
gave
away
branches
of
their
company
throughout
the
united
states,
and
no
investigation
was
ever
made.
in
the
record
is
the
story
of
a
giveaway
of
$100,000
to
a
man
by
the
name
of
ligon
(ph)
as
liquidated
damages
for
a
contract
which
was
never
performed,
done
within
a
few
weeks
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
petition
and
filing
to
the
filing
of
the--
prior
to
the
appointment
of
the
liquidator,
and
he
never
did
a
thing
to
get
that
$100,000
back.
there
were
$21
million
of
subordinated
creditors
who
had
been
wiped
out
in
this
chapter
11
proceeding,
completely
wiped
out
all
at
the
liquidation
of
a
private
liquidator
appointed
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
this
is
a
situation
where,
under
section
3
(a)
(5),
we
have
a
right
to
supersede
a
court
appointed
receiver.
we
have
a
right
to
supersede
a
statutory
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
to
supersede
a
common
law
deed
of
trust.
and
yet,
the
court
below
has
held
that
we
cannot
supersede
the
appointment
of
a
private
liquidator.
now,
that
is
not
justice.
that
is
not
the
intent
of
the
law.
this
court,
that
is
the
federal
courts,
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
i
respectfully
ask
your
honors
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
reinstate
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy.
thank
you
for
your
kindly
attention.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
oh!
that’s
quite
alright.
i
said
what
i’ve
got
to
say.
i’ll
only
be
repeating
myself.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
blair
&
co.
was
one
of
the
larger
stockbrokers
in
new
york
and
it
apparently
ran
into
very
severe
financial
trouble
with
the
end
of
its
fiscal
year
of
1969.
and
it
appears
that
between
1969,
that
is
september
of
1969
and
september
of
1970,
they
gradually
liquidated
their
company
by
giving
away,
literally
giving
away
branches
of
their
stock
brokerage
concern
to
other
concerns,
to
which
some
of
their
employees
are
officers,
went
and
became
members
of.
they
paid
out
or
permitted
subordinated
debenture
holders
who
were
members
of
their
boards
of
directors
to
get
their
money
out
of
the
company.
and
late
in
september
of
1970,
they
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
new
york
stock
exchange
special
fund,
by
the
terms
of
which,
the
special
fund
was
permitted
to
appoint
a
person
as
a
liquidator
to
liquidate
blair
&
co.
and,
as
a
matter
of
form,
the
special
fund
loaned
$1,000
to
blair
&
co.
and
proceeded
to
appoint
a
man,
mr.
scorese,
as
a
liquidator
in
a
very
carefully
drawn
and
very
ornate
and
very
carefully
drafted
contract
in
which
his
powers
was
specifically
set
forth
and
in
a
power
of
attorney
which
clearly
set
forth
all
of
his
powers.
and
i
submit
to
you,
without
going
too
deeply
into
the
record,
that
there
isn’t
a
power
that
appears
in
the
contract
or
that
appears
in
the
power
of
attorney
that
differs
in
any
way
from
any
power
that
was
ever
given
to
any
receiver
or
any
trustee
that
was
ever
appointed
by
any
court
or
was
ever
appointed
by
any
insolvent
debtor.
he
was
given
greater
powers
than
a
receiver
because
he
didn’t
have
to
file
a
bond.
he
didn’t
have
to
apply
to
a
court
for
leave
to
sell
anything
or
to
dispose
off
anything.
and
what
is
most
important
as
distinguished
from
other
agents,
he
was
the
sole
judge
of
his
own
powers.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
he
had
no
greater
power.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
he
had
no
greater
power.
he
could
settle,
compromise,
dispose
or
pay
out
any
creditor’s
claim.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
it
could’ve
done
it,
yes,
just
as
it
could’ve.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
none
that
i
was
aware
of.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
don’t
quite
understand
your
question,
sir.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
now,
this
is
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
apparently,
the
position
taken
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
that
it
is
a
power
greater
than
the
court
because,
by
the
constitution
of
the
exchange
as
i
understand
it,
the
powers
were
limited
to
arbitration
within
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
very
petitioners
sought
to
rescind
their
contract.
because,
what
had
occurred
here
was
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
not
at
all.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
not
at
all,
sir.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
an
exchange
member
might
have,
but
my
clients
who
are
subordinated
creditors
were
in
an
extremely
difficult
position
because,
being
subordinated,
they
were
debenture
holders
who
put
their
money
in
on
a
subordinated
basis
at
a
time
when
the
insiders
had
already
taken
their
money
out.
and
in
order
for
my
client
to
go
into
court
and
to
sue
as
a
subordinated
creditor,
they
would’ve
been
faced
with
the
overwhelming
burden
of
having
to
establish,
firstly,
that
there
were
sufficient
assets
in
blair
&
co.
to
pay
all
of
the
un-subordinated
creditors
before
their
right
to
sue
would
arise.
now,
the
problem
in
that
case
that
before
they
could
proceed
with
such
a
suit,
before
they
could
proceed
with
a
proof
to
establish
their
right
to
bring
such
a
suit,
four
months
would
easily
have
elapsed.
within
which,
any
act
of
bankruptcy
such
as
preference,
fraudulent
conveyance
would’ve
expired.
we
were
confronted
with
a
very,
very
difficult
problem.
in
that,
we
found
on
practically
two
days
notice,
am
i
departing
from
your
question?
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
don’t
know.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
don’t
know
and
i
don’t
know
that
it
enters
into
by
problem.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
as
a
result
of
the
constitution
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
compelled
--
resort
to
the
procedures
within
the
exchange.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
this
is
the
great
problem
here.
i
don’t
know
that
it’s
authorized
by
statute.
it’s
authorized
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
where
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
permitted
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
other
acts
by
arrangements
with
the
commission.
i
do
know
that
these
petitioning
creditors
in
this
case,
when
they
sought
to
rescind
their
lending
to
blair
&
co.,
were
compelled
to
go
through
what
seemed
to
us
a
very
unfair
and
one-sided
arbitration
procedure.
the
basic
question
on
this
appeal,
lies
in
the
fact
that
within
four
or
five
days
of
the
appointment
of
the
liquidator
we
petitioned
blair
&
co.
into
bankruptcy.
we
cited
three
acts
of
bankruptcy,
two
of
which
were
eliminated
by
referee
herzog
and
were
not
pursued
in
as
much
as
he
held
in
our
favor
on
the
basic
issue
of
the
appointment
of
the
liquidator.
excuse
me.
our
position
was,
as
with
shakespeare,
that
a
rose
smells
as
sweet
no
matter
what
its
name
that
this
mr.
scorese,
although
named
as
a
liquidator
and
at
other
times
as
an
agent,
actually
came
within
the
intent
of
this
statute,
and
a
reading
of
the
history
of
this
statute
bears
this
out.
this
statute
was
first
enacted
in
the
bankruptcy
act
in
1903,
and
it
was
subsequently
amended
on
several
occasions
into
its
present
form.
and
throughout
the
several
amendments,
the
basic
expression
that
was
involved
here
was
the
doctrine
of
the
appointment
of
somebody
to
take
charge
of
a
liquidation.
this
was
the
essential
concept.
in
the
use
of
the
words
in
the
statute,
it
apparently
was
limited
to
a
receiver
or
a
trustee.
but,
at
the
time
this
petition
was
filed,
every
case,
every
text,
as
i’ve
cited
in
my
brief
before
this
court
which
i
won’t
bother
to
repeat
it,
held
that
a
liquidator
came
within
the
scope
of
this
statute.
it
could’ve
been
a
simple
thing
for
these
petitioning
creditors
to
have
gone
into
the
state
court
of
new
jersey
and
move
for
the
appointment
of
the
state
court
receiver,
and
then
file
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
which
would
have
clearly
come
under
section
3
(a)
(5)
of
the
act.
but
because
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
where
the
four-month
period
was
about
to
run
out
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
filed
it
on
the
last
day,
was
about
to
run
out
on
about
$3.5
million
worth
of
preferences.
based
upon
the
texts
and
upon
the
laws,
we
filed
it.
and
as
it
had
been
promulgated
to
that
date,
we
filed
the
petition
directly.
and
our
position
on
this
appeal
and
the
decision
of
referee
herzog
below
and
the
decision
of
judge
cooper
below
have
clearly
held
that
the
appointment
of
mr.
scorese
came
within
the
scope
of
section
3
(a)
(5)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
despite
the
fact
that,
in
their
wisdom,
the
attorneys
who
represented
blair
&
co.
or
the
new
york
stock
exchange
shows
to
denominate
and
designate
purely
as
a
matter
of
naming
mr.
scorese
not
as
a
trustee
which
he
actually
was,
not
as
a
receiver
which
he
actually
was,
but
as
a
liquidating
agent.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
will,
if
your
honor,
asked
me
this
question,
alright.
i
had
submitted
a
memorandum
on
the
question
of
mootness
and
i
was
prepared
to
argue
the
case
to
the
chief
rather
than
the
question
of
mootness.
the
chapter
11
proceeding
was
filed
as
a
result
of
the
filing
of
this
petition.
there
would’ve
been
no
chapter
11
if
we
had
not
filed
the
petition.
throughout
two
years,
there
was
the
threat
of
confirmation
of
the
chapter
11,
but
it
was
never
confirmed.
just
before
this
case
came
up
for
argument
on
october
2nd
,
the
most
amazing
order
of
confirmation
was
entered.
in
the
25
years
that
i
have
personally
practiced
before
the
bankruptcy
courts,
i
have
never
seen
such
an
order
of
confirmation
because
two-thirds
of
the
claims
which
are
supposed
to
be
taken
care
of
in
the
order
of
confirmation
are
reserved
for
later
litigation.
my
client
has
a
block
of
stock
that
is
worth
a
million
dollars
which
is
unregistered
and
cannot
be
transferred,
and
this
stock
is
being
held
in
limbo
and
is
going
to
be
the
subject
of
further
litigation.
we
have
already
made
a
motion
directed
to
this
order
of
confirmation.
we
did
not
know
the
order
was
entered.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
order
was
entered
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
in
the
practice
of
bankruptcy,
when
the
original
chapter
11
is
filed
the
referee
sends
out
a
notice
of
first
reading
and,
in
the
same
notice,
he
says
a
notice
of
date
of
confirmation
is
also
set.
this
date
was
set
two
years
ago,
and
it
is
constantly
postponed
and
postponed
and
postponed,
and
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
keep
up
with
every
single
adjournment
that
takes
place.
we
never
knew
when
the
hearing
on
confirmation
took
place.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
we
never
get
repeated
notices,
sir.
we
must
appear
on
every
occasion
and,
i
frankly
state,
i
don’t
have
the
staff
to
do
it.
we
must
appear
on
every
occasion,
make
a
note
of
every
adjournment.
and
then
on
the
one
particular
occasion
when
the
debtor,
he
likes
to
hold
his
hearing
on
the
question
of
feasibility
and
the
question
of
whether
the
settlement
is
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors,
they
simply
hold
it
and
then
they
submit
the
order
of
confirmation
to
the
referee
relatively
expired.
there
is
no
new
notice.
under
section
355
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
creditors
are
supposed
to
receive
a
notice
of
the
entry
of
an
order
of
confirmation.
but,
we
never
received
such
a
notice
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
sir?
mr.
leo
h.
raines
no,
sir.
we
did
not
know
that
it
was
entered.
we
have
made
a
motion
to
reconsider
the
order
of
confirmation,
but
it
is
only
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
before
referee
babbitt,
but
it
is
only
in
relation
to
our
particular
problem.
we
could
not
make
it
at
launch.
this
is
a
most
peculiar
chapter
11.
there
was
never
a
committee
of
creditors
appointed.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
would
still
contend
that
it’s
not
moot,
sir,
and
interestingly
enough,
in
one
of
the
cases
in
which
rely
heavily
in
my
approach
to
this
court,
bank
of
marin
against
england.
the
same
question
was
also
raised
as
to
whether
the
decision
was
moot.
now,
this
court
held
that
there
was
going
to
be
further
litigation
even
outside
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
and
there
will
be
further
litigation
in
this
case.
the
determination
of
what
happens
to
our
roger
stock
is
specifically
keyed
to
whether
or
not
there
is
going
to
be
an
adjudication
here.
by
an
exhibit,
which
i
attach
to
my
memorandum
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
i’m
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
direct
an
adjudication.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
yes,
the
chapter
11
order
of
confirmation
can
still
be
set
aside.
there
is
a
six-month
period
within
which
a
motion
can
be
made
to
set
aside
an
order
of
confirmation.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
sir?
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
the
adjudication
is
separate
from
the
order
of
confirmation.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
they
superseded
in
a
sense
that
they
set
it
aside.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
that’s
right.
they
do
not
dismiss
it.
the
problem
--
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
when
we
moved
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding,
early
in
the
proceeding,
referee
babbitt
held
up
the
decision
for
about
nine
or
ten
months.
and,
when
the
court
of
appeals
came
down
with
a
decision
reversing
the
court
below
and
vacating
the
order
of
adjudication,
in
part
of
his
decision
which
i
put
in
my
memorandum,
he
said
“i
can’t
dismiss
the
proceeding
now
because
if
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
order
of
adjudication,
this
court
would
lose
jurisdiction
of
this
case
and
it
would
be
sort
of
flowing
the
case
to
the
wolves.”
and,
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
referee
babbitt
gave
for
refusing
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
yes,
they
are
allowed
fees.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
that’s
a
question
before
referee
babbitt
from
which
there
might
be
some
disagreement.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
yes,
sir.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
he
is
still
entitled
to
fees.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
yes.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
the
adjudication
is
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
may
not
be.
i’m
not
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
this
is
one
of
the
elements
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
i
think
it
would
--
i
did
not
so
state
in
my
memorandum
because
i
felt
that
my
personal
affairs
is
of
no
concern
to
this
court.
but
in
as
much
as
your
honors
been
good
enough
to
raise
it,
it
certainly
is
one
of
the
elements
that
i’m
deeply
concerned.
and
also,
as
a
question
of
cost,
my
client
has
lost
$3
million
and
he
is
now
faced
with
a
bill
of
course
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
excess
of
$4,000.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
it’s
a
consideration.
it’s
an
element
of
consideration.
but,
basically,
the
reason
i
say
it
is
not
moot
is
because,
as
i
argued
in
my
memorandum
of
law
judge,
this
decision
on
judge
friendly’s
of
the
court
of
appeals
is,
in
my
opinion,
one
of
the
most
dangerous.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
it
could
be
moot
on
a
matter
of
theory,
but
it
isn’t
moot
because
there
is
much
litigation
that
is
still
to
follow
in
this
case.
and
the
question
of
adjudication
becomes
a
paramount
importance
in
this
subsequent
litigation.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
i
would
be
entitled
to
fees
as
attorney
for
petitioning
creditors
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
--
does
not
lapse.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
it
merely
is
set
aside.
it
is
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
that
is
my
opinion,
sir,
yes.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
there
are
cases
so
holding.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well,
i
can’t
answer
that
because
that
is
a
question
that
i
have
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
no,
i
know
of
no
case
that
holds
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
that
if
it
is
subsequently
not
adjudicated
--
mr.
leo
h.
raines
well
if
the
law
is,
then
i
get
it,
whether
it’s
adjudicated
or
not,
then
i’m
home
free.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
if
i
win.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
as
far
as
leo
raines
is
concerned,
it
is
a
very
important
and
non-moot.[laughter]
it
is
very
important.
i
have
rested,
if
i
may
go
back
to
my
case
in
chief,
i
have
rested
my
position
on
this
appeal,
as
i
did
below,
on
the
fact
that
this
court
has
ruled
to
get
it
again
on
basic
paramount
issues
that
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
federal
courts
have
paramount
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
liquidation
of
insolvent
estate.
based
upon
the
cases
of
the
bank
of
marin
against
england,
and
pepper
against
litton,
the
doctrine
that
substance
will
not
give
way
to
form
and
that
technical
considerations
will
not
prevent
substantial
justice
from
being
done.
now,
these
principles
were
followed
by
other
courts.
in
1941,
in
the
district
court
of
oklahoma,
a
petition
was
filed
which
was
technically
incorrect
and
the
court
itself,
in
rendering
its
opinion,
stated
that
it
had
very
serious
doubts
whether
technically
it
came
within
the
specific
scope
of
the
statute.
but
the
court
said
the
court
will
not
stand
on
a
technicality
with
reference
to
form
when
substance
is
alleged.
and
it
held,
that
despite
its
doubt
that
the
appointment
of
a
liquidator
by
contract
constituted
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
nonetheless
found
it
sufficient
to
constitute
an
act
of
bankruptcy.
now
this
case,
in
the
manner
of
r.v.
smith,
was
cited
in
talius
(ph),
cited
in
remington,
the
two
leading
text
on
the
subject,
as
the
guide
to
which
we
attorneys
follow.
and,
as
i’ve
cited
in
my
brief,
talius
specifically
said
in
so
many
words,
on
page
4
--
that
a
liquidating
trust
--
that
a
liquidator
appointed
by
contract
came
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
in
1953,
judge
winfield,
who
i’m
certain
your
honors
will
recognize
as
one
of
the
outstanding
jurists
on
the
question
of
bankruptcy,
wrote
a
landmark
decision
in
which
he
argued
--
in
which
he
stated,
if
i
may,
i’ve
cited
it
in
my
briefs,
again
following
the
principle
of
pepper
against
litton,
“it
is
not
required
that
the
transferee
of
the
property
be
formally
appointed
as
trustee
by
a
ceremonial
document
referring
to
him
as
such.
the
method
adopted
to
affect
the
transfer
is
immaterial.
it
is
the
end
result
that
counts.
any
action
by
one
who
is
insolvent
which
effectively
causes
the
transfer
of
his
property
to
another
for
final
liquidation
purposes
appoints
the
transferee
a
trustee
to
take
charge
of
his
property
under
section
3
subdivision
(a)
(5).
now,
this
is
the
point
we
make
here.
mr.
scorese,
whether
you
named
him
an
agent
or
a
liquidator,
a
trustee,
or
a
receiver
was
the
identical
person
given
the
identical
powers.
he
was
given
completely
in
charge
unlike
an
agent,
as
i’ve
cited
in
bogart
and
trusts,
unlike
an
agent,
he
had
no
responsibility
to
his
principle.
as
you
read
the
contract,
you
realize
that
he
was
the
sole
judge
of
his
own
acts.
he
was
a
trustee
in
every
sense
of
the
word,
although
called
an
agent.
and
as
i
say
to
your
honors,
in
looking
at
the
substance
rather
than
the
language
used
rather
than
the
form,
you
must
hold
that
mr.
scorese
in
his
appointment
was
a
trustee
in
every
sense.
he
was
fully
in
charge
and
responsible
to
nobody.
he
could
buy.
he
could
sell.
he
could
transfer.
he
could
sign.
he
could
do
everything
that
an
owner
could
do.
but,
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
paramount
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
these
courts,
he
was
deliberately
given
another
name
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
the
consequences
of
his
appointment.
and
so
i
say
my
basic
argument
is
that,
in
looking
at
this
substance
of
his
appointment,
we
came
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
3
(a)
(5).
and
the
latest
manifestation
of
congress’
intent
is
in
the
enactment
of
the
stockholders
protective
investment
act
where
in
section
5,
under
this
new
law
which,
frankly,
was
occasion
as
a
result
of
the
blair
insolvency
and
the
insolvency
of
a
few
of
the
large
stockbrokers
houses.
the
congress
specifically
designated
the
appointment
by
a
court
and
specifically
stated
that
a
court
could
find
the
jurisdiction
under
this
act
if
it
found
this
that
the
particular
debtor
is
the
subject
of
a
proceeding
pending
in
any
court
or
before
the
agency
of
the
united
states
or
any
state
in
which
a
receiver,
trustee,
or
liquidator
for
such
member
has
been
appointed.
so
that,
if
a
liquidator
is
appointed,
if
they
do
this
again,
that
is
if
the
stock
exchange
takes
it
upon
itself
to
control
its
own
liquidation
under
the
stock
holders
protective
investment
act.
congress
has
declared
its
intention
that
liquidations
must
be
under
court
control
and
not
until
private
control.
this
has
been
a
tragic
situation
because
if
this
order
of
confirmation
stands,
approximately
$10
million
was
withdrawn
illegally
out
of
this
corporation
and
this
liquidator,
this
so-called
representative
who
was
supposed
to
take
charge
of
these
assets
did
nothing
to
investigate.
they
gave
away
branches
of
their
company
throughout
the
united
states,
and
no
investigation
was
ever
made.
in
the
record
is
the
story
of
a
giveaway
of
$100,000
to
a
man
by
the
name
of
ligon
(ph)
as
liquidated
damages
for
a
contract
which
was
never
performed,
done
within
a
few
weeks
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
petition
and
filing
to
the
filing
of
the--
prior
to
the
appointment
of
the
liquidator,
and
he
never
did
a
thing
to
get
that
$100,000
back.
there
were
$21
million
of
subordinated
creditors
who
had
been
wiped
out
in
this
chapter
11
proceeding,
completely
wiped
out
all
at
the
liquidation
of
a
private
liquidator
appointed
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
this
is
a
situation
where,
under
section
3
(a)
(5),
we
have
a
right
to
supersede
a
court
appointed
receiver.
we
have
a
right
to
supersede
a
statutory
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
to
supersede
a
common
law
deed
of
trust.
and
yet,
the
court
below
has
held
that
we
cannot
supersede
the
appointment
of
a
private
liquidator.
now,
that
is
not
justice.
that
is
not
the
intent
of
the
law.
this
court,
that
is
the
federal
courts,
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
i
respectfully
ask
your
honors
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
reinstate
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy.
thank
you
for
your
kindly
attention.
mr.
leo
h.
raines
oh!
that’s
quite
alright.
i
said
what
i’ve
got
to
say.
i’ll
only
be
repeating
myself.
