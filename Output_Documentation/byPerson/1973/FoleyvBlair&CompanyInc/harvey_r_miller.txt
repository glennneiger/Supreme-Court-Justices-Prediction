mr.
harvey
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
harvey
r.
miller.
i
represent
the
respondents
in
this
cause.
it
is
our
position,
your
honors,
that
the
cause
presented
today
is
moot
by
reason
of
the
determination
of
the
chapter
11
proceedings.
approximately
two
weeks
ago,
we
filed
a
memorandum
in
which
we
suggested
that
the
cause
is
moot.
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
that
memorandum,
mr.
raines
filed
a
reply
or
an
answering
memorandum.
and
basically,
mr.
raines
had
raised
12
points.
he
agrees
100%
with
each
of
the
authorities
which
we
have
cited
to
show
that
the
cause
is
moot.
however,
he
says
that
the
court
should
consider
the
merits
of
this
matter
for
the
following
reasons.
one,
he
did
not
receive
notice
of
entry
of
the
order
of
confirmation.
notice
of
a
hearing
to
consider
confirmation
of
the
arrangement
was
given
by
the
bankruptcy
court
to
all
parties
in
interest,
including
mr.
raines
and
his
clients.
under
rule
77
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
as
well
as
rule
922
(a)
of
the
rules
of
bankruptcy
practice
which
became
effective
on
october
1,
1973.
there
is
no
requirement
that
notice
of
entry
be
given
and
it
specifically
states
that
lack
of
notice
of
the
entry
does
not
affect
the
time
to
appeal
or
relieve
of
authorize
the
court
to
relieve
a
body
for
failure
to
appeal
within
the
time
allowed.
the
order
of
confirmation
is
final
for
all
purposes.
distribution
has
been
made
to
creditors.
administration
expenses
have
been
paid.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
there
is.
we
were
served,
your
honor,
with
a
motion
which
i
believe
is
returnable
december
5
to
reconsider
his
clients’
claims,
and
i
will
get
to
that,
if
you
will,
your
honor.
mr.
raines
says
in
his
second
point
that
the
order
of
confirmation
was
entered
prematurely.
mr.
raines,
on
behalf
of
his
client,
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding
and
the
basis
of
the
dismissal
of
the
chapter
11
proceeding
was
that
you
could
not
have
an
arrangement
in
this
type
of
a
case.
and,
as
i
have
found
in
practicing
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
when
you
don’t
have
much
law
it
becomes
almost
academic
to
cite
pepper
v.
litton
because
the
bankruptcy
practitioners
take
the
position
that
under
pepper
v.
litton
you
could
do
anything.
well
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
by
an
order
and
an
opinion
of
referee
babbitt
dated
february
16,
1973.
and
in
the
final
paragraph
of
that
opinion,
referee
babbitt
said
“foley’s
motion
must
be
denied
in
all
respects
and
upon
this
order
becoming
final,
it
is
expected
that
blair
will
move
promptly
to
a
confirmation
of
its
arrangement.
its
creditors
have
waited
long
enough.”
subsequent
to
february
16
and
with
the
constant
prodding
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
over
9,500
claims
were
objected
to
and
resolved.
over
9,000
claims
were
expunged.
distributions
were
made
to
all
of
the
customer
creditors
during
that
period
of
time.
the
arrangement
was
confirmed
30
months
after
it
was
filed.
i
respectfully
submit
that
nobody
could
say
that
it
was
a
premature
confirmation.
further,
your
honor,
in
the
brief
in
our
position
that
we
filed
in
this
proceeding,
at
least
three
times
we
said
that
confirmation
of
the
arrangement
was
imminent
and
that
we
were
moving
towards
confirmation.
the
third
point
which
mr.
raines
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
the
proceeding
is
terminated,
your
honor.
under
the
authorities
which
we
have
cited
in
the
memorandum
suggesting
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
mr.
raines
has
reserved
his
right
to
file
an
application
for
allowance.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
mr.
raines
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
happened
to
be
in
the
courthouse
that
day
when
mr.
raines’
partner
appeared
and
i
was
called
in
by
judge
babbitt
who
asked
me
if
we
had
any
objection
if
mr.
raines
filed
his
application
subsequently.
and
i
believe
there
was
a
letter
from
the
referee
in
which
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
no,
i’m
not
certain,
your
honor,
that
i
would
agree
with
that
principle.
he’s
entitled
to
a
fee.
maybe
the
quantum
of
the
fee
would
be
different
if
he
sustained
efficiently.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
it
may
well
be,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
he
may
be
entitled
to
a
larger
fee.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
third
point
which
mr.
raines
has
raised
is
that
the
arrangement
was
voted
and
approved
by
the
slim
vote
of
general
and
secured
creditors.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
subsequent
memorandum
the
actual
findings
that
the
bankruptcy
court
made
in
respect
of
the
acceptance
of
the
plan.
and
of
the
7,633
customer
creditors
whose
claims
aggregated
$37,380,000;
6,350
customer
creditors
whose
claims
aggregated
to
$33,100,000
accept
that
the
arrangement
of
the
general
creditors,
and
93
creditors
whose
claims
totaled
$3,261,000;
66
accepted
the
arrangement
and
their
claims
aggregated
$2,800,000,
hardly
a
slim
majority.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
in
my
terms,
your
honor?
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
under
section
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
your
honor,
which
is
entitled
priorities,
the
court
is
authorized
to
allow
one
reasonable
attorney’s
fee
in
respect
of
the
attorney
for
petitioning
creditors.
my
understanding
of
the
precedence
in
connection
with
the
matter
is
if
you
sustain
the
petition,
then
you
are
entitled
to
a
greater
fee
depending
upon
the
type
of
opposition
you
met,
the
complexity
of
the
problems,
the
amount
of
time
which
was
devoted
to
it,
the
quality
of
your
opposition.
so,
there’s
a
possibility
that
he
could
be
entitled
to
a
greater
fee
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
plea.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
blair
would
pay
it,
your
honor.
it’s
an
administration
expense
and
it
would
have
to
be
paid
from
the
estate.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
doesn’t
seem
to
indicate
that.
i
wouldn’t
certainly
argue
that
in
connection
with
mr.
raines.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
well,
i
have
seen,
your
honor,
where
the
bankruptcy
court
has
given
a
token
fee
of
$100
or
$250.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
if
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
your
honor,
is
superseded
by
a
chapter
11
proceeding,
whether
there
has
been
an
adjudication
or
not.
for
example,
if
immediately
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
involuntary
petition,
without
going
to
trial
on
the
issue
of
adjudication,
blair
had
filed
a
chapter
11
proceeding
and
the
question
of
adjudication
was
never
resolved
because
you
have
a
constructive
adjudication
in
the
chapter
11
proceeding
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
would
think
not,
your
honor,
although
i
have
heard
from
mr.
raines’
respondent
for
the
contrary.
mr.
raines’
fourth
point,
your
honor,
is
in
respect
to
the
mootness
point,
is
that
i
made
a
statement
before
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
if
the
district
court
decision
was
reversed,
blair
would
move
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11.
i
never
made
any
such
statement.
his
fifth
point
is
that
80%
of
the
claims
included
in
the
schedules
of
distribution
are
subject
to
objections
as
to
allowance.
mr.
raines
pays
no
attention
to
the
fact
that
approximately
9,500
claims
were
objected
to.
trials
were
heard
before
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
those
claims
were
resolved.
moreover,
there
aren’t
objections
pending
as
80%
of
the
claims.
all
blair
did
was
reserve
its
right
to
file
objections
if
necessary.
if
blair
does
not
file
objections
within
90
days,
then
those
claims
are
allowed
automatically.
his
next
point
is
that
foley’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
petition
was
denied
by
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
who
was
strongly
influenced
by
the
decision
of
united
states
court
of
appeals.
mr.
raines
does
not
advise
the
court
in
his
memorandum
that
an
appeal
was
filed
from
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding,
was
heard
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
seventh
district
of
new
york
and
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
was
affirmed.
and
former
chief
judge
sylvester
ryan
held
that
the
grounds
argued
by
foley
for
dismissal
to
be
frivolous
and
without
merit
or
substance.
mr.
foley
never
took
an
appeal
from
that
decision
and
that
is
a
final
decision.
his
next
point
is
that
the
new
york
stock
exchange
was
being
unjustly
enriched
and
creditors
might
possibly
get
a
greater
return
in
liquidation
under
the
supervision
of
a
court
appointed
trustee.
well,
even
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
the
chapter
11
proceeding
is
finished.
besides
which,
and
specifically
provided
by
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
you
may
have
a
provision
and
an
arrangement
whereby,
on
the
confirmation
or
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding,
the
remaining
assets
of
a
debtor
are
transferred
to
a
third
party,
usually
it’s
the
party
who
put
up
the
money.
now,
in
the
case
of
bache,
the
new
york
stock
exchange
advanced
$20.4
million
to
satisfy
customer
creditor
claims
in
this
case.
the
assets
remaining
to
blair
in
no
way
measure
up
to
$20.4
million.
in
addition,
in
order
to
confirm
a
chapter
11
proceeding,
under
section
366
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
bankruptcy
court
must
make
a
determination
that
the
arrangement
is
for
the
best
interest
of
creditors.
the
phrase
“best
interest
of
creditors”
has
been
construed
to
mean
“and
require
a
determination
by
the
bankruptcy
court
that
the
creditors
will
receive
more
in
satisfaction
of
their
claims
pursuant
to
the
chapter
11
arrangement,
and
they
would
receive
in
a
liquidation
of
the
estate
in
ordinary
bankruptcy.”
and
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
and
he
made
a
finding
that
this
arrangement
was
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors
that
they
would
receive
more
under
the
arrangement
than
they
would
receive
in
the
event
of
a
liquidation
under
ordinary
bankruptcy
chapters
1
through
7.
mr.
raines’
next
point
is
that
an
adjudication
in
bankruptcy
can
be
used
as
a
fulcrum
upon
which
a
more
complete
investigation
and
interrogation
to
the
very
justice
of
the
plan
and
a
reconsideration
of
the
best
interest
of
creditors
should
be
predicated.
this
arrangement
was
proposed
by
blair
on
may
25,
1971.
mr.
foley
and
all
of
the
other
creditors
had
at
least
two-and-a-half
years
to
conduct
whatever
investigation
they
desired
for
the
terms
of
the
arrangement,
the
assets,
liabilities
or
affairs
of
blair.
in
point
of
fact,
mr.
foley,
through
his
attorneys,
conducted
extensive
examinations
of
officers,
employees
of
blair,
as
well
as
liquidator.
we
submit
that
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
are
terminated
by
the
final
order
of
confirmation.
mr.
raines
goes
on
in
his
next
point.
he
says
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
a
re-pleased
throughout
his
brief.
he
says
that
the
decision
is
a
royal
road
to
our
beacon-like
to
fraud
and
deceit
and
chicanery.
he
never
once
mentions
that
there
are
other
acts
of
bankruptcy
which
could
be
alleged.
if
blair
was
engaged
in
fraud,
if
blair
did
make
a
fraudulent
claim,
section
3
has
six
acts
of
bankruptcy.
if
he
missed
on
this
one,
he
could’ve
filed
a
petition
in
which
he
alleged
that
it
was
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
in
which
he
alleged
there
was
a
preference,
in
which
he
alleged
that
blair
admitted
in
writing
its
inability
to
pay
its
debts
as
they
matured
and
its
willingness
to
be
adjudged
the
bankrupt.
mr.
raines
has
referred
to
four-month
period.
many
of
the
acts
of
bankruptcy
in
section
3
are
not
limited
by
a
four-month
period.
a
fraudulent
conveyance
can
be
six
years
under
state
law,
new
york
state
that
is.
his
next
statement
in
which
he
persists
in
making
is
that
blair
is
guilty
of
a
giveaway
of
$100,000
which
has
never
been
pursued
or
recovered
by
the
liquidator.
that
so-called
giveaway
was
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
a
management
contract
for
the
blair
fund,
that
is,
the
position
of
mr.
foley
that
blair
should
have
received
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
that
management
contract.
subsequent
decisions
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
rosenfeld
versus
black,
have
established
now
that
you
cannot
make
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
that
contract.
in
any
event,
that
transaction
was
never
consummated.
blair
did
deposit
with
the
respective
purchaser
a
$100,000
to
serve
his
liquidated
damages
in
the
event
that
it
did
not
perform
in
accordance
with
the
contract.
mr.
foley
and
mr.
raines
keep
insisting
that
nothing
was
done
to
recover
that
$100,000.
we
have
told
mr.
raines,
we
have
told
mr.
foley
that
an
action
was
commenced
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
every
effort
was
being
made
to
recover
that
$100,000,
and
it
just
goes
over
the
waterways.
the
action
was
commenced
in
1971.
in
point
of
fact,
that
it
was
tried
three
or
four
months
ago
and
by
decision
dated
october
31,
1973
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
unfortunately,
for
the
defendant.
his
next
point
is
that
blair
seeks
--
foley,
i’m
sorry,
seeks
the
recovery
of
securities
he
deposited
with
blair
and
which
are
subordinated
to
the
claims
of
other
creditors.
this
is
not
the
first
effort
that
mr.
foley
has
made
to
recover
his
securities.
before
the
bankruptcy
proceedings,
mr.
foley
commenced
an
action
against
blair.
the
action
was
commenced
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
new
york
county.
blair
moved
to
stay
that
action
pending
arbitration.
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
supreme
court
directed
that
the
parties
proceed
to
arbitration.
mr.
foley
litigated
his
right
to
receive
back
those
securities.
he
lost
the
arbitration.
the
securities
were
deemed
to
be
the
securities
of
blair
for
the
satisfaction
of
claims
of
creditors.
the
only
reason
why
these
particular
securities
were
not
sold
is
that
they
are
unregistered
and
they’re
restricted
or
some
of
the
securities
are
subject
to
the
1%
rule.
otherwise,
they
would’ve
been
sold.
he
has
no
right
to
those
securities.
the
arbitration
award
was
confirmed
by
an
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
states
of
new
york.
mr.
foley
never
took
an
appeal
from
that
decision.
in
point
of
fact,
i
might
also
add,
that
mr.
foley
has
pending
at
the
present
time
two
plenary
actions.
he
is
suing
all
of
the
officers
and
directors
of
blair
alleging
10
(b)
(5)
violations
in
common
law
fraud,
etcetera.
he
is
also
suing
the
new
york
stock
exchange
in
a
plenary
action
in
which
he
is
asserting
that
the
new
york
stock
exchange
failed
to
exercise
and
perform
its
duties
of
self-regulation.
so,
that
point
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
this
court
may
do
with
this
particular
matter.
his
next
to
the
last
point
is
that
he
is
liable,
mr.
foley,
for
a
cause
awarded
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
there
is
an
unbroken
line
of
cases
which
establishes
the
rule
that
controversy
as
to
cause
alone
does
not
salvage
an
otherwise
moot
the
case.
and
the
lead
case
is
walling
versus
reuter
&
co.,
321
u.s.
671,
and
other
cases
are
cited
in
the
footnote
of
mr.
justice
fortas
in
the
bank
of
marin
case.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don’t
see
that
mr.
raines
is
in
any
event
or
position
to
change
this
controversy
from
one
which
is
moot
simply
because
he
has
an
interest
in
getting
a
fee
out
of
this
case.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
he
wants
a
fee
out
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
that’s
a
cost
of
the
administration
of
the
proceeding,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
and
i
don’t
think
it
changes
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
it’s
a
cause
and
--
i
suppose
we’d
state
an
ordinary
bankruptcy,
your
honor.
it’s
a
cost
of
--
i
would
put
that
in
the
same
category
as
the
course
which
was
set
by
the
court
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i’m
not
quite
sure
of
that
volume,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
right.
if
i
understand
what
your
honor
is
saying
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
understand
what
your
honor
is
saying,
your
honor
is
saying
that
even
though
the
matter
may
be
moot,
the
fact
that
an
attorney
has
a
fee
involved
in
it
may
change
that
from
being
a
moot
matter.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
well,
i
don’t
know
what
arrangements
mr.
raines
may
have
made
with
his
client.
he
may
have
a
contingent
fee
basis.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
no,
the
act
reads
in
those
terms,
your
honor,
but
the
application
is
made
by
the
attorney
and
the
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
well
as
the
act
reads,
your
honor
--
the
act,
as
i
recall
it
says
that
the
petitioning
creditor
shall
be
reimbursed
for
the
fees
which
they
may
have
paid
to
their
attorneys.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
which
i
would
argue,
your
honor,
it’s
a
cost
of
the
proceeding
and,
in
fact,
i
would
say
this
petition
was
filed
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
of
this
particular
proceeding,
no,
your
honor.
the
last
statement
or
the
last
point
that
mr.
raines
makes
is
that
the
situation
is
a
scandal.
i
don’t
think
i
have
any
words
which
can
respond
to
that
argument.
i
might
point
out,
your
honor,
that
when
this
petition
in
bankruptcy,
this
involuntary
petition
in
bankruptcy
was
filed
there
were
28,000
customers
of
blair
who
had
their
securities
and
their
credit
balances
at
blair.
if
this
proceeding
had
gone
through
involuntary
bankruptcy
proceedings
under
chapters
1
through
7
and
mr.
foley
made
an
application
for
the
appointment
of
a
receiver
which
was
denied
by
the
district
court,
the
fees
which
would’ve
been
paid
out
of
this
estate
and
there
would’ve
been
receivers,
attorneys,
accountants,
disbursing
agents,
etcetera
would’ve
exceeded
$7
million
based
upon
the
properties
which
were
in
the
possession
of
blair
at
the
time
that
the
petition
was
filed.
we
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors,
that
this
case
is
moot
irrespective
of
what
the
court
may
do.
and
i
certainly
would
not
favor
the
court
reversing
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
which
events,
your
honor?
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
although
we
did
argue
in
our
position
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
could
mention
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
think
a
remand
might
be
appropriate,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
at
the
time
that
the
second
circuit
decided
it,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
was
still
pending,
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding.
assuming
that
mr.
raines
and
mr.
foley
had
been
successful
in
dismissing
the
chapter
11
proceeding,
we
would’ve
had
to
rely
upon
the
dismissal
of
the
ordinary
bankruptcy
petition.
we
were
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
the
fees
that
would’ve
been
paid
out
of
this
estate
would’ve
made
it
impossible
to
satisfy
customer
claimants
in
full.
it
would’ve
required
$35
million
in
order
to
have
accomplished
that
fact.
we
believe
that
the
decision,
the
order
of
confirmation
which
was
not
appealed
from
and
which,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
mr.
raines
knew
it
was
coming
on
to
be
heard.
he’s
been
following
this
proceeding.
his
partner
checks
the
docket
all
the
time.
it
was
a
resignation
on
his
part.
and
moreover,
he
never
took
an
appeal
from
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
petition
in
which
he
raised
exactly
the
same
points
he
is
raising
in
his
motion
upcoming
on
in
december,
your
honor.
and
i
might
add,
if
i
--
if
your
honor
will,
i
will
go
into
the
case
in
point
the
merits
of
this
matter.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
appointment
of
an
agent
to
liquidate
property
who,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
points
out,
has
no
right
--
has
no
powers
over
creditors.
he
cannot
affect
creditors.
mr.
justice
white
asked
“could
we
stay
broker
dealers
who
did
business
with
blair?”
we
could
not
stay
them.
the
only
grounds
that
blair
might
have
had
to
stay
a
plenary
action
was
that
there
was
an
arbitration
contract
and
compelled
to
whoever
was
suing
blair
to
go
into
arbitration
under
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
but
that’s
only
as
to
member
firms.
if
an
over-the-counter
broker
had
sued
blair,
there
would
be
a
plenary
action.
we
had
absolutely
no
power
to
deal
with
creditors.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
of
the
exchange?
no,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
only
because
there
was
the
arbitration
contract
between
blair
and
there
were
many
--
in
fact,
at
the
time
of
the
appointment
of
the
liquidator,
there
were
many
plenary
actions
pending.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
sir?m
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
exactly,
your
honor.
and,
in
effect
what
would
happen
upon
the
appointment
of
receiver
would
be
that
the
property
would
past
into
custodial
legist
and
creditors
would
be
constrained
to
file
claims
with
the
receiver
and
they
would
share
pro
rata.
this
is
exactly
the
point
in
bonnie
classics
which
is
relied
on
very
heavily
by
referee
herzog
and
judge
cooper.
in
the
case
of
bonnie
classics,
when
the
corporation
decided
to
liquidate
under
the
new
york
stock
corporation
law,
the
board
of
directors
became
vested
with
title
as
trustees
and
creditors
were
restrained
from
proceeding
against
the
property
of
the
corporation.
they
had
to
wait
until
the
assets
were
liquidated,
the
trust
rates
were
distributed.
every
case
in
which
it
has
been
held
that
there
is
a
receiver
or
a
trustee
appointed
under
3
(a)
(5),
there
has
been
an
inhibition
against
the
creditors
proceeding.
this
was
not
the
case
in
connection
with
blair.
in
fact,
there
is
a
district
court
case
in
ray
ambrose
matthews
and
co.
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
in
which
there
was
a
similar
type
agreement.
and
the
court
held,
and
this
is
a
district
court
decision
in
new
jersey,
as
the
instrument
brought
about
no
change
in
title
to
the
property,
either
absolute
or
condition,
nothing
was
conveyed
nor
transferred
by
it
and
it
could
not
hinder,
delay,
or
defraud
creditors
because
any
creditor
could
proceed
to
satisfy
his
claim
from
the
corporation’s
property
to
the
same
extent
as
though
the
instrument
did
not
exist.
that
is
exactly
the
situation
which
occurred
in
connection
with
blair.
essentially,
mr.
scorese
was
an
agent
of
the
board
of
directors
of
blair.
he
had
no
greater
powers
than
the
board
of
directors
had
and
he
dealt
with
the
property.
in
fact,
he
could
be
removed
by
blair.
all
blair
had
to
do
at
that
point
in
time
was
pay
back
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
$1,000
and
mr.
scorese’s
appointment
was
vacated.
and
i
might
add
on
the
$1,000,
your
honor,
it’s
simply
a
question
in
order
to
trigger
the
appointment
of
a
liquidator,
the
exchange
had
to
advance
some
money.
eventually,
$20.4
million
came
into
this
case.
now,
in
connection
with
the
merits
of
the
matter,
under
section
3
(a)
(5),
the
statute
is
very
specific
in
talking
about
a
receiver
or
a
trustee.
it’s
our
position
that
the
receiver
or
trustee
must
be
judicially
appointed
or
appointed
pursuant
to
a
statute.
and
mr.
raines
has
alluded
to
the
development
of
section
3
(a)
(5).
we
have
set
forth
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
how
the
statute
was
developed.
the
point
which
is
relied
upon
very
heavily
by
the
petitioners
here
is
that
in
the
1926
amendment
to
section
3
(a)
(5),
the
words
“appointed
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
any
state
or
territory”
were
deleted.
as
chief
judge
friendly
has
noted
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
elimination
of
those
words
were
described
in
the
house
report
as
only
a
phraseology
and
there
was
no
intent
to
change
the
substance
of
the
statute.
and
chief
judge
friendly
has
gone
into
great
detail
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history.
furthermore,
when
congress
intended
to
use
the
language
“an
agent
authorized
to
liquidate
property,”
and
congress
has
used
that
language
in
section
2
(a)
(21)
which
was
amended
as
part
of
the
or
brought
into
the
bankruptcy
act
as
part
of
a
chandler
act
of
1938,
it
specifically
refers
to
an
agent
to
authorized
to
liquidate
property.
in
1952,
the
statute
was
amended
again
section
69
(d)
and
that
language
was
put
into
the
statute.
in
69
(d),
the
statute
puts
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
an
agent
authorized
to
liquidate
for
the
purposes
of
accounting.
we
submit
on
the
basis
of
the
amendments
in
the
legislative
history
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
include
as
an
act
of
bankruptcy
the
appointment
of
an
agent
authorized
to
liquidate,
it
would’ve
said
so,
as
chief
judge
friendly
has
pointed
out.
we
believe
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
legislature
to
deal
with,
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
presently
pending
before
the
house
and
before
the
senate
a
new
bankruptcy
act
h.r.
10792
which
is
legislatively
going
to
change
the
acts
of
bankruptcy
and
will
include
in
those
acts
of
bankruptcy
an
agent
authorized
to
liquidate
property.
on
the
basis
of
that,
we
submit
that
this
is
something
that
should
be
left
to
the
legislature.
this
court
should
not
enlarge
section
3
(a)
(5)
so
that
a
petition
can
be
filed
simply
because
an
agent
is
appointed
to
liquidate.
filing
a
bankruptcy
petition
is
not
a
matter
which
should
be
taken
lightly.
there
are
many,
many
factors
that
are
involved.
there
are
many,
many
people
that
are
affected
by
the
filing
of
the
petition.
in
this
case,
customs
were
adversely
affected.
securities
and
exchange
commission
issued
a
release
in
which
they
pointed
out
that
the
administration
of
these
proceedings
had
caused
an
additional
$5
million
by
reason
of
a
bankruptcy
petition.
they
criticized
the
filing
of
the
petition
and
the
allowance
of
the
commission.
this
is
a
situation
which,
frankly,
i
was
little
surprised
to
be
here
this
morning.
i
was
sure
that
this
is
a
case
that
requires
no
further
action
by
any
court.
the
case
is
finished.
the
customers
have
been
satisfied.
the
creditors
have
received
the
distribution
to
the
extent
their
claims
have
been
allowed.
and
very
substantial
administration
expenses
have
already
been
paid
out.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
have
no
objection
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
your
honor,
i
would
say,
in
case
of
a
particular
situation
that
has
come
before
the
court
today,
this
will
never
happen
again.
mr.
raines
has
quoted
a
specific
act.
he
has
misquoted
it.
where
a
member
firm
or
any
broker
dealer
who’s
registered
under
the
34
act
incurs
financial
difficulties
of
one
type
or
another
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
it’s
an
obligation
of
the
exchange
to
advise
to
the
sec
and
then
an
application
is
made
by
subject
for
the
appointment
of
a
trustee.
this
situation
could
never
arise
again
in
connection
with
member
firms.
so
that
it’s
really
a
sui
generis
case
and
it
does
not
establish
a
precedent
which
is
going
to
do
harm
to
the
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
hopefully,
we’re
going
to
have
a
new
bankruptcy
act
that’s
called
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1973
in
the
house
bill.
hopefully,
it
will
be
passed
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
well,
i’m
afraid,
your
honor,
that
the
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
the
treasury
department
may
have
some
objections
to
it.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
harvey
r.
miller.
i
represent
the
respondents
in
this
cause.
it
is
our
position,
your
honors,
that
the
cause
presented
today
is
moot
by
reason
of
the
determination
of
the
chapter
11
proceedings.
approximately
two
weeks
ago,
we
filed
a
memorandum
in
which
we
suggested
that
the
cause
is
moot.
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
that
memorandum,
mr.
raines
filed
a
reply
or
an
answering
memorandum.
and
basically,
mr.
raines
had
raised
12
points.
he
agrees
100%
with
each
of
the
authorities
which
we
have
cited
to
show
that
the
cause
is
moot.
however,
he
says
that
the
court
should
consider
the
merits
of
this
matter
for
the
following
reasons.
one,
he
did
not
receive
notice
of
entry
of
the
order
of
confirmation.
notice
of
a
hearing
to
consider
confirmation
of
the
arrangement
was
given
by
the
bankruptcy
court
to
all
parties
in
interest,
including
mr.
raines
and
his
clients.
under
rule
77
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
as
well
as
rule
922
(a)
of
the
rules
of
bankruptcy
practice
which
became
effective
on
october
1,
1973.
there
is
no
requirement
that
notice
of
entry
be
given
and
it
specifically
states
that
lack
of
notice
of
the
entry
does
not
affect
the
time
to
appeal
or
relieve
of
authorize
the
court
to
relieve
a
body
for
failure
to
appeal
within
the
time
allowed.
the
order
of
confirmation
is
final
for
all
purposes.
distribution
has
been
made
to
creditors.
administration
expenses
have
been
paid.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
there
is.
we
were
served,
your
honor,
with
a
motion
which
i
believe
is
returnable
december
5
to
reconsider
his
clients’
claims,
and
i
will
get
to
that,
if
you
will,
your
honor.
mr.
raines
says
in
his
second
point
that
the
order
of
confirmation
was
entered
prematurely.
mr.
raines,
on
behalf
of
his
client,
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding
and
the
basis
of
the
dismissal
of
the
chapter
11
proceeding
was
that
you
could
not
have
an
arrangement
in
this
type
of
a
case.
and,
as
i
have
found
in
practicing
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
when
you
don’t
have
much
law
it
becomes
almost
academic
to
cite
pepper
v.
litton
because
the
bankruptcy
practitioners
take
the
position
that
under
pepper
v.
litton
you
could
do
anything.
well
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
by
an
order
and
an
opinion
of
referee
babbitt
dated
february
16,
1973.
and
in
the
final
paragraph
of
that
opinion,
referee
babbitt
said
“foley’s
motion
must
be
denied
in
all
respects
and
upon
this
order
becoming
final,
it
is
expected
that
blair
will
move
promptly
to
a
confirmation
of
its
arrangement.
its
creditors
have
waited
long
enough.”
subsequent
to
february
16
and
with
the
constant
prodding
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
over
9,500
claims
were
objected
to
and
resolved.
over
9,000
claims
were
expunged.
distributions
were
made
to
all
of
the
customer
creditors
during
that
period
of
time.
the
arrangement
was
confirmed
30
months
after
it
was
filed.
i
respectfully
submit
that
nobody
could
say
that
it
was
a
premature
confirmation.
further,
your
honor,
in
the
brief
in
our
position
that
we
filed
in
this
proceeding,
at
least
three
times
we
said
that
confirmation
of
the
arrangement
was
imminent
and
that
we
were
moving
towards
confirmation.
the
third
point
which
mr.
raines
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
the
proceeding
is
terminated,
your
honor.
under
the
authorities
which
we
have
cited
in
the
memorandum
suggesting
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
mr.
raines
has
reserved
his
right
to
file
an
application
for
allowance.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
mr.
raines
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
happened
to
be
in
the
courthouse
that
day
when
mr.
raines’
partner
appeared
and
i
was
called
in
by
judge
babbitt
who
asked
me
if
we
had
any
objection
if
mr.
raines
filed
his
application
subsequently.
and
i
believe
there
was
a
letter
from
the
referee
in
which
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
no,
i’m
not
certain,
your
honor,
that
i
would
agree
with
that
principle.
he’s
entitled
to
a
fee.
maybe
the
quantum
of
the
fee
would
be
different
if
he
sustained
efficiently.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
it
may
well
be,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
he
may
be
entitled
to
a
larger
fee.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
third
point
which
mr.
raines
has
raised
is
that
the
arrangement
was
voted
and
approved
by
the
slim
vote
of
general
and
secured
creditors.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
subsequent
memorandum
the
actual
findings
that
the
bankruptcy
court
made
in
respect
of
the
acceptance
of
the
plan.
and
of
the
7,633
customer
creditors
whose
claims
aggregated
$37,380,000;
6,350
customer
creditors
whose
claims
aggregated
to
$33,100,000
accept
that
the
arrangement
of
the
general
creditors,
and
93
creditors
whose
claims
totaled
$3,261,000;
66
accepted
the
arrangement
and
their
claims
aggregated
$2,800,000,
hardly
a
slim
majority.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
in
my
terms,
your
honor?
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
under
section
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
your
honor,
which
is
entitled
priorities,
the
court
is
authorized
to
allow
one
reasonable
attorney’s
fee
in
respect
of
the
attorney
for
petitioning
creditors.
my
understanding
of
the
precedence
in
connection
with
the
matter
is
if
you
sustain
the
petition,
then
you
are
entitled
to
a
greater
fee
depending
upon
the
type
of
opposition
you
met,
the
complexity
of
the
problems,
the
amount
of
time
which
was
devoted
to
it,
the
quality
of
your
opposition.
so,
there’s
a
possibility
that
he
could
be
entitled
to
a
greater
fee
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
plea.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
blair
would
pay
it,
your
honor.
it’s
an
administration
expense
and
it
would
have
to
be
paid
from
the
estate.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
doesn’t
seem
to
indicate
that.
i
wouldn’t
certainly
argue
that
in
connection
with
mr.
raines.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
well,
i
have
seen,
your
honor,
where
the
bankruptcy
court
has
given
a
token
fee
of
$100
or
$250.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
if
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
your
honor,
is
superseded
by
a
chapter
11
proceeding,
whether
there
has
been
an
adjudication
or
not.
for
example,
if
immediately
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
involuntary
petition,
without
going
to
trial
on
the
issue
of
adjudication,
blair
had
filed
a
chapter
11
proceeding
and
the
question
of
adjudication
was
never
resolved
because
you
have
a
constructive
adjudication
in
the
chapter
11
proceeding
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
would
think
not,
your
honor,
although
i
have
heard
from
mr.
raines’
respondent
for
the
contrary.
mr.
raines’
fourth
point,
your
honor,
is
in
respect
to
the
mootness
point,
is
that
i
made
a
statement
before
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
if
the
district
court
decision
was
reversed,
blair
would
move
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11.
i
never
made
any
such
statement.
his
fifth
point
is
that
80%
of
the
claims
included
in
the
schedules
of
distribution
are
subject
to
objections
as
to
allowance.
mr.
raines
pays
no
attention
to
the
fact
that
approximately
9,500
claims
were
objected
to.
trials
were
heard
before
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
those
claims
were
resolved.
moreover,
there
aren’t
objections
pending
as
80%
of
the
claims.
all
blair
did
was
reserve
its
right
to
file
objections
if
necessary.
if
blair
does
not
file
objections
within
90
days,
then
those
claims
are
allowed
automatically.
his
next
point
is
that
foley’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
petition
was
denied
by
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
who
was
strongly
influenced
by
the
decision
of
united
states
court
of
appeals.
mr.
raines
does
not
advise
the
court
in
his
memorandum
that
an
appeal
was
filed
from
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding,
was
heard
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
seventh
district
of
new
york
and
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
was
affirmed.
and
former
chief
judge
sylvester
ryan
held
that
the
grounds
argued
by
foley
for
dismissal
to
be
frivolous
and
without
merit
or
substance.
mr.
foley
never
took
an
appeal
from
that
decision
and
that
is
a
final
decision.
his
next
point
is
that
the
new
york
stock
exchange
was
being
unjustly
enriched
and
creditors
might
possibly
get
a
greater
return
in
liquidation
under
the
supervision
of
a
court
appointed
trustee.
well,
even
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
the
chapter
11
proceeding
is
finished.
besides
which,
and
specifically
provided
by
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
you
may
have
a
provision
and
an
arrangement
whereby,
on
the
confirmation
or
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding,
the
remaining
assets
of
a
debtor
are
transferred
to
a
third
party,
usually
it’s
the
party
who
put
up
the
money.
now,
in
the
case
of
bache,
the
new
york
stock
exchange
advanced
$20.4
million
to
satisfy
customer
creditor
claims
in
this
case.
the
assets
remaining
to
blair
in
no
way
measure
up
to
$20.4
million.
in
addition,
in
order
to
confirm
a
chapter
11
proceeding,
under
section
366
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
bankruptcy
court
must
make
a
determination
that
the
arrangement
is
for
the
best
interest
of
creditors.
the
phrase
“best
interest
of
creditors”
has
been
construed
to
mean
“and
require
a
determination
by
the
bankruptcy
court
that
the
creditors
will
receive
more
in
satisfaction
of
their
claims
pursuant
to
the
chapter
11
arrangement,
and
they
would
receive
in
a
liquidation
of
the
estate
in
ordinary
bankruptcy.”
and
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
and
he
made
a
finding
that
this
arrangement
was
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors
that
they
would
receive
more
under
the
arrangement
than
they
would
receive
in
the
event
of
a
liquidation
under
ordinary
bankruptcy
chapters
1
through
7.
mr.
raines’
next
point
is
that
an
adjudication
in
bankruptcy
can
be
used
as
a
fulcrum
upon
which
a
more
complete
investigation
and
interrogation
to
the
very
justice
of
the
plan
and
a
reconsideration
of
the
best
interest
of
creditors
should
be
predicated.
this
arrangement
was
proposed
by
blair
on
may
25,
1971.
mr.
foley
and
all
of
the
other
creditors
had
at
least
two-and-a-half
years
to
conduct
whatever
investigation
they
desired
for
the
terms
of
the
arrangement,
the
assets,
liabilities
or
affairs
of
blair.
in
point
of
fact,
mr.
foley,
through
his
attorneys,
conducted
extensive
examinations
of
officers,
employees
of
blair,
as
well
as
liquidator.
we
submit
that
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
are
terminated
by
the
final
order
of
confirmation.
mr.
raines
goes
on
in
his
next
point.
he
says
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
a
re-pleased
throughout
his
brief.
he
says
that
the
decision
is
a
royal
road
to
our
beacon-like
to
fraud
and
deceit
and
chicanery.
he
never
once
mentions
that
there
are
other
acts
of
bankruptcy
which
could
be
alleged.
if
blair
was
engaged
in
fraud,
if
blair
did
make
a
fraudulent
claim,
section
3
has
six
acts
of
bankruptcy.
if
he
missed
on
this
one,
he
could’ve
filed
a
petition
in
which
he
alleged
that
it
was
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
in
which
he
alleged
there
was
a
preference,
in
which
he
alleged
that
blair
admitted
in
writing
its
inability
to
pay
its
debts
as
they
matured
and
its
willingness
to
be
adjudged
the
bankrupt.
mr.
raines
has
referred
to
four-month
period.
many
of
the
acts
of
bankruptcy
in
section
3
are
not
limited
by
a
four-month
period.
a
fraudulent
conveyance
can
be
six
years
under
state
law,
new
york
state
that
is.
his
next
statement
in
which
he
persists
in
making
is
that
blair
is
guilty
of
a
giveaway
of
$100,000
which
has
never
been
pursued
or
recovered
by
the
liquidator.
that
so-called
giveaway
was
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
a
management
contract
for
the
blair
fund,
that
is,
the
position
of
mr.
foley
that
blair
should
have
received
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
that
management
contract.
subsequent
decisions
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
rosenfeld
versus
black,
have
established
now
that
you
cannot
make
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
that
contract.
in
any
event,
that
transaction
was
never
consummated.
blair
did
deposit
with
the
respective
purchaser
a
$100,000
to
serve
his
liquidated
damages
in
the
event
that
it
did
not
perform
in
accordance
with
the
contract.
mr.
foley
and
mr.
raines
keep
insisting
that
nothing
was
done
to
recover
that
$100,000.
we
have
told
mr.
raines,
we
have
told
mr.
foley
that
an
action
was
commenced
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
every
effort
was
being
made
to
recover
that
$100,000,
and
it
just
goes
over
the
waterways.
the
action
was
commenced
in
1971.
in
point
of
fact,
that
it
was
tried
three
or
four
months
ago
and
by
decision
dated
october
31,
1973
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
unfortunately,
for
the
defendant.
his
next
point
is
that
blair
seeks
--
foley,
i’m
sorry,
seeks
the
recovery
of
securities
he
deposited
with
blair
and
which
are
subordinated
to
the
claims
of
other
creditors.
this
is
not
the
first
effort
that
mr.
foley
has
made
to
recover
his
securities.
before
the
bankruptcy
proceedings,
mr.
foley
commenced
an
action
against
blair.
the
action
was
commenced
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
new
york
county.
blair
moved
to
stay
that
action
pending
arbitration.
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
supreme
court
directed
that
the
parties
proceed
to
arbitration.
mr.
foley
litigated
his
right
to
receive
back
those
securities.
he
lost
the
arbitration.
the
securities
were
deemed
to
be
the
securities
of
blair
for
the
satisfaction
of
claims
of
creditors.
the
only
reason
why
these
particular
securities
were
not
sold
is
that
they
are
unregistered
and
they’re
restricted
or
some
of
the
securities
are
subject
to
the
1%
rule.
otherwise,
they
would’ve
been
sold.
he
has
no
right
to
those
securities.
the
arbitration
award
was
confirmed
by
an
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
states
of
new
york.
mr.
foley
never
took
an
appeal
from
that
decision.
in
point
of
fact,
i
might
also
add,
that
mr.
foley
has
pending
at
the
present
time
two
plenary
actions.
he
is
suing
all
of
the
officers
and
directors
of
blair
alleging
10
(b)
(5)
violations
in
common
law
fraud,
etcetera.
he
is
also
suing
the
new
york
stock
exchange
in
a
plenary
action
in
which
he
is
asserting
that
the
new
york
stock
exchange
failed
to
exercise
and
perform
its
duties
of
self-regulation.
so,
that
point
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
this
court
may
do
with
this
particular
matter.
his
next
to
the
last
point
is
that
he
is
liable,
mr.
foley,
for
a
cause
awarded
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
there
is
an
unbroken
line
of
cases
which
establishes
the
rule
that
controversy
as
to
cause
alone
does
not
salvage
an
otherwise
moot
the
case.
and
the
lead
case
is
walling
versus
reuter
&
co.,
321
u.s.
671,
and
other
cases
are
cited
in
the
footnote
of
mr.
justice
fortas
in
the
bank
of
marin
case.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don’t
see
that
mr.
raines
is
in
any
event
or
position
to
change
this
controversy
from
one
which
is
moot
simply
because
he
has
an
interest
in
getting
a
fee
out
of
this
case.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
he
wants
a
fee
out
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
that’s
a
cost
of
the
administration
of
the
proceeding,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
and
i
don’t
think
it
changes
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
it’s
a
cause
and
--
i
suppose
we’d
state
an
ordinary
bankruptcy,
your
honor.
it’s
a
cost
of
--
i
would
put
that
in
the
same
category
as
the
course
which
was
set
by
the
court
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i’m
not
quite
sure
of
that
volume,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
right.
if
i
understand
what
your
honor
is
saying
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
understand
what
your
honor
is
saying,
your
honor
is
saying
that
even
though
the
matter
may
be
moot,
the
fact
that
an
attorney
has
a
fee
involved
in
it
may
change
that
from
being
a
moot
matter.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
well,
i
don’t
know
what
arrangements
mr.
raines
may
have
made
with
his
client.
he
may
have
a
contingent
fee
basis.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
no,
the
act
reads
in
those
terms,
your
honor,
but
the
application
is
made
by
the
attorney
and
the
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
well
as
the
act
reads,
your
honor
--
the
act,
as
i
recall
it
says
that
the
petitioning
creditor
shall
be
reimbursed
for
the
fees
which
they
may
have
paid
to
their
attorneys.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
which
i
would
argue,
your
honor,
it’s
a
cost
of
the
proceeding
and,
in
fact,
i
would
say
this
petition
was
filed
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
of
this
particular
proceeding,
no,
your
honor.
the
last
statement
or
the
last
point
that
mr.
raines
makes
is
that
the
situation
is
a
scandal.
i
don’t
think
i
have
any
words
which
can
respond
to
that
argument.
i
might
point
out,
your
honor,
that
when
this
petition
in
bankruptcy,
this
involuntary
petition
in
bankruptcy
was
filed
there
were
28,000
customers
of
blair
who
had
their
securities
and
their
credit
balances
at
blair.
if
this
proceeding
had
gone
through
involuntary
bankruptcy
proceedings
under
chapters
1
through
7
and
mr.
foley
made
an
application
for
the
appointment
of
a
receiver
which
was
denied
by
the
district
court,
the
fees
which
would’ve
been
paid
out
of
this
estate
and
there
would’ve
been
receivers,
attorneys,
accountants,
disbursing
agents,
etcetera
would’ve
exceeded
$7
million
based
upon
the
properties
which
were
in
the
possession
of
blair
at
the
time
that
the
petition
was
filed.
we
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors,
that
this
case
is
moot
irrespective
of
what
the
court
may
do.
and
i
certainly
would
not
favor
the
court
reversing
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
which
events,
your
honor?
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
although
we
did
argue
in
our
position
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
could
mention
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
think
a
remand
might
be
appropriate,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
at
the
time
that
the
second
circuit
decided
it,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
was
still
pending,
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
proceeding.
assuming
that
mr.
raines
and
mr.
foley
had
been
successful
in
dismissing
the
chapter
11
proceeding,
we
would’ve
had
to
rely
upon
the
dismissal
of
the
ordinary
bankruptcy
petition.
we
were
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
the
fees
that
would’ve
been
paid
out
of
this
estate
would’ve
made
it
impossible
to
satisfy
customer
claimants
in
full.
it
would’ve
required
$35
million
in
order
to
have
accomplished
that
fact.
we
believe
that
the
decision,
the
order
of
confirmation
which
was
not
appealed
from
and
which,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
mr.
raines
knew
it
was
coming
on
to
be
heard.
he’s
been
following
this
proceeding.
his
partner
checks
the
docket
all
the
time.
it
was
a
resignation
on
his
part.
and
moreover,
he
never
took
an
appeal
from
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
chapter
11
petition
in
which
he
raised
exactly
the
same
points
he
is
raising
in
his
motion
upcoming
on
in
december,
your
honor.
and
i
might
add,
if
i
--
if
your
honor
will,
i
will
go
into
the
case
in
point
the
merits
of
this
matter.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
appointment
of
an
agent
to
liquidate
property
who,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
points
out,
has
no
right
--
has
no
powers
over
creditors.
he
cannot
affect
creditors.
mr.
justice
white
asked
“could
we
stay
broker
dealers
who
did
business
with
blair?”
we
could
not
stay
them.
the
only
grounds
that
blair
might
have
had
to
stay
a
plenary
action
was
that
there
was
an
arbitration
contract
and
compelled
to
whoever
was
suing
blair
to
go
into
arbitration
under
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
but
that’s
only
as
to
member
firms.
if
an
over-the-counter
broker
had
sued
blair,
there
would
be
a
plenary
action.
we
had
absolutely
no
power
to
deal
with
creditors.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
of
the
exchange?
no,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
only
because
there
was
the
arbitration
contract
between
blair
and
there
were
many
--
in
fact,
at
the
time
of
the
appointment
of
the
liquidator,
there
were
many
plenary
actions
pending.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
sir?m
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
exactly,
your
honor.
and,
in
effect
what
would
happen
upon
the
appointment
of
receiver
would
be
that
the
property
would
past
into
custodial
legist
and
creditors
would
be
constrained
to
file
claims
with
the
receiver
and
they
would
share
pro
rata.
this
is
exactly
the
point
in
bonnie
classics
which
is
relied
on
very
heavily
by
referee
herzog
and
judge
cooper.
in
the
case
of
bonnie
classics,
when
the
corporation
decided
to
liquidate
under
the
new
york
stock
corporation
law,
the
board
of
directors
became
vested
with
title
as
trustees
and
creditors
were
restrained
from
proceeding
against
the
property
of
the
corporation.
they
had
to
wait
until
the
assets
were
liquidated,
the
trust
rates
were
distributed.
every
case
in
which
it
has
been
held
that
there
is
a
receiver
or
a
trustee
appointed
under
3
(a)
(5),
there
has
been
an
inhibition
against
the
creditors
proceeding.
this
was
not
the
case
in
connection
with
blair.
in
fact,
there
is
a
district
court
case
in
ray
ambrose
matthews
and
co.
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
in
which
there
was
a
similar
type
agreement.
and
the
court
held,
and
this
is
a
district
court
decision
in
new
jersey,
as
the
instrument
brought
about
no
change
in
title
to
the
property,
either
absolute
or
condition,
nothing
was
conveyed
nor
transferred
by
it
and
it
could
not
hinder,
delay,
or
defraud
creditors
because
any
creditor
could
proceed
to
satisfy
his
claim
from
the
corporation’s
property
to
the
same
extent
as
though
the
instrument
did
not
exist.
that
is
exactly
the
situation
which
occurred
in
connection
with
blair.
essentially,
mr.
scorese
was
an
agent
of
the
board
of
directors
of
blair.
he
had
no
greater
powers
than
the
board
of
directors
had
and
he
dealt
with
the
property.
in
fact,
he
could
be
removed
by
blair.
all
blair
had
to
do
at
that
point
in
time
was
pay
back
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
$1,000
and
mr.
scorese’s
appointment
was
vacated.
and
i
might
add
on
the
$1,000,
your
honor,
it’s
simply
a
question
in
order
to
trigger
the
appointment
of
a
liquidator,
the
exchange
had
to
advance
some
money.
eventually,
$20.4
million
came
into
this
case.
now,
in
connection
with
the
merits
of
the
matter,
under
section
3
(a)
(5),
the
statute
is
very
specific
in
talking
about
a
receiver
or
a
trustee.
it’s
our
position
that
the
receiver
or
trustee
must
be
judicially
appointed
or
appointed
pursuant
to
a
statute.
and
mr.
raines
has
alluded
to
the
development
of
section
3
(a)
(5).
we
have
set
forth
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
how
the
statute
was
developed.
the
point
which
is
relied
upon
very
heavily
by
the
petitioners
here
is
that
in
the
1926
amendment
to
section
3
(a)
(5),
the
words
“appointed
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
any
state
or
territory”
were
deleted.
as
chief
judge
friendly
has
noted
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
elimination
of
those
words
were
described
in
the
house
report
as
only
a
phraseology
and
there
was
no
intent
to
change
the
substance
of
the
statute.
and
chief
judge
friendly
has
gone
into
great
detail
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history.
furthermore,
when
congress
intended
to
use
the
language
“an
agent
authorized
to
liquidate
property,”
and
congress
has
used
that
language
in
section
2
(a)
(21)
which
was
amended
as
part
of
the
or
brought
into
the
bankruptcy
act
as
part
of
a
chandler
act
of
1938,
it
specifically
refers
to
an
agent
to
authorized
to
liquidate
property.
in
1952,
the
statute
was
amended
again
section
69
(d)
and
that
language
was
put
into
the
statute.
in
69
(d),
the
statute
puts
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
an
agent
authorized
to
liquidate
for
the
purposes
of
accounting.
we
submit
on
the
basis
of
the
amendments
in
the
legislative
history
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
include
as
an
act
of
bankruptcy
the
appointment
of
an
agent
authorized
to
liquidate,
it
would’ve
said
so,
as
chief
judge
friendly
has
pointed
out.
we
believe
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
legislature
to
deal
with,
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
presently
pending
before
the
house
and
before
the
senate
a
new
bankruptcy
act
h.r.
10792
which
is
legislatively
going
to
change
the
acts
of
bankruptcy
and
will
include
in
those
acts
of
bankruptcy
an
agent
authorized
to
liquidate
property.
on
the
basis
of
that,
we
submit
that
this
is
something
that
should
be
left
to
the
legislature.
this
court
should
not
enlarge
section
3
(a)
(5)
so
that
a
petition
can
be
filed
simply
because
an
agent
is
appointed
to
liquidate.
filing
a
bankruptcy
petition
is
not
a
matter
which
should
be
taken
lightly.
there
are
many,
many
factors
that
are
involved.
there
are
many,
many
people
that
are
affected
by
the
filing
of
the
petition.
in
this
case,
customs
were
adversely
affected.
securities
and
exchange
commission
issued
a
release
in
which
they
pointed
out
that
the
administration
of
these
proceedings
had
caused
an
additional
$5
million
by
reason
of
a
bankruptcy
petition.
they
criticized
the
filing
of
the
petition
and
the
allowance
of
the
commission.
this
is
a
situation
which,
frankly,
i
was
little
surprised
to
be
here
this
morning.
i
was
sure
that
this
is
a
case
that
requires
no
further
action
by
any
court.
the
case
is
finished.
the
customers
have
been
satisfied.
the
creditors
have
received
the
distribution
to
the
extent
their
claims
have
been
allowed.
and
very
substantial
administration
expenses
have
already
been
paid
out.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
i
have
no
objection
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
your
honor,
i
would
say,
in
case
of
a
particular
situation
that
has
come
before
the
court
today,
this
will
never
happen
again.
mr.
raines
has
quoted
a
specific
act.
he
has
misquoted
it.
where
a
member
firm
or
any
broker
dealer
who’s
registered
under
the
34
act
incurs
financial
difficulties
of
one
type
or
another
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
yes,
it’s
an
obligation
of
the
exchange
to
advise
to
the
sec
and
then
an
application
is
made
by
subject
for
the
appointment
of
a
trustee.
this
situation
could
never
arise
again
in
connection
with
member
firms.
so
that
it’s
really
a
sui
generis
case
and
it
does
not
establish
a
precedent
which
is
going
to
do
harm
to
the
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
hopefully,
we’re
going
to
have
a
new
bankruptcy
act
that’s
called
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1973
in
the
house
bill.
hopefully,
it
will
be
passed
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
well,
i’m
afraid,
your
honor,
that
the
--
mr.
harvey
r.
miller
the
treasury
department
may
have
some
objections
to
it.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
