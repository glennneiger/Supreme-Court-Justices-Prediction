justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
did
have
notice
of
the
proceeding
at
which
it
was
going
to

which
the
thing
was
being
taken
out,
didn’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn’t
it
a
practice
if
once
you
appear
and
sign
up
as
one
of
the
interested
parties
before
the
referee,
that
you
get
notices
of
postponement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it’s
clearly
settled
that
a
cost
outstanding
don’t
prevent
something
from
becoming
moot,
i
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn’t
prevent
him
from
being
moot
even
if
it’s
totally
100%
wrong.
the
case
might
still
be
moot.
justice
william

well,
if
you’re
totally

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
who
pays
it
if
there’s
no
adjudication
of

justice
william

rehnquist
if
the
adjudication
has
resolved
adversely
to
the
petitioning
creditor,
then
there’s
no
question
of
the
fee.

mr.
miller.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
am
i
right
in
thinking,
under
new
york
law,
that
if
there
had
been
a
state
court
receiver
appointed
then
the
remedies
of
the
creditors
would’ve
had
to
be
directed
against
the
receiver
rather
than
against
blair?
