unknown
speaker
did
he
have
any
powers
vis-a-vis
the
creditors
of
blair
&
co.
that
blair
&
co.
itself
would
not
have
had?
unknown
speaker
that
was
my
question.
unknown
speaker
just
as
blair
&
co.
itself
could’ve
done
before
his
appointment.
unknown
speaker
and
he
didn’t
have
any
special
defense
as
to
any
creditor’s
claims
that
blair
&
co.
would
not
have
any
--
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
were
another
member
of
the
exchange
and
you
wanted
to
get
after
blair,
and
the
exchange
liquidator
was
in
charge?
unknown
speaker
could
you
go
to
court
or
would
the
exchange
provide
--
expect
you
to
deal
with
their
liquidator?
unknown
speaker
but
an
ordinary
non-exchange
creditor
wouldn’t
have
been
barred
from
suing
blair
&
co.
in
the
court.
unknown
speaker
just
by
the
appointment
of
a
liquidator.
unknown
speaker
but
an
exchange
member
might.
unknown
speaker
well,
somewhat.
i
just
wondered
if,
briefly,
whether
you
thought
the
liquidator
had
any
power
to
keep
exchange
members
rescind
--
unknown
speaker
you
just
don’t
know.
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
part
of
a
self-governing
mechanism
that
is
authorized
by
statute.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
raines,
your
time
is
running.
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
effect
of
the
chapter
11
proceedings
on
the
issue
that
you’re
bringing?
unknown
speaker
was
the
order
on
appeal
at
all?
unknown
speaker
is
the
order
of
confirmation
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
pending?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
it
isn’t
though.
that
it’s
a
perfectly
normal
chapter
11
and
it
is
a
final
order
of
chapter
11
and
that
that
proceeding
is
over.
would
you
still
contend
that
this
case
is
not
moot?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can’t
--
there
isn’t
going
to
be
an
adjudication
now,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
in
a
place
of
a
chapter
11
confirmation?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
it
be?
unknown
speaker
can
it
be
an
adjudication
until
its
set
aside?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
normally
chapter
11
proceedings
--
well,
often,
chapter
11
proceedings
superseded
bankruptcy
adjudication.
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
do
attorneys
for
petitioning
creditors
in
an
involuntary
bankruptcy
proceeding
--
are
they
normally
allowed
fees?
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
petition
alleging
an
act
of
bankruptcy
that
turns
out
not
to
be
an
act
of
bankruptcy,
you
may
not
get
fees.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that’s
--
and
the
attorneys
for
petitioning
creditor
in
an
involuntary
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
entitled
to
fees.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
proceeding
is
superseded
by
a
chapter
11
case
--
unknown
speaker
he
is
still
entitled
to
fees.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
is
superseded
by
a
chapter
11
proceeding
and
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
--
unknown
speaker
--
itself
was
invalid,
you
may
not
be
entitled
to
fees?
unknown
speaker
is
that
enough
to
--
unknown
speaker
is
that
enough
to
make
this
case
not
moot?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
--
a
while
ago,
you
answered
that
if
you
were
entitled
to
fees
in
the
involuntary
bankruptcy
proceeding,
if
you
were,
and
then
a
chapter
11
proceeding
came
along.
the
chapter
11
proceeding
would
have
to
recognize
your
claim
to
fees.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
in
our
view
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
but
the
chapter
11
proceedings
must
pick
up
the
estate’s
obligations
to
you
for
fees.
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
your
opinion,
but
is
it
the
law?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don’t
get
them
unless
this
was
an
act
of
bankruptcy?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don’t
want
to
--
unknown
speaker
well,
what
it
did
--
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
it
was
in
fact
an
act
of
bankruptcy,
then
you’re
home
free
on
fees,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
if
you
only
get
--
you
get
it
only
if
--
unknown
speaker
and
only
if
it
is
an
act
--
only
if
you
win
on
this
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
status
of
the
motion?
mr.
raines
mentioned
a
motion
to
set
aside
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
--
well,
i’ll
ask
you.
do
you
think
it
will
have
any
impact
whatsoever
on
the
finality
of
the
confirmation
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
reversed?
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
because
the
case
--
you
think
the
case
is
moot.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
fee
question?
unknown
speaker
but
the
confirmation
in
paying
administrative
expenses
did
not
schedule
his
fee
claim.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
he’s
not
entitled
to
his
fees
unless
this
was
an
act
of
bankruptcy.
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
it
would
be
for
a
moment.
unknown
speaker
if
this
is
a
valid
act
of
bankruptcy
--
i
mean,
if
this
was
an
act
of
bankruptcy
and
he
was
entitled
to
have
an
involuntary
adjudication,
he
is
entitled
to
fees.
unknown
speaker
and
as
an
expense
of
administration
of
the
chapter
11
proceeding
would
have
to
recognize.
unknown
speaker
who
pays
him?
unknown
speaker
who
pays
him?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
goes
with
attorney’s
fees?
unknown
speaker
or
in
fact,
he
might
effect
it
on
his
client,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
his
client
--
he
might
have
left
for
his
client.
it
is
the
client
that
has
the
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
there’s
a
chapter
11
proceeding
here.
unknown
speaker
it
isn’t
an
attorney’s
fee
--
it
isn’t
an
issue
of
attorney’s
fees
in
this
litigation
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
attorney’s
fee
is
not
in
connection
with
these
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
in
connection
with
proceedings
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
client
--
the
client
has
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it’s
the
petitioning
creditor
that
gives
the
fee,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it’s,
nevertheless,
the
petitioning
creditor.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
cost
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
it
is
not
a
cost
of
this
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
mr.
miller,
of
course
all
of
these
events
have
arisen
since
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
haven’t
they?
unknown
speaker
this
issue
of
mootness.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i’m
just
wondering
whether
what
view
the
court
of
appeals
might
take
in
this
issue.
unknown
speaker
should
we
decide
it
or
should
we
let
them
take
a
crack
at
it
first?
unknown
speaker
but
the
liquidator
did
have
some
powers
vis-a-vis
other
people
--
vis-a-vis
members.
unknown
speaker
he
could
perhaps,
keep
them
from
going
into
court
directly.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
do
you
realize
that
our
practice
is,
here,
if
we
hold
the
case
moot,
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
then,
you
wouldn’t
have
no
authoritative
decision
in
the
second
circuit
with
respect
to
whether
this
was
an
act
of
bankruptcy.
unknown
speaker
not
a
new
statute?
unknown
speaker
how
many
years
in
the
1970s?
unknown
speaker
in
the
80’s?
unknown
speaker
did
he
have
any
powers
vis-a-vis
the
creditors
of
blair
&
