mr.
morton
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly,
if
the
court
please
to
the
general
approach
taken
by
the
board,
arguing
in
support
of
its
point
of
view
with
respect
to
the
two
specific
limitations
on
its
power.
i'm
speaking
of
the
limitation
contents
in
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
itself.
the
limitations
contained
in
rule
65
particularly
65
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
i
think
those
limitations
are
the
ones
that
the
board
has
attempted
to
dispense
with
in
reaching
the
result
that
it's
reached
in
this
case
on
a
successorship
issue
which
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
board
and
the
writers
tend
to
sweep
these
limitations
aside.
of
course
the
10
(c)
the
heart
of
that
again
is
that
states
that
the
board's
remedial
powers
must
be
exercised
only
against
those
who
have
actually
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practices
or
are
engaging
in
them.
and
the
language
of
section
65
(d)
which
had
such
penetrating
analysis
in
the
regal
knitwear
case
has
to
do
with
the
circumstances
under
which
a
successor
or
an
assigned
maybe
drawn
within
the
ambit
of
an
order
directed
to
a
wrong
doer.
now,
as
i
see
the
board
tends
to
shut
these
off
really
by
saying,
first
it
is
also
in
the
same
section
10
(c)
given
broad
remedial
powers
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
and
consider
them
in
light
of
this.
at
the
end,
it
has
in
mind
really
justifies
the
means
as
taken.
and
it
tends
to
treat
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
two
sections
i
just
mentioned
as
something
rather
technical
or
rather
arbitrary
and
arbitrary
but
technical
at
any
rate,
and
something
that
must
give
away
before
an
argument
addressed
to
considerations
of
substance
such
as
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
act.
in
answer
to
that,
i
would
say
it
first
and
i
think
again
this
is
fundamental.
that
both
of
these
sections
are
not
technical.
their
terms
and
body
provisions
are
of
fundamental
substance
and
they
articulate
fundamental
protections.
i
think
throughout
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
affording
a
party
hearing,
yes.
and
that
one
of
the
vices
inherent
in
what
the
board
has
done
is
to
deny
a
party
a
hearing,
but
even
more
fundamental
than
that
and
even
more
profound
a
vice
is
the
vice
which
lies
in
imposing
sanctions
for
illegal
conduct
for
wrong
doing
against
the
party
who
is
guiltless
of
any
wrong
doing
who
is
totally
innocent
of
any
wrongful
conduct.
this
is
what
we
are
getting
at.
so
these
are
not
just
technical
limitations,
they're
limitations
which
contain
the
expression,
the
embodiment
of
protections
of
considerable
substance
and
can't
simply
be
swept
aside.
this
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
think
not
your
honor.
it
certainly
was
--
sort
of
went
without
saying
in
the
regal
knitwear
case.
the
language
successors
and
the
signs
is
regularly
been
used
in
these
orders
and
that
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
this
is
true,
but
i
think
that
what
the
court
addressed
itself
to
in
the
regal
knitwear
case
was
the
fact
that
the
courts
are
going
to
be
called
upon
to
enforce
these
orders
and
what
justice
jackson
said
in
regal
knitwear
was
that
no
order
can
be
enforced,
no
order
which
contains
language
which
exceeds
the
limitations
of
rule
65
(d)
can
be
enforced
by
a
court.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
court's
enforcement
powers
are
limited,
quite
clearly
they
apply
to
the
labor
board
also.
however,
an
answer
to
each
of
these
considerations
if
each
on
its
merit
that
the
board
is
advanced
is
again
contained
in
this
very
remarkable
decision
in
the
regal
knitwear
case.
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
first
off
to
a
very
transient
statement
of
policy
made
by
the
court
in
the
southern
steamship
case,
where
it
says
it
is
sufficient
for
this
case,
this
court
speaking
again
on
this
and
justifying
the
means
argument.
it
is
sufficient
for
this
case
to
observe
that
the
board
has
not
been
commissioned
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
so
single-mindedly
that
it
may
ignore
the
equally
important
congressional
objectives.
justice
jackson
echoes
this
sentiment
when
he
says
in
regal
knitwear
that
this
language
about
broader
media
powers
in
order
to
effectuate
policies
of
the
act
containing
its
own
limitation.
he
points
out
in
the
following
language
that
these
powers
must
be
exercised
within
the
limits
of
the
authority
bestowed
by
the
statute.
administrative
agencies
have
considerable
latitude
to
shape
their
remedies
within
the
scope
of
their
statutory
authority.
and
then
it
goes
on
the
say
the
courts
may
not
grant
in
the
celebrated
language
an
enforcement
order
or
an
injunction
so
broad
as
to
make
punishable,
a
conduct
the
persons
who
act
independently
and
whose
rights
have
not
been
adjudged
according
to
law.
now,
again
it
is
suggested
that
by
the
writers
and
notably
professor
goldberg
and
the
north
western
law
review
who
was
cited
by
board
and
its
brief
at
page
21
and
indeed
whose
views
find
reflections
throughout
on
the
board's
brief
that
regal
knitwear
doesn't
really
mean
what
it
says,
and
in
any
event
it
has
left
the
door
open
by
language
in
giving
two
examples.
the
court
gives
two
examples,
it
suggests
for
example
the
successive
concept
could
apply
in
a
situation
where
the
successor
was
merely
a
disguised
continuance
of
the
predecessor,
and
therefore
has
a
substantial
identity
with
him
or
where
the
succession
itself,
the
transfer
has
been
utilized
simply
as
a
means
of
evading
or
avoiding
trust
to
the
force
of
the
order.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct.
the
successor
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
and
that
is
not
disputed
as
far
as
the
predecessor
is
concerned.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
--
mr.
morton
jackson
we
do
not
dispute
that
personal
method
of
computation
has
been
disputed.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
assumed
specified
obligations
only.
there
were
certain
specified
obligations
set
out
in
the
sale
agreement
and
it
assumed
only
though
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
customary.
this
was
an
asset
purchase
your
honor.
it
was
not
a
merger,
not
a
statutory
merger
such
as
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
certain
specified
obligations
only.
the
successor
did
all
american
and
these
were
specifically
enumerated,
this
particular
item
was
not
one
of
them.
the
predecessor
--
mr.
morton
jackson
no,
i
think
under
the
cases
we've
cited
that
for
this
particular
type
of
obligation
the
reverse
would
be
truly
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
morton
jackson
under
state
law,
yes.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct.
even
--
mr.
morton
jackson
we've
cited
one
case
in
our
brief
is
--
mr.
morton
jackson
not
the
seller,
not
the
seller.
i
beg
our
pardon
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
the
seller
certainly
cannot
avoid.
mr.
morton
jackson
not
if
a
lien
has
not
been
established
against
those
assets
prior
to
the
time
they
conveyed.
mr.
morton
jackson
if
it's
a
fraudulent
conveyance
--
if
the
conveyance
is
made
with
the
intent
of
defrauding
creditors
your
honor,
i
think
indeed
and
the
purchaser
is
not
an
innocent
purchaser
and
is
a
party
that,
i
think
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
and
we
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
the
predecessor
had
other
business
interests.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
--
did
not
go
out
of
business,
it
had
other
interest
they
were
not
in
the
soft
drink
field.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
did
not
include
an
agreement
indemnify
as
such
your
honor.
it
includes,
mr.
chief
justice
the
customary
warranty
against
the
pending
litigation
and
against
all
litigation
except
that
specifically
disclosed
to
the
purchaser.
as
the
record
discloses,
in
this
case
the
pendency
of
this
litigation
had
slipped
everybody’s
mind,
and
was
not
specified
in
the
agreement.
so
it's
pendency
and
the
liability
attaching,
would
ordinarily
constitute
a
breach
of
that
warrant,
a
giving
rise
to
--
mr.
morton
jackson
well,
as
between
the
parties,
any
liability
that
was
imposed
against
all
american
would
be
the
subject
of
indemnification
by
golden
state
to
the
extent
that
all
american
was
held
liable,
yes.
i
believe
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
morton
jackson
i
should
say
it
was
contractual
and
that
it
stands
from
the
breach
of
that
warranty.
thus,
if
all
americans
suffered
financial
loss
of
any
kind
as
a
consequence
of
the
existence
of
litigation
which
had
been
warranted
not
to
exist,
i
take
it
that
the
golden
state
bottling
co.
would
have
to
indemnify
for
it,
or
against
that
loss.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
you
honor,
in
the
course
--
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
post
burns
in
the
court
of
appeals
after
the
briefs
were
filed,
i
believe
--
the
burns
case
was
i
believe
was
dealt
with
in
the
briefs
and
it
was
a
subject
--
with
the
court.
mr.
morton
jackson
i
did
not
myself
read
burns
as
having
a
bearing
on
the
successor’s
obligation
to
hire
a
predecessor’s
employees
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
point
was
not
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
think
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
i
don't
read
burns
is
changing
that
the
successor
is
under
no
obligation
other
things
being
equal
to
hire
any
other's
predecessors
employees
that
if
i
may
cite
a
case
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
believe
so,
and
there
is
the
tri-state
maintenance
case
which
rejected
a
counter
suggestion
by
the
board
and
the
board
has
since
taken
that
view
that
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
successor
other
things
being
equal
to
hire
any
of
the
employees
of
the
predecessor.
i
believe
mr.
come
will
concur
with
that
view,
and
i'd
be
happy
to
cite
for
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
yes.
mr.
morton
jackson
no,
i
believe
not.
mr.
morton
jackson
because
the
unfair
practice
remained
un-remedied
in
this
respect.
and
because
the
successor
is
the
only
party
capable
of
fulfilling
the
remedy
in
this
aspect,
then
it
must
be
against
this
party
that
this
aspect
to
the
remedy
is
invoked.
the
board
does
not
consider
and
this
of
course
goes
only
to
the
reinstatement
aspect
of
it.
this
argument
of
course
does
not
pertain
to
the
financial
aspect
of
it,
the
back
pay
aspect
of
it.
at
least
certainly
not
as
to
that
portion
of
it
that
accrued
up
to
the
time
of
sale.
there
is
again
a
question
as
to
whether
the
successor
should
be
liable
for
all
of
the
back
pay
liability
even
before
the
time
of
sale.
this
is
not
the
right
way
of
looking
at
it.
have
i
answered
your
honor's
question?
mr.
morton
jackson
well,
this
again
it
has
to
do
with
the
obligation
of
bargain
and
i
think
the
two
can't
be
--
mr.
morton
jackson
well
this
is
true.
at
burns
--
mr.
morton
jackson
yes
indeed,
but
then
again
would
be
a
matter
of
contract
your
honor
which
does
not
bear
upon
the
present
case.
now,
burns
was
considered
as
having
some
bearing
in
this
case
since
it
threw
light
upon
the
significance
of
the
wiley
against
livingston
decision
on
which
the
board
in
turn
based
its
change
of
course
in
perma
vinyl.
and
burns
was
read
by
judge
kilkenny
who
dissented
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
narrowing
the
scope
of
wiley
in
its
application
to
this
type
of
case,
and
in
fact
excluding
its
application
to
cases
involving
liability
for
unfair
practices
as
distinct
from
the
succession
to
the
obligation
of
bargain,
or
the
obligation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
resulted
from
a
bargaining
arrangement
of
the
predecessor.
to
return
to
the
point
i
was
making
the
argument
of
justice
jackson
or
the
language
of
justice
jackson.
he
touched
down,
i
think
is
found
as
i
say,
professor
goldberg
suggests
that
there
is
an
open
door
which
leaves
it
wide
open
for
other
situations
including
the
one
before
us
that
of
an
innocent
successor.
but
we
suggest
that
is
foreclosed
by
the
language
of
the
succeeding
paragraph
in
which
he
points
out
the
common
aspect
to
both
of
these
examples
he
is
given.
he
says
"in
both
of
these
cases,
the
reference
is
not
merely
to
succession,
but
to
a
relation
between
the
defendant
and
the
successor
which
might
of
itself
establish
liability
within
the
terms
of
rule
65."
we
suggest
we
urge
to
the
court
that
that
says
plainly
as
anything
could
that
an
innocent
successor
as
against
to
him,
there
is
no
independent
basis
for
assessing
liability
who's
guilty
of
no
wrong.
who
is
not
in
the
league
with
the
predecessor
or
assisting
him
to
evade
the
order
or
conspiring
with
him
in
a
collusive
manner
to
carry
out
this
type
of
conduct.
the
term
successor
on
a
sign
cannot
reach
out
and
bind
such
a
person,
because
to
do
so
would
be
offensive
to
due
process,
and
to
exceed
the
scope
of
that
section.
we
urge
therefore
that
these
limitations
are
limitations
of
substance
and
cannot
be
swept
aside
or
cannot
be
ignored
in
view
of
the
other
limited
considerations
which
the
board
has
advanced.
and
may
suggest
that
to
do
so,
amounts
really
to
an
exultation
not
merely
a
form,
but
of
doctrine,
at
the
sacrifice
of
fundamental
law
and
of
substantive
right.
if
i
may
briefly
address
myself
to
1
or
2
of
the
practical
or
what
we
called
in
our
brief,
the
policy
considerations
--
by
the
board.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
if
i
may
that
the
enforcement
of
the
reinstatement
remedy
whether
it's
against
a
original
employer,
this
is
a
well
settled
remedy
and
one
with
which
we
have
no
quarrel.
but
in
any
event,
and
particularly
against
a
successor
who
as
we
see
has
other
than
being
no
obligation
whatever
to
hire
any
of
his
predecessor's
employers.
it
does
work
a
hardship
on
the
innocent
employee
who
has
to
be
displaced
to
make
way
for
the
rehired
discriminatee.
the
argument
is
frequently
seen
only
from
the
stand
point
of
the
discriminatee
who
is
out
of
a
job,
who
wants
to
be
reinstated,
and
who
is
now
remedied
less
because
the
business
has
changed
counts.
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
order
to
accommodate
even
a
respect,
somebody
else
is
going
to
have
to
be
laid
off.
also
the
argument
that
a
successor
can
hire
and
that
will
work
no
hardship,
and
then
if
he
proves
to
be
a
non-satisfactory
employee,
may
fire
him
for
cause.
in
such
circumstances
where
the
board
tends
to
try
as
it's
indicated
in
this
case
must
frequently
attempted
to
establish
as
board
policy,
a
presumption
that
the
successor
is
going
to
continue
the
unfair
practices
of
the
predecessor.
and
given
the
burden
which
the
employer
has
under
this
court's
great
dane
case
to
in
effect
establish
that
this
discriminatory
reason
was
not
the
reason
for
the
discharge.
i
think
this
is
not
a
realistic
argument,
because
with
the
tract
record
such
as
this,
which
is
going
to
be
raised
against
him,
a
successes
is
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
time
discharging
for
cause
and
making
it
stand
up
against
an
8
(a)
(3)
charge
a
purely
practical
matter.
this
is
the
way
it
works.
also,
by
insisting
on
this
type
of
remedial
action,
we
should
like
to
suggest
again
that
a
practical
result
if
this
were
to
become
settled
policy.
that
successors
would
in
examining
this,
to
the
extent
that
they
were
aware
of
it,
would
be
more
inclined
to
other
things
being
equal
to
hire
none
of
the
predecessor's
employees,
and
instead
of
promoting
stability,
he
is
likely
to
promote
just
the
opposite
result
in
order
to
avoid
being
classified
as
a
successor,
or
in
order
to
avoid
being
projected
in
to
this
uncertain
and
potentially
expensive
situation.
i
think
to
most
of
the
further
questions,
i
would
conclude
with
that
to
open
end,
if
the
court
please,
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
reply.
mr.
morton
jackson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
like
to
correct
a
misstatement
of
the
fact.
quite
unintentional
i'm
sure
on
the
part
of
mr.
come.
there
was
another
union
here,
the
issue
one
of
the
issues
in
the
original
unfair
practice
case
is
the
question
of
domination
of
that
union
which
has
resolved.
mr.
morton
jackson
and
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
was
no
issue
as
to
the
obligation
of
the
successor
to
abide
by
it,
the
successor
of
the
organization
did.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes
we
did.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
not
one
of
the
specific
obligations
assumed
as
i
recall.
i'm
--
mr.
morton
jackson
it
just
simply
assumed
the
obligations
under
the
old
one.
mr.
morton
jackson
and
continued
right
on
with
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
don't
honestly
recall
your
honor
exactly
what
it
did
provide
in
this
respect.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
so
it
--
mr.
morton
jackson
well,
i
mean
it
was
not
major
issue
below.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
it
cannot
be
an
issue
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
believe
not.
mr.
morton
jackson
because
i
believe
that
the
assumption
of
the
agreement
was
not
a
matter
of
the
sale
contract,
it
was
a
voluntary
assumption
by
the
successor
after
having
taken
over,
but
i
think
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
think
that's
undoubtedly
true.
after
those
obligations
attached
and
after
we
would
assume
them
without
question
if
the
–-
mr.
morton
jackson
if
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
workforce
and
we
had
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
we
had
assumed
attempted
to
discharge
him
without
cause,
it
would've
given
rise
to
a
cause
of
grievance
under
the
contract
without
question.
mr.
morton
jackson
he
was
indeed.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
an
independent
union,
yes.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
and
the
original
case,
which
largely
disposed
off
those
domination
charges.
the
origin
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
your
honor
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
original
case.
the
discharge
was
an
issue
in
that,
but
it
was
not
one
of
the
principal
issues.
mr.
morton
jackson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
i
believe
not.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
if
i
may,
in
the
time
remaining
to
address
myself
to
the
two
questions
posed
by
mr.
justice
white.
first,
the
question
of
the
significance
of
the
burn’s
case
in
this
case,
and
judge
wiley,
or
judge
kilkenny's
reliance
upon
it.
we
have
prefaces
by
recalling
that
the
board’s
original
position
was
premised
on
wiley,
or
in
the
regal
knitwear
and
the
symns
grocer
decision
of
the
board
was
premised
on
regal
knitwear
and
the
birdsall-stockdale
cases
that
came
as
a
consequence
of
it.
the
change
of
position
in
perma
vinyl
in
the
board's
rationale
did
not
deal
with
these
cases
but
went
instead
to
the
language
of
wiley
to
support
its
change
of
course.
burns
contained
language
which
suggested
that
wiley
did
not
support
that
view,
in
this
language.
we
do
not
find
wiley
controlling
in
the
circumstances
here.
wiley
arouse
in
the
context
of
the
section
301
suit
to
compel
arbitration,
not
in
the
context
of
an
unfair
practice
proceeding
where
the
board
is
expressly
limited
by
the
provisions
of
section
8
(d)
the
decision
emphasized
the
preference
of
national
labor
policy
for
arbitration
as
a
substitute
for
a
test
of
strength
and
so
forth.
but
that
language
in
burn
suggested
that
wiley
was
not
authority
for
imposing
successorship
by
ability
for
unfair
labor
practices,
but
that
it
was
confined
to
this
question
of
an
assumption
of
contractual
obligations
which
is
the
court
in
mailey
said
were
essentially
consensual
in
origin.
to
the
other
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
white
concerning
a
common
law
--
state
law
regarding
the
obligations
of
a
successor.
we
have
cited
two
cases
in
our
brief,
we
have
not
quoted
extensively
from
them.
they're
on
page
37
of
our
opening
brief
schwartz
against
mcgraw-edison,
and
kloberdanz
against
joy.
but
i'd
like
if
i
may
to
quote
from
those
cases
as
we
did
in
our
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
mcgraw
case,
which
was
a
california
case,
there
was
this
language
"we
find
that
the
criteria
again
are
very
similar
to
those
outlined
by
the
court
in
regal
knitwear."
as
a
general
rule
where
a
corporation
sells
or
otherwise
transfers
all
its
assets,
its
transferee
is
not
liable
for
the
debts
and
liabilities
of
the
transferor.
and
that
liability
of
a
new
corporation
for
the
debts
of
another
corporation
does
not
result
from
the
mere
fact
the
former's
organize
to
succeed
the
latter.
it
is
generally
held
that
if
one
corporation
purchases
the
assets
of
another
and
pays
a
fair
consideration,
therefore,
no
liability
for
the
debts
of
the
selling
corporation
exists
in
the
absence
of
fraud,
or
agreement
to
assume
the
debts.
there
are
certain
instances
however,
in
which
the
purchaser
or
transferee
may
become
liable
and
then
they
go
on
to
specify
a
few
of
these
where
there
is
an
expressed
or
implied
agreement
of
assumption.
but
the
transaction
amounts
to
a
consolidation
or
merger,
but
the
transaction
was
fraudulent
where
some
elements
of
the
purchase
of
good
faith
were
lacking.
mr.
morton
jackson
we
do
indeed,
yes.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes
of
about
or
otherwise
-—
mr.
morton
jackson
i
believe
there
was.
i
believe
that
law
was
complied
with.
it's
presumed
fraudulent
otherwise.
mr.
morton
jackson
exactly.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
so
to
speak
--
to
assert
their
claims,
or
assert
any
liens
if
they
have
them.
mr.
morton
jackson
surely.
mr.
morton
jackson
exactly,
and
-—
mr.
morton
jackson
in
the
succeeding
paragraphs,
he
points
out
and
this
is
the
limit
of
language
that
both
of
these
situations
are
those
in
which
the
relationship
is
one,
which
might
have
itself,
established
liability,
and
i
think
this
is
the
touchstone.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
morton
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly,
if
the
court
please
to
the
general
approach
taken
by
the
board,
arguing
in
support
of
its
point
of
view
with
respect
to
the
two
specific
limitations
on
its
power.
i'm
speaking
of
the
limitation
contents
in
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
itself.
the
limitations
contained
in
rule
65
particularly
65
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
i
think
those
limitations
are
the
ones
that
the
board
has
attempted
to
dispense
with
in
reaching
the
result
that
it's
reached
in
this
case
on
a
successorship
issue
which
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
board
and
the
writers
tend
to
sweep
these
limitations
aside.
of
course
the
10
(c)
the
heart
of
that
again
is
that
states
that
the
board's
remedial
powers
must
be
exercised
only
against
those
who
have
actually
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practices
or
are
engaging
in
them.
and
the
language
of
section
65
(d)
which
had
such
penetrating
analysis
in
the
regal
knitwear
case
has
to
do
with
the
circumstances
under
which
a
successor
or
an
assigned
maybe
drawn
within
the
ambit
of
an
order
directed
to
a
wrong
doer.
now,
as
i
see
the
board
tends
to
shut
these
off
really
by
saying,
first
it
is
also
in
the
same
section
10
(c)
given
broad
remedial
powers
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
and
consider
them
in
light
of
this.
at
the
end,
it
has
in
mind
really
justifies
the
means
as
taken.
and
it
tends
to
treat
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
two
sections
i
just
mentioned
as
something
rather
technical
or
rather
arbitrary
and
arbitrary
but
technical
at
any
rate,
and
something
that
must
give
away
before
an
argument
addressed
to
considerations
of
substance
such
as
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
act.
in
answer
to
that,
i
would
say
it
first
and
i
think
again
this
is
fundamental.
that
both
of
these
sections
are
not
technical.
their
terms
and
body
provisions
are
of
fundamental
substance
and
they
articulate
fundamental
protections.
i
think
throughout
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
affording
a
party
hearing,
yes.
and
that
one
of
the
vices
inherent
in
what
the
board
has
done
is
to
deny
a
party
a
hearing,
but
even
more
fundamental
than
that
and
even
more
profound
a
vice
is
the
vice
which
lies
in
imposing
sanctions
for
illegal
conduct
for
wrong
doing
against
the
party
who
is
guiltless
of
any
wrong
doing
who
is
totally
innocent
of
any
wrongful
conduct.
this
is
what
we
are
getting
at.
so
these
are
not
just
technical
limitations,
they're
limitations
which
contain
the
expression,
the
embodiment
of
protections
of
considerable
substance
and
can't
simply
be
swept
aside.
this
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
think
not
your
honor.
it
certainly
was
--
sort
of
went
without
saying
in
the
regal
knitwear
case.
the
language
successors
and
the
signs
is
regularly
been
used
in
these
orders
and
that
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
this
is
true,
but
i
think
that
what
the
court
addressed
itself
to
in
the
regal
knitwear
case
was
the
fact
that
the
courts
are
going
to
be
called
upon
to
enforce
these
orders
and
what
justice
jackson
said
in
regal
knitwear
was
that
no
order
can
be
enforced,
no
order
which
contains
language
which
exceeds
the
limitations
of
rule
65
(d)
can
be
enforced
by
a
court.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
court's
enforcement
powers
are
limited,
quite
clearly
they
apply
to
the
labor
board
also.
however,
an
answer
to
each
of
these
considerations
if
each
on
its
merit
that
the
board
is
advanced
is
again
contained
in
this
very
remarkable
decision
in
the
regal
knitwear
case.
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
first
off
to
a
very
transient
statement
of
policy
made
by
the
court
in
the
southern
steamship
case,
where
it
says
it
is
sufficient
for
this
case,
this
court
speaking
again
on
this
and
justifying
the
means
argument.
it
is
sufficient
for
this
case
to
observe
that
the
board
has
not
been
commissioned
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
so
single-mindedly
that
it
may
ignore
the
equally
important
congressional
objectives.
justice
jackson
echoes
this
sentiment
when
he
says
in
regal
knitwear
that
this
language
about
broader
media
powers
in
order
to
effectuate
policies
of
the
act
containing
its
own
limitation.
he
points
out
in
the
following
language
that
these
powers
must
be
exercised
within
the
limits
of
the
authority
bestowed
by
the
statute.
administrative
agencies
have
considerable
latitude
to
shape
their
remedies
within
the
scope
of
their
statutory
authority.
and
then
it
goes
on
the
say
the
courts
may
not
grant
in
the
celebrated
language
an
enforcement
order
or
an
injunction
so
broad
as
to
make
punishable,
a
conduct
the
persons
who
act
independently
and
whose
rights
have
not
been
adjudged
according
to
law.
now,
again
it
is
suggested
that
by
the
writers
and
notably
professor
goldberg
and
the
north
western
law
review
who
was
cited
by
board
and
its
brief
at
page
21
and
indeed
whose
views
find
reflections
throughout
on
the
board's
brief
that
regal
knitwear
doesn't
really
mean
what
it
says,
and
in
any
event
it
has
left
the
door
open
by
language
in
giving
two
examples.
the
court
gives
two
examples,
it
suggests
for
example
the
successive
concept
could
apply
in
a
situation
where
the
successor
was
merely
a
disguised
continuance
of
the
predecessor,
and
therefore
has
a
substantial
identity
with
him
or
where
the
succession
itself,
the
transfer
has
been
utilized
simply
as
a
means
of
evading
or
avoiding
trust
to
the
force
of
the
order.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct.
the
successor
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
and
that
is
not
disputed
as
far
as
the
predecessor
is
concerned.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
--
mr.
morton
jackson
we
do
not
dispute
that
personal
method
of
computation
has
been
disputed.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
assumed
specified
obligations
only.
there
were
certain
specified
obligations
set
out
in
the
sale
agreement
and
it
assumed
only
though
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
customary.
this
was
an
asset
purchase
your
honor.
it
was
not
a
merger,
not
a
statutory
merger
such
as
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
certain
specified
obligations
only.
the
successor
did
all
american
and
these
were
specifically
enumerated,
this
particular
item
was
not
one
of
them.
the
predecessor
--
mr.
morton
jackson
no,
i
think
under
the
cases
we've
cited
that
for
this
particular
type
of
obligation
the
reverse
would
be
truly
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
morton
jackson
under
state
law,
yes.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct.
even
--
mr.
morton
jackson
we've
cited
one
case
in
our
brief
is
--
mr.
morton
jackson
not
the
seller,
not
the
seller.
i
beg
our
pardon
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
the
seller
certainly
cannot
avoid.
mr.
morton
jackson
not
if
a
lien
has
not
been
established
against
those
assets
prior
to
the
time
they
conveyed.
mr.
morton
jackson
if
it's
a
fraudulent
conveyance
--
if
the
conveyance
is
made
with
the
intent
of
defrauding
creditors
your
honor,
i
think
indeed
and
the
purchaser
is
not
an
innocent
purchaser
and
is
a
party
that,
i
think
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
and
we
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
the
predecessor
had
other
business
interests.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
--
did
not
go
out
of
business,
it
had
other
interest
they
were
not
in
the
soft
drink
field.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
did
not
include
an
agreement
indemnify
as
such
your
honor.
it
includes,
mr.
chief
justice
the
customary
warranty
against
the
pending
litigation
and
against
all
litigation
except
that
specifically
disclosed
to
the
purchaser.
as
the
record
discloses,
in
this
case
the
pendency
of
this
litigation
had
slipped
everybody’s
mind,
and
was
not
specified
in
the
agreement.
so
it's
pendency
and
the
liability
attaching,
would
ordinarily
constitute
a
breach
of
that
warrant,
a
giving
rise
to
--
mr.
morton
jackson
well,
as
between
the
parties,
any
liability
that
was
imposed
against
all
american
would
be
the
subject
of
indemnification
by
golden
state
to
the
extent
that
all
american
was
held
liable,
yes.
i
believe
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
morton
jackson
i
should
say
it
was
contractual
and
that
it
stands
from
the
breach
of
that
warranty.
thus,
if
all
americans
suffered
financial
loss
of
any
kind
as
a
consequence
of
the
existence
of
litigation
which
had
been
warranted
not
to
exist,
i
take
it
that
the
golden
state
bottling
co.
would
have
to
indemnify
for
it,
or
against
that
loss.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
you
honor,
in
the
course
--
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
post
burns
in
the
court
of
appeals
after
the
briefs
were
filed,
i
believe
--
the
burns
case
was
i
believe
was
dealt
with
in
the
briefs
and
it
was
a
subject
--
with
the
court.
mr.
morton
jackson
i
did
not
myself
read
burns
as
having
a
bearing
on
the
successor’s
obligation
to
hire
a
predecessor’s
employees
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
point
was
not
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
think
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
i
don't
read
burns
is
changing
that
the
successor
is
under
no
obligation
other
things
being
equal
to
hire
any
other's
predecessors
employees
that
if
i
may
cite
a
case
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
believe
so,
and
there
is
the
tri-state
maintenance
case
which
rejected
a
counter
suggestion
by
the
board
and
the
board
has
since
taken
that
view
that
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
successor
other
things
being
equal
to
hire
any
of
the
employees
of
the
predecessor.
i
believe
mr.
come
will
concur
with
that
view,
and
i'd
be
happy
to
cite
for
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
yes.
mr.
morton
jackson
no,
i
believe
not.
mr.
morton
jackson
because
the
unfair
practice
remained
un-remedied
in
this
respect.
and
because
the
successor
is
the
only
party
capable
of
fulfilling
the
remedy
in
this
aspect,
then
it
must
be
against
this
party
that
this
aspect
to
the
remedy
is
invoked.
the
board
does
not
consider
and
this
of
course
goes
only
to
the
reinstatement
aspect
of
it.
this
argument
of
course
does
not
pertain
to
the
financial
aspect
of
it,
the
back
pay
aspect
of
it.
at
least
certainly
not
as
to
that
portion
of
it
that
accrued
up
to
the
time
of
sale.
there
is
again
a
question
as
to
whether
the
successor
should
be
liable
for
all
of
the
back
pay
liability
even
before
the
time
of
sale.
this
is
not
the
right
way
of
looking
at
it.
have
i
answered
your
honor's
question?
mr.
morton
jackson
well,
this
again
it
has
to
do
with
the
obligation
of
bargain
and
i
think
the
two
can't
be
--
mr.
morton
jackson
well
this
is
true.
at
burns
--
mr.
morton
jackson
yes
indeed,
but
then
again
would
be
a
matter
of
contract
your
honor
which
does
not
bear
upon
the
present
case.
now,
burns
was
considered
as
having
some
bearing
in
this
case
since
it
threw
light
upon
the
significance
of
the
wiley
against
livingston
decision
on
which
the
board
in
turn
based
its
change
of
course
in
perma
vinyl.
and
burns
was
read
by
judge
kilkenny
who
dissented
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
narrowing
the
scope
of
wiley
in
its
application
to
this
type
of
case,
and
in
fact
excluding
its
application
to
cases
involving
liability
for
unfair
practices
as
distinct
from
the
succession
to
the
obligation
of
bargain,
or
the
obligation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
resulted
from
a
bargaining
arrangement
of
the
predecessor.
to
return
to
the
point
i
was
making
the
argument
of
justice
jackson
or
the
language
of
justice
jackson.
he
touched
down,
i
think
is
found
as
i
say,
professor
goldberg
suggests
that
there
is
an
open
door
which
leaves
it
wide
open
for
other
situations
including
the
one
before
us
that
of
an
innocent
successor.
but
we
suggest
that
is
foreclosed
by
the
language
of
the
succeeding
paragraph
in
which
he
points
out
the
common
aspect
to
both
of
these
examples
he
is
given.
he
says
"in
both
of
these
cases,
the
reference
is
not
merely
to
succession,
but
to
a
relation
between
the
defendant
and
the
successor
which
might
of
itself
establish
liability
within
the
terms
of
rule
65."
we
suggest
we
urge
to
the
court
that
that
says
plainly
as
anything
could
that
an
innocent
successor
as
against
to
him,
there
is
no
independent
basis
for
assessing
liability
who's
guilty
of
no
wrong.
who
is
not
in
the
league
with
the
predecessor
or
assisting
him
to
evade
the
order
or
conspiring
with
him
in
a
collusive
manner
to
carry
out
this
type
of
conduct.
the
term
successor
on
a
sign
cannot
reach
out
and
bind
such
a
person,
because
to
do
so
would
be
offensive
to
due
process,
and
to
exceed
the
scope
of
that
section.
we
urge
therefore
that
these
limitations
are
limitations
of
substance
and
cannot
be
swept
aside
or
cannot
be
ignored
in
view
of
the
other
limited
considerations
which
the
board
has
advanced.
and
may
suggest
that
to
do
so,
amounts
really
to
an
exultation
not
merely
a
form,
but
of
doctrine,
at
the
sacrifice
of
fundamental
law
and
of
substantive
right.
if
i
may
briefly
address
myself
to
1
or
2
of
the
practical
or
what
we
called
in
our
brief,
the
policy
considerations
--
by
the
board.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
if
i
may
that
the
enforcement
of
the
reinstatement
remedy
whether
it's
against
a
original
employer,
this
is
a
well
settled
remedy
and
one
with
which
we
have
no
quarrel.
but
in
any
event,
and
particularly
against
a
successor
who
as
we
see
has
other
than
being
no
obligation
whatever
to
hire
any
of
his
predecessor's
employers.
it
does
work
a
hardship
on
the
innocent
employee
who
has
to
be
displaced
to
make
way
for
the
rehired
discriminatee.
the
argument
is
frequently
seen
only
from
the
stand
point
of
the
discriminatee
who
is
out
of
a
job,
who
wants
to
be
reinstated,
and
who
is
now
remedied
less
because
the
business
has
changed
counts.
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
order
to
accommodate
even
a
respect,
somebody
else
is
going
to
have
to
be
laid
off.
also
the
argument
that
a
successor
can
hire
and
that
will
work
no
hardship,
and
then
if
he
proves
to
be
a
non-satisfactory
employee,
may
fire
him
for
cause.
in
such
circumstances
where
the
board
tends
to
try
as
it's
indicated
in
this
case
must
frequently
attempted
to
establish
as
board
policy,
a
presumption
that
the
successor
is
going
to
continue
the
unfair
practices
of
the
predecessor.
and
given
the
burden
which
the
employer
has
under
this
court's
great
dane
case
to
in
effect
establish
that
this
discriminatory
reason
was
not
the
reason
for
the
discharge.
i
think
this
is
not
a
realistic
argument,
because
with
the
tract
record
such
as
this,
which
is
going
to
be
raised
against
him,
a
successes
is
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
time
discharging
for
cause
and
making
it
stand
up
against
an
8
(a)
(3)
charge
a
purely
practical
matter.
this
is
the
way
it
works.
also,
by
insisting
on
this
type
of
remedial
action,
we
should
like
to
suggest
again
that
a
practical
result
if
this
were
to
become
settled
policy.
that
successors
would
in
examining
this,
to
the
extent
that
they
were
aware
of
it,
would
be
more
inclined
to
other
things
being
equal
to
hire
none
of
the
predecessor's
employees,
and
instead
of
promoting
stability,
he
is
likely
to
promote
just
the
opposite
result
in
order
to
avoid
being
classified
as
a
successor,
or
in
order
to
avoid
being
projected
in
to
this
uncertain
and
potentially
expensive
situation.
i
think
to
most
of
the
further
questions,
i
would
conclude
with
that
to
open
end,
if
the
court
please,
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
reply.
mr.
morton
jackson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
like
to
correct
a
misstatement
of
the
fact.
quite
unintentional
i'm
sure
on
the
part
of
mr.
come.
there
was
another
union
here,
the
issue
one
of
the
issues
in
the
original
unfair
practice
case
is
the
question
of
domination
of
that
union
which
has
resolved.
mr.
morton
jackson
and
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
was
no
issue
as
to
the
obligation
of
the
successor
to
abide
by
it,
the
successor
of
the
organization
did.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes
we
did.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
not
one
of
the
specific
obligations
assumed
as
i
recall.
i'm
--
mr.
morton
jackson
it
just
simply
assumed
the
obligations
under
the
old
one.
mr.
morton
jackson
and
continued
right
on
with
the
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
don't
honestly
recall
your
honor
exactly
what
it
did
provide
in
this
respect.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
so
it
--
mr.
morton
jackson
well,
i
mean
it
was
not
major
issue
below.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
it
cannot
be
an
issue
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
believe
not.
mr.
morton
jackson
because
i
believe
that
the
assumption
of
the
agreement
was
not
a
matter
of
the
sale
contract,
it
was
a
voluntary
assumption
by
the
successor
after
having
taken
over,
but
i
think
--
mr.
morton
jackson
i
think
that's
undoubtedly
true.
after
those
obligations
attached
and
after
we
would
assume
them
without
question
if
the
–-
mr.
morton
jackson
if
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
workforce
and
we
had
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
we
had
assumed
attempted
to
discharge
him
without
cause,
it
would've
given
rise
to
a
cause
of
grievance
under
the
contract
without
question.
mr.
morton
jackson
he
was
indeed.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
jackson
it
was
an
independent
union,
yes.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
and
the
original
case,
which
largely
disposed
off
those
domination
charges.
the
origin
--
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct
your
honor
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
original
case.
the
discharge
was
an
issue
in
that,
but
it
was
not
one
of
the
principal
issues.
mr.
morton
jackson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
i
believe
not.
mr.
morton
jackson
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
if
i
may,
in
the
time
remaining
to
address
myself
to
the
two
questions
posed
by
mr.
justice
white.
first,
the
question
of
the
significance
of
the
burn’s
case
in
this
case,
and
judge
wiley,
or
judge
kilkenny's
reliance
upon
it.
we
have
prefaces
by
recalling
that
the
board’s
original
position
was
premised
on
wiley,
or
in
the
regal
knitwear
and
the
symns
grocer
decision
of
the
board
was
premised
on
regal
knitwear
and
the
birdsall-stockdale
cases
that
came
as
a
consequence
of
it.
the
change
of
position
in
perma
vinyl
in
the
board's
rationale
did
not
deal
with
these
cases
but
went
instead
to
the
language
of
wiley
to
support
its
change
of
course.
burns
contained
language
which
suggested
that
wiley
did
not
support
that
view,
in
this
language.
we
do
not
find
wiley
controlling
in
the
circumstances
here.
wiley
arouse
in
the
context
of
the
section
301
suit
to
compel
arbitration,
not
in
the
context
of
an
unfair
practice
proceeding
where
the
board
is
expressly
limited
by
the
provisions
of
section
8
(d)
the
decision
emphasized
the
preference
of
national
labor
policy
for
arbitration
as
a
substitute
for
a
test
of
strength
and
so
forth.
but
that
language
in
burn
suggested
that
wiley
was
not
authority
for
imposing
successorship
by
ability
for
unfair
labor
practices,
but
that
it
was
confined
to
this
question
of
an
assumption
of
contractual
obligations
which
is
the
court
in
mailey
said
were
essentially
consensual
in
origin.
to
the
other
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
white
concerning
a
common
law
--
state
law
regarding
the
obligations
of
a
successor.
we
have
cited
two
cases
in
our
brief,
we
have
not
quoted
extensively
from
them.
they're
on
page
37
of
our
opening
brief
schwartz
against
mcgraw-edison,
and
kloberdanz
against
joy.
but
i'd
like
if
i
may
to
quote
from
those
cases
as
we
did
in
our
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
mcgraw
case,
which
was
a
california
case,
there
was
this
language
"we
find
that
the
criteria
again
are
very
similar
to
those
outlined
by
the
court
in
regal
knitwear."
as
a
general
rule
where
a
corporation
sells
or
otherwise
transfers
all
its
assets,
its
transferee
is
not
liable
for
the
debts
and
liabilities
of
the
transferor.
and
that
liability
of
a
new
corporation
for
the
debts
of
another
corporation
does
not
result
from
the
mere
fact
the
former's
organize
to
succeed
the
latter.
it
is
generally
held
that
if
one
corporation
purchases
the
assets
of
another
and
pays
a
fair
consideration,
therefore,
no
liability
for
the
debts
of
the
selling
corporation
exists
in
the
absence
of
fraud,
or
agreement
to
assume
the
debts.
there
are
certain
instances
however,
in
which
the
purchaser
or
transferee
may
become
liable
and
then
they
go
on
to
specify
a
few
of
these
where
there
is
an
expressed
or
implied
agreement
of
assumption.
but
the
transaction
amounts
to
a
consolidation
or
merger,
but
the
transaction
was
fraudulent
where
some
elements
of
the
purchase
of
good
faith
were
lacking.
mr.
morton
jackson
we
do
indeed,
yes.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes
of
about
or
otherwise
-—
mr.
morton
jackson
i
believe
there
was.
i
believe
that
law
was
complied
with.
it's
presumed
fraudulent
otherwise.
mr.
morton
jackson
exactly.
mr.
morton
jackson
yes,
so
to
speak
--
to
assert
their
claims,
or
assert
any
liens
if
they
have
them.
mr.
morton
jackson
surely.
mr.
morton
jackson
exactly,
and
-—
mr.
morton
jackson
in
the
succeeding
paragraphs,
he
points
out
and
this
is
the
limit
of
language
that
both
of
these
situations
are
those
in
which
the
relationship
is
one,
which
might
have
itself,
established
liability,
and
i
think
this
is
the
touchstone.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
