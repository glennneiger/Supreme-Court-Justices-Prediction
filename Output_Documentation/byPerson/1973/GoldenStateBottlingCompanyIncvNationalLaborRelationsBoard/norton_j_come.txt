mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
here
is
whether
the
board
may
properly
require
one
who
acquires
through
a
bona
fide
sale,
a
business
and
continues
it
in
substantially
unchanged
form
using
the
same
workforce.
to
reinstate
with
back
pay
an
employee
whom
the
predecessor
employer
has
discharged
in
violation
of
the
act.
where
at
the
time
of
the
sale,
the
successor
employer
has
knowledge
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
of
the
predecessor's
failure
to
remedy
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
an
issue
that
is
up.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
would
agree
that
both
of
those
issues
are
here
and
i'll
try
to
answer
them.
it
is
undisputed
that
all
american
acquired
through
a
bona
fide
a
sale,
the
plant,
the
machinery,
the
accounts
receivable,
the
trade
name,
and
other
assets
of
the
golden
state
bottling
operation
that
is
retained
virtually
all
of
golden
state's
employees.
including
the
12
distributors
and
all
of
golden
state's
supervisory
and
managerial
employees.
including
the
general
manager,
eugene
schilling
who
is
the
one
who
discharged
the
employee
in
question
when
he
was
general
manager
for
golden
state.
and
it's
further
undisputed
that
all
american
continued
to
manufacture
the
same
products,
the
same
location,
the
same
plant,
and
distribute
them
to
the
same
customers.
i
think
we're
all
agreed
on
that.
thus,
all
american
would
be
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
act
not
only
under
the
test
of
the
majority
of
the
court
in
burns,
but
also
under
the
more
stringent
test
of
the
dissenting
justices
in
burns,
which
requires
that
the
new
employer
not
only
take
over
the
same
employee
complement,
but
he
also
succeed
to
some
the
tangible
or
intangible
assets
of
the
predecessor
company.
we
have
got
that
here.
now,
petitioners
deny
that
all
american
had
knowledge
at
the
time
of
the
sale
of
golden
state's
un-remedied,
unfair
labor
practices.
the
board
found
that
the
contrary
in
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
that
finding
and
normally
under
universal
camera
that
issue
would
not
be
open.
however,
it
was
raised
as
a
question
in
the
petition
and
the
grant
of
certiorari
does
not
exclude
it.
so
therefore,
that
issue
is
up
here.
now,
with
respect
to
that,
we
submit
that
there
is
adequate
evidentiary
support
for
the
board's
finding
that
all
american
had
knowledge.
as
i
indicated
before
all
american
retained
a
general
manager
of
the
bottling
operation,
eugene
schilling
who
had
committed
the
unfair
labor
practice
in
question.
schilling
participated
in
one
of
the
sale
negotiating
sessions
with
all
american,
at
which
among
other
things
his
retention
as
general
manager
was
discussed.
shortly
thereafter
with
still
before
the
sale
was
concluded,
he
met
in
the
plant
with
a
representative
of
all
american
and
discussed
general
operations
and
“future
plans”.
he
also
signed
the
sales
agreement
of
january
31,
1968
which
agreement
specifically
provided
for
his
retention
as
general
manager.
in
these
circumstances
we
submit
that
the
board
could
reasonably
infer
as
it
did.
that
schilling
had
conveyed
his
knowledge
of
the
pending
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
to
all
american
at
or
before
the
consummation
of
the
sale,
or
at
a
very
least
that
schilling’s
knowledge
thereof
could
properly
be
imputed
to
all
americans.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
submit
that
it
is
not.
here,
you
had
a
man
who
was
intimately
involved
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
that
was
not
only
needed
to
just
come
on
board
after
the
sale
was
consummated.
he
was
in
negotiations
with
all
americans
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
as
of
the
time
that
he
became
an
employee
of
all
american,
it
could
be
imputed
all
american
and
that
took
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
have
some
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
that
i
have
to
rest
on
that
position
but
i
think
that
it's
reasonable
to
infer
knowledge
from
the
circumstances.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
in
view
of
schilling’s
contact
with
all
american
officials
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
sale.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did
your
honor.
furthermore,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
although
golden
state
president
crofoot
and
schilling
testified
that
they
did
not
tell
all
american
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
sale.
the
trial
examiner
discredited
these
denials
and
i
submit
that
there
was
ample
basis
for
his
action
in
doing
so
in
view
of
the
fact
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases
where
you
have
direct
evidence.
i
think
which
--
it's
a
situation
which
you
have
very
often
in
many
cases
particularly
labor
board
cases
where
you
have
to
draw
inferences
from
the
total
circumstances.
and
one
of
these
circumstances
in
addition
to
the
previous
one
that
i
had
outlined,
is
the
fact
that
the
denials
were
discredited
by
the
trial
examiner
for
the
reason
that
he
found
that
not
only
had
crofoot
and
schilling
contradicted
themselves
in
their
testimony
before
him,
but
there
were
a
series
of
documents
that
they
had
signed
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
which
either
concealed
or
failed
to
disclose
the
sale
of
all
american,
to
both
the
board
and
to
the
court
of
appeals.
thus,
in
november
1968,
more
than
six
months
after
the
sale
and
his
authority
to
act
for
golden
state
had
entered,
schilling
executed
a
letter
and
substitution
of
counsel
in
the
court
below
as
general
kyle,
manager
of
golden
state
bottling
company.
on
december
11,
1968
as
president
of
golden
state,
he
signed
a
notice
to
employees
required
by
the
board’s
order
and
sent
the
board
a
certification
to
that
effect
in
the
same
day.
on
behalf
of
golden
state
he
offered
baker
the
wrongfully
discharged
employee
reinstatement
as
a
driver
salesman
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
almost
a
year
ago
or
previous
his
authority
to
act
in
behalf
of
golden
state
had
ended.
and
on
november
24th
1969
more
than
21
months
after
the
sale,
crofoot
as
president
of
golden
state
verified
under
penalty
of
perjury,
the
answer
to
the
board's
original
back
pay
specification.
and
that
answer
made
no
mention
of
the
sale.
alleged
that
golden
state
had
offered
baker
reinstatement
on
december
11th
more
than
10
months
after
he'd
gone
out
of
the
bottling
business.
on
the
basis
of
all
of
these
factors,
we
submit
that
the
trial
examiner
was
warranted
in
discrediting
the
denials
of
crofoot
and
schilling
that
they
did
not
tell.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
submit
that
we
sustained
the
burden
of
proof
by
schillling's
contact
with
officials
of
all
american
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
sale
which
warranted
the
inference
that
he
conveyed
his
knowledge
to
them.
further
factor
here
is
that
the
officials
of
all
american
were
not
called
to
testify
although
certainly
golden
state
and
its
attorneys
could
have
done
so.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
thought
that
we
had
had
sustained
it
by
the
circumstances.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
believe
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
that
testimonial
evidence
was
discredited
and
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
disbelieved
and
we
felt
that
the
circumstances
were
sufficient
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
maybe
if
we
were
trying
the
case
today
we
might
have
done
differently.
but
this
is
the
state
of
the
record
and
it
did
pass
muster
in
the
court
of
appeals.
of
course
if
we
lose
on
that
issue
then
we
don't
need
to
reach
the
further
question
that
i
now
want
to
get
to.
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
board's
legal
position
that
a
successor
employer
with
knowledge
can
be
required
to
remedy
the
predecessor’s
unfair
labor
practice.
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
authorizes
the
board
the
issue
of
remedial
the
orders
against
any
person
named
in
the
complaint
who
was
engaged
in
any
unfair
labor
practice.
however,
from
the
beginning,
board
orders
have
covered
not
only
the
person
found
of
committed
the
unfair
labor
practice,
but
its
officers,
agents,
successors,
and
assigns.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
those
orders
could
be
applied
not
only
to
one
who
is
merely
a
diguised
continuance
of
the
old
employer,
but
also
inappropriate
circumstances,
and
i'm
reading
from
regal
knitwear.”
to
those
to
whom
the
business
may
have
been
transferred,
whether
as
a
means
of
evading
the
judgment,
or
for
other
reasons”.
now
the
question
whether
a
successor
was
in
the
meeting
of
the
board’s
order,
they
properly
include
not
only
an
alter
ego,
or
an
aider,
or
a
better
of
the
old
employer,
but
also
a
bona
fide
purchaser
where
it
continues
the
employing
entity
which
was
the
locus
of
the
unfair
labor
practices,
and
it
acquires
that
entity
with
knowledge
that
the
predecessor
has
failed
to
remedy
those
unfair
labor
practices,
turns
on
an
appraisal
or
the
policies
of
the
act
and
also
of
rule
65
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
now
as
to
the
policy
to
the
act,
in
burns,
this
court
held
that
the
policies
of
the
act
were
effectuated
by
imposing
on
a
wholly
independent
new
employer.
the
old
employer’s
bargaining
obligation
where
he
was
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
act
and
we
have
that
here
even
under
the
centers
of
more
stringent
test.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
contract
here.
there
wasn't
any
union
in
the
picture.
baker
was
discharged
because
he
was
spearheading
an
organizational
drive
and
union
never
got
into
this
plant.
so
we
don't
have
any
question
of
continuity
of
a
bargaining
relationship
or
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
the
dissenting
judge
misconceived
the
effects
of
burns.
i
think
that
if
anything
burns
furnishes
support
for
the
board's
position
here
because
it
does
recognize
that
the
concept
of
successor
employer
has
validity
for
purposes
of
the
national
relations
act
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
recognized
that
insofar
as
it
held
that
an
independent
new
employer
who
merely
went
as
far
as
continuing
the
same
bargaining
unit
and
taking
over
a
majority
of
the
predecessor’s
workforce,
had
a
bargaining
--
had
succeeded
to
the
predecessor's
bargaining
obligation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
know
that
the
dissenter
is
in
burns'
point
out
that
the
majority
does
not
use
the
word
successor.
however,
in
the
latter
part
of
the
majority
opinion
in
burns,
when
we
come
to
the
discussion
of
the
unilateral
action,
the
word
successor
employer
is
used
quite
frequently.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
but
there
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
see
that
burns
would
effect
the
board’s
application
of
this
case,
the
principles
of
the
board
applied
in
this
case.
the
only
part
of
burns
that
could
be
deemed
to
have
a
bearing
on
this
case
is
that
the
board
relied
very
heavily
on
the
wiley
against
livingston
decision.
that
is
the
policy
reflected
in
wiley
against
livingston
for
holding
that
the
new
employer
could
be
bound
to
the
contract.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
but
since
we
don't
have
any
effort
here
to
bind
the
new
employer
to
the
predecessor's
collective
bargaining
agreement
since
there
was
none.
you
do
not
have
in
the
board's
policy
of
requiring
the
successor,
the
remedy,
the
unfair
labor
practices.
any
collision
with
the
freedom
of
contract
policy
reflected
in
8
(d)of
the
statute.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
needn't
have
kept
him
on
if
he
had
good
cause
for
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct.
i
mean
he
needn't
have
kept
him
on,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
he
could
not
have
fired
him
for
a
union
reason,
because
he
would
have
committed
a
new
unfair
labor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
however,
if
you
get
somebody
fired
the
day
after
he's
put
on.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
i
do.
but
the
point
is
that
the
successor
here
took
over
not
only
the
assets,
but
he
took
over
the
whole
workforce.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
because
there
is
an
unremedied,
unfair
labor
practice
here
that
the
successor
is
the
only
person
that
can
only
fully
remedy
as
long
as
he
is
continuing
the
same
employee
enterprise.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
employee
enterprise,
i
think
is
fairly
easy
to
describe
here,
because
what
he
has
done
is,
he
is
continuing
exactly
the
same
business
that
the
golden
state
had.
the
same
plant,
the
same
equipment,
the
same
assets
and
in
addition
to
that
it
is
taken
over
the
entire
workforce
including
the
managerial
force.
so
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
has
been
a
word
of
art
that
i
guess
goes
back
to
the
old
sixth
circuit
case,
nlrb
against
colten.
but
it's
synonymous
with
when
you
have
a
new
employer
who
has
identified
himself
with
the
predecessor
to
a
sufficient
extent
to
be
considered
a
successor
for
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
and
if
he
continues
enough
of
it
to
become
a
successor
for
purpose
of
the
act,
he
has
carried
on
the
employing
enterprise.
but
i
don't
want
to
get
bogged
down
in
the
semantics
of
it,
because
i
think
that
under
any
standard
in
this
case
at
least.
if
you
are
ever
going
to
find
a
continuation
of
the
enterprise
or
a
successor
for
purposes
of
the
act
you
have
it
here.
now,
in
terms
of
the
hardship
on
the
successor,
if
you
apply
the
board's
principle
that
he
has
to
have
knowledge,
and
whether
you
have
it
here
of
course
is
another
question.
he
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
this
was
a
dischargee
who
was
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
too.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
answer
to
that
one
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
he
--
we're
assuming
a
situation
where
there
has
been
no
discharge
at
all.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
think
that
that
would
probably
be
alright.
that
is
not
this
case.
now
with
respect
to
the
successor
as
i
started
to
say
that
if
he
is
required
to
have
knowledge
of
the
unfair
labor
practice,
he
can
protect
himself
by
either
negotiating
an
allowance
in
the
sales
price
to
cover
his
liability,
or
an
indemnity
agreement
as
was
true
here.
it's
not
only
an
indemnity
that
flows
from
the
sales
agreement,
but
also
at
the
board
hearing.
the
president
of
golden
state
orally
agreed
to
indemnify
all
american
for
any
backpay
liability
that
might
be
imposed
upon
it.
before
sitting
down,
i
want
to
address
myself
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
when
i
say
that
he
need
not
take
him
on,
i
have
been
assuming
a
situation
where
there
is
no
un-remedied
unfair
labor
practice.
if
there
is
an
un-remedied
unfair
labor
practice
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
want
to
address
myself
to
regal
knitwear
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
have
i
answered
your
question
or
have
i
confused
you?
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
yes
it
is.
i
think
i've
appeared
to
give
inconsistent
answer,
because
at
one
time,
i
was
assuming
we
were
dealing
with
an
employee
who
was
not
the
victim
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
at
other
times,
i've
been
switching
to
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
but
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
about
regal
knitwear.
regal
knitwear
says,
and
although
the
court
was
not
really
addressing
itself
to
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
in
regal
knitwear,
the
court
had
a
very
academic
question
to
decide.
namely,
whether
the
term
successors,
and
assigns,
and
the
board
order
should
just
be
stricken.
and
in
the
course
of
answering
that
question,
the
court
said
"well,
we
will
leave
it
in
there
because
in
any
event
you
can't
breathe
more
life
into
in
rule
65
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
would
permit
you
to
do."
now
rule
65
(d)
says
that
an
injunctive
order
shall
be
binding
on
the
parties
of
the
action
and
persons
acting
in
concert,
and
participation
with
them.
mr.
norton
j.
come
would
receive
actual
notice.
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
however,
goes
on
to
add
that
rule
65
(d)
really
reflects
the
old
common
law
of
policy
that
an
injunction
can't
go
beyond
binding
the
parties
to
the
action,
and
those
persons
in
privity
or
legally
identified
with
them.
now,
and
furthermore
that
the
reason
that
you
have
that
limitation
is
that
you
don't
want
an
injunction
binding
someone
whose
rights
have
not
been
adjudicated
by
the
court.
now,
we
believe
that
the
board's
--
the
principle
the
board
is
applying
here
comports
with
the
basic
policies
underlying
65
(d)
in
that
that
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
act,
the
kind
of
employer
that
i
have
been
talking
about
at
least
the
one
in
this
case,
could
be
found
to
be
in
privity
or
legally
identified
with
the
original
party
of
this
action.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
referring
to
the
labor
policy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
why
i
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
show
and
i've
done
so
in
more
detail
in
our
brief
that
simply
as
a
matter
of
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
is
reasonable
and
proper
to
impose
on
a
successor
employer
the
obligation
to
remedy
the
predecessor’s
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
to
find
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
furthermore,
with
respect
to
that
part
of
regal
that
attempts
to
ensure
that
you
won't
hold
somebody
whose
rights
have
not
been
adjudicated,
the
board
does
not
hold
a
successor
until
the
successor
is
given
notice
of
its
intention
to
apply
the
order
to
it,
and
a
opportunity
at
a
hearing
to
show
that
it
is
not
a
successor.
that
it
did
not
take
with
knowledge
and
that
it
would
otherwise
be
inappropriate
to
apply
the
order
to
it.
that
opportunity
was
fully
afforded
all
american
here,
and
it
took
full
advantage
of
the
opportunity.
so
we
believe
that
if
we're
right
on
the
policies
underlying
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
65
(d)
would
afford
no
obstacle
to
holding
the
successor
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
he
might
however
have
the
opportunity
to
show
that
he
would
have
no
room
to
take
him
back
which
might
affect
whether
or
not
the
reinstatement
obligation
would
apply
to
him,
or
whether
he
would
merely
be
required
to
put
him
on
a
preferential
hiring
list
in
the
case
any
vacancies
open
up.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
here
is
whether
the
board
may
properly
require
one
who
acquires
through
a
bona
fide
sale,
a
business
and
continues
it
in
substantially
unchanged
form
using
the
same
workforce.
to
reinstate
with
back
pay
an
employee
whom
the
predecessor
employer
has
discharged
in
violation
of
the
act.
where
at
the
time
of
the
sale,
the
successor
employer
has
knowledge
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
of
the
predecessor's
failure
to
remedy
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
an
issue
that
is
up.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
would
agree
that
both
of
those
issues
are
here
and
i'll
try
to
answer
them.
it
is
undisputed
that
all
american
acquired
through
a
bona
fide
a
sale,
the
plant,
the
machinery,
the
accounts
receivable,
the
trade
name,
and
other
assets
of
the
golden
state
bottling
operation
that
is
retained
virtually
all
of
golden
state's
employees.
including
the
12
distributors
and
all
of
golden
state's
supervisory
and
managerial
employees.
including
the
general
manager,
eugene
schilling
who
is
the
one
who
discharged
the
employee
in
question
when
he
was
general
manager
for
golden
state.
and
it's
further
undisputed
that
all
american
continued
to
manufacture
the
same
products,
the
same
location,
the
same
plant,
and
distribute
them
to
the
same
customers.
i
think
we're
all
agreed
on
that.
thus,
all
american
would
be
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
act
not
only
under
the
test
of
the
majority
of
the
court
in
burns,
but
also
under
the
more
stringent
test
of
the
dissenting
justices
in
burns,
which
requires
that
the
new
employer
not
only
take
over
the
same
employee
complement,
but
he
also
succeed
to
some
the
tangible
or
intangible
assets
of
the
predecessor
company.
we
have
got
that
here.
now,
petitioners
deny
that
all
american
had
knowledge
at
the
time
of
the
sale
of
golden
state's
un-remedied,
unfair
labor
practices.
the
board
found
that
the
contrary
in
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
that
finding
and
normally
under
universal
camera
that
issue
would
not
be
open.
however,
it
was
raised
as
a
question
in
the
petition
and
the
grant
of
certiorari
does
not
exclude
it.
so
therefore,
that
issue
is
up
here.
now,
with
respect
to
that,
we
submit
that
there
is
adequate
evidentiary
support
for
the
board's
finding
that
all
american
had
knowledge.
as
i
indicated
before
all
american
retained
a
general
manager
of
the
bottling
operation,
eugene
schilling
who
had
committed
the
unfair
labor
practice
in
question.
schilling
participated
in
one
of
the
sale
negotiating
sessions
with
all
american,
at
which
among
other
things
his
retention
as
general
manager
was
discussed.
shortly
thereafter
with
still
before
the
sale
was
concluded,
he
met
in
the
plant
with
a
representative
of
all
american
and
discussed
general
operations
and
“future
plans”.
he
also
signed
the
sales
agreement
of
january
31,
1968
which
agreement
specifically
provided
for
his
retention
as
general
manager.
in
these
circumstances
we
submit
that
the
board
could
reasonably
infer
as
it
did.
that
schilling
had
conveyed
his
knowledge
of
the
pending
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
to
all
american
at
or
before
the
consummation
of
the
sale,
or
at
a
very
least
that
schilling’s
knowledge
thereof
could
properly
be
imputed
to
all
americans.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
submit
that
it
is
not.
here,
you
had
a
man
who
was
intimately
involved
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
that
was
not
only
needed
to
just
come
on
board
after
the
sale
was
consummated.
he
was
in
negotiations
with
all
americans
(voice
overlap)
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
as
of
the
time
that
he
became
an
employee
of
all
american,
it
could
be
imputed
all
american
and
that
took
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
have
some
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
that
i
have
to
rest
on
that
position
but
i
think
that
it's
reasonable
to
infer
knowledge
from
the
circumstances.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
in
view
of
schilling’s
contact
with
all
american
officials
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
sale.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did
your
honor.
furthermore,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
although
golden
state
president
crofoot
and
schilling
testified
that
they
did
not
tell
all
american
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
sale.
the
trial
examiner
discredited
these
denials
and
i
submit
that
there
was
ample
basis
for
his
action
in
doing
so
in
view
of
the
fact
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases
where
you
have
direct
evidence.
i
think
which
--
it's
a
situation
which
you
have
very
often
in
many
cases
particularly
labor
board
cases
where
you
have
to
draw
inferences
from
the
total
circumstances.
and
one
of
these
circumstances
in
addition
to
the
previous
one
that
i
had
outlined,
is
the
fact
that
the
denials
were
discredited
by
the
trial
examiner
for
the
reason
that
he
found
that
not
only
had
crofoot
and
schilling
contradicted
themselves
in
their
testimony
before
him,
but
there
were
a
series
of
documents
that
they
had
signed
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
which
either
concealed
or
failed
to
disclose
the
sale
of
all
american,
to
both
the
board
and
to
the
court
of
appeals.
thus,
in
november
1968,
more
than
six
months
after
the
sale
and
his
authority
to
act
for
golden
state
had
entered,
schilling
executed
a
letter
and
substitution
of
counsel
in
the
court
below
as
general
kyle,
manager
of
golden
state
bottling
company.
on
december
11,
1968
as
president
of
golden
state,
he
signed
a
notice
to
employees
required
by
the
board’s
order
and
sent
the
board
a
certification
to
that
effect
in
the
same
day.
on
behalf
of
golden
state
he
offered
baker
the
wrongfully
discharged
employee
reinstatement
as
a
driver
salesman
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
almost
a
year
ago
or
previous
his
authority
to
act
in
behalf
of
golden
state
had
ended.
and
on
november
24th
1969
more
than
21
months
after
the
sale,
crofoot
as
president
of
golden
state
verified
under
penalty
of
perjury,
the
answer
to
the
board's
original
back
pay
specification.
and
that
answer
made
no
mention
of
the
sale.
alleged
that
golden
state
had
offered
baker
reinstatement
on
december
11th
more
than
10
months
after
he'd
gone
out
of
the
bottling
business.
on
the
basis
of
all
of
these
factors,
we
submit
that
the
trial
examiner
was
warranted
in
discrediting
the
denials
of
crofoot
and
schilling
that
they
did
not
tell.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
submit
that
we
sustained
the
burden
of
proof
by
schillling's
contact
with
officials
of
all
american
prior
to
the
consummation
of
the
sale
which
warranted
the
inference
that
he
conveyed
his
knowledge
to
them.
further
factor
here
is
that
the
officials
of
all
american
were
not
called
to
testify
although
certainly
golden
state
and
its
attorneys
could
have
done
so.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
thought
that
we
had
had
sustained
it
by
the
circumstances.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
believe
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
that
testimonial
evidence
was
discredited
and
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
disbelieved
and
we
felt
that
the
circumstances
were
sufficient
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
maybe
if
we
were
trying
the
case
today
we
might
have
done
differently.
but
this
is
the
state
of
the
record
and
it
did
pass
muster
in
the
court
of
appeals.
of
course
if
we
lose
on
that
issue
then
we
don't
need
to
reach
the
further
question
that
i
now
want
to
get
to.
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
board's
legal
position
that
a
successor
employer
with
knowledge
can
be
required
to
remedy
the
predecessor’s
unfair
labor
practice.
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
authorizes
the
board
the
issue
of
remedial
the
orders
against
any
person
named
in
the
complaint
who
was
engaged
in
any
unfair
labor
practice.
however,
from
the
beginning,
board
orders
have
covered
not
only
the
person
found
of
committed
the
unfair
labor
practice,
but
its
officers,
agents,
successors,
and
assigns.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
those
orders
could
be
applied
not
only
to
one
who
is
merely
a
diguised
continuance
of
the
old
employer,
but
also
inappropriate
circumstances,
and
i'm
reading
from
regal
knitwear.”
to
those
to
whom
the
business
may
have
been
transferred,
whether
as
a
means
of
evading
the
judgment,
or
for
other
reasons”.
now
the
question
whether
a
successor
was
in
the
meeting
of
the
board’s
order,
they
properly
include
not
only
an
alter
ego,
or
an
aider,
or
a
better
of
the
old
employer,
but
also
a
bona
fide
purchaser
where
it
continues
the
employing
entity
which
was
the
locus
of
the
unfair
labor
practices,
and
it
acquires
that
entity
with
knowledge
that
the
predecessor
has
failed
to
remedy
those
unfair
labor
practices,
turns
on
an
appraisal
or
the
policies
of
the
act
and
also
of
rule
65
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
now
as
to
the
policy
to
the
act,
in
burns,
this
court
held
that
the
policies
of
the
act
were
effectuated
by
imposing
on
a
wholly
independent
new
employer.
the
old
employer’s
bargaining
obligation
where
he
was
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
act
and
we
have
that
here
even
under
the
centers
of
more
stringent
test.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
contract
here.
there
wasn't
any
union
in
the
picture.
baker
was
discharged
because
he
was
spearheading
an
organizational
drive
and
union
never
got
into
this
plant.
so
we
don't
have
any
question
of
continuity
of
a
bargaining
relationship
or
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
the
dissenting
judge
misconceived
the
effects
of
burns.
i
think
that
if
anything
burns
furnishes
support
for
the
board's
position
here
because
it
does
recognize
that
the
concept
of
successor
employer
has
validity
for
purposes
of
the
national
relations
act
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
recognized
that
insofar
as
it
held
that
an
independent
new
employer
who
merely
went
as
far
as
continuing
the
same
bargaining
unit
and
taking
over
a
majority
of
the
predecessor’s
workforce,
had
a
bargaining
--
had
succeeded
to
the
predecessor's
bargaining
obligation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
know
that
the
dissenter
is
in
burns'
point
out
that
the
majority
does
not
use
the
word
successor.
however,
in
the
latter
part
of
the
majority
opinion
in
burns,
when
we
come
to
the
discussion
of
the
unilateral
action,
the
word
successor
employer
is
used
quite
frequently.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
but
there
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
see
that
burns
would
effect
the
board’s
application
of
this
case,
the
principles
of
the
board
applied
in
this
case.
the
only
part
of
burns
that
could
be
deemed
to
have
a
bearing
on
this
case
is
that
the
board
relied
very
heavily
on
the
wiley
against
livingston
decision.
that
is
the
policy
reflected
in
wiley
against
livingston
for
holding
that
the
new
employer
could
be
bound
to
the
contract.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
but
since
we
don't
have
any
effort
here
to
bind
the
new
employer
to
the
predecessor's
collective
bargaining
agreement
since
there
was
none.
you
do
not
have
in
the
board's
policy
of
requiring
the
successor,
the
remedy,
the
unfair
labor
practices.
any
collision
with
the
freedom
of
contract
policy
reflected
in
8
(d)of
the
statute.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
needn't
have
kept
him
on
if
he
had
good
cause
for
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct.
i
mean
he
needn't
have
kept
him
on,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
he
could
not
have
fired
him
for
a
union
reason,
because
he
would
have
committed
a
new
unfair
labor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
however,
if
you
get
somebody
fired
the
day
after
he's
put
on.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
i
do.
but
the
point
is
that
the
successor
here
took
over
not
only
the
assets,
but
he
took
over
the
whole
workforce.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
because
there
is
an
unremedied,
unfair
labor
practice
here
that
the
successor
is
the
only
person
that
can
only
fully
remedy
as
long
as
he
is
continuing
the
same
employee
enterprise.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
employee
enterprise,
i
think
is
fairly
easy
to
describe
here,
because
what
he
has
done
is,
he
is
continuing
exactly
the
same
business
that
the
golden
state
had.
the
same
plant,
the
same
equipment,
the
same
assets
and
in
addition
to
that
it
is
taken
over
the
entire
workforce
including
the
managerial
force.
so
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
has
been
a
word
of
art
that
i
guess
goes
back
to
the
old
sixth
circuit
case,
nlrb
against
colten.
but
it's
synonymous
with
when
you
have
a
new
employer
who
has
identified
himself
with
the
predecessor
to
a
sufficient
extent
to
be
considered
a
successor
for
purposes
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
and
if
he
continues
enough
of
it
to
become
a
successor
for
purpose
of
the
act,
he
has
carried
on
the
employing
enterprise.
but
i
don't
want
to
get
bogged
down
in
the
semantics
of
it,
because
i
think
that
under
any
standard
in
this
case
at
least.
if
you
are
ever
going
to
find
a
continuation
of
the
enterprise
or
a
successor
for
purposes
of
the
act
you
have
it
here.
now,
in
terms
of
the
hardship
on
the
successor,
if
you
apply
the
board's
principle
that
he
has
to
have
knowledge,
and
whether
you
have
it
here
of
course
is
another
question.
he
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
this
was
a
dischargee
who
was
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
too.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
answer
to
that
one
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
he
--
we're
assuming
a
situation
where
there
has
been
no
discharge
at
all.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
think
that
that
would
probably
be
alright.
that
is
not
this
case.
now
with
respect
to
the
successor
as
i
started
to
say
that
if
he
is
required
to
have
knowledge
of
the
unfair
labor
practice,
he
can
protect
himself
by
either
negotiating
an
allowance
in
the
sales
price
to
cover
his
liability,
or
an
indemnity
agreement
as
was
true
here.
it's
not
only
an
indemnity
that
flows
from
the
sales
agreement,
but
also
at
the
board
hearing.
the
president
of
golden
state
orally
agreed
to
indemnify
all
american
for
any
backpay
liability
that
might
be
imposed
upon
it.
before
sitting
down,
i
want
to
address
myself
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
when
i
say
that
he
need
not
take
him
on,
i
have
been
assuming
a
situation
where
there
is
no
un-remedied
unfair
labor
practice.
if
there
is
an
un-remedied
unfair
labor
practice
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
want
to
address
myself
to
regal
knitwear
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
have
i
answered
your
question
or
have
i
confused
you?
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
yes
it
is.
i
think
i've
appeared
to
give
inconsistent
answer,
because
at
one
time,
i
was
assuming
we
were
dealing
with
an
employee
who
was
not
the
victim
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
at
other
times,
i've
been
switching
to
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
but
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
about
regal
knitwear.
regal
knitwear
says,
and
although
the
court
was
not
really
addressing
itself
to
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
in
regal
knitwear,
the
court
had
a
very
academic
question
to
decide.
namely,
whether
the
term
successors,
and
assigns,
and
the
board
order
should
just
be
stricken.
and
in
the
course
of
answering
that
question,
the
court
said
"well,
we
will
leave
it
in
there
because
in
any
event
you
can't
breathe
more
life
into
in
rule
65
(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
would
permit
you
to
do."
now
rule
65
(d)
says
that
an
injunctive
order
shall
be
binding
on
the
parties
of
the
action
and
persons
acting
in
concert,
and
participation
with
them.
mr.
norton
j.
come
would
receive
actual
notice.
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
however,
goes
on
to
add
that
rule
65
(d)
really
reflects
the
old
common
law
of
policy
that
an
injunction
can't
go
beyond
binding
the
parties
to
the
action,
and
those
persons
in
privity
or
legally
identified
with
them.
now,
and
furthermore
that
the
reason
that
you
have
that
limitation
is
that
you
don't
want
an
injunction
binding
someone
whose
rights
have
not
been
adjudicated
by
the
court.
now,
we
believe
that
the
board's
--
the
principle
the
board
is
applying
here
comports
with
the
basic
policies
underlying
65
(d)
in
that
that
a
successor
employer
for
purposes
of
the
act,
the
kind
of
employer
that
i
have
been
talking
about
at
least
the
one
in
this
case,
could
be
found
to
be
in
privity
or
legally
identified
with
the
original
party
of
this
action.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
referring
to
the
labor
policy.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
why
i
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
show
and
i've
done
so
in
more
detail
in
our
brief
that
simply
as
a
matter
of
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
is
reasonable
and
proper
to
impose
on
a
successor
employer
the
obligation
to
remedy
the
predecessor’s
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
to
find
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
furthermore,
with
respect
to
that
part
of
regal
that
attempts
to
ensure
that
you
won't
hold
somebody
whose
rights
have
not
been
adjudicated,
the
board
does
not
hold
a
successor
until
the
successor
is
given
notice
of
its
intention
to
apply
the
order
to
it,
and
a
opportunity
at
a
hearing
to
show
that
it
is
not
a
successor.
that
it
did
not
take
with
knowledge
and
that
it
would
otherwise
be
inappropriate
to
apply
the
order
to
it.
that
opportunity
was
fully
afforded
all
american
here,
and
it
took
full
advantage
of
the
opportunity.
so
we
believe
that
if
we're
right
on
the
policies
underlying
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
65
(d)
would
afford
no
obstacle
to
holding
the
successor
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
he
might
however
have
the
opportunity
to
show
that
he
would
have
no
room
to
take
him
back
which
might
affect
whether
or
not
the
reinstatement
obligation
would
apply
to
him,
or
whether
he
would
merely
be
required
to
put
him
on
a
preferential
hiring
list
in
the
case
any
vacancies
open
up.
