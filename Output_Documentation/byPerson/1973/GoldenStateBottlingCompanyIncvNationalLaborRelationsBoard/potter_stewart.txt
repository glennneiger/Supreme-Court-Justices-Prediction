the

here
remained
in
business
as
a
corporation.
justice

stewart
and
was
actively
in
business
and
it
wasn't
just
an
empty
shell.
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
a
corporation
in
being
with
assets
and
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
concluding
clause
of
yours
is
one
that's
very
much
in
dispute
despite
the
findings
below,
we're
told
they're
clearly
erroneous,
wholly
without
support
in
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
question
you
stated
is
assumes
the
answer
to
another
issue
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
was
that?
how
can
you
impute
his
knowledge,
if
he
had
knowledge
as
an
employee
of
golden
state
was
it
not?
and
the
very
mere
fact
that
schilling
was
later
hired
by
all
american
means
that
schilling's
knowledge
means
that
prior
knowledge
meant
that
golden
state
had
prior
knowledge?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
very
--
isn't
that
a
very
odd
application
of
agency
law?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
you
tell
us
to
the
fact
he
was
in
negotiations
would
allow
a
permissible
inference
on
the
part
of
the
board
that
he
imparted
this
information
which
to
me
is
quite
a
big
step.
but
then
you
said
that
his
knowledge
as
an
employee
of
golden
state
could
be
imputed
to
all
american
and
that
to
me,
i
was
surprised
or
i
found
that
rather
an
impossible
step
as
a
matter
of
agency
law.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
that
discredits
the
denial
and
that
leaves
the
state
of
the
evidence
in
equipoise.
he
discredits
the
denials
because
of
the
inferences
that
you
said
he
was
permitted
to
draw
and
so
now
it's
an
equipoise,
and
who
had
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
potter
stewart
well
so
could
you
if
you
had
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
despite
the
fact
that
the
only
actual
evidence
in
the
record
on
this
issue
was
that
there
was
no
knowledge.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
other
than
the
inferences
you're
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
testimonial
evidence
was
all
of
it
un-contradicted
was
that
was
no
knowledge,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
that
it
was
disbelieved,
you
said.
justice
potter
stewart
he
must
take
them
on
if
afforded
by
the
board
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
board
has
part
of
the
remedy
orders
reinstatement
that's
--
