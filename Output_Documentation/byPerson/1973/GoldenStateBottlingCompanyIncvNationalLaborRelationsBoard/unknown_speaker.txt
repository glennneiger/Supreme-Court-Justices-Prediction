unknown
speaker
is
there
any
disagreement
as
to
the
applicability
of
federal
rule
65
(d)
to
the
labor
board?
unknown
speaker
of
course
by
its
terms
i
always
thought
that
federal
rules
are
applicable
to
the
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
issue
here
both
your
client's
liability
for
pre-merger,
pre-acquisition
back
pay
and
post
acquisition
back
pay.
unknown
speaker
and
reinstatement.
unknown
speaker
now
for
pre-acquisition,
back
pay
there
had
been
an
adjudicated
liability?
unknown
speaker
yes
i
understand,
they
owe
that.
unknown
speaker
they
owe
that.
unknown
speaker
now
in
mergers
normally
under
state
law
you
can't
get
away
with
evading
your
clear
debts
by
transferring
away
your
property
and
did
the
succeeding
corporation
here
assume
any
debts
of
the
predecessors?
unknown
speaker
which
would
certainly
be
normal?
unknown
speaker
it
was
an
asset
purchase
and
you
assume
certain
--
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose,
perhaps
under
state
law
if
the
predecessor
didn't
pay
it,
you
might
have
to.
i
mean
just
as
a
--
unknown
speaker
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
was
an
adjudicated
liability
of
the
predecessor?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
under
state
law
a
--
unknown
speaker
a
seller
of
assets
can
avoid
the
payment
of
a
judgment
by
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
wouldn't
it
remain
a
claim
on
the
assets
he
conveys
away?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
fundamental
and
fraudulent
conveyance?
unknown
speaker
by
any
event
the
board
purported
to
make
the
successor
liable
for
back
pay
based
on
labor
policy,
right?
unknown
speaker
was
this
case
before
the
board
pre
burns?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
post
burns.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
burns
resolved
in
some
new
rules
of
the
road
with
respect
to
successorships
and
the
obligation
of
a
successor
to
hire
a
predecessor's
employees?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
under
pre
burns’s
law
that
you
would've
had
to
hire
your
predecessors’
employees
unless
you
could
fire
them
for
a
cause
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
unknown
speaker
yes,
will
i
think
i
understand
it,
was
that
through
pre
burns?
unknown
speaker
if
this
man
had
been
reinstated
before
the
transfer
--
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
to
keep
him
on?
unknown
speaker
but
the
argument
is
that
because
he
wasn't
--
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
as
i
understand
the
board’s
position
in
burns,
the
board
was
arguing
that
the
successor
assumed
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
obligations
under
collective
bargaining
contract.
one
of
which
is
you
don't
fire
without
cause.
unknown
speaker
rather
substantial
position.
unknown
speaker
well
of
course
the
deals
agreed
with
you,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
--
the
burden
of
proof?
excuse
me
i
didn't
--
unknown
speaker
what's
the
argument
mr.
come,
that
burns
put
a
different
light
on
this
case?
what
is
the
argument?
you
mean
--
i'm
sure
you
don't
--
but
the
dissenting
judge
below
thought
that
burns
did
make
a
difference
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
how
did
he
recognize
that?
how
did
burn
recognize
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
was
because
he
was
a
successor.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is,
my
question
is
that
is
whether
or
not
arguably
burns
does
have
a
bearing
on
the
case
and
the
board
should
look
at
it
again
in
the
light
of
burns.
this
was
the
board
acted
pre
burns.
yes.
unknown
speaker
both
you
and
your
opponent
rely
on
the
regal
case.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that,
if
that
issue
disposed
off
it,
in
favor
of
either
one
of
you
just
the
10
(c)
argument,
well
i
suppose
there's
no
need
to
go
back
to
the
board,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
if
the
predecessors
here
had
reinstated
this
employee
one
day
before
the
sale,
the
successor
needn't
have
kept
him
on.
unknown
speaker
oh!
no,
now
mr.
come
he
doesn't
need
to
hire
anybody.
unknown
speaker
at
all.
unknown
speaker
i'll
agree
with
that
mr.
come,
but
all
he
would
have
had
to
done
is
say
"i
do
not
want
you."
unknown
speaker
no,
he'd
be
--
would
be
hired.
he's
just
not
hired
by
a
successor
who
just
bought
the
assets.
unknown
speaker
now
you
seem
to
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless,
if
he
had
been
reinstated
the
day
before,
this
man
would
not
need
to
have
been
kept
on
by
the
successor.
unknown
speaker
but
he
wasn't
put
back
on
and
you
say
"therefore
he
must
be
hired."
unknown
speaker
with
that
if
he
just
said
"i
don't
want
you."
well,
it's
just
like
he
wouldn't
need
to
hire
anybody
else
any
other
prior
employee.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
no
unfair
labor
practice?
he
just
doesn't?
he
says,
when
the
fellow
comes
back
he
says,
"you're
among
those
that
i
don't
want
to
hire."
unknown
speaker
mr.
come
just
one
last
question.
if
he
need
not
take
him
on
it
all,
why
if
he
does
take
him
on
must
he
take
him
on
with
this
albatross
around
his
neck?
unknown
speaker
he
must
take
them
on
you'll
say?
unknown
speaker
can
you
say
regal
knitwear
actually
settles
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
your
position?
unknown
speaker
would
receive
actual
notice?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
opponent
says
that
under
state
law
that
is
not
so.
that
this
successor
if
you
want
to
call
him
a
successor
would've
not
been
liable
for
any
back
pay
to
this
employee.
it
was
just
wasn't
one
of
those
obligations
for
which
he
would've
been
liable.
unknown
speaker
--
and
so
what
law
are
you
referring
to
when
you
say
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
bootstrapping
then,
because
that's
the
issue
in
the
case,
that
does
labor
law
impose
an
obligation?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
there's
room
within
the
rule
for
that.
unknown
speaker
and
that
regal
allows
that
much
room
with
them.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
did
you
assume
it?
unknown
speaker
was
that
one
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
did
you
negotiate
a
new
one
or
did
you
just
assume
it.
unknown
speaker
and
which
included
into
the
–-
unknown
speaker
which
included
the
provision
that
i
suppose
you
won't
fire
without
cause.
unknown
speaker
well
let's
assume
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
jackson,
it
may
not
be
an
issue
in
the
case
before
now.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
any
other
employee
you
had
decided
you
didn't
want
to
take
on,
and
you
had
no
reason
whatsoever
for
it.
you
would
have
been
in
trouble
with
the
union,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
still
think
that
if
you
assumed
it
with
the
union
and
one
of
its
members
you
decided
not
to
take
on
for
no
reason,
you
would've
been
in
some
trouble?
unknown
speaker
well
what
about
this
fellow?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
gather,
this
fellow
was
a
member
of
the
unit?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
union
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but,
you
just
said
this
was
not
a
part
of
the
merger
or
part
of
the
sale
proposition.
this
was
just
a
way
--
unknown
speaker
about
hiring
and
arranging
your
labor
affairs?
unknown
speaker
independently
with
the
union?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
was
the
sales
law
your
--
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
give
notice
to
creditors.
unknown
speaker
was
there
notice
to
creditors
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
this
gives
creditors
the
opportunity
to
make
--
unknown
speaker
--
sure
that
their
debts
are
going
to
be
paid?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
lastly,
i
would
like
to
draw
for
just
a
moment
on
this
criterion
for
successorship.
we
indicated
that
the
identity
of
the
unit
before
and
after
the
transfer
is
of
course
pertinent
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
new
expression
of
employee
choice
for
the
bargaining
representative,
would
have
go
through
this
exercise,
and
this
makes
sense.
but
in
applying
this
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
successor
and
has
becoming
a
term
of
art,
for
purposes
of
liability.
i
suspect
as
practical
matter,
the
board
has
said
to
itself,
if
there
is
substantial
identity
of
unit,
and
of
personnel,
and
of
work
then
it's
highly
probable
that
but
for
this
discrimination
the
man
would've
been
hired,
and
i
suggest
this
is
probably
the
reason
for
this
criterion.
on
the
implied
or
the
imputation
of
knowledge
argument,
i
should
like,
if
i
may
to
point
out
to
the
court,
that
one
of
the
principal
arguments
advanced
for
this
knowledge
requirement
is
that
if
affords
to
the
purchaser
the
ability
to
protect
himself
against
this
possible
liability
by
indemnity
agreements
in
this
sort
of
thing.
however,
by
resorting
to
this
imputation
argument,
which
the
board
in
effect
is
taking
away
this
protection,
because
by
having
to
resort
to
such
a
fictional
device
in
order
to
result
in
a
finding
of
knowledge.
the
board
is
in
effect
seeding
effect
that
no
actual
knowledge
existed
on
the
part
of
this
purchaser.
and
therefore
this
opportunity
to
protect
itself
and
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
the
extent
to
which
this
might
result
in
liability,
did
not
in
fact
exist.
and
i
think
this
is
another
aspect
of
the
thing
which
argues
the
frailty
of
this
argument.
i
would
point
out
lastly
that
regal
knitwear,
this
all
for
other
reasons
language
to
be
found
at
the
tail
end
of
this
one
example
given
by
justice
jackson,
does
not
open
the
door
to
any
other
thing
--
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
disagreement
as
to
the
applicability
of
federal
rule
65
(d)
to
the
labor
board?
unknown
speaker
of
course
by
its
terms
i
always
thought
that
federal
rules
are
applicable
to
the
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
issue
here
both
your
client's
liability
for
pre-merger,
pre-acquisition
back
pay
and
post
acquisition
back
pay.
unknown
speaker
and
reinstatement.
unknown
speaker
now
for
pre-acquisition,
back
pay
there
had
been
an
adjudicated
liability?
unknown
speaker
yes
i
understand,
they
owe
that.
unknown
speaker
they
owe
that.
unknown
speaker
now
in
mergers
normally
under
state
law
you
can't
get
away
with
evading
your
clear
debts
by
transferring
away
your
property
and
did
the
succeeding
corporation
here
assume
any
debts
of
the
predecessors?
unknown
speaker
which
would
certainly
be
normal?
unknown
speaker
it
was
an
asset
purchase
and
you
assume
certain
--
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose,
perhaps
under
state
law
if
the
predecessor
didn't
pay
it,
you
might
have
to.
i
mean
just
as
a
--
unknown
speaker
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
was
an
adjudicated
liability
of
the
predecessor?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
under
state
law
a
--
unknown
speaker
a
seller
of
assets
can
avoid
the
payment
of
a
judgment
by
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
wouldn't
it
remain
a
claim
on
the
assets
he
conveys
away?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
fundamental
and
fraudulent
conveyance?
unknown
speaker
by
any
event
the
board
purported
to
make
the
successor
liable
for
back
pay
based
on
labor
policy,
right?
unknown
speaker
was
this
case
before
the
board
pre
burns?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
post
burns.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
burns
resolved
in
some
new
rules
of
the
road
with
respect
to
successorships
and
the
obligation
of
a
successor
to
hire
a
predecessor's
employees?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
under
pre
burns’s
law
that
you
would've
had
to
hire
your
predecessors’
employees
unless
you
could
fire
them
for
a
cause
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
unknown
speaker
yes,
will
i
think
i
understand
it,
was
that
through
pre
burns?
unknown
speaker
if
this
man
had
been
reinstated
before
the
transfer
--
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
to
keep
him
on?
unknown
speaker
but
the
argument
is
that
because
he
wasn't
--
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
as
i
understand
the
board’s
position
in
burns,
the
board
was
arguing
that
the
successor
assumed
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
obligations
under
collective
bargaining
contract.
one
of
which
is
you
don't
fire
without
cause.
unknown
speaker
rather
substantial
position.
unknown
speaker
well
of
course
the
deals
agreed
with
you,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
--
the
burden
of
proof?
excuse
me
i
didn't
--
unknown
speaker
what's
the
argument
mr.
come,
that
burns
put
a
different
light
on
this
case?
what
is
the
argument?
you
mean
--
i'm
sure
you
don't
--
but
the
dissenting
judge
below
thought
that
burns
did
make
a
difference
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
how
did
he
recognize
that?
how
did
burn
recognize
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
was
because
he
was
a
successor.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is,
my
question
is
that
is
whether
or
not
arguably
burns
does
have
a
bearing
on
the
case
and
the
board
should
look
at
it
again
in
the
light
of
burns.
this
was
the
board
acted
pre
burns.
yes.
unknown
speaker
both
you
and
your
opponent
rely
on
the
regal
case.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that,
if
that
issue
disposed
off
it,
in
favor
of
either
one
of
you
just
the
10
(c)
argument,
well
i
suppose
there's
no
need
to
go
back
to
the
board,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
if
the
predecessors
here
had
reinstated
this
employee
one
day
before
the
sale,
the
successor
needn't
have
kept
him
on.
unknown
speaker
oh!
no,
now
mr.
come
he
doesn't
need
to
hire
anybody.
unknown
speaker
at
all.
unknown
speaker
i'll
agree
with
that
mr.
come,
but
all
he
would
have
had
to
done
is
say
"i
do
not
want
you."
unknown
speaker
no,
he'd
be
--
would
be
hired.
he's
just
not
hired
by
a
successor
who
just
bought
the
assets.
unknown
speaker
now
you
seem
to
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless,
if
he
had
been
reinstated
the
day
before,
this
man
would
not
need
to
have
been
kept
on
by
the
successor.
unknown
speaker
but
he
wasn't
put
back
on
and
you
say
"therefore
he
must
be
hired."
unknown
speaker
with
that
if
he
just
said
"i
don't
want
you."
well,
it's
just
like
he
wouldn't
need
to
hire
anybody
else
any
other
prior
employee.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
no
unfair
labor
practice?
he
just
doesn't?
he
says,
when
the
fellow
comes
back
he
says,
"you're
among
those
that
i
don't
want
to
hire."
unknown
speaker
mr.
come
just
one
last
question.
if
he
need
not
take
him
on
it
all,
why
if
he
does
take
him
on
must
he
take
him
on
with
this
albatross
around
his
neck?
unknown
speaker
he
must
take
them
on
you'll
say?
unknown
speaker
can
you
say
regal
knitwear
actually
settles
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
your
position?
unknown
speaker
would
receive
actual
notice?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
opponent
says
that
under
state
law
that
is
not
so.
that
this
successor
if
you
want
to
call
him
a
successor
would've
not
been
liable
for
any
back
pay
to
this
employee.
it
was
just
wasn't
one
of
those
obligations
for
which
he
would've
been
liable.
unknown
speaker
--
and
so
what
law
are
you
referring
to
when
you
say
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
bootstrapping
then,
because
that's
the
issue
in
the
case,
that
does
labor
law
impose
an
obligation?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
there's
room
within
the
rule
for
that.
unknown
speaker
and
that
regal
allows
that
much
room
with
them.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
did
you
assume
it?
unknown
speaker
was
that
one
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
did
you
negotiate
a
new
one
or
did
you
just
assume
it.
unknown
speaker
and
which
included
into
the
–-
unknown
speaker
which
included
the
provision
that
i
suppose
you
won't
fire
without
cause.
unknown
speaker
well
let's
assume
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
jackson,
it
may
not
be
an
issue
in
the
case
before
now.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
any
other
employee
you
had
decided
you
didn't
want
to
take
on,
and
you
had
no
reason
whatsoever
for
it.
you
would
have
been
in
trouble
with
the
union,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
still
think
that
if
you
assumed
it
with
the
union
and
one
of
its
members
you
decided
not
to
take
on
for
no
reason,
you
would've
been
in
some
trouble?
unknown
speaker
well
what
about
this
fellow?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
gather,
this
fellow
was
a
member
of
the
unit?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
union
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but,
you
just
said
this
was
not
a
part
of
the
merger
or
part
of
the
sale
proposition.
this
was
just
a
way
--
unknown
speaker
about
hiring
and
arranging
your
labor
affairs?
unknown
speaker
independently
with
the
union?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
was
the
sales
law
your
--
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
give
notice
to
creditors.
unknown
speaker
was
there
notice
to
creditors
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
this
gives
creditors
the
opportunity
to
make
--
unknown
speaker
--
sure
that
their
debts
are
going
to
be
paid?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
lastly,
i
would
like
to
draw
for
just
a
moment
on
this
criterion
for
successorship.
we
indicated
that
the
identity
of
the
unit
before
and
after
the
transfer
is
of
course
pertinent
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
new
expression
of
employee
choice
for
the
bargaining
representative,
would
have
go
through
this
exercise,
and
this
makes
sense.
but
in
applying
this
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
successor
and
has
becoming
a
term
of
art,
for
purposes
of
liability.
i
suspect
as
practical
matter,
the
board
has
said
to
itself,
if
there
is
substantial
identity
of
unit,
and
of
personnel,
and
of
work
then
it's
highly
probable
that
but
for
this
discrimination
the
man
would've
been
hired,
and
i
suggest
this
is
probably
the
reason
for
this
criterion.
on
the
implied
or
the
imputation
of
knowledge
argument,
i
should
like,
if
i
may
to
point
out
to
the
court,
that
one
of
the
principal
arguments
advanced
for
this
knowledge
requirement
is
that
if
affords
to
the
purchaser
the
ability
to
protect
himself
against
this
possible
liability
by
indemnity
agreements
in
this
sort
of
thing.
however,
by
resorting
to
this
imputation
argument,
which
the
board
in
effect
is
taking
away
this
protection,
because
by
having
to
resort
to
such
a
fictional
device
in
order
to
result
in
a
finding
of
knowledge.
the
board
is
in
effect
seeding
effect
that
no
actual
knowledge
existed
on
the
part
of
this
purchaser.
and
therefore
this
opportunity
to
protect
itself
and
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
the
extent
to
which
this
might
result
in
liability,
did
not
in
fact
exist.
and
i
think
this
is
another
aspect
of
the
thing
which
argues
the
frailty
of
this
argument.
i
would
point
out
lastly
that
regal
knitwear,
this
all
for
other
reasons
language
to
be
found
at
the
tail
end
of
this
one
example
given
by
justice
jackson,
does
not
open
the
door
to
any
other
thing
