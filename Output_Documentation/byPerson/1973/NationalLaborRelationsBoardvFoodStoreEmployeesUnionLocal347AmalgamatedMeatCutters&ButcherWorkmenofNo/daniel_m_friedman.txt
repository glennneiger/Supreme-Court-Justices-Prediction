mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
to
the
court.
in
a
large
number
of
cases,
this
court
has
recognized
the
limited
role
that
courts
of
appeals
have
in
reviewing
the
scope
of
remedial
orders
of
administrative
agencies.
the
standard
governing
such
review
has
been
formulated
in
different
ways,
but
there
the
court
had
said
it
before
the
appellate
court
attempts
to
change
the
remedy,
it
must
find
that
the
remedy
selected
has
no
reasonable
relation
to
the
unlawful
practices
found
that
it
constitute
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion
albeit
the
agency
has
not
made
an
allowable
choose
of
remedy.
now
this
principle
has
also
been
applied
to
orders
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
this
court
having
recently
stated
in
gissel
case
that
those
orders
are
entitled
to
special
respect.
all
of
those
cases
have
been
ones
in
which
the
remedy
provided
by
the
agency
has
been
challenge
because
it
assertedly
went
too
far.
the
agency
did
something
more
either
that
was
permitted
to
do
under
to
the
statute
or
that
was
claimed
as
necessary
to
deal
with
the
problem
before
the
agency.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
failed
to
go
as
far
as
it
should
have
gone
in
providing
appropriate
remedies.
specifically,
because
the
board
failed
to
grant
a
union
request
that
in
addition
to
a
number
of
other
remedies
that
the
board
had
provided,
it
did
not
require
the
employer
to
reimburse
the
union
for
counsel
fees
expended
and
extraordinary
organizational
expenses
it
had.
in
connection
with
an
organizing
drive
result
where
the
employer
had
committed
serious
unfair
labor
practices
against
it.
we
have
brought
the
case
to
this
court
because
we
think
that
the
standard
governing
the
proper
scope
of
judicial
review
of
agency
orders
should
be
the
same
and
must
be
the
same
whether
the
order
is
challenged
as
excessive
or
inadequate.
and
indeed,
as
i
understand
the
union
has
no
disagreement
with
us.
the
union
said,
“yes,
the
standard
is
the
same,
but
under
standard
the
board
acted
improperly.”
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
may
i
address
that
right
now.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
let
me
--
i
think
it
will
be
a
convenient
point
to
address
it
right
now.
heck’s
was
a
party
of
course
before
the
board
and
all
of
the
proceedings.
on
the
cases
before
the
court
of
appeals
the
first
time,
heck’s
intervened
that
it
has
a
right
as
it
had
a
right
to
do.
when
the
case
came
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
second
time
heck’s
did
not
intervene
although
it
had
a
right
to
do
so,
and
a
case
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
assumption
by
the
both
the
board
and
the
union
that
the
board
had
this
authority.
heck’s
could
have
intervened
but
didn’t.
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
assumed
the
board
had
this
authority
but
held
that
the
board
have
failed
to
exercise
it.
it
was
only
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
to
provide
these
remedies
that
heck’s
then
sought
to
intervene
before
the
court
of
appeals.
that
was
denied
by
the
court
presumably
as
untimely
because
under
the
rules
and
application
for
intervention
it's
required
to
file
within
30
days
of
filing
a
petition
to
review.
heck’s
then
sought
review
in
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
but
denial
of
intervention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
denial
of
intervention,
that
was
denied,
that
was
denied.
following
that,
heck’s
was
permitted
to
intervene
by
the
court
of
appeals
approximately
six
weeks
after
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
filed.
now,
we
have
filed
a
supplemental
memorandum
in
this
case.
it’s
a
xerox
document
that
we
were
unable
to
file
unfortunately
until
last
friday
in
which
we
discussed
this
problem
at
considerable
length.
we
say,
suggest
to
the
court
is
first
of
all,
we
think
it
is
very
dubious;
whether
after
this
court
has
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
court
of
appeals
can
then
grant
intervention
so
as
to
permit
someone
to
become
a
party
in
the
proceeding
to
this
court.
we
think
when
this
court
has
taken
the
case
that
at
least
ousts
the
court
of
appeals
of
authority
to
make
then
someone
a
party.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
did
not.
they
did
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
after
initially
denying
and
i
found
that
also
that
this
court,
and
they
denied
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court,
but
we
don’t
know
why.
now
this
issue
was
never
been
raised
because
this
court.
it’s
not
raise
by
the
board.
it
is
not
raise
by
union.
the
union
concedes
it
and
i’m
not
sure
exactly
what
status
the
employer
believes
it
has
in
this
case.
on
the
one
hand,
it
has
now
amended
the
caption
to
show
itself
as
the
respondent,
on
the
other
hand,
at
page
2
of
its
brief,
it
asked
leave
to
intervene.
the
court
of
appeals
--
this
court
incidentally
had
denied
a
petition
for
rehearing
of
that
in
march
i
believe
--
early
this
month
and
it
just
seems
to
us
this
issue
was
not
properly
presented.
this
is
not
the
way
in
which
this
kind
of
a
question
should
be
(inaudible).
the
very
question
--
the
very
question
that
the
employer
seeks
to
raise
in
this
case
is
now
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
tiidee
case
to
which
i
shall
refer,
that
case
was
argued
in
september
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
the
same
court
that
decided
this
case
in
which
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
board’s
authority
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
board’s
power
to
do.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
think
the
board
has
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
we
think
the
board
has
that
power
and
the
union
of
course
agrees
with
us.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it’s
not.
it’s
not
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
stand
corrected
mr.
justice.
it
is
a
claim.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
not
at
issue
as
far
as
the
parties
are
concerned.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
suggestion
by
the
employer
is
that
it's
somehow
anomalous
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
the
board
in
this
case
properly
refused
to
award
the
fees
if
in
fact
as
they
claim,
it
has
no
authority
at
all.
we
have
cited
signed
it
our
supplemental
memorandum,
a
decision
of
this
court,
two
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
think
are
very
close.
some
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
a
private
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
recover
for
violation
of
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
without
deciding
whether
or
not
such
as
suit
would
lie.
about
three
to
four
years
later,
the
question
came
up
and
this
court
then
held
in
the
national
mill
case
that
in
fact
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
not
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
for
which
a
private
action
would
lie.
so
it
seems
to
us
this
is
a
case
in
which
this
contention
that
the
employer
has
made
is
not
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
no
means
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justices.
i
don’t
see
how
our
questions
could
possibly
be
viewed
as
raising
any
issue
with
respect
to
the
board’s
power.
it’s
a
strange
thing.
what
the
employer
is
doing
is
urging
an
alternative
ground
not
for
affirmance,
but
for
reversal,
a
ground
that
the
parties
have
not
raised
and
that
as
far
as
we’re
concerned
is
not
--
this
is
it
seems
to
us
is
not
the
proper
context
and
posture
in
which
to
litigate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
union
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we
have
not
joined
in
the
motion
mr.
justice,
but
what
we
have
said,
we
spent
two
or
three
pages
in
this
supplemental
memorandum
suggesting
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
it’s
--
unfortunately
it's
not
printed
at
the
moment,
but
we
hope
it
will
be
printed
by
the
end
of
the
week.
it’s
being
printed
now,
but
we
filed
it
because
of
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
done
nothing
with
respect
to
that
motion.
we
have
filed
a
memorandum
or
brief
in
answer
to
the
union’s
brief
because
we
don’t
know
how
the
court
is
going
to
treat
it,
i’m
sorry,
the
employer’s
brief,
we
don’t
know
how
the
court
is
going
to
treat
it,
but
we
give
a
number
of
reasons
as
to
why
we
don’t
think
the
court
should
consider
the
argument
and
then
very
briefly
just
indicate
our
view
as
to
why
we
i
think
the
board
has
that
power
in
rather
summary
fashion
because
we
got
much
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
much
mr.
justice.
it
would
seem
to
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
isn’t.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don’t
think
that
issue
is
probably
before
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
filed
mr.
justice.
they
at
the
same
time
that
the
court
granted
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari,
it
denied
heck’s
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
denial
of
intervention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
our
position.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
the
court
mr.
justice
this
morning
denied
leave
to
file.
the
court
denied
leave
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
it
physically
with
you,
but
we
believe
that
in
the
light
of
the
court’s
action
that
is
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
now,
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
sorry.
i
apologize.
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
it
was
denying
the
order
the
leave
to
the
chamber
of
commerce
to
follow
brief
in
support
of
that
about
the
heck’s
brief
is
before
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there’s
a
motion
to
strike
it
made
by
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
that
is
before
the
court,
the
motion.
the
motion
to
strike
or
apart
from
the
motion
to
strike
whether
the
court
will
consider
the
merits
of
that.
i
mean,
the
court
could
have
of
course
keep
the
motion,
the
brief
on
file,
but
declined
as
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
the
union’s
motion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we’re
not
joining
it
as
such.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
[laughter]i
don’t
know
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
your
question
indicates
the
reason
for
the
rule
that
a
party
has
to
seek
timely
intervention
before
the
court
of
appeals.
heck’s
could
have
protected
itself
completely
in
this
case
had
it
sort
timely
intervention
before
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
let
me
if
i
may
get
to
the
basic
issue
in
the
case
as
i
said
there’s
no
dispute
over
the
fact
of
the
standard
is
the
same,
and
therefore,
the
case
comes
down
to
as
whether
in
the
facts
of
this
case
the
board
abused
its
discretion,
did
something
that
was
patently
irrational
or
illegal
in
declining
the
union,
the
additional
remedies
which
it
had
here
sought.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes.
we
agree
the
employer
and
the
board
are
in
agreement
that
the
board
properly
declined
these
additional
remedies.
we
disagree
with
heck’s.
we
think
we
have
the
power
to
grant
those
remedies,
heck’s
says
we
do
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
review
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice,
but
in
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals
it
seems
to
me
it
has
to
look
at
the
limited
role
the
court
of
appeals
place
in
this
thing
that
is
whether
in
all
of
the
circumstances,
whether
in
all
of
the
circumstances,
it
can
be
said
that
the
board
patently
abused
its
discretion.
that
it’s
conclusion
here
that
these
additional
remedies
were
not
necessary
or
no
relation
to
its
permissible
views
as
to
what
the
act
requires.
now,
unfortunately
it
will
need
a
somewhat
detailed
discussion
of
the
facts
because
this
board
decision
here
is
involved
with
the
board
subsequent
decision
in
the
tiidee
case
and
since
the
court
of
appeals
held
not
that
the
board
had
improperly
exercised
its
discretion
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
the
board’s
rationale
in
this
case
was
insufficient.
that
was
not
the
theory
on
which
it
held
the
board
was
required
to
give
these
remedies.
the
theory
was
that
what
the
board
had
done
in
the
tiidee
case.
somehow
undermined
its
decision
here.
so
in
my
presentation,
i
will
focus
mainly
on
what
the
board
did
in
this
case,
what
the
board
did
in
the
tiidee
case.
the
case
arose
out
of
an
attempt
by
the
union
to
organize
a
retail
store
operated
by
heck’s
in
clarksburg,
west
virginia.
heck’s
as
is
customarily
for
it,
strongly
resisted
the
union
and
engaged
in
a
variety
of
unfair
labor
practices.
i
use
the
word
“customarily”
because
heck’s
is
not
stranger
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
the
past
few
years,
it
has
been
a
respondent
in
11
different
proceedings.
and
the
board
found
in
this
case
that
this
was
part
of
a
general
plan
by
heck’s,
conducted
by
its
two
principle
officers,
it's
president
and
vice
president
to
resist
unionization
at
every
stage
and
it
is
said
to
deny
its
employees
their
rights
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
what
the
heck’s
did
is
to
cause
customarily
ring
to
it.
they
threatened
and
coerced
employees
who
were
active
in
the
union.
they
conducted
a
non-secret
poll
of
the
employees
as
to
who
is
interested
in
the
union.
they
threatened
that
if
the
union
got
in,
they’d
close
the
store
and
then
they
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union,
even
though
as
the
board
found
the
union
enjoyed
a
representation
status
with
respect
to
a
majority
of
the
employees.
the
union
had
obtained
cards,
authorization
cards
and
that
was
basis
on
which
it
sought
to
bargain
with
the
company.
now,
this
is
of
some
significance
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
case
we
have
here.
heck’s
asserted
that
it
had
a
good
faith
doubt
with
respect
to
whether
in
fact
the
union
represented
a
majority
of
its
employees
and
the
examiner
agreed
with
heck’s
on
this.
the
examiner
said
yes
on
all
the
facts
we
think
heck’s
did
have
a
good
faith
doubt,
the
board
however
reject
that.
as
a
remedy
for
these
unfair
labor
practices,
the
board
adopted
what
is
its
conventional
remedy.
it
entered
a
cease
and
desist
order.
it
directed
the
employer
depose
to
various
notices
in
its
plant
and
it
also
directed
the
employer
on
request
to
bargain
with
the
union
finding
that
the
employer’s
unfair
labor
practices
had
made
it
impossible
at
that
point
to
hold
a
fair
election.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
board’s
findings
of
violation
and
said
that
the
board’s
order
was
fine
as
far
as
it
went,
but
that
it
didn’t
go
far
enough,
and
therefore,
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
a
court
of
appeals
tiidee’s
opinion.
now,
on
the
remand,
the
board
granted
some,
but
not
all
of
the
remedies
that
the
union
had
sought.
specifically,
it
added
these
remedies.
it
required
the
employer
to
mail
this
notice
which
had
previously
ordered
posted
in
the
plants
to
every
employee
at
his
or
her
home.
it
directed
the
employer
to
give
the
union
access
to
company
bulletin
boards
for
a
period
of
the
year
and
it
also
directed
the
employer
to
make
available
to
the
union
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
the
employees
and
to
keep
list
current
for
a
year
to
facilitate
the
union’s
communication
with
its
employees.
the
board,
however,
refused
to
grant
certain
other
requests
that
the
union
had
made.
it
refused
to
grant
an
order
for
company
wide
bargaining.
it
refused
to
order
the
employer
to
read
the
notices
to
the
employees
at
an
assemblage
and
it
declined
to
award
attorney’s
fees
and
excess
organizational
expenditures.
the
board
recognized
there
was
a
probability
that
as
a
result
of
the
employer’s
unfair
labor
practices,
the
union
probably
spent
more
on
attorney’s
fees
and
organizational
fees
that
it
would
have
found
had
there
not
been
the
refusal
to
bargain.
but,
the
board
concluded
and
this
is
on
page
38
(a)
of
the
petition,
said
it
wouldn’t
unbalance,
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
to
require
reimbursement
by
the
employer
with
respect
to
these
items.
now,
when
the
board
spoke
of
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
act,
it
was
referring
to
the
statutory
provision
governing
the
board’s
authority
over
order.
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
which
gives
the
board
power
to
take
such
affirmative
action,
including
reinstatement
of
employees
with
or
without
backpay
as
will
effectuate
the
purpose,
the
policies
of
the
act.
the
basic
rationale
of
the
board’s
decision
in
this
case
was
that
the
special
role
of
a
charging
party
before
the
board,
the
group,
the
person
who
files
the
charges,
that
the
role
of
the
charging
party
was
such
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
carry
out
the
policies
of
the
act
as
a
general
rule
to
provide
for
attorney’s
fees
and
expert
organizational
expenses.
as
the
board
said,
i’m
reading
now
briefly
from
in
page
39
(a),
“it
is
the
board
which
has
been
given
primary
initial
responsibility
to
determine
and
protect
the
public
interest
in
the
elimination
of
obstructions
to
commerce
resulting
from
labor
disputes.
such
protection
of
the
public
interest
as
may
result
from
the
charging
parties
participation
in
litigation
must
be
regarded,
we
believe,
as
incidental
to
its
efforts
to
protect
its
own
private
interest.
given
this
statutory
framework,
we
conclude
that
the
public
interest
in
allowing
the
charging
party
to
recover,
the
cost
of
its
participation
in
this
litigation
does
not
override
the
general
and
well-established
principle
that
litigation
expenses
are
ordinarily
not
recovered.
well,
now,
the
union
disagrees
with
us
what
the
general
principle
is
with
respect
to
the
recoverability
of
litigation
expenses
in
this
country.
we
have
filed
a
brief.
we
argue
it
one
way.
the
union
on
argues
it
the
other.
not
infrequently
lawyers
disagree
as
to
what
the
cases
hold,
but
the
critical
thing,
we
think
about
this
is
this
was
just
really
an
additional
ground
the
board
relied
on.
the
clinical
language
we
think
is
the
language
on
page
38
that
on
balance
because
of
the
role
of
the
charging
party,
it
would
not
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
to
permit
reimbursement.
now,
i
just
might
mention
parenthetically
in
passing
since
this
is
important.
under
the
board’s
procedures,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
schofield
case,
it’s
the
board
that
has
the
laboring
oar
in
conducting
its
proceedings.
the
charging
party
has
a
party.
the
charging
party
can
may
play
a
greater
or
lesser
role,
but
it’s
the
board
that
conducts
the
proceedings.
it’s
the
board
for
example
that
makes
the
decision
whether
to
seek
enforcement
of
an
order.
the
charging
party
cannot
do
that.
it
is
the
board
that
has
the
sole
authority
to
cite
a
respondent
for
contempt
if
he
fails
to
comply
with
the
order.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
case
is
a
very
different
case
from
the
typical
situation
in
which
attorney’s
fees
have
been
awarded.
this
is
a
not
case
in
which
attorney’s
fees
have
to
be
awarded
in
order
to
encourage
people
to
conduct
litigation
where
that
litigation
is
an
important
element
of
implementing
the
statutory
programs
and
policies.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
as
result
of
a
litigant’s
activities,
benefit
has
been
conferred
upon
a
group
and
it’s
deemed
unfair
that
the
members
of
that
group
should
not
compensate
the
man
who
brought
the
suit.
i
mean,
in
the
case
in
the
woods
case,
the
case
last
year
under
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
in
the
cole
case
there
what
you
had
was
the
particular
employee
had
brought
a
suit
in
order
to
vindicate
his
right
to
a
free
speech
in
opposition
to
the
union.
the
court
held
that
attorney’s
fees
were
properly
paled
by
the
union
in
that
case
because
in
vindicating
his
right
of
free
speech,
he
was
also
vindicating
the
rights
of
free
speech
of
all
the
members
of
union
and
therefore
that
all
the
members
of
the
union
benefited
from
his
endeavors.
now
here,
obviously
all
the
members
of
the
union
benefited
from
the
union’s
activities,
but
it’s
the
members
of
the
union
who
should
pay
for
that.
certainly,
the
employer
in
this
case
cannot
be
deemed
the
beneficiary
of
a
litigation
the
union
conducted
in
this
case.
the
union
and
the
employer
were
at
odds.
now,
when
the
case
came
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
second
time,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
as
i’ve
indicated
in
any
way
that
it
disagreed
with
the
board’s
general
premise
that
ordinarily
because
of
the
nature
of
broad
proceedings
that
counsel
fees
and
organizational
expenses
should
not
be
awarded.
what
it
said
was
it
thought
the
board’s
rationale
in
this
case
had
been
undercut
by
it’s
decision
in
tiidee
case
and
that
the
board
now
in
effect
has
conceded
that
as
long
as
an
employer,
let
me
read
the
precise
language
the
court
of
appeals
used
because
i
think
it
indicates
the
essence
of
it’s
holding
in
this
case.
the
court
said
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
reading
from
page
10
(a)
of
the
first
appendix
to
the
petition.
unfortunately,
in
this
case
the
various
documents
divided
up
in
--
among
a
number
of
different
places.
what
the
court
said
is
a
bottom
of
the
--
just
before
the
paragraph
number
2
on
10
(a).
it
was
said
it
would
appear
that
board
is
now
recognized
that
employers
will
follow
a
pattern
of
resisting
union
organization
and
who
to
that
end
unduly
burden
the
processes
of
the
board
and
the
courts
should
be
oblige
at
the
very
least
to
respond
in
terms
of
making
good
the
legal
expenses
to
which
they
have
put
the
charging
parties
and
the
board.
we
hold
that
the
case
before
us
is
an
appropriate
one
for
according
such
relief.
we
think
in
this,
in
this
holding
the
board
has
completely
misinterpreted
the
board’s
decision
in
tiidee.
tiidee
was
another
case
similar
to
this
one;
an
employer
who
resisted
union
organization
demands,
who
refused
to
bargain
the
board
entered
the
conventional
remedies.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
primarily
to
consider
what
was
called
a
“make-whole”
remedy.
that
is
the
claim
of
the
union
that
relief
should
include
not
only
cease
and
desist,
etcetera,
etcetera,
but
also
to
pay
to
the
employees
the
amounts
the
board
thinks
they
would
have
gotten
had
there
been
a
contract.
that
was
the
main
issue
that
was
litigated
in
the
tiidee
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
could
see
them
mr.
justice.
yes,
the
tiidee
panel
where
judges
leventhal,
robinson
and
mcgowan,
this
panel
were
judges
leventhal,
bazelon,
and
mcgowan
and
judge
mcgowan
wrote
the
opinion.
now,
in
the
tiidee
case
after
this
lengthy
discussion,
the
court
almost
at
the
end
its
opinion
added
a
footnote.
i’m
sorry,
the
end
of
the
discussion
in
the
tiidee
opinion.
it
said
that
the
board
should
reconsider
on
the
remand,
other
lesser
remedies
beside
the
make-whole
and
one
of
the
things
it
said
to
consider
ultimate
remedies
such
as
an
award
to
the
union
for
excess
organization
costs,
caused
by
the
company’s
behavior,
or
for
the
cost
of
having
to
litigate
a
frivolous
case,
the
court’s
words,
frivolous
case
or
for
a
combination
of
this.
and
earlier
in
its
opinion
at
page
1249
at
426
f.2nd,
the
court
said,
“the
present
posture
of
the
board
encourages
frivolous
litigation
not
only
before
the
board
but
before
courts.”
that
is
the
present
posture
of
the
board
in
not
doing
anything
more
than
the
conventional
remedies.
in
its
tiidee
opinion,
the
board
specifically
granted
attorney’s
fees
because
this
was
frivolous
litigation
that
was
said.
to
refer
to
page
35
and
page
36
of
the
appendix,
the
brown
volume,
the
board
said
that
it
had
previously,
as
recently
noted,
normally
litigation
expenses
are
not
recoverable
by
the
charging
party
in
board
proceedings
even
though
the
public
interest
is
served
from
the
charging
party
protects
its
private
interest
before
the
board,
citing
its
decision
in
this
very
case.
and
it
went
on
to
say,
we
agree
with
the
court,
however,
the
frivolous
litigation
such
as
this
is
unwarranted.
but
then
it
went
on
to
say
the
statutory
policy
of
ensuring
rights
of
the
employees
is
encouraged
and
if
its
not
encouraged
further
when
this
frivolous
litigation.
and
it
said,
“in
order
discourage
frivolous
litigation,
future
frivolous
litigation,
page
36
of
the
appendix
and
to
serve
the
policies
of
the
act
we
decided
to
award
it.
three
times
in
its
discussion
at
pages
35-36
of
the
appendix
in
its
tiidee
opinion,
it
refers
to
frivolous
litigation.
when
it
came
to
access
organizational
expenses,
what
the
board
said
was
we're
not
going
to
award
them
because
as
we
view
this
case,
there
were
no
access
organizational
expenses.
the
union
in
two
months
won
in
election
19
to
6
and
it
didn’t
incur
any
excess
organizational
expenditures.
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
that
ruling
as
somehow
indicating
that
the
board
had
abandoned
its
rationale
in
heck’s.
somehow
because
the
board
had
not
said
in
the
heck’s
case,
i’m
sorry,
because
the
board
had
not
said
in
tiidee
case
while
we
have
--
while
we
generally
don’t
award
these
things,
we
don’t
have
reach
the
case
to
see
whether
it’s
an
exception
here,
whether
it’s
frivolous
litigation
because
in
this
situation
there
was
no
excess
expenditures
obtained.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
there
are
two
basic
points
i’d
like
to
make
about
what
the
board
did
in
this
case.
first,
we
think
the
board
was
preeminently
reasonable
in
light
of
the
statutory
scheme
in
concluding
that
as
a
general
rule,
attorney’s
fees
and
litigation
expenses
should
not
be
accorded
as
a
part
of
the
remedy
for
unfair
labor
practices.
that
we
think
is
the
general
rule
if
properly
promulgated.
we
also
think
it
acted
reasonably
in
creating
the
exception
it
did
in
tiidee
for
frivolous
litigation.
frivolous
litigation
stands
on
a
very
different
footing
from
litigation
in
which
although
there
are
substantial
questions
to
be
litigated,
nevertheless
ultimately
it’s
held
that
the
defendant
has
not
prevailed.
in
this
case,
in
this
case
although
the
board
found
that
the
employer
had
no
good
faith
doubt
about
the
union’s
--
the
employer
had
no
good
faith
doubt
about
the
union’s
majority
status,
the
employer
--
the
union
--
the
employee’s
contention
had
sufficient
substance
that
the
trial
examiner
went
the
other
way.
we
think
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
really
done
is
it
has
attempted
to
determine
what
in
fact
would
be
appropriate
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
what
would
be
appropriate
relief
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
that
is
a
decision
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
congress
has
committed
to
the
expert
opinion
of
the
board
and
not
to
the
courts
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
went
beyond
the
proper
scope
of
its
relief.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
just
really
one
or
two
related
points
i’d
like
to
make.
i
think
in
considering
the
propriety
of
what
the
board
did
in
this
case,
it’s
important
to
recognize
that
the
board
did
not
just
focus
on
whether
or
not
to
award
counsel
fees
and
organizational
expenses.
in
addition
to
the
normal
remedies
that
the
board
usually
provides
in
this
type
of
case,
the
board
provided
additional
remedies
here
on
the
remand
as
a
result
of
its
evaluation
of
the
employer’s
conduct.
that
is
in
addition
to
the
normal
cease
and
desist
order
in
the
posting
of
notices
here
in
order
to
aid
the
union,
the
board
required
that
the
employer
send
the
notices
out
to
each
employee
at
his
home,
required
that
the
employer
give
the
union
access
to
company
bulletin
boards
for
a
year
and
required
that
the
employer
finally
give
the
union
a
list
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
employees,
so
that
the
union
would
be
able
to
make
contact
more
easily
with
the
employees.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
those
remedies
would,
given
it
did
not
feel
as
a
general
rule,
it
should
give
the
additional
remedy
of
organizational
expenses
and
counsel
fees
because
in
the
light
of
the
nature
of
the
charging
party’s
limited
role,
this
case
was
not
one
in
which
that
additional
remedy,
in
addition
to
what
the
board
had
already
given,
was
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
now
the
board
did
refer
to
the
american
rule,
the
general
rule
that
ordinarily
in
the
absence
of
statute
or
contract,
attorney’s
fees
are
not
awarded
and
that
is
a
rule
which
this
court
has
recognized,
including
the
two
most
recent
cases
dealing
with
counsel
fees,
but
that
was
not
the
touchstone
of
the
board’s
decision.
the
touchstone
of
the
board’s
decision
is
set
forth
on
page
38
(a)
was
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
the
statutory
standard
for
determining
remedies.
it
was
not
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
to
give
this
extraordinary
remedy
in
addition
to
the
remedies
already
given.
now,
when
the
board
came
to
the
tiidee
case,
the
tiidee
case
was
a
very
special
case.
there
what
you
had
was
frivolous
litigation.
let
me
just
indicate
in
a
minute
or
so
exactly
what
happened
in
tiidee
because
i
think
that
puts
the
frivolous
aspect
of
the
litigation
in
context.
in
tiidee,
the
employer
had
agreed
to
have
a
consent
election.
he
was
not
fighting
the
election,
he
had
a
consent
election
and
he
agreed
to
abide
by
the
results
of
the
election.
then
after
the
union
had
won
the
election
overwhelmingly
by
a
vote
of
19
to
6,
the
employer
refused
to
abide
by
the
election
saying
that
the
regional
director
in
approving
the
election
had
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
and
that
in
addition
to
that,
the
regional
director
had
denied
due
process
of
law.
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
that
as
a
frivolous
contention
forcing
the
union
to
litigate,
they
said
that
was
frivolous
litigation.
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
tiidee
case
to
the
board
and
when
the
board
got
back
the
tiidee
case
it
looked
at
it
and
said,
"yes"
where
there’s
frivolous
litigation,
there’s
a
strong
public
interest
in
not
permitting
such
litigation
to
clog
the
board’s
processes
and
the
court’s
processes.
that’s
frivolous
litigation,
but
there’s
a
great
distinction
and
a
valid
one
which
we
think
the
board
was
justified
in
drawing
between
frivolous
litigation,
where
there's
no
basis
at
all
for
the
claim
made
and
litigation
which
is
conducted
with
an
arguable
case
even
though
ultimately,
ultimately
the
party
asserting
the
defense
loses,
that’s
a
very
different
thing.
the
policy
considerations
that
justify
and
led
the
board
to
conclude
that
an
exception
should
be
made
in
the
case
of
frivolous
litigation,
do
not
carry
over
we
believe
to
litigation
conducted
in
good
faith
even
though
the
company
loses
and
even
though
that
was
a
persistent
violator.
and
we
believe
that
the
board
acted
well
within
its
discretion
in
declining
to
extend
the
general
rule
that
it
had
announced
in
this
case,
in
heck’s
beyond
the
limited
exception
for
frivolous
litigation.
and
we
therefore
think
the
court
of
appeals,
misinterpreted
what
the
board
had
done
and
that
really
the
court
of
appeals
itself
was
attempting
to
decide
what
it
believed
the
effectuation
of
the
policies
of
the
act
required
and
that
we
submit
is
not
the
proper
function
of
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
to
the
court.
in
a
large
number
of
cases,
this
court
has
recognized
the
limited
role
that
courts
of
appeals
have
in
reviewing
the
scope
of
remedial
orders
of
administrative
agencies.
the
standard
governing
such
review
has
been
formulated
in
different
ways,
but
there
the
court
had
said
it
before
the
appellate
court
attempts
to
change
the
remedy,
it
must
find
that
the
remedy
selected
has
no
reasonable
relation
to
the
unlawful
practices
found
that
it
constitute
a
patent
abuse
of
discretion
albeit
the
agency
has
not
made
an
allowable
choose
of
remedy.
now
this
principle
has
also
been
applied
to
orders
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
this
court
having
recently
stated
in
gissel
case
that
those
orders
are
entitled
to
special
respect.
all
of
those
cases
have
been
ones
in
which
the
remedy
provided
by
the
agency
has
been
challenge
because
it
assertedly
went
too
far.
the
agency
did
something
more
either
that
was
permitted
to
do
under
to
the
statute
or
that
was
claimed
as
necessary
to
deal
with
the
problem
before
the
agency.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
failed
to
go
as
far
as
it
should
have
gone
in
providing
appropriate
remedies.
specifically,
because
the
board
failed
to
grant
a
union
request
that
in
addition
to
a
number
of
other
remedies
that
the
board
had
provided,
it
did
not
require
the
employer
to
reimburse
the
union
for
counsel
fees
expended
and
extraordinary
organizational
expenses
it
had.
in
connection
with
an
organizing
drive
result
where
the
employer
had
committed
serious
unfair
labor
practices
against
it.
we
have
brought
the
case
to
this
court
because
we
think
that
the
standard
governing
the
proper
scope
of
judicial
review
of
agency
orders
should
be
the
same
and
must
be
the
same
whether
the
order
is
challenged
as
excessive
or
inadequate.
and
indeed,
as
i
understand
the
union
has
no
disagreement
with
us.
the
union
said,
“yes,
the
standard
is
the
same,
but
under
standard
the
board
acted
improperly.”
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
may
i
address
that
right
now.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
let
me
--
i
think
it
will
be
a
convenient
point
to
address
it
right
now.
heck’s
was
a
party
of
course
before
the
board
and
all
of
the
proceedings.
on
the
cases
before
the
court
of
appeals
the
first
time,
heck’s
intervened
that
it
has
a
right
as
it
had
a
right
to
do.
when
the
case
came
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
second
time
heck’s
did
not
intervene
although
it
had
a
right
to
do
so,
and
a
case
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
assumption
by
the
both
the
board
and
the
union
that
the
board
had
this
authority.
heck’s
could
have
intervened
but
didn’t.
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
assumed
the
board
had
this
authority
but
held
that
the
board
have
failed
to
exercise
it.
it
was
only
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
to
provide
these
remedies
that
heck’s
then
sought
to
intervene
before
the
court
of
appeals.
that
was
denied
by
the
court
presumably
as
untimely
because
under
the
rules
and
application
for
intervention
it's
required
to
file
within
30
days
of
filing
a
petition
to
review.
heck’s
then
sought
review
in
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
but
denial
of
intervention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
denial
of
intervention,
that
was
denied,
that
was
denied.
following
that,
heck’s
was
permitted
to
intervene
by
the
court
of
appeals
approximately
six
weeks
after
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
was
filed.
now,
we
have
filed
a
supplemental
memorandum
in
this
case.
it’s
a
xerox
document
that
we
were
unable
to
file
unfortunately
until
last
friday
in
which
we
discussed
this
problem
at
considerable
length.
we
say,
suggest
to
the
court
is
first
of
all,
we
think
it
is
very
dubious;
whether
after
this
court
has
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
court
of
appeals
can
then
grant
intervention
so
as
to
permit
someone
to
become
a
party
in
the
proceeding
to
this
court.
we
think
when
this
court
has
taken
the
case
that
at
least
ousts
the
court
of
appeals
of
authority
to
make
then
someone
a
party.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
did
not.
they
did
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
after
initially
denying
and
i
found
that
also
that
this
court,
and
they
denied
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court,
but
we
don’t
know
why.
now
this
issue
was
never
been
raised
because
this
court.
it’s
not
raise
by
the
board.
it
is
not
raise
by
union.
the
union
concedes
it
and
i’m
not
sure
exactly
what
status
the
employer
believes
it
has
in
this
case.
on
the
one
hand,
it
has
now
amended
the
caption
to
show
itself
as
the
respondent,
on
the
other
hand,
at
page
2
of
its
brief,
it
asked
leave
to
intervene.
the
court
of
appeals
--
this
court
incidentally
had
denied
a
petition
for
rehearing
of
that
in
march
i
believe
--
early
this
month
and
it
just
seems
to
us
this
issue
was
not
properly
presented.
this
is
not
the
way
in
which
this
kind
of
a
question
should
be
(inaudible).
the
very
question
--
the
very
question
that
the
employer
seeks
to
raise
in
this
case
is
now
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
tiidee
case
to
which
i
shall
refer,
that
case
was
argued
in
september
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
the
same
court
that
decided
this
case
in
which
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
board’s
authority
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
board’s
power
to
do.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
think
the
board
has
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
we
think
the
board
has
that
power
and
the
union
of
course
agrees
with
us.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it’s
not.
it’s
not
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
stand
corrected
mr.
justice.
it
is
a
claim.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
not
at
issue
as
far
as
the
parties
are
concerned.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
suggestion
by
the
employer
is
that
it's
somehow
anomalous
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
the
board
in
this
case
properly
refused
to
award
the
fees
if
in
fact
as
they
claim,
it
has
no
authority
at
all.
we
have
cited
signed
it
our
supplemental
memorandum,
a
decision
of
this
court,
two
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
think
are
very
close.
some
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
a
private
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
recover
for
violation
of
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
without
deciding
whether
or
not
such
as
suit
would
lie.
about
three
to
four
years
later,
the
question
came
up
and
this
court
then
held
in
the
national
mill
case
that
in
fact
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
not
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
for
which
a
private
action
would
lie.
so
it
seems
to
us
this
is
a
case
in
which
this
contention
that
the
employer
has
made
is
not
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
no
means
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justices.
i
don’t
see
how
our
questions
could
possibly
be
viewed
as
raising
any
issue
with
respect
to
the
board’s
power.
it’s
a
strange
thing.
what
the
employer
is
doing
is
urging
an
alternative
ground
not
for
affirmance,
but
for
reversal,
a
ground
that
the
parties
have
not
raised
and
that
as
far
as
we’re
concerned
is
not
--
this
is
it
seems
to
us
is
not
the
proper
context
and
posture
in
which
to
litigate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
union
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we
have
not
joined
in
the
motion
mr.
justice,
but
what
we
have
said,
we
spent
two
or
three
pages
in
this
supplemental
memorandum
suggesting
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
it’s
--
unfortunately
it's
not
printed
at
the
moment,
but
we
hope
it
will
be
printed
by
the
end
of
the
week.
it’s
being
printed
now,
but
we
filed
it
because
of
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
done
nothing
with
respect
to
that
motion.
we
have
filed
a
memorandum
or
brief
in
answer
to
the
union’s
brief
because
we
don’t
know
how
the
court
is
going
to
treat
it,
i’m
sorry,
the
employer’s
brief,
we
don’t
know
how
the
court
is
going
to
treat
it,
but
we
give
a
number
of
reasons
as
to
why
we
don’t
think
the
court
should
consider
the
argument
and
then
very
briefly
just
indicate
our
view
as
to
why
we
i
think
the
board
has
that
power
in
rather
summary
fashion
because
we
got
much
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
much
mr.
justice.
it
would
seem
to
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
isn’t.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don’t
think
that
issue
is
probably
before
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
filed
mr.
justice.
they
at
the
same
time
that
the
court
granted
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari,
it
denied
heck’s
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
denial
of
intervention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
our
position.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
the
court
mr.
justice
this
morning
denied
leave
to
file.
the
court
denied
leave
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
it
physically
with
you,
but
we
believe
that
in
the
light
of
the
court’s
action
that
is
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
now,
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
sorry.
i
apologize.
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
it
was
denying
the
order
the
leave
to
the
chamber
of
commerce
to
follow
brief
in
support
of
that
about
the
heck’s
brief
is
before
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there’s
a
motion
to
strike
it
made
by
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
that
is
before
the
court,
the
motion.
the
motion
to
strike
or
apart
from
the
motion
to
strike
whether
the
court
will
consider
the
merits
of
that.
i
mean,
the
court
could
have
of
course
keep
the
motion,
the
brief
on
file,
but
declined
as
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
the
union’s
motion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we’re
not
joining
it
as
such.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
[laughter]i
don’t
know
mr.
justice.
it
seems
to
me
your
question
indicates
the
reason
for
the
rule
that
a
party
has
to
seek
timely
intervention
before
the
court
of
appeals.
heck’s
could
have
protected
itself
completely
in
this
case
had
it
sort
timely
intervention
before
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
let
me
if
i
may
get
to
the
basic
issue
in
the
case
as
i
said
there’s
no
dispute
over
the
fact
of
the
standard
is
the
same,
and
therefore,
the
case
comes
down
to
as
whether
in
the
facts
of
this
case
the
board
abused
its
discretion,
did
something
that
was
patently
irrational
or
illegal
in
declining
the
union,
the
additional
remedies
which
it
had
here
sought.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes.
we
agree
the
employer
and
the
board
are
in
agreement
that
the
board
properly
declined
these
additional
remedies.
we
disagree
with
heck’s.
we
think
we
have
the
power
to
grant
those
remedies,
heck’s
says
we
do
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
review
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice,
but
in
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals
it
seems
to
me
it
has
to
look
at
the
limited
role
the
court
of
appeals
place
in
this
thing
that
is
whether
in
all
of
the
circumstances,
whether
in
all
of
the
circumstances,
it
can
be
said
that
the
board
patently
abused
its
discretion.
that
it’s
conclusion
here
that
these
additional
remedies
were
not
necessary
or
no
relation
to
its
permissible
views
as
to
what
the
act
requires.
now,
unfortunately
it
will
need
a
somewhat
detailed
discussion
of
the
facts
because
this
board
decision
here
is
involved
with
the
board
subsequent
decision
in
the
tiidee
case
and
since
the
court
of
appeals
held
not
that
the
board
had
improperly
exercised
its
discretion
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
the
board’s
rationale
in
this
case
was
insufficient.
that
was
not
the
theory
on
which
it
held
the
board
was
required
to
give
these
remedies.
the
theory
was
that
what
the
board
had
done
in
the
tiidee
case.
somehow
undermined
its
decision
here.
so
in
my
presentation,
i
will
focus
mainly
on
what
the
board
did
in
this
case,
what
the
board
did
in
the
tiidee
case.
the
case
arose
out
of
an
attempt
by
the
union
to
organize
a
retail
store
operated
by
heck’s
in
clarksburg,
west
virginia.
heck’s
as
is
customarily
for
it,
strongly
resisted
the
union
and
engaged
in
a
variety
of
unfair
labor
practices.
i
use
the
word
“customarily”
because
heck’s
is
not
stranger
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
the
past
few
years,
it
has
been
a
respondent
in
11
different
proceedings.
and
the
board
found
in
this
case
that
this
was
part
of
a
general
plan
by
heck’s,
conducted
by
its
two
principle
officers,
it's
president
and
vice
president
to
resist
unionization
at
every
stage
and
it
is
said
to
deny
its
employees
their
rights
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
what
the
heck’s
did
is
to
cause
customarily
ring
to
it.
they
threatened
and
coerced
employees
who
were
active
in
the
union.
they
conducted
a
non-secret
poll
of
the
employees
as
to
who
is
interested
in
the
union.
they
threatened
that
if
the
union
got
in,
they’d
close
the
store
and
then
they
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union,
even
though
as
the
board
found
the
union
enjoyed
a
representation
status
with
respect
to
a
majority
of
the
employees.
the
union
had
obtained
cards,
authorization
cards
and
that
was
basis
on
which
it
sought
to
bargain
with
the
company.
now,
this
is
of
some
significance
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
case
we
have
here.
heck’s
asserted
that
it
had
a
good
faith
doubt
with
respect
to
whether
in
fact
the
union
represented
a
majority
of
its
employees
and
the
examiner
agreed
with
heck’s
on
this.
the
examiner
said
yes
on
all
the
facts
we
think
heck’s
did
have
a
good
faith
doubt,
the
board
however
reject
that.
as
a
remedy
for
these
unfair
labor
practices,
the
board
adopted
what
is
its
conventional
remedy.
it
entered
a
cease
and
desist
order.
it
directed
the
employer
depose
to
various
notices
in
its
plant
and
it
also
directed
the
employer
on
request
to
bargain
with
the
union
finding
that
the
employer’s
unfair
labor
practices
had
made
it
impossible
at
that
point
to
hold
a
fair
election.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
board’s
findings
of
violation
and
said
that
the
board’s
order
was
fine
as
far
as
it
went,
but
that
it
didn’t
go
far
enough,
and
therefore,
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
a
court
of
appeals
tiidee’s
opinion.
now,
on
the
remand,
the
board
granted
some,
but
not
all
of
the
remedies
that
the
union
had
sought.
specifically,
it
added
these
remedies.
it
required
the
employer
to
mail
this
notice
which
had
previously
ordered
posted
in
the
plants
to
every
employee
at
his
or
her
home.
it
directed
the
employer
to
give
the
union
access
to
company
bulletin
boards
for
a
period
of
the
year
and
it
also
directed
the
employer
to
make
available
to
the
union
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
the
employees
and
to
keep
list
current
for
a
year
to
facilitate
the
union’s
communication
with
its
employees.
the
board,
however,
refused
to
grant
certain
other
requests
that
the
union
had
made.
it
refused
to
grant
an
order
for
company
wide
bargaining.
it
refused
to
order
the
employer
to
read
the
notices
to
the
employees
at
an
assemblage
and
it
declined
to
award
attorney’s
fees
and
excess
organizational
expenditures.
the
board
recognized
there
was
a
probability
that
as
a
result
of
the
employer’s
unfair
labor
practices,
the
union
probably
spent
more
on
attorney’s
fees
and
organizational
fees
that
it
would
have
found
had
there
not
been
the
refusal
to
bargain.
but,
the
board
concluded
and
this
is
on
page
38
(a)
of
the
petition,
said
it
wouldn’t
unbalance,
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
to
require
reimbursement
by
the
employer
with
respect
to
these
items.
now,
when
the
board
spoke
of
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
act,
it
was
referring
to
the
statutory
provision
governing
the
board’s
authority
over
order.
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
which
gives
the
board
power
to
take
such
affirmative
action,
including
reinstatement
of
employees
with
or
without
backpay
as
will
effectuate
the
purpose,
the
policies
of
the
act.
the
basic
rationale
of
the
board’s
decision
in
this
case
was
that
the
special
role
of
a
charging
party
before
the
board,
the
group,
the
person
who
files
the
charges,
that
the
role
of
the
charging
party
was
such
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
carry
out
the
policies
of
the
act
as
a
general
rule
to
provide
for
attorney’s
fees
and
expert
organizational
expenses.
as
the
board
said,
i’m
reading
now
briefly
from
in
page
39
(a),
“it
is
the
board
which
has
been
given
primary
initial
responsibility
to
determine
and
protect
the
public
interest
in
the
elimination
of
obstructions
to
commerce
resulting
from
labor
disputes.
such
protection
of
the
public
interest
as
may
result
from
the
charging
parties
participation
in
litigation
must
be
regarded,
we
believe,
as
incidental
to
its
efforts
to
protect
its
own
private
interest.
given
this
statutory
framework,
we
conclude
that
the
public
interest
in
allowing
the
charging
party
to
recover,
the
cost
of
its
participation
in
this
litigation
does
not
override
the
general
and
well-established
principle
that
litigation
expenses
are
ordinarily
not
recovered.
well,
now,
the
union
disagrees
with
us
what
the
general
principle
is
with
respect
to
the
recoverability
of
litigation
expenses
in
this
country.
we
have
filed
a
brief.
we
argue
it
one
way.
the
union
on
argues
it
the
other.
not
infrequently
lawyers
disagree
as
to
what
the
cases
hold,
but
the
critical
thing,
we
think
about
this
is
this
was
just
really
an
additional
ground
the
board
relied
on.
the
clinical
language
we
think
is
the
language
on
page
38
that
on
balance
because
of
the
role
of
the
charging
party,
it
would
not
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
to
permit
reimbursement.
now,
i
just
might
mention
parenthetically
in
passing
since
this
is
important.
under
the
board’s
procedures,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
schofield
case,
it’s
the
board
that
has
the
laboring
oar
in
conducting
its
proceedings.
the
charging
party
has
a
party.
the
charging
party
can
may
play
a
greater
or
lesser
role,
but
it’s
the
board
that
conducts
the
proceedings.
it’s
the
board
for
example
that
makes
the
decision
whether
to
seek
enforcement
of
an
order.
the
charging
party
cannot
do
that.
it
is
the
board
that
has
the
sole
authority
to
cite
a
respondent
for
contempt
if
he
fails
to
comply
with
the
order.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
case
is
a
very
different
case
from
the
typical
situation
in
which
attorney’s
fees
have
been
awarded.
this
is
a
not
case
in
which
attorney’s
fees
have
to
be
awarded
in
order
to
encourage
people
to
conduct
litigation
where
that
litigation
is
an
important
element
of
implementing
the
statutory
programs
and
policies.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
as
result
of
a
litigant’s
activities,
benefit
has
been
conferred
upon
a
group
and
it’s
deemed
unfair
that
the
members
of
that
group
should
not
compensate
the
man
who
brought
the
suit.
i
mean,
in
the
case
in
the
woods
case,
the
case
last
year
under
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
in
the
cole
case
there
what
you
had
was
the
particular
employee
had
brought
a
suit
in
order
to
vindicate
his
right
to
a
free
speech
in
opposition
to
the
union.
the
court
held
that
attorney’s
fees
were
properly
paled
by
the
union
in
that
case
because
in
vindicating
his
right
of
free
speech,
he
was
also
vindicating
the
rights
of
free
speech
of
all
the
members
of
union
and
therefore
that
all
the
members
of
the
union
benefited
from
his
endeavors.
now
here,
obviously
all
the
members
of
the
union
benefited
from
the
union’s
activities,
but
it’s
the
members
of
the
union
who
should
pay
for
that.
certainly,
the
employer
in
this
case
cannot
be
deemed
the
beneficiary
of
a
litigation
the
union
conducted
in
this
case.
the
union
and
the
employer
were
at
odds.
now,
when
the
case
came
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
second
time,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
as
i’ve
indicated
in
any
way
that
it
disagreed
with
the
board’s
general
premise
that
ordinarily
because
of
the
nature
of
broad
proceedings
that
counsel
fees
and
organizational
expenses
should
not
be
awarded.
what
it
said
was
it
thought
the
board’s
rationale
in
this
case
had
been
undercut
by
it’s
decision
in
tiidee
case
and
that
the
board
now
in
effect
has
conceded
that
as
long
as
an
employer,
let
me
read
the
precise
language
the
court
of
appeals
used
because
i
think
it
indicates
the
essence
of
it’s
holding
in
this
case.
the
court
said
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
reading
from
page
10
(a)
of
the
first
appendix
to
the
petition.
unfortunately,
in
this
case
the
various
documents
divided
up
in
--
among
a
number
of
different
places.
what
the
court
said
is
a
bottom
of
the
--
just
before
the
paragraph
number
2
on
10
(a).
it
was
said
it
would
appear
that
board
is
now
recognized
that
employers
will
follow
a
pattern
of
resisting
union
organization
and
who
to
that
end
unduly
burden
the
processes
of
the
board
and
the
courts
should
be
oblige
at
the
very
least
to
respond
in
terms
of
making
good
the
legal
expenses
to
which
they
have
put
the
charging
parties
and
the
board.
we
hold
that
the
case
before
us
is
an
appropriate
one
for
according
such
relief.
we
think
in
this,
in
this
holding
the
board
has
completely
misinterpreted
the
board’s
decision
in
tiidee.
tiidee
was
another
case
similar
to
this
one;
an
employer
who
resisted
union
organization
demands,
who
refused
to
bargain
the
board
entered
the
conventional
remedies.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
primarily
to
consider
what
was
called
a
“make-whole”
remedy.
that
is
the
claim
of
the
union
that
relief
should
include
not
only
cease
and
desist,
etcetera,
etcetera,
but
also
to
pay
to
the
employees
the
amounts
the
board
thinks
they
would
have
gotten
had
there
been
a
contract.
that
was
the
main
issue
that
was
litigated
in
the
tiidee
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
could
see
them
mr.
justice.
yes,
the
tiidee
panel
where
judges
leventhal,
robinson
and
mcgowan,
this
panel
were
judges
leventhal,
bazelon,
and
mcgowan
and
judge
mcgowan
wrote
the
opinion.
now,
in
the
tiidee
case
after
this
lengthy
discussion,
the
court
almost
at
the
end
its
opinion
added
a
footnote.
i’m
sorry,
the
end
of
the
discussion
in
the
tiidee
opinion.
it
said
that
the
board
should
reconsider
on
the
remand,
other
lesser
remedies
beside
the
make-whole
and
one
of
the
things
it
said
to
consider
ultimate
remedies
such
as
an
award
to
the
union
for
excess
organization
costs,
caused
by
the
company’s
behavior,
or
for
the
cost
of
having
to
litigate
a
frivolous
case,
the
court’s
words,
frivolous
case
or
for
a
combination
of
this.
and
earlier
in
its
opinion
at
page
1249
at
426
f.2nd,
the
court
said,
“the
present
posture
of
the
board
encourages
frivolous
litigation
not
only
before
the
board
but
before
courts.”
that
is
the
present
posture
of
the
board
in
not
doing
anything
more
than
the
conventional
remedies.
in
its
tiidee
opinion,
the
board
specifically
granted
attorney’s
fees
because
this
was
frivolous
litigation
that
was
said.
to
refer
to
page
35
and
page
36
of
the
appendix,
the
brown
volume,
the
board
said
that
it
had
previously,
as
recently
noted,
normally
litigation
expenses
are
not
recoverable
by
the
charging
party
in
board
proceedings
even
though
the
public
interest
is
served
from
the
charging
party
protects
its
private
interest
before
the
board,
citing
its
decision
in
this
very
case.
and
it
went
on
to
say,
we
agree
with
the
court,
however,
the
frivolous
litigation
such
as
this
is
unwarranted.
but
then
it
went
on
to
say
the
statutory
policy
of
ensuring
rights
of
the
employees
is
encouraged
and
if
its
not
encouraged
further
when
this
frivolous
litigation.
and
it
said,
“in
order
discourage
frivolous
litigation,
future
frivolous
litigation,
page
36
of
the
appendix
and
to
serve
the
policies
of
the
act
we
decided
to
award
it.
three
times
in
its
discussion
at
pages
35-36
of
the
appendix
in
its
tiidee
opinion,
it
refers
to
frivolous
litigation.
when
it
came
to
access
organizational
expenses,
what
the
board
said
was
we're
not
going
to
award
them
because
as
we
view
this
case,
there
were
no
access
organizational
expenses.
the
union
in
two
months
won
in
election
19
to
6
and
it
didn’t
incur
any
excess
organizational
expenditures.
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
that
ruling
as
somehow
indicating
that
the
board
had
abandoned
its
rationale
in
heck’s.
somehow
because
the
board
had
not
said
in
the
heck’s
case,
i’m
sorry,
because
the
board
had
not
said
in
tiidee
case
while
we
have
--
while
we
generally
don’t
award
these
things,
we
don’t
have
reach
the
case
to
see
whether
it’s
an
exception
here,
whether
it’s
frivolous
litigation
because
in
this
situation
there
was
no
excess
expenditures
obtained.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
there
are
two
basic
points
i’d
like
to
make
about
what
the
board
did
in
this
case.
first,
we
think
the
board
was
preeminently
reasonable
in
light
of
the
statutory
scheme
in
concluding
that
as
a
general
rule,
attorney’s
fees
and
litigation
expenses
should
not
be
accorded
as
a
part
of
the
remedy
for
unfair
labor
practices.
that
we
think
is
the
general
rule
if
properly
promulgated.
we
also
think
it
acted
reasonably
in
creating
the
exception
it
did
in
tiidee
for
frivolous
litigation.
frivolous
litigation
stands
on
a
very
different
footing
from
litigation
in
which
although
there
are
substantial
questions
to
be
litigated,
nevertheless
ultimately
it’s
held
that
the
defendant
has
not
prevailed.
in
this
case,
in
this
case
although
the
board
found
that
the
employer
had
no
good
faith
doubt
about
the
union’s
--
the
employer
had
no
good
faith
doubt
about
the
union’s
majority
status,
the
employer
--
the
union
--
the
employee’s
contention
had
sufficient
substance
that
the
trial
examiner
went
the
other
way.
we
think
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
really
done
is
it
has
attempted
to
determine
what
in
fact
would
be
appropriate
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
what
would
be
appropriate
relief
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
that
is
a
decision
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
congress
has
committed
to
the
expert
opinion
of
the
board
and
not
to
the
courts
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
went
beyond
the
proper
scope
of
its
relief.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
just
really
one
or
two
related
points
i’d
like
to
make.
i
think
in
considering
the
propriety
of
what
the
board
did
in
this
case,
it’s
important
to
recognize
that
the
board
did
not
just
focus
on
whether
or
not
to
award
counsel
fees
and
organizational
expenses.
in
addition
to
the
normal
remedies
that
the
board
usually
provides
in
this
type
of
case,
the
board
provided
additional
remedies
here
on
the
remand
as
a
result
of
its
evaluation
of
the
employer’s
conduct.
that
is
in
addition
to
the
normal
cease
and
desist
order
in
the
posting
of
notices
here
in
order
to
aid
the
union,
the
board
required
that
the
employer
send
the
notices
out
to
each
employee
at
his
home,
required
that
the
employer
give
the
union
access
to
company
bulletin
boards
for
a
year
and
required
that
the
employer
finally
give
the
union
a
list
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
employees,
so
that
the
union
would
be
able
to
make
contact
more
easily
with
the
employees.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
those
remedies
would,
given
it
did
not
feel
as
a
general
rule,
it
should
give
the
additional
remedy
of
organizational
expenses
and
counsel
fees
because
in
the
light
of
the
nature
of
the
charging
party’s
limited
role,
this
case
was
not
one
in
which
that
additional
remedy,
in
addition
to
what
the
board
had
already
given,
was
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
now
the
board
did
refer
to
the
american
rule,
the
general
rule
that
ordinarily
in
the
absence
of
statute
or
contract,
attorney’s
fees
are
not
awarded
and
that
is
a
rule
which
this
court
has
recognized,
including
the
two
most
recent
cases
dealing
with
counsel
fees,
but
that
was
not
the
touchstone
of
the
board’s
decision.
the
touchstone
of
the
board’s
decision
is
set
forth
on
page
38
(a)
was
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
the
statutory
standard
for
determining
remedies.
it
was
not
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
to
give
this
extraordinary
remedy
in
addition
to
the
remedies
already
given.
now,
when
the
board
came
to
the
tiidee
case,
the
tiidee
case
was
a
very
special
case.
there
what
you
had
was
frivolous
litigation.
let
me
just
indicate
in
a
minute
or
so
exactly
what
happened
in
tiidee
because
i
think
that
puts
the
frivolous
aspect
of
the
litigation
in
context.
in
tiidee,
the
employer
had
agreed
to
have
a
consent
election.
he
was
not
fighting
the
election,
he
had
a
consent
election
and
he
agreed
to
abide
by
the
results
of
the
election.
then
after
the
union
had
won
the
election
overwhelmingly
by
a
vote
of
19
to
6,
the
employer
refused
to
abide
by
the
election
saying
that
the
regional
director
in
approving
the
election
had
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
and
that
in
addition
to
that,
the
regional
director
had
denied
due
process
of
law.
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
that
as
a
frivolous
contention
forcing
the
union
to
litigate,
they
said
that
was
frivolous
litigation.
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
tiidee
case
to
the
board
and
when
the
board
got
back
the
tiidee
case
it
looked
at
it
and
said,
"yes"
where
there’s
frivolous
litigation,
there’s
a
strong
public
interest
in
not
permitting
such
litigation
to
clog
the
board’s
processes
and
the
court’s
processes.
that’s
frivolous
litigation,
but
there’s
a
great
distinction
and
a
valid
one
which
we
think
the
board
was
justified
in
drawing
between
frivolous
litigation,
where
there's
no
basis
at
all
for
the
claim
made
and
litigation
which
is
conducted
with
an
arguable
case
even
though
ultimately,
ultimately
the
party
asserting
the
defense
loses,
that’s
a
very
different
thing.
the
policy
considerations
that
justify
and
led
the
board
to
conclude
that
an
exception
should
be
made
in
the
case
of
frivolous
litigation,
do
not
carry
over
we
believe
to
litigation
conducted
in
good
faith
even
though
the
company
loses
and
even
though
that
was
a
persistent
violator.
and
we
believe
that
the
board
acted
well
within
its
discretion
in
declining
to
extend
the
general
rule
that
it
had
announced
in
this
case,
in
heck’s
beyond
the
limited
exception
for
frivolous
litigation.
and
we
therefore
think
the
court
of
appeals,
misinterpreted
what
the
board
had
done
and
that
really
the
court
of
appeals
itself
was
attempting
to
decide
what
it
believed
the
effectuation
of
the
policies
of
the
act
required
and
that
we
submit
is
not
the
proper
function
of
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
