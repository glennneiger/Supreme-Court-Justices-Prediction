mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
in
our
view,
two
rather
separate
questions.
one
is
to
validity
of
the
court's
holding
that
the
board
acted
arbitrarily
in
not
awarding
organizational
expenses
in
this
case
and
the
second
is
that
the
board
acted
arbitrarily
in
refusing
to
award
legal
fees
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
here
contrary
to
my
friend
mr.
friedman’s
setting
of
the
question
about
what
the
board
should
hold
as
a
general
rule
with
respect
to
legal
fees.
at
least
if
as
a
general
rule
is
meant
to
cover
cases
where
you
do
not
have
a
persistent
aggravated
offender,
one
whose
unfair
labor
practices
are
brazen
and
who
is
in
fact
a
multiple
recidivist.
the
law
has
ways
of
taking
care
of
treating
litigants
of
that
violators
of
that
kind.
it
is
the
same
way
as
it
turns
out
to
the
fields
with
litigants
who
present
frivolous
defenses.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
principle
has
no
application
in
this
case
where
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
did
was
to
hold
that
the
board
had
acted
arbitrarily,
unreasonably,
and
drawn
a
distinction
where
there
is
no
material
difference
in
results,
in
relevant
results
between
what
they
said
about
the
benefits
of
organizational
expenses
to
effectuation
of
the
policies
of
the
act
in
tiidee
and
what
they
said
as
the
board
as
their
reasons
for
organization
expenses
in
tiidee
none
of
which
board
remotely
on
the
organizational
expenses
related
solely
to
the
counsel
fees.
i
mean,
that
it
heck’s,
the
reasons
given
in
heck’s
for
the
denial
of
counsel
fees
were
the
same
as
the
reason
given
for
the
denial
of
organizational
expenses.
they’re
relevant
on
the
question
of
counsel
fees.
they
are
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
organizational
expenses
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
held
and
whether
the
board
was
being
arbitrarily,
when
it
distinguished
aggravated
and
persistent
violators
from
those
who
present
frivolous
defenses
even
others
may
not
be
even
as
brazen
violations
as
the
law
of
the
persistent
recidivist.
now,
we
think
that
unless
the
scope
of
judicial
review
afforded
by
the
administer
procedure
act
is
to
be
narrowed
beyond
toleration
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
allowed
at
least
to
set
aside
administrative
inaction
or
action
when
it
correctly
finds
that
the
action
or
in
action
is
arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
i
have
used
that
term,
which
means
irrational,
not
materially
related
and
supported
by
the
reasoning
given
and
distinctions
without
relevant
differences.
this
is,
i
submit
your
honor
what
the
test
should
be
in
this
case.
did
the
court
of
appeals
--
was
the
court
of
appeals
correct
in
holding
that
the
board
in
effect
was
arbitrary
here.
now
there
are
two
respects
in
which
this
case
is
unique.
one,
it
is
a
case
of
a
multiple
recidivist
whose
brazen
violations
in
the
board’s
own
words
are
company
wide
aggravated
and
pervasive.
the
board
found
that
heck’s
had
a
policy,
a
labor
policy
which
was
opposed
to
policies
of
the
act,
and
as
a
result
of
that
policy,
within
a
relatively
short
time,
between
1965
and
1970,
heck’s
was
involved
in
unfair
practice
litigation
11
times.
during
that
period
as
it
happened,
the
court
of
appeals
for
fourth
circuit
was
holding
that
the
board
couldn’t
get
a
bargain
order
on
authorization
cards.
and
it
was
only
when
that
was
--
it
was
in
that
light
of
that
holding
that
the
board
and
the
trial
examiner
treated
one
or
two
of
these
heck’s
violation
cases.
one
or
two
other
cases
actually
came
to
this
court
in
gissel
as
a
companion
case
and
of
course
the
judgment
below
was
reversed.
now,
heck’s
strategy
was
–-
oh,
i
just
wanted
to
add
that
the
reason
the
board
reversed
the
trial
examiner's
determination
that
there
was
no
refusal
to
bargain
in
bad
faith
was
not
because
it
differed
with
him
on
the
facts,
but
on
it
--
because
its
view
that
heck’s
was
totally
unconcerned
with
whether
the
union
had
a
majority
or
not.
it
wouldn’t
have
bargained
no
matter
what
the
situation
was
because
of
its
background
and
history
of
persistent
unfair
labor
practices,
it
would
have
refused
to
bargain
in
any
event.
it’s
simply
demanded
an
election
to
gain
additional
time
to
undermine
the
union
and
when
it
had
done
that
of
course
it
fought
with
it,
litigation.
now,
the
strategy
that
heck’s
used
was
to
transfer,
discharge
or
close
its
door
or
threaten
to
do
those
things
if
the
union
got
in
to
engage
in
excessive
interrogation,
coercive
interviews
and
illegal
polls.
when
the
union
requested
recognition,
heck’s
would
step
up
its
campaign.
it
routinely
refused
to
look
at
authorization
cards
that
union
tendered
in
support
of
its
request.
it
demanded
an
election
to
gain
time
within
which
to
undermine
the
union
further
and
thereby
forced
the
union
and
the
general
counsel
to
litigate,
to
establish
that
union
had
an
un-coerced
majority
when
it
have
requested
recognition.
now,
the
board
treats
frivolous
litigation
as
if
somehow
the
litigation
had
been
initiated
by
the
employer.
that’s
not
true.
of
course,
the
employers
have
responded
in
this
case.
the
real
way
to
see
that,
the
only
way
to
see
that
is
to
see
that
the
employer
is
willing
to
submit
to
litigation
even
though
he
has
gotten
a
plausible
defense
or
no
matter
how
brazen
his
violations
are
in
the
hope
like
mr.
mccoben
that
something
will
turn
up.
and
if
he
is
able
to
attack
the
union’s
card
showing,
well,
that’s
let
him
free
of
the
hook
because
if
he
has
--
union
hasn’t
got
a
valid
majority
of
un-coerced
cards,
it
doesn’t
have
a
right,
but
that
isn’t
why
he
acted
illegally.
all
of
his
illegal
action
was
devoted
to
destroying
the
support
for
the
union
whether
or
not
they
have
a
majority.
so
what
really
is
happening
here
is
that
employer
is
using,
he
is
provoking
the
litigation.
he
is
provoking
the
union
and
compelling
it
to
resort
to
litigation,
it
and
the
board
to
resort
to
litigation
and
then
he
goes
along,
hopes
he
wins,
he
doesn’t
care
how
long
it
takes
in
effect
for
long
as
long
possible
to
ward
off
the
evil
bad.
and
then
when
the
evil
day
arrives
probably
finds
the
union
totally
impotent
to
engage
in
bargain.
the
board
has
recognized
all
that.
in
its
decision
in
tiidee,
its
supplemental
opinion
in
tiidee
following
the
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals,
the
board
had
this
to
say,
and
oh
yes
before
i
get
to
that
i
should
mention
that
when
mr.
friedman
says
that
the
board’s
decision
--
the
court’s
decision
in
tiidee
related
only
to
frivolous
litigation.
he
omits
the
fact
that
the
remand
in
the
heck’s
itself
was
predicated
not
on
the
frivolity
of
the
defense,
but
on
the
persistent
and
aggravated
bad
faith
conduct
which
the
board
itself
had
found.
so
there
can
be
no
justification
whatever
for
claiming
that
the
board
was
--
could
properly
have
believed
that
all
the
court
of
appeals
meant
was
it
should
award
counsel
fees
in
cases
of
frivolous
litigation
and
not
where
they’re
aggravated
and
persistent
violations
as
where
in
heck’s.
that
distinction
just
simply
blown
out
on
the
basis
of
the
heck’s
remand
itself.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
board
accepts
the
remand
in
the
heck’s
case.
as
we
understand
it
that
means
that
they
were
content
to
attempt
to
follow
what
the
board
--
what
the
court
had
told
them
to
do
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
had
told
them
it
had
to
do
was
to
consider
at
least
some
of
the
alternative
remedies,
including
organization
expense
--
excess
organizational
expenses
and
counsel
fees
that
had
been
requested
by
other
parties
including
the
union
in
the
heck’s
case
as
alternative
to
the
so
called
make-all
remedy.
on
page
33
of
the
appendix
is
the
board’s
explanation
in
its
supplemental
opinion
in
tiidee
of
what
it
thought
the
remand
meant.
the
board
believes,
they
consider
why
we
find
it
would
be
counterproductive
to
grant
the
union’s
request
for
a
remand
to
the
trial
examiner,
the
board
believes
that
the
alternative
remedies
provided
here
and
after
will
undo
some
of
the
baneful
affects
pointed
out
by
the
court
as
having
resulted
from
respondent’s
clear
and
flagrant
violation
of
the
law.
no,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
frivolity
of
the
defense
or
the
frivolity
of
the
litigation.
these
are
the
effects
that
flow
from
respondent’s
clear
and
flagrant
violation
of
the
law.
indeed,
that’s
how
a
union
basically
loses
it
support
among
the
employees.
the
exception
always
proves
the
rule.
it
won
the
case
to
the
election
in
tiidee,
but
it
lost
in
heck’s
and
that
is
most
common
experience
that
unions
have,
where
you
have
clear
and
flagrant
aggravated
violations
of
a
law
such
as
the
respondent
engaged
in
this
case,
you’re
going
to
inevitably
have
as
a
result,
the
loss
of
support
for
the
union
by
the
employees
whether
it
lost
their
support
either
from
complete
support
to
majority
or
from
majority
to
a
minority.
now,
to
continue
with
the
board's
statement,
these
remedies
will
for;
one
aid
the
union
in
rebuilding
strength
so
that
it
may
bargain
effectively
with
the
respondent
and
also
by
requiring
respondent
that
the
pay
some
board
in
the
litigation
cost
occasioned
by
this
misconduct
similar
brazen
refusals
will
be
discarded.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court.
the
labor
board
contends
that
the
court
of
appeals
usurped
the
board’s
function
of
determining
in
the
first
instance
what
remedies
were
necessary
to
effectuate
the
act,
the
policies
of
the
act
and
that
they
thereby
infringed
upon
on
the
board’s
prerogative.
we
say
no.
we
say
that
the
court
did
not
reach
the
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
that
the
withholding
of
remedies
frustrated
rather
than
effectuated
the
policies
of
the
act.
what
it
did
was
merely
to
hold
that
the
board’s
rationale
for
denying
organizational
expenses
and
counsel
fees
in
the
heck’s
case
could
not
reasonably
really
reconcile
with
the
board’s
supplemental
decision
in
tiidee
and
with
the
purported
distinction
of
heck’s
in
that
tiide
opinion.
if
the
court
below
was
correct
in
its
analysis
of
those
opinions
then
the
court
was
entitled
we
believe,
to
reverse
the
board
for
its
error
of
law,
namely
its
arbitrator
departure
from
its
own
rule.
unless
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
empowered
to
require
the
board
to
follow
the
principles
the
board
says
it
follows,
then
the
court
below
should
be
sustained.
if
a
divergence
arises
between
courts
of
appeals
on
the
question
whether
at
any
given
set
of
circumstances
the
board
is
in
fact
following
its
own
presets.
that
difference
as
all
the
cases
of
conflict
are
for
this
court
to
resolve
ultimately.
to
show
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
merely
holding
the
board
to
its
own
guidelines,
i
quoted
from
the
supplemental
decision
in
tiidee
at
page
33,
that
portion
which
indicates
that
the
board
recognized
that
the
award
of
counsel
fees
and
organizational
expenses,
among
other
measures
was
both
within
its
powers
and
if
necessary
to
and
i
quote
the
board,
“undo
some
of
the
baneful
effects
pointed
out
the
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
tiidee.”
and
what
were
the
baneful
effects
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
tiidee?
there,
the
court
of
appeals
had
explained
that
in
refusal
to
bargain
cases,
to
award
merely
the
board’s
normal
remedies
operated
counter-productively
to
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
act
in
as
much
as
they
enabled
the
wrong
doer
to
retain
the
fruits
of
his
wrong
doings
and
left
uncompensated
and
un-remedied
the
injuries,
which
the
employers’
wrongful
conduct
had
imposed
upon
the
union
and
its
employee
beneficiaries.
both
of
those
are
the
essential
elements
that
are
in
order
--
proper
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
must
contain
as
this
court
has
held.
now,
in
the
tiidee
opinion,
the
board
explained
that
it
had
the
power
to
enter
these
remedies.
it
assumed
that
it
had
the
power
to
enter
these
remedies
and
assumed
that
and
said
that
beyond
this,
we
don’t
think
we
can
go.
we
can’t
go
to
make
whole
remedy,
but
we
could
do
this
and
then
at
page
35
of
the
appendix,
a
portion
that
was
quoted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
the
board
explained
that
it
was
denying
organizational
expenses
in
tiidee
because
and
i
quote,
“we
find
no
nexus
between
the
employer’s
unlawful
conduct
here
under
examination
and
the
union’s
pre-election
organizational
expenses
and
accordingly
we
shall
not
award
them
to
the
union.”
given
the
portion
of
the
supplemental
opinion
that
i
quoted
yesterday,
at
page
33,
the
court
below
was
entire
--
entirely
entitled
we
believe,
to
treat
this
explanation
as
to
the
reason
organizational
expenses
were
not
being
accorded
in
tiidee.
as
a
tacit
admission,
that
if
they
had
been
--
if
there
ever
had
been
such
an
excess,
the
board
would've
ordered
reimbursement
of
the
excess
organizing
expenses.
now,
in
heck’s,
the
board
conceded
the
nexus
between
the
employer’s
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
excess
organizational
expenses.
it
noted
that
as
mr.
friedman
said
yesterday,
probably
these
things
had
occurred.
the
only
reason
the
board
gave
for
denying
recovery
was
that
the
charging
party's
allegedly
subordinate
role
in
unfair
labor
practice
litigation
made
it
inappropriate.
but
that
factor
is
simply
irrelevant
to
whether
the
employers
should
be
required
to
reimburse
a
union
--
a
victim,
the
union,
and
its
members
or
supporters
for
excess
organizing
expenses
resulting
from
the
employer’s
unfair
labor
practices.
those
excess
costs
are
borne
by
all
of
the
employee
supporters
of
the
union
as
such.
they
are
the
victims
of
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practice,
so
they
must
be
made
whole
if
possible.
otherwise,
they
suffer
an
injury
which
is
uncompensated
and
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
are
further
injured
not
merely
by
having
to
have
ultimately
their
dues
and
their
assessments
increased
but
by
the
fact
that
these
are
organizing
expenses
which
the
union
would
otherwise
have
been
able
to
use
for
negotiators
and
for
experts
in
producing
a
better
collective
bargaining
contract.
now,
if
the
board
charging
party's
role
were
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
excess
organizational
fees
should
be
reimbursed,
then
the
board
could
not
award,
make
an
award
of
excess
organizational
expenses
to
a
union
in
any
case
because
the
union’s
role
in
all
cases,
is
according
to
the
board
subordinate.
but
that’s
not
the
reasoning
that
the
board
purported
to
follow
in
its
tiidee
opinion.
it
purported
to
say,
we
know
that
organizational
expenses,
excess
organizational
expenses
should
fairly
be
reimbursed.
we’re
not
going
to
do
it
here
because
there
is
no
nexus,
the
union
suffered
no
nexus,
no
loss
as
the
result
of
the
employer’s
activities.
since
the
board
found
there
was
a
nexus
in
the
heck’s
case
then
its
explanation
doesn’t
wash
and
its
denial
of
these
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
illegal.
as
to
the
legal
fees,
the
only
reasons
that
the
board
offered
for
denying
recovery
in
this
case,
are
the
allegedly
subordinate
role
of
the
charging
party
and
the
assumed
common
law
rule.
by
awarding
counsel
fees
in
tiidee,
to
both
the
union
and
the
board
counsel,
the
board
demonstrated
that
its
conception
of
the
role
of
the
charging
party
to
the
issue
was
absolutely
irrelevant.
if
the
board’s
--
if
the
charging
party’s
role
is
subordinate
and
the
general
counsel’s
role
is
superior
then
as
the
court
perceived
in
tiidee,
the
way
to
take
care
of
the
problem
is
to
award
counsel
fees
against
the
employer
of
both
for
having
unnecessarily
forced
the
burden
of
litigation
on
both.
and
consequent,
as
a
result
of
that,
the
board
can
no
longer
in
this
case
rely
upon
that
reasoning
to
sustain
its
denial
of
litigation
expenses
in
the
heck’s
case.
now,
the
board’s
conception
nevertheless,
treating
it
as
a
matter
raised
in
tiidee,
the
board’s
conception
of
the
role
of
the
charging
party
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
litigation
simply
does
not
swear
with
this
court’s
view
of
the
matter
as
expressed
in
scofield
.
in
scofield
,
the
board
recognized
that
the
statute
itself
carries
with
it
the
germ
of
protection
of
private
interests
and
it
also
recognizes
that
when
the
charging
party
at
"x"
effectively
to
protect
those
private
interests,
it
is
necessarily
also
effectuating
the
public
interest
in
enforcement
of
public
rights
which
the
statute
establishes.
now,
if
that
is
so
and
we
submit
that
can't
denied,
if
that
is
so,
then
the
charging
party’s
counsel
in
a
labor
board
proceeding,
acts
as
private
attorney
general
in
the
same
vital
sense
that
others
do
in
statutes
which
this
court
has
held
to
imply
private
rights
of
actions
where
the
burnt
of
the
litigation
is
borne
by
the
private
party.
but
with
the
blessings
of
the
government
agency
and
usually
with
the
support
of
the
government's
--
government
agency
when
a
case
comes
to
this
court
for
the
private
counsel
seeking
fees,
and
i
speak
particularly
of
cases
like
mills
versus
auto-lite.
the
board
did
not
see
this.
it
took
a
dog
in
the
manger
view
here
unlike
the
attitude
that
most
administrative
agencies
take
when
private
parties
are
acting,
surely,
perhaps
exclusively
in
a
wrong
private
interest,
but
in
fact
in
a
manner
which
benefits
the
public
interest
inescapably.
the
court
should
welcome
and
not
reject
their
support.
the
court
should
reward
their
success
and
make
the
litigation
of
these
matters
a
concern
of
capable
private
counsel.
and
a
way
to
do
that
is
of
course,
as
this
court
has
said
to
award
attorney’s
fees,
particularly
to
them.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
your
honor
as
i
started
by
saying,
this
is
not
a
question
res
integra.
the
court
of
appeals
read
what
the
board
said
in
its
supplemental
decision
in
heck’s
and
the
board
in
heck’s
specifically
said,
as
i
read
yesterday
afternoon,
that
an
award
of
counsel
fees,
the
board
says,
“an
award
of
counsel
fees
will
tend
to
discourage
raising
violations
of
the
act
and
they
said
they
have
the
power
to
do
this
and
they
would
do
this
and
in
heck’s,
in
fact
they
did
do
this.
the
only
distinction
that
they
drew
was
between
willful
defenders
who
have
no
substantial
or
debatable
defense
and
willful
offenders
who
presented
debatable
offense
and
the
board
thought
that
that
distinction
was
controlling.
now,
we
say
that
that
distinction
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable,
and
therefore,
an
error
of
law.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
as
an
initial
proposition,
i
think.
as
if
the
board
--
the
court
were
sitting
without
a
board
opinion
before
it
was
saying
what
do
you
think
it
would
do?
now,
we
say
that
the
board’s
distinction
between
frivolous
defenses
and
willful
violators
who
happen
to
catch
hold
of
the
debatable
defense
is
erroneous
because
it
rests
in
part
upon
this
misconception
of
a
role
of
the
charging
party
and
because
the
board
in
drawing
it
demonstrated
that
it
was
in
fact
relying
upon
what
it
thought
the
common
law
rule
was
as
to
the
award
of
attorney
--
of
attorney’s
fees.
in
cases
of
bad
faith
and
willful
persistent
offenses,
despite
the
fact
that
there
maybe
a
debatable
offense.
now,
insofar
as
the
board
thought
it
was
followed
in
its
opinionated
case
that
it
was
and
i
did
not
hear
mr.
friedman
yesterday
deny
that,
the
language
i
think
makes
it
too
clear.
as
far
as
it
was
following
the
common
law
rule,
its
posture
is
the
same
in
this
case
as
the
sec's
was
in
the
charney
case
where
the
sec
purported
to
follow
what
it
erroneously
conceived
to
be
in
the
common
law.
this
court
reversed
holding
that
the
sec
was
not
bound
to
follow
the
common
law,
but
if
it
was
going
to
follow
it,
it
better
know
what
it
was
doing
and
in
that
case
the
sec
did
not
correctly
perceive
what
the
common
law
was.
so
in
this
case,
we
say
that
the
board
purported
to
follow
the
common
law
rule
and
it
simply
didn't
understand
what
the
common
law
counsel
fees
was.
now,
that's
not
particularly
surprising
because
the
award
of
counsel
fees
is
not
an
area
in
which
the
board
is
expert.
it
did
never
done
it
before.
that
happens
to
be
the
peculiar
expertise
of
the
judiciary
which
in
time
immemorial
its
equity
practice
has
developed
the
award
of
counsel
fees
as
a
measure
of
making
whole
the
aggrieved
victim
of
outrageous
misconduct
and
not
allowing
the
perpetrator
that
kind
of
wrong
doing
to
escape.
so
that,
we
are
not
in
the
area
of
board
expertise
and
that
aspect
of
the
protection
of
the
board
would
normally
be
entitled
to,
does
not
apply
here.
speaking
of
both
organizational
expenses
and
counsel
fees,
the
board
said
at
page
five
of
its
supplemental
brief,
which
your
honors
have
before
you
that
was
filed
on
march
15,
quote,
“such
an
award
helps
assure
the
employees
that
the
union
which
they
have
chosen
as
their
representative
will
have
the
same
resources
to
represent
their
interests
as
it
would
have
absent
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices.”
starting
with
this
as
the
board’s
premise,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
held
that
nothing
in
the
board’s
rationale
in
this
case
or
in
tiidee
warranted
denial
of
counsel
fees
and
organizing
expenses
in
heck’s.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
your
honor.
the
board
filed
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
15th
directed
predominantly
to
the
hecks’
brief
and
the
reasons
that
shouldn’t
be
considered
by
this
court.
i
can’t
explain
why
the
government
having
made
all
the
arguments
in
favor
of
striking
the
brief
doesn’t
add
up
to
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no,
no
it's
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
right,
it’s
that
--
well
on
page
five
appears
this
language
that
i
quote.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
as
i
said,
i
--
since
the
government
has
made
all
the
arguments
in
favor
of
striking,
i
can’t
understand
their
reluctance
to
take
the
final
step
but
in
any
event
the
brief
is
highly
meritorious
one.
the
supplemental
decision
in
tiidee
assigned,
the
board
has
not
merely
power,
but
a
duty
to
enter
orders
which
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
this
has
been
true
ever
since
national
licorice,
309
u.s.
and
phelps
dodge
in
313
u.s.
that
duty
must
be
judicially
enforceable.
if
the
court
finds
that
failure
to
grant
a
remedy
defeats
rather
than
effectuates
the
policy
of
the
act
by
encouraging,
rewarding
instead
of
discouraging
violations,
it
is
the
court’s
prerogative,
we
believe,
and
duty
to
reverse.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
in
our
view,
two
rather
separate
questions.
one
is
to
validity
of
the
court's
holding
that
the
board
acted
arbitrarily
in
not
awarding
organizational
expenses
in
this
case
and
the
second
is
that
the
board
acted
arbitrarily
in
refusing
to
award
legal
fees
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
here
contrary
to
my
friend
mr.
friedman’s
setting
of
the
question
about
what
the
board
should
hold
as
a
general
rule
with
respect
to
legal
fees.
at
least
if
as
a
general
rule
is
meant
to
cover
cases
where
you
do
not
have
a
persistent
aggravated
offender,
one
whose
unfair
labor
practices
are
brazen
and
who
is
in
fact
a
multiple
recidivist.
the
law
has
ways
of
taking
care
of
treating
litigants
of
that
violators
of
that
kind.
it
is
the
same
way
as
it
turns
out
to
the
fields
with
litigants
who
present
frivolous
defenses.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
principle
has
no
application
in
this
case
where
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
did
was
to
hold
that
the
board
had
acted
arbitrarily,
unreasonably,
and
drawn
a
distinction
where
there
is
no
material
difference
in
results,
in
relevant
results
between
what
they
said
about
the
benefits
of
organizational
expenses
to
effectuation
of
the
policies
of
the
act
in
tiidee
and
what
they
said
as
the
board
as
their
reasons
for
organization
expenses
in
tiidee
none
of
which
board
remotely
on
the
organizational
expenses
related
solely
to
the
counsel
fees.
i
mean,
that
it
heck’s,
the
reasons
given
in
heck’s
for
the
denial
of
counsel
fees
were
the
same
as
the
reason
given
for
the
denial
of
organizational
expenses.
they’re
relevant
on
the
question
of
counsel
fees.
they
are
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
organizational
expenses
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
held
and
whether
the
board
was
being
arbitrarily,
when
it
distinguished
aggravated
and
persistent
violators
from
those
who
present
frivolous
defenses
even
others
may
not
be
even
as
brazen
violations
as
the
law
of
the
persistent
recidivist.
now,
we
think
that
unless
the
scope
of
judicial
review
afforded
by
the
administer
procedure
act
is
to
be
narrowed
beyond
toleration
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
allowed
at
least
to
set
aside
administrative
inaction
or
action
when
it
correctly
finds
that
the
action
or
in
action
is
arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
i
have
used
that
term,
which
means
irrational,
not
materially
related
and
supported
by
the
reasoning
given
and
distinctions
without
relevant
differences.
this
is,
i
submit
your
honor
what
the
test
should
be
in
this
case.
did
the
court
of
appeals
--
was
the
court
of
appeals
correct
in
holding
that
the
board
in
effect
was
arbitrary
here.
now
there
are
two
respects
in
which
this
case
is
unique.
one,
it
is
a
case
of
a
multiple
recidivist
whose
brazen
violations
in
the
board’s
own
words
are
company
wide
aggravated
and
pervasive.
the
board
found
that
heck’s
had
a
policy,
a
labor
policy
which
was
opposed
to
policies
of
the
act,
and
as
a
result
of
that
policy,
within
a
relatively
short
time,
between
1965
and
1970,
heck’s
was
involved
in
unfair
practice
litigation
11
times.
during
that
period
as
it
happened,
the
court
of
appeals
for
fourth
circuit
was
holding
that
the
board
couldn’t
get
a
bargain
order
on
authorization
cards.
and
it
was
only
when
that
was
--
it
was
in
that
light
of
that
holding
that
the
board
and
the
trial
examiner
treated
one
or
two
of
these
heck’s
violation
cases.
one
or
two
other
cases
actually
came
to
this
court
in
gissel
as
a
companion
case
and
of
course
the
judgment
below
was
reversed.
now,
heck’s
strategy
was
–-
oh,
i
just
wanted
to
add
that
the
reason
the
board
reversed
the
trial
examiner's
determination
that
there
was
no
refusal
to
bargain
in
bad
faith
was
not
because
it
differed
with
him
on
the
facts,
but
on
it
--
because
its
view
that
heck’s
was
totally
unconcerned
with
whether
the
union
had
a
majority
or
not.
it
wouldn’t
have
bargained
no
matter
what
the
situation
was
because
of
its
background
and
history
of
persistent
unfair
labor
practices,
it
would
have
refused
to
bargain
in
any
event.
it’s
simply
demanded
an
election
to
gain
additional
time
to
undermine
the
union
and
when
it
had
done
that
of
course
it
fought
with
it,
litigation.
now,
the
strategy
that
heck’s
used
was
to
transfer,
discharge
or
close
its
door
or
threaten
to
do
those
things
if
the
union
got
in
to
engage
in
excessive
interrogation,
coercive
interviews
and
illegal
polls.
when
the
union
requested
recognition,
heck’s
would
step
up
its
campaign.
it
routinely
refused
to
look
at
authorization
cards
that
union
tendered
in
support
of
its
request.
it
demanded
an
election
to
gain
time
within
which
to
undermine
the
union
further
and
thereby
forced
the
union
and
the
general
counsel
to
litigate,
to
establish
that
union
had
an
un-coerced
majority
when
it
have
requested
recognition.
now,
the
board
treats
frivolous
litigation
as
if
somehow
the
litigation
had
been
initiated
by
the
employer.
that’s
not
true.
of
course,
the
employers
have
responded
in
this
case.
the
real
way
to
see
that,
the
only
way
to
see
that
is
to
see
that
the
employer
is
willing
to
submit
to
litigation
even
though
he
has
gotten
a
plausible
defense
or
no
matter
how
brazen
his
violations
are
in
the
hope
like
mr.
mccoben
that
something
will
turn
up.
and
if
he
is
able
to
attack
the
union’s
card
showing,
well,
that’s
let
him
free
of
the
hook
because
if
he
has
--
union
hasn’t
got
a
valid
majority
of
un-coerced
cards,
it
doesn’t
have
a
right,
but
that
isn’t
why
he
acted
illegally.
all
of
his
illegal
action
was
devoted
to
destroying
the
support
for
the
union
whether
or
not
they
have
a
majority.
so
what
really
is
happening
here
is
that
employer
is
using,
he
is
provoking
the
litigation.
he
is
provoking
the
union
and
compelling
it
to
resort
to
litigation,
it
and
the
board
to
resort
to
litigation
and
then
he
goes
along,
hopes
he
wins,
he
doesn’t
care
how
long
it
takes
in
effect
for
long
as
long
possible
to
ward
off
the
evil
bad.
and
then
when
the
evil
day
arrives
probably
finds
the
union
totally
impotent
to
engage
in
bargain.
the
board
has
recognized
all
that.
in
its
decision
in
tiidee,
its
supplemental
opinion
in
tiidee
following
the
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals,
the
board
had
this
to
say,
and
oh
yes
before
i
get
to
that
i
should
mention
that
when
mr.
friedman
says
that
the
board’s
decision
--
the
court’s
decision
in
tiidee
related
only
to
frivolous
litigation.
he
omits
the
fact
that
the
remand
in
the
heck’s
itself
was
predicated
not
on
the
frivolity
of
the
defense,
but
on
the
persistent
and
aggravated
bad
faith
conduct
which
the
board
itself
had
found.
so
there
can
be
no
justification
whatever
for
claiming
that
the
board
was
--
could
properly
have
believed
that
all
the
court
of
appeals
meant
was
it
should
award
counsel
fees
in
cases
of
frivolous
litigation
and
not
where
they’re
aggravated
and
persistent
violations
as
where
in
heck’s.
that
distinction
just
simply
blown
out
on
the
basis
of
the
heck’s
remand
itself.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
board
accepts
the
remand
in
the
heck’s
case.
as
we
understand
it
that
means
that
they
were
content
to
attempt
to
follow
what
the
board
--
what
the
court
had
told
them
to
do
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
had
told
them
it
had
to
do
was
to
consider
at
least
some
of
the
alternative
remedies,
including
organization
expense
--
excess
organizational
expenses
and
counsel
fees
that
had
been
requested
by
other
parties
including
the
union
in
the
heck’s
case
as
alternative
to
the
so
called
make-all
remedy.
on
page
33
of
the
appendix
is
the
board’s
explanation
in
its
supplemental
opinion
in
tiidee
of
what
it
thought
the
remand
meant.
the
board
believes,
they
consider
why
we
find
it
would
be
counterproductive
to
grant
the
union’s
request
for
a
remand
to
the
trial
examiner,
the
board
believes
that
the
alternative
remedies
provided
here
and
after
will
undo
some
of
the
baneful
affects
pointed
out
by
the
court
as
having
resulted
from
respondent’s
clear
and
flagrant
violation
of
the
law.
no,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
frivolity
of
the
defense
or
the
frivolity
of
the
litigation.
these
are
the
effects
that
flow
from
respondent’s
clear
and
flagrant
violation
of
the
law.
indeed,
that’s
how
a
union
basically
loses
it
support
among
the
employees.
the
exception
always
proves
the
rule.
it
won
the
case
to
the
election
in
tiidee,
but
it
lost
in
heck’s
and
that
is
most
common
experience
that
unions
have,
where
you
have
clear
and
flagrant
aggravated
violations
of
a
law
such
as
the
respondent
engaged
in
this
case,
you’re
going
to
inevitably
have
as
a
result,
the
loss
of
support
for
the
union
by
the
employees
whether
it
lost
their
support
either
from
complete
support
to
majority
or
from
majority
to
a
minority.
now,
to
continue
with
the
board's
statement,
these
remedies
will
for;
one
aid
the
union
in
rebuilding
strength
so
that
it
may
bargain
effectively
with
the
respondent
and
also
by
requiring
respondent
that
the
pay
some
board
in
the
litigation
cost
occasioned
by
this
misconduct
similar
brazen
refusals
will
be
discarded.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court.
the
labor
board
contends
that
the
court
of
appeals
usurped
the
board’s
function
of
determining
in
the
first
instance
what
remedies
were
necessary
to
effectuate
the
act,
the
policies
of
the
act
and
that
they
thereby
infringed
upon
on
the
board’s
prerogative.
we
say
no.
we
say
that
the
court
did
not
reach
the
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
that
the
withholding
of
remedies
frustrated
rather
than
effectuated
the
policies
of
the
act.
what
it
did
was
merely
to
hold
that
the
board’s
rationale
for
denying
organizational
expenses
and
counsel
fees
in
the
heck’s
case
could
not
reasonably
really
reconcile
with
the
board’s
supplemental
decision
in
tiidee
and
with
the
purported
distinction
of
heck’s
in
that
tiide
opinion.
if
the
court
below
was
correct
in
its
analysis
of
those
opinions
then
the
court
was
entitled
we
believe,
to
reverse
the
board
for
its
error
of
law,
namely
its
arbitrator
departure
from
its
own
rule.
unless
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
empowered
to
require
the
board
to
follow
the
principles
the
board
says
it
follows,
then
the
court
below
should
be
sustained.
if
a
divergence
arises
between
courts
of
appeals
on
the
question
whether
at
any
given
set
of
circumstances
the
board
is
in
fact
following
its
own
presets.
that
difference
as
all
the
cases
of
conflict
are
for
this
court
to
resolve
ultimately.
to
show
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
merely
holding
the
board
to
its
own
guidelines,
i
quoted
from
the
supplemental
decision
in
tiidee
at
page
33,
that
portion
which
indicates
that
the
board
recognized
that
the
award
of
counsel
fees
and
organizational
expenses,
among
other
measures
was
both
within
its
powers
and
if
necessary
to
and
i
quote
the
board,
“undo
some
of
the
baneful
effects
pointed
out
the
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
tiidee.”
and
what
were
the
baneful
effects
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
tiidee?
there,
the
court
of
appeals
had
explained
that
in
refusal
to
bargain
cases,
to
award
merely
the
board’s
normal
remedies
operated
counter-productively
to
effectuating
the
policies
of
the
act
in
as
much
as
they
enabled
the
wrong
doer
to
retain
the
fruits
of
his
wrong
doings
and
left
uncompensated
and
un-remedied
the
injuries,
which
the
employers’
wrongful
conduct
had
imposed
upon
the
union
and
its
employee
beneficiaries.
both
of
those
are
the
essential
elements
that
are
in
order
--
proper
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
must
contain
as
this
court
has
held.
now,
in
the
tiidee
opinion,
the
board
explained
that
it
had
the
power
to
enter
these
remedies.
it
assumed
that
it
had
the
power
to
enter
these
remedies
and
assumed
that
and
said
that
beyond
this,
we
don’t
think
we
can
go.
we
can’t
go
to
make
whole
remedy,
but
we
could
do
this
and
then
at
page
35
of
the
appendix,
a
portion
that
was
quoted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
the
board
explained
that
it
was
denying
organizational
expenses
in
tiidee
because
and
i
quote,
“we
find
no
nexus
between
the
employer’s
unlawful
conduct
here
under
examination
and
the
union’s
pre-election
organizational
expenses
and
accordingly
we
shall
not
award
them
to
the
union.”
given
the
portion
of
the
supplemental
opinion
that
i
quoted
yesterday,
at
page
33,
the
court
below
was
entire
--
entirely
entitled
we
believe,
to
treat
this
explanation
as
to
the
reason
organizational
expenses
were
not
being
accorded
in
tiidee.
as
a
tacit
admission,
that
if
they
had
been
--
if
there
ever
had
been
such
an
excess,
the
board
would've
ordered
reimbursement
of
the
excess
organizing
expenses.
now,
in
heck’s,
the
board
conceded
the
nexus
between
the
employer’s
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
excess
organizational
expenses.
it
noted
that
as
mr.
friedman
said
yesterday,
probably
these
things
had
occurred.
the
only
reason
the
board
gave
for
denying
recovery
was
that
the
charging
party's
allegedly
subordinate
role
in
unfair
labor
practice
litigation
made
it
inappropriate.
but
that
factor
is
simply
irrelevant
to
whether
the
employers
should
be
required
to
reimburse
a
union
--
a
victim,
the
union,
and
its
members
or
supporters
for
excess
organizing
expenses
resulting
from
the
employer’s
unfair
labor
practices.
those
excess
costs
are
borne
by
all
of
the
employee
supporters
of
the
union
as
such.
they
are
the
victims
of
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practice,
so
they
must
be
made
whole
if
possible.
otherwise,
they
suffer
an
injury
which
is
uncompensated
and
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
are
further
injured
not
merely
by
having
to
have
ultimately
their
dues
and
their
assessments
increased
but
by
the
fact
that
these
are
organizing
expenses
which
the
union
would
otherwise
have
been
able
to
use
for
negotiators
and
for
experts
in
producing
a
better
collective
bargaining
contract.
now,
if
the
board
charging
party's
role
were
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
excess
organizational
fees
should
be
reimbursed,
then
the
board
could
not
award,
make
an
award
of
excess
organizational
expenses
to
a
union
in
any
case
because
the
union’s
role
in
all
cases,
is
according
to
the
board
subordinate.
but
that’s
not
the
reasoning
that
the
board
purported
to
follow
in
its
tiidee
opinion.
it
purported
to
say,
we
know
that
organizational
expenses,
excess
organizational
expenses
should
fairly
be
reimbursed.
we’re
not
going
to
do
it
here
because
there
is
no
nexus,
the
union
suffered
no
nexus,
no
loss
as
the
result
of
the
employer’s
activities.
since
the
board
found
there
was
a
nexus
in
the
heck’s
case
then
its
explanation
doesn’t
wash
and
its
denial
of
these
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
illegal.
as
to
the
legal
fees,
the
only
reasons
that
the
board
offered
for
denying
recovery
in
this
case,
are
the
allegedly
subordinate
role
of
the
charging
party
and
the
assumed
common
law
rule.
by
awarding
counsel
fees
in
tiidee,
to
both
the
union
and
the
board
counsel,
the
board
demonstrated
that
its
conception
of
the
role
of
the
charging
party
to
the
issue
was
absolutely
irrelevant.
if
the
board’s
--
if
the
charging
party’s
role
is
subordinate
and
the
general
counsel’s
role
is
superior
then
as
the
court
perceived
in
tiidee,
the
way
to
take
care
of
the
problem
is
to
award
counsel
fees
against
the
employer
of
both
for
having
unnecessarily
forced
the
burden
of
litigation
on
both.
and
consequent,
as
a
result
of
that,
the
board
can
no
longer
in
this
case
rely
upon
that
reasoning
to
sustain
its
denial
of
litigation
expenses
in
the
heck’s
case.
now,
the
board’s
conception
nevertheless,
treating
it
as
a
matter
raised
in
tiidee,
the
board’s
conception
of
the
role
of
the
charging
party
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
litigation
simply
does
not
swear
with
this
court’s
view
of
the
matter
as
expressed
in
scofield
.
in
scofield
,
the
board
recognized
that
the
statute
itself
carries
with
it
the
germ
of
protection
of
private
interests
and
it
also
recognizes
that
when
the
charging
party
at
"x"
effectively
to
protect
those
private
interests,
it
is
necessarily
also
effectuating
the
public
interest
in
enforcement
of
public
rights
which
the
statute
establishes.
now,
if
that
is
so
and
we
submit
that
can't
denied,
if
that
is
so,
then
the
charging
party’s
counsel
in
a
labor
board
proceeding,
acts
as
private
attorney
general
in
the
same
vital
sense
that
others
do
in
statutes
which
this
court
has
held
to
imply
private
rights
of
actions
where
the
burnt
of
the
litigation
is
borne
by
the
private
party.
but
with
the
blessings
of
the
government
agency
and
usually
with
the
support
of
the
government's
--
government
agency
when
a
case
comes
to
this
court
for
the
private
counsel
seeking
fees,
and
i
speak
particularly
of
cases
like
mills
versus
auto-lite.
the
board
did
not
see
this.
it
took
a
dog
in
the
manger
view
here
unlike
the
attitude
that
most
administrative
agencies
take
when
private
parties
are
acting,
surely,
perhaps
exclusively
in
a
wrong
private
interest,
but
in
fact
in
a
manner
which
benefits
the
public
interest
inescapably.
the
court
should
welcome
and
not
reject
their
support.
the
court
should
reward
their
success
and
make
the
litigation
of
these
matters
a
concern
of
capable
private
counsel.
and
a
way
to
do
that
is
of
course,
as
this
court
has
said
to
award
attorney’s
fees,
particularly
to
them.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
your
honor
as
i
started
by
saying,
this
is
not
a
question
res
integra.
the
court
of
appeals
read
what
the
board
said
in
its
supplemental
decision
in
heck’s
and
the
board
in
heck’s
specifically
said,
as
i
read
yesterday
afternoon,
that
an
award
of
counsel
fees,
the
board
says,
“an
award
of
counsel
fees
will
tend
to
discourage
raising
violations
of
the
act
and
they
said
they
have
the
power
to
do
this
and
they
would
do
this
and
in
heck’s,
in
fact
they
did
do
this.
the
only
distinction
that
they
drew
was
between
willful
defenders
who
have
no
substantial
or
debatable
defense
and
willful
offenders
who
presented
debatable
offense
and
the
board
thought
that
that
distinction
was
controlling.
now,
we
say
that
that
distinction
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable,
and
therefore,
an
error
of
law.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
as
an
initial
proposition,
i
think.
as
if
the
board
--
the
court
were
sitting
without
a
board
opinion
before
it
was
saying
what
do
you
think
it
would
do?
now,
we
say
that
the
board’s
distinction
between
frivolous
defenses
and
willful
violators
who
happen
to
catch
hold
of
the
debatable
defense
is
erroneous
because
it
rests
in
part
upon
this
misconception
of
a
role
of
the
charging
party
and
because
the
board
in
drawing
it
demonstrated
that
it
was
in
fact
relying
upon
what
it
thought
the
common
law
rule
was
as
to
the
award
of
attorney
--
of
attorney’s
fees.
in
cases
of
bad
faith
and
willful
persistent
offenses,
despite
the
fact
that
there
maybe
a
debatable
offense.
now,
insofar
as
the
board
thought
it
was
followed
in
its
opinionated
case
that
it
was
and
i
did
not
hear
mr.
friedman
yesterday
deny
that,
the
language
i
think
makes
it
too
clear.
as
far
as
it
was
following
the
common
law
rule,
its
posture
is
the
same
in
this
case
as
the
sec's
was
in
the
charney
case
where
the
sec
purported
to
follow
what
it
erroneously
conceived
to
be
in
the
common
law.
this
court
reversed
holding
that
the
sec
was
not
bound
to
follow
the
common
law,
but
if
it
was
going
to
follow
it,
it
better
know
what
it
was
doing
and
in
that
case
the
sec
did
not
correctly
perceive
what
the
common
law
was.
so
in
this
case,
we
say
that
the
board
purported
to
follow
the
common
law
rule
and
it
simply
didn't
understand
what
the
common
law
counsel
fees
was.
now,
that's
not
particularly
surprising
because
the
award
of
counsel
fees
is
not
an
area
in
which
the
board
is
expert.
it
did
never
done
it
before.
that
happens
to
be
the
peculiar
expertise
of
the
judiciary
which
in
time
immemorial
its
equity
practice
has
developed
the
award
of
counsel
fees
as
a
measure
of
making
whole
the
aggrieved
victim
of
outrageous
misconduct
and
not
allowing
the
perpetrator
that
kind
of
wrong
doing
to
escape.
so
that,
we
are
not
in
the
area
of
board
expertise
and
that
aspect
of
the
protection
of
the
board
would
normally
be
entitled
to,
does
not
apply
here.
speaking
of
both
organizational
expenses
and
counsel
fees,
the
board
said
at
page
five
of
its
supplemental
brief,
which
your
honors
have
before
you
that
was
filed
on
march
15,
quote,
“such
an
award
helps
assure
the
employees
that
the
union
which
they
have
chosen
as
their
representative
will
have
the
same
resources
to
represent
their
interests
as
it
would
have
absent
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices.”
starting
with
this
as
the
board’s
premise,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
held
that
nothing
in
the
board’s
rationale
in
this
case
or
in
tiidee
warranted
denial
of
counsel
fees
and
organizing
expenses
in
heck’s.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
your
honor.
the
board
filed
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
15th
directed
predominantly
to
the
hecks’
brief
and
the
reasons
that
shouldn’t
be
considered
by
this
court.
i
can’t
explain
why
the
government
having
made
all
the
arguments
in
favor
of
striking
the
brief
doesn’t
add
up
to
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no,
no
it's
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
right,
it’s
that
--
well
on
page
five
appears
this
language
that
i
quote.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
as
i
said,
i
--
since
the
government
has
made
all
the
arguments
in
favor
of
striking,
i
can’t
understand
their
reluctance
to
take
the
final
step
but
in
any
event
the
brief
is
highly
meritorious
one.
the
supplemental
decision
in
tiidee
assigned,
the
board
has
not
merely
power,
but
a
duty
to
enter
orders
which
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
this
has
been
true
ever
since
national
licorice,
309
u.s.
and
phelps
dodge
in
313
u.s.
that
duty
must
be
judicially
enforceable.
if
the
court
finds
that
failure
to
grant
a
remedy
defeats
rather
than
effectuates
the
policy
of
the
act
by
encouraging,
rewarding
instead
of
discouraging
violations,
it
is
the
court’s
prerogative,
we
believe,
and
duty
to
reverse.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
