mr.
friedman,
you
don’t
need
to
respond
immediately
to
my
question
but
there
is
a
question
in
here
about
the
status,
if
any,
of
the
employer
heck's
in
this
case
that
you
know
there
is
a
motion
to
strike
their
brief.
so
they
were
not
allowed
to
intervene
and
then
after
we
denied
certiorari,
they
were
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
so
on.
i
hope
before
this
argument
is
finished,
there
will
be
some
little
straightening
on
this.
justice
potter
stewart
you
may
but
don’t
feel
--
justice
potter
stewart
review
of
the
denial
of

justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
pending
before
some
court
of
appeals,
the
tiidee
case.
justice

stewart
power.
justice
potter
stewart
the
board’s
power
to
do
this?
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
you
concede
the
board’s
power,
don’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
after
all
the
board
did
decide
the
tiidee
case
and
that's
why
it
had
power?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you

at
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart

isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
joined
that
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
i
haven’t
seen
it.
i
missed
that
somehow.
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
so
what
have
you
done
with
respect
to
that
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
subsequently
they
were
allowed
to
intervene?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
an
order
denying
leave
to
file
this,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
a
motion
to
strike.
justice
potter
stewart

has
neither
been
granted
nor
denied.
