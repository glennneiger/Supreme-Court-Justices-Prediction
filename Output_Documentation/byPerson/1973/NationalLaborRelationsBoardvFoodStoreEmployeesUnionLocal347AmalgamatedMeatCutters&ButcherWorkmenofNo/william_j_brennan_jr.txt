if

justice

the
first
of
the
cases
is
number
73-370,
national
labor
relations
board
versus
the
food
store
employees
union.
in
this
case,
the
national
labor
relations
board
rejected
the
argument
of
respondent
union,
the
charging
party
in
this
unfair
labor
practice
case,
that
the
remedy
ordered
by
the
board
should
include
a
provision,
ordering
the
employer
to
reimburse
the
union
for
its
litigation
expenses.
the
union
sought
review
of
that
refusal
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
colombia
circuit,
and
i
have
“agreed”
with
the
board,
but
instead
of
remanding
the
case
to
the
board
for
further
consideration,
the
court
itself
enlarged
the
board's
order
to
add
a
provision
requiring
the
employer
to
pay
not
only
the
union
but
also
the
board
the
costs
and
expenses
incurred
by
each
of
them
in
connection
with
the
litigation.
the
courts
of
appeals,
under
sections
10
(e)
and
(f)
of
the
act,
have
authority,
and
i
quote
the
statue,
to
“make
and
enter
a
decree
modifying,
and
enforcing
as
so
modified”
board
orders.
what
we
hold
in
this
case
is
the
court
of
appeals
action
in
enlarging
the
board's
remedies
for
the
reasons
expressed
in
our
opinion,
was
an
improper
exercise
of
that
authority.
we,
therefore,
unanimously
reverse
so
much
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment,
as
enlarged
the
board's
order.
