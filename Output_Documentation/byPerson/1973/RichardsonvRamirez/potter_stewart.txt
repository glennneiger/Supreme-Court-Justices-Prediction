justice
potter
stewart
of
what
had
he
been
convicted?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
these
applications
of
--
how
many
these
people
--
how
many
applications
to
register
in
which
turns
out
to
somebody
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
do
you
get
in
mendocino
county
in
the
courts
for
a
year?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
relatively
small
county
in
california.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
of
this
1218
you
say
that
you
estimate
you
got
a
year,
how
many
of
these
convicted
felons
which
you
estimate
that
you
say
fall
under
the
exceptions
in
otsuka
or
at
least
the
definition
in
otsuka
that
you
respond
by
permitting
him
to
register
and
vote,
half
of
them
or
one
third
of
them
or
none
of
them
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
understand
it
made
the
statutory
definition
much
more
flexible?
justice
potter
stewart
and
gave
to
people
in
your
position
considerable
discretion?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
exercised
differently
by
different
district
attorneys
in
the
various
county’s
we're
told
in
these
briefs?
justice
potter
stewart
but
first,
if
you
try
to
answer
my
question,
that
would
be
nice
of
you.
justice
potter
stewart
and
either
forgery
or
burglary
in
your
view
makes
a
man
ineligible
to
register
and
vote
in
your
county?
justice
potter
stewart
so
as
far
as
you
know
is
a
convicted
is
any
--
a
person
convicted
a
either
forgery
or
burglary
permitted
to
vote
in
any
county
in
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
otsuka
was
decided
in
what
year?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
how
many
counties
are
there
in
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
roth?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
roth,
i’m
looking
at
exhibit
1
of
the
--
where
is
it
--
in
the
--
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandate
which
appears
on
page
28
of
the
appendix
which
is
a
report
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
california
regarding
the
right
to
vote
of
ex-felons
in
california
dated
may
30,
1972,
which
indicates
as
you
know
been
denied
that
there
was
been
extraordinarily
uneven
application?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
in
the
various
county
of
a
state,
for
example,
the
crime
of
murder
disqualifies
a
person
from
voting
in
at
least
four
counties
but
does
not
disqualified
in
at
least
six
counties.
sale
of
drugs
disqualifies
an
applicant
of
at
least
5
counties
but
not
in
at
least
at
nine
counties
and
so
on,
you’re
familiar
i
know
with
that
report.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
so,
even
if
you’re
wholly
correct
in
your
understanding
of
second
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
a
state
could
constitutionally
by
all
convicted
felons
from
registering
and
voting.
does
that
really
answer
the
equal
protection
problem
inherit
in
the
secretary’s
states
report?
justice
potter
stewart
in
california
in
fact
it
does
not
that
it
allows
--
this
petitioner
was
or
rather
this
respondent
was
convicted
of
what,
burglary,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
all
three
of
those
respondents
would
have
been
allowed
to
vote
in
some
of
the
counties
in
california?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
have
not
been
allowed
to
vote
in
your
county.
now,
regardless
of
the
power
of
california
to
bar
every
convicted
felon
from
voting
if
even
handedly
applied,
doesn’t
this
basic
equal
protection
problem
still
exist,
even
if
you’re
quite
right
in
your
interpretation
of
the
second
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
they
haven’t
done
it
so
far?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don’t
follow
the
facts
that
it
would
be
accuracy
of
the
secretary
of
the
state's
report?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
true
is
it
not
that
these
respondents,
all
of
them
would
have
been
allowed
to
vote
in
some
counties
in
california?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
--
perhaps
we
should
carry
this
on
private,
but
we
[laughter]
we
view
judgments
here
and
not
opinions
and
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
was
that
the
statute
is
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
we
can
affirm
that
on
the
basis
that
it
is
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
because
of
its
wholly
uneven
and
like
a
precious
enforcement
in
the
different
counties
of
the
state
of
california
without
either
agreeing
or
disagreeing
with
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california.
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
sure
you’re
going
to
say
yes
of
course,
we
could
do
that
because
we
could
do
whatever
five
votes
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
point
is
they
might
well
prevail
in
their
application
for
certificate
of
rehabilitation
and
that
would
be
their
argument
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
required
them
to
exhaust
that
remedy
before
coming
to
the
court,
but
the
supreme
court
of
california
didn’t
and
that’s
a
matter
of
state
law.
there’s
nothing
for
us
to
(voice
overlap)
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
what
had
he
been
convicted?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
these
applications
of
--
how
many
these
people
--
how
many
applications
to
register
in
which
turns
