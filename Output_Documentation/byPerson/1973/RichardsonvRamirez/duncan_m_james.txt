mr.
duncan
m.
james
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i’d
like
to
begin
by
correcting
the
two
citations
that
appear
in
petitioner’s
replied
brief
that
was
filed
on
january
8.
the
first
correction
is
on
page
4,
footnote
3,
the
citation
of
the
united
states
versus
reese.
the
lawyer's
edition
citation
was
used
their
as
28.
the
correct
citation
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
the
page
4.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
it’s
said
to
be
28
lawyer's
edition
and
it’s
actually
volume
23.
and
on
the
next
page,
page
5
in
the
parenthesis,
it
says
james
versus
bowman
190
us
124;
the
correct
citation
is
190
us
127.
also,
i’d
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
mendocino
county,
we
have
somewhat
of
an
inadequate
law
library
and
we
only
have
lawyers
editions
and
on
page
4,
the
citation
on
page
4
is
the
united
states
versus
reese
is
referred
to
as
being
a
note
and
apparently
this
is
an
editor’s
note
regarding
the
right
of
women
to
vote.
however,
the
opinion
as
quoted
in
the
footnote
on
the
page
5
is
the
portion
of
the
opinion
of
the
court.
what
i’d
like
to
do
first
i
think
is
point
out
to
the
court
how
a
voter
registers,
at
least
in
mendocino
county,
california
being
a
small
rural
county
of
the
northwestern
part
of
the
state.
initially,
the
person
desiring
to
register
makes
contact
with
the
county
clerk
or
deputy
county
clerk
and
completes
a
form.
that
form
appears
in
the
appendix
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
one
of
the
questions
in
the
form
is,
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony?”
if
that
box
is
checked
yes,
the
person
is
given
another
form,
a
portion
of
which
is
filled
out
by
the
deputy
registrar,
and
a
portion
of
which
is
filled
out
by
the
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
that
felony.
the
person
who
is
convicted
of
a
felony
puts
down
the
date
of
the
conviction,
the
jurisdiction
where
the
conviction
took
place
and
the
offense
for
which
he
would
he
or
she
was
convicted.
that
form
is
then
forwarded
to
my
office
for
my
review.
many
times,
i
found
in
the
past
that
the
individuals
completing
the
form
would
not
give
us
adequate
information.
and
so,
we’ve
asked
for
all
of
that
details
so
i
can
contact
through
the
mails,
the
jurisdiction
in
which
the
person
was
convicted
to
get
a
certified
copy
of
the
conviction.
after
receiving
the
certified
copy
of
the
conviction
are
then
proceed
to
make
a
determination
under
the
california
case
otsuka
versus
hite
which
is
64
cal,
2d
594
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
crime
is
infamous
as
well
as
taking
into
the
consideration
article
ii,
section
iii
of
the
california
constitution,
and
article
xx,
section
xii
of
the
california
constitution.
under
those,
the
case
of
otsuka
notes
two
constitutional
sections.
the
basic
crimes
that
we
look
to
were
murder,
manslaughter,
mayhem,
rape,
arson,
robbery,
burglary,
larceny,
embezzlement
and
misappropriation
of
public
moneys,
perjury,
forgery,
malfeasance
in
office
and
bribery.
prior
to
the
otsuka
decision
in
california,
any
case
which
or
any
conviction
which
resulted
in
state
prison
sentence
was
considered
infamous.
otsuka
modified
that
position.
then
sometimes
on
occasion,
we
find
that
the
person
has
been
convicted
of
an
infamous
crime
and
i
complete
the
form
to
indicate
whether
or
not
a
person
is
disqualified
and
i
sign
the
form
and
that
form
is
sent
back
to
the
individual
who
registered.
now,
in
one
instance
in
my
county
after
having
sent
that
form
back,
an
action
was
brought
against
our
county
clerk,
viola
richardson,
by
a
fellow
who
happened
to
be
named
david
richardson
and
was
no
relation
to
her.
but
also
in
that
case,
i
was
sued
and
so
the
case
in
the
county
was
james
versus
--
richardson
versus
james
and
richardson,
rather
than
richardson
versus
richardson
because
they
did
not
want
it
to
look
like
a
divorce
action
and
i
was
the
cause
of
the
divorce.
in
that
case,
what
transpired
was
the
plaintiff
proceeded
under
section
350
of
the
california
elections
code,
requesting
the
court
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
his
conviction
was
infamous.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
he
was
convicted
of
burglary
in
the
second
degree
and
he
had
served
his
sentence
in
state
prison.
he
had
spent
about
18
months
in
state
prison.
i
believe
that
conviction
carries
indeterminate
term
of
six
months
to
10
years
in
california
and
the
court
in
that
case
decided
that
under
the
otsuka
decision
that
that
crime
wasn’t
that
infamous
and
that
mr.
richardson
wasn’t
that
disqualified
from
the
right
to
vote.
that
case
is
presently
pending
in
the
california
court
of
appeals
by
stipulation
of
counsel
that
it
is
awaiting
the
final
determination
in
this
case.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
in
mendocino
county,
first
let
me
say,
we
have
approximate
25,000
registered
voters.
the
population
of
county
is
around
60,000.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
that
is
right.
there
are
about
30
counties
though
that
are
or
25
counties
that
are
smaller
than
this.
in
the
course
of
a
year,
i
would
imagine
i
receive
no
more
than
a
dozen
or
18.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
no,
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
that
attempt
to
register?
mr.
duncan
m.
james
no,
i
could
not
tell
you.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
agree
and
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
no,
i
don’t
believe
they
are
in
a
state
wide
basis.
i
can
only
speak
as
to
my
particular
county
and
since
we
have
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
excuse
me
i
didn’t
hear
the
question.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
on
a
per
year
basis?
mr.
duncan
m.
james
we
convict
the
approximately
250
people
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
can’t
tell
you
our
county
[laughter]
is
full
of
beautiful
redwoods
in
which
a
great
number
of
people
live
a
very
simple
life
and
these
people;
we
do
not
know
who
is
involved
or
anything.
i
will
tell
you
in
richardson
as
the
result
of
the
richardson
versus
james
case,
as
the
result
of
the
ramirez
versus
brown
case,
david
richardson
was
able
to
register
to
vote
since
there
was
no
stay
order
and
we
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
this
court
will
grant
a
certiorari
to
california
decision
is
in
effect.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
it
was.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
certainly
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
it
did.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
it
did.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
let
me
point
this
out
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
okay,
i
would
say
of
the
amount
the
people
that
apply
to
vote
maybe
25%
fall
into
the
crimes
that
aren’t
set
forth
in
otsuka
the
constitution
provision.
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
burglary
or
a
forgery.
like
the
last
one
i
had
was
just
before
i
came
back
here
and
it
was
forgery
conviction.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
is
because
of
article
xx,
section
xi
of
the
california
constitution,
it
specifically
names
forgery
and
it
is
because
the
footnote
10
in
otsuka
that
specifically
names
burglary
as
being
infamous
crimes.
now,
i
am
simply
looking
to
what
otsuka
did
say
and
what
the
constitution
did
say
prior
to
ramirez
versus
brown
decision.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
it’s
my
understanding
from
the
briefs
filed
by
respondents
that
yes,
some
counties
do
permit
it.
what
happened
is
otsuka
created
a
confusion
throughout
the
county.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
would
imagine
some
of
the
county
counsels
did
not
look
to
or
any
further
than
otsuka
for
an
interpretation.
like
i
did
do
approximately
five
years
ago
when
i
first
became
involved
in
this
as
district
attorney.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
believe
1966.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
there’s
58
counties.
now,
as
i
pointed
out,
mr.
david
richardson
proceeded
under
section
350
of
the
elections
code
to
make
a
determination.
in
the
briefs
for
petitioner,
i
mean,
excuse
me
for
respondents,
they
argued
that
there
innumerable
where
they
have
been
no
violations
since
around
1906
and
1920
i
believe.
i’d
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
at
least
excepting
with
mr.
justice
mosk
of
the
california
supreme
court
said
as
being
true
that
there
over
250
violations
of
the
elections
code.
i
would
submit
that
most
of
the
violations
in
the
elections
code
that
constitute
misdemeanors
and
california
of
course
would
not
disenfranchise
a
person.
they
point
out
that
or
respondent
points
out
in
its
brief
that
the
possibility
of
voter
fraud
is
almost
nonexistent
anymore.
however,
in
the
less
metropolitan
counties
of
california,
we
don’t
have
such
sophisticated
equipment
as
voting
machines
where
you
go
in
and
apparently
you
pull
levers
and
then
you
pull
the
arm
at
one
end
just
like
working
in
the
one
--
i
hate
to
use
the
analogy,
but
like
one
arm
bandit
in
nevada,
we
don’t
have
that.
we
have
a
little
marker
that
has
little
x
that
we
go
in
and
we
press
in
different
little
spots
with
our
own
hand.
in
footnote
26,
respondents
argued
that
even
though
california
says
that
any
person
who
is
elector
under
section
275
of
the
government
code
says
any
elector
in
state
of
california
is
entitled
the
hold
office.
they
say
that
its
fine
because
under
our
present
system
of
politics
throughout
the
nation
as
well
as
throughout
california,
a
person
who
would
have
a
felony
conviction
that
would
easilably
--
easily
found
and
i’d
like
to
set
that
aside
for
a
minute
because
in
my
county
disregarding
nine
justice
court
judges
and
two
superior
court
judges,
there
are
11
elected
officials.
at
the
last
election,
only
two
of
those
11
had
any
opposition
to
office.
the
two
that
did
was
the
sheriff
and
the
treasurer,
none
of
the
others
did
and
there
was
no
way
for
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
throughout
california,
many
elected
officials
occasionally
do
have
opposition
and
there
is
basically
no
way
to
find
out
if
a
man
had
been
convicted
of
felony
because
in
california
under
section
1203.4,
i
believe
or
the
1203.3
of
the
california
penal
code
are
record
to
be
expunged
and
a
person
no
longer
is
checking
a
box
that
says,
“yes,
i
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony.”
they
can
now
say,
"no"
and
so
they
talk
about
it’s
easy
to
discover
and
we
submit
that
it’s
not
as
easy
as
they
would
let
it
to
be
represented
to
be.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
a
few
minutes
ago
was
whether
or
not
there
was
statute,
a
federal
statute
that
went
along
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
what
i’d
like
to
bring
to
attention
of
the
court
is
2
us
code
section
6
which
is
a
restatement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
2
which
provides
for
the
disenfranchise.
it
says
you
can
abridge
--
you
cannot
abridge
except
for
crime
or
rebellion
and
i
do
not
have
the
legislative
history
to
say
when
that
section
was
passed,
but
i
would
assume
that
at
the
time
the
us
code
section
was
passed
that
they
were
not
under
the
pressures
that
mr.
glick
refers
to.
i'd
also
like
to
comment
to
the
court
that
in
reviewing
the
history
of
the
constitution,
it
was
interesting
to
read
some
of
the
comments
that
occurred
during
the
arguments
or
hearings
on
the
fifteenth
amendment.
during
the
course
of
the
hearings
on
the
fifteenth
amendment,
there
were
quite
a
number
of
proposed
amendments
which
included
exactly
the
same
language
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
except
for
crime
or
other
rebellion.
and
i
would
submit
that,
as
i
believe
it
was
willard
warner,
a
representative
from
this
state
of
alabama
indicated
that
it
would
seemed
that
the
states
should
have
the
right
under
that
small
limited
classification
to
accept
from
those
persons
the
right
to
vote.
we
submit
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
applied
because
this
constitutes
an
exception
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
section
2
clearly
says,
except
for
rebellion
or
other
crime
when
they’re
talking
about
the
reduction
in
the
representation.
now,
the
equal
protection
clause
seems
to
act
as
a
protection
to
avoid
what
the
last
part
of
section
2
says
that
if
you
deny
the
right
to
vote
then
we’re
going
to
reduce
your
representation
and
what
the
equal
protection
clause
is
saying,
at
least,
i
believe
it
says
is,
"no,
we
don’t
want
to
do
that."
the
state
is
entitled
to
a
full
representation.
so
if
you
disenfranchise
a
male
inhabit
30
years
old,
we’re
going
to
say
that
because
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
because
of
the
twenty-sixth
amendment,
this
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
so,
i
submit
that
although
in
california
maybe
as
applied,
there
it
is
an
unequal
application.
it
is
not
a
denial
of
the
states
of
right
to
disenfranchise.
we
have
heard
about
all
these
people
who
go
through
the
--
or
who
don’t
want
to
vote
or
who
are
afraid
to
go
register
to
vote
because
of
the
otsuka
decision.
but
yet
as
respondents
indicate,
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
34,000
plus
persons
were
released
from
state
person
from
1968
to
1971.
there
is
a
procedure
under
the
california
penal
code
to
get
a
certificate
of
rehabilitation
which
gets
back
for
you
when
you
go
through
the
administrative
judicial
process
and
up
to
government
to
get
the
right
to
vote
back
except
for
a
person
convicted
twice
separately.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
excuse
me?
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
it
is
and
in
fact
it
provides
for
appointment
of
counsel.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
what?
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
would
say
that
you
cannot
afford
counsel,
one
of
the
sections
in
the
48
--
4852
point
something
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
provides
for
appointment
to
the
public
defender
to
give
it
to
you,
to
go
through
the
court
of
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
he
hasn’t
--
he
is
only
done
once.
in
my
county
in
five
years
there
is
only
been
one
application
for
a
certificate
of
rehabilitation.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
i
think
it’s
very
poor
[laughter]
because
the
procedure
is
there
yet
nobody
wants
to
go
through
it.
respondents
here
never
went
through
it.
there
is
no
indication
that
they
applied
and
were
rejected
by
the
governor.
in
the
same
period
of
time,
68
through
71,
only
450
filed
for
certificate
of
rehabilitation.
they’re
released
from
prison
that
they
are
entitled
to
go
through
that
procedure.
and
out
of
those
450
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
that
is
right.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
that
is
correct.
it
was
just
--
the
procedure
is
there
in
available
for
those
who
want
to
use
franchise
to
go
through
the
certificate
of
rehabilitation,
and
almost
63%
of
those
that
did
apply
were
granted.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i’d
like
to
begin
by
correcting
the
two
citations
that
appear
in
petitioner’s
replied
brief
that
was
filed
on
january
8.
the
first
correction
is
on
page
4,
footnote
3,
the
citation
of
the
united
states
versus
reese.
the
lawyer's
edition
citation
was
used
their
as
28.
the
correct
citation
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
the
page
4.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
it’s
said
to
be
28
lawyer's
edition
and
it’s
actually
volume
23.
and
on
the
next
page,
page
5
in
the
parenthesis,
it
says
james
versus
bowman
190
us
124;
the
correct
citation
is
190
us
127.
also,
i’d
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
mendocino
county,
we
have
somewhat
of
an
inadequate
law
library
and
we
only
have
lawyers
editions
and
on
page
4,
the
citation
on
page
4
is
the
united
states
versus
reese
is
referred
to
as
being
a
note
and
apparently
this
is
an
editor’s
note
regarding
the
right
of
women
to
vote.
however,
the
opinion
as
quoted
in
the
footnote
on
the
page
5
is
the
portion
of
the
opinion
of
the
court.
what
i’d
like
to
do
first
i
think
is
point
out
to
the
court
how
a
voter
registers,
at
least
in
mendocino
county,
california
being
a
small
rural
county
of
the
northwestern
part
of
the
state.
initially,
the
person
desiring
to
register
makes
contact
with
the
county
clerk
or
deputy
county
clerk
and
completes
a
form.
that
form
appears
in
the
appendix
of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
one
of
the
questions
in
the
form
is,
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony?”
if
that
box
is
checked
yes,
the
person
is
given
another
form,
a
portion
of
which
is
filled
out
by
the
deputy
registrar,
and
a
portion
of
which
is
filled
out
by
the
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
that
felony.
the
person
who
is
convicted
of
a
felony
puts
down
the
date
of
the
conviction,
the
jurisdiction
where
the
conviction
took
place
and
the
offense
for
which
he
would
he
or
she
was
convicted.
that
form
is
then
forwarded
to
my
office
for
my
review.
many
times,
i
found
in
the
past
that
the
individuals
completing
the
form
would
not
give
us
adequate
information.
and
so,
we’ve
asked
for
all
of
that
details
so
i
can
contact
through
the
mails,
the
jurisdiction
in
which
the
person
was
convicted
to
get
a
certified
copy
of
the
conviction.
after
receiving
the
certified
copy
of
the
conviction
are
then
proceed
to
make
a
determination
under
the
california
case
otsuka
versus
hite
which
is
64
cal,
2d
594
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
crime
is
infamous
as
well
as
taking
into
the
consideration
article
ii,
section
iii
of
the
california
constitution,
and
article
xx,
section
xii
of
the
california
constitution.
under
those,
the
case
of
otsuka
notes
two
constitutional
sections.
the
basic
crimes
that
we
look
to
were
murder,
manslaughter,
mayhem,
rape,
arson,
robbery,
burglary,
larceny,
embezzlement
and
misappropriation
of
public
moneys,
perjury,
forgery,
malfeasance
in
office
and
bribery.
prior
to
the
otsuka
decision
in
california,
any
case
which
or
any
conviction
which
resulted
in
state
prison
sentence
was
considered
infamous.
otsuka
modified
that
position.
then
sometimes
on
occasion,
we
find
that
the
person
has
been
convicted
of
an
infamous
crime
and
i
complete
the
form
to
indicate
whether
or
not
a
person
is
disqualified
and
i
sign
the
form
and
that
form
is
sent
back
to
the
individual
who
registered.
now,
in
one
instance
in
my
county
after
having
sent
that
form
back,
an
action
was
brought
against
our
county
clerk,
viola
richardson,
by
a
fellow
who
happened
to
be
named
david
richardson
and
was
no
relation
to
her.
but
also
in
that
case,
i
was
sued
and
so
the
case
in
the
county
was
james
versus
--
richardson
versus
james
and
richardson,
rather
than
richardson
versus
richardson
because
they
did
not
want
it
to
look
like
a
divorce
action
and
i
was
the
cause
of
the
divorce.
in
that
case,
what
transpired
was
the
plaintiff
proceeded
under
section
350
of
the
california
elections
code,
requesting
the
court
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
his
conviction
was
infamous.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
he
was
convicted
of
burglary
in
the
second
degree
and
he
had
served
his
sentence
in
state
prison.
he
had
spent
about
18
months
in
state
prison.
i
believe
that
conviction
carries
indeterminate
term
of
six
months
to
10
years
in
california
and
the
court
in
that
case
decided
that
under
the
otsuka
decision
that
that
crime
wasn’t
that
infamous
and
that
mr.
richardson
wasn’t
that
disqualified
from
the
right
to
vote.
that
case
is
presently
pending
in
the
california
court
of
appeals
by
stipulation
of
counsel
that
it
is
awaiting
the
final
determination
in
this
case.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
in
mendocino
county,
first
let
me
say,
we
have
approximate
25,000
registered
voters.
the
population
of
county
is
around
60,000.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
that
is
right.
there
are
about
30
counties
though
that
are
or
25
counties
that
are
smaller
than
this.
in
the
course
of
a
year,
i
would
imagine
i
receive
no
more
than
a
dozen
or
18.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
no,
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
that
attempt
to
register?
mr.
duncan
m.
james
no,
i
could
not
tell
you.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
agree
and
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
no,
i
don’t
believe
they
are
in
a
state
wide
basis.
i
can
only
speak
as
to
my
particular
county
and
since
we
have
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
excuse
me
i
didn’t
hear
the
question.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
on
a
per
year
basis?
mr.
duncan
m.
james
we
convict
the
approximately
250
people
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
can’t
tell
you
our
county
[laughter]
is
full
of
beautiful
redwoods
in
which
a
great
number
of
people
live
a
very
simple
life
and
these
people;
we
do
not
know
who
is
involved
or
anything.
i
will
tell
you
in
richardson
as
the
result
of
the
richardson
versus
james
case,
as
the
result
of
the
ramirez
versus
brown
case,
david
richardson
was
able
to
register
to
vote
since
there
was
no
stay
order
and
we
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
this
court
will
grant
a
certiorari
to
california
decision
is
in
effect.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
it
was.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
certainly
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
it
did.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
it
did.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
let
me
point
this
out
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
okay,
i
would
say
of
the
amount
the
people
that
apply
to
vote
maybe
25%
fall
into
the
crimes
that
aren’t
set
forth
in
otsuka
the
constitution
provision.
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
burglary
or
a
forgery.
like
the
last
one
i
had
was
just
before
i
came
back
here
and
it
was
forgery
conviction.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
is
because
of
article
xx,
section
xi
of
the
california
constitution,
it
specifically
names
forgery
and
it
is
because
the
footnote
10
in
otsuka
that
specifically
names
burglary
as
being
infamous
crimes.
now,
i
am
simply
looking
to
what
otsuka
did
say
and
what
the
constitution
did
say
prior
to
ramirez
versus
brown
decision.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
it’s
my
understanding
from
the
briefs
filed
by
respondents
that
yes,
some
counties
do
permit
it.
what
happened
is
otsuka
created
a
confusion
throughout
the
county.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
would
imagine
some
of
the
county
counsels
did
not
look
to
or
any
further
than
otsuka
for
an
interpretation.
like
i
did
do
approximately
five
years
ago
when
i
first
became
involved
in
this
as
district
attorney.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
believe
1966.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
there’s
58
counties.
now,
as
i
pointed
out,
mr.
david
richardson
proceeded
under
section
350
of
the
elections
code
to
make
a
determination.
in
the
briefs
for
petitioner,
i
mean,
excuse
me
for
respondents,
they
argued
that
there
innumerable
where
they
have
been
no
violations
since
around
1906
and
1920
i
believe.
i’d
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
at
least
excepting
with
mr.
justice
mosk
of
the
california
supreme
court
said
as
being
true
that
there
over
250
violations
of
the
elections
code.
i
would
submit
that
most
of
the
violations
in
the
elections
code
that
constitute
misdemeanors
and
california
of
course
would
not
disenfranchise
a
person.
they
point
out
that
or
respondent
points
out
in
its
brief
that
the
possibility
of
voter
fraud
is
almost
nonexistent
anymore.
however,
in
the
less
metropolitan
counties
of
california,
we
don’t
have
such
sophisticated
equipment
as
voting
machines
where
you
go
in
and
apparently
you
pull
levers
and
then
you
pull
the
arm
at
one
end
just
like
working
in
the
one
--
i
hate
to
use
the
analogy,
but
like
one
arm
bandit
in
nevada,
we
don’t
have
that.
we
have
a
little
marker
that
has
little
x
that
we
go
in
and
we
press
in
different
little
spots
with
our
own
hand.
in
footnote
26,
respondents
argued
that
even
though
california
says
that
any
person
who
is
elector
under
section
275
of
the
government
code
says
any
elector
in
state
of
california
is
entitled
the
hold
office.
they
say
that
its
fine
because
under
our
present
system
of
politics
throughout
the
nation
as
well
as
throughout
california,
a
person
who
would
have
a
felony
conviction
that
would
easilably
--
easily
found
and
i’d
like
to
set
that
aside
for
a
minute
because
in
my
county
disregarding
nine
justice
court
judges
and
two
superior
court
judges,
there
are
11
elected
officials.
at
the
last
election,
only
two
of
those
11
had
any
opposition
to
office.
the
two
that
did
was
the
sheriff
and
the
treasurer,
none
of
the
others
did
and
there
was
no
way
for
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
throughout
california,
many
elected
officials
occasionally
do
have
opposition
and
there
is
basically
no
way
to
find
out
if
a
man
had
been
convicted
of
felony
because
in
california
under
section
1203.4,
i
believe
or
the
1203.3
of
the
california
penal
code
are
record
to
be
expunged
and
a
person
no
longer
is
checking
a
box
that
says,
“yes,
i
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony.”
they
can
now
say,
"no"
and
so
they
talk
about
it’s
easy
to
discover
and
we
submit
that
it’s
not
as
easy
as
they
would
let
it
to
be
represented
to
be.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
one
of
the
questions
that
was
asked
a
few
minutes
ago
was
whether
or
not
there
was
statute,
a
federal
statute
that
went
along
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
what
i’d
like
to
bring
to
attention
of
the
court
is
2
us
code
section
6
which
is
a
restatement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
2
which
provides
for
the
disenfranchise.
it
says
you
can
abridge
--
you
cannot
abridge
except
for
crime
or
rebellion
and
i
do
not
have
the
legislative
history
to
say
when
that
section
was
passed,
but
i
would
assume
that
at
the
time
the
us
code
section
was
passed
that
they
were
not
under
the
pressures
that
mr.
glick
refers
to.
i'd
also
like
to
comment
to
the
court
that
in
reviewing
the
history
of
the
constitution,
it
was
interesting
to
read
some
of
the
comments
that
occurred
during
the
arguments
or
hearings
on
the
fifteenth
amendment.
during
the
course
of
the
hearings
on
the
fifteenth
amendment,
there
were
quite
a
number
of
proposed
amendments
which
included
exactly
the
same
language
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
except
for
crime
or
other
rebellion.
and
i
would
submit
that,
as
i
believe
it
was
willard
warner,
a
representative
from
this
state
of
alabama
indicated
that
it
would
seemed
that
the
states
should
have
the
right
under
that
small
limited
classification
to
accept
from
those
persons
the
right
to
vote.
we
submit
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
applied
because
this
constitutes
an
exception
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
section
2
clearly
says,
except
for
rebellion
or
other
crime
when
they’re
talking
about
the
reduction
in
the
representation.
now,
the
equal
protection
clause
seems
to
act
as
a
protection
to
avoid
what
the
last
part
of
section
2
says
that
if
you
deny
the
right
to
vote
then
we’re
going
to
reduce
your
representation
and
what
the
equal
protection
clause
is
saying,
at
least,
i
believe
it
says
is,
"no,
we
don’t
want
to
do
that."
the
state
is
entitled
to
a
full
representation.
so
if
you
disenfranchise
a
male
inhabit
30
years
old,
we’re
going
to
say
that
because
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
because
of
the
twenty-sixth
amendment,
this
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
so,
i
submit
that
although
in
california
maybe
as
applied,
there
it
is
an
unequal
application.
it
is
not
a
denial
of
the
states
of
right
to
disenfranchise.
we
have
heard
about
all
these
people
who
go
through
the
--
or
who
don’t
want
to
vote
or
who
are
afraid
to
go
register
to
vote
because
of
the
otsuka
decision.
but
yet
as
respondents
indicate,
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
34,000
plus
persons
were
released
from
state
person
from
1968
to
1971.
there
is
a
procedure
under
the
california
penal
code
to
get
a
certificate
of
rehabilitation
which
gets
back
for
you
when
you
go
through
the
administrative
judicial
process
and
up
to
government
to
get
the
right
to
vote
back
except
for
a
person
convicted
twice
separately.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
excuse
me?
mr.
duncan
m.
james
yes,
it
is
and
in
fact
it
provides
for
appointment
of
counsel.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
what?
mr.
duncan
m.
james
i
would
say
that
you
cannot
afford
counsel,
one
of
the
sections
in
the
48
--
4852
point
something
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
provides
for
appointment
to
the
public
defender
to
give
it
to
you,
to
go
through
the
court
of
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
he
hasn’t
--
he
is
only
done
once.
in
my
county
in
five
years
there
is
only
been
one
application
for
a
certificate
of
rehabilitation.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
well,
i
think
it’s
very
poor
[laughter]
because
the
procedure
is
there
yet
nobody
wants
to
go
through
it.
respondents
here
never
went
through
it.
there
is
no
indication
that
they
applied
and
were
rejected
by
the
governor.
in
the
same
period
of
time,
68
through
71,
only
450
filed
for
certificate
of
rehabilitation.
they’re
released
from
prison
that
they
are
entitled
to
go
through
that
procedure.
and
out
of
those
450
--
mr.
duncan
m.
james
that
is
right.
mr.
duncan
m.
james
that
is
correct.
it
was
just
--
the
procedure
is
there
in
available
for
those
who
want
to
use
franchise
to
go
through
the
certificate
of
rehabilitation,
and
almost
63%
of
those
that
did
apply
were
granted.
thank
you
very
much.
