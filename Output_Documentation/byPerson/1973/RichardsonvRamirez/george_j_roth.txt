mr.
george
j.
roth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
come
with
what
i
think
is
a
difficult
case
in
this
respect.
sociologically,
everything
is
against
our
position
in
california
because
of
the
otsuka
decision
is
unquestionably
true,
then
in
58
counties,
you
had
58
different
interpretations
of
what
was
an
infamous
crime.
historically,
there
is
no
question
that
a
compelling
state
interest
to
protect
the
ballot
box
is
no
longer
necessary
at
least
and
i
agree
with
what
the
respondents
have
set
forth.
but
the
one
thing
that
i
come
with
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
really
the
issue
here
is
to
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
take
an
area
of
the
constitution.
it’s
implied,
but
it’s
so
clearly
implied
that
it’s
almost
direct
and
say
that
this
court
will
say
that
sociologically,
it’s
good
and
consequently
we
should
say
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
this
particular
problem.
now,
as
i
see
it,
in
reading
the
many
pages
of
the
globe,
right
in
the
beginning,
everybody
who
ever
mentioned
the
problem,
except
for
rebellion
or
other
crimes,
did
so
in
a
matter
of
fact
way
because
that
was
the
accepted
tenure
of
the
time,
but
it
was
written
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unquestionably,
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
prevent
all
discrimination
because
of
grace.
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
question
of
that.
but
i
think
as
you
read
this,
to
the
people
who
worked
down
the
fourteenth
amendment
wanted
to
be
sure
that
the
states
still
would
have
a
little
bit
of
a
leverage
where
criminals
are
concerned.
now,
in
california,
we
don’t
say,
they
used
to
say
in
our
constitution
what
the
criminal
be
disenfranchised
forever,
and
our
constitution
is
now
changed.
justice
mosk
in
his
opinion
in
the
case
below
said
that
he
didn’t
think
that
was
too
important.
but
i
think
it
is
because
our
constitution
now
says
that
the
legislature
shall
pass
laws
which
will
disenfranchise
people
for
certain
purposes
and
among
those
purposes
named
are
perjury,
bribery,
malfeasance
in
office,
embezzlement
of
public
funds,
and
then
they
use
language
which
i
don’t
understand
anymore,
infamous
crime
and
high
crime.
if
this
court
rules
in
our
favor,
in
california,
we
will
be
back
in
the
position
that’s
true
that
we
were
at
the
time
of
the
otsuka
case
right
after
or
right
(inaudible)
well,
right
after.
it
will
be
in
a
confusion
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
that
is
exactly
our
position
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
state
legislates
you
can
resolve
that
position
by
defining
these
crimes
now
that
the
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
words
infamous
crime
and
high
crime
are
practically
undefinable
for
all
purposes
as
i
see
it
in
otsuka.
then,
they
went
on
to
say
that
our
constitution
was
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
j.
roth
it
might
your
honor.
our
court
is
a
very
activist
court.
i’d
like
to
think
they
are
about
two
weeks
ahead
of
this
court
and
they
create
problems.[attempt
to
laughter]
definition
wise,
i
think
if
the
definitions
were
specific,
why
this
--
if
this
court
upholds
the
constitutionality
of
the
principle,
i
don’t
know
what
our
court
would
do.
i
hope
they
would
rule
that
if
the
voters
change
the
constitution
or
if
the
legislature
acted
under
the
constitution,
i
hope
they
rule
if
they
were
correct.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
but
they
haven’t
done
it
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
oh
no,
i
believe
they
have
the
power
to
do
it
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
clear.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
question.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no.
the
court
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
there’s
three.
one
is
burglary,
one
is
forgery
and
one
man
was
convicted
of
the
possession
of
heroin.
mr.
george
j.
roth
correct.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
we
spoke
on
to
that
in
the
final
part
of
our
amicus
brief
and
that
is
the
idea
that
although
the
application
itself
as
it
exists
at
the
present
time
maybe
wrong
or
was
wrong
until
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
maybe
unconstitutional.
i
think
there’s
a
difference
between
the
application
and
what
the
california
supreme
court
or
the
california
legislature
may
do
to
make
it
constitutional
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
they
have
not.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
absolutely
not.
that’s
why
i
said
this
was
a
tough
case
besides
guarding.
but
i
think
that
the
accuracy
is
there.
i
think
most
of
the
historical
facts
is
no
problem
with,
but
it
is
a
problem
of
as
i
see
it,
letting
our
legislature
have
a
chance
to
do
something.
well,
let
our
state
supreme
court
do
something.
mr.
george
j.
roth
they
did,
but
they
didn’t
take
it.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
agree
heartedly
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
not
if
the
ground
was
that
there
was
no
definition,
no
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
that
is
right
if
you
say
we
have
it.
i
believe
we
have
it.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that’s
right.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that's
correct,
unless
we
amended
our
constitution,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
if
they
said
it
was,
and
then
we
amended
case
then
just
again,
we
might
possibly
get
a
decision
differently,
your
honor.
i
hopeful
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
i’d
rather
have
it
not,
your
honor.(attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
george
j.
roth
not
very
much,
your
honor.
and
i
know
the
court
does
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
that
is
true
and
then
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
only
to
the
extent
that
nationally,
this
court
should
rule
on
whether
or
not
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
separate
and
a
part
from
section
1
or
is
controlled
by
section
1.
mr.
george
j.
roth
it
could,
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that
is
right.
thank
you.
mr.
george
j.
roth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
come
with
what
i
think
is
a
difficult
case
in
this
respect.
sociologically,
everything
is
against
our
position
in
california
because
of
the
otsuka
decision
is
unquestionably
true,
then
in
58
counties,
you
had
58
different
interpretations
of
what
was
an
infamous
crime.
historically,
there
is
no
question
that
a
compelling
state
interest
to
protect
the
ballot
box
is
no
longer
necessary
at
least
and
i
agree
with
what
the
respondents
have
set
forth.
but
the
one
thing
that
i
come
with
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
really
the
issue
here
is
to
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
take
an
area
of
the
constitution.
it’s
implied,
but
it’s
so
clearly
implied
that
it’s
almost
direct
and
say
that
this
court
will
say
that
sociologically,
it’s
good
and
consequently
we
should
say
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
this
particular
problem.
now,
as
i
see
it,
in
reading
the
many
pages
of
the
globe,
right
in
the
beginning,
everybody
who
ever
mentioned
the

except
for
rebellion
or
other

did
so

a
matter
of
fact
way
because
that
was
the
accepted

of

but
it
was
written
into
the
fourteenth

unquestionably,
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
prevent
all
discrimination
because
of

i
don’t
think
there
is
any
question
of
that.
but
i
think
as
you
read
this,
to
the
people
who
worked
down
the
fourteenth

wanted
to
be
sure
that
the

now,
in

we
don’t
say,
they
used
to
say
in
our

what
the
criminal
be
disenfranchised
forever,
and
our
constitution
is
now
changed.
justice
mosk
in
his
opinion
in
the
case
below
said
that
he
didn’t
think
that
was
too
important.
but
i
think
it
is
because
our
constitution
now
says
that
the
legislature
shall
pass
laws
which
will
disenfranchise
people
for
certain
purposes
and
among
those
purposes
named
are
perjury,
bribery,
malfeasance
in
office,
embezzlement
of
public
funds,
and
then
they
use
language
which
i
don’t
understand
anymore,
infamous
crime
and
high
crime.
if
this
court
rules
in
our
favor,
in
california,
we
will
be
back
in
the
position
that’s
true
that
we
were
at
the
time
of
the
otsuka
case
right
after
or
right
(inaudible)
well,
right
after.
it
will
be
in
a
confusion
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
that
is
exactly
our
position
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
state
legislates
you
can
resolve
that
position
by
defining
these
crimes
now
that
the
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
words
infamous
crime
and
high
crime
are
practically
undefinable
for
all

as
i
see
it
in

then,
they
went

that

under
the
fourteenth

mr.
george
j.
roth
it

our
court
is
a
very
activist
court.
i’d
like
to
think
they
are
about
two
weeks
ahead
of
this
court
and
they
create
problems.[attempt
to

definition
wise,
i
think
if
the
definitions
were
specific,
why
this
--
if
this
court
upholds
the
constitutionality
of
the
principle,
i
don’t
know
what
our
court
would
do.
i
hope
they
would
rule
that
if
the
voters
change
the
constitution
or
if
the
legislature
acted
under
the
constitution,
i
hope
they
rule
if
they
were
correct.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
but
they
haven’t
done
it
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
oh
no,
i
believe
they
have
the
power
to
do
it
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
clear.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
sir.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no
question.
mr.
george
j.
roth
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no.
the
court
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
there’s
three.
one
is
burglary,
one
is
forgery
and
one
man
was
convicted
of
the
possession
of
heroin.
mr.
george
j.
roth
correct.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
we
spoke
on
to
that
in
the
final
part
of
our
amicus
brief
and
that
is
the
idea
that
although
the
application
itself
as
it
exists
at
the
present
time
maybe
wrong
or
was
wrong
until
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
maybe
unconstitutional.
i
think
there’s
a
difference
between
the
application
and
what
the
california
supreme
court
or
the
california
legislature
may
do
to
make
it
constitutional
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
they
have
not.
mr.
george
j.
roth
no,
absolutely
not.
that’s
why
i
said
this
was
a
tough
case
besides
guarding.
but
i
think
that
the
accuracy
is
there.
i
think
most
of
the
historical
facts
is
no
problem
with,
but
it
is
a
problem
of
as
i
see
it,
letting
our
legislature
have
a
chance
to
do
something.
well,
let
our
state
supreme
court
do
something.
mr.
george
j.
roth
they
did,
but
they
didn’t
take
it.
mr.
george
j.
roth
i
agree
heartedly
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
not
if
the
ground
was
that
there
was
no
definition,
no
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
well,
that
is
right
if
you
say
we
have
it.
i
believe
we
have
it.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that’s
right.
mr.
george
j.
roth
that's
correct,
unless
we
amended
our
constitution,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
roth
if
they
said
it
was,
and
then
we
amended
case
then
just
again,
we
might
possibly
get
a
decision
differently,
your
honor.
i
hopeful
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
i’d
rather
have
it
not,
your
honor.(attempt
to

mr.
george
j.
roth
not
very
much,
your
honor.
and
i
know
the
court
does
--
mr.
george
j.
roth
that
is
true
and
then
--
mr.
