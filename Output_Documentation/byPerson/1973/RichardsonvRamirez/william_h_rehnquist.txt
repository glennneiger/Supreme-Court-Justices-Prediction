you’d

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
get
around
the
supreme
court
of
california
decision
by
amending
the
california
constitution,
i
would
think
is
they
say
was
a
federal
constitutional
violation.
justice

could
that
be
because
of
this
provision
being
on

book?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
your
argument
(inaudible)
by
the
fact
that
though
the
expression
chosen
is
participation
in
crime
rather
than
conviction
of
crime
which
and
i
take
it
the
disqualifying
statutes
in
the
states
then
is
now
spoke
terms
of
conviction
rather
than
just
participation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
richardson
versus
ramirez,
the
three
individual
respondents
in
the
case
had
been
convicted
of
felonies
and
had
completed
the
service
of
their
sentences
and
paroles.
when
they
sought
to
register
to
vote,
county
election
officials
in
three
california
counties
in
which
they
resided,
refused
to
register
them
because
the
california
constitution
and
implementing
legislation
prohibited
voting
by
ex-felons.
the
individual
respondents
then
brought
this
mandamus
action
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
against
the
election
officials,
individually
and
as
representatives
of
the
class
of
all
such
election
officials.
they
claimed
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
all
other
ex-felon
similarly
situated
that
the
california
provisions
disenfranchising
ex-felons
denied
them
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
the
challenged
california
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
as
applied
to
ex-felons
whose
sentences
and
paroles
had
expired
did
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
reverse
that
holding.
we
hold
first
that
in
view
of
the
unusual
procedural
history
of
this
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
it
is
not
moot.
we
further
hold
that
the
california
does
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
by
disenfranchising
convicted
felons
who
have
completed
their
sentences
and
paroles.
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
contains
the
equal
protection
clause
could
not
have
been
meant
to
bar
outright
the
disenfranchisement
of
felons
when
their
disenfranchisement
is

2
of

from
