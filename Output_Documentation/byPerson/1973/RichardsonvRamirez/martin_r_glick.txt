mr.
martin
r.
glick
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
represent
abram
ramirez,
eric
gill
and
albert
sang
lee
and
other
persons
in
california
who
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
who
served
their
term
in
prison
and
successfully
completed
their
parole
in
many
cases
in
many
years
ago
successfully
completed
that
parole.
now
that
they
have
been
reintegrated
into
society,
they
seek
their
right
to
participate
on
an
equal
basis
in
the
election
process
in
california.
as
has
been
evident
here,
california
has
completely
fenced
them
out
of
the
election
process,
but
there
has
not
been
suggested
any
reason
why
there’s
any
state
interest
for
having
completely
fenced
them
out
of
the
process.
we
were
aware
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
and
the
persons
they
represent,
your
honor,
of
course,
who
would
not
been
permitted
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
their
their
prior
conviction
in
spite
of
their
having
served
their
term,
and
have
been
released
on
parole.
your
honors,
we
were
aware
that
that
their
would
be
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
were
specific,
(inaudible)
specific
who
limited
only
to
those
persons
who
were
completely
released
from
not
only
custody,
but
parole
as
well.
we
were
aware
your
honors
that
there
would
be
a
suggestion
that
perhaps
this
disability
should
continue
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
if
it’s
long
existence
and
so
although,
the
state
we
believe
did
not
justify
the
burdens
upon
it
to
come
forward
and
give
a
reasons
for
the
exclusion,
we
went
further
and
introduced
evidence
and
data
to
we
think
clearly
affirmatively
show
that
this
restriction
which
is
adopted
in
california’s
frontier
days
no
longer
make
any
sense.
as
is
discussed
in
our
briefs
and
as
has
been
almost
conceded
here,
well,
there
might
have
been
a
purpose
for
this
provision
in
1849
when
it
was
put
in
to
the
california
constitution
when
there
was
no
registration,
when
ballots
were
not
uniform
and
they
could
be
obtained
from
party
headquarters,
and
the
ballot
box
itself
was
in
1850
simply
a
box
that
was
formally
some
other
sort
of
the
container.
in
san
francisco
and
los
angeles,
that
was
the
situation.
in
pelayho
(ph)
was
reported
that
ballot
box
itself
was
an
old
cracker
box
which
had
a
hole
in
the
back
of
it,
it
was
discovered
years
later
through
which
ballots
could
be
slipped.
and
so,
the
framers
in
the
california
constitution
had
good
reason
to
be
concerned
about
the
integrity
of
the
election
process
and
i
think
that
concern
was
reflected
by
this
exclusion
in
the
constitution,
but
the
process
in
california
today
could
not
be
more
different.
65%
of
our
counties
do
vote
by
machine,
but
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter
and
the
other
35
counties,
of
course
there’s
registration.
they
are
uniform
ballots
with
special
water
marks,
but
precincts
are
limited
to
a
small
number
of
voters
per
precinct.
the
precinct
officials
are
residents
of
the
precincts.
they
know
the
voters
who
are
there
and
the
california
supreme
court
in
reviewing
the
scheme
concluded
that
the
practice
election,
violation
election
fraud.
election
problems
in
california
today
would
require
the
coordinated
skills
of
a
vast
squadron
of
computer
technicians.
in
other
words,
they
found
it
was
virtually
impossible
and
the
statistics
in
california
is
unmistakably
set
out
in
that
opinion
are
that
there
has
not
been
a
reported
case
of
vote
buying
or
vote
selling
in
california
since
1908.
the
last
reported
violation
in
los
angeles
county
which
has
a
third
approximately
a
third
of
california’s
voters,
the
last
complaint
of
any
voter
problem
was
in
1926
and
the
head
of
the
bureau
of
criminals
statistics
in
california
which
has
been
in
that
position
for
18
years
stated
that
not
one
single
election
offense
had
been
reported
to
him.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that’s
why
we
were
quite
careful,
your
honor,
to
point
out
not
only
that
there
haven’t
been
any,
although
we
would
suggest
there
would
be
some
first
offender
surely,
but
that
given
the
way
the
system
operates,
it’s
virtually
impossible
that
there
would
be
any.
in
other
words,
not
only
hasn’t
there
been
in
reality
a
danger,
but
the
system
is
such
that
the
danger
is
simply
not
present
of
fraud
occurring.
so,
we
want
to
take
care
of
both
of
those
parts
of
it.
this
change
in
the
election
process
was
paralleled
by
change
in
california’s
penal
code.
in
1850,
when
our
constitution
was
adopted
in
california,
there
were
only
8
misdemeanor
offenses
in
the
statutes
dealing
with
election
violations.
at
that
the
time
this
case
was
decided,
there
were
over
a
150
such
statutes
on
the
books,
including
76
felonies,
covering
such
things
as
fraudulent
registration,
voting
twice,
bribery,
intimidation
and
the
like.
so,
that
the
california
supreme
court
contrasting
that
situation
with
the
situation
which
this
court
in
dunn
versus
blumstein
found
adequate
to
deter
against
elections
fraud
as
reasonable
means
to
deal
with
that
problem,
found
that
if
anything,
our
situation
was
even
more
of
a
protection.
further
as
is
noted
in
the
record,
at
the
time
that
i
am
standing
before
you
this
keeps
changing,
but
at
the
time
i’m
standing
before
you
now,
26
of
the
states
either
never
disfranchise
at
all
or
automatically
restore
the
right
to
vote
upon
the
completion
of
sentence
and
either
a
parole
or
probationary
type
period
after
the
sentence.
the
district
of
columbia
does
the
same,
according
to
an
act
of
congress
which
i
believe
was
passed
in
1971,
and
of
course,
some
california
counties
under
otsuka
did
not
disqualify
practically
anybody,
had
not
disqualified
anybody
and
these
states,
the
district
of
columbia,
these
counties
have
not
reported
any
difficulties
with
their
election
process,
any
parade
of
horribles
or
in
fact,
any
problem
at
all
in
having
re-enfranchised.
your
honor,
before
passing,
i
want
to
show
you
all
parts
for
the
case,
i
wanted
to
emphasize
that
there
is
perhaps
present
here,
an
unstated
state
interest
if
you
will.
an
implication
that
perhaps
if
someone’s
convicted
of
a
crime
that
this
evidence
is
anti-social
behavior
or
an
evidence
of
some
inference
of
moral
and
fitness
or
something
of
the
kind,
and
therefore,
this
person
should
not
vote.
it’s
mentioned
i
think,
almost
explicitly
in
some
of
the
lower
court
decisions.
i'd
want
to
point
out
number
one
that
in
this
record,
there
is
not
evidence
or
whatever,
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
fact
that
such
an
inference
can
properly
be
drawn
as
to
any
of
these
persons
let
alone
as
to
all
of
them.
in
this
country
and
i
think
the
strength
of
the
country
is
that
we’ve
never
limited
the
franchise
to
persons
not
as
to
whom
an
inference
is
required,
but
to
whom
openly
and
a
validly
claim
we
should
have
an
entirely
different
system
of
government
or
no
system
or
whatsoever.
these
persons
aren’t
barred
from
the
franchise.
these
persons
in
fact
are
permitted
to
organize
political
parties
and
run
candidates
for
office,
let
alone
vote
and
this
court
i
think
in
reviewing
the
voting
cases,
well
first
in
the
backstrom
case,
this
court
refused
to
allow
an
influence
to
be
drawn
from
a
prior
conviction
such
that
a
different
process
for
commitment
for
mental
illness
would
be
permitted.
the
carrington
and
that
cipriano
and
the
bond
cases
in
evans
where
a
claim
was
maybe
because
persons
living
in
the
national
institute
of
health
because
persons
were
in
the
military,
they
might
vote
in
a
certain
manner,
their
might
block
voting
and
harmful
voting,
this
court
said
that
we
all
think
such
inferences
are
proper.
secondly
the
sheer
over
breath
of
drawing
such
broad
inferences
as
to
the
entire
class
would
not
be
permitted
especially
when
we
are
talking
about
voting.
and
finally
again
i
would
emphasize,
your
honor,
that
we
are
talking
about
persons
who
have
completed
the
term
in
prison,
whatever
inferences
might
have
been
drawn
during
the
period
there,
the
state
is
rehabilitating,
is
dealing
with
them.
they
have
completed,
successfully
completed
and
have
been
released
from
their
parole.
they
reintegrated
into
the
society.
they
are
active
citizens
and
as
to
them
continuing
to
draw
this
inference
years
later
which
we
do
not
believe
would
be
proper
even
in
the
first
instance
we
think
would
not
be
justified.
in
fact
to
the
contrary
--
the
real
state
interest
is
present
in
this
case
is
the
interest
of
rehabilitation.
the
entire
penal
system
is
aimed
at
returning
persons
to
a
productive
role
in
society
and
yet
yet
the
time
of
their
return,
at
the
time
when
the
state
has
passed
this
judgment
as
to
release
from
parole,
they’re
screened
out
at
the
most
important
right
or
one
of
most
important
rights,
the
fundamental
right
to
vote,
fundamental
because
not
only
in
itself
because
it
leads
to
all
other
rights.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
no,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
it
when
the
right
to
vote
or
the
right
to
participate
in
the
election
process
on
an
equal
basis
is
denied
to
citizens,
the
state
is
to
come
forward
and
demonstrate
what
interest
it
has
that
its
furthering
by
screening
these
people
out
of
the
voting
process.
now
they
have
suggested,
perhaps
integrity
of
the
election
process
in
terms
fraud.
the
attorney
general
as
just
stated
that
that
problem
doesn’t
exist
in
california.
the
california
court
found
so.
i
wanted
before
passing
on
to
deal
with
this
sort
of
implication
that
perhaps
that
there
was
some
other
state
interest
called
moral
unfitness
or
something
of
that
description
and
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
not
permitted
those
sort
inference
that
--
and
simply
to
dispel
the
notion
and
the
comment
that
they’re
--
perhaps
you’re
right,
your
honor,
but
there
is
this
other
state
interest
that
is
present,
it’s
the
one
of
rehabilitation
which
the
president's
commissions,
the
vice
president's
commissions
and
the
aba
and
the
other
organizations
have
urged.
let
me
then
take
--
consider
section
2
because
i
think
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
virtual
concession
that
there
is
no
state
interest
to
deny
the
right.
but
an
argument
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
nevertheless
renders
section
1
inoperable
and
the
words
that
are
relied
on
in
this
case
are
the
words
participation
and
rebellion
or
other
crime
which
are
found
in
section
2.
now,
i’ve
of
course
reviewed
the
legislative
history
and
i’ve
read
the
many
articles
that
have
been
written
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
i
believe
39th
congress
which
adopted
this
and
there
is
clearly
in
reading
there
are
no
one
view
as
to
no
one
purpose
of
all
of
the
persons
who
were
working
on
putting
that
amendment
together.
but
we
would
suggest
that
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
first
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
participation
or
rebellion
or
other
crime
is
really
meant
the
deal
with
the
problem
of
the
rebellion
and
not
the
problem
of
former
conviction.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
and
that’s
all.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
exactly.
yes,
we
will
conclude
that
for
two
or
three
reasons.
first
that
--
in
one
looks
of
the
purpose
of
section
2,
it
was
a
penalty
provision
to
deal
with
the
increase
in
representation
that
would
occur
because
the
emancipation
of
the
slight
was
not
being
counted
as
a
full
vote,
instead
of
3/5
of
the
vote,
this
was
required
under
article
i,
section
ii
and
so
the
penalty
provision
was
needed
to
deal
with
that
situation.
but
boarder
states
as
is
indicated
in
the
history,
were
concerned
that
they
have
just
disfranchised
large
numbers
of
rebels.
so
that
if
the
penalty
provisions
were
simply
put
in
the
way
it
was
originally
phrased,
they
might
lose
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
account
of
having
disfranchised
these
persons
who
participated
in
the
rebellion.
thus,
this
language
relating
to
the
rebellion
came
in
and
we
suggest
that
was
the
purpose,
looking
at
section
iii
again
which
deals
with
the
right
of
former
office
holders
who
participated
in
the
rebellion
to
once
again
become
office
holders,
indicates
once
again
that
the
rebellion
was
of
the
primary
concern
of
the
drafters.
the
phrase
other
crime
itself
is
quite
broad.
it
would
clearly
within
its
scope
and
encompasses
felonies,
misdemeanors
and
other
crimes
which
no
state
at
time
was
disqualifying
persons
for,
certainly
infamous
crime
is
certainly
well
known
to
framers
might
have
been
used.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
first
draft
--
there
were
no
were
no
reference
to
other
crime
at
all
and
that
was
added
later
and
there
are
some
dispute
about
when
common
exactly
was
added
but
i
do
not
--
as
i
read
that
the
history
is
simply
does
not
aid
us
very
much
in
terms
of
discuss.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
there
was
no
statute
that
i’m
aware
your
honor,
that
read
precisely
in
this
fashion.
the
state
statute
is
either
referred
to
infamous
crimes.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
no,
your
honor.
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
we
would
not
rest
there
of
course
your
honor.
we
believe
that
that
is
the
--
that
looking
at
the
history
and
what
was
intended
and
that’s
the
appropriate
reading
of
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
or
the
crime,
but
even
if,
but
even
if
the
phrase
was
meant
to
refer
not
just
to
other
crimes
but
to
felony
convictions
or
infamous
crimes
rather
than
other
crimes,
again,
one
looks
at
the
purpose
of
the
section.
the
emancipated
--
well,
it’s
clear
from
reading
of
the
history
that
they
intended
to
put
the
southern
states
to
a
choice,
either
emancipate,
either
enfranchise
the
persons
who
have
been
emancipated
or
suffer
a
reduction
in
your
congressional
representation
by
not
being
allowed
to
count
them
at
all.
that
this
was
the
purpose
and
that
in
devising
a
formula
to
accomplish
this
penalty,
they
simply
placed
in
the
clause
those
restrictions;
some
of
the
restrictions
that
were
generally
in
effect
at
that
time.
there
is
not
any
evidence
in
the
debate
that
there
was
any
discussion
whatsoever
or
what
would
or
would
not
be
appropriate
voter
qualifications.
why
these
were
put
in
and
some
others
were
omitted
or
any
discussion
that
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
an
attempt
or
there
was
any
intent
here
to
make
decisions
about
these
matters,
but
what
i
think
does
follow
logically
from
the
history
is
that
they
wanted
to
accomplish
the
penalty
and
so
they
need
the
state
in
general
broad
terms
to
protect
the
status
quo
if
you
will
in
the
north
especially
so
that
there
would
be
no
change
between
those
states,
they
simply
state
those
--
statement
of
those
qualifications
and
then
accomplish
the
penalty
purpose.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
yes,
your
honor,
yes
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
the
majority
of
the
state
perhaps
even
close
to
three
quarters
of
the
states
did
have
in
their
statutes
voter
qualifications
that
would
restrict
the
franchise
from
those
who
had
been
convicted
of
infamous
crimes,
that's
the
general
phraseology
at
the
time.
some
states
however
do
not.
of
course,
there
are
many
other
voter
qualifications
that
existed
such
as
property
qualifications
which
i
think
were
even
more
uniform
in
their
appearance
in
state
constitutions.
and
again,
i
think
this
from
the
simple
listing
here
which
is
not
at
all
inclusive
listing
that
and
with
no
discussion
of
the
what
should
and
should
not
appear
there
that
it
would
be
and
just
one
says
could
not
conclude
that
was
the
intent
and
at
this
court
i
believe
quite
property
in
prior
cases
has
refused
to
read
section
2
which
was
intended
as
a
penalty
as
entirely
preempting
section
1
as
was
the
argument
before
this
court
for
sometime.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
yes,
i
think
it
does
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
indicates
what
they
were
concerned
about.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
well,
your
honor,
of
course
it
is
a
manner
of
interpretation
and
there
is
no
clear
answer
and
i
wouldn’t
suggest
that
there
is.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
by
virtue
of
board
phraseology
of
the
crime,
by
virtue
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor
because
i
think
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
i
am
sorry.
i
think
in
this
context,
it
means
other
crimes
related
to
the
rebellion.
i
think
they
would
have
chosen
the
term
infamous
crime
if
that's
what
they
meant.
i
don’t
that
that
was
--
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
discussed
it.
i
do
not
think
that’s
what
they
meant.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
no,
i
want
to
be
quite
fair.
it
certainly
could
be.
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
best
reading
of
the
language,
but
it
is
clearly
open
to
your
interpretation.
it
seems
to
that
the
phraseology
chosen,
the
history
indicates
the
concern
for
the
rebellion,
not
the
any
other
concern
that
the
more
consistent
reading
of
it
with
that
history
is
that
it
did
not
intend
to
embrace
it.
but
again,
if
i
might
emphasize
to
the
court,
i
believe
that
either
reading
which
the
court
would
give
to
it
would
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
which
petitioners
urge
that
the
penalty
provision
here
which
was
the
clear
intent
of
section
2
should
be
read
as
modifying
or
nullifying
as
has
been
argued
previously
and
objected
in
this
court,
that
the
scope
is
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
we
believe
so
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
correct.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that
is
correct
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
your
honor,
we
think
there
are
significant
differences
in
the
person
who
is
in
prison
and
i
think
it
would
depend
on
how
those
--
and
the
facts
in
that
case
and
in
that
particular
state
were
set
out,
but
let
me
point
out
that
some
of
those
differences.
of
course,
the
person
in
prison
is
under
24-hour
confinement
and
under
a
fairly
regimented
control
of
the
state.
not
only
of
the
state
but
i
think
studies
have
indicated
that
other
inmates,
there’s
a
society
of
other
inmates
and
certain
influences
that
might
be
exerted
in
the
prison
context
which
may
or
may
not
a
present
dangers
to
the
ballot
box.
there’s
of
course
problems
of
access
to
information
to
cast
an
intelligent
ballot
which
is
clearly
a
state
interest.
there
might
be
again
taking
the
particular
state
and
the
particular
facts
difficulty
in
conducting
the
election
in
prison
or
dealing
with
the
election
in
prison.
and
of
course,
the
state
has
wide
latitude
in
its
effort
towards
the
rehabilitation,
in
the
conduct
of
its
programs
behind
prison
walls
and
so
we
would
suggest
there
are
many,
many
differences
in
that
case
which
again
one
would
need
to
look
at
the
facts
in
the
particular
state
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that’s
correct
your
honor,
and
there
was
no
dispute
about
that
below
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
i
think
in
fairness
your
honor,
it
was
pointed
out
over
and
over
again
at
the
beginning
and
the
state
came
forward
to
emphasis
the
fact
that
this
case
simply
doesn’t
involve
the
issue.
all
of
these
petitioners
are
prisoners
who
successfully
completed
their
parole.
petitioner
ramirez
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that
is
right,
and
petitioner
ramirez
successfully
completed
his
parole
20
years
ago.
he's
only
been
incarcerated
for
three
months
to
begin
with.
finally
your
honor,
the
court
has
already
commented
through
its
questions,
i
believe
on
second,
we
believe
to
be
independent
ground
on
which
this
court
could
and
should
sustain
the
decision
of
california
supreme
court
and
that
is
the
fact
where
one
resided
was
the
determinant
of
whether
one
could
vote.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
perhaps,
i
should
have
been
more
clear
your
honor.
i
think
that
for
california’s
purposes,
that
question
needs
to
be
reached.
what
i
was
asserting
is
that
even
if,
obviously
we
don’t
believe
the
court
should,
even
if
the
court
should
decide
adversely
to
us
on
the
issue
of
former
felons
who
have
been
released
from
prison
and
parole
voting,
that
nevertheless
the
california
scheme
is
unconstitutional
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
precisely.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
precisely.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
since
the
question
is
a
federal
question
since
it
was
fully
argued
before
the
court
below,
it
is
the
question
that
rises
solely
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
it
arises
solely.
they
did
decide
under
the
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
they
did
decide
your
honor
respectfully
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
were
violations.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
they
certainly
did
not
base
their
decision
on
the
discussion
of
that.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
i
recognize
your
honor
that
this
court
clearly
has
wide
latitude
to
deal
with
the
problem.
i
would
only
suggest
that
it
is
a
federal
question
that
was
fully
presented
to
the
court
and
could
be
resolved
by
this
court.
i
believe
that
the
court
from
my
understanding
is
fully
acquainted
with
the
facts
in
regard
to
argument,
so
thank
you
very
much
and
respectfully
--
oh,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
there's
a
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
your
honor,
i
would
only
point
out
that
the
three
petitions
--
three
named
petitioners
in
this
case
are
now
registered.
they
have
voted.
they
obviously
had
the
consent
to
vote.
they
would
be
--
i
need
not
to
my
point
out
certainly
disappointed
if
it
came
back
to
california
supreme
court
for
another
reading
and
we
feel
that
there
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
here
to
them
under
the
california
scheme,
that
there
was
a
denial
and
at
the
state,
there’s
simply
no
state
interest
has
been
advanced
that
suggests
that
this
disqualification
in
california
today
makes
any
sense.
so,
we
would
urge
the
affirmance
of
that
decision.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
represent
abram
ramirez,
eric
gill
and
albert
sang
lee
and
other
persons
in
california
who
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
who
served
their
term
in
prison
and
successfully
completed
their
parole
in
many
cases
in
many
years
ago
successfully
completed
that
parole.
now
that
they
have
been
reintegrated
into
society,
they
seek
their
right
to
participate
on
an
equal
basis
in
the
election
process
in
california.
as
has
been
evident
here,
california
has
completely
fenced
them
out
of
the
election
process,
but
there
has
not
been
suggested
any
reason
why
there’s
any
state
interest
for
having
completely
fenced
them
out
of
the
process.
we
were
aware
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
and
the
persons
they
represent,
your
honor,
of
course,
who
would
not
been
permitted
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
their
their
prior
conviction
in
spite
of
their
having
served
their
term,
and
have
been
released
on
parole.
your
honors,
we
were
aware
that
that
their
would
be
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
were
specific,
(inaudible)
specific
who
limited
only
to
those
persons
who
were
completely
released
from
not
only
custody,
but
parole
as
well.
we
were
aware
your
honors
that
there
would
be
a
suggestion
that
perhaps
this
disability
should
continue
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
if
it’s
long
existence
and
so
although,
the
state
we
believe
did
not
justify
the
burdens
upon
it
to
come
forward
and
give
a
reasons
for
the
exclusion,
we
went
further
and
introduced
evidence
and
data
to
we
think
clearly
affirmatively
show
that
this
restriction
which
is
adopted
in
california’s
frontier
days
no
longer
make
any
sense.
as
is
discussed
in
our
briefs
and
as
has
been
almost
conceded
here,
well,
there
might
have
been
a
purpose
for
this
provision
in
1849
when
it
was
put
in
to
the
california
constitution
when
there
was
no
registration,
when
ballots
were
not
uniform
and
they
could
be
obtained
from
party
headquarters,
and
the
ballot
box
itself
was
in
1850
simply
a
box
that
was
formally
some
other
sort
of
the
container.
in
san
francisco
and
los
angeles,
that
was
the
situation.
in
pelayho
(ph)
was
reported
that
ballot
box
itself
was
an
old
cracker
box
which
had
a
hole
in
the
back
of
it,
it
was
discovered
years
later
through
which
ballots
could
be
slipped.
and
so,
the
framers
in
the
california
constitution
had
good
reason
to
be
concerned
about
the
integrity
of
the
election
process
and
i
think
that
concern
was
reflected
by
this
exclusion
in
the
constitution,
but
the
process
in
california
today
could
not
be
more
different.
65%
of
our
counties
do
vote
by
machine,
but
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter
and
the
other
35
counties,
of
course
there’s
registration.
they
are
uniform
ballots
with
special
water
marks,
but
precincts
are
limited
to
a
small
number
of
voters
per
precinct.
the
precinct
officials
are
residents
of
the
precincts.
they
know
the
voters
who
are
there
and
the
california
supreme
court
in
reviewing
the
scheme
concluded
that
the
practice
election,
violation
election
fraud.
election
problems
in
california
today
would
require
the
coordinated
skills
of
a
vast
squadron
of
computer
technicians.
in
other
words,
they
found
it
was
virtually
impossible
and
the
statistics
in
california
is
unmistakably
set
out
in
that
opinion
are
that
there
has
not
been
a
reported
case
of
vote
buying
or
vote
selling
in
california
since
1908.
the
last
reported
violation
in
los
angeles
county
which
has
a
third
approximately
a
third
of
california’s
voters,
the
last
complaint
of
any
voter
problem
was
in
1926
and
the
head
of
the
bureau
of
criminals
statistics
in
california
which
has
been
in
that
position
for
18
years
stated
that
not
one
single
election
offense
had
been
reported
to
him.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that’s
why
we
were
quite
careful,
your
honor,
to
point
out
not
only
that
there
haven’t
been
any,
although
we
would
suggest
there
would
be
some
first
offender
surely,
but
that
given
the
way
the
system
operates,
it’s
virtually
impossible
that
there
would
be
any.
in
other
words,
not
only
hasn’t
there
been
in
reality
a
danger,
but
the
system
is
such
that
the
danger
is
simply
not
present
of
fraud
occurring.
so,
we
want
to
take
care
of
both
of
those
parts
of
it.
this
change
in
the
election
process
was
paralleled
by
change
in
california’s
penal
code.
in
1850,
when
our
constitution
was
adopted
in
california,
there
were
only
8
misdemeanor
offenses
in
the
statutes
dealing
with
election
violations.
at
that
the
time
this
case
was
decided,
there
were
over
a
150
such
statutes
on
the
books,
including
76
felonies,
covering
such
things
as
fraudulent
registration,
voting
twice,
bribery,
intimidation
and
the
like.
so,
that
the
california
supreme
court
contrasting
that
situation
with
the
situation
which
this
court
in
dunn
versus
blumstein
found
adequate
to
deter
against
elections
fraud
as
reasonable
means
to
deal
with
that
problem,
found
that
if
anything,
our
situation
was
even
more
of
a
protection.
further
as
is
noted
in
the
record,
at
the
time
that
i
am
standing
before
you
this
keeps
changing,
but
at
the
time
i’m
standing
before
you
now,
26
of
the
states
either
never
disfranchise
at
all
or
automatically
restore
the
right
to
vote
upon
the
completion
of
sentence
and
either
a
parole
or
probationary
type
period
after
the
sentence.
the
district
of
columbia
does
the
same,
according
to
an
act
of
congress
which
i
believe
was
passed
in
1971,
and
of
course,
some
california
counties
under
otsuka
did
not
disqualify
practically
anybody,
had
not
disqualified
anybody
and
these
states,
the
district
of
columbia,
these
counties
have
not
reported
any
difficulties
with
their
election
process,
any
parade
of
horribles
or
in
fact,
any
problem
at
all
in
having
re-enfranchised.
your
honor,
before
passing,
i
want
to
show
you
all
parts
for
the
case,
i
wanted
to
emphasize
that
there
is
perhaps
present
here,
an
unstated
state
interest
if
you
will.
an
implication
that
perhaps
if
someone’s
convicted
of
a
crime
that
this
evidence
is
anti-social
behavior
or
an
evidence
of
some
inference
of
moral
and
fitness
or
something
of
the
kind,
and
therefore,
this
person
should
not
vote.
it’s
mentioned
i
think,
almost
explicitly
in
some
of
the
lower
court
decisions.
i'd
want
to
point
out
number
one
that
in
this
record,
there
is
not
evidence
or
whatever,
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
fact
that
such
an
inference
can
properly
be
drawn
as
to
any
of
these
persons
let
alone
as
to
all
of
them.
in
this
country
and
i
think
the
strength
of
the
country
is
that
we’ve
never
limited
the
franchise
to
persons
not
as
to
whom
an
inference
is
required,
but
to
whom
openly
and
a
validly
claim
we
should
have
an
entirely
different
system
of
government
or
no
system
or
whatsoever.
these
persons
aren’t
barred
from
the
franchise.
these
persons
in
fact
are
permitted
to
organize
political
parties
and
run
candidates
for
office,
let
alone
vote
and
this
court
i
think
in
reviewing
the
voting
cases,
well
first
in
the
backstrom
case,
this
court
refused
to
allow
an
influence
to
be
drawn
from
a
prior
conviction
such
that
a
different
process
for
commitment
for
mental
illness
would
be
permitted.
the
carrington
and
that
cipriano
and
the
bond
cases
in
evans
where
a
claim
was
maybe
because
persons
living
in
the
national
institute
of
health
because
persons
were
in
the
military,
they
might
vote
in
a
certain
manner,
their
might
block
voting
and
harmful
voting,
this
court
said
that
we
all
think
such
inferences
are
proper.
secondly
the
sheer
over
breath
of
drawing
such
broad
inferences
as
to
the
entire
class
would
not
be
permitted
especially
when
we
are
talking
about
voting.
and
finally
again
i
would
emphasize,
your
honor,
that
we
are
talking
about
persons
who
have
completed
the
term
in
prison,
whatever
inferences
might
have
been
drawn
during
the
period
there,
the
state
is
rehabilitating,
is
dealing
with
them.
they
have
completed,
successfully
completed
and
have
been
released
from
their
parole.
they
reintegrated
into
the
society.
they
are
active
citizens
and
as
to
them
continuing
to
draw
this
inference
years
later
which
we
do
not
believe
would
be
proper
even
in
the
first
instance
we
think
would
not
be
justified.
in
fact
to
the
contrary
--
the
real
state
interest
is
present
in
this
case
is
the
interest
of
rehabilitation.
the
entire
penal
system
is
aimed
at
returning
persons
to
a
productive
role
in
society
and
yet
yet
the
time
of
their
return,
at
the
time
when
the
state
has
passed
this
judgment
as
to
release
from
parole,
they’re
screened
out
at
the
most
important
right
or
one
of
most
important
rights,
the
fundamental
right
to
vote,
fundamental
because
not
only
in
itself
because
it
leads
to
all
other
rights.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
no,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
it
when
the
right
to
vote
or
the
right
to
participate
in
the
election
process
on
an
equal
basis
is
denied
to
citizens,
the
state
is
to
come
forward
and
demonstrate
what
interest
it
has
that
its
furthering
by
screening
these
people
out
of
the
voting
process.
now
they
have
suggested,
perhaps
integrity
of
the
election
process
in
terms
fraud.
the
attorney
general
as
just
stated
that
that
problem
doesn’t
exist
in
california.
the
california
court
found
so.
i
wanted
before
passing
on
to
deal
with
this
sort
of
implication
that
perhaps
that
there
was
some
other
state
interest
called
moral
unfitness
or
something
of
that
description
and
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
not
permitted
those
sort
inference
that
--
and
simply
to
dispel
the
notion
and
the
comment
that
they’re
--
perhaps
you’re
right,
your
honor,
but
there
is
this
other
state
interest
that
is
present,
it’s
the
one
of
rehabilitation
which
the
president's
commissions,
the
vice
president's
commissions
and
the
aba
and
the
other
organizations
have
urged.
let
me
then
take
--
consider
section
2
because
i
think
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
virtual
concession
that
there
is
no
state
interest
to
deny
the
right.
but
an
argument
that
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
nevertheless
renders
section
1
inoperable
and
the
words
that
are
relied
on
in
this
case
are
the
words
participation
and
rebellion
or
other
crime
which
are
found
in
section
2.
now,
i’ve
of
course
reviewed
the
legislative
history
and
i’ve
read
the
many
articles
that
have
been
written
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
i
believe
39th
congress
which
adopted
this
and
there
is
clearly
in
reading
there
are
no
one
view
as
to
no
one
purpose
of
all
of
the
persons
who
were
working
on
putting
that
amendment
together.
but
we
would
suggest
that
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
first
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
participation
or
rebellion
or
other
crime
is
really
meant
the
deal
with
the
problem
of
the
rebellion
and
not
the
problem
of
former
conviction.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
and
that’s
all.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
exactly.
yes,
we
will
conclude
that
for
two
or
three
reasons.
first
that
--
in
one
looks
of
the
purpose
of
section
2,
it
was
a
penalty
provision
to
deal
with
the
increase
in
representation
that
would
occur
because
the
emancipation
of
the
slight
was
not
being
counted
as
a
full
vote,
instead
of
3/5
of
the
vote,
this
was
required
under
article
i,
section
ii
and
so
the
penalty
provision
was
needed
to
deal
with
that
situation.
but
boarder
states
as
is
indicated
in
the
history,
were
concerned
that
they
have
just
disfranchised
large
numbers
of
rebels.
so
that
if
the
penalty
provisions
were
simply
put
in
the
way
it
was
originally
phrased,
they
might
lose
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
account
of
having
disfranchised
these
persons
who
participated
in
the
rebellion.
thus,
this
language
relating
to
the
rebellion
came
in
and
we
suggest
that
was
the
purpose,
looking
at
section
iii
again
which
deals
with
the
right
of
former
office
holders
who
participated
in
the
rebellion
to
once
again
become
office
holders,
indicates
once
again
that
the
rebellion
was
of
the
primary
concern
of
the
drafters.
the
phrase
other
crime
itself
is
quite
broad.
it
would
clearly
within
its
scope
and
encompasses
felonies,
misdemeanors
and
other
crimes
which
no
state
at
time
was
disqualifying
persons
for,
certainly
infamous
crime
is
certainly
well
known
to
framers
might
have
been
used.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
first
draft
--
there
were
no
were
no
reference
to
other
crime
at
all
and
that
was
added
later
and
there
are
some
dispute
about
when
common
exactly
was
added
but
i
do
not
--
as
i
read
that
the
history
is
simply
does
not
aid
us
very
much
in
terms
of
discuss.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
there
was
no
statute
that
i’m
aware
your
honor,
that
read
precisely
in
this
fashion.
the
state
statute
is
either
referred
to
infamous
crimes.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
no,
your
honor.
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
we
would
not
rest
there
of
course
your
honor.
we
believe
that
that
is
the
--
that
looking
at
the
history
and
what
was
intended
and
that’s
the
appropriate
reading
of
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
or
the
crime,
but
even
if,
but
even
if
the
phrase
was
meant
to
refer
not
just
to
other
crimes
but
to
felony
convictions
or
infamous
crimes
rather
than
other
crimes,
again,
one
looks
at
the
purpose
of
the
section.
the
emancipated
--
well,
it’s
clear
from
reading
of
the
history
that
they
intended
to
put
the
southern
states
to
a
choice,
either
emancipate,
either
enfranchise
the
persons
who
have
been
emancipated
or
suffer
a
reduction
in
your
congressional
representation
by
not
being
allowed
to
count
them
at
all.
that
this
was
the
purpose
and
that
in
devising
a
formula
to
accomplish
this
penalty,
they
simply
placed
in
the
clause
those
restrictions;
some
of
the
restrictions
that
were
generally
in
effect
at
that
time.
there
is
not
any
evidence
in
the
debate
that
there
was
any
discussion
whatsoever
or
what
would
or
would
not
be
appropriate
voter
qualifications.
why
these
were
put
in
and
some
others
were
omitted
or
any
discussion
that
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
an
attempt
or
there
was
any
intent
here
to
make
decisions
about
these
matters,
but
what
i
think
does
follow
logically
from
the
history
is
that
they
wanted
to
accomplish
the
penalty
and
so
they
need
the
state
in
general
broad
terms
to
protect
the
status
quo
if
you
will
in
the
north
especially
so
that
there
would
be
no
change
between
those
states,
they
simply
state
those
--
statement
of
those
qualifications
and
then
accomplish
the
penalty
purpose.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
yes,
your
honor,
yes
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
the
majority
of
the
state
perhaps
even
close
to
three
quarters
of
the
states
did
have
in
their
statutes
voter
qualifications
that
would
restrict
the
franchise
from
those
who
had
been
convicted
of
infamous
crimes,
that's
the
general
phraseology
at
the
time.
some
states
however
do
not.
of
course,
there
are
many
other
voter
qualifications
that
existed
such
as
property
qualifications
which
i
think
were
even
more
uniform
in
their
appearance
in
state
constitutions.
and
again,
i
think
this
from
the
simple
listing
here
which
is
not
at
all
inclusive
listing
that
and
with
no
discussion
of
the
what
should
and
should
not
appear
there
that
it
would
be
and
just
one
says
could
not
conclude
that
was
the
intent
and
at
this
court
i
believe
quite
property
in
prior
cases
has
refused
to
read
section
2
which
was
intended
as
a
penalty
as
entirely
preempting
section
1
as
was
the
argument
before
this
court
for
sometime.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
yes,
i
think
it
does
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
indicates
what
they
were
concerned
about.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
well,
your
honor,
of
course
it
is
a
manner
of
interpretation
and
there
is
no
clear
answer
and
i
wouldn’t
suggest
that
there
is.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
by
virtue
of
board
phraseology
of
the
crime,
by
virtue
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor
because
i
think
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
i
am
sorry.
i
think
in
this
context,
it
means
other
crimes
related
to
the
rebellion.
i
think
they
would
have
chosen
the
term
infamous
crime
if
that's
what
they
meant.
i
don’t
that
that
was
--
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
discussed
it.
i
do
not
think
that’s
what
they
meant.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
no,
i
want
to
be
quite
fair.
it
certainly
could
be.
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
best
reading
of
the
language,
but
it
is
clearly
open
to
your
interpretation.
it
seems
to
that
the
phraseology
chosen,
the
history
indicates
the
concern
for
the
rebellion,
not
the
any
other
concern
that
the
more
consistent
reading
of
it
with
that
history
is
that
it
did
not
intend
to
embrace
it.
but
again,
if
i
might
emphasize
to
the
court,
i
believe
that
either
reading
which
the
court
would
give
to
it
would
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
which
petitioners
urge
that
the
penalty
provision
here
which
was
the
clear
intent
of
section
2
should
be
read
as
modifying
or
nullifying
as
has
been
argued
previously
and
objected
in
this
court,
that
the
scope
is
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
we
believe
so
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
correct.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that
is
correct
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
your
honor,
we
think
there
are
significant
differences
in
the
person
who
is
in
prison
and
i
think
it
would
depend
on
how
those
--
and
the
facts
in
that
case
and
in
that
particular
state
were
set
out,
but
let
me
point
out
that
some
of
those
differences.
of
course,
the
person
in
prison
is
under
24-hour
confinement
and
under
a
fairly
regimented
control
of
the
state.
not
only
of
the
state
but
i
think
studies
have
indicated
that
other
inmates,
there’s
a
society
of
other
inmates
and
certain
influences
that
might
be
exerted
in
the
prison
context
which
may
or
may
not
a
present
dangers
to
the
ballot
box.
there’s
of
course
problems
of
access
to
information
to
cast
an
intelligent
ballot
which
is
clearly
a
state
interest.
there
might
be
again
taking
the
particular
state
and
the
particular
facts
difficulty
in
conducting
the
election
in
prison
or
dealing
with
the
election
in
prison.
and
of
course,
the
state
has
wide
latitude
in
its
effort
towards
the
rehabilitation,
in
the
conduct
of
its
programs
behind
prison
walls
and
so
we
would
suggest
there
are
many,
many
differences
in
that
case
which
again
one
would
need
to
look
at
the
facts
in
the
particular
state
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that’s
correct
your
honor,
and
there
was
no
dispute
about
that
below
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
i
think
in
fairness
your
honor,
it
was
pointed
out
over
and
over
again
at
the
beginning
and
the
state
came
forward
to
emphasis
the
fact
that
this
case
simply
doesn’t
involve
the
issue.
all
of
these
petitioners
are
prisoners
who
successfully
completed
their
parole.
petitioner
ramirez
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
that
is
right,
and
petitioner
ramirez
successfully
completed
his
parole
20
years
ago.
he's
only
been
incarcerated
for
three
months
to
begin
with.
finally
your
honor,
the
court
has
already
commented
through
its
questions,
i
believe
on
second,
we
believe
to
be
independent
ground
on
which
this
court
could
and
should
sustain
the
decision
of
california
supreme
court
and
that
is
the
fact
where
one
resided
was
the
determinant
of
whether
one
could
vote.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
perhaps,
i
should
have
been
more
clear
your
honor.
i
think
that
for
california’s
purposes,
that
question
needs
to
be
reached.
what
i
was
asserting
is
that
even
if,
obviously
we
don’t
believe
the
court
should,
even
if
the
court
should
decide
adversely
to
us
on
the
issue
of
former
felons
who
have
been
released
from
prison
and
parole
voting,
that
nevertheless
the
california
scheme
is
unconstitutional
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
precisely.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
precisely.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
since
the
question
is
a
federal
question
since
it
was
fully
argued
before
the
court
below,
it
is
the
question
that
rises
solely
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
it
arises
solely.
they
did
decide
under
the
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
they
did
decide
your
honor
respectfully
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
were
violations.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
they
certainly
did
not
base
their
decision
on
the
discussion
of
that.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
i
recognize
your
honor
that
this
court
clearly
has
wide
latitude
to
deal
with
the
problem.
i
would
only
suggest
that
it
is
a
federal
question
that
was
fully
presented
to
the
court
and
could
be
resolved
by
this
court.
i
believe
that
the
court
from
my
understanding
is
fully
acquainted
with
the
facts
in
regard
to
argument,
so
thank
you
very
much
and
respectfully
--
oh,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
martin
r.
glick
there's
a
--
mr.
martin
r.
glick
your
honor,
i
would
only
point
out
that
the
three
petitions
--
three
named
petitioners
in
this
case
are
now
registered.
they
have
voted.
they
obviously
had
the
consent
to
vote.
they
would
be
--
i
need
not
to
my
point
out
certainly
disappointed
if
it
came
back
to
california
supreme
court
for
another
reading
and
we
feel
that
there
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
here
to
them
under
the
california
scheme,
that
there
was
a
denial
and
at
the
state,
there’s
simply
no
state
interest
has
been
advanced
that
suggests
that
this
disqualification
in
california
today
makes
any
sense.
so,
we
would
urge
the
affirmance
of
that
decision.
thank
you,
your
honor.
