rehnquist
mr.
fine,
was
cohen
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
holding
an
eisen
i
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
review
judge
tyler’s
original
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
security
for
cause
mr.
fine,
is
traditionally
when
the
costs
are
taxed
at
the
end
of
the
case,
expenditures
that
you
have
incurred
to
your
own
travel,
or
your
own
pay
to
a
court
reporter,
you
maybe
able
to
tax
against
the
opposite
party.
but
it
strikes
me
that
it's
similar
to
what
the
chief
justice
said,
this
isn’t
quite
the
same
thing
as
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fine,
as
a
procedural
practical
matter,
you
say
that
these
burdens
are
largely
assumed
by
accounting
firms
or
data
processing
firms.
how
are
they
compensated?
is
this
prior
to
final
judgment
or
afterwards?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
don’t
have
to
worry
about
it
until
either
you
have
agreed
on
a
settlement,
or
until
after
final
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
lose
your
antitrust
suit,
presumably
you
wouldn’t
put
out
a
business
by
those
defendants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that’s
the
way
we
resolve
those
questions.
if
a
jury
says
the
defendants
win,
the
plaintiffs
didn’t
have
an
antitrust?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
milburn,
why
isn’t
mr.
fine
right
on
the
$19,000.00
business
under
hickman
against
taylor?
that
if
you
want
to
raise
that
as
an
issue
on
appeal,
you
don’t
simply
pay
when
the
court
tells
you
to
pay.
you
go
to
jail
for
contempt
an
appeal
for
contempt
citation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
know
his
name,
but
can’t
find
his
address?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
jackson,
how
about
the
situation
where
you
want
to
take
someone’s
deposition
out
of
town
and
your
opponent
comes
in
and
says
“we
just
can’t,
we’re
poor.
we
can’t
afford.”
now
frequently,
a
court
will,
as
a
condition
to
allowing
a
deposition
that
they
will
require
the
defendant
to
advance
the
travel
cost
to
be
paid
by
plaintiff’s
attorney's
fees,
is
that
so
different
from
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
he
can
avoid
that
cost
by
simply
electing
to
proceed
individually?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
even
if
you
find
that
there
was
an
antitrust
violation,
the
damage
formulation
might
be
a
matter
of
difference
in
each
individual
case?
