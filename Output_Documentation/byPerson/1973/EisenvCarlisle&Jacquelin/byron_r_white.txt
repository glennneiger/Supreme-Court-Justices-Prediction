justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
fine,
he
explained
here
he
talked
about
the
--
has
such
a
small
claim
that
he
won’t
bother
to
file
at
all.
if
that’s
so,
just
his
silence
is
rather
an
insecure
insubstantial
way
of
saying
that
he’s
waived
his
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
he’s
made
an
assignment
to
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
look
at
this
case
as
a
(c)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
(b)
(2)?
justice
byron
r.
white
court
of
appeals
says
it
wasn’t.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
also
say
(b)
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
of
appeals
could
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
it’s
neither
1
or
2,
but
it
is
3.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
about
the
notice
requirements?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let’s
assume,
let’s
assume
that
it
isn’t.
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
you
must
look
at
it
as
a
(b)
(3)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn’t
the
rule
just
say
that
you
serve
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
read
that?
the
court
of
appeals
read
that
as
that
is
the
kind
of
notice
that
must
go
in
any
event?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
fine,
what
if
you
lose
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
here
talk
about
a
fund
then
once
we
win
the
case
then
we
can
give
people
notice.
what
if
you
lose?
the
people
you
didn’t
give
notice
to
are
barred.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
you
say
their
interests
are
substantial
enough
that
for
a
failure
to
respond
should
be
interpreted
as
a
waiver.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they’re
not
barred?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
notice
to
make
sure
that
they
have
a
chance
not
to
be
barred?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
always
have
a
chance
of
litigating
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
one
of
the,
maybe
names
of
amending
the
rules
as
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
to
bar
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it’s
right,
where
is
it
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
the
rule
really
didn’t
accomplish
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
you
lost
your
case
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
horrible
thought,
but
assume
you
lost
it,
what
about
--
what
about
the
cost
of
notice,
who’s
going
to
pay
for
all
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
they
be
passed
to
the
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
probably?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don’t
have
to
say
that
or
otherwise
you
would
have
to
put
up
the
bond?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
object
to
the
formula?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
you’re
objecting
to
a
formula?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
one,
the
district
court
arrived
at
one
which
you
denied,
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
disturb
it,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
opposition
talking
about
in
their
brief
when
it
says
“applying
the
formula
to
these
two
million?”
what
formula
is
he
referring
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
jackson,
i
take
it
that
even
if
there
isn’t
a
proper
class
of
six
million,
if
the
plaintiff
had
been
willing
to
put
up
costs
of
notice
and
accept
the
job
of
giving
notice
to
two
million
identifiable
people,
what
should
have
kept
that
class
action
from
going
forward,
if
the
plaintiff
had
been
willing
to
give
notice
and
pay
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would’ve
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
still
manageability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
so
inherently
difficult,
let’s
just
take
a
name
out
of
the
two
million,
now
what’s
so
inherently
difficult
about
figuring
out
what
that
one
person
is
claim
is,
or
in
deciding
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn’t
any
formula?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
more
than
likely,
but
he
didn’t
decide
what
the
formula
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
couldn’t
find
anything
on
the
a11
or
a212
that
would
