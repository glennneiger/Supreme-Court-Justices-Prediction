mr.
devereux
milburn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jackson
and
i,
mr.
jackson
represents
the
stock
exchange,
and
i
represent
the
odd-lot
houses,
are
dividing
our
time.
basically
equally
and
just
to
give
you
a
plan
on
what
we
intend
to
do,
i
will
deal
with
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
i
will
deal
with
the
question
of
expanding
and
correcting
some
of
the
facts.
i
will
deal
with
manageability
and
with
notice.
mr.
jackson
will
deal
with
the
substantive
aspects
of
rule
23.
he
will
deal
with
fluid
recovery,
mini-hearing,
and
the
costs
of
notice,
and
policy
considerations.
i
would
like
to
commence
with
arguing
briefly
as
to
jurisdiction,
which
was
requested
in
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
we
at
the
court
of
appeals,
had
jurisdiction.
mainly
because
we
have
had
from
us
extracted
a
sum
of
$19,000.00
or
it
is
intended
to
be
extracted
from
us
to
finance
a
case
against
ourselves,
and
if
we
are
successful
by
the
plaintiff’s
own
admission,
no
chance
of
recovering
it.
we
have
had
inflicted
upon
us
what
we
consider
an
illegal
and
unlawful
mini-hearing,
a
truncated
hearing
on
the
merits
prior
to
trial,
and
prior
to
jury
trial
which
we
have
requested.
we
have
been
subjected
to,
or
we
are
told
that
we
will
be
subjected
to
such
inadequate
notice
that
the
rights
of
the
class
will
be
denied,
that
res
judicata
will
be
denied
to
us,
that
the
chance
of
plaintiffs
is
opting
out,
plaintiff
members
or
the
plaintiff
class
opting
out
will
be
denied
to
us
because
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
notice.
we
have
also
seen
a
misconstruction
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
as
it
applies
to
the
odd-lot
houses
and
a
misconstruction
of
section
6
of
the
exchange
act
as
it
applies
to
the
stock
exchange.
we
submit
that
because
of
all
these
violent
actions
taken
by
judge
tyler
against
us
that
this
case
comes
clearly
under
the
doctrine
of
cohen
against
beneficial
loan.
cohen
said
that
when
matters
were
too
important
to
be
denied
review,
too
independent
to
require
postponement
until
the
whole
case
is
decided
that
they
should
be
adjudicated
at
the
time.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
i
think
that
that
is
a
possibility,
but
we
feel
that
we
have
a
right
under
the
cohen
doctrine
to
appeal
at
this
time,
and
i
would
find,
i
am
just
guessing,
that
my
clients
might
have
some
objection
to
following
the
course
you
suggest
and
maybe
going
to
jail
pending
on
appeal.
i
haven’t
discussed
it
with
him,
but
i’m
guessing.[laughter]
now,
i
would
like
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes,
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that
is
correct.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
devereux
milburn
your
honor,
we
stand
by
our
brief
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
case.
however,
in
this
case
if
judge
kaufman
is
reversed,
then
as
i
think
some
instead,
we
will
be
back
with
judge
tyler,
the
1966
judge
tyler
and
we
prefer
and
i
think
one
could
assume
from
what’s
happened
since
that
judge
tyler
might,
as
he
is
permitted
to
by
the
rule,
he
might
change
his
opinion.
and
he
might
reinstate
tyler
ii,
as
i
call
it,
and
tyler
ii
(a).
now,
looking
at
the
opinions
in
the
en
banc
decision
and
what
is
gone,
the
water
that
has
gone
under
the
bridge,
i
cannot
see
how
we
would
be
denied
a
1291
(b)
certification.
so,
we
would
be
back
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
would
be
back
here
and
we
would’ve
played
ring
around
the
rosie
with
--
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
do.
i
think
that
this
court
has
an
absolute
right
and
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
question.
i
still
think
that
if
they
decide
against
judge
kaufman
and
overrule
judge
kaufman
that
we
have
a
right
to
be
here
under
the
subsequent
activities
under
cohen.
i
don’t
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
quite
apart.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes,
i
think
in
eisen
i,
you
have
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
that
you
mentioned,
and
certainly
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
probably
a
responsibility
to
resolve
it
at
this
time.
but
we
also
feel
that
we
are
here
under
cohen,
and
under
the
things
that
were
done
to
us
under
cohen
and
that
this
court
should
take
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
in
that
connection
to
the
case
of
schlagenhauf
against
holder.
in
that
case,
this
court
decided
that
they
were
deciding
rule
35,
a
question
under
the
rule
35.
it
was
a
matter
of
first
impression
at
that
time,
but
it
was
a
rule
promulgated
by
this
court.
and
this
court
indicated
that
it
felt
a
responsibility
to
put
at
rest
all
the
controversy
under
rule
35.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
anybody
can
deny
that
the
status
of
rule
23
below
is
a
mess,
and
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
assume
the
responsibility
now
that
we’re
here
before
you
with
this
case
which
has
so
many
facets
to
it,
i
would
hope
that
you
would
have
assume
the
responsibility
of
deciding
the
case.
now,
if
i
may
proceed
to
consideration,
short
brief
consideration
of
the
facts.
we
all
know
that
this
case
is
six
million
people.
the
class
involves
six
million
people.
eisen
ii
was
decided
and
there
were
only
3.5
million,
but
has
grown
to
six
million
by
just
a
little
investigation
and
by
stipulation
of
fact.
now,
the
enormity
of
this
class,
i
know
bothered
judge
medina,
and
i
know
it
must
bother
every
judge
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
6%
of
those
people
live
abroad
and
speak
foreign
languages.
the
class
is
diverse.
i
would
refer
probably
i
think
the
best
affidavit
on
our
appendix
is
rather
of
mr.
smith
of
merrill
lynch
on
(a)
53,
in
which
he
lists
25
different
kinds
of
investors,
by
no
means
an
exhaustive
list,
15
types
of
orders
which
can
be
changed
and
interchanged
in
such
a
way
that
15
isn’t
the
figure,
but
at
many
times
13.
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
all
times,
in
this
case,
mr.
eisen
can
sue
in
his
own
behalf.
that
he
can
obtain
trebled
damages
for
whatever
damage
he
received
and
he
can
receive
attorney’s
fees.
i
submit
that
the
fact
show
that
this
class
is
unmanageable
just
by
size
alone,
but
i
will
discuss
that
more
fully
when
i
get
to
manageability
and
to
notice.
the
plaintiff
in
his
reply
brief
states
that
the
court’s
finding
regarding
the
defendant’s
antitrust
violations
and
exchange
act
6
violations
are
not
before
this
court
for
review
because
they
were
not
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
my
favorite
reading
is
judge
medina’s
opinion,
and
i
am
very
familiar
with
it,
and
i
have
found
that
in
three
different
places,
he
has
said
that
the
findings
and
the
rulings
of
judge
tyler
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
in
other
words,
our
antitrust
liability,
the
exchange
of
section
6
liability
are
vacated.
and
he
has
also
pointed
out
that
under
his
opinion,
judge
tyler
had
no
right
to
consider
the
merits,
and
i
do
think
they
are
before
this
court,
and
i
say
that
and
that
they
have
been
vacated
and
are
of
no
effect.
now,
the
only
other
thing
i
have
is
that
plaintiff
continues
to
say
in
his
brief
and
in
oral
argument
that
the
stipulations
says
that
56%
of
the
class
member’s
transactions
are
unpaid.
the
stipulation
says
that
56%
of
the
transactions
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
are
unpaid,
and
i
think
that
you
will
realize
that
those
are
two
different
things.
when
we’re
dealing
with
class
members,
we’re
not
dealing
with
transactions
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
well
that
leads
me
into
the
question
of
manageability.
we
have
a
brand
new
theory
which
has
been
put
forth
by
the
plaintiff
in
his
reply
brief.
this
has
never
been
argued
before.
it’s
never
been
briefed
before,
and
the
plaintiff
is
asking
this
court
to
ask
as
a
court
of
first
resort,
and
decide
this
incredibly
complicated
subject.
he
has
suggested
that
we
now
mail
checks
to
2,250,000
people
with
what
they
are
entitled
to,
that
sounds
very
simple,
but
i
might
point
out
that
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
as
soon
as
the
formula
is
arrived
at,
which
the
plaintiff
says
that
judge
tyler
has
arrived
at
a
formula
that
he
will
apply
that
formula,
and
then
will
be
able
to
tell
what
the
damages
are,
and
what
is
due
to
these
two
million
people
who
are
readily
identifiable.
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
as
or
when
we’ve
lost
the
case.
i’m
talking
yes,
if
as
or
when
we’ve
lost
the
case
and
i’m
talking
on
the
point
of
manageability.
now
but
this
just
doesn’t
stop
when
we
lose
it,
somebody’s
got
to
receive
this
month.
mr.
devereux
milburn
it
stops
the
distribution.
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
we
lose,
right.
now,
even
judge
tyler
in
his
second
and
third
opinions
envisages
the
filing
of
claims
by
members
of
the
class
who
have
been
injured.
he
never
applied
a
formula.
he
didn’t
ever
invented
the
formula
to
apply
to
the
individuals
who
might
present
claims.
now,
it’s
very
even,
i
might
just
even
on
the
notice
which
he
suggests
might
be
adequate
on
(a)
224,
to
225,
he
suggests
that
the
claimants
will
have
to
describe
the
type
of
transaction
they
have
entered
into.
now,
it’s
very
easy
to
say
that
this
can
be
obtained
from
the
tapes.
well,
it’s
easy
to
say,
but
it
probably
can’t
be
done,
and
if
it
can
be
done,
it
can
be
done
only
at
immense
expense.
the
odd-lot
houses
do
not
deal
with
customers.
we
deal
with
the
commission
houses
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
customers.
a
great
many
of
customers
don’t
even
know
we
exist.
they
order
their
stock
from
their
broker,
and
their
broker
deals
with
us
if
it’s
an
odd-lot.
now,
we
have
a
tape,
and
that
tape
has
on
it
all
the
transactions
of
the
day,
and
all
the
transactions
for
the
commission
houses.
now,
that
tape
does
not
have
any
names
or
addresses.
it
does
have
an
account
number.
the
14
warehouses,
and
now
i
might
point
out
where
there
are
now
nine
warehouses,
five
have
disappeared
or
ceasing
to
do
business,
but
they
have
tapes
and
we
can
match
our
tapes
with
them
and
our
account
numbers
with
their
tapes,
and
we
can
get
the
names
and
addresses,
and
it
is
a
very
simple
proposition.
it
is
not
what
the
plaintiff’s
attorney
had
described,
it
is
simple.
and
we
can
do
it,
and
we
have
offered
to
do
it,
and
i
think
that
because
we
offered
to
do
it
in
that
way,
that
the
obtainable
of
reasonable
effort,
it
might
be
even
be
said
that
anything
you
get
for
nothing
is
you
obtain
with
reasonable
effort,
but
this
requires
no
effort.
we
will
pay
for
it,
and
we
will
hand
it
to
him.
but
now,
we
still
have
these
two
million
people.
we
have
maintained
all
along
that
if
you
put
in
a
market
order,
it
costs
us
a
certain
amount
of
money
to
handle
it.
if
you
put
in
one
of
these
incredibly
intricate
orders
which
you
referred
to
in
the
affidavits
of
the
brokerage
houses,
it
costs
a
lot
of
money
to
handle,
a
lot
of
money
i
am
using
figuratively.
but,
in
some
cases,
we
may
lose,
on
handling
one
of
those,
but
in
others
we
may
not.
and
in
that
way,
each
transaction
we
maintain
before
we
pay
anybody,
we
should
have
a
right
to
defend
ourselves
to
say
not
only
was
it
not
excessive,
but
it
wasn’t
enough.
and
that
we
should
do
that
in
each
individual
case.
who
are
we
as
defendants
that
we
should
be
denied
the
right
to
come
face
to
face
with
people
who
say
we
owe
them
money,
and
say
no
you
don’t.
are
we
required
to
pay
money
to
people
that
we
don’t
owe
money
to?
i
maintain
your
honors
that
we
are
not.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
don’t
think
there
was
a
formula.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i’m
objecting
to
a
formula,
and
i’m
objecting,
if
there
is
one
to
the
application
willy-nilly
to
two
million
people,
a
great
many
of
whom
we
don’t
owe.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
i
don’t
know
what
the
formula
was.
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
they
did
know,
if
we’re
talking
5%
they
talked
about,
the
$3.18
and
the
$20.00
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
say
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
think
judge
tyler
reached
a
formula
to
deal
with
these
two
million
people,
or
with
individual
claims.
i
think
judge
tyler
said
“if
you
have
an
individual
claim,
you’ve
got
to
come
in
and
file
it.”
now,
i
think
i
might
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
think
the
plaintiff’s
attorney,
i
think
i’d
mentioned
this
briefly,
has
misinterpreted
the
testimony
of
mr.
martin
who
worked
for
walston,
and
who
which
is
now
not
doing
this
kind
of
business.
we
never
said
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
thank
you.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
devereux
milburn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
left
dwelling
on
mr.
martin’s
testimony.
i’d
like
to
finish
that
in
about
one
sentence.
the
laborious
process
which
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
referred
to
is
the
laborious
process
of
matching
transactions
to
odd-lot
customers.
it
is
not
the
process
of
identifying
names
and
addresses
of
the
odd-lot
customers.
now,
if
i
could
turn
briefly
to
the
subject
of
notice.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court’s
error
in
this
respect
was
his
feeling
that
rule
23
and
due
process,
the
notice
required
under
those
sections
is
the
question
is
whether
a
stringent
and
harsh
notice
will
vitiate
the
class
action
device
if
the
plaintiff
is
unable
to
pay
the
notice.
now,
i
would
like
to
divide
the
discussion
of
notice
into
two
questions.
first,
we
have
the
rule
itself,
and
secondly
we
have
due
process.
every
court
that
has
dealt
with
the
subject
of
notice,
and
that
is
every
court,
have
said
that
notice
must
conform
with
the
rule
and
with
due
process.
now,
i
would
like
to
submit
to
this
court
that
we
have
here
a
rule.
we
have
in
(c)
3
--
(c)
2
excuse
me,
we
have
the
requirement
which
i’m
sure
you’re
familiar
with,
but
it’s
one
sentence.
“in
any
class
action,
maintained
under
subdivision
(b)
(3),
the
court
shall
direct
to
the
members
of
the
class,
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances
including
the
individual
notice
to
all
members
who
can
be
identified
through
reasonable
effort.”
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
we
have
a
question
here
of
the
english
language.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
that
sentence
means.
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
it
means
insofar
as
individual
notice
to
those
who
can
be
identified
with
reasonable
effort
means.
there
is
no
way
that
i
can
see
and
the
attorneys
for
the
plaintiffs
have
tried
in
their
briefs
and
in
oral
arguments
to
twist
one
clause
to
modify
another
clause.
but
i
submit
that
if
it
is
read
as
we
all
understand
our
language,
that
it
does
require
individual
notice
to
all
members
who
can
be
identified
through
a
reasonable
effort.
that
is
what
the
rule
says,
and
i
submit
that
that
rule
must
be
complied
with.
the
second
string
to
my
bow
is
this
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
it
would
not
be
adequate
under
this
section
of
the
rule,
your
honor.
i
also
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
because
of
the
use
of
the
clause
following
including,
beginning
with
the
word
“including.”
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes.
now
the
second
string
to
my
bow,
as
i
was
saying
is
that
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
requires
individual
notices?
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
i
further
submit
that
due
process
requires
this
type
of
individual
notice.
and
further,
that
the
notice
provided
by
judge
tyler
is
hopelessly
inadequate.
if
i
might
quote
judge
medina,
“it’s
a
fuss.”
out
of
these
six
million
people,
we
are
giving
notice
to
2000
people
who
have
10
or
more
odd-lot
transactions.
we
are
giving
notice
to
5000
odd-lot
out
of
six
million
selected
at
random.
we
are
publishing
in
new
york,
in
los
angeles,
and
in
california,
and
in
the
wall
street
journal,
nothing.
nobody
is
taking
care
of
in
middle
america.
two-thirds
of
the
six
million
people,
is
stipulated,
are
not
in
new
york,
california,
or
will
probably
not
be
reached
by
the
newspapers
in
those
localities.
now,
if
we
have
that,
i
would
cite
to
this
court
i’m
sure
necessarily
mullane,
which
sets
forth
your
rules
as
to
due
process.
mullane
had
some
what
might
be
called
language
with
loose
language
and
it
was
tightened
by
schroeder
almost
immediately
thereafter.
and
schroeder
said
“if
anyone
can
be
very
easily
identified,
he
is
entitled
to
individual
notice.”
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
would
say
that
we
couldn’t
give
him
individual
notice.
we
couldn’t
mail
a
letter.
i
would
put
him
with
the
other
four
million
that
can’t
be
identified
and
hope
that
he
will
be
served
by
publication,
but
not
the
type
of
publication
suggested
by
judge
tyler
in
his
opinion.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
devereux
milburn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jackson
and
i,
mr.
jackson
represents
the
stock
exchange,
and
i
represent
the
odd-lot
houses,
are
dividing
our
time.
basically
equally
and
just
to
give
you
a
plan
on
what
we
intend
to
do,
i
will
deal
with
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
i
will
deal
with
the
question
of
expanding
and
correcting
some
of
the
facts.
i
will
deal
with
manageability
and
with
notice.
mr.
jackson
will
deal
with
the
substantive
aspects
of
rule
23.
he
will
deal
with
fluid
recovery,
mini-hearing,
and
the
costs
of
notice,
and
policy
considerations.
i
would
like
to
commence
with
arguing
briefly
as
to
jurisdiction,
which
was
requested
in
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
we
at
the
court
of
appeals,
had
jurisdiction.
mainly
because
we
have
had
from
us
extracted
a
sum
of
$19,000.00
or
it
is
intended
to
be
extracted
from
us
to
finance
a
case
against
ourselves,
and
if
we
are
successful
by
the
plaintiff’s
own
admission,
no
chance
of
recovering
it.
we
have
had
inflicted
upon
us
what
we
consider
an
illegal
and
unlawful
mini-hearing,
a
truncated
hearing
on
the
merits
prior
to
trial,
and
prior
to
jury
trial
which
we
have
requested.
we
have
been
subjected
to,
or
we
are
told
that
we
will
be
subjected
to
such
inadequate
notice
that
the
rights
of
the
class
will
be
denied,
that
res
judicata
will
be
denied
to
us,
that
the
chance
of
plaintiffs
is
opting
out,
plaintiff
members
or
the
plaintiff
class
opting
out
will
be
denied
to
us
because
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
notice.
we
have
also
seen
a
misconstruction
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
as
it
applies
to
the
odd-lot
houses
and
a
misconstruction
of
section
6
of
the
exchange
act
as
it
applies
to
the
stock
exchange.
we
submit
that
because
of
all
these
violent
actions
taken
by
judge
tyler
against
us
that
this
case
comes
clearly
under
the
doctrine
of
cohen
against
beneficial
loan.
cohen
said
that
when
matters
were
too
important
to
be
denied
review,
too
independent
to
require
postponement
until
the
whole
case
is
decided
that
they
should
be
adjudicated
at
the
time.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
i
think
that
that
is
a
possibility,
but
we
feel
that
we
have
a
right
under
the
cohen
doctrine
to
appeal
at
this
time,
and
i
would
find,
i
am
just
guessing,
that
my
clients
might
have
some
objection
to
following
the
course
you
suggest
and
maybe
going
to
jail
pending
on
appeal.
i
haven’t
discussed
it
with
him,
but
i’m
guessing.[laughter]
now,
i
would
like
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes,
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that
is
correct.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
devereux
milburn
your
honor,
we
stand
by
our
brief
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
case.
however,
in
this
case
if
judge
kaufman
is
reversed,
then
as
i
think
some
instead,
we
will
be
back
with
judge
tyler,
the
1966
judge
tyler
and
we
prefer
and
i
think
one
could
assume
from
what’s
happened
since
that
judge
tyler
might,
as
he
is
permitted
to
by
the
rule,
he
might
change
his
opinion.
and
he
might
reinstate
tyler
ii,
as
i
call
it,
and
tyler
ii
(a).
now,
looking
at
the
opinions
in
the
en
banc
decision
and
what
is
gone,
the
water
that
has
gone
under
the
bridge,
i
cannot
see
how
we
would
be
denied
a
1291
(b)
certification.
so,
we
would
be
back
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
would
be
back
here
and
we
would’ve
played
ring
around
the
rosie
with
--
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
do.
i
think
that
this
court
has
an
absolute
right
and
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
question.
i
still
think
that
if
they
decide
against
judge
kaufman
and
overrule
judge
kaufman
that
we
have
a
right
to
be
here
under
the
subsequent
activities
under
cohen.
i
don’t
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
quite
apart.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes,
i
think
in
eisen
i,
you
have
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
that
you
mentioned,
and
certainly
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
and
probably
a
responsibility
to
resolve
it
at
this
time.
but
we
also
feel
that
we
are
here
under
cohen,
and
under
the
things
that
were
done
to
us
under
cohen
and
that
this
court
should
take
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
in
that
connection
to
the
case
of
schlagenhauf
against
holder.
in
that
case,
this
court
decided
that
they
were
deciding
rule
35,
a
question
under
the
rule
35.
it
was
a
matter
of
first
impression
at
that
time,
but
it
was
a
rule
promulgated
by
this
court.
and
this
court
indicated
that
it
felt
a
responsibility
to
put
at
rest
all
the
controversy
under
rule
35.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
anybody
can
deny
that
the
status
of
rule
23
below
is
a
mess,
and
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
assume
the
responsibility
now
that
we’re
here
before
you
with
this
case
which
has
so
many
facets
to
it,
i
would
hope
that
you
would
have
assume
the
responsibility
of
deciding
the
case.
now,
if
i
may
proceed
to
consideration,
short
brief
consideration
of
the
facts.
we
all
know
that
this
case
is
six
million
people.
the
class
involves
six
million
people.
eisen
ii
was
decided
and
there
were
only
3.5
million,
but
has
grown
to
six
million
by
just
a
little
investigation
and
by
stipulation
of
fact.
now,
the
enormity
of
this
class,
i
know
bothered
judge
medina,
and
i
know
it
must
bother
every
judge
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
6%
of
those
people
live
abroad
and
speak
foreign
languages.
the
class
is
diverse.
i
would
refer
probably
i
think
the
best
affidavit
on
our
appendix
is
rather
of
mr.
smith
of
merrill
lynch
on
(a)
53,
in
which
he
lists
25
different
kinds
of
investors,
by
no
means
an
exhaustive
list,
15
types
of
orders
which
can
be
changed
and
interchanged
in
such
a
way
that
15
isn’t
the
figure,
but
at
many
times
13.
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
all
times,
in
this
case,
mr.
eisen
can
sue
in
his
own
behalf.
that
he
can
obtain
trebled
damages
for
whatever
damage
he
received
and
he
can
receive
attorney’s
fees.
i
submit
that
the
fact
show
that
this
class
is
unmanageable
just
by
size
alone,
but
i
will
discuss
that
more
fully
when
i
get
to
manageability
and
to
notice.
the
plaintiff
in
his
reply
brief
states
that
the
court’s
finding
regarding
the
defendant’s
antitrust
violations
and
exchange
act
6
violations
are
not
before
this
court
for
review
because
they
were
not
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
my
favorite
reading
is
judge
medina’s
opinion,
and
i
am
very
familiar
with
it,
and
i
have
found
that
in
three
different
places,
he
has
said
that
the
findings
and
the
rulings
of
judge
tyler
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
in
other
words,
our
antitrust
liability,
the
exchange
of
section
6
liability
are
vacated.
and
he
has
also
pointed
out
that
under
his
opinion,
judge
tyler
had
no
right
to
consider
the
merits,
and
i
do
think
they
are
before
this
court,
and
i
say
that
and
that
they
have
been
vacated
and
are
of
no
effect.
now,
the
only
other
thing
i
have
is
that
plaintiff
continues
to
say
in
his
brief
and
in
oral
argument
that
the
stipulations
says
that
56%
of
the
class
member’s
transactions
are
unpaid.
the
stipulation
says
that
56%
of
the
transactions
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
are
unpaid,
and
i
think
that
you
will
realize
that
those
are
two
different
things.
when
we’re
dealing
with
class
members,
we’re
not
dealing
with
transactions
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
well
that
leads
me
into
the
question
of
manageability.
we
have
a
brand
new
theory
which
has
been
put
forth
by
the
plaintiff
in
his
reply
brief.
this
has
never
been
argued
before.
it’s
never
been
briefed
before,
and
the
plaintiff
is
asking
this
court
to
ask
as
a
court
of
first
resort,
and
decide
this
incredibly
complicated
subject.
he
has
suggested
that
we
now
mail
checks
to
2,250,000
people
with
what
they
are
entitled
to,
that
sounds
very
simple,
but
i
might
point
out
that
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
as
soon
as
the
formula
is
arrived
at,
which
the
plaintiff
says
that
judge
tyler
has
arrived
at
a
formula
that
he
will
apply
that
formula,
and
then
will
be
able
to
tell
what
the
damages
are,
and
what
is
due
to
these
two
million
people
who
are
readily
identifiable.
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
as
or
when
we’ve
lost
the
case.
i’m
talking
yes,
if
as
or
when
we’ve
lost
the
case
and
i’m
talking
on
the
point
of
manageability.
now
but
this
just
doesn’t
stop
when
we
lose
it,
somebody’s
got
to
receive
this
month.
mr.
devereux
milburn
it
stops
the
distribution.
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
we
lose,
right.
now,
even
judge
tyler
in
his
second
and
third
opinions
envisages
the
filing
of
claims
by
members
of
the
class
who
have
been
injured.
he
never
applied
a
formula.
he
didn’t
ever
invented
the
formula
to
apply
to
the
individuals
who
might
present
claims.
now,
it’s
very
even,
i
might
just
even
on
the
notice
which
he
suggests
might
be
adequate
on
(a)
224,
to
225,
he
suggests
that
the
claimants
will
have
to
describe
the
type
of
transaction
they
have
entered
into.
now,
it’s
very
easy
to
say
that
this
can
be
obtained
from
the
tapes.
well,
it’s
easy
to
say,
but
it
probably
can’t
be
done,
and
if
it
can
be
done,
it
can
be
done
only
at
immense
expense.
the
odd-lot
houses
do
not
deal
with
customers.
we
deal
with
the
commission
houses
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
customers.
a
great
many
of
customers
don’t
even
know
we
exist.
they
order
their
stock
from
their
broker,
and
their
broker
deals
with
us
if
it’s
an
odd-lot.
now,
we
have
a
tape,
and
that
tape
has
on
it
all
the
transactions
of
the
day,
and
all
the
transactions
for
the
commission
houses.
now,
that
tape
does
not
have
any
names
or
addresses.
it
does
have
an
account
number.
the
14
warehouses,
and
now
i
might
point
out
where
there
are
now
nine
warehouses,
five
have
disappeared
or
ceasing
to
do
business,
but
they
have
tapes
and
we
can
match
our
tapes
with
them
and
our
account
numbers
with
their
tapes,
and
we
can
get
the
names
and
addresses,
and
it
is
a
very
simple
proposition.
it
is
not
what
the
plaintiff’s
attorney
had
described,
it
is
simple.
and
we
can
do
it,
and
we
have
offered
to
do
it,
and
i
think
that
because
we
offered
to
do
it
in
that
way,
that
the
obtainable
of
reasonable
effort,
it
might
be
even
be
said
that
anything
you
get
for
nothing
is
you
obtain
with
reasonable
effort,
but
this
requires
no
effort.
we
will
pay
for
it,
and
we
will
hand
it
to
him.
but
now,
we
still
have
these
two
million
people.
we
have
maintained
all
along
that
if
you
put
in
a
market
order,
it
costs
us
a
certain
amount
of
money
to
handle
it.
if
you
put
in
one
of
these
incredibly
intricate
orders
which
you
referred
to
in
the
affidavits
of
the
brokerage
houses,
it
costs
a
lot
of
money
to
handle,
a
lot
of
money
i
am
using
figuratively.
but,
in
some
cases,
we
may
lose,
on
handling
one
of
those,
but
in
others
we
may
not.
and
in
that
way,
each
transaction
we
maintain
before
we
pay
anybody,
we
should
have
a
right
to
defend
ourselves
to
say
not
only
was
it
not
excessive,
but
it
wasn’t
enough.
and
that
we
should
do
that
in
each
individual
case.
who
are
we
as
defendants
that
we
should
be
denied
the
right
to
come
face
to
face
with
people
who
say
we
owe
them
money,
and
say
no
you
don’t.
are
we
required
to
pay
money
to
people
that
we
don’t
owe
money
to?
i
maintain
your
honors
that
we
are
not.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
don’t
think
there
was
a
formula.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i’m
objecting
to
a
formula,
and
i’m
objecting,
if
there
is
one
to
the
application
willy-nilly
to
two
million
people,
a
great
many
of
whom
we
don’t
owe.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
i
don’t
know
what
the
formula
was.
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
they
did
know,
if
we’re
talking
5%
they
talked
about,
the
$3.18
and
the
$20.00
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
say
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
think
judge
tyler
reached
a
formula
to
deal
with
these
two
million
people,
or
with
individual
claims.
i
think
judge
tyler
said
“if
you
have
an
individual
claim,
you’ve
got
to
come
in
and
file
it.”
now,
i
think
i
might
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
think
the
plaintiff’s
attorney,
i
think
i’d
mentioned
this
briefly,
has
misinterpreted
the
testimony
of
mr.
martin
who
worked
for
walston,
and
who
which
is
now
not
doing
this
kind
of
business.
we
never
said
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
thank
you.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
devereux
milburn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
left
dwelling
on
mr.
martin’s
testimony.
i’d
like
to
finish
that
in
about
one
sentence.
the
laborious
process
which
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
referred
to
is
the
laborious
process
of
matching
transactions
to
odd-lot
customers.
it
is
not
the
process
of
identifying
names
and
addresses
of
the
odd-lot
customers.
now,
if
i
could
turn
briefly
to
the
subject
of
notice.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court’s
error
in
this
respect
was
his
feeling
that
rule
23
and
due
process,
the
notice
required
under
those
sections
is
the
question
is
whether
a
stringent
and
harsh
notice
will
vitiate
the
class
action
device
if
the
plaintiff
is
unable
to
pay
the
notice.
now,
i
would
like
to
divide
the
discussion
of
notice
into
two
questions.
first,
we
have
the
rule
itself,
and
secondly
we
have
due
process.
every
court
that
has
dealt
with
the
subject
of
notice,
and
that
is
every
court,
have
said
that
notice
must
conform
with
the
rule
and
with
due
process.
now,
i
would
like
to
submit
to
this
court
that
we
have
here
a
rule.
we
have
in
(c)
3
--
(c)
2
excuse
me,
we
have
the
requirement
which
i’m
sure
you’re
familiar
with,
but
it’s
one
sentence.
“in
any
class
action,
maintained
under
subdivision
(b)
(3),
the
court
shall
direct
to
the
members
of
the
class,
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances
including
the
individual
notice
to
all
members
who
can
be
identified
through
reasonable
effort.”
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
we
have
a
question
here
of
the
english
language.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
that
sentence
means.
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
it
means
insofar
as
individual
notice
to
those
who
can
be
identified
with
reasonable
effort
means.
there
is
no
way
that
i
can
see
and
the
attorneys
for
the
plaintiffs
have
tried
in
their
briefs
and
in
oral
arguments
to
twist
one
clause
to
modify
another
clause.
but
i
submit
that
if
it
is
read
as
we
all
understand
our
language,
that
it
does
require
individual
notice
to
all
members
who
can
be
identified
through
a
reasonable
effort.
that
is
what
the
rule
says,
and
i
submit
that
that
rule
must
be
complied
with.
the
second
string
to
my
bow
is
this
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
it
would
not
be
adequate
under
this
section
of
the
rule,
your
honor.
i
also
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
because
of
the
use
of
the
clause
following
including,
beginning
with
the
word
“including.”
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes.
now
the
second
string
to
my
bow,
as
i
was
saying
is
that
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
requires
individual
notices?
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes
sir.
i
further
submit
that
due
process
requires
this
type
of
individual
notice.
and
further,
that
the
notice
provided
by
judge
tyler
is
hopelessly
inadequate.
if
i
might
quote
judge
medina,
“it’s
a
fuss.”
out
of
these
six
million
people,
we
are
giving
notice
to
2000
people
who
have
10
or
more
odd-lot
transactions.
we
are
giving
notice
to
5000
odd-lot
out
of
six
million
selected
at
random.
we
are
publishing
in
new
york,
in
los
angeles,
and
in
california,
and
in
the
wall
street
journal,
nothing.
nobody
is
taking
care
of
in
middle
america.
two-thirds
of
the
six
million
people,
is
stipulated,
are
not
in
new
york,
california,
or
will
probably
not
be
reached
by
the
newspapers
in
those
localities.
now,
if
we
have
that,
i
would
cite
to
this
court
i’m
sure
necessarily
mullane,
which
sets
forth
your
rules
as
to
due
process.
mullane
had
some
what
might
be
called
language
with
loose
language
and
it
was
tightened
by
schroeder
almost
immediately
thereafter.
and
schroeder
said
“if
anyone
can
be
very
easily
identified,
he
is
entitled
to
individual
notice.”
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
would
say
that
we
couldn’t
give
him
individual
notice.
we
couldn’t
mail
a
letter.
i
would
put
him
with
the
other
four
million
that
can’t
be
identified
and
hope
that
he
will
be
served
by
publication,
but
not
the
type
of
publication
suggested
by
judge
tyler
in
his
opinion.
thank
you
very
much.
