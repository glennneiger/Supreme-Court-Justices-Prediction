mr.
william
eldred
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
and
this
was
the
basic
difference
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
is
the
question
whether
a
rule
of
procedure
may
be
used
to
effect
changes
in
substantive
law.
the
court
of
appeals,
we
submit,
correctly
held
no,
and
in
doing
so
it
reversed
district
court
determinations,
which
were
based
on
the
premise
that
in
the
interest
of
liberal
interpretation
of
rule
23
and
in
the
interest
of
punishing
alleged
wrongdoers,
this
case
must
proceed
as
a
class
action
at
any
price.
and
the
price,
which
the
district
court
exacted,
was
the
bending
and
indeed
the
breaking
of
established
constitutional
and
legal
principles
of
substantive
law,
all
in
order
to
let
mr.
eisen
act
as
the
self-appointed
champion
of
the
rights
of
six
million
class
members
scattered
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
free
world.
now,
rule
23
was
utilized
to
order
substantive
law
in
this
case
by
the
district
court,
we
submit,
on
the
three
points
of
notice
which
was
woefully
inadequate
under
the
rule
and
under
the
constitution
as
mr.
milburn
has
said.
secondly,
by
the
creation
of
the
fluid
recovery
device
for
the
class
as
a
whole;
thirdly,
by
the
preliminary
hearing
on
the
merits
followed
by
an
order
that
the
defendants
pay
forthwith
without
recovery,
90%
of
the
cost
of
communicating
with
the
class.
and
these
radical
departures
from
substantive
law
were
decreed
by
the
district
court,
because
otherwise,
the
action
was
plainly
unmanageable
as
a
class
action,
as
plaintiff’s
counsel
conceded
at
196
of
the
appendix,
when
he
urged
a
fluid
recovery,
because
he
said
that
if
each
of
the
six
million
class
members
had
to
present
his
own
personal
claim
for
damages,
the
class
indeed
would
not
be
manageable.
now,
we
submit,
your
honors
that
it’s
really
not
at
all
significant
that
class
actions
had
their
origins
in
equity.
they’re
still
procedural
devices
and
that
is
the
whole
thrust
of
rule
23.
its
purpose
as
can
be
divined
from
its
face,
and
as
appears
from
the
notes
of
the
revisers,
which
are
printed
at
pages
18
in
following
of
the
supplementary
appendix,
was
that
rule
23
was
designed
to
provide
a
means
of
bringing
together
in
a
single
forum,
existing
claims,
large
or
small,
of
actual
individual
plaintiffs
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
judicial
economy
and
efficiency,
and
uniformity
of
decision,
where
it
is
possible
to
do
so
without
sacrificing
procedural
fairness.
this
rule,
i
submit
your
honors,
confers
no
substantive
rights
on
any
litigant.
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
this
rule
are
the
courts.
the
purpose
is
to
avoid
the
multiple
litigation
of
claims
which
otherwise
would
be
litigated
in
different
forums.
the
purpose
is
to
assist
the
judiciary
and
incidentally
to
reduce
its
case
load.
there
is
nothing
in
rule
23
or
in
its
history
about
facilitating
retribution
for
wrongdoers,
alleged
wrongdoers.
there
is
nothing
in
the
rule
that
tilts
the
scales
for
or
against
plaintiffs
or
defendants,
as
is
assumed
by
some
commentators
and
was
assumed
by
the
district
court.
mr.
fine’s
discourse
on
flexible
remedies
and
his
citation
this
morning
of
the
borak
case
as
an
example
of
the
creativeness
of
the
federal
judiciary
in
not
letting
wrongs
go
unpunished,
rather
misses
the
point,
because
all
of
his
cases,
including
the
borak
case
didn’t
each
--
reach
the
question
of
creating
a
flexible
or
inventive
remedy
for
ill-gotten
gains,
until
after
liability
had
been
determined
on
the
merits.
and
those
cases
are
not
properly
considerable
in
determining
at
the
outset
of
a
litigation
whether
the
suit
should
be
permitted
to
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
or
not.
the
rule
of
course,
as
this
court
well
knows,
was
promulgated
under
the
rules
enabling
act,
which
provides
in
very
specific
terms
that
such
rules
may
not,
shall
not
abridge
in
large
or
modify
any
substantive
right
and
shall
preserve
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
now,
in
the
pending
of
substantive
law
as
to
notice
requirements,
in
that
area
i’d
like
to
add
a
few
words
to
what
mr.
milburn
has
already
said.
mr.
fine
has
attempted
to
avoid
the
notice
problems,
indeed
the
manageability
problems
by
suggesting
that
this
case
could
well
be
a
(b)
(1)
or
a
(b)
(2)
case,
rather
than
a
(b)
(3)
case.
well,
i
think
it’s
significant
that
all
judges
who
have
considered
this
case,
including
judge
tyler
have
agreed
that
this
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
(b)
(3)
case.
judge
tyler
certainly
found
to
this
effect
in
his
first
opinion
in
1966
at
95
of
the
appendix,
in
which
he
said
that
notice
was
required
by
the
rule,
and
the
rule
of
course
requires
notice
in
(b)
(3)
actions.
beyond
that,
mr.
fine
seeks
to
put
this
case
into
the
(b)
(1)
or
(b)
(2)
category
by
arguing
that
it’s
really
an
injunctive
case.
well
let’s
look
at
that.
the
injunction,
the
injunctive
claims,
claim
for
injunctive
relief
is
appended
to
a
claim
for
money
damages,
and
what
is
sought
to
be
enjoined
by
this
complaint
is
the
odd-lot
differential
which
was
established
in
1951
and
permitted
by
the
sec.
now,
since
that
time
that
differential
has
been
twice
changed,
first,
in
1966
at
the
express
direction
of
the
sec
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
and
then
later
in
1972
by
a
rule
of
the
exchange
itself.
so
it
is
evident
i
think,
that
the
claim
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
complaint
is
now
moot.
in
any
event,
judge
tyler
in
basing
his
estimate
of
damage
claims
in
this
case,
for
the
period
1962
to
1966,
did
so
by
comparison
with
the
1966
rate
as
the
proper
rate.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
suggestion
of
this
late
date,
that
this
is
an
injunctive
case,
flies
in
the
face
of
the
facts
and
in
view
of
the
obvious
problems
which
this
case
creates
for
itself,
because
it’s
essentially
a
money
damage
case.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
believe
he
intimated
that
that
was
the
case.
i
don’t
know
of
any
such
case.
i
don’t
think
that
that
result
could
be
constitutionally
defended
if
there
were
truly
adversarial
situations,
such
as
there
is
here,
in
which
a
large
class
of
consumers
seeks
to
in
effect
to
recover
against
the
supplier.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
or
give
the
notice.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
turning
to
the
next
invention
of
substantive
law
which
we
believe
to
be
completely
unjustified
by
rule
23
and
its
true
purposes,
i
come
to
the
question
of
the
so-called
fluid
recovery
for
the
class
as
a
whole.
now
of
course
it’s
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
law
that
money
damages
are
recoverable
only
by
persons
who
are
injured
by
illegal
conduct
who
can
prove
damages
flowing
from
such
conduct.
and
this
principle
is
of
course
enacted
in
the
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
which
is
here
involved,
any
person
injured
in
his
business
and
property,
and
so
on.
and
the
same
principle
of
compensatory
recovery
is
recognized
in
the
line
of
cases
which
have
construed
section
6
of
the
exchange
act
which
is
here
alleged
to
be
the
basis
for
the
exchanges'
liability.
but,
the
plaintiff
has
conceded
that
this
case
could
not
proceed
as
a
class
action
if
this
fundamental
principle
of
substantive
law
were
to
be
observed,
if
all
class
members
were
required
to
prove
their
damages,
and
it
was
on
this
basis
in
order
to
save
the
class
action
at
all
costs
that
the
district
court
ruled
that
it
would
make
an
award
of
damages
to
the
class
as
a
whole,
that
class
members
could
file
claims
and
prove
their
damages
and
if
they
did
so,
they
could
recover
damages,
but
for
the
great
bulk
of
the
class
as
a
whole,
the
differential
would
be
reduced
in
the
future
until
the
total
award
was
exhausted.
well
now,
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
class
as
a
whole.
a
class
is
not
an
entity
which
is
entitled
to
collect
damages
in
its
own
right.
a
class
is
a
collection
of
claimants,
and
that
we
think
is
the
teaching
of
this
court’s
decision
in
snyder
versus
harris
at
394
u.s.
an
award
of
damages
to
the
class
as
whole
by
reduction
of
the
differential
in
the
future
would
do
two
things.
first,
it
would
benefit
future
purchasers
and
sellers
of
odd-lots
who
are
not
purchasers
and
sellers
in
1962
to
1966,
and
thus
not
members
of
the
class
and
thus
not
persons
who
are
injured
by
any
of
the
defendant’s
allegedly
illegal
conduct.
and
secondly,
such
a
device
would
not
compensate
past
traders
who
may
not
trade
in
the
future.
and
furthermore,
this
device
except
as
to
those
few
class
members
who
might
file
claims
were
denied
to
the
defendants
of
their
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
damaged
issues
and
i
refer
to
this
court’s
case
decision
in
curtis
against
loether
of
last
week.
in
addition,
what
the
district
court
proposed
here
by
way
of
a
rate
reduction
in
the
future
would
plainly
usurp
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
sec
under
the
exchange
act.
courts
have
no
power
to
fix
odd-lot
rates
in
the
first
instance
under
the
congressional
scheme
of
regulation
of
exchanges
expressed
in
the
exchange
act.
that
function
is
confided
to
the
sec
and
the
statute
enacts
standards
which
must
be
applied
for
rate
making
under
its
mandate.
and
the
court’s
injection
of
itself
into
this
area
of
rate
making
is
contrary
to
the
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
forbid
judicial
intrusion
into
areas
reserved
by
statute
for
agency
expertise.
finally,
in
the
catalog
of
substantive
law
changes
effected
in
the
name
of
rule
23,
we
come
to
the
preliminary
hearing
on
the
merits,
and
the
resulting
order
that
the
defendants
should
pay
90%
of
the
cost
of
giving
notice.
this
of
course,
we
believe
to
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
defendants
fifth
amendment
rights
to
due
process
and
their
seventh
amendment
rights
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes.
any
order
to
pay
any
part
of
the
cost,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
a
poor
man’s
case,
even
though
mr.
eisen
is
not
willing
to
pay
the
cost
of
notice.
after
all,
he
is
an
investor
in
odd-lots
of
stock
on
the
exchange.
but
certainly,
the
analogy
to
the
in
forma
pauperis
case
is
not
implied.
i’m
quite
aware
that
on
occasion,
courts
do
order
the
opposite
party
to
advance
certain
costs,
but
those
i
don’t
believe
that
this
practice
is
generally
resorted
to
where
it’s
apparent
that
the
costs
can
never
be
recovered,
as
is
the
case
here.
we
have
a
bill
of
cost
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
some
$11,000.00
which
will
never
be
recovered.
and
i
don’t
think
that
it’s
possible
to
say
as
mr.
fine
does,
well
this
is
no
worse
than
discovery
costs.
everybody
realizes
that
this
is
an
incident
of
litigation.
i
agree
that
in
a
litigation,
every
party
has
to
pay
his
own
cost
of
discovery,
whether
it’s
five
million
for
twa,
or
what,
but
that’s
quite
different
from
compelling
a
party
to
pay
his
adversary’s
cost,
the
cost
of
financing
the
litigation
against
him,
and
these
costs
of
giving
notice
are
those
which
should
be
borne
by
the
plaintiff,
because
he
has
elected
to
represent
this
class.
in
order
to
be
an
adequate
representative,
he
surely
has
to
communicate
with
them.
that
is
his
expense,
and
there
certainly
is
no
warrant
for
putting
all
that
expense
on
the
defendants.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
there’s
nothing
to
prevent
that.
he
can
proceed
individually.
in
times
gone
by
when
there
was
not
such
an
allure
for
class
actions,
people
did
proceed
individually
as
test
cases,
where
there
was
some
substantial
principle
to
be
vindicated,
there’s
nothing
to
prevent
that
here.
furthermore,
he
has
the
prospect
of
treble
damages,
and
more
than
that
his
legal
fees
will
be
paid
for,
because
they’re
not
limited
under
the
case
law
by
the
amount
of
his
recovery.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
if
he
wins,
yes
your
honor,
only
if
he
wins.
if
he
loses,
he
takes
the
chance
of
every
litigant.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
that’s
right
mr.
chief
justice.
they
are
not.
they
are
asking
to
be
let
alone.
mr.
fine
argued,
rather
eloquently
i
thought,
that
the
exchange
should
be
made
to
pay
all
of
the
costs,
because
it
failed
to
protect
investors.
well
now,
he’s
trying
to
uphold
the
decision
of
judge
tyler,
but
judge
tyler
didn’t
find
any
such
thing
as
that,
nor
is
there
any
sec
determination
that
the
exchange
failed
to
protect
the
investors.
indeed,
the
very
differential
complaint
of
here
was
permitted
to
go
into
effect
by
the
sec
in
1951,
and
in
1966,
it
was
changed
at
the
direction
of
the
sec.
mr.
fine
has
also
attempted
to
justify
settling
the
cost
of
notice
on
the
exchange
alone,
by
analogizing
the
case
to
those
involving
corporations
where
judge
medina
rightly
said
“this
may
be
a
situation
where
the
plaintiffs
don’t
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
notice,
where
they’re
shareholders
in
the
corporation.”
well
it’s
perfectly
obvious
i
think
that
there
is
no
proper
analogy
between
shareholders
of
a
corporation
who
own
the
corporation,
and
customers
of
member
firms
of
the
exchange.
now,
the
final
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
the
cost
of
individual
notice
to
the
readily
identifiable
members
of
the
class?
i
should
say
your
honor,
if
that
were
the
case,
that
notice
would
not
be
an
obstacle
to
the
class
as
continuing.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
i
think
the
question
of
manageability,
your
honor.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
oh!
yes.
consider
the
problem
is
posed
by
very
large
class
actions
where
the
alleged
class
is
enormous,
as
is
true
here,
and
where
each
individual
member
of
that
class
possesses
a
very
small
claim.
that
is
this
case
and
that
is
the
case
which
is
very
difficult
to
manage.
why
is
that,
because
the
claims
are
so
small.
in
this
case
the
district
court
estimated
that
the
average
claim
when
trebled
would
range
from
$3.00
or
so
to
$20.00.
that’s
the
average
that
the
range
of
the
averages
after
trebling.
as
against
that,
the
cost
of
administration
would
be
very
substantial.
the
district
court
said
$500,000.00,
that
was
several
years
ago
before
the
effects
of
recent
inflation.
now,
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
they’re
bound
to
be
problems
of
manageability
even
beyond
the
inherent
problem
of
whether
you’re
going
to
turn
courthouses
into
coliseums,
as
the
second
circuit
has
said,
in
order
to
administer
two
million
claims.
the
testimony
of
deputy
clerk
murphy
in
the
record
here,
as
to
the
experience
of
what
that
court
and
its
clerk’s
office
went
through
in
the
drug
cases
where
there
was
a
settlement,
not
a
litigation,
will
show
i
think
this
court
some
of
the
inherent
problems
of
manageability
that
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
as
mr.
milburn
has
stated
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
there’s
no
formula.
now,
judge
tyler
did
assume
for
the
purposes
of
estimating
the
damaged
claims,
and
only
for
the
purpose
of
estimating,
5%,
5%
overcharge
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
he
reached
the
outlandish
figures
that
he
did.
that
was
not
based
on
evidence.
it
cannot
be
based
on
evidence
because
as
mr.
milburn
said,
there
is
such
a
diversity
of
orders.
there
is
such
a
diversity
of
expense
involved
in
executing
diverse
orders
that
no
simple
formula
of
excess
is
possible.
in
each
case,
you
have
to
see
what
kind
of
an
order
the
man
put
in,
how
long
it
took
to
execute
it,
and
consider
all
the
other
factors
there
involved.
this
case
is
not
susceptible
of
a
simple
formula,
as
has
been
the
case
in
other
situations.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
it
would
require
individual
claims,
and
that’s
another
reason
why
it’s
unmanageable.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
no,
your
honor,
they
don’t
have
to
come
in
person,
but
they
do
have
to
communicate
with
the
court
and
with
the
clerk’s
office
and
we
know
the
difficulties
from
other
situations.
the
mystification
that
these
class
members
have
when
they
receive
a
notice,
they
call
it
the
clerk
as
deputy
clerk
murphy
testified
and
said
“what’s
it
mean?
explain
it
to
us.”
and
some
of
them
sometime
it’s
called
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
of
course
your
honor.
it’s
not
a
question
of
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
not
a
question
of
the
physical
space
in
the
courtroom,
but
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
--
but
the
court’s
facilities
and
its
auspices
and
its
personnel.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
and
this
was
the
basic
difference
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
is
the
question
whether
a
rule
of
procedure
may
be
used
to
effect
changes
in
substantive
law.
the
court
of
appeals,
we
submit,
correctly
held
no,
and
in
doing
so
it
reversed
district
court
determinations,
which
were
based
on
the
premise
that
in
the
interest
of
liberal
interpretation
of
rule
23
and
in
the
interest
of
punishing
alleged
wrongdoers,
this
case
must
proceed
as
a
class
action
at
any
price.
and
the
price,
which
the
district
court
exacted,
was
the
bending
and
indeed
the
breaking
of
established
constitutional
and
legal
principles
of
substantive
law,
all
in
order
to
let
mr.
eisen
act
as
the
self-appointed
champion
of
the
rights
of
six
million
class
members
scattered
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
free
world.
now,
rule
23
was
utilized
to
order
substantive
law
in
this
case
by
the
district
court,
we
submit,
on
the
three
points
of
notice
which
was
woefully
inadequate
under
the
rule
and
under
the
constitution
as
mr.
milburn
has
said.
secondly,
by
the
creation
of
the
fluid
recovery
device
for
the
class
as
a
whole;
thirdly,
by
the
preliminary
hearing
on
the
merits
followed
by
an
order
that
the
defendants
pay
forthwith
without
recovery,
90%
of
the
cost
of
communicating
with
the
class.
and
these
radical
departures
from
substantive
law
were
decreed
by
the
district
court,
because
otherwise,
the
action
was
plainly
unmanageable
as
a
class
action,
as
plaintiff’s
counsel
conceded
at
196
of
the
appendix,
when
he
urged
a
fluid
recovery,
because
he
said
that
if
each
of
the
six
million
class
members
had
to
present
his
own
personal
claim
for
damages,
the
class
indeed
would
not
be
manageable.
now,
we
submit,
your
honors
that
it’s
really
not
at
all
significant
that
class
actions
had
their
origins
in
equity.
they’re
still
procedural
devices
and
that
is
the
whole
thrust
of
rule
23.
its
purpose
as
can
be
divined
from
its
face,
and
as
appears
from
the
notes
of
the
revisers,
which
are
printed
at
pages
18
in
following
of
the
supplementary
appendix,
was
that
rule
23
was
designed
to
provide
a
means
of
bringing
together
in
a
single
forum,
existing
claims,
large
or
small,
of
actual
individual
plaintiffs
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
judicial
economy
and
efficiency,
and
uniformity
of
decision,
where
it
is
possible
to
do
so
without
sacrificing
procedural
fairness.
this
rule,
i
submit
your
honors,
confers
no
substantive
rights
on
any
litigant.
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
this
rule
are
the
courts.
the
purpose
is
to
avoid
the
multiple
litigation
of
claims
which
otherwise
would
be
litigated
in
different
forums.
the
purpose
is
to
assist
the
judiciary
and
incidentally
to
reduce
its
case
load.
there
is
nothing
in
rule
23
or
in
its
history
about
facilitating
retribution
for
wrongdoers,
alleged
wrongdoers.
there
is
nothing
in
the
rule
that
tilts
the
scales
for
or
against
plaintiffs
or
defendants,
as
is
assumed
by
some
commentators
and
was
assumed
by
the
district
court.
mr.
fine’s
discourse
on
flexible
remedies
and
his
citation
this
morning
of
the
borak
case
as
an
example
of
the
creativeness
of
the
federal
judiciary
in
not
letting
wrongs
go
unpunished,
rather
misses
the
point,
because
all
of
his
cases,
including
the
borak
case
didn’t
each
--
reach
the
question
of
creating
a
flexible
or
inventive
remedy
for
ill-gotten
gains,
until
after
liability
had
been
determined
on
the
merits.
and
those
cases
are
not
properly
considerable
in
determining
at
the
outset
of
a
litigation
whether
the
suit
should
be
permitted
to
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
or
not.
the
rule
of
course,
as
this
court
well
knows,
was
promulgated
under
the
rules
enabling
act,
which
provides
in
very
specific
terms
that
such
rules
may
not,
shall
not
abridge
in
large
or
modify
any
substantive
right
and
shall
preserve
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
now,
in
the
pending
of
substantive
law
as
to
notice
requirements,
in
that
area
i’d
like
to
add
a
few
words
to
what
mr.
milburn
has
already
said.
mr.
fine
has
attempted
to
avoid
the
notice
problems,
indeed
the
manageability
problems
by
suggesting
that
this
case
could
well
be
a
(b)
(1)
or
a
(b)
(2)
case,
rather
than
a
(b)
(3)
case.
well,
i
think
it’s
significant
that
all
judges
who
have
considered
this
case,
including
judge
tyler
have
agreed
that
this
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
(b)
(3)
case.
judge
tyler
certainly
found
to
this
effect
in
his
first
opinion
in
1966
at
95
of
the
appendix,
in
which
he
said
that
notice
was
required
by
the
rule,
and
the
rule
of
course
requires
notice
in
(b)
(3)
actions.
beyond
that,
mr.
fine
seeks
to
put
this
case
into
the
(b)
(1)
or
(b)
(2)
category
by
arguing
that
it’s
really
an
injunctive
case.
well
let’s
look
at
that.
the
injunction,
the
injunctive
claims,
claim
for
injunctive
relief
is
appended
to
a
claim
for
money
damages,
and
what
is
sought
to
be
enjoined
by
this
complaint
is
the
odd-lot
differential
which
was
established
in
1951
and
permitted
by
the
sec.
now,
since
that
time
that
differential
has
been
twice
changed,
first,
in
1966
at
the
express
direction
of
the
sec
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
and
then
later
in
1972
by
a
rule
of
the
exchange
itself.
so
it
is
evident
i
think,
that
the
claim
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
complaint
is
now
moot.
in
any
event,
judge
tyler
in
basing
his
estimate
of
damage
claims
in
this
case,
for
the
period
1962
to
1966,
did
so
by
comparison
with
the
1966
rate
as
the
proper
rate.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
suggestion
of
this
late
date,
that
this
is
an
injunctive
case,
flies
in
the
face
of
the
facts
and
in
view
of
the
obvious
problems
which
this
case
creates
for
itself,
because
it’s
essentially
a
money
damage
case.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
believe
he
intimated
that
that
was
the
case.
i
don’t
know
of
any
such
case.
i
don’t
think
that
that
result
could
be
constitutionally
defended
if
there
were
truly
adversarial
situations,
such
as
there
is
here,
in
which
a
large
class
of
consumers
seeks
to
in
effect
to
recover
against
the
supplier.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
or
give
the
notice.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
turning
to
the
next
invention
of
substantive
law
which
we
believe
to
be
completely
unjustified
by
rule
23
and
its
true
purposes,
i
come
to
the
question
of
the
so-called
fluid
recovery
for
the
class
as
a
whole.
now
of
course
it’s
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
law
that
money
damages
are
recoverable
only
by
persons
who
are
injured
by
illegal
conduct
who
can
prove
damages
flowing
from
such
conduct.
and
this
principle
is
of
course
enacted
in
the
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
which
is
here
involved,
any
person
injured
in
his
business
and
property,
and
so
on.
and
the
same
principle
of
compensatory
recovery
is
recognized
in
the
line
of
cases
which
have
construed
section
6
of
the
exchange
act
which
is
here
alleged
to
be
the
basis
for
the
exchanges'
liability.
but,
the
plaintiff
has
conceded
that
this
case
could
not
proceed
as
a
class
action
if
this
fundamental
principle
of
substantive
law
were
to
be
observed,
if
all
class
members
were
required
to
prove
their
damages,
and
it
was
on
this
basis
in
order
to
save
the
class
action
at
all
costs
that
the
district
court
ruled
that
it
would
make
an
award
of
damages
to
the
class
as
a
whole,
that
class
members
could
file
claims
and
prove
their
damages
and
if
they
did
so,
they
could
recover
damages,
but
for
the
great
bulk
of
the
class
as
a
whole,
the
differential
would
be
reduced
in
the
future
until
the
total
award
was
exhausted.
well
now,
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
class
as
a
whole.
a
class
is
not
an
entity
which
is
entitled
to
collect
damages
in
its
own
right.
a
class
is
a
collection
of
claimants,
and
that
we
think
is
the
teaching
of
this
court’s
decision
in
snyder
versus
harris
at
394
u.s.
an
award
of
damages
to
the
class
as
whole
by
reduction
of
the
differential
in
the
future
would
do
two
things.
first,
it
would
benefit
future
purchasers
and
sellers
of
odd-lots
who
are
not
purchasers
and
sellers
in
1962
to
1966,
and
thus
not
members
of
the
class
and
thus
not
persons
who
are
injured
by
any
of
the
defendant’s
allegedly
illegal
conduct.
and
secondly,
such
a
device
would
not
compensate
past
traders
who
may
not
trade
in
the
future.
and
furthermore,
this
device
except
as
to
those
few
class
members
who
might
file
claims
were
denied
to
the
defendants
of
their
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
damaged
issues
and
i
refer
to
this
court’s
case
decision
in
curtis
against
loether
of
last
week.
in
addition,
what
the
district
court
proposed
here
by
way
of
a
rate
reduction
in
the
future
would
plainly
usurp
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
sec
under
the
exchange
act.
courts
have
no
power
to
fix
odd-lot
rates
in
the
first
instance
under
the
congressional
scheme
of
regulation
of
exchanges
expressed
in
the
exchange
act.
that
function
is
confided
to
the
sec
and
the
statute
enacts
standards
which
must
be
applied
for
rate
making
under
its
mandate.
and
the
court’s
injection
of
itself
into
this
area
of
rate
making
is
contrary
to
the
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
forbid
judicial
intrusion
into
areas
reserved
by
statute
for
agency
expertise.
finally,
in
the
catalog
of
substantive
law
changes
effected
in
the
name
of
rule
23,
we
come
to
the
preliminary
hearing
on
the
merits,
and
the
resulting
order
that
the
defendants
should
pay
90%
of
the
cost
of
giving
notice.
this
of
course,
we
believe
to
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
defendants
fifth
amendment
rights
to
due
process
and
their
seventh
amendment
rights
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes.
any
order
to
pay
any
part
of
the
cost,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
a
poor
man’s
case,
even
though
mr.
eisen
is
not
willing
to
pay
the
cost
of
notice.
after
all,
he
is
an
investor
in
odd-lots
of
stock
on
the
exchange.
but
certainly,
the
analogy
to
the
in
forma
pauperis
case
is
not
implied.
i’m
quite
aware
that
on
occasion,
courts
do
order
the
opposite
party
to
advance
certain
costs,
but
those
i
don’t
believe
that
this
practice
is
generally
resorted
to
where
it’s
apparent
that
the
costs
can
never
be
recovered,
as
is
the
case
here.
we
have
a
bill
of
cost
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
some
$11,000.00
which
will
never
be
recovered.
and
i
don’t
think
that
it’s
possible
to
say
as
mr.
fine
does,
well
this
is
no
worse
than
discovery
costs.
everybody
realizes
that
this
is
an
incident
of
litigation.
i
agree
that
in
a
litigation,
every
party
has
to
pay
his
own
cost
of
discovery,
whether
it’s
five
million
for
twa,
or
what,
but
that’s
quite
different
from
compelling
a
party
to
pay
his
adversary’s
cost,
the
cost
of
financing
the
litigation
against
him,
and
these
costs
of
giving
notice
are
those
which
should
be
borne
by
the
plaintiff,
because
he
has
elected
to
represent
this
class.
in
order
to
be
an
adequate
representative,
he
surely
has
to
communicate
with
them.
that
is
his
expense,
and
there
certainly
is
no
warrant
for
putting
all
that
expense
on
the
defendants.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
there’s
nothing
to
prevent
that.
he
can
proceed
individually.
in
times
gone
by
when
there
was
not
such
an
allure
for
class
actions,
people
did
proceed
individually
as
test
cases,
where
there
was
some
substantial
principle
to
be
vindicated,
there’s
nothing
to
prevent
that
here.
furthermore,
he
has
the
prospect
of
treble
damages,
and
more
than
that
his
legal
fees
will
be
paid
for,
because
they’re
not
limited
under
the
case
law
by
the
amount
of
his
recovery.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
if
he
wins,
yes
your
honor,
only
if
he
wins.
if
he
loses,
he
takes
the
chance
of
every
litigant.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
that’s
right
mr.
chief
justice.
they
are
not.
they
are
asking
to
be
let
alone.
mr.
fine
argued,
rather
eloquently
i
thought,
that
the
exchange
should
be
made
to
pay
all
of
the
costs,
because
it
failed
to
protect
investors.
well
now,
he’s
trying
to
uphold
the
decision
of
judge
tyler,
but
judge
tyler
didn’t
find
any
such
thing
as
that,
nor
is
there
any
sec
determination
that
the
exchange
failed
to
protect
the
investors.
indeed,
the
very
differential
complaint
of
here
was
permitted
to
go
into
effect
by
the
sec
in
1951,
and
in
1966,
it
was
changed
at
the
direction
of
the
sec.
mr.
fine
has
also
attempted
to
justify
settling
the
cost
of
notice
on
the
exchange
alone,
by
analogizing
the
case
to
those
involving
corporations
where
judge
medina
rightly
said
“this
may
be
a
situation
where
the
plaintiffs
don’t
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
notice,
where
they’re
shareholders
in
the
corporation.”
well
it’s
perfectly
obvious
i
think
that
there
is
no
proper
analogy
between
shareholders
of
a
corporation
who
own
the
corporation,
and
customers
of
member
firms
of
the
exchange.
now,
the
final
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
the
cost
of
individual
notice
to
the
readily
identifiable
members
of
the
class?
i
should
say
your
honor,
if
that
were
the
case,
that
notice
would
not
be
an
obstacle
to
the
class
as
continuing.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
i
think
the
question
of
manageability,
your
honor.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
oh!
yes.
consider
the
problem
is
posed
by
very
large
class
actions
where
the
alleged
class
is
enormous,
as
is
true
here,
and
where
each
individual
member
of
that
class
possesses
a
very
small
claim.
that
is
this
case
and
that
is
the
case
which
is
very
difficult
to
manage.
why
is
that,
because
the
claims
are
so
small.
in
this
case
the
district
court
estimated
that
the
average
claim
when
trebled
would
range
from
$3.00
or
so
to
$20.00.
that’s
the
average
that
the
range
of
the
averages
after
trebling.
as
against
that,
the
cost
of
administration
would
be
very
substantial.
the
district
court
said
$500,000.00,
that
was
several
years
ago
before
the
effects
of
recent
inflation.
now,
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
they’re
bound
to
be
problems
of
manageability
even
beyond
the
inherent
problem
of
whether
you’re
going
to
turn
courthouses
into
coliseums,
as
the
second
circuit
has
said,
in
order
to
administer
two
million
claims.
the
testimony
of
deputy
clerk
murphy
in
the
record
here,
as
to
the
experience
of
what
that
court
and
its
clerk’s
office
went
through
in
the
drug
cases
where
there
was
a
settlement,
not
a
litigation,
will
show
i
think
this
court
some
of
the
inherent
problems
of
manageability
that
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
as
mr.
milburn
has
stated
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
there’s
no
formula.
now,
judge
tyler
did
assume
for
the
purposes
of
estimating
the
damaged
claims,
and
only
for
the
purpose
of
estimating,
5%,
5%
overcharge
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
he
reached
the
outlandish
figures
that
he
did.
that
was
not
based
on
evidence.
it
cannot
be
based
on
evidence
because
as
mr.
milburn
said,
there
is
such
a
diversity
of
orders.
there
is
such
a
diversity
of
expense
involved
in
executing
diverse
orders
that
no
simple
formula
of
excess
is
possible.
in
each
case,
you
have
to
see
what
kind
of
an
order
the
man
put
in,
how
long
it
took
to
execute
it,
and
consider
all
the
other
factors
there
involved.
this
case
is
not
susceptible
of
a
simple
formula,
as
has
been
the
case
in
other
situations.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
it
would
require
individual
claims,
and
that’s
another
reason
why
it’s
unmanageable.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
no,
your
honor,
they
don’t
have
to
come
in
person,
but
they
do
have
to
communicate
with
the
court
and
with
the
clerk’s
office
and
we
know
the
difficulties
from
other
situations.
the
mystification
that
these
class
members
have
when
they
receive
a
notice,
they
call
it
the
clerk
as
deputy
clerk
murphy
testified
and
said
“what’s
it
mean?
explain
it
to
us.”
and
some
of
them
sometime
it’s
called
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
of
course
your
honor.
it’s
not
a
question
of
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
not
a
question
of
the
physical
space
in
the
courtroom,
but
--
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
--
but
the
court’s
facilities
and
its
auspices
and
its
personnel.
