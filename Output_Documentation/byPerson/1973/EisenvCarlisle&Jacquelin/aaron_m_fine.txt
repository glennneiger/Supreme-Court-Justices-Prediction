mr.
aaron
m.
fine
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
to
review
its
decision
dismissing
the
action
as
a
class
action.
the
grant
of
certiorari
requested
the
parties
to
brief
and
to
argue
in
addition
to
the
questions
presented,
a
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
other
questions,
include
the
manageability
of
the
large
class
action,
who
must
be
given
notice,
who
should
pay
for
the
notice
and
the
scope
of
discretion
of
the
district
court.
turning
first
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals,
jurisdiction
was
asserted
on
two
grounds.
first
of
all,
the
court
in
1968
in
reversing
the
district
court
said
that
it
retained
jurisdiction
and
secondly,
the
defendants
say
that
it
has
jurisdiction
anyway
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
originally,
jurisdiction
was
assumed
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
what
became
known
as
the
“"death
knell"”
doctrine
when
the
class
action
in
the
first
instance
was
dismissed
by
judge
tyler
in
the
district
court,
and
on
the
plaintiff’s
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
to
dismiss
the
class
action
would
in
effect
bring
it
to
an
end,
and
the
class
would
never
get
any
chance
of
review.
now,
if
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
was
incorrectly
decided,
later
when
the
case
was
decided
on
the
merits
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
what
became
known
as
eisen
ii,
when
it
said
“we
retain
jurisdiction,”
it
would
obviously
have
had
no
jurisdiction
to
retain,
and
the
defendants
concede
that.
we
however,
adhere
to
our
view
originally
expressed
in
our
position
to
their
petition
for
certiorari
before
this
court
and
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
came
up
for
review,
and
that
petition
was
denied,
that
it
was
soundly
decided
by
the
second
circuit.
now
it
has
been
considerably
eroded
since
then.
for
example,
the
third
circuit
in
hackett
against
general
host
corporation,
rejected
it
entirely.
but
what
happened
in
hackett
i
think
shows
how
wise
the
second
circuit
was
in
adopting
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
because
after
hackett
refused
to
hear
the
appeal
in
that
consumer
antitrust
case
brought
by
a
and
on
behalf
of
purchasers
of
bread
following
a
conviction
for
price
fixing
in
the
philadelphia
area.
the
case
was
dropped
by
the
plaintiff,
because
it
couldn’t
proceed
without
having
a
class
action
to
support
it
and
consequently,
the
question
of
the
class
never
got
to
be
reviewed.
our
submission
is
different.
we
submit
that
while
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
reversing
the
district
court,
when
the
district
court
dismissed
the
class
action,
that
it
retained
jurisdiction,
what
it
actually
did
was
to
relinquish
jurisdiction
because
it
reversed.
and
this
is
unlike
cases
where
court
of
appeals
may
remand
the
record
for
further
findings
because
the
record
before
it
is
insufficient
to
enable
it
to
render
a
decision
and
meanwhile,
no
decision
is
rendered.
here,
a
decision
was
rendered
so
that
the
court
said
it
retained
jurisdiction,
but
it
really
didn’t.
in
fact,
the
defendants
were
so
confused
about
their
role
that
when
they
came
up
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
final
time,
this
time
trying
to
reverse
the
district
court,
because
the
district
court
had
sustained
the
class
action
in
every
respect,
they
didn’t
know
who
they
were,
and
they
designated
themselves
as
appellees
even
though
they
have
lost.
so
there
is
a
complete
paradox
and
anomaly,
and
the
court
of
appeals
having
rendered
this
decision
saying
in
fact
that
it
retained
it.
turning
to
the
collateral
order
doctrine
under
cohen,
that
has
no
application
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
class
action
determination
is,
in
the
language
of
cohen,
but
a
step
toward
the
final
judgment
in
which
it
will
merge.
rule
23
(c)
prescribes
that
judgment
will
be
entered
for/or
against
the
class,
as
the
court
recently
noted
in
its
opinion
in
american
pipe
against
the
state
of
utah.
and
it
is
a
step
which
has
to
be
taken
in
every
class
action,
because
under
rule
23
(c)
1,
the
court
is
required
as
soon
as
practicable
after
the
class
action
is
brought
to
make
the
class
action
determination.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
it’s
unreviewable
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
reached
out
to
decide
all
sorts
of
questions
that
were
only
tentatively
decided
by
the
district
court
that
were
not
ripe
for
decision,
and
that
should
have
awaited
a
complete
record
in
the
district
court
in
the
same
way
as
many
decisions
of
the
district
court
are
not
reviewable
in
initial
stages
of
the
case.
and
in
any
event,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
in
his
concurrence
in
the
state
of
utah
case,
rule
23
specifically
provides
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
sustaining
the
class,
or
even
denying
the
class
maybe
altered
or
amended
prior
to
decision
on
the
merits,
and
judge
tyler
in
fact
said
in
his
opinion
on
which
he
was
reversed
here
that
the
response
to
the
kind
of
notice
that
he
had
ordered
might
prompt
him
to
change
his
mind
and
disallow
the
class,
so
that
this
is
the
kind
of
order
that
cohen
certainly
doesn’t
contemplate
will
be
reviewed
now,
because
it
might
be
changed.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
yes,
your
honor.
cohen
and
gillespie,
they
held
there
that
this
was
in
effect
something
that
would
irreparably
harm
the
class,
because
this
was
the
only
way
the
class
could
get
review.
it’s
like
the
case
where
an
attachment
is
released
and
unless
there’s
immediate
review,
the
object
of
the
attachment
maybe
gone.
but
here,
the
congress
is
that
the
defendant's
preserve
their
right
to
review,
which
the
plaintiff
didn’t
have
in
cohen,
and
wouldn’t
have
had
if
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
hadn’t
been
applied.
the
defendants
at
the
end
of
this
case,
when
judgment
is
entered
will
have
the
right
to
review
on
all
of
these
questions,
and
at
that
point
it
could
very
well
be
that
judge
tyler
will
have
modified
his
order,
will
have
reduced
the
class,
might
have
eliminated
the
class
entirely,
changed
it
in
many
possible
ways.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
that’s
no
different,
your
honor,
from
discovery
orders.
for
example,
in
twa
against
hughes.
the
defendant
there
was
ordered
to
comply
with
discovery
which
the
defendant
said
would
cost
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
are
filed
in
this
court
$5
million,
but
nevertheless,
the
discovery
order,
as
all
discovery
orders
are
held
to
be,
was
held
to
be
interlocutory
and
not
appealable,
and
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
because
the
rule
doesn’t
impose
the
burden
of
costs
on
the
plaintiff.
it
says
the
court
shall
direct
notice
to
the
class,
and
so
it
obviously,
unless
the
court
is
the
one
that
is
supposed
to
pay
for
notice
under
that
specific
language.
it
obviously
gives
the
court
the
power
to
decide
who
should
pay
for
the
notice.
and
here,
just
like
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
may
be
subjected
to
the
cost
on
preparing
to
try
an
antitrust
case
have
to
pay
for
the
transcript,
have
to
pay
for
discovery,
but
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
plaintiff
isn’t
required
and
cannot
be
required
to
put
up
any
security
for
those
costs.
the
defendant
there
as
the
defendant
here
has
to
look
to
whatever
judgment
is
entered
at
the
end
of
the
case
in
its
favor
if
such
a
judgment
is
entered,
and
collecting
that
judgment
if
it
gets
a
judgment
for
costs
that
should
not
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
some
instances
for
example,
where
a
master
is
appointed
and
the
parties
are
required
to
advance
the
expenses
of
the
master
before
the
end
of
the
case,
and
there
may
be
a
division
i
think
under
the
equity
powers,
under
rule
54
(b)
to
allocate
those
costs.
but
in
any
event,
this
is
no
different
from
the
discovery
cases
from
the
standpoint
of
finality
on
appeal
because
you
may
recall
that
hickman
versus
taylor
came
before
this
court,
because
mr.
fortenbaugh,
the
philadelphia
lawyer
who
was
asserting
the
privilege
against
producing
his
work
products
papers
there,
had
to
undergo
a
citation
for
contempt
before
he
could
get
review.
we
are
not
at
this
stage
in
this
case.
the
defendants
have
not
said
whether
they
will
comply
with
the
order
or
they
won’t
comply
with
the
order
and
certainly,
this
is
no
different
from
the
discovery
cases.
for
example,
united
states
versus
ibm
which
is
before
you
on
petition
for
certiorari.
until
the
defendants
have
taken
some
irrevocable
step
with
respect
to
the
order
of
the
district
court.
suppose
they
say
“we
won’t
put
up
the
costs?”
well,
there
are
all
sorts
of
alternatives.
they
might
be
held
in
contempt,
in
which
case
depending
i
suppose
on
whether
it’s
civil
or
criminal
contempt
under
the
ibm
case,
they
might
have
a
right
to
review.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
might
say,
“well,
if
they
won’t
put
up
the
costs,
we
are
going
to
say
that
this
would
have
the
effect
of
a
rule
23
class
action
even
without
notice
to
the
class
for
certain
results,
for
example,
for
binding
the
defendants
as
against
the
prospect
of
one
way
intervention,
and
so
on.”
so
that
this
is
no
different
certainly
from
the
discovery
cases
even
if
it
were
thought
to
be
slightly
different
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant’s
advancing
costs
at
this
point,
from
the
standpoint
of
finality.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
doubt
it
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
move
us
back
to
the
district
court
and
under
his
powers
expressly
given
under
rule
23,
judge
tyler
hopefully
would
then
say
that
he
was
wrong
the
first
time,
he
was
right
the
second
time
and
would
reinstate
his
second
decision
upholding
the
class.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
to
another
distinction
in
cohen
that
involved
the
general
applicability
of
a
statute,
and
the
question
in
cohen
as
phrased
by
another
panel
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
weight
watchers
case
was
whether
a
decision
will
settle
a
point
once
for
all
as
it
did
in
cohen,
or
will
open
the
way
to
a
flood
of
appeals
concerning
the
propriety
of
a
district
court’s
ruling
on
the
facts
of
a
particular
suit.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
held
that
in
some
cases,
costs
can
be
imposed
on
the
defendants.
cases
where
they
may
have
a
duty,
for
example,
a
corporation’s
duty
to
its
stockholders,
but
here,
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
in
some
cases,
the
district
court
may
impose
cost
in
others
and
particularly
in
this
case,
they
said
it’s
inappropriate.
so
what
they
are
really
doing
is
interfering
with
the
district
court’s
discretion
depending
on
how
they
view
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
furthermore,
turning
really,
not
to
the
question
of
appealability,
but
advancing
somewhat
to
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
putting
the
cost
on
the
defense,
here
the
district
court
found
in
these
findings
were
not
upset
by
the
court
of
appeals,
because
the
court
simply
said
the
district
court
didn’t
have
jurisdiction
to
make
them,
that
the
new
york
stock
exchange
had
violated
its
duty
under
the
exchange
act
to
protect
the
odd-lot
investors
who
are
the
class
in
this
case.
and
the
violation
of
that
duty,
in
which
it
was
aided
and
abetted
by
the
other
defendants,
certainly
is
no
different
from
the
kind
of
duty
were
no
less
in
scope
than
the
duty
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
could
be
the
basis
for
putting
costs
on
the
defendants
in
another
kind
of
case.
so
for
that
reason,
cohen
doesn’t
apply
because
this
is
really
a
decision
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
many
district
courts
have
routinely
since
rule
23
was
amended,
allocated
the
costs
between
the
parties
without
any
thought
that
they
were
doing
anything
wrong,
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
says
in
some
cases
they
should
be
able
to
do
that.
so
that
i
submit
that
a
general
rule
which
this
court
would
be
asked
to
apply,
that
in
no
case
can
costs
be
allocated,
should
not
be
adopted,
and
since
the
question
of
a
general
rule
isn’t
involved,
the
defendants
had
no
right
of
appeal.
now,
turning
to
the
issue
of
manageability
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
in
the
fifth
circuit
it’s
recognized.
i
believe
there
are
number
of
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
it’s
been
recognized,
but
i
think
that
the
two
circuits
which
have
definitely
ruled
on
it
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
--
for
and
against
on
are
the
second
and
the
third.
on
the
issue
of
manageability,
it’s
not
an
issue
at
all
in
class
actions
maintained
under
23
(b)
102,
which
would
be
for
example,
actions
for
an
accounting,
for
a
trust
fund,
or
here
an
action
for
injunctive
relief.
and
the
second
circuit,
just
summarily,
in
its
first
decision
where
it
reversed
dismissal
of
the
class
action
said
this
can’t
be
a
(b)
(2)
action
because
the
advisory
committee
note
says
that
that
doesn’t
apply
to
situations
exclusively
or
predominantly
for
the
recovery
of
damages.
now,
this
case
isn’t
exclusively
or
predominantly
for
the
recovery
of
damages.
this
case
seeks
and
has
sought
from
the
very
first
in
the
complaint
requests,
very
substantial
injunctive
relief.
for
example,
the
sec
special
study
of
the
odd-lot
markets
which
was
the
basis
really
for
this
case,
found
that
an
engineering
firm
ebasco
had
concluded
in
1955
that
very
large
cost
savings
could
be
put
into
effect
if
the
odd-lot
defendants
automated
their
operations.
and
judge
tyler
found
in
july
of
1972
that
as
of
that
date,
those
recommendations
have
not
only
not
been
implemented,
they
hadn’t
even
been
considered,
so
there
is
still
a
substantial
need
for
injunctive
relief
here
to
reduce
the
costs
of
the
odd-lot
defendants,
because
as
the
court
found,
reduction
of
those
costs
would
necessarily
have
a
beneficial
result
for
the
class,
because
it
would
mean
that
the
odd-lot
differential,
which
is
the
basis
of
this
case,
a
charge
that
it
was
inflated
and
fixed
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
would
necessarily
be
affected
and
reduced.
yet
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
out
the
(b)
(2)
action
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
manageability
enters
into
the
rule
only
under
(b)
(3)
actions
those
that
are
what
were
formerly
known
as
spurious
class
actions,
but
since
your
decision
in
the
utah
case
are
known
as
truly
representative
suits
like
all
of
the
others.
and
manageability
in
(b)
(3)
actions
under
the
language
of
the
rule
is
only
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
deciding
whether
the
class
action
is
superior
to
other
available
methods
for
the
fair
and
efficient
adjudication
of
the
controversy.
and
here,
the
court
of
appeals
said
both
in
the
"death
knell"
opinion
and
in
the
second
opinion
that
the
class
action
is
the
only
feasible
method
for
adjudicating
this
controversy,
because
the
individual
class
members,
like
eisen
have
such
small
states
that
they’re
not
going
to
come
forward
with
individual
suits.
and
yet,
having
held
twice
that
this
is
the
only
feasible
method,
and
the
rule
saying
that
manageability
is
only
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
whether
the
class
action
is
superior
to
other
available
methods,
the
court
of
appeals
dismisses
it
as
the
class
action.
aside
from
the
language
of
the
rule
itself,
however,
the
difficulties
of
management
which
the
court
of
appeals
perceived
in
this
action
are
just
not
so.
first
of
all,
it
didn’t
even
consider
what
the
rule
specifically
provides
and
that
is
that
you
can
have
a
class
action
on
the
common
question
of
liability.
that
part
of
the
class
action
is
certainly
sound.
but
here,
the
district
court
also
found
that
gross
damages
can
be
determined
that
on
the
basis
of
a
common
formula,
and
estimated
for
the
entire
class.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
odd-lot
defendants
know
exactly
what
they
charged
to
the
class
as
a
whole,
because
the
charge
was
their
income,
and
if
the
district
court
is
right
that
the
formula
can
be
adopted,
then
we
know
what
part
of
that
total
charge,
that
aggregate
charge
was
an
over
charge.
now,
certainly,
as
to
the
two
million
and
the
quarter
class
members
whose
individual
transactions,
the
defendant
stipulated
are
recorded
on
computer
tapes
and
can
be
derived
from
those
computer
tapes.
constituting
56%
of
the
transactions
of
the
class
as
a
whole,
what
is
the
difficulty
in
managing
that
if
you
have
a
formula
that
you
can
apply
across
the
board?
this
is
no
different
from
the
utility
cases
where
refunds
are
routinely
ordered
when
some
rate
is
found
to
have
been
too
high.
and
in
fact,
in
the
panhandle
eastern
pipeline
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
refunds
were
made
to
over
a
million
ultimate
consumers
with
reasonable
promptness
and
without
serious
controversy
under
the
supervision
of
a
master.
similarly
in
the
illinois
bell
telephone
case
in
the
days
when
people
have
to
copy
records
like
bob
crotchet
sitting
on
a
stool,
and
before
the
days
of
the
computer,
refunds
were
made
of
$17
million
to
over
a
million
people
entitled
to
the
refunds.
so
if
you
have
a
formula,
there’s
really
no
great
problem
in
managing,
especially
with
the
assistance
of
data
processing,
and
from
personal
experience
i
know
that
these
burdens
do
not
fall
necessarily
on
the
court,
they
are
assumed
by
counsel,
by
accountants,
and
by
data
processing
firms.
and
here,
you
have
two
and
a
quarter
million
class
members
who
stand
to
receive
and
recover
a
tangible
amount
without
undue
difficulties
of
management.
but
they
have
been
put
out
of
court,
because
the
court
of
appeals
erroneously
concluded
and
held
that
judge
tyler
had
said
“that
the
only
way
that
this
class
could
be
managed
would
be
by
the
so-called
fluid
recovery.”
that
is
a
future
reduction
of
the
odd-lot
differential.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
comes
up
in
two
contexts,
first
in
a
settlement
or
after
final
judgment.
now,
in
a
settlement
context
they
are
usually
compensated
out
of
the
fund.
if
it
comes
up
after
the
final
judgment,
then
the
defendants
under
such
decisions
of
this
court
as
mills
against
the
electric
auto-lite
company
are
liable
for
the
costs.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right.
that
only
comes
up
at
the
time
of
distribution,
which
is
after
settlement
or
judgment.
now,
it’s
true
that
the
plaintiff’s
counsel
suggested
in
the
district
court
that
if
six
million
class
members
have
to
go
through
that
ancient
records,
and
he
said
“in
that
narrow
sense,
it
would
be
impracticable.”
so
he
suggested
what
became
known
as
the
fluid
class
recovery
that
is
equitable
relief,
fashioning
a
remedy
for
future
reduction
of
the
odd-lot
differential,
and
that
would
benefit
certainly
odd-lot
investors
as
whole
and
those
who
overlapped
the
class
who
would
pay
the
overcharge
during
the
period
in
the
suit.
the
district
court
didn’t
adopt
that
saying
only
it
merited
consideration
that
individual
claims
could
be
satisfied
to
the
extent
filed,
that
the
fluid
class
recovery
might
then
be
appropriate
for
distribution
of
the
unclaimed
remainders.
and
if
you
have
the
formula
kind
of
distribution
for
those
whose
identities
are
on
tape,
then
you
may
even
be
able
to
cut
out
a
large
part
of
the
claims
procedure.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
i
think
there
are
many
alternatives
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
defendants
could
say
it
should
go
back
to
them,
and
they
will
have
the
opportunity
to
argue
that
after
judgment
is
entered
as
the
rule
contemplates
for
the
total
amount
of
damages
for
the
class
as
a
whole.
secondly,
it
could
be
applied
to
reduce
the
odd-lot
differential
in
the
future.
it
could
be
done
under
the
general
equity
powers
of
the
court,
which
it
certainly
has
under
case
against
borak
to
fashion
any
remedy
to
make
the
securities
act
effective.
and
that’s
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
done
in
the
bebchick
case.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
wasn’t
a
class
action,
but
you
have
class
actions
where
the
same
approach
was
taken.
the
metro
homes
case
in
michigan
was
a
class
action
where
there
had
been
an
illegal
exaction
of
a
tax
than
held
to
be
unlawful,
and
there
the
court
held
that
the
taxing
authority
had
to
pay
over
the
entire
amount
and
couldn’t
get
back
any
part
of
the
amount
illegally
collected,
even
though
individuals
didn’t
come
forward
to
consume
the
entire
amount.
so
that
what
i’m
saying
is
that
although
bebchick
was
a
different
case,
it
provides
part
of
the
substantive
law,
the
equitable
principles
on
which
the
court
can
rely
in
fashioning
a
remedy
whether
the
action
is
a
class
action
or
not
a
class
action.
it
really
makes
no
difference
almost
mr.
justice
powell
to
make
another
answer
to
your
question.
suppose
notice
goes
out
to
the
two
million
and
then
there
is
a
judgment
liability
and
the
fund
is
created,
they
can
then
be
told
you
have
a
refund
due
to
you,
and
the
same
notice
can
be
published
for
those
who
can’t
be
identified,
assuming
that
they
will
read
the
notice.
and
if
you
like,
you
can
assign
your
claim
for
the
benefit
of
future
odd-lot
investors.
that’s
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
approved
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
pfizer
case.
so
there
are
all
sorts
of
possibilities,
but
certainly
at
this
point,
we
don’t
have
to
go
into
them,
because
that
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
people
with
small
claims
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
just
one
of
the
possibilities
to
be
considered
and
i
have
had
experience
in
class
actions
where
people
would
claim
of
as
much
as
$10.00
in
a
class
where
some
people
had
claims
of
thousands
of
dollars.
the
plumbing
fixtures
antitrust
case
pursued
their
claims
for
the
$10.00
just
as
diligently
as
those
with
the
bigger
claims.
it
meant
a
lot
to
them.
just
because
these
claims
are
small,
doesn’t
mean
that
it
doesn’t
mean
a
lot
to
these
investors.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
defendants
have
taken
full
page
ad
saying
they’re
addressed
to
the
odd-lot
investors
as
to
the
little
guys.
these
are
the
little
guys
that
people
who
do
not
have
by
and
large
enough
money
to
invest
very
much
and
so
these
small
amounts
do
mean
a
lot
to
them.
but
in
any
event,
that
was
all
tentative
and
not
necessarily
to
be
decided,
and
certainly
not
to
be
ruled
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
sort
of
advisory
opinion
basis.
now,
turning
to
individual
notice,
it’s
not
required
in
(b)
(2)
actions
for
an
injunction
and
under
the
decisions
like
hansberry
and
lee,
and
ben-hur
against
cauble,
adequacy
of
representation
is
the
hallmark
of
due
process
and
class
actions,
not
individual
notice.
for
example,
those
precluded
by
the
judgment
in
ben-hur
never
had
notice
of
the
prior
class
action
which
precluded
them.
under
(b)
(2),
individual
notice
is
not
required
by
the
rule,
and
the
defendants
concede
it.
now,
under
23
(c),
the
court
is
directed
direct
the
members
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances
including
individual
notice
to
all
members
who
can
be
identified
through
reasonable
effort.
it
doesn’t
mandate
individual
notice
where
it’s
not
practicable
or
where
identification
entails
more
than
a
reasonable
effort.
and
here,
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
held
that
the
claims
of
the
silent
members
of
the
class
are
more
theoretic
than
real,
they
are
not
going
to
want
to
have
an
opportunity
to
opt
out
to
conduct
their
own
litigation.
they’re
going
to
rely
on
the
class
and
the
results
of
the
class
so
that
the
kind
of
notice
ordered
by
the
district
court
here
certainly
conforms
to
the
language
of
the
rule
which
is
a
rule
of
reason,
that
it’s
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances,
because
to
have
a
requirement
of
any
other
kind
notice
and
the
case
where
the
class
consists
of
small
claimants
would
mean
that
the
class
action
rule
could
never
be
used
if
you
had
a
stringent
notice
requirement
to
protect
their
interests.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
(b)
(3)
action
where
that
kind
of
notice
required
a
(b)
(3)
actions
have
to
be
given.
now
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
it
could
be
looked
as
a
(b)
(2)
action
and
there
are
a
number
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
says
it
wasn’t.
i
say
it
was.
i
say
it
was
(b)
(2)
and
(b)
(3)
and
where
its
hybrid
that
exposed
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
(b)
(1)
where
it’s
hybrid.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
said
no.
no
(b)
(1)
either.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
there
are
a
number
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
that
say
that
if
it
can
be
viewed
as
(b)
(1)
or
(b)
(2),
you
view
it
as
(b)
(1)
or
(b)
(2)
even
if
it's
also
a
(b)
(3).
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
isn’t
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
if
you
must
look
at
it
as
a
(b)
(3)
action
then
the
question
is
what’s
reasonable
notice
within
the
intendment
of
the
rule,
and
what
are
the
interests
to
be
served
by
notice.
now
one
of
the
interests
to
be
served
by
individual
notice
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
it
says
the
court
shall
direct
to
the
members
of
the
class
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances.
and
in
mullane,
this
case
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
it
says
including
individual
notice
to
all
members
who
can
be
identified
through
a
reasonable
effort.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
but,
first
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
yes,
whatever
the
effort
and
whatever
the
circumstances.
first
of
all,
we
say
the
best
notice
of
practicable
under
the
circumstances
qualifies
the
rest
of
the
rule,
but
on
the
record
here,
even
if
it
doesn’t,
the
defendant’s
evidence
was
that
generating
the
individual
names
and
addresses
would
be
very
laborious,
their
witnesses
so
testified,
very
expensive.
certainly
beyond
any
reasonable
effort
on
the
plaintiff’s
part
and
they
offered
to
furnish
the
names
and
addresses
undertaking
an
unreasonable
effort
only
to
make
the
plaintiff
to
pay
for
individual
notice.
in
other
words,
they
were
trying
to
get
the
key
to
their
own
salvation
by
saying
“well,
we
don’t
care
what
the
effort.
we’ll
generate
these
names
and
addresses.”
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
the
case.
so
that
if
you
simply
take
the
second
part
of
the
rule,
i
submit
that
it
really
doesn’t
require
individual
notice
in
this
case,
and
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
is
exactly
the
kind
of
notice
that
the
district
court
ordered.
and
this
isn’t
a
case
like
mullane
or
schroeder,
where
individual
notice
was
really
important
at
that
stage
of
the
case
because
persons
were
about
to
be
deprived
of
their
property
interests.
here
in
eisen,
what’s
involved
at
this
point
is
the
effort
to
create
the
common
fund,
and
later
when
the
fund
is
created,
notice
will
go
out
to
everyone
who
can
be
individually
identified,
because
then
they’ll
have
mistaken
what
is
done
with
the
distribution
of
the
fund.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
but
that
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
but
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
but
you
still
have
to
look
at
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
emeritus
when
it
talks
in
terms
of
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances.
the
advisory
committee
notes
that
in
many
cases
the
interests
of
the
class
members
to
whom
that
notice
would
be
directed,
the
more
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
but
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
their
interests,
because
their
claims
are
so
small
and
more
theoretic
than
practical
anyway,
they
would
not
bring
in
individual
suits
anymore
than
eisen
could
bring
an
individual
suit
without
the
class.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
that’s
only
one
possibility
your
honor,
that
may
or
may
not
be
adopted
depending
upon
the
circumstances
at
that
stage
of
the
case,
but
certainly
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
they
are
barred,
your
honor.
they
are
barred
unless
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
although
they
are
barred
as
i
think
the
advisory
committee
its
decisions
points
out
it's
something
that
they
could
litigate
subsequently.
in
other
words,
it’s
not
decided
in
the
first
case,
the
res
judicata
effect
of
the
judgment.
that’s
something
that
they
would
have
a
chance,
if
they
wanted
to,
to
litigate
later,
but
the
chances
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
that
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
but
in
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
it’s
right,
but
res
judicata
depends
on
the
hansberry
and
lee,
and
such
cases
as
that
on
adequacy
of
representation.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
don’t
know
whether
the
rule
was
necessary.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
decision
of
this
court
that
the
defendants
point
to,
to
the
effect
that
in
what
we’ve
previously
known
as
spurious
class
actions,
if
you
had
adequacy
of
representation,
but
not
complete
notice
that
that
wasn’t
res
judicata,
perhaps
it
was,
perhaps
it
should
be
the
ben-hur
case
where
everyone’s
interests
are
really
common
just
as
they
are
when
they
are
going
after
a
common
fund.
now,
in
the
cost
of
notice,
i
think
i’ve
covered
that
to
some
extent
already,
the
court
is
said
you
have
to
direct
notice.
if
the
parties
have
to
direct
notice,
i
submit
that
that
can
be
decided
on
an
equitable
basis,
and
here,
even
without
the
evidentiary
hearing,
the
court
of
appeals,
i
mean,
the
district
court
would’ve
been
justified
in
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
these
sec’s
own
special
study
had
found
that
the
defendant
exchange
had
breached
its
duty
these
odd-lot
investors.
and
what
is
really
so
wrong
about
making
the
exchange,
which
is
supposed
to
protect
investors,
and
which
didn’t,
pay
for
notifying
them
that
they
have
an
opportunity
to
get
some
kind
of
recourse,
if
that
is
the
only
recourse
that
they
have.
and
perhaps,
the
whole
question
of
individual
notice,
mr.
justice
white,
could
be
eliminated
as
a
problem
if
you
would
hold
that
the
defendants
can
be
made
for
the
entire
individual
notice
here.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
yes.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
under
rule
54
(d),
i
think
equitable
principles
could
be
applied.
it
depends
on
the
equities
of
this
situation.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
not
even
probably.
there’s
a
case
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
i
say,
well
there
is
no
bond
provision
for
any
plaintiff
under
the
anti
trust
law.
suppose
you’re
put
out
of
business
by
an
antitrust
violator,
and
he’s
taken
away
your
opportunity
to
make
any
money
and
you
just
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
say
your
[attempt
to
laughter]
own
transcripts,
but
you
certainly
don’t
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
defendant’s
costs,
taxable
costs,
that
they
incur
in
defending
the
suit.
does
it
mean
that
if
you’re
put
out
of
business,
but
for
some
reason
you
lose
your
antitrust
suit,
you
have
to
put
up
a
bond?
or
in
the
contrary
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
that’s
something
that
might
depend
on
the
jury.
i
don’t
think
you
can
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
there’s
a
case
where
a
plaintiff
established
that
the
defendant
had
violated
the
robinson-patman
act,
but
the
jury
found
he
hadn’t
been
damaged,
and
the
judgment
was
entered
for
the
defendants,
but
the
court
still
taxed
the
cost
to
the
defendants
because
they
had
violated
the
law.
and
i
think
in
principle
and
in
equity,
it’s
no
different
from
what
the
special
study
of
the
sec
shows
here,
that
is
the
exchange
breached
its
duty
to
investors
and
perhaps
this
cost
should
be
put
on
the
exchange
simply
on
that
basis
alone
and
never
made
a
taxable
cost.
why
shouldn’t
the
exchange
pay
for
it?
they
are
supposed
to
protect
investors
and
the
sec
has
found
that
they
didn’t
and
perhaps
it
won’t
be
held
to
be
an
antitrust
violation
even
then
i
say,
the
costs
are
equitably
to
be
imposed
on
the
defendants
in
this
case.
i
will
reserve
some
time
for
reply
if
i
may?
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
respect
to
the
formula
at
page
a212
of
the
appendix,
the
district
court
opinion
states
“the
defendants
consistently
have
stressed
the
number
of
variations
and
the
type
of
odd-lot
transactions,
implying
that
this
would
necessitate
a
separate
calculation
of
damage
for
each
individual
transaction.”
although
originally
influenced
by
this
argument
in
light
of
the
availability
of
such
information
and
records
discussed
above,
i
now
reject
it.
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
pointed
out
moreover,
the
defendants
make
the
same
charge
to
all
buyers
and
sellers
no
matter
what
the
type
of
transaction.
in
other
words,
the
defendants
lived
by
a
formula
so
it’s
more
than
likely
that
the
damages
can
be
assessed
by
a
formula.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
all
that
we’re
suggesting
is
that
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
--
that
in
light
of
the
comments
of
judge
tyler,
it’s
more
than
likely
that
this
case
will
be
manageable
pursuant
to
a
formula.
and
if
you
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
he
hasn’t
devised
one,
because
we
have
to
go
through
the
trial.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
but
we
have
to
go
through
the
trial
on
the
question
of
damages
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
overcharge
was.
what
we’re
saying
is,
it
would
be
applied
across
the
board
to
every
single
transaction
under
judge
tyler’s
reasoning.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
and
if
it
isn’t
clear
that’s
certainly
something
that
should
be
made
clear
by
the
district
court
and
it
could
be
made
clear.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
i
think
the
fact
that
he
has
found
that
common
question
predominate,
and
this
is
one
of
the
common
questions
that
he
thought
predominated,
and
the
basis
that
he’s
used
for
it
is
sufficient
on
which
to
proceed
at
this
time.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
this
was
before
the
mini-hearing.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
on
the
basis
of
the
sec
special
study
where
they
pointed
out
that
exactly
the
same
rates
have
been
charged.
that
all
the
members
of
the
class
including
those
who
would
otherwise
prefer
to
abide
by
the
status
quo
will
be
helped
if
the
rates
are
found
to
be
excessive.
if
the
rates
are
found
to
be
excessive,
they’ll
be
found
to
be
excessive
for
everyone
who
is
subjected
to
them
in
the
past,
and
hopefully
if
we
are
right
that
the
ebasco
(ph)
study
means
there’s
still
some
cushion
or
fat
in
the
rates
for
those
in
the
future.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
now,
secondly
mr.
jackson
said
that
we
change
the
substantive
law
by
seeking
judgment
for
the
class
as
a
whole.
well,
judgments
for
class
as
a
whole
are
routinely
entered
in
securities
act
cases.
in
the
gerstle
against
gamble-skogmo
case,
there
was
a
judgment
for
the
whole
class
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit.
the
question
then
is,
after
the
judgment
has
been
entered,
who
can
make
claims
about
against
the
fund
and
what
should
be
done
with
any
residue?
that
is
something
for
later
determination
as
i
argued
before.
on
the
question
of
practicability
governing
the
entire
notice
rule,
our
reply
brief
refers
to
an
article
by
professor
kathleen
and
other
authorities
who
support
this
kind
of
notice
in
this
kind
of
case.
in
fact,
there
is
no
commentary
on
the
notice
ordered
by
judge
tyler,
no
scholarly
commentary
that
i
know
of,
which
says
that
the
notice
is
insufficient.
indeed,
judge
medina
said
that
under
certain
circumstances,
a
publication
may
amount
to
the
best
notice
practicable,
particularly
where
requirement
of
a
different
form
of
notice
would
prevent
potentially
meritorious
claims
from
being
litigated.
that’s
the
case
here.
i
think
it’s
particularly
ironic
that
the
defendants
say
they
can
get
the
names
and
addresses
from
the
tapes,
but
can’t
get
anything
else.
and
the
cost
that
they’re
volunteering
to
undertake
of
generating
the
names
and
addresses
from
the
tapes
is
more,
according
to
their
witnesses,
than
the
cost
that
they
would
have
to
pay
if
they
went
in
accordance
with
judge
tyler’s
notice.
in
other
words,
they’re
willing
to
pay
more
so
that
we
can
be
put
out
of
court.
now,
i
do
think
that
public
respect
for
the
law
must
be
considered,
and
just
because
these
are
small
claimants
as
distinguished
for
example
from
the
three
million
shareholders
of
at&t,
who
undoubtedly
if
they
were
a
proxy
violation
affecting
them,
could
come
into
court
and
presumably
use
the
class
action
devise
to
protect
their
interests.
i
think
that
the
small
claimant’s
interests
have
to
be
satisfied
just
like
those
of
the
large
claimants,
or
the
claims
of
large
individual
corporations
that
can
afford
to
come
in
and
sue
for
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
i
refer
by
analogy
to
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said
in
u.s.
versus
students
challenging
regulatory
agency
procedures
that
to
deny
standing,
which
is
the
analogy
i
draw
here,
would
mean
that
the
most
injurious
and
widespread
governmental
actions
could
be
questioned
by
nobody,
we
cannot
accept
that
conclusion.
similarly
here,
we
can’t
accept
the
conclusion
that
the
more
widespread
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
or
securities
laws,
and
the
smaller
the
resources
of
the
victims,
the
less
effective
the
remedy.
i
think
the
defendants
would
like
to
be
able
to
limit
all
classes
to
the
19th
century
class
approved
by
this
court
in
smith
against
swormstedt,
which
was
described
by
the
court
as
consisting
of
traveling
of
the
worn-out
methodist
preachers,
but
in
this
day
of
mass
frauds
where
we
have
the
national
student
marketing
case,
and
the
equity
funding
case,
and
the
penn
central
case,
if
you
affirm
the
second
circuit
here,
you
may
very
well
put
tremendous
obstacles
in
the
ways
of
cases
like
that.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think,
your
honor,
in
light
of
your
decision
in
the
utah
case
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
--
we
have
two
years
left.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
was
in
and
out
of
class
status
here,
and
i
think
we
can
tackle
of
the
different
periods
of
time,
we
have
about
two
years
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
so.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
to
review
its
decision
dismissing
the
action
as
a
class
action.
the
grant
of
certiorari
requested
the
parties
to
brief
and
to
argue
in
addition
to
the
questions
presented,
a
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
other
questions,
include
the
manageability
of
the
large
class
action,
who
must
be
given
notice,
who
should
pay
for
the
notice
and
the
scope
of
discretion
of
the
district
court.
turning
first
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals,
jurisdiction
was
asserted
on
two
grounds.
first
of
all,
the
court
in
1968
in
reversing
the
district
court
said
that
it
retained
jurisdiction
and
secondly,
the
defendants
say
that
it
has
jurisdiction
anyway
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
originally,
jurisdiction
was
assumed
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
what
became
known
as
the
“"death
knell"”
doctrine
when
the
class
action
in
the
first
instance
was
dismissed
by
judge
tyler
in
the
district
court,
and
on
the
plaintiff’s
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
to
dismiss
the
class
action
would
in
effect
bring
it
to
an
end,
and
the
class
would
never
get
any
chance
of
review.
now,
if
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
was
incorrectly
decided,
later
when
the
case
was
decided
on
the
merits
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
what
became
known
as
eisen
ii,
when
it
said
“we
retain
jurisdiction,”
it
would
obviously
have
had
no
jurisdiction
to
retain,
and
the
defendants
concede
that.
we
however,
adhere
to
our
view
originally
expressed
in
our
position
to
their
petition
for
certiorari
before
this
court
and
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
came
up
for
review,
and
that
petition
was
denied,
that
it
was
soundly
decided
by
the
second
circuit.
now
it
has
been
considerably
eroded
since
then.
for
example,
the
third
circuit
in
hackett
against
general
host
corporation,
rejected
it
entirely.
but
what
happened
in
hackett
i
think
shows
how
wise
the
second
circuit
was
in
adopting
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
because
after
hackett
refused
to
hear
the
appeal
in
that
consumer
antitrust
case
brought
by
a
and
on
behalf
of
purchasers
of
bread
following
a
conviction
for
price
fixing
in
the
philadelphia
area.
the
case
was
dropped
by
the
plaintiff,
because
it
couldn’t
proceed
without
having
a
class
action
to
support
it
and
consequently,
the
question
of
the
class
never
got
to
be
reviewed.
our
submission
is
different.
we
submit
that
while
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
reversing
the
district
court,
when
the
district
court
dismissed
the
class
action,
that
it
retained
jurisdiction,
what
it
actually
did
was
to
relinquish
jurisdiction
because
it
reversed.
and
this
is
unlike
cases
where
court
of
appeals
may
remand
the
record
for
further
findings
because
the
record
before
it
is
insufficient
to
enable
it
to
render
a
decision
and
meanwhile,
no
decision
is
rendered.
here,
a
decision
was
rendered
so
that
the
court
said
it
retained
jurisdiction,
but
it
really
didn’t.
in
fact,
the
defendants
were
so
confused
about
their
role
that
when
they
came
up
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
final
time,
this
time
trying
to
reverse
the
district
court,
because
the
district
court
had
sustained
the
class
action
in
every
respect,
they
didn’t
know
who
they
were,
and
they
designated
themselves
as
appellees
even
though
they
have
lost.
so
there
is
a
complete
paradox
and
anomaly,
and
the
court
of
appeals
having
rendered
this
decision
saying
in
fact
that
it
retained
it.
turning
to
the
collateral
order
doctrine
under
cohen,
that
has
no
application
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
class
action
determination
is,
in
the
language
of
cohen,
but
a
step
toward
the
final
judgment
in
which
it
will
merge.
rule
23
(c)
prescribes
that
judgment
will
be
entered
for/or
against
the
class,
as
the
court
recently
noted
in
its
opinion
in
american
pipe
against
the
state
of
utah.
and
it
is
a
step
which
has
to
be
taken
in
every
class
action,
because
under
rule
23
(c)
1,
the
court
is
required
as
soon
as
practicable
after
the
class
action
is
brought
to
make
the
class
action
determination.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
it’s
unreviewable
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
reached
out
to
decide
all
sorts
of
questions
that
were
only
tentatively
decided
by
the
district
court
that
were
not
ripe
for
decision,
and
that
should
have
awaited
a
complete
record
in
the
district
court
in
the
same
way
as
many
decisions
of
the
district
court
are
not
reviewable
in
initial
stages
of
the
case.
and
in
any
event,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
in
his
concurrence
in
the
state
of
utah
case,
rule
23
specifically
provides
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
sustaining
the
class,
or
even
denying
the
class
maybe
altered
or
amended
prior
to
decision
on
the
merits,
and
judge
tyler
in
fact
said
in
his
opinion
on
which
he
was
reversed
here
that
the
response
to
the
kind
of
notice
that
he
had
ordered
might
prompt
him
to
change
his
mind
and
disallow
the
class,
so
that
this
is
the
kind
of
order
that
cohen
certainly
doesn’t
contemplate
will
be
reviewed
now,
because
it
might
be
changed.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
yes,
your
honor.
cohen
and
gillespie,
they
held
there
that
this
was
in
effect
something
that
would
irreparably
harm
the
class,
because
this
was
the
only
way
the
class
could
get
review.
it’s
like
the
case
where
an
attachment
is
released
and
unless
there’s
immediate
review,
the
object
of
the
attachment
maybe
gone.
but
here,
the
congress
is
that
the
defendant's
preserve
their
right
to
review,
which
the
plaintiff
didn’t
have
in
cohen,
and
wouldn’t
have
had
if
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
hadn’t
been
applied.
the
defendants
at
the
end
of
this
case,
when
judgment
is
entered
will
have
the
right
to
review
on
all
of
these
questions,
and
at
that
point
it
could
very
well
be
that
judge
tyler
will
have
modified
his
order,
will
have
reduced
the
class,
might
have
eliminated
the
class
entirely,
changed
it
in
many
possible
ways.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
that’s
no
different,
your
honor,
from
discovery
orders.
for
example,
in
twa
against
hughes.
the
defendant
there
was
ordered
to
comply
with
discovery
which
the
defendant
said
would
cost
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
are
filed
in
this
court
$5
million,
but
nevertheless,
the
discovery
order,
as
all
discovery
orders
are
held
to
be,
was
held
to
be
interlocutory
and
not
appealable,
and
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
because
the
rule
doesn’t
impose
the
burden
of
costs
on
the
plaintiff.
it
says
the
court
shall
direct
notice
to
the
class,
and
so
it
obviously,
unless
the
court
is
the
one
that
is
supposed
to
pay
for
notice
under
that
specific
language.
it
obviously
gives
the
court
the
power
to
decide
who
should
pay
for
the
notice.
and
here,
just
like
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
may
be
subjected
to
the
cost
on
preparing
to
try
an
antitrust
case
have
to
pay
for
the
transcript,
have
to
pay
for
discovery,
but
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
plaintiff
isn’t
required
and
cannot
be
required
to
put
up
any
security
for
those
costs.
the
defendant
there
as
the
defendant
here
has
to
look
to
whatever
judgment
is
entered
at
the
end
of
the
case
in
its
favor
if
such
a
judgment
is
entered,
and
collecting
that
judgment
if
it
gets
a
judgment
for
costs
that
should
not
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
some
instances
for
example,
where
a
master
is
appointed
and
the
parties
are
required
to
advance
the
expenses
of
the
master
before
the
end
of
the
case,
and
there
may
be
a
division
i
think
under
the
equity
powers,
under
rule
54
(b)
to
allocate
those
costs.
but
in
any
event,
this
is
no
different
from
the
discovery
cases
from
the
standpoint
of
finality
on
appeal
because
you
may
recall
that
hickman
versus
taylor
came
before
this
court,
because
mr.
fortenbaugh,
the
philadelphia
lawyer
who
was
asserting
the
privilege
against
producing
his
work
products
papers
there,
had
to
undergo
a
citation
for
contempt
before
he
could
get
review.
we
are
not
at
this
stage
in
this
case.
the
defendants
have
not
said
whether
they
will
comply
with
the
order
or
they
won’t
comply
with
the
order
and
certainly,
this
is
no
different
from
the
discovery
cases.
for
example,
united
states
versus
ibm
which
is
before
you
on
petition
for
certiorari.
until
the
defendants
have
taken
some
irrevocable
step
with
respect
to
the
order
of
the
district
court.
suppose
they
say
“we
won’t
put
up
the
costs?”
well,
there
are
all
sorts
of
alternatives.
they
might
be
held
in
contempt,
in
which
case
depending
i
suppose
on
whether
it’s
civil
or
criminal
contempt
under
the
ibm
case,
they
might
have
a
right
to
review.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
might
say,
“well,
if
they
won’t
put
up
the
costs,
we
are
going
to
say
that
this
would
have
the
effect
of
a
rule
23
class
action
even
without
notice
to
the
class
for
certain
results,
for
example,
for
binding
the
defendants
as
against
the
prospect
of
one
way
intervention,
and
so
on.”
so
that
this
is
no
different
certainly
from
the
discovery
cases
even
if
it
were
thought
to
be
slightly
different
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant’s
advancing
costs
at
this
point,
from
the
standpoint
of
finality.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
doubt
it
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
move
us
back
to
the
district
court
and
under
his
powers
expressly
given
under
rule
23,
judge
tyler
hopefully
would
then
say
that
he
was
wrong
the
first
time,
he
was
right
the
second
time
and
would
reinstate
his
second
decision
upholding
the
class.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
to
another
distinction
in
cohen
that
involved
the
general
applicability
of
a
statute,
and
the
question
in
cohen
as
phrased
by
another
panel
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
weight
watchers
case
was
whether
a
decision
will
settle
a
point
once
for
all
as
it
did
in
cohen,
or
will
open
the
way
to
a
flood
of
appeals
concerning
the
propriety
of
a
district
court’s
ruling
on
the
facts
of
a
particular
suit.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
held
that
in
some
cases,
costs
can
be
imposed
on
the
defendants.
cases
where
they
may
have
a
duty,
for
example,
a
corporation’s
duty
to
its
stockholders,
but
here,
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
in
some
cases,
the
district
court
may
impose
cost
in
others
and
particularly
in
this
case,
they
said
it’s
inappropriate.
so
what
they
are
really
doing
is
interfering
with
the
district
court’s
discretion
depending
on
how
they
view
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
furthermore,
turning
really,
not
to
the
question
of
appealability,
but
advancing
somewhat
to
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
putting
the
cost
on
the
defense,
here
the
district
court
found
in
these
findings
were
not
upset
by
the
court
of
appeals,
because
the
court
simply
said
the
district
court
didn’t
have
jurisdiction
to
make
them,
that
the
new
york
stock
exchange
had
violated
its
duty
under
the
exchange
act
to
protect
the
odd-lot
investors
who
are
the
class
in
this
case.
and
the
violation
of
that
duty,
in
which
it
was
aided
and
abetted
by
the
other
defendants,
certainly
is
no
different
from
the
kind
of
duty
were
no
less
in
scope
than
the
duty
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
could
be
the
basis
for
putting
costs
on
the
defendants
in
another
kind
of
case.
so
for
that
reason,
cohen
doesn’t
apply
because
this
is
really
a
decision
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
many
district
courts
have
routinely
since
rule
23
was
amended,
allocated
the
costs
between
the
parties
without
any
thought
that
they
were
doing
anything
wrong,
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
says
in
some
cases
they
should
be
able
to
do
that.
so
that
i
submit
that
a
general
rule
which
this
court
would
be
asked
to
apply,
that
in
no
case
can
costs
be
allocated,
should
not
be
adopted,
and
since
the
question
of
a
general
rule
isn’t
involved,
the
defendants
had
no
right
of
appeal.
now,
turning
to
the
issue
of
manageability
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
in
the
fifth
circuit
it’s
recognized.
i
believe
there
are
number
of
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
it’s
been
recognized,
but
i
think
that
the
two
circuits
which
have
definitely
ruled
on
it
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
--
for
and
against
on
are
the
second
and
the
third.
on
the
issue
of
manageability,
it’s
not
an
issue
at
all
in
class
actions
maintained
under
23
(b)
102,
which
would
be
for
example,
actions
for
an
accounting,
for
a
trust
fund,
or
here
an
action
for
injunctive
relief.
and
the
second
circuit,
just
summarily,
in
its
first
decision
where
it
reversed
dismissal
of
the
class
action
said
this
can’t
be
a
(b)
(2)
action
because
the
advisory
committee
note
says
that
that
doesn’t
apply
to
situations
exclusively
or
predominantly
for
the
recovery
of
damages.
now,
this
case
isn’t
exclusively
or
predominantly
for
the
recovery
of
damages.
this
case
seeks
and
has
sought
from
the
very
first
in
the
complaint
requests,
very
substantial
injunctive
relief.
for
example,
the
sec
special
study
of
the
odd-lot
markets
which
was
the
basis
really
for
this
case,
found
that
an
engineering
firm
ebasco
had
concluded
in
1955
that
very
large
cost
savings
could
be
put
into
effect
if
the
odd-lot
defendants
automated
their
operations.
and
judge
tyler
found
in
july
of
1972
that
as
of
that
date,
those
recommendations
have
not
only
not
been
implemented,
they
hadn’t
even
been
considered,
so
there
is
still
a
substantial
need
for
injunctive
relief
here
to
reduce
the
costs
of
the
odd-lot
defendants,
because
as
the
court
found,
reduction
of
those
costs
would
necessarily
have
a
beneficial
result
for
the
class,
because
it
would
mean
that
the
odd-lot
differential,
which
is
the
basis
of
this
case,
a
charge
that
it
was
inflated
and
fixed
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
would
necessarily
be
affected
and
reduced.
yet
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
out
the
(b)
(2)
action
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
manageability
enters
into
the
rule
only
under
(b)
(3)
actions
those
that
are
what
were
formerly
known
as
spurious
class
actions,
but
since
your
decision
in
the
utah
case
are
known
as
truly
representative
suits
like
all
of
the
others.
and
manageability
in
(b)
(3)
actions
under
the
language
of
the
rule
is
only
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
deciding
whether
the
class
action
is
superior
to
other
available
methods
for
the
fair
and
efficient
adjudication
of
the
controversy.
and
here,
the
court
of
appeals
said
both
in
the
"death
knell"
opinion
and
in
the
second
opinion
that
the
class
action
is
the
only
feasible
method
for
adjudicating
this
controversy,
because
the
individual
class
members,
like
eisen
have
such
small
states
that
they’re
not
going
to
come
forward
with
individual
suits.
and
yet,
having
held
twice
that
this
is
the
only
feasible
method,
and
the
rule
saying
that
manageability
is
only
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
whether
the
class
action
is
superior
to
other
available
methods,
the
court
of
appeals
dismisses
it
as
the
class
action.
aside
from
the
language
of
the
rule
itself,
however,
the
difficulties
of
management
which
the
court
of
appeals
perceived
in
this
action
are
just
not
so.
first
of
all,
it
didn’t
even
consider
what
the
rule
specifically
provides
and
that
is
that
you
can
have
a
class
action
on
the
common
question
of
liability.
that
part
of
the
class
action
is
certainly
sound.
but
here,
the
district
court
also
found
that
gross
damages
can
be
determined
that
on
the
basis
of
a
common
formula,
and
estimated
for
the
entire
class.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
odd-lot
defendants
know
exactly
what
they
charged
to
the
class
as
a
whole,
because
the
charge
was
their
income,
and
if
the
district
court
is
right
that
the
formula
can
be
adopted,
then
we
know
what
part
of
that
total
charge,
that
aggregate
charge
was
an
over
charge.
now,
certainly,
as
to
the
two
million
and
the
quarter
class
members
whose
individual
transactions,
the
defendant
stipulated
are
recorded
on
computer
tapes
and
can
be
derived
from
those
computer
tapes.
constituting
56%
of
the
transactions
of
the
class
as
a
whole,
what
is
the
difficulty
in
managing
that
if
you
have
a
formula
that
you
can
apply
across
the
board?
this
is
no
different
from
the
utility
cases
where
refunds
are
routinely
ordered
when
some
rate
is
found
to
have
been
too
high.
and
in
fact,
in
the
panhandle
eastern
pipeline
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
refunds
were
made
to
over
a
million
ultimate
consumers
with
reasonable
promptness
and
without
serious
controversy
under
the
supervision
of
a
master.
similarly
in
the
illinois
bell
telephone
case
in
the
days
when
people
have
to
copy
records
like
bob
crotchet
sitting
on
a
stool,
and
before
the
days
of
the
computer,
refunds
were
made
of
$17
million
to
over
a
million
people
entitled
to
the
refunds.
so
if
you
have
a
formula,
there’s
really
no
great
problem
in
managing,
especially
with
the
assistance
of
data
processing,
and
from
personal
experience
i
know
that
these
burdens
do
not
fall
necessarily
on
the
court,
they
are
assumed
by
counsel,
by
accountants,
and
by
data
processing
firms.
and
here,
you
have
two
and
a
quarter
million
class
members
who
stand
to
receive
and
recover
a
tangible
amount
without
undue
difficulties
of
management.
but
they
have
been
put
out
of
court,
because
the
court
of
appeals
erroneously
concluded
and
held
that
judge
tyler
had
said
“that
the
only
way
that
this
class
could
be
managed
would
be
by
the
so-called
fluid
recovery.”
that
is
a
future
reduction
of
the
odd-lot
differential.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
comes
up
in
two
contexts,
first
in
a
settlement
or
after
final
judgment.
now,
in
a
settlement
context
they
are
usually
compensated
out
of
the
fund.
if
it
comes
up
after
the
final
judgment,
then
the
defendants
under
such
decisions
of
this
court
as
mills
against
the
electric
auto-lite
company
are
liable
for
the
costs.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right.
that
only
comes
up
at
the
time
of
distribution,
which
is
after
settlement
or
judgment.
now,
it’s
true
that
the
plaintiff’s
counsel
suggested
in
the
district
court
that
if
six
million
class
members
have
to
go
through
that
ancient
records,
and
he
said
“in
that
narrow
sense,
it
would
be
impracticable.”
so
he
suggested
what
became
known
as
the
fluid
class
recovery
that
is
equitable
relief,
fashioning
a
remedy
for
future
reduction
of
the
odd-lot
differential,
and
that
would
benefit
certainly
odd-lot
investors
as
whole
and
those
who
overlapped
the
class
who
would
pay
the
overcharge
during
the
period
in
the
suit.
the
district
court
didn’t
adopt
that
saying
only
it
merited
consideration
that
individual
claims
could
be
satisfied
to
the
extent
filed,
that
the
fluid
class
recovery
might
then
be
appropriate
for
distribution
of
the
unclaimed
remainders.
and
if
you
have
the
formula
kind
of
distribution
for
those
whose
identities
are
on
tape,
then
you
may
even
be
able
to
cut
out
a
large
part
of
the
claims
procedure.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
i
think
there
are
many
alternatives
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
defendants
could
say
it
should
go
back
to
them,
and
they
will
have
the
opportunity
to
argue
that
after
judgment
is
entered
as
the
rule
contemplates
for
the
total
amount
of
damages
for
the
class
as
a
whole.
secondly,
it
could
be
applied
to
reduce
the
odd-lot
differential
in
the
future.
it
could
be
done
under
the
general
equity
powers
of
the
court,
which
it
certainly
has
under
case
against
borak
to
fashion
any
remedy
to
make
the
securities
act
effective.
and
that’s
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
done
in
the
bebchick
case.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
wasn’t
a
class
action,
but
you
have
class
actions
where
the
same
approach
was
taken.
the
metro
homes
case
in
michigan
was
a
class
action
where
there
had
been
an
illegal
exaction
of
a
tax
than
held
to
be
unlawful,
and
there
the
court
held
that
the
taxing
authority
had
to
pay
over
the
entire
amount
and
couldn’t
get
back
any
part
of
the
amount
illegally
collected,
even
though
individuals
didn’t
come
forward
to
consume
the
entire
amount.
so
that
what
i’m
saying
is
that
although
bebchick
was
a
different
case,
it
provides
part
of
the
substantive
law,
the
equitable
principles
on
which
the
court
can
rely
in
fashioning
a
remedy
whether
the
action
is
a
class
action
or
not
a
class
action.
it
really
makes
no
difference
almost
mr.
justice
powell
to
make
another
answer
to
your
question.
suppose
notice
goes
out
to
the
two
million
and
then
there
is
a
judgment
liability
and
the
fund
is
created,
they
can
then
be
told
you
have
a
refund
due
to
you,
and
the
same
notice
can
be
published
for
those
who
can’t
be
identified,
assuming
that
they
will
read
the
notice.
and
if
you
like,
you
can
assign
your
claim
for
the
benefit
of
future
odd-lot
investors.
that’s
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
approved
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
pfizer
case.
so
there
are
all
sorts
of
possibilities,
but
certainly
at
this
point,
we
don’t
have
to
go
into
them,
because
that
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
people
with
small
claims
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
just
one
of
the
possibilities
to
be
considered
and
i
have
had
experience
in
class
actions
where
people
would
claim
of
as
much
as
$10.00
in
a
class
where
some
people
had
claims
of
thousands
of
dollars.
the
plumbing
fixtures
antitrust
case
pursued
their
claims
for
the
$10.00
just
as
diligently
as
those
with
the
bigger
claims.
it
meant
a
lot
to
them.
just
because
these
claims
are
small,
doesn’t
mean
that
it
doesn’t
mean
a
lot
to
these
investors.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
defendants
have
taken
full
page
ad
saying
they’re
addressed
to
the
odd-lot
investors
as
to
the
little
guys.
these
are
the
little
guys
that
people
who
do
not
have
by
and
large
enough
money
to
invest
very
much
and
so
these
small
amounts
do
mean
a
lot
to
them.
but
in
any
event,
that
was
all
tentative
and
not
necessarily
to
be
decided,
and
certainly
not
to
be
ruled
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
sort
of
advisory
opinion
basis.
now,
turning
to
individual
notice,
it’s
not
required
in
(b)
(2)
actions
for
an
injunction
and
under
the
decisions
like
hansberry
and
lee,
and
ben-hur
against
cauble,
adequacy
of
representation
is
the
hallmark
of
due
process
and
class
actions,
not
individual
notice.
for
example,
those
precluded
by
the
judgment
in
ben-hur
never
had
notice
of
the
prior
class
action
which
precluded
them.
under
(b)
(2),
individual
notice
is
not
required
by
the
rule,
and
the
defendants
concede
it.
now,
under
23
(c),
the
court
is
directed
direct
the
members
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances
including
individual
notice
to
all
members
who
can
be
identified
through
reasonable
effort.
it
doesn’t
mandate
individual
notice
where
it’s
not
practicable
or
where
identification
entails
more
than
a
reasonable
effort.
and
here,
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
held
that
the
claims
of
the
silent
members
of
the
class
are
more
theoretic
than
real,
they
are
not
going
to
want
to
have
an
opportunity
to
opt
out
to
conduct
their
own
litigation.
they’re
going
to
rely
on
the
class
and
the
results
of
the
class
so
that
the
kind
of
notice
ordered
by
the
district
court
here
certainly
conforms
to
the
language
of
the
rule
which
is
a
rule
of
reason,
that
it’s
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances,
because
to
have
a
requirement
of
any
other
kind
notice
and
the
case
where
the
class
consists
of
small
claimants
would
mean
that
the
class
action
rule
could
never
be
used
if
you
had
a
stringent
notice
requirement
to
protect
their
interests.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
(b)
(3)
action
where
that
kind
of
notice
required
a
(b)
(3)
actions
have
to
be
given.
now
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
it
could
be
looked
as
a
(b)
(2)
action
and
there
are
a
number
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
says
it
wasn’t.
i
say
it
was.
i
say
it
was
(b)
(2)
and
(b)
(3)
and
where
its
hybrid
that
exposed
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
(b)
(1)
where
it’s
hybrid.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
said
no.
no
(b)
(1)
either.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
there
are
a
number
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
that
say
that
if
it
can
be
viewed
as
(b)
(1)
or
(b)
(2),
you
view
it
as
(b)
(1)
or
(b)
(2)
even
if
it's
also
a
(b)
(3).
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
isn’t
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
if
you
must
look
at
it
as
a
(b)
(3)
action
then
the
question
is
what’s
reasonable
notice
within
the
intendment
of
the
rule,
and
what
are
the
interests
to
be
served
by
notice.
now
one
of
the
interests
to
be
served
by
individual
notice
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
it
says
the
court
shall
direct
to
the
members
of
the
class
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances.
and
in
mullane,
this
case
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
it
says
including
individual
notice
to
all
members
who
can
be
identified
through
a
reasonable
effort.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
but,
first
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
yes,
whatever
the
effort
and
whatever
the
circumstances.
first
of
all,
we
say
the
best
notice
of
practicable
under
the
circumstances
qualifies
the
rest
of
the
rule,
but
on
the
record
here,
even
if
it
doesn’t,
the
defendant’s
evidence
was
that
generating
the
individual
names
and
addresses
would
be
very
laborious,
their
witnesses
so
testified,
very
expensive.
certainly
beyond
any
reasonable
effort
on
the
plaintiff’s
part
and
they
offered
to
furnish
the
names
and
addresses
undertaking
an
unreasonable
effort
only
to
make
the
plaintiff
to
pay
for
individual
notice.
in
other
words,
they
were
trying
to
get
the
key
to
their
own
salvation
by
saying
“well,
we
don’t
care
what
the
effort.
we’ll
generate
these
names
and
addresses.”
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
the
case.
so
that
if
you
simply
take
the
second
part
of
the
rule,
i
submit
that
it
really
doesn’t
require
individual
notice
in
this
case,
and
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
is
exactly
the
kind
of
notice
that
the
district
court
ordered.
and
this
isn’t
a
case
like
mullane
or
schroeder,
where
individual
notice
was
really
important
at
that
stage
of
the
case
because
persons
were
about
to
be
deprived
of
their
property
interests.
here
in
eisen,
what’s
involved
at
this
point
is
the
effort
to
create
the
common
fund,
and
later
when
the
fund
is
created,
notice
will
go
out
to
everyone
who
can
be
individually
identified,
because
then
they’ll
have
mistaken
what
is
done
with
the
distribution
of
the
fund.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
but
that
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
but
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
but
you
still
have
to
look
at
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
emeritus
when
it
talks
in
terms
of
the
best
notice
practicable
under
the
circumstances.
the
advisory
committee
notes
that
in
many
cases
the
interests
of
the
class
members
to
whom
that
notice
would
be
directed,
the
more
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
but
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
their
interests,
because
their
claims
are
so
small
and
more
theoretic
than
practical
anyway,
they
would
not
bring
in
individual
suits
anymore
than
eisen
could
bring
an
individual
suit
without
the
class.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
that’s
only
one
possibility
your
honor,
that
may
or
may
not
be
adopted
depending
upon
the
circumstances
at
that
stage
of
the
case,
but
certainly
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
they
are
barred,
your
honor.
they
are
barred
unless
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
although
they
are
barred
as
i
think
the
advisory
committee
its
decisions
points
out
it's
something
that
they
could
litigate
subsequently.
in
other
words,
it’s
not
decided
in
the
first
case,
the
res
judicata
effect
of
the
judgment.
that’s
something
that
they
would
have
a
chance,
if
they
wanted
to,
to
litigate
later,
but
the
chances
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
that
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
but
in
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
it’s
right,
but
res
judicata
depends
on
the
hansberry
and
lee,
and
such
cases
as
that
on
adequacy
of
representation.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
don’t
know
whether
the
rule
was
necessary.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
decision
of
this
court
that
the
defendants
point
to,
to
the
effect
that
in
what
we’ve
previously
known
as
spurious
class
actions,
if
you
had
adequacy
of
representation,
but
not
complete
notice
that
that
wasn’t
res
judicata,
perhaps
it
was,
perhaps
it
should
be
the
ben-hur
case
where
everyone’s
interests
are
really
common
just
as
they
are
when
they
are
going
after
a
common
fund.
now,
in
the
cost
of
notice,
i
think
i’ve
covered
that
to
some
extent
already,
the
court
is
said
you
have
to
direct
notice.
if
the
parties
have
to
direct
notice,
i
submit
that
that
can
be
decided
on
an
equitable
basis,
and
here,
even
without
the
evidentiary
hearing,
the
court
of
appeals,
i
mean,
the
district
court
would’ve
been
justified
in
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
these
sec’s
own
special
study
had
found
that
the
defendant
exchange
had
breached
its
duty
these
odd-lot
investors.
and
what
is
really
so
wrong
about
making
the
exchange,
which
is
supposed
to
protect
investors,
and
which
didn’t,
pay
for
notifying
them
that
they
have
an
opportunity
to
get
some
kind
of
recourse,
if
that
is
the
only
recourse
that
they
have.
and
perhaps,
the
whole
question
of
individual
notice,
mr.
justice
white,
could
be
eliminated
as
a
problem
if
you
would
hold
that
the
defendants
can
be
made
for
the
entire
individual
notice
here.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
yes.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
under
rule
54
(d),
i
think
equitable
principles
could
be
applied.
it
depends
on
the
equities
of
this
situation.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
not
even
probably.
there’s
a
case
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
i
say,
well
there
is
no
bond
provision
for
any
plaintiff
under
the
anti
trust
law.
suppose
you’re
put
out
of
business
by
an
antitrust
violator,
and
he’s
taken
away
your
opportunity
to
make
any
money
and
you
just
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
say
your
[attempt
to
laughter]
own
transcripts,
but
you
certainly
don’t
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
defendant’s
costs,
taxable
costs,
that
they
incur
in
defending
the
suit.
does
it
mean
that
if
you’re
put
out
of
business,
but
for
some
reason
you
lose
your
antitrust
suit,
you
have
to
put
up
a
bond?
or
in
the
contrary
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
that’s
something
that
might
depend
on
the
jury.
i
don’t
think
you
can
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
there’s
a
case
where
a
plaintiff
established
that
the
defendant
had
violated
the
robinson-patman
act,
but
the
jury
found
he
hadn’t
been
damaged,
and
the
judgment
was
entered
for
the
defendants,
but
the
court
still
taxed
the
cost
to
the
defendants
because
they
had
violated
the
law.
and
i
think
in
principle
and
in
equity,
it’s
no
different
from
what
the
special
study
of
the
sec
shows
here,
that
is
the
exchange
breached
its
duty
to
investors
and
perhaps
this
cost
should
be
put
on
the
exchange
simply
on
that
basis
alone
and
never
made
a
taxable
cost.
why
shouldn’t
the
exchange
pay
for
it?
they
are
supposed
to
protect
investors
and
the
sec
has
found
that
they
didn’t
and
perhaps
it
won’t
be
held
to
be
an
antitrust
violation
even
then
i
say,
the
costs
are
equitably
to
be
imposed
on
the
defendants
in
this
case.
i
will
reserve
some
time
for
reply
if
i
may?
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
respect
to
the
formula
at
page
a212
of
the
appendix,
the
district
court
opinion
states
“the
defendants
consistently
have
stressed
the
number
of
variations
and
the
type
of
odd-lot
transactions,
implying
that
this
would
necessitate
a
separate
calculation
of
damage
for
each
individual
transaction.”
although
originally
influenced
by
this
argument
in
light
of
the
availability
of
such
information
and
records
discussed
above,
i
now
reject
it.
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
pointed
out
moreover,
the
defendants
make
the
same
charge
to
all
buyers
and
sellers
no
matter
what
the
type
of
transaction.
in
other
words,
the
defendants
lived
by
a
formula
so
it’s
more
than
likely
that
the
damages
can
be
assessed
by
a
formula.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
all
that
we’re
suggesting
is
that
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
--
that
in
light
of
the
comments
of
judge
tyler,
it’s
more
than
likely
that
this
case
will
be
manageable
pursuant
to
a
formula.
and
if
you
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
he
hasn’t
devised
one,
because
we
have
to
go
through
the
trial.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
but
we
have
to
go
through
the
trial
on
the
question
of
damages
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
overcharge
was.
what
we’re
saying
is,
it
would
be
applied
across
the
board
to
every
single
transaction
under
judge
tyler’s
reasoning.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
that’s
right,
and
if
it
isn’t
clear
that’s
certainly
something
that
should
be
made
clear
by
the
district
court
and
it
could
be
made
clear.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
well,
i
think
the
fact
that
he
has
found
that
common
question
predominate,
and
this
is
one
of
the
common
questions
that
he
thought
predominated,
and
the
basis
that
he’s
used
for
it
is
sufficient
on
which
to
proceed
at
this
time.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
this
was
before
the
mini-hearing.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
on
the
basis
of
the
sec
special
study
where
they
pointed
out
that
exactly
the
same
rates
have
been
charged.
that
all
the
members
of
the
class
including
those
who
would
otherwise
prefer
to
abide
by
the
status
quo
will
be
helped
if
the
rates
are
found
to
be
excessive.
if
the
rates
are
found
to
be
excessive,
they’ll
be
found
to
be
excessive
for
everyone
who
is
subjected
to
them
in
the
past,
and
hopefully
if
we
are
right
that
the
ebasco
(ph)
study
means
there’s
still
some
cushion
or
fat
in
the
rates
for
those
in
the
future.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
now,
secondly
mr.
jackson
said
that
we
change
the
substantive
law
by
seeking
judgment
for
the
class
as
a
whole.
well,
judgments
for
class
as
a
whole
are
routinely
entered
in
securities
act
cases.
in
the
gerstle
against
gamble-skogmo
case,
there
was
a
judgment
for
the
whole
class
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit.
the
question
then
is,
after
the
judgment
has
been
entered,
who
can
make
claims
about
against
the
fund
and
what
should
be
done
with
any
residue?
that
is
something
for
later
determination
as
i
argued
before.
on
the
question
of
practicability
governing
the
entire
notice
rule,
our
reply
brief
refers
to
an
article
by
professor
kathleen
and
other
authorities
who
support
this
kind
of
notice
in
this
kind
of
case.
in
fact,
there
is
no
commentary
on
the
notice
ordered
by
judge
tyler,
no
scholarly
commentary
that
i
know
of,
which
says
that
the
notice
is
insufficient.
indeed,
judge
medina
said
that
under
certain
circumstances,
a
publication
may
amount
to
the
best
notice
practicable,
particularly
where
requirement
of
a
different
form
of
notice
would
prevent
potentially
meritorious
claims
from
being
litigated.
that’s
the
case
here.
i
think
it’s
particularly
ironic
that
the
defendants
say
they
can
get
the
names
and
addresses
from
the
tapes,
but
can’t
get
anything
else.
and
the
cost
that
they’re
volunteering
to
undertake
of
generating
the
names
and
addresses
from
the
tapes
is
more,
according
to
their
witnesses,
than
the
cost
that
they
would
have
to
pay
if
they
went
in
accordance
with
judge
tyler’s
notice.
in
other
words,
they’re
willing
to
pay
more
so
that
we
can
be
put
out
of
court.
now,
i
do
think
that
public
respect
for
the
law
must
be
considered,
and
just
because
these
are
small
claimants
as
distinguished
for
example
from
the
three
million
shareholders
of
at&t,
who
undoubtedly
if
they
were
a
proxy
violation
affecting
them,
could
come
into
court
and
presumably
use
the
class
action
devise
to
protect
their
interests.
i
think
that
the
small
claimant’s
interests
have
to
be
satisfied
just
like
those
of
the
large
claimants,
or
the
claims
of
large
individual
corporations
that
can
afford
to
come
in
and
sue
for
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
i
refer
by
analogy
to
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said
in
u.s.
versus
students
challenging
regulatory
agency
procedures
that
to
deny
standing,
which
is
the
analogy
i
draw
here,
would
mean
that
the
most
injurious
and
widespread
governmental
actions
could
be
questioned
by
nobody,
we
cannot
accept
that
conclusion.
similarly
here,
we
can’t
accept
the
conclusion
that
the
more
widespread
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
or
securities
laws,
and
the
smaller
the
resources
of
the
victims,
the
less
effective
the
remedy.
i
think
the
defendants
would
like
to
be
able
to
limit
all
classes
to
the
19th
century
class
approved
by
this
court
in
smith
against
swormstedt,
which
was
described
by
the
court
as
consisting
of
traveling
of
the
worn-out
methodist
preachers,
but
in
this
day
of
mass
frauds
where
we
have
the
national
student
marketing
case,
and
the
equity
funding
case,
and
the
penn
central
case,
if
you
affirm
the
second
circuit
here,
you
may
very
well
put
tremendous
obstacles
in
the
ways
of
cases
like
that.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think,
your
honor,
in
light
of
your
decision
in
the
utah
case
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
--
we
have
two
years
left.
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
it
was
in
and
out
of
class
status
here,
and
i
think
we
can
tackle
of
the
different
periods
of
time,
we
have
about
two
years
--
mr.
aaron
m.
fine
i
think
so.
