this
case,
here
on
certiorari
from

a
complex
class
action
suit,
brought
under
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.

with
violations
of
antitrust
and
securities
laws.
the
prospective
class
was
extremely
large,
including
some
six
million
purchasers
and
sellers
of
odd-lot
shares.
more
than
two
million
of
these
could
be
identified
by
name
and
address.
it
was
estimated
that
it
would
cost
$225,000
to
send
notices
to
each
of
these
identified
parties.
the
district
court,
holding
that
individual
notice
was
not
required,
had
proved
a
plan
for
notice
to
be
sent
only
to
a
limited
number
of
the
class
and
for
notice
by
publication
being
directed
to
the
remainder.
this
form
of
notice
would
cause
about
$22,000.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
disapproving
among
other
things,
this
limited
and
incomplete
notice.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
issue.

notice
to
all

the
