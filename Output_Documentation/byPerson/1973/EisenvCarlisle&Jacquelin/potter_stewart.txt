justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fine,
what
if
we
not
only
agreed
with
you,
but
went
further
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
late
date
that
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
as
developed
in
the
second
circuit
is
wholly
inappropriate
and
improper,
that
there
was
no
right
to
appeal
whatsoever
in
eisen
i
from
the
district
court’s
first
disposition
of
this
case,
what
would
be
the
result?
will
this
move
us
all
back
to
square
one,
do
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he’s
right.
but
to
what
you’d
have
then
is,
was
his
first
decision
and
with
an
opportunity
for
you
to
try
to
convince
him
that
he
was
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
having
erased
everything
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
in
the
meantime,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
we
leave
the
question
of
appealability,
i
understand
that
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
was
originally
developed
in
the
second
circuit
and
is
adhered
to
there.
then
it’s
been
given
some
sort
of
halfway
recognition
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
explicitly
disagreed
with
in
the
third
circuit,
and
what
is
the
other
one,
what’s
the
state
of
the
law
on
that
in
the
other
circuits?
justice
potter
stewart
in
theory
and
it
goes
on
and
it
says
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
a
very
specific
purpose
for
a
sit
to
notice
though,
mr.
fine,
isn’t
there?
and
that
is
to
give
the
member
of
the
class
an
opportunity
to
opt
out,
if
it
is
important?
justice
potter
stewart
or
to
hire
his
own
lawyer
if
he
wants
to.
it’s
all
spelled
out
in
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
quite
unlike
(b)
(1)
or
(b)
(2),
(b)
(2)
which
is
primarily
an
injunctive
action.
justice
potter
stewart
make
it
res
judicata.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
after
eisen
i
in
this
court,
didn’t
you
--
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
here,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
which
brought
by
you
or
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
which
was
denied?
justice
potter
stewart
your
client
and
its
counsel
still
the
same
view
that
the
"death
knell"
doctrine
is
an
invalid
doctrine?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
"death
knell"
rule
is
before
us
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
quite
apart
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
retain
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
minute,
mr.
milburn,
he
has
suggested
that
you
now
mail
checks,
before
you
won
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
if
as
or
when
you’ve
lost
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
just
doesn’t
stop,
you
say
with
notice,
it
stops
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
never
stops
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
use
of
the
word
“individual?”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
word
including
individual
notice
to
all
members?
justice
potter
stewart
sorry
mr.
jackson,
now
there
not
some
federal
court
decisions
that
have
said
that
if
a
case
is
in
fact
for
money
damages
and
for
an
injunction
that
notice
need
not
be
given,
where
we
told
that
by
your
brother
at
the
bar
here?
justice
potter
stewart
your
view
would
be
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
forgo
his
money
damage
claim
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
give
the
notice.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
wins.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fine,
throughout
your
brief,
there
was
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
to
have
limitations
may
run
as
to
many
members
of
this
class,
and
that
therefore,
that
affects
the
necessity
of
notice,
i
gather?
i’m
not
sure
i
understood
that.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn’t
utah
take
care
of
that
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
so.
justice
potter
stewart
the
american
pipe
takes
care
of
that
argument?
justice

stewart

you.
