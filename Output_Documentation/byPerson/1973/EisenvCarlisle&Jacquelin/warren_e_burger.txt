chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
what
you’re
saying,
is
there
any
suggestion
or
are
you
suggesting
that
a
circumstance
can
arise
where
the
determination
of
the
district
court
on
the
class
action
is
unreviewable
because
of
the
way
it’s
moved
back
and
forth
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
can

do
about

of
costs
for
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
think

the
same
as

defendant
to
advance
the
costs
through
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

sec
deal
with
this
in
the
general
