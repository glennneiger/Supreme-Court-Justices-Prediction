what
if
there
had
been
an
interruption
in
the
service
in
the
middle
of
a
five-year
period?
if
they
have
five
months,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
couldn’t
you
argue
under
your
theory
that
the
part
of
the
year,
that’s
six
months
or
more
should
be
counted
as
a
full
year?

mr.
patton,
what
if
this
687
(a)
as
you
showed
at
the
top
of
page
three
of
your
brief
where
it
says
at
least
five
years
of
continuous
active
duty.
supposing
that
said
at
least
three
years
of
continuous
active
duty,
and
if
that
--
it
had
gone
through
committee
in
that
language
passed
on
the
floor,
that
language,
we
wouldn’t
listen
to
you
now
i
take
it,
say
that
what
congress
really
meant
was
the
five
years
and
that
they
simply
made
a
mistake
in
putting
in
the
word
three.
