mr.
hanson,
is
this
applicable
to
commissioned
officers
only
or
is
it
to
all
reservist
who
come
within
--?
unknown
speaker
all
these
people
are
officers,
i
know.
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
section
--
if
this
statute
read
the
way
6330
does,
you
wouldn’t
have
a
problem
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well
it
seems
to
me
the
statutes
are
different.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
before
1962
to
1962,
you
wouldn’t
have
much
of
a
case
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well
before
the
statute
was
codified
in
to
its
present
form?
unknown
speaker
but
--
unknown
speaker
but
didn’t
the
reports
indicate
when
they
codified
it
that
they
didn’t
intend
any
substantive
change?
unknown
speaker
but
that’s
the
usual
rule
on
codifications
anyway,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
it
has
a
meaning
for
a
computation.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
house
report?
unknown
speaker
including
this
one?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
they
didn’t
have
any
change
in
the
--
and
another
report
that
purported
to
this,
the
changes
didn’t
list
this
one
although
i
would
assume
this
would
be
quite
a
substantial
change
if
they
were
changing
--.
particularly
since
the
deed
list
one,
it
wasn’t
made.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
you're
still
applying
this
six
months
requirement
for
purposes
of
computation.
unknown
speaker
well,
you’re
not
ignoring
it.
