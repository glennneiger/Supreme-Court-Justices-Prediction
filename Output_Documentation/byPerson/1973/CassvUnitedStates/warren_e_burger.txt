that
plea
will
be
granted
mr.
hanson,
you
may
take
even
a
little
more
time
if
you
need
it.
chief

e.

yes

it’s
a
term
at

chief

not

is

chief

e.

the
term
at
least
modifying
five
years
is
not
in
the
6330,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
said,
if
you
had
that
kind
of
a
provision
in
687,
you
would
have
a
different
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn’t
it
reasonable
that
congress
intended
to
give
a
greater
boon
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
to
a
man
who
had
served
five
or
less
months
or
four
years
almost
than
someone
who
had
just
served
four
years
and
had
been
extended?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
my
question
is,
is
it
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
was
prepared
--
had
a
different
attitude
toward
so
called
20-year
people
than
4-year
people
who
might
serve
a
little
bit
over?
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
dougherty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
help
your
case
any
mr.
dougherty
that
the
statute
justice
stewart
just
cited
to
you
contains
an
expressed
provision
for
rounding
out
when
there's
less
than
the
full
period
and
the
statute
contains
no
such
rounding
out
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
at
least
is
--
those
are
two
pretty
important
words
in
that
statute,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
dougherty.
mr.
patton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
especially
when
the
report
contained
the
statement
that
there's
no
substantive
change,
someone
might
ask
if
the
difference
between
three
and
five
wasn’t
substantive,
one
would
assume
that
someone
in
congress
would
think
about.
