justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn’t
that
be
equally
true
under
6330?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it’s
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
submission
but
i’m
just
asking
now
about
this
little
argument
you’ve
made
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
less
than
six
months
would
have
no
meaning
if
the
petitioner’s
construction
were
accepted.
but
the
less
than
six
months
has
no
meaning
from
the
point
of
eligibility
under
6330
even
though
you
concede
that
the
petitioners
--
that
that
means
commissioning
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
so,
does
that
for
computation.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
arguments
--
your
argument
would
be
equally
applicable
to
6330.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
in
this
case,
we
only
have
one
subsection.
and
that’s
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
statute
for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection,
what
are
you
going
to
--
you
can’t
say
(b)
and
(c)
here
because
there
is
no
(b)
and
(c),
there's
only
one.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
where
you
differ
from
your
brothers
on
the
other
side,
they
say
it
is
very
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
have
a
different
situation
here
mr.
dougherty.
justice
potter
stewart
up
until
1962,
it
was
very
clear
that
this
statute
meant
precisely
what
the
government
now
says.
it
means
up
to
1962,
you
wouldn’t
have
had
any
case
at
all,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
none
and
because
the
statute
was
crystal
clear
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
they
applied
only
to
those
who
had
served
actually
five
years
or
more.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
what
happened
was
there
was
recodified
and
there's
a
statement
in
one
of
the
committee
reports,
that
of
the
senate
that
no
change
was
intended.
so
it’s
quite
a
different
situation
from
the
language
of
1330
which
has
remained
unchanged
from
its
enactment,
hasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
nevertheless
between
1956
and
1962,
it
would’ve
been
quite
clear
that
the
statutes
have
a
different
meaning.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn’t
that
be
equally
true
under
6330?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it’s
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
submission
but
i’m
just
asking
now
about
this
little
argument
you’ve
made
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
less

but

even

--
that

--
justice

justice

so
the

justice
