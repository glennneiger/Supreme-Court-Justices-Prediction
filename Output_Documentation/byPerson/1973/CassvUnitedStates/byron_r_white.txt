under

less

so
that
would
have
no
conceivable
application

it?

well,
i
don’t
see
how
it
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
--
i
can
see
how
--
you
might
arguably
say
the
first
part
of
section
2
applies
that
to
eligibility
as
well
as
computation
but
the
last
part
of
it
i
would
think
would
apply
--
could
apply
only
to
computation.
and
so
arguably,
the
whole
section
2
is
a
computation
section.

these
cases
come
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
disagreed
with
court
of
claims
on
the
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute
granting
readjustment
paid
to
certain
reserve
officers
when
they
are
involuntarily
released
from
the
service.
the
question
is
the
length
of
time
that
an
officer
must
serve
before
qualifying
for
readjustment
to
pay.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
we
have
filed,
we
agree
with
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
therefore
affirm
the
judgment.
