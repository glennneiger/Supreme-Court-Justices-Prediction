mr.
william
l.
patton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government’s
view
is
that
this
case
presents
an
instance
where
a
mistake
was
made
in
the
codification
of
the
statute.
petitioners
contend
that
the
act
is
clear
on
its
face
and
that
because
it
is
clear,
this
court
cannot
look
to
either
the
antecedent
statute
or
the
legislative
history
of
the
1962
codification
in
construing
the
act.
and
alternatively,
they
argue
that
the
legislative
history
supports
their
claim
that
in
1962,
congress
intended
to
change
the
eligibility
requirement.
our
position
is
that
the
statute
is
not
clear
and
that
any
doubt
as
to
its
meaning
is
dispelled
by
a
consideration
of
the
antecedent
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
and
even
if
the
statute
redeemed
clear
on
the
first
examination,
there
surely
is
no
rule
which
forbids
resort
to
aids
and
construction.
and
indeed,
resort
to
such
aids
is
particularly
--
excuse
me,
particularly
appropriate
in
the
case
of
codified
statute.
now,
when
we
begin
with
subsection
(a)
of
the
adjustment
act,
we
find
that
it
deals
with
two
subjects.
first,
congress
expressly
fixed
the
eligibility
requirement
at
five
years
of
continuous
act
of
service.
it
then
provided
that
the
amount
of
pay
would
be
computed
by
multiplying
years
of
service
by
two
months
basic
pay.
because
calculation
of
amount
of
pay
rests
on
years
of
service,
it
was
then
necessary
to
account
for
fractional
service.
and
we
submit
that
the
“rounding”
provision,
that
part
of
a
year
which
is
six
months
or
more
shall
be
counted
as
a
year
and
less
than
six
months
disregarded
applies
to
calculation
and
only
to
calculation.
we
have
a
hypothetical
in
our
brief,
which
illustrates
our
position
clearly.
if
a
serviceman
had
served
four
years
and
eight
months,
he
would
not
in
our
view
be
eligible
for
adjustment
pay.
if
however,
he
had
served
13
years
and
four
months,
he
would
be
eligible
and
the
amount
of
the
pay
would
be
computed
by
multiplying
13
by
two
months
of
basic
pay,
the
four
months
being
disregarded
under
the
“rounding”
provision.
if
he
had
served
13
years
and
eight
months,
it
would
be
calculated
by
multiplying
two
months
basic
pay
by
14
years,
the
eighth
months
being
counted
as
a
year
under
the
“rounding”
provision.
it
would
be
possible
to
read
the
“rounding”
provision
to
apply
to
its
eligibility
by
focusing
on
the
plural
purposes.
but
to
do
so
involves
a
number
of
problems.
one
as
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out
that
part
of
the
“rounding”
provision,
which
calls
for
disregarding
less
than
six
months,
has
no
application.
secondly
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
would
be
under
6330.
that’s
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
with
respect
to
6330,
our
position
is
that
that
statute
is
more
clear
than
the
adjustment
pay
act.
mr.
william
l.
patton
and
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
agree
that
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
has
meaning
for
computation,
6330.
mr.
william
l.
patton
for
computation,
that’s
right.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct
and
frankly,
i
find
6330
on
the
first
examination
is
somewhat
curious.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
i
think
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
right.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct
and
i
don’t
suggest
that
this
statute
is
a
model
of
clarity
and
i
do
say
that
if
6330
were
involved
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
right
mr.
justice
stewart
that’s
where
we
disagree.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
court
can
resort
to
aids
and
construction
in
determining
what
congress
intended
with
this
provision.
now,
an
additional
factor
is
that
in
the
adjustment
pay
act,
congress
specifically
required
five
years
of
continuous
service
for
eligibility.
a
“rounding”
provision
would
not
be
necessary
for
eligibility.
i
agree
it
would
not
be
necessary
in
6330
either.
and
since
a
“rounding”
provision
really
serves
only
one
function
as
a
matter
of
necessity,
we
submit
that
the
words
immediately
preceding
it
in
the
adjustment
pay
act
for
the
purposes
of
this
section
are
ambiguous.
and
any
doubt
as
to
what
congress
intended
is
dispelled
by
a
consideration
of
the
original
act
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
1962
codification.
the
adjustment
pay
was
established
in
1956
and
at
that
time
there
was
no
ambiguity
in
the
statute.
that
act
required
five
years
continuous
service
and
then
with
respect
to
the
“rounding”
provision,
it
expressly
stated
that
the
“rounding”
provision
was
to
be
applied
in
computing
the
amounts
of
adjustment
pay.
the
eligibility
requirement
and
the
restriction
of
the
“rounding”
provision
to
computation
remained
unchanged
until
1962.
in
1962,
congress
recodified
recent
military
pay
legislation.
and
in
the
course
of
codification,
the
words
preceding
the
“rounding”
provision
were
changed
from,
“for
the
purposes
of
computing
the
amount
of
adjustment
pay”
to
“for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection.”
that
this
change
was
inadvertent,
is
demonstrated
by
consideration
of
the
legislative
history.
the
senate
report
states
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended.
while
the
senate
and
house
reports
purport
to
list
all
changes
made
in
the
codified
legislation,
the
change
in
the
“rounding”
provision
is
not
referred
to.
there
are
no
debates,
no
hearings,
indeed,
no
reference
to
changing
the
eligibility
requirement.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
it’s
a
little
more
than
just
the
absence
of
legislative
history
because
there
isn’t
affirmative
statement
in
the
senate
report
that
no
substantive
changes
were
intended.
mr.
william
l.
patton
the
house
report
does
not
contain
that
statement.
basically,
the
house
report
simply
lists
the
changes
made.
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
doesn’t
list
this
one.
the
reports
are
somewhat
confused.
the
reports
lists
these
changes
the
omission
of
the
words
“for
the
purposes
of
its
surplusage”
but
in
fact
that
phrase
was
not
omitted.
now,
another
point
is
that
substantive
changes
in
military
legislation
are
ordinarily
made
under
the
supervision
of
the
armed
forces
committees
of
the
senate
house.
but
the
codification
was
carried
out
by
the
judiciary
committee
so
it
would’ve
been
most
unusual
for
them
to
make
substantive
changes.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
if
that’s
what
happened.
appellee,
that’s
not
presented
here.
i
take
the
reason
would
be
much
more
difficult
is
because
there’s
a
certain
specificity
about
numbers.
that
would
make
it
difficult
to
argue
that
no
change
was
intended.
i
think
it
unlikely
that
that
would
have
escaped
unnoticed.
now,
i
think
when
you
consider
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
would
certainly
hope
so.
i
think
when
you
consider
the
original
act
in
the
legislative
history,
there
really
is
no
dispute
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
change
the
eligibility
requirement.
as
i
understand
the
petitioner’s
argument
from
their
briefs,
their
argument
essentially
is
that
this
court
can’t
look
at
the
original
statute
or
the
legislative
history.
but
that
the
government
must
be
bound
by
what
they
consider
to
be
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language.
now,
in
support
of
the
plain
meaning
doctrine,
the
petitioners
rely
largely
on
older
precedents
of
this
court,
many
of
them,
19th
century
decisions.
if
the
plain
meaning
was
ever
applied
in
the
pristine
form
contended
for
by
the
petitioners,
it
can
no
longer
be
deemed
controlling.
i
suggest
that
upon
analysis,
most
cases,
which
invoke
the
plain
meaning
doctrine,
do
not
in
fact
apply
it.
in
any
event
as
this
court
has
said
in
american
trucking
--
united
states
versus
american
trucking
which
is
cited
at
page
22
of
our
brief,
when
aid
to
construction
of
the
meaning
of
words,
as
used
in
the
statute
is
available,
there
certainly
can
be
no
rule
of
law
which
forbids
its
use,
however
clear
the
words
may
appear
on
superficial
examination.
now
the
resort
to
aids
and
construction
is
particularly
appropriate
when
codified
statutes
are
in
dispute.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
22
of
our
brief,
we’ve
cited
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
indicate
the
changes
in
the
language
and
codification
do
not
ordinarily
result
in
changes
of
meaning
even
where
a
literal
reading
might
result
in
a
substantive
change.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
l.
patton
it’s
my
understanding
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
it’s
my
understanding
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
have
not
though
--
it’s
our
position
that
the
court
can
construe
the
statute
in
accordance
with
what
we
think
the
congress's
purpose
clearly
was
and
then
it’s
not
necessary
to
go
back
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
that
rests
on
our
position.
that
is
the
codified
statute.
and
that
this
court
can
look
to
the
amnestied
act
in
the
legislative
history
in
construing
its
terms.
mr.
william
l.
patton
oh!
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
original
act,
which
had
the
restriction
in
it,
the
“rounding”
provision
applied
only
to
computation.
and
the
senate
report
in
the
codification
which
states
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended
that
i
think
it
follows
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended
and
that
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
the
house
report
is
silent
on
this
matter.
there
were
no
hearings.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
there's
a
complete
absence
of
any
suggestion
that
congress
has
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
if
changing
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
perhaps
i
have
misled
the
court.
i
don’t
suggest
that
the
statute
is
clear.
i
think
the
statute
is
unclear.
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
cause
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
don’t
think
congress
intended
to
change
the
eligibility
requirement.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
no,
i
don’t
say
that.
i
mean
the
statute
was
passed.
i
say
that
the
omission
of
the
words
for
the
purposes
of
computing
the
amount
of
pay
was
inadvertent.
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
think
it
was
unintentional.
there's
no
suggestion
anywhere
that
the
congress
intended
to
reduce
the
eligibility
requirement.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
i
think
its
clear
that
it
was
inadvertent.
and
i
hope
the
court
will
agree
with
me
after
looking
at
the
legislative
history.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
the
court
of
claims
found
the
statute
clear
in
its
face
and
requiring
four-and-a-half
years
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
ninth
circuit
found
it
clear
and
requiring
five
years.
mr.
william
l.
patton
no,
i’m
saying
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
i
believe
this
court
may
construe
it
in
accordance
with
the
purposes
of
--
that
congress
as
found
in
the
legislative
history.
for
example,
in
city
of
greenwood
against
peacock,
which
involved
the
application
of
the
federal
civil
rights,
removal
statute,
to
prosecutions
against
private
citizens,
this
court
found
that
the
original
removal
statute
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
had
provided
for
removal
of
prosecutions
against
officers
or
other
persons.
in
1948
when
congress
codified
what
is
now
title
28
of
the
code,
that
phrase
was
omitted.
and
relying
on
the
legislative
history,
reports
which
stated
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended,
this
court
read
the
statute
as
though
that
phrase
had
not
been
omitted.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
it
may
have
been
in
both
the
senate
and
house
reports
but
i
don’t
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
we
only
have
one
sentence
of
that
--
affirmative
sentence
but
we
have
no
indication
that
there
was
any
consideration
given
to
changing
the
eligibility
requirements.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
that
doesn’t
suggest
--
it
doesn't
aindicate
considerations.
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
have
no
doubt
mr.
justice
marshall
that
that
occurs
in
some
cases
in
terms
of
technical
language
of
the
bill.
now,
i’d
just
like
to
add
finally
that
the
construction
which
the
government
urges
is
supported
by
an
established
administrative
construction.
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
defense
and
the
pay
manuals
of
the
services
if
uniformly
construed
the
“rounding”
provision
as
applicable
only
to
computation.
and
finally,
page
11
of
our
brief,
we’ve
listed
a
number
of
statutes
which
include
the
“rounding”
provision
and
we
submit
that
our
construction
is
consistent
with
the
pattern
of
similar
legislation.
five
years
of
continuous
active
service
is
required
for
eligibility.
none
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
has
served
five
years
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
l.
patton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government’s
view
is
that
this
case
presents
an
instance
where
a
mistake
was
made
in
the
codification
of
the
statute.
petitioners
contend
that
the
act
is
clear
on
its
face
and
that
because
it
is
clear,
this
court
cannot
look
to
either
the
antecedent
statute
or
the
legislative
history
of
the
1962
codification
in
construing
the
act.
and
alternatively,
they
argue
that
the
legislative
history
supports
their
claim
that
in
1962,
congress
intended
to
change
the
eligibility
requirement.
our
position
is
that
the
statute
is
not
clear
and
that
any
doubt
as
to
its
meaning
is
dispelled
by
a
consideration
of
the
antecedent
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
and
even
if
the
statute
redeemed
clear
on
the
first
examination,
there
surely
is
no
rule
which
forbids
resort
to
aids
and
construction.
and
indeed,
resort
to
such
aids
is
particularly
--
excuse
me,
particularly
appropriate
in
the
case
of
codified
statute.
now,
when
we
begin
with
subsection
(a)
of
the
adjustment
act,
we
find
that
it
deals
with
two
subjects.
first,
congress
expressly
fixed
the
eligibility
requirement
at
five
years
of
continuous
act
of
service.
it
then
provided
that
the
amount
of
pay
would
be
computed
by
multiplying
years
of
service
by
two
months
basic
pay.
because
calculation
of
amount
of
pay
rests
on
years
of
service,
it
was
then
necessary
to
account
for
fractional
service.
and
we
submit
that
the
“rounding”
provision,
that
part
of
a
year
which
is
six
months
or
more
shall
be
counted
as
a
year
and
less
than
six
months
disregarded
applies
to
calculation
and
only
to
calculation.
we
have
a
hypothetical
in
our
brief,
which
illustrates
our
position
clearly.
if
a
serviceman
had
served
four
years
and
eight
months,
he
would
not
in
our
view
be
eligible
for
adjustment
pay.
if
however,
he
had
served
13
years
and
four
months,
he
would
be
eligible
and
the
amount
of
the
pay
would
be
computed
by
multiplying
13
by
two
months
of
basic
pay,
the
four
months
being
disregarded
under
the
“rounding”
provision.
if
he
had
served
13
years
and
eight
months,
it
would
be
calculated
by
multiplying
two
months
basic
pay
by
14
years,
the
eighth
months
being
counted
as
a
year
under
the
“rounding”
provision.
it
would
be
possible
to
read
the
“rounding”
provision
to
apply
to
its
eligibility
by
focusing
on
the
plural
purposes.
but
to
do
so
involves
a
number
of
problems.
one
as
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out
that
part
of
the
“rounding”
provision,
which
calls
for
disregarding
less
than
six
months,
has
no
application.
secondly
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
would
be
under
6330.
that’s
right
mr.
justice
stewart
and
with
respect
to
6330,
our
position
is
that
that
statute
is
more
clear
than
the
adjustment
pay
act.
mr.
william
l.
patton
and
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
agree
that
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
has
meaning
for
computation,
6330.
mr.
william
l.
patton
for
computation,
that’s
right.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct
and
frankly,
i
find
6330
on
the
first
examination
is
somewhat
curious.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
i
think
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
right.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct
and
i
don’t
suggest
that
this
statute
is
a
model
of
clarity
and
i
do
say
that
if
6330
were
involved
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
right
mr.
justice
stewart
that’s
where
we
disagree.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
court
can
resort
to
aids
and
construction
in
determining
what
congress
intended
with
this
provision.
now,
an
additional
factor
is
that
in
the
adjustment
pay
act,
congress
specifically
required
five
years
of
continuous
service
for
eligibility.
a
“rounding”
provision
would
not
be
necessary
for
eligibility.
i
agree
it
would
not
be
necessary
in
6330
either.
and
since
a
“rounding”
provision
really
serves
only
one
function
as
a
matter
of
necessity,
we
submit
that
the
words
immediately
preceding
it
in
the
adjustment
pay
act
for
the
purposes
of
this
section
are
ambiguous.
and
any
doubt
as
to
what
congress
intended
is
dispelled
by
a
consideration
of
the
original
act
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
1962
codification.
the
adjustment
pay
was
established
in
1956
and
at
that
time
there
was
no
ambiguity
in
the
statute.
that
act
required
five
years
continuous
service
and
then
with
respect
to
the
“rounding”
provision,
it
expressly
stated
that
the
“rounding”
provision
was
to
be
applied
in
computing
the
amounts
of
adjustment
pay.
the
eligibility
requirement
and
the
restriction
of
the
“rounding”
provision
to
computation
remained
unchanged
until
1962.
in
1962,
congress
recodified
recent
military
pay
legislation.
and
in
the
course
of
codification,
the
words
preceding
the
“rounding”
provision
were
changed
from,
“for
the
purposes
of
computing
the
amount
of
adjustment
pay”
to
“for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection.”
that
this
change
was
inadvertent,
is
demonstrated
by
consideration
of
the
legislative
history.
the
senate
report
states
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended.
while
the
senate
and
house
reports
purport
to
list
all
changes
made
in
the
codified
legislation,
the
change
in
the
“rounding”
provision
is
not
referred
to.
there
are
no
debates,
no
hearings,
indeed,
no
reference
to
changing
the
eligibility
requirement.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
it’s
a
little
more
than
just
the
absence
of
legislative
history
because
there
isn’t
affirmative
statement
in
the
senate
report
that
no
substantive
changes
were
intended.
mr.
william
l.
patton
the
house
report
does
not
contain
that
statement.
basically,
the
house
report
simply
lists
the
changes
made.
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
doesn’t
list
this
one.
the
reports
are
somewhat
confused.
the
reports
lists
these
changes
the
omission
of
the
words
“for
the
purposes
of
its
surplusage”
but
in
fact
that
phrase
was
not
omitted.
now,
another
point
is
that
substantive
changes
in
military
legislation
are
ordinarily
made
under
the
supervision
of
the
armed
forces
committees
of
the
senate
house.
but
the
codification
was
carried
out
by
the
judiciary
committee
so
it
would’ve
been
most
unusual
for
them
to
make
substantive
changes.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
if
that’s
what
happened.
appellee,
that’s
not
presented
here.
i
take
the
reason
would
be
much
more
difficult
is
because
there’s
a
certain
specificity
about
numbers.
that
would
make
it
difficult
to
argue
that
no
change
was
intended.
i
think
it
unlikely
that
that
would
have
escaped
unnoticed.
now,
i
think
when
you
consider
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
would
certainly
hope
so.
i
think
when
you
consider
the
original
act
in
the
legislative
history,
there
really
is
no
dispute
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
change
the
eligibility
requirement.
as
i
understand
the
petitioner’s
argument
from
their
briefs,
their
argument
essentially
is
that
this
court
can’t
look
at
the
original
statute
or
the
legislative
history.
but
that
the
government
must
be
bound
by
what
they
consider
to
be
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language.
now,
in
support
of
the
plain
meaning
doctrine,
the
petitioners
rely
largely
on
older
precedents
of
this
court,
many
of
them,
19th
century
decisions.
if
the
plain
meaning
was
ever
applied
in
the
pristine
form
contended
for
by
the
petitioners,
it
can
no
longer
be
deemed
controlling.
i
suggest
that
upon
analysis,
most
cases,
which
invoke
the
plain
meaning
doctrine,
do
not
in
fact
apply
it.
in
any
event
as
this
court
has
said
in
american
trucking
--
united
states
versus
american
trucking
which
is
cited
at
page
22
of
our
brief,
when
aid
to
construction
of
the
meaning
of
words,
as
used
in
the
statute
is
available,
there
certainly
can
be
no
rule
of
law
which
forbids
its
use,
however
clear
the
words
may
appear
on
superficial
examination.
now
the
resort
to
aids
and
construction
is
particularly
appropriate
when
codified
statutes
are
in
dispute.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
22
of
our
brief,
we’ve
cited
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
indicate
the
changes
in
the
language
and
codification
do
not
ordinarily
result
in
changes
of
meaning
even
where
a
literal
reading
might
result
in
a
substantive
change.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
l.
patton
it’s
my
understanding
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
it’s
my
understanding
mr.
justice
marshall
that
we
have
not
though
--
it’s
our
position
that
the
court
can
construe
the
statute
in
accordance
with
what
we
think
the
congress's
purpose
clearly
was
and
then
it’s
not
necessary
to
go
back
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
that
rests
on
our
position.
that
is
the
codified
statute.
and
that
this
court
can
look
to
the
amnestied
act
in
the
legislative
history
in
construing
its
terms.
mr.
william
l.
patton
oh!
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
original
act,
which
had
the
restriction
in
it,
the
“rounding”
provision
applied
only
to
computation.
and
the
senate
report
in
the
codification
which
states
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended
that
i
think
it
follows
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended
and
that
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
the
house
report
is
silent
on
this
matter.
there
were
no
hearings.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
there's
a
complete
absence
of
any
suggestion
that
congress
has
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
if
changing
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
perhaps
i
have
misled
the
court.
i
don’t
suggest
that
the
statute
is
clear.
i
think
the
statute
is
unclear.
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
cause
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
don’t
think
congress
intended
to
change
the
eligibility
requirement.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
no,
i
don’t
say
that.
i
mean
the
statute
was
passed.
i
say
that
the
omission
of
the
words
for
the
purposes
of
computing
the
amount
of
pay
was
inadvertent.
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
think
it
was
unintentional.
there's
no
suggestion
anywhere
that
the
congress
intended
to
reduce
the
eligibility
requirement.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
i
think
its
clear
that
it
was
inadvertent.
and
i
hope
the
court
will
agree
with
me
after
looking
at
the
legislative
history.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
the
court
of
claims
found
the
statute
clear
in
its
face
and
requiring
four-and-a-half
years
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
ninth
circuit
found
it
clear
and
requiring
five
years.
mr.
william
l.
patton
no,
i’m
saying
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
i
believe
this
court
may
construe
it
in
accordance
with
the
purposes
of
--
that
congress
as
found
in
the
legislative
history.
for
example,
in
city
of
greenwood
against
peacock,
which
involved
the
application
of
the
federal
civil
rights,
removal
statute,
to
prosecutions
against
private
citizens,
this
court
found
that
the
original
removal
statute
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
had
provided
for
removal
of
prosecutions
against
officers
or
other
persons.
in
1948
when
congress
codified
what
is
now
title
28
of
the
code,
that
phrase
was
omitted.
and
relying
on
the
legislative
history,
reports
which
stated
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended,
this
court
read
the
statute
as
though
that
phrase
had
not
been
omitted.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
it
may
have
been
in
both
the
senate
and
house
reports
but
i
don’t
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
we
only
have
one
sentence
of
that
--
affirmative
sentence
but
we
have
no
indication
that
there
was
any
consideration
given
to
changing
the
eligibility
requirements.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
that
doesn’t
suggest
--
it
doesn't
aindicate
considerations.
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
have
no
doubt
mr.
justice
marshall
that
that
occurs
in
some
cases
in
terms
of
technical
language
of
the
bill.
now,
i’d
just
like
to
add
finally
that
the
construction
which
the
government
urges
is
supported
by
an
established
administrative
construction.
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
defense
and
the
pay
manuals
of
the
services
if
uniformly
construed
the
“rounding”
provision
as
applicable
only
to
computation.
and
finally,
page
11
of
our
brief,
we’ve
listed
a
number
of
statutes
which
include
the
“rounding”
provision
and
we
submit
that
our
construction
is
consistent
with
the
pattern
of
similar
legislation.
five
years
of
continuous
active
service
is
required
for
eligibility.
none
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
has
served
five
years
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
