mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
mr.
chief
justice,
distinguished
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
did
not
receive
the
reply
brief
in
this
matter
until
this
past
friday.
we
would
ask
the
court’s
indulgence
in
permitting
us
to
file
a
typewritten
brief
in
reply,
if
we
may
certainly
not
later
at
the
end
of
this
week.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
thank
you
sir.
this
applies
of
course
to
my
brother
dougherty
who
is
arguing
the
other
cases.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
and
your
honors,
we
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
two
items.
one
appearing
at
page
20
and
another,
21
of
the
solicitor
general’s
brief.
the
footnote
on
page
20
refers
to
the
time,
that
the
government
filed
its
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
schmid
against
the
united
states.
and
it
discusses
the
fact
that
this
might
increase
the
government’s
potential
liability
by
more
than
$12
million
if
that
case
were
not
reversed.
i
had
the
pleasure
of
arguing
schmid
in
the
court
of
claims
and
i
protested
vehemently
at
that
time
that
this
remark
was
placed
in
the
schmid
petition
to
this
court
that
it
was
outside
the
record.
this
was
never
raised
in
the
court
below,
and
the
court
of
claims,
it’s
never
been
raised
in
the
ninth
circuit
nor
in
the
district
courts
that
have
considered
this
matter
and
i
think
it
is
inappropriate
as
it
be
brought
before
the
court,
i
would
ask
that
it
be
disregarded.
truthfully,
they
can
find
out
what
it
would
cost
but
they
never
have
and
they
never
tried
to
put
it
into
the
record.
i
don’t
think
it
should
be
here
today.
secondly,
on
page
21,
i
would
almost
say
the
freudian
slip
but
i
will
term
it
inadvertence.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
when
they
quote
under
paragraph
number
two,
they
say,
“for
the
purpose
of
this
subsection”
when
they
are
trying
to
discuss
our
approach
to
interpreting
the
statute.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
note
that
this
was
done
in
schmid
and
it
was
done
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
here
it
is
again.
we
have
repeatedly
called
the
government’s
attention
that
the
statute
reads
“for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection”
and
that
is
highly
important
and
we’re
sorry
that
it
slipped
back
in.
now,
if
i
may
i’ll
address
my
remarks
to
the
case
in
chief.
we
are
here
primarily
on
a
matter
involving
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
the
statute
involved
is
10
u.s.c.
687
(a).
an
impertinent
part,
that
statute
involves
reserve
officers
of
all
the
services
who
have
served
more
than
their
--
one
might
say
indentured
service
in
a
sense
whether
they
were
in
the
draft
call
or
whether
they
were
called
up
for
some
other
purpose,
they
have
served
more
than
four
years.
and
then
have
extended
onward
their
service
at
the
request
of
the
government
and
then
were
discharged
involuntarily
before
they
reached
a
fifth
year
of
service
when
the
war
in
vietnam
was
winding
down
and
they
were
released
just
prior
to
the
fifth
year,
in
many
instances
within
a
few
days
of
having
completed
five
years
of
service.
now,
we
have
cited
this
statute
for
purposes
of
this
discussion
before
the
court.
if
you
see
page
two
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
it
forth
and
i
think
that
since
we’re
dealing
with
the
exact
language,
i
would
like
to
recite
it
to
you
in
a
sense.
we
say,
“non-regulars:
readjustment
payment
upon
involuntary
release
from
active
duty.
“except
for
members
covered
by
subsection
(b),
a
member
of
the
reserve
--
of
a
reserve
component
or
a
member
of
the
army
or
the
air
force
without
component
who
is
released
from
active
duty
involuntarily,
or
because
he
was
not
accepted
for
an
additional
tour
of
active
duty
for
which
he
volunteered
after
he’d
completed
a
tour
of
active
duty,
and
who
has
completed
immediately
before
his
release,
at
least
five
years
of
continuous
active
duty,
is
entitled
to
a
readjustment
payment
computed
by
multiplying
his
years
of
active
service
other
than
in
time
of
war
or
of
national
emergency
declared
by
congress
after
june
28,
1962,
but
not
more
than
eighteen,
by
two
months'
basic
pay
of
the
grade
in
which
he
is
serving
at
the
time
of
his
release.
for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection,
(1)
a
period
of
active
duty
is
continuous,
if
it
is
not
interrupted
by
a
break
in
service
of
more
than
30
days;
and
(2)
a
part
of
a
year
that
is
six
months
or
more
is
counted
as
a
whole
year,
and
a
part
of
a
year
that
is
less
than
six
months
is
disregarded.
now
with
that
statute
in
front
of
you,
with
nothing
else
before
you,
i
think
the
court
would
reach
the
same
conclusion
that
the
court
of
claims
did.
and
we
urge
that
the
court
read
carefully
the
decision
schmid.
as
you
may
recall
your
honors,
you
rejected
the
petitioners’
certiorari
in
schmid
by
applying
the
two
votes.
now,
what
has
happened
is
that
a
number
of
officers
in
schmid’s
case,
he
had
a
requirement
for
some
$13,000.00
or
$14,000.00,
so
he
had
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims
on
the
jurisdiction.
certain
of
the
other
people
involved
have
gone
to
the
federal
district
court
as
a
matter
of
convenience
because
they
had
$10,000.00
or
less
dollars
involved
that
jurisdictionally,
they
could
use
the
district
court.
and
that’s
why
we
are
here
today.
cass
was
one
of
those
who
had
$10,000.00,
some
odd
dollars
and
he
waved
the
above
$10,000.00
to
come
here
in
the
district
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
in
this
particular
part
of
the
statute
--
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
your
honor,
these
are
all
officers
but
it
would
be
my
view
that
it’s
applicable
to
all
members
of
the
reserve
who
are
in
there
on
a
voluntary
extension
of
their
four-year
enlistment
period.
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
many
of
these
people
officers
and
men
served
more
than
the
five
years
during
the
vietnam
unpleasantness
which
was
not
declared
a
state
of
emergency
or
a
war
and
that’s
why
the
terms
of
the
statute
but
those
have
already
been
taken
care
of
by
recomputation.
it
happens
that
this
applies
only
to
those
who
had
extended
their
service
expecting
to
go
on
for
as
long
as
the
government
needed
them
and
then
when
the
government
saw
that
situation
lining
down,
they
quickly
got
a
number
of
them
out
before
they
completed
the
fifth
year.
it
might
interest
you
to
know
that
schmid
in
that
case
had
served
four
years
plus
in
a
previous
enlistment
as
an
enlisted
man
and
then
came
back
in
the
navy
as
an
officer
and
served
four
years,
six
months
and
some
odd
days.
so
that
when
actually
we
went
in
for
his
case,
we
were
dealing
with
a
recomputation
based
on
his
total
years
of
service
which
gave
him
something
in
excess
of
$13,000.00
as
opposed
to
the
smaller
amounts
here
although
he
is
of
a
similar
rank.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
because
the
statute
very
clearly
states
that
a
period
of
active
duty
is
continuous
if
it
is
not
interrupted
by
a
break
in
service
of
more
than
30
days.
but
i’m
glad
you
raised
that
because
that
again
emphasizes
the
defining
portions
of
the
statute.
the
statute’s
main
body
is
defined
in
two
areas.
“for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection;
(1)
a
period
of
active
duty
is
continuous,
if
it
is
not
interrupted
by
a
break
in
service
of
more
than
30
days.
if
it
had
been
interrupted
by
a
break
in
service
of
more
than
30
days
such
as
the
five
months
you
raised,
then
he
would
not
qualify
for
this
statute.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
because
another
section
of
the
statute
covers
it.
the
other
section
says,
“a
part
of
a
year
that’s
six
months
or
more
is
counted
as
a
whole
year,
and
a
part
of
a
year
that
is
less
than
six
months
is
disregarded
for
--
this
is
for
purposes
of
eligibility
in
that
sense
whereas
if
he
doesn’t
have
unbroken
active
duty,
if
it's
only
broken
for
30
days,
he
still
qualifies
under
section
2.
but
if
he
has
a
break
of
more
than
30
days,
he
is
disqualified
and
he
is
eliminated
from
it
under
section
1.
and
what
i’m
suggesting
to
your
honor
is
that
you
will
find
that
you
must
read
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
to
qualify
a
statute
by
the
language
in
the
following
part
of
it.
now,
i
will
call
your
attention
to
6330,
title
10,
u.s.c
6330,
which
is
quoted
on
page
11
of
our
brief.
and
that
again
is
interesting
because
it
is
applicable
to
exactly
the
same
sort
of
recomputation
and
eligibility.
that
applies
to
members
of
the
marine
corp
and
marine
corp
reserve,
they're
going
to
be
transferred
to
the
fleet
marine
corp
reserve.
it
says,
“for
the
purposes
of
subsections
(b)
and
(c),
a
part
of
a
year
that
is
six
months
or
more
is
counted
as
a
whole
year
and
a
part
of
a
year
that’s
less
than
six
months
is
disregarded.”
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
it
does
read
that
way
your
honor.
that’s
what
we
are
saying,
it
reads
exactly
that
way.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
they
are
different
in
one
sense.
but
6330
applies
to
someone
who
has
served
19
years
and
six
months
so
they
are
released
at
the
end
of
19
years
and
six
months
and
this
is
a
usual
thing
in
the
services
to
do
and
they
are
given
credit
for
that
remainder,
they're
given
19
years,
six
months
and
a
day
and
they
are
then
credited
with
20
years
of
service.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
that’s
right.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
sir?
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
no
your
honor
it
is
not
but
it
says,
“an
enlisted
member
of
the
regular
navy
or
the
naval
reserve
who’s
completed
20
or
more
years
of
active
service
in
the
armed
forces
may,
at
his
request,
be
transferred
to
the
fleet
reserve.”
then
they
say
for
the
purposes
of
this,
they
left
them
out
in
19-and-a-half
years
and
one
day.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
possibly
your
honor.
but
i
would
suggest
that
when
they
said
at
least
five
years
of
continuous
active
duty
and
then
they
come
down
and
tell
me
that
for
purposes
of
this
subsection
that
a
part
of
a
year
that’s
six
months
or
more
is
counted
as
a
whole
year,
then
he
has
completed
at
least
five
years
of
active
duty.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no
your
honor
because
those
people
are
what
we
call
the
20-year
group
and
they
have
been
in
for
20
years
and
are
entitled
to
retire
both
to
promotion
flow
and
other
items
whereas
these
people
are
called-in
in
a
time
of
emergency
such
as
the
vietnam
war.
most
of
these
people
were
draftees
who
came
in
for
an
initial
tour
of
four
years
and
then
they
extended
at
the
requirement
of
the
government
and
then
asked
to
continue
on
and
then
were
involuntarily
retired
when
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
government’s
budgetary
interest
to
reduce
them.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
i
would
have
some
question
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
reserve
officer
for
some
33
years
and
still
one.
i
think
the
congress
is
very
concerned
with
the
very
people
we’re
concerned
with
here.
and
i
would
point
out
one
other
thing
that
in
the
court’s
attempt
in
the
ninth
circuit
to
reach
that
conclusion,
they
may
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
senate
report
involves,
suggested
that
perhaps
there
was
not
subsidy
change
in
that
statute
when
it
was
recodified.
i’d
call
two
things
to
the
court’s
attention,
first,
6330
was
passed
in
1958.
that
was
subsequent
to
the
initial
passage
of
687
(a),
which
was
passed
in
1956.
when
they
recodified
these
matters
in
1962,
some
water
had
gone
under
the
bridge
and
we
believe
that
the
congress
intended
to
do
exactly
what
it
did.
they
don’t
mention
the
house
report.
this
bill
had
to
go
through
both
houses.
it
didn’t
just
go
through
the
senate.
and
the
fact
that
the
senate
said,
“well
we
don’t
think
this
is
any
substantive
change,”
is
really
immaterial
to
the
consideration
of
this
matter
because
when
it
was
passed
by
both
houses,
a
change
did
appear.
and
the
change
is
the
one
that
finds
687
(a)
exactly
as
the
court
of
claims
found
it.
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
language
in
the
court
of
claims
decision
where
they
went
behind
the
statute
and
stated
very
clearly
on
page
three
of
their
opinion
that
although
we
find
the
sections
clear
and
unambiguous
on
its
face
and
its
susceptible
on
its
face
of
only
one
interpretation.
they
then
go
on
to
say
although
we
find
no
ambiguity
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
we’re
not
precluded
from
examining
the
legislative
history
underlying
the
enactment
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
clear
and
compelling
support
for
the
interpretation.
they
then
went
on
to
say
that
after
a
careful
--
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
so
that
after
a
careful
review
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
687
(a),
then
we
can
conclude
that
support
which
it
lends
to
defendants
position,
namely
the
government,
is
not
so
clear
and
compelling
as
to
require
us
to
adopt
an
interpretation
of
the
section
inconsistent
with
a
clear
import
of
its
terms.
and
i
would
like
to
add
one
other
thing
if
i
may
--
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
it
would
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
white.
if
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
if
the
man
had
served
four
years,
five
months
and
27
days
in
a
leap
year
february,
well,
he
certainly
would
have
served
less
than
six
months
then
he
would
not
be
eligible.
but
if
he
had
served
four
years,
six
months
and
one
day,
he
would
be
eligible.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well
again,
i
can
only
state
that
the
court
of
claims
did
review
this
with
great
care
and
they
addressed
that
argument
thoroughly.
i
would
urge
your
honors
to
address
it
carefully
and
i
think
one
of
the
items
that
persuade
it
and
i
was
about
to
call
your
attention
to
this
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
remedial
statute.
and
as
such,
it’s
our
view
that
it
must
be
most
carefully
construed
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i’m
not
being
fictitious
when
i
say
this
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
congress
does
many
things
that
i
wonder
about.
but
it’s
my
view
that
there
are
many
statutes
which
they
describe
in
terms
of
this
nature.
they
set
out
what
a
statute
is
and
then
they
put
a
caboose
on
it
so
to
speak
in
which
they
say,
“for
purposes
of
this
section,
we
mean
the
following.”
and
that’s
what
we
say
they’ve
done
here
and
this
isn’t
unusual.
my
time
is
up,
for
that,
i
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
mr.
chief
justice,
distinguished
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
did
not
receive
the
reply
brief
in
this
matter
until
this
past
friday.
we
would
ask
the
court’s
indulgence
in
permitting
us
to
file
a
typewritten
brief
in
reply,
if
we
may
certainly
not
later
at
the
end
of
this
week.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
thank
you
sir.
this
applies
of
course
to
my
brother
dougherty
who
is
arguing
the
other
cases.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
and
your
honors,
we
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
two
items.
one
appearing
at
page
20
and
another,
21
of
the
solicitor
general’s
brief.
the
footnote
on
page
20
refers
to
the
time,
that
the
government
filed
its
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
schmid
against
the
united
states.
and
it
discusses
the
fact
that
this
might
increase
the
government’s
potential
liability
by
more
than
$12
million
if
that
case
were
not
reversed.
i
had
the
pleasure
of
arguing
schmid
in
the
court
of
claims
and
i
protested
vehemently
at
that
time
that
this
remark
was
placed
in
the
schmid
petition
to
this
court
that
it
was
outside
the
record.
this
was
never
raised
in
the
court
below,
and
the
court
of
claims,
it’s
never
been
raised
in
the
ninth
circuit
nor
in
the
district
courts
that
have
considered
this
matter
and
i
think
it
is
inappropriate
as
it
be
brought
before
the
court,
i
would
ask
that
it
be
disregarded.
truthfully,
they
can
find
out
what
it
would
cost
but
they
never
have
and
they
never
tried
to
put
it
into
the
record.
i
don’t
think
it
should
be
here
today.
secondly,
on
page
21,
i
would
almost
say
the
freudian
slip
but
i
will
term
it
inadvertence.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
when
they
quote
under
paragraph
number
two,
they
say,
“for
the
purpose
of
this
subsection”
when
they
are
trying
to
discuss
our
approach
to
interpreting
the
statute.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
note
that
this
was
done
in
schmid
and
it
was
done
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
here
it
is
again.
we
have
repeatedly
called
the
government’s
attention
that
the
statute
reads
“for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection”
and
that
is
highly
important
and
we’re
sorry
that
it
slipped
back
in.
now,
if
i
may
i’ll
address
my
remarks
to
the
case
in
chief.
we
are
here
primarily
on
a
matter
involving
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
the
statute
involved
is
10
u.s.c.
687
(a).
an
impertinent
part,
that
statute
involves
reserve
officers
of
all
the
services
who
have
served
more
than
their
--
one
might
say
indentured
service
in
a
sense
whether
they
were
in
the
draft
call
or
whether
they
were
called
up
for
some
other
purpose,
they
have
served
more
than
four
years.
and
then
have
extended
onward
their
service
at
the
request
of
the
government
and
then
were
discharged
involuntarily
before
they
reached
a
fifth
year
of
service
when
the
war
in
vietnam
was
winding
down
and
they
were
released
just
prior
to
the
fifth
year,
in
many
instances
within
a
few
days
of
having
completed
five
years
of
service.
now,
we
have
cited
this
statute
for
purposes
of
this
discussion
before
the
court.
if
you
see
page
two
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
it
forth
and
i
think
that
since
we’re
dealing
with
the
exact
language,
i
would
like
to
recite
it
to
you
in
a
sense.
we
say,
“non-regulars:
readjustment
payment
upon
involuntary
release
from
active
duty.
“except
for
members
covered
by
subsection
(b),
a
member
of
the
reserve
--
of
a
reserve
component
or
a
member
of
the
army
or
the
air
force
without
component
who
is
released
from
active
duty
involuntarily,
or
because
he
was
not
accepted
for
an
additional
tour
of
active
duty
for
which
he
volunteered
after
he’d
completed
a
tour
of
active
duty,
and
who
has
completed
immediately
before
his
release,
at
least
five
years
of
continuous
active
duty,
is
entitled
to
a
readjustment
payment
computed
by
multiplying
his
years
of
active
service
other
than
in
time
of
war
or
of
national
emergency
declared
by
congress
after
june
28,
1962,
but
not
more
than
eighteen,
by
two
months'
basic
pay
of
the
grade
in
which
he
is
serving
at
the
time
of
his
release.
for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection,
(1)
a
period
of
active
duty
is
continuous,
if
it
is
not
interrupted
by
a
break
in
service
of
more
than
30
days;
and
(2)
a
part
of
a
year
that
is
six
months
or
more
is
counted
as
a
whole
year,
and
a
part
of
a
year
that
is
less
than
six
months
is
disregarded.
now
with
that
statute
in
front
of
you,
with
nothing
else
before
you,
i
think
the
court
would
reach
the
same
conclusion
that
the
court
of
claims
did.
and
we
urge
that
the
court
read
carefully
the
decision
schmid.
as
you
may
recall
your
honors,
you
rejected
the
petitioners’
certiorari
in
schmid
by
applying
the
two
votes.
now,
what
has
happened
is
that
a
number
of
officers
in
schmid’s
case,
he
had
a
requirement
for
some
$13,000.00
or
$14,000.00,
so
he
had
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims
on
the
jurisdiction.
certain
of
the
other
people
involved
have
gone
to
the
federal
district
court
as
a
matter
of
convenience
because
they
had
$10,000.00
or
less
dollars
involved
that
jurisdictionally,
they
could
use
the
district
court.
and
that’s
why
we
are
here
today.
cass
was
one
of
those
who
had
$10,000.00,
some
odd
dollars
and
he
waved
the
above
$10,000.00
to
come
here
in
the
district
court.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
in
this
particular
part
of
the
statute
--
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
your
honor,
these
are
all
officers
but
it
would
be
my
view
that
it’s
applicable
to
all
members
of
the
reserve
who
are
in
there
on
a
voluntary
extension
of
their
four-year
enlistment
period.
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
many
of
these
people
officers
and
men
served
more
than
the
five
years
during
the
vietnam
unpleasantness
which
was
not
declared
a
state
of
emergency
or
a
war
and
that’s
why
the
terms
of
the
statute
but
those
have
already
been
taken
care
of
by
recomputation.
it
happens
that
this
applies
only
to
those
who
had
extended
their
service
expecting
to
go
on
for
as
long
as
the
government
needed
them
and
then
when
the
government
saw
that
situation
lining
down,
they
quickly
got
a
number
of
them
out
before
they
completed
the
fifth
year.
it
might
interest
you
to
know
that
schmid
in
that
case
had
served
four
years
plus
in
a
previous
enlistment
as
an
enlisted
man
and
then
came
back
in
the
navy
as
an
officer
and
served
four
years,
six
months
and
some
odd
days.
so
that
when
actually
we
went
in
for
his
case,
we
were
dealing
with
a
recomputation
based
on
his
total
years
of
service
which
gave
him
something
in
excess
of
$13,000.00
as
opposed
to
the
smaller
amounts
here
although
he
is
of
a
similar
rank.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no,
because
the
statute
very
clearly
states
that
a
period
of
active
duty
is
continuous
if
it
is
not
interrupted
by
a
break
in
service
of
more
than
30
days.
but
i’m
glad
you
raised
that
because
that
again
emphasizes
the
defining
portions
of
the
statute.
the
statute’s
main
body
is
defined
in
two
areas.
“for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection;
(1)
a
period
of
active
duty
is
continuous,
if
it
is
not
interrupted
by
a
break
in
service
of
more
than
30
days.
if
it
had
been
interrupted
by
a
break
in
service
of
more
than
30
days
such
as
the
five
months
you
raised,
then
he
would
not
qualify
for
this
statute.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
because
another
section
of
the
statute
covers
it.
the
other
section
says,
“a
part
of
a
year
that’s
six
months
or
more
is
counted
as
a
whole
year,
and
a
part
of
a
year
that
is
less
than
six
months
is
disregarded
for
--
this
is
for
purposes
of
eligibility
in
that
sense
whereas
if
he
doesn’t
have
unbroken
active
duty,
if
it's
only
broken
for
30
days,
he
still
qualifies
under
section
2.
but
if
he
has
a
break
of
more
than
30
days,
he
is
disqualified
and
he
is
eliminated
from
it
under
section
1.
and
what
i’m
suggesting
to
your
honor
is
that
you
will
find
that
you
must
read
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
to
qualify
a
statute
by
the
language
in
the
following
part
of
it.
now,
i
will
call
your
attention
to
6330,
title
10,
u.s.c
6330,
which
is
quoted
on
page
11
of
our
brief.
and
that
again
is
interesting
because
it
is
applicable
to
exactly
the
same
sort
of
recomputation
and
eligibility.
that
applies
to
members
of
the
marine
corp
and
marine
corp
reserve,
they're
going
to
be
transferred
to
the
fleet
marine
corp
reserve.
it
says,
“for
the
purposes
of
subsections
(b)
and
(c),
a
part
of
a
year
that
is
six
months
or
more
is
counted
as
a
whole
year
and
a
part
of
a
year
that’s
less
than
six
months
is
disregarded.”
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
it
does
read
that
way
your
honor.
that’s
what
we
are
saying,
it
reads
exactly
that
way.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
they
are
different
in
one
sense.
but
6330
applies
to
someone
who
has
served
19
years
and
six
months
so
they
are
released
at
the
end
of
19
years
and
six
months
and
this
is
a
usual
thing
in
the
services
to
do
and
they
are
given
credit
for
that
remainder,
they're
given
19
years,
six
months
and
a
day
and
they
are
then
credited
with
20
years
of
service.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
that’s
right.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
sir?
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
no
your
honor
it
is
not
but
it
says,
“an
enlisted
member
of
the
regular
navy
or
the
naval
reserve
who’s
completed
20
or
more
years
of
active
service
in
the
armed
forces
may,
at
his
request,
be
transferred
to
the
fleet
reserve.”
then
they
say
for
the
purposes
of
this,
they
left
them
out
in
19-and-a-half
years
and
one
day.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
possibly
your
honor.
but
i
would
suggest
that
when
they
said
at
least
five
years
of
continuous
active
duty
and
then
they
come
down
and
tell
me
that
for
purposes
of
this
subsection
that
a
part
of
a
year
that’s
six
months
or
more
is
counted
as
a
whole
year,
then
he
has
completed
at
least
five
years
of
active
duty.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
no
your
honor
because
those
people
are
what
we
call
the
20-year
group
and
they
have
been
in
for
20
years
and
are
entitled
to
retire
both
to
promotion
flow
and
other
items
whereas
these
people
are
called-in
in
a
time
of
emergency
such
as
the
vietnam
war.
most
of
these
people
were
draftees
who
came
in
for
an
initial
tour
of
four
years
and
then
they
extended
at
the
requirement
of
the
government
and
then
asked
to
continue
on
and
then
were
involuntarily
retired
when
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
government’s
budgetary
interest
to
reduce
them.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
i
would
have
some
question
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
reserve
officer
for
some
33
years
and
still
one.
i
think
the
congress
is
very
concerned
with
the
very
people
we’re
concerned
with
here.
and
i
would
point
out
one
other
thing
that
in
the
court’s
attempt
in
the
ninth
circuit
to
reach
that
conclusion,
they
may
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
senate
report
involves,
suggested
that
perhaps
there
was
not
subsidy
change
in
that
statute
when
it
was
recodified.
i’d
call
two
things
to
the
court’s
attention,
first,
6330
was
passed
in
1958.
that
was
subsequent
to
the
initial
passage
of
687
(a),
which
was
passed
in
1956.
when
they
recodified
these
matters
in
1962,
some
water
had
gone
under
the
bridge
and
we
believe
that
the
congress
intended
to
do
exactly
what
it
did.
they
don’t
mention
the
house
report.
this
bill
had
to
go
through
both
houses.
it
didn’t
just
go
through
the
senate.
and
the
fact
that
the
senate
said,
“well
we
don’t
think
this
is
any
substantive
change,”
is
really
immaterial
to
the
consideration
of
this
matter
because
when
it
was
passed
by
both
houses,
a
change
did
appear.
and
the
change
is
the
one
that
finds
687
(a)
exactly
as
the
court
of
claims
found
it.
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
language
in
the
court
of
claims
decision
where
they
went
behind
the
statute
and
stated
very
clearly
on
page
three
of
their
opinion
that
although
we
find
the
sections
clear
and
unambiguous
on
its
face
and
its
susceptible
on
its
face
of
only
one
interpretation.
they
then
go
on
to
say
although
we
find
no
ambiguity
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
we’re
not
precluded
from
examining
the
legislative
history
underlying
the
enactment
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
clear
and
compelling
support
for
the
interpretation.
they
then
went
on
to
say
that
after
a
careful
--
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
so
that
after
a
careful
review
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
687
(a),
then
we
can
conclude
that
support
which
it
lends
to
defendants
position,
namely
the
government,
is
not
so
clear
and
compelling
as
to
require
us
to
adopt
an
interpretation
of
the
section
inconsistent
with
a
clear
import
of
its
terms.
and
i
would
like
to
add
one
other
thing
if
i
may
--
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well,
it
would
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
white.
if
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
if
the
man
had
served
four
years,
five
months
and
27
days
in
a
leap
year
february,
well,
he
certainly
would
have
served
less
than
six
months
then
he
would
not
be
eligible.
but
if
he
had
served
four
years,
six
months
and
one
day,
he
would
be
eligible.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
well
again,
i
can
only
state
that
the
court
of
claims
did
review
this
with
great
care
and
they
addressed
that
argument
thoroughly.
i
would
urge
your
honors
to
address
it
carefully
and
i
think
one
of
the
items
that
persuade
it
and
i
was
about
to
call
your
attention
to
this
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
remedial
statute.
and
as
such,
it’s
our
view
that
it
must
be
most
carefully
construed
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
b.
hanson
i’m
not
being
fictitious
when
i
say
this
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
congress
does
many
things
that
i
wonder
about.
but
it’s
my
view
that
there
are
many
statutes
which
they
describe
in
terms
of
this
nature.
they
set
out
what
a
statute
is
and
then
they
put
a
caboose
on
it
so
to
speak
in
which
they
say,
“for
purposes
of
this
section,
we
mean
the
following.”
and
that’s
what
we
say
they’ve
done
here
and
this
isn’t
unusual.
my
time
is
up,
for
that,
i
thank
you.
