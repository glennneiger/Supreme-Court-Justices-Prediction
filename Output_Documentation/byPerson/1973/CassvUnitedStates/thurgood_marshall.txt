the
statutes
were
past
by
both
of
the
departments
as
they
now
exist.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question
as
to
the
--
the
government
asked
congress
to
clarify
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
the
government
told
congress
that
they
made
a
mistake,
has
the
congress
told
them
that
they
misstated
what
they
meant.
has
congress
asked
the
statute
to
be
amended,
has
congress
done
any
of
those
--
i
mean,
has
the
government
done
any
of
those
things
or
do
you
want
us
to
regard
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
is
it
clearly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
want
to
clearly
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
this
is
not
in
the
house.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
all
you’ve
got
is
one
sentence
and
one
report,
which
makes
it
clear?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
make
it
clear.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’ve
taken
on
the
burden
in
showing
that
this
is
clear?
and
i
don’t
think
you
just
needed
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
that
clearly
congress
intended
something
other
than
what
it
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
an
accurate
statement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
that
congress
didn’t
say
what
it
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean
by
inadvertent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
you
say
it’s
clearly,
it
was
inadvertent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
completely
agree
with
you
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you’re
now
telling
me
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
clearly
correct
and
the
court
of
claims
is
clearly
incorrect.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
i
thought,
just
the
middle.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
had
a
little
more
than
one
sentence
in
one
report?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
only
have
one
sentence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
the
bill
as
it
was
written.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
does
that
indicate
that
congress
doesn’t
read
the
bill
before
they
pass
it?
