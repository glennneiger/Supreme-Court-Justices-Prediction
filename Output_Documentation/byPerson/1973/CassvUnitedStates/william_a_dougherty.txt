mr.
william
a.
dougherty
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
might
i
point
out
in
the
beginning
that
our
case
is
slightly
different
than
that
of
cass
because
we
deal
with
three
marine
captain
aviators
and
the
statute,
we
cite
6330
of
title
10,
deals
specifically
with
the
navy
and
the
marine
corps
and
specifically
with
regulars
and
reserves
of
the
navy
in
marine
corps.
as
with
cass,
we
take
the
position
of
course
that
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face.
first,
it
sets
forth
a
standard
and
the
standard
is,
“at
least
five
years
of
continuous
active
duty.”
and
then
with
the
preface,
“for
the
purposes,
i
emphasize,
of
this
subsection,”
it
goes
on
to
define
specifically
what
the
phrase
continuous
active
duty
means
as
was
explained
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
then
it
specifically
defines
the
word
year.
now,
what
the
ninth
circuit
did,
i
submit
is
it
overlooked
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
in
section
2
defining
the
word
year.
and
it
took
the
first
part
of
the
statute,
subsection
(1)
and
then
ignored
(2).
the
statute,
10
u.s.c.
6330
uses
exactly
the
same
phraseology,
the
same
words
as
does
687
(a)
and
specifically
as
i
pointed
out
refers
to
navy
and
marine
personnel
both
regular
and
reserve.
i
would
also
--
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
my
point
is
that
6330
allows
a
six
months
rounding
figure
both
as
to
regulars
and
to
reserves
and
i
think
that’s
significant.
and
since
we
are
dealing
all
our
clients
in
this
case
are
reservists,
i
think
it’s
significant
and
i
was
just
about
if
i
may
call
the
court’s
attention
to
a
statute
that
no
one
has
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
justice
or
the
amicus
curiae
or
anybody.
and
it
is
10
u.s.c.
277.
and
its
states
that
the
laws
applying
to
both
regulars
and
reserves
shall
be
administered
without
discrimination,
(1)
among
regulars;
(2)
among
reserves;
and
(3)
between
regulars
and
reserves.
and
i’m
submitting
that
there's
a
different
treatment
of
reserves
in
6330
than
there
is
in
67
(a)
and
that
contravenes
the
statute
that
i
have
just
cited.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
mr.
chief
justice,
it’s
our
position
that
the
“rounding”
provisions
of
both
statutes
are
exactly
the
same.
the
only
difference
is
the
term
at
least
five
years
as
you
asked
earlier
and
in
reference
to
20
years.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
but
if
you
take
the
subsection
(2)
as
defining
the
word
year,
it
says,
“a
period
of
six
months
or
more”
and
it
says,
“for
purposes
of
this
subsection,”
that
means
the
whole
subsection.
it
just
doesn’t
mean
part
of
it.
and
that’s
the
thing
the
ninth
circuit
missed,
i
submit.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
before
1962?
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
if
you
take
the,
it
was
1016
of
title
50,
that
was
a
different
statute,
yes,
i
agree.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
that
uses
--
that
specifically
used
the
term
for
computation.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
well
only
--
it
depends
where
you
look
sir.
the
senate
says,
mr.
hanson
pointed
out,
the
senate
put
it
--
set
it
at
one
time
but
--
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
well,
mr.
lubenity
(ph),
as
we
pointed
on
our
brief,
mr.
lubenity's
(ph)
original
bill
in
1956
contained
three
things.
it
amended,
it
changed
and
it
codified.
there
were
three
separate
bills,
not
just
one.
that’s
on
page
nine
--
eight
of
our
brief
if
you
please.
they
were
incorporated
as
titles
1,
2
and
3
to
the
bill,
(1)
to
amend
title
10;
(2)
to
codify
recent
military
laws;
and
(3)
to
improve
the
corp.
so
at
best,
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
ambiguous.
thank
you.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
chief
justice,
i’ll
be
brief.
we
submit
that
the
best
refutation
for
the
last
argument
that
all
the
services
administratively
construe
this
the
same
way
is
specious
because
it’s
the
department
of
defense
order
and
it's
axiomatic
that
if
the
department
of
defense
construes
the
statute
one
way,
the
all
four
branches
will
routinely
take
the
order
of
the
department
of
defense.
and
secondly,
we
submit
that
the
government
has
construed
the
statute
or
should
construe
this
statute
in
the
same
way
it
is
construing
6330
as
it
has
done
routinely
in
6330
for
the
last
16
years.
also
--
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
1956
to
1962,
agree.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
it
applied
only
to
--
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
yes.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
yes
sir.
but
if
i
might
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
all
these
other
statutes
that
the
government
has
cited
with
the
exception
of
6330
and
the
coastguard
statute,
42-212
have
nothing
to
do
with
eligibility,
its
all
for
computation.
and
then
these
are
the
only
two
statutes
that
have
anything
to
do
with
eligibility.
and
i
would
--
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
yes,
i
agree
with
that
sir.
but
certainly,
the
tenor
and
the
mood
of
congress
has
certainly
changed
from
1956
to
1962,
the
war
situation
had
changed
--
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
but
the
best
test
of
the
statute
is
the
statute
itself
and
as
mr.
justice
black
used
to
say
when
he
talked
about
the
first
amendment,
if
you
take
this
out
to
the
man
on
the
street
and
put
it
in
front
of
him,
he
is
going
to
say
yes.
the
man
should
get
paid.
six
months
means
what
it
says.[laughter]
but
five
years
your
honor
is
not
--
five
years
is
not
modified
by
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
but
if
--
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
no
but
if
modifying
phrase
for
the
purposes
of
this
subsection
must
mean
what
it
says
that
if
a
man
apart
of
a
year
that
is
six
months
or
more
is
considered
as
a
whole
year.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
they
are
all
worthy
marines
and
then
the
light
of
the
doer.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
dougherty
mr.
chief

may
it

mr.

mr.

that
the
“rounding”

of

mr.
