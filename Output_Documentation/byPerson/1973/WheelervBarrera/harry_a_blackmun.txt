justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petitioners
are
the
state
of
missouri
and
its
state
board
of
education.
the
respondents
are
parents
of
minor
school
children
attending
the
elementary
and
secondary
nonpublic,
that
is
parochial
schools
in
the
core
area
of
kansas
city.
the
case
concerns
title
i
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965
as
amended.
that
act
provides
for
federal
funding
of
special
programs
such
as
remedial
reading
for
educationally
deprived
children
in
both
public
and
private
schools.
the
plaintiffs
who
are
the
respondents
here
by
their
lawsuit
claim
that
the
public
school
authorities
failed
to
provide
adequate
programs
for
private
school
children
as
compared
with
the
programs
for
public
school
children.
the
defendant
petitioners
took
the
position
that
what
the
plaintiffs
were
asking
for,
exceeded
the
requirements
of
the
statute
and
furthermore,
it
violated
the
missouri
constitution
and
missouri
law
on
public
policy.
the
district
court
concluded
that
missouri
had
fulfilled
its
obligation
under
title
i
and
denied
relief
and
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
divided
vote,
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
and
it
comes
to
us
in
that
posture.
congress
by
the
federal
act,
recognized
that
all
children
from
educationally
deprived
areas
do
not
necessarily
attend
the
public
schools
in
that
since
the
legislative
aim
was
to
provide
assistance
to
children
rather
than
to
specific
schools,
it
was
necessary
to
include
eligible
private
school
children
among
the
beneficiaries
of
act.
under
the
federal
plan,
the
act
is
administered
by
local
public
education
officials.
they
formulate
a
plan
that
is
approved
by
the
state
agency
and
then
by
the
united
states
commissioner
of
education.
the
act
requires
that
assistance
to
private
school
students
be
comparable
to
that
provided
for
public
school
children.
the
court
of
appeals
noted
this
comparability
requirement
and
concluded
that
missouri
was
in
violation
of
it
in
meeting
the
argument
that
missouri
law
forbade
sending
private
school
teachers
into
private
schools
--
public
school
teachers
into
private
schools,
the
court
held
that
this
issue
was
to
be
determined
by
federal
rather
than
by
state
law.
and
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
pass
on
the
claim
that
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
would
be
violated
if
title
i
in
fact
required
or
even
permitted
public
school
teachers
to
perform
their
services
on
private
school
premises.
the
court
held
that
since
no
plan
had
yet
been
implemented,
it
must
refrain
from
passing
upon
an
important
constitutional
question
of
that
kind
on
a
hypothetical
basis.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
in
doing
so,
we
are
in
disagreement
with
some
of
the
conclusions
that
that
court
reached.
we
agree
that
on
this
record
and
in
this
stage
of
the
proceedings,
we
cannot
reach
and
decide
whether
title
i
requires
the
assignment
of
teachers
to
provide
remedial
instruction
on
private
school
premises.
the
comparability
requirement
in
any
event
can
be
satisfied
by
other
means.
we
also
conclude
that
the
federal
statute
evinces
a
clear
intention
not
to
avoid
state
constitutional
and
state
law
of
provisions.
in
other
words,
we
conclude
that
state
law
governs.
we
thus
agree
with
the
remand
to
the
district
court
and
we
point
out
a
number
of
avenues
that
are
available
to
the
missouri
authorities
to
comply
with
the
statute.
other
aspects
of
the
case,
we
conclude
are
not
right
for
review
here.
we
emphasize
that
while
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
comparable
services
under
the
statute,
they
are
not
entitled
to
any
particular
form
of
service
and
that
it
is
the
role
of
state
and
local
agencies
and
not
of
the
federal
courts
at
least
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation
to
formulate
an
acceptable
and
legally
suitable
plan.
thus
as
stated
before,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed,
but
with
some
disagreement
on
our
part
as
to
the
reasoning
by
which
the
court
arrived
at
its
result
and
by
a
positive
assertion
on
our
part
that
it
is
missouri
law
and
not
federal
law
which
has
to
govern
on
the
issue
of
the
legal
availability
of
particular
services.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
powell
joins
the
court's
judgment
and
opinion,
but
it
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
statement,
that
mr.
justice
white
concurs
in
the
judgment
and
has
filed
a

that
