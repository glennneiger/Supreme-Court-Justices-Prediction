mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
i’d
like
to
have
a
5-minute
warning.
i’m
reserving
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thirty
minutes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thirty
minutes
because
i’d
like
to
reserve
that
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
brought
by
a
group
of
parents
in
private
church
schools
in
kansas
city
against
the
state
commissioner
of
education
of
missouri
and
the
members
of
the
state
board
of
education,
charging
that
the
plaintiffs
were
deprived
of
their
rights
under
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965.
the
complaint
is
a
rather
broad
ranging
document,
but
as
the
case
progressed,
the
issue
became
quite
narrower.
the
crux
of
the
controversy
revolves
around
a
policy
adopted
by
the
state
of
missouri
that
to
assign
publicly
employed
teachers
to
perform
their
educational
services
in
private
and
specifically
religious
schools,
would
be
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
missouri
and,
that
this
law
was
applicable
to
title
i
teachers
as
well.
the
defense
was
that
the
act
does
not
mandate,
does
not
require
assignment
of
title
i
teachers
to
teach
in
church
schools
and,
if
it
did,
that
to
that
extent
the
act
is
contrary
to
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendants
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
did
not
mandate
such
assignments,
and
stated
further
that
if
it
did,
it
would
raise
grave
constitutional
issues
under
the
establishment
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
two-to-one
with
judge
stevenson’s
dissent
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court.
on
the
basis
of
that
remand,
the
district
court
entered
a
final
judgment,
the
critical
sentence
of
which
is
found
on
page
a46
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
says
defendants
are
enjoined
from
disapproving
any
publication
of
the
local
education
agency
for
the
grant
of
the
federal
title
i
esca
funds
on
the
basis
that
such
publication
includes
the
use
of
title
i
personnel
on
private
school
premises
during
the
regular
school
of
hours.
let’s
say,
unlimited
instruction
that
forbids
refusal
to
approve
any
plan
which
requires
assignment
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
is
--
the
district
court
order,
a
remand,
it’s
called
injunction
and
judgment
issued
in
compliance
with
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it’s
found
on
our
petition
for
certiorari,
page
a45,
but
this
sentence
is
found
on
page
a46,
the
first
paragraph,
which
is
a
critical
issue
before
this
court.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
somewhat
unclear.
and,
judge
stevenson
interpreted
it
to
mean,
as
the
district
court
interpreted
it
to
mean
and
as
the
plaintiffs
interpreted
to
mean,
a
file
conclusive
determination
that
the
state
of
missouri
may
not
refuse,
all
things
being
equal,
may
not
refuse,
to
assign
publicly
employed
teachers
to
teach
in
religious
schools.
now
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
a46.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
a
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor,
i
wouldn’t
burden
this
court
with
an
846
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
[attempt
to
laughter]
particularly
with
the
complaints
of
this
court
that
it’s
overburden
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it’s
the
first
paragraph
on
the
page.
it’s
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph,
before
number
two.
it’s
the
part
--
the
paragraph
would
be
on
our
preceding
page.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
this
is
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
is
the
final
district
court’s
order.
this
injunction
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
plan
hasn’t,
but
no
plan
can’t
--
well,
can’t
happen,
yes.
as
of
now,
yes,
because
of
this
injunction,
because
of
this
injunction.
now,
we
sought
to
get
a
stay
from
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
refused
to
stay
and
we
apply
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
stay.
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
act
until
it
was
ready
for
arguments
here.
but,
as
of
now,
as
of
now
the
situation
is
subject
to
action
by
this
court
that
public
school
teachers,
title
i
teachers,
are
assigned
into
parochial
schools
to
do
exactly
the
same
type
of
teaching
that
the
record
shows
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
that
order,
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
the
order.
we
interpret
the
order
as
an
injunction
forbidding
us,
and
this
is
the
issue
before
the
court,
forbidding
us
to
refuse
to
assign
teachers
to
teach
at
parochial
schools.
this
is
the
injunction
which
is
--
we’re
operating
on.
and,
in
order
to
make
sure
that
this
is
before
the
court,
when
we
filed
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
filed
it
with
a
two-pronged
petition.
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
we
also
had
the
alternative
to
review
the
order
and
judgment
of
the
district
court
ordering
us
not
to
refuse
a
program
for
sending
paroch
--
public
school
teachers
into
parochial
schools.
the
fact
situation
of
this
case,
as
veiled
on
the
trial
and
as
it
developed,
was
just
one
narrow
thing.
we
have
here,
in
missouri
as
in
many
states
that
title
i
program
is
limited
to
teaching,
reading,
and
arithmetic,
occasionally,
some
other
similar
subjects
like
in
summer
schools
shop
or
something,
but
basically,
reading
and
arithmetic.
and,
the
record
shows
what
the
title
i
is.
if
we
look
at
page
43
of
my
brief,
we
find
the
--
a
typical
application,
a
typical
application
for
title
i
fund
by
a
local
agency
which
is
pretty
much
the
same
and
it
gives
a
whole
fact
to
this.
a
reading
specialist
that’s
paragraph
3.
a
reading
specialist
who
assists
classroom
teachers
in
daily
development
reading,
instruction
that
provide
corrective
or
remedial
reading
instruction
of
groups
of
4-10
on
a
regularly
scheduled
basis,
program
reading
text
with
a
variety
of
supplementary
materials
combined
with
pupils’
creative
writing
and
teacher-made
materials
will
be
utilized
to
extent
as
teaching
kit.
this
is
a
typical
thing
which
is
done
in
all
this
schools,
private
and
public
and
this
is
the
crux.
this
is
what
we’re
contending.
we’re
not
required
to
do
under
that
statute
and
if
we
are,
the
statute,
to
that
extent,
violates
the
establishment
clause
and
that
is
a
dual
question
before
this
court.
now,
i'll
address
myself
to
the
statutory
instruction
and
i
think,
statutory
interpretation.
i
think
the
first
thing
to
do,
of
course,
is
to
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
that
is
found
on
page
16
of
my
brief.
it
says
that
a
state
agency
in
--
shall
not
approve
any
of
these
local
agencies
project
unless
it’s
determined,
that
to
the
extent
consistent
with
a
number
of
educationally
deprived
children
in
the
school
district
of
the
local
education
agency,
while
rolled
private
elementary
and
secondary
school,
such
agency
has
made
provision
for
including
special
educational
service
and
arrangements
such
as
dual
enrollment,
educational
radio
and
television
and
mobile
education
services
and
equipment
where
such
children
can
participate.
now,
i
should
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
examples
given
in
the
statute.
the
first
one
which
is
critical,
dual
enrollment;
what
does
dual
enrollment
mean?
it’s
stated
in
the
regulations,
it
explains
what
it
is.
dual
enrollment,
sometimes
called
shared
time
is
when
pupils
in
a
private
school,
registered
in
a
private
school,
go
into
the
public
school
for
some,
but
not
all
of
their
courses.
this
act
provides,
it
is
permissible
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
statute
to
take
pupils
from
the
private
schools
and
bring
them
into
the
public
schools.
clearly,
this
is
just
the
opposite
of
sending
the
school
teacher
into
the
private
school.
so
that,
the
act
on
its
face,
as
giving
an
example,
this
is
not
the
only
sin
committed,
there
are
just
such
acts,
as
one
example
of
what
is
permissible
which
would
meet
the
requirement
of
the
act,
is
to
send
the
children
into
the
public
school
rather
than
the
sending
of
the
public
school
teacher
into
the
private
school.
so
that,
it
is
clear
without
further
that
the
statute
does
not
mandate,
but
apparently,
the
court
of
appeals
mandates
and
the
district
court
mandates,
you
must
send
them
into
the
parochial
school
if
you
sent
them
into
the
public
school.
secondly,
the
situation
in
missouri,
where
the
law
is
interpreted
by
the
state
board
of
education
is
not
to
permit
this,
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
hew
very
early
in
the
letter
specifically
addressed
to
this
problem,
sent
to
the
assistant
commissioner
of
education
that
we
have
the
response
of
the
commissioner
of
education
on
page
19
and
20
which,
in
the
light,
this
is
in
1967,
in
the
light
of
the
specific
missouri
situation
said
“no,
it’s
not
required.”
the
statute
does
not
mandate
any
particular
form
so
long
as
you
provide
services
for
the
students.
then,
we
have
another,
there
are
many
more,
but
another
indicia,
in
the
handbook
of
the
hew
or
commissioner
of
education,
which
again
recognizes,
and
i
call
this
court’s
attention
to
that
paragraph
which
i’ve
quoted
on
page
22
of
our
brief
in
which
refers
again
to
the
situation,
it’s
called
logistics
on
page
22.
it
says
not
the
least
of
difficulties
in
including
private
school
children
in
title
i
activities,
are
the
problem,
schedule,
transportation,
hiring
and
assignment
of
personnel,
purchasing
inventory
equipment,
and
arrangements
for
space.
then,
in
those
states
in
which
public
school
personnel
may
not
perform
service
on
private
premises,
the
difficulties
are
compounded.
then
it
says
no
easy
solution
to
the
logistical
problems.
if
they
do
their
best,
with
good
faith,
you
can
get
it.
but
this,
again,
is
a
recognition
that
there
is
a
problem,
and
a
logistical
problem.
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
that
you
must
send
them
in,
then
there’s
no
problem.
the
answer
is
there’s
no
problem
because
you
have
to
send
them
in.
finally,
and
there’s
more
in
my
brief
and
i
don’t
want
to
extend
too
much
on
it,
but
finally,
i
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
something
which
appears
in
the
government’s
brief,
on
page
19
of
the
government's
brief,
in
which
a
house
committee
--
this
is
after
the
act
was
in
operation
for
a
year.
on
page
19,
the
paragraph
at
the
beginning
of
page
18,
but
the
critical
part
of
it
is
that
the
state
boards
are
given
wide
discretion
to
the
form
of
program
they
will
approve
and
the
--
towards
the
end,
in
order
to
assure
that
such
programs
and
project
could
operate
as
part
of
the
public
school
system
in
conformance
with
local
and
state
legal
and
constitutional
requirements.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
i
don’t
believe
the
court
of
appeals
found
it.
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
as
the
court
of
appeals
have
previously
found
in
the
earliest
--
earlier
proceeding
where
the
district
court
had
sought
dismissal
of
complaint
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
an
unresolved
question
of
state
law.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
saying
it’s
not
--
it’s
irrelevant
what
the
state
law
is.
the
question
is
what
the
federal
law
is.
the
thrust,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
state
law
is
irrelevant.
this
is
a
federal
law
and,
therefore,
it
is
to
be
interpreted
and
applied
according
to
federal
statutes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
--
my
only
response
to
that
is
that
accomplishes
what?
the
district
court
so
interpreted
and
i
think
judge
stevens
so
interpreted,
and
it
is
the
only
--
and,
independent
of
that,
i
address
that
for
court,
independent
of
that,
the
legislative
history
and
the
constructive
interpretation
by
hew
over
the
years
is
that
it
is
not
the
state
attorney
general
who
gives
an
advisory
opinion
would
determine
state
law,
but
that
under
the
the
sea,
the
responsibility
for
interpreting
and
applying
the
act,
and
that’s
cited
in
the
brief,
rests
with
the
state
education
agency
and
it
is
not,
indeed
as
i’ve
indicated,
from
the
fact
that
while
the
congress
was
in
session
it
had
this
situation
in
missouri
in
mind,
and
the
commission
of
education
responding
to
senator
long
then
said
“we
know
that
missouri
law
doesn’t
forbid
it.”
all
the
hew’s
writings,
including
the
--
it’s
program
file
and
all
things
are
recognized
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
if
that
were
the
case,
if
that
were
the
case
it
would
be
that
i
think
--
i
don’t
think
we
would
have
a
case
because
we
believe
this
is
not
all
the
discretion
which
the
state
board
of
education
has,
that
it
has
other
discretions
as
well.
but
it
seems
to
me
and
it
seems
to
everybody,
that
this
decision
did
not
go
on
the
fact
that
the
state
board
of
education
was
unable
to
interpret
its
own
law.
the
supreme
court
decision
of
the
state
of
missouri
was
interpreted
one
way
by
a
state
board
of
education
and
another
way
by
the
state
attorney
general.
we,
initially,
had
the
same
--
took
the
same
position
which
you
took,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
asked
that
the
district
court
abstain
until
the
state
missouri
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
missouri
resolved
that
question.
the
district
court
said
“no,
because
that’s
irrelevant.”
what
the
state
does
is
irrelevant.
this
is
a
federal
law
dealing
with
federal
funds
and,
therefore,
it’s
to
be
applied
by
federal
law.
that’s
why
we’re
here.
we
want
the
--
if
we
would
have
been
directed
and
indeed
the
plaintiffs
still
have
the
option
of
the
mandamus
in
the
state
courts.
now,
so
much
for
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i
am
trying
to
point
out
in
this,
this
is
an
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and,
the
administrative
interpretation
says
there
are
logistic
problems
in
various
things.
one
of
the
logistic
problems
arises
when
state
law
forbids
to
assign
public
personnel
to
private
schools.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
that
state
law
is
irrelevant,
then
the
hew
would
have
said
there’s
no
logistic
problem.
simply,
the
law
requires
that
whatever
the
state
law
is,
the
federal
statute,
that
you
must
decide
to
serve
in
private
schools.
then
no
logistics
at
all,
the
fact
that
they
said
in
the
second
paragraph
that
there
are
no
easy
solutions,
and
however,
when
the
leader
solution
allows
several
options,
then
good
faith
will
work
something
up.
but,
this
is
a
recognition
by
hew
that
you
are
not
mandated
to
send
public
school
teachers
into
the
private
school
even
to
avoid
logistic
problems.
i
would
like
to
devote
the
rest
of
my
time
here
up
to
the
amount
i’m
reserving,
except
for
that
i’m
reserving
for
rebuttal,
to
the
constitutional
issue.
in
the
event
we
are
incorrect,
in
the
event
that
this
court
decides
that
where
certain
services
are
provided
for
educational
services
by
title
i
teachers,
the
title
i
teachers
must
go
into
the
church
schools
to
perform
those
services.
we
would
suggest
that,
to
that
extent,
the
statute
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
now
in
saying
that,
it’s
important
to
know
that
the
issue
before
this
court
in
this
case
it's
quite
narrow,
we
are
not
challenging
other
title
i
services
which
are
permitted
under
the
statute,
including
those
specifically
stated
in
the
statute
as
mobile
equipment,
nor
those
which
hew
has,
in
its
interpretation
of
the
application
of
the
law,
held
to
be
permissible
such
as
breakfasts
or
medical
care.
we
do
not
challenge
sending
the
doctor
in
or
a
hot
breakfast
with
cooks
to
prepare
it.
we
are
challenging
only
about
the
basic.
and,
the
record
shows
basically
the
same
type
of
teaching
of
regular
subjects,
most
prominently
reading
and
arithmetic,
which
goes
into
the
public
schools
except
what?
except
smaller
classes
and
specially
trained
or
teachers
given
a
special
additional
training
of
task
force
how
to
handle
students
who
are
below
the
norm.
and
that,
too,
appears
in
the
typical
application.
again,
i
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
page
43
of
my
brief
which
is
typical
application,
item
four,
degree
of
education
deprivation
necessary
for
participation.
below
norm
on
standardized
test
by
three
months
for
primary
school,
six
months
for
intermediate,
nine
months
for
grade
seven,
if
a
student
is
below
those
norms,
he
is
put
into
a
smaller
class,
and
that’s
indicated,
and
he’s
given
a
teacher
and
the
teachers
will
be
given
a
crash
course
under
hew
sponsorship
on
how
to
handle
that
case.
now,
these
students
who
are
below
norm
are
not
students
who
are,
psychologically,
problems.
they
are
ordinary
students
who
for
variety
reasons.
the
best
example
is
the
one
which
the
court
of
appeals
gave
in
its
opinion
on
page
--
which
i
cite
on
page
a45,
footnote
13
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
a45,
no,
a15,
i’m
sorry,
a15
on
the
footnote.
it
says
the
record
discloses
that
our
lady
of
the
american
school,
a
parochial
school
in
kansas
city,
has
a
student
body
that
is
98%
excellent
with
approximately
175
students
eligible
for
title
i.
children
are
confronted
with
a
language
and
cultural
problem.
now,
that’s
all
i
want
to
read
from
the
brief.
what
do
we
have?
we
have
students
who,
because
they’re
foreign-born,
are
slower
than
the
average.
but,
the
instruction
given
is
basically
the
same
thing
as
the
instructions
given
in
other
students.
now,
it’s
our
contention
that
in
that
context
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
lemon
against
kurtzman,
earley
against
dicenso,
and
sanders
against
johnson,
where
this
court
said
you
cannot
finance
a
secular
instruction
in
church
schools.
what
is
the
difference?
the
education
is
basically
the
same,
ordinary
secular
education
and
even
in
the
lemon
against
kurtzman,
they
chose
these
secular
courses.
what
is
the
only
difference?
the
only
difference
between
this
situation
and
the
lemon,
dicenso,
johnson
cases
is
that,
in
this
situation
the
teachers
are
paid
directly
and
hired
directly
by
the
public
agency.
in
the
other
cases,
the
teachers
are
hired
originally
by
the
parochial
schools
but
paid
in
whole
and
part
out
of
public
funds.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
we
don’t
think
it’s
a
critical
difference.
we
say
this
because
of
a
number
of
reasons.
we
say
that
in
sum
that
the
potential
for
comfort,
and
i’m
reading
now
from
the
levitt
decision
which
this
court
decided
last
year
and
quoting
from
the
lemon
decision,
“the
potential
for
conflict
in
here,
in
this
situation,
just
as
it
did
in
the
levitt
and
the
dicenso,
lemon
case.
we
show,
we
argue,
and
we
show
from
the
record
that,
as
it
operates,
it
is
perfectly
permissible,
for
example,
it
is
perfectly
permissible
for
the
parochial
school
to
take
one
of
its
teachers
or
more,
divorce
them,
sever
them
from
the
payroll
and
assign
them
as
a
title
i
teacher.
they
get
special
training
and
they
come
back
only
to
stay
in
the
same
schools.
they
have
now
been
transferred
simply
from
one
payroll
to
another.
they
do
the
same
thing
except
they
are
now
under
public
payroll.
moreover,
and
this
is
the
--
and
this
is
interesting
that
they
may
even
be
employed
simultaneously
by
both.
if
you
--
and
the
regulations
which
i
quote
on
page
5
of
my
brief,
page
5
in
the
brief
says
as
follows:
provisions
for
section
--
this
is
from
the
regulations
cfr
section
116,
“provision
for
special
education
services
for
educationally
deprived
children
enrolled
in
private
schools
shall
not
include
the
paying
of
salaries
for
teachers
or
other
employees
of
private
schools.”
now,
the
next
is
critical,
“except
for
services
performed
outside
their
regular
hours
of
duty
and
under
public
supervision
and
control.”
in
other
words,
what
this
allows
is
for
a
parochial
school
teacher
to
teach
under
the
payroll
of
the
parochial
school
for
part
time
and
under
the
payroll
of
the
title
i,
the
other
part
of
the
title,
so
long
as
it
is
beyond
the
regular
hours
of
the
parochial
school
teacher
and
a
parochial
school
teacher
can
be
hired
from
9-3
or
from
9-1
or
9-12.
moreover,
the
--
while
you’re
looking,
you
have
the
severe
problem
of
the
fact
that
a
church
school
is
a
church
school
and
it
doesn’t
become
something
else
when
a
public
school,
publicly
employed
teacher
enters.
that
is
why
the
courts
which
have
been
faced
with
this
issue,
with
respect
to
state
law,
and
the
district
court
in
the
case
which
i
cite,
(inaudible)
against
oaktree,
the
district
court
in
the
first
circuit
said
--
which
involved
a
state
statute,
a
state
statute
which
says
that
public
school,
publicly
appointed
teachers
out
of
state
funds
may
teach
in
parochial
schools,
they
declared
not
unconstitutional
and,
i
commend
to
this
court,
the
court’s
opinion,
there
was
a
thorough
discussion
of
it
indicating
that
the
potential
for
--
the
law
of
the
constitution,
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
in
nyquist,
in
levitt,
in
lemon,
dicenso,
and
each
of
the
cases
said
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this
it
is
an
obligation
to
make
certain,
to
make
certain
that
the
publicly
employed
teacher
does
not
use
his
position
for
the
advancement
of
religion.
the
--
this
court
said
in
nyquist,
and
i
quote
it
on
page
30
referring
to
the
dicenso
case,
about
page
30,
the
role
on
legislature
has
not
and
could
not
provide
state
aid
on
the
basis
of
a
mere
assumption
that
secular
teachers
under
religious
discipline
can
avoid
conflicts.
the
state
and
this
is
emphasized,
the
emphasis
is
not
mine,
the
emphasis
of
this
court
in
a
nyquist
case
referring
to
the
dicenso
case,
the
state
must
be
certain,
given
the
religious
cause,
that
subsidized
teachers
do
not
inculcate
religion.
and
the
court
found
there,
in
both,
nyquist,
levitt,
dicenso,
lemon,
that
there
was
no
such
certainty.
there
is
no
such
certainty
in
this
case.
all
there
is,
is
a
statement
in
the
rule,
in
the
regulations
that
the
title
i
teachers
may
not
teach
religion.
but,
that
alone
--
that
was
also
the
case
in
each
one
of
these
cases.
all
the
state
statutes
struck
down
in
dicenso,
in
levitt,
in
lemon,
in
johnson.
all
those
had
the
same
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
sanction
was
there,
that
the
funds
could
be
and
would
be
turned
off.
and,
those
funds
went
to
the
teacher
himself.
there
was
a
clear
sanction
because
--
for
example,
in
dicenso
the
record
showed
that
a
teacher
who
wanted
to
get
public
funds
had
to
take
--
write
a
written
promise
of
kind
that
he
or
she
would
not
teach
any
religion
and
that
violation
of
that
meant,
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
dismissal
to
the
extent
of
being
paid
out
of
public
funds.
finally
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
alright,
thank
you.
now,
finally,
the
--
this
court
in
walz,
the
tax
exemption
case,
and
then
the
subsequent
cases
added
a
new
dimension
to
the
test
for
impermissibility
under
the
establishment
clause.
previously,
on
the
exempt
case,
it
was
a
forbidding
of
any
law
which
either
has
as
its
purpose
the
advancement
of
religion
whose
primary
effect
is
the
advancement
of
religion.
and,
we
do
not
assert
here
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
advance
religion,
we
say
its
effect
is.
but,
in
walz
and
then
in
lemon
cases,
this
court
added
intervention,
that
even
if
those
two
qualifications
was
satisfied,
if
the
result
of
the
law
is
entanglement
of
church
and
state,
that
too
is
unconstitutional.
it
was
a
new
dimension,
but
goes
back,
way
back
at
least
as
far
as
the
cases
in
which
the
court
said
it
could
not
intervene
and
try
church
disputes
going
back
to
the
civil
war
period.
but
this
entanglement,
which
is
one
of
the
foundations
of
the
statute,
is
inevitable
in
this
situation.
you
must,
in
order
to
assure
that
teachers
who
work
in
a
church
school
on
at
least
partially
the
supervision,
and
the
regulation
shows
that,
under
partial
supervision
of
the
school
authorities
do
not,
because
of
their
religious
commitment,
use
their
office
to
advance
religion.
it
must
be
put
under
continual
surveillance.
it
must
be
subject
to
continual
policing.
this
surveillance
is
exactly
what
the
court
tells,
forbid
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
take
exception
to
the
last
statement
made
by
mr.
friedman.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
mandate
of
the
district
court
that’s
clear
and
ambiguous
and
leaves
no
options.
it
says
the
defendant
is
enjoined
from
disapproving
any
application
of
the
local
educational
agency
on
the
basis
that
such
application
includes
the
use
of
title
i
personnel
in
private
school
premises
during
regular
school
hours.
there’s
no
way
of
interpreting
this
to
allow
shared
time.
shared
time
and,
certainly,
dual
enrollment
is
not
within
this.
it’s
not
use
of
time
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
therefore,
it
would
have
to
be
rejected.
it
would
have
to
be
rejected
because
we
are
enjoined,
we
are
enjoined
from
doing
anything,
but
sending
public
school
teachers
into
private
schools
during
school
others.
if
we
have
anything
else,
this
is
the
--
we
are
enjoined
from
doing
that.
now,
one
other
point
i
want
to
make
with
respect
to
that.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
do
not
concede
that
the
only
permissible
alternatives
under
the
act
are
dual
enrollment
and
sending
teachers
in.
we
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
statute
--
the
language
of
the
statute
which
is
on
page
3
of
our
brief
which
says
the
term
--
i’d
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
from
the
page,
such
page
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
page
3
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
justice
brennan.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i’m
sorry,
page
3
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
petition
for
certiorari,
yes
sir.
it
says,
dealing
with
private
schools,
“such
as
dual
enrollment,
educational
radio
and
television
and
mobile
education
service
and
equipment.”
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
statute
does
not
limit
and
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
the
only
alternatives
open
to
a
state
are
either
sending
the
public
school
teacher
in
or
dual
enrollment.
the
“such
as”
indicates
that
these
are
illustrative,
are
things
which
are
permissible.
another
point
i
shall
like
to
make,
and
this
is
in
response
to
a
statement
made
by
mr.
sullivan
in
response
to
a
question
by
a
member
of
the
court,
that
if
the
state
of
missouri
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
missouri
had
ruled,
for
example,
that
dual
enrollment
under
title
i
is
not
inconsistent
with
state
law,
the
state
board
of
education
takes
a
position
that
it
could
ignore
it
and
deem
itself
to
be
the
only
judge,
i
think
that,
obviously,
it’s
not
such.
of
course,
we
are
a
state
agency,
we
are
subject
to
the
judgments
of
a
state
supreme
court,
and
indeed,
our
position
is
based
upon
our
interpretation
of
a
state
supreme
court
decision.
if
the
state
supreme
court
says
to
us
it
is
not
a
violation
of
state
law
to
do
your
dual
enrollment
or
sending
type
i
teachers
in,
we’re
bound
by
that,
if
not,
there’ll
be
a
judgment
of
contempt
against
us.
we
say
only
that
in
between,
in
respect,
the
relationship,
the
inter-government
relationship
between
the
state
of
missouri
and
the
united
states
office
of
education
that
the
initial
responsibility
of
determining
the
state
law
rests
with
the
state
board
of
education.
now,
this
leads
us
to
another
point
in
respect
with
the
abstention.
in
the
district
court,
when
the
case
first
came
up,
we
did
not
initially
ask
for
abstention.
the
reason
for
that
was
that
we
took
the
position
that
state
law
was
clear
in
that
our
responsibility
under
state
law
was
clear
that
there
was
no
question
of
state
law
as
far
as
the
federal
district
was
concerned.
the
question
was
the
state
of
missouri,
speaking
through
its
state
board
of
education,
ruled
that
this
was
not
permissible.
then,
the
court
of
its
own
raised
it
and
we
then
replied
that
if
this
court
deems
that
this
is
relevant,
then
it
should
abstain
and
we
so
argued
it,
that
it's
abstained
until
a
state
court
decision
could
be
reached,
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
state
law
is
irrelevant.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
district
court
initially
abstained.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
then
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
it
and
said
that
state
law
is
irrelevant.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
it’s
a
federal
law
and,
therefore
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
that’s
in
the
--
that’s
referred
to.
that’
initial.
then,
we
sent
it
back
and
we
had
a
trial.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
our
view
initially
that
state
law
is
irrelevant
in
the
sense
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
state
law
--
then
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
would
be,
and
i
think
there’s
a
procedure
where
you
--
that
the
state
law
question
could
be
satisfied
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri,
assuming
that
that
is
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
you
could
do
that
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
justice
brennan,
although
--
you
could
do
that,
but
our
contention
of
course,
our
second
condition
is
that
even
if
state
law
is
not
violated
that
this
does
violate
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
the
establishment
clause.
so,
that
in
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
assume
so.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
assume
so.
the
--
i
think
that
would
be
correct,
but
we
would
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
only
thing
i
answer,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
except
for
the
original
argument,
we
could
not
convince
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
could
only
say
--
are
you
asking
my
opinion
or
the
opinion
of
the
state
board
of
education?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
state
board
of
education
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
our
position
is
that
state
law
is
that
dual
enrollment
and
sending
teachers
into
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
both
are
equally
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
both
equally
forbidden
by
the
state
constitution
of
missouri.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
that’s
true,
but
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
it’s
contrary
to
state
law
whether
it’s
--
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
exactly,
and
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
my
ultimate
position
is
that,
as
we
interpret
the
federal
statute,
the
federal
statute
requires
accommodation
to
state
law,
constitutional,
statutory,
and
decision.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
therefore,
it’s
the
whole
conglomeration,
not
merely
one
aspect
of
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
in
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
in
a
sense.
yes,
the
only
thing
i
can
also
answer
is,
as
i
interpret
it,
i
would
--
as
i
interpret
the
statute,
and
i
miss
in
there,
those
are
not
the
only
two
alternatives
permitted.
dual
enrollment
and
sending
in,
these
are
possible.
there
are
a
variety
of
alternatives.
we
have
been
foreclosed
by
the
decision
of
the
district
court
to
use
one
option.
the
option
which
we
want,
which
we
believe
is
the
best
option.
we’ve
been
foreclosed.
we've
been
foreclosed;
we
believe
it’s
violation
our
state
law,
our
state
constitution
to
send
public
school
teachers
in.
we’ve
been
told
to
forget
that.
you
cannot
use
that
as
criteria.
you’re
enjoined
from
it.
if
we
use
it,
we’re
under
contempt.
this
is
the
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
i’d
like
to
have
a
5-minute
warning.
i’m
reserving
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thirty
minutes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thirty
minutes
because
i’d
like
to
reserve
that
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
brought
by
a
group
of
parents
in
private
church
schools
in
kansas
city
against
the
state
commissioner
of
education
of
missouri
and
the
members
of
the
state
board
of
education,
charging
that
the
plaintiffs
were
deprived
of
their
rights
under
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965.
the
complaint
is
a
rather
broad
ranging
document,
but
as
the
case
progressed,
the
issue
became
quite
narrower.
the
crux
of
the
controversy
revolves
around
a
policy
adopted
by
the
state
of
missouri
that
to
assign
publicly
employed
teachers
to
perform
their
educational
services
in
private
and
specifically
religious
schools,
would
be
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
missouri
and,
that
this
law
was
applicable
to
title
i
teachers
as
well.
the
defense
was
that
the
act
does
not
mandate,
does
not
require
assignment
of
title
i
teachers
to
teach
in
church
schools
and,
if
it
did,
that
to
that
extent
the
act
is
contrary
to
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendants
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
did
not
mandate
such
assignments,
and
stated
further
that
if
it
did,
it
would
raise
grave
constitutional
issues
under
the
establishment
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
two-to-one
with
judge
stevenson’s
dissent
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court.
on
the
basis
of
that
remand,
the
district
court
entered
a
final
judgment,
the
critical
sentence
of
which
is
found
on
page
a46
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
says
defendants
are
enjoined
from
disapproving
any
publication
of
the
local
education
agency
for
the
grant
of
the
federal
title
i
esca
funds
on
the
basis
that
such
publication
includes
the
use
of
title
i
personnel
on
private
school
premises
during
the
regular
school
of
hours.
let’s
say,
unlimited
instruction
that
forbids
refusal
to
approve
any
plan
which
requires
assignment
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
is
--
the
district
court
order,
a
remand,
it’s
called
injunction
and
judgment
issued
in
compliance
with
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it’s
found
on
our
petition
for
certiorari,
page
a45,
but
this
sentence
is
found
on
page
a46,
the
first
paragraph,
which
is
a
critical
issue
before
this
court.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
somewhat
unclear.
and,
judge
stevenson
interpreted
it
to
mean,
as
the
district
court
interpreted
it
to
mean
and
as
the
plaintiffs
interpreted
to
mean,
a
file
conclusive
determination
that
the
state
of
missouri
may
not
refuse,
all
things
being
equal,
may
not
refuse,
to
assign
publicly
employed
teachers
to
teach
in
religious
schools.
now
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
a46.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
a
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor,
i
wouldn’t
burden
this
court
with
an
846
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
[attempt
to
laughter]
particularly
with
the
complaints
of
this
court
that
it’s
overburden
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it’s
the
first
paragraph
on
the
page.
it’s
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph,
before
number
two.
it’s
the
part
--
the
paragraph
would
be
on
our
preceding
page.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
this
is
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
is
the
final
district
court’s
order.
this
injunction
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
plan
hasn’t,
but
no
plan
can’t
--
well,
can’t
happen,
yes.
as
of
now,
yes,
because
of
this
injunction,
because
of
this
injunction.
now,
we
sought
to
get
a
stay
from
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
refused
to
stay
and
we
apply
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
stay.
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
act
until
it
was
ready
for
arguments
here.
but,
as
of
now,
as
of
now
the
situation
is
subject
to
action
by
this
court
that
public
school
teachers,
title
i
teachers,
are
assigned
into
parochial
schools
to
do
exactly
the
same
type
of
teaching
that
the
record
shows
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
that
order,
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
the
order.
we
interpret
the
order
as
an
injunction
forbidding
us,
and
this
is
the
issue
before
the
court,
forbidding
us
to
refuse
to
assign
teachers
to
teach
at
parochial
schools.
this
is
the
injunction
which
is
--
we’re
operating
on.
and,
in
order
to
make
sure
that
this
is
before
the
court,
when
we
filed
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
filed
it
with
a
two-pronged
petition.
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
we
also
had
the
alternative
to
review
the
order
and
judgment
of
the
district
court
ordering
us
not
to
refuse
a
program
for
sending
paroch
--
public
school
teachers
into
parochial
schools.
the
fact
situation
of
this
case,
as
veiled
on
the
trial
and
as
it
developed,
was
just
one
narrow
thing.
we
have
here,
in
missouri
as
in
many
states
that
title
i
program
is
limited
to
teaching,
reading,
and
arithmetic,
occasionally,
some
other
similar
subjects
like
in
summer
schools
shop
or
something,
but
basically,
reading
and
arithmetic.
and,
the
record
shows
what
the
title
i
is.
if
we
look
at
page
43
of
my
brief,
we
find
the
--
a
typical
application,
a
typical
application
for
title
i
fund
by
a
local
agency
which
is
pretty
much
the
same
and
it
gives
a
whole
fact
to
this.
a
reading
specialist
that’s
paragraph
3.
a
reading
specialist
who
assists
classroom
teachers
in
daily
development
reading,
instruction
that
provide
corrective
or
remedial
reading
instruction
of
groups
of
4-10
on
a
regularly
scheduled
basis,
program
reading
text
with
a
variety
of
supplementary
materials
combined
with
pupils’
creative
writing
and
teacher-made
materials
will
be
utilized
to
extent
as
teaching
kit.
this
is
a
typical
thing
which
is
done
in
all
this
schools,
private
and
public
and
this
is
the
crux.
this
is
what
we’re
contending.
we’re
not
required
to
do
under
that
statute
and
if
we
are,
the
statute,
to
that
extent,
violates
the
establishment
clause
and
that
is
a
dual
question
before
this
court.
now,
i'll
address
myself
to
the
statutory
instruction
and
i
think,
statutory
interpretation.
i
think
the
first
thing
to
do,
of
course,
is
to
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
that
is
found
on
page
16
of
my
brief.
it
says
that
a
state
agency
in
--
shall
not
approve
any
of
these
local
agencies
project
unless
it’s
determined,
that
to
the
extent
consistent
with
a
number
of
educationally
deprived
children
in
the
school
district
of
the
local
education
agency,
while
rolled
private
elementary
and
secondary
school,
such
agency
has
made
provision
for
including
special
educational
service
and
arrangements
such
as
dual
enrollment,
educational
radio
and
television
and
mobile
education
services
and
equipment
where
such
children
can
participate.
now,
i
should
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
examples
given
in
the
statute.
the
first
one
which
is
critical,
dual
enrollment;
what
does
dual
enrollment
mean?
it’s
stated
in
the
regulations,
it
explains
what
it
is.
dual
enrollment,
sometimes
called
shared
time
is
when
pupils
in
a
private
school,
registered
in
a
private
school,
go
into
the
public
school
for
some,
but
not
all
of
their
courses.
this
act
provides,
it
is
permissible
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
statute
to
take
pupils
from
the
private
schools
and
bring
them
into
the
public
schools.
clearly,
this
is
just
the
opposite
of
sending
the
school
teacher
into
the
private
school.
so
that,
the
act
on
its
face,
as
giving
an
example,
this
is
not
the
only
sin
committed,
there
are
just
such
acts,
as
one
example
of
what
is
permissible
which
would
meet
the
requirement
of
the
act,
is
to
send
the
children
into
the
public
school
rather
than
the
sending
of
the
public
school
teacher
into
the
private
school.
so
that,
it
is
clear
without
further
that
the
statute
does
not
mandate,
but
apparently,
the
court
of
appeals
mandates
and
the
district
court
mandates,
you
must
send
them
into
the
parochial
school
if
you
sent
them
into
the
public
school.
secondly,
the
situation
in
missouri,
where
the
law
is
interpreted
by
the
state
board
of
education
is
not
to
permit
this,
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
hew
very
early
in
the
letter
specifically
addressed
to
this
problem,
sent
to
the
assistant
commissioner
of
education
that
we
have
the
response
of
the
commissioner
of
education
on
page
19
and
20
which,
in
the
light,
this
is
in
1967,
in
the
light
of
the
specific
missouri
situation
said
“no,
it’s
not
required.”
the
statute
does
not
mandate
any
particular
form
so
long
as
you
provide
services
for
the
students.
then,
we
have
another,
there
are
many
more,
but
another
indicia,
in
the
handbook
of
the
hew
or
commissioner
of
education,
which
again
recognizes,
and
i
call
this
court’s
attention
to
that
paragraph
which
i’ve
quoted
on
page
22
of
our
brief
in
which
refers
again
to
the
situation,
it’s
called
logistics
on
page
22.
it
says
not
the
least
of
difficulties
in
including
private
school
children
in
title
i
activities,
are
the
problem,
schedule,
transportation,
hiring
and
assignment
of
personnel,
purchasing
inventory
equipment,
and
arrangements
for
space.
then,
in
those
states
in
which
public
school
personnel
may
not
perform
service
on
private
premises,
the
difficulties
are
compounded.
then
it
says
no
easy
solution
to
the
logistical
problems.
if
they
do
their
best,
with
good
faith,
you
can
get
it.
but
this,
again,
is
a
recognition
that
there
is
a
problem,
and
a
logistical
problem.
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
that
you
must
send
them
in,
then
there’s
no
problem.
the
answer
is
there’s
no
problem
because
you
have
to
send
them
in.
finally,
and
there’s
more
in
my
brief
and
i
don’t
want
to
extend
too
much
on
it,
but
finally,
i
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
something
which
appears
in
the
government’s
brief,
on
page
19
of
the
government's
brief,
in
which
a
house
committee
--
this
is
after
the
act
was
in
operation
for
a
year.
on
page
19,
the
paragraph
at
the
beginning
of
page
18,
but
the
critical
part
of
it
is
that
the
state
boards
are
given
wide
discretion
to
the
form
of
program
they
will
approve
and
the
--
towards
the
end,
in
order
to
assure
that
such
programs
and
project
could
operate
as
part
of
the
public
school
system
in
conformance
with
local
and
state
legal
and
constitutional
requirements.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
i
don’t
believe
the
court
of
appeals
found
it.
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
as
the
court
of
appeals
have
previously
found
in
the
earliest
--
earlier
proceeding
where
the
district
court
had
sought
dismissal
of
complaint
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
an
unresolved
question
of
state
law.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
saying
it’s
not
--
it’s
irrelevant
what
the
state
law
is.
the
question
is
what
the
federal
law
is.
the
thrust,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
state
law
is
irrelevant.
this
is
a
federal
law
and,
therefore,
it
is
to
be
interpreted
and
applied
according
to
federal
statutes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
--
my
only
response
to
that
is
that
accomplishes
what?
the
district
court
so
interpreted
and
i
think
judge
stevens
so
interpreted,
and
it
is
the
only
--
and,
independent
of
that,
i
address
that
for
court,
independent
of
that,
the
legislative
history
and
the
constructive
interpretation
by
hew
over
the
years
is
that
it
is
not
the
state
attorney
general
who
gives
an
advisory
opinion
would
determine
state
law,
but
that
under
the
the
sea,
the
responsibility
for
interpreting
and
applying
the
act,
and
that’s
cited
in
the
brief,
rests
with
the
state
education
agency
and
it
is
not,
indeed
as
i’ve
indicated,
from
the
fact
that
while
the
congress
was
in
session
it
had
this
situation
in
missouri
in
mind,
and
the
commission
of
education
responding
to
senator
long
then
said
“we
know
that
missouri
law
doesn’t
forbid
it.”
all
the
hew’s
writings,
including
the
--
it’s
program
file
and
all
things
are
recognized
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
if
that
were
the
case,
if
that
were
the
case
it
would
be
that
i
think
--
i
don’t
think
we
would
have
a
case
because
we
believe
this
is
not
all
the
discretion
which
the
state
board
of
education
has,
that
it
has
other
discretions
as
well.
but
it
seems
to
me
and
it
seems
to
everybody,
that
this
decision
did
not
go
on
the
fact
that
the
state
board
of
education
was
unable
to
interpret
its
own
law.
the
supreme
court
decision
of
the
state
of
missouri
was
interpreted
one
way
by
a
state
board
of
education
and
another
way
by
the
state
attorney
general.
we,
initially,
had
the
same
--
took
the
same
position
which
you
took,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
asked
that
the
district
court
abstain
until
the
state
missouri
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
missouri
resolved
that
question.
the
district
court
said
“no,
because
that’s
irrelevant.”
what
the
state
does
is
irrelevant.
this
is
a
federal
law
dealing
with
federal
funds
and,
therefore,
it’s
to
be
applied
by
federal
law.
that’s
why
we’re
here.
we
want
the
--
if
we
would
have
been
directed
and
indeed
the
plaintiffs
still
have
the
option
of
the
mandamus
in
the
state
courts.
now,
so
much
for
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i
am
trying
to
point
out
in
this,
this
is
an
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and,
the
administrative
interpretation
says
there
are
logistic
problems
in
various
things.
one
of
the
logistic
problems
arises
when
state
law
forbids
to
assign
public
personnel
to
private
schools.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
that
state
law
is
irrelevant,
then
the
hew
would
have
said
there’s
no
logistic
problem.
simply,
the
law
requires
that
whatever
the
state
law
is,
the
federal
statute,
that
you
must
decide
to
serve
in
private
schools.
then
no
logistics
at
all,
the
fact
that
they
said
in
the
second
paragraph
that
there
are
no
easy
solutions,
and
however,
when
the
leader
solution
allows
several
options,
then
good
faith
will
work
something
up.
but,
this
is
a
recognition
by
hew
that
you
are
not
mandated
to
send
public
school
teachers
into
the
private
school
even
to
avoid
logistic
problems.
i
would
like
to
devote
the
rest
of
my
time
here
up
to
the
amount
i’m
reserving,
except
for
that
i’m
reserving
for
rebuttal,
to
the
constitutional
issue.
in
the
event
we
are
incorrect,
in
the
event
that
this
court
decides
that
where
certain
services
are
provided
for
educational
services
by
title
i
teachers,
the
title
i
teachers
must
go
into
the
church
schools
to
perform
those
services.
we
would
suggest
that,
to
that
extent,
the
statute
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
now
in
saying
that,
it’s
important
to
know
that
the
issue
before
this
court
in
this
case
it's
quite
narrow,
we
are
not
challenging
other
title
i
services
which
are
permitted
under
the
statute,
including
those
specifically
stated
in
the
statute
as
mobile
equipment,
nor
those
which
hew
has,
in
its
interpretation
of
the
application
of
the
law,
held
to
be
permissible
such
as
breakfasts
or
medical
care.
we
do
not
challenge
sending
the
doctor
in
or
a
hot
breakfast
with
cooks
to
prepare
it.
we
are
challenging
only
about
the
basic.
and,
the
record
shows
basically
the
same
type
of
teaching
of
regular
subjects,
most
prominently
reading
and
arithmetic,
which
goes
into
the
public
schools
except
what?
except
smaller
classes
and
specially
trained
or
teachers
given
a
special
additional
training
of
task
force
how
to
handle
students
who
are
below
the
norm.
and
that,
too,
appears
in
the
typical
application.
again,
i
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
page
43
of
my
brief
which
is
typical
application,
item
four,
degree
of
education
deprivation
necessary
for
participation.
below
norm
on
standardized
test
by
three
months
for
primary
school,
six
months
for
intermediate,
nine
months
for
grade
seven,
if
a
student
is
below
those
norms,
he
is
put
into
a
smaller
class,
and
that’s
indicated,
and
he’s
given
a
teacher
and
the
teachers
will
be
given
a
crash
course
under
hew
sponsorship
on
how
to
handle
that
case.
now,
these
students
who
are
below
norm
are
not
students
who
are,
psychologically,
problems.
they
are
ordinary
students
who
for
variety
reasons.
the
best
example
is
the
one
which
the
court
of
appeals
gave
in
its
opinion
on
page
--
which
i
cite
on
page
a45,
footnote
13
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
a45,
no,
a15,
i’m
sorry,
a15
on
the
footnote.
it
says
the
record
discloses
that
our
lady
of
the
american
school,
a
parochial
school
in
kansas
city,
has
a
student
body
that
is
98%
excellent
with
approximately
175
students
eligible
for
title
i.
children
are
confronted
with
a
language
and
cultural
problem.
now,
that’s
all
i
want
to
read
from
the
brief.
what
do
we
have?
we
have
students
who,
because
they’re
foreign-born,
are
slower
than
the
average.
but,
the
instruction
given
is
basically
the
same
thing
as
the
instructions
given
in
other
students.
now,
it’s
our
contention
that
in
that
context
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
lemon
against
kurtzman,
earley
against
dicenso,
and
sanders
against
johnson,
where
this
court
said
you
cannot
finance
a
secular
instruction
in
church
schools.
what
is
the
difference?
the
education
is
basically
the
same,
ordinary
secular
education
and
even
in
the
lemon
against
kurtzman,
they
chose
these
secular
courses.
what
is
the
only
difference?
the
only
difference
between
this
situation
and
the
lemon,
dicenso,
johnson
cases
is
that,
in
this
situation
the
teachers
are
paid
directly
and
hired
directly
by
the
public
agency.
in
the
other
cases,
the
teachers
are
hired
originally
by
the
parochial
schools
but
paid
in
whole
and
part
out
of
public
funds.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
we
don’t
think
it’s
a
critical
difference.
we
say
this
because
of
a
number
of
reasons.
we
say
that
in
sum
that
the
potential
for
comfort,
and
i’m
reading
now
from
the
levitt
decision
which
this
court
decided
last
year
and
quoting
from
the
lemon
decision,
“the
potential
for
conflict
in
here,
in
this
situation,
just
as
it
did
in
the
levitt
and
the
dicenso,
lemon
case.
we
show,
we
argue,
and
we
show
from
the
record
that,
as
it
operates,
it
is
perfectly
permissible,
for
example,
it
is
perfectly
permissible
for
the
parochial
school
to
take
one
of
its
teachers
or
more,
divorce
them,
sever
them
from
the
payroll
and
assign
them
as
a
title
i
teacher.
they
get
special
training
and
they
come
back
only
to
stay
in
the
same
schools.
they
have
now
been
transferred
simply
from
one
payroll
to
another.
they
do
the
same
thing
except
they
are
now
under
public
payroll.
moreover,
and
this
is
the
--
and
this
is
interesting
that
they
may
even
be
employed
simultaneously
by
both.
if
you
--
and
the
regulations
which
i
quote
on
page
5
of
my
brief,
page
5
in
the
brief
says
as
follows:
provisions
for
section
--
this
is
from
the
regulations
cfr
section
116,
“provision
for
special
education
services
for
educationally
deprived
children
enrolled
in
private
schools
shall
not
include
the
paying
of
salaries
for
teachers
or
other
employees
of
private
schools.”
now,
the
next
is
critical,
“except
for
services
performed
outside
their
regular
hours
of
duty
and
under
public
supervision
and
control.”
in
other
words,
what
this
allows
is
for
a
parochial
school
teacher
to
teach
under
the
payroll
of
the
parochial
school
for
part
time
and
under
the
payroll
of
the
title
i,
the
other
part
of
the
title,
so
long
as
it
is
beyond
the
regular
hours
of
the
parochial
school
teacher
and
a
parochial
school
teacher
can
be
hired
from
9-3
or
from
9-1
or
9-12.
moreover,
the
--
while
you’re
looking,
you
have
the
severe
problem
of
the
fact
that
a
church
school
is
a
church
school
and
it
doesn’t
become
something
else
when
a
public
school,
publicly
employed
teacher
enters.
that
is
why
the
courts
which
have
been
faced
with
this
issue,
with
respect
to
state
law,
and
the
district
court
in
the
case
which
i
cite,
(inaudible)
against
oaktree,
the
district
court
in
the
first
circuit
said
--
which
involved
a
state
statute,
a
state
statute
which
says
that
public
school,
publicly
appointed
teachers
out
of
state
funds
may
teach
in
parochial
schools,
they
declared
not
unconstitutional
and,
i
commend
to
this
court,
the
court’s
opinion,
there
was
a
thorough
discussion
of
it
indicating
that
the
potential
for
--
the
law
of
the
constitution,
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
in
nyquist,
in
levitt,
in
lemon,
dicenso,
and
each
of
the
cases
said
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this
it
is
an
obligation
to
make
certain,
to
make
certain
that
the
publicly
employed
teacher
does
not
use
his
position
for
the
advancement
of
religion.
the
--
this
court
said
in
nyquist,
and
i
quote
it
on
page
30
referring
to
the
dicenso
case,
about
page
30,
the
role
on
legislature
has
not
and
could
not
provide
state
aid
on
the
basis
of
a
mere
assumption
that
secular
teachers
under
religious
discipline
can
avoid
conflicts.
the
state
and
this
is
emphasized,
the
emphasis
is
not
mine,
the
emphasis
of
this
court
in
a
nyquist
case
referring
to
the
dicenso
case,
the
state
must
be
certain,
given
the
religious
cause,
that
subsidized
teachers
do
not
inculcate
religion.
and
the
court
found
there,
in
both,
nyquist,
levitt,
dicenso,
lemon,
that
there
was
no
such
certainty.
there
is
no
such
certainty
in
this
case.
all
there
is,
is
a
statement
in
the
rule,
in
the
regulations
that
the
title
i
teachers
may
not
teach
religion.
but,
that
alone
--
that
was
also
the
case
in
each
one
of
these
cases.
all
the
state
statutes
struck
down
in
dicenso,
in
levitt,
in
lemon,
in
johnson.
all
those
had
the
same
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
sanction
was
there,
that
the
funds
could
be
and
would
be
turned
off.
and,
those
funds
went
to
the
teacher
himself.
there
was
a
clear
sanction
because
--
for
example,
in
dicenso
the
record
showed
that
a
teacher
who
wanted
to
get
public
funds
had
to
take
--
write
a
written
promise
of
kind
that
he
or
she
would
not
teach
any
religion
and
that
violation
of
that
meant,
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
dismissal
to
the
extent
of
being
paid
out
of
public
funds.
finally
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
alright,
thank
you.
now,
finally,
the
--
this
court
in
walz,
the
tax
exemption
case,
and
then
the
subsequent
cases
added
a
new
dimension
to
the
test
for
impermissibility
under
the
establishment
clause.
previously,
on
the
exempt
case,
it
was
a
forbidding
of
any
law
which
either
has
as
its
purpose
the
advancement
of
religion
whose
primary
effect
is
the
advancement
of
religion.
and,
we
do
not
assert
here
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
advance
religion,
we
say
its
effect
is.
but,
in
walz
and
then
in
lemon
cases,
this
court
added
intervention,
that
even
if
those
two
qualifications
was
satisfied,
if
the
result
of
the
law
is
entanglement
of
church
and
state,
that
too
is
unconstitutional.
it
was
a
new
dimension,
but
goes
back,
way
back
at
least
as
far
as
the
cases
in
which
the
court
said
it
could
not
intervene
and
try
church
disputes
going
back
to
the
civil
war
period.
but
this
entanglement,
which
is
one
of
the
foundations
of
the
statute,
is
inevitable
in
this
situation.
you
must,
in
order
to
assure
that
teachers
who
work
in
a
church
school
on
at
least
partially
the
supervision,
and
the
regulation
shows
that,
under
partial
supervision
of
the
school
authorities
do
not,
because
of
their
religious
commitment,
use
their
office
to
advance
religion.
it
must
be
put
under
continual
surveillance.
it
must
be
subject
to
continual
policing.
this
surveillance
is
exactly
what
the
court
tells,
forbid
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
take
exception
to
the
last
statement
made
by
mr.
friedman.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
mandate
of
the
district
court
that’s
clear
and
ambiguous
and
leaves
no
options.
it
says
the
defendant
is
enjoined
from
disapproving
any
application
of
the
local
educational
agency
on
the
basis
that
such
application
includes
the
use
of
title
i
personnel
in
private
school
premises
during
regular
school
hours.
there’s
no
way
of
interpreting
this
to
allow
shared
time.
shared
time
and,
certainly,
dual
enrollment
is
not
within
this.
it’s
not
use
of
time
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
therefore,
it
would
have
to
be
rejected.
it
would
have
to
be
rejected
because
we
are
enjoined,
we
are
enjoined
from
doing
anything,
but
sending
public
school
teachers
into
private
schools
during
school
others.
if
we
have
anything
else,
this
is
the
--
we
are
enjoined
from
doing
that.
now,
one
other
point
i
want
to
make
with
respect
to
that.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
do
not
concede
that
the
only
permissible
alternatives
under
the
act
are
dual
enrollment
and
sending
teachers
in.
we
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
statute
--
the
language
of
the
statute
which
is
on
page
3
of
our
brief
which
says
the
term
--
i’d
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
from
the
page,
such
page
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
page
3
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
justice
brennan.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i’m
sorry,
page
3
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
petition
for
certiorari,
yes
sir.
it
says,
dealing
with
private
schools,
“such
as
dual
enrollment,
educational
radio
and
television
and
mobile
education
service
and
equipment.”
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
statute
does
not
limit
and
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
the
only
alternatives
open
to
a
state
are
either
sending
the
public
school
teacher
in
or
dual
enrollment.
the
“such
as”
indicates
that
these
are
illustrative,
are
things
which
are
permissible.
another
point
i
shall
like
to
make,
and
this
is
in
response
to
a
statement
made
by
mr.
sullivan
in
response
to
a
question
by
a
member
of
the
court,
that
if
the
state
of
missouri
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
missouri
had
ruled,
for
example,
that
dual
enrollment
under
title
i
is
not
inconsistent
with
state
law,
the
state
board
of
education
takes
a
position
that
it
could
ignore
it
and
deem
itself
to
be
the
only
judge,
i
think
that,
obviously,
it’s
not
such.
of
course,
we
are
a
state
agency,
we
are
subject
to
the
judgments
of
a
state
supreme
court,
and
indeed,
our
position
is
based
upon
our
interpretation
of
a
state
supreme
court
decision.
if
the
state
supreme
court
says
to
us
it
is
not
a
violation
of
state
law
to
do
your
dual
enrollment
or
sending
type
i
teachers
in,
we’re
bound
by
that,
if
not,
there’ll
be
a
judgment
of
contempt
against
us.
we
say
only
that
in
between,
in
respect,
the
relationship,
the
inter-government
relationship
between
the
state
of
missouri
and
the
united
states
office
of
education
that
the
initial
responsibility
of
determining
the
state
law
rests
with
the
state
board
of
education.
now,
this
leads
us
to
another
point
in
respect
with
the
abstention.
in
the
district
court,
when
the
case
first
came
up,
we
did
not
initially
ask
for
abstention.
the
reason
for
that
was
that
we
took
the
position
that
state
law
was
clear
in
that
our
responsibility
under
state
law
was
clear
that
there
was
no
question
of
state
law
as
far
as
the
federal
district
was
concerned.
the
question
was
the
state
of
missouri,
speaking
through
its
state
board
of
education,
ruled
that
this
was
not
permissible.
then,
the
court
of
its
own
raised
it
and
we
then
replied
that
if
this
court
deems
that
this
is
relevant,
then
it
should
abstain
and
we
so
argued
it,
that
it's
abstained
until
a
state
court
decision
could
be
reached,
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
state
law
is
irrelevant.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
district
court
initially
abstained.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
then
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
it
and
said
that
state
law
is
irrelevant.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
because
it’s
a
federal
law
and,
therefore
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
that’s
in
the
--
that’s
referred
to.
that’
initial.
then,
we
sent
it
back
and
we
had
a
trial.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
our
view
initially
that
state
law
is
irrelevant
in
the
sense
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
state
law
--
then
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
would
be,
and
i
think
there’s
a
procedure
where
you
--
that
the
state
law
question
could
be
satisfied
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri,
assuming
that
that
is
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
you
could
do
that
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
justice
brennan,
although
--
you
could
do
that,
but
our
contention
of
course,
our
second
condition
is
that
even
if
state
law
is
not
violated
that
this
does
violate
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
the
establishment
clause.
so,
that
in
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
assume
so.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
assume
so.
the
--
i
think
that
would
be
correct,
but
we
would
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
only
thing
i
answer,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
except
for
the
original
argument,
we
could
not
convince
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
could
only
say
--
are
you
asking
my
opinion
or
the
opinion
of
the
state
board
of
education?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
state
board
of
education
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
our
position
is
that
state
law
is
that
dual
enrollment
and
sending
teachers
into
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
both
are
equally
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
both
equally
forbidden
by
the
state
constitution
of
missouri.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
that’s
true,
but
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
it’s
contrary
to
state
law
whether
it’s
--
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
exactly,
and
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
my
ultimate
position
is
that,
as
we
interpret
the
federal
statute,
the
federal
statute
requires
accommodation
to
state
law,
constitutional,
statutory,
and
decision.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
therefore,
it’s
the
whole
conglomeration,
not
merely
one
aspect
of
it.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
in
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
in
a
sense.
yes,
the
only
thing
i
can
also
answer
is,
as
i
interpret
it,
i
would
--
as
i
interpret
the
statute,
and
i
miss
in
there,
those
are
not
the
only
two
alternatives
permitted.
dual
enrollment
and
sending
in,
these
are
possible.
there
are
a
variety
of
alternatives.
we
have
been
foreclosed
by
the
decision
of
the
district
court
to
use
one
option.
the
option
which
we
want,
which
we
believe
is
the
best
option.
we’ve
been
foreclosed.
we've
been
foreclosed;
we
believe
it’s
violation
our
state
law,
our
state
constitution
to
send
public
school
teachers
in.
we’ve
been
told
to
forget
that.
you
cannot
use
that
as
criteria.
you’re
enjoined
from
it.
if
we
use
it,
we’re
under
contempt.
this
is
the
issue
before
the
court.
