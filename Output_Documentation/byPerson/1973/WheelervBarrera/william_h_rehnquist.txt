justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
pfeffer,
the
eighth
circuit,
as
i
read
their
opinion,
said
that
there
was
some
conflict
in
missouri
law
that
the
attorney
general
disagreed
with
the
superintendent
and
they
ended
up
saying
that
the
kind
of
injunction
judge
collinson
entered
was
in
conformity
with
missouri
law.
certainly,
we’re
not
going
to
second
guess
the
eight
circuit
on
what
the
law
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
turn
to
a20
and
a21
of
your
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
if
you
look
at
the
paragraph
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
80,
plaintiffs
discount
the
applicability
of
state
law
and
this
is
the
majority
opinion.
then,
judge
lei
goes
on
to
say
on
page
81
this
approach,
discounting
the
applicability
of
state
law,
substantially
ignores
the
legislative
history
of
title
i
which
establishes
that
state
policy
and
law
shall
govern
the
administration
of
these
programs.
so,
i
don’t
agree
with
your
reading
of
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
is
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
missouri
law,
i
take
it.
and,
certainly,
the
eighth
circuit
here
addressed
itself
to
a
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
and
said
“on
balance,
we
conclude
the
missouri
law
does
permit.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sullivan,
why
shouldn’t
the
district
court
have
abstained
here
if,
as
mr.
pfeffer
said
that
the
petitioner’s
requested
him
to
do,
if
there’s
a
significant
undecided
question
of
missouri
law
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
itself
which
ended
up
granting
you
relief
was
able
to
do
so
only
after
it
had
resolved
what
it
conceded
to
be
an
important
and
undecided
question
of
missouri
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
was
it
not
a
case
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
for
the
abstention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
just
begs
the
question,
i
think.
if
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eighth
circuit
conceded
in
its
opinion
that
there
was
an
important
question
of
missouri
law
involved,
it
went
ahead
and
decided
that
question.
so,
in
its
view
and
the
view
on
which
you
prevailed,
it
wasn’t
just
a
federal
right,
you
had
to
prove
a
question
of
missouri
law
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
sullivan,
certainly
what
i
had
conceived
to
be
the
undecided
point
of
missouri
law
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
at
page
a20
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
where
they
say
it’s
conceivable
that,
under
missouri
law,
the
use
of
all
funds
might
have
been
prohibited.
so,
it
isn’t
just
a
question
of
--
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
might
have
said
dual
enrollment
is
okay.
they
might
have
said
neither
of
these
is
okay.
and
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals,
their
opinion
says
if
that
had
been
the
missouri
law,
they
would
not
have
issued
the
injunction
which
they
issued
here.
so,
although
if
the
chief
justice’s
hypothesis
is
right
and
the
missouri
supreme
court
had
said
what
he
said,
the
options
would’ve
been
broadened.
it’s
conceivable
that
the
undecided
point
of
missouri
law
that
all
funds
are
barred
from
this
kind
of
a
thing
might
have
gone
the
other
way,
and
then
you
would’ve
gotten
no
relief
i
would
think.
