justice

j.

but
only
in
the
light,
i
thought
you
said
was
the
settlement
of
the
missouri
law
that
has
an
alternative,
dual
enrollment,
was
as
a
matter
of
state
law
prohibited.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it’s
based
on
that
consideration
that
the
statute
was
applied
the
way
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
hours?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
take
care
of
the
problem
themselves.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
there
any
school
districts
that
have
after
hours
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
injunction,
anyway,
applies
only
to
the
school
districts
we
have
involved
here,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
sullivan,
suppose
there
had
been
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
reaching
a
contrary
result
on
this
issue
of
state
law.
at
the
time
this
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
reaching
a
different
decision
on
state
law
than
the
court
of
appeals
came
to,
do
you
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
dual
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
permissible.
now,
if
there
had
--
if
that
had
been
the
state
of
the
missouri
law,
and
this
case
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
do
you
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
would
come
out
with
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute
than
it
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
wouldn’t
have
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
you
think
if
the
missouri
supreme
court
had
said
that
dual
enrollment
was
a
proper
--
was
proper
under
the
educational
law
of
missouri,
that
the
state
board
of
education
would
have
ignored
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
missouri
supreme
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
one
money
and
property
may
also
be
received
from
the
united
states
and
be
redistributed
together
with
public
money
of
this
state.
is
that
the
one,
missouri
constitutional
brief?
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
section
38a.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
doing
that
i
take
it,
mr.
friedman
though,
within
any
limitations
that
may
be
imposed
by
state
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is,
i
mean,
the
local
educational
authorities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
to
adhere
to
state
law,
do
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
friedman,
did
you
say
that
--
does
the
law
require
that
only
public
school
teachers
could
be
used?
for
example,
could
a
local
board
of
education
employ
some
trained
professional
in
teaching
in
a
parochial
school?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
get
this,
mr.
friedman.
looking
at
a46,
this
is
the
modified
injunction
consistent
with
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
“defendants
are
enjoined
from
disapproving
any
application
on
the
basis
that
such
basis
includes
the
use
of
title
i
personnel
on
private
school
premises
during
regular
school
hours.”
and
what
you’re
suggesting
is
that
the
missouri
authorities
may
in
fact
go
to,
say,
a
dual
enrollment
way
of
complying
with
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
that
if
they
did
so,
then
they
would
not
be
violating
this
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
the
point
though.
it’s
not
within
this
and
if
an
application
is
submitted
which
says
the
way
we
propose
to
enforce
the
program
is
on
dual
enrollment,
then
it’s
not
an
application
which
the
state
is
going
to
use
personnel
and
private
school
premises
during
regular
school
hours.

refused

did
it?

i

that
is
in

is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

may
i
ask,
what
--
would
you
it
be
your
view,
mr.
pfeffer,
that
it’s
open
to
us
still
to
direct
the
abstention
if
we
thought
was
appropriate
thing
to
do
here?
justice
william

i

but
suppose
we
would
disagree
with
you
and
we
thought
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
question
is
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
vacate,
and
send
this
back
and
direct
abstention.
in
your
view,
we
could
do
that?

student
body?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather,
any
state
under
this
program,
it's
legislature
could
adopt
the
law
forbidding
any
school
district
of
the
state
from
applying
to
participate
in
this

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
well
now
if
the
missouri
constitution
is
to
be
read
as,
in
effect,
prohibiting
any
state
and
any
school
district
from
applying,
then
we’d
never
have
to
reach
the
establishment
clause
question
in
this
case,
wouldn’t
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
if
that
were
so,
i
think
you’d
agree,
mr.
pfeffer,
then
at
least
there
is
an
issue
here
that
might
be
avoided
by
directing
abstention.
