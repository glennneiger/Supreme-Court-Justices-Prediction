mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
just
briefly
to
explain
to
the
court
how
title
i
of
the
educate
--
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965
operates
because
i
think
that’s
crucial
to
the
case.
the
statute
was
passed
because
of
a
recognition
by
the
president
and
the
congress
that
there’s
a
large
number,
literally
millions,
of
educationally
deprived
children
in
this
country
who,
because
of
lack
of
adequate
education,
would
not
be
able
to
assume
their
rightful
and
proper
place
in
american
society.
and,
the
basic
purpose
of
this
statute
as
described
in
the
congressional
declaration
of
policy
at
the
outset
of
the
statute
was
to
enable
the
local
educational
authorities
to
meet
the
special
educational
needs
of
educationally
deprived
children.
the
focus
of
the
act,
the
way
the
act
is
created,
is
to
turnover
vast
amounts
of
federal
money
to
the
state
educational
authorities
in
order
to
correct,
in
order
to
improve
the
deficiencies
that
existed
in
the
education
of
these
educationally
deprived
children
and,
it
deals
with
children
who
come
from
poverty.
the
basic
touchstone
for
getting
the
aid
is
that
the
children
must
come
from
areas
of
the
city
of
the
country
where
the
income
level
is
low.
now
the
plan,
as
it’s
envisioned,
basically
is
as
follows:
the
states
initially
apply
to
the
commissioner
of
education
for
authorization,
a
rather
simple
document
for
which
they
all
filed
and
were
--
these
documents
were
approved
89
years
ago
saying
they
wished
to
participate
in
the
program
and
they
will
meet
the
statutory
standards.
the
statutory
standards
are
very
general.
what
it
says,
basically,
is
that
the
state
educational
authority
shall
approve
applications
filed
by
local
authorities
which
are
consistent
with
the
guidelines
promulgated
by
the
commissioner
of
education.
the
commissioner
of
education
just
promulgated
guidelines.
the
statute
least
explicitly
informed
discretion
of
the
local
educational
authorities,
the
local
boards
of
education,
to
determine
what
is
the
most
appropriate
method,
the
most
effective
method,
for
meeting
the
special
educational
needs
of
these
educationally
deprived
children
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
local
educational
authorities
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
to
adhere
to
state
law
and,
indeed,
the
regulations
specifically
recognizes
and
contemplate
it,
and
recognizes
it
because
of
certain
requirements
of
state
law,
there
may
be
situations
where
particular
programs
have
to
be
worked
at.
but
the
programs,
of
course,
are
all
supplementary
services.
these
basically
are
services
that
would
not
be
provided
in
the
schools,
public
and
private,
under
the
schools’
normal
operating
procedures.
these
are
children
who
are
not
able
to
meet,
were
not
able
to
meet
the
normal
standards.
the
regulations
of
the
commissioner
define
educationally
deprived
child
as
one
who’s
educational
achievements
do
not
reach
the
level
customarily
associated
with
children
of
this
age
group.
this
is
the
basic
thrust
of
the
statute
is
to
help
bring
the
level
of
all
of
the
children
up,
and
of
course,
the
statute
is
not
in
any
way
directed
to
aiding
schools.
the
statute
is
designed
to
help
the
problem
of
the
children
and
the
statute,
unlike
those
which
this
court
had
before
it
in
some
of
these
other
cases,
is
not
in
any
way
designed
to
aid
the
private
schools.
these
are
not
cases
such
as
lemon,
dicenso,
nyquist
in
which
the
state
has
decided
that
the
private
schools
have
a
serious
financial
problem
and
they
need
an
infusion
of
government
aid
to
keep
them
going.
this
is
a
statute
in
which
congress
decided
that
children
not
schools,
children
need
help.
children
need
help
to
enable
them
to
achieve
their
rightful
place
in
america
and
the
congress
recognized
that
these
children
who
need
help
are
not
only
in
the
public
schools.
they’re
also
in
the
private
schools.
poverty
draws
no
lines
between
the
public
and
the
private
schools.
religiously
affiliated
schools
have
just
as
many
poor
children
as
the
public
schools.
in
this
very
case,
the
two
parochial
schools
that
are
involved
are
in
the
ghetto
of
the
city
of
kansas
city.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it’s
unfortunate
of
condition
which
does
not
--
which
draws
no
lines
and
it’s
a
condition
that
you
could
have.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
continue
briefly
with
my
discussion
of
the
way
the
statute
operates.
and,
the
next
point
i’d
like
to
make
is
that
this
program
is
completely
under
the
control
of
the
public
authorities.
it
is
the
local
school
district
and
state
educational
authorities
that
formulate
the
plans.
the
state
educational
authorities
review
the
plans
for
the
clients
with
the
standards.
the
teachers
who
provide
these
services
are
all
employees
of
the
public
school
agencies.
there
are
no
teachers
providing
these
schools
who
are
employed
by
any
of
the
religiously
affiliated
schools.
the
teachers
are
subject
to
control
and
supervision
of
the
public
school
authorities,
not
under
the
control
of
the
private
school
authorities.
and
of
course,
as
i
think
is
clear
by
now,
there
are
no
funds
at
all
under
this
statute
paid
to
the
private
schools.
the
funds
are
all
paid
to
the
state
and
it’s
the
state
who
provides
these
services.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
the
vast
bulk
of
these
services
go
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
--
they
could
only
employ
them,
for
example,
during,
say,
in
a
summer
situation.
they
could
--
i
think
and
let
me
explain
that
if
i
may,
mr.
justice,
the
way
that
it’s
set
up.
the
actual
control
of
the
teachers,
the
actual
content
of
the
programs
is
all
handled
by
the
local
authorities.
now
to
the
extent,
i
suppose,
that
state
law
would
permit
the
state
public
authorities
to
hire
someone
who
is
teaching
in
the
parochial
school
part
time
during
the
summer
to
conduct
the
remedial
reading
program,
i
would
see
no
problem
to
that.
but,
what
they
cannot
do
is
they
cannot
say
a
teacher
who
is
teaching
in
one
of
the
parochial
schools,
you
ought
to
spend
part
of
your
time
now
providing
these
title
i
services.
the
services
must
be
provided
by
the
public
school
people.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
as
i
say
and
i
perhaps
i
misspoken
myself
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
not
suggesting
that
they
have
to
be
regularly,
otherwise,
utilized
teachers
in
the
public
school.
they
could
certainly,
and
i’m
sure
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
they
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
this
purpose
alone,
but
they
are
employees
of
the
public
school
authorities.
that’s
the
point
i
wanted
to
make.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
now,
the
vast
bulk
of
the
children
who
are
receiving
the
benefits
of
these
services
are
enrolled
in
the
public
schools.
the
indications
we
have
is
that
approximately
only
5%
of
the
children
who
are
receiving
the
benefits
of
these
services
are,
in
fact,
enrolled
in
the
private
schools.
now,
one
other
thing
i
think
is
important,
in
contrast
to
the
situation
with
the
plans
involved
in
the
lemon
case;
in
the
lemon
case
the
grants
were
made
for
the
provision
of
secular
educational
services,
and
therefore,
you
had
the
excessive
government
involvement.
i’d
like
to
stress
the
standard
this
court
has
always
recognized
as
excessive
government
involvement.
there
may
be
situations
where
there’s
some
government
involvement.
the
thing
is,
there
can’t
be
excessive
government
involvement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
stand
corrected,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
excessive
government
entanglement.
there,
in
the
lemon
type
of
situation,
it
was
necessary
for
the
state
to
subject
the
activities
in
the
religious
schools
to
surveillance
to
be
sure
that
the
teachers
who
were
being
subsidized
or
the
school
--
the
money
which
the
school
was
receiving
was
used
solely
for
secular
purposes
and
that
was
one
of
the
serious
vices
that
this
court
found
in
the
lemon
case.
here,
there’s
no
use
at
all
of
any
moneys
possible
for
that
purpose
and
the
educational
authorities,
the
state
authorities,
do
not
have
to
make
any
determination
what
is
secular,
what
is
sectarian,
whether
the
teachers
are
strictly
observing
the
limitations,
that
the
parochial
school
teachers
when
they
are
paid
with
the
state
funds
are
in
fact
limiting
themselves
to
secular
services.
there’s
not
that
problem
in
this
case
because,
here,
what
you’re
having
basically,
as
i’ve
indicated,
is
the
provision
of
supplemental
services,
mainly
remedial
reading,
remedial
mathematics,
speech,
that
kind
of
thing
which
is
necessary
to
bring
to
children
up
to
a
decent
educational
level.
now,
i’d
like
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
the
statutory
question
in
the
case,
and
there’s
been
a
lot
of
discussion
here
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case.
the
actual
holding
on
the
issue
of
what
is
permitted
or
required
under
the
statute,
i
think,
is
set
forth
in
the
first
sentence
of
page
a25
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
and,
what
the
court
said
at
the
top
of
the
page
is
“thus,
we
find
that
when
the
need
for
educationally
disadvantaged
children
requires
it,
title
i
authorizes,”
not
requires,
“title
i
authorizes
special
teaching
services,
as
contemplated
within
the
act
and
regulations,
to
be
furnished
by
the
public
agency
on
private
as
well
as
public
school
premises.”
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
what
the
court
is
saying
i
think,
mr.
justice,
is
that
there
is
a
requirement
under
the
act
that
the
services
provided
be
comparable.
and,
if
the
only
way
in
which
the
state
is
providing
the
services
is
by
providing
them
during
hours,
during
the
school
hours,
on
the
premises
of
the
public
school
that
the
child
regularly
attends,
then
they
have
to
provide
comparable
services
in
the
private
schools
to
send
the
teachers
on.
but,
as
this
case
now
stands,
we
don’t
know
what
the
state
of
missouri
is
going
to
formulate
in
the
way
of
a
plan.
perhaps,
the
state
of
missouri
may
now
decide
in
the
light
of
these
--
of
the
decision
in
this
case
that
it
will
provide
these
services
in
the
public
schools
after
hours.
it
provides
them
in
the
public
schools
after
hours,
under
the
injunction
issue
by
the
district
court
it
is
not
required
also
to
provide
these
services
in
the
private
schools
after
hours
or,
conceivably,
the
state
of
missouri
may
now
decide
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
but,
mr.
justice,
that
is
because
of
the
conduct
--
the
reason
the
state
has
to
respond
to
this
is
because
of
the
requirement
in
the
statute
that
it’s
comparable.
they
have
to
provide
comparable
services.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
part
of
the
issue,
mr.
justice,
but
we
don’t
know
at
this
time,
one,
whether
the
state
is
going
to
undertake
and
furnish
them
on
that
basis,
but
two,
precisely
how
it’s
going
to
furnish
them.
it
--
in
this
case,
it
strikes
me
as
a
somewhat
strange
situation.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
declined
to
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
this
issue
because
it
said
we
have
no
precise
plan
before
us.
we
don’t
know
exactly
how
these
services
are
going
to
be
provided.
all
they
described
is
a
conjectural
hypothetical
state
of
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
district
court
has
interpreted
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
saying
that
if
you
provide
services
on
the
public
school
premises
which
the
child
customarily
attends,
that
is
in
the
school
where
the
child
attends,
and
if
this
is
done
during
regular
school
hours
in
the
light
of
testimony
that
when
you
have
that
kind
of
a
situation
after
hours
or
saturdays
or
summer
school
is
not
educationally
comparable,
in
that
one
situation,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
is
necessary
to
provide
similar
services
in
the
private
school.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that’s
permissible
under
state
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
just
briefly
to
explain
to
the

how

court
had
before
it
in
some
of
these
other
cases,
is
not
in
any
way
designed
to
aid
the
private
schools.
these
are
not
cases
such
as
lemon,
dicenso,
nyquist
in
which
the
state
has
decided
that
the
private
schools
have
a
serious
financial
problem
and
they
need
an
infusion
of
government
aid
to
keep
them
going.
this
is
a
statute
in
which
congress
decided
that
children
not
schools,
children
need
help.
children
need
help
to
enable
them
to
achieve
their
rightful
place
in
america
and
the
congress
recognized
that
these
children
who
need
help
are
not
only
in
the
public
schools.
they’re
also
in
the
private
schools.
poverty
draws
no
lines
between
the
public
and
the
private
schools.
religiously
affiliated
schools
have
just
as
many
poor
children
as
the
public
schools.
in
this
very
case,
the
two
parochial
schools
that
are
involved
are
in
the
ghetto
of
the
city
of
kansas
city.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it’s
unfortunate
of
condition
which
does
not
--
which
draws
no
lines
and
it’s
a
condition
that
you
could
have.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
continue
briefly
with
my
discussion
of
the
way
the
statute
operates.
and,
the
next
point
i’d
like
to
make
is
that
this
program
is
completely
under
the
control
of
the
public
authorities.
it
is
the
local
school
district
and
state
educational
authorities
that
formulate
the
plans.
the
state
educational
authorities
review
the
plans
for
the
clients
with
the
standards.
the
teachers
who
provide
these
services
are
all
employees
of
the
public
school
agencies.
there
are
no
teachers
providing
these
schools
who
are
employed
by
any
of
the
religiously
affiliated
schools.
the
teachers
are
subject
to
control
and
supervision
of
the
public
school
authorities,
not
under
the
control
of
the
private
school
authorities.
and
of
course,
as
i
think
is
clear
by
now,
there
are
no
funds
at
all
under
this
statute
paid
to
the
private
schools.
the
funds
are
all
paid
to
the
state
and
it’s
the
state
who
provides
these
services.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
the
vast
bulk
of
these
services
go
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
--
they
could
only
employ
them,
for
example,
during,
say,
in
a
summer
situation.
they
could
--
i
think
and
let
me
explain
that
if
i
may,
mr.
justice,
the
way
that
it’s
set
up.
the
actual
control
of
the
teachers,
the
actual
content
of
the
programs
is
all
handled
by
the
local
authorities.
now
to
the
extent,
i
suppose,
that
state
law
would
permit
the
state
public
authorities
to
hire
someone
who
is
teaching
in
the
parochial
school
part
time
during
the
summer
to
conduct
the
remedial
reading
program,
i
would
see
no
problem
to
that.
but,
what
they
cannot
do
is
they
cannot
say
a
teacher
who
is
teaching
in
one
of
the
parochial
schools,
you
ought
to
spend
part
of
your
time
now
providing
these
title
i
services.
the
services
must
be
provided
by
the
public
school
people.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
as
i
say
and
i
perhaps
i
misspoken
myself
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
not
suggesting
that
they
have
to
be
regularly,
otherwise,
utilized
teachers
in
the
public
school.
they
could
certainly,
and
i’m
sure
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
they
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
this
purpose
alone,
but
they
are
employees
of
the
public
school
authorities.
that’s
the
point
i
wanted
to
make.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
now,
the
vast
bulk
of
the
children
who
are
receiving
the
benefits
of
these
services
are
enrolled
in
the
public
schools.
the
indications
we
have
is
that
approximately
only
5%
of
the
children
who
are
receiving
the
benefits
of
these
services
are,
in
fact,
enrolled
in
the
private
schools.
now,
one
other
thing
i
think
is
important,
in
contrast
to
the
situation
with
the
plans
involved
in
the
lemon
case;
in
the
lemon
case
the
grants
were
made
for
the
provision
of
secular
educational
services,
and
therefore,
you
had
the
excessive
government
involvement.
i’d
like
to
stress
the
standard
this
court
has
always
recognized
as
excessive
government
involvement.
there
may
be
situations
where
there’s
some
government
involvement.
the
thing
is,
there
can’t
be
excessive
government
involvement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
stand
corrected,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
excessive
government
entanglement.
there,
in
the
lemon
type
of
situation,
it
was
necessary
for
the
state
to
subject
the
activities
in
the
religious
schools
to
surveillance
to
be
sure
that
the
teachers
who
were
being
subsidized
or
the
school
--
the
money
which
the
school
was
receiving
was
used
solely
for
secular
purposes
and
that
was
one
of
the
serious
vices
that
this
court
found
in
the
lemon
case.
here,
there’s
no
use
at
all
of
any
moneys
possible
for
that
purpose
and
the
educational
authorities,
the
state
authorities,
do
not
have
to
make
any
determination
what
is
secular,
what
is
sectarian,
whether
the
teachers
are
strictly
observing
the
limitations,
that
the
parochial
school
teachers
when
they
are
paid
with
the
state
funds
are
in
fact
limiting
themselves
to
secular
services.
there’s
not
that
problem
in
this
case
because,
here,
what
you’re
having
basically,
as
i’ve
indicated,
is
the
provision
of
supplemental
services,
mainly
remedial
reading,
remedial
mathematics,
speech,
that
kind
of
thing
which
is
necessary
to
bring
to
children
up
to
a
decent
educational
level.
now,
i’d
like
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
the
statutory
question
in
the
case,
and
there’s
been
a
lot
of
discussion
here
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case.
the
actual
holding
on
the
issue
of
what
is
permitted
or
required
under
the
statute,
i
think,
is
set
forth
in
the
first
sentence
of
page
a25
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
and,
what
the
court
said
at
the
top
of
the
page
is
“thus,
we
find
that
when
the
need
for
educationally
disadvantaged
children
requires
it,
title
i
authorizes,”
not
requires,
“title
i
authorizes
special
teaching
services,
as
contemplated
within
the
act
and
regulations,
to
be
furnished
by
the
public
agency
on
private
as
well
as
public
school
premises.”
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
what
the
court
is
saying
i
think,
mr.
justice,
is
that
there
is
a
requirement
under
the
act
that
the
services
provided
be
comparable.
and,
if
the
only
way
in
which
the
state
is
providing
the
services
is
by
providing
them
during
hours,
during
the
school
hours,
on
the
premises
of
the
public
school
that
the
child
regularly
attends,
then
they
have
to
provide
comparable
services
in
the
private
schools
to
send
the
teachers
on.
but,
as
this
case
now
stands,
we
don’t
know
what
the
state
of
missouri
is
going
to
formulate
in
the
way
of
a
plan.
perhaps,
the
state
of
missouri
may
now
decide
in
the
light
of
these
--
of
the
decision
in
this
case
that
it
will
provide
these
services
in
the
public
schools
after
hours.
it
provides
them
in
the
public
schools
after
hours,
under
the
injunction
issue
by
the
district
court
it
is
not
required
also
to
provide
these
services
in
the
private
schools
after
hours
or,
conceivably,
the
state
of
missouri
may
now
decide
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
but,
mr.
justice,
that
is
because
of
the
conduct
--
the
reason
the
state
has
to
respond
to
this
is
because
of
the
requirement
in
the
statute
that
it’s
comparable.
they
have
to
provide
comparable
services.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
part
of
the
issue,
mr.
justice,
but
we
don’t
know
at
this
time,
one,
whether
the
state
is
going
to
undertake
and
furnish
them
on
that
basis,
but
two,
precisely
how
it’s
going
to
furnish
them.
it
--
in
this
case,
it
strikes
me
as
a
somewhat
strange
situation.
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
declined
to
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
this
issue
because
it
said
we
have
no
precise
plan
before
us.
we
don’t
know
exactly
how
these
services
are
going
to
be
provided.
all
they
described
is
a
conjectural
hypothetical
state
of
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
district
court
has
interpreted
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
saying
that
if
you
provide
services
on
the
public
school
premises
which
the
child
customarily
attends,
that
is
in
the
school
where
the
child
attends,
and
if
this
is
done
during
regular
school
hours
in
the
light
of
testimony
that
when
you
have
that
kind
of
a
situation
after
hours
or
saturdays
or
summer
school
is
not
educationally
comparable,
in
that
one
situation,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
is
necessary
to
provide
similar
services
in
the
private
school.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that’s
permissible
under
state
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
