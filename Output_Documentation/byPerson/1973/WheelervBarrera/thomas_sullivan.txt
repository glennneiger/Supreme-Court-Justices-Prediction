mr.
thomas
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
let
me
try
to
outline
our
position
in
this
case
as
it
has
been
from
the
time
we
filed
the
complaint.
we
say
that
the
title
i
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965
provided
that
comparable
educational
services
for
educationally
deprived
children
relating
to
special
educational
benefits
must
be
provided
on
the
basis
consistent
with
their
number
and
the
extent
of
their
educational
deprivation.
we
say
that
this
had
to
be
done
on
a
comparable
basis
across
the
board
for
public
and
non-public
children
alike.
we
say
that,
in
carrying
this
out,
certain
regulations
were
promulgated
by
the
office
of
education.
we
say
that
this
is
a
federal
law,
funded
entirely
by
federal
funds.
it’s
a
federal
law.
there’s
no
matching
funds,
no
state
funds
of
any
kind.
we
say
that
in
missouri
the
state
board
of
education,
very
early
in
the
game,
took
steps
to
preclude
either
dual
enrollment
or
the
mobile
educational
service
of
sending
the
teacher
in
--
the
public
school
teacher
into
the
private
school.
we
say
that
in
almost
every
situation,
when
the
state
board
precluded
those
two
methods
of
participation
in
the
--
by
the
private
school,
the
private
school
children
could
not,
did
not,
have
not
received
their
fair
equitable,
comparable
participation
in
title
i
benefits.
we
say
that
in
missouri
we
recognize
that
there’s
a
compulsory
attendance
statute
that
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to,
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
has
interpreted
as
to
preclude
dual
enrollment
or
shared
time.
we
say
that
if
we’re
going
to
accommodate
that
decision
and
that
state
law
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggests,
the
only
thing
and
the
only
other
way
that
we
can
receive
comparable
educational
benefits
in
the
private
--
for
the
private
school
children
is
by
sending
the
public
school
title
i
teacher
into
the
private
school
to
teach
the
educationally
deprived
qualified
eligible
non-public
school
children
and
to
give
them
the
title
i
benefits
in
that
fashion.
we
say
generally
that
this
is
constitutional
for
a
number
of
reasons.
we
say
that
the
regulations
in
the
act
have
made
a
provision
that
would
make
it
beyond
and
question,
it
seems
to
me,
affected
by
the
establishment
clause
and
we
say
that
the
relief
directed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
implemented
by
the
injunction
in
the
order
of
the
district
court
is
a
proper,
lawful,
and
clearly
warranted
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
sir?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
not
in
missouri,
mr.
justice,
because
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
think
it
could
be,
certainly.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right,
mr.
justice,
with
reference
to
missouri
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
it
would
be
in
missouri.
that
order
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
mr.
justice.
they
did
not
say
that.
they
said
that
the
act
did
not
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
but
they
did
say
they
were
wrong.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
said
the
act--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
said
the
act
did
not
provide
any
particular
method,
and
i
think
i
can
quote
that,
they
said
the
act
could
not
provide
any
particular
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
“we
further
observe
that
no
particular
program
or
service
is
mandatory
under
the
act.”
they
took
that,
in
that
part
of
their
opinion,
they
analyzed
the
holding
the
statute
and
the
holding
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
they
said
that,
in
missouri,
there
will
not
be
shared
time,
there
will
not
be
dual
enrollment.
we’re
going
to
accommodate
state
law
in
that
respect.
they
found
no
such
law
with
respect
to
sending
public
school
teachers
into
public
schools
of
missouri.
so,
accordingly
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
it
construed
the
act
that
way,
but
only
in
the
sense
and
in
the
background
of
the
evidence
and
facts
presented
to
it.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
in
missouri?
that’s
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
did,
but
as
i
say,
only
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
and
the
background
that
was
presented
to
them
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right.
based
on
that
consideration
-
mr.
thomas
sullivan
--
and
the
further
element
inherent
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
in
the
injunction
that
it
only
applies
or
the
title
i
benefits
are
rendered
on
--
during
regular
school
hours
on
public
school
premises.
now,
there
are
at
least
one
and
perhaps
more
local
educational
agencies,
that
is
the
school
districts
as
we
used
this
term,
in
missouri,
due
to
their
size
or
due
to
their
nature,
do
one
of
two
other
things.
there’s
one
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
there’s
one
that
has
no
title
i
grant
and
they
won’t
request
it
for
reasons
of
their
own.
they’re
a
well-funded
school
district.
they
won’t
request
it
and
they
haven’t
and,
that’s
regardless
of
how
many
educationally
deprived
or
in
the
private
school
there,
in
that
school
district,
they
just--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right
and
the
eligible
or
otherwise
eligible
children
in
private
schools,
they
have
no
right
under
the
act
to
request
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
one
or
two,
yes.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
and
they
have
it.
the
entire
program,
it’s
either
after
hours
or
in
the
summer
time.
there
are
smaller
districts
where
those
programs
seem
to
at
least,
i’m
not
an
educator
but
it
seems,
as
i
understand
it,
they
work
in
those
school
districts.
i
think,
though,
it
is
clear
and
a
court,
the
district
court
in
its
injunction
and
the
court
of
appeals,
excludes
that.
they
don’t
say
that
you
have
private
services
in
private
schools
for
educations
for
our
children
across
the
state.
they
say
all
in
one
is
provided
in
the
public
school
in
missouri
in
light
of
the
compulsory
tenants
there.
now
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
it
only
applies
to
state
board
of
education.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
and
that
was
the
only
--
and
the
commissioner.
those
were
the
only
defendants
on
the
case.
those
were
the
only
ones
sued.
the
--
that
is
the
first
section
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
and
if
that
is
the
meaning
of
it,
of
course,
that
--
if
they’re
saying
that
the
act
does
not
mandate
assignment
of
publicly
employed
teachers
in
--
to
teach
in
religious
schools
during
the
regular
school
hours,
if
they’re
saying
that
the
act
does
not
verbally
or
literally
say
that
you
must
send
in
public
school
teachers
to
teach
in
the
non-public
schools
for
educationally
deprived
children,
we,
of
course
--
that’s
their
own
windmill
that
they’re
charging.
the
court
of
appeals
never
said
that
and
i’ve
never
said
that
and
our
complaint
never
said
that.
the
court
of
appeals
said
just
the
opposite
really.
they
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
as
i
mentioned
before,
it’s
on
page
a26
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
page
1354
of
the
f
2nd
citation.
the
court
of
appeals
says
“we
further
observe
that
no
particular
program
or
service
is
mandatory
under
the
act.”
and
that,
of
course,
is
what
the
congress
intended
and
that’s
what
the
united
states
commissioner
of
office
of
education
intended.
they
presented
outlines
and
methods,
but
no
particular
service
is
mandatory.
then,
they
went
on
to
say,
but
it
granted
these
other
conditions.
in
missouri,
they
must
send
in
title
i
publicly
employed
title
school
--
title
i
teachers
into
the
private
schools.
and
that,
of
course,
is
further
subject
to
the
regulation
that
they
can
teach
of
course
special
educational
subjects
for
eligible
educationally
deprived
children
under
this
essentially
welfare
act,
it
seems
to
me.
but,
furthermore,
they
cannot
teach
any
course
which
is
already
being
taught
in
the
private
school
and
the
regulation
clearly
provides
for
this.
so
it’s
still
a
very
narrow
situation.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
he
should
not
have
abstained
because
we
were
seeking
relief
under
the
federal
acts.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
he
did
but
he
--
well,
let
me
withdraw
that.
in
the
first
instance,
he
did
abstain
and
he
also
held
that,
there,
we
had
an
exhausted
macerated
remedies.
and,
we
had
to
take
that
to
the
eighth
circuit.
and,
of
course,
that
was
reversed
by
the
eighth
circuit
because
in
the
earlier
opinion
they
said
this
is
not
a
case
for
abstention.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
chief
judge
--
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
because
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
because
these
youngsters
were
seeking
their
federally
established
rights.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
we
approve
the
question
of
missouri
law,
but
i
still
think
the
basic
question
was
always
federal
under
title
i
the
title
--
our
rights
under
the
title
i
act.
now,
on
the
abstention
cases
and
the
way
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
those
--
this
case,
under
the
abstention
cases,
never
felt
that
i
can
recall
what
the
federal
statute
--
it
was
first
contrasting
a
state
law
with
the
federal
constitution
and
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
they
would’ve
said
any
one
is
alright,
but
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
still
think
we
would’ve
had
the
same
position
on
the
part
of
the
state
board
of
education.
i
don’t
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
would
have
meant
anything
to
them.
i
still
think
they
would
have
denied
all
the
rights
to
these
private
school
children.
as
they
say
in
their
brief
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
state
board
says
in
their
own
brief,
and
particularly
in
their
reply
brief,
that
it
is
the
state
department
of
education
that
determines
what
the
relevant
state
law
is
and
they’re
the
ones
that
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
think
so.
i
mean,
that’s
what
they
say
in
their
reply
brief.
they
say
they
determined
what
the
applicable
state
law
is.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
would’ve
hope
that
dual
enrollment
would
have
been--
provisions
would’ve
been
made
for
dual
enrollment.
i
would’ve
hoped
that
the
children
could’ve
participated
and
received
their
genuine
opportunities
in
the
language
of
the
guidelines
to
participate
in
comparable
programs.
i
would’ve
hoped
that
was
the
case
if
dual
enrollment
was
included
in
this
one.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
he
--
with
respect
to
dual
enrollment?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
i
don’t
--
if
there
was
a
--
if
dual
enrollment
was
available,
i
mean,
that
would’ve
been
a
maybe
a
little
more
cumbersome
and
awkward
but
certainly
had
been
a
valid
way
to
--
for
these
children
to
receive
their
educational
benefits
and
i
would
hope
that
it
would’ve
been
done.
it
would’ve
been
carried
out
in
the
programs
and
projects.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
mr.
--
judge
lei
in
the
majority
opinion
said
he
hypothesized
a
situation,
if
this
is
i
think
an
answer,
that
on
page
--
i’m
looking
at
the
slip
sheet
23,
a23
in
the
appendix.
he
says
state
law
must
be
accommodated,
but
he
says
suppose
missouri
passed
a
law
that
prevented
it
just
this,
that
no
textbook,
school
books,
title
i
aid,
any
other
bsa
aid,
federal
milk
program
in
the
state
of
missouri
shall
be
prevented
to
go
into
a
private
school
premises
nor
shall
there
be
dual
enrollment.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
there’d
be
no
title
i.
that’s
right
mr.
chief
justice.
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
and
we
have
to
assume
the
existence
of
such
a
law
or
statute,
which
there
is
none.
they
don’t
profess
that
there’s
a
constitutional
article
in
the
state
of
missouri
which
says,
generally,
that
any
federal
program
can
be
--
will
be
accommodated
in
missouri
and
that’s
part
of
missouri
constitution
cited
by
judge
lei
towards
the
latter
part
of
his
opinion.
and,
that
was
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
missouri
constitutional
amendment
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
article
iii
section
38?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
and
so,
i
think
we’ve
obviated
that
situation.
but,
again,
if
there
was
such
a
law,
if
they
just
block
everything,
or
attempt
to
block
it
by
statute,
as
judge
lei
says,
assuming
that
the
equal
protection
problem
would
be
overcome,
there
could
be
no
title
i.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
it
was,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
child
should
stay
in
his
own
school
for
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
so
many
hours
a
day
and
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that
wasn’t
included
in
that
case.
it
was
included
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
only
one
that
was
included
in
that
--
there
was
a
mention
in
that
case
that
public
school
teachers
employed
a
virtue
of
trust
on
it
in
the
opinion,
but
for
public
school
teachers
employed
out
of
missouri
public
school
fund
to
teach
in
public
schools.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
can’t
be
sent
to
private
schools.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
fiscal
elements
of
missouri
constitution.
and,
i
think
that
was
in
that
same
case,
but
only
the
fiscal
elements.
there’s
no
question
--
we
are
the
first
in
the
school
district
of
--
first
amendment
or
anything
else.
they
say
when
you’re
paying
a
public
school
teacher
out
of
public
school
funds,
he
must
be
used
for
public
school
purposes
and
you
can’t
send
him
to
a
private
school.
the
fiscal
part
of
the
constitution
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
there’s
certainly
no
statute
that
affects
it
in
any
degree
that
i
know
of,
except
the
one
--
maybe
some
statute
on
public
school
funds.
but,
as
i
say,
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
certainly
was
that
there
were
--
on
which
the
handbook
says
--
points
out
in
the
handbook
of
the
office
of
education,
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
was
in
fact
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
sending
a
teacher
into
the
private
school.
and
that
constitutional
provision
that
was
referred
to
that
mr.
justice
read
a
portion
of,
all
of
those
things
were
what
prompted
and
in
the
equities
that
were
consistently
perpetrated
in
this
act
against
private
school
children,
educationally
deprived
private
school
children
in
missouri,
for
these
eight
years
or
seven
years
under
the
act,
all
of
those
things
were
what
prompted
the
court
of
appeals
to
issue
its
--
frame
its
opinion
and
prompted
the
district
judge,
of
course
he
issued
the
mandate
compliance
with
and
that
the
issue
is
in
junction
and
compliance
with
that
mandate
and
properly
so.
and
again
as
it
comeback,
neither
one
of
them
construes
the
act
as
saying
that
it’s
mandatory
under
the
act,
by
the
wording
of
the
act,
to
send
the
teacher
in.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
first
time,
there
was.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
nobody,
the
district
judge
raised
it.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
the
defendants
didn’t
raise
it.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
i
guess
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
the
district
judge
also
raised
it
in
that
same
thing.
he
mentioned
that
we
had
an
exhausted
administrative
remedy,
of
which
there
were
none.
and,
that’s
--
that
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eighth
circuit
on
both
counts.
but,
the
abstention
question
was
not,
as
counsel
suggests,
raised
by
defendants.
the
abstention
question
was
raised
by
the
district
judge
only
and
i
think
clearly
improper
situation,
the
abstention
cases
like
the
alabama
--
excuse
me,
the
alaska
fishing
statute,
things
like
that
where
questions
of
a
--
where
a
state
statute
could
be
interpreted
as
being
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
and,
not
a
question
of
whether
you’re
going
to
implement
properly
the
federal
benefits
provided
by
federal
law.
i
do
want
to
mention
the
constitutional
issue,
of
course,
since
counsel
raised
it
and
goes
into
it.
the
essential
thing
is
that
all
of
the
secular
benefits
to
be
rendered
under
this
act
or
clearly
be
marked,
described,
and
complied
by
the,
if
not
--
not
only
by
the
statute,
but
by
the
regulation.
now
this
is
not,
as
counsel
would
suggest
in
his
brief
again
today,
this
is
not
a
case
of
general
educational
aid
across
the
board,
that’s
not
it
at
all.
this
is
not
a
case
of
just
supplementing
the
private
school
curriculum.
that
is
expressly
forbidden
by
the
act.
the
act
and
the
statute
are
confined
to
special
and
particular
educational
benefits
for
educationally
deprived
children.
they
are
not
designed
as
a
general
aid
to
education
in
non-public
or
public
schools,
either
one,
but
particularly,
in
private
schools,
can
these
benefits
be
used
to
add
to
or
to
replace
and
existing
program.
the
--
i
think
that
is
made
abundantly
clear
throughout.
the
provision
that,
suggested
in
the
brief,
as
to
the
payment
of
private
school
teachers
is
a
--
well,
one
example
suggested
by
the
petitioners
is
without
any
merit
at
all.
they
refer
to
the
handbook
as
giving
authority
to
pay
private
school
teachers.
what
the
handbook
says
is
that
when
private
school
teachers
are
attending
an
“in
service”
training
session,
they
can
get
their
lunch
money
and
their
transportation
money
if
they’re
working
on
title
i
project.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
act
whatsoever.
the
other
portion,
of
course,
if
the
person
is
working
full
time
in
a
private
school,
then
that
person
can
be
teaching
summer
school
under
title
i
program
or
anything
else
can
be
paid
by
the
taking
of
other
employment.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
this
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
aiding
the
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
like
lemon
or
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
thought
you
meant
the
schools
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
--the
program
of
the
schools,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
children
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
just
can’t
give,
and
haven't
been
giving,
the
generally
speaking,
educationally
deprived
children
in
private
or
public
schools.
the
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
it’s
true
that
if
special
educational
benefits
would
be
rendered
to
educationally
deprived
children,
if
the
government
doesn’t
do
it,
somebody
else
will.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
one
of
the
elements.
there
are
--
their
parents
could,
as
the
petitioner
say
here,
as
the
petitioners
say
in
the
record,
that
they
give
them
equal
opportunity
to
participate
by
withdrawing
from
the
private
school
attending
the
public
school
or
coming
after
hours.
those
are
the
two
options
that
were
expressed
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
there
are
several
provisions.
there’s
a
provision
that,
of
course,
these
teachers
remain
strictly
under
public
control
all
the
time.
none
of
the
funds
can
be
used
for
worship
or
religious
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
same
way
they
are
in
the
public
schools.
if
they
have
some
teachers
bootlegging
religion
into
a
title
i
class,
the
public
school
agency
discharges
that
teacher
just
as
they
do
today.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right.
but,
we
don’t
--
mr.
justice,
we
don’t
establish
a
national
system
of
reporting
or
we’re
not
going
to
bug
these
classrooms
i
hope,
mr.
justice,
in
order
to
find
out
and
determine
just
which
teachers
are
sneaking
this
religion
in
to
title
i
classes
or
to
public
school
classes
wherever
they
are.
now,
the
ordinary
--
petitioner’s
brief
talks
about
going
into
the
public
school
classes
and
maintaining
surveillance,
that
isn’t
done
in
any
kind
of
a
routine
basis
in
the
public
school.
we
haven’t
established
any
nation
of
the
case
of
this
court
bakisian
case,
we
don’t
establish
any
particular
orthodoxy
in
our
classrooms
to
which
everybody
must
conform.
the
public
school
teachers,
whether
teaching
in
the
ordinary
public
school
or
title
i
in
a
public
school
or
title
i
special
remedies
in
a
private
school,
they
operate
and
they
do
the
best
they
can.
they’re
human
beings.
i’m
sure
that,
this
moment,
some
public
school
across
this
country,
there
is
somebody
who’s
putting
out
a
little
religion.
but,
we’re
not
--
i
don’t
know
very
much
that
you
and
i
could
do
about
this,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
title
i
teachers
should,
that’s
the
idea
of
it.
and,
it
can
be
--
that
title
i
teacher,
to
my
mind
of
thinking,
can
give
a
sermon
at
his
baptist
church
the
night
before.
he
can
go
to
his
knights
of
columbus
meeting
the
night
before.
he
can
sit
and
watch
television,
as
most
of
them
are
doing
and
never
give
a
thought
to
religion
from
one
day
and
the
next.
and,
that
teacher
could
walk
in
and
give
his
title
i
class
for
remedial
reading
the
next
morning
whether
it’s
in
a
private
school
or
whether
it’s
in
a
public
school
or
whether
it’s
any
place
else
that
the
local
education
agency
might
provide
and
that
is
where
we
say
that
there
is
no
surveillance
of
that
type
required.
in
lemon,
in
dicenso,
what
we’re
concerned
about,
it
seems
to
me,
was
their
words
kept
running
through
the
opinion.
a
dedicated
religious
person,
a
person
deeply
committed
to
her
own
religion
teaching
under
religious
supervision.
those
were
the
phrases
that
i
think
were
in
that
majority
opinion
at
least
four
or
five
times.
and
we’re
not
talking
about,
as
far
as
we
know,
the
dedicated
religious
persons,
we
may
be.
the
public
school
teachers
might
be
dedicated
religious
persons,
i
don’t
know.
but
those
are
their
--
we
don’t
have
that
conflict
that
the
court
saw
in
lemon
that
required
a
surveillance.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
a
much
clearer
case
than
the
allen
case
because,
in
the
allen
case,
at
least
in
two
of
the
dissenting
opinions
seemed
to
be
predicated
on
the
relief
that
these
people
could,
in
private
schools,
could
select
their
own
books
about
historical
events
and
so
forth.
we
don’t
have
that
here.
they
--
the
public
school
agency
selects
that
title
i
teacher,
not
the
private
school
teacher.
there’s
no
religious
test
or
anything
like
that.
so,
i
don’t
think
we
have
any
problem
at
all
under
the
establishment
clause.
i
think
it’s
well
within
the
rule
of
allen
in
that
there’s
--
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
here
about
the
secular
purpose
or
even
the
primary
effect.
i
think
the
congress
anticipated
the
words
of
this
court
set
out
in
norwood
versus
harrison
that
any
program
with
a
legitimate
purpose
that’s
based
between
the
effect
and
the
entanglement
problems
is
constitutional
under
the
establishment
clause
and
that’s
what
the
congress
did
here,
and
that’s
what
the
office
of
education
requires
in
all
of
its
regulations.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
let
me
try
to
outline
our
position
in
this
case
as
it
has
been
from
the
time
we
filed
the
complaint.
we
say
that
the
title
i
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
of
1965
provided
that
comparable
educational
services
for
educationally
deprived
children
relating
to
special
educational
benefits
must
be
provided
on
the
basis
consistent
with
their
number
and
the
extent
of
their
educational
deprivation.
we
say
that
this
had
to
be
done
on
a
comparable
basis
across
the
board
for
public
and
non-public
children
alike.
we
say
that,
in
carrying
this
out,
certain
regulations
were
promulgated
by
the
office
of
education.
we
say
that
this
is
a
federal
law,
funded
entirely
by
federal
funds.
it’s
a
federal
law.
there’s
no
matching
funds,
no
state
funds
of
any
kind.
we
say
that
in
missouri
the
state
board
of
education,
very
early
in
the
game,
took
steps
to
preclude
either
dual
enrollment
or
the
mobile
educational
service
of
sending
the
teacher
in
--
the
public
school
teacher
into
the
private
school.
we
say
that
in
almost
every
situation,
when
the
state
board
precluded
those
two
methods
of
participation
in
the
--
by
the
private
school,
the
private
school
children
could
not,
did
not,
have
not
received
their
fair
equitable,
comparable
participation
in
title
i
benefits.
we
say
that
in
missouri
we
recognize
that
there’s
a
compulsory
attendance
statute
that
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to,
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
has
interpreted
as
to
preclude
dual
enrollment
or
shared
time.
we
say
that
if
we’re
going
to
accommodate
that
decision
and
that
state
law
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggests,
the
only
thing
and
the
only
other
way
that
we
can
receive
comparable
educational
benefits
in
the
private
--
for
the
private
school
children
is
by
sending
the
public
school
title
i
teacher
into
the
private
school
to
teach
the
educationally
deprived
qualified
eligible
non-public
school
children
and
to
give
them
the
title
i
benefits
in
that
fashion.
we
say
generally
that
this
is
constitutional
for
a
number
of
reasons.
we
say
that
the
regulations
in
the
act
have
made
a
provision
that
would
make
it
beyond
and
question,
it
seems
to
me,
affected
by
the
establishment
clause
and
we
say
that
the
relief
directed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
implemented
by
the
injunction
in
the
order
of
the
district
court
is
a
proper,
lawful,
and
clearly
warranted
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
sir?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
not
in
missouri,
mr.
justice,
because
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
think
it
could
be,
certainly.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right,
mr.
justice,
with
reference
to
missouri
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
it
would
be
in
missouri.
that
order
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
mr.
justice.
they
did
not
say
that.
they
said
that
the
act
did
not
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
but
they
did
say
they
were
wrong.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
said
the
act--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
said
the
act
did
not
provide
any
particular
method,
and
i
think
i
can
quote
that,
they
said
the
act
could
not
provide
any
particular
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
“we
further
observe
that
no
particular
program
or
service
is
mandatory
under
the
act.”
they
took
that,
in
that
part
of
their
opinion,
they
analyzed
the
holding
the
statute
and
the
holding
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
they
said
that,
in
missouri,
there
will
not
be
shared
time,
there
will
not
be
dual
enrollment.
we’re
going
to
accommodate
state
law
in
that
respect.
they
found
no
such
law
with
respect
to
sending
public
school
teachers
into
public
schools
of
missouri.
so,
accordingly
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
it
construed
the
act
that
way,
but
only
in
the
sense
and
in
the
background
of
the
evidence
and
facts
presented
to
it.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
in
missouri?
that’s
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
did,
but
as
i
say,
only
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
and
the
background
that
was
presented
to
them
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right.
based
on
that
consideration
-
mr.
thomas
sullivan
--
and
the
further
element
inherent
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
in
the
injunction
that
it
only
applies
or
the
title
i
benefits
are
rendered
on
--
during
regular
school
hours
on
public
school
premises.
now,
there
are
at
least
one
and
perhaps
more
local
educational
agencies,
that
is
the
school
districts
as
we
used
this
term,
in
missouri,
due
to
their
size
or
due
to
their
nature,
do
one
of
two
other
things.
there’s
one
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
there’s
one
that
has
no
title
i
grant
and
they
won’t
request
it
for
reasons
of
their
own.
they’re
a
well-funded
school
district.
they
won’t
request
it
and
they
haven’t
and,
that’s
regardless
of
how
many
educationally
deprived
or
in
the
private
school
there,
in
that
school
district,
they
just--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right
and
the
eligible
or
otherwise
eligible
children
in
private
schools,
they
have
no
right
under
the
act
to
request
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
one
or
two,
yes.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
and
they
have
it.
the
entire
program,
it’s
either
after
hours
or
in
the
summer
time.
there
are
smaller
districts
where
those
programs
seem
to
at
least,
i’m
not
an
educator
but
it
seems,
as
i
understand
it,
they
work
in
those
school
districts.
i
think,
though,
it
is
clear
and
a
court,
the
district
court
in
its
injunction
and
the
court
of
appeals,
excludes
that.
they
don’t
say
that
you
have
private
services
in
private
schools
for
educations
for
our
children
across
the
state.
they
say
all
in
one
is
provided
in
the
public
school
in
missouri
in
light
of
the
compulsory
tenants
there.
now
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
it
only
applies
to
state
board
of
education.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
and
that
was
the
only
--
and
the
commissioner.
those
were
the
only
defendants
on
the
case.
those
were
the
only
ones
sued.
the
--
that
is
the
first
section
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
and
if
that
is
the
meaning
of
it,
of
course,
that
--
if
they’re
saying
that
the
act
does
not
mandate
assignment
of
publicly
employed
teachers
in
--
to
teach
in
religious
schools
during
the
regular
school
hours,
if
they’re
saying
that
the
act
does
not
verbally
or
literally
say
that
you
must
send
in
public
school
teachers
to
teach
in
the
non-public
schools
for
educationally
deprived
children,
we,
of
course
--
that’s
their
own
windmill
that
they’re
charging.
the
court
of
appeals
never
said
that
and
i’ve
never
said
that
and
our
complaint
never
said
that.
the
court
of
appeals
said
just
the
opposite
really.
they
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
as
i
mentioned
before,
it’s
on
page
a26
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
page
1354
of
the
f
2nd
citation.
the
court
of
appeals
says
“we
further
observe
that
no
particular
program
or
service
is
mandatory
under
the
act.”
and
that,
of
course,
is
what
the
congress
intended
and
that’s
what
the
united
states
commissioner
of
office
of
education
intended.
they
presented
outlines
and
methods,
but
no
particular
service
is
mandatory.
then,
they
went
on
to
say,
but
it
granted
these
other
conditions.
in
missouri,
they
must
send
in
title
i
publicly
employed
title
school
--
title
i
teachers
into
the
private
schools.
and
that,
of
course,
is
further
subject
to
the
regulation
that
they
can
teach
of
course
special
educational
subjects
for
eligible
educationally
deprived
children
under
this
essentially
welfare
act,
it
seems
to
me.
but,
furthermore,
they
cannot
teach
any
course
which
is
already
being
taught
in
the
private
school
and
the
regulation
clearly
provides
for
this.
so
it’s
still
a
very
narrow
situation.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
he
should
not
have
abstained
because
we
were
seeking
relief
under
the
federal
acts.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
he
did
but
he
--
well,
let
me
withdraw
that.
in
the
first
instance,
he
did
abstain
and
he
also
held
that,
there,
we
had
an
exhausted
macerated
remedies.
and,
we
had
to
take
that
to
the
eighth
circuit.
and,
of
course,
that
was
reversed
by
the
eighth
circuit
because
in
the
earlier
opinion
they
said
this
is
not
a
case
for
abstention.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
chief
judge
--
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
because
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
because
these
youngsters
were
seeking
their
federally
established
rights.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
we
approve
the
question
of
missouri
law,
but
i
still
think
the
basic
question
was
always
federal
under
title
i
the
title
--
our
rights
under
the
title
i
act.
now,
on
the
abstention
cases
and
the
way
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
decided
those
--
this
case,
under
the
abstention
cases,
never
felt
that
i
can
recall
what
the
federal
statute
--
it
was
first
contrasting
a
state
law
with
the
federal
constitution
and
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
they
would’ve
said
any
one
is
alright,
but
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
still
think
we
would’ve
had
the
same
position
on
the
part
of
the
state
board
of
education.
i
don’t
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
would
have
meant
anything
to
them.
i
still
think
they
would
have
denied
all
the
rights
to
these
private
school
children.
as
they
say
in
their
brief
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
state
board
says
in
their
own
brief,
and
particularly
in
their
reply
brief,
that
it
is
the
state
department
of
education
that
determines
what
the
relevant
state
law
is
and
they’re
the
ones
that
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
think
so.
i
mean,
that’s
what
they
say
in
their
reply
brief.
they
say
they
determined
what
the
applicable
state
law
is.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
would’ve
hope
that
dual
enrollment
would
have
been--
provisions
would’ve
been
made
for
dual
enrollment.
i
would’ve
hoped
that
the
children
could’ve
participated
and
received
their
genuine
opportunities
in
the
language
of
the
guidelines
to
participate
in
comparable
programs.
i
would’ve
hoped
that
was
the
case
if
dual
enrollment
was
included
in
this
one.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
he
--
with
respect
to
dual
enrollment?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
i
don’t
--
if
there
was
a
--
if
dual
enrollment
was
available,
i
mean,
that
would’ve
been
a
maybe
a
little
more
cumbersome
and
awkward
but
certainly
had
been
a
valid
way
to
--
for
these
children
to
receive
their
educational
benefits
and
i
would
hope
that
it
would’ve
been
done.
it
would’ve
been
carried
out
in
the
programs
and
projects.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
mr.
--
judge
lei
in
the
majority
opinion
said
he
hypothesized
a
situation,
if
this
is
i
think
an
answer,
that
on
page
--
i’m
looking
at
the
slip
sheet
23,
a23
in
the
appendix.
he
says
state
law
must
be
accommodated,
but
he
says
suppose
missouri
passed
a
law
that
prevented
it
just
this,
that
no
textbook,
school
books,
title
i
aid,
any
other
bsa
aid,
federal
milk
program
in
the
state
of
missouri
shall
be
prevented
to
go
into
a
private
school
premises
nor
shall
there
be
dual
enrollment.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
there’d
be
no
title
i.
that’s
right
mr.
chief
justice.
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
and
we
have
to
assume
the
existence
of
such
a
law
or
statute,
which
there
is
none.
they
don’t
profess
that
there’s
a
constitutional
article
in
the
state
of
missouri
which
says,
generally,
that
any
federal
program
can
be
--
will
be
accommodated
in
missouri
and
that’s
part
of
missouri
constitution
cited
by
judge
lei
towards
the
latter
part
of
his
opinion.
and,
that
was
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
missouri
constitutional
amendment
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
article
iii
section
38?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
and
so,
i
think
we’ve
obviated
that
situation.
but,
again,
if
there
was
such
a
law,
if
they
just
block
everything,
or
attempt
to
block
it
by
statute,
as
judge
lei
says,
assuming
that
the
equal
protection
problem
would
be
overcome,
there
could
be
no
title
i.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
it
was,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
child
should
stay
in
his
own
school
for
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
so
many
hours
a
day
and
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that
wasn’t
included
in
that
case.
it
was
included
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
only
one
that
was
included
in
that
--
there
was
a
mention
in
that
case
that
public
school
teachers
employed
a
virtue
of
trust
on
it
in
the
opinion,
but
for
public
school
teachers
employed
out
of
missouri
public
school
fund
to
teach
in
public
schools.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
can’t
be
sent
to
private
schools.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
fiscal
elements
of
missouri
constitution.
and,
i
think
that
was
in
that
same
case,
but
only
the
fiscal
elements.
there’s
no
question
--
we
are
the
first
in
the
school
district
of
--
first
amendment
or
anything
else.
they
say
when
you’re
paying
a
public
school
teacher
out
of
public
school
funds,
he
must
be
used
for
public
school
purposes
and
you
can’t
send
him
to
a
private
school.
the
fiscal
part
of
the
constitution
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
yes,
there’s
certainly
no
statute
that
affects
it
in
any
degree
that
i
know
of,
except
the
one
--
maybe
some
statute
on
public
school
funds.
but,
as
i
say,
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
certainly
was
that
there
were
--
on
which
the
handbook
says
--
points
out
in
the
handbook
of
the
office
of
education,
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
was
in
fact
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
sending
a
teacher
into
the
private
school.
and
that
constitutional
provision
that
was
referred
to
that
mr.
justice
read
a
portion
of,
all
of
those
things
were
what
prompted
and
in
the
equities
that
were
consistently
perpetrated
in
this
act
against
private
school
children,
educationally
deprived
private
school
children
in
missouri,
for
these
eight
years
or
seven
years
under
the
act,
all
of
those
things
were
what
prompted
the
court
of
appeals
to
issue
its
--
frame
its
opinion
and
prompted
the
district
judge,
of
course
he
issued
the
mandate
compliance
with
and
that
the
issue
is
in
junction
and
compliance
with
that
mandate
and
properly
so.
and
again
as
it
comeback,
neither
one
of
them
construes
the
act
as
saying
that
it’s
mandatory
under
the
act,
by
the
wording
of
the
act,
to
send
the
teacher
in.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
first
time,
there
was.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
nobody,
the
district
judge
raised
it.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
the
defendants
didn’t
raise
it.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
i
guess
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
the
district
judge
also
raised
it
in
that
same
thing.
he
mentioned
that
we
had
an
exhausted
administrative
remedy,
of
which
there
were
none.
and,
that’s
--
that
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eighth
circuit
on
both
counts.
but,
the
abstention
question
was
not,
as
counsel
suggests,
raised
by
defendants.
the
abstention
question
was
raised
by
the
district
judge
only
and
i
think
clearly
improper
situation,
the
abstention
cases
like
the
alabama
--
excuse
me,
the
alaska
fishing
statute,
things
like
that
where
questions
of
a
--
where
a
state
statute
could
be
interpreted
as
being
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
and,
not
a
question
of
whether
you’re
going
to
implement
properly
the
federal
benefits
provided
by
federal
law.
i
do
want
to
mention
the
constitutional
issue,
of
course,
since
counsel
raised
it
and
goes
into
it.
the
essential
thing
is
that
all
of
the
secular
benefits
to
be
rendered
under
this
act
or
clearly
be
marked,
described,
and
complied
by
the,
if
not
--
not
only
by
the
statute,
but
by
the
regulation.
now
this
is
not,
as
counsel
would
suggest
in
his
brief
again
today,
this
is
not
a
case
of
general
educational
aid
across
the
board,
that’s
not
it
at
all.
this
is
not
a
case
of
just
supplementing
the
private
school
curriculum.
that
is
expressly
forbidden
by
the
act.
the
act
and
the
statute
are
confined
to
special
and
particular
educational
benefits
for
educationally
deprived
children.
they
are
not
designed
as
a
general
aid
to
education
in
non-public
or
public
schools,
either
one,
but
particularly,
in
private
schools,
can
these
benefits
be
used
to
add
to
or
to
replace
and
existing
program.
the
--
i
think
that
is
made
abundantly
clear
throughout.
the
provision
that,
suggested
in
the
brief,
as
to
the
payment
of
private
school
teachers
is
a
--
well,
one
example
suggested
by
the
petitioners
is
without
any
merit
at
all.
they
refer
to
the
handbook
as
giving
authority
to
pay
private
school
teachers.
what
the
handbook
says
is
that
when
private
school
teachers
are
attending
an
“in
service”
training
session,
they
can
get
their
lunch
money
and
their
transportation
money
if
they’re
working
on
title
i
project.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
act
whatsoever.
the
other
portion,
of
course,
if
the
person
is
working
full
time
in
a
private
school,
then
that
person
can
be
teaching
summer
school
under
title
i
program
or
anything
else
can
be
paid
by
the
taking
of
other
employment.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no,
this
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
aiding
the
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
like
lemon
or
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
thought
you
meant
the
schools
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
--the
program
of
the
schools,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
children
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
no
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
they
just
can’t
give,
and
haven't
been
giving,
the
generally
speaking,
educationally
deprived
children
in
private
or
public
schools.
the
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well,
it’s
true
that
if
special
educational
benefits
would
be
rendered
to
educationally
deprived
children,
if
the
government
doesn’t
do
it,
somebody
else
will.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
one
of
the
elements.
there
are
--
their
parents
could,
as
the
petitioner
say
here,
as
the
petitioners
say
in
the
record,
that
they
give
them
equal
opportunity
to
participate
by
withdrawing
from
the
private
school
attending
the
public
school
or
coming
after
hours.
those
are
the
two
options
that
were
expressed
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
well
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
there
are
several
provisions.
there’s
a
provision
that,
of
course,
these
teachers
remain
strictly
under
public
control
all
the
time.
none
of
the
funds
can
be
used
for
worship
or
religious
--
mr.
thomas
sullivan
the
same
way
they
are
in
the
public
schools.
if
they
have
some
teachers
bootlegging
religion
into
a
title
i
class,
the
public
school
agency
discharges
that
teacher
just
as
they
do
today.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
sullivan
that’s
right.
but,
we
don’t
--
mr.
justice,
we
don’t
establish
a
national
system
of
reporting
or
we’re
not
going
to
bug
these
classrooms
i
hope,
mr.
justice,
in
order
to
find
out
and
determine
just
which
teachers
are
sneaking
this
religion
in
to
title
i
classes
or
to
public
school
classes
wherever
they
are.
now,
the
ordinary
--
petitioner’s
brief
talks
about
going
into
the
public
school
classes
and
maintaining
surveillance,
that
isn’t
done
in
any
kind
of
a
routine
basis
in
the
public
school.
we
haven’t
established
any
nation
of
the
case
of
this
court
bakisian
case,
we
don’t
establish
any
particular
orthodoxy
in
our
classrooms
to
which
everybody
must
conform.
the
public
school
teachers,
whether
teaching
in
the
ordinary
public
school
or
title
i
in
a
public
school
or
title
i
special
remedies
in
a
private
school,
they
operate
and
they
do
the
best
they
can.
they’re
human
beings.
i’m
sure
that,
this
moment,
some
public
school
across
this
country,
there
is
somebody
who’s
putting
out
a
little
religion.
but,
we’re
not
--
i
don’t
know
very
much
that
you
and
i
could
do
about
this,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
title
i
teachers
should,
that’s
the
idea
of
it.
and,
it
can
be
--
that
title
i
teacher,
to
my
mind
of
thinking,
can
give
a
sermon
at
his
baptist
church
the
night
before.
he
can
go
to
his
knights
of
columbus
meeting
the
night
before.
he
can
sit
and
watch
television,
as
most
of
them
are
doing
and
never
give
a
thought
to
religion
from
one
day
and
the
next.
and,
that
teacher
could
walk
in
and
give
his
title
i
class
for
remedial
reading
the
next
morning
whether
it’s
in
a
private
school
or
whether
it’s
in
a
public
school
or
whether
it’s
any
place
else
that
the
local
education
agency
might
provide
and
that
is
where
we
say
that
there
is
no
surveillance
of
that
type
required.
in
lemon,
in
dicenso,
what
we’re
concerned
about,
it
seems
to
me,
was
their
words
kept
running
through
the
opinion.
a
dedicated
religious
person,
a
person
deeply
committed
to
her
own
religion
teaching
under
religious
supervision.
those
were
the
phrases
that
i
think
were
in
that
majority
opinion
at
least
four
or
five
times.
and
we’re
not
talking
about,
as
far
as
we
know,
the
dedicated
religious
persons,
we
may
be.
the
public
school
teachers
might
be
dedicated
religious
persons,
i
don’t
know.
but
those
are
their
--
we
don’t
have
that
conflict
that
the
court
saw
in
lemon
that
required
a
surveillance.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
a
much
clearer
case
than
the
allen
case
because,
in
the
allen
case,
at
least
in
two
of
the
dissenting
opinions
seemed
to
be
predicated
on
the
relief
that
these
people
could,
in
private
schools,
could
select
their
own
books
about
historical
events
and
so
forth.
we
don’t
have
that
here.
they
--
the
public
school
agency
selects
that
title
i
teacher,
not
the
private
school
teacher.
there’s
no
religious
test
or
anything
like
that.
so,
i
don’t
think
we
have
any
problem
at
all
under
the
establishment
clause.
i
think
it’s
well
within
the
rule
of
allen
in
that
there’s
--
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
here
about
the
secular
purpose
or
even
the
primary
effect.
i
think
the
congress
anticipated
the
words
of
this
court
set
out
in
norwood
versus
harrison
that
any
program
with
a
legitimate
purpose
that’s
based
between
the
effect
and
the
entanglement
problems
is
constitutional
under
the
establishment
clause
and
that’s
what
the
congress
did
here,
and
that’s
what
the
office
of
education
requires
in
all
of
its
regulations.
mr.
thomas
sullivan
thank
you.
