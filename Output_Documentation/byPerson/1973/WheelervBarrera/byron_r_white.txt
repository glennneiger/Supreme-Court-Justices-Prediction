dual

where
the
classes
on
the
private

on
the
public

property
would
never
be

justice
byron

no,
under
the

forget
missouri.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
by
definition,
the
class
is
carried
on
on
public
school
property
and
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
if
these
services
are
furnished
by
teachers
on
public
school
property
during
school
hours,
it
must
be
furnished
on
the
--
be
made
available
on

property
during
school
hours.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
dual
enrollment
program
would
never
be
sufficient?
justice
byron
r.
white
forget
missouri,
they
said
the
act
required
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i’ll
put
it
to
you
this
way.
if
they
did
say
it,
they
were
wrong.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
that’s
all
i
need.
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
put
state
law
aside
for
the
moment.
did
the
court
of
appeals
construe
the
federal
act
as
requiring,
because
it
required
comparable
training?
did
it
construe
the
federal
act
as
meaning
that
if
certain
programs
are
carried
on
in
public
schools
during
school
hours,
that
comparable
programs
must
be
carried
on
--
be
made
available
to
the
private
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that’s
alright,
but
nevertheless,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
local
educational
agency
in
missouri,
if
it’s
going
to
furnish
a
program
on
public
school
property,
must
furnish
a
like
program
on
private
school
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
be
true
anywhere,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
--
at
least
they
construed
the
act
in
this
case
to
require
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
namely,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
enrollment
was
permissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
injunction
that
would’ve
been
entered
was
cease
disapproving
any
program
that
provides
either
for
dual
enrollment
or
furnishing
on
private
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
injunction
that
was
entered
here,
that
was
order
entered
by
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
the
state
agency
to
quit
disapproving
programs
or
that
suggested
furnishing
services
on
private
school
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
went
the
other
way.
the
court
of
appeals'
injunction
would
simply
as
the
chief
justice
widened
the
options.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
the
state
constitutional
matter,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
an
issue
under
the
state
constitution
as
to
whether
this
missouri
law
barred
all
of
these
programs?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
wheeler
decision
that
barred
dual
enrollment
was
a
statutory
construction
matter,
wasn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
a
matter
of
saying
that
the
state’s
compulsory
attendance
laws
required
--
justice
byron
r.
white
stay
in
his
own
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
would
be
in
another
different
question
as
to
whether
a
public
school
teacher
could
be
sent
into
a
private
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
were
a
case
in
missouri
about
sending
public
school
teachers
into
private
schools,
the
argument
would
be
based
on,
what,
the
missouri
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
still
would
be
a
constitutional
construction
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
issue
of
abstention
raised
in
the
district
court,
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was,
and
who
raised
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
neither
the
defendants
--
the
defendants
didn’t
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
argument
for
abstention
is
that
you
should
await
a
state
court
construction
of
its
constitution
in
order
to
avoid
a
federal
statutory
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
got
to,
was
the
federal
statutory
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
the
people
on
the
local
educational
agencies
payroll?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
next
sentence,
mr.
friedman?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
claim
is
that
the
state
shouldn’t
have
to
respond
to
an
injunction
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
part
of
the
issue
is
whether
comparability
as
used
in
the
act
requires
that
the
programs
be
furnished
on
the
premise
that
private
schools
if
they
are
furnished
on
the
premises
of
the
public
schools,
that’s
part
of
the
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
injunction
that
was
issued
in
compliance
with
the
mandate
was
consistent
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pfeffer,
do
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
under
the
wheeler
case
in
the
missouri
courts
that
dual
enrollment
is
not
consistent
with
the
state
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
not
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
asking
you
what’s
your
position,
here,
in
this
court
as
to
what
state
law
is
on
dual
enrollment?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn’t
what
i
ask
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
ask
you
about
dual
enrollment.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pfeffer,
i
ask
you
whether
you
agreed
with
that,
that
under
the
wheeler
case
dual
enrollment
had
been
outlawed
under
a
state
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
contrary
to
state
law
whether
it’s
contrary
to
state
constitution
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
that
under
the
state
constitution
both
forms
are
forbidden?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
it
does
bring
in
under
the
spotlight
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
you
were
going
to
abstain
then,
i
would
suppose
that
under
this
and
if
you
agree
that
state
statute
bars
dual
enrollment,
then
you
really
are
up
against
a
federal
constitutional
question
of
the
--
and
which
is
what
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
your
position
that
you
are
up
against
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
dual
enrollment
would
never
be
sufficient
--
justice
byron
r.
white
dual
enrollment
where
the
classes
on
the
private

property
would
