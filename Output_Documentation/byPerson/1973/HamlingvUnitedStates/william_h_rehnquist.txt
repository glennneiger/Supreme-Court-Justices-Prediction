justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
hamling
versus
the
united
states,
the
petitioners
were
convicted
of
mailing
and
conspiring
to
mail
an
obscene
advertising
brochure
with
sexually
explicit
photographic
material
relating
to
their
illustrated
version
of
an
official
report
on
obscenity
in
violation
of
provisions
of
the
united
states
criminal
code.
the
indictment
under
section
1461
charged
petitioners
in
the
language
of
the
statute
which
prohibits
the
act
whoever
knowingly
uses
the
mails
for
the
mailing
of
anything
declared
by
this
section
to
be
non-mailable.
the
jury
was
unable
to
reach
a
verdict
on
the
counts
charging
the
mailing
of
the
allegedly
obscene
illustrated
report
itself,
but
it
did
find
petitioners
guilty
of
violations
of
statute
in
circulating
the
brochure
through
the
mails.
following
affirmance
of
the
convictions
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
this
court
decided
miller
versus
california
last
june
and
in
the
companion
cases.
the
court
of
appeals
thereafter
denied
a
petition
for
rehearing
based
on
its
consideration
of
those
cases.
we
granted
petitioner's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
petitioners
challenge
their
convictions
based
upon
the
pre-miller
obscenity
test
in
memoirs
versus
massachusetts
and
also
because
they
claim
it
fails
to
meet
the
standards
laid
down
in
the
miller
cases
last
year.
they
also
challenge
various
procedural
and
evidentiary
rulings
of
the
district
court
and
certain
of
its
instructions.
in
a
50-page
opinion
filed
today
which
i
will
only
summarize,
we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
first
that
1461
was
not
unconstitutionally
vague
as
applied
to
petitioner's
pre-miller
conduct.
the
jury's
determination
that
the
brochure
was
obscene
was
supported
by
the
evidence
and
was
consistent
with
the
memoirs
obscenity
formulation.
in
addition,
we
hold
that
the
standards
of
obscenity
established
in
the
miller
cases
are
to
be
applied
to
petitioner's
pre-miller
conduct,
that
in
applying
these
standards,
we
hold
they
do
not
require
the
reversal
of
petitioner's
convictions.
we
similarly
reject
petitioner's
contentions
directed
at
various
procedural
and
evidentiary
rulings
of
the
district
court.
