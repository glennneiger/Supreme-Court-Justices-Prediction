justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
us
see,
mr.
greenberg.
that's
to
argue,
i
gather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
to
argue,
i
gather,
that
this
statute
should
be
read
as
if
congress
had
said
and
these
cases
shall
be
tried
by
a
judge
without
a
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
even
if
this
made
--
is
a
common
law
action,
even
if
it
is,
that
since
that
provision
that
was
enacted
by
the
congress
under
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment,
as
you
suggest,
the
five
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
then
necessarily
that
overrides
any
requirement
of
the
seventh
amendment
for
a
jury
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
not
argue,
in
that
instance,
if
it
is
a
common
law
action
that
the
authority
of
the
congress
under
sections
2
of
the
thirteenth
and
5
of
the
fourteenth
can
override
even
the
seventh
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
why
i
[laughter
attempt]
i
really
don't
understand
why
you
are
so
hesitant
about
urging
on
this
that,
if
this
--
to
the
extent
the
statute
rests
on
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
that
the
congressional
power
under
sections
2
and
5
respectively
can
even
go
so
far
as
to
overwrite.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
this
is
an
--
in
the
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
are
the
(voice

labor
act
is
adapted
strictly
in
pursuit
of
the
commerce
power.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
on
(voice
overlap)
--
let's
assume
congress
said
it
is
a
statutory
right
to
pursue
the
congress
--
the
commerce
power.
congress
says
no
jury
trials
and
suits
on
collective
bargaining
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
perhaps
(inaudible)
since
you're
not
making
any
(inaudible).
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you
don't
rather
not
make.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
an
don't
you
--
i
suppose
it's
also
true,
mr.
greenberg,
isn't
it
that
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
came
after
the
adaption
of
the
seventh?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
commerce
clause
preceded
the
adaption
of
the
seventh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
might.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
filed?
the
original
complaint
seek
injunctive
relief
initially?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
through
a
formal
amendment
to
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
a
rule
16.
we'll
resume
there
at
10:00
tomorrow
morning.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
greenberg,
are
there
any
counterparts
for
a
single
integrated
equitable
remedy,
as
you
style
it,
that
includes
authorization
to
the
chancellor
to
award
actual
damages
and
punitive
damages?
is
there
any
other
statute
like
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
ordinarily,
do
--
in
--
does
the
chancellor
award
punitive
damages?
and
when
dealing
with
equitable
actions
where
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
question
is,are
you
familiar
with
any
other
equitable
action,
which
is
what
you
stylist
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
labeled
punitive
damages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
more
nearly
a
fine,
aren't
they?
justice
