justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happened
to
the
preliminary
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
the
record?
i
missed
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
the
record?
i
missed
it.
is
that
in
the
appendix?
well,
but
say
i
can
find
it
but
i
just
--
i
guess
i
missed
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
is
in
the
record,
i
can
find
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
a
permanent
injunction
had
been
issued
in
this
case,
would
you
still
take
the
same
position
on
the
damage
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you'd
have
to
have
two
full
trials?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they'd
be
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
asking
would
they
be
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
the
evidence,
the
testimony,
the
record
be
different
in
the
injunction
case
where
permanent
injunction
was
issued
and
the
trial
on
the
damage
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
the
issue
not
be
exactly
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
have
two
trials?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
wait
a
minute
now.
you
asked
for
an
injunction,
a
permanent
injunction
and
1,000
punitive
damages
and
actual
damages.
there
is
a
full
trial,
a
full
hearing
before
the
judge
sitting
as
a
chancellor,
and
he
grants
a
permanent
injunction.
is
it
your
position
that
after
that
he
holds
a
new
trial
with
the
jury
to
determine
the
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
section
812
then
--
you
say
section
812
says
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
section
812
is
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
says
there
that
the
court
may
award
the
plaintiff
the
actual
damages
in
addition
to
the
temporary
injunction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
in
order
to
--
for
it
to
be
constitutional
it
would
have
to
include
the
jury.
if
it
didn't
include
the
jury,
it'd
be
unconstitutional.
isn't
that
not
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit.
the
case
was
brought
a
negro
woman,
who
under
section
812
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968,
in
which
she
claimed
that
the
defendants
had
refused
to
rent
an
apartment
to
her
on
account
of
her
race.
the
defendants
requested
a
jury
trial,
but
this
request
was
denied,
and
the
trial
judge
without
a
jury
found
that
they
had
indeed
discriminated
against
the
plaintiff
and
awarded
her
punitive
damages.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
a
jury
trial
was
required
in
this
action.
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
we
hold
that
the
seventh
amendment
entitles
either
party
to
demand
a
jury
trail
in
actions
for
damages
under
this
particular
section
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968.
