mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
what
is
involved
is
the
effectiveness
of
title
8
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
which
assures
fair
housing
to
all
americans
without
regard
to
race,
color,
national
origin,
or
religion.
the
effectiveness
of
the
act
is
threatened
in
this
case
by
a
claim
that
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
prohibits
congress
from
providing
that
civil
actions
under
the
act
be
tried
by
the
court
and
not
by
a
jury.
we
submit
that
the
court
trial
and
remedy
provisions
of
title
8
are
constitutional
as
within
the
power
of
congress
granted
by
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
seventh
amendment
preserving
jury
trials
in
suits
that
common
law
is
not
applicable
to
litigation
under
title
8.
briefly,
the
facts
of
the
case
or
that
petitioner
who
was
black,
while
a
patient
in
a
hospital
in
november
1969,
asked
a
white
friend
to
find
an
apartment
for
her.
the
friend
found
an
apartment
owned
by
respondents
and
it
appeared
that
a
lease
would
be,
or
perhaps
even
was,
consummated
with
respondents’
agent.
but
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
petitioner
was
black,
they
refused
to
go
through
with
the
deal.
the
district
court
found,
and
it
is
supported
in
the
record,
that
petitioner
was
denied
the
apartment
because
of
her
race.
the
court
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
on
november
17,
1969
ordering
respondents
not
to
rent
the
apartment
to
anyone
else
pending
resolution
of
the
dispute
and
then
did
a
preliminary
injunction
on
december
19
to
the
same
general
effect.
and
the
court
urged
both
parties
to
try
to
settle
the
dispute,
but
this
turned
out
to
be
impossible
and
efforts
to
conciliate
went
on
over
a
period
of
six
months.
and
more
than
six
months
after
the
action
had
commenced,
petitioner
could
no
longer
wait
for
the
case
to
be
concluded
and
took
another
apartment.
her
counsel
withdrew
the
application
for
an
order
directing
that
the
apartment
be
rented
to
her
though
went
on
with
other
aspects
of
the
case
and
asked
for
punitive
damages,
costs,
and
counsel
fees.
following
trial,
the
court
made
an
award
of
$250
in
punitive
damages
but
denied
counsel
fees
and
costs.
weighing
on
the
one
hand
the
importance
of
petitioner’s
rights
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
fact
that
the
respondent
had
been
denied
rent
for
the
apartment
during
the
period
the
case
was
before
the
court.
the
respondents
urged
in
the
district
court
that
the
case
should
have
been
heard
by
a
jury,
but
the
district
court
rejected
this
contention.
respondents
renewed
this
claim
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
we
submit
that
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
that
it
will
seriously
impair
the
effectiveness
of
title
viii.
that
it
involves
a
misreading
of
the
plain
unequivocal
language
of
title
viii
and
of
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
the
fair
housing
act
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
is
wrong
concerning
the
requirements
of
the
seventh
amendment.
at
this
point
of
the
litigation,
there
no
longer
seems
to
be
any
serious
dispute
between
the
parties
concerning
the
language
of
title
viii.
respondents
in
their
brief
offer
at
best
a
cursory
argument
that
the
statute
is
unclear
and
put
to
this
court
as
the
only
question
presented
whether
the
seventh
amendment
requires
jury
trials
in
title
viii
cases.
in
resolving
the
issues
before
the
court,
we
submit
that
we
should
first
look
at
the
statutory
language.
the
provisions
which
we
are
construing,
section
812
(c),
provides
that
“the
ourt”
shall
grant
relief
and
it
uses
the
word
“court”
in
that
subsection
as
well
as
elsewhere
in
the
statute
in
a
variety
of
ways
which
can
only
mean
“judge”
and
“judge
acting
without
a
jury.”
for
example,
the
statute
speaks
of
the
court
granting
permanent
or
temporary
injunctions
or
temporary
restraining
orders
and
of
awarding
costs.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
helps
me
a
great
deal
because
the
word
“court,”
we
submit,
is
used
consistently
throughout
the
statute.
and
if
the
word
“court”
is
used
in
connection
with
injunctions
and
counsel
fees
and
continuances
and
conciliation
and
in
several
other
contexts,
we
submit
that
within
a
single
section
the
word
“court,”
whenever
it
refers
to
damages,
means
the
same
as
the
word
“court”
in
all
those
other
connections.
we
submit
the
word
had
to
have
been
used
consistently.
indeed,
the
word
“court”
not
only
in
this
statute
but
throughout
the
entire
federal
code
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
consistently
invariably
means
court
and
judge
acting
without
a
jury.
when
the
congress
intends
to
use
the
term
“jury,”
it
knows
how
to
do
so
and
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
citation
of
a
large
number
of
statutes
in
which
congress
said
that
certain
issues
that
it
would
be
drive
by
a
jury
and
not
by
the
court.
and,
indeed,
in
this
record
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
is
the
next
question.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
first
point
in
our
argument
that
this
is
(inaudible),
that
this
is
mode
of
procedure
which
has
been
prescribed
by
congress.
and
that
the
prescription
by
congress
of
this
mode
of
procedure
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
is
entitled
to
great
weight
indeed,
as
even
controlling
in
this
case.
and
i
first
wanted
to
make
absolutely
unequivocally
clear
that
this
indeed,
is
what
congress
has
done.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
not
quite
certain
i
would
carry
that
--
my
argument
that
far
and
i
don't
have
to
carry
my
argument
that
far
because
our
next
point
is
that
this
is
not
a
common
law
action
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it'd
never
be
a
common
law
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
it
is
a
common
law
action,
i
think
we
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
case
and
we
would
have
to
then
look
at
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
not
certain
that
i
would,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
certainly
don't
have
to
in
this
case.
i
would
look
at
--
whether
the
--
i
would
look
at
the
equitable
quality
of
the
action
of
what
the
role
of
the
jury
would
be,
how
difficult
it
is
for
the
jury
to
decide
the
case,
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
might
argue
it,
but
i
certainly
do
not
have
to
and
i
am
not
going
to.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
in
fact,
i
think
probably
the
commerce
block
--
power
was
invoked
and
the
statute
does
in
part
rest
upon
it.
in
fact,
i'm
certain
the
statute
does
in
part,
rest
upon
the
commerce
power.
but
it
rests
upon
a
specific
constitutional
directives
to
implement
two
particulars
of
amendments
regarding
a
very
important
factor
in
american
life
to
which
the
congress
is
directing
itself.
the
commerce
power
is
more
diffused
by
but
i
would
say
the
commerce
power
would
be
adequate
and
it
has
involved
it.
just
going
beyond
my
effort
to
establish
that
they
made
court
and
court
acting
without
a
jury,
the
fair
housing
act
originally
was
a
part
of
a
1966
civil
rights
bill.
and
in
that
act
--
in
that
bill,
there
was
the
fair
housing
act
and
there
was
the
jury
selection
act
--
jury
selection
bill
which
later
became
the
jury
selection
act
of
1968.
in
that
single
piece
of
legislation,
congress
used
the
word
“court”
and
“jury”
in
juxtaposition
dealing
with
jury
selection,
and
then
used
the
word
“court”
in
dealing
with
fair
housing.
it'd
be
quite
strange
whether
in
a
single
piece
of
legislation,
which
later
they
--
then
was
enact
--
two
parts
of
which
were
enacted
two
weeks
apart
in
1968
with
terms
given
to
it
used
differently.
but
i
will
go
beyond
that
part
of
the
argument.
i
will
submit
that
the
congress
meant
court
and
it
meant
court
acting
without
a
jury.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
it
would
be
very
difficult.
one
would
then
have
to
look
at
some
of
the
other
attributes
of
the
action
and
see
whether
or
not,
for
example
as
mentioned
in
the
footnote
against
ross
versus
bernhard,
this
is
an
action
in
which
juries
might
have
particular
difficulty
in
coming
to
a
decision
or
whether
as
in
the
katchen
case
for
example,
whether
there
was
some
need
for
particular
expedition
in
the
action
and
so
forth.
but,
we
do
not
have
any
of
that
here.
in
fact,
this
case
--
in
--
the
only
cases
that
we're
aware
of,
in
fact,
in
which
congress
had
--
in
which
this
court
has
passed
upon
the
power
of
congress
to
require
enforcement
of
statutes
which
it
had
enacted
by
court
sitting
without
juries
are
nlrb
against
jones
and
laughlin
steel,
and
katchen
against
landy.
in
nlrb
against
jones
and
laughlin
steel,
this
court
held
that
backpay
and
other
monetary
awards
might
be
made
by
the
nlrb
and
enforced
by
the
court
of
appeals
without
intervention
by
a
jury
because
the
right
involved
did
not
exist
at
common
law.
in
katchen,
the
court
held
that
adjudication
of
the
validity
of
a
preference
in
summary
proceedings
under
the
bankruptcy
act
also
might
be
made
sitting
by
a
court
without
a
jury
and
the
decision
in
that
case,
as
i
understand
it,
rested
upon
the
fact
that
congress
determ
--
had
determined
the
need
for
speed
and
efficiency
in
the
essentially
equitable
nature
of
bankruptcy.
this
case
is
like
nlrb
against
jones
and
laughlin,
and
katchen
v.
landy
in
that
we
have
a
congressional
determination
that
the
case
shall
be
heard
by
the
court
and
not
by
a
jury.
it
is
further
like
the
nlrb
and
jones
and
laughlin
case
in
that
it
involves
a
new
congressionally
created
right.
and,
it's
like
katchen
in
that
there
is
a
special
need
for
speed
and
effectiveness
of
relief
which
would
be
impaired
by
jury
trial.
the
seventh
amendment
is
applicable
only
to
suits
at
common
law.
this
is
not
a
suit
at
common
law.
neither
in
1791
nor
for
a
century-and-a
half
thereafter
could
a
plaintiff
such
as
petitioner
have
brought
an
action
in
england
or
in
any
state
of
the
union
to
compel
a
landlord
not
to
discriminate
against
her
in
the
basis
of
race.
indeed,
throughout
most
of
this
period,
the
common
law
set
the
full
force
of
its
power
against
people
like
petitioners
and
behind
landlords
and
sellers
of
real
property
who
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
now,
against
this
congressional
decision
and
the
fact
that
the
cause
of
action
enforced
in
this
case
was
unknown
at
common
law
respondent
cites
the
three
cases,
and
the
court
of
appeals
does
to,
of
beacon
theatres,
dairy
queen,
and
ross
against
bernhard.
but
these
cases
first
did
not
involve
congressional
statutes.
they
involved
mixed,
legal,
and
equitable
claims
concerning
which
some
judicial
rule
was
necessary
as
to
whether
the
court
should
heard
be
--
whether
the
case
should
be
heard
by
a
judge
or
a
jury
without
regard
to
the
adventitiousness
of
who
first
commenced
the
action
or
what
it
was
characterized
as.
in
beacon,
if
the
defendant
had
filed
before
the
plaintiff,
the
jury
clearly
would
have
been
required.
in
dairy
cream
--
queen,
if
the
form
of
action
had
been
characterized
as
one
for
damages
rather
than
accounting,
a
jury
trial
would
have
not
been
disputed.
in
ross
against
bernhard,
if
the
corporation
itself
had
brought
the
action
instead
of
the
action
being
brought
on
the
form
of
stockholders
derivative
suit,
there
would've
been
no
question
that
a
jury
would
have
been
appropriate.
we
submit
that
while
there
is
seventh
amendment
language
in
these
decisions,
all
they
really
stand
for
is
that
the
substance
of
the
action
and
not
the
form
are
determinative
of
whether
the
case
should
be
heard
by
the
court
alone
or
with
the
jury.
the
statutory
right
claimed
by
petitioner
in
this
case
is
one
which
never
could
have
been
enforced
at
common
law
at
any
time,
in
any
place,
in
any
way.
moreover
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
may
be
that
there
is
some
analogy
or
there
is
a
statutory
counterpart
of
some
sort
of
a
common
law
right.
but
this
is
something
which
even
today,
apart
from
the
fact
of
race,
there
is
no
such
right
as
this.
if
a
would-be
buyer
goes
to
a
seller
and
the
seller
says,
“i
just
do
not
want
to
sell
to
you,”
there
is
nothing
anyone
can
do
about
it
unless
he
says
“i
do
not
want
to
sell
to
you
because
of
your
race.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
think
it's
a
whole
new
kind
of
right
which
indeed
was
enacted
after
a
very
considerable
congressional
struggle
in
which
the
debate
was
that
this
is
overturning
rights
of
sellers
and
owners
unknown
to
the
common
--
as
known
by
the
common
law.
but
in
any
event,
mr.
justice
white,
if
one
were
to
apply
the
seventh
amendment
to
this
case,
it
would
be
because
there
is
to
be
--
there
is
some
analogical
extension
of
some
sort
of
a
common
law
right
which
it
is
held
ought
to
be
protected
or
enforced
by
means
of
the
seventh
amendment.
on
the
other
hand,
as
compeer
to
that
analogical
extension,
we
have
the
direct
decision
of
congress
that
the
rights
secured
by
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
are
best
enforced
by
trials
conducted
in
this
kind
of
way
because
they're
more
expeditious.
it
removes
community
prejudice
from
the
proceedings
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
will
say
it
certainly
goes
so
far
as
to
overwrite
any
common
law
right
that
is
extended
by
--
that
is
created
by
analogic
extension
and
that's
all
i
have
to
say.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
the
nlrb
is
involved,
it
certainly
isn't.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it's
a
contract.
it's
a
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
contract
or
for
to
enforce
a
contract.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
it
is
a
common
law
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
commerce
clause
is
a
clause
which
gives
the
congress
power
to
enact
legislation
in
any
variety
of
directions.
under
the
commerce
clause
the
congress
can
enforce
or
refuse
to
enforce
or
deal
in
an
infinite
number
of
ways
with
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
express
very
positive
policies
concerning
racial
equality
which
congress
is
implementing
so
it's
a
rather
different
thing.
one
is
enforcing
the
policies
of
the
amendments.
the
other
is
merely
acting
under
authority
granted
by
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
it's
a
rather
different
situation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
--
well,
first
of
all,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
are
in
no
way
challenging
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
we
are
in
no
way
in
this
case
questioning
the
right
of
trial
by
jury.
in
criminal
cases,
we
are
no
way
in
this
case
questioning
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
in
what
might
--
one
one
might
call
fundamental
common
law
cases
or
their
modern
counterparts
or
reasonable
analogies
thereto.
with
regard
to
the
last
series
of
questions,
i
would
say
that,
to
the
extent
that
one
would
seek
to
find
some
analogy
in
the
common
law
to
what
is
done
in
the
fair
housing
act
and
thereby
advanced
the
constitutional
policies
of
the
seventh
amendment.
one
must
put
that
as
against
the
very
positive
policies
of
the
thirteenth
and
fouteenth
amendment
which
are
quite
different
i
would
submit,
mr.--
mr.
jack
greenberg
they're
entirely
more
than
--
they're
entirely
different
than
the
commerce
clause.
the
commerce
clause
is
a
power
to
enact
legislation
in
a
total
varie
--
under
the
commerce
clause,
presumably
back
to
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
one
might
be
able
to
enact
the
statute
saying
that
whites
do
not
have
to
sell
to
blacks.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh!
i
think,
without
a
doubt,
there
is.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
if
i
started
down
that
line
i
might
prove
a
little
too
much.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
in
summary,
all
we
say
is
that
where
congress
is
enforcing
the
cherished
values
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
by
proceedings
unknown
to
the
common
law
and
decides
that
the
cause
shall
be
determined
by
the
court
and
not
by
a
jury,
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
require
trial
by
jury.
and,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
that
in
title
8
congress
has
created
a
single
integrated
equitable
remedy,
out
of
which
a
court
might
fashion
relief
appropriate
to
particular
cases.
that
remedy
consists
of
various
parts.
statute
says
the
court
may
issue
temporary
restraining
orders,
preliminary
injunctions,
may
appoint
counsel,
may
foster
conciliation,
may
award
compensatory
damages,
may
award
punitive
damages,
may
award
costs,
and
may
award
counsel
fees
or
all
or
none
of
them.
now,
the
fact
that
money
damages
is
part
of
it,
the
entire
remedy
does
not
necessarily
make
it
legal
as
jones
&
laughlin
demonstrates.
a
judge
is
suppose
to
pick
and
choose
among
these
various
aspects
of
the
remedy
and
harmonize
them
in
a
manner
appropriate
to
the
case.
and
it's
instructive
to
look
at
just
what
the
judge
did
in
this
particular
case.
he
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order.
he
granted
a
preliminary
injunction.
he
urged
settlement
discussions
which
went
on
for
many
months.
so
long,
in
fact,
that
mrs.
rogers
had
to
take
a
new
apartment.
he
denied
compensatory
damages.
he
granted
punitive
damages
and
in
doing
that,
he
took
into
account
the
fact
that
the
respondent
had
been
denied
rent
for
the
apartment
for
a
period
of
6
months.
he
denied
attorney
fees
and
he
denied
costs.
he
engaged
in
the
typical
kind
of
balancing
that
a
chancellor
engages
in
and,
indeed,
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
had
had
a
very
difficult
case
before
him
and
it
would
take
as
--
he
said,
the
wisdom
of
a
solomon
to
decide
it.
and
indeed,
in
the
second
hearing
that
he
had,
he
incorporated
all
the
evidence
that
was
taken
at
the
first
hearing
on
temporary
restraining
order
rather
on
preliminary
injunction.
and
that
is
something
that
could
not
have
been
done
with
a
jury
and,
if
one
imagines,
interposing
a
jury
into
this
complicated
delicate
process
which
has
been
confided
to
the
judge
and
which
he
actually
exercised.
it
--
the
--
it's
easy
to
imagine
just
how
terribly
confused
the
whole
thing
could
be.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
involves
conciliation
and
to
some
extent,
presiding
over
the
conciliation.
it
involves
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
--
the
judge
did
this.
if
that
is
a
separate
route.
it
also
may
occur
during
the
course
of
action,
and
it
did.
the
judge
said,
"can't
you
two
not
get
together?"
and
he
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
this
was
pretrial
and
post
trial
and
he
urged
them
to
try
to
settle
it
for
long.
i'm
not
trying
to
evaluate
orders
of
difficulty,
but
i'm
trying
to
describe
the
quality
of
what
goes
on
here
and
how
it's
peculiarly
appropriate
to
a
judge.
for
example,
in
attorney's
fees
and
costs
and
various
other
things
are
involved
with,
an
appointment
of
counsel
that
--
just
entirely
inappropriate
for
juries.
and,
he
balanced
all
these
things.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
that
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
some
things
he
does
alone,
that's
true.
but
congress
here
fashioned
what
i
would
term
"a
single
integrated
equitable
remedy"
that
had
all
these
various
components
to
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
am
not--
in
title
vii,
fair
employment
cases,
there
is
no
explicit
mention
of
punitive
damages
in
the
statute,
i
believe,
but
at
least
one
court
has
awarded
them
out
of
general
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
have
a
considerable
discussion
of
the
punitive
damage
forum
--
aspect
in
our
brief
and
it
is
quite
unclear
with
the
origin
of
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
which
punitive
damage
is--?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
certainly
in
contempt
matters
which
is
always
before
a
chancellor,
punitive
damages
may
be
imposed
both
in
civil
and
criminal
contempt
by
a
chancellor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
jack
greenberg
what
label
is
put
upon
them,
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case
and
what
the
statute
says
is
of
the
essence,
we
submit,
of
how
equity
acts.
congress
could
have
decided
these
cases
should
be
treated
in
equity
because
of
the
need
for
speed
and
expedition
because
of
the
possibility
of
jury
bias.
it
could've
done
it
because
this
particular
cause
of
action
was
unknown
to
the
common
law
in
what
was
done
involving
the
conveyance
of
real
property
or
the
signing
of
a
lease,
resembled
equity
more
than
it
resembled
law
and
did
bear
some
sort
of
analogy
to
equitable
servitudes
on
real
property.
congress
could
have
seen
that
the
equitable
and
legal
aspects
were
so
inextricably
entangled
that
it
had
to
be
one
or
another
and
therefore,
exercised
the
choice
to
deem
it
equitable,
not
legal.
and
against
all
of
these
considerations,
the
seventh
amendment,
we
submit,
can
be
applied
only
by
saying
this
is
a
cause
of
action
at
common
law.
and
that
can't
be
said
except
by
some
sort
of
an
analogy
and
we
submit
that
this
analogy
should
not
be
indulged
in
view
of
the
congressional
determination
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
the
policies
of
those
amendments
which
title
viii
seeks
to
advance.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'm
not
certain,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
do
know
that
in
actions
against
the
united
the
states
under
the
tucker
act
are
not
heard
by
a
jury
simply
because
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
am
not
aware
of
how
those
state
court
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
there
was
--
well
it
may
be,
but
there
was
no
congressional
deter
--
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
which
said
that
this
--
that
the
--
cause
of
action
of
this
sort
shall
be
tried
in
a
certain
way
and
it
had
equitable
components
and
bore
no
relationship
to
what
existed
at
the
common
law,
i
would
say
we
have
something
closer
to
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'd
--
i
really
do
not
know
whether
it's
quite
clear
and
we
certainly
don't
have
the
component
here
of
a
quite
complicated
multifaceted
congressional
remedy,
large
parts
of
which
are
unquestionably
equitable
in
a
congressional
determination
that
the
entire
thing
should
be
treated
in
equity
for
the
reasons
that
i
stated
because
it's
largely
equitable
or
resembles
equity,
it's
not
common
law,
but
if
it
could
de
deemed
such
only
by
analogy.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
what
is
involved
is
the
effectiveness
of
title
8
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1968
which
assures
fair
housing
to
all
americans
without
regard
to
race,
color,
national
origin,
or
religion.
the
effectiveness
of
the
act
is
threatened
in
this
case
by
a
claim
that
the
seventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
prohibits
congress
from
providing
that
civil
actions
under
the
act
be
tried
by
the
court
and
not
by
a
jury.
we
submit
that
the
court
trial
and
remedy
provisions
of
title
8
are
constitutional
as
within
the
power
of
congress
granted
by
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
seventh
amendment
preserving
jury
trials
in
suits
that
common
law
is
not
applicable
to
litigation
under
title
8.
briefly,
the
facts
of
the
case
or
that
petitioner
who
was
black,
while
a
patient
in
a
hospital
in
november
1969,
asked
a
white
friend
to
find
an
apartment
for
her.
the
friend
found
an
apartment
owned
by
respondents
and
it
appeared
that
a
lease
would
be,
or
perhaps
even
was,
consummated
with
respondents’
agent.
but
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
petitioner
was
black,
they
refused
to
go
through
with
the
deal.
the
district
court
found,
and
it
is
supported
in
the
record,
that
petitioner
was
denied
the
apartment
because
of
her
race.
the
court
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
on
november
17,
1969
ordering
respondents
not
to
rent
the
apartment
to
anyone
else
pending
resolution
of
the
dispute
and
then
did
a
preliminary
injunction
on
december
19
to
the
same
general
effect.
and
the
court
urged
both
parties
to
try
to
settle
the
dispute,
but
this
turned
out
to
be
impossible
and
efforts
to
conciliate
went
on
over
a
period
of
six
months.
and
more
than
six
months
after
the
action
had
commenced,
petitioner
could
no
longer
wait
for
the
case
to
be
concluded
and
took
another
apartment.
her
counsel
withdrew
the
application
for
an
order
directing
that
the
apartment
be
rented
to
her
though
went
on
with
other
aspects
of
the
case
and
asked
for
punitive
damages,
costs,
and
counsel
fees.
following
trial,
the
court
made
an
award
of
$250
in
punitive
damages
but
denied
counsel
fees
and
costs.
weighing
on
the
one
hand
the
importance
of
petitioner’s
rights
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
fact
that
the
respondent
had
been
denied
rent
for
the
apartment
during
the
period
the
case
was
before
the
court.
the
respondents
urged
in
the
district
court
that
the
case
should
have
been
heard
by
a
jury,
but
the
district
court
rejected
this
contention.
respondents
renewed
this
claim
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
we
submit
that
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
that
it
will
seriously
impair
the
effectiveness
of
title
viii.
that
it
involves
a
misreading
of
the
plain
unequivocal
language
of
title
viii
and
of
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
the
fair
housing
act
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
is
wrong
concerning
the
requirements
of
the
seventh
amendment.
at
this
point
of
the
litigation,
there
no
longer
seems
to
be
any
serious
dispute
between
the
parties
concerning
the
language
of
title
viii.
respondents
in
their
brief
offer
at
best
a
cursory
argument
that
the
statute
is
unclear
and
put
to
this
court
as
the
only
question
presented
whether
the
seventh
amendment
requires
jury
trials
in
title
viii
cases.
in
resolving
the
issues
before
the
court,
we
submit
that
we
should
first
look
at
the
statutory
language.
the
provisions
which
we
are
construing,
section
812
(c),
provides
that
“the
ourt”
shall
grant
relief
and
it
uses
the
word
“court”
in
that
subsection
as
well
as
elsewhere
in
the
statute
in
a
variety
of
ways
which
can
only
mean
“judge”
and
“judge
acting
without
a
jury.”
for
example,
the
statute
speaks
of
the
court
granting
permanent
or
temporary
injunctions
or
temporary
restraining
orders
and
of
awarding
costs.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
helps
me
a
great
deal
because
the
word
“court,”
we
submit,
is
used
consistently
throughout
the
statute.
and
if
the
word
“court”
is
used
in
connection
with
injunctions
and
counsel
fees
and
continuances
and
conciliation
and
in
several
other
contexts,
we
submit
that
within
a
single
section
the
word
“court,”
whenever
it
refers
to
damages,
means
the
same
as
the
word
“court”
in
all
those
other
connections.
we
submit
the
word
had
to
have
been
used
consistently.
indeed,
the
word
“court”
not
only
in
this
statute
but
throughout
the
entire
federal
code
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
consistently
invariably
means
court
and
judge
acting
without
a
jury.
when
the
congress
intends
to
use
the
term
“jury,”
it
knows
how
to
do
so
and
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
citation
of
a
large
number
of
statutes
in
which
congress
said
that
certain
issues
that
it
would
be
drive
by
a
jury
and
not
by
the
court.
and,
indeed,
in
this
record
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
is
the
next
question.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
first
point
in
our
argument
that
this
is
(inaudible),
that
this
is
mode
of
procedure
which
has
been
prescribed
by
congress.
and
that
the
prescription
by
congress
of
this
mode
of
procedure
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
is
entitled
to
great
weight
indeed,
as
even
controlling
in
this
case.
and
i
first
wanted
to
make
absolutely
unequivocally
clear
that
this
indeed,
is
what
congress
has
done.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
not
quite
certain
i
would
carry
that
--
my
argument
that
far
and
i
don't
have
to
carry
my
argument
that
far
because
our
next
point
is
that
this
is
not
a
common
law
action
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it'd
never
be
a
common
law
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
it
is
a
common
law
action,
i
think
we
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
case
and
we
would
have
to
then
look
at
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
not
certain
that
i
would,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
certainly
don't
have
to
in
this
case.
i
would
look
at
--
whether
the
--
i
would
look
at
the
equitable
quality
of
the
action
of
what
the
role
of
the
jury
would
be,
how
difficult
it
is
for
the
jury
to
decide
the
case,
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
might
argue
it,
but
i
certainly
do
not
have
to
and
i
am
not
going
to.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
in
fact,
i
think
probably
the
commerce
block
--
power
was
invoked
and
the
statute
does
in
part
rest
upon
it.
in
fact,
i'm
certain
the
statute
does
in
part,
rest
upon
the
commerce
power.
but
it
rests
upon
a
specific
constitutional
directives
to
implement
two
particulars
of
amendments
regarding
a
very
important
factor
in
american
life
to
which
the
congress
is
directing
itself.
the
commerce
power
is
more
diffused
by
but
i
would
say
the
commerce
power
would
be
adequate
and
it
has
involved
it.
just
going
beyond
my
effort
to
establish
that
they
made
court
and
court
acting
without
a
jury,
the
fair
housing
act
originally
was
a
part
of
a
1966
civil
rights
bill.
and
in
that
act
--
in
that
bill,
there
was
the
fair
housing
act
and
there
was
the
jury
selection
act
--
jury
selection
bill
which
later
became
the
jury
selection
act
of
1968.
in
that
single
piece
of
legislation,
congress
used
the
word
“court”
and
“jury”
in
juxtaposition
dealing
with
jury
selection,
and
then
used
the
word
“court”
in
dealing
with
fair
housing.
it'd
be
quite
strange
whether
in
a
single
piece
of
legislation,
which
later
they
--
then
was
enact
--
two
parts
of
which
were
enacted
two
weeks
apart
in
1968
with
terms
given
to
it
used
differently.
but
i
will
go
beyond
that
part
of
the
argument.
i
will
submit
that
the
congress
meant
court
and
it
meant
court
acting
without
a
jury.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
it
would
be
very
difficult.
one
would
then
have
to
look
at
some
of
the
other
attributes
of
the
action
and
see
whether
or
not,
for
example
as
mentioned
in
the
footnote
against
ross
versus
bernhard,
this
is
an
action
in
which
juries
might
have
particular
difficulty
in
coming
to
a
decision
or
whether
as
in
the
katchen
case
for
example,
whether
there
was
some
need
for
particular
expedition
in
the
action
and
so
forth.
but,
we
do
not
have
any
of
that
here.
in
fact,
this
case
--
in
--
the
only
cases
that
we're
aware
of,
in
fact,
in
which
congress
had
--
in
which
this
court
has
passed
upon
the
power
of
congress
to
require
enforcement
of
statutes
which
it
had
enacted
by
court
sitting
without
juries
are
nlrb
against
jones
and
laughlin
steel,
and
katchen
against
landy.
in
nlrb
against
jones
and
laughlin
steel,
this
court
held
that
backpay
and
other
monetary
awards
might
be
made
by
the
nlrb
and
enforced
by
the
court
of
appeals
without
intervention
by
a
jury
because
the
right
involved
did
not
exist
at
common
law.
in
katchen,
the
court
held
that
adjudication
of
the
validity
of
a
preference
in
summary
proceedings
under
the
bankruptcy
act
also
might
be
made
sitting
by
a
court
without
a
jury
and
the
decision
in
that
case,
as
i
understand
it,
rested
upon
the
fact
that
congress
determ
--
had
determined
the
need
for
speed
and
efficiency
in
the
essentially
equitable
nature
of
bankruptcy.
this
case
is
like
nlrb
against
jones
and
laughlin,
and
katchen
v.
landy
in
that
we
have
a
congressional
determination
that
the
case
shall
be
heard
by
the
court
and
not
by
a
jury.
it
is
further
like
the
nlrb
and
jones
and
laughlin
case
in
that
it
involves
a
new
congressionally
created
right.
and,
it's
like
katchen
in
that
there
is
a
special
need
for
speed
and
effectiveness
of
relief
which
would
be
impaired
by
jury
trial.
the
seventh
amendment
is
applicable
only
to
suits
at
common
law.
this
is
not
a
suit
at
common
law.
neither
in
1791
nor
for
a
century-and-a
half
thereafter
could
a
plaintiff
such
as
petitioner
have
brought
an
action
in
england
or
in
any
state
of
the
union
to
compel
a
landlord
not
to
discriminate
against
her
in
the
basis
of
race.
indeed,
throughout
most
of
this
period,
the
common
law
set
the
full
force
of
its
power
against
people
like
petitioners
and
behind
landlords
and
sellers
of
real
property
who
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
now,
against
this
congressional
decision
and
the
fact
that
the
cause
of
action
enforced
in
this
case
was
unknown
at
common
law
respondent
cites
the
three
cases,
and
the
court
of
appeals
does
to,
of
beacon
theatres,
dairy
queen,
and
ross
against
bernhard.
but
these
cases
first
did
not
involve
congressional
statutes.
they
involved
mixed,
legal,
and
equitable
claims
concerning
which
some
judicial
rule
was
necessary
as
to
whether
the
court
should
heard
be
--
whether
the
case
should
be
heard
by
a
judge
or
a
jury
without
regard
to
the
adventitiousness
of
who
first
commenced
the
action
or
what
it
was
characterized
as.
in
beacon,
if
the
defendant
had
filed
before
the
plaintiff,
the
jury
clearly
would
have
been
required.
in
dairy
cream
--
queen,
if
the
form
of
action
had
been
characterized
as
one
for
damages
rather
than
accounting,
a
jury
trial
would
have
not
been
disputed.
in
ross
against
bernhard,
if
the
corporation
itself
had
brought
the
action
instead
of
the
action
being
brought
on
the
form
of
stockholders
derivative
suit,
there
would've
been
no
question
that
a
jury
would
have
been
appropriate.
we
submit
that
while
there
is
seventh
amendment
language
in
these
decisions,
all
they
really
stand
for
is
that
the
substance
of
the
action
and
not
the
form
are
determinative
of
whether
the
case
should
be
heard
by
the
court
alone
or
with
the
jury.
the
statutory
right
claimed
by
petitioner
in
this
case
is
one
which
never
could
have
been
enforced
at
common
law
at
any
time,
in
any
place,
in
any
way.
moreover
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
may
be
that
there
is
some
analogy
or
there
is
a
statutory
counterpart
of
some
sort
of
a
common
law
right.
but
this
is
something
which
even
today,
apart
from
the
fact
of
race,
there
is
no
such
right
as
this.
if
a
would-be
buyer
goes
to
a
seller
and
the
seller
says,
“i
just
do
not
want
to
sell
to
you,”
there
is
nothing
anyone
can
do
about
it
unless
he
says
“i
do
not
want
to
sell
to
you
because
of
your
race.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
think
it's
a
whole
new
kind
of
right
which
indeed
was
enacted
after
a
very
considerable
congressional
struggle
in
which
the
debate
was
that
this
is
overturning
rights
of
sellers
and
owners
unknown
to
the
common
--
as
known
by
the
common
law.
but
in
any
event,
mr.
justice
white,
if
one
were
to
apply
the
seventh
amendment
to
this
case,
it
would
be
because
there
is
to
be
--
there
is
some
analogical
extension
of
some
sort
of
a
common
law
right
which
it
is
held
ought
to
be
protected
or
enforced
by
means
of
the
seventh
amendment.
on
the
other
hand,
as
compeer
to
that
analogical
extension,
we
have
the
direct
decision
of
congress
that
the
rights
secured
by
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
are
best
enforced
by
trials
conducted
in
this
kind
of
way
because
they're
more
expeditious.
it
removes
community
prejudice
from
the
proceedings
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
will
say
it
certainly
goes
so
far
as
to
overwrite
any
common
law
right
that
is
extended
by
--
that
is
created
by
analogic
extension
and
that's
all
i
have
to
say.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
the
nlrb
is
involved,
it
certainly
isn't.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it's
a
contract.
it's
a
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
contract
or
for
to
enforce
a
contract.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
it
is
a
common
law
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
commerce
clause
is
a
clause
which
gives
the
congress
power
to
enact
legislation
in
any
variety
of
directions.
under
the
commerce
clause
the
congress
can
enforce
or
refuse
to
enforce
or
deal
in
an
infinite
number
of
ways
with
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
express
very
positive
policies
concerning
racial
equality
which
congress
is
implementing
so
it's
a
rather
different
thing.
one
is
enforcing
the
policies
of
the
amendments.
the
other
is
merely
acting
under
authority
granted
by
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
it's
a
rather
different
situation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
--
well,
first
of
all,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
are
in
no
way
challenging
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
we
are
in
no
way
in
this
case
questioning
the
right
of
trial
by
jury.
in
criminal
cases,
we
are
no
way
in
this
case
questioning
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
in
what
might
--
one
one
might
call
fundamental
common
law
cases
or
their
modern
counterparts
or
reasonable
analogies
thereto.
with
regard
to
the
last
series
of
questions,
i
would
say
that,
to
the
extent
that
one
would
seek
to
find
some
analogy
in
the
common
law
to
what
is
done
in
the
fair
housing
act
and
thereby
advanced
the
constitutional
policies
of
the
seventh
amendment.
one
must
put
that
as
against
the
very
positive
policies
of
the
thirteenth
and
fouteenth
amendment
which
are
quite
different
i
would
submit,
mr.--
mr.
jack
greenberg
they're
entirely
more
than
--
they're
entirely
different
than
the
commerce
clause.
the
commerce
clause
is
a
power
to
enact
legislation
in
a
total
varie
--
under
the
commerce
clause,
presumably
back
to
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
one
might
be
able
to
enact
the
statute
saying
that
whites
do
not
have
to
sell
to
blacks.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh!
i
think,
without
a
doubt,
there
is.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
if
i
started
down
that
line
i
might
prove
a
little
too
much.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
in
summary,
all
we
say
is
that
where
congress
is
enforcing
the
cherished
values
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
by
proceedings
unknown
to
the
common
law
and
decides
that
the
cause
shall
be
determined
by
the
court
and
not
by
a
jury,
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
require
trial
by
jury.
and,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
that
in
title
8
congress
has
created
a
single
integrated
equitable
remedy,
out
of
which
a
court
might
fashion
relief
appropriate
to
particular
cases.
that
remedy
consists
of
various
parts.
statute
says
the
court
may
issue
temporary
restraining
orders,
preliminary
injunctions,
may
appoint
counsel,
may
foster
conciliation,
may
award
compensatory
damages,
may
award
punitive
damages,
may
award
costs,
and
may
award
counsel
fees
or
all
or
none
of
them.
now,
the
fact
that
money
damages
is
part
of
it,
the
entire
remedy
does
not
necessarily
make
it
legal
as
jones
&
laughlin
demonstrates.
a
judge
is
suppose
to
pick
and
choose
among
these
various
aspects
of
the
remedy
and
harmonize
them
in
a
manner
appropriate
to
the
case.
and
it's
instructive
to
look
at
just
what
the
judge
did
in
this
particular
case.
he
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order.
he
granted
a
preliminary
injunction.
he
urged
settlement
discussions
which
went
on
for
many
months.
so
long,
in
fact,
that
mrs.
rogers
had
to
take
a
new
apartment.
he
denied
compensatory
damages.
he
granted
punitive
damages
and
in
doing
that,
he
took
into
account
the
fact
that
the
respondent
had
been
denied
rent
for
the
apartment
for
a
period
of
6
months.
he
denied
attorney
fees
and
he
denied
costs.
he
engaged
in
the
typical
kind
of
balancing
that
a
chancellor
engages
in
and,
indeed,
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
had
had
a
very
difficult
case
before
him
and
it
would
take
as
--
he
said,
the
wisdom
of
a
solomon
to
decide
it.
and
indeed,
in
the
second
hearing
that
he
had,
he
incorporated
all
the
evidence
that
was
taken
at
the
first
hearing
on
temporary
restraining
order
rather
on
preliminary
injunction.
and
that
is
something
that
could
not
have
been
done
with
a
jury
and,
if
one
imagines,
interposing
a
jury
into
this
complicated
delicate
process
which
has
been
confided
to
the
judge
and
which
he
actually
exercised.
it
--
the
--
it's
easy
to
imagine
just
how
terribly
confused
the
whole
thing
could
be.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
involves
conciliation
and
to
some
extent,
presiding
over
the
conciliation.
it
involves
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
--
the
judge
did
this.
if
that
is
a
separate
route.
it
also
may
occur
during
the
course
of
action,
and
it
did.
the
judge
said,
"can't
you
two
not
get
together?"
and
he
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
this
was
pretrial
and
post
trial
and
he
urged
them
to
try
to
settle
it
for
long.
i'm
not
trying
to
evaluate
orders
of
difficulty,
but
i'm
trying
to
describe
the
quality
of
what
goes
on
here
and
how
it's
peculiarly
appropriate
to
a
judge.
for
example,
in
attorney's
fees
and
costs
and
various
other
things
are
involved
with,
an
appointment
of
counsel
that
--
just
entirely
inappropriate
for
juries.
and,
he
balanced
all
these
things.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
that
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
some
things
he
does
alone,
that's
true.
but
congress
here
fashioned
what
i
would
term
"a
single
integrated
equitable
remedy"
that
had
all
these
various
components
to
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
am
not--
in
title
vii,
fair
employment
cases,
there
is
no
explicit
mention
of
punitive
damages
in
the
statute,
i
believe,
but
at
least
one
court
has
awarded
them
out
of
general
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
have
a
considerable
discussion
of
the
punitive
damage
forum
--
aspect
in
our
brief
and
it
is
quite
unclear
with
the
origin
of
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
which
punitive
damage
is--?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
certainly
in
contempt
matters
which
is
always
before
a
chancellor,
punitive
damages
may
be
imposed
both
in
civil
and
criminal
contempt
by
a
chancellor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
jack
greenberg
what
label
is
put
upon
them,
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
what
the
judge
did
in
this
case
and
what
the
statute
says
is
of
the
essence,
we
submit,
of
how
equity
acts.
congress
could
have
decided
these
cases
should
be
treated
in
equity
because
of
the
need
for
speed
and
expedition
because
of
the
possibility
of
jury
bias.
it
could've
done
it
because
this
particular
cause
of
action
was
unknown
to
the
common
law
in
what
was
done
involving
the
conveyance
of
real
property
or
the
signing
of
a
lease,
resembled
equity
more
than
it
resembled
law
and
did
bear
some
sort
of
analogy
to
equitable
servitudes
on
real
property.
congress
could
have
seen
that
the
equitable
and
legal
aspects
were
so
inextricably
entangled
that
it
had
to
be
one
or
another
and
therefore,
exercised
the
choice
to
deem
it
equitable,
not
legal.
and
against
all
of
these
considerations,
the
seventh
amendment,
we
submit,
can
be
applied
only
by
saying
this
is
a
cause
of
action
at
common
law.
and
that
can't
be
said
except
by
some
sort
of
an
analogy
and
we
submit
that
this
analogy
should
not
be
indulged
in
view
of
the
congressional
determination
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
the
policies
of
those
amendments
which
title
viii
seeks
to
advance.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'm
not
certain,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
do
know
that
in
actions
against
the
united
the
states
under
the
tucker
act
are
not
heard
by
a
jury
simply
because
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
am
not
aware
of
how
those
state
court
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
there
was
--
well
it
may
be,
but
there
was
no
congressional
deter
--
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
which
said
that
this
--
that
the
--
cause
of
action
of
this
sort
shall
be
tried
in
a
certain
way
and
it
had
equitable
components
and
bore
no
relationship
to
what
existed
at
the
common
law,
i
would
say
we
have
something
closer
to
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'd
--
i
really
do
not
know
whether
it's
quite
clear
and
we
certainly
don't
have
the
component
here
of
a
quite
complicated
multifaceted
congressional
remedy,
large
parts
of
which
are
unquestionably
equitable
in
a
congressional
determination
that
the
entire
thing
should
be
treated
in
equity
for
the
reasons
that
i
stated
because
it's
largely
equitable
