--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenberg,
supposing
that
congress
had
acted
--
enacted
the
statute,
the
housing
act,
pursuant
to
its
authority
under
the
commerce
power
rather
than
its
authority
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
would
that
at
all
weaken
or
strengthen
your
jury
trial
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
both
are
grants
of
power
to
the
congress.
would
you
say
that
congress
in
enforcing
authority
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment,
could
say
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
shall
have
no
application
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
why
is
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
more
important
than
the
seventh
amendment
trial
by
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
justice
brennan
and
i
should
just
argue
back
and
forth
and
--
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
are
they
more
positive
than
the
commerce
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
--
that's
broader
admittedly
but
you
give
an
impression
that
there's
some
sort
of
depth
or
thrust
to
the
thirteenth
and
fouteenth
amendment
authorities,
that
there
isn't
to
the
commerce
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
scott,
on
the
issue
of
discrimination
of
course,
if
the
plaintiffs
had
sought
only
an
injunction,
that
same
issue
would've
been
tried
and
if
you
concede
then
it
would've
been
tried
to
the
court,
don't
you?
