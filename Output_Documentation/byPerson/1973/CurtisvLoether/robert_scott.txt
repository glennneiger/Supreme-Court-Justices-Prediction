mr.
robert
scott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
my
honor
to
represent
in
this
action
the
respondents
who
seek
to
have
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
and
this
case
returned
to
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
for
trial
by
jury.
when
i
argued
this
appeal
before
the
seventh
circuit
in
chicago
in
february
1972
most
of
the
questions
that
came
to
me
from
the
bench,
at
least
at
the
start
of
the
oral
arguments,
related
to
what
the
actual
posture
of
this
case
was
before
the
trial
court.
now
i
think
my
brother
in
giving
you
the
general
outline
of
what
the
facts
of
this
case
are,
overlooked
a
very
important
factual
aspect
of
the
case
which
was
at
issue
in
those
oral
arguments
and
which
the
seventh
circuit
drew
concession
from
the
appellee
at
that
level.
first
of
all,
this
was
a
case,
justice
white,
for
damages
on
the
basis
of
a
civil
wrong.
it
was
a
tort
action.
there
are
analogs
in
the
common
law
which
the
seventh
circuit
discovered.
the
important
thing
which
the
seventh
circuit
seek
to
--
sought
to
find
out
about
this
case
when
it
was
in
tried
is
what
issues
were
before
the
trial
court
when
the
availability
or
non-availability
of
a
jury
became
critical.
and
those
issues
before
the
trial
court
on
the
day
of
trial,
october
26,
1970,
were
simply
the
issues
of
discrimination
and
the
issue
of
money
damages,
compensatory
damages,
and
punitive
damages.
and
this
is
most
clearly
brought
out,
i
think,
on
page
47
(a)
of
the
appendix
where
the
trial
court,
when
it
was
summing
up
after
all
the
trial,
summed
up
the
evidence
and
said,
“therefore,
the
only
issue
remaining
for
this
hearing
today,
the
final
hearing
on
the
question
of
discrimination
and
the
claim
for
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.”
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
the
issue
of
damages
or
what
was
before
the
court
and
i
listen
very
carefully
when
my
brother
and
opened
to
see
if
there
would
be
any
discussion
of
the
fact
that
this
was
after
all
just
an
action
for
damages
albeit
a
statutory
cause
of
action.
and
i
think
there
is
ample
authority
in
the
brief
which
i
have
cited.
to
the
effect
that
there
is
no
cleavage
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
seventh
amendment
between
cases
which
are
brought
on
statutory
actions
and
cases
which
are
common
law
in
their
origin.
there
are
two
main
areas
of
legal
dispute
in
this
case.
one
is
a
statutory
argument
which
my
brother
first
got
into
in
which
depends
on
how
you
read
the
statute.
mr.
robert
scott
it
means
that
in
all
actions
in
which
under
a
three-test
which
this
court
approved
of
in
a
recent
case,
ross
versus
bernhard,
footnote
10
to
that
case,
there
are
three
ways
you
decide
what
the
seventh
amendment
means
in
any
given
circumstances
on
which
the
case
is
brought.
first
of
all,
you
look
at
the
premerger
custom
with
respect
to
the
issue.
second
of
all,
you
look
at
the
remedy
requested.
and
thirdly,
you
determine
what
the
practical
abilities
and
limitations
of
jurors
are
with
respect
to
the
issues
that
are
going
to
be
tried.
now,
ross
versus
bernhard
was
decided
while
our
case
was
pending
before
the
district
court
before
it
ever
got
up
to
the
seventh
circuit.
and
i
cited
ross
versus
bernhard
at
the
time
of
oral
arguments
on
the
jury
issue
before
the
district
court.
when
the
seventh
circuit
decided
this
case,
it
tracked,
if
you
will,
the
three
standards
in
ross
versus
bernhard
and
i
would
like
to
track
them
again
with
you
so
that
we
can
see
how
the
seventh
amendment
does
apply
to
this
particular
cause
of
action.
bearing
in
mind
how
that
action
was
postured
when
it
reached
the
time
in
the
course
of
its
litigation
when
the
availability
of
a
jury
became
important.
and
are
--
i
mentioned
that
i
just
parenthetically
because
this
case
started
out
of
course
with
claims
for
injunctive
relief
and
it
is
part
of
the
argument
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
the
granting
of
seventh
amendment
rights
to
this
case,
in
this
type
of
case,
would
emasculate
the
statute
because
then
you
couldn't
have
the
speedy
relief
that's
necessary
to
handle
discrimination
in
housing.
this
case
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
speedy
relief
is
available
consistent
with
the
seventh
amendment
and
the
reason
is,
all
of
the
speedy
type
of
relief,
the
injunctive
relief,
had
been
granted
in
this
case
well
before
the
availability
of
a
jury
became
important.
it
was
decided,
as
just,
as
chief
justice
burger
suggested,
by
the
court.
injunctions
were
granted.
but
to
move
to
the
test
in
ross
versus
berhnahrd
and
how
they
apply
to
our
circumstances,
the
first
two
tests
are
the
premerger
custom
in
the
nature
of
the
relief
granted.
to
my
way
of
thinking,
these
two
tests
really
embodied
the
traditional
historical
analytic
approach
that
this
court
has
adapted
in
its
cases
--
in
all
of
its
cases
determining
the
applicability
of
the
seventh
amendment.
there
are
two
ways
of
applying
the
first
test,
namely,
the
premerger
custom.
one
is
the
literal
approach
which
my
brother
--
and
suggests.
in
other
words,
you'll
look
at
the
common
laws
that
existed
in
1791
in
england
and
if
this
type
of
cause
of
action
did
not
exist
by
that
name
at
that
time,
then
you
have
no
seventh
amendment
right.
there
is
another
approach
and
that
is
the
approach
suggested
by
justice
story
in
parsons
versus
bedford,
and
that
case
which
was
cited
with
approval
in
ross
versus
bernhard.
justice
story
said
that
the
seventh
amendment,
the
preservative
power
of
the
seventh
amendment
reaches
all
lawsuits
except
those
which
are
of
equity
or
admiralty
jurisdiction.
in
other
words,
you
look
at
the
dichotomy
which
existed
in
england
between
the
law
and
equity
and
you
decide
not
necessarily
whether
this
particular
statutory
cause
of
action
existed
by
this
name
at
that
time,
but
really
what
jurisdiction
would
a
cause
of
action
such
as
this--
mr.
robert
scott
that's
right.
justice
field,
as
i
recall,
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
robert
scott
story,
that's
right,
but
i
think
you
are
right
about
the
dissent.
in
other
words,
if
you
apply
story’s
analysis,
you
go
beyond
the
literal
approach
to
determine
what
the
nature
of
this
cause
of
action
is.
and
again,
when
it
was
tried
it
was
an
action
for
damages,
compensatory
and
punitive
on
the
basis
of
a
civil
wrong.
our
argument
and
the
argument
adapted
by
the
seventh
circuit
was
that
that
particular
type
of
cause
of
action
would
certainly
have
belonged
in
the
law
side
in
england
in
1791.
go
on
to
the
next
test
which
is
probably
the
easiest
of
the
three.
the
relief
grant
--
requested
in
this
particular
case.
the
relief,
the
only
relief
which
was
tried
was
money
damages,
compensatory
and
punitive.
mr.
robert
scott
that's
right.
i'll
clarify
that
because
i
wanted
to
do
that
the
very
start
and
that
is
one
of
the
questions
that
the
seventh
circuit
went
at
us
with.
when
this
complaint
was
filed,
it
did
not
have
a
request
for
compensatory
damages
that
are
--
at
the
first
pretrial
conference,
they
interjected
that
they
would
like
to
include
a
claim
for
actual
damages.
by
that
time,
as
my
recollection
serves
me,
district
judge
reynolds
had
already
granted
his
injunctive
relief.
so
after
the
--
at
the
first
pretrial
conference,
this
came
up
and
when
i
was
explaining
this
to
the
seventh
circuit,
district
judge
candle
said,
“well,
it
can
be
brought
up
under
rule
16
in
that
fashion,
can
it?”
and
i
said
“well,
that
is
exactly
how
it
did
occur.”
and,
in
the
next
pretrial
order
that
issued
out
from
that
conference
the
district
judge
directed
that
the
trial
would
be
on
the
issue
of
actual
damages
and
discrimination,
and
this
was
formalized
--
mr.
robert
scott
there
was
never
a
formal
amendment
to
the
complaint.
mr.
robert
scott
thank
you.
mr.
robert
scott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon
in
the
course
of
his
discussion
of
this
case,
my
distinguished
opposing
counsel,
in
response
to
a
question
by
the
chief
justice
conceited
that
if
this
case
is
in
fact
in
a
nature
of
a
common
law
action
then
it
cannot
escape
the
reach
of
the
preservative
power
of
the
seventh
amendment.
when
court
adjourned
yesterday
afternoon,
in
response
to
another
question
by
the
chief
justice,
i
was
responding
to
how
the
seventh
amendment
test
may
be
applied
to
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case
and
i
would
like
to
pursue
that
further
this
morning.
when
we
adjourned
yesterday,
i
had
concluded
my
discussion
with
regard
to
the
first
test
announced
by
this
court
in
ross
versus
bernhard,
namely,
how
the
circumstances
of
this
case
compared
--
contrast
with
the
premerger
custom
of
the
federal
courts
with
respect
to
like
issues.
and,
i
suggested
to
the
court
the
test
proposed
by
justice
story
in
parsons
versus
bedford
to
the
effect
that
the
seventh
amendment
reaches
all
cases
which
are
not
of
equity
or
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
i
also
suggested
that
the
literal
approach
be
rejected.
and
i
would
pass
on
now
to
the
other
two
tests
which
were
announced
in
ross
versus
bernhard,
namely,
what
type
of
relief
is
requested
and,
thirdly,
third
test
being
the
practical
abilities
and
limitations
of
juries.
the
second
test,
i
think,
is
particularly
applicable
to
this
case
and
this
goes
back
to
a
question
that
justice
brennan
asked
me
yesterday
afternoon
with
respect
to
what
type
of
relief
was
asked
for.
i
recall
the
justice
asking
whether
or
not
actual
damages
had
been
asked
for
in
the
complaint
and
the
record
shows,
i
believe,
that
they
were
not.
however,
they
did
enter
the
case
by
way
of
a
pretrial
order
after
the
first
pretrial
conference
and,
in
all
subsequent
pretrial
orders
issued
by
the
district
court,
this
case
was
announced
to
be
one
on
damages.
and
when
it
came
time
for
this
case
to
be
decided
after
the
trial
had
been
concluded,
and
i
am
referring
specifically
to
page
51
(a)
of
the
appendix,
at
the
top
of
that
page,
the
district
court
said,
"now,
we
come
to
the
question,
the
questions
of
damages."
further
down
in
that
page
the
district
court
said,
"i
do
not
believe
there
had
been
any
compensatory
damages
proven
in
this
case
or
out
of
pocket
expenses
of
that
nature."
and
so
he
rejected
the
claim
for
compensatory
damages.
there
had
been
a
trial
on
compensatory
damages.
all
the
evidence
elicited
by
the
plaintiff
on
direct
testimony
had
related
to
actual
damages.
the
plaintiff
offered
no
testimony
with
respect
to
the
other
issue
that
was
being
tried,
namely
the
issue
of
discrimination,
because
the
court
had
incorporated
the
testimony
that
had
been
elicited
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
injunction
on
that
issue.
practically,
the
entire
testimony
in
that
two
days
of
trial
related
to
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
if
at
all,
the
plaintiff
had
sustained
any
actual
damages.
and
in
the
final
analysis,
very
specifically,
the
trial
court
rejected
that
claim
and
went
on
to
award
punitive
damages
in
the
amount
of
$250.
and
this
was
a
--
this
topic
was
a
source
of
some
discussion
when
this
case
was
argued
before
the
seventh
circuit
and
at
that
time,
opposing
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
conceited
to
the
seventh
circuit
that
actual
damages
were
in
the
case.
now,
why
is
this
important
with
respect
to
the
second
issue
in
ross
versus
bernhard?
you
look
to
see
what
type
of
relief
is
requested,
particularly
at
the
time
when
the
availability
of
a
jury
becomes
important
to
determine
the
reach
of
the
seventh
amendment
at
least
in
part.
and
there
are
two
reasons
at
least
why
the
type
of
relief
requested
is
important
to
the
jury
issue
cause
it
goes
to
the
abilities
of
juries.
and
i'd
point
this
out
that
we
had
two
claims
for
money
damages;
actual
damages,
punitive
damages.
both
of
those
are
issues
that
juries
are
particularly
responsive
to
particularly
in
determining
the
extent
of
damages.
this
is
one
area
where
appellate
courts,
i
find
are
laws
overturn,
the
finding
of
juries
because
that
is
one
of
their
particular
strengths
and
i
think
there
is
probably
no
damage
issue
at
law
that
calls
upon
the
common
sense
judgment
of
jurors
more
than
the
question
of
whether,
and
to
what
extent,
punitive
damages
should
be
awarded.
both
of
these
damage
issues
were
before
us
at
the
time
the
jury
trial
issue
became
critical.
mr.
robert
scott
exactly.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
referred
specifically
to
those
types
of
action
in
my
brief
and
to
the
fact
that
previously
this
court
has
held,
and
i
think,
specifically
in
ross
versus
bernhard,
those
types
of
issues
were
mentioned
as
ones
to
which
the
seventh
amendment
reaches,
in
which
the
jury
right
is
preserved.
we
pass
on,
if
i
may,
to
the
third
test
in
ross
versus
bernhard.
this
is
the
test
which
was
described
as
being
the
practical
abilities
and
limitations
of
juries.
i
feel,
in
some
regard,
this
is
the
real
battleground
to
this
case.
that
test
is
--
as
i
read
ross,
was
not
applied
in
ross.
in
my
brief,
i
suggested
that
the
test
includes
at
least
two
considerations.
one
is
the
consideration
of
whether
or
not
juries,
given
the
particular
issues
that
are
going
to
be
tried,
can
deal
competently
and
justly
with
those
particular
issues.
brings
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
issues
are
very
complicated
or,
for
other
policy
reasons,
might
best
be
withdrawn
from
juries.
and
i
would
suggest
there
is
another
consideration
included
in
that
third
criteria
set
down
in
ross,
namely,
whether
or
not
this
particular
cause
of
action
with
a
jury
trial
right
attached
to
it
will
frustrate
any
particular
statutory
purpose
or
frustrate
any
particular
statutory
scheme.
and
i
am
thinking
particularly
in
this
regard
of
katchen,
and
i
will
get
to
that
point
after
discussing
the
first
consideration,
if
i
may,
because
i
want
to
suggest
that
in
terms
of
the
competence
of
juries
this
case
is
an
excellent
example
of
just
the
type
of
issue
that
should
go
to
jury
consideration
because
what's
going
to
be
tried
here
are
questions
of
credibility
and
motivation.
this
trial,
on
the
discrimination
issue
particularly,
involved
whether
or
not
at
the
time
leroy
loether
determined
not
to
rent
one
of
the
two
flats
in
the
two-flat
home
that
he
happened
to
own
to
the
plaintiff,
whether
or
not
at
that
time
his
motivation
was
based
on
race
or
based
solely
on
other
considerations.
leroy
loether
testified
at
this
trial.
his
wife
testified.
to
the
--
two
of
them
owned
the
house
together.
and
what
was
called
upon
for
a
determination
of
the
discrimination
issue
was
a
testing
of
their
credibility,
and
this
is
an
area
where
there
is
particular
strength
of
jurors.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
he
had
a
racial
motivation.
he
said
he
didn't.
he
said
it
was
because
of
something
else.
he
said
if
the
same
circumstances
had
been
presented
and
district
judge
reynolds
had
been
the
applicant
for
the
apartment,
he
would
have
refused
him
in
those
circumstances.
this
was
his
testimony
on
cross-examination
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
robert
scott
right.
that's
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
further
response
to
that,
i
believe
we've
made
that
concession
down
the
line
in
the
previous
hearings
on
this
issue.
injunctive
relief
was
asked
for
at
the
outset
and
just
--
to
put
this
a
little
bit
in
perspective,
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
asked
for.
it
was
granted
before
the
first
hearing.
a
preliminary
injunction
was
requested
to
follow
up
the
tro.
we
had
a
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
and
that
injunction
was
granted
by
order
of
the
district
court
on
december
19,
1969
very
briefly
after
the
action
had
been
started
in
november.
the
following
month,
in
january
of
1970,
we
were
advised
in
a
pretrial
conference
that
the
plaintiff
no
longer
wish
to
occupy
the
apartment
and
at
that
time,
a
proposal
was
made
with
the
court's
concurrence
that
the
matter
be
resolved
by
renting
to
any
black
family
or
any
black
individual.
and,
at
the
time
we
returned
to
argue
the
jury
trial
issue
to
the
district
court
in
april
1970,
the
plaintiff's
counsel
reported
back
that
that
particular
offer
had
been
rejected
by
the
plaintiff
and
at
that
time,
the
injunctive
relief
was
abandoned.
and
so
when
this
case
went
to
trial,
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
injunctive
relief
that
was
requested.
all
that
was
asked
for
by
way
of
relief
was
in
terms
of
money
damages,
both
punitive
and
compensatory.
mr.
robert
scott
preliminary
injunction
was
dissolved
with
the
consent
of
the
plaintiff,
your
honor.
it
was
dissolved
in
april
of
1970
after
the
plaintiff
rejected
our
proposal
for
resolving
the
case.
mr.
robert
scott
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
scott
i'm
fairly
sure
it
is
in
the
appendix.
i
know
--
mr.
robert
scott
that
it's
in
the
record
because
i
argued
the
matter
on
the
jury
trial
issue
to
the
district
court
on
that
april
day
in
1970
when
it
was
decided,
and
i
believe
i
have
a
record
cite
or
appendix
cite
in
my
brief.
mr.
robert
scott
all
right.
i
don't
want
to
go
beyond
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
scott
we
had
a
fairly
elaborate
hearing
on
that,
your
honor,
and
certainly,
the
court
was
called
upon
to
make
a
determination
but
it
was
not
a
binding
determination
on
the
merits.
and,
this
is
why
i
would
argue
that
the
availability
of
a
jury
in
this
case
does
not
frustrate
the
need
for
speed
of
relief.
mr.
robert
scott
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
scott
yes,
your
honor.
if
a
permanent
injunction
had
been
requested
in
this
case
together
with
the
other
elements
of
relief,
then
i
would
be
still
before
you
this
morning
arguing
that
the
seventh
amendment
reaches
that.
mr.
robert
scott
no,
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
two
full
trials.
you'd
have
to
have
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
discrimination,
on
the
issue
of
damages
and
the
issues
of
fact
would
be
directed
to
the
jury.
mr.
robert
scott
they'd
be
different
in
what
regard?
the
issues
of
fact
would
be
the
same.
mr.
robert
scott
would
what
be
different?
i'm
afraid
i
do
not
follow
you.
mr.
robert
scott
no.
mr.
robert
scott
it's
exactly
the
same.
mr.
robert
scott
we're
not
proposing
two
trials.
well,
i
thought
you
said
if
he
got
a
permanent
injunction
he
still
would
have
to
have
a
trial
on
damages.
mr.
robert
scott
we
had
a
request
for
permanent
injunction,
all
factual
issues.
i
believe
this
is
the
teaching
of
the
case,
it's
under
the
seventh
amendment.
all
factual
issues
would
be
addressed
to
the
jury.
they
would
have
to
determine
in
the
first
instance,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
there
is
any
discrimination.
mr.
robert
scott
no,
it
is
not.
but
it
is
--
mr.
robert
scott
that
are
common.
mr.
robert
scott
that's
my
position.
mr.
robert
scott
i'm
aware
of
your
dissent
in
the
laws.
mr.
robert
scott
no,
i
say
that
this
court
has
said
it
and
has
said
it
repeatedly.
mr.
robert
scott
no,
i
don't
believe
section
812
is
unconstitutional.
in
the
seventh
amendment
--
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
robert
scott
and
i
would
argue
that
that
use
of
the
term
"the
court"
is
an
institutional
reference
and
i
would
--
mr.
robert
scott
if
812
can
be
properly
read
to
exclude
the
right
to
a
jury
on
the
factual
issues
pertaining
to
a
case
that
involves
common
law
issues,
then
812
is
unconstitutional.
that
issue
was
avoided
by
the
seventh
circuit,
by
another
reading
of
that
section.
and
to
a
certain
extent,
their
position
was
supported
by
the
only
legislative
history
that
has
been
brought
into
this
record
and
that
is
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general
katzenbach
at
the
time
this
case
or
this
issue
--
that
the
statute
was
an
issue
before
the
congress.
and,
i
refer
specifically
to
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
15
and
16
where
senator
irvin
asked
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
objection
to
having
the
statute
amended
to
spell
out
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
have
the
issues
of
fact
tried
to
a
jury
when
there's
a
damage
issue.
and,
the
attorney
general
said,
"no."
on
the
damage
suit,
i
have
no
objection
to
that.
that's
the
only
legislative
history
we've
got
in
the
record
on
this
case
and
i
think
it
supports
an
appropriate
reading
of
812
and
that
is
that
it's
silent
on
the
jury
trial
issue
and
you
can
avoid
ruling
that
that
statute
is
unconstitutional.
as
i've
said,
i
believe
that
this
case
is
particularly
appropriate
for
jury
determination
because
of
the
issues
of
credibility.
i
had
also
urged
that
this
statute
with
the
jury
trial
right
attached
to
it
under
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
frustrate
any
statutory
scheme
in
any
of
the
regard
suggested
in
the
cases
of
katchen
versus
landy
or
jones
&
laughlin
versus
nlrb
or
nlrb
versus
jones
&
laughlin.
and
i
distinguish
in
my
brief
the
katchen
case
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
in
that
case,
namely,
what
the
court
was
dealing
with,
there
was
a
very
specific
summary
type
of
proceeding.
.
and,
in
katchen,
justice
white
distinguished
between
the
summary
proceeding
of
bankruptcy
and
the
plenary
proceeding.
mr.
robert
scott
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
distinction
was
made
in
that
case
by
the
court.
and
i
believe
the
distinction
is
important
to
our
case
because
what
we
have
here
is
a
civil
action
established
by
congress
as
such
with
all
of
the
(inaudible),
an
ordinary
lawsuit
accompanying
it
at
the
time
of
trial,
pretrial
conferences,
pretrial
orders,
or
regular
trial,
not
a
summary
proceeding,
an
informal
proceeding
such
as
that
provided
for
in
the
bankruptcy
statute
for
summary
proceeding.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
said
that
katchen
was
dispositive
of
our
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
katchen
and
nlrb
versus
jones
&
laughlin
are
quite
distinguishable.
they
involve
what
was
referred
to
in
nlrb
versus
jones
&
laughlin
as
a
statutory
proceeding.
we
have
a
civil
action
very
much
like
an
ordinary
lawsuit.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
here
provides
for
an
alternate
proceeding
that
is
really
quite
a
bit
more
like
the
summary
proceeding
than
our
civil
action
we
have
here.
and
that's
the
proceeding
by
which
an
aggrieved
party
can
apply
to
the
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
for
conciliation
and
it
provides
the
secretary
with
a
vast
panoply
of
discovery
procedures,
subpoena,
power
to
get
at
the
heart
of
whatever
the
dispute
is.
that
path
was
not
chosen
in
this
case.
instead,
the
petitioner
started
a
civil
action.
for
that
reason,
upon
their
choice
of
trying
their
case
in
district
court
as
a
civil
action
with
questions
of
damages
attached,
we
would
strongly
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
unanimous
opinion
below
and
to
return
this
case
for
a
trial
by
jury
in
accordance
to
the
decision
below.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
robert
scott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
my
honor
to
represent
in
this
action
the
respondents
who
seek
to
have
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
and
this
case
returned
to
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
for
trial
by
jury.
when
i
argued
this
appeal
before
the
seventh
circuit
in
chicago
in
february
1972
most
of
the
questions
that
came
to
me
from
the
bench,
at
least
at
the
start
of
the
oral
arguments,
related
to
what
the
actual
posture
of
this
case
was
before
the
trial
court.
now
i
think
my
brother
in
giving
you
the
general
outline
of
what
the
facts
of
this
case
are,
overlooked
a
very
important
factual
aspect
of
the
case
which
was
at
issue
in
those
oral
arguments
and
which
the
seventh
circuit
drew
concession
from
the
appellee
at
that
level.
first
of
all,
this
was
a
case,
justice
white,
for
damages
on
the
basis
of
a
civil
wrong.
it
was
a
tort
action.
there
are
analogs
in
the
common
law
which
the
seventh
circuit
discovered.
the
important
thing
which
the
seventh
circuit
seek
to
--
sought
to
find
out
about
this
case
when
it
was
in
tried
is
what
issues
were
before
the
trial
court
when
the
availability
or
non-availability
of
a
jury
became
critical.
and
those
issues
before
the
trial
court
on
the
day
of
trial,
october
26,
1970,
were
simply
the
issues
of
discrimination
and
the
issue
of
money
damages,
compensatory
damages,
and
punitive
damages.
and
this
is
most
clearly
brought
out,
i
think,
on
page
47
(a)
of
the
appendix
where
the
trial
court,
when
it
was
summing
up
after
all
the
trial,
summed
up
the
evidence
and
said,
“therefore,
the
only
issue
remaining
for
this
hearing
today,
the
final
hearing
on
the
question
of
discrimination
and
the
claim
for
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.”
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
the
issue
of
damages
or
what
was
before
the
court
and
i
listen
very
carefully
when
my
brother
and
opened
to
see
if
there
would
be
any
discussion
of
the
fact
that
this
was
after
all
just
an
action
for
damages
albeit
a
statutory
cause
of
action.
and
i
think
there
is
ample
authority
in
the
brief
which
i
have
cited.
to
the
effect
that
there
is
no
cleavage
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
seventh
amendment
between
cases
which
are
brought
on
statutory
actions
and
cases
which
are
common
law
in
their
origin.
there
are
two
main
areas
of
legal
dispute
in
this
case.
one
is
a
statutory
argument
which
my
brother
first
got
into
in
which
depends
on
how
you
read
the
statute.
mr.
robert
scott
it
means
that
in
all
actions
in
which
under
a
three-test
which
this
court
approved
of
in
a
recent
case,
ross
versus
bernhard,
footnote
10
to
that
case,
there
are
three
ways
you
decide
what
the
seventh
amendment
means
in
any
given
circumstances
on
which
the
case
is
brought.
first
of
all,
you
look
at
the
premerger
custom
with
respect
to
the
issue.
second
of
all,
you
look
at
the
remedy
requested.
and
thirdly,
you
determine
what
the
practical
abilities
and
limitations
of
jurors
are
with
respect
to
the
issues
that
are
going
to
be
tried.
now,
ross
versus
bernhard
was
decided
while
our
case
was
pending
before
the
district
court
before
it
ever
got
up
to
the
seventh
circuit.
and
i
cited
ross
versus
bernhard
at
the
time
of
oral
arguments
on
the
jury
issue
before
the
district
court.
when
the
seventh
circuit
decided
this
case,
it
tracked,
if
you
will,
the
three
standards
in
ross
versus
bernhard
and
i
would
like
to
track
them
again
with
you
so
that
we
can
see
how
the
seventh
amendment
does
apply
to
this
particular
cause
of
action.
bearing
in
mind
how
that
action
was
postured
when
it
reached
the
time
in
the
course
of
its
litigation
when
the
availability
of
a
jury
became
important.
and
are
--
i
mentioned
that
i
just
parenthetically
because
this
case
started
out
of
course
with
claims
for
injunctive
relief
and
it
is
part
of
the
argument
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
the
granting
of
seventh
amendment
rights
to
this
case,
in
this
type
of
case,
would
emasculate
the
statute
because
then
you
couldn't
have
the
speedy
relief
that's
necessary
to
handle
discrimination
in
housing.
this
case
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
speedy
relief
is
available
consistent
with
the
seventh
amendment
and
the
reason
is,
all
of
the
speedy
type
of
relief,
the
injunctive
relief,
had
been
granted
in
this
case
well
before
the
availability
of
a
jury
became
important.
it
was
decided,
as
just,
as
chief
justice
burger
suggested,
by
the
court.
injunctions
were
granted.
but
to
move
to
the
test
in
ross
versus
berhnahrd
and
how
they
apply
to
our
circumstances,
the
first
two
tests
are
the
premerger
custom
in
the
nature
of
the
relief
granted.
to
my
way
of
thinking,
these
two
tests
really
embodied
the
traditional
historical
analytic
approach
that
this
court
has
adapted
in
its
cases
--
in
all
of
its
cases
determining
the
applicability
of
the
seventh
amendment.
there
are
two
ways
of
applying
the
first
test,
namely,
the
premerger
custom.
one
is
the
literal
approach
which
my
brother
--
and
suggests.
in
other
words,
you'll
look
at
the
common
laws
that
existed
in
1791
in
england
and
if
this
type
of
cause
of
action
did
not
exist
by
that
name
at
that
time,
then
you
have
no
seventh
amendment
right.
there
is
another
approach
and
that
is
the
approach
suggested
by
justice
story
in
parsons
versus
bedford,
and
that
case
which
was
cited
with
approval
in
ross
versus
bernhard.
justice
story
said
that
the
seventh
amendment,
the
preservative
power
of
the
seventh
amendment
reaches
all
lawsuits
except
those
which
are
of
equity
or
admiralty
jurisdiction.
in
other
words,
you
look
at
the
dichotomy
which
existed
in
england
between
the
law
and
equity
and
you
decide
not
necessarily
whether
this
particular
statutory
cause
of
action
existed
by
this
name
at
that
time,
but
really
what
jurisdiction
would
a
cause
of
action
such
as
this--
mr.
robert
scott
that's
right.
justice
field,
as
i
recall,
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
robert
scott
story,
that's
right,
but
i
think
you
are
right
about
the
dissent.
in
other
words,
if
you
apply
story’s
analysis,
you
go
beyond
the
literal
approach
to
determine
what
the
nature
of
this
cause
of
action
is.
and
again,
when
it
was
tried
it
was
an
action
for
damages,
compensatory
and
punitive
on
the
basis
of
a
civil
wrong.
our
argument
and
the
argument
adapted
by
the
seventh
circuit
was
that
that
particular
type
of
cause
of
action
would
certainly
have
belonged
in
the
law
side
in
england
in
1791.
go
on
to
the
next
test
which
is
probably
the
easiest
of
the
three.
the
relief
grant
--
requested
in
this
particular
case.
the
relief,
the
only
relief
which
was
tried
was
money
damages,
compensatory
and
punitive.
mr.
robert
scott
that's
right.
i'll
clarify
that
because
i
wanted
to
do
that
the
very
start
and
that
is
one
of
the
questions
that
the
seventh
circuit
went
at
us
with.
when
this
complaint
was
filed,
it
did
not
have
a
request
for
compensatory
damages
that
are
--
at
the
first
pretrial
conference,
they
interjected
that
they
would
like
to
include
a
claim
for
actual
damages.
by
that
time,
as
my
recollection
serves
me,
district
judge
reynolds
had
already
granted
his
injunctive
relief.
so
after
the
--
at
the
first
pretrial
conference,
this
came
up
and
when
i
was
explaining
this
to
the
seventh
circuit,
district
judge
candle
said,
“well,
it
can
be
brought
up
under
rule
16
in
that
fashion,
can
it?”
and
i
said
“well,
that
is
exactly
how
it
did
occur.”
and,
in
the
next
pretrial
order
that
issued
out
from
that
conference
the
district
judge
directed
that
the
trial
would
be
on
the
issue
of
actual
damages
and
discrimination,
and
this
was
formalized
--
mr.
robert
scott
there
was
never
a
formal
amendment
to
the
complaint.
mr.
robert
scott
thank
you.
mr.
robert
scott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon
in
the
course
of
his
discussion
of
this
case,
my
distinguished
opposing
counsel,
in
response
to
a
question
by
the
chief
justice
conceited
that
if
this
case
is
in
fact
in
a
nature
of
a
common
law
action
then
it
cannot
escape
the
reach
of
the
preservative
power
of
the
seventh
amendment.
when
court
adjourned
yesterday
afternoon,
in
response
to
another
question
by
the
chief
justice,
i
was
responding
to
how
the
seventh
amendment
test
may
be
applied
to
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case
and
i
would
like
to
pursue
that
further
this
morning.
when
we
adjourned
yesterday,
i
had
concluded
my
discussion
with
regard
to
the
first
test
announced
by
this
court
in
ross
versus
bernhard,
namely,
how
the
circumstances
of
this
case
compared
--
contrast
with
the
premerger
custom
of
the
federal
courts
with
respect
to
like
issues.
and,
i
suggested
to
the
court
the
test
proposed
by
justice
story
in
parsons
versus
bedford
to
the
effect
that
the
seventh
amendment
reaches
all
cases
which
are
not
of
equity
or
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
i
also
suggested
that
the
literal
approach
be
rejected.
and
i
would
pass
on
now
to
the
other
two
tests
which
were
announced
in
ross
versus
bernhard,
namely,
what
type
of
relief
is
requested
and,
thirdly,
third
test
being
the
practical
abilities
and
limitations
of
juries.
the
second
test,
i
think,
is
particularly
applicable
to
this
case
and
this
goes
back
to
a
question
that
justice
brennan
asked
me
yesterday
afternoon
with
respect
to
what
type
of
relief
was
asked
for.
i
recall
the
justice
asking
whether
or
not
actual
damages
had
been
asked
for
in
the
complaint
and
the
record
shows,
i
believe,
that
they
were
not.
however,
they
did
enter
the
case
by
way
of
a
pretrial
order
after
the
first
pretrial
conference
and,
in
all
subsequent
pretrial
orders
issued
by
the
district
court,
this
case
was
announced
to
be
one
on
damages.
and
when
it
came
time
for
this
case
to
be
decided
after
the
trial
had
been
concluded,
and
i
am
referring
specifically
to
page
51
(a)
of
the
appendix,
at
the
top
of
that
page,
the
district
court
said,
"now,
we
come
to
the
question,
the
questions
of
damages."
further
down
in
that
page
the
district
court
said,
"i
do
not
believe
there
had
been
any
compensatory
damages
proven
in
this
case
or
out
of
pocket
expenses
of
that
nature."
and
so
he
rejected
the
claim
for
compensatory
damages.
there
had
been
a
trial
on
compensatory
damages.
all
the
evidence
elicited
by
the
plaintiff
on
direct
testimony
had
related
to
actual
damages.
the
plaintiff
offered
no
testimony
with
respect
to
the
other
issue
that
was
being
tried,
namely
the
issue
of
discrimination,
because
the
court
had
incorporated
the
testimony
that
had
been
elicited
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
injunction
on
that
issue.
practically,
the
entire
testimony
in
that
two
days
of
trial
related
to
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
if
at
all,
the
plaintiff
had
sustained
any
actual
damages.
and
in
the
final
analysis,
very
specifically,
the
trial
court
rejected
that
claim
and
went
on
to
award
punitive
damages
in
the
amount
of
$250.
and
this
was
a
--
this
topic
was
a
source
of
some
discussion
when
this
case
was
argued
before
the
seventh
circuit
and
at
that
time,
opposing
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
conceited
to
the
seventh
circuit
that
actual
damages
were
in
the
case.
now,
why
is
this
important
with
respect
to
the
second
issue
in
ross
versus
bernhard?
you
look
to
see
what
type
of
relief
is
requested,
particularly
at
the
time
when
the
availability
of
a
jury
becomes
important
to
determine
the
reach
of
the
seventh
amendment
at
least
in
part.
and
there
are
two
reasons
at
least
why
the
type
of
relief
requested
is
important
to
the
jury
issue
cause
it
goes
to
the
abilities
of
juries.
and
i'd
point
this
out
that
we
had
two
claims
for
money
damages;
actual
damages,
punitive
damages.
both
of
those
are
issues
that
juries
are
particularly
responsive
to
particularly
in
determining
the
extent
of
damages.
this
is
one
area
where
appellate
courts,
i
find
are
laws
overturn,
the
finding
of
juries
because
that
is
one
of
their
particular
strengths
and
i
think
there
is
probably
no
damage
issue
at
law
that
calls
upon
the
common
sense
judgment
of
jurors
more
than
the
question
of
whether,
and
to
what
extent,
punitive
damages
should
be
awarded.
both
of
these
damage
issues
were
before
us
at
the
time
the
jury
trial
issue
became
critical.
mr.
robert
scott
exactly.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
referred
specifically
to
those
types
of
action
in
my
brief
and
to
the
fact
that
previously
this
court
has
held,
and
i
think,
specifically
in
ross
versus
bernhard,
those
types
of
issues
were
mentioned
as
ones
to
which
the
seventh
amendment
reaches,
in
which
the
jury
right
is
preserved.
we
pass
on,
if
i
may,
to
the
third
test
in
ross
versus
bernhard.
this
is
the
test
which
was
described
as
being
the
practical
abilities
and
limitations
of
juries.
i
feel,
in
some
regard,
this
is
the
real
battleground
to
this
case.
that
test
is
--
as
i
read
ross,
was
not
applied
in
ross.
in
my
brief,
i
suggested
that
the
test
includes
at
least
two
considerations.
one
is
the
consideration
of
whether
or
not
juries,
given
the
particular
issues
that
are
going
to
be
tried,
can
deal
competently
and
justly
with
those
particular
issues.
brings
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
issues
are
very
complicated
or,
for
other
policy
reasons,
might
best
be
withdrawn
from
juries.
and
i
would
suggest
there
is
another
consideration
included
in
that
third
criteria
set
down
in
ross,
namely,
whether
or
not
this
particular
cause
of
action
with
a
jury
trial
right
attached
to
it
will
frustrate
any
particular
statutory
purpose
or
frustrate
any
particular
statutory
scheme.
and
i
am
thinking
particularly
in
this
regard
of
katchen,
and
i
will
get
to
that
point
after
discussing
the
first
consideration,
if
i
may,
because
i
want
to
suggest
that
in
terms
of
the
competence
of
juries
this
case
is
an
excellent
example
of
just
the
type
of
issue
that
should
go
to
jury
consideration
because
what's
going
to
be
tried
here
are
questions
of
credibility
and
motivation.
this
trial,
on
the
discrimination
issue
particularly,
involved
whether
or
not
at
the
time
leroy
loether
determined
not
to
rent
one
of
the
two
flats
in
the
two-flat
home
that
he
happened
to
own
to
the
plaintiff,
whether
or
not
at
that
time
his
motivation
was
based
on
race
or
based
solely
on
other
considerations.
leroy
loether
testified
at
this
trial.
his
wife
testified.
to
the
--
two
of
them
owned
the
house
together.
and
what
was
called
upon
for
a
determination
of
the
discrimination
issue
was
a
testing
of
their
credibility,
and
this
is
an
area
where
there
is
particular
strength
of
jurors.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
he
had
a
racial
motivation.
he
said
he
didn't.
he
said
it
was
because
of
something
else.
he
said
if
the
same
circumstances
had
been
presented
and
district
judge
reynolds
had
been
the
applicant
for
the
apartment,
he
would
have
refused
him
in
those
circumstances.
this
was
his
testimony
on
cross-examination
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
robert
scott
right.
that's
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
further
response
to
that,
i
believe
we've
made
that
concession
down
the
line
in
the
previous
hearings
on
this
issue.
injunctive
relief
was
asked
for
at
the
outset
and
just
--
to
put
this
a
little
bit
in
perspective,
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
asked
for.
it
was
granted
before
the
first
hearing.
a
preliminary
injunction
was
requested
to
follow
up
the
tro.
we
had
a
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
and
that
injunction
was
granted
by
order
of
the
district
court
on
december
19,
1969
very
briefly
after
the
action
had
been
started
in
november.
the
following
month,
in
january
of
1970,
we
were
advised
in
a
pretrial
conference
that
the
plaintiff
no
longer
wish
to
occupy
the
apartment
and
at
that
time,
a
proposal
was
made
with
the
court's
concurrence
that
the
matter
be
resolved
by
renting
to
any
black
family
or
any
black
individual.
and,
at
the
time
we
returned
to
argue
the
jury
trial
issue
to
the
district
court
in
april
1970,
the
plaintiff's
counsel
reported
back
that
that
particular
offer
had
been
rejected
by
the
plaintiff
and
at
that
time,
the
injunctive
relief
was
abandoned.
and
so
when
this
case
went
to
trial,
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
injunctive
relief
that
was
requested.
all
that
was
asked
for
by
way
of
relief
was
in
terms
of
money
damages,
both
punitive
and
compensatory.
mr.
robert
scott
preliminary
injunction
was
dissolved
with
the
consent
of
the
plaintiff,
your
honor.
it
was
dissolved
in
april
of
1970
after
the
plaintiff
rejected
our
proposal
for
resolving
the
case.
mr.
robert
scott
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
scott
i'm
fairly
sure
it
is
in
the
appendix.
i
know
--
mr.
robert
scott
that
it's
in
the
record
because
i
argued
the
matter
on
the
jury
trial
issue
to
the
district
court
on
that
april
day
in
1970
when
it
was
decided,
and
i
believe
i
have
a
record
cite
or
appendix
cite
in
my
brief.
mr.
robert
scott
all
right.
i
don't
want
to
go
beyond
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
scott
we
had
a
fairly
elaborate
hearing
on
that,
your
honor,
and
certainly,
the
court
was
called
upon
to
make
a
determination
but
it
was
not
a
binding
determination
on
the
merits.
and,
this
is
why
i
would
argue
that
the
availability
of
a
jury
in
this
case
does
not
frustrate
the
need
for
speed
of
relief.
mr.
robert
scott
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
scott
yes,
your
honor.
if
a
permanent
injunction
had
been
requested
in
this
case
together
with
the
other
elements
of
relief,
then
i
would
be
still
before
you
this
morning
arguing
that
the
seventh
amendment
reaches
that.
mr.
robert
scott
no,
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
two
full
trials.
you'd
have
to
have
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
discrimination,
on
the
issue
of
damages
and
the
issues
of
fact
would
be
directed
to
the
jury.
mr.
robert
scott
they'd
be
different
in
what
regard?
the
issues
of
fact
would
be
the
same.
mr.
robert
scott
would
what
be
different?
i'm
afraid
i
do
not
follow
you.
mr.
robert
scott
no.
mr.
robert
scott
it's
exactly
the
same.
mr.
robert
scott
we're
not
proposing
two
trials.
well,
i
thought
you
said
if
he
got
a
permanent
injunction
he
still
would
have
to
have
a
trial
on
damages.
mr.
robert
scott
we
had
a
request
for
permanent
injunction,
all
factual
issues.
i
believe
this
is
the
teaching
of
the
case,
it's
under
the
seventh
amendment.
all
factual
issues
would
be
addressed
to
the
jury.
they
would
have
to
determine
in
the
first
instance,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
there
is
any
discrimination.
mr.
robert
scott
no,
it
is
not.
but
it
is
--
mr.
robert
scott
that
are
common.
mr.
robert
scott
that's
my
position.
mr.
robert
scott
i'm
aware
of
your
dissent
in
the
laws.
mr.
robert
scott
no,
i
say
that
this
court
has
said
it
and
has
said
it
repeatedly.
mr.
robert
scott
no,
i
don't
believe
section
812
is
unconstitutional.
in
the
seventh
amendment
--
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
robert
scott
and
i
would
argue
that
that
use
of
the
term
"the
court"
is
an
institutional
reference
and
i
would
--
mr.
robert
scott
if
812
can
be
properly
read
to
exclude
the
right
to
a
jury
on
the
factual
issues
pertaining
to
a
case
that
involves
common
law
issues,
then
812
is
unconstitutional.
that
issue
was
avoided
by
the
seventh
circuit,
by
another
reading
of
that
section.
and
to
a
certain
extent,
their
position
was
supported
by
the
only
legislative
history
that
has
been
brought
into
this
record
and
that
is
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general
katzenbach
at
the
time
this
case
or
this
issue
--
that
the
statute
was
an
issue
before
the
congress.
and,
i
refer
specifically
to
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
15
and
16
where
senator
irvin
asked
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
objection
to
having
the
statute
amended
to
spell
out
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
have
the
issues
of
fact
tried
to
a
jury
when
there's
a
damage
issue.
and,
the
attorney
general
said,
"no."
on
the
damage
suit,
i
have
no
objection
to
that.
that's
the
only
legislative
history
we've
got
in
the
record
on
this
case
and
i
think
it
supports
an
appropriate
reading
of
812
and
that
is
that
it's
silent
on
the
jury
trial
issue
and
you
can
avoid
ruling
that
that
statute
is
unconstitutional.
as
i've
said,
i
believe
that
this
case
is
particularly
appropriate
for
jury
determination
because
of
the
issues
of
credibility.
i
had
also
urged
that
this
statute
with
the
jury
trial
right
attached
to
it
under
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
frustrate
any
statutory
scheme
in
any
of
the
regard
suggested
in
the
cases
of
katchen
versus
landy
or
jones
&
laughlin
versus
nlrb
or
nlrb
versus
jones
&
laughlin.
and
i
distinguish
in
my
brief
the
katchen
case
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
in
that
case,
namely,
what
the
court
was
dealing
with,
there
was
a
very
specific
summary
type
of
proceeding.
.
and,
in
katchen,
justice
white
distinguished
between
the
summary
proceeding
of
bankruptcy
and
the
plenary
proceeding.
mr.
robert
scott
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
distinction
was
made
in
that
case
by
the
court.
and
i
believe
the
distinction
is
important
to
our
case
because
what
we
have
here
is
a
civil
action
established
by
congress
as
such
with
all
of
the
(inaudible),
an
ordinary
lawsuit
accompanying
it
at
the
time
of
trial,
pretrial
conferences,
pretrial
orders,
or
regular
trial,
not
a
summary
proceeding,
an
informal
proceeding
such
as
that
provided
for
in
the
bankruptcy
statute
for
summary
proceeding.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
said
that
katchen
was
dispositive
of
our
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
katchen
and
nlrb
versus
jones
&
laughlin
are
quite
distinguishable.
they
involve
what
was
referred
to
in
nlrb
versus
jones
&
laughlin
as
a
statutory
proceeding.
we
have
a
civil
action
very
much
like
an
ordinary
lawsuit.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
here
provides
for
an
alternate
proceeding
that
is
really
quite
a
bit
more
like
the
summary
proceeding
than
our
civil
action
we
have
here.
and
that's
the
proceeding
by
which
an
aggrieved
party
can
apply
to
the
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
for
conciliation
and
it
provides
the
secretary
with
a
vast
panoply
of
discovery
