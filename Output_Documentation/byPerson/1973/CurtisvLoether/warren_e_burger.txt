chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-1035,
rogers
against
loether.
we'll
wait
for
the
two
months
to
die
down,
mr.
greenberg.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
greenberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
how
does
that
help
you
very
much,
mr.
greenberg,
when
it's
--
of
course
the
jury
doesn't
engage
in
granting
injunctions
ever?
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
need
to
--
do
you
need
to
rest
on
that
so
firmly,
mr.
greenberg?
isn't
it
a
more
important
to
question
whether
this
is
or
is
not
a
common
law
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
mean
to
disrupt
the
order
of
your
argument
but
then
you
just
do
it
in
your
own
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
--
if
mr.
greenberg,
it
is
a
common
law
action.
assume
that
hypothetically
for
the
moment.
could
congress
deny
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
scott.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
going
to
the
seventh
amendment
itself,
what
do
you
think
the
seventh
amendment
means
when
it
says,
“in
all
common
law
action,”
if
that's
the
language
i
think
it
is,
“in
all
common
law
action”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
arguments
in
rogers
against
loether.
mr.
scott,
you
have
21
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that,
in
this
respect,
there
are
some
analogies
between
this
kind
of
an
action
and
a
libel
or
slander
suit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
scott,
you
a
--
you've
emphasized
the
credibility
issues
one
in
a
particular
way
for
12
jurors
rather
than
a
single
judge
but
all
those
credibility
issues
were
presented
in
connection
with
the
equitable
relief
or
an
injunction,
were
they
not?
and
the
judge
tried
those
issues.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
--
when
a
permanent
injunction
is
entered
that's
done
by
a
judge
acting
alone,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible).
mr.
greenberg,
you
have
about
10
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
it
is
more
a
delicate,
more
complicated
than
the
function
the
jury
undertakes
in
a
libel
or
slander
case
where
it
must
evaluate
malice
or
recklessness
or
motives
and
all
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
a
separate
route,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
much
like
a
pretrial
settlement
conference,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
we
have
appointment
of
counsel
in
our
criminal
case
where
there
is
a
jury.
that
doesn't
give
any
difficulty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
some
things
the
judge
does
alone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
greenberg,
when
the
state
courts
have
--
has
a
good
many
of
them
have
done,
stricken
down
sovereign
immunity
and
allowed
civil
action
for
damages
against
a
municipal
corporation
or
a
state,
would
you
say
that
that
was
a
common
law
action
that
was
then
arising?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
are
created
by
--
by
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
--
they're
comparable
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
the
states
have
set
aside
sovereign
immunity
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
common
law
actions
arose,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
bivens
case?
there
was
some
reference
to
that
yesterday
and
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
take
a
fresh
look
at
it
this
morning.
in
the
bivens
case
when
the
court
in
exercise
of
the
common
law
function
created
a
new
cause
of
action
is
there
--
that
--
that's
a
case
tried
by
a
jury,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
just
--
i'm
addressing
myself
only
to
the
constitutional
aspect
now,
not
the
construction
of
the
statute,
that's
a
separate
question.
but
i
think
it
is
probably
quite
clear
that
the
bivens
case,
in
creating
that
new
cause
of
action,
and
must
have
created
an
action
which
is
triable
to
a
jury.
although,
i
think
the
opinion
was
solid
on
the
subject.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
greenberg.
thank
you,
mr.
scott.
the
case
is
submitted.
