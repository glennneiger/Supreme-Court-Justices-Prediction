mr.
george
cooper
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
me
today
is
my
co-counsel
in
this
case,
mr.
ruben
montemayor
of
san
antonio,
texas.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
mrs.
espinoza,
is
a
lawfully
admitted,
permanent
resident
alien
of
the
united
states.
she
is
married
to
an
american
citizen
and
has
two
children
who
are
american
citizens.
she
applied
for
a
job
and
was
denied
the
job
solely
because
she,
herself
is
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
an
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
this
form
of
exclusion
or
discrimination
against
mrs.
espinoza
is
prohibited
by
federal
civil
rights
act.
the
primary
construction
--
the
primary
construction
to
be
made
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
origin
discrimination
prohibition
in
title
vii
applies
to
bar
this
form
of
exclusion.
in
beginning
the
argument,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
clarify
exactly
what
our
position
is
and
remove
some
distractions
from
the
case.
first
of
all,
it
should
be
clear
that
there
is
no
question
whatever
that
aliens,
as
persons
or
individuals,
are
in
fact
protected
by
title
vii.
the
scope
of
title
vii
is
not
limited
to
citizens
that
includes
aliens,
non-citizens
as
well.
the
only
question
is,
what
they
are
protected
against.
second,
your
honors,
and
this
is
most
important
because
it’s
an
element
of
confusion
in
the
case
for
many
persons,
myself
for
a
long
time
included.
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
in
ruling
in
our
favor
on
the
title
vii
argument.
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
find
that
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
citizenship
or
nationality
is
in
its
own
terms
prohibited
by
title
vii.
our
basic
position
is
that
citizenship
discrimination
is
prohibited.
our
basic
position
is
that
title
vii
bars
national
origin
discrimination
and
that
phrase
should
be
interpreted
to
cover
any
non-merit
related
discrimination
on
any
ground
which
relates
to
national
origin
and
nationality
so
relates.
nationality
is
non-related
to
merit
in
performing
a
job.
it
is
related
to
national
origin
and
therefore
discrimination
on
grounds
of
nationality
should
be
interpreted
as
covered
by
title
vii.
but,
we
do
not
press,
your
honors,
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
it
is
not
necessary
because
whether
or
not,
title
vii
--
the
national
origin
phrase
in
title
vii,
whether
or
not
that
is
interpreted
to
include
nationality,
it
should
be
clear
that
the
citizenship
requirement
of
farah
is
a
requirement
which
has
a
discriminatory
impact
in
terms
of
national
origin.
the
citizenship
requirement
is
like
the
test
or
a
high
school
diploma
requirement
that
was
before
this
court
in
griggs
against
duke
power
company.
it
is
standard
which
although
it
may
be
neutral
on
its
face,
it’s
a
standard
which
has
a
definite
and
decided
adverse
impact
in
national
origin
terms
and
that
impact
alone
is
ample
to
cause
the
citizenship
standard
to
be
declared
unlawful.
there
are
two
ways
in
which
the
citizenship
requirement
has
this
adverse
effect
in
national
origin
terms.
first,
it
has
an
adverse
impact
directly
related
to
a
person’s
place
of
birth.
one
aspect
of
national
origin,
taking
the
term
national
origin
simply
and
literally,
one
aspect
of
someone’s
national
origin
is
where
they
themselves
originate
--
where
they
themselves
are
born.
the
respondents
apparently
would
deny
or
ignore
that
fact
and
say
that
national
origin
means
ethnic
origin.
but
the
statute
doesn’t
say
that.
the
statute
doesn’t
say
ethnic
origins.
there’s
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
that
says
ethnic
origins.
the
statute
says
national
origins
and
there
are
various
aspects
of
national
origin.
one
aspect
of
a
person’s
national
origin
is
where
his
ancestors,
his
forbearers
come
from,
his
ethnic
origins.
but
another
aspect
of
an
individual’s
national
origin
is
where
he
himself
comes
from.
and
if
an
employer
discriminates
against
an
individual
because
of
his
birthplace,
he
is
discriminating
in
national
origin
terms
and
his
act
should
be
prohibited
by
the
statute.
now,
farah
manufacturing
company
has
not
gone
so
far
as
to
openly
and
clearly
discriminating
terms
of
place
of
birth.
we
admit
that.
they
don’t
say,
“we
hire
only
people
born
in
the
united
states
and
no
one
born
abroad.”
if
they
had
said
that,
i
think
it
would
be
--
the
case
would
be
easy.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your--
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
most
of
the
farah
employees
are
born
in
this
country.
they
do
have
some--
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
they
have
a
--
most
of
the
farah
employees
are
born
in
this
country
but
they
don’t
restrict
their
employment
to
only
persons
born
in
this
country.
they
restrict
the
employment
to
citizens
and
of
course,
some
citizens
are
persons
who
were
born
abroad,
but
that
doesn’t
alter
the
fact
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
a
requirement
which
has
a
definite,
clear
mark
decided,
adverse
impact
in
terms
of
a
person’s
place
of
birth.
if
you
are
born
in
one
place,
the
united
states,
the
citizenship
requirement
is
essentially
meaningless
to
you.
your
citizenship
has
been
handed
to
you
by
virtue
of
your
birth.
but
if
you
were
born
any
other
place,
but
in
the
united
states,
you
must
undergo
a
serious
and
restrictive
and
difficult
process
to
gain
citizenship,
the
process
of
naturalization.
and
any
standard
which
imposes
a
harsher,
more
difficult
burden
on
persons
because
of
their
place
of
birth
is
a
standard
which
has
a
discriminatory
impact
in
terms
of
the
individual’s
national
origin.
mr.
george
cooper
persons
born
in
texas,
your
honor?
mr.
george
cooper
well,
that
would
not
relate
--
that
would
not
relate
to
national
origin
in
terms
of
the
way
it
excluded
other
people
from
other
parts
of
the
united
states
but
it
would
relate
to
national
origin
in
terms
of
discriminating
against
persons
of
foreign
birth
and
we
would
have
to
assess
the
national
origin
impact
of
that.
is
the
impact
of
a
texas
restriction,
a
restriction
which
has
a
harsher
effect
on
a
foreign
born
than
the
american
born.
that
would
be
a
question
which
we
have
to
pursue.
i’m
not
sure
what
the
facts
would
show.
but
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
a
requirement
which
imposes
a
very
differential
burden
on
the
american
born
as
compared
to
the
foreign
born.
it’s
just
like
the
test
in
the
griggs
case.
the
test
was
one
which
was
given
to
whites
and
blacks.
it
didn’t
exclude
all
blacks
just
like
the
citizenship
requirement,
it
doesn’t
exclude
all
foreign
born
persons,
but
the
test
was
one
which
the
blacks
had
a
more
difficult
time
passing.
the
test
was
something
which
operated
as
a
built-in
headwind
against
the
blacks
and
it’s
that
built-in
headwind
making
it
more
difficult
for
blacks
in
practice
than
whites
to
get
jobs
which
caused
the
test
to
be
declared
unlawful
in
griggs
and
so
to
the
citizenship
requirement
which
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
foreign
born
to
get
a
job
than
for
the
native
born
to
get
a
job.
it’s
a
discrimination.
it’s
a
standard
which
has
a
discriminatory
impact
in
national
origin
terms
to
the
extent
that
national
origin
relates
to
an
individual’s
birthplace.
we
think
that
point
is
simple
and
clear
and
that
alone
is
a
sufficient
ground
to
sustain
us,
your
honor.
but,
if
there
are
no
questions
on
that
point,
let
me
go
on
to
our
second
point.
that
is
that
even
if
the
court
wishes
to
ignore
this
discrimination
in
terms
of
place
of
birth
which
is
the
effect
of
the
citizenship
rule.
if
the
court
wants
instead
merely
to
look
at
ethnic
discrimination,
which
is
what
the
respondents
urge,
nonetheless,
the
citizenship
requirement
has
a
discriminatory
impact,
a
discriminatory
effect
in
terms
of
an
individual’s
ethnic
background.
the
citizenship
requirement
does
not
in
practice
and
effect
apply
to
all
ethnic
groups
equally.
rather,
it
imposes
a
harsher
burden
on
some
ethnic
groups
than
on
other
ethnic
groups
which
proves--
mr.
george
cooper
your
honor,
the
ethnic
group
changes
from
time
to
time.
the
ethnic
group
which
is
most
harshly
affected
by
a
citizenship
requirement
is
the
ethnic
group
at
a
particular
time
and
place
which
is
most
heavily
made
up
of
recent
immigrants.
in
boston
in
1850,
the
ethnic
group--
mr.
george
cooper
now
and--
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cooper
your
honor,
in
terms--
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
the
two
separate
ethnic
groups
if
we’re
talking
in
ethnic
terms,
without
regard
the
birthplace.
the
different
ethnic
groups
are
mexican
on
the
one
hand,
polish
on
the
other
hand,
italian
on
the
other
hand--
those
ethnic.
now,
when
i’m
talking
ethnic
groups,
i’m
talking
in
those
terms
now.
if
one
wants
to
look
at
that
aspect
of
national
origin,
and
again,
remember
that
that’s
only
one
aspect
of
national
origin.
our
basic
position
is
that
there’s
more
than
one
aspect
and
birthplace
is
a
separate
independent
aspect.
but
we
will
look
at
ethnic
background,
that
aspect
of
national
origin.
the
citizenship
requirement
in
texas
right
now,
primarily
hurts
mexicans.
in
san
francisco,
it
primarily
hurts
orientals
and
mexicans.
in
boston
in
1850,
it
would’ve
primarily
hurt
the
irish.
in
each
cases,
citizenship--
mr.
george
cooper
because
mexicans
--
because
the
ethnic
group
which
is
most
heavily
represented
in
the
non-citizen
category
--
the
ethnic
group
which
is
most
heavily
made
up
of
recent
immigrants.
in
texas
right
now,
it's
mexicans,
80%
of
the
alien
residents
in
san
antonio,
70%
to
80%
are
mexicans.
so,
to
impose
an
anti-alien
rule,
the
primary
people
you
hurt
are
the
mexicans
and
that
will
always
be
the
case.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
you
only
hurt
the
mexicans
who
aren’t
naturalized.
that’s
right.
in
each
case,
you
only
hurt
the
people
who
are
naturalized
but
what’s
the
effect
of
the
rule?
in
the
griggs
case,
the
only
people
you
hurt
were
the
blacks
that
couldn’t
pass
the
test
but
that
wasn’t
the
way
the
court
looked
at
it.
the
court
said,
to
the
extent--
mr.
george
cooper
well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
reasons
why
people
aren’t
naturalized.
one
is
because
they
don’t
bother
to
do
it.
the
other
is
because
they
can’t
do
it
and
there
are
many
reasons
why
you
can’t
do
it
starting
from
the
fact
that
you
may
not
have
lived
in
the
county
long
enough.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
she
doesn’t
speak
english.
and
one
of
the
requirements
--
one
of
the
requirements
for
naturalization
is
--
mr.
george
cooper
yes.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
and
she
has
not
yet
learned
english.
the
record
indicates
that
she’s
in
the
process
of
trying
to
learn
english.
she’s
in
the
process
of
pursuing
citizenship
but
she
has
not
acquired
the
ability
to
pursue
citizenship.
but
she’s
not
the
only
person
who
can’t
speak
english.
there
are
many
people
who
are
us
citizens
who
can’t
speak
english.
the
us
citizens
from
puerto
rico,
most
of
them
or
many
of
them
can’t
speak
english.
the
mere
fact
that
you
can’t
speak
english
doesn’t
necessarily
preclude
you
from
being
a
citizen
unless
you
were
born
abroad.
and
it
certainly
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
this
job
here.
the
important
fact
is
that--
mr.
george
cooper
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
this
--
no,
it
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
this
job
and
that’s
--
and
that’s
of
course
crucial
to
the
extent
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
unlawful
because
of
its
discriminatory
impact
--
discriminatory
effects.
we
don’t
say
that
it’s
per
se
unlawful.
we
say
rather
that
it’s
unlawful
unless
the
particular
employer
can
show
some
job
relatedness
to
it
and
in
this
case,
there’s
not
a
slightest
suggestion
that
being
a
citizen
or
speaking
english
or
being
anything
else
with
regard
to
citizenship
has
anything
to
do
with
the
job
which
is
running
a
sewing
machine
in
a
pants
factory.
in
terms
of
ethnic
discrimination,
again,
the
point
is,
your
honors,
that
in
each
case,
the
effect
of
a
citizenship
requirement
will
be
to
discriminate
against
the
particular
group
which
predominates
in
the
alien
population
at
the
time
and
that
is
the
group
which
at
the
time
is
most
vulnerable
to
national
origin
discrimination.
the
use
of
a
citizenship
requirement
mirrors
the
national
origin
discrimination
in
the
country
at
the
particular
time.
and
because
of
that
--
because
the
effect
of
the
citizenship
requirement,
is
to
single
out
and
have
primary
impact
on
the
particular
group
which
is
primarily
recent
immigrants
at
a
particular
time.
the
effect
of
it
is
to
impose
a
disproportionate
burden
on
certain
ethnic
groups
--
the
most
vulnerable
ethnic
group
at
the
time
and
place.
and
that
impact
also
makes
--
also
causes
national
origin
discrimination.
now
your
honors,
in
response
to
these
two
arguments
on
our
part,
the
arguments
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
a
test,
a
standard
which
has
discriminatory
effects
in
terms
of
place
of
birth.
it
singles
out
american
born
people
and
favors
them
as
compared
to
foreign
born
people
or
the
fact
that
it
singles
out
long-time
established
ethnic
groups
and
prefers
them
to
recent
immigrant
ethnic
groups.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
being
able
to
become
a
permanent
resident
alien,
there
are
various
ways
in
which
you
can
do
that.
the
way
in
which--
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
she
has
to
go
--
she
has
to
meet
the
same
requirements
for
citizenship.
mr.
george
cooper
it
ignored
the--
mr.
george
cooper
there
may
be
some
modifications
in
the
process
because
of
the
fact
that
she
acquired
her
permanent
resident
status
through
her
marriage
with
an
american
citizen,
but
she
is
not
exempted
from
the
learning
of
history
requirements,
from
the
english
language
requirements
and
those
requirements
of
citizenship.
the
only
response
which
the
respondent
has
to
our
claims
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
a
standard
which
has
adverse
special
extra
effects
on
people
born
abroad,
special
burdens
on
the
foreign
born
or
on
certain
ethnic
groups,
the
recent
immigrant
ethnic
groups.
the
only
response
they
have
to
that
is
to
say,
“well,
that
may
be
true
that
that
form
of
discrimination
is
unlawful
in
some
cases”
that
discriminatory
effect,
but
it’s
not
unlawful
in
our
case
because
we
hire
a
lot
of
mexicans.
we
hire
a
lot
of
mexicans
who
are
citizens.
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
answer
is
inadequate.
first
of
all,
to
the
extent
that
the
unlawful
aspect
of
the
discrimination
is
its
special
burden
on
the
foreign
born,
its
differential
treatment
of
the
foreign
born
as
compared
to
the
american
born.
the
hiring
of
mexicans
who
are
american
born
is
no
defense
at
all.
it’s
essentially
an
irrelevant
answer.
now,
if
we
turn
to
the
second
way
of
looking
at
this
case,
analyzing
in
terms
of
the
ethnic
effect
rather
than
the
birthplace
effect,
it’s
also
not
a
sufficient
answer
to
say,
“we
hire
a
lot
of
mexicans”
because
the
respondent
has
not
established,
first
of
all,
that
his
hiring
of
a
lot
of
mexicans
means
that
he
hires
other
ethnic
groups
which
may
be
adversely
affected
by
the
citizenship
requirement.
second,
it
says
nothing
about
whether
or
not
at
least
one
more
person
of
mexican
background
might
not
have
been
hired
had
he
not
imposed
the
citizenship
requirement.
and
that’s
all
it
takes,
your
honors.
all
it
takes
is
the
possibility
that
one
more
mexican
might
have
been
hired.
that’s
all
it
takes
to
justify
holding
the
standard
unlawful
because
we
are
not
here
talking
about
any
kind
of
standards
which
has
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
job-relatedness,
merit
or
ability.
we’re
talking
about
a
wholly
arbitrary
standard
which
the
employer
has
not
attempted
to
justify
at
all,
and
even
at
the
minimized
discriminatory
effect
should
be
enough
to
declare
that
kind
of
requirement
unlawful.
so,
for
those
two
reasons,
the
discriminatory
effect,
the
special
burden
which
just
imposes
on
a
foreign
born
and
also
because
of
the
discriminatory
effect
and
special
burden
that
this
imposes
on
recent
immigrant
groups,
not
that
the
citizenship
requirement
should
be
declared
unlawful
under
the
general
standard
of
the
griggs
against
duke
power
company
case
that
any
special
requirement
or
hurdle
which
is
non-job
related.
this
certainly
declared
--
mr.
george
cooper
the
first
one
clearly
is.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
second
one
is
not
present
to
an
obvious
extent.
it
may
be
present.
we
don’t
know
how
many
mexicans.
we
do
know
that
the
company
employs
more
than
90%
mexicans.
mr.
george
cooper
as
it
varies
from
plan
to
plan.
we
do
know
that
but
we
don’t
know
whether
or
not
there
might
have
been
one
more
mexican
without
this
discriminatory
effect.
the
same
kind
of
argument
--
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
the
respondent
has
claimed
that,
but
there
is
in
fact
nothing
--
no
credible
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
--
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
the
probabilities
are
clearly
true.
but,
the
same
kind
of
issue
was
presented
to
this
case,
in
this
court
in
the
phillips
versus
martin
marietta
case,
the
case
involving
sex
discrimination
against
women
with
small
children.
the
employer
in
that
case
said
that
--
well,
he
admitted
that
his
requirement
had
a
discriminatory
effect
on
women
but
he
then
went
on
to
point
that
he
hired
70
to
80%
women.
mr.
george
cooper
and
therefore
--
he
more
then
made
up
for
whatever
discriminatory
effect
he
might
have
caused.
and
the
court
essentially
ignored
that
argument
and
properly
so,
because
it’s
not
--
what
i
might
call
the
code
of
defense
argument.
i
can
discriminate
so
long
as
i
make
up
for
it
with
some
other
positive
discrimination.
that’s
an
argument
which
seems
to
us
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
basic
purpose
of
title
vii
to
bring
about
the
hiring
of
individuals
on
the
basis
of
their
own
merit
and
not
on
the
basis
of
codes.
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
correctly
points
out
--
to
the
extent,
we’re
talking
about
the
first
effect,
the
effect
in
terms
of
birthplace,
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
hiring
of
mexican
citizens
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
and
indeed,
most
of
the
mexicans
hired
are
native-born
mexicans.
we
look
in
terms
of
birthplace.
there
are
very
few
naturalized
mexicans
in
san
antonio.
mr.
george
cooper
pardon.
mr.
george
cooper
the
percentage
of
naturalized
mexicans
as
compared
to
native
born
mexicans
in
san
antonio,
there’s
no
doubt
in
the
record
on
that,
your
honor.
the
census
figures
--
mr.
george
cooper
the
data
on
the
percentage
of
naturalized
citizens
--
the
data
on
the
percentage
of
mexicans
and
so
on
is
not
in
the
records
derived
from
the
census
department
figures.
mr.
george
cooper
that’s
right.
mr.
george
cooper
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cooper
no.
i’m
not--i’m
not--
mr.
george
cooper
no.
the
only
point
i
was
making
was
that
to
the
extent
that
farah
employs
mexicans.
most
of
the
people
who
it
employs
are
probably
native-born
mexicans
rather
than
naturalized
mexicans.
mr.
george
cooper
mexicans
who
were
--
he
hires
only
--
mr.
george
cooper
excuse
me.
no,
okay.
sorry,
i
should
have
stated
it
differently.
he
hires
primarily
mexicans
who
are
native
born
in
the
united
states,
persons
of
mexican
background
who
were
born
in
the
united
states.
there’s
nothing
on
the
record
on
that.
mr.
george
cooper
the
census
figures
indicated
only
something
like
30,000
out
of
almost
400,000
mexicans
in
san
antonio
are
foreign
born.
and,
that’s
our
basic
title
vii
case,
your
honors.
we
also
make
an
argument
under
section
1981
of
1442
usc
and
there
of
course,
the
argument
is
much
more
straightforward.
section
1981
clearly
prohibits
discrimination
against
aliens
as
compared
to
citizens.
the
language
in
the
statute
is
very
clear.
and
as
that
argument
prepared
in
the
rest
in
our
brief,
just
make
one
point
to
the
court
--
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
that’s
the
point
i
was
about
to
make.
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
discussed
or
argued
in
the
lower
courts
as
such.
they
were
referenced
to
jones
against
meyer,
references
to
things
mentioning
the
statute
but
the
argument
was
not
presented
as
such
and
it’s
relevant
to
this
case
--
only
relevant
to
this
case
in
three
different
ways.
one,
it
certainly
bears
upon
the
general
statutory
provisions
with
regard
the
protection
of
aliens,
and
to
that
extent,
relevant
to
the
construction
of
title
vii.
that’s
its
primary
purpose
here.
secondly,
it
does
provide
an
alternative
basis
for
this
court’s
decision
if
this
court
should
wish
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
case
from
section
1981.
and
thirdly,
and
i
express
this
only
as
a
caution
on
our
part,
if
in
fact
the
court
decides
against
this
on
the
title
vii
ground
and
does
not
want
to
reach
the
1981
issue,
we
just
ask
that
the
court
not
take
any
action
which
will
preclude
us
for
raising
the
issue
in
the
case
on
remand
because
the
case
is
here
now
only
on
a
denial
motion
and
for
summary
judgment,
and
on
remand,
the
case
will
still
be
alive
for
further
action.
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
we
admit
that
she
was
discriminated
against
because
of
her
non-citizen
status.
that’s
a
pro-citizen
discrimination.
our
basic
point
is
that
nonetheless,
since
the
effect
of
discriminating
against
people
because
of
lack
of
citizenship
is
to
impose
a
special
burden
and
to
make
it,
to
lay
down
a
built-in
headwind
for
foreign
born
people.
the
citizenship
requirement
is
unlawful.
the
statute
in
griggs
--
the
statute
didn’t
prohibit
test
requirements.
the
individual
in
griggs
was
denied
a
job
because
he
failed
a
test
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
you
can't
deny
a
person
a
job
because
they
failed
the
test
if
the
test
is
one
which
has
a
discriminatory
impact
on
protected
groups.
and
so
to
hear,
mrs.
espinoza’s
denied
a
job
because
of
her
lack
of
citizenship.
her
lack
of
citizenship
is
a
neutral
requirement
but
it’s
a
requirement
which
has
a
discriminatory
effect
on
a
protected
group,
the
foreign
born
because
the
foreign
born
are
a
protected
group
in
terms
of
national
origin
discrimination.
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment.
mr.
george
cooper
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
and
now
this
is
an
appeal
from
that
reversal.
so,
if
this
court
reverses
--
if
this
court
affirms
the
fifth
circuit,
the
case
goes
back
down
to
the
district
court
with
the
summary
judgment
denied
in
effect.
mr.
george
cooper
we
had
won
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
--
mr.
george
cooper
if
the
court
rules
force
in
the
title
vii
ground
or
in
the
1981
ground.
mr.
george
cooper
if
it
rules
against
us,
there’s
still
an
argument
to
be
made
on
the
merits
in
the
district
court.
an
argument
that
in
this
particular
case,
farah’s
citizen
–-
mr.
george
cooper
that
farrah’s
citizenship
requirement
is
abiding
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
and
there’s
also
the
possibility
it
was
raising
in
1981
argument
if
the
court
chooses
not
to
reach
it.
mr.
george
cooper
well,
your
honor,
it’s
variation.
it’s
a
variation
on
the
same
thing
and
i
think
the
court
could
reach
it
if
it
wanted,
but
certainly,
the
court
would
have
good
grounds
not
to
reach
it
if
it
doesn’t
want
at
this
time.
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
there’s
ample
reason
not
to
reach
it
if
the
court
chooses
not
to
reach
it.
mr.
george
cooper
oh,
no.
i
don’t
see
it
as
precluded
in
jurisdictional
terms.
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
george
cooper
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cooper
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
me
today
is
my
co-counsel
in
this
case,
mr.
ruben
montemayor
of
san
antonio,
texas.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
mrs.
espinoza,
is
a
lawfully
admitted,
permanent
resident
alien
of
the
united
states.
she
is
married
to
an
american
citizen
and
has
two
children
who
are
american
citizens.
she
applied
for
a
job
and
was
denied
the
job
solely
because
she,
herself
is
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
an
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
this
form
of
exclusion
or
discrimination
against
mrs.
espinoza
is
prohibited
by
federal
civil
rights
act.
the
primary
construction
--
the
primary
construction
to
be
made
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
origin
discrimination
prohibition
in
title
vii
applies
to
bar
this
form
of
exclusion.
in
beginning
the
argument,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
clarify
exactly
what
our
position
is
and
remove
some
distractions
from
the
case.
first
of
all,
it
should
be
clear
that
there
is
no
question
whatever
that
aliens,
as
persons
or
individuals,
are
in
fact
protected
by
title
vii.
the
scope
of
title
vii
is
not
limited
to
citizens
that
includes
aliens,
non-citizens
as
well.
the
only
question
is,
what
they
are
protected
against.
second,
your
honors,
and
this
is
most
important
because
it’s
an
element
of
confusion
in
the
case
for
many
persons,
myself
for
a
long
time
included.
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
in
ruling
in
our
favor
on
the
title
vii
argument.
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
find
that
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
citizenship
or
nationality
is
in
its
own
terms
prohibited
by
title
vii.
our
basic
position
is
that
citizenship
discrimination
is
prohibited.
our
basic
position
is
that
title
vii
bars
national
origin
discrimination
and
that
phrase
should
be
interpreted
to
cover
any
non-merit
related
discrimination
on
any
ground
which
relates
to
national
origin
and
nationality
so
relates.
nationality
is
non-related
to
merit
in
performing
a
job.
it
is
related
to
national
origin
and
therefore
discrimination
on
grounds
of
nationality
should
be
interpreted
as
covered
by
title
vii.
but,
we
do
not
press,
your
honors,
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
it
is
not
necessary
because
whether
or
not,
title
vii
--
the
national
origin
phrase
in
title
vii,
whether
or
not
that
is
interpreted
to
include
nationality,
it
should
be
clear
that
the
citizenship
requirement
of
farah
is
a
requirement
which
has
a
discriminatory
impact
in
terms
of
national
origin.
the
citizenship
requirement
is
like
the
test
or
a
high
school
diploma
requirement
that
was
before
this
court
in
griggs
against
duke
power
company.
it
is
standard
which
although
it
may
be
neutral
on
its
face,
it’s
a
standard
which
has
a
definite
and
decided
adverse
impact
in
national
origin
terms
and
that
impact
alone
is
ample
to
cause
the
citizenship
standard
to
be
declared
unlawful.
there
are
two
ways
in
which
the
citizenship
requirement
has
this
adverse
effect
in
national
origin
terms.
first,
it
has
an
adverse
impact
directly
related
to
a
person’s
place
of
birth.
one
aspect
of
national
origin,
taking
the
term
national
origin
simply
and
literally,
one
aspect
of
someone’s
national
origin
is
where
they
themselves
originate
--
where
they
themselves
are
born.
the
respondents
apparently
would
deny
or
ignore
that
fact
and
say
that
national
origin
means
ethnic
origin.
but
the
statute
doesn’t
say
that.
the
statute
doesn’t
say
ethnic
origins.
there’s
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
that
says
ethnic
origins.
the
statute
says
national
origins
and
there
are
various
aspects
of
national
origin.
one
aspect
of
a
person’s
national
origin
is
where
his
ancestors,
his
forbearers
come
from,
his
ethnic
origins.
but
another
aspect
of
an
individual’s
national
origin
is
where
he
himself
comes
from.
and
if
an
employer
discriminates
against
an
individual
because
of
his
birthplace,
he
is
discriminating
in
national
origin
terms
and
his
act
should
be
prohibited
by
the
statute.
now,
farah
manufacturing
company
has
not
gone
so
far
as
to
openly
and
clearly
discriminating
terms
of
place
of
birth.
we
admit
that.
they
don’t
say,
“we
hire
only
people
born
in
the
united
states
and
no
one
born
abroad.”
if
they
had
said
that,
i
think
it
would
be
--
the
case
would
be
easy.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your--
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
most
of
the
farah
employees
are
born
in
this
country.
they
do
have
some--
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
they
have
a
--
most
of
the
farah
employees
are
born
in
this
country
but
they
don’t
restrict
their
employment
to
only
persons
born
in
this
country.
they
restrict
the
employment
to
citizens
and
of
course,
some
citizens
are
persons
who
were
born
abroad,
but
that
doesn’t
alter
the
fact
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
a
requirement
which
has
a
definite,
clear
mark
decided,
adverse
impact
in
terms
of
a
person’s
place
of
birth.
if
you
are
born
in
one
place,
the
united
states,
the
citizenship
requirement
is
essentially
meaningless
to
you.
your
citizenship
has
been
handed
to
you
by
virtue
of
your
birth.
but
if
you
were
born
any
other
place,
but
in
the
united
states,
you
must
undergo
a
serious
and
restrictive
and
difficult
process
to
gain
citizenship,
the
process
of
naturalization.
and
any
standard
which
imposes
a
harsher,
more
difficult
burden
on
persons
because
of
their
place
of
birth
is
a
standard
which
has
a
discriminatory
impact
in
terms
of
the
individual’s
national
origin.
mr.
george
cooper
persons
born
in
texas,
your
honor?
mr.
george
cooper
well,
that
would
not
relate
--
that
would
not
relate
to
national
origin
in
terms
of
the
way
it
excluded
other
people
from
other
parts
of
the
united
states
but
it
would
relate
to
national
origin
in
terms
of
discriminating
against
persons
of
foreign
birth
and
we
would
have
to
assess
the
national
origin
impact
of
that.
is
the
impact
of
a
texas
restriction,
a
restriction
which
has
a
harsher
effect
on
a
foreign
born
than
the
american
born.
that
would
be
a
question
which
we
have
to
pursue.
i’m
not
sure
what
the
facts
would
show.
but
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
a
requirement
which
imposes
a
very
differential
burden
on
the
american
born
as
compared
to
the
foreign
born.
it’s
just
like
the
test
in
the
griggs
case.
the
test
was
one
which
was
given
to
whites
and
blacks.
it
didn’t
exclude
all
blacks
just
like
the
citizenship
requirement,
it
doesn’t
exclude
all
foreign
born
persons,
but
the
test
was
one
which
the
blacks
had
a
more
difficult
time
passing.
the
test
was
something
which
operated
as
a
built-in
headwind
against
the
blacks
and
it’s
that
built-in
headwind
making
it
more
difficult
for
blacks
in
practice
than
whites
to
get
jobs
which
caused
the
test
to
be
declared
unlawful
in
griggs
and
so
to
the
citizenship
requirement
which
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
foreign
born
to
get
a
job
than
for
the
native
born
to
get
a
job.
it’s
a
discrimination.
it’s
a
standard
which
has
a
discriminatory
impact
in
national
origin
terms
to
the
extent
that
national
origin
relates
to
an
individual’s
birthplace.
we
think
that
point
is
simple
and
clear
and
that
alone
is
a
sufficient
ground
to
sustain
us,
your
honor.
but,
if
there
are
no
questions
on
that
point,
let
me
go
on
to
our
second
point.
that
is
that
even
if
the
court
wishes
to
ignore
this
discrimination
in
terms
of
place
of
birth
which
is
the
effect
of
the
citizenship
rule.
if
the
court
wants
instead
merely
to
look
at
ethnic
discrimination,
which
is
what
the
respondents
urge,
nonetheless,
the
citizenship
requirement
has
a
discriminatory
impact,
a
discriminatory
effect
in
terms
of
an
individual’s
ethnic
background.
the
citizenship
requirement
does
not
in
practice
and
effect
apply
to
all
ethnic
groups
equally.
rather,
it
imposes
a
harsher
burden
on
some
ethnic
groups
than
on
other
ethnic
groups
which
proves--
mr.
george
cooper
your
honor,
the
ethnic
group
changes
from
time
to
time.
the
ethnic
group
which
is
most
harshly
affected
by
a
citizenship
requirement
is
the
ethnic
group
at
a
particular
time
and
place
which
is
most
heavily
made
up
of
recent
immigrants.
in
boston
in
1850,
the
ethnic
group--
mr.
george
cooper
now
and--
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cooper
your
honor,
in
terms--
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
the
two
separate
ethnic
groups
if
we’re
talking
in
ethnic
terms,
without
regard
the
birthplace.
the
different
ethnic
groups
are
mexican
on
the
one
hand,
polish
on
the
other
hand,
italian
on
the
other
hand--
those
ethnic.
now,
when
i’m
talking
ethnic
groups,
i’m
talking
in
those
terms
now.
if
one
wants
to
look
at
that
aspect
of
national
origin,
and
again,
remember
that
that’s
only
one
aspect
of
national
origin.
our
basic
position
is
that
there’s
more
than
one
aspect
and
birthplace
is
a
separate
independent
aspect.
but
we
will
look
at
ethnic
background,
that
aspect
of
national
origin.
the
citizenship
requirement
in
texas
right
now,
primarily
hurts
mexicans.
in
san
francisco,
it
primarily
hurts
orientals
and
mexicans.
in
boston
in
1850,
it
would’ve
primarily
hurt
the
irish.
in
each
cases,
citizenship--
mr.
george
cooper
because
mexicans
--
because
the
ethnic
group
which
is
most
heavily
represented
in
the
non-citizen
category
--
the
ethnic
group
which
is
most
heavily
made
up
of
recent
immigrants.
in
texas
right
now,
it's
mexicans,
80%
of
the
alien
residents
in
san
antonio,
70%
to
80%
are
mexicans.
so,
to
impose
an
anti-alien
rule,
the
primary
people
you
hurt
are
the
mexicans
and
that
will
always
be
the
case.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
you
only
hurt
the
mexicans
who
aren’t
naturalized.
that’s
right.
in
each
case,
you
only
hurt
the
people
who
are
naturalized
but
what’s
the
effect
of
the
rule?
in
the
griggs
case,
the
only
people
you
hurt
were
the
blacks
that
couldn’t
pass
the
test
but
that
wasn’t
the
way
the
court
looked
at
it.
the
court
said,
to
the
extent--
mr.
george
cooper
well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
reasons
why
people
aren’t
naturalized.
one
is
because
they
don’t
bother
to
do
it.
the
other
is
because
they
can’t
do
it
and
there
are
many
reasons
why
you
can’t
do
it
starting
from
the
fact
that
you
may
not
have
lived
in
the
county
long
enough.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
she
doesn’t
speak
english.
and
one
of
the
requirements
--
one
of
the
requirements
for
naturalization
is
--
mr.
george
cooper
yes.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
and
she
has
not
yet
learned
english.
the
record
indicates
that
she’s
in
the
process
of
trying
to
learn
english.
she’s
in
the
process
of
pursuing
citizenship
but
she
has
not
acquired
the
ability
to
pursue
citizenship.
but
she’s
not
the
only
person
who
can’t
speak
english.
there
are
many
people
who
are
us
citizens
who
can’t
speak
english.
the
us
citizens
from
puerto
rico,
most
of
them
or
many
of
them
can’t
speak
english.
the
mere
fact
that
you
can’t
speak
english
doesn’t
necessarily
preclude
you
from
being
a
citizen
unless
you
were
born
abroad.
and
it
certainly
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
this
job
here.
the
important
fact
is
that--
mr.
george
cooper
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
this
--
no,
it
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
this
job
and
that’s
--
and
that’s
of
course
crucial
to
the
extent
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
unlawful
because
of
its
discriminatory
impact
--
discriminatory
effects.
we
don’t
say
that
it’s
per
se
unlawful.
we
say
rather
that
it’s
unlawful
unless
the
particular
employer
can
show
some
job
relatedness
to
it
and
in
this
case,
there’s
not
a
slightest
suggestion
that
being
a
citizen
or
speaking
english
or
being
anything
else
with
regard
to
citizenship
has
anything
to
do
with
the
job
which
is
running
a
sewing
machine
in
a
pants
factory.
in
terms
of
ethnic
discrimination,
again,
the
point
is,
your
honors,
that
in
each
case,
the
effect
of
a
citizenship
requirement
will
be
to
discriminate
against
the
particular
group
which
predominates
in
the
alien
population
at
the
time
and
that
is
the
group
which
at
the
time
is
most
vulnerable
to
national
origin
discrimination.
the
use
of
a
citizenship
requirement
mirrors
the
national
origin
discrimination
in
the
country
at
the
particular
time.
and
because
of
that
--
because
the
effect
of
the
citizenship
requirement,
is
to
single
out
and
have
primary
impact
on
the
particular
group
which
is
primarily
recent
immigrants
at
a
particular
time.
the
effect
of
it
is
to
impose
a
disproportionate
burden
on
certain
ethnic
groups
--
the
most
vulnerable
ethnic
group
at
the
time
and
place.
and
that
impact
also
makes
--
also
causes
national
origin
discrimination.
now
your
honors,
in
response
to
these
two
arguments
on
our
part,
the
arguments
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
a
test,
a
standard
which
has
discriminatory
effects
in
terms
of
place
of
birth.
it
singles
out
american
born
people
and
favors
them
as
compared
to
foreign
born
people
or
the
fact
that
it
singles
out
long-time
established
ethnic
groups
and
prefers
them
to
recent
immigrant
ethnic
groups.
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
being
able
to
become
a
permanent
resident
alien,
there
are
various
ways
in
which
you
can
do
that.
the
way
in
which--
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
she
has
to
go
--
she
has
to
meet
the
same
requirements
for
citizenship.
mr.
george
cooper
it
ignored
the--
mr.
george
cooper
there
may
be
some
modifications
in
the
process
because
of
the
fact
that
she
acquired
her
permanent
resident
status
through
her
marriage
with
an
american
citizen,
but
she
is
not
exempted
from
the
learning
of
history
requirements,
from
the
english
language
requirements
and
those
requirements
of
citizenship.
the
only
response
which
the
respondent
has
to
our
claims
that
the
citizenship
requirement
is
a
standard
which
has
adverse
special
extra
effects
on
people
born
abroad,
special
burdens
on
the
foreign
born
or
on
certain
ethnic
groups,
the
recent
immigrant
ethnic
groups.
the
only
response
they
have
to
that
is
to
say,
“well,
that
may
be
true
that
that
form
of
discrimination
is
unlawful
in
some
cases”
that
discriminatory
effect,
but
it’s
not
unlawful
in
our
case
because
we
hire
a
lot
of
mexicans.
we
hire
a
lot
of
mexicans
who
are
citizens.
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
answer
is
inadequate.
first
of
all,
to
the
extent
that
the
unlawful
aspect
of
the
discrimination
is
its
special
burden
on
the
foreign
born,
its
differential
treatment
of
the
foreign
born
as
compared
to
the
american
born.
the
hiring
of
mexicans
who
are
american
born
is
no
defense
at
all.
it’s
essentially
an
irrelevant
answer.
now,
if
we
turn
to
the
second
way
of
looking
at
this
case,
analyzing
in
terms
of
the
ethnic
effect
rather
than
the
birthplace
effect,
it’s
also
not
a
sufficient
answer
to
say,
“we
hire
a
lot
of
mexicans”
because
the
respondent
has
not
established,
first
of
all,
that
his
hiring
of
a
lot
of
mexicans
means
that
he
hires
other
ethnic
groups
which
may
be
adversely
affected
by
the
citizenship
requirement.
second,
it
says
nothing
about
whether
or
not
at
least
one
more
person
of
mexican
background
might
not
have
been
hired
had
he
not
imposed
the
citizenship
requirement.
and
that’s
all
it
takes,
your
honors.
all
it
takes
is
the
possibility
that
one
more
mexican
might
have
been
hired.
that’s
all
it
takes
to
justify
holding
the
standard
unlawful
because
we
are
not
here
talking
about
any
kind
of
standards
which
has
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
job-relatedness,
merit
or
ability.
we’re
talking
about
a
wholly
arbitrary
standard
which
the
employer
has
not
attempted
to
justify
at
all,
and
even
at
the
minimized
discriminatory
effect
should
be
enough
to
declare
that
kind
of
requirement
unlawful.
so,
for
those
two
reasons,
the
discriminatory
effect,
the
special
burden
which
just
imposes
on
a
foreign
born
and
also
because
of
the
discriminatory
effect
and
special
burden
that
this
imposes
on
recent
immigrant
groups,
not
that
the
citizenship
requirement
should
be
declared
unlawful
under
the
general
standard
of
the
griggs
against
duke
power
company
case
that
any
special
requirement
or
hurdle
which
is
non-job
related.
this
certainly
declared
--
mr.
george
cooper
the
first
one
clearly
is.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
second
one
is
not
present
to
an
obvious
extent.
it
may
be
present.
we
don’t
know
how
many
mexicans.
we
do
know
that
the
company
employs
more
than
90%
mexicans.
mr.
george
cooper
as
it
varies
from
plan
to
plan.
we
do
know
that
but
we
don’t
know
whether
or
not
there
might
have
been
one
more
mexican
without
this
discriminatory
effect.
the
same
kind
of
argument
--
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
the
respondent
has
claimed
that,
but
there
is
in
fact
nothing
--
no
credible
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
--
mr.
george
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
the
probabilities
are
clearly
true.
but,
the
same
kind
of
issue
was
presented
to
this
case,
in
this
court
in
the
phillips
versus
martin
marietta
case,
the
case
involving
sex
discrimination
against
women
with
small
children.
the
employer
in
that
case
said
that
--
well,
he
admitted
that
his
requirement
had
a
discriminatory
effect
on
women
but
he
then
went
on
to
point
that
he
hired
70
to
80%
women.
mr.
george
cooper
and
therefore
--
he
more
then
made
up
for
whatever
discriminatory
effect
he
might
have
caused.
and
the
court
essentially
ignored
that
argument
and
properly
so,
because
it’s
not
--
what
i
might
call
the
code
of
defense
argument.
i
can
discriminate
so
long
as
i
make
up
for
it
with
some
other
positive
discrimination.
that’s
an
argument
which
seems
to
us
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
basic
purpose
of
title
vii
to
bring
about
the
hiring
of
individuals
on
the
basis
of
their
own
merit
and
not
on
the
basis
of
codes.
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
correctly
points
out
--
to
the
extent,
we’re
talking
about
the
first
effect,
the
effect
in
terms
of
birthplace,
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
hiring
of
mexican
citizens
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
and
indeed,
most
of
the
mexicans
hired
are
native-born
mexicans.
we
look
in
terms
of
birthplace.
there
are
very
few
naturalized
mexicans
in
san
antonio.
mr.
george
cooper
pardon.
mr.
george
cooper
the
percentage
of
naturalized
mexicans
as
compared
to
native
born
mexicans
in
san
antonio,
there’s
no
doubt
in
the
record
on
that,
your
honor.
the
census
figures
--
mr.
george
cooper
the
data
on
the
percentage
of
naturalized
citizens
--
the
data
on
the
percentage
of
mexicans
and
so
on
is
not
in
the
records
derived
from
the
census
department
figures.
mr.
george
cooper
that’s
right.
mr.
george
cooper
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cooper
no.
i’m
not--i’m
not--
mr.
george
cooper
no.
the
only
point
i
was
making
was
that
to
the
extent
that
farah
employs
mexicans.
most
of
the
people
who
it
employs
are
probably
native-born
mexicans
rather
than
naturalized
mexicans.
mr.
george
cooper
mexicans
who
were
--
he
hires
only
--
mr.
george
cooper
excuse
me.
no,
okay.
sorry,
i
should
have
stated
it
differently.
he
hires
primarily
mexicans
who
are
native
born
in
the
united
states,
persons
of
mexican
background
who
were
born
in
the
united
states.
there’s
nothing
on
the
record
on
that.
mr.
george
cooper
the
census
figures
indicated
only
something
like
30,000
out
of
almost
400,000
mexicans
in
san
antonio
are
foreign
born.
and,
that’s
our
basic
title
vii
case,
your
honors.
we
also
make
an
argument
under
section
1981
of
1442
usc
and
there
of
course,
the
argument
is
much
more
straightforward.
section
1981
clearly
prohibits
discrimination
against
aliens
as
compared
to
citizens.
the
language
in
the
statute
is
very
clear.
and
as
that
argument
prepared
in
the
rest
in
our
brief,
just
make
one
point
to
the
court
--
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
that’s
the
point
i
was
about
to
make.
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
discussed
or
argued
in
the
lower
courts
as
such.
they
were
referenced
to
jones
against
meyer,
references
to
things
mentioning
the
statute
but
the
argument
was
not
presented
as
such
and
it’s
relevant
to
this
case
--
only
relevant
to
this
case
in
three
different
ways.
one,
it
certainly
bears
upon
the
general
statutory
provisions
with
regard
the
protection
of
aliens,
and
to
that
extent,
relevant
to
the
construction
of
title
vii.
that’s
its
primary
purpose
here.
secondly,
it
does
provide
an
alternative
basis
for
this
court’s
decision
if
this
court
should
wish
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
case
from
section
1981.
and
thirdly,
and
i
express
this
only
as
a
caution
on
our
part,
if
in
fact
the
court
decides
against
this
on
the
title
vii
ground
and
does
not
want
to
reach
the
1981
issue,
we
just
ask
that
the
court
not
take
any
action
which
will
preclude
us
for
raising
the
issue
in
the
case
on
remand
because
the
case
is
here
now
only
on
a
denial
motion
and
for
summary
judgment,
and
on
remand,
the
case
will
still
be
alive
for
further
action.
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
we
admit
that
she
was
discriminated
against
because
of
her
non-citizen
status.
that’s
a
pro-citizen
discrimination.
our
basic
point
is
that
nonetheless,
since
the
effect
of
discriminating
against
people
because
of
lack
of
citizenship
is
to
impose
a
special
burden
and
to
make
it,
to
lay
down
a
built-in
headwind
for
foreign
born
people.
the
citizenship
requirement
is
unlawful.
the
statute
in
griggs
--
the
statute
didn’t
prohibit
test
requirements.
the
individual
in
griggs
was
denied
a
job
because
he
failed
a
test
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
you
can't
deny
a
person
a
job
because
they
failed
the
test
if
the
test
is
one
which
has
a
discriminatory
impact
on
protected
groups.
and
so
to
hear,
mrs.
espinoza’s
denied
a
job
because
of
her
lack
of
citizenship.
her
lack
of
citizenship
is
a
neutral
requirement
but
it’s
a
requirement
which
has
a
discriminatory
effect
on
a
protected
group,
the
foreign
born
because
the
foreign
born
are
a
protected
group
in
terms
of
national
origin
discrimination.
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment.
mr.
george
cooper
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
and
now
this
is
an
appeal
from
that
reversal.
so,
if
this
court
reverses
--
if
this
court
affirms
the
fifth
circuit,
the
case
goes
back
down
to
the
district
court
with
the
summary
judgment
denied
in
effect.
mr.
george
cooper
we
had
won
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
--
mr.
george
cooper
if
the
court
rules
force
in
the
title
vii
ground
or
in
the
1981
ground.
mr.
george
cooper
if
it
rules
against
us,
there’s
still
an
argument
to
be
made
on
the
merits
in
the
district
court.
an
argument
that
in
this
particular
case,
farah’s
citizen
–-
mr.
george
cooper
that
farrah’s
citizenship
requirement
is
abiding
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
and
there’s
also
the
possibility
it
was
raising
in
1981
argument
if
the
court
chooses
not
to
reach
it.
mr.
george
cooper
well,
your
honor,
it’s
variation.
it’s
a
variation
on
the
same
thing
and
i
think
the
court
could
reach
it
if
it
wanted,
but
certainly,
the
court
would
have
good
grounds
not
to
reach
it
if
it
doesn’t
want
at
this
time.
mr.
george
cooper
no,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
there’s
ample
reason
not
to
reach
it
if
the
court
chooses
not
to
reach
it.
mr.
george
cooper
oh,
no.
i
don’t
see
it
as
precluded
in
jurisdictional
terms.
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
george
cooper
thank
you,
your
honor.
