mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
reading
counsel’s
description
in
this
--
particularly
in
this
brief
of
the
plight
of
the
american
immigrant
in
the
1880’s
and
up
to
as
recently
as
45
or
50
years
ago
i
was
reminded
of
the
remarks
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
sand
door
case
with
the
carpenters
local
1976.
speaking
of
the
secondary
boycott
problems
in
that
case,
it
said
that
these
afford
a
striking
illustration.
the
importance
of
this
is
that
it
is
the
business
of
congress
to
declare
a
policy
and
not
this
courts.
the
judicial
function
is
confined
to
applying
what
congress
has
enacted
after
ascertaining
what
it
is
that
congress
has
enacted.
we’re
presented
here
with
a
simple
and
narrow
question
of
statutory
construction.
that
is
in
1964,
did
--
not
should
but
did
congress
intend
to
hold
an
employer’s
policy
of
hiring
only
united
states
citizens
where
all
parties
acknowledged
that
that
policy
has
been
applied
in
a
non-discriminatory
manner.
we
think
that
the
history
of
the
act
clearly
demonstrates
that
congress
had
no
such
intention.
before
discussing
the
factors
before
the
united
states
congress
and
suggest
--
note
that
there’s
been
only
one
case
other
than
the
district
court
in
this
case
which
has
applied
national
origin
in
a
way
that
petitioner’s
briefs
suggest
that
it
should
be
applied.
and
that
case
is
cited
in
petitioner’s
brief
as
london
board
of--
london
borough
of
ealing
versus
race
relations
board,and
there,
the
queen’s
best
division
applied
precisely,
the
statutory
construction
to
a
national
origin
statute
in
great
britain
that
the
petitioner
seeks
here.
that
decision
was
reversed
by
the
house
of
lords
in
1972.
and
aside
from
that
one
decision,
nobody
has
yet
agreed
with
counsel,
aside
from
that
one
in
the
district
court
here.
now,
what
was
before
the
congress
in
1964?
i’d
suggest
that
the
first
and
most
obvious
factor
before
the
court
was
that
of
the
employment
practices
of
the
federal
government
itself.
from
1914,
for
50
years,
eight
or
nine
consecutive
presidents
beginning
with
president
wilson
had
required
by
executive
order
that
in
order
to
sit
for
civil
service
examination,
an
individual
must
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
now,
at
various
times,
there
were
certainly
very
limited
exceptions
which
i
regard
as
totally
irrelevant
to
the
basic
issue
here.
for
the
last
21
of
those
years,
beginning
in
1943
and
under
president
roosevelt,
trumann,
eisenhower
and
kennedy,
the
same
presidents
who
re-affirmed
the
necessity
that
civil
service
applicant
must
be
a
citizen
by
executive
order
also
for
bad
discrimination
based
upon
among
other
things,
national
origin.
now
obviously,
for
21
years,
no
one
had
raised
the
contention
and
no
one
had
suggested
to
the
congress
that
these
two
policies
could
not
co-exist
side
by
side.
this
has
been
raised
in
one
case
that
i’m
aware
of
since
1964
in
mow
sun
wong
versus
hampton
in
the
northern
district
of
california
in
1971
where
a
group
of
chinese
aliens,
again,
under
statutory
construction
case,
sued
the
chairman
of
the
civil
service
commission
when
they
were
denied
the
right
to
sit
for
civil
service
examination
and
they
alleged
that
the
civil
service
rule
was
in
violation
of
what
by
then
was
statutory
federal
government
policy
of
not
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
national
origin
and
the
judge
there
said
that
there
was
no
problem
that
the
two
statutes
or
the
two
policies
could
easily
co-exist.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
it’s
the
only
case,
i’m
aware
of.
yes,
your
honor.
the
next
area
that
was
before
the
congress
when
it
was
enacting
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
was
the
fact
that
according
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
some
28
states
had
enacted
fair
employment
practices
legislation
at
the
time
that
civil
rights
act
of
1964
was
passed.
the
various
fair
employment
practices
commissions
of
those
states
in
19
--
pardon
me.
one
of
the
factors
virtually
all
of
these
28
for
bad
discrimination
based
early
on
national
origin
and/or
national
ancestry.
19
of
these
state
fair
employment
practices
commissions
had
discussed
and
considered
the
question
of
whether
under
their
policy,
an
employer
could
still
require
citizenship.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
at
recess,
we
were
examining
some
of
the
factors
that
the
congress
had
before
at
the
time
it
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
we’d
looked
at
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
operating
under
the
same
prohibitory
languages
as
is
contained
in
title
vii
of
civil
rights
act,
so
no
inconsistency
for
21
years
in
applying
the
same
policy
that
farah
applies.
then
we
were
in
process
of
looking
at
the
fact
that
some
19
state
fair
employment
practice
commissions
as
of
1964
had
addressed
themselves
to
the
question
of
whether
they
under
their
own
fep
legislation
barring
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
national
origin
or
national
ancestry,
an
employer
could
nevertheless
require
that
his
employees
be
citizens
and
of
those
19
states,
18
had
found
no
inconsistency
in
the
policy.
then
we
turn
if
we
may
to
the
debate
surrounding
the
1964
act
itself,
and
of
course,
the
very
first
thing
we’re
faced
with
is
the
remark
of
congressman
roosevelt
who
is
chairman
of
the
house
subcommittee
which
reported
out
what
became
the
civil
rights
act
and
in
the
course
of
being
questioned
on
the
floor
of
the
house
with
regard
to
what
national
origin
meant,
he
said,
“i
just
made
very
clear
that
national
origin
means
national.
it
means
the
country
from
you
and
your
fore
bearers
came
from.
you
may
come
from
poland,
czechoslovakia,
england,
france
or
any
other
country.”
and
with
that,
the
subject
was
dropped.
now,
in
his
brief,
mr.
cooper
points
out
that
this
is
isolated,
that
there’s
only
one
such
illustration
in
the
debate
and
i
might
suggest
there
that
the
reason
is
because
the
reason
was
so
obvious
that
once
answered
in
the
normal
understanding
of
the
word,
there
was
no
further
necessity
for
expanding
them.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
because
your
honor,
they
hold
that
the
national
origin
prohibition
in
the
act
means
that
it’s
unlawful
for
farah
in
the
facts
of
this
case
to
discriminate
against
people
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
they
or
their
ancestors
came
from
mexico.
the
facts
in
this
case
clearly
show
that
there
has
been
no
such
discrimination.
rather
the
discrimination,
and
it
exists,
there
is
discrimination,
no
question,
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
person
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
now,
under
congressman
roosevelt’s
language,
if
farah
had
a
policy
of
hiring
nationals
from
poland,
from
czechoslovakia,
from
england
and
france,
but
not
nationals
of
mexico,
then
there
would
be
discrimination
on
the
national
origin
of
the
individual
and
it
would
clearly
be
prohibited.
but
everybody
acknowledges
and
all
the
facts
stand
clear
that
that’s
not
farah’s
policy.
the
only
other
reference
to
somewhere
to
this
that
we
were
able
to
find
was
in
the
debates
or
the
hearings
before
congressman
roosevelt’s
committee
where
then
secretary
of
labor,
willard
wirtz
was
described
in
the
federal
policy
of
complaint
processing
on
the
grounds
of
employment
discrimination
within
the
government.
and
secretary
wirtz’s
attention
obviously
was
primarily
with
regard
to
racial
discrimination,
but
then
he
turned
to
national
origin
and
religious
discrimination
and
he
said,
“for
example,
if
a
person
feels
that
he’s
been
disadvantaged
because
he
is
of
mexican,
italian
or
polish
origin,
then
he
files
a
complaint
with
the
commission
and
proceeds.”
now,
obviously,
it
was
implicit
in
what
secretary
wirtz
was
saying
that
every
single
one
of
those
people
were
united
states
citizens.
they
wouldn’t
even
been
employees
of
the
federal
government
if
they
weren’t.
section
701
(b),
which
has
now
been
--
of
title
vii
which
is
now
recodified
into
5
u.s.c.
7151,
declares
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
not
to
discriminate
on
the
grounds
of
national
origin
and
yet,
no
one
understood
that
this
was
changing
the
federal
policy.
it
was
only
making
statutory
what’s
theretofore
been
the
rule
by
executive
order
and
everyone
understood
that
the
federal
government
was
still
going
to
limit
its
employment
practices
--
employment
hiring
to
united
states
citizens.
and
indeed,
i’ll
direct
your
attention
if
i
might,
to
the
brief
filed
herein
on
the
motion
for
a
certiorari
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
where
he
says
that
the
us
agrees
with
the
fifth
circuit’s
interpretation
that
congress
construed
the
phrase
to
mean
ancestry
rather
than
citizenship,
and
then
he
makes
the
obvious
point
in
a
footnote
that
surely
congress
intended
that
the
same
meaning
be
applied
to
section
701
(b)
of
title
vii
as
it
applied
in
section
703
(a).
the
words
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
that’s
right
but
the
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
well,
right
and
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
it
is.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
depending
on
the
circumstances,
i
think
it’s
three
to
five
years.
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
that’s
correct
and
i’d
say
frankly,
your
honor,
that
if
more
companies
had
the
policy
that
farah
has,
congress
would
probably
see
fit
to
change
the
law.
what
we’re
suggesting
is
that
so
far,
they
haven’t.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
precisely.
and
i
think
that’s
the
only
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
no
sir,
i
don’t
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
a
few
but
not
major
ones,
your
honor.
1981
of
course,
as
i
think,
for
the
reasons
that
both
justice
blackmun
and
justice
marshall
pointed
out
yesterday,
is
not
before
us.
but
even
if
it
were,
the
courts
that
have
faced
the
question
with
that
one
single
exception
have
held
at
section
1981
does
not
apply
to
national
origin
discrimination.
they
do
so
primarily
on
the
basis
that
mr.
justice
stewart’s
decision
in
jones
versus
meyer
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
correct.
either
way,
if
they
used
the
thirteenth
by
the
terms
it
applies
only
to
racial
discrimination.
if
they
used
the
fourteenth,
then
it
applies
to
state
action.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
we’re
not
suggesting
here,
your
honor,
that
the
congress
could
not
outlaw
or
prohibit
farah’s
policy
under
the
immigration
policy.
it
could.
we
only
suggest
that
so
far,
it
hadn’t.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
well,
your
honor,
it’s
clear
that
congress
understood
that
it
was
acting
pursuant
to
one.
i
think
that
sheds
real
light
on
the
congressional
understanding
of
what
they
are
purporting
to
do.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
i
don’t
need
to
bother
the
court
really
with
it.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
the
cases
that
have
held
that
1981
does
not
apply
to
a
racial
discrimination,
it’s
interesting
that
the
only
case
and
it’s
cited
in
mr.
cooper’s
brief
that
holds
to
the
contrary
is
guerra
versus
manchester
terminal
which
is
now
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit,
and
i
think
it
will
be
reversed.
but
even
guerra
recognizes
that
the
act
was
found
--
that
section
1981
was
founded
on
the
thirteenth
amendment.
i
think
for
that
reason,
guerra
is
clearly
wrong
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
will
reverse
it.
to
expand
a
little
further
on
the
suggestion
of
what
the
view
of
the
united
states.
it’s
been
the
policy
for
a
number
of
years
of
the
united
states
to
put
in
various
appropriations
acts
that
no
money
expended
under
this
or
any
other
appropriation
act
in
this
fiscal
year
will
be
used
to
a
certain,
again,
limited
exceptions
to
pay
aliens.
now,
to
give
the
reading
to
title
vii
that
mr.
cooper
and
petitioner
ask,
you’d
have
to
assume
that
in
1964,
congress
on
the
one
hand
said,
“from
now
on,
the
federal
government’s
going
to
hire
aliens,
but
we’re
just
not
going
to
pay
them.”
obviously,
that
was
not
the
congressional
intent.
now,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
for
a
second
to
the
question
of
the
eeoc
regulations.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
your
honor
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
your
honor,
there
is
in
the
record,
the
recognition
that
one
time,
farah
deviated
from
that
policy.
now,
it’s
not
in
the
record
and
i
apologize
both
to
counsel
and
the
court,
i
represented
the
facts
in
my
brief
and
they
are
correct,
but
they’re
not
contained
in
the
record
now.
that’s
because
we
weren’t
asked
on
an
interrogatory,
it
would’ve
come
out,
but
there’s
been
one
single
exception
in
the
history
of
the
company,
your
honor.
while
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
griggs
pointed
out
that
eeoc
guidelines
are
entitled
to
great
difference
and
we
don’t
quarrel
for
that
--
with
that
for
a
moment.
he
then
said
that
the
reason
they
do
is
that
since
the
act
in
its
legislative
history
support
the
commission’s
conclusion,
this
affords
good
reason
to
treat
the
guidelines
as
expressed
in
the
will
of
congress.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
analogous
to
a
fair
labor
standards
act
situation
where
this
court
in
skidmore
versus
swift
and
consistently
since
has
said
that
interpretative
bulletins
of
the
secretary
of
labor
and
wage
hour
cases
are
entitled
to
great
weight.
but
in
skidmore
versus
swift
itself,
the
court
held
that
the
reason
they
are
is
because
of
the
weight
of
such
judgment,
in
a
particular
case,
it
said
will
depend
on
the
thoroughness
evident
in
its
consideration
upon
the
validity
of
its
reasoning
and
all
those
other
factors
which
give
these
interpretative
bulletins
the
power
to
persuade,
if
not
the
power
to
control.
and
the
courts
while
giving
tremendous
deference
and
have
[laughter
attempt]
been
on
the
losing
side
of
one
or
two
to
interpretative
bulletins
of
the
secretary
of
labor,
they
don’t
hesitate
to
overrule
them
where
they’re
wrong.
now,
we
think
that
that’s
precisely
what
the
court
should
do
in
griggs,
i’m
sorry
in
farah.
in
support
of
that,
we’d
show
you
what
we
regard
as
the
fatal
flaw
in
the
eeoc’s
reasoning
and
again,
direct
you
attention
to
the
memorandum
on
the
question
of
whether
certiorari
should
be
granted.
the
solicitor
general
pointed
to
the
record
of
farah
in
employing
people
of
mexican
origin.
and
the
fact
that
over
90%
of
our
employees
have
such
origin
and
the
he
referred
this
to
the
atypical
factual
situation
presented
here
which
makes
this
a
poor
case
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
eeoc
guideline
and
the
interpretation
of
the
act
it
embodies.
and
in
the
footnote
in
the
same
brief,
speaking
i’m
certain
for
the
eeoc,
the
solicitor
said
that
in
light
of
these
same
factors,
the
eeoc
agrees
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
in
which
to
test
the
validity
of
its
guidelines,
and
therefore,
asked
the
court
not
to
grant
certiorari.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
just
proves
the
invalidity
of
the
eeoc's
reasoning
because
the
guideline
as
set
out
says
that
it
doesn’t
matter
what
the
facts
are.
if
you
have
the
employee
citizenship
criterion
for
employment,
then
you
got
a
violation.
but
we
don’t
want
you
to
look
[laughter
attempt]
at
the
facts
here
because
they’re
not
good
for
us.
and
if
that’s
the
case,
this
would
be
the
perfect
case
to
look
at.
and
we
suggest
that
the
reason
they
didn’t
want
the
court
to
grant
cert
was
because
they
knew
that
the
court
would
overrule
--
or
would
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
decision
and
throw
out
their
guideline.
counsel
did
raise
yesterday
and
in
this
brief
one
case
which
appears
to
have
some
similarity
between
our
case,
and
that’s
the
phillips
versus
martin
marietta.
superficially,
the
argument
is
the
same.
in
phillips
versus
martin
marietta,
martin
marietta
was
charged
with
sex
discrimination
against
women
and
they
defended
on
the
grounds,
“we
couldn’t
be
possibly
discriminating.
75%
of
our
employees
are
women.”
but
the
deference
was
that
as
to
all
potential
male
applicants,
martin
marietta
said,
“you’re
welcome.
we’re
going
to
look
at
you.”
as
to
women
applicants,
they
said,
“you’re
welcome
unless
you
have
a
child
under
six.”
now,
to
analogize
martin
marietta
to
farah
would
be
the
same
distinction
i
drew
earlier.
if
we
had
polish
aliens,
and
english
aliens,
and
french
aliens
but
not
mexican
aliens,
then
we’d
be
treating
the
person
differently,
but
we’re
not
and
therefore
martin
marietta
also
has
no
application.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
believe
yesterday
asked
mr.
cooper
whether
there
was
any
evidence
in
the
record
with
regard
to
who
was
hired
in
the
petitioner’s
place
and
mr.
cooper
said
that
there
was
none.
now,
in
the
appendix
at
page
89,
the
deposition
of
the
petitioner
is
reprinted.
she
was
asked
there,
“do
you
know
who
was
hired
for
the
job
for
which
you
were
applying?”
and
she
said,
“no,
sir.”
but
the
next
question
was,
“do
you
understand
that
those
persons
were
mexican-americans
with
mexican
ancestry,
but
who
are
united
states
citizens.”
she
answered,
“yes,
sir.”
now,
in
green
versus
mcdonald
douglas,
this
court
said
that
one
of
the
factors
that
needed
to
prove
up
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination
was
for
the
petitioner
to
show
or
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
a
person
of
a
different
race
had
been
hired
in
his
stead.
and
here,
it’s
clear
from
the
plaintiff’s
deposition
that
the
person
hired
in
her
stead
was
of
the
same
national
origin
as
she.
your
honor,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we'd
then
just
urge
that
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below
as
immanently
correct.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
reading
counsel’s
description
in
this
--
particularly
in
this
brief
of
the
plight
of
the
american
immigrant
in
the
1880’s
and
up
to
as
recently
as
45
or
50
years
ago
i
was
reminded
of
the
remarks
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
sand
door
case
with
the
carpenters
local
1976.
speaking
of
the
secondary
boycott
problems
in
that
case,
it
said
that
these
afford
a
striking
illustration.
the
importance
of
this
is
that
it
is
the
business
of
congress
to
declare
a
policy
and
not
this
courts.
the
judicial
function
is
confined
to
applying
what
congress
has
enacted
after
ascertaining
what
it
is
that
congress
has
enacted.
we’re
presented
here
with
a
simple
and
narrow
question
of
statutory
construction.
that
is
in
1964,
did
--
not
should
but
did
congress
intend
to
hold
an
employer’s
policy
of
hiring
only
united
states
citizens
where
all
parties
acknowledged
that
that
policy
has
been
applied
in
a
non-discriminatory
manner.
we
think
that
the
history
of
the
act
clearly
demonstrates
that
congress
had
no
such
intention.
before
discussing
the
factors
before
the
united
states
congress
and
suggest
--
note
that
there’s
been
only
one
case
other
than
the
district
court
in
this
case
which
has
applied
national
origin
in
a
way
that
petitioner’s
briefs
suggest
that
it
should
be
applied.
and
that
case
is
cited
in
petitioner’s
brief
as
london
board
of--
london
borough
of
ealing
versus
race
relations
board,and
there,
the
queen’s
best
division
applied
precisely,
the
statutory
construction
to
a
national
origin
statute
in
great
britain
that
the
petitioner
seeks
here.
that
decision
was
reversed
by
the
house
of
lords
in
1972.
and
aside
from
that
one
decision,
nobody
has
yet
agreed
with
counsel,
aside
from
that
one
in
the
district
court
here.
now,
what
was
before
the
congress
in
1964?
i’d
suggest
that
the
first
and
most
obvious
factor
before
the
court
was
that
of
the
employment
practices
of
the
federal
government
itself.
from
1914,
for
50
years,
eight
or
nine
consecutive
presidents
beginning
with
president
wilson
had
required
by
executive
order
that
in
order
to
sit
for
civil
service
examination,
an
individual
must
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
now,
at
various
times,
there
were
certainly
very
limited
exceptions
which
i
regard
as
totally
irrelevant
to
the
basic
issue
here.
for
the
last
21
of
those
years,
beginning
in
1943
and
under
president
roosevelt,
trumann,
eisenhower
and
kennedy,
the
same
presidents
who
re-affirmed
the
necessity
that
civil
service
applicant
must
be
a
citizen
by
executive
order
also
for
bad
discrimination
based
upon
among
other
things,
national
origin.
now
obviously,
for
21
years,
no
one
had
raised
the
contention
and
no
one
had
suggested
to
the
congress
that
these
two
policies
could
not
co-exist
side
by
side.
this
has
been
raised
in
one
case
that
i’m
aware
of
since
1964
in
mow
sun
wong
versus
hampton
in
the
northern
district
of
california
in
1971
where
a
group
of
chinese
aliens,
again,
under
statutory
construction
case,
sued
the
chairman
of
the
civil
service
commission
when
they
were
denied
the
right
to
sit
for
civil
service
examination
and
they
alleged
that
the
civil
service
rule
was
in
violation
of
what
by
then
was
statutory
federal
government
policy
of
not
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
national
origin
and
the
judge
there
said
that
there
was
no
problem
that
the
two
statutes
or
the
two
policies
could
easily
co-exist.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
it’s
the
only
case,
i’m
aware
of.
yes,
your
honor.
the
next
area
that
was
before
the
congress
when
it
was
enacting
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
was
the
fact
that
according
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
some
28
states
had
enacted
fair
employment
practices
legislation
at
the
time
that
civil
rights
act
of
1964
was
passed.
the
various
fair
employment
practices
commissions
of
those
states
in
19
--
pardon
me.
one
of
the
factors
virtually
all
of
these
28
for
bad
discrimination
based
early
on
national
origin
and/or
national
ancestry.
19
of
these
state
fair
employment
practices
commissions
had
discussed
and
considered
the
question
of
whether
under
their
policy,
an
employer
could
still
require
citizenship.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
at
recess,
we
were
examining
some
of
the
factors
that
the
congress
had
before
at
the
time
it
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
we’d
looked
at
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
operating
under
the
same
prohibitory
languages
as
is
contained
in
title
vii
of
civil
rights
act,
so
no
inconsistency
for
21
years
in
applying
the
same
policy
that
farah
applies.
then
we
were
in
process
of
looking
at
the
fact
that
some
19
state
fair
employment
practice
commissions
as
of
1964
had
addressed
themselves
to
the
question
of
whether
they
under
their
own
fep
legislation
barring
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
national
origin
or
national
ancestry,
an
employer
could
nevertheless
require
that
his
employees
be
citizens
and
of
those
19
states,
18
had
found
no
inconsistency
in
the
policy.
then
we
turn
if
we
may
to
the
debate
surrounding
the
1964
act
itself,
and
of
course,
the
very
first
thing
we’re
faced
with
is
the
remark
of
congressman
roosevelt
who
is
chairman
of
the
house
subcommittee
which
reported
out
what
became
the
civil
rights
act
and
in
the
course
of
being
questioned
on
the
floor
of
the
house
with
regard
to
what
national
origin
meant,
he
said,
“i
just
made
very
clear
that
national
origin
means
national.
it
means
the
country
from
you
and
your
fore
bearers
came
from.
you
may
come
from
poland,
czechoslovakia,
england,
france
or
any
other
country.”
and
with
that,
the
subject
was
dropped.
now,
in
his
brief,
mr.
cooper
points
out
that
this
is
isolated,
that
there’s
only
one
such
illustration
in
the
debate
and
i
might
suggest
there
that
the
reason
is
because
the
reason
was
so
obvious
that
once
answered
in
the
normal
understanding
of
the
word,
there
was
no
further
necessity
for
expanding
them.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
because
your
honor,
they
hold
that
the
national
origin
prohibition
in
the
act
means
that
it’s
unlawful
for
farah
in
the
facts
of
this
case
to
discriminate
against
people
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
they
or
their
ancestors
came
from
mexico.
the
facts
in
this
case
clearly
show
that
there
has
been
no
such
discrimination.
rather
the
discrimination,
and
it
exists,
there
is
discrimination,
no
question,
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
person
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
now,
under
congressman
roosevelt’s
language,
if
farah
had
a
policy
of
hiring
nationals
from
poland,
from
czechoslovakia,
from
england
and
france,
but
not
nationals
of
mexico,
then
there
would
be
discrimination
on
the
national
origin
of
the
individual
and
it
would
clearly
be
prohibited.
but
everybody
acknowledges
and
all
the
facts
stand
clear
that
that’s
not
farah’s
policy.
the
only
other
reference
to
somewhere
to
this
that
we
were
able
to
find
was
in
the
debates
or
the
hearings
before
congressman
roosevelt’s
committee
where
then
secretary
of
labor,
willard
wirtz
was
described
in
the
federal
policy
of
complaint
processing
on
the
grounds
of
employment
discrimination
within
the
government.
and
secretary
wirtz’s
attention
obviously
was
primarily
with
regard
to
racial
discrimination,
but
then
he
turned
to
national
origin
and
religious
discrimination
and
he
said,
“for
example,
if
a
person
feels
that
he’s
been
disadvantaged
because
he
is
of
mexican,
italian
or
polish
origin,
then
he
files
a
complaint
with
the
commission
and
proceeds.”
now,
obviously,
it
was
implicit
in
what
secretary
wirtz
was
saying
that
every
single
one
of
those
people
were
united
states
citizens.
they
wouldn’t
even
been
employees
of
the
federal
government
if
they
weren’t.
section
701
(b),
which
has
now
been
--
of
title
vii
which
is
now
recodified
into
5
u.s.c.
7151,
declares
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
not
to
discriminate
on
the
grounds
of
national
origin
and
yet,
no
one
understood
that
this
was
changing
the
federal
policy.
it
was
only
making
statutory
what’s
theretofore
been
the
rule
by
executive
order
and
everyone
understood
that
the
federal
government
was
still
going
to
limit
its
employment
practices
--
employment
hiring
to
united
states
citizens.
and
indeed,
i’ll
direct
your
attention
if
i
might,
to
the
brief
filed
herein
on
the
motion
for
a
certiorari
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
where
he
says
that
the
us
agrees
with
the
fifth
circuit’s
interpretation
that
congress
construed
the
phrase
to
mean
ancestry
rather
than
citizenship,
and
then
he
makes
the
obvious
point
in
a
footnote
that
surely
congress
intended
that
the
same
meaning
be
applied
to
section
701
(b)
of
title
vii
as
it
applied
in
section
703
(a).
the
words
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
that’s
right
but
the
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
well,
right
and
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
it
is.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
depending
on
the
circumstances,
i
think
it’s
three
to
five
years.
i
think
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
that’s
correct
and
i’d
say
frankly,
your
honor,
that
if
more
companies
had
the
policy
that
farah
has,
congress
would
probably
see
fit
to
change
the
law.
what
we’re
suggesting
is
that
so
far,
they
haven’t.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
precisely.
and
i
think
that’s
the
only
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
no
sir,
i
don’t
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
a
few
but
not
major
ones,
your
honor.
1981
of
course,
as
i
think,
for
the
reasons
that
both
justice
blackmun
and
justice
marshall
pointed
out
yesterday,
is
not
before
us.
but
even
if
it
were,
the
courts
that
have
faced
the
question
with
that
one
single
exception
have
held
at
section
1981
does
not
apply
to
national
origin
discrimination.
they
do
so
primarily
on
the
basis
that
mr.
justice
stewart’s
decision
in
jones
versus
meyer
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
correct.
either
way,
if
they
used
the
thirteenth
by
the
terms
it
applies
only
to
racial
discrimination.
if
they
used
the
fourteenth,
then
it
applies
to
state
action.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
we’re
not
suggesting
here,
your
honor,
that
the
congress
could
not
outlaw
or
prohibit
farah’s
policy
under
the
immigration
policy.
it
could.
we
only
suggest
that
so
far,
it
hadn’t.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
well,
your
honor,
it’s
clear
that
congress
understood
that
it
was
acting
pursuant
to
one.
i
think
that
sheds
real
light
on
the
congressional
understanding
of
what
they
are
purporting
to
do.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
i
don’t
need
to
bother
the
court
really
with
it.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
the
cases
that
have
held
that
1981
does
not
apply
to
a
racial
discrimination,
it’s
interesting
that
the
only
case
and
it’s
cited
in
mr.
cooper’s
brief
that
holds
to
the
contrary
is
guerra
versus
manchester
terminal
which
is
now
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit,
and
i
think
it
will
be
reversed.
but
even
guerra
recognizes
that
the
act
was
found
--
that
section
1981
was
founded
on
the
thirteenth
amendment.
i
think
for
that
reason,
guerra
is
clearly
wrong
and
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
will
reverse
it.
to
expand
a
little
further
on
the
suggestion
of
what
the
view
of
the
united
states.
it’s
been
the
policy
for
a
number
of
years
of
the
united
states
to
put
in
various
appropriations
acts
that
no
money
expended
under
this
or
any
other
appropriation
act
in
this
fiscal
year
will
be
used
to
a
certain,
again,
limited
exceptions
to
pay
aliens.
now,
to
give
the
reading
to
title
vii
that
mr.
cooper
and
petitioner
ask,
you’d
have
to
assume
that
in
1964,
congress
on
the
one
hand
said,
“from
now
on,
the
federal
government’s
going
to
hire
aliens,
but
we’re
just
not
going
to
pay
them.”
obviously,
that
was
not
the
congressional
intent.
now,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court’s
attention
for
a
second
to
the
question
of
the
eeoc
regulations.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
your
honor
--
mr.
kenneth
r.
carr
your
honor,
there
is
in
the
record,
the
recognition
that
one
time,
farah
deviated
from
that
policy.
now,
it’s
not
in
the
record
and
i
apologize
both
to
counsel
and
the
court,
i
represented
the
facts
in
my
brief
and
they
are
correct,
but
they’re
not
contained
in
the
record
now.
that’s
because
we
weren’t
asked
on
an
interrogatory,
it
would’ve
come
out,
but
there’s
been
one
single
exception
in
the
history
of
the
company,
your
honor.
while
mr.
chief
justice
burger
in
griggs
pointed
out
that
eeoc
guidelines
are
entitled
to
great
difference
and
we
don’t
quarrel
for
that
--
with
that
for
a
moment.
he
then
said
that
the
reason
they
do
is
that
since
the
act
in
its
legislative
history
support
the
commission’s
conclusion,
this
affords
good
reason
to
treat
the
guidelines
as
expressed
in
the
will
of
congress.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
analogous
to
a
fair
labor
standards
act
situation
where
this
court
in
skidmore
versus
swift
and
consistently
since
has
said
that
interpretative
bulletins
of
the
secretary
of
labor
and
wage
hour
cases
are
entitled
to
great
weight.
but
in
skidmore
versus
swift
itself,
the
court
held
that
the
reason
they
are
is
because
of
the
weight
of
such
judgment,
in
a
particular
case,
it
said
will
depend
on
the
thoroughness
evident
in
its
consideration
upon
the
validity
of
its
reasoning
and
all
those
other
factors
which
give
these
interpretative
bulletins
the
power
to
persuade,
if
not
the
power
to
control.
and
the
courts
while
giving
tremendous
deference
and
have
[laughter
attempt]
been
on
the
losing
side
of
one
or
two
to
interpretative
bulletins
of
the
secretary
of
labor,
they
don’t
hesitate
to
overrule
them
where
they’re
wrong.
now,
we
think
that
that’s
precisely
what
the
court
should
do
in
griggs,
i’m
sorry
in
farah.
in
support
of
that,
we’d
show
you
what
we
regard
as
the
fatal
flaw
in
the
eeoc’s
reasoning
and
again,
direct
you
attention
to
the
memorandum
on
the
question
of
whether
certiorari
should
be
granted.
the
solicitor
general
pointed
to
the
record
of
farah
in
employing
people
of
mexican
origin.
and
the
fact
that
over
90%
of
our
employees
have
such
origin
and
the
he
referred
this
to
the
atypical
factual
situation
presented
here
which
makes
this
a
poor
case
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
eeoc
guideline
and
the
interpretation
of
the
act
it
embodies.
and
in
the
footnote
in
the
same
brief,
speaking
i’m
certain
for
the
eeoc,
the
solicitor
said
that
in
light
of
these
same
factors,
the
eeoc
agrees
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
in
which
to
test
the
validity
of
its
guidelines,
and
therefore,
asked
the
court
not
to
grant
certiorari.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
just
proves
the
invalidity
of
the
eeoc's
reasoning
because
the
guideline
as
set
out
says
that
it
doesn’t
matter
what
the
facts
are.
if
you
have
the
employee
citizenship
criterion
for
employment,
then
you
got
a
violation.
but
we
don’t
want
you
to
look
[laughter
attempt]
at
the
facts
here
because
they’re
not
good
for
us.
and
if
that’s
the
case,
this
would
be
the
perfect
case
to
look
at.
and
we
suggest
that
the
reason
they
didn’t
want
the
court
to
grant
cert
was
because
they
knew
that
the
court
would
overrule
--
or
would
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
decision
and
throw
out
their
guideline.
counsel
did
raise
yesterday
and
in
this
brief
one
case
which
appears
to
have
some
similarity
between
our
case,
and
that’s
the
phillips
versus
martin
marietta.
superficially,
the
argument
is
the
same.
in
phillips
versus
martin
marietta,
martin
marietta
was
charged
with
sex
discrimination
against
women
and
they
defended
on
the
grounds,
“we
couldn’t
be
possibly
discriminating.
75%
of
our
employees
are
women.”
but
the
deference
was
that
as
to
all
potential
male
applicants,
martin
marietta
said,
“you’re
welcome.
we’re
going
to
look
at
you.”
as
to
women
applicants,
they
said,
“you’re
welcome
unless
you
have
a
child
under
six.”
now,
to
analogize
martin
marietta
to
farah
would
be
the
same
distinction
i
drew
earlier.
if
we
had
polish
aliens,
and
english
aliens,
and
french
aliens
but
not
mexican
aliens,
then
we’d
be
treating
the
person
differently,
but
we’re
not
and
therefore
martin
marietta
also
has
no
application.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
believe
yesterday
asked
mr.
cooper
whether
there
was
any
evidence
in
the
record
with
regard
to
who
was
hired
in
the
petitioner’s
place
and
mr.
cooper
said
that
there
was
none.
now,
in
the
appendix
at
page
89,
the
deposition
of
the
petitioner
is
reprinted.
she
was
asked
there,
“do
you
know
who
was
hired
for
the
job
for
which
you
were
applying?”
and
she
said,
“no,
sir.”
but
the
next
question
was,
“do
you
understand
that
those
persons
were
mexican-americans
with
mexican
ancestry,
but
who
are
united
states
citizens.”
she
answered,
“yes,
sir.”
now,
in
green
versus
mcdonald
douglas,
this
court
said
that
one
of
the
factors
that
needed
to
prove
up
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination
was
for
the
petitioner
to
show
or
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
a
person
of
a
different
race
had
been
hired
in
his
stead.
and
here,
it’s
clear
from
the
plaintiff’s
deposition
that
the
person
hired
in
her
stead
was
of
the
same
national
origin
as
she.
your
honor,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we'd
then
just
urge
that
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below
as
immanently
correct.
thank
you,
your
honor.
