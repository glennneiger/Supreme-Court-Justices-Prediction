justice
byron
r.
white
technically,
i
suppose,
you
could
say
there
is
a
discrimination
against
people
who
were
born
abroad
in
the
sense
that
--
or
against
people
who
weren’t
born
in
this
country,
who
didn’t
originate
in
this
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
technically,
that
is
because
those
people
who
were
born
abroad
have
to
satisfy
an
employment
qualification
that
people
born
here
don’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
now
technically,
that’s
it.
so
your
argument
has
to
be
that
isn't
what
congress
intended?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i’ve
said,
this
is
substantial
discrimination,
isn’t
it?
i
mean,
it’s
a
substantial
qualification.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
takes
--
how
long
does
it
take
to
be
naturalized?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
just
don’t
get
a
job
in
this
country
with
the
federal
government
or
with
your
client
for
quite
a
while?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
argument
is
it's
strictly
a
congressional
intention
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
isn’t
a
--
well,
you
don’t
think
the
1981
argument
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
some
problems
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
a
power
of
question.
they
couldn’t
have
used
the
thirteenth
amendment,
they
had
to
use
the
fourteenth
which
means
a
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
immigration
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
do
you
think
it’s
the
practice
of
the
courts
to
invalidate
an
act
of
congress
that
would
be
valid
under
power
x
just
because
congress
purported
to
use
only
power
y?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice

i’m
