justice
john
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
the
phrase
“national
origin.”
in
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
mrs.
espinoza,
a
citizen
of
mexico
who
resides
in
san
antonio,
was
refused
employment
by
farah
manufacturing
company
because
she
is
not
a
united
states
citizen.
we
hold
today
that
an
employer's
refusal
of
the
hirer
person
because
he
or
she
is
not
a
united
state
citizen
does
not,
standing
by
itself,
constitute
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
the
quoted
words
national
origin.
we
reach
this
holding
in
line
for
the
most
part
on
the
clear
indication
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
turn
national
origin
to
embrace
citizenship
requirements.
two
points
deserve
emphasis.
first
the
question
presented
is
not
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
prohibit
private
discrimination
because
of
alienage
nor
whether
congress
itself
discriminate
against
non-citizens
in
federal
employment.
the
question
is
not
what
congress
can
do
or
should
do,
but
what
congress
did
in
the
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act.
second,
the
record
in
this
case,
conclusively
shows
that
farah
did
not
discriminate
against
persons
of
mexican
national
origin.
in
fact,
96%
of
farah’s
employees
are
of
mexican
national
origin,
as
was
the
individual
hired
in
mrs.
espinoza’s
place.
the
company’s
policy
and
our
holding
is
limited
to
a
citizenship
requirement
which
is
applied
in
an
ethically
neutral
manner
barring
employment
of
a
blue
eyed
blond
haired
citizen
of
sweden,
a
black
skinned
citizen
of
nigeria
or
a
spanish
speaking
citizen
of
mexico.
discrimination
against
persons
of
mexican
national
origin,
like
discrimination
against
women
or
negroes
is
also
forbidden
under
title
7,
but
nothing
in
title
7
was
intended
to
prohibit
an
employer
from
applying
a
racially
neutral
and
ethically
neutral
requirement
of
united
states
citizenship.
