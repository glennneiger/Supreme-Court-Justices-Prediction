do
you
put
this
in
the
same
category
as
a
contractor
that
uses
80%
cement
instead
of
81%.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
contractor
uses
81%
of
the
cement
instead
of
85%
of
the
cement,
so
he
is
punished
for
it.
isn't
that
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
this
stadium,
if
he’s
getting
ready
to
build
it,
if
he
doesn’t
live
up
to
his
specifications
that
he
agrees
to
build
the
stadium,
he’s
punished
by
the
state
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
put
this
in
the
same
category.
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
you
said
is
just
he
breaks
the
contract,
he
knows
all
his
doings.
he
makes
the
contract
and
then
he
breaks
it
and
therefore
he
severed.
i
think
there’s
a
difference.
