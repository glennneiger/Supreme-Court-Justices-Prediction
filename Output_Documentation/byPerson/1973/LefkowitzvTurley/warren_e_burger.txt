we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
72-331,
lefkowitz
against
turley.
miss
soloff,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
soloff,
suppose
as
a
condition
to
getting
the
contract
along
the
lines
of
mr.
justice
white
was
discussing
with
you,
the
state
presented
the
contractor,
the
would
be
contractor
with
half
a
dozen
standard
forms
of
waiver
of
immunity
with
the
title
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
date
and
all
that
left
in
blank,
and
just
got
these
waivers
signed
in
blank.
would
you
think
that
would
pass
muster?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
then
from
what
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
justice
white
was
suggesting
that
this
was
a
de
facto
waiver
of
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
soloff,
in
the
gardner
case,
you
remember
that
line
that
undertook
to
distinguish
between
the
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
and
the
refusal
to
answer
very
specific
questions
relating
to
the
performance
of
duties
or
contract.
would
the
state
of
new
york
in
your
view,
not
have
adequate
protection
if
this
architect
we
called
before
the
grand
jury
asked
the
specific
questions
which
the
gardner
case
purported
to
say
if
that’s
still
good
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
under
new
york
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
extent
then,
does
this
affect
this
importance
of
this
case
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
robinson,
while
the
subject
is
fresh
in
your
mind
as
i’m
sure
it
is
from
listening
to
the
colloquy,
i
wonder
if
you
would
suggest
what
difference
there
is
between
that
provision
in
the
gardner
opinion
of
this
court
of
which,
does
that
--
whether
it
is
just
alright
to
penalize
a
policeman
or
someone
else
for
exercising
his
constitutional
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
but
it
wasn’t
alright,
it
wasn’t
constitutional
to
require
someone
to
waive
that
in
advance
which
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
was
speaking
of
that
one
paragraph
in
the
gardner
case
in
which
the
court
said
that,
if
the
appellant,
the
policeman
and
refused
to
answer
questions
specifically
directed
and
narrowly
related
to
the
performance
of
his
official
duties
without
being
required
to
waive
immunity
in
advance
then
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
would
not
have
been
a
bar
to
his
dismissal
but
that
still
in
fact
is
the
law
and
not
just
a
view
of
collateral
question,
it
would
mean
that
the
policeman
is
penalized
for
exercising
constitutional
right,
isn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
if
this
paragraph
is
still
the
law,
he
can
still
be
penalized
by
being
fired.
however,
i’m
simply
saying
that
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
penalties,
one
of
which
the
court
said
it
is
all
right
to
direct
against
the
policeman
and
the
other
is
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
one
case,
he’s
immune
from
criminal
prosecution
for
the
conduct
for
whatever
happens
but
in
the
other
case,
he
can
be
fired
from
his
job
so
that
there
are
just
two
different
kinds
of
penalties
directed
at
the
same
exercise
or
the
exercise
of
a
similar
constitutional
privilege
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven’t
wished
as
far
as
my
understanding
indicated
what
is
the
difference
between
penalizing
the
man
after
the
event
and
the
thread
of
criminal
prosecution
for
what
is
the
constitutional
distinction,
i’m
well
aware
that
one
is
civil,
economic
remedy,
and
dismissal
from
employment
and
the
other
is
exposure
to
criminal
prosecution.
they’re
both
coercive
in
terms
of
exercise
of
the
constitutional
right,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
you
think
what
the
court
said
in
the
gardner
was
probably
doubtful.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doubtful
constitutional
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
i
would
well

well.

your
time
is
all
is
used
up,

you
