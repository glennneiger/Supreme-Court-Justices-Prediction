unknown
speaker
wasn't
your
question
the
validity
in
the
waiver
and
if
there
is
a
waiver,
there
is
no
violation.
unknown
speaker
let’s
put
it,
the
waiver
said
in
it
--
when
the
blank
waiver
said
in
it,
covered
only
having
things
to
do
with
his
contracts
with
the
state.
unknown
speaker
automatic
transaction
in
this
immunity
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
to
any
witness
called
before
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
doesn’t
claim
the
privilege?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
probably
will
turn
on
a
new
york
problem.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn’t
new
york
be
satisfied
with
the
rule
that
said
that
the
--
surely
the
state
may
question
a
contractor
about
his
performance
of
the
contract?
and
have
indicated
so
--
terminating
the
contract
or
finding
out
what’s
going
on
but
that
his
answers
may
not
be
used
against
the
human
criminal
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
be
free
to
use
his
answers
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
haven’t
you
also
said
that
in
certain
state
of
new
york
law
as
such
that
even
if
he
waived
immunity.
he
might
still
be
able
to
use
his
answers
against
some
of
the
criminal
questions.
unknown
speaker
this
would
tell
(inaudible)
transaction
with
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
court
held
in
gardner
that
he
was
being
penalized
for
asserting
the
constitutional
right,
i.e.
for
refusing
to
waive
immunity
that
is
what
gardner
helped
to
decide
--
unknown
speaker
i
didn’t
join
the
opinion
but
--
may
not
be
the
authority
is
to
what
it
held.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
want
to
be
--
you’re
not
satisfied
with
utilizing
that
device
and
being
able
to
question
the
contractor
about
the
performance
of
this
contract
with
the
understanding
that
those
answers
would
not
be
used
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
just
use
of
immunity.
you’re
not
satisfied
with
that.
you
want
to
be
able
to
use
those
answers
perhaps.
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
are
not
satisfied.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
attraction
of
all
the
validity
of
the
law
that
the
new
york
legislature
passed,
maybe
you
might
be
satisfied
with
it
but
the
new
york’s
legislature
has
passed
a
different
law.
that’s
the
one
involved
here.
unknown
speaker
but
underlying
that
position
is
that
you
can’t
really
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
has
happened
unless
you
can
get
the
information
from
the
contractor
himself.
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
basic
reason,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
because
it
says
without
being
required
to
waive
his
immunity.
and
of
course
if
he
--
if
he
was
granted
immunity,
then
of
course
he
could
be
asked
any
questions,
a
policeman
or
bricklayer
or
a
judge
or
anybody
else
if
he
has
been
granted
immunity
then
he
has
no
more
constitutional
privilege.
unknown
speaker
well,
what’s
your
explanation
for
why
a
contractor
--
responsible
contractor
shouldn’t
be
bound
by
his
agreement
in
advance
that
if
he
refuses
to
answer
questions
about
his
contract
that
he
can’t
do
anymore
business
with
the
city
for
a
period
of
time.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
contractor
didn't
know
about
it?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
he
did.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
you
assume
he
did
then
why
should
not
he
be
bound
by
that
agreement
that
he
must
terminate
business
relation
with
the
state
unless
he
refuses
to
answer
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
went
into
--
he
signed
a
contract
with
the
state.
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
law
said
that
if
you
do
that,
there
are
some
certain
consequences
that
come
over.
unknown
speaker
it
must
all
be
technical.
for
the
purposes
of
this
question,
let’s
assume
that
it
had
the
provision
in
it
that
said,
precisely
what
the
law
said.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
you
have
to
get
to.
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
is?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
which
required
a
waiver
in
advance
of
your
rights
or
waiver
of
your,
or
whatever
is
the
objective
here
and
now
withdrawn
when
you
wouldn’t
see
any
problem
with
terms
of
contractor.
unknown
speaker
and
that
even
if
the
questions
that
the
state
wanted
to
ask
in
this
case
or
the
right
kinds
of
questions,
the
statute
might
authorize
other
kinds
of
questions
and
therefore
was
invalid
on
the
state.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
really
is
a
straight
over
breadth
argument.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
your
question
the
validity
in
the
waiver
and
if
there
is
a
waiver,
there
is
no
violation.
