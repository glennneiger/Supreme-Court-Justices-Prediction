justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
same
premise
that
the
government
employees,
the
premise
that
the
taxpayer
are
going
to
get
the
honest
performance
of
their
labor
in
return
for
the
compensation
pay
for
them,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
why
this
is
different
from
the
gardner
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
if
the
new
york
city
policemen
and
gardner
knew
about
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
appear
in
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
each
case,
the
basic
situation
is
that
the
contractor
in
a
one
case
and
the
employee
in
the
other
case,
when
called
before
grand
jury,
must
waive
his
immunity,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i.e.,
termination.
justice
potter
stewart
suspension
of
the
contractor
for
period
of
years,
termination
of
the
policeman
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
his
employment
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
this
case,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
contractor
is
sufficiently
different
from
an
employee,
so
that
the
rule
of
the
gardner
case
does
not
apply.
is
that
really
what
it
comes
down
to?
justice
potter
stewart
otherwise,
we
would
have
to
reconsider
the
gardner
principle,
the
gardner
constitutional
principle,
would
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
agreement
of
the
contract
is
in
the
form
of
a
waiver
of
immunity?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
he
--
so,
there
is
--
if
he
refuses
to
sign
a
contract
with
that
condition
in
it,
then
he
is
not
going
to
get
the
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there
is
a
condition
or
a
barrier
to
doing
things
with
the
state
which
amounts
to
a
waiver
of
immunity.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
eventually
it
will
amount
to
that
because
he
can’t
get
the
next
contract
if
he
reaches
that
provision.
justice
potter
stewart
it
must
be
during
the
waive
of
immunity
he
can’t
get
more
than
one
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
sooner
or
later,
it
amounts
to
he
either
waives
of
immunity
or
he
doesn’t
do
business
with
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
when
a
person
does
enough
business
with
the
state
or
perhaps
when
he’s
informed
enough
then
you
can
expect
him
to
have
advice
of
the
counsel
of
what
not
you
should.
you
should
sustain
a
state’s
insistence
upon
a
waiver,
in
advance,
which
--
let’s
don’t
quiver
about
what
there
is
or
isn’t.
you
say
it
isn’t.
i
look
at
it
as
sooner
or
later
as
an
enforced
labor.
you
just
say
that
the
contract
that
you
ought
to
uphold
in
an
advance
waiver
by
well
enough
informed
person.
justice
potter
stewart
it
can’t
really
be
a
balancing
process
and
so
far
as
you
can’t
--
can
you
concede
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
that’s
been
held
to
be
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
and
then
say
nonetheless
we
should
just
to
over
look
at
in
the
interest
of
the
taxpayers
in
the
state
of
new
york.
that’s
hardly
--
you
cannot
concede
the
violation,
can
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
ask
this
just
to
balance
that
out
in
the
interest
of
the
taxpayers
in
the
state
of
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
have
a
little
difficulty
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
anything
in
the
written
contract
that
referred
to
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you’re
simply
relying
on
the
presumption
of
the
knowledge
of
the
law
that
is
part
of
everybody
plus
the
fact
that
this
was
presumably
a
sophisticated
contractor
with
good
legal
advice.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
my
question.
is
there
any
real
dispute
about
this
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
about
what?
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
there,
i
asked
you
before.
what
is
the
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter
that
was
involved
in
the
gardner
case?
there’s
no
indication
on
that
opinion.
i
just
read
it
as
to
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
policeman.
but
do
we
know
the
chronology
if
that
was
a
part
of
the
city
charter
the
time
that
policeman
got
his
job?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
same
case
you’re
here,
would
not
it
on
this
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
said
were
or
it's
a
similar
predecessor
provision
on
the
part
of
the
city
charter
at
the
time
of
the
policeman,
gardner,
got
a
job
that
would
be
just
the
same
situation
as
it
is
here
with
no
indication
that
he
did
not
know
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
in
my
observation
that
employees
generally
know
how
to
deal
about
the
condition
of
the
job.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
something
else,
that
is
a
different
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
different
branch
of
the
organization.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
is
a
--
the
state
is
really
taking
a
less
severe
approach
than
perhaps
it
could.
it
doesn’t
exist
on
a
waiver
but
it
might.
it
says
really
we
don’t
insist
that
you
waive
in
advance
and
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
have
your
statements
used
against
you.
you
can
choose
not
to
have
your
statements
used
against
you
at
the
later
day
but
the
cost
to
you
is
you
cannot
do
anymore
business
with
us
for
a
while.
justice
potter
stewart
ms.
soloff,
is
there
any
legislative
history
of
this
state
legislation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
indicating
the
kinds
of
evils
to
what
he
was
addressed?
is
it
bribing
public
officials
to
award
contract
or
is
it
substandard
performance
by
contractors
or
both
or
is
there
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
really,
thank
you
very
much.
it’s
a
very
nice
--
very
nice
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
really
just
say
here,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
pass
this
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
seized
on
this
paragraph
--
justice

is
that
the

why
this
