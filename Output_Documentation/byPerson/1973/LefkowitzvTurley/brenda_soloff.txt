ms.
brenda
soloff
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
ability
of
the
state,
in
this
case
new
york
and
its
subdivisions
here,
eerie
county.
to
provide
themselves
with
some
reliable
assurance
that
in
committing
public
funds
to
independent
contractors,
the
contractors
will
deal
with
them
openly
and
candidly,
when
information
is
sought
about
those
contracts.
two
related
sets
of
new
york
statutes
were
struck
down
by
the
district
court.
the
first,
in
which
new
york
general
municipal
law
section
103
a
is
an
example,
requires
each
public
contract
to
contain
a
provision
that
if
a
person
who
is
called
before
a
grand
jury,
or
other
agency,
which
is
authorized
to
subpoena
and
swear
witnesses.
such
a
person
is
called
to
testify
in
an
investigation
concerning
a
public
contract
and
he
refuses
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
against
subsequent
criminal
prosecution,
or
to
answer
any
relevant
question
concerning
that
contract
or
transaction,
then
that
person
and
any
business
organization
of
which
he
is
a
member
or
officer
shall
be
disqualified
from
public
contracting
for
five
years,
and
existing
contracts
maybe
canceled.
that’s
the
first
set
of
statutes
involved.
the
second
group
statutes
struck
down
below
and
which
new
york
general
municipal
law
section
103
b
is
an
example,
is
directed
at
already
completed
contracts
and
transactions
and
establishes
a
five-year
disqualification
from
future
contracting
for
a
similar
refusal
to
cooperate
under
similar
circumstances.
both
of
these
statutes
and
related
statutes,
which
are
similar
in
other
sections
of
new
york
law,
were
struck
down
by
the
district
court.
the
two
appellees
in
this
case,
are
licensed
architects
and
members
of
a
partnership
which
according
to
the
complaint
had
various
contracts
with
eerie
county.
the
only
one
of
these
contracts
which
is
specifically
mentioned
in
the
complaint,
concerns
the
construction
of
a
domed
stadium
in
eerie
county,
similar
to
the
astrodome
in
houston.
in
answering
the
complaint
in
the
district
court,
the
eerie
county
attorney
admitted
the
existence
of
various
contracts
and
of
the
stadium
contract.
this
is
the
only
information
in
the
record
about
contracts
between
appellees
and
any
publications
in
new
york.
on
february
8,
1971,
while
under
public
contract,
the
two
appellees
and
another
member
of
the
partnership
were
subpoenaed
to
testify
before
an
eerie
county
grand
jury
respecting
transactions
and
contracts
that
they
had
with
the
county.
all
three
were
presented
with
waivers
of
immunity
which
they
were
asked
to
sign.
all
three
refused.
the
third
member
of
the
partnership
then
was
granted
immunity
and
testified.
the
other
two
did
not,
and
did
not
testify.
the
appropriate
authorities
were
informed
of
the
refusals
and
the
instant
action
followed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york,
claiming
that
they
had
in
the
past
and
wished
in
the
future
to
contract
with
the
state
and
its
agencies,
the
appellees
claimed
that
the
statutes
violated
their
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
a
three-judge
district
court,
and
what
must
be
regarded
as
an
over
extension
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
gardner
v.
broderick
and
its
companion
cases
agreed,
and
the
statutes
were
enjoined.
however,
in
seeking
to
protect
the
public
interest,
the
state
has
not
acted
unreasonably
towards
its
contractors.
the
state
and
the
businessman
enter
not
only
into
a
business
arrangement,
but
into
something
of
a
social
contract
as
well.
the
state
begins
with
a
premise,
that
public
money
must
be
well
and
carefully
spent.
neither
cost
nor
quality
must
be
painted
by
graft,
bribery,
the
use
of
inferior
materials,
or
any
other
unseen
impermissible
factor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
right,
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
different
from
the
gardner
case
in
a
number
of
respects.
a
contractor,
when
he
enters
into
a
contract,
understands
at
the
beginning
what
is
expected
of
him.
he
hasn’t
committed
his
life,
his
career,
his
ability
to
earn
a
living
through
this
contract.
he’s
seeking
profit
from
an
episodic
source.
he
knows
at
the
time
that
he
enters
it,
enters
the
contract
that
this
kind
of
information
will
be
required
of
him.
ms.
brenda
soloff
section
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
does
not
appear
in
the
case,
your
honor.
section
1123
of
the
city
charter
is
undoubtedly
a
harder
thing
to
find.
that’s
one
thing
that
can
be
said
about
it.
beyond
that,
contractors
typically
enter
contracts
with
attorneys.
they
have
typically
knowledge,
they
have
the
advice
of
the
counsel
at
the
time
they
enter
contracts.
and
the
contract
itself
is
for
a
limited
span
of
time.
a
policeman
doesn’t
consider
perhaps
every
possible
ramification
of
his
employment
at
the
time
he
takes
that
civil
service
examination,
doesn’t
have
the
advice
of
counsel,
typically.
and
the
section
1123
was
very
different
from
the
statutes
that
we
have
in
this
case.
the
statutes
in
this
case
request
to
information
concerning
any
transaction
or
contract.
section
1123
of
the
city
charter
talks
about
any
kind
of
activity
in
city
government.
it’s
much
broader
than
the
scope
of
the
duties
of
the
policeman.
it
involves
local
elections;
it
involves
any
aspect
of
city
government
which
might
possibly
occur
to
an
investigating
agency.
it
isn’t
limited
to
the
scope
of
the
employment
of
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
either
waives
--
the
agreement
that
he
makes
is
either
to
the
contractors
makes.
i
think
that
there’s
a
much
closer
question
as
to
whether
the
public
employee
makes
such
an
agreement.
the
agreement
he
makes
is
not
to
waive
immunity.
the
agreement
he
makes
is
if
he
does
not
waive
immunity,
then
certain
the
economic
consequences
will
follow.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i.e.,
termination.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that
is
right.
termination
of
this
particular
contract
is
discretionary
and
disqualification
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
the
consequences
to
a
contractor
are
far
less,
devastating
than
they
are
of
course
to
an
employee.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
is
what
it
comes
down
to,
your
honor.
although,
i
think
the
court
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
reconsideration
of
the
gardner
principle
itself.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that’s
perfectly
correct.
but
that
the
--
the
consequences
of
what
happens
to
a
contractor
have
to
be
considered
from
the
point
of
view
or
at
the
point
in
time
of
what
he
bargained
for.
what
was
it
that
he
bargained
for
at
the
time
he
went
into
the
contract?
what
was
his
understanding?
i
think
one
thing
that’s
perfectly
clear
is
that
the
interests
of
the
state
are
both
urgent
and
vital.
in
the
public
contractor
and
in
a
public
employee
situation,
it
is
also
clear
that
a
contractor
has
a
higher
obligation
than
the
ordinary
citizen
to
provide
information
with
respect
at
least
to
the
relationship
which
he
has
with
the
state.
if
he’s
unwilling
to
provide
the
information,
then
the
relationship
should
not
continue.
so,
that
the
businessman
understands
when
he
goes
after
a
contract
on
which
he’s
seeking
to
make
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
but
before
that
money,
and
even
perhaps
public
safety
will
be
committed
to
him,
he
must
be
willing
to
accept
certain
preventive
measures
and
to
cooperate
in
any
necessary
detection
of
wrong
doing
doing
because
typically
in
a
situation
involving
contracts,
detection
of
wrong
doing
will
be
difficult.
so
then
he
enters
into
the
special
relationship
with
the
state
and
he
agrees
that
not
withstanding
any
possible
consequences,
should
the
time
come,
he
will
be
open
and
honest.
even
if
it
means
that
the
evidence
will
be
used
against
him
and
that
he
will
be
brought
to
justice.
obviously,
a
principal
benefit
of
this
understanding
is
prevention.
corruption
may
well
be
nipped
in
the
bud.
the
public
not
only
is
protected,
but
it
has
some
sense
of
confidence.
the
contractors
can
be
called
to
account.
but
the
execution
of
contract
is
an
open
book
and
that
the
public
is
not
being
had.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
statute
provides
that
the
contract
should
contain
a
clause
that
in
the
event
that
the
contractor
refuses
to
waive
immunity
with
respect
to
transactions
or
contracts
had
with
the
state,
or
to
answer
relevant
questions
respecting
the
contracts
then
the
economic
consequences
follow.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
correct.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i
do
not
think
that
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
at
the
time
that
he
enters
the
contract,
he
is
under
no
impermissible
coercion
to
take
that
contract.
he’s
after
something.
the
state
is
after
something.
yes,
he
can
at
that
point
to
take
it
or
not
take
it.
but
there’s
no,
this
kind
of
hard
choice
is
not
unknown
and
does
not
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
right.
unless
he’s
--
unless
he’s
going
to
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
either
agrees
that
should
it
become
necessary,
he
will
waive
immunity,
or
he
will
not
for
a
limited
period
of
time
be
able
to
do
business
with
the
state.
ms.
brenda
soloff
where
the
interests
are
so
severe
on
the
part
of
the
public,
where
the
contractor
is
well
enough
informed,
i
am
sorry,
where
the
consequences
are
not
the
devastating
kind
of
consequences
which
occur
to
a
public
employee
then
the
balance,
and
this
is
always
a
question
of
balancing,
shifts
back
toward
the
interest
of
the
public
in
being
able
to
know
what
has
happened
with
its
money.
and
it
being
able
somehow
to
prevent
corruption
to
have
an
extra
tool
in
preventing
corruption
in
cases
where
public
interest
is
so
vitally
concerned.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
concede
a
violation.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i’m
sorry
if
i
even
gave
that
impression.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
balancing
process
which
takes
place
in
determining
whether
or
not,
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
there
was
a
violation;
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
is
what
is
stated
here.
because
the
question
really
is,
are
you
compelling
testimony
by
impermissible
means?
ms.
brenda
soloff
but
the
waiver,
the
validity
of
the
waiver
depends
on
whether
or
not,
it’s
impermissibly
compelled.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
one
way
or
the
other.
there
is
an
allegation
in
a
memorandum
of
law
filed
by
the
appellees
after
the
pleadings
were
filed
but
this
was
not
in
this
particular
contract.
i
have
since
read
the
contract,
the
clause
is
not
in
the
contract.
it
is
not
any
eerie
county
contract.
i
don’t
know
about
other
contracts.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i’m
relying
on
that
as
well
as
the
fact
that
i’ve
never
had
heard
a
claim
in
the
pleadings
that
he
didn’t
know
what
the
consequences
are.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don’t
believe
so.
ms.
brenda
soloff
about
whether
or
not
the
contractor
actually
knew
that
he
was
subject
to
termination
and
disqualification
for
failure
to
waive
immunity.
the
answer
as
far
as
i
can
derive
it
from
the
record
is
he
was
under
no
such
--
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
fact.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
clause
was
not
in
the
contract.
the
complaint
below
attacked
the
contract
clause
statute
and
the
district
court
struck
that
down.
ms.
brenda
soloff
we
don’t
know.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don’t
know
the
chronology
in
gardner,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
we
may
have
here.
there
maybe
some
failure
in
the
pleadings
but
i
think
that,
that
in
common
sense
terms,
we
have
to
assume
it
is
much
more
likely
that
the
contractor
in
this
case
knew
the
ramifications
of
the
law,
then
that
the
policeman
in
gardner
banned
section
1123
of
the
city
charter.
ms.
brenda
soloff
and
also
as
i
said,
the
kind
of
consequence
which
attaches
in
gardner
and
the
kind
of
scope
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
very,
very
different
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
much
different
from
that.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i
wouldn’t,
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
what
we’re
dealing
here
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
because
what
would
bother
me
there
is
the
scope
of
what’s
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
my
reaction
to
that
would
be
that
we
have
to
have
involved
here
a
genuine,
an
ongoing
investigation
into
specific
transaction
and
contracts
being
had
with
the
state.
and
that
should
that
come
to
pass
then
the
contractors
requested
either
to
waive
immunity
or
to
forego
to
cancel
the
special
relationship
that
he
has
with
the
state
for
a
period
of
five
years.
ms.
brenda
soloff
you
can
but
you
choose
at
a
time
when
you
haven’t
committed
materials,
you
have
not
committed
your
firms;
you
haven’t
committed
yourself
to
a
course
of
action
involving
that
contract.
at
the
time
you
make
that
choice,
you
are
still
a
free
agent.
you
haven’t
obligated
yourself
in
anyway.
you
haven’t
gone
out
and
hired
people
to
build
the
stadium.
you
haven’t
brought
in
subcontractors.
you
haven’t
done
a
number
of
things
which
would
increase
perhaps
the
pressure
to
sign
a
waiver.
what
you’ve
done
is
you
said,
“i
really
want
that
contract.
i
will
be
open
and
honest,
there
is
no
problem
whatsoever.
i’ll
sign.”
and
then,
at
the
time
when
the
provision
is
sought
to
be
enforced,
when
there
is
a
real
problem,
you
say
no,
revoke.
and
the
consequence
is
not
specific
enforcement
of
a
waiver
of
immunity
but
the
promise
has
been
broken,
and
the
business
relationship
is
severed,
just
as
the
original
understanding
provided
but
he
did
not
testify
and
he
did
not
waive
immunity.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i’m
sorry,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don’t
know.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
has
broken
the
contract.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i
think
this
i
think
goes
to
different
things
and
is
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
difference
lies
in
the
scope
of
the
public
interest
that
you’re
protecting
here.
you
are
investigating
in
this
situation,
criminal
violations
as
well
as
breach
of
contract.
the
real
crux
of
the
matter
i
think
is
coming
down
to
why
we
would
want
a
waiver
of
immunity,
why
not
grant
immunity,
and
get
the
candor
that
we’re
seeking.
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
it’s
not
really
that
we
are
seeking
to
prosecute
so
much
as
it
--
the
state
when
it
undertakes
an
investigation
like
this
is
not
willing
at
the
outset
to
give
up
the
possibility
of
prosecution
because
not
enough
is
known
about
what
is
involved
in
the
investigation.
immunity
is
not
something
lightly
given
or
easily
given
and
it
should
not
be.
where
here,
you
have
what
i
think
what
the
courts
have
acknowledged
to
be
a
higher
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
contractor
then
on
the
part
of
an
ordinary
citizen.
this
willingness,
this
pre-stated
willingness
to
give
information
without
the
possibility
of
immunity
has
a
part
of
that
higher
obligation.
otherwise,
you
very
much
returned
to
--
if
you
give
immunity
then
you’re
placing
the
contractor
in
the
position
of
the
ordinary
citizen.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
is
basically
corruption
--
problems
involving
corruption,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
our
brief
at
pages,
page
nine
essentially,
there
is
a
statement
by
governor
rockefeller
stating
what
the
legislation
grew
out
of
and
it
was
the
problems
that
grand
juries
were
having
in
getting
information
relating
to
public
contract.
and
the
governor
said,
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
another
statement
in
the
same
volume
which
i
did
not
set
out
in
the
brief
dealing
more
specifically
with
the
fact
that
in
the
leino
case,
the
us
ex
rel
leino
against
wallick
(ph)
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
there’s
a
reference
to
the
memorandum
respecting
the
fact
the
grand
juries
were
having
a
lot
of
trouble
getting
information
about
how
the
contracts
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
in
the
leino
case
as
i
just
said
mr.
justice
stewart
there
is,
i
believe
a
quotation,
a
further
quotation
dealing
with
the
fact
that
that
was
at
issue
is
a
fact
the
grand
jury
simply
have
been
(inaudible)
in
getting
information.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
not
really
--
well,
it
is
not
so
easy
to
call
somebody
before
the
grand
jury
in
new
york,
or
any
place
else,
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
what
happens
if
the
state
of
the
law
of
immunity
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
it
was
forbidden
to
call
a
target
of
an
investigation
or
potential
target
of
an
investigation
before
a
grand
jury.
if
somehow,
without
a
waiver
of
immunity,
if
somehow
he
were
called,
he
received
automatic
use
immunity.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
under
former
new
york
law.
this
is
under
new
york
law
at
the
time
that
this
case
arose.
should
he
testify
and
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
question
by
question
as
new
york
law
then
required.
he
would
receive
transactional
immunity.
that
is,
without
calling,
he
could
not
be
put
into
the
grand
jury
either
without
a
waiver
of
immunity,
or
without
immunity
itself.
today,
the
law
is
somewhat
--
is
somewhat
changed
although
the
impact
is
no
different.
today,
new
york
gives
automatic
transactional
immunity
and
has
abandoned
the
target
rule.
ms.
brenda
soloff
to
any
witness
called
before
the
grand
jury.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
believe
so.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
right.
he
no
longer
needs
to
claim
the
privilege
in
new
york
under
the
new
code
criminal
procedure
law.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
the
waiver,
the
question
--
there
is
a
serious
question
of
the
scope
of
immunity
being
sought
in
this
case.
it
was
not
explored
by
the
district
court.
abstention
was
not
raised
as
an
argument.
but
the
statute,
of
course,
speaks
about
waiving
immunity
with
respect
to
any
transactions
had
with
the
state.
it
would
be
possible
of
course
to
waive
transactional,
the
transactional
immunity
which
would
occur
in
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
or
which
could
under
the
time
this
contract
was
entered
into
could’ve
been
claimed.
it’s
possible
to
waive
transactional
immunity
and
still
obtain
use
immunity,
if
that
is
not
waived.
we
all
know
what
new
york
would
do
with
the
case
like
this
at
this
point.
there’s
in
case
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
called
people
against
avant,
which
has
pending
decision
now
for
sometime.
that’s
cited
in
our
brief.
the
third
department
of
the
state
of
new
york
rejected
a
contractor
claim.
basically,
on
the
sort
of
argument
which
we
are
presenting
today
on
the
public
interest
involved
and
the
fact
that
the
contractor
is
essentially
changing
his
mind.
that
case
is
still
pending
before
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
may
or
it
may
turn
on
this
case
depending
on
which
is
decided
first.
ms.
brenda
soloff
because
the
contractor
does
have
as
i
said
this
higher
obligation
but
corruption
cases
are
very
difficult
to
prove
without
testimony
of
principle.
ms.
brenda
soloff
if
it
comes
to
that,
what
we’re
really
saying
is
we
don’t
know
when
we
question
him.
whether
or
not,
we’re
going
to
want
to
conduct
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
that
we
don’t
to
give
it
away
at
this
stage.
we
don’t
want
to
placed
in
the
position
of
having
granted
immunity
to
a
principle
figure
in
a
very
serious
case.
ms.
brenda
soloff
if
he
waives
immunity.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
the
question
--
the
question
which
i
cannot
answer
because
i
don’t
know
what
the
new
york
court
would
say
and
if
i
may
point
that
one
further
thing
in
connection
with
that
question,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
in
gardner
against
broderick
which
was
reversed
by
this
court
specifically
said,
it
was
post-garrity
case
and
it
specifically
said,
the
waiver
of
immunity
in
this
case,
after
garrity
means
that
the
evidence
cannot
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
this
court
nevertheless
held
that
that
evidence
was
being
sought
for
criminal
prosecution
and
i
really
don’t
know
whether
gardner
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
still
the
law
of
new
york.
ms.
brenda
soloff
but
there
was
also
the
additional
statement.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
very
statute
refers
also
to
heads
of
state
agencies,
heads
of
city
agencies
and
other,
a
number
of
any
agency
which
is
empowered
to
swear
witnesses
and
to
subpoena
and
to
swear
witnesses.
so,
there
are
other
agencies.
they
do
not
give
automatic
transactional
immunity.
they’re
still
under
the
old
procedure.
ms.
brenda
soloff
use
of
immunity
raises
some
of
the
same
problems
of
being
unable
to
prosecute
of
being
--
of
having
the
public
spectacle
of
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
i
am
not.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
statute
is
very
--
is
much
more
carefully
limited
and
any
questions
that
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
contracts
would
not
be
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
correct.
ms.
brenda
soloff
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
ability
of
the
state,
in
this
case
new
york
and
its
subdivisions
here,
eerie
county.
to
provide
themselves
with
some
reliable
assurance
that
in
committing
public
funds
to
independent
contractors,
the
contractors
will
deal
with
them
openly
and
candidly,
when
information
is
sought
about
those
contracts.
two
related
sets
of
new
york
statutes
were
struck
down
by
the
district
court.
the
first,
in
which
new
york
general
municipal
law
section
103
a
is
an
example,
requires
each
public
contract
to
contain
a
provision
that
if
a
person
who
is
called
before
a
grand
jury,
or
other
agency,
which
is
authorized
to
subpoena
and
swear
witnesses.
such
a
person
is
called
to
testify
in
an
investigation
concerning
a
public
contract
and
he
refuses
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
against
subsequent
criminal
prosecution,
or
to
answer
any
relevant
question
concerning
that
contract
or
transaction,
then
that
person
and
any
business
organization
of
which
he
is
a
member
or
officer
shall
be
disqualified
from
public
contracting
for
five
years,
and
existing
contracts
maybe
canceled.
that’s
the
first
set
of
statutes
involved.
the
second
group
statutes
struck
down
below
and
which
new
york
general
municipal
law
section
103
b
is
an
example,
is
directed
at
already
completed
contracts
and
transactions
and
establishes
a
five-year
disqualification
from
future
contracting
for
a
similar
refusal
to
cooperate
under
similar
circumstances.
both
of
these
statutes
and
related
statutes,
which
are
similar
in
other
sections
of
new
york
law,
were
struck
down
by
the
district
court.
the
two
appellees
in
this
case,
are
licensed
architects
and
members
of
a
partnership
which
according
to
the
complaint
had
various
contracts
with
eerie
county.
the
only
one
of
these
contracts
which
is
specifically
mentioned
in
the
complaint,
concerns
the
construction
of
a
domed
stadium
in
eerie
county,
similar
to
the
astrodome
in
houston.
in
answering
the
complaint
in
the
district
court,
the
eerie
county
attorney
admitted
the
existence
of
various
contracts
and
of
the
stadium
contract.
this
is
the
only
information
in
the
record
about
contracts
between
appellees
and
any
publications
in
new
york.
on
february
8,
1971,
while
under
public
contract,
the
two
appellees
and
another
member
of
the
partnership
were
subpoenaed
to
testify
before
an
eerie
county
grand
jury
respecting
transactions
and
contracts
that
they
had
with
the
county.
all
three
were
presented
with
waivers
of
immunity
which
they
were
asked
to
sign.
all
three
refused.
the
third
member
of
the
partnership
then
was
granted
immunity
and
testified.
the
other
two
did
not,
and
did
not
testify.
the
appropriate
authorities
were
informed
of
the
refusals
and
the
instant
action
followed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york,
claiming
that
they
had
in
the
past
and
wished
in
the
future
to
contract
with
the
state
and
its
agencies,
the
appellees
claimed
that
the
statutes
violated
their
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
a
three-judge
district
court,
and
what
must
be
regarded
as
an
over
extension
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
gardner
v.
broderick
and
its
companion
cases
agreed,
and
the
statutes
were
enjoined.
however,
in
seeking
to
protect
the
public
interest,
the
state
has
not
acted
unreasonably
towards
its
contractors.
the
state
and
the
businessman
enter
not
only
into
a
business
arrangement,
but
into
something
of
a
social
contract
as
well.
the
state
begins
with
a
premise,
that
public
money
must
be
well
and
carefully
spent.
neither
cost
nor
quality
must
be
painted
by
graft,
bribery,
the
use
of
inferior
materials,
or
any
other
unseen
impermissible
factor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
right,
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
different
from
the
gardner
case
in
a
number
of
respects.
a
contractor,
when
he
enters
into
a
contract,
understands
at
the
beginning
what
is
expected
of
him.
he
hasn’t
committed
his
life,
his
career,
his
ability
to
earn
a
living
through
this
contract.
he’s
seeking
profit
from
an
episodic
source.
he
knows
at
the
time
that
he
enters
it,
enters
the
contract
that
this
kind
of
information
will
be
required
of
him.
ms.
brenda
soloff
section
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
does
not
appear
in
the
case,
your
honor.
section
1123
of
the
city
charter
is
undoubtedly
a
harder
thing
to
find.
that’s
one
thing
that
can
be
said
about
it.
beyond
that,
contractors
typically
enter
contracts
with
attorneys.
they
have
typically
knowledge,
they
have
the
advice
of
the
counsel
at
the
time
they
enter
contracts.
and
the
contract
itself
is
for
a
limited
span
of
time.
a
policeman
doesn’t
consider
perhaps
every
possible
ramification
of
his
employment
at
the
time
he
takes
that
civil
service
examination,
doesn’t
have
the
advice
of
counsel,
typically.
and
the
section
1123
was
very
different
from
the
statutes
that
we
have
in
this
case.
the
statutes
in
this
case
request
to
information
concerning
any
transaction
or
contract.
section
1123
of
the
city
charter
talks
about
any
kind
of
activity
in
city
government.
it’s
much
broader
than
the
scope
of
the
duties
of
the
policeman.
it
involves
local
elections;
it
involves
any
aspect
of
city
government
which
might
possibly
occur
to
an
investigating
agency.
it
isn’t
limited
to
the
scope
of
the
employment
of
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
either
waives
--
the
agreement
that
he
makes
is
either
to
the
contractors
makes.
i
think
that
there’s
a
much
closer
question
as
to
whether
the
public
employee
makes
such
an
agreement.
the
agreement
he
makes
is
not
to
waive
immunity.
the
agreement
he
makes
is
if
he
does
not
waive
immunity,
then
certain
the
economic
consequences
will
follow.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i.e.,
termination.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
right.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that
is
right.
termination
of
this
particular
contract
is
discretionary
and
disqualification
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
the
consequences
to
a
contractor
are
far
less,
devastating
than
they
are
of
course
to
an
employee.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
is
what
it
comes
down
to,
your
honor.
although,
i
think
the
court
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
reconsideration
of
the
gardner
principle
itself.
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that’s
perfectly
correct.
but
that
the
--
the
consequences
of
what
happens
to
a
contractor
have
to
be
considered
from
the
point
of
view
or
at
the
point
in
time
of
what
he
bargained
for.
what
was
it
that
he
bargained
for
at
the
time
he
went
into
the
contract?
what
was
his
understanding?
i
think
one
thing
that’s
perfectly
clear
is
that
the
interests
of
the
state
are
both
urgent
and
vital.
in
the
public
contractor
and
in
a
public
employee
situation,
it
is
also
clear
that
a
contractor
has
a
higher
obligation
than
the
ordinary
citizen
to
provide
information
with
respect
at
least
to
the
relationship
which
he
has
with
the
state.
if
he’s
unwilling
to
provide
the
information,
then
the
relationship
should
not
continue.
so,
that
the
businessman
understands
when
he
goes
after
a
contract
on
which
he’s
seeking
to
make
a
substantial
amount
of
money.
but
before
that
money,
and
even
perhaps
public
safety
will
be
committed
to
him,
he
must
be
willing
to
accept
certain
preventive
measures
and
to
cooperate
in
any
necessary
detection
of
wrong
doing
doing
because
typically
in
a
situation
involving
contracts,
detection
of
wrong
doing
will
be
difficult.
so
then
he
enters
into
the
special
relationship
with
the
state
and
he
agrees
that
not
withstanding
any
possible
consequences,
should
the
time
come,
he
will
be
open
and
honest.
even
if
it
means
that
the
evidence
will
be
used
against
him
and
that
he
will
be
brought
to
justice.
obviously,
a
principal
benefit
of
this
understanding
is
prevention.
corruption
may
well
be
nipped
in
the
bud.
the
public
not
only
is
protected,
but
it
has
some
sense
of
confidence.
the
contractors
can
be
called
to
account.
but
the
execution
of
contract
is
an
open
book
and
that
the
public
is
not
being
had.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
statute
provides
that
the
contract
should
contain
a
clause
that
in
the
event
that
the
contractor
refuses
to
waive
immunity
with
respect
to
transactions
or
contracts
had
with
the
state,
or
to
answer
relevant
questions
respecting
the
contracts
then
the
economic
consequences
follow.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
correct.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i
do
not
think
that
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
at
the
time
that
he
enters
the
contract,
he
is
under
no
impermissible
coercion
to
take
that
contract.
he’s
after
something.
the
state
is
after
something.
yes,
he
can
at
that
point
to
take
it
or
not
take
it.
but
there’s
no,
this
kind
of
hard
choice
is
not
unknown
and
does
not
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
right.
unless
he’s
--
unless
he’s
going
to
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
either
agrees
that
should
it
become
necessary,
he
will
waive
immunity,
or
he
will
not
for
a
limited
period
of
time
be
able
to
do
business
with
the
state.
ms.
brenda
soloff
where
the
interests
are
so
severe
on
the
part
of
the
public,
where
the
contractor
is
well
enough
informed,
i
am
sorry,
where
the
consequences
are
not
the
devastating
kind
of
consequences
which
occur
to
a
public
employee
then
the
balance,
and
this
is
always
a
question
of
balancing,
shifts
back
toward
the
interest
of
the
public
in
being
able
to
know
what
has
happened
with
its
money.
and
it
being
able
somehow
to
prevent
corruption
to
have
an
extra
tool
in
preventing
corruption
in
cases
where
public
interest
is
so
vitally
concerned.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don't
concede
a
violation.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i’m
sorry
if
i
even
gave
that
impression.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
balancing
process
which
takes
place
in
determining
whether
or
not,
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
--
there
was
a
violation;
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
is
what
is
stated
here.
because
the
question
really
is,
are
you
compelling
testimony
by
impermissible
means?
ms.
brenda
soloff
but
the
waiver,
the
validity
of
the
waiver
depends
on
whether
or
not,
it’s
impermissibly
compelled.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
one
way
or
the
other.
there
is
an
allegation
in
a
memorandum
of
law
filed
by
the
appellees
after
the
pleadings
were
filed
but
this
was
not
in
this
particular
contract.
i
have
since
read
the
contract,
the
clause
is
not
in
the
contract.
it
is
not
any
eerie
county
contract.
i
don’t
know
about
other
contracts.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i’m
relying
on
that
as
well
as
the
fact
that
i’ve
never
had
heard
a
claim
in
the
pleadings
that
he
didn’t
know
what
the
consequences
are.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don’t
believe
so.
ms.
brenda
soloff
about
whether
or
not
the
contractor
actually
knew
that
he
was
subject
to
termination
and
disqualification
for
failure
to
waive
immunity.
the
answer
as
far
as
i
can
derive
it
from
the
record
is
he
was
under
no
such
--
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
fact.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
clause
was
not
in
the
contract.
the
complaint
below
attacked
the
contract
clause
statute
and
the
district
court
struck
that
down.
ms.
brenda
soloff
we
don’t
know.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don’t
know
the
chronology
in
gardner,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
think
that
we
may
have
here.
there
maybe
some
failure
in
the
pleadings
but
i
think
that,
that
in
common
sense
terms,
we
have
to
assume
it
is
much
more
likely
that
the
contractor
in
this
case
knew
the
ramifications
of
the
law,
then
that
the
policeman
in
gardner
banned
section
1123
of
the
city
charter.
ms.
brenda
soloff
and
also
as
i
said,
the
kind
of
consequence
which
attaches
in
gardner
and
the
kind
of
scope
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
very,
very
different
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
much
different
from
that.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i
wouldn’t,
your
honor.
ms.
brenda
soloff
what
we’re
dealing
here
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
because
what
would
bother
me
there
is
the
scope
of
what’s
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
my
reaction
to
that
would
be
that
we
have
to
have
involved
here
a
genuine,
an
ongoing
investigation
into
specific
transaction
and
contracts
being
had
with
the
state.
and
that
should
that
come
to
pass
then
the
contractors
requested
either
to
waive
immunity
or
to
forego
to
cancel
the
special
relationship
that
he
has
with
the
state
for
a
period
of
five
years.
ms.
brenda
soloff
you
can
but
you
choose
at
a
time
when
you
haven’t
committed
materials,
you
have
not
committed
your
firms;
you
haven’t
committed
yourself
to
a
course
of
action
involving
that
contract.
at
the
time
you
make
that
choice,
you
are
still
a
free
agent.
you
haven’t
obligated
yourself
in
anyway.
you
haven’t
gone
out
and
hired
people
to
build
the
stadium.
you
haven’t
brought
in
subcontractors.
you
haven’t
done
a
number
of
things
which
would
increase
perhaps
the
pressure
to
sign
a
waiver.
what
you’ve
done
is
you
said,
“i
really
want
that
contract.
i
will
be
open
and
honest,
there
is
no
problem
whatsoever.
i’ll
sign.”
and
then,
at
the
time
when
the
provision
is
sought
to
be
enforced,
when
there
is
a
real
problem,
you
say
no,
revoke.
and
the
consequence
is
not
specific
enforcement
of
a
waiver
of
immunity
but
the
promise
has
been
broken,
and
the
business
relationship
is
severed,
just
as
the
original
understanding
provided
but
he
did
not
testify
and
he
did
not
waive
immunity.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i’m
sorry,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
don’t
know.
ms.
brenda
soloff
he
has
broken
the
contract.
ms.
brenda
soloff
no,
i
think
this
i
think
goes
to
different
things
and
is
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
difference
lies
in
the
scope
of
the
public
interest
that
you’re
protecting
here.
you
are
investigating
in
this
situation,
criminal
violations
as
well
as
breach
of
contract.
the
real
crux
of
the
matter
i
think
is
coming
down
to
why
we
would
want
a
waiver
of
immunity,
why
not
grant
immunity,
and
get
the
candor
that
we’re
seeking.
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
it’s
not
really
that
we
are
seeking
to
prosecute
so
much
as
it
--
the
state
when
it
undertakes
an
investigation
like
this
is
not
willing
at
the
outset
to
give
up
the
possibility
of
prosecution
because
not
enough
is
known
about
what
is
involved
in
the
investigation.
immunity
is
not
something
lightly
given
or
easily
given
and
it
should
not
be.
where
here,
you
have
what
i
think
what
the
courts
have
acknowledged
to
be
a
higher
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
contractor
then
on
the
part
of
an
ordinary
citizen.
this
willingness,
this
pre-stated
willingness
to
give
information
without
the
possibility
of
immunity
has
a
part
of
that
higher
obligation.
otherwise,
you
very
much
returned
to
--
if
you
give
immunity
then
you’re
placing
the
contractor
in
the
position
of
the
ordinary
citizen.
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
is
basically
corruption
--
problems
involving
corruption,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
our
brief
at
pages,
page
nine
essentially,
there
is
a
statement
by
governor
rockefeller
stating
what
the
legislation
grew
out
of
and
it
was
the
problems
that
grand
juries
were
having
in
getting
information
relating
to
public
contract.
and
the
governor
said,
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
there
is
another
statement
in
the
same
volume
which
i
did
not
set
out
in
the
brief
dealing
more
specifically
with
the
fact
that
in
the
leino
case,
the
us
ex
rel
leino
against
wallick
(ph)
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
there’s
a
reference
to
the
memorandum
respecting
the
fact
the
grand
juries
were
having
a
lot
of
trouble
getting
information
about
how
the
contracts
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
in
the
leino
case
as
i
just
said
mr.
justice
stewart
there
is,
i
believe
a
quotation,
a
further
quotation
dealing
with
the
fact
that
that
was
at
issue
is
a
fact
the
grand
jury
simply
have
been
(inaudible)
in
getting
information.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
not
really
--
well,
it
is
not
so
easy
to
call
somebody
before
the
grand
jury
in
new
york,
or
any
place
else,
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
what
happens
if
the
state
of
the
law
of
immunity
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
it
was
forbidden
to
call
a
target
of
an
investigation
or
potential
target
of
an
investigation
before
a
grand
jury.
if
somehow,
without
a
waiver
of
immunity,
if
somehow
he
were
called,
he
received
automatic
use
immunity.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
is
under
former
new
york
law.
this
is
under
new
york
law
at
the
time
that
this
case
arose.
should
he
testify
and
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
question
by
question
as
new
york
law
then
required.
he
would
receive
transactional
immunity.
that
is,
without
calling,
he
could
not
be
put
into
the
grand
jury
either
without
a
waiver
of
immunity,
or
without
immunity
itself.
today,
the
law
is
somewhat
--
is
somewhat
changed
although
the
impact
is
no
different.
today,
new
york
gives
automatic
transactional
immunity
and
has
abandoned
the
target
rule.
ms.
brenda
soloff
to
any
witness
called
before
the
grand
jury.
ms.
brenda
soloff
i
believe
so.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
right.
he
no
longer
needs
to
claim
the
privilege
in
new
york
under
the
new
code
criminal
procedure
law.
ms.
brenda
soloff
well,
the
waiver,
the
question
--
there
is
a
serious
question
of
the
scope
of
immunity
being
sought
in
this
case.
it
was
not
explored
by
the
district
court.
abstention
was
not
raised
as
an
argument.
but
the
statute,
of
course,
speaks
about
waiving
immunity
with
respect
to
any
transactions
had
with
the
state.
it
would
be
possible
of
course
to
waive
transactional,
the
transactional
immunity
which
would
occur
in
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
or
which
could
under
the
time
this
contract
was
entered
into
could’ve
been
claimed.
it’s
possible
to
waive
transactional
immunity
and
still
obtain
use
immunity,
if
that
is
not
waived.
we
all
know
what
new
york
would
do
with
the
case
like
this
at
this
point.
there’s
in
case
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
called
people
against
avant,
which
has
pending
decision
now
for
sometime.
that’s
cited
in
our
brief.
the
third
department
of
the
state
of
new
york
rejected
a
contractor
claim.
basically,
on
the
sort
of
argument
which
we
are
presenting
today
on
the
public
interest
involved
and
the
fact
that
the
contractor
is
essentially
changing
his
mind.
that
case
is
still
pending
before
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
ms.
brenda
soloff
it
may
or
it
may
turn
on
this
case
depending
on
which
is
decided
first.
ms.
brenda
soloff
because
the
contractor
does
have
as
i
said
this
higher
obligation
but
corruption
cases
are
very
difficult
to
prove
without
testimony
of
principle.
ms.
brenda
soloff
if
it
comes
to
that,
what
we’re
really
saying
is
we
don’t
know
when
we
question
him.
whether
or
not,
we’re
going
to
want
to
conduct
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
that
we
don’t
to
give
it
away
at
this
stage.
we
don’t
want
to
placed
in
the
position
of
having
granted
immunity
to
a
principle
figure
in
a
very
serious
case.
ms.
brenda
soloff
if
he
waives
immunity.
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
the
question
--
the
question
which
i
cannot
answer
because
i
don’t
know
what
the
new
york
court
would
say
and
if
i
may
point
that
one
further
thing
in
connection
with
that
question,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
in
gardner
against
broderick
which
was
reversed
by
this
court
specifically
said,
it
was
post-garrity
case
and
it
specifically
said,
the
waiver
of
immunity
in
this
case,
after
garrity
means
that
the
evidence
cannot
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
this
court
nevertheless
held
that
that
evidence
was
being
sought
for
criminal
prosecution
and
i
really
don’t
know
whether
gardner
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
still
the
law
of
new
york.
ms.
brenda
soloff
but
there
was
also
the
additional
statement.
ms.
brenda
soloff
this
very
statute
refers
also
to
heads
of
state
agencies,
heads
of
city
agencies
and
other,
a
number
of
any
agency
which
is
empowered
to
swear
witnesses
and
to
subpoena
and
to
swear
witnesses.
so,
there
are
other
agencies.
they
do
not
give
automatic
transactional
immunity.
they’re
still
under
the
old
procedure.
ms.
brenda
soloff
use
of
immunity
raises
some
of
the
same
problems
of
being
unable
to
prosecute
of
being
--
of
having
the
public
spectacle
of
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
yes,
i
am
not.
ms.
brenda
soloff
the
statute
is
very
--
is
much
more
carefully
limited
and
any
questions
that
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
contracts
would
not
be
--
ms.
brenda
soloff
that’s
correct.
