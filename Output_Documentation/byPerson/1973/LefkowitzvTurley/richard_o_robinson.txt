mr.
richard
o.
robinson
your
honor,
i
cannot
find
any
distinction.
in
fact,
if
anything,
i
think
in
the
gardner
case,
the
statute
in
the
proceeding
which
was
involved
was
more
restrictive
and
more
related
to
the
specific
employment
of
the
police
officer.
now,
that
section
1123
stated
at
that
time
if
any
counsel
man
or
other
officer
or
employee
the
city
shall
after
lawful
notice
in
presses,
willfully
refuse
to
appear
before
any
court
or
judge
or
any
legislative
committee
or
body
authorized
to
conduct
such
hearing
or
inquiry
or
having
appeared
shall
refuse
to
testify
or
answer
any
questions
regarding
the
property,
government,
or
affairs
of
the
city
or
of
any
county
included
within
its
territorial
limits.
so
that
in
gardner,
the
law
was
even
more
restrictive
and
more
limited
than
it
is
under
section
103
a
b,
sections
of
the
general
municipal
law,
sections
26.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
we
had
no
argument
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
i
assume
that
to
be
the
gist
of
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
decision.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
yes,
and
as
i
started
to
say
i
assume
that
to
be
the
gist
of
a
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
gardner
case.
they
had
dissented
in
the
spevack
and
the
garrity
cases
and
then
--
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
they
seized
on
it
and
may
have
in
effect
overrule
spevack
in
process.
but
the
court
also
states
that
there
was
not
necessarily
any
criminal
proceeding.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
this
particular
case,
a
grand
jury
had
been
in
the
panel
and
the
two
architects
here
were
presented
with
the
waivers
of
immunity
which
stated
that
i
have
been
advised
by
district
attorney
john
j.
honan
at
the
grand
jury
of
the
county
of
eerie
now
in
sessions
investigating
charges
of
conspiracy,
bribery,
larceny,
and
other
matters
of
every
nature
whatsoever
appertaining
thereto.
i
am
further
advised
that
such
charge
and
investigation
may
involve
me
so
that
they
were
directly
--
they
are
made
targets
of
the
investigation.
i
should
like
to
point
out
from
in
regards
to
the
previous
remarks
made
in
the
argument
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
at
the
time
of
these
proceedings
was
stated
and
people
versus
steuding,
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
s-t-e-u-d-i-n-g,
at
six
new
york
2nd
214.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
by
virtue
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york,
a
perspective
the
defendant
or
one
who
was
a
target
of
an
investigation
might
not
be
called
or
examined
before
a
grand
jury.
and
if
he
was,
he
is
constitutionally
conferred
privilege
against
self
incrimination
was
deemed
to
violate
it
even
though
he
did
not
claim
or
assert
the
privilege.
now,
that
was
incorporated
in
article
50
of
the
criminal
procedure
law.
so,
at
the
time
that
this
proceeding
arose,
the
targets,
the
architects,
the
police
here
were
presented
with
a
waiver,
directed
him
to
give
up
all
constitutional
rights
which
is
ahead
of
the
time
and
compelling
them,
tempting
the
appellant
to
testify
against
themselves
obviously
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
well
first
of
all,
there
was
no
such
provision
in
the
contract.
the
state
statutes
say
that
--
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
i’m
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
i
think,
we
have
to
assume
he
did.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
first
of
all
your
honor,
he
makes
no
such
agreement.
there
was
no
such
agreement.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
he
did
but
the
statutory
state
--
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
the
state
law
says
that
every
contract
shall
contain
such
a
provision.
it
does
not
state
that
every
contract
shall
be
deemed
to
contain
such
a
provision
whether
or
not
it
is
written
into
it.
there’s
nothing
in
any
of
the
briefs
or
arguments
here
--
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
assuming
that
to
be
true,
i
think
we
have
to
fall
back
on
the
loyalty
oath
cases,
as
farkova
(ph)
case
to
the
effect
that
the
state
cannot
require
a
public
employee
to
waive
his
constitutional
right
as
a
condition
of
public
employment.
my
argument
here
and
the
argument
of
the
--
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
yes,
the
argument
of
the
appellees
--
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
the
argument
of
the
appellees
is
that
this
statute
is
overbroad.
we
don’t
argue
that
the
government
might
have
less
rights
than
any
ordinary
employer
to
inquire
into
the
conditions
of
the
contract,
to
inquire
into
relevant
matters
concerning
the
contract.
what
we
argue
here
is
that
this
goes
well
beyond
that
and
in
effect
permits
the
government
to
employ
its
full
powers
of
subpoena,
and
repression
to
inquire
into
matters
not
necessarily
related
to
the
contract.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
it’s
usually
asserted
in
the
first
amendment
area.
however,
i
think
in
the
last
term
in
the
case
of
brooks
versus
tennessee,
it
was
asserted.
i
believe
that
was
under
the
--
that
was
in
the
fifth
amendment
area.
i
believe
that
was
an
over
breadth
case.
i
believe
also
that
the
city’s
recent
decision
concerning
the
rights
of
aliens
to
public
employment
would
be
in
the
over
breadth
area.
that
is
there
has
to
be
some
reasonable
relationship
of
a
limiting
statute,
a
government
statute,
a
limiting
constitutional
rights.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
well,
i
would
see
a
problem
with
it
but
i
do
not
believe
it’s
an
issue
in
this
case.
simply,
it’s
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
was
very
clearly
stated
by
the
lower
court
and
that
the
statute
goes
well
beyond
limiting
the
limitations
under
constitutional
right
to
narrowly
confined
areas
concerning
employment.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
that’s
absolutely
correct.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
our
position.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
that’s
absolutely
correct.
and
i
believe
that,
that
is
the
gist
of
the
gardner
and
uniform
sanitations
in
all
these
cases
that
the
statutes
went
above
and
beyond
narrowly
confined
limitations
relating
to
the
employment.
the
only
other
issue
presented
--
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
your
honor,
i
cannot
distinguish
between
a
prior
restriction
and
a
restriction
imposed
subsequent
to
the
commencement
of
a
contract.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
yes.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
yes.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
the
only
other
point
raised
was
the
quantitative
and
qualitative
or
as
to
whether
the
thread
of
loss
of
contract,
contracting
privileges
by
a
public
contractor
is
somehow
less
of
a
penalty
than
a
direct
employee
of
the
government.
all
i
can
say
is
in
that,
and
that
is
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
i
can
see
no
qualitative
or
quantitative
difference
between
the
firing
of
a
laborer
on
a
garbage
truck
who
can
go
out
and
secure
other
laboring
employment
in
the
public
sector,
and
termination
of
a
contractor
or
an
architect’s
contract
and
restriction
upon
him
for
five
years
in
future
contracting.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
richard
o.
robinson
your
honor,
i
cannot
find
any
distinction.
in

if
anything,
i
think

the

which
was

so
that
