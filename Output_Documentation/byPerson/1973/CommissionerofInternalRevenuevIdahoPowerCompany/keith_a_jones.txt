mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
a
question
of
business
income
taxation
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
the
respondent
taxpayer,
the
idaho
power
company
is
a
public
utility
engaged
in
the
production,
transmission
and
distribution
of
electric
energy.
in
connection
with
this
business,
the
respondent
performs
a
substantial
proportion
of
its
own
--
substantial
portion
of
its
construction
work.
in
the
years
1962
and
1963,
the
tax
full
years
in
question
in
this
case.
the
respondent
itself
constructed
approximately
$13,000,000.00
in
new
capital
facilities
primarily
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice
blackmun.
in
performing
this
construction
work,
the
respondent
uses
essentially
two
different
types
of
construction
equipment.
uses
automotive
transportation
equipment
such
as
passenger
cars,
pickup
trucks,
heavier
trucks
and
trailers
and
also
what
is
called
power
operated
equipment,
which
means
primarily
cranes,
tractors,
bulldozers,
road
graters
and
so
forth.
the
depreciation
of
this
construction
equipment,
well
in
this
case
be
referred
to
as
construction
--
excuse
me
construction
related
depreciation.
now
by
construction
related
depreciation,
we
do
not
mean
all
depreciation
on
construction
equipment
but
we
refer
to
in
this
case
as
the
depreciation
on
construction
equipment
used
by
taxpayer
in
the
construction
of
its
own
capital
facilities.
in
performing
construction
work,
the
respondent
encourage
a
wide
variety
of
construction
cost.
it
pays
wages
to
construction
workers,
it
buys
tools
and
materials
which
are
used
up
in
the
course
of
construction,
and
it
also
incurs
wear
and
tear
or
exhaustion
of
the
construction
equipment
itself
that
is
the
construction
related
depreciation.
on
its
general
looks
of
account,
the
respondent
capitalizes
all
of
this
construction
cost.
it
does
this
in
compliance
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
which
recognize
that
this
construction
cost
including
construction
related
depreciation
constitute
capital
outlays
and
not
operating
expenses.
this
fact
is
also
recognized
by
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
idaho
public
utilities
commission,
both
of
which
require
the
respondent
to
capitalize
its
construction
related
depreciation
and
for
regulatory
purposes.
however,
on
its
tax
returns,
the
respondent
treats
these
matters
somewhat
differently.
it
capitalizes
most
of
its
construction
cost.
for
example,
it
capitalizes
the
wages
paid
to
the
operators
of
the
construction
equipment,
does
not
deduct
those
wages
as
an
ordinary
unnecessary
cost
of
doing
business.
it
also
capitalizes
the
cost
of
fuel
used
by
the
construction
equipment
and
it
capitalizes
the
cost
of
repairs
to
that
equipment
but
it
does
not
capitalize
the
depreciation
itself.
it
seeks
in
this
case
to
take
that
depreciation
as
an
immediate
deduction
against
current
income.
the
commissioner
disallowed
this
depreciation
deduction
for
the
years
in
question
and
the
tax
court
sustained
that
disallowance
on
the
ground
that
section
263
of
the
code
requires
the
capitalization
of
all
capital
cost
including
construction
related
depreciation.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
a
surprise,
came
as
a
surprise
to
many
tax
practitioners.
internal
revenue
service
has
for
many
years
taken
the
position
in
formal
rulings
that
construction
related
depreciation
must
be
capitalized
and
it
is
not
deductible.
in
this
position
of
the
commissioner
has
been
upheld
in
a
long
series
of
decisions
in
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
claims.
because
of
this
long
history,
almost
all
taxpayers
who
are
engaged
in
the
self
construction
of
their
capital
facilities
have
complied
with
the
services
rulings
and
have
capitalized
their
construction
related
depreciation.
this
long
acceptance
of
the
commissioner’s
position
makes
the
immediate
revenue
impact
of
this
case
quite
substantial.
most
railroads
and
utility
companies
and
many
large
industrial
corporations
as
well
perform
their
own
construction
work,
and
as
i
have
said,
these
taxpayers
have
in
the
past
capitalized
this
depreciation
either.
but
if
the
decision
below
were
left
standing,
it
was
anticipated
that
most
of
this
taxpayers
would
file
claims
for
refund
on
the
basis
of
that
decision
and
the
rnternal
revenue
service
estimated
that
this
refund
claims
would
amount
to
over
$100
million
for
each
of
the
tax
full
years
currently
open.
and
it
was
in
large
part
to
forestall
the
litigation
which
would
arise
from
the
filing
of
those
refund
claims
that
the
government
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
i
turn
now
to
a
discussion
of
the
merits.
it
should
first
be
pointed
out
that
the
deduction
which
the
respondent
seeks
in
this
case
would
result
in
a
distortion
in
the
reporting
of
its
net
income.
construction
related
depreciation
is
not
an
operating
expense,
it
is
a
capital
cost
associated
with
the
production
of
income
only
in
the
future,
not
with
the
production
of
income
in
the
present.
the
cause
of
that,
the
deduction
of
this
depreciation,
we
tend
to
understate
current
net
income
and
it
would
postpone
or
defer
the
recognition
of
income
which
the
respondent
has
already
earned.
in
other
words,
what
the
respondent
is
claiming
in
this
case
is
the
right
to
take
an
immediate
deduction
which
is
not
sanctioned
by
normal
accounting
rules
which
would
have
the
effect
of
postponing
the
recognition
of
income
until
future
years.
this
court
has
never
permitted
such
deductions
of
amounts
which
were
not
sanctioned
by
normal
accounting
rules
which
would
have
the
effect
of
so
postponing
the
recognition
of
income
except
whereas
such
a
deduction
is
clearly
allowed
by
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute
and
it
is
our
position
here
as
i
will
now
go
on
to
discuss.
statute
does
not
permit
the
deduction
of
that
item
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
by
normal
accounting
practice
we
mean
the
general
accepting
accounting
rule
that
this
kind
of
capital
cost
must
be
capitalized.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we
sited
a
couple
of
accounting
text
in
our
brief
and
we
also
sited
the
rules
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
they
were
kept
on
the
basis
which
we
urge.
in
other
words,
they
capitalize
the
construction
related
depreciation.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
scc’s
rules
that
may
but
i
can
answer
that
question.
however,
the
federal
power
commission
which
regulates
this
company
does
have
a
rule
which
requires
capitalization
and
the
idaho
public
utilities
commission
also
a
regulatory
agency
that
which
respondent
to
subject
also
requires
capitalization.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
there
is
nothing
about
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
are
not
relying
upon
any
constitutional
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
certainly
no
deduction.
certainly
where
the
section
167
which
governs
depreciation
generally
would
not
permit
a
deduction,
the
tax
payer
could
not
take
such
deduction
merely
because
he
took
it
on
his
general
books
of
account.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
he
only
took
it
on
his
tax
returns
in
this
case.
taxpayer
here
did
not
take
the
deduction
on
its
general
books
of
account.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
turn
know
to
an
analysis
of
the
statute
which
must
begin
with
section
263,
that
section
provides
and
i
shall
quote
“no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
or
for
permanent
improvements
or
betterments
made
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
a
state.”
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
a
technical
provision
to
be
read
narrowly.
to
the
contrary,
this
court
has
historically
read
it
broadly
as
the
legislative
expression
of
the
accounting
principle
of
capitalization.
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
the
course
of
holding
such
diverse
items
is
brokeridge
commission,
stock
appraisal
litigation
cause
and
supplementary
savings
in
loan
insurance,
premiums
to
be
capital.
that
section
263
stands
for
the
broad
requirement
that
capital
items
must
be
capitalized.
they
are
of
course
statutory
exceptions
to
this
broad
requirement.
section
263
itself
contain
several
such
exceptions.
also
section
266
provides
an
exception
for
taxes
and
caring
cause.
but
there
is
no
similar
exception
for
depreciation.
there
is
nothing
in
the
code
which
would
accept
depreciation
in
the
requirements
of
section
263.
there
is
to
be
sure
provision
for
the
deduction
of
depreciation.
that
is
allowed
in
section
167.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
section
161
of
the
code
expressly
makes
all
business
deductions
including
the
deduction
for
depreciation
under
section
167
subordinate
to
the
capitalization
requirement
of
section
263.
in
other
words,
if
this
construction
related
depreciation
falls
within
the
general
terms
of
section
263
that
it
must
be
capitalized
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
it
might
otherwise
be
deducted
under
section
167.
we
believe
that
to
view
the
matter
in
this
slight
is
practically
to
answer
the
question
presented.
because
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case,
the
construction
related
depreciation
is
a
capital
item.
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case,
the
construction
related
depreciation
is
a
cost
of
construction
and
the
regulations
under
section
263
have
historically
acquired
the
capitalization
of
all
cost
of
construction.
moreover,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
regulations
under
section
48
expressly
state
the
requirement
that
construction
related
depreciation
must
be
capitalized
that
it
is
not
subject
to
immediate
deduction.
the
respondent
therefore
is
essentially
in
the
position
of
contending
that
the
secretary’s
regulations
misconstrued
the
statute.
but
in
making
this
contention,
the
respondents
following
far
short
we
believe
of
carrying
the
burden
or
showing
that
the
secretary’s
regulations
are
unreasonable.
the
only
statutory
argument
which
the
respondent
makes
in
this
case
is
the
depreciation
does
not
“an
amount
paid
out”
within
the
meaning
of
section
263.
on
the
first
place,
we
believe
that
this
argument
overlooks
the
fact
that
this
court
held
in
lincoln
savings
and
loan
that
capital
items
must
be
capitalized
whether
or
not
they
might
fall
within
a
strict
reading
of
the
literal
language
of
section
263.
we
need
not
reach
so
far
in
this
case
because
we
believe
it’s
clear
that
construction
related
depreciation
is
an
amount
paid
out
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
secretary
has
construed
that
statutory
phrase,
amount
paid
out
to
mean
as
being
synonymous
with
cost
incurred.
and
that
is
really
the
only
construction
in
the
statute
that
makes
any
sense.
that
is
the
only
construction
in
the
statute
which
harmonizes
the
fundamental
assumptions
of
the
income
tax
system.
congress
could
have
not
required
the
capitalization
only
of
actual
payments,
could
not
have
intended
that
only
actual
payments
be
subject
to
capitalization.
historically,
items
such
the
issuance
of
stock,
assumption
of
liabilities,
the
using
up
of
construction
materials,
the
exchange
of
property
for
other
property
has
given
rise
to
capitalization
has
not
been
immediately
deductible
even
though
there
is
no
actual
payment
that
is
taking
place
at
the
time
that
the
capital
asset
is
acquired.
what
is
important
under
the
statutory
scheme
is
simply
that
when
a
capital
asset
is
acquired,
there
will
be
some
cost
incurred,
liability
assumed
rather
responsibility
undertaken
which
properly
is
a
capital
item.
and
in
this
case,
the
respondent
by
using
out
its
construction
equipment
by
physically
exhausting
that
equipment
has
incurred
a
very
real
cost
in
the
coarse
of
acquiring
a
capital
asset,
and
that
cost
which
is
incurred
gives
rise
to
the
capitalization
requirement
here.
but
even
if
the
statute
were
read
literally
as
requiring
actual
payment,
it
nevertheless
does
not
require
that
payment
to
be
made
during
the
taxable
year
in
question.
thus,
when
the
respondent
pays
or
incurs
wage
expenses
in
the
course
of
constructing
capital
facilities
and
those
wages
aren’t
paid
out
until
the
following
year.
nevertheless,
there
is
a
capital
item
in
the
first
year,
there
is
no
actual
payment,
payment
is
made
in
the
following
year
but
it
is
the
accrual
of
the
wages
in
the
first
year
which
gives
rise
to
a
capital
item
but
perhaps
more
to
the
point
in
this
case.
if
the
respondent
purchases
construction
materials
in
one
year
and
then
uses
up
those
construction
materials
in
the
two
following
years,
when
those
construction
materials
are
used
up,
that
is
a
capital
item
which
has
to
be
capitalized
as
part
of
the
basis
of
the
capital
facilities
which
are
being
constructed.
and
depreciation
really
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
consumption
of
these
construction
materials.
the
payment
is
made
in
the
first
year
when
construction
equipment
is
acquired.
but
as
the
construction
equipment
is
used
up,
depreciated,
there
gives
rise
to
the
capital
item
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
they
using
up
of
construction
materials
in
subsequent
years
thus.
in
each
case,
you
have
a
payment
in
an
earlier
year,
but
the
using
up
of
the
asset
which
you
have
already
paid
for
in
the
course
of
constructing
your
new
capital
facilities
and
all
of
this
physical
exhaustion
or
usage
of
materials
as
part
of
the
cost
of
construction
represents
an
amount
paid
out
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
as
a
capital
item.
we
feel
that
this
conclusion
is
supported
by
other
provisions
of
the
code.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
sited
sections
174,
182,
615,
616
and
617.
all
of
these
provisions
permit
a
taxpayer
to
deduct
items
which
would
otherwise
have
to
be
capitalized.
and
each
of
these
provisions
does
permit
the
deduction
of
construction
related
depreciation
in
very
limited
circumstances.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
by
providing
for
the
deduction
of
this
kind
of
depreciation
in
those
limited
circumstances
express
this
in
--
in
the
first
place
it
expresses
awareness
as
such
depreciation
would
otherwise
be
capital
item
not
subject
to
deduction.
and
secondly,
it
indicated
its
intention
that
in
all
other
circumstances
not
covered
by
those
provisions,
this
depreciation
would
still
be
subject
to
capitalization
and
would
not
be
a
deductible
item.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
all
we
are
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
achieve
a
tax
parity
between
this
taxpayer
and
all
other
taxpayers
who
acquire
capital
facilities.
and
i
think
that
can
be
seen
to
the
following
examples.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
will
give
you
several
examples
mr.
justice
stewart,
some
of
the
taxpayers
who
do
and
some
who
do
not.
for
example,
if
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
rented
this
construction
equipment
instead
of
purchasing
it
and
use
rented
equipment
in
constructing
its
own
facilities,
those
rental
payments
would
all
be
capital,
none
of
them
could
be
deducted
immediately
and
all
be
part
of
the
new
capital
basis
of
the
new
facilities.
similarly,
if
this
respondent
form
the
subsidiary
corporation
to
construct
the
assets
that
kept
new
facilities.
although
that
subsidiary
corporation
would
be
entitled
to
a
depreciation
deduction,
under
section
482
of
the
code.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct
but
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
under
section
482
of
the
code,
the
parent
corporation
would
be
required
to
pay
the
subsidiary
enough
to
offset
that
depreciation
so
that
the
deduction
would
not
give
the
subsidiary
any
advantage,
it
would
simply
be
a
wash
and
the
payment
made
by
the
parent
to
cover
that
depreciation
would
be
a
capital
item,
would
not
be
deductible
to
the
parent
because
it
will
be
part
of
the
cost,
the
parent
expanded
and
bind
the
new
capital
facilities
from
the
subsidiary.
and
that
of
course
where
an
outside
independent
contractors
hired
to
do
the
work,
all
the
payments
to
that
contractor
including
amounts
necessary
to
cover
depreciation
on
the
contractors
equipment
would
be
capital,
they
will
not
be
deductible.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
right,
and
that
points
out
the
underlying
thesis
of
our
position
where
depreciation
is
incurred
for
the
production
of
immediate
income,
then
it
is
an
expense
of
operations
which
is
properly
deductible.
when
it
is
incurred
however,
not
for
the
--
not
in
the
course
of
an
ongoing
business
to
produce
immediate
income
but
to
acquire
a
new
capital
asset
which
is
only
going
to
be
used
for
the
production
of
income
in
the
future,
then
it
is
a
capital
item.
for
these
reasons,
we
asked
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
really
have
very
little
to
offer
but
something
that
closing
counsel
said
cast
mr.
justice
powell’s
question
somewhat
different
like
for
me
and
i
did
want
to
respond
to
that.
we
are
not
taking
the
position
in
this
case
that
financial
accounting
is
necessarily
the
guide
to
the
interpretation
of
the
tax
code
but
we’re
saying
is
that
when
taxpayers
claiming
a
deduction
which
is
not
even
permitted
by
financial
accounting,
then
he
really
ought
to
show
very
explicitly,
very
clearly
statutory
language
which
permits
that
deductions
and
its
our
position
here
that
no
such
statutory
language
has
been
shown
but
to
the
contrary,
we
pointed
out
in
section
263
explicitly
bars
the
deduction
here
that
is
necessary
impact
of
sections
161
which
makes
the
deduction
for
depreciation
subject
to
the
capitalization
provision.
there
are
a
number
of
small
points
in
case
which
has
been
argued
and
i
think
they’re
all
properly
answered
in
our
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
won’t
go
into
them
at
length
here
with
one
exception
which
is
the
taxpayers
argument
that
there
is
something
about
the
cases
under
sections
170
and
213
pertaining
to
the
medical
expense
deduction,
charitable
contribution
deduction
which
is
favorable
to
him
here.
well,
those
provisions
provide
for
deductions
of
amounts
paid
during
the
taxable
year
and
the
courts
have
construed
depreciation
is
not
being
an
amount
paid
out
during
the
taxable
year
for
purposes
of
those
deduction
provisions
but
statute
were
reliant
on
section
263
does
not
require
payment
during
the
taxable
year
merely
requires
an
amount
paid
out
at
sometimes.
as
we
have
shown,
there
has
been
an
amount
paid
out
here
and
it
is
represented
by
depreciation.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
history
of
estate
and
local
taxes
and
other
caring
charges
such
as
interest
is
a
long
one.
the
courts
in
the
--
i
think
20’s
and
30’s
perhaps
the
30’s
were
holding
that
those
expenses
were
not
capital
items
because
they
did
not
improve
the
value
of
the
taxpayers
property.
the
courts
held
it,
those
payments
of
taxes
and
interest
were
merely
incurred
to
retain
ownership
of
the
property
and
for
that
reason
were
not
capital.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right
and
i
think
that
the
holding
that
those
items
were
not
capital
is
subject
to
some
question.
but
in
our
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
depreciation
on
the
construction
equipment
was
incurred
in
the
course
of
improving
the
property
and
the
course
of
creating
a
new
capital
asset
and
that
is
clearly
capital
and
the
earlier
lower
court
decisions
holding
that
interesting
taxes
weren’t
properly
capital
which
is
really
a
holding
on
economic
grounds
whether
on
legal
grounds
i
think
really
aren’t
in
point
here.
nor
i
as
i
say
the
case
is
with
respect
to
the
medical
contributions
and
the
medical
deductions
and
the
charitable
contributions,
the
purpose
of
those
deduction
provisions
is
to
allow
a
deduction,
to
allow
some
tax
relief
when
a
taxpayer
incurs
an
expense
which
she
wouldn’t
otherwise
have
to
incur
and
all
the
cases
which
the
respondent
sites
involves
the
occasional
use
of
an
automobile
or
of
an
airplane,
an
automobile
or
an
airplane
which
would
have
been
depreciated
anyway.
there
was
no
reason
in
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
provide
a
deduction
or
to
permit
a
deduction
that
depreciation
which
would
have
been
incurred
anyway
and
therefore
i
think
the
courts
properly
held
that
it
was
not
deductible
under
those
provisions.
again,
those
decisions
it
seems
to
us
has
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
a
question
of
business
income
taxation
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
the
respondent
taxpayer,
the
idaho
power
company
is
a
public
utility
engaged
in
the
production,
transmission
and
distribution
of
electric
energy.
in
connection
with
this
business,
the
respondent
performs
a
substantial
proportion
of
its
own
--
substantial
portion
of
its
construction
work.
in
the
years
1962
and
1963,
the
tax
full
years
in
question
in
this
case.
the
respondent
itself
constructed
approximately
$13,000,000.00
in
new
capital
facilities
primarily
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice
blackmun.
in
performing
this
construction
work,
the
respondent
uses
essentially
two
different
types
of
construction
equipment.
uses
automotive
transportation
equipment
such
as
passenger
cars,
pickup
trucks,
heavier
trucks
and
trailers
and
also
what
is
called
power
operated
equipment,
which
means
primarily
cranes,
tractors,
bulldozers,
road
graters
and
so
forth.
the
depreciation
of
this
construction
equipment,
well
in
this
case
be
referred
to
as
construction
--
excuse
me
construction
related
depreciation.
now
by
construction
related
depreciation,
we
do
not
mean
all
depreciation
on
construction
equipment
but
we
refer
to
in
this
case
as
the
depreciation
on
construction
equipment
used
by
taxpayer
in
the
construction
of
its
own
capital
facilities.
in
performing
construction
work,
the
respondent
encourage
a
wide
variety
of
construction
cost.
it
pays
wages
to
construction
workers,
it
buys
tools
and
materials
which
are
used
up
in
the
course
of
construction,
and
it
also
incurs
wear
and
tear
or
exhaustion
of
the
construction
equipment
itself
that
is
the
construction
related
depreciation.
on
its
general
looks
of
account,
the
respondent
capitalizes
all
of
this
construction
cost.
it
does
this
in
compliance
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
which
recognize
that
this
construction
cost
including
construction
related
depreciation
constitute
capital
outlays
and
not
operating
expenses.
this
fact
is
also
recognized
by
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
idaho
public
utilities
commission,
both
of
which
require
the
respondent
to
capitalize
its
construction
related
depreciation
and
for
regulatory
purposes.
however,
on
its
tax
returns,
the
respondent
treats
these
matters
somewhat
differently.
it
capitalizes
most
of
its
construction
cost.
for
example,
it
capitalizes
the
wages
paid
to
the
operators
of
the
construction
equipment,
does
not
deduct
those
wages
as
an
ordinary
unnecessary
cost
of
doing
business.
it
also
capitalizes
the
cost
of
fuel
used
by
the
construction
equipment
and
it
capitalizes
the
cost
of
repairs
to
that
equipment
but
it
does
not
capitalize
the
depreciation
itself.
it
seeks
in
this
case
to
take
that
depreciation
as
an
immediate
deduction
against
current
income.
the
commissioner
disallowed
this
depreciation
deduction
for
the
years
in
question
and
the
tax
court
sustained
that
disallowance
on
the
ground
that
section
263
of
the
code
requires
the
capitalization
of
all
capital
cost
including
construction
related
depreciation.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
a
surprise,
came
as
a
surprise
to
many
tax
practitioners.
internal
revenue
service
has
for
many
years
taken
the
position
in
formal
rulings
that
construction
related
depreciation
must
be
capitalized
and
it
is
not
deductible.
in
this
position
of
the
commissioner
has
been
upheld
in
a
long
series
of
decisions
in
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
claims.
because
of
this
long
history,
almost
all
taxpayers
who
are
engaged
in
the
self
construction
of
their
capital
facilities
have
complied
with
the
services
rulings
and
have
capitalized
their
construction
related
depreciation.
this
long
acceptance
of
the
commissioner’s
position
makes
the
immediate
revenue
impact
of
this
case
quite
substantial.
most
railroads
and
utility
companies
and
many
large
industrial
corporations
as
well
perform
their
own
construction
work,
and
as
i
have
said,
these
taxpayers
have
in
the
past
capitalized
this
depreciation
either.
but
if
the
decision
below
were
left
standing,
it
was
anticipated
that
most
of
this
taxpayers
would
file
claims
for
refund
on
the
basis
of
that
decision
and
the
rnternal
revenue
service
estimated
that
this
refund
claims
would
amount
to
over
$100
million
for
each
of
the
tax
full
years
currently
open.
and
it
was
in
large
part
to
forestall
the
litigation
which
would
arise
from
the
filing
of
those
refund
claims
that
the
government
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
i
turn
now
to
a
discussion
of
the
merits.
it
should
first
be
pointed
out
that
the
deduction
which
the
respondent
seeks
in
this
case
would
result
in
a
distortion
in
the
reporting
of
its
net
income.
construction
related
depreciation
is
not
an
operating
expense,
it
is
a
capital
cost
associated
with
the
production
of
income
only
in
the
future,
not
with
the
production
of
income
in
the
present.
the
cause
of
that,
the
deduction
of
this
depreciation,
we
tend
to
understate
current
net
income
and
it
would
postpone
or
defer
the
recognition
of
income
which
the
respondent
has
already
earned.
in
other
words,
what
the
respondent
is
claiming
in
this
case
is
the
right
to
take
an
immediate
deduction
which
is
not
sanctioned
by
normal
accounting
rules
which
would
have
the
effect
of
postponing
the
recognition
of
income
until
future
years.
this
court
has
never
permitted
such
deductions
of
amounts
which
were
not
sanctioned
by
normal
accounting
rules
which
would
have
the
effect
of
so
postponing
the
recognition
of
income
except
whereas
such
a
deduction
is
clearly
allowed
by
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute
and
it
is
our
position
here
as
i
will
now
go
on
to
discuss.
statute
does
not
permit
the
deduction
of
that
item
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
by
normal
accounting
practice
we
mean
the
general
accepting
accounting
rule
that
this
kind
of
capital
cost
must
be
capitalized.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we
sited
a
couple
of
accounting
text
in
our
brief
and
we
also
sited
the
rules
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
they
were
kept
on
the
basis
which
we
urge.
in
other
words,
they
capitalize
the
construction
related
depreciation.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
scc’s
rules
that
may
but
i
can
answer
that
question.
however,
the
federal
power
commission
which
regulates
this
company
does
have
a
rule
which
requires
capitalization
and
the
idaho
public
utilities
commission
also
a
regulatory
agency
that
which
respondent
to
subject
also
requires
capitalization.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
there
is
nothing
about
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
are
not
relying
upon
any
constitutional
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
certainly
no
deduction.
certainly
where
the
section
167
which
governs
depreciation
generally
would
not
permit
a
deduction,
the
tax
payer
could
not
take
such
deduction
merely
because
he
took
it
on
his
general
books
of
account.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
he
only
took
it
on
his
tax
returns
in
this
case.
taxpayer
here
did
not
take
the
deduction
on
its
general
books
of
account.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
turn
know
to
an
analysis
of
the
statute
which
must
begin
with
section
263,
that
section
provides
and
i
shall
quote
“no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
or
for
permanent
improvements
or
betterments
made
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
a
state.”
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
a
technical
provision
to
be
read
narrowly.
to
the
contrary,
this
court
has
historically
read
it
broadly
as
the
legislative
expression
of
the
accounting
principle
of
capitalization.
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
the
course
of
holding
such
diverse
items
is
brokeridge
commission,
stock
appraisal
litigation
cause
and
supplementary
savings
in
loan
insurance,
premiums
to
be
capital.
that
section
263
stands
for
the
broad
requirement
that
capital
items
must
be
capitalized.
they
are
of
course
statutory
exceptions
to
this
broad
requirement.
section
263
itself
contain
several
such
exceptions.
also
section
266
provides
an
exception
for
taxes
and
caring
cause.
but
there
is
no
similar
exception
for
depreciation.
there
is
nothing
in
the
code
which
would
accept
depreciation
in
the
requirements
of
section
263.
there
is
to
be
sure
provision
for
the
deduction
of
depreciation.
that
is
allowed
in
section
167.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
section
161
of
the
code
expressly
makes
all
business
deductions
including
the
deduction
for
depreciation
under
section
167
subordinate
to
the
capitalization
requirement
of
section
263.
in
other
words,
if
this
construction
related
depreciation
falls
within
the
general
terms
of
section
263
that
it
must
be
capitalized
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
it
might
otherwise
be
deducted
under
section
167.
we
believe
that
to
view
the
matter
in
this
slight
is
practically
to
answer
the
question
presented.
because
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case,
the
construction
related
depreciation
is
a
capital
item.
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case,
the
construction
related
depreciation
is
a
cost
of
construction
and
the
regulations
under
section
263
have
historically
acquired
the
capitalization
of
all
cost
of
construction.
moreover,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
regulations
under
section
48
expressly
state
the
requirement
that
construction
related
depreciation
must
be
capitalized
that
it
is
not
subject
to
immediate
deduction.
the
respondent
therefore
is
essentially
in
the
position
of
contending
that
the
secretary’s
regulations
misconstrued
the
statute.
but
in
making
this
contention,
the
respondents
following
far
short
we
believe
of
carrying
the
burden
or
showing
that
the
secretary’s
regulations
are
unreasonable.
the
only
statutory
argument
which
the
respondent
makes
in
this
case
is
the
depreciation
does
not
“an
amount
paid
out”
within
the
meaning
of
section
263.
on
the
first
place,
we
believe
that
this
argument
overlooks
the
fact
that
this
court
held
in
lincoln
savings
and
loan
that
capital
items
must
be
capitalized
whether
or
not
they
might
fall
within
a
strict
reading
of
the
literal
language
of
section
263.
we
need
not
reach
so
far
in
this
case
because
we
believe
it’s
clear
that
construction
related
depreciation
is
an
amount
paid
out
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
secretary
has
construed
that
statutory
phrase,
amount
paid
out
to
mean
as
being
synonymous
with
cost
incurred.
and
that
is
really
the
only
construction
in
the
statute
that
makes
any
sense.
that
is
the
only
construction
in
the
statute
which
harmonizes
the
fundamental
assumptions
of
the
income
tax
system.
congress
could
have
not
required
the
capitalization
only
of
actual
payments,
could
not
have
intended
that
only
actual
payments
be
subject
to
capitalization.
historically,
items
such
the
issuance
of
stock,
assumption
of
liabilities,
the
using
up
of
construction
materials,
the
exchange
of
property
for
other
property
has
given
rise
to
capitalization
has
not
been
immediately
deductible
even
though
there
is
no
actual
payment
that
is
taking
place
at
the
time
that
the
capital
asset
is
acquired.
what
is
important
under
the
statutory
scheme
is
simply
that
when
a
capital
asset
is
acquired,
there
will
be
some
cost
incurred,
liability
assumed
rather
responsibility
undertaken
which
properly
is
a
capital
item.
and
in
this
case,
the
respondent
by
using
out
its
construction
equipment
by
physically
exhausting
that
equipment
has
incurred
a
very
real
cost
in
the
coarse
of
acquiring
a
capital
asset,
and
that
cost
which
is
incurred
gives
rise
to
the
capitalization
requirement
here.
but
even
if
the
statute
were
read
literally
as
requiring
actual
payment,
it
nevertheless
does
not
require
that
payment
to
be
made
during
the
taxable
year
in
question.
thus,
when
the
respondent
pays
or
incurs
wage
expenses
in
the
course
of
constructing
capital
facilities
and
those
wages
aren’t
paid
out
until
the
following
year.
nevertheless,
there
is
a
capital
item
in
the
first
year,
there
is
no
actual
payment,
payment
is
made
in
the
following
year
but
it
is
the
accrual
of
the
wages
in
the
first
year
which
gives
rise
to
a
capital
item
but
perhaps
more
to
the
point
in
this
case.
if
the
respondent
purchases
construction
materials
in
one
year
and
then
uses
up
those
construction
materials
in
the
two
following
years,
when
those
construction
materials
are
used
up,
that
is
a
capital
item
which
has
to
be
capitalized
as
part
of
the
basis
of
the
capital
facilities
which
are
being
constructed.
and
depreciation
really
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
consumption
of
these
construction
materials.
the
payment
is
made
in
the
first
year
when
construction
equipment
is
acquired.
but
as
the
construction
equipment
is
used
up,
depreciated,
there
gives
rise
to
the
capital
item
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
they
using
up
of
construction
materials
in
subsequent
years
thus.
in
each
case,
you
have
a
payment
in
an
earlier
year,
but
the
using
up
of
the
asset
which
you
have
already
paid
for
in
the
course
of
constructing
your
new
capital
facilities
and
all
of
this
physical
exhaustion
or
usage
of
materials
as
part
of
the
cost
of
construction
represents
an
amount
paid
out
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
as
a
capital
item.
we
feel
that
this
conclusion
is
supported
by
other
provisions
of
the
code.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
sited
sections
174,
182,
615,
616
and
617.
all
of
these
provisions
permit
a
taxpayer
to
deduct
items
which
would
otherwise
have
to
be
capitalized.
and
each
of
these
provisions
does
permit
the
deduction
of
construction
related
depreciation
in
very
limited
circumstances.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
by
providing
for
the
deduction
of
this
kind
of
depreciation
in
those
limited
circumstances
express
this
in
--
in
the
first
place
it
expresses
awareness
as
such
depreciation
would
otherwise
be
capital
item
not
subject
to
deduction.
and
secondly,
it
indicated
its
intention
that
in
all
other
circumstances
not
covered
by
those
provisions,
this
depreciation
would
still
be
subject
to
capitalization
and
would
not
be
a
deductible
item.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
all
we
are
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
achieve
a
tax
parity
between
this
taxpayer
and
all
other
taxpayers
who
acquire
capital
facilities.
and
i
think
that
can
be
seen
to
the
following
examples.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
will
give
you
several
examples
mr.
justice
stewart,
some
of
the
taxpayers
who
do
and
some
who
do
not.
for
example,
if
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
rented
this
construction
equipment
instead
of
purchasing
it
and
use
rented
equipment
in
constructing
its
own
facilities,
those
rental
payments
would
all
be
capital,
none
of
them
could
be
deducted
immediately
and
all
be
part
of
the
new
capital
basis
of
the
new
facilities.
similarly,
if
this
respondent
form
the
subsidiary
corporation
to
construct
the
assets
that
kept
new
facilities.
although
that
subsidiary
corporation
would
be
entitled
to
a
depreciation
deduction,
under
section
482
of
the
code.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct
but
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
under
section
482
of
the
code,
the
parent
corporation
would
be
required
to
pay
the
subsidiary
enough
to
offset
that
depreciation
so
that
the
deduction
would
not
give
the
subsidiary
any
advantage,
it
would
simply
be
a
wash
and
the
payment
made
by
the
parent
to
cover
that
depreciation
would
be
a
capital
item,
would
not
be
deductible
to
the
parent
because
it
will
be
part
of
the
cost,
the
parent
expanded
and
bind
the
new
capital
facilities
from
the
subsidiary.
and
that
of
course
where
an
outside
independent
contractors
hired
to
do
the
work,
all
the
payments
to
that
contractor
including
amounts
necessary
to
cover
depreciation
on
the
contractors
equipment
would
be
capital,
they
will
not
be
deductible.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
right,
and
that
points
out
the
underlying
thesis
of
our
position
where
depreciation
is
incurred
for
the
production
of
immediate
income,
then
it
is
an
expense
of
operations
which
is
properly
deductible.
when
it
is
incurred
however,
not
for
the
--
not
in
the
course
of
an
ongoing
business
to
produce
immediate
income
but
to
acquire
a
new
capital
asset
which
is
only
going
to
be
used
for
the
production
of
income
in
the
future,
then
it
is
a
capital
item.
for
these
reasons,
we
asked
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
really
have
very
little
to
offer
but
something
that
closing
counsel
said
cast
mr.
justice
powell’s
question
somewhat
different
like
for
me
and
i
did
want
to
respond
to
that.
we
are
not
taking
the
position
in
this
case
that
financial
accounting
is
necessarily
the
guide
to
the
interpretation
of
the
tax
code
but
we’re
saying
is
that
when
taxpayers
claiming
a
deduction
which
is
not
even
permitted
by
financial
accounting,
then
he
really
ought
to
show
very
explicitly,
very
clearly
statutory
language
which
permits
that
deductions
and
its
our
position
here
that
no
such
statutory
language
has
been
shown
but
to
the
contrary,
we
pointed
out
in
section
263
explicitly
bars
the
deduction
here
that
is
necessary
impact
of
sections
161
which
makes
the
deduction
for
depreciation
subject
to
the
capitalization
provision.
there
are
a
number
of
small
points
in
case
which
has
been
argued
and
i
think
they’re
all
properly
answered
in
our
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
won’t
go
into
them
at
length
here
with
one
exception
which
is
the
taxpayers
argument
that
there
is
something
about
the
cases
under
sections
170
and
213
pertaining
to
the
medical
expense
deduction,
charitable
contribution
deduction
which
is
favorable
to
him
here.
well,
those
provisions
provide
for
deductions
of
amounts
paid
during
the
taxable
year
and
the
courts
have
construed
depreciation
is
not
being
an
amount
paid
out
during
the
taxable
year
for
purposes
of
those
deduction
provisions
but
statute
were
reliant
on
section
263
does
not
require
payment
during
the
taxable
year
merely
requires
an
amount
paid
out
at
sometimes.
as
we
have
shown,
there
has
been
an
amount
paid
out
here
and
it
is
represented
by
depreciation.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
history
of
estate
and
local
taxes
and
other
caring
charges
such
as
interest
is
a
long
one.
the
courts
in
the
--
i
think
20’s
and
30’s
perhaps
the
30’s
were
holding
that
those
expenses
were
not
capital
items
because
they
did
not
improve
the
value
of
the
taxpayers
property.
the
courts
held
it,
those
payments
of
taxes
and
interest
were
merely
incurred
to
retain
ownership
of
the
property
and
for
that
reason
were
not
capital.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right
and
i
think
that
the
holding
that
those
items
were
not
capital
is
subject
to
some
question.
but
in
our
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
depreciation
on
the
construction
equipment
was
incurred
in
the
course
of
improving
the
property
and
the
course
of
creating
a
new
capital
asset
and
that
is
clearly
capital
and
the
earlier
lower
court
decisions
holding
that
interesting
taxes
weren’t
properly
capital
which
is
really
a
holding
on
economic
grounds
whether
on
legal
grounds
i
think
really
aren’t
in
point
here.
nor
i
as
i
say
the
case
is
with
respect
to
the
medical
contributions
and
the
medical
deductions
and
the
charitable
contributions,
the
purpose
of
those
deduction
provisions
is
to
allow
a
deduction,
to
allow
some
tax
relief
when
a
taxpayer
incurs
an
expense
which
she
wouldn’t
otherwise
have
to
incur
and
all
the
cases
which
the
respondent
sites
involves
the
occasional
use
of
an
automobile
or
of
an
airplane,
an
automobile
or
an
airplane
which
would
have
been
depreciated
anyway.
there
was
no
reason
in
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
provide
a
deduction
or
to
permit
a
deduction
that
depreciation
which
would
have
been
incurred
anyway
and
therefore
i
think
the
courts
properly
held
that
it
was
not
deductible
under
those
provisions.
again,
those
decisions
it
seems
to
us
has
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case.
