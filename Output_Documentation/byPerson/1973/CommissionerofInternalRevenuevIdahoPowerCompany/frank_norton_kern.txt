mr.
frank
norton
kern
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
idaho
power
company
uses
its
own
equipments
such
as
trucks,
cranes,
etcetera
in
part
for
operations
and
part
for
maintenance
and
in
part
the
construction
of
its
own
capital
facilities.
that
equipment
has
a
life
of
approximately
10
years.
it
is
in
the
position
of
the
taxpayer
that
should
be
entitled
to
deduct
depreciation
on
that
equipment
over
its
life
of
10
years.
while
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
such
depreciation
should
be
capitalized
and
added
to
the
cost
of
the
facilities
produced
which
had
a
life
of
more
than
30
years
so
that
the
government’s
position
is
that
the
depreciation
on
the
equipment
used
in
construction
should
not
be
deducted
over
its
10
year
of
life
but
instead
in
aggregate
over
a
period
40
years
which
would
mean
that
the
taxpayer
couldn’t
recover
depreciation,
couldn’t
recover
the
cost
of
this
property
by
depreciation
for
a
period
of
more
than
30
years
after
the
property
was
no
longer
in
existence.
now,
there
are
several
plot
--
we
believe
that
the
answer
to
this
questions
turns
not
upon
a
question
of
accounting
but
it
turns
on
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
section
167
under
one
hand,
which
allows
the
deduction
for
depreciation
of
property
used
in
trade
or
business,
in
section
263
on
the
other
hand,
which
requires
capitalization
of
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
or
for
permanent
improvements
or
for
betterment
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
state.
now,
turning
first
however
since
much
has
been
made
to
question
of
accounting
in
the
briefs,
i
would
like
to
speak
just
momentarily
to
that.
this
is
not
a
question
of
the
taxpayer’s
accounting
per
books
under
section
446
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
that
section
basically
provides
a
taxable
income
shall
be
computed
in
accordance
with
the
way
the
taxpayer
keeps
its
books
but
under
the
regulations
applicable
to
that
section,
section
1.446-1a1,
it
is
stated
that
certain
special
items
for
which
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
its
own
rules
are
not
to
be
computed
in
accordance
with
the
way
the
taxpayers
keeps
its
books
and
included
among
those
as
such
things
as
research
and
experimental
expenditures
and
appreciation,
etcetera.
so
this
isn’t
a
question
of
the
way
that
we
keep
our
books,
the
taxpayer
keeps
its
books.
and
parenthetically
there,
i
would
like
to
state
that
there
are
many
things
besides
depreciation
that
are
considered
to
be
expenders
that
they
--
that
could
be
considered
to
be
cause
of
property
constructed
that
the
taxpayer
does
not
capitalize.
these
weren’t
mention
i
don’t
know
why
because
they
keep
appearing
in
the
briefs
but
in
the
briefs,
it
was
mentioned
taxes,
pensions,
those
things.
we
didn’t
think
it
was
important
but
all
taxpayers
in
a
profitable
position
deduct
interest
during
construction
and
the
internal
revenue
code
has
always
permitted
taxpayers.
the
permission
of
this
deductions
and
interest
and
taxes
could
be
deducted
regardless
of
the
existence
of
section
263
and
the
internal
revenue
code
since
1913,
since
the
code
came
--
since
the
predecessors,
the
code
came
into
existence
and
they
were
not
made
deductible
by
section
266
as
the
government
would
suggest.
they
were
deductible
because
--
before
section
266
came
in
which
permits
capitalization
of
interest
in
taxes
if
the
taxpayer
elects
to
capitalize
it.
so
there
are
whole
series
of
things
that
can
be
deducted
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
under
the
provisions
of
the
code
that
possibly
from
question
of
good
accounting
should
be
capitalized.
turning
specifically
to
the
question
of
financial
accounting,
it
is
suggested
by
the
government
that
depreciation
should
be
capitalized
because
it
is
good
accounting
to
capitalize
in
the
certain
tax
are
sided
to
that
effect.
however,
it
is
respectfully
suggested
that
the
government
would
not
be
willing
to
accept
all
of
the
various
types
of
rules
that
they’re
applicable
under
financial
accounting
on
the
one
hand
and
the
tax
accounting
does
not
accord
with
financial
accounting
on
the
other.
for
example,
the
government
referred
in
its
reply
brief
to
accounting
research
bulleting
number
43,
which
was
issued
in
1961
by
the
american
certified
--
american
institute
of
certified
public
accountants.
now,
in
1961,
in
that
particular
bulletin
that
is
pointed
out
that
as
cost
increase,
as
the
cost
of
replacing,
equipment
increases
as
equipment
is
improved,
as
inflation
occurs,
historical
cost
of
depreciation
does
not
provide
a
fund
for
replacement
of
equipment
and
it
is
stated
in
that
particular
bulletin
that
it
is
proper
for
management
to
make
an
annual
appropriation
of
net
income
and
contemplation
of
replacement
of
such
facilities
at
higher
price
levels.
this
is
what
financial
accounting
does
in
addition
to
the
deduction
for
depreciation
in
order
to
reflect
properly.
the
cost
higher
expenses
on
its
books.
now,
of
course
the
government
would
not
accept
that.
from
the
government’s
point
of
view,
that
would
be
the
creation
a
contingent
reserve
which
has
not
been
deductible
certainly
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brown
v.
hovering
in
1934.
so
i
don’t
think
that
the
government
is
really
understood
and
having
all
of
the
concepts
of
financial
accounting
from
applied
for
tax
purposes.
moving
ahead
however,
under
the
tax
law,
there
are
specific
accounting
rules
which
are
really
indicated
--
really
proper
rules
indicated
by
congress
in
adapting
the
provisions
applicable
to
depreciation.
congress
recognizing
as
long
ago
as
1954,
that
there
were
increase
cost
of
replacement
of
equipment
that
the
method
of
depreciation
at
that
time
did
not
permit
recoupment
of
the
cost
of
assets
in
the
expansion
of
american
business
provided
for
methods
of
accumulating
funds
more
rapidly
so
that
the
funds
--
accumulating
funds
more
rapidly
by
depreciation
so
those
funds
could
be
used
in
the
business
to
earn
other
funds
and
replace
equipment
or
could
be
used
for
expansion.
for
example,
in
1954,
various
methods
have
accelerated
depreciation
were
permitted
including
declining
balance
depreciation
at
twice
the
straight
line
rate
and
that
would
allow
the
deduction
of
approximately
40%
of
the
cost
of
equipment
in
the
first
one
quarter
of
its
life
for
about
two
thirds
of
the
cost
equipment
in
the
first
50%
of
its
life
and
then
added
to
that,
coming
ahead
up
to
the
present
time,
congress
in
1971
adapted
the
asset
depreciation
range
system
and
that
particular
system
permits
taxpayers
to
adapt
a
class
life
which
is
in
the
first
30th
percentile
of
lives
previously
used
by
taxpayer’s
in
the
best,
that
is
the
bottom
30,
the
quickest
30
and
then
to
reduce
that
life
by
20%
and
then
to
apply
accelerated
methods
of
depreciations
so
in
the
case
of
a
five
year
property
such
as
lave
for
example,
a
taxpayer
can
deduct
50%
of
the
cost
and
that
late
in
the
first
taxable
year.
now,
this
are
the
kinds
of
rule
that
apply
to
tax
depreciation
and
they
are
much
more
consistent
with
the
deduction
of
depreciation
on
the
taxpayer’s
equipment
over
its
own
useful
life
as
suggested
by
the
taxpayer
than
requiring
the
taxpayer
to
deduct
depreciation
on
that
equipment,
not
over
its
own
useful
life
but
not
until
a
period
of
30
years
after
the
equipment
is
no
longer
in
existence.
the
taxpayer
has
as
much
need
for
funds
to
replace
that
equipment,
those
automobile
so
as
the
cranes
that
it
uses
for
construction
at
the
end
of
their
useful
lives
at
it
has
for
as
any
taxpayer
has
for
a
need
to
replace
any
other
equipment
and
the
reasons
for
such
replacement
are
the
same.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
and
part
for
operations
and
part
for
maintenance
and
in
part
for
construction.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
yes,
the
company
keeps
records
on
its
books
as
to
the
usage
and
those
records
are
available
in
an
allocated
portion
of
the
depreciation
as
allocated
to
construction.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
taxpayer,
that
this
question
is
properly
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
of
sections
167
and
263
as
congress
manifested
its
intention
in
adapting
those
sections.
now,
to
bring
this
out,
we
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
beginning
since
these
sections
have
been
in
the
internal
revenue
code
for
the
first,
we
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
civil
war
act
of
1864,
and
the
legislating
predecessor
of
section
263
first
appeared
in
that
civil
war
income
tax
act
which
provided
that
no
deductions
shall
be
made
for
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings,
permanent
improvements
or
betterments
made
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
a
estate
almost
exactly
the
same
words
that
are
used
today
in
section
263.
now,
quite
clearly,
at
that
time,
these
words
were
not
intended
to
disallow
deduction
for
depreciation
because
there
was
no
concept
of
depreciation
at
that
time.
depreciation
was
not
a
deduction
under
the
act
of
1864
and
depreciation
accounting
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
united
railways
and
electric
company
of
baltimore
v.
west
did
not
come
into
use
in
the
united
state
until
after
1900.
now,
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
civil
war
congress
is
intention.
this
carried
over
up
to
the
present
time.
what
i
do
mean
to
suggest
is
that
then
in
1913
with
that
going
through
all
the
acts
of
that
particular
time
but
in
1913,
the
revenue
act
of
1913
which
is
probably
the
direct
predecessor
of
the
present
income
tax
law.
congress
chose
to
adapt
exactly
this
same
language
to
require
capitalization.
that
is
no
deduction
shall
be
made
for
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
permanent
improvements
or
betterments
made
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
estate.
now,
this
is
we
believe
important
because
in
the
same
act,
congress
indicated
its
concept
of
depreciation.
it
stated
in
that
act
a
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
loses
actually
sustained
including
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation
so
that
in
this
revenue
act
of
1913
under
one
hand,
congress
indicated
that
a
thought
depreciation
was
a
lost
in
value
or
a
decrease
in
value
much
as
it
has
been
described
by
this
court
in
numerous
decisions
such
as
the
lodi
decision
1927
or
maci
motors
1960
and
other
decisions
that
congress
thought
it
was
a
reduction
for
loss
or
decrease
in
value
under
one
hand
depreciation
was
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
required
capitalization
only
of
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
or
permanent
improvements
or
betterments
made
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
estate.
now,
this
situation
is
the
--
this
exact
language
continued
up
till
1918
when
the
lost
deduction
and
the
depreciation
deduction
were
separated.
and
then
head
up
to
the
present
time,
essentially
the
same
situation
has
continued
but
we
believe
that
there
is
further
indication
that
up
to
the
present
time,
congress
has
continued
to
intend
that
depreciation
shall
not
be
considered
an
amount
paid
out
and
shall
not
be
capitalized
but
instead
as
regarded
as
a
reduction
or
lost
in
volume.
and
the
reason
we
believe
that
is
that
we
site
the
opposite
side
i
guess
it
is
the
same
sections,
mr.
jones
pointed
out
what
we
said
it
at
first
in
our
briefs.
the
--
wherever
congress
has
intended
that
depreciation
shall
be
treated
as
the
equivalent
of
an
expenditure,
a
word
that
is
also
used
in
section
263
at
the
present
act,
the
equivalent
of
an
expenditure
or
of
an
amount
paid,
it
has
found
it
necessary
to
provide
a
definition
in
the
section
of
the
code
to
that
effect,
while
on
the
other
hand,
where
it
has
not
intended
that
depreciation
shall
be
considered
an
expenditure
or
an
amount
paid,
there
is
no
definition
throughout
the
internal
revenue
prior
to
that
effect.
now,
congress
has
not
found
it
necessary
to
define
expenditures
or
amount
paid
in
any
other
respect
except
in
its
consideration
of
depreciation.
and
in
sections
174
having
to
do
with
research
and
experimental
expenditures
in
section
182
having
to
do
with
farm
clearing
expenditures,
615
and
617
having
to
do
with
exploration
for
minerals
and
616
mind
development
expenditures
and
each
of
those
cases
where
congress
has
intended
that
depreciation
shall
be
treated
as
an
expenditure
as
it
uses
the
words
for
the
effect
but
allowances
for
depreciation
shall
be
considered
for
purposes
of
this
section
as
expenditures
paid
or
incurred
and
on
the
other
hand,
this
has
not
been
down
for
any
other
type
of
deduction
but
on
the
other
hand
where
congress
does
not
intend
that
depreciation
shall
be
considered
an
amount
paid
or
the
equivalent
of
an
expenditure,
it
does
not
so
provide.
for
example
in
sections
170
and
213
which
have
to
do
with
charitable
contributions
and
medical
expenses,
there
is
a
deduction
allowed
for
an
amount
paid
or
a
payment
and
that
neither
of
these
sections
is
the
word
pave
their
payment
defined
to
include
depreciation,
and
that
neither
of
this
sections
is
it
treated
by
the
courts
as
including
depreciation.
the
case
has
come
up
in
the
use
of
automobiles
and
where
an
automobile
is
used
for
a
medical
or
a
charitable
purpose,
deduction
is
allowed
for
the
gas,
the
oil,
the
maintenance,
insurance
and
all
similar
expenditures
but
no
deduction
is
allowed
for
depreciation
on
the
automobile
because
it
is
not
considered
as
payment
or
an
amount
paid.
now,
of
course,
section
263
does
not
have
any
definition
to
the
effect
that
amount
paid
or
expenditure
shall
include
the
term
depreciation
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
263,
in
light
of
the
way
it
has
been
used
since
it
first
came
in
to
the
internal
revenue
code
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
terms
amount
paid
shall
include
depreciation
as
that
within
the
scope
of
section
263
and
therefore
depreciation
need
not
be
capitalized.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
one
other
facts
that
the
government
has
in
its
briefs
and
mr.
jones
briefly
pointed
out
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
long
and
consistent
administrative
history
requiring
capitalization
and
depreciation,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
that
is
not
true.
section
263,
the
section
that
requires
capitalization
came
into
code
in
1913
and
also
did
the
allowance
for
depreciation.
going
back
to
administrative
history,
administrative
history
itself
if
you
regard
that
as
regulations
or
rulings
or
that
sort
of
the
thing,
the
government
did
not
say
a
thing
about
capitalizing
depreciations
on
1955
but
looking
at
administration
is
perhaps
encompassing
what
the
government
litigated.
back
in
the
1920s,
there
are
four
railroad
cases
in
which
concerned
in
a
sense
they
have
been
sited
as
concerning
the
requirement
for
capitalization
and
depreciation
and
what
in
fact
they
concern
was
the
movement
of
men
and
materials
in
work
trains
to
a
location
in
which
the
railroads
were
constructing
new
facilities.
and
apparently
buried
in
the
cost,
the
cost
of
this
movement
was
accounted
for
on
the
books
by
saying
that
it
was
one
cent
per
man,
mile
per
man
and
six
tens
of
a
cent
per
ten
mile
for
materials.
buried
in
that
cost
was
an
element
of
depreciation.
now,
the
government
at
that
time
stated
that
the
railroads
had
to
capitalize
the
cost
of
moving
man
and
material
to
these
locations.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
these
are
tax
cases.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
but
it
was
the
--
of
course
it
was
the
icc
accounting
that
got
depreciation
buried
within
it.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
the
government
said
that
these
cost
had
to
be
capitalized
and
the
court
four
times,
the
court’s
four
times,
each
time
it
started
off
for
the
board
of
tax
appeals
held
that
they
must
be
capitalized
but
in
only
in
one
of
those
cases
was
the
term
depreciation
ever
mentioned.
and
then
it
was
just
more
or
less
mention
in
passing.
there
was
no
discussion,
no
analysis
of
the
code,
no
consideration
of
sections
263
and
167.
now,
coming
down
ahead
up
after
those
four
cases,
the
government
then
came
upon
a
case
for
the
railroad
at
which
it
had
used
the
equipment
to
construct
its
own
facilities
and
in
a
great
northern
case
decided
in
1934
by
the
board
of
tax
appeals
and
the
government
took
the
position
that
that
depreciation
should
be
capitalized.
this
was
the
first
case
directly
concerning
the
matter.
now,
the
case
was
actually
argued,
the
government
never
took
the
position
of
section
263
requires
that
it
be
capitalized
or
its
predecessors
they
do
today.
it
was
actually
argued
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
construction
was
part
of
their
railroads
trade
or
business
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
and
the
depreciation
was
permitted
to
be
deducted.
and
then
you
go
ahead
up
to
1955
and
its
40
years
since
1913
and
at
that
point,
it
came
out
a
revenue
ruling
that
said
to
the
effect
that
taxpayers
had
to
deduct
the
--
or
had
to
capitalize
the
cost
of
planting
trees
that
they
were
engaged
in
forestry
and
that
included
depreciation
on
the
planting
equipment
and
there
was
a
similar
rule,
a
few
revenue
ruling
not
a
regulation
a
revenue
ruling
a
few
years
later
concerning
the
capitalization
of
depreciation
which
again
did
not
rely
on
section
263,
it
relied
on
a
case
that
said
that
construction
was
not
part
of
the
taxpayer’s
trade
or
business
and
i
might
say
of
course
to
make
it
clear
that
that
question
isn’t
before
us
today
because
the
government
has
conceded
that
the
construction
by
idaho
power
company,
all
of
its
facilities
is
part
of
its
trade
or
business.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
yes.
i
believe
that
is
what’s
made
most
clear
on
the
reply
brief
at
page
nine
in
that
footnote.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
no,
what
the
--
i
think
the
government
concedes
that
mr.
jones
i
am
sure
will
correct
me,
i
think
the
government
concedes
that
this
property,
that
the
property
used
for
construction
wouldn’t
be
depreciable
and
it’s
use
for
construction
under
section
167,
but
that
depreciation
is
so
far
were
entitled
to
the
depreciation,
but
that
depreciation
must
be
capitalized
under
section
263.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
no
questions
that.
we’re
--
mr.
frank
norton
kern
we
are
arguing
that
section
263
historically
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
disallow
or
to
apply
to
the
deduction
for
depreciation
because
the
depreciation
is
not
an
amount
paid
out
by
its
terms
section
263
requires
only
capitalizations
of
amounts
paid
out.
so
that
is
where
the
point
of
departure
is.
when
i
was
discussing
whether
or
not
there
was
a
long
and
consistent
administrative
history,
coming
then
and
up
to
1913
to
1955,
the
government
first
asserted
that
depreciation
should
be
capitalized
anyway
in
1955.
in
1958,
the
regulation
which
mr.
jones
refers
was
issued
that
is
a
regulation
1.263
2
a
and
that
regulation
sets
forth
examples
of
cost
which
the
government
state
should
be
capitalized
and
include
therein
cost
of
acquisition,
construction,
or
reaction.
now,
this
is
an
example
of
that
which
should
be
capitalized
under
section
263
and
immediately
before
that,
the
regulations
repeat
the
mandate
of
263
that
is
that
capitalization
is
required
only
of
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
or
betterments
etcetera.
but
the
regulation
does
say
that
cost
should
be
capitalized
as
respectably
submitted
in
no
place
says
that
depreciation
must
be
capitalized
or
that
depreciation
shall
be
treated
as
a
cost
for
the
purpose
of
section
263.
actually,
the
term
cost
is
applied
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
means
that
which
must
be
capitalized
under
the
code
because
certain
items
we
would
ordinarily
consider
to
be
cost
perhaps
from
a
popular
or
economic
point
of
view
maybe
deducted
and
certain
maybe
capitalized
so
that
cost
as
used
in
the
regulations
necessarily
refers
only
to
those
items
which
must
be
capitalized.
and
then
following
ahead
along
through
the
regulations,
up
the
last
word
which
the
treasury
department
has
issued
concerning
the
whether
or
not
depreciation
should
be
capitalized
has
to
do
with
the
investment
credit.
now,
the
investment
credit
has
allowed
under
sections
46
and
48
has
allowed
as
a
percentage
of
the
basis
of
property
constructed
or
acquired
including
property
constructed
by
the
taxpayer
and
another
fact
of
the
regulations
issued
under
sections
1.46c1
and
1.48b4
is
to
the
effect
that
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
take
the
investment
credit
on
its
construction
equipment
is
not
entitled
to
take
the
investment
credit
on
the
facilities
that
it
has
constructed.
in
other
words,
those
regulations
in
effect
or
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
position
taken
by
the
taxpayer
here
as
to
depreciation
we
believe
are
entitled
to
depreciation
on
the
equipment
that
we
used
in
construction
and
we
do
not
include
such
depreciation
on
the
basis
of
the
facilities
constructed.
now,
it
is
true
under
the
investment
credit
regulation
that
there
written
was
a
certain
self
serving
probations,
in
other
words
written
in
the
terms
if
depreciation
is
sustained
non
property
that
should
be
capitalized
like
then
it
won’t
be
capitalized
for
the
purpose
of
the
investment
credit
but
instead
will
not
be
considered
to
be
part
of
basis.
now,
if
that
were
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
law
to
be
exactly
contrary
to
the
investment
credit
law
statute
itself
because
the
statutes
requires
that
the
investment
credit
be
imposed
on
the
basis
of
property
constructed
by
the
taxpayer
and
the
regulations
in
another
fact
say
that
the
basis
shall
not
include
depreciation
incurred
by
the
taxpayer
on
its
construction
equipment.
in
consequence,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
there
has
neither
been
a
long
nor
a
consistent
history
all
over
the
treasury
department
and
requiring
capitalization
of
depreciation.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
idaho
power
company
uses
its
own
equipments
such
as
trucks,
cranes,
etcetera
in
part
for
operations
and
part
for
maintenance
and
in
part
the
construction
of
its
own
capital
facilities.
that
equipment
has
a
life
of
approximately
10
years.
it
is
in
the
position
of
the
taxpayer
that
should
be
entitled
to
deduct
depreciation
on
that
equipment
over
its
life
of
10
years.
while
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
such
depreciation
should
be
capitalized
and
added
to
the
cost
of
the
facilities
produced
which
had
a
life
of
more
than
30
years
so
that
the
government’s
position
is
that
the
depreciation
on
the
equipment
used
in
construction
should
not
be
deducted
over
its
10
year
of
life
but
instead
in
aggregate
over
a
period
40
years
which
would
mean
that
the
taxpayer
couldn’t
recover
depreciation,
couldn’t
recover
the
cost
of
this
property
by
depreciation
for
a
period
of
more
than
30
years
after
the
property
was
no
longer
in
existence.
now,
there
are
several
plot
--
we
believe
that
the
answer
to
this
questions
turns
not
upon
a
question
of
accounting
but
it
turns
on
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
section
167
under
one
hand,
which
allows
the
deduction
for
depreciation
of
property
used
in
trade
or
business,
in
section
263
on
the
other
hand,
which
requires
capitalization
of
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
or
for
permanent
improvements
or
for
betterment
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
state.
now,
turning
first
however
since
much
has
been
made
to
question
of
accounting
in
the
briefs,
i
would
like
to
speak
just
momentarily
to
that.
this
is
not
a
question
of
the
taxpayer’s
accounting
per
books
under
section
446
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
that
section
basically
provides
a
taxable
income
shall
be
computed
in
accordance
with
the
way
the
taxpayer
keeps
its
books
but
under
the
regulations
applicable
to
that
section,
section
1.446-1a1,
it
is
stated
that
certain
special
items
for
which
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
its
own
rules
are
not
to
be
computed
in
accordance
with
the
way
the
taxpayers
keeps
its
books
and
included
among
those
as
such
things
as
research
and
experimental
expenditures
and
appreciation,
etcetera.
so
this
isn’t
a
question
of
the
way
that
we
keep
our
books,
the
taxpayer
keeps
its
books.
and
parenthetically
there,
i
would
like
to
state
that
there
are
many
things
besides
depreciation
that
are
considered
to
be
expenders
that
they
--
that
could
be
considered
to
be
cause
of
property
constructed
that
the
taxpayer
does
not
capitalize.
these
weren’t
mention
i
don’t
know
why
because
they
keep
appearing
in
the
briefs
but
in
the
briefs,
it
was
mentioned
taxes,
pensions,
those
things.
we
didn’t
think
it
was
important
but
all
taxpayers
in
a
profitable
position
deduct
interest
during
construction
and
the
internal
revenue
code
has
always
permitted
taxpayers.
the
permission
of
this
deductions
and
interest
and
taxes
could
be
deducted
regardless
of
the
existence
of
section
263
and
the
internal
revenue
code
since
1913,
since
the
code
came
--
since
the
predecessors,
the
code
came
into
existence
and
they
were
not
made
deductible
by
section
266
as
the
government
would
suggest.
they
were
deductible
because
--
before
section
266
came
in
which
permits
capitalization
of
interest
in
taxes
if
the
taxpayer
elects
to
capitalize
it.
so
there
are
whole
series
of
things
that
can
be
deducted
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
under
the
provisions
of
the
code
that
possibly
from
question
of
good
accounting
should
be
capitalized.
turning
specifically
to
the
question
of
financial
accounting,
it
is
suggested
by
the
government
that
depreciation
should
be
capitalized
because
it
is
good
accounting
to
capitalize
in
the
certain
tax
are
sided
to
that
effect.
however,
it
is
respectfully
suggested
that
the
government
would
not
be
willing
to
accept
all
of
the
various
types
of
rules
that
they’re
applicable
under
financial
accounting
on
the
one
hand
and
the
tax
accounting
does
not
accord
with
financial
accounting
on
the
other.
for
example,
the
government
referred
in
its
reply
brief
to
accounting
research
bulleting
number
43,
which
was
issued
in
1961
by
the
american
certified
--
american
institute
of
certified
public
accountants.
now,
in
1961,
in
that
particular
bulletin
that
is
pointed
out
that
as
cost
increase,
as
the
cost
of
replacing,
equipment
increases
as
equipment
is
improved,
as
inflation
occurs,
historical
cost
of
depreciation
does
not
provide
a
fund
for
replacement
of
equipment
and
it
is
stated
in
that
particular
bulletin
that
it
is
proper
for
management
to
make
an
annual
appropriation
of
net
income
and
contemplation
of
replacement
of
such
facilities
at
higher
price
levels.
this
is
what
financial
accounting
does
in
addition
to
the
deduction
for
depreciation
in
order
to
reflect
properly.
the
cost
higher
expenses
on
its
books.
now,
of
course
the
government
would
not
accept
that.
from
the
government’s
point
of
view,
that
would
be
the
creation
a
contingent
reserve
which
has
not
been
deductible
certainly
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brown
v.
hovering
in
1934.
so
i
don’t
think
that
the
government
is
really
understood
and
having
all
of
the
concepts
of
financial
accounting
from
applied
for
tax
purposes.
moving
ahead
however,
under
the
tax
law,
there
are
specific
accounting
rules
which
are
really
indicated
--
really
proper
rules
indicated
by
congress
in
adapting
the
provisions
applicable
to
depreciation.
congress
recognizing
as
long
ago
as
1954,
that
there
were
increase
cost
of
replacement
of
equipment
that
the
method
of
depreciation
at
that
time
did
not
permit
recoupment
of
the
cost
of
assets
in
the
expansion
of
american
business
provided
for
methods
of
accumulating
funds
more
rapidly
so
that
the
funds
--
accumulating
funds
more
rapidly
by
depreciation
so
those
funds
could
be
used
in
the
business
to
earn
other
funds
and
replace
equipment
or
could
be
used
for
expansion.
for
example,
in
1954,
various
methods
have
accelerated
depreciation
were
permitted
including
declining
balance
depreciation
at
twice
the
straight
line
rate
and
that
would
allow
the
deduction
of
approximately
40%
of
the
cost
of
equipment
in
the
first
one
quarter
of
its
life
for
about
two
thirds
of
the
cost
equipment
in
the
first
50%
of
its
life
and
then
added
to
that,
coming
ahead
up
to
the
present
time,
congress
in
1971
adapted
the
asset
depreciation
range
system
and
that
particular
system
permits
taxpayers
to
adapt
a
class
life
which
is
in
the
first
30th
percentile
of
lives
previously
used
by
taxpayer’s
in
the
best,
that
is
the
bottom
30,
the
quickest
30
and
then
to
reduce
that
life
by
20%
and
then
to
apply
accelerated
methods
of
depreciations
so
in
the
case
of
a
five
year
property
such
as
lave
for
example,
a
taxpayer
can
deduct
50%
of
the
cost
and
that
late
in
the
first
taxable
year.
now,
this
are
the
kinds
of
rule
that
apply
to
tax
depreciation
and
they
are
much
more
consistent
with
the
deduction
of
depreciation
on
the
taxpayer’s
equipment
over
its
own
useful
life
as
suggested
by
the
taxpayer
than
requiring
the
taxpayer
to
deduct
depreciation
on
that
equipment,
not
over
its
own
useful
life
but
not
until
a
period
of
30
years
after
the
equipment
is
no
longer
in
existence.
the
taxpayer
has
as
much
need
for
funds
to
replace
that
equipment,
those
automobile
so
as
the
cranes
that
it
uses
for
construction
at
the
end
of
their
useful
lives
at
it
has
for
as
any
taxpayer
has
for
a
need
to
replace
any
other
equipment
and
the
reasons
for
such
replacement
are
the
same.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
and
part
for
operations
and
part
for
maintenance
and
in
part
for
construction.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
yes,
the
company
keeps
records
on
its
books
as
to
the
usage
and
those
records
are
available
in
an
allocated
portion
of
the
depreciation
as
allocated
to
construction.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
taxpayer,
that
this
question
is
properly
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
of
sections
167
and
263
as
congress
manifested
its
intention
in
adapting
those
sections.
now,
to
bring
this
out,
we
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
beginning
since
these
sections
have
been
in
the
internal
revenue
code
for
the
first,
we
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
civil
war
act
of
1864,
and
the
legislating
predecessor
of
section
263
first
appeared
in
that
civil
war
income
tax
act
which
provided
that
no
deductions
shall
be
made
for
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings,
permanent
improvements
or
betterments
made
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
a
estate
almost
exactly
the
same
words
that
are
used
today
in
section
263.
now,
quite
clearly,
at
that
time,
these
words
were
not
intended
to
disallow
deduction
for
depreciation
because
there
was
no
concept
of
depreciation
at
that
time.
depreciation
was
not
a
deduction
under
the
act
of
1864
and
depreciation
accounting
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
united
railways
and
electric
company
of
baltimore
v.
west
did
not
come
into
use
in
the
united
state
until
after
1900.
now,
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
civil
war
congress
is
intention.
this
carried
over
up
to
the
present
time.
what
i
do
mean
to
suggest
is
that
then
in
1913
with
that
going
through
all
the
acts
of
that
particular
time
but
in
1913,
the
revenue
act
of
1913
which
is
probably
the
direct
predecessor
of
the
present
income
tax
law.
congress
chose
to
adapt
exactly
this
same
language
to
require
capitalization.
that
is
no
deduction
shall
be
made
for
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
permanent
improvements
or
betterments
made
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
estate.
now,
this
is
we
believe
important
because
in
the
same
act,
congress
indicated
its
concept
of
depreciation.
it
stated
in
that
act
a
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
loses
actually
sustained
including
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation
so
that
in
this
revenue
act
of
1913
under
one
hand,
congress
indicated
that
a
thought
depreciation
was
a
lost
in
value
or
a
decrease
in
value
much
as
it
has
been
described
by
this
court
in
numerous
decisions
such
as
the
lodi
decision
1927
or
maci
motors
1960
and
other
decisions
that
congress
thought
it
was
a
reduction
for
loss
or
decrease
in
value
under
one
hand
depreciation
was
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
required
capitalization
only
of
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
or
permanent
improvements
or
betterments
made
to
increase
the
value
of
any
property
or
estate.
now,
this
situation
is
the
--
this
exact
language
continued
up
till
1918
when
the
lost
deduction
and
the
depreciation
deduction
were
separated.
and
then
head
up
to
the
present
time,
essentially
the
same
situation
has
continued
but
we
believe
that
there
is
further
indication
that
up
to
the
present
time,
congress
has
continued
to
intend
that
depreciation
shall
not
be
considered
an
amount
paid
out
and
shall
not
be
capitalized
but
instead
as
regarded
as
a
reduction
or
lost
in
volume.
and
the
reason
we
believe
that
is
that
we
site
the
opposite
side
i
guess
it
is
the
same
sections,
mr.
jones
pointed
out
what
we
said
it
at
first
in
our
briefs.
the
--
wherever
congress
has
intended
that
depreciation
shall
be
treated
as
the
equivalent
of
an
expenditure,
a
word
that
is
also
used
in
section
263
at
the
present
act,
the
equivalent
of
an
expenditure
or
of
an
amount
paid,
it
has
found
it
necessary
to
provide
a
definition
in
the
section
of
the
code
to
that
effect,
while
on
the
other
hand,
where
it
has
not
intended
that
depreciation
shall
be
considered
an
expenditure
or
an
amount
paid,
there
is
no
definition
throughout
the
internal
revenue
prior
to
that
effect.
now,
congress
has
not
found
it
necessary
to
define
expenditures
or
amount
paid
in
any
other
respect
except
in
its
consideration
of
depreciation.
and
in
sections
174
having
to
do
with
research
and
experimental
expenditures
in
section
182
having
to
do
with
farm
clearing
expenditures,
615
and
617
having
to
do
with
exploration
for
minerals
and
616
mind
development
expenditures
and
each
of
those
cases
where
congress
has
intended
that
depreciation
shall
be
treated
as
an
expenditure
as
it
uses
the
words
for
the
effect
but
allowances
for
depreciation
shall
be
considered
for
purposes
of
this
section
as
expenditures
paid
or
incurred
and
on
the
other
hand,
this
has
not
been
down
for
any
other
type
of
deduction
but
on
the
other
hand
where
congress
does
not
intend
that
depreciation
shall
be
considered
an
amount
paid
or
the
equivalent
of
an
expenditure,
it
does
not
so
provide.
for
example
in
sections
170
and
213
which
have
to
do
with
charitable
contributions
and
medical
expenses,
there
is
a
deduction
allowed
for
an
amount
paid
or
a
payment
and
that
neither
of
these
sections
is
the
word
pave
their
payment
defined
to
include
depreciation,
and
that
neither
of
this
sections
is
it
treated
by
the
courts
as
including
depreciation.
the
case
has
come
up
in
the
use
of
automobiles
and
where
an
automobile
is
used
for
a
medical
or
a
charitable
purpose,
deduction
is
allowed
for
the
gas,
the
oil,
the
maintenance,
insurance
and
all
similar
expenditures
but
no
deduction
is
allowed
for
depreciation
on
the
automobile
because
it
is
not
considered
as
payment
or
an
amount
paid.
now,
of
course,
section
263
does
not
have
any
definition
to
the
effect
that
amount
paid
or
expenditure
shall
include
the
term
depreciation
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
263,
in
light
of
the
way
it
has
been
used
since
it
first
came
in
to
the
internal
revenue
code
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
terms
amount
paid
shall
include
depreciation
as
that
within
the
scope
of
section
263
and
therefore
depreciation
need
not
be
capitalized.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
one
other
facts
that
the
government
has
in
its
briefs
and
mr.
jones
briefly
pointed
out
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
long
and
consistent
administrative
history
requiring
capitalization
and
depreciation,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
that
is
not
true.
section
263,
the
section
that
requires
capitalization
came
into
code
in
1913
and
also
did
the
allowance
for
depreciation.
going
back
to
administrative
history,
administrative
history
itself
if
you
regard
that
as
regulations
or
rulings
or
that
sort
of
the
thing,
the
government
did
not
say
a
thing
about
capitalizing
depreciations
on
1955
but
looking
at
administration
is
perhaps
encompassing
what
the
government
litigated.
back
in
the
1920s,
there
are
four
railroad
cases
in
which
concerned
in
a
sense
they
have
been
sited
as
concerning
the
requirement
for
capitalization
and
depreciation
and
what
in
fact
they
concern
was
the
movement
of
men
and
materials
in
work
trains
to
a
location
in
which
the
railroads
were
constructing
new
facilities.
and
apparently
buried
in
the
cost,
the
cost
of
this
movement
was
accounted
for
on
the
books
by
saying
that
it
was
one
cent
per
man,
mile
per
man
and
six
tens
of
a
cent
per
ten
mile
for
materials.
buried
in
that
cost
was
an
element
of
depreciation.
now,
the
government
at
that
time
stated
that
the
railroads
had
to
capitalize
the
cost
of
moving
man
and
material
to
these
locations.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
these
are
tax
cases.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
but
it
was
the
--
of
course
it
was
the
icc
accounting
that
got
depreciation
buried
within
it.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
the
government
said
that
these
cost
had
to
be
capitalized
and
the
court
four
times,
the
court’s
four
times,
each
time
it
started
off
for
the
board
of
tax
appeals
held
that
they
must
be
capitalized
but
in
only
in
one
of
those
cases
was
the
term
depreciation
ever
mentioned.
and
then
it
was
just
more
or
less
mention
in
passing.
there
was
no
discussion,
no
analysis
of
the
code,
no
consideration
of
sections
263
and
167.
now,
coming
down
ahead
up
after
those
four
cases,
the
government
then
came
upon
a
case
for
the
railroad
at
which
it
had
used
the
equipment
to
construct
its
own
facilities
and
in
a
great
northern
case
decided
in
1934
by
the
board
of
tax
appeals
and
the
government
took
the
position
that
that
depreciation
should
be
capitalized.
this
was
the
first
case
directly
concerning
the
matter.
now,
the
case
was
actually
argued,
the
government
never
took
the
position
of
section
263
requires
that
it
be
capitalized
or
its
predecessors
they
do
today.
it
was
actually
argued
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
construction
was
part
of
their
railroads
trade
or
business
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
and
the
depreciation
was
permitted
to
be
deducted.
and
then
you
go
ahead
up
to
1955
and
its
40
years
since
1913
and
at
that
point,
it
came
out
a
revenue
ruling
that
said
to
the
effect
that
taxpayers
had
to
deduct
the
--
or
had
to
capitalize
the
cost
of
planting
trees
that
they
were
engaged
in
forestry
and
that
included
depreciation
on
the
planting
equipment
and
there
was
a
similar
rule,
a
few
revenue
ruling
not
a
regulation
a
revenue
ruling
a
few
years
later
concerning
the
capitalization
of
depreciation
which
again
did
not
rely
on
section
263,
it
relied
on
a
case
that
said
that
construction
was
not
part
of
the
taxpayer’s
trade
or
business
and
i
might
say
of
course
to
make
it
clear
that
that
question
isn’t
before
us
today
because
the
government
has
conceded
that
the
construction
by
idaho
power
company,
all
of
its
facilities
is
part
of
its
trade
or
business.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
yes.
i
believe
that
is
what’s
made
most
clear
on
the
reply
brief
at
page
nine
in
that
footnote.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
no,
what
the
--
i
think
the
government
concedes
that
mr.
jones
i
am
sure
will
correct
me,
i
think
the
government
concedes
that
this
property,
that
the
property
used
for
construction
wouldn’t
be
depreciable
and
it’s
use
for
construction
under
section
167,
but
that
depreciation
is
so
far
were
entitled
to
the
depreciation,
but
that
depreciation
must
be
capitalized
under
section
263.
mr.
frank
norton
kern
no
questions
that.
we’re
--
mr.
frank
norton
kern
we
are
arguing
that
section
263
historically
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
disallow
or
to
apply
to
the
deduction
for
depreciation
because
the
depreciation
is
not
an
amount
paid
out
by
its
terms
section
263
requires
only
capitalizations
of
amounts
paid
out.
so
that
is
where
the
point
of
departure
is.
when
i
was
discussing
whether
or
not
there
was
a
long
and
consistent
administrative
history,
coming
then
and
up
to
1913
to
1955,
the
government
first
asserted
that
depreciation
should
be
capitalized
anyway
in
1955.
in
1958,
the
regulation
which
mr.
jones
refers
was
issued
that
is
a
regulation
1.263
2
a
and
that
regulation
sets
forth
examples
of
cost
which
the
government
state
should
be
capitalized
and
include
therein
cost
of
acquisition,
construction,
or
reaction.
now,
this
is
an
example
of
that
which
should
be
capitalized
under
section
263
and
immediately
before
that,
the
regulations
repeat
the
mandate
of
263
that
is
that
capitalization
is
required
only
of
any
amount
paid
out
for
new
buildings
or
betterments
etcetera.
but
the
regulation
does
say
that
cost
should
be
capitalized
as
respectably
submitted
in
no
place
says
that
depreciation
must
be
capitalized
or
that
depreciation
shall
be
treated
as
a
cost
for
the
purpose
of
section
263.
actually,
the
term
cost
is
applied
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
means
that
which
must
be
capitalized
under
the
code
because
certain
items
we
would
ordinarily
consider
to
be
cost
perhaps
from
a
popular
or
economic
point
of
view
maybe
deducted
and
certain
maybe
capitalized
so
that
cost
as
used
in
the
regulations
necessarily
refers
only
to
those
items
which
must
be
capitalized.
and
then
following
ahead
along
through
the
regulations,
up
the
last
word
which
the
treasury
department
has
issued
concerning
the
whether
or
not
depreciation
should
be
capitalized
has
to
do
with
the
investment
credit.
now,
the
investment
credit
has
allowed
under
sections
46
and
48
has
allowed
as
a
percentage
of
the
basis
of
property
constructed
or
acquired
including
property
constructed
by
the
taxpayer
and
another
fact
of
the
regulations
issued
under
sections
1.46c1
and
1.48b4
is
to
the
effect
that
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
take
the
investment
credit
on
its
construction
equipment
is
not
entitled
to
take
the
investment
credit
on
the
facilities
that
it
has
constructed.
in
other
words,
those
regulations
in
effect
or
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
position
taken
by
the
taxpayer
here
as
to
depreciation
we
believe
are
entitled
to
depreciation
on
the
equipment
that
we
used
in
construction
and
we
do
not
include
such
depreciation
on
the
basis
of
the
facilities
constructed.
now,
it
is
true
under
the
investment
credit
regulation
that
there
written
was
a
certain
self
serving
probations,
in
other
words
written
in
the
terms
if
depreciation
is
sustained
non
property
that
should
be
capitalized
like
then
it
won’t
be
capitalized
for
the
purpose
of
the
investment
credit
but
instead
will
not
be
considered
to
be
part
of
basis.
now,
if
that
were
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
law
to
be
exactly
contrary
to
the
investment
credit
law
statute
itself
because
the
statutes
requires
that
the
investment
credit
be
imposed
on
the
basis
of
property
constructed
by
the
taxpayer
and
the
regulations
in
another
fact
say
that
the
basis
shall
not
include
depreciation
incurred
by
the
taxpayer
on
its
construction
equipment.
in
consequence,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
there
has
neither
been
a
long
nor
a
consistent
history
all
over
the
treasury
department
and
requiring
capitalization
of
depreciation.
