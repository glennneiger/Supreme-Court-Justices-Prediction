put
you
back
along
way
mr.
jones,
i
suppose
the
same
issue
is
at
present
time,
succeeding
tax
full
years
of
the
taxpayer?
justice
harry

this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case
coming
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
idaho
power
company
is
a
corporation
tax
payer.
it
is
a
public
utility
engaged
in
the
production
and
transmission
and
distribution
and
sale
of
electric
energy
in
the
state
of
idaho.
in
addition
to
all
of
this,
the
company
for
many
years
itself
has
engaged
in
construction
of
capital
facilities,
mainly
transmission
and
distribution
lines
and
connections
between
them.
it
has
not
done
all
of
its
work
of
this
kind
and
but
it
has
done
a
major
portion
of
it
and
it,
thus,
had
scores
of
employees
so
engaged.
the
case
centers
on
tension
or
strain
between
two
provisions
of
the
federal
internal
revenue
court.
section
167
allows
a
depreciation
deduction
from
gross
income
with
respect
to
property
used
in
the
taxpayer’s
trader
business
or
held
for
the
production
of
income.
on
the
other
hand,
section
263
disallows
a
deduction
for
any
amount
payed
out
for
new
buildings
or
for
permanent
improvements
and
there
is
still
another
section,
161,
which
makes
the
deduction
provisions
subject
to
certain
exceptions
including
section
263.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
tax
payer
may
assert
depreciation
on
its
transportation
equipment
such
as
cars
and
trucks,
to
the
extent
that,
that
depreciation
relates
to
the
construction
of
capital
facilities.
the
depreciation
on
the
taxpayer’s
books
was
allocated
to
capital
rather
than
income,
but
this
was
required
as
a
matter
of
accounting
by
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
idaho
public
utilities
commission.
other
cost
of
construction,
such
as
wages,
were
similarly
charge
to
capital.
in
its
income
tax
returns
for
1962
and
63,
idaho
power
claimed
there
is
a
deduction,
the
construction
related
depreciation
on
its
automotive
equipment.
it
did
not
claim
as
deductions
other
construction
related
costs.
the
commissioner
disallowed
the
deduction
on
a
petition
for
redetermination
to
file
with
the
tax
court.
that
court
upheld
the
commissioner.
the
ninth
circuit,
however,
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
because
the
ninth
circuit
declined
to
follow
a
court
of
claims
decision
on
the
issue
that
appear
to
go
the
other
way.
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
equipment
depreciation
allocable
to
the
taxpayer’s
construction
of
capital
facilities
must
be
capitalized
under
section
263
and
is
not
allowable
as
a
deduction
under
section
167.
our
reasons
for
this
conclusion
are
set
forth
in
some
detail
in
the
opinion
filed
today.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
