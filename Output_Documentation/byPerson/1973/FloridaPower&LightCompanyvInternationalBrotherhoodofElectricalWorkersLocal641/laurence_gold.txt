mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
obviously,
this
case
has
a
substantial
importance
of
its
own
in
light
of
the
added
strength
that
will
either
give
to
the
employer
or
will
not,
but
our
interest
--
my
interest
on
behalf
of
the
afl-cio
is
both
that
and
another.
and
that
is
that
in
this
case,
the
board
is
operating
on
the
premise,
that
where
there
is
a
policy
which
has
been
embodied
in
the
act
in
some
respect,
the
board
can
create
an
unfair
labor
practice.
here,
the
policy
that
the
board
finds
in
the
act
in
which
we
don’t
dispute
and
of
course
which
this
court
discourse
that
on
length
in
yesterday’s
opinion
on
bell
aerospace
is
the
policy
in
favor
of
undivided
loyalty
of
supervisors.
and
from
--
in
order
to
effectuate
that
policy,
the
board
would
read
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
in
an
extremely
expansive
way.
now,
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
board
has
made
this
type
of
leap
from
policy
to
the
expansion
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
section.
i
think
its
worth
noting
that
at
the
time
the
1947
amendments
were
being
debated,
the
house
came
in
with
what
was
in
essence
a
laundry
list
of
union
unfair
labor
practices.
the
senate
are,
in
the
words
of
the
senate
report,
reduced
those
to
five
defined
unfair
labor
practices.
and
the
reason
that
the
evolution
was
as
it
was,
was
the
fact
that
the
case
bill,
which
was
a
predecessor
of
the
47
amendments
had
been
vetoed
and
senator
taft
was
very
conscious
to
the
fact
that
he
face
to
another
veto
and
had
to
get
out
a
bill
which
would
have
a
broad
enough
constituency
to
get
2/3
plus
1.
all
these
points
have
been
made
and
most
forcefully
in
our
judgment
in
insurance
agents
and
again
in
the
drivers
local
case
in
362
u.s.
in
insurance
agents,
the
union
tactic
there
at
issue
was
the
slow
down
strike
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
after
this
court’s
reaction
to
tactics
like
the
sit
down
strike
or
other
such
tactics,
that
the
policy
of
the
act
does
not
favor
that
type
of
union
economic.
the
board
responded
by
reading
into
8
(b)
(3),
which
requires
that
there
be
a
bargaining
in
good
faith
an
unfair
labor
practice
reaching
of
that
tactic.
and
this
court
has
responded
by
reversing
the
board.
i
think
its
very
much
in
point
to
note
one
facet
of
that
opinion
which
is
quoted
on
pages
15
and
16
of
our
brief
which
is
the
rest
colored
brief.
mr.
justice
brennan
thereby
was
responding
to
the
argument
that
since
the
activity
was
unprotected,
it
was
proper
to
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
he
said,
“there
was
a
little
logic
in
assuming
that
because
congress
was
willing
to
allow
employers
to
use
self
help
against
union
tactics
if
they
were
willing
to
face
the
economic
consequences
of
its
use;
it
also
impliedly
declared
these
tactics
unlawful
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.”
our
problem
remains
that
of
construing
section
8
(b)
(3)’s
terms
and
we
do
not
see
how
the
availability
of
self
help
to
the
employer
has
anything
to
do
with
the
matter.
and
i
think
when
we
turn
to
the
policy
of
undivided
loyalty
of
supervisors,
we
find
that
once
again,
congress
met
the
issue.
the
issue
posed
by
the
packard
case
by
giving
the
employer
a
right
of
self-help.
sections
2
(3)
to
2
(11)
and
14
(a),
where
this
matter
was
discussed
and
debated,
do
not
create
any
employer
rights.
as
mr.
cohen
has
indicated
what
they
do
is
create
a
privilege
in
the
employer
that
he
doesn’t
have
to
deal
with
unions
as
to
a
supervisors
and
that
he
does
not
have
to
bargain
collectively
with
supervisors
as
to
their
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
and
that
the
board
cannot
make
his
refusal
to
treat
supervisors
as
employees
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
all
of
these
to
restore
the
situation
before
the
wagner
act.
and
we
agree
that
the
employer
thereby
was
given
a
privilege
to
require
supervisors
not
to
join
unions,
to
require
them
to
resign
their
membership
without
being
subject
to
any
unfair
labor
practice
charges
himself.
but
it
also,
in
the
first
portion
of
section
14
recognized
that
employers
had
a
right
--
i
don’t
want
to
use
that
word
here
--
a
privilege
to
allow
their
supervisors
to
remain
in
the
union
or
to
deal
with
a
union
about
supervisory
employees
and
that
was
the
solution
to
the
conflict
of
interest
problem
that
congress
envisioned,
envisaged.
then
let’s
turn
to
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
in
one
respect,
congress
was
willing
to
go
further
than
giving
employers
self-help,
said
that
in
selecting
his
representatives
for
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
handling
functions,
he
could
not
be
subjected
to
strikes.
first
of
all,
the
main
function
of
that
provision
was
to
deal
with
multi-employer
bargaining
and
even
there
it
was
a
compromise
because
the
house
had
barred
multi-employer
bargaining,
and
again,
the
senate’s
solution
was
to
accord
both
the
--
in
this
case,
both
the
employers
and
the
unions
of
privilege
of
continuing,
but
to
say
that
neither
could
force
the
other
into
that
context.
and
the
secondary
purpose
of
this
was
to
prevent
unions
from
exerting
pressure
on
employers
to
select
their
representative.
mr.
cohen
has
talked
about
the
importance
of
the
word
“select”.
i’d
like
to
talk
about
the
added
importance
of
the
word
“representative.”
if
congress
had
really
been
focusing
on
the
conflict
of
interest
problem
that
it
focused
on
in
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
(a),
one
would
have
thought
that
it
would
have
used
the
same
term
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
rather
than
pick
out
two
specific
subject
matter
areas,
because
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
board’s
interpretation
means
that
some
supervisors
that
the
employers
assured
through
the
board’s
processes,
the
loyalty
of
some
supervisors
but
not
as
to
others.
it
seems
to
us
in
light
of
that,
it’s
more
logical
to
assume
that
what
congress
was
intending
was
to
assure
that
the
employer
would
be
able
to
speak
through
someone
who
is
really
his
own
choice
just
as
the
union
in
section
7
and
9
is
assured
that
it
will
speak
through
a
representative
of
its
own
--
of
its
own
choice.
but
to
move
that
over
into
a
completely
different
are,
namely,
whether
the
employer
can
act
through
certain
agents
in
getting
work
done,
rank-and-file
work,
as
opposed
to
supervisory
work
or
having
grievances
settled
or
collective
bargaining
done
through
his
own
people,
is
quite
a
leap,
a
leap
which
is
extremely
difficult,
we
think,
to
secure
from
the
language.
when
i
perform
a
service
in
fixing
a
machine
for
an
employer,
it’s
very
difficult
to
say
that
i’m
acting
as
its
representative.
i
am
maybe
part
of
management
or
whatever
but
i’m
not
acting
as
its
representative
for
collective
bargaining
or
the
settlement
of
grievances;
i’m
acting
as
its
agent
in
performing
that
type
of
work.
if
that
isn’t
true,
it
would
mean
that
any
employee
who
comes
back
and
does
the
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike,
thereby,
ipso
facto
becomes
a
management
representative
under
the
board’s
theory.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
position
that
i’m
stating
now
does
not
require
a
disagreement
with
oakland
mailers.
insofar
as
we
are
talking
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
“representative,”
representative
for
collective
bargaining
in
grievance
settling,
it
leaves
open
the
question
of
whether
the
board
could
say
that
it
was
empowered
to
prevent
unions
from
disciplining
individuals
because
they
had
interpreted
the
agreement
in
a
way
which
was
inconsistent
with
the
members’
interest
or
had
bargained
in
a
particularly
hard
way
or
it
pressed
a
grievance
in
a
particularly
hard
way.
we
are
not
here
asking
that
oakland
mailers
be
reversed.
it
may
be
that
--
it
should
be
reversed
but
that
isn’t
the
issue
here
as
we
see
it.
in
the
opening
of
our
brief,
we
quoted
the
chief
justice’s
remarks
in
one
of
the
obscenity
cases
last
year
that
the
fact
that
there
has
been
an
evolution
doesn’t
mean
that
the
final
step
is
right
if
it
is
one
that
never
would
have
been
contemplated
in
the
first
place.
we
are
at
the
far
end
of
the
spectrum
here
and
we
are
simply
asking
this
court
at
this
time
to
hold
that
the
board
has
made
a
mistake
at
this
point.
now,
obviously
the
reasoning
that’s
employed
will
have
an
effect
on
the
earlier
steps
in
the
evolution
but
the
reasoning
that
i’m
arguing
for
now
would
not
require
an
overruling
of
oakland
mailers.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
think
the
reason
they
can’t
go
the
last
step
is
the
argument
that
i
started
off
with
and
that
is
that
whatever
power
the
board
may
have
to
interpret
and
expand
a
provision,
it
can't
interpret
or
expand
provisions
into
an
interdiction
or
prohibition
of
the
use
of
a
lawful
economic
weapon
during
the
strike
unless
there
is
a
specific
warrant
in
the
legislative
history,
because
this
was
the
most
sensitive
area
of
the
whole
statute
and
the
very
point
of
insurance
agents
and
curtis
brothers
is
the
point
i’m
just
making,
the
point
that’s
embodied
in
section
13.
and
therefore,
we
need
not
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
room
for
expansion.
we
simply
take
the
position
here
that
there
is
no
room
for
an
expansion
whereby
the
board
would
interfere
with
the
use
of
this
economic
weapon
when
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
to
create
a
right
in
the
employer
to
use
anyone
whether
they’re
labeled
supervisory
employees
or
representatives
or
anyone
else
to
break
a
strike.
now,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
the
board
can’t
go
from
the
word
“select”
to
a
broader
term
in
order
to
safeguard
the
employer’s
interest
in
being
able
to
speak
through
a
representative
of
his
own
choosing.
that
simply
leaves
that
open.
what
we’re
--
what
i’m
concentrating
on
here
is
the
use
of
the
word
“representative”
and
the
use
or
the
misuse
in
our
judgment
of
the
word
“representative”
and
the
misuse
in
a
way
which
strikes
from
the
union’s
hands
and
otherwise
permissible
economic
weapon
in
support
of
a
lawful
economic
strike.
because
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
at
its
broadest,
no
matter
how
you
read
“select”,
would
only
seem
to
interdict
union
economic
weapons
that
are
improper.
and
the
impropriety
of
the
use
of
economic
weapons
is
judged
by
the
object.
if
the
object
is
to
prevent
the
employer
from
choosing
his
own
collective
bargaining
or
grievance-handling
representative,
then
that
is
the
area
that
the
section
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
in
section
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right,
or
to
expand
it
to
that
degree,
now
whether
they
are
--
it
can
be
expanded
in
other
areas
where
the
admonitions
contained.
mr.
laurence
gold
is
another
question.
mr.
laurence
gold
right
and
because
the
determinants
are
different
and
the
determinants
of
congressional
action
were
different.
and
again,
concentrating
on
the
meaning
of
this
word
“representative”
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
right
to
strike
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
the
adverse
effect
here
is
that
as
the
court
recognized
in
allis-chalmers,
the
use
of
union
discipline
over
members
is
an
important
ingredients
in
terms
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
union
strike
that
use
of
discipline
is
an
economic
weapon
supportive
of
the
strike.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
but
as
just
normally,
the
case
--
the
use
of
a
power
of
that
kind
is
intended
to
influence
conduct
and
the
very
fact
that
it’s
there
is
an
ingredient
in
the
strike
if
it
was
known
that
that
could
not
be
done,
the
trike
would
not
have
that
support
of
weapon.
and
as
i
understand
it,
that
was
your
reasoning
in
allis-chalmers
and
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
the
boeing
case.
so,
certainly,
both
sides
view
the
role
that
the
supervisor
will
play
in
doing
rank-and-file
work
as
an
economic
weapon.
the
employer
wants
to
use
the
supervisor
just
as
he
wants
to
use
those
rank-and-file
people
willing
to
come
back
to
work
to
break
the
strike.
insofar
as
it’s
done
by
using
rank-and-file
work,
the
union
in
this
case
is
claiming
that
it
has
a
countervailing
weapon
just
as
it
would
for
employees,
namely
threatening
them
with
discipline
as
members.
mr.
laurence
gold
my
understanding
is
that
we
cannot
even
expel
them.
both
are
involved
in
this
case,
yes.
and
to
us,
that’s
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
florida
power
--
in
florida
power
&
light,
there
were
expulsions.
so,
--
mr.
laurence
gold
so,
we
have
--
not
only
has
the
board
arrived
in
a
situation
which
this
weapon
to
support
the
union’s
strike
is
struck
from
its
hands
but
it’s
also
caused
the
union
to
keep
this
people
in.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
take
it
that
the
distinction
he
would
make
would
be
that
whether
it’s
a
general
policy
they
can’t
do
it
as
a
disciplinary
act.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
and
the
same
that
can
or
cannot
have
a
disciplinary
connotation
depending
on
the
time
it’s
employed,
the
circumstances
would
set
and
so
on
and
i
certainly
concede
that
distinction.
i
started
to
get
back
to
the
point,
the
meaning
of
the
word
“representative”
to
make
the
point
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
reaches
people
that
would
never
be
thought
to
have
been
a
problem
or
covered
by
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
(a).
many
of
the
early
cases
involve
union
attempts
to
have
the
employer
replace
the
attorney
he’s
using
to
bargain
his
collective
agreement.
and
i
don’t
think
that
congress
really
--
when
he
was
treating
the
undivided
loyalty
problem
in
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
had
any
idea
that
it
was
getting
into
that.
i
don’t
--
i
think
that
there
is
every
indication
that
it
looked
at
the
two
different
sections
or
the
two
different
complexes
of
sections
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
(a)
on
the
one
hand,
and
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
is
very
different
and
addressed
to
different
problems
and
we’ve
tried
to
indicate
the
line,
the
clearest
line
that
we
see.
i’d
like
to
just
take
off
certain
indicia
that
we
think
support
our
view
that
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
cannot
be
stretched
over
to
the
area
of
union
discipline
of
supervisors
who
do
rank-and-file
work.
first
of
all,
we
have
senator
taft
getting
up
on
the
floor
saying
that
this
section
is
not
perhaps
of
great
importance.
given
the
fight
over
the
status
of
supervisors
and
given
the
meticulous
care
with
which
the
use
of
economic
weapons
was
treated
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
and
elsewhere,
we
do
not
think
that
it’s
appropriate
if
we‘re
going
to
try
to
recreate
gemmative
values
which
were
present
at
the
time
to
answer
the
question
that
congress
perhaps
didn’t
focus
on
explicitly
to
use
mr.
come’s
words
to
attribute
to
senator
taft
and
the
other
proponents
of
the
bill,
a
diversionary
action
whereby
they
appear
to
only
create
a
privilege
in
the
employer
in
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
(a),
and
then
bring
the
board
back
into
the
whole
area
and
not
just
for
one
very
limited
proposition
through
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
secondly,
i
think
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
everyone
who
was
active
in
the
formation
of
the
1947
amendments
knew
that
union’s
discipline
members
including
supervisory
members
when
they
break
strikes.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
the
evolution
was
that
the
case
bill
treated
the
packard
problem
in
terms
of
status.
the
house
bill
treated
the
supervisory
issue
in
terms
of
status
and
there
was
no
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
most
probably,
because
they
barred
multi-employer
bargaining
completely.
and
as
the
senate
report
indicates,
really
the
major
function
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
was
to
deal
with
the
multi-employer
bargaining
problem
and
that
all
in
this
area
which
has
grown
and
overshadowed
the
other
completely
since
1968.
as
i
started
to
say,
it
was
understood
in
congress
that
unions
exercise
this
type
of
disciplinary
power.
both
all
the
members
and
supervisors,
mr.
justice
brennan,
has
noted
the
congressional
understanding
as
to
members
and
the
legislative
history
of
14
(a)
where
they
talk
about
--
in
a
house
report
where
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
unions
use
their
influence
to
have
organize
supervisors
not
work
during
strikes,
indicates
that
they
understood
that
this
wasn’t
something
that
was
only
done
against
members
but
it
was
rank-and-file
members
but
done
against
supervisory
members
as
well.
the
union
treats
--
by
in
large
it
has
treated
the
supervisory
member
as
being
just
as
much
subject
to
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
right
and
they
quoted
--
we’ve
quoted
it
in
our
brief
if
i
can
find
it.
i’m
sorry
i
can't
find
it
right
--
right
now.
i
apologize,
i
don’t
want
to
waste
any
time
but
we
have
quote
a
passage
from
the
house
report
where
they
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
rank-and-file
union,
i
mean
the
supervisory
union
at
ford
entered
into
an
agreement
whereby
its
people
would
not
work
during
a
rank-and-file
strike.
they
understood
that
unions
were
going
to
use
their
force
what
force
they
had
to
keep
supervisors
from
doing
this
work.
and
nevertheless,
as
we
say,
the
only
explicit
indication
that
they
wish
to
deal
with
the
conflict
of
interest
problem
was
to
give
the
employer
a
privilege.
starting
from
the
packard
case,
they
viewed
it
as
a
matter
of
status
and
deprived
the
supervisors
of
the
protections
of
the
act,
gave
the
employer
a
privilege
but
did
not
indicate
that
supervisory
members
would
have
any
special
status
as
members
of
the
union
immune
from
discipline
or
that
the
board
was
to
be
brought
back
into
this
whole
area
rather
than
to
protect
the
right
of
the
employer
to
speak
through
his
own
people
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
i
think
that
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
correct
as
you
stated
in
american
ship
and
brown
food.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
no.
we
don’t
think
it’s
question
begging
because
there’s
nothing
that
we
are
arguing
for
that
deprives
the
employer
of
any
power.
he
has
the
power
to
order
the
supervisors
to
work,
to
order
them
to
quit
the
union
in
order
to
--
so
that,
he
will
be
sure
that
they
are
not
subject
to
any
countervailing
pressure.
the
union
has
the
attractiveness
of
keeping
union
membership
in
whatever
discipline,
and
there
is
a
tug-of-war
and
it’s
no
different
than
the
tug-of-war
that
goes
on
as
to
the
employee
during
the
strike.
in
many
ways,
this
is
a
harsh
process,
but
this
is
what
congress
decreed.
an
employee
can
be
disciplined
if
he
crosses
a
picket
line.
he
can
be
permanently
replaced
if
he
does
it.
both
sides
have
economic
weapons
but
what
the
board
is
trying
to
do
is
enhance
the
employer’s
economic
weapon
by
depriving
the
union
of
this,
rather
than
according
with
what
congress
would
have
seem
to
have
done,
which
is
to
give
both
sides
certain
powers
and
privileges
but
not
to
create
any
federal
rights
or
any
federal
prohibitions
in
this
area
when
we
are
dealing
with
supervisors
working
during
the
strike.
and
i
--
with
all
deference,
i
don’t
think
it’s
question
begging.
i
think
that
what
we
have
in
this
area
is
the
whole
sensitive
subject
of
the
extent
to
which
these
five
carefully
limited
at
that
time,
five
carefully
limited
union
unfair
labor
practices,
can
be
expanded,
so
that
an
economic
weapon
which
congress
seems
to
have
understood
is
there,
namely,
the
right
to
discipline
supervisor
members
is
taken
from
the
union
in
favor
of
a
policy
which
was
effectuated
in
other
way.
not
effectuated
by
creating
a
federal
right
not
created,
not
effectuated
so
far
as
we
believe
from
anything
in
the
language
or
legislative
history
by
creating
a
federal
prohibition
in
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
we
do
not
argue
with
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
privileges
here
and
that
he
can
do
what
he
can
given
the
practical
situation
to
keep
his
business
running.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that’s
allowed
under
the
act.
but
the
union
can
do
what
it
can
except
insofar
as
congress
specifically
said
no
to
make
its
strike
effective.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
and
we’re
saying
that
there
is
nothing
specific
here
that
you
have
to
take
the
word
“select”
and
take
the
word
“representative”
and
take
all
that
--
the
silence
which
we
think
here
is
--
would
mean
and
take
it
into
and
turn
all
that
into
a
section
which
says
that
a
union
cannot
discipline
a
supervisor
member
who
acts
as
an
employer’s
agent,
and
not
as
its
representative
and
goes
in
and
does
track
work.
and
we
think
that
that
is
stretching
the
language
in
ignoring
the
legislative
history
to
a
point
which
cannot
be
done
given
the
background
of
this
act
and
given
the
admonitions
--
what
the
admonition
contained
in
section
13
which
has
been
given
flesh
and
force
in
cases
such
as
insurance
agents,
the
drivers
case
and
in
american
ship
and
in
h.k.
porter.
this
is
not
a
principle
which
cuts
just
one
way.
mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
obviously,
this
case
has
a
substantial
importance
of
its
own
in
light
of
the
added
strength
that
will
either
give
to
the
employer
or
will
not,
but
our
interest
--
my
interest
on
behalf
of
the
afl-cio
is
both
that
and
another.
and
that
is
that
in
this
case,
the
board
is
operating
on
the
premise,
that
where
there
is
a
policy
which
has
been
embodied
in
the
act
in
some
respect,
the
board
can
create
an
unfair
labor
practice.
here,
the
policy
that
the
board
finds
in
the
act
in
which
we
don’t
dispute
and
of
course
which
this
court
discourse
that
on
length
in
yesterday’s
opinion
on
bell
aerospace
is
the
policy
in
favor
of
undivided
loyalty
of
supervisors.
and
from
--
in
order
to
effectuate
that
policy,
the
board
would
read
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
in
an
extremely
expansive
way.
now,
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
board
has
made
this
type
of
leap
from
policy
to
the
expansion
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
section.
i
think
its
worth
noting
that
at
the
time
the
1947
amendments
were
being
debated,
the
house
came
in
with
what
was
in
essence
a
laundry
list
of
union
unfair
labor
practices.
the
senate
are,
in
the
words
of
the
senate
report,
reduced
those
to
five
defined
unfair
labor
practices.
and
the
reason
that
the
evolution
was
as
it
was,
was
the
fact
that
the
case
bill,
which
was
a
predecessor
of
the
47
amendments
had
been
vetoed
and
senator
taft
was
very
conscious
to
the
fact
that
he
face
to
another
veto
and
had
to
get
out
a
bill
which
would
have
a
broad
enough
constituency
to
get
2/3
plus
1.
all
these
points
have
been
made
and
most
forcefully
in
our
judgment
in
insurance
agents
and
again
in
the
drivers
local
case
in
362
u.s.
in
insurance
agents,
the
union
tactic
there
at
issue
was
the
slow
down
strike
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
after
this
court’s
reaction
to
tactics
like
the
sit
down
strike
or
other
such
tactics,
that
the
policy
of
the
act
does
not
favor
that
type
of
union
economic.
the
board
responded
by
reading
into
8
(b)
(3),
which
requires
that
there
be
a
bargaining
in
good
faith
an
unfair
labor
practice
reaching
of
that
tactic.
and
this
court
has
responded
by
reversing
the
board.
i
think
its
very
much
in
point
to
note
one
facet
of
that
opinion
which
is
quoted
on
pages
15
and
16
of
our
brief
which
is
the
rest
colored
brief.
mr.
justice
brennan
thereby
was
responding
to
the
argument
that
since
the
activity
was
unprotected,
it
was
proper
to
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
he
said,
“there
was
a
little
logic
in
assuming
that
because
congress
was
willing
to
allow
employers
to
use
self
help
against
union
tactics
if
they
were
willing
to
face
the
economic
consequences
of
its
use;
it
also
impliedly
declared
these
tactics
unlawful
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.”
our
problem
remains
that
of
construing
section
8
(b)
(3)’s
terms
and
we
do
not
see
how
the
availability
of
self
help
to
the
employer
has
anything
to
do
with
the
matter.
and
i
think
when
we
turn
to
the
policy
of
undivided
loyalty
of
supervisors,
we
find
that
once
again,
congress
met
the
issue.
the
issue
posed
by
the
packard
case
by
giving
the
employer
a
right
of
self-help.
sections
2
(3)
to
2
(11)
and
14
(a),
where
this
matter
was
discussed
and
debated,
do
not
create
any
employer
rights.
as
mr.
cohen
has
indicated
what
they
do
is
create
a
privilege
in
the
employer
that
he
doesn’t
have
to
deal
with
unions
as
to
a
supervisors
and
that
he
does
not
have
to
bargain
collectively
with
supervisors
as
to
their
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
and
that
the
board
cannot
make
his
refusal
to
treat
supervisors
as
employees
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
all
of
these
to
restore
the
situation
before
the
wagner
act.
and
we
agree
that
the
employer
thereby
was
given
a
privilege
to
require
supervisors
not
to
join
unions,
to
require
them
to
resign
their
membership
without
being
subject
to
any
unfair
labor
practice
charges
himself.
but
it
also,
in
the
first
portion
of
section
14
recognized
that
employers
had
a
right
--
i
don’t
want
to
use
that
word
here
--
a
privilege
to
allow
their
supervisors
to
remain
in
the
union
or
to
deal
with
a
union
about
supervisory
employees
and
that
was
the
solution
to
the
conflict
of
interest
problem
that
congress
envisioned,
envisaged.
then
let’s
turn
to
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
in
one
respect,
congress
was
willing
to
go
further
than
giving
employers
self-help,
said
that
in
selecting
his
representatives
for
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
handling
functions,
he
could
not
be
subjected
to
strikes.
first
of
all,
the
main
function
of
that
provision
was
to
deal
with
multi-employer
bargaining
and
even
there
it
was
a
compromise
because
the
house
had
barred
multi-employer
bargaining,
and
again,
the
senate’s
solution
was
to
accord
both
the
--
in
this
case,
both
the
employers
and
the
unions
of
privilege
of
continuing,
but
to
say
that
neither
could
force
the
other
into
that
context.
and
the
secondary
purpose
of
this
was
to
prevent
unions
from
exerting
pressure
on
employers
to
select
their
representative.
mr.
cohen
has
talked
about
the
importance
of
the
word
“select”.
i’d
like
to
talk
about
the
added
importance
of
the
word
“representative.”
if
congress
had
really
been
focusing
on
the
conflict
of
interest
problem
that
it
focused
on
in
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
(a),
one
would
have
thought
that
it
would
have
used
the
same
term
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
rather
than
pick
out
two
specific
subject
matter
areas,
because
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
board’s
interpretation
means
that
some
supervisors
that
the
employers
assured
through
the
board’s
processes,
the
loyalty
of
some
supervisors
but
not
as
to
others.
it
seems
to
us
in
light
of
that,
it’s
more
logical
to
assume
that
what
congress
was
intending
was
to
assure
that
the
employer
would
be
able
to
speak
through
someone
who
is
really
his
own
choice
just
as
the
union
in
section
7
and
9
is
assured
that
it
will
speak
through
a
representative
of
its
own
--
of
its
own
choice.
but
to
move
that
over
into
a
completely
different
are,
namely,
whether
the
employer
can
act
through
certain
agents
in
getting
work
done,
rank-and-file
work,
as
opposed
to
supervisory
work
or
having
grievances
settled
or
collective
bargaining
done
through
his
own
people,
is
quite
a
leap,
a
leap
which
is
extremely
difficult,
we
think,
to
secure
from
the
language.
when
i
perform
a
service
in
fixing
a
machine
for
an
employer,
it’s
very
difficult
to
say
that
i’m
acting
as
its
representative.
i
am
maybe
part
of
management
or
whatever
but
i’m
not
acting
as
its
representative
for
collective
bargaining
or
the
settlement
of
grievances;
i’m
acting
as
its
agent
in
performing
that
type
of
work.
if
that
isn’t
true,
it
would
mean
that
any
employee
who
comes
back
and
does
the
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike,
thereby,
ipso
facto
becomes
a
management
representative
under
the
board’s
theory.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
position
that
i’m
stating
now
does
not
require
a
disagreement
with
oakland
mailers.
insofar
as
we
are
talking
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
“representative,”
representative
for
collective
bargaining
in
grievance
settling,
it
leaves
open
the
question
of
whether
the
board
could
say
that
it
was
empowered
to
prevent
unions
from
disciplining
individuals
because
they
had
interpreted
the
agreement
in
a
way
which
was
inconsistent
with
the
members’
interest
or
had
bargained
in
a
particularly
hard
way
or
it
pressed
a
grievance
in
a
particularly
hard
way.
we
are
not
here
asking
that
oakland
mailers
be
reversed.
it
may
be
that
--
it
should
be
reversed
but
that
isn’t
the
issue
here
as
we
see
it.
in
the
opening
of
our
brief,
we
quoted
the
chief
justice’s
remarks
in
one
of
the
obscenity
cases
last
year
that
the
fact
that
there
has
been
an
evolution
doesn’t
mean
that
the
final
step
is
right
if
it
is
one
that
never
would
have
been
contemplated
in
the
first
place.
we
are
at
the
far
end
of
the
spectrum
here
and
we
are
simply
asking
this
court
at
this
time
to
hold
that
the
board
has
made
a
mistake
at
this
point.
now,
obviously
the
reasoning
that’s
employed
will
have
an
effect
on
the
earlier
steps
in
the
evolution
but
the
reasoning
that
i’m
arguing
for
now
would
not
require
an
overruling
of
oakland
mailers.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
think
the
reason
they
can’t
go
the
last
step
is
the
argument
that
i
started
off
with
and
that
is
that
whatever
power
the
board
may
have
to
interpret
and
expand
a
provision,
it
can't
interpret
or
expand
provisions
into
an
interdiction
or
prohibition
of
the
use
of
a
lawful
economic
weapon
during
the
strike
unless
there
is
a
specific
warrant
in
the
legislative
history,
because
this
was
the
most
sensitive
area
of
the
whole
statute
and
the
very
point
of
insurance
agents
and
curtis
brothers
is
the
point
i’m
just
making,
the
point
that’s
embodied
in
section
13.
and
therefore,
we
need
not
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
room
for
expansion.
we
simply
take
the
position
here
that
there
is
no
room
for
an
expansion
whereby
the
board
would
interfere
with
the
use
of
this
economic
weapon
when
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
to
create
a
right
in
the
employer
to
use
anyone
whether
they’re
labeled
supervisory
employees
or
representatives
or
anyone
else
to
break
a
strike.
now,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
the
board
can’t
go
from
the
word
“select”
to
a
broader
term
in
order
to
safeguard
the
employer’s
interest
in
being
able
to
speak
through
a
representative
of
his
own
choosing.
that
simply
leaves
that
open.
what
we’re
--
what
i’m
concentrating
on
here
is
the
use
of
the
word
“representative”
and
the
use
or
the
misuse
in
our
judgment
of
the
word
“representative”
and
the
misuse
in
a
way
which
strikes
from
the
union’s
hands
and
otherwise
permissible
economic
weapon
in
support
of
a
lawful
economic
strike.
because
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
at
its
broadest,
no
matter
how
you
read
“select”,
would
only
seem
to
interdict
union
economic
weapons
that
are
improper.
and
the
impropriety
of
the
use
of
economic
weapons
is
judged
by
the
object.
if
the
object
is
to
prevent
the
employer
from
choosing
his
own
collective
bargaining
or
grievance-handling
representative,
then
that
is
the
area
that
the
section
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
in
section
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right,
or
to
expand
it
to
that
degree,
now
whether
they
are
--
it
can
be
expanded
in
other
areas
where
the
admonitions
contained.
mr.
laurence
gold
is
another
question.
mr.
laurence
gold
right
and
because
the
determinants
are
different
and
the
determinants
of
congressional
action
were
different.
and
again,
concentrating
on
the
meaning
of
this
word
“representative”
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
right
to
strike
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
the
adverse
effect
here
is
that
as
the
court
recognized
in
allis-chalmers,
the
use
of
union
discipline
over
members
is
an
important
ingredients
in
terms
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
union
strike
that
use
of
discipline
is
an
economic
weapon
supportive
of
the
strike.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
but
as
just
normally,
the
case
--
the
use
of
a
power
of
that
kind
is
intended
to
influence
conduct
and
the
very
fact
that
it’s
there
is
an
ingredient
in
the
strike
if
it
was
known
that
that
could
not
be
done,
the
trike
would
not
have
that
support
of
weapon.
and
as
i
understand
it,
that
was
your
reasoning
in
allis-chalmers
and
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
the
boeing
case.
so,
certainly,
both
sides
view
the
role
that
the
supervisor
will
play
in
doing
rank-and-file
work
as
an
economic
weapon.
the
employer
wants
to
use
the
supervisor
just
as
he
wants
to
use
those
rank-and-file
people
willing
to
come
back
to
work
to
break
the
strike.
insofar
as
it’s
done
by
using
rank-and-file
work,
the
union
in
this
case
is
claiming
that
it
has
a
countervailing
weapon
just
as
it
would
for
employees,
namely
threatening
them
with
discipline
as
members.
mr.
laurence
gold
my
understanding
is
that
we
cannot
even
expel
them.
both
are
involved
in
this
case,
yes.
and
to
us,
that’s
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
florida
power
--
in
florida
power
&
light,
there
were
expulsions.
so,
--
mr.
laurence
gold
so,
we
have
--
not
only
has
the
board
arrived
in
a
situation
which
this
weapon
to
support
the
union’s
strike
is
struck
from
its
hands
but
it’s
also
caused
the
union
to
keep
this
people
in.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
take
it
that
the
distinction
he
would
make
would
be
that
whether
it’s
a
general
policy
they
can’t
do
it
as
a
disciplinary
act.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
and
the
same
that
can
or
cannot
have
a
disciplinary
connotation
depending
on
the
time
it’s
employed,
the
circumstances
would
set
and
so
on
and
i
certainly
concede
that
distinction.
i
started
to
get
back
to
the
point,
the
meaning
of
the
word
“representative”
to
make
the
point
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
reaches
people
that
would
never
be
thought
to
have
been
a
problem
or
covered
by
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
(a).
many
of
the
early
cases
involve
union
attempts
to
have
the
employer
replace
the
attorney
he’s
using
to
bargain
his
collective
agreement.
and
i
don’t
think
that
congress
really
--
when
he
was
treating
the
undivided
loyalty
problem
in
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
had
any
idea
that
it
was
getting
into
that.
i
don’t
--
i
think
that
there
is
every
indication
that
it
looked
at
the
two
different
sections
or
the
two
different
complexes
of
sections
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
(a)
on
the
one
hand,
and
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
is
very
different
and
addressed
to
different
problems
and
we’ve
tried
to
indicate
the
line,
the
clearest
line
that
we
see.
i’d
like
to
just
take
off
certain
indicia
that
we
think
support
our
view
that
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
cannot
be
stretched
over
to
the
area
of
union
discipline
of
supervisors
who
do
rank-and-file
work.
first
of
all,
we
have
senator
taft
getting
up
on
the
floor
saying
that
this
section
is
not
perhaps
of
great
importance.
given
the
fight
over
the
status
of
supervisors
and
given
the
meticulous
care
with
which
the
use
of
economic
weapons
was
treated
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
and
elsewhere,
we
do
not
think
that
it’s
appropriate
if
we‘re
going
to
try
to
recreate
gemmative
values
which
were
present
at
the
time
to
answer
the
question
that
congress
perhaps
didn’t
focus
on
explicitly
to
use
mr.
come’s
words
to
attribute
to
senator
taft
and
the
other
proponents
of
the
bill,
a
diversionary
action
whereby
they
appear
to
only
create
a
privilege
in
the
employer
in
2
(3),
2
(11)
and
14
(a),
and
then
bring
the
board
back
into
the
whole
area
and
not
just
for
one
very
limited
proposition
through
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
secondly,
i
think
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
everyone
who
was
active
in
the
formation
of
the
1947
amendments
knew
that
union’s
discipline
members
including
supervisory
members
when
they
break
strikes.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
the
evolution
was
that
the
case
bill
treated
the
packard
problem
in
terms
of
status.
the
house
bill
treated
the
supervisory
issue
in
terms
of
status
and
there
was
no
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
most
probably,
because
they
barred
multi-employer
bargaining
completely.
and
as
the
senate
report
indicates,
really
the
major
function
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
was
to
deal
with
the
multi-employer
bargaining
problem
and
that
all
in
this
area
which
has
grown
and
overshadowed
the
other
completely
since
1968.
as
i
started
to
say,
it
was
understood
in
congress
that
unions
exercise
this
type
of
disciplinary
power.
both
all
the
members
and
supervisors,
mr.
justice
brennan,
has
noted
the
congressional
understanding
as
to
members
and
the
legislative
history
of
14
(a)
where
they
talk
about
--
in
a
house
report
where
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
unions
use
their
influence
to
have
organize
supervisors
not
work
during
strikes,
indicates
that
they
understood
that
this
wasn’t
something
that
was
only
done
against
members
but
it
was
rank-and-file
members
but
done
against
supervisory
members
as
well.
the
union
treats
--
by
in
large
it
has
treated
the
supervisory
member
as
being
just
as
much
subject
to
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
right
and
they
quoted
--
we’ve
quoted
it
in
our
brief
if
i
can
find
it.
i’m
sorry
i
can't
find
it
right
--
right
now.
i
apologize,
i
don’t
want
to
waste
any
time
but
we
have
quote
a
passage
from
the
house
report
where
they
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
rank-and-file
union,
i
mean
the
supervisory
union
at
ford
entered
into
an
agreement
whereby
its
people
would
not
work
during
a
rank-and-file
strike.
they
understood
that
unions
were
going
to
use
their
force
what
force
they
had
to
keep
supervisors
from
doing
this
work.
and
nevertheless,
as
we
say,
the
only
explicit
indication
that
they
wish
to
deal
with
the
conflict
of
interest
problem
was
to
give
the
employer
a
privilege.
starting
from
the
packard
case,
they
viewed
it
as
a
matter
of
status
and
deprived
the
supervisors
of
the
protections
of
the
act,
gave
the
employer
a
privilege
but
did
not
indicate
that
supervisory
members
would
have
any
special
status
as
members
of
the
union
immune
from
discipline
or
that
the
board
was
to
be
brought
back
into
this
whole
area
rather
than
to
protect
the
right
of
the
employer
to
speak
through
his
own
people
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
i
think
that
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
correct
as
you
stated
in
american
ship
and
brown
food.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
no.
we
don’t
think
it’s
question
begging
because
there’s
nothing
that
we
are
arguing
for
that
deprives
the
employer
of
any
power.
he
has
the
power
to
order
the
supervisors
to
work,
to
order
them
to
quit
the
union
in
order
to
--
so
that,
he
will
be
sure
that
they
are
not
subject
to
any
countervailing
pressure.
the
union
has
the
attractiveness
of
keeping
union
membership
in
whatever
discipline,
and
there
is
a
tug-of-war
and
it’s
no
different
than
the
tug-of-war
that
goes
on
as
to
the
employee
during
the
strike.
in
many
ways,
this
is
a
harsh
process,
but
this
is
what
congress
decreed.
an
employee
can
be
disciplined
if
he
crosses
a
picket
line.
he
can
be
permanently
replaced
if
he
does
it.
both
sides
have
economic
weapons
but
what
the
board
is
trying
to
do
is
enhance
the
employer’s
economic
weapon
by
depriving
the
union
of
this,
rather
than
according
with
what
congress
would
have
seem
to
have
done,
which
is
to
give
both
sides
certain
powers
and
privileges
but
not
to
create
any
federal
rights
or
any
federal
prohibitions
in
this
area
when
we
are
dealing
with
supervisors
working
during
the
strike.
and
i
--
with
all
deference,
i
don’t
think
it’s
question
begging.
i
think
that
what
we
have
in
this
area
is
the
whole
sensitive
subject
of
the
extent
to
which
these
five
carefully
limited
at
that
time,
five
carefully
limited
union
unfair
labor
practices,
can
be
expanded,
so
that
an
economic
weapon
which
congress
seems
to
have
understood
is
there,
namely,
the
right
to
discipline
supervisor
members
is
taken
from
the
union
in
favor
of
a
policy
which
was
effectuated
in
other
way.
not
effectuated
by
creating
a
federal
right
not
created,
not
effectuated
so
far
as
we
believe
from
anything
in
the
language
or
legislative
history
by
creating
a
federal
prohibition
in
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
we
do
not
argue
with
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
privileges
here
and
that
he
can
do
what
he
can
given
the
practical
situation
to
keep
his
business
running.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that’s
allowed
under
the
act.
but
the
union
can
do
what
it
can
except
insofar
as
congress
specifically
said
no
to
make
its
strike
effective.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
and
we’re
saying
that
there
is
nothing
specific
here
that
you
have
to
take
the
word
“select”
and
take
the
word
“representative”
and
take
all
that
--
the
silence
which
we
think
here
is
--
would
mean
and
take
it
into
and
turn
all
that
into
a
section
which
says
that
a
union
cannot
discipline
a
supervisor
member
who
acts
as
an
employer’s
agent,
and
not
as
its
representative
and
goes
in
and
does
track
work.
and
we
think
that
that
is
stretching
the
language
in
ignoring
the
legislative
history
to
a
point
which
cannot
be
done
given
the
background
of
this
act
and
given
the
admonitions
--
what
the
admonition
contained
in
section
13
which
has
been
given
flesh
and
force
in
cases
such
as
insurance
agents,
the
drivers
case
and
in
american
ship
and
in
h.k.
porter.
this
is
not
a
principle
which
cuts
just
one
way.
