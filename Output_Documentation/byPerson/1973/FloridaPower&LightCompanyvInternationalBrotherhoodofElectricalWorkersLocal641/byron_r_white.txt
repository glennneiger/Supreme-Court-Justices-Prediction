so
you’re
saying
that
finding
them
for
doing
management
duties
during
the
strike
is
to
coerce
them
in
their
collective
bargaining
role
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
florida
light
&
power
tell
the
supervisors
when
the
strike
began?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
in
the
record
about
in
the
bell
case
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
you
said
to
your
supervisors,
you
may
come
in
or
stay
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
want
to
honor
the
picket
line
or
obey
a
union
rule,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
left
it
up
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
want
to
obey
the
union
rule,
go
ahead
and
obey
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
union
has
got
membership
rules,
you
don’t
cross
picket
line
during
a
strike,
you
left
it
up
to
the
supervisors
to
whether
to
obey
that
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
did
leave
it
up
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
are
not
being
deprived
at
anything
that
you
insisted
on
by
the
union
action
against
the
supervisor.
if
the
supervisor
--
if
the
union
said
no,
the
supervisor
--
we’re
going
to
fine
you
if
you
keep
this
up
and
he
stayed
away,
you
wouldn’t
have
said
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn’t
file
him
to
a
labor
practice
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did?
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it’s
not
as
coercion
if
you
said
stay
if
you
want.
justice
byron
r.
white
protection
of
the
management.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
go
ahead
i
have
got
all
i
need.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
take
the
same
argument
about
a
fine
composed
by
the
union
for
a
supervisor
in
the
process
of
handling
a
grievance
construing
the
contract
in
a
certain
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
basis
needed
to
draw
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
you
do,
then
you
do
accept
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
way
you
accepted
is
by
saying
that
the
union
would
be
influencing
rather
than
replacing
them
if
they
find
this
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
--
has
the
board
indicated
that
the
union
could
or
could
not
expel
the
supervisor
for
crossing
the
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
both
--
are
both
expressly
involved
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
well
as
fine.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
i
thought
mr.
--
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
mr.
cohen
had
indicated
that
that
is
a
general
policy
at
least
the
union
could
insist
that
supervisors
get
out
of
the
union
when
they
become
supervisors.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
they
were
going
really
--
if
they’re
really
serious
about
it,
they
would
have
to
expel
everybody.
all
the
supervisors
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
not
just
the
ones
who
crossed
the
picket
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you’re

that
finding

well
now,
you
