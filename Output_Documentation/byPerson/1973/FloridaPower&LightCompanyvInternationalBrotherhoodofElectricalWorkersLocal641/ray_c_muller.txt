mr.
ray
c.
muller
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
ray
muller
for
petitioner
florida
power
&
light
in
this
manner.
mr.
come
has
reviewed
the
facts
and
reviewed
the
law.
i’ll
try
to
not
recover
the
ground
he
has
covered.
there
is,
however,
an
area
of
this
problem
that
i
would
like
to
underline.
specifically,
as
a
management
representative,
it’s
difficult
for
me
to
accept
a
distinction
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
union
and
to
some
extent
by
the
board
that
there
is
a
difference
between
so
called
rank-and-file
work
and
management
work.
and
that
that
distinction
can
be
a
predicate
for
finding
unlawful
fines
or
lawful
fines.
as
a
little
background,
this
case
came
before
the
labor
board
following
a
complaint
by
its
regional
director
on
a
written
stipulation
of
the
parties
as
to
issues
and
facts.
the
stipulated
issue
before
the
board
was
whether
or
not
the
union’s
lawfully
fined
supervisors
with
cross
picket
lines
and
continued
to
work
for
the
company.
no
distinction
in
the
original
stipulation.
thereafter
the
board
in
this
decision
obliquely
inserted
the
rank-and-file
versus
management
work
issue
by
finding
that
the
supervisory
fines
had
been
imposed
for
working,
performing
work
behind
the
picket
line
and
“including
bargaining
unit
work”
and
that
the
fines
were
illegal.
so
the
board
initially
inserted
that
distinction.
thereafter
the
court
of
appeals
picked
up
that
distinction.
court
of
appeals
refined
it
further
and
said
that
if
the
individual
supervisor
was
engaged
in
management
work,
he
was
immune
from
union
discipline.
if
rank-and-file,
he
could
be
disciplined.
the
unions
apparently
agree
with
that
position.
our
petition
to
this
court
for
certiorari
also
framed,
the
petitioner
florida
power
&
light,
also
framed
the
issue
and
confined
it
to
work
for
the
company
behind
the
picket
line.
we
made
no
distinction
between
management
work
and
so-called
rank-and-file
work.
the
union’s
in
their
brief
agree
the
congressional
policy
--
pardon
me
--
agree
the
congressional
policy
reflects
an
intent
that
employers
be
assured
the
undivided
loyalty
of
their
supervisors.
if
that
is
true,
what
does
undivided
loyalty
mean?
it
must
mean
doing
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
management,
the
employer.
in
a
strike
situation,
as
the
course
apparent
that
undivided
loyalty
requires
a
supervisor
to
do
whatever
work
is
necessary.
he
is
management.
realistically,
from
the
strike
situation,
no
distinction
is
made
between
rank-and-file
work,
supervisory
work,
and
management
work.
there
is
work
there
and
it
must
be
done.
to
include
that
lawfulness
or
unlawfulness
of
a
supervisory
fine
shall
be
controlled
by
the
type
of
work
the
supervisor
may
be
performing
behind
the
picket
line
would
create
an
entirely
unrealistic
situation,
an
unworkable
situation.
consider,
this
florida
power
--
well
i’m
sorry,
the
current
--
the
florida
power
&
light
strike
that
we
were
talking
about
lasted
in
excess
of
30
days.
currently,
we
went
through
another
strike
that
lasted
in
excess
of
60
days.
consider,
the
supervisor,
if
we’re
to
use
the
distinction
management
work
versus
rank-and-file
work,
we
have
the
question.
during
a
60
days
strike,
did
he
spend
one
day
doing
management
work?
five
days
doing
rank-and-file
work?
was
it
an
hour?
does
this
particular
supervisor
have
as
his
usual
duties,
the
working
with
a
crew
doing
manual
labor?
mr.
ray
c.
muller
he
had
no
one
to
supervise
but
he
was
--
mr.
ray
c.
muller
he
was
performing
a
management
function.
he
was
performing
a
--
mr.
ray
c.
muller
--
management
function.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
other
than
supervising,
that’s
right.
we
submit
that
the
distinction
between
management
work
which
the
court
of
appeals
says,
is
immune
from
discipline,
and
rank-and-file
work
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
not
immune
from
discipline,
is
a
distinction
without
a
substance.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
mr.
justice
white,
it
was
left
to
their
discretion
whether
they
would
come
in
or
not.
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
left
to
their
discretion.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
yes
it
is.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
that’s
right.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
they
were
encouraged
to
come
in
but
there
was
no
compulsion
put
on
the
supervisors
to
come
in.
come
in
or
you’ll
be
fired.
that
type
of
thing.
they
were
encouraged
to
come
in.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
yes.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
not
particularly
in
the
union
rule
sense,
more
in
the
sense
if
you
feel
a
loyalty
sense,
but
for
any
reason,
you
don’t
want
to
come
in
with
sense.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
your
honor,
it
is
a
difficult
situation
this
court
has
currently
before.
that
case
--
mr.
ray
c.
muller
yes.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
ray
c.
muller
we
did,
yes.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
as
to
free
our
supervisors
and
the
company
really
from
this
coercion
if
you
like.
we,
the
section
we
are
talking
about,
it
is
not
--
mr.
ray
c.
muller
well
i’m
simplifying
it
just
as
you
are
simplifying
it
to
me.
this
section
does
not
protect
the
rights
of
supervisors.
the
section
we
are
dealing
with,
of
course,
is
protection
of
the
management.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
right.
mr.
ray
c.
muller
may
i
digress
a
minute
for
your
question?
mr.
ray
c.
muller
i
may
say
this
that
we
are
in
a
right
to
work
state
in
florida.
this
court
presently
has
before
the
case
i
believe
is
called
beasley
v.
food
fair,
where
a
court
in
carolina
held
that
a
violations
state
right
to
working
law,
to
discharge
supervisors.
it
is
not
an
easy
decision
to
tell
an
employer
“discharge
your
supervisor,
they
won’t
come
to
work.”
we
submit
to
you
that
management
is
entitled
for
the
undivided
loyalty
of
its
supervisors.
if
the
supervisor
cannot
or
will
not
do
all
in
the
best
interest
of
management,
because
of
the
union
sanctions
or
the
threat
of
union
sanctions,
the
employer
is
restrained
in
the
use
in
the
selection
of
that
representative.
and
we
submit
the
imposition
of
those
union
sanctions,
violates
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
act.

you.
