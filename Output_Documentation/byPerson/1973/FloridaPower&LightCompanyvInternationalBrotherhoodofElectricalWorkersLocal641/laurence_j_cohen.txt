mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
come
has
spoken
of
the
practicalities.
he
has
said
the
effects
of
these
cases
as
a
practical
matter.
we
submit
that
what
these
cases
involve
is
not
a
practical
matter
but
a
statutory
matter.
we
view
the
controlling
question
here
as
one
of
congressional
intentions
specifically.
is
there
anything
in
either
the
language
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
or
its
legislative
history
that
shows
that
congress
ever
contemplated
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
that
section,
for
a
union
to
fine
its
members
who
are
supervisors
with
the
consent
of
the
employer,
for
engaging
in
strike
bridging.
the
language
of
the
section
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
is
quite
clear,
it’s
unambiguous,
it’s
narrow.
the
senate
report
which
we
have
sited
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief,
also
shows
that
congress
intended
no
greater
reach
for
that
section
in
its
words
canoe.
it
speaks
of
forcing
employers
in
or
out
of
employer
associations
and
it
says
also,
this
section
would
not
permit
a
union
to
dictate
who
shall
represent
an
employer
in
the
settlement
of
employee
grievances
or
to
compel
an
employer
--
to
compel
the
removal
of
a
personnel
director
or
supervisor
who
has
been
delegated
the
function
of
settling
grievances.
the
remarks
of
senators
taft
and
ellender
which
we’ve
sited
in
the
page
16
of
our
brief,
again
show
that
that
is
all
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
and
in
fact,
in
professing
his
description
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
senator
taft
said
that
the
section
was
not
“perhaps
of
tremendous
importance.”
there
is
simply
nothing
that
the
board
can
point
to,
to
show
that
congress
was
thinking
of
the
discipline
of
supervisors
who
are
permitted
to
remain
union
members
when
it
enacted
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
which
deals
with
this
divided
loyalty’s
question.
it
was
obviously
very
much
in
the
mind
of
the
congress
at
that
time
and
congress
spoke
through
sections
2
(3),
2
(11),
and
14
(a).
but
we
think
the
significant
point
is
what
they
did.
congress
did
not
create
an
unfair
labor
practice.
rather
there
were
two
what
we
might
call
extreme
positions
advanced
at
the
time.
one
group
said,
the
foreman
supervisor
should
have
a
chance
to
remain
in
their
own
unions,
perhaps
not
in
employee
unions
but
in
their
own
unions.
another
group
said
it
should
be
outlawed
completely.
and
they
compromise
that
was
struck
said,
it’s
up
to
the
employer
to
decide
what
he
wants
to
let
them
do?
they
were
removed
form
the
definition
of
employee
in
section
2
(3).
they
were
stripped
of
their
rights
under
the
act
and
they
were
allowed
to
remain
union
members
only
of
the
sufferings
of
their
employer.
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
which
the
other
side
can
point
which
shows
that
congress
intended
to
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
supervisors
were
to
remain
in
the
union,
or
once
they
were
allowed
to
remain
and
were
subject
to
the
same
union
rules
as
other
members,
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
that
is
what
we
think
congress
intended.
yes.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
we
think
that
is
precisely
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
all
that
it
had
in
mind.
now,
we
are
confronted
with
that
argument
when
we
are
here.
well
what
about
the
effect
of
this
so-called
evolution
of
cases
since
oakland
mailers
in
1968.
of
course,
we
know
as
this
court
observed
yesterday
in
its
bell
aerospace
decision
once
again
that
it’s
always
significant
to
look
at
what
the
board
has
done
for
20
or
25
years
in
assessing
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
however,
we
also
recognize
that
no
court
of
appeals
has
accepted
the
argument
today,
that
even
the
oakland
mailers
doctrine
steps
beyond
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
because
it
affects
more
than
the
selection,
the
identity
question.
but
as
the
court
below
held,
even
if
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
is
read
more
broadly
as
the
board
has
read
it
in
oakland
mailers,
it
still
has
to
have
some
relationship
to
the
performance
of
an
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
function,
which
is
either
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment.
or
at
the
very
least,
what
the
board
has
second
step
stretched
it
to,
to
include
the
performance
of
some
supervisory
duty
as
they
are
defined
in
section
2
(11).
you
see
there,
the
board
has
preceded
gradually
--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
our
principal
position
here
does
not,
mr.
justice
white.
we
do
believe
that
the
oakland
mailers
doctrine
actually
step
beyond
the
intention
of
congress
and
if
that
is
so
and
if
the
court
should
so
decide,
then
yes
even
that
would
be
outside
of
the
reach
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
but
we
take
a
narrower
position
here
as
did
the
court
below
that
even
if
oakland
mailers
is
correct
in
saying
that
anytime
the
employer
is
engaged
in
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
function,
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment,
or
a
supervisory
duty
then
the
union
may
not
touch
him.
we
are
willing
to
go
that
far
even
though
we
think
that’s
beyond
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
we
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
congress
intended
to
read
the
board
completely
out
of
the
picture.
now,
let
me
explain
that.
congress
deprived
the
supervisor
both
of
his
status
as
an
employee
and
of
any
rights
under
the
act.
in
the
words
of
senator
taft,
they
were
“generally
restored
to
the
basis
which
they
enjoyed
before
the
passage
of
the
wagner
act.”
it
was
clear
from
the
debates
that
congress
was
concerned
that
the
board
was
lending
its
processes
to
the
organization
of
supervisors.
and
it
not
only
read
that
the
supervisor
out
of
the
protection
of
the
act,
but
it
read
the
board
out
of
the
picture.
it
said
we
are
going
to
leave
this
to
the
employer,
he
can
strike
an
agreement
with
the
union
at
the
bargaining
table
if
he
wants
to
permit
them
to
retain
union
membership
but
he
doesn’t
have
to.
and
in
that
sense,
the
only
thing
that
congress
did
was
to
give
the
employer
the
leeway
to
decide.
and
we
believe
it
intended
to
keep
the
board
out
of
the
business
of
regulating
supervisory
activities
or
the
relationship
of
the
union
to
its
supervisors.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
of
that
there
is
absolutely
no
question.
that’s
correct.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
which
is,
as
we
submit,
a
very
narrowly
defined
unfair
labor
practice,
but
we
are
taking
the
principal
position
here,
and
i
am
certainly
willing
to
argue
it
on
that
basis
that
the
board
may
prohibit
under
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
the
imposition
of
union
rules
on
supervisors
when
they
are
functioning
as
supervisors
or
as
a
management
agent.
but
as
the
court
below
held
to
say
that
the
performance
of
rank-and-file
work,
in
the
course
of
a
strike
is
somehow
an
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
duty
or
a
2
(11)
function.
it
is
like
saying
black
is
white.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
it
does
not.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
representative
for
two
purposes,
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
under
insurance
agents,
it
is
true
that
a
strike
he
is
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
but
that
is
not
enough,
we
submit,
to
read
this
activity
into
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
a
strike
is
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
obviously
a
supervisor
who
returns
to
work
aides
the
employer.
but
so
as
the
rank-and-file
employee
who
decides
“i
need
the
money,
i’m
going
back
to
work”.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
it
is
a
completely
different
case.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
situation
was
presented
in
illinois
bell.
at
page
286
of
the
appendix,
union
representative
cunningham
was
asked
what
about
supervisors
who
were
charged
with
violating
union’s
constitution,
but
who
it
turns
out
only
performs
supervisory
duties.
and
the
answer
was
the
charges
were
dropped
against
those
members.
if
they
are
--
you
see,
the
situation
is
not
quite
a
simple
as
the
seventh
circuit
would
have
it
here.
often
during
a
strike,
there
are
employees
working.
some
of
the
regular
employees
may
decide
to
continue
working
or
return
to
work.
replacements
maybe
higher.
in
a
case
such
as
illinois
bell
where
the
employer
is
part
of
the
largest
system,
employees
are
brought
in
from
other
locations
in
that
system.
so
that
often,
there
are
employees
to
supervise.
at
least
in
illinois
bell,
some
of
those
employees
were
supervised
and
a
supervisor
member
who
did
only
that
was
simply
not
disciplined.
so
we
definitely
draw
that
distinction.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
because
when
a
supervisor
is
in
fact
directing
the
work
force,
doing
what
he
normally
does,
he
is
performing
at
the
very
least,
a
supervisory
duty
as
that
is
defined
in
2
(11).
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
oakland
mailers?
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
very
reluctant.
i
think
it
is
wrong
mr.
justice
white,
but
no
union
has
succeeded
in
convincing
any
court
of
that.
so
i
am
load
to
try
to
convince
this
court
when
we
can
succeed
on
a
narrower
ground.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
to
use
the
board’s
word
would
be
interfering
with
the
right
of
the
employer
to
have
this
loyalty
which
we
do
not
believe
fits
within
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
at
all,
but
if
it
does,
it
certainly
fits
no
further
than
that.
basically
what
the
board
and
florida
power
argue
here,
we
submit,
is
a
policy
question.
and
we
submit
in
return
that
what
is
involved
here
is
not
whether
the
policy
which
underlies
these
decisions
is
a
good
one
or
a
bad
one
or
what
the
law
should
be,
but
whether
it
was
in
fact
what
congress
intended.
we
submit
that
both
the
language
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
its
legislative
history,
and
even
the
legislative
history
of
2
(3),
2
(11),
and
14
(a)
show
no
support
for
the
board’s
position
that
congress
made
this
specific
act
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
and
we
think
on
that
basis
alone
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
but
there
is
an
additional
reason.
the
effect
of
the
board’s
expansive
reading
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
here
is
to
intrude
directly
into
the
area
of
regulation
of
economic
weapons.
that
flies
in
the
phase
of
section
13
of
the
act,
it
is
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
told
the
board
on
past
occasions,
particularly
in
insurance
agents
and
in
the
curtis
brothers
case,
drivers
local
union,
639,
where
the
board
similarly
tried
to
expand
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and
the
court,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
said
“you
may
not
do
that,
we
have
to
stick
with
what
congress
enacted
even
if
the
board
thinks
it’s
a
better
system.”
it
relied
on
section
13,
it
relied
on
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
admonition
which
is
certainly
pertinent
here
that
the
act
was
very
much
the
result
of
conflicting
pressures
and
of
compromise,
and
that
expansive
readings
are
not
to
be
given
to
sections
even
if
their
language
is
ambiguous.
we
submit,
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
does
not
have
ambiguous
language
to
begin
with.
now,
the
economic
weapon,
of
course,
that
would
be
diminished
here
is
the
same
weapon
that
was
involved
in
allis-chalmers.
as
this
court
said
in
allis-chalmers,
at
pages
181,
182,
“the
economic
strike
against
the
employer
is
the
ultimate
weapon
in
labor’s
arsenal
for
achieving
agreement
upon
its
terms.
and
the
power
to
fine
or
expel
strike
breakers
is
essential
if
the
union
is
to
be
an
effective
bargaining
agent.”
and
of
course
those
principles
were
re-affirmed
last
term
in
the
boeing
decision.
and
as
the
court
below
concluded
in
all
relevant
respects,
the
allis-chalmers
decision
is
indistinguishable
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
union’s
interest
is
just
as
valid,
it
is
just
as
great.
the
employer
has
the
economic
weapon
of
trying
to
use
his
supervisors
as
strike
breakers.
the
union
has
its
right
if
they
are
members
to
discipline
them
for
doing
so.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
the
employer
in
this
case
says
--
first
of
all,
you
know
we
are
caught
in
the
middle,
and
we
say
to
that,
you
are
not
at
all
caught
in
the
middle;
you
have
an
absolute
right
under
the
act
to
say
to
your
supervisors,
get
out
of
the
union;
you
may
not
stay
in
the
union.
and
to
say
to
the
union,
these
supervisors
are
now
beyond
your
control.
and
it’s
interesting
to
note,
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
and
occurred
since
the
record
in
this
case
that
during
the
last
florida
power
&
light
strike,
this
past
winter,
the
company
directed
all
of
its
supervisors
to
resign
from
the
union
and
in
fact,
they
did
so.
so
the
employer
has
so
to
speak
the
ultimate
weapon
in
that
respect
simply
by
exercising
the
option
open
to
it
which
was
the
precise
remedy
which
congress
gave
it
in
14
(a).
and
i
think
it
is
also
instructed
to
note
what
happened
in
the
illinois
bell
case
following
the
strike.
at
footnote
31
of
our
brief
which
is
at
page
61,
we
point
out
that
in
1971,
the
strike
was
in
1968,
the
parties
again
sat
down
at
the
bargaining
table,
and
the
employer
specifically
waived
its
right
to
make
any
effort
whatever
to
force
the
supervisors
out
of
the
union.
and
it
did
so
for
a
very
practical
reason.
it
got
a
very
substantive
and
substantial
concession
from
the
union
concerning
the
jurisdictional
claims
of
the
union.
that,
we
submit,
was
the
process
which
congress
intended
that
the
parties
would
work
out
with
the
employer
having
the
ultimate
say
“what
the
status
of
his
supervisors
would
be.”
in
these
cases
for
varying
reasons,
the
employers
decided
to
let
their
supervisors
remain
in
the
union.
in
the
illinois
bell
case,
i
know
we
can
point
to
something
specific.
they’ve
got
benefit
in
exchange
for.
they
bargained
it
out.
but
it
is
an
impermissible
jump
to
go
from
there
to
say
that
when
the
employer
and
nevertheless
says
they
can
stay
in
the
union.
and
of
course,
as
members
are
subject
to
union
control
that
it
suddenly
becomes
a
violation
of
this
narrowly
drawn
section.
if
the
union
follows
its
traditional
practice
which
this
court
noted
in
allis-chalmers
existed
along
before
taft
of
disciplining
them
for
the
basic
violation
of
strike
breaking.
if
the
court
has
no
question,
mr.
gold
will
precede
with
the
argument.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
just
have
one
or
two
brief
comments.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
yes,
that’s
what
i
intended
to
address
myself
to.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
impairment
of
the
right
to
strike
in
the
impermissible
sense
or
to
use
mr.
justice
stewart’s
point,
that
is
the
issue
here.
in
allis-chalmers,
what
you
had
was
the
right
of
the
union
to
discipline
the
employee
members
for
breaking
the
strike.
there
is
an
old
question
that
the
right
to
maintain
the
solidarity
of
employee
members
is
very
vital
to
the
right
to
strike.
however,
what
you
have
here
is
the
discipline
of
supervisor
members
and
supervisory
personnel
have
not
traditionally
been
picket
line
allies
of
the
rank-and-file,
rather
as
the
dissent
in
packard
noted,
in
industrial
conflicts
they’re
allied
with
management.
so,
therefore,
in
reading
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
to
the
way
the
board
has
in
this
case,
you
are
not
impairing
the
union’s
interest
to
the
same
extent
as
you
would,
had
you
read
allis
to
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
to
prohibit
them
from
finding
or
disciplining
employee
strike
breakers.
on
the
other
hand,
to
fail
to
read
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
as
the
board
has
done
here,
would
substantially
impair
the
employer’s
interest,
which
congress
clearly
intended
to
protect,
namely,
of
ensuring
the
undivided
loyalty
of
its
supervisors
during
a
strike
no
less
than
at
any
other
time.
now,
i
think
that
the
union’s
concession
that
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
can
be
read
to
encompass
the
oakland
mailers
situation.
carry
this
a
long
way,
along
the
road
to
sustaining
the
board’s
position,
because
it
shows
that
congress
did
not,
as
the
union
argues
in
much
of
its
brief
and
as
the
court
below,
the
majority
argued
in
much
of
its
opinion,
intend
to
leave
the
employer
only
with
the
option
of
insisting
that
his
supervisors
get
out
of
the
union.
if
they
didn’t
get
out
of
the
union,
he
then
have
to
accept
divided
loyalty
because
the
--
if
oakland
mailers
is
correct,
the
employer
is
protected
against
union
discipline
which
interferes
with
the
performance
of
that
supervisor’s
management
functions.
and
the
question
that
we
then
come
down
to
is
whether
or
not
the
board
is
reasonable
in
concluding
that
the
performance
of
rank-and-file
work
during
a
strike
is
a
proper
function
that
management
can
require
of
its
supervisors
and
whether
to
discipline
them
for
that
--
performance
of
that
function
is
likely
to
have
a
spillover
effect
that
is
going
to
impair
of
that
supervisor’s
performance
of
grievance
adjustment
and
other
duties.
we
submit
that
the
board
was
reasonable
in
so
concluding,
even
though,
another
conclusion
might
have
been
equally
reasonable,
and
therefore,
the
board
should
be
sustained
in
these
cases.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
come
has
spoken
of
the
practicalities.
he
has
said
the
effects
of
these
cases
as
a
practical
matter.
we
submit
that
what
these
cases
involve
is
not
a
practical
matter
but
a
statutory
matter.
we
view
the
controlling
question
here
as
one
of
congressional
intentions
specifically.
is
there
anything
in
either
the
language
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
or
its
legislative
history
that
shows
that
congress
ever
contemplated
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
that
section,
for
a
union
to
fine
its
members
who
are
supervisors
with
the
consent
of
the
employer,
for
engaging
in
strike
bridging.
the
language
of
the
section
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
is
quite
clear,
it’s
unambiguous,
it’s
narrow.
the
senate
report
which
we
have
sited
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief,
also
shows
that
congress
intended
no
greater
reach
for
that
section
in
its
words
canoe.
it
speaks
of
forcing
employers
in
or
out
of
employer
associations
and
it
says
also,
this
section
would
not
permit
a
union
to
dictate
who
shall
represent
an
employer
in
the
settlement
of
employee
grievances
or
to
compel
an
employer
--
to
compel
the
removal
of
a
personnel
director
or
supervisor
who
has
been
delegated
the
function
of
settling
grievances.
the
remarks
of
senators
taft
and
ellender
which
we’ve
sited
in
the
page
16
of
our
brief,
again
show
that
that
is
all
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
and
in
fact,
in
professing
his
description
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
senator
taft
said
that
the
section
was
not
“perhaps
of
tremendous
importance.”
there
is
simply
nothing
that
the
board
can
point
to,
to
show
that
congress
was
thinking
of
the
discipline
of
supervisors
who
are
permitted
to
remain
union
members
when
it
enacted
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
which
deals
with
this
divided
loyalty’s
question.
it
was
obviously
very
much
in
the
mind
of
the
congress
at
that
time
and
congress
spoke
through
sections
2
(3),
2
(11),
and
14
(a).
but
we
think
the
significant
point
is
what
they
did.
congress
did
not
create
an
unfair
labor
practice.
rather
there
were
two
what
we
might
call
extreme
positions
advanced
at
the
time.
one
group
said,
the
foreman
supervisor
should
have
a
chance
to
remain
in
their
own
unions,
perhaps
not
in
employee
unions
but
in
their
own
unions.
another
group
said
it
should
be
outlawed
completely.
and
they
compromise
that
was
struck
said,
it’s
up
to
the
employer
to
decide
what
he
wants
to
let
them
do?
they
were
removed
form
the
definition
of
employee
in
section
2
(3).
they
were
stripped
of
their
rights
under
the
act
and
they
were
allowed
to
remain
union
members
only
of
the
sufferings
of
their
employer.
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
which
the
other
side
can
point
which
shows
that
congress
intended
to
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
supervisors
were
to
remain
in
the
union,
or
once
they
were
allowed
to
remain
and
were
subject
to
the
same
union
rules
as
other
members,
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
that
is
what
we
think
congress
intended.
yes.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
we
think
that
is
precisely
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
all
that
it
had
in
mind.
now,
we
are
confronted
with
that
argument
when
we
are
here.
well
what
about
the
effect
of
this
so-called
evolution
of
cases
since
oakland
mailers
in
1968.
of
course,
we
know
as
this
court
observed
yesterday
in
its
bell
aerospace
decision
once
again
that
it’s
always
significant
to
look
at
what
the
board
has
done
for
20
or
25
years
in
assessing
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
however,
we
also
recognize
that
no
court
of
appeals
has
accepted
the
argument
today,
that
even
the
oakland
mailers
doctrine
steps
beyond
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
because
it
affects
more
than
the
selection,
the
identity
question.
but
as
the
court
below
held,
even
if
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
is
read
more
broadly
as
the
board
has
read
it
in
oakland
mailers,
it
still
has
to
have
some
relationship
to
the
performance
of
an
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
function,
which
is
either
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment.
or
at
the
very
least,
what
the
board
has
second
step
stretched
it
to,
to
include
the
performance
of
some
supervisory
duty
as
they
are
defined
in
section
2
(11).
you
see
there,
the
board
has
preceded
gradually
--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
our
principal
position
here
does
not,
mr.
justice
white.
we
do
believe
that
the
oakland
mailers
doctrine
actually
step
beyond
the
intention
of
congress
and
if
that
is
so
and
if
the
court
should
so
decide,
then
yes
even
that
would
be
outside
of
the
reach
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
but
we
take
a
narrower
position
here
as
did
the
court
below
that
even
if
oakland
mailers
is
correct
in
saying
that
anytime
the
employer
is
engaged
in
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
function,
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment,
or
a
supervisory
duty
then
the
union
may
not
touch
him.
we
are
willing
to
go
that
far
even
though
we
think
that’s
beyond
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
we
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
congress
intended
to
read
the
board
completely
out
of
the
picture.
now,
let
me
explain
that.
congress
deprived
the
supervisor
both
of
his
status
as
an
employee
and
of
any
rights
under
the
act.
in
the
words
of
senator
taft,
they
were
“generally
restored
to
the
basis
which
they
enjoyed
before
the
passage
of
the
wagner
act.”
it
was
clear
from
the
debates
that
congress
was
concerned
that
the
board
was
lending
its
processes
to
the
organization
of
supervisors.
and
it
not
only
read
that
the
supervisor
out
of
the
protection
of
the
act,
but
it
read
the
board
out
of
the
picture.
it
said
we
are
going
to
leave
this
to
the
employer,
he
can
strike
an
agreement
with
the
union
at
the
bargaining
table
if
he
wants
to
permit
them
to
retain
union
membership
but
he
doesn’t
have
to.
and
in
that
sense,
the
only
thing
that
congress
did
was
to
give
the
employer
the
leeway
to
decide.
and
we
believe
it
intended
to
keep
the
board
out
of
the
business
of
regulating
supervisory
activities
or
the
relationship
of
the
union
to
its
supervisors.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
of
that
there
is
absolutely
no
question.
that’s
correct.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
which
is,
as
we
submit,
a
very
narrowly
defined
unfair
labor
practice,
but
we
are
taking
the
principal
position
here,
and
i
am
certainly
willing
to
argue
it
on
that
basis
that
the
board
may
prohibit
under
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
the
imposition
of
union
rules
on
supervisors
when
they
are
functioning
as
supervisors
or
as
a
management
agent.
but
as
the
court
below
held
to
say
that
the
performance
of
rank-and-file
work,
in
the
course
of
a
strike
is
somehow
an
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
duty
or
a
2
(11)
function.
it
is
like
saying
black
is
white.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
it
does
not.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
representative
for
two
purposes,
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
under
insurance
agents,
it
is
true
that
a
strike
he
is
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
but
that
is
not
enough,
we
submit,
to
read
this
activity
into
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
a
strike
is
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
obviously
a
supervisor
who
returns
to
work
aides
the
employer.
but
so
as
the
rank-and-file
employee
who
decides
“i
need
the
money,
i’m
going
back
to
work”.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
it
is
a
completely
different
case.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
situation
was
presented
in
illinois
bell.
at
page
286
of
the
appendix,
union
representative
cunningham
was
asked
what
about
supervisors
who
were
charged
with
violating
union’s
constitution,
but
who
it
turns
out
only
performs
supervisory
duties.
and
the
answer
was
the
charges
were
dropped
against
those
members.
if
they
are
--
you
see,
the
situation
is
not
quite
a
simple
as
the
seventh
circuit
would
have
it
here.
often
during
a
strike,
there
are
employees
working.
some
of
the
regular
employees
may
decide
to
continue
working
or
return
to
work.
replacements
maybe
higher.
in
a
case
such
as
illinois
bell
where
the
employer
is
part
of
the
largest
system,
employees
are
brought
in
from
other
locations
in
that
system.
so
that
often,
there
are
employees
to
supervise.
at
least
in
illinois
bell,
some
of
those
employees
were
supervised
and
a
supervisor
member
who
did
only
that
was
simply
not
disciplined.
so
we
definitely
draw
that
distinction.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
because
when
a
supervisor
is
in
fact
directing
the
work
force,
doing
what
he
normally
does,
he
is
performing
at
the
very
least,
a
supervisory
duty
as
that
is
defined
in
2
(11).
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
oakland
mailers?
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
very
reluctant.
i
think
it
is
wrong
mr.
justice
white,
but
no
union
has
succeeded
in
convincing
any
court
of
that.
so
i
am
load
to
try
to
convince
this
court
when
we
can
succeed
on
a
narrower
ground.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
to
use
the
board’s
word
would
be
interfering
with
the
right
of
the
employer
to
have
this
loyalty
which
we
do
not
believe
fits
within
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
at
all,
but
if
it
does,
it
certainly
fits
no
further
than
that.
basically
what
the
board
and
florida
power
argue
here,
we
submit,
is
a
policy
question.
and
we
submit
in
return
that
what
is
involved
here
is
not
whether
the
policy
which
underlies
these
decisions
is
a
good
one
or
a
bad
one
or
what
the
law
should
be,
but
whether
it
was
in
fact
what
congress
intended.
we
submit
that
both
the
language
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
its
legislative
history,
and
even
the
legislative
history
of
2
(3),
2
(11),
and
14
(a)
show
no
support
for
the
board’s
position
that
congress
made
this
specific
act
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
and
we
think
on
that
basis
alone
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
but
there
is
an
additional
reason.
the
effect
of
the
board’s
expansive
reading
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
here
is
to
intrude
directly
into
the
area
of
regulation
of
economic
weapons.
that
flies
in
the
phase
of
section
13
of
the
act,
it
is
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
told
the
board
on
past
occasions,
particularly
in
insurance
agents
and
in
the
curtis
brothers
case,
drivers
local
union,
639,
where
the
board
similarly
tried
to
expand
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and
the
court,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
said
“you
may
not
do
that,
we
have
to
stick
with
what
congress
enacted
even
if
the
board
thinks
it’s
a
better
system.”
it
relied
on
section
13,
it
relied
on
mr.
justice
frankfurter’s
admonition
which
is
certainly
pertinent
here
that
the
act
was
very
much
the
result
of
conflicting
pressures
and
of
compromise,
and
that
expansive
readings
are
not
to
be
given
to
sections
even
if
their
language
is
ambiguous.
we
submit,
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
does
not
have
ambiguous
language
to
begin
with.
now,
the
economic
weapon,
of
course,
that
would
be
diminished
here
is
the
same
weapon
that
was
involved
in
allis-chalmers.
as
this
court
said
in
allis-chalmers,
at
pages
181,
182,
“the
economic
strike
against
the
employer
is
the
ultimate
weapon
in
labor’s
arsenal
for
achieving
agreement
upon
its
terms.
and
the
power
to
fine
or
expel
strike
breakers
is
essential
if
the
union
is
to
be
an
effective
bargaining
agent.”
and
of
course
those
principles
were
re-affirmed
last
term
in
the
boeing
decision.
and
as
the
court
below
concluded
in
all
relevant
respects,
the
allis-chalmers
decision
is
indistinguishable
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
union’s
interest
is
just
as
valid,
it
is
just
as
great.
the
employer
has
the
economic
weapon
of
trying
to
use
his
supervisors
as
strike
breakers.
the
union
has
its
right
if
they
are
members
to
discipline
them
for
doing
so.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
the
employer
in
this
case
says
--
first
of
all,
you
know
we
are
caught
in
the
middle,
and
we
say
to
that,
you
are
not
at
all
caught
in
the
middle;
you
have
an
absolute
right
under
the
act
to
say
to
your
supervisors,
get
out
of
the
union;
you
may
not
stay
in
the
union.
and
to
say
to
the
union,
these
supervisors
are
now
beyond
your
control.
and
it’s
interesting
to
note,
although
it
is
not
in
the
record
and
occurred
since
the
record
in
this
case
that
during
the
last
florida
power
&
light
strike,
this
past
winter,
the
company
directed
all
of
its
supervisors
to
resign
from
the
union
and
in
fact,
they
did
so.
so
the
employer
has
so
to
speak
the
ultimate
weapon
in
that
respect
simply
by
exercising
the
option
open
to
it
which
was
the
precise
remedy
which
congress
gave
it
in
14
(a).
and
i
think
it
is
also
instructed
to
note
what
happened
in
the
illinois
bell
case
following
the
strike.
at
footnote
31
of
our
brief
which
is
at
page
61,
we
point
out
that
in
1971,
the
strike
was
in
1968,
the
parties
again
sat
down
at
the
bargaining
table,
and
the
employer
specifically
waived
its
right
to
make
any
effort
whatever
to
force
the
supervisors
out
of
the
union.
and
it
did
so
for
a
very
practical
reason.
it
got
a
very
substantive
and
substantial
concession
from
the
union
concerning
the
jurisdictional
claims
of
the
union.
that,
we
submit,
was
the
process
which
congress
intended
that
the
parties
would
work
out
with
the
employer
having
the
ultimate
say
“what
the
status
of
his
supervisors
would
be.”
in
these
cases
for
varying
reasons,
the
employers
decided
to
let
their
supervisors
remain
in
the
union.
in
the
illinois
bell
case,
i
know
we
can
point
to
something
specific.
they’ve
got
benefit
in
exchange
for.
they
bargained
it
out.
but
it
is
an
impermissible
jump
to
go
from
there
to
say
that
when
the
employer
and
nevertheless
says
they
can
stay
in
the
union.
and
of
course,
as
members
are
subject
to
union
control
that
it
suddenly
becomes
a
violation
of
this
narrowly
drawn
section.
if
the
union
follows
its
traditional
practice
which
this
court
noted
in
allis-chalmers
existed
along
before
taft
of
disciplining
them
for
the
basic
violation
of
strike
breaking.
if
the
court
has
no
question,
mr.
gold
will
precede
with
the
argument.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
just
have
one
or
two
brief
comments.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
yes,
that’s
what
i
intended
to
address
myself
to.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
impairment
of
the
right
to
strike
in
the
impermissible
sense
or
to
use
mr.
justice
stewart’s
point,
that
is
the
issue
here.
in
allis-chalmers,
what
you
had
was
the
right
of
the
union
to
discipline
the
employee
members
for
breaking
the
strike.
there
is
an
old
question
that
the
right
to
maintain
the
solidarity
of
employee
members
is
very
vital
to
the
right
to
strike.
however,
what
you
have
here
is
the
discipline
of
supervisor
members
and
supervisory
personnel
have
not
traditionally
been
picket
line
allies
of
the
rank-and-file,
rather
as
the
dissent
in
packard
noted,
in
industrial
conflicts
they’re
allied
with
management.
so,
therefore,
in
reading
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
to
the
way
the
board
has
in
this
case,
you
are
not
impairing
the
union’s
interest
to
the
same
extent
as
you
would,
had
you
read
allis
to
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
to
prohibit
them
from
finding
or
disciplining
employee
strike
breakers.
on
the
other
hand,
to
fail
to
read
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
as
the
board
has
done
here,
would
substantially
impair
the
employer’s
interest,
which
congress
clearly
intended
to
protect,
namely,
of
ensuring
the
undivided
loyalty
of
its
supervisors
during
a
strike
no
less
than
at
any
other
time.
now,
i
think
that
the
union’s
concession
that
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
can
be
read
to
encompass
the
oakland
mailers
situation.
carry
this
a
long
way,
along
the
road
to
sustaining
the
board’s
position,
because
it
shows
that
congress
did
not,
as
the
union
argues
in
much
of
its
brief
and
as
the
court
below,
the
majority
argued
in
much
of
its
opinion,
intend
to
leave
the
employer
only
with
the
option
of
insisting
that
his
supervisors
get
out
of
the
union.
if
they
didn’t
get
out
of
the
union,
he
then
have
to
accept
divided
loyalty
because
the
--
if
oakland
mailers
is
correct,
the
employer
is
protected
against
union
discipline
which
interferes
with
the
performance
of
that
supervisor’s
management
functions.
and
the
question
that
we
then
come
down
to
is
whether
or
not
the
board
is
reasonable
in
concluding
that
the
performance
of
rank-and-file
work
during
a
strike
is
a
proper
function
that
management
can
require
of
its
supervisors
and
whether
to
discipline
them
for
that
--
performance
of
that
function
is
likely
to
have
a
spillover
effect
that
is
going
to
impair
of
that
supervisor’s
performance
of
grievance
adjustment
and
other
duties.
we
submit
that
the
board
was
reasonable
in
so
concluding,
even
though,
another
conclusion
might
have
been
equally
reasonable,
and
therefore,
the
board
should
be
sustained
in
these
cases.
