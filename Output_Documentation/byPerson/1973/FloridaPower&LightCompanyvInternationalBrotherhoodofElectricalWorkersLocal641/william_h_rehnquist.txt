could

in

strike,
you
had
a
group
of
rank-and-file
employees
who
cross
the

me
that

possible

with
your
position
is
if
you
read
the
language
very
narrowly
and
say
that
the
board
has
virtually
no
power
to
expand
on
it.
that
leaves
you
way
back
before
oakland
mailers.
that
may
be
a
perfectly
tenable
position,
but
if
you
say
the
board
has
some
power
to
expand
on
it
and
can
go
as
far
as
oakland
mailers,
it
seems
to
me,
if
it’s
rather
hard
to
say
why
they
shouldn’t
go
the
last
step.
