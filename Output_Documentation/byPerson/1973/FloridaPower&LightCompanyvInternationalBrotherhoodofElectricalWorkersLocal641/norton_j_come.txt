mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
i
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
hereon
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
in
a
5:4
en
banc
decision,
denied
enforcement
of
the
board’s
orders
directed
against
respondent
unions.
the
basic
question
is
whether
a
union
violates
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
act
which
bars
a
union
from
restraining
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
by
disciplining
supervisors
with
such
duties
who
are
union
members
for
crossing
a
picket
line
during
an
economic
strike
against
the
employer
and
performing
work
which
would
ordinarily
have
been
done
by
the
striking
employees.
there
are
two
cases
here
which
were
consolidated
in
the
court
of
appeals,
florida
power
and
illinois
bell.
the
facts
are
essentially
similar
and
i
shall
outline
them
briefly.
both
illinois
bell
and
florida
power
are
utility
companies
which
have
collective
bargaining
contracts
with
locals
of
the
ibew.
the
bargaining
unit
covered
by
the
contracts
includes
rank-and-file
employees
and
some
supervisory
employees,
both
of
whom
are
union
members.
in
florida
power
union
membership
was
voluntary,
in
illinois
bell,
the
contract
contained
a
union
security
clause
which
required
unit
employees
to
become
and
remain
members
of
the
union
to
the
extent
of
paying
dues
and
fees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
is
arguing
both
cases.
the
board’s
petition
sought
review
of
both,
the
decision
in
florida
power
and
illinois
bell.
the
company
florida
power
filed
a
petition
which
covers
just
florida
power,
but
both
cases
are
up
here
on
the
board’s
petition.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
was
a
grant
of
the
board’s
petition
which
covered
both
illinois
bell
and
florida
power.
there
was
a
grant
of
the
company’s
petition
in
florida
power.
so
both
cases
are
up
here
on
the
board’s
petition.
other
supervisors
of
a
higher
level,
for
example,
district
supervisor,
plant
supervisor,
were
not
covered
by
the
collective
agreement.
the
companies
however
permitted
the
supervisors
to
retain
their
union
membership
and
many
of
them
did.
some
of
these
were
not
active
union
members
but
held
honorary
withdrawal
cards
from
their
respective
locals
which
entitle
them
to
rejoin
the
locals
at
any
time
without
paying
an
initiation
fee,
and
to
apply
for
pension
benefits.
in
addition,
they
entitle
them
to
union
death
benefits.
members
with
withdrawal
cards
however
remain
obligated
to
abide
by
the
union’s
rules
and
are
subjected
to
discipline
if
they
do
not.
both
companies
were
struck
of
a
new
contract
terms
and
picket
lines
were
set
up
in
front
of
the
plants.
the
company
try
to
maintain
operations
with
their
supervisors.
the
record
does
not
show
what
directions
florida
power
gave
to
its
supervisors.
it
does
show
that
illinois
bell
informed
its
supervisors
that
it
would
like
them
to
work
but
that
the
decision
would
be
left
to
each
supervisor.
the
union,
in
illinois
bell,
warned
the
supervisor
members
that
they
would
be
subject
to
discipline
if
they
perform
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike.
both
supervisors,
in
the
contract
unit
and
those
outside
the
unit,
cross
the
picket
line
and
performed
work
including
work
that
would
normally
have
been
performed
by
the
rank-and-file
striking
employees.
after
the
strike,
the
union
disciplined
those
supervisor
members
who
would
perform
a
rank-and-file
work.
in
florida
power,
they
were
fined
in
amounts
of
ranging
from
$100
to
$6,000
and
many
of
them
were
also
expelled
from
membership
in
their
respective
locals.
and
in
illinois
bell,
the
discipline
consisted
in
most
cases
of
$500
fines
which
were
enforceable
by
court’s
suit.
charges
were
filed
with
the
board
alleging
that
the
discipline
of
the
supervisor
members
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes?
mr.
norton
j.
come
what’s
that
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
different
locals
of
the
ibew.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
same
international
is
involved
in
the
--
they
belong
to
the
same
international.
the
international
is
a
party
in
illinois
bell.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
party
in
florida
power.
the
board
found
that
all
of
the
supervisors,
whose
discipline
was
at
issue,
were
not
only
supervisors
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
(11)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
were
management
representatives
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
i.e.,
they
had
grievance
adjustment
and/or
collective
bargaining
functions.
the
board
with
one
member
dissenting
held
that
the
unions
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
by
disciplining
those
supervisors
for
performing
a
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike,
and
entered
an
appropriate
remedial
order.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
in
a
5:4
decision,
declined
to
enforce
the
board’s
orders.
now,
we
start
with
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
act
which,
as
i
indicated,
mixed
at
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
now
there’s
no
question
that
this
clearly
prescribes
direct
union
pressure
of
an
employer,
for
example
is
strike
threat,
to
force
it
to
change
the
identity
of
its
chosen
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment
representative.
now
in
oakland
mailers,
decided
in
1968,
the
board,
for
the
first
time,
was
confronted
with
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
would
also
cover
the
indirect
pressure
that
results
from
union
discipline
of
a
supervisor
member
who
has
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment
functions
for
the
manner
in
which
he
performs
those
duties.
and
the
board
concluded
that
it
did
on
the
theory
that
such
discipline
would
tend
to
make
the
supervisor
responsive
or
subservient
to
the
union’s
will
and
thereby
deprive
the
employer
of
his
full
allegiants.
so
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
employer
would
either
after
replace
that
supervisor
or
the
call
to
board
face
the
fact
to
all
non-representation
by
him.
now
the
court
below
agrees,
although
the
union
does
not,
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
may
properly
be
construed
to
interdict
such
indirect
pressure
on
the
employer.
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
although
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
speaks
literally
in
terms
of
coercing
the
selection
of
employer
or
representatives,
it
is
clear
that
management’s
right
to
a
free
selection
would
be
hollow
indeed.
and
i’m
quoting
for
the
court
“if
the
union
could
dictate
the
matter
in
which
the
selected
representative
performed
his
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment
functions.”
now,
the
court
below,
however,
that
is
the
majority
of
the
court,
concluded
that
this
reasoning
does
not
all
true
whereas
here
a
supervisor
is
disciplined
for
performing
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike.
and
the
court’s
argument
is
that
when
a
supervisor
forsakes
his
supervisory
role
to
do
rank-and-file
work,
he
is
no
longer
acting
as
a
management
representative.
and
that
there’s
a
clear-cut
dividing
line
between
supervisory
and
non-supervisory
work,
and
accordingly,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
by
being
forced
to
take
sides
with
the
union,
a
supervisor
will
suffer
from
a
change
of
attitude
when
after
the
strike
he
returns
to
his
normal
supervisory
duties.
now,
we
submit,
as
the
dissenting
judges
below
correctly
observed
the
position
of
the
majority
of
the
court
below
reflects
on
unrealistic
view
of
the
role
of
the
strike
in
the
collective
bargaining
process,
because
just
as
a
union
seeks
to
strengthen
its
hand
at
the
bargaining
table
by
bringing
the
company’s
operations
to
a
halt,
so
management
in
order
to
hold
out
for
the
terms
it
wants,
seeks
to
counter
this
pressure
by
keeping
operations
going,
and
the
performance
of
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike
by
supervisors
and
other
management
representatives
is
a
vital
part
of
such
a
company
effort.
so
that
insofar
as
the
supervisor
is
called
upon
by
the
employer
to
assist
him
in
keeping
the
plant
running.
he
is
acting
as
a
management
representative
and
to
discipline
him
for
such
activity,
we
submit,
the
board
could
reasonably
conclude,
could
have
a
lingering
effect
that
would
affect
the
future
performance
of
his
supervisory
duties.
now,
this
reading
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
we
submit,
furthers
congress’s
intention
with
respect
to
the
status
of
the
supervisory
employees
under
the
act.
only
yesterday
this
court
in
the
bell
aerospace
decision
noted
the
fact
that
in
1947,
congress
sought
to
assure
employers
of
the
undivided
loyalty
of
their
supervisors
which
it
believed
had
been
jeopardized
by
this
court’s
holding
in
packard
that
foremen
were
employees
under
the
wagner
act
and
constituted
an
appropriate
unit
for
collective
bargaining.
congress
believe
that
the
inclusion
of
supervisors
into
organization’s
composed
of
or
subservient
to
the
man
that
they
supervised
tended
to
blur
the
line
between
management
and
laborer,
and
to
upset
the
balance
of
collective
bargaining.
and
congress,
the
legislative
history
indicates,
was
concerned
about
this
result
during
a
strike
no
less
than
in
other
times,
because
there’s
repeated
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
fact
that
even
when
foremen
organized
in
a
union
of
their
own,
they
were
nonetheless
in
a
strike
situation
subservient
to
the
rank-and-file
unions.
that
the
foremen’s
association
had
indeed
adopted
a
formal
policy,
forbidding
its
members
when
the
rank-and-file
union
struck
--
to
enter
to
struck
plants
and
protect
and
maintain
them
without
the
concurrence
of
the
rank-and-file.
now,
congress,
in
effort
to
restore
this
balance,
excluded
through
supervisors
from
the
definition
of
the
employee
enhanced
from
the
protection
of
the
act.
and
this
relieve
the
employer
of
the
obligation
recognized
in
packard
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
union
representing
its
supervisors,
and
also
to
insist
that
the
supervisors,
under
pain
of
discharge,
leave
the
union.
now,
this
insistence
however,
namely
that
the
supervisors
leave
the
union,
is
not
practicable
in
many
industries,
such
as
the
construction
industry,
the
printing
industry
and
the
utility
industry
here
where
rank-and-file
employees
are
highly
organized.
supervisors
are
picked
from
the
rank-and-file
and
they’re
unwilling
to
give
up
their
union
membership,
because
this
could
result
in
the
forfeiture
of
substantial
pension
and
other
benefits.
and
moreover,
they
may
return
to
rank-and-file
status
in
the
future.
on
some
jobs,
they
may
be
supervisor
in
other
jobs
or
rank-and-file
worker.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
may
nevertheless
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
may.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
may
but
the
practicalities
are
that
in
these
industries,
if
he
is
strong
enough
to
do
that,
he
may
not
get
a
contract
or
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
or
he
might
not
be
able
to
find
other
supervisors.
so
where
you
have
this
situation
and
the
supervisors
remain
union
members
subjecting
them
to
union
discipline
for
the
performance
of
their
supervisory
functions
tends
to
create
the
very
conflict
of
loyally
and
dilution
of
managerial
authority
problems
which
congress
sought
to
avoid.
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
submit
that
during
a
strike,
whatever
the
supervisor
is
called
upon
to
perform
his
part
of
his
normal
supervisory
or
management
functions,
because
during
a
strike,
the
supervisor
is
called
upon
to
help
out
in
any
way
that
the
--
that
is
necessary
to
keep
the
plant
going.
and
he
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
will
be
acting
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
true
but
he
is
caught
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea,
because
unlike
a
regular
employee
you
cannot
be
discharged
for
striking
a
supervisor,
he
is
a
management
representative
and
his
first
loyalty,
at
least
this
was
congress’s
intention
in
amending
the
act
in
47,
is
supposed
to
be
to
the
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
we
submit
that
that
upsets
the
balance
that
congress
drew
in
1947.
now
in
the
situation
where
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
yes
they
could;
yes
they
could.
but
i
think
that
the
unions
have
ordinarily
not
done
that.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that,
that’s
a
more
accurate
way
of
putting
it
mr.
justice
stewart.
is
the
seventh
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
wisconsin
electric
case,
which
is
pending
hereon
certiorari,
but
the
court
sustained
the
board
that
what
is
supervisory
duties
is
blurred
during
the
strike
situation,
because
what
a
supervisor’s
normal
duties
are
when
a
total
complement
that
employees
is
at
work,
is
totally
different
from
what
its
duties
maybe
during
the
strike,
when
there
are
few
or
no
employees
are
at
work,
and
it
is,
at
that
time,
whatever
he
is
doing
he
is
doing
as
part
of
management.
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
that
there
is
a
like
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
that
there
is
a
likely
to
be
a
lingering
effect
or
a
spill
over
effect.
at
least
the
employer
could
reasonably
so
fear
that
an
employee,
that
the
supervisor
having
been
subjected
to
this
discipline
for
doing
management’s
bidding
during
the
strike,
can
at
least
feel
under
a
sense
of
constraint
and
shade
things
in
the
union’s
way.
the
next
time
the
confrontation
arises
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
collective
bargaining
includes
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
that
occurs
in
the
grievance
adjustment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
the
adjustment
of
grievances
would
be
at
the
more
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
more
likely.
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
your
honor.
that
is
not
the
way
i
read
the
board’s
history.
the
board
--
to
my
--
the
best
of
my
research
was
not
presented
with
any
cases
involving
this
type
of
indirect
pressure
on
the
employer
that
flows
from
union
discipline
until
1968.
i
think
that
what
happened
is
that
after
this
court
decided
allis-chalmers
in
1967,
the
board
began
to
get
a
flurry
of
cases
involving
union
discipline
of
various
types
and
--
so
that
the
reason
that
this
doctrine
is
late
in
evolving,
is
not
for
the
reason
that
has
been
present
in
many
of
the
cases
that
i
have
recently
argued
before
this
court
that
the
board
has
changed
its
mind
three
or
four
times
over
the
course
of
history.
i
think
that
in
this
situation,
the
problem
just
did
not
arise.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
moot.
yes
your
honor,
it
is
moot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
they’re
in
the
disjunctive;
they
are
in
the
disjunctive.
now,
in
a
situation
where
the
employer
is
not
able
to
insist
that
he
is
--
successfully
that
he
has
employed
a
supervisor
leaving
the
union.
you
have
a
very
big
gap
in
effectuating
congress’s
objective
with
respect
to
supervisors,
unless
you
read
and
interpret
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
as
the
board
has
done.
now
to
be
sure,
the
legislative
history
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
contains
no
indication
that
the
provision
was
going
to
be
so
interpreted.
we
submit
that
this
is
because
congress
focused
on
the
most
obvious
forms
of
union
impairment
of
the
employer
selection
of
his
representative,
namely
the
direct
form
of
pressure.
and
in
these
circumstances,
we
have
the
familiar
problem
of
asking
which
choice
is
at
more
likely
that
congress
would
have
made.
had
it
been
presented
with
this
precise
problem,
and
we
submit
that
the
board
was
reasonable
in
view
of
congresses
clear-cut
intention
to
assure
employers
of
the
undivided
loyalty
of
its
supervisors,
it
would
have
sanctioned
the
interpretation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
that
the
board
has
employed
in
these
cases.
i’d
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
i
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
hereon
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
in
a
5:4
en
banc
decision,
denied
enforcement
of
the
board’s
orders
directed
against
respondent
unions.
the
basic
question
is
whether
a
union
violates
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
act
which
bars
a
union
from
restraining
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
by
disciplining
supervisors
with
such
duties
who
are
union
members
for
crossing
a
picket
line
during
an
economic
strike
against
the
employer
and
performing
work
which
would
ordinarily
have
been
done
by
the
striking
employees.
there
are
two
cases
here
which
were
consolidated
in
the
court
of
appeals,
florida
power
and
illinois
bell.
the
facts
are
essentially
similar
and
i
shall
outline
them
briefly.
both
illinois
bell
and
florida
power
are
utility
companies
which
have
collective
bargaining
contracts
with
locals
of
the
ibew.
the
bargaining
unit
covered
by
the
contracts
includes
rank-and-file
employees
and
some
supervisory
employees,
both
of
whom
are
union
members.
in
florida
power
union
membership
was
voluntary,
in
illinois
bell,
the
contract
contained
a
union
security
clause
which
required
unit
employees
to
become
and
remain
members
of
the
union
to
the
extent
of
paying
dues
and
fees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
is
arguing
both
cases.
the
board’s
petition
sought
review
of
both,
the
decision
in
florida
power
and
illinois
bell.
the
company
florida
power
filed
a
petition
which
covers
just
florida
power,
but
both
cases
are
up
here
on
the
board’s
petition.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
was
a
grant
of
the
board’s
petition
which
covered
both
illinois
bell
and
florida
power.
there
was
a
grant
of
the
company’s
petition
in
florida
power.
so
both
cases
are
up
here
on
the
board’s
petition.
other
supervisors
of
a
higher
level,
for
example,
district
supervisor,
plant
supervisor,
were
not
covered
by
the
collective
agreement.
the
companies
however
permitted
the
supervisors
to
retain
their
union
membership
and
many
of
them
did.
some
of
these
were
not
active
union
members
but
held
honorary
withdrawal
cards
from
their
respective
locals
which
entitle
them
to
rejoin
the
locals
at
any
time
without
paying
an
initiation
fee,
and
to
apply
for
pension
benefits.
in
addition,
they
entitle
them
to
union
death
benefits.
members
with
withdrawal
cards
however
remain
obligated
to
abide
by
the
union’s
rules
and
are
subjected
to
discipline
if
they
do
not.
both
companies
were
struck
of
a
new
contract
terms
and
picket
lines
were
set
up
in
front
of
the
plants.
the
company
try
to
maintain
operations
with
their
supervisors.
the
record
does
not
show
what
directions
florida
power
gave
to
its
supervisors.
it
does
show
that
illinois
bell
informed
its
supervisors
that
it
would
like
them
to
work
but
that
the
decision
would
be
left
to
each
supervisor.
the
union,
in
illinois
bell,
warned
the
supervisor
members
that
they
would
be
subject
to
discipline
if
they
perform
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike.
both
supervisors,
in
the
contract
unit
and
those
outside
the
unit,
cross
the
picket
line
and
performed
work
including
work
that
would
normally
have
been
performed
by
the
rank-and-file
striking
employees.
after
the
strike,
the
union
disciplined
those
supervisor
members
who
would
perform
a
rank-and-file
work.
in
florida
power,
they
were
fined
in
amounts
of
ranging
from
$100
to
$6,000
and
many
of
them
were
also
expelled
from
membership
in
their
respective
locals.
and
in
illinois
bell,
the
discipline
consisted
in
most
cases
of
$500
fines
which
were
enforceable
by
court’s
suit.
charges
were
filed
with
the
board
alleging
that
the
discipline
of
the
supervisor
members
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes?
mr.
norton
j.
come
what’s
that
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
different
locals
of
the
ibew.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
same
international
is
involved
in
the
--
they
belong
to
the
same
international.
the
international
is
a
party
in
illinois
bell.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
party
in
florida
power.
the
board
found
that
all
of
the
supervisors,
whose
discipline
was
at
issue,
were
not
only
supervisors
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
(11)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
were
management
representatives
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
i.e.,
they
had
grievance
adjustment
and/or
collective
bargaining
functions.
the
board
with
one
member
dissenting
held
that
the
unions
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
by
disciplining
those
supervisors
for
performing
a
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike,
and
entered
an
appropriate
remedial
order.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
in
a
5:4
decision,
declined
to
enforce
the
board’s
orders.
now,
we
start
with
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
act
which,
as
i
indicated,
mixed
at
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
now
there’s
no
question
that
this
clearly
prescribes
direct
union
pressure
of
an
employer,
for
example
is
strike
threat,
to
force
it
to
change
the
identity
of
its
chosen
collective
bargaining
or
grievance
adjustment
representative.
now
in
oakland
mailers,
decided
in
1968,
the
board,
for
the
first
time,
was
confronted
with
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
would
also
cover
the
indirect
pressure
that
results
from
union
discipline
of
a
supervisor
member
who
has
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment
functions
for
the
manner
in
which
he
performs
those
duties.
and
the
board
concluded
that
it
did
on
the
theory
that
such
discipline
would
tend
to
make
the
supervisor
responsive
or
subservient
to
the
union’s
will
and
thereby
deprive
the
employer
of
his
full
allegiants.
so
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
employer
would
either
after
replace
that
supervisor
or
the
call
to
board
face
the
fact
to
all
non-representation
by
him.
now
the
court
below
agrees,
although
the
union
does
not,
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
may
properly
be
construed
to
interdict
such
indirect
pressure
on
the
employer.
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
although
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
speaks
literally
in
terms
of
coercing
the
selection
of
employer
or
representatives,
it
is
clear
that
management’s
right
to
a
free
selection
would
be
hollow
indeed.
and
i’m
quoting
for
the
court
“if
the
union
could
dictate
the
matter
in
which
the
selected
representative
performed
his
collective
bargaining
and
grievance
adjustment
functions.”
now,
the
court
below,
however,
that
is
the
majority
of
the
court,
concluded
that
this
reasoning
does
not
all
true
whereas
here
a
supervisor
is
disciplined
for
performing
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike.
and
the
court’s
argument
is
that
when
a
supervisor
forsakes
his
supervisory
role
to
do
rank-and-file
work,
he
is
no
longer
acting
as
a
management
representative.
and
that
there’s
a
clear-cut
dividing
line
between
supervisory
and
non-supervisory
work,
and
accordingly,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
by
being
forced
to
take
sides
with
the
union,
a
supervisor
will
suffer
from
a
change
of
attitude
when
after
the
strike
he
returns
to
his
normal
supervisory
duties.
now,
we
submit,
as
the
dissenting
judges
below
correctly
observed
the
position
of
the
majority
of
the
court
below
reflects
on
unrealistic
view
of
the
role
of
the
strike
in
the
collective
bargaining
process,
because
just
as
a
union
seeks
to
strengthen
its
hand
at
the
bargaining
table
by
bringing
the
company’s
operations
to
a
halt,
so
management
in
order
to
hold
out
for
the
terms
it
wants,
seeks
to
counter
this
pressure
by
keeping
operations
going,
and
the
performance
of
rank-and-file
work
during
the
strike
by
supervisors
and
other
management
representatives
is
a
vital
part
of
such
a
company
effort.
so
that
insofar
as
the
supervisor
is
called
upon
by
the
employer
to
assist
him
in
keeping
the
plant
running.
he
is
acting
as
a
management
representative
and
to
discipline
him
for
such
activity,
we
submit,
the
board
could
reasonably
conclude,
could
have
a
lingering
effect
that
would
affect
the
future
performance
of
his
supervisory
duties.
now,
this
reading
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b),
we
submit,
furthers
congress’s
intention
with
respect
to
the
status
of
the
supervisory
employees
under
the
act.
only
yesterday
this
court
in
the
bell
aerospace
decision
noted
the
fact
that
in
1947,
congress
sought
to
assure
employers
of
the
undivided
loyalty
of
their
supervisors
which
it
believed
had
been
jeopardized
by
this
court’s
holding
in
packard
that
foremen
were
employees
under
the
wagner
act
and
constituted
an
appropriate
unit
for
collective
bargaining.
congress
believe
that
the
inclusion
of
supervisors
into
organization’s
composed
of
or
subservient
to
the
man
that
they
supervised
tended
to
blur
the
line
between
management
and
laborer,
and
to
upset
the
balance
of
collective
bargaining.
and
congress,
the
legislative
history
indicates,
was
concerned
about
this
result
during
a
strike
no
less
than
in
other
times,
because
there’s
repeated
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
fact
that
even
when
foremen
organized
in
a
union
of
their
own,
they
were
nonetheless
in
a
strike
situation
subservient
to
the
rank-and-file
unions.
that
the
foremen’s
association
had
indeed
adopted
a
formal
policy,
forbidding
its
members
when
the
rank-and-file
union
struck
--
to
enter
to
struck
plants
and
protect
and
maintain
them
without
the
concurrence
of
the
rank-and-file.
now,
congress,
in
effort
to
restore
this
balance,
excluded
through
supervisors
from
the
definition
of
the
employee
enhanced
from
the
protection
of
the
act.
and
this
relieve
the
employer
of
the
obligation
recognized
in
packard
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
union
representing
its
supervisors,
and
also
to
insist
that
the
supervisors,
under
pain
of
discharge,
leave
the
union.
now,
this
insistence
however,
namely
that
the
supervisors
leave
the
union,
is
not
practicable
in
many
industries,
such
as
the
construction
industry,
the
printing
industry
and
the
utility
industry
here
where
rank-and-file
employees
are
highly
organized.
supervisors
are
picked
from
the
rank-and-file
and
they’re
unwilling
to
give
up
their
union
membership,
because
this
could
result
in
the
forfeiture
of
substantial
pension
and
other
benefits.
and
moreover,
they
may
return
to
rank-and-file
status
in
the
future.
on
some
jobs,
they
may
be
supervisor
in
other
jobs
or
rank-and-file
worker.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
may
nevertheless
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
may.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
may
but
the
practicalities
are
that
in
these
industries,
if
he
is
strong
enough
to
do
that,
he
may
not
get
a
contract
or
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
or
he
might
not
be
able
to
find
other
supervisors.
so
where
you
have
this
situation
and
the
supervisors
remain
union
members
subjecting
them
to
union
discipline
for
the
performance
of
their
supervisory
functions
tends
to
create
the
very
conflict
of
loyally
and
dilution
of
managerial
authority
problems
which
congress
sought
to
avoid.
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
submit
that
during
a
strike,
whatever
the
supervisor
is
called
upon
to
perform
his
part
of
his
normal
supervisory
or
management
functions,
because
during
a
strike,
the
supervisor
is
called
upon
to
help
out
in
any
way
that
the
--
that
is
necessary
to
keep
the
plant
going.
and
he
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
will
be
acting
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
true
but
he
is
caught
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea,
because
unlike
a
regular
employee
you
cannot
be
discharged
for
striking
a
supervisor,
he
is
a
management
representative
and
his
first
loyalty,
at
least
this
was
congress’s
intention
in
amending
the
act
in
47,
is
supposed
to
be
to
the
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
we
submit
that
that
upsets
the
balance
that
congress
drew
in
1947.
now
in
the
situation
where
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
yes
they
could;
yes
they
could.
but
i
think
that
the
unions
have
ordinarily
not
done
that.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that,
that’s
a
more
accurate
way
of
putting
it
mr.
justice
stewart.
is
the
seventh
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
wisconsin
electric
case,
which
is
pending
hereon
certiorari,
but
the
court
sustained
the
board
that
what
is
supervisory
duties
is
blurred
during
the
strike
situation,
because
what
a
supervisor’s
normal
duties
are
when
a
total
complement
that
employees
is
at
work,
is
totally
different
from
what
its
duties
maybe
during
the
strike,
when
there
are
few
or
no
employees
are
at
work,
and
it
is,
at
that
time,
whatever
he
is
doing
he
is
doing
as
part
of
management.
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
that
there
is
a
like
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
that
there
is
a
likely
to
be
a
lingering
effect
or
a
spill
over
effect.
at
least
the
employer
could
reasonably
so
fear
that
an
employee,
that
the
supervisor
having
been
subjected
to
this
discipline
for
doing
management’s
bidding
during
the
strike,
can
at
least
feel
under
a
sense
of
constraint
and
shade
things
in
the
union’s
way.
the
next
time
the
confrontation
arises
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
collective
bargaining
includes
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
that
occurs
in
the
grievance
adjustment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
the
adjustment
of
grievances
would
be
at
the
more
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
more
likely.
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
your
honor.
that
is
not
the
way
i
read
the
board’s
history.
the
board
--
to
my
--
the
best
of
my
research
was
not
presented
with
any
cases
involving
this
type
of
indirect
pressure
on
the
employer
that
flows
from
union
discipline
until
1968.
i
think
that
what
happened
is
that
after
this
court
decided
allis-chalmers
in
1967,
the
board
began
to
get
a
flurry
of
cases
involving
union
discipline
of
various
types
and
--
so
that
the
reason
that
this
doctrine
is
late
in
evolving,
is
not
for
the
reason
that
has
been
present
in
many
of
the
cases
that
i
have
recently
argued
before
this
court
that
the
board
has
changed
its
mind
three
or
four
times
over
the
course
of
history.
i
think
that
in
this
situation,
the
problem
just
did
not
arise.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
moot.
yes
your
honor,
it
is
moot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
they’re
in
the
disjunctive;
they
are
in
the
disjunctive.
now,
in
a
situation
where
the
employer
is
not
able
to
insist
that
he
is
--
successfully
that
he
has
employed
a
supervisor
leaving
the
union.
you
have
a
very
big
gap
in
effectuating
congress’s
objective
with
respect
to
supervisors,
unless
you
read
and
interpret
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
as
the
board
has
done.
now
to
be
sure,
the
legislative
history
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
contains
no
indication
that
the
provision
was
going
to
be
so
interpreted.
we
submit
that
this
is
because
congress
focused
on
the
most
obvious
forms
of
union
impairment
of
the
employer
selection
of
his
representative,
namely
the
direct
form
of
pressure.
and
in
these
circumstances,
we
have
the
familiar
problem
of
asking
which
choice
is
at
more
likely
that
congress
would
have
made.
had
it
been
presented
with
this
precise
problem,
and
we
submit
that
the
board
was
reasonable
in
view
of
congresses
clear-cut
intention
to
assure
employers
of
the
undivided
loyalty
of
its
supervisors,
it
would
have
sanctioned
the
interpretation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
that
the
board
has
employed
in
these
cases.
i’d
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
