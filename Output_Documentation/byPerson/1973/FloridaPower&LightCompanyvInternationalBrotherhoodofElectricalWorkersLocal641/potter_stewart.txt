mr.
come,
you
couldn’t
be
serious
in
response
to
my
brother
marshall’s
question
that
he
is
performing
supervisory
duties
during
the
strike.
he’s
not,
he’s
not
supervising
anybody.
he
is
performing
the
work
of
the
employees,
but
what
he
--
what
he
is
doing
is
performing
management
duties,
management
duties
because
by
definition,
the
employees
are
on
strike
and
no
ones
left
in
the
plant
are
management.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
into
the
interest
of
management
to
keep
the
business
going,
both
for
ordinary
business
reasons
and
also
for
strategic
and
tactical
reasons
in
the
strike.
justice
potter
stewart
he
cannot
supervise
it,
there
is
management
duty.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
puts
the
board
right
into
it,
because
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
creates
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
is
for
the
board
is
acceptable.
justice
potter
stewart
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
doesn’t
use
the
word
supervisors
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
representatives
in
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
in
the
strike
part
of
collective
bargaining?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
union
of
course,
explicitly
under
section
13
has
the
right
to
strike
but
surely
the
employer
has
the
right
to
use
self-help
and
to
do
whatever
he
can
to
keep
the
business
running
during
a
strike,
isn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
indeed
has
the
right
of
certain
circumstances
to
lock
up.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
seems
to
me
that
really
this
part
of
your
argument
is
almost
a
question
begging.
that’s
the
issue
here,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
this
case
is
about
is
what
can
the
union
do!
justice
potter
stewart
in
73-556,
73-795,
these
cases
are
both
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
united

court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.

during

of

we
granted
certiorari
because
this
is
a
novel
and
an
important
question
under
federal
labor
law.
for
the
reasons
set
out
at
some
length
in
the
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
agree
with
the
court
of

that
these

did
not
violate

provision
of
the

accordingly
the

before

are
affirmed.
