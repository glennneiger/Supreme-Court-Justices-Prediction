justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
argument
any
stronger,
mr.
nizer,
than
the
argument
that
the
producer
ought
not
to
be
compelled
to
tailor
his
product
to
the
perhaps
vagaries
of
50
different
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
having
rejected
the
national
standard,
how
much
force
is
there
in
the
argument
that
although
we
can
see
we
have
to
do
it
for
50
different
states,
we
shouldn’t
have
to
go
beyond
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
mean
not
constitutionally
obscene,
because
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
both
the
majority
and
the
same
appeal
spend
a
fair
amount
of
time
on
the
subject
whether
or
not
the
film
was
obscene
or
not,
didn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
look
at
justice
jordan’s
opinion
at
pages
53
and
54
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
says
that
trial
court
correctly
charged
this
definition
of
obscenity
of
the
guideline
for
the
jury
to
apply
in
this
particular
case
going
ahead
mentioned
the
roth
case,
memoirs
against
massachusetts,
our
decision
in
miller
against
california.
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
to
pass
on
that
and
view
it
or
whatever
the
bill
of
exceptions
before
them
was.
it
seems
to
me
that
they
did
say
that
it
was
constitutionally
permissible
to
find
this
film
obscene.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
our
rule
on
review
is
that,
even
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
might
not
have
had
to
deal
with
the
thing
under
its
procedure,
if
it
in
fact
dealt
with
it,
then
it’s
before
us
also,
at
least
that’s
my
understanding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
jenkins
against
georgia,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
upheld
the
conviction
of
billy
jenkins
for
showing
the
film
carnal
knowledge.
the
jury
in
georgia
found
he
was
guilty
of
a
statute
of
georgia
which
defines
obscenity
in
language
similar
to
that
used
in
our
opinion
in
memoirs
against
massachusetts.
we
agree
with
the
georgia
supreme
court’s
implicit
rule,
and
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
juries
in
state
obscenity
cases
to
be
instructed
to
apply
hypothetical
state
wide
standards
in
determining
obscenity.
but
we
cannot
accept
the
georgia
supreme
court’s
apparent
conclusion
that
the
jury's
verdict
against
appellant,
precluded
all
the
further
appellate
review
of
his
claim
that
his
exemption
of
the
film
was
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
it
would
be
a
serious
misreading
of
miller
to
conclude
that
juries
have
unbridled
discretions
in
determining
what
is
patently
offensive
under
the
miller
test.
our
own
view
of
the
film
impels
the
conclusion
that
there
is
nothing
in
carnal
knowledge
which
falls
within
the
two
examples
given
in
miller
of
what
may
be
found
patently
offensive.
nor
is
there
anything
sufficiently
similar
to
justify
similar
treatment.
while
there
are
scenes
in
which
sexual
conduct
including
ultimate
sexual
acts,
such
as
described
in
miller
are
to
understood
is
taking
place,
the
camera
does
not
focus
on
the
bodies
of
the
actors
at
such
times.
there
is
no
exhibition
whatever
of
the
actor’s
genitals
during
these
scenes.
there
are
occasional
scenes
of
nudity,
but
nudity
alone
is
not
enough
to
make
the
material
legally
obscene
under
miller.
we
conclude
this
as
simply
not
the
public
portrayal
of
hardcore
sexual
conduct
for
its
own
sake
and
for
ensuing
commercial
gain
which
was
said
to
be
punishable
in
miller.
since
carnal
knowledge
could
not
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
be
found
to
depict
sexual
conduct
in
a
patently
offensive
way
and
since
no
other
basis
appears
on
the
record
upon
which
appellant's
conviction
can
be
sustained,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
