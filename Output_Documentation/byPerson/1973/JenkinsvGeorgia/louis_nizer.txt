mr.
louis
nizer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
affirmed
a
criminal
conviction
for
the
exhibition
in
a
local
theater
in
albany,
georgia
of
a
motion
picture
entitled
“carnal
knowledge”.
the
defendant,
billy
jenkins
who
was
a
manager
of
the
theater
was
fined
$750
and
sentenced
to
one
year
probation.
the
fine
has
not
yet
been
paid
and
the
probation
has
been
stayed
pending
of
all
appeals.
there
is
no
question
that
only
persons
of
18
years
of
age
or
older
were
admitted
or
would
be
admitted
to
the
theater.
minors
or
juveniles
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
also,
this
case
does
not
involve
obtrusive
exhibition
to
unwilling
persons
nor
does
it
involve
pandering
despite
the
trial
judges’
instruction
to
the
jury
held
to
be
a
proper
judge
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
despite
the
undisputed
fact
that
there
isn’t
any
alter
of
evidence
in
the
record
of
pandering.
this
alone,
i
shall
later
allude
to
as
my
argument
on
due
process
as
sufficient
for
reversal.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
of
sanity.
“carnal
knowledge”
which
has
been
decided
obscene
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
been
proclaimed
by
discriminating
critics
throughout
our
country
as
a
serious,
artistic
work.
and
its
distinction
derives
from
the
combined
talents
of
many
of
america’s
leading
contemporary
artist
as
mike
nichols,
the
well-known
stage
and
motion
picture
director.
jules
feiffer,
a
satirist
and
playwright,
jack
nicholson,
candice
bergen
and
ann
margaret
who
incidentally
won
the
academy
award
nomination
for
her
performance
in
this
very
picture.
and
“carnal
knowledge”
has
played
to
17,500,000
people
in
some
5000
theaters
in
small
and
large
cities
including
the
state
of
georgia,
enjoying
popular
and
discriminating
acceptance
and
then
an
investigator
from
the
sheriff's
office
in
albany,
georgia
sees
the
film.
one
month
later,
jenkins
was
arrested
for
having
exhibited
this
film
and
the
sole
charge
was
public
indecency.
he
was
tried
by
a
jury
which
was
instructed
that
he
could
also
be
convicted
of
two
other
crimes
for
which
he
had
not
been
charged
namely
obscenity
and
pandering,
reversible
again.
the
jury
after
announcing
that
it
was
hopelessly
deadlocked,
it
would
stay
here
until
july
4,
finally
brought
in
a
general
verdict
of
guilty,
so
that
we
cannot
tell
on
what
of
these
three
counts,
two
of
them
illegally
judged,
improperly
judged,
he
was
convicted
of.
on
appeal
to
the
georgia’s
supreme
court
and
without
hearing
oral
argument,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
upheld
this
decision
by
four
to
three.
and
our
appeal
from
that
decision
presents
one
particular
constitutional
issue
which
is
of
profound
significance
to
cultural
freedom.
and
that
is,
will
the
sensitive
regard
for
first
amendment
rights
evidenced
by
the
clear
announcement
in
the
miller
decision
that
“hard
core”
pornography
and
only
“hard
core”
pornography
maybe
suppressed,
be
permitted
to
be
stretched
and
grievously
misinterpreted,
so
as
to
strike
down
a
work
of
serious
literary
and
artistic
achievement
such
as
“carnal
knowledge”.
the
dissenting
opinions
in
the
georgia
supreme
court
expressed
shock
that
exhibiting
so
meritorious
motion
picture
should
be
a
crime.
and
that
apprehension,
your
honors,
has
swept
through
all
the
creative
elements
of
our
nation
as
the
plethora
of
amicus
briefs
in
this
case
indicates.
from
producers
who
fear
to
risk
production,
to
theater
owners
who
fear
to
exhibit
on
pain
of
criminal
involvement,
to
book
publishers
who
fear
to
print
beyond
the
safe
norm,
to
authors
who
fear
to
be
innovative
and
most
important
of
all
to
the
public
which
maybe
deprived
of
access
to
aesthetic
diversity
which
flourishes
best
when
the
orders
does
not
reigned
in
and
when
we
must
not
conform
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
safe
presentation
and
the
damage
we
state
here
is
not
only
to
the
work
which
has
been
barred
but
the
less
visible
and
subtle
encroachment,
self-censorship
due
to
one’s
certainty.
in
short,
your
honors,
the
decision
appealed
from
though
have
a
chilling,
indeed
a
freezing
effect
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
of
expression.
unless,
--
unless,
the
threat
of
this
holding
of
obscenity
is
dealt
with
by
vigorous
renunciation
and
the
limitation
of
“hard
core”
pornography
is
declared
to
be
what
the
miller
decision
so
emphatically
stated
it
to
be,
the
soul
exception
to
the
protective
shield
of
the
first
amendment.
professor
bickel
had
written
in
1962,
that
the
radiating
consequences
of
decisions
impinging
on
the
first
amendment
would
encourage
constancian
tendencies.
and
recently,
he
stated
that
this
decision
on
“carnal
knowledge”
does
not
conform
to
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
in
miller.
indeed,
your
honors,
it
doesn’t.
it
is
unthinkable
that
this
picture
should
be
confused
with
“hard
core”
pornography.
the
film
depicts
two
college
students
over
a
span
of
about
30
years.
they
grow
older
but
they
don’t
grow
up.
they
are
preoccupied
with
sex
but
the
picture
is
not.
it
does
not
bombard
the
senses
with
erotica,
driving
out
all
other
ideas
which
is
a
typical
characteristic
of
“hard
core”
pornography.
on
the
contrary,
it
depicts
the
failure
of
the
boys’
lives
though
they
are
successful
in
their
professional
careers
because
they
cannot
establish
meaningful
relationships
and
they
are
ultimately
crushed
by
boredom,
loneliness
and
impotency.
the
picture
deals
with
the
human
predicament
resulting
from
the
enthronement
of
impersonal
detachment,
the
inability
to
love
and
the
sequelae
of
cruelty
and
psychic
illness.
and
this
artistic
treatment
of
this
problem
which
besets
this
decade
and
has
evoked
many
social
and
philosophical
studies
has
been
the
subject
that
plays
in
the
past
from
sternbergh
to
tennessee
williams
and
that
is
why
the
new
york
times
reviewer
called
it
“profound”,
the
saturday
review
“mature”,
the
atlanta
journal
“one
of
the
best
films
in
the
long
time”
and
the
catholic
film
newsletter
despite
some
reservations,
“a
perceptive
and
brilliant
put
down
of
a
certain
lifestyle.”
and
that
many
critics
throughout
the
country
who
have
heaped
similar
praise
upon
this
picture,
certainly
all
couldn’t
have
been
fantasizing.
the
language
in
this
picture,
your
honors,
is
blunt
although
not
within
dictionary
distance
of
the
erotic
poem
in
kois
against
wisconsin
which
this
court
understandably
held
was
not
obscene
because
it
bore
“some
ear
muffs”
of
an
attempt
at
serious
odd
even
though
the
authors
reach,
exceeded
his
grasp,
as
your
honor
said.
here,
it
can
be
claimed
credibly
that
a
literary
and
artistic
standard
was
achieved
and
it
was
not
beyond
the
grasp
of
the
multiple
talents
which
reach
for
it.
the
story
in
“carnal
knowledge”
predominates
over
any
visual
presentation.
the
greatest
care
was
lavished
on
sex,
lighting,
camera
effects,
musical
score,
brilliant
ensemble
acting,
all
under
the
direction
of
nichols,
a
claimed
among
the
most
gifted
of
cinematographic
artists
who
synthesized
the
ancient
arts
of
painting,
writing,
composing,
acting
in
a
new
universal
medium.
and
the
resulting
dominant
effect
of
the
picture
as
a
whole
is
a
sincere
and
earnest
effort
to
create
a
literary
and
artistic
work
and
to
confuse
that
result
with
pornographic
imbecility
is
cultural
illiteracy.
the
decision
below
ignores
inexcusably
the
miller
distinction
between
commerce
and
ideas
and
the
commercial
exploitation
of
sex
for
its
own
sake.
and
it
does
make
the
distribution
of
films
and
book
a
more
hazardous
enterprise.
now,
this
court
has
reserved
the
right
of
independent
review
of
a
constitutional
fact
of
obscenity.
and
we
submit
respectfully
that
the
answer
is
clear
that
“carnal
knowledge”
is
not
obscene.
now,
another
reversible
error
which
we
urge
was
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
its
opinion
maybe
interpreted
to
have
applied
the
community
standard
to
determine
whether
the
work
had
value.
it
is
somewhat
ambiguous
but
that
ambiguity
is
cleared
up,
your
honor
because
in
the
subsequent
decision
by
the
same
court,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
slaton
against
paris
adult
theater,
it
was
clear
that
it
expressly
applied
community
standards
to
all
parts
of
the
obscenity
test.
now,
of
course
this
is
fatal
error.
even
if
a
majority
of
the
people
in
the
community
thought
otherwise,
chaucer
and
boccaccio,
and
ravalet
and
fielding
would
still
have
literary
value.
the
test
is
quality
not
popularity.
and
that
is
based
on
the
inherent
evaluation
of
the
whole
work
not
by
poll
taking.
a
work
which
has
literary
value
has
therefore
the
impregnable
shelter
of
the
first
amendment.
it
cannot
be
subjected
to
the
other
two
tests
of
obscenity,
default
that
it’s
immunity.
so,
we
need
go
no
further.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
remaining
two
tests
of
obscenity
are
also
not
met
in
this
case.
“carnal
knowledge”
does
not
appeal
to
prurient
interest
nor
is
it
patently
offensive
nor
does
it
depict
“hard
core”
sexual
conduct.
the
work
belies
any
purpose
to
titillate
or
to
exploit
sex
commercially
for
its
own
sake.
the
camera
is
almost
always
on
the
faces
of
the
characters
not
below.
the
camera
angles
are
deliberately
discreet
picturing
the
least
not
the
most.
and
when
the
point
is
made
it
terminates
the
scene
not
extending
it
with
explicitness
and
sex
is
treated
in
this
film
as
a
sometimes
battling
and
exasperating
part
of
life
but
without
lewdness
or
(inaudible)
and
briefly
stated
that
your
honors,
material
cannot
be
obscene
unless
it
meets
all
three
tests
of
miller.
“carnal
knowledge”
is
a
film
which
meets
none
of
these
tests.
how
large
should
or
must
the
community
be
which
determines
the
applicable
standard
for
pruriency
and
offensiveness.
the
state
decisions
your
honor
have
varied
and
conflicted
with
each
other.
some
apply
in
state
like
new
york
and
washington.
some
apply
in
the
local
like
florida
and
alabama
and
one
state
both,
texas.
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
a
local
standard
was
permissible
but
gave
no
clue
as
to
whether
that
local
meant
county,
city,
neighborhood,
block
or
whatever.
and
that
local
standard
is
therefore
void
for
vagueness.
moreover,
even
if
the
local
area
were
specified
or
defined
precisely,
we
believe,
it
would
create
constitutionally
intolerable
consequences.
let
me
cite
a
few
facts
in
support
of
that
contention
because
we
urge
that
the
state
geographical
limit
is
to
be
the
minimum
requirement.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
would
end
the
case
there
quite
right,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
is
right.
and
it
would
not
direct
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
mr.
louis
nizer
right.
and
not
only
would
that
that.
in
support
to
that
view,
it
seems
to
us,
we
are
dealing
the
literary
and
artistic
value,
community
standard
is
irrelevant.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
and
the
only
reason
i
addressed
myself
to
it
is
that
this
case
raises
several
issues
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
the
interest
of
what
justice
brennan
has
referred
to
as
the
institutional
burden
on
the
court
to
stop
perhaps
hundreds,
maybe
thousands
of
applications
as
to
what
is
the
area,
the
geographical
area
for
community
standard,
that
it
might
be
worthwhile
for
this
court
to
examine
this
matter
and
i
address
myself
to
it
even
though
case
would
be
over
if
this
case
isn’t
--
if
the
picture
isn’t
obscene
at
the
end
of
it,
reversal
would
be
required.
indeed,
it
would
be
required
on
due
process
entirely
apart
even
of
obscenity.
so,
i
wish
to
--
if
this
court
should
wish
to
further
examine
this
matter
because
as
we
read
the
miller
decision,
it
didn’t
specify
what
the
geographical
area
must
be.
it
merely
was
permissible
with
respect
to
local
or
state.
in
their
indications,
it
meant
state
to
us.
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
even
if
the
local
area
were
precisely
defined,
we
think
that
it
would
still
create
an
intolerable
burden
on
the
first
amendment
for
these
reasons.
there
are
more
that
78,200
separate
political
subdivisions
in
the
50
states.
there
are
approximately
14,800
motion
picture
theaters
in
the
united
states
and
in
many
states,
these
subdivisions
overlap.
thus,
a
single
theater
or
a
bookstore
could
be
located
within
a
number
of
different
subdivisions.
this
creates
a
sort
of
a
crazy
quilt
of
conflicting
standards
and
all
of
this
would
cast
intolerable
burdens
on
the
distribution
and
dissemination
of
communications.
now,
your
honors,
i’m
sure
recognized
that
isn’t
feasible
to
prepare
different
versions
of
books
and
films
for
distribution
in
different
parts
of
each
state.
these
practical
considerations
invade
the
constitutional
realm
but
they
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
expression
of
thought
and
that
they
compel
the
author,
the
producer
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of
uncertain
determinations
on
pain
of
criminal
punishment?
mr.
louis
nizer
if
this
court
would
recognize
a
review
of
its
consideration
as
to
a
national
standard
which
is
what
your
question,
justice
rehnquist
implies
to
me,
we
would
not
be
unhappy.
but
we
think
--
mr.
louis
nizer
great
force
in
that
the
vulcanization
of
this
issue
of
submissions
to
78,000
potential
divisions
as
against
50
states
seems
to
me
to
be
great
in
difference
in
degree.
and
what
we’re
dealing
here
with
is
the
rule
of
reason
as
this
court
had
said,
no
provision
will
be
perfect
and
furthermore
there
is
a
natural
division
for
state
rights,
since
the
statute
is
state
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
rather
natural
to
follow
that
sovereignty
of
that
geographical
area
rather
than
omit
its
fragmentation
to
dozens
of
thousands
of
local
communities
each
of
which
require
definition.
so,
i
think
it
would
at
least
diminish
the
chilling
effect
of
these
limitations.
at
least,
i
respectfully
submit
that’s
a
great
possibility.
now,
another
form
of
constitutional
inhibition
caused
by
local
standards
is
that
an
affirmance
by
the
highest
court
of
that
state
of
a
purely
local
finding
of
obscenity,
in
effect,
forecloses
other
local
areas
within
the
state
from
their
right
to
make
their
own
test,
not
legally
but
psychologically
and
as
justice
holmes
wrote
in
a
dissenting
opinion
below.
local
standards,
he
said,
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
few,
the
taste
of
cultural
advancement
of
the
many
who
are
members
of
the
greater
state
community.
so,
where
this
is
a
state
statute,
it
is
more
reasonable
to
insist
upon
a
state
standard
thus
also
limiting
the
number
of
confusions
and
the
hodgepodge
of
local
areas
overlapping
with
each
other
and
coming
to
this
court
to
ask
whether
they
are
constitutionally
viable
standard.
i
now
proceed
to
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
city
ordinance
defines
by
its
own
arrangement,
the
specific
area,
but
where
we
are
dealing
with
a
constitutional
question,
and
after
all
the
constitution
is
national,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
tend
towards
this
theory
which
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
as
you
widen
the
circumference
of
the
geographical
area,
you
decrease
the
possible
inhibition
of
the
first
amendment.
the
little
town
of
a
block
or
the
neighborhood,
more
probability
of
inhibitions
upon
first
amendments
state
less
and
even
national
still
less,
therefore
i
think
the
tendency
ought
to
be
to
make
the
geographical
area
larger
and
by
natural
boundaries
at
least
the
minimum
requirement
ought
to
be
the
state
which
i
read
the
miller
decision
to
tend
to,
although
i’m
not
certain.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
but
--
mr.
louis
nizer
it’s
certainly
is
arguable,
but
i
think
it
would
be
most
unfortunate
if
we
didn’t
make
a
standard,
community
standard,
the
minimum
requirement
for
constitutional
reasons,
do
delimit
the
impact
upon
the
right
of
expression.
it
is
difficult
enough
as
it
is,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
indicated
by
his
question
really,
it
creates
the
practical
problem,
but
it
invades
the
constitutional
realm.
how
are
we
going
to
make
a
book
into
so
many
sections
that
we
can
give
it
to
each
local
area
--
at
least
if
you
have
50
states,
that’s
bad
enough,
but
it’s
a
little
easier
and
that’s
true
of
motion
pictures.
mr.
louis
nizer
i’m
not
sure,
i
understand
the
question.
i
would
have
each
state
area
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
mr.
louis
nizer
the
state
statute
ought
to
be
interpreted
as
a
minimum
requirement,
the
community
standard
must
be
gaged
by
that
state
in
which
the
statute
exists.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
is
right,
sir.
that’s
the
way
i
would
interpret
it.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
they
do,
your
honor
and
i
suppose
that
we
will
never
have
anything,
but
an
approximation
of
a
practical
solution
where
you’re
dealing
with
the
constitutional
prerogatives
into
divisions
into
states
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
applying
them.
mr.
louis
nizer
i
believe
very
strongly
in
the
jury
system
that
when
they
decide
facts,
when
they
decide
constitutional
facts,
and
i
think
as
this
court
properly
said,
you
reserve
to
yourselves
the
independent
review
because
of
the
overall
umbrella
of
constitutional
requirement.
and
i
would
distinguish
jury
inviolability
between
ordinary
facts
in
which
i
trust
their
commonsense.
they
have
seven
senses,
not
five.
they
add
some
comment
and
i
believe
in
them,
but
when
it
comes
to
a
constitutional
fact
as
professor
bickel
said,
if
a
jury
decided
that
a
woman’s
leg
was
up
seen,
this
court
would
be
urged
from
or
if
it
was
decided
that
the
statue
of
david
must
have
fig
leaf
on
it,
this
court
would
be
heard
from
and
we
wouldn’t
accept
the
jury’s
decision
even
though
i
trust
their
wisdom
generally.
and
it
is
because
of
this
question
being
instinct
with
constitutional
problems
that
we
urge
that
special
consideration.
i
may
say
in
all
candor,
since
the
question
of
national
standard
has
come
up,
understanding
your
honors’
ruling
and
accepting
it
respectfully
that
there
is
too
much
diversity
in
a
large
country
such
as
ours
to
have
a
national
standard.
but
if
this
court
were
to
give
further
consideration
to
that
matter,
i
would
like
to
submit
diffidently
three
reflections.
first,
there
is
what
i
would
like
to
call
a
technological
equalizer
in
the
nation.
the
media
today,
the
same
columnist
in
different
newspapers,
news
week,
time
magazine
all
over
the
nation,
ease
of
travel
etcetera
have
reduced
the
diversity
in
the
nation.
not
entirely,
but
have
reduced
it.
secondly,
i
think
there
is
diversity
within
the
state
and
within
the
locality.
upstate
is
different
from
downstate
in
many
areas
and
indeed
in
the
locality,
the
urban
and
the
other
city
certified
aspect
that
even
of
a
small
town
is
quite
different.
finally,
in
the
federal
obscenity
act,
your
honor
and
in
other
such
areas
as
mail
and
transportation,
international
transportation,
we
take
a
national
standard
and
i
would
think
that
we
would
not
be
unhappy
if
your
honors
decided
because
of
these
considerations
to
perhaps
set
a
national
standard
on
the
matter
of
this
importance.
but
we
urge
only
that
the
minimum
standard
ought
to
be
the
state
or
there
would
be
hopeless
confusion
and
more
impact
upon
the
first
amendment
right.
time
does
not
support
me
and
i
would
like
to
lean
on
our
brief
with
respect
to
due
process,
but
i
would
like
to
just
point
a
finger
at
two
propositions.
first,
jenkins
was
charged
with
section
26
2105
which
is
public
indecency
and
was
the
only
charge
in
the
accusation.
then
the
court
below
and
that
charge
was
approved
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
or
else
i
wouldn’t
raise
it
here.
the
court
below
charged
the
jury
that
it
could
also
find
him
guilty
of
obscenity
which
is
another
section
and
another
crime,
2601,
not
2605,
and
they
could
also
charge
him
with
pandering
which
is
quite
preposterous.
there’s
not
even
a
word
of
evidence
about
that
and
this
case
doesn’t
fit
pandering
anyhow.
this
isn’t
a
close
case
such
as
ginsberg
where
that
became
an
issue.
and
therefore
when
the
jury
brought
in
a
general
verdict,
no
one
can
tell
what
they
found.
in
addition
to
that,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
construed
2105
which
is
public
indecency
together
with
2101
which
is
obscenity,
construed
them
together.
they
have
different
penalty
provisions.
they
were
passed
at
different
times
by
the
legislature.
one
of
them
even
submits
a
tax
for
distributing
obscene
material.
no
one
knows
which
penalty
would
apply.
and
as
construed
together,
2101
becomes
unconstitutional
because
it
doesn’t
meet
the
standards
of
this
court
and
2105
is
unconstitutional
because
that
only
applies
to
conduct
and
shouldn’t
have
even
been
submitted
with
respect
to
dissemination
of
material.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
nizer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
affirmed
a
criminal
conviction
for
the
exhibition
in
a
local
theater
in
albany,
georgia
of
a
motion
picture
entitled
“carnal
knowledge”.
the
defendant,
billy
jenkins
who
was
a
manager
of
the
theater
was
fined
$750
and
sentenced
to
one
year
probation.
the
fine
has
not
yet
been
paid
and
the
probation
has
been
stayed
pending
of
all
appeals.
there
is
no
question
that
only
persons
of
18
years
of
age
or
older
were
admitted
or
would
be
admitted
to
the
theater.
minors
or
juveniles
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
also,
this
case
does
not
involve
obtrusive
exhibition
to
unwilling
persons
nor
does
it
involve
pandering
despite
the
trial
judges’
instruction
to
the
jury
held
to
be
a
proper
judge
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
despite
the
undisputed
fact
that
there
isn’t
any
alter
of
evidence
in
the
record
of
pandering.
this
alone,
i
shall
later
allude
to
as
my
argument
on
due
process
as
sufficient
for
reversal.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
of
sanity.
“carnal
knowledge”
which
has
been
decided
obscene
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
been
proclaimed
by
discriminating
critics
throughout
our
country
as
a
serious,
artistic
work.
and
its
distinction
derives
from
the
combined
talents
of
many
of
america’s
leading
contemporary
artist
as
mike
nichols,
the
well-known
stage
and
motion
picture
director.
jules
feiffer,
a
satirist
and
playwright,
jack
nicholson,
candice
bergen
and
ann
margaret
who
incidentally
won
the
academy
award
nomination
for
her
performance
in
this
very
picture.
and
“carnal
knowledge”
has
played
to
17,500,000
people
in
some
5000
theaters
in
small
and
large
cities
including
the
state
of
georgia,
enjoying
popular
and
discriminating
acceptance
and
then
an
investigator
from
the
sheriff's
office
in
albany,
georgia
sees
the
film.
one
month
later,
jenkins
was
arrested
for
having
exhibited
this
film
and
the
sole
charge
was
public
indecency.
he
was
tried
by
a
jury
which
was
instructed
that
he
could
also
be
convicted
of
two
other
crimes
for
which
he
had
not
been
charged
namely
obscenity
and
pandering,
reversible
again.
the
jury
after
announcing
that
it
was
hopelessly
deadlocked,
it
would
stay
here
until
july
4,
finally
brought
in
a
general
verdict
of
guilty,
so
that
we
cannot
tell
on
what
of
these
three
counts,
two
of
them
illegally
judged,
improperly
judged,
he
was
convicted
of.
on
appeal
to
the
georgia’s
supreme
court
and
without
hearing
oral
argument,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
upheld
this
decision
by
four
to
three.
and
our
appeal
from
that
decision
presents
one
particular
constitutional
issue
which
is
of
profound
significance
to
cultural
freedom.
and
that
is,
will
the
sensitive
regard
for
first
amendment
rights
evidenced
by
the
clear
announcement
in
the
miller
decision
that
“hard
core”
pornography
and
only
“hard
core”
pornography
maybe
suppressed,
be
permitted
to
be
stretched
and
grievously
misinterpreted,
so
as
to
strike
down
a
work
of
serious
literary
and
artistic
achievement
such
as
“carnal
knowledge”.
the
dissenting
opinions
in
the
georgia
supreme
court
expressed
shock
that
exhibiting
so
meritorious
motion
picture
should
be
a
crime.
and
that
apprehension,
your
honors,
has
swept
through
all
the
creative
elements
of
our
nation
as
the
plethora
of
amicus
briefs
in
this
case
indicates.
from
producers
who
fear
to
risk
production,
to
theater
owners
who
fear
to
exhibit
on
pain
of
criminal
involvement,
to
book
publishers
who
fear
to
print
beyond
the
safe
norm,
to
authors
who
fear
to
be
innovative
and
most
important
of
all
to
the
public
which
maybe
deprived
of
access
to
aesthetic
diversity
which
flourishes
best
when
the
orders
does
not
reigned
in
and
when
we
must
not
conform
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
safe
presentation
and
the
damage
we
state
here
is
not
only
to
the
work
which
has
been
barred
but
the
less
visible
and
subtle
encroachment,
self-censorship
due
to
one’s
certainty.
in
short,
your
honors,
the
decision
appealed
from
though
have
a
chilling,
indeed
a
freezing
effect
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
of
expression.
unless,
--
unless,
the
threat
of
this
holding
of
obscenity
is
dealt
with
by
vigorous
renunciation
and
the
limitation
of
“hard
core”
pornography
is
declared
to
be
what
the
miller
decision
so
emphatically
stated
it
to
be,
the
soul
exception
to
the
protective
shield
of
the
first
amendment.
professor
bickel
had
written
in
1962,
that
the
radiating
consequences
of
decisions
impinging
on
the
first
amendment
would
encourage
constancian
tendencies.
and
recently,
he
stated
that
this
decision
on
“carnal
knowledge”
does
not
conform
to
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
in
miller.
indeed,
your
honors,
it
doesn’t.
it
is
unthinkable
that
this
picture
should
be
confused
with
“hard
core”
pornography.
the
film
depicts
two
college
students
over
a
span
of
about
30
years.
they
grow
older
but
they
don’t
grow
up.
they
are
preoccupied
with
sex
but
the
picture
is
not.
it
does
not
bombard
the
senses
with
erotica,
driving
out
all
other
ideas
which
is
a
typical
characteristic
of
“hard
core”
pornography.
on
the
contrary,
it
depicts
the
failure
of
the
boys’
lives
though
they
are
successful
in
their
professional
careers
because
they
cannot
establish
meaningful
relationships
and
they
are
ultimately
crushed
by
boredom,
loneliness
and
impotency.
the
picture
deals
with
the
human
predicament
resulting
from
the
enthronement
of
impersonal
detachment,
the
inability
to
love
and
the
sequelae
of
cruelty
and
psychic
illness.
and
this
artistic
treatment
of
this
problem
which
besets
this
decade
and
has
evoked
many
social
and
philosophical
studies
has
been
the
subject
that
plays
in
the
past
from
sternbergh
to
tennessee
williams
and
that
is
why
the
new
york
times
reviewer
called
it
“profound”,
the
saturday
review
“mature”,
the
atlanta
journal
“one
of
the
best
films
in
the
long
time”
and
the
catholic
film
newsletter
despite
some
reservations,
“a
perceptive
and
brilliant
put
down
of
a
certain
lifestyle.”
and
that
many
critics
throughout
the
country
who
have
heaped
similar
praise
upon
this
picture,
certainly
all
couldn’t
have
been
fantasizing.
the
language
in
this
picture,
your
honors,
is
blunt
although
not
within
dictionary
distance
of
the
erotic
poem
in
kois
against
wisconsin
which
this
court
understandably
held
was
not
obscene
because
it
bore
“some
ear
muffs”
of
an
attempt
at
serious
odd
even
though
the
authors
reach,
exceeded
his
grasp,
as
your
honor
said.
here,
it
can
be
claimed
credibly
that
a
literary
and
artistic
standard
was
achieved
and
it
was
not
beyond
the
grasp
of
the
multiple
talents
which
reach
for
it.
the
story
in
“carnal
knowledge”
predominates
over
any
visual
presentation.
the
greatest
care
was
lavished
on
sex,
lighting,
camera
effects,
musical
score,
brilliant
ensemble
acting,
all
under
the
direction
of
nichols,
a
claimed
among
the
most
gifted
of
cinematographic
artists
who
synthesized
the
ancient
arts
of
painting,
writing,
composing,
acting
in
a
new
universal
medium.
and
the
resulting
dominant
effect
of
the
picture
as
a
whole
is
a
sincere
and
earnest
effort
to
create
a
literary
and
artistic
work
and
to
confuse
that
result
with
pornographic
imbecility
is
cultural
illiteracy.
the
decision
below
ignores
inexcusably
the
miller
distinction
between
commerce
and
ideas
and
the
commercial
exploitation
of
sex
for
its
own
sake.
and
it
does
make
the
distribution
of
films
and
book
a
more
hazardous
enterprise.
now,
this
court
has
reserved
the
right
of
independent
review
of
a
constitutional
fact
of
obscenity.
and
we
submit
respectfully
that
the
answer
is
clear
that
“carnal
knowledge”
is
not
obscene.
now,
another
reversible
error
which
we
urge
was
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
its
opinion
maybe
interpreted
to
have
applied
the
community
standard
to
determine
whether
the
work
had
value.
it
is
somewhat
ambiguous
but
that
ambiguity
is
cleared
up,
your
honor
because
in
the
subsequent
decision
by
the
same
court,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
slaton
against
paris
adult
theater,
it
was
clear
that
it
expressly
applied
community
standards
to
all
parts
of
the
obscenity
test.
now,
of
course
this
is
fatal
error.
even
if
a
majority
of
the
people
in
the
community
thought
otherwise,
chaucer
and
boccaccio,
and
ravalet
and
fielding
would
still
have
literary
value.
the
test
is
quality
not
popularity.
and
that
is
based
on
the
inherent
evaluation
of
the
whole
work
not
by
poll
taking.
a
work
which
has
literary
value
has
therefore
the
impregnable
shelter
of
the
first
amendment.
it
cannot
be
subjected
to
the
other
two
tests
of
obscenity,
default
that
it’s
immunity.
so,
we
need
go
no
further.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
remaining
two
tests
of
obscenity
are
also
not
met
in
this
case.
“carnal
knowledge”
does
not
appeal
to
prurient
interest
nor
is
it
patently
offensive
nor
does
it
depict
“hard
core”
sexual
conduct.
the
work
belies
any
purpose
to
titillate
or
to
exploit
sex
commercially
for
its
own
sake.
the
camera
is
almost
always
on
the
faces
of
the
characters
not
below.
the
camera
angles
are
deliberately
discreet
picturing
the
least
not
the
most.
and
when
the
point
is
made
it
terminates
the
scene
not
extending
it
with
explicitness
and
sex
is
treated
in
this
film
as
a
sometimes
battling
and
exasperating
part
of
life
but
without
lewdness
or
(inaudible)
and
briefly
stated
that
your
honors,
material
cannot
be
obscene
unless
it
meets
all
three
tests
of
miller.
“carnal
knowledge”
is
a
film
which
meets
none
of
these
tests.
how
large
should
or
must
the
community
be
which
determines
the
applicable
standard
for
pruriency
and
offensiveness.
the
state
decisions
your
honor
have
varied
and
conflicted
with
each
other.
some
apply
in
state
like
new
york
and
washington.
some
apply
in
the
local
like
florida
and
alabama
and
one
state
both,
texas.
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
that
a
local
standard
was
permissible
but
gave
no
clue
as
to
whether
that
local
meant
county,
city,
neighborhood,
block
or
whatever.
and
that
local
standard
is
therefore
void
for
vagueness.
moreover,
even
if
the
local
area
were
specified
or
defined
precisely,
we
believe,
it
would
create
constitutionally
intolerable
consequences.
let
me
cite
a
few
facts
in
support
of
that
contention
because
we
urge
that
the
state
geographical
limit
is
to
be
the
minimum
requirement.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
would
end
the
case
there
quite
right,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
is
right.
and
it
would
not
direct
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
mr.
louis
nizer
right.
and
not
only
would
that
that.
in
support
to
that
view,
it
seems
to
us,
we
are
dealing
the
literary
and
artistic
value,
community
standard
is
irrelevant.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
and
the
only
reason
i
addressed
myself
to
it
is
that
this
case
raises
several
issues
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
the
interest
of
what
justice
brennan
has
referred
to
as
the
institutional
burden
on
the
court
to
stop
perhaps
hundreds,
maybe
thousands
of
applications
as
to
what
is
the
area,
the
geographical
area
for
community
standard,
that
it
might
be
worthwhile
for
this
court
to
examine
this
matter
and
i
address
myself
to
it
even
though
case
would
be
over
if
this
case
isn’t
--
if
the
picture
isn’t
obscene
at
the
end
of
it,
reversal
would
be
required.
indeed,
it
would
be
required
on
due
process
entirely
apart
even
of
obscenity.
so,
i
wish
to
--
if
this
court
should
wish
to
further
examine
this
matter
because
as
we
read
the
miller
decision,
it
didn’t
specify
what
the
geographical
area
must
be.
it
merely
was
permissible
with
respect
to
local
or
state.
in
their
indications,
it
meant
state
to
us.
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
even
if
the
local
area
were
precisely
defined,
we
think
that
it
would
still
create
an
intolerable
burden
on
the
first
amendment
for
these
reasons.
there
are
more
that
78,200
separate
political
subdivisions
in
the
50
states.
there
are
approximately
14,800
motion
picture
theaters
in
the
united
states
and
in
many
states,
these
subdivisions
overlap.
thus,
a
single
theater
or
a
bookstore
could
be
located
within
a
number
of
different
subdivisions.
this
creates
a
sort
of
a
crazy
quilt
of
conflicting
standards
and
all
of
this
would
cast
intolerable
burdens
on
the
distribution
and
dissemination
of
communications.
now,
your
honors,
i’m
sure
recognized
that
isn’t
feasible
to
prepare
different
versions
of
books
and
films
for
distribution
in
different
parts
of
each
state.
these
practical
considerations
invade
the
constitutional
realm
but
they
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
expression
of
thought
and
that
they
compel
the
author,
the
producer
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of
uncertain
determinations
on
pain
of
criminal
punishment?
mr.
louis
nizer
if
this
court
would
recognize
a
review
of
its
consideration
as
to
a
national
standard
which
is
what
your
question,
justice
rehnquist
implies
to
me,
we
would
not
be
unhappy.
but
we
think
--
mr.
louis
nizer
great
force
in
that
the
vulcanization
of
this
issue
of
submissions
to
78,000
potential
divisions
as
against
50
states
seems
to
me
to
be
great
in
difference
in
degree.
and
what
we’re
dealing
here
with
is
the
rule
of
reason
as
this
court
had
said,
no
provision
will
be
perfect
and
furthermore
there
is
a
natural
division
for
state
rights,
since
the
statute
is
state
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
rather
natural
to
follow
that
sovereignty
of
that
geographical
area
rather
than
omit
its
fragmentation
to
dozens
of
thousands
of
local
communities
each
of
which
require
definition.
so,
i
think
it
would
at
least
diminish
the
chilling
effect
of
these
limitations.
at
least,
i
respectfully
submit
that’s
a
great
possibility.
now,
another
form
of
constitutional
inhibition
caused
by
local
standards
is
that
an
affirmance
by
the
highest
court
of
that
state
of
a
purely
local
finding
of
obscenity,
in
effect,
forecloses
other
local
areas
within
the
state
from
their
right
to
make
their
own
test,
not
legally
but
psychologically
and
as
justice
holmes
wrote
in
a
dissenting
opinion
below.
local
standards,
he
said,
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
few,
the
taste
of
cultural
advancement
of
the
many
who
are
members
of
the
greater
state
community.
so,
where
this
is
a
state
statute,
it
is
more
reasonable
to
insist
upon
a
state
standard
thus
also
limiting
the
number
of
confusions
and
the
hodgepodge
of
local
areas
overlapping
with
each
other
and
coming
to
this
court
to
ask
whether
they
are
constitutionally
viable
standard.
i
now
proceed
to
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
city
ordinance
defines
by
its
own
arrangement,
the
specific
area,
but
where
we
are
dealing
with
a
constitutional
question,
and
after
all
the
constitution
is
national,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
tend
towards
this
theory
which
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
as
you
widen
the
circumference
of
the
geographical
area,
you
decrease
the
possible
inhibition
of
the
first
amendment.
the
little
town
of
a
block
or
the
neighborhood,
more
probability
of
inhibitions
upon
first
amendments
state
less
and
even
national
still
less,
therefore
i
think
the
tendency
ought
to
be
to
make
the
geographical
area
larger
and
by
natural
boundaries
at
least
the
minimum
requirement
ought
to
be
the
state
which
i
read
the
miller
decision
to
tend
to,
although
i’m
not
certain.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
but
--
mr.
louis
nizer
it’s
certainly
is
arguable,
but
i
think
it
would
be
most
unfortunate
if
we
didn’t
make
a
standard,
community
standard,
the
minimum
requirement
for
constitutional
reasons,
do
delimit
the
impact
upon
the
right
of
expression.
it
is
difficult
enough
as
it
is,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
indicated
by
his
question
really,
it
creates
the
practical
problem,
but
it
invades
the
constitutional
realm.
how
are
we
going
to
make
a
book
into
so
many
sections
that
we
can
give
it
to
each
local
area
--
at
least
if
you
have
50
states,
that’s
bad
enough,
but
it’s
a
little
easier
and
that’s
true
of
motion
pictures.
mr.
louis
nizer
i’m
not
sure,
i
understand
the
question.
i
would
have
each
state
area
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
mr.
louis
nizer
the
state
statute
ought
to
be
interpreted
as
a
minimum
requirement,
the
community
standard
must
be
gaged
by
that
state
in
which
the
statute
exists.
mr.
louis
nizer
that
is
right,
sir.
that’s
the
way
i
would
interpret
it.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
they
do,
your
honor
and
i
suppose
that
we
will
never
have
anything,
but
an
approximation
of
a
practical
solution
where
you’re
dealing
with
the
constitutional
prerogatives
into
divisions
into
states
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
applying
them.
mr.
louis
nizer
i
believe
very
strongly
in
the
jury
system
that
when
they
decide
facts,
when
they
decide
constitutional
facts,
and
i
think
as
this
court
properly
said,
you
reserve
to
yourselves
the
independent
review
because
of
the
overall
umbrella
of
constitutional
requirement.
and
i
would
distinguish
jury
inviolability
between
ordinary
facts
in
which
i
trust
their
commonsense.
they
have
seven
senses,
not
five.
they
add
some
comment
and
i
believe
in
them,
but
when
it
comes
to
a
constitutional
fact
as
professor
bickel
said,
if
a
jury
decided
that
a
woman’s
leg
was
up
seen,
this
court
would
be
urged
from
or
if
it
was
decided
that
the
statue
of
david
must
have
fig
leaf
on
it,
this
court
would
be
heard
from
and
we
wouldn’t
accept
the
jury’s
decision
even
though
i
trust
their
wisdom
generally.
and
it
is
because
of
this
question
being
instinct
with
constitutional
problems
that
we
urge
that
special
consideration.
i
may
say
in
all
candor,
since
the
question
of
national
standard
has
come
up,
understanding
your
honors’
ruling
and
accepting
it
respectfully
that
there
is
too
much
diversity
in
a
large
country
such
as
ours
to
have
a
national
standard.
but
if
this
court
were
to
give
further
consideration
to
that
matter,
i
would
like
to
submit
diffidently
three
reflections.
first,
there
is
what
i
would
like
to
call
a
technological
equalizer
in
the
nation.
the
media
today,
the
same
columnist
in
different
newspapers,
news
week,
time
magazine
all
over
the
nation,
ease
of
travel
etcetera
have
reduced
the
diversity
in
the
nation.
not
entirely,
but
have
reduced
it.
secondly,
i
think
there
is
diversity
within
the
state
and
within
the
locality.
upstate
is
different
from
downstate
in
many
areas
and
indeed
in
the
locality,
the
urban
and
the
other
city
certified
aspect
that
even
of
a
small
town
is
quite
different.
finally,
in
the
federal
obscenity
act,
your
honor
and
in
other
such
areas
as
mail
and
transportation,
international
transportation,
we
take
a
national
standard
and
i
would
think
that
we
would
not
be
unhappy
if
your
honors
decided
because
of
these
considerations
to
perhaps
set
a
national
standard
on
the
matter
of
this
importance.
but
we
urge
only
that
the
minimum
standard
ought
to
be
the
state
or
there
would
be
hopeless
confusion
and
more
impact
upon
the
first
amendment
right.
time
does
not
support
me
and
i
would
like
to
lean
on
our
brief
with
respect
to
due
process,
but
i
would
like
to
just
point
a
finger
at
two
propositions.
first,
jenkins
was
charged
with
section
26
2105
which
is
public
indecency
and
was
the
only
charge
in
the
accusation.
then
the
court
below
and
that
charge
was
approved
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
or
else
i
wouldn’t
raise
it
here.
the
court
below
charged
the
jury
that
it
could
also
find
him
guilty
of
obscenity
which
is
another
section
and
another
crime,
2601,
not
2605,
and
they
could
also
charge
him
with
pandering
which
is
quite
preposterous.
there’s
not
even
a
word
of
evidence
about
that
and
this
case
doesn’t
fit
pandering
anyhow.
this
isn’t
a
close
case
such
as
ginsberg
where
that
became
an
issue.
and
therefore
when
the
jury
brought
in
a
general
verdict,
no
one
can
tell
what
they
found.
in
addition
to
that,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
construed
2105
which
is
public
indecency
together
with
2101
which
is
obscenity,
construed
them
together.
they
have
different
penalty
provisions.
they
were
passed
at
different
times
by
the
legislature.
one
of
them
even
submits
a
tax
for
distributing
obscene
material.
no
one
knows
which
penalty
would
apply.
and
as
construed
together,
2101
becomes
unconstitutional
because
it
doesn’t
meet
the
standards
of
this
court
and
2105
is
unconstitutional
because
that
only
applies
to
conduct
and
shouldn’t
have
even
been
submitted
with
respect
to
dissemination
of
material.
thank
you.
