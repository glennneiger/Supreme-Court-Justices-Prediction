mr.
tony
h.
hight
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
like
to,
if
i
may,
go
back
a
little
further
in
the
chronology
of
the
case
to
point
out
that
sometime
prior
to
the
instant
case
in
a
case
involving
martin
theaters
which
you
will
find
on
page
66
of
the
record
below,
some
remark
brought
to
at
the
same
film
“carnal
knowledge”
was
involved
in
city
of
albany,
georgia
which
is
some
approximately
four
hours
drive
south
of
belanc
(ph)
and
after
a
hearing
in
federal
court,
after
they
bring
him
out
back
to
state
court,
the
martin
theater
changed
and
the
district
attorney
reached
an
agreement
concerning
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
and
martin
theater
agreed
not
to
show
this
particular
film
in
albany
georgia,
and
this
is
not
an
issue
where
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
is
just
rushed
out
for
the
first
time
in
this
particular
case,
but
it
was
in
the
community.
this
was
an
issue
in
the
motion
picture
industry
in
albany,
georgia
sometime
prior
to
that.
in
the
present
case,
prior
to
the
matter
coming
up
for
trial,
the
court
would
notice
that
there
were
number
of
demerits
file
to
the
indictment
or
accusation
as
such
and
there
were
six
of
these
demertis
that
prior
to
attacking
the
accusation.
at
the
trial
itself
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
was
shown
by
the
state.
the
state
rested.
there
were
other
evidence
presented
by
the
defense
in
this
particular
instance
of
other
books
and
it
settled
only
local
market
which
the
georgia
court
disposed
off,
saying
it
would
not
be
relevant
to
judge
one
by
some
other
particular
matter,
but
there
was
little
else,
the
only
other
thing
that
came
in,
touching
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
was
the
unsworn
statement
of
the
defendant
stating
that
this
was
being
shown
or
had
been
scheduled
to
be
shown
in
several
places
in
georgia
and
our
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
has
been
acclaimed
as
one
of
the
particular
pictures.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
under
new
georgia
law,
you
can
not
by
the
use
of
an
unsworn
statement,
introduce
evidence
and
make
it
admissible
or
appropriate
value
for
the
jury
to
the
use
of
an
unsworn
statement.
there
are
other
means
to
get
this
material
in
evidence.
to
bring
in
any
critical
reviews,
anything
that
would
go
to
show
other
facets
as
to
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”.
but
what
the
jury
had
in
this
case,
the
jury
that
had
to
decide
this
issue
was
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
and
this
was
it.
i
think
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
record,
see
this
is
what
they
had
decided
on,
not
any
reviewed
by
the
new
york
times
or
anywhere
else
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
and
they
can
consider
the
defendant
statement,
but
it
can
not
be
used,
sir
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
evidence.
that
would
have
to
be
introduced
in
another
fashion.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
think
it’s
the
point
the
court
considers
and
has
in
the
past
and
could
support
with
core
and
prohibitive
value
in
an
evidence
in
a
particular
case.
the
court
says
that
you
can
believe
his
statements.
his
statements,
his
knowledge
and
etcetera,
but
as
to
the
other
facts,
it
comes
in
and
would
have
to
brought
in
by
some
other
means
such
the
best
evident
proof,
he
can
not
utilize
his
unsworn
statement.
to
introduce
evidence,
i
would
have
to
come
into
another
means.
and
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
problem
because
you
had
a
situation
where
other
evidence
was
introduced.
there
was
no
question
about
him
relying
on
an
unsworn
statement
as
a
sole
purpose.
he
could
have
brought
in
any
other
evidence
in
a
proper
manner
presented
before
the
court.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
sir,
i
think
it’s
quite
a
different
view.
the
jury
--
i
think
the
board
of
censors,
if
you
may
apply
to
maryland
might
sit
down
to
say
we
have
set
a
particular
group.
we
have
made
this
particular
distinction,
when
the
person
having
a
review
from
that
particular
issue
but
on
the
system
of
jurisprudence,
the
jury
is
the
ultimate
triar
of
fact
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
they
looked
at
the
movie.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
this
is
what
the
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
well,
i
think
it
is
just
the
difference
between
the
requirement
--
so,
the
two
of
the
censor
board
would
simply
--
in
my
estimation
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
this
could
be
so
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
no
sir,
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
because
this
is
not
in
our
particular
system.
i
think
what
they’re
doing,
the
court
of
georgia
does
not
have
a
board
of
censors
and
as
maryland
does,
now
i
think
you
have
certain
reviews
for
the
board
of
censors
that
you
do
not
have
from
your
jury.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
we
do
execute
some
--
far
back
we
did,
yes
sir.
but
what
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
is
that,
this
is
the
status
of
the
case
as
it
came
up
and
as
it
left
the
trial
court,
then
we
when
we
came
to
the
appeal,
in
the
case
there
were
basically
two
areas
that
went
into
--
was
gone
into.
the
first
was
the
six
numerous
of
their
--
or
acts
of
the
demur
filed
below,
and
the
only
other
issues
raised
in
the
georgia
courts
were
the
judge
either
failed
to
charge
or
a
charge
of
error
on
part
of
the
judge,
in
fact
did
charge.
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
will
notice
that
as
to
demur
number
one
and
two,
below
these
were
expressively
waived
in
the
georgia
court,
as
to
the
demur
number
six,
this
was
expressively
waived
in
the
georgia
court
on
page
seven
and
none
of
the
appellant
brief.
so,
what
the
court
had
to
forward
in
the
georgia
court
was
an
attack
on
the
demur
or
the
accusation
as
such
saying
that
this
accusation
did
not
include
the
particular
language
of
2101
(b).
this
was
the
attack
in
number
three
and
number
four,
the
attack
was
the
fact
that
the
particular
accusation
did
not
have
--
or
the
statute
which
he
would
base
did
not
have
this
language
contain
therein.
and
the
fifth
one
has
been
dropped
on
the
basis
of
the
paris
adult
theatre
versus
slaton
that
this
court
decided
as
to
the
other
picture
as
to
public
and
non-public
place.
this
is
what
was
raised
in
the
court
above
though
was
simply
the
judges’
charge.
and
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
accusation,
not
the
statute,
but
where
the
accusation
should
have
had
this
particular
language
including
in
the
accusation.
third
is
the
point
that
they
say
that
this
did
not
have
or
the
statute
which
it
was
based,
did
not
have
--
that
the
accusation
was
based
did
not
have
this
language
on
it,
but
at
the
time
of
the
accusation
and
not
the
statute
itself.
the
georgia
courts
in
applying
the
miller
decision
used
the
very
language
of
the
miller
decision.
it
stated
that,
local
or
state
standards,
the
very
--
in
fact
the
very
language
of
this
court
in
the
miller
decision.
the
local
or
state
standards
did
not
go
pass
that
particular
point.
so,
the
state
would
argue
to
the
court
in
this
case
that
there
has
never
been
a
constitutional
attack
on
the
statute
in
the
lower
state
court.
it
has
been
an
attack
on
the
accusation
itself
and
it
has
not
been
attack
on
the
statute
for
being
over
broad
or
being
vague.
now,
an
issue
was
raised
in
that
particular
area
as
i
pointed
out
on
the
fact
that
the
code
section
involved
did
not
include
the
georgia
definition
of
obscenity.
the
court
will
look
at
the
entire
statute
section;
you
will
see
that
it
is
defined
as
the
distributing
obscene
materials
section.
that
in
this
section
2105
is
included
and
the
definition
of
obscenity
is
included
in
the
section
2101
(b)
as
part
of
this
particular
provision.
and
in
2105,
the
georgia
court
require
that
2011,
that
means
that
you
have
to
got
to
go
to
the
indecent
exposure
statute
to
see
what
the
prohibited
act
will
be
on
indecent
exposure,
but
in
this
particular
section,
it
requires
it
and
it
has
to
be
the
distributing
of
obscene
materials.
now,
in
this
area,
the
court
charged
in
the
lower
court.
it
wasn’t
done
in
the
supreme
court
for
the
first
time,
the
lower
court
charged
the
language
of
all
three.
it
told
them
that
charge
would
be
a
crime
of
distributing
obscene
material
that
he
was
charged
for
these
particular
acts
and
then
charged
the
jury
in
very
explicit
language
and
the
court
said
that
the
question
is
not
whether
these
acts
were
done
as
such
but,
if
these
acts
were
in
fact
done,
would
this
be
obscene
under
this
provision
of
distributing
obscene
material.
the
court
charged
him.
there’s
not
the
question
is
not
public
indecency
or
exposure
but
the
question
is
if
these
acts
that
are
depicted
were
done
on
the
screen.
does
this
taken
in
the
view,
the
georgia
statute
and
test
on
obscenity,
does
this
show
that
this
movie
is
obscene
under
those
particular
standards?
in
the
judges’
ruling,
the
jury
so
found
but
to
call
the
court's
attention
first
to
one
point,
there
was
never
any
enumeration
of
errors
raised
in
the
georgia
courts
on
the
general
grounds
that
the
jury
could
not
have
found
this
particular
film
obscene,
under
any
standard
on
the
general
grounds.
in
georgia,
courts
has
liberalized
in
the
last
few
years,
its
rules
on
bringing
them
out
before
them,
saying
that
anytime
the
before
oral
argument
or
before
the
court
decides
the
issue
that
any
defect
in
the
enumerations
area,
or
the
notice
to
appeal
can
be
upheld
in
that
particular
time,
and
there
was
never
an
attack
made
or
any
charge
made
in
the
georgia
courts
that
this
film
was
not
obscene,
it
was
never
an
issue
raised
in
the
georgia
courts.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
think
if
the
court
would
review
the
enumeration,
where
you
find
that
there
were
a
number
of
situations
where
the
request
was
that
the
judge
erred
in
making
this
particular
charge,
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
evidence,
to
support
any
such
charge
or
any
such
finding
by
the
jury.
and
the
court,
below
in
the
majority
opinion,
i
don’t
believe
the
court
of
georgia
has
any
problem
stating
the
film,
where
something
is,
this
is
obscene,
and
we
find
this
to
be
obscene.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
says
after
reviewing
the
record
and
reviewing
on
this
court
we
affirm.
holds
the
record
in
this
case
amply
supports
the
verdict
of
guilty
showing
that
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
in
violation
of
distributing
obscene
material.
and
what
i
am
saying
in
this
court
now
is
this
was
an
issue
that
has
not
been
raised
below
in
the
george
courts
by
the
appellant
in
the
proper
manner.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
he
suggests
this.
what
i
would
suggest
back
is
that
the
court
did
not
reach
this
particular
point
because
it
was
not
an
issue,
but
it
did
reach
the
issues
that
were
raised
below
and
that
was
whether
the
jury
could
on
a
basis
of
the
charge
that
the
court
find
that
this
were
included
in
the
film
itself.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
no
sir.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
said
we
affirm
the
jury’s
finding
of
guilty.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes,
sir.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
found
guilty
of
the
distribution
of
obscene
material.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes,
sir.
but
this
issue
is
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
was
not
raised
below
and
the
court
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
no
sir.
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
sir.
it’s
that
the
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
think
what
the
georgia
court
said
was
to
go
and
back
and
look
at
issues
that
were
before
them,
that
they
had
to
make
such
a
ruling
on.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes,
but
i
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes,
sir.
the
ruling
they
made
is
before
you,
yes.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
the
issue
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
made
a
determination,
if
the
court
place.
the
georgia
rules
of
the
enumeration
there
that
you
have
to
delineate
the
issues
that
you
are
appealing
upon
for
the
court
to
reach
a
determination
at
this
court.
this
issue
was
not
ever
raised
by
any
enumeration
of
error
at
any
time,
prior
to
the
court’s
determination.
now
if
the
court
can
say
that
by
affirming
the
jury’s
findings
in
this
fact,
this
does
decide
the
issue
of
obscenity
and
that
would
be
this
court’s
decision
that
they
did
reach
that
particular
point.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
think
you
could
reach
that
assumption
on
what
i
am
saying
to
this
court
is
that,
this
was
not
an
issue
raised
and
brought
before
that
court
as
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
in
my
opinion
maybe
wrong,
but
this
is
what
i
read
in
the
entire
facts
in
going
back
to
the
entire
view
of
the
thing
is
that
issues
were
raised
as
to
the
request
of
charge
that
the
court
had
to
find
them
certain
evidence,
where
it
was
available
for
the
jury
to
consider
on
other
matters
that
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
obscenity.
well,
if
this
is
wrong
then
it
would
be
--
if
i’m
wrong
then
it
would
be
considered
in
this
court.
in
any
case
the
state
below,
or
the
georgia
supreme
court
below
stated
that
as
they
have
done
in
number
of
cases
as
in
the
miller
versus
california
case,
the
test
of
obscenity
is
another
provision.
it’s
not
in
the
same
provision
it
would
charge
with.
a
definition
section
is
otherwise.
in
georgia
you
also
have
in
murder
cases,
situations
as
to
murder,
you
have
got
some
other
sections
that
go
and
limit
murder.
when
you
get
into
question
that
would
justify
a
homicide
which
would
apply
in
particular
case.
in
this
case,
the
georgia
court
said
only
that
in
2105,
since
this
was
on
the
distributing
of
obscene
materials,
the
entire
code
section
had
to
be
considered
together,
which
included
the
definition
of
obscenity
in
2101
(b).
in
that
particular
probation
it
just
delineated
the
georgia
obscenity
test
and
incorporated
that
as
part
of
the
2105.
now,
this
is
not
a
new
rule
and
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
something
that
brought
out
for
this
case.
this
has
been
the
same
thing
for
a
number
of
years
where
they
say
that
they
have
to
consider
the
entire
code
section
and
not
just
pull
out
one
section,
if
you
are
to
construe
this,
it
covers
the
same
basic
materials.
and
the
georgia
court
consider
them
together
and
we
urge
to
the
court
that
this
decides,
if
the
court
did
reach
the
question
of
obscenity
as
to
2105,
that
this
does
cover
that
particular
material
on
non-federal
grounds.
so,
the
state
court
has
so
construed
and
included
in
the
definition
of
obscenity
2105
and
the
2101
(b)
together
and
should
solve
that
particular
matter.
the
only
other
thing
raised
below
other
that
the
charge
itself,
not
only
as
i
pointed
out
before
was
waived
on
page
seven,
they
made
an
issue
that
the
use
of
the
word
knowingly
in
2102
was
not
appropriately
done
and
was
specifically
waived.
but
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
court
pleases,
there
was
no
attack
below
on
the
georgia
statute
involved
here,
on
the
question
of
over
breadth
of
the
particular
statute
or
any
vagueness
on
the
statute.
this
was
not
raised
before
the
georgia
courts.
there’s
nothing
in
the
georgia
courts’
determination
of
the
case
as
to
vagueness.
getting
into
the
area
of
due
process,
if
the
court
pleases.
in
this
particular
area,
the
georgia,
of
course
as
i
pointed
out
acquiest
to
the
factual
situation,
this
is
not
something
that
just
simply
jumped
out
at
these
individual
at
least
onetime.
this
is
something
that
had
been
pending
in
albany,
georgia
for
sometime.
the
statute
was
on
the
book
and
the
same
statute
that
had
been
applied
previously
in
the
martin
theater’s
case.
the
georgia
courts
and
has
previously
said
much
before
that
point
is
that
this,
in
each
case
when
you
got
a
code
section
that
pertains
to
the
same
matter,
that
you
have
to
construe
the
entire
code
section
together
to
reach
a
determination
as
to
what
the
contents
would
be.
and
the
court
recently
say
that
on
2105
and
it
falls
on
the
area
of
distributing
obscene
material
applies
that
the
definition
that
is
given
in
the
code
section
on
distributing
obscene
material
would
apply
in
that
particular
case.
and
this
is
what
they
did
in
that
particular
case
and
it
was
not
an
unforeseen
or
something
that
would
not
particularly
come
out
in
that
particular
area.
going
into
to
several
areas,
if
the
court
pleases.
first,
particularly
in
the
area
of
national
standards
as
oppose,
as
to
local
standards,
the
only
issue
raised
below
as
to
any
type
of
standard
was
the
question
whether
the
trial
court
erred
in
charging
national
versus
local
standards.
there
was
no
issue
raised
at
all
anywhere
as
to
a
state
versus
local.
in
the
georgia
court,
in
the
trial
court
refused
to
charge
national
standards.
the
court
did
charge
in
that
particular
instance,
the
same
community
standard
that
has
been
the
test
says,
since
memoirs
uses
the
--
in
the
community
that
is
say
local
community,
they
used
the
same
language
that
has
been
used
throughout
most
of
the
nation
as
to
community
standard,
but
it
didn’t
define
that
it’s
local.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
georgia
court
did
not
reach
the
issue
again
because
there
was
no
issue
raised
as
to
state
or
local,
the
court
simply
held
the
trial
court
was
correct,
when
it
said
that
national
standards
would
not
apply.
and
this
is
the
only
issue
as
to
state
versus
local
standards
raised
below,
whereas
to
local
versus
national.
there
was
nothing
that’s
raised
here.
i
think
the
thrust
of
the
state’s
argument,
if
the
court
please,
is
basically
is
that
all
the
points
raised
here
are
raised
ab
initio,
before
this
court
for
the
first
time.
that
they
were
not
properly
raised
below
in
the
state
court,
that
the
state
court
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
pass
upon
them
in
the
issue
they
are
now
raised.
the
state
court
didn’t
meet
the
objection
raised
in
the
local
state
court.
now,
i
think
if
the
court
look
at
the
difference
in
the
enumerations
of
error,
in
the
arguments
made
below
to
the
state
court
and
the
arguments
made
at
this
time
at
this
court.
the
court
will
see
there
two,
entirely
different
set
of
arguments
and
a
complete
new
set
of
points
that
are
being
raised
for
this
time.
one
further
thing
i’d
like
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention
is
the
question
as
to
the
jury.
we
feel
that
in
the
miller
case,
the
court,
for
the
first
time
placed
the
obscenity
area
in
a
situation
where
the
jury
would
make
a
determination
as
to
standards
that
judge
had
found.
to
eliminate
a
lot
of
review
by
the
jury
having
a
standard
that
worked
very
much
like
your
reasonable
man
theory,
where
the
jury
would
make
a
determination
in
the
court
having
the
opportunity
to
review
if
there
is
a
constitutional
question
involved,
the
court
then
reaching
it
on
that
particular
case
and
on
those
limited
number
of
cases.
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
court
has
delineated
the
fact
that
local
or
state
standards
applies
and
that
the
jury
has
an
important
part,
makes
a
great
step
forward
in
the
area
of
the
obscenity
cases.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
like
to,
if
i
may,
go
back
a
little
further
in
the
chronology
of
the
case
to
point
out
that
sometime
prior
to
the
instant
case
in
a
case
involving
martin
theaters
which
you
will
find
on
page
66
of
the
record
below,
some
remark
brought
to
at
the
same
film
“carnal
knowledge”
was
involved
in
city
of
albany,
georgia
which
is
some
approximately
four
hours
drive
south
of
belanc
(ph)
and
after
a
hearing
in
federal
court,
after
they
bring
him
out
back
to
state
court,
the
martin
theater
changed
and
the
district
attorney
reached
an
agreement
concerning
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
and
martin
theater
agreed
not
to
show
this
particular
film
in
albany
georgia,
and
this
is
not
an
issue
where
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
is
just
rushed
out
for
the
first
time
in
this
particular
case,
but
it
was
in
the
community.
this
was
an
issue
in
the
motion
picture
industry
in
albany,
georgia
sometime
prior
to
that.
in
the
present
case,
prior
to
the
matter
coming
up
for
trial,
the
court
would
notice
that
there
were
number
of
demerits
file
to
the
indictment
or
accusation
as
such
and
there
were
six
of
these
demertis
that
prior
to
attacking
the
accusation.
at
the
trial
itself
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
was
shown
by
the
state.
the
state
rested.
there
were
other
evidence
presented
by
the
defense
in
this
particular
instance
of
other
books
and
it
settled
only
local
market
which
the
georgia
court
disposed
off,
saying
it
would
not
be
relevant
to
judge
one
by
some
other
particular
matter,
but
there
was
little
else,
the
only
other
thing
that
came
in,
touching
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
was
the
unsworn
statement
of
the
defendant
stating
that
this
was
being
shown
or
had
been
scheduled
to
be
shown
in
several
places
in
georgia
and
our
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
has
been
acclaimed
as
one
of
the
particular
pictures.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
under
new
georgia
law,
you
can
not
by
the
use
of
an
unsworn
statement,
introduce
evidence
and
make
it
admissible
or
appropriate
value
for
the
jury
to
the
use
of
an
unsworn
statement.
there
are
other
means
to
get
this
material
in
evidence.
to
bring
in
any
critical
reviews,
anything
that
would
go
to
show
other
facets
as
to
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”.
but
what
the
jury
had
in
this
case,
the
jury
that
had
to
decide
this
issue
was
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
and
this
was
it.
i
think
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
record,
see
this
is
what
they
had
decided
on,
not
any
reviewed
by
the
new
york
times
or
anywhere
else
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
and
they
can
consider
the
defendant
statement,
but
it
can
not
be
used,
sir
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
evidence.
that
would
have
to
be
introduced
in
another
fashion.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
think
it’s
the
point
the
court
considers
and
has
in
the
past
and
could
support
with
core
and
prohibitive
value
in
an
evidence
in
a
particular
case.
the
court
says
that
you
can
believe
his
statements.
his
statements,
his
knowledge
and
etcetera,
but
as
to
the
other
facts,
it
comes
in
and
would
have
to
brought
in
by
some
other
means
such
the
best
evident
proof,
he
can
not
utilize
his
unsworn
statement.
to
introduce
evidence,
i
would
have
to
come
into
another
means.
and
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
problem
because
you
had
a
situation
where
other
evidence
was
introduced.
there
was
no
question
about
him
relying
on
an
unsworn
statement
as
a
sole
purpose.
he
could
have
brought
in
any
other
evidence
in
a
proper
manner
presented
before
the
court.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
sir,
i
think
it’s
quite
a
different
view.
the
jury
--
i
think
the
board
of
censors,
if
you
may
apply
to
maryland
might
sit
down
to
say
we
have
set
a
particular
group.
we
have
made
this
particular
distinction,
when
the
person
having
a
review
from
that
particular
issue
but
on
the
system
of
jurisprudence,
the
jury
is
the
ultimate
triar
of
fact
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
they
looked
at
the
movie.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
this
is
what
the
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
well,
i
think
it
is
just
the
difference
between
the
requirement
--
so,
the
two
of
the
censor
board
would
simply
--
in
my
estimation
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
this
could
be
so
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
no
sir,
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
because
this
is
not
in
our
particular
system.
i
think
what
they’re
doing,
the
court
of
georgia
does
not
have
a
board
of
censors
and
as
maryland
does,
now
i
think
you
have
certain
reviews
for
the
board
of
censors
that
you
do
not
have
from
your
jury.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
we
do
execute
some
--
far
back
we
did,
yes
sir.
but
what
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
is
that,
this
is
the
status
of
the
case
as
it
came
up
and
as
it
left
the
trial
court,
then
we
when
we
came
to
the
appeal,
in
the
case
there
were
basically
two
areas
that
went
into
--
was
gone
into.
the
first
was
the
six
numerous
of
their
--
or
acts
of
the
demur
filed
below,
and
the
only
other
issues
raised
in
the
georgia
courts
were
the
judge
either
failed
to
charge
or
a
charge
of
error
on
part
of
the
judge,
in
fact
did
charge.
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
will
notice
that
as
to
demur
number
one
and
two,
below
these
were
expressively
waived
in
the
georgia
court,
as
to
the
demur
number
six,
this
was
expressively
waived
in
the
georgia
court
on
page
seven
and
none
of
the
appellant
brief.
so,
what
the
court
had
to
forward
in
the
georgia
court
was
an
attack
on
the
demur
or
the
accusation
as
such
saying
that
this
accusation
did
not
include
the
particular
language
of
2101
(b).
this
was
the
attack
in
number
three
and
number
four,
the
attack
was
the
fact
that
the
particular
accusation
did
not
have
--
or
the
statute
which
he
would
base
did
not
have
this
language
contain
therein.
and
the
fifth
one
has
been
dropped
on
the
basis
of
the
paris
adult
theatre
versus
slaton
that
this
court
decided
as
to
the
other
picture
as
to
public
and
non-public
place.
this
is
what
was
raised
in
the
court
above
though
was
simply
the
judges’
charge.
and
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
accusation,
not
the
statute,
but
where
the
accusation
should
have
had
this
particular
language
including
in
the
accusation.
third
is
the
point
that
they
say
that
this
did
not
have
or
the
statute
which
it
was
based,
did
not
have
--
that
the
accusation
was
based
did
not
have
this
language
on
it,
but
at
the
time
of
the
accusation
and
not
the
statute
itself.
the
georgia
courts
in
applying
the
miller
decision
used
the
very
language
of
the
miller
decision.
it
stated
that,
local
or
state
standards,
the
very
--
in
fact
the
very
language
of
this
court
in
the
miller
decision.
the
local
or
state
standards
did
not
go
pass
that
particular
point.
so,
the
state
would
argue
to
the
court
in
this
case
that
there
has
never
been
a
constitutional
attack
on
the
statute
in
the
lower
state
court.
it
has
been
an
attack
on
the
accusation
itself
and
it
has
not
been
attack
on
the
statute
for
being
over
broad
or
being
vague.
now,
an
issue
was
raised
in
that
particular
area
as
i
pointed
out
on
the
fact
that
the
code
section
involved
did
not
include
the
georgia
definition
of
obscenity.
the
court
will
look
at
the
entire
statute
section;
you
will
see
that
it
is
defined
as
the
distributing
obscene
materials
section.
that
in
this
section
2105
is
included
and
the
definition
of
obscenity
is
included
in
the
section
2101
(b)
as
part
of
this
particular
provision.
and
in
2105,
the
georgia
court
require
that
2011,
that
means
that
you
have
to
got
to
go
to
the
indecent
exposure
statute
to
see
what
the
prohibited
act
will
be
on
indecent
exposure,
but
in
this
particular
section,
it
requires
it
and
it
has
to
be
the
distributing
of
obscene
materials.
now,
in
this
area,
the
court
charged
in
the
lower
court.
it
wasn’t
done
in
the
supreme
court
for
the
first
time,
the
lower
court
charged
the
language
of
all
three.
it
told
them
that
charge
would
be
a
crime
of
distributing
obscene
material
that
he
was
charged
for
these
particular
acts
and
then
charged
the
jury
in
very
explicit
language
and
the
court
said
that
the
question
is
not
whether
these
acts
were
done
as
such
but,
if
these
acts
were
in
fact
done,
would
this
be
obscene
under
this
provision
of
distributing
obscene
material.
the
court
charged
him.
there’s
not
the
question
is
not
public
indecency
or
exposure
but
the
question
is
if
these
acts
that
are
depicted
were
done
on
the
screen.
does
this
taken
in
the
view,
the
georgia
statute
and
test
on
obscenity,
does
this
show
that
this
movie
is
obscene
under
those
particular
standards?
in
the
judges’
ruling,
the
jury
so
found
but
to
call
the
court's
attention
first
to
one
point,
there
was
never
any
enumeration
of
errors
raised
in
the
georgia
courts
on
the
general
grounds
that
the
jury
could
not
have
found
this
particular
film
obscene,
under
any
standard
on
the
general
grounds.
in
georgia,
courts
has
liberalized
in
the
last
few
years,
its
rules
on
bringing
them
out
before
them,
saying
that
anytime
the
before
oral
argument
or
before
the
court
decides
the
issue
that
any
defect
in
the
enumerations
area,
or
the
notice
to
appeal
can
be
upheld
in
that
particular
time,
and
there
was
never
an
attack
made
or
any
charge
made
in
the
georgia
courts
that
this
film
was
not
obscene,
it
was
never
an
issue
raised
in
the
georgia
courts.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
think
if
the
court
would
review
the
enumeration,
where
you
find
that
there
were
a
number
of
situations
where
the
request
was
that
the
judge
erred
in
making
this
particular
charge,
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
evidence,
to
support
any
such
charge
or
any
such
finding
by
the
jury.
and
the
court,
below
in
the
majority
opinion,
i
don’t
believe
the
court
of
georgia
has
any
problem
stating
the
film,
where
something
is,
this
is
obscene,
and
we
find
this
to
be
obscene.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
says
after
reviewing
the
record
and
reviewing
on
this
court
we
affirm.
holds
the
record
in
this
case
amply
supports
the
verdict
of
guilty
showing
that
the
film
“carnal
knowledge”
in
violation
of
distributing
obscene
material.
and
what
i
am
saying
in
this
court
now
is
this
was
an
issue
that
has
not
been
raised
below
in
the
george
courts
by
the
appellant
in
the
proper
manner.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
he
suggests
this.
what
i
would
suggest
back
is
that
the
court
did
not
reach
this
particular
point
because
it
was
not
an
issue,
but
it
did
reach
the
issues
that
were
raised
below
and
that
was
whether
the
jury
could
on
a
basis
of
the
charge
that
the
court
find
that
this
were
included
in
the
film
itself.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
no
sir.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
said
we
affirm
the
jury’s
finding
of
guilty.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes,
sir.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
found
guilty
of
the
distribution
of
obscene
material.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes,
sir.
but
this
issue
is
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
was
not
raised
below
and
the
court
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
no
sir.
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
sir.
it’s
that
the
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
think
what
the
georgia
court
said
was
to
go
and
back
and
look
at
issues
that
were
before
them,
that
they
had
to
make
such
a
ruling
on.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes,
but
i
--
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes,
sir.
the
ruling
they
made
is
before
you,
yes.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
the
issue
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
made
a
determination,
if
the
court
place.
the
georgia
rules
of
the
enumeration
there
that
you
have
to
delineate
the
issues
that
you
are
appealing
upon
for
the
court
to
reach
a
determination
at
this
court.
this
issue
was
not
ever
raised
by
any
enumeration
of
error
at
any
time,
prior
to
the
court’s
determination.
now
if
the
court
can
say
that
by
affirming
the
jury’s
findings
in
this
fact,
this
does
decide
the
issue
of
obscenity
and
that
would
be
this
court’s
decision
that
they
did
reach
that
particular
point.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
i
think
you
could
reach
that
assumption
on
what
i
am
saying
to
this
court
is
that,
this
was
not
an
issue
raised
and
brought
before
that
court
as
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
tony
h.
hight
yes
sir,
in
my
opinion
maybe
wrong,
but
this
is
what
i
read
in
the
entire
facts
in
going
back
to
the
entire
view
of
the
thing
is
that
issues
were
raised
as
to
the
request
of
charge
that
the
court
had
to
find
them
certain
evidence,
where
it
was
available
for
the
jury
to
consider
on
other
matters
that
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
obscenity.
well,
if
this
is
wrong
then
it
would
be
--
if
i’m
wrong
then
it
would
be
considered
in
this
court.
in
any
case
the
state
below,
or
the
georgia
supreme
court
below
stated
that
as
they
have
done
in
number
of
cases
as
in
the
miller
versus
california
case,
the
test
of
obscenity
is
another
provision.
it’s
not
in
the
same
provision
it
would
charge
with.
a
definition
section
is
otherwise.
in
georgia
you
also
have
in
murder
cases,
situations
as
to
murder,
you
have
got
some
other
sections
that
go
and
limit
murder.
when
you
get
into
question
that
would
justify
a
homicide
which
would
apply
in
particular
case.
in
this
case,
the
georgia
court
said
only
that
in
2105,
since
this
was
on
the
distributing
of
obscene
materials,
the
entire
code
section
had
to
be
considered
together,
which
included
the
definition
of
obscenity
in
2101
(b).
in
that
particular
probation
it
just
delineated
the
georgia
obscenity
test
and
incorporated
that
as
part
of
the
2105.
now,
this
is
not
a
new
rule
and
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
something
that
brought
out
for
this
case.
this
has
been
the
same
thing
for
a
number
of
years
where
they
say
that
they
have
to
consider
the
entire
code
section
and
not
just
pull
out
one
section,
if
you
are
to
construe
this,
it
covers
the
same
basic
materials.
and
the
georgia
court
consider
them
together
and
we
urge
to
the
court
that
this
decides,
if
the
court
did
reach
the
question
of
obscenity
as
to
2105,
that
this
does
cover
that
particular
material
on
non-federal
grounds.
so,
the
state
court
has
so
construed
and
included
in
the
definition
of
obscenity
2105
and
the
2101
(b)
together
and
should
solve
that
particular
matter.
the
only
other
thing
raised
below
other
that
the
charge
itself,
not
only
as
i
pointed
out
before
was
waived
on
page
seven,
they
made
an
issue
that
the
use
of
the
word
knowingly
in
2102
was
not
appropriately
done
and
was
specifically
waived.
but
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
court
pleases,
there
was
no
attack
below
on
the
georgia
statute
involved
here,
on
the
question
of
over
breadth
of
the
particular
statute
or
any
vagueness
on
the
statute.
this
was
not
raised
before
the
georgia
courts.
there’s
nothing
in
the
georgia
courts’
determination
of
the
case
as
to
vagueness.
getting
into
the
area
of
due
process,
if
the
court
pleases.
in
this
particular
area,
the
georgia,
of
course
as
i
pointed
out
acquiest
to
the
factual
situation,
this
is
not
something
that
just
simply
jumped
out
at
these
individual
at
least
onetime.
this
is
something
that
had
been
pending
in
albany,
georgia
for
sometime.
the
statute
was
on
the
book
and
the
same
statute
that
had
been
applied
previously
in
the
martin
theater’s
case.
the
georgia
courts
and
has
previously
said
much
before
that
point
is
that
this,
in
each
case
when
you
got
a
code
section
that
pertains
to
the
same
matter,
that
you
have
to
construe
the
entire
code
section
together
to
reach
a
determination
as
to
what
the
contents
would
be.
and
the
court
recently
say
that
on
2105
and
it
falls
on
the
area
of
distributing
obscene
material
applies
that
the
definition
that
is
given
in
the
code
section
on
distributing
obscene
material
would
apply
in
that
particular
case.
and
this
is
what
they
did
in
that
particular
case
and
it
was
not
an
unforeseen
or
something
that
would
not
particularly
come
out
in
that
particular
area.
going
into
to
several
areas,
if
the
court
pleases.
first,
particularly
in
the
area
of
national
standards
as
oppose,
as
to
local
standards,
the
only
issue
raised
below
as
to
any
type
of
standard
was
the
question
whether
the
trial
court
erred
in
charging
national
versus
local
standards.
there
was
no
issue
raised
at
all
anywhere
as
to
a
state
versus
local.
in
the
georgia
court,
in
the
trial
court
refused
to
charge
national
standards.
the
court
did
charge
in
that
particular
instance,
the
same
community
standard
that
has
been
the
test
says,
since
memoirs
uses
the
--
in
the
community
that
is
say
local
community,
they
used
the
same
language
that
has
been
used
throughout
most
of
the
nation
as
to
community
standard,
but
it
didn’t
define
that
it’s
local.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
georgia
court
did
not
reach
the
issue
again
because
there
was
no
issue
raised
as
to
state
or
local,
the
court
simply
held
the
trial
court
was
correct,
when
it
said
that
national
standards
would
not
apply.
and
this
is
the
only
issue
as
to
state
versus
local
standards
raised
below,
whereas
to
local
versus
national.
there
was
nothing
that’s
raised
here.
i
think
the
thrust
of
the
state’s
argument,
if
the
court
please,
is
basically
is
that
all
the
points
raised
here
are
raised
ab
initio,
before
this
court
for
the
first
time.
that
they
were
not
properly
raised
below
in
the
state
court,
that
the
state
court
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
pass
upon
them
in
the
issue
they
are
now
raised.
the
state
court
didn’t
meet
the
objection
raised
in
the
local
state
court.
now,
i
think
if
the
court
look
at
the
difference
in
the
enumerations
of
error,
in
the
arguments
made
below
to
the
state
court
and
the
arguments
made
at
this
time
at
this
court.
the
court
will
see
there
two,
entirely
different
set
of
arguments
and
a
complete
new
set
of
points
that
are
being
raised
for
this
time.
one
further
thing
i’d
like
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention
is
the
question
as
to
the
jury.
we
feel
that
in
the
miller
case,
the
court,
for
the
first
time
placed
the
obscenity
area
in
a
situation
where
the
jury
would
make
a
determination
as
to
standards
that
judge
had
found.
to
eliminate
a
lot
of
review
by
the
jury
having
a
standard
that
worked
very
much
like
your
reasonable
man
theory,
where
the
jury
would
make
a
determination
in
the
court
having
the
opportunity
to
review
if
there
is
a
constitutional
question
involved,
the
court
then
reaching
it
on
that
particular
case
and
on
those
limited
number
of
cases.
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
court
has
delineated
the
fact
that
local
or
state
standards
applies
and
that
the
jury
has
an
important
part,
makes
a
great
step
forward
in
the
area
of
the
obscenity
cases.
