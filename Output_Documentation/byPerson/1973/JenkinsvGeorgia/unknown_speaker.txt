well,
i
also
read
the
miller
decision
even
though
i
didn’t
join
it
and
it
talked
about
local
standards
and
i’d
rather
gather
that
that
was
self-defining,
that
the
jurisdiction
from
which
the
jury
came

was
trying

excuse
me
for
interrupting,

i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
court
instructed
the
jury

it
could
believe
the
unsworn
statement
entirely
if
it
so
desire.
unknown
speaker
it
could
tell
the
jury
that
you
may
believe
it
entirely

true.

what’s
the
difference
between
that
and
evidence?
unknown

mr.
hight,
what
was
difference
in
the
role
of
the
jury
in
this
case
and
the
board
of
censors?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this
just
recommends
that
the
georgia
court
actually
decided
the
question
anyway.
i
mean
that
if
they
dealt
with
the
