well,
justice
stewart
just
suggested
however
the
city
arguments
vary,
for
example,
on
the
first
amendment
area
of
parade
permits
and
the
many
types
of
demonstrations,
do
they
not?
chief

warren
e.
burger
your
argument
seems
to
run
a
little
bit
counter
to
the
traditional
idea
and
maybe
reject
the
traditional
idea
that
the
jury
is
the
conscience
of
the
community
from
which
it’s
gone.

and
rather
brief
charge
which
embraces
a
large
part
of
the
relatively
brief
charge
of
the
court,
at
least
the
jury.
i
note
that
the
word
obscene
and
obscene
conduct
appears
five
times
at
least.
i
might
have
missed
some,
so
the
judge
certainly
submitted
the
issue
of
obscenity
to
the
jury.
