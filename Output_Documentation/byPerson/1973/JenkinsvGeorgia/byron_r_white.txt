justice

r.

mr.
nizer,
can
i
ask
--
i
believe,
let’s
assume
you’re
correct
in
saying
that
under
miller,
a
movie
would
not
be
obscene
unless
and
it
was
“hard
core”
or
let
me
assume
that
it’s
“hard
core”,
whatever
you
might
mean
by
“hard
core”.
if
that
is
so,
doesn’t
the
good
deal
of
the
argument
about
local
or
the
national
standards
wash
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there’s
hardly
any
room
then
for
a
local
standard
could
be
whatever
the
local
standard
might
be
but
if
a
work
didn’t
happen
to
be
“hard
core”
the
work
wouldn’t
been
obscene.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
“hard
core”
standard,
if
that
is
the
standard
is
a
national
standard,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
a
first
amendment
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
again
i
just
suggest
that
if
it’s
“hard
core”
pornography
and
it
is
that
miller
limits
obscenity
definition
to
the
argument
about
national
and
local
standard,
you
are
beside
the
point.
