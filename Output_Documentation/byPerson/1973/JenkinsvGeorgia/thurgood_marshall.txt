what
would
you
do
on
the
state
area
if
the
case
rolled
out
in
texas
and
alaska?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’re
not
--
will
you
put
it
on
size,
the
number
of
people
or
--?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
geographical
areas
solely.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
that
does
not
even
build
the
number
of
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
they
look
at
the
movie?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
decided
it’s
obscene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
what
if
suppose
the
censor
board
is
looking
at
the
movie
and
saying
it’s
obscene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
censor
board
will
say
you
shouldn’t
do
it,
and
this
the
jury
says,
you
go
to
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
performed
the
same
function.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
can’t
you
take
the
board
of
censors
to
say
that
the
picture
is
obscene,
the
man
goes
to
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
have
a
board
of
censors.
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn’t
the
court
say
it
was
obscene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
the
court
says
that
the
jury
found
this
obscene
and
we
affirm.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
jury’s
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
the
jury
find?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
that
judge
with
affirmance
on
the
question
of
obscenity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
now
that
the
georgia
court
has
passed
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
though
the
georgia
court
passed
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
did!
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
ruling
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
do
on
the

justice
thurgood

now,
what
