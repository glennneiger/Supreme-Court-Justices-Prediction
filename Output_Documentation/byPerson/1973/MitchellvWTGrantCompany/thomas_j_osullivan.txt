mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
which
though
the
petitioner
claims
the
denial
of
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
regarding
the
taking
of
his
property
there
has
in
fact
already
been
a
hearing
in
that
regard.
the
petitioner
has
been
heard
and
his
contentions
have
been
decided
adversely
to
him.
one
point
i
might
make
right
off
the
bat,
your
honor,
is
that
this
case
arose
prior
to
the
time
that
the
decision
had
been
rendered
in
the
fuentes
case
and
the
trial
court's
determination
was
made
at
a
time
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
fuentes
case.
in
terms
of
the
arguments
in
the
briefs,
i
submit
that
there
are
two
basic
areas
of
dispute
between
the
parties
with
respect
to
louisiana
law.
the
first
of
those
areas
is
as
to
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
hearing
which
has
been
had
in
this
case.
in
the
second
area
of
dispute
is
with
respect
to
the
rule
of
the
court
which
issues
the
writ
of
sequestration.
now,
in
the
argument
that’s
preceded,
there
has
been
no
discussion
of
that
rule
and
i
think
that
there
should
be
a
fuller
development.
but
first,
i’d
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
hearing
that
has
been
had
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
comes
before
this
court
and
is
not
in
a
position
to
assert
an
injury.
the
fuentes
case
was
designed
to
prevent
mistaken,
unjustified
or
wrongful
deprivations
of
property
and
that
has
not
happened
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
has
had
a
hearing
albeit
after
the
property
was
taken
from
his
possession
and
he’s
been
heard
in
that
regard.
now,
as
to
the
nature
of
that
hearing,
this
was
a
hearing
that
was
brought
on
by
the
petitioner
to
set
aside
the
writ
of
sequestration
in
an
endeavor
to
obtain
the
return
of
the
property.
now,
the
petitioner
in
essence
claims
that
he
was
not
able
to
go
into
the
merits
of
the
case
at
that
time,
but
in
fact,
the
petitioner
was
able
to
cause
the
court,
the
louisiana
court
to
explore
into
the
grounds
for
the
issuance
of
what’s
referred
to
as
the
auxiliary
remedy.
there
is
a
comment
that
the
petitioner
has
referred
to
in
his
brief
to
the
effect
that
at
that
hearing
the
merits
may
not
be
inquired
into.
in
fact,
we
submit
that
any
significant
defense
can
be
raised
at
that
hearing
and
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
22
through
25
amply
demonstrate
that
in
cases
in
which
a
motion
has
been
brought
on
to
dissolve
a
writ
of
sequestration,
the
court
has
inquired
into
issues
that
go
to
the
merits
and
that
is
because
the
burden
of
proof
at
such
a
hearing
has
been
placed
on
the
party
that
caused
the
goods
to
be
seized
in
the
first
instance.
in
short,
the
burden
was
on
the
respondent
at
that
hearing
to
demonstrate
that
the
property
was
properly
seized.
now,
in
addition
at
that
hearing,
after
the
property
had
been
taken,
there
was
a
stipulation
entered
into
by
the
parties
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
valid
vendor’s
lien
on
the
property.
now,
in
short,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
petitioner
purchased
property
and
then
having
gone
into
default
after
the
property
was
seized,
came
into
the
court
and
admitted
that
there
was
a
valid
vendor’s
lien
on
that
property.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
that’s
so.
in
the
event
that
there
was
not
a
balance
due,
there
would
be
no
such
vendor’s
lien.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
that’s
so
but
beyond
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well
your
honor,
the
allegations
in
the
petition,
in
the
initial
affidavit
pursuant
to
which
this
action
was
commenced
were
to
the
effect
that
the
balance
was
unpaid
and
was
due
and
that
has
never
been
contested
nor
contradicted
and
it
could’ve
been
contested
and
contradicted.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir,
but
there
has
--
i
submit,
there
has
been
a
finding
to
that
effect
implicit
in
the
decision
of
the
court
at
the
hearing
to
set
aside
the
writ
of
sequestration.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
that’s
true.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no,
i
think
that
it
goes
to
something
more
than
that
because
it’s
an
admission
that
it
has
not
been
extinguished,
that
its
still,
that
it
has
not
been
extinguished,
that
it’s
still
in
existence
as
of
the
time
that
the
case
has
come
on
for
a
hearing
before
the
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
think
that
it
goes
beyond
that.
i
think
that
it
implicitly
meets
that
there
aren’t
defenses
of
such
in
nature
as
would
extinguish
that
vendor’s
lien.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir.
i
would
think
that
that
would
not
be
so.
i
think
that
we
have
cited
case
law
in
our
brief
to
that
effect
that
for
example
with
discharge
or
with
innovation
or
with
--
in
the
past
giving
of
notes,
a
vendor’s
lien
might
be
extinguished.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir
we
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
exactly
so
sir.
now
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
that
is
a
correct
statement.
i
think
that
my
brother’s
argument
goes
a
little
bit
further.
i
think
that
he
takes
the
position
that
there
was
not
a
final
determination
on
the
merits
as
to
the
ultimate
right
of
possession
of
the
property.
with
that
argument,
i’m
in
agreement.
there
was
no
such
final
determination.
the
property
so
to
speak
is
still
in
limbo.
there
has
not
been
a
final
judgment
in
this
case
but
i
would
submit
that
the
fuentes
case
does
not
require
an
initial
threshold
preliminary
ultimate
determination
of
the
right
to
the
possession
of
property.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
in
essence,
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
at
that
hearing
there
is
an
inquiry
into
the
probable
validity
of
the
claim.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
in
a
sense,
akin
to
the
position
asserted
by
justice
harlan
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
sniadach
case.
that
i
suggest
is
implicit
in
that,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
party
that
has
caused
the
goods
to
be
seized
in
the
first
instance.
the
party
has
to
come
into
court
and
prove
at
that
time
that
there
is
a
claim,
that
there
is
a
default,
that
there’s
a
valid
vendor’s
lien
or
some
other
basis
for
having
taken
the
property
from
the
possession
of
the
vendee.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
i
think
that
louisiana
state
rice
milling
case
cited
in
our
brief
is
to
that
effect
and
that
case
states
that
the
mere
coincidence
that
a
fact
is
relevant
both
on
the
writ
of
sequestration
and
on
the
merits
does
not
preclude
use
of
that
fact
on
the
hearing
to
dissolve
the
writ.
we
would
submit
that
if
such
a
showing
were
made
and
in
fact
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases
in
which
a
party
has
come
into
court
with
a
meritorious
defense
and
had
the
opportunity
even
before
there
need
be
a
final
determination
on
the
merits
to
have
that
defense
heard.
now,
that
didn’t
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
your
honor,
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
given
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
posture
of
the
case
before
this
court
that
it
makes
no
sense
for
the
court
to
order
a
new
hearing,
a
new
hearing
as
to
the
temporary
depravation
of
the
petitioner’s
property,
that
hearing
has
already
been
held.
now,
i’d
like
if
i
could
return
to
the
second
area
of
relevant
inquiry
here
and
that
is
as
to
the
role
of
the
judge
who
issues
the
writ
of
sequestration
in
the
first
instance.
we
contend
that
in
this
case
there
was
a
prior
judicial
determination
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
taking
of
the
petitioner’s
property
before
that
property
was
taken.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no,
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
so
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
prior
judicial
determination
was
ex
parte
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
louisiana
ex
parte
prior
judicial
determination
satisfies
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
--
the
rule
that’s
set
forth
in
the
fuentes
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
there
was
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
there
was
not
an
adversarial
hearing,
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
this
is
the
burden
that
falls
on
him
at
the
time
of
the
purchaser's
motion
to
dissolve
the
writ.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
oh,
yes
sir
it
was.
that
was
a
hearing
brought
on
by
the
petitioner
at
which
both
sides
were
present
and
there
was
argument
before
the
court.
i
might
say
your
honor,
in
regard
to
the
record
in
this
case
and
we
have
that
question
as
to
the
nature
of
the
stipulation
and
the
extent
of
the
stipulation
as
to
the
vendor’s
lien
in
this
case.
the
record
in
this
case
is
a
very
meager
one
and
though
i
here
argue
this
morning
as
to
the
role
of
the
court
on
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
writ
and
the
role
of
the
judge
as
of
the
time
that
the
writ
is
issued
in
the
first
instance,
there
has
not
been
in
the
record
in
this
case,
decisions
below
of
the
louisiana
court,
illuminating
exactly
what
the
functions
of
the
courts
are
under
both
those
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
recognize
that
problem
and
appear
that
that
so
your
honor.
we
have
endeavored
to
make
diligent
inquiry
into
the
louisiana
law
and
we
have
done
our
best
to
breakout
the
cases,
but
i
do
have
some
hesitancy
in
that
regard.
coming
back
to
the
argument
as
to
the
prior
ex
parte
judicial
determination
as
to
the
issuance
of
the
writ,
we
submit
in
this
case,
there
is
a
significant
difference
in
louisiana
from
the
situation
both
in
florida
and
in
pennsylvania
as
came
off
in
those
circumstances
as
the
fuentes
case.
now,
in
louisiana,
we
submit
that
there
is
effective
control
by
the
state
of
the
use
of
its
power
and
that
there
is
an
official
and
impartial
government
official
in
this
case,
a
reviewing
judge
who
must
consider
the
grounds
that
are
presented
in
the
application
for
the
writ
and
that
the
court
is
inquire
--
entitled
to
inquire
into
those
grounds
and
satisfy
itself
that
there
is
a
proper
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
and
that
there
is
a
probable
validity
to
the
claim
being
asserted
by
the
party
commencing
the
lawsuit,
seeking
the
taking
of
the
property.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well,
your
honor,
this
is
a
certain
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
there’s
some
question
in
my
mind
as
to
the
answer
to
that
question
because
i
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
sir,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
court
has
the
opportunity
to
make
the
inquiry
into
the
claim
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
--
and
the
party
seeking
the
issuance
of
the
writ
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
you
can’t
tell
from
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir.
there
was
a
ex
parte
hearing,
the
application
was
made
to
the
court
and
under
the
louisiana
decisions
that
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief,
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
court
to
undertake
an
evaluation
of
the
claim
and
look
into
these
facts
that
are
alleged
in
the
petition
to
make
a
determination
that
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
issuing
of
the
writ.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
and
that
the
property
is
in
the
possession
of
the
vendee,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
think
it
is
but
i’m
not
entirely
clear
on
that
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
i
do
have
some
trouble
in
reading
precisely
what
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir
and
i
appreciate
that
some
of
the
problems
in
the
civil
law
and
in
fact,
justice
holmes
has
addressed
himself
to
the
question
of
dealing
with
problems
under
the
civil
law
and
he
said,
“when
we
contemplate
such
a
system
from
the
outside,
it
seems
like
a
wall
of
stone,
every
part
even
with
all
the
others
except
so
far
as
our
own
local
education
may
lead
us
to
see
subordinations
to
which
we
are
accustomed.”
but
to
one
brought
up
within
it,
varying
emphasis,
tacit
assumptions,
unwritten
practices,
a
thousand
influences
gained
only
from
life
may
give
rise
to
the
different
parts,
wholly
new
values
that
logic
and
grammar
could
never
have
gotten
from
the
books
and
i
submit
that,
that
quotation
maybe
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
this
case
held
that
on
the
facts,
the
case
fell
within
the
exception
to
the
rule
in
the
fuentes
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
i
submit
there
is
an
ultimate
ground
in
the
decision.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir
it
did.
but
i
submit
there
is
an
alternate
ground
of
decision
in
this
case
which
would
be
appropriate
to
consider
in
the
court
and
this
is
set
forth
on
page
29
of
the
appendix.
and
the
court
stated
that
it
was
--
that
this
case
fell
within
the
exception
to
a
rule
announced
in
the
fuentes
case
that
there
maybe
cases
in
which
a
creditor
could
make
a
showing
of
immediate
danger
that
a
debtor
will
destroy
or
conceal
disputed
good.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
the
answer
to
that
question
your
honor
is
the
un-contradicted
allegations
made
in
the
petition
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
the
respondent
had
reason
to
fear
that
the
petitioner
would
alienate
or
dispose
of
the
property.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
submit
that
this
--
in
this
case,
it
was
a
fact,
it
was
a
sworn
statement
that
was
never
contested.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
completely
inappropriate
that
the
--
that
there
must
be
a
stronger
showing
that
merely
pro
forma
showing.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
and
the
suggestion
here
is
that
this
is
pro
forma
of
showing.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
in
that
regard,
i
suggest
that
in
part
that
maybe
attributable
to
that
fact
that
this
case
arose
before
the
fuentes
case
was
decided
and
before
the
parties
and
indeed
the
country
knew
what
was
required
for
a
showing
that
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
sir?
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir
it
did.
your
honor,
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
clear
is
that,
we
believe
we
have
cited
the
cases
appropriately
for
the
proposition
that
with
respect
to
the
threshold
inquiry
as
to
the
issuance
of
the
writ
of
sequestration
at
the
ex
parte
hearing,
there
is
considerable
authority
vested
in
the
court
and
the
judge
to
make
inquiry
as
to
the
claim
that’s
being
asserted,
and
to
test
that
claim.
we
have
seen
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
endeavor
to
distinguish
the
cases
on
the
basis
that
there
is
a
difference
between
judicial
sequestration
and
these
cases
only
apply
to
judicial
sequestration
and
some
other
cases.
the
claim
is
that
in
cases
involving
judicial
sequestration,
there
is
discretion
in
cases
involving
ordinary
garden
variety
sequestration,
there
is
no
discretion.
we
submit
that
attention
to
prior
law
under
which
these
cases
was
decided
indicates
that
there
is
one
kind
of
sequestration
and
that
is
the
judicial
sequestration.
we
have
set
forth
the
definition
of
sequestration
on
page
30
of
our
brief
and
that
shows
that
sequestration
applies
to
a
mandate
of
the
court,
to
the
sheriff
to
take
property
without
regard
whether
it’s
made
at
the
request
of
one
of
the
parties
or
both
of
the
parties,
so,
those
cases
we
submit
are
applicable.
one
further
point
that
i
think
deserve
to
be
made
in
the
context
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
unusual
feature
of
the
civil
law.
here,
the
vendor’s
lien
as
in
louisiana
supreme
court
has
set
forth
in
its
opinion
is
thought
to
be
an
important
creditor’s
right.
at
the
same
time,
it’s
a
right
that
can
easily
be
defeated
by
the
debtor
in
the
event
that
the
debtor
transfers
the
property,
the
vendor
losses
the
rights
as
against
the
property
and
so
that
it
was
for
this
reason
that
louisiana
supreme
court,
i
believe,
took
the
position
that
this
was
an
important
right
that
needed
to
be
safeguarded
and
that
there
were
circumstances
in
which
it
could
be
shown
that
there
was
an
immediate
need
for
action
on
the
part
of
the
creditor
and
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
government
to
lend
its
power
to
the
taking
of
that
action.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
what
page
is
that?
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
i
do.
but
we
submit
that
in
view
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
case
as
a
risk
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
initial
determinations
and
initial
proceedings
took
place
prior
to
the
time
that
the
fuentes
decision
was
rendered.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
hearing
in
this
case
in
which
it’s
been
determined
that
in
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
has
not
been
a
mistaken
or
unjustified
or
wrongful
taking
of
the
property
of
the
petitioner.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
either
to
vacate
the
writ
as
having
been
improvidently
granted
or
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
if
there
are
any
further
questions
of
the
court,
i’d
be
happy
entertain
them,
if
not
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir,
no.
far
from
it
we
would
be
contending
that
the
louisiana
supreme
--
the
louisiana
law
and
the
facts
that
this
case
as
well
as
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
decision
are
sufficiently
different
from
the
fuentes
case
as
to
not
require
its
application
to
the
present
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
that
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
oh,
your
honor
that
is
an
application
for
a
rehearing
that
was
made
by
the
petitioner
below
after
the
decision
had
been
rendered
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
the
decision
was
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
by
mitchell.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
for
rehearing
and
the
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
--
and
the
request
for
rehearing
was
denied.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well,
your
honor,
i
thought
about
that
and
i
feel
disturbed
as
my
brother
hobbs
does
about
the
fact
that
there
have
been
so
many
other
jurisdictions
and
courts
that
have
passed
upon
them
and
have
acted
upon
the
decision
in
the
fuentes
case
and
concluded
that
it
was
an
appropriate
rule
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
it
applied
and
adopted
it.
i
would
be
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
detected
some
lack
of
enthusiasm
in
some
of
the
decisions
including,
i
might
add
the
decisions,
the
many
decisions
that
have
recently
been
coming
down
in
regard
to
self-help
in
which
the
courts
have
seen
to
be
reluctant
to
extend
the
rule
in
the
fuentes
case
to
the
self-help
situation
admittedly
on
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
your
honor,
i’m
not
aware
of
any
states
in
which
there
has
been
legislation
of
yet.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
5
--
9-503,
yes
sir
and
just
recent
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
the
great
number
of
the
decisions
involving
an
application
of
that
section
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
have
held
that
action
under
that
section
was
not
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
that
it
didn’t
constitute
state
action,
and
just
recently
the
--
both
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit
have
come
down
on
the
side
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
on
the
side
of
self-help
as
being
not
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
the
uniform
commercial
code?
i
can’t
answer
that
question
your
honor,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
in
which
though
the
petitioner
claims
the
denial
of
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
regarding
the
taking
of
his
property
there
has
in
fact
already
been
a
hearing
in
that
regard.
the
petitioner
has
been
heard
and
his
contentions
have
been
decided
adversely
to
him.
one
point
i
might
make
right
off
the
bat,
your
honor,
is
that
this
case
arose
prior
to
the
time
that
the
decision
had
been
rendered
in
the
fuentes
case
and
the
trial
court's
determination
was
made
at
a
time
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
fuentes
case.
in
terms
of
the
arguments
in
the
briefs,
i
submit
that
there
are
two
basic
areas
of
dispute
between
the
parties
with
respect
to
louisiana
law.
the
first
of
those
areas
is
as
to
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
hearing
which
has
been
had
in
this
case.
in
the
second
area
of
dispute
is
with
respect
to
the
rule
of
the
court
which
issues
the
writ
of
sequestration.
now,
in
the
argument
that’s
preceded,
there
has
been
no
discussion
of
that
rule
and
i
think
that
there
should
be
a
fuller
development.
but
first,
i’d
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
hearing
that
has
been
had
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
comes
before
this
court
and
is
not
in
a
position
to
assert
an
injury.
the
fuentes
case
was
designed
to
prevent
mistaken,
unjustified
or
wrongful
deprivations
of
property
and
that
has
not
happened
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
has
had
a
hearing
albeit
after
the
property
was
taken
from
his
possession
and
he’s
been
heard
in
that
regard.
now,
as
to
the
nature
of
that
hearing,
this
was
a
hearing
that
was
brought
on
by
the
petitioner
to
set
aside
the
writ
of
sequestration
in
an
endeavor
to
obtain
the
return
of
the
property.
now,
the
petitioner
in
essence
claims
that
he
was
not
able
to
go
into
the
merits
of
the
case
at
that
time,
but
in
fact,
the
petitioner
was
able
to
cause
the
court,
the
louisiana
court
to
explore
into
the
grounds
for
the
issuance
of
what’s
referred
to
as
the
auxiliary
remedy.
there
is
a
comment
that
the
petitioner
has
referred
to
in
his
brief
to
the
effect
that
at
that
hearing
the
merits
may
not
be
inquired
into.
in
fact,
we
submit
that
any
significant
defense
can
be
raised
at
that
hearing
and
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
22
through
25
amply
demonstrate
that
in
cases
in
which
a
motion
has
been
brought
on
to
dissolve
a
writ
of
sequestration,
the
court
has
inquired
into
issues
that
go
to
the
merits
and
that
is
because
the
burden
of
proof
at
such
a
hearing
has
been
placed
on
the
party
that
caused
the
goods
to
be
seized
in
the
first
instance.
in
short,
the
burden
was
on
the
respondent
at
that
hearing
to
demonstrate
that
the
property
was
properly
seized.
now,
in
addition
at
that
hearing,
after
the
property
had
been
taken,
there
was
a
stipulation
entered
into
by
the
parties
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
valid
vendor’s
lien
on
the
property.
now,
in
short,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
petitioner
purchased
property
and
then
having
gone
into
default
after
the
property
was
seized,
came
into
the
court
and
admitted
that
there
was
a
valid
vendor’s
lien
on
that
property.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
that’s
so.
in
the
event
that
there
was
not
a
balance
due,
there
would
be
no
such
vendor’s
lien.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
your
honor,
i
think
that
that’s
so
but
beyond
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well
your
honor,
the
allegations
in
the
petition,
in
the
initial
affidavit
pursuant
to
which
this
action
was
commenced
were
to
the
effect
that
the
balance
was
unpaid
and
was
due
and
that
has
never
been
contested
nor
contradicted
and
it
could’ve
been
contested
and
contradicted.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir,
but
there
has
--
i
submit,
there
has
been
a
finding
to
that
effect
implicit
in
the
decision
of
the
court
at
the
hearing
to
set
aside
the
writ
of
sequestration.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
that’s
true.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no,
i
think
that
it
goes
to
something
more
than
that
because
it’s
an
admission
that
it
has
not
been
extinguished,
that
its
still,
that
it
has
not
been
extinguished,
that
it’s
still
in
existence
as
of
the
time
that
the
case
has
come
on
for
a
hearing
before
the
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
think
that
it
goes
beyond
that.
i
think
that
it
implicitly
meets
that
there
aren’t
defenses
of
such
in
nature
as
would
extinguish
that
vendor’s
lien.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir.
i
would
think
that
that
would
not
be
so.
i
think
that
we
have
cited
case
law
in
our
brief
to
that
effect
that
for
example
with
discharge
or
with
innovation
or
with
--
in
the
past
giving
of
notes,
a
vendor’s
lien
might
be
extinguished.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir
we
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
exactly
so
sir.
now
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
that
is
a
correct
statement.
i
think
that
my
brother’s
argument
goes
a
little
bit
further.
i
think
that
he
takes
the
position
that
there
was
not
a
final
determination
on
the
merits
as
to
the
ultimate
right
of
possession
of
the
property.
with
that
argument,
i’m
in
agreement.
there
was
no
such
final
determination.
the
property
so
to
speak
is
still
in
limbo.
there
has
not
been
a
final
judgment
in
this
case
but
i
would
submit
that
the
fuentes
case
does
not
require
an
initial
threshold
preliminary
ultimate
determination
of
the
right
to
the
possession
of
property.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
in
essence,
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
at
that
hearing
there
is
an
inquiry
into
the
probable
validity
of
the
claim.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
in
a
sense,
akin
to
the
position
asserted
by
justice
harlan
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
sniadach
case.
that
i
suggest
is
implicit
in
that,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
party
that
has
caused
the
goods
to
be
seized
in
the
first
instance.
the
party
has
to
come
into
court
and
prove
at
that
time
that
there
is
a
claim,
that
there
is
a
default,
that
there’s
a
valid
vendor’s
lien
or
some
other
basis
for
having
taken
the
property
from
the
possession
of
the
vendee.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
i
think
that
louisiana
state
rice
milling
case
cited
in
our
brief
is
to
that
effect
and
that
case
states
that
the
mere
coincidence
that
a
fact
is
relevant
both
on
the
writ
of
sequestration
and
on
the
merits
does
not
preclude
use
of
that
fact
on
the
hearing
to
dissolve
the
writ.
we
would
submit
that
if
such
a
showing
were
made
and
in
fact
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases
in
which
a
party
has
come
into
court
with
a
meritorious
defense
and
had
the
opportunity
even
before
there
need
be
a
final
determination
on
the
merits
to
have
that
defense
heard.
now,
that
didn’t
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
your
honor,
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
given
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
posture
of
the
case
before
this
court
that
it
makes
no
sense
for
the
court
to
order
a
new
hearing,
a
new
hearing
as
to
the
temporary
depravation
of
the
petitioner’s
property,
that
hearing
has
already
been
held.
now,
i’d
like
if
i
could
return
to
the
second
area
of
relevant
inquiry
here
and
that
is
as
to
the
role
of
the
judge
who
issues
the
writ
of
sequestration
in
the
first
instance.
we
contend
that
in
this
case
there
was
a
prior
judicial
determination
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
taking
of
the
petitioner’s
property
before
that
property
was
taken.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no,
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
so
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
prior
judicial
determination
was
ex
parte
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
louisiana
ex
parte
prior
judicial
determination
satisfies
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
--
the
rule
that’s
set
forth
in
the
fuentes
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
there
was
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
there
was
not
an
adversarial
hearing,
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
this
is
the
burden
that
falls
on
him
at
the
time
of
the
purchaser's
motion
to
dissolve
the
writ.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
oh,
yes
sir
it
was.
that
was
a
hearing
brought
on
by
the
petitioner
at
which
both
sides
were
present
and
there
was
argument
before
the
court.
i
might
say
your
honor,
in
regard
to
the
record
in
this
case
and
we
have
that
question
as
to
the
nature
of
the
stipulation
and
the
extent
of
the
stipulation
as
to
the
vendor’s
lien
in
this
case.
the
record
in
this
case
is
a
very
meager
one
and
though
i
here
argue
this
morning
as
to
the
role
of
the
court
on
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
writ
and
the
role
of
the
judge
as
of
the
time
that
the
writ
is
issued
in
the
first
instance,
there
has
not
been
in
the
record
in
this
case,
decisions
below
of
the
louisiana
court,
illuminating
exactly
what
the
functions
of
the
courts
are
under
both
those
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
recognize
that
problem
and
appear
that
that
so
your
honor.
we
have
endeavored
to
make
diligent
inquiry
into
the
louisiana
law
and
we
have
done
our
best
to
breakout
the
cases,
but
i
do
have
some
hesitancy
in
that
regard.
coming
back
to
the
argument
as
to
the
prior
ex
parte
judicial
determination
as
to
the
issuance
of
the
writ,
we
submit
in
this
case,
there
is
a
significant
difference
in
louisiana
from
the
situation
both
in
florida
and
in
pennsylvania
as
came
off
in
those
circumstances
as
the
fuentes
case.
now,
in
louisiana,
we
submit
that
there
is
effective
control
by
the
state
of
the
use
of
its
power
and
that
there
is
an
official
and
impartial
government
official
in
this
case,
a
reviewing
judge
who
must
consider
the
grounds
that
are
presented
in
the
application
for
the
writ
and
that
the
court
is
inquire
--
entitled
to
inquire
into
those
grounds
and
satisfy
itself
that
there
is
a
proper
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
and
that
there
is
a
probable
validity
to
the
claim
being
asserted
by
the
party
commencing
the
lawsuit,
seeking
the
taking
of
the
property.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well,
your
honor,
this
is
a
certain
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
there’s
some
question
in
my
mind
as
to
the
answer
to
that
question
because
i
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
sir,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
court
has
the
opportunity
to
make
the
inquiry
into
the
claim
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
--
and
the
party
seeking
the
issuance
of
the
writ
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
you
can’t
tell
from
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir.
there
was
a
ex
parte
hearing,
the
application
was
made
to
the
court
and
under
the
louisiana
decisions
that
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief,
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
court
to
undertake
an
evaluation
of
the
claim
and
look
into
these
facts
that
are
alleged
in
the
petition
to
make
a
determination
that
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
issuing
of
the
writ.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
and
that
the
property
is
in
the
possession
of
the
vendee,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
think
it
is
but
i’m
not
entirely
clear
on
that
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
i
do
have
some
trouble
in
reading
precisely
what
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir
and
i
appreciate
that
some
of
the
problems
in
the
civil
law
and
in
fact,
justice
holmes
has
addressed
himself
to
the
question
of
dealing
with
problems
under
the
civil
law
and
he
said,
“when
we
contemplate
such
a
system
from
the
outside,
it
seems
like
a
wall
of
stone,
every
part
even
with
all
the
others
except
so
far
as
our
own
local
education
may
lead
us
to
see
subordinations
to
which
we
are
accustomed.”
but
to
one
brought
up
within
it,
varying
emphasis,
tacit
assumptions,
unwritten
practices,
a
thousand
influences
gained
only
from
life
may
give
rise
to
the
different
parts,
wholly
new
values
that
logic
and
grammar
could
never
have
gotten
from
the
books
and
i
submit
that,
that
quotation
maybe
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
this
case
held
that
on
the
facts,
the
case
fell
within
the
exception
to
the
rule
in
the
fuentes
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
i
submit
there
is
an
ultimate
ground
in
the
decision.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir
it
did.
but
i
submit
there
is
an
alternate
ground
of
decision
in
this
case
which
would
be
appropriate
to
consider
in
the
court
and
this
is
set
forth
on
page
29
of
the
appendix.
and
the
court
stated
that
it
was
--
that
this
case
fell
within
the
exception
to
a
rule
announced
in
the
fuentes
case
that
there
maybe
cases
in
which
a
creditor
could
make
a
showing
of
immediate
danger
that
a
debtor
will
destroy
or
conceal
disputed
good.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
the
answer
to
that
question
your
honor
is
the
un-contradicted
allegations
made
in
the
petition
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
the
respondent
had
reason
to
fear
that
the
petitioner
would
alienate
or
dispose
of
the
property.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
submit
that
this
--
in
this
case,
it
was
a
fact,
it
was
a
sworn
statement
that
was
never
contested.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
completely
inappropriate
that
the
--
that
there
must
be
a
stronger
showing
that
merely
pro
forma
showing.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
and
the
suggestion
here
is
that
this
is
pro
forma
of
showing.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
in
that
regard,
i
suggest
that
in
part
that
maybe
attributable
to
that
fact
that
this
case
arose
before
the
fuentes
case
was
decided
and
before
the
parties
and
indeed
the
country
knew
what
was
required
for
a
showing
that
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
sir?
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir
it
did.
your
honor,
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
clear
is
that,
we
believe
we
have
cited
the
cases
appropriately
for
the
proposition
that
with
respect
to
the
threshold
inquiry
as
to
the
issuance
of
the
writ
of
sequestration
at
the
ex
parte
hearing,
there
is
considerable
authority
vested
in
the
court
and
the
judge
to
make
inquiry
as
to
the
claim
that’s
being
asserted,
and
to
test
that
claim.
we
have
seen
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
endeavor
to
distinguish
the
cases
on
the
basis
that
there
is
a
difference
between
judicial
sequestration
and
these
cases
only
apply
to
judicial
sequestration
and
some
other
cases.
the
claim
is
that
in
cases
involving
judicial
sequestration,
there
is
discretion
in
cases
involving
ordinary
garden
variety
sequestration,
there
is
no
discretion.
we
submit
that
attention
to
prior
law
under
which
these
cases
was
decided
indicates
that
there
is
one
kind
of
sequestration
and
that
is
the
judicial
sequestration.
we
have
set
forth
the
definition
of
sequestration
on
page
30
of
our
brief
and
that
shows
that
sequestration
applies
to
a
mandate
of
the
court,
to
the
sheriff
to
take
property
without
regard
whether
it’s
made
at
the
request
of
one
of
the
parties
or
both
of
the
parties,
so,
those
cases
we
submit
are
applicable.
one
further
point
that
i
think
deserve
to
be
made
in
the
context
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
unusual
feature
of
the
civil
law.
here,
the
vendor’s
lien
as
in
louisiana
supreme
court
has
set
forth
in
its
opinion
is
thought
to
be
an
important
creditor’s
right.
at
the
same
time,
it’s
a
right
that
can
easily
be
defeated
by
the
debtor
in
the
event
that
the
debtor
transfers
the
property,
the
vendor
losses
the
rights
as
against
the
property
and
so
that
it
was
for
this
reason
that
louisiana
supreme
court,
i
believe,
took
the
position
that
this
was
an
important
right
that
needed
to
be
safeguarded
and
that
there
were
circumstances
in
which
it
could
be
shown
that
there
was
an
immediate
need
for
action
on
the
part
of
the
creditor
and
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
government
to
lend
its
power
to
the
taking
of
that
action.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
your
honor,
what
page
is
that?
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
i
do.
but
we
submit
that
in
view
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
case
as
a
risk
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
initial
determinations
and
initial
proceedings
took
place
prior
to
the
time
that
the
fuentes
decision
was
rendered.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
hearing
in
this
case
in
which
it’s
been
determined
that
in
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
has
not
been
a
mistaken
or
unjustified
or
wrongful
taking
of
the
property
of
the
petitioner.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
either
to
vacate
the
writ
as
having
been
improvidently
granted
or
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
if
there
are
any
further
questions
of
the
court,
i’d
be
happy
entertain
them,
if
not
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir,
no.
far
from
it
we
would
be
contending
that
the
louisiana
supreme
--
the
louisiana
law
and
the
facts
that
this
case
as
well
as
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
decision
are
sufficiently
different
from
the
fuentes
case
as
to
not
require
its
application
to
the
present
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
that
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
oh,
your
honor
that
is
an
application
for
a
rehearing
that
was
made
by
the
petitioner
below
after
the
decision
had
been
rendered
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
the
decision
was
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
by
mitchell.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
for
rehearing
and
the
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
--
and
the
request
for
rehearing
was
denied.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
well,
your
honor,
i
thought
about
that
and
i
feel
disturbed
as
my
brother
hobbs
does
about
the
fact
that
there
have
been
so
many
other
jurisdictions
and
courts
that
have
passed
upon
them
and
have
acted
upon
the
decision
in
the
fuentes
case
and
concluded
that
it
was
an
appropriate
rule
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
it
applied
and
adopted
it.
i
would
be
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
detected
some
lack
of
enthusiasm
in
some
of
the
decisions
including,
i
might
add
the
decisions,
the
many
decisions
that
have
recently
been
coming
down
in
regard
to
self-help
in
which
the
courts
have
seen
to
be
reluctant
to
extend
the
rule
in
the
fuentes
case
to
the
self-help
situation
admittedly
on
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
your
honor,
i’m
not
aware
of
any
states
in
which
there
has
been
legislation
of
yet.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
5
--
9-503,
yes
sir
and
just
recent
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
the
great
number
of
the
decisions
involving
an
application
of
that
section
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
have
held
that
action
under
that
section
was
not
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
that
it
didn’t
constitute
state
action,
and
just
recently
the
--
both
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit
have
come
down
on
the
side
--
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
on
the
side
of
self-help
as
being
not
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
j.
o'sullivan
the
uniform
commercial
code?
i
can’t
answer
that
question
your
honor,
i
don’t
know.
