and
what
else?
justice
thurgood

but
experience
that
some
of
us
had
with
a
computer,
if
all
computer
had
made
a
mistake,
that’s
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
louisiana
law
is
that
it
or
not.
it’s
that
enough
to
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
have
taken
the
burden
of
showing
us
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
that
this
was
a
fully
valid
complete
ex
parte
hearing,
you’ve
taken
on
that,
now,
you
say
you
don’t
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
won’t
take
which
one
you
want
to
stand
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
it?
did
the
court
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
then
you
can’t
say
there
was
a
full
hearing.
the
use
--
the
most
you
can
say,
am
i
correct
is
that
there
was
an
opportunity
for
an
ex
parte
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
two
facts
are
one
that
there’s
a
lien
in
two
it
was
three-fold,
that’s
all
there
is,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
all
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
answer
me,
clearance
in
reading,
louisiana
law,
the
supreme
court’s
opinions,
i
think
you
should
go
on
down
and
look
at
it
because
it’s
the
civil
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
have
taken
the
burden
of
showing
that
you’ve
got
a
full
and
fair
hearing
and
you
now
say
you
don’t
know
what
it
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
is
justice
stewart’s
--
in
your
appendix
c,
supreme
court
of
louisiana
is
the
affidavit
which
uses
the
language
that
he
might
run
away
with
materials
and
it
appears
that
it’s
a
form
just
filled
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
appendix
c
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
which
is
on
file
here
in
this
court.
it
said
the
petition
of
deputy
grant,
all
of
it
was
filled
in
except
that
part,
that’s
not
filled
in.
so,
do
you
agree
that
was
just
a
fall?
