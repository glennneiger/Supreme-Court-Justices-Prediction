mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
upholding
the
louisiana
statutory
procedure
of
sequestration.
the
issue
presented
by
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
by
the
arguments
of
respondent
is
whether
the
decision
of
this
court
in
fuentes
v.
shevin
should
be
applied
to
the
louisiana
procedure
of
sequestration.
a
procedure
without
any
constitutionally
significant
references
from
the
procedures
and
of
florida
and
pennsylvania,
a
statutory
replevin
found
unconstitutional
in
fuentes
v.
shevin.
mitchell
is
not
asking
this
court
for
a
novel
holding.
the
key
facts
in
this
case
are
brief.
on
february
2,
1972,
grant
filed
a
money
claim
in
the
first
city
court
in
new
orleans.
that
claim
alleged
$574.00
to
--
against
the
purchase
price
of
four
appliances.
in
conjunction
with
that
money
claim,
grant
requested
that
a
seizure
by
writ
of
sequestration
be
authorized.
in
support
of
that
request
for
seizure
by
sequestration,
grant
filed
a
short
affidavit
which
verified
the
petition
and
a
surety
bond.
the
judge
authorized
the
seizure.
the
seizure
could
take
place
immediately.
as
was
true
in
fuentes,
the
writ
of
sequestration
issued
upon
the
minimal
showing
the
verified
petition
and
affidavit.
as
was
true
in
fuentes,
it
issued
only
by
the
--
with
the
filing
of
a
surety
bond.
as
was
true
in
fuentes,
the
issuance
of
the
writ
of
sequestration
is
a
ministerial
act.
it
is
the
mandatory
duty
of
the
issuing
official
to
issue
the
writ
of
sequestration
if
the
documents
presented
to
him
are
proper
on
their
face.
the
document
need
only
show
on
its
face,
a
claim,
in
this
case
the
$574.00
money
claim
alleged
to
be
due
on
four
appliance
purchased
11
to
19
months
prior
to
the
initiation
of
the
suit.
document
need
only
show
an
interest
of
the
claimant
and
the
property
to
be
seized,
in
this
case,
and
unrecorded
statutory
lien
was
asserted
and
third,
the
document
need
only
show
the
defendant’s
power
over
the
property
to
be
seized,
in
this
case,
delivery
of
the
goods
to
mitchell
was
alleged.
the
procedure
is
broadly
available
to
every
plaintiff
who
is
willing
to
make
these
averments.
once
the
writ
of
sequestration
is
authorized,
the
seizure
may
take
place
immediately.
as
in
fuentes,
there
are
only
post-seizure
procedures
available
to
the
dispossessed
parties.
as
in
fuentes,
those
procedures
came
too
late,
the
depravation
has
already
occurred.
however,
to
put
this
case
in
the
proper
perspective,
i’ll
briefly
go
through
the
post
seizure
procedures
which
mitchell
pursued.
the
dispossessed
party
may
defend
both
against
the
money
claim
and
against
the
seizure,
in
this
case,
mitchell
sought
to
dissolve
the
seizure
first.
mitchell
alleged
state
grounds,
state
exemptions
statute,
he
argued
applied
it
to
certain
of
the
appliances.
mitchell
also
asserted
at
the
due
process
clauses
of
louisiana
and
the
united
states
constitutions
protected
him
against
this
seizure.
a
hearing
was
held,
both
parties
appeared.
no
testimony
was
introduced.
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no,
he
can
--
he
could
do
this
in
his
defense
to
the
underlying
petition
for
setting
a
money
claim
and
that
is
his
intent,
what
he
intents
to
do
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
by
pleadings
and
been
at
the
trial
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
he
can
--
the
louisiana
law
is
actually
unclear
on
this.
it
does
say
he
can
attach
and
attack
any
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
suggest
that’s
not
the
law
of
louisiana,
what
the
law
says
and
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
well,
respondent
does
make
the
argument
out
of
the
--
he
makes
the
argument
that
because
mitchell
could
have
raised
defenses
in
that
post-seizure
hearing
that
he
had
to
raise
every
defense
and
because
he
did
not
raise
the
seizures
against
the
underlying
claim,
he
only
raised
defenses
against
the
seizure
that
he
has
waived
all
these
defenses.
i
--
it
makes
a
difference
if
you
reach
that
conclusion.
however,
as
to
my
constitutional
argue
--
argument,
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
because
it
comes
too
late,
it
comes
after
the
depravation.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
after
the
city
court
refused
to
dissolve
the
seizure,
mitchell
sought
immediate
interlocutory
relief
at
the
appellate
level
and
intermediate
appellate
court
refused
to
review.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
granted
review
on
interlocutory
writs
of
review
certiorari
and
mandamus,
etcetera
and
after
hearing
briefs
and
oral
arguments
of
the
parties,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
louisiana
procedure
of
sequestration.
to
uphold
the
decision
below
would
be
in
effect
to
overrule
fuentes
v.
shevin.
however,
the
decision
in
fuentes
is
not
the
only
principle
involved
to
uphold
the
decision
below
would
be
to
depart
from
a
sound
constitutional
principles
applied,
and
a
host
of
this
--
of
other
decisions
of
this
court
stretching
over
a
period
of
more
than
100
years.
that
principle
is
the
very
fundamental
principle
that
the
state
cannot
seize
a
person’s
property
without
prior
notice
and
hearing
except
in
the
most
extra
ordinary
of
situations.
to
uphold
the
decision
below
would
be
to
carve
a
new
and
almost
unlimited
exception
to
that
principle.
to
uphold
the
decision
below
would
also
cast
out
an
uncertainty
upon
the
decisions
of
more
than
60
courts
in
more
than
29
states
which
have
struck
down
statutes
similar
to
those
involved
in
fuentes
in
reliance
upon
this
court’s
decision
in
fuentes
v.
shevin
and
sniadach
v.
family
finance.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
to
protect
the
individual
against
the
state.
the
key
stand
to
this
constitutional
protection
is
the
right
to
defend
one’s
property
prior
to
a
state
seizure.
this
can
be
accomplished
effectively
only
by
affording
the
individual
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
prior
to
the
state
seizure.
this
right
to
prior
notice
and
hearing
can
be
abridged
only
by
the
most
overriding
of
state
interest.
the
broadly
available
procedure
of
statutory
sequestration
abridges
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
individual
without
any
overriding
state
justification
for
that
abridgment.
but
they
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
it’s
a
--
there’s
been
more
than
60
decisions
in
more
than
29
states.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
nine.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
there
has
been
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i’m
aware
of
the
legislatures
considering
new
legislation
to
give
consumers
prior
notice
and
hearing.
i
believe
that
a
few
states
have
--
had
sufficient
time
to
enact
such
legislature,
legislation.
if
it
would
aid
the
court,
i
could
prepare
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
that
point.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no,
to
--
when
i
was
writing
it
i
thought
it
would
--
it
was
--
would
do
--
to
state
the
obvious.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
and
including
those
60
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no,
those
decisions
are
all
since
sniadach
and
since
fuentes.
sniadach
was
decided
in
1969.
the
cases
that
were
based
on
sniadach
and
pre
fuentes,
i
suppose,
would
be
--
have
been
predicting
this
court’s
decision
in
fuentes
v.
shevin.
the
basis
on
which
the
louisiana
supreme
court
distinguished
fuentes
are
not
entirely
clear.
however,
none
of
those
justifications,
evidenced
this
the
--
the
type
of
state
interest
necessary
to
overcome
the
constitutional
protection
of
prior
notice
and
hearing.
the
louisiana
supreme
courts
made
it
--
an
opinion
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
seizure
by
sequestration
is
available
to
every
louisiana
credit
seller
who
believes
that
there
has
been
a
default
in
a
credit
transaction.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
refused
to
confine
the
application
of
the
sequestration
statutes
to
narrow
extraordinary
situations.
the
need
for
prompt
action
identified
by
the
louisiana
court
is
the
ordinary
desire
which
any
anxious
creditor
might
feel
well
enforcing
his
claim.
the
procedure
of
sequestration
is
not
confined
to
situations
where
a
creditor
can
show
the
collateral
is
actually
endangered.
the
creditor
need
only
show
that
the
owner
has
power
over
that
property.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
we
then
have
the
problem
of
safeguards
to
ensure
whether
that
determination
to
safeguard
that
the
determination
is
accurate
once
it
is
made.
the
usual
safeguard
is
the
adversary
process
and
that’s
why
we
say
prior
hearings.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
well,
if
we
presume
that
consumers
do
spare
things
away
or
sitting
in
their
house
with
the
hatchet
ready
to
destroy
the
goods;
that
would
raise
our
presumption
to
a
constitutional
presumption
of
malice
of
consumers.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
that
is
a
presumption
which
i’m
unwilling
to
indulge
in.
however,
i
think
if
there
were
adequate
safeguards
to
determine
the
probability
of
consumer
destruction
that
then
perhaps
we
would
have
a
statute
which
would
be
narrowly
drawn
and
come
within
the
exceptions
of
fuentes,
however
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
well
the
traditional
safeguard
is
adversarial
hearing
in
which
both
sides
can
assert
their
interests.
perhaps,
we
could
--
there
are
other
traditional
safe
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
it
doesn’t,
i’m
talking
about
a
hearing
prior.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
and
those
are
the
safeguards
to
protect
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
--
to
make
sure
that
the
state
is
not
engaging
in
an
erroneous
decision
when
it
decides
there's
a
need
to
seize
this
property
to
take
it
from
one
individual
and
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
as
a
safeguard
for
the
state
to
ensure
that
the
state.
to
ensure
that
the
state
is
not
engaging
in
mistaken
deprivations
and
a
safeguard
for
the
debtor
to
insure
that
he
is
not
deprived
of
his
property
through
mistake
or
inadvertence
or
otherwise.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no,
there's
no
contest.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
there
is
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
the
court
in
fuentes
suggested
that
at
that
hearing
that
the
underlying
merits
of
the
claim
would
be
what
the
claimant
must
prove
in
order
to
obtain
the
seizure.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
when
you
get
in
to
probable
cause
which
is
getting
into
us
a
burden
or
the
specific
facts
on
which
this
--
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
creditor
must
show.
if
we
have
the
adversarial
context,
i
suppose
we
could
go
in
the
traditional
manner
where
he
states
his
claim,
he
tries
to
prove
his
claim
and
the
defendant
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
has
to
reach
that
question
to
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
think
that
perhaps
one
of
the
issues
that
could
be
involved
is
the
necessity
of
the
seizure
and
if
it
is
not
shown
necessary
at
that
hearing,
that
is
that
there
is
no
danger
of
the
goods
to
the
goods
to
be
seized,
but
then
there
would
be
no
reason
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
if
you
indulge
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
that
is
the
ordinary
way
that
we
test
the
claims
under
our
system.
i
think
it
is
a
good
system.
i
would
be
reluctant
to
see
this
court
abandon
that
system,
but
i
do
believe
state
legislatures
could
come
up
with
possibly
new
techniques.
i
think
i
would
have
to
examine
those
new
safeguards
to
protect
the
state
and
the
defendant
once
they
were
drawn
to
--
before
i
could
defend
them.
i
mean,
possibly,
we
could
have
a
judicial
investigation.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
the
--
well,
let
me
make
this
clear.
the
self-help
repossession
as
is
known
under
the
ucc
is
not
a
part
of
the
law
of
louisiana.
it
presents
different
questions
than
are
presented
by
the
statute.
i
do
not
think
that
court
should
reach
that
decision.
that
question
in
this
case,
the
court
does
not
have
to,
it
presents
difficult
questions
of
state
action
and
a
number
of
the
courts
had
been
splitting
on
this
issue.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
not
in
the
context
of
the
credit
sale
and
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
there
are
no
conditional
sales,
title
vests
in
buyer
immediately
upon
the
agreement
of
the
price
and
the
goods
and
therefore
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
subject
to
the
vendor’s
lien,
and
therefore,
under
that
rational,
they
do
not
allow
self-help
repossession.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no
it
doesn’t,
it
will
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
one
made
out
of
the
state,
but
it
will
not
enforce
one
made
within
the
state.
if
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
finding
is
read
to
mean
that
the
creditor’s
interest
in
the
property
is
superior
to
the
debtor’s
right
to
be
--
to
have
his
property
secure
from
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
seizure,
it
is
erroneous.
there
are
no
safeguards
prior
to
the
seizure
except
those
say
--
those
minimal
showings
that
were
present
in
fuentes.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
rules
that
none
of
those
safeguards
were
necessary
because
it
gave
an
unbridled
preference
to
the
interest
of
one
litigant
that
was
a
security
interest
which
without
even
considering
the
full
legal
title
of
mitchell
or
his
right
to
be
secure
from
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
state
seizures.
such
a
use
of
state
power
without
proper
safeguards
is
unconstitutional.
mitchell
requests
that
this
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
reverse
the
unconstitutional
seizure
of
his
property.
to
do
so
would
be
entirely
consistent
with
this
court’s
prior
decisions.
to
do
so
would
be
to
vindicate
the
decisions
of
more
than
60
lower
courts
in
more
29
states
which
have
relied
upon
this
court’s
decisions
in
fuentes
v.
shevin,
sniadach
v.
family
finance
and
a
host
of
other
decisions
of
this
court.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes,
i
have
a
few.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
the
law
of
louisiana
is
not
clear
as
to
what
is
relevant
at
that
post-seizure
hearing.
this
was
my
position,
one
that
i
had
two
good
grounds
to
dissolve
that
sequestration,
the
constitutional
claim
and
an
exemption
statute
and
--
but
what
the
louisiana
courts
do
say?
what
--
in
louisiana
code
of
civil
procedure,
article
3506
covers
the
dissolution
of
the
writ
of
sequestration.
(voice
overlap)
see
to
that
article
states
this
article
retains
the
jurisprudential
rule
that
only
the
grounds
for
auxiliary
--
for
the
auxiliary
remedy
can
be
inquired
into
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
and
significantly
and
not
the
merits
of
the
main
demand.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
certainly,
if
the
statute
had
been
declared
unconstitutional,
i
would
have
gotten
the
property
back.
if
the
exemption
statute
had
been
found
applicable
to
this
procedure,
i
would’ve
gotten
the
property
back.
in
fact,
the
court,
this
--
louisiana
supreme
court
divided
on
the
exemption
issue,
they
did
not
divide
on
the
constitutional
issue.
i
would
like
to
point
out
mr.
rehnquist
directed
a
question
to
mr.
o’sullivan
regarding
on
geographical
preference.
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
i’ve
been
in
boston
for
a
year.
i
didn’t
realize
i
lost
my
louisiana
accent
so
much
but
my
entire
practice
of
law
prior
to
that
was
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
was
in
the
case
initially
and
i
left
louisiana
before
it
was
argued
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court
but
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
was
in
at
the
outset.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
the
--
i
think
the
practice
is
that
the
--
is
that
a
petition
which
i
characterize
and
i
think
fairly
so
as
a
pro
forma,
that
is
a
--
it’s
a
legal
form
that’s
used
over
and
over
again,
is
presented
to
the
judge.
he
is
then
by
the
statute
3501
of
the
civil
code
of
procedure
to
the
face
of
that
document
because
the
document
is
pro
forma,
because
it
is
used
over
and
over
again,
it
does
not
tell
him
anything,
it
is
not
like
an
affidavit
for
a
tr
or
under
the
federal
rules
of
several
procedure
or
under
the
louisiana’s
rule
to
obtain
an
injunction,
that
requires
a
detailed
specific
facts
on
an
affidavit.
perhaps,
if
we
had
such
safeguards
as
is
embodied
in
the
federal
rules
for
injunction,
maybe
then
we
could
say,
we
will
allow
deprivations
without
the
adversarial
context,
but
those
safeguards
would
have
to
be
exempt
in
a
case
in
which
they
were
used
because
they
are
not
the
traditional
methods
of
safeguarding
one
person’s
interest
against
the
claim
of
another.
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
do
not
think
that
the
issue
should
finally
--
be
finally
resolved
if
we
have
a
very
short
mini
hearing.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes
sir
or
yes,
i
do.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient.
i’m
not
saying
that
you
have
to
reach
what
kind
of
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes,
i’m
willing
to
concede
any
standard
at
this
point
and
that
prior
hearing
if
you’ll
give
me
the
prior
hearing.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
but
i
would
like
to
examine
the
statutes.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
if
that
affidavit
was
presented
in
the
adversarial
context,
that
is
where
one
party
presents
his
side
of
the
case.
well,
we’re
dealing
with
the
affidavit
on
what
is
--
judge’s
acts
--
acting
on
one
side
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
would
suggest,
if
we
had
a
requirement
in
louisiana
that
there
was
a
detailed
showing
of
all
that
the
creditor
knows
and
the
judge
was
given
the
discretion
as
a
judge
and
the
federal
court
has
given
the
discretion
in
issuing
a
tro
that
we
would
have
a
very
different
situation
and
it
should
be
closely
examined
and
determined
whether
those
safeguards
are
accurate,
but
this
is
not
the
case.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no.
what
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
would
also
in
conjunction
with
the
request
on
what
is
relevant
at
that
post-seizure
hearing,
there
is
one
case
in
which
a
judge
had
a
post-seizure
hearing
did
enter
a
judgment
on
the
merits
against
the
dispossessed
party,
that
case
was
reversed,
it
was
held
that
that
was
not
to
be
determined
at
that
motion
to
dissolve
and
i
cite
that
in
my
reply
brief,
it's
tucker
versus
shawna
(ph)
case.
the
question
though
is
what
standards
apply
to
the
judge
at
the
time
he
is
presented
with
these
documents
and
requested
to
issue
the
sequestration.
the
louisiana
courts
making
clear
that
mandamus
will
lie
to
compel
him
to
issue
the
writ
of
sequestration
if
the
documents
on
their
face
are
proper.
he
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
go
beyond
the
face
of
those
documents
or
even
to
question
what
they
say
on
their
face.
in
this
case,
there
is
simply
no
requirement
of
a
detailed
showing.
i
think
for
these,
unless
there
is
any
further
questions,
that’s
my
case.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
upholding
the
louisiana
statutory
procedure
of
sequestration.
the
issue
presented
by
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
by
the
arguments
of
respondent
is
whether
the
decision
of
this
court
in
fuentes
v.
shevin
should
be
applied
to
the
louisiana
procedure
of
sequestration.
a
procedure
without
any
constitutionally
significant
references
from
the
procedures
and
of
florida
and
pennsylvania,
a
statutory
replevin
found
unconstitutional
in
fuentes
v.
shevin.
mitchell
is
not
asking
this
court
for
a
novel
holding.
the
key
facts
in
this
case
are
brief.
on
february
2,
1972,
grant
filed
a
money
claim
in
the
first
city
court
in
new
orleans.
that
claim
alleged
$574.00
to
--
against
the
purchase
price
of
four
appliances.
in
conjunction
with
that
money
claim,
grant
requested
that
a
seizure
by
writ
of
sequestration
be
authorized.
in
support
of
that
request
for
seizure
by
sequestration,
grant
filed
a
short
affidavit
which
verified
the
petition
and
a
surety
bond.
the
judge
authorized
the
seizure.
the
seizure
could
take
place
immediately.
as
was
true
in
fuentes,
the
writ
of
sequestration
issued
upon
the
minimal
showing
the
verified
petition
and
affidavit.
as
was
true
in
fuentes,
it
issued
only
by
the
--
with
the
filing
of
a
surety
bond.
as
was
true
in
fuentes,
the
issuance
of
the
writ
of
sequestration
is
a
ministerial
act.
it
is
the
mandatory
duty
of
the
issuing
official
to
issue
the
writ
of
sequestration
if
the
documents
presented
to
him
are
proper
on
their
face.
the
document
need
only
show
on
its
face,
a
claim,
in
this
case
the
$574.00
money
claim
alleged
to
be
due
on
four
appliance
purchased
11
to
19
months
prior
to
the
initiation
of
the
suit.
document
need
only
show
an
interest
of
the
claimant
and
the
property
to
be
seized,
in
this
case,
and
unrecorded
statutory
lien
was
asserted
and
third,
the
document
need
only
show
the
defendant’s
power
over
the
property
to
be
seized,
in
this
case,
delivery
of
the
goods
to
mitchell
was
alleged.
the
procedure
is
broadly
available
to
every
plaintiff
who
is
willing
to
make
these
averments.
once
the
writ
of
sequestration
is
authorized,
the
seizure
may
take
place
immediately.
as
in
fuentes,
there
are
only
post-seizure
procedures
available
to
the
dispossessed
parties.
as
in
fuentes,
those
procedures
came
too
late,
the
depravation
has
already
occurred.
however,
to
put
this
case
in
the
proper
perspective,
i’ll
briefly
go
through
the
post
seizure
procedures
which
mitchell
pursued.
the
dispossessed
party
may
defend
both
against
the
money
claim
and
against
the
seizure,
in
this
case,
mitchell
sought
to
dissolve
the
seizure
first.
mitchell
alleged
state
grounds,
state
exemptions
statute,
he
argued
applied
it
to
certain
of
the
appliances.
mitchell
also
asserted
at
the
due
process
clauses
of
louisiana
and
the
united
states
constitutions
protected
him
against
this
seizure.
a
hearing
was
held,
both
parties
appeared.
no
testimony
was
introduced.
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no,
he
can
--
he
could
do
this
in
his
defense
to
the
underlying
petition
for
setting
a
money
claim
and
that
is
his
intent,
what
he
intents
to
do
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
by
pleadings
and
been
at
the
trial
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
he
can
--
the
louisiana
law
is
actually
unclear
on
this.
it
does
say
he
can
attach
and
attack
any
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
suggest
that’s
not
the
law
of
louisiana,
what
the
law
says
and
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
well,
respondent
does
make
the
argument
out
of
the
--
he
makes
the
argument
that
because
mitchell
could
have
raised
defenses
in
that
post-seizure
hearing
that
he
had
to
raise
every
defense
and
because
he
did
not
raise
the
seizures
against
the
underlying
claim,
he
only
raised
defenses
against
the
seizure
that
he
has
waived
all
these
defenses.
i
--
it
makes
a
difference
if
you
reach
that
conclusion.
however,
as
to
my
constitutional
argue
--
argument,
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
because
it
comes
too
late,
it
comes
after
the
depravation.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
after
the
city
court
refused
to
dissolve
the
seizure,
mitchell
sought
immediate
interlocutory
relief
at
the
appellate
level
and
intermediate
appellate
court
refused
to
review.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
granted
review
on
interlocutory
writs
of
review
certiorari
and
mandamus,
etcetera
and
after
hearing
briefs
and
oral
arguments
of
the
parties,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
louisiana
procedure
of
sequestration.
to
uphold
the
decision
below
would
be
in
effect
to
overrule
fuentes
v.
shevin.
however,
the
decision
in
fuentes
is
not
the
only
principle
involved
to
uphold
the
decision
below
would
be
to
depart
from
a
sound
constitutional
principles
applied,
and
a
host
of
this
--
of
other
decisions
of
this
court
stretching
over
a
period
of
more
than
100
years.
that
principle
is
the
very
fundamental
principle
that
the
state
cannot
seize
a
person’s
property
without
prior
notice
and
hearing
except
in
the
most
extra
ordinary
of
situations.
to
uphold
the
decision
below
would
be
to
carve
a
new
and
almost
unlimited
exception
to
that
principle.
to
uphold
the
decision
below
would
also
cast
out
an
uncertainty
upon
the
decisions
of
more
than
60
courts
in
more
than
29
states
which
have
struck
down
statutes
similar
to
those
involved
in
fuentes
in
reliance
upon
this
court’s
decision
in
fuentes
v.
shevin
and
sniadach
v.
family
finance.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
to
protect
the
individual
against
the
state.
the
key
stand
to
this
constitutional
protection
is
the
right
to
defend
one’s
property
prior
to
a
state
seizure.
this
can
be
accomplished
effectively
only
by
affording
the
individual
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
prior
to
the
state
seizure.
this
right
to
prior
notice
and
hearing
can
be
abridged
only
by
the
most
overriding
of
state
interest.
the
broadly
available
procedure
of
statutory
sequestration
abridges
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
individual
without
any
overriding
state
justification
for
that
abridgment.
but
they
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
it’s
a
--
there’s
been
more
than
60
decisions
in
more
than
29
states.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
nine.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
there
has
been
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i’m
aware
of
the
legislatures
considering
new
legislation
to
give
consumers
prior
notice
and
hearing.
i
believe
that
a
few
states
have
--
had
sufficient
time
to
enact
such
legislature,
legislation.
if
it
would
aid
the
court,
i
could
prepare
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
that
point.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no,
to
--
when
i
was
writing
it
i
thought
it
would
--
it
was
--
would
do
--
to
state
the
obvious.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
and
including
those
60
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no,
those
decisions
are
all
since
sniadach
and
since
fuentes.
sniadach
was
decided
in
1969.
the
cases
that
were
based
on
sniadach
and
pre
fuentes,
i
suppose,
would
be
--
have
been
predicting
this
court’s
decision
in
fuentes
v.
shevin.
the
basis
on
which
the
louisiana
supreme
court
distinguished
fuentes
are
not
entirely
clear.
however,
none
of
those
justifications,
evidenced
this
the
--
the
type
of
state
interest
necessary
to
overcome
the
constitutional
protection
of
prior
notice
and
hearing.
the
louisiana
supreme
courts
made
it
--
an
opinion
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
seizure
by
sequestration
is
available
to
every
louisiana
credit
seller
who
believes
that
there
has
been
a
default
in
a
credit
transaction.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
refused
to
confine
the
application
of
the
sequestration
statutes
to
narrow
extraordinary
situations.
the
need
for
prompt
action
identified
by
the
louisiana
court
is
the
ordinary
desire
which
any
anxious
creditor
might
feel
well
enforcing
his
claim.
the
procedure
of
sequestration
is
not
confined
to
situations
where
a
creditor
can
show
the
collateral
is
actually
endangered.
the
creditor
need
only
show
that
the
owner
has
power
over
that
property.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
we
then
have
the
problem
of
safeguards
to
ensure
whether
that
determination
to
safeguard
that
the
determination
is
accurate
once
it
is
made.
the
usual
safeguard
is
the
adversary
process
and
that’s
why
we
say
prior
hearings.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
well,
if
we
presume
that
consumers
do
spare
things
away
or
sitting
in
their
house
with
the
hatchet
ready
to
destroy
the
goods;
that
would
raise
our
presumption
to
a
constitutional
presumption
of
malice
of
consumers.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
that
is
a
presumption
which
i’m
unwilling
to
indulge
in.
however,
i
think
if
there
were
adequate
safeguards
to
determine
the
probability
of
consumer
destruction
that
then
perhaps
we
would
have
a
statute
which
would
be
narrowly
drawn
and
come
within
the
exceptions
of
fuentes,
however
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
well
the
traditional
safeguard
is
adversarial
hearing
in
which
both
sides
can
assert
their
interests.
perhaps,
we
could
--
there
are
other
traditional
safe
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
it
doesn’t,
i’m
talking
about
a
hearing
prior.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
and
those
are
the
safeguards
to
protect
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
--
to
make
sure
that
the
state
is
not
engaging
in
an
erroneous
decision
when
it
decides
there's
a
need
to
seize
this
property
to
take
it
from
one
individual
and
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
as
a
safeguard
for
the
state
to
ensure
that
the
state.
to
ensure
that
the
state
is
not
engaging
in
mistaken
deprivations
and
a
safeguard
for
the
debtor
to
insure
that
he
is
not
deprived
of
his
property
through
mistake
or
inadvertence
or
otherwise.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no,
there's
no
contest.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
there
is
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
the
court
in
fuentes
suggested
that
at
that
hearing
that
the
underlying
merits
of
the
claim
would
be
what
the
claimant
must
prove
in
order
to
obtain
the
seizure.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
when
you
get
in
to
probable
cause
which
is
getting
into
us
a
burden
or
the
specific
facts
on
which
this
--
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
creditor
must
show.
if
we
have
the
adversarial
context,
i
suppose
we
could
go
in
the
traditional
manner
where
he
states
his
claim,
he
tries
to
prove
his
claim
and
the
defendant
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
has
to
reach
that
question
to
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
think
that
perhaps
one
of
the
issues
that
could
be
involved
is
the
necessity
of
the
seizure
and
if
it
is
not
shown
necessary
at
that
hearing,
that
is
that
there
is
no
danger
of
the
goods
to
the
goods
to
be
seized,
but
then
there
would
be
no
reason
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
if
you
indulge
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
that
is
the
ordinary
way
that
we
test
the
claims
under
our
system.
i
think
it
is
a
good
system.
i
would
be
reluctant
to
see
this
court
abandon
that
system,
but
i
do
believe
state
legislatures
could
come
up
with
possibly
new
techniques.
i
think
i
would
have
to
examine
those
new
safeguards
to
protect
the
state
and
the
defendant
once
they
were
drawn
to
--
before
i
could
defend
them.
i
mean,
possibly,
we
could
have
a
judicial
investigation.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
the
--
well,
let
me
make
this
clear.
the
self-help
repossession
as
is
known
under
the
ucc
is
not
a
part
of
the
law
of
louisiana.
it
presents
different
questions
than
are
presented
by
the
statute.
i
do
not
think
that
court
should
reach
that
decision.
that
question
in
this
case,
the
court
does
not
have
to,
it
presents
difficult
questions
of
state
action
and
a
number
of
the
courts
had
been
splitting
on
this
issue.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
not
in
the
context
of
the
credit
sale
and
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
there
are
no
conditional
sales,
title
vests
in
buyer
immediately
upon
the
agreement
of
the
price
and
the
goods
and
therefore
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
subject
to
the
vendor’s
lien,
and
therefore,
under
that
rational,
they
do
not
allow
self-help
repossession.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no
it
doesn’t,
it
will
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
one
made
out
of
the
state,
but
it
will
not
enforce
one
made
within
the
state.
if
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
finding
is
read
to
mean
that
the
creditor’s
interest
in
the
property
is
superior
to
the
debtor’s
right
to
be
--
to
have
his
property
secure
from
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
seizure,
it
is
erroneous.
there
are
no
safeguards
prior
to
the
seizure
except
those
say
--
those
minimal
showings
that
were
present
in
fuentes.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
rules
that
none
of
those
safeguards
were
necessary
because
it
gave
an
unbridled
preference
to
the
interest
of
one
litigant
that
was
a
security
interest
which
without
even
considering
the
full
legal
title
of
mitchell
or
his
right
to
be
secure
from
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
state
seizures.
such
a
use
of
state
power
without
proper
safeguards
is
unconstitutional.
mitchell
requests
that
this
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
reverse
the
unconstitutional
seizure
of
his
property.
to
do
so
would
be
entirely
consistent
with
this
court’s
prior
decisions.
to
do
so
would
be
to
vindicate
the
decisions
of
more
than
60
lower
courts
in
more
29
states
which
have
relied
upon
this
court’s
decisions
in
fuentes
v.
shevin,
sniadach
v.
family
finance
and
a
host
of
other
decisions
of
this
court.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes,
i
have
a
few.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
the
law
of
louisiana
is
not
clear
as
to
what
is
relevant
at
that
post-seizure
hearing.
this
was
my
position,
one
that
i
had
two
good
grounds
to
dissolve
that
sequestration,
the
constitutional
claim
and
an
exemption
statute
and
--
but
what
the
louisiana
courts
do
say?
what
--
in
louisiana
code
of
civil
procedure,
article
3506
covers
the
dissolution
of
the
writ
of
sequestration.
(voice
overlap)
see
to
that
article
states
this
article
retains
the
jurisprudential
rule
that
only
the
grounds
for
auxiliary
--
for
the
auxiliary
remedy
can
be
inquired
into
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
and
significantly
and
not
the
merits
of
the
main
demand.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
certainly,
if
the
statute
had
been
declared
unconstitutional,
i
would
have
gotten
the
property
back.
if
the
exemption
statute
had
been
found
applicable
to
this
procedure,
i
would’ve
gotten
the
property
back.
in
fact,
the
court,
this
--
louisiana
supreme
court
divided
on
the
exemption
issue,
they
did
not
divide
on
the
constitutional
issue.
i
would
like
to
point
out
mr.
rehnquist
directed
a
question
to
mr.
o’sullivan
regarding
on
geographical
preference.
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
i’ve
been
in
boston
for
a
year.
i
didn’t
realize
i
lost
my
louisiana
accent
so
much
but
my
entire
practice
of
law
prior
to
that
was
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
was
in
the
case
initially
and
i
left
louisiana
before
it
was
argued
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court
but
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
was
in
at
the
outset.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
the
--
i
think
the
practice
is
that
the
--
is
that
a
petition
which
i
characterize
and
i
think
fairly
so
as
a
pro
forma,
that
is
a
--
it’s
a
legal
form
that’s
used
over
and
over
again,
is
presented
to
the
judge.
he
is
then
by
the
statute
3501
of
the
civil
code
of
procedure
to
the
face
of
that
document
because
the
document
is
pro
forma,
because
it
is
used
over
and
over
again,
it
does
not
tell
him
anything,
it
is
not
like
an
affidavit
for
a
tr
or
under
the
federal
rules
of
several
procedure
or
under
the
louisiana’s
rule
to
obtain
an
injunction,
that
requires
a
detailed
specific
facts
on
an
affidavit.
perhaps,
if
we
had
such
safeguards
as
is
embodied
in
the
federal
rules
for
injunction,
maybe
then
we
could
say,
we
will
allow
deprivations
without
the
adversarial
context,
but
those
safeguards
would
have
to
be
exempt
in
a
case
in
which
they
were
used
because
they
are
not
the
traditional
methods
of
safeguarding
one
person’s
interest
against
the
claim
of
another.
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
do
not
think
that
the
issue
should
finally
--
be
finally
resolved
if
we
have
a
very
short
mini
hearing.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes
sir
or
yes,
i
do.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient.
i’m
not
saying
that
you
have
to
reach
what
kind
of
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
yes,
i’m
willing
to
concede
any
standard
at
this
point
and
that
prior
hearing
if
you’ll
give
me
the
prior
hearing.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
but
i
would
like
to
examine
the
statutes.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
if
that
affidavit
was
presented
in
the
adversarial
context,
that
is
where
one
party
presents
his
side
of
the
case.
well,
we’re
dealing
with
the
affidavit
on
what
is
--
judge’s
acts
--
acting
on
one
side
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
would
suggest,
if
we
had
a
requirement
in
louisiana
that
there
was
a
detailed
showing
of
all
that
the
creditor
knows
and
the
judge
was
given
the
discretion
as
a
judge
and
the
federal
court
has
given
the
discretion
in
issuing
a
tro
that
we
would
have
a
very
different
situation
and
it
should
be
closely
examined
and
determined
whether
those
safeguards
are
accurate,
but
this
is
not
the
case.
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
no.
what
--
mr.
robert
j.
hobbs
i
would
also
in
conjunction
with
the
request
on
what
is
relevant
at
that
post-seizure
hearing,
there
is
one
case
in
which
a
judge
had
a
post-seizure
hearing
did
enter
a
judgment
on
the
merits
against
the
dispossessed
party,
that
case
was
reversed,
it
was
held
that
that
was
not
to
be
determined
at
that
motion
to
dissolve
and
i
cite
that
in
my
reply
brief,
it's
tucker
versus
shawna
(ph)
case.
the
question
though
is
what
standards
apply
to
the
judge
at
the
time
he
is
presented
with
these
documents
and
requested
to
issue
the
sequestration.
the
louisiana
courts
making
clear
that
mandamus
will
lie
to
compel
him
to
issue
the
writ
of
sequestration
if
the
documents
on
their
face
are
proper.
he
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
go
beyond
the
face
of
those
documents
or
even
to
question
what
they
say
on
their
face.
in
this
case,
there
is
simply
no
requirement
of
a
detailed
showing.
i
think
for
these,
unless
there
is
any
further
questions,
that’s
my
case.
