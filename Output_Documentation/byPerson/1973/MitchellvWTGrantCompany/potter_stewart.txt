justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hobbs,
you
said
that,
i
missed
--
i
think
--
something
you
said,
the
courts
of
how
many
states
had
held
similar
laws
unconstitutional
beyond
understanding
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
more
than
29?
justice
potter
stewart
nine.
and
have
the
state
legislatures
done
anything
either
in
those
states
where
the
existing
law
was
declared
unconstitutional
or
another
states
where
the
courts
have
not
done
so
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
have
there
been
modifications
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
a
--
do
you
have
in
your
brief
the
judicial
decisions
to
which
you
referred
more
than
--
you
cite
this
--
citations
to?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
they’re
more
than
60
in
over
29
--
in
at
least
29
states?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
it
only
--
the
--
there’s
always
a
vendor’s
lien
in
--
under
louisiana
law,
when
personal
property,
when
a
chattel
is
sold
and
the
full
purchase
price
is
not
then
in
there
paid,
there’s
always
a
so
called
vendor's
privilege,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
all
the
submission
amounted
to,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
simply
be
an
admission
of
no
more
than
that
the
full
purchase
price
has
still
not
yet
been
paid,
isn’t
that
right
under
louisiana
law?
justice
potter
stewart
well
simply,
and
the
only
thing
that
would
extinguish
it
as
i
understand
it
at
least
under
louisiana
law
of
which
i’m
generally
very
ignorant,
is
that
until
the
full
purchase
price
has
been
paid
plus
whatever
interest
and
service
charges
there
maybe,
the
vendor’s
lien
remains
and
is
not
extinguished,
isn’t
that
correct?
the
vendor’s
privilege,
it's
called
in
louisiana.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
--
that’s
you
and
your
brother
are
not
in
agreement
as
to
that
factual
issue
or
as
to
that
question
of
louisiana
law?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that’s
true
of
course
and
--
then
the
fuentes
in
all
its
ramifications
was
fully
satisfied,
wasn’t
it,
this
case,
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
prior
determination
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
all
of
the
issues
that
had
to
do
with
who
should
have
relevant
possession
of
the
property
before
the
property
was
taken
then
i
should
suppose
that
fuentes
if
broadly
read
was
fully
satisfied,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
what
is
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don’t
say
there
was
prior
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
hearing
of
it
in
the
sense
of
any
kind
of
an
adversary
hearing
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
--
their
reasoning
was
as
i
understand
it
and
i’ve
just
reread
it
here
in
the
bench
was
that
the
vendee
purchased
the
property,
was
implied
in
law
knowledge
of
what
the
law
of
louisiana
was.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
what
they
said.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now,
what
if
anything
in
the
record
of
this
case
justified
the
statement
that
the
--
that
this
case
comes
within
that
language
of
fuentes.
there
maybe
cases
in
which
a
creditor
could
make
a
showing
of
immediate
danger
that
a
debtor
will
destroy
or
conceal
disputed
goods?
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that
part
of
the
form
used
in
every
single
one
of
this
in
louisiana?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
it
were
a
part
of
the
form
used
in
every
single
one
of
these
or
they
used
routinely
and
traditionally
in
every
single
one
of
these
in
louisiana,
would
you
say
that
was
--
had
came
within
the
exception?
exception
and
a
part
of
the
rule,
doesn’t
it
in
louisiana?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
there
anything
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
came
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
after
fuentes
obviously
because
they
dealt
with
fuentes.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
time
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
fuentes
had
been
decided
quite
clearly.
justice
potter
stewart
were
you
in
in
this
case
from
the
beginning?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
were
in
at
the
--?
justice
potter
stewart
outset.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
case
of
mitchell
against
w.t.
grant
company.
in
my
view
this
case
is
constitutionally
indistinguishable
from
the
case
of
fuentes
against
shevin,
decided
by
this
court
only
two
years
ago
and
reported
in
volume
407
of
the
united
states
reports,
and
the
court
today
has
simply
rejected
the
reasoning
of
that
case
and
adopted
instead
the
analysis
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
written
by
my
brother
mr.
justice
white.
on
the
reasoning
and
authority
of
the
fuentes
opinion,
i
would
reverse
the
judgment
before
us
because
the
louisiana
sequestration
procedure
fails
to
comport
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
of
law.
these
views
are
spelled
out
in
some
detailed
in
the
written
opinion,
i
have
filed
today,
but
i
would
add
an
additional
word.
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
we
respect
the
constitutional
decisions
of
this
court,
we
can
hardly
expect
that
others
will
do
so.
a
substantial
departure
from
precedent
can
only
be
justified,
i
have
thought,
in
the
light
of
experience
with
the
application
of
the
rule
to
be
abandoned
or
in
the
light
of
an
altered
historic
environment.
yet
the
court
today
has
unmistakably
overruled
a
considered
decision
of
this
court
that
is
barely
two
years
old
without
pointing
to
any
change
in
basic
constitutional
understandings
that
might
justify
this
total
disregard
of
stare
decisis.
the
fuentes
decision
was
in
a
direct
line
of
recent
cases
in
this
court
that
have
applied
the
procedural
due
process
commands
of
the
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
prohibit
governmental
action
that
deprives
a
person
of
a
statutory
or
contractual
property
interest
with
no
advance
notice
and
no
opportunity
to
be
heard.
in
the
short
time
that
has
elapsed
since
the
fuentes
case
was
decided,
many
state
and
federal
courts
have
followed
it
in
accessing
the
constitutional
validity
of
state
replevin
statutes
and
other
comparable
state
laws.
no
data
have
been
brought
to
our
attention
to
indicate
that
these
decisions,
granting
to
otherwise
defenseless
consumers,
the
simple
rudiments
of
due
process
of
law
have
worked
any
untoward
change
in
the
consumer
credit
market
or
in
other
commercial
relationships.
the
only
perceivable
change
that
has
occurred
since
the
fuentes
case
is
in
the
make
up
of
this
court.
a
basic
change
in
the
law
upon
a
ground,
no
firmer
than
a
change
in
this
court’s
membership
invites
the
popular
misconception
that
this
institution
is
a
little
different
from
the
two
political
branches
of
government.
no
misconception
could
do
more
lasting
injury
to
this
court
and
to
the
system
of
law
which
it
is
our
abiding
mission
to
serve.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
marshal
have
joined
this
dissenting
opinion
and
that
mr.
justice
brennan
also
agrees
that
fuentes
versus
shevin
requires
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
