justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
make
any
assertion
that
there
was
not
a
balance
due
on
the
debt?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
at
the
trial
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
claim
that's
his
motion
to
dissolve
the
writ,
he
may
not
challenge
the
averments
that
balance
are
due?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
notice
that
respondent’s
claim
that
at
this
hearing,
he
dissolved
the
writ,
he
may
challenge
anything
that
is
relevant
to
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
that
it
was
the
law
of
louisiana.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
could
challenge
the
writ,
to
challenge
the
underlying
facts
on
which
the
writ
was
based.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
namely
that
there
is
a
debt
due.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
balance
due,
would
that
make
any
difference
to
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
still
comes
too
late.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
--
well,
i’ll
--
you
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
doesn’t
seem
to
be
any
question
about
--
why
under
a
louisiana
law,
the
seller
in
this
case
had
a
property
interest
in
the
goods?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
there
were
chattel
mortgage
on
that
or
some
--
something
besides
just
a
vendor's
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
both
parties
have
property
interest
in
the
goods
and
the
question
is
who
has
possession
pending
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let’s
assume
there
was
a
hearing
of
whatever
kind
of
a
hearing
that
you
think
would
be
satisfactory,
what
would
you
think
would
have
to
be
established
at
that
hearing
in
order
to
change
possession
or
is
your
position
that
possession
may
not
be
changed
until
the
entire
litigation
is
over?
would
you
say
that
at
the
hearing,
all
you
would
have
to
establish
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
a
balance
due
on
the
debt?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
you
have
to
try
out
the
entire
case
and
make
final
and
conclusive
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
probable
cause
to
believe?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
isn’t
that
--
so
you,
in
effect
--
you’re
saying
that
you
must
have
a
full
adversarial
hearing
on
all
of
the
issues
in
the
case
and
decide
them
on
the
merits
before
possession
maybe
changed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it’s
very
much
the
part
of
the
inquiry
is
what
kind
of
a
hearing
are
you
talking
about
as
requiring
before
a
change
of
possession?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
fill
that,
to
put
the
burden
on
the
creditor
for
that
and
to
show
that
--
how
does
he
show
that?
in
effect
you’re
just
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
effect
you’re
just
saying,
let’s
wait
till
the
trial
is
all
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
also
think
that
the
private
repossession
would
be
illegal
without
any
aid
from
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
self-help
remedies
under
the
louisiana
law
permissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
subject
to
the
vendor’s
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
means
there
is
a
--
you
have
a
lien,
you
have
to
--
there
has
to
be
balance
due
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
--
you
may
have
a
vendor’s
lien
but
not
have
the
right
to
possess
because
the
balance
may
not
be
due,
may
not
be
unpaid.
now
by
just
conceding
that
there's
a
balance
vendors
lien
it
doesn’t
concede
that
it's
unpaid?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
that
in
this
case.
was
there
any
concession,
ever
any
concession
that
was
un
--
that
the
balance
was
unpaid?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
never
been
admitted
--
never
been
admitted
either,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
is
--
i
take
it
that
the
--
at
this
--
here
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
your
seizure
was
proper?
that
meant
showing
not
only
a
vendor’s
lien
but
there
was
a
--
that
there
was
a
default?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
order
for
them
not
to
set
us
--
in
order
for
the
court
not
to
set
aside
the
writ
and
the
sequestration
and
collect
on
your
bond
that
there
was
any
damages.
in
order
for
the
court
to
refuse
to
do
that,
it
had
to
find,
you
argue
that
there
was
a
default?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
(voice

--
what
do
you
think
the
standard
is
under
louisiana
law
at
the
hearing
to
quash
the
seizure
such
as
what’s
held
in
this
case.
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
you
say
that
the
seizure
was
justified.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standard
does
the
court
apply,
probable
cause
or
it’s
sort
of
like
a
preliminary
hearing
you’ve
established
whether
there’s
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
claim?
justice
byron

is
that

you
don’t

that
we

in

is
that
provision
that

on

unconstitutional
under

in

in
these

justice

on

what

of
what
state

where

what
provision

justice

white
or
would
the

the
hearing
if
you
would
want
before
a

would
the

be

how
about

probable

do
you

put
an

to

first
that
you
can’t
just
decide
the
probable

on

basis
of

let’s
assume
you
had
an
opportunity
to
counter

and
then
argue,
you
want
to
be
before
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
on
the
probable
--
for
instance,
say
for
summary
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
is
relevant,
what
kind
of
a
hearing
you’re
talking
about
is
whether
you’re
entitled
to
it
or
you’re
talking
about
a
kind
of
hearing
on
the
merits
before
any
transfer
of
possession
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
be
one
thing.
if
you're
not,
there’s
something
else
maybe?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
another
case,
the
chief
justice
indicated,
mitchell
against
w.t.
grant
company,
number
72-6160.
this
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
the
question
is
whether
the
procedures
under
the
louisiana
statute
for
the
foreclosure
of
the
vendor’s
land
on
personal
property,
comports
on
with
due
process.
under
the
louisiana
law
a
repossession
is
permitted
without
prior
notice
and
without
a
prior
hearing
but
only
after
on
a
judicial
order
obtained
on
a
written
application
by
the
creditor
and
that
only
after
the
filing
of
the
sufficient
bond.
there
is
an
early
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
we
hold
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
and
do
not
agree
that
the
fuentes’
case,
a
recent
case
in
this
court
and
407
us
requires
the
invalidation
of
the
louisiana
statute.
the
louisiana
--
we
affirm
its
judgment.
justice
byron

white
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
and
mr.

powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.

well,
if
it
is
relevant,
what
kind
of
a
hearing
you’re
talking
about
is
whether
you’re
entitled
to
it
or
you’re
talking
about
a
kind
of
hearing
on
the
merits
before
any
transfer
of
possession
is
concerned?

it
might
be
one
thing.
if
you're
not,
there’s
something

justice

i
have
another
case,
the
chief
justice
indicated,
mitchell
against
w.t.
grant
company,
number
72-6160.
this
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
the
question
is
whether
the
procedures
under
the
louisiana
statute
for
the
foreclosure
of
the
vendor’s
land
on
personal
property,
comports
on
with
due
process.
under
the
louisiana
law
a
repossession
is
permitted
without
prior
notice
and
without
a
prior
hearing
but
only
after
on
a
judicial
order
obtained
on
a
written
application
by
the
creditor
and
that
only
after
the
filing
of
the
sufficient
bond.
there
is
an
early
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
we
hold
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
and
do
not
agree
that
the
fuentes’
case,
a
recent
case
in
this
court
and
407
us
requires
the
invalidation
of
the
louisiana
statute.
the
louisiana
--
we
affirm
its
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
and
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
