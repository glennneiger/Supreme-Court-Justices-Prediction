guess,
it
strikes
me
that
the
interesting
is
this
all
have
been,
probably
is
not
very
material
to
the
case
because
doesn’t
the
government
concede
that
this
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
in
this
argument,
doesn’t
the
government
concede
that
this
are
managerial
employees?

in,
well
north

no
went
up
and
then
back
and
then
up
again
and
finally
the
eighth
circuit
rejected
that
conflict
of
interest
as
the
second
time
it
went
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
this
led
to
another
embarrassing
thing
on
our
case
because
the
very
day
of
the
decision,
the
second
decision
in
north
arkansas
was
the
day
of
decision
of
the
board
in
our
case.
justice

in
nlrb
against
bell
aerospace,
we
have
a
labor
law
case
here
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
question
presented,
involved
the
appropriateness
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
a
collective
bargaining
unit
composed
of
buyers,
persons
responsible
for
the
purchasing
function
for
respondent
corporation.
following
an
election
and
certification
of
the
unit
by
the
board,
the
company
refused
to
bargain,
contending
that
the
buyers
were
managerial
employees
and
not
covered
by
the
act.
the
company
was
found
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
ordered
to
bargain.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
enforcement
on
two
grounds.
first
it
held
that
the
board
had
applied
an
erroneous
test
in
determining
whether
these
employees
were
covered
by
the
act
and
secondly,
in
view
of
the
board’s
previous
contrary
decisions,
the
court
held
that
the
board
must
proceed
by
rule
making
rather
than
adjudication
before
adopting
a
new
test.
the
central
issue
is
whether
managerial
employees
are
covered
by
the
act.
the
board
had
previously
indicated
that
they
are
not.
in
this
case
however,
the
board
applied
a
more
restrictive
test
of
whether
the
employee's
duties
would
create
a
conflict
of
interest
in
labor
relations.
we
hold,
as
they
did
the
second
circuit,
that
such
a
restrictive
test
is
not
compatible
with
the
act.
the
appropriate
question
is
whether
the
individual
is
a
managerial
employee
and
this
depends
not
upon
his
title,
but
upon
his
authority
and
duties.
we
do
not
agree,
however,
that
rule
making
is
required
on
this
issue
rather
than
a
case-by-case
adjudication.
accordingly,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
white

a
dissenting

in

mr.

brennan,
mr.

mr.
