mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
and
the
principal
question
involves
the
extent
to
which
certain
kinds
of
employees
whom
the
board
calls
managerial
employees
are
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now
managerial
employees,
is
a
board
concept,
it’s
not
a
statutory
definition
and
the
board
has
defined
these
employees
--
as
employees
who
are
in
a
position
to
formulate,
determine
and
effectuate
management
policies.
the
category
as
i
will
show
is
not
limited
to
top
management,
nor
is
it
limited
to
persons
who
carry
out
labor
relations
policy.
but
it
includes
a
wide
range
of
minor
administrative
or
executive
personnel
such
as
buyers,
expediters,
claims
adjusters,
and
so
forth.
the
present
case
involves
buyers
employed
by
a
company
which
manufactures
and
sells
rocket
engines
and
electronic
equipment.
now
it
is
the
board’s
position
that
managerial
employees,
assuming
that
they
are
not
otherwise
exempt
as
supervisors
are
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
thus
entitled
to
organizational
and
bargaining
rights
under
the
act
unless
their
duties
are
concerned
with
labor
relations
or
other
matters
which
are
likely
to
cause
a
conflict
between
their
job
responsibilities
and
their
responsibilities
to
a
labor
organization.
the
court
below
on
the
other
hand
held
that
all
managerial
employees
are
exempt
from
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
will
show
that
that
is
based
upon
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history
which
i’ll
get
to
in
a
moment.
the
case
arises
in
this
factual
setting,
local
1286
of
the
auto
workers
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
seeking
certification
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
25
buyers
employed
in
the
purchasing
and
procurement
department
of
the
company’s
wheatfield,
new
york
plant.
the
company
opposed
the
petition
on
the
ground
that
the
buyers
were
managerial
employees
and
thus
excluded
from
the
acts
coverage.
at
a
hearing
before
the
board,
the
following
facts
were
established.
the
purchasing
and
procurement
department
fills
orders
from
30
other
departments.
this
involves
purchasing,
maintenance
and
repair
items
such
as
fuel
oil
and
light
bulbs,
support
items
such
as
packaging
and
paper
and
production
items
ranging
from
simple
nuts
and
bolts
to
sophisticated
components
for
the
equipment
of
the
company
manufacturers
and
about
70%
of
the
company’s
business
consists
of
parts
for
the
minute
man
missile
project.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
said
that
70%
of
the
company’s
business
are
materials
for
the
minute
man
missile
project,
some
of
which
has
nuts
and
bolts.
many
of
the
purchases
are
off
the
shelf
items
which
can
be
obtained
from
a
number
of
sources.
other
items
must
be
made
up
according
to
the
companies’
specific
needs.
the
buyers
in
this
proceeding
work
under
a
procurement
director
--
an
assistant
procurement
director,
two
purchasing
agents
and
four
supervisors.
there
are
seven
or
eighth
supervisory
personnel
over
the
buyers.
the
buyers
need
not
have
a
college
education
nor
does
the
company
have
any
formal
training
program
for
them.
they
are
guided
in
their
work
by
a
procurement
manual
and
other
written
instructions.
their
salaries
range
from
a
$195.00
to
$275.00
a
week.
they
are
not
paid
for
casual
over
time
but
they
are
compensated
for
scheduled
over
time
that
has
been
authorized
by
a
supervisor.
purchase
orders
are
initiated
by
requisition
from
the
various
departments.
these
codes
of
procurement
department
whether
they
are
assigned
to
a
supervisor
who
in
turn
assigns
them
to
a
particular
buyer.
requisitions
for
items
which
have
been
ordered
previously
generally
specify
a
particular
vendor.
where
no
vendor
has
been
designated
under
requisition,
the
buyer
is
free
to
select
one.
when
obtaining
sophisticated
production
items,
purchasing
decision
are
made
by
a
team
of
supervisory
personnel
from
the
engineering
quality
assurance
finance
and
manufacturing
departments
and
the
buyer
“x”
is
the
team
chairman.
the
buyers
may
place
or
cancel
orders
of
less
than
$5,000.00
on
their
own
signature.
larger
orders
however
require
supervisory
approval
with
higher
levels
of
supervision
required
as
the
cost
rises.
indeed
an
order
is
over
$5,000.00
the
buyer
is
required
to
conduct
pre
negotiations
with
supervisory
personnel
and
the
procurement
department
before
he
can
even
contact
a
potential
vendor.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
and
others
in
the
record,
the
board
assumed
that
the
buyers
were
managerial
employees
as
the
company
contended.
however
following
its
decision
in
north
arkansas
electric
where
it
held
that
managerial
employees
were
covered
by
the
act
and
entitled
to
representation
or
rights
there
under
unless
they
or
concerned
with
labor
relations
or
other
matters
it
would
present
the
conflict
of
interest
that
i
alluded
to
earlier.
the
board
concluded
that
the
company’s
buyers
were
not
in
this
category
and
therefore
covered
by
the
act.
the
board
rejected
the
company’s
claim
that
the
buyer’s
authority
to
commit
the
company’s
credit
and
to
select
suppliers
created
a
potential
conflict
of
interest.
in
that
the
buyers
would
be
more
receptive
to
higher
bids
from
unionized
contractors,
the
board
found
that
the
purchasing
discretion
of
the
buyer
was
neither
quoting
from
the
board
presently
so
on
bridled
or
potentially
so
uncontrollable
as
to
create
the
possible
problems
of
which
the
employer
complains.
and
the
board
then
found
that
a
unit
of
buyers
alone
would
constitute
an
appropriate
unit
for
collective
bargaining
directed
in
election
in
the
unit
which
the
union
want
--
certify
the
union.
the
company
refused
to
bargain
in
order
to
test
the
certification
the
board
issued
a
bargaining
order.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
indicated
rejected
the
board’s
view
that
managerial
employees
are
covered
by
the
act
except
where
a
conflict
of
interest
is
presented
and
hailed
that
a
managerial
employee
is
not
only
an
employee
that
would
present
a
conflict
of
interest
problem
but
any
one
who
has
formulating,
determining
or
effectuating
his
employer’s
policies
or
as
discretion
independent
of
an
employer’s
established
policy
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
if
you
fell
into
that
category
you
are
a
managerial
employee
and
not
covered
by
the
act.
however,
the
court
added
that
the
board
would
not
be
precluded
from
determining
that
the
buyer
is
here
or
some
types
of
them
might
not
be
managerial
employees
as
it
define
the
term
in
a
remand
of
the
case
to
the
board
for
such
a
determination
but
directed
the
board
to
do
so
via
a
role
making
proceeding
under
section
four
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
now
we
do
not
think
that
we
reach
that
issue
although
we
are
prepared
to
if
the
board’s
definition
of
managerial
employee
is
upheld.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
is
your
honor
as
i
will
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
there
is
a
case
--
the
swift
case
which
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
may
have
to
reach
that
if
you
are
persuaded
that
the
swift
case
is
not
an
aberration
through
change
of
board.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
now
i
like
to
get
to
what
we
have
been
doing.
section
23
of
the
wagner
act
provided
that
the
term
employee
shall
include
any
employee
but
shall
not
include
any
individual
employed
as
an
agricultural
laborer
or
into
domestic
service
of
any
family
or
person
at
his
home
or
any
individual
employed
by
his
parent
or
his
spouse.
now
the
board
early
ruled
that
since
the
statutory
definition
was
of
wide
comprehension
and
only
had
these
three
exclusions
in
it.
it
covered
all
other
employees
including
managerial
employees
and
supervisory
employees,
thus
the
discharge
of
managerial
or
supervisory
employees
were
engaging
in
union
activity
would
violate
section
81
and
3
of
the
wagner
act.
the
board
however
excluded
managerial
and
supervisory
employees
from
bargaining
units
of
rank
and
file
employees
on
the
ground
that
their
duties
are
closely
related
to
management.
with
respect
to
supervisors
because
that’s
where
most
of
the
action
occurred
under
the
wagner
act,
the
board
vacillated
between
holding
that
not
only
were
supervisors
not
included
but
then
rank
and
file
units
but
for
a
time
it
held
that
it
wasn’t
even
appropriate
to
put
them
in
a
unit
confined
as
supervisors.
but
the
board
changed
that
policy
in
the
packard
case
and
found
that
a
unit
of
supervisors
was
appropriate
for
bargaining.
the
packard
case
came
to
this
court
in
1947
and
this
court
by
a
five
to
four
vote
sustained
the
board’s
position
that
foreman
were
protected
by
the
act
and
that
a
unit
limited
to
foreman
or
supervisors
was
appropriate
for
collective
bargaining.
now
in
1947,
congress
turned
around
and
overturned
the
packard
decision
by
specifically
excluding
any
individual
employed
as
a
supervisor
from
the
section
23
definition
of
employee
and
thus
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
legislative
evolution
of
this
exclusion
however
is
very
significant,
the
house
bill
defined
a
supervisor
as
including
not
only
those
individuals
with
power
to
higher
transfer,
promote
and
discharge
or
discipline
other
employees
but
also
personnel
who
fix
or
make
effective
recommendation
with
respect
to
wages
earned
by
other
employees,
labor
relations,
timestudy,
police
and
guard
personnel
and
confidential
employees.
this
would
have
excluded
from
coverage
not
only
the
traditional
supervisors
but
many
of
the
individuals
whom
the
board
had
treated
as
managerial
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
what’s
that
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
in
so
far
as
they
would
have
been
excludable
as
supervisor.
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
one
in
that
position
that
would
not
have
met
the
supervisory
definition.
now
that
senate
bill
defined
the
term
supervisor
more
narrowly.
limiting
it
to
individuals
having
authority
to
higher
transfer,
suspend
layoff
and
so
on
the
traditional
indicia
of
a
supervisor.
the
senate
report
and
the
senate
debates
showed
that
the
narrower
senate
definition
represented
a
rejection
of
the
views
of
those
who
instead
of
merely
wanting
to
over
turn
packard
and
excludes
supervisors
with
genuine
management
prerogatives
from
the
act
wanted
to
exclude
wider
categories
of
employees.
at
a
conference
committee
accepted
the
senate’s
definition
of
supervisor
and
with
regard
to
those
additional
employees
would
been
included
within
the
house
but
not
the
senate
definition.
the
conference
reports
stated,
in
the
case
of
persons
working
in
the
labor
relations,
personnel
and
employment
departments,
it
was
not
thought
necessary
to
make
specific
provision
as
was
done
in
the
house
bill
since
the
board
has
treated
and
will
continue
to
treat
such
persons
as
outside
the
scope
of
the
act.
this
is
the
prevailing
board
practice
with
respect
to
such
people
as
confidential
secretaries
as
well.
they
went
on
to
say
that
they
were
not
excluding
timestudy
people
or
guards
nor
did
they
exclude
professional
employees.
now
the
house
conference
report,
in
so
far
as
it
stated
that
the
board
was
excluding
persons
working
in
the
labor
relations
personnel
and
employment
departments.
from
the
coverage
of
the
act,
it
was
mistaken
and
that
the
only
thing
that
the
board
had
done
with
respect
to
those
people
as
it
had
done
with
respect
to
supervisors
was
to
hold
that
they
were
not
appropriately
included
in
units
of
rank
and
file
or
office
or
in
clerical
employees
but
giving
that
conference
report,
the
benefit
of
what
of
the
misapprehension
that
the
conferees
were
under.
the
most
that
it
shows
was
an
intent
to
exclude
from
the
coverage
of
the
act
labor
relations
personnel
and
employees
in
the
employment
departments
and
confidential
employees.
the
buyers
here
and
most
other
of
the
managerial
employees
not
concerned
with
labor
relations
policy
certainly
do
not
fit
within
that
category.
now
the
reason
for
excluding
persons
in
the
labor
relations
and
employment
departments
from
coverage
is
that
people
with
those
duties
are
in
a
position
where
their
duties
could
bring
them
into
a
conflict
of
interest
situation
if
you
were
to
accord
them
unionization
rights.
the
board’s
test
of
what
managerial
employees
are
and
are
not
covered
by
the
act
we
submit
gives
effect
to
this
congressional
intention
that
those
types
of
employees
should
be
excluded
from
coverage.
whereas
on
the
other
hand,
the
broader
definition
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
what
exclude
from
coverage
not
only
managerial
employees
who
are
concerned
with
labor
relations
policies
but
any
other
employee
who
is
concerned
with
effectuating
the
employers
policies
would
exclude
from
coverage
thousands
of
employees
who
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
exclude.
it
would
exclude
many
employees
that
certainly
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
the
frontline
of
management
which
was
what
congress
was
careful
to
confine
itself
to
in
restricting
the
definition
of
supervisor
and
it
would
exclude
many
who
certainly
are
not
as
well
trained
as
professional
employees
whom
congress
did
not
exclude
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
only
provision
that
was
made
with
respect
to
professional
employees
was
to
say
that
before
you
can
group
them
with
in
a
unit
with
non
professionals,
you
have
to
give
them
a
self
determination
election.
now
what
are
the
reasons
which
lead
the
court
of
appeals
to
what
we
regard
as
a
misreading
of
the
congressional
intention?
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
unless
they
adopted
the
expansive
interpretation
of
managerial
employees
and
i
have
just
alluded
to.
you
would
not
be
giving
full
effect
to
this
court’s
decision
in
the
--
that
is
the
dissent
in
this
core
--
in
the
packard
case
which
to
be
sure
was
very,
very
responsible
for
the
exclusion
of
supervisors
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
now
in
packard
however,
the
dissent
as
we
read
it
was
concerned
with
putting
in
the
employer
category
all
those
who
acted
for
management,
not
only
in
formulating
but
in
also
executing
its
labor
policies.
the
boards’
conflict
of
interest
test
excludes
from
the
coverage
of
the
act
managerial
employees
who
are
so
involved
with
labor
policies.
now
the
court
below
also
said,
and
this
gets
back
i
believe
that
the
question
that
you
have
asked
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
if
you
would
interpret,
unless
you
interpret
managerial
employees
as
broadly
as
the
court
below
did,
it
could
lead
to
the
organization
of
vice
presidents
and
other
top
executives
which
was
prophesied
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
packard.
we
submit
that
the
board’s
test
does
not
do
that
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place
as
i
mentioned
before,
most
such
executives
are
likely
to
be
excluded
from
the
act
as
supervisors
and
those
who
do
not
meet
the
supervisory
definition.
what
probably
present
a
conflict
of
interest
situation
and
thus
would
be
the
type
of
managerial
employee
which
the
boards
test
would
exclude
from
the
act
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
the
authority
would
be
the
sentiment
of
congress
as
expressed
in
that
house
conference
report.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
they
doubted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
if
the
board
had
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
supervisors.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
would
have
been
a
tenable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
however,
that
would
not,
i
submit,
give
effect
to
the
sentiment
as
expressed
in
the
house
conference
report
that
certain
other
employees
namely
those
concerned
working
in
the
labor
relations
employment
departments
and
confidential
employees
would
not
be
covered
by
the
act.
now
as
i
explained,
congress
was
mistaken
and
that
the
board
was
not
excluding
them
from
the
act,
it
was
merely
excluding
them
from
bargaining
units.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
that
is
correct
and
that
is
why
we
submit
that
we
put
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
the
employer
can
take
it
into
account
in
so
far
as
in
the
procurement
policy
manual
or
instructions
that
he
controls
the
discretion
of
the
buyer
or
to
point
out
that
that
should
not
be
a
factor
and
if
it
proves
to
be
a
factor,
i
suppose
it
would
be
grounds
for
discharge
but
it
is
a
long
way
for
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
chances
of
enforcing
it
are
not
that
remote
that
you
go
to
the
other
extreme
of
saying
that
a
whole
group
of
people
in
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
there
must
be
hundreds
of
thousands
of
buyers
should
be
denied
the
protection
of
the
act
if
they
wish
to
organize
and
bargain
collectively.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
the
board
had
in
the
swift
case,
lead
congress
when
it
amended
the
act
in
1959
to
believe
that
buyers
were
not
covered
by
the
act
and
therefore
the
fact
that
congress
in
1959
did
not
change
the
act,
should
be
deemed
to
fortify
the
view
that
buyers
were
not
covered
by
the
act.
now,
in
the
swift
case
in
1954
to
be
sure,
the
board
held
a
separate
unit
of
poultry
procurement
drivers
could
not
constitute
an
appropriate
unit
for
collective
bargaining
because
it
was
the
clearer
intent
of
congress
to
explode
from
the
coverage
of
the
act,
all
individuals
allied
with
management.
we
submit
that
this
was
an
inaccurate
statement
that
went
beyond
congress’
intent
in
1947.
it
was
contrary
to
numerous
board
decisions
immediately
after
the
enactment
of
the
1947
amendments
which
merely
held
that
managerial
employees
could
not
be
included
in
the
same
bargaining
unit
with
rank
and
file
employees.
the
fact
that
congress
in
1959
did
nothing,
we
further
submit
is
of
no
relevance
because
when
it
amended
the
act
in
1959,
there
is
nothing
in
those
amendments
which
dealt
in
so
far
as
the
basic
1959
changes
dealt
with
the
rights
of
labor
unions
under
landrum-griffin
recording
and
so
on.
and
the
only
amendments
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
were
to
strengthen
the
union
unfair
laborer
practices
against
secondary
boycotts
and
picketing.
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
that
anyone
brought
up
the
question
of
the
coverage
of
managerial
employees
or
the
congress
focused
on
that.
so
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
1959
amendments
were
enacted
without
any
change
in
the
managerial
definition
does
not
advance
our
analysis
of
one
with.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
i’ll
have
to
refer
the
court
to
our
brief
on
the
rulemaking
problem
in
the
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
of
a
substantive
nature
since
wyman-gordon
which
was
the
last
time
that
we
were
before
this
court
on
that
question.
the
board
has
enacted
two
rules
with
respect
to
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction
one
over
colleges
and
universities
and
the
other
over
symphony
orchestras.
this
rule,
after
a
rulemaking
proceeding
the
board
set
dollar
a
months
as
which
would
govern
the
exercise
of
its
discretionary
jurisdiction
over
these
industries.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
held
their
rulemaking
proceeding
with
respect
to
horse
racing
and
dog
racing
but
after
getting
in
the
views
of
the
various
interested
parties,
they
decided
not
to
assert
jurisdiction.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
this
would
be
to
the
trainers
and
the
personnel
of
it.
[laughter]
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
that
is
a
fair
statement,
however,
i
should
like
to,
if
i
might
take
a
few
more
minutes.
to
point
out
that,
although
the
accommodations
and
the
legal
scholars
find
that
the
board
should
use
it
more,
the
surprising
thing
has
bended
the
practitioners
before
the
board.
both
the
--
both
on
the
labor
and
management
side
and
this
has
been
the
subject
of
numerous
discussions
on
the
various
ab
--
american
bar
association
committees
are
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
board’s
continuing
to
treat
this
problems
via
the
adjudicative
root
and
have
been
uniformly
in
agreement
that
there
should
be
no
departure
from
past
practice.
of
course
that
is
not
the,
be
all
and
the
end
all,
but
it
indicates
that
the
board’s
customary
procedure
has
been
found
satisfactory.
now
the
other
part
of
the
problem
is
that
the
board,
unlike
many
other
administrative
agency
does
not
have
any
roving
commission
to
go
out
and
investigate
a
problem
and
then
promulgate
a
rule.
we
can
only
get
into
the
act
if
somebody
files
a
charge
with
this
or
somebody
files
a
petition
for
a
representation
election,
so
there
you
are
in
the
middle
of
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
where
the
facts
are
very
important
and
if
you
are
to
go
to
a
rulemaking
proceeding
at
that
point,
you
are
going
to
have
to
have
that
proceeding
marked
time
conduct
your
rulemaking
proceeding.
and
with
respect
to
many
of
the
provisions
that
we
administer
which
are
in
general
terms
and
where
facts
make
a
difference.
it’s
been
the
board’s
judgment
and
i
might
say
that
this
has
been
the
view,
this
is
something
that
the
board
has
been
consistent
on
your
respective
of
the
composition
to
the
board
that
when
you
got
through
with
all
of
that,
you
would
end
up
with
something
of
such
a
general
nature
that
it
would
not
be
of
much
value.
you’d
have
to
pick
up
your
adjudicatory
or
representation
proceeding
and
go
on
from
there.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
i
think
that
although
i
know
that
judge
friendly
has
been
very
vigorous
in
this
area
that
this
is,
i
believe
the
worst
possible
case
for
making
the
case
for
rulemaking.
i
think
that
we
were
much
more
vulnerable
in
wyman-gordon.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
and
the
principal
question
involves
the
extent
to
which
certain
kinds
of
employees
whom
the
board
calls
managerial
employees
are
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now
managerial
employees,
is
a
board
concept,
it’s
not
a
statutory
definition
and
the
board
has
defined
these
employees
--
as
employees
who
are
in
a
position
to
formulate,
determine
and
effectuate
management
policies.
the
category
as
i
will
show
is
not
limited
to
top
management,
nor
is
it
limited
to
persons
who
carry
out
labor
relations
policy.
but
it
includes
a
wide
range
of
minor
administrative
or
executive
personnel
such
as
buyers,
expediters,
claims
adjusters,
and
so
forth.
the
present
case
involves
buyers
employed
by
a
company
which
manufactures
and
sells
rocket
engines
and
electronic
equipment.
now
it
is
the
board’s
position
that
managerial
employees,
assuming
that
they
are
not
otherwise
exempt
as
supervisors
are
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
thus
entitled
to
organizational
and
bargaining
rights
under
the
act
unless
their
duties
are
concerned
with
labor
relations
or
other
matters
which
are
likely
to
cause
a
conflict
between
their
job
responsibilities
and
their
responsibilities
to
a
labor
organization.
the
court
below
on
the
other
hand
held
that
all
managerial
employees
are
exempt
from
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
will
show
that
that
is
based
upon
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history
which
i’ll
get
to
in
a
moment.
the
case
arises
in
this
factual
setting,
local
1286
of
the
auto
workers
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
seeking
certification
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
25
buyers
employed
in
the
purchasing
and
procurement
department
of
the
company’s
wheatfield,
new
york
plant.
the
company
opposed
the
petition
on
the
ground
that
the
buyers
were
managerial
employees
and
thus
excluded
from
the
acts
coverage.
at
a
hearing
before
the
board,
the
following
facts
were
established.
the
purchasing
and
procurement
department
fills
orders
from
30
other
departments.
this
involves
purchasing,
maintenance
and
repair
items
such
as
fuel
oil
and
light
bulbs,
support
items
such
as
packaging
and
paper
and
production
items
ranging
from
simple
nuts
and
bolts
to
sophisticated
components
for
the
equipment
of
the
company
manufacturers
and
about
70%
of
the
company’s
business
consists
of
parts
for
the
minute
man
missile
project.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
said
that
70%
of
the
company’s
business
are
materials
for
the
minute
man
missile
project,
some
of
which
has
nuts
and
bolts.
many
of
the
purchases
are
off
the
shelf
items
which
can
be
obtained
from
a
number
of
sources.
other
items
must
be
made
up
according
to
the
companies’
specific
needs.
the
buyers
in
this
proceeding
work
under
a
procurement
director
--
an
assistant
procurement
director,
two
purchasing
agents
and
four
supervisors.
there
are
seven
or
eighth
supervisory
personnel
over
the
buyers.
the
buyers
need
not
have
a
college
education
nor
does
the
company
have
any
formal
training
program
for
them.
they
are
guided
in
their
work
by
a
procurement
manual
and
other
written
instructions.
their
salaries
range
from
a
$195.00
to
$275.00
a
week.
they
are
not
paid
for
casual
over
time
but
they
are
compensated
for
scheduled
over
time
that
has
been
authorized
by
a
supervisor.
purchase
orders
are
initiated
by
requisition
from
the
various
departments.
these
codes
of
procurement
department
whether
they
are
assigned
to
a
supervisor
who
in
turn
assigns
them
to
a
particular
buyer.
requisitions
for
items
which
have
been
ordered
previously
generally
specify
a
particular
vendor.
where
no
vendor
has
been
designated
under
requisition,
the
buyer
is
free
to
select
one.
when
obtaining
sophisticated
production
items,
purchasing
decision
are
made
by
a
team
of
supervisory
personnel
from
the
engineering
quality
assurance
finance
and
manufacturing
departments
and
the
buyer
“x”
is
the
team
chairman.
the
buyers
may
place
or
cancel
orders
of
less
than
$5,000.00
on
their
own
signature.
larger
orders
however
require
supervisory
approval
with
higher
levels
of
supervision
required
as
the
cost
rises.
indeed
an
order
is
over
$5,000.00
the
buyer
is
required
to
conduct
pre
negotiations
with
supervisory
personnel
and
the
procurement
department
before
he
can
even
contact
a
potential
vendor.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
and
others
in
the
record,
the
board
assumed
that
the
buyers
were
managerial
employees
as
the
company
contended.
however
following
its
decision
in
north
arkansas
electric
where
it
held
that
managerial
employees
were
covered
by
the
act
and
entitled
to
representation
or
rights
there
under
unless
they
or
concerned
with
labor
relations
or
other
matters
it
would
present
the
conflict
of
interest
that
i
alluded
to
earlier.
the
board
concluded
that
the
company’s
buyers
were
not
in
this
category
and
therefore
covered
by
the
act.
the
board
rejected
the
company’s
claim
that
the
buyer’s
authority
to
commit
the
company’s
credit
and
to
select
suppliers
created
a
potential
conflict
of
interest.
in
that
the
buyers
would
be
more
receptive
to
higher
bids
from
unionized
contractors,
the
board
found
that
the
purchasing
discretion
of
the
buyer
was
neither
quoting
from
the
board
presently
so
on
bridled
or
potentially
so
uncontrollable
as
to
create
the
possible
problems
of
which
the
employer
complains.
and
the
board
then
found
that
a
unit
of
buyers
alone
would
constitute
an
appropriate
unit
for
collective
bargaining
directed
in
election
in
the
unit
which
the
union
want
--
certify
the
union.
the
company
refused
to
bargain
in
order
to
test
the
certification
the
board
issued
a
bargaining
order.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
indicated
rejected
the
board’s
view
that
managerial
employees
are
covered
by
the
act
except
where
a
conflict
of
interest
is
presented
and
hailed
that
a
managerial
employee
is
not
only
an
employee
that
would
present
a
conflict
of
interest
problem
but
any
one
who
has
formulating,
determining
or
effectuating
his
employer’s
policies
or
as
discretion
independent
of
an
employer’s
established
policy
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
if
you
fell
into
that
category
you
are
a
managerial
employee
and
not
covered
by
the
act.
however,
the
court
added
that
the
board
would
not
be
precluded
from
determining
that
the
buyer
is
here
or
some
types
of
them
might
not
be
managerial
employees
as
it
define
the
term
in
a
remand
of
the
case
to
the
board
for
such
a
determination
but
directed
the
board
to
do
so
via
a
role
making
proceeding
under
section
four
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
now
we
do
not
think
that
we
reach
that
issue
although
we
are
prepared
to
if
the
board’s
definition
of
managerial
employee
is
upheld.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
is
your
honor
as
i
will
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
there
is
a
case
--
the
swift
case
which
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
may
have
to
reach
that
if
you
are
persuaded
that
the
swift
case
is
not
an
aberration
through
change
of
board.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
now
i
like
to
get
to
what
we
have
been
doing.
section
23
of
the
wagner
act
provided
that
the
term
employee
shall
include
any
employee
but
shall
not
include
any
individual
employed
as
an
agricultural
laborer
or
into
domestic
service
of
any
family
or
person
at
his
home
or
any
individual
employed
by
his
parent
or
his
spouse.
now
the
board
early
ruled
that
since
the
statutory
definition
was
of
wide
comprehension
and
only
had
these
three
exclusions
in
it.
it
covered
all
other
employees
including
managerial
employees
and
supervisory
employees,
thus
the
discharge
of
managerial
or
supervisory
employees
were
engaging
in
union
activity
would
violate
section
81
and
3
of
the
wagner
act.
the
board
however
excluded
managerial
and
supervisory
employees
from
bargaining
units
of
rank
and
file
employees
on
the
ground
that
their
duties
are
closely
related
to
management.
with
respect
to
supervisors
because
that’s
where
most
of
the
action
occurred
under
the
wagner
act,
the
board
vacillated
between
holding
that
not
only
were
supervisors
not
included
but
then
rank
and
file
units
but
for
a
time
it
held
that
it
wasn’t
even
appropriate
to
put
them
in
a
unit
confined
as
supervisors.
but
the
board
changed
that
policy
in
the
packard
case
and
found
that
a
unit
of
supervisors
was
appropriate
for
bargaining.
the
packard
case
came
to
this
court
in
1947
and
this
court
by
a
five
to
four
vote
sustained
the
board’s
position
that
foreman
were
protected
by
the
act
and
that
a
unit
limited
to
foreman
or
supervisors
was
appropriate
for
collective
bargaining.
now
in
1947,
congress
turned
around
and
overturned
the
packard
decision
by
specifically
excluding
any
individual
employed
as
a
supervisor
from
the
section
23
definition
of
employee
and
thus
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
legislative
evolution
of
this
exclusion
however
is
very
significant,
the
house
bill
defined
a
supervisor
as
including
not
only
those
individuals
with
power
to
higher
transfer,
promote
and
discharge
or
discipline
other
employees
but
also
personnel
who
fix
or
make
effective
recommendation
with
respect
to
wages
earned
by
other
employees,
labor
relations,
timestudy,
police
and
guard
personnel
and
confidential
employees.
this
would
have
excluded
from
coverage
not
only
the
traditional
supervisors
but
many
of
the
individuals
whom
the
board
had
treated
as
managerial
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
what’s
that
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
in
so
far
as
they
would
have
been
excludable
as
supervisor.
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
one
in
that
position
that
would
not
have
met
the
supervisory
definition.
now
that
senate
bill
defined
the
term
supervisor
more
narrowly.
limiting
it
to
individuals
having
authority
to
higher
transfer,
suspend
layoff
and
so
on
the
traditional
indicia
of
a
supervisor.
the
senate
report
and
the
senate
debates
showed
that
the
narrower
senate
definition
represented
a
rejection
of
the
views
of
those
who
instead
of
merely
wanting
to
over
turn
packard
and
excludes
supervisors
with
genuine
management
prerogatives
from
the
act
wanted
to
exclude
wider
categories
of
employees.
at
a
conference
committee
accepted
the
senate’s
definition
of
supervisor
and
with
regard
to
those
additional
employees
would
been
included
within
the
house
but
not
the
senate
definition.
the
conference
reports
stated,
in
the
case
of
persons
working
in
the
labor
relations,
personnel
and
employment
departments,
it
was
not
thought
necessary
to
make
specific
provision
as
was
done
in
the
house
bill
since
the
board
has
treated
and
will
continue
to
treat
such
persons
as
outside
the
scope
of
the
act.
this
is
the
prevailing
board
practice
with
respect
to
such
people
as
confidential
secretaries
as
well.
they
went
on
to
say
that
they
were
not
excluding
timestudy
people
or
guards
nor
did
they
exclude
professional
employees.
now
the
house
conference
report,
in
so
far
as
it
stated
that
the
board
was
excluding
persons
working
in
the
labor
relations
personnel
and
employment
departments.
from
the
coverage
of
the
act,
it
was
mistaken
and
that
the
only
thing
that
the
board
had
done
with
respect
to
those
people
as
it
had
done
with
respect
to
supervisors
was
to
hold
that
they
were
not
appropriately
included
in
units
of
rank
and
file
or
office
or
in
clerical
employees
but
giving
that
conference
report,
the
benefit
of
what
of
the
misapprehension
that
the
conferees
were
under.
the
most
that
it
shows
was
an
intent
to
exclude
from
the
coverage
of
the
act
labor
relations
personnel
and
employees
in
the
employment
departments
and
confidential
employees.
the
buyers
here
and
most
other
of
the
managerial
employees
not
concerned
with
labor
relations
policy
certainly
do
not
fit
within
that
category.
now
the
reason
for
excluding
persons
in
the
labor
relations
and
employment
departments
from
coverage
is
that
people
with
those
duties
are
in
a
position
where
their
duties
could
bring
them
into
a
conflict
of
interest
situation
if
you
were
to
accord
them
unionization
rights.
the
board’s
test
of
what
managerial
employees
are
and
are
not
covered
by
the
act
we
submit
gives
effect
to
this
congressional
intention
that
those
types
of
employees
should
be
excluded
from
coverage.
whereas
on
the
other
hand,
the
broader
definition
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
what
exclude
from
coverage
not
only
managerial
employees
who
are
concerned
with
labor
relations
policies
but
any
other
employee
who
is
concerned
with
effectuating
the
employers
policies
would
exclude
from
coverage
thousands
of
employees
who
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
exclude.
it
would
exclude
many
employees
that
certainly
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
the
frontline
of
management
which
was
what
congress
was
careful
to
confine
itself
to
in
restricting
the
definition
of
supervisor
and
it
would
exclude
many
who
certainly
are
not
as
well
trained
as
professional
employees
whom
congress
did
not
exclude
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
only
provision
that
was
made
with
respect
to
professional
employees
was
to
say
that
before
you
can
group
them
with
in
a
unit
with
non
professionals,
you
have
to
give
them
a
self
determination
election.
now
what
are
the
reasons
which
lead
the
court
of
appeals
to
what
we
regard
as
a
misreading
of
the
congressional
intention?
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
unless
they
adopted
the
expansive
interpretation
of
managerial
employees
and
i
have
just
alluded
to.
you
would
not
be
giving
full
effect
to
this
court’s
decision
in
the
--
that
is
the
dissent
in
this
core
--
in
the
packard
case
which
to
be
sure
was
very,
very
responsible
for
the
exclusion
of
supervisors
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
now
in
packard
however,
the
dissent
as
we
read
it
was
concerned
with
putting
in
the
employer
category
all
those
who
acted
for
management,
not
only
in
formulating
but
in
also
executing
its
labor
policies.
the
boards’
conflict
of
interest
test
excludes
from
the
coverage
of
the
act
managerial
employees
who
are
so
involved
with
labor
policies.
now
the
court
below
also
said,
and
this
gets
back
i
believe
that
the
question
that
you
have
asked
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
if
you
would
interpret,
unless
you
interpret
managerial
employees
as
broadly
as
the
court
below
did,
it
could
lead
to
the
organization
of
vice
presidents
and
other
top
executives
which
was
prophesied
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
packard.
we
submit
that
the
board’s
test
does
not
do
that
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place
as
i
mentioned
before,
most
such
executives
are
likely
to
be
excluded
from
the
act
as
supervisors
and
those
who
do
not
meet
the
supervisory
definition.
what
probably
present
a
conflict
of
interest
situation
and
thus
would
be
the
type
of
managerial
employee
which
the
boards
test
would
exclude
from
the
act
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
the
authority
would
be
the
sentiment
of
congress
as
expressed
in
that
house
conference
report.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
they
doubted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
if
the
board
had
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
supervisors.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
would
have
been
a
tenable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
however,
that
would
not,
i
submit,
give
effect
to
the
sentiment
as
expressed
in
the
house
conference
report
that
certain
other
employees
namely
those
concerned
working
in
the
labor
relations
employment
departments
and
confidential
employees
would
not
be
covered
by
the
act.
now
as
i
explained,
congress
was
mistaken
and
that
the
board
was
not
excluding
them
from
the
act,
it
was
merely
excluding
them
from
bargaining
units.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
that
is
correct
and
that
is
why
we
submit
that
we
put
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
the
employer
can
take
it
into
account
in
so
far
as
in
the
procurement
policy
manual
or
instructions
that
he
controls
the
discretion
of
the
buyer
or
to
point
out
that
that
should
not
be
a
factor
and
if
it
proves
to
be
a
factor,
i
suppose
it
would
be
grounds
for
discharge
but
it
is
a
long
way
for
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
chances
of
enforcing
it
are
not
that
remote
that
you
go
to
the
other
extreme
of
saying
that
a
whole
group
of
people
in
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
there
must
be
hundreds
of
thousands
of
buyers
should
be
denied
the
protection
of
the
act
if
they
wish
to
organize
and
bargain
collectively.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
the
board
had
in
the
swift
case,
lead
congress
when
it
amended
the
act
in
1959
to
believe
that
buyers
were
not
covered
by
the
act
and
therefore
the
fact
that
congress
in
1959
did
not
change
the
act,
should
be
deemed
to
fortify
the
view
that
buyers
were
not
covered
by
the
act.
now,
in
the
swift
case
in
1954
to
be
sure,
the
board
held
a
separate
unit
of
poultry
procurement
drivers
could
not
constitute
an
appropriate
unit
for
collective
bargaining
because
it
was
the
clearer
intent
of
congress
to
explode
from
the
coverage
of
the
act,
all
individuals
allied
with
management.
we
submit
that
this
was
an
inaccurate
statement
that
went
beyond
congress’
intent
in
1947.
it
was
contrary
to
numerous
board
decisions
immediately
after
the
enactment
of
the
1947
amendments
which
merely
held
that
managerial
employees
could
not
be
included
in
the
same
bargaining
unit
with
rank
and
file
employees.
the
fact
that
congress
in
1959
did
nothing,
we
further
submit
is
of
no
relevance
because
when
it
amended
the
act
in
1959,
there
is
nothing
in
those
amendments
which
dealt
in
so
far
as
the
basic
1959
changes
dealt
with
the
rights
of
labor
unions
under
landrum-griffin
recording
and
so
on.
and
the
only
amendments
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
were
to
strengthen
the
union
unfair
laborer
practices
against
secondary
boycotts
and
picketing.
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
that
anyone
brought
up
the
question
of
the
coverage
of
managerial
employees
or
the
congress
focused
on
that.
so
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
1959
amendments
were
enacted
without
any
change
in
the
managerial
definition
does
not
advance
our
analysis
of
one
with.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
i’ll
have
to
refer
the
court
to
our
brief
on
the
rulemaking
problem
in
the
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
of
a
substantive
nature
since
wyman-gordon
which
was
the
last
time
that
we
were
before
this
court
on
that
question.
the
board
has
enacted
two
rules
with
respect
to
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction
one
over
colleges
and
universities
and
the
other
over
symphony
orchestras.
this
rule,
after
a
rulemaking
proceeding
the
board
set
dollar
a
months
as
which
would
govern
the
exercise
of
its
discretionary
jurisdiction
over
these
industries.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
held
their
rulemaking
proceeding
with
respect
to
horse
racing
and
dog
racing
but
after
getting
in
the
views
of
the
various
interested
parties,
they
decided
not
to
assert
jurisdiction.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
this
would
be
to
the
trainers
and
the
personnel
of
it.
[laughter]
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
that
is
a
fair
statement,
however,
i
should
like
to,
if
i
might
take
a
few
more
minutes.
to
point
out
that,
although
the
accommodations
and
the
legal
scholars
find
that
the
board
should
use
it
more,
the
surprising
thing
has
bended
the
practitioners
before
the
board.
both
the
--
both
on
the
labor
and
management
side
and
this
has
been
the
subject
of
numerous
discussions
on
the
various
ab
--
american
bar
association
committees
are
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
board’s
continuing
to
treat
this
problems
via
the
adjudicative
root
and
have
been
uniformly
in
agreement
that
there
should
be
no
departure
from
past
practice.
of
course
that
is
not
the,
be
all
and
the
end
all,
but
it
indicates
that
the
board’s
customary
procedure
has
been
found
satisfactory.
now
the
other
part
of
the
problem
is
that
the
board,
unlike
many
other
administrative
agency
does
not
have
any
roving
commission
to
go
out
and
investigate
a
problem
and
then
promulgate
a
rule.
we
can
only
get
into
the
act
if
somebody
files
a
charge
with
this
or
somebody
files
a
petition
for
a
representation
election,
so
there
you
are
in
the
middle
of
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
where
the
facts
are
very
important
and
if
you
are
to
go
to
a
rulemaking
proceeding
at
that
point,
you
are
going
to
have
to
have
that
proceeding
marked
time
conduct
your
rulemaking
proceeding.
and
with
respect
to
many
of
the
provisions
that
we
administer
which
are
in
general
terms
and
where
facts
make
a
difference.
it’s
been
the
board’s
judgment
and
i
might
say
that
this
has
been
the
view,
this
is
something
that
the
board
has
been
consistent
on
your
respective
of
the
composition
to
the
board
that
when
you
got
through
with
all
of
that,
you
would
end
up
with
something
of
such
a
general
nature
that
it
would
not
be
of
much
value.
you’d
have
to
pick
up
your
adjudicatory
or
representation
proceeding
and
go
on
from
there.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
i
think
that
although
i
know
that
judge
friendly
has
been
very
vigorous
in
this
area
that
this
is,
i
believe
the
worst
possible
case
for
making
the
case
for
rulemaking.
i
think
that
we
were
much
more
vulnerable
in
wyman-gordon.
