unknown
speaker
what
--
mr.
come,
what’s
the
board’s
theory
on
the
--
you
say
this
is
not
a
statutory
concepts.
it’s
a
pure
board
case
by
case
definition?
unknown
speaker
and
pursuant
to
what
authority
did
it
report
to
include
--
to
say
exclude
the
recovery
to
managerial
employees
of
any
kind
other
than
supervisors?
unknown
speaker
since
the
1947
amendments,
what
is
this,
a
second
--
a
revised
definition?
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
i
am
sorry.
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
but
the
second
circuit
said
that
you
have
already
defined
or
held
that
buyers
were
managerial
and
covered
and
if
you
could
not
change
your
mind
now
without
a
rule.
unknown
speaker
so
we
would
have
to
even,
even
if
he
would
have
been
correct
for
the
first
instance
in
defining
buyers
as
covered
by
the
act.
in
fact,
that
the
second
circumstance
that
you
didn’t
and
that
even
though
you
could
with
the
right
procedures
will
change
your
mind
now
you
have
to
follow
the
procedures.
unknown
speaker
we
would
have
to
also
disagree
with
the
second
--
we’d
have
to
disagree
with
the
second
circuit
to
as
to
the
reading
as
to
what
you
have
done.
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn’t
by
its
terms
if
excluded
the
president
of
the
company
that
would.
unknown
speaker
yes
i
--
just
taking
that
exclusion
as
you
have
discussed
it,
it
wouldn’t
by
its
terms
exclude
either
the
president
or
the
vice
president
of
the
company
as
i
understand?
unknown
speaker
and
what
--
unknown
speaker
--
would
that
prove
is
the
authority
for
going
beyond
the
definition
of
supervisor
that
congress,
that
there
are
in
1947
amendment?
unknown
speaker
was
the
term
employee
that
came
after
was
the
definition
that
the
employee
was
also
meant
by
that?
unknown
speaker
it
exclude
the
supervisors
as
the
kind
of
--
unknown
speaker
to
me
arguably
the
way
you,
you
can
only
exclude
--
unknown
speaker
supervisors,
maybe
some
of
them
you
might
put
a
label
on
like
managerial
but
they
still
have
to
be
supervisors
right
in
the
end.
unknown
speaker
well
maybe
those
two
categories
but
that
is
a
long
way
to
find.
unknown
speaker
that
would
also
put
a
long
way
for
many
other
group
that
you
might
say,
so
while
that
in
employee-employer
policy
that
there
might
be
a
conflict.
that’s
the
board’s
view,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
that’s
a
lot
broader
issue
of
complaint.
unknown
speaker
it
is
difficult
to
try
--
thing
to
enforce,
is
it
not,
as
this
is
so
often
the
case
with
conflicts
of
interest?
unknown
speaker
horse
racing
and
dog
racing
too,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
limitations
on
the
buyers
apparent
to
select
the
seller?
unknown
speaker
does
top
management
provide
the
buyer
with
a
list
of
manufacturers
who
are
deemed
technically
competent
to
produce
sophisticated
equipment
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
perspective
supplier
is
on
the
list,
then
the
buyer
has
the
authority
to
make
the
decision?
unknown
speaker
are
any
of
the
buyers
here,
the
20
odd
buyers
here
mr.
moot
have
professional
engineering
training?
unknown
speaker
but
the
board
isn’t
that
north
arkansas
case?
unknown
speaker
this
isn’t
really
any
different
what
they
did
there,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
north
arkansas
overruled
swift
three
years
ago.
unknown
speaker
that’s
three
years
ago.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry,
i
can’t
find
it,
did
you
say
page
8?
unknown
speaker
oh!
yes.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
and
the
hearing
officer
says,
“mr.
winch,
briefly
what
is
the
position
of
the
company
as
the
appropriateness
of
the
unit?”
and
mr.
winch
replies,
“the
employees
within
the
named
unit
are
managerial
employees
and
secondarily
have
no
community
of
interest.”
the
community
of
interest
that
matter
did
not
survive
in
the
hearing
and
the
question
then
resolved
as
to
whether
they
were
or
were
not
managerial
employees.”
the
representative
for
the
uaw
at
the
conclusion
of
approval,
i
am
now
turning
to
page
83
of
the
record,
in
which
he
was
stating
what
he
wanted
to
prove.
this
is
the
uaw
representative
himself,
i
would
like
to
have
the
record
show
that
this
adjournment
was
granted
solely
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
union
an
opportunity
to
produce
evidence
that
the
buyers
are
not
managerial
employees
and
for
no
other
purpose.
unknown
speaker
what
happened
when
you
got
to
the
board?
unknown
speaker
they
must
have
followed
their
own
north
american.
unknown
speaker
north
arkansas.
unknown
speaker
what
page
are
you
on?
unknown
speaker
what
page?
unknown
speaker
oh!
we
don’t
have
that.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
first
part
of
that
proposition
now
as
judge
friendly
was
based
on
his
theory
that
congress
had
reenact
of
what
have
been
a
board
deal.
unknown
speaker
well
what
else
was
it
based
on?
unknown
speaker
but
you
got
the
problem
not
only
of,
not
only
saying
what
more
attracted
was
but
the
congress
froze
it
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
--
unknown
speaker
so
you
just
rely
on
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
write
it
correctly.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
we’ve
go
to
reread
it.
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
though
that
we
disagree
with
you
on
whether
the
congress
froze
that
privilege
and
the
question
is
made
of
board
that
change
his
mind.
accepting
your
view
of
swift
and
of
north
arkansas
that
change
the
rule,
was
it
permissible
to
the
point
of
where
the
changes
find
in
an
adjudicatory
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
authority
to
that
isn’t
it,
other
than
what
judgment
we’re
reviewing?
unknown
speaker
let’s
put
this
if
we
will
in
to
pragmatic
posture
it
was
when
it
came
to
us
as
counselor
for
an
employer
and
here
we
have
unbroken
line
of
cases
from
the
taft-hartley
act
forward
which
said
managerial
employees
of
this
type
were
outside
the
protection
of
the
acts
spending
a
significant
amount
of
money
of
the
company.
unknown
speaker
we
certainly
approve
a
lot
of
mind
changes
without
a
rule.
unknown
speaker
mr.
moot,
i
just
heard
earlier
this
term,
i
hope
to
remember
the
name
of
it
since
i
wrote
it
on
account
ago.
we
dealt
with
thisproblem
of
the
board
changing
its
mind.
i
think
was
the
definition
was
successful
corporation,
purposes
of
liability
of
order
issued
against
the
predecessor
and
it
never
occurred
to
us
to
suggest
ruling
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
as
i
understood
your
recitation
of
what
happened
to
this
case
when
the
board
got
around
we
decided
the
case
and
issuing
its
order.
it
did
take
cognizance
of
north
arkansas.
unknown
speaker
and
it
did
give
its
decision
for
the
north
arkansas.
unknown
speaker
and
on
conflict.
unknown
speaker
now
on
that
record,
on
the
record
that
it
had
before
it
whether
you
try
to
dump
that
theory
or
not,
the
board
apparently
thought
the
record
adequate
and
that
you
weren’t
on
that
due
process
or
anything
by
their
deciding
the
case
on
the
north
arkansas
basis.
unknown
speaker
now
judge
friendly
seems
to
think
that
that
you
could
not
affirm
--
that
you
did
not
decide
this
case
on
the
north
arkansas
basis.
unknown
speaker
what
he
actually
said
was,
“we
cannot
be
sure
that
the
board’s
decision
rested
on
such
a
factual
examination
rather
than
that’s
new
and
in
our
view
erroneous
wholly.”
i
didn’t
felt
that
would
generate
problem
involved?
unknown
speaker
you
just
said
that
that
you
let
the
board
did
pitch
this
decision
on
north
arkansas.
unknown
speaker
you
are
starting
to
read
something
from
the
brief
of
the
general
counsel.
unknown
speaker
sometime
ago
when
we
interrupted
you
we
asked
to
--
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
in
what
case
and
when?
unknown
speaker
but
sometime
in
1970
to
1971.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
one
of
the
approaches
the
board
had
been
not
to
define
that
the
managerial
employees
has
excluded
employees
but
as
that
they
are
employer.
it
defined
the
term
employer
to
include
the
managerial
employee.
that
is
what
this
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
they
said.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
they
said
in
north
africa
--
north
arkansas,
that
they
would
construe,
that
the
question
at
some
managerial
employee
is
whether
they
are
thought
to
be
as
employers
or
an
employee.
unknown
speaker
what
--
mr.
come,
what’s
the
board’s
theory
on
the
--
you
say
this
is
not
a
statutory
concepts.
it’s
a
pure
board
case
by
case
definition?
unknown
speaker
and
pursuant
to
what
authority
did
it
report
to
include
--
to
say
exclude
the
recovery
to
managerial
employees
of
any
kind
other
than
supervisors?
unknown
speaker
since
the
1947
amendments,
what
is
this,
a
second
--
a
revised
definition?
unknown
speaker
[voice

i
am
sorry.
unknown
speaker
mr.

decide
this
case
on
the
north
arkansas
basis.
unknown
speaker
what
he
actually
said
was,
“we
cannot
be
sure
that
the
board’s
decision
rested
on
such
a
factual
examination
rather
than
that’s
new
and
in
our
view
erroneous
wholly.”
i
didn’t
felt
that
would
generate
problem
involved?
unknown
speaker
you
just
said
that
that
you
let
the
board
did
pitch
this
decision
on
north
arkansas.
unknown
speaker
you
are
starting
to
read
something
from
the
brief
of
the
general
counsel.
unknown
speaker
sometime
ago
when
we
interrupted
you
we
asked
to
--
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
in
what
case
and
when?
unknown
speaker
but
sometime
in
1970
to
1971.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
one
of
the
approaches
the
board
had
been
not
to
define
that
the
managerial
employees
has
excluded
employees
but
as
that
they
are
employer.
it
defined
the
term
employer
to
include
the
managerial
employee.
that
is
what
this
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
they
said.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
they
said
in
north
africa
--
north
arkansas,
that
they
would
construe,
that
the
question
at
some
managerial
employee
is
whether
they
are
thought
to
be
as
employers
or
an
employee.
