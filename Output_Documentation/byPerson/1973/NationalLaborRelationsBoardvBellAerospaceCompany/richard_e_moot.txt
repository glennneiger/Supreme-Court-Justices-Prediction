mr.
richard
e.
moot
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
mr.
richard
moot
from
buffalo.
we
represent
the
bell
aerospace
company,
a
division
of
textron.
our
firm
has
represented
this
company
and
its
predecessor
the
old
bell
aircraft
company
for
great
many
years.
my
partner,
now
deceased,
mr.
winch
handled
the
original
proceedings
before
the
epic
time
of
the
hearing.
i
would
like
at
the
beginning
just
to
mention
the
facts
briefly
where
we
believe
the
statement
of
facts
is
somewhat
lacking
and
then
to
give
you
the
points
which
i
will
make
here
this
afternoon
which
are
very
brief.
the
buyers
in
this
case
who
petitioned
to
be
represented
under
the
labor
management
relation
act
were
25
in
number.
the
job
description
called
for
preferred
or
senior
buyer
and
that
was
the
largest
number
of
them
of
a
college
education
with
a
business
administration
specially.
now
it’s
true
that
many
of
them
did
not
have
them
and
that
was
not
covered
at
the
hearing
but
six
years,
practical
experience
was
considered
a
substitute
for
it.
in
this
case,
the
buyers
and
may
i
just
say
that
our
business
was
not
either
burning
fuel
oil
or
burning
out
electric
light
bulbs
as
the
brief
might
suggest.
we
are
contractor,
very
heavily
in
research
and
development
and
70%
of
our
business
is
the
guidance
package,
propulsion
package
for
the
minute
man
missile.
a
large
part
of
which
is
tailor
made,
the
most
exact
specifications.
the
buyers
in
this
case
had
the
prime
responsibility,
two-fold
of
seeing
a
steady
flow
of
a
necessary
material,
special
tools
and
components
came
to
the
plant
at
belt
so
that
the
production
schedule
for
our
missile
man
would
stay
on
line.
second,
they
had
the
responsibility
to
see
that
this
was
done
with
the
maximum
economy
of
the
company,
their
employer’s
money.
one
buyer,
senior
buyer
in
this
case
in
the
19th-month
period
which
we
are
talking
about,
spent
$1,300,000.00
as
on
an
issue
taking
collectively
the
amount
that
he
purchased
on
his
own
say
so
alone,
the
group
in
total.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
19
months.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
in
19
months
period
the
group
of
25
together
spent
$7,600,000.00
on
their
own
initiative.
collectively,
they
participated
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
but
on
their
signature.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
collectively
in
the
same
period,
the
group
of
25
supervised
or
participated
in
the
procurement
of
material
in
the
amount
of
$41,300,000.00.
now
i
say
those
facts
so
that
we’ll
not
be
mislead
in
talking
about
buyers
to
think
opening
up
the
catalogue
to
see
this
rollback
and
saying,
“where
are
they
going
to
get
this
or
that
piece
of
pottery
to
stock
the
shelf?”
we
are
not
talking
about
light
bulbs,
fuel
oil,
packing
paper
or
shelf
items
which
are
constantly
being
mentioned
in
the
opposing
brief.
if
best,
that
is
now
i
will
be
quite
frank
an
attempt
to
mislead
the
court
as
to
the
nature
of
the
duties
here.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
we
are
talking,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
are
talking
about
special
components
for
minute
man
missile.
highly
complex
electronic
devices,
in
many
cases
it
is
cheaper
for
our
client
bell
to
buy
say
a
black
box
from
minneapolis
honeywell
than
would
be
to
ask
the
people
in
the
plant
to
make
it.
wherever
they
are
asking
for
a
guiding
system
or
any
part
of
a
guiding
system
or
an
intricate
valve,
no,
one
of
the
control
valves
for
minute
man.
if
that
can
be
made
more
cheaply
and
better
outside
the
plant,
then
that’s
the
buyers
job,
to
find
somebody
who
can
do
it
and
have
it
built
outside
the
plant
and
brought
in
and
in
the
appendix
into
the
record
here.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
act
on
their
own
initiative.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
are
not
being
exempt
as
supervisors.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right.
they
are
acting
as
a
part
of
management
and
in
this,
buyers
act
as
a
team.
they
include
engineering,
quality
control,
financial
and
the
buyers
himself
acts
as
captain
of
that
team
but
he
does
not
perform
his
job
at
the
desk
at
the
bell
plant.
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
visit
the
various
sub-contractors
or
parties
where
the
material,
special
tools
or
special
components
is
either
being
designed
or
being
built.
he
has
responsibilities
to
see
that
the
production
dates
and
schedules
are
maintained.
if
a
strike
occurs
at
this
supplier’s
plant,
any
dollar
amount
is
under
$5,000.00
he
can
cancel
it
at
the
strike
of
the
plant
and
put
it
in
a
non-union
plant
in
order
to
ensure
the
orderly
flow
of
necessary
components
to
the
assembly
of
the
minute
man
missile.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
have
it
as
the
proof
shows
here,
the
authority
to
decide
to
make
or
buy.
they
also
have
the
authority
under
$5,000.00
to
change
from
the
recommended
source
if
some
department
in
bell
recommends
a
given
source.
they
can
change
that
source
if
it’s
under
$5,000.00.
if
it’s
over
$5,000.00
they
can
make
an
investigation
and
report
and
it
goes
up
the
ladder.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
but
again
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
make
a
recommendation.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
make
a
recommendation
and
after
the
recommendation
is
reviewed
but
i
am
sure
your
honor
will
know
that
where
the
work
has
been
carefully
done
at
that
level.
the
question
on
review
is,
is
it
documented?
is
the
satisfactory
piece
of
work
but
the
knowledge
and
the
specialty
and
the
know
how
to
make
an
intelligent
recommendation
there
rests
with
the
bar
and
the
overwhelming
case
is
the
proof
in
this
record
shows
if
he
is
sustained
on
review.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
he
is
--
yes
there
is
and
this
is
why
he
is
part
of
management.
his
limitation
is
he
must
select
the
supplier
which
is
going
to
do
it
most
economically
for
the
company
and
in
the
record
here.
about
15
pages
of
cost
reductions
achieved
by
selecting
a
buyer
sometimes
other
than
the
one
designated
because
they
could
get
a
better
price.
he
has
a
characteristic
function
of
management
to
try
and
conduct
the
business
of
the
company
in
a
more
economical
manner
but
he
has
no
restrictions
on
whether
he
should
buy
union
or
non-union
and
if
he
thinks
he
can
get
a
better
price
in
non-union,
he
buys
a
non-union.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
there
are
regulations
with
respect
to
or
guides
that
people
have
used
before
and
people
have
been
approved
by
the
department
of
defense
and
other
guidelines,
yes
there
are.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
think
he
has
the
right
to
go
off
the
list
too
in
certain
cases.
now,
if
i
my
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
think
and
again
this
was
not
detailed
name
by
name
in
the
proof
that
i
read
the
record.
they
experienced
in
this
case
was
predominantly
learned
on
the
job.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell
that’s
--
i
was
hopeful
i
can
get
to
that
before
more
of
my
time
was
gone.
that
is
certainly
true
and
the
point
i
want
to
make
and
i
have
only
made
this
one
point
this
afternoon,
i
believe
i
will
serve
my
client
well.
the
rule
that
is
being
espoused
in
this
case
is
new
and
makes
no
mistake
about
it.
the
position
that
mr.
judge
friendly
below
is
very
simple,
he
said,
“where
there
is
a
well
established
rule
as
what
is
management
and
what
is
not
the
management,
you
stick
by
the
rule
unless
if
you
are
going
either
rulemaking
or
back
to
the
congress.”
now
let
me
just
make
this
point.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
did
and
let
me
just
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
the
point
exactly
i
am
making
is
that
north
arkansas
is
a
new
rule
and
north
arkansas
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
exactly
and
the
claim
made
in
brief
here
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
but
this
proceeding
began
in
1970
and
at
the
time
this
hearing
was
conducted,
north
arkansas
had
not
been
decided,
as
a
matter
of
struck
--
fact
by
strange
coincidence,
the
decision
was
dated
in
north
arkansas
august
27,
1970
and
the
hearing
officer
began
proof
in
this
case
august
28,
1970.
and
if
i
just
brief
a
short
departmental
record
to
make
how
clear
it
is
that
this
conflict
of
interest
rule
which
they
now
say
they
have
all
along.
the
claim
in
brief
here
is,
that
swift
is
an
aberration
and
at
from
the
time
of
1947,
the
taft-hartley
amendment
and
the
overturning
of
practice
that
all
along
they
have
excluded
or
excuse
me,
they
have
said
managerial
employees
are
only
excluded
if
they
are
in
labor
relations
or
if
they
present
a
potential
conflict
of
interest
or
statutory,
i
think
as
mr.
justice
white
points
out
exclusion
like
supervisors.
and
we
say
that
this
simply
is
not
so,
the
conflict
of
interest
rule
is
just
as
new
as
the
north
arkansas.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes
and
what
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
where
justice
friendly
below
and
general
counsel
for
are
the
board
have
parted
company
its
position.
judge
friendly
below
that
where
a
long
line
of
cases
from
1947
up
to
1970
have
said
that
buyers
who
spend
significant
amounts
of
the
company’s
money
with
significant
independent
discretion
have
been
considered
a
part
of
management
and
not
covered
by
the
act
and
we
are
in
a
long
line
of
cases
such
as
that
is
well
established
and
you
wish
to
change
it.
we
should
adopt
rulemaking
otherwise
it
leads
to
practitioner
and
we
certainly
don’t
adopt
the
view
the
american
bar
association
or
any
one
else
that
we
want
to
have
a
new
rule
as
to
what
is
management
and
to
what
is
labor
produced
by
this
case
or
any
other
case.
if
we
are
going
to
make
a
change
and
how
they
decided
this
cases
from
1947
up
to
1970
which
is
the
date
of
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
no,
let
me
just
point
that
out.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
quite
understandably
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
don’t
read
the
slip
opinion
from
the
national
labors
relations
board
on
a
24-hour
basis.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
i
am
going
to
read
that
right
from
the
record.
i
am
pleased
to
have
your
question.
the
hearing
officer
says
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
page
8.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
hearing
officer
asks
my
associate
or
my
partner
mr.
winch,
“briefly
what
is
the
position
of
the
company?”
and
mr.
winch
replies
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
page
8.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
no,
nor
mr.
justice
brennan,
was
the
matter
of
conflict
of
interest,
the
very
thing
which
in
brief
now
they
say
must
be
determined
factual
questions
to
be
determined
was
not
even
mentioned.
there
was
no
argument
with
respect
to
conflict
of
interest
at
the
time
of
approval.
the
first
time
conflict
of
interest
entered
this
case.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
when
i
got
to
the
board,
the
board
conceded
that
these
were
managerial
employees
and
a
part
of
management
but
they
said
we
have
the
right.
that
will
be
by
next
question.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
north
arkansas.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
they
did
and
they
said
by
brief,
if
i
can
read
again.
now
this
is
positioned
directly
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
brief
in
this
court
which
we
find
somewhat
embarrassing.
they
said,
“while
the
board’s
decision
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
what’s
that?
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
am
on
the
brief
for
the
board
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well,
i
believe
it
is
filed
with
the
court
but
i
am
not
sure
it’s
in
front
of
you
but
we
also
put
it
in
our
brief,
and
they
say,
“while
the
board’s
decision
in
north
arkansas
and
the
instant
case
marked
a
change
in
board
policy,
it
is
well
settled
that
the
board
may
change
its
policy
if
in
doing
so
it
does
not
act
arbitrarily.”
now
this
is
where
judge
friendly
said,
“if
you
are
going
to
change
and
say,
what
is
always
been
a
part
of
management
and
say
that’s
not
management
or
say
if
you
will,
that
management
has
the
right
to
organize
and
bargain
under
the
act
with
management
if
you
cannot
show
that
it
is
labor
sensitive
or
in
a
conflict
of
interest.”
judge
friendly
and
the
eighthh
circuit
both
read
the
legislative
history
to
say
that
that’s
absolutely
off,
that
when
congress
originally
passed
the
act;
it
was
designed
in
answer
to
your
other
question
mr.
justice
white,
to
provide
a
set
of
ground
rules
for
management
to
bargain
with
labor.
it
was
never
intended
that
management
would
bargain
with
non-labor
sensitive
management
and
that
was
the
position
that
mr.
judge
friendly
took
and
he
said,
“if
you
want
to
establish
a
rule
now
that
managerial
employees,
part
of
management
have
the
right
to
organize
and
bargain
with
other
management
if
they
are
outside
the
labor
relations
department
or
if
they
are
not
in
a
conflict
of
interest
situation,
you
go
back
to
congress
with
that
argument.”
but
he
said,
“if
what
you
are
trying
to
say
is
that
buyers
whom
for
this
whole
period
from
1947
to
1970,
on
similar
facts
situations,
without
exceptions
during
that
period,
the
board
had
treated
as
they
did
on
swift
and
american
locomotive
and
treated
those
type
of
employees
as
a
part
of
management
and
said
that
they
were
outside
that.
he
said,
now
if
you
want
to
save
buyers
who
are
not
really
part
of
management,
you
want
to
change
your
mind
that
you
should
go
through
rulemaking
to
do
that
and
we
think
that
that
rule
is
eminently
sensible
one.
but
if
they
want
to
establish
two
categories
of
management
and
have
management
bargained
with
management
that
is
for
congress.
if
you
want
to
change
a
well
established
definition
as
to
what
is
part
of
management,
buyers
under
factual
situations
similar
to
what
we
have
here.
we
should
do
that
with
rulemaking.
i
think
the
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
in
part.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
think
it
was
based
upon
the
original
approach
and
handling
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
when
it
was
first
passed.
that
the
national
relations
act
went
first
passed
did
not
attempt
to
define
what
was
management
in
all
inclusive
terms.
it
was
assumed
that
if
it
was
management,
it
was
on
one
side
and
labor
was
on
the
other
side
and
the
first
major
dispute
over
that
arose
in
packard
and
where
in
packard
they
said
that
foreman
are
not
a
part
of
management
and
they
are
covered.
congress
quickly
corrected
that
and
said
they
should
not
be
--
they
should
be
excluded
from
the
act
and
that
was
done
but
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
had
certainly
throughout
its
whole
history
hold
purposes
to
provide
a
system
of
ground
rules
between
management
on
one
side
and
labor
on
the
other
and
no
attempt,
i
don’t
believe
mr.
justice
white
was
ever
made
to
say
the
following
shall
constitute
management
and
the
following
shall
constitute
labor.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
certainly
that
was
what
the
eighthh
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
did.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
after
a
long
period
of
time
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
did
considering
the
number
of
years.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes
it
is
and
all
i
can
say
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white
is
that
we
agree
with
the
legislative
history
arguments
in
both
the
eighthh
circuit
and
the
second
circuit.
but
the
point
which
is
i
am
trying
to
make,
and
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
here
is
that
when
they
came
to
north
arkansas
they
changed
the
rules
and
that
swift
is
not
as
they
now
claim
an
aberration
that
the
rule
was
well
established
from
1947,
time
of
taft-hartley
act
to
1950.
let
me
just
read
from
general
counsel’s
brief
in
the
north
arkansas
case.
now
this
is
general
counsel
from
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
i
understand
that
and
all
i
can
say
in
a
time
allotted
here
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
of
the
two,
i
think
that
both
the
eighth
circuit
and
second
circuit.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
were
correct
mr.
richard
e.
moot
and
i
think
that
they
have
given
full
weighth
to
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
expect
that
is
true
but
i
think
that
where
in
attempting
to
get
around
this
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
that
is
and
i
think
that
the
operations
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
i
certainly
are
in
mr.
judge
friendly’s
corner
on
that.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
were
primarily
charged
with
economy
and
management
of
the
company
and
its
fund
and
their
exempt.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well,
what
we’re
saying
is
that
where
such
a
major
departure
is
going
to
be
made
from
a
well
established
line
of
cases
that
it
is
either
for
congress
which
is
amended
it
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
overturning
fact
or
it
is
for
rulemaking.
that’s
our
position
but
i
think
the
reason
why
in
this
court
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
i
think,
quite
honestly
if
you
are
going,
to
me,
the
argument
that
is
appealing
to
me
is
the
lawyer
is
if
you
are
going
to
change
what
you
have
always
considered
to
be
management.
although
it
is
going
to
change
the
jurisdictional
ground
of
this
statute
but
that’s
something
congress
ought
to
be
doing
and
we
ought
not
to
be
doing
it
on
a
single
case.
that
is
more
appealing
to
me
that
this
is
for
the
legislature
not
the
courts.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well,
that’s
the
very
advice
here
and
the
leap
happens
to
come
after
we
have
the
hearing,
after
the
very
factual
issue
which
is
supposed
to
be
determined
on
each
case
is
over.
we
never
got
the
conflict
of
interest
because
it
was
not
the
law.
mr.
winch
had
practiced
in
his
field
for
40
years.
he
never
heard
of
it,
the
hearing
officer
had
not
heard
of
it
and
uaw
representative
have
not
heard
of
this
rule.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
none
whatsoever
mr.
justice
powell.
it’s
that
new
and
the
idea
that
swift
is
an
aberration
which
is
being
urged
to
find
your
honor
by
the
pre-period
it
is
absolutely
false.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
it
was
not
argued
before
the
board?
mr.
richard
e.
moot
we
asked
to
reconsider
it,
the
eighth
circuit
does
not
agree
with
it.
they
said,
“we
do
not
have
to
reconsider,
we
were
right
in
the
first
place.”
now
we
got
two
seconds
--
two
circuit
courts
which
say
this
is
management
and
it’s
not
covered.
we
said
we
don’t
care,
we’ll
still
persist
for
this
rule
and
the
pragmatics
of
applying
conflict
of
interest
just
opened
a
whole
host
of
grounds.
i
will
leave
it
there
because
i
see
i
only
have
few
minutes.
i
do
not
think
and
i
agree
with
mr.
chief
justice,
the
test
of
conflict
of
interest
must
be
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
apply
because
if
the
fact
and
circumstances
change,
whether
articulate
part
of
management
is
in
a
conflict
of
interest
will
change.
people
may
be
in
one
time
and
out
another,
an
example
from
our
own
very
own
company.
decision
is
made
from
a
corporate
point
of
view,
to
take
the
principal
production
from
wheatfield
and
move
it
to
texas
and
labor
costs
were
a
significant
part
of
that.
it
had
a
very
stormy
production.
labor
negotiation
history
neither
peninsula.
many
people
would
have
to
participate
on
that
move
from
wheatfield
to
texas.
once
made,
the
same
people
might
have
no
labor
sensitive
input
whatsoever
in
the
management
but
they
might
be
highly
labor
sensitive
or
in
a
position
of
conflict
of
interest
while
that
decision
of
opening
a
separate
plant
in
the
south
was
before
that
came
afterwards,
they
wouldn’t
be.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
that’s
what
they
thought.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
he
thought
north
arkansas
was
wrong
and
secondly
said
you
couldn’t
tell
which
way
they
have
decided.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right
and
you
can’t
tell
that
he
is
starring
this
record
which
way
they
decided
it.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
i
said
that.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
to
this
extent
that
they
conceded
that
the
buyers
were
managerial
both
in
brief
and
by
argument,
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
tell
that
they
apparently
made
that
concession
but
as
judge
friendly
said
when
i
argued
the
case
in
front
of
him.
in
fact
the
board’s
conceded
it
does
not
mean
that
it
is
so.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
it’s
true
and
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
make
evidence
on
potential
conflict
of
interest
because
the
real
conflict
of
interest
often
does
not
develop
until
you
organize
a
part
of
management.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
in
two
days
or
i
think
it
began
at
28th
at
the
month
of
september
the
third
so
maybe
a
weeks
time
altogether.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
no
they
didn’t
but
we
did
that
and
put
it
in
the
addendum
of
our
brief
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
it’s
true.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes
but
the
decision
was
on
our
side
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes
but
--
we
were
on
a
representation
case
and
the
eighth
circuit
had
made
it
clear
that
a
managerial
employee
of
the
type
in
north
arkansas
did
not
qualify
for
representation
as
well
their
first
decision.
and
so
we’re
quite
correct
in
saying
conflict
of
interest
is
not
approvable
matter
in
this
hearing
because
it
never
have
been
before
and
the
eighth
circuits
said
it
should
not
be.
and
so
the
here
hearing
officer,
the
uaw
representative
or
mr.
winch
who
has
spent
40
years
in
this
field
attempted
proof
of
because
it
wasn’t
proper.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
but
i
am
happy
to
answer
any
more
questions
but
i
believe
if
i
made
my
one
point
and
made
it
to
the
best
of
my
ability
that
they
are
espousing
a
new
rule
and
perhaps,
it
is
an
overstatement
but
certainly
i
do
not
believe
so.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
in
this
case,
the
board
is
trying
to
do
is
to
say
that
the
protection
of
the
labor
management
act
extends
not
just
to
labor
but
that
management
unless
it
is
in
a
labor
sense
deposition
in
labor
relations
or
excluded
by
a
particular
portion
of
the
call
like
supervisors,
that’s
one,
agriculture
workers
are
another,
that
management
is
free
to
organize
and
bargain
with
management
subject
to
those
exclusions
and
we
say
that’s
brand
new
and
we
say
that
if
that
is
what
they
want,
they’d
better
go
to
congress
to
get
it.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
i
just
because
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
just
thought
you
remind
me
if
you
would
because
certainly
in
a
brief
here
there
is
no
question
that
they
have
taken
the
position
that,
they
have
taken
the
position
in
the
brief
here
that
swift
is
an
aberration.
i
see
that
that
position
not
been
adopted
by
several
members
of
this
court
right
now
but
general
counsel
in
its
brief
in
the
eighth
circuit
took
no
such
position.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
in
north
arkansas,
i
cannot
tell
you
right
now
because
they
got
the
citation
and
it
does
not
say
first
or
second
appeal.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right,
well
it
will
be
between
67
and
70
and
this
is
general
counsel
writing
for
the
board,
while
the
act
makes
no
specific
provision
for
managerial
employees,
the
board
has
long
held
that
this
category
of
personnel
to
be
excluded
from
the
act.
now
that’s
general
counsel
from
the
board
itself
saying
this
category
of
employees
in
a
long
line
of
cases
has
held
to
be
excluded.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
i
suppose
they
are
equating
managerial
with
management
and
employer.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
prior
to
north
arkansas
for
that
long
line
as
general
counsel
said
they
are
considered
employer
and
now
they
want
to
change
it
all.
we
said
that
we
want
to
change
basic
coverage
of
the
act
in
its
fundamental
way.
introduce
a
new
concept
of
labor
negotiations,
management,
bargaining
with
non-labor
sense
of
management.
but
perhaps,
congress
ought
to
do
that
and
not
the
board
by
decision
which
two
circuit
courts
have
considered
and
disagreed
with.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
exactly,
particularly
where
cost-cutting
is
a
major
part
of
it.
i
should
mention
that
we
have
copies
of
the
amicus
brief.
we
have
not
filed
replies
or
to
those
briefs
but
the
uaw
brief
in
the
last
part
i
think
is
wrong
when
it
attempts
to
say
that
this
will
affect
or
exclude
people
now
already
covered
as
technical
or
professional
people.
nothing
in
this
case
bears
on
that.
whatever
coverage
is
for
the
professional
or
technical
people
is
not
touched
by
this
appeal.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
mr.
richard
moot
from
buffalo.
we
represent
the
bell
aerospace
company,
a
division
of
textron.
our
firm
has
represented
this
company
and
its
predecessor
the
old
bell
aircraft
company
for
great
many
years.
my
partner,
now
deceased,
mr.
winch
handled
the
original
proceedings
before
the
epic
time
of
the
hearing.
i
would
like
at
the
beginning
just
to
mention
the
facts
briefly
where
we
believe
the
statement
of
facts
is
somewhat
lacking
and
then
to
give
you
the
points
which
i
will
make
here
this
afternoon
which
are
very
brief.
the
buyers
in
this
case
who
petitioned
to
be
represented
under
the
labor
management
relation
act
were
25
in
number.
the
job
description
called
for
preferred
or
senior
buyer
and
that
was
the
largest
number
of
them
of
a
college
education
with
a
business
administration
specially.
now
it’s
true
that
many
of
them
did
not
have
them
and
that
was
not
covered
at
the
hearing
but
six
years,
practical
experience
was
considered
a
substitute
for
it.
in
this
case,
the
buyers
and
may
i
just
say
that
our
business
was
not
either
burning
fuel
oil
or
burning
out
electric
light
bulbs
as
the
brief
might
suggest.
we
are
contractor,
very
heavily
in
research
and
development
and
70%
of
our
business
is
the
guidance
package,
propulsion
package
for
the
minute
man
missile.
a
large
part
of
which
is
tailor
made,
the
most
exact
specifications.
the
buyers
in
this
case
had
the
prime
responsibility,
two-fold
of
seeing
a
steady
flow
of
a
necessary
material,
special
tools
and
components
came
to
the
plant
at
belt
so
that
the
production
schedule
for
our
missile
man
would
stay
on
line.
second,
they
had
the
responsibility
to
see
that
this
was
done
with
the
maximum
economy
of
the
company,
their
employer’s
money.
one
buyer,
senior
buyer
in
this
case
in
the
19th-month
period
which
we
are
talking
about,
spent
$1,300,000.00
as
on
an
issue
taking
collectively
the
amount
that
he
purchased
on
his
own
say
so
alone,
the
group
in
total.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
19
months.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
in
19
months
period
the
group
of
25
together
spent
$7,600,000.00
on
their
own
initiative.
collectively,
they
participated
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
but
on
their
signature.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
collectively
in
the
same
period,
the
group
of
25
supervised
or
participated
in
the
procurement
of
material
in
the
amount
of
$41,300,000.00.
now
i
say
those
facts
so
that
we’ll
not
be
mislead
in
talking
about
buyers
to
think
opening
up
the
catalogue
to
see
this
rollback
and
saying,
“where
are
they
going
to
get
this
or
that
piece
of
pottery
to
stock
the
shelf?”
we
are
not
talking
about
light
bulbs,
fuel
oil,
packing
paper
or
shelf
items
which
are
constantly
being
mentioned
in
the
opposing
brief.
if
best,
that
is
now
i
will
be
quite
frank
an
attempt
to
mislead
the
court
as
to
the
nature
of
the
duties
here.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
we
are
talking,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
are
talking
about
special
components
for
minute
man
missile.
highly
complex
electronic
devices,
in
many
cases
it
is
cheaper
for
our
client
bell
to
buy
say
a
black
box
from
minneapolis
honeywell
than
would
be
to
ask
the
people
in
the
plant
to
make
it.
wherever
they
are
asking
for
a
guiding
system
or
any
part
of
a
guiding
system
or
an
intricate
valve,
no,
one
of
the
control
valves
for
minute
man.
if
that
can
be
made
more
cheaply
and
better
outside
the
plant,
then
that’s
the
buyers
job,
to
find
somebody
who
can
do
it
and
have
it
built
outside
the
plant
and
brought
in
and
in
the
appendix
into
the
record
here.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
act
on
their
own
initiative.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
are
not
being
exempt
as
supervisors.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right.
they
are
acting
as
a
part
of
management
and
in
this,
buyers
act
as
a
team.
they
include
engineering,
quality
control,
financial
and
the
buyers
himself
acts
as
captain
of
that
team
but
he
does
not
perform
his
job
at
the
desk
at
the
bell
plant.
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
visit
the
various
sub-contractors
or
parties
where
the
material,
special
tools
or
special
components
is
either
being
designed
or
being
built.
he
has
responsibilities
to
see
that
the
production
dates
and
schedules
are
maintained.
if
a
strike
occurs
at
this
supplier’s
plant,
any
dollar
amount
is
under
$5,000.00
he
can
cancel
it
at
the
strike
of
the
plant
and
put
it
in
a
non-union
plant
in
order
to
ensure
the
orderly
flow
of
necessary
components
to
the
assembly
of
the
minute
man
missile.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
have
it
as
the
proof
shows
here,
the
authority
to
decide
to
make
or
buy.
they
also
have
the
authority
under
$5,000.00
to
change
from
the
recommended
source
if
some
department
in
bell
recommends
a
given
source.
they
can
change
that

if

they
can
make
an
investigation
and
report
and
it
goes
up
the
ladder.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
but
again
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
make
a
recommendation.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
make
a
recommendation
and
after
the
recommendation
is
reviewed
but
i
am
sure
your
honor
will
know
that
where
the
work
has
been
carefully
done
at
that
level.
the
question
on
review
is,
is
it
documented?
is
the
satisfactory
piece
of
work
but
the
knowledge
and
the
specialty
and
the
know
how
to
make
an
intelligent
recommendation
there
rests
with
the
bar
and
the
overwhelming
case
is
the
proof
in
this
record
shows
if
he
is
sustained
on
review.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
he
is
--
yes
there
is
and
this
is
why
he
is
part
of
management.
his
limitation
is
he
must
select
the
supplier
which
is
going
to
do
it
most
economically
for
the
company
and
in
the
record
here.
about
15
pages
of
cost
reductions
achieved
by
selecting
a
buyer
sometimes
other
than
the
one
designated
because
they
could
get
a
better
price.
he
has
a
characteristic
function
of
management
to
try
and
conduct
the
business
of
the
company
in
a
more
economical
manner
but
he
has
no
restrictions
on
whether
he
should
buy
union
or
non-union
and
if
he
thinks
he
can
get
a
better
price
in
non-union,
he
buys
a
non-union.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
there
are
regulations
with
respect
to
or
guides
that
people
have
used
before
and
people
have
been
approved
by
the
department
of
defense
and
other
guidelines,
yes
there
are.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
think
he
has
the
right
to
go
off
the
list
too
in
certain
cases.
now,
if
i
my
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
think
and
again
this
was
not
detailed
name
by
name
in
the
proof
that
i
read
the
record.
they
experienced
in
this
case
was
predominantly
learned
on
the
job.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell
that’s
--
i
was
hopeful
i
can
get
to
that
before
more
of
my
time
was
gone.
that
is
certainly
true
and
the
point
i
want
to
make
and
i
have
only
made
this
one
point
this
afternoon,
i
believe
i
will
serve
my
client
well.
the
rule
that
is
being
espoused
in
this
case
is
new
and
makes
no
mistake
about
it.
the
position
that
mr.
judge
friendly
below
is
very
simple,
he
said,
“where
there
is
a
well
established
rule
as
what
is
management
and
what
is
not
the
management,
you
stick
by
the
rule
unless
if
you
are
going
either
rulemaking
or
back
to
the
congress.”
now
let
me
just
make
this
point.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
did
and
let
me
just
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
the
point
exactly
i
am
making
is
that
north
arkansas
is
a
new
rule
and
north
arkansas
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
exactly
and
the
claim
made
in
brief
here
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
but
this
proceeding
began
in
1970
and
at
the
time
this
hearing
was
conducted,
north
arkansas
had
not
been
decided,
as
a
matter
of
struck
--
fact
by
strange
coincidence,
the
decision
was
dated
in
north
arkansas
august
27,
1970
and
the
hearing
officer
began
proof
in
this
case
august
28,
1970.
and
if
i
just
brief
a
short
departmental
record
to
make
how
clear
it
is
that
this
conflict
of
interest
rule
which
they
now
say
they
have
all
along.
the
claim
in
brief
here
is,
that
swift
is
an
aberration
and
at
from
the
time
of
1947,
the
taft-hartley
amendment
and
the
overturning
of
practice
that
all
along
they
have
excluded
or
excuse
me,
they
have
said
managerial
employees
are
only
excluded
if
they
are
in
labor
relations
or
if
they
present
a
potential
conflict
of
interest
or
statutory,
i
think
as
mr.
justice
white
points
out
exclusion
like
supervisors.
and
we
say
that
this
simply
is
not
so,
the
conflict
of
interest
rule
is
just
as
new
as
the
north
arkansas.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes
and
what
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
where
justice
friendly
below
and
general
counsel
for
are
the
board
have
parted
company
its
position.
judge
friendly
below
that
where
a
long
line
of
cases
from
1947
up
to
1970
have
said
that
buyers
who
spend
significant
amounts
of
the
company’s
money
with
significant
independent
discretion
have
been
considered
a
part
of
management
and
not
covered
by
the
act
and
we
are
in
a
long
line
of
cases
such
as
that
is
well
established
and
you
wish
to
change
it.
we
should
adopt
rulemaking
otherwise
it
leads
to
practitioner
and
we
certainly
don’t
adopt
the
view
the
american
bar
association
or
any
one
else
that
we
want
to
have
a
new
rule
as
to
what
is
management
and
to
what
is
labor
produced
by
this
case
or
any
other
case.
if
we
are
going
to
make
a
change
and
how
they
decided
this
cases
from
1947
up
to
1970
which
is
the
date
of
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
no,
let
me
just
point
that
out.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
quite
understandably
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
don’t
read
the
slip
opinion
from
the
national
labors
relations
board
on
a
24-hour
basis.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
i
am
going
to
read
that
right
from
the
record.
i
am
pleased
to
have
your
question.
the
hearing
officer
says
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
page
8.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
hearing
officer
asks
my
associate
or
my
partner
mr.
winch,
“briefly
what
is
the
position
of
the
company?”
and
mr.
winch
replies
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
page
8.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
no,
nor
mr.
justice
brennan,
was
the
matter
of
conflict
of
interest,
the
very
thing
which
in
brief
now
they
say
must
be
determined
factual
questions
to
be
determined
was
not
even
mentioned.
there
was
no
argument
with
respect
to
conflict
of
interest
at
the
time
of
approval.
the
first
time
conflict
of
interest
entered
this
case.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
when
i
got
to
the
board,
the
board
conceded
that
these
were
managerial
employees
and
a
part
of
management
but
they
said
we
have
the
right.
that
will
be
by
next
question.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
north
arkansas.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
they
did
and
they
said
by
brief,
if
i
can
read
again.
now
this
is
positioned
directly
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
brief
in
this
court
which
we
find
somewhat
embarrassing.
they
said,
“while
the
board’s
decision
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
what’s
that?
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
am
on
the
brief
for
the
board
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well,
i
believe
it
is
filed
with
the
court
but
i
am
not
sure
it’s
in
front
of
you
but
we
also
put
it
in
our
brief,
and
they
say,
“while
the
board’s
decision
in
north
arkansas
and
the
instant
case
marked
a
change
in
board
policy,
it
is
well
settled
that
the
board
may
change
its
policy
if
in
doing
so
it
does
not
act
arbitrarily.”
now
this
is
where
judge
friendly
said,
“if
you
are
going
to
change
and
say,
what
is
always
been
a
part
of
management
and
say
that’s
not
management
or
say
if
you
will,
that
management
has
the
right
to
organize
and
bargain
under
the
act
with
management
if
you
cannot
show
that
it
is
labor
sensitive
or
in
a
conflict
of
interest.”
judge
friendly
and
the
eighthh
circuit
both
read
the
legislative
history
to
say
that
that’s
absolutely
off,
that
when
congress
originally
passed
the
act;
it
was
designed
in
answer
to
your
other
question
mr.
justice
white,
to
provide
a
set
of
ground
rules
for
management
to
bargain
with
labor.
it
was
never
intended
that
management
would
bargain
with
non-labor
sensitive
management
and
that
was
the
position
that
mr.
judge
friendly
took
and
he
said,
“if
you
want
to
establish
a
rule
now
that
managerial
employees,
part
of
management
have
the
right
to
organize
and
bargain
with
other
management
if
they
are
outside
the
labor
relations
department
or
if
they
are
not
in
a
conflict
of
interest
situation,
you
go
back
to
congress
with
that
argument.”
but
he
said,
“if
what
you
are
trying
to
say
is
that
buyers
whom
for
this
whole
period
from
1947
to
1970,
on
similar
facts
situations,
without
exceptions
during
that
period,
the
board
had
treated
as
they
did
on
swift
and
american
locomotive
and
treated
those
type
of
employees
as
a
part
of
management
and
said
that
they
were
outside
that.
he
said,
now
if
you
want
to
save
buyers
who
are
not
really
part
of
management,
you
want
to
change
your
mind
that
you
should
go
through
rulemaking
to
do
that
and
we
think
that
that
rule
is
eminently
sensible
one.
but
if
they
want
to
establish
two
categories
of
management
and
have
management
bargained
with
management
that
is
for
congress.
if
you
want
to
change
a
well
established
definition
as
to
what
is
part
of
management,
buyers
under
factual
situations
similar
to
what
we
have
here.
we
should
do
that
with
rulemaking.
i
think
the
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
in
part.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
think
it
was
based
upon
the
original
approach
and
handling
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
when
it
was
first
passed.
that
the
national
relations
act
went
first
passed
did
not
attempt
to
define
what
was
management
in
all
inclusive
terms.
it
was
assumed
that
if
it
was
management,
it
was
on
one
side
and
labor
was
on
the
other
side
and
the
first
major
dispute
over
that
arose
in
packard
and
where
in
packard
they
said
that
foreman
are
not
a
part
of
management
and
they
are
covered.
congress
quickly
corrected
that
and
said
they
should
not
be
--
they
should
be
excluded
from
the
act
and
that
was
done
but
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
had
certainly
throughout
its
whole
history
hold
purposes
to
provide
a
system
of
ground
rules
between
management
on
one
side
and
labor
on
the
other
and
no
attempt,
i
don’t
believe
mr.
justice
white
was
ever
made
to
say
the
following
shall
constitute
management
and
the
following
shall
constitute
labor.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
certainly
that
was
what
the
eighthh
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
did.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
after
a
long
period
of
time
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
did
considering
the
number
of
years.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes
it
is
and
all
i
can
say
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white
is
that
we
agree
with
the
legislative
history
arguments
in
both
the
eighthh
circuit
and
the
second
circuit.
but
the
point
which
is
i
am
trying
to
make,
and
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
here
is
that
when
they
came
to
north
arkansas
they
changed
the
rules
and
that
swift
is
not
as
they
now
claim
an
aberration
that
the
rule
was
well
established
from
1947,
time
of
taft-hartley
act
to
1950.
let
me
just
read
from
general
counsel’s
brief
in
the
north
arkansas
case.
now
this
is
general
counsel
from
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
i
understand
that
and
all
i
can
say
in
a
time
allotted
here
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
of
the
two,
i
think
that
both
the
eighth
circuit
and
second
circuit.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
were
correct
mr.
richard
e.
moot
and
i
think
that
they
have
given
full
weighth
to
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
expect
that
is
true
but
i
think
that
where
in
attempting
to
get
around
this
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
that
is
and
i
think
that
the
operations
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
i
certainly
are
in
mr.
judge
friendly’s
corner
on
that.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
they
were
primarily
charged
with
economy
and
management
of
the
company
and
its
fund
and
their
exempt.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well,
what
we’re
saying
is
that
where
such
a
major
departure
is
going
to
be
made
from
a
well
established
line
of
cases
that
it
is
either
for
congress
which
is
amended
it
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
overturning
fact
or
it
is
for
rulemaking.
that’s
our
position
but
i
think
the
reason
why
in
this
court
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
i
think,
quite
honestly
if
you
are
going,
to
me,
the
argument
that
is
appealing
to
me
is
the
lawyer
is
if
you
are
going
to
change
what
you
have
always
considered
to
be
management.
although
it
is
going
to
change
the
jurisdictional
ground
of
this
statute
but
that’s
something
congress
ought
to
be
doing
and
we
ought
not
to
be
doing
it
on
a
single
case.
that
is
more
appealing
to
me
that
this
is
for
the
legislature
not
the
courts.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well,
that’s
the
very
advice
here
and
the
leap
happens
to
come
after
we
have
the
hearing,
after
the
very
factual
issue
which
is
supposed
to
be
determined
on
each
case
is
over.
we
never
got
the
conflict
of
interest
because
it
was
not
the
law.
mr.
winch
had
practiced
in
his
field
for
40
years.
he
never
heard
of
it,
the
hearing
officer
had
not
heard
of
it
and
uaw
representative
have
not
heard
of
this
rule.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
none
whatsoever
mr.
justice
powell.
it’s
that
new
and
the
idea
that
swift
is
an
aberration
which
is
being
urged
to
find
your
honor
by
the
pre-period
it
is
absolutely
false.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
it
was
not
argued
before
the
board?
mr.
richard
e.
moot
we
asked
to
reconsider
it,
the
eighth
circuit
does
not
agree
with
it.
they
said,
“we
do
not
have
to
reconsider,
we
were
right
in
the
first
place.”
now
we
got
two
seconds
--
two
circuit
courts
which
say
this
is
management
and
it’s
not
covered.
we
said
we
don’t
care,
we’ll
still
persist
for
this
rule
and
the
pragmatics
of
applying
conflict
of
interest
just
opened
a
whole
host
of
grounds.
i
will
leave
it
there
because
i
see
i
only
have
few
minutes.
i
do
not
think
and
i
agree
with
mr.
chief
justice,
the
test
of
conflict
of
interest
must
be
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
apply
because
if
the
fact
and
circumstances
change,
whether
articulate
part
of
management
is
in
a
conflict
of
interest
will
change.
people
may
be
in
one
time
and
out
another,
an
example
from
our
own
very
own
company.
decision
is
made
from
a
corporate
point
of
view,
to
take
the
principal
production
from
wheatfield
and
move
it
to
texas
and
labor
costs
were
a
significant
part
of
that.
it
had
a
very
stormy
production.
labor
negotiation
history
neither
peninsula.
many
people
would
have
to
participate
on
that
move
from
wheatfield
to
texas.
once
made,
the
same
people
might
have
no
labor
sensitive
input
whatsoever
in
the
management
but
they
might
be
highly
labor
sensitive
or
in
a
position
of
conflict
of
interest
while
that
decision
of
opening
a
separate
plant
in
the
south
was
before
that
came
afterwards,
they
wouldn’t
be.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
that’s
what
they
thought.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
he
thought
north
arkansas
was
wrong
and
secondly
said
you
couldn’t
tell
which
way
they
have
decided.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right
and
you
can’t
tell
that
he
is
starring
this
record
which
way
they
decided
it.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
well
i
said
that.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
to
this
extent
that
they
conceded
that
the
buyers
were
managerial
both
in
brief
and
by
argument,
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
tell
that
they
apparently
made
that
concession
but
as
judge
friendly
said
when
i
argued
the
case
in
front
of
him.
in
fact
the
board’s
conceded
it
does
not
mean
that
it
is
so.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
it’s
true
and
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
make
evidence
on
potential
conflict
of
interest
because
the
real
conflict
of
interest
often
does
not
develop
until
you
organize
a
part
of
management.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
in
two
days
or
i
think
it
began
at
28th
at
the
month
of
september
the
third
so
maybe
a
weeks
time
altogether.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
no
they
didn’t
but
we
did
that
and
put
it
in
the
addendum
of
our
brief
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
it’s
true.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes
but
the
decision
was
on
our
side
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes
but
--
we
were
on
a
representation
case
and
the
eighth
circuit
had
made
it
clear
that
a
managerial
employee
of
the
type
in
north
arkansas
did
not
qualify
for
representation
as
well
their
first
decision.
and
so
we’re
quite
correct
in
saying
conflict
of
interest
is
not
approvable
matter
in
this
hearing
because
it
never
have
been
before
and
the
eighth
circuits
said
it
should
not
be.
and
so
the
here
hearing
officer,
the
uaw
representative
or
mr.
winch
who
has
spent
40
years
in
this
field
attempted
proof
of
because
it
wasn’t
proper.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
but
i
am
happy
to
answer
any
more
questions
but
i
believe
if
i
made
my
one
point
and
made
it
to
the
best
of
my
ability
that
they
are
espousing
a
new
rule
and
perhaps,
it
is
an
overstatement
but
certainly
i
do
not
believe
so.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
in
this
case,
the
board
is
trying
to
do
is
to
say
that
the
protection
of
the
labor
management
act
extends
not
just
to
labor
but
that
management
unless
it
is
in
a
labor
sense
deposition
in
labor
relations
or
excluded
by
a
particular
portion
of
the
call
like
supervisors,
that’s
one,
agriculture
workers
are
another,
that
management
is
free
to
organize
and
bargain
with
management
subject
to
those
exclusions
and
we
say
that’s
brand
new
and
we
say
that
if
that
is
what
they
want,
they’d
better
go
to
congress
to
get
it.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
i
just
because
--
mr.
richard
e.
moot
i
just
thought
you
remind
me
if
you
would
because
certainly
in
a
brief
here
there
is
no
question
that
they
have
taken
the
position
that,
they
have
taken
the
position
in
the
brief
here
that
swift
is
an
aberration.
i
see
that
that
position
not
been
adopted
by
several
members
of
this
court
right
now
but
general
counsel
in
its
brief
in
the
eighth
circuit
took
no
such
position.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
in
north
arkansas,
i
cannot
tell
you
right
now
because
they
got
the
citation
and
it
does
not
say
first
or
second
appeal.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right,
well
it
will
be
between
67
and
70
and
this
is
general
counsel
writing
for
the
board,
while
the
act
makes
no
specific
provision
for
managerial
employees,
the
board
has
long
held
that
this
category
of
personnel
to
be
excluded
from
the
act.
now
that’s
general
counsel
from
the
board
itself
saying
this
category
of
employees
in
a
long
line
of
cases
has
held
to
be
excluded.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
yes,
i
suppose
they
are
equating
managerial
with
management
and
employer.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
that’s
right.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
prior
to
north
arkansas
for
that
long
line
as
general
counsel
said
they
are
considered
employer
and
now
they
want
to
change
it
all.
we
said
that
we
want
to
change
basic
coverage
of
the
act
in
its
fundamental
way.
introduce
a
new
concept
of
labor
negotiations,
management,
bargaining
with
non-labor
sense
of
management.
but
perhaps,
congress
ought
to
do
that
and
not
the
board
by
decision
which
two
circuit
courts
have
considered
and
disagreed
with.
mr.
richard
e.
moot
exactly,
particularly
where
cost-cutting
is
a
major
part
of
it.
i
should
mention
that
we
have
copies
of
the
amicus
brief.
we
have
not
filed
replies
or
to
those
briefs
but
the
uaw
brief
in
the
last
part
i
think
is
wrong
when
it
attempts
to
say
that
this
will
affect
or
exclude
people
now
already
covered
as
technical
or
professional
people.
nothing
in
this
case
bears
on
that.
whatever
coverage
is
for
the
professional
or
technical
people
is
not
touched
by
this
appeal.
