unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
i
am
perhaps
substantially
confused,
does
the
record
show
the
amount
of
the
settlement
mid-gulf
made?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
the
record
doesn't
show
how
much
in
fact
the
vessel
has
paid
the
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
judgment
the
plaintiff
got?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
been
paid?
unknown
speaker
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
who
represent
the
insurer?
unknown
speaker
for
mid-gulf?
unknown
speaker
the
vessel
has
paid
nothing?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed,
who
pays
what
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
texas
employer
as
being
mid-gulf's
insurer.
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
a
--
so
nobody
is
going
to
have
a
wind
fall.
mid-gulf
simply
gets
back
half
of
what
is
paid.
unknown
speaker
all
right
--
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
below,
then
cooper
pays
--
cooper
pays
half
and
the
vessel
pays
half.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
the
mid-gulf
--
do
i
understand
that
did
you
tell
us
yesterday
that
the
mid-gulf
had
an
indemnity
agreement
with
the
vessel?
unknown
speaker
before
we
move
on,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
the
respondent's
brief
disputes
your
assertion
that
there
has
already
been
full
indemnification,
was
that
issue
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
--
undisputed
to
what
the
facts
are?
unknown
speaker
that
there
was
indemnification?
unknown
speaker
in
full?
unknown
speaker
is
the
record
clear
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
is
that
so
in
the
maritime
field,
i
mean
the
existing
law
of
contribution
was
--
unknown
speaker
but
your
opponents
have
urged
that
halcyon
has
never
been
applied
broadly
to
just
all
non-collision
cases
that
it
only
had
a
narrow
application
that
courts
of
appeals
have
not
followed
and
have
not
applied
it
so
broadly.
i
know
the
fifth
circuit
hasn't,
how
about
the
other
circuits?--
unknown
speaker
well,
it
didn't
disregard
the
application
of
halcyon
into
the
facts
very
similar
to
halcyon.
unknown
speaker
very
dangerous
here.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
the
right
to
contribution.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
congress
legislated
against
the
background
of
halcyon
and
on
the
assumption
that
halcyon
applies
to
non-collision
cases.
but
when
congress
finally
acted,
changes
the
rules
in
this
area,
haven't
the
fifth
circuit
already
departed
on
its
own
course?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
second
circuit
case?
unknown
speaker
now,
here
were
two
major
maritime
circuits
that
were
construing
halcyon
not
to
cover
certain
kinds
of
non-collision
cases.
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
about
that
but
that
in
terms
of
what
congress
intends
to
do.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
our
claim,
you
mean
now,
the
ship?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
now
the
ship.
unknown
speaker
having
stepped
in
the
shoes
--
stepped
in
the
shoes
of
the
ship,
has
been
on
the
ship,
and
we
do
not
have
to
pay
off
any
money
but
--
but
your
client
is
really
mid-gulf?
unknown
speaker
mid-gulf
is
out
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
by
the
time
again
of
the
trial
was
it
tripartite
case.
unknown
speaker
there
had
been
four
parties,
now
there
are
three.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
injured
stevedore,
the
injured
--
unknown
speaker
longshoreman,
and
the
injured
was
longshoreman
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
vessel
and
cooper
stevedoring
and
those
are
the
only
three,
and
now
the
injured
man
is
out.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
asked
for
it
and
the
court
didn't
give
it
to
you.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
pretty
direct
answer,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
how
much
was
full
indemnity
have
been?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
gave
you
how
much?
unknown
speaker
and
half
of
it
is?
unknown
speaker
how
about
attorney's
fees?
unknown
speaker
you
got
half.
unknown
speaker
who
did
indemnities?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
there
is
none
left.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
comparative?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
i
am
perhaps
substantially

does
the

of
the
