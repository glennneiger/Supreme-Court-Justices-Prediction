mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
admiralty
case
brought
before
the
court
on
grant
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
broad
issue
posed
by
the
case
concerns
the
right
of
contribution
in
admiralty
between
joint
tortfeasors.
before
we
reach
and
discuss
that
broad
issue,
i
think
it
behooves
us
first
to
examine
in
some
detail,
the
particular
factual
and
procedural
context
in
which
this
case
is
presented
to
the
court.
the
story
of
the
case
is
where
it
begins
in
mobile,
alabama,
where
my
client,
cooper
stevedoring
company
loaded
a
cargo
of
palletized
crated
fire
brick
aboard
the
vessel.
the
evidence
shows
that,
that
loading
was
done
under
the
supervision
of
the
chief
officer
of
the
vessel
and
the
supercargo,
an
employee
of
the
time
charter.
upon
completion
of
the
discharge,
the
stowage
performed
by
my
client
was
inspected
and
approved
by
the
vessel.
the
cargo,
the
evidence
showed
was
not
secured
at
mobile
in
any
way
to
prevent
it
from
shifting
at
sea
nor
was
it
covered
with
dunnage.
the
ship
sailed
and
went
to
houston,
there
the
plaintiff,
mr.
troy
sessions,
who
was
one
of
the
first
longshoremen
to
work
on
top
of
the
mobile
stowed
cargo,
he
was
carrying
a
sack
of
cargo
and
he
stepped
on
a
piece
of
paper,
which
obscured
a
crack
between
the
crates,
which
had
been
loaded
in
mobile.
his
foot
went
into
the
crack
and
he
sustained
a
back
injury.
as
a
result,
he
first
of
course
drew
a
compensation
benefits,
under
the
united
states
longshoremen’s
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act.
in
connection
therewith,
he
also
brought
an
action
against
the
vessel
owner.
the
vessel
then
filed
a
rather
standard
ryan
indemnity
action
against
both
mr.
sessions’
employer,
mid-gulf
stevedores
in
houston
and
against
my
client,
cooper
stevedore
in
mobile.
it’s
important
to
notice
two
things
at
this
point.
first,
that
mr.
sessions
did
not
sue
my
client,
cooper,
directly,
although
there
was
no
statutory
bar
to
his
having
done
so.
secondly,
the
indemnity
action
asserted
by
the
ship
against
both
mid-gulf
and
cooper
was
an
action
purely
for
breach
of
warrant.
it
was
not
an
action
seeking
contribution.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
yes,
mr.--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
not
against
mid-gulf,
that
such
an
action
was
expressly
prohibited,
by
the
1972
amendment,
but
the
ryan
action
against
my
client
would
still
survive
[voice
overlap]
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
those
amendments
--
we’d
merely
say
that
mr.
sessions
no
longer
has
a
right
to
recover
against
the
vessel
for
unseaworthiness.
he
must
prove
negligence,
but
having
proved
negligence
that
the
vessel
would
still
be
free
to
prosecute
either
in
that
action
or
in
a
separate
case
an
action
for
indemnity
against
cooper.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
no,
the
jones
act
gives
a
right
of
recovery
for
employees
of
[voice
overlap]
seamen.
this
man
is
not
a
seaman.
he
is
a
so-called
sieracki
seaman,
quasi-seaman,
which
until
the
1972
amendment,
he
had
the
benefit
of
the
warranty
of
unseaworthiness,
which
is
always
has
been
applied
to
seamen.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
only
an
action
for
negligence
against
--
that’s
his
sole
action
against
the
vessel.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
no,
because
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
crew.
shortly,
before
the
trial
of
the
case,
mid-gulf,
the
houston
stevedores,
took
over
the
defense
of
the
vessel
and
in
so
doing,
he
agreed
to
indemnify
the
vessel
fully.
now,
at
this
point
he’s
been
challenged
in
respondent’s
brief,
they
have
asserted
that
no
place
does
this
appear
of
record.
i
would
cite
the
court
to
page
118
of
the
appendix,
where
mr.
smith
testified
concerning
this.
the
district
court
made
a
specific
fact-finding
on
page
164,
if
there’s
any
question
about
it,
on
the
final
page
of
the
brief,
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit,
on
behalf
of
the
vessel.
if
this
circuit
has
a
local
rule
of
13
(a)
which
requires
a
recusal
statement,
in
order
for
the
court
to
evaluate
possible
disqualification
of
the
circuit
requires
each
counsel
to
state
who
the
real
party
in
interest
in
the
case
is.
that
recusal
statement
says,
texas
employers
insurance
association,
which
the
record
shows
is
mid-gulf,
insurer.
texas
employers
insurance
association
is
obligated
by
a
contract
of
indemnity
to
pay
any
final
judgment,
which
may
be
rendered
against
the
appellees
and
cross-appellants
in
this
case,
the
appellees
and
cross-appellants
in
the
fifth
circuit,
of
course
there
being
the
vessel.
upon
conclusion
of
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
district
court
made
these
findings.
the
vessel
was
found
unseaworthy
and
the
vessel
owner
negligent
in
three
respects,
first
in
the
failure
to
secure
the
crates
in
mobile.
secondly,
in
failure
to
dunnage
off
the
cargo,
and
thirdly,
because
of
the
presence
of
this
piece
of
paper,
which
obscured
the
dangerous
condition.
the
district
court
also
found
that
cooper
was
negligent
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
dunnage
off
and
the
failure
to
secure.
now,
i
think
it’s
important
at
this
point
to
carefully
examine
the
precise
legal
significance
of
those
findings.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
when
the
argument
was
interrupted,
we
were
discussing
the
specific
district
court
findings.
it
will
be
recalled
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
vessel
was
on
sea,
and
vessel
owner
negligent
in
three
respects:
in
failing
to
secure
the
cargo
in
mobile,
in
failing
to
dunnage
off
the
cargo
in
mobile,
and
because
of
the
presence
of
the
piece
of
the
paper
covering
the
crack
which
was
the
immediate
cause
of
the
plaintiff's
injury.
the
district
court
also
found
that
cooper
was
negligent
in
two
respects
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
secure
and
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
dunnage
off
in
mobile.
now,
the
precise
legal
significance
of
these
findings
has
to
be
rather
carefully
scrutinized.
first
of
all,
it's
to
be
noted
that
there
is
no
finding
of
joint
liability
of
the
ship
and
cooper
to
the
plaintiff.
there
is
no
finding
of
joint
liability
because
the
plaintiff,
if
it
will
be
recalled,
did
not
sue
cooper.
now,
the
significance
of
this
is
that
since
the
plaintiff
did
not
sue
cooper,
there
is
thus
no
and
i
am
quoting
here
from
respondent's
brief,
“no
common
liability
for
concurrent
fault”
which
is,'
and
again
i
am
to
use
the
words
of
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
25
which
is
the
'sine
qua
non
of
contribution'.
that
is,
there
is
no
joint
liability
because
the
plaintiff
didn't
sue
cooper.
the
second
significance
of
the
district
court's
findings
is
that
cooper
negligence
was
found
to
be
negligence
vis-à-vis
the
plaintiff.
that
is
the
acts
which
cooper
did.
the
failing
to
secure
and
the
failing
to
done
a
job
were
found
on
a
careful
examination
of
the
district
court's
findings
at
a
163
and
164
of
the
appendix
are
found
to
be
negligence
because
of
--
this
created
a
risk
of
harm
to
the
plaintiff
and
subsequent
longshoreman.
but
these
findings
are
legally
immaterial
because
again
the
plaintiff
for
tactical
considerations
did
not
sue
cooper.
the
third
legal
significance
to
these
findings
is
that
under
these
findings
and
under
the
undisputed
fact,
there
is
not
found
to
be
any
breach
of
duty
by
cooper
to
the
vessel.
because
the
two
things
cooper
was
faulted
for,
failing
to
secure
and
failing
to
dunnage
as
between
the
ship
and
cooper.
the
ultimate
decision
there
was
made
by
the
ship.
it
was
the
ship
that
decided
whether
or
not
to
dunnage.
if
the
ship
wanted
it
dunnaged,
the
evidence
shows
cooper
would
have
dunnage.
if
the
ship
wanted
the
cargo
secure,
cooper
would
have
been
happy
to
secure
the
cargo
for
of
course
an
additional
price.
but
those
decisions
were
decisions
of
the
ship.
thus,
regardless
of
this
court's
treatment
of
the
more
general
problem
before
the
court,
namely
the
right
of
contribution
between
joint
tortfeasors
in
admiralty,
there
are
two
very
specific
reasons
in
this
specific
case,
why
this
is
an
improper
case
for
contribution.
first
of
all,
because
as
we
have
seen
that
the
party
which
has
been
granted
contribution,
the
vessel
has
already
been
fully
indemnified.
it
was
fully
indemnified
by
mid-gulf
stevedores.
so
that
if
we
view
the
case
as
one
where
it
is
the
vessel
which
is
suing
cooper
for
contribution,
the
vessel's
cause
of
action
is
extinguished.
the
court
might
feel
but
why
it
isn't
the
real
party
at
interest
here
mid-gulf,
because
mid-gulf
has
stepped
into
the
shoes
of
the
vessel
and
it
has
taken
over
the
vessel's
defense.
but
if
that's
the
situation,
then
contribution
is
doubly
unfair
because
if
the
plaintiff
--
let
us
change
this
situations
like,
had
the
plaintiff
sued
cooper
alone.
let's
assume
for
instance
the
ship
was
not
--
could
not
get
jurisdiction
over
the
ship
but
the
vessel
owner
was
in
souvenir
something
of
that
sort.
so,
the
plaintiff
sues
only
cooper.
cooper
even
under
the
rule
urged
by
the
respondent
would
not
be
able
to
get
contribution
from
mid-gulf
because
mid-gulf
is
statutorily
immune
from
direct
action
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
its
actual
loss
is
measured
by
the
liability
of
the
vessel
to
the
plaintiff
which
is
the
amount
of
the
judgment.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
suggestion
is
circular.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
indemnity
or
contribution'
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
well,
under
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
entire
liability
was
imposed
on
the
vessel.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
full
amount
of
the
judgment
is
assessed
against
the
vessel
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
and
then
the
vessel
is
entitled
to
contribution
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
from
cooper.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
50%.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
but
in
the
first
instance
before
we
reach
that
point
and
indeed
that
point
has
been
reached,
the
judgment
against
the
plaintiff
is
no
longer
in
the
case
and
the
plaintiff's
judgment
has
been
satisfied
and
has
been
satisfied
by
mid-gulf
as
the
refusal
statement
in
the
brief
of
the
fifth
circuit
says
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i'm
not
sure
this
issue
has
ever
been
confronted
in
maritime
law
but
in
this
instance,
mid-gulf
did
not
take
an
assignment
of
the
vessel's
action.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
well,
of
course
that's
correct,
but
of
course
that
assumes,
of
course,
in
the
first
instant
that
there
is
a
right
of
contribution
which
is
the
more
general
issue
in
the
case,
i
appreciate
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
record
shows
the
total
amount
of
the
judgment
and
the
refusal
statement
in
the
fifth
circuit
brief
says
that
texas
employers
is
obligated
by
a
contract
of
the
indemnity
to
pay
any
judgment
rendered
against
the
vessel,
so
that
they
are
obligated
by
indemnity
to
pay
that
full
judgment.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
only
indirectly,
the
record
shows
how
much
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i've
forgotten
the
exact
amount,
$38,000.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that
has
been
settled.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
by
texas
employers
insurance
associate.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
through
the
insurer
for
mid-gulf
stevedores.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
right.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
the
vessel
got
out
of
the
case
in
advance
of
the
trial
and
the
suit
is
prosecuted
only
in
the
name
of
the
vessel,
even
though
mid-gulf
did
not
take
an
assignment
of
the
vessel's
cause
of
action
whatever
that
cause
of
action
may
be.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
that
my
client
cooper
will
be
obligated
to
reimburse
the
vessel,
actually
texas
employers
for
one-half
of
what
texas
employers
has
paid.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
insurer.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
true
but
mid-gulf
would
never
even
under
the
rule
urge
that
respondents
would
not
be
able
to
have
done
that
directly
because
it
surely
can't
be
said
to
have
a
right
of
contribution
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
--
against
cooper
because
cooper
had
no
right
of
contribution.
(voice
overlap)
it
could
insist
and
surely
there
is
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
well,
the
vessel,
it
quotes,
the
fictional
vessel.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
in
advance
of
trial,
mid-gulf
took
over
the
defense
of
the
vessel
but
the
counsel
were
substituted.
let
us
move
to
the
more
general
issue.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
it
was
not
addressed
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
it
was
the
subject
of
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
fact
it
consumed,
i
think
the
greater
part
of
the
oral
argument,
and
i
think
both
--
it's
fair
to
say
both
counsel
were
somewhat
surprised
that
the
problem
was
not
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
i
think
we
are
in
agreement.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that
there
was
indemnification.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
record
is
clear.
mr.
smith
testified
at
that
matter
at
the
trial
of
the
case.
this
question,
the
question
i
am
urging,
the
point
i
am
urging,
this
point
was
raised
in
the
district
court
and
mr.
smith,
the
counsel,
appearing
of
record
for
the
vessel
who
had
previously
been
counseled
for
the
stevedores
was
called
as
a
witness
by
kopke
and
testified
these
matters.
it
appears
of
record
there
and
it
appears
of
record
in
the
refusal
statement
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit
brief.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
the
more
general
issue
involved
in
the
case
involves
the
right
of
contribution
in
admiralty
generally.
for
purposes
of
oral
argument,
i
would
like
to
suggest
and
i
see
my
time
is
running
short,
that
this
problem
be
approached
by
seeing
what
are
the
conceivable
rules
that
the
court
could
develop
here.
first
and
i
submit
that
the
existing
rule
is
that
the
law
draws
a
distinction
between
collision
cases
on
the
one
hand
and
non-collision
cases
on
the
other.
in
collision
cases,
there
is
a
right
of
contribution,
in
non-collision
cases,
there
is
no
right
of
contribution.
this
is
what
the
halcyon
decision
says.
this
was
expressly
reaffirmed
by
the
court
two
years
ago
in
the
atlantic
case.
that's
the
current
law.
the
law
is
urged
by
the
respondents
is
the
opposite
into
the
spectrum
as
embodied
by
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
and
in
its
earlier
decision
in
watz
against
zapata
which
is
that
there
is
a
right
of
contribution,
except
generally,
except
where
the
party
against
whom
contribution
is
sought
is
statutorily
immune.
i
would
suggest
that
there
may
well
be
middle
grounds
between
these
two
polar
positions.
the
middle
grounds
being
that
a
right
of
contribution
could
be
granted
in
all
instances
saved
where
the
parties,
the
relationship
was
governed
by
the
ryan
indemnity
doctrine.
alternatively,
a
right
of
contribution
could
be
granted
either
in
all
non-personal
injury
cases
or
in
all
non-harbor
workers
compensation
cases.
if
i
have
time,
i
would
like
to
discuss
possible
rationales
for
those
approaches.
the
first
approach,
that
is
the
existing
law,
the
halcyon
atlantic
approach
may
appear
at
first
blush
to
be
artificial
why
a
distinction
between
collision
and
non-collision
cases.
the
distinction
is
a
sound
one
and
that
is
that
collision
cases
which
are
perhaps
the
oldest
form
of
maritime
litigation
had
well
developed
rules
governing
these
situations
long
in
advance
of
any
legislative
activity
in
the
area.
these
rules
even
predate
the
19th
century
activity
of
this
court
in
the
field.
on
the
other
hand,
in
non-collision
cases
as
justice
black's
opinion
points
out
so
clearly
in
the
halcyon
case.
there
is
substantial
legislative
activity.
that
legislative
--
this
is
most
pervasive
in
personal
injury
is
somewhat
less
pervasive
elsewhere
but
is
notable
for
instance
in
cargo
damage
cases.
but
all
legislative
activity
in
the
field
has
always
stop
short
of
creating
a
right
of
contribution.
traditionally,
contribution
can
only
be
created
by
the
legislatures.
indeed,
in
the
states
which
have
adopted
contribution,
it
has
almost
been
invariably
done
by
legislation
as
opposed
to
judicial
enactment.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
was
developed
judicially
but
it
was
developed
judicially
long
before
any
legislative
activity
generally,
in
the
fields
which
are
at
dispute
in
this
case.
in
those
areas,
the
legislation
has
never
enacted
contributions.
in
most
recently,
of
course,
the
rules
were
substantially
changed
in
1972
amendments.
those
amendments
to
the
compensation
act
were
enacted
against
the
backdrop
of
the
sieracki,
halcyon
and
ryan,
atlantic,
line
of
decisions.
they
were
carefully
tightened
to
meet
those
decisions
and
make
very
precise
adjustments
in
the
rights
of
plaintiff
versus
ship
versus
stevedoring.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
fifth
circuit
applied
it
broadly
until
the
late
60's
and
it
was
not
until
1972
that
the
second
circuit
went
along.
this
is
a
very
recent
phenomenon
where
lower
courts
have
felt
they
could
disregard
the
halcyon,
the
clear
language
of
halcyon,
all
during
the
50's
and
the
early
60's.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
if
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
didn't
know
the
perils
of
argument.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
should
hope.
the
disregarding
of
halcyon
is
a
recent
phenomenon.
and
i
do
not
think
it's
fair
to
restrict
halcyon
to
the
specific
facts
of
halcyon.
this
court
simply
cannot
just
brush
to
one
side,
the
whole
basis
for
halcyon
and
likewise
in
atlantic,
the
atlantic
case
was
a
totally
different
situation
because
they
are
the
party
against
the
contribution
--
was
not
statutorily
immune.
he
could
have
been
sued.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
there
--
i
cannot
recall
any
specific
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
halcyon
case
as
such.
there
are
many
references
to
ryan,
and
implicit
in
the
congress
is
considerations
is
that
it
was
ryan
which
was
the
law
which
governed
the
relationships
between
parties
and
that
there
was
either
all
the
way
indemnity
or
no
indemnity.
and
in
this
respect,
the
decision
--
a
decision
here
must
take
into
account
the
ryan
case
because
an
analysis
of
a
given
fact
situation
under
ryan
may
yield
radically
different
results
than
traditional
analysis
under
contribution
rule.
because
depending
on
the
facts
can
yield
inconsistent
results.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
yes,
that's
correct.
the
watz
case
had
been
decided,
this
case
had
not
been
decided.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
second
circuit
case
in
re
seaboard
shipping
had
been
decided
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
think
it's
perhaps
speculative
because
i
don't
recall
at
least
in
the
legislative
history
any
reference
to
watz
or
seaboard
shipping
and
i
don't
think
it
is
really
fair
for
us
to
conclude
one
way
or
another
about
the
matter.
the
rule
urged
by
the
respondents
would
represent,
we
submit
a
radical
change
in
the
law
of
maritime
law
and
it
would
be
an
ill
advise
change.
briefly,
it
would
work
to
the
disadvantage
of
plaintiffs,
it
would
discourage
settlements,
it
cannot
be
harmonized
with
ryan.
the
court
would
be
called
upon.
there
is
a
great
body
of
law
under
ryan
which
would
have
to
be
completely
rearranged
and
changed,
putting
a
substantial
burden
on
the
lower
courts
and
on
this
court.
there
are
middle
grounds
which
would
expand
contribution
slightly
but
these
middle
grounds
would
be
to
grant
contribution
in
all
the
cases,
say
those
governed
by
ryan
or
the
grand
contribution
in
all
but
personal
injury
cases,
or
in
all
but
cases
where
the
plaintiff
was
a
beneficiary
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
would
like
to
make
just
a
few
brief
points.
first,
the
merits
of
the
contribution
rule
are
at
best
arguable
and
they
are
certainly
appropriate
for
legislation
not
for
judicial
action.
this
is
the
common
law
tradition.
they
are
legislative
because
they
vitally
effect
amongst
others
the
rights
of
injured
plaintiffs.
if
there
is
one
category
of
people
mr.
justice
stewart
who
cannot
be
adjusted,
whose
rights
cannot
be
adjusted
by
insurance,
it
is
the
plaintiff
(voice
overlap)
plaintiff
and
as
professor
james
points
out,
a
rule
of
contributions
severely
restricts
the
plaintiff's
rights
about
one-third
of
the
state.
well,
first,
the
states
are
closely
divided
on
the
merits
of
legislation
and
i
refer
your
honors,
to
the
yale
law
review
article
which
analyses
the
different
state
rule.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
on
the
merits
of
contributions.
only
a
bare
majority,
even
half
contribution.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
right,
of
those
and
that
is
viewed
all
by
legislation
and
of
those
nearly
one-third
of
those
do
so
only
where
the
plaintiff
has
as
a
matter
of
tactics
chosen
to
sue
and
has
obtained
a
finding
against
both
defendants,
that
has
not
occurred
here.
so
this
court
would
be
doubly
asked
to
create
a
rule
which
would
work
against
injured
plaintiffs
in
an
area
of
the
law
where
this
court
has
been
especially
solicitous
of
the
rights
of
injured
plaintiff.
the
rules
of
contribution
in
the
states
also
frequently
do
not
equally
apportion
but
do
so
in
a
comparative
thought
basis.
a
separate
matter
is
that
the
issue
of
ryan
indemnity
in
this
case
is
not
before
this
court,
the
fifth
circuit
denied
it.
ryan
indemnity
had
no
cross
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
admiralty
case
brought
before
the
court
on
grant
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
broad
issue
posed
by
the
case
concerns
the
right
of
contribution
in
admiralty
between
joint
tortfeasors.
before
we
reach
and
discuss
that
broad
issue,
i
think
it
behooves
us
first
to
examine
in
some
detail,
the
particular
factual
and
procedural
context
in
which
this
case
is
presented
to
the
court.
the
story
of
the
case
is
where
it
begins
in
mobile,
alabama,
where
my
client,
cooper
stevedoring
company
loaded
a
cargo
of
palletized
crated
fire
brick
aboard
the
vessel.
the
evidence
shows
that,
that
loading
was
done
under
the
supervision
of
the
chief
officer
of
the
vessel
and
the
supercargo,
an
employee
of
the
time
charter.
upon
completion
of
the
discharge,
the
stowage
performed
by
my
client
was
inspected
and
approved
by
the
vessel.
the
cargo,
the
evidence
showed
was
not
secured
at
mobile
in
any
way
to
prevent
it
from
shifting
at
sea
nor
was
it
covered
with
dunnage.
the
ship
sailed
and
went
to
houston,
there
the
plaintiff,
mr.
troy
sessions,
who
was
one
of
the
first
longshoremen
to
work
on
top
of
the
mobile
stowed
cargo,
he
was
carrying
a
sack
of
cargo
and
he
stepped
on
a
piece
of
paper,
which
obscured
a
crack
between
the
crates,
which
had
been
loaded
in
mobile.
his
foot
went
into
the
crack
and
he
sustained
a
back
injury.
as
a
result,
he
first
of
course
drew
a
compensation
benefits,
under
the
united
states
longshoremen’s
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act.
in
connection
therewith,
he
also
brought
an
action
against
the
vessel
owner.
the
vessel
then
filed
a
rather
standard
ryan
indemnity
action
against
both
mr.
sessions’
employer,
mid-gulf
stevedores
in
houston
and
against
my
client,
cooper
stevedore
in
mobile.
it’s
important
to
notice
two
things
at
this
point.
first,
that
mr.
sessions
did
not
sue
my
client,
cooper,
directly,
although
there
was
no
statutory
bar
to
his
having
done
so.
secondly,
the
indemnity
action
asserted
by
the
ship
against
both
mid-gulf
and
cooper
was
an
action
purely
for
breach
of
warrant.
it
was
not
an
action
seeking
contribution.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
yes,
mr.--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
not
against
mid-gulf,
that
such
an
action
was
expressly
prohibited,
by
the
1972
amendment,
but
the
ryan
action
against
my
client
would
still
survive
[voice
overlap]
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
those
amendments
--
we’d
merely
say
that
mr.
sessions
no
longer
has
a
right
to
recover
against
the
vessel
for
unseaworthiness.
he
must
prove
negligence,
but
having
proved
negligence
that
the
vessel
would
still
be
free
to
prosecute
either
in
that
action
or
in
a
separate
case
an
action
for
indemnity
against
cooper.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
no,
the
jones
act
gives
a
right
of
recovery
for
employees
of
[voice
overlap]
seamen.
this
man
is
not
a
seaman.
he
is
a
so-called
sieracki
seaman,
quasi-seaman,
which
until
the
1972
amendment,
he
had
the
benefit
of
the
warranty
of
unseaworthiness,
which
is
always
has
been
applied
to
seamen.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
only
an
action
for
negligence
against
--
that’s
his
sole
action
against
the
vessel.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
no,
because
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
crew.
shortly,
before
the
trial
of
the
case,
mid-gulf,
the
houston
stevedores,
took
over
the
defense
of
the
vessel
and
in
so
doing,
he
agreed
to
indemnify
the
vessel
fully.
now,
at
this
point
he’s
been
challenged
in
respondent’s
brief,
they
have
asserted
that
no
place
does
this
appear
of
record.
i
would
cite
the
court
to
page
118
of
the
appendix,
where
mr.
smith
testified
concerning
this.
the
district
court
made
a
specific
fact-finding
on
page
164,
if
there’s
any
question
about
it,
on
the
final
page
of
the
brief,
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit,
on
behalf
of
the
vessel.
if
this
circuit
has
a
local
rule
of
13
(a)
which
requires
a
recusal
statement,
in
order
for
the
court
to
evaluate
possible
disqualification
of
the
circuit
requires
each
counsel
to
state
who
the
real
party
in
interest
in
the
case
is.
that
recusal
statement
says,
texas
employers
insurance
association,
which
the
record
shows
is
mid-gulf,
insurer.
texas
employers
insurance
association
is
obligated
by
a
contract
of
indemnity
to
pay
any
final
judgment,
which
may
be
rendered
against
the
appellees
and
cross-appellants
in
this
case,
the
appellees
and
cross-appellants
in
the
fifth
circuit,
of
course
there
being
the
vessel.
upon
conclusion
of
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
district
court
made
these
findings.
the
vessel
was
found
unseaworthy
and
the
vessel
owner
negligent
in
three
respects,
first
in
the
failure
to
secure
the
crates
in
mobile.
secondly,
in
failure
to
dunnage
off
the
cargo,
and
thirdly,
because
of
the
presence
of
this
piece
of
paper,
which
obscured
the
dangerous
condition.
the
district
court
also
found
that
cooper
was
negligent
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
dunnage
off
and
the
failure
to
secure.
now,
i
think
it’s
important
at
this
point
to
carefully
examine
the
precise
legal
significance
of
those
findings.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
when
the
argument
was
interrupted,
we
were
discussing
the
specific
district
court
findings.
it
will
be
recalled
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
vessel
was
on
sea,
and
vessel
owner
negligent
in
three
respects:
in
failing
to
secure
the
cargo
in
mobile,
in
failing
to
dunnage
off
the
cargo
in
mobile,
and
because
of
the
presence
of
the
piece
of
the
paper
covering
the
crack
which
was
the
immediate
cause
of
the
plaintiff's
injury.
the
district
court
also
found
that
cooper
was
negligent
in
two
respects
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
secure
and
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
dunnage
off
in
mobile.
now,
the
precise
legal
significance
of
these
findings
has
to
be
rather
carefully
scrutinized.
first
of
all,
it's
to
be
noted
that
there
is
no
finding
of
joint
liability
of
the
ship
and
cooper
to
the
plaintiff.
there
is
no
finding
of
joint
liability
because
the
plaintiff,
if
it
will
be
recalled,
did
not
sue
cooper.
now,
the
significance
of
this
is
that
since
the
plaintiff
did
not
sue
cooper,
there
is
thus
no
and
i
am
quoting
here
from
respondent's
brief,
“no
common
liability
for
concurrent
fault”
which
is,'
and
again
i
am
to
use
the
words
of
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
25
which
is
the
'sine
qua
non
of
contribution'.
that
is,
there
is
no
joint
liability
because
the
plaintiff
didn't
sue
cooper.
the
second
significance
of
the
district
court's
findings
is
that
cooper
negligence
was
found
to
be
negligence
vis-à-vis
the
plaintiff.
that
is
the
acts
which
cooper
did.
the
failing
to
secure
and
the
failing
to
done
a
job
were
found
on
a
careful
examination
of
the
district
court's
findings
at
a
163
and
164
of
the
appendix
are
found
to
be
negligence
because
of
--
this
created
a
risk
of
harm
to
the
plaintiff
and
subsequent
longshoreman.
but
these
findings
are
legally
immaterial
because
again
the
plaintiff
for
tactical
considerations
did
not
sue
cooper.
the
third
legal
significance
to
these
findings
is
that
under
these
findings
and
under
the
undisputed
fact,
there
is
not
found
to
be
any
breach
of
duty
by
cooper
to
the
vessel.
because
the
two
things
cooper
was
faulted
for,
failing
to
secure
and
failing
to
dunnage
as
between
the
ship
and
cooper.
the
ultimate
decision
there
was
made
by
the
ship.
it
was
the
ship
that
decided
whether
or
not
to
dunnage.
if
the
ship
wanted
it
dunnaged,
the
evidence
shows
cooper
would
have
dunnage.
if
the
ship
wanted
the
cargo
secure,
cooper
would
have
been
happy
to
secure
the
cargo
for
of
course
an
additional
price.
but
those
decisions
were
decisions
of
the
ship.
thus,
regardless
of
this
court's
treatment
of
the
more
general
problem
before
the
court,
namely
the
right
of
contribution
between
joint
tortfeasors
in
admiralty,
there
are
two
very
specific
reasons
in
this
specific
case,
why
this
is
an
improper
case
for
contribution.
first
of
all,
because
as
we
have
seen
that
the
party
which
has
been
granted
contribution,
the
vessel
has
already
been
fully
indemnified.
it
was
fully
indemnified
by
mid-gulf
stevedores.
so
that
if
we
view
the
case
as
one
where
it
is
the
vessel
which
is
suing
cooper
for
contribution,
the
vessel's
cause
of
action
is
extinguished.
the
court
might
feel
but
why
it
isn't
the
real
party
at
interest
here
mid-gulf,
because
mid-gulf
has
stepped
into
the
shoes
of
the
vessel
and
it
has
taken
over
the
vessel's
defense.
but
if
that's
the
situation,
then
contribution
is
doubly
unfair
because
if
the
plaintiff
--
let
us
change
this
situations
like,
had
the
plaintiff
sued
cooper
alone.
let's
assume
for
instance
the
ship
was
not
--
could
not
get
jurisdiction
over
the
ship
but
the
vessel
owner
was
in
souvenir
something
of
that
sort.
so,
the
plaintiff
sues
only
cooper.
cooper
even
under
the
rule
urged
by
the
respondent
would
not
be
able
to
get
contribution
from
mid-gulf
because
mid-gulf
is
statutorily
immune
from
direct
action
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
its
actual
loss
is
measured
by
the
liability
of
the
vessel
to
the
plaintiff
which
is
the
amount
of
the
judgment.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
suggestion
is
circular.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
indemnity
or
contribution'
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
well,
under
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
entire
liability
was
imposed
on
the
vessel.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
full
amount
of
the
judgment
is
assessed
against
the
vessel
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
and
then
the
vessel
is
entitled
to
contribution
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
from
cooper.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
50%.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
but
in
the
first
instance
before
we
reach
that
point
and
indeed
that
point
has
been
reached,
the
judgment
against
the
plaintiff
is
no
longer
in
the
case
and
the
plaintiff's
judgment
has
been
satisfied
and
has
been
satisfied
by
mid-gulf
as
the
refusal
statement
in
the
brief
of
the
fifth
circuit
says
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i'm
not
sure
this
issue
has
ever
been
confronted
in
maritime
law
but
in
this
instance,
mid-gulf
did
not
take
an
assignment
of
the
vessel's
action.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
well,
of
course
that's
correct,
but
of
course
that
assumes,
of
course,
in
the
first
instant
that
there
is
a
right
of
contribution
which
is
the
more
general
issue
in
the
case,
i
appreciate
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
record
shows
the
total
amount
of
the
judgment
and
the
refusal
statement
in
the
fifth
circuit
brief
says
that
texas
employers
is
obligated
by
a
contract
of
the
indemnity
to
pay
any
judgment
rendered
against
the
vessel,
so
that
they
are
obligated
by
indemnity
to
pay
that
full
judgment.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
only
indirectly,
the
record
shows
how
much
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i've
forgotten
the
exact
amount,
$38,000.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that
has
been
settled.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
by
texas
employers
insurance
associate.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
through
the
insurer
for
mid-gulf
stevedores.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
right.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
the
vessel
got
out
of
the
case
in
advance
of
the
trial
and
the
suit
is
prosecuted
only
in
the
name
of
the
vessel,
even
though
mid-gulf
did
not
take
an
assignment
of
the
vessel's
cause
of
action
whatever
that
cause
of
action
may
be.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
that
my
client
cooper
will
be
obligated
to
reimburse
the
vessel,
actually
texas
employers
for
one-half
of
what
texas
employers
has
paid.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
insurer.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
true
but
mid-gulf
would
never
even
under
the
rule
urge
that
respondents
would
not
be
able
to
have
done
that
directly
because
it
surely
can't
be
said
to
have
a
right
of
contribution
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
--
against
cooper
because
cooper
had
no
right
of
contribution.
(voice
overlap)
it
could
insist
and
surely
there
is
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
well,
the
vessel,
it
quotes,
the
fictional
vessel.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
in
advance
of
trial,
mid-gulf
took
over
the
defense
of
the
vessel
but
the
counsel
were
substituted.
let
us
move
to
the
more
general
issue.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
it
was
not
addressed
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
it
was
the
subject
of
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
fact
it
consumed,
i
think
the
greater
part
of
the
oral
argument,
and
i
think
both
--
it's
fair
to
say
both
counsel
were
somewhat
surprised
that
the
problem
was
not
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
i
think
we
are
in
agreement.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that
there
was
indemnification.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
record
is
clear.
mr.
smith
testified
at
that
matter
at
the
trial
of
the
case.
this
question,
the
question
i
am
urging,
the
point
i
am
urging,
this
point
was
raised
in
the
district
court
and
mr.
smith,
the
counsel,
appearing
of
record
for
the
vessel
who
had
previously
been
counseled
for
the
stevedores
was
called
as
a
witness
by
kopke
and
testified
these
matters.
it
appears
of
record
there
and
it
appears
of
record
in
the
refusal
statement
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit
brief.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
the
more
general
issue
involved
in
the
case
involves
the
right
of
contribution
in
admiralty
generally.
for
purposes
of
oral
argument,
i
would
like
to
suggest
and
i
see
my
time
is
running
short,
that
this
problem
be
approached
by
seeing
what
are
the
conceivable
rules
that
the
court
could
develop
here.
first
and
i
submit
that
the
existing
rule
is
that
the
law
draws
a
distinction
between
collision
cases
on
the
one
hand
and
non-collision
cases
on
the
other.
in
collision
cases,
there
is
a
right
of
contribution,
in
non-collision
cases,
there
is
no
right
of
contribution.
this
is
what
the
halcyon
decision
says.
this
was
expressly
reaffirmed
by
the
court
two
years
ago
in
the
atlantic
case.
that's
the
current
law.
the
law
is
urged
by
the
respondents
is
the
opposite
into
the
spectrum
as
embodied
by
the
fifth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
and
in
its
earlier
decision
in
watz
against
zapata
which
is
that
there
is
a
right
of
contribution,
except
generally,
except
where
the
party
against
whom
contribution
is
sought
is
statutorily
immune.
i
would
suggest
that
there
may
well
be
middle
grounds
between
these
two
polar
positions.
the
middle
grounds
being
that
a
right
of
contribution
could
be
granted
in
all
instances
saved
where
the
parties,
the
relationship
was
governed
by
the
ryan
indemnity
doctrine.
alternatively,
a
right
of
contribution
could
be
granted
either
in
all
non-personal
injury
cases
or
in
all
non-harbor
workers
compensation
cases.
if
i
have
time,
i
would
like
to
discuss
possible
rationales
for
those
approaches.
the
first
approach,
that
is
the
existing
law,
the
halcyon
atlantic
approach
may
appear
at
first
blush
to
be
artificial
why
a
distinction
between
collision
and
non-collision
cases.
the
distinction
is
a
sound
one
and
that
is
that
collision
cases
which
are
perhaps
the
oldest
form
of
maritime
litigation
had
well
developed
rules
governing
these
situations
long
in
advance
of
any
legislative
activity
in
the
area.
these
rules
even
predate
the
19th
century
activity
of
this
court
in
the
field.
on
the
other
hand,
in
non-collision
cases
as
justice
black's
opinion
points
out
so
clearly
in
the
halcyon
case.
there
is
substantial
legislative
activity.
that
legislative
--
this
is
most
pervasive
in
personal
injury
is
somewhat
less
pervasive
elsewhere
but
is
notable
for
instance
in
cargo
damage
cases.
but
all
legislative
activity
in
the
field
has
always
stop
short
of
creating
a
right
of
contribution.
traditionally,
contribution
can
only
be
created
by
the
legislatures.
indeed,
in
the
states
which
have
adopted
contribution,
it
has
almost
been
invariably
done
by
legislation
as
opposed
to
judicial
enactment.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
was
developed
judicially
but
it
was
developed
judicially
long
before
any
legislative
activity
generally,
in
the
fields
which
are
at
dispute
in
this
case.
in
those
areas,
the
legislation
has
never
enacted
contributions.
in
most
recently,
of
course,
the
rules
were
substantially
changed
in
1972
amendments.
those
amendments
to
the
compensation
act
were
enacted
against
the
backdrop
of
the
sieracki,
halcyon
and
ryan,
atlantic,
line
of
decisions.
they
were
carefully
tightened
to
meet
those
decisions
and
make
very
precise
adjustments
in
the
rights
of
plaintiff
versus
ship
versus
stevedoring.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
fifth
circuit
applied
it
broadly
until
the
late
60's
and
it
was
not
until
1972
that
the
second
circuit
went
along.
this
is
a
very
recent
phenomenon
where
lower
courts
have
felt
they
could
disregard
the
halcyon,
the
clear
language
of
halcyon,
all
during
the
50's
and
the
early
60's.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
correct.
if
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
didn't
know
the
perils
of
argument.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
should
hope.
the
disregarding
of
halcyon
is
a
recent
phenomenon.
and
i
do
not
think
it's
fair
to
restrict
halcyon
to
the
specific
facts
of
halcyon.
this
court
simply
cannot
just
brush
to
one
side,
the
whole
basis
for
halcyon
and
likewise
in
atlantic,
the
atlantic
case
was
a
totally
different
situation
because
they
are
the
party
against
the
contribution
--
was
not
statutorily
immune.
he
could
have
been
sued.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
there
--
i
cannot
recall
any
specific
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
halcyon
case
as
such.
there
are
many
references
to
ryan,
and
implicit
in
the
congress
is
considerations
is
that
it
was
ryan
which
was
the
law
which
governed
the
relationships
between
parties
and
that
there
was
either
all
the
way
indemnity
or
no
indemnity.
and
in
this
respect,
the
decision
--
a
decision
here
must
take
into
account
the
ryan
case
because
an
analysis
of
a
given
fact
situation
under
ryan
may
yield
radically
different
results
than
traditional
analysis
under
contribution
rule.
because
depending
on
the
facts
can
yield
inconsistent
results.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
yes,
that's
correct.
the
watz
case
had
been
decided,
this
case
had
not
been
decided.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
the
second
circuit
case
in
re
seaboard
shipping
had
been
decided
--
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
think
it's
perhaps
speculative
because
i
don't
recall
at
least
in
the
legislative
history
any
reference
to
watz
or
seaboard
shipping
and
i
don't
think
it
is
really
fair
for
us
to
conclude
one
way
or
another
about
the
matter.
the
rule
urged
by
the
respondents
would
represent,
we
submit
a
radical
change
in
the
law
of
maritime
law
and
it
would
be
an
ill
advise
change.
briefly,
it
would
work
to
the
disadvantage
of
plaintiffs,
it
would
discourage
settlements,
it
cannot
be
harmonized
with
ryan.
the
court
would
be
called
upon.
there
is
a
great
body
of
law
under
ryan
which
would
have
to
be
completely
rearranged
and
changed,
putting
a
substantial
burden
on
the
lower
courts
and
on
this
court.
there
are
middle
grounds
which
would
expand
contribution
slightly
but
these
middle
grounds
would
be
to
grant
contribution
in
all
the
cases,
say
those
governed
by
ryan
or
the
grand
contribution
in
all
but
personal
injury
cases,
or
in
all
but
cases
where
the
plaintiff
was
a
beneficiary
of
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
i
would
like
to
make
just
a
few
brief
points.
first,
the
merits
of
the
contribution
rule
are
at
best
arguable
and
they
are
certainly
appropriate
for
legislation
not
for
judicial
action.
this
is
the
common
law
tradition.
they
are
legislative
because
they
vitally
effect
amongst
others
the
rights
of
injured
plaintiffs.
if
there
is
one
category
of
people
mr.
justice
stewart
who
cannot
be
adjusted,
whose
rights
cannot
be
adjusted
by
insurance,
it
is
the
plaintiff
(voice
overlap)
plaintiff
and
as
professor
james
points
out,
a
rule
of
contributions
severely
restricts
the
plaintiff's
rights
about
one-third
of
the
state.
well,
first,
the
states
are
closely
divided
on
the
merits
of
legislation
and
i
refer
your
honors,
to
the
yale
law
review
article
which
analyses
the
different
state
rule.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
on
the
merits
of
contributions.
only
a
bare
majority,
even
half
contribution.
mr.
joseph
d.
cheavens
that's
right,
of
those
and
that
is
viewed
all
by
legislation
and
of
those
nearly
one-third
of
those
do
so
only
where
the
plaintiff
has
as
a
matter
of
tactics
chosen
to
sue
and
has
obtained
a
finding
against
both
defendants,
that
has
not
occurred
here.
so
this
court
would
be
doubly
asked
to
create
a
rule
which
would
work
against
injured
plaintiffs
in
an
area
of
the
law
where
this
court
has
been
especially
solicitous
of
the
rights
of
injured
plaintiff.
the
rules
of
contribution
in
the
states
also
frequently
do
not
equally
apportion
but
do
so
in
a
comparative
thought
basis.
a
separate
matter
is
that
the
issue
of
ryan
indemnity
in
this
case
is
not
before
this
court,
the
fifth
circuit
denied
it.
ryan
indemnity
had
no
cross
petition
for
certiorari.
