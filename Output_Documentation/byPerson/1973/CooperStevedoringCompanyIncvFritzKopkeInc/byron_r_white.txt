but
if
mid-gulf
indemnified
the
ship,
it
would
it
indemnify
only
for
its
actual
lost.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
indemnity
for
out
of
pocket
loss
and
if
the
ship
doesn't
--
ultimately
is
liable
for
only
half
let's
say,
it's
only
out
of
pocket
for
half
the
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
somebody
is
going
to
--
let's
assume
the
vessel
secures
indemnity
from
cooper.
is
it
cooper'
yes
cooper.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
contribution,
assume
contribution.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
--
justice
byron
r.
white
50%?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
how
about
mid-gulf?
then
the
vessel
is
out
50%
of
the
liability
and
then
how
much
does
mid-gulf
have
to
pay
for
the
vessel?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
suggest
any
possible
reason
for
leaving
ryan
in
effect
or
negligence
is
at
issue,
but
not
unseaworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
was
just
--
it
must
have
been
then
just
an
oversight
or
just
bad
legislating
and
say
they
took
care
of
the
seaworthiness
thing
but
didn't
reach
the
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
not
talking
about
ship
liability,
we
are
talking
about
the
indemnity.
i
mean
they
did
away
with
the
indemnity
on
unseaworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
not
going
much
farther
than
you
have
to
win
in
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
urging
us
not
only
to
--
you're
urging
us
to
affirm
this
judgment
on
another
much
broader
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
prevail
by
just
that
--
it's
going
with
the
fifth
circuit.
you
do
not
need
to
overrule
or
urge
us
to
overrule
halcyon
and
ryan,
one
of
the
cases
that
need
you,
needs
you
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
right
now
is
if
the
judgment
below
was
reversed,
we're
changing
the
law
of
two
circuits,
aren't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
in
the
circuit
in
the
fifth
circuit,
halcyon
has
been
laid
to
rest
in
a
certain
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
rather
win
than
lose?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
amendments
expressly
apply
on
the
prospect
of
this
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
did
they
have
a
specific
provision
as
to
what
of
those
standards
would
apply
in
pending
legislation
or
in
pending
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
we
agreed
with
you
that
halcyon
should
not
be
read
as
preventing
contribution
on
these
factors
in
this
kind
of
situation.
are
you
also
urging
that
there
should
be
a
different
rule
of
contribution
than
50/50?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
urging
comparative
negligence
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
maritime
collision
rule
is
50/50
no
matter
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
the
fifth
circuit
applied
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
