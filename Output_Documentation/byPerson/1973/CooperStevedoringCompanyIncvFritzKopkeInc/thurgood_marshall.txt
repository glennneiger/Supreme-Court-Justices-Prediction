mr.
smith,
what
were
you
suing
for,
how
much
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
have
any
idea
that
there
was
$30,000.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
next
stage,
would
you
sell
for
$5,000.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn't
sell
for
less
than
38,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
smith
how
do
we
explain
that
in
opinion,
we
say
that
congress
went
half
of
the
way
and
refuse
to
go
the
other
half
the
way,
so
we
will
go
to
other
half
the
way,
is
that
to
way
we
explain
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
here,
we
do
not
overrule
congress
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
congress
did
as
of
now,
this
is
far
as
we
want
to
go,
as
far
as
we
tend
go.
so
we
will
say
well
since
you
didn't
go,
we'll
go
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
anytime
we
amend
the
act
of
congress,
it
would
be
very
dynamic.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
and
where
they
would
not
go?

73-726,
cooper
stevedoring
co.
versus
kopke
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
a
longshoreman
was
injured
when,
while
loading
a
vessel
owned
by
the
respondent,
he
stepped
into
concealed
gap
between
crates
which
had
previously
been
loaded
by
petitioner.
the
longshoreman
sued
the
respondent,
the
shipowner
who
filed
a
third-party
complaint
against
the
petitioner,
the
stevedoring
co.
the
district
court
found
both
the
respondent
and
the
petitioner
negligent
and
divided
the
liability
equally.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
petitioner's
contention
that
the
award
of
contribution
between
joint
tortfeasors
in
this
noncollision
maritime
case
was
inconsistent
with
earlier
decision
to
this
court.
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
the
opinion
filed
over
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
was
proper
for
the
courts
below
to
have
applied
to
well-established
maritime
rule
allowing
contribution
between
joint
tortfeasors.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
is
accordingly
affirmed.
