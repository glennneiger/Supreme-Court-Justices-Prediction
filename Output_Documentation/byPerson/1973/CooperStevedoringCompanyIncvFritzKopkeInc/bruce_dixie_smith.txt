mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
confusion
that
mr.
cheavens
has
created
about
this
full
indemnity
point.
first
of
all,
after
the
plaintiff
sued
steamship
company,
the
steamship
company
sued
the
houston
stevedores
mid-gulf
stevedoring
company
on
the
ryan
theory
of
indemnity
and
they
also
sued
cooper
stevedoring
company
and
mobile
on
a
similar
type
case
but
for
two
separate
breaches
of
what
the
ship
felt
like
was
a
breach
of
the
implied
ryan
warranty
running
to
the
vessel.
one,
the
negligence
in
the
way
the
vessel
was
loaded
and
mobile
which
is
an
entirely
separate
cause
of
action
that
the
ship
had
against
the
mobile
stevedore
and
they
also
had
a
separate
cause
of
action
against
the
houston
stevedores.
my
firm
represented
the
houston
mid-gulf
stevedores.
prior
to
trial,
we
negotiated
out
of
settlement
with
our
differences
with
the
vessel
and
as
part
of
the
settlement
agreement
of
that
cause
of
action,
we
assume
that
the
defense
of
the
vessel.
there
has
been
nothing
in
the
evidence
ever
about
what
the
real
exact
terms
of
the
settlement
were.
the
first
time
this
ever
came
up,
cooper
filed
no
cross
actions
against
us
although
they
were
free
to
do
so,
they're
not
statutorily
immune
or
we're
not
statutorily
immune
from
being
sued
by
another
stevedoring
and
this
has
happened.
but
they
didn't
sue
us.
during
the
trial,
mr.
harm,
one
of
trial
attorney
for
cooper
put
me
on
a
stand
quite
by
a
surprise
and
asked
me
about
the
terms
of
the
settlement
agreement.
well,
i
didn't
even
make
them.
the
attorney
that
was
handling
the
case
before
i
got
it
is
one
that
worked
out
the
settlement
with
the
ship
and
i
just
went
in
to
trial
the
case
and
i
am
handling
it
since.
but
at
that
time
i
didn't
know
exactly
what
term
where
i
had
general
idea,
but
the
part
of
the
terms
of
the
agreement
were
that
we
would
indemnify
--
we
took
over
the
defense
of
the
vessel
as
the
vessel.
so,
we
stepped
in
the
shoes
of
the
vessel
and
then
dismissed
ourselves
out
of
this
case
and
proceeded
on
and
just
the
plaintiff
against
the
ship,
against
the
mobile
stevedore
and
that's
the
way
the
case
has
come
up.
and
legal
issues
involved
should
be
determined
on
that
point.
this
can
be
a
very
important
case
and
i
think
mr.
cheavens
has
done
a
good
job
to
kind
of
confuse
the
matter.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
we
were
pursuing
the
ship's
claim
against
cooper
for
whatever
we
might
have
to
pay
the
plaintiff
if
we
lost
on
a
basic
suit
of
the
plaintiff
against
the
ship.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no,
not
at
that
time.
that's
the
way
these
cases
developed
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
plaintiff
sues
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
i
thought
in
the
court's
findings
found
that
the
mobile
stevedore
breached
its
warranty
and
a
workmanlike
service
to
the
vessel
and
under
the
ryan
cases,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
full
indemnity
at
that
time.
but
we
wanted
here
to
try
the
case
after
the
agreement
between
the
houston
stevedore
and
the
ships
--
and
the
ship
was
negotiated.
then
we
went
on
to
try
and
file
the
case
just
as
we
normally
do
with
all
three
parties
being
present
to
find
that
out
among
ourselves.
when
it's
asserting
to
see
to
get
back
to
what
the
court
actually
found
in
the
case.
that
they
found
that
cooper
was
negligent
in
the
way
they
loaded
the
ship
in
mobile.
that
as
a
result
of
the
negligent
cooper,
the
way
they
loaded
the
ship
they
breached
that
ryan
warranty
workmanlike
service.
the
court
seemed
to
find
that
the
ship
was
negligent
too
in
not
discovering
the
negligence
of
cooper
as
about
the
best
where
you
can
read
the
court's
findings.
but
the
court
did
not
find
that
the
ship
was
precluded
from
indemnity
and
in
fact
just
ignored
our
claim
for
indemnity
under
the
ryan
doctrine
and
just
announced
where
he
is
going
to
split
the
damages
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
the
ship.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
i'm
the
ship.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
for
what?
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
mid-gulf
was
dismissed
out
of
it
and
no
fact
findings
that
mid-gulf
did
anything
wrong.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
correct,
one
part
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
longshoreman
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
cooper
stevedore
and
mobile.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
we
paid
off
the
judgment
and
now
we
were
fighting
among
ourselves.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
this
was
very
standard,
really
a
simple
situation.
we
look
there
in
the
right
perspective.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
--
we
have
argued
--
fifth
circuit
and
further
the
district
court
awarding
or
affirmed
that
stevedore
was
negligent
that
it
breached
its
warranty
and
affirmed
the
50%
contribution
and
more
or
less
assumed
in
its
opinion
that
the
stevedores
--
the
ship
was
precluded
from
full
indemnity
because
the
judge
didn't
give
it
to
him.
there
is
no
fact-finding,
there
is
no
really
evidence
in
anywhere
in
the
case
that
the
ship
was
precluded
from
recovery
of
full
indemnity,
it's
just
been
something
that
has
been
ignored.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
that
is
right;
we
asked
for
it,
they
did
not
give
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
they
did
not
call
me
honored
judge.
they
could
have
said
that
it
is
denied
because
and
they
did
not
just
address
themselves
to
it
just
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
$38,697.90
i
think,
plus
our
current
split
--
but
now
the
case
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
half
of
that.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
they
gave
50%
but
do
not
split
it
50/50
and
we
paid
off
half
plaintiff
and
now
are
at
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
they
didn't
address
themselves
to
attorney's
fee
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
the
way
we
handled
that
judge
is
normally,
in
this
type
of
situation,
if
we
get
full
indemnity
we
usually
agree
on
the
attorney's
fees
between
the
parties
and
then
if
we
can
agree
we
go
back
to
district
court
and
he
awards
it.
but
we
usually
work
these
things
out.
the
case
is
up
here,
and
mr.
cheavens
has
asked
you
to,
i
think,
take
a
limited
approach
the
way
you
decide
this
case.
as
i
see
it,
the
court
can
take
a
limited
view
and
that
they
can
affirm
the
case
just
and
say
there
is
contribution
in
this
fact
situation.
but
this
leaves,
i
think
as
mr.
cheavens
pointed
out
some
conflicts,
that's
going
to
cause
them
trouble
in
some
of
the
district
court.
you
could
reverse
this
case
and
just
hold
that
under
house,
there
will
be
no
contribution
in
any
non-maritime
situation,
non-collision
maritime
situation.
i
think
this
is
will
be
a
horrible
thing
to
do
because
as
for
reason,
i
will
get
into,
i
think
it
would
make
the
law
a
lot
more
confused
and
a
lot
more
arbitrary
than
it
is
now.
now,
you
can
take
a
third
solution
to
the
case
and
i
think
that
kind
of
leave
the
law
exactly
like
it
is.
you
can
decide,
then
on
the
fact-findings
that
i
was
entitled
to
full
indemnity
and
just
under
ryan,
give
me
full
indemnity,
but
that
would
not
change
the
law
and
leave
it
exactly
where
it
is
today
and
i
don't
think
the
court
granted
a
writ
in
this
case
to
do
that.
now,
i
am
going
to
suggest
a
rather
bold
sweeping
approach
that
the
court
can
clear
up
this
whole
area
for
generations
to
come.
if
you
look
at
the
case
from
a
broad
standpoint.
now,
before
i
get
--
what
i
want
to
suggest,
i
would
like
to
review
historically
the
law
in
this
field.
in
1946,
this
court
passed
a
sieracki
opinion
which
in
effect
granted
the
right
of
a
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
to
cover
longshoreman.
a
longshoreman
could
sue
vessels
for
an
unseaworthy
condition
which
mounts
to
almost
absolute
liability
without
fault.
as
a
result,
after
the
sieracki
opinion,
the
longshoreman
around
the
country
started
suing
the
vessel
owners
and
recovering
substantial
amounts
of
money
and
it
was
beginning
to
get
out
of
hand.
and
in
1952,
the
steamship
company
and
halcyon
on
the
case
sued
the
stevedores
that
caused
unseaworthy
condition
to
try
to
get
some
relief.
they
felt
it
was
kind
of
unjust
that
stevedores
could
go
on
board,
create
an
unseaworthy
condition
and
then
the
steamship
company
had
to
pay
for
it.
so,
the
court
took
the
case
on
review
but
because
of
the
statutory
immunity
of
the
stevedore
denied
the
rights
of
the
ship
to
collect
contribution
in
the
halcyon
on
the
case.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
it's
in
the
opinion
that
section
5
of
the
act
and
then
you
kind
of
--
there
is
a
lot
of
dictum
in
the
case
so
that
is
why,
i
think
there
is
so
much
trouble
as
to
what
halcyon
really
means.
but
anyway,
they
didn't
let
--
the
ship
have
contribution
against
stevedore
and
then
things
really
got
in
to
high
gear.
until
1956
when
the
court
handed
down
ryan,
did
not
address
itself
to
the
contribution
issue
but
came
out
with
this
warranty
workmanlike
service
theory
to
grant
full
indemnity.
so,
where
the
man's
employer,
the
stevedore
employer
breached
this,
here
before
unknown
warranty
and
in
somehow
was
contractual
theory
in
the
negligence
lawsuit,
then
it
got
to
be
a
100%.
one,
the
ship
either
had
to
pay
a
100%
of
the
stevedore
debt
and
this
is
a
way
it's
going
since
then.
in
yiatchos
1963,
you
extended
it
even
further.
then
in
1964,
you
backed
off
a
little
bit
with
the
italia
decision,
that
the
ship
was
guilty
of
such
conduct
sufficient
to
preclude
then
the
stevedore
wouldn't
have
to
pay
100%
even
if
it
breaks
its
warranty.
but
here
again,
both
ways,
because
of
the
ryan
case
which
in
effect
respondent
came
about
because
of
the
sieracki
opinion,
you
have
got
two
parties
as
many
times
equally
at
fault
or
both
at
fault
having
one
of
them
having
to
pay
all
of
the
money
and
it's
inequitable
and
it
has
been
criticized
by
many
court,
by
many
scholar
and
it
got
so
bad.
and
in
1972,
congress
drastically
amended
the
longshoreman's
act.
one
of
the
things
they
did
was
that
they
took
away
the
longshoreman's
right
to
sue
the
ship
for
unseaworthiness.
this
in
effect
overrules
the
sieracki
opinion
that
came
down
in
1946.
number
two,
they
said
that
section
5
of
the
act
means
what
it
says
that
steamship
company
can't
sue
the
employer
either
for
implied
warranty
or
expressed
warranty
that
even
if
they
contract
that
they
consume,
they
can't
do
it.
this
in
effect
overrules
ryan
as
it
applies
to
the
injured
man's
employer
which
was
what
ryan
came
out
at
that
particular
fact
situation.
so,
amendments
to
the
1972
act
affectively
reversed
two
prior
leading
cases
that
they
have
caused
all
these,
that
is,
sieracki
and
ryan.
now
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no,
sir
they
don't.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
that's
right
and
even
if
this
act
does
not
happen
today.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
we
still
have
the
same
situation,
this
is
what
i
am
getting
here.
the
ship
can
still
sue
cooper
stevedoring
company
if
accident
happened
today.
they
could
sue
cooper
tomorrow
for
breaching
the
ryan
warranty
of
stevedore
is
not
the
employer
and
ryan
wasn't
intended
to
come
up
that
way
anyway.
what
i
want
to
suggest
that
this
court
do
is
go
ahead
and
abolish
ryan
completely.
congress
has
done
so
drastically
where
a
situation
applies
most
of
the
time
anyway
between
the
employer,
the
injured
longshoreman
and
the
ship.
but
ryan
also
has
been
spread
over
to
cover
particularly
in
the
fifth
circuit
area
where
we
have
so
much
off
shore
activity
in
maritime
situations
and
ryan
has
been
applied
and
not
applied
in
so
many
of
these
other
situations
where
it's
been
fit.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no,
congress,
i
think
effectively
overruled
the
original
ryan
opinion
in
the
context
in
which
it
arose.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
that
is
a
very,
very
broad
thing
for
congress
to
do.
i
think
this
court
created
the
problem
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
court
under
the
historical
context,
that
this
court
ought
to
step
in
and
correct
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
not
in
the
way
the
law
is
set
up
now
with
the
amendments
to
the
longshoreman's
act
of
cutting
out
or
doing
away
with
ryan
and
a
big
portion
of
the
cases
you
are
going
to
have
ryan
not
applied
in
most
of
the
cases
where
it
was
and
then
still
applying
in
some
other
cases
where
it
wasn't
intended.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
justice
stewart
i
don't
believe
that
the
legislative
history
would
indicate
that
there
were
a
lot
of
maritime
inference
that
this
ryan
case
could
not
affect
with
present
and
negotiate
it
the
amendments
of
the
act.
the
stevedoring
companies,
the
steamship
companies
and
the
labor
unions
were
the
ones
that
hammer
this
out
with
congress
and
there
are
a
lot
of
other
inference
that
are
affected
by
ryan
that
i
do
not
think
they
are
considered
and
i
do
not
think
that
they
were
trying
to
correct
ryan
in
every
position
or
every
possibility
that
it
could
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
and
that
what
i
am
fixing,
that's
my
latter
point.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
this
was
covered
and
they
did
this
on
purpose.
there
was
the
steamship
industry
pushed
very
strongly
to
do
away
with
all
third
party
suits
by
longshoremen
against
vessels
for
unseaworthiness
or
negligence
and
congress
and
the
department
of
labor
expressly
rejected
this
because
of
the
policy
they
want
to
encourage
steamship
companies
to
come
in
with
safe
ships
and
if
they
were
completely
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
indemnity
as
to
the
employer.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
it
came
certainly
on
seaworthiness.
all
the
steamship
companies
got
to
worry
about
(voice
overlap)
it
is
the
regular
negligence
case.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir
and
i
think
to
make
it
all
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
oh!
i
think
the
steamship
company
can
sue
any
other
negligent
third
parties
that
has
powers
to
wrong.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no.
but
as
what
i
am
saying
is,
i
think
that
since
that
plaintiff
can
sue
the
ship
for
negligence
and
the
plaintiff's
case
is
governed
by
comparative
negligence
that
if
he
is
30%
at
fault,
his
damages
are
do
serve
by.
alright,
he
is
no
longer
has
an
unseaworthiness
frankly,
then
go
ahead
and
--
to
allow
contribution
or
comparative
negligence
between
the
ship,
or
anybody
else
that
the
ship
might
sue
or
the
plaintiff
might
sue.
in
this
case,
it's
conceivable
that
the
plaintiff
could
have
sued
cooper
directly
and
so
he
could
have
gotten
the
judgment
directly
against
him
or
the
judge
could
have
found
that
we
were
both
at
fault
and
awarded
a
50%
judgment
against
cooper
and
a
50%
judgment
against
the
ship.
it
could
have
done
that,
it
just
didn't
choose
to
do
it.
what
i
am
suggesting
here
is
to
go
ahead
and
put
it
in
these
three
party
suits
or
in
this
whole
area
maritime
personnel
law,
put
it
on
a
comparative
negligence
basis.
let
the
plaintiff
sue
anybody
who
thinks
he
is
at
fault.
on
negligence
three,
comparative
negligence
as
far
as
the
contrib
go
and
as
to
the
negligence
to
the
fault
of
tortfeasors,
let
them
all
pay
their
fair
share.
if
you
got
two
more
people
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
that's
why
you
got
this
bad
conflict.
congress
came
back
in
1972
and
says
that
the
employer
will
be
immune
because
of
his
payments
or
part
payments.
compensation
where
they
up
the
benefits
substantially
and
that's
all
employer
is
going
to
have
to
pay.
now,
among
other
guilty
party,
i
think
the
plaintiff
is
free
to
sue
anybody
he
wants
to
and
they
should
be
able
to
sue
themselves
or
each
other
on
a
comparative
basis.
and
since
there
is
no
more
ryan
warranty
to
the
employer,
there
will
not
to
be
a
ryan
warranty
to
anybody
else.
and
this
other
situation
where
did
ryan
apply
and
where
it
does
not
apply
is
really
mud
in
the
water.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
the
ryan
case
(voice
overlap)
you
overruled
the
standing
authority
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
in
the
maritime
law.
you
just
said
that
you
overrule
on
that
decision
and
what
i
have
indeed
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no,
you
do
not
overrule
congress
here.
you
are
coming
in
to
following
congress'
lead.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
i
think
in
fairness
(voice
overlap)
uniformity
and
fairness
when
everybody
agrees
that
there
is
an
100%
indemnity
theory
is
unjust.
congress
thought
so
because
they
did
away
with
it
in
that
situation.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
exactly.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
is
what
i
have
been
trying
to
state
here.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
your
honor,
i
think
they
have
still
just
as
much
certainty
here
and
it
would
be
a
lot
more
justice
in
that
those
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
justice
stewart
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
but
i
do
not
think
insurance
companies
are
entitled
to
justice
just
like
anybody
else.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
but
i
think
you
all
might
to
give
to
pay
for
the
entries
they
bill
and
not
encourage
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
nothing.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
let
us
say
on
the
same
(voice
overlap)
halcyon
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir
it's
not.
that
man
was
paid
--
the
atlantic
case,
they
got
into
trial
and
almost
through
trial
before
they
knew
there
was
maritime
question.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
in
the
briefs
of
his
employer,
he
was
paid
longshoreman
of
harbor
workers'
compensation
benefits
section
5
of
the
act
applied.
they
pled
it,
they
argued
into
their
briefs
and
under
the
halcyon
situation
where
the
employer
has
paid
his
compensation
under
the
federal
act,
there's
no
conflict
at
all.
the
employer
was
immune
from
contribution.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
first
of
all
i'm
not
urging
to
overrule.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
distinguished
very
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
oh
yes
sir.[laughter]
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
that
was
before
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
before
the
1972
amendment.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
we
rephrase
for
ryan
indemnity.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
why
--
we
would
be
immune.
just
sit
back
and
watch.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
i
doubt
about
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
they
went
into
effect
in
latter
part
of
november
1972.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
and
i
have
tried
a
number
of
cases,
since
the
act
was
amended
but
when
the
acts
did
not
happen
before
and
we
have
handled
all
the
way
through
under
the
old
ryan
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
probably
not
but
possibly.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
that
is
right
justice
brennan.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
addressing
myself
back
to
justice
white's
question
that
in
contribution
the
general
theory
behind
it
is
that
joint
tortfeasors
opt
to
pay
their
part
of
the
wrong
that
they
caused
an
injury
to
somebody.
and
then
there
is
just
no
logical
reason
in
a
non-collision
maritime
situation
where
you
do
not
have
employer
involved
as
we
don't
have
here.
that
is
why
the
plaintiff
just
chooses
to
save
one
of
them,
why
they
cannot
sue
a
co-tortfeasor
waterman
and
then
divide
the
damages
or
as
they
approve
or
not.
i
just
do
not
think
it's
fair
or
just
or
equitable
that
you
have
--
and
particularly
where
you
have
contribution
in
so
many
other
areas
of
tort
law.
there
is
the
single
layout
maritime
law
and
just
say
we
won't
have
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
unlike
when
you
got
two
co-tortfeasors,
if
you
have
contribution
it
is
50/50
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
i
think
comparative
negligence
would
be
if
you
are
going
to
right
in
this
area,
i
am
like
comparative
negligence
would
be
the
more
equitable
way
to
do
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
the
divided
damages
rule
but
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no.
i
mentioned
the
divided
damages.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
judge
singleton,
the
district
court
judge
said,
'i
am
going
to
find
you
both
equally
about
50/50.'
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
and
so
that's
what
he
did
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
the
way
you
have
both
damages
and
divide
it
by
half,
and
the
one
who
has
the
least
damage
pays
the
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes.
22
called
tortfeasor
(voice
overlap).
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
50/50,
the
first
three
is
divided
to
tort.
this
case
can
be
far
reaching
one,
can
be
limited.
i
know
i
have
suggested
something
that
you
probably
did
not
expect,
but
i
think
that
give
this
consideration
and
at
least
your
honors,
please
affirm
this
case
as
to
contribution
in
any
way.
but
i
think
that
this
could
be
a
very
dynamic
case
and
handles
of
this
whole
area
of
law
if
you
take
one
step
further
or
at
least
give
it
some
consideration.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
justice
marshall,
you
will
not
be
amending
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
you
will
be
just
kind
of
dove-tailing
and
toggling
along
behind
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
just
doing
all
in
the
areas,
the
area
they
pointed
out
but
this
is
what
goes
that
far.
thank
you
very
much,
i
have
enjoyed
being
here.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
confusion
that
mr.
cheavens
has
created
about
this
full
indemnity
point.
first
of
all,
after
the
plaintiff
sued
steamship
company,
the
steamship
company
sued
the
houston
stevedores
mid-gulf
stevedoring
company
on
the
ryan
theory
of
indemnity
and
they
also
sued
cooper
stevedoring
company
and
mobile
on
a
similar
type
case
but
for
two
separate
breaches
of
what
the
ship
felt
like
was
a
breach
of
the
implied
ryan
warranty
running
to
the
vessel.
one,
the
negligence
in
the
way
the
vessel
was
loaded
and
mobile
which
is
an
entirely
separate
cause
of
action
that
the
ship
had
against
the
mobile
stevedore
and
they
also
had
a
separate
cause
of
action
against
the
houston
stevedores.
my
firm
represented
the
houston
mid-gulf
stevedores.
prior
to
trial,
we
negotiated
out
of
settlement
with
our
differences
with
the
vessel
and
as
part
of
the
settlement
agreement
of
that
cause
of
action,
we
assume
that
the
defense
of
the
vessel.
there
has
been
nothing
in
the
evidence
ever
about
what
the
real
exact
terms
of
the
settlement
were.
the
first
time
this
ever
came
up,
cooper
filed
no
cross
actions
against
us
although
they
were
free
to
do
so,
they're
not
statutorily
immune
or
we're
not
statutorily
immune
from
being
sued
by
another
stevedoring
and
this
has
happened.
but
they
didn't
sue
us.
during
the
trial,
mr.
harm,
one
of
trial
attorney
for
cooper
put
me
on
a
stand
quite
by
a
surprise
and
asked
me
about
the
terms
of
the
settlement
agreement.
well,
i
didn't
even
make
them.
the
attorney
that
was
handling
the
case
before
i
got
it
is
one
that
worked
out
the
settlement
with
the
ship
and
i
just
went
in
to
trial
the
case
and
i
am
handling
it
since.
but
at
that
time
i
didn't
know
exactly
what
term
where
i
had
general
idea,
but
the
part
of
the
terms
of
the
agreement
were
that
we
would
indemnify
--
we
took
over
the
defense
of
the
vessel
as
the
vessel.
so,
we
stepped
in
the
shoes
of
the
vessel
and
then
dismissed
ourselves
out
of
this
case
and
proceeded
on
and
just
the
plaintiff
against
the
ship,
against
the
mobile
stevedore
and
that's
the
way
the
case
has
come
up.
and
legal
issues
involved
should
be
determined
on
that
point.
this
can
be
a
very
important
case
and
i
think
mr.
cheavens
has
done
a
good
job
to
kind
of
confuse
the
matter.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
we
were
pursuing
the
ship's
claim
against
cooper
for
whatever
we
might
have
to
pay
the
plaintiff
if
we
lost
on
a
basic
suit
of
the
plaintiff
against
the
ship.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no,
not
at
that
time.
that's
the
way
these
cases
developed
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
plaintiff
sues
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
i
thought
in
the
court's
findings
found
that
the
mobile
stevedore
breached
its
warranty
and
a
workmanlike
service
to
the
vessel
and
under
the
ryan
cases,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
full
indemnity
at
that
time.
but
we
wanted
here
to
try
the
case
after
the
agreement
between
the
houston
stevedore
and
the
ships
--
and
the
ship
was
negotiated.
then
we
went
on
to
try
and
file
the
case
just
as
we
normally
do
with
all
three
parties
being
present
to
find
that
out
among
ourselves.
when
it's
asserting
to
see
to
get
back
to
what
the
court
actually
found
in
the
case.
that
they
found
that
cooper
was
negligent
in
the
way
they
loaded
the
ship
in
mobile.
that
as
a
result
of
the
negligent
cooper,
the
way
they
loaded
the
ship
they
breached
that
ryan
warranty
workmanlike
service.
the
court
seemed
to
find
that
the
ship
was
negligent
too
in
not
discovering
the
negligence
of
cooper
as
about
the
best
where
you
can
read
the
court's
findings.
but
the
court
did
not
find
that
the
ship
was
precluded
from
indemnity
and
in
fact
just
ignored
our
claim
for
indemnity
under
the
ryan
doctrine
and
just
announced
where
he
is
going
to
split
the
damages
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
the
ship.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
i'm
the
ship.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
for
what?
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
mid-gulf
was
dismissed
out
of
it
and
no
fact
findings
that
mid-gulf
did
anything
wrong.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
correct,
one
part
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
longshoreman
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
cooper
stevedore
and
mobile.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
we
paid
off
the
judgment
and
now
we
were
fighting
among
ourselves.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
this
was
very
standard,
really
a
simple
situation.
we
look
there
in
the
right
perspective.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
--
we
have
argued
--
fifth
circuit
and
further
the
district
court
awarding
or
affirmed
that
stevedore
was
negligent
that
it
breached
its
warranty
and
affirmed
the
50%
contribution
and
more
or
less
assumed
in
its
opinion
that
the
stevedores
--
the
ship
was
precluded
from
full
indemnity
because
the
judge
didn't
give
it
to
him.
there
is
no
fact-finding,
there
is
no
really
evidence
in
anywhere
in
the
case
that
the
ship
was
precluded
from
recovery
of
full
indemnity,
it's
just
been
something
that
has
been
ignored.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
that
is
right;
we
asked
for
it,
they
did
not
give
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
they
did
not
call
me
honored
judge.
they
could
have
said
that
it
is
denied
because
and
they
did
not
just
address
themselves
to
it
just
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
$38,697.90
i
think,
plus
our
current
split
--
but
now
the
case
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
half
of
that.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
they
gave
50%
but
do
not
split
it
50/50
and
we
paid
off
half
plaintiff
and
now
are
at
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
they
didn't
address
themselves
to
attorney's
fee
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
the
way
we
handled
that
judge
is
normally,
in
this
type
of
situation,
if
we
get
full
indemnity
we
usually
agree
on
the
attorney's
fees
between
the
parties
and
then
if
we
can
agree
we
go
back
to
district
court
and
he
awards
it.
but
we
usually
work
these
things
out.
the
case
is
up
here,
and
mr.
cheavens
has
asked
you
to,
i
think,
take
a
limited
approach
the
way
you
decide
this
case.
as
i
see
it,
the
court
can
take
a
limited
view
and
that
they
can
affirm
the
case
just
and
say
there
is
contribution
in
this
fact
situation.
but
this
leaves,
i
think
as
mr.
cheavens
pointed
out
some
conflicts,
that's
going
to
cause
them
trouble
in
some
of
the
district
court.
you
could
reverse
this
case
and
just
hold
that
under
house,
there
will
be
no
contribution
in
any
non-maritime
situation,
non-collision
maritime
situation.
i
think
this
is
will
be
a
horrible
thing
to
do
because
as
for
reason,
i
will
get
into,
i
think
it
would
make
the
law
a
lot
more
confused
and
a
lot
more
arbitrary
than
it
is
now.
now,
you
can
take
a
third
solution
to
the
case
and
i
think
that
kind
of
leave
the
law
exactly
like
it
is.
you
can
decide,
then
on
the
fact-findings
that
i
was
entitled
to
full
indemnity
and
just
under
ryan,
give
me
full
indemnity,
but
that
would
not
change
the
law
and
leave
it
exactly
where
it
is
today
and
i
don't
think
the
court
granted
a
writ
in
this
case
to
do
that.
now,
i
am
going
to
suggest
a
rather
bold
sweeping
approach
that
the
court
can
clear
up
this
whole
area
for
generations
to
come.
if
you
look
at
the
case
from
a
broad
standpoint.
now,
before
i
get
--
what
i
want
to
suggest,
i
would
like
to
review
historically
the
law
in
this
field.
in
1946,
this
court
passed
a
sieracki
opinion
which
in
effect
granted
the
right
of
a
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
to
cover
longshoreman.
a
longshoreman
could
sue
vessels
for
an
unseaworthy
condition
which
mounts
to
almost
absolute
liability
without
fault.
as
a
result,
after
the
sieracki
opinion,
the
longshoreman
around
the
country
started
suing
the
vessel
owners
and
recovering
substantial
amounts
of
money
and
it
was
beginning
to
get
out
of
hand.
and
in
1952,
the
steamship
company
and
halcyon
on
the
case
sued
the
stevedores
that
caused
unseaworthy
condition
to
try
to
get
some
relief.
they
felt
it
was
kind
of
unjust
that
stevedores
could
go
on
board,
create
an
unseaworthy
condition
and
then
the
steamship
company
had
to
pay
for
it.
so,
the
court
took
the
case
on
review
but
because
of
the
statutory
immunity
of
the
stevedore
denied
the
rights
of
the
ship
to
collect
contribution
in
the
halcyon
on
the
case.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
it's
in
the
opinion
that
section
5
of
the
act
and
then
you
kind
of
--
there
is
a
lot
of
dictum
in
the
case
so
that
is
why,
i
think
there
is
so
much
trouble
as
to
what
halcyon
really
means.
but
anyway,
they
didn't
let
--
the
ship
have
contribution
against
stevedore
and
then
things
really
got
in
to
high
gear.
until
1956
when
the
court
handed
down
ryan,
did
not
address
itself
to
the
contribution
issue
but
came
out
with
this
warranty
workmanlike
service
theory
to
grant
full
indemnity.
so,
where
the
man's
employer,
the
stevedore
employer
breached
this,
here
before
unknown
warranty
and
in
somehow
was
contractual
theory
in
the
negligence
lawsuit,
then
it
got
to
be
a
100%.
one,
the
ship
either
had
to
pay
a
100%
of
the
stevedore
debt
and
this
is
a
way
it's
going
since
then.
in
yiatchos
1963,
you
extended
it
even
further.
then
in
1964,
you
backed
off
a
little
bit
with
the
italia
decision,
that
the
ship
was
guilty
of
such
conduct
sufficient
to
preclude
then
the
stevedore
wouldn't
have
to
pay
100%
even
if
it
breaks
its
warranty.
but
here
again,
both
ways,
because
of
the
ryan
case
which
in
effect
respondent
came
about
because
of
the
sieracki
opinion,
you
have
got
two
parties
as
many
times
equally
at
fault
or
both
at
fault
having
one
of
them
having
to
pay
all
of
the
money
and
it's
inequitable
and
it
has
been
criticized
by
many
court,
by
many
scholar
and
it
got
so
bad.
and
in
1972,
congress
drastically
amended
the
longshoreman's
act.
one
of
the
things
they
did
was
that
they
took
away
the
longshoreman's
right
to
sue
the
ship
for
unseaworthiness.
this
in
effect
overrules
the
sieracki
opinion
that
came
down
in
1946.
number
two,
they
said
that
section
5
of
the
act
means
what
it
says
that
steamship
company
can't
sue
the
employer
either
for
implied
warranty
or
expressed
warranty
that
even
if
they
contract
that
they
consume,
they
can't
do
it.
this
in
effect
overrules
ryan
as
it
applies
to
the
injured
man's
employer
which
was
what
ryan
came
out
at
that
particular
fact
situation.
so,
amendments
to
the
1972
act
affectively
reversed
two
prior
leading
cases
that
they
have
caused
all
these,
that
is,
sieracki
and
ryan.
now
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no,
sir
they
don't.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
that's
right
and
even
if
this
act
does
not
happen
today.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
we
still
have
the
same
situation,
this
is
what
i
am
getting
here.
the
ship
can
still
sue
cooper
stevedoring
company
if
accident
happened
today.
they
could
sue
cooper
tomorrow
for
breaching
the
ryan
warranty
of
stevedore
is
not
the
employer
and
ryan
wasn't
intended
to
come
up
that
way
anyway.
what
i
want
to
suggest
that
this
court
do
is
go
ahead
and
abolish
ryan
completely.
congress
has
done
so
drastically
where
a
situation
applies
most
of
the
time
anyway
between
the
employer,
the
injured
longshoreman
and
the
ship.
but
ryan
also
has
been
spread
over
to
cover
particularly
in
the
fifth
circuit
area
where
we
have
so
much
off
shore
activity
in
maritime
situations
and
ryan
has
been
applied
and
not
applied
in
so
many
of
these
other
situations
where
it's
been
fit.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no,
congress,
i
think
effectively
overruled
the
original
ryan
opinion
in
the
context
in
which
it
arose.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
that
is
a
very,
very
broad
thing
for
congress
to
do.
i
think
this
court
created
the
problem
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
court
under
the
historical
context,
that
this
court
ought
to
step
in
and
correct
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
not
in
the
way
the
law
is
set
up
now
with
the
amendments
to
the
longshoreman's
act
of
cutting
out
or
doing
away
with
ryan
and
a
big
portion
of
the
cases
you
are
going
to
have
ryan
not
applied
in
most
of
the
cases
where
it
was
and
then
still
applying
in
some
other
cases
where
it
wasn't
intended.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
justice
stewart
i
don't
believe
that
the
legislative
history
would
indicate
that
there
were
a
lot
of
maritime
inference
that
this
ryan
case
could
not
affect
with
present
and
negotiate
it
the
amendments
of
the
act.
the
stevedoring
companies,
the
steamship
companies
and
the
labor
unions
were
the
ones
that
hammer
this
out
with
congress
and
there
are
a
lot
of
other
inference
that
are
affected
by
ryan
that
i
do
not
think
they
are
considered
and
i
do
not
think
that
they
were
trying
to
correct
ryan
in
every
position
or
every
possibility
that
it
could
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
and
that
what
i
am
fixing,
that's
my
latter
point.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
this
was
covered
and
they
did
this
on
purpose.
there
was
the
steamship
industry
pushed
very
strongly
to
do
away
with
all
third
party
suits
by
longshoremen
against
vessels
for
unseaworthiness
or
negligence
and
congress
and
the
department
of
labor
expressly
rejected
this
because
of
the
policy
they
want
to
encourage
steamship
companies
to
come
in
with
safe
ships
and
if
they
were
completely
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
indemnity
as
to
the
employer.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
it
came
certainly
on
seaworthiness.
all
the
steamship
companies
got
to
worry
about
(voice
overlap)
it
is
the
regular
negligence
case.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir
and
i
think
to
make
it
all
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
oh!
i
think
the
steamship
company
can
sue
any
other
negligent
third
parties
that
has
powers
to
wrong.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no.
but
as
what
i
am
saying
is,
i
think
that
since
that
plaintiff
can
sue
the
ship
for
negligence
and
the
plaintiff's
case
is
governed
by
comparative
negligence
that
if
he
is
30%
at
fault,
his
damages
are
do
serve
by.
alright,
he
is
no
longer
has
an
unseaworthiness
frankly,
then
go
ahead
and
--
to
allow
contribution
or
comparative
negligence
between
the
ship,
or
anybody
else
that
the
ship
might
sue
or
the
plaintiff
might
sue.
in
this
case,
it's
conceivable
that
the
plaintiff
could
have
sued
cooper
directly
and
so
he
could
have
gotten
the
judgment
directly
against
him
or
the
judge
could
have
found
that
we
were
both
at
fault
and
awarded
a
50%
judgment
against
cooper
and
a
50%
judgment
against
the
ship.
it
could
have
done
that,
it
just
didn't
choose
to
do
it.
what
i
am
suggesting
here
is
to
go
ahead
and
put
it
in
these
three
party
suits
or
in
this
whole
area
maritime
personnel
law,
put
it
on
a
comparative
negligence
basis.
let
the
plaintiff
sue
anybody
who
thinks
he
is
at
fault.
on
negligence
three,
comparative
negligence
as
far
as
the
contrib
go
and
as
to
the
negligence
to
the
fault
of
tortfeasors,
let
them
all
pay
their
fair
share.
if
you
got
two
more
people
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
that's
why
you
got
this
bad
conflict.
congress
came
back
in
1972
and
says
that
the
employer
will
be
immune
because
of
his
payments
or
part
payments.
compensation
where
they
up
the
benefits
substantially
and
that's
all
employer
is
going
to
have
to
pay.
now,
among
other
guilty
party,
i
think
the
plaintiff
is
free
to
sue
anybody
he
wants
to
and
they
should
be
able
to
sue
themselves
or
each
other
on
a
comparative
basis.
and
since
there
is
no
more
ryan
warranty
to
the
employer,
there
will
not
to
be
a
ryan
warranty
to
anybody
else.
and
this
other
situation
where
did
ryan
apply
and
where
it
does
not
apply
is
really
mud
in
the
water.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
the
ryan
case
(voice
overlap)
you
overruled
the
standing
authority
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
in
the
maritime
law.
you
just
said
that
you
overrule
on
that
decision
and
what
i
have
indeed
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no,
you
do
not
overrule
congress
here.
you
are
coming
in
to
following
congress'
lead.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
i
think
in
fairness
(voice
overlap)
uniformity
and
fairness
when
everybody
agrees
that
there
is
an
100%
indemnity
theory
is
unjust.
congress
thought
so
because
they
did
away
with
it
in
that
situation.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
exactly.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
is
what
i
have
been
trying
to
state
here.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
your
honor,
i
think
they
have
still
just
as
much
certainty
here
and
it
would
be
a
lot
more
justice
in
that
those
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
justice
stewart
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
but
i
do
not
think
insurance
companies
are
entitled
to
justice
just
like
anybody
else.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes,
but
i
think
you
all
might
to
give
to
pay
for
the
entries
they
bill
and
not
encourage
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
nothing.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
let
us
say
on
the
same
(voice
overlap)
halcyon
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir
it's
not.
that
man
was
paid
--
the
atlantic
case,
they
got
into
trial
and
almost
through
trial
before
they
knew
there
was
maritime
question.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
in
the
briefs
of
his
employer,
he
was
paid
longshoreman
of
harbor
workers'
compensation
benefits
section
5
of
the
act
applied.
they
pled
it,
they
argued
into
their
briefs
and
under
the
halcyon
situation
where
the
employer
has
paid
his
compensation
under
the
federal
act,
there's
no
conflict
at
all.
the
employer
was
immune
from
contribution.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
first
of
all
i'm
not
urging
to
overrule.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
distinguished
very
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
oh
yes
sir.[laughter]
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
that
was
before
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
before
the
1972
amendment.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
we
rephrase
for
ryan
indemnity.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
why
--
we
would
be
immune.
just
sit
back
and
watch.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
i
doubt
about
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
sir,
they
went
into
effect
in
latter
part
of
november
1972.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
and
i
have
tried
a
number
of
cases,
since
the
act
was
amended
but
when
the
acts
did
not
happen
before
and
we
have
handled
all
the
way
through
under
the
old
ryan
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well
probably
not
but
possibly.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
that
is
right
justice
brennan.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
addressing
myself
back
to
justice
white's
question
that
in
contribution
the
general
theory
behind
it
is
that
joint
tortfeasors
opt
to
pay
their
part
of
the
wrong
that
they
caused
an
injury
to
somebody.
and
then
there
is
just
no
logical
reason
in
a
non-collision
maritime
situation
where
you
do
not
have
employer
involved
as
we
don't
have
here.
that
is
why
the
plaintiff
just
chooses
to
save
one
of
them,
why
they
cannot
sue
a
co-tortfeasor
waterman
and
then
divide
the
damages
or
as
they
approve
or
not.
i
just
do
not
think
it's
fair
or
just
or
equitable
that
you
have
--
and
particularly
where
you
have
contribution
in
so
many
other
areas
of
tort
law.
there
is
the
single
layout
maritime
law
and
just
say
we
won't
have
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
unlike
when
you
got
two
co-tortfeasors,
if
you
have
contribution
it
is
50/50
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
i
think
comparative
negligence
would
be
if
you
are
going
to
right
in
this
area,
i
am
like
comparative
negligence
would
be
the
more
equitable
way
to
do
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
the
divided
damages
rule
but
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no.
i
mentioned
the
divided
damages.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
well,
judge
singleton,
the
district
court
judge
said,
'i
am
going
to
find
you
both
equally
about
50/50.'
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
and
so
that's
what
he
did
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
the
way
you
have
both
damages
and
divide
it
by
half,
and
the
one
who
has
the
least
damage
pays
the
--
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes.
22
called
tortfeasor
(voice
overlap).
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
yes
50/50,
the
first
three
is
divided
to
tort.
this
case
can
be
far
reaching
one,
can
be
limited.
i
know
i
have
suggested
something
that
you
probably
did
not
expect,
but
i
think
that
give
this
consideration
and
at
least
your
honors,
please
affirm
this
case
as
to
contribution
in
any
way.
but
i
think
that
this
could
be
a
very
dynamic
case
and
handles
of
this
whole
area
of
law
if
you
take
one
step
further
or
at
least
give
it
some
consideration.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
justice
marshall,
you
will
not
be
amending
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
you
will
be
just
kind
of
dove-tailing
and
toggling
along
behind
it.
mr.
bruce
dixie
smith
no
sir,
just
doing
all
in
the
areas,
the
area
they
pointed
out
but
this
is
what
goes
that
far.
thank
you
very
much,
i
have
enjoyed
being
here.
