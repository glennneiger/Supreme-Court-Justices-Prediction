the

amendments

--

longshoremen’s
and

justice

today,
could
there
been
an
indemnity
action
against
whatever
it
is
called,
mid-gulf?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
affected
by
that,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
against
you,
but
not
against
mid-gulf?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
amended
law.
justice
potter
stewart
under
sieracki
and
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
but,
only
an
action
for
negligence
against
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
against
the
ship,
but
that’s
not
a
jones
act,
because
he
is
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
but
neither
of
those
amendments
affect
the
situation
here?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
vessel
was
found
to
be
negligent
in
addition
to
being
unseaworthy
and
also
because
cooper
stevedoring
is
not
the
employer
of
the
injured?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
we
still
have
the
same
problem
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
this
--
my
brother
rehnquist
has
just
suggested
that
the
inference
would
be
that
that's
precisely
what
congress
intended
when
they
looked
at
this
problem
in
1972
and
amended
the
act
and
cut
down
on
ryan
pro
tanto
to
the
extent
they
want
to
cut
down
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
all
together
unseaworthiness
only?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
ryan
indemnity
left
after
the
1972
amendment
except
against
the
non-employer,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
ryan
indemnity?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
may
or
may
not
be
unjust
or
it
may
or
it
may
have
not
been
criticized
by
the
commentators
and
so
on,
but
this
is
an
industry
and
at
least
i
have
heard
it
and
read
it
and
perhaps
even
written
it
many
times,
in
which
it
is
peculiarly
imbued
with
insurance
arrangements
and
the
important
thing
is
to
know
what
the
rules
are,
isn't
it
and
not
keep
changing
them
all
the
time.
even
though
the
rules
are
unsymmetrical
or
in
a
perfect
world
inequitable,
but
nonetheless
that
the
insurance
arrangements
are
made
and
it
is
important
that
there
be
certainty,
is
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
public
pays
the
bill
in
the
end
anyway
and
as
we
all
know
through
insurance,
and
if
the
arrangements
are
made
and
the
problem
is
handled,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
halcyon
and
ryan
had
been
on
the
books
a
long
time.
now
we
have
the
action
of
congress
in
1972
which
changed
the
rules
of
the
game
somewhat,
but
now
those
are
the
rules
of
game.
and
the
shipowners,
and
the
stevedores
and
so
on
should
be
able
to
make
their
arrangements
with
their
liability
insurers
accordingly,
shouldn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
saying,
we
are
indefinite,
as
i
say
we
all
agree
that
society
pays
for
these
entries
one
way
or
another?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
do
with
the
atlantic
case
incidentally?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
do
you
explain
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
against
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
by
the
time
the
case
came
here,
that
question
was
exposed
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
an
ordinary
tort
law
apart
from
maritime
tort
law
is
50/50,
isn't
it
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
if
they
are
both
called
tortfeasor.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
on
the
merits
of
contribution?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
ordinary
common
law,
in
your
common
law.
justice
