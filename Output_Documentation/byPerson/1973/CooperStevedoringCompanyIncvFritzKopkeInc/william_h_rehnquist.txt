has
to

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
now
he
no
longer
has
a
sieracki
--
justice
william

rehnquist
but
isn't
it
an
indemnitor
ordinarily
subrogated
to
the
rights
of
the
indemnity,
certainly
toward
common
law.
well,
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
maritime
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
subrogation
operates
without
regard
to
any
formal
assignment
just
by
a
virtue
of
having
paid
off
the
amount,
doesn't
it?
assume
the
obligation
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
reason
that
mid-gulf
paid
the
judgment
recovered
by
the
plaintiff,
was
it
because
it
was
the
insurance
carrier
of
the
stevedore
which
had
agreed
to
indemnify
the
vessel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
indication
in
connection
with
the
72
amendments
that
congress
was
mindful
of
halcyon
or
that
general
--
that
specific
area
of
maritime
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
all
that
different
from
the
insurance
company
of
the
defendant
and
the
personal
injury
crossing
accident.
as
you
would
file
--
(voice

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
they
did
not
see
in
so
many
words,
they
were
denying
it
because
the
statutory
immunity,
did
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here,
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do
is
to
completely
overrule
a
case
that
was
just
tailored
by
congress
two
years
ago?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
isn't
that
a
rather
strong
implication
that
congress
in
reviewing
this
situation
wanted
it
overruled
in
that
area,
but
left
standing
where
it
would
apply
otherwise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
say
it's
a
very
broad
thing
for
congress
to
do,
surely
it's
an
even
broader
thing
for
this
court
to
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
said
there
is
no
right
of
contribution
and
the
other
said
there's
an
absolute
right
to
--
absolute
liability
on
a
warranty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
a
collision
case,
all
he
would
have
had
to
find
was
some
fault
on
both
sides
then
it
would
be
an
automatic
50/50?
