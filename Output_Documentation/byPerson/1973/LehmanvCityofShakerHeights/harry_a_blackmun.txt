justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
by
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio.
it
involves
basically
the
right
of
a
candidate
for
political
office
to
command
advertising
space
in
car
cards
on
vehicles
of
public
transportation.
the
petitioner,
who
was
a
candidate
for
the
ohio
house
of
representatives,
was
refused
available
advertising
space
on
the
transit
system
of
the
city
of
shaker
heights,
a
cleveland
suburb.
he
brought
this
suit,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
municipal
policy
which
refuse
political
advertising
but
did
allow
other
types
of
public
transit
advertising.
the
state
courts
declined
to
give
the
petitioner
relief
and
the
ohio
supreme
court,
by
a
four-to-three
vote,
held
specifically
that
the
city’s
refusal
did
not
violate
a
candidate's
free
speech
or
equal
protection
rights.
we
affirm
that
judgment.
i
have
filed
a
plurality
opinion,
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
conclude
that
car
card
space
is
a
not
a
first
amendment
forum
and
that
a
city
may
exercise
some
discretion
with
respect
to
the
type
of
advertising
that
may
be
displayed
in
its
vehicles.
we
also
conclude
that
here
the
decision
to
limit
these
transit
advertisements
to
innocuous
and
less
controversial
commercial
and
service-oriented
advertising
serves
to
minimize
chances
of
abuse
or
the
appearance
of
political
favoritism
and
the
risk
of
imposing
upon
a
captive
audience,
and
that
this
involve
no
first
or
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
the
opinion
as
i
have
noted
is
a
plurality
one
only
but
not
a
majority
opinion.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concluding
that
the
petitioner,
although
free
to
express
his
views
to
a
willing
audience,
has
no
constitutional
right
to
force
his
message
upon
a
captive
audience
which
uses
public
transit
vehicles
as
a
means
of
transport,
not
as
a
place
for
discussion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
powell.
