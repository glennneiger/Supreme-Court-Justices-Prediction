ms.
joanne
condas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
brought
by
california
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court,
holding
unconstitutional
the
exclusion
of
section
2626
of
the
california
unemployment
insurance
code
which
excludes
pregnancy
from
coverage
under
the
disability
insurance
program.
the
cost
impact
of
this
decision
is
estimated
to
be
a
minimum
of
a
$120
million
annually,
based
on
the
current
level
of
operations
of
the
disability
funds.
and
the
question
we
present
to
this
court
is
whether
a
state
can
establish
a
disability
insurance
program
which
compensates
wage
loss
from
illness
and
injury
but
not
for
normal
pregnancy
without
violating
the
equal
protection
or
due
process
clauses
of
the
constitution,
when
there
is
neither
discriminatory
intent
in
the
creation
of
the
fund
nor
discriminatory
impact
in
its
operation.
in
order
for
the
court
to
understand
how
this
case
arises,
i
would
like
just
very
briefly
to
describe
how
the
fund
was
originated
and
developed.
in
1946,
california
became
the
second
state
to
adopt
a
disability
insurance
program.
this
arose
primarily
because
during
the
second
world
war,
enormous
surpluses
had
build
up
in
the
unemployment
insurance
fund
in
california
because
there
is
virtually
no
unemployment
during
the
war
years
and
the
governor
proposed
that
the
1%
which
employees
had
to
contribute
to
that
fund
should
be
shifted
to
provide
disability
insurance
instead.
and
the
governor
in
his
message
explained
why
he
thought
that
1%
should
be
the
figure
and
why,
since
it
was
coming
from
employees,
it
should
be
kept
low,
and
that
is
that
an
employer
can
always
pass
along
whatever
is
charged
to
him
in
terms
of
the
cost
of
doing
of
his
business
in
terms
of
providing
a
service
or
cost
of
goods
but
to
an
employee,
there
is
no
one
else
to
pass
the
charge
and
as
to
him
it
amounts
to
a
gross
income
tax.
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
of
course
that
there
is
no
employer
contribution
to
this
particular
fund,
that
was
an
illustrative
example
only.
well,
the
disability
insurance
program
has
been
financed
within
the
limits
of
that
1%
and
this
was
accomplished
primarily
as
a
result
of
incorporating
certain
features
in
the
california
plan
that
were
different
from
the
rhode
island
plan
which
was
the
only
model
that
california
had
to
go
by
at
that
time.
rhode
island
had
begun
paying
benefits
in
1943
and
by
1946,
in
the
middle
of
the
year,
they
had
gone
from
a
$2.7
billion
surplus
to
a
$1.5
million
deficit
and
there
were
primarily
two
factors,
omissions
really
from
the
rhode
island
plan
that
accounted
for
this
financial
problem.
the
first
was
that
they
had
not
provided
for
the
prevention
of
double
recovery,
it
was
possible
under
the
rhode
island
plan
to
recover
both
workman’s
compensation
disability
and
unemployment
disability
for
the
same
illness,
and
secondly,
they
had
included
pregnancy
coverage.
pregnancy
benefits
posed
a
larger
problem
for
rhode
island
and
really
amounted
to
more
than
twice
what
was
paid
for
the
workman’s
compensation
duplication.
the
california
plan
made
changes
in
both
of
those
features.
section
2629
of
the
california
unemployment
insurance
code
prevents
the
double
recovery
and
section
2626
excluded
pregnancy
until
28
days
after
determination
of
pregnancy.
now
the
reason
i
used
that
in
the
past
tense
is
that
last
year,
that
section
was
amended
and
it
now
provides
for
coverage
for
complications
for
pregnancy
instead
of
the
exclusion.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
would
you
like
an
explanation
of
the
five
states?
ms.
joanne
condas
yes
currently,
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
potential
problems
that
we
are
discussing
is
the
state
of
hawaii
and
hawaii,
in
may
amended
its
law
to
provide
coverage
for
pregnancy.
the
situation
there
is
that
premiums
for
men
employees
have
remained
$3.25
per
employee
per
month.
the
rate
for
women
was
always
a
little
higher
and
this
simply
is
standard
in
the
disability
insurance
field.
the
rate
for
women
was
$4.00
per
female
per
month.
ms.
joanne
condas
it’s
a
disability
insurance
premium
charge
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
but
a
certain
base
period
as
california
has
a
limitation
on
what
the
employee
can
be
charged.
hawaii
has
a
limitation
on
what
the
employee
can
be
charged
and
so
the
increase
in
cost
in
hawaii
will
be
picked
up
by
a
charge
to
employers
but
that
charge
is
enormous,
as
i
say
in
the
case
of
men
the
rate
has
not
changed.
it
is
$3.25
per
man
per
month.
for
a
woman,
it
has
gone
from
$4.00
per
woman
per
month
to
$8.76
per
woman
per
month
and
the
only
thing
that
has
changed
is
the
inclusion
of
pregnancy.
i
might
also
mention
that
new
jersey
provides
a
maximum
of
eight
weeks
of
benefits,
four
weeks
before
birth
and
four
weeks
after
birth,
that’s
the
maximum
and
the
new
jersey
experience
is
that
between
49
and
57%
of
its
fund
go
to
pay
for
pregnancy
benefits.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes,
i
beg
your
pardon.
rhode
island
of
course
was
the
first
state,
now
they
have
had
several
changes
in
their
law.
at
the
present
time,
they
provide
for
a
maximum
lump
sum
for
a
normal
pregnancy
of
$250.00
in
benefits.
california
now
covers
abnormalities
and
complications
of
pregnancy.
i
am
somewhat
uncertain
as
to
the
present
state
of
new
york
law.
their
law
excludes
pregnancy
but
their
human
rights
commission
has
required
employers
to
treat
pregnancy
for
all
disability
purposes
like
--
ms.
joanne
condas
yes
and
i
don’t
know
enough
about
the
details
of
the
plan,
to
know
just
what
financial
impact
that
has
ultimately.
well,
california
incorporated
the
features
that
it
could
from
rhode
island
in
order
to
enable
it
to
carry
out
an
essential
purpose
to
the
fund.
the
essential
purpose
to
the
california
disability
plan
is
to
provide
at
low
cost
a
fund
which
provides
benefits
having
significant
levels
of
benefits.
they’ve
always
been
a
fairly
healthy
wage
continuation
and
to
provide
broad
coverage,
to
help
as
many
employees
as
could
be
helped.
the
plan
pays
out
virtually
all
of
its
income
in
benefits.
in
the
past
five
years
for
example,
the
ratio
of
payout
to
benefits
has
been
90%
in
the
range
of
90%
of
income
to
103%
of
income.
the
plan
provides
for
comprehensive
benefits,
as
i
have
indicated
but
it
does
contain
actually
three
exclusions.
one
is,
and
they
are
all
based
on
the
inordinately
high
cost
of
providing
them,
based
on
actuarial
standards
common
in
the
insurance
industry.
the
first
is
the
short-term
disability.
unless
you
have
a
waiting
period
of
some
duration,
you
are
just
swamped
with
small
claims
so
there
is
an
exclusion
of
any
disability
which
are
less
than
eight
days.
ms.
joanne
condas
that’s
correct.
the
second
exclusion
is
the
disability
that
endures
more
than
26
weeks.
that
does
not
matter
whether
he
is
in
the
hospital
or
not,
that’s
simply
the
maximum
benefits
allowable
and
the
third
one
is
the
pregnancy
exclusion.
as
i
have
indicated,
the
experience
of
the
california
fund
is
much
like
that
of
the
disability
insurance
industry
generally.
it
soon
became
apparent
that
it
did
result
in
women
deriving
substantially
more
benefits
than
men.
this
results
primarily
because
we
do
have
the
flat
rate
and
so
when
you
have
a
situation
in
which
you
charge
people
a
flat
rate
and
you
have
the
standard
in
the
insurance
industry
that
women
file
more
disability
claims,
the
impact
of
that
is
that
women
derive
substantially
more
benefits
than
they
make
contributions.
ms.
joanne
condas
well,
it’s
a
flat
rate
of
1%,
yes.
ms.
joanne
condas
well
our
brief
includes
some
charts.
one
is
affixed
to
the
affidavit
of
an
actuary
named
william
smith,
that
was
not
an
employee
of
the
agency
here,
which
shows
that
the
claim
rate,
regardless
of
the
income
level,
the
claim
rate
is
higher
in
the
case
of
women.
ms.
joanne
condas
in
absolute
terms.
and
we
also
have
that
confirmed
by
figures
from
our
own
fund.
the
claim
rate
at
every
income
level
is
greater.
indeed,
we
discovered
recently
that
perhaps
the
highest
claim
filing
rate
of
all
is
women
who
make
in
excess
of
$10,000.
well,
that’s
the
background
of
the
fund.
background
of
this
litigation
is
that
there
were
two
suits,
one
brought
in
the
federal
district
court,
the
other
brought
in
the
california
supreme
court
by
petition
for
writ
of
mandate.
both
alleged
that
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy
amounted
to
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
since
the
california
court
had
already
ruled
on
the
constitutionality
of
its
statute,
in
a
case
called
clark
versus
california
employment
stabilization
commission,
the
cases
were
transferred
and
consolidated
in
federal
court,
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
the
matter
was
heard
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
point
from
the
california
case
because
i
think
it's
key
in
terms
of
what
we
see
as
the
rationale
for
exclusion
of
pregnancy.
in
the
clark
case,
the
state
court
said
that
the
legislature
was
entitled
to
consider
“whether
the
objects
of
the
statute
would
be
best
served
by
including
a
disability
benefit
which
reasonably
might
impose
upon
a
majority
of
employees,
a
burden
disproportionate
to
contemplated
benefits
in
order
to
favor
the
minority
who
are
included
within
the
classified
group.”
in
other
words,
the
court
was
concerned
that
the
pregnancy
benefits
would
result
in
a
disproportionate
amount
of
benefits
going
to
a
subgroup
and
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
in
other
states
and
it’s
exactly
what
we
predict
will
happen
in
california.
the
federal
court,
the
federal
three-judge
court
equated
the
classification
of
pregnancy
as
one
based
on
sex
and
held
that
it
denied
equal
protection
to
pregnant
women
and
also
held
that
pregnancy
benefits
could
not
be
excluded
simply
on
the
basis
of
cost.
as
we
have
indicated,
it
is
not
simply
cost.
it’s
the
combination
of
factors
that
make
up
the
california
plan.
cost,
the
broad
coverage
and
the
significant
level
of
benefits
that
it
is
desired
to
maintain.
ms.
joanne
condas
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
are
none
that
i
am
aware
of,
except
that,
for
example
in
the
case
of
a
diabetic
or
a
person
with
renal
failure
who
has
to
go
in
the
hospital
once
a
week
or
who
has
an
intermittent
disease.
in
effect,
his
disease
is
excluded
because
he
never
has
a
disability
period
that
goes
for
eight
days
but
he
may
be
critically
ill
and
get
no
disability
compensation
at
all.
ms.
joanne
condas
i
have
not
made
a
very
deep
study
of
private
plans,
i
know
that
there
are
various
combinations
of
exclusions
which
i
would
like
to
point
out,
are
generally
based
on
premium
cost.
i
think
perhaps
one
can
get
almost
any
kind
of
health
coverage
he
wants
on
a
private
insurance
basis,
provided
he
is
willing
to
pay
the
cost
of
obtaining
that
coverage
and
i
believe
that
--
ms.
joanne
condas
well
there
is
this
one
code
section
which
deals
with
dipsomania,
drug
addiction,
and
sexual
psychopaths.
ms.
joanne
condas
well,
except
that
it
requires
that
they
be
under
court
commitment
and
that
is
a
fairly
archaic
practice.
those
provisions
are
still
in
the
law
but
it
would
be
unrealistic
to
say
that
they
constitute
valid
exclusion.
ms.
joanne
condas
that
is
correct.
although
the
issue
in
all
of
the
briefs
has
been
discussed
in
terms
of
the
sex
limited
characteristic,
the
california
plan
covers
any
kind
of
sex
limited
disability
of
either
sex,
with
the
exception
of
pregnancy,
so
that
what
this
case
boils
down
to
is
the
question
of
what
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
compels
us
to
include
pregnancy
in
our
disability
insurance
plan.
we
say,
california
says
that
the
equal
protection
doesn’t
compel
it
because
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
another
class
similarly
situated
and
the
majority
below
acknowledged
that
pregnancy
is
unique
and
that
no
one
is
situated
similarly
to
a
pregnant
woman.
judge
williams
in
dissent
below
had
difficulty
finding
any
equal
protection
factors
involved
here
on
the
basis
that
women
derive
significantly
more
benefit
from
the
operation
of
the
program
than
men
do.
they
contribute
only
28%
of
the
withholdings
and
they
draw
38%
of
the
benefit
payments.
now
whether
you
wish
to
attribute
that
to
lower
pay
for
women
or
not,
it
is
apparent
that
there
is
no
desperate
impact
in
the
operation
of
this
fund
upon
women.
this
court
did
not
treat
the
pregnancy
question
before
it
recently,
in
chesterfield
board
of
education
versus
lafleur,
in
the
equal
protection
context.
it
rather
based
its
decision
on
due
process
considerations
and
that’s
a
test
that
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
here.
it’s
california’s
contention
that
we
have
a
valid
state
interest
in
maintaining
the
solvency
of
this
insurance
program
and
also
in
providing
comprehensive
benefits
to
the
maximum
number
of
workers
who
can
be
served.
this
court
has
said
that
in
the
area
of
economics
and
social
welfare
legislation
that
the
court
will
judge
the
relationship
of
the
means
and
ends
on
the
rational
basis
test.
now,
if
the
court
is
willing
to
do
that,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
five
factors
which
in
combination,
we
believe
amply
justify
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy.
certainly,
questions
could
be
raised
and
qualifications
made
on
anyone
of
these
factors
individually.
it’s
a
combination
of
factors
which
california
urges,
requires
the
exclusion.
the
first
is
the
relative
cost
factor.
the
second
is
that
the
condition
of
pregnancy
is
generally
voluntary
and
subject
to
planning.
the
third
is
that
pregnancy
disabilities
have
a
significantly
longer
duration.
the
fourth
is
that
treating
physicians
apply
a
different
medical
standard
and
finally
the
fifth,
that
there
is
a
major
difference
in
the
return
to
work
rate
following
disability
from
pregnancy.
first,
in
terms
of
the
relative
cost,
the
majority
of
the
three-judge
court
accepted
the
appellant's
estimate
that
pregnancy
benefits
would
add
40%
to
the
operation
of
this
plan.
it
simply
regarded
that
increase
as
irrelevant.
as
i
have
indicated,
the
experience
of
new
jersey
is
that
it
costs
even
more
than
that
in
terms
of
half
of
their
benefits,
approximately
going
to
pay
complications
and
benefits
of
one
category
of
disease.
this
cost
estimate
is
also
consistent
with
a
joint
statement
filed
with
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
on
february
11,
1974
by
the
health
insurance
association
of
america
and
the
american
life
assurance
association.
this
group
represents
500
insurance
companies
who
together
ride
90%
of
the
health
insurance
in
the
united
states
and
in
that
joint
statement,
they
indicate
that
for
an
employer
providing
a
typical
disability
income
plan,
this
is
not
just
medical
benefits
while
you
are
in
the
hospital,
this
is
the
income
protection
kind
of
plan
that
covering
pregnancy
would
add
between
40%
and
50%
to
the
cost.
i
have
already
given
you
the
impact
in
terms
of
what
it
has
done
to
hawaii.
i
would
also
note
with
regard
to
the
voluntariness
of
pregnancy
that
the
appellees
have
conceded
that
most
births
are
desired.
on
the
other
hand,
the
disability
fund
which
compensates
for
illness
and
injuries
involves
misfortunes
and
accidents
and
the
kind
of
thing,
disease
and
accident
are
the
kinds
of
things
which
no
one
ever
desires
and
because
of
that
basic
distinction
in
the
desirability
and
the
voluntariness
of
the
condition,
there
is
a
significantly
greater
incidence
of
planned
use
of
the
program.
while
it’s
true,
you
may
put
off
a
cataract
operation
until
next
year
so
that
to
that
extent
you
could
plan
the
timing.
you
certainly
cannot
plan
not
to
have
a
cataract
that
is
something
which
befalls
you.
ms.
joanne
condas
we
conducted
a
brief
study
which
indicates
that
this
is
truly
a
de
minimis
proposition.
ms.
joanne
condas
even
in
california,
at
least
during
the
three
months
which
were
surveyed,
november
through
february
of
this
past
period,
a
three-month
survey
was
made
of
all
disability
claims
and
it
was
found
that
0.12%
of
all
claims
filed
were
for
purely
cosmetic
surgery
and
85.5%
of
those
claims
were
filed
by
women.
ms.
joanne
condas
well,
these
were
claims
that
were
filed
so
they
would
have
to
be
either
for
hospitalization
benefits
in
which
there
is
not
the
seven-day
exclusion
or
for
disabilities
that
ran
into
the
eighth
day.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
only
claimant
alive
in
effect
is
mrs.
jaramillo
whose
claim
would
be
for
a
normal
pregnancy
disability.
i
should
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
there
is
remaining
to
me
for
rebuttal.
ms.
joanne
condas
i
should
like
to
respond
to
the
question
concerning
further
legislative
consideration
of
inclusion
of
pregnancy.
it’s
a
matter
that
comes
up
every
year
because
of
course,
the
legislature
is
always
confronted
with
the
request
to
reallocate
benefits
among
groups
different
ways
and
i
should
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
judge
william’s
discussion
in
his
dissent
from
the
opinion
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
22
and
23.
he
discusses
the
transmogrifications
that
senate
bill
419
went
through
and
there
were
statistical
presentations
made
to
the
senate
committees
that
considered
that
so
that
from
a
bill
which
began
by
offering
maternity
benefits
of
15
weeks
at
a
cost
increase
up
to
73%
in
the
premium,
the
bill
finally
emerged
in
the
form
of
one
treating
only
abnormal
and
involuntary
complications
of
pregnancy
and
i
would
also
like
to
respond
to
the
discussion
of
that
involuntary
terminations
or
involuntary
complications
and
why
that
word
is
used
in
the
existing
law.
there
is
still
a
good
deal
of
social
controversy
over
granting
a
woman
the
right
to
have
an
abortion,
must
the
public
pay
for
it
when
a
significant
segment
of
the
public
still
has
philosophical
objections
to
doing
so.
as
a
consequence,
the
bill
emerged
that
way
after
full
legislative
discussion
and
a
good
deal
of
interplay
among
interested
groups.
i
would
like
to
reiterate
the
five
factors
that
i
discussed
before
and
it
seems
to
me
in
a
way
that
what
i
am
talking
about
is
sort
of
like
the
blind
man
examining
an
elephant,
that
if
you
just
talk
about
the
voluntariness,
you
can
find
other
conditions
that
are
somewhat
voluntary
and
if
you
just
talk
about
the
duration,
you
can
find
other
conditions
that
have
long
duration.
and
if
you
just
talk
about
the
cost,
you
can
probably
find
others
that
somewhat
approached
the
cost
of
pregnancy.
but
if
you
take
all
of
those
five
factors
together
--
ms.
joanne
condas
i
beg
your
pardon?
well
the
--
alright,
the
difference
in
medical
standards
and
i
would
like
to
respond
particularly
to
the
statement
which
is
in
the
appellee’s
brief
concerning
the
position
of
the
american
physicians
and
gynecologists
on
this
point.
it
may
be
that
they
say
one
thing
in
one
context
and
they
do
another
thing
in
another
context.
for
example,
the
railroad
retirement
board
provides
full
pregnancy
benefits
for
disability
from
pregnancy
and
the
statistics
contained
in
the
report
of
the
railroad
retirement
board
covering
1970
and
1971
average
per
beneficiary
110
days
per
pregnancy.
now
those
are
all
based
again
on
medical
certification.
so
it’s
clear
that
doctors
are
willing
to
be
a
little
bit
more
generous
and
i
submit
to
you
that
one
of
the
reasons
is
it’s
not
unlike
what
professor
thomas
reed
powell
said
in
connection
with
having
a
legal
mind,
that
if
you
can
think
of
one
thing
and
not
think
of
the
other
thing
that’s
inextricably
interwoven
with
it,
then
you
have
a
legal
mind.
well,
i
believe
that’s
the
condition
that
a
physician
is
in,
in
treating
a
mother
with
a
newborn
child
and
in
that
respect.
let
me
call
to
your
attention
the
brief,
the
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
the
physician’s
forum
and
at
page
2
of
that
brief,
in
discussing
why
they
have
an
interest
in
this
case,
they
say
three
times,
the
health
of
the
perspective
mother
and
child,
the
health
of
working
women
and
their
children,
and
the
health
of
the
women
or
the
fetus,
all
are
reasons
why
the
disability
of
pregnancy
should
be
included.
well,
i
think
that’s
just
a
fairly
clear
indication
that
doctors
have
in
conservative
medical
judgments
quite
proper
concern
for
the
mother
and
the
newborn
child
together
and
they
are
simply
not
going
to
be
able
to
sort
out.
the
mother
is
not
disabled
but
the
newborn
baby
would
be
better
off
if
she
were
with
it.
i
just
believe
that’s
not
going
to
happen.
i
should
also
like
to
comment
that
california
has
always
had
a
concern
about
the
higher
cost
of
covering
women
under
disability.
there
is
no
dearth
of
legislative
history
here,
there
has
been
in
the
regulations
from
almost
the
very
beginning,
a
restriction
that
relates
to
private
plans
which
were
a
significantly
greater
factor
in
earlier
days
and
that
regulation
which
is
in
the
california
administrative
code
title
22
section
3254
(h)
require
that
private
plans
include
at
least
20%
women
and
it
was
obviously
perhaps
an
in
artful
but
it
was
certainly
an
effort
to
require
that
funds
have
some
balance
to
compensate
for
the
fact
that
women
simply
cost
more
to
cover
under
disability
plans.
herbert
dennenberg,
commissioner
of
insurance
at
the
state
of
pennsylvania
who
is
no
friend
of
the
insurance
industry
has
consistently
acknowledged
that
it
costs
between
two
and
three
times
the
same
amount
to
cover
women
as
it
does
men
without
covering
pregnancy.
but
finally,
i
would
just
to
leave
this
one
thought,
that
we
are
not
talking
about
adding
a
new
class
of
beneficiaries.
there
is
not
a
single
woman
who
would
be
brought
into
the
class
of
beneficiaries
who
is
not
there
now.
every
woman
who
is
eligible
for
disability
insurance
in
california
is
getting
disability
insurance
coverage.
the
result
of
this
decision
would
be
to
skew
that
benefit
package
so
that
a
small
percentage
of
the
women
get
the
lion
share
of
the
benefits
and
when
our
state
court
had
this
question
before
it
in
1958,
that
was
exactly
the
problem
that
they
foresaw
and
exactly
why
they
felt
it
was
a
legislative
decision
to
decide
how
to
treat
pregnancy,
whether
to
exclude
it
entirely,
to
put
a
long
durational
requirement
which
is
all
they
did
in
the
beginning
to
extend
the
durational
requirement
or
simply
to
compensate
complications
of
pregnancy.
that
was
a
decision
that
the
legislature
made
and
has
consistently
reexamined
with
legislative
bills
that
come
up
just
about
every
year
and
it
just
seems
to
me
to
be
almost
inconceivable
that
we
could
allow
this
disproportion
to
grow
larger.
i
submit
that
if
pregnancy
is
required
to
be
covered,
we
can
expect
that
approximately
2%
of
the
workforce
in
california
will
collect
more
than
30%
of
the
benefits
and
this
is
arrived
at
very
simply.
it
is
established
that
approximately
5%
of
the
women
in
the
workforce
become
pregnant
each
year
and
even
if
you
were
to
assume
that
the
workforce
is
made
up
of
50%
women.
ms.
joanne
condas
in
which
it
is
not,
but
let
us
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument.
you
then
have
a
condition
where
you
know
what
the
pregnancy
benefits
are
going
to
be,
they
are
going
to
be
an
admitted
30
to
40%
increase
in
the
cost
so
you
have
whatever
small
percentage
of
women
who
become
pregnant
each
year,
taking
down
a
total
of
30%
of
the
added
cost
of
the
administration
of
the
fund
and
i
submit
that
to
do
that
under
the
guides
of
equal
protection
or
due
process
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
surprising
result.
for
that
reason,
california
urges
that
the
district
court
decision
be
reversed.
ms.
joanne
condas
i
will
be
happy
to.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
relative
cost,
there
is
no
question
the
majority
below
accepted
our
estimate.
they
simply
said
we
could
not
exclude
it
simply
because
it
was
a
high
cost
item.
every
state,
every
private
plan
has
had
the
same
experience
with
the
high
cost
of
pregnancy
coverage.
there
is
also
the
factor
that
because
it
is
a
voluntary
condition
and
because
it
is
a
desired
condition,
conceded
to
be
desired
condition
by
the
appellees
that
it
lends
itself
to
planned
use
as
illnesses
and
accidents
do
not.
that
thirdly
it
has
a
longer
duration.
in
california,
the
average
duration
of
disability
is
eight
weeks
and
that
includes
those
which
go
well
beyond
the
26
weeks
and
exhaust
their
benefits.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes,
yes
it
is.
the
different
medical
standard,
which
necessarily
pertains,
we
don’t
believe
that
that’s
a
matter
of
fraud
and
collusion.
we
believe
it’s
a
matter
of
sound
medical
judgment
in
the
interest
of
the
mother
and
child.
a
physician
in
that
area
of
medical
practice
would
be
remised
not
to
take
that
into
account
and
also
the
rate
of
return
to
work
following
pregnancy.
since
we
have
not
covered
pregnancy,
we
admittedly
have
no
statistics
of
our
own
on
that
point.
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
filed
by
the
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company
and
by
general
electric
company
in
this
case
indicate
that
their
experience
is
approximately
a
50%
rate
of
return.
ms.
joanne
condas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
brought
by
california
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court,
holding
unconstitutional
the
exclusion
of
section
2626
of
the
california
unemployment
insurance
code
which
excludes
pregnancy
from
coverage
under
the
disability
insurance
program.
the
cost
impact
of
this
decision
is
estimated
to
be
a
minimum
of
a
$120
million
annually,
based
on
the
current
level
of
operations
of
the
disability
funds.
and
the
question
we
present
to
this
court
is
whether
a
state
can
establish
a
disability
insurance
program
which
compensates
wage
loss
from
illness
and
injury
but
not
for
normal
pregnancy
without
violating
the
equal
protection
or
due
process
clauses
of
the
constitution,
when
there
is
neither
discriminatory
intent
in
the
creation
of
the
fund
nor
discriminatory
impact
in
its
operation.
in
order
for
the
court
to
understand
how
this
case
arises,
i
would
like
just
very
briefly
to
describe
how
the
fund
was
originated
and
developed.
in
1946,
california
became
the
second
state
to
adopt
a
disability
insurance
program.
this
arose
primarily
because
during
the
second
world
war,
enormous
surpluses
had
build
up
in
the
unemployment
insurance
fund
in
california
because
there
is
virtually
no
unemployment
during
the
war
years
and
the
governor
proposed
that
the
1%
which
employees
had
to
contribute
to
that
fund
should
be
shifted
to
provide
disability
insurance
instead.
and
the
governor
in
his
message
explained
why
he
thought
that
1%
should
be
the
figure
and
why,
since
it
was
coming
from
employees,
it
should
be
kept
low,
and
that
is
that
an
employer
can
always
pass
along
whatever
is
charged
to
him
in
terms
of
the
cost
of
doing
of
his
business
in
terms
of
providing
a
service
or
cost
of
goods
but
to
an
employee,
there
is
no
one
else
to
pass
the
charge
and
as
to
him
it
amounts
to
a
gross
income
tax.
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
of
course
that
there
is
no
employer
contribution
to
this
particular
fund,
that
was
an
illustrative
example
only.
well,
the
disability
insurance
program
has
been
financed
within
the
limits
of
that
1%
and
this
was
accomplished
primarily
as
a
result
of
incorporating
certain
features
in
the
california
plan
that
were
different
from
the
rhode
island
plan
which
was
the
only
model
that
california
had
to
go
by
at
that
time.
rhode
island
had
begun
paying
benefits
in
1943
and
by
1946,
in
the
middle
of
the
year,
they
had
gone
from
a
$2.7
billion
surplus
to
a
$1.5
million
deficit
and
there
were
primarily
two
factors,
omissions
really
from
the
rhode
island
plan
that
accounted
for
this
financial
problem.
the
first
was
that
they
had
not
provided
for
the
prevention
of
double
recovery,
it
was
possible
under
the
rhode
island
plan
to
recover
both
workman’s
compensation
disability
and
unemployment
disability
for
the
same
illness,
and
secondly,
they
had
included
pregnancy
coverage.
pregnancy
benefits
posed
a
larger
problem
for
rhode
island
and
really
amounted
to
more
than
twice
what
was
paid
for
the
workman’s
compensation
duplication.
the
california
plan
made
changes
in
both
of
those
features.
section
2629
of
the
california
unemployment
insurance
code
prevents
the
double
recovery
and
section
2626
excluded
pregnancy
until
28
days
after
determination
of
pregnancy.
now
the
reason
i
used
that
in
the
past
tense
is
that
last
year,
that
section
was
amended
and
it
now
provides
for
coverage
for
complications
for
pregnancy
instead
of
the
exclusion.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
would
you
like
an
explanation
of
the
five
states?
ms.
joanne
condas
yes
currently,
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
potential
problems
that
we
are
discussing
is
the
state
of
hawaii
and
hawaii,
in
may
amended
its
law
to
provide
coverage
for
pregnancy.
the
situation
there
is
that
premiums
for
men
employees
have
remained
$3.25
per
employee
per
month.
the
rate
for
women
was
always
a
little
higher
and
this
simply
is
standard
in
the
disability
insurance
field.
the
rate
for
women
was
$4.00
per
female
per
month.
ms.
joanne
condas
it’s
a
disability
insurance
premium
charge
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
but
a
certain
base
period
as
california
has
a
limitation
on
what
the
employee
can
be
charged.
hawaii
has
a
limitation
on
what
the
employee
can
be
charged
and
so
the
increase
in
cost
in
hawaii
will
be
picked
up
by
a
charge
to
employers
but
that
charge
is
enormous,
as
i
say
in
the
case
of
men
the
rate
has
not
changed.
it
is
$3.25
per
man
per
month.
for
a
woman,
it
has
gone
from
$4.00
per
woman
per
month
to
$8.76
per
woman
per
month
and
the
only
thing
that
has
changed
is
the
inclusion
of
pregnancy.
i
might
also
mention
that
new
jersey
provides
a
maximum
of
eight
weeks
of
benefits,
four
weeks
before
birth
and
four
weeks
after
birth,
that’s
the
maximum
and
the
new
jersey
experience
is
that
between
49
and
57%
of
its
fund
go
to
pay
for
pregnancy
benefits.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes,
i
beg
your
pardon.
rhode
island
of
course
was
the
first
state,
now
they
have
had
several
changes
in
their
law.
at
the
present
time,
they
provide
for
a
maximum
lump
sum
for
a
normal
pregnancy
of
$250.00
in
benefits.
california
now
covers
abnormalities
and
complications
of
pregnancy.
i
am
somewhat
uncertain
as
to
the
present
state
of
new
york
law.
their
law
excludes
pregnancy
but
their
human
rights
commission
has
required
employers
to
treat
pregnancy
for
all
disability
purposes
like
--
ms.
joanne
condas
yes
and
i
don’t
know
enough
about
the
details
of
the
plan,
to
know
just
what
financial
impact
that
has
ultimately.
well,
california
incorporated
the
features
that
it
could
from
rhode
island
in
order
to
enable
it
to
carry
out
an
essential
purpose
to
the
fund.
the
essential
purpose
to
the
california
disability
plan
is
to
provide
at
low
cost
a
fund
which
provides
benefits
having
significant
levels
of
benefits.
they’ve
always
been
a
fairly
healthy
wage
continuation
and
to
provide
broad
coverage,
to
help
as
many
employees
as
could
be
helped.
the
plan
pays
out
virtually
all
of
its
income
in
benefits.
in
the
past
five
years
for
example,
the
ratio
of
payout
to
benefits
has
been
90%
in
the
range
of
90%
of
income
to
103%
of
income.
the
plan
provides
for
comprehensive
benefits,
as
i
have
indicated
but
it
does
contain
actually
three
exclusions.
one
is,
and
they
are
all
based
on
the
inordinately
high
cost
of
providing
them,
based
on
actuarial
standards
common
in
the
insurance
industry.
the
first
is
the
short-term
disability.
unless
you
have
a
waiting
period
of
some
duration,
you
are
just
swamped
with
small
claims
so
there
is
an
exclusion
of
any
disability
which
are
less
than
eight
days.
ms.
joanne
condas
that’s
correct.
the
second
exclusion
is
the
disability
that
endures
more
than
26
weeks.
that
does
not
matter
whether
he
is
in
the
hospital
or
not,
that’s
simply
the
maximum
benefits
allowable
and
the
third
one
is
the
pregnancy
exclusion.
as
i
have
indicated,
the
experience
of
the
california
fund
is
much
like
that
of
the
disability
insurance
industry
generally.
it
soon
became
apparent
that
it
did
result
in
women
deriving
substantially
more
benefits
than
men.
this
results
primarily
because
we
do
have
the
flat
rate
and
so
when
you
have
a
situation
in
which
you
charge
people
a
flat
rate
and
you
have
the
standard
in
the
insurance
industry
that
women
file
more
disability
claims,
the
impact
of
that
is
that
women
derive
substantially
more
benefits
than
they
make
contributions.
ms.
joanne
condas
well,
it’s
a
flat
rate
of
1%,
yes.
ms.
joanne
condas
well
our
brief
includes
some
charts.
one
is
affixed
to
the
affidavit
of
an
actuary
named
william
smith,
that
was
not
an
employee
of
the
agency
here,
which
shows
that
the
claim
rate,
regardless
of
the
income
level,
the
claim
rate
is
higher
in
the
case
of
women.
ms.
joanne
condas
in
absolute
terms.
and
we
also
have
that
confirmed
by
figures
from
our
own
fund.
the
claim
rate
at
every
income
level
is
greater.
indeed,
we
discovered
recently
that
perhaps
the
highest
claim
filing
rate
of
all
is
women
who
make
in
excess
of
$10,000.
well,
that’s
the
background
of
the
fund.
background
of
this
litigation
is
that
there
were
two
suits,
one
brought
in
the
federal
district
court,
the
other
brought
in
the
california
supreme
court
by
petition
for
writ
of
mandate.
both
alleged
that
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy
amounted
to
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
since
the
california
court
had
already
ruled
on
the
constitutionality
of
its
statute,
in
a
case
called
clark
versus
california
employment
stabilization
commission,
the
cases
were
transferred
and
consolidated
in
federal
court,
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
the
matter
was
heard
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
point
from
the
california
case
because
i
think
it's
key
in
terms
of
what
we
see
as
the
rationale
for
exclusion
of
pregnancy.
in
the
clark
case,
the
state
court
said
that
the
legislature
was
entitled
to
consider
“whether
the
objects
of
the
statute
would
be
best
served
by
including
a
disability
benefit
which
reasonably
might
impose
upon
a
majority
of
employees,
a
burden
disproportionate
to
contemplated
benefits
in
order
to
favor
the
minority
who
are
included
within
the
classified
group.”
in
other
words,
the
court
was
concerned
that
the
pregnancy
benefits
would
result
in
a
disproportionate
amount
of
benefits
going
to
a
subgroup
and
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
in
other
states
and
it’s
exactly
what
we
predict
will
happen
in
california.
the
federal
court,
the
federal
three-judge
court
equated
the
classification
of
pregnancy
as
one
based
on
sex
and
held
that
it
denied
equal
protection
to
pregnant
women
and
also
held
that
pregnancy
benefits
could
not
be
excluded
simply
on
the
basis
of
cost.
as
we
have
indicated,
it
is
not
simply
cost.
it’s
the
combination
of
factors
that
make
up
the
california
plan.
cost,
the
broad
coverage
and
the
significant
level
of
benefits
that
it
is
desired
to
maintain.
ms.
joanne
condas
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
are
none
that
i
am
aware
of,
except
that,
for
example
in
the
case
of
a
diabetic
or
a
person
with
renal
failure
who
has
to
go
in
the
hospital
once
a
week
or
who
has
an
intermittent
disease.
in
effect,
his
disease
is
excluded
because
he
never
has
a
disability
period
that
goes
for
eight
days
but
he
may
be
critically
ill
and
get
no
disability
compensation
at
all.
ms.
joanne
condas
i
have
not
made
a
very
deep
study
of
private
plans,
i
know
that
there
are
various
combinations
of
exclusions
which
i
would
like
to
point
out,
are
generally
based
on
premium
cost.
i
think
perhaps
one
can
get
almost
any
kind
of
health
coverage
he
wants
on
a
private
insurance
basis,
provided
he
is
willing
to
pay
the
cost
of
obtaining
that
coverage
and
i
believe
that
--
ms.
joanne
condas
well
there
is
this
one
code
section
which
deals
with
dipsomania,
drug
addiction,
and
sexual
psychopaths.
ms.
joanne
condas
well,
except
that
it
requires
that
they
be
under
court
commitment
and
that
is
a
fairly
archaic
practice.
those
provisions
are
still
in
the
law
but
it
would
be
unrealistic
to
say
that
they
constitute
valid
exclusion.
ms.
joanne
condas
that
is
correct.
although
the
issue
in
all
of
the
briefs
has
been
discussed
in
terms
of
the
sex
limited
characteristic,
the
california
plan
covers
any
kind
of
sex
limited
disability
of
either
sex,
with
the
exception
of
pregnancy,
so
that
what
this
case
boils
down
to
is
the
question
of
what
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
compels
us
to
include
pregnancy
in
our
disability
insurance
plan.
we
say,
california
says
that
the
equal
protection
doesn’t
compel
it
because
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
another
class
similarly
situated
and
the
majority
below
acknowledged
that
pregnancy
is
unique
and
that
no
one
is
situated
similarly
to
a
pregnant
woman.
judge
williams
in
dissent
below
had
difficulty
finding
any
equal
protection
factors
involved
here
on
the
basis
that
women
derive
significantly
more
benefit
from
the
operation
of
the
program
than
men
do.
they
contribute
only
28%
of
the
withholdings
and
they
draw
38%
of
the
benefit
payments.
now
whether
you
wish
to
attribute
that
to
lower
pay
for
women
or
not,
it
is
apparent
that
there
is
no
desperate
impact
in
the
operation
of
this
fund
upon
women.
this
court
did
not
treat
the
pregnancy
question
before
it
recently,
in
chesterfield
board
of
education
versus
lafleur,
in
the
equal
protection
context.
it
rather
based
its
decision
on
due
process
considerations
and
that’s
a
test
that
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
here.
it’s
california’s
contention
that
we
have
a
valid
state
interest
in
maintaining
the
solvency
of
this
insurance
program
and
also
in
providing
comprehensive
benefits
to
the
maximum
number
of
workers
who
can
be
served.
this
court
has
said
that
in
the
area
of
economics
and
social
welfare
legislation
that
the
court
will
judge
the
relationship
of
the
means
and
ends
on
the
rational
basis
test.
now,
if
the
court
is
willing
to
do
that,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
five
factors
which
in
combination,
we
believe
amply
justify
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy.
certainly,
questions
could
be
raised
and
qualifications
made
on
anyone
of
these
factors
individually.
it’s
a
combination
of
factors
which
california
urges,
requires
the
exclusion.
the
first
is
the
relative
cost
factor.
the
second
is
that
the
condition
of
pregnancy
is
generally
voluntary
and
subject
to
planning.
the
third
is
that
pregnancy
disabilities
have
a
significantly
longer
duration.
the
fourth
is
that
treating
physicians
apply
a
different
medical
standard
and
finally
the
fifth,
that
there
is
a
major
difference
in
the
return
to
work
rate
following
disability
from
pregnancy.
first,
in
terms
of
the
relative
cost,
the
majority
of
the
three-judge
court
accepted
the
appellant's
estimate
that
pregnancy
benefits
would
add
40%
to
the
operation
of
this
plan.
it
simply
regarded
that
increase
as
irrelevant.
as
i
have
indicated,
the
experience
of
new
jersey
is
that
it
costs
even
more
than
that
in
terms
of
half
of
their
benefits,
approximately
going
to
pay
complications
and
benefits
of
one
category
of
disease.
this
cost
estimate
is
also
consistent
with
a
joint
statement
filed
with
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
on
february
11,
1974
by
the
health
insurance
association
of
america
and
the
american
life
assurance
association.
this
group
represents
500
insurance
companies
who
together
ride
90%
of
the
health
insurance
in
the
united
states
and
in
that
joint
statement,
they
indicate
that
for
an
employer
providing
a
typical
disability
income
plan,
this
is
not
just
medical
benefits
while
you
are
in
the
hospital,
this
is
the
income
protection
kind
of
plan
that
covering
pregnancy
would
add
between
40%
and
50%
to
the
cost.
i
have
already
given
you
the
impact
in
terms
of
what
it
has
done
to
hawaii.
i
would
also
note
with
regard
to
the
voluntariness
of
pregnancy
that
the
appellees
have
conceded
that
most
births
are
desired.
on
the
other
hand,
the
disability
fund
which
compensates
for
illness
and
injuries
involves
misfortunes
and
accidents
and
the
kind
of
thing,
disease
and
accident
are
the
kinds
of
things
which
no
one
ever
desires
and
because
of
that
basic
distinction
in
the
desirability
and
the
voluntariness
of
the
condition,
there
is
a
significantly
greater
incidence
of
planned
use
of
the
program.
while
it’s
true,
you
may
put
off
a
cataract
operation
until
next
year
so
that
to
that
extent
you
could
plan
the
timing.
you
certainly
cannot
plan
not
to
have
a
cataract
that
is
something
which
befalls
you.
ms.
joanne
condas
we
conducted
a
brief
study
which
indicates
that
this
is
truly
a
de
minimis
proposition.
ms.
joanne
condas
even
in
california,
at
least
during
the
three
months
which
were
surveyed,
november
through
february
of
this
past
period,
a
three-month
survey
was
made
of
all
disability
claims
and
it
was
found
that
0.12%
of
all
claims
filed
were
for
purely
cosmetic
surgery
and
85.5%
of
those
claims
were
filed
by
women.
ms.
joanne
condas
well,
these
were
claims
that
were
filed
so
they
would
have
to
be
either
for
hospitalization
benefits
in
which
there
is
not
the
seven-day
exclusion
or
for
disabilities
that
ran
into
the
eighth
day.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
only
claimant
alive
in
effect
is
mrs.
jaramillo
whose
claim
would
be
for
a
normal
pregnancy
disability.
i
should
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
there
is
remaining
to
me
for
rebuttal.
ms.
joanne
condas
i
should
like
to
respond
to
the
question
concerning
further
legislative
consideration
of
inclusion
of
pregnancy.
it’s
a
matter
that
comes
up
every
year
because
of
course,
the
legislature
is
always
confronted
with
the
request
to
reallocate
benefits
among
groups
different
ways
and
i
should
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
judge
william’s
discussion
in
his
dissent
from
the
opinion
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
22
and
23.
he
discusses
the
transmogrifications
that
senate
bill
419
went
through
and
there
were
statistical
presentations
made
to
the
senate
committees
that
considered
that
so
that
from
a
bill
which
began
by
offering
maternity
benefits
of
15
weeks
at
a
cost
increase
up
to
73%
in
the
premium,
the
bill
finally
emerged
in
the
form
of
one
treating
only
abnormal
and
involuntary
complications
of
pregnancy
and
i
would
also
like
to
respond
to
the
discussion
of
that
involuntary
terminations
or
involuntary
complications
and
why
that
word
is
used
in
the
existing
law.
there
is
still
a
good
deal
of
social
controversy
over
granting
a
woman
the
right
to
have
an
abortion,
must
the
public
pay
for
it
when
a
significant
segment
of
the
public
still
has
philosophical
objections
to
doing
so.
as
a
consequence,
the
bill
emerged
that
way
after
full
legislative
discussion
and
a
good
deal
of
interplay
among
interested
groups.
i
would
like
to
reiterate
the
five
factors
that
i
discussed
before
and
it
seems
to
me
in
a
way
that
what
i
am
talking
about
is
sort
of
like
the
blind
man
examining
an
elephant,
that
if
you
just
talk
about
the
voluntariness,
you
can
find
other
conditions
that
are
somewhat
voluntary
and
if
you
just
talk
about
the
duration,
you
can
find
other
conditions
that
have
long
duration.
and
if
you
just
talk
about
the
cost,
you
can
probably
find
others
that
somewhat
approached
the
cost
of
pregnancy.
but
if
you
take
all
of
those
five
factors
together
--
ms.
joanne
condas
i
beg
your
pardon?
well
the
--
alright,
the
difference
in
medical
standards
and
i
would
like
to
respond
particularly
to
the
statement
which
is
in
the
appellee’s
brief
concerning
the
position
of
the
american
physicians
and
gynecologists
on
this
point.
it
may
be
that
they
say
one
thing
in
one
context
and
they
do
another
thing
in
another
context.
for
example,
the
railroad
retirement
board
provides
full
pregnancy
benefits
for
disability
from
pregnancy
and
the
statistics
contained
in
the
report
of
the
railroad
retirement
board
covering
1970
and
1971
average
per
beneficiary
110
days
per
pregnancy.
now
those
are
all
based
again
on
medical
certification.
so
it’s
clear
that
doctors
are
willing
to
be
a
little
bit
more
generous
and
i
submit
to
you
that
one
of
the
reasons
is
it’s
not
unlike
what
professor
thomas
reed
powell
said
in
connection
with
having
a
legal
mind,
that
if
you
can
think
of
one
thing
and
not
think
of
the
other
thing
that’s
inextricably
interwoven
with
it,
then
you
have
a
legal
mind.
well,
i
believe
that’s
the
condition
that
a
physician
is
in,
in
treating
a
mother
with
a
newborn
child
and
in
that
respect.
let
me
call
to
your
attention
the
brief,
the
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
the
physician’s
forum
and
at
page
2
of
that
brief,
in
discussing
why
they
have
an
interest
in
this
case,
they
say
three
times,
the
health
of
the
perspective
mother
and
child,
the
health
of
working
women
and
their
children,
and
the
health
of
the
women
or
the
fetus,
all
are
reasons
why
the
disability
of
pregnancy
should
be
included.
well,
i
think
that’s
just
a
fairly
clear
indication
that
doctors
have
in
conservative
medical
judgments
quite
proper
concern
for
the
mother
and
the
newborn
child
together
and
they
are
simply
not
going
to
be
able
to
sort
out.
the
mother
is
not
disabled
but
the
newborn
baby
would
be
better
off
if
she
were
with
it.
i
just
believe
that’s
not
going
to
happen.
i
should
also
like
to
comment
that
california
has
always
had
a
concern
about
the
higher
cost
of
covering
women
under
disability.
there
is
no
dearth
of
legislative
history
here,
there
has
been
in
the
regulations
from
almost
the
very
beginning,
a
restriction
that
relates
to
private
plans
which
were
a
significantly
greater
factor
in
earlier
days
and
that
regulation
which
is
in
the
california
administrative
code
title
22
section
3254
(h)
require
that
private
plans
include
at
least
20%
women
and
it
was
obviously
perhaps
an
in
artful
but
it
was
certainly
an
effort
to
require
that
funds
have
some
balance
to
compensate
for
the
fact
that
women
simply
cost
more
to
cover
under
disability
plans.
herbert
dennenberg,
commissioner
of
insurance
at
the
state
of
pennsylvania
who
is
no
friend
of
the
insurance
industry
has
consistently
acknowledged
that
it
costs
between
two
and
three
times
the
same
amount
to
cover
women
as
it
does
men
without
covering
pregnancy.
but
finally,
i
would
just
to
leave
this
one
thought,
that
we
are
not
talking
about
adding
a
new
class
of
beneficiaries.
there
is
not
a
single
woman
who
would
be
brought
into
the
class
of
beneficiaries
who
is
not
there
now.
every
woman
who
is
eligible
for
disability
insurance
in
california
is
getting
disability
insurance
coverage.
the
result
of
this
decision
would
be
to
skew
that
benefit
package
so
that
a
small
percentage
of
the
women
get
the
lion
share
of
the
benefits
and
when
our
state
court
had
this
question
before
it
in
1958,
that
was
exactly
the
problem
that
they
foresaw
and
exactly
why
they
felt
it
was
a
legislative
decision
to
decide
how
to
treat
pregnancy,
whether
to
exclude
it
entirely,
to
put
a
long
durational
requirement
which
is
all
they
did
in
the
beginning
to
extend
the
durational
requirement
or
simply
to
compensate
complications
of
pregnancy.
that
was
a
decision
that
the
legislature
made
and
has
consistently
reexamined
with
legislative
bills
that
come
up
just
about
every
year
and
it
just
seems
to
me
to
be
almost
inconceivable
that
we
could
allow
this
disproportion
to
grow
larger.
i
submit
that
if
pregnancy
is
required
to
be
covered,
we
can
expect
that
approximately
2%
of
the
workforce
in
california
will
collect
more
than
30%
of
the
benefits
and
this
is
arrived
at
very
simply.
it
is
established
that
approximately
5%
of
the
women
in
the
workforce
become
pregnant
each
year
and
even
if
you
were
to
assume
that
the
workforce
is
made
up
of
50%
women.
ms.
joanne
condas
in
which
it
is
not,
but
let
us
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument.
you
then
have
a
condition
where
you
know
what
the
pregnancy
benefits
are
going
to
be,
they
are
going
to
be
an
admitted
30
to
40%
increase
in
the
cost
so
you
have
whatever
small
percentage
of
women
who
become
pregnant
each
year,
taking
down
a
total
of
30%
of
the
added
cost
of
the
administration
of
the
fund
and
i
submit
that
to
do
that
under
the
guides
of
equal
protection
or
due
process
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
surprising
result.
for
that
reason,
california
urges
that
the
district
court
decision
be
reversed.
ms.
joanne
condas
i
will
be
happy
to.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
relative
cost,
there
is
no
question
the
majority
below
accepted
our
estimate.
they
simply
said
we
could
not
exclude
it
simply
because
it
was
a
high
cost
item.
every
state,
every
private
plan
has
had
the
same
experience
with
the
high
cost
of
pregnancy
coverage.
there
is
also
the
factor
that
because
it
is
a
voluntary
condition
and
because
it
is
a
desired
condition,
conceded
to
be
desired
condition
by
the
appellees
that
it
lends
itself
to
planned
use
as
illnesses
and
accidents
do
not.
that
thirdly
it
has
a
longer
duration.
in
california,
the
average
duration
of
disability
is
eight
weeks
and
that
includes
those
which
go
well
beyond
the
26
weeks
and
exhaust
their
benefits.
ms.
joanne
condas
yes,
yes
it
is.
the
different
medical
standard,
which
necessarily
pertains,
we
don’t
believe
that
that’s
a
matter
of
fraud
and
collusion.
we
believe
it’s
a
matter
of
sound
medical
judgment
in
the
interest
of
the
mother
and
child.
a
physician
in
that
area
of
medical
practice
would
be
remised
not
to
take
that
into
account
and
also
the
rate
of
return
to
work
following
pregnancy.
since
we
have
not
covered
pregnancy,
we
admittedly
have
no
statistics
of
our
own
on
that
point.
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
filed
by
the
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company
and
by
general
electric
company
in
this
case
indicate
that
their
experience
is
approximately
a
50%
rate
of
return.
