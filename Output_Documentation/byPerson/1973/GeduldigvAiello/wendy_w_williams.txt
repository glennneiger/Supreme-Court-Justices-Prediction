ms.
wendy
w.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
as
appellant
states
whether
women
should
receive
benefits
for
normal
pregnancy
under
california’s
disability
insurance
program.
we
do
not
and
could
not
contend
that
pregnancy
itself
is
a
medical
disability.
rather,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
denial
of
benefits
to
otherwise
qualified
workers
is
justified
solely
because
their
illness
or
injury
arises
from
normal
pregnancy
and
child
birth.
the
purpose
of
the
california
disability
program
is
to
compensate
in
part
for
wage
loss
because
of
sickness
or
injury
and
to
reduce
to
a
minimum
the
suffering
caused
by
the
resulting
unemployment.
in
carrying
out
the
program’s
liberal
purposes,
california
compensates
every
conceivable
disability
without
regard
to
its
voluntariness,
uniqueness,
predictability
or
cost.
thus,
the
program
compensates
workers
disabled
by
costly
disabilities
such
as
heart
attacks,
sex
and
race
unique
disabilities
such
as
prostatectomies
or
sickle
cell
anemia;
voluntary
disability
such
as
cosmetic
surgery,
sterilization
or
orthodonture
and
pre-existing
conditions
which
will
inevitably
result
in
disability
such
as
degenerative
arthritis
or
cataract
operations.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
sole
exclusion
under
the
program
is
the
exclusion
for
pregnancy
and
birth-related
disabilities.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
there
is
some
question
under
the
new
statute
whether
it
does
or
does
not
cover
abortions.
apparently,
as
i
read
that
statute,
it
covers
non-voluntary
abortions,
medically-indicated
abortions
but
does
not
cover
voluntary
abortions.
that
raises
an
interesting
point
which
is
that
when
a
woman
chooses
to
have
a
child
and
she
is
a
california
worker
or
when
she
chooses
to
have
an
abortion
and
she
is
a
california
worker,
she
is
not
covered
in
either
case
by
the
california
program
and
i
think
this
raises
some
question
under
the
recent
roe
and
doe
decisions
of
this
court.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
could
you
clarify
the
question?
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
as
i
understand
the
roe
opinion,
it’s
a
doctor’s
decision
or
maybe
--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
primary
point
here
is
that
the
only
group
chosen
to
bear
the
burden
of
an
exclusion
under
the
fund
is
a
group
whose
choice,
with
respect
to
pregnancy
is
a
protected
one.
whether
the
person
chooses
to
terminate
the
pregnancy
or
carry
the
pregnancy
out.
under
the
california
program,
she
uniquely
bears
the
burden
of
an
exclusion
from
a
program
that
assists
every
other
worker
who
might
be
disabled.
the
sole
criterion
for
granting
benefits
for
any
of
the
disabilities
that
i
just
mentioned
that
are
covered
by
the
program
is
whether
the
worker
is
medically
disabled.
women
disabled
by
childbirth
meet
this
medical
criterion
and
like
other
workers,
suffer
from
the
attendant
wage
loss.
given
that
this
disabled
class
of
women
is
similarly
situated
with
respect
to
the
program's
stated
major
purposes,
we
might
ask
whether
scrutiny
of
the
program
structure
and
operation
reveals
unstated
but
no
less
clear
evidence
of
legislative
purposes
which
would
explain
this
singular
exclusion.
quite
plainly
they
do
not.
california
has
created
a
wholly
pooled
risk
program.
workers
contribute
a
flat
percentage
of
their
income
to
the
fund
and
benefits
are
paid
according
to
a
statutory
scale
based
on
wages.
the
california
program
excludes
no
adverse
risk
groups
and
in
fact
prohibits
groups
of
low
risk
workers
from,
belonging
to
separate
plants
at
lower
cost.
rather
than
categorized
workers
on
the
basis
of
actuarial
factors,
california
has
chosen
to
pool
high
and
low
risk
workers
in
one
comprehensive
fund.
age
and
income
level,
two
of
the
most
accurate
predictors
of
disability
risk
according
to
california’s
own
and
national
statistics,
are
irrelevant
to
an
individual
worker’s
contribution
rate
or
eligibility
for
benefits.
california
does
not
even
compile
statistics
on
disability
experienced
by
race,
although
national
health
survey
statistics
published
by
hew
indicate
that
the
gap
between
disability
days
on
the
basis
of
race
is
significantly
greater
than
that
based
on
sex.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
yes,
as
i
understand
it
there
are
now
lawsuits
in
the
new
york
area
challenging
the
application
of
an
actuarial
basis
as
between
men
and
women
in
the
granting
of
insurance
benefits.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
minimally
it
would
face
lawsuits.
what
the
conclusion
of
those
might
be
i
could
not
say.
under
a
pooled
risk
system,
none
of
the
actuarial
considerations
arise
that
would
be
relevant
there.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
well
that
really
brings
me
to
my
next
point.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
and
then--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
men
per
se
do
not
pay
in
more
and
get
out
less.
that
is
not
the
predictive
factor
under
the
program.
the
first
and
major
predictive
factor
is
of
course
wage
level,
the
california
program
is
structured
so
as
to
benefit
low
wage
earners
at
a
disproportionate
rate
to
high
wage
earners
so
that
a
low
wage
earner
would
receive
a
65%
wage
replacement
whereas
a
high
income
wage
earner
would
receive
approximately
55%
wage
replacement.
for
this
reason,
the
difference
in
the
income
level
between
men
and
women
explains
almost
totally
the
difference
in
contributions
received
from
the
fund,
in
the
benefits
paid
by
the
fund.
there
is
an
additional
factor
however
that
i
would
mention
since
the
state
has
put
considerable
emphasis
on
it
and
that
is
that
wage
level
aside,
women
suffer
a
far
larger
number
of
disabilities
than
men
do.
this
is
simply
not
borne
out
by
the
facts,
the
state’s
own
facts
or
any
others,
the
actual
difference
in
the
disability
rate
is
in
california,
that
women
receive
44%
of
the
benefits
and
they
are
40%
of
the
workforce.
i
am
sorry,
let
me
correct
that,
they
filed
44%
of
the
claims
and
they
are
40%
of
the
workforce.
in
addition,
the
average
duration
for
disabilities
between
men
and
women
is
approximately
the
same.
now,
i
think
that
the
other
factor
that
is
important
in
determining
whether
sex
is
the
predictive
factor
is
to
look
at
the
disability
rates
of
persons
at
different
income
levels
and
there
again
we
find
that
the
low
wage
earners
have
a
higher
disability
rate
and
of
course
women
are
among
the
low
income
group
and
consequently
do
suffer
a
higher
disability
rate.
now,
what
this
all
amounts
to,
is
that
sex
is
not
the
primary
predictive
factor
here.
the
primary
predictive
factor,
in
both
respects
that
i
mentioned
is
the
wage
level
and
for
california
to
urge
that
women
receive
a
disproportionate
amount
of
the
funds
is
another
example
of
using
the
sex
of
women
against
them
when
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
benefits
they
receive
or
the
contributions
they
make.
now,
appellant’s
main
contention,
as
i
understand
it
and
really
sole
contention
is
that
the
cost
of
coverage
of
child
birth
related
disabilities
is
just
so
extraordinarily
expensive
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
maintain
a
program
supported
by
employee
contributions
if
these
disabilities
were
included.
as
the
district
court
found,
even
using
appellant’s
estimate
of
cost,
it
is
clear
that
including
these
disabilities
would
not
destroy
the
fund.
the
legislature
could
accommodate
these
costs
quite
easily
by
making
reasonable
changes
in
the
contribution
rate,
the
maximum
benefits
allowable
or
other
factors
affecting
the
solvency
of
the
fund.
even
by
appellant’s
own
estimate,
the
difference
that
any
individual
worker
would
have
to
pay
per
month
to
the
fund
amounts
to
$2.00
under
our
estimate
which
is
about
half
as
large,
that
amount
would
be
$1.00
in
addition
per
month.
now,
the
primary
factor
which
accounts
for
the
difference
in
our
estimate
of
the
cost
of
this
particular
disability
is
the
duration
estimated
by
the
appellants
as
compared
to
the
estimate
of
duration
which
we
derived
from
common
medical
understanding.
a
conservative
estimate
made
by
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
is
that
the
disability
resulting
from
child
birth
will
average
six
to
eight
weeks.
this
is
approximately
half
of
the
duration
estimated
by
the
appellant.
in
fact,
many
of
the
doctors
surveyed
by
appellant
in
the
survey
which
he
attaches
to
his
primary
brief
estimate
that
the
average
duration
of
disability
is
less
than
six
weeks.
we
don’t
ask
this
court
to
make
a
finding
of
the
average
number
of
weeks
of
disability
due
to
child
birth,
we
simply
point
out
that
doctors
almost
uniformly
agree
that
the
average
is
at
most
half
of
the
estimate
of
the
appellant.
in
a
12-hour
attempt
to
justify
its
cost
estimates,
appellant
attaches
as
appendix
b
to
his
brief,
a
chart
purporting
to
show
that
one
half
of
new
jersey’s
benefit
payments
are
paid
for
pregnancy
related
disabilities.
because
these
figures
so
distorts
the
actual
situation
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
appellees
would
request
the
opportunity
to
submit
within
ten
days
a
short
explanation
of
the
true
facts
when
they
can
be
gathered.
briefly
explained,
the
figure
submitted
by
appellant
are
misrepresentative
because
they
show
benefit
payments
under
only
one
of
new
jersey’s
three
separate
disability
funds.
the
fund
mentioned
or
shown
in
the
chart
attached
to
the
reply
brief
is
the
disability
during
unemployment
fund
which
pays
out
only
10%
or
so
of
all
benefits
but
almost
all
pregnancy
claims.
employers
commonly
lay
off
pregnant
women
some
weeks
prior
to
disability
in
that
state,
thereby
necessitating
their
claims
go
under
this
unemployment
fund.
new
jersey’s
total
experience
is
that
child
birth
related
benefits
comprise
only
8%
or
9%
of
total
program
benefits,
according
to
the
figures
which
we’ve
been
able
to
derive
and
will
submit
to
the
court
within
ten
days.
in
the
final
analysis,
the
exclusion
of
birth
related
disabilities
is
solely
a
matter
of
cost
as
i
have
indicated
before.
the
meager
legislative
history
available
to
us
suggests
no
other
basis.
the
california
legislature
which
enacted
the
program
in
1946
looked
to
and
learned
from
the
only
state
disability
program
then
in
existence,
the
rhode
island
program
created
four
years
earlier.
rhode
island’s
program,
in
its
early
years
had
severe
financial
problems
which
california
sought
to
avoid.
one
major
drain
on
the
rhode
island
program’s
funds
was
the
cost
of
paying
benefits
for
pregnancy.
the
major
reason
for
this
high
cost
was
the
fact
that
rhode
island
paid
benefits
to
a
woman
simply
because
she
was
pregnant
without
requiring
a
showing
of
actual
physical
disability.
california,
rather
than
control
for
this
over
generous
interpretation
of
pregnancy
related
disability
excluded
such
disabilities
from
the
fund
all
together.
the
desire
to
save
money
cannot
justify
and
otherwise
invidious
classification.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson,
this
court
confronted
the
determination
of
congress
in
at
least
40
states
that
public
money
should
not
be
spent
on
welfare
aid
to
new
residents.
the
primary
reason
for
that
one
year
residency
requirement
was
the
legislature’s
desire
to
save
welfare
cost.
this
court
held
that
the
constitution
required
inclusion
of
the
class
deliberately
excluded
by
the
legislature.
significantly
although
this
court
closely
scrutinized
the
classification
in
shapiro
it
indicated
that
the
one
year
residence
requirement
was
vulnerable
even
under
the
traditional,
more
lenient
rational
basis
standard
of
equal
protection
review.
similarly,
both
in
reed
v.
reed,
404
u.s.
and
frontiero
at
411
u.s.,
considerations
of
economy
were
rejected
as
a
basis
for
discriminating
against
women.
indeed
--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
i
believe
you
are
referring
to
footnote
6
in
shapiro
--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
that
footnote
states
that
a
state
disability
program
would
be
entitled
to
tie
benefits
to
contribution
rate
which
california
now
does
by
its
flat
1%
rate.
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
our
position
here.
indeed
to
permit
differential
treatment
on
the
basis
of
sex
solely
because
the
state
wishes
to
save
money
when
perhaps
the
most
pervasive
form
of
discrimination
against
women
is
economic,
is
to
perpetuate
the
historical
discrimination
against
them.
equality
for
women,
as
equality
for
black
persons
has
done
and
will
continue
to
do,
cost
money
as
the
experience
under
title
vii
in
the
equal
pay
act
demonstrate.
nowhere
is
the
economic
discrimination
against
women
more
apparent
than
in
the
rules
and
practices
surrounding
the
reality
that
women
are
the
bearers
of
children.
this
role
which
calls
for
stereotyped
notions
that
women
belong
in
the
home
with
their
children
that
women
are
not
serious
members
of
the
workforce
and
that
women
generally
have
a
male
breadwinner
in
their
families
to
support
them
has
resulted
in
laws
which
force
able
bodied
women
off
the
job
which
denies
them
unemployment
insurance
once
they
have
gone
on
mandatory
maternity
leave,
denies
them
sick
leave
when
their
disability
results
from
pregnancy
and
disability
insurance
as
well
which
does
not
permit
them
to
return
to
work
at
the
time
when
they
become
physically
able,
often
denies
them
seniority
and
other
benefits
which
accrue
to
workers
normally
disabled
and
finally
when
they
try
to
return
to
the
job,
often
the
jobs
themselves
are
denied.
in
light
of
these
realities,
judge
hainsworth’s
conclusion
in
cohen
versus
chesterfield
county
school
board
474
f.
2d
that,
“the
fact
that
only
women
experience
pregnancy
and
motherhood
removes
all
possibility
of
competition
in
this
area
is
simply
false.
rather,
women
who
become
pregnant
suffer
a
serious
competitive
disadvantage
not
because
their
physiological
state
renders
it
inevitable
and
unavoidable
but
because
of
over
broad
and
arbitrary
rules
concerning
that
physiological
state.”
an
example
of
the
kind
of
discriminatory
notions
upon
which
the
state
is
focused
and
made
its
arguments
are
two
examples.
one
of
the
kind
i
just
mentioned
and
another
kind
which
i
will
describe.
the
first
is
that
the
reason
for
the
15-week
duration
is
that
women
will
have
to
go
on
mandatory
maternity
leave
before
they
are
physically
disabled
and
the
doctors
will
provide
for
compensation
during
that
time.
the
second
is
that
doctors,
being
sympathetic
people,
will
take
into
consideration
grounds
other
than
medical
grounds
in
determining
whether
a
woman
continues
to
be
disabled.
this
first
ground,
or
rather
both
grounds
assume
that
doctors
will
not
make
medical
judgments
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
woman
is
physically
disabled
because
of
child
birth.
i
think
there’s
no
basis
for
that
and
in
fact
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
mentioned
in
the
roe
opinion,
doctors
are
a
group
likely
to
carry
out
their
professional
responsibilities.
there
may
well
be
problems
at
first
in
california,
as
there
were
in
rhode
island,
in
educating
people
as
to
what
a
disability
related
to
pregnancy
is
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
the
state
itself
has
shown
confusion
between
childbearing
leave
and
disability
leave
and
it
may
be
that
doctors
will
have
to
be
informed
as
to
what’s
expected
of
them
in
submitting
disability
verifications,
that
doctors
will
collude
with
women
in
order
to
get
them
benefits
which
they
don’t
deserve,
i
think
is
contrary
to
reality
however.
now,
it
has
been
said
that
disability,
that
discrimination
based
upon
pregnancy
should
not
be
considered
to
be
sex
discrimination
for
several
reasons,
the
main
one
being
that
women
are
not
in
competition
with
men
in
this
area
and
in
addition,
that
it
is
a
unique
characteristic
and
those
arguments
are
related.
it’s
only
true
that
pregnancy
is
unique
and
there
is
no
competition
in
situations
in
which
the
law
is
narrowly
and
carefully
drawn
so
that
the
purposes
are
so
stated
that
all
that
could
possibly
be
covered
in
that
situation
as
pregnancy
and
pregnancy
exclusions
would
not
be
irrationally
categorized.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
a
law
which
said
that
a
woman
was
entitled
to
nursing
leave
after
the
birth
of
a
child
would
be
a
rational
statute.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
only
mothers
can
nurse
children.
if
it
was
a
leave
which
said
mothers
can
take
time
off
to
care
for
their
children
after
birth,
that
may
well
discriminate
against
fathers
who
are
perfectly
capable
of
taking
care
of
their
children
in
ways
other
than
nursing.
most
of
the
laws
which
we
have
discussed
here
today
and
which
are
exemplified
by
the
practice
struck
down
in
cohen
and
lafleur
however,
affect
women
in
an
area
where
they
truly
do
compete
with
men
and
put
them
in
a
serious
disadvantage,
not
just
at
the
time
that
they
go
out
of
the
workforce
but
sometimes
in
terms
of
their
whole
working
lives.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
should
be
considered
sex
discrimination.
historically,
we
have
seen
in
cases
like
bradwell,
in
cases
like
muller,
in
cases
like
hoyt,
the
very
justification
for
the
discrimination
against
women
in
those
cases
was
primarily
based
on
their
childbearing
function
and
the
role
which
was
assumed
to
grow
out
of
that
function.
now
as
time
has
gone
on,
these
generalized
discriminations
based
on
pregnancy,
which
for
example
kept
women
out
of
the
legal
profession
for
a
number
of
years
have
gradually
been
struck
down.
but
what
remains
is
the
narrow
area
in
which
these
unique
sex
characteristics
prevent
women
from
full
participation
in
the
labor
force
not
because
of
their
physical
state
but
because
of
rules
which
exclude
them.
now
in
frontiero
versus
laird,
the
plurality
in
that
case
stated
that
the
reason
for
scrutinizing
sex
based
classifications
in
part
was
that
stereotypes
and
generalizations
had
so
grown
up
around
the
status
of
women
that
laws
often
discriminated
against
them,
not
on
any
real
factors,
but
because
of
these
stereotypes.
pregnancy
presents
a
primary
example
of
that.
women
are
thought
of
on
the
one
hand
as
completely
disabled
during
the
whole
pregnancy
and
in
the
next
moment
the
state
can
assert
that
women
are
not
disabled
at
all
and
should
be
excluded
from
a
disability
program.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
they
have
said
that
normal
pregnancy,
the
pregnancy
is
a
normal
physiological
function
and
it
does
not
give
rise
to
illnesses
or
injuries.
i
think
this
is
clearly
contrary
to
fact.
any
common
medical
test
will
indicate
that
when
a
woman
goes
through
the
birth
process,
her
entire
birth
canal
is
to
some
extent
damaged
by
her
giving
birth
that
when
the
child
emerges,
she
often
has
a
surgical
procedure
called
an
episiotomy
which
is
disabling
to
her
for
some
period
of
time.
interestingly
enough
the
state
will
compensate
if
the
child
is
delivered
through
a
surgical
incision
in
the
abdomen
but
will
not
do
so
when
there
is
a
surgical
incision
at
the
end
of
the
birth
canal,
that
women
suffer
disabilities
for
other
physical
reasons
such
as
a
change
in
their
hormone
level
immediately
following
birth
is
also
clear
and
well-established
in
the
medical
text.
the
centrality
of
women’s
biological
reproductive
role
to
historical
and
current
discrimination
against
women
on
the
basis
of
sex
stereotypes
concerning
that
role
leads
to
the
inescapable
conclusion,
so
long
as
classifications
based
upon
pregnancy
are
thrust
outside
the
bounds
of
judicial
scrutiny.
so
long
will
women
suffer
unwarranted
and
arbitrary
discrimination
because
they
are
women.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
yes,
we
do.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
she
has
not
been
paid
disability
benefits.
the
aspirations
of
women
are
inextricably
linked
to
fair
and
realistic
treatment
of
pregnancy
in
the
public
sector.
this
case
presents
one
example
of
a
situation
where
mythology
overcomes
rationality
as
to
the
duration
of
the
disability,
as
to
the
nature
of
the
disability,
and
as
to
the
nature
of
the
woman’s
participation
in
the
workforce.
we
agree
with
appellant
that
pregnancy
is
not
a
disability.
at
the
same
time,
it
does
give
rise
in
certain
situation
to
verifiable
medical
disabilities.
in
a
program
that
compensates
for
work
loss
due
to
every
conceivable
disability,
normal,
voluntary,
unique
to
one
sex,
expensive,
frequent
or
whatever
consideration,
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy
related
disabilities
unconstitutionally
discriminates
against
women.
we
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
we
do
believe
that
this
is
gender
discrimination
but
we
also
believe
that
the
classification
here
is
totally
irrational
under
the
stated
purposes
and
operation
of
the
program.
ms.
condas
gives
as
--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
well,
in
this
particular
case
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
matter
of
being
ingenious.
i
think
it’s
a
matter
of
seeing
whether
there
is
a
fair
and
substantial
relationship
between
the
differences
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
program
and
it
does
not
exist
here.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
no,
it
would
not.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
no,
it
would
not.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
will
do
that.
these
statistics
which
came
in
on
the
reply
brief
are
statistics
that
we
have
never
seen
before
and
came
into
the
record
very
late
and
we
would
like
the
opportunity
to
respond.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
it
recently
of
course
considered
complications
of
pregnancy
in
the
passage
of
the
bill.
to
my
knowledge,
it
has
not
been
directly
requested
by
anyone
that
i
know
of
but
i
would
have
no
reason
to
know
to
change
its
law.
there
have
been
no
bills
forthcoming
on
this
subject
recently.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
i
believe
so,
yes.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
terms
of
the
interest
of
the
workers
in
this
case
which
i
believe
goes
to
your
point,
the
california
workers
appear
to
be
in
support
of
this
suit,
at
least
a
large
proportion
of
them.
a
number
of
labor
unions
are
parties
to
this
lawsuit,
both
originally
and
as
interveners
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
to
them
at
least,
the
1%
contribution
rate
that
the
state
argues
is
so
important
to
the
concept
of
the
program
is
not
so
important
to
them
that
it
could
not
be
somewhat
altered
to
cover
this
kind
of
disability.
thank
you.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
as
appellant
states
whether
women
should
receive
benefits
for
normal
pregnancy
under
california’s
disability
insurance
program.
we
do
not
and
could
not
contend
that
pregnancy
itself
is
a
medical
disability.
rather,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
denial
of
benefits
to
otherwise
qualified
workers
is
justified
solely
because
their
illness
or
injury
arises
from
normal
pregnancy
and
child
birth.
the
purpose
of
the
california
disability
program
is
to
compensate
in
part
for
wage
loss
because
of
sickness
or
injury
and
to
reduce
to
a
minimum
the
suffering
caused
by
the
resulting
unemployment.
in
carrying
out
the
program’s
liberal
purposes,
california
compensates
every
conceivable
disability
without
regard
to
its
voluntariness,
uniqueness,
predictability
or
cost.
thus,
the
program
compensates
workers
disabled
by
costly
disabilities
such
as
heart
attacks,
sex
and
race
unique
disabilities
such
as
prostatectomies
or
sickle
cell
anemia;
voluntary
disability
such
as
cosmetic
surgery,
sterilization
or
orthodonture
and
pre-existing
conditions
which
will
inevitably
result
in
disability
such
as
degenerative
arthritis
or
cataract
operations.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
sole
exclusion
under
the
program
is
the
exclusion
for
pregnancy
and
birth-related
disabilities.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
there
is
some
question
under
the
new
statute
whether
it
does
or
does
not
cover
abortions.
apparently,
as
i
read
that
statute,
it
covers
non-voluntary
abortions,
medically-indicated
abortions
but
does
not
cover
voluntary
abortions.
that
raises
an
interesting
point
which
is
that
when
a
woman
chooses
to
have
a
child
and
she
is
a
california
worker
or
when
she
chooses
to
have
an
abortion
and
she
is
a
california
worker,
she
is
not
covered
in
either
case
by
the
california
program
and
i
think
this
raises
some
question
under
the
recent
roe
and
doe
decisions
of
this
court.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
could
you
clarify
the
question?
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
as
i
understand
the
roe
opinion,
it’s
a
doctor’s
decision
or
maybe
--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
primary
point
here
is
that
the
only
group
chosen
to
bear
the
burden
of
an
exclusion
under
the
fund
is
a
group
whose
choice,
with
respect
to
pregnancy
is
a
protected
one.
whether
the
person
chooses
to
terminate
the
pregnancy
or
carry
the
pregnancy
out.
under
the
california
program,
she
uniquely
bears
the
burden
of
an
exclusion
from
a
program
that
assists
every
other
worker
who
might
be
disabled.
the
sole
criterion
for
granting
benefits
for
any
of
the
disabilities
that
i
just
mentioned
that
are
covered
by
the
program
is
whether
the
worker
is
medically
disabled.
women
disabled
by
childbirth
meet
this
medical
criterion
and
like
other
workers,
suffer
from
the
attendant
wage
loss.
given
that
this
disabled
class
of
women
is
similarly
situated
with
respect
to
the
program's
stated
major
purposes,
we
might
ask
whether
scrutiny
of
the
program
structure
and
operation
reveals
unstated
but
no
less
clear
evidence
of
legislative
purposes
which
would
explain
this
singular
exclusion.
quite
plainly
they
do
not.
california
has
created
a
wholly
pooled
risk
program.
workers
contribute
a
flat
percentage
of
their
income
to
the
fund
and
benefits
are
paid
according
to
a
statutory
scale
based
on
wages.
the
california
program
excludes
no
adverse
risk
groups
and
in
fact
prohibits
groups
of
low
risk
workers
from,
belonging
to
separate
plants
at
lower
cost.
rather
than
categorized
workers
on
the
basis
of
actuarial
factors,
california
has
chosen
to
pool
high
and
low
risk
workers
in
one
comprehensive
fund.
age
and
income
level,
two
of
the
most
accurate
predictors
of
disability
risk
according
to
california’s
own
and
national
statistics,
are
irrelevant
to
an
individual
worker’s
contribution
rate
or
eligibility
for
benefits.
california
does
not
even
compile
statistics
on
disability
experienced
by
race,
although
national
health
survey
statistics
published
by
hew
indicate
that
the
gap
between
disability
days
on
the
basis
of
race
is
significantly
greater
than
that
based
on
sex.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
yes,
as
i
understand
it
there
are
now
lawsuits
in
the
new
york
area
challenging
the
application
of
an
actuarial
basis
as
between
men
and
women
in
the
granting
of
insurance
benefits.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
minimally
it
would
face
lawsuits.
what
the
conclusion
of
those
might
be
i
could
not
say.
under
a
pooled
risk
system,
none
of
the
actuarial
considerations
arise
that
would
be
relevant
there.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
well
that
really
brings
me
to
my
next
point.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
and
then--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
men
per
se
do
not
pay
in
more
and
get
out
less.
that
is
not
the
predictive
factor
under
the
program.
the
first
and
major
predictive
factor
is
of
course
wage
level,
the
california
program
is
structured
so
as
to
benefit
low
wage
earners
at
a
disproportionate
rate
to
high
wage
earners
so
that
a
low
wage
earner
would
receive
a
65%
wage
replacement
whereas
a
high
income
wage
earner
would
receive
approximately
55%
wage
replacement.
for
this
reason,
the
difference
in
the
income
level
between
men
and
women
explains
almost
totally
the
difference
in
contributions
received
from
the
fund,
in
the
benefits
paid
by
the
fund.
there
is
an
additional
factor
however
that
i
would
mention
since
the
state
has
put
considerable
emphasis
on
it
and
that
is
that
wage
level
aside,
women
suffer
a
far
larger
number
of
disabilities
than
men
do.
this
is
simply
not
borne
out
by
the
facts,
the
state’s
own
facts
or
any
others,
the
actual
difference
in
the
disability
rate
is
in
california,
that
women
receive
44%
of
the
benefits
and
they
are
40%
of
the
workforce.
i
am
sorry,
let
me
correct
that,
they
filed
44%
of
the
claims
and
they
are
40%
of
the
workforce.
in
addition,
the
average
duration
for
disabilities
between
men
and
women
is
approximately
the
same.
now,
i
think
that
the
other
factor
that
is
important
in
determining
whether
sex
is
the
predictive
factor
is
to
look
at
the
disability
rates
of
persons
at
different
income
levels
and
there
again
we
find
that
the
low
wage
earners
have
a
higher
disability
rate
and
of
course
women
are
among
the
low
income
group
and
consequently
do
suffer
a
higher
disability
rate.
now,
what
this
all
amounts
to,
is
that
sex
is
not
the
primary
predictive
factor
here.
the
primary
predictive
factor,
in
both
respects
that
i
mentioned
is
the
wage
level
and
for
california
to
urge
that
women
receive
a
disproportionate
amount
of
the
funds
is
another
example
of
using
the
sex
of
women
against
them
when
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
benefits
they
receive
or
the
contributions
they
make.
now,
appellant’s
main
contention,
as
i
understand
it
and
really
sole
contention
is
that
the
cost
of
coverage
of
child
birth
related
disabilities
is
just
so
extraordinarily
expensive
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
maintain
a
program
supported
by
employee
contributions
if
these
disabilities
were
included.
as
the
district
court
found,
even
using
appellant’s
estimate
of
cost,
it
is
clear
that
including
these
disabilities
would
not
destroy
the
fund.
the
legislature
could
accommodate
these
costs
quite
easily
by
making
reasonable
changes
in
the
contribution
rate,
the
maximum
benefits
allowable
or
other
factors
affecting
the
solvency
of
the
fund.
even
by
appellant’s
own
estimate,
the
difference
that
any
individual
worker
would
have
to
pay
per
month
to
the
fund
amounts
to
$2.00
under
our
estimate
which
is
about
half
as
large,
that
amount
would
be
$1.00
in
addition
per
month.
now,
the
primary
factor
which
accounts
for
the
difference
in
our
estimate
of
the
cost
of
this
particular
disability
is
the
duration
estimated
by
the
appellants
as
compared
to
the
estimate
of
duration
which
we
derived
from
common
medical
understanding.
a
conservative
estimate
made
by
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
is
that
the
disability
resulting
from
child
birth
will
average
six
to
eight
weeks.
this
is
approximately
half
of
the
duration
estimated
by
the
appellant.
in
fact,
many
of
the
doctors
surveyed
by
appellant
in
the
survey
which
he
attaches
to
his
primary
brief
estimate
that
the
average
duration
of
disability
is
less
than
six
weeks.
we
don’t
ask
this
court
to
make
a
finding
of
the
average
number
of
weeks
of
disability
due
to
child
birth,
we
simply
point
out
that
doctors
almost
uniformly
agree
that
the
average
is
at
most
half
of
the
estimate
of
the
appellant.
in
a
12-hour
attempt
to
justify
its
cost
estimates,
appellant
attaches
as
appendix
b
to
his
brief,
a
chart
purporting
to
show
that
one
half
of
new
jersey’s
benefit
payments
are
paid
for
pregnancy
related
disabilities.
because
these
figures
so
distorts
the
actual
situation
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
appellees
would
request
the
opportunity
to
submit
within
ten
days
a
short
explanation
of
the
true
facts
when
they
can
be
gathered.
briefly
explained,
the
figure
submitted
by
appellant
are
misrepresentative
because
they
show
benefit
payments
under
only
one
of
new
jersey’s
three
separate
disability
funds.
the
fund
mentioned
or
shown
in
the
chart
attached
to
the
reply
brief
is
the
disability
during
unemployment
fund
which
pays
out
only
10%
or
so
of
all
benefits
but
almost
all
pregnancy
claims.
employers
commonly
lay
off
pregnant
women
some
weeks
prior
to
disability
in
that
state,
thereby
necessitating
their
claims
go
under
this
unemployment
fund.
new
jersey’s
total
experience
is
that
child
birth
related
benefits
comprise
only
8%
or
9%
of
total
program
benefits,
according
to
the
figures
which
we’ve
been
able
to
derive
and
will
submit
to
the
court
within
ten
days.
in
the
final
analysis,
the
exclusion
of
birth
related
disabilities
is
solely
a
matter
of
cost
as
i
have
indicated
before.
the
meager
legislative
history
available
to
us
suggests
no
other
basis.
the
california
legislature
which
enacted
the
program
in
1946
looked
to
and
learned
from
the
only
state
disability
program
then
in
existence,
the
rhode
island
program
created
four
years
earlier.
rhode
island’s
program,
in
its
early
years
had
severe
financial
problems
which
california
sought
to
avoid.
one
major
drain
on
the
rhode
island
program’s
funds
was
the
cost
of
paying
benefits
for
pregnancy.
the
major
reason
for
this
high
cost
was
the
fact
that
rhode
island
paid
benefits
to
a
woman
simply
because
she
was
pregnant
without
requiring
a
showing
of
actual
physical
disability.
california,
rather
than
control
for
this
over
generous
interpretation
of
pregnancy
related
disability
excluded
such
disabilities
from
the
fund
all
together.
the
desire
to
save
money
cannot
justify
and
otherwise
invidious
classification.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson,
this
court
confronted
the
determination
of
congress
in
at
least
40
states
that
public
money
should
not
be
spent
on
welfare
aid
to
new
residents.
the
primary
reason
for
that
one
year
residency
requirement
was
the
legislature’s
desire
to
save
welfare
cost.
this
court
held
that
the
constitution
required
inclusion
of
the
class
deliberately
excluded
by
the
legislature.
significantly
although
this
court
closely
scrutinized
the
classification
in
shapiro
it
indicated
that
the
one
year
residence
requirement
was
vulnerable
even
under
the
traditional,
more
lenient
rational
basis
standard
of
equal
protection
review.
similarly,
both
in
reed
v.
reed,
404
u.s.
and
frontiero
at
411
u.s.,
considerations
of
economy
were
rejected
as
a
basis
for
discriminating
against
women.
indeed
--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
i
believe
you
are
referring
to
footnote
6
in
shapiro
--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
that
footnote
states
that
a
state
disability
program
would
be
entitled
to
tie
benefits
to
contribution
rate
which
california
now
does
by
its
flat
1%
rate.
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
our
position
here.
indeed
to
permit
differential
treatment
on
the
basis
of
sex
solely
because
the
state
wishes
to
save
money
when
perhaps
the
most
pervasive
form
of
discrimination
against
women
is
economic,
is
to
perpetuate
the
historical
discrimination
against
them.
equality
for
women,
as
equality
for
black
persons
has
done
and
will
continue
to
do,
cost
money
as
the
experience
under
title
vii
in
the
equal
pay
act
demonstrate.
nowhere
is
the
economic
discrimination
against
women
more
apparent
than
in
the
rules
and
practices
surrounding
the
reality
that
women
are
the
bearers
of
children.
this
role
which
calls
for
stereotyped
notions
that
women
belong
in
the
home
with
their
children
that
women
are
not
serious
members
of
the
workforce
and
that
women
generally
have
a
male
breadwinner
in
their
families
to
support
them
has
resulted
in
laws
which
force
able
bodied
women
off
the
job
which
denies
them
unemployment
insurance
once
they
have
gone
on
mandatory
maternity
leave,
denies
them
sick
leave
when
their
disability
results
from
pregnancy
and
disability
insurance
as
well
which
does
not
permit
them
to
return
to
work
at
the
time
when
they
become
physically
able,
often
denies
them
seniority
and
other
benefits
which
accrue
to
workers
normally
disabled
and
finally
when
they
try
to
return
to
the
job,
often
the
jobs
themselves
are
denied.
in
light
of
these
realities,
judge
hainsworth’s
conclusion
in
cohen
versus
chesterfield
county
school
board
474
f.
2d
that,
“the
fact
that
only
women
experience
pregnancy
and
motherhood
removes
all
possibility
of
competition
in
this
area
is
simply
false.
rather,
women
who
become
pregnant
suffer
a
serious
competitive
disadvantage
not
because
their
physiological
state
renders
it
inevitable
and
unavoidable
but
because
of
over
broad
and
arbitrary
rules
concerning
that
physiological
state.”
an
example
of
the
kind
of
discriminatory
notions
upon
which
the
state
is
focused
and
made
its
arguments
are
two
examples.
one
of
the
kind
i
just
mentioned
and
another
kind
which
i
will
describe.
the
first
is
that
the
reason
for
the
15-week
duration
is
that
women
will
have
to
go
on
mandatory
maternity
leave
before
they
are
physically
disabled
and
the
doctors
will
provide
for
compensation
during
that
time.
the
second
is
that
doctors,
being
sympathetic
people,
will
take
into
consideration
grounds
other
than
medical
grounds
in
determining
whether
a
woman
continues
to
be
disabled.
this
first
ground,
or
rather
both
grounds
assume
that
doctors
will
not
make
medical
judgments
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
woman
is
physically
disabled
because
of
child
birth.
i
think
there’s
no
basis
for
that
and
in
fact
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
mentioned
in
the
roe
opinion,
doctors
are
a
group
likely
to
carry
out
their
professional
responsibilities.
there
may
well
be
problems
at
first
in
california,
as
there
were
in
rhode
island,
in
educating
people
as
to
what
a
disability
related
to
pregnancy
is
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
the
state
itself
has
shown
confusion
between
childbearing
leave
and
disability
leave
and
it
may
be
that
doctors
will
have
to
be
informed
as
to
what’s
expected
of
them
in
submitting
disability
verifications,
that
doctors
will
collude
with
women
in
order
to
get
them
benefits
which
they
don’t
deserve,
i
think
is
contrary
to
reality
however.
now,
it
has
been
said
that
disability,
that
discrimination
based
upon
pregnancy
should
not
be
considered
to
be
sex
discrimination
for
several
reasons,
the
main
one
being
that
women
are
not
in
competition
with
men
in
this
area
and
in
addition,
that
it
is
a
unique
characteristic
and
those
arguments
are
related.
it’s
only
true
that
pregnancy
is
unique
and
there
is
no
competition
in
situations
in
which
the
law
is
narrowly
and
carefully
drawn
so
that
the
purposes
are
so
stated
that
all
that
could
possibly
be
covered
in
that
situation
as
pregnancy
and
pregnancy
exclusions
would
not
be
irrationally
categorized.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
a
law
which
said
that
a
woman
was
entitled
to
nursing
leave
after
the
birth
of
a
child
would
be
a
rational
statute.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
only
mothers
can
nurse
children.
if
it
was
a
leave
which
said
mothers
can
take
time
off
to
care
for
their
children
after
birth,
that
may
well
discriminate
against
fathers
who
are
perfectly
capable
of
taking
care
of
their
children
in
ways
other
than
nursing.
most
of
the
laws
which
we
have
discussed
here
today
and
which
are
exemplified
by
the
practice
struck
down
in
cohen
and
lafleur
however,
affect
women
in
an
area
where
they
truly
do
compete
with
men
and
put
them
in
a
serious
disadvantage,
not
just
at
the
time
that
they
go
out
of
the
workforce
but
sometimes
in
terms
of
their
whole
working
lives.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
should
be
considered
sex
discrimination.
historically,
we
have
seen
in
cases
like
bradwell,
in
cases
like
muller,
in
cases
like
hoyt,
the
very
justification
for
the
discrimination
against
women
in
those
cases
was
primarily
based
on
their
childbearing
function
and
the
role
which
was
assumed
to
grow
out
of
that
function.
now
as
time
has
gone
on,
these
generalized
discriminations
based
on
pregnancy,
which
for
example
kept
women
out
of
the
legal
profession
for
a
number
of
years
have
gradually
been
struck
down.
but
what
remains
is
the
narrow
area
in
which
these
unique
sex
characteristics
prevent
women
from
full
participation
in
the
labor
force
not
because
of
their
physical
state
but
because
of
rules
which
exclude
them.
now
in
frontiero
versus
laird,
the
plurality
in
that
case
stated
that
the
reason
for
scrutinizing
sex
based
classifications
in
part
was
that
stereotypes
and
generalizations
had
so
grown
up
around
the
status
of
women
that
laws
often
discriminated
against
them,
not
on
any
real
factors,
but
because
of
these
stereotypes.
pregnancy
presents
a
primary
example
of
that.
women
are
thought
of
on
the
one
hand
as
completely
disabled
during
the
whole
pregnancy
and
in
the
next
moment
the
state
can
assert
that
women
are
not
disabled
at
all
and
should
be
excluded
from
a
disability
program.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
they
have
said
that
normal
pregnancy,
the
pregnancy
is
a
normal
physiological
function
and
it
does
not
give
rise
to
illnesses
or
injuries.
i
think
this
is
clearly
contrary
to
fact.
any
common
medical
test
will
indicate
that
when
a
woman
goes
through
the
birth
process,
her
entire
birth
canal
is
to
some
extent
damaged
by
her
giving
birth
that
when
the
child
emerges,
she
often
has
a
surgical
procedure
called
an
episiotomy
which
is
disabling
to
her
for
some
period
of
time.
interestingly
enough
the
state
will
compensate
if
the
child
is
delivered
through
a
surgical
incision
in
the
abdomen
but
will
not
do
so
when
there
is
a
surgical
incision
at
the
end
of
the
birth
canal,
that
women
suffer
disabilities
for
other
physical
reasons
such
as
a
change
in
their
hormone
level
immediately
following
birth
is
also
clear
and
well-established
in
the
medical
text.
the
centrality
of
women’s
biological
reproductive
role
to
historical
and
current
discrimination
against
women
on
the
basis
of
sex
stereotypes
concerning
that
role
leads
to
the
inescapable
conclusion,
so
long
as
classifications
based
upon
pregnancy
are
thrust
outside
the
bounds
of
judicial
scrutiny.
so
long
will
women
suffer
unwarranted
and
arbitrary
discrimination
because
they
are
women.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
yes,
we
do.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
she
has
not
been
paid
disability
benefits.
the
aspirations
of
women
are
inextricably
linked
to
fair
and
realistic
treatment
of
pregnancy
in
the
public
sector.
this
case
presents
one
example
of
a
situation
where
mythology
overcomes
rationality
as
to
the
duration
of
the
disability,
as
to
the
nature
of
the
disability,
and
as
to
the
nature
of
the
woman’s
participation
in
the
workforce.
we
agree
with
appellant
that
pregnancy
is
not
a
disability.
at
the
same
time,
it
does
give
rise
in
certain
situation
to
verifiable
medical
disabilities.
in
a
program
that
compensates
for
work
loss
due
to
every
conceivable
disability,
normal,
voluntary,
unique
to
one
sex,
expensive,
frequent
or
whatever
consideration,
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy
related
disabilities
unconstitutionally
discriminates
against
women.
we
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
we
do
believe
that
this
is
gender
discrimination
but
we
also
believe
that
the
classification
here
is
totally
irrational
under
the
stated
purposes
and
operation
of
the
program.
ms.
condas
gives
as
--
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
well,
in
this
particular
case
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
matter
of
being
ingenious.
i
think
it’s
a
matter
of
seeing
whether
there
is
a
fair
and
substantial
relationship
between
the
differences
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
program
and
it
does
not
exist
here.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
no,
it
would
not.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
no,
it
would
not.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
will
do
that.
these
statistics
which
came
in
on
the
reply
brief
are
statistics
that
we
have
never
seen
before
and
came
into
the
record
very
late
and
we
would
like
the
opportunity
to
respond.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
it
recently
of
course
considered
complications
of
pregnancy
in
the
passage
of
the
bill.
to
my
knowledge,
it
has
not
been
directly
requested
by
anyone
that
i
know
of
but
i
would
have
no
reason
to
know
to
change
its
law.
there
have
been
no
bills
forthcoming
on
this
subject
recently.
ms.
wendy
w.
williams
i
believe
so,
yes.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
terms
of
the
interest
of
the
workers
in
this
case
which
i
believe
goes
to
your
point,
the
california
workers
appear
to
be
in
support
of
this
suit,
at
least
a
large
proportion
of
them.
a
number
of
labor
unions
are
parties
to
this
lawsuit,
both
originally
and
as
interveners
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
to
them
at
least,
the
1%
contribution
rate
that
the
state
argues
is
so
important
to
the
concept
of
the
program
is
not
so
important
to
them
that
it
could
not
be
somewhat
altered
to
cover
this
kind
of
disability.
thank
you.
