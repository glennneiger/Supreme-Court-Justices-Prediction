justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
condas,
are
there
any
exclusions
in
your
plan
for
particular
diseases
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
most
private
plans
do
have
disease
exclusions,
do
they
not
--
i
am
thinking
mainly
of
psychiatric
problems
or
am
i
wrong
on
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
in
california?
[laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
i
suppose
some
of
those
would
run
into
your
short
term
disability
proposition
anyway.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
condas,
before
you
sit
down,
some
of
these
original
plaintiffs
have
been
fully
paid
off
after
the
interim
decision
in
the
state
court,
haven’t
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
so
far
as
they
are
concerned,
the
case
is
moot?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
about
--
it
also
covers
some
peculiarly
feminine
conditions,
hysterectomy,
mastectomy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
of
course
her
choice
is
not
final
in
the
abortion
aspect,
is
this
not
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
referred
to
a
woman
having
an
abortion
when
she
chooses
and
i
merely
asked
whether
under
our
decisions,
her
choice
is
not
a
solitary
factor
that
enters
into
that
decision.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
williams,
what
is
your
comment
to
the
question
i
asked
to
the
opposing
counsel,
do
you
conceive
that
some
of
these
main
plaintiffs
have
a
moot
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
think
that
the
one
mrs.
jaramillo
still
is
one
as
far
as
the
controversy
is
concerned?
