justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
condas,
you
told
us
about
the
rhode
island
experience
and
the
fact
that
rhode
island
was
the
first
state
to
have
any
such
plan
as
this
and
california
the
second.
there
are
now,
about
a
total
of
five
states
or
six?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
just
wondered
if
any
of
the
states
now
have
the
plan
to
provide
maternity
benefits,
currently.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn’t
go
on
a
percentage
out
there,
it
is
fixed
sum
in
dollars?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
two
states
do
pay
for
pregnancy
to
any
of
the
other
three
or
--
what
are
they,
total
of
five?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
leaves
two
others?
justice
potter
stewart
sick
leaves,
illness,
or
injuries?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
the
person
is
in
the
hospital,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
a
flat
percentage,
isn’t
it
rather
than
a
flat
rate?
justice
potter
stewart
1%?
i
was
wondering
if
what
you
just
described
might
be
a
functional,
the
lower
wage
levels
for
women.
they
pay
in
less
therefore
and
even
then
assuming
they
got
the
same
benefits
as
men
did,
they
would
get
greater
proportionate
benefits.
justice
potter
stewart
in
absolute
terms?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
does
it
or
does
it
not
cover
voluntary
abortions?
justice
potter
stewart
or
it
will
depend
upon
the
california
law
which
would
be
limited
by
the
roe
decision
but
within
those
limits
could
the
california
law
could
take
a
variety
of
different
forms
and
impose
a
variety
of
different
limitations.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
an
ingenious
lawyer
under
california’s
present
system
could
bring
a
class
suit
on
behalf
of
all
men,
couldn’t
be
that
they
are
discriminated
against
because
they
get
less
for
what
they
pay
in?
justice
potter
stewart
because
they’re
men.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean.
isn’t
that
factually
true
that
men
as
a
class
under
the
existing
california
plan
quite
--
under
the
existing
plan
pay
in
more
and
get
less
under
this
system?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
williams,
does
your
--
as
i
understood
your
argument,
it
depends
entirely
upon
the
claim
that
this
is
discrimination
based
upon
gender,
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
what
if
we
had
--
what
if
california
should
decide
that
it
would
exclude,
let's
say
all
emotional
or
mental
illnesses
and
compensate
only
physical
illnesses
or
injuries.
presumably
again
at
least
an
ingenious
lawyer
could
make
an
equal
protection
claim,
a
challenge
upon
that
sort
of
exclusion,
but
yours
--
you
don’t
make
that
sort
of
claim,
do
you?
yours
is
entirely
based
upon
the
proposition
that
this
is
gender
discrimination,
sex
discrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
it
would
not
be
an
answer
to
your
argument
to
conclude
that
this
is
not
gender
discrimination?
that
is
what
my
question
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
directed
to.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
only
three.
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
it
isn’t.
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
condas
i
interrupted
you
and
i
wonder
if
you
could
just
summarize
again
these
five
parts
of
the
elephant?
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
one
aspect
of
cost,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
first
of
these
cases,
geduldig
against
aiello
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
for
almost
30
years,
california
has
administered
a
disability
insurance
system
that
pays
benefits
to
people
in
private
employment
who
are
temporarily
unable
to
work
because
of
disability,
not
covered
by
workmen's
compensation.
the
appellees
brought
this
action
in
a
three-judge
district
court
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
provision
of
the
california
program
that
in
defining
the
disability,
excludes
from
coverage,
disability
resulting
from
normal
pregnancy.
the
district
court,
by
a
divided
vote,
held
that
this
provision
of
the
insurance
program
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
therefore,
the
court
enjoined
the
continued
enforcement
of
the
program
with
this
provision
in
it.
we
cannot
agree
that
the
exclusion
of
this
disability
from
coverage
amounts
to
invidious
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
california
does
not
discriminate
with
respect
to
the
persons
or
groups
who
are
eligible
for
disability
insurance
protection.
the
classification
challenged
in
this
case
relates
rather
to
the
asserted
underinclusiveness
of
the
set
of
risks
that
the
state
has
selected
to
insure.
although
california
has
created
a
program
to
insure
most
risks
of
employment
disability,
it
has
not
chosen
to
insure
all
such
risks,
and
this
decision
is
reflected
in
the
level
of
annual
contributions
exacted
from
participating
employees.
it
is
evident
that
our
totally
comprehensive
program
would
be
substantially
more
costly
than
the
present
program
and
would
inevitably
require
state
subsidy,
a
higher
rate
of
employee
contribution,
a
lower
scale
of
benefits
for
those
suffering
insured
disabilities,
or
some
combination
of
these
three
measures.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution,
we
think,
that
requires
the
state
to
subordinate
or
compromise
its
legitimate
interests
solely
to
create
a
more
comprehensive
social
insurance
program
than
it
already
has.
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
maintaining
the
self-supporting
nature
of
its
insurance
program.
similarly,
it
has
an
interest
in
distributing
the
available
resources
in
such
a
way
as
to
keep
benefit
payments
at
an
adequate
level
for
disabilities
that
are
covered,
rather
than
to
cover
all
disabilities
inadequately.
finally,
california
has
a
legitimate
concern
in
maintaining
the
contribution
rate
at
a
level
that
will
not
unduly
burden
participating
employees,
particularly
low-income
employees
who
may
be
most
in
need
of
the
disability
insurance.
these
policies
provide
an
objective
and
wholly
non-invidious
basis
for
the
state's
decision
not
to
create
a
more
comprehensive
insurance
program
than
it
has.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
selection
of
the
risks
insured
by
the
program
worked
to
discriminate
against
any
definable
group
or
class
in
terms
of
the
aggregate
risk
protection
derived
by
that
group
or
class
from
the
program.
there
is
no
risk
from
which
men
are
protected
and
women
are
not.
likewise,
there
is
no
risk
from
which
women
are
protected
and
men
are
not.
the
appellee
simply
contend
that,
although
they
have
received
insurance
protection
equivalent
to
that
provided
all
other
participating
employees,
they
have
suffered
discrimination
because
they've
encountered
a
risk
that
was
outside
the
program's
protection.
for
the
reasons,
i
have
summarized,
which
are
set
out
in
considerably
more
detail
in
the
court's
written
opinion,
we
hold
that
this
contention
is
not
a
valid
one
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
