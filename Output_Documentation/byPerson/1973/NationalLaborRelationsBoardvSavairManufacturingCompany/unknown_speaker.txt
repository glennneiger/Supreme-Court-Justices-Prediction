unknown
speaker
how
many
were
at
the
second
meeting?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
at
least
a
copy
of
the
cards
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
even
among
the
--
it
isn't
either
here?
it
isn't
here
in
any
form?
unknown
speaker
but
was
it
an
application
for
membership?
unknown
speaker
and
did
it
say
that
if
the
union
won,
membership
fees
would
be
waived?
unknown
speaker
was
it
stated
at
the
union
laws
the
application
was
void?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
suppose
the
application
still
stands
for
the
union
laws?
unknown
speaker
practice?
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
the
employee
was
applying
for
membership?
unknown
speaker
and
he
could
only
get
his
--
even
his
dues
would
only
be
waived
if
the
union
won?
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
the
union
sue,
at
least
as
a
theoretical
manner,
for
back
dues
in
court
without
enforcing
it
through
a
union
security
clause?
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
if
the
issue
here
were
a
little
different.
if
the
issue
were
that
of
a
card
majority,
will
the
board's
position
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i
gather
mr.
come,
the
board
then
review
at
least
initially
thought
that
it
fell
on
the
side
of
coercive
side
of
--
unknown
speaker
but
what
was
in
lobue?
unknown
speaker
on
that
thesis,
why
doesn't
the
union
waive
the
initiation
fee
for
everybody
and
not
just
card
signers?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
went
beyond
that
mr.
come.
the
facts
of
this
case
indicates
that
lobue
and
gilmore,
gilmore
enforced
lobue.
unknown
speaker
by
sound
decisions.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know,
i
have
difficulty,
i
read
your
brief
there,
i
can't
read
gilmore,
and
your
decision
there
is
saying
they
were
locked
in
by
gilmore.
but
i
would
say,
frankly
and
candidly,
i
thought
gilmore
and
lobue
were
rightly
decided
and
dit-mco
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
what
year
was
lobue?
unknown
speaker
and
dit-mco?
unknown
speaker
thirteen
years
of
changed
membership?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
twice
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
really
suggest
that
the
hook
there
in
the
offer
that
"if
the
union
wins,
membership
will
be
waived"
they're
just
meanings.
unknown
speaker
although
the
union
must
think
it's
an
effective
device,
that
wouldn't
do
it?
unknown
speaker
the
point
is
that
they
wouldn't
just
do
this
for
nothing.
they
think
it's
effective
enough
to
draw
the
attention
to
this
and
get
favorable
action
of
some
employees?
unknown
speaker
to
get
the
30
%
and
get
the
--
unknown
speaker
in
short,
some
people
would
vote
for
the
union
who
otherwise
might
not
vote
for
the
union?
that's
why
they
do
it.
unknown
speaker
i
would
include
those
who
didn't
--
what
i've
said.
i
mean
--
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
suggest
as
to
stand
of
the
judicial
review
with
that
judgment
of
board?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
standard?
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
before
you
get
to
that,
was
the
board
switched
from
lobue
to
its
present
rule
accompanied
by
any
rulemaking
or
notice
or
was
it
simply
done
by
adjudication?
unknown
speaker
has
the
board
ever
had
a
case
of
the
employees
who
vote
against
the
union
and
who
were
then
charged
of
the
member
initiation
fees
later
who
may
declaim
that
this
couldn't
be
done,
that
this
was
discriminatory
by
the
union?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
are
enough
of
them
and
then
we
ended
up
with
the
majority
of
cards.
we
wouldn't
even
have
an
election?
unknown
speaker
there
is
influence
which
the
chief
justice
speaks
were
sufficient
so
that
the
organizer
ended
up
with
the
card
majority.
we
might
not
even
have
an
election.
unknown
speaker
then
there
is
a
possibility
as
i've
said.
unknown
speaker
gissel
said
--
gissel
indicates
that
the
employer
wants
that
he
can
have
it
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
mr.
come.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
want
to
go
in
any
great
detail
at
this
late
point
of
the
argument
but,
what
substantial
evidence
do
you
find
in
this
record
just
to
contradict
the
testimony
of
the
two
witnesses
who
said
they
weren't
coerced
and
that
this
charge
was
characterized
as
a
final
penalty.
mcknight,
the
fellow
who
was
alleged
to
have
done
the
coercing
was
not
put
on
the
witness
stand.
and
that
the
hearing
officer
at
the
end
of
the
evidence
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
have
stated,
as
i
read
his
testimony
on
page
79
and
80
that
he
has
filed
an
input
to
mcknight
on
and
he
said,
"i'm
not
going
to
take
the
testimony
of
mr.
smith"
which
is
clear
as
i
say,
smith
was
offensive.
unknown
speaker
why
wasn't
that
it
put
on
evidence,
mr.
solner?
at
the
time
when
we
were
here
before
the
hearing
officer.
the
hearing
officer,
as
i
recall
for
the
record
asked
for
someone
had
when
no
one
had
one
with
them.
however,
the
representative
of
the
union,
mr.
smith
said
that
it
was
a
standard
authorization
card.
i've
never
seen
--
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
what
a
standard
authorization
card
is?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
the
union
never
act
on
that
application?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solner,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
come
as
to
the
standard
of
judicial
review
of
the
board's
determination
that
this
falls
outside
the
line
inclusion?
unknown
speaker
what's
your
view
of
the
standard
of
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
that
must
be
an
argument
then
that
coercion
nevertheless
always
exists?
unless
everyone,
all
the
employees
have
the
same?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
law,
then
again.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
any
other
constructs
of
the
act
is
wholly
foreclosed
by
its
language
and
legislative
history?
do
you
think
there's
no
room
for
having
a
different
view
of
what
coercion
is?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
there
is
a
room
for
two
views,
two
constructions
of
the
act
under
its
language
and
legislative
history.
let's
assume
that
there
are
two
views
and
the
other
board
having
held
one
view
for
13
years,
decide
it
wants
to
hold
the
other
view,
the
other
reasonable
view.
what
are
we
suppose
to
do
about
that?
say
that
it's
unreasonable
but
we
have
just
--
by
definition
it
says
it
might
be
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
we
have
to
say
that
that
there's
no
other
view
--
no
other
tenable
view
of
the
act,
construction
of
the
act
before
we
can
disagree
with
the
board
here?
is
that
the
standard
or
not?
unknown
speaker
how
many
were
at
the
second
meeting?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
at
least
a

unknown
speaker

did
it
say
that

the

won,
membership
fees
would
be
waived?
unknown
speaker
was
it
stated
at
the
union
laws
the
application
was
void?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
suppose
the
application
still
stands
for
the
union
laws?
unknown
speaker
practice?
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
the
employee
was
applying
for
membership?

and
he
could
only
get
his
--
even
his
dues
would
only
be
waived
if
the

won?
unknown

well,
can't
the

at

for

in

without
enforcing
it

they
went
beyond
that
mr.
come.
the
facts
of
this
case
indicates
that
lobue
and
gilmore,
gilmore
enforced
lobue.
unknown
speaker
by
sound
decisions.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know,
i
have
difficulty,
i
read
your
brief
there,
i
can't
read
gilmore,
and
your
decision
there
is
saying
they
were
locked
in
by
gilmore.
but
i
would
say,
frankly
and
candidly,
i
thought
gilmore
and
lobue
were
rightly
decided
and
dit-mco
wasn't.
unknown

what

was

thirteen

i
would

those
who
didn't

what
i've
said.
i

what

the

having
held

decide
it

to

the

reasonable

what
are
we

to

about

say
that
it's
unreasonable

we
have
just
--
by

it
says

don't
we
