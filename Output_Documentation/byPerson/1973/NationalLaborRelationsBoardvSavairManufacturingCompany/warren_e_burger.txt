isn't
it
possible?
isn't
it
conceivable
that
some
of
the
22
employees
who
voted
against
the
20
but
decided
to
hedge
by
both
signing
a
card
and
voting
for
the
union,
so
that
if
the
union
won
the
election,
they
would
be
relieved
of
this
fee
obligation.
isn't
that
what
the
case
is
about
whether
this
is
an
improper
inducement?
chief
justice

e.
burger
would
it
be
reasonable
to
say
that
if
an
employee
wanted
to
play
it
both
ways,
he'd
sign
the
card,
so
as
to
hedge
in
that
direction
and
then
vote
against
the
union?

well
then,
if
you
concede
that
then
hasn't
the
offer

in
his
case?

if
you
have
this
unique
and
unusual
fellow,
it
would
be

to

this

very

well,
if
a
reviewing
court
and
the
judges
of
the
reviewing
court
reach
the
conclusion
that
it
was
contrary
to
ordinary
human
experience
to
say
that
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
union
did
not
influence
the
result
then
it
would
be,
it
would
follow;
it
was
an
arbitrary
action
and
could
be
reversed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fact
that
they
once
have
one
view
and
now
took
another
doesn't
make
both
views
permissible,
does
it?
