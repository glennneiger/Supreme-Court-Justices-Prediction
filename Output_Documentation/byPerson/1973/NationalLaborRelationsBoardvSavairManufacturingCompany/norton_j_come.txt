mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
basic
question
is,
whether
it
is
permissible
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
exercise
of
its
broad
discretion
to
establish
the
standards
and
safeguards
for
conducting
a
fair
and
free
representation
election
to
conclude
that
a
union's
offer
to
waive
initiation
fees
for
all
employees
who
signed
union
authorization
cards
before
the
election,
should
the
union
win
the
election,
does
not
tend
to
interfere
with
the
employee
free
choice
in
the
election.
the
facts
are
these.
in
september
of
1970,
pursuant
to
a
representation
petition
filed
by
the
mechanics
educational
society
of
america,
the
board
conducted
a
secret
ballot
election
among
the
production
and
maintenance
employees
of
the
savair
manufacturing
company.
the
union
won
the
election
by
a
vote
of
22
to
20.
the
company
filed
objections
to
the
election
alleging
among
other
things
that
union
representatives
had
improperly
coerced
certain
employees
by
leading
them
to
believe
that
if
they
failed
or
refused
to
sign
a
card
requesting
an
election
and
the
union
were
successful,
they
would
be
fined
from
to
$20.00
to
$200.00
before
they
could
join
the
union.
these
objections
were
investigated
and
set
down
for
hearing
before
a
hearing
officer
of
the
board
who
found
that
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
representation
petition,
bennie
mcknight,
an
employee
supporter
of
the
union,
solicited
employees
to
sign
cards
applying
for
membership
in
the
union,
which
cards
were
to
be
used
to
support
the
petition
as
this
court
note
out
those
that
generally,
the
board
requires
a
support
of
30%
in
cards
before
it
will
process
a
representation
petition.
mcknight
told
the
employees
that
if
they
did
not
sign
a
card
now,
they
would
be
subject
to
an
assessment
or
a
fine
if
the
union
won
the
election.
when
the
employees
questioned
mcknight
about
the
union's
policy,
he
told
them
to
call
alfred
smith,
the
union
secretary-treasurer
whose
phone
number
he
gave
them.
after
the
election
petition
was
filed
but
before
the
election
was
held,
smith
addressed
the
group
of
about
20
employees.
in
response
to
a
question
about
the
assessment,
he
explained
that
it
was
the
union's
policy
to
waive
initiation
fees
in
organizing
new
shops
but
to
require
a
small
fee
to
be
paid
by
the
persons
joining
the
union
after
a
contract
had
been
negotiated.
in
fact,
the
union's
constitution
and
by-laws
provide
for
the
local
union
to
set
the
initiation
fees,
which
in
no
event
can
exceed
$10.00.
smith
added
that
there
was
no
assessment
or
fine
in
our
organization
in
regards
to
the
situation
of
membership.
the
only
time
the
fine
was
imposed
was
for
violation
of
the
union's
constitution
or
by-laws.
the
hearing
officer
concluded
that
what
the
union
did
through
smith
and
mcknight
was
to
inform
employees
that
an
initiation
fee
would
be
waived
in
the
eventuality
of
a
successful
election
by
the
union.
he
further
found
that
whatever
confusion
may
have
re-existed
with
respect
to
the
terminology
utilized
by
mcknight,
the
union's
policy
was
clarified
at
this
initial
organizational
meeting
at
which
smith
explained
the
union's
policy
when
he
held
a
subsequent
meeting
shortly
before
the
election
going
over
the
same
ground.
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
the
first
meeting,
there
were
about
20
employees
and
he
indicated
that
about
the
same
number
were
at
the
second
meeting.
the
first
meeting
was
attended
by
the
card
signers.
he
explained
that
those
were
the
only
names
and
addresses
that
he
had
and
that's
what
the
notice
went
out
to.
there
is
no
indication
as
to
who
in
addition
may
have
been
present
at
the
second
meeting.
following
the
board's
decision
in
dit-mco
that
a
waiver
of
initiation
fees
prior
to
an
election,
is
not
an
improper
inducement
for
vote
for
the
union
regardless
of
whether
it
was
contingent
upon
the
results
of
the
election.
the
hearing
officer
concluded
that
the
union's
waiver
offer
did
not
impair
free
choice
in
the
election
and
recommended
that
the
union
be
certified.
i
should
point
out
that
dit-mco
represents
a
reversal
of
the
board's
earlier
position
in
lobue
in
which
the
board
had
concluded
that
if
the
waiver
was
tied
to
the
outcome
of
the
election,
it
was
improper.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
not
a
copy
of
the
cards
in
the
record.
what
we
do
have
in
the
record
is
a
testimony
by
the
union
agent.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
it
was.
it
was
an
application
for
membership
and
that
it
authorize
the
union
to
represent
the
employee
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
the
card
did
not
say
that.
it
was
a
typical
authorization
card
which,
as
i
say,
was
an
application
for
membership
and
it
authorizes
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
did
not
say
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
that
the
union
agent,
mr.
smith,
testified
that
it
was
the
practice
of
the
union
not
to
collect
any
initiation
fee.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
unless
they
won
the
election
and
they
got
a
contract
which
is
not
a
typical
as
i
understand
the
practice
of
the
union
organization.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
was
applying
for
membership.
mr.
norton
j.
come
his
initiation
fee
would
be
waived
if
the
union
won.
however,
the
union
is
not
in
a
position
under
the
act
as
i
hope
to,
as
i
was
planning
to
get
to.
to
compel
an
employee
to
pay
initiation
fees
until
(a)
it
wins
the
election,
(b)
it
manages
to
negotiate
a
contract
with
an
employer
and;
(c)
gets
a
contract
which
has
a
union
security
clause
and
that
which
requires
the
payment
of
dues
and
fees
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
know
of
no
such
situations
where
they
have
done
so
merely
on
the
basis
of
an
authorization
card
of
the
client
that
we
had
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board's
position
as
i
understand
it
would
not
be
any
different.
i
do
think,
however,
that
the
fact
that
you
do
have
an
election
here
makes
this
an
easier
case
because
in
terms
of
the
employee
who
does
not
want
the
union
and
merely
signs
the
card
as
a
hedge.
he
has
a
double
insurance
by
voting
"no"
in
the
election.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
is
the
question.
i
think
that
there's
no
question
that
it
is
an
inducement
to
sign
a
union
card.
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
type
of
inducement,
which
is
likely
to
influence
the
employees'
vote
in
the
election.
for
example,
there's
no
question
that
if
the
union
promises
to
get
the
employees
a
wage
increase
if
it
wins
the
election,
that
may
well
be
an
inducement
for
the
employees
to
vote
for
the
union
in
the
election.
but
that
type
of
inducement
the
board
and
the
courts
have
held
is
not
the
kind
that
would
preclude
a
rational
choice.
now,
in
this
area
of
what
inducement
is
going
to
fall
on
which
side
of
the
line,
i
submit
that
that
can
often
be
a
fine
question.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
felt
that
it
fell
in
the
coercive
side
not
with
respect
to
the
waiver
of
the
initiation
fee.
the
board
almost
from
the
beginning
has
taken
the
position
that
an
offer
to
waive
initiation
fees
during
an
organizational
campaign
was
a
legitimate
type
of
inducement
and
did
not
interfere
with
the
employee
free
choice.
it
serves
the
legitimate
purpose
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
lobue,
the
thing
that
the
board
felt
it
made
it
improper
was
that,
in
addition
to
offering
to
waiving
the
card
of
the
union
furnished
was
a
membership
card,
and
at
the
bottom
of
it,
it
said,
"the
employee
shall
be
entitled
to
put
a
paid-up
initiation
fee
upon
if
the
union
wins
the
election"
with
the
addition
of
"if
the
union
wins
the
election"
that
the
board
felt
tipped
the
scales.
now,
on
reconsideration
in
dit-mco
which
was
applied
here,
it
was
the
board's
judgment
that
whether
you
exquisitely
stated
that
the
waiver
would
be
effective
if
the
union
wins
the
election
or
you
didn't
as
so
state,
didn't
make
any
realistic
difference
because
that
fact
would
be
understood
in
any
event.
because
the
way
that
the
thing
operates,
as
i
explained
before
is
that
the
only
time
that
the
union
is
in
a
position
to
force
an
employee
to
pay
an
initiation
fee
is
if
it
wins
the
election,
it
gets
a
contract
and
the
contract
has
a
union
security
clause
in
it.
so,
in
effect,
what
the
board
concluded
in
dit-mco
was
that
it
was
really
relying
upon
an
artificial
factor
in
making
the
propriety
of
the
waiver
turn
upon
whether
or
not
the
union
said
nothing
or
whether
they
were
candid
enough
to
add
that
the
waiver
is
effective
only
if
we
win
the
election.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
reason
that
the
union
--
well,
some
do,
i
might
say.
but
generally,
the
reason
why
they
do
not
is
that
they
want
to
speed
up
the
election
campaign
and
get
a
quick
election
because
the
longer
the
campaign
may
be
dragged
out,
not
only
the
more
expensive
may
it
be
but
the
more
likelihood
for
other
factors
entering
into
the
picture.
but
the
waiver
serves
the
legitimate
function
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
was
solely
a
current
case,
i
might
point
out,
there
was
no
election
there.
that
the
waiver
serves
the
legitimate
purpose
of
removing
what
might
have
been
an
artificial
barrier
of
the
union
membership
namely,
making
employees
pay
before
the
union
has
not
only
done
anything
for
them
but
before
the
it's
even
certain
that
they're
going
to
be
there
when
they
are
going
to
be
their
bargaining
representative.
now,
i
might
say
that
the
dit-mco
decision
of
the
board
was
approved
by
the
eight
circuit,
and
it
was
also
approved
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
turner
case
in
which
it
was
also
applied.
the
sixth
circuit
here
disapproved
of
the
dit-mco
decision
largely
as
we
read
their
decision
because
they
felt
that
they
had
been
locked
in
by
their
earlier
decision
in
gilmore.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
agree
that
they
did
go
beyond
that
and
i'm
not
resting
solely
upon
that
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
they
unquestionably
came
out
with
that
holding.
however,
in
distinguishing
dit-mco
in
that
is
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit's
opinions,
they
pointed
out
that
neither
of
those
cases
was
the
court
called
upon
but
overrule
a
controlling
precedent
of
its
own.
and
then
earlier,
they
had
sort
of
a
thought
that
we
were
urging
that
merely
because
the
board
had
overruled
lobue,
that
ultimately
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
lobue,
i
believe
was
in
1954.
mr.
norton
j.
come
dit-mco
was
in
1967.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
they
believe
that
to
waive
an
initiation
fee
is
effective
for
the
reason
it's
a
legitimate
reason
that
i
indicated.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
get
the
30%
and
there
were
no
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there's
some
of
that
but
there's
also
a
factor,
a
large
factor
of
those
that
may
be
favorable
to
the
union
but
are
hesitant
about
signing
because
they
don't
want
to
incur
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
however,
granted
that
you
have
these
complex
factors.
i
submit
that
the
board
would
cease
an
awful
lot
of
these
election
cases
is
not
unreasonable
and
in
concluding.
mr.
norton
j.
come
whether
the
board
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
it
is
within
the
area
of
the
board's
discretion
to
establish
the
safeguards
and
standards
for
conducting
a
fair
representation
election.
getting
back
to
the
point
that
i
was
making,
that
the
likelihood
that
at
least,
this
is
at
the
board's
judgment,
which
i
submit
is
a
reasonable
one.
that
someone
who
was
opposed
to
the
union
would
sign
a
card
because
of
the
inducement
that
initiation
fees
would
be
waived
and
then
vote
"yes"
for
the
union
merely
to
protect
that
contingent
benefit
is
remote
enough
for
the
board
to
have
discounted
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
voter
who
must
be
assumed
to
have
some
element
of
reason
and
be
aware
of
the
real
world.
it
cannot
help
but
recognize
that
a
"yes"
vote
would
not
only,
it
might
save
him
the
disability
of
having
to
pay
initiation
fee
or
it
would
ensure
that
he
would
get
a
bargaining
representative
that
he
doesn't
want.
and
secondly,
that
the
initiation
fees
are
only
the
beginning
because
much
more
significant
is
a
requirement
of
having
to
pay
periodic
dues
whenever
other
assessments
the
union
might
impose.
so,
for
those
reasons,
i
submit
that
the
board
could
reasonably
conclude
that
there
was
no
improper
inducement
here.
now
my
brother
is
going
to
seek
to
defend
the
court's
decision
on
the
further
ground
here
that
the
regional
director
did
not
conduct
an
adequate
investigation
of
the
election
objections.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
done
by
adjudication,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
know
that
you
could
say
that
it
has
influence
on
it.
it
might
be
carved.
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that
your
honor?
if
you
have
enough
of
them,
you
wouldn't
have
an
election?
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
you're
referring
to
the
gissel
decision
where
the
board
would
give
a
bargaining
or
they're
based
upon
cards
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
does
not
ordinarily
give
a
bargaining
order
based
upon
cards
have
on
an
employer
around
for
a
labor
practices.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
testimony
of
individuals
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
coerced
or
not
even
after
the
event
both
the
board
and
the
courts
recognized
this
highly
subjective
and
a
very
little
provident
value.
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
circumstances
are
such
that
you
can
objectively
include
whether
it's
reasonable
to
believe
that
there
was
coercion
or
not.
and
the
more
i
submit
that
the
circumstances
here
warrant
that
influence.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statement
of
the
testimony
of
bridgeman
and
rice,
who
are
the
two
that
the
company
relies
on
here.
the
hearing
officer
follow
on
that
bridgeman's
testimony
was
no
probative
value
at
all
because
of
his
propensity
to
confuse
fine
assessment
and
initiation
fee.
and
therefore
based
upon
his
testimony
as
a
whole,
he
found
no
basis
for
believing
that
there
had
been
a
threat
or
a
fine
either
before
or
after
the
election
petition.
with
respect
to
rice,
the
hearing
officer
found
and
credited
his
statement
and
mcknight
had
mentioned
the
word
"fine"
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
but
then
he
went
on
and
define
that
smith's
explanations
at
the
organizational
meetings
which
were
held
shortly
thereafter
completely
clarified
the
union's
position.
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
with
regard
to
the
failure
to
conduct
an
adequate
investigation,
the
court
of
appeals
examined
that
contention
and
found
no
merit
to
it.
since
my
time
is
up,
i
have
to
refer
the
court
to
our
further
position
on
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
basic
question
is,
whether
it
is
permissible
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
exercise
of
its
broad
discretion
to
establish
the
standards
and
safeguards
for
conducting
a
fair
and
free
representation
election
to
conclude
that
a
union's
offer
to
waive
initiation
fees
for
all
employees
who
signed
union
authorization
cards
before
the
election,
should
the
union
win
the
election,
does
not
tend
to
interfere
with
the
employee
free
choice
in
the
election.
the
facts
are
these.
in
september
of
1970,
pursuant
to
a
representation
petition
filed
by
the
mechanics
educational
society
of
america,
the
board
conducted
a
secret
ballot
election
among
the
production
and
maintenance
employees
of
the
savair
manufacturing
company.
the
union
won
the
election
by
a
vote
of
22
to
20.
the
company
filed
objections
to
the
election
alleging
among
other
things
that
union
representatives
had
improperly
coerced
certain
employees
by
leading
them
to
believe
that
if
they
failed
or
refused
to
sign
a
card
requesting
an
election
and
the
union
were
successful,
they
would
be
fined
from
to
$20.00
to
$200.00
before
they
could
join
the
union.
these
objections
were
investigated
and
set
down
for
hearing
before
a
hearing
officer
of
the
board
who
found
that
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
representation
petition,
bennie
mcknight,
an
employee
supporter
of
the
union,
solicited
employees
to
sign
cards
applying
for
membership
in
the
union,
which
cards
were
to
be
used
to
support
the
petition
as
this
court
note
out
those
that
generally,
the
board
requires
a
support
of
30%
in
cards
before
it
will
process
a
representation
petition.
mcknight
told
the
employees
that
if
they
did
not
sign
a
card
now,
they
would
be
subject
to
an
assessment
or
a
fine
if
the
union
won
the
election.
when
the
employees
questioned
mcknight
about
the
union's
policy,
he
told
them
to
call
alfred
smith,
the
union
secretary-treasurer
whose
phone
number
he
gave
them.
after
the
election
petition
was
filed
but
before
the
election
was
held,
smith
addressed
the
group
of
about
20
employees.
in
response
to
a
question
about
the
assessment,
he
explained
that
it
was
the
union's
policy
to
waive
initiation
fees
in
organizing
new
shops
but
to
require
a
small
fee
to
be
paid
by
the
persons
joining
the
union
after
a
contract
had
been
negotiated.
in
fact,
the
union's
constitution
and
by-laws
provide
for
the
local
union
to
set
the
initiation
fees,
which
in
no
event
can
exceed
$10.00.
smith
added
that
there
was
no
assessment
or
fine
in
our
organization
in
regards
to
the
situation
of
membership.
the
only
time
the
fine
was
imposed
was
for
violation
of
the
union's
constitution
or
by-laws.
the
hearing
officer
concluded
that
what
the
union
did
through
smith
and
mcknight
was
to
inform
employees
that
an
initiation
fee
would
be
waived
in
the
eventuality
of
a
successful
election
by
the
union.
he
further
found
that
whatever
confusion
may
have
re-existed
with
respect
to
the
terminology
utilized
by
mcknight,
the
union's
policy
was
clarified
at
this
initial
organizational
meeting
at
which
smith
explained
the
union's
policy
when
he
held
a
subsequent
meeting
shortly
before
the
election
going
over
the
same
ground.
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
the
first
meeting,
there
were
about
20
employees
and
he
indicated
that
about
the
same
number
were
at
the
second
meeting.
the
first
meeting
was
attended
by
the
card
signers.
he
explained
that
those
were
the
only
names
and
addresses
that
he
had
and
that's
what
the
notice
went
out
to.
there
is
no
indication
as
to
who
in
addition
may
have
been
present
at
the
second
meeting.
following
the
board's
decision
in
dit-mco
that
a
waiver
of
initiation
fees
prior
to
an
election,
is
not
an
improper
inducement
for
vote
for
the
union
regardless
of
whether
it
was
contingent
upon
the
results
of
the
election.
the
hearing
officer
concluded
that
the
union's
waiver
offer
did
not
impair
free
choice
in
the
election
and
recommended
that
the
union
be
certified.
i
should
point
out
that
dit-mco
represents
a
reversal
of
the
board's
earlier
position
in
lobue
in
which
the
board
had
concluded
that
if
the
waiver
was
tied
to
the
outcome
of
the
election,
it
was
improper.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
not
a
copy
of
the
cards
in
the
record.
what
we
do
have
in
the
record
is
a
testimony
by
the
union
agent.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
it
was.
it
was
an
application
for
membership
and
that
it
authorize
the
union
to
represent
the
employee
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
the
card
did
not
say
that.
it
was
a
typical
authorization
card
which,
as
i
say,
was
an
application
for
membership
and
it
authorizes
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
did
not
say
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
that
the
union
agent,
mr.
smith,
testified
that
it
was
the
practice
of
the
union
not
to
collect
any
initiation
fee.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
unless
they
won
the
election
and
they
got
a
contract
which
is
not
a
typical
as
i
understand
the
practice
of
the
union
organization.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
was
applying
for
membership.
mr.
norton
j.
come
his
initiation
fee
would
be
waived
if
the
union
won.
however,
the
union
is
not
in
a
position
under
the
act
as
i
hope
to,
as
i
was
planning
to
get
to.
to
compel
an
employee
to
pay
initiation
fees
until
(a)
it
wins
the
election,
(b)
it
manages
to
negotiate
a
contract
with
an
employer
and;
(c)
gets
a
contract
which
has
a
union
security
clause
and
that
which
requires
the
payment
of
dues
and
fees
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
know
of
no
such
situations
where
they
have
done
so
merely
on
the
basis
of
an
authorization
card
of
the
client
that
we
had
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board's
position
as
i
understand
it
would
not
be
any
different.
i
do
think,
however,
that
the
fact
that
you
do
have
an
election
here
makes
this
an
easier
case
because
in
terms
of
the
employee
who
does
not
want
the
union
and
merely
signs
the
card
as
a
hedge.
he
has
a
double
insurance
by
voting
"no"
in
the
election.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
is
the
question.
i
think
that
there's
no
question
that
it
is
an
inducement
to
sign
a
union
card.
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
type
of
inducement,
which
is
likely
to
influence
the
employees'
vote
in
the
election.
for
example,
there's
no
question
that
if
the
union
promises
to
get
the
employees
a
wage
increase
if
it
wins
the
election,
that
may
well
be
an
inducement
for
the
employees
to
vote
for
the
union
in
the
election.
but
that
type
of
inducement
the
board
and
the
courts
have
held
is
not
the
kind
that
would
preclude
a
rational
choice.
now,
in
this
area
of
what
inducement
is
going
to
fall
on
which
side
of
the
line,
i
submit
that
that
can
often
be
a
fine
question.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
felt
that
it
fell
in
the
coercive
side
not
with
respect
to
the
waiver
of
the
initiation
fee.
the
board
almost
from
the
beginning
has
taken
the
position
that
an
offer
to
waive
initiation
fees
during
an
organizational
campaign
was
a
legitimate
type
of
inducement
and
did
not
interfere
with
the
employee
free
choice.
it
serves
the
legitimate
purpose
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
lobue,
the
thing
that
the
board
felt
it
made
it
improper
was
that,
in
addition
to
offering
to
waiving
the
card
of
the
union
furnished
was
a
membership
card,
and
at
the
bottom
of
it,
it
said,
"the
employee
shall
be
entitled
to
put
a
paid-up
initiation
fee
upon
if
the
union
wins
the
election"
with
the
addition
of
"if
the
union
wins
the
election"
that
the
board
felt
tipped
the
scales.
now,
on
reconsideration
in
dit-mco
which
was
applied
here,
it
was
the
board's
judgment
that
whether
you
exquisitely
stated
that
the
waiver
would
be
effective
if
the
union
wins
the
election
or
you
didn't
as
so
state,
didn't
make
any
realistic
difference
because
that
fact
would
be
understood
in
any
event.
because
the
way
that
the
thing
operates,
as
i
explained
before
is
that
the
only
time
that
the
union
is
in
a
position
to
force
an
employee
to
pay
an
initiation
fee
is
if
it
wins
the
election,
it
gets
a
contract
and
the
contract
has
a
union
security
clause
in
it.
so,
in
effect,
what
the
board
concluded
in
dit-mco
was
that
it
was
really
relying
upon
an
artificial
factor
in
making
the
propriety
of
the
waiver
turn
upon
whether
or
not
the
union
said
nothing
or
whether
they
were
candid
enough
to
add
that
the
waiver
is
effective
only
if
we
win
the
election.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
reason
that
the
union
--
well,
some
do,
i
might
say.
but
generally,
the
reason
why
they
do
not
is
that
they
want
to
speed
up
the
election
campaign
and
get
a
quick
election
because
the
longer
the
campaign
may
be
dragged
out,
not
only
the
more
expensive
may
it
be
but
the
more
likelihood
for
other
factors
entering
into
the
picture.
but
the
waiver
serves
the
legitimate
function
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
was
solely
a
current
case,
i
might
point
out,
there
was
no
election
there.
that
the
waiver
serves
the
legitimate
purpose
of
removing
what
might
have
been
an
artificial
barrier
of
the
union
membership
namely,
making
employees
pay
before
the
union
has
not
only
done
anything
for
them
but
before
the
it's
even
certain
that
they're
going
to
be
there
when
they
are
going
to
be
their
bargaining
representative.
now,
i
might
say
that
the
dit-mco
decision
of
the
board
was
approved
by
the
eight
circuit,
and
it
was
also
approved
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
turner
case
in
which
it
was
also
applied.
the
sixth
circuit
here
disapproved
of
the
dit-mco
decision
largely
as
we
read
their
decision
because
they
felt
that
they
had
been
locked
in
by
their
earlier
decision
in
gilmore.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
agree
that
they
did
go
beyond
that
and
i'm
not
resting
solely
upon
that
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
they
unquestionably
came
out
with
that
holding.
however,
in
distinguishing
dit-mco
in
that
is
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit's
opinions,
they
pointed
out
that
neither
of
those
cases
was
the
court
called
upon
but
overrule
a
controlling
precedent
of
its
own.
and
then
earlier,
they
had
sort
of
a
thought
that
we
were
urging
that
merely
because
the
board
had
overruled
lobue,
that
ultimately
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
lobue,
i
believe
was
in
1954.
mr.
norton
j.
come
dit-mco
was
in
1967.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
they
believe
that
to
waive
an
initiation
fee
is
effective
for
the
reason
it's
a
legitimate
reason
that
i
indicated.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
get
the
30%
and
there
were
no
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there's
some
of
that
but
there's
also
a
factor,
a
large
factor
of
those
that
may
be
favorable
to
the
union
but
are
hesitant
about
signing
because
they
don't
want
to
incur
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
however,
granted
that
you
have
these
complex
factors.
i
submit
that
the
board
would
cease
an
awful
lot
of
these
election
cases
is
not
unreasonable
and
in
concluding.
mr.
norton
j.
come
whether
the
board
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
it
is
within
the
area
of
the
board's
discretion
to
establish
the
safeguards
and
standards
for
conducting
a
fair
representation
election.
getting
back
to
the
point
that
i
was
making,
that
the
likelihood
that
at
least,
this
is
at
the
board's
judgment,
which
i
submit
is
a
reasonable
one.
that
someone
who
was
opposed
to
the
union
would
sign
a
card
because
of
the
inducement
that
initiation
fees
would
be
waived
and
then
vote
"yes"
for
the
union
merely
to
protect
that
contingent
benefit
is
remote
enough
for
the
board
to
have
discounted
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
voter
who
must
be
assumed
to
have
some
element
of
reason
and
be
aware
of
the
real
world.
it
cannot
help
but
recognize
that
a
"yes"
vote
would
not
only,
it
might
save
him
the
disability
of
having
to
pay
initiation
fee
or
it
would
ensure
that
he
would
get
a
bargaining
representative
that
he
doesn't
want.
and
secondly,
that
the
initiation
fees
are
only
the
beginning
because
much
more
significant
is
a
requirement
of
having
to
pay
periodic
dues
whenever
other
assessments
the
union
might
impose.
so,
for
those
reasons,
i
submit
that
the
board
could
reasonably
conclude
that
there
was
no
improper
inducement
here.
now
my
brother
is
going
to
seek
to
defend
the
court's
decision
on
the
further
ground
here
that
the
regional
director
did
not
conduct
an
adequate
investigation
of
the
election
objections.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
done
by
adjudication,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
know
that
you
could
say
that
it
has
influence
on
it.
it
might
be
carved.
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that
your
honor?
if
you
have
enough
of
them,
you
wouldn't
have
an
election?
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
you're
referring
to
the
gissel
decision
where
the
board
would
give
a
bargaining
or
they're
based
upon
cards
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
does
not
ordinarily
give
a
bargaining
order
based
upon
cards
have
on
an
employer
around
for
a
labor
practices.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
testimony
of
individuals
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
coerced
or
not
even
after
the
event
both
the
board
and
the
courts
recognized
this
highly
subjective
and
a
very
little
provident
value.
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
circumstances
are
such
that
you
can
objectively
include
whether
it's
reasonable
to
believe
that
there
was
coercion
or
not.
and
the
more
i
submit
that
the
circumstances
here
warrant
that
influence.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statement
of
the
testimony
of
bridgeman
and
rice,
who
are
the
two
that
the
company
relies
on
here.
the
hearing
officer
follow
on
that
bridgeman's
testimony
was
no
probative
value
at
all
because
of
his
propensity
to
confuse
fine
assessment
and
initiation
fee.
and
therefore
based
upon
his
testimony
as
a
whole,
he
found
no
basis
for
believing
that
there
had
been
a
threat
or
a
fine
either
before
or
after
the
election
petition.
with
respect
to
rice,
the
hearing
officer
found
and
credited
his
statement
and
mcknight
had
mentioned
the
word
"fine"
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
but
then
he
went
on
and
define
that
smith's
explanations
at
the
organizational
meetings
which
were
held
shortly
thereafter
completely
clarified
the
union's
position.
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
with
regard
to
the
failure
to
conduct
an
adequate
investigation,
the
court
of
appeals
examined
that
contention
and
found
no
merit
to
it.
since
my
time
is
up,
i
have
to
refer
the
court
to
our
further
position
on
that.
