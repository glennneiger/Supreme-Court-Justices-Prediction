mr.
robert
j.
solner
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
my
name
is
robert
solner.
i'm
the
attorney
representing
savair
manufacturing
company.
they're
a
small
manufacturing
concern
located
in
warren,
michigan.
there
are
two
issues
in
this
particular
case
and
of
course
the
first
issue
which
the
counsel
has
gone
through
in
detail
in
the
facts
and
i
don't
want
to
be
redundant
going
over
those
facts.
now,
the
main
issue
of
this
case
and
that's
why
we're
here
is
because
of
this
conflict
among
the
circuits.
this
issue,
as
i
see
this
issue,
involves
several
cases
that
involve
a
little
different
set
of
facts
in
each
one.
we
talked
about
an
authorization
card
in
one.
in
gilmore,
they
said
the
card
was
immaterial.
others
they
talked
about
what
was
said
by
the
union
representative
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
the
effect.
in
our
particular
case,
here
onto
this
set
of
facts,
there
was
an
authorization
card.
it's
very
clear
for
the
record
at
the
time
that
the
hearing
officer
had
testimonies
on
one
page
there
that
this
was
an
authorization
card
and
it
actually
was
an
application
to
join
the
union.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
i
haven't
seen
one,
so
i
didn't
know
myself
but
they
explained
what
it
said.
and
it
said
something
to
the
effect
that
"i
authorize
the
mesa
to
act
as
my
representative
to
bargain
with"
and
there
was
a
blank
space
and
they
fill
in
the
company
name
and
"that
i
hereto
abide
by
and
make
application
to
join
the
union."
and
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
smith,
he
made
it
very
clear
because
i
cross-examined
him
on
this
to
whether
this
man
could
join
the
union
before
the
election.
because
they
were
getting
these
cards
signed
up
and
we're
not
talking
about
pre-petition
for
the
petition
was
filed
for
the
election.
these
were
cards
that
were
signed
after
the
petition
and
an
election
have
been
scheduled.
they
were
getting
cards
signed?
i
asked
him
if
he
had
a
card
signed
if
he
could
join,
this
man
could
join
the
union.
he
made
it
very
clear
that
there
was
merely
an
application
until
such
time
as
they
have
a
contract.
they
could
not
belong
to
the
union.
and
once
there
they
could
not
belong
with
the
union.
he
said,
the
only
ones
that
he
allowed
to
belong
with
the
union
were
they
withdraw
a
card
from
a
shop
where
they
have
had
a
contract
or
at
the
representatives
of
the
union
who
were
members,
who
were
dues
paying
but
they
were
actually
business
agents
in
that
sort.
but
the
card
itself
was
merely
an
application
to
join
the
union
and
it
was
this
authorization
card.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
well,
i
assume
as
soon
as
they
would
negotiate
a
contract,
then
at
that
point,
they
would
then
say
that
all
these
people
who
signed
cards
don't
pay
any
initiation
fee.
they
become
members
and
of
course,
they
close
shop
and
they'll
say
that
you
have
the
check
up
system
in
the
shop
for
the
other
employees
to
withhold
of
their
initiation
fee
and
their
dues.
and
those
who
have
signed
the
card
will
get
a
waiver.
of
course,
i
am
not
in
disagreement
in
the
respondent
with
the
right
of
the
board
of
course
to
have
a
blanket
waiver
of
initiation
fees.
they
don't
themselves
in
a
fear
with
the
choice.
the
union
was
to
waive
for
all,
it's
equal
to
all,
and
all
participates
the
same
way.
i
agree
with
the
board's
position
in
that
regard.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
this
was
where
they
obtained
the
card
on
economic
inducement
and
based
it
on
the
outcome
of
the
election.
for
those
people
that
signed
the
card
and
i'd
say
that's
a
moral
commitment
that
that
person
is
asked
to
make
based
on
an
economic
inducement.
in
other
words,
he
has
him
sign
the
application,
the
union
representative
and
say
now,
"okay,
you
made
a
commitment
to
have
these
union
representatives."
the
side
of
this
card
is
definitely,
i
think,
material
to
the
union's
position
of
wanting
this
commitment
because
it
leaves
the
employee
absolutely
no
alternative.
he
cannot
afford
not
to
sign
the
card
because
if
he
doesn't
sign
the
card
and
the
union
is
elected
then
he
is
penalized.
secondly,
if
he
doesn't
show
an
interest
for
the
union
when
he
is
asked
to
sign
a
card,
then
he
may
feel
or
after
the
union
later
when
they
get
in
and
say,
"this
man
didn't
have
the
interest."
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
pressure
put
on
these
fellows
between
the
time
that
the
election
was
scheduled
and
that
final
date
when
that
election
was
held
to
sign
those
cards
because
several
of
them
signed
it
right
at
the
last
day
just
as
a
hedge.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
no,
i
do
not
agree.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
well,
i
think
that
they'll
have
conditions
have
to
be
equal
for
both
parties.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
be
equal
for
the
employer
or
the
union.
but
they
have
to
be
clear
of
a
free
choice.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
that's
correct.
that's
what
i'm
--
mr.
robert
j.
solner
that's
my
position
would
be.
that
it
have
to
be
a
matter
of
law.
that
it
should
be
free,
they
should
have
--
that
all
parties
should
be
equal
in
that
treatment.
and
that
there's
no
difference
if
the
--
i
cannot
picture
an
employer
being
able
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
saying,
we
want
to
show
you
our
strength
so
we'll
ask
a
man
to
come
off
the
line,
come
in
and
sign
a
petition
to
say
that
we
don't
want
the
union.
(voice
overlap)
that
employee
would
never
exercise
it.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
oh,
no!
certainly,
they
have,
the
board
has
the
right.
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
the
law.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
well,
if
the
board
is
charged
with
the
duty
to
conduct
an
election
under
conditions
which
give
employees
the
freedom
of
choice
and
if
the
board
is
setting
those
standards
does
that,
then
i
assume
that
the
court
can
interfere.
what
i'm
saying
under
these
facts
however,
is
that
they
didn't
give
them
that.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
i
think
so.
yes.
you
have
to
interpret
the
act
to
say
that
this
act
gives
a
certain
obligation
on
that
board.
and
if
that
board
doesn't
follow
the
act
and
isn't
following
the
act,
then
it's
a
matter
of
law
that
they're
not
following
the
act.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
cases
in
which
they
reversed
themselves,
i'm
inclined
to
think
it
could.
it
could
because
they
do
say
in
effect
that
one
is
a
card
and
doesn't
affect
the
card
once
that
it
does.
i
think
you
have
to
take
a
general
principle
and
tie
the
two
together
to
the
case
to
understand
which
way
they're
going.
i
don't
think
that
lobue
and
dit-mco
have
completely
reversed
each
other.
i
don't.
i
think
that
if
you
study
the
facts
of
each
case,
they're
different
enough
that
i
think
the
board
in
dictum
they
said
in
effect
they
are
reversing
it
themselves.
but
i
don't
think
they
were
really
doing
it
for
that
reason.
i
think
it
was
based
on
the
facts
of
the
two
separate
cases.
but
i
think
you're
in
a
position
--
this
court
is
in
a
position
where
it
have
to
determine
if
they're
going
to
set
a
full
principle
of
what
can
be
done
or
what
cannot
be
done
by
the
union
in
regard
to
an
election.
they
have
to
set
down
whether
the
board
is
acting
arbitrarily.
they
have
to
make
that
decision.
and
i
see
that
there
is
as
certain
commitment
that
means
something
would
having
to
sign
that
card
that
the
nlrb
wants
to
ignore
that
and
say,
"well,
a
man
can
sign
a
card
and
yet
he
can
vote
against
the
union
and
the
signing
of
the
card
means
nothing."
i
think
the
fact
that
he
is
coerced
into
signing
that
card
is
some
kind
of
a
moral
principle
or
he
may
not
want
to
abide
by
but
he
has
to,
to
protect
himself
and
it
may
be
against
his
own
brain
or
against
his
integrity.
and
i
see
that's
not
giving
him
a
free
choice
and
the
full
freedom
in
the
right
of
having
an
election.
secondly,
there's
a
good
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
obtaining
of
this
card
isn't
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
itself.
under
section
158
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
there,
"the
expressing
of
any
views,
arguments
or
opinions,
or
the
dissemination
thereof
whether
in
written,
printed,
or
graphic
or
visual
form,
shall
not
constitute
of
the
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
subchapter,
if
such
expressions
contains
no
threat
of
reprisal
or
force
or
promise
of
a
benefit."
well,
he
is
asked
to
sign
something
here
and
he
certainly
is
either
under
the
threat
of
reprisal
in
my
set
of
facts
because
he
was
told
the
threatening
of
the
fine,
or
he
was
given
some
kind
of
a
benefit.
and
if
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
then
it
certainly
doesn't
give
the
man
the
freedom
of
choice
and
i
think
for
that
reason
that
there's
another
reason
that
this
is
an
arbitrary
decision
on
the
board
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
they
did.
now,
there's
a
second
issue
in
my
case
that's
a
secondary
issue.
however,
it's
one
that
i'm
very
concerned
with
because
i
was
involved
in
it
and
i
think
the
regional
director
has
a
certain
obligation
to
investigate
and
make
sure
that
this
election
is
held
and
that
this
election
is
held
under
the
conditions
that
there
is
freedom
of
choice.
we
filed
objections
to
the
election
for
objections
and
at
the
hearing,
there
was
no
evidence
produced
as
to
objections
number
three
as
to
certain
promises
were
given
to
the
employee.
there
was
a
letter
received
by
the
district
director
of
the
nlrb
from
an
employee
in
which
he
said
that
he
alleged
a
certain
conduct
that
have
been
set
forth
was
not
necessarily
be
grounds
for
setting
the
election
sides,
as
the
buying
of
this
or
the
union's
promises
of
what
it
would
accomplish
if
it
were
to
be
selected
as
the
bargaining
agent.
they
replied
to
that
letter
and
said
in
effect
that
there
is
--
mr.
ridley
was
not
a
party
of
the
proceedings
and
his
objections
were
not
timely
filed,
and
that
what
was
in
there
appeared
to
be
extraneous
to
the
objections
filed
to
the
company.
well,
i
think
that
there
are
two
things
that
they
violated
there.
one,
i
don't
think
they
can
hide
it
behind
the
technical
requirement
that
the
party
be
the
company
or
the
union
to
file
objections.
i
think
that
once
they
have
had
a
letter
like
that,
that
alludes
directly
to
the
objections
that
they
should
bring
that
person
in
or
at
least
allow
him
or
tell
him
or
notify
him
that
he
can
appear
at
that
hearing.
i
think
there's
a
second
obligation,
on
their
part,
to
notify
the
company
or
the
union
of
this
objection.
and
that
they
--
of
this
employees
--
so
they
can
investigate
it
at
that
point
to
determine
whether
in
fact,
there
was
some
conduct
that
went
on
that
should
be
investigated
to
make
sure
that
there
was
a
fair
and
an
impartial
election.
and
since
there
was
no
investigation,
they
did
not
allow
this
man
to
appear
in
effect
by
not
telling
that
he
had
a
chance
to
appear
that
they
cannot
certify
this
union
as
the
bargainer.
i
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
my
name
is
robert
solner.
i'm
the
attorney
representing
savair
manufacturing
company.
they're
a
small
manufacturing
concern
located
in
warren,
michigan.
there
are
two
issues
in
this
particular

and
of

the

because

this

as
i
see
this
issue,
involves
several
cases
that
involve
a

of

in

position
in
that
regard.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
this
was
where
they
obtained
the
card
on
economic
inducement
and
based
it
on
the
outcome
of
the
election.
for
those
people
that
signed
the
card
and
i'd
say
that's
a
moral
commitment
that
that
person
is
asked
to
make
based
on
an
economic
inducement.
in
other
words,
he
has
him
sign
the
application,
the
union
representative
and
say
now,
"okay,
you
made
a
commitment
to
have
these
union
representatives."
the
side
of
this
card
is
definitely,
i
think,
material
to
the
union's
position
of
wanting
this
commitment
because
it
leaves
the
employee
absolutely
no
alternative.
he
cannot
afford
not
to
sign
the
card
because
if
he
doesn't
sign
the
card
and
the
union
is
elected
then
he
is
penalized.
secondly,
if
he
doesn't
show
an
interest
for
the
union
when
he
is
asked
to
sign
a
card,
then
he
may
feel
or
after
the
union
later
when
they
get
in
and
say,
"this
man
didn't
have
the
interest."
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
pressure
put
on
these
fellows
between
the
time
that
the
election
was
scheduled
and
that
final
date
when
that
election
was
held
to
sign
those
cards
because
several
of
them
signed
it
right
at
the
last
day
just
as
a
hedge.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
no,
i
do
not
agree.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
well,
i
think
that
they'll
have
conditions
have
to
be
equal
for
both
parties.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
be
equal
for
the
employer
or
the
union.
but
they
have
to
be
clear
of
a
free
choice.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
that's
correct.
that's
what
i'm
--
mr.
robert
j.
solner
that's
my
position
would
be.
that
it
have
to
be
a
matter
of
law.
that
it
should
be
free,
they
should
have
--
that
all
parties
should
be
equal
in
that
treatment.
and
that
there's
no
difference
if
the
--
i
cannot
picture
an
employer
being
able
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
saying,
we
want
to
show
you
our
strength
so
we'll
ask
a
man
to
come
off
the
line,
come
in
and
sign
a
petition
to
say
that
we
don't
want
the
union.
(voice
overlap)
that
employee
would
never
exercise
it.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
oh,
no!
certainly,
they
have,
the
board
has
the
right.
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
the
law.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
well,
if
the
board
is
charged
with
the
duty
to
conduct
an
election
under
conditions
which
give
employees
the
freedom
of
choice
and
if
the
board
is
setting
those
standards
does
that,
then
i
assume
that
the
court
can
interfere.
what
i'm
saying
under
these
facts
however,
is
that
they
didn't
give
them
that.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
i
think
so.
yes.
you
have
to
interpret
the
act
to
say
that
this
act
gives
a
certain
obligation
on
that
board.
and
if
that
board
doesn't
follow
the
act
and
isn't
following
the
act,
then
it's
a
matter
of
law
that
they're
not
following
the
act.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
solner
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
cases
in
which
they
reversed
themselves,
i'm
inclined
to
think
it
could.
it
could
because
they
do
say
in
effect
that
one
is
a
card
and
doesn't
affect
the
card
once
that
it
does.
i
think
you
have
to
take
a
general
principle
and
tie
the
two
together
to
the
case
to
understand
which
way
they're
going.
i
don't
think
that
lobue
and
dit-mco
have
completely
reversed
each
other.
i
don't.
i
think
that
if
you
study
the
facts
of
each
case,
they're
different
enough
that
i
think
the
board
in
dictum
they
said
in
effect
they
are
reversing
it
themselves.
but
i
don't
think
they
were
really
doing
it
for
that
reason.
i
think
it
was
based
on
the
facts
of
the
two
separate
cases.
but
i
think
you're
in
a
position
--
this
court
is
in
a
position
where
it
have
to
determine
if
they're
going
to
set
a
full
principle
of
what
can
be
done
or
what
cannot
be
done
by
the
union
in
regard
to
an
election.
they
have
to
set
down
whether
the
board
is
acting
arbitrarily.
they
have
to
make
that
decision.
and
i
see
that
there
is
as
certain
commitment
that
means
something
would
having
to
sign
that
card
that
the
nlrb
wants
to
ignore
that
and
say,
"well,
a
man
can
sign
a
card
and
yet
he
can
vote
against
the
union
and
the
signing
of
the
card
means
nothing."
i
think
the
fact
that
he
is
coerced
into
signing
that
card
is
some
kind
of
a
moral
principle
or
he
may
not
want
to
abide
by
but
he
has
to,
to
protect
himself
and
it
may
be
against
his
own
brain
or
against
his
integrity.
and
i
see
that's
not
giving
him
a
free
choice
and
the
full
freedom
in
the
right
of
having
an
election.
secondly,
there's
a
good
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
obtaining
of
this
card
isn't
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
itself.
under
section
158
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
there,
"the
expressing
of
any
views,
arguments
or
opinions,
or
the
dissemination
thereof
whether
in
written,
printed,
or
graphic
or
visual
form,
shall
not
constitute
of
the
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
subchapter,
if
such
expressions
contains
no
threat
of
reprisal
or
force
or
promise
of
a
benefit."
well,
he
is
asked
to
sign
something
here
and
he
certainly
is
either
under
the
threat
of
reprisal
in
my
set
of
facts
because
he
was
told
the
threatening
of
the
fine,
or
he
was
given
some
kind
of
a
benefit.
and
if
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
then
it
certainly
doesn't
give
the
man
the
freedom
of
choice
and
i
think
for
that
reason
that
there's
another
reason
that
this
is
an
arbitrary
decision
on
the
board
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
they
did.
now,
there's
a
second
issue
in
my
case
that's
a
secondary
issue.
however,
it's
one
that
i'm
very
concerned
with
because
i
was
involved
in
it
and
i
think
the
regional
director
has
a
certain
obligation
to
investigate
and
make
sure
that
this
election
is
held
and
that
this
election
is
held
under
the
conditions
that
there
is
freedom
of
choice.
we
filed
objections
to
the
election
for
objections
and
at
the
hearing,
there
was
no
evidence
produced
as
to
objections
number
three
as
to
certain
promises
were
given
to
the
employee.
there
was
a
letter
received
by
the
district
director
of
the
nlrb
from
an
employee
in
which
he
said
that
he
alleged
a
certain
conduct
that
have
been
set
forth
was
not
necessarily
be
grounds
for
setting
the
election
sides,
as
the
buying
of
this
or
the
union's
promises
of
what
it
would
accomplish
if
it
were
to
be
selected
as
the
bargaining
agent.
they
replied
to
that
letter
and
said
in
effect
that
there
is
--
mr.
ridley
was
not
a
party
of
the
proceedings
and
his
objections
were
not
timely
filed,
and
that
what
was
in
there
appeared
to
be
extraneous
to
the
objections
filed
to
the
company.
well,
i
think
that
there
are
two
things
that
they
violated
there.
one,
i
don't
think
they
can
hide
it
behind
the
technical
requirement
that
the
party
be
the
company
or
the
union
to
file
objections.
i
think
that
once
they
have
had
a
letter
like
that,
that
alludes
directly
to
the
objections
that
they
should
bring
that
person
in
or
at
least
allow
him
or
tell
him
or
notify
him
that
he
can
appear
at
that
hearing.
i
think
there's
a
second
obligation,
on
their
part,
to
notify
the
company
or
the
union
of
this
objection.
and
that
they
--
of
this
employees
--
so
they
can
investigate
it
at
that
point
to
determine
whether
in
fact,
there
was
some
conduct
that
went
on
that
should
be
investigated
to
make
sure
that
there
was
a
fair
and
an
impartial
election.
and
since
there
was
no
investigation,
they
did
not
allow
this
man
to
appear
in
effect
by
not
telling
that
he
had
a
chance
to
appear
that
they
cannot
certify
this
union
as
the
bargainer.
i
thank
you
very
much.
