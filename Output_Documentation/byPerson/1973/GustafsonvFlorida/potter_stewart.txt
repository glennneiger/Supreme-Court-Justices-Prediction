justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
you
already
have
been
interrupted,
may
i
do
it
again
just
so
i
can
understand
this,
i
think
i
do
that
do
i
understand
correctly
that
--
that
in
this
case,
you
do
not
question
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
so,
in
this
case,
we
proceed
on
the
premise
that
the
arrest
was
upon
probable
cause
and
was
constitutionally
a
valid
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
sir.
justice
potter
stewart
it
gets
back
to
my
question.
i
understood
that
there
was
no
question
or
whatsoever
in
this
case
the
way
you
are
arguing
and
as
to
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
arrest
--
justice
potter
stewart
normal
or
abnormal,
that
you
do
not
question
its
validity?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whatever
our
problems
might
be
and
i
confess
that
i
share
my
brother
marshall’s
problems.
i
understand
that’s
just
simply
not
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
rabinowitz
already
had
been
disapproved?
justice
potter
stewart
we
don’t
need
to
do
it
again,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
russ,
i
think
my
brother
white
has
already
pointed
out
that
you
are
kind
of
assuming
the
answer
to
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
are
you
not?
the
question
is,
when
there
is
a
lawful
arrest,
a
lawful
arrest,
perfectly
constitutional
full
arrest
whether,
when
the
offense’s
is
--
is
an
offense
such
as
this,
the
arresting
officer
is
limited
to
a
terry
type
search,
that’s
the
basic
question,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
instead
of
arguing
that,
you’re
rather
arguing
that
you
assume
that
he
is
limited
to
a
terry
type
search
and
now
you
are
arguing
that
a
terry
type
search
would
not
permit
taking
that
box
out
of
his
pocket
which
is
subsidiary
and
somewhat
different
question.
but
the
basic
question
is,
whether
this
search
is
limited
to
a
terry
type
search,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
other
reasons
come
into
play
before
a
man
is
put
on
the
cell
and
they
want
to
take
his
money
out
of
his
pockets
for
instance
and
there
are
various
other
things
and
make
an
inventory
out
of
it
for
the
protection
of
his
property
and
protection
against
false
claims
against
the
police
where
you’re
taking
his
property
and
so
on,
there
are
all
sort
of
different
grounds.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
policeman
did
find
razorblades
in
the
pack
of
the
cigarettes,
it
would
put
him
on
the
alert
that
he
better
do
some
more
searching,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
very
good
point
under
that
theory
of
opening
up
the
package?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
cite
on
your
brief
about
those
things
--
that
issue
isn’t
in
this
case,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
legal
in
florida
to
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
yes
in
answer
to
his
question.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
reason
is
that,
if
an
officer
arrested
somebody
who
he
saw
as
an
eyewitness
holding
another
person
up
and
searched
him,
the
same
claim
could
be
made
that
no
search
of
that
person
could
educe
any
additional
evidence
of
the
holdup,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
same
argument
could
be
made
against
you
that
the
search
would
have
to
be
a
limited
one
because
nothing
that
could
be
found
on
that
person’s
pockets
would
give
any
additional
evidence
of
that
particular
holdup
that
the
officer
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
in
your
brief,
you’re
rather
making
the
same
argument
it
seems
to
me
and
you
suggested
it
in
your
oral
argument,
i.e.
that
this
particular
search
may
have
been
justified
because
you
thought
the
man
was
drunk?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
your
argument
was
and
constitutionally
ought
to
be
that
justice
brennan
has
outlined
it
that
when
there
is
a
constitutionally
valid
arrest,
there
can
be
a
complete
search.
regardless
of
what
the
arrest
is
for
(voice
overlap)
arrest
of
the
man
to
take
him
down
to
the
station
house
in
a
police
car?
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
making
this
argument
only
if
we
reject
your
broader
argument,
aren’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
inviting
us
to
say
that
the
law
is
that
the
scope
of
the
arrest
depends
upon
the
particular
evidence
in
a
particular
circumstances
of
what
the
officer
saw
before
you
arrested
him.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
of
event
in
this
particular
case
there
was
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
it’s
still
a
constitutional
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
you

do
