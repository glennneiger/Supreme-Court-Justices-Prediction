justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
time
of
day
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
separate
things?
does
the
opening
of
the
cigarette
box
in
your
submission
created
a
different
problem
than
going
into
his
pocket
and
taking
the
box?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don’t
argue
that
even
of
that
were
alright,
opening
the
cigarette
box
was
improper?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
a
soft
benson
and
hedges
pack?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
a
hard
box
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
arresting
officer
obviously,
didn’t
know,
did
he?
that
this
was
a
cigarette
box
as
it
had
--
that
the
petitioner
has
--
he
didn’t
know
what
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
after
he
took
it
out,
but
did
he
know
before
he
took
it
out
that
it
was
a
cigarette
box?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
testify
as
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
you
do
concede,
i
gather,
that
the
patdown
was
proper.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
gets
back
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
and
i
gather
under
your
submission.
if
it
had
been
a
different
form,
it
would
have
been
shaped
like
a
gun
or
something
like
that
even
though
it
turned
out
not
to
be
gun
but
a
screwdriver.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
your
case
must
turn
on
that
--
when
he
patted
this
object
inside
his
pocket
not
knowing
what
it
was,
it
did
not
have
the
shape
or
form
of
something
that
might
be
a
weapon
such
as
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you’re
already
assuming
that
the
only
thing
a
person
can
do
is
--
the
officer
can
do
is
to
do
what
he
does
after
a
terry
stop.
so,
here
it
was
a
valid
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
chimel
said
that
you
could
have
search
the
person
of
the
arrestee
and
his
immediate
vicinity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
think
you
answered
me
earlier
that
you
don’t
argue
independently
of
putting
his
hand
in
the
pocket
--
that
opening
the
package
in
and
of
itself
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
you
don’t
argue
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
suggest
that
this
is
no
different
and
had
the
officer
seemed
this
petitioner
holding
someone
up
and
arrested
him
were
attempted
armed
robbery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
maybe
different
but
(voice
overlap)
you’re
suggesting
in
respect
of
the
legality
of
the
search
incident
to
the
arrest,
it
is
no
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
so
long
as
there
is
a
proper
arrest,
whatever
might
be
the
offense
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
this
kind
of
search
is
permissible,
that's
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
would
suppose
on
your
argument
it’s
quite
irrelevant.
as
long
as
he
is
making
a
lawful
arrest,
then
this
is
a
lawful
incidental
search
without
a
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
whether
he’s
afraid
or
not
afraid,
that
is
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don’t
say
you
agree.
i
don’t
suggest
that
that’s
my
view
of
it.
that’s
your
position.
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
the
difficulty
with
this
argument
that
he
was
not
arrested
for
intoxication
or
whatever
you
may
want
to
call.
he
was
arrested
only
for
not
having
a
driver’s
license.
so,
this
then
again
doesn’t
it
has
to
turn
on
the
scope
of
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
for
whatever
reason
he
may
have
been
arrested
as
long
as
the
arrest
was
lawful?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
we’re
not
--
we’re
concerned
here
as
i
understood
it
whether
a
search
is
incidental
that's
claimed
and
indeed
conceded
to
a
lawful
arrest,
namely,
an
arrest
for
not
having
a
driver’s
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
what
this
case
is
and
isn't
that
what
we
have
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
a
suggestion
that
we
do
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
in
the
first
place.
if
you’re
right
on
the
second,
we
can
sustain
this
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
reaching
the
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
next?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
time
of
day
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
separate
things?
does
the
opening
of
the
cigarette
box
in
your
submission
created
a
different
problem
than
going
into
his
pocket
and
taking
the
box?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don’t
argue
that
even
of
that
were
alright,
opening
the
cigarette
box
was
improper?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
a
soft
benson
and
hedges
pack?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
a
hard
box
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
arresting
officer
obviously,
didn’t
know,
did
he?
that
this
was
a
cigarette
box
as
it
had
--
that
the
petitioner
has
--
he
didn’t
know
what
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
after
he
took
it
out,
but
did
he
know
before
he
took
it
out
that
it
was
a
cigarette
box?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
testify
as
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
you
do
concede,
i
gather,
that
the
patdown
was

justice
william
j.

well,
this
gets

even

justice
william

well,
then
your

must
turn

that
--
when

patted
this

inside
his

not

alright.
whether

that
is
your
position?
justice
william
j.

don’t
say
you
agree.
i
don’t

[laughter]
