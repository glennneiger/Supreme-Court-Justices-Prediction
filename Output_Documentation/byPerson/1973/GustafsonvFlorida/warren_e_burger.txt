chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
will
hear
the
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
71-1669,
gustafson
against
florida.
mr.
russ,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
have
than
under
a
terry
search
under
the
terry
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
found
on
feeling
the
man’s
pocket
from
the
outside
that
there
was
a
substantial
package
in
there
that
was
firm,
do
you
say
that
he
could
not
go
into
that
pocket
under
the
terry
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
package
could
have
conceivably
qualified
as
a
weapon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
then
you
have
to
say
that
under
no
conceivable
stretch
of
imagination,
this
hard
package
of
the
benson
and
hedges
cigarette
box
could
not
have
been
a
small
pocket-size
automatic
disc
for
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you’re
judging
the
search
by
its
fruits,
are
you
not?
if
it
was
a
gun
it
is
alright
but
if
it
is
heroin,
it’s
not
alright,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
when
he
opened
that
benson
and
hedges
box,
it
is
not
a
pistol,
an
automatic,
as
justice
marshall
suggested,
but
a
folding
knife,
a
rather
common
weapon
that
folds
in
these
three
sections
of
about
two-and-a-half
inches
each.
would
you
say
then
too
that
the
search
was
not
proper,
unreasonable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
now
we
got
his
hand
out
of
the
pocket,
he
got
the
box
out
and
he
finds
a
weapon,
you
say
that's
an
unreasonable
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
is
he
going
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
richard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
richard.
mr.
russ,
you
have
about
seven
minutes
left
and
let
me
begin
with
a
question
to
you.
if
in
the
circumstances
of
this
stop
and
arrest,
in
feeling
the
pocket,
he
had
felt
the
same
package
and
had
withdrawn
it
and
found
that
it
was
a
small
flask
in
which
there
was
some
vodka
or
whiskey,
let’s
assume
vodka
because
he
said
he
smelled
no
whiskey
here,
would
that
bottle
of
vodka,
flask
of
vodka
be
admissible
in
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
a
weaving,
driving
while
intoxicated
charge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now,
when
he
found
--
if
he
found
in
a
hypothetical
question,
the
small
flask
of
vodka,
would
there
not
be
some
connection
between
the
flask
of
vodka
and
the
weaving
or
could
not
the
courts
find
that
there
was
some
connection
between
the
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
conceded
that
it
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
that
flask
while
this
fellow
is
being
tried,
just
to
impound
it
somewhere
and
give
it
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
russ.
thank
you,
mr.
richard.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
will
hear
the
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
71-1669,
gustafson
against
florida.
mr.
russ,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
have
than
under
a
terry
search
under
the
terry
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
found
on
feeling
the
man’s
pocket
from
the
outside
that
there
was
a
substantial
package
in
there
that
was
firm,
do
you
say
that
he
could
not
go
into
that
pocket
under
the
terry
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
package
could
have
conceivably
qualified
as
a
weapon?
chief
justice
warren
e.

(voice

then
you
have
to
say
that
under

this

of

hedges
cigarette
box
could
not
have
been
a

pocket-size
automatic
disc
for

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you’re
judging
the
search
by
its
fruits,
are
you
not?
if
it
was
a
gun
it
is
alright
but
if
it
is
heroin,
it’s
not
alright,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
when
he
opened
that
benson
and
hedges
box,
it
is
not
a

an

but

would

chief

and
now
we
got
his
hand
out
of
the
pocket,
he
got
the
box
out
and
he
finds
a
weapon,
you
say
that's
an
unreasonable
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
is
he
going
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
richard.
chief

e.

thank

on

you
conceded
that
it
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
against
him?
chief

what
do
you
want
to
do
with
