mr.
barry
scott
richard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
add
a
couple
of
facts
to
the
facts
as
presented
by
the
respondent.
at
the
outset,
let
me
point
out
that
the
car
was
driving
back
and
forth
between
the
driving
lane
and
the
passing
lane.
the
defendants,
the
record
reflects,
looked
through
the
rearview
mirror
and
upon
seeing
the
police
officer,
took
evasive
driving
tactics.
they
drove
behind
a
grocery
store
and
on
to
another
street.
in
the
opinion
of
the
officer
in
an
effort
and
in
the
un-contradicted
testimony
of
the
officer,
in
an
effort
to
evade
him,
one
of
the
points
that
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
in
sibron
and
peters
is
an
important
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
a
mens
rea.
yes
sir?
mr.
barry
scott
richard
no,
you
honor.
the
police
officer
indicated
that
at
the
time,
he
saw
--
there
was
conflicting
testimony.
at
one
point,
he
said
that,
at
the
time
of
the
weaving,
he
didn’t
think
that
there
was
a
violation
that
he
stopped
in
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
intoxicated.
at
another
point,
he
said
that
there
may
have
been
a
violation,
but
there
was
no
arrest
for
the
weaving
violation.
he
said,
he
was
stopping
them
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
intoxicated
when
he
saw
the
car
weaving.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
it
may,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
it
may
your
honor
and
we
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
in
fact,
he
had
the
right
to
do
that.
we
submit
that
he
have
the
right
to
search
for
two
reasons.
one
of
them
was
for
a
weapon
and
the
second
one
was
for
marijuana
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
i’d
like
to
delay
my
response
on
that
so
that
i
can
deal
with
the
questions
raised
by
the
respondent.
let
me
just
rapidly
point
out
several
more
facts
that
i
have
not
yet
been
brought
out,
which
i
think
are
important.
after
attempting
to
evade
the
police
officer,
he
was
stopped
and
the
police
officer
testified
that
he
stopped
him
in
order
to
determine
if
he
was
intoxicated
because
the
car
had
been
weaving
in
a
suspicious
fashion.
he
said
that
after
the
respondent
left
the
car,
it
was
his
impression
that
he
was
intoxicated
because
of
his
actions
and
because
of
his
blurry
eyes.
the
officer
said
that
it
was
his
impression
from
observing
him
that
he
was
intoxicated.
another
point
that
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
--
or
let
me
answer
some
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
court
regarding
the
facts.
justice
marshall
mentioned
and
asked
the
question,
“how
can
you
arrest
the
man
for
a
crime
that
you
cannot
convict
him
of?”
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
he
can
be
convicted
of
not
having
a
driver’s
license.
the
police
officer
had
no
way
of
knowing
at
the
time
of
the
rest
whether
or
not
the
man
had
a
driver’s
license.
it
is
true
that
if
the
man
had
it
and
simply
did
not
have
in
his
possession
that
florida
does
not
convict,
but
the
officer
doesn’t
know
that
until
the
man
arrives
in
court.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
the
officer
testified
that
approximately
three
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
don’t
know
the
answer
in
terms
of
the
factual
statistics
your
honor.
it
is
permissible
in
florida,
it
is
lawful
to
arrest
him
for
that
purpose
and
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
where
the
driver
has
an
out
of
state
license
tag
in
his
car
that
is
not
unreasonable
for
the
officer.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
can
tell
your
honor
that
it
is
legal
in
florida
for
the
officer
to
arrest.
the
man
has
committed
a
crime.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
don’t
know
the
statistical
(voice
overlap)
mr.
barry
scott
richard
no
your
honor,
it
is
not.
i
think
again
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
it
is
conceded.
it
is
legal
in
florida
to
arrest
him.
it
is
a
crime
to
drive
in
florida.
i
wouldn’t
imagine
that
most,
if
not
all
states
without
a
driver’s
license
and
what’s
more
your
honor,
i
would
submit
a
serious
crime
when
we
consider
the
fact
that
more
people
die
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
the
record
does
not
reflect
whether
or
not
he
was
handcuffed
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
would
imagine
it
maybe
(voice
overlap)
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
i
must
concede
to
the
court
that
i
do
not
have
a
statistical
analysis
of
the
frequency
with
which
police
officer’s
arrest
or
handcuff.
i
think
that
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
if
i
might
move
on,
your
honor
so
i
don’t
get
hung
up
on
something
i
don’t
know
and
go
on
to
the
things
that
i
definitely
do
know.
let
me
point
out
as
i
said
that
we
are
submitting
two
things
here,
your
honor
that
the
search
was
reasonable
first
for
a
weapon
and
second,
for
the
marijuana.
with
regard
to
the
search
for
a
weapon,
it
was
pointed
out
by
justice
white
and
i
think
this
is
a
critical
point
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
terry,
sibron,
peters
situation.
i
think
that
that’s
critical.
terry,
sibron
established
a
whole
new
concept
and
a
delicate
one.
it
was
an
arrest
without
--
or
rather
a
search
without
probable
cause.
it
was
a
search
without
an
arrest,
something
this
court
has
never
before
permitted
and
the
court
felt
compelled
to
create
some
serious
restrictions
upon
this
delicate
new
area
and
we
concede
that
point.
but
here
we’re
dealing
with
something
that
the
court
has
traditionally
permitted.
search
incident
to
a
concededly,
lawful
arrest
and
that’s
an
important
distinction.
i
would
also
point
out,
your
honors
that
there
is
a
distinction
here
between
the
facts,
not
only
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
lawful
arrest,
but
what
the
officer
was
doing.
in
the
terry,
sibron
situation,
the
officers
would
deal
at
arms
length
on
the
street
for
a
brief
momentary
questioning
period
with
men
who
they
had
the
opportunity
to
completely
concentrate
on.
here
your
honors,
we
are
dealing
with
an
officer
about
to
place
a
man
in
the
backseat
of
a
police
car
to
concentrate
on
his
driving
and
taking
him
under
arrest
of
the
station.
i’d
also
point
out
your
honor,
justice
marshall
asked
whether
there
was
any
fear
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
the
important
point
i
think
here
is
that
--
and
this
is
a
point,
which
is
raised
continually
in
the
argument
of
the
respondent,
the
important
point
is
not
the
nature
or
the
purpose
of
the
arrest,
but
the
fact
of
the
arrest.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
it
is
certainly
different.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that’s
right
your
honor.
i
would
say
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
absolutely.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
absolutely.
and
i
think
the
reason
that
it
must
be
is
that
the
officer
who
arrests
that
man
for
driving
without
a
license
has
no
way
of
knowing
whether
that
same
man
has
committed
five
robberies
before
the
arrest
and
hence
doesn’t
want
to
be
arrested.
the
important
point
here
is
that
he
is
being
arrested
and
there’s
no
way
of
knowing
how
dangerous
the
man
being
arrested
is
and
what
completely
unforeseeable
reasons
he
may
have.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
agree,
your
honor.
yes
sir.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
perhaps
it
would
be
more
appropriate
to
say
yes,
your
honor,
i
hope
the
court
agrees.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes
sir,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
this
goes
to
the
other
issue,
which
is
the
search
for
evidence
as
opposed
to
the
search
for
weapons
which
i'd
like
to,
get
in
just
a
moment.
if
i
can
dwell
on
this
for
one
more
moment,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
reason
this
concerns
me,
is
that
the
respondent
dwells
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
no
fear
here
on
the
part
of
the
officer
of
being
injured
and
that
this
was
a
minor
traffic
violation.
and
of
course,
in
this
court
--
what
he
is
asking
this
court
to
do,
i
think
clearly,
is
impose
for
the
first
time
upon
search
incident
to
arrest
the
new
restrictions
which
the
court
created
in
sibron
and
peters
and
terry.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that’s
an
additional
reason,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that
is
precisely
what
we’re
arguing
and
i
would
agree
with
it.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
important
point
here
is
that
the
court,
the
fear
that
your
honor
raises
is
that
the
officer
will
use
the
arrest
as
a
ruse
to
search
or
to
harass.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
if
your
honor
there
was
a
valid
statute
and
it
were
lawful
to
arrest
the
spitting
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
officer
lawfully
arrested
the
person
and
placed
him
in
the
squad
car
to
take
him
to
the
station,
i
think
it
will
be
perfectly
reasonable,
your
honor.
i
think
the
significant
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
you
need
not
to
spit
on
the
sidewalk
for
one
thing,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
of
course
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well
again,
then
your
honor
--
i
think
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
that
you
fear
that
the
officer
will
use
an
alleged
violation
as
a
ruse
to
search
and
my
response
is
that
the
courts
have
the
obligation
to
determine
that
factor
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case
cited
several
cases
in
which
the
state
of
florida
has
overturned
convictions
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
found
that
the
arrest
was
a
ruse
and
that
in
fact,
there
was
no
good
faith
lawful
arrest.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
and
i
think,
your
honor
that
this
is
the
obligation
of
the
courts
to
determine
and
when
they
determine
this
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
i
think,
i’m
not
asking
for
a
rule
any
broader
than
the
court
has
laid
down
before
and
the
reason
i
think
we
need
to
is
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
admittedly
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
incidence
in
which
the
court
has
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
driving
without
a
license.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think,
your
honor
--
i
think,
your
honor
that
the
court
of
course
can
go
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
crime
is
to
incidental
to
warrant
an
arrest
but
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
okay,
your
honor.
let
me
just
conclude
with
one
sentence
then
and
that
being
that
i
think
the
intent
of
this
court
in
terry
and
sibron
and
peters
was
to
give
the
police
officer
a
broader
flexibility
in
protecting
himself
from
hazards
and
i
think,
if
this
court
were
now
to
impose
the
restrictions
in
terry
and
sibron
and
peters
on
the
search
incident
to
arrest,
the
overall
result
would
be
precisely
the
opposite.
the
officer
would
be
faced
with
a
much
more
hazardous
situation
than
he
ever
had
prior
to
terry
and
sibron.
and
i
think
a
situation,
which
certainly
is
not
warranted
by
the
statistics
which
this
court
cited
in
those
cases
and
in
the
adams
case
regarding
assaults
on
police
officers,
particularly
when
they
approach
automobiles.
your
honors,
if
i
might
then
move
on
to
the
second
point
in
our
argument
and
again,
i
think
it's
not
necessary
since
i
think
that
first
point
sufficiently
justifies
the
search
in
itself.
but
if
i
might
move
on
to
the
second
one,
we
think
in
addition
that
the
officer
here
was
entitled
to
search
for
intoxicants,
and
i
would
remind
the
court
again,
respectfully
that
the
record
clearly
reflects
by
un-contradicted
testimony
that
the
officer
saw
the
defendants,
saw
the
respondents,
weaving
back
and
forth
on
the
highway
at
2
a.m.
in
the
morning,
that
upon
his
approach
behind
them,
they
attempted
to
evade
him
by
leaving
the
highway,
driving
behind
an
alley
in
the
back
of
a
grocery
store
to
another
street.
and
then
when
the
respondent
left
his
car,
he
was
in
the
impression
of
the
officer
intoxicated,
blurry
eyed
and
by
other
actions,
intoxicated.
these
factors
have
been
traditionally
upheld
as
sufficient
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
intoxication.
i
think
that
it
is
important
here
to
note
something
that
the
florida
supreme
court
said.
they
said
that,
“in
today’s
proliferation
of
illegal
drug
use
which
affects
the
faculties,
checking
only
for
liquors
is
no
longer
adequate.”
i
would
suggest,
your
honors
that
that
point
is
well
taken,
particularly
where
the
officer
smelled
no
alcohol,
he
had
the
right
to
attempt
to
find
other
intoxicants,
including
marijuana
and
there’s
no
place
more
reasonable
to
search
for
marijuana
cigarettes
than
in
a
cigarette
box.
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
serious
hazard
on
the
streets
of
a
city
and
i
know
of
no
way,
your
honors
in
which
a
police
officer
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
all
of
the
recent
cases,
adams
and
terry
and
sibron
and
peters,
this
court
has
reflected
its
concern
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
the
critical
point,
your
honor
i
think
is
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
for
intoxication
and
i
think
justice
harlan
made
an
excellent
point
in
peters
in
this
regard,
your
honors
when
he
point
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
i
think
two
things,
your
honor.
that’s
the
first
thing
and
i
think
that
the
state
ought
to
prevail
on
that,
but
the
second
point
which
was
made
in
peters
in
the
concurring
opinion
was
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
in
fact
makes
the
arrest
before
he
searches
so
long
as
there
is
a
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest.
justice
harlan’s
point
was
that
the
man
can’t
be
heard
to
come
before
this
court
and
say,
my
conviction
should
be
reversed
because
he
didn’t
arrest
me
before
he
searched
me
even
though
he
arrested
me
afterwards,
even
though
he
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
me.
now,
your
honors,
the
same
point
exist
here
assuming
the
probable
cause
existed
to
arrest
for
intoxication
and
assuming
that
he
searched
based
upon
the
probable
cause,
even
though
he
may
have
used
the
more
expedient
route
of
arresting
for
not
having
a
driver’s
license,
he
didn’t
have
to
re-arrest
the
man
for
another
crime
he
was
already
arrested.
the
important
point
here
is
not
whether
or
not
he
arrested
him
for
two
things,
but
whether
or
not
he
arrested
him
--
whether
or
not
he
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
for
intoxication.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
of
course
your
honor.
this
argument
is
unnecessary
for
court
never
need
to
get
to
this
argument.
of
course,
your
honor
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think,
your
honor,
i’m
really
saying
that
this
is
only
an
issue
of
incident
to
this
given
case
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
the
question
is
not
when
the
technical
arrest
took
place,
but
one
of
the
probable
cause
to
arrest
existed
in
exigent
circumstances
as
here
where
you
can’t
go
for
a
warrant
and
i
don’t
really
think
there’s
a
constitutional
issue
to
be
changed
here.
all
i
am
saying
to
the
court
is,
should
it
disagree
with
the
state’s
position
on
the
constitutional
issue,
the
first
issue
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
in
this
given
case,
the
conviction
should
be
upheld.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
you
would
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
and
the
case
which
has
been
taken
in
tandem
where
there
was
no,
concededly
no
basis
for
searching
for
evidence
and
we
would
submit
that
even
in
that
case,
the
search
was
reasonable
for
weapons.
so,
the
issue
would
have
to
be
raised
in
one
of
these
cases
and
met.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes
your
honor,
of
course
if
the
issue
is
raised
and
met
in
the
next
one
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
position
then
it
need
not
go
to
the
second
issue
in
this
given
case.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
my
answer
would
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
in
this
specific
case,
i
would
say
no
your
honor
because
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
attorney
for
the
state
of
florida
as
to
what
the
record
shows
in
this
case
on
this
question
of
intoxication.
and
my
reading
of
the
record
and
this
intoxication
claim
has
been
raised
by
the
state
of
florida
for
the
first
time
in
its
brief
before
this
court
after
we’ve
been
to
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
and
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
this
police
officer’s
attention
was
drawn
to
this
automobile
by
the
fact
that
it
weaved
very
slightly
over
a
divider
line,
three
or
four
times
in
the
course
of
three
quarters
of
one
block
that
he
thereafter
followed
this
car
for
another
six
blocks,
having
already
made
a
determination
that
he
was
going
to
stop
the
car
because
of
the
weaving.
and
everything
he
saw
about
the
man,
the
way
he
get
out
of
the
car,
the
way
he
stood,
the
way
he
smelled,
the
way
he
walked,
the
way
he
conducted
himself
objectively
showed
that
the
man
was
sober.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
would
say
this
that
under
our
fact
plotted
here
that
he
arrested
the
man
for
no
driver’s
license
and
then
had
the
terry
patdown,
he
felt
the
flask.
if
he
could
reasonably
and
objectively
say,
i
earnestly
believe
that
that
was
a
weapon
of
some
sort
that
could
be
used
to
hurt
me
or
could
be
used
to
effectuate
an
escape,
then
i
would
concede
that
he
could
thereafter
go
into
the
pocket
and
take
out
the
flask.
now,
whether
he
could
thereafter
open
it
and
determine
what
was
inside,
i
would
say
no.
that
he
had
satisfied
the
element
of
self-protection
by
going
into
the
pocket
and
removing
what
he
honestly
believed
to
be
the
weapon.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
do
not
concede
that
he
would
thereafter
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
open
the
flask
and
determine
what
was
inside
it
without
a
warrant.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
no,
i
think
he
could
go
to
a
magistrate
in
a
court
and
simply
say,
i’ve
seen
this
man
drive
this
way,
i’ve
taken
this
from
his
pocket
under
a
lawful
frisk
and
i
know
ask
for
a
court
approval
upon
a
showing
of
probable
cause
under
oath
to
open
it
and
inquire
what
its
contents
are.
to
just
settle
on
this
intoxication
argument,
i
would
reiterate
by
saying
that
throughout
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer,
it
shows
both
by
his
testimony
and
by
his
actions
the
fact
that
he
didn’t
arrest
him
for
driving
while
intoxicated,
the
fact
that
he
never
searched
the
automobile
for
any
evidence
of
intoxicants.
the
fact
that
he
testified
under
oath
that
he
didn’t
have
enough
evidence
to
charge
him
with
the
most
minor
of
all
offenses
which
was
careless
driving
by
weaving.
they
raise
the
argument
now
raised
by
the
state
of
florida
that
this
search
can
be
justified
under
the
theory
of
intoxication.
thank
you.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
add
a
couple
of
facts
to
the
facts
as
presented
by
the
respondent.
at
the
outset,
let
me
point
out
that
the
car
was
driving
back
and
forth
between
the
driving
lane
and
the
passing
lane.
the
defendants,
the
record
reflects,
looked
through
the
rearview
mirror
and
upon
seeing
the
police
officer,
took
evasive
driving
tactics.
they
drove
behind
a
grocery
store
and
on
to
another
street.
in
the
opinion
of
the
officer
in
an
effort
and
in
the
un-contradicted
testimony
of
the
officer,
in
an
effort
to
evade
him,
one
of
the
points
that
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
in
sibron
and
peters
is
an
important
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
a
mens
rea.
yes
sir?
mr.
barry
scott
richard
no,
you
honor.
the
police
officer
indicated
that
at
the
time,
he
saw
--
there
was
conflicting
testimony.
at
one
point,
he
said
that,
at
the
time
of
the
weaving,
he
didn’t
think
that
there
was
a
violation
that
he
stopped
in
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
intoxicated.
at
another
point,
he
said
that
there
may
have
been
a
violation,
but
there
was
no
arrest
for
the
weaving
violation.
he
said,
he
was
stopping
them
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
intoxicated
when
he
saw
the
car
weaving.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
it
may,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
it
may
your
honor
and
we
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
in
fact,
he
had
the
right
to
do
that.
we
submit
that
he
have
the
right
to
search
for
two
reasons.
one
of
them
was
for
a
weapon
and
the
second
one
was
for
marijuana
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
i’d
like
to
delay
my
response
on
that
so
that
i
can
deal
with
the
questions
raised
by
the
respondent.
let
me
just
rapidly
point
out
several
more
facts
that
i
have
not
yet
been
brought
out,
which
i
think
are
important.
after
attempting
to
evade
the
police
officer,
he
was
stopped
and
the
police
officer
testified
that
he
stopped
him
in
order
to
determine
if
he
was
intoxicated
because
the
car
had
been
weaving
in
a
suspicious
fashion.
he
said
that
after
the
respondent
left
the
car,
it
was
his
impression
that
he
was
intoxicated
because
of
his
actions
and
because
of
his
blurry
eyes.
the
officer
said
that
it
was
his
impression
from
observing
him
that
he
was
intoxicated.
another
point
that
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
--
or
let
me
answer
some
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
court
regarding
the
facts.
justice
marshall
mentioned
and
asked
the
question,
“how
can
you
arrest
the
man
for
a
crime
that
you
cannot
convict
him
of?”
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
he
can
be
convicted
of
not
having
a
driver’s
license.
the
police
officer
had
no
way
of
knowing
at
the
time
of
the
rest
whether
or
not
the
man
had
a
driver’s
license.
it
is
true
that
if
the
man
had
it
and
simply
did
not
have
in
his
possession
that
florida
does
not
convict,
but
the
officer
doesn’t
know
that
until
the
man
arrives
in
court.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
the
officer
testified
that
approximately
three
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
don’t
know
the
answer
in
terms
of
the
factual
statistics
your
honor.
it
is
permissible
in
florida,
it
is
lawful
to
arrest
him
for
that
purpose
and
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
where
the
driver
has
an
out
of
state
license
tag
in
his
car
that
is
not
unreasonable
for
the
officer.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
can
tell
your
honor
that
it
is
legal
in
florida
for
the
officer
to
arrest.
the
man
has
committed
a
crime.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
don’t
know
the
statistical
(voice
overlap)
mr.
barry
scott
richard
no
your
honor,
it
is
not.
i
think
again
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
it
is
conceded.
it
is
legal
in
florida
to
arrest
him.
it
is
a
crime
to
drive
in
florida.
i
wouldn’t
imagine
that
most,
if
not
all
states
without
a
driver’s
license
and
what’s
more
your
honor,
i
would
submit
a
serious
crime
when
we
consider
the
fact
that
more
people
die
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
the
record
does
not
reflect
whether
or
not
he
was
handcuffed
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
would
imagine
it
maybe
(voice
overlap)
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
i
must
concede
to
the
court
that
i
do
not
have
a
statistical
analysis
of
the
frequency
with
which
police
officer’s
arrest
or
handcuff.
i
think
that
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
if
i
might
move
on,
your
honor
so
i
don’t
get
hung
up
on
something
i
don’t
know
and
go
on
to
the
things
that
i
definitely
do
know.
let
me
point
out
as
i
said
that
we
are
submitting
two
things
here,
your
honor
that
the
search
was
reasonable
first
for
a
weapon
and
second,
for
the
marijuana.
with
regard
to
the
search
for
a
weapon,
it
was
pointed
out
by
justice
white
and
i
think
this
is
a
critical
point
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
terry,
sibron,
peters
situation.
i
think
that
that’s
critical.
terry,
sibron
established
a
whole
new
concept
and
a
delicate
one.
it
was
an
arrest
without
--
or
rather
a
search
without
probable
cause.
it
was
a
search
without
an
arrest,
something
this
court
has
never
before
permitted
and
the
court
felt
compelled
to
create
some
serious
restrictions
upon
this
delicate
new
area
and
we
concede
that
point.
but
here
we’re
dealing
with
something
that
the
court
has
traditionally
permitted.
search
incident
to
a
concededly,
lawful
arrest
and
that’s
an
important
distinction.
i
would
also
point
out,
your
honors
that
there
is
a
distinction
here
between
the
facts,
not
only
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
lawful
arrest,
but
what
the
officer
was
doing.
in
the
terry,
sibron
situation,
the
officers
would
deal
at
arms
length
on
the
street
for
a
brief
momentary
questioning
period
with
men
who
they
had
the
opportunity
to
completely
concentrate
on.
here
your
honors,
we
are
dealing
with
an
officer
about
to
place
a
man
in
the
backseat
of
a
police
car
to
concentrate
on
his
driving
and
taking
him
under
arrest
of
the
station.
i’d
also
point
out
your
honor,
justice
marshall
asked
whether
there
was
any
fear
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
the
important
point
i
think
here
is
that
--
and
this
is
a
point,
which
is
raised
continually
in
the
argument
of
the
respondent,
the
important
point
is
not
the
nature
or
the
purpose
of
the
arrest,
but
the
fact
of
the
arrest.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
it
is
certainly
different.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that’s
right
your
honor.
i
would
say
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
absolutely.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
absolutely.
and
i
think
the
reason
that
it
must
be
is
that
the
officer
who
arrests
that
man
for
driving
without
a
license
has
no
way
of
knowing
whether
that
same
man
has
committed
five
robberies
before
the
arrest
and
hence
doesn’t
want
to
be
arrested.
the
important
point
here
is
that
he
is
being
arrested
and
there’s
no
way
of
knowing
how
dangerous
the
man
being
arrested
is
and
what
completely
unforeseeable
reasons
he
may
have.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
agree,
your
honor.
yes
sir.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
perhaps
it
would
be
more
appropriate
to
say
yes,
your
honor,
i
hope
the
court
agrees.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes
sir,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
this
goes
to
the
other
issue,
which
is
the
search
for
evidence
as
opposed
to
the
search
for
weapons
which
i'd
like
to,
get
in
just
a
moment.
if
i
can
dwell
on
this
for
one
more
moment,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
reason
this
concerns
me,
is
that
the
respondent
dwells
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
no
fear
here
on
the
part
of
the
officer
of
being
injured
and
that
this
was
a
minor
traffic
violation.
and
of
course,
in
this
court
--
what
he
is
asking
this
court
to
do,
i
think
clearly,
is
impose
for
the
first
time
upon
search
incident
to
arrest
the
new
restrictions
which
the
court
created
in
sibron
and
peters
and
terry.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that’s
an
additional
reason,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
that
is
precisely
what
we’re
arguing
and
i
would
agree
with
it.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
important
point
here
is
that
the
court,
the
fear
that
your
honor
raises
is
that
the
officer
will
use
the
arrest
as
a
ruse
to
search
or
to
harass.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
if
your
honor
there
was
a
valid
statute
and
it
were
lawful
to
arrest
the
spitting
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
officer
lawfully
arrested
the
person
and
placed
him
in
the
squad
car
to
take
him
to
the
station,
i
think
it
will
be
perfectly
reasonable,
your
honor.
i
think
the
significant
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
you
need
not
to
spit
on
the
sidewalk
for
one
thing,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
of
course
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well
again,
then
your
honor
--
i
think
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
that
you
fear
that
the
officer
will
use
an
alleged
violation
as
a
ruse
to
search
and
my
response
is
that
the
courts
have
the
obligation
to
determine
that
factor
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case
cited
several
cases
in
which
the
state
of
florida
has
overturned
convictions
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
found
that
the
arrest
was
a
ruse
and
that
in
fact,
there
was
no
good
faith
lawful
arrest.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
and
i
think,
your
honor
that
this
is
the
obligation
of
the
courts
to
determine
and
when
they
determine
this
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
i
think,
i’m
not
asking
for
a
rule
any
broader
than
the
court
has
laid
down
before
and
the
reason
i
think
we
need
to
is
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
admittedly
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
incidence
in
which
the
court
has
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
driving
without
a
license.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think,
your
honor
--
i
think,
your
honor
that
the
court
of
course
can
go
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
crime
is
to
incidental
to
warrant
an
arrest
but
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
okay,
your
honor.
let
me
just
conclude
with
one
sentence
then
and
that
being
that
i
think
the
intent
of
this
court
in
terry
and
sibron
and
peters
was
to
give
the
police
officer
a
broader
flexibility
in
protecting
himself
from
hazards
and
i
think,
if
this
court
were
now
to
impose
the
restrictions
in
terry
and
sibron
and
peters
on
the
search
incident
to
arrest,
the
overall
result
would
be
precisely
the
opposite.
the
officer
would
be
faced
with
a
much
more
hazardous
situation
than
he
ever
had
prior
to
terry
and
sibron.
and
i
think
a
situation,
which
certainly
is
not
warranted
by
the
statistics
which
this
court
cited
in
those
cases
and
in
the
adams
case
regarding
assaults
on
police
officers,
particularly
when
they
approach
automobiles.
your
honors,
if
i
might
then
move
on
to
the
second
point
in
our
argument
and
again,
i
think
it's
not
necessary
since
i
think
that
first
point
sufficiently
justifies
the
search
in
itself.
but
if
i
might
move
on
to
the
second
one,
we
think
in
addition
that
the
officer
here
was
entitled
to
search
for
intoxicants,
and
i
would
remind
the
court
again,
respectfully
that
the
record
clearly
reflects
by
un-contradicted
testimony
that
the
officer
saw
the
defendants,
saw
the
respondents,
weaving
back
and
forth
on
the
highway
at
2
a.m.
in
the
morning,
that
upon
his
approach
behind
them,
they
attempted
to
evade
him
by
leaving
the
highway,
driving
behind
an
alley
in
the
back
of
a
grocery
store
to
another
street.
and
then
when
the
respondent
left
his
car,
he
was
in
the
impression
of
the
officer
intoxicated,
blurry
eyed
and
by
other
actions,
intoxicated.
these
factors
have
been
traditionally
upheld
as
sufficient
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
intoxication.
i
think
that
it
is
important
here
to
note
something
that
the
florida
supreme
court
said.
they
said
that,
“in
today’s
proliferation
of
illegal
drug
use
which
affects
the
faculties,
checking
only
for
liquors
is
no
longer
adequate.”
i
would
suggest,
your
honors
that
that
point
is
well
taken,
particularly
where
the
officer
smelled
no
alcohol,
he
had
the
right
to
attempt
to
find
other
intoxicants,
including
marijuana
and
there’s
no
place
more
reasonable
to
search
for
marijuana
cigarettes
than
in
a
cigarette
box.
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
serious
hazard
on
the
streets
of
a
city
and
i
know
of
no
way,
your
honors
in
which
a
police
officer
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
all
of
the
recent
cases,
adams
and
terry
and
sibron
and
peters,
this
court
has
reflected
its
concern
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
the
critical
point,
your
honor
i
think
is
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
for
intoxication
and
i
think
justice
harlan
made
an
excellent
point
in
peters
in
this
regard,
your
honors
when
he
point
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
well,
i
think
two
things,
your
honor.
that’s
the
first
thing
and
i
think
that
the
state
ought
to
prevail
on
that,
but
the
second
point
which
was
made
in
peters
in
the
concurring
opinion
was
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
in
fact
makes
the
arrest
before
he
searches
so
long
as
there
is
a
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest.
justice
harlan’s
point
was
that
the
man
can’t
be
heard
to
come
before
this
court
and
say,
my
conviction
should
be
reversed
because
he
didn’t
arrest
me
before
he
searched
me
even
though
he
arrested
me
afterwards,
even
though
he
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
me.
now,
your
honors,
the
same
point
exist
here
assuming
the
probable
cause
existed
to
arrest
for
intoxication
and
assuming
that
he
searched
based
upon
the
probable
cause,
even
though
he
may
have
used
the
more
expedient
route
of
arresting
for
not
having
a
driver’s
license,
he
didn’t
have
to
re-arrest
the
man
for
another
crime
he
was
already
arrested.
the
important
point
here
is
not
whether
or
not
he
arrested
him
for
two
things,
but
whether
or
not
he
arrested
him
--
whether
or
not
he
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
for
intoxication.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
of
course
your
honor.
this
argument
is
unnecessary
for
court
never
need
to
get
to
this
argument.
of
course,
your
honor
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think,
your
honor,
i’m
really
saying
that
this
is
only
an
issue
of
incident
to
this
given
case
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
think
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
the
question
is
not
when
the
technical
arrest
took
place,
but
one
of
the
probable
cause
to
arrest
existed
in
exigent
circumstances
as
here
where
you
can’t
go
for
a
warrant
and
i
don’t
really
think
there’s
a
constitutional
issue
to
be
changed
here.
all
i
am
saying
to
the
court
is,
should
it
disagree
with
the
state’s
position
on
the
constitutional
issue,
the
first
issue
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
in
this
given
case,
the
conviction
should
be
upheld.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
you
would
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue
and
the
case
which
has
been
taken
in
tandem
where
there
was
no,
concededly
no
basis
for
searching
for
evidence
and
we
would
submit
that
even
in
that
case,
the
search
was
reasonable
for
weapons.
so,
the
issue
would
have
to
be
raised
in
one
of
these
cases
and
met.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
yes
your
honor,
of
course
if
the
issue
is
raised
and
met
in
the
next
one
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
position
then
it
need
not
go
to
the
second
issue
in
this
given
case.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
your
honor,
my
answer
would
--
mr.
barry
scott
richard
in
this
specific
case,
i
would
say
no
your
honor
because
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
attorney
for
the
state
of
florida
as
to
what
the
record
shows
in
this
case
on
this
question
of
intoxication.
and
my
reading
of
the
record
and
this
intoxication
claim
has
been
raised
by
the
state
of
florida
for
the
first
time
in
its
brief
before
this
court
after
we’ve
been
to
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
and
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
this
police
officer’s
attention
was
drawn
to
this
automobile
by
the
fact
that
it
weaved
very
slightly
over
a
divider
line,
three
or
four
times
in
the
course
of
three
quarters
of
one
block
that
he
thereafter
followed
this
car
for
another
six
blocks,
having
already
made
a
determination
that
he
was
going
to
stop
the
car
because
of
the
weaving.
and
everything
he
saw
about
the
man,
the
way
he
get
out
of
the
car,
the
way
he
stood,
the
way
he
smelled,
the
way
he
walked,
the
way
he
conducted
himself
objectively
showed
that
the
man
was
sober.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
would
say
this
that
under
our
fact
plotted
here
that
he
arrested
the
man
for
no
driver’s
license
and
then
had
the
terry
patdown,
he
felt
the
flask.
if
he
could
reasonably
and
objectively
say,
i
earnestly
believe
that
that
was
a
weapon
of
some
sort
that
could
be
used
to
hurt
me
or
could
be
used
to
effectuate
an
escape,
then
i
would
concede
that
he
could
thereafter
go
into
the
pocket
and
take
out
the
flask.
now,
whether
he
could
thereafter
open
it
and
determine
what
was
inside,
i
would
say
no.
that
he
had
satisfied
the
element
of
self-protection
by
going
into
the
pocket
and
removing
what
he
honestly
believed
to
be
the
weapon.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
i
do
not
concede
that
he
would
thereafter
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
open
the
flask
and
determine
what
was
inside
it
without
a
warrant.
mr.
barry
scott
richard
no,
i
think
he
could
go
to
a
magistrate
in
a
court
and
simply
say,
i’ve
seen
this
man
drive
this
way,
i’ve
taken
this
from
his
pocket
under
a
lawful
frisk
and
i
know
ask
for
a
court
approval
upon
a
showing
of
probable
cause
under
oath
to
open
it
and
inquire
what
its
contents
are.
to
just
settle
on
this
intoxication
argument,
i
would
reiterate
by
saying
that
throughout
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer,
it
shows
both
by
his
testimony
and
by
his
actions
the
fact
that
he
didn’t
arrest
him
for
driving
while
intoxicated,
the
fact
that
he
never
searched
the
automobile
for
any
evidence
of
intoxicants.
the
fact
that
he
testified
under
oath
that
he
didn’t
have
enough
evidence
to
charge
him
with
the
most
minor
of
all
offenses
which
was
careless
driving
by
weaving.
they
raise
the
argument
now
raised
by
the
state
of
florida
that
this
search
can
be
justified
under
the
theory
of
intoxication.
thank
you.
