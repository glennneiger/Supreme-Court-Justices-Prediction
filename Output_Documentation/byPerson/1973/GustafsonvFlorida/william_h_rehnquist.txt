well,
certainly
those
languages
of
both
rabinowitz

preston
that
your
opposing
counsel
cite
that
says
categorically,
that
you
can
have
a
full
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule

that

how
about
protecting
himself
against
the
possible
weapon
that
might
be
concealed
in
the
box.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
officer
can’t
and
just
because
he
uncovers
out
an
object
that
could
contain
a
weapon,
but
that
he
cannot
show
in
advance
that
probably
it
contains
a
weapon,
he
can’t
go

mr.
russ,
what
if
the
policeman
on
searching
does
find
something
that
seems
like
a
revolver
and
the
man
pulls
it
out
and
that
there
with
the
revolver
finds
two
or
three
nickel
packages
of
heroine.
may
he
seize
those
and
charge
the
man
with
possession
of
heroin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
following
a
frisk
or
a
search,
whatever
you
may
call
it
in
the

of
your
man?

i
don’t
think
that’s
involved
here.
it
doesn’t
bother
me
that
you
do
not
have
that
statistics.
