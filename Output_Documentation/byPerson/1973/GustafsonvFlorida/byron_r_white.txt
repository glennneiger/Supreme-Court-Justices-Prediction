and
a
part
of
that
is
that
you
concede
the
validity
of
the
stock
--
justice
byron

white
and
then
the
validity
of
the
arrest
based
on
(inaudible).
justice

i
suppose
that
you’ll
be
making
the
same
argument
if
this
defendant
have
been
arrested
in
his
home
for
stealing
television
sets
and
assume
there’s
a
valid
arrest
to
that
and
probable
cause.
they
went
into
the
house
and
properly
arrested
the
man
and
then
took
a
benson
and
hedges
box
out
of
his
pocket
and
looked
in
it.
justice
byron

what
kinds
of
proofs
were
within
--
found
in
a
benson
and
hedges
box
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
basis,
there
could
be
a
driver’s
license
in
the
cigarette
box,
you
can
argue
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
he
may
have
lied
about
his
identity
like
you
could
have
found
anything
in
the
cigarette
box?
justice
byron

like
deny
the
ownership
of
the
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to
get
over
another
point
though,
this
terry
type
of
stop,
you
concede
that
this
was
an
arrest
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
question
of
search
incident
to
arrest
as
the
terry
patdown.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
do
you
keep
razorblades,
for
example?
i
mean,
if
you’re
going
to
have
a
terry
type
stop,
you
are
going
to
ask
to
a
couple
of
questions
for
a
few
moments.
it
might
be
reasonable
to
say,
if
you
only
patdown
for
weapons,
it
might
be
drawn
and
used
on
the
officer
like
a
gun
or
something.
if
you
are
going
to
put
a
man
on
the
police
car
and
take
him
to
the
station
and
things
like
that,
shouldn’t
you
be
more
careful
about
weapons
and
evidence?
what
about
a
razor
blade
for
instance?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
can
keep
that
anywhere,
can’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
not
be
able
to
search
for
razor
blades
in
the
terry
type
stop,
but
can’t
search
for
razorblades
if
you
make
a
valid
arrest
and
put
him
on
a
police
car
and
take
him
to
the
station?
justice
byron
r.

alright,
let’s
assume
it
gets
to
the
station
before
they
put
him
in
a
cell,
can
they
search
his
pockets?
justice
byron
r.

alright
(voice

but
they
get
him
to
the
station,
they’re
going
to
book
him
and
they’re
going
to
take
the
photograph
of
him
and
can
they
ask
him
down
to
empty
his
pockets
there?
justice
byron

white
why
can’t
they
make
him
empty
his
pockets
when
they
put
him
in
the
jail,
put
him
on
a
cell?
justice
byron

because
he
might
have
a
razorblades
or
something
like
that
or
some
other
