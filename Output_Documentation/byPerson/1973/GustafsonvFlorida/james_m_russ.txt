mr.
james
m.
russ
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
james
russ.
i
represent
the
petitioner
james
gustafson.
this
is
an
action
of
certiorari
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
this
is
a
case
involving
a
felony
conviction
of
the
charge
of
possession
of
marijuana
and
the
case
we
bring
to
this
court
involves
a
search
and
seizure
fourth
amendment
question.
the
specific
question
is,
involves
warrantless
body
search
and
seizure
of
a
motorist
who
was
arrested
on
a
minor
traffic
violation.
and
the
basic
facts
are
that
in
january
of
1969,
mr.
gustafson
while
driving
his
automobile
was
stopped
by
a
florida
policeman.
he
was
asked
for
a
driver’s
license
and
when
he
advised
the
policeman,
he
did
not
have
his
driver’s
license
in
his
personal
possession,
he
was
placed
under
arrest.
mr.
james
m.
russ
he
stopped
him
because
he
observed
him
to
be
weaving,
justice
rehnquist.
his
testimony
was
that
he
weaved
three
or
four
times
across
a
divider
line
between
one
lane
and
a
second
lane.
mr.
james
m.
russ
this
is
approximately
1:30
to
2
o’clock
in
the
morning,
your
honor.
in
any
event
after
mr.
gustafson
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
that’s
correct,
justice
stewart.
we
are
challenging
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
search
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
russ
for
the
charge
of
driving
an
automobile
with
no
valid
driver’s
license
in
his
possession.
mr.
james
m.
russ
now,
after
he
was
removed
from
the
automobile
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes,
we
do
justice
white.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
and
of
course,
after
he
told
the
police
officer
that
he
did
not
have
his
driver’s
license
with
him,
he
was
then
arrested
for
that
violation.
he
was
taken
out
of
the
car
or
he
got
of
the
car
by
himself
and
he
was
then
spread-eagled
against
the
police
car
where
upon
a
pat-down,
the
police
officer
felt
something
in
his
coat
pocket.
he
put
his
hand
into
his
left
coat
pocket
and
removed
a
box
of
what
appeared
to
be
benson
and
hedges
cigarettes.
at
this
point,
he
put
mr.
gustafson
in
the
backseat
of
his
patrol
car
and
that
there
was
a
passenger
with
mr.
gustafson,
mr.
moody
and
the
second
police
officer
had
arrived,
officer
levee.
and
at
this
point
in
time
he
told
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
the
police
officer,
lieutenant
smith.
he
had
physical
possession.
he
opened
--
apparently
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
later
in
the
interim
--
he
had
advised
the
passenger
to
go
ahead
and
drive
off
gustafson’s
automobile
to
follow
them
to
the
police
station
and
then
told
officer
levee
to
check
mr.
moody
to
make
sure
that
he
had
a
valid
driver’s
license.
then
when
he
opened
up
the
box
of
benson
and
hedges
and
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
curiosity,
justice
marshall,
i
assume.
there
was
no
legal
justification
for
it.
mr.
james
m.
russ
i
think
it’s
normal
to
arrest
in
this
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
i
don’t
know
specifically.
mr.
james
m.
russ
there
is
no
question.
mr.
james
m.
russ
that’s
right,
because
the
state
law
of
florida
states
that
it’s
an
offense
to
drive
without
a
valid
driver’s
license
in
your
possession
is
sort
of
an
inchoate
offense,
but
there
was
a
back
door
to
this
thing
that
if
you
appear
in
court
with
your
valid
driver’s
license
at
a
later
date,
then
the
whole
matter
is
dismissed.
mr.
james
m.
russ
justice
powell,
it
had
the
new
york
license
on
it.
in
any
event,
the
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
justice
marshall,
i
have
problems
with
it
too
but
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
because
we
think
that
the
key
issue
in
this
case
for
this
court’s
consideration
is
the
matter
of
the
scope
of
the
search.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
we
want
to
win
it
one
way
or
another.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
yes,
sir.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
we
see
it,
is
the
scope
and
the
intensity
of
a
custodial
body
search
which
is
made
incidental
to
a
warrantless
arrest
for
an
evidenceless
minor
traffic
offense,
limited
by
the
reasonless
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
sir.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir
and
we’re
complaining
essentially
about
the
search,
the
body
search,
the
going
into
the
man’s
pocket
and
the
taking
out
of
the
cigarette
box
and
the
opening
of
the
cigarette
box.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
the
constitutional
wrong
in
this
set
of
circumstances
occurred
when
the
police
officer
put
his
hand
into
the
man’s
pocket
and
took
out
the
cigarette
box.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
that
is
just
for
the
compounding
of
the
wrong,
yes
sir,
but
our
essential
complaint
is
that
going
into
the
pocket,
the
body
search.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don’t
believe
so.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
we
say
that
under
the
terry
case,
he
has
to
have
a
reason
to
believe
that
what
he
feels
is
of
such
substance
that
it
could
qualify
as
a
weapon.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
james
m.
russ
it
was
a
box
as
i
understand
it,
justice
brennan
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
not
necessarily
justice
white.
it’s
our
essential
contention
as
regards
to
search
for
evidence
that
it
is
proper
for
the
police
officer
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
to
search
for
the
fruits,
instrumentalities
and
evidence
of
the
offense
upon
which
the
arrested
is
based.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
sir.
(voice
overlap)
no,
but
we
don’t
know
what
the
circumstances
of
your
hypothetical
theft
is.
it
could
be
--
there
could
have
been
a
screw
driver
that
was
associated
with
the
break
in,
there
could
be
an
invoice
associated
with
the
television.
mr.
james
m.
russ
but
he
wasn’t
charged
with
having
a
driver’s
license,
he
was
charged
with
not
having
a
driver’s
license.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
we
submit
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
we
submit
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
police
officer
doesn’t
have
the
authority
to
search
for
anything.
he
has
the
authority
in
a
body
search
to
search
only
for
the
fruits,
instrumentalities
and
evidence
related
to
the
offense
upon
which
the
arrest
is
based.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
they
always
refer
to
it
in
the
sworn
testimony
as
being
a
cigarette
box,
justice
brennan.
mr.
james
m.
russ
i
don’t
know.
mr.
james
m.
russ
the
specific
question
was
never
asked
of
him.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
we
concede
and
part
of
our
submission
is
that
in
such
a
situation
where
you
have
an
arrest
for
like
our
case,
a
minor
traffic
offense
where
there
is
no
evidence
involved
with
the
offense,
there
are
no
fruits
or
instrumentalities
associated
with
the
offense,
that
it
is
still
proper
under
an
extension
of
charity
for
the
arresting
officer
for
his
own
self
protection
and
to
aviate
the
problems
of
potential
escape
to
patdown
in
a
terry-type
frisk,
the
arrest
prior
to
putting
him
into
the
police
car
of
taking
him
to
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
let
us
say
it
was
a
peters
case
where
the
arresting
or
the
searching
officer,
the
frisking
officer
felt
something
hard
and
substantial
in
the
man’s
pocket
in
which
he
thought
might
have
been
a
knife.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
that
was
proper
for
him
to
--
after
the
frisk
to
go
into
his
pocket
and
bring
out
what
turned
to
be
kind
of
a
mini
burglar
tool
set.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir,
that
is
our
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
your
honor,
as
we
read
terry,
sibron
and
peters
it’s
our
understanding
of
those
cases
that
this
doesn’t
give
a
wide-open
subjective
approach
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer
that
he
can’t
simply
come
to
the
trial
court
afterwards
and
say,
“i
intuitively
or
believe
that
it
might
possibly
had
been
a
weapon
or
one
sort
or
another
that
this
is
something
that
is
subject
to
objective
evaluation,”
otherwise,
the
terry
frisk
is
really
a
wide
open
authority
to
search
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes.
mr.
james
m.
russ
right.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
that
was
--
the
point
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
relationship
for
the
reason
for
the
arrest.
mr.
james
m.
russ
your
honor
as
we
read
chimel,
chimel
again
in
that
same
section
of
the
opinion
quoted
from
the
terry
decision
where
this
court
said
that
“the
scope
of
the
search
must
be
strictly
tied
to
and
justified
by
the
circumstances
which
rendered
the
initiation
permissible.”
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
sir.
we
are
asking
this
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
attribute
to
the
police
officer
any
legal
authority
to
open
the
package
once
he
takes
it
out
of
the
man’s
pocket.
mr.
james
m.
russ
because
i
answered
justice
brennan.
(voice
overlap)no
sir.
i’m
simply
saying
that’s
a
compounding
of
the
constitutional
wrong
that
began
when
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
i
say
that
it
all
falls
in
one
package,
so
i
am
not
giving
it
away,
i
am
not
conceding
it.
i
am
saying
that
from
the
time
that
the
officer
put
his
hand
in
the
man’s
left
coat
pocket
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
from
that
point
on
thereafter.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
--
no,
because
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
your
honor.
[laughter
attempt]
let
me
go
back
over
the
scene
again.
the
point
is
that
on
the
frisk,
if
the
police
--
our
position
is
that
the
police
officer
frisked
under
terry
and
felt
what
he
believed
to
be
objectively
speaking
was
a
weapon,
then
he
have
lawful
authority
in
this
minor
traffic
offense
arrest
to
search
further,
to
remove
the
weapon
from
the
man’s
person
and
to
take
control
of
it.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
i
am
going
back
to
the
basic
--
putting
his
hand
on
the
pocket.
mr.
james
m.
russ
i
say
that
the
opening
of
the
box
is
unreasonable.
i
say
that
taking
the
box
out
of
his
pocket
was
unreasonable
that
there’s
no
rational
connection
between
taking
the
box
out
of
his
pocket
and
the
arrest
for
not
having
a
driver’s
license
in
his
possession.
mr.
james
m.
russ
mr.
rehnquist
--
justice
rehnquist,
we
believe
that
unless
there’s
a
rational
objective,
showing
that,
what
the
officer
feels
on
the
frisk,
is
a
weapon
or
falls
in
that
category
of
an
object
that
could
be
used
to
hurt
the
police
officer
or
the
arrestee
or
to
effectuate
the
escape
that
it
becomes
unreasonable
for
him
to
extend
the
frisk
into
a
body
search.
mr.
james
m.
russ
that’s
our
position,
yes
sir,
because
our
--
the
answer
to
it
is
that,
is
it
was
left
to
the
police
officer’s
own
subjective
interpretation
that
there
might
have
been
a
weapon
in
whatever
this
object
is
that
he
feels
to
the
outer
clothing,
rather
than
an
objective
standard
and
objective
test
that
every
terry
frisk
is
going
to
develop
into
a
full
body
search.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
that’s
our
contention
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
it’s
our
contention
of
the
course
that
appears
--
that
this
is
within
the
concept
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
there
must
be
a
rational
connection
between
the
reason
for
stopping
and
apprehending
the
citizen
and
this
invasion
of
his
privacy.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
justice
white
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes.
if
we
are
going
to
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
if
you
are
going
to
search
for
razorblades,
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
right
down
to
the
very
scene
or
environment.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes.
this
is
assuming
that
they
put
him
on
the
cell,
but
the
answer
of
that
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
not
until
such
time
as
he
goes
from
this
booking
stage
to
being
an
actual
prisoner
in
the
jail
and
of
course,
he
certainly
has
the
option
to
--
as
on
this
case,
to
pose
bail
right
there
at
the
situation.
mr.
james
m.
russ
it
was
a
matter
of
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
whole
jail
system.
mr.
james
m.
russ
some
other
weapon
or
some
other
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
we
don’t
think
that
it
was
necessary
at
all
to
open
a
package
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir,
that’s
true.
mr.
james
m.
russ
so,
are
marijuana
cigarettes
in
this
case,
but
to
answer
justice
white’s
question
so
far
as
the
booking
at
the
jail,
it
doesn’t
absolutely
follow
that
because
a
man
is
arrested
on
the
street
that
he
ends
up
in
the
jail
cell.
particularly
in
this
type
of
motor
vehicle
violation
where
in
the
worst
situation
as
it
occurred
here,
the
man
was
taken
from
the
street
to
the
police
station
or
as
the
officer
testified,
bail
was
set
to
the
amount
of
$50
and
under
normal
circumstances,
he
would
have
been
released
upon
the
posting
of
that
$50
and
there
never
would
have
been
any
searching,
there
never
would
have
been
any
incarceration
on
a
jail
cell.
mr.
james
m.
russ
this
is
following
a
terry
frisk
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes,
sir.
i
would
concede
that.
our
basic
complaint
is
what
followed
after
the
frisk
that
there
should
not
have
been
any
further
intrusion
into
the
man’s
privacy
following
the
terry
frisk
for
weapons.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
russ
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
james
russ.
i
represent
the
petitioner
james
gustafson.
this
is
an
action
of
certiorari
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
this
is
a
case
involving
a
felony
conviction
of
the
charge
of
possession
of
marijuana
and
the
case
we
bring
to
this
court
involves
a
search
and
seizure
fourth
amendment
question.
the
specific
question
is,
involves
warrantless
body
search
and
seizure
of
a
motorist
who
was
arrested
on
a
minor
traffic
violation.
and
the
basic
facts
are
that
in
january
of
1969,
mr.
gustafson
while
driving
his
automobile
was
stopped
by
a
florida
policeman.
he
was
asked
for
a
driver’s
license
and
when
he
advised
the
policeman,
he
did
not
have
his
driver’s
license
in
his
personal
possession,
he
was
placed
under
arrest.
mr.
james
m.
russ
he
stopped
him
because
he
observed
him
to
be
weaving,
justice
rehnquist.
his
testimony
was
that
he
weaved
three
or
four
times
across
a
divider
line
between
one
lane
and
a
second
lane.
mr.
james
m.
russ
this
is
approximately
1:30
to
2
o’clock
in
the
morning,
your
honor.
in
any
event
after
mr.
gustafson
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
that’s
correct,
justice
stewart.
we
are
challenging
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
search
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
russ
for
the
charge
of
driving
an
automobile
with
no
valid
driver’s
license
in
his
possession.
mr.
james
m.
russ
now,
after
he
was
removed
from
the
automobile
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes,
we
do
justice
white.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
and
of
course,
after
he
told
the
police
officer
that
he
did
not
have
his
driver’s
license
with
him,
he
was
then
arrested
for
that
violation.
he
was
taken
out
of
the
car
or
he
got
of
the
car
by
himself
and
he
was
then
spread-eagled
against
the
police
car
where
upon
a
pat-down,
the
police
officer
felt
something
in
his
coat
pocket.
he
put
his
hand
into
his
left
coat
pocket
and
removed
a
box
of
what
appeared
to
be
benson
and
hedges
cigarettes.
at
this
point,
he
put
mr.
gustafson
in
the
backseat
of
his
patrol
car
and
that
there
was
a
passenger
with
mr.
gustafson,
mr.
moody
and
the
second
police
officer
had
arrived,
officer
levee.
and
at
this
point
in
time
he
told
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
the
police
officer,
lieutenant
smith.
he
had
physical
possession.
he
opened
--
apparently
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
later
in
the
interim
--
he
had
advised
the
passenger
to
go
ahead
and
drive
off
gustafson’s
automobile
to
follow
them
to
the
police
station
and
then
told
officer
levee
to
check
mr.
moody
to
make
sure
that
he
had
a
valid
driver’s
license.
then
when
he
opened
up
the
box
of
benson
and
hedges
and
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
curiosity,
justice
marshall,
i
assume.
there
was
no
legal
justification
for
it.
mr.
james
m.
russ
i
think
it’s
normal
to
arrest
in
this
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
i
don’t
know
specifically.
mr.
james
m.
russ
there
is
no
question.
mr.
james
m.
russ
that’s
right,
because
the
state
law
of
florida
states
that
it’s
an
offense
to
drive
without
a
valid
driver’s
license
in
your
possession
is
sort
of
an
inchoate
offense,
but
there
was
a
back
door
to
this
thing
that
if
you
appear
in
court
with
your
valid
driver’s
license
at
a
later
date,
then
the
whole
matter
is
dismissed.
mr.
james
m.
russ
justice
powell,
it
had
the
new
york
license
on
it.
in
any
event,
the
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
justice
marshall,
i
have
problems
with
it
too
but
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
because
we
think
that
the
key
issue
in
this
case
for
this
court’s
consideration
is
the
matter
of
the
scope
of
the
search.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
we
want
to
win
it
one
way
or
another.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
yes,
sir.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
we
see
it,
is
the
scope
and
the
intensity
of
a
custodial
body
search
which
is
made
incidental
to
a
warrantless
arrest
for
an
evidenceless
minor
traffic
offense,
limited
by
the
reasonless
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
sir.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir
and
we’re
complaining
essentially
about
the
search,
the
body
search,
the
going
into
the
man’s
pocket
and
the
taking
out
of
the
cigarette
box
and
the
opening
of
the
cigarette
box.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
the
constitutional
wrong
in
this
set
of
circumstances
occurred
when
the
police
officer
put
his
hand
into
the
man’s
pocket
and
took
out
the
cigarette
box.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
that
is
just
for
the
compounding
of
the
wrong,
yes
sir,
but
our
essential
complaint
is
that
going
into
the
pocket,
the
body
search.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don’t
believe
so.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
we
say
that
under
the
terry
case,
he
has
to
have
a
reason
to
believe
that
what
he
feels
is
of
such
substance
that
it
could
qualify
as
a
weapon.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
james
m.
russ
it
was
a
box
as
i
understand
it,
justice
brennan
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
not
necessarily
justice
white.
it’s
our
essential
contention
as
regards
to
search
for
evidence
that
it
is
proper
for
the
police
officer
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
to
search
for
the
fruits,
instrumentalities
and
evidence
of
the
offense
upon
which
the
arrested
is
based.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
sir.
(voice
overlap)
no,
but
we
don’t
know
what
the
circumstances
of
your
hypothetical
theft
is.
it
could
be
--
there
could
have
been
a
screw
driver
that
was
associated
with
the
break
in,
there
could
be
an
invoice
associated
with
the
television.
mr.
james
m.
russ
but
he
wasn’t
charged
with
having
a
driver’s
license,
he
was
charged
with
not
having
a
driver’s
license.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
we
submit
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
we
submit
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
police
officer
doesn’t
have
the
authority
to
search
for
anything.
he
has
the
authority
in
a
body
search
to
search
only
for
the
fruits,
instrumentalities
and
evidence
related
to
the
offense
upon
which
the
arrest
is
based.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
they
always
refer
to
it
in
the
sworn
testimony
as
being
a
cigarette
box,
justice
brennan.
mr.
james
m.
russ
i
don’t
know.
mr.
james
m.
russ
the
specific
question
was
never
asked
of
him.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
we
concede
and
part
of
our
submission
is
that
in
such
a
situation
where
you
have
an
arrest
for
like
our
case,
a
minor
traffic
offense
where
there
is
no
evidence
involved
with
the
offense,
there
are
no
fruits
or
instrumentalities
associated
with
the
offense,
that
it
is
still
proper
under
an
extension
of
charity
for
the
arresting
officer
for
his
own
self
protection
and
to
aviate
the
problems
of
potential
escape
to
patdown
in
a
terry-type
frisk,
the
arrest
prior
to
putting
him
into
the
police
car
of
taking
him
to
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
let
us
say
it
was
a
peters
case
where
the
arresting
or
the
searching
officer,
the
frisking
officer
felt
something
hard
and
substantial
in
the
man’s
pocket
in
which
he
thought
might
have
been
a
knife.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
that
was
proper
for
him
to
--
after
the
frisk
to
go
into
his
pocket
and
bring
out
what
turned
to
be
kind
of
a
mini
burglar
tool
set.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir,
that
is
our
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
your
honor,
as
we
read
terry,
sibron
and
peters
it’s
our
understanding
of
those
cases
that
this
doesn’t
give
a
wide-open
subjective
approach
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer
that
he
can’t
simply
come
to
the
trial
court
afterwards
and
say,
“i
intuitively
or
believe
that
it
might
possibly
had
been
a
weapon
or
one
sort
or
another
that
this
is
something
that
is
subject
to
objective
evaluation,”
otherwise,
the
terry
frisk
is
really
a
wide
open
authority
to
search
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes.
mr.
james
m.
russ
right.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
that
was
--
the
point
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
relationship
for
the
reason
for
the
arrest.
mr.
james
m.
russ
your
honor
as
we
read
chimel,
chimel
again
in
that
same
section
of
the
opinion
quoted
from
the
terry
decision
where
this
court
said
that
“the
scope
of
the
search
must
be
strictly
tied
to
and
justified
by
the
circumstances
which
rendered
the
initiation
permissible.”
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
sir.
we
are
asking
this
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
attribute
to
the
police
officer
any
legal
authority
to
open
the
package
once
he
takes
it
out
of
the
man’s
pocket.
mr.
james
m.
russ
because
i
answered
justice
brennan.
(voice
overlap)no
sir.
i’m
simply
saying
that’s
a
compounding
of
the
constitutional
wrong
that
began
when
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
i
say
that
it
all
falls
in
one
package,
so
i
am
not
giving
it
away,
i
am
not
conceding
it.
i
am
saying
that
from
the
time
that
the
officer
put
his
hand
in
the
man’s
left
coat
pocket
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
from
that
point
on
thereafter.
mr.
james
m.
russ
no
--
no,
because
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
no,
your
honor.
[laughter
attempt]
let
me
go
back
over
the
scene
again.
the
point
is
that
on
the
frisk,
if
the
police
--
our
position
is
that
the
police
officer
frisked
under
terry
and
felt
what
he
believed
to
be
objectively
speaking
was
a
weapon,
then
he
have
lawful
authority
in
this
minor
traffic
offense
arrest
to
search
further,
to
remove
the
weapon
from
the
man’s
person
and
to
take
control
of
it.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
i
am
going
back
to
the
basic
--
putting
his
hand
on
the
pocket.
mr.
james
m.
russ
i
say
that
the
opening
of
the
box
is
unreasonable.
i
say
that
taking
the
box
out
of
his
pocket
was
unreasonable
that
there’s
no
rational
connection
between
taking
the
box
out
of
his
pocket
and
the
arrest
for
not
having
a
driver’s
license
in
his
possession.
mr.
james
m.
russ
mr.
rehnquist
--
justice
rehnquist,
we
believe
that
unless
there’s
a
rational
objective,
showing
that,
what
the
officer
feels
on
the
frisk,
is
a
weapon
or
falls
in
that
category
of
an
object
that
could
be
used
to
hurt
the
police
officer
or
the
arrestee
or
to
effectuate
the
escape
that
it
becomes
unreasonable
for
him
to
extend
the
frisk
into
a
body
search.
mr.
james
m.
russ
that’s
our
position,
yes
sir,
because
our
--
the
answer
to
it
is
that,
is
it
was
left
to
the
police
officer’s
own
subjective
interpretation
that
there
might
have
been
a
weapon
in
whatever
this
object
is
that
he
feels
to
the
outer
clothing,
rather
than
an
objective
standard
and
objective
test
that
every
terry
frisk
is
going
to
develop
into
a
full
body
search.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
that’s
our
contention
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
it’s
our
contention
of
the
course
that
appears
--
that
this
is
within
the
concept
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
there
must
be
a
rational
connection
between
the
reason
for
stopping
and
apprehending
the
citizen
and
this
invasion
of
his
privacy.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
justice
white
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes.
if
we
are
going
to
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
if
you
are
going
to
search
for
razorblades,
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
right
down
to
the
very
scene
or
environment.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes.
this
is
assuming
that
they
put
him
on
the
cell,
but
the
answer
of
that
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
not
until
such
time
as
he
goes
from
this
booking
stage
to
being
an
actual
prisoner
in
the
jail
and
of
course,
he
certainly
has
the
option
to
--
as
on
this
case,
to
pose
bail
right
there
at
the
situation.
mr.
james
m.
russ
it
was
a
matter
of
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
whole
jail
system.
mr.
james
m.
russ
some
other
weapon
or
some
other
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
russ
well,
we
don’t
think
that
it
was
necessary
at
all
to
open
a
package
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes
sir,
that’s
true.
mr.
james
m.
russ
so,
are
marijuana
cigarettes
in
this
case,
but
to
answer
justice
white’s
question
so
far
as
the
booking
at
the
jail,
it
doesn’t
absolutely
follow
that
because
a
man
is
arrested
on
the
street
that
he
ends
up
in
the
jail
cell.
particularly
in
this
type
of
motor
vehicle
violation
where
in
the
worst
situation
as
it
occurred
here,
the
man
was
taken
from
the
street
to
the
police
station
or
as
the
officer
testified,
bail
was
set
to
the
amount
of
$50
and
under
normal
circumstances,
he
would
have
been
released
upon
the
posting
of
that
$50
and
there
never
would
have
been
any
searching,
there
never
would
have
been
any
incarceration
on
a
jail
cell.
mr.
james
m.
russ
this
is
following
a
terry
frisk
--
mr.
james
m.
russ
yes,
sir.
i
would
concede
that.
our
basic
complaint
is
what
followed
after
the
frisk
that
there
should
not
have
been
any
further
intrusion
into
the
man’s
privacy
following
the
terry
frisk
for
weapons.
thank
you.
