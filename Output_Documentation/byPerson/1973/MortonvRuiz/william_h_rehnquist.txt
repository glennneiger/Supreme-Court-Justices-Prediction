justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
draw
a
line
that
the
bureau
has
generally
between
indians
on
trust
lands
and
indians
on
allotted
lands?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
object
to
this
issue
i
take
it,
unless
we
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit
as
to
their
interpretation
of
the
congressional
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
legislative
history
is
unclear
and
the
statute
is
unclear,
doesn’t
that
give
you
a
fairly
strong
case
for
following
the
administrative
construction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
woods,
you
said
you
brought
an
action
for
mandamus,
this
isn't
the
mandamus
action,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
was
a
--
in
its
form
a
mandamus
action
when
you
brought
before
judge
wolf?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
bia
jurisdiction
i
take
at
extends
throughout
the
50
states,
so
that
what
you
are
contending
for
is,
is
a
right
to
travel
because
of
the
indians'
relationship
to
the
bia,
anywhere
in
the
50
states
different
from
that
of
an
ordinary
citizen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
does
it
depend
on
bia
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
understood
his
question
to
you
to
be
about
someone
who
moved
from
baltimore
county
to
the
eastern
shore
of
maryland,
both
within
maryland
and
i
think
in
dandridge
we
sustained
a
differential
between
baltimore
county
and
other
parts
of
maryland?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
