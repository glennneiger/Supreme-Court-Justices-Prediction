mr.
sachse,
can
i
interrupt
you
there?
suppose
that
this
particular
applicant
was
able
to
work
at
the
mines
but
the
reservation
was
right
across
the
street
and
he
maintained
his
residence
on
the
reservation,
would
he
have
been
eligible
under
some
other
program
at
that
time?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
his
white
counterpart
would
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
situation
as
to
a
person
who
lives
on
a
reservation,
is
he
eligible
generally
for
state
or
federal
welfare
type
programs?
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
that
your
opponents
do
not
necessarily
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it
the
strike
has
long
--
as
since
over.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
are
distinguishable
on
the
basis
of
their
residence
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
a
distinction?
justice
potter
stewart
a
different
argument
that
they
argue
cannot
fairly
say
that
they
are
absolutely
indistinguishable
because
the
distinction
is
their
place
of
residence
and
that's
what
the
--
that's
the
distinction
made
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn’t
at
issue
in
dandridge,
there
was
an
issue
