what
--
what
is
the
government's
response
to
the
claims
that
the
secretary
really
does
provide
welfare
for
a
lot
of
the
non-reservation
indians?
justice
byron

white
in
oklahoma
and
alaska?
justice
byron

well,
why
are
the
--
why
do
you
provide
welfare
for
non-reservation
indians
in
oklahoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
indians,
i
call
attention
to
another
example,
the
turtle
mountain
reservation
in
north
dakota.
those
indians
can
live
anywhere
they
want
to
and
still
get
the
welfare,
that's
what
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
those
rapid
city
indians
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
but
it
is
said
here
in
the
brief
that
indians
residing
in
rapid
city
south,
dakota
get
to
the
welfare
to
some
extent,
and
they
are
not
even
close
to
a
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
suggesting
that
bureau
doesn’t
give
welfare
to
any
oklahoma
or
alaska
indians
except
those
who
are
living
on
trust
property?
justice
byron
r.
white

think
you
were
then
and
that
you
are
saying
that
you
are
giving
welfare
to
indians
who
are
still
members
of
an
established
tribal
organization?
justice
byron

was
there

is
there
any
other
if
there
are
any
challenge
to
rule
about
the
difference
between
reservations
and
non-reservation
indians
in
this
context
on
any
ground
other
than
the
statutory
ground
that's
just
isn't
consistent
with
the
same?
justice
byron

the

that
there
was
no
other
one
presented
below?

and
that
is
here,
that
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
have
to
reach
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
the
government
say
is
the
purpose
of
that
regulation,
just
to
save
money
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
bia
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
government
deny
that
it
has
an
impact
whether
on
movement?
