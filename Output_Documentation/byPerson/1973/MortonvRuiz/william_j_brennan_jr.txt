what's
the
most
of
benefit
when
he
said
"on
or
near"
that
seems
to
be
his
definition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

these
are
“"on

near"
reservations”
and
i
thought
a
lot
a
modern
service
bureau,
serving
as
many
as
400,000
indians
in
alaska,
natives
who
live
"on
or
near"
reservations,
people
will
find
themselves
isolated
from
the
mainstream
of
the
american
lives?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
these
are
--
these
particular
indians
in
this
case
are
near,
aren't
they?

they
make
a

it's
definitely.
do
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
as
having
adopted
the
“on
or
near”
limitation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
had
reference
to
it
--
this
is
rather
board
language
in
the
opinion
on
page
21
of
the
petition.
it
said
in
light
of
it
before
going,
we
conclude
that
congress
intended
general
assistance
benefits
to
be
available
to
all
indians,
including
those
in
the
position
of
appellates
at
the
time
that
snyder
act
is
passed.
that
seems
rather
boarder
than
an
“on
or
near”
limitation,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
are
not
defending
that
though

justice
william

brennan,

well,
suppose
he
was
papago?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
argument
i
gather
mr.
woods
is
directed
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
in
terms
of
the
location
of
these
two
indian
groups,
not
to
some
general
proposition
that
somewhere
in
another
states,
off
reservation
indians
are
given
general
assistance
benefits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
am
addressing
of
course
to
your
constitutional
argument?
justice
william
j.

which
have
also
i
think
just
suggested
that
