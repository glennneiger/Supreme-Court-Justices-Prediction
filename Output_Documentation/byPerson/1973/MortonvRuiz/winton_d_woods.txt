mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
my
name
is
winton
woods,
counsel
for
the
respondents
in
this
case.
i
would,
at
the
outset,
like
to
clear
up
what
seem
to
me
yesterday
to
be
apparent
misunderstanding
about
our
basic
position
in
this
case.
first
i
think
we
need
to
be
very
clear
about
what
it
is
that
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
general
assistance
sponsored
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
it
is
in
fact
a
supplemental
program
that
is
available
only
to
needy
indians
who
do
not
qualify
for
one
of
the
categorical
programs
under
the
social
security
act.
those
programs
are
generally
run
by
the
states.
the
ga
program
is
run
by
the
bia
for
the
benefit
of
indians
who
congress
has
determined
by
virtue
of
their
very
special
status
in
american
life,
are
worthy
of
some
special
consideration.
with
that
in
mind
i
think,
we
are
talking
in
this
case
not
about
discrimination
between
indians
and
non-indians,
but
about
discrimination
between
differing
groups
of
indians,
between
those
indians
who
do
receive
the
bia
general
assistance
and
those
who
do
not
receive
bia
general
assistance.
now,
the
government
has
sought
to
characterize
the
holding
of
the
court
below
in
the
very
broadest
possible
manner.
in
fact,
we
think
that
the
holding
of
the
court
was
quite
narrow.
if
i
might
quote,
the
court
of
appeals
held,
we
hold
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
was
improper
for
the
bureau
to
deny
general
assistance
on
the
basis
of
residency
alone.
now
there
are
two
elements
to
that
holding
that
i
think
need
to
be
noted
if
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
is
to
be
properly
understood.
first,
the
special
circumstances
that
exist
in
this
case
and
secondly,
the
very
narrow
automatic
basis
of
the
administrative
decision
to
deny
welfare.
the
respondents
here,
plaintiffs
below,
are
full-blooded
papago
indians
who
are
members
their
tribe.
they
are
un-assimilated.
they
speak
primarily
the
papago
language.
they
reside
in
a
papago
community,
15
miles
from
their
reservation.
they
are
in
every
respect
as
the
stucki
affidavit
which
is
in
the
appendix
of
pages
84
and
87
demonstrate,
papago
indians.
moreover,
they
reside
within
the
historic
boundaries
of
their
aboriginal
land,
land
that
the
indian
claims
commission
has
recently
found
was
illegally
taken
from
them.
and
finally,
there
is
no
question
on
the
record
after
the
fair
hearing
in
this
case,
that
they
are
needy
indians
within
the
intent
of
the
congressional
legislation
that's
at
issue
here.
against
that
factual
background,
then
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
automatically
determined
that
the
respondents
were
not
entitled
to
general
assistance,
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
of
their
residency,
15
miles
from
the
reservation
boundary.
the
result
of
that
interpretation
which
in
fact
is
not
unusual
is
severe
discrimination.
first,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
yesterday,
a
papago
miner
who
happened
to
live
on
the
western
edge
of
the
reservation
and
thus
was
able
to
commute
to
the
mines
at
ajo
would
be
entitled
to
general
assistance
if
he
needed
it,
while
persons
in
the
situation
of
the
ruizs,
who
come
from
south
komelik
in
the
far
southern
part
of
the
reservation,
near
the
mexican
border,
and
thus
who
are
unable
to
commute
are
forced
to
move
into
indian
village
in
ajo
in
order
to
work
if
they
are
to
find
work.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
very
little
work
available
on
the
papago
reservation.
what
can
be
found,
generally
has
found
in
the
bordering
communities.
secondly,
and
the
court
has
discussed
this
at
some
length
with
mr.
sachse,
there
are
some
non-reservation
indians
who
receive
general
assistance
benefits,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
they
do
not
reside
on
the
reservation,
and
we
think
that
they
are
indistinguishable
from
the
respondents
in
this
case.
the
government
has
suggested
that
there
is
some
difference
based
upon
the
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation,
and
yet
the
government
has
admitted
in
their
brief
and
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
that
jurisdiction
exists
in
this
case,
that
the
bureau
in
fact
has
jurisdiction
to
extent
benefits
to
these
people.
i
think
that
we
cannot
assume
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
that
exists
in
this
case
that
congress
intended
that
these
strange
and
unusual
results
would
come
about
when
they
approved
this
program.
we
believe
that
the
results
violate
congressional
intent
and
that
they
also
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
our
basic
case
then
is
this.
we
believe
that
when
congress
directed
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
through
the
snyder
act
to
expend
such
moneys
as
they
would
appropriate
in
the
future
for
the
care
and
benefit
of
the
indians
throughout
the
united
states,
and
when
they
later
in
1968,
which
is
the
act
in
issue
in
this
case,
appropriated
money
pursuant
to
that
mandate,
that
the
plain
language
of
those
statutes
does
not
allow
the
automatic
or
conclusive
presumption,
if
you
will,
of
non-eligibility
that
is
based
solely
upon
the
place
of
residence.
now
that's
not
to
say
that
we
believe
that
the
statute
mandates
the
payment
of
general
assistance
benefits
to
indians
throughout
the
united
states,
no
matter
where
they
may
be
found,
no
matter
what
their
percentage
of
blood
may
be,
no
matter
what
their
degree
of
assimilation
may
be.
we
believe
that
the
secretary
can
and
should
protrude
--
pursuant
to
the
congressional
mandate,
create
a
carefully
drawn
regulation
that
draws
the
very
line
of
mr.
sachse
was
talking
about,
and
that
line
can
be
drawn
by
focusing
upon
the
worthy
indian
both
in
the
snyder
act
and
in
the
appropriations
act.
a
statute
that
defines
or
a
regulation
that
defines
who
is
an
indian,
for
purposes
of
those
statutes
might
very
well
meet
every
conceivable
objection
that
the
government
has
to
our
case.
for
example,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
might
conclude
that
an
indian
--
well,
that
in
defining
an
indian,
that
they
would
look
to
things
such
as
the
degree
of
assimilation
into
the
dominant
culture,
that
they
would
look
to
such
things
as
degree
of
blood.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
i
agree,
and
they
are
also
the
range
of
factors
that
have
been
adopted
by
the
public
health
service
to
determine
their
jurisdiction.
if
i
might
speak
to
the
point
more
directly.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
case
is
quite
distinguishable
from
the
dandridge
case.
the
government
consistently
has
suggested,
that
this
is
a
dandridge
problem.
i
read
dandridge,
at
least
to
say
that
this
court
will
not
second-guess
legislative
judgments,
a
relative
need
between
competing
classes
of
welfare
recipients.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
this
case.
if
we
are
to
analogize
this
case
to
dandridge
versus
williams
or
jefferson
versus
hackney,
i
think
we
could
hypothesize
a
situation,
in
which
the
state
of
maryland
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
state,
chose
to
extend
afdc
benefits
only
to
mothers
who
live
in
baltimore
county.
as
you
well
remember
from
the
facts
that
case,
there
was
a
discrimination
in
dandridge
between
baltimore
county
and
the
rest
of
the
state
and
to
the
extent
that
families
in
baltimore
county
received
slightly
more
money.
i
suspect
that
this
case
--
that
this
court,
apart
from
the
social
security
act
issue,
on
constitutional
grounds
would
have
seen
that
case
quite
differently
had
maryland
said,
we
are
only
going
to
expend
money
for
mothers
in
baltimore
county,
without
any
factual
showing,
without
any
determination
that
that
was
a
rational
choice.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that's
perfectly
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
believe
that
the
case
can
be
decided
on
narrow,
statutory
grounds
on
the
basis
of
the
obviously
unclear
legislative
history,
the
somewhat
unclear
language
of
the
two
statutes
and
by
application
of
the
standard
of
construction,
that
this
court
has
applied
since
the
time
with
mr.
chief
justice
marshall,
and
has
most
recently
applied
last
year
in
the
mcclanahan
case.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
it
does
and
it
doesn’t.
as
a
general
proposition,
it's
quite
clear
that
it
does,
and
if
this
where
an
ordinary
case,
i
would
not
be
standing
here,
making
the
arguments
that
i
am.
the
fact
is
that,
the
government
over
the
course
of
years
has
told
the
congress
that
it
is
expending
money
for
the
benefit
of
indians
who
live
“on
or
near”
reservations.
now,
there
have
been
times,
when
various
senators,
particularly
senator
bible
in
a
colloquy
this
court
at
length
and
the
court
of
appeals
spending
attempted
to
find
out,
just
exactly
what
the
bureau
meant
when
it
said
“on
or
near.”
the
bureau
has
never
adequately
described
to
congress,
what
the
“on
or
near”
language
meant.
more
over,
they
suggested
the
existence
of
this
regulation
should
under
the
standard
rule
be
taken
to
be
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
as
congress
has
not
overridden
it
in
anyway
through
the
statue.
i
would
agree
again
with
that
as
a
general
proposition,
but
the
fact
of
this
case
is,
that
pursuant
to
the
policies
established
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
manual
itself,
that
regulation
is
not
for
public
consumption.
it
is
a
regulation
designed
for
internal
administration.
those
regulations
that
are
designed
to
inform
the
public
and
presumably
the
congress,
are
not
contained
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
manual
alone,
but
they
are
put
in
cfr,
and
through
the
federal
register.
this
regulation
is
hidden
away
in
a
manual
that
is
used
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
handling
its
internal
programs,
and
we
simply
don't
believe
that
the
standard,
and
i
believe
appropriate
rule
in
regard
to
long-standing
administrative
regulations
is
applicable
in
this
case.
secondly,
the
government
points
to
the
fact,
that
the
appropriations
request
itself
has
always
contained
the
limitation.
we
would
suggest
that
the
fact
that
congress
chose
not
to
include
the
requested
limitation
in
its
appropriation
is
equal
in
argument
for
our
side.
we
might
well
assume,
particularly
following
the
squire
versus
capoeman
standard
of
liberal
construction
for
statute
regarding
indian
affairs,
we
might
very
well
assume
that
the
failure
of
congress
to
enact
a
regulation
requested
by
the
bureau,
is
in
fact
a
recognition
of
congress'
intent
to
not
limit
the
program
to
the
degree
that
the
bureau
sought
to
do
so.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
indeed
it
does,
your
honor,
and
again
i
believe
that
the
actual
application
of
that
provision,
i
assume
that
you
are
talking
about
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs'
manual
regulations.
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
we
think
that
there
is
substantial
support
for
that
finding
that
over
the
course
of
years,
the
bureau
has
administered
their
program
in
a
very
sloppy
way.
that
they
have
in
fact
extended
benefits
to
indians
who
do
not
reside
on
reservations
even
outside
of
alaska
and
oklahoma.
it
has
never
been
quite
clear
even
in
the
legislative
history
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
just
how
far
the
bureau
has
gone
to
extend
benefits
to
near
reservations
indians.
the
court
of
appeals
found,
however,
and
we
think
found
correctly
that
they
have
done
so.
so
that
the
in
fact
practice
over
the
course
of
years
differs
greatly
from
the
specific
language
of
the
regulation
and
we
believe
that
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
not
to
look
only
or
to
look
not
only
at
the
specific
language
of
the
regulation,
but
to
look
at
--
look
as
well
to
the
practice
of
the
bureau
under
that
regulation.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
precisely
the
suggestion
that
i
am
offering
to
this
court,
it
is
the
suggestion
that
i
offered
to
them
and
that
is
that
it's
not
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
of
the
district
court
or
of
this
court
to
draft
the
regulation
for
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
we
have
asked
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
directing
them
to
draft
a
regulation
in
light
of
their
experience
and
knowledge.
they
are
the
agency
supposedly
with
the
expertise
in
the
area.
we
suggest
that
they
be
directed
to
draft
a
regulation
that
incorporates
functional
standards
describing
who
is
an
indian
to
avoid
the
discriminations
which
we
see
in
the
program
as
is
presently
right.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
it
is
your
honor.
it's
clearly
broader
and
the
question
is
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
well
let
me
say
this.
i
would
defend
that
with
the
understanding
that
the
word
indian
is
subject
to
limiting
construction.
i
would
not
assert
that
the
bureau
must
pay
general
assistance
benefits
to
a
manhattan
stock
broker
who
happens
to
be
164th
papago.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
i
say
the
outset
(voice
overlap)
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
i
can
make
a
few
suggestions
i
would
not
purport
to
stand
in
front
of
this
court
and
draft
a
regulation
without
any
real
expertise
in
the
area
of
indian
affairs.
i
would
suggest
in
regard
to
that
specific
question
that
the
bureau
of
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
depending
on
how
you
define
indian,
your
honor.
you
might
define
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
i
think
he
is
clearly
a
fully
assimilated
indian
and
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
indian
that
we
think
congress
did
not
intend
to
(voice
overlap)
i
do
not
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
this
is
a
very
difficult
point
and
it
has
bothered,
it
bothered
to
judge
wolf
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
they
are
all
indians
and
all
them
--
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
snyder
act
and
the
appropriations
act
that
the
bureau
may
adopt
a
narrower
definition
of
the
indian.
it
may
say
that
indian
for
this
purpose
means
and
an
assimilated
indian
of
certain
degree
of
blood
who
and
indeed
residence
maybe
a
relevant
consideration.
we
don't
--
we
don't
deny
that
residence
is
one
factor
that
the
bureau
may
consider
in
using
mr.
justice
marshall's
hypothetical,
the
indian
who
resides
in
new
york
might
because
of
one
of
that
fact
and
some
other
facts
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
not
be
an
indian
for
the
purposes
of
the
program,
not
for
all
purposes,
but
simply
for
the
purposes
of
the
program
that
congress
has
created
through
the
snyder
act
and
the
appropriations
act.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
this
was
originally
an
action
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
district
court.
it
was
the
--
the
complaint
was
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
a
judgment
was
entered
for
the
defendants.
case
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
court
of
appeals
found
in
favor
respondents
and
government
appealed
to
this
court.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
it
was
an
action
of
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
pursuant
to
1361
as
well
as
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
we
believe
that
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
position,
regarding
the
legislative
history
that
there
are
then
three
constitutional
issues
that
it
must
confront.
two
of
those
we
have
dealt
with
to
some
extend
already.
first
is
the
discrimination
between
some
non-reservation
indians
and
other
non-reservation
indians.
the
government
has
gone
to
great
lengths
to
attempt
to
find
a
rational
basis
for
that
discrimination.
but
we
simply
say
that
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
that's
evident
in
the
record.
perhaps
more
importantly,
however,
there
is
a
discrimination
between
reservation
indians
and
non-reservation
indians.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
affidavit
of
mr.
elly
sam
which
is
in
the
appendix
at
pages
89
and
90
and
was
part,
an
exhibit
in
support
of
our
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
sam
is
vice
chairman
of
papago
tribe
and
he
described
the
situation
that
occurred
when
the
government
came
in
and
built
a
dam
in
the
northern
part
of
the
reservation,
called
painted
rock
dam.
a
village
that
was
on
the
dam
location,
the
dam
site,
had
to
be
removed.
the
government
built
a
new
village
in
the
town
of
hillaback
which
is
directly
adjacent
to
the
reservation.
they
purchased
the
land
and
treated
it
as
if
they
were
on
the
reservation.
however,
some
19
families
who
had
lived
on
the
land
where
the
old
village
was
were
not
included
in
the
new
community
that
was
build
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
they
had
to
go
some
place
and
by
the
nature
of
the
papago
community,
they
did
not
feel
free
to
move
to
far
parts
of
the
reservation.
they
wanted
to
maintain
their
kingship
ties
with
their
village
and
so
they
moved
then
to
hillaback.
the
situation
now
as
described
by
vice
chairman
sam
is
that
those
19
families
are
denied
general
assistance
benefits,
even
though
they
reside
perhaps
a
few
feet
from
the
reservation
boundary
and
they
reside
there
by
virtue
of
the
action
of
the
government.
while
other
indians
who
have
been
moved
into
the
new
community
built
by
the
bia
are
given
general
assistance
and
new
houses
and
all
of
the
other
things
that
the
government
can
do
for
the
indians.
we
suggest
that
discriminations
of
that
kind,
discrimination
such
as
the
one
suggested
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
yesterday
between
the
miner
who
lives
on
the
western
edge
of
the
reservation
and
commutes
to
ajo
some
12
miles
or
and
the
indians
who
lives
in
the
indian
village
that
those
discriminations
between
certain
kinds
of
reservation
indians
and
certain
kinds
of
non-reservation
indians
are
simply
indefensible.
we
can
find
no
rational
basis
to
support
that
classification.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
it
is
directed
to
the
both
points.
i
am
talking
now
about
the
precise
facts
of
this
case
because
i
understand
them
more
clearly.
the
other
situations
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
come
from
statements
of
bureau
of
indian
affairs
officials
to
various
appropriations
committees
and
congress
over
the
course
of
years
and
they
have
describe,
this
rather
is
a
fuzzy
way
in
which
they
about
administering
their
program.
i
can't
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
right
and
we
suggest
that
the
discrimination
created
on
the
reservation
in
arizona
as
well
as
those
situations
described
in
the
brief
in
alaska
and
oklahoma,
rapid
city,
turtle
mountain
apparently
in
reno,
we
know
of
there
may
very
well
be
other
situations
which
we
are
unaware.
the
point
is
that
there
are
some
reservation
indians
or
non-reservation
indians
who
are
indistinguishable,
indistinguishable
from
their
brothers
who
reside
a
few
miles
away
on
the
reservation
who
are
denied
general
assistance
benefits
while
the
class
of
people
from
whom
they
cannot
be
distinguished
are
granted
general
assistance
benefits.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that
is
precisely
what
it's
about
your
honor
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that
is
a
distinction,
but
we
would
suggest
that
that
distinction,
there
is
no
rational
relationship
to
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
which
is
to
help
needy
indians,
as
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
finally,
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
traditional
equal
protection
argument
and
the
legislative
history
nonetheless
requiring
to
uphold
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
regulation
an
issue
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
standard
for
judging
the
constitutionality
of
the
action
of
the
bureau
and
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
is
the
strict
scrutiny
test
adopted
by
this
court
in
shapiro
versus
tompkins.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
have
three
grounds
upon
which
we
think
this
is
improper.
we
think
it
violates
the
intend
of
congress.
we
think
it
violates
traditional
equal
protection
and
we
think
it
infringes
upon
the
right
of
an
indian
to
travel
throughout
and
just
don't
like
aboriginal
land.
the
facts
of
this
case
i
would
remind
the
court
are
that
the
land
upon
which
the
respondents
live,
is
land
that
was
illegally
taken
from
the
papago
tribe
as
found
by
the
indian
claims
commission.
they
reside
within
their
historic
aboriginal
land
and
they
have
exercised
their
right
and
i
have
to
admit
that
it
is
not
a
right
that
this
court
has
established,
but
i
think
that
any
fair
reading
of
the
right
to
travel
cases,
must
conclude
that
an
indian
has
a
right
to
travel
particularly
throughout
his
historic
land.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
the
--
in
our
added
statement,
the
statement
made
by
the
government,
there
is
very
little
work
available
on
the
reservation
and
thus
travel
around
the
reservation
and
to
off-reservation
communities
becomes
a
matter
of
necessity
of
one
is
to
work.
if
mr.
ruiz
wanted
to
work
in
the
mines,
he
had
to
move
to
ajo
and
to
live
in
indian
village
since
commuting
from
his
village
in
the
the
southern
part
of
the
reservation
was
impossible.
he
could
have
moved
back,
he
could
have
moved
back
to
the
reservation
as
evidently
many
miners
did,
as
professor
stucki
discovered
during
his
study,
but
he
wanted
to
keep
his
daughter
in
school
in
ajo,
so
that
she
would
have
a
better
chance
than
he
had
and
he
did
so.
thus
he
was
penalized
by
the
bureau
for
having
exercised
the
fundamental
right
by
having
gone
to
ajo
a
few
miles
from
his
reservation
to
find
work.
moreover,
the
regulation
acts
as
an
inducement
for
him
to
come
back
to
the
regulation
and
there
evidently
are
a
number
of
cases
described
not
only
in
the
various
committee
hearings,
but
in
the
affidavits
in
this
case,
in
which
indians
have
returned
to
the
reservation.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
you
mean
if
they
had
moved
out
of
maryland
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
--
that
they
have
moved
to
some
other
state.
i
quite
agree
and
i
think
again
this
is
a
different
case.
we
are
not
suggesting
and
the
government
is
not
suggesting
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs'
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
a
single
state.
they
have
traveled
throughout
the
area
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
governmental
agency
that
creates
the
welfare
program
i.e.
the
united
states
government.
we
think
that
that
is
a
distinguishable
case
from
the
person
who
moves
say
from
maryland
to
virginia
and
then
seeks
benefits
from
the
state
of
maryland
because
they
are
higher
than
virginia.
we
wouldn't
argue
for
that
proposition.
we
argue
only
for
the
proposition
that
a
person
who
travels
within
the
appropriate
governmental
jurisdiction
has
got
a
right
to
not
be
discriminated
against
because
they
have
exercised
that
right
of
movement.
i
understand
that
perhaps
later
today,
and
at
least
by
tomorrow,
another
arizona
case
dealing
with
right
to
some
extent,
to
the
right
intrastate
travel
will
be
before
this
court
and
i
think
to
some
extent
that
is
relevant
to
the
right
to
travel
argument
that
we
are
raising
here.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
no,
we
don't
suggest
that
it
is
any
different
from
the
right
of
an
ordinary
citizen.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
simply
because
the
question
raised
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
creates
the
situation
in
which
a
welfare
recipient
moves
from
one
jurisdiction,
one
relevant
governmental
jurisdiction
into
another
from
jurisdiction
a
which
was
previously
paying
welfare
assistance
to
her
to
jurisdiction
b.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
you
did
sustain,
i
think
without
a
great
deal
of
discussion
the
differential
between
baltimore
county
and
the
rest
of
the
state
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
i
take
it,
it
was
not
an
issue
and
moreover
this
is
not
the
dandridge
case.
there
isn't
a
differential
here.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
has
weighed
competing
needs
among
classes
of
people.
it
is
a
case
where
the
bureau
automatically
without
any
factual
basis
has
concluded
that
off-reservations
indians
were
not
within
the
recipient
population
created
by
congress
i.e.
needy
un-assimilated
indians.
and
we
think
that's
very
different
from
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
quite
properly
i
believe
upholding
the
right
of
a
state
legislature
to
make
judgments
about
competing
needs
among
competing
classes
of
recipients.
we
think
it's
a
quite
different
matter
to
say
that
these
people
are
not
to
be
included
at
all.
they
are
not
even
to
be
given
a
shot
at
dividing
up
that
limited
pie.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
my
name
is
winton
woods,
counsel
for
the
respondents
in
this
case.
i
would,
at
the
outset,
like
to
clear
up
what
seem
to
me
yesterday
to
be
apparent
misunderstanding
about
our
basic
position
in
this
case.
first
i
think
we
need
to
be
very
clear
about
what
it
is
that
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
general
assistance
sponsored
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
it
is
in
fact
a
supplemental
program
that
is
available
only
to
needy
indians
who
do
not
qualify
for
one
of
the
categorical
programs
under
the
social
security
act.
those
programs
are
generally
run
by
the
states.
the
ga
program
is
run
by
the
bia
for
the
benefit
of
indians
who
congress
has
determined
by
virtue
of
their
very
special
status
in
american
life,
are
worthy
of
some
special
consideration.
with
that
in
mind
i
think,
we
are
talking
in
this
case
not
about
discrimination
between
indians
and
non-indians,
but
about
discrimination
between
differing
groups
of
indians,
between
those
indians
who
do
receive
the
bia
general
assistance
and
those
who
do
not
receive
bia
general
assistance.
now,
the
government
has
sought
to
characterize
the
holding
of
the
court
below
in
the
very
broadest
possible
manner.
in
fact,
we
think
that
the
holding
of
the
court
was
quite
narrow.
if
i
might
quote,
the
court
of
appeals
held,
we
hold
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
was
improper
for
the
bureau
to
deny
general
assistance
on
the
basis
of
residency
alone.
now
there
are
two
elements
to
that
holding
that
i
think
need
to
be
noted
if
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
is
to
be
properly
understood.
first,
the
special
circumstances
that
exist
in
this
case
and
secondly,
the
very
narrow
automatic
basis
of
the
administrative
decision
to
deny
welfare.
the
respondents
here,
plaintiffs
below,
are
full-blooded
papago
indians
who
are
members
their
tribe.
they
are
un-assimilated.
they
speak
primarily
the
papago
language.
they
reside
in
a
papago
community,
15
miles
from
their
reservation.
they
are
in
every
respect
as
the
stucki
affidavit
which
is
in
the
appendix
of
pages
84
and
87
demonstrate,
papago
indians.
moreover,
they
reside
within
the
historic
boundaries
of
their
aboriginal
land,
land
that
the
indian
claims
commission
has
recently
found
was
illegally
taken
from
them.
and
finally,
there
is
no
question
on
the
record
after
the
fair
hearing
in
this
case,
that
they
are
needy
indians
within
the
intent
of
the
congressional
legislation
that's
at
issue
here.
against
that
factual
background,
then
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
automatically
determined
that
the
respondents
were
not
entitled
to
general
assistance,
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
of
their
residency,
15
miles
from
the
reservation
boundary.
the
result
of
that
interpretation
which
in
fact
is
not
unusual
is
severe
discrimination.
first,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
yesterday,
a
papago
miner
who
happened
to
live
on
the
western
edge
of
the
reservation
and
thus
was
able
to
commute
to
the
mines
at
ajo
would
be
entitled
to
general
assistance
if
he
needed
it,
while
persons
in
the
situation
of
the
ruizs,
who
come
from
south
komelik
in
the
far
southern
part
of
the
reservation,
near
the
mexican
border,
and
thus
who
are
unable
to
commute
are
forced
to
move
into
indian
village
in
ajo
in
order
to
work
if
they
are
to
find
work.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
very
little
work
available
on
the
papago
reservation.
what
can
be
found,
generally
has
found
in
the
bordering
communities.
secondly,
and
the
court
has
discussed
this
at
some
length
with
mr.
sachse,
there
are
some
non-reservation
indians
who
receive
general
assistance
benefits,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
they
do
not
reside
on
the
reservation,
and
we
think
that
they
are
indistinguishable
from
the
respondents
in
this
case.
the
government
has
suggested
that
there
is
some
difference
based
upon
the
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation,
and
yet
the
government
has
admitted
in
their
brief
and
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
that
jurisdiction
exists
in
this
case,
that
the
bureau
in
fact
has
jurisdiction
to
extent
benefits
to
these
people.
i
think
that
we
cannot
assume
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
that
exists
in
this
case
that
congress
intended
that
these
strange
and
unusual
results
would
come
about
when
they
approved
this
program.
we
believe
that
the
results
violate
congressional
intent
and
that
they
also
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
our
basic
case
then
is
this.
we
believe
that
when
congress
directed
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
through
the
snyder
act
to
expend
such
moneys
as
they
would
appropriate
in
the
future
for
the
care
and
benefit
of
the
indians
throughout
the
united
states,
and
when
they
later
in
1968,
which
is
the
act
in
issue
in
this
case,
appropriated
money
pursuant
to
that
mandate,
that
the
plain
language
of
those
statutes
does
not
allow
the
automatic
or
conclusive
presumption,
if
you
will,
of
non-eligibility
that
is
based
solely
upon
the
place
of
residence.
now
that's
not
to
say
that
we
believe
that
the
statute
mandates
the
payment
of
general
assistance
benefits
to
indians
throughout
the
united
states,
no
matter
where
they
may
be
found,
no
matter
what
their
percentage
of
blood
may
be,
no
matter
what
their
degree
of
assimilation
may
be.
we
believe
that
the
secretary
can
and
should
protrude
--
pursuant
to
the
congressional
mandate,
create
a
carefully
drawn
regulation
that
draws
the
very
line
of
mr.
sachse
was
talking
about,
and
that
line
can
be
drawn
by
focusing
upon
the
worthy
indian
both
in
the
snyder
act
and
in
the
appropriations
act.
a
statute
that
defines
or
a
regulation
that
defines
who
is
an
indian,
for
purposes
of
those
statutes
might
very
well
meet
every
conceivable
objection
that
the
government
has
to
our
case.
for
example,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
might
conclude
that
an
indian
--
well,
that
in
defining
an
indian,
that
they
would
look
to
things
such
as
the
degree
of
assimilation
into
the
dominant
culture,
that
they
would
look
to
such
things
as
degree
of
blood.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
i
agree,
and
they
are
also
the
range
of
factors
that
have
been
adopted
by
the
public
health
service
to
determine
their
jurisdiction.
if
i
might
speak
to
the
point
more
directly.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
case
is
quite
distinguishable
from
the
dandridge
case.
the
government
consistently
has
suggested,
that
this
is
a
dandridge
problem.
i
read
dandridge,
at
least
to
say
that
this
court
will
not
second-guess
legislative
judgments,
a
relative
need
between
competing
classes
of
welfare
recipients.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
this
case.
if
we
are
to
analogize
this
case
to
dandridge
versus
williams
or
jefferson
versus
hackney,
i
think
we
could
hypothesize
a
situation,
in
which
the
state
of
maryland
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
state,
chose
to
extend
afdc
benefits
only
to
mothers
who
live
in
baltimore
county.
as
you
well
remember
from
the
facts
that
case,
there
was
a
discrimination
in
dandridge
between
baltimore
county
and
the
rest
of
the
state
and
to
the
extent
that
families
in
baltimore
county
received
slightly
more
money.
i
suspect
that
this
case
--
that
this
court,
apart
from
the
social
security
act
issue,
on
constitutional
grounds
would
have
seen
that
case
quite
differently
had
maryland
said,
we
are
only
going
to
expend
money
for
mothers
in
baltimore
county,
without
any
factual
showing,
without
any
determination
that
that
was
a
rational
choice.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that's
perfectly
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
believe
that
the
case
can
be
decided
on
narrow,
statutory
grounds
on
the
basis
of
the
obviously
unclear
legislative
history,
the
somewhat
unclear
language
of
the
two
statutes
and
by
application
of
the
standard
of
construction,
that
this
court
has
applied
since
the
time
with
mr.
chief
justice
marshall,
and
has
most
recently
applied
last
year
in
the
mcclanahan
case.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
it
does
and
it
doesn’t.
as
a
general
proposition,
it's
quite
clear
that
it
does,
and
if
this
where
an
ordinary
case,
i
would
not
be
standing
here,
making
the
arguments
that
i
am.
the
fact
is
that,
the
government
over
the
course
of
years
has
told
the
congress
that
it
is
expending
money
for
the
benefit
of
indians
who
live
“on
or
near”
reservations.
now,
there
have
been
times,
when
various
senators,
particularly
senator
bible
in
a
colloquy
this
court
at
length
and
the
court
of
appeals
spending
attempted
to
find
out,
just
exactly
what
the
bureau
meant
when
it
said
“on
or
near.”
the
bureau
has
never
adequately
described
to
congress,
what
the
“on
or
near”
language
meant.
more
over,
they
suggested
the
existence
of
this
regulation
should
under
the
standard
rule
be
taken
to
be
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
as
congress
has
not
overridden
it
in
anyway
through
the
statue.
i
would
agree
again
with
that
as
a
general
proposition,
but
the
fact
of
this
case
is,
that
pursuant
to
the
policies
established
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
manual
itself,
that
regulation
is
not
for
public
consumption.
it
is
a
regulation
designed
for
internal
administration.
those
regulations
that
are
designed
to
inform
the
public
and
presumably
the
congress,
are
not
contained
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
manual
alone,
but
they
are
put
in
cfr,
and
through
the
federal
register.
this
regulation
is
hidden
away
in
a
manual
that
is
used
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
handling
its
internal
programs,
and
we
simply
don't
believe
that
the
standard,
and
i
believe
appropriate
rule
in
regard
to
long-standing
administrative
regulations
is
applicable
in
this
case.
secondly,
the
government
points
to
the
fact,
that
the
appropriations
request
itself
has
always
contained
the
limitation.
we
would
suggest
that
the
fact
that
congress
chose
not
to
include
the
requested
limitation
in
its
appropriation
is
equal
in
argument
for
our
side.
we
might
well
assume,
particularly
following
the
squire
versus
capoeman
standard
of
liberal
construction
for
statute
regarding
indian
affairs,
we
might
very
well
assume
that
the
failure
of
congress
to
enact
a
regulation
requested
by
the
bureau,
is
in
fact
a
recognition
of
congress'
intent
to
not
limit
the
program
to
the
degree
that
the
bureau
sought
to
do
so.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
indeed
it
does,
your
honor,
and
again
i
believe
that
the
actual
application
of
that
provision,
i
assume
that
you
are
talking
about
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs'
manual
regulations.
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
we
think
that
there
is
substantial
support
for
that
finding
that
over
the
course
of
years,
the
bureau
has
administered
their
program
in
a
very
sloppy
way.
that
they
have
in
fact
extended
benefits
to
indians
who
do
not
reside
on
reservations
even
outside
of
alaska
and
oklahoma.
it
has
never
been
quite
clear
even
in
the
legislative
history
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
just
how
far
the
bureau
has
gone
to
extend
benefits
to
near
reservations
indians.
the
court
of
appeals
found,
however,
and
we
think
found
correctly
that
they
have
done
so.
so
that
the
in
fact
practice
over
the
course
of
years
differs
greatly
from
the
specific
language
of
the
regulation
and
we
believe
that
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
not
to
look
only
or
to
look
not
only
at
the
specific
language
of
the
regulation,
but
to
look
at
--
look
as
well
to
the
practice
of
the
bureau
under
that
regulation.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
precisely
the
suggestion
that
i
am
offering
to
this
court,
it
is
the
suggestion
that
i
offered
to
them
and
that
is
that
it's
not
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
of
the
district
court
or
of
this
court
to
draft
the
regulation
for
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
we
have
asked
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
directing
them
to
draft
a
regulation
in
light
of
their
experience
and
knowledge.
they
are
the
agency
supposedly
with
the
expertise
in
the
area.
we
suggest
that
they
be
directed
to
draft
a
regulation
that
incorporates
functional
standards
describing
who
is
an
indian
to
avoid
the
discriminations
which
we
see
in
the
program
as
is
presently
right.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
it
is
your
honor.
it's
clearly
broader
and
the
question
is
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
well
let
me
say
this.
i
would
defend
that
with
the
understanding
that
the
word
indian
is
subject
to
limiting
construction.
i
would
not
assert
that
the
bureau
must
pay
general
assistance
benefits
to
a
manhattan
stock
broker
who
happens
to
be
164th
papago.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
i
say
the
outset
(voice
overlap)
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
i
can
make
a
few
suggestions
i
would
not
purport
to
stand
in
front
of
this
court
and
draft
a
regulation
without
any
real
expertise
in
the
area
of
indian
affairs.
i
would
suggest
in
regard
to
that
specific
question
that
the
bureau
of
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
depending
on
how
you
define
indian,
your
honor.
you
might
define
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
i
think
he
is
clearly
a
fully
assimilated
indian
and
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
indian
that
we
think
congress
did
not
intend
to
(voice
overlap)
i
do
not
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
this
is
a
very
difficult
point
and
it
has
bothered,
it
bothered
to
judge
wolf
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
they
are
all
indians
and
all
them
--
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
snyder
act
and
the
appropriations
act
that
the
bureau
may
adopt
a
narrower
definition
of
the
indian.
it
may
say
that
indian
for
this
purpose
means
and
an
assimilated
indian
of
certain
degree
of
blood
who
and
indeed
residence
maybe
a
relevant
consideration.
we
don't
--
we
don't
deny
that
residence
is
one
factor
that
the
bureau
may
consider
in
using
mr.
justice
marshall's
hypothetical,
the
indian
who
resides
in
new
york
might
because
of
one
of
that
fact
and
some
other
facts
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
not
be
an
indian
for
the
purposes
of
the
program,
not
for
all
purposes,
but
simply
for
the
purposes
of
the
program
that
congress
has
created
through
the
snyder
act
and
the
appropriations
act.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
this
was
originally
an
action
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
district
court.
it
was
the
--
the
complaint
was
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
a
judgment
was
entered
for
the
defendants.
case
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
court
of
appeals
found
in
favor
respondents
and
government
appealed
to
this
court.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
it
was
an
action
of
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
pursuant
to
1361
as
well
as
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
we
believe
that
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
position,
regarding
the
legislative
history
that
there
are
then
three
constitutional
issues
that
it
must
confront.
two
of
those
we
have
dealt
with
to
some
extend
already.
first
is
the
discrimination
between
some
non-reservation
indians
and
other
non-reservation
indians.
the
government
has
gone
to
great
lengths
to
attempt
to
find
a
rational
basis
for
that
discrimination.
but
we
simply
say
that
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
that's
evident
in
the
record.
perhaps
more
importantly,
however,
there
is
a
discrimination
between
reservation
indians
and
non-reservation
indians.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
affidavit
of
mr.
elly
sam
which
is
in
the
appendix
at
pages
89
and
90
and
was
part,
an
exhibit
in
support
of
our
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
sam
is
vice
chairman
of
papago
tribe
and
he
described
the
situation
that
occurred
when
the
government
came
in
and
built
a
dam
in
the
northern
part
of
the
reservation,
called
painted
rock
dam.
a
village
that
was
on
the
dam
location,
the
dam
site,
had
to
be
removed.
the
government
built
a
new
village
in
the
town
of
hillaback
which
is
directly
adjacent
to
the
reservation.
they
purchased
the
land
and
treated
it
as
if
they
were
on
the
reservation.
however,
some
19
families
who
had
lived
on
the
land
where
the
old
village
was
were
not
included
in
the
new
community
that
was
build
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
they
had
to
go
some
place
and
by
the
nature
of
the
papago
community,
they
did
not
feel
free
to
move
to
far
parts
of
the
reservation.
they
wanted
to
maintain
their
kingship
ties
with
their
village
and
so
they
moved
then
to
hillaback.
the
situation
now
as
described
by
vice
chairman
sam
is
that
those
19
families
are
denied
general
assistance
benefits,
even
though
they
reside
perhaps
a
few
feet
from
the
reservation
boundary
and
they
reside
there
by
virtue
of
the
action
of
the
government.
while
other
indians
who
have
been
moved
into
the
new
community
built
by
the
bia
are
given
general
assistance
and
new
houses
and
all
of
the
other
things
that
the
government
can
do
for
the
indians.
we
suggest
that
discriminations
of
that
kind,
discrimination
such
as
the
one
suggested
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
yesterday
between
the
miner
who
lives
on
the
western
edge
of
the
reservation
and
commutes
to
ajo
some
12
miles
or
and
the
indians
who
lives
in
the
indian
village
that
those
discriminations
between
certain
kinds
of
reservation
indians
and
certain
kinds
of
non-reservation
indians
are
simply
indefensible.
we
can
find
no
rational
basis
to
support
that
classification.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
your
honor,
it
is
directed
to
the
both
points.
i
am
talking
now
about
the
precise
facts
of
this
case
because
i
understand
them
more
clearly.
the
other
situations
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
come
from
statements
of
bureau
of
indian
affairs
officials
to
various
appropriations
committees
and
congress
over
the
course
of
years
and
they
have
describe,
this
rather
is
a
fuzzy
way
in
which
they
about
administering
their
program.
i
can't
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
right
and
we
suggest
that
the
discrimination
created
on
the
reservation
in
arizona
as
well
as
those
situations
described
in
the
brief
in
alaska
and
oklahoma,
rapid
city,
turtle
mountain
apparently
in
reno,
we
know
of
there
may
very
well
be
other
situations
which
we
are
unaware.
the
point
is
that
there
are
some
reservation
indians
or
non-reservation
indians
who
are
indistinguishable,
indistinguishable
from
their
brothers
who
reside
a
few
miles
away
on
the
reservation
who
are
denied
general
assistance
benefits
while
the
class
of
people
from
whom
they
cannot
be
distinguished
are
granted
general
assistance
benefits.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that
is
precisely
what
it's
about
your
honor
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that
is
a
distinction,
but
we
would
suggest
that
that
distinction,
there
is
no
rational
relationship
to
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
which
is
to
help
needy
indians,
as
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
finally,
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
traditional
equal
protection
argument
and
the
legislative
history
nonetheless
requiring
to
uphold
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
regulation
an
issue
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
appropriate
standard
for
judging
the
constitutionality
of
the
action
of
the
bureau
and
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
is
the
strict
scrutiny
test
adopted
by
this
court
in
shapiro
versus
tompkins.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
have
three
grounds
upon
which
we
think
this
is
improper.
we
think
it
violates
the
intend
of
congress.
we
think
it
violates
traditional
equal
protection
and
we
think
it
infringes
upon
the
right
of
an
indian
to
travel
throughout
and
just
don't
like
aboriginal
land.
the
facts
of
this
case
i
would
remind
the
court
are
that
the
land
upon
which
the
respondents
live,
is
land
that
was
illegally
taken
from
the
papago
tribe
as
found
by
the
indian
claims
commission.
they
reside
within
their
historic
aboriginal
land
and
they
have
exercised
their
right
and
i
have
to
admit
that
it
is
not
a
right
that
this
court
has
established,
but
i
think
that
any
fair
reading
of
the
right
to
travel
cases,
must
conclude
that
an
indian
has
a
right
to
travel
particularly
throughout
his
historic
land.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
the
--
in
our
added
statement,
the
statement
made
by
the
government,
there
is
very
little
work
available
on
the
reservation
and
thus
travel
around
the
reservation
and
to
off-reservation
communities
becomes
a
matter
of
necessity
of
one
is
to
work.
if
mr.
ruiz
wanted
to
work
in
the
mines,
he
had
to
move
to
ajo
and
to
live
in
indian
village
since
commuting
from
his
village
in
the
the
southern
part
of
the
reservation
was
impossible.
he
could
have
moved
back,
he
could
have
moved
back
to
the
reservation
as
evidently
many
miners
did,
as
professor
stucki
discovered
during
his
study,
but
he
wanted
to
keep
his
daughter
in
school
in
ajo,
so
that
she
would
have
a
better
chance
than
he
had
and
he
did
so.
thus
he
was
penalized
by
the
bureau
for
having
exercised
the
fundamental
right
by
having
gone
to
ajo
a
few
miles
from
his
reservation
to
find
work.
moreover,
the
regulation
acts
as
an
inducement
for
him
to
come
back
to
the
regulation
and
there
evidently
are
a
number
of
cases
described
not
only
in
the
various
committee
hearings,
but
in
the
affidavits
in
this
case,
in
which
indians
have
returned
to
the
reservation.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
you
mean
if
they
had
moved
out
of
maryland
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
--
that
they
have
moved
to
some
other
state.
i
quite
agree
and
i
think
again
this
is
a
different
case.
we
are
not
suggesting
and
the
government
is
not
suggesting
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs'
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
a
single
state.
they
have
traveled
throughout
the
area
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
governmental
agency
that
creates
the
welfare
program
i.e.
the
united
states
government.
we
think
that
that
is
a
distinguishable
case
from
the
person
who
moves
say
from
maryland
to
virginia
and
then
seeks
benefits
from
the
state
of
maryland
because
they
are
higher
than
virginia.
we
wouldn't
argue
for
that
proposition.
we
argue
only
for
the
proposition
that
a
person
who
travels
within
the
appropriate
governmental
jurisdiction
has
got
a
right
to
not
be
discriminated
against
because
they
have
exercised
that
right
of
movement.
i
understand
that
perhaps
later
today,
and
at
least
by
tomorrow,
another
arizona
case
dealing
with
right
to
some
extent,
to
the
right
intrastate
travel
will
be
before
this
court
and
i
think
to
some
extent
that
is
relevant
to
the
right
to
travel
argument
that
we
are
raising
here.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
no,
we
don't
suggest
that
it
is
any
different
from
the
right
of
an
ordinary
citizen.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
simply
because
the
question
raised
by
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
creates
the
situation
in
which
a
welfare
recipient
moves
from
one
jurisdiction,
one
relevant
governmental
jurisdiction
into
another
from
jurisdiction
a
which
was
previously
paying
welfare
assistance
to
her
to
jurisdiction
b.
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
you
did
sustain,
i
think
without
a
great
deal
of
discussion
the
differential
between
baltimore
county
and
the
rest
of
the
state
--
mr.
winton
d.
woods,
jr.
i
take
it,
it
was
not
an
issue
and
moreover
this
is
not
the
dandridge
case.
there
isn't
a
differential
here.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
has
weighed
competing
needs
among
classes
of
people.
it
is
a
case
where
the
bureau
automatically
without
any
factual
basis
has
concluded
that
off-reservations
indians
were
not
within
the
recipient
population
created
by
congress
i.e.
needy
un-assimilated
indians.
and
we
think
that's
very
different
from
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
quite
properly
i
believe
upholding
the
right
of
a
state
legislature
to
make
judgments
about
competing
needs
among
competing
classes
of
recipients.
we
think
it's
a
quite
different
matter
to
say
that
these
people
are
not
to
be
included
at
all.
they
are
not
even
to
be
given
a
shot
at
dividing
up
that
limited
pie.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
