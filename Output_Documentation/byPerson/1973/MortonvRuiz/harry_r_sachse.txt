mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
held
essentially
that
a
supplemental
welfare
benefit
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
provides
for
indians
who
live
on
reservations
and
indians
who
live
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
oklahoma
and
alaska
must
be
applied,
must
be
made
available
for
indians
throughout
the
country.
the
court
did
that
not
on
constitutional
ground
but
as
an
interpretation
of
the
statutes
under
which
the
program
is
conducted.
we
think
that
that’s
a
misinterpretation
of
those
statutes
and
then
it
would
require
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
conduct
a
program
that
congress
has
not
appropriated
money
for.
and
it’s
on
that
basis
that
we
ask
the
court
to
review
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
i’d
like
to
take
a
minute
to
describe
what
the
program
is
that
we’re
talking
about.
through
the
social
security
act,
there
are
four
or
five,
i
think
its
four
types
of
categorical
welfare
assistance,
aid
for
dependent
children,
aid
for
the
blind,
and
so
forth
that
under
federal
sponsorship
available
throughout
the
country
through
the
states.
there's
another
which
is
under
a
different
legislation,
the
unemployment
insurance
program.
but
what’s
missing
from
this
program
that
is
available
throughout
the
united
states
is
anything
in
the
way
of
a
general
assistance
program
that
will
give
money
to
able-bodied
people
who
are
chronically
out
of
work.
now
this
is
the
issue
that
the
country
has
faced
in
terms
or
perhaps
has
failed
to
face
in
terms
of
a
negative
income
tax
or
some
sort
of
income
maintenance
program.
because
this
is
missing
from
the
federal
legislation,
the
states
have
done
with
it
pretty
much
as
it
please.
and
some
states
have
fairly
important
income
assistance
programs,
others
do
not.
some
states
do
it
on
a
statewide
basis.
others
do
it
county
by
county.
but
the
situation
became
clear
that
in
the
--
in
indian
reservation
where
the
indian
tribe
itself
has
the
basic
government
and
where
that
government
is
under
the
direct
supervision
of
the
federal
government.
that
the
federal
government
ought
to
undertake
this
kind
of
income
maintenance
program
and
it
did
undertake
this
kind
of
program
in
a
cash
payment
program
rather
than
giving
provisions
which
had
been
done
earlier
in
the
early
1950s
and
this
is
the
program
that
we’re
talking
about,
a
program
that
has
some
flaws
in
it
that
has
worked
fairly
well.
some
people
think,
other
people
think
that
it
tends
to
discourage
people
from
going
out
and
getting
jobs
but
this
is
the
program
and
the
questions
whether
indians
who
are
off
reservations
have
a
right
to
this
program
under
the
legislation.
and
eventually,
i
suppose
the
question
is
whether
it's
constitutional
to
make
this
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
residence
on
a
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
as
we
read
the
opinion
that
since
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
provides
this
supplemental
welfare
program
for
indians
on
reservations.
it
must
provide
it
for
indians
everywhere
or
at
least
in
a
narrow
screening
decision
is
that
it
must
provide
it
for
indians
in
this
situation
of
mr.
ruiz.
that
would
mean
mr.
ruiz
would
get
these
benefits
whereas
the
other
strikers
would
not.
i’d
like
to
take
a
minute
just
to
state
what
you’ve
already
alluded
to
and
that
is
the
situation
mr.
ruiz
here,
mr.
and
mrs.
ruiz.
mr.
and
mrs.
ruiz
are
papago
indians.
as
far
as
i
know,
full
blood.
they
lived
on
the
papago
reservation
until
1939
or
1940.
that
time,
mr.
ruiz
moved
16
miles
away
to
a
town
called
ajo.
he
moved
there
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
ajo.
thank
you.
he
moved
there,
he
got
a
job
in
the
copper
mines
and
he
apparently
worked
steadily
in
those
copper
mines
until
1967,
at
which
time
the
plant
went
out
on
strike.
nobody
under
arizona
law,
none
of
the
striking
workers
were
entitled
to
general
assistance
or
unemployment
compensation
payments.
mr.
ruiz
unable
to
get
the
arizona
payments
applied
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
see
whether
he
could
get
payments
there
and
he
was
denied
those
payments
on
the
basis
that
he
did
not,
neither
he
nor
his
wife
resided
on
the
reservation.
now,
i’d
like
to
discuss
the
statutes
that
under
which
the
bureau
operates
this
program.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
as
i
understand
it,
he
would
have
been
eligible
for
this
program.
he
had
resided
on
the
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct.
be
very
much
as
if
you
have
people
who
live
in
the
state
of
new
york
who
go
to
work
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
the
person
who
still
lives
in
new
york
will
get
whatever
benefits
the
state
of
new
york
offers
i
supposed
and
people
who
moved
from
the
state
of
new
york
and
moved
in
to
new
jersey
then
are
under
--
get
whatever
benefits
new
jersey
supplies
rather
than
new
york.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
your
honor,
he
is.
the
law
as
we
understand
it
has
every
court
that’s
ruled
on
it
so
far
has
held
that
an
indian
is
a
full-fledged
citizen
of
the
united
states
whether
he
lives
on
or
off
a
reservation
and
whatever
welfare
program
that
federal
government
offers
or
that
the
state
offers
--
statewide
would
have
to
be
available
on
reservations
as
well
as
off
reservations
and
this
program
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
i
think
they
--
that
they
agree
with
that
although
i
have
to
ask
them
that
but
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
i
think
it’s
for
that
reason
this
case
is
here.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
on
the
money,
i
would
assume
that
mr.
ruiz
pays
normal
federal
income
tax.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
so.
i
should
ask.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
strike
lasted
about
11
months
and
it’s
over.
on
the
statutory
base,
i
want
to
say
first
that
the
president,
sec
--
through
delegation,
secretary
of
interior
and
director
of
bureau
of
indian
affairs
have
very
broad
authority
under
25
u.s.c.
2
and
25
u.s.c.
9
to
make
such
rules
and
regulations
and
decisions
as
are
necessary
in
this
area.
but
the
act
that
we’re
primarily
concerned
with
here
is
the
snyder
act
which
was
passed
in
1922.
and
i
think
the
act
is
clear
on
its
face.
it’s
the
authorization
act
of
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
provide
health,
education,
welfare
and
all
sorts
of
other
services
to
indians
wherever
they
live
in
the
country.
we
don’t
say
that
this
act
prohibits
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
from
doing
things
for
indians
off
reservations.
but
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
act
simply
is
the
authorization
act
as
it
created
no
programs
and
legislative
history
is
clear
on
this
too
that
to
solve
points
of
order
that
there
was
no
authorization
for
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
congress
passed
this
particular
act.
i
won’t
burden
the
court
with
going
through
what
i’ve
done
in
detail
in
the
brief
there.
the
language
of
it
is
clear.
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
direct,
supervise
and
expend
such
moneys
as
congress
may
from
time
to
time,
appropriate,
for
the
benefit,
care,
and
assistance
of
the
indians
throughout
the
united
states
for
the
following
purposes:
general
support
civilization,
including
education.
at
the
time
this
act
was
passed
there
was
no
general
support
program,
financial
support
program
neither
on
or
off
indian
reservations
or
in
the
country
as
a
whole.
social
legislation
of
1930s
hadn’t
been
passed
at
that
time.
i
thought
it's
a
hard
question.
i
think
that
the
respondents
are
really
reaching
to
take
the
language
in
that
act
and
to
say
that
it
commands
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
institute
a
welfare
program
and
that
that
welfare
program
must
be
for
indians
both
on
and
off
the
reservations.
and
one,
i
would
say
certainly
neutral
observer
of
this
act,
mr.
wolf
who
at
one
point,
i
think
had
some
role
in
representing
the
respondents
in
this
case.
he's
written
a
very
good
law
review
article
on
this
subject
and
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
closed
yesterday,
i
was
about
to
say
that
i
thought
the
snyder
act
when
well
summed
up
by
mr.
wolf
who
at
earlier
stage
was
a
counsel
in
this
case,
which
he
described
the
act
in
law
review
article
this
way.
he
said
the
snyder
act
is
familiar
in
somewhat
distressing
occurrence
in
the
history
of
indian
affairs.
as
in
other
instances,
congress
enacted
a
very
general
measure
and
left
the
rest
up
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
bia.
i
think
that
is
what
the
snyder
act
did
do,
except
i
would
have
one
other
thing.
it
also
left
the
rest
up
to
future
congresses
in
their
appropriations
procedures.
now,
in
all
recent
years
including
the
appropriations
for
fiscal
year
1968,
which
are
at
issue
here,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
submitted
to
the
congress
request
for
funds
or
welfare
program
for
indians
in
this
language.
general
assistance
will
be
provided
to
needy
indians
on
reservations
who
are
not
eligible
for
public
assistance
under
the
social
security
act.
each
year
congress
has
published
that
language
in
its
reports
in
favor
of
the
bill.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
there
are
two
problems
there.
one
is
oklahoma
and
alaska.
i
think
it
is
just
simply
correct
that
this
statement
that
has
been
made
to
the
congress
is
a
compact
and
too
abbreviated
statement.
it
refer
to
be
absolutely
accurate.
it
should
say
for
indians
on
reservations
and
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
oklahoma
and
alaska.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
in
oklahoma
the
reason
is
following.
that
the
whole
section
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
was
once
indian
territory
and
was
totally
occupied
with
indian
reservations.
well,
the
second
part
of
this
what
i
am
getting
at.
the
reservations
have
been
abolished.
the
tribal
organizations
have
not
been
abolished.
the
indians
there
live
on
trust
property
and
with
a
good
deal
of
property
still
managed
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
such
as
in
the
mason
case
that
we
had
last
year
and
the
bureau's
interpretation
of
that
has
been
that
the
lands
that
it
administers
in
oklahoma
are
equivalent
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
has
also
made
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
where
there
indians
living
on
trust
land
that's
administered
by
the
agency
near
a
reservation,
they
simply
treat
that
as
if
it
were
on
the
reservation.
in
other
words,
they
haven't
been
as
rigid
in
saying
that
if
your
off
reservation,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
as
one
might
hope
for
a
mechanical
application
of
the
law.
what
they
have
said
is
in
the
turtle
mountain
incidence
--
they've
simply
equated
administratively
people
living
on
trust
land,
allotted
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
think
that's
trust
land
and
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
am
not
aware
of
them
getting
welfare
under
this
program
and
i
should
mention
that
there
is
another
program
that
does
quite
openly
and
under
congressional
authorization
provide
welfare
for
off-reservation
indians,
that
is
what
is
generally
called
the
relocation
program.
if
an
indian
lives
on
a
reservation
or
near
a
reservation,
and
he
cannot
get
a
job
and
he
wants
to
go
somewhere
else
to
look
for
a
job,
the
bureau
will
try
to
find
him
a
job
and
will
provide
him
general
assistance
for
several
years
when
he
first
begins
to
work.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
i
don't
want
to
go
that
far.
i
think
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
think
that,
that's
the
distinction
either
because
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
mr.
ruiz
is
not
a
member
of
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
tribal
organization.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
what
--
what
the
bureau
has
done
and
i
think
with
the
knowledge
and
consent
of
congress
each
year
in
making
these
appropriations
is
to
treat
alaska
and
oklahoma
in
a
separate
category
and
it
maybe
that
at
various
times
and
various
other
places,
they
violated
their
own
regulations
and
given
welfare
to
people
off-reservations.
in
particular
instance,
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
you
describe
the
activities
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
as
whole
it
clearly
is
not
limited
to
on
reservation
indians
and
that
"on
or
near"
would
be
more
accurate,
but
it
does
things
for
indians
who
are
near
a
reservation
also.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there
are
near
a
reservation.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
the
health
program
that
quite
openly
is
for
indians
who
live
"on
or
near"
reservations.
in
this
work
relocation
program,
it's
for
the
benefit
of
indians
who
live
"on
or
near"
reservations,
but
it's
actually
put
into
effect
even
quite
distant
from
a
reservation,
in
some
city
where
there
maybe
employment.
so
i
am
not
arguing
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
is
precluded
or
doesn’t,
in
fact,
give
assistance
to
indians
off-reservations.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
their
general
welfare
program,
this
general
assistance
program
that
year
after
year
they
have
asked
congress
for
money
for
this
program,
for
activities
on
reservation,
maybe
they
should
have
described
it
a
little
broader
and
that
they
are
all
--
that
congress
has
appropriated
with
that
in
mind
and
has
appropriated
sums
of
money
that
only
fit
for
that
definition.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
what's
really
happening
is
i
think
--
i
think
you
have
to
isolate
the
alaska
and
oklahoma
situation
as
special
situations,
but
then
apart
from
that
i
think
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
will
try
to
make
as
broad
a
definition
of
on
reservation
as
they
can,
and
that
where
there
has
been
trust
land
involved
in
a
few
instances,
and
i
know
this
is
so,
people
of
bureau
of
indian
affairs
told
me
so
just
last
week
and
so
that
they
have
in
some
instances
have
given
welfare
to
people
who
live
on
trust
land,
near
the
reservations
in
situations
where
the
reservation
was
too
small
for
the
allotments
to
have
been
made
on
the
reservation,
and
the
government
found
land
for
people
off-reservation.
but
they
have
not
extended
that
to
people
who
do
not
live
on
trust
land
and
thus
are
not
under
the
direct
supervision
of
the
bureau
in
that
respect.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
when
i
say
trust
land,
i
am
not
drawing
a
distinction
between
that
and
alloted
land.
i
mean,
land
in
which
the
federal
government
is
still
the
trustee,
whether
it's
because
the
indian
had
an
allotment
and
doesn’t
yet
own
the
land
and
fee
or
for
any
other
reason.
now
i
think
it
is
clear
that
congress
has
not
appropriated
money
for
its
broader
program
as
the
petitioners
ask.
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
even
the
and
i
mean
respondent
asks
for,
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
even
the
respondents
say
that
they
don't
suggest
that
the
program
should
be
made
available
to
indians
throughout
the
united
states.
that
at
page
23
of
their
brief
they
say
we
have
never
argued
that
the
government
is
required
to
provide
the
subsistence
benefits
to
the
fully
assimilated
indian
residing
in
manhattan.
so
if
you
don't
use
the
boundary,
the
line
that
the
congress
and
the
bureau
has
set
up,
some
other
line
has
to
be
ticked
and
i
don't
think
that
the
line
“on
or
near”
reservations
is
going
to
get
any
more
satisfactory
judicial
answer
to
this
question
than
the
line
that
has
been
drawn
now
on
reservations
in
these
two
special
instances
of
alaska
and
oklahoma.
now,
i
want
to
say
a
word
that
bureau
of
indian
affairs
(inaudible)
on
this.
i
would
feel
easier
with
this
case
if
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
had
published
its
manual
in
the
federal
registers
because
i
think
what
they
have
done
--
i
don't
think
they
had
a
duty
to
have
rule
making
public
notice
in
open
hearings
because
this
is
for
benefits
and
so
forth
and
there
have
been
cases
that
it
tell
it's
not
necessary
there.
but
i
think
to
have
these
be
real
legislative
rules,
that
they
would
have
had
they
been
published
in
the
federal
register.
what
the
bia
actually
did
is
publish
in
the
federal
register
a
notice
that
it
has
in
this
manual
and
it's
available
to
the
public
at
the
washington
office
and
at
the
regional
offices
of
the
bia
which
is
something
like
a
substantial
compliance,
but
i
don't
say
that
it
really
is
compliance
with
that
statute.
so
we
are
left
with
the
rules
simply
as
interpretations
of
the
acts
of
congress
and
i
think
they
are
correct
interpretations
in
the
sense
that
this
is
all
that
the
bureau
asked
for
money
for
and
this
is
all
that
the
appropriations
gave
the
money
for.
so
when
the
bureau's
regulations
say
this
for
welfare
of
indians
on
reservations
and
in
alaska
and
oklahoma,
i
think
it's
just
same
with
the
congressional
acts
have
be
read
to
say
anyway.
but
the
court
disagrees
on
that,
i
think
that
these
congressional
acts
are
so
vague
and
that
the
discretion
left
to
the
bureau
is
so
large,
both
in
the
snyder
act
and
then
other
legislation
and
then
the
general
language
of
the
appropriation
act
which
is
just
general
appropriation,
that
the
bureau
does
have
rule
making
authority
here,
and
that
if
it
did
go
through
the
process
of
publishing
these
rules,
it
would
be
based
with
the
problem
then
whether
that
made
the
same
program
valid.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
the
only
challenge.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
they
will
make
constitutional
challenge
to
the
--
to
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
the
constitutional
challenge
was
made.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
before
the
court.
if
the
court
agrees
with
this
that
what
the
secretory
has
done
here
is
in
accord
with
the
congressional
legislation
or
with
it
as
legitimately
interpreted
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
then
i
think
you
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
we
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
is
to
--
is
so
that
in
the
areas
where
there
is
indian
government
or
the
most
direct
federal
supervision,
that
the
federal
government
does
supply
the
kind
of
welfare
program
that
could
be
supplied
on
a
county
basis
within
a
state,
but
if
where
people
move
out
of
those
areas
and
into
the
state
in
general,
a
decision
has
been
made
that
at
least
as
far
as
welfare
goes,
they
should
be
equated
with
the
other
people
in
the
state
and
have
whatever
benefit
is
there.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
not
bia
money
off
the
reservations
or
these
particular
areas.
i
think
it's
a
decision.
i
don't
think
it's
just
an
economy
measure,
but
i
think
it
is
a
decision
to
use
available
funds
in
the
core
area,
as
federal
responsibility.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
we
do
deny
that
it
has
an
impact
on
movement
of
any
legal
significance.
we
--
our
view
is
this.
if
you
want
to
accept
that
the
reservation
or
that
this
situation
in
alaska
or
oklahoma
is
legitimate
jurisdictional
kind
of
distinction
to
make
then
the
fact
that
if
someone
leaves
the
jurisdiction,
he
gives
up
certain
welfare
benefits
is
not
an
interference
with
his
right
of
travel
anymore
than
leaving
one
county
and
going
to
another
is
if
one
county
has
a
broader
welfare
program
than
another.
on
non-general
assistance,
the
welfare
programs
often
breakdown
to
county
by
county.
i
think
what
it
is,
the
government
is
seeing
a
serious
problem
of
unemployment
on
reservations
where
it
has
the
greatest
responsibility,
if
the
government
reacting
properly
to
that
problem,
setting
up
a
program,
but
if
the
government
simply
not
setting
up
program
that
goes
beyond
the
heart
area
of
its
responsibility.
now,
i
think
it
might
have
been
a
wise
decision
for
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
have
a
broader
program.
i
don't
argue
for
the
merits
of
their
decision
to
try
to
limit
this
program
or
there
have
been
acts
passed
--
acts
presented
to
congress,
it
would
have
provided
some
broader
programs
and
the
bureau
has
not
supported
them
and
congress
has
not
passed.
i
don't
speak
to
the
merits
of
that.
i
do
simply
say
that
i
think
constitutionally,
this
is
within
the
area
of
cases
such
as
dandridge
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
here,
that
the
difference
is
based
on
an
essential
jurisdictional
difference
and
whatever
the
wisdom
of
the
decision
that
congress
and
the
bia
have
made,
it's
legitimately
their
decision
to
make.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
30
seconds
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
have
any.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
held
essentially
that
a
supplemental
welfare
benefit
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
provides
for
indians
who
live
on
reservations
and
indians
who
live
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
oklahoma
and
alaska
must
be
applied,
must
be
made
available
for
indians
throughout
the
country.
the
court
did
that
not
on
constitutional
ground
but
as
an
interpretation
of
the
statutes
under
which
the
program
is
conducted.
we
think
that
that’s
a
misinterpretation
of
those
statutes
and
then
it
would
require
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
conduct
a
program
that
congress
has
not
appropriated
money
for.
and
it’s
on
that
basis
that
we
ask
the
court
to
review
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
i’d
like
to
take
a
minute
to
describe
what
the
program
is
that
we’re
talking
about.
through
the
social
security
act,
there
are
four
or
five,
i
think
its
four
types
of
categorical
welfare
assistance,
aid
for
dependent
children,
aid
for
the
blind,
and
so
forth
that
under
federal
sponsorship
available
throughout
the
country
through
the
states.
there's
another
which
is
under
a
different
legislation,
the
unemployment
insurance
program.
but
what’s
missing
from
this
program
that
is
available
throughout
the
united
states
is
anything
in
the
way
of
a
general
assistance
program
that
will
give
money
to
able-bodied
people
who
are
chronically
out
of
work.
now
this
is
the
issue
that
the
country
has
faced
in
terms
or
perhaps
has
failed
to
face
in
terms
of
a
negative
income
tax
or
some
sort
of
income
maintenance
program.
because
this
is
missing
from
the
federal
legislation,
the
states
have
done
with
it
pretty
much
as
it
please.
and
some
states
have
fairly
important
income
assistance
programs,
others
do
not.
some
states
do
it
on
a
statewide
basis.
others
do
it
county
by
county.
but
the
situation
became
clear
that
in
the
--
in
indian
reservation
where
the
indian
tribe
itself
has
the
basic
government
and
where
that
government
is
under
the
direct
supervision
of
the
federal
government.
that
the
federal
government
ought
to
undertake
this
kind
of
income
maintenance
program
and
it
did
undertake
this
kind
of
program
in
a
cash
payment
program
rather
than
giving
provisions
which
had
been
done
earlier
in
the
early
1950s
and
this
is
the
program
that
we’re
talking
about,
a
program
that
has
some
flaws
in
it
that
has
worked
fairly
well.
some
people
think,
other
people
think
that
it
tends
to
discourage
people
from
going
out
and
getting
jobs
but
this
is
the
program
and
the
questions
whether
indians
who
are
off
reservations
have
a
right
to
this
program
under
the
legislation.
and
eventually,
i
suppose
the
question
is
whether
it's
constitutional
to
make
this
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
residence
on
a
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
as
we
read
the
opinion
that
since
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
provides
this
supplemental
welfare
program
for
indians
on
reservations.
it
must
provide
it
for
indians
everywhere
or
at
least
in
a
narrow
screening
decision
is
that
it
must
provide
it
for
indians
in
this
situation
of
mr.
ruiz.
that
would
mean
mr.
ruiz
would
get
these
benefits
whereas
the
other
strikers
would
not.
i’d
like
to
take
a
minute
just
to
state
what
you’ve
already
alluded
to
and
that
is
the
situation
mr.
ruiz
here,
mr.
and
mrs.
ruiz.
mr.
and
mrs.
ruiz
are
papago
indians.
as
far
as
i
know,
full
blood.
they
lived
on
the
papago
reservation
until
1939
or
1940.
that
time,
mr.
ruiz
moved
16
miles
away
to
a
town
called
ajo.
he
moved
there
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
ajo.
thank
you.
he
moved
there,
he
got
a
job
in
the
copper
mines
and
he
apparently
worked
steadily
in
those
copper
mines
until
1967,
at
which
time
the
plant
went
out
on
strike.
nobody
under
arizona
law,
none
of
the
striking
workers
were
entitled
to
general
assistance
or
unemployment
compensation
payments.
mr.
ruiz
unable
to
get
the
arizona
payments
applied
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
see
whether
he
could
get
payments
there
and
he
was
denied
those
payments
on
the
basis
that
he
did
not,
neither
he
nor
his
wife
resided
on
the
reservation.
now,
i’d
like
to
discuss
the
statutes
that
under
which
the
bureau
operates
this
program.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
as
i
understand
it,
he
would
have
been
eligible
for
this
program.
he
had
resided
on
the
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct.
be
very
much
as
if
you
have
people
who
live
in
the
state
of
new
york
who
go
to
work
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
the
person
who
still
lives
in
new
york
will
get
whatever
benefits
the
state
of
new
york
offers
i
supposed
and
people
who
moved
from
the
state
of
new
york
and
moved
in
to
new
jersey
then
are
under
--
get
whatever
benefits
new
jersey
supplies
rather
than
new
york.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
your
honor,
he
is.
the
law
as
we
understand
it
has
every
court
that’s
ruled
on
it
so
far
has
held
that
an
indian
is
a
full-fledged
citizen
of
the
united
states
whether
he
lives
on
or
off
a
reservation
and
whatever
welfare
program
that
federal
government
offers
or
that
the
state
offers
--
statewide
would
have
to
be
available
on
reservations
as
well
as
off
reservations
and
this
program
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
i
think
they
--
that
they
agree
with
that
although
i
have
to
ask
them
that
but
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
i
think
it’s
for
that
reason
this
case
is
here.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
on
the
money,
i
would
assume
that
mr.
ruiz
pays
normal
federal
income
tax.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
so.
i
should
ask.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
strike
lasted
about
11
months
and
it’s
over.
on
the
statutory
base,
i
want
to
say
first
that
the
president,
sec
--
through
delegation,
secretary
of
interior
and
director
of
bureau
of
indian
affairs
have
very
broad
authority
under
25
u.s.c.
2
and
25
u.s.c.
9
to
make
such
rules
and
regulations
and
decisions
as
are
necessary
in
this
area.
but
the
act
that
we’re
primarily
concerned
with
here
is
the
snyder
act
which
was
passed
in
1922.
and
i
think
the
act
is
clear
on
its
face.
it’s
the
authorization
act
of
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
provide
health,
education,
welfare
and
all
sorts
of
other
services
to
indians
wherever
they
live
in
the
country.
we
don’t
say
that
this
act
prohibits
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
from
doing
things
for
indians
off
reservations.
but
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
act
simply
is
the
authorization
act
as
it
created
no
programs
and
legislative
history
is
clear
on
this
too
that
to
solve
points
of
order
that
there
was
no
authorization
for
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
congress
passed
this
particular
act.
i
won’t
burden
the
court
with
going
through
what
i’ve
done
in
detail
in
the
brief
there.
the
language
of
it
is
clear.
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
direct,
supervise
and
expend
such
moneys
as
congress
may
from
time
to
time,
appropriate,
for
the
benefit,
care,
and
assistance
of
the
indians
throughout
the
united
states
for
the
following
purposes:
general
support
civilization,
including
education.
at
the
time
this
act
was
passed
there
was
no
general
support
program,
financial
support
program
neither
on
or
off
indian
reservations
or
in
the
country
as
a
whole.
social
legislation
of
1930s
hadn’t
been
passed
at
that
time.
i
thought
it's
a
hard
question.
i
think
that
the
respondents
are
really
reaching
to
take
the
language
in
that
act
and
to
say
that
it
commands
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
institute
a
welfare
program
and
that
that
welfare
program
must
be
for
indians
both
on
and
off
the
reservations.
and
one,
i
would
say
certainly
neutral
observer
of
this
act,
mr.
wolf
who
at
one
point,
i
think
had
some
role
in
representing
the
respondents
in
this
case.
he's
written
a
very
good
law
review
article
on
this
subject
and
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
closed
yesterday,
i
was
about
to
say
that
i
thought
the
snyder
act
when
well
summed
up
by
mr.
wolf
who
at
earlier
stage
was
a
counsel
in
this
case,
which
he
described
the
act
in
law
review
article
this
way.
he
said
the
snyder
act
is
familiar
in
somewhat
distressing
occurrence
in
the
history
of
indian
affairs.
as
in
other
instances,
congress
enacted
a
very
general
measure
and
left
the
rest
up
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
bia.
i
think
that
is
what
the
snyder
act
did
do,
except
i
would
have
one
other
thing.
it
also
left
the
rest
up
to
future
congresses
in
their
appropriations
procedures.
now,
in
all
recent
years
including
the
appropriations
for
fiscal
year
1968,
which
are
at
issue
here,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
submitted
to
the
congress
request
for
funds
or
welfare
program
for
indians
in
this
language.
general
assistance
will
be
provided
to
needy
indians
on
reservations
who
are
not
eligible
for
public
assistance
under
the
social
security
act.
each
year
congress
has
published
that
language
in
its
reports
in
favor
of
the
bill.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
there
are
two
problems
there.
one
is
oklahoma
and
alaska.
i
think
it
is
just
simply
correct
that
this
statement
that
has
been
made
to
the
congress
is
a
compact
and
too
abbreviated
statement.
it
refer
to
be
absolutely
accurate.
it
should
say
for
indians
on
reservations
and
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
oklahoma
and
alaska.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
in
oklahoma
the
reason
is
following.
that
the
whole
section
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
was
once
indian
territory
and
was
totally
occupied
with
indian
reservations.
well,
the
second
part
of
this
what
i
am
getting
at.
the
reservations
have
been
abolished.
the
tribal
organizations
have
not
been
abolished.
the
indians
there
live
on
trust
property
and
with
a
good
deal
of
property
still
managed
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
such
as
in
the
mason
case
that
we
had
last
year
and
the
bureau's
interpretation
of
that
has
been
that
the
lands
that
it
administers
in
oklahoma
are
equivalent
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
has
also
made
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
where
there
indians
living
on
trust
land
that's
administered
by
the
agency
near
a
reservation,
they
simply
treat
that
as
if
it
were
on
the
reservation.
in
other
words,
they
haven't
been
as
rigid
in
saying
that
if
your
off
reservation,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
as
one
might
hope
for
a
mechanical
application
of
the
law.
what
they
have
said
is
in
the
turtle
mountain
incidence
--
they've
simply
equated
administratively
people
living
on
trust
land,
allotted
land.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
think
that's
trust
land
and
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
am
not
aware
of
them
getting
welfare
under
this
program
and
i
should
mention
that
there
is
another
program
that
does
quite
openly
and
under
congressional
authorization
provide
welfare
for
off-reservation
indians,
that
is
what
is
generally
called
the
relocation
program.
if
an
indian
lives
on
a
reservation
or
near
a
reservation,
and
he
cannot
get
a
job
and
he
wants
to
go
somewhere
else
to
look
for
a
job,
the
bureau
will
try
to
find
him
a
job
and
will
provide
him
general
assistance
for
several
years
when
he
first
begins
to
work.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
i
don't
want
to
go
that
far.
i
think
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
think
that,
that's
the
distinction
either
because
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
mr.
ruiz
is
not
a
member
of
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
tribal
organization.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
what
--
what
the
bureau
has
done
and
i
think
with
the
knowledge
and
consent
of
congress
each
year
in
making
these
appropriations
is
to
treat
alaska
and
oklahoma
in
a
separate
category
and
it
maybe
that
at
various
times
and
various
other
places,
they
violated
their
own
regulations
and
given
welfare
to
people
off-reservations.
in
particular
instance,
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
you
describe
the
activities
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
as
whole
it
clearly
is
not
limited
to
on
reservation
indians
and
that
"on
or
near"
would
be
more
accurate,
but
it
does
things
for
indians
who
are
near
a
reservation
also.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there
are
near
a
reservation.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
the
health
program
that
quite
openly
is
for
indians
who
live
"on
or
near"
reservations.
in
this
work
relocation
program,
it's
for
the
benefit
of
indians
who
live
"on
or
near"
reservations,
but
it's
actually
put
into
effect
even
quite
distant
from
a
reservation,
in
some
city
where
there
maybe
employment.
so
i
am
not
arguing
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
is
precluded
or
doesn’t,
in
fact,
give
assistance
to
indians
off-reservations.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
their
general
welfare
program,
this
general
assistance
program
that
year
after
year
they
have
asked
congress
for
money
for
this
program,
for
activities
on
reservation,
maybe
they
should
have
described
it
a
little
broader
and
that
they
are
all
--
that
congress
has
appropriated
with
that
in
mind
and
has
appropriated
sums
of
money
that
only
fit
for
that
definition.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
what's
really
happening
is
i
think
--
i
think
you
have
to
isolate
the
alaska
and
oklahoma
situation
as
special
situations,
but
then
apart
from
that
i
think
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
will
try
to
make
as
broad
a
definition
of
on
reservation
as
they
can,
and
that
where
there
has
been
trust
land
involved
in
a
few
instances,
and
i
know
this
is
so,
people
of
bureau
of
indian
affairs
told
me
so
just
last
week
and
so
that
they
have
in
some
instances
have
given
welfare
to
people
who
live
on
trust
land,
near
the
reservations
in
situations
where
the
reservation
was
too
small
for
the
allotments
to
have
been
made
on
the
reservation,
and
the
government
found
land
for
people
off-reservation.
but
they
have
not
extended
that
to
people
who
do
not
live
on
trust
land
and
thus
are
not
under
the
direct
supervision
of
the
bureau
in
that
respect.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
when
i
say
trust
land,
i
am
not
drawing
a
distinction
between
that
and
alloted
land.
i
mean,
land
in
which
the
federal
government
is
still
the
trustee,
whether
it's
because
the
indian
had
an
allotment
and
doesn’t
yet
own
the
land
and
fee
or
for
any
other
reason.
now
i
think
it
is
clear
that
congress
has
not
appropriated
money
for
its
broader
program
as
the
petitioners
ask.
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
even
the
and
i
mean
respondent
asks
for,
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
even
the
respondents
say
that
they
don't
suggest
that
the
program
should
be
made
available
to
indians
throughout
the
united
states.
that
at
page
23
of
their
brief
they
say
we
have
never
argued
that
the
government
is
required
to
provide
the
subsistence
benefits
to
the
fully
assimilated
indian
residing
in
manhattan.
so
if
you
don't
use
the
boundary,
the
line
that
the
congress
and
the
bureau
has
set
up,
some
other
line
has
to
be
ticked
and
i
don't
think
that
the
line
“on
or
near”
reservations
is
going
to
get
any
more
satisfactory
judicial
answer
to
this
question
than
the
line
that
has
been
drawn
now
on
reservations
in
these
two
special
instances
of
alaska
and
oklahoma.
now,
i
want
to
say
a
word
that
bureau
of
indian
affairs
(inaudible)
on
this.
i
would
feel
easier
with
this
case
if
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
had
published
its
manual
in
the
federal
registers
because
i
think
what
they
have
done
--
i
don't
think
they
had
a
duty
to
have
rule
making
public
notice
in
open
hearings
because
this
is
for
benefits
and
so
forth
and
there
have
been
cases
that
it
tell
it's
not
necessary
there.
but
i
think
to
have
these
be
real
legislative
rules,
that
they
would
have
had
they
been
published
in
the
federal
register.
what
the
bia
actually
did
is
publish
in
the
federal
register
a
notice
that
it
has
in
this
manual
and
it's
available
to
the
public
at
the
washington
office
and
at
the
regional
offices
of
the
bia
which
is
something
like
a
substantial
compliance,
but
i
don't
say
that
it
really
is
compliance
with
that
statute.
so
we
are
left
with
the
rules
simply
as
interpretations
of
the
acts
of
congress
and
i
think
they
are
correct
interpretations
in
the
sense
that
this
is
all
that
the
bureau
asked
for
money
for
and
this
is
all
that
the
appropriations
gave
the
money
for.
so
when
the
bureau's
regulations
say
this
for
welfare
of
indians
on
reservations
and
in
alaska
and
oklahoma,
i
think
it's
just
same
with
the
congressional
acts
have
be
read
to
say
anyway.
but
the
court
disagrees
on
that,
i
think
that
these
congressional
acts
are
so
vague
and
that
the
discretion
left
to
the
bureau
is
so
large,
both
in
the
snyder
act
and
then
other
legislation
and
then
the
general
language
of
the
appropriation
act
which
is
just
general
appropriation,
that
the
bureau
does
have
rule
making
authority
here,
and
that
if
it
did
go
through
the
process
of
publishing
these
rules,
it
would
be
based
with
the
problem
then
whether
that
made
the
same
program
valid.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
the
only
challenge.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
they
will
make
constitutional
challenge
to
the
--
to
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
the
constitutional
challenge
was
made.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
before
the
court.
if
the
court
agrees
with
this
that
what
the
secretory
has
done
here
is
in
accord
with
the
congressional
legislation
or
with
it
as
legitimately
interpreted
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
then
i
think
you
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
we
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
is
to
--
is
so
that
in
the
areas
where
there
is
indian
government
or
the
most
direct
federal
supervision,
that
the
federal
government
does
supply
the
kind
of
welfare
program
that
could
be
supplied
on
a
county
basis
within
a
state,
but
if
where
people
move
out
of
those
areas
and
into
the
state
in
general,
a
decision
has
been
made
that
at
least
as
far
as
welfare
goes,
they
should
be
equated
with
the
other
people
in
the
state
and
have
whatever
benefit
is
there.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
not
bia
money
off
the
reservations
or
these
particular
areas.
i
think
it's
a
decision.
i
don't
think
it's
just
an
economy
measure,
but
i
think
it
is
a
decision
to
use
available
funds
in
the
core
area,
as
federal
responsibility.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
we
do
deny
that
it
has
an
impact
on
movement
of
any
legal
significance.
we
--
our
view
is
this.
if
you
want
to
accept
that
the
reservation
or
that
this
situation
in
alaska
or
oklahoma
is
legitimate
jurisdictional
kind
of
distinction
to
make
then
the
fact
that
if
someone
leaves
the
jurisdiction,
he
gives
up
certain
welfare
benefits
is
not
an
interference
with
his
right
of
travel
anymore
than
leaving
one
county
and
going
to
another
is
if
one
county
has
a
broader
welfare
program
than
another.
on
non-general
assistance,
the
welfare
programs
often
breakdown
to
county
by
county.
i
think
what
it
is,
the
government
is
seeing
a
serious
problem
of
unemployment
on
reservations
where
it
has
the
greatest
responsibility,
if
the
government
reacting
properly
to
that
problem,
setting
up
a
program,
but
if
the
government
simply
not
setting
up
program
that
goes
beyond
the
heart
area
of
its
responsibility.
now,
i
think
it
might
have
been
a
wise
decision
for
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
have
a
broader
program.
i
don't
argue
for
the
merits
of
their
decision
to
try
to
limit
this
program
or
there
have
been
acts
passed
--
acts
presented
to
congress,
it
would
have
provided
some
broader
programs
and
the
bureau
has
not
supported
them
and
congress
has
not
passed.
i
don't
speak
to
the
merits
of
that.
i
do
simply
say
that
i
think
constitutionally,
this
is
within
the
area
of
cases
such
as
dandridge
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
here,
that
the
difference
is
based
on
an
essential
jurisdictional
difference
and
whatever
the
wisdom
of
the
decision
that
congress
and
the
bia
have
made,
it's
legitimately
their
decision
to
make.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
30
seconds
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
have
any.
