and
they’re
all
living

well,
are
you
saying
that
the
department
of
the
interior
may
do
this
on
a
discretionary
basis
from
time-to-time
but
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
no
such
a
discretion,
that
the
essence
of
--
the
ninth
circuit
has
no
--
no
authority
to
say
that
this
extends
to
all
the
indians
off

the
long
history
of
the
actual
application
of

provision

some
significance?
chief
justice
warren
e.

wouldn't
that
have
been
true
in
the
dandridge
case
of
her
recipient
living
in
baltimore
had
moved
over
to
the
eastern
shore
or
some
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
saying
that
by
moving,
you
are
talking
about
the
right
to
travel,

involved
in
