justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
presents
an
issue
in
the
administration
of
the
federal
assistance
program
for
needy
indians.
that
issue
is
whether
the
general
assistance
benefits
are
available
only
to
indians
living
on
reservations
in
the
united
states
or
to
put
it
conversely,
whether
they
are
unavailable
to
indians
who
live
off,
wherever
they
live,
or
whether
they
--
to
those
who
live
off
although
near
a
reservation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
by
divided
vote,
reversed
a
district
court
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
against
the
respondents
here.
the
respondents
are
mr.
and
mrs.
ruiz
who
are
papago
indians.
they
lived
on
the
reservation
in
arizona,
but
left
it
in
1940
to
seek
employment
15
miles
away
at
the
copper
mines
at
ajo.
mr.
ruiz
found
work
there,
and
they
settled
in
a
community
indian
village.
the
ruizes
have
lived
continuously
since
1940
and
apart
from
his
work
in
the
copper
mine,
however,
they
have
not
been
assimilated
into
the
dominant
culture
and
they
have
maintained
a
close
tie
with
the
nearby
reservation.
in
1967
the
mine
was
shut
down
by
a
strike.
mr.
ruiz
received
$15
a
week
striker's
benefits
paid
by
his
union.
he
was
denied
welfare
benefits
by
the
state
of
arizona,
and
he
then
applied
for
general
assistance
benefits
from
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
this
relief
was
denied
him
on
the
ground
that
one
to
be
eligible
for
general
assistance
had
to
be
living
on
an
indian
reservation.
this
was
the
sole
ground
for
that
denial.
the
present
action
was
then
instituted
against
the
secretary.
entitlement
to
general
assistance
was
claimed
both
on
statutory
grounds
and
on
constitutional
grounds.
this
took
us
directly
to
the
so
called
snyder
act
of
1921,
which
authorizes
in
very
broad
terms
the
general
assistance
program.
it
also
takes
us
to
the
several
annual
appropriations
acts
for
the
bia
program.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
snyder
act
contained
no
geographical
limitations
on
indian
programs,
and
that
the
secretary
was
powerless
to
shrink
coverage
down
to
some
lesser
group
of
indian
beneficiaries
than
the
all
inclusive
group
of
indians
throughout
the
country.
in
a
long
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
we
do
so
on
a
ground
narrower
than
not
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit.
we
do
not
resolve
the
issue
whether
congress
intended
for
all
indians,
regardless
of
residence
and
that
the
degree
of
assimilation
to
be
eligible
for
the
general
assistance
program.
we
look
only
at
the
intent
of
congress
with
respect
to
indian
complainants
of
the
kind
in
the
case
before
us
and
we
hold
that
those
claimants
who
are
a
full-blooded
un-assimilated
indians,
living
in
an
indian
community
near
their
native
reservation,
and
who
maintain
close
economic
and
social
ties
with
that
reservation,
are
eligible
for
the
general
assistance
benefits.
we
also
touch
upon
the
necessity
of
the
bureau's
complying
with
the
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
when
it
makes
classifications
in
the
administration
of
general
assistance
program.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
