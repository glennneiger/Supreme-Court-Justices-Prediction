mr.
peter
f.
langrock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
that
was
initiated
in
the
united
states
district
court,
from
the
district
of
vermont
on
behalf
of
the
zahns
and
the
leaser
and
other
personnel
similarly
situated.
it
was
brought
against
international
paper
company
and
the
facts
of
the
matter
alleged
certain
problems
with
the
pollution
of
lake
champlain
as
affecting
the
plaintiffs
and
the
class.
the
particular
mill
about
in
ticonderoga
is
also
the
subject
of
another
matter
before
this
court,
which
has
been
referred
to
a
master
in
chancery.
the
district
judge
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
class
action
aspects
of
the
case
took
the
matter
under
advisement.
he
appeared
before
him
and
after
a
period
of
time,
he
dismissed
the
class
action
aspects
of
the
case
with
and
i
quote
from
his
opinion
“great
reluctance”.
the
matter
was
then
appealed
to
the
second
circuit
of
court
of
appeals,
an
interlocutory
appeal,
permission
being
granted
by
the
circuit
as
well
as
asked
for
by
the
district
court.
there
they
have
divided
opinion,
it
was
affirmed
the
en
banc
proceedings
was
rather
complicated
with
four
of
the
active
judges
of
seven
boarding
for
en
banc,
but
failing
to
en
banc
because
of
a
failure
to
achieve
the
majority
of
five,
and,
certiorari
was
granted
to
this
court.
the
basic
issue
presented
is
rather
a
narrow
one,
and
that
is
whether
a
united
states
district
court
judge
is
prohibited
from
taking
jurisdiction
of
a
class
action
where
one
on
one
members
of
the
class
might
not
reach
the
jurisdictional
amount.
in
looking
at
the
rule,
this
is
a
23
(b)
(3)
proceeding
and
the
rule
initially
requires
before
any
court
can
take
jurisdiction
of
the
class,
a
finding
that
the
class
is
superior
to
other
available
methods
to
the
fair
and
efficient
adjudication
of
the
controversy.
the
first
proposition
that
i
put
to
the
court
is
that
one
can
really
reduce
this
case
to
a
mathematical
formula,
that
if
we
assume
that
a
case
on
all
effects
can
be
efficient,
in
the
court
when
it
isn’t
sufficient.
we
then,
if
it
is
not
efficient,
the
court
is
prohibited
the
district
court
from
taking
jurisdiction.
if
it
is
efficient
then
we
have
two
choices,
either
the
court
may
take
jurisdiction
as
a
class
or
it
is
prohibited.
under
this
ruling
it
is
prohibited
from
taking
jurisdiction,
and
so
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
have
to
disagree
with
that,
sir.
the
opinion
i
think
states
quite
clearly
that
it
was
dismissed
solely
on
the
prohibitation
of
snyder
versus
harris,
and
that
it
was
dismissed
with
great
reluctance,
and
that
is
his
words.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
assuming
that
only
members
of
the
class
had
reached
the
jurisdictional
amount,
in
other
words,
if
you
define
your
class
at
10,000.
then,
he
would
say,
that
would
be
impossible,
and
therefore,
he
refused
to
redefine
the
class
excluding
members
who
would
have
less
in
the
jurisdictional
amount
of
the
10,000.
the
question
that
--
the
policy
question
here,
i
think,
in
so
much
before
the
court
and
in
class
actions
is
the
question
of
judicial
efficiency.
i
would
promote
that
this
type
of
class
action.
now,
this
is
not
a
--
i
consider
unmanageable
class
action,
this
is
not
a
manufactured
one.
this
is
a
real
controversy
involving
approximately
240
owners
of
the
lake
on
the
lake
shore.
this
is
a
case
which
is
going
forward
in
the
federal
district
court
where
there’s
a
class
action
or
individually
on
the
merits.
the
question
of
multiple
litigation
that
made
arise,
if
the
class
action
were
not
allowed,
maybe
very
extensive.
it
may
be
done
several
state
courts,
in
other
district
courts,
it
may
well
be
multiple
litigation
in
the
same
district
court.
we
think
that
the
judicial
efficiency
of
this
type
of
approach.
this
is
the
--
a
proper
place
for
a
class
action,
he
was
whether
--
is
re-litigation.
litigation
was
already
--
the
facts
that
have
already
been
involved
in
the
supreme
court
matter.
this
matter
is
not
going
to
go
away,
and
we
think
the
district
court
should
be
allowed
to
make
a
finding
that
this
is
the
superior,
most
efficient
way
of
handling
it.
and,
if
that
is
not
the
case,
then
he
is
prohibited
under
the
rule
23
of
taking
it
at
any
case.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
do
not
believe
so,
sir.
that
case
goes
back
prior
to
be
change
of
the
rule.
that
was
an
action
where
some
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
did
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
one
of
them
did
and
he
was
allowed
to
proceed.
there
was
on
the
face
of
the
record,
certain
aspects
of
the
case
which
are
not
present
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
there
were
people
who
did
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and
the
effect
--
looking
at
the
change
of
the
rule,
one
of
the
problems,
one
of
the
reason
for
the
change
of
the
rule
was
that
it
was
an
awkward
situation.
we’re
talking
about
spurious,
or
what
have
you.
and
the
rule
simply
states
what
test
should
be,
empirical
test
to
meet
the
class
action
with
a
lot
of
safeguards.
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
previous
reasoning
of
clark
versus
gray
calls
for
overruling.
perhaps
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
well,
i
again
would
beg
--
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
had
in
the
statute
is
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction,
diversity
of
citizenship
plus
the
jurisdictional
amount.
there
have
been
times
in
this
court
when
matter
is
not
meeting
the
jurisdictional
amount,
when
matter
is
not
needing
the
diversity
of
requirement
had
been
allowed
when
attached
to
a
case
with
this
proper
jurisdiction.
the
whole
concept
to
the
ancillary
pendent
jurisdiction.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
clearly
set
forth
doctrine,
that
absolute
diversity
is
not
required
when
the
main
case
has
jurisdiction.
and
to
me,
it’s
not
logical
to
say
that
one
can
proceed
when
you
don’t
have
complete
diversity,
which
is
one
requirement
of
the
statute
but
you
must
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and,
this
is
even
more
so
because
the
diversity
requirement
is
really
a
constitutional
doctrine
where
the
amount
in
controversy
is
a
statutory
one.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
cases
and
i
think
without
getting
into
a
complete
analysis
of
clark.
i
think
clark
misconstrued
its
previous
precedence,
and
it’s
really
a
dictum
in
clark,
the
peculiar
situation
in
that
case.
i
don’t
think
clark
needs
to
be
overruled
to
reach
our
result.
i
think
that
it
needs
is
to
be
set
forth
in
its
proper
context.
what
we
have
here
is
whether
or
not
the
jurisdiction
is
totally
prohibited.
and,
i
don’t
think
that
the
concept
of
ancillary
pendent
jurisdiction
is
prohibited
by
clark.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
this
is
a
diversity,
based
on
diversity
and
not
on
controversy.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
there
perhaps
is
but
there
are
several
questions
of
state
law,
that
are
involved
and
it
was
brought
under
the
diversity
statute.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
certainly,
it
would
be
on
pendent,
but
as
you
come
to
the
concept
of
pendent
is
being
affirmed,
it
says
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
don’t
think
so,
i
think
that
the
at
least
the
lower
courts
had
brought
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
strictly
state
claims
of
the
circuit
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
there’s
not
much
case
law
as
such
on
it,
but
there’s
certainly
cases
which
do
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
we
think
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
before
this
court.
that
the
court
has
never
ruled
with
regard
to
whether
a
court
may
take
other
controversies
into
its
orbit,
when
it
is
efficient
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
state
law
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
state
law.
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
there
is
a
--
in
the
pleadings,
i
mention
some
federal
claims
basically
it’s
a
state
law.
and
riparian
rights,
lawsuits.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
millers
on
one
side
of
the
lake
and
the
landowners
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
there
is
a
state
line
in
between
them.
there
are
various
reasons
in
the
law
that
we
have
made
election
to
proceed
on
this,
i
think
there
is
possibility
for
federal
jurisdiction
independent
of
that.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
plant
was
closed
several
months
after
the
initiation
of
this
lawsuit.
it
was
--
the
sludge
bed
which
is
still
affecting
the
landowners
is
still
present,
and
that
there’s
much
litigation
whether
that
should
be
removed
or
not
removed
or
how
to
be
disposed
of.
but
the
effects
of
the
pollution
are
still
very
much
in
effect.
one
of
the
two
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
you
maybe
sir,
i’m
not
familiar
with
that
question.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
complaint
that
we
have
drawn
in
this
case
alleges
three
basic
counts,
it
states
a
factual
pattern.
we
were
the
--
class
action
of
the
case
was
dismissed
at
a
very
early
stage.
the
law
of
the
case
is
not
yet
been
fully
developed.
there
is
an
allegation
of
federal
violation
in
the
complaint.
but
basically,
the
count
sound
in
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
vermont
rather
than
any
federal
state
statutory
law.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
this
is
correct,
we
stated
under
the
civil
rules,
a
complaint
stating
a
factual
basis,
which
we
believe
calls
for
relief.
we
believe
we’re
entitled
to
relief
under
the
diversity
and
state
argument.
we
also
believe
they
may
well
develop
a
federal
concept
out
of
that,
but
to
be
quite
candid,
we
have
not
developed
that
question
because
of
the
jurisdictional
point
yet.
and
we
certainly
that
would
--
at
least
with
the
court.
as
the
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
that’s
right.
our
complaint
alleges
diversity
is
based
on
diversity
sections.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
think
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
responding
to
the
ben-hur
situation.
we
think
that
is
still
the
good
law
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
complete
diversity
where
the
case
and
controversy.
the
case
before
the
court,
there
is
full
diversity,
and
ancillary
pendent
matters
can
come
before
the
court.
we
fail
to
see
how
the
diversity
requirement
should
be
differently
treated
than
the
amounting
controversy.
the
effect
of
this
case
if
it
is
not
--
i
should
point
out
one
more
thing
too
and
that
is
there
is
big
body
of
case
law
which
in
the
question
of
intervention
is
a
matter
of
right
under
2482,
indicates
that
there’s
not
a
need
for
independent
jurisdictional
amount
where
the
first
case
has.
and,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
--
the
problems
would
come
about
if
this
court
does
not
recognize
that
where
in
the
efficient
cause
of
the
administration
of
justice,
you
got
have
this
finding
first,
that
a
court
is
prohibited
from
taking
jurisdiction
over
a
class.
not
only
does
it
destroy
the
class
action
concept
wherever
there
is
a
federal
question
requiring
an
amount
in
controversy,
or
a
diversity
question
involving
the
amount
in
controversy.
but
it
has
effects
on
the
question
of
the
development
of
the
concept
of
pendent
or
ancillary
jurisdiction.
it
has
the
effect
on
the
law
involving
intervention
of
right,
and
i
don’t
see
how
logically
one
can
say
that
can
take
jurisdiction
on
cases
which
don’t
need
jurisdictional
requirements
ancillary
in
certain
cases
and
not
on
others.
what
i’m
arguing
here
for
is
not
an
expansion
of
any
law
as
i
see
it
but
merely
an
application
of
law
to
those
cases
where
we
can
efficiently
put
this
in
to
the
hands
of
the
district
judge.
let
the
man
who
is
on
the
spot
make
the
decision
but
let’s
not
tie
his
hands,
let’s
not
force
this
into
several
pieces
of
litigation.
let’s
not
force
this
on
the
state
courts,
three
pieces,
we
have
six
cases
in
the
vermont
district
court,
that
we
have
enjoined
the
problem,
that’s
just
as
difficult
to
try.
the
district
class
action
case
influences
on
the
damages
question.
he
is
a
master.
if
you
do
things,
you
can
deal
with
what
is
really
a
major
problem.
a
serious
pollution
situation
in
the
most
inefficient,
intelligent
manner
before,
and
we
would
hate
to
see
that
court
prohibit
it
from
doing
so,
and
this
is
what
this
amounts
to.
we
would
suggest
that
the
arguments
of
the
defendant
in
this
matter
are
really
the
one
class
action
because
it
causes
problems
for
them
not
because
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
at
the
time
this
was
initiated.
there
was
no
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
well,
i
expect
that
if
that
were
filed
in
state
court,
we
might
have
removal
of
petition.
and,
we
are
faced
with
same
jurisdictional
question.
i
have
seen
another
cases
previously
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
at
that
point,
it
would
be.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
at
the
time
this
case
was
initiated,
there
was
no
state
class
action
proceeding.
there
was
a
proceeding
that
was
--
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
amended
subsequently
to
allow
it.
but
in
any
case,
whether
or
not,
the
congress
has
given
a
choice
on
diversity
both
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant.
the
question
is
not
--
whether
or
not
that
we
have
a
diversity
but
it’s
how
to
make
efficient
use,
and
to
prevent
any
more
litigation
than
is
necessary
given
the
diversity
situation
that
we
have
in
congress.
it
seems
to
me
in
conclusion
that
the
court
is
faced
with
two
choices
here.
a
most
restrictive
ruling
which
prohibits
the
district
judge
from
what
i
--
i
think
in
the
mathematical
sense,
prohibits
him
from
using
this
when
it’s
a
good
proof.
and,
there’s
nothing
here,
this
is
not
a
case
of
six
million
of
publication.
this
is
a
piece
of
real
litigation
before
the
courts
and
if
the
district
judge
and
that
we
are
asking
this
to
be
remanded
not
for
necessarily
a
class
action
for
the
termination
that
if
the
court
feels,
it
is
the
proper
tool
that
it
can
do
so,
and
it
is
not
prohibited
by
the
fact
that
one
or
more
persons
in
the
class
may
not
have
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount.
the
alternative
would
be
to
tie
the
hands
of
district
court
and
in
doing
so
i
think
bring
up
the
various
problems
i
have
mentioned,
thank
you.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
just
want
to
make
a
couple
of
comments
regarding
mr.
whipple’s
argument.
he
talks
about
causing
arised
in
the
federal
case
law.
if
i
read
the
mandate
of
23
(b)
(3)
right.
the
only
time
that
this
could
be
done
is
when
it
is
efficient
and
the
only
time
when
the
court
could
do
so
is
when
it
is
going
to
save
judicial
time
across
the
aspect.
and,
i
think
--
this
“parade
of
horribles”
which
was
suggested
by
mr.
whipple,
i
think
aren’t
true.
let
us
go
back
to
the
district
court,
i
don’t
want
to
argue
here,
we’re
going
have
a
mass
trial
of
240
people
or
the
merits
of
the
issue.
but
i’ll
say,
let
the
district
court
judge,
look
at
this
thing.
let
them
sit
by
on
the
issue,
and
make
a
decision,
how
am
i
going
to
handle
this
problem
involving
a
serious
number
of
people
who
are
affected
in
a
peculiar
way
by
acts.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor,
he
indicated
that
it
could
not
be
managed
if
he
had
to
separate
out
those
who
had
$10,000
and
those
who
didn’t.
you
got
to
have
to
try
the
damages
before
you
could
get
to
the
defendant
class,
but
his
opinion
said
with
great
reluctance.
he
dismissed
the
suit,
because
of
the
holdings
of
snyder
versus
harris,
and
so
i
think
we
should
really
leave
that
decision
in
the
hands
of
the
judge
who
is
going
to
have
to
make
that
decision
on
the
trial
court.
you
have
to
leave
that
one
way
or
another,
and,
if
we
lose
there,
i
think
that
takes
care
of
the
issue.
i
apologize
to
the
court,
i
not
recognize
a
name
of
illinois
versus
milwaukee,
that
case
was
decided
after
we
brought
this
and
i
am
familiar
with
the
case
but
i’m
not
quite
sure
as
mr.
whipple
knows
exactly
what
the
effects
of
the
common
law
of
the
federal
common
law
environmental
matters
on
water
waste,
how
this
would
affect
it?
in
any
case,
i
think
we
still
would
be
involved
in
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
it
would
make
the
pendent
concept
--
what
brings
the
pendent
situation
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
no,
there
would
be
--
would
be
with
the
with
the
state
ancillary
right
where
right
now,
we
have
to
go
into
the
pendent
in
part,
if
there
is
a
federal
claim
in
the
both
situation.
i
also
would
like
--
this
is
not
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
not
very
much,
i
think
we
should
all
hit
the
$10,000,
the
question
is
to
where.
these
are
other
efficiencies,
which
tie
into
this
type
of
thing.
the
efficiency
is
an
expert
time
--
the
efficiency’s
all
the
way
along
the
line
in
this
whole
environmental
field.
but
i
don’t
think
i
want
to
get
in
to
that
but
the
statement
that
this
sounds
in
nuisance
and
trespass
are
only
two
of
the
three
areas
which
it
sounds.
it
also
sounds
in
the
property
rights,
riparian
rights
of
joining
owners
on
a
lake,
or
of
not
at
this
really,
joining
but
owners
in
the
same
body
of
water.
and
we
think
that
if
ever
there
was
a
common
nucleus
of
fact,
this
is
it,
international
paper
company,
we
allege
has
done
one
thing.
and
it
has
continuously
done
this
thing
and
this
affects
a
large
number.
the
only
difference
here
would
be
the
question
of
damages
and
that
can
be
handled
we
suggest
in
a
multitude
of
worries
including
the
possibility
of
the
mass
sorting
amount.
and
we
don't
see
the
powers
of
the
mass
trial,
i
can
say
on
the
either
side
that
to
have
240
trials
on
the
issue
of
the
merits
frightens
me
a
great
deal
more
than
to
have
some
procedure
in
dealing
with
damages
on
a
common
set
of
facts.
the
comment
was
made
that
snyder
has
nothing
for
--
snyder,
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
did
not
come
into
snyder.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
snyder,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
begin
with.
that
was
not
a
case
that
was
going
forward
and
there
was
nothing
for
ancillary
to
hang
its
--
hang
on
to
tie
into.
and
i
would
not
have
been
gone
forward
in
the
courts
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
not
independent
jurisdiction
as
there
is
in
this
case.
and
i
might
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
may
very
well
have
a
class
here
or
there
maybe
other
classes
where
we
have
a
50
or
200,
250
with
only
one
or
two
claims.
and
to
prohibit
the
district
judge
as
a
jurisdictional
matter
from
going
forward
is
not
promoting
efficiency
as
suggested
by
my
opponent.
but
it
is
the
time
in
the
court’s
hands
for
using
it
in
a
proper
case.
i
am
not
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
this
matter
should
be
handled
as
a
class
action
unless
it
meets
the
text.
and
that
text
is
that
it
is
superior
to
other
matters,
other
ways
of
handling
this
as
an
efficient
way
in
the
controversy.
the
very
rule
of
23
(b)
(3)
itself,
if
it
doesn’t
meet
that,
we’re
out,
and
if
we
do
meet
that,
i
would
hate
to
see
the
district
court
judge
forced
at
a
jurisdictional
question
to
make
it
a
less
efficient
approach.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
no,
i
don’t,
your
honor,
i
think
if
we
went
back
with
some
of
the
amendment
rules,
which
might
be
appropriate
but
here,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
a
reason
on
this
one
and
i
think
that
this
is
where
we
are
here.
i
think
i
would
have
to
stand
on
that
position.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
federal
calendar
is
more
current
in
those
parts.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
depending
upon
the
counties
but
for
the
most
part,
the
federal
courts
--
the
federal
courts
is
as
current
as
any
state
court
calendar,
and
there
are
some
state
court
calendars
which
are
substantial
behind
the
federal
court
calendar.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
that
was
initiated
in
the
united
states
district
court,
from
the
district
of
vermont
on
behalf
of
the
zahns
and
the
leaser
and
other
personnel
similarly
situated.
it
was
brought
against
international
paper
company
and
the
facts
of
the
matter
alleged
certain
problems
with
the
pollution
of
lake
champlain
as
affecting
the
plaintiffs
and
the
class.
the
particular
mill
about
in
ticonderoga
is
also
the
subject
of
another
matter
before
this
court,
which
has
been
referred
to
a
master
in
chancery.
the
district
judge
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
class
action
aspects
of
the
case
took
the
matter
under
advisement.
he
appeared
before
him
and
after
a
period
of
time,
he
dismissed
the
class
action
aspects
of
the
case
with
and
i
quote
from
his
opinion
“great
reluctance”.
the
matter
was
then
appealed
to
the
second
circuit
of
court
of
appeals,
an
interlocutory
appeal,
permission
being
granted
by
the
circuit
as
well
as
asked
for
by
the
district
court.
there
they
have
divided
opinion,
it
was
affirmed
the
en
banc
proceedings
was
rather
complicated
with
four
of
the
active
judges
of
seven
boarding
for
en
banc,
but
failing
to
en
banc
because
of
a
failure
to
achieve
the
majority
of
five,
and,
certiorari
was
granted
to
this
court.
the
basic
issue
presented
is
rather
a
narrow
one,
and
that
is
whether
a
united
states
district
court
judge
is
prohibited
from
taking
jurisdiction
of
a
class
action
where
one
on
one
members
of
the
class
might
not
reach
the
jurisdictional
amount.
in
looking
at
the
rule,
this
is
a
23
(b)
(3)
proceeding
and
the
rule
initially
requires
before
any
court
can
take
jurisdiction
of
the
class,
a
finding
that
the
class
is
superior
to
other
available
methods
to
the
fair
and
efficient
adjudication
of
the
controversy.
the
first
proposition
that
i
put
to
the
court
is
that
one
can
really
reduce
this
case
to
a
mathematical
formula,
that
if
we
assume
that
a
case
on
all
effects
can
be
efficient,
in
the
court
when
it
isn’t
sufficient.
we
then,
if
it
is
not
efficient,
the
court
is
prohibited
the
district
court
from
taking
jurisdiction.
if
it
is
efficient
then
we
have
two
choices,
either
the
court
may
take
jurisdiction
as
a
class
or
it
is
prohibited.
under
this
ruling
it
is
prohibited
from
taking
jurisdiction,
and
so
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
have
to
disagree
with
that,
sir.
the
opinion
i
think
states
quite
clearly
that
it
was
dismissed
solely
on
the
prohibitation
of
snyder
versus
harris,
and
that
it
was
dismissed
with
great
reluctance,
and
that
is
his
words.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
assuming
that
only
members
of
the
class
had
reached
the
jurisdictional
amount,
in
other
words,
if
you
define
your
class
at
10,000.
then,
he
would
say,
that
would
be
impossible,
and
therefore,
he
refused
to
redefine
the
class
excluding
members
who
would
have
less
in
the
jurisdictional
amount
of
the
10,000.
the
question
that
--
the
policy
question
here,
i
think,
in
so
much
before
the
court
and
in
class
actions
is
the
question
of
judicial
efficiency.
i
would
promote
that
this
type
of
class
action.
now,
this
is
not
a
--
i
consider
unmanageable
class
action,
this
is
not
a
manufactured
one.
this
is
a
real
controversy
involving
approximately
240
owners
of
the
lake
on
the
lake
shore.
this
is
a
case
which
is
going
forward
in
the
federal
district
court
where
there’s
a
class
action
or
individually
on
the
merits.
the
question
of
multiple
litigation
that
made
arise,
if
the
class
action
were
not
allowed,
maybe
very
extensive.
it
may
be
done
several
state
courts,
in
other
district
courts,
it
may
well
be
multiple
litigation
in
the
same
district
court.
we
think
that
the
judicial
efficiency
of
this
type
of
approach.
this
is
the
--
a
proper
place
for
a
class
action,
he
was
whether
--
is
re-litigation.
litigation
was
already
--
the
facts
that
have
already
been
involved
in
the
supreme
court
matter.
this
matter
is
not
going
to
go
away,
and
we
think
the
district
court
should
be
allowed
to
make
a
finding
that
this
is
the
superior,
most
efficient
way
of
handling
it.
and,
if
that
is
not
the
case,
then
he
is
prohibited
under
the
rule
23
of
taking
it
at
any
case.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
do
not
believe
so,
sir.
that
case
goes
back
prior
to
be
change
of
the
rule.
that
was
an
action
where
some
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
did
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
one
of
them
did
and
he
was
allowed
to
proceed.
there
was
on
the
face
of
the
record,
certain
aspects
of
the
case
which
are
not
present
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
there
were
people
who
did
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and
the
effect
--
looking
at
the
change
of
the
rule,
one
of
the
problems,
one
of
the
reason
for
the
change
of
the
rule
was
that
it
was
an
awkward
situation.
we’re
talking
about
spurious,
or
what
have
you.
and
the
rule
simply
states
what
test
should
be,
empirical
test
to
meet
the
class
action
with
a
lot
of
safeguards.
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
previous
reasoning
of
clark
versus
gray
calls
for
overruling.
perhaps
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
well,
i
again
would
beg
--
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
had
in
the
statute
is
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction,
diversity
of
citizenship
plus
the
jurisdictional
amount.
there
have
been
times
in
this
court
when
matter
is
not
meeting
the
jurisdictional
amount,
when
matter
is
not
needing
the
diversity
of
requirement
had
been
allowed
when
attached
to
a
case
with
this
proper
jurisdiction.
the
whole
concept
to
the
ancillary
pendent
jurisdiction.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
clearly
set
forth
doctrine,
that
absolute
diversity
is
not
required
when
the
main
case
has
jurisdiction.
and
to
me,
it’s
not
logical
to
say
that
one
can
proceed
when
you
don’t
have
complete
diversity,
which
is
one
requirement
of
the
statute
but
you
must
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and,
this
is
even
more
so
because
the
diversity
requirement
is
really
a
constitutional
doctrine
where
the
amount
in
controversy
is
a
statutory
one.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
cases
and
i
think
without
getting
into
a
complete
analysis
of
clark.
i
think
clark
misconstrued
its
previous
precedence,
and
it’s
really
a
dictum
in
clark,
the
peculiar
situation
in
that
case.
i
don’t
think
clark
needs
to
be
overruled
to
reach
our
result.
i
think
that
it
needs
is
to
be
set
forth
in
its
proper
context.
what
we
have
here
is
whether
or
not
the
jurisdiction
is
totally
prohibited.
and,
i
don’t
think
that
the
concept
of
ancillary
pendent
jurisdiction
is
prohibited
by
clark.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
this
is
a
diversity,
based
on
diversity
and
not
on
controversy.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
there
perhaps
is
but
there
are
several
questions
of
state
law,
that
are
involved
and
it
was
brought
under
the
diversity
statute.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
certainly,
it
would
be
on
pendent,
but
as
you
come
to
the
concept
of
pendent
is
being
affirmed,
it
says
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
don’t
think
so,
i
think
that
the
at
least
the
lower
courts
had
brought
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
strictly
state
claims
of
the
circuit
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
there’s
not
much
case
law
as
such
on
it,
but
there’s
certainly
cases
which
do
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
we
think
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
before
this
court.
that
the
court
has
never
ruled
with
regard
to
whether
a
court
may
take
other
controversies
into
its
orbit,
when
it
is
efficient
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
state
law
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
state
law.
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
there
is
a
--
in
the
pleadings,
i
mention
some
federal
claims
basically
it’s
a
state
law.
and
riparian
rights,
lawsuits.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
millers
on
one
side
of
the
lake
and
the
landowners
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
there
is
a
state
line
in
between
them.
there
are
various
reasons
in
the
law
that
we
have
made
election
to
proceed
on
this,
i
think
there
is
possibility
for
federal
jurisdiction
independent
of
that.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
plant
was
closed
several
months
after
the
initiation
of
this
lawsuit.
it
was
--
the
sludge
bed
which
is
still
affecting
the
landowners
is
still
present,
and
that
there’s
much
litigation
whether
that
should
be
removed
or
not
removed
or
how
to
be
disposed
of.
but
the
effects
of
the
pollution
are
still
very
much
in
effect.
one
of
the
two
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
you
maybe
sir,
i’m
not
familiar
with
that
question.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
complaint
that
we
have
drawn
in
this
case
alleges
three
basic
counts,
it
states
a
factual
pattern.
we
were
the
--
class
action
of
the
case
was
dismissed
at
a
very
early
stage.
the
law
of
the
case
is
not
yet
been
fully
developed.
there
is
an
allegation
of
federal
violation
in
the
complaint.
but
basically,
the
count
sound
in
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
vermont
rather
than
any
federal
state
statutory
law.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
this
is
correct,
we
stated
under
the
civil
rules,
a
complaint
stating
a
factual
basis,
which
we
believe
calls
for
relief.
we
believe
we’re
entitled
to
relief
under
the
diversity
and
state
argument.
we
also
believe
they
may
well
develop
a
federal
concept
out
of
that,
but
to
be
quite
candid,
we
have
not
developed
that
question
because
of
the
jurisdictional
point
yet.
and
we
certainly
that
would
--
at
least
with
the
court.
as
the
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
that’s
right.
our
complaint
alleges
diversity
is
based
on
diversity
sections.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
think
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
responding
to
the
ben-hur
situation.
we
think
that
is
still
the
good
law
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
complete
diversity
where
the
case
and
controversy.
the
case
before
the
court,
there
is
full
diversity,
and
ancillary
pendent
matters
can
come
before
the
court.
we
fail
to
see
how
the
diversity
requirement
should
be
differently
treated
than
the
amounting
controversy.
the
effect
of
this
case
if
it
is
not
--
i
should
point
out
one
more
thing
too
and
that
is
there
is
big
body
of
case
law
which
in
the
question
of
intervention
is
a
matter
of
right
under
2482,
indicates
that
there’s
not
a
need
for
independent
jurisdictional
amount
where
the
first
case
has.
and,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
--
the
problems
would
come
about
if
this
court
does
not
recognize
that
where
in
the
efficient
cause
of
the
administration
of
justice,
you
got
have
this
finding
first,
that
a
court
is
prohibited
from
taking
jurisdiction
over
a
class.
not
only
does
it
destroy
the
class
action
concept
wherever
there
is
a
federal
question
requiring
an
amount
in
controversy,
or
a
diversity
question
involving
the
amount
in
controversy.
but
it
has
effects
on
the
question
of
the
development
of
the
concept
of
pendent
or
ancillary
jurisdiction.
it
has
the
effect
on
the
law
involving
intervention
of
right,
and
i
don’t
see
how
logically
one
can
say
that
can
take
jurisdiction
on
cases
which
don’t
need
jurisdictional
requirements
ancillary
in
certain
cases
and
not
on
others.
what
i’m
arguing
here
for
is
not
an
expansion
of
any
law
as
i
see
it
but
merely
an
application
of
law
to
those
cases
where
we
can
efficiently
put
this
in
to
the
hands
of
the
district
judge.
let
the
man
who
is
on
the
spot
make
the
decision
but
let’s
not
tie
his
hands,
let’s
not
force
this
into
several
pieces
of
litigation.
let’s
not
force
this
on
the
state
courts,
three
pieces,
we
have
six
cases
in
the
vermont
district
court,
that
we
have
enjoined
the
problem,
that’s
just
as
difficult
to
try.
the
district
class
action
case
influences
on
the
damages
question.
he
is
a
master.
if
you
do
things,
you
can
deal
with
what
is
really
a
major
problem.
a
serious
pollution
situation
in
the
most
inefficient,
intelligent
manner
before,
and
we
would
hate
to
see
that
court
prohibit
it
from
doing
so,
and
this
is
what
this
amounts
to.
we
would
suggest
that
the
arguments
of
the
defendant
in
this
matter
are
really
the
one
class
action
because
it
causes
problems
for
them
not
because
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
at
the
time
this
was
initiated.
there
was
no
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
well,
i
expect
that
if
that
were
filed
in
state
court,
we
might
have
removal
of
petition.
and,
we
are
faced
with
same
jurisdictional
question.
i
have
seen
another
cases
previously
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
at
that
point,
it
would
be.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
at
the
time
this
case
was
initiated,
there
was
no
state
class
action
proceeding.
there
was
a
proceeding
that
was
--
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
amended
subsequently
to
allow
it.
but
in
any
case,
whether
or
not,
the
congress
has
given
a
choice
on
diversity
both
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant.
the
question
is
not
--
whether
or
not
that
we
have
a
diversity
but
it’s
how
to
make
efficient
use,
and
to
prevent
any
more
litigation
than
is
necessary
given
the
diversity
situation
that
we
have
in
congress.
it
seems
to
me
in
conclusion
that
the
court
is
faced
with
two
choices
here.
a
most
restrictive
ruling
which
prohibits
the
district
judge
from
what
i
--
i
think
in
the
mathematical
sense,
prohibits
him
from
using
this
when
it’s
a
good
proof.
and,
there’s
nothing
here,
this
is
not
a
case
of
six
million
of
publication.
this
is
a
piece
of
real
litigation
before
the
courts
and
if
the
district
judge
and
that
we
are
asking
this
to
be
remanded
not
for
necessarily
a
class
action
for
the
termination
that
if
the
court
feels,
it
is
the
proper
tool
that
it
can
do
so,
and
it
is
not
prohibited
by
the
fact
that
one
or
more
persons
in
the
class
may
not
have
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount.
the
alternative
would
be
to
tie
the
hands
of
district
court
and
in
doing
so
i
think
bring
up
the
various
problems
i
have
mentioned,
thank
you.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
just
want
to
make
a
couple
of
comments
regarding
mr.
whipple’s
argument.
he
talks
about
causing
arised
in
the
federal
case
law.
if
i
read
the
mandate
of
23
(b)
(3)
right.
the
only
time
that
this
could
be
done
is
when
it
is
efficient
and
the
only
time
when
the
court
could
do
so
is
when
it
is
going
to
save
judicial
time
across
the
aspect.
and,
i
think
--
this
“parade
of
horribles”
which
was
suggested
by
mr.
whipple,
i
think
aren’t
true.
let
us
go
back
to
the
district
court,
i
don’t
want
to
argue
here,
we’re
going
have
a
mass
trial
of
240
people
or
the
merits
of
the
issue.
but
i’ll
say,
let
the
district
court
judge,
look
at
this
thing.
let
them
sit
by
on
the
issue,
and
make
a
decision,
how
am
i
going
to
handle
this
problem
involving
a
serious
number
of
people
who
are
affected
in
a
peculiar
way
by
acts.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor,
he
indicated
that
it
could
not
be
managed
if
he
had
to
separate
out
those
who
had
$10,000
and
those
who
didn’t.
you
got
to
have
to
try
the
damages
before
you
could
get
to
the
defendant
class,
but
his
opinion
said
with
great
reluctance.
he
dismissed
the
suit,
because
of
the
holdings
of
snyder
versus
harris,
and
so
i
think
we
should
really
leave
that
decision
in
the
hands
of
the
judge
who
is
going
to
have
to
make
that
decision
on
the
trial
court.
you
have
to
leave
that
one
way
or
another,
and,
if
we
lose
there,
i
think
that
takes
care
of
the
issue.
i
apologize
to
the
court,
i
not
recognize
a
name
of
illinois
versus
milwaukee,
that
case
was
decided
after
we
brought
this
and
i
am
familiar
with
the
case
but
i’m
not
quite
sure
as
mr.
whipple
knows
exactly
what
the
effects
of
the
common
law
of
the
federal
common
law
environmental
matters
on
water
waste,
how
this
would
affect
it?
in
any
case,
i
think
we
still
would
be
involved
in
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
it
would
make
the
pendent
concept
--
what
brings
the
pendent
situation
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
no,
there
would
be
--
would
be
with
the
with
the
state
ancillary
right
where
right
now,
we
have
to
go
into
the
pendent
in
part,
if
there
is
a
federal
claim
in
the
both
situation.
i
also
would
like
--
this
is
not
--
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
not
very
much,
i
think
we
should
all
hit
the
$10,000,
the
question
is
to
where.
these
are
other
efficiencies,
which
tie
into
this
type
of
thing.
the
efficiency
is
an
expert
time
--
the
efficiency’s
all
the
way
along
the
line
in
this
whole
environmental
field.
but
i
don’t
think
i
want
to
get
in
to
that
but
the
statement
that
this
sounds
in
nuisance
and
trespass
are
only
two
of
the
three
areas
which
it
sounds.
it
also
sounds
in
the
property
rights,
riparian
rights
of
joining
owners
on
a
lake,
or
of
not
at
this
really,
joining
but
owners
in
the
same
body
of
water.
and
we
think
that
if
ever
there
was
a
common
nucleus
of
fact,
this
is
it,
international
paper
company,
we
allege
has
done
one
thing.
and
it
has
continuously
done
this
thing
and
this
affects
a
large
number.
the
only
difference
here
would
be
the
question
of
damages
and
that
can
be
handled
we
suggest
in
a
multitude
of
worries
including
the
possibility
of
the
mass
sorting
amount.
and
we
don't
see
the
powers
of
the
mass
trial,
i
can
say
on
the
either
side
that
to
have
240
trials
on
the
issue
of
the
merits
frightens
me
a
great
deal
more
than
to
have
some
procedure
in
dealing
with
damages
on
a
common
set
of
facts.
the
comment
was
made
that
snyder
has
nothing
for
--
snyder,
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
did
not
come
into
snyder.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
snyder,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
begin
with.
that
was
not
a
case
that
was
going
forward
and
there
was
nothing
for
ancillary
to
hang
its
--
hang
on
to
tie
into.
and
i
would
not
have
been
gone
forward
in
the
courts
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
not
independent
jurisdiction
as
there
is
in
this
case.
and
i
might
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
may
very
well
have
a
class
here
or
there
maybe
other
classes
where
we
have
a
50
or
200,
250
with
only
one
or
two
claims.
and
to
prohibit
the
district
judge
as
a
jurisdictional
matter
from
going
forward
is
not
promoting
efficiency
as
suggested
by
my
opponent.
but
it
is
the
time
in
the
court’s
hands
for
using
it
in
a
proper
case.
i
am
not
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
this
matter
should
be
handled
as
a
class
action
unless
it
meets
the
text.
and
that
text
is
that
it
is
superior
to
other
matters,
other
ways
of
handling
this
as
an
efficient
way
in
the
controversy.
the
very
rule
of
23
(b)
(3)
itself,
if
it
doesn’t
meet
that,
we’re
out,
and
if
we
do
meet
that,
i
would
hate
to
see
the
district
court
judge
forced
at
a
jurisdictional
question
to
make
it
a
less
efficient
approach.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
no,
i
don’t,
your
honor,
i
think
if
we
went
back
with
some
of
the
amendment
rules,
which
might
be
appropriate
but
here,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
a
reason
on
this
one
and
i
think
that
this
is
where
we
are
here.
i
think
i
would
have
to
stand
on
that
position.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
the
federal
calendar
is
more
current
in
those
parts.
mr.
peter
f.
langrock
depending
upon
the
counties
but
for
the
most
part,
the
federal
courts
--
the
federal
courts
is
as
current
as
any
state
court
calendar,
and
there
are
some
state
court
calendars
which
are
substantial
behind
the
federal
court
calendar.
