mr.
taggart
whipple
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
divide
my
argument
as
follows.
i’d
like
to
make
a
few
comments
about
mr.
langrock’s
statements,
some
of
the
questions
that
were
asked,
and
then
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
principle
question
which
it
seems
to
me,
plaintiff
counsel
argument
didn’t
address
itself
to
directly.
and
that
is
this,
although
the
plaintiff
stressed
the
environmental
aspects
of
this
case,
the
legal
question
presented
by
this
case
consents
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
courts
which
have
been
limited
since
the
beginning
of
this
country
in
their
jurisdiction
was
so
designed
by
congress
and
have
been
so
construed,
and
limited
by
the
constitution
in
congress
in
1789.
indeed,
the
first
bill
introduced
it
the
senate
of
this
country
ended
up
as
judiciary
act
of
1789,
with
a
jurisdiction
limit
to
$500,
and
i
submit
we
must
never
forget,
in
this
case
or
elsewhere
that
the
federal
court
system
is
a
system
for
a
limited
purpose.
in
every
demand
like
this
made
on
the
federal
courts
has
to
be
carefully
examined
by
lawyers,
by
the
courts,
by
congress,
and
the
public
to
see
whether
it’s
consistent
with
the
ever
mounting
federal
case
law
which
engulfs
the
federal
courts.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
reasons
why
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
in
holding
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
class
action.
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
put
his
finger
on
the
cardinal
of
points.
sir,
when
you
said
that
in
order
to
overrule
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
the
opinion
of
judge
leddy,
this
court
must
confront
clark
against
gray
and
overrule
it.
i
think
that’s
clear
and
i
think
that’s
particularly
so
because
of
the
interpretation
put
upon
clark
against
gray
and
whether
you
decide
that
this
plaintiff’s
counsel
said
before
the
federal
rule
23
was
amended
in
1966.
but
the
interpretation
put
upon
clark
against
gray
and
snyder
against
harris
was
thereafter
rule
23
was
amended.
i
also
like
to
talk
about
ancillary
jurisdiction
and
the
reasons
why
ancillary
or
pendent
jurisdiction
superficially
in
appealing
idea
here.
and
in
my
judgment,
badly
misinterpreted
by
the
dissenting
judge
below.
the
reasons
why
an
ancillary
or
pendent
jurisdiction
if
applied
to
a
spurious
class
action
where
the
separate
and
distinct
claims
not
a
unitary
constitutional
case
or
controversy,
separate
claims
and
people
who
fall
short
of
the
jurisdictional
requirement
would
contravene
constitutional
statutory,
decisional
and
policy
considerations.
now,
i
covered
comments
statements
by
the
plaintiff’s
counsel.
he
said,
as
i
understood
him
that
the
so
called
sludge
bed
still
shows
that
the
effects
of
pollution
are
very
much
in
the
effect.
this
is
wrong.
in
the
case
brought
by
state
from
moore
against
new
york
and
(inaudible)
which
is
now
on
trial
before
a
special
master
(inaudible)
we
have
a
record
of
14,000
pages,
we
have
hundreds
of
exhibits,
thousands
of
pages.
and
in
that
case,
i
have
cross-examined
witnesses
who
have
said
--
one
of
them
who
spend
his
life
from
the
river
and
sails
over
the
waters
of
the
sludge
bed.
i
asked
him,
what
is
the
water
like?
he
said,
beautiful.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no
sir,
but
i
do
not
want
to
stand
here
and
permit
the
statement
to
go
unchallenged.
mr.
taggart
whipple
but,
i
simply
didn’t
want
that
to
go
about,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
basis
for
the
jurisdiction,
federal
jurisdiction.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
keep
claiming
that
from
the
beginning
of
time,
congress
has
had
the
task
of
describing
limitations
on
this
diversity
jurisdiction.
congress
has
repeatedly
reenacted
the
phrase
matter
in
dispute,
originally
in
1789,
a
matter
in
controversy
as
it
is
now.
the
courts
have
held
that
this
phrase
must
be
strictly
construed,
the
policy
of
the
statute
calls
for
its
strict
construction.
we
say
that
it
holds
is
good
now,
just
the
way
it’s
held
good
from
the
beginning
of
time
here.
and
that
cases
was
smaller
amount
for
the
state
courts.
indeed
the
diversity
statute
1332a
constitutes
as
the
court
said
in
heely
and
represents
a
demonstration
of
a
delicate
balance
between
federal
and
state
powers.
the
federal
court
should
not
be
looked
upon
as
a
reservoir
for
all
litigation,
but
rather
in
diversity
cases,
only
those
cases
which
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and,
the
jurisdictional
amount
towards
this
court
knows
as
applies
in
cases
arising
under
the
laws.
the
treaties
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
section
1331
(a).
snyder
in
1969,
the
recent
case
applied
this
principle.
it
rejected
aggregation,
despite
the
claims
of
the
plaintiffs
and
the
sentence
in
that
case
that
this
reduction
of
aggregation
would
undercut
and
undermined.
those
words
that
are
used
in
majority
in
dissenting
opinion.
undercut
and
undermine,
the
amendments
to
rule
23.
the
court
pointed
out
that
a
spurious
class
action
is
a
kind
of
a
permissive
joinder
device
of
separate
and
distinct
claims.
and
in
that
situation,
each
plaintiff
to
where
it’s
separate
and
distinct
claim
must
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
they
pointed
out
that
the
non-aggregation
doctrine
was
not
based
on
old
rule
23
or
any
rule
or
procedure,
rather
it
is
based
under
court’s
consistent
interpretation
of
the
phrase
matter
and
controversy,
which
predates
even
the
federal
rules
of
procedure
amendments
in
1938,
that
the
court
has
held
its
consistent
interpretation
for
years.
and
that
congress
in
four
times
raising
the
jurisdictional
amount,
starting
in
1789,
has
reenacted
the
the
phrase
master
in
controversy
for
year
and
years
in
a
lot
of
these
interpretations.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
assume
it
will
in
the
federal
court,
your
honor.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
recognize,
your
honor,
you
did
not
and
i’ve
read
your
dissent
carefully
and
at
the
same
time
i
have
noted
with
all
respect
that
in
your
dissent,
you
and
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out,
that
the
majority
rule
would
apply
to
a
case
just
like
this
where
one
or
more
plaintiffs
did
into
the
jurisdictional
amount
and
the
others
did
not.
mr.
taggart
whipple
whatever
the
reason,
your
honor,
i
have
noted
that
and
i
have
noted
that
in
two
cases
cited
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
snyder
clark
against
gray,
and
the
court
of
appeal
decision
in
alvarez.
in
each
of
those
cases,
one
plaintiff
satisfied
the
jurisdictional
amount,
and
i
can’t
see
really
logically
any
difference.
the
tool,
i
think
it
is
true
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
saw
a
persuasive
internal
evidence
from
the
snyder
opinion
that
the
rule
there
admittedly
in
snyder,
there
were
no
plaintiff
with
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount,
but
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
read
carefully,
the
majority
opinion
in
snyder
covered
the
situation
before
your
honors
now.
and
that
is
where
we
have
four
named
plaintiffs
(inaudible)
jurisdictional
amount
and
none
--
according
to
the
complaint,
none
of
the
unnamed
plaintiffs
meet
that
amount.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
have
indeed,
your
honor.
i’d
be
glad
to
answer
questions
about
it.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
start
with
a
proposition,
your
honor
in
answer
to
your
question
that
the
complaint
itself
rests
solely
and
entirely
on
1332
(a)
which
is
diversity.
i
listened
to
mr.
langrock
carefully
and
i
heard
him
say
that
they’re
receding
in
the
complaint
state
law
of
claims.
now,
i
think
that’s
evident,
this
is
not
a
case
arising
under
1331
(a)
which
i
think
as
you
know.
mr.
taggart
whipple
your
honor,
i
see
the
differences
between
illinois
against
milwaukee
on
the
one
hand
on
this
case
on
the
other.
in
our
claim,
milwaukee
was
enacting
to
abate,
a
public
instance
of
large
measure.
this
is
an
action
for
money
damages,
each
and
every
one
of
the
four
plaintiffs
and
each
and
everyone
of
the
200
(inaudible)
is
the
money
of
the
class.
simply
from
money
damage,
they’re
not
trying
to
abate.
if
they
wanted
to
abate,
they
have
other
remedies.
indeed,
under
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
of
1972,
a
citizen
suits
of
large
measure
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor,
when
the
original
suit,
the
fundamental
prayers
to
removal
--
removal
of
the
sludge
bed.
mr.
taggart
whipple
by
your
ruling,
i
gather
it
is
in
illinois
against
milwaukee.
but
in
this
case
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
i
don’t
think
it
necessarily
applies
in
the
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
in
the
original
action,
the
question
is
to
whether
the
bed
water
be
removed
is
now
before
the
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
trust
of
your
ruling
in
illinois
against
milwaukee
is
to
visit
the
remarks
you
made
on
actions
brought
by
a
state.
it
says
nothing
about
actions
brought
by
private
people,
action
brought
by
a
state
to
abate.
mr.
taggart
whipple
none,
whatever
your
honor.
indeed,
at
one
point
in
the
milwaukee,
one
of
the
other
cases,
the
court
indicates
that
you
would
be
slow
to
apply
this
doctrine
to
private
claims.
illinois
against
milwaukee
also
adopted
the
language
of
texas
against
pankey,
where
the
judge
there
spoke
of
the
state’s
right,
a
quasi-sovereign
right
in
ecological
period.
that’s
not
this
case.
this
is
a
strict
common
law,
border
play
case
for
money
damages
based
on
it.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
i
don’t
think
it
would,
in
either
case,
suppose
it
is
based
on
federal
common
law,
then
you’re
in
1331
(a)
and
you’ve
got
the
$10,000.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
i
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference
and
i’ll
be
glad
to
talk
about
that
argument
right
now.
as
far
as
ancillary
jurisdiction
goes,
my
first
point
is
that
when
snyder
was
decided,
in
all
the
chain
of
cases
that
snyder
adopted,
ancillary
jurisdiction
was
brought
in
our
brief
point
as
it
goes
back
to
at
least
1824.
and
we
submit
that
this
court
over
the
years
in
applying
that
the
thinking
that
led
to
snyder
implicitly
rejected
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction.
but
i
don’t
have
to
rely
on
implicit
rejection.
i
rely
upon
a
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
and
i
can’t
find
that
the
matter
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
was
ever
presented
in
snyder,
i
want
to
be
frank
about
that.
but
in
the
cases
where
it
has
been
presented,
i
think
that
way
the
law
has
developed,
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
the
courts
have
explicitly
refused
to
exercise
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
permissive
joinder
of
separate
and
distinct
claims.
and
in
snyder,
the
court
pointed
out
that
a
class
action
is
kind
of
admissive
joinder
device
where
the
particular
scope
is
not
directed
at
a
risk
or
a
corpus.
and
this
is
not
having
to
do
with
disputed
title
in
real
property
or
conflicting
claims,
some
kind
of
a
fund
or
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
court.
my
analysis
to
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
cases
suggest,
and
i
think
the
law
will
support
me
on
this
that
this
is
a
permissible
procedure
only
where
there
is
a
unitary
constitutional
case
or
a
controversy,
and
that’s
not
this
case.
this
is
a
bundle
of
more
than
200
separate
and
distinct
claims,
and
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
at
the
end
of
page
45
or
so.
a
half
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
issues
that
are
going
to
be
raised
by
each
and
everyone
of
these
200
people
when
they
come
to
trial.
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
order
to
be
applicable,
it
seems
to
me
from
the
cases
must
have
a
direct
relation
to
a
property
or
assets
in
the
court’s
possession
or
control.
that’s
not
the
case
here,
it
also
has
been
expanded
getting
away
from
court
against
(inaudible)
to
include
compulsory
counter
claims
or
claims
of
a
nature
that
would
be
precluded
if
not
raised
in
the
principal
action.
and
this
is
not
that
case,
these
200
unnamed
plaintiff
claims
are
not
going
to
be
precluded
by
any
judgment
with
respect
to
the
(inaudible).
i
don’t
find
any
decisions
cited
by
the
plaintiffs
or
any
decisions
cited
in
the
dissent,
which
is
precedent
for
the
use
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
a
spurious
class
action.
the
case
is
a
limited
as
i
said
before
to
unitary
constitutional
cases
or
controversy.
and
to
expand
that
limited
doctrine,
and
it
is
a
doctrine
of
limitation
to
sweep
in
200
separate
and
distinct
claims
with
200
separate
distinct
trials,
and
200
separate
and
distinct
juries,
that’s
what
is
going
to
be.
where
you
are
going
to
have
a
mass
trial
with
200
odd
people
before
the
court,
and
one
jury
is
going
to
be
out
to
segregate
out
each
of
the
considerations
involving
each
of
the
plaintiffs.
i
submit
to
sweep
in
these
200
claims
under
a
loose
application
of
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
which
the
dissent
of
the
law
would
do
flies
right
in
the
face
of
the
subtle
principles
about
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
i
talked
about
a
moment
ago.
pendent
jurisdiction
also
is
involved
here,
although
the
term
“props”
was
used
rather
loosely
and
intermixed
with
the
ancillary
by
the
judge
below.
pendent
and
the
court
had
an
occasion
to
look
at
this
very
recently
in
the
moor
v.
county
of
alameda
case,
not
cited
in
my
brief
because
it
came
out
so
recently.
pendent
jurisdiction
is
a
specialized
form
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
and
it
really
involves
as
the
court
knows,
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction
over
a
state
law
of
claim,
which
is
pendent
to
a
federal
claim
where
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
there
would
not
be
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
on
your
assumption
there
would
no
state
claim
to
scotch
tape
on
to
the
federal
claim.
but
i
also
point
out
in
pendent
jurisdiction,
if
we’re
correct
in
saying
state
law
applies
that
the
cases
have
involved
federal
and
state
claims
by
the
same
party,
or
the
same
party,
which
is
not
the
case
here
at
all.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
the
complaint
doesn’t
say
that,
your
honor
but
if
you
--
taking
your
assumption,
let’s
take
that
for
the
moment.
let’s
say,
this
is
a
1331
case,
it
wasn’t
a
1332
case,
and
that
each
of
these
200
odd
plaintiffs
says
a
state
law
of
claim
and
the
federal
law
claim,
in
the
argument
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
think
it
was.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor
but
because
the
complaint
does
coach
the
claim
under
state
law,
which
is
the
necessary
result
of
using
1332
(a)
diversity
suit,
i
felt
i
had
to
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
sir.
if
i
may
so,
and
the
reason
you
wouldn’t
is
that
there
is
not
a
unitary
case
of
controversy.
there
are
more
than
200
separate
and
distinct
claims.
now,
the
cases
as
i
read
them
in
pendent
jurisdiction
--
i
am
referring
the
united
mine
workers
against
gibbs
and
the
recent
opinion
of
this
court
last
spring
in
moor
v.
county
of
alameda
make
this
very
claim
that
has
to
be
as
you’ve
said,
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
fact.
there
isn’t
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
fact.
each
and
everyone
of
these
plaintiffs
is
going
to
have
to
rest
his
claim
on
separate
considerations.
looking
at
the
record
itself,
the
zahns
on
more
than
half
a
mile
of
the
shore
front.
there
the
record
doesn't
show
but
they
are
four
miles
away
from
this
plant.
the
leasers
and
they
run
an
(inaudible)
the
leasers
own
1800
feet
at
shore
front,
they’re
a
mile
from
the
plant,
they
run
in
a
mariner.
if
you
look
at
the
spectrum
of
these
people
up
and
down
the
20
miles
of
vermont
shore
front,
they’re
all
in
different
situations.
mr.
taggart
whipple
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
think
the
zahns
might.
i
think
the
zahns
might,
your
honor,
but
the
thrust
of
the
dissent
as
you
know,
in
the
plaintiff’s
argument
here
is
that
pendent
jurisdiction
is
enough
to
sweep
in
the
200
other
people.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
want
to
make
a
claim
that
i’m
to
trying
to
restrict
gibbs
or
moor
because
i
think
that
in
addition
to
the
holding,
that
there
has
to
be
unitary
case
of
controversy,
gibbs
also
it
seems
to
me,
extends
pendent
jurisdiction,
and
moor
does
too
to
a
situations
where
the
litigation
of
the
principle
claim
might
well
have
a
preclusive
effect
on
the
dependent
claim,
but
then
again
that
isn’t
this
case
here
because
the
litigation
of
the
zahn
and
leasers’
claim
isn’t
going
to
preclude,
these
are
the
200
people
in
trying
their
cases
wherever
they
may
try
them.
now,
the
plaintiffs
have
bottom
cases
in
their
brief
which
they
claim
slide
away
from
the
principles
of
gibbs
and
moor
as
i
interpret
them.
we
said
in
our
brief
that
substantially,
all
of
those
cases
involve
the
unitary
case
of
controversy.
since
our
brief
was
written,
i
have
read
the
court’s
opinion
in
moor
in
a
footnote
29411
u.s.
of
page
713
substantially
all
of
the
cases,
right
on
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
respect
to
categorize
by
this
court
as
involving
a
unitary
case
of
controversy,
just
what
we
said
on
our
brief.
i
think
that
distinguishes
those
cases
from
our
situation.
now,
even
if
the
power
to
hear
exists
here
with
respect
to
pendent
jurisdictions
still
the
court
pointed
out
in
moor,
that
that
doctrine,
the
pendent
jurisdiction
involves
consideration
for
judicial
economy,
inconvenience,
and
fairness.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
sweeping
in
these
200
people
with
200
separate
and
distinct
claims
runs
a
180
degrees
away
from
consideration
to
judicial
economy
and
fairness
of
convenience.
these
cases
which
are
sought
to
be
swept
in
here
on
the
class
action
belonging
to
state
courts.
there
is
as
plaintiff's
counsel
pointed
out,
a
vermont
class
action
statute,
it’s
a
chinese
copy
of
federal
rule
23,
it
was
passed
in
july
71,
a
couple
of
months,
a
few
months
after
this
complaint
was
brought.
my
client
is
suable
in
this
court,
in
the
state
courts
of
vermont.
there’s
no
jurisdictional
bar
with
respect
to
vermont
class
action
statute
because
according
to
my
reading
of
vermont
law,
the
county
courts
have
cases
involving
$200
a
year.
so,
this
isn’t
the
case,
for
the
unnamed
plaintiffs
are
going
to
be
debarred
from
suing
in
an
appropriate
forum.
they
have
their
forum,
it’s
available,
we
can
be
sued
there.
one
final
observation,
basically
as
plaintiff's
counsels
said,
this
case
involves
claims
of
nuisance
and
trespass
whether
under
the
federal
rubric
or
the
state
rubric,
and
because
that’s
so,
we
will
have
a
situation
which
is
mass
tort,
and
i
remind
this
court
that
the
notes
to
the
advisory
committee
with
respect
to
the
change
in
rule
23
said
that
ordinarily,
class
action
treatment
would
not
be
appropriate
to
mass
tort
situations.
and
even
if
the
text
writers
who
are
in
favor
of
class
actions
have
come
down
on
that
for
the
same
reason
and
the
reasons
are
just
those
i
mentioned
that
each
and
everyone
of
these
plaintiffs
is
going
to
have
to
present
a
set
of
different
facts
of
the
court.
and
this
certainly
would
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
rule
23
that
common
factual
(inaudible)
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
as
far
as
federal
law
goes.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
in
either
event,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plaintiffs
would
be
met
by
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount.
and
i
don’t
think
that
you
get
a
different
rule
for
a
different
result
for
that
reason.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
agree,
your
honor.
the
fundamental
case,
the
threshold
hurdle
is
whether
the
limit
to
the
jurisdiction,
that
is
always
applied
to
the
federal
district
court
is
here
as
going
to
be
disregarded
when
we
sweep
in
these
200
class
people,
none
of
whom,
according
to
the
complaint
have
a
jurisdictional
claim
rule
over
$10,000.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
do,
your
honor
because
if
it’s
federal
law
then
1331
(a)
governs
which
speaks
of
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
of
the
law
as
to
the
united
states
and
that
has
a
$10,000
jurisdictional
limitation
in
it.
and
the
reason
for
the
$10,000
limit
there
is
just
the
same
as
it
is
in
1332
(a)
namely,
to
try
to
stable
up
and
to
prevent
the
ever
mounting
case
load.
mr.
taggart
whipple
on
your
assumption,
the
federal
common
law
would
govern,
then
i
think
the
state
courts
would
apply
federal
common
law.
and
i
argued
this
before,
your
honor
in
the
original
case
where
you
directed
this
to
argue
federal
common
or
a
state
common
law,
and
it
seems
to
me
there
would
be
no
difficulty
there
because
as
i
understand
it
in
trying
to
evolve
a
federal
common
law,
the
courts
look
to
a
variety
of
sources
including
relevant
state
law.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
think
so,
i
think
that’s
the
clear
teaching
of
milwaukee
and
other
cases,
but
i
don’t
want
you
to
believe
that
i’m
conceding
that
federal
common
law
governs
here
or
not.
in
summary,
from
the
standpoint
of
discretion
of
power,
this
is
my
closing
summary,
your
honor.
ancillary
or
pendent
jurisdiction
is
improper
here
because
it
would
impermissibly
expand
contrary
to
rule
82,
the
limited
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts,
it
would
multiply,
i
think
in
geometrical
proportions,
the
rising
case
out
of
the
federal
courts,
it
would
--
finally,
contrary
to
the
principles
enunciated
in
gibbs
and
moore,
and
the
principle
spelled
out
in
snyder,
and
it
would
be
contrary
to
congressional
purpose
underlying
the
$10,000
limitation.
i
may
save
some
time
if
necessary
to
comment
on
mr.
langrock’s
rebuttal.
mr.
taggart
whipple
there
wouldn’t
be
any
state
claim
to
be
pendent.
mr.
taggart
whipple
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
divide
my
argument
as
follows.
i’d
like
to
make
a
few
comments
about
mr.
langrock’s
statements,
some
of
the
questions
that
were
asked,
and
then
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
principle
question
which
it
seems
to
me,
plaintiff
counsel
argument
didn’t
address
itself
to
directly.
and
that
is
this,
although
the
plaintiff
stressed
the
environmental
aspects
of
this
case,
the
legal
question
presented
by
this
case
consents
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
courts
which
have
been
limited
since
the
beginning
of
this
country
in
their
jurisdiction
was
so
designed
by
congress
and
have
been
so
construed,
and
limited
by
the
constitution
in
congress
in
1789.
indeed,
the
first
bill
introduced
it
the
senate
of
this
country
ended
up
as
judiciary
act
of
1789,
with
a
jurisdiction
limit
to
$500,
and
i
submit
we
must
never
forget,
in
this
case
or
elsewhere
that
the
federal
court
system
is
a
system
for
a
limited
purpose.
in
every
demand
like
this
made
on
the
federal
courts
has
to
be
carefully
examined
by
lawyers,
by
the
courts,
by
congress,
and
the
public
to
see
whether
it’s
consistent
with
the
ever
mounting
federal
case
law
which
engulfs
the
federal
courts.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
reasons
why
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
in
holding
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
class
action.
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
put
his
finger
on
the
cardinal
of
points.
sir,
when
you
said
that
in
order
to
overrule
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
the
opinion
of
judge
leddy,
this
court
must
confront
clark
against
gray
and
overrule
it.
i
think
that’s
clear
and
i
think
that’s
particularly
so
because
of
the
interpretation
put
upon
clark
against
gray
and
whether
you
decide
that
this
plaintiff’s
counsel
said
before
the
federal
rule
23
was
amended
in
1966.
but
the
interpretation
put
upon
clark
against
gray
and
snyder
against
harris
was
thereafter
rule
23
was
amended.
i
also
like
to
talk
about
ancillary
jurisdiction
and
the
reasons
why
ancillary
or
pendent
jurisdiction
superficially
in
appealing
idea
here.
and
in
my
judgment,
badly
misinterpreted
by
the
dissenting
judge
below.
the
reasons
why
an
ancillary
or
pendent
jurisdiction
if
applied
to
a
spurious
class
action
where
the
separate
and
distinct
claims
not
a
unitary
constitutional
case
or
controversy,
separate
claims
and
people
who
fall
short
of
the
jurisdictional
requirement
would
contravene
constitutional
statutory,
decisional
and
policy
considerations.
now,
i
covered
comments
statements
by
the
plaintiff’s
counsel.
he
said,
as
i
understood
him
that
the
so
called
sludge
bed
still
shows
that
the
effects
of
pollution
are
very
much
in
the
effect.
this
is
wrong.
in
the
case
brought
by
state
from
moore
against
new
york
and
(inaudible)
which
is
now
on
trial
before
a
special
master
(inaudible)
we
have
a
record
of
14,000
pages,
we
have
hundreds
of
exhibits,
thousands
of
pages.
and
in
that
case,
i
have
cross-examined
witnesses
who
have
said
--
one
of
them
who
spend
his
life
from
the
river
and
sails
over
the
waters
of
the
sludge
bed.
i
asked
him,
what
is
the
water
like?
he
said,
beautiful.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no
sir,
but
i
do
not
want
to
stand
here
and
permit
the
statement
to
go
unchallenged.
mr.
taggart
whipple
but,
i
simply
didn’t
want
that
to
go
about,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
basis
for
the
jurisdiction,
federal
jurisdiction.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
keep
claiming
that
from
the
beginning
of
time,
congress
has
had
the
task
of
describing
limitations
on
this
diversity
jurisdiction.
congress
has
repeatedly
reenacted
the
phrase
matter
in
dispute,
originally
in
1789,
a
matter
in
controversy
as
it
is
now.
the
courts
have
held
that
this
phrase
must
be
strictly
construed,
the
policy
of
the
statute
calls
for
its
strict
construction.
we
say
that
it
holds
is
good
now,
just
the
way
it’s
held
good
from
the
beginning
of
time
here.
and
that
cases
was
smaller
amount
for
the
state
courts.
indeed
the
diversity
statute
1332a
constitutes
as
the
court
said
in
heely
and
represents
a
demonstration
of
a
delicate
balance
between
federal
and
state
powers.
the
federal
court
should
not
be
looked
upon
as
a
reservoir
for
all
litigation,
but
rather
in
diversity
cases,
only
those
cases
which
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and,
the
jurisdictional
amount
towards
this
court
knows
as
applies
in
cases
arising
under
the
laws.
the
treaties
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
section
1331
(a).
snyder
in
1969,
the
recent
case
applied
this
principle.
it
rejected
aggregation,
despite
the
claims
of
the
plaintiffs
and
the
sentence
in
that
case
that
this
reduction
of
aggregation
would
undercut
and
undermined.
those
words
that
are
used
in
majority
in
dissenting
opinion.
undercut
and
undermine,
the
amendments
to
rule
23.
the
court
pointed
out
that
a
spurious
class
action
is
a
kind
of
a
permissive
joinder
device
of
separate
and
distinct
claims.
and
in
that
situation,
each
plaintiff
to
where
it’s
separate
and
distinct
claim
must
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
they
pointed
out
that
the
non-aggregation
doctrine
was
not
based
on
old
rule
23
or
any
rule
or
procedure,
rather
it
is
based
under
court’s
consistent
interpretation
of
the
phrase
matter
and
controversy,
which
predates
even
the
federal
rules
of
procedure
amendments
in
1938,
that
the
court
has
held
its
consistent
interpretation
for
years.
and
that
congress
in
four
times
raising
the
jurisdictional
amount,
starting
in
1789,
has
reenacted
the
the
phrase
master
in
controversy
for
year
and
years
in
a
lot
of
these
interpretations.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
assume
it
will
in
the
federal
court,
your
honor.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
recognize,
your
honor,
you
did
not
and
i’ve
read
your
dissent
carefully
and
at
the
same
time
i
have
noted
with
all
respect
that
in
your
dissent,
you
and
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out,
that
the
majority
rule
would
apply
to
a
case
just
like
this
where
one
or
more
plaintiffs
did
into
the
jurisdictional
amount
and
the
others
did
not.
mr.
taggart
whipple
whatever
the
reason,
your
honor,
i
have
noted
that
and
i
have
noted
that
in
two
cases
cited
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
snyder
clark
against
gray,
and
the
court
of
appeal
decision
in
alvarez.
in
each
of
those
cases,
one
plaintiff
satisfied
the
jurisdictional
amount,
and
i
can’t
see
really
logically
any
difference.
the
tool,
i
think
it
is
true
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
saw
a
persuasive
internal
evidence
from
the
snyder
opinion
that
the
rule
there
admittedly
in
snyder,
there
were
no
plaintiff
with
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount,
but
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
read
carefully,
the
majority
opinion
in
snyder
covered
the
situation
before
your
honors
now.
and
that
is
where
we
have
four
named
plaintiffs
(inaudible)
jurisdictional
amount
and
none
--
according
to
the
complaint,
none
of
the
unnamed
plaintiffs
meet
that
amount.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
have
indeed,
your
honor.
i’d
be
glad
to
answer
questions
about
it.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
start
with
a
proposition,
your
honor
in
answer
to
your
question
that
the
complaint
itself
rests
solely
and
entirely
on
1332
(a)
which
is
diversity.
i
listened
to
mr.
langrock
carefully
and
i
heard
him
say
that
they’re
receding
in
the
complaint
state
law
of
claims.
now,
i
think
that’s
evident,
this
is
not
a
case
arising
under
1331
(a)
which
i
think
as
you
know.
mr.
taggart
whipple
your
honor,
i
see
the
differences
between
illinois
against
milwaukee
on
the
one
hand
on
this
case
on
the
other.
in
our
claim,
milwaukee
was
enacting
to
abate,
a
public
instance
of
large
measure.
this
is
an
action
for
money
damages,
each
and
every
one
of
the
four
plaintiffs
and
each
and
everyone
of
the
200
(inaudible)
is
the
money
of
the
class.
simply
from
money
damage,
they’re
not
trying
to
abate.
if
they
wanted
to
abate,
they
have
other
remedies.
indeed,
under
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
of
1972,
a
citizen
suits
of
large
measure
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
don’t
think
so,
your
honor,
when
the
original
suit,
the
fundamental
prayers
to
removal
--
removal
of
the
sludge
bed.
mr.
taggart
whipple
by
your
ruling,
i
gather
it
is
in
illinois
against
milwaukee.
but
in
this
case
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
i
don’t
think
it
necessarily
applies
in
the
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
in
the
original
action,
the
question
is
to
whether
the
bed
water
be
removed
is
now
before
the
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
trust
of
your
ruling
in
illinois
against
milwaukee
is
to
visit
the
remarks
you
made
on
actions
brought
by
a
state.
it
says
nothing
about
actions
brought
by
private
people,
action
brought
by
a
state
to
abate.
mr.
taggart
whipple
none,
whatever
your
honor.
indeed,
at
one
point
in
the
milwaukee,
one
of
the
other
cases,
the
court
indicates
that
you
would
be
slow
to
apply
this
doctrine
to
private
claims.
illinois
against
milwaukee
also
adopted
the
language
of
texas
against
pankey,
where
the
judge
there
spoke
of
the
state’s
right,
a
quasi-sovereign
right
in
ecological
period.
that’s
not
this
case.
this
is
a
strict
common
law,
border
play
case
for
money
damages
based
on
it.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
i
don’t
think
it
would,
in
either
case,
suppose
it
is
based
on
federal
common
law,
then
you’re
in
1331
(a)
and
you’ve
got
the
$10,000.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
i
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference
and
i’ll
be
glad
to
talk
about
that
argument
right
now.
as
far
as
ancillary
jurisdiction
goes,
my
first
point
is
that
when
snyder
was
decided,
in
all
the
chain
of
cases
that
snyder
adopted,
ancillary
jurisdiction
was
brought
in
our
brief
point
as
it
goes
back
to
at
least
1824.
and
we
submit
that
this
court
over
the
years
in
applying
that
the
thinking
that
led
to
snyder
implicitly
rejected
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction.
but
i
don’t
have
to
rely
on
implicit
rejection.
i
rely
upon
a
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
and
i
can’t
find
that
the
matter
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
was
ever
presented
in
snyder,
i
want
to
be
frank
about
that.
but
in
the
cases
where
it
has
been
presented,
i
think
that
way
the
law
has
developed,
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
the
courts
have
explicitly
refused
to
exercise
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
permissive
joinder
of
separate
and
distinct
claims.
and
in
snyder,
the
court
pointed
out
that
a
class
action
is
kind
of
admissive
joinder
device
where
the
particular
scope
is
not
directed
at
a
risk
or
a
corpus.
and
this
is
not
having
to
do
with
disputed
title
in
real
property
or
conflicting
claims,
some
kind
of
a
fund
or
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
court.
my
analysis
to
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
cases
suggest,
and
i
think
the
law
will
support
me
on
this
that
this
is
a
permissible
procedure
only
where
there
is
a
unitary
constitutional
case
or
a
controversy,
and
that’s
not
this
case.
this
is
a
bundle
of
more
than
200
separate
and
distinct
claims,
and
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
at
the
end
of
page
45
or
so.
a
half
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
issues
that
are
going
to
be
raised
by
each
and
everyone
of
these
200
people
when
they
come
to
trial.
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
order
to
be
applicable,
it
seems
to
me
from
the
cases
must
have
a
direct
relation
to
a
property
or
assets
in
the
court’s
possession
or
control.
that’s
not
the
case
here,
it
also
has
been
expanded
getting
away
from
court
against
(inaudible)
to
include
compulsory
counter
claims
or
claims
of
a
nature
that
would
be
precluded
if
not
raised
in
the
principal
action.
and
this
is
not
that
case,
these
200
unnamed
plaintiff
claims
are
not
going
to
be
precluded
by
any
judgment
with
respect
to
the
(inaudible).
i
don’t
find
any
decisions
cited
by
the
plaintiffs
or
any
decisions
cited
in
the
dissent,
which
is
precedent
for
the
use
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
a
spurious
class
action.
the
case
is
a
limited
as
i
said
before
to
unitary
constitutional
cases
or
controversy.
and
to
expand
that
limited
doctrine,
and
it
is
a
doctrine
of
limitation
to
sweep
in
200
separate
and
distinct
claims
with
200
separate
distinct
trials,
and
200
separate
and
distinct
juries,
that’s
what
is
going
to
be.
where
you
are
going
to
have
a
mass
trial
with
200
odd
people
before
the
court,
and
one
jury
is
going
to
be
out
to
segregate
out
each
of
the
considerations
involving
each
of
the
plaintiffs.
i
submit
to
sweep
in
these
200
claims
under
a
loose
application
of
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
which
the
dissent
of
the
law
would
do
flies
right
in
the
face
of
the
subtle
principles
about
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
i
talked
about
a
moment
ago.
pendent
jurisdiction
also
is
involved
here,
although
the
term
“props”
was
used
rather
loosely
and
intermixed
with
the
ancillary
by
the
judge
below.
pendent
and
the
court
had
an
occasion
to
look
at
this
very
recently
in
the
moor
v.
county
of
alameda
case,
not
cited
in
my
brief
because
it
came
out
so
recently.
pendent
jurisdiction
is
a
specialized
form
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
and
it
really
involves
as
the
court
knows,
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction
over
a
state
law
of
claim,
which
is
pendent
to
a
federal
claim
where
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
there
would
not
be
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
on
your
assumption
there
would
no
state
claim
to
scotch
tape
on
to
the
federal
claim.
but
i
also
point
out
in
pendent
jurisdiction,
if
we’re
correct
in
saying
state
law
applies
that
the
cases
have
involved
federal
and
state
claims
by
the
same
party,
or
the
same
party,
which
is
not
the
case
here
at
all.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
the
complaint
doesn’t
say
that,
your
honor
but
if
you
--
taking
your
assumption,
let’s
take
that
for
the
moment.
let’s
say,
this
is
a
1331
case,
it
wasn’t
a
1332
case,
and
that
each
of
these
200
odd
plaintiffs
says
a
state
law
of
claim
and
the
federal
law
claim,
in
the
argument
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
think
it
was.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor
but
because
the
complaint
does
coach
the
claim
under
state
law,
which
is
the
necessary
result
of
using
1332
(a)
diversity
suit,
i
felt
i
had
to
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
taggart
whipple
no,
sir.
if
i
may
so,
and
the
reason
you
wouldn’t
is
that
there
is
not
a
unitary
case
of
controversy.
there
are
more
than
200
separate
and
distinct
claims.
now,
the
cases
as
i
read
them
in
pendent
jurisdiction
--
i
am
referring
the
united
mine
workers
against
gibbs
and
the
recent
opinion
of
this
court
last
spring
in
moor
v.
county
of
alameda
make
this
very
claim
that
has
to
be
as
you’ve
said,
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
fact.
there
isn’t
a
common
nucleus
of
operative
fact.
each
and
everyone
of
these
plaintiffs
is
going
to
have
to
rest
his
claim
on
separate
considerations.
looking
at
the
record
itself,
the
zahns
on
more
than
half
a
mile
of
the
shore
front.
there
the
record
doesn't
show
but
they
are
four
miles
away
from
this
plant.
the
leasers
and
they
run
an
(inaudible)
the
leasers
own
1800
feet
at
shore
front,
they’re
a
mile
from
the
plant,
they
run
in
a
mariner.
if
you
look
at
the
spectrum
of
these
people
up
and
down
the
20
miles
of
vermont
shore
front,
they’re
all
in
different
situations.
mr.
taggart
whipple
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
think
the
zahns
might.
i
think
the
zahns
might,
your
honor,
but
the
thrust
of
the
dissent
as
you
know,
in
the
plaintiff’s
argument
here
is
that
pendent
jurisdiction
is
enough
to
sweep
in
the
200
other
people.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
want
to
make
a
claim
that
i’m
to
trying
to
restrict
gibbs
or
moor
because
i
think
that
in
addition
to
the
holding,
that
there
has
to
be
unitary
case
of
controversy,
gibbs
also
it
seems
to
me,
extends
pendent
jurisdiction,
and
moor
does
too
to
a
situations
where
the
litigation
of
the
principle
claim
might
well
have
a
preclusive
effect
on
the
dependent
claim,
but
then
again
that
isn’t
this
case
here
because
the
litigation
of
the
zahn
and
leasers’
claim
isn’t
going
to
preclude,
these
are
the
200
people
in
trying
their
cases
wherever
they
may
try
them.
now,
the
plaintiffs
have
bottom
cases
in
their
brief
which
they
claim
slide
away
from
the
principles
of
gibbs
and
moor
as
i
interpret
them.
we
said
in
our
brief
that
substantially,
all
of
those
cases
involve
the
unitary
case
of
controversy.
since
our
brief
was
written,
i
have
read
the
court’s
opinion
in
moor
in
a
footnote
29411
u.s.
of
page
713
substantially
all
of
the
cases,
right
on
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
respect
to
categorize
by
this
court
as
involving
a
unitary
case
of
controversy,
just
what
we
said
on
our
brief.
i
think
that
distinguishes
those
cases
from
our
situation.
now,
even
if
the
power
to
hear
exists
here
with
respect
to
pendent
jurisdictions
still
the
court
pointed
out
in
moor,
that
that
doctrine,
the
pendent
jurisdiction
involves
consideration
for
judicial
economy,
inconvenience,
and
fairness.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
sweeping
in
these
200
people
with
200
separate
and
distinct
claims
runs
a
180
degrees
away
from
consideration
to
judicial
economy
and
fairness
of
convenience.
these
cases
which
are
sought
to
be
swept
in
here
on
the
class
action
belonging
to
state
courts.
there
is
as
plaintiff's
counsel
pointed
out,
a
vermont
class
action
statute,
it’s
a
chinese
copy
of
federal
rule
23,
it
was
passed
in
july
71,
a
couple
of
months,
a
few
months
after
this
complaint
was
brought.
my
client
is
suable
in
this
court,
in
the
state
courts
of
vermont.
there’s
no
jurisdictional
bar
with
respect
to
vermont
class
action
statute
because
according
to
my
reading
of
vermont
law,
the
county
courts
have
cases
involving
$200
a
year.
so,
this
isn’t
the
case,
for
the
unnamed
plaintiffs
are
going
to
be
debarred
from
suing
in
an
appropriate
forum.
they
have
their
forum,
it’s
available,
we
can
be
sued
there.
one
final
observation,
basically
as
plaintiff's
counsels
said,
this
case
involves
claims
of
nuisance
and
trespass
whether
under
the
federal
rubric
or
the
state
rubric,
and
because
that’s
so,
we
will
have
a
situation
which
is
mass
tort,
and
i
remind
this
court
that
the
notes
to
the
advisory
committee
with
respect
to
the
change
in
rule
23
said
that
ordinarily,
class
action
treatment
would
not
be
appropriate
to
mass
tort
situations.
and
even
if
the
text
writers
who
are
in
favor
of
class
actions
have
come
down
on
that
for
the
same
reason
and
the
reasons
are
just
those
i
mentioned
that
each
and
everyone
of
these
plaintiffs
is
going
to
have
to
present
a
set
of
different
facts
of
the
court.
and
this
certainly
would
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
rule
23
that
common
factual
(inaudible)
--
mr.
taggart
whipple
as
far
as
federal
law
goes.
mr.
taggart
whipple
well,
in
either
event,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plaintiffs
would
be
met
by
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount.
and
i
don’t
think
that
you
get
a
different
rule
for
a
different
result
for
that
reason.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
agree,
your
honor.
the
fundamental
case,
the
threshold
hurdle
is
whether
the
limit
to
the
jurisdiction,
that
is
always
applied
to
the
federal
district
court
is
here
as
going
to
be
disregarded
when
we
sweep
in
these
200
class
people,
none
of
whom,
according
to
the
complaint
have
a
jurisdictional
claim
rule
over
$10,000.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
do,
your
honor
because
if
it’s
federal
law
then
1331
(a)
governs
which
speaks
of
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
of
the
law
as
to
the
united
states
and
that
has
a
$10,000
jurisdictional
limitation
in
it.
and
the
reason
for
the
$10,000
limit
there
is
just
the
same
as
it
is
in
1332
(a)
namely,
to
try
to
stable
up
and
to
prevent
the
ever
mounting
case
load.
mr.
taggart
whipple
on
your
assumption,
the
federal
common
law
would
govern,
then
i
think
the
state
courts
would
apply
federal
common
law.
and
i
argued
this
before,
your
honor
in
the
original
case
where
you
directed
this
to
argue
federal
common
or
a
state
common
law,
and
it
seems
to
me
there
would
be
no
difficulty
there
because
as
i
understand
it
in
trying
to
evolve
a
federal
common
law,
the
courts
look
to
a
variety
of
sources
including
relevant
state
law.
mr.
taggart
whipple
i
think
so,
i
think
that’s
the
clear
teaching
of
milwaukee
and
other
cases,
but
i
don’t
want
you
to
believe
that
i’m
conceding
that
federal
common
law
governs
here
or
not.
in
summary,
from
the
standpoint
of
discretion
of
power,
this
is
my
closing
summary,
your
honor.
ancillary
or
pendent
jurisdiction
is
improper
here
because
it
would
impermissibly
expand
contrary
to
rule
82,
the
limited
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts,
it
would
multiply,
i
think
in
geometrical
proportions,
the
rising
case
out
of
the
federal
courts,
it
would
--
finally,
contrary
to
the
principles
enunciated
in
gibbs
and
moore,
and
the
principle
spelled
out
in
snyder,
and
it
would
be
contrary
to
congressional
purpose
underlying
the
$10,000
limitation.
i
may
save
some
time
if
necessary
to
comment
on
mr.
langrock’s
rebuttal.
mr.
taggart
whipple
there
wouldn’t
be
any
state
claim
to
be
pendent.
