unknown
speaker
i’m
trying
to
understand.
levit
is
ruling
mr.
langrock.
he
simply
held
that
in
his
view
of
the
law,
that
each
of
the
plaintiffs
having
to
have
$10,000
as
a
matter
in
controversy.
it
was
not
efficient
to
maintain
it
as
a
class
action.
i
didn’t
get
the
feeling
in
from
his
ruling
that
he
felt
that
he
was
absolutely
debarred,
had
he
reached
another
result
as
to
the
practicality
thing
in
view
of
his
view
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
interpreting
snyder
against
harris
as
he
did,
he
then
went
on
to
conclude
that
there
would
be
such
serious
complications
in
delay
in
determining
who
was
bound
and
who
wasn’t.
that
this
was
not
maintainable
as
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
make
a
finding
to
that
effect,
do
you
mean
that
he
should
be
able
to
include
in
the
class,
people
who
do
not
themselves
have
$10,000
in
controversy.
isn’t
the
case
of
clark
versus
paul
gray
that
was
cited
in
snyder,
and
that
was
cited
in
second
circuit
opinion,
that
306
u.s
case.
wouldn’t
we
have
to
overrule
that
to
go
a
long
way?
unknown
speaker
but
one
of
them
did.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
follow
the
reasoning
of
snyder
against
harris,
the
rules
could
be
amended
to
one
as
blow
in
the
face
and
you’re
still
subject
to
the
jurisdictional
limitations
of
the
statute,
and
all
the
court
was
interpreting
in
clark
versus
paul
gray
was
the
statute
that
the
fact
of
the
class
action
rule
may
have
been
driven
and
certainly
doesn’t
affect
their
reasoning
as
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
but,
nonetheless,
the
court
in
clark
did
say
that
and
that
was
after
the
decision
in
ben-hur
which
had
ruled
the
way
you
indicated
on
diversity.
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
diversity
suit
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and,
there’s
no
basis
here
for
saying
that
federal
law
governs
this
case,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
when
you
will
you
be
on
stronger
ground
or
in
firmer
ground
in
talking
about
pendent
jurisdiction
if
you’re
starting
off
with
a
federal
law
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
know
ancillary
too.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
say
there
need
to
be
as
much
pressure
in
the
cases
–
or
much
supporting
the
cases
for
reaching
out
for
other
state
causes
of
action
that
joined
with
another
state
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
what
was
about
the
governing
law
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
on
the
merits
is
there
any
--
is
this
a
state
law?
what
governs,
state
or
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
in
all
these
claims.
unknown
speaker
is
it
an
interstate
pollution
sort
of
case?
unknown
speaker
and
then
there’s
a
--
is
there
a
state
line
in
between
them?
unknown
speaker
the
plant
now
is
not
in
operation
anymore,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
perhaps
in
one
of
our
original
actions
in
which
we
denied
the
lead
to
file,
was
it
illinois
against
the
city
of
milwaukee,
we
had
something
to
say
about
the
governing
law
in
interstate
pollution
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
it
might
make
a
lot
of
difference
as
to
what
--
whether
–
about
that
ancillary
--
if
this
is
not
been
federal
law,
you
might
have
a
very
different
case.
unknown
speaker
you
talk
as
though
there
should
be
might
a
choice
on
it.
unknown
speaker
there
might
be
and
might
not
be
too.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
invoked
federal
jurisdiction
exclusively
upon
the
basis
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
would
it
not
be
a
just
as
much
of
a
problem
for
the
defendant
in
a
state
court
as
here?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
for
their
choice?
unknown
speaker
why
aren’t
you
in
state
court?
unknown
speaker
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
that?
unknown
speaker
we
think
you
don’t
need
to
get
into
the
merits
now
on
your
side.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
litigation
will
go
on
as
respects
for
each
of
whom
has
the
corporate
jurisdictional
amount.
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
it
is
not
the
quite
the
same
posture
as
--
not
of
course,
i
didn’t
agree
with
snyder
but
that
--
unknown
speaker
or
that
may
just
reflect
the
fault
of
dissenters
who
usually
sound
and
alarm
bigger
than
there's
warned
in.
unknown
speaker
have
you
considered
our
decision
in
illinois
and
city
in
milwaukee?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don’t
--
well,
do
you
think
that
it
has
any
bearing
on
what
law
governs
on
the
merits
of
this
litigation?
unknown
speaker
well,
i’m
just
wondering
after
illinois
and
milwaukee,
where
we
said
federal
law
governs
federal
commonwealth
had
still
to
be
developed.
would
the
district
court
be
free
to
apply
state
law?
i
understand
that
what
is
involved
here
is
alleged
pollution
from
the
new
york
side
which
by
your
client,
that
caused
damaged
to
the
plaintiff
here
on
the
vermont
side.
unknown
speaker
what
about
liability
though,
mr.
whipple?
what
about
the
initial
question
of
liability?
you’re
going
to
have
on
set
of
laws
--
one
set
of
law,
one
law
govern
the
original
acts
that
your
litigating
and
another
law
governing
this
suit
here
with
respect
to
the
very
same
pollution?
unknown
speaker
now,
that’s
going
to
be
a
federal
common
law,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
the
question
of
whether
there’s
an
obligation
to
remove
or
whether
there’s
been
a
violation
of
somebody’s
rights
in
the
first
place
is
going
to
be
a
question
of
federal
law,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
in
the
original
action.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
if
you
take
a
case
like
george
against
tennessee
copper
where
the
court
intimated
that
there
would
be
a
kind
of
federal
common
law
rule.
there
is
no
intimation
there
that
the
same
rule
would
govern
an
action
between
private
parties.
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
so,
when
you
don’t
take
it,
it
makes
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
argument
about
ancillary
or
pendent
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
draw
out
a
single
point
from
snyder
that
gave
the
court’
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
even
federal
law
governed
here
so
that
this
are
not
a
diversity
state
law
case
and
there
is
no
problem
with
pendent
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
on
200
of
these
in
the
federal
--
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
that
one
accepts
the
hypothesis
advanced
by
justice
white
and
justice
brennan
that
each
individual
might
have
a
claim
under
state
law
and
also
under
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
my
premise
was
that
there
be
no
state
law
claim
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and,
this
is
a
kind
of
pollution
case
which
under
milwaukee
is
governed
by
federal
law
then
there’s
no
problem
as
to
any
of
these
200
claims.
of
a
state
law
claim,
it’s
entirely
a
--
all
200
are
under
the
federal
claim.
unknown
speaker
mr.
whipple,
to
take
three
different
hypotheses,
if
you
will,
which
may
represent
views
of
very
members
of
the
court
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
that
is
governed
by
state
law
that
the
rule
governing
an
action
where
a
state
is
involved
where
you
have
federal
common
law,
doesn’t
apply
to
action
between
private
parties,
that
is
the
first
hypothesis.
the
second
is
that
you
would
have
two
sets
of
laws
available
to
private
parties,
both
of
which
would
govern,
where
a
state
is
a
party,
and
also
the
vermont
law.
and
the
third
being
that
you
would
have
only
federal
law
as
justice
brennan
suggests.
and
the
second
of
those
hypotheses
that
i
read,
you
would
have
a
case
for
pendent
jurisdiction,
wouldn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
the
zahns
themselves
might
have
pendent
jurisdiction
under
my
second
hypothesis.
unknown
speaker
but
they
couldn’t
bring
someone
else
in
who
had
less
than
the
$10,000.
unknown
speaker
the
state
law
of
claims
to
the
zahns
or
to
the
leasers?
have
i
answered
your
question?
unknown
speaker
you’re
suggesting
that
you
might
have
different
aspects
here,
just
a
suit
for
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
but
now
as
far
as
the
permissibility
of
the
class
action.
unknown
speaker
you
think,
mr.
whipple
that
clark
is
an
obstacle
to
the
petitioner’s
case
whether
or
not
state
of
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
and
those
with
less
than
$10,000
claim
we
will
have
to
go
to
state
courts,
and
the
state
courts
and
the
federal
law
governs
have
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
actually,
i
think
we
said
in
milwaukee,
did
we
not,
that
we
might
in
fashioning
federal
rules
consults
state
standards.
unknown
speaker
and,
do
you
offer
something
to
say
about
the
manageability
factor?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
figure
in
any
event
that
this
was
governed
by
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
that
you
really
marked
this
down
that
the
characterization
of
the
very
question
as
an
issue
of
federal
law,
you
concede
does
not
assist
you
much.
unknown
speaker
--there
is
no
significance
and
i
did
know
the
answer
but
i
do
not,
what
is
the
comparative
state
of
calendars
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
state
courts
in
the
state
of
vermont?
unknown
speaker
now,
do
state
calendars
greatly
--
unknown
speaker
i’m
trying
to
understand.
levit
is
ruling
mr.
langrock.
he
simply
held
that
in
his
view
of
the
law,
that
each
of
the
plaintiffs
having
to
have
$10,000
as
a
matter
in
controversy.
it
was
not
efficient
to
maintain
it
as
a
class
action.
i
didn’t
get
the
feeling
in
from
his
ruling
that
he
felt
that
he
was
absolutely
debarred,
had
he
reached
another
result
as
to
the
practicality
thing
in
view
of
his
view
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
interpreting
snyder
against
harris
as
he
did,
he
then
went
on
to
conclude
that
there
would
be
such
serious
complications
in
delay
in
determining
who
was
bound
and
who
wasn’t.
that
this
was
not
maintainable
as
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
make
a
finding
to
that
effect,
do
you
mean
that
he
should
be
able
to
include
in
the
class,
people
who
do
not
themselves
have
$10,000
in
controversy.
isn’t
the
case
of
clark
versus
paul
gray
that
was
cited
in
snyder,
and
that
was
cited
in
second
circuit
opinion,
that
306
u.s
case.
wouldn’t
we
have
to
overrule
that
to
go
a
long
way?
unknown
speaker
but
one
of
them
did.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
follow
the
reasoning
of
snyder
against
harris,
the
rules
could
be
amended
to
one
as
blow
in
the
face
and
you’re
still
subject
to
the
jurisdictional
limitations
of
the
statute,
and
all
the
court
was
interpreting
in
clark
versus
paul
gray
was
the
statute
that
the
fact
of
the
class
action
rule
may
have
been
driven
and
certainly
doesn’t
affect
their
reasoning
as
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
but,
nonetheless,
the
court
in
clark
did
say
that
and
that
was
after
the
decision
in
ben-hur
which
had
ruled
the
way
you
indicated
on
diversity.
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
diversity
suit
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and,
there’s
no
basis
here
for
saying
that
federal
law
governs
this
case,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
when
you
will
you
be
on
stronger
ground
or
in
firmer
ground
in
talking
about
pendent
jurisdiction
if
you’re
starting
off
with
a
federal
law
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
know
ancillary
too.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
say
there
need
to
be
as
much
pressure
in
the
cases
–
or
much
supporting
the
cases
for
reaching
out
for
other
state
causes
of
action
that
joined
with
another
state
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
what
was
about
the
governing
law
on
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
on
the
merits
is
there
any
--
is
this
a
state
law?
what
governs,
state
or
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
in
all
these
claims.
unknown
speaker
is
it
an
interstate
pollution
sort
of
case?
unknown
speaker
and
then
there’s
a
--
is
there
a
state
line
in
between
them?
unknown
speaker
the
plant
now
is
not
in
operation
anymore,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
perhaps
in
one
of
our
original
actions
in
which
we
denied
the
lead
to
file,
was
it
illinois
against
the
city
of
milwaukee,
we
had
something
to
say
about
the
governing
law
in
interstate
pollution
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
it
might
make
a
lot
of
difference
as
to
what
--
whether
–
about
that
ancillary
--
if
this
is
not
been
federal
law,
you
might
have
a
very
different
case.
unknown
speaker
you
talk
as
though
there
should
be
might
a
choice
on
it.
unknown
speaker
there
might
be
and
might
not
be
too.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
invoked
federal
jurisdiction
exclusively
upon
the
basis
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
would
it
not
be
a
just
as
much
of
a
problem
for
the
defendant
in
a
state
court
as
here?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
for
their
choice?
unknown
speaker
why
aren’t
you
in
state
court?
unknown
speaker
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
that?
unknown
speaker
we
think
you
don’t
need
to
get
into
the
merits
now
on
your
side.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
litigation
will
go
on
as
respects
for
each
of
whom
has
the
corporate
jurisdictional
amount.
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
it
is
not
the
quite
the
same
posture
as
--
not
of

i
didn’t
agree
with
snyder
but
that

unknown
speaker
have
you
considered
our
decision
in
illinois
and
city
in
milwaukee?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don’t
--
well,
do
you
think
that
it
has
any
bearing
on
what
law
governs
on
the
merits
of
this
litigation?
unknown
speaker
well,
i’m
just
wondering
after
illinois
and
milwaukee,
where
we
said
federal
law
governs
federal
commonwealth
had
still
to
be
developed.
would
the
district
court
be
free
to
apply
state
law?
i
understand
that
what
is
involved
here
is
alleged
pollution
from
the
new
york
side
which
by
your
client,
that
caused
damaged
to
the
plaintiff
here
on
the
vermont
side.
unknown
speaker
what
about
liability
though,
mr.
whipple?
what
about
the
initial
question
of
liability?
you’re
going
to
have
on
set
of
laws
--
one
set
of
law,
one
law
govern
the
original
acts
that
your
litigating
and
another
law
governing
this
suit
here
with
respect
to
the
very
same
pollution?
unknown
speaker
now,
that’s
going
to
be
a
federal
common
law,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
the
question
of
whether
there’s
an
obligation
to
remove
or
whether
there’s
been
a
violation
of
somebody’s
rights
in
the
first
place
is
going
to
be
a
question
of
federal
law,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
in
the
original
action.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
if
you
take
a
case
like
george
against
tennessee
copper
where
the
court
intimated
that
there
would
be
a
kind
of
federal
common
law
rule.
there
is
no
intimation
there
that
the
same
rule
would
govern
an
action
between
private
parties.
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
so,
when
you
don’t
take
it,
it
makes
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
argument
about
ancillary
or
pendent
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
[voice

draw
out
a
single
point
from
snyder
that
gave
the
court’
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
even
federal
law
governed
here
so
that
this
are
not
a
diversity
state
law
case
and
there
is
no
problem
with
pendent
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
on
200
of
these
in
the
federal
--
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
that
one
accepts
the
hypothesis
advanced
by
justice
white
and
justice
brennan
that
each
individual
might
have
a
claim
under
state
law
and
also
under
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
my
premise
was
that
there
be
no
state
law
claim
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and,
this
is
a
kind
of
pollution
case
which
under
milwaukee
is
governed
by
federal
law
then
there’s
no
problem
as
to
any
of
these
200
claims.
of
a
state
law
claim,
it’s
entirely
a
--
all
200
are
under
the
federal
claim.
unknown
speaker
mr.
whipple,
to
take
three
different
hypotheses,
if
you
will,
which
may
represent
views
of
very
members
of
the
court
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
that
is
governed
by
state
law
that
the
rule
governing
an
action
where
a
state
is
involved
where
you
have
federal
common
law,
doesn’t
apply
to
action
between
private
parties,
that
is
the
first
hypothesis.
the
second
is
that
you
would
have
two
sets
of
laws
available
to
private
parties,
both
of
which
would
govern,
where
a
state
is
a
party,
and
also
the
vermont
law.
and
the
third
being
that
you
would
have
only
federal
law
as
justice
brennan
suggests.
and
the
second
of
those
hypotheses
that
i
read,
you
would
have
a
case
for
pendent
jurisdiction,
wouldn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
the
zahns
themselves
might
have
pendent
jurisdiction
under
my
second
hypothesis.
unknown
speaker
but
they
couldn’t
bring
someone
else
in
who
had
less
than
the
$10,000.
unknown
speaker
the
state
law
of
claims
to
the
zahns
or
to
the
leasers?
have
i
answered
your
question?
unknown
speaker
you’re
suggesting
that
you
might
have
different
aspects
here,
just
a
suit
for
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
but
now
as
far
as
the
permissibility
of
the
class
action.
unknown
speaker
you
think,
mr.
whipple
that
clark
is
an
obstacle
to
the
petitioner’s
case
whether
or
not
state
of
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
and
those
with
less
than
$10,000
claim
we
will
have
to
go
to
state
courts,
and
the
state
courts
and
the
federal
law
governs
have
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
actually,
i
think
we
said
in
milwaukee,
did
we
not,
that
we
might
in
fashioning
federal
rules
consults
state
standards.
unknown
speaker
and,
do
you
offer
something
to
say
about
the
manageability
factor?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
figure
in
any
event
that
this
was
governed
by
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
that
you
really
marked
this
down
that
the
characterization
of
the
very
question
as
an
issue
of
federal
law,
you
concede
does
not
assist
you
much.
unknown
speaker
--there
is
no
significance
and
i
did
know
the
answer
but
i
do
not,
what
is
the
comparative
state
of
calendars
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
state
courts
in
the
state
of
vermont?
unknown
speaker
now,
do
state
calendars
greatly
--
