justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
argument
you
just
made
mr.
whipple
that
this
kind
of
mass
tort
thing
is
not
amenable
to
class
action.
i
take
it
all
petitioners
asking
us
to
do
is
to
say
that
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
amount
doesn’t
apply
to
each
and
every
claimant
and
it
is
perfect
rule
and
have
the
district
court
consider
a
new
whether
this
would
be
manageable
as
a
class
action
if
he
was
wrong
on
the
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
langrock,
in
the
appendix
where
your
complaint
is
reprinted
at
pages
six
and
seven.
i
noticed
in
count
one,
you
say
that
the
matter
in
controversy
exclusive
in
federal
clause
as
each
of
the
unnamed
plaintiffs
succeed
the
sum
of
$10,000
jurisdiction
as
founded
on
28
u.s.c.
section
1332
(a).
now,
do
you
contend
that
at
this
stage
of
the
case,
you
have
the
right
to
rely
on
some
other
jurisdictional
basis
rather
than
what
you
named
in
your
complaint?
