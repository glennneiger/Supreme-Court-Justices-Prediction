may
it
please
the
court.
john
jordan,
the
plaintiff-respondent
in
this
case
filed
a
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
individually
and
as
representative
of
a
class,
seeking
an
injunctive
relief
and
damages
for
violation
of
the
federal
welfare
regulations
against
former
directors
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
other
county
officials
charged
with
administrating
the
welfare
program.
specifically,
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
certain
sections
under
the
illinois
categorical
assistance
manual
were
invalid,
being
inconsistent
with
the
30-day
and
the
60-day
determination
requirements
as
defined
by
the
regulations
of
the
united
states
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
the
defendants
in
this
matter
denied
the
allegations,
material
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
welfare
program
involved
is
the
aid
to
the
aged,
blind,
and
disabled,
and
is
one
of
the
categorical
assistance
programs
that
it
is
administered
by
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
under
the
illinois
public
aid
code.
the
program
is
funded
50%
by
the
state,
and
the
other
50%
is
provided
by
the
federal
government
under
the
social
security
act.
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
issued
regulations
pursuant
to
statute
setting
up
eligibility
and
payment
requirements.
and
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
which
administers
the
welfare
program
for
the
federal
government
promulgated
regulations
pursuant
to
the
social
security
act,
setting
up
time
limitations
for
the
determination
of
eligibility
and
the
payments
of
benefits.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
contended
that
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
was
required
to
process
all
applications
for
welfare
assistance
for
the
aged
and
the
blind
within
30
days,
and
for
the
disabled
within
60
days
of
the
initial
application.
having
failed
to
process
such
applications
within
the
specified
time
so
plaintiffs
contended,
the
plaintiff
class
was
entitled
to
monetary
award
commencing
on
july
1,
1968
which
is
the
date
of
the
federal
regulations
went
into
effect
to
be
computed
by
the
amount
of
money,
the
members
of
the
class
would
have
received,
had
their
applications
been
processed
within
the
30
and
the
60-day
requirements.
the
defendants
never
claimed
that
all
such
applications
were
process
within
the
30
and
the
60
days.
indeed,
the
defendants
pointed
out
that
some
applications
take
longer
to
process
than
others
because
of
various
factors
which
must
be
determined
in
order
to
establish
eligibility
for
the
particular
applicants.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
plaintiffs
and
enter
the
judgment
that
provided
among
other
things
that
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
be
permanently
enjoined
from
failing
to
make
a
determination
of
eligibility
and
payment
within
the
30
days
of
initial
application
for
aid
to
the
aged
and
blind,
and
within
60
days
of
the
initial
application
for
the
disabled
under
the
illinois
aid
to
the
aged,
blind,
and
disabled
program.
the
district
court
also
found
for
the
plaintiffs
on
the
monetary
award
question.
it
required
the
defendants
to
make
all
payments
not
made
to
the
applications
would
apply
for
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
benefits
between
july
1,
1968,
the
day
that
the
federal
regulation
went
into
effect,
and
april
16,
1972,
the
date
that
the
district
court
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
mandating
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
to
make
the
payments
within
the
30
days.
for
the
aged
and
the
blind
applicants
who
did
not
receive
their
initial
benefit
check
within
the
30
days
from
the
date
of
application,
the
order
provided
for
the
payment
of
a
sum
of
money
equal
to
the
assistance
they
would
have
received
for
the
period
beginning
on
the
30th
day
from
the
date
of
application
for
the
--
to
the
date
their
entitlement
became
effective.
for
the
disabled,
they
were
two
different
dates
because
of
the
fact
of
the
change
of
the
regulations
during
the
course
of
this
cause
of
action.
but
in
affect,
the
order
provided
for
the
payment
of
money
equal
to
the
assistance
they
would
have
received
for
the
period
beginning
either
with
the
45th
day
or
the
60th
day,
depending
upon
the
date
of
the
entitlement
or
the
date
of
the
application
to
the
date
that
they
actually
received
their
first
benefit.
appeal
followed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
appeal
was
based
substantially
on
the
same
grounds
that
are
raised
in
the
instant
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
in
particular,
it
was
pointed
out
that
an
action
for
a
monetary
award
filed
against
state
officials
in
their
official
capacity
the
award
to
be
discharged
out
of
the
general
revenue
fund
of
the
state
of
illinois
could
not
be
maintained
by
federal
district
court
in
view
of
the
provisions
of
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
unites
states
constitution.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
contention
and
found
that
a
retroactive
money
award
given
to
welfare
recipients
did
not
contravene
the
prohibition
of
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
a
suit
seeking
payment
of
a
money
award
from
the
general
revenue
fund
of
a
state
by
class
of
welfare
recipients
sounding
in
equity,
whether
it
be
characterized
as
restitution
or
damages
in
within
the
clear
meaning
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
hence
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
and
the
opinion
on
mandate
of
the
seventh
circuit
as
they
apply
to
the
monetary
award
should
be
reversed
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no
sir,
i
do
not
and
this
court
has
so
held
i
believe
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
prospective
application
of
the
law
--
the
prospective
application
in
monetary
award,
but
particularly,
those
claims
where
brought
under
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
constitution.
we
have
a
situation
here.
there
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
constitution
of
those
provisions.
here,
we
have
a
violation,
if
any,
of
the
regulations
of
the
social
security
administration
which
are
statutory
regulations
which
would
require
the
payment
of
retroactive
benefits.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
really
don’t
feel
as
distinguished.
i
believe
that
the
court
has
never
addressed
itself
to
the
eleventh
amendment
prohibition
for
the
awarding
of
these
fees.
i
believe
there
was
one
case
and
i
can’t
think
of
the
name
of
that
right
now,
but
it
was
awarded
as
a
deterrent
to
the
defendants
in
that
case
because
of
the
fact
that
they
had
complicitly
did
not
obey
the
court’s
order
that
there
had
been
a
contempt
citation.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir.
no,
i
am
not.
there
is
an
argument
to
that
effect
though,
of
course
and
that
the
respondents,
i
believe,
will
make
that
argument,
but
i
believe
that
the
eleventh
amendment
of
course
as
it
applies
to
the
states
but
not
as
it
applies
to
individuals
would
not
be
certain
about
it.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
it
is.
and
that’s
the
whole
naacp
brief
that
is
amicus
or
amicus
in
this
case
goes
into
the
reconstruction
statutes
and
indicates
that
there
has
been
a
superseding
of
the
eleventh
amendment
by
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
they
have
--
summarily
affirmed.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
but
the
issue
was
raised
in
briefs,
but
the
court
had
never
addressed
itself
to
the
question.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
hear
that.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
it’s
a
denial
of
certiorari,
yes
sir
and
there’s
arguments
on
both
sides
to
that
question
of
course,
rothstein
versus
wyman
which
is
the
second
circuit
court
of
opinion.
many
of
the
jurisdictions
hold
the
fact
that
this
court
did
not
entertain
certiorari
in
that
case
such
a
precedent
that
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
is
a
valid
argument.
the
other
side
we’ve
argued
in
our
case
to
the
fact
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
rejected
the
eleventh
amendment
argument.
rothstein
versus
wyman
is
a
--
bringing
it
up
as
a
second
circuit
case
which
dealt
with
the
same
subject
matter
as
this
involved
here,
yet
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
in
this
case,
the
second
circuit
in
the
rothstein
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bargain
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
release
of
benefits
supposedly
wrongfully
withheld.
there
the
second
circuit
went
into
a
long
examination
of
this
court‘s
opinion
in
rosado
versus
wyman
and
the
fact
that
pursuant
to
rosado
versus
wyman,
the
only
remedy
afforded
by
the
social
security
act
was
the
withholding
of
federal
funds
from
the
state
and
that
it
was
not
a
personal
thing
to
the
welfare
recipients,
and
the
second
circuit
held
on
that
basis
that
there
was
an
improper
exercise
of
equity
jurisdiction
by
the
lower
court
in
awarding
retroactive
benefits.
the
state
however
in
the
appeal
raised
the
eleventh
amendment
which
provides
that
a
federal
judicial
power
did
not
extend
to
suits
against
the
state,
and
the
court
in
rothstein
versus
wyman
held
that
the
point
was
well
taken
that
insofar
as
retroactive
payments
are
concern,
it
is
in
truth
a
suit
against
the
state
of
new
york
which
the
state
of
new
york
had
never
consented.
the
court
in
the
rothstein
case
then
stated
and
i
quote
“it
is
one
thing
to
tell
the
commissioner
of
social
services
that
he
must
comply
with
federal
standards
for
the
future
if
the
state
is
to
have
the
benefits
of
federal
funds
and
the
programs
he
administered.
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
where
the
commissioner
to
use
funds
to
make
preparation
for
the
past.
the
latter
would
appear
to
us
would
fall
a
foul
of
the
eleventh
amendment
if
that
basic
constitutional
provision
is
to
be
conceive
as
having
any
present
force”.
the
respondents
argue
in
their
brief
that
the
petitioners
in
this
cause
of
action
failed
to
raise
the
eleventh
amendment
argue
on
the
defense
in
the
trial
court
and
only
alleged
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
seventh
circuit.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
find
these
arguments
sufficiently
sound
so
as
to
preclude
its
own
analysis
of
the
applicability
of
the
eleventh
amendment
argument.
it
is
admitted
by
your
petitioners
that
it
did
not
raise
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
in
the
trial
court,
but
contends
that
there
was
no
language
in
the
respondents’
complaint
from
which
the
eleventh
defense
could
be
anticipated
as
the
thrust
of
the
plaintiffs’
complaint
was
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
now,
it
would
have
been
futile
for
illinois
to
have
raised
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
law.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess,
i
was
just
indicating
to
the
court
that
the
thrust
of
the
plaintiffs’
complaint
in
this
cause
of
action
was
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
and
we
maintain
it
would
have
been
futile
for
the
state
of
illinois
to
have
raised
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
with
respect
to
prospective
application
of
the
law.
the
application
of
the
fiction
of
ex
parte
young
was
and
it’s
quite
clear.
clearly,
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
prohibit
federal
courts
from
ordering
state
officials
to
bring
their
conduct
in
conformity
with
the
federal
law.
therefore,
no
question
was
entertained
about
this
district
court’s
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
declaratory
judgment
or
a
mandatory
junction
compelling
future
conformity
with
the
administration
of
the
illinois
public
welfare
program
with
the
federal
statutes
in
the
federal
regulations.
furthermore,
the
illinois’s
assistant
attorney
general
who
appeared
on
behalf
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
in
the
trial
court
as
a
matter
of
law
could
not
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
argument.
this
follows
through
with
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
and
in
our
state,
the
law
is
quite
clear,
both
case
law
and
through
the
constitution
that
the
only
that
can
waive
these
arguments
are
the
state
legislature
itself.
in
ford
motor
company
versus
the
treasury
department
of
the
state
of
indiana,
justice
reed
in
delivering
the
opinion
to
the
court
stated,
“the
objection
to
petitioner
suit
has
a
violation
of
the
eleventh
amendment
was
first
made
and
argued
by
indiana
in
this
court.
this
was
in
time
however.
the
eleventh
amendment
declares
a
policy
and
sets
forth
in
explicit
limitation
on
the
federal
judicial
power
of
such
compelling
force.
this
court
will
consider
the
issue
arising
under
this
amendment
in
this
case
even
though
urge
for
the
first
time
in
this
court”.
but
is
in
controversy
in
this
case
are
the
limitations
of
the
applications
of
the
ex
parte
young
fiction.
it
is
submitted
that
if
a
suit
fits
to
declare
a
liability
which
must
be
met
from
the
general
revenue
fund
of
the
state
which
is
mandated
by
its
own
constitution
of
matching
its
cause
with
this
anticipated
revenue,
then
federal
courts
are
without
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit
without
the
expressed
consent
of
the
state.
this
court
recently
stated
in
employees
versus
missouri
public
health
department
that
it
was
not
easy
to
infer
that
congress
in
legislating
pursuant
to
the
commerce
clause
which
has
grown
in
vast
proportions
in
its
application
desired
silently
to
deprive
the
state
of
an
immunity
which
they
have
long
enjoyed
under
another
part
of
the
constitution.
thus,
we
cannot
conclude
that
congress
conditionally
operation
of
these
facilities
on
the
forfeiture
of
an
immunity
from
suit
a
federal
form.”
similar,
either
is
no
language
in
the
social
security
administration
act
that
either
expressly
or
impliedly
shows
the
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
deprive
the
states
of
their
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
there
is
also
nothing
in
the
compact
between
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
and
the
united
states
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
that
expressly
conditions,
illinois’
participation
in
the
federally-assisted
program
on
its
waiver
of
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
consistent
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
congress
enacted
an
apparently
exclusive
remedy
in
the
form
of
cutoff
of
future
funds
when
the
state
failed
to
conformed
to
the
federal
law,
and
this
is
found
in
42
u.s.c.
604.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutory
enactment
that
provides
for
an
expressed
or
an
implied
right
to
payment
of
retroactive
assistance.
the
remedy
provided
is
the
cutoff
of
future
funds.
no
mention
being
made
of
a
right
to
welfare
assistance
to
retroactive
payments.
the
united
states
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
recently
sought
legislation
in
the
second
session
of
the
91st
congress
that
would
have
granted
the
right
of
retroactive
assistance
to
welfare
recipients.
this
legislation
was
never
enacted,
which
makes
it
clear
that
congress
never
intended
to
give
and
now
has
rejected
legislation,
giving
welfare
recipients
a
right
to
retroactive
assistance.
as
was
pointed
out
in
this
court
in
employees
versus
missouri
public
health
department,
it
is
not
easy
to
infer
that
congress
in
legislating
desired
silently
to
deprive
the
states
of
an
immunity
that
it
is
long
enjoyed.
in
rothstein
versus
wyman
again,
the
second
circuit
court
case,
the
second
circuit
advanced
three
basic
reasons
why
retroactive
assistance
should
not
be
granted.
the
first
relates
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
welfare
legislation,
that
of
satisfying
present
ascertain
needs
of
the
impoverished
people,
recognizing
that
federal
standards
are
designed
to
ensure
that
those
needs
are
equitably
met.
the
court
properly
observed
that
the
passage
of
time
makes
such
payments
compensatory
rather
than
remedial
since
the
coincidence
between
the
ascertained
and
existing
needs
becomes
less
clear.
the
second
reason
or
interest
noted
by
the
rothstein
court
was
that
of
assuring
of
proper
use
of
federal
funds.
the
second
circuit
court
found
that
the
interest
was
not
a
personal
interest
to
the
welfare
recipients
since
congress
provided
that
the
cutoff
of
federal
funds
was
the
appropriate
remedy.
the
third
and
most
compelling
reason
for
implying
a
right
to
retroactive
assistance
was
found
to
be
a
willful
deterrence
of
state
violations
of
federal
laws.
none
was
found
in
the
rothstein
context,
and
we
submit
that
none
may
be
found
in
the
illinois
context.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no
sir,
we
did
not.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
there
are
such
problems
as
the
chief
justice
points
out.
there
are
other
problems
of
course
too,
particularly,
with
the
disabled
and
the
blind
assistance.
there,
there
is
a
matter
of
determining
the
extent
of
the
disability
and
whether
or
not
the
person
is
disabled.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no.
if
the
court
please,
the
congress
did
not
set
the
times.
congress
merely
indicated
that
the
determination
of
the
eligibility
and
the
payment
must
be
reasonably
prompt
or
with
proper
determinate
leave
--
with
reasonable
promptness.
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
in
formulating
the
regulations
then
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
subsequently
if
the
court
please,
the
determination
time
for
the
disabled
persons
has
been
extended.
originally,
it
was
45
days
then
extended
to
60
days.
in
october
17
just
this
year,
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
promulgated
new
regulations
that
give
now
45
days
for
the
aged
and
the
blind,
but
make
the
payment
to
go
back
to
the
30th
day
after
the
initial
application.
there
are
problems
and
they
have
been
recognized.
we
do
submit
in
the
appendix
various
graphs
that
not
graphs
but
charts
that
show
the
length
of
time
that
illinois
has
had
to
process
some
of
these
applications.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no
sir,
not
when
we
have
effective
application
of
it,
and
we
are
complying
--
illinois
is
complying
with
that
at
the
present
time.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
back
to
the
30th
day,
yes
sir
under
the
present
regulations.
they
were
able
to
provide
--
the
state
is
able
and
according
to
the
injunction
that
was
entered
in
this
matter
originally
on
april
16.
we
have
been
complying
with
going
back.
we
are
able
to
budget
our
appropriations
with
that
in
mind.
we
are
talking
about
as
the
money
award
for
the
benefits
that
were
withheld
in
the
past.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
we
are.
we
maintain
that
that’s
unreasonable
regulation
that
we
are
having
difficulty
and
living
with
it.
we’re
making
the
determination
of
the
eligibility.
the
respondents
in
their
brief
urge
that
or
impliedly
urge
that
illinois
impliedly
consented
to
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
as
a
result
of
participation
in
the
federally-funded
assisted
program.
according
to
the
seventh
circuit,
the
three
advanced
in
parden
versus
terminal
railway
should
necessitate
the
finding
that
illinois
had
indeed
waived
this
immunity.
the
seventh
circuit
in
citing
parden
found
that
illinois
surely
left
the
spear
that
--
was
exclusive
its
own
when
it
began
as
participation
in
the
federal
state
welfare
program,
and
thereby
waived
its
immunity.
however,
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
holding
this
waive
runs
counter
to
this
court’s
holding
in
employees
versus.
missouri
department
of
health
and
welfare.
the
respondents
have
contended
in
their
brief
that
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
is
not
properly
joined
in
this
cause
because
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
illinois
has
abolished
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
examination
of
the
history
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
our
state
established
its
continued
existence
and
its
viability.
in
1970,
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois
ratified
a
new
constitution.
at
the
time
of
this
suit
was
filed,
illinois
was
functioning
under
the
constitution
of
1870.
article
iv,
section
26
of
the
illinois
constitution
of
1870
provided
that
the
state
of
illinois
shall
not
be
made
a
defendant
in
any
court
of
law
or
equity.
now,
recognizing
that
persons
might
have
legitimate
claims
against
the
state
of
illinois
which
ought
to
be
paid,
the
illinois
general
assembly
passed
a
court
of
claims
act
pursuant
to
the
grant
of
authority
contained
in
the
1870
constitution
in
effect
that
act
was
to
provide
that
persons
with
certain
types
of
claims
against
the
state
of
illinois
which
were
otherwise
be
bartered
by
article
iv,
section
26
of
the
constitution
could
be
brought
him
the
court
of
claims.
decisions
made
by
the
court
of
claims
are
mere
recommendations
to
the
state
legislature
which
must
may
take
affirmative
action
to
appropriate
funds
to
pay
the
claims
founds
by
the
court
of
claims
to
be
just.
it
is
true
that
article
xiii,
section
4
of
the
illinois
constitution
of
1970
which
became
effective
january
1,
1972,
altered
the
old
rule
of
sovereign
immunity
by
providing,
except
as
the
general
assembly
may
provide
by
law,
sovereign
immunity
in
this
state
is
abolished.
the
general
assembly
then
enacted
to
restore
sovereign
immunity
by
enacting
section
801,
chapter
127
of
the
illinois
revise
statutes.
that
act
became
affective
on
january
1,
1972,
the
same
date
that
the
1970
constitution
took
affect
by
the
transition
schedule.
that
particular
act
provides,
except
as
provided
in
an
act
to
create
the
court
of
claims
filed
july
17,
1945
as
amended.
the
state
of
illinois
shall
not
be
made
a
defendant
or
party
in
any
court.
in
other
words,
section
801
restored
sovereign
immunity
illinois,
but
reaffirmed
the
rights
of
persons
to
bring
claims
against
the
state
of
illinois
in
its
court
of
claims.
and
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
reserved
my
remaining
time.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
we
maintain
that
is
if
mr.
justice
blackmun
of
the
court
please,
there
the
similarities
are
--
similarities
are
very,
very
alike.
there,
there
was
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
here,
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
we
also
have
a
situation
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
been
in
the
public
aid
business
for
many,
many
year
before
the
regulation
as
to
the
30
and
60
days
took
affect,
and
we
have
the
right
to
believe
that
we
were
operating
it
properly
and
correctly
such
as
the
state
had
the
right
to
believe
that
they’re
operating
the
hospitals
pursuant
to
their
prior
authority.
i
believe
that
there’s
a
number
of
similarities.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
we
do
that
there
with
a
federal
court
of
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct,
neither
expressly
or
impliedly.
and
this
court
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
think
so,
if
the
court
please,
this
court
so
held
in
rosado
versus
wyman
that
the
sole
remedy
for
the
--
against
the
state
for
failure
to
comply
would
be
the
cutoff
of
federal
funds.
we
believe
that
any
action
would
actually
sound
in
the
federal
government
rather
than
in
action
for
retroactive
benefits.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
we
agree
with
the
injunction,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
that’s
correct.
well,
then
nor
was
it
in
rosado
versus
wyman.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
we
maintain
that
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
just
one
or
two
short
items,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
the
court
in
questioning
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
roodman
relative
to
the
question
about
unjust
in
richman,
it
is
upon
a
point.
they
keep
characterizing
their
relief
is
equitable
restitution,
and
we
maintain
that
as
the
establishment
of
equitable
restitution,
there
must
be
unjust
to
richman
if
someone.
certainly,
the
director
did
not
receive
any
money.
the
state
of
illinois
did
not
receive
any
money.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
appropriations
for
welfare
for
all
of
the
years
in
question
were
completely
exhausted.
not
one
cent
was
returned
to
the
treasury
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that
was
pursuant
to
an
affidavit
filed
by
the
plaintiffs
which
was
never
responded
to
by
the
defendants.
it’s
true
that
we
knew
that
the
regulations
where
inconsistent
in
the
state
of
illinois
with
the
regulations
of
hew.
that
was
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
we
were
your
honor,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
respondents
in
their
brief
makes
also
a
point
that
we
were
being
sued
at
this
present
time
in
rodriguez
versus
swank
with
the
aid
of
the
dependant
children
program,
on
much
the
same
type
of
thing.
but
we
contend
that
this
not
necessarily
follow
that
we
showed
bad
faith
that
there
was
willful
violation
of
this
because
what
we
were
doing
was
pursuing
a
legal
remedy
that
we
felt
we
had
or
legal
theory
we
had,
and
we
respectfully
submitted
that
some
proper
allege
of
the
exhaustion
are
ones
we
call
it
remedies
as
anyway
indicates
bad
faith.
question
of
the
magnitude
of
the
job
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
other
state
throughout
the
union
has
to
do
in
the
welfare
program
in
determining
eligibility.
the
number
of
people
that
were
on
welfare,
in
1967
was
420,665
people
in
the
state
of
illinois.
this
is
gone
now
to
at
the
present
time,
983,600.
in
just
one
year,
the
year
1967
or
1971,
397,281
people
were
added
to
the
welfare
roles.
so,
we
do
have
a
problem
of
having
peak
periods
and
having
low
periods
as
to
determining
eligibility.
the
counsel
points
out
two
cases
that
he
relies
upon
are
rather
heavily,
the
powell
case
relative
to
the
payment
of
retroactive
--
retroactive
payments
for
rents
that
were
withheld,
and
also
the
mitchell
case
relative
to
wages,
neither
one
of
these
case
as
we
submit
was
a
case
against
a
state
and
in
both
of
those
cases,
we
believe
that
the
principle
of
equitable
restitution
was
a
proper
one.
there
had
been
unjust
for
richman,
both
in
the
landlord
that
charged
the
over
amount
of
rents
and
also
in
the
employer
that
had
not
paid
the
wages
according
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
that
if
the
court
please,
we
rest.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
may
it
please
the
court.
john
jordan,
the
plaintiff-respondent
in
this
case
filed
a
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
individually
and
as
representative
of
a
class,
seeking
an
injunctive
relief
and
damages
for
violation
of
the
federal
welfare
regulations
against
former
directors
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
other
county
officials
charged
with
administrating
the
welfare
program.
specifically,
the
plaintiffs
alleged
that
certain
sections
under
the
illinois
categorical
assistance
manual
were
invalid,
being
inconsistent
with
the
30-day
and
the
60-day
determination
requirements
as
defined
by
the
regulations
of
the
united
states
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
the
defendants
in
this
matter
denied
the
allegations,
material
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
welfare
program
involved
is
the
aid
to
the
aged,
blind,
and
disabled,
and
is
one
of
the
categorical
assistance
programs
that
it
is
administered
by
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
under
the
illinois
public
aid
code.
the
program
is
funded
50%
by
the
state,
and
the
other
50%
is
provided
by
the
federal
government
under
the
social
security
act.
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
issued
regulations
pursuant
to
statute
setting
up
eligibility
and
payment
requirements.
and
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
which
administers
the
welfare
program
for
the
federal
government
promulgated
regulations
pursuant
to
the
social
security
act,
setting
up
time
limitations
for
the
determination
of
eligibility
and
the
payments
of
benefits.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
contended
that
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
was
required
to
process
all
applications
for
welfare
assistance
for
the
aged
and
the
blind
within
30
days,
and
for
the
disabled
within
60
days
of
the
initial
application.
having
failed
to
process
such
applications
within
the
specified
time
so
plaintiffs
contended,
the
plaintiff
class
was
entitled
to
monetary
award
commencing
on
july
1,
1968
which
is
the
date
of
the
federal
regulations
went
into
effect
to
be
computed
by
the
amount
of
money,
the
members
of
the
class
would
have
received,
had
their
applications
been
processed
within
the
30
and
the
60-day
requirements.
the
defendants
never
claimed
that
all
such
applications
were
process
within
the
30
and
the
60
days.
indeed,
the
defendants
pointed
out
that
some
applications
take
longer
to
process
than
others
because
of
various
factors
which
must
be
determined
in
order
to
establish
eligibility
for
the
particular
applicants.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
plaintiffs
and
enter
the
judgment
that
provided
among
other
things
that
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
be
permanently
enjoined
from
failing
to
make
a
determination
of
eligibility
and
payment
within
the
30
days
of
initial
application
for
aid
to
the
aged
and
blind,
and
within
60
days
of
the
initial
application
for
the
disabled
under
the
illinois
aid
to
the
aged,
blind,
and
disabled
program.
the
district
court
also
found
for
the
plaintiffs
on
the
monetary
award
question.
it
required
the
defendants
to
make
all
payments
not
made
to
the
applications
would
apply
for
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
benefits
between
july
1,
1968,
the
day
that
the
federal
regulation
went
into
effect,
and
april
16,
1972,
the
date
that
the
district
court
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
mandating
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
to
make
the
payments
within
the
30
days.
for
the
aged
and
the
blind
applicants
who
did
not
receive
their
initial
benefit
check
within
the
30
days
from
the
date
of
application,
the
order
provided
for
the
payment
of
a
sum
of
money
equal
to
the
assistance
they
would
have
received
for
the
period
beginning
on
the
30th
day
from
the
date
of
application
for
the
--
to
the
date
their
entitlement
became
effective.
for
the
disabled,
they
were
two
different
dates
because
of
the
fact
of
the
change
of
the
regulations
during
the
course
of
this
cause
of
action.
but
in
affect,
the
order
provided
for
the
payment
of
money
equal
to
the
assistance
they
would
have
received
for
the
period
beginning
either
with
the
45th
day
or
the
60th
day,
depending
upon
the
date
of
the
entitlement
or
the
date
of
the
application
to
the
date
that
they
actually
received
their
first
benefit.
appeal
followed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
appeal
was
based
substantially
on
the
same
grounds
that
are
raised
in
the
instant
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
in
particular,
it
was
pointed
out
that
an
action
for
a
monetary
award
filed
against
state
officials
in
their
official
capacity
the
award
to
be
discharged
out
of
the
general
revenue
fund
of
the
state
of
illinois
could
not
be
maintained
by
federal
district
court
in
view
of
the
provisions
of
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
unites
states
constitution.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
contention
and
found
that
a
retroactive
money
award
given
to
welfare
recipients
did
not
contravene
the
prohibition
of
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
a
suit
seeking
payment
of
a
money
award
from
the
general
revenue
fund
of
a
state
by
class
of
welfare
recipients
sounding
in
equity,
whether
it
be
characterized
as
restitution
or
damages
in
within
the
clear
meaning
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
hence
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
and
the
opinion
on
mandate
of
the
seventh
circuit
as
they
apply
to
the
monetary
award
should
be
reversed
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no
sir,
i
do
not
and
this
court
has
so
held
i
believe
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
prospective
application
of
the
law
--
the
prospective
application
in
monetary
award,
but
particularly,
those
claims
where
brought
under
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
constitution.
we
have
a
situation
here.
there
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
constitution
of
those
provisions.
here,
we
have
a
violation,
if
any,
of
the
regulations
of
the
social
security
administration
which
are
statutory
regulations
which
would
require
the
payment
of
retroactive
benefits.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
really
don’t
feel
as
distinguished.
i
believe
that
the
court
has
never
addressed
itself
to
the
eleventh
amendment
prohibition
for
the
awarding
of
these
fees.
i
believe
there
was
one
case
and
i
can’t
think
of
the
name
of
that
right
now,
but
it
was
awarded
as
a
deterrent
to
the
defendants
in
that
case
because
of
the
fact
that
they
had
complicitly
did
not
obey
the
court’s
order
that
there
had
been
a
contempt
citation.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir.
no,
i
am
not.
there
is
an
argument
to
that
effect
though,
of
course
and
that
the
respondents,
i
believe,
will
make
that
argument,
but
i
believe
that
the
eleventh
amendment
of
course
as
it
applies
to
the
states
but
not
as
it
applies
to
individuals
would
not
be
certain
about
it.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
it
is.
and
that’s
the
whole
naacp
brief
that
is
amicus
or
amicus
in
this
case
goes
into
the
reconstruction
statutes
and
indicates
that
there
has
been
a
superseding
of
the
eleventh
amendment
by
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
they
have
--
summarily
affirmed.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
but
the
issue
was
raised
in
briefs,
but
the
court
had
never
addressed
itself
to
the
question.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn’t
hear
that.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
it’s
a
denial
of
certiorari,
yes
sir
and
there’s
arguments
on
both
sides
to
that
question
of
course,
rothstein
versus
wyman
which
is
the
second
circuit
court
of
opinion.
many
of
the
jurisdictions
hold
the
fact
that
this
court
did
not
entertain
certiorari
in
that
case
such
a
precedent
that
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
is
a
valid
argument.
the
other
side
we’ve
argued
in
our
case
to
the
fact
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
rejected
the
eleventh
amendment
argument.
rothstein
versus
wyman
is
a
--
bringing
it
up
as
a
second
circuit
case
which
dealt
with
the
same
subject
matter
as
this
involved
here,
yet
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
in
this
case,
the
second
circuit
in
the
rothstein
held
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bargain
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
release
of
benefits
supposedly
wrongfully
withheld.
there
the
second
circuit
went
into
a
long
examination
of
this
court‘s
opinion
in
rosado
versus
wyman
and
the
fact
that
pursuant
to
rosado
versus
wyman,
the
only
remedy
afforded
by
the
social
security
act
was
the
withholding
of
federal
funds
from
the
state
and
that
it
was
not
a
personal
thing
to
the
welfare
recipients,
and
the
second
circuit
held
on
that
basis
that
there
was
an
improper
exercise
of
equity
jurisdiction
by
the
lower
court
in
awarding
retroactive
benefits.
the
state
however
in
the
appeal
raised
the
eleventh
amendment
which
provides
that
a
federal
judicial
power
did
not
extend
to
suits
against
the
state,
and
the
court
in
rothstein
versus
wyman
held
that
the
point
was
well
taken
that
insofar
as
retroactive
payments
are
concern,
it
is
in
truth
a
suit
against
the
state
of
new
york
which
the
state
of
new
york
had
never
consented.
the
court
in
the
rothstein
case
then
stated
and
i
quote
“it
is
one
thing
to
tell
the
commissioner
of
social
services
that
he
must
comply
with
federal
standards
for
the
future
if
the
state
is
to
have
the
benefits
of
federal
funds
and
the
programs
he
administered.
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
where
the
commissioner
to
use
funds
to
make
preparation
for
the
past.
the
latter
would
appear
to
us
would
fall
a
foul
of
the
eleventh
amendment
if
that
basic
constitutional
provision
is
to
be
conceive
as
having
any
present
force”.
the
respondents
argue
in
their
brief
that
the
petitioners
in
this
cause
of
action
failed
to
raise
the
eleventh
amendment
argue
on
the
defense
in
the
trial
court
and
only
alleged
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
seventh
circuit.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
find
these
arguments
sufficiently
sound
so
as
to
preclude
its
own
analysis
of
the
applicability
of
the
eleventh
amendment
argument.
it
is
admitted
by
your
petitioners
that
it
did
not
raise
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
in
the
trial
court,
but
contends
that
there
was
no
language
in
the
respondents’
complaint
from
which
the
eleventh
defense
could
be
anticipated
as
the
thrust
of
the
plaintiffs’
complaint
was
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
now,
it
would
have
been
futile
for
illinois
to
have
raised
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
law.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess,
i
was
just
indicating
to
the
court
that
the
thrust
of
the
plaintiffs’
complaint
in
this
cause
of
action
was
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
and
we
maintain
it
would
have
been
futile
for
the
state
of
illinois
to
have
raised
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
with
respect
to
prospective
application
of
the
law.
the
application
of
the
fiction
of
ex
parte
young
was
and
it’s
quite
clear.
clearly,
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
prohibit
federal
courts
from
ordering
state
officials
to
bring
their
conduct
in
conformity
with
the
federal
law.
therefore,
no
question
was
entertained
about
this
district
court’s
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
declaratory
judgment
or
a
mandatory
junction
compelling
future
conformity
with
the
administration
of
the
illinois
public
welfare
program
with
the
federal
statutes
in
the
federal
regulations.
furthermore,
the
illinois’s
assistant
attorney
general
who
appeared
on
behalf
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
in
the
trial
court
as
a
matter
of
law
could
not
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
argument.
this
follows
through
with
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
and
in
our
state,
the
law
is
quite
clear,
both
case
law
and
through
the
constitution
that
the
only
that
can
waive
these
arguments
are
the
state
legislature
itself.
in
ford
motor
company
versus
the
treasury
department
of
the
state
of
indiana,
justice
reed
in
delivering
the
opinion
to
the
court
stated,
“the
objection
to
petitioner
suit
has
a
violation
of
the
eleventh
amendment
was
first
made
and
argued
by
indiana
in
this
court.
this
was
in
time
however.
the
eleventh
amendment
declares
a
policy
and
sets
forth
in
explicit
limitation
on
the
federal
judicial
power
of
such
compelling
force.
this
court
will
consider
the
issue
arising
under
this
amendment
in
this
case
even
though
urge
for
the
first
time
in
this
court”.
but
is
in
controversy
in
this
case
are
the
limitations
of
the
applications
of
the
ex
parte
young
fiction.
it
is
submitted
that
if
a
suit
fits
to
declare
a
liability
which
must
be
met
from
the
general
revenue
fund
of
the
state
which
is
mandated
by
its
own
constitution
of
matching
its
cause
with
this
anticipated
revenue,
then
federal
courts
are
without
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit
without
the
expressed
consent
of
the
state.
this
court
recently
stated
in
employees
versus
missouri
public
health
department
that
it
was
not
easy
to
infer
that
congress
in
legislating
pursuant
to
the
commerce
clause
which
has
grown
in
vast
proportions
in
its
application
desired
silently
to
deprive
the
state
of
an
immunity
which
they
have
long
enjoyed
under
another
part
of
the
constitution.
thus,
we
cannot
conclude
that
congress
conditionally
operation
of
these
facilities
on
the
forfeiture
of
an
immunity
from
suit
a
federal
form.”
similar,
either
is
no
language
in
the
social
security
administration
act
that
either
expressly
or
impliedly
shows
the
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
deprive
the
states
of
their
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
there
is
also
nothing
in
the
compact
between
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
and
the
united
states
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
that
expressly
conditions,
illinois’
participation
in
the
federally-assisted
program
on
its
waiver
of
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
consistent
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
congress
enacted
an
apparently
exclusive
remedy
in
the
form
of
cutoff
of
future
funds
when
the
state
failed
to
conformed
to
the
federal
law,
and
this
is
found
in
42
u.s.c.
604.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutory
enactment
that
provides
for
an
expressed
or
an
implied
right
to
payment
of
retroactive
assistance.
the
remedy
provided
is
the
cutoff
of
future
funds.
no
mention
being
made
of
a
right
to
welfare
assistance
to
retroactive
payments.
the
united
states
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
recently
sought
legislation
in
the
second
session
of
the
91st
congress
that
would
have
granted
the
right
of
retroactive
assistance
to
welfare
recipients.
this
legislation
was
never
enacted,
which
makes
it
clear
that
congress
never
intended
to
give
and
now
has
rejected
legislation,
giving
welfare
recipients
a
right
to
retroactive
assistance.
as
was
pointed
out
in
this
court
in
employees
versus
missouri
public
health
department,
it
is
not
easy
to
infer
that
congress
in
legislating
desired
silently
to
deprive
the
states
of
an
immunity
that
it
is
long
enjoyed.
in
rothstein
versus
wyman
again,
the
second
circuit
court
case,
the
second
circuit
advanced
three
basic
reasons
why
retroactive
assistance
should
not
be
granted.
the
first
relates
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
welfare
legislation,
that
of
satisfying
present
ascertain
needs
of
the
impoverished
people,
recognizing
that
federal
standards
are
designed
to
ensure
that
those
needs
are
equitably
met.
the
court
properly
observed
that
the
passage
of
time
makes
such
payments
compensatory
rather
than
remedial
since
the
coincidence
between
the
ascertained
and
existing
needs
becomes
less
clear.
the
second
reason
or
interest
noted
by
the
rothstein
court
was
that
of
assuring
of
proper
use
of
federal
funds.
the
second
circuit
court
found
that
the
interest
was
not
a
personal
interest
to
the
welfare
recipients
since
congress
provided
that
the
cutoff
of
federal
funds
was
the
appropriate
remedy.
the
third
and
most
compelling
reason
for
implying
a
right
to
retroactive
assistance
was
found
to
be
a
willful
deterrence
of
state
violations
of
federal
laws.
none
was
found
in
the
rothstein
context,
and
we
submit
that
none
may
be
found
in
the
illinois
context.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no
sir,
we
did
not.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
there
are
such
problems
as
the
chief
justice
points
out.
there
are
other
problems
of
course
too,
particularly,
with
the
disabled
and
the
blind
assistance.
there,
there
is
a
matter
of
determining
the
extent
of
the
disability
and
whether
or
not
the
person
is
disabled.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no.
if
the
court
please,
the
congress
did
not
set
the
times.
congress
merely
indicated
that
the
determination
of
the
eligibility
and
the
payment
must
be
reasonably
prompt
or
with
proper
determinate
leave
--
with
reasonable
promptness.
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
in
formulating
the
regulations
then
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
subsequently
if
the
court
please,
the
determination
time
for
the
disabled
persons
has
been
extended.
originally,
it
was
45
days
then
extended
to
60
days.
in
october
17
just
this
year,
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
promulgated
new
regulations
that
give
now
45
days
for
the
aged
and
the
blind,
but
make
the
payment
to
go
back
to
the
30th
day
after
the
initial
application.
there
are
problems
and
they
have
been
recognized.
we
do
submit
in
the
appendix
various
graphs
that
not
graphs
but
charts
that
show
the
length
of
time
that
illinois
has
had
to
process
some
of
these
applications.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no
sir,
not
when
we
have
effective
application
of
it,
and
we
are
complying
--
illinois
is
complying
with
that
at
the
present
time.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
back
to
the
30th
day,
yes
sir
under
the
present
regulations.
they
were
able
to
provide
--
the
state
is
able
and
according
to
the
injunction
that
was
entered
in
this
matter
originally
on
april
16.
we
have
been
complying
with
going
back.
we
are
able
to
budget
our
appropriations
with
that
in
mind.
we
are
talking
about
as
the
money
award
for
the
benefits
that
were
withheld
in
the
past.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
we
are.
we
maintain
that
that’s
unreasonable
regulation
that
we
are
having
difficulty
and
living
with
it.
we’re
making
the
determination
of
the
eligibility.
the
respondents
in
their
brief
urge
that
or
impliedly
urge
that
illinois
impliedly
consented
to
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
as
a
result
of
participation
in
the
federally-funded
assisted
program.
according
to
the
seventh
circuit,
the
three
advanced
in
parden
versus
terminal
railway
should
necessitate
the
finding
that
illinois
had
indeed
waived
this
immunity.
the
seventh
circuit
in
citing
parden
found
that
illinois
surely
left
the
spear
that
--
was
exclusive
its
own
when
it
began
as
participation
in
the
federal
state
welfare
program,
and
thereby
waived
its
immunity.
however,
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
holding
this
waive
runs
counter
to
this
court’s
holding
in
employees
versus.
missouri
department
of
health
and
welfare.
the
respondents
have
contended
in
their
brief
that
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
is
not
properly
joined
in
this
cause
because
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
illinois
has
abolished
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
examination
of
the
history
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
our
state
established
its
continued
existence
and
its
viability.
in
1970,
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois
ratified
a
new
constitution.
at
the
time
of
this
suit
was
filed,
illinois
was
functioning
under
the
constitution
of
1870.
article
iv,
section
26
of
the
illinois
constitution
of
1870
provided
that
the
state
of
illinois
shall
not
be
made
a
defendant
in
any
court
of
law
or
equity.
now,
recognizing
that
persons
might
have
legitimate
claims
against
the
state
of
illinois
which
ought
to
be
paid,
the
illinois
general
assembly
passed
a
court
of
claims
act
pursuant
to
the
grant
of
authority
contained
in
the
1870
constitution
in
effect
that
act
was
to
provide
that
persons
with
certain
types
of
claims
against
the
state
of
illinois
which
were
otherwise
be
bartered
by
article
iv,
section
26
of
the
constitution
could
be
brought
him
the
court
of
claims.
decisions
made
by
the
court
of
claims
are
mere
recommendations
to
the
state
legislature
which
must
may
take
affirmative
action
to
appropriate
funds
to
pay
the
claims
founds
by
the
court
of
claims
to
be
just.
it
is
true
that
article
xiii,
section
4
of
the
illinois
constitution
of
1970
which
became
effective
january
1,
1972,
altered
the
old
rule
of
sovereign
immunity
by
providing,
except
as
the
general
assembly
may
provide
by
law,
sovereign
immunity
in
this
state
is
abolished.
the
general
assembly
then
enacted
to
restore
sovereign
immunity
by
enacting
section
801,
chapter
127
of
the
illinois
revise
statutes.
that
act
became
affective
on
january
1,
1972,
the
same
date
that
the
1970
constitution
took
affect
by
the
transition
schedule.
that
particular
act
provides,
except
as
provided
in
an
act
to
create
the
court
of
claims
filed
july
17,
1945
as
amended.
the
state
of
illinois
shall
not
be
made
a
defendant
or
party
in
any
court.
in
other
words,
section
801
restored
sovereign
immunity
illinois,
but
reaffirmed
the
rights
of
persons
to
bring
claims
against
the
state
of
illinois
in
its
court
of
claims.
and
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
reserved
my
remaining
time.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
we
maintain
that
is
if
mr.
justice
blackmun
of
the
court
please,
there
the
similarities
are
--
similarities
are
very,
very
alike.
there,
there
was
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
here,
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
we
also
have
a
situation
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
been
in
the
public
aid
business
for
many,
many
year
before
the
regulation
as
to
the
30
and
60
days
took
affect,
and
we
have
the
right
to
believe
that
we
were
operating
it
properly
and
correctly
such
as
the
state
had
the
right
to
believe
that
they’re
operating
the
hospitals
pursuant
to
their
prior
authority.
i
believe
that
there’s
a
number
of
similarities.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
we
do
that
there
with
a
federal
court
of
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct,
neither
expressly
or
impliedly.
and
this
court
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
think
so,
if
the
court
please,
this
court
so
held
in
rosado
versus
wyman
that
the
sole
remedy
for
the
--
against
the
state
for
failure
to
comply
would
be
the
cutoff
of
federal
funds.
we
believe
that
any
action
would
actually
sound
in
the
federal
government
rather
than
in
action
for
retroactive
benefits.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
we
agree
with
the
injunction,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
that’s
correct.
well,
then
nor
was
it
in
rosado
versus
wyman.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
we
maintain
that
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
just
one
or
two
short
items,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
the
court
in
questioning
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
roodman
relative
to
the
question
about
unjust
in
richman,
it
is
upon
a
point.
they
keep
characterizing
their
relief
is
equitable
restitution,
and
we
maintain
that
as
the
establishment
of
equitable
restitution,
there
must
be
unjust
to
richman
if
someone.
certainly,
the
director
did
not
receive
any
money.
the
state
of
illinois
did
not
receive
any
money.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
appropriations
for
welfare
for
all
of
the
years
in
question
were
completely
exhausted.
not
one
cent
was
returned
to
the
treasury
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that
was
pursuant
to
an
affidavit
filed
by
the
plaintiffs
which
was
never
responded
to
by
the
defendants.
it’s
true
that
we
knew
that
the
regulations
where
inconsistent
in
the
state
of
illinois
with
the
regulations
of
hew.
that
was
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
we
were
your
honor,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
respondents
in
their
brief
makes
also
a
point
that
we
were
being
sued
at
this
present
time
in
rodriguez
versus
swank
with
the
aid
of
the
dependant
children
program,
on
much
the
same
type
of
thing.
but
we
contend
that
this
not
necessarily
follow
that
we
showed
bad
faith
that
there
was
willful
violation
of
this
because
what
we
were
doing
was
pursuing
a
legal
remedy
that
we
felt
we
had
or
legal
theory
we
had,
and
we
respectfully
submitted
that
some
proper
allege
of
the
exhaustion
are
ones
we
call
it
remedies
as
anyway
indicates
bad
faith.
question
of
the
magnitude
of
the
job
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
other
state
throughout
the
union
has
to
do
in
the
welfare
program
in
determining
eligibility.
the
number
of
people
that
were
on
welfare,
in
1967
was
420,665
people
in
the
state
of
illinois.
this
is
gone
now
to
at
the
present
time,
983,600.
in
just
one
year,
the
year
1967
or
1971,
397,281
people
were
added
to
the
welfare
roles.
so,
we
do
have
a
problem
of
having
peak
periods
and
having
low
periods
as
to
determining
eligibility.
the
counsel
points
out
two
cases
that
he
relies
upon
are
rather
heavily,
the
powell
case
relative
to
the
payment
of
retroactive
--
retroactive
payments
for
rents
that
were
withheld,
and
also
the
mitchell
case
relative
to
wages,
neither
one
of
these
case
as
we
submit
was
a
case
against
a
state
and
in
both
of
those
cases,
we
believe
that
the
principle
of
equitable
restitution
was
a
proper
one.
there
had
been
unjust
for
richman,
both
in
the
landlord
that
charged
the
over
amount
of
rents
and
also
in
the
employer
that
had
not
paid
the
wages
according
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
that
if
the
court
please,
we
rest.
thank
you.
