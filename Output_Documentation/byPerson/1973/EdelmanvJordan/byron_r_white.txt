justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
this
court
has
implicitly
said
that
eleventh
amendment
was
repealed
or
limited
by
the
fourteenth?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
hasn’t
this
court
affirmed
there
are
some
retroactive
welfare
payments?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it’s
--
i
suppose
you
suggest
that
the
issue
was
never
raised
or
flashed
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
did
summarily
rejected
the
eleventh
amendment
arguments
at
least
two
or
three
times.
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
the
eleventh
amendment
argument,
you
still
would
contend
that
back
pay
so
to
speak
is
not
an
appropriate
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
about
all
you’re
saying
in
that
regard
is
that
this
isn’t
expressly
provided
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
the
court
is
there
for
wrong
to
order
back
payments?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
sole
remedy
accepted
injunction
as
far
as
the
future
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
sole
remedy,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
well,
and
arguably,
does
it
mean
arguably
that
it
goes
out
of
it
and
mean
to
foreclose
the
back
payments?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
is
10,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
is
only
one
named
plaintiff
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
there
is
more
than
10,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
alleged
here
only
a
claim
based
on
a
federal
statute;
no
constitutional
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
--
you
did
assert
constitutional
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
the
state
regulations
had
been
approved
by
the
--
or
state
plans
been
approved
by
hew,
there
might
be
some
argument
that
there
shouldn’t
be
retroactive
payments
just
because
a
court
decided
that
the
state
regulations
were
contrary
to
social
security
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did
--
they
did
make
an
argument
that
the
judgment
--
that
the
regulations
were
contrary
to
the
--
that
the
manual
was
contrary
to
hew
regulations--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
should
be
given
only
prospective
affair?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
it
really
says,
it
really
argues
to
have
been
exempted.
there
is
no
equity
in
applying
the
decision
retroactively.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
an
assertion
or
was
there
a
finding
of
the
laws
that
the
director
knew
that
the
manual
was
contrary
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
were
aware
of
that?
