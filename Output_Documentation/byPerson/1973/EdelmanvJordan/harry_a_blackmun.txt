there’s
another
area
developing
of
the
late,

that's
where
attorney’s
fees
are
allowed
in
civil

cases.
justice
harry

do
you
feel
this
is
also
distinguishable
from
this
case?
justice
harry

blackmun
that’s
in
the
an
naacp
brief,
particularly
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
are
taking
the
position
that
the
specified
day
provision
is
not
consistent
with
the
statute.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
ask
one
question
mr.
o’rourke?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
you
logically
say
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
decision
here
in
missouri
employees?
isn’t
there
a
distinct
factual
difference
and
not
there
the
state
was
in
the
hospital
business
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
long
before
the
fela
requirements
went
in.
whereas
here,
that
is
not
so.
and
i
suppose,
there’s
another
factual
difference
and
that
is
--
well
as
of
the
secretary
there
could
bring
suit.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
perhaps
here,
there
is
no
alternative
provision.
i
just
wonder
if
missouri
employees
is
so
conclusive
as
you
intimate
it
is.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
to
get
over
the
prevalent
congress
that
the
regulations
are
consistent
with
the
statute,
don’t
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
have
all
the
sentiment
with
you,
but
i
take
it
from
your
argument.
you’re
saying
that
hew
can
do
almost
anything
and
wanted
to
and
it
wasn’t
--
within
the
months,
we
have
not
got
along
with
any
hew
regulation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
just
been
changed
to
45,
wasn’t
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
it
hasn’t
prevailed
just
didn’t

it
hasn’t
prevailed
consistently

not
