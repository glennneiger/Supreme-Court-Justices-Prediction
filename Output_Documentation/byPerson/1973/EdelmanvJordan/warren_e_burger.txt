mr.

chief

warren
e.

we’ll
resume
there
at
1
o’clock.
[noon
recess]
mr.
o’rourke,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mentioned
earlier
mr.
o’rourke
that
sometimes
and
in
certain
cases,
it
takes
more
time
and
perhaps
30
days
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
make
the
necessary
factual
determination.
i
don’t
recall
whether
in
your
briefs,
you
focused
especially
on
newly
arrived
residents
who
would
make
claims
for
relief
or
other
aid
under
shapiro
holding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
i
should
think
it
might
be
a
special
problem
on
people
who
move
from
southern
california
to
new
york
or
more
likely
from
new
york
to
southern
california
to
find
out
the
status
of
their
financial
condition
and
what
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
what
was
the
purpose
of
congress
as
you
see
it
to
fix
these
rather
shorts
--
a
time
on
it
says
that’s
just
hortatory
advisory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
meant
to
refer
to
their
regulations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
think
this
retroactive
provision
of
the
regulations
on
aid
to
the
blind
is
in
conflict
with
the
eleventh
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
the
determination
is
made,
let’s
assume
the
determination
is
not
made
for
90
days
as
conceivably
might
happen.
its
effective
back
to
the
31st
day,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
roodman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
specifically,
what
federal
law
do
you
say
state
of
illinois
the
officers
were
violating?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
concept
of
an
equitable
cause
of
action
or
restitution
require
that
there
be
someone
in
a
corollary
sense
unjustly
enriched?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
unjustly
enriched
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
think
that’s
unjust
enriched?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there
are
some
forms
of
need
which
could
be
demonstrably
imperative
than
five
days
or
10
days,
but
you
don’t
challenge
the
right
to
have
--
now,
45
days
to
examine.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
refer
to
that
as
a
savings,
what
--
does
that
go
into
the
general
tax
along
with
the
general
tax
revenues
then?
chief

warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

mr.

do
you
have
anything
further?
chief

you.
