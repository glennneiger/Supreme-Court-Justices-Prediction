mr.
sheldon
roodman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
argument,
i
would
first
review
eleventh
amendment
defense
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
director,
and
then
secondly
review
the
reasons
why
upholding
the
relief
granted
by
the
court
below
is
necessary
to
effectuate
compliance
with
the
requirements
in
the
social
security
act.
i
would
also
ask
the
court
to
bear
with
the
cough
that
i
have
at
this
time
throughout
the
argument.
i
apologize
for
it.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
[laughter
attempt]
the
first
defense
and
the
principle
defense
of
the
director
of
illinois
department
of
public
aid
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
the
equitable
restitution
relief
in
this
case.
this
defense
is
raised
in
a
setting
in
a
factual
context
in
which
it
is
not
previously
been
presented
to
this
court.
the
suit
against
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid,
they
concede
as
properly
in
federal
court.
they
concede
that
the
suit
against
the
director
of
the
illinois
depart
--
director
of
the
department
of
public
aid
in
a
relief
which
orders
him
to
process
every
future
application
in
the
entire
state
of
illinois
within
30
days
or
60
days
respectively.
he’s
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
they
further
concede
that
the
portion
of
the
provisions
of
the
judgment
which
require
that
assistance
shall
be
affective
as
of
the
last
day
of
the
respective
time
periods
for
all
future
applicants,
even
those
that
extend
beyond
the
prescribed
time
period.
even
in
those
cases,
that
relief
is
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
however,
with
respect
to
the
incidental,
equitable
relief
of
restitution,
they
claim
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
a
federal
court
from
granting
such
relief.
the
director
claims
that
such
relief
is
barred
by
state
immunity
from
suit.
consequently,
he
must
be
claiming
that
in
denying
members
of
the
plaintiff
class,
their
equitable
entitlement
and
the
statutory
entitlement
and
he
concedes
that
john
jordan
and
all
other
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
were
entitled
to
these
benefits
in
the
first
instance.
that
is
conceded
in
this
case.
but,
it
is
argued
that
the
incidental
relief
of
granting
those
benefits
is
barred
by
the
states
immunity
from
suit.
however,
this
court
in
ex
parte
young
reasoned
that
when
a
state
officer
acts
in
violation
of
paramount
federal
law
that
he
acts
without
the
authority
of
the
state,
the
language
of
ex
parte
young
is
that
he
acts
without
the
authority
of
the
state
that
his
actions
are
simply
an
illegal
act,
that
the
state
has
no
power
to
impart
to
its
officers
immunity
from
responsibility
to
the
supreme
authority
of
the
united
states.
it
is
that
doctrine
that
encompasses
the
entire
relief
in
this
case.
once
this
case
is
in
federal
court,
the
eleventh
amendment
which
applies
to
suits
and
not
to
types
of
relief
no
longer
is
applicable,
the
question
then
becomes
what
--
whether
the
relief
is
appropriate,
but
not
whether
that
such
relief
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
in
interpreting
ex
parte
young,
there
is
no
basis
that
is
offered
by
the
petitioners
in
order
to
bifurcate
that
doctrine.
the
doctrine
applies
to
injunctive
relief.
it
applies
to
all
relief
that
is
necessary
inappropriate.
suggestion
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
constitutional
that
constitutional
cases
are
different
ignores
the
reality
that
in
this
case,
we
have
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
illinois
director
has
violated
federal
requirements
and
in
turn
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
if
that
really
--
if
the
federal
court
believe
that
that
such
relief
was
necessary
and
appropriate
and
incidental
to
the
other
relief
in
this
case,
yes,
i
think
number
one,
its
certainly
the
eleventh
amendment
would
not
bar
that
relief.
we
are
already
in
federal
court.
the
court
has
already
ruled
on
the
merits
of
the
case
and
has
heard
the
case
and
as
an
incident
to
that,
the
court
if
it
deemed
it
necessary
and
appropriate
to
effectuate
compliance
with
the
act,
it
could
grant
that
relief.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
if
the
court
is
suggesting
under
1983,
causes
of
action
against
public
officials,
this
court
as
held
is
permissible
and
the
officials
are
personally
liable
in
those
situations.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
personally
liable
in
damages.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
there
are
two
theories
in
terms
of
the
cause
of
action
that
would
apply
here.
one
is
that
equitable
relief
is
that
there
is
a
right
to
the
statutory
entitlement,
and
that
the
court
in
exercising
its
equitable
powers
is
merely
exercising
the
traditional
powers
of
the
court
to
grant
appropriate
and
complete
relief
to
the
parties
before
the
court.
now,
under
1983,
it
would
be
possible
for
the
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
exercising
its
equitable
powers
may
order
state
officials
to
make
restitution.
now,
the
more
difficult
case
--
if
you
suggest
and
that
restitution
is
no
different
than
the
relief
that
orders
state
officials
in
connection
with
civil
right
cases,
the
school
cases
are
the
reapportioning
of
legislatures.
does
that
answer
the
question,
your
honor?
mr.
sheldon
roodman
the
eleventh
amendment
decision
of
the
defense
then
has
for
two
reasons
is
not
a
bar
to
the
relief
granted
in
this
case.
first,
the
language
of
the
amendment
itself,
the
language
of
the
amendment
uses
the
specific
word
“suit”,
but
they
concede
that
this
suit,
it
says
no
--
the
judicial
power
of
the
unites
states
shall
not
be
construed
to
extent
to
any
suit.
but
they
concede
that
the
suit
against
the
director
is
properly
in
federal
court
under
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young.
thus,
this
court
would
have
to
distort
the
language
of
the
amendment
itself
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
offered
by
the
petitioners,
and
secondly,
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young.
as
we’ve
indicated,
the
rational
is
that
when
a
state
officer
violates
paramount
federal
law,
he
is
stripped
of
his
official
or
representative
capacity.
he’s
acting
without
the
authority
of
the
state
and
the
state
has
no
power
to
impart
to
him
any
immunity
from
responsibility.
in
this
case
in
particular,
we
have
a
situation
where
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
facts.
they’re
setout
in
the
appendix
at
the
page
85
through
89.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
they
were
violating
your
honor
both
the
statutory
provision
which
requires
applications
to
be
processed
with
reasonable
promptness,
and
the
federal
regulations
pursuant
thereto,
the
federal
regulations
which
require
processing
of
applications
within
maximum
time
periods.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
if
the
suit
at
that
point
your
honor,
they
would
bring
a
suit
in
equity
and
in
1983
action,
in
the
federal
court
for
restitution
of
benefits
wrongfully
denied.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
because
for
the
plaintiffs
who
are
wrongfully
denied
their
benefits
in
the
past
as
a
result
of
illegal
acts
of
that
sate
director,
he
would
at
that
time
be
stripped
of
his
authority,
and
as
this
court
has
held,
he
is
not
permitted
to
claim
the
immunity
of
the
state
when
acting
in
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
the
doctrine
of
equitable
restitution
involves
situations
in
which
one
person
should
make
an
accounting
to
the
other
for
either
of
two
reasons.
one,
because
one
person
would
be
unjustly
enriched
or
conversely,
one
person
would
unjustly
suffer
loss.
this
case
has
both
of
those
elements.
particular
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
in
this
case,
in
connection
with
the
unjustly
enriched
aspect,
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
saved
the
expenditure
of
state
funds
that
they
would
--
that
they
were
required
to
make
under
the
law
as
result
of
a
violation
of
law.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
i
would
certainly
rest
the
stronger
part
of
my
case
upon
the
argument
that
john
jordan
and
others
like
him
should
not
unjustly
suffer
loss.
the
restatement
of
restitution
provides
our
states
has
one
of
the
guiding
principles
that
a
person
should
not
profit
by
his
wrong
at
the
expense
of
another.
i
would
like
to
explain
the
facts
your
honor
with
respect
to
your
previous
questions.
it
is
not
just
the
fact
that
some
cases
took
longer
than
30
and
60
days.
first,
there
are
specific
exceptions
to
those
rules
that
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
under
certain
circumstances,
it
is
permissible
under
the
federal
rules
to
take
longer
than
the
prescribed
period.
the
class
of
plaintiffs
that
we’re
talking
about
in
this
case
are
only
those
persons
who
are
eligible
and
did
not
fall
within
that
special
category.
only
those
persons
who
are
eligible
and
the
delays
were
not
as
a
result
of
their
fault
or
any
special
circumstances
with
respect
to
determining
their
eligibility.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
jurisdiction
would
rest
(a)
on
1331.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
if
there
is
10,000?
mr.
sheldon
roodman
there
is
one
named
plaintiff.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
the
circumstances
of
the
named
plaintiff
were
that
he
did
not
have
sufficient
funds
for
the
basic
necessities
of
life.
in
the
affidavit
attached
to
the
complaint
on
the
tro,
the
63-year-old
mentally
disabled
man
was
ill.
he
was
ill,
number
one,
and
malnourished.
secondly,
he
was
in
a
position
where
he
did
not
have
vision
in
one
eye
and
needed
glasses.
if
his
application
had
been
processed,
he
would
have
had
as
an
incident
the
rights
of
aabd
recipients,
a
medical
card
which
would
entitle
him
to
free
medical
--
comprehensive
medical
care.
it
would
maintain
(a)
that
that
$10,000.00
was
at
stake
for
this
individual.
secondly,
we
would
have
jurisdiction
under
1343
(3).
mr.
sheldon
roodman
there
was
a
second
count
your
honor
that
is
not
before
this
court.
there
was
a
second
count
that
does
involved
constitutional
claims.
that
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
upon
that
has
not
been
appealed
to
this
court.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
of
the
jurisdiction?
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes,
it
did
your
honor.
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
on
against
the
plaintiffs
on
the
equal
protection
claim
on
a
separate
issue.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
fact
that
the
delay
is
not
the
essence
of
this
case.
the
fact
that
applications
were
delayed
in
processing
is
not
the
essence
of
this
case.
the
essence
of
the
depravation
in
this
case
is
the
illinois
regulations,
section
8255
which
provided
that
assistance
could
not
be
provided
for
any
month
prior
with
the
month
in
which
the
application
was
approved.
for
example,
with
respect
to
john
jordan
who
applied
in
september
1970,
his
application
was
not
active
upon
as
of
the
date
of
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit.
the
lower
court
that
the
suit
was
filed
in
january
of
1970,
four
months
later,
lower
court
ordered
his
application
to
be
processed.
he
was
determined
eligible
and
was
given
assistance
for
effective
january
1,
1971.
that’s
the
month
in
which
his
application
was
approved.
as
a
result
of
the
illinois
regulation
which
bar
assistance
for
any
month
prior
to
the
month
in
which
the
application
was
approved.
but
for
this
regulation,
even
though
his
application
was
illegally
delayed,
he
would
have
received
assistance
effective
november
1,
1970.
so,
it
is
the
two
months,
november
and
december
1970
that
he
was
--
his
statutory
entitlement
that’s
conceded
in
this
case.
and
this
illinois
regulation
barred
him
from
receiving
those
benefits,
so
that
all
cases
for
all
member
of
the
plaintiff
class,
they
were
entitled
to
these
benefits,
and
it’s
this
regulation
which
barred
them
from
receiving
it.
now,
with
respect
to
this
regulation,
the
established
facts
are
in
this
case,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
appendix
at
pages
85
through
89,
established
facts
are
--
i’m
reading
from
paragraph
5
on
page
87
of
the
appendix.
from
july
1,
1968
to
the
present,
herald
o.
swank
(ph)
willfully
and
in
gross
disregard
the
rights
of
eligible
aabd
applicants,
knew
that
substantial
numbers
of
eligible
aabd
applicants
were
being
deprived
contrary
the
requirements
of
federal
law
of
their
full
aabd
entitlements
effective
30
days
from
the
date
of
their
application
with
respect
to
disability
applicants
45
days
from
the
date
of
their
application,
by
reason
of
the
operation,
implementation
and
enforcement
of
section
8255
and
8255
of
the
illinois
categorical
systems
manual.
the
facts
are
then
that
the
director
knew
from
july
1,
1968
throughout
the
relevant
period
that
the
regulation
for
the
department
of
public
aid
was
contrary
to
the
federal
law
and
deprived
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
of
their
statutory
entitlement.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
that
argument
was
not
raised
before
the
trial
court
at
all.
it
is
not
properly
preserved
for
appeal.
that’s
the
ruling
of
the
seventh
circuit.
it
was
not
presented
at
all
to
the
lower
court,
even
if
we
were
to
consider
it
on
the
merits
your
honor.
all
of
the
other
courts
that
have
considered
the
question
of
whether
the
30-day
and
60-day
maximum
time
standards
have
held
them
to
be
reasonable,
this
court
and
i
would
emphasize
in
the
case
of
rodriguez
versus
swank
which
is
the
related
case
that
involved
afdc
recipients
in
illinois,
raised
that
question
and
the
question
summarily
affirmed
in
this
court.
certainly
your
honor,
even
on
the
merits
though
question
of
providing
assistance
to
people
who
are
needy
and
by
definition
do
not
have
sufficient
funds
for
the
necessities
of
life
within
30
days.
we
maintain
is
not
an
unreasonable
judgment.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
not
they
could
go
--
our
argument
is
not
that
they
could
do
anything.
our
argument
is
that
they’re
just
--
the
judgment
was
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
that
they
urged
and
that
is
the
standard
of
the
petition
that
the
petitioners
must
establish
in
this
case.
we
maintain
that
that
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
judgment
of
the
hew
officials.
it
is
a
standard
that
prevail
since
1951,
your
honor.
for
17
years,
that
standard
of
30
days
has
prevailed.
secondly,
the
standard
in
and
of
itself
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
it
has
been,
your
honor,
just
changed.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
it
has
prevailed
up
until
this
time
your
honor.
i
would
maintain
also,
your
honor,
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
regulation
itself
has
a
specific
exception
provision
for
unusual
circumstances
so
that
the
regulation
does
have
on
an
escape
hatch
in
certain
situations.
but
that
is
not
the
--
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
people
who
by
definition
where
eligible
for
all
those
benefits
and
who
threw
no
fault
of
their
own
whose
applications
were
delayed
in
processing,
and
even
if
and
really,
the
heart
of
the
deprivation
is
that
this
regulation
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
8255
which
barred
assistance
for
any
period
prior
to
the
month
in
which
the
application
was
approved,
it
is
that
regulation
that
have
that
not
existed.
john
jordan
would
have
received
his
full
entitlement
as
of
the
time
when
his
application
was
finally
approved
in
january
of
1971,
so
that
one
right
of
his
would
have
been
violated.
it
would
have
taken
too
long,
but
he
would
have
received
everything
he
would
have
been
entitled
to.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
we
do
not
--
we
accept
the
notion,
we
accept
the
principle
that
eligibility
for
public
assistance
requires
time.
we
accept
the
principle
that
30
days
is
a
reasonable
judgment
for
what
that
time
should
be.
there
are
circumstances
in
which
people
have
need
at
the
moment
that
they
applied.
there
are
special
provisions
for
emergency
assistance
in
those
cases,
but
we
--
should
defer
in
this
case
to
the
judgment
of
hew
over
17
years,
and
then
that
again,
i
will
point
out
that
the
issue
is
not
even
before
the
court
properly.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below
in
the
district
court.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
yes
is
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
the
established
fact
is
set
out
in
pages
85
through
88
of
the
appendix,
established
that
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
knew
that
the
regulation
was
contrary
to
federal
law.
even
if,
your
honor,
it’s
not
considered
willful.
it’s
clear
that
he
understood
that
his
regulation
was
in
violation
of
federal
law,
if
he
had.
and
from
july
1,
1968
and
forward,
if
there
was
any
question
in
his
mind
as
to
the
legality
of
those
regulations,
the
director
could
have
filed
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment.
instead,
he
continues
to
receive
federal
funds
for
all
of
the
period,
knowing
that
his
actions
went
violation
of
federal
law.
but
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
what
we
are
interested
in
and
the
remedy
of
restitution
of
form
is
a
remedy
--
it
is
a
remedy
design
to
deter
all
violations
of
law.
we
are
not
concern
only
with
willful
violations,
but
we
are
concerned
with
deterring
all
violations
of
law.
the
remedy
of
restitution
in
this
case,
and
that
is
within
the
panoply
of
equitable
remedies
that
a
federal
court
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity
has
an
order
to
grant
appropriate
relief
to
the
parties.
this
court
has
held
in
porter
and
mitchell
that
are
described
in
detail
in
our
brief
that
unless
a
statute,
otherwise
restricts
the
powers
of
the
court
of
equity,
that
court
retains
all
of
its
traditional
equitable
powers.
in
porter,
the
question
was
whether
restitution
of
excess
rents
charging
violation
of
emergency
price
control
act
where
a
federal
court
had
authority
to
grant
restitution.
the
court
said
yes.
in
mitchell,
the
question
was
whether
an
employee
who
is
discharged
in
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
wasn’t
and
whether
the
court
had
the
equitable
power
to
grant
restitution
in/or
of
back
wages
in
that
case.
in
each
case,
the
court
reaffirmed
the
principle
that
the
court
of
equity
may
grant
restitution,
unless
if
the
statute
otherwise
restricts.
in
this
case
your
honor,
the
remedy
of
restitution
is
necessary
in
order
to
bring
about
compliance
with
the
social
security
act.
i
think
it
is
worth
pausing
for
a
moment
to
reflect
in
the
situation
that
occurs
without
a
remedy
of
restitution.
without
a
remedy
of
restitution,
director
of
any
public
aid
office
learns
the
valuable
lesson
that
any
federal
provision
under
the
social
security
act
that
is
mandatory
may
be
ignored
with
impunity.
that
savings
and
welfare
budgets
may
be
brought
about
by
violating
the
law
because
there
is
no
effective
sanction.
any
requirement
that
is
considered
onerous
or
unfair,
maybe
disregarded
because
there
is
no
sanction.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
for
example
with
respect
to
john
jordan,
he
was
entitled
to
benefits
for
november
and
december
1970.
position
there
were
taken
and
was
deprived
those
benefits,
and
according
to
the
law
of
illinois,
each
additional
month
they
would
have
delayed,
they
would
have
saved
the
state
share
of
payments
to
john
jordan.
so,
had
we
not
brought
this
suit
and
his
application
would
have
been
remained
non-acted
upon.
for
january,
for
february,
for
march,
the
state
would
have
saved
welfare
payments
for
each
of
those
months.
it
is
our
position
that
that
--
there
must
be
incentives
not
to
save
money
by
violating
the
law.
there
are
the
social
security
act,
provides
legitimate
means
for
the
states
to
control
the
expenditures
and
public
assistance
programs.
this
court
has
so
held
that
if
the
states
sets
its
own
standard
of
need
and
may
pay
less
than
the
full
percentage
of
need,
that
is
the
reasonable
--
that
is
the
legitimate
way
of
states
controlling
public
assistance
expenditures.
on
the
other
hand,
state
directors
of
public
aid,
must
need
some
incentives
to
pay
careful
attention
to
federal
requirements
whenever
they
are
enforcing,
whenever
they
are
adopting
their
regulations
in
taking
positions
in
the
social
security
act.
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
present
remedies
of
an
injunction
prospectively
only
is
not
a
deterrent,
and
certainly,
the
remedy
of
a
total
cutoff
of
federal
funds
is
not
a
deterrent.
it
is
only
the
remedy
of
restitution
that
provides
a
deterrent
and
conversely
provides
an
incentive
to
comply
with
federal
law.
we
would,
at
the
very
least
in
this
cooperative
scheme
of
federalism.
the
states
agree
to
comply
with
the
law.
that
is
the
central
condition
upon
which
the
federal
government
provides
to
the
states
billions
of
dollars.
states
agree
that
we
will
conform
to
federal
law,
and
that’s
their
only
part
of
the
bargain.
if
cooperative
federalism
is
to
work,
it
must
work
under
scheme
where
state
officers
respect
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
supremacy
of
federal
requirements.
if
there
is
not
--
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
on
the
grounds
of
the
remedy
of
restitution
was
inappropriate,
it
would
provide
a
valuable
lesson
to
state
law
officials
that
there
is
no
sanction
for
violating
the
law,
and
particularly
in
the
case,
given
the
established
facts
that
the
director
was
aware
that
his
--
that
the
owner
regulations
was
contrary
to
law.
there
is
no
basis
for
reversing
the
decision.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
that
--
that
is
one
of
the
equitable
considerations
that
the
court
would
take
into
account.
in
this
case,
i
would
point
out
that
in
fact,
the
director
does
not
argue
that
on
the
equities,
the
lower
court
abused
this
discretion.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
i
think
that
that’s
a
different
doctrine
than
the
one
that
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
if
the
court
would
--
that
argument
seems
to
be
that
yes,
we
knew
that
we
are
violating
the
law,
but
now
that
we
are
caught,
we
are
not
to
have
to
provide
the
statutory
entitlements
that
we
were
--
obligated
to
make
in
the
first
place
and
that
we
agree
to
make
in
the
first
place.
with
respect
to
the
question
--
answering
the
question
in
conclusion
with
respect
to
willful
violations
and
whether
hew
approved
it,
we
think
that’s
one
factor
that
the
court
would
consider.
but
of
course,
what
we
are
interested
in
is
deterring
violations
of
all
laws,
and
if
a
court
rules
that
a
state
provision
is
contrary
to
social
security
act
and
the
supremacy
clause,
we
must
remember
that
the
plaintiffs
then
are
being
deprived
to
this
work
deprived
of
their
statutory
entitlements,
and
all
that
of
remedy
or
restitution
does,
it
places
them
in
the
position
that
they
would
have
been
in
but
for
the
violation
of
law.
and
that’s
the
classic
goal
of
restitution.
thank
you.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
argument,
i
would
first
review
eleventh
amendment
defense
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
director,
and
then
secondly
review
the
reasons
why
upholding
the
relief
granted
by
the
court
below
is
necessary
to
effectuate
compliance
with
the
requirements
in
the
social
security
act.
i
would
also
ask
the
court
to
bear
with
the
cough
that
i
have
at
this
time
throughout
the
argument.
i
apologize
for
it.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
[laughter
attempt]
the
first
defense
and
the
principle
defense
of
the
director
of
illinois
department
of
public
aid
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
the
equitable
restitution
relief
in
this
case.
this
defense
is
raised
in
a
setting
in
a
factual
context
in
which
it
is
not
previously
been
presented
to
this
court.
the
suit
against
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid,
they
concede
as
properly
in
federal
court.
they
concede
that
the
suit
against
the
director
of
the
illinois
depart
--
director
of
the
department
of
public
aid
in
a
relief
which
orders
him
to
process
every
future
application
in
the
entire
state
of
illinois
within
30
days
or
60
days
respectively.
he’s
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
they
further
concede
that
the
portion
of
the
provisions
of
the
judgment
which
require
that
assistance
shall
be
affective
as
of
the
last
day
of
the
respective
time
periods
for
all
future
applicants,
even
those
that
extend
beyond
the
prescribed
time
period.
even
in
those
cases,
that
relief
is
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
however,
with
respect
to
the
incidental,
equitable
relief
of
restitution,
they
claim
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
a
federal
court
from
granting
such
relief.
the
director
claims
that
such
relief
is
barred
by
state
immunity
from
suit.
consequently,
he
must
be
claiming
that
in
denying
members
of
the
plaintiff
class,
their
equitable
entitlement
and
the
statutory
entitlement
and
he
concedes
that
john
jordan
and
all
other
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
were
entitled
to
these
benefits
in
the
first
instance.
that
is
conceded
in
this
case.
but,
it
is
argued
that
the
incidental
relief
of
granting
those
benefits
is
barred
by
the
states
immunity
from
suit.
however,
this
court
in
ex
parte
young
reasoned
that
when
a
state
officer
acts
in
violation
of
paramount
federal
law
that
he
acts
without
the
authority
of
the
state,
the
language
of
ex
parte
young
is
that
he
acts
without
the
authority
of
the
state
that
his
actions
are
simply
an
illegal
act,
that
the
state
has
no
power
to
impart
to
its
officers
immunity
from
responsibility
to
the
supreme
authority
of
the
united
states.
it
is
that
doctrine
that
encompasses
the
entire
relief
in
this
case.
once
this
case
is
in
federal
court,
the
eleventh
amendment
which
applies
to
suits
and
not
to
types
of
relief
no
longer
is
applicable,
the
question
then
becomes
what
--
whether
the
relief
is
appropriate,
but
not
whether
that
such
relief
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
in
interpreting
ex
parte
young,
there
is
no
basis
that
is
offered
by
the
petitioners
in
order
to
bifurcate
that
doctrine.
the
doctrine
applies
to
injunctive
relief.
it
applies
to
all
relief
that
is
necessary
inappropriate.
suggestion
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
constitutional
that
constitutional
cases
are
different
ignores
the
reality
that
in
this
case,
we
have
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
illinois
director
has
violated
federal
requirements
and
in
turn
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
if
that
really
--
if
the
federal
court
believe
that
that
such
relief
was
necessary
and
appropriate
and
incidental
to
the
other
relief
in
this
case,
yes,
i
think
number
one,
its
certainly
the
eleventh
amendment
would
not
bar
that
relief.
we
are
already
in
federal
court.
the
court
has
already
ruled
on
the
merits
of
the
case
and
has
heard
the
case
and
as
an
incident
to
that,
the
court
if
it
deemed
it
necessary
and
appropriate
to
effectuate
compliance
with
the
act,
it
could
grant
that
relief.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
if
the
court
is
suggesting
under
1983,
causes
of
action
against
public
officials,
this
court
as
held
is
permissible
and
the
officials
are
personally
liable
in
those
situations.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
personally
liable
in
damages.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
there
are
two
theories
in
terms
of
the
cause
of
action
that
would
apply
here.
one
is
that
equitable
relief
is
that
there
is
a
right
to
the
statutory
entitlement,
and
that
the
court
in
exercising
its
equitable
powers
is
merely
exercising
the
traditional
powers
of
the
court
to
grant
appropriate
and
complete
relief
to
the
parties
before
the
court.
now,
under
1983,
it
would
be
possible
for
the
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
exercising
its
equitable
powers
may
order
state
officials
to
make
restitution.
now,
the
more
difficult
case
--
if
you
suggest
and
that
restitution
is
no
different
than
the
relief
that
orders
state
officials
in
connection
with
civil
right
cases,
the
school
cases
are
the
reapportioning
of
legislatures.
does
that
answer
the
question,
your
honor?
mr.
sheldon
roodman
the
eleventh
amendment
decision
of
the
defense
then
has
for
two
reasons
is
not
a
bar
to
the
relief
granted
in
this
case.
first,
the
language
of
the
amendment
itself,
the
language
of
the
amendment
uses
the
specific
word
“suit”,
but
they
concede
that
this
suit,
it
says
no
--
the
judicial
power
of
the
unites
states
shall
not
be
construed
to
extent
to
any
suit.
but
they
concede
that
the
suit
against
the
director
is
properly
in
federal
court
under
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young.
thus,
this
court
would
have
to
distort
the
language
of
the
amendment
itself
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
offered
by
the
petitioners,
and
secondly,
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young.
as
we’ve
indicated,
the
rational
is
that
when
a
state
officer
violates
paramount
federal
law,
he
is
stripped
of
his
official
or
representative
capacity.
he’s
acting
without
the
authority
of
the
state
and
the
state
has
no
power
to
impart
to
him
any
immunity
from
responsibility.
in
this
case
in
particular,
we
have
a
situation
where
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
facts.
they’re
setout
in
the
appendix
at
the
page
85
through
89.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
they
were
violating
your
honor
both
the
statutory
provision
which
requires
applications
to
be
processed
with
reasonable
promptness,
and
the
federal
regulations
pursuant
thereto,
the
federal
regulations
which
require
processing
of
applications
within
maximum
time
periods.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
if
the
suit
at
that
point
your
honor,
they
would
bring
a
suit
in
equity
and
in
1983
action,
in
the
federal
court
for
restitution
of
benefits
wrongfully
denied.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
because
for
the
plaintiffs
who
are
wrongfully
denied
their
benefits
in
the
past
as
a
result
of
illegal
acts
of
that
sate
director,
he
would
at
that
time
be
stripped
of
his
authority,
and
as
this
court
has
held,
he
is
not
permitted
to
claim
the
immunity
of
the
state
when
acting
in
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
the
doctrine
of
equitable
restitution
involves
situations
in
which
one
person
should
make
an
accounting
to
the
other
for
either
of
two
reasons.
one,
because
one
person
would
be
unjustly
enriched
or
conversely,
one
person
would
unjustly
suffer
loss.
this
case
has
both
of
those
elements.
particular
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
in
this
case,
in
connection
with
the
unjustly
enriched
aspect,
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
saved
the
expenditure
of
state
funds
that
they
would
--
that
they
were
required
to
make
under
the
law
as
result
of
a
violation
of
law.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
i
would
certainly
rest
the
stronger
part
of
my
case
upon
the
argument
that
john
jordan
and
others
like
him
should
not
unjustly
suffer
loss.
the
restatement
of
restitution
provides
our
states
has
one
of
the
guiding
principles
that
a
person
should
not
profit
by
his
wrong
at
the
expense
of
another.
i
would
like
to
explain
the
facts
your
honor
with
respect
to
your
previous
questions.
it
is
not
just
the
fact
that
some
cases
took
longer
than
30
and
60
days.
first,
there
are
specific
exceptions
to
those
rules
that
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
under
certain
circumstances,
it
is
permissible
under
the
federal
rules
to
take
longer
than
the
prescribed
period.
the
class
of
plaintiffs
that
we’re
talking
about
in
this
case
are
only
those
persons
who
are
eligible
and
did
not
fall
within
that
special
category.
only
those
persons
who
are
eligible
and
the
delays
were
not
as
a
result
of
their
fault
or
any
special
circumstances
with
respect
to
determining
their
eligibility.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
jurisdiction
would
rest
(a)
on
1331.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
if
there
is
10,000?
mr.
sheldon
roodman
there
is
one
named
plaintiff.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
the
circumstances
of
the
named
plaintiff
were
that
he
did
not
have
sufficient
funds
for
the
basic
necessities
of
life.
in
the
affidavit
attached
to
the
complaint
on
the
tro,
the
63-year-old
mentally
disabled
man
was
ill.
he
was
ill,
number
one,
and
malnourished.
secondly,
he
was
in
a
position
where
he
did
not
have
vision
in
one
eye
and
needed
glasses.
if
his
application
had
been
processed,
he
would
have
had
as
an
incident
the
rights
of
aabd
recipients,
a
medical
card
which
would
entitle
him
to
free
medical
--
comprehensive
medical
care.
it
would
maintain
(a)
that
that
$10,000.00
was
at
stake
for
this
individual.
secondly,
we
would
have
jurisdiction
under
1343
(3).
mr.
sheldon
roodman
there
was
a
second
count
your
honor
that
is
not
before
this
court.
there
was
a
second
count
that
does
involved
constitutional
claims.
that
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
upon
that
has
not
been
appealed
to
this
court.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
of
the
jurisdiction?
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes,
it
did
your
honor.
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
on
against
the
plaintiffs
on
the
equal
protection
claim
on
a
separate
issue.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
fact
that
the
delay
is
not
the
essence
of
this
case.
the
fact
that
applications
were
delayed
in
processing
is
not
the
essence
of
this
case.
the
essence
of
the
depravation
in
this
case
is
the
illinois
regulations,
section
8255
which
provided
that
assistance
could
not
be
provided
for
any
month
prior
with
the
month
in
which
the
application
was
approved.
for
example,
with
respect
to
john
jordan
who
applied
in
september
1970,
his
application
was
not
active
upon
as
of
the
date
of
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit.
the
lower
court
that
the
suit
was
filed
in
january
of
1970,
four
months
later,
lower
court
ordered
his
application
to
be
processed.
he
was
determined
eligible
and
was
given
assistance
for
effective
january
1,
1971.
that’s
the
month
in
which
his
application
was
approved.
as
a
result
of
the
illinois
regulation
which
bar
assistance
for
any
month
prior
to
the
month
in
which
the
application
was
approved.
but
for
this
regulation,
even
though
his
application
was
illegally
delayed,
he
would
have
received
assistance
effective
november
1,
1970.
so,
it
is
the
two
months,
november
and
december
1970
that
he
was
--
his
statutory
entitlement
that’s
conceded
in
this
case.
and
this
illinois
regulation
barred
him
from
receiving
those
benefits,
so
that
all
cases
for
all
member
of
the
plaintiff
class,
they
were
entitled
to
these
benefits,
and
it’s
this
regulation
which
barred
them
from
receiving
it.
now,
with
respect
to
this
regulation,
the
established
facts
are
in
this
case,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
appendix
at
pages
85
through
89,
established
facts
are
--
i’m
reading
from
paragraph
5
on
page
87
of
the
appendix.
from
july
1,
1968
to
the
present,
herald
o.
swank
(ph)
willfully
and
in
gross
disregard
the
rights
of
eligible
aabd
applicants,
knew
that
substantial
numbers
of
eligible
aabd
applicants
were
being
deprived
contrary
the
requirements
of
federal
law
of
their
full
aabd
entitlements
effective
30
days
from
the
date
of
their
application
with
respect
to
disability
applicants
45
days
from
the
date
of
their
application,
by
reason
of
the
operation,
implementation
and
enforcement
of
section
8255
and
8255
of
the
illinois
categorical
systems
manual.
the
facts
are
then
that
the
director
knew
from
july
1,
1968
throughout
the
relevant
period
that
the
regulation
for
the
department
of
public
aid
was
contrary
to
the
federal
law
and
deprived
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
of
their
statutory
entitlement.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
that
argument
was
not
raised
before
the
trial
court
at
all.
it
is
not
properly
preserved
for
appeal.
that’s
the
ruling
of
the
seventh
circuit.
it
was
not
presented
at
all
to
the
lower
court,
even
if
we
were
to
consider
it
on
the
merits
your
honor.
all
of
the
other
courts
that
have
considered
the
question
of
whether
the
30-day
and
60-day
maximum
time
standards
have
held
them
to
be
reasonable,
this
court
and
i
would
emphasize
in
the
case
of
rodriguez
versus
swank
which
is
the
related
case
that
involved
afdc
recipients
in
illinois,
raised
that
question
and
the
question
summarily
affirmed
in
this
court.
certainly
your
honor,
even
on
the
merits
though
question
of
providing
assistance
to
people
who
are
needy
and
by
definition
do
not
have
sufficient
funds
for
the
necessities
of
life
within
30
days.
we
maintain
is
not
an
unreasonable
judgment.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
not
they
could
go
--
our
argument
is
not
that
they
could
do
anything.
our
argument
is
that
they’re
just
--
the
judgment
was
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
that
they
urged
and
that
is
the
standard
of
the
petition
that
the
petitioners
must
establish
in
this
case.
we
maintain
that
that
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
judgment
of
the
hew
officials.
it
is
a
standard
that
prevail
since
1951,
your
honor.
for
17
years,
that
standard
of
30
days
has
prevailed.
secondly,
the
standard
in
and
of
itself
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
it
has
been,
your
honor,
just
changed.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
it
has
prevailed
up
until
this
time
your
honor.
i
would
maintain
also,
your
honor,
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
regulation
itself
has
a
specific
exception
provision
for
unusual
circumstances
so
that
the
regulation
does
have
on
an
escape
hatch
in
certain
situations.
but
that
is
not
the
--
in
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
people
who
by
definition
where
eligible
for
all
those
benefits
and
who
threw
no
fault
of
their
own
whose
applications
were
delayed
in
processing,
and
even
if
and
really,
the
heart
of
the
deprivation
is
that
this
regulation
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
8255
which
barred
assistance
for
any
period
prior
to
the
month
in
which
the
application
was
approved,
it
is
that
regulation
that
have
that
not
existed.
john
jordan
would
have
received
his
full
entitlement
as
of
the
time
when
his
application
was
finally
approved
in
january
of
1971,
so
that
one
right
of
his
would
have
been
violated.
it
would
have
taken
too
long,
but
he
would
have
received
everything
he
would
have
been
entitled
to.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
we
do
not
--
we
accept
the
notion,
we
accept
the
principle
that
eligibility
for
public
assistance
requires
time.
we
accept
the
principle
that
30
days
is
a
reasonable
judgment
for
what
that
time
should
be.
there
are
circumstances
in
which
people
have
need
at
the
moment
that
they
applied.
there
are
special
provisions
for
emergency
assistance
in
those
cases,
but
we
--
should
defer
in
this
case
to
the
judgment
of
hew
over
17
years,
and
then
that
again,
i
will
point
out
that
the
issue
is
not
even
before
the
court
properly.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below
in
the
district
court.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
yes
is
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
the
established
fact
is
set
out
in
pages
85
through
88
of
the
appendix,
established
that
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
knew
that
the
regulation
was
contrary
to
federal
law.
even
if,
your
honor,
it’s
not
considered
willful.
it’s
clear
that
he
understood
that
his
regulation
was
in
violation
of
federal
law,
if
he
had.
and
from
july
1,
1968
and
forward,
if
there
was
any
question
in
his
mind
as
to
the
legality
of
those
regulations,
the
director
could
have
filed
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment.
instead,
he
continues
to
receive
federal
funds
for
all
of
the
period,
knowing
that
his
actions
went
violation
of
federal
law.
but
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
what
we
are
interested
in
and
the
remedy
of
restitution
of
form
is
a
remedy
--
it
is
a
remedy
design
to
deter
all
violations
of
law.
we
are
not
concern
only
with
willful
violations,
but
we
are
concerned
with
deterring
all
violations
of
law.
the
remedy
of
restitution
in
this
case,
and
that
is
within
the
panoply
of
equitable
remedies
that
a
federal
court
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity
has
an
order
to
grant
appropriate
relief
to
the
parties.
this
court
has
held
in
porter
and
mitchell
that
are
described
in
detail
in
our
brief
that
unless
a
statute,
otherwise
restricts
the
powers
of
the
court
of
equity,
that
court
retains
all
of
its
traditional
equitable
powers.
in
porter,
the
question
was
whether
restitution
of
excess
rents
charging
violation
of
emergency
price
control
act
where
a
federal
court
had
authority
to
grant
restitution.
the
court
said
yes.
in
mitchell,
the
question
was
whether
an
employee
who
is
discharged
in
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
wasn’t
and
whether
the
court
had
the
equitable
power
to
grant
restitution
in/or
of
back
wages
in
that
case.
in
each
case,
the
court
reaffirmed
the
principle
that
the
court
of
equity
may
grant
restitution,
unless
if
the
statute
otherwise
restricts.
in
this
case
your
honor,
the
remedy
of
restitution
is
necessary
in
order
to
bring
about
compliance
with
the
social
security
act.
i
think
it
is
worth
pausing
for
a
moment
to
reflect
in
the
situation
that
occurs
without
a
remedy
of
restitution.
without
a
remedy
of
restitution,
director
of
any
public
aid
office
learns
the
valuable
lesson
that
any
federal
provision
under
the
social
security
act
that
is
mandatory
may
be
ignored
with
impunity.
that
savings
and
welfare
budgets
may
be
brought
about
by
violating
the
law
because
there
is
no
effective
sanction.
any
requirement
that
is
considered
onerous
or
unfair,
maybe
disregarded
because
there
is
no
sanction.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
for
example
with
respect
to
john
jordan,
he
was
entitled
to
benefits
for
november
and
december
1970.
position
there
were
taken
and
was
deprived
those
benefits,
and
according
to
the
law
of
illinois,
each
additional
month
they
would
have
delayed,
they
would
have
saved
the
state
share
of
payments
to
john
jordan.
so,
had
we
not
brought
this
suit
and
his
application
would
have
been
remained
non-acted
upon.
for
january,
for
february,
for
march,
the
state
would
have
saved
welfare
payments
for
each
of
those
months.
it
is
our
position
that
that
--
there
must
be
incentives
not
to
save
money
by
violating
the
law.
there
are
the
social
security
act,
provides
legitimate
means
for
the
states
to
control
the
expenditures
and
public
assistance
programs.
this
court
has
so
held
that
if
the
states
sets
its
own
standard
of
need
and
may
pay
less
than
the
full
percentage
of
need,
that
is
the
reasonable
--
that
is
the
legitimate
way
of
states
controlling
public
assistance
expenditures.
on
the
other
hand,
state
directors
of
public
aid,
must
need
some
incentives
to
pay
careful
attention
to
federal
requirements
whenever
they
are
enforcing,
whenever
they
are
adopting
their
regulations
in
taking
positions
in
the
social
security
act.
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
present
remedies
of
an
injunction
prospectively
only
is
not
a
deterrent,
and
certainly,
the
remedy
of
a
total
cutoff
of
federal
funds
is
not
a
deterrent.
it
is
only
the
remedy
of
restitution
that
provides
a
deterrent
and
conversely
provides
an
incentive
to
comply
with
federal
law.
we
would,
at
the
very
least
in
this
cooperative
scheme
of
federalism.
the
states
agree
to
comply
with
the
law.
that
is
the
central
condition
upon
which
the
federal
government
provides
to
the
states
billions
of
dollars.
states
agree
that
we
will
conform
to
federal
law,
and
that’s
their
only
part
of
the
bargain.
if
cooperative
federalism
is
to
work,
it
must
work
under
scheme
where
state
officers
respect
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
supremacy
of
federal
requirements.
if
there
is
not
--
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
on
the
grounds
of
the
remedy
of
restitution
was
inappropriate,
it
would
provide
a
valuable
lesson
to
state
law
officials
that
there
is
no
sanction
for
violating
the
law,
and
particularly
in
the
case,
given
the
established
facts
that
the
director
was
aware
that
his
--
that
the
owner
regulations
was
contrary
to
law.
there
is
no
basis
for
reversing
the
decision.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
your
honor,
that
--
that
is
one
of
the
equitable
considerations
that
the
court
would
take
into
account.
in
this
case,
i
would
point
out
that
in
fact,
the
director
does
not
argue
that
on
the
equities,
the
lower
court
abused
this
discretion.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
i
think
that
that’s
a
different
doctrine
than
the
one
that
--
mr.
sheldon
roodman
well,
if
the
court
would
--
that
argument
seems
to
be
that
yes,
we
knew
that
we
are
violating
the
law,
but
now
that
we
are
caught,
we
are
not
to
have
to
provide
the
statutory
entitlements
that
we
were
--
obligated
to
make
in
the
first
place
and
that
we
agree
to
make
in
the
first
place.
with
respect
to
the
question
--
answering
the
question
in
conclusion
with
respect
to
willful
violations
and
whether
hew
approved
it,
we
think
that’s
one
factor
that
the
court
would
consider.
but
of
course,
what
we
are
interested
in
is
deterring
violations
of
all
laws,
and
if
a
court
rules
that
a
state
provision
is
contrary
to
social
security
act
and
the
supremacy
clause,
we
must
remember
that
the
plaintiffs
then
are
being
deprived
to
this
work
deprived
of
their
statutory
entitlements,
and
all
that
of
remedy
or
restitution
does,
it
places
them
in
the
position
that
they
would
have
been
in
but
for
the
violation
of
law.
and
that’s
the
classic
goal
of
restitution.
thank
you.
