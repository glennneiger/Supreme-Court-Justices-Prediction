do
you
think
your
clients
could
bring
the
1983
action
for
damages
against
the
petitioner
here?
justice
william

rehnquist
i’m
thinking
not
so
much
of
the
eleventh
amendment
as
the
general
motion
that
an
agent
of
the
state,
though
he
may
be
enjoin
from
violating
the
constitution
is
ordinarily
not
thought
to
be
personally
liable
in
damages
for
his
action
probably
and
the
analogy
to
a
private
employee
of
a
private
employer.
justice

rehnquist
in
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren’t
those
tort
cases
though?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
so,
yes.
justice
william

(inaudible)
dispose
of
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
that
go
to
the
constitutional
claim
go
to
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
the
respondents
who
are
welfare
recipients
brought
a
class
action
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
seeking
injunctive
and
declaratory
against
the
illinois
officials
administering
the
federal
state
program
of
aid
to
the
aged,
blind
and
disabled.
the
respondent
contended
that
the
illinois
officials
were
violating
federal
law
and
denying
equal
protection
of
the
laws
by
following
state
regulations
that
did
not
comply
with
the
federal
time
limits,
within
which
participating
states
had
to
process
and
make
grants
with
respect
to
the
aabd
applications.
the
district
court
granted
a
permanent
injunction
requiring
compliance
with
the
federal
time
limits
and
also
ordered
the
state
officials
to
release
and
to
remit
benefits
wrongfully
withheld
to
all
persons
found
eligible
who
would
apply
for
the
benefits.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
rejecting
the
state
officials’
contentions
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bar
that
portion
of
the
award
which
amounted
to
retroactive
benefits,
and
the
judgment
of
inconsistency
between
federal
regulations
and
state
provisions
could
be
given
only
prospective
effect.
the
state
appealed
here
and
we
hold
today
that
the
eleventh
amendment
of
the
constitution
does
bar
that
portion
of
the
district
court’s
decree
that
ordered
retroactive
payment
of
benefits.
while
a
federal
court
may
give
prospective
injunctive
relief
against
the
state
official
under
the
rationale
of
ex
parte
young,
it
may
not
award
retroactive
payments
payable
from
public
funds
in
the
state
treasury
unless
the
state
has
consented
to
sue.
here
we
hold
that
the
state
of
illinois
did
not
waive
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
by
the
mere
fact
that
it
chose
to
participate
in
the
aabd
program,
which
is
partially
funded
by
the
federal
government.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
brennan
have
each
filed
dissenting
opinions.
mr.
