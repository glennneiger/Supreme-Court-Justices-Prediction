the
third
case,
number
72-1603,
cardwell
against
lewis.
this
comes
to
us
in
the
form
of
an
application
in
federal
habeas
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
july
1967,
almost
seven
years
ago,
the
body
of
a
man
named
radcliffe
was
found
near
his
car
on
the
banks
of
the
olentangy
river
in
delaware
county,
ohio.
the
car
had
gone
over
the
embankment
and
had
come
to
rest
in
brush.
radcliffe
had
died
from
shotgun
wounds.
the
police
made
casts
of
tire
tracks
at
the
scene
and
removed
foreign
paint
scrapings
from
the
fender
of
the
victim’s
automobile.
within
five
days
the
investigation
of
the
murder
began
to
focus
upon
respondent
lewis.
he
was
interviewed
but
nothing
definitive
developed
from
that
interview.
on
october
10th,
in
response
to
a
request,
lewis
appeared
at
the
division
of
criminal
activities
in
columbus
for
further
questioning.
he
drove
his
automobile
that
morning
to
downtown
columbus
and
parked
it
in
the
nearby
commercial
public
parking
lot.
earlier
the
police
had
obtained
a
warrant
for
lewis’
arrest,
but
did
not
seek
or
obtain
a
warrant
for
the
search
of
his
automobile.
the
interrogation
went
on
most
of
the
day
and
lewis
was
formerly
arrested
in
late
afternoon.
his
car
keys
were
turned
over
to
the
police
and
they
towed
the
automobile
from
the
parking
lot
to
the
police
impoundment
lot.
the
next
morning,
without
a
search
warrant,
examination
of
the
outside
of
the
car
revealed
that
one
of
its
operative
tires
matched
the
cast
of
the
impression
made
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
also
revealed
that
paint
samples
taken
from
lewis’
car
were
not
different
from
the
foreign
paint
on
the
fender
of
the
victim’s
car.
lewis
was
tried
for
murder
in
the
ohio
state
court
and
was
convicted.
on
appeal
his
conviction
was
affirmed
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
later
mr.
lewis
sought
a
writ
of
a
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court.
the
federal
district
court
concluded
that
the
seizure
of
the
automobile
in
examination
of
its
exterior
violated
lewis’
rights
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
that
the
evidence
obtained
from
the
examination
should
have
been
excluded
at
the
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
holding
that
the
scraping
of
the
paint
was
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that
the
search
was
not
incident
to
the
arrest,
and
that
the
car’s
seizure
could
not
be
justified
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
in
plain
view.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
a
plurality
opinion,
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joined,
four
of
us
conclude
that
the
examination
of
the
exterior
of
the
automobile
was
reasonable
and
invaded
no
right
of
privacy
that
the
requirement
of
a
search
warrant
was
meant
to
protect,
particularly
where
the
so-called
search
was
made
as
here
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
and
was
of
a
movable
automobile.
we
also
conclude
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
seizure,
by
impounding
the
car,
was
not
unreasonable.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
he
is
of
the
view
that
the
inquiry
of
a
federal
court
on
habeas
of
a
state
prisoner’s
fourth
amendment
claim
should
be
confined
solely
to
the
question
whether
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
in
the
state
courts
to
raise
his
claim
and
have
it
adjudicated
fairly
there.
thus,
he
would
reverse
the
judgment
because
mr.
lewis
does
not
contend
that
he
was
denied
that
opportunity.
there
is
a
dissent
which
will
be
announced.
