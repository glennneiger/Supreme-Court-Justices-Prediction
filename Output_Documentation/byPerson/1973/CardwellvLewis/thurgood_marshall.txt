justice
thurgood

how

justice
thurgood

and
there

justice
thurgood

they
couldn’t
have
stopped
the

justice
thurgood

for
about
15
minutes?
justice
thurgood

and
he
could’ve
sued

that
again?
justice
thurgood

so
that

horrible.
that
would
be
horrible,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood

without
the

justice
thurgood

i
thought
you
said
the
police
had
the
parking

justice
thurgood

mr.
campbell,
as
i
understand
the
position,
if
he’d
driven
that
car
and
left
it
outside
the
attorney
general’s
office
parking
lot,
could
they
stay
to
have
chipped
a
piece
of
that
paint
off
and
test
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir,
in
the
street
right
in
front
of
the
attorney
general’s
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
the
private
nature
of
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
was
the
bumper.
they
didn’t
go
--
assuming
they
didn’t
go
into
the
car
at
all,
assuming
they
didn’t
have
the
key.
all
they
knew
was
this
was
the
car
and
they
want
to
get
a
piece
of
that
paint
off
of
the
front
of
it.
so,
they
knocked
the
piece
of
the
paint
off.
what’s
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
would
go
for
things
in
plain
view?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
laying
on
the
front
of
the
bumper
was
a
can
of
paint,
could
you
seize
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
once
you
touch
the
bumper,
you
get
in
trouble?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that
solicitor
general’s
position
is
that
the
car,
there’s
no
question
of
going
into
or
violating
anything
to
just
chip
a
piece
of
paint
off
of
the
outside
of
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
wonder
if
you
could
take
it
a
little
further.
suppose
you’d
go
up
to
the
man’s
house
and
chip
a
piece
of

off
of
the
outside
door.
will
you
need
a

warrant?
justice
thurgood

why?
justice
thurgood

do
you
get
this
living
in
the
car
business?
justice
thurgood

you?
