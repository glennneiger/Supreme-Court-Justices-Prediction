mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
by
the
warrantless
seizure
of
respondent’s
car
and
the
removal
of
a
small
paint
sample
from
it
which
was
subsequently
introduced
and
evidenced
against
him
at
his
murder
trial.
now,
we
have
briefed
this
case
and
are
arguing
this
case
on
the
premise
that
there
was
indeed
opportunity
for
the
police
to
get
a
warrant
and
that
there
was
no
emergency
or
other
justification
for
they’re
not
doing
it
in
this
case.
we’re
advancing
the
contention
that
they
were
not
required
to
get
a
warrant
to
do
what
they
did
in
this
case.
now,
we’re
dealing
here
as
in
almost
every
case
in
which
the
issue
focuses
on
the
warrant
requirement.
with
police
action,
that
can’t
be
deemed
unreasonable
in
the
normal
sense
of
the
word,
since
if
it
were
unreasonable
in
that
sense,
no
warrant
could
issue
to
authorize
the
action
that
they
did.
so,
was
it
unreasonable
here
for
the
ohio
law
enforcement
officers
knowing
the
facts
that
my
colleague
has
just
recited
to
you
to
believe
that
respondent’s
automobile
should
be
seized
and
examined
for
evidence
that
they
had
every
expectation
of
finding
and
it
would
be
highly
probative
at
his
anticipated
murder
trial?
obviously
not.
similarly,
was
it
unreasonable
of
them
to
remove
a
paint
sample
from
respondent’s
car
to
compare
it
with
the
foreign
paint
found
on
the
car
of
the
deceased?
surely,
a
failure
to
pursue
such
a
line
of
inquiry
would’ve
been
not
just
unreasonable,
but
grounds
for
dismissal
for
gross
incompetence.
so
why,
since
respondent
was
constitutionally
protected
only
from
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure,
are
we
here
today?
it’s
because
this
court
has
determined
that,
in
many
circumstances,
the
kind
of
reasonableness
that
i’ve
been
talking
about
is
not
enough.
but
there’s
an
overriding
policy
favoring
antecedent
judicial
determinations
of
reasonableness
and
the
issuance
of
warrants
authorizing
searches
and
seizures
before
certain
kinds
of
police
intrusions
into
the
affairs
of
the
citizen
will
be
countenanced.
now,
in
many
cases,
this
policy
has
been
expressed
in
terms
of
a
per
se
rule
of
presumptive
unreasonableness
of
warrantless
seizures.
accompanied,
however,
by
a
collection
of
exceptions,
each
of
which
has
its
own
rational,
but
which,
taken
together,
leave
a
substantial
area
of
uncertainty
today
185
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment
about
when
a
warrant
is
required.
we
suggest
that
there
is
a
sound
underlying
rational
that
runs
through
the
court’s
efforts
in
this
area
that
a
meaningful
understanding
of
the
unifying
principles
is
beclouded
by
thinking
in
terms
of
a
pro
se
--
per
se
warrant
requirement
with
a
--
what
i
might
call
a
procrustean
hotel
of
exceptions.
this
approach
tends
to
lead
the
court
into
the
inquiry
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
get
a
warrant
rather
than
whether
the
search
should
be
considered
reasonable.
although
as
the
court
stated
in
cooper
against
california,
the
latter
is
the
constitutionally
relevant
standard.
now,
to
identify
this
unifying
rational
one
must
ask,
why
would
the
court
ever
call
a
concededly
reasonable
search
unreasonable
because
of
the
absence
of
a
warrant?
it
can
only
be
because
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
it
is
simply
not
tolerable
for
the
police
to
act
without
a
prior
evaluation
of
their
reasons
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
so,
we
urge
the
court
today
to
adopt
the
functional
analysis
of
the
warrant
requirement.
the
per
se
rule
which
says
that
the
search
is
unreasonable
without
a
warrant
makes
sense
when
we’re
talking
about
searches
of
houses,
as
was
eloquently
stated
in
the
johnson
and
the
mcdonald
cases.
it
makes
sense
when
we’re
talking
about
intercepting
conversations
or
intercepting
mail
where
substantial
privacy
expectations
are
being
defeated.
this
point
was
emphasized
in
katz.
does
it
make
sense,
however,
in
the
case
of
the
automobile?
now,
i
suggest
that
it
is
more
than
just
a
freakish
coincidence
that
this
court
has
never,
insofar
as
i’m
aware,
struck
down
a
warrantless
probable
cause
search
of
an
automobile
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
coolidge
case
and
in
coolidge,
there
was
critical
extra
ingredient,
the
intrusion
on
to
mr.
coolidge’s
private
property.
now,
the
reason
for
this
goes
back
to
the
real
values
that
underlie
the
fourth
amendment
protections
which
were
stated
by
justice
brennan
in
warden
against
hayden,
page
304
of
387
u.s.
he
said
“the
premise
that
property
interest
control
the
right
of
the
government
to
search
and
seize
has
been
discredited.”
we
have
recognized
that
the
principle
object
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
protection
of
privacy
rather
than
property
and
have
increasingly
discarded
fictional
and
procedural
barriers
rested
on
property
considerations.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
whether
a
search
or
seizure
without
a
warrant
should
be
held
per
se
unreasonable
depends
on
a
determination
of
whether
the
privacy
interest
at
stake
is
of
such
magnitude
that
the
interposition
of
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
should
be
required
to
make
the
probable
cause
determination.
now,
in
approaching
this
analysis,
i
think
the
principal
distinction
that
we
would
draw
is
the
distinction
between
searches
and
seizures.
while
like
the
admiral
in
hms
pinafore,
i’m
not
sure
that
i’m
prepared
to
say
never,
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
a
situation
in
which
a
seizure,
as
such,
should
require
a
warrant
if
it
is
otherwise
reasonable
as
distinct
from
a
search
because
when
we’re
talking
about
a
seizure,
we’re
talking
about
an
invasion
of
the
individual’s
property
interest
only.
a
search,
on
the
other
hand,
does
involve,
almost
by
definition,
some
kind
of
intrusion
into
his
privacy
interest.
in
the
area
of
searches,
therefore,
i
think
the
court
ought
to
weigh
what
privacy
interests
are
at
stake?
are
these
privacy
interest
are
such
that
in
determining
whether
the
search
is
reasonable
under
the
first
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
court
will
impose
the
warrant
requirements.
now,
the
per
se
approach,
i
think,
leads
to
some
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
it
recognized
also
in
katz
that
property
interests
too
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
i’m
not
--
my
argument
is
really
addressed
to
the
case
as
here
where
the
infringement
is
on
property
interests
of
the
citizen.
my
suggestion
is
that
while
those
property
interests
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
they
are
protected
by
the
reasonableness
requirement
and
they
ought
not
--
they
don’t
need
the
additional
protection
of
the
per
se
warrant
rule
which
this
court
has
spoken
about,
but
has
frequently
declined
to
apply
in
cases
where
it
clearly
seemed
improper
to
deem
a
search
unreasonable
because
there
was
no
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true,
although
i
think
our
argument
--
that
consideration
is
a
consideration
which
distinguishes
coolidge
from
this
case
in
two
respects.
in
coolidge
they
intruded
onto
his
private
property,
and
in
coolidge
they
went
into
the
body
of
his
car
to
remove
dust
and
sweepings
from
the
floor
of
the
car.
what
i’m
suggesting,
however,
is
a
general
approach
to
this
problem
which
has
come
up
so
many
times
and
where
it’s
difficult
to
perceive
a
unifying
threat
of
analysis.
and
i’m
suggesting
that
what
early
motivates
the
court
ordinarily
is
that
they
see
in
some
instances
the
kind
of
intrusion
into
privacy
as
in
katz,
which
the
court
is
simply
not
prepared
to
allow
the
police
to
do
just
on
the
basis
of
their
own
reasons
for
doing
so
even
if
those
reasons
are
subsequently
found
to
have
been
sufficient.
now,
in
the
--
in
our
brief
we
discussed
the
white
case
which
the
sixth
circuit
decided
some
months
after
they
decided
cardwell.
now,
in
the
white
case,
the
defendant
have
been
arrested
for
passing
counterfeit
currency
and
they
located
his
car
which
presumably,
if
in
fact
the
reasons
that
they
had
to
believe
that
he
had
used
it
to
transport
counterfeit
currency
were
valid
would
be
subject
to
forfeiture.
they
went
into
the
glove
compartment
of
his
car
and
they
found
there
other
counterfeit
currency
which
was
introduced
in
evidence
against
him
at
his
trial.
now
the
court
of
appeals,
instead
of
looking
at
what
it
was
that
the
police
were
doing
and
looking
at
what
the
privacy
interests
of
the
citizen
were
that
were
at
stake
as
they
did
not
do
in
the
cardwell
case
either,
the
court
of
appeals
says
“well,
he
went
in
for
some
purpose
other
than
looking
for
evidence
of
a
crime
so
that
it’s
alright
for
him
to
do
the
very
same
act.”
now,
i
would
suggest
that,
for
instance,
in
cady
against
dombrowski
where
a
somewhat
similar
rational
was
utilized
that
had
they
known
that
the
gun
or
believed
reasonably
that
the
gun
was
used
in
a
murder,
that
should
not
detract
from
the
right
from
which
this
court
recognize
them
to
have
to
go
into
the
car
without
a
warrant
in
order
to
seize
the
gun.
if
it
does,
i
think
it
inverts
the
--
what
seems
to
me
to
make
sense
or
be
reasonable
in
the
sense
that
the
term
was
used
in
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
i’d
like
to
address
a
comment
briefly
to
the
almeida-sanchez
case
to
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
because
there,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
a
search
on
less
than
probable
cause
might
be
deemed
nevertheless
reasonable.
and
i
think,
there,
the
--
it
was
the
absence
of
probable
cause
which
made
it
necessary
to
seek
a
warrant
as
a
means
in
effect
of
reinforcing
the
reasonableness
in
the
normal
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
for
the
police
to
make
this
intrusion
on
citizens
driving
along
the
road
near
the
boarder.
had
there
been
probable
cause,
i
don’t
think
the
per
se
warrant
requirement
would’ve
been
necessary
or
properly
applicable.
now,
we
also
mentioned
in
our
brief
some
of
the
historical
factors
that
are
in
the
background
and
i
think
these
are
some
of
the
same
factors
that
justice
douglas
discussed
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
matlock,
although
we
read
them
to
have
a
different
impact
on
this
case.
now,
we
recognize
the
court
is
not
bound
strictly
by
the
understanding
of
the
framers
in
drafting
the
fourth
amendment.
in
some
sense,
the
constitution
is
a
living
instrument
and
we’re
not
suggesting
that
it
should
be
narrowly
constraint
to
18th
century
circumstances.
however,
we
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
concern
was
with
the
kind
of
invasion
privacy
that’s
detailed
in
going
into
a
dwelling
that
the
general
warrant
concern
was
with
going
into
the
man’s
house.
and
we
think
that
the
statute
of
1815,
which
was
cited
in
the
carol
case
and
which
is
one
illustration
of
early
congressional
understanding
of
the
restriction
on
searches
and
seizures
is
very
significant.
this
was
a
statute
which
permitted
custom's
search
that’s
not
just
at
the
border,
but
any
place
within
the
custom’s
district
and
had
made
a
distinction
between
going
into
a
house
and
searching
a
vehicle
or
vessel
or
beast.
in
the
latter
case,
not
only
did
it
provide
that
search
could
be
made
on
mere
suspicion
and,
as
distinct
from
the
warrant
requirement
for
searching
in
a
house,
but
it
had
a
proviso
which
chief
justice
taft
did
not
quote
in
the
carol
opinion
but
which
we
think
is
significant.
it’s
quoted
at
page
27
of
our
brief
and
it
said
“provided
always
that
the
necessity
of
a
search
warrant
arising
under
this
act
shall,
in
no
case,
be
considered
as
applicable
to
any
carriage,
wagon,
cart,
sleigh,
vessel,
boat,
or
other
vehicle
of
whatever
form
of
construction
employed
as
a
medium
of
transportation
or
the
packages
on
any
animal
or
animals
or
carried
by
man
or
on
foot.”
and
that
statute
was
signed
into
law
by
the
father
of
the
fourth
amendment,
james
madison.
and,
i
think
it
sheds
some
significant
light
on
the
understanding
of
the
framers
with
regard
to
the
fourth
amendment.
so,
to
sum
up,
we
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
seizure
of
the
car
and
the
removal
of
a
piece
of
paint
from
the
car
constituted
seizures
and
not
searches
and
that
the
court
should
recognize,
as
we
think
sound
analysis
compels,
that
a
seizure
does
not,
ordinarily
barring
some
exceptional
circumstances
not
present
here,
have
to
require
the
antecedent
justification
of
a
warrant
in
order
to
be
reasonable,
but
rather
its
reasonableness
can
be
assessed
on
the
basis
of
what
the
police
officers
knew,
what
justification
they
had
for
going
and
doing
what
they
did.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
they
had
every
justification
for
doing
it.
if
there
are
no
questions?
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
a
couple
of
factual
matters
with
respect
to
the
question
of
when
they
knew
that
the
car
was
parked
on
the
lot.
at
page
61a
of
the
appendix
there
is
testimony
by
the
witness
that
they
did
not
know
during
the
day
that
the
parked
on
that
particular
lot.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
they
learned
of
it
at
the
time
that
the
arrest
took
place
and
they
obtained
the
claim
check
for
that
parking
lot.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
could’ve
asked.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
could’ve
asked
at
10
o’clock
yes.
also,
apparently,
it
was
stipulated
by
mr.
scott,
lewis’
attorney,
that
the
testimony
of
clyde
mann
was
supported
by
the
full
transcript
of
the
tape
proceedings
which
he
had
been
furnished
by
the
prosecutor.
now,
the
consent
argument
which
was
discussed,
our
argument
on
the
consent
issue
is
that
the
district
court
never
resolved
the
question
of
whether
mr.
lewis
consented
to
the
seizure
of
his
automobile
because
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
not
relevant
since
he
did
not
consent
to
the
search
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
taking
of
the
paint
samples
was
a
search.
in
our
brief,
i
think
at
page
20,
we
make
the
point
that
if
the
court
finds
that
the
taking
of
the
paint
samples
was
not
a
search,
then
assuming
even
that
the
court
held
that
a
warrant
would
be
required
for
the
seizure
there
appears
to
be
a
factual
issue
left
unresolved
by
the
district
court
here
as
to
whether
there
was
consent
to
the
seizure
as
distinct
from
the
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
was
no
finding
with
consent.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
that’s
right.
now,
we
suggest
that
taking
the
paint
chips
from
the
car
without
seizure
would
not
have
required
a
warrant.
when
we
say
this,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
automobiles
or
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
taking
of
paint
chips.
we
are
saying
that
the
warrant
requirement
that
that
court
has
adopted
as
attached
to
the
reasonableness
standard
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
what
doesn’t
apply
here.
now,
we
have
not
depicted
arbitrarily
between
two
clauses
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
said
“well,
he
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
reasonableness
cause,
but
not
the
benefit
of
the
warrant
clause.”
the
warrant
clause
by
its
terms
is
not
applicable
here.
the
warrant
clause
only
becomes
applicable
if
the
court
presumes
the
search
to
be
unreasonable
without
a
warrant.
he,
of
course,
is
always
entitled
to
the
reasonableness
protection,
assuming
that
the
nature
of
the
action
is
either
a
search
or
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i’m
advised
by
one
of
my
colleagues
with
reference
to
justice
stewart’s
question
about
the
key
to
the
locker
that
there’s
a
case
before
the
court
now
on
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
fifth
circuit,
united
states
against
grill,
in
which,
key
was
taken
from
the
petitioner
upon
his
being
jailed
and
the
police
learned
of
a
duffel
bag
which
the
key
fit
from
a
confederate
who
indicated
that
it
contained
evidence
of
a
cocaine
importation
conspiracy.
they
went
to
the
duffel
bag
and
they
opened
it
up,
and
found
the
evidence
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
they
were
not
required
to
obtain
a
warrant
in
that
situation.
now,
we
have
not
yet
responded
to
that
certiorari
petition,
but
i
think
in
the
pawnshop
illustration
there
would
be
a
lesser
policy
of
privacy.
if
he
turns
his
gun
over
to
the
pawnshop,
i
don’t
see
that
there’s
the
kind
of
interest
there
that
would
require
more
than
a
finding
of
reasonableness
of
police
action
in
going
to
the
pawnshop
and
seizing
the
gun.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
by
the
warrantless
seizure
of
respondent’s
car
and
the
removal
of
a
small
paint
sample
from
it
which
was
subsequently
introduced
and
evidenced
against
him
at
his
murder
trial.
now,
we
have
briefed
this
case
and
are
arguing
this
case
on
the
premise
that
there
was
indeed
opportunity
for
the
police
to
get
a
warrant
and
that
there
was
no
emergency
or
other
justification
for
they’re
not
doing
it
in
this
case.
we’re
advancing
the
contention
that
they
were
not
required
to
get
a
warrant
to
do
what
they
did
in
this
case.
now,
we’re
dealing
here
as
in
almost
every
case
in
which
the
issue
focuses
on
the
warrant
requirement.
with
police
action,
that
can’t
be
deemed
unreasonable
in
the
normal
sense
of
the
word,
since
if
it
were
unreasonable
in
that
sense,
no
warrant
could
issue
to
authorize
the
action
that
they
did.
so,
was
it
unreasonable
here
for
the
ohio
law
enforcement
officers
knowing
the
facts
that
my
colleague
has
just
recited
to
you
to
believe
that
respondent’s
automobile
should
be
seized
and
examined
for
evidence
that
they
had
every
expectation
of
finding
and
it
would
be
highly
probative
at
his
anticipated
murder
trial?
obviously
not.
similarly,
was
it
unreasonable
of
them
to
remove
a
paint
sample
from
respondent’s
car
to
compare
it
with
the
foreign
paint
found
on
the
car
of
the
deceased?
surely,
a
failure
to
pursue
such
a
line
of
inquiry
would’ve
been
not
just
unreasonable,
but
grounds
for
dismissal
for
gross
incompetence.
so
why,
since
respondent
was
constitutionally
protected
only
from
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure,
are
we
here
today?
it’s
because
this
court
has
determined
that,
in
many
circumstances,
the
kind
of
reasonableness
that
i’ve
been
talking
about
is
not
enough.
but
there’s
an
overriding
policy
favoring
antecedent
judicial
determinations
of
reasonableness
and
the
issuance
of
warrants
authorizing
searches
and
seizures
before
certain
kinds
of
police
intrusions
into
the
affairs
of
the
citizen
will
be
countenanced.
now,
in
many
cases,
this
policy
has
been
expressed
in
terms
of
a
per
se
rule
of
presumptive
unreasonableness
of
warrantless
seizures.
accompanied,
however,
by
a
collection
of
exceptions,
each
of
which
has
its
own
rational,
but
which,
taken
together,
leave
a
substantial
area
of
uncertainty
today
185
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment
about
when
a
warrant
is
required.
we
suggest
that
there
is
a
sound
underlying
rational
that
runs
through
the
court’s
efforts
in
this
area
that
a
meaningful
understanding
of
the
unifying
principles
is
beclouded
by
thinking
in
terms
of
a
pro
se
--
per
se
warrant
requirement
with
a
--
what
i
might
call
a
procrustean
hotel
of
exceptions.
this
approach
tends
to
lead
the
court
into
the
inquiry
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
get
a
warrant
rather
than
whether
the
search
should
be
considered
reasonable.
although
as
the
court
stated
in
cooper
against
california,
the
latter
is
the
constitutionally
relevant
standard.
now,
to
identify
this
unifying
rational
one
must
ask,
why
would
the
court
ever
call
a
concededly
reasonable
search
unreasonable
because
of
the
absence
of
a
warrant?
it
can
only
be
because
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
it
is
simply
not
tolerable
for
the
police
to
act
without
a
prior
evaluation
of
their
reasons
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
so,
we
urge
the
court
today
to
adopt
the
functional
analysis
of
the
warrant
requirement.
the
per
se
rule
which
says
that
the
search
is
unreasonable
without
a
warrant
makes
sense
when
we’re
talking
about
searches
of
houses,
as
was
eloquently
stated
in
the
johnson
and
the
mcdonald
cases.
it
makes
sense
when
we’re
talking
about
intercepting
conversations
or
intercepting
mail
where
substantial
privacy
expectations
are
being
defeated.
this
point
was
emphasized
in
katz.
does
it
make
sense,
however,
in
the
case
of
the
automobile?
now,
i
suggest
that
it
is
more
than
just
a
freakish
coincidence
that
this
court
has
never,
insofar
as
i’m
aware,
struck
down
a
warrantless
probable
cause
search
of
an
automobile
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
coolidge
case
and
in
coolidge,
there
was
critical
extra
ingredient,
the
intrusion
on
to
mr.
coolidge’s
private
property.
now,
the
reason
for
this
goes
back
to
the
real
values
that
underlie
the
fourth
amendment
protections
which
were
stated
by
justice
brennan
in
warden
against
hayden,
page
304
of
387
u.s.
he
said
“the
premise
that
property
interest
control
the
right
of
the
government
to
search
and
seize
has
been
discredited.”
we
have
recognized
that
the
principle
object
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
protection
of
privacy
rather
than
property
and
have
increasingly
discarded
fictional
and
procedural
barriers
rested
on
property
considerations.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
whether
a
search
or
seizure
without
a
warrant
should
be
held
per
se
unreasonable
depends
on
a
determination
of
whether
the
privacy
interest
at
stake
is
of
such
magnitude
that
the
interposition
of
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
should
be
required
to
make
the
probable
cause
determination.
now,
in
approaching
this
analysis,
i
think
the
principal
distinction
that
we
would
draw
is
the
distinction
between
searches
and
seizures.
while
like
the
admiral
in
hms
pinafore,
i’m
not
sure
that
i’m
prepared
to
say
never,
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
a
situation
in
which
a
seizure,
as
such,
should
require
a
warrant
if
it
is
otherwise
reasonable
as
distinct
from
a
search
because
when
we’re
talking
about
a
seizure,
we’re
talking
about
an
invasion
of
the
individual’s
property
interest
only.
a
search,
on
the
other
hand,
does
involve,
almost
by
definition,
some
kind
of
intrusion
into
his
privacy
interest.
in
the
area
of
searches,
therefore,
i
think
the
court
ought
to
weigh
what
privacy
interests
are
at
stake?
are
these
privacy
interest
are
such
that
in
determining
whether
the
search
is
reasonable
under
the
first
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
court
will
impose
the
warrant
requirements.
now,
the
per
se
approach,
i
think,
leads
to
some
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
it
recognized
also
in
katz
that
property
interests
too
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
i’m
not
--
my
argument
is
really
addressed
to
the
case
as
here
where
the
infringement
is
on
property
interests
of
the
citizen.
my
suggestion
is
that
while
those
property
interests
are
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
they
are
protected
by
the
reasonableness
requirement
and
they
ought
not
--
they
don’t
need
the
additional
protection
of
the
per
se
warrant
rule
which
this
court
has
spoken
about,
but
has
frequently
declined
to
apply
in
cases
where
it
clearly
seemed
improper
to
deem
a
search
unreasonable
because
there
was
no
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true,
although
i
think
our
argument
--
that
consideration
is
a
consideration
which
distinguishes
coolidge
from
this
case
in
two
respects.
in
coolidge
they
intruded
onto
his
private
property,
and
in
coolidge
they
went
into
the
body
of
his
car
to
remove
dust
and
sweepings
from
the
floor
of
the
car.
what
i’m
suggesting,
however,
is
a
general
approach
to
this
problem
which
has
come
up
so
many
times
and
where
it’s
difficult
to
perceive
a
unifying
threat
of
analysis.
and
i’m
suggesting
that
what
early
motivates
the
court
ordinarily
is
that
they
see
in
some
instances
the
kind
of
intrusion
into
privacy
as
in
katz,
which
the
court
is
simply
not
prepared
to
allow
the
police
to
do
just
on
the
basis
of
their
own
reasons
for
doing
so
even
if
those
reasons
are
subsequently
found
to
have
been
sufficient.
now,
in
the
--
in
our
brief
we
discussed
the
white
case
which
the
sixth
circuit
decided
some
months
after
they
decided
cardwell.
now,
in
the
white
case,
the
defendant
have
been
arrested
for
passing
counterfeit
currency
and
they
located
his
car
which
presumably,
if
in
fact
the
reasons
that
they
had
to
believe
that
he
had
used
it
to
transport
counterfeit
currency
were
valid
would
be
subject
to
forfeiture.
they
went
into
the
glove
compartment
of
his
car
and
they
found
there
other
counterfeit
currency
which
was
introduced
in
evidence
against
him
at
his
trial.
now
the
court
of
appeals,
instead
of
looking
at
what
it
was
that
the
police
were
doing
and
looking
at
what
the
privacy
interests
of
the
citizen
were
that
were
at
stake
as
they
did
not
do
in
the
cardwell
case
either,
the
court
of
appeals
says
“well,
he
went
in
for
some
purpose
other
than
looking
for
evidence
of
a
crime
so
that
it’s
alright
for
him
to
do
the
very
same
act.”
now,
i
would
suggest
that,
for
instance,
in
cady
against
dombrowski
where
a
somewhat
similar
rational
was
utilized
that
had
they
known
that
the
gun
or
believed
reasonably
that
the
gun
was
used
in
a
murder,
that
should
not
detract
from
the
right
from
which
this
court
recognize
them
to
have
to
go
into
the
car
without
a
warrant
in
order
to
seize
the
gun.
if
it
does,
i
think
it
inverts
the
--
what
seems
to
me
to
make
sense
or
be
reasonable
in
the
sense
that
the
term
was
used
in
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
i’d
like
to
address
a
comment
briefly
to
the
almeida-sanchez
case
to
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
because
there,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
a
search
on
less
than
probable
cause
might
be
deemed
nevertheless
reasonable.
and
i
think,
there,
the
--
it
was
the
absence
of
probable
cause
which
made
it
necessary
to
seek
a
warrant
as
a
means
in
effect
of
reinforcing
the
reasonableness
in
the
normal
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
for
the
police
to
make
this
intrusion
on
citizens
driving
along
the
road
near
the
boarder.
had
there
been
probable
cause,
i
don’t
think
the
per
se
warrant
requirement
would’ve
been
necessary
or
properly
applicable.
now,
we
also
mentioned
in
our
brief
some
of
the
historical
factors
that
are
in
the
background
and
i
think
these
are
some
of
the
same
factors
that
justice
douglas
discussed
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
matlock,
although
we
read
them
to
have
a
different
impact
on
this
case.
now,
we
recognize
the
court
is
not
bound
strictly
by
the
understanding
of
the
framers
in
drafting
the
fourth
amendment.
in
some
sense,
the
constitution
is
a
living
instrument
and
we’re
not
suggesting
that
it
should
be
narrowly
constraint
to
18th
century
circumstances.
however,
we
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
concern
was
with
the
kind
of
invasion
privacy
that’s
detailed
in
going
into
a
dwelling
that
the
general
warrant
concern
was
with
going
into
the
man’s
house.
and
we
think
that
the
statute
of
1815,
which
was
cited
in
the
carol
case
and
which
is
one
illustration
of
early
congressional
understanding
of
the
restriction
on
searches
and
seizures
is
very
significant.
this
was
a
statute
which
permitted
custom's
search
that’s
not
just
at
the
border,
but
any
place
within
the
custom’s
district
and
had
made
a
distinction
between
going
into
a
house
and
searching
a
vehicle
or
vessel
or
beast.
in
the
latter
case,
not
only
did
it
provide
that
search
could
be
made
on
mere
suspicion
and,
as
distinct
from
the
warrant
requirement
for
searching
in
a
house,
but
it
had
a
proviso
which
chief
justice
taft
did
not
quote
in
the
carol
opinion
but
which
we
think
is
significant.
it’s
quoted
at
page
27
of
our
brief
and
it
said
“provided
always
that
the
necessity
of
a
search
warrant
arising
under
this
act
shall,
in
no
case,
be
considered
as
applicable
to
any
carriage,
wagon,
cart,
sleigh,
vessel,
boat,
or
other
vehicle
of
whatever
form
of
construction
employed
as
a
medium
of
transportation
or
the
packages
on
any
animal
or
animals
or
carried
by
man
or
on
foot.”
and
that
statute
was
signed
into
law
by
the
father
of
the
fourth
amendment,
james
madison.
and,
i
think
it
sheds
some
significant
light
on
the
understanding
of
the
framers
with
regard
to
the
fourth
amendment.
so,
to
sum
up,
we
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
seizure
of
the
car
and
the
removal
of
a
piece
of
paint
from
the
car
constituted
seizures
and
not
searches
and
that
the
court
should
recognize,
as
we
think
sound
analysis
compels,
that
a
seizure
does
not,
ordinarily
barring
some
exceptional
circumstances
not
present
here,
have
to
require
the
antecedent
justification
of
a
warrant
in
order
to
be
reasonable,
but
rather
its
reasonableness
can
be
assessed
on
the
basis
of
what
the
police
officers
knew,
what
justification
they
had
for
going
and
doing
what
they
did.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
they
had
every
justification
for
doing
it.
if
there
are
no
questions?
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
a
couple
of
factual
matters
with
respect
to
the
question
of
when
they
knew
that
the
car
was
parked
on
the
lot.
at
page
61a
of
the
appendix
there
is
testimony
by
the
witness
that
they
did
not
know
during
the
day
that
the
parked
on
that
particular
lot.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
they
learned
of
it
at
the
time
that
the
arrest
took
place
and
they
obtained
the
claim
check
for
that
parking
lot.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
could’ve
asked.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
could’ve
asked
at
10
o’clock
yes.
also,
apparently,
it
was
stipulated
by
mr.
scott,
lewis’
attorney,
that
the
testimony
of
clyde
mann
was
supported
by
the
full
transcript
of
the
tape
proceedings
which
he
had
been
furnished
by
the
prosecutor.
now,
the
consent
argument
which
was
discussed,
our
argument
on
the
consent
issue
is
that
the
district
court
never
resolved
the
question
of
whether
mr.
lewis
consented
to
the
seizure
of
his
automobile
because
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
not
relevant
since
he
did
not
consent
to
the
search
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
taking
of
the
paint
samples
was
a
search.
in
our
brief,
i
think
at
page
20,
we
make
the
point
that
if
the
court
finds
that
the
taking
of
the
paint
samples
was
not
a
search,
then
assuming
even
that
the
court
held
that
a
warrant
would
be
required
for
the
seizure
there
appears
to
be
a
factual
issue
left
unresolved
by
the
district
court
here
as
to
whether
there
was
consent
to
the
seizure
as
distinct
from
the
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
was
no
finding

mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
that’s
right.
now,
we
suggest
that
taking
the
paint
chips
from
the
car
without
seizure
would
not
have
required
a
warrant.
when
we
say
this,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
automobiles
or
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
taking
of
paint
chips.
we
are
saying
that
the
warrant
requirement
that
that
court
has
adopted
as
attached
to
the
reasonableness
standard
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
what
doesn’t
apply
here.
now,
we
have
not
depicted
arbitrarily
between
two
clauses
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
said
“well,
he
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
reasonableness
cause,
but
not
the
benefit
of
the
warrant
clause.”
the
warrant
clause
by
its
terms
is
not
applicable
here.
the
warrant
clause
only
becomes
applicable
if
the
court
presumes
the
search
to
be
unreasonable
without
a
warrant.
he,
of
course,
is
always
entitled
to
the
reasonableness
protection,
assuming
that
the
nature
of
the
action
is
either
a
search
or
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i’m
advised
by
one
of
my
colleagues
with
reference
to
justice
stewart’s
question
about
the
key
to
the
locker
that
there’s
a
case
before
the
court
now
on
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
fifth
circuit,
united
states
against
grill,
in
which,
key
was
taken
from
the
petitioner
upon
his
being
jailed
and
the
police
learned
of
a
duffel
bag
which
the
key
fit
from
a
confederate
who
indicated
that
it
contained
evidence
of
a
cocaine
importation
conspiracy.
they
went
to
the
duffel
bag
and
they
opened
it
up,
and
found
the
evidence
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
they
were
not
required
to
obtain
a
warrant
in
that
situation.
now,
we
have
not
yet
responded
to
that
certiorari
petition,
but
i
think
in
the
pawnshop
illustration
there
would
be
a
lesser
policy
of
privacy.
if
he
turns
his
gun
over
to
the
pawnshop,
i
don’t
see
that
there’s
the
kind
of
interest
there
that
would
require
more
than
a
finding
of
reasonableness
of
police
action
in
going
to
the
pawnshop
and
seizing
the
gun.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
