justice
potter
stewart
who
issued
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
servable
anywhere
in
the
state,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
it
was
served
you
say
by
a
--
not
a
common
police
judge.
the
warrant
was
not
issued
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
a
municipal
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
campbell,
do
you
understand
that,
here,
in
this
argument
in
this
court,
that
either
mr.
conway
or
mr.
frey
are
relying
on
consent?
is
there
a
theory
that
this
is
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
perhaps
missed
it.
i
misunderstood
it.
i
didn’t
understand
that
they
--
there’s
any
reliance
on
consent
as
such
here
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
holding
is
against
him
in
both
of
the
federal
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn’t
understand
that
that
was
being
attacked?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
campbell,
how
about
the
--
and
maybe
there
have
been
cases
of
this
kind,
i
don’t
have
any
in
mind.
let’s
assume
a
constitutionally
valid
arrest
and,
therefore,
a
--
the
search
incident
there,
too,
was
a
constitutionally
valid
search.
assume
further
that
in
the
process
of
that
search,
there
was
found
in
the
pocket
of
the
arrestee
a
key
with
a
number
on
it
to
a
locker
down
at
the
union
station.
the
police
have
to
get
a
search
warrant
to
search
the
locker
or
may
they
simply
use
the
key
and
go
down
to
the
union
station
and
open
up
the
locker?
are
there
any
cases
to
that
kind?
justice
potter
stewart
not
either.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
very
close
in
that.
justice
potter
stewart
analytically,
anyway,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
if
the
police
had
the
key
perfectly
lawfully,
as
by
the
hypothesis
of
my
hypothetical
question
they
do,
why
they
can’t
they
simply
use
the
key?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lewis
was
there
in
the
office
of
the
special
branch
of
the
attorney
general’s
office
most
of
the
day,
wasn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
back
in
delaware
county
which
is
a
contiguous
county?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
any
event,
for
six
or
seven
hours,
is
there
anything
that
we
know
as
to
what
occurred
during
that
long
period
of
time?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
--
do
we
have
a
transcript
of
what
occurred
there
for
that
whole
period
from
10:00
a.m.
until
5:30
p.m.
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
the
exception
of
that
period
that
he
went
back
to
his
house?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you’re
just
starting
to
tell
us
now
that
nothing
emerged
from
that
interrogation
or
that
discussion
that
was
any
different
with
the
exception
of
one
minor
change
in
his
version
of
something.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
be
an
interesting
analogy
if
this
were
a
search
inside
the
automobile,
but
this
is
not
quite
that
and
the
government
makes
a
good
deal
of
that
and,
i
guess,
mr.
conway
does
too.
there
is
no
entry
to
the
automobile?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
are
analogizing
it
to
a
dwelling
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
entry
into
it.
it
was
simply
scraping
something
off
of
the
bumper
or
the
front
fender,
or
whatever
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
didn’t
live
--
he
may
have
lived
in
his
automobile,
but
he
didn’t
live
sitting
on
the
bumper,
that’s
the
point?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
quite
understand
what
you
mean
by
prospective
or
retrospective
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
douglas,
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
respectfully
dissent
from
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
in
this
case.
the
most
fundamental
rule
in
this
area
of
constitutional
law
is
that
searches
and
seizures
conducted
outside
the
judicial
process,
i.e.,
without
a
warrant
issued
by
a
judge
or
a
magistrate
are
unconstitutional,
subject
only
to
a
few
specifically
established
and
well-delineated
exceptions.
since
there
was
no
warrant
authorizing
the
seizure
or
the
search
in
this
case
and
since
none
of
the
specifically
established
and
well-delineated
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
existed
on
the
facts
of
this
record,
we
are
convinced
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
we
would
follow
the
settled
constitutional
law
established
in
our
previous
decisions
and
accordingly
we
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
our
views
are
more
fully
set
for
out
in
the
written
dissenting
opinion
that
i
