you’re
talking
in
terms
of
privacy,
but
the
court
in
katz
did
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
can’t
be
translated
into
a
general
constitutional
right
to
privacy,
isn’t
it?

mr.
campbell,
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
a
number
of
cases
of
this
court,
carol
and
chambers
and
cady,
have
said
that
a
car
is
quite
different
for
a
fourth
amendment
purposes
than
a
man’s
home.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn’t,
i
realize,
answer
the
question
you’re
addressing
yourself
to,
whether
conceding
that
difference,
it
still
has
fourth
amendment
protection.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
a
motorcycle
is
tantamount
to
a
car
for
purposes
of
your
argument?

how
about
