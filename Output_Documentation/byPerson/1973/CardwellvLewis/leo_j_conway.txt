mr.
leo
j.
conway
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
seek
a
review
of
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio,
eastern
division,
issuing
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
effecting
respondent’s
release
from
the
custody
of
the
ohio
authorities
pursuant
to
his
having
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
the
basis
for
the
finding
that
even
though
the
arresting
officers
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
evidence
seized
was
and
had
in
fact
have
been
used
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
itself,
that
they
had
had
an
ample
opportunity
to
procure
a
warrant
for
the
seizure
of
this
automobile
and,
therefore,
that
the
seizure
of
the
automobile
was
per
se
unreasonable.
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
describe
the
conditions
leading
up
to
the
seizure
of
the
automobile.
on
july
19,
1967,
a
man
with
the
name
of
paul
radcliffe
who
was
a
certified
public
accountant
was
brutally
murdered.
now,
prior
to
his
murder,
he
had
been
requested
over
a
telephone
to
come
to
the
city
of
delaware,
ohio
to
seek
or
to
give
an
interview
pursuant
to
his
having
been
or
to
his
future
employment
as
a
cpa
for
this
company.
at
that
same
time,
this
anonymous
caller
who
described
himself
as
being
officer
of
the
ibex
(ph)
company
asked
mr.
radcliffe
if
he
would
stop
on
the
way
in
at
a
factory
building
which
had
been
abandoned
to
look
over
the
factory
building
to
determine
whether
the
company
might
use
it
in
future
expansion.
as
he
got
out
of
his
automobile
at
approximately
quarter
to
nine
on
the
morning
of
july
16
--
july
19,
he
was
greeted
by
three
blasts
from
a
shotgun
which
immediately
took
his
life.
his
body
then
was
dragged
over
an
embankment,
his
car
was
shoved
over
an
embankment
and
later
on
because
of
the
fortunate,
and
inadvertent
really,
inspection
of
the
river
by
a
game
warden,
the
car
was
found.
the
police
were
informed
and
after
the
police
had
been
informed,
they
went
out
and
found
the
body.
now,
immediately
of
course
an
investigation
took
place
and
a
neighbor
across
the
street
had
heard
three
shots,
but
had
thought
nothing
about
it
because
in
this
area,
on
numerous
occasions
the
kids
were
hunting,
shooting
off
guns,
and
it
was
rather
common.
but
shortly
afterwards,
she
heard
the
screech
of
tires
and
gravel
being
thrown
up
in
the
fenders
or
underneath
the
fenders
of
the
car,
she
went
to
the
front
door
and,
as
she
did,
she
observed
a
gold
automobile
which
she
describes
as
a
1967
or
1968
oldsmobile
accelerating
towards
columbus.
now,
in
the
investigation
that
followed,
the
delaware
county
authority
discovered
that
arthur
ben
lewis,
the
respondent
herein,
owned
such
an
automobile.
they
also
learned
that,
in
the
process
of
their
investigation,
that
he
had
looked
at
this
building
himself
and
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
it
because
he
thought
he
might
procure
this
building
for
the
purpose
setting
up
a
club.
they
also
knew
that
he
went
by
this
building
everyday
of
his
summer
occupancy
practically
because
he
had
two
swimming
pools
in
the
near
vicinity.
they
then
found
out
that
he
had
also
been
attempting
to
sell
his
--
one
of
his
business,
of
which
he
had
many,
to
some
people
who
had
employed
radcliffe
as
an
auditor
to
inspect
the
books
of
the
company
to
determine
whether
in
fact
the
company
was
sound.
a
telephone
call
made
to
these
people
a
half
hour
after
the
murder
took
place,
after
the
shots
have
been
fired
which
we
assume
was
the
time
that
the
murder
took
place,
the
lady
whose
husband
was
buying
the
business
received
a
call
again
from
an
individual
saying
that
he
was
paul
radcliffe,
that
he
had
examined
the
books
of
the
company,
that
he
was
going
out
of
town
for
a
few
days,
and
that
the
company
was
very
sound
and
recommended
that
the
purchase
go
through.
now,
based
upon
all
of
this
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
officers,
a
search
warrant
--
an
arrest
warrant
was
procured
for
his
arrest
on
october
20,
1967.
it
goes
without
saying
that
at
the
time,
although
had
this
--
they
known
that
they
were
going
to
arrest
him
on
this
particular
day
that
it
might
have
been
said
that
they
could’ve
gotten
a
search
warrant,
but
for
the
automobile,
which
they
knew
by
that
time
it
had
been
used
or
they
had
every
reason
to
believe
it’d
been
used
in
pushing
his
car
over
the
embankment
and
which
had
been
damaged
on
the
front
end
because
there
were
paint
--
yellow
or
gold
paint
flakes
on
the
back
of
the
car
that
had
been
pushed
over
the
embankment.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
the
arrest
warrant
was
issued
by
the
justice
in
delaware
county,
ohio
wherein
the
crime
was
committed.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right.
the
arrest
warrant
was
servable
anywhere
in
the
state
of
ohio,
but
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leo
j.
conway
the
same
judge
had
authority
to
issue
a
search
warrant,
your
honor,
but
only
for
those
things
that
they
wanted
to
search
in
the
county
of
delaware.
in
other
words,
in
ohio,
a
search
warrant
only
may
be
served
in
the
county
wherein
it
was
issued.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
by
a
municipal
judge.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor,
but
it
wouldn’t
have
made
any
difference
because
had
a
common
police
judge
of
delaware
county
issued
a
search
warrant,
it
would’ve
been
invalid
in
franklin
county
where
the
car
or
automobile
was
seized.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
that
was
found
on
the
day
of
the
crime,
your
honor.
the
gold
--
the
automobile
that
was
initially
pushed
over,
that
was
paul
radcliffe’s
automobile
which
had
attempted
to
be
concealed,
had
a
gold
paint
scrapings
on
the
back
bottom
it,
that
was
found
on
the
day
of
the
murder
itself.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
they
would
have
had
to
apply
to
a
justice
in
the
county
wherein
they
knew
the
automobile
was.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
ultimately,
the
car
was
seized
in
jackson
county
--
in
franklin
county
and
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
immediately
adjoining
delaware
county.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
yes,
sir.
there
is,
your
honor,
because
they
didn’t
know
where
the
automobile
was.
now,
in
the
state
of
ohio,
and
i
think
this
is
generally
true.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it’s
required
by
the
constitution
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
at
5
o’clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
--
or
5
or
5:30,
the
record
is
not
exactly
clear,
but
it
was
on
the
late
afternoon
of
the
20th
day
of
october.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
following
the
arrest.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
at
the
time
that
he
was
arrested,
mr.
lewis
took
a
ticket
out
of
his
pocket.
now,
there’s
some
argument
as
to
exactly
what
happened
but
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
a
parking
ticket
presumably
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor
and
the
parking
lot
was
two
doors
from
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
wherein
the
arrest
was
made.
and
he
said
“here
is
my
parking
ticket.”
now,
there’s
really
no
substantial
difference
as
to
the
discovery
of
the
parking
ticket
because
at
the
time
he
pulled
this
out,
he
says
that
he
gave
it
to
his
lawyer
and
says
“you
take
my
car
and
take
it
to
my
family.”
the
officer
say
that
he
said
“here
--
here
is
the
ticket
and
you
take
my
car
and
take
care
of
it.”
this
is
one
of
the
debatable
things
and,
but
the
significant
part
is
that
they
did
not
know
where
the
automobile
was
until
they
saw
the
parking
ticket
and
until
he
himself
indicated
its
location.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
think
there
was
a
very
good
reason,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
knew
that
mr.
lewis
had
the
front
end
of
his
car
fixed
attempting
to
conceal
the
fact
that
it
was
involved
in
a
crime.
they
also
knew
and
he
said
“i
want
this
car
taken
to
my
family.”
now,
if
they
had
not
seized
it
right
then
and
it
had
been
turned
over
to
his
family,
they
probably
never
would’ve
seen
the
automobile
again
which
they
definitely
wanted
very
badly
as
evidence
in
the
murder
trial.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
i
would
say
within
half
a
mile,
your
honor.
the
municipal
court
is
well
within
half
a
mile
of
the
attorney
general’s
office
where
this
happened.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i’m
sure
there
would’ve
been
a
judge
available.
but
had
they
gone
and
gotten
the
automobile
--
the
search
warrant
and
had
not
done
what
they
did
and
that
car
had
been
driven
away,
it
would’ve
done
them
no
good
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
certainly
they
can,
your
honor.
they
could’ve
put
a
policeman
over
or
around
the
top
of
that
automobile,
and
of
course,
it’s
our
contention
then
that
had
they
did
--
had
they
so
done,
then
they
would’ve
deprived
this
man
of
the
possession
of
his
car
and
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
think
he
could’ve.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it
is
my
contention,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
had
they
put
a
policeman
on
the
car
at
that
time
to
guard
it
against
seizure
that
they,
in
effect,
would’ve
been
seizing
it
right
then.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
you
mean
at
the
time
the
car
was
seized?
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
it’d
been
turned
over
by
the
attorney
to
the
arresting
officer
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
and
they
then--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
there’s
also
some
difference
in
that.
it’s
contended
that
he
also
turned
the
keys
over.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
to
the
police
at
the
same
time
he
returned
the
parking
lot
ticket
over
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
actually
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
prior
to
the
break,
i
was
asked
a
question,
i
believe,
who
could’ve
driven
the
car
away
when
the
keys
were
in
the
possession
of
the
officers.
of
course,
there
are
more
than
one
set
of
keys
to
many
cars
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
family
of
the
individual,
mr.
lewis,
could’ve
as
easily
gone
in
and
taken
the
keys.
they
would’ve
had
keys.
they
could’ve
driven
the
car
away
as
well
as
by
using
those
keys
as
the
keys
that
the
police
may
have
had.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
not
without
the
parking
ticket,
but
i
was
assuming
of
course
that
the
keys
and
the
parking
ticket
went
together
regardless.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
the
police
had
the
parking
ticket.
and
of
course,
that’s
our
point,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
the
police
having
had
the
parking
ticket
placed
them
in
the
same
position
as
to
take
the
car
as
it
would
had
they
put
an
officer
on
the
car
to
guard
it.
as
an
example,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
based
their
entire
decision
on
the
coolidge
case
that
was
decided
by
this
court
and,
which
they
indicated
was
on
all
force
with
coolidge.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
no
similarity
between
the
facts
in
this
case
and
coolidge
except
that
they
indicated
that
they
knew
that
they
wanted
--
the
officers
in
this
case
wanted
the
car
prior
to
the
time
the
arrest
was
made,
the
same
as
that
in
coolidge.
but
the
difference
was
in
coolidge
and
in
this
case
is,
as
in
coolidge
the
officers
knew
where
the
car
was.
they
knew
its
description
and
all
they
had
to
do,
as
the
court
indicated,
was
to
get
a
valid
search
warrant
to
go
get
the
car.
in
our
case,
the
officers
at
the
time
that
they
made
the
arrest
did
not
know
where
the
car
was
and
the
only
way
that
they
could
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
and
seized
the
car
prior
thereto
would’ve
perhaps
warranted
their
entire
investigation
and
this
court
definitely
has
indicated
that
that
was
not
necessary
in
the
harper
case,
in
harper
v.
united
states.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
at
the
time
that
--
the
first
time
that
the
police
knew
where
the
car
was,
was
right
when
the
arrest
took
place
or
immediately
thereafter.
again,
stressing
the
ohio
law,
the
--
in
ohio,
there’s
no
search
warrant
provided
for
an
automobile.
a
search
warrant
may
only
be
issued
for
a
home
or
place
and
an
automobile,
i
think,
would
fit
under
the
term
“effects”
as
used
in
the
constitution
and
if
they
want
an
effect,
they
want
to
seize
or
search
an
effect
they
must
specificity
indicate
where
that
effect
is
before
they
can
get
a
search
warrant
to
search
for
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
this
is
not
a
part
of
the
record,
but
that’s
the
way
it’s
done
today
even
though
the
police
have
searched,
have
seized
an
automobile
in
columbus,
ohio
and
it's
in
the
police
--
they
get
the
search
warrant
actually
to
search
it.
and
the
place,
of
course,
is
of
--
the
location
is
police
power.
so
they,
in
effect,
are
serving
a
search
warrant
upon
themselves.
the
other
aspect
of
course
of
coolidge
that
the
court
indicated
or
disagreed
with,
insofar
as
our
argument
was
concerned,
that
there
was
no
exigency.
and
of
course,
that
gets
us
back
to
the
point
that
anybody
in
the
family
could’ve
removed
the
automobile
and
hence
deprived
the
state
of
the
use
of
that
automobile
as
evidence.
now,
we
attempted
in
the
court
below
to
indicate
or
to
base
this
search
upon
a
valid
arrest.
there
isn’t
any
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
the
district
judge,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
made
a
footnote
indicating
that
the
arrest
warrant
was
not
good
in
that
it
did
not
follow
the
federal
requirements
for
arrest
warrants.
but
certainly,
in
the
state
of
ohio,
that
arrest
warrant
was
perfectly
valid.
in
the
state
of
ohio,
although
the
arresting
officer
must
do
over
the
--
when
--
making
the
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
as
to
indicate
that
a,
b
killed
c,
d
and
that
he
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
he
did
and
that’s
exactly
what
the
search
warrant
provided.
it
is
not
required,
under
ohio
law,
that
he
indicate
how
and
where
and
who
said
and
what
have
you
like,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it’s
required
him
a
search
warrant.
now,
when
the
search
--
at
the
time
that
mr.
lewis,
having
been
arrested,
pulled
the
parking
ticket
out
of
his
pocket
and
said
“this
is
the
parking
ticket
to
my
car,”
the
police
certainly
had
a
right,
in
our
opinion,
to
seize
that
parking
ticket
because
they
knew
it
was
a
parking
ticket
for
the
vehicle
that
they
wanted
as
an
instrumentality
or
as
evidence
in
the
crime.
and,
therefore,
they
having
had
taken
this
parking
ticket
validly,
they
had
to
right,
a
continuing
right
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
automobile.
incidentally,
this
was
--
this
automobile
was
parked
on
a
private
parking
lot.
and
there
was
no
reason
that
once
that
the
police
knew
where
the
automobile
was
that
they
could’ve
gone
next
door
and
taken
some
paint
off
of
the
automobile
in
itself.
it
was
in
a
private
place
--
in
a
public
place.
it
was
in
plain
view.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it
is
--
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
even
the
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
they
would’ve
been
seizing
something
in
plain
view,
it
was
our
position.
now,
the
court
below
disagreed
with
that
theory
because
they
said
that
they
had
to
go
down
a
couple
of
layers
in
order
to
do
the
real
comparison,
which
i
agree
with.
i
mean,
they
did
have
to
go
below
the
seeable
part
of
the
paint
on
the
car
in
order
to
make
the
chemical
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
same
paint
or
the
same
type
of
paint
was
--
one
comparable
to
the
other.
but,
nevertheless,
i
believe
that
assuming
for
the
sake
or
argument
that
they
admire
the
car,
they
might
have
actually
been
liable
in
the
tort
action
for
the
scratching
of
the
automobile.
but
that
did
not,
in
any
way,
prevent
them
from
taking
what
they
believe
to
be
a
valid
evidence
to
use
in
the
murder
itself.
when
the
motion
to
suppress
was
filed
in
this
case
in
the
trial
court,
the
only
precedent
that
the
trial
court
had
at
that
time
was
a
recent
precedent
was,
of
course,
cooper
and
preston.
and
the
preston
case,
certainly,
was
very
dissimilar
to
the
case
in
this
--
in
our
situation
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
court
held
in
preston
that
the
reason
for
which
the
car
was
seized
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
had
been
arrested.
but
certainly
in
this
case,
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
evidence
of
the
crime
itself
and
the
police
wanted
it.
now,
the
district
--
the
trial
judge
relied
strictly
on
cooper
in
making
its
determination
on
a
motion
to
suppress
that
the
car
was
validly
seized.
the
court
said,
in
cooper,
the
supreme
court
observed
that
the
car
in
that
case
was
seized
and
impounded
because
of
and
in
connection
with
the
crime
for
which
cooper
was
arrested.
in
this
case,
the
car
was
seized,
impounded
and
searched
because
of
the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
was
arrested.
and
then,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
it
found
that
--
and
incidentally
the
court
in
that
case
did
hold
that
they
believe
that
the
seizure
of
the
parking
ticket
was,
in
effect,
constructive
seizure
of
the
automobile.
but
the
court
said
further
that
this,
in
its
opinion,
rendered
the
seizure
to
have
been
in
all
respects
reasonable.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
likewise
found
the
search
to
be
reasonable
and,
i
believe
by
the
time
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
this
court
had
decided
chambers
v.
maroney
which
gave
impetus,
i
believe,
to
the
decision
in
cooper.
therefore,
it
was
held
that
if
these
officers
had
a
right
to
take
that
car
initially
as
evidence
in
the
crime
on
the
parking
lot
that
they
had
a
right
therefore
to
take
it
to
the
police
impounding
area
and
do
such
search
as
was
necessary.
now,
at
no
time
did
they
ever
enter
the
inside
of
the
car
for
any
evidence
that
was
subsequently
disposed
of
in
this
case.
i
should
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
no,
i’m
not,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
seek
a
review
of
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio,
eastern
division,
issuing
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
effecting
respondent’s
release
from
the
custody
of
the
ohio
authorities
pursuant
to
his
having
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
the
basis
for
the
finding
that
even
though
the
arresting
officers
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
evidence
seized
was
and
had
in
fact
have
been
used
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
itself,
that
they
had
had
an
ample
opportunity
to
procure
a
warrant
for
the
seizure
of
this
automobile
and,
therefore,
that
the
seizure
of
the
automobile
was
per
se
unreasonable.
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
describe
the
conditions
leading
up
to
the
seizure
of
the
automobile.
on
july
19,
1967,
a
man
with
the
name
of
paul
radcliffe
who
was
a
certified
public
accountant
was
brutally
murdered.
now,
prior
to
his
murder,
he
had
been
requested
over
a
telephone
to
come
to
the
city
of
delaware,
ohio
to
seek
or
to
give
an
interview
pursuant
to
his
having
been
or
to
his
future
employment
as
a
cpa
for
this
company.
at
that
same
time,
this
anonymous
caller
who
described
himself
as
being
officer
of
the
ibex
(ph)
company
asked
mr.
radcliffe
if
he
would
stop
on
the
way
in
at
a
factory
building
which
had
been
abandoned
to
look
over
the
factory
building
to
determine
whether
the
company
might
use
it
in
future
expansion.
as
he
got
out
of
his
automobile
at
approximately
quarter
to
nine
on
the
morning
of
july
16
--
july
19,
he
was
greeted
by
three
blasts
from
a
shotgun
which
immediately
took
his
life.
his
body
then
was
dragged
over
an
embankment,
his
car
was
shoved
over
an
embankment
and
later
on
because
of
the
fortunate,
and
inadvertent
really,
inspection
of
the
river
by
a
game
warden,
the
car
was
found.
the
police
were
informed
and
after
the
police
had
been
informed,
they
went
out
and
found
the
body.
now,
immediately
of
course
an
investigation
took
place
and
a
neighbor
across
the
street
had
heard
three
shots,
but
had
thought
nothing
about
it
because
in
this
area,
on
numerous
occasions
the
kids
were
hunting,
shooting
off
guns,
and
it
was
rather
common.
but
shortly
afterwards,
she
heard
the
screech
of
tires
and
gravel
being
thrown
up
in
the
fenders
or
underneath
the
fenders
of
the
car,
she
went
to
the
front
door
and,
as
she
did,
she
observed
a
gold
automobile
which
she
describes
as
a
1967
or
1968
oldsmobile
accelerating
towards
columbus.
now,
in
the
investigation
that
followed,
the
delaware
county
authority
discovered
that
arthur
ben
lewis,
the
respondent
herein,
owned
such
an
automobile.
they
also
learned
that,
in
the
process
of
their
investigation,
that
he
had
looked
at
this
building
himself
and
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
it
because
he
thought
he
might
procure
this
building
for
the
purpose
setting
up
a
club.
they
also
knew
that
he
went
by
this
building
everyday
of
his
summer
occupancy
practically
because
he
had
two
swimming
pools
in
the
near
vicinity.
they
then
found
out
that
he
had
also
been
attempting
to
sell
his
--
one
of
his
business,
of
which
he
had
many,
to
some
people
who
had
employed
radcliffe
as
an
auditor
to
inspect
the
books
of
the
company
to
determine
whether
in
fact
the
company
was
sound.
a
telephone
call
made
to
these
people
a
half
hour
after
the
murder
took
place,
after
the
shots
have
been
fired
which
we
assume
was
the
time
that
the
murder
took
place,
the
lady
whose
husband
was
buying
the
business
received
a
call
again
from
an
individual
saying
that
he
was
paul
radcliffe,
that
he
had
examined
the
books
of
the
company,
that
he
was
going
out
of
town
for
a
few
days,
and
that
the
company
was
very
sound
and
recommended
that
the
purchase
go
through.
now,
based
upon
all
of
this
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
officers,
a
search
warrant
--
an
arrest
warrant
was
procured
for
his
arrest
on
october
20,
1967.
it
goes
without
saying
that
at
the
time,
although
had
this
--
they
known
that
they
were
going
to
arrest
him
on
this
particular
day
that
it
might
have
been
said
that
they
could’ve
gotten
a
search
warrant,
but
for
the
automobile,
which
they
knew
by
that
time
it
had
been
used
or
they
had
every
reason
to
believe
it’d
been
used
in
pushing
his
car
over
the
embankment
and
which
had
been
damaged
on
the
front
end
because
there
were
paint
--
yellow
or
gold
paint
flakes
on
the
back
of
the
car
that
had
been
pushed
over
the
embankment.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
the
arrest
warrant
was
issued
by
the
justice
in
delaware
county,
ohio
wherein
the
crime
was
committed.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right.
the
arrest
warrant
was
servable
anywhere
in
the
state
of
ohio,
but
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leo
j.
conway
the
same
judge
had
authority
to
issue
a
search
warrant,
your
honor,
but
only
for
those
things
that
they
wanted
to
search
in
the
county
of
delaware.
in
other
words,
in
ohio,
a
search
warrant
only
may
be
served
in
the
county
wherein
it
was
issued.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
by
a
municipal
judge.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor,
but
it
wouldn’t
have
made
any
difference
because
had
a
common
police
judge
of
delaware
county
issued
a
search
warrant,
it
would’ve
been
invalid
in
franklin
county
where
the
car
or
automobile
was
seized.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
that
was
found
on
the
day
of
the
crime,
your
honor.
the
gold
--
the
automobile
that
was
initially
pushed
over,
that
was
paul
radcliffe’s
automobile
which
had
attempted
to
be
concealed,
had
a
gold
paint
scrapings
on
the
back
bottom
it,
that
was
found
on
the
day
of
the
murder
itself.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
they
would
have
had
to
apply
to
a
justice
in
the
county
wherein
they
knew
the
automobile
was.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
ultimately,
the
car
was
seized
in
jackson
county
--
in
franklin
county
and
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
immediately
adjoining
delaware
county.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
yes,
sir.
there
is,
your
honor,
because
they
didn’t
know
where
the
automobile
was.
now,
in
the
state
of
ohio,
and
i
think
this
is
generally
true.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it’s
required
by
the
constitution
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
at
5
o’clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
--
or
5
or
5:30,
the
record
is
not
exactly
clear,
but
it
was
on
the
late
afternoon
of
the
20th
day
of
october.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
following
the
arrest.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
at
the
time
that
he
was
arrested,
mr.
lewis
took
a
ticket
out
of
his
pocket.
now,
there’s
some
argument
as
to
exactly
what
happened
but
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
a
parking
ticket
presumably
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor
and
the
parking
lot
was
two
doors
from
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
wherein
the
arrest
was
made.
and
he
said
“here
is
my
parking
ticket.”
now,
there’s
really
no
substantial
difference
as
to
the
discovery
of
the
parking
ticket
because
at
the
time
he
pulled
this
out,
he
says
that
he
gave
it
to
his
lawyer
and
says
“you
take
my
car
and
take
it
to
my
family.”
the
officer
say
that
he
said
“here
--
here
is
the
ticket
and
you
take
my
car
and
take
care
of
it.”
this
is
one
of
the
debatable
things
and,
but
the
significant
part
is
that
they
did
not
know
where
the
automobile
was
until
they
saw
the
parking
ticket
and
until
he
himself
indicated
its
location.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
think
there
was
a
very
good
reason,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
knew
that
mr.
lewis
had
the
front
end
of
his
car
fixed
attempting
to
conceal
the
fact
that
it
was
involved
in
a
crime.
they
also
knew
and
he
said
“i
want
this
car
taken
to
my
family.”
now,
if
they
had
not
seized
it
right
then
and
it
had
been
turned
over
to
his
family,
they
probably
never
would’ve
seen
the
automobile
again
which
they
definitely
wanted
very
badly
as
evidence
in
the
murder
trial.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
i
would
say
within
half
a
mile,
your
honor.
the
municipal
court
is
well
within
half
a
mile
of
the
attorney
general’s
office
where
this
happened.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i’m
sure
there
would’ve
been
a
judge
available.
but
had
they
gone
and
gotten
the
automobile
--
the
search
warrant
and
had
not
done
what
they
did
and
that
car
had
been
driven
away,
it
would’ve
done
them
no
good
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
certainly
they
can,
your
honor.
they
could’ve
put
a
policeman
over
or
around
the
top
of
that
automobile,
and
of
course,
it’s
our
contention
then
that
had
they
did
--
had
they
so
done,
then
they
would’ve
deprived
this
man
of
the
possession
of
his
car
and
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
i
think
he
could’ve.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it
is
my
contention,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
had
they
put
a
policeman
on
the
car
at
that
time
to
guard
it
against
seizure
that
they,
in
effect,
would’ve
been
seizing
it
right
then.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
you
mean
at
the
time
the
car
was
seized?
mr.
leo
j.
conway
well,
it’d
been
turned
over
by
the
attorney
to
the
arresting
officer
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
and
they
then--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
there’s
also
some
difference
in
that.
it’s
contended
that
he
also
turned
the
keys
over.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
to
the
police
at
the
same
time
he
returned
the
parking
lot
ticket
over
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
actually
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
prior
to
the
break,
i
was
asked
a
question,
i
believe,
who
could’ve
driven
the
car
away
when
the
keys
were
in
the
possession
of
the
officers.
of
course,
there
are
more
than
one
set
of
keys
to
many
cars
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
family
of
the
individual,
mr.
lewis,
could’ve
as
easily
gone
in
and
taken
the
keys.
they
would’ve
had
keys.
they
could’ve
driven
the
car
away
as
well
as
by
using
those
keys
as
the
keys
that
the
police
may
have
had.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
not
without
the
parking
ticket,
but
i
was
assuming
of
course
that
the
keys
and
the
parking
ticket
went
together
regardless.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
the
police
had
the
parking
ticket.
and
of
course,
that’s
our
point,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
the
police
having
had
the
parking
ticket
placed
them
in
the
same
position
as
to
take
the
car
as
it
would
had
they
put
an
officer
on
the
car
to
guard
it.
as
an
example,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
based
their
entire
decision
on
the
coolidge
case
that
was
decided
by
this
court
and,
which
they
indicated
was
on
all
force
with
coolidge.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
no
similarity
between
the
facts
in
this
case
and
coolidge
except
that
they
indicated
that
they
knew
that
they
wanted
--
the
officers
in
this
case
wanted
the
car
prior
to
the
time
the
arrest
was
made,
the
same
as
that
in
coolidge.
but
the
difference
was
in
coolidge
and
in
this
case
is,
as
in
coolidge
the
officers
knew
where
the
car
was.
they
knew
its
description
and
all
they
had
to
do,
as
the
court
indicated,
was
to
get
a
valid
search
warrant
to
go
get
the
car.
in
our
case,
the
officers
at
the
time
that
they
made
the
arrest
did
not
know
where
the
car
was
and
the
only
way
that
they
could
have
gotten
a
search
warrant
and
seized
the
car
prior
thereto
would’ve
perhaps
warranted
their
entire
investigation
and
this
court
definitely
has
indicated
that
that
was
not
necessary
in
the
harper
case,
in
harper
v.
united
states.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
at
the
time
that
--
the
first
time
that
the
police
knew
where
the
car
was,
was
right
when
the
arrest
took
place
or
immediately
thereafter.
again,
stressing
the
ohio
law,
the
--
in
ohio,
there’s
no
search
warrant
provided
for
an
automobile.
a
search
warrant
may
only
be
issued
for
a
home
or
place
and
an
automobile,
i
think,
would
fit
under
the
term
“effects”
as
used
in
the
constitution
and
if
they
want
an
effect,
they
want
to
seize
or
search
an
effect
they
must
specificity
indicate
where
that
effect
is
before
they
can
get
a
search
warrant
to
search
for
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
this
is
not
a
part
of
the
record,
but
that’s
the
way
it’s
done
today
even
though
the
police
have
searched,
have
seized
an
automobile
in
columbus,
ohio
and
it's
in
the
police
--
they
get
the
search
warrant
actually
to
search
it.
and
the
place,
of
course,
is
of
--
the
location
is
police
power.
so
they,
in
effect,
are
serving
a
search
warrant
upon
themselves.
the
other
aspect
of
course
of
coolidge
that
the
court
indicated
or
disagreed
with,
insofar
as
our
argument
was
concerned,
that
there
was
no
exigency.
and
of
course,
that
gets
us
back
to
the
point
that
anybody
in
the
family
could’ve
removed
the
automobile
and
hence
deprived
the
state
of
the
use
of
that
automobile
as
evidence.
now,
we
attempted
in
the
court
below
to
indicate
or
to
base
this
search
upon
a
valid
arrest.
there
isn’t
any
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
the
district
judge,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
made
a
footnote
indicating
that
the
arrest
warrant
was
not
good
in
that
it
did
not
follow
the
federal
requirements
for
arrest
warrants.
but
certainly,
in
the
state
of
ohio,
that
arrest
warrant
was
perfectly
valid.
in
the
state
of
ohio,
although
the
arresting
officer
must
do
over
the
--
when
--
making
the
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
as
to
indicate
that
a,
b
killed
c,
d
and
that
he
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
he
did
and
that’s
exactly
what
the
search
warrant
provided.
it
is
not
required,
under
ohio
law,
that
he
indicate
how
and
where
and
who
said
and
what
have
you
like,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it’s
required
him
a
search
warrant.
now,
when
the
search
--
at
the
time
that
mr.
lewis,
having
been
arrested,
pulled
the
parking
ticket
out
of
his
pocket
and
said
“this
is
the
parking
ticket
to
my
car,”
the
police
certainly
had
a
right,
in
our
opinion,
to
seize
that
parking
ticket
because
they
knew
it
was
a
parking
ticket
for
the
vehicle
that
they
wanted
as
an
instrumentality
or
as
evidence
in
the
crime.
and,
therefore,
they
having
had
taken
this
parking
ticket
validly,
they
had
to
right,
a
continuing
right
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
automobile.
incidentally,
this
was
--
this
automobile
was
parked
on
a
private
parking
lot.
and
there
was
no
reason
that
once
that
the
police
knew
where
the
automobile
was
that
they
could’ve
gone
next
door
and
taken
some
paint
off
of
the
automobile
in
itself.
it
was
in
a
private
place
--
in
a
public
place.
it
was
in
plain
view.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
it
is
--
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
even
the
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
they
would’ve
been
seizing
something
in
plain
view,
it
was
our
position.
now,
the
court
below
disagreed
with
that
theory
because
they
said
that
they
had
to
go
down
a
couple
of
layers
in
order
to
do
the
real
comparison,
which
i
agree
with.
i
mean,
they
did
have
to
go
below
the
seeable
part
of
the
paint
on
the
car
in
order
to
make
the
chemical
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
same
paint
or
the
same
type
of
paint
was
--
one
comparable
to
the
other.
but,
nevertheless,
i
believe
that
assuming
for
the
sake
or
argument
that
they
admire
the
car,
they
might
have
actually
been
liable
in
the
tort
action
for
the
scratching
of
the
automobile.
but
that
did
not,
in
any
way,
prevent
them
from
taking
what
they
believe
to
be
a
valid
evidence
to
use
in
the
murder
itself.
when
the
motion
to
suppress
was
filed
in
this
case
in
the
trial
court,
the
only
precedent
that
the
trial
court
had
at
that
time
was
a
recent
precedent
was,
of
course,
cooper
and
preston.
and
the
preston
case,
certainly,
was
very
dissimilar
to
the
case
in
this
--
in
our
situation
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
court
held
in
preston
that
the
reason
for
which
the
car
was
seized
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
had
been
arrested.
but
certainly
in
this
case,
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
evidence
of
the
crime
itself
and
the
police
wanted
it.
now,
the
district
--
the
trial
judge
relied
strictly
on
cooper
in
making
its
determination
on
a
motion
to
suppress
that
the
car
was
validly
seized.
the
court
said,
in
cooper,
the
supreme
court
observed
that
the
car
in
that
case
was
seized
and
impounded
because
of
and
in
connection
with
the
crime
for
which
cooper
was
arrested.
in
this
case,
the
car
was
seized,
impounded
and
searched
because
of
the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
was
arrested.
and
then,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
it
found
that
--
and
incidentally
the
court
in
that
case
did
hold
that
they
believe
that
the
seizure
of
the
parking
ticket
was,
in
effect,
constructive
seizure
of
the
automobile.
but
the
court
said
further
that
this,
in
its
opinion,
rendered
the
seizure
to
have
been
in
all
respects
reasonable.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
likewise
found
the
search
to
be
reasonable
and,
i
believe
by
the
time
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
this
court
had
decided
chambers
v.
maroney
which
gave
impetus,
i
believe,
to
the
decision
in
cooper.
therefore,
it
was
held
that
if
these
officers
had
a
right
to
take
that
car
initially
as
evidence
in
the
crime
on
the
parking
lot
that
they
had
a
right
therefore
to
take
it
to
the
police
impounding
area
and
do
such
search
as
was
necessary.
now,
at
no
time
did
they
ever
enter
the
inside
of
the
car
for
any
evidence
that
was
subsequently
disposed
of
in
this
case.
i
should
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
--
mr.
leo
j.
conway
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
j.
conway
no,
i’m
not,
your
honor.
