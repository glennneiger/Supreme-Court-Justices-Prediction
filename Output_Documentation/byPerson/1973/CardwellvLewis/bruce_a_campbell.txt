mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
read
the
briefs
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
of
the
solicitor
general
and
as
i
listen
to
the
oral
arguments
of
my
brothers
mr.
frey
and
mr.
conway,
i
am
struck
repeatedly
by
the
aptness
of
the
observation
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent
in
rabinowitz.
and
i
paraphrase
to
some
extent
here
that,
“where
one
comes
out
on
a
case
depends
very
much
on
where
one
goes
in.
and
that
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
whether
one
approaches
the
fourth
amendment
as
a
safeguard
against
recurrent
abuses
or
merely
as
a
provision
dealing
with
a
formality.”
it
seemed
to
me
that
both
the
petitioner
and
the
amicus
in
this
case
seem
to
take
as
granted
that
it
is
somehow
automatically
desirable
that,
as
many
areas
as
possible
to
be
excised
from
fourth
amendment
protection
and
that
police
action
wherever
possible
be
taken
out
from
under
the
coverage
of
that
amendment.
and
they
do
that
in
this
case
without
devoting
in
their
briefs
or
in
their
oral
argument
a
single
word
as
to
why
there
was,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
a
specific
burden
upon
law
enforcement
a
specific
risk
to
be
taken
by
the
procuring
of
a
warrant
in
this
case.
and
they
also
do
this
it
seems
to
me,
without
stopping
to
consider
the
potentiality
for
executive
abuse
that
is
inherent
in
the
positions
which
they
urge.
respondent,
of
course,
approaches
this
case
from
the
perspective
of
the
very
fundamental
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
would
like
before
i
begin
to
clear
up,
i
think,
some
factual
difficulties
that
have
arisen
from
oral
argument.
mr.
conway,
i
think,
has
supplied
some
details
of
the
murder
itself
which
are
at
least
speculative
in
the
record
and
i
think
that
there
are
some
other
inaccuracies
that
should
be
corrected.
first
of
all,
it
is
claimed
that
the
witness
at
the
--
near
the
murder
scene
who
saw
the
departing
automobile
claimed
it
to
have
been
a
gold
‘67
or
‘68
oldsmobile.
in
fact,
she
said
that
it
was
tan
or
beige
car
that
it
was
of
a
make
similar
to
her
own
corvette
but
she
was
not
aware
of
what
specific
brand
of
car
it
was.
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
phone
call
that
was
received
by
the
wife
of
the
person
who
was
purchasing
the
business,
mr.
smith,
who
had
hired
the
decedent,
mr.
radcliffe,
to
examine
the
books.
the
record
of
the
case
will
disclose
that
the
caller,
whoever
that
caller
may
have
been,
did
not
specifically
say
“i
have
examined
the
books
of
grahams
auto
parts,”
which
was
the
name
of
the
business
that
the
defendant
was
attempting
to
sell
to
mr.
smith.
it
merely
said
--
that
witness
at
the
trial
merely
claimed
that
the
caller
said
“i
have
examined
the
books
and
they
are
in
a
one
shape.”
now,
it
is
also
fact
in
the
record
that
the
accountant
was
the
general
accountant
for
mr.
smith,
not
just
the
accountant
for
the
specific
purpose
of
this
particular
transaction.
so,
i
think
that
the
state
has
inferred
more
than
it
should
from
that
telephone
call.
and
one
final
matter;
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
person
searching
the
car
on
the
day
it
was
seized
did
not
intrude
upon
the
interior
of
that
car.
in
fact,
he
did,
he
opened
the
trunk
of
that
car
and
looked
in
and
observed
a
nearly
new
tire
and
he
testified
about
this
at
trial.
now,
the
reason
that
that
has
not
been
emphasized
in
this
appeal
or
throughout
the
course
of
this
case
is
that
there
was
other
testimony
concerning
the
tires,
whereas,
the
only
testimony
concerning
the
paint
came
as
the
result
of
the
taking
of
the
paint
from
the
automobile
at
the
time
of
the
search.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have,
here,
essentially
two
distinct
characterizations
of
the
case.
the
state
of
ohio
says
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
almost
all
of
the
traditional
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
were
present.
they
claim
consent.
they
claim
that
there
was
incidency
to
the
arrest.
they
claim
that
there
was
urgency
of
circumstance
that
necessitated
a
warrantless
seizure.
the
solicitor
general
takes
quite
a
different
view.
he
says
he
explicitly
denies
that
there
were
exigent
circumstances
here
and
he
tacitly
seems
to
concede
that
there
was
no
consent
and
no
incidency
to
the
arrest.
but
he
argues
that
one
has
less
than
a
full-fledged
fourth
amendment
interest
in
his
automobile
and
that
the
scraping
of
the
paint
in
this
case
was
not
a
seizure
as
such.
with
respect
to
probable
cause,
there
seems
also
to
be
a
disagreement.
the
solicitor
general
has
urged
unquestionably
that
there
was
probable
cause,
although
he
does
not
explain
this
at
any
point.
the
state
of
ohio
seems
to
be
in
doubt.
in
its
own
conclusion,
at
page
35
of
its
brief
it
states
that
while
the
authorities
in
our
case
had
information
relating
to
the
car
prior
to
the
seizure,
there
is
no
indication
that
such
information
amounted
to
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
warrant.
i
propose
to
examine
in
turn,
first,
the
more
traditional
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
that
are
raised
primarily
by
the
state,
specifically
consent
search
incident
and
exigent
circumstances.
and
then,
move
to
what
i
perceive
to
be
the
more
novel
exception
which
the
state
indirectly
and
the
solicitor
general
more
specifically
has
asked
this
court
to
countenance.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
consent
in
this
case,
i
would
first
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
issue
is,
at
best,
clouded
upon
the
record.
there
are
essentially
two
versions
of
what
happened
on
october
10,
1967
which
was
the
day
when
the
defendant
was
asked
to
come
to
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
he
appeared,
he
was
questioned
throughout
the
day
despite
the
fact
that
the
officers
already
at
that
time
had
an
arrest
warrant
for
first-degree
murder
for
him.
a
tape
recording
was
made
of
that
interrogation
session,
and
i’ll
refer
to
that
later.
the
respondent
says
that,
at
that
time,
the
--
that
he
attempted
only
to
turnover
the
keys
and
the
claim
check
of
his
automobile
to
his
attorney,
mr.
scott
and
this
is
verified
by
his
two
attorneys,
mr.
tingly
who’s
the
first
attorney
and
mr.
scott
as
well.
mr.
tingly
testified
in
a
motion
to
suppress
hearing
prior
to
the
trial,
and
mr.
scott
testified
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court.
now,
the
investigating
officials
here
claim
that
what
happened
was
that
the
defendant
made
a
request
that
his
car
be
kept
for
“safekeeping,”
but
mr.
--
sergeant
lavery
himself
conceded
that
this
request
made
to
no
one
in
particular.
that
may
be
found
on
page
58a
of
the
appendix
and
he
seems
that
--
sergeant
lavery
seems
also
to
be
at
least
confused
as
to
when
exactly
this
occurred.
at
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress,
he
thought
that
it
was
probably
before
the
defendant’s
counsel
had
arrived
at
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
subsequently,
at
the
evidentiary
hearing,
he
seemed
to
be
sure
that
it
was
after
counsel
had
arrived.
now,
the
district
court
examined
at
some
length,
i
think,
all
of
the
facts
surrounding
this
alleged
consent
and
determined
that
even
if
it
took
these
facts
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
state,
which
it
was
not
required
to
do
even
under
that
construction,
there
was
not
sufficient
consent
to
allow
the
taking
of
the
automobile
here.
the
state
courts
did
not
find
consent
either.
the
trial
court
rested
its
decision
on
a
search
incident
theory.
the
ohio
supreme
court
went
off
on
what
could
only
be
described
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
theory,
interestingly
enough,
never
even
citing
warden
versus
hayden
which
had
been
decided
some
two
years
prior
to
that.
the
burden
of
proving
consent
here
was
clearly
on
the
state,
as
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
and
most
recently
in
the
schneckloth
decision
and
in
the
matlock
decision.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
imply
a
full
waiver
of
fourth
amendment
constitutional
rights
from
what,
at
most,
coul
be
characterized
as
an
expression
of
concern
about
one’s
property
would
be
the
ultimate
paradox.
if
it
is
a
desirable
goal
to
foster
citizen
cooperation
with
investigation
--
with
law
investigation,
and
mr.
lewis
in
this
case
was
most
cooperative,
it
hardly
seems
to
be
in
furtherance
of
that
goal
to
allow
sweeping
interpretations
to
be
made
of
a
simple
request
of
the
nature
of
the
warrant
here.
now,
perhaps,
one
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
in
the
brief
for
the
state
of
ohio,
consent
is
raised
at
least
in
the
way
that
the
state
presents
its
case.
and
consent
is
raised
in
another
way
by
the
solicitor
general.
he
proposes
that
though
there
may
not
have
been
enough
consent
here
for
a
seizure
of
the
automobile,
there
was
somehow
enough
consent
that
the
automobile
could
be
taken
into
custody
and
then
searched.
i
submit
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
solicitor
general’s
brief
that
it
is
something
of
an
argument
in
passing,
but
he
does
raise
the
possibility
that
there
may
have
been
sufficient
consent
here
to
merit
a
taking
into
custody
and
then
he
argues
from
that
that
what
followed
was
not
really
a
search
at
all
and
that
it
was
justified
very
much
in
the
line
that
this
court
justified
cooper.
i
submit
that
this
is
pure
sophistry,
that
consent
to
search
is
certainly
no
different
than
consent
to
take
into
custody.
now,
with
respect
to
the
incidence
to
arrest,
the
petitioner
here
proposes
a
nexus
between
the
arrest
and
car
seizure
based
not
upon
the
physical
proximity
of
the
defendant
and
his
automobile,
but
rather
upon
his
possession
at
the
moment
of
arrest
of
a
parking
lot
claim
check
for
the
car
and
perhaps
the
keys.
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
a
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
whether
mr.
lewis
had
the
keys
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
or
not.
mr.
lewis
says
that
he
did.
other
witnesses
said
only
the
claim
check
was
apparently
turned
over
and
it
may
have
been
a
parking
lot
where
the
keys
were
kept
at
the
parking
lot.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
none,
your
honor,
from
my
point
of
view.
in
effect,
i
think
the
petitioner
is
urging
a
doctrine
of
constructive
possession
whereby
what
one
has
on
his
possession,
if
it
is
a
part
of
or
a
means
of
access
to,
some
other
object,
will
allow
the
state
then
to
seize
that
other
object
no
matter
where
it
may
be.
i
believe
this
to
be
an
absurd
extension
of
the
search
incidency
doctrine
and
that
it
is
founded
upon
no
prior
case
law.
it
seemed
to
me,
as
the
district
court
held,
that
incidency
in
this
case
must
be
judged
upon
(inaudible)
standards
that
rabinowitz
is
probably
the
controlling
case,
but
even
in
rabinowitz
the
court
held
that
--
held
only
that
a
tiny
office
in
which
the
defendant
was
arrested
and
which
was
under
his
immediate
and
complete
control
could
be
searched.
the
preston
case
which,
again,
was
decided
before
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
case
occurred,
involved
an
automobile
on
the
street
and,
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
once
an
accused
is
under
arrest
and
in
custody,
then
a
search
made
at
another
place
without
a
warrant
is
simply
not
incident
to
the
arrest.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i’m
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
believe
that
that
case
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
this
case.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
the
warrant
would
be
required.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
would
think
so.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
because
the
key
does
not
subsume
the
identity
of
the
object
to
which
it
admits
one.
i
might
have
in
my
possession
the
combination
to
a
safe.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
means
that
that
safe,
if
it
can
be
located,
can
be
opened
merely
because
i
had
a
list
of
numbers
in
my
pocket.
there
is
nothing
about
the
key
in
the
example
that
you
pose
that
takes
over
the
identity
of
the
object
that
is
later
searched
and
seized.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
believe
that
they
would
have
to
have
a
warrant,
your
honor,
under
the
same
rational.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
and
i
do
take
that
position.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
would
think
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
the
seizure
of
the
car
key
was
tantamount
to
the
seizure
of
the
car
itself,
then
the
logical
extension
of
that
would
be
that
the
seizure
of
the
house
key
was
indeed
the
seizure
of
the
house.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
at
the
parking
lot,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
your
honor,
i
would
make
no
distinction
in
this
case
between
the
parking
on
a
commercial
parking
lot
and
the
parking
in
any
area
that
is
legally
designated
for
the
parking
of
an
automobile.
i
don’t
think
that
this
case
turns
upon
the
private
nature
of
the
parking
lot.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
your
honor,
as
long
as
that
car
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
the
thing
that’s
wrong
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that,
in
my
view
it
is
a
seizure
and,
as
such,
it
should
have
been
justified
by
a
warrant
if
indeed
there
was
time
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
quite
possibly,
yes.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
the
can
of
paint,
i
would
take
it,
would
not
be
an
integral
part
of
the
car
itself
and
not
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
that
seems
to
be
his
position.
i
disagree
with
that
position.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
because
it
is
an
integral
part
of
that
house.
it
is
not
something
in
plain
view.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
there
is
at
the
point
after
the
seizure.
once
the
paint
is
seized,
it
is
then
examined,
and
that
becomes
the
search.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
are
helpful
here.
chambers
versus
maroney
merely
said
that
where
the
antecedent
seizure
at
the
site
of
the
arrest
would
validate
a
search,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
move
the
car
to
a
safe
place.
but
here,
unlike
chambers,
we
did
not
have
a
vehicle
stopped
on
the
open
road.
we
had
not
need
to
divert
man
power
from
the
arrest
function
to
the
search
function.
and
here,
the
search,
in
any
event,
was
not
completed
as
was
the
search
in
chambers
versus
maroney
as
soon
as
it
was
reasonably
practical.
neither
are
the
robinson
and
gustafson
case,
cases
recently
decided
by
this
court,
helpful
here
because,
in
those
cases,
the
court
dealt
with
a
very
direct
physical
relationship
between
the
one
arrested
and
the
object
on
his
person.
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
at
some
considerable
distance
from
his
car
at
the
time
of
arrest.
he
had
been
out
of
his
car
for
at
least
seven
hours
by
the
time
of
the
arrest.
he
had
no
means
of
getting
to
it
and,
during
the
day,
he
was
held
in
closed
confinement.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
your
honor,
first,
let
me
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
was
required
in
this
case.
but
if
it
had
been,
i
do
not
believe
that
would
have
constituted
a
full
seizure
of
the
car.
i
realize
that
there
is
a
problem
here,
and
it
is
a
problem
which
the
court
wrestled
with
in
chambers
versus
maroney.
but
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
court
should
examine,
perhaps,
the
possibility
that
that
lesser
intrusion
may
solve
some
very
difficult
search
problems
in
this
area.
i
am
aware
that
guard-posting
is
a
theory
that
this
court
has
not
generally
countenanced,
although
i
think
recently
in
the
cady
versus
dombrowski
case
there
was
some
suggestion
that
perhaps
what
might
be
reasonable
in
a
metropolitan
jurisdiction
where
the
magistrate
is
readily
available
and
there
are
other
police
officers
on
the
scene
might
not
be
reasonable
in
a
rural
setting.
here,
i
think,
we
had
a
very
good
case
for
guard-posting
if
it
were
necessary.
but
as
i
say,
it
was
not
necessary
in
this
case.
the
car
was
effectively
immobilized.
this,
i
think,
brings
me
to
the
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
that
kind
of
temporary
keeping
for
a
reasonable
time
while
a
warrant
is
sought
from
a
seizure
itself
and
i
believe
that
that
kind
of
distinction
might
be
helpful
in
another
case,
but
i
don’t
believe
that
it
was
the
reality
of
this
case
and
necessary
here.
petitioner
has
also
claimed
exigency
of
circumstance
or
urgency,
here,
necessitating
the
warrantless
seizure
of
this
automobile.
he
rests
his
claim,
i
think,
on
three
assumptions.
first
of
all,
that
the
investigators
did
not
know
where
the
car
was.
second,
that
confederates
may
have
absconded
with
the
car.
and
finally,
that
probable
cause,
if
it
existed
at
all,
did
not
come
into
being
until
the
moment
of
arrest.
i’d
like
to
take
each
one
of
these
claims
in
turn,
if
i
may.
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
car,
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
state
did
not
know
at
many
times
throughout
this
investigation
where
the
car
was.
in
fact,
they
had
very
specific
knowledge
about
the
car
and
had
seen
the
car
78
days
prior
to
october
10.
they
went
to
the
defendant’s
place
of
business.
they
asked
him
where
his
car
was.
it
was
in
the
parking
lot.
he
pointed
it
to
them
--
pointed
it
out
to
them.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
note
its
color
and
did,
in
fact,
at
that
moment,
begin
to
consider
him
as
a
suspect
because
the
color
of
the
car
matched
the
one
that
they
already
were
looking
for.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
any
doubt
that
the
court
might
have
about
the
specificity
of
the
information
which
the
state
had
by
the
time
of
october
10
concerning
the
defendant,
his
car,
his
home,
his
general
whereabouts,
his
businesses,
his
financial
condition
can
easily
be
dispelled
by
reading
in
the
bill
of
exceptions,
the
transcription
of
the
interrogation
session
which
took
place
on
october
10.
you
will
remember
that
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
a
tape
recording
was
made
unknown
to
the
defendant
of
that
interrogation
session.
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
state
attempted
to,
first,
introduce
this
transcript
into
the
record.
this
was
objected
to
and
the
objection
was
sustained,
but
then,
the
trial
judge
allowed
one
of
the
states’
witnesses,
mr.
mann,
to
read
verbatim
into
the
record
the
record
of
that
transcription
of
the
interrogation
session
and
that
may
be
found
on
page
485
to
568
of
the
bill
of
exceptions.
throughout
that
interrogation
session,
it
is
clear
that
they
had
very
specific
knowledge
about
where
mr.
lewis
had
been,
who
he
had
talked
to,
where
his
car
was,
where
his
home
was.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
your
honor,
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
his
home
was
in
franklin
county
or
delaware
county.
he
moved
between
the
two
frequently,
and
i
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
if
it
does,
i’m
sorry.
i
don’t
know
for
sure.
there
is
talk
in
the
record
that
i
just
told
you
about
as
to
where
--
there
is
a
dialogue
between
the
investigator
and
mr.
lewis
about
his
home,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
says
where
he
lived.
as
in
the
side,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
record
of
that
interrogation
is
instructive
in
its
own
right
of
why,
as
the
court
has
said
from
time
to
time,
zealous
officers
engaged
in
the
enterprise
of
ferreting
out
crime
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
ad
hoc
judgments
about
probable
cause
matters.
that
was
a
brutal
interrogation
session,
not
in
a
physical
sense
but
in
a
mental
sense.
during
the
course
of
that
interrogation,
the
state
repeatedly
tried
to
get
the
defendant
to
take
a
lie
detector
test
although,
at
the
very
first
instance,
the
defendant
said
he
would
not
even
consider
it
without
talking
to
counsel.
and
in
another
place
in
the
record
of
that
interrogation,
the
interrogator
attempts
to
help
mr.
lewis
fabricate
a
non-premeditative
version
of
the
facts
of
this
killing
in
order
that
he
might
not
have
to
charge
him
with
first-degree
murder,
not
telling
him
that
a
first-degree
murder
warrant
was
already
in
existence.
now,
with
respect
to
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
confederate
in
this
crime,
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
that
shows
that
there
ever
was
an
accomplice,
that
the
state
ever
believed
that
there
was
an
accomplice,
that
the
defendant’s
family
was
in
any
way
in
league
with
the
defendant
or
would
have
removed
the
car.
and
as
to
mr.
scott,
the
attorney,
it
seems
to
me
that
once
mr.
scott
turned
over
the
claim
check
and
perhaps
the
keys
to
the
police
that,
at
that
point
in
time,
he
indicated
that
he
was
not
going
to
run
a
footrace
with
the
investigators
down
to
the
car
and
he
indicated
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
the
car.
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
car
would
be
taken
out
of
the
jurisdiction.
now,
the
final
assumption,
i
think,
is
--
deals
with
the
question
of
probable
cause.
now,
the
state
claims
here
that
there
may
not
have
been
probable
cause
up
to
october
10
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
the
automobile.
but
then,
it
seems
to
claim
that
somehow
during
the
day
something
developed
that
made
the
probable
cause
argument
and
made
the
seizure
possible.
but
the
only
fact
that
they’ve
suggested
that
has
emerged
during
that
interrogation
on
october
10
was
the
fact
that
the
defendant
gave
a
slightly
different
version
of
why
he
had
had
his
car
repaired
than
he
did
when
he
had
it
repaired.
now,
there
is
no
showing
by
the
petitioner
why
this
tiny
fact,
added
to
the
others
that
the
police
had,
somehow
became
the
sine
qua
non
of
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
he
was
there
from
10
o’clock
in
the
morning
until
arrested
at
5:30
with
the
exception
of
a
brief
period
when
he
left
in
the
company
of
the
officers
and
went
to
his
home
and
with
his
own
consent,
he
searched
his
house
for
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
i
still
don’t
know
precisely
whether
the
house
was
in
delaware
county
or
franklin
county.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
mr.
conway
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
other
than
the
transcript
that
we
have
of
that
interrogation,
no
or
do
i
understand
your
question
correctly?
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
we
have
a
trans--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
we
have
what
the
state
has
claimed
to
be
an
accurate
transcript
of
the
questioning
that
took
place
starting
about
10:30
until
about
3:00
in
the
afternoon
when
--
or
3:30
in
the
afternoon,
when
mr.
lewis
finally
said
that
“i
want
a
lawyer.”
and
at
that
point,
questioning
apparently
was
broken
off
and
that’s
the
end
of
the
transcript.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
the
only
--
yes,
that’s
the
only
thing
that
emerged
during
that.
and
it’s
interesting
to
point
out
that
that
emerged
quite
early
in
the
record
of
that
interrogation,
probably
early
in
the
morning,
so
that
they
had
at
least
the
afternoon
to
obtain
a
warrant.
turning,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
raised
by
the
amicus
in
this
case,
it
would
seem
to
argue
to
this
court
that
somehow
an
individual’s
privacy
interest
in
his
automobile,
at
least
when
it’s
not
parked
at
home,
is
not
of
sufficient
intensity
to
necessitate
full
invocation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
would,
first,
examine
the
assumption
that
he
makes
that
individuals
do
not
expect
in
an
automobile
the
same
kind
of
security
interest
that
they
do
in
other
objects
of
their
life.
certainly,
there
is
no
basis
in
the
fourth
amendment
to
differentiate
between
an
automobile
and
other
effects.
the
solicitor
general
cites
no
empirical
data
suggesting
that
americans
do
not
expect
a
privacy
interest
in
their
automobiles.
and,
the
only
case
law
which
he
cites
is
a
52-year-old
michigan
case
dealing
with
a
car
that
was
found
upon
fairgrounds.
i
submit
that
the
assumption
that,
in
1974,
we
do
not
expect
the
same
privacy
interest
with
respect
to
our
automobiles
that
we
do
with
respect
to
other
accouterments
of
our
life
is
simply
unfounded.
it
might
be
or
it
might
have
been
a
valid
assumption
in
a
more
pastoral
age
when
people
led
a
self-contained
existence
on
their
own
homestead.
but
today,
if
anything,
the
automobile,
for
better
or
worse,
has
become
the
very
focus
of
modern
society.
a
man’s
home
very
often
is
a
series
of
rented
apartments,
motel
rooms,
even
in
a
growing
number
of
cases,
the
vehicle
itself.
and
to
a
very
high
proportion
of
our
citizens,
it
seems
to
me
that
an
automobile
may
well
be
a
person’s
most
tangible
domain.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
whether
you
start
at
the
outset
and
say
automobiles
are
to
be
set
apart
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
whether
you
say
that
they
are
included
in
fourth
amendment
coverage,
but
the
way
in
which
we
deal
with
them
may
have
to
be
different
based
on
their
mobility.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
i
would.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
sir.
i
would
submit
that
the
observations
that
i’ve
made
about
automobiles
are
not
merely
abstract
generalization,
but
relates
specifically
to
this
case
because
there
is
evidence
in
the
trial
record
to
the
effect
that
mr.
lewis,
because
he
had
three
businesses
and
taught,
virtually
lived
in
his
automobile
and
that
may
be
found
in
bill
of
exceptions,
page
889.
i
submit
that
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
there
were
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
there
was,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
i
would
take
the
position
that
scraping
is
an
entry
into
the
automobile
and,
also,
i
would
point
out
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
grant
you
that,
your
honor.
i
submit
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
so.
he
specifically
--
i
think
his
exact
words
in
the
transcript
were
that
he
lived
in
his
automobile
a
lot.
by
that,
he
meant
that
he
was
constantly
going
from
one
occupation
to
another
and
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
his
automobile.
i
submit
that
the
only
logical
and
adaptable
concept
to
the
fourth
amendment
is
that
it
be
held
to
protect
one’s
sphere
of
existence,
whatever
that
may
in
an
individual
case
may
be.
i
think
this
is
precisely
the
approach
that
the
court
has
taken.
in
terry,
the
court
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
inestimable
right
of
personal
security
belongs
as
much
to
the
citizens
on
the
street
as
to
the
homeowner
closeted
in
his
study
to
dispose
of
his
secret
affairs.
i
think
that
the
katz
case
is
yet
another
example
where
this
court
has
dealt
not
with
a
proprietary
interest,
but
in
an
interest
in
one’s
sphere
of
existence.
here,
lewis
did
seek
privacy
in
his
automobile,
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
he
put
his
car
into
a
commercial
parking
lot
to
make
it
safe
from
the
vulnerability
of
public
areas.
he
did
not
abandon
his
car
in
a
way
that
the
defendant
did
in
cady
versus
dombrowski.
but
even
if
you
grant
the
amicus
--
the
assumption
that
there
is
somehow
some
inherent
inferiority
in
an
automobile,
the
result
which
he
projects
from
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
mystifying.
he
suggests
that
since
we
have
declared
automobiles
to
be
second
class
effects
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
what
we
ought
to
do
is
give
them
a
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
he
arbitrarily
picks,
i
think,
the
first
part,
the
reasonableness
clause
and
he
proposes
to
substitute
a
policeman’s
ad
hoc
judgment
for
the
second,
the
warrant
requirement.
he
seems
to
see
this
as
a
way
of
balancing
interests,
but
yet,
he
never
once
points
to
interest,
the
police
interest
that
needs
to
be
balanced.
respondent
would
submit
that
there
is
no
need
for
and
much
mischief
to
be
expected
from
this
kind
of
concept.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
choice
or
if
there
is
a
choice
between
perspective
and
retrospective
judicial
determinations
of
probable
cause,
it
should
be
made
in
favor
of
prospective
probable
cause
in
determinations,
not
only
because
the
constitution
dictates
it,
but
because
good
sense
does
as
well.
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
i’m
speaking
of
going
to
a
magistrate
in
the
first
instance
and
securing
a
warrant
as
opposed
to
going
ahead,
making
the
search,
and
then
later
in
court
justifying
the
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
there
is
no
question
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
he
has
on
the
basis,
your
honor,
that
those
courts
improperly
applied
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
the
constitutional
principles
involved.
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
that
i
do
not
suggest
here
that
the
positions
urged
by
the
state,
by
the
solicitor
general
and
by
the
last
rights
in
the
fourth
amendment.
but
they
do,
as
excursions
from
the
general
thrust
of
that
basic
guarantee
always
to
heighten
the
potential
for
abuse
of
a
citizen
by
his
government.
in
some
instances
that
risk
may
be
worth
the
taking.
but
here,
it
was
not
necessary
and
it
is
not
worth
the
taking.
and
i
would
urge
the
affirmance
of
the
decisions
below.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
read
the
briefs
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
of
the
solicitor
general
and
as
i
listen
to
the
oral
arguments
of
my
brothers
mr.
frey
and
mr.
conway,
i
am
struck
repeatedly
by
the
aptness
of
the
observation
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent
in
rabinowitz.
and
i
paraphrase
to
some
extent
here
that,
“where
one
comes
out
on
a
case
depends
very
much
on
where
one
goes
in.
and
that
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
whether
one
approaches
the
fourth
amendment
as
a
safeguard
against
recurrent
abuses
or
merely
as
a
provision
dealing
with
a
formality.”
it
seemed
to
me
that
both
the
petitioner
and
the
amicus
in
this
case
seem
to
take
as
granted
that
it
is
somehow
automatically
desirable
that,
as
many
areas
as
possible
to
be
excised
from
fourth
amendment
protection
and
that
police
action
wherever
possible
be
taken
out
from
under
the
coverage
of
that
amendment.
and
they
do
that
in
this
case
without
devoting
in
their
briefs
or
in
their
oral
argument
a
single
word
as
to
why
there
was,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
a
specific
burden
upon
law
enforcement
a
specific
risk
to
be
taken
by
the
procuring
of
a
warrant
in
this
case.
and
they
also
do
this
it
seems
to
me,
without
stopping
to
consider
the
potentiality
for
executive
abuse
that
is
inherent
in
the
positions
which
they
urge.
respondent,
of
course,
approaches
this
case
from
the
perspective
of
the
very
fundamental
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
would
like
before
i
begin
to
clear
up,
i
think,
some
factual
difficulties
that
have
arisen
from
oral
argument.
mr.
conway,
i
think,
has
supplied
some
details
of
the
murder
itself
which
are
at
least
speculative
in
the
record
and
i
think
that
there
are
some
other
inaccuracies
that
should
be
corrected.
first
of
all,
it
is
claimed
that
the
witness
at
the
--
near
the
murder
scene
who
saw
the
departing
automobile
claimed
it
to
have
been
a
gold
‘67
or
‘68
oldsmobile.
in
fact,
she
said
that
it
was
tan
or
beige
car
that
it
was
of
a
make
similar
to
her
own
corvette
but
she
was
not
aware
of
what
specific
brand
of
car
it
was.
secondly,
with
regard
to
the
phone
call
that
was
received
by
the
wife
of
the
person
who
was
purchasing
the
business,
mr.
smith,
who
had
hired
the
decedent,
mr.
radcliffe,
to
examine
the
books.
the
record
of
the
case
will
disclose
that
the
caller,
whoever
that
caller
may
have
been,
did
not
specifically
say
“i
have
examined
the
books
of
grahams
auto
parts,”
which
was
the
name
of
the
business
that
the
defendant
was
attempting
to
sell
to
mr.
smith.
it
merely
said
--
that
witness
at
the
trial
merely
claimed
that
the
caller
said
“i
have
examined
the
books
and
they
are
in
a
one
shape.”
now,
it
is
also
fact
in
the
record
that
the
accountant
was
the
general
accountant
for
mr.
smith,
not
just
the
accountant
for
the
specific
purpose
of
this
particular
transaction.
so,
i
think
that
the
state
has
inferred
more
than
it
should
from
that
telephone
call.
and
one
final
matter;
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
person
searching
the
car
on
the
day
it
was
seized
did
not
intrude
upon
the
interior
of
that
car.
in
fact,
he
did,
he
opened
the
trunk
of
that
car
and
looked
in
and
observed
a
nearly
new
tire
and
he
testified
about
this
at
trial.
now,
the
reason
that
that
has
not
been
emphasized
in
this
appeal
or
throughout
the
course
of
this
case
is
that
there
was
other
testimony
concerning
the
tires,
whereas,
the
only
testimony
concerning
the
paint
came
as
the
result
of
the
taking
of
the
paint
from
the
automobile
at
the
time
of
the
search.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have,
here,
essentially
two
distinct
characterizations
of
the
case.
the
state
of
ohio
says
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
almost
all
of
the
traditional
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
were
present.
they
claim
consent.
they
claim
that
there
was
incidency
to
the
arrest.
they
claim
that
there
was
urgency
of
circumstance
that
necessitated
a
warrantless
seizure.
the
solicitor
general
takes
quite
a
different
view.
he
says
he
explicitly
denies
that
there
were
exigent
circumstances
here
and
he
tacitly
seems
to
concede
that
there
was
no
consent
and
no
incidency
to
the
arrest.
but
he
argues
that
one
has
less
than
a
full-fledged
fourth
amendment
interest
in
his
automobile
and
that
the
scraping
of
the
paint
in
this
case
was
not
a
seizure
as
such.
with
respect
to
probable
cause,
there
seems
also
to
be
a
disagreement.
the
solicitor
general
has
urged
unquestionably
that
there
was
probable
cause,
although
he
does
not
explain
this
at
any
point.
the
state
of
ohio
seems
to
be
in
doubt.
in
its
own
conclusion,
at
page
35
of
its
brief
it
states
that
while
the
authorities
in
our
case
had
information
relating
to
the
car
prior
to
the
seizure,
there
is
no
indication
that
such
information
amounted
to
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
warrant.
i
propose
to
examine
in
turn,
first,
the
more
traditional
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
that
are
raised
primarily
by
the
state,
specifically
consent
search
incident
and
exigent
circumstances.
and
then,
move
to
what
i
perceive
to
be
the
more
novel
exception
which
the
state
indirectly
and
the
solicitor
general
more
specifically
has
asked
this
court
to
countenance.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
consent
in
this
case,
i
would
first
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
issue
is,
at
best,
clouded
upon
the
record.
there
are
essentially
two
versions
of
what
happened
on
october
10,
1967
which
was
the
day
when
the
defendant
was
asked
to
come
to
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
he
appeared,
he
was
questioned
throughout
the
day
despite
the
fact
that
the
officers
already
at
that
time
had
an
arrest
warrant
for
first-degree
murder
for
him.
a
tape
recording
was
made
of
that
interrogation
session,
and
i’ll
refer
to
that
later.
the
respondent
says
that,
at
that
time,
the
--
that
he
attempted
only
to
turnover
the
keys
and
the
claim
check
of
his
automobile
to
his
attorney,
mr.
scott
and
this
is
verified
by
his
two
attorneys,
mr.
tingly
who’s
the
first
attorney
and
mr.
scott
as
well.
mr.
tingly
testified
in
a
motion
to
suppress
hearing
prior
to
the
trial,
and
mr.
scott
testified
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court.
now,
the
investigating
officials
here
claim
that
what
happened
was
that
the
defendant
made
a
request
that
his
car
be
kept
for
“safekeeping,”
but
mr.
--
sergeant
lavery
himself
conceded
that
this
request
made
to
no
one
in
particular.
that
may
be
found
on
page
58a
of
the
appendix
and
he
seems
that
--
sergeant
lavery
seems
also
to
be
at
least
confused
as
to
when
exactly
this
occurred.
at
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress,
he
thought
that
it
was
probably
before
the
defendant’s
counsel
had
arrived
at
the
office
of
the
attorney
general.
subsequently,
at
the
evidentiary
hearing,
he
seemed
to
be
sure
that
it
was
after
counsel
had
arrived.
now,
the
district
court
examined
at
some
length,
i
think,
all
of
the
facts
surrounding
this
alleged
consent
and
determined
that
even
if
it
took
these
facts
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
state,
which
it
was
not
required
to
do
even
under
that
construction,
there
was
not
sufficient
consent
to
allow
the
taking
of
the
automobile
here.
the
state
courts
did
not
find
consent
either.
the
trial
court
rested
its
decision
on
a
search
incident
theory.
the
ohio
supreme
court
went
off
on
what
could
only
be
described
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
theory,
interestingly
enough,
never
even
citing
warden
versus
hayden
which
had
been
decided
some
two
years
prior
to
that.
the
burden
of
proving
consent
here
was
clearly
on
the
state,
as
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
and
most
recently
in
the
schneckloth
decision
and
in
the
matlock
decision.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
imply
a
full
waiver
of
fourth
amendment
constitutional
rights
from
what,
at
most,
coul
be
characterized
as
an
expression
of
concern
about
one’s
property
would
be
the
ultimate
paradox.
if
it
is
a
desirable
goal
to
foster
citizen
cooperation
with
investigation
--
with
law
investigation,
and
mr.
lewis
in
this
case
was
most
cooperative,
it
hardly
seems
to
be
in
furtherance
of
that
goal
to
allow
sweeping
interpretations
to
be
made
of
a
simple
request
of
the
nature
of
the
warrant
here.
now,
perhaps,
one
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
in
the
brief
for
the
state
of
ohio,
consent
is
raised
at
least
in
the
way
that
the
state
presents
its
case.
and
consent
is
raised
in
another
way
by
the
solicitor
general.
he
proposes
that
though
there
may
not
have
been
enough
consent
here
for
a
seizure
of
the
automobile,
there
was
somehow
enough
consent
that
the
automobile
could
be
taken
into
custody
and
then
searched.
i
submit
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
solicitor
general’s
brief
that
it
is
something
of
an
argument
in
passing,
but
he
does
raise
the
possibility
that
there
may
have
been
sufficient
consent
here
to
merit
a
taking
into
custody
and
then
he
argues
from
that
that
what
followed
was
not
really
a
search
at
all
and
that
it
was
justified
very
much
in
the
line
that
this
court
justified
cooper.
i
submit
that
this
is
pure
sophistry,
that
consent
to
search
is
certainly
no
different
than
consent
to
take
into
custody.
now,
with
respect
to
the
incidence
to
arrest,
the
petitioner
here
proposes
a
nexus
between
the
arrest
and
car
seizure
based
not
upon
the
physical
proximity
of
the
defendant
and
his
automobile,
but
rather
upon
his
possession
at
the
moment
of
arrest
of
a
parking
lot
claim
check
for
the
car
and
perhaps
the
keys.
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
a
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
whether
mr.
lewis
had
the
keys
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
or
not.
mr.
lewis
says
that
he
did.
other
witnesses
said
only
the
claim
check
was
apparently
turned
over
and
it
may
have
been
a
parking
lot
where
the
keys
were
kept
at
the
parking
lot.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
none,
your
honor,
from
my
point
of
view.
in
effect,
i
think
the
petitioner
is
urging
a
doctrine
of
constructive
possession
whereby
what
one
has
on
his
possession,
if
it
is
a
part
of
or
a
means
of
access
to,
some
other
object,
will
allow
the
state
then
to
seize
that
other
object
no
matter
where
it
may
be.
i
believe
this
to
be
an
absurd
extension
of
the
search
incidency
doctrine
and
that
it
is
founded
upon
no
prior
case
law.
it
seemed
to
me,
as
the
district
court
held,
that
incidency
in
this
case
must
be
judged
upon
(inaudible)
standards
that
rabinowitz
is
probably
the
controlling
case,
but
even
in
rabinowitz
the
court
held
that
--
held
only
that
a
tiny
office
in
which
the
defendant
was
arrested
and
which
was
under
his
immediate
and
complete
control
could
be
searched.
the
preston
case
which,
again,
was
decided
before
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
case
occurred,
involved
an
automobile
on
the
street
and,
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
once
an
accused
is
under
arrest
and
in
custody,
then
a
search
made
at
another
place
without
a
warrant
is
simply
not
incident
to
the
arrest.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i’m
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
believe
that
that
case
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
this
case.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
the
warrant
would
be
required.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
would
think
so.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
because
the
key
does
not
subsume
the
identity
of
the
object
to
which
it
admits
one.
i
might
have
in
my
possession
the
combination
to
a
safe.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
means
that
that
safe,
if
it
can
be
located,
can
be
opened
merely
because
i
had
a
list
of
numbers
in
my
pocket.
there
is
nothing
about
the
key
in
the
example
that
you
pose
that
takes
over
the
identity
of
the
object
that
is
later
searched
and
seized.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
believe
that
they
would
have
to
have
a
warrant,
your
honor,
under
the
same
rational.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
and
i
do
take
that
position.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
would
think
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
the
seizure
of
the
car
key
was
tantamount
to
the
seizure
of
the
car
itself,
then
the
logical
extension
of
that
would
be
that
the
seizure
of
the
house
key
was
indeed
the
seizure
of
the
house.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
at
the
parking
lot,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
your
honor,
i
would
make
no
distinction
in
this
case
between
the
parking
on
a
commercial
parking
lot
and
the
parking
in
any
area
that
is
legally
designated
for
the
parking
of
an
automobile.
i
don’t
think
that
this
case
turns
upon
the
private
nature
of
the
parking
lot.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
your
honor,
as
long
as
that
car
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
the
thing
that’s
wrong
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that,
in
my
view
it
is
a
seizure
and,
as
such,
it
should
have
been
justified
by
a
warrant
if
indeed
there
was
time
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
quite
possibly,
yes.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
the
can
of
paint,
i
would
take
it,
would
not
be
an
integral
part
of
the
car
itself
and
not
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
that
seems
to
be
his
position.
i
disagree
with
that
position.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
because
it
is
an
integral
part
of
that
house.
it
is
not
something
in
plain
view.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
there
is
at
the
point
after
the
seizure.
once
the
paint
is
seized,
it
is
then
examined,
and
that
becomes
the
search.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
are
helpful
here.
chambers
versus
maroney
merely
said
that
where
the
antecedent
seizure
at
the
site
of
the
arrest
would
validate
a
search,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
move
the
car
to
a
safe
place.
but
here,
unlike
chambers,
we
did
not
have
a
vehicle
stopped
on
the
open
road.
we
had
not
need
to
divert
man
power
from
the
arrest
function
to
the
search
function.
and
here,
the
search,
in
any
event,
was
not
completed
as
was
the
search
in
chambers
versus
maroney
as
soon
as
it
was
reasonably
practical.
neither
are
the
robinson
and
gustafson
case,
cases
recently
decided
by
this
court,
helpful
here
because,
in
those
cases,
the
court
dealt
with
a
very
direct
physical
relationship
between
the
one
arrested
and
the
object
on
his
person.
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
at
some
considerable
distance
from
his
car
at
the
time
of
arrest.
he
had
been
out
of
his
car
for
at
least
seven
hours
by
the
time
of
the
arrest.
he
had
no
means
of
getting
to
it
and,
during
the
day,
he
was
held
in
closed
confinement.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
your
honor,
first,
let
me
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
was
required
in
this
case.
but
if
it
had
been,
i
do
not
believe
that
would
have
constituted
a
full
seizure
of
the
car.
i
realize
that
there
is
a
problem
here,
and
it
is
a
problem
which
the
court
wrestled
with
in
chambers
versus
maroney.
but
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
court
should
examine,
perhaps,
the
possibility
that
that
lesser
intrusion
may
solve
some
very
difficult
search
problems
in
this
area.
i
am
aware
that
guard-posting
is
a
theory
that
this
court
has
not
generally
countenanced,
although
i
think
recently
in
the
cady
versus
dombrowski
case
there
was
some
suggestion
that
perhaps
what
might
be
reasonable
in
a
metropolitan
jurisdiction
where
the
magistrate
is
readily
available
and
there
are
other
police
officers
on
the
scene
might
not
be
reasonable
in
a
rural
setting.
here,
i
think,
we
had
a
very
good
case
for
guard-posting
if
it
were
necessary.
but
as
i
say,
it
was
not
necessary
in
this
case.
the
car
was
effectively
immobilized.
this,
i
think,
brings
me
to
the
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
that
kind
of
temporary
keeping
for
a
reasonable
time
while
a
warrant
is
sought
from
a
seizure
itself
and
i
believe
that
that
kind
of
distinction
might
be
helpful
in
another
case,
but
i
don’t
believe
that
it
was
the
reality
of
this
case
and
necessary
here.
petitioner
has
also
claimed
exigency
of
circumstance
or
urgency,
here,
necessitating
the
warrantless
seizure
of
this
automobile.
he
rests
his
claim,
i
think,
on
three
assumptions.
first
of
all,
that
the
investigators
did
not
know
where
the
car
was.
second,
that
confederates
may
have
absconded
with
the
car.
and
finally,
that
probable
cause,
if
it
existed
at
all,
did
not
come
into
being
until
the
moment
of
arrest.
i’d
like
to
take
each
one
of
these
claims
in
turn,
if
i
may.
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
car,
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
state
did
not
know
at
many
times
throughout
this
investigation
where
the
car
was.
in
fact,
they
had
very
specific
knowledge
about
the
car
and
had
seen
the
car
78
days
prior
to
october
10.
they
went
to
the
defendant’s
place
of
business.
they
asked
him
where
his
car
was.
it
was
in
the
parking
lot.
he
pointed
it
to
them
--
pointed
it
out
to
them.
they
had
an
opportunity
to
note
its
color
and
did,
in
fact,
at
that
moment,
begin
to
consider
him
as
a
suspect
because
the
color
of
the
car
matched
the
one
that
they
already
were
looking
for.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
any
doubt
that
the
court
might
have
about
the
specificity
of
the
information
which
the
state
had
by
the
time
of
october
10
concerning
the
defendant,
his
car,
his
home,
his
general
whereabouts,
his
businesses,
his
financial
condition
can
easily
be
dispelled
by
reading
in
the
bill
of
exceptions,
the
transcription
of
the
interrogation
session
which
took
place
on
october
10.
you
will
remember
that
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
a
tape
recording
was
made
unknown
to
the
defendant
of
that
interrogation
session.
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
state
attempted
to,
first,
introduce
this
transcript
into
the
record.
this
was
objected
to
and
the
objection
was
sustained,
but
then,
the
trial
judge
allowed
one
of
the
states’
witnesses,
mr.
mann,
to
read
verbatim
into
the
record
the
record
of
that
transcription
of
the
interrogation
session
and
that
may
be
found
on
page
485
to
568
of
the
bill
of
exceptions.
throughout
that
interrogation
session,
it
is
clear
that
they
had
very
specific
knowledge
about
where
mr.
lewis
had
been,
who
he
had
talked
to,
where
his
car
was,
where
his
home
was.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
your
honor,
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
his
home
was
in
franklin
county
or
delaware
county.
he
moved
between
the
two
frequently,
and
i
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
if
it
does,
i’m
sorry.
i
don’t
know
for
sure.
there
is
talk
in
the
record
that
i
just
told
you
about
as
to
where
--
there
is
a
dialogue
between
the
investigator
and
mr.
lewis
about
his
home,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
says
where
he
lived.
as
in
the
side,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
record
of
that
interrogation
is
instructive
in
its
own
right
of
why,
as
the
court
has
said
from
time
to
time,
zealous
officers
engaged
in
the
enterprise
of
ferreting
out
crime
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
ad
hoc
judgments
about
probable
cause
matters.
that
was
a
brutal
interrogation
session,
not
in
a
physical
sense
but
in
a
mental
sense.
during
the
course
of
that
interrogation,
the
state
repeatedly
tried
to
get
the
defendant
to
take
a
lie
detector
test
although,
at
the
very
first
instance,
the
defendant
said
he
would
not
even
consider
it
without
talking
to
counsel.
and
in
another
place
in
the
record
of
that
interrogation,
the
interrogator
attempts
to
help
mr.
lewis
fabricate
a
non-premeditative
version
of
the
facts
of
this
killing
in
order
that
he
might
not
have
to
charge
him
with
first-degree
murder,
not
telling
him
that
a
first-degree
murder
warrant
was
already
in
existence.
now,
with
respect
to
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
confederate
in
this
crime,
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
that
shows
that
there
ever
was
an
accomplice,
that
the
state
ever
believed
that
there
was
an
accomplice,
that
the
defendant’s
family
was
in
any
way
in
league
with
the
defendant
or
would
have
removed
the
car.
and
as
to
mr.
scott,
the
attorney,
it
seems
to
me
that
once
mr.
scott
turned
over
the
claim
check
and
perhaps
the
keys
to
the
police
that,
at
that
point
in
time,
he
indicated
that
he
was
not
going
to
run
a
footrace
with
the
investigators
down
to
the
car
and
he
indicated
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
the
car.
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
car
would
be
taken
out
of
the
jurisdiction.
now,
the
final
assumption,
i
think,
is
--
deals
with
the
question
of
probable
cause.
now,
the
state
claims
here
that
there
may
not
have
been
probable
cause
up
to
october
10
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
the
automobile.
but
then,
it
seems
to
claim
that
somehow
during
the
day
something
developed
that
made
the
probable
cause
argument
and
made
the
seizure
possible.
but
the
only
fact
that
they’ve
suggested
that
has
emerged
during
that
interrogation
on
october
10
was
the
fact
that
the
defendant
gave
a
slightly
different
version
of
why
he
had
had
his
car
repaired
than
he
did
when
he
had
it
repaired.
now,
there
is
no
showing
by
the
petitioner
why
this
tiny
fact,
added
to
the
others
that
the
police
had,
somehow
became
the
sine
qua
non
of
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
he
was
there
from
10
o’clock
in
the
morning
until
arrested
at
5:30
with
the
exception
of
a
brief
period
when
he
left
in
the
company
of
the
officers
and
went
to
his
home
and
with
his
own
consent,
he
searched
his
house
for
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
i
still
don’t
know
precisely
whether
the
house
was
in
delaware
county
or
franklin
county.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
mr.
conway
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
other
than
the
transcript
that
we
have
of
that
interrogation,
no
or
do
i
understand
your
question
correctly?
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
we
have
a
trans--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
we
have
what
the
state
has
claimed
to
be
an
accurate
transcript
of
the
questioning
that
took
place
starting
about
10:30
until
about
3:00
in
the
afternoon
when
--
or
3:30
in
the
afternoon,
when
mr.
lewis
finally
said
that
“i
want
a
lawyer.”
and
at
that
point,
questioning
apparently
was
broken
off
and
that’s
the
end
of
the
transcript.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
the
only
--
yes,
that’s
the
only
thing
that
emerged
during
that.
and
it’s
interesting
to
point
out
that
that
emerged
quite
early
in
the
record
of
that
interrogation,
probably
early
in
the
morning,
so
that
they
had
at
least
the
afternoon
to
obtain
a
warrant.
turning,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
raised
by
the
amicus
in
this
case,
it
would
seem
to
argue
to
this
court
that
somehow
an
individual’s
privacy
interest
in
his
automobile,
at
least
when
it’s
not
parked
at
home,
is
not
of
sufficient
intensity
to
necessitate
full
invocation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
would,
first,
examine
the
assumption
that
he
makes
that
individuals
do
not
expect
in
an
automobile
the
same
kind
of
security
interest
that
they
do
in
other
objects
of
their
life.
certainly,
there
is
no
basis
in
the
fourth
amendment
to
differentiate
between
an
automobile
and
other
effects.
the
solicitor
general
cites
no
empirical
data
suggesting
that
americans
do
not
expect
a
privacy
interest
in
their
automobiles.
and,
the
only
case
law
which
he
cites
is
a
52-year-old
michigan
case
dealing
with
a
car
that
was
found
upon
fairgrounds.
i
submit
that
the
assumption
that,
in
1974,
we
do
not
expect
the
same
privacy
interest
with
respect
to
our
automobiles
that
we
do
with
respect
to
other
accouterments
of
our
life
is
simply
unfounded.
it
might
be
or
it
might
have
been
a
valid
assumption
in
a
more
pastoral
age
when
people
led
a
self-contained
existence
on
their
own
homestead.
but
today,
if
anything,
the
automobile,
for
better
or
worse,
has
become
the
very
focus
of
modern
society.
a
man’s
home
very
often
is
a
series
of
rented
apartments,
motel
rooms,
even
in
a
growing
number
of
cases,
the
vehicle
itself.
and
to
a
very
high
proportion
of
our
citizens,
it
seems
to
me
that
an
automobile
may
well
be
a
person’s
most
tangible
domain.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
whether
you
start
at
the
outset
and
say
automobiles
are
to
be
set
apart
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
whether
you
say
that
they
are
included
in
fourth
amendment
coverage,
but
the
way
in
which
we
deal
with
them
may
have
to
be
different
based
on
their
mobility.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
i
would.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
sir.
i
would
submit
that
the
observations
that
i’ve
made
about
automobiles
are
not
merely
abstract
generalization,
but
relates
specifically
to
this
case
because
there
is
evidence
in
the
trial
record
to
the
effect
that
mr.
lewis,
because
he
had
three
businesses
and
taught,
virtually
lived
in
his
automobile
and
that
may
be
found
in
bill
of
exceptions,
page
889.
i
submit
that
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
there
were
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
there
was,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
i
would
take
the
position
that
scraping
is
an
entry
into
the
automobile
and,
also,
i
would
point
out
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
grant
you
that,
your
honor.
i
submit
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
so.
he
specifically
--
i
think
his
exact
words
in
the
transcript
were
that
he
lived
in
his
automobile
a
lot.
by
that,
he
meant
that
he
was
constantly
going
from
one
occupation
to
another
and
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
his
automobile.
i
submit
that
the
only
logical
and
adaptable
concept
to
the
fourth
amendment
is
that
it
be
held
to
protect
one’s
sphere
of
existence,
whatever
that
may
in
an
individual
case
may
be.
i
think
this
is
precisely
the
approach
that
the
court
has
taken.
in
terry,
the
court
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
inestimable
right
of
personal
security
belongs
as
much
to
the
citizens
on
the
street
as
to
the
homeowner
closeted
in
his
study
to
dispose
of
his
secret
affairs.
i
think
that
the
katz
case
is
yet
another
example
where
this
court
has
dealt
not
with
a
proprietary
interest,
but
in
an
interest
in
one’s
sphere
of
existence.
here,
lewis
did
seek
privacy
in
his
automobile,
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
he
put
his
car
into
a
commercial
parking
lot
to
make
it
safe
from
the
vulnerability
of
public
areas.
he
did
not
abandon
his
car
in
a
way
that
the
defendant
did
in
cady
versus
dombrowski.
but
even
if
you
grant
the
amicus
--
the
assumption
that
there
is
somehow
some
inherent
inferiority
in
an
automobile,
the
result
which
he
projects
from
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
mystifying.
he
suggests
that
since
we
have
declared
automobiles
to
be
second
class
effects
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
what
we
ought
to
do
is
give
them
a
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
he
arbitrarily
picks,
i
think,
the
first
part,
the
reasonableness
clause
and
he
proposes
to
substitute
a
policeman’s
ad
hoc
judgment
for
the
second,
the
warrant
requirement.
he
seems
to
see
this
as
a
way
of
balancing
interests,
but
yet,
he
never
once
points
to
interest,
the
police
interest
that
needs
to
be
balanced.
respondent
would
submit
that
there
is
no
need
for
and
much
mischief
to
be
expected
from
this
kind
of
concept.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
choice
or
if
there
is
a
choice
between
perspective
and
retrospective
judicial
determinations
of
probable
cause,
it
should
be
made
in
favor
of
prospective
probable
cause
in
determinations,
not
only
because
the
constitution
dictates
it,
but
because
good
sense
does
as
well.
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
well,
i’m
speaking
of
going
to
a
magistrate
in
the
first
instance
and
securing
a
warrant
as
opposed
to
going
ahead,
making
the
search,
and
then
later
in
court
justifying
the
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
there
is
no
question
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
he
has
on
the
basis,
your
honor,
that
those
courts
improperly
applied
--
mr.
bruce
a.
campbell
the
constitutional
principles
involved.
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
that
i
do
not
suggest
here
that
the
positions
urged
by
the
state,
by
the
solicitor
general
and
by
the
last
rights
in
the
fourth
amendment.
but
they
do,
as
excursions
from
the
general
thrust
of
that
basic
guarantee
always
to
heighten
the
potential
for
abuse
of
a
citizen
by
his
government.
in
some
instances
that
risk
may
be
worth
the
taking.
but
here,
it
was
not
necessary
and
it
is
not
worth
the
taking.
and
i
would
urge
the
affirmance
of
the
decisions
below.
