i

argument
directed
to
distinguishing
this
case
from

where
in

to
take

in
the
coolidge
case,
they
had
to
invade
at
least
the
privacy
of
the
man’s
home
and
dwelling
and
garage
and
here,
it
was
a
private
parking
lot
and
no
expectation
of
that
kind
of
privacy?
chief

e.

very
well,
mr.

mr.
campbell.
chief
justice
warren
e.

would
it
make

our
questions
here,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
give
you
a
slight
variation
of
justice
stewart’s
hypothetical.
instead
of
a
key
to
locker
at
a
train
station
or
airport
or
some
such
place,
they
found
a
pawnshop
ticket
dated
two
days
before
the
time
of
the
interview.
and
the
pawnshop
ticket
showed
that
a
pistol
had
been
pawned
and
police
were
involved
in
trying
to
check
out
pistols
and
ballistic
tests.
you
think
the
police
with
that
pawnshop
ticket
could
go
to
the
pawnshop
without
a
warrant
or
would
they
have
to
have
a
warrant
to
go
and
get
that
gun
to
test
it
for
ballistics?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
really
got
to
take
that
position
or
abandon
your
own
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
don’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
courts
made
some
distinctions
between
automobiles
and
homes,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
between
keys?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
after
they
got
the
keys
and
the
ticket
to
the
parking
lot
so
that
the
police
had
access,
they
had
then
placed
four
policemen
over
on
the
parking
lot
with
orders
to
the
parking
lot
attendant
not
to
permit
anyone
to
take
that
car
away
and
informing
the
attendant
that
they
were
there
to
enforce
that
direction.
then
--
meanwhile,
proceeded
to
get
a
warrant.
would
you
think
a
seizure
would’ve
occurred
when
they
put
the
guard
on
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
make
that
analysis,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
a
moment
more,
to
make
that
analysis
that
you’ve
just
made
you
must
confront
the
situation
that
while
the
four
policemen
were
standing
guard
on
the
car
on
this
restriction
on
its
movement,
some
member
of
the
family
or
some
other
person
came
to
the
parking
lot
with
a
set
of
keys,
made
claim
to
the
car
and
sought
to
take
it
away.
in
which
case,
obviously,
the
only
purpose
of
having
a
police
guard
there
would
be
to
prevent
it.
with
that
confrontation,
would
you
have
a
seizure?

the
police
