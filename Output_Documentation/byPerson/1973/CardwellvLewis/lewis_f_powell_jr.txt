mr.
campbell,
may
i
ask
you
a
very
different
question
before
you
sit
down.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there’s
no
question
in
this
case,
is
there,
that
the
fourth
amendment
issue
that
you’ve
been
arguing
was
considered
at
every
stage
of
the
state
court
proceedings?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
those
proceedings
included
the
trial
court
and
the
intermediate
appellate
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
single
federal
district
judge
just
set
all
of
that
aside?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
what
basis
is.
