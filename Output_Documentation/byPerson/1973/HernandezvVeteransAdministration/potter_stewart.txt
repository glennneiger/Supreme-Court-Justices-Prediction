justice

stewart
what’s
the
jurisdictional
basis
of
the
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
are
both
were
cited
on
the
line
on
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
relief
requested
was
what?
justice
potter
stewart
a
mandamus?
was
a
mandamus
request?
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
the
complaint
appear
here
in
these
papers,
can
you
tell?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don’t
know
where
it
is
in
the
papers
we
have.
justice
potter
stewart
but
where,
in
your
submission
is
there
a
right
to
a
hearing,
in
the
agency?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
a
--
in
other
words,
your
argument
would
cover
this
situation.
i
could
go
into
federal
court
and
attack
the
constitutionality
--
i
could
go
into
a
federal
court
and
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
program
for
aid
to
mothers
with
dependent
children
saying
that
while
i’m
not
a
mother,
and
that
i
don’t
have
dependent
children,
i
am
a
father
whose
children
are
independent
and
nonetheless
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
to
me
and
there’s
some
ground
of
independent
jurisdiction
based
on
this
kind
of
a
claim
that
i
am
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’d
be
seeking
the
benefits
that
are
given
to
mothers
with
dependent
children
on
the
proposition
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
doesn’t
give
it
to
me
who
is
a
father
with
independent
children?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
--
i
would
have
a
good
faith
claim.
it
might
be
quite
wrong
but
i
would
be
believed
in
it
by
hypothesis.
justice
potter
stewart
how
and
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
should
be
contention
too
in
my
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
constitution
itself
confers
jurisdiction
upon
a
district
court
and
compels
the
district
court
to
give
me
a
hearing
on
that
question,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
roth
was
a
constitutional
decision,
wasn’t
it
and
you
are
relying
on
roth.
justice
potter
stewart
not
roth
against
the
united
states,
but
roth
against
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’d
be
relying
on
the
legislation
that
gives
aid
to
mothers
with
dependent
children.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
anybody
is
entitled
to
make
a
claim
for
anything
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
duty
of
the
federal
court
to
grant
you
a
hearing
on
this
claim,
as
against
legislation
of
the
congress
that
seems
on
its
face
at
least
to
say
that
the
decisions
of
the
veterans’
administration
are
unreviewable
in
these
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
claim
--
excuse
me,
that
this
is
the
way
i
understand
it.
you
say
the
statute,
as
properly
construed,
doesn’t
apply
this
kind
of
a
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
if
you
did
construe
the
statute
this
way,
it
would
deny
you
some
sort
of
a
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
your
complaint
also
grounded
on
28
united
states
code
section
1331?
justice
potter
stewart
what
section,
declaratory
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
to
review
again?
justice
potter
stewart
by
its
term.
justice
potter
stewart
and
on
what
basis
did
you
under
1331
allege
an
amount
of
controversy
of
more
than
$10,000
excluding
interest
and
cost?
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
in
the
hernandez
case?
justice
potter
stewart
representing
mr.
hernandez,
and
purportedly
all
those
similarly
situated?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would,
of
course,
the
dismissal
was
squarely,
as
i
understand
it
upon
the
basis
of
section
211
(a),
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
a
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals’
per
curiam
affirmance
that
there
might
be
something
so
egregiously
unconstitutional
that
the
constitutionality
of
211
(a)
itself
might
have
to
be
reconsidered
but
this
dismissal
wasn’t
on
the
basis
that
it
was
an
insubstantial
question,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
well,
because
of
211
(a),
didn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have,
as
you
know,
there’s
no
appendix
in
this
case
and
i
have
before
me,
except
for
the
page
16
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
the
court
of
appeals
characterization
of
what
the
district
court
did
saying
the
district
court
dismissed
the
plaintiff’s
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
under
211
(a).
justice
potter
stewart
this
can
be
any
court
that
211
(a)
is
valid,
couldn’t
it,
could
there?
three-judge
court,
one-judge
court,
or
10-man
judge
court,
211
(a)
says,
there
should
be
no
judicial
review.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
what’s
the
jurisdictional
basis
of
the
lawsuit?
justice

stewart
and
those
are
both

cited
on

you
don’t
know
where
it
is
in

papers
we
have.
justice

but
where,
in

is
there
a
