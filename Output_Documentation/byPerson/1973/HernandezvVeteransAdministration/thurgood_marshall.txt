the
statute
is
that
you
claim
as
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
says
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
that’s
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
maybe,
one
question
here,
in
your
record,
i
find
the
complaint
from
some
peter
miller
and
gary
lehn.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
that
done
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
gave
to
the
veterans’
administration
the
right
to
determine
constitutional
questions,
finally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn’t
that
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
va
decided
that
nobody
who
didn’t
go
overseas
shouldn’t
feel
to
like
--
how
would
you
touch
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
va
says,
you
can’t
get
veterans’
benefits
because
you
didn’t
go
overseas,
you
stayed
and
can’t
meet.
what
would
be
done
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no
under
this
present
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
you
get
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
roth
said
constitutional
dimension?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
because
of
the
treatment
of
the
evidence,
the
factual
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
not
a
constitutional
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
in
this
case,
if
the
administrator
just
deliberately
violates
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
he
is
the
only
man
in
the
government
who
goes
cut
free?
justice
thurgood
marshall
lynch
said
it
ain’t
constitutional;
it’s
an
arbitrary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
if
we
go
with
you
on
the
sovereign
immunity,
we
don’t
need
to
bother
with
211
then,
do
we?
and
let
me
just
waste
it,
definitely.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
sovereign
immunity
is
a
good
defense,
you
don’t
need
211.
so
congress
has
wasted
its
