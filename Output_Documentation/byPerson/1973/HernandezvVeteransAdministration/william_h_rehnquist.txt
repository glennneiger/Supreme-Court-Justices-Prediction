justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
curtice,
so
suppose
that
your
client
had
sought
a
benefit
and
the
veterans’
administration
was
denied
by
the
administrator
and
then
sought
to
challenge
it
in
the
district
court
not
on
the
grounds
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
but
on
the
grounds
that
the
administrator
had
unconstitutionally
discriminated
against
him
as
compared
with
other
similarly
situated
applicants.
do
you
think
this
211
would
permit
that
sort
of
review
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that’s
a
substantive
constitutional
right
you’re
talking
about
there,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
right
to
be
free
from
denial
of
equal
protection.
i
think
the
government
argues
here
and
to
me
with
some
persuasiveness
that
mr.
justice
stewart’s
opinions
in
perry
and
sindermann
are
basically
procedural
due
process
types
of
situations,
where
you
don’t
have
any
substantive
claim.
but
there,
you
have
to
show
some
sort
of
property
that’s
created
by
a
statute
but
you’re
not
attacking
really.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn’t
--
mr.
curtice,
isn’t
your
argument
basically
a
kind
of
independent
of
your
roth
contention
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
1331
confers
federal-question
jurisdiction,
you
alleged
$10,000
in
controversy,
you
alleged
a
substantive
constitutional
claim
and
that
the
statute
in
question
deprived
your
client’s
of
the
equal
protection
component
of
their
fifth
amendment
due
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
therefore,
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
of
the
1331
to
at
least
hear
your
claim,
quite
apart
from
any
roth?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn’t
the
administrative
procedure
act
exclude
the
case
where
review
is
precluded
by
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
that
the
administrator
were
sued
in
state
court
he
could
remove
to
federal
court,
couldn’t
he,
under
the
removal
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
norton,
what
if
the
petitioners
here
instead
of
having
presented
a
claim
to
the
administrator,
had
simply
gone
into
the
district
court
under
1331
and
1361
and
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
could
the
government
have
asserted
the
provision
of
211
(a)
as
a
defense
to
that
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
ultimate
question
in
this
ninth
circuit
case,
if
we
come
to
the
merits
at
all,
is
not
the
constitutionality
fell
on
the
act,
but
whether
the
question
that’s
constitutional
is
sufficiently
substantial
to
warrant
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it,
what
you’re
referring
to
is
the
339
fed.
supp.
xerox
in
the
very
back
of
the
petition,
which
has
judge
carter’s
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
