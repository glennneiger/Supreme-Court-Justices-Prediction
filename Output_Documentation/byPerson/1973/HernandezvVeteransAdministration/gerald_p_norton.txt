mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
lost
my
voice
to
a
cold
over
the
weekend.
and
if
i
don’t
come
across
loudly
often
times,
let
me
know,
i’ll
try
to
speak
out.
there
are
two
consolidated
cases
before
the
court
in
hernandez
presenting
the
same
issues
on
the
merits
and
on
jurisdiction
as
would
be
considered
also
in
the
robison
case
next
on
the
calendar.
we
don’t
have
an
extensive
factual
record
below
because
the
case
went
off
in
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
do
not
provide
substantial
background
about
the
plaintiffs
here.
we
do
know
that
they
did,
as
alleged,
serve
two
years
of
alternative
service
and
were
denied
benefits
when
they
applied
to
the
va
for
educational
benefits
provided
by
the
1966
veterans
readjustments
benefits
act.
i
think
i
will
start
by
turning
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
section
211
applies
here.
by
its
terms
it
says
that
a
decision
of
the
administrator
of
the
va
under
any
of
the
laws
administered
by
the
va
with
certain
exceptions
for
contractual
benefits,
not
involved
here,
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
and
no
other
official
or
any
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
or
power
to
review
such
a
decision.
now,
we
think
this
statute
clearly
covers
this
case
by
its
terms.
if
plaintiffs
are
seeking
here
to
review
a
decision
of
the
administrator
namely
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
benefits,
their
effort
to
get
out
of
the
terms
of
the
statute
really
involves
an
assertion
that
there
are
reasons
why
he
should
--
the
administrator
should
have
come
to
a
contrary
decision.
they
say,
he
should
have
decided
that
they
were
entitled
to
benefits
for
reasons
that
he
did
not
consider
namely
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
but
you
cannot
avoid
the
fact
that
these
cases
seek
to
review
a
decision
of
the
administrator
to
the
fact
that
they
were
not
entitled
the
benefits,
and
therefore
the
cases
are
squarely
within
the
terms
of
211.
now
to
appreciate
the
scope
of
preclusion
of
review
that
congress
intended,
i
think
it
is
important
to
trace
the
background
of
the
statute.
a
forerunner
of
211
was
enacted
in
1921
which
provided
that
the
director
of
the
veterans’
bureau,
then
administering
the
veterans’
benefits
laws,
adopted
after
world
war
i,
shall
decide
all
questions
arising
under
the
act.
now
in
the
silver
shine
case
and
a
series
of
decisions
in
the
1920s,
this
court
decided
that
while
any
questions
of
fact
were
not
subject
to
judicial
review
under
that
statute
that
a
question
of
law,
or
the
question
whether
the
administrator’s
decision
was
arbitrary
or
whether
there
was
any
evidence
whatever
to
support
the
decision
might
not
be
subject
to
the
preclusion.
then
in
1933
congress
enacted
the
economy
act.
it’s
part
of
the
effort
to
reduce
government
expenditures,
and
made
various
changes
in
the
veterans’
benefits
program,
and
in
that
statute
there
was
another
preclusion
provision
which
provided
that
all
decisions
of
the
administrator
under
the
provisions
of
law
for
non-contractual
benefits
shall
be
conclusive
on
all
questions
of
law
and
fact
and
no
official
or
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
review
those
decisions
by
mandamus
or
otherwise.
in
lynch
against
united
states
in
the
unanimous
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brandeis,
this
court
observed
that
the
1933
provision
was
obviously
intended
by
congress
to
eliminate
even
the
scope
of
review
that
the
court
have
previously
said
was
available
under
the
1921
act.
and
there
was
no
intimation
that
any
constitutional
program
was
presented
by
that
action.
indeed,
in
lynch,
the
court
discussed
at
some
length
the
enormous
power
that
congress
has
to
grant
or
withdraw
benefits
fortuitous
or
non-contractual
benefits
and
the
enormous
power
that
congress
has
to
grant
or
withdraw
a
forum
in
which
to
press
for
relief
under
a
statute
granting
such
benefits.
in
1957,
the
1933
provision
and
a
similar
provision
adopted
in
1940
were
combined
into
the
immediate
predecessor
of
211.
at
that
statute,
included
the
language
to
the
effect
that
the
administrator’s
decision
on
any
question
of
law
or
fact
concerning
a
claim
for
benefits
under
these
non-contractual
provision
was
conclusive
and
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
a
series
of
decisions
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
construed
211
as
not
precluding
review
of
a
decision
concerning
termination
or
reduction
of
benefits
distinguishing
between
claim
and
termination.
now,
this
led
congress
in
1970
to
amend
the
statute
retroactive
to
1940
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
congress
intended
that
all
decisions
of
the
administrator
under
the
provisions
of
the
statutes
providing
for
non-contractual
benefits
were
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
there
is
not.
there
is
some
indication
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
would
not
say
that
is
this
case
because
the
--
well
before
we
contend
that
the
va
has
decided
the
constitutional
question
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
sorry.
i
couldn’t
hear.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
under
the
statute
that
makes
that
distinction
or
on
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
the
cases
construing
the
present
statute
in
roth
against
united
states
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
an
example,
say
that
211
precludes
review
of
any
decision
even
where
it
is
claimed
that
the
administrator
committed
an
error
of
law
or
if
constitutional
dimension
in
applying
the
statute.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it
was
claimed
in
the
roth
case
that
the
decision
of
the
administrator
was
based
on
either
a
lack
of
evidence
or
in
which
the
claim
was
treated
resulted
in
a
denial
of
due
process
to
the
claimant.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
the
nature
of
that
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
was
the
allegation
and
the
court
said
even
without
allegation
of
the
denial
of
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
there’s
nothing
in
the
terms
of
211
that
makes
any
exception
for
that
situation
and
the
observation
of
the
court
in
the
lynch
case
where
they
said
that
the
similar
statute
eliminated
review
of
an
arbitrary
decision
by
the
administrator
would
lead
in
that
direction.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
think
you
can
enlarge
measure
or
acquaint
that
to
because
of
the
way
that
the
question
of
due
process
has
developed
to
the
often
interchangeable
with
arbitrary
action.
there
is
another
indication
of
the
congress’
intent
in
the
1933
economy
act
and
that
under
a
separate
provision
of
that
statute
involving
a
not
contractual
benefits
but
reduction
of
pay
to
certain
people.
congress
had
another
provision
precluding
judicial
review
but
except
in
cases
where
a
constitutional
issue
was
presented.
so
congress
knew
how
to
make
the
distinction
when
it
wanted
to
and
in
none
of
the
statutes
leading
up
to
211
has
it
as
it
done
so.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
211
(a)
would
not
seem
to
apply
on
its
face
because
it
would
not
be
--
if
the
administrator
have
taken
no
action
whatever
on
this
issue,
it
would
not
seem
that
there
would
be
a
decision
of
the
administrator
under
review.
there
would
be
other
questions
raised
in
such
a
suit
as
to
whether
it
was
premature,
whether
there
have
been
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
and
of
course
sovereign
immunity
or
another
basis
for
jurisdiction
would
be
additional
issue
that
would
have
to
be
confronted.
that
of
course
is
not
this
case.
the
desire
of
congress
to
preclude
judicial
review
in
this
area
seems
amply
justified
by
the
potentially
enormous
burden
that
review
of
va
decisions
would
place
on
the
court
it’s
in
that.
va
takes
about
15
million
adjudicative
actions
annually
and
the
board
of
veterans
appeals
alone
disposes
of
some
30,000
cases,
the
vast
majority
of
these
involve
claims
under
the
various
non-contractual
benefit
programs
that
are
the
subject
of
section
211
(a).
now,
the
plaintiffs
claim
that
if
the
suit
is
barred
that
they
are
denied
their
due
process
rights,
but
the
critical
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
they
never
really
face
up
to
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
protects
against
a
denial
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
and
it’s
this
court’s
decision
in
the
roth
case
indicates
every
person
who
seeks
some
benefit
or
is
disappointed
by
the
action
taken
by
government
concerning
him
does
not
have
the
basis
for
a
claim
under
the
fifth
amendment.
there
must
be
a
property
interest
of
some
sort
created
either
by
statute,
contract,
practice,
or
common
law.
the
plaintiffs
concede
that
under
the
statute
on
its
face,
they
have
no
property
interest
in
these
benefits.
they
try
to
construe
or
contend
that
the
statute
has
to
be
read
as
unconstitutional
if
it
does
not
extend
benefits
to
them,
and
therefore,
by
combining
the
constitution
and
the
statute,
they
have
a
property
interest
but
the
court
indicated
in
roth
that
the
constitution
does
not
create
property
interest.
and
that
approach
does
not
have
any
merit,
we
believe.
in
addition,
there
is
a
problem
that
if
the
claim
is
made
is
that
a
statute
unconstitutionally
distinguishes
between
the
groups
by
giving
something
to
one
and
taking
away
or
not
giving
to
someone
else,
all
the
plaintiffs
can
really
claim
is
that
that
distinction
is
invalid.
it
doesn’t
necessarily
follow
that
they
are
entitled
to
get
what
someone
else
got.
it
maybe
that
the
answer
is
that
the
court
or
the
benefit
should
not
have
been
extended
to
either
group
either
it
was
to
everyone
or
to
none,
so
that
the
constitution
itself,
even
in
conjunction
for
the
statute
does
not
give
them
a
right
to
benefits.
the
plaintiffs
have
contended
that
they
have
a
right
to
a
court
hearing
because
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
which
they
say,
basically
requires
that
a
federal
court
be
available
to
hear
any
and
all
constitutional
questions
that
may
be
raised.
now,
just
in
last
term
in
the
palmore
case,
this
court
rejected
the
proposition
that
congress
was
obliged
under
article
iii
to
vest
in
the
federal
courts
all
of
the
judicial
power
authorized
by
article
iii,
and
it
is
still
the
law
and
has
been
throughout
our
history
that
to
have
jurisdiction
in
a
court,
there
has
to
be
a
statute
extending
that
jurisdiction,
and
congress
has
the
power
to
grant
jurisdiction
and
has
power
to
limit
jurisdiction.
and
as
the
court
said
in
lynch,
the
power
knows
virtually
no
limits.
we
would
--
on
the
question
whether
211
applies
to
state
court
proceeding
if
that
has
not
previously
been
raised
in
this
case
as
this
case
arose
in
a
federal
court,
the
question
of
state
court
jurisdiction
over
a
case
like
this
is
one
that,
i
think,
would
require
additional
consideration.
it
is
certainly
not
the
position
of
the
veterans’
administration
that
all
these
cases
should
be
litigated
in
the
state
courts
and
if
a
case
were
filed
in
the
state
court,
there
would
be
a
question
of
sovereign
immunity
just
as
there
is
a
question
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
federal
courts.
to
determine
whether
there
would
be
state
court
jurisdiction
you
would
have
to
know
the
nature
of
the
proceeding,
the
nature
of
the
state
law,
and
the
relief
sought
and
other
matters
that
i
do
not
think
can
be
decided
in
the
abstract.
but
on
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity,
this
is
a
suit
against
the
veterans’
administration
by
name,
its
administrator
and
the
regional
administrator
concerning
the
actions
of
these
officials
in
the
course
of
their
duties.
the
relief
sought
would
require
the
affirmative
action
of
these
officials
in
turning
over
to
the
plaintiffs’
funds,
property,
money
that
is
unquestionably
belonging
to
the
united
states.
now
we
feel
that
this
brings
--
it
makes
the
case
squarely
one
against
the
united
states
in
substance
even
if
in
form
against
its
officials
and
under
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
in
the
larson
case,
i
assume
you
made
just
a
declaratory
judgment
request?
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
in
the
larson
case,
the
court
indicated
that
even
if
only
declaratory
relief
had
been
sought,
there
would
still
be
a
sovereign
immunity
problem.
indeed,
it
suggested
that
there
might
be
a
greater
one
because
there
would
be
a
--
could
be
a
binding
declaration
of
rights.
it
is
always
been
said
in
these
sovereign
immunity
cases
is
that
the
action
can
precede
against
the
officer
but
it
is
not
binding
against
the
government,
it’s
not
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
would
not
attempt
here
to
try
to
square
those
cases
with
all
of
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
which
the
court
has
recognized
as
not
an
area
of
perfect
logical
symmetry.
but
in
the
cases
where
the
courts
have
entertained
suits
against
officials
where
they
--
where
officials
of
the
united
states,
they
have
tended
to
involve
property
either
land
or
coal
or
something
tangible
which
there
was
a
claim
that
the
property
really
belong
to
the
plaintiff
and
that
this
officer
was
retaining
it
against
the
rights
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
question
of
possession
could
be
determined
as
between
the
two
with
the
question
to
ultimate
title
vis-a-vis
the
united
states
left
to
another
forum.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
if
the
court
will
hold
the
sovereign
immunity
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
wouldn’t
say
the
congress
has
wasted
its
time
because
there
maybe
suits
that
would
be
subject
to
211
that
would
not
necessary
be
subject
to
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
but
in
this
case,
given
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought
and
the
nature
of
the
parties,
we
say
that
it
is
barred
both
by
sovereign
immunity
and
211.
the
court
could,
if
it
so
chose,
resolve
this
case
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
statute
that
is
constitutional
without
necessarily
reaching
the
merits.
this
was
the
approach
taken
in
brooks
against
doe
where
a
difficult
question
was
raised
concerning
a
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court
to
grant
relief
against
the
federal
official
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
the
court
said
that
where
the
plaintiffs’
claim
was
lacking
in
substance,
it
wasn’t
essential
to
reach
that
difficult
jurisdictional
issue,
because
they
could
affirm
on
the
merits.
that
is
the
position
we
would
take
here
and
that
the
court
can
affirm
in
this
case
on
either
ground.
of
course
if
the
court
is
going
to
reject
our
position
in
the
robison
case
on
the
merits,
it’s
essential
that
it
resolve
both
jurisdiction
and
the
question
on
the
merits.
now
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
yes,
that’s
exactly
my
next
point
that
the
alternative
or
the
second
point
decided
by
the
district
court
in
hernandez
was
that
after
holding
that
211
barred
jurisdiction,
the
court
also
denied
the
request
for
a
three-judge
court
holding
that
no
substantial
constitutional
question
had
been
raised.
now,
if
that
was
a
correct
determination
then
the
court
can
affirm
the
action
of
the
district
court
on
the
jurisdictional
rule
and
because
it
was
properly
made
by
a
single
judge
as
we
contend.
now
the
district
court’s
determination
that
there
was
no
substantial
question,
constitutional
question
was
made
in
view
of
what
the
court
thought
of
the
manifest
differences
between
alternative
service
and
military
service
and
the
reasonableness
of
providing
this
fringe
benefit
to
veterans
of
military
service
in
the
absence
of
any
cognizable
burden
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion
and
also
the
lack
of
any
establishment
or
religion
in
the
statutory
scheme.
the
substance
of
that
ruling
really
requires
a
consideration
of
the
merits
which
is
presented
in
the
robison
case
and
has
not
been
touched
on
in
the
arguments
here,
so
that
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
defer
that
for
further
discussion
until
that
case,
and
if
i
were
to
begin
it
here,
i
would
be
unfair
to
the
other
side,
although
i
would
not
want
to
give
up
my
time
here
and
not
be
able
to
continue.
so
i
think
i
would
rest
at
this
time
but
defer
the
constitutional
question
to
robison.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes,
i
think
that
is
precisely
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
true,
we
would
say
that
there
is
no
greater
constitutional
question
presented
there
than
here,
and
in
either
case,
the
district
court
could
properly
dismiss
both
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
the
lack
of
a
need
to
convene
a
three-judge
court
because
of
the
insubstantiality
of
the
question
presented.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
district
judge
denied
a
request
for
a
three-judge
court,
but
then
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
because
you
said
there
were
no
substantial
constitutional
questions
presented.
he
may
have
felt
that
he
had
to
do
that
in
order
to
be
authorized
to
as
a
single
judge
grant
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
true,
but
the
court
also
denied
the
request
for
a
three-judge
court.
on
the
ground
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
true,
and
we’re
not
saying
that
he
had
to
convene
a
three-judge
court
to
determine
whether
he
could
dismiss
under
211,
he
may
have
felt
that
it
was
appropriate
to
consider
both
of
those
issues
in
order
to
make
his
dismissal
proper
as
a
single
judge.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
say
that
211
bars
any
review
of
a
decision
of
the
administrator
and
on
211
alone,
the
district
court
properly
dismissed
the
case.
we
don’t
think
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
address
the
three-judge
court
question,
a
motion
was
before
him,
he
may
have
felt
an
appropriate
thing
to
do
to
not
to
leave
it
unresolved
in
order
to
make
it
clear
that
his
action
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
properly
taken
as
a
single
judge.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
believe
that
211
supersedes
whatever
jurisdiction
is
otherwise
available
under
one
of
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes
whether
it
be
1361
the
mandamus
statute
or
1331
the
general
federal
question
statute.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
exactly
there
are
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
there
are
other
remedies
and
restrains
on
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
under
211.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
lost
my
voice
to
a
cold
over
the
weekend.
and
if
i
don’t
come
across
loudly
often
times,
let
me
know,
i’ll
try
to
speak
out.
there
are
two
consolidated
cases
before
the
court
in
hernandez
presenting
the
same
issues
on
the
merits
and
on
jurisdiction
as
would
be
considered
also
in
the
robison
case
next
on
the
calendar.
we
don’t
have
an
extensive
factual
record
below
because
the
case
went
off
in
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
do
not
provide
substantial
background
about
the
plaintiffs
here.
we
do
know
that
they
did,
as
alleged,
serve
two
years
of
alternative
service
and
were
denied
benefits
when
they
applied
to
the
va
for
educational
benefits
provided
by
the
1966
veterans
readjustments
benefits
act.
i
think
i
will
start
by
turning
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
section
211
applies
here.
by
its
terms
it
says
that
a
decision
of
the
administrator
of
the
va
under
any
of
the
laws
administered
by
the
va
with
certain
exceptions
for
contractual
benefits,
not
involved
here,
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
and
no
other
official
or
any
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
or
power
to
review
such
a
decision.
now,
we
think
this
statute
clearly
covers
this
case
by
its
terms.
if
plaintiffs
are
seeking
here
to
review
a
decision
of
the
administrator
namely
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
benefits,
their
effort
to
get
out
of
the
terms
of
the
statute
really
involves
an
assertion
that
there
are
reasons
why
he
should
--
the
administrator
should
have
come
to
a
contrary
decision.
they
say,
he
should
have
decided
that
they
were
entitled
to
benefits
for
reasons
that
he
did
not
consider
namely
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
but
you
cannot
avoid
the
fact
that
these
cases
seek
to
review
a
decision
of
the
administrator
to
the
fact
that
they
were
not
entitled
the
benefits,
and
therefore
the
cases
are
squarely
within
the
terms
of
211.
now
to
appreciate
the
scope
of
preclusion
of
review
that
congress
intended,
i
think
it
is
important
to
trace
the
background
of
the
statute.
a
forerunner
of
211
was
enacted
in
1921
which
provided
that
the
director
of
the
veterans’
bureau,
then
administering
the
veterans’
benefits
laws,
adopted
after
world
war
i,
shall
decide
all
questions
arising
under
the
act.
now
in
the
silver
shine
case
and
a
series
of
decisions
in
the
1920s,
this
court
decided
that
while
any
questions
of
fact
were
not
subject
to
judicial
review
under
that
statute
that
a
question
of
law,
or
the
question
whether
the
administrator’s
decision
was
arbitrary
or
whether
there
was
any
evidence
whatever
to
support
the
decision
might
not
be
subject
to
the
preclusion.
then
in
1933
congress
enacted
the
economy
act.
it’s
part
of
the
effort
to
reduce
government
expenditures,
and
made
various
changes
in
the
veterans’
benefits
program,
and
in
that
statute
there
was
another
preclusion
provision
which
provided
that
all
decisions
of
the
administrator
under
the
provisions
of
law
for
non-contractual
benefits
shall
be
conclusive
on
all
questions
of
law
and
fact
and
no
official
or
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
review
those
decisions
by
mandamus
or
otherwise.
in
lynch
against
united
states
in
the
unanimous
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brandeis,
this
court
observed
that
the
1933
provision
was
obviously
intended
by
congress
to
eliminate
even
the
scope
of
review
that
the
court
have
previously
said
was
available
under
the
1921
act.
and
there
was
no
intimation
that
any
constitutional
program
was
presented
by
that
action.
indeed,
in
lynch,
the
court
discussed
at
some
length
the
enormous
power
that
congress
has
to
grant
or
withdraw
benefits
fortuitous
or
non-contractual
benefits
and
the
enormous
power
that
congress
has
to
grant
or
withdraw
a
forum
in
which
to
press
for
relief
under
a
statute
granting
such
benefits.
in
1957,
the
1933
provision
and
a
similar
provision
adopted
in
1940
were
combined
into
the
immediate
predecessor
of
211.
at
that
statute,
included
the
language
to
the
effect
that
the
administrator’s
decision
on
any
question
of
law
or
fact
concerning
a
claim
for
benefits
under
these
non-contractual
provision
was
conclusive
and
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
a
series
of
decisions
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
construed
211
as
not
precluding
review
of
a
decision
concerning
termination
or
reduction
of
benefits
distinguishing
between
claim
and
termination.
now,
this
led
congress
in
1970
to
amend
the
statute
retroactive
to
1940
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
congress
intended
that
all
decisions
of
the
administrator
under
the
provisions
of
the
statutes
providing
for
non-contractual
benefits
were
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
there
is
not.
there
is
some
indication
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
would
not
say
that
is
this
case
because
the
--
well
before
we
contend
that
the
va
has
decided
the
constitutional
question
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
sorry.
i
couldn’t
hear.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
under
the
statute
that
makes
that
distinction
or
on
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
the
cases
construing
the
present
statute
in
roth
against
united
states
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
an
example,
say
that
211
precludes
review
of
any
decision
even
where
it
is
claimed
that
the
administrator
committed
an
error
of
law
or
if
constitutional
dimension
in
applying
the
statute.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it
was
claimed
in
the
roth
case
that
the
decision
of
the
administrator
was
based
on
either
a
lack
of
evidence
or
in
which
the
claim
was
treated
resulted
in
a
denial
of
due
process
to
the
claimant.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
the
nature
of
that
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
was
the
allegation
and
the
court
said
even
without
allegation
of
the
denial
of
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
there’s
nothing
in
the
terms
of
211
that
makes
any
exception
for
that
situation
and
the
observation
of
the
court
in
the
lynch
case
where
they
said
that
the
similar
statute
eliminated
review
of
an
arbitrary
decision
by
the
administrator
would
lead
in
that
direction.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
think
you
can
enlarge
measure
or
acquaint
that
to
because
of
the
way
that
the
question
of
due
process
has
developed
to
the
often
interchangeable
with
arbitrary
action.
there
is
another
indication
of
the
congress’
intent
in
the
1933
economy
act
and
that
under
a
separate
provision
of
that
statute
involving
a
not
contractual
benefits
but
reduction
of
pay
to
certain
people.
congress
had
another
provision
precluding
judicial
review
but
except
in
cases
where
a
constitutional
issue
was
presented.
so
congress
knew
how
to
make
the
distinction
when
it
wanted
to
and
in
none
of
the
statutes
leading
up
to
211
has
it
as
it
done
so.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
211
(a)
would
not
seem
to
apply
on
its
face
because
it
would
not
be
--
if
the
administrator
have
taken
no
action
whatever
on
this
issue,
it
would
not
seem
that
there
would
be
a
decision
of
the
administrator
under
review.
there
would
be
other
questions
raised
in
such
a
suit
as
to
whether
it
was
premature,
whether
there
have
been
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
and
of
course
sovereign
immunity
or
another
basis
for
jurisdiction
would
be
additional
issue
that
would
have
to
be
confronted.
that
of
course
is
not
this
case.
the
desire
of
congress
to
preclude
judicial
review
in
this
area
seems
amply
justified
by
the
potentially
enormous
burden
that
review
of
va
decisions
would
place
on
the
court
it’s
in
that.
va
takes
about
15
million
adjudicative
actions
annually
and
the
board
of
veterans
appeals
alone
disposes
of
some
30,000
cases,
the
vast
majority
of
these
involve
claims
under
the
various
non-contractual
benefit
programs
that
are
the
subject
of
section
211
(a).
now,
the
plaintiffs
claim
that
if
the
suit
is
barred
that
they
are
denied
their
due
process
rights,
but
the
critical
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
they
never
really
face
up
to
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
protects
against
a
denial
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
and
it’s
this
court’s
decision
in
the
roth
case
indicates
every
person
who
seeks
some
benefit
or
is
disappointed
by
the
action
taken
by
government
concerning
him
does
not
have
the
basis
for
a
claim
under
the
fifth
amendment.
there
must
be
a
property
interest
of
some
sort
created
either
by
statute,
contract,
practice,
or
common
law.
the
plaintiffs
concede
that
under
the
statute
on
its
face,
they
have
no
property
interest
in
these
benefits.
they
try
to
construe
or
contend
that
the
statute
has
to
be
read
as
unconstitutional
if
it
does
not
extend
benefits
to
them,
and
therefore,
by
combining
the
constitution
and
the
statute,
they
have
a
property
interest
but
the
court
indicated
in
roth
that
the
constitution
does
not
create
property
interest.
and
that
approach
does
not
have
any
merit,
we
believe.
in
addition,
there
is
a
problem
that
if
the
claim
is
made
is
that
a
statute
unconstitutionally
distinguishes
between
the
groups
by
giving
something
to
one
and
taking
away
or
not
giving
to
someone
else,
all
the
plaintiffs
can
really
claim
is
that
that
distinction
is
invalid.
it
doesn’t
necessarily
follow
that
they
are
entitled
to
get
what
someone
else
got.
it
maybe
that
the
answer
is
that
the
court
or
the
benefit
should
not
have
been
extended
to
either
group
either
it
was
to
everyone
or
to
none,
so
that
the
constitution
itself,
even
in
conjunction
for
the
statute
does
not
give
them
a
right
to
benefits.
the
plaintiffs
have
contended
that
they
have
a
right
to
a
court
hearing
because
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
which
they
say,
basically
requires
that
a
federal
court
be
available
to
hear
any
and
all
constitutional
questions
that
may
be
raised.
now,
just
in
last
term
in
the
palmore
case,
this
court
rejected
the
proposition
that
congress
was
obliged
under
article
iii
to
vest
in
the
federal
courts
all
of
the
judicial
power
authorized
by
article
iii,
and
it
is
still
the
law
and
has
been
throughout
our
history
that
to
have
jurisdiction
in
a
court,
there
has
to
be
a
statute
extending
that
jurisdiction,
and
congress
has
the
power
to
grant
jurisdiction
and
has
power
to
limit
jurisdiction.
and
as
the
court
said
in
lynch,
the
power
knows
virtually
no
limits.
we
would
--
on
the
question
whether
211
applies
to
state
court
proceeding
if
that
has
not
previously
been
raised
in
this
case
as
this
case
arose
in
a
federal
court,
the
question
of
state
court
jurisdiction
over
a
case
like
this
is
one
that,
i
think,
would
require
additional
consideration.
it
is
certainly
not
the
position
of
the
veterans’
administration
that
all
these
cases
should
be
litigated
in
the
state
courts
and
if
a
case
were
filed
in
the
state
court,
there
would
be
a
question
of
sovereign
immunity
just
as
there
is
a
question
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
federal
courts.
to
determine
whether
there
would
be
state
court
jurisdiction
you
would
have
to
know
the
nature
of
the
proceeding,
the
nature
of
the
state
law,
and
the
relief
sought
and
other
matters
that
i
do
not
think
can
be
decided
in
the
abstract.
but
on
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity,
this
is
a
suit
against
the
veterans’
administration
by
name,
its
administrator
and
the
regional
administrator
concerning
the
actions
of
these
officials
in
the
course
of
their
duties.
the
relief
sought
would
require
the
affirmative
action
of
these
officials
in
turning
over
to
the
plaintiffs’
funds,
property,
money
that
is
unquestionably
belonging
to
the
united
states.
now
we
feel
that
this
brings
--
it
makes
the
case
squarely
one
against
the
united
states
in
substance
even
if
in
form
against
its
officials
and
under
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
in
the
larson
case,
i
assume
you
made
just
a
declaratory
judgment
request?
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
in
the
larson
case,
the
court
indicated
that
even
if
only
declaratory
relief
had
been
sought,
there
would
still
be
a
sovereign
immunity
problem.
indeed,
it
suggested
that
there
might
be
a
greater
one
because
there
would
be
a
--
could
be
a
binding
declaration
of
rights.
it
is
always
been
said
in
these
sovereign
immunity
cases
is
that
the
action
can
precede
against
the
officer
but
it
is
not
binding
against
the
government,
it’s
not
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
would
not
attempt
here
to
try
to
square
those
cases
with
all
of
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
which
the
court
has
recognized
as
not
an
area
of
perfect
logical
symmetry.
but
in
the
cases
where
the
courts
have
entertained
suits
against
officials
where
they
--
where
officials
of
the
united
states,
they
have
tended
to
involve
property
either
land
or
coal
or
something
tangible
which
there
was
a
claim
that
the
property
really
belong
to
the
plaintiff
and
that
this
officer
was
retaining
it
against
the
rights
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
question
of
possession
could
be
determined
as
between
the
two
with
the
question
to
ultimate
title
vis-a-vis
the
united
states
left
to
another
forum.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
if
the
court
will
hold
the
sovereign
immunity
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
wouldn’t
say
the
congress
has
wasted
its
time
because
there
maybe
suits
that
would
be
subject
to
211
that
would
not
necessary
be
subject
to
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
but
in
this
case,
given
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought
and
the
nature
of
the
parties,
we
say
that
it
is
barred
both
by
sovereign
immunity
and
211.
the
court
could,
if
it
so
chose,
resolve
this
case
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
statute
that
is
constitutional
without
necessarily
reaching
the
merits.
this
was
the
approach
taken
in
brooks
against
doe
where
a
difficult
question
was
raised
concerning
a
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court
to
grant
relief
against
the
federal
official
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
the
court
said
that
where
the
plaintiffs’
claim
was
lacking
in
substance,
it
wasn’t
essential
to
reach
that
difficult
jurisdictional
issue,
because
they
could
affirm
on
the
merits.
that
is
the
position
we
would
take
here
and
that
the
court
can
affirm
in
this
case
on
either
ground.
of
course
if
the
court
is
going
to
reject
our
position
in
the
robison
case
on
the
merits,
it’s
essential
that
it
resolve
both
jurisdiction
and
the
question
on
the
merits.
now
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
yes,
that’s
exactly
my
next
point
that
the
alternative
or
the
second
point
decided
by
the
district
court
in
hernandez
was
that
after
holding
that
211
barred
jurisdiction,
the
court
also
denied
the
request
for
a
three-judge
court
holding
that
no
substantial
constitutional
question
had
been
raised.
now,
if
that
was
a
correct
determination
then
the
court
can
affirm
the
action
of
the
district
court
on
the
jurisdictional
rule
and
because
it
was
properly
made
by
a
single
judge
as
we
contend.
now
the
district
court’s
determination
that
there
was
no
substantial
question,
constitutional
question
was
made
in
view
of
what
the
court
thought
of
the
manifest
differences
between
alternative
service
and
military
service
and
the
reasonableness
of
providing
this
fringe
benefit
to
veterans
of
military
service
in
the
absence
of
any
cognizable
burden
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion
and
also
the
lack
of
any
establishment
or
religion
in
the
statutory
scheme.
the
substance
of
that
ruling
really
requires
a
consideration
of
the
merits
which
is
presented
in
the
robison
case
and
has
not
been
touched
on
in
the
arguments
here,
so
that
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
me
to
defer
that
for
further
discussion
until
that
case,
and
if
i
were
to
begin
it
here,
i
would
be
unfair
to
the
other
side,
although
i
would
not
want
to
give
up
my
time
here
and
not
be
able
to
continue.
so
i
think
i
would
rest
at
this
time
but
defer
the
constitutional
question
to
robison.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes,
i
think
that
is
precisely
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
true,
we
would
say
that
there
is
no
greater
constitutional
question
presented
there
than
here,
and
in
either
case,
the
district
court
could
properly
dismiss
both
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
the
lack
of
a
need
to
convene
a
three-judge
court
because
of
the
insubstantiality
of
the
question
presented.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
district
judge
denied
a
request
for
a
three-judge
court,
but
then
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
because
you
said
there
were
no
substantial
constitutional
questions
presented.
he
may
have
felt
that
he
had
to
do
that
in
order
to
be
authorized
to
as
a
single
judge
grant
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
true,
but
the
court
also
denied
the
request
for
a
three-judge
court.
on
the
ground
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
true,
and
we’re
not
saying
that
he
had
to
convene
a
three-judge
court
to
determine
whether
he
could
dismiss
under
211,
he
may
have
felt
that
it
was
appropriate
to
consider
both
of
those
issues
in
order
to
make
his
dismissal
proper
as
a
single
judge.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
say
that
211
bars
any
review
of
a
decision
of
the
administrator
and
on
211
alone,
the
district
court
properly
dismissed
the
case.
we
don’t
think
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
address
the
three-judge
court
question,
a
motion
was
before
him,
he
may
have
felt
an
appropriate
thing
to
do
to
not
to
leave
it
unresolved
in
order
to
make
it
clear
that
his
action
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
properly
taken
as
a
single
judge.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
believe
that
211
supersedes
whatever
jurisdiction
is
otherwise
available
under
one
of
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes
whether
it
be
1361
the
mandamus
statute
or
1331
the
general
federal
question
statute.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
exactly
there
are
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
there
are
other
remedies
and
restrains
on
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
under
211.
