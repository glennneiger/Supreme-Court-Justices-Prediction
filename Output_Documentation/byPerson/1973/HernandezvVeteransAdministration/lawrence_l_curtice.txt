mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
a
jurisdictional
one,
namely,
whether
38
u.s.c.
section
211
(a)
bars
judicial
review
of
a
lawsuit
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
concerning
veterans’
educational
benefits.
in
the
companion
case
of
robison
versus
johnson,
the
merits
of
the
claim
will
be
discussed.
the
issue
here
is
only
whether
38
u.s.c.
211
(a)
bars
judicial
review.
during
my
15
minutes,
i
will
discuss
the
question
of
the
proper
statutory
construction
of
211
(a)
and
the
due
process
limitations,
which
we
feel
are
inherent
in
a
contrary
construction
of
211
(a).
my
colleague,
mr.
petranker
will
discuss
the
question
of
whether
congress
has
a
power
to
sole
limit
judicial
review
and
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
sovereign
immunity
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit.
the
facts
are
simple
and
undisputed.
petitioners
here
and
our
conscientious
objectors
who
have
performed
two
years
of
alternative
services
as
required
under
section
456
of
50
u.s.c.
thereafter,
they
applied
for
veterans’
educational
benefits
with
the
veterans’
administration.
their
claim
for
benefits
was
denied
under
the
statute
since
they
did
not
fall
within
the
definition
of
those
individuals
who
have
served
more
than
180
days
in
active
duty.
thereafter,
petitioners
filed
a
lawsuit
in
federal
district
court
in
california
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
veterans’
readjustment
benefits
act
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
in
validation
of
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well,
there
were
two
main
jurisdictional
bases,
the
mandamus
38
u.s.c.
section
1651
and
excuse
me
--
and
the
$10,000
requirement
under
1331,
28
u.s.c.
1361
and
1331.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes,
in
both
cases.
the
district
court
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
the
relief
requested
was
declaratory
relief,
injunctive
relief,
and
affirmative
relief,
namely,
that
they
received
the
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
the
complaint
appears
as
appendix
--
it’s
in
the
record
but
i
am
not
exactly
sure
where
it
is.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
no,
i
do
not.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
lawsuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
grounds
that
38
u.s.c.
section
211
(a)
is
a
bar
to
our
claim
that
petitioners
are
entitled
to
veterans’
educational
benefits.
the
first
issue
that
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
is
the
proper
statutory
construction
of
211
(a).
we
submit
that
under
a
proper
interpretation
of
211
(a),
the
more
difficult
constitutional
questions
involved
in
a
contrary
construction
of
211
(a)
need
not
be
faced.
we
submit
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
that
this
case
should
not
be
barred
by
211
(a).
the
statute
provides
that
the
decisions
of
the
administrator,
on
any
question
of
law
or
fact,
under
any
law
administered
by
the
veterans’
administration,
shall
be
final
and
the
courts
shall
have
no
power
to
review
any
such
decision.
by
the
terms
of
the
language
of
that
statute,
this
lawsuit
is
not
barred
for
we
are
not
seeking
review
of
a
decision
of
the
veterans’
administration.
the
veterans’
administration
has
refused
to
consider
petitioner’s
constitutional
claims,
and
we
contend
rightfully
so
that
they
don’t
have
the
power
to
consider
our
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
which
they
administer.
furthermore,
under
the
language
of
the
statute,
we
are
not
seeking
review
of
any
question
of
the
law
administered
by
the
veterans’
administration.
we
are
instead
contending
that
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional.
so
we’re
not
seeking
review
on
any
question
of
law
by
the
veterans’
administration.
the
statutory
history
of
section
211
(a)
and
particularly
the
1970
amendment
support
our
conclusion.
the
government
suggest
that
211
(a),
the
1970
amendment
of
211
(a)
was
meant
to
cut
out
judicial
review
even
in
this
type
of
case
where
we’re
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress.
it’s
apparent
from
the
legislative
history
that
the
purpose
of
the
1970
amendment
was
merely
to
overrule
certain
decisions
of
the
district
--
the
circuit
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
concerning
questions
involving
the
termination
of
benefits,
the
dc
circuit
had
held
that
211
(a)
was
not
a
bar
to
cases
involving
determination
of
benefits
in
contrast
to
those
cases
involving
the
application
for
benefits,
and
we
submit
that
the
1970
amendment
was
only
meant
to
overrule
this
type
of
case.
there
is
nothing
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1970
amendment
or
the
earlier
enactments
of
the
predecessors
of
211
(a)
that
indicate
that
congress
wish
to
cutoff
judicial
review
in
this
type
of
case,
namely,
where
we’re
seeking
judicial
review
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
and
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
the
veterans’
readjustment
benefits
act.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
which
says,
that
veterans
who
served
more
than
180
days
on
active
duty
are
entitled
to
veterans’
educational
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes?
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well,
i
would
like
to
defer
that
to
the
robison
case.
we’re
going
to
strictly
limit
ourselves
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well,
previous
cases
have
held
that
it
would
not
permit
such
a
review
and
we
do
not
have
that
question
before
us
at
this
time.
ours
is
a
much
narrower
issue
where
there
has
been
absolutely
no
review
by
any
court
or
no
decision
by
the
administrator
at
all
on
the
questions
presented.
ours
is
a
case
in
which
the
administrator
has
refused
to
consider
the
constitutional
challenges
to
the
statute.
we’re
not
seeking
review
of
a
factual
legal
question
which
the
veterans’
administration
has
already
resolved.
this
construction
of
the
statute
would
also
be
in
line
with
this
court’s
theory
that
judicial
review
of
statutes
should
not
be
cutoff
unless
it’s
within
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
supports
that
interpretation,
and
we
submit
there
isn’t
such
here.
also,
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
would
save
this
court
the
necessity
of
facing
the
constitutional
issues
involved
in
the
case
which
we
submit
are
gray.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
into
the
due
process
limitations
which
are
inherent
in
the
contrary
construction.
if
211
(a)
were
construed
not
to
apply
to
case
like
this,
we
submit
that
petitioners’
due
process
rights
have
been
violated.
namely,
they
have
been
denied
an
opportunity
for
a
meaningful
hearing
appropriate
to
the
nature
of
their
claim.
they
have
had
absolutely
no
hearing
whatsoever
on
their
constitutional
claim
which
is
the
one
that’s
appropriate
to
the
nature
of
their
claim
in
this
case.
and
we
submit
that
the
protections
of
the
due
process
clause
come
within
in
the
meaning
of
the
board
of
regents
v.
roth,
because
there
has
been
a
legitimate
--
petitioners
do
have
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well
--
i
am
not,
no
not
the
reasonable
expectation
because
under
the
statute,
it’s
clear
that
they
didn’t
have
a
reasonable
expectation.
but
we
submit
that
the
statute
provides
the
basis
for
the
claim
and
the
constitution
provides
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
the
benefits.
for
example,
if
the
statute
had
said
that
no
blacks
were
to
receive
benefits
under
the
statute,
we
submit
that
roth
would
cover
the
situation
even
though
that
it’s
quite
clear
that
they
have
no
reasonable
expectation
of
receiving
it.
in
other
words,
the
constitution
provides
a
source
of
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
these
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
i
think
that
the
roth
decision
should
be
extended
to
the
extent
that
covers
claims
for
property
interest
which
but
for
the
constitutional,
--
beyond
constitutional
statute,
they
would
be
entitled
to
receive
those
benefits.
i
would
say
that
if
again,
if
the
statute
have
provided
that
no
--
all
veterans
are
entitled
to
receive
benefits
except
for
black
veterans
they
would
have
a
right
--
a
due
process
right,
a
property
right
that
they
should
have
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
present
their
claim
of
entitlement
to
these
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
no,
in
this
type
of
case,
the
only
place
where
there’d
be
such
a
right
when
you’re
challenging
the
constitutionality
would
be
in
federal
courts.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
we
still
have
standing
to
sue
because
we’re
seeking
the
benefits
in
question.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well
that
would
get
into
the
question
of
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
i
would
submit
that
that
is
distinguishable.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
in
our
case,
we
have
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement.
that’s
our
contention
and
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well,
i
would
say
then
that
it
would
come
within
that.
but
it’s
a
case
that
would
be
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
no,
not
the
constitution.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
i’m
relying
upon
roth
but
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
i’m
relying
upon
the
statute
itself.
i’m
relying
upon
the
veterans’
readjustment
benefits
act.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
then
under
the
writ
of
mandamus
statute,
we’re
submitting
that
we
are
entitled
to
make
the
claim
for
benefits
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well,
we
submit
in
the
case,
for
example,
where
again
the
example
of
the
statute,
which
says
that
no
black
was
to
receive
benefits
that
that
would
come
under
the
roth
rational.
in
other
words,
you’d
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
challenge
the
statute
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
they
have
said
that
but
we
submit
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
i
will
yield
to
mr.
petranker.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
there
are
two
cases
that
were
consolidated.
i
brought
one
action
and
mr.
petranker
brought
another
and
they
were
consolidated
for
purposes
of
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
that’s
right.
we’re
saying
--
we’re
also
saying
that
the
statute
as
construed
does
not
apply
to
a
case
like
this,
211
(a);
on
its
face,
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes,
it
would.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
that’s
right.
it
does
not
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
right
and
mr.
petranker
will
go
into
other
constitutional
problems.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
a
jurisdictional
one,
namely,
whether
38
u.s.c.
section
211
(a)

--
and

mr.

no,
i
do

the
district
court
dismissed
the
lawsuit
and
the
ninth

affirmed
on
the

that

u.s.c.
section
211
(a)
is
a

to
our
claim
that

are
entitled

the
first
issue
that
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
is
the
proper
statutory
construction
of
211
(a).
we
submit
that
under
a
proper
interpretation
of
211
(a),
the
more
difficult
constitutional
questions
involved
in
a
contrary
construction
of
211
(a)
need
not
be

we
submit
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
that
this
case
should
not
be

by

the
statute

by

this
lawsuit
is
not

for
we
are
not

of

the
veterans’
administration
has
refused
to
consider
petitioner’s
constitutional
claims,
and
we
contend
rightfully
so
that
they
don’t
have
the
power
to
consider
our

so
we’re
not
seeking
review
on
any
question
of
law
by
the
veterans’
administration.
the
statutory
history
of
section
211
(a)
and
particularly
the
1970
amendment
support
our
conclusion.
the
government
suggest

to
overrule
this
type
of
case.
there
is
nothing
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1970
amendment
or
the
earlier
enactments
of
the
predecessors
of
211
(a)
that
indicate
that
congress
wish
to
cutoff
judicial
review
in
this
type
of
case,
namely,
where
we’re
seeking
judicial
review
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
and
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
the
veterans’
readjustment
benefits
act.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
which
says,
that
veterans
who
served
more
than
180
days
on
active
duty
are
entitled
to
veterans’
educational
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes?
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well,
i
would
like
to
defer
that
to
the
robison
case.
we’re
going
to
strictly
limit
ourselves
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well,
previous
cases
have
held
that
it
would
not
permit
such
a
review
and
we
do
not
have
that
question
before
us
at
this
time.
ours
is
a
much
narrower
issue
where
there
has
been
absolutely
no
review
by
any
court
or
no
decision
by
the
administrator
at
all
on
the
questions
presented.
ours
is
a
case
in
which
the
administrator
has
refused
to
consider
the
constitutional
challenges
to
the
statute.
we’re
not
seeking
review
of
a
factual
legal
question
which
the
veterans’
administration
has
already
resolved.
this
construction
of
the
statute
would
also
be
in
line
with
this
court’s
theory
that
judicial
review
of
statutes
should
not
be
cutoff
unless
it’s
within
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
supports
that
interpretation,
and
we
submit
there
isn’t
such
here.
also,
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
would
save
this
court
the
necessity
of
facing
the
constitutional
issues
involved
in
the
case
which
we
submit
are
gray.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
into
the
due
process
limitations
which
are
inherent
in
the
contrary
construction.
if
211
(a)
were
construed
not
to
apply
to
case
like
this,
we
submit
that
petitioners’
due
process
rights
have
been
violated.
namely,
they
have
been
denied
an
opportunity
for
a
meaningful
hearing
appropriate
to
the
nature
of
their
claim.
they
have
had
absolutely
no
hearing
whatsoever
on
their
constitutional
claim
which
is
the
one
that’s
appropriate
to
the
nature
of
their
claim
in
this
case.
and
we
submit
that
the
protections
of
the
due
process
clause
come
within
in
the
meaning
of
the
board
of
regents
v.
roth,
because
there
has
been
a
legitimate
--
petitioners
do
have
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well
--
i
am
not,
no
not
the
reasonable
expectation
because
under
the
statute,
it’s
clear
that
they
didn’t
have
a
reasonable
expectation.
but
we
submit
that
the
statute
provides
the
basis
for
the
claim
and
the
constitution
provides
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
the
benefits.
for
example,
if
the
statute
had
said
that
no
blacks
were
to
receive
benefits
under
the
statute,
we
submit
that
roth
would
cover
the
situation
even
though
that
it’s
quite
clear
that
they
have
no
reasonable
expectation
of
receiving
it.
in
other
words,
the
constitution
provides
a
source
of
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
these
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
i
think
that
the
roth
decision
should
be
extended
to
the
extent
that
covers
claims
for
property
interest
which
but
for
the
constitutional,
--
beyond
constitutional
statute,
they
would
be
entitled
to
receive
those
benefits.
i
would
say
that
if
again,
if
the
statute
have
provided
that
no
--
all
veterans
are
entitled
to
receive
benefits
except
for
black
veterans
they
would
have
a
right
--
a
due
process
right,
a
property
right
that
they
should
have
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
present
their
claim
of
entitlement
to
these
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
no,
in
this
type
of
case,
the
only
place
where
there’d
be
such
a
right
when
you’re
challenging
the
constitutionality
would
be
in
federal
courts.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
we
still
have
standing
to
sue
because
we’re
seeking
the
benefits
in
question.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well
that
would
get
into
the
question
of
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
i
would
submit
that
that
is
distinguishable.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
in
our
case,
we
have
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement.
that’s
our
contention
and
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well,
i
would
say
then
that
it
would
come
within
that.
but
it’s
a
case
that
would
be
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
no,
not
the
constitution.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
i’m
relying
upon
roth
but
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
i’m
relying
upon
the
statute
itself.
i’m
relying
upon
the
veterans’
readjustment
benefits
act.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
then
under
the
writ
of
mandamus
statute,
we’re
submitting
that
we
are
entitled
to
make
the
claim
for
benefits
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
well,
we
submit
in
the
case,
for
example,
where
again
the
example
of
the
statute,
which
says
that
no
black
was
to
receive
benefits
that
that
would
come
under
the
roth
rational.
in
other
words,
you’d
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
challenge
the
statute
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
they
have
said
that
but
we
submit
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
i
will
yield
to
mr.
petranker.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
there
are
two
cases
that
were
consolidated.
i
brought
one
action
and
mr.
petranker
brought
another
and
they
were
consolidated
for
purposes
of
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
that’s
right.
we’re
saying
--
we’re
also
saying
that
the
statute
as
construed
does
not
apply
to
a
case
like
this,
211
(a);
on
its
face,
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes,
it
would.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
yes.
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
that’s
right.
it
does
not
--
mr.
lawrence
l.
curtice
right
and
mr.
petranker
will
go
into
other
constitutional
problems.
