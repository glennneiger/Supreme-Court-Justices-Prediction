the
veteran's
readjustment
act
of
1966
provides
educational
assistance
benefits
for
draftees
inducted
into
the
armed
forces
and
also
for
conscientious
objectors
also
inducted
into
the
armed
forces
who
serve
with
the
troupes
on
non-combatant
duty.
the
act
does
not,
however,
provide
educational
assistance
benefits
for
draftees
classified
10,
that
is
conscientious
objectors
who
perform
required
alternative
civilian
service,
for
example,
the
two
year
service
perform
by
appellee
in
johnson
v.
robison
at
the
peter
bent
brigham
hospital
in
boston.
because
appellee
was
an
alternative
civilian
service
performer,
the
veteran's
administration
denied
his
application
for
educational
assistance
benefits.
appellee
there
upon
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
veterans
readjustment
act
in
this
action
brought
in
the
district
court
for
massachusetts,
alleging
that
the
provisions
as
applied
to
deny
him
benefits,
violated
his
first
amendment
guarantees
of
religious
freedom
and
his
fifth
amendment
guarantee
of
equal
protection
laws.
the
veteran's
administration
sought
dismissal
of
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
because
38
u.s.c.
section
211
(a)
prohibits
judicial
review
of
decisions
of
the
administration.
the
district
court
held
that
211
(a)
was
inapplicable
to
suit,
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
provisions
of
the
act
and
denied
that
motion.
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
held
that
appellee's
first
amendment
claim
was
without
merit,
but
sustained
appellee's
equal
protection
claim
and
entered
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
challenged
sections
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
we
agree
that
section
211
(a),
did
not
bar
appellee's
suit
and
also
agree
that
appellee's
first
amendment
claim
is
without
merit.
we
disagree,
however,
that
the
contested
sections
deny
appellee
equal
protect
laws
and
therefore
reverse
of
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.

case

out
alternative
civilian
service
on
the
ground
that
28

the
