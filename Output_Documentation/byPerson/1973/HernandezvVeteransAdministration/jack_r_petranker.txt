mr.
jack
r.
petranker
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
stewart
raised.
i
think
that
mr.
curtice
correctly
answered
that
question
but
i
sense
that
there
may
be
some
confusion
left
in
the
minds
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
the
question
whether
an
individual
could
come
into
court
and
claim
a
right
to
a
hearing
on
his
claim
that
he
was
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
aid
to
dependent
children’s
act,
even
though
he
was
not
a
mother
and
does
not
have
dependent
children.
i
think
the
distinction
between
that
case
and
this
one
is
that
there
would
be
an
independent
basis
there
for
denying
jurisdiction
and
that
is
simply
that
his
claim
would
be
frivolous,
whether
or
not
it
was
brought
in
good
faith.
i
think
that
once
the
terms
of
the
statute
were
taken
into
account
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
that
there
simply
would
be
no
valid
constitutional
claim.
in
this
case,
our
position
is
that
once
the
statute
is
properly
considered
in
light
of
its
purposes,
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
that
conscientious
objectors
who
perform
alternative
service
like
persons
who
are
in
the
armed
forces
are
entitled
to
those
benefits.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
that’s
correct
your
honor.
we
think
that’s
fundamental.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
yes,
1331.
also,
section
1361
and
in
addition
in
my
complaint
we
raised
an
additional
jurisdictional
ground
5
u.s.c.
section
701
and
the
following
sections,
which
will
make
the
--
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
no,
the
administrative
procedure
act,
your
honor,
which
specifies
that
a
person
aggrieved
by
agency
action
has
the
right
to
go
into
federal
court
to
seek
relief.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
yes.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
that’s
correct.
our
contention
is
that
since
section
211
(a)
doesn’t
apply
here,
the
administrative
procedure
act
does.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
essentially,
the
value
of
an
education
to
the
individual
plaintiffs
involved,
the
benefits
that
they
are
seeking
would
enable
them
to
obtain
a
college
education
or
higher
education,
and
without
those
benefits,
they
might
very
well
not
be
able
to
commence
or
complete
a
college
education
and
over
the
course
of
their
lifetimes
that
certainly
would
result
in
an
economic
deprivation
to
them
in
excess
of
$10,000.
that
was
the
basis
of
our
allegation.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
mr.
hernandez
and
thomas
wolf
were
the
two
named
plaintiffs,
and
in
addition,
it
was
a
class
action,
yes.
mr.
curtice
had
already
addressed
himself
to
the
due
process
issues
involved
in
this
case.
in
addition,
i’d
simply
like
to
point
out
as
the
court
already
has
i
believe
what
the
other
constitutional
problems
are
in
the
government’s
position
that
even
though
petitioners
have
raised
purely
a
constitutional
claim,
a
substantive
constitutional
claim,
that
nonetheless,
they
can
be
denied
relief
or
review
of
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
in
the
federal
courts,
or
for
that
matter
in
any
court.
essentially,
that
proposition,
of
course,
runs
afoul
of
the
rule
recognized
in
countless
decisions
of
this
court
as
fundamental
to
this
form
of
government
and
that
is
that
the
courts
must
always
be
open
to
hear
claims
that
the
constitution
has
been
violated
by
congress.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
if
there
were
no
other
forum,
judicial
forum,
in
which
that
claim
could
be
heard,
then
i
think
essentially
the
same
problem
would
be
raised
here,
yes.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
no,
your
honor.
but
under
the
terms
of
section
211
--
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
but
under
the
terms
of
section
211
(a),
congress
has
apparently
sought
the
cutoff
review
in
every
court,
your
honor.
the
statute
provides
that
the
decisions
of
the
administrator
shall
be
final
and
that
would
appear
to
cover
state
courts
as
well.
and
in
addition,
--
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
well,
that
term
is
ambiguous.
our
position
is
that
there’s
really
no
basis
for
congress
to
decide
that
the
federal
courts
cannot
review
decisions
by
the
veterans’
administration
but
state
courts
can.
that
would
run
contrary
to
the
normal
presumption
that
review
of
federal
agencies
should
be
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
there
might
be
a
problem
there,
your
honor,
and
that
the
removal
statute
would
seem
to
conflict
with
what
the
government
says
section
211
(a)
is
since
they
contend.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
that’s
correct
your
honor.
so
that
there
might
be
a
problem
there
and
that’s
another
reason
that
it
wouldn’t
seem
to
make
sense
to
construe
section
211
(a)
to
allow
suit
in
the
state
courts.
there’d
be
still
a
further
problem
in
that
the
ultimate
reviewer
of
state
court
decisions,
the
supreme
court,
this
court
would
seem
to
be
barred
from
consideration
of
claims
coming
from
the
state
courts
under
that
interpretation.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
if
the
state
courts
were
left
open,
i
don’t
think
there’d
be
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
then
i
don’t
think
--
i
suppose
i
misspoke
myself
to
some
extent.
i
think
there
would
be
a
constitutional
issue
raised.
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
as
difficult
as
the
issue
posed
here,
and
i
think
it
would
certainly
go
much
further
towards
protecting
the
rights
of
petitioners
here
since
they
would
at
least
concede.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
yes.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
on
the
assumption
that,
that
exclusion
was
intended
to
apply
in
federal
courts
but
not
in
state
courts?
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
well,
the
term,
courts
of
the
united
states
has
been
construed
in
other
statutes
to
include
courts
of
the
states,
so
that
that
in
itself,
i
don’t
think
is
a
sufficient
indicator.
but
if
that
construction
were
possible,
i
think
we
would
take
the
position
that
unless
at
the
same
time
appeared
that
there
was
a
definite
right
to
go
into
state
court,
that
the
constitutional
requirements
of
a
hearing
on
the
questions
of
constitutionality
would
not
have
been
satisfied.
there
will
also
be
an
additional
problem
under
article
iii
which
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
those
questions
could
be
entrusted
completely
to
the
state
courts
without
the
possibility
of
review
in
this
court.
but
as
i
say,
that’s
a
much
more
narrow
question
and
it’s
one
that
would
not
pose
as
serious
constitutional
problems
as
are
involved
here.
now,
the
government
has
relied
on
two
basic
arguments
for
their
view
that
the
courts
can
indeed
be
deprived
of
jurisdiction
to
hear
constitutional
claims.
first,
they
point
to
the
fact
that
congress
can,
of
course,
control
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
and
i
suppose,
at
least
within
limits
the
state
courts
as
well.
but
they
failed
the
point
to
any
case
which
is
held
that
congress
can
remove
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
consider
constitutional
claims
where
the
result
would
be
that
no
court
could
consider
a
constitutional
claim.
and
that’s
what’s
involved
here
and
that
is
the
rule
that
we
believe
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
fact
the
entire
theory
of
this
government
requires
that
some
court
must
be
able
to
hear
constitutional
claim.
in
addition,
the
government
relies
on
an
application
of
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
they
contend
that
since
in
the
normal
case,
congress
must
give
its
consent
before
the
united
states
can
be
sued.
but
then
in
this
case,
since
congress
appears
to
under
the
government’s
construction
have
withdrawn
its
consent
to
be
sued
that
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
does
bar
consideration
of
petitioners’
claims.
but,
of
course,
again,
there
is
a
clear
exception
in
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
when
it
is
alleged
that
an
officer
of
the
united
states
is
acting
pursuant
to
an
unconstitutional
statute,
and
that
is
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
so
that
again,
the
position
that
the
government
has
taken
is
unsupported
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
by
the
--
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
well,
in
asking
for
declaratory
judgment,
the
court
does
not
impose
an
affirmative
duty
on
congress
or
an
officer
of
the
united
states
and
it
does
give
congress
the
option
in
this
particular
act,
for
example,
if
the
court
declared
that
the
veterans’
readjustment
benefits
act
was
unconstitutional,
congress
would
have
the
option
of
enacting
a
new
law
terminating
the
law
or
proceeding
to
include
conscientious
objectors
within
the
terms
of
the
act,
so
that
there
is
not
as
direct
an
interference.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
i
think
there
is
that
difference
to
which
i
just
tried
to
address
myself.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
if
that
were
the
only
kind
of
relief
that
could
satisfy
the
claims
of
petitioner
--
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
well,
i
believe
that
the
second
paragraph
of
the
prayer
for
relief
does
also
request
declaratory
relief.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
but
focusing
on
the
first,
there
was
a
suggestion
in
larson
versus
domestic
&
foreign
finance
corporation
that
even
in
the
case
involving
an
allegation
of
unconstitutionality
where
affirmative
relief
would
be
required
in
order
to
effectuate
an
order
of
the
court,
that
sovereign
immunity
might
operate
as
a
bar.
i
think
the
correct
interpretation
of
that
suggestion
is
that
in
a
case
where
affirmative
relief
would
cause
a
substantial
interference
with
the
function
of
the
government.
in
other
words,
a
variant
of
the
compelling
interest
test,
if
you
will.
if
the
government
could
come
in
and
show
with
compelling
interest
which
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it
should
not
be
required
to
enter
a
--
or
to
make
affirmative
relief,
then
it
might
be
that
despite
the
allegation
of
unconstitutionality,
the
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
because
of
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
but
in
the
case
where
affirmative
relief
could
be
granted
without
any
substantial
interference
and
that
was
the
question
--
that
is
a
question,
i
submit,
before
the
court,
then
the
government
would
not
or
the
court
rather
would
not
be
barred
by
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
stewart
raised.
i
think
that
mr.
curtice
correctly
answered
that
question
but
i
sense
that
there
may
be
some
confusion
left
in

of

yes,

in

raised

there
would
be
a
constitutional
issue
raised.
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
as
difficult
as
the
issue
posed
here,
and
i
think
it
would
certainly
go
much
further
towards
protecting
the
rights
of
petitioners
here
since
they
would
at
least
concede.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
yes.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
on
the
assumption
that,
that
exclusion
was
intended
to
apply
in
federal
courts
but
not
in
state
courts?
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
well,
the
term,
courts
of
the
united
states
has
been
construed
in
other
statutes
to
include
courts
of
the
states,
so
that
that
in
itself,
i
don’t
think
is
a
sufficient
indicator.
but
if
that
construction
were
possible,
i
think
we
would
take
the
position
that
unless
at
the
same
time
appeared
that
there
was
a
definite
right
to
go
into
state
court,
that
the
constitutional
requirements
of
a
hearing
on
the
questions
of
constitutionality
would
not
have
been
satisfied.
there
will
also
be
an
additional
problem
under
article
iii
which
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
those
questions
could
be
entrusted
completely
to
the
state
courts
without
the
possibility
of
review
in
this
court.
but
as
i
say,
that’s
a
much
more
narrow
question
and
it’s
one
that
would
not
pose
as
serious
constitutional
problems
as
are
involved
here.
now,
the
government
has
relied
on
two
basic
arguments
for
their
view
that
the
courts
can
indeed
be
deprived
of
jurisdiction
to
hear
constitutional
claims.
first,
they
point
to
the
fact
that
congress
can,
of
course,
control
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
and
i
suppose,
at
least
within
limits
the
state
courts
as
well.
but
they
failed
the
point
to
any
case
which
is
held
that
congress
can
remove
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
to
consider
constitutional
claims
where
the
result
would
be
that
no
court
could
consider
a
constitutional
claim.
and
that’s
what’s
involved
here
and
that
is
the
rule
that
we
believe
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
fact
the
entire
theory
of
this
government
requires
that
some
court
must
be
able
to
hear
constitutional
claim.
in
addition,
the
government
relies
on
an
application
of
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
they
contend
that
since
in
the
normal
case,
congress
must
give
its
consent
before
the
united
states
can
be
sued.
but
then
in
this
case,
since
congress
appears
to
under
the
government’s
construction
have
withdrawn
its
consent
to
be
sued
that
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
does
bar
consideration
of
petitioners’
claims.
but,
of
course,
again,
there
is
a
clear
exception
in
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
when
it
is
alleged
that
an
officer
of
the
united
states
is
acting
pursuant
to
an
unconstitutional
statute,
and
that
is
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
so
that
again,
the
position
that
the
government
has
taken
is
unsupported
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
by
the
--
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
well,
in
asking
for
declaratory
judgment,
the
court
does
not
impose
an
affirmative
duty
on
congress
or
an
officer
of
the
united
states
and
it
does
give
congress
the
option
in
this
particular
act,
for
example,
if
the
court
declared
that
the
veterans’
readjustment
benefits
act
was
unconstitutional,
congress
would
have
the
option
of
enacting
a
new
law
terminating
the
law
or
proceeding
to
include
conscientious
objectors
within
the
terms
of
the
act,
so
that
there
is
not
as
direct
an
interference.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
i
think
there
is
that
difference
to
which
i
just
tried
to
address
myself.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
if
that
were
the
only
kind
of
relief
that
could
satisfy
the
claims
of
petitioner
--
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
well,
i
believe
that
the
second
paragraph
of
the
prayer
for
relief
does
also
request
declaratory
relief.
mr.
jack
r.
petranker
but
focusing
on
the
first,
there
was
a
suggestion
in
larson
versus
domestic
&
foreign
finance
corporation
that
even
in
the
case
involving
an
allegation
of
unconstitutionality
where
affirmative
relief
would
be
required
in
order
to
effectuate
an
order
of
the
court,
that
sovereign
immunity
might
operate
as
a
bar.
i
think
the
correct
interpretation
of
that
suggestion
is
that
in
a
case
where
affirmative
relief
would
cause
a
substantial
interference
with
the
function
of
the
government.
in
other
words,
a
variant
of
the
compelling
interest
test,
if
you
will.
if
the
government
could
come
in
and
show
with
compelling
interest
which
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it
should
not
be
required
to
enter
a
--
or
to
make
affirmative
relief,
then
it
might
be
that
despite
the
allegation
of
unconstitutionality,
the
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
because
of
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
but
in
the
case
where
affirmative
relief
could
be
granted
without
any
substantial
interference
and
that
was
the
question
--
that
is
a
question,
i
submit,
before
the
court,
then
the
government
would
not
or
the
court
rather
would
not
be
barred
by
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
