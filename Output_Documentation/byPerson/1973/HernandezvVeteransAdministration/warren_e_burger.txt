chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
hernandez
against
veterans’
administration,
72-700.
mr.
curtice,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
they
had
a
reasonable
expectation?
is
that
the
point
you’re
drawing
on
the
roth
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
counsel,
that
a
young
man
had
been
in
the
peace
corps
and
he
made
the
same
claim
for
educational
benefits
that
your
client
is
making
here,
and
the
veterans’
administration
presumably
would
deny
that
claim
administratively,
wouldn’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
he’s
not
a
veteran.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
isn’t
the
veterans’
administration
administratively
saying
that
they
have
denied
this
claim
for
substantially
the
same
reason,
that
he
is
not
a
veteran?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
in
that
sense,
procedurally,
and
set
aside
the
substantive
claim,
procedurally,
he
is
in
the
same
posture
as
a
peace
corps
--
a
former
peace
corps
man
who
wanted
veterans’
benefit,
isn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fine.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
the
same
claim
again
going
back
to
the
peace
corps
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
peace
corps,
former
peace
corps
man
said
this
is
denial
of
equal
protection
or
otherwise
raise
a
constitutional
question.
you
say,
he
has
a
right
to
have
a
federal
court
decide
that
constitutional
question
narrowly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
petranker,
we
have
detained
your
colleague
a
little
longer
and
we
will
enlarge
your
time
by
three
minutes
to
compensate
for
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
any
time
you
allege
a
constitutional
claim,
the
court
--
the
federal
court
must
hear
it
unless
it’s
determined
that’s
insubstantial.
the
court
might
decide
that
it’s
an
insubstantial
frivolous
claim,
not
this
particular
one,
but
a
claim
and
then
not
here
but
otherwise
if
the
constitutional
issue
is
raised,
you
say
it,
must
be
heard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
petranker.
mr.
norton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
agree
with
mr.
curtice’s
response
to
the
hypothetical
question
i
gave
about
the
peace
corps
veteran
who
came
in
and
made
the
same
claim
that’s
being
made
here.
do
you
agree
that
the
district
court
could
say
that
claim
is
so
insubstantial
for
constitutional
claim
and
that
i
will
not
convene
a
three-judge
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
and
you
think
that’s
true
here
too,
but
that’s
because
you
think
both
cases
attend
to
equate
to
each
other
that
is
the
peace
corps
veteran
and
the
petitioners
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
conceivably
to
--
excuse
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
marshall
put
a
question
to
you
or
perhaps
to
one
of
your
friends
awhile
ago,
saying
that
if
the
veterans’
administration
can
find
educational
benefits
to
those
veterans
who
had
served
overseas
that
that
might
conceivably
raise
a
constitutional
question
and
the
three-judge
court
or
a
single
district
judge
might
conceivably,
i
take
it,
decided
to
call
or
convene
a
three-judge
court
for
that
purpose,
you
would
not
agree
with
it
perhaps?
but
i
am
trying
to
distinguish
that
kind
of
the
case,
raising
what
would
appear
to
be
a
significant
constitutional
question
from
the
one
which
you
considered
insubstantial
here.
in
short,
you
wouldn’t
say
it
was
an
insubstantial
claim
if
the
veterans’
administration
was
denying
benefits
to
all
veterans
except
those
who
went
overseas
when
the
statute
obviously
gives
no
such
authority.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let’s
take
an
extreme
case
then,
that
the
veterans’
administration
administrator
decides
that
because
of
the
shortage
of
funds,
rate
inflation,
and
a
lot
of
factors,
he
is
not
going
to
pay
any
education
benefits
to
anyone.
he
is
just
going
to
nullify
that
section
of
the
act
of
congress,
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
open
to
mandamus
under
211?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
might
also
answer
that
the
same
for
the
veterans’
administration
did
that,
he
would
be
fired
by
the
president
throughout
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
a
follow
up
to
congress
and
the
problem
would
solve
itself
politically.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you’re
saying
that
there
is
only
a
political
remedy
on
that
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
disposition
in
72-1297
and
72-700,
johnson
against
robison
and
hernandez
against
veterans
administration
will
be
announced
