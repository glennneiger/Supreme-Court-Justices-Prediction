justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
do
you
think
that’s
true
if
the
claim
was
less
than
$10,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn’t
say
that
it
will
have
to
be
raisable
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
got
here
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wouldn’t
be
removal
if
federal
court
didn’t
have
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
211
said
that
the
united
states
courts
shall
not
have
jurisdiction
of
any
action
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
any
provision
of
this
statute
that
you
would
be
arguing
that
statute
is
unconstitutional;
that
provision
is
unconstitutional
itself,
barring
--
barring
those
sort
of
suits
in
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
let’s
assume
that
this
present
section
is
construable
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case
is,
how
do
you
construe
this
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
congress
intend
to
preclude
litigation
about
in
the
federal
court?
now,
if
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
that
we
decided
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
constitutional
challenges
to
this
statute,
then
your
case
is
much
different,
is
it
what
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it’s
not
--
it's
hard
to
say
about
the
state
courts,
but
at
least,
let’s
assume
we’re
clear
about
congress’
intention
with
respect
to
the
federal
courts.
because
after
all,
that’s
what
it
does
say,
courts
of
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
plaintiff
--
do
you
think
there’s
any
difference
between
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
order
to
an
officer
to
payoff
funds
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
again,
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
in
terms
of
sovereign
immunity
that
there
is
a
difference
between
asking
for
an
order
for
benefits
as
distinguished
from
the
declaration
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
do
you
think
if
you
do
ask
for
an
order
that
actually
for
an
order
to
pay
money
that
you
are
barred
by
sovereign
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
veterans
are
asking
in
terms
of
the
complaint
in
this
case,
to
enter
an
injunction
required
to
seize
refusing
to
grant
plaintiff’s
benefits?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
there
was
no
request
for
an
injunction
of
any
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
against
only
the
officials.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
would
be
an
interesting
decision
in
the
light
of
some
of
the
welfare
cases,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
do
you
think
that’s
true
if
the
claim
was
less
than
$10,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn’t
say
that
it
will
have
to
be
raisable
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
got
here
the

justice
byron
r.

it
wouldn’t
be
removal
if
federal
court
didn’t
have

justice

i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
211
said
that

not
have

of
