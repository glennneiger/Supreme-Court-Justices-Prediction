mr.
burton

schwalb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
directing
myself
to
the
point
that
has
been
raised
by
the
court
and
by
counsel
and
mainly
by
the
government,
namely;
why
is
this
case
here
and
what
is
this
prevailing
issue
that
warrants
that
consideration?
perhaps
the
best
way
for
me
to
put
it
is
not
to
paraphrase
it
but
to
quote
one
sentence
from
the
government’s
brief
because
i
think
if
any
one
sentence
in
the
brief
states
the
issue
that
warrants
the
case
being
here,
it’s
this
one.
referring
now
to
page
50.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
of
the
government’s
main
brief,
yes.
and
i
quote
about
three
quarters
of
the
way
down
the
page.
“accordingly,
this
is
not
a
situation
where
congress
has
utilized
the
board
equitable
jurisdiction
that
inheres
in
court
and
where
the
proposed
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
language
and
policy,
the
legislative
background
and
the
public
interest.”
now,
the
reason
why
this
statement
is
important
is
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
silent
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
plaintiff
suing
under
that
act
can
also
enjoin
an
agency,
which
is
preceding
with
the
procedure
to
which
the
documents
requested
relate.
what
do
you
do
in
a
situation
where
accord
its
given
equity
power
in
one
respect
under
a
statute
and
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
any
other
powers
of
that
that
district
judge
now
vested
with
at
least
partial
equity
can
do,
what
can
he
perform?
and
i
think
this
is
why
the
government
must
have
felt
that
this
issue
was
important
namely:
federal
jurisdiction
under
a
statute
creating
at
least
some
equity
jurisdiction
under
the
circumstances
but
not
stating
just
how
far
that
jurisdiction
goes.
now,
if
indeed
the
test
is
as
it
seems
to
be,
as
the
government
set
out
and
as
case
would
seem
to
set
out
that
when
a
statute
is
silent,
you
don’t
assume
that
there
is
no
further
remedy
of
jurisdiction.
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
policy
of
the
public
interest
etcetera
to
see
whether
or
not
that
extra
power
should
be
applied
in
the
act
namely,
employing
it
or
reading
it
in
or
inferring
it
or
whatever.
does
it
serve
a
public
interest?
does
it
serve
a
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind?
because
if
it
does,
it
should
be
read
in
and
there’s
many
a
case
so
holds.
and
i
think
this
is
why
the
government
has
formulated
the
issue
as
it
has
in
page
15
talking
about
legislative
history,
purpose,
and
public
interest
because
its
conclusion
is
that
what
the
district
court
did
below
was
contrary
to
the
legislative
history,
to
the
purpose,
and
to
the
public
interest.
and
therefore,
that
kind
of
an
injunction
should
not
be
implied
because
it
undercuts
rather
than
furthers
congressional
policy.
and
if
that
is
the
main
issue
which
i
think
it
is
then
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
in
the
few
minutes
that
we
have
left
because
i
think
that
the
equity
isn’t
clear.
the
government
counsel
has
said
they
are
not
contesting
the
matter
on
their
right
to
document.
that
is
something
that
is
still
left
for
the
district
court.
i
think
the
equities
are
things
that
are
better
left
to
the
district
court.
they
have
been
faced
once
on
a
preliminary
injunction
to
be
faced
again
if
the
court’s
case
was
back.
the
legislative
history
is
something
that
this
court
very
recently
explored
in
the
epa-mink
case
and
i
don’t
intend
to
spend
much
time
in
identifying
it.
there
are
basically
three
documents
i
would
like
to
refer
to.
the
freedom
of
information
act
as
it
now
is
was
senate
bill
1160
in
the
eighty-ninth
congress
first
session.
in
the
senate
report
number
813
that
accompanied
that
bill
said
on
page
7
as
follows,
“requiring
the
agencies
to
keep
a
current
index
of
their
orders,
opinions,
etcetera.
it
is
necessary
to
afford
the
private
citizen,
the
essential
information
to
enable
him
to
deal
effectively
and
knowledgeably
with
the
federal
agencies.
the
change
will
prevent
a
citizen
from
losing
a
controversy
with
an
agency
because
of
some
obscure
and
hidden
order
or
opinion
which
the
agency
knows
about
but
which
has
been
unavailable
to
the
citizen
simply
because
he
had
no
way
in
which
to
discover
it.
the
house
report
which
was
may
1966
report
in
the
second
session
of
the
eighty-ninth
congress,
report
number
1497
says
very
much
the
same
thing,
namely,
a
purpose
to
prevent
a
citizen
from
losing
a
controversy
with
an
agency.
now,
in
the
eighty-eighth
congress,
the
prior
congress,
the
senate
had
a
similar
bill.
in
fact,
i
think
that
i
can’t
represent
it
exactly
the
same.
basically,
the
same
bill
came
up
in
the
eighty-eighth
congress
and
consequently
in
the
senate,
but
i
think
it
was
passed
too
late
to
go
to
the
house
so
it
was
renewed
in
the
eighty-ninth.
but
the
senate
report
number
1219
which
accompanied
the
bill
in
the
eighty-eighth
congress.
at
page
3,
it
said
very
much
the
same
thing.
they
were
talking
about
the
old
administrative
procedure
act
3
which
permitted
disclosure
but
only
if
it
wasn’t
in
the
public
interest.
they
were
decrying
the
fact
that
the
public
interest
exception
or
notion
was
being
used
as
a
shield
to
disclosure
rather
than
an
aid.
and
said
as
follows,
“retention
of
such
an
exception”,
we
are
talking
now
about
that
section
3
of
the
exception.
in
section
3
(a)
is
therefore
inconsistent
with
this
section’s
general
objective
of
enabling
the
public
readily
to
gain
access
to
the
information
necessarily
to
deal
effectively
and
upon
equal
footing
to
the
federal
agencies.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
i
think
it
went
far
beyond
that.
it
not
only
limited
disclosure
to
those
documents
which
directly
affected
a
person
who
is
in
that
litigated
process.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
well,
i’m
not
sure.
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question.
i
thought
the
point
was,
did
that
merely
give
to
all
citizens
what
had
there
to
for
been
available
only
to
litigants
under
the
administrative
procedure.
and
my
answer
is
yes,
it
did
that
except
that
it
went
farther.
in
other
words,
the
restrictions
with
respect
to
what
kinds
of
documents
would
be
given
no
matter
what
burden
of
proof,
the
acceleration
on
court
dockets.
the
whole
notion
of
a
speedy
and
full
disclosure
by
government
agencies
was
endemic
to
this
statute,
which
began
rolling
at
the
eighty-eighth
congress
and
had
some
10
or
11
years
of
--
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
that’s
right,
your
honor.
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
relates
it
to
the
rules
of
discovery.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
well,
that
may
not
be
so,
because
for
example
--
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
well,
at
least
that
for
this
reason.
there’s
an
element
of
relevancy
or
materiality
in
terms
of
discovery
under
the
federal
rules
and
certainly
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
element
of
relevancy
and
materiality
is
not
a
prerequisite
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
consequently,
there
may
be
--
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
clearly
not.what
we
are
saying
here
is
this
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
to
permit
someone
in
a
controversy
with
an
agency
because
that
language
is
right
there
not
to
be
handed
or
not
to
lose
that
controversy
because
you
can’t
deal
on
an
equal
footing
or
cannot
deal
effectively
or
cannot
deal
efficiently
or
doesn’t
have
the
kind
of
information
that
the
agency
has.
now
that
is
exactly
what
the
injunction
below
did.
it
was
geared
to
putting
these
respondents
in
a
position
where
they
could
be
among
that
more
equal
footing,
more
efficiently,
more
knowledgeably
and
not
run
to
the
risk
of
losing
the
controversy.
now,
this
perhaps
goes
to
the
matter
of
the
legislative
history.
are
the
injunctions
below
so
contrary
to
this
legislative
history
or
policy
that
the
court
should
assume
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
it
and
that
this
violates
that
legislative
history
and
we
say
simply
no.
the
congress
was
anticipating
the
needs
of
a
litigant
because
they
used
words
that
involved
litigants.
we
know
that
there’s
an
acceleration
provision
that
litigants
often
need
information
quickly.
lilly
did
below.
this
case
was
brought
only
on
the
eve
of
being
forced
to
an
election
of
how
to
proceed
without
even
an
acknowledgment
that
the
renegotiation
board
had
received
our
request
for
documents.
now
there
is,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
for
the
moment
ahead
to
relate
in
1972
report
on
house
committee
and
government
operations
number
921419.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
a
house
report
in
1972
is
dispositive
in
what
congress
intended
or
must
have
assumed
in
1966.
but
this
very
lengthy
report
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
undertaken
from
90
pages
to
discuss
the
purpose
of
the
act
as
it
was
and
more
important
how
it
operated
in
the
six-year
period
between
1966
--
july
1966
when
the
bill
was
first
passed
and
1972.
and
without
reading
in
detail,
i
might
point
out
in
the
page
90,
there
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
regulations
of
agencies
promulgated
under
the
statute
have
not
been
effective
in
obtaining
or
requiring
the
voluntary
compliance
during
these
periods
of
years.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
i
think
that’s
there
already
by
implication.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
well,
i
have
to
that
it
would
normally
in
two
separate
context
because
this
is
going
to
be
a
norm
depending
on
what
the
context
is.
let’s
take
a
norm
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
review
of
that
procedure
anywhere.
that
is
no
subsequent
procedure
somewhere
down
the
line
with
the
propriety
of
that
action
can
be
reviewed,
studied,
analyzed,
passed
upon
and
which
might
result
in
a
reversal
and
remand
to
cure
it.
that’s
situation
a.
situation
b
is
where
that
arises
that
the
administrative
process
under
law
takes
us
through
step
by
step
by
step
and
ultimately
whether
it
would
be
to
a
district
court
or
to
court
of
appeals
such
as
a
labor
situation
for
example.
where
the
court
of
appeals
or
whatever
the
reviewing
tribunal
is
can
look
at
the
procedure.
now
taking
the
first
one
first,
a
document
is
asked
for
under
the
rules.
the
agency,
let’s
assume
on
this
hypothesis,
violates
its
own
rules
which
by
implication
--
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
all
right.
then
i
think
we
have
basically
what
would
be
a
service
dallas
type
operation,
namely:
the
agency
has,
as
part
of
its
rules,
an
obligation
to
do
a,
b,
and
c.
it
has
violated
those
rules
and
that
would
be
–-
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
yes,
but
in
the
situation
in
my
second
context,
where
we
have
reviewed.
the
courts
haven’t
said
there’s
no
jurisdiction
and
no
power,
they
have
said
that
the
evil
that
you’re
concerned
about,
the
alleged
wrong,
might
very
well
become
moot,
might
very
well
be
taken
care
of
later
on.
therefore,
why
invoke
the
power
of
the
court.
why
clutter
its
dockets?
why
cause
the
conflict
and
the
tension
between
court
and
agency
when
it
might
be
a
moot
situation?
ordinarily,
discovery
points
sometimes
can
be
looked
at
as
not
only
critical.
but
i
think
it
makes
a
difference
on
whether
or
not
people
like
these
respondents
ever
have
a
right
to
say
that
anybody
after
the
fact
we
were
not
given
the
rights
that
the
statute
or
a
regulation
or
combination
gave
us.
cure
the
defect
by
putting
us
back
in
status
quo
ante,
so
we
will
be
in
as
good
as
shape
as
we
would
if
the
agency
had
complied.
at
renegotiation,
it
can
never
happen.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
directing
myself
to
the
point
that
has
been
raised
by
the

it
now
is
was
senate
bill
1160
in
the
eighty-ninth
congress
first
session.
in
the
senate
report
number
813
that
accompanied
that
bill
said
on
page
7
as
follows,
“requiring
the
agencies
to
keep
a
current
index
of
their
orders,
opinions,
etcetera.
it
is
necessary
to
afford
the
private
citizen,
the
essential
information
to
enable
him
to
deal
effectively
and
knowledgeably
with
the
federal
agencies.
the
change
will
prevent
a
citizen
from
losing
a
controversy
with
an
agency
because
of
some
obscure
and
hidden
order
or
opinion
which
the
agency
knows
about
but
which
has
been
unavailable
to
the
citizen
simply
because
he
had
no
way
in
which
to
discover
it.
the
house
report
which
was
may
1966
report
in
the
second
session
of
the
eighty-ninth
congress,
report
number
1497
says
very
much
the
same
thing,
namely,
a
purpose
to
prevent
a
citizen
from
losing
a
controversy
with
an
agency.
now,
in
the
eighty-eighth
congress,
the
prior
congress,
the
senate
had
a
similar
bill.
in
fact,
i
think
that
i
can’t
represent
it
exactly
the
same.
basically,
the
same
bill
came
up
in
the
eighty-eighth
congress
and
consequently
in
the
senate,
but
i
think
it
was
passed
too
late
to
go
to
the
house
so
it
was
renewed
in
the
eighty-ninth.
but
the
senate
report
number
1219
which
accompanied
the
bill
in
the
eighty-eighth
congress.
at
page
3,
it
said
very
much
the
same
thing.
they
were
talking
about
the
old
administrative
procedure
act
3
which
permitted
disclosure
but
only
if
it
wasn’t
in
the
public
interest.
they
were
decrying
the
fact
that
the
public
interest
exception
or
notion
was
being
used
as
a
shield
to
disclosure
rather
than
an
aid.
and
said
as
follows,
“retention
of
such
an
exception”,
we
are
talking
now
about
that
section
3
of
the
exception.
in
section
3
(a)
is
therefore
inconsistent
with
this
section’s
general
objective
of
enabling
the
public
readily
to
gain
access
to
the
information
necessarily
to
deal
effectively
and
upon
equal
footing
to
the
federal
agencies.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
i
think
it
went
far
beyond
that.
it
not
only
limited
disclosure
to
those
documents
which
directly
affected
a
person
who
is
in
that
litigated
process.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
well,
i’m
not
sure.
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question.
i
thought
the
point
was,
did
that
merely
give
to
all
citizens
what
had
there
to
for
been
available
only
to
litigants
under
the
administrative
procedure.
and
my
answer
is
yes,
it
did
that
except
that
it
went
farther.
in
other
words,
the
restrictions
with
respect
to
what
kinds
of
documents
would
be
given
no
matter
what
burden
of
proof,
the
acceleration
on
court
dockets.
the
whole
notion
of
a
speedy
and
full
disclosure
by
government
agencies
was
endemic
to
this
statute,
which
began
rolling
at
the
eighty-eighth
congress
and
had
some
10
or
11
years
of
--
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
that’s
right,
your
honor.
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
relates
it
to
the
rules
of
discovery.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
well,
that
may
not
be
so,
because
for
example
--
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
well,
at
least
that
for
this
reason.
there’s
an
element
of
relevancy
or
materiality
in
terms
of
discovery
under
the
federal
rules
and
certainly
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
element
of
relevancy
and
materiality
is
not
a
prerequisite
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
consequently,
there
may
be
--
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
clearly
not.what
we
are
saying
here
is
this
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
to
permit
someone
in
a
controversy
with
an
agency
because
that
language
is
right
there
not
to
be
handed
or
not
to
lose
that
controversy
because
you
can’t
deal
on
an
equal
footing
or
cannot
deal
effectively
or
cannot
deal
efficiently
or
doesn’t
have
the
kind
of
information
that
the
agency
has.
now
that
is
exactly
what
the
injunction
below
did.
it
was
geared
to
putting
these
respondents
in
a
position
where
they
could
be
among
that
more
equal
footing,
more
efficiently,
more
knowledgeably
and
not
run
to
the
risk
of
losing
the
controversy.
now,
this
perhaps
goes
to
the
matter
of
the
legislative
history.
are
the
injunctions
below
so
contrary
to
this
legislative
history
or
policy
that
the
court
should
assume
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
it
and
that
this
violates
that
legislative
history
and
we
say
simply
no.
the
congress
was
anticipating
the
needs
of
a
litigant
because
they
used
words
that
involved
litigants.
we
know
that
there’s
an
acceleration
provision
that
litigants
often
need
information
quickly.
lilly
did
below.
this
case
was
brought
only
on
the
eve
of
being
forced
to
an
election
of
how
to
proceed
without
even
an
acknowledgment
that
the
renegotiation
board
had
received
our
request
for
documents.
now
there
is,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
for
the
moment
ahead
to
relate
in
1972
report
on
house
committee
and
government
operations
number
921419.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
a
house
report
in
1972
is
dispositive
in
what
congress
intended
or
must
have
assumed
in
1966.
but
this
very
lengthy
report
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
undertaken
from
90
pages
to
discuss
the
purpose
of
the
act
as
it
was
and
more
important
how
it
operated
in
the
six-year
period
between
1966
--
july
1966
when
the
bill
was
first
passed
and
1972.
and
without
reading
in
detail,
i
might
point
out
in
the
page
90,
there
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
regulations
of
agencies
promulgated
under
the
statute
have
not
been
effective
in
obtaining
or
requiring
the
voluntary
compliance
during
these
periods
of
years.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
i
think
that’s
there
already
by
implication.
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
well,
i
have
to
that
it
would
normally
in
two
separate
context
because
this
is
going
to
be
a
norm
depending
on
what
the
context
is.
let’s
take
a
norm
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
review
of
that
procedure
anywhere.
that
is
no
subsequent
procedure
somewhere
down
the
line
with
the
propriety
of
that
action
can
be
reviewed,
studied,
analyzed,
passed
upon
and
which
might
result
in
a
reversal
and
remand
to
cure
it.
that’s
situation
a.
situation
b
is
where
that
arises
that
the
administrative
process
under
law
takes
us
through
step
by
step
by
step
and
ultimately
whether
it
would
be
to
a
district
court
or
to
court
of
appeals
such
as
a
labor
situation
for
example.
where
the
court
of
appeals
or
whatever
the
reviewing
tribunal
is
can
look
at
the
procedure.
now
taking
the
first
one
first,
a
document
is
asked
for
under
the
rules.
the
agency,
let’s
assume
on
this
hypothesis,
violates
its
own
rules
which
by
implication
--
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
all
right.
then
i
think
we
have
basically
what
would
be
a
service
dallas
type
operation,
namely:
the
agency
has,
as
part
of
its
rules,
an
obligation
to
do
a,
b,
and
c.
it
has
violated
those
rules
and
that
would
be
–-
mr.
burton
a.
schwalb
yes,
but
in
the
situation
in
my
second
context,
where
we
have
reviewed.
the
courts
haven’t
said
there’s
no
jurisdiction
and
no
power,
they
have
said
that
the
evil
that
you’re
concerned
about,
the
alleged
wrong,
might
very
well
become
moot,
might
very
well
be
taken
care
of
later
on.
therefore,
why
invoke
the
power
of
the
court.
why
clutter
its
dockets?
why
cause
the
conflict
and
the
tension
between
court
and
agency
when
it
might
be
a
moot
situation?
ordinarily,
discovery
points
sometimes
can
be
looked
at
as
not
only
critical.
but
i
think
it
makes
a
difference
on
whether
or
not
people
like
these
respondents
ever
have
a
right
to
say
that
anybody
after
the
fact
we
were
not
given
the
rights
that
the
statute
or
a
regulation
or
combination
gave
us.
cure
the
defect
by
putting
us
back
in
status
quo
ante,
so
we
will
be
in
as
good
as
shape
as
we
would
if
the
agency
had
complied.
at
renegotiation,
it
can
never
happen.
