ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia,
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
a
petition
of
the
renegotiation
board.
it
is
a
suit
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
that
act
provides
that
any
member
of
the
public
is
entitled
to
non-exempt
federal
agency
records.
if
the
party
requesting
records
does
not
receive
them
from
the
agency
voluntarily,
he
is
entitled
to
sue
in
the
district
court
to
compel
the
production
of
the
records.
the
plaintiffs
are
government
contractors
who
are
negotiating
to
determine
whether
they
must
refund
excess
profits
to
the
government.
they
have
sued
to
compel
the
board
to
produce
documents
relating
to
their
renegotiation
proceedings.
the
district
court
in
this
freedom
of
information
act
suits
issued
temporary
injunctions
against
the
continued
conduct
of
the
negotiation
procedures
pending
the
resolution
of
the
court
of
claim
--
the
freedom
of
information
act
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
those
rulings,
the
government
is
here
appealing
on
that
issue.
the
merits
of
the
party’s
freedom
of
information
act
claims
are
not
before
this
court.
in
order
to
evaluate
the
issues
in
this
case,
it
is
important
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
renegotiation
act
proceedings.
the
renegotiation
act
requires
the
board
to
try
to
reach
an
agreement
with
government
contractors
concerning
the
amount
of
excess
profits
they
have
earned
which
they
should
refund
to
the
government.
the
board
is
involved
in
negotiations
essentially
in
offers
of
settlement
rather
than
in
adjudications
on
the
merits
of
the
claims.
they
attempt
to
reach
settlement
by
a
series
of
essentially
five
different
negotiating
levels
within
the
board,
there’s
regional
board
and
national
board,
and
you
negotiate
through
five
levels.
the
contractor
submits
statements
giving
financial
statements.
the
board
then
considers
the
statements,
meets
with
the
contractor,
and
makes
an
offer
in
settlement.
the
contractor
is
then
entitled
to
a
statement
giving
the
basis
for
that
settlement
offer
in
order
for
him
to
determine
whether
he
was
just
to
accept
it
or
to
require
the
board
to
negotiate
again
at
a
higher
level.
and
of
course,
at
each
level,
the
board
may
increase
or
decrease
the
amount
of
the
offer
in
settlement.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
if
no
settlement
is
reached
within
the
board,
the
board
issues
an
assessment,
a
determination
of
the
amount
of
the
contractor’s
liability.
then
the
contractor
is
entitled
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
claims,
that
trial
is
de
novo.
the
government
must
prove
the
amount
of
the
contractor’s
liability
and
the
proceedings
in
the
board
are
simply
not
relevant
to
the
court
of
claims
determination.
of
course,
the
contractor
when
he
gets
to
the
court
of
claims
is
entitled
to
use
the
court
of
claims’
discovery
procedures.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
to
the
extent
that
they
were
relevant
and
were
not
otherwise
privileged,
yes,
there’s
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
some
of
them
may
be
work
product
and
therefore
privileged.
it’s
the
court
of
claims
discovery
procedures
are
as
broad
as
the
freedom
of
information.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
board
proceedings
can
be
enjoined
–-
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
administrative
proceeding
has
to
be
concluded.
certainly,
the
court
of
claims
would
not
be
acting
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
they
would
be
acting
under
their
discovery
procedures.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
part
of
it.
their
requests
were
very
broad
and
what
they
requested
were
documents
related
to
the
renegotiation
procedure.
the
exact
scope
of
quick
documents
there,
whether
or
not
they
are
entitled
to
them
is
of
course
in
the
court
of
claims.
but
there
is
a
very
broad
request
for
documents.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
right.
yes.
these
documents
are
not
documents
which
the
renegotiation
board
ordinarily
supplies.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
no.
not
really.
this
court
held
in
aircraft
and
diesel
equipment
corporation
against
hirsch
that
these
proceedings
were
not
to
be
enjoined
even
when
as
in
that
case,
the
contractor
alleged
that
he
had
been
unable
to
participate
effectively
in
the
proceedings
because
he
did
not
have
information
upon
which
the
board
had
relied.
the
court,
nevertheless,
found
that
congress
had
intended
the
entire
negotiation
ending
with
the
adjudication
was
supposed
to
be
completed
without
judicial
interference.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it’s
very
broad.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
certainly
you
would
have
trouble
on
the
breadth
of
that
in
the
court
of
claims.
you
would
also
have
a
great
trouble
on
the
breadth
of
that
on
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
to
alter
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
aircraft
and
diesel
equipment
corporation
against
hirsch
at
least
to
the
extent
of
permitting
temporary
injunctions
against
board
procedures
while
freedom
of
information
act
questions
are
litigated.
our
contention
is
that
this
is
a
misinterpretation
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
not
designed
to
permit
courts
to
review
agency
rulings
on
the
scope
of
discovery
in
pending
proceedings.
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
specifically
intended
to
change
the
rule
that
had
existed
before
that
those
properly
and
directly
concerned
had
a
greater
right
to
agency
records
than
others.
instead,
the
freedom
of
information
act
indicated
that
all
members
of
the
public
have
an
equal
right
to
the
use
of
agency
records
regardless
of
the
use
that
they
intend
to
make
of
them.
the
contractors
here
claim
that
the
special
use
they
wish
to
make
of
these
records
entitles
them
to
a
special
remedy.
but
what
the
act
says
is
that
all
members
of
the
public
have
an
equal
right
to
a
prompt
resolution
of
their
claims
of
entitlement
to
documents.
the
congress
provided
a
very
specific
remedy
to
protect
the
specific
right,
which
they
established.
and
in
that
remedy,
they
emphasized
the
importance
of
speed.
they
provided
that
the
suits
to
compel
the
production
of
documents
should
be
given
priority
on
the
district
court’s
docket
and
expedited
in
every
way.
if
the
remedy,
which
the
court
below
found
is
permitted,
it
will
tip
the
balance
that
congress
established
instead
of
making
the
freedom
of
information
act
claims
promptly
determined,
instead,
it
will
become
a
very
effective
tool
for
delay.
for
once
people
in
the
position
of
the
contractors
here
have
obtained
a
stay
of
the
proceeding,
which
threatens
them,
they
have
no
interest
in
the
prompt
resolution
of
their
claims
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
instead,
their
interest
is
entirely
in
delaying
the
resolution
of
these
claims
and
therefore
delaying
the
continuation
of
the
administrative
procedure
which
can
affect
them
adversely.
even
if
the
state
rarely
granted
the
existence
of
the
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
remedy
will
encourage
litigation,
this
is
a
possible
means
of
obtaining
a
delay
of
the
agency
action.
we
therefore
contend
that
the
issuance
of
injunctions
against
the
continuation
of
agency
proceedings
is
not
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
that
the
courts
below
expanded
on
the
act
and
acted
legislatively
rather
than
judicially.
certainly,
congress
could
have
concluded
the
specific
uses
to
be
made
of
the
information
just
to
find
specific
protections.
they
could
have
concluded
that
the
interests
of
those
involved
in
agency
proceedings
were
so
important
that
it
was
appropriate
to
require
the
courts
to
review
agency
rulings
on
the
scope
of
discovery
and
pending
procedures
proceedings.
we
contend
that
the
act
simply
does
not
do
so.
if
it
had
intended
to
change
the
traditional
allocation
of
responsibilities
between
agencies
and
courts,
they
would
have
said
so
clearly
and
there
is
no
indication
of
any
such
intent.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
in
these
cases
was
consistent
with
the
traditional
equitable
power
to
maintain
the
status
quo
because
in
this
case,
it
was
not
a
situation
in
which
a
court
has
acted
to
stay
agency
action
while
it
determines
the
validity
of
that
agency
action.
instead,
what
they
did
was
to
stay
the
agency
proceedings
while
they
reviewed
the
validity
of
collateral
agency
action.
in
effect,
they
have
stayed
the
renegotiation
board
proceedings
while
they
reviewed
the
board’s
determination
of
the
proper
scope
of
discovery.
and
this
is
certainly
not
a
traditional
exercise
of
equitable
power.
in
some,
as
this
court
recognized
last
term
in
environmental
protection
agency
against
mink.
the
freedom
of
information
act
provides
a
workable
formula
which
carefully
protects
and
balances
all
interests.
the
act
protects
the
public
interest
and
prompt
access
to
government
records.
it
also
protects
the
public
interest
in
minimal
of
interference
with
efficient
government
operations.
the
specific
remedy
that
they
provided
is
an
important
part
of
this
balance.
the
additional
remedy
that
the
court
below
granted
upsets
this
careful
balance
and
it
does
not,
if
not,
in
order
to
achieve
the
purposes
of
the
statute
which
is
a
prompt
availability
of
government
records.
but
instead,
to
give
the
contractors
the
specific
benefit
in
their
negotiations
with
the
board.
this
is
simply
not
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
court
below,
nevertheless,
found
that
the
district
court
had
properly
exercised
not
only
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
agency
proceedings
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
but
that
it
had
properly
exercised
this
jurisdiction.
since
unless
the
proceedings
--
renegotiation
proceedings
were
enjoined,
the
contractors
would
be
irreparably
injured
if
they
were
compelled
to
negotiate
without
the
information
they
wanted.
and
since
there
was
no
review
as
such
of
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
believe
this
is
incorrect
in
both
of
the
aircraft
case
and
in
lichter
against
united
states,
this
court
recognized
that
the
renegotiation
procedures
were
designed
to
be
very
informal
and
that
they
were
not
to
be
adjudications
with
the
discovery,
formal
discovery.
they
are
not
subject
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
they
are
designed
to
help
the
defense
and
effort
by
obtaining
rampant
settlement
in
procurement
matters
and
they
are
not
designed
to
help
the
contractors
get
a
more
favorable
settlement
than
they
might
be
entitled
to
by
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
so
the
contractors
are
not
entitled
to
the
most
favorable
settlement
that
they
could
reach
if
they
were
negotiating
with
full
information.
what
they
are
entitled
to
is
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
merits
of
their
liability
and
that
is
what
is
provided
in
the
renegotiation
act.
furthermore,
the
fact
that
the
review
in
the
court
of
claims
is
de
novo
does
not
mean
that
there
is
any
irreparable
injury
if
they
don’t
get
the
information
before.
if
they
are
not
satisfied
that
the
board
determination
is
fair,
they
may
get
a
determination
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
at
that
point,
the
prior
board
procedures
are
irrelevant.
in
one
sense,
they
are
in
a
better
position
than
they
would
be
if
there
was
a
review
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims.
since
the
court
of
claims
does
not
need
to
consider
whether
there’s
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
board
procedures
and
they
may
not
show
that
they
received
any
prejudice
from
board
procedures.
in
short,
the
board
procedures
can
impose
no
continuing
disadvantage
on
the
contractors.
and
therefore
the
enjoining
of
those
procedures
was
improper.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
legislative
history
that
the
counsel
pointed
to,
indicating
that
one
of
the
intents
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
to
prevent
people
from
losing
a
controversy
within
agency
on
a
basis
of
secret
information
is
a
discussion,
a
section
of
the
act,
which
requires
the
indexing
of
agency
opinions
and
essentially
agency
case
law,
the
end
product
of
the
administrative
actions.
that
section
requires
not
only
the
indexing
of
these
materials
but
it
also
provides
that
none
of
the
materials
that’s
required
to
be
indexed
and
has
not
been
indexed
may
be
relied
upon
as
a
precedent
against
anyone
who
hasn’t
been
informed
of
these
secret
laws.
this
is
quite
a
different
situation
from
the
situation
that’s
in
this
case.
and
in
effect,
there
was
a
specific
provision
for
this
specific
problem
in
the
act.
you
simply
can’t
rely
on
that
information
or
on
those
decisions.
also,
the
contention
that
the
fact
that
there
is
no
statutory
review
of
the
renegotiation
procedures
here
means
that
in
this
case,
there
is
jurisdiction
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
enjoin
agency
procedures.
this
is
an
incorrect
analysis,
i
believe.
i
think
that
whether
or
not
there’s
jurisdiction
to
review
agency
procedures
goes
to
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
it
doesn’t
go
to
the
existence
of
that
jurisdiction.
in
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
sears,
roebuck
case
found
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
agency
proceedings
against
the
nlrb.
they
also
mentioned
that
there
would
be
a
review
of
the
nlrb
procedures
later
but
the
question
is,
is
really
jurisdiction
not
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction?
i
don’t
agree
that
there
it’s
clear
that
the
contractors
are
entitled
to
any
of
the
information
that
they
have
asked
for.
the
grumman
case
that
they
referred
to
the
petition
for
rehearing
has
been
denied
but
the
government’s
time
to
petition
for
certiorari
hasn’t
expired
and
it
would
settle
some
of
the
issues
it
wouldn’t
settle
all
of
them.
the
fact
that
performance
information
is
available
under
the
regulations
now
doesn’t
necessarily
mean
that
the
performance
information
supplied
earlier
in
bannercraft
would
be
since
under
the
new
regulations
when
the
board
asks
the
various
contractors
to
supply
the
information
to
the
board.
the
request
indicates
that
this
information
will
be
made
available
to
the
contractor
before
the
request
indicated
that
it
would
be
kept
confidential
and
so
there
is
a
question
of
protecting
an
assurance
of
confidentiality.
the
only
other
point
i
had
was
that
once
the
statutory
board
makes
a
final
determination
that
is
the
determination,
the
contractor
can
still
make
a
compromise
offer
and
that
may
be
considered.
it
will
be
considered
by
the
board
if
the
board’s
action
doesn’t
become
final
until
it
makes
an
order.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
certainly
agree
that
the
principles
–-
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
board’s
regulations
do
contain
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
documents
that
has
been
made
available
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
right.
that’s
the
point.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
it
does
because
the
freedom
of
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
if
the
rule
were
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
i
believe
that
under
aircraft
and
lichter
v.
u.s.,
the
court
has
said
that
you
don’t
enjoin
renegotiation
act
proceedings.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia,
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
a
petition
of
the
renegotiation
board.
it
is
a
suit
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
that
act
provides
that
any
member
of
the
public
is
entitled
to
non-exempt
federal
agency
records.
if
the
party
requesting
records
does
not
receive
them
from
the
agency
voluntarily,
he
is
entitled
to
sue
in
the
district
court
to
compel
the
production
of
the
records.
the
plaintiffs
are
government
contractors
who
are
negotiating
to
determine
whether
they
must
refund
excess
profits
to
the
government.
they
have
sued
to
compel

board
to
produce
documents
relating
to
their
renegotiation
proceedings.
the
district
court
in
this
freedom
of
information
act
suits
issued
temporary
injunctions
against
the
continued
conduct
of
the
negotiation
procedures
pending
the
resolution
of
the
court
of
claim
--
the
freedom
of
information
act
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
those
rulings,
the
government
is
here
appealing
on
that
issue.
the
merits
of
the
party’s
freedom
of
information
act
claims
are
not
before
this
court.
in
order
to
evaluate
the
issues
in
this
case,
it
is
important
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
renegotiation
act
proceedings.
the
renegotiation
act
requires
the
board
to
try
to
reach
an
agreement
with
government
contractors
concerning
the
amount
of
excess
profits
they
have
earned
which
they
should
refund
to
the
government.
the
board
is
involved
in
negotiations
essentially
in
offers
of
settlement
rather
than
in
adjudications
on
the
merits
of
the
claims.
they
attempt
to
reach
settlement
by
a
series
of
essentially
five
different
negotiating
levels
within
the
board,
there’s
regional
board
and
national
board,
and
you
negotiate
through
five
levels.
the
contractor
submits
statements
giving
financial
statements.
the
board
then
considers
the
statements,
meets
with
the
contractor,
and
makes
an
offer
in
settlement.
the
contractor
is
then
entitled
to
a
statement
giving
the
basis
for
that
settlement
offer
in
order
for
him
to
determine
whether
he
was
just
to
accept
it
or
to
require
the
board
to
negotiate
again
at
a
higher
level.
and
of
course,
at
each
level,
the
board
may
increase
or
decrease
the
amount
of
the
offer
in
settlement.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
if
no
settlement
is
reached
within
the
board,
the
board
issues
an
assessment,
a
determination
of
the
amount
of
the
contractor’s
liability.
then
the
contractor
is
entitled
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
claims,
that
trial
is
de
novo.
the
government
must
prove
the
amount
of
the
contractor’s
liability
and
the
proceedings
in
the
board
are
simply
not
relevant
to
the
court
of
claims
determination.
of
course,
the
contractor
when
he
gets
to
the
court
of
claims
is
entitled
to
use
the
court
of
claims’
discovery
procedures.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
to
the
extent
that
they
were
relevant
and
were
not
otherwise
privileged,
yes,
there’s
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
some
of
them
may
be
work
product
and
therefore
privileged.
it’s
the
court
of
claims
discovery
procedures
are
as
broad
as
the
freedom
of
information.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
board
proceedings
can
be
enjoined
–-
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
administrative
proceeding
has
to
be
concluded.
certainly,
the
court
of
claims
would
not
be
acting
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
they
would
be
acting
under
their
discovery
procedures.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
part
of
it.
their
requests
were
very
broad
and
what
they
requested
were
documents
related
to
the
renegotiation
procedure.
the
exact
scope
of
quick
documents
there,
whether
or
not
they
are
entitled
to
them
is
of
course
in
the
court
of
claims.
but
there
is
a
very
broad
request
for
documents.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
right.
yes.
these
documents
are
not
documents
which
the
renegotiation
board
ordinarily
supplies.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
no.
not
really.
this
court
held
in
aircraft
and
diesel
equipment
corporation
against
hirsch
that
these
proceedings
were
not
to
be
enjoined
even
when
as
in
that
case,
the
contractor
alleged
that
he
had
been
unable
to
participate
effectively
in
the
proceedings
because
he
did
not
have
information
upon
which
the
board
had
relied.
the
court,
nevertheless,
found
that
congress
had
intended
the
entire
negotiation
ending
with
the
adjudication
was
supposed
to
be
completed
without
judicial
interference.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it’s
very
broad.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
certainly
you
would
have
trouble
on
the
breadth
of
that
in
the
court
of
claims.
you
would
also
have
a
great
trouble
on
the
breadth
of
that
on
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
to
alter
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
aircraft
and
diesel
equipment
corporation
against
hirsch
at
least
to
the
extent
of
permitting
temporary
injunctions
against
board
procedures
while
freedom
of
information
act
questions
are
litigated.
our
contention
is
that
this
is
a
misinterpretation
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
not
designed
to
permit
courts
to
review
agency
rulings
on
the
scope
of
discovery
in
pending
proceedings.
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
specifically
intended
to
change
the
rule
that
had
existed
before
that
those
properly
and
directly
concerned
had
a
greater
right
to
agency
records
than
others.
instead,
the
freedom
of
information
act
indicated
that
all
members
of
the
public
have
an
equal
right
to
the
use
of
agency
records
regardless
of
the
use
that
they
intend
to
make
of
them.
the
contractors
here
claim
that
the
special
use
they
wish
to
make
of
these
records
entitles
them
to
a
special
remedy.
but
what
the
act
says
is
that
all
members
of
the
public
have
an
equal
right
to
a
prompt
resolution
of
their
claims
of
entitlement
to
documents.
the
congress
provided
a
very
specific
remedy
to
protect
the
specific
right,
which
they
established.
and
in
that
remedy,
they
emphasized
the
importance
of
speed.
they
provided
that
the
suits
to
compel
the
production
of
documents
should
be
given
priority
on
the
district
court’s
docket
and
expedited
in
every
way.
if
the
remedy,
which
the
court
below
found
is
permitted,
it
will
tip
the
balance
that
congress
established
instead
of
making
the
freedom
of
information
act
claims
promptly
determined,
instead,
it
will
become
a
very
effective
tool
for
delay.
for
once
people
in
the
position
of
the
contractors
here
have
obtained
a
stay
of
the
proceeding,
which
threatens
them,
they
have
no
interest
in
the
prompt
resolution
of
their
claims
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
instead,
their
interest
is
entirely
in
delaying
the
resolution
of
these
claims
and
therefore
delaying
the
continuation
of
the
administrative
procedure
which
can
affect
them
adversely.
even
if
the
state
rarely
granted
the
existence
of
the
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
remedy
will
encourage
litigation,
this
is
a
possible
means
of
obtaining
a
delay
of
the
agency
action.
we
therefore
contend
that
the
issuance
of
injunctions
against
the
continuation
of
agency
proceedings
is
not
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
that
the
courts
below
expanded
on
the
act
and
acted
legislatively
rather
than
judicially.
certainly,
congress
could
have
concluded
the
specific
uses
to
be
made
of
the
information
just
to
find
specific
protections.
they
could
have
concluded
that
the
interests
of
those
involved
in
agency
proceedings
were
so
important
that
it
was
appropriate
to
require
the
courts
to
review
agency
rulings
on
the
scope
of
discovery
and
pending
procedures
proceedings.
we
contend
that
the
act
simply
does
not
do
so.
if
it
had
intended
to
change
the
traditional
allocation
of
responsibilities
between
agencies
and
courts,
they
would
have
said
so
clearly
and
there
is
no
indication
of
any
such
intent.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
in
these
cases
was
consistent
with
the
traditional
equitable
power
to
maintain
the
status
quo
because
in
this
case,
it
was
not
a
situation
in
which
a
court
has
acted
to
stay
agency
action
while
it
determines
the
validity
of
that
agency
action.
instead,
what
they
did
was
to
stay
the
agency
proceedings
while
they
reviewed
the
validity
of
collateral
agency
action.
in
effect,
they
have
stayed
the
renegotiation
board
proceedings
while
they
reviewed
the
board’s
determination
of
the
proper
scope
of
discovery.
and
this
is
certainly
not
a
traditional
exercise
of
equitable
power.
in
some,
as
this
court
recognized
last
term
in
environmental
protection
agency
against
mink.
the
freedom
of
information
act
provides
a
workable
formula
which
carefully
protects
and
balances
all
interests.
the
act
protects
the
public
interest
and
prompt
access
to
government
records.
it
also
protects
the
public
interest
in
minimal
of
interference
with
efficient
government
operations.
the
specific
remedy
that
they
provided
is
an
important
part
of
this
balance.
the
additional
remedy
that
the
court
below
granted
upsets
this
careful
balance
and
it
does
not,
if
not,
in
order
to
achieve
the
purposes
of
the
statute
which
is
a
prompt
availability
of
government
records.
but
instead,
to
give
the
contractors
the
specific
benefit
in
their
negotiations
with
the
board.
this
is
simply
not
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
court
below,
nevertheless,
found
that
the
district
court
had
properly
exercised
not
only
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
agency
proceedings
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
but
that
it
had
properly
exercised
this
jurisdiction.
since
unless
the
proceedings
--
renegotiation
proceedings
were
enjoined,
the
contractors
would
be
irreparably
injured
if
they
were
compelled
to
negotiate
without
the
information
they
wanted.
and
since
there
was
no
review
as
such
of
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
believe
this
is
incorrect
in
both
of
the
aircraft
case
and
in
lichter
against
united
states,
this
court
recognized
that
the
renegotiation
procedures
were
designed
to
be
very
informal
and
that
they
were
not
to
be
adjudications
with
the
discovery,
formal
discovery.
they
are
not
subject
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
they
are
designed
to
help
the
defense
and
effort
by
obtaining
rampant
settlement
in
procurement
matters
and
they
are
not
designed
to
help
the
contractors
get
a
more
favorable
settlement
than
they
might
be
entitled
to
by
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
so
the
contractors
are
not
entitled
to
the
most
favorable
settlement
that
they
could
reach
if
they
were
negotiating
with
full
information.
what
they
are
entitled
to
is
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
merits
of
their
liability
and
that
is
what
is
provided
in
the
renegotiation
act.
furthermore,
the
fact
that
the
review
in
the
court
of
claims
is
de
novo
does
not
mean
that
there
is
any
irreparable
injury
if
they
don’t
get
the
information
before.
if
they
are
not
satisfied
that
the
board
determination
is
fair,
they
may
get
a
determination
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
at
that
point,
the
prior
board
procedures
are
irrelevant.
in
one
sense,
they
are
in
a
better
position
than
they
would
be
if
there
was
a
review
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims.
since
the
court
of
claims
does
not
need
to
consider
whether
there’s
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
board
procedures
and
they
may
not
show
that
they
received
any
prejudice
from
board
procedures.
in
short,
the
board
procedures
can
impose
no
continuing
disadvantage
on
the
contractors.
and
therefore
the
enjoining
of
those
procedures
was
improper.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
legislative
history
that
the
counsel
pointed
to,
indicating
that
one
of
the
intents
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
to
prevent
people
from
losing
a
controversy
within
agency
on
a
basis
of
secret
information
is
a
discussion,
a
section
of
the
act,
which
requires
the
indexing
of
agency
opinions
and
essentially
agency
case
law,
the
end
product
of
the
administrative
actions.
that
section
requires
not
only
the
indexing
of
these
materials
but
it
also
provides
that
none
of
the
materials
that’s
required
to
be
indexed
and
has
not
been
indexed
may
be
relied
upon
as
a
precedent
against
anyone
who
hasn’t
been
informed
of
these
secret
laws.
this
is
quite
a
different
situation
from
the
situation
that’s
in
this
case.
and
in
effect,
there
was
a
specific
provision
for
this
specific
problem
in
the
act.
you
simply
can’t
rely
on
that
information
or
on
those
decisions.
also,
the
contention
that
the
fact
that
there
is
no
statutory
review
of
the
renegotiation
procedures
here
means
that
in
this
case,
there
is
jurisdiction
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
enjoin
agency
procedures.
this
is
an
incorrect
analysis,
i
believe.
i
think
that
whether
or
not
there’s
jurisdiction
to
review
agency
procedures
goes
to
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
it
doesn’t
go
to
the
existence
of
that
jurisdiction.
in
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
sears,
roebuck
case
found
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
agency
proceedings
against
the
nlrb.
they
also
mentioned
that
there
would
be
a
review
of
the
nlrb
procedures
later
but
the
question
is,
is
really
jurisdiction
not
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction?
i
don’t
agree
that
there
it’s
clear
that
the
contractors
are
entitled
to
any
of
the
information
that
they
have
asked
for.
the
grumman
case
that
they
referred
to
the
petition
for
rehearing
has
been
denied
but
the
government’s
time
to
petition
for
certiorari
hasn’t
expired
and
it
would
settle
some
of
the
issues
it
wouldn’t
settle
all
of
them.
the
fact
that
performance
information
is
available
under
the
regulations
now
doesn’t
necessarily
mean
that
the
performance
information
supplied
earlier
in
bannercraft
would
be
since
under
the
new
regulations
when
the
board
asks
the
various
contractors
to
supply
the
information
to
the
board.
the
request
indicates
that
this
information
will
be
made
available
to
the
contractor
before
the
request
indicated
that
it
would
be
kept
confidential
and
so
there
is
a
question
of
protecting
an
assurance
of
confidentiality.
the
only
other
point
i
had
was
that
once
the
statutory
board
makes
a
final
determination
that
is
the
determination,
the
contractor
can
still
make
a
compromise
offer
and
that
may
be
considered.
it
will
be
considered
by
the
board
if
the
board’s
action
doesn’t
become
final
until
it
makes
an
order.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
certainly
agree
that
the
principles
–-
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
board’s
regulations
do
contain
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
documents
that
has
been
made
available
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that’s
right.
that’s
the
point.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
it
does
because
the
freedom
of
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
if
the
rule
were
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
i
believe
that
under
aircraft
and
lichter
v.
u.s.,
the
court
has
said
that
you
don’t
enjoin
renegotiation
act
proceedings.
