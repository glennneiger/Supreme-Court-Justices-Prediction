mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
at
the
onset
note
sharp
disagreement
with
a
couple
of
statements
of
government
counsel.
first,
the
regulations
of
the
board
as
they
were
amended
last
november
--
november
197,
in
fact
provide
that
from
now
on,
a
contractor
on
request
will
get
all
of
the
information,
i
believe
that
bannercraft
asked
for
and
most
of
the
information
that
the
other
contractors
asked
for.
for
example
in
32
cfr
section
1472.7,
the
regulations
of
the
board
now
provide
that
a
contractor
may
have
on
request
the
performance
information.
that
is
the
performance
evaluation
of
other
agencies
of
government.
or
in
the
case
of
a
subcontractor-prime
contractor
relationship,
the
performance
information
provided
by
prime
contractor
on
the
level
of
performance
of
the
subcontractor.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
i
think
the
board
–-
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
did?
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
assuming
that
the
board
complies
fully
with
their
own
regulations,
and
with
the
further
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
grumman
aircraft
this
summer,
i
think
there’s
nothing
left
of
this
case.
if
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
grumman
decided
in
july
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
yes,
sir.
the
new
regulation,
yes,
as
implemented
by
grumman.
the
grumman
decision
simply
says,
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
grumman
is
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
which
only
relates
to
one
portion.
i
might
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
section
1418.5
of
the
regulations.
there
are
15
categories
of
documents
that
are
now
made
available
by
the
renegotiation
board.
they
were
not
made
available
when
we
first
filed
this
lawsuit.
they
do
include
agreements
determining
excessive
profits,
orders
determining
the
excessive
profits,
statement
of
facts
and
the
reasons
issued
by
the
board
and
so
on.
now,
at
the
bottom
of
that
section
it
says
this
–-
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
we
are
not
going
back
to
seek
them
and
the
board
has
not
made
them
available.
we
have
exhausted
our
remedies
if
the
court
please.
we
have
no
remedy
left
at
the
board
level.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
no,
sir.
we
filed
our
request
for
information
to
the
secretary;
that
was
denied.
we
went
to
the
board.
the
board
denied
our
final
request.
there’s
no
time
period
that
i
know
of
within
which
we
could
go
back
and
ask
for
reconsideration.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
i
think
this
is
a
change
in
the
regulation
in
our
favor
but
it
was
just
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
i
am
not
sure
of
the
board’s
point
of
view,
your
honor.
but
i
would
assume
that
if
the
board
wanted
to,
they
could
have
then
communicated.
they
gave
us
some
documents
which
were
worthless
that
the
district
courts
have
found.
they
could
have
simply
responded
further
to
our
request
which
was
pending
before
the
board
and
said
we
are
going
to
make
available,
these
documents,
we
may
or
may
not
have
an
issue
of
that
before
the
district
court.
if
we
had
one,
it
would
have
been
very
narrow.
i
submit
because
the
only
issue
left,
really,
is
the
issue
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
grumman.
now
if
the
board
--
of
course,
i
cannot
predict
how
the
board
is
going
to
apply
these
regulations.
but
i
assume
if
the
board
complied
with
the
spared
--
other
regulations
is
implemented
by
grumman
that
we
would
have
very
little
remaining
an
issue.
these
documents
are
not
only
available
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
but
they
are
critically
important
to
the
conduct
of
renegotiation,
and
there
again
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well
–-
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
the
freedom
of
information
act,
if
the
court
please,
i
submit
is
an
important
national
policy
which
should
be
read
in
conjunction
with
all
existing
statutes
and
it’s
clearly
applicable
to
the
renegotiation
board.
there’s
no
argument
there
and
the
renegotiation
board
should
not
be
permitted
to
ignore
its
responsibilities
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
continue
with
renegotiation
because
the
importance
of
these
documents
comes
down
to
this.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
no,
your
honor.
well,
there’s
only
one
group
that
i
know
of,
not
our
clients.
but
only
one
group
that
i
know
of
and
that’s
the
group
of
georgetown
students.
their
request
resulted
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
fisher
versus
renegotiation
board.
but
it's
unlikely,
that
any
public
interest
group
would
request
documents
from
the
board
except
maybe
a
group
of
law
students
or
an
effective
contractor.
i
think
in
some
sense,
we
in
there
not
only
on
our
own
behalf
but
on
the
concept
of
a
private
attorney
general.
we
are
suggesting
that
the
renegotiation
board
must
follow
the
freedom
of
information
act.
that
seems
like
a
very
reasonable
and
plausible
proposition.
and
the
court
below
found
that
the
renegotiation
board
was
not
following
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
the
simple
question
is,
should
they
be
allowed
to
proceed
with
renegotiation?
now
as
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
precisely,
if
the
court
please,
your
honor.
it’s
correct.
there’s
plenty
of
relief
in
the
freedom
of
information
act,
however,
there’s
nothing
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
says
that
the
court
does
not
have
a
general
equity
of
power
to
consider
whether
the
renegotiations
that
stayed
for
a
short
period
of
time,
the
renegotiation
process,
but
it
seems
clear
on
the
face
of
it
and
i
submit
on
the
face
of
the
regulations
now
that
it’s
abundantly
clear
that
they
are
ignoring
the
responsibility
under
the
other
act.
this
is
just
a
traditional
exercise
of
the
equity
power
where
--
i
think
we
established
the
irreparable
injury
can
accrue
by
virtue
of
the
boards’
refusal
to
follow
the
statute.
the
board
has
been
told
in
numerous
cases
that
they
must
follow
the
statute.
there
are
several
federal
court
decisions
and
appellate
court
decisions
instructing
the
board
to
follow
the
statute
and
now
they
have
done
so
in
their
regulations.
we
do
not
suggest
that
there’s
any
authority
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
grant
this
type
of
an
injunction
but
we
say
that
when
a
failure
of
an
agency
to
follow
its
own
regulation
or
follow
a
statute
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
court
does
have
general
equity
power
which
can
be
exercised
only
in
very
limited
circumstances.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
as
this
court
has
held,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
held
repeatedly
where
there
is
judicial
review
of
the
agency
process,
the
court
should
not
entertain
interlocutory
appeals
except
in
very
rare
special
circumstances.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
the
nlrb
cases,
the
other
agency
cases
where
there’s
statutory
review,
there
you
get
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
a
denial
of
due
process
or
denial
of
procedural
or
substantive
errors.
we
don’t
get
that
here.
a
counsel
said
in
response
to
you
in
response
to
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
if
we
agree
with
the
first
level
of
renegotiation,
is
the
government
bound?
they
are
not
bound.
the
statutory
board,
can
at
any
time,
and
they
have
done
this
to
me
on
more
than
one
occasion,
set
aside
an
agreement
with
the
regional
board
reached
after
a
conference
with
the
renegotiator
and
assign
the
case
to
itself
and
go
through
the
entire
process
all
over
again.
and
understanding
--
we
get
no
understanding
of
what
the
board
is
doing
until
after
the
fact.
let
me
try
to
explain.
we
have
a
meeting
with
the
regional
board.
the
regional
board
writes
us
a
letter
and
it’s
shown
in
the
exhibits
to
our
complaint
to
ask
bannercraft
$1,400,000.00.
we
then
asked
summary
of
facts
and
reasons.
it
was
after
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
their
reasons
and
we
could
take
it
or
leave
it.
it
is
after
they
have
made
their
judgments.
then
we
go
to
the
statutory
board
and
the
same
procedure
obtains.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
they
absolutely
have
that
authority
and
they
have
done
it.
i
have
a
hearing
coming
up
in
november
before
the
board
following
an
agreement
with
the
regional
board.
yes,
sir.
the
statutory
board
has
that
authority
in
their
regulations.
they
can
reassign
the
case
to
itself
at
any
time.
after
the
statutory
board
makes
its
determination
then
you
get,
it's
on
request,
a
statement
of
the
reasons
for
the
statutory
board
action.
but
there’s
no
further
negotiation.
you
would
have
paid
it
or
you
don’t.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
summary
where
the
regional
board
told
us
that
we
have
been
compared
with
other
contractors
as
they
are
required
to
in
their
own
regulations
and
where
they
said
that
their
procurement
information
indicated
a
lack
of
adequate
competition
that
we
wrote
and
asked
for
these
documents.
we
wanted
to
get
the
documents
that
supported
the
contentions
of
the
regional
board.
for
example,
in
1967,
bannercraft
performed
four
contracts,
two
primes
and
two
subs.
we
took
the
subcontracts
on
the
same
price
or
less
than
the
prime.
now,
if
the
board
did
not
renegotiate
the
prime,
but
renegotiated
us
on
the
same
price,
they
were
being
penalized
for
efficiency.
we
have
a
right
to
examine
that.
and
now,
i
think
the
board
will
give
us
that
information.
i
sincerely
believe
under
their
regulations,
they
would
give
us
that
information.
maybe
they
don't
want
to
apply
these
regulations
retroactively
but
when
they
tell
us
we’ve
been
compared
with
other
contractors,
and
refused
to
tell
us
who
they
are.
when
they
say
that
procurement
information,
procurement
documents
indicated
lack
of
adequate
competition
and
refused
to
give
us
the
procurement
documents,
there’s
not
much
that
we
can
do
by
way
of
renegotiation
except
to
say,
“look,
we
still
think
we
are
efficient.
and
we
still
think
that
if
you
will
compare
us
with
this
primes
under
whom
we
perform
subcontracts,
we
can
establish
that.
that’s
really
what
we
asked
for”
now,
how
long
should
the
stay
be
in
this
case?
there
need
not
be
extensive
delay
in
a
case
like
this.
in
the
first
place,
with
the
change
in
regulations,
and
the
status
of
grumman
and
i
understand
the
status
of
grumman
to
be
this.
a
petition
for
rehearing
by
the
government
was
denied
the
mandate
has
issued,
i
thought
it
was
final.
late
yesterday
afternoon,
i
heard
by
telephone
that
the
government
had
filed
a
motion
to
recall
the
mandate.
now,
whatever
degree
of
finality
that
takes
away
from
the
case
that
is
its
present
posture.
the
case
will
never
rise
again
even
under
the
renegotiation
board.
and
this
case
can
never
rise
with
an
agency
that
has
statutory
judicial
review.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
in
this
case,
your
honor,
yes.
but
the
rules
have
been
clarified
now.
we
have
several
decisions
relating
to
the
renegotiation
board
and
the
board
has
recognized
the
ease
in
their
regulations.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
doubt.
i
doubt
that
any
district
court.
and
as
what
we’ve
shown
in
our
brief,
the
district
courts
have
not
entered
injunctions
automatically.
they
have
denied
injunctions
in
similar
circumstances
depending
upon
the
board’s
response
to
the
act.
a
district
court
is
unlikely
to
grant
an
injunction
where
the
distinction
is
on
two
or
three
documents
as
against
the
broad
denial.
understand
what
the
board
gave
me
and
charged
me
for
was
a
stack
of
documents.
with
everything
blanked
out
which
i
think
we’ve
said
on
our
brief
which
are
just
mimeographed
forms
of
the
board
and
then
they
move
to
dissolve
their
injunction
that
went
before
a
different
judge
who
looked
at
the
documents
and
denied
the
motion
to
dissolve.
two
judges
examined
the
bannercraft
documents
plus
the
court
of
appeals
but
they
found
that
it
was
an
absolute
total
refusal
to
comply.
a
minor
dispute
over
one
document
or
two
documents
would
not
result
in
a
district
court
entering
this
type
of
an
injunction,
i
am
sure.
and
certainly
it
would
not
apply
on
the
rule
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
any
agency
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
of
general
wide
importance
i
think
there’s
very
little.
for
this
contractor,
it’s
extremely
important
because
before
we
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
a
final
order
is
entered.
we
must
post
a
bond
equal
to
100%.
it’s
almost
like
a
judgment.
it’s
immediately
collectible,
if
the
court
please.
the
final
order
is
not
the
result
of
a
breakdown
in
negotiations.
it
has
the
effect
of
a
final
judgment
of
a
court.
we
must
post
a
bond
of
100%
of
the
amount
of
the
determination
in
government
bonds
with
the
court
of
claims
to
prevent
collection.
so
at
each
step
of
the
agency
process
and
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
demand
can
be
raised
or
lowered.
therefore,
if
we
don’t
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
negotiate
with
the
board
and
reach
agreement,
we
go
to
the
court
of
claims
fully
informed,
we
run
the
risk
of
having
that
$1,400,000.00
go
to
a
$1,700,000.00.
we
don’t
have
opportunity
to
make
a
fair
judgment.
but
this
is
not
an
earth-shaking
case.
this
is
not
a
case
of
even
any
great
presidential
value
in
my
judgment.
because
it
would
only
apply
to
agencies
like
the
board
and
i’m
not
sure
that
there
are
very
many
that
don’t
have
statutory
review.
and
secondly,
it
probably
will
come
up
with
the
board.
i
do
want
to
make
one
quick
reference
to
aircraft
and
diesel
equipment
corporation
which
the
counsel
has
raised.
that
case
in
my
judgment
affirmed
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
issue
an
injunction.
because
what
the
court
said
was,
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
in
equity
and
since
the
appellant
had
a
complete
remedy
at
law.
and
the
complete
remedy
of
law
that
this
court
was
talking
about
was
this,
aircraft
was
a
subcontractor.
its
prime
contractors
were
withholding
money
from
aircraft
at
the
direction
of
the
government
based
upon
a
renegotiation
claim.
this
court
said
to
aircraft,
“sue
your
prime
contractor.
your
prime
contractor
hold
and
we
know
of
no
reason
why
all
of
the
issues
that
you
raised
before
this
court
could
not
be
raised
in
litigation
with
your
prime
contractor.”
and
this
court
would
not
have
go
into
the
light
of
saying
that
you
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
if
they
didn’t
recognize
the
inherent
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
under
limited
circumstances
issue
a
very
temporary
stay.
and
i
emphasize,
if
the
board
had
gone
back
and
complied
with
grumman.
if
the
court
please,
the
first
grumman
decision
had
been
entered
before
this
preliminary
injunction
was
held.
the
board
didn’t
seek
cert
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
it
conceivably
could
but
that’s
always
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
the
court
can
always
say
that
the
plaintiff
is
not
proceeding
diligently
and
therefore
dissolve
the
injunction
and
that
is
an
inherent
power
of
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
courts
do
not
necessarily
have
to
entertain
delay.
the
freedom
of
information
act
cases
get
priority
on
every
calendar
by
the
act
itself.
and
if
they
feel
that
the
plaintiff
is
delaying,
that
court
has
inherent
power
to
dissolve
the
injunction.
but
i
am
suggesting
that
if
the
board
complies
with
its
own
regulations,
these
cases
will
not
arise.
i
can’t
conceive
of
a
district
court
granting
this
type
of
an
injunction
if
there’s
substantial
compliance.
here,
your
honor,
there
was
no
compliance.
and
i
think
that
is
clearly
the
distinction.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
would
disagree
with
that
a
little
bit,
your
honor
and
–-
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
they
did,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
didn’t
say
it
was
moot.
i
said,
if
they
comply
with
their
own
regulations
as
with
grumman,
it
might
be
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
no,
i
say,
if
once
they
comply
with
the
freedom
of
information
act,
the
very
basis
for
the
injunction
disappear,
the
injunction
would
be
dissolved.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
quarrel
with
that.
there’s
not
any
quarrel
with
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
don’t
think
they
would
have
to
be
set
aside
if
the
injunction
was
--
the
question
here
on
jurisdiction
critically
the
district
court
had
equitable
authority
into
this
injunction.
it
only
applies
to
an
agency,
which
does
not
otherwise
have
statutory
review.
this
is
a
very
peculiar
agency.
most
agencies
do
have
statutory
judicial
review.
it
would
not
apply
to
any
of
those
agencies
and
these
decisions
of
this
court
and
consistent
in
line
of
cases
of
the
federal
court.
so,
it’s
a
peculiar
type
of
agency,
number
one.
number
two,
there
was
a
flat
defiant
refusal
to
comply
with
any
portion
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
by
the
board.
and
i
am
sure
this
had
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
district
court
judge.
his
equitable
authority,
i
think,
is
confirmed
by
aircraft
and
diesel.
we
did
not
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
here.
the
final
action
of
the
board
does
have
severe
consequences
to
a
contractor
and
should
we
let
the
agency
completely
refuse
to
comply
with
the
public
policy
of
the
congress
and
yet
go
ahead
with
renegotiation,
which
has
severe
penalties
for
the
contractor.
the
district
court
said
no.
the
court
of
appeals
said
no.
i
must
say
that
on
the
equities
of
this
case,
i
think
that
it’s
examined
carefully
i
think
this
court
will
agree
that
in
this
case
and
on
its
peculiar
facts,
on
the
complete
defiant
refusal
of
the
board
to
make
any
real
pretext
to
compliance
with
this
important
public
policy,
the
district
court’s
judgment
was
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
was
waiting
for
the
light.
forgive
me,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i’m
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
at
the
onset
note
sharp
disagreement
with
a
couple
of
statements
of
government
counsel.
first,
the
regulations
of
the
board
as
they
were
amended
last
november
--
november
197,
in
fact
provide
that
from
now
on,
a
contractor
on
request
will
get
all
of
the
information,
i
believe
that
bannercraft
asked
for
and
most
of
the
information
that
the
other
contractors
asked
for.
for
example
in
32
cfr
section
1472.7,
the
regulations
of
the
board
now
provide
that
a
contractor
may
have
on
request
the
performance
information.
that
is
the
performance
evaluation
of
other
agencies
of
government.
or
in
the
case
of
a
subcontractor-prime
contractor
relationship,
the
performance
information
provided
by
prime
contractor
on
the
level
of
performance
of
the
subcontractor.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
don’t
know,
your
honor.
i
think
the
board
–-
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
did?
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
assuming
that
the
board
complies
fully
with
their
own
regulations,
and
with
the
further
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
grumman
aircraft
this
summer,
i
think
there’s
nothing
left
of
this
case.
if
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
grumman
decided
in
july
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
yes,
sir.
the
new
regulation,
yes,
as
implemented
by
grumman.
the
grumman
decision
simply
says,
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
grumman
is
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
which
only
relates
to
one
portion.
i
might
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
section
1418.5
of
the
regulations.
there
are
15
categories
of
documents
that
are
now
made
available
by
the
renegotiation
board.
they
were
not
made
available
when
we
first
filed
this
lawsuit.
they
do
include
agreements
determining
excessive
profits,
orders
determining
the
excessive
profits,
statement
of
facts
and
the
reasons
issued
by
the
board
and
so
on.
now,
at
the
bottom
of
that
section
it
says
this
–-
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
we
are
not
going
back
to
seek
them
and
the
board
has
not
made
them
available.
we
have
exhausted
our
remedies
if
the
court
please.
we
have
no
remedy
left
at
the
board
level.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
no,
sir.
we
filed
our
request
for
information
to
the
secretary;
that
was
denied.
we
went
to
the
board.
the
board
denied
our
final
request.
there’s
no
time
period
that
i
know
of
within
which
we
could
go
back
and
ask
for
reconsideration.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
i
think
this
is
a
change
in
the
regulation
in
our
favor
but
it
was
just
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
i
am
not
sure
of
the
board’s
point
of
view,
your
honor.
but
i
would
assume
that
if
the
board
wanted
to,
they
could
have
then
communicated.
they
gave
us
some
documents
which
were
worthless
that
the
district
courts
have
found.
they
could
have
simply
responded
further
to
our
request
which
was
pending
before
the
board
and
said
we
are
going
to
make
available,
these
documents,
we
may
or
may
not
have
an
issue
of
that
before
the
district
court.
if
we
had
one,
it
would
have
been
very
narrow.
i
submit
because
the
only
issue
left,
really,
is
the
issue
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
grumman.
now
if
the
board
--
of
course,
i
cannot
predict
how
the
board
is
going
to
apply
these
regulations.
but
i
assume
if
the
board
complied
with
the
spared
--
other
regulations
is
implemented
by
grumman
that
we
would
have
very
little
remaining
an
issue.
these
documents
are
not
only
available
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
but
they
are
critically
important
to
the
conduct
of
renegotiation,
and
there
again
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well
–-
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
the
freedom
of
information
act,
if
the
court
please,
i
submit
is
an
important
national
policy
which
should
be
read
in
conjunction
with
all
existing
statutes
and
it’s
clearly
applicable
to
the
renegotiation
board.
there’s
no
argument
there
and
the
renegotiation
board
should
not
be
permitted
to
ignore
its
responsibilities
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
continue
with
renegotiation
because
the
importance
of
these
documents
comes
down
to
this.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
no,
your
honor.
well,
there’s
only
one
group
that
i
know
of,
not
our
clients.
but
only
one
group
that
i
know
of
and
that’s
the
group
of
georgetown
students.
their
request
resulted
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
fisher
versus
renegotiation
board.
but
it's
unlikely,
that
any
public
interest
group
would
request
documents
from
the
board
except
maybe
a
group
of
law
students
or
an
effective
contractor.
i
think
in
some
sense,
we
in
there
not
only
on
our
own
behalf
but
on
the
concept
of
a
private
attorney
general.
we
are
suggesting
that
the
renegotiation
board
must
follow
the
freedom
of
information
act.
that
seems
like
a
very
reasonable
and
plausible
proposition.
and
the
court
below
found
that
the
renegotiation
board
was
not
following
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
the
simple
question
is,
should
they
be
allowed
to
proceed
with
renegotiation?
now
as
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
well,
precisely,
if
the
court
please,
your
honor.
it’s
correct.
there’s
plenty
of
relief
in
the
freedom
of
information
act,
however,
there’s
nothing
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
says
that
the
court
does
not
have
a
general
equity
of
power
to
consider
whether
the
renegotiations
that
stayed
for
a
short
period
of
time,
the
renegotiation
process,
but
it
seems
clear
on
the
face
of
it
and
i
submit
on
the
face
of
the
regulations
now
that
it’s
abundantly
clear
that
they
are
ignoring
the
responsibility
under
the
other
act.
this
is
just
a
traditional
exercise
of
the
equity
power
where
--
i
think
we
established
the
irreparable
injury
can
accrue
by
virtue
of
the
boards’
refusal
to
follow
the
statute.
the
board
has
been
told
in
numerous
cases
that
they
must
follow
the
statute.
there
are
several
federal
court
decisions
and
appellate
court
decisions
instructing
the
board
to
follow
the
statute
and
now
they
have
done
so
in
their
regulations.
we
do
not
suggest
that
there’s
any
authority
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
grant
this
type
of
an
injunction
but
we
say
that
when
a
failure
of
an
agency
to
follow
its
own
regulation
or
follow
a
statute
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
court
does
have
general
equity
power
which
can
be
exercised
only
in
very
limited
circumstances.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
as
this
court
has
held,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
held
repeatedly
where
there
is
judicial
review
of
the
agency
process,
the
court
should
not
entertain
interlocutory
appeals
except
in
very
rare
special
circumstances.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
the
nlrb
cases,
the
other
agency
cases
where
there’s
statutory
review,
there
you
get
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
a
denial
of
due
process
or
denial
of
procedural
or
substantive
errors.
we
don’t
get
that
here.
a
counsel
said
in
response
to
you
in
response
to
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
if
we
agree
with
the
first
level
of
renegotiation,
is
the
government
bound?
they
are
not
bound.
the
statutory
board,
can
at
any
time,
and
they
have
done
this
to
me
on
more
than
one
occasion,
set
aside
an
agreement
with
the
regional
board
reached
after
a
conference
with
the
renegotiator
and
assign
the
case
to
itself
and
go
through
the
entire
process
all
over
again.
and
understanding
--
we
get
no
understanding
of
what
the
board
is
doing
until
after
the
fact.
let
me
try
to
explain.
we
have
a
meeting
with
the
regional
board.
the
regional
board
writes
us
a
letter
and
it’s
shown
in
the
exhibits
to
our
complaint
to
ask
bannercraft
$1,400,000.00.
we
then
asked
summary
of
facts
and
reasons.
it
was
after
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
their
reasons
and
we
could
take
it
or
leave
it.
it
is
after
they
have
made
their
judgments.
then
we
go
to
the
statutory
board
and
the
same
procedure
obtains.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
they
absolutely
have
that
authority
and
they
have
done
it.
i
have
a
hearing
coming
up
in
november
before
the
board
following
an
agreement
with
the
regional
board.
yes,
sir.
the
statutory
board
has
that
authority
in
their
regulations.
they
can
reassign
the
case
to
itself
at
any
time.
after
the
statutory
board
makes
its
determination
then
you
get,
it's
on
request,
a
statement
of
the
reasons
for
the
statutory
board
action.
but
there’s
no
further
negotiation.
you
would
have
paid
it
or
you
don’t.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
summary
where
the
regional
board
told
us
that
we
have
been
compared
with
other
contractors
as
they
are
required
to
in
their
own
regulations
and
where
they
said
that
their
procurement
information
indicated
a
lack
of
adequate
competition
that
we
wrote
and
asked
for
these
documents.
we
wanted
to
get
the
documents
that
supported
the
contentions
of
the
regional
board.
for
example,
in
1967,
bannercraft
performed
four
contracts,
two
primes
and
two
subs.
we
took
the
subcontracts
on
the
same
price
or
less
than
the
prime.
now,
if
the
board
did
not
renegotiate
the
prime,
but
renegotiated
us
on
the
same
price,
they
were
being
penalized
for
efficiency.
we
have
a
right
to
examine
that.
and
now,
i
think
the
board
will
give
us
that
information.
i
sincerely
believe
under
their
regulations,
they
would
give
us
that
information.
maybe
they
don't
want
to
apply
these
regulations
retroactively
but
when
they
tell
us
we’ve
been
compared
with
other
contractors,
and
refused
to
tell
us
who
they
are.
when
they
say
that
procurement
information,
procurement
documents
indicated
lack
of
adequate
competition
and
refused
to
give
us
the
procurement
documents,
there’s
not
much
that
we
can
do
by
way
of
renegotiation
except
to
say,
“look,
we
still
think
we
are
efficient.
and
we
still
think
that
if
you
will
compare
us
with
this
primes
under
whom
we
perform
subcontracts,
we
can
establish
that.
that’s
really
what
we
asked
for”
now,
how
long
should
the
stay
be
in
this
case?
there
need
not
be
extensive
delay
in
a
case
like
this.
in
the
first
place,
with
the
change
in
regulations,
and
the
status
of
grumman
and
i
understand
the
status
of
grumman
to
be
this.
a
petition
for
rehearing
by
the
government
was
denied
the
mandate
has
issued,
i
thought
it
was
final.
late
yesterday
afternoon,
i
heard
by
telephone
that
the
government
had
filed
a
motion
to
recall
the
mandate.
now,
whatever
degree
of
finality
that
takes
away
from
the
case
that
is
its
present
posture.
the
case
will
never
rise
again
even
under
the
renegotiation
board.
and
this
case
can
never
rise
with
an
agency
that
has
statutory
judicial
review.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
in
this
case,
your
honor,
yes.
but
the
rules
have
been
clarified
now.
we
have
several
decisions
relating
to
the
renegotiation
board
and
the
board
has
recognized
the
ease
in
their
regulations.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
doubt.
i
doubt
that
any
district
court.
and
as
what
we’ve
shown
in
our
brief,
the
district
courts
have
not
entered
injunctions
automatically.
they
have
denied
injunctions
in
similar
circumstances
depending
upon
the
board’s
response
to
the
act.
a
district
court
is
unlikely
to
grant
an
injunction
where
the
distinction
is
on
two
or
three
documents
as
against
the
broad
denial.
understand
what
the
board
gave
me
and
charged
me
for
was
a
stack
of
documents.
with
everything
blanked
out
which
i
think
we’ve
said
on
our
brief
which
are
just
mimeographed
forms
of
the
board
and
then
they
move
to
dissolve
their
injunction
that
went
before
a
different
judge
who
looked
at
the
documents
and
denied
the
motion
to
dissolve.
two
judges
examined
the
bannercraft
documents
plus
the
court
of
appeals
but
they
found
that
it
was
an
absolute
total
refusal
to
comply.
a
minor
dispute
over
one
document
or
two
documents
would
not
result
in
a
district
court
entering
this
type
of
an
injunction,
i
am
sure.
and
certainly
it
would
not
apply
on
the
rule
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
any
agency
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
of
general
wide
importance
i
think
there’s
very
little.
for
this
contractor,
it’s
extremely
important
because
before
we
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
a
final
order
is
entered.
we
must
post
a
bond
equal
to
100%.
it’s
almost
like
a
judgment.
it’s
immediately
collectible,
if
the
court
please.
the
final
order
is
not
the
result
of
a
breakdown
in
negotiations.
it
has
the
effect
of
a
final
judgment
of
a
court.
we
must
post
a
bond
of
100%
of
the
amount
of
the
determination
in
government
bonds
with
the
court
of
claims
to
prevent
collection.
so
at
each
step
of
the
agency
process
and
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
demand
can
be
raised
or
lowered.
therefore,
if
we
don’t
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
negotiate
with
the
board
and
reach
agreement,
we
go
to
the
court
of
claims
fully
informed,
we
run
the
risk
of
having
that
$1,400,000.00
go
to
a
$1,700,000.00.
we
don’t
have
opportunity
to
make
a
fair
judgment.
but
this
is
not
an
earth-shaking
case.
this
is
not
a
case
of
even
any
great
presidential
value
in
my
judgment.
because
it
would
only
apply
to
agencies
like
the
board
and
i’m
not
sure
that
there
are
very
many
that
don’t
have
statutory
review.
and
secondly,
it
probably
will
come
up
with
the
board.
i
do
want
to
make
one
quick
reference
to
aircraft
and
diesel
equipment
corporation
which
the
counsel
has
raised.
that
case
in
my
judgment
affirmed
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
issue
an
injunction.
because
what
the
court
said
was,
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
in
equity
and
since
the
appellant
had
a
complete
remedy
at
law.
and
the
complete
remedy
of
law
that
this
court
was
talking
about
was
this,
aircraft
was
a
subcontractor.
its
prime
contractors
were
withholding
money
from
aircraft
at
the
direction
of
the
government
based
upon
a
renegotiation
claim.
this
court
said
to
aircraft,
“sue
your
prime
contractor.
your
prime
contractor
hold
and
we
know
of
no
reason
why
all
of
the
issues
that
you
raised
before
this
court
could
not
be
raised
in
litigation
with
your
prime
contractor.”
and
this
court
would
not
have
go
into
the
light
of
saying
that
you
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
if
they
didn’t
recognize
the
inherent
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
under
limited
circumstances
issue
a
very
temporary
stay.
and
i
emphasize,
if
the
board
had
gone
back
and
complied
with
grumman.
if
the
court
please,
the
first
grumman
decision
had
been
entered
before
this
preliminary
injunction
was
held.
the
board
didn’t
seek
cert
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
it
conceivably
could
but
that’s
always
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
the
court
can
always
say
that
the
plaintiff
is
not
proceeding
diligently
and
therefore
dissolve
the
injunction
and
that
is
an
inherent
power
of
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
courts
do
not
necessarily
have
to
entertain
delay.
the
freedom
of
information
act
cases
get
priority
on
every
calendar
by
the
act
itself.
and
if
they
feel
that
the
plaintiff
is
delaying,
that
court
has
inherent
power
to
dissolve
the
injunction.
but
i
am
suggesting
that
if
the
board
complies
with
its
own
regulations,
these
cases
will
not
arise.
i
can’t
conceive
of
a
district
court
granting
this
type
of
an
injunction
if
there’s
substantial
compliance.
here,
your
honor,
there
was
no
compliance.
and
i
think
that
is
clearly
the
distinction.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
would
disagree
with
that
a
little
bit,
your
honor
and
–-
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
they
did,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
didn’t
say
it
was
moot.
i
said,
if
they
comply
with
their
own
regulations
as
with
grumman,
it
might
be
--
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
no,
i
say,
if
once
they
comply
with
the
freedom
of
information
act,
the
very
basis
for
the
injunction
disappear,
the
injunction
would
be
dissolved.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
quarrel
with
that.
there’s
not
any
quarrel
with
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
don’t
think
they
would
have
to
be
set
aside
if
the
injunction
was
--
the
question
here
on
jurisdiction
critically
the
district
court
had
equitable
authority
into
this
injunction.
it
only
applies
to
an
agency,
which
does
not
otherwise
have
statutory
review.
this
is
a
very
peculiar
agency.
most
agencies
do
have
statutory
judicial
review.
it
would
not
apply
to
any
of
those
agencies
and
these
decisions
of
this
court
and
consistent
in
line
of
cases
of
the
federal
court.
so,
it’s
a
peculiar
type
of
agency,
number
one.
number
two,
there
was
a
flat
defiant
refusal
to
comply
with
any
portion
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
by
the
board.
and
i
am
sure
this
had
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
district
court
judge.
his
equitable
authority,
i
think,
is
confirmed
by
aircraft
and
diesel.
we
did
not
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
here.
the
final
action
of
the
board
does
have
severe
consequences
to
a
contractor
and
should
we
let
the
agency
completely
refuse
to
comply
with
the
public
policy
of
the
congress
and
yet
go
ahead
with
renegotiation,
which
has
severe
penalties
for
the
contractor.
the
district
court
said
no.
the
court
of
appeals
said
no.
i
must
say
that
on
the
equities
of
this
case,
i
think
that
it’s
examined
carefully
i
think
this
court
will
agree
that
in
this
case
and
on
its
peculiar
facts,
on
the
complete
defiant
refusal
of
the
board
to
make
any
real
pretext
to
compliance
with
this
important
public
policy,
the
district
court’s
judgment
was
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i
was
waiting
for
the
light.
forgive
me,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
ackerly
i’m
sorry.
