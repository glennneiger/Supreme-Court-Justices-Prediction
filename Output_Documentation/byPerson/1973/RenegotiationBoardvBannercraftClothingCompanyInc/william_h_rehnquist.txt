justice

mr.
ackerly,
the
freedom
of
information
act
gives
you
plenty
of
remedy
as
a
private
attorney
general
or
as
a
citizen.
i
mean,
going
to
district
court
and
make
the
board
comply
with
the
freedom
of
information
act.
that
is
not
a
reason
by
itself
to
go
for
stating
the
administrative
proceedings,
i
would
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
say
that
even
if
you
decided
to
pay
over
the
$1,400,000.00
they
asked
you
for,
the
statutory
board
might
still
have
transferred
the
case
to
itself
and
imposed
a
higher
amount?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
case,
say
with
the
renegotiation
board
where
you
obtain
an
injunction
of
the
renegotiation
proceedings
and
you
fight
out
your
freedom
of
information
act
case
in
the
district
court
then
that
is
appealed
by
the
losing
party
of
the
court
of
appeals.
certainly,
you
are
looking
at
a
year
or
two
in
that
process,
aren’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
presumably
this
is
the
principle
of
some
general
application
and
it
isn’t
completely
foreclosed
that
somebody
will
get
into
dispute
with
the
board
in
the
future
about
some
fine
point
of
their
regulation
and
then
you
will
have
to
litigate
the
freedom
of
information
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
say
a
temporary
stay
though
mr.
ackerly,
you
are
talking
about
whatever
time
it
takes
to
resolve
the
freedom
of
information
act
issue.
whether
that
can
be
done
by
simply
the
use
of
already
established
precedence
or
whether
it
may
take
another
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
this
took
away
the
discretionary
right
of
the
agency
to
deny
under
the
old
act
and
then
they
made
it
available
to
citizens
unless
the
agency
could
meet
its
burden
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i’m
talking
about
the
particular
section
of
the
legislative
history
you
just
read
about
from
the
report
on
the
bill
that
wasn’t
passed.
is
that
still
your
answer
to
the
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
freedom
of
information
act
would
give
you
anything
more
than
what
you
would
get
under
discovery
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
william

that
you
won’t
