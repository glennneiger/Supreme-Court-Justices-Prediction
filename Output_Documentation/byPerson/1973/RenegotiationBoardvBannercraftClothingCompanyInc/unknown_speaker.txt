unknown
speaker
and
were
they
used
to
be
approximate?
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
work
product
for
anything?
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
be
adequate
anything
they
are
privileged?
unknown
speaker
well,
mrs.
shapiro,
then
i
think
the
only
real
issue
here
whether
this
sort
of
thing
has
to
wait
until
it
gets
to
the
court
of
claims
before
they
are
entitled
to
these
documents?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
if,
it
is
all
what
we
are
talking
about
substantially
is,
they
can
not
have
this
kind
of
discovery
at
this
stage.
however,
they
can
back
in,
its
like
if
they
have
any
discovery
they
have
to
wait
until
the
case,
if
it
does,
gets
to
the
court
of
claims?
unknown
speaker
that’s
really
what
it’s
all
about.
well,
either
i’m
not
sure
that
you
would
say
they
could
have
the
remedies
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
if
they
say
yes,
the
administrative
proceeding
has
to
go
on.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
shapiro,
what
in
your
estimation
are
these
particular
contractors
seeking
here,
is
it
information
as
to
comparative
costs
with
respect
to
competitors
or
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
certainly
is
a
broader
request
than
under
the
practice
prevailing
before
the
freedom
of
information
act?
certainly,
all
of
the
post-world
war
ii,
immediately
post
-
world
war
ii
renegotiations,
is
this
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can’t
describe
them
anymore
definitively
than
in
these
broad
terms?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
may
i
interrupt
just
once
more.
i
noticed
in
your
footnote
6,
page
5
of
the
board’s
brief
this
gets
back
to
my
brother
blackmun’s
question
that
astro
asked
copies
of
the
recommendations
contained
in
the
renegotiation
report
prepared
by
the
staff.
all
records,
analysis,
determinations,
opinions,
reports
or
summaries
bearing
upon
the
renegotiation
of
its
profits
that
bannercraft
along
with
all
communications
between
government
agencies
regarding
bannercraft’s
performance
of
its
contacts
and
disposition
of
renegotiation
proceedings.
lilly
sought
the
recommendations
contained
in
the
report,
material
supplied
by
other
government
agencies
and
all
intra-agency
memoranda
and
written
communications
consisting
of
recommendations
and/or
analyses
prepared
by
the
personnel
or
members
of
the
board.
that’s
quite
everything,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
got
into
the
discovery
proceedings
in
the
court
of
claims,
as
the
case
got
there,
might
that
–-
as
much
i
have
trouble
on
the
breadth
of
that
as
a
matter
of
discovery?
unknown
speaker
those
regulations
just
apply
to
future
cases
or
yours
too?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
just
assume
that
the
regulations
did
apply
to
your
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
that
you
could
get
all
of
this
information
that
you
wanted,
right
now,with
respect
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what’s
grumman
got
to
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
your
point
was
that
there
are
new
regulations
which
give
you
everything
you
want?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
haven’t
got
much
of
the
point
based
on
the
regulations
in
it
because
i
suppose
grumman
is
just
a
court
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
have
you
gone
back
and
sought
these
materials
you
want
on
these
new
regulations?
unknown
speaker
not
even
under
their
new
regulations?
unknown
speaker
you
normally
would,
i
suppose
because
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
regulation
in
your
favor?
unknown
speaker
if
it
falls
generally
in
the
area
of
the
procedural
regulation,
which
this
does,
normally
the
new
procedures
apply
to
pending
cases?
unknown
speaker
why
can
you
say
that
when
your
renegotiator
did
not
have
them
in
1950?
and
that
renegotiation
seems
to
me
went
off
pretty
successfully?
unknown
speaker
at
least
we
thought
that
did
–-
unknown
speaker
have
any
of
your
clients
pursued
relief
as
a
member
of
the
general
public
as
distinguished
from
a
contractor
in
renegotiation?
unknown
speaker
exactly,
what
in
the
way
of
the
principle
of
general
wide
importance
is
now
involved
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
new
regulations?
unknown
speaker
but
the
fact
remains
that
what
was
decided
below
was
an
important
matter
that
you
can
enjoin
an
administrative
agency
while
you,
as
a
way
of
enforcing
freedom
of
information
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
did
enjoin
it,
didn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
and
as
the
government’s
argument
here
is
that
they
could
not
have
--
they
should
not
have
done
it.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
say,
there’s
nothing
left
to
this
case,
if
you
in
effect
say
it
is
moot.
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
they
do
comply
with
the
--
if
you
went
back
and
ask
them
they
would
comply
with
their
own
regulations
and
with
grumman
and
you
could
get
what
you
wanted,
would
there
be
anything
left
to
the
case?
and
if
they
worked,
you
would
say
that
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
would
be
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
set
aside?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
just
said
it
was?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
must
say
that
you
wouldn’t
ask
--
you
certainly
wouldn’t
ask
for
an
injunction
against
an
agency
proceeding
in
order
to
get
a
document
that
was
not
relevant,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
in
this
language
that
these
three
reports,
shows
a
legislative
purpose
to
do
what?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the
renegotiation
board
wrote
into
its
rules
of
procedure
if
it
has
some,
so
i
take
it
was,
letting
those
rules
of
procedures
that
very
terms
of
the
renegotiation
or
of
that
of
the
freedom
of
information
act?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
let’s
assume
it
is
and
then
you
demanded
something
under
paragraph
so
and
so
of
these
rules
and
it
was
refused.
now,
normally,
what
is
your
remedy
when
you
lose
on
an
effort
to
make
a
discovery?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
hypothesize
at
all.
i
just
say
that
you
claim
that
it
has.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
not
violated
the
rules.
the
question
is
whether
normally,
a
discovery
dispute
--
whether
the
main
proceeding
may
be
held
up
while
you
settled
that
discovery
dispute,
in
some
other
form?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
shapiro,
do
you
agree
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
is
implicitly
part
of
the
discovery
rules
of
the
renegotiation
board?
unknown
speaker
if
in
the
course
of
a
proceeding,
you
demand
from
the
board
in
connection
of
this
particular
litigation,
certain
documents
covered
by
the
freedom
of
information
act
which
you
allege
are
relevant
to
the
proceedings.
would
you
think
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
that
extent
is
part
of
the
discovery
rule?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
question
is
whether
if
you
have
a
dispute
over
discovery
the
proceeding
must
be
hold
until
you
settle
it?
unknown
speaker
it
really
doesn’t
have
to
be
put
in
the
context
of
what
the
freedom
of
information
act
intended?
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
it
did
not,
it
may
be
that
the
normal
rules
of
how
to
settle
a
discovery
dispute
might
mean
that
you
lose
the
case.
namely,
what
if
the
rule
were
that
you
do
enjoin
the
main
proceeding
while
you
settle
the
discovery
dispute,
wholly
aside
from
the
freedom
of
information
act,
you
might
be
in
trouble
here.
unknown
speaker
for
example,
what
if
the
plaintiff
here
brought
a
mandamus
action
in
the
federal
court
saying
that
the
official
of
the
renegotiation
board
had
flatly
refused
to
do
his
duty
under
his
own
discovery
rules,
which
included
the
freedom
of
information
act?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
were
they
used
to
be
approximate?
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
work
product
for
anything?
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
be
adequate
anything
they
