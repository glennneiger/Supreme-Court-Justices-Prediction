these
are
three
cases
that
come
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
they
raise
the
issue
of
the
effect
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
on
proceedings
already
pending
under
the
renegotiation
act
of
1951
as
amended.
more
particularly
they
concern
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
district
court
to
enjoin
the
renegotiation
process
until
an
foi
claim
is
resolved.
the
three
respondents,
all
possess
national
defense
contracts.
each
in
due
course
was
placed
in
renegotiation
and
as
to
each
the
regional
board
recommended
they
determination
of
the
existence
of
excessive
profits
each
contractor
then
made
a
demand
upon
the
board
for
certain
documents.
the
contractor
claimed
were
available
to
it
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
these
documents
in
general
related
to
operations
of
competitors.
in
any
event
when
the
request
was
denied
by
the
board,
the
contractor
instituted
a
suit
in
federal
district
court
to
enjoin
the
board
from
withholding
the
requested
documents
and
from
conducting
any
further
renegotiation
proceedings,
until
those
documents
were
produced
and
relief
was
granted
in
each
case.
on
appeal
all
three
decisions
were
affirmed
with
one
judge
dissenting.
specifically
the
court
held
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
administrative
proceedings
before
the
board.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
first
that
the
renegotiation
board
as
an
entity
is
not
exempt
from
applicable
provisions
of
foia.
second
that
the
principle
established
in
some
cases
of
a
statutorily
prescribed
special
and
exclusive
remedy
is
not
applicable
to
foia
cases.
third,
that
however
in
a
renegotiation
case,
the
contractor
is
oblige
to
pursue
it's
administrative
remedy
and
ultimately
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
and
when
it
fails
to
do
this
as
in
these
cases,
it
may
not
obtain
its
ends
through
the
route
of
judicial
interference
in
the
district
courts.
we
so
conclude
because
of
our
decision
were
otherwise,
the
effect
would
be
that
renegotiation
and
it's
aims
would
be
supplanted
and
defeated
by
an
foia
case
or
suit.
the
merits,
of
course,
are
not
before
us
at
this
time.
they
are
yet
to
be
decided
by
the
district
court.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
that
is
filed.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
powell.
