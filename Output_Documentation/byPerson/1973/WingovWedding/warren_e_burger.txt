chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
our
arguments
next
in
73-846
wingo
against
wedding.
mr.
ringo,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
rule
of
the
district
court
not
also
provide
that
either
party,
upon
request,
may
require
the
district
judge
to
hear
and
listen
to
the
transcript
of
the
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
have
said
but
if
you
did
i
missed
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
whether
there
are
any
full-time
magistrates
in
the
united
states
who
have
been
appointed
now
serving
who
are
not
lawyers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
a
district
judge
might
after
listening
to
the
reading
of
the
proposed
finding,
the
report
and
recommendations
and
listening
to
the
electronic
recording
might
then
decide
to
conduct
a
full-scale
hearing
himself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
ringo.
mr.
glass.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
do
you
think
section
(2)
of
the
statute
means,
“assistance
to
a
trial
judge
in
the
conduct
of
pretrial
or
discovery
proceedings
in
civil
or
criminal?”
do
you
think
that
would
embrace
a
pretrial
proceeding
for
the
suppression
of
evidence
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
criminal
matters,
what
pretrial
criminal
matters
do
you
think
section
(2),
subsection
(2)
covers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
many
pretrial
conferences
in
civil
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
criminal
cases,
i
mean
to
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
they
directors
of
the
suppression
type
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
this
not
advisory
when
the
report
is
subject
to
requiring
the
judge
to
listen
to
the
tape
recording?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
a
challenge
has
made
there,
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
prevents
the
judge
from
saying,
if
the
--
after
he
has
listened
to
the
tape
recording
that
i
think
there
are
serious
and
possibly
difficult
questions
of
credibility
here
and
so
will
set
this
down
for
a
hearing.
do
you
think
that’s
what
section
(3)
refers
a
district
judge
can
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
section
(3)
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
submission
of
the
language
which
i
am
referring
to
and
the
submission
of
a
report
and
recommendations
to
facilitate
the
decision
of
the
district
judge
having
jurisdiction
over
the
case
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
hearing.
now,
could
the
judge
not
been
sat
down
and
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
do
you
mean
the
judge
must
have
a
hearing
in
every
case
after
the
magistrate
has
had
a
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
submit
findings.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
not
all
the
cases
in
the
united
states
court
of
claims
cases
that
involve
many
millions
of
dollars,
tried
just
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
commissioner
who
makes
a
report
and
recommendations,
and
the
court
then
reviews
it
and
decides
to
accept
or
reject.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
carl
vinson
supposedly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
judge
fred
vinson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn’t
he
say
in
response
to
one
question
when
mr.
vinson
said,
he
assumed
that
he
did
not
intend
to
cover
some
of
these
things.
the
answer
was,
we
certainly
intend
that;
we
intend
to
lift
this
off
to
the
shoulders
of
the
judges
--
to
lift
off
this
to
the
shoulders
of
the
judges
as
much
of
the
routine
nature
of
discovery
or
fact-finding
operation
connected
with
postconviction
proceedings
and
petitions
as
possible.
so
the
congress
was
presented
with
the
two
conflicting
views
and
seems
to
have
adopted
senator
tydings
field
master.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
he
recommend
that
no
hearing
is
necessary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
the
judge
doesn’t
--
if
the
judge
accepts
that,
then
you
see
no
problem
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
--
i
am
a
little
confused,
you
said,
you
think
that
the
magistrate
can
conduct
this
preliminary
process
and
make
recommendations
to
the
judge
that
no
hearing
need
be
held
and
that
if
the
judge
accepts
that
recommendation,
it’s
alright.
thus
that
he
may
not
go
beyond
that
and
hear
the
testimony
and
then
make
proposed
recommendations
or
proposed
findings
of
fact
to
the
judge,
to
the
same
end
that
no
further
hearing
is
necessary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
anyone
claim,
does
anyone
contend
that
they
have
final
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
article
iii
sense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn’t
know
that
anyone
was
claiming
that
there
is
any
finality
about
the
magistrates’
findings
or
recommendations
anymore
than
there
is
with
the
commissioner
of
the
court
of
claims
or
hearing
examiner
of
the
federal
power
commission.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
magistrate
has,
as
in
this
case,
filed
his
report
and
recommendation,
summary
and
sent
the
electronic
tape
recorder,
was
there
anything
to
preclude
the
petitioner’s
lawyer
from
filing
a
request
or
filing
exceptions
to
the
report
and
asking
for
oral
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
is
there
anything
prevent
him
from
doing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
whether
to
grant
oral
argument
on
that
or
not,
as
i
take
it,
did
they
allow
oral
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we,
of
course,
decide
enormous
number
of
cases
here
without
oral
argument
too,
as
you
know.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
ringo?
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
disposition
of
73-846,
wingo
against
wedding
will
be
announced
by
