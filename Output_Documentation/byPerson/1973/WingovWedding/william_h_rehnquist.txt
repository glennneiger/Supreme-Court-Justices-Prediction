what
sort

do
you
have
before

court
after
the

has
made
findings
like
these?
did
you
have
oral
argument?

how
did
the
matter
go
up
to
them,
the
report
of
the
magistrate
and
briefs
of
the
parties?
justice
william

did
the

have
an
opportunity
to
brief
or
object
to
the
findings
of
the

before

gordon?
justice
william

why
is
it
that
you
say
that
a
magistrate
couldn’t
hear
a
suppression
matter
under
the
paragraph
(2).
it
seems
to
cover
it
by
its
terms,
doesn’t
it?

the
masters,
i
am
been
talking
about

justice
william

rehnquist
well,
this
is
a
civil

justice
william

this
is

mr.
glass,
did
you
object
during
the
proceedings
before
the
magistrate
that
he
was
not
empowered
or
ought
not
to
be
conducting
to
serve
the
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
that
in
the
records
somewhere?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
one
of
your
concerns,
mr.
glass
what
i
would
consider
as
perfectly
legitimate
feeling
that
although
the
rule
perhaps
contemplates
the
district
judge
sit
there
and
listen
to
the
tapes
if
he
is
busy
and
doesn’t
want
to
just
duplicate
the
time
that
the
magistrate
put
in,
he
may
short
circuit
that
process
a
little
bit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
the
district
court
held
a
hearing
under
those
ground
rules,
would
you
say
that
the
district
judge
would
be
justified
excluding
out
of
hand
any
effort
on
the
part
of
either
party
to
go
beyond
the
magistrate’s
recommendations
as
to
the
issues
that
evidence
should
be
received
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
you
have
filed
your
motion
or
notice,
would
the
district
court
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
magistrate’s
recommendation
to
say,
“no,
i
do
not
propose
to
hear
that,
we
are
going
to
limit
it
to
the
issues
specified
by
the
