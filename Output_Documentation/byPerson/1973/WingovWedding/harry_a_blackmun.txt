mr.
ringo,
do
you
know
that
the
us
magistrate
have
to
be
a
lawyer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
he
might
not
be?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
might
have
a
situation
where
us
magistrate
is
proposing
the
findings
and
conclusions
when
he
is
not
a
lawyer,
even
though
a
conviction
for
instance
has
been
affirmed
up
through
the
kentucky
court
system.
does
this
bother
you
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
ringo,
what
comment
do
you
have
about
the
provision
in
636
(b)
(3)
zeroing
in
on
preliminary
review
of
applications
for
posttrial
relief,
and
enough
with
--
to
facilitate
the
decision
of
a
district
judge
having
jurisdiction
over
the
case
has
whether
there
should
be
a
hearing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
the
sixth
circuit
touch
upon
the
constitution
issue
at
all,
or
did
they
decide
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
we
should
disagree
with
them,
do
you
think
then
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
have
them
considered
constitutional
issue
in
the
first
place?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
statute
certainly
(inaudible)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
mr.
glass,
what
is
your
comment
about
the
provision
and
the
statute
that
giving
the
magistrate
the
power
to
conduct
certain
trials
under
section
3401
of
the
code,
if
he
has
that
power,
what
is
so
wrong
with
giving
him
the
power
to
conduct
a
preliminary
hearing?
justice
