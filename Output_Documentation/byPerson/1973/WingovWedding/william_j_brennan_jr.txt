justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
go
at
least
as
far
as
having
the
magistrate
sufficiently
examine
the
matter
that
to
be
able
to
say
to
the
district
judge,
“it’s
my
recommendation
to
you
don’t
have
a
hearing.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
can’t
--
in
your
submission
that
he
can’t
and
so
the
sixth
circuit
held.
he
can’t
go
beyond
that
and
conduct
the
actual
evidentiary
hearing
and
submit
the
record
of
that
evidentiary
hearing
to
the
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
which
there
are
exceptions
then
by
a
counsel?
there
is
an
argument
on
the
exceptions
before
the
judges,
not
the
usual
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
gather,
senator
tydings
gave
him
rather
a
difficult
time,
well,
didn’t
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
really
your
emphasis
on
holiday,
you
get
back
to
the
fact
that
the
words
used
to
be
court
justice
or
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
congress
amended
it
just
to
make
it
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
your
circuit
at
least
said
that,
that
made
no
change
and
obviously,
whatever
else
might
be
to
the
magistrates
act
--
i
mean
habeas
corpus
act
always
said
court,
meant
court.
and
that
made
an
article
iii
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
really
the
gist
of
it,
and
i
guess
that
--
i
gather
that’s
actually
the
basis
for
sixth
circuit
both
in
this
case
and
in
wingo?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
suggest,
for
example,
he
might
take
the
state
record
and
go
all
through
that
and
conclude
the
requirements
of
townsend
and
sain
had
been
satisfied.
and
then
for
that
reason,
the
case
could
not
be
decided
on
the
state
record
without
any
further
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
magistrate
could
do
this
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
would
--
if
he
had
that
basis,
that
goes
rather
far
because
he
is
now
making
the
decision
that
there
is
a
sufficient
hearing
in
the
state
proceeding
not
to
require
an
additional
one
and
at
the
federal
constitutional
claims
whatever
they
may
be,
they
would
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
state
record
without
supplementing
it
with
any
federal
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
i
(voice
overlap)
i
expect
in
many
of
these
habeas
corpus
cases,
it
ought
to
be
true
that
constitutional
claims
can
be
determined
on
a
state
record
without
supplementing
it
with
a
federal
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
what
townsend
v.
sain
(inaudible).
well,
can
a
magistrate
be
given
the
responsibility
do
you
think
examining
the
state
record,
concluding
that
it
suffices
for
the
position
of
the
federal
constitutional
claims
and
therefore
recommend
that
there
is
no
reason
to
have
any
further
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
district
judges
must
personally
conduct
evidentiary
hearings
in
federal
habeas
corpus
cases
and
are
not
authorize
--
and
may
not
authorize
full-time
federal
magistrates
to
hold
such
evidentiary
hearings
for
them.
we
agree
and
affirm.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white
has
joined.
justice
william
j.
