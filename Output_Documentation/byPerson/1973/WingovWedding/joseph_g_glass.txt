mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
respondent’s
contention
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
we
have
contended
throughout
these
proceedings
from
the
very
inception
that
the
language
of
the
28
u.s.c.
636
(b)
(3)
is
very
clear
and
very
explicit.
in
that
it
provides
for
a
preliminary
review
by
the
magistrate
of
postconviction
and
posttrial
proceedings
and
it
provides
for
a
report
and
recommendations
as
to
whether
there
should
be
an
evidentiary
hearing.
and
it
has
been
our
contention
that
the
language
is
very
clear
on
that,
that
it
doesn’t
provide
that
the
magistrate
may
hold
himself
in
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
it
does
embrace
a
suppression
of
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
would
think
that
--
it’s
my
impression
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
would
encompass
something
like
a
pretrial
conference,
whereby
the
party
litigants
through
counsel
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir
in
our
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
there
are
few.
there
are
not
many.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
many
of
them
are
the
suppression
type
of
motions
or
motions
on
the
constitutionality
of
statutes
and
things
of
that
matter.
but
from
time
to
time,
there
are
conferences
with
the
court
on
legal
matters
and
criminal
cases.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
as
i
interpret
criminal
rule
41
and
as
i
have
read
the
cases,
that’s
within
the
providence
of
a
district
court
judge
and
that
is
a
fact-finding
process,
and
i
think
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about
here
in
these
proceedings,
fact-finding
processes.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
that’s
an
advisory
position
but
it’s
not
an
evidentiary
position.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
not
as
this
court,
in
1941,
interpreted
holiday
versus
johnson
and
later,
in
1963,
interpreted
townsend
versus
sain
when
it
talked
about
the
demeanor
of
witnesses
and
the
credibility
of
witnesses.
that’s
within
the
providence
i
think
of
the
district
judge.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
the
rule
636
--
of
our
local
rule?
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir.
i
am
sure
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
well,
i
think
that’s
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
intended
for
the
magistrate
to
be
recommending
agency
and
not
an
evidentiary
hearing
judge.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
no,
sir.
habeas
corpus
doesn’t
provide
that
a
judge
must
hold
hearing
in
every
case
nor
it’s
our
contention
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
magistrates
act
does
not
authorize
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
any
case
by
the
magistrate
that
this
is
within
the
providence
of
a
district
judge.
now,
there
are
certain
things
that
he
can
do.
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
goes
a
long
way
towards
explaining
when
it
says
to
alleviate
the
judge
from
having
to
do
the
routine.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
think
that’s
permissible
because
lower
courts
have
been
functioning
in
that
capacity
for
years.
that’s
an
advisory.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that
is
our
contention
your
honor
based
on
holiday
versus
johnson
and
actually
townsend
versus
sain
when
it
talks
about
the
providence
of
the
district
judge’s
weigh
the
credibility
and
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
which
is
unquestionably
very
important,
and
perhaps,
in
many
instances,
the
most
important
step
in
the
habeas
corpus
matter
as
such.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
to
take
evidence
in
civil
cases
your
honor,
that’s
--
i
am
not
that
familiar
with,
in
criminal
cases
they
are
not
allowed,
and
then
going
back
to
holiday
versus
johnson
1971,
payne
versus
wingo
when
our
sixth
circuit
held
at
the
special
master,
and
in
this
case,
it
was
the
duly
appointed
united
states
commissioner.
that’s
at
442
fed
2d
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
in
a
civil
case,
he
is
allowed
under
the
laws
as
i
have
read
them
mr.
justice
white
to
take
depositions
and
things
of
that
nature,
but
within
an
evidentiary
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
as
an
adviser.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
justice
brennan,
both
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
have
cited
cases
for
example
tpo,
inc.
which
have
held
that
there
are
only
certain
things
in
the
civil
nature
that
the
magistrate
can
do,
but
they
cannot
be
a
part
of
the
decision-making
process.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
well,
here
again,
i
think,
it
can’t
be
part
of
the
decision-making
process.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
well,
in
civil
proceedings,
i
have
less
concerned
about
that
than
i
do
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
am
not
that
knowledgeable
mr.
justice
white
to
really
give
you
a
good
answer
on
that.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
am
reading
some
of
the
background
on
habeas
corpus
as
this
is
my
understanding,
but
here
again,
some
of
the
authors
and
i
believe
that’s
been
covered
in
(inaudible)
jury
trials
and
article
by
mr.
skoku
(ph)
and
also
an
83
harvard
law
review
that
has
defined
this
type
of
proceedings
as
advisory
proceedings.
it’s
my
recollection.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
it’s
denominated
as
such
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
fully
--
i
would
go
back
to
legislative
history
on
that
where
mr.
fred
vinson
had
some
colloquy
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
fred
vinson.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir,
he
sure
did
but
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
if
the
court
please,
i
subscribe
to
mr.
vinson.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
28
u.s.c.
2243
speaks
in
specific.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir,
and
here
again
going
back
to
the
legislative
history,
initially,
when
the
statute
was
drafted,
it
provided
for
preliminary
consideration
rather
than
preliminary
review
and
because
of
all
of
the
evidence
that
came
out
as
a
result
of
the
hearings,
they
have
redrafted
the
legislation
to
a
preliminary
review
for
of
posttrial.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
unquestionably.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
are
some
provisions
in
that
statute
which
i
think
are
important
for
this
court
to
consider.
number
one,
the
magistrate
in
those
federal
crimes
statute
has
jurisdiction
over
those
crimes,
which
are
normally
denominated
as
misdemeanors
up
to
a
year,
carrying
up
to
a
year
in
the
penitentiary
up
to
$1,000
fine
or
both.
however,
there
is
also
the
provision
that
the
defendant
and
the
government
have
to
agree
to
the
trial
before
the
magistrate,
and
there
is
also
of
course
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
district
court.
but
i
think
that’s
a
very
important
distinction
because
not
only
does
it
take
the
agreement
of
the
parties
but
the
magistrate
only
has
that
limited
jurisdiction.
whereas,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
magistrate
have
the
authority
to
hold
evidentiary
hearings,
he
would
be
weighing
the
liberty
of
persons
filing
habeas
corpus
who
are
incarcerated
for
a
much
more
lengthy
period
of
time
as,
for
example,
the
respondent
in
this
case
who
is
under
a
life
sentence.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
on
a
habeas?
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall
that
he
can
review
the
pleadings;
that
he
can
appoint
counsel
when
necessary;
that
with
the
aid
of
counsel,
he
can
define
the
legal
issues;
that
with
the
aid
of
counsel,
he
can
set
out
an
order
of
proof
for
the
evidentiary
proceedings
if
that
should
be
necessary;
that
he
can
submit
a
summary
of
the
case
to
the
district
judge;
and
that
with
the
aid
of
counsel
on
both
sides,
he
can
project
the
length
of
the
hearing
that
might
be
required
before
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
certainly,
i
think
that
is
within
the
district
judge
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
if
he
is
recommending
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
don’t
think
there’s
anything
that
--
i
think
he
is
authorized
to
do
that
under
the
act.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
in
the
point
of
fact
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
filed
a
motion,
a
lengthy
motion
with
the
memorandum
brief
to
disqualify
the
magistrate
from
holding
the
evidentiary
hearing
prior
to
it
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir
and
it’s
contained
in
the
appendix
on
pages
15,
16
and
the
memorandum,
the
17,
18,
19,
20,
21,
22,
23,
24,
25,
26
and
27.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
not
personally,
no
sir.
it
was
on
the
grounds
that
i
didn’t
think
that
the
act
provided
for
him
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
make
the
request
in
writing
and
that’s
the
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
also
correct.
in
this
case,
he
listened
to
and
added
some
tape
recording
disc
of
the
hearing
as
it
was
taken
down
at
the
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
the
posttrial
consideration
that
he
would
be
authorized
to
do.
i
think
primarily,
he
would
be
directing
himself
as
a
matter
of
law
in
looking
towards,
whether
the
habeas
corpus
satisfies
the
pre-requisites
of
townsend
versus
sain
in
1963
and
perhaps
fay
versus
noia
in
1963.
but
here
again
looking
towards
the
legal
aspects
and
the
formality
of
the
pleadings
and
thereafter
submit
a
report
on
whether
there
should
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
townsend
versus
sain
allows
that
and
he
would
have
to
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir.
i
think
he
would
have
to
serve
notice
on
the
parties
as
to
his
report
and
recommendations
along
those
lines.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
justice
brennan,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
think
he
can
make
recommendations
based
upon
the
law
to
the
judge.
i
think
the
judge
--
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
question
within
the
circuits
that
the
district
judge
is
the
ultimate
decider
of
the
question.
i
do
not
think
that
that’s
going
to
be
changed.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
as
i
read
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
think
he
can
draw
his
own
conclusions
in
that
regard
and
submit
them
to
the
district
judge
by
way
of
documentation,
and
outline
in
that
report
and
recommendations
why
he
believes
his
findings
to
be
correct,
and
if
the
district
judge
accepts
them
and
then
i
suppose,
perhaps
they
can
dismiss
the
petitions
that
having
set
aside
been
satisfied
in
the
state
proceedings.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir
it
is.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
i
think,
it’s
very
important
to
consider
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
both
parties
in
the
brief
and
also,
as
petitioners
conceded
on
page
12
in
his
brief
that
the
magistrates
do
not
have
the
authority
to
decide
or
make
all
the
determination
of
fact
cases
or
controversies.
this
must
be
left
to
article
iii
courts.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
well,
i
think
that
if
you
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
in
the
article
iii,
that
they
have
--
that
the
magistrates
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
not
as
such
but
many
of
the
courts
have
expressed,
for
example,
in
the
rainha
versus
cassidy,
the
pro
forma
laying
on
of
hands
of
the
magistrates
report
and
recommendations
without,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
anyone
being
there
at
a
review
how
much
input
went
into
that
particular
review
of
the
report
and
recommendations.
i
think
that’s
the
major
concern
in
some
of
the
cases
that
have
even
upheld
or
going
towards
upholding,
the
magistrates’
holding
of
the
evidentiary
hearing,
for
example
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct.
and
then
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
district
court
appointed
the
magistrate.
during
this
intervening
time,
the
magistrate
had
been
appointed
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
appointed
in
1971
late
as
i
recall.
prior
to
that,
we
had
a
commissioner
during
the
first
three
years
of
the
act
was
identified.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
chief
justice,
the
rule
doesn’t
provide
for
oral
argument.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
no
sir,
but
i
did
file
a
memorandum
taking
exceptions
to
the
commissioner
or
to
the
magistrate’s
report,
and
there
is
a
lengthy
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that,
i
think
it’s
a
legitimate
concern.
it’s
not
a
particular
concern
of
me
in
that
--
let
me
just
say
that
i
have
a
degree
of
faith
in
the
three
district
judges
that
we
have
in
the
western
district
of
kentucky.
however,
i
do
think
that
to
allow
the
magistrate
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
still
say
that
it’s
within
the
providence
of
the
article
iii
judge
to
hold
another
evidentiary
hearing
is
just
one
more
step
in
the
judicial
process
and
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
the
act
was
intended
for.
it’s
just
like
another
appeal
and
then
if
the
district
judge
rules
that
the
magistrate’s
finding
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
the
law
are
correct
then
you
go
up
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
our
situation
and
so
on.
and
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
the
act
calls
for.
the
act,
i
believe,
was
intended
simply
to
reduce
the
routine
of
mundane
workload
of
the
district
judge
so
that
he
could
address
himself
to
things
like
evidentiary
hearings.
and
sixth
circuit
noted
in
their
opinion
in
this
case
that
they
couldn’t
see
how
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
is
listening
to
the
tape
de
novo
would
require
anymore
time
than
an
actual
evidentiary
hearing.
and
along
the
lines
of
the
suggestions
that
i
have
made
that
the
magistrate
can
do,
i
think
that
he
could
reduce
the
time
necessary
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
could
probably
almost
pinpoint
it
by
taking
this
proceedings
through
with
counsel
in
the
form
of
plea
hearing
conferences
with
the
counsel,
because
the
counsel
are
appointed.
and
then
submit
a
report
to
the
judge
that
the
hearing
is
going
to
take
45
minutes
or
it’s
going
to
take
an-hour-and-a-half.
it’s
going
to
take
three
hours.
these
are
the
witnesses
that
are
probably
to
be
called.
these
are
the
issues
that
will
probably
be
determined.
these
are
the
facts
that
will
probably
be
determined.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
think
if
it
were
important
and
i
would
submit
that
if
that
were
the
situation,
if
there
would
in
all
probability
be
a
proviso
that
written
motions
or
request
or
notices
could
be
filed
with
the
court
if
the
hearing
were
going
to
include
anything
other
than
that
which
was
laid
out
by
the
recommendations
of
the
magistrate.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
--
if
i
can
make
an
analogy.
if
you
go
back
to
the
appellate
process
and
if
the
petitioner
and/or
his
counsel
knew
at
the
time
they
had
the
pre-hearing
conference
with
the
magistrate
that
certain
matters
were
available,
that
certain
people
were
available,
if
they
wanted
to
get
a
certain
issue
into
evidence
if
they
knew
at
that
time
and
didn’t
disclose
it,
then
i
think
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
bring
it
up
by
a
way
of
notice
or
within
the
hearing
itself
under
those
circumstances.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
respondent’s
contention
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
we
have
contended
throughout
these
proceedings
from
the
very
inception
that
the
language
of
the
28
u.s.c.
636
(b)
(3)
is
very
clear
and
very
explicit.
in
that
it
provides
for
a
preliminary
review
by
the
magistrate
of
postconviction
and
posttrial
proceedings
and
it
provides
for
a
report
and
recommendations
as
to
whether
there
should
be
an
evidentiary
hearing.
and
it
has
been
our
contention
that
the
language
is
very
clear
on
that,
that
it
doesn’t
provide
that
the
magistrate
may
hold
himself
in
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
it
does
embrace
a
suppression
of
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
would
think
that
--
it’s
my
impression
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
would
encompass
something
like
a
pretrial
conference,
whereby
the
party
litigants
through
counsel
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir
in
our
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
there
are
few.
there
are
not
many.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
many
of
them
are
the
suppression
type
of
motions
or
motions
on
the
constitutionality
of
statutes
and
things
of
that
matter.
but
from
time
to
time,
there
are
conferences
with
the
court
on
legal
matters
and
criminal
cases.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
as
i
interpret
criminal
rule
41
and
as
i
have
read
the
cases,
that’s
within
the
providence
of
a
district
court
judge
and
that
is
a
fact-finding
process,
and
i
think
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about
here
in
these
proceedings,
fact-finding
processes.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
that’s
an
advisory
position
but
it’s
not
an
evidentiary
position.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
not
as
this
court,
in
1941,
interpreted
holiday
versus
johnson
and
later,
in
1963,
interpreted
townsend
versus
sain
when
it
talked
about
the
demeanor
of
witnesses
and
the
credibility
of
witnesses.
that’s
within
the
providence
i
think
of
the
district
judge.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
the
rule
636
--
of
our
local
rule?
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir.
i
am
sure
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
well,
i
think
that’s
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
intended
for
the
magistrate
to
be
recommending
agency
and
not
an
evidentiary
hearing
judge.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
no,
sir.
habeas
corpus
doesn’t
provide
that
a
judge
must
hold
hearing
in
every
case
nor
it’s
our
contention
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
magistrates
act
does
not
authorize
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
any
case
by
the
magistrate
that
this
is
within
the
providence
of
a
district
judge.
now,
there
are
certain
things
that
he
can
do.
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
goes
a
long
way
towards
explaining
when
it
says
to
alleviate
the
judge
from
having
to
do
the
routine.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
think
that’s
permissible
because
lower
courts
have
been
functioning
in
that
capacity
for
years.
that’s
an
advisory.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that
is
our
contention
your
honor
based
on
holiday
versus
johnson
and
actually
townsend
versus
sain
when
it
talks
about
the
providence
of
the
district
judge’s
weigh
the
credibility
and
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
which
is
unquestionably
very
important,
and
perhaps,
in
many
instances,
the
most
important
step
in
the
habeas
corpus
matter
as
such.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
to
take
evidence
in
civil
cases
your
honor,
that’s
--
i
am
not
that
familiar
with,
in
criminal
cases
they
are
not
allowed,
and
then
going
back
to
holiday
versus
johnson
1971,
payne
versus
wingo
when
our
sixth
circuit
held
at
the
special
master,
and
in
this
case,
it
was
the
duly
appointed
united
states
commissioner.
that’s
at
442
fed
2d
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
in
a
civil
case,
he
is
allowed
under
the
laws
as
i
have
read
them
mr.
justice
white
to
take
depositions
and
things
of
that
nature,
but
within
an
evidentiary
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
as
an
adviser.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
justice
brennan,
both
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
have
cited
cases
for
example
tpo,
inc.
which
have
held
that
there
are
only
certain
things
in
the
civil
nature
that
the
magistrate
can
do,
but
they
cannot
be
a
part
of
the
decision-making
process.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
well,
here
again,
i
think,
it
can’t
be
part
of
the
decision-making
process.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
well,
in
civil
proceedings,
i
have
less
concerned
about
that
than
i
do
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
am
not
that
knowledgeable
mr.
justice
white
to
really
give
you
a
good
answer
on
that.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
am
reading
some
of
the
background
on
habeas
corpus
as
this
is
my
understanding,
but
here
again,
some
of
the
authors
and
i
believe
that’s
been
covered
in
(inaudible)
jury
trials
and
article
by
mr.
skoku
(ph)
and
also
an
83
harvard
law
review
that
has
defined
this
type
of
proceedings
as
advisory
proceedings.
it’s
my
recollection.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
it’s
denominated
as
such
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
fully
--
i
would
go
back
to
legislative
history
on
that
where
mr.
fred
vinson
had
some
colloquy
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
fred
vinson.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir,
he
sure
did
but
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
if
the
court
please,
i
subscribe
to
mr.
vinson.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
28
u.s.c.
2243
speaks
in
specific.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir,
and
here
again
going
back
to
the
legislative
history,
initially,
when
the
statute
was
drafted,
it
provided
for
preliminary
consideration
rather
than
preliminary
review
and
because
of
all
of
the
evidence
that
came
out
as
a
result
of
the
hearings,
they
have
redrafted
the
legislation
to
a
preliminary
review
for
of
posttrial.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
unquestionably.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
are
some
provisions
in
that
statute
which
i
think
are
important
for
this
court
to
consider.
number
one,
the
magistrate
in
those
federal
crimes
statute
has
jurisdiction
over
those
crimes,
which
are
normally
denominated
as
misdemeanors
up
to
a
year,
carrying
up
to
a
year
in
the
penitentiary
up
to
$1,000
fine
or
both.
however,
there
is
also
the
provision
that
the
defendant
and
the
government
have
to
agree
to
the
trial
before
the
magistrate,
and
there
is
also
of
course
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
district
court.
but
i
think
that’s
a
very
important
distinction
because
not
only
does
it
take
the
agreement
of
the
parties
but
the
magistrate
only
has
that
limited
jurisdiction.
whereas,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
magistrate
have
the
authority
to
hold
evidentiary
hearings,
he
would
be
weighing
the
liberty
of
persons
filing
habeas
corpus
who
are
incarcerated
for
a
much
more
lengthy
period
of
time
as,
for
example,
the
respondent
in
this
case
who
is
under
a
life
sentence.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
on
a
habeas?
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall
that
he
can
review
the
pleadings;
that
he
can
appoint
counsel
when
necessary;
that
with
the
aid
of
counsel,
he
can
define
the
legal
issues;
that
with
the
aid
of
counsel,
he
can
set
out
an
order
of
proof
for
the
evidentiary
proceedings
if
that
should
be
necessary;
that
he
can
submit
a
summary
of
the
case
to
the
district
judge;
and
that
with
the
aid
of
counsel
on
both
sides,
he
can
project
the
length
of
the
hearing
that
might
be
required
before
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
certainly,
i
think
that
is
within
the
district
judge
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
if
he
is
recommending
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
don’t
think
there’s
anything
that
--
i
think
he
is
authorized
to
do
that
under
the
act.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
in
the
point
of
fact
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
filed
a
motion,
a
lengthy
motion
with
the
memorandum
brief
to
disqualify
the
magistrate
from
holding
the
evidentiary
hearing
prior
to
it
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir
and
it’s
contained
in
the
appendix
on
pages
15,
16
and
the
memorandum,
the
17,
18,
19,
20,
21,
22,
23,
24,
25,
26
and
27.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
not
personally,
no
sir.
it
was
on
the
grounds
that
i
didn’t
think
that
the
act
provided
for
him
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
make
the
request
in
writing
and
that’s
the
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
also
correct.
in
this
case,
he
listened
to
and
added
some
tape
recording
disc
of
the
hearing
as
it
was
taken
down
at
the
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
the
posttrial
consideration
that
he
would
be
authorized
to
do.
i
think
primarily,
he
would
be
directing
himself
as
a
matter
of
law
in
looking
towards,
whether
the
habeas
corpus
satisfies
the
pre-requisites
of
townsend
versus
sain
in
1963
and
perhaps
fay
versus
noia
in
1963.
but
here
again
looking
towards
the
legal
aspects
and
the
formality
of
the
pleadings
and
thereafter
submit
a
report
on
whether
there
should
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
townsend
versus
sain
allows
that
and
he
would
have
to
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes
sir.
i
think
he
would
have
to
serve
notice
on
the
parties
as
to
his
report
and
recommendations
along
those
lines.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
justice
brennan,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
think
he
can
make
recommendations
based
upon
the
law
to
the
judge.
i
think
the
judge
--
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
question
within
the
circuits
that
the
district
judge
is
the
ultimate
decider
of
the
question.
i
do
not
think
that
that’s
going
to
be
changed.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
as
i
read
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
think
he
can
draw
his
own
conclusions
in
that
regard
and
submit
them
to
the
district
judge
by
way
of
documentation,
and
outline
in
that
report
and
recommendations
why
he
believes
his
findings
to
be
correct,
and
if
the
district
judge
accepts
them
and
then
i
suppose,
perhaps
they
can
dismiss
the
petitions
that
having
set
aside
been
satisfied
in
the
state
proceedings.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir
it
is.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
i
think,
it’s
very
important
to
consider
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
both
parties
in
the
brief
and
also,
as
petitioners
conceded
on
page
12
in
his
brief
that
the
magistrates
do
not
have
the
authority
to
decide
or
make
all
the
determination
of
fact
cases
or
controversies.
this
must
be
left
to
article
iii
courts.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
well,
i
think
that
if
you
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
in
the
article
iii,
that
they
have
--
that
the
magistrates
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
not
as
such
but
many
of
the
courts
have
expressed,
for
example,
in
the
rainha
versus
cassidy,
the
pro
forma
laying
on
of
hands
of
the
magistrates
report
and
recommendations
without,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
anyone
being
there
at
a
review
how
much
input
went
into
that
particular
review
of
the
report
and
recommendations.
i
think
that’s
the
major
concern
in
some
of
the
cases
that
have
even
upheld
or
going
towards
upholding,
the
magistrates’
holding
of
the
evidentiary
hearing,
for
example
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that’s
correct.
and
then
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
district
court
appointed
the
magistrate.
during
this
intervening
time,
the
magistrate
had
been
appointed
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
appointed
in
1971
late
as
i
recall.
prior
to
that,
we
had
a
commissioner
during
the
first
three
years
of
the
act
was
identified.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
mr.
chief
justice,
the
rule
doesn’t
provide
for
oral
argument.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
no
sir,
but
i
did
file
a
memorandum
taking
exceptions
to
the
commissioner
or
to
the
magistrate’s
report,
and
there
is
a
lengthy
--
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
that,
i
think
it’s
a
legitimate
concern.
it’s
not
a
particular
concern
of
me
in
that
--
let
me
just
say
that
i
have
a
degree
of
faith
in
the
three
district
judges
that
we
have
in
the
western
district
of
kentucky.
however,
i
do
think
that
to
allow
the
magistrate
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
still
say
that
it’s
within
the
providence
of
the
article
iii
judge
to
hold
another
evidentiary
hearing
is
just
one
more
step
in
the
judicial
process
and
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
the
act
was
intended
for.
it’s
just
like
another
appeal
and
then
if
the
district
judge
rules
that
the
magistrate’s
finding
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
the
law
are
correct
then
you
go
up
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
our
situation
and
so
on.
and
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
the
act
calls
for.
the
act,
i
believe,
was
intended
simply
to
reduce
the
routine
of
mundane
workload
of
the
district
judge
so
that
he
could
address
himself
to
things
like
evidentiary
hearings.
and
sixth
circuit
noted
in
their
opinion
in
this
case
that
they
couldn’t
see
how
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
is
listening
to
the
tape
de
novo
would
require
anymore
time
than
an
actual
evidentiary
hearing.
and
along
the
lines
of
the
suggestions
that
i
have
made
that
the
magistrate
can
do,
i
think
that
he
could
reduce
the
time
necessary
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
could
probably
almost
pinpoint
it
by
taking
this
proceedings
through
with
counsel
in
the
form
of
plea
hearing
conferences
with
the
counsel,
because
the
counsel
are
appointed.
and
then
submit
a
report
to
the
judge
that
the
hearing
is
going
to
take
45
minutes
or
it’s
going
to
take
an-hour-and-a-half.
it’s
going
to
take
three
hours.
these
are
the
witnesses
that
are
probably
to
be
called.
these
are
the
issues
that
will
probably
be
determined.
these
are
the
facts
that
will
probably
be
determined.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
think
if
it
were
important
and
i
would
submit
that
if
that
were
the
situation,
if
there
would
in
all
probability
be
a
proviso
that
written
motions
or
request
or
notices
could
be
filed
with
the
court
if
the
hearing
were
going
to
include
anything
other
than
that
which
was
laid
out
by
the
recommendations
of
the
magistrate.
mr.
joseph
g.
glass
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
--
if
i
can
make
an
analogy.
if
you
go
back
to
the
appellate
process
and
if
the
petitioner
and/or
his
counsel
knew
at
the
time
they
had
the
pre-hearing
conference
with
the
magistrate
that
certain
matters
were
available,
that
certain
people
were
available,
if
they
wanted
to
get
a
certain
issue
into
evidence
if
they
knew
at
that
time
and
didn’t
disclose
it,
then
i
think
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
bring
it
up
by
a
way
of
notice
or
within
the
hearing
itself
under
those
circumstances.
thank
you.
