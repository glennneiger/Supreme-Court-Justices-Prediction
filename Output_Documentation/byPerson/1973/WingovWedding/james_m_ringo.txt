mr.
james
m.
ringo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
today
in
this
case
is
whether
us
magistrates
are
empowered
by
the
federal
magistrates
act
of
1968
to
conduct
the
evidentiary
hearings
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
i
would
like
to
first
briefly
tell
how
the
case
got
to
this
court
today.
in
1971,
the
respondent,
carl
james
wedding,
after
exhausting
all
his
available
state
postconviction
remedies,
filed
a
petition
in
us
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
kentucky,
claiming
that
his
1949
conviction
for
willful
murder
was
invalid
based
on
contention
of
court’s
plea
of
guilty,
in
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
district
court
reviewed
his
petition
and
summarily
dismissed
as
being
without
merit.
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
was
granted.
the
respondent,
mr.
wedding,
then
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
the
district
court’s
decision
saying
that
the
petition
presented
certain
factual
questions
which
require
an
evidentiary
hearing.
on
remand,
the
matter
was
assigned
to
the
us
magistrate
to
conduct
the
evidentiary
hearing.
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
conducted
by
the
magistrate
and
recorded
by
electronic
sound
recorder.
the
magistrate,
in
conducting
the
hearing
concerning
all
the
pleadings
and
all
available
state
records,
made
a
finding
of
fact,
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusion
of
law,
report
and
recommendation
that
the
petition
of
mr.
wedding
be
dismissed.
the
district
court
upon
request
by
counsel
for
respondent,
mr.
wedding,
gave
the
double
considerations
of
recorded
testimony,
electronically
recorded
testimony
of
the
hearing.
thereafter,
the
district
judge
after
reviewing
all
of
the
pleadings,
they
recorded
all
the
considerations
of
recording
of
the
evidentiary
hearing,
adopted
the
magistrate’s
findings
of
facts,
conclusions
of
law,
report
and
recommendation
as
his
own
and
dismissed
the
petition.
whereupon,
the
respondent
once
again
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
again,
stating
that
us
magistrates
are
not
empowered
by
the
federal
magistrates
act
to
conduct
the
evidentiary
hearings
in
habeas
corpus
case.
we
submit
that
the
magistrates
are
empowered
by
the
section
636
(b)
of
the
federal
magistrates
act
to
conduct
the
evidentiary
hearing
of
posttrial
cases.
636
(b)
in
substance
states
that
by
concurrence
of
the
majority
of
the
judges
of
the
district
court,
they
can
adopt
assigned
additional
duties
to
the
us
magistrates,
so
long
as
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states.
inherent
in
this
language
are
two
limitations
on
the
duties
assignable
to
the
magistrate:
first,
the
magistrate
may
act
only
pursuant
to
a
rule
passed
by
a
majority
of
the
judges
of
the
district
court,
as
was
done
in
this
case;
and
two,
the
duties
so
assignable
must
be
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
yes,
that’s
true
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
i
didn’t
say
that,
but
it’s
true.
these
limitations
which
i
have
just
mentioned
are
recognized
by
the
drafters
of
the
proposed
rules
governing
habeas
corpus
proceeding
which
is
presently
before
the
standing
committee
on
rules
and
practice
and
procedure
of
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states.
these
proposed
rules
give
magistrates
the
power
to
conduct
evidentiary
hearings
in
habeas
corpus
cases
citing
section
636
(b)
as
authority.
we
submit
that
allowing
us
magistrate
to
conduct
evidentiary
hearings
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
or
laws
of
united
states.
the
respondent
and
the
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
the
act
requires
your
honor
that
the
full-time
us
magistrate
should
be
a
lawyer
except
in
situations
where
they
are
not
available
in
the
districts.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
in
the
instant
case,
it
does
not,
because
our
magistrate
was
a
lawyer.
the
duty
of
appointing
the
magistrate
is
upon
the
concurrence
of
the
majority
of
the
district
judges
and
i
would
submit
that
the
judges
would
select
a
very
qualified
case
in
the
event
that
there
were
no
lawyers.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
i
have
no
statistics
on
that.
i
know
but
that
the
us
commissioner
system,
which
this
system
replaced
that
30%
were
not
lawyers.
the
respondent
in
the
sixth
circuit
denies
this
position
that
the
magistrate
act
is
inconsistent
with
the
habeas
corpus
act
in
constructing
two
statutes
unlike
service.
it
is
necessary
to
look
to
the
intent
and
purpose
of
both
acts.
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
was
to
determine
the
legality
of
the
intention
of
the
person
held
and
restraint
of
his
liberty.
now
the
intent
of
the
magistrate
act
in
respect
to
the
habeas
corpus
petitions,
it
was
clearly
that
the
intention
of
congress
to
have
magistrates
assists
the
overburdened
--
the
courts
which
are
overburdened
by
habeas
corpus
applications.
by
reviewing
habeas
corpus
applications
and
conducting
evidentiary
hearings,
if
necessary,
in
order
that
the
judge
might
have
before
him
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
petition
to
facilitate
his
ultimate
determination
of
the
fact
of
the
petition.
in
order
that
this
new
tier
of
judicial
office
which
was
created
by
the
magistrate
act
of
1968,
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
perform
this
function,
congress
upgraded
the
old
commissioner
system
not
only
in
position
but
in
the
qualifications
so
that
magistrates
would
be
qualified
to
adequately
perform
this
must
needed
assistance
to
the
judges
of
their
crowded
dockets
of
habeas
corpus
petitions.
for
this
reason,
we
submit
that
the
magistrates
act
is
consistent
with
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
actually
forces
or
supports
its
purpose
and
intent,
and
that
it
ensures
that
the
person
was
illegally
--
who
is
detained
is
getting
upon
determination
as
to
the
legality
of
his
restraint
of
his
liberty.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
the
intention
of
congress
on
that
636
(b)
subsection
(3)
was
clear
that
this
was
merely
a
suggested
rather
than
a
required
duty.
therefore,
it
is
not
exclusive
on
the
subject
of
ways
on
which
the
magistrates
might
be
using
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
congress
intended
to
make
this
636
(b)
purposely
broad
and
flexible
in
order
that
the
judges
might
be
able
to
utilize
the
magistrates
to
the
efficiency
of
the
district
court.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
well,
that’s
where
within
his
providence
the
district
judge
can
accept,
reject,
demand,
or
do
what
he
wants
to
with
the
magistrates
report,
findings
of
facts,
conclusion
of
low
and
so
forth.
so
we
submit
also
that
the
magistrates
act
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution.
the
argument
has
been
made
in
respect
to
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
article
iii
vests
the
judicial
power
in
the
supreme
court
and
other
inferior
courts
as
the
district
court.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
primarily,
statutory
construction
--
i
mean
if
they
are
ever
used
in
generous
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
the
constitutional
issue
should
be
considered.
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerning
article
iii,
the
congress
stated
that
it
was
their
intention
that
the
magistrate
was
not
to
have
any
power
to
make
the
ultimate
determination
of
fact,
and
we
concede
this
point
that
the
ultimate
determination
of
fact
must
be
made
by
the
article
iii
judge
himself.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
in
this
case
there
were
no
oral
arguments.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
the
matter
was
before
the
court
on
a
petition
in
response
to
the
petition
that
came
back
on
a
sixth
circuit
on
the
first
reverse
and
remand.
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
held.
assessment
to
the
evidentiary
hearing,
our
office
can
have
copies
of
all
the
available
state
proceedings,
and
from
there,
the
judge
considered
de
novo
the
recorded
testimony,
the
available
state
records
which
were
submitted
to
the
court
and
all
the
previous
pleadings,
and
therein
he
adopted
the
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law
of
the
magistrate
as
his
own.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
i
don’t
believe
that
there
was
any
objection,
any
objection
made
by
the
party.
for
the
foregoing
reasons,
because
the
assigned
additional
duty
to
the
us
magistrate
of
conducting
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
neither
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
we
submit
that
this
may
be
done.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
that’s
true.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
he
can
consider
the
evidence
in
light
of
the
state
records,
he
gave
a
de
novo
consideration
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
to
get
before
the
court
all
the
facts
and
--
this
is
why
the
congress
set
up
the
judicial
tier
of
magistrates.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
we
submitted
that
article
iii
judges
are
vested
with
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
or
the
power
to
decide.
the
congress
upgraded
the
system
as
the
magistrates
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
they
went
far
enough
to
give
in
the
qualifications
which
would
enable
them
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
if
he
thinks
that
they
are
adequately
prepared.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
they
have
upgraded
the
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
it
was
the
intention
of
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
it’s
his
job
to
determine
the
ultimate
fact.
the
congress
intended
to
upgrade
the
qualifications
of
magistrates
in
order
that
he
might
be
vested
with
certain
investigatory
powers,
so
to
speak,
in
order
that
he
could
facilitate
the
decision
of
the
judge,
but
the
problem
with
an
overburdened
habeas
corpus
applicants
is
the
fact
that
the
judge
does
not
have
to
run
all
the
wheat
from
the
chaff,
so
to
speak,
of
all
his
applications.
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
congress
intended
for
the
magistrate
to
be
able
to
perform.
thank
you.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
today
in
this
case
is
whether
us
magistrates
are
empowered
by
the
federal
magistrates
act
of
1968
to
conduct
the
evidentiary
hearings
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
i
would
like
to
first
briefly
tell
how
the
case
got
to
this
court
today.
in
1971,
the
respondent,
carl
james
wedding,
after
exhausting
all
his
available
state
postconviction
remedies,
filed
a
petition
in
us
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
kentucky,
claiming
that
his
1949
conviction
for
willful
murder
was
invalid
based
on
contention
of
court’s
plea
of
guilty,
in
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
district
court
reviewed
his
petition
and
summarily
dismissed
as
being
without
merit.
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
was
granted.
the
respondent,
mr.
wedding,
then
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
the
district
court’s
decision
saying
that
the
petition
presented
certain
factual
questions
which
require
an
evidentiary
hearing.
on
remand,
the
matter
was
assigned
to
the
us
magistrate
to
conduct
the
evidentiary
hearing.
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
conducted
by
the
magistrate
and
recorded
by
electronic
sound
recorder.
the
magistrate,
in
conducting
the
hearing
concerning
all
the
pleadings
and
all
available
state
records,
made
a
finding
of
fact,
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusion
of
law,
report
and
recommendation
that
the
petition
of
mr.
wedding
be
dismissed.
the
district
court
upon
request
by
counsel
for
respondent,
mr.
wedding,
gave
the
double
considerations
of
recorded
testimony,
electronically
recorded
testimony
of
the
hearing.
thereafter,
the
district
judge
after
reviewing
all
of
the
pleadings,
they
recorded
all
the
considerations
of
recording
of
the
evidentiary
hearing,
adopted
the
magistrate’s
findings
of
facts,
conclusions
of
law,
report
and
recommendation
as
his
own
and
dismissed
the
petition.
whereupon,
the
respondent
once
again
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
again,
stating
that
us
magistrates
are
not
empowered
by
the
federal
magistrates
act
to
conduct
the
evidentiary
hearings
in
habeas
corpus
case.
we
submit
that
the
magistrates
are
empowered
by
the
section
636
(b)
of
the
federal
magistrates
act
to
conduct
the
evidentiary
hearing
of
posttrial
cases.
636
(b)
in
substance
states
that
by
concurrence
of
the
majority
of
the
judges
of
the
district
court,
they
can
adopt
assigned
additional
duties
to
the
us
magistrates,
so
long
as
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states.
inherent
in
this
language
are
two
limitations
on
the
duties
assignable
to
the
magistrate:
first,
the
magistrate
may
act
only
pursuant
to
a
rule
passed
by
a
majority
of
the
judges
of
the
district
court,
as
was
done
in
this
case;
and
two,
the
duties
so
assignable
must
be
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
yes,
that’s
true
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
i
didn’t
say
that,
but
it’s
true.
these
limitations
which
i
have
just
mentioned
are
recognized
by
the
drafters
of
the
proposed
rules
governing
habeas
corpus
proceeding
which
is
presently
before
the
standing
committee
on
rules
and
practice
and
procedure
of
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states.
these
proposed
rules
give
magistrates
the
power
to
conduct
evidentiary
hearings
in
habeas
corpus
cases
citing
section
636
(b)
as
authority.
we
submit
that
allowing
us
magistrate
to
conduct
evidentiary
hearings
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
or
laws
of
united
states.
the
respondent
and
the
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
the
act
requires
your
honor
that
the
full-time
us
magistrate
should
be
a
lawyer
except
in
situations
where
they
are
not
available
in
the
districts.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
in
the
instant
case,
it
does
not,
because
our
magistrate
was
a
lawyer.
the
duty
of
appointing
the
magistrate
is
upon
the
concurrence
of
the
majority
of
the
district
judges
and
i
would
submit
that
the
judges
would
select
a
very
qualified
case
in
the
event
that
there
were
no
lawyers.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
i
have
no
statistics
on
that.
i
know
but
that
the
us
commissioner
system,
which
this
system
replaced
that
30%
were
not
lawyers.
the
respondent
in
the
sixth
circuit
denies
this
position
that
the
magistrate
act
is
inconsistent
with
the
habeas
corpus
act
in
constructing
two
statutes
unlike
service.
it
is
necessary
to
look
to
the
intent
and
purpose
of
both
acts.
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
was
to
determine
the
legality
of
the
intention
of
the
person
held
and
restraint
of
his
liberty.
now
the
intent
of
the
magistrate
act
in
respect
to
the
habeas
corpus
petitions,
it
was
clearly
that
the
intention
of
congress
to
have
magistrates
assists
the
overburdened
--
the
courts
which
are
overburdened
by
habeas
corpus
applications.
by
reviewing
habeas
corpus
applications
and
conducting
evidentiary
hearings,
if
necessary,
in
order
that
the
judge
might
have
before
him
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
petition
to
facilitate
his
ultimate
determination
of
the
fact
of
the
petition.
in
order
that
this
new
tier
of
judicial
office
which
was
created
by
the
magistrate
act
of
1968,
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
perform
this
function,
congress
upgraded
the
old
commissioner
system
not
only
in
position
but
in
the
qualifications
so
that
magistrates
would
be
qualified
to
adequately
perform
this
must
needed
assistance
to
the
judges
of
their
crowded
dockets
of
habeas
corpus
petitions.
for
this
reason,
we
submit
that
the
magistrates
act
is
consistent
with
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
actually
forces
or
supports
its
purpose
and
intent,
and
that
it
ensures
that
the
person
was
illegally
--
who
is
detained
is
getting
upon
determination
as
to
the
legality
of
his
restraint
of
his
liberty.

(3)
was
clear
that
this
was
merely
a
suggested
rather
than
a
required
duty.
therefore,
it
is
not
exclusive
on
the
subject
of
ways
on
which
the
magistrates
might
be
using
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
congress
intended
to
make
this
636
(b)
purposely
broad
and
flexible
in
order
that
the
judges
might
be
able
to
utilize
the
magistrates
to
the
efficiency
of
the
district
court.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
well,
that’s
where
within
his
providence
the
district
judge
can
accept,
reject,
demand,
or
do
what
he
wants
to
with
the
magistrates
report,
findings
of
facts,
conclusion
of
low
and
so
forth.
so
we
submit
also
that
the
magistrates
act
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution.
the
argument
has
been
made
in
respect
to
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
article
iii
vests
the
judicial
power
in
the
supreme
court
and
other
inferior
courts
as
the
district
court.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
primarily,
statutory
construction
--
i
mean
if
they
are
ever
used
in
generous
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
the
constitutional
issue
should
be
considered.
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerning
article
iii,
the
congress
stated
that
it
was
their
intention
that
the
magistrate
was
not
to
have
any
power
to
make
the
ultimate
determination
of
fact,
and
we
concede
this
point
that
the
ultimate
determination
of
fact
must
be
made
by
the
article
iii
judge
himself.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
in
this
case
there
were
no
oral
arguments.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
the
matter
was
before
the
court
on
a
petition
in
response
to
the
petition
that
came
back
on
a
sixth
circuit
on
the
first
reverse
and
remand.
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
held.
assessment
to
the
evidentiary
hearing,
our
office
can
have
copies
of
all
the
available
state
proceedings,
and
from
there,
the
judge
considered
de
novo
the
recorded
testimony,
the
available
state
records
which
were
submitted
to
the
court
and
all
the
previous
pleadings,
and
therein
he
adopted
the
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law
of
the
magistrate
as
his
own.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
i
don’t
believe
that
there
was
any
objection,
any
objection
made
by
the
party.
for
the
foregoing
reasons,
because
the
assigned
additional
duty
to
the
us
magistrate
of
conducting
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
neither
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
we
submit
that
this
may
be
done.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
that’s
true.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
he
can
consider
the
evidence
in
light
of
the
state
records,
he
gave
a
de
novo
consideration
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
to
get
before
the
court
all
the
facts
and
--
this
is
why
the
congress
set
up
the
judicial
tier
of
magistrates.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
we
submitted
that
article
iii
judges
are
vested
with
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
or
the
power
to
decide.
the
congress
upgraded
the
system
as
the
magistrates
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
they
went
far
enough
to
give
in
the
qualifications
which
would
enable
them
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
if
he
thinks
that
they
are
adequately
prepared.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
ringo
they
have
upgraded
the
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
it
was
the
intention
of
--
mr.
james
m.
ringo
it’s
his
job
to
determine
the
ultimate
fact.
the
congress
intended
to
upgrade
the
qualifications
of
magistrates
in
order
that
he
might
be
vested
with
certain
investigatory
powers,
so
to
speak,
in
order
that
he
could
facilitate
the
decision
of
the
judge,
but
the
problem
with
an
overburdened
habeas
corpus
applicants
is
the
fact
that
the
judge
does
not
have
to
run
all
the
wheat
from
the
chaff,
so
to
speak,
of
all
his
applications.
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
congress
intended
for
the
magistrate
to
be
able
to
perform.
thank
you.
