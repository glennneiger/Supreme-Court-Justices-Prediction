mr.
leonard
sarner
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
the
issue
presented
here
is
whether
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
applies
to
books
and
records
of
this
law
closely
held
partnership.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
said
that
the
court
never
directly
decided
this
issue.
in
retrospect,
i’m
satisfied
that
the
court
did
decide
it
in
the
boyd
case,
decided
in
the
favor
of
the
position
of
the
petitioner,
and
that
this
has
been
reaffirmed
by
the
formulation
which
this
court
enunciated
in
white.
the
case
is
brought
up
in
the
context
of
the
small
three-man
law
partnership.
petitioner
is
in
lawful
possession
of
the
books
and
records.
the
subpoena
is
addressed
to
him
from
the
federal
grand
jury.
thus,
we
have
here
the
ingredient
of
personal
compulsion,
which
this
court
found
lacking
in
couch.
as
a
co-owner,
rightful
possession
of
the
books,
we
submit
that
the
petitioner’s
fifth
amendment
claim
against
self-incrimination
must
be
recognized
unless
there
is
something
significantly
unique
about
the
nature
of
the
books
and
records
of
a
small
law
partnership
to
require
a
difference
in
result
and
we
also
submit
that
there
is
not
anything
unique
about
these
records.
your
honors
will
note
that
the
government
is
quick
and
perhaps,
we
think
a
little
too
quick
to
point
out
that
although
boyd
involved
a
subpoena
addressed
to
a
partnership
to
which
the
partner
responded,
the
court
says
--
the
court
according
to
the
government
says
that
this
was
ignored
by
the
boyd
court
that
this
crucial
fact,
that
the
punishable
aspect
of
the
case
was
disregarded.
now,
if
your
honors
will
note,
boyd
did
involve
a
charge
by
the
government
at
some
35
cases
of
plate
glass
had
been
imported
to
this
country
from
england
by
the
firm,
the
partnership
firm
of
e.a.
boyd
and
sons,
by
means
of
the
fraudulent
or
false
invoice.
and
the
subpoena
was
directed
to
the
partnership
providing
for
the
production
of
an
invoice
from
the
english
seller
of
this
glass
showing
the
quantity
and
quality
and
value
of
glass
contained
in
29
of
these
35
cases.
now,
the
emphasis
your
honors
by
the
boyd
court
that
a
man’s
private
papers
cannot
be
used
to
established
a
criminal
charge
against
him
where
the
private
paper
was
the
invoice
of
the
foreign
shipper.
hardly,
as
the
government
characterizes
it
in
its
brief,
a
partner’s
private
written
statements,
this
was
an
invoice
from
the
foreign
shipper,
first
indicates
and
that
the
private
papers
referred
to
in
boyd
didn’t
refer
to
the
manner
of
the
preparation
or
writing
by
the
intimacy
of
the
information
contained
therein,
but
rather
to
the
ownership
aspect.
first,
that
this
was
considered
to
be
the
private
paper
of
the
claimant
of
the
partnership
and
the
partner
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
partnership.
of
course,
as
wilson
points
out
that
was
never
required
for
fifth
amendment
privilege
that
the
documents
be
written
by
the
person
himself.
in
fact
that
in
wilson,
it
was
emphasized
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
officer
of
the
corporation
may
have
written
in
his
own
handwriting,
the
incriminating
material
in
the
corporate
books
in
no
way
would
either
enlarge
or
take
away
from
the
privilege.
but
your
honors,
we
submit
it’s
too
much
to
suggest
as
i
think
the
government
does
that
the
boyd
court
ignored
the
other
aspect
of
private
papers
which
was
involved
in
boyd.
that
is
the
private
papers’
concept
as
opposed
to
those
quasi-public
records
required
by
law
to
be
kept
for
regulatory
purposes
justifying
in
public
scrutiny
and
you
know
some
area
of
public
domain.
now,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
rationale
as
we
understand
it
for
denying
fifth
amendment
protection
to
corporate
books
and
records
lies
in
the
visitorial
powers
doctrine.
the
interest
of
the
states,
of
the
government
to
inspect
and
regulate
that
state
created
creatures
as
exemplified
merely
by
the
required
records
doctrine.
thus,
the
boyd
court
was
well
aware
what
this
court
in
hale
versus
henkel,
10
years
later,
only
10
years
later
held
about
the
required
records
doctrine
when
the
boyd
court
itself
observed
that
what
was
involved
in
boyd,
in
the
private
papers
aspect
was
completely
different
from
--
this
is
the
quotation,
“the
supervision
which
was
authorized
to
be
exercised
by
revenue
officers
over
the
manufacture
or
custody
of
excisable
articles
and
the
entries
there
open
books
required
by
law
to
be
kept
for
their
inspection.”
thus,
boyd
specifically
recognized
the
distinction
between
private
papers
of
a
partnership
and
the
required
records
of
a
corporation
with
partnership
papers
assimilated
to
privately
or
individually
owned.
furthermore
your
honors,
we
submit
that
the
white
formulation
in
essence
adopts
this
exact
approach.
now,
white
recognized
the
necessity
for
governmental
power
to
regulate
and
inspect
economically,
influential,
unincorporated
associations
such
as
the
union
involved
therein.
despite
the
non-applicability
of
the
visitorial
powers
doctrine,
the
privilege
applying
to
recast
the
white
formulation
in
the
affirmative
rather
than
in
negative
where
the
organization
has
a
character
so
personal,
that
has
been
substantially
identical,
in
scope
of
membership
and
activities,
that
it
can
be
said
to
embody
or
represent
the
purely,
private
or
personal
that
is
the
intimate
identical
interest
of
its
constituents.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
sir.
your
honor,
that
was
the
figment
of
the
imagination
of
trial
attorney
who
prepared
a
memorandum
of
law
prior
to
the
any
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
leonard
sarner
the
government’s
trial
attorney
which
was
submitted
prior
to
the
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
district
court.
the
record
as
your
honors
will
note
in
my
reply
brief
which
i
refer
to
the
citation,
the
pages
of
the
record
on
page
2
of
reply
brief
a-32,
35,
40,
a-55.
all
these
factual
allegations
were
specifically
denied.
in
fact,
in
my
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
your
honor,
i
was
trying
to
indicate
to
the
court
what
their
case
did
not
involve.
it
did
not
in
anyway
involve
a
wrongful
possession
of
books
as
opposed
to
the
other
partners.
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
addressed
itself
to
save
the
sole
issue.
and
if
you
look
at
page
15
of
the
appendix
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no
misunderstanding
whatsoever
before
the
three
partners
and
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
and
never
has
been
and
the
books
and
records
are
in
the
possession
of
mr.
bellis,
the
petitioner
with
the
blessings
and
full
blessings
of
his
other
partners.
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found
in
saying
that
the
issue
is
whether
a
partner
assumingly
in
lawful
possession
of
the
books
and
records.
mr.
leonard
sarner
we
understand
as
an
income
tax
investigation.
that
hasn’t
been
fully
disclosed
but
we
do
understand
it
to
be
an
income
tax
investigation.
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
am
stating
here
and
now
that
the
record
has
absolutely
nothing
in
it
to
justify
any
such
assumption.
and
not
only
that
your
honor,
the
district
judge,
judge
van
orsdel
(ph)
was
asked
by
the
trial
attorney
to
open
up
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury.
he
refused.
the
witnesses
were
available
to
testify.
the
government
said,
it
would
not
proceed
to
bring
any
witnesses
that
would
satisfy
to
go
on
the
record.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
you
honor,
i
would
think
that
if
one
of
the
partners
of
mr.
bellis
did
surrender
the
records
and
another
one,
mr.
kolsby
got
to
say,
“we’re
now
involved
in
a
criminal
investigation”
that
mr.
kolsby
would
not
be
able
to
claim
that
there
was
any
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
at
least
under
the
rationale
of
couch,
the
personal
compulsion
was
addressed
to
mr.
bellis.
it
wasn’t
addressed
to
one
of
the
other
partners.
so
unless
you
adopt
your
honor
may
be
referring
to
that
the
possession
was
so
constructive
or
fleeting
in
one
of
the
partners.
but
we
don’t
think
we
have
to
meet
that
problem
in
our
case.
in
our
case,
we
do
have
the
object
of
the
tax
investigation
in
rightful,
peaceful,
lawful
possession
of
the
books
and
records.
he
is
the
one
that
the
government
is
seeking
to
get
the
information
about.
he
is
the
one
who
will
be
subject
to
the
personal
compulsion
when
he
turns
them
over.
mr.
leonard
sarner
personal
possession
plus
the
rightful
possession?
personal
possession,
rightful
possession
and
the
nature
of
the
entity
being
such
that
it
is
a
private
intimate
closely
held
group.
mr.
leonard
sarner
this
may
be
open
to
some
dispute
your
honor.
as
i
understand
the
state
law
that
which
would
control
this
issue,
the
other
members
of
the
firm
have
the
right
to
inspect
the
books,
no
question
about
the
inspection.
and
so
long
as
the
books
are
in
the
designated
--
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
partners,
unless
there
was
some
rule
of
corporate
--
partnership
activity,
some
vote
of
the
majority
partners
to
take
the
books
away,
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
keep
them.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no
your
honor.
the
government
tried
to
suggest
that
the
legislative
history
of
sub-chapter
k
or
the
uniform
partnership
act
distinguishing
between
aggregate
and
entity
theory
would
be
a
fairly
controlling
portion.
we
cite
--
i
think
the
most
definitive
statement
on
this
law,
on
this
point
in
the
reply
brief,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania's
decision
in
a
d.h.
shapiro
case,
i
quoted
fully
on
page
7
and
let
me
just
read
the
last
sentence.
“we
could
multiply
authorities,
but
we
must
hold
that
the
weight
of
authority
in
this
commonwealth
is
to
the
effect
that
a
partnership
is
treated
as
an
aggregate
of
individuals
and
not
as
a
separate
entity.”
and
of
course,
on
that
point
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
i
filed
the
reply
brief.
mr.
leonard
sarner
it
was
in
file
--
it
was
filed
by
friday
within
the
time
after
i
had
received
the
government’s
brief
was
a
little
late.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
would
say,
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
one
of
the
other
partners
had
released
this,
we
would
be
faced
pretty
much
with
the
couch
type
case.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
i
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
the
point
would
be
this.
in
situations
where
somebody
else
was
in
possession
of
them,
one
or
the
other
partners
was
in
possession,
i’d
see
that
that’s
no
different
than
of
the
accountant
was
in
the
possession
of
my
papers.
he
doesn’t
waive
my
claim,
but
the
compulsion
is
directed
against
the
one
in
possession.
unless,
your
honors
feel
that
this
is
the
situation
and
we
can.
i
mean,
i
may
retrench
a
little
from
the
--
i
mentioned
to
mr.
justice
powell,
but
you
have
here
a
situation
where
possibly,
the
possession
of
someone
else
is
considered
to
be
the
rightful
possession
of
another
as
indicated
in
the
footnote.
so
that
it’s
a
form
of
constructive
possession.
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
meet
that
problem
in
this
particular
case
because
we
have
the
man
against
whom
the
subpoena
is
issued
in
possession
of
the
books
and
record.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
we
have
to
go
that
slower,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
can
refuse
for
any
reason
to
give
it
up.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
mr.
bellis
takes
the
position
that
because
there’s
an
investigation
of
one
of
his
other
partners
that
his
records,
the
partnership
records
in
his
possession
may
tend
to
incriminate
him
because
of
items
which
maybe
in
there
and
not
in
there
in
reflecting
transaction.
the
clients
i
would
definitely
say
that
the
partner
can
refuse
to
return.
mr.
leonard
sarner
they
have
whatever
weapons
are
available
against
all
taxpayers.
they
don’t
have
the
weapon
your
honor
to
make
a
taxpayer
divulge
his
purely
private
books
or
books
which
he
holds
in
a
purely
personal
capacity.
and
if
you
assume
--
let
me,
i
just
--
i
think
i
answer
your
honors’
observation.
if
you
assume
that
there
is
any
group
activity,
any
regularly
conducted
group
activity,
which
is
protected
where
the
books
and
records
are
protected,
where
two
or
more
people
are
associated
together,
then
one
of
the
members
must
be
in
possession
of
the
books
in
order
to
assert
the
privilege.
and
therefore,
if
you
assume
and
the
government
your
honor
does
assume
that
there
are
situations
where
you
can
have
group
activity,
some
association
and
the
books
and
records
are
protected
in
their
petition
--
in
their
brief
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
cert,
and
they
said
they
thought
it
might
be
the
family
partnership,
where
you
have
a
father-son
or
the
brother-sister
partnership.
they’ve
completely
discarded
that
formulation
now
and
come
up
with
the
startling
proposition
that
is
only
where
you
have
the
informal
criminal
conspiracy
where
no
one
is
said
to
own
the
books,
where
possession
is
9/10
of
the
law,
and
where
therefore
the
one
who
in
possession
of
the
these
books
in
the
criminal
conspiracy
has
as
much
claim
or
better
claim
than
the
others.
this
is
a
formulation
which
has
been
rejected
by
every
court
of
appeals
to
which
has
been
addressed
holding
that
the
books
and
records
of
narcotics
or
gambling
enterprises
are
the
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
we,
we
--
i
mean
obviously,
we
would
like
to
be
able
to
have
the
two
prongs
to
our
objection.
the
schmerber
case
suggests
by
mr.
justice
brennan
that
asking
us
to
produce
these
books
authenticates
them
and
therefore
is
the
testimony
that
these
are
the
books
required
under
the
subpoena,
and
that
therefore
this
is
the
compulsion
which
is
protected
against
by
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
say
that
that’s
the
schmerber
--
that
would
be
the
rationale
as
i
understand
it
of
schmerber
where
wouldn’t
have
testimony
or
content
of
the
books,
but
the
books
clearly
are
testimony
on
a
communicative.
so
we
think
the
contents
are
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
that’s
perfectly
true.
that
could
very
well
be.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
we’ve
made
both
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
indeed.
i
mean,
we
wrote
–
we’re
writing
primarily
--
i
would
say,
we
are
writing
primarily
the
content
of
the
books,
that
the
books
are
incriminating,
and
therefore
to
compel
us
to
bring
in
an
incriminating
material
in
the
books
violates
the
fifth
amendment
and
in
addition
of
course,
since
its
addressed
to
us
and
we
--
the
subpoena
is
addressed
to
us,
we
must
comply
and
authenticate
and
say
that
these
are
the
books
and
records
which
are
required.
then
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
that’s
yes.
that’s
the
--
what
the
government
try
to
raise
and
hill
versus
philpott
in
this
petition
for
cert
to
this
court,
and
which
was
rejected
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
hill
versus
philpott
which
i
was
think
was
cited
with
someone
who
is
approved
by
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
couch
case.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
your
honor,
my
position
is
that
there
is
no
valid
distinction
between
partnership
books,
at
least
of
the
small
closely-held
partnership
that
we
have
here,
and
individually
own
books
of
the
sole
proprietor.
now,
the
individually
owned
books
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
think
it
is.
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals
have
had
no
way
of
difficulty
with
that
concept
that
mal
brothers,
you
have
the
silverstein
case
where
you
have
limited
partners
with
60-70
limited
partners
activities
of
capitalization
of
several
millions
of
the
dollars.
you
admit
here
of
an
economically
influential
unincorporated
association.
if
your
honors
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
your
honor
because
those
documents
were
filed
prior
to
the
evidentiary
hearing.
also,
all
this
was
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
the
government’s
allegation
is
only
in
the
memorandum
of
law.
there
was
no
factual
basis
for
it
but
the
denials
are
several
your
honors,
and
they
are
specified
in
the
reply
brief.
a-32,
a-55
in
fact
we
say
that
they
the
government
haven’t
even
come
forward
with
any
suggestion
that
this
is
not
with
the
complete
consent
and
authorization
of
the
other
partners.
nothing
has
been
adduced.
you
must
find
that
that
is
so.
they
waive
their
right
to
proceed
on
a-114,
and
the
court
--
the
district
court
asked
the
government
where
they
one
of
the
procedure
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
alright,
let
me
see,
what
i
referred
to
a-32,
your
honor.
yes,
i
mean,
this
was
with
counsel.
yes,
we
denied.
this
is
the
denial
of
the
allegation.
specifically
on
a-14,
that’s
where
i
am.
yes,
the
last
paragraph
your
honor.
in
addition
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
matters
that
are
alleged
as
factual
matters
which
we
claim
are
not
correct.
mr.
leonard
sarner
it
wasn’t
a
specific
allegation.
it
was
an
memorandum
filed
before
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
a-114,
if
you
look
at
a-114.
mr.
leonard
sarner
right
beneath
--
the
last
paragraph
before
the
word
104,
before
the
104.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
nothing
has
been
adduced.
you
must
find
--
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
so
find.
they
said
they
--
the
government
was
contend
to
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
the
district
court
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
the
district
court
finds
that
they
are
in
the
possession
of
mr.
bellis
and
no
suggestion
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
no,
no
suggest
of
any
unlawful
or
wrongful
possession.
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
would
say
that
the
record
indicates
--
the
record
there
indicates
that
it
was
with
the
consent
of
the
other
partners.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
its
not
with
the
consent
of
the
other
partners
other
than
the
allegation
in
the
memorandum
filed
before
any
evidence
whatsoever
and
denied
--
is
as
factually
denied
by
counsel
the
same
as
the
allegation
was
made
by
counsel.
no
testimonies
brought
in
the
government
refuse
to
do
so.
that
men
were
available,
they
refused
to
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
oh,
yes.
i
think
we
do.
we
thought
we
did
maybe
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
you
must
--
what
i
say,
you
must
find
that
this
is
so.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
--
we
meant
to.
maybe
we
are
a
little
inartistic
then
and
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
i’m
sorry.
i
didn’t
mean
to
be
that.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
it
doesn’t
open
the
way
to
a
complete
closure
of
any
partnership
books.
it
opens
the
way
that
the
complete
closure
of
partnership
books
which
are
small
closely-held
partnership
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
partners,
just
like
the
individual
books
of
the
sole
proprietor.
mr.
leonard
sarner
if
the
books
are
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
partners,
and
if
it’s
an
intimate
close
relationship,
just
as
this
law
partnership
is,
then
the
books
are
protected
from
scrutiny
by
subpoena.
the
same
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
if
they
are
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
partners.
mr.
leonard
sarner
from
the
--
no,
i
was
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
i
assume
that
he
can
get
them
from
mr.
bellis.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
your
honor,
what
you’re
asking
me
to
speculate
on
is
the
fact
that
once
you
have
two
people
associated
in
some
joint
enterprise,
you
can
never
have
any
fifth
amendment
protection.
i
don’t
think
that’s
how
i
think
that
what
you
have
here
is
the
situation
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
of
the
partners
is
entitled
to
get
them
from
the
other
partner
in
no
way
means
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
get
them
from
the
other
partner.
and
it’s
never
been
equated
to
the
fact
that
because
there
are
other
ways
that
the
material
can
be
obtained,
that
therefore
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
doesn’t
apply
with
the
one
in
possession.
may
i
just
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
it
would
indeed
and
i
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
think
then
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
that’s
right,
and
the
government’s
suggestion
that
schmerber
means
just
that
very
thing
would
actually
protect
corporate
books
and
records
from
being
introduced.
that’s
why
i
think
the
content
is
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
being
subject
to
a
subpoena.
mr.
leonard
sarner
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
the
issue
presented
here
is
whether
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
applies
to
books
and
records
of
this
law
closely
held
partnership.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
said
that
the
court
never
directly
decided
this
issue.
in
retrospect,
i’m
satisfied
that
the
court
did
decide
it
in
the
boyd
case,
decided
in
the
favor
of
the
position
of
the
petitioner,
and
that
this
has
been
reaffirmed
by
the
formulation
which
this
court
enunciated
in
white.
the
case
is
brought
up
in
the
context
of
the
small
three-man
law
partnership.
petitioner
is
in
lawful
possession
of
the
books
and
records.
the
subpoena
is
addressed
to
him
from
the
federal
grand
jury.
thus,
we
have
here
the
ingredient
of
personal
compulsion,
which
this
court
found
lacking
in
couch.
as
a
co-owner,
rightful
possession
of
the
books,
we
submit
that
the
petitioner’s
fifth
amendment
claim
against
self-incrimination
must
be
recognized
unless
there
is
something
significantly
unique
about
the
nature
of
the
books
and
records
of
a
small
law
partnership
to
require
a
difference
in
result
and
we
also
submit
that
there
is
not
anything
unique
about
these
records.
your
honors
will
note
that
the
government
is
quick
and
perhaps,
we
think
a
little
too
quick
to
point
out
that
although
boyd
involved
a
subpoena
addressed
to
a
partnership
to
which
the
partner
responded,
the
court
says
--
the
court
according
to
the
government
says
that
this
was
ignored
by
the
boyd
court
that
this
crucial
fact,
that
the
punishable
aspect
of
the
case
was
disregarded.
now,
if
your
honors
will
note,
boyd
did
involve
a
charge
by
the
government
at
some
35
cases
of
plate
glass
had
been
imported
to
this
country
from
england
by
the
firm,
the
partnership
firm
of
e.a.
boyd
and
sons,
by
means
of
the
fraudulent
or
false
invoice.
and
the
subpoena
was
directed
to
the
partnership
providing
for
the
production
of
an
invoice
from
the
english
seller
of
this
glass
showing
the
quantity
and
quality
and
value
of
glass
contained
in
29
of
these
35
cases.
now,
the
emphasis
your
honors
by
the
boyd
court
that
a
man’s
private
papers
cannot
be
used
to
established
a
criminal
charge
against
him
where
the
private
paper
was
the
invoice
of
the
foreign
shipper.
hardly,
as
the
government
characterizes
it
in
its
brief,
a
partner’s
private
written
statements,
this
was
an
invoice
from
the
foreign
shipper,
first
indicates
and
that
the
private
papers
referred
to
in
boyd
didn’t
refer
to
the
manner
of
the
preparation
or
writing
by
the
intimacy
of
the
information
contained
therein,
but
rather
to
the
ownership
aspect.
first,
that
this
was
considered
to
be
the
private
paper
of
the
claimant
of
the
partnership
and
the
partner
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
partnership.
of
course,
as
wilson
points
out
that
was
never
required
for
fifth
amendment
privilege
that
the
documents
be
written
by
the
person
himself.
in
fact
that
in
wilson,
it
was
emphasized
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
officer
of
the
corporation
may
have
written
in
his
own
handwriting,
the
incriminating
material
in
the
corporate
books
in
no
way
would
either
enlarge
or
take
away
from
the
privilege.
but
your
honors,
we
submit
it’s
too
much
to
suggest
as
i
think
the
government
does
that
the
boyd
court
ignored
the
other
aspect
of
private
papers
which
was
involved
in
boyd.
that
is
the
private
papers’
concept
as
opposed
to
those
quasi-public
records
required
by
law
to
be
kept
for
regulatory
purposes
justifying
in
public
scrutiny
and
you
know
some
area
of
public
domain.
now,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
rationale
as
we
understand
it
for
denying
fifth
amendment
protection
to
corporate
books
and
records
lies
in
the
visitorial
powers
doctrine.
the
interest
of
the
states,
of
the
government
to
inspect
and
regulate
that
state
created
creatures
as
exemplified
merely
by
the
required
records
doctrine.
thus,
the
boyd
court
was
well
aware
what
this
court
in
hale
versus
henkel,
10
years
later,
only
10
years
later
held
about
the
required
records
doctrine
when
the
boyd
court
itself
observed
that
what
was
involved
in
boyd,
in
the
private
papers
aspect
was
completely
different
from
--
this
is
the
quotation,
“the
supervision
which
was
authorized
to
be
exercised
by
revenue
officers
over
the
manufacture
or
custody
of
excisable
articles
and
the
entries
there
open
books
required
by
law
to
be
kept
for
their
inspection.”
thus,
boyd
specifically
recognized
the
distinction
between
private
papers
of
a
partnership
and
the
required
records
of
a
corporation
with
partnership
papers
assimilated
to
privately
or
individually
owned.
furthermore
your
honors,
we
submit
that
the
white
formulation
in
essence
adopts
this
exact
approach.
now,
white
recognized
the
necessity
for
governmental
power
to
regulate
and
inspect
economically,
influential,
unincorporated
associations
such
as
the
union
involved
therein.
despite
the
non-applicability
of
the
visitorial
powers
doctrine,
the
privilege
applying
to
recast
the
white
formulation
in
the
affirmative
rather
than
in
negative
where
the
organization
has
a
character
so
personal,
that
has
been
substantially
identical,
in
scope
of
membership
and
activities,
that
it
can
be
said
to
embody
or
represent
the
purely,
private
or
personal
that
is
the
intimate
identical
interest
of
its
constituents.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
sir.
your
honor,
that
was
the
figment
of
the
imagination
of
trial
attorney
who
prepared
a
memorandum
of
law
prior
to
the
any
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
leonard
sarner
the
government’s
trial
attorney
which
was
submitted
prior
to
the
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
district
court.
the
record
as
your
honors
will
note
in
my
reply
brief
which
i
refer
to
the
citation,
the
pages
of
the
record
on
page
2
of
reply
brief
a-32,
35,
40,
a-55.
all
these
factual
allegations
were
specifically
denied.
in
fact,
in
my
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
your
honor,
i
was
trying
to
indicate
to
the
court
what
their
case
did
not
involve.
it
did
not
in
anyway
involve
a
wrongful
possession
of
books
as
opposed
to
the
other
partners.
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
addressed
itself
to
save
the
sole
issue.
and
if
you
look
at
page
15
of
the
appendix
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no
misunderstanding
whatsoever
before
the
three
partners
and
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
and
never
has
been
and
the
books
and
records
are
in
the
possession
of
mr.
bellis,
the
petitioner
with
the
blessings
and
full
blessings
of
his
other
partners.
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found
in
saying
that
the
issue
is
whether
a
partner
assumingly
in
lawful
possession
of
the
books
and
records.
mr.
leonard
sarner
we
understand
as
an
income
tax
investigation.
that
hasn’t
been
fully
disclosed
but
we
do
understand
it
to
be
an
income
tax
investigation.
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
am
stating
here
and
now
that
the
record
has
absolutely
nothing
in
it
to
justify
any
such
assumption.
and
not
only
that
your
honor,
the
district
judge,
judge
van
orsdel
(ph)
was
asked
by
the
trial
attorney
to
open
up
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury.
he
refused.
the
witnesses
were
available
to
testify.
the
government
said,
it
would
not
proceed
to
bring
any
witnesses
that
would
satisfy
to
go
on
the
record.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
you
honor,
i
would
think
that
if
one
of
the
partners
of
mr.
bellis
did
surrender
the
records
and
another
one,
mr.
kolsby
got
to
say,
“we’re
now
involved
in
a
criminal
investigation”
that
mr.
kolsby
would
not
be
able
to
claim
that
there
was
any
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
at
least
under
the
rationale
of
couch,
the
personal
compulsion
was
addressed
to
mr.
bellis.
it
wasn’t
addressed
to
one
of
the
other
partners.
so
unless
you
adopt
your
honor
may
be
referring
to
that
the
possession
was
so
constructive
or
fleeting
in
one
of
the
partners.
but
we
don’t
think
we
have
to
meet
that
problem
in
our
case.
in
our
case,
we
do
have
the
object
of
the
tax
investigation
in
rightful,
peaceful,
lawful
possession
of
the
books
and
records.
he
is
the
one
that
the
government
is
seeking
to
get
the
information
about.
he
is
the
one
who
will
be
subject
to
the
personal
compulsion
when
he
turns
them
over.
mr.
leonard
sarner
personal
possession
plus
the
rightful
possession?
personal
possession,
rightful
possession
and
the
nature
of
the
entity
being
such
that
it
is
a
private
intimate
closely
held
group.
mr.
leonard
sarner
this
may
be
open
to
some
dispute
your
honor.
as
i
understand
the
state
law
that
which
would
control
this
issue,
the
other
members
of
the
firm
have
the
right
to
inspect
the
books,
no
question
about
the
inspection.
and
so
long
as
the
books
are
in
the
designated
--
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
partners,
unless
there
was
some
rule
of
corporate
--
partnership
activity,
some
vote
of
the
majority
partners
to
take
the
books
away,
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
keep
them.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no
your
honor.
the
government
tried
to
suggest
that
the
legislative
history
of
sub-chapter
k
or
the
uniform
partnership
act
distinguishing
between
aggregate
and
entity
theory
would
be
a
fairly
controlling
portion.
we
cite
--
i
think
the
most
definitive
statement
on
this
law,
on
this
point
in
the
reply
brief,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania's
decision
in
a
d.h.
shapiro
case,
i
quoted
fully
on
page
7
and
let
me
just
read
the
last
sentence.
“we
could
multiply
authorities,
but
we
must
hold
that
the
weight
of
authority
in
this
commonwealth
is
to
the
effect
that
a
partnership
is
treated
as
an
aggregate
of
individuals
and
not
as
a
separate
entity.”
and
of
course,
on
that
point
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
i
filed
the
reply
brief.
mr.
leonard
sarner
it
was
in
file
--
it
was
filed
by
friday
within
the
time
after
i
had
received
the
government’s
brief
was
a
little
late.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
would
say,
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
one
of
the
other
partners
had
released
this,
we
would
be
faced
pretty
much
with
the
couch
type
case.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
i
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
the
point
would
be
this.
in
situations
where
somebody
else
was
in
possession
of
them,
one
or
the
other
partners
was
in
possession,
i’d
see
that
that’s
no
different
than
of
the
accountant
was
in
the
possession
of
my
papers.
he
doesn’t
waive
my
claim,
but
the
compulsion
is
directed
against
the
one
in
possession.
unless,
your
honors
feel
that
this
is
the
situation
and
we
can.
i
mean,
i
may
retrench
a
little
from
the
--
i
mentioned
to
mr.
justice
powell,
but
you
have
here
a
situation
where
possibly,
the
possession
of
someone
else
is
considered
to
be
the
rightful
possession
of
another
as
indicated
in
the
footnote.
so
that
it’s
a
form
of
constructive
possession.
i
don’t
think
we
have
to
meet
that
problem
in
this
particular
case
because
we
have
the
man
against
whom
the
subpoena
is
issued
in
possession
of
the
books
and
record.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
we
have
to
go
that
slower,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
can
refuse
for
any
reason
to
give
it
up.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
mr.
bellis
takes
the
position
that
because
there’s
an
investigation
of
one
of
his
other
partners
that
his
records,
the
partnership
records
in
his
possession
may
tend
to
incriminate
him
because
of
items
which
maybe
in
there
and
not
in
there
in
reflecting
transaction.
the
clients
i
would
definitely
say
that
the
partner
can
refuse
to
return.
mr.
leonard
sarner
they
have
whatever
weapons
are
available
against
all
taxpayers.
they
don’t
have
the
weapon
your
honor
to
make
a
taxpayer
divulge
his
purely
private
books
or
books
which
he
holds
in
a
purely
personal
capacity.
and
if
you
assume
--
let
me,
i
just
--
i
think
i
answer
your
honors’
observation.
if
you
assume
that
there
is
any
group
activity,
any
regularly
conducted
group
activity,
which
is
protected
where
the
books
and
records
are
protected,
where
two
or
more
people
are
associated
together,
then
one
of
the
members
must
be
in
possession
of
the
books
in
order
to
assert
the
privilege.
and
therefore,
if
you
assume
and
the
government
your
honor
does
assume
that
there
are
situations
where
you
can
have
group
activity,
some
association
and
the
books
and
records
are
protected
in
their
petition
--
in
their
brief
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
cert,
and
they
said
they
thought
it
might
be
the
family
partnership,
where
you
have
a
father-son
or
the
brother-sister
partnership.
they’ve
completely
discarded
that
formulation
now
and
come
up
with
the
startling
proposition
that
is
only
where
you
have
the
informal
criminal
conspiracy
where
no
one
is
said
to
own
the
books,
where
possession
is
9/10
of
the
law,
and
where
therefore
the
one
who
in
possession
of
the
these
books
in
the
criminal
conspiracy
has
as
much
claim
or
better
claim
than
the
others.
this
is
a
formulation
which
has
been
rejected
by
every
court
of
appeals
to
which
has
been
addressed
holding
that
the
books
and
records
of
narcotics
or
gambling
enterprises
are
the
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
we,
we
--
i
mean
obviously,
we
would
like
to
be
able
to
have
the
two
prongs
to
our
objection.
the
schmerber
case
suggests
by
mr.
justice
brennan
that
asking
us
to
produce
these
books
authenticates
them
and
therefore
is
the
testimony
that
these
are
the
books
required
under
the
subpoena,
and
that
therefore
this
is
the
compulsion
which
is
protected
against
by
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
say
that
that’s
the
schmerber
--
that
would
be
the
rationale
as
i
understand
it
of
schmerber
where
wouldn’t
have
testimony
or
content
of
the
books,
but
the
books
clearly
are
testimony
on
a
communicative.
so
we
think
the
contents
are
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
that’s
perfectly
true.
that
could
very
well
be.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
we’ve
made
both
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
indeed.
i
mean,
we
wrote
–
we’re
writing
primarily
--
i
would
say,
we
are
writing
primarily
the
content
of
the
books,
that
the
books
are
incriminating,
and
therefore
to
compel
us
to
bring
in
an
incriminating
material
in
the
books
violates
the
fifth
amendment
and
in
addition
of
course,
since
its
addressed
to
us
and
we
--
the
subpoena
is
addressed
to
us,
we
must
comply
and
authenticate
and
say
that
these
are
the
books
and
records
which
are
required.
then
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
that’s
yes.
that’s
the
--
what
the
government
try
to
raise
and
hill
versus
philpott
in
this
petition
for
cert
to
this
court,
and
which
was
rejected
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
hill
versus
philpott
which
i
was
think
was
cited
with
someone
who
is
approved
by
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
couch
case.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
your
honor,
my
position
is
that
there
is
no
valid
distinction
between
partnership
books,
at
least
of
the
small
closely-held
partnership
that
we
have
here,
and
individually
own
books
of
the
sole
proprietor.
now,
the
individually
owned
books
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
think
it
is.
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals
have
had
no
way
of
difficulty
with
that
concept
that
mal
brothers,
you
have
the
silverstein
case
where
you
have
limited
partners
with
60-70
limited
partners
activities
of
capitalization
of
several
millions
of
the
dollars.
you
admit
here
of
an
economically
influential
unincorporated
association.
if
your
honors
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
your
honor
because
those
documents
were
filed
prior
to
the
evidentiary
hearing.
also,
all
this
was
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
the
government’s
allegation
is
only
in
the
memorandum
of
law.
there
was
no
factual
basis
for
it
but
the
denials
are
several
your
honors,
and
they
are
specified
in
the
reply
brief.
a-32,
a-55
in
fact
we
say
that
they
the
government
haven’t
even
come
forward
with
any
suggestion
that
this
is
not
with
the
complete
consent
and
authorization
of
the
other
partners.
nothing
has
been
adduced.
you
must
find
that
that
is
so.
they
waive
their
right
to
proceed
on
a-114,
and
the
court
--
the
district
court
asked
the
government
where
they
one
of
the
procedure
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
alright,
let
me
see,
what
i
referred
to
a-32,
your
honor.
yes,
i
mean,
this
was
with
counsel.
yes,
we
denied.
this
is
the
denial
of
the
allegation.
specifically
on
a-14,
that’s
where
i
am.
yes,
the
last
paragraph
your
honor.
in
addition
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
matters
that
are
alleged
as
factual
matters
which
we
claim
are
not
correct.
mr.
leonard
sarner
it
wasn’t
a
specific
allegation.
it
was
an
memorandum
filed
before
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
a-114,
if
you
look
at
a-114.
mr.
leonard
sarner
right
beneath
--
the
last
paragraph
before
the
word
104,
before
the
104.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
nothing
has
been
adduced.
you
must
find
--
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
so
find.
they
said
they
--
the
government
was
contend
to
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
the
district
court
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
the
district
court
finds
that
they
are
in
the
possession
of
mr.
bellis
and
no
suggestion
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
no,
no
suggest
of
any
unlawful
or
wrongful
possession.
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
would
say
that
the
record
indicates
--
the
record
there
indicates
that
it
was
with
the
consent
of
the
other
partners.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
its
not
with
the
consent
of
the
other
partners
other
than
the
allegation
in
the
memorandum
filed
before
any
evidence
whatsoever
and
denied
--
is
as
factually
denied
by
counsel
the
same
as
the
allegation
was
made
by
counsel.
no
testimonies
brought
in
the
government
refuse
to
do
so.
that
men
were
available,
they
refused
to
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
oh,
yes.
i
think
we
do.
we
thought
we
did
maybe
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
you
must
--
what
i
say,
you
must
find
that
this
is
so.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
--
we
meant
to.
maybe
we
are
a
little
inartistic
then
and
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
i’m
sorry.
i
didn’t
mean
to
be
that.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
it
doesn’t
open
the
way
to
a
complete
closure
of
any
partnership
books.
it
opens
the
way
that
the
complete
closure
of
partnership
books
which
are
small
closely-held
partnership
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
partners,
just
like
the
individual
books
of
the
sole
proprietor.
mr.
leonard
sarner
if
the
books
are
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
partners,
and
if
it’s
an
intimate
close
relationship,
just
as
this
law
partnership
is,
then
the
books
are
protected
from
scrutiny
by
subpoena.
the
same
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
if
they
are
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
partners.
mr.
leonard
sarner
from
the
--
no,
i
was
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
i
assume
that
he
can
get
them
from
mr.
bellis.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
your
honor,
what
you’re
asking
me
to
speculate
on
is
the
fact
that
once
you
have
two
people
associated
in
some
joint
enterprise,
you
can
never
have
any
fifth
amendment
protection.
i
don’t
think
that’s
how
i
think
that
what
you
have
here
is
the
situation
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
of
the
partners
is
entitled
to
get
them
from
the
other
partner
in
no
way
means
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
get
them
from
the
other
partner.
and
it’s
never
been
equated
to
the
fact
that
because
there
are
other
ways
that
the
material
can
be
obtained,
that
therefore
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
doesn’t
apply
with
the
one
in
possession.
may
i
just
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
it
would
indeed
and
i
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
think
then
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
that’s
right,
and
the
government’s
suggestion
that
schmerber
means
just
that
very
thing
would
actually
protect
corporate
books
and
records
from
being
introduced.
that’s
why
i
think
the
content
is
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
being
subject
to
a
subpoena.
