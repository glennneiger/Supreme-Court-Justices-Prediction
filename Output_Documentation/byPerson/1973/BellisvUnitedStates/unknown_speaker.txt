unknown
speaker
mr.
sarner,
at
one
time,
mr.
kolsby
and
mr.
wolf
had
consented
to
the
production
of
the
records,
have
they
not?
unknown
speaker
who’s
trail
attorney?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
stating
now
that
there
is
no
misunderstanding
or
whatsoever
between
the
three
former
partners?
unknown
speaker
and
never
has
been?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
there
was
never
any
question
about
he
is
being
in
lawful
possession.
i
think
the
others
as
i
read
the
record.
tell
me
one
other
thing,
what
is
this
investigation
all
about,
is
it
an
income
tax
investigation?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
stating
here
now,
there
is
no
--
between
the
three
former
partners.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarner?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
mr.
bellis
had
voluntarily
surrendered
the
records
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
subsequently,
one
of
his
other
partners
had
been
prosecuted
in
a
tax
fraud
case.
what
position
would
he
have
had
with
respect
to
claiming
the
fifth
amendment
if
the
records
were
introduced?
unknown
speaker
on
your
submission,
the
critical
fact
is
that
personal
possession
by
mr.
bellis
of
these
records.
unknown
speaker
does
every
member
of
the
law
firm
have
the
rightful
possession
to
the
records
of
the
firm
as
against
other
members
of
the
firm?
unknown
speaker
does
pennsylvania
have
any
entity
theory
of
--
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
reply
brief?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
object
to
the
admissibility
of
the
contents,
the
records
or
are
you
objecting
to
your
having
to
produce
them
and
by
the
act
of
producing
them,
you
verify
and
identify
--
unknown
speaker
even
if
otherwise
they
would
be
admissible
and
not
subject
to.
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
that
if
the
books
were
otherwise
before
the
grand
jury,
they
would
be
admissible
over
your
fifth
amendment
objection,
and
still,
you
would
have
the
fifth
amendment
objection,
do
you
yourself
produce
it?
unknown
speaker
where
which
you
--
unknown
speaker
are
you
riding
both
horses
here?
unknown
speaker
but
now
the
latter
--
the
latter,
the
objection
to
producing
that
yourself
would
be
obviated
if
there
were
say
a
search
warrant
and
the
books
were
seized
in
your
house
--
in
your
client’s
house
and
taken
to
court,
then
you
would
be
left
with
one,
it’s
then
one
objection?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarner,
does
your
position
mean
or
suggest
a
way
then
to
make
partnership
books
completely
inaccessible?
get
them
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
partners?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
define
a
small
closely-held
partnerships
on
three-man
partnerships
are
pretty
substantial?
is
that
a
factor?
unknown
speaker
so,
on
a-32
for
example,
scanning
at
which,
i
don’t
see
anything
there,
and
i
perhaps,
i’m
overlooking
something.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
is
that
your
way
of
traversing
a
specific
allegation?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
was
a
very
specific
allegation.
let
me
read
it
to
you.
“authorization
was
given
by
mr.
herbert
f.
kolsby
and
edward
l
wolf
on
behalf
of
kolsby
and
wolf
for
the
federal
grand
jury
to
examine
those
records.”
now,
do
you
anywhere
in
the
appendix
specifically
deny
that?
unknown
speaker
where
about
in
a-114?
unknown
speaker
where
you
say
they
haven’t
even
come
forward
with
any
suggestion
that
this
is
not
with
the
complete
consent
and
authorization
of
other
person?
unknown
speaker
where
did
the
court
find
that
it
was
with
the
consent
or
without
the
consent
of
the
other
party?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
mean
to
make
you
--
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
you’ll
find
in
there
in
that
possession
--
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
i
don’t
think
justice
blackmun’s
question
was
addressed
to
the
issue
of
wrongful
possession.
i
think
his
question
was
addressed
to
the
consent
of
the
other
partners.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
a-114,
all
you
say
is
the
government
hasn’t
come
forward
with
any
evidence.
you
don’t
deny
that
it's
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
you’re
referring
to
us
a
statement
in
a114.
you
say,
“they
haven’t
even
come
forward
with
any
suggestion
that
this
is
not
with
the
complete
--”
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
say
its
not
so.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you’re
a
little
inartistic
in
answering
justice
blackmun’s
question.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
think
it’s
not
been
asked
that
is,
whether
your
posture
here
opens
the
way
to
a
complete
closure
of
any
partnership
books
in
any
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
the
way
then
to
put
the
books
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
partners?
unknown
speaker
then
i
ask
you
again,
and
i
still
get
a
negative
answer
from
you.
i
ask
again,
does
this
not
open
the
way
to
a
complete
barring
of
partnership
books
to
any
investigation?
unknown
speaker
the
fact
that
--
the
fact
that
you
must
be
able
to
get
objective
producing
because
it
authenticates
the
records,
that
wouldn’t
be
distinctive
of
partnership
books,
it
would
be
of
any
kind
of
the
record
in
your
possession?
unknown
speaker
not
just
of
partnership
one
but
a
corporation
--
unknown
speaker
friend
or
anybody?
unknown
speaker
is
this
protected
against
being
introduced?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
case?
unknown
speaker
didn’t
the
court
hold
really
that
a
corporation
didn’t
have
any
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self
incrimination?
unknown
speaker
right,
so
that
wholly
different
--
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
was
given
immunity?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you’re
talking
about
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn’t
suggest
that
however
that
the
--
whether
you’re
obligated
to
produce
that
or
not
--
at
a
criminal
trial,
the
defendant
could
be
called
to
the
stand
to
identify
these
records
that
he’s
produced.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
respond
to
a
subpoena
and
produce
records
that
are
described
in
such
and
such
a
way.
aren’t
you
authenticating
them
with
that
respect?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
that
support
with
wilson?
don’t
you
say
wilson
holds
that?
unknown
speaker
when
the
couch
case
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
interrupt
you
mr.
wallace,
in
the
couch
case,
was
there
any
suggestion
that
the
records
in
that
case
would
have
been
producible
if
there
had
been
the
accountant
who
was
asserting
the
fifth
amendment
privilege?
unknown
speaker
he
was
the
custodian
of
the
records,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
there’s
no
suggestion
that
case
that
the
--
that
he
could
not
have
asserted
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
and
--
unknown
speaker
because
they
were
in
the
possession
of
somebody
else
--
unknown
speaker
--the
accountant,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
had
the
accountant
been
asserting
that
privilege,
his
personal
privilege
there
would
have
been
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
securing
them
properly?
that’s
the
question
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
to
whom
did
the
subpoena
run
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
to
whom
that
the
subpoena
run
in
the
wilson
case?
unknown
speaker
it
ran
to
the
corporation.
unknown
speaker
if
you
got
a
subpoena
of
the
records,
you
have
got
to
serve
some
person
you
just
can’t
serve
the
corporation.
unknown
speaker
and
whoever
you
serve,
whoever
is
that
custody,
the
corporate
papers,
has
to
produce
them.
unknown
speaker
are
the
subpoena
that
white
case
was
directed
to
local
number
542
international
union
of
operating
engineers?
what
do
you
suppose
the
court
meant
by
setting
of
that
test,
so
called
test
in
the
white
case,
when
it
is
a
catastrophe
--
unknown
speaker
applied
in
the
white
case?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
the
couch
case,
wouldn’t
it?
you
wouldn’t
need
to
have
this
partnership
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
well,
probably
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
the
custodian
who’s
making
the
claim,
and
then
that
would
be
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i
take
it
if
mr.
bellis
have
gotten
these
records
and
thrown
them
in
the
river,
and
they
were
then
subpoenaed.
he
was
subpoenaed
for
grand
jury
as
to
produce
him.
he
said,
he
didn’t
have
them,
and
then,
he
was
asked
what
you
do
with
them.
under
curcio,
he
would
have
the
right
to
plead
self-incrimination
there,
wouldn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
you,
you
have
suggested
limitation
of
the
white
test,
what’s
the
example
of
an
associational
relationship
with
respect
to
which
the
law
recognizes
testimonial
privileges?
unknown
speaker
do
you
conceive
of
any
connection
with
the
partnership
of
this
type?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
very
limited.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sarner,
at
one
time,
mr.
kolsby
and
mr.
wolf
had
consented
to
the
production
of
the
records,
have
they
not?
unknown
speaker
who’s
trail
attorney?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
stating
now
that
there
is
no
misunderstanding
or
whatsoever
between
the
three
former
partners?
unknown
speaker
and
never
has
been?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
there
was
never
any
question
about
he
is
being
in
lawful
possession.
i
think
the
others
as
i
read
the
record.
tell
me
one
other
thing,
what
is
this
investigation
all
about,
is
it
an

investigation?

but
you

now,
there
is
no

mr.

service

case.
what
position
would
he

were

unknown
speaker
on

the

is
that

mr.

in

was

in

there’s

that
the

that
he
could
not
have
asserted
the
fifth

is
there?
unknown

and
--

because
they
were

there

had
the

his
personal

would

unknown

this
is

that’s
the
question
in

unknown

to

run
in

it
ran
to
the

if

you
have

some

i
take
it
if
mr.

have
gotten
these

and
they

then
subpoenaed.
he

said,
he
didn’t
have
them,
and
then,
he
was
asked
what
you
do
with
them.
under
curcio,
he
would
have
the
right
to
plead
self-incrimination
there,
wouldn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
you,
you
have
suggested
limitation
of
the
white
test,
what’s
the
example
of
an
associational
relationship
with
respect
to
which
the
law
recognizes
testimonial
privileges?
unknown
speaker
do
you
conceive
of
any
connection
with
the
partnership
of
this
type?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
very
limited.
