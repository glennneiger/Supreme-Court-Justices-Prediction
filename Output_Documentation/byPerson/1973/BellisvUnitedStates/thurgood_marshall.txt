justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
mr.
wallace
that
he
says
that
while
he
is
the
custodian
of
these
records,
these
records
would
incriminate
him
personally?
that’s
his
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
it
seems
to
me
that
here
--
there’s
no
showing
of
criminality
at
all,
yet,
right?
it’s
just
an
investigation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
suppose
he
has
two
sets
of
records,
one
are
his
personal
records
and
the
other
are
his
records
in
relationship
to
the
partnership.
does
he
have
to
produce
all
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
good,
next
case.
he
says
there
is
so
entwined
together,
i
can’t
separate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
partner
say,
i
can’t
let
you
have
this
because
if
i
let
you
have
it,
you’ll
take
it
to
the
authority
and
i’ll
end
up
in
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
no
either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
not
too
sure
boyd
covers
this
personal
complaint
he
has
that
these
papers
are
the
one
that’s
been
doing
the
dirty
work
here.
and
i’m
the
one
that’s
messed
with
the
books
and
everything
else.
so,
i
can’t
come
loose
because
they’ll
send
me
to
jail
for
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn’t
extend
to
be
huge
partnerships
to
have
200
or
300
partners
you
would
--
you
wouldn’t
extend
it
there,
you
say
you
are
limited.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
what
the
appellants
says
and
of
course,
it’s
true
that
when
they
use
partnerships,
that
we
have
a
small
partnership
is
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
originally
said
that
family,
of
course
would
be
very
little
problem
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
wouldn’t
have
no
difference
as
to
how
small
the
partnership
was
or
how
intimate
it
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
don’t
base
it
on
the
numbers
alone.
you
base
on
the
nature
of
the
partners.

in

bellis
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
in
the
case,
the
petitioner
is
partner
in
the
small
law
firm,
performing
as
three
partner
and
six
other
employees
including
two
other
attorneys.
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
to
produce
the
partnership
financial
record
before
federal
grand
jury.
he
refused,
relying
on
what
he
called
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrementation.
after
hearing,
the
district
court
held,
the
petitioner
could
not
rely
on
his
personal
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
refuse
to
produce
the
records
of
the
partnership.
petitioner
still
refused
to
produce
the
records.
the
district
court
held
him
in
contempts,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
considered
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
our
decisions
which
have
established
that
the
personal
privilege
against
self
incrementation
cannot
be
relied
on
by
the
custodian
of
the
records
of
an
organization
to
justify
the
refusal
to
produce
the
organizational
records
held
in
representative
capacity.
this
rule
had
been
applied
to
corporations,
labor
union,
other
organizational
entities,
and
we
no
reason
and
why
it
should
not
be
applicable
to
partnerships
as
well.
while
the
partnership
was
small,
we
find
that
it
did
have
recognized
existence
of
his
own
apart
from
tis
individual
members
and
that
the
petitioner
was
holding
the
partnership
financial
records
in
a
representative
capacity.
accordingly,
for
the
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
