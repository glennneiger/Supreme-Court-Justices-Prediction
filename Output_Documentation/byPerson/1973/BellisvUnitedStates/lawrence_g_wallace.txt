mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
records
at
issue
here
are
the
financial
records
of
a
law
partnership.
the
production
order
which
is
set
forth
on
page
116
of
the
appendix
excludes
any
individual
client
files
containing
any
advice
or
confidential
relationships
between
the
attorney
and
the
client.
there
essentially
--
essentially,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
production
order
enforcing
a
grand
jury
subpoena
for
the
financial
records
of
the
partnership,
the
receipts
and
disbursements
record
of
that
kind.
the
claim
is
that
the
partner
in
possession
is
entitled
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment
claim
that
this
would
violate
the
provision
stating
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
at
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
this
is
a
provision,
the
background
of
which
has
been
reviewed
by
the
court
many
times
in
recent
years.
last
term
in
the
couch
opinion,
the
court
noted
that
historically,
the
privilege
was
to
protect
the
individual
from
resort
by
the
state
to
the
expedient
of
compelling
incriminating
evidence
from
the
individuals
on
mouth
as
the
court
put
it
in
couch.
and
in
light
of
the
language
of
the
amendment
and
its
historical
background,
the
view
has
been
expressed
by
members
of
the
court,
including
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
perhaps
the
privilege
might
have
been
intended
to
be
restricted
to
the
protection
of
the
testimony
and
judicial
proceedings,
and
only
to
bar
the
compulsion
of
testimony.
but
in
the
boyd
case
in
116
u.s.,
the
court
did
extend
the
privilege
also
to
the
compulsion
of
the
production
of
a
person’s
papers
in
his
possession.
now,
it
was
only
the
issue
in
boyd
didn’t
--
the
parties
in
boyd
and
the
court
in
boyd
didn’t
address
the
problem
of
the
relationship
between
an
individual
and
an
association
or
a
group
with
whom
he
was
related.
the
entire
issue
was
whether
the
privilege
would
be
extended
beyond
testimonial
compulsion.
and
as
the
court
noted
in
the
shapiro
case,
the
government
in
essence
contended
that
the
privilege
didn’t
extend
to
in
rem
proceedings
of
any
kind
that
it
only
extended
to
in
personam
proceedings.
but
the
fact
that
these
were
partnership
records
in
the
boyd
case
simply
wasn’t
discussed
either
by
the
parties
or
in
the
court’s
opinion
which
treated
them
as
mr.
boyd’s
personal
papers
and
several
times
in
the
principle
passages
of
the
boyd
opinion.
the
court
referred
to
these
as
personal
papers
as
it
has
insubsequently
referring
to
the
boyd
holding
in
united
states
against
white
and
also
in
the
couch
case
last
term.
it
was
only
after
boyd
was
decided
and
the
privilege
was
thus
extended
that
the
issue
arose
as
to
the
records
of
entities
other
than
natural
individuals
and
the
rights
of
individuals
who
are
parts
of
those
entities.
and
throughout
that
entire
series
of
cases,
the
court
has
been
very
conscious
of
the
basic
concept
that’s
implicit
in
the
history
of
the
amendment,
and
that
was
also
restated
last
term
in
the
couch
case
that
in
its
nature,
the
privilege
is
an
intimate
and
personal
one.
and
even
in
the
context
of
its
extension
to
the
production
of
papers
or
perhaps
of
other
effects,
this
personal
element
of
the
privilege
and
the
personal
delimitation
of
the
privilege
has
been
emphasized.
and
accordingly
in
the
series
of
cases
beginning
with
hale
against
henkel
through
united
states
against
white
and
its
progeny,
the
court
first
held
that
the
privilege
is
not
available
to
a
corporation
or
to
an
unincorporated
organization
of
any
kind,
although
there
was
no
specific
discussion
of
partnerships,
but
the
rational
of
the
white
case
which
extended
this
was
--
that
the
privilege
is
not
extend
to
“the
records
of
any
organization,
whether
it
be
incorporated
or
not”,
but
that
it
is
“limited
to
its
historic
function
of
protecting
only
the
natural
individual
from
compulsory
incrimination
through
his
own
testimony
or
personal
records.”
now,
there
is
a
possible
limitation
on
that
principle
expressed
in
dictum
in
the
white
case
to
which
i
will
return
in
a
moment.
the
other
aspect
involved
in
the
series
of
cases
and
slightly
more
difficult
aspect
in
light
of
the
boyd
holding
is,
what
about
the
individual
through
whom
the
state
seeks
to
compel
the
production.
the
government
seeks
to
compel
the
production
of
the
group’s
records
isn’t
he
being
force
to
come
forward
in
producing
them
and
identify
and
authenticate
what
might
incriminate
him?
and
doesn’t
that
run
into
the
essence
of
the
boyd
holding
or
as
it
was
re-expressed
not
long
ago
by
the
court
in
schmerber
against
california
that
the
privilege
extends
not
only
to
testimony,
but
also
to
responses
which
are
themselves
communications
such
as
the
production
of
one’s
papers
citing
the
boyd
case.
well,
the
court
has
rejected
that
argument
in
the
context
of
compulsory
production
by
an
individual
who
is
holding
papers
in
a
representative
capacity
so
long
as
the
production
order
requires
in
to
do
no
more
than
produced
papers
that
he
is
holding
in
that
fashion.
we’re
not
dealing
here
with
the
situation
where
the
production
order
says
that
he
is
to
produce
such
records
of
the
partnership
as
will
show
that
you,
isadore
bellis
under
reported
your
income
tax
so
that
the
production
would
be
any
--
would
constitute
more
the
communication
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
has
rejected
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
first
case
was
wilson
against
the
united
states
where
the
question
came
up
in
the
context
of
corporate
records
and
the
custodian
holding
corporate
records
in
hale
against
henkel
which
was
201
u.s.,
the
custodian
of
the
corporate
records
had
been
granted
immunity
so
the
question
didn’t
arise.
the
sole
issue
is
whether
the
corporate
records
themselves
were
privileged,
and
the
court
held
that
they
were
not.
and
then
in
the
wilson
case
in
221
u.s.
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
did
in
hale
against
henkel.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
question
in
the
wilson
case
was
whether
the
custodian
could
claim
that
his
producing
the
records
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
because
the
act
of
production
would
identify
and
authenticate
the
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
the
records
--
that
was
in
hale
against
henkel,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
i’ve
gone
out
to
the
wilson
case
which
is
in
221
u.s.
in
which
the
custodian
made
the
claim
that
he
could
assert
the
privilege
and
not
produced
the
records
because
their
production
would
incriminate
him.
and
the
court
rejected
that
claim
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
hughes
during
his
earlier
tenure
as
an
associate
justice
on
the
court,
and
the
rationale
of
its
rejection
is
summarized
in
a
quotation
that’s
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
and
this
is,
i
think
the
most
precisely
that
the
court
has
addressed
this
issue
in
the
context
of
these
cases.
the
fundamental
ground
of
decision
in
this
class
of
cases
is
that
where
by
virtue
over
their
character
in
the
rules
of
law
applicable
to
them,
the
books
and
papers
are
held
subject
to
examination
by
the
demanding
authority.
the
custodian
has
no
privilege
to
refuse
production,
although
their
contents
tend
to
incriminate
him.
in
assuming
their
custody,
he
has
accepted
the
incident
obligation
to
permit
inspection
and
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
curcio
case
seems
to
suggest
the
contrary
in
354
u.s.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
what
the
court
has
emphasized
is
what
seems
to
be
the
basic
rationale
that
remains
of
the
boyd
holding.
it
was
restated
again
just
last
term
in
couch,
quoting
from
the
white
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
wilson
has
created
an
exception
to
this
rationale
for
anyone
holding
records
in
a
representative
capacity.
this
exception
was
reiterated
in
united
states
against
white
with
respect
to
association
records,
and
the
custodian
in
that
case
of
the
labor
union
records.
and
the
court
there,
i’m
quoting
on
page
699
of
volume
322
put
it
this
way,
“but
individuals
when
acting
as
representatives
of
a
collective
group
cannot
be
said
to
be
exercising
their
personal
rights
and
duties,
nor
to
be
entitled
to
their
purely
personal
privileges.
rather,
they
assume
the
rights,
duties
and
privileges
of
the
artificial
entity
or
association
in
which
there
are
agents
or
officers
and
they
are
bound
by
its
obligations.”
in
their
official
capacity
therefore,
they
have
no
privilege
again
self-incrimination
at
least
to
the
extent
of
having
to
comply
with
the
production
of
order
when
they
are
the
custodian
of
the
records.
that
it
seems
to
be
the
basic
rationale
of
these
series
of
cases
and
i
think
in
light
of
the
couch
in
particular
which
holds
that
financial
records
of
this
kind
if
properly
secured
by
the
government
are
admissible
in
evidence
over
a
fifth
amendment
claim
by
their
owner,
the
rationale
about
authentication
and
identification
of
the
records
becomes
really
what
is
left
of
the
boyd
holding
as
i
understand
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
the
records
themselves
can’t
be
introduced
against
the
person.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
had
them
in
his
possession,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he
did
not
assert
the
fifth
amendment
because
there
is
no
occasion
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
fact
is
that
the
court
upheld
the
admissibility
of
the
records
against
mrs.
couch,
even
though
they
were
her
records
and
she
was
claiming
that
their
admission
into
evidence
against
her
violated
her
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
so
that
it
isn’t
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
implicit
in
the
holding,
it
seems
to
us
is
that
if
the
government
properly
secures
the
records,
they
are
admissible,
financial
records
are
admissible
against
their
owner,
not
withstanding
the
owner's
claim
of
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
now,
these
are
not
records
that
are
individually
owned
as
was
the
case
in
the
couch
case,
but
they
are
records
of
the
partnership
in
which
each
of
the
partners
has
a
sort
of
tendency
in
common
rights,
or
rights
as
a
co-owner.
and
for
that
reason,
we’ve
argued
that
the
rationale
of
the
white
case
and
subsequent
cases
in
this
court,
all
of
which
have
reached
the
same
result
with
the
mere
citation
of
the
white
case
with
respect
to
association
of
records,
is
that
in
that
circumstance,
the
custodian
does
not
have
a
right
to
resist
their
production.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
ran
to
mr.
bellis,
who
is
the
custodian
of
the
records.
it
was
not
a
subpoena
issue
to
the
partnership.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
white
case
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
white
case,
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
the
subpoena
was
issued
to
the
custodian
of
the
labor
union’s
records,
rather
than
to
the
association
itself.
but,
i
don’t
see
that
that
makes
a
difference,
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
comply
with
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
we’ve
been
puzzled
by
that
as
have
the
district
courts
in
all
of
these
cases
cited
on
page
29
of
mr.
sarner’s
brief.
we
have
noted
first
of
all
that
neither
this
court
nor
any
court
of
appeals
has
ever
yet
held
that
any
organizational
records
are
privileged
or
that
the
custodian
is
entitled
to
assert
their
privilege
in
resisting
a
production
order.
and
in
light
of
the
question
put
by
the
chief
justice,
we
suggested
one
possibility
of
what
this
rationale
--
what
this
essentially
dictum
in
the
white
case
meant.
the
test
that
was
stated
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
may
have
been
part
of
the
rationale
of
the
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
the
courts
have
found
it
difficult
to
apply
in
any
meaningful
way.
the
chief
justice
has
suggested,
well,
what
if
the
government
were
investigating
one
of
the
other
partners
rather
than
the
one
in
who
happens
to
have
custody
of
the
records
at
the
moment,
what
is
the
situation
there?
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
not
exactly
the
couch
case
because
the
custodian
might
say
that
these
records
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
as
well
as
his
other
partner
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even
if
his
partner
needed
them
for
exculpatory
purposes,
he
might
still
raise
the
same
claim
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
this
case.
and
that
seems
to
us
to
suggest
one
possible
answer
to
what
is
meant
by
the
white
case,
and
we
suggested
that
on
page
22
of
our
brief
that
when
the
association
is
one
in
which
the
law
recognizes
testimonial
privilege
of
confidential
communications
between
the
members
of
the
group,
then
it
seems
to
us
the
extension
of
protection
in
the
white
case
makes
some
sense.
for
example,
a
family’s
own
financial
records,
they
belong
to
the
husband
and
the
wife.
but
the
law
does
recognize
a
privilege
of
confidentiality
in
that
relationship,
and
that
is
what
in
the
words
of
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission
can
accurately
be
characterized
as
a
private
enclave
where
persons
are
entitled
to
lead
a
private
life,
at
least
free
from
the
intrusion
of
the
law
to
compel
self-incrimination
in
the
absence
of
a
grant
of
immunity
which
is
what
we
understand
that
rational
to
mean.
and
we
suggested
on
page
22
that
that
seems
to
us
to
mark
the
sensible
bounds
in
terms
of
legal
rights.
this
rationale
or
dictum
expressed
in
the
white
case
which
the
court
has
not
yet
applied
in
any
context,
which
gives
guidance.
it's
difficult
for
us
to
see
that
this
statement
from
the
white
case
distinguishes
meaningfully
between
a
three-man
partnership
or
a
four-man
partnership
or
between
a
19-man
partnership
or
a
20-man
partnership.
what
is
involved
here
as
we
set
forth
in
some
detail
are
the
ordinary
business
records
of
the
ordinary
operation
of
a
law
partnership,
receipts
and
disbursements
of
a
partnership
that
had
been
in
the
general
practice
of
law
for
some
15
years
which
had
in
addition
to
the
three
partners,
at
least
five
other
employees
which
had
a
firm
name,
the
firm
bank
account,
firm
stationary
was
representing
itself
as
engaged
in
the
general
practice
of
law.
it
is
difficult
to
see
on
what
basis
distinction
should
be
drawn.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
point
made
in
wilson
and
white
also
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
just
an
investigation
by
the
grand
jury
which
has
been
brought
investigatory
powers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
boyd,
he
can
claim
the
privilege
with
respect
to
his
personal
papers,
and
the
internal
revenue
service
in
its
enforcing
activities
has
been
complying
with
boyd.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
he
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
that.
he
has
obligations
as
a
fiduciary
under
state
law
to
be
able
to
make
an
accounting
to
his
partners
of
the
partnership
records,
and
they
are
available
to
his
partners
for
inspection
and
the
district
judge
said
for
copying.
his
partners
can
inspect
and
copy
these
records
and
they
have
the
right
to
an
accounting
from
him.
he
would
be
violating
his
fiduciary
obligations,
if
he
were
unable
to
separate
the
partnership
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
has
been
no
holding
on
that
that
i’m
aware
of.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
whole
thrust
of
state
law
that
his
partners
have
rights
that
can
be
frustrated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
only
response
i
can
make
to
that
is
that
the
whole
thrust
of
this
line
of
cases
in
the
court
is
that
when
one
is
holding
the
papers
as
a
custodian
and
a
representative
capacity
rather
than
holding
his
own
personal
papers,
he’s
not
entitled
to
make
that
claim
because
to
me,
issues
the
rights
of
the
other
persons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
many
of
the
case
have
involved
large
partnerships,
but
some
of
them
have
involved
small
partnerships.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
didn’t
refer
to
a
family
partnership
necessarily.
i
was
referring
to
the
family’s
own
family
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
when
you
get
in
to
a
partnership,
there
are
legal
rights
that
state
law
recognizes
between
the
partners
that
affects
the
confidentiality
of
the
partnership
records.
and
whether
one
individual
has
a
right
to
take
them
in
to
what
the
court
called
it
his
own
inner
sanctum
in
couch.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
the
legal
attributes
that
the
partnership
relationships
are
more
meaningful
than
comparing
the
sizes
and
activities
of
various
partnerships
which
the
courts
have
had
great
difficulty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
our
contention
doesn’t
base
it
on
numbers
at
all.
our
contention
bases
it
on
the
legal
rights
between
partners
who
are
associated
together
in
the
partnership,
and
because
each
individual's
partner’s
rights
are
limited
with
respect
to
the
partnership
records
by
state
law.
in
this
case
by
the
uniform
partnership
act
that’s
in
most
states,
his
rights
are
limited
by
the
rights
of
the
other
partners.
and
that
doesn’t
vary
whether
there
are
two
partners
or
200.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
would,
he
would,
your
honor.
he
is
not
required
to
testify
under
curcio,
but
he
is
required
to
produce.
the
court
in
curcio
assumed
that
he
could
be
required
to
produce
them
in
a
response
to
the
subpoena.
in
fact,
they
have
been
noted
in
the
footnote
that
he
had
produced
them
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
the
court
reaffirmed
the
white
holding
that
he
could
be
required
to
produce
them,
but
said
that
he
couldn’t
be
required
to
testify
as
to
their
whereabouts
if
he
chose
not
to
produce
them.
that
isn’t
the
issue
here.
of
course,
there
can
be
subpoenas
whether
they
deal
with
papers
or
not
that
would
elicit
incriminatory
information
from
an
individual.
if
you
subpoena
someone
to
produce
the
blunt
instrument
with
which
you
beat
a
certain
individual
on
the
night
of
april
14th
or
something
of
that
sort.
his
producing
of
the
instrument
in
response
to
the
subpoena
is
in
effect
some
communication.
if
the
subpoena
attempts
to
elicit
that
kind
of
information.
but
we’re
not
dealing
with
anything
of
that
sort
here.
the
only
thing
that’s
required
here
is
the
essentially
neutral
obligation
of
the
custodian
that
he
undertook
--
when
he
undertook
custody
of
the
association’s
records
to
produce
them
and
say
these
are
the
records
of
the
association.
they
are
called
for
in
the
subpoena.
not
to
say
anything
else
about
his
own
activities
that
would
tend
to
incriminate
him,
and
there’s
no
need
to
introduce
in
evidence
even
that
much
of
an
admission
on
his
part.
it’s
just
implicit
in
his
responding
to
the
subpoena
and
the
consistent
holding
of
this
court’s
series
of
cases
dealing
with
associational
records
is
that
that’s
an
obligation
he
undertook
and
undertaking
custody
of
the
associational
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
one
that
occurred
to
me,
is
the
one
i
mentioned
are
the
families
records
where
the
law
recognizes
a
testimonial
privilege
between
the
wife
and
the
husband.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
could
not
your
honor,
unless
under
the
law,
a
partnership
between
a
husband
and
wife
would
be
treated
the
same
way.
i
have
some
doubt
that
it
would
because
of
the
provisions
under
the
uniform
partnership
act,
giving
the
partners
rights
against
one
another
and
producing
fiduciary
obligation
in
that
context.
with
that,
it
was
one
possibility
that
occurred
to
us
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
be
very
limited.
on
the
other
hand,
no
court
of
appeals
has
found
any
context
at
all
in
which
to
apply
this
test
neither
has
this
court,
and
we
don’t
think
that
this
case
is
a
proper
context
we
are
applying
it
either.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
records
at
issue
here
are
the
financial
records
of
a
law
partnership.
the
production
order
which
is
set
forth
on
page
116
of
the
appendix
excludes
any
individual
client
files
containing
any
advice
or
confidential
relationships
between
the
attorney
and
the
client.
there
essentially
--
essentially,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
production
order
enforcing
a
grand
jury
subpoena
for
the
financial
records
of
the
partnership,
the
receipts
and
disbursements
record
of
that
kind.
the
claim
is
that
the
partner
in
possession
is
entitled
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment
claim
that
this
would
violate
the
provision
stating
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
at
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
this
is
a
provision,
the
background
of
which
has
been
reviewed
by
the
court
many
times
in
recent
years.
last
term
in
the
couch
opinion,
the
court
noted
that
historically,
the
privilege
was
to
protect
the
individual
from
resort
by
the
state
to
the
expedient
of
compelling
incriminating
evidence
from
the
individuals
on
mouth
as
the
court
put
it
in
couch.
and
in
light
of
the
language
of
the
amendment
and
its
historical
background,
the
view
has
been
expressed
by
members
of
the
court,
including
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
perhaps
the
privilege
might
have
been
intended
to
be
restricted
to
the
protection
of
the
testimony
and
judicial
proceedings,
and
only
to
bar
the
compulsion
of
testimony.
but
in
the
boyd
case
in
116
u.s.,
the
court
did
extend
the
privilege
also
to
the
compulsion
of
the
production
of
a
person’s
papers
in
his
possession.
now,
it
was
only
the
issue
in
boyd
didn’t
--
the
parties
in
boyd
and
the
court
in
boyd
didn’t
address
the
problem
of
the
relationship
between
an
individual
and
an
association
or
a
group
with
whom
he
was
related.
the
entire
issue
was
whether
the
privilege
would
be
extended
beyond
testimonial
compulsion.
and
as
the
court
noted
in
the
shapiro
case,
the
government
in
essence
contended
that
the
privilege
didn’t
extend
to
in
rem
proceedings
of
any
kind
that
it
only
extended
to
in
personam
proceedings.
but
the
fact
that
these
were
partnership
records
in
the
boyd
case
simply
wasn’t
discussed
either
by
the
parties
or
in
the
court’s
opinion
which
treated
them
as
mr.
boyd’s
personal
papers
and
several
times
in
the
principle
passages
of
the
boyd
opinion.
the
court
referred
to
these
as
personal
papers
as
it
has
insubsequently
referring
to
the
boyd
holding
in
united
states
against
white
and
also
in
the
couch
case
last
term.
it
was
only
after
boyd
was
decided
and
the
privilege
was
thus
extended
that
the
issue
arose
as
to
the
records
of
entities
other
than
natural
individuals
and
the
rights
of
individuals
who
are
parts
of
those
entities.
and
throughout
that
entire
series
of
cases,
the
court
has
been
very
conscious
of
the
basic
concept
that’s
implicit
in
the
history
of
the
amendment,
and
that
was
also
restated
last
term
in
the
couch
case
that
in
its
nature,
the
privilege
is
an
intimate
and
personal
one.
and
even
in
the
context
of
its
extension
to
the
production
of
papers
or
perhaps
of
other
effects,
this
personal
element
of
the
privilege
and
the
personal
delimitation
of
the
privilege
has
been
emphasized.
and
accordingly
in
the
series
of
cases
beginning
with
hale
against
henkel
through
united
states
against
white
and
its
progeny,
the
court
first
held
that
the
privilege
is
not
available
to
a
corporation
or
to
an
unincorporated
organization
of
any
kind,
although
there
was
no
specific
discussion
of
partnerships,
but
the
rational
of
the
white
case
which
extended
this
was
--
that
the
privilege
is
not
extend
to
“the
records
of
any
organization,
whether
it
be
incorporated
or
not”,
but
that
it
is
“limited
to
its
historic
function
of
protecting
only
the
natural
individual
from
compulsory
incrimination
through
his
own
testimony
or
personal
records.”
now,
there
is
a
possible
limitation
on
that
principle
expressed
in
dictum
in
the
white
case
to
which
i
will
return
in
a
moment.
the
other
aspect
involved
in
the
series
of
cases
and
slightly
more
difficult
aspect
in
light
of
the
boyd
holding
is,
what
about
the
individual
through
whom
the
state
seeks
to
compel
the
production.
the
government
seeks
to
compel
the
production
of
the
group’s
records
isn’t
he
being
force
to
come
forward
in
producing
them
and
identify
and
authenticate
what
might
incriminate
him?
and
doesn’t
that
run
into
the
essence
of
the
boyd
holding
or
as
it
was
re-expressed
not
long
ago
by
the
court
in
schmerber
against
california
that
the
privilege
extends
not
only
to
testimony,
but
also
to
responses
which
are
themselves
communications
such
as
the
production
of
one’s
papers
citing
the
boyd
case.
well,
the
court
has
rejected
that
argument
in
the
context
of
compulsory
production
by
an
individual
who
is
holding
papers
in
a
representative
capacity
so
long
as
the
production
order
requires
in
to
do
no
more
than
produced
papers
that
he
is
holding
in
that
fashion.
we’re
not
dealing
here
with
the
situation
where
the
production
order
says
that
he
is
to
produce
such
records
of
the
partnership
as
will
show
that
you,
isadore
bellis
under
reported
your
income
tax
so
that
the
production
would
be
any
--
would
constitute
more
the
communication
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
has
rejected
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
first
case
was
wilson
against
the
united
states
where
the
question
came
up
in
the
context
of
corporate
records
and
the
custodian
holding
corporate
records
in
hale
against
henkel
which
was
201
u.s.,
the
custodian
of
the
corporate
records
had
been
granted
immunity
so
the
question
didn’t
arise.
the
sole
issue
is
whether
the
corporate
records
themselves
were
privileged,
and
the
court
held
that
they
were
not.
and
then
in
the
wilson
case
in
221
u.s.
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
did
in
hale
against
henkel.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
question
in
the
wilson
case
was
whether
the
custodian
could
claim
that
his
producing
the
records
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
because
the
act
of
production
would
identify
and
authenticate
the
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
the
records
--
that
was
in
hale
against
henkel,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
i’ve
gone
out
to
the
wilson
case
which
is
in
221
u.s.
in
which
the
custodian
made
the
claim
that
he
could
assert
the
privilege
and
not
produced
the
records
because
their
production
would
incriminate
him.
and
the
court
rejected
that
claim
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
hughes
during
his
earlier
tenure
as
an
associate
justice
on
the
court,
and
the
rationale
of
its
rejection
is
summarized
in
a
quotation
that’s
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
and
this
is,
i
think
the
most
precisely
that
the
court
has
addressed
this
issue
in
the
context
of
these
cases.
the
fundamental
ground
of
decision
in
this
class
of
cases
is
that
where
by
virtue
over
their
character
in
the
rules
of
law
applicable
to
them,
the
books
and
papers
are
held
subject
to
examination
by
the
demanding
authority.
the
custodian
has
no
privilege
to
refuse
production,
although
their
contents
tend
to
incriminate
him.
in
assuming
their
custody,
he
has
accepted
the
incident
obligation
to
permit
inspection
and
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
curcio
case
seems
to
suggest
the
contrary
in
354
u.s.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
what
the
court
has
emphasized
is
what
seems
to
be
the
basic
rationale
that
remains
of
the
boyd
holding.
it
was
restated
again
just
last
term
in
couch,
quoting
from
the
white
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
wilson
has
created
an
exception
to
this
rationale
for
anyone
holding
records
in
a
representative
capacity.
this
exception
was
reiterated
in
united
states
against
white
with
respect
to
association
records,
and
the
custodian
in
that
case
of
the
labor
union
records.
and
the
court
there,
i’m
quoting
on
page
699
of
volume
322
put
it
this
way,
“but
individuals
when
acting
as
representatives
of
a
collective
group
cannot
be
said
to
be
exercising
their
personal
rights
and
duties,
nor
to
be
entitled
to
their
purely
personal
privileges.
rather,
they
assume
the
rights,
duties
and
privileges
of
the
artificial
entity
or
association
in
which
there
are
agents
or
officers
and
they
are
bound
by
its
obligations.”
in
their
official
capacity
therefore,
they
have
no
privilege
again
self-incrimination
at
least
to
the
extent
of
having
to
comply
with
the
production
of
order
when
they
are
the
custodian
of
the
records.
that
it
seems
to
be
the
basic
rationale
of
these
series
of
cases
and
i
think
in
light
of
the
couch
in
particular
which
holds
that
financial
records
of
this
kind
if
properly
secured
by
the
government
are
admissible
in
evidence
over
a
fifth
amendment
claim
by
their
owner,
the
rationale
about
authentication
and
identification
of
the
records
becomes
really
what
is
left
of
the
boyd
holding
as
i
understand
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
the
records
themselves
can’t
be
introduced
against
the
person.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
had
them
in
his
possession,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he
did
not
assert
the
fifth
amendment
because
there
is
no
occasion
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
fact
is
that
the
court
upheld
the
admissibility
of
the
records
against
mrs.
couch,
even
though
they
were
her
records
and
she
was
claiming
that
their
admission
into
evidence
against
her
violated
her
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
so
that
it
isn’t
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
implicit
in
the
holding,
it
seems
to
us
is
that
if
the
government
properly
secures
the
records,
they
are
admissible,
financial
records
are
admissible
against
their
owner,
not
withstanding
the
owner's
claim
of
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
now,
these
are
not
records
that
are
individually
owned
as
was
the
case
in
the
couch
case,
but
they
are
records
of
the
partnership
in
which
each
of
the
partners
has
a
sort
of
tendency
in
common
rights,
or
rights
as
a
co-owner.
and
for
that
reason,
we’ve
argued
that
the
rationale
of
the
white
case
and
subsequent
cases
in
this
court,
all
of
which
have
reached
the
same
result
with
the
mere
citation
of
the
white
case
with
respect
to
association
of
records,
is
that
in
that
circumstance,
the
custodian
does
not
have
a
right
to
resist
their
production.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
ran
to
mr.
bellis,
who
is
the
custodian
of
the
records.
it
was
not
a
subpoena
issue
to
the
partnership.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
white
case
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
white
case,
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
the
subpoena
was
issued
to
the
custodian
of
the
labor
union’s
records,
rather
than
to
the
association
itself.
but,
i
don’t
see
that
that
makes
a
difference,
he
is
the
one
who
has
to
comply
with
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
we’ve
been
puzzled
by
that
as
have
the
district
courts
in
all
of
these
cases
cited
on
page
29
of
mr.
sarner’s
brief.
we
have
noted
first
of
all
that
neither
this
court
nor
any
court
of
appeals
has
ever
yet
held
that
any
organizational
records
are
privileged
or
that
the
custodian
is
entitled
to
assert
their
privilege
in
resisting
a
production
order.
and
in
light
of
the
question
put
by
the
chief
justice,
we
suggested
one
possibility
of
what
this
rationale
--
what
this
essentially
dictum
in
the
white
case
meant.
the
test
that
was
stated
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
may
have
been
part
of
the
rationale
of
the
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
the
courts
have
found
it
difficult
to
apply
in
any
meaningful
way.
the
chief
justice
has
suggested,
well,
what
if
the
government
were
investigating
one
of
the
other
partners
rather
than
the
one
in
who
happens
to
have
custody
of
the
records
at
the
moment,
what
is
the
situation
there?
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it’s
not
exactly
the
couch
case
because
the
custodian
might
say
that
these
records
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
as
well
as
his
other
partner
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even
if
his
partner
needed
them
for
exculpatory
purposes,
he
might
still
raise
the
same
claim
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
this
case.
and
that
seems
to
us
to
suggest
one
possible
answer
to
what
is
meant
by
the
white
case,
and
we
suggested
that
on
page
22
of
our
brief
that
when
the
association
is
one
in
which
the
law
recognizes
testimonial
privilege
of
confidential
communications
between
the
members
of
the
group,
then
it
seems
to
us
the
extension
of
protection
in
the
white
case
makes
some
sense.
for
example,
a
family’s
own
financial
records,
they
belong
to
the
husband
and
the
wife.
but
the
law
does
recognize
a
privilege
of
confidentiality
in
that
relationship,
and
that
is
what
in
the
words
of
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission
can
accurately
be
characterized
as
a
private
enclave
where
persons
are
entitled
to
lead
a
private
life,
at
least
free
from
the
intrusion
of
the
law
to
compel
self-incrimination
in
the
absence
of
a
grant
of
immunity
which
is
what
we
understand
that
rational
to
mean.
and
we
suggested
on
page
22
that
that
seems
to
us
to
mark
the
sensible
bounds
in
terms
of
legal
rights.
this
rationale
or
dictum
expressed
in
the
white
case
which
the
court
has
not
yet
applied
in
any
context,
which
gives
guidance.
it's
difficult
for
us
to
see
that
this
statement
from
the
white
case
distinguishes
meaningfully
between
a
three-man
partnership
or
a
four-man
partnership
or
between
a
19-man
partnership
or
a
20-man
partnership.
what
is
involved
here
as
we
set
forth
in
some
detail
are
the
ordinary
business
records
of
the
ordinary
operation
of
a
law
partnership,
receipts
and
disbursements
of
a
partnership
that
had
been
in
the
general
practice
of
law
for
some
15
years
which
had
in
addition
to
the
three
partners,
at
least
five
other
employees
which
had
a
firm
name,
the
firm
bank
account,
firm
stationary
was
representing
itself
as
engaged
in
the
general
practice
of
law.
it
is
difficult
to
see
on
what
basis
distinction
should
be
drawn.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
point
made
in
wilson
and
white
also
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
just
an
investigation
by
the
grand
jury
which
has
been
brought
investigatory
powers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
boyd,
he
can
claim
the
privilege
with
respect
to
his
personal
papers,
and
the
internal
revenue
service
in
its
enforcing
activities
has
been
complying
with
boyd.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
he
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
that.
he
has
obligations
as
a
fiduciary
under
state
law
to
be
able
to
make
an
accounting
to
his
partners
of
the
partnership
records,
and
they
are
available
to
his
partners
for
inspection
and
the
district
judge
said
for
copying.
his
partners
can
inspect
and
copy
these
records
and
they
have
the
right
to
an
accounting
from
him.
he
would
be
violating
his
fiduciary
obligations,
if
he
were
unable
to
separate
the
partnership
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
has
been
no
holding
on
that
that
i’m
aware
of.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
whole
thrust
of
state
law
that
his
partners
have
rights
that
can
be
frustrated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
only
response
i
can
make
to
that
is
that
the
whole
thrust
of
this
line
of
cases
in
the
court
is
that
when
one
is
holding
the
papers
as
a
custodian
and
a
representative
capacity
rather
than
holding
his
own
personal
papers,
he’s
not
entitled
to
make
that
claim
because
to
me,
issues
the
rights
of
the
other
persons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
many
of
the
case
have
involved
large
partnerships,
but
some
of
them
have
involved
small
partnerships.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
didn’t
refer
to
a
family
partnership
necessarily.
i
was
referring
to
the
family’s
own
family
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
when
you
get
in
to
a
partnership,
there
are
legal
rights
that
state
law
recognizes
between
the
partners
that
affects
the
confidentiality
of
the
partnership
records.
and
whether
one
individual
has
a
right
to
take
them
in
to
what
the
court
called
it
his
own
inner
sanctum
in
couch.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
the
legal
attributes
that
the
partnership
relationships
are
more
meaningful
than
comparing
the
sizes
and
activities
of
various
partnerships
which
the
courts
have
had
great
difficulty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
our
contention
doesn’t
base
it
on
numbers
at
all.
our
contention
bases
it
on
the
legal
rights
between
partners
who
are
associated
together
in
the
partnership,
and
because
each
individual's
partner’s
rights
are
limited
with
respect
to
the
partnership
records
by
state
law.
in
this
case
by
the
uniform
partnership
act
that’s
in
most
states,
his
rights
are
limited
by
the
rights
of
the
other
partners.
and
that
doesn’t
vary
whether
there
are
two
partners
or
200.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
would,
he
would,
your
honor.
he
is
not
required
to
testify
under
curcio,
but
he
is
required
to
produce.
the
court
in
curcio
assumed
that
he
could
be
required
to
produce
them
in
a
response
to
the
subpoena.
in
fact,
they
have
been
noted
in
the
footnote
that
he
had
produced
them
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
the
court
reaffirmed
the
white
holding
that
he
could
be
required
to
produce
them,
but
said
that
he
couldn’t
be
required
to
testify
as
to
their
whereabouts
if
he
chose
not
to
produce
them.
that
isn’t
the
issue
here.
of
course,
there
can
be
subpoenas
whether
they
deal
with
papers
or
not
that
would
elicit
incriminatory
information
from
an
individual.
if
you
subpoena
someone
to
produce
the
blunt
instrument
with
which
you
beat
a
certain
individual
on
the
night
of
april
14th
or
something
of
that
sort.
his
producing
of
the
instrument
in
response
to
the
subpoena
is
in
effect
some
communication.
if
the
subpoena
attempts
to
elicit
that
kind
of
information.
but
we’re
not
dealing
with
anything
of
that
sort
here.
the
only
thing
that’s
required
here
is
the
essentially
neutral
obligation
of
the
custodian
that
he
undertook
--
when
he
undertook
custody
of
the
association’s
records
to
produce
them
and
say
these
are
the
records
of
the
association.
they
are
called
for
in
the
subpoena.
not
to
say
anything
else
about
his
own
activities
that
would
tend
to
incriminate
him,
and
there’s
no
need
to
introduce
in
evidence
even
that
much
of
an
admission
on
his
part.
it’s
just
implicit
in
his
responding
to
the
subpoena
and
the
consistent
holding
of
this
court’s
series
of
cases
dealing
with
associational
records
is
that
that’s
an
obligation
he
undertook
and
undertaking
custody
of
the
associational
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
one
that
occurred
to
me,
is
the
one
i
mentioned
are
the
families
records
where
the
law
recognizes
a
testimonial
privilege
between
the
wife
and
the
husband.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
could
not
your
honor,
unless
under
the
law,
a
partnership
between
a
husband
and
wife
would
be
treated
the
same
way.
i
have
some
doubt
that
it
would
because
of
the
provisions
under
the
uniform
partnership
act,
giving
the
partners
rights
against
one
another
and
producing
fiduciary
obligation
in
that
context.
with
that,
it
was
one
possibility
that
occurred
to
us
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
be
very
limited.
on
the
other
hand,
no
court
of
appeals
has
found
any
context
at
all
in
which
to
apply
this
test
neither
has
this
court,
and
we
don’t
think
that
this
case
is
a
proper
context
we
are
applying
it
either.
