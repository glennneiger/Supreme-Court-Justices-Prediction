chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
73-190,
bellis
against
the
united
states.
mr.
sarner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that’s
the
one
over
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
--
i’m
sorry
--
your
position
was
almost
--
if
one
of
the
other
partners
had
released
this
voluntarily
to
the
government,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
your
client
would
have
no
complaint?
or
at
least
no
complaint
that
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
hasn’t
that
somewhat
undermined
your
idea
that
this
is
a
matter
of
personal
private
papers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
someone
else
--
if
the
third
person
can
waive
the
right
for
your
client,
then
what’s
left
of
your
boyd
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let’s
track
this
down
on
a
practical
basis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
partner
of
the
partnership,
whether
it’s
a
three
or
a
hundred
partners,
one
partner
has
possession
of
the
records.
the
partnership
has
presumably
made
its
partnership
return
and
the
internal
revenue
is
checking
out
the
information.
the
man
in
possession,
the
partner
in
possession
refuses
to
give
it
up
in
response
to
a
request
directed
to
yet
another
partner
in
the
process
of
checking
that
partner’s
returns.
he
can
refuse
for
any
reason
to
give
it
up,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
it
was
one
of
the
other
partners
here,
that’s
what
i’m
driving
at.
one
of
the
other
partners
not
mr.
bellis
whose
personal
returns
or
individual
returns
were
being
checked
and
part
of
that
process
very
frequently,
want
to
check
the
partnership
records.
mr.
bellis,
now
if
i
give
those
records
in
connection
with
my
partners’
tax
inquiry
that
may
lead
to
some
incrimination
of
me.
he
can
do
that,
can
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
suppose
the
internal
revenue
might
do
then?
do
they
not
have
some
rather
harsh
weapons
in
terms
of
their
powers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
one
of
the
other
partners
involved
in
a
tax
case
needs
them
by
way
of
defense
to
a
government
claim
under
deficiency
assessment,
is
he
barred
from
getting
them
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
mr.
bellis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
in
the
face
of
a
claim
on
mr.
bellis’
part
that
turning
them
over
to
irs
for
the
other
partner
will
expose
him
to
criminal
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

the

mr.

you

chief

and
that’s
the
one
over
here.

see

is
