mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
government
has
gone
at
great
lengths
to
paint
mr.
kennedy
in
the
most
despicable
posture.
i
think
it
is
important
to
clarify
some
of
the
factual
errors
that
have
been
made
in
the
recitation.
i
would
do
so
very
briefly.
first,
mr.
kennedy’s
record
with
the
government
is
one
to
be
respected
not
castigated.
he
served
with
the
government
for
seven
years
prior
to
this
incident.
he
received
five
promotions
and
several
commendations.
after
he
was
restored
to
his
duties
by
order
of
the
lower
court
and
after
oeo
had
submitted
an
affidavit
which
stated
that
his
restoration
would
cause
him
irreparable
harm,
mr.
kennedy
was
given
a
raise,
a
complementary
evaluation
and
specifically
complemented.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
your
honor,
we
asked
the
government
to
include
that
in
the
joint
appendix
and
they
refused
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
they
are.
secondly,
what
the
government
states
as
its
facts
to
this
case
are
mere
charges
not
facts.
there
was
no
hearing
on
whether
mr.
kennedy
did
or
did
not
say
what
he
is
purported
to
have
said.
actually,
we
responded
to
these
charges
by
series
of
affidavits
on
the
basis
of
support
for
intention
and
a
now
defunct,
second
count
which
we’ve
got.
but
the
facts
are
the
facts
in
the
affidavits,
not
in
the
charges.
we
answered
those
charges
and
those
affidavits
were
never
denied.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
to
be
perfectly
honest,
it
is
not
wholly
clear.
what
did
happen
in
this
instance
was
that
the
lower
court
deemed
all
the
charges
irrelevant
to
the
proceedings.
we
filed
in
response
to
count
two
which
we
earlier
filed
a
series
of
affidavits
stating
that
his
speech
was
protected.
that
was
dismissed.
we
amended
and
then
charged
the
statute
was
vague
and
overbroad
at
that
point.
at
that
point,
the
charges
became
irrelevant.
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
affidavits
were
forwarded
to
them
or
not,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
think
like
i
said
and
i
think
the
matter
is
irrelevant.
the
factual
charges
are
irrelevant.
and
second
of
all,
we
contradict
each
of
those
facts
by
affidavit.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
we
did
not.
we
did
when
we
filed
an
answer
to
the
charges
asking
for
impartial
hearing
examiner
and
asking
for
hearing.
although,
it
is
not
clearly
stated
we
stated
in
the
in
our
answer
that
the
facts
were
set
forth
inaccurately
with
respect
to
the
conversation.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
said
that
the
facts
were
stated
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
well,
it
really
was
a
vice
versa.
most
of
the
answer
took
place
in
asking
for
hearing
and
we
answered
also
that
the
facts
were
inaccurately
stated.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
we
did
not
file
an
affidavit
at
that
point
in
time.
we
were
waiting
for
hearing.
mr.
friedman
has
told
you
part
of
the
story
on
the
suspension,
he
did
not
tell
you
all
the
story
and
i
believe
it
is
important
to
tell
you
that
story.
at
a
later
hearing
after
mr.
kennedy
was
suspended,
the
government
capitulated,
gave
mr.
kennedy
all
his
money
back
and
supposedly
expunged
that
matter
from
the
record
that
60-day
suspension
that
they
held.
furthermore,
one
of
the
charges
which
was
not
sustained
in
that
suspension
was
the
charge
of
leafleting
with
the
press
out
in
the
lobby.
that
charge
was
not
sustained
in
the
suspension.
it
was
later
resuscitated
and
used
as
a
basis
for
his
discharge.
with
respect
to
the
actual
charges
relating
to
the
discharge,
i
think
i
can
say
this,
mr.
kennedy
--
the
fact
show
that
mr.
kennedy
did
participate
in
the
press
conference,
he
participated
as
a
union
representative
with
four
other
unions.
he
is
the
only
one
to
my
knowledge
who
was
punished
for
that
press
conference.
as
i
also
noted
that
charge
was
not
sustained
in
the
suspension,
but
later
brought
back
in
the
discharge.
second,
mr.
kennedy
was
accosted
by
man
named
james
white
eagle
stewart,
an
indian
who
had
negotiations
going
on
with
oeo.
mr.
stewart
stated
to
mr.
kennedy
that
mr.
verduin,
the
regional
director
had
said
he
would
give
him
a
$100,000.00
grant
if
mr.
kennedy
would
be
implicated
in
some
actions
which
would
lead
to
his
fining.
mr.
stewart
said
this
not
only
to
mr.
kennedy,
but
to
ms.
laura
rockwell,
to
four
other
employees
and
to
the
entire
union
at
a
union
meeting.
it
was
not
mr.
kennedy
who
said
this
to
the
union
meeting,
it
was
mr.
stewart
himself.
mr.
kennedy
did
the
following
things
with
this
information.
first,
he
sent
a
night
letter
to
mr.
verduin’s
superior.
he
did
not
charge
bribery,
he
simply
alluded
to
the
events
has
he
had
been
told.
second,
when
a
reporter
called
him,
he
mentioned
the
story
to
the
reporter
that
the
reporter
called
him
first
and
asked
the
reporter
check
with
the
source
of
the
story
before
doing
anything
about
it
and
help
him
with
the
investigation.
third,
he
had
the
man
who
made
the
charges
go
over
to
senator
stevenson’s
office
and
fill
out
an
affidavit.
in
view
of
the
unique
situation
where
a
supervisor,
at
least
the
employee
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe,
the
supervisor
is
out
to
get
him,
i
think
mr.
kennedy
acted
with
remarkable
restraint
in
his
approach.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
to
be
perfectly
honest
your
honor,
i
don’t
intend
them
to
be
given
any
weight
and
i
hope
that
the
government’s
facts
as
they
say
are
not
given
any
weight,
i
think
they
are
irrelevant.
i
was
only
wanted
to
ensure
that
the
fundamental
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
we
have
never
been
granted
that
hearing
your
honor,
but
still
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
we
asked
for
it.
we
have
not
been
given
it.
since
this
case
had
started,
we
have
not
been
provided
with
the
civil
service
commission
hearing
we
asked
for.
that
is
over
15
months
ago.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
in
the
civil
service
commission
itself.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
have
no
idea
of
the
explanation
of
that
your
honor.
although,
some
cases
take
this
long
to
process,
and
that
is
a
fact
that
we
have
reported
in
our
brief.
the
government
states
in
their
brief
that
the
appeal
is
still
pending.
i
know
no
explanation
for
that.
it
seems
to
me
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
many
months
after
a
person
is
discharged
your
honor.
in
this
instance,
by
the
time
he
was
restored,
nine
months
after,
he
had
been
fired.
he
still
had
not
been
provided
the
hearing,
and
he
still
is
not
provided
with
the
hearing.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
kind
of
post
hoc
relief
becomes
irrelevant
when
a
person
is
out
of
his
job
for
a
year
marked
with
discharge.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
he
will
get
the
incremental
cost
or
the
incremental
benefits,
procedural
benefits
imposed
in
already
existing
systems
which
are
resort
to
a
neutral
official
prior
to
being
discharged.
the
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
his
accusers,
the
opportunity
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
and
some
backpay.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
in
this
instance
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
merits
are
still
provable.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
by
the
lower
court.
his
pay
was
actually
held
up
as
a
bond
for
the
appeal.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
government’s
contention
now
if
i
may
with
respect
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
not
at
all,
precisely
the
same.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
it
resort
to,
i
believe
an
independent
official.
the
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
your
accusers,
the
right
to
present
witnesses,
the
right
to
have
a
brief
record
made
at
the
proceedings
and
the
right
to
a
decision
based
on
the
evidence
of
this.
that’s
what
we
contend
that
we
are
entitled
to.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
bell
versus
burson
to
my
knowledge
had
not
precisely
spell
out
the
elements
of
the
hearing.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
really
have
not
--
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
think
that
is
an
important
issue
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
hearing
does.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
think
that
is
all
that
goldberg
gave.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
in
bell
against
burson,
that
is
correct.
we
are
not
asking
yet
but
we
are
asking
for
an
ability
to
prove
that
there
is
no
probable-cause
through
the
use
of
the
rudimentary
elements
of
due
process.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well
i
think,
any
kind
of
procedure
has
to
be
calculated
to
be
fair
to
achieve
the
truthful
result.
you
can’t
achieve
the
truthful
result
if
you
have
a
system
which
allows
a
person
who
is
complaining
witness,
prosecutor,
and
judge
to
make
the
decision
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that
your
honor.
i
think
there’s
a
difference
between
a
man
who
might
commit
murder
and
a
man
who
is
on
government
service
for
many
years.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
yes,
but
he
has
a
right
to
bail
your
honor.
our
client
has
no
right
to
bail.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
think
that
makes
a
significant
difference
whether
one
can
maintain
his
freedom
in
the
status
quo
in
the
interim.
our
client
has
no
such
alternative.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct.
just
for
a
very
short
time
and
for
a
very
rudimentary
and
expeditious
hearing.
the
hearing
of
professor
merrill
who
was
reported
to
the
administrative
conference
stated
that
almost
every
hearing
on
discharge
cases
takes
less
than
a
day
to
adjudicate.
we
do
not
ask
for
any
enlargement
of
the
time
to
takes
to
fire
a
federal
employee,
we
ask
merely
that
in
the
30-day
period
which
they
already
have,
if
you
are
given
these
rudimentary
rights.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
without
the
minimal
requisites
set
forth
in
goldberg
versus
kelly.
i
think
no
amount
of
process
or
procedural
ceremony
can
cure
the
fact
that
the
official
is
biased
against
you
and
this
system
has
not
guarantee
of
apparent
and
partiality.
here
in
this
instance,
the
man
who
fired
him
was
also
the
man
who
felt
himself
aggrieved
by
the
charges
and
the
man
who
marshalled
the
evidence
against
the
man.
no
system
can
work
if
the
man
who
is
biased
against
the
person
used
the
procedure
with
the
(inaudible).
additionally,
we
know
of
no
other
reliable
way
of
proving
the
truth
in
conflicting
facts
or
to
even
get
a
probable-cause
estimation
except
like
cross
examination.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
you
can
stay
within
the
treasury
department
as
i
would
--
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
that
situation
has
been
faced,
it
was
not
considered
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
interpret
it
to
be
that
someone
not
connected
with
the
initial
decision
to
discharge
the
person
may
hear
the
case.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
it
depends
on
how
closely
the
subordinate
works
with
the
man
i
suspect.
it
would
be
a
case
by
case
analysis
on
something
as
unique
as
that.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
the
right
to
present
you
own
witness
and
the
right
to
a
sketchy
or
brief,
not
a
sketchy
record.
a
brief
record
of
the
proceedings
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
right.
and
finally,
a
decision
based
on
the
evidence
adduced.
i
might
point
out
the
latter
if
there’s
no
requirement
that
a
decision
be
based
on
the
evidence
adduced.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
would
be
delighted
to
do
so
right
now,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
if
he
passes
certain
test.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
he’s
got
to
pass
certain
tests
here
too.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
he’s
got
to
be
hired
and
he’s
got
to
pass
a
probationary
period.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
right.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
that
dovetails
with
mr.
justice
stewart’s
comments
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
right
now.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
a
right
to
public
employment
in
the
abstract
is
the
not
the
question
we
have
here.
the
question
we
have
here
is
whether
or
not
a
person
may
be
fired
for
cause,
5
u.s.c.
7501
states
that
an
employee
may
only
be
fired
for
cause.
i
believe
that
that
is
the
statutory
entitlement
to
which
this
court
is
indicated
and
to
prove
that
a
hearing
is
required
in
the
roth
and
sindermann
cases.
i
also
believe
and
i
know
that
the
government
ignored
the
fact
that
a
host
of
other
statutory
benefits
and
entitlements
are
given
federal
employees
once
they
earn
them
by
passing
the
probationary
period.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
don’t
believe,
it’s
ever
been
this
court’s
disposition
to
measure
property
interest
by
the
procedure
protections
accordingly.
for
example
in
goldberg
versus
kelly
--
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
do
not
disagree
with
that.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
provision
in
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
which
says
you
may
only
be
fired
for
cause
leads
both
the
employee
in
the
abstract
at
least
the
government
to
believe
that
no
one
will
be
fired
except
for
cause.
now,
if
those
provisions,
those
procedural
protections
are
insufficient
to
show
cause,
then
the
procedural
protections
seem
to
me
to
fall
because
it’s
congress
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
understand
that.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
are
indivisible
from
it.
for
example,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
was
to
protect
government
employees
from
being
fired
arbitrarily.
if
the
procedure
which
is
kind
of
detail
of
that
act
does
not
assure
that
fact
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
does
not
assure
that
an
employee
will
not
be
fired
for
cause
then
the
procedure
is
defective.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct,
but
the
procedures
are
not
ample.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
for
cause
limitation
is
a
true
representation
of
congress’s
intent
that
people
be
fired
only
for
cause.
if
the
procedures
are
defective
and
they
do
not
produce
that
result,
then
they
must
fall
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
dishonesty.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well
i
think
both
interests
are
implicated
here.
i
think
the
property
interest
provided
by
the
statute
and
the
other
entitlements
given
by
the
statute
in
executive
order
and
mr.
kennedy’s
liberty.
if
the
government
takes
his
charges
and
seriously
as
it
states
it
does,
then
mr.
kennedy
is
most
certainly
being
stigmatized
in
both
his
pursuit
of
other
jobs
and
stand
in
the
community.
i
think
that
his
affidavit
which
is
uncontradicted
which
states
that
kind
of
discharge
is
firm
bar
of
employment
is
in
fact
the
result
of
the
government’s
firing
for
the
reasons
it
states.
and
i
will
briefly
allude
but
i
think
the
entitlement
is
there.
i
think
the
government’s
argument
is
very
dangerous.
for
example,
there
is
no
question
that
states
and
municipalities
may
take
property
through
their
--
even
renewal
projects,
anything
else
and
if
the
legislature
were
allowed
to
condition
the
taking
of
this
kind
of
property
on
the
basis
of
inadequate
procedural
safeguards,
and
that
somehow
composed
a
right
of
those
persons,
any
property
could
be
taken
without
due
process.
the
end
result
is
that
the
property
interest
has
to
be
evaluated
apart
from
and
not
together
with
the
procedures
and
the
procedures
if
the
property
interest
is
established
were
next
to
evaluate.
and
as
i
noted,
this
particular
case,
the
procedures
are
notably
defective
and
if
they
do
not
require
an
impartial
examiner,
and
they
do
not
require
cross
examination
or
confrontation
of
your
accusers.
in
fact,
the
procedures
do
not
work.
24%
of
those
fired
who
appealed
to
the
civil
service
commission
are
reinstated
at
a
subsequent
hearing.
thus
24%
are
improperly
terminated
under
the
present
procedures,
and
that
is
the
result
which
comes
from,
i
believe,
the
lack
of
procedure
and
rudimentary
due
process.
the
government
has
no
interest
in
this
system
as
it
stands
now.
seven
or
eight
federal
agencies
have
another
system
somewhere
to
what
we
request.
no
evidence
is
introduced
although
the
government
certainly
had
the
opportunity
to
introduce
evidence,
that
this
new
proceeding
will
somehow
hamper
it
or
burden
it,
no
evidence
at
all.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
absolutely
not.
but
i
do
not
think
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to
make
that
suggestion.
my
suggestion
is
only
that
that
kind
of
procedure
shows
that
it
works,
the
kind
of
system
we
want
works,
that
simply
a
fact
in
the
proof
of
our
case,
it
is
no
such
implication
that
--
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
the
privileges
to
granted
some
government
employees
beyond
what
the
constitution
requires
may
not
always
have
to
be
granted
to
other
employees.
that
is
not
the
thrust
of
our
case
though.
our
case
is
briefly
that
the
present
procedures
to
be
placed
on
the
government,
would
cost
the
government
very
little.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
count
two
which
is
the
free
speech
count.
our
contention
is
very
briefly
that
5
u.s.c.
7501
which
states
that
a
person
may
be
fired
or
any
statement
which
interferes
with
the
efficiency
of
the
government
is
vague
and
overbroad.
as
i
read
the
statute
in
the
legislative
history,
this
was
never
congress’s
intent.
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
was
never
meant
to
license
the
civil
service
commission
to
punish
persons
because
of
their
off
duty
speech.
rather
the
history
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
is
that
the
congress
meant
to
stop
an
executive
branch
intrusion
into
the
civil
service
employee
speech.
the
fact
is
that
the
--
it
was
a
reaction
to
gag
rules
which
punished
federal
employees
for
criticizing
their
superiors.
this
is
precisely
the
case
here
and
this
is
precisely
what
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
was
meant
to
stop,
not
to
start.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
i
believe
that
the
rule
of
this
court
is
a
person
who
is
potentially
affected
or
affected
by
a
statute
or
regulation
which
regulate
speech
is
free
to
bring
that
matter
to
the
court
before
any
adjudication
of
the
facts
of
what
he
actually
said.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here
but
mr.
kennedy
and
a
number
of
other
oeo
employees
brought
this
case
to
the
court’s
attention
after
mr.
kennedy
was
fired
on
the
basis
of
this
vague
and
overbroad
statute.
i
might
add
that
the
civil
service
commission
in
reading
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
to
proscribe
off
to
the
speech
has
not
only
worked
across
purposes
to
congress’s
original
intention.
it
has
also
ignored
relevant
judicial
admonitions.
in
1968
in
the
case
of
meehan
versus
macy,
the
court
stated
that
the
civil
service
commission
should
go
back
to
its
drawing
boards
and
come
up
with
some
narrow
and
precise
regulations.
that
invitation
was
never
accepted
and
we
are
left
with
the
statute
that
stands
now.
with
respect
to
its
vagueness,
i
can
only
say
that
the
three
judges
below
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
it
unreliable
guide
to
regulate
speech.
chief
judge
reynolds
in
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
also
when
faced
with
a
similar
efficiency
standard
on
a
state
level
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
it
vague
and
unreliable.
finally,
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
has
termed
it
an
open
invitation
to
arbitrary
action.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
judgments
cannot
be
ignored
and
they
certainly
--
it
certainly
go
against
the
government’s
contention,
this
standard
is
somehow
a
reliable
guide
to
the
ordinary
civil
servant.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
am
not
here
concerned
with
what
is
the
line
drawing
element,
what
is
the
border
line
element.
what
i
am
saying
is
if
that
kind
of
--
somebody
knowingly
states
a
false
fact,
a
serious
enough
about
his
superior,
he
probably
could
be
fired
if
there
was
a
statute
of
regulation
narrow
enough
which
told
them
that
kind
of
conduct
would
be
proscribed.
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
rule
so
employee
knows
what
he
can
say.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
cannot
knowing
they
charge
their
superiors
falsely?
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
but
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case
your
honor
but
the
facts
are
to
the
contrary.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct,
irrespective
of
what
he
said.
as
i
understand
it
that
rule
has
not
been
retreated
from
in
the
two
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
their
brief
dealt
with
conduct
not
speech.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
no
your
honor,
he
was
not.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
distinction
though
in
the
standing
of
a
person
to
raise
a
case
and
depending
on
whether
or
not
they
are
government
employee.
there
are
of
course
other
restrictions
but
i
do
not
read
that
to
be
one
of
them.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
right.
that’s
one
of
the
issues,
yes.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
that
--
solely
relating
to
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
which
is
count
two
in
our
complaint.
i
think
the
analysis
remains
the
same
as
in
gooding.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
what?
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
like
i
said
almost
everybody
who
has
had
an
occasion
to
analyze
this
in
detail
said
that
it’s
an
invitation
to
arbitrary
action.
and
as
i
read
the
government’s
position
in
this
instance,
the
government
says
that
any
speech
which
interferes
with
efficiency
of
the
government
is
proscribed
under
the
present
statute.
that
seems
to
sweep
within
it
truthful
criticism
that
may
impede
the
government’s
processes.
i
do
not
believe
that
to
be
the
opinion
of
this
court.
i
do
not
believe
that
efficiency
overrides
truth
in
free
speech.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
such
opinion.
finally,
as
i
understand
the
government’s
attack
our
speech
argument,
it
is
that
mr.
kennedy
somehow
is
a
hard
core
violator
in
the
terms
of
this
court
from
the
browder
case.
the
browder
case
was
concerned
with
conduct,
not
speech.
additionally,
there
is
no
hard
core
in
this
statute
to
violate.
the
statute
is
one
vague
anomalous
statute.
there
is
no
theories
or
false
system
of
regulations
which
implement
the
statute.
in
fact,
of
you
start
to
say,
there
is
not
one
regulation,
that
was
in
fact
an
oeo
at
that
time
of
statute
was
intervened
being
which
implemented
the
statute
as
with
respect
to
free
speech.
the
government’s
assertions
that
there
were
such
regulation
has
depend
upon
the
purpose
clause
of
certain
oeo
regulations
and
depend
upon
a
regulation
which
is
laid
with
conduct,
not
speech.
and
i
believe
that
is
the
government’s
failure
to
discern
that
there
is
a
difference
between
conduct
and
speech
which
causes
this
problem.
there
is
a
difference
and
i
believe
it
is
been
apparent
in
this
court.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
government
has
gone
at
great
lengths
to
paint
mr.
kennedy
in
the
most
despicable
posture.
i
think
it
is
important
to
clarify
some
of
the
factual
errors
that
have
been
made
in
the
recitation.
i
would
do
so
very
briefly.
first,
mr.
kennedy’s
record
with
the
government
is
one
to
be
respected
not
castigated.
he
served
with
the
government
for
seven
years
prior
to
this
incident.
he
received
five
promotions
and
several
commendations.
after
he
was
restored
to
his
duties
by
order
of
the
lower
court
and
after
oeo
had
submitted
an
affidavit
which
stated
that
his
restoration
would
cause
him
irreparable
harm,
mr.
kennedy
was
given
a
raise,
a
complementary
evaluation
and
specifically
complemented.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
your
honor,
we
asked
the
government
to
include
that
in
the
joint
appendix
and
they
refused
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
they
are.
secondly,
what
the
government
states
as
its
facts
to
this
case
are
mere
charges
not
facts.
there
was
no
hearing
on
whether
mr.
kennedy
did
or
did
not
say
what
he
is
purported
to
have
said.
actually,
we
responded
to
these
charges
by
series
of
affidavits
on
the
basis
of
support
for
intention
and
a
now
defunct,
second
count
which
we’ve
got.
but
the
facts
are
the
facts
in
the
affidavits,
not
in
the
charges.
we
answered
those
charges
and
those
affidavits
were
never
denied.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
to
be
perfectly
honest,
it
is
not
wholly
clear.
what
did
happen
in
this
instance
was
that
the
lower
court
deemed
all
the
charges
irrelevant
to
the
proceedings.
we
filed
in
response
to
count
two
which
we
earlier
filed
a
series
of
affidavits
stating
that
his
speech
was
protected.
that
was
dismissed.
we
amended
and
then
charged
the
statute
was
vague
and
overbroad
at
that
point.
at
that
point,
the
charges
became
irrelevant.
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
affidavits
were
forwarded
to
them
or
not,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
think
like
i
said
and
i
think
the
matter
is
irrelevant.
the
factual
charges
are
irrelevant.
and
second
of
all,
we
contradict
each
of
those
facts
by
affidavit.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
we
did
not.
we
did
when
we
filed
an
answer
to
the
charges
asking
for
impartial
hearing
examiner
and
asking
for
hearing.
although,
it
is
not
clearly
stated
we
stated
in
the
in
our
answer
that
the
facts
were
set
forth
inaccurately
with
respect
to
the
conversation.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
said
that
the
facts
were
stated
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct.
well,
it
really
was
a
vice
versa.
most
of
the
answer
took
place
in
asking
for
hearing
and
we
answered
also
that
the
facts
were
inaccurately
stated.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
we
did
not
file
an
affidavit
at
that
point
in
time.
we
were
waiting
for
hearing.
mr.
friedman
has
told
you
part
of
the
story
on
the
suspension,
he
did
not
tell
you
all
the
story
and
i
believe
it
is
important
to
tell
you
that
story.
at
a
later
hearing
after
mr.
kennedy
was
suspended,
the
government
capitulated,
gave
mr.
kennedy
all
his
money
back
and
supposedly
expunged
that
matter
from
the
record
that
60-day
suspension
that
they
held.
furthermore,
one
of
the
charges
which
was
not
sustained
in
that
suspension
was
the
charge
of
leafleting
with
the
press
out
in
the
lobby.
that
charge
was
not
sustained
in
the
suspension.
it
was
later
resuscitated
and
used
as
a
basis
for
his
discharge.
with
respect
to
the
actual
charges
relating
to
the
discharge,
i
think
i
can
say
this,
mr.
kennedy
--
the
fact
show
that
mr.
kennedy
did
participate
in
the
press
conference,
he
participated
as
a
union
representative
with
four
other
unions.
he
is
the
only
one
to
my
knowledge
who
was
punished
for
that
press
conference.
as
i
also
noted
that
charge
was
not
sustained
in
the
suspension,
but
later
brought
back
in
the
discharge.
second,
mr.
kennedy
was
accosted
by
man
named
james
white
eagle
stewart,
an
indian
who
had
negotiations
going
on
with
oeo.
mr.
stewart
stated
to
mr.
kennedy
that
mr.
verduin,
the
regional
director
had
said
he
would
give
him
a
$100,000.00
grant
if
mr.
kennedy
would
be
implicated
in
some
actions
which
would
lead
to
his
fining.
mr.
stewart
said
this
not
only
to
mr.
kennedy,
but
to
ms.
laura
rockwell,
to
four
other
employees
and
to
the
entire
union
at
a
union
meeting.
it
was
not
mr.
kennedy
who
said
this
to
the
union
meeting,
it
was
mr.
stewart
himself.
mr.
kennedy
did
the
following
things
with
this
information.
first,
he
sent
a
night
letter
to
mr.
verduin’s
superior.
he
did
not
charge
bribery,
he
simply
alluded
to
the
events
has
he
had
been
told.
second,
when
a
reporter
called
him,
he
mentioned
the
story
to
the
reporter
that
the
reporter
called
him
first
and
asked
the
reporter
check
with
the
source
of
the
story
before
doing
anything
about
it
and
help
him
with
the
investigation.
third,
he
had
the
man
who
made
the
charges
go
over
to
senator
stevenson’s
office
and
fill
out
an
affidavit.
in
view
of
the
unique
situation
where
a
supervisor,
at
least
the
employee
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe,
the
supervisor
is
out
to
get
him,
i
think
mr.
kennedy
acted
with
remarkable
restraint
in
his
approach.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
to
be
perfectly
honest
your
honor,
i
don’t
intend
them
to
be
given
any
weight
and
i
hope
that
the
government’s
facts
as
they
say
are
not
given
any
weight,
i
think
they
are
irrelevant.
i
was
only
wanted
to
ensure
that
the
fundamental
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
we
have
never
been
granted
that
hearing
your
honor,
but
still
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
we
asked
for
it.
we
have
not
been
given
it.
since
this
case
had
started,
we
have
not
been
provided
with
the
civil
service
commission
hearing
we
asked
for.
that
is
over
15
months
ago.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
in
the
civil
service
commission
itself.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
have
no
idea
of
the
explanation
of
that
your
honor.
although,
some
cases
take
this
long
to
process,
and
that
is
a
fact
that
we
have
reported
in
our
brief.
the
government
states
in
their
brief
that
the
appeal
is
still
pending.
i
know
no
explanation
for
that.
it
seems
to
me
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
many
months
after
a
person
is
discharged
your
honor.
in
this
instance,
by
the
time
he
was
restored,
nine
months
after,
he
had
been
fired.
he
still
had
not
been
provided
the
hearing,
and
he
still
is
not
provided
with
the
hearing.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
kind
of
post
hoc
relief
becomes
irrelevant
when
a
person
is
out
of
his
job
for
a
year
marked
with
discharge.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
he
will
get
the
incremental
cost
or
the
incremental
benefits,
procedural
benefits
imposed
in
already
existing
systems
which
are
resort
to
a
neutral
official
prior
to
being
discharged.
the
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross
examine
his
accusers,
the
opportunity
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
and
some
backpay.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
in
this
instance
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
merits
are
still
provable.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
by
the
lower
court.
his
pay
was
actually
held
up
as
a
bond
for
the
appeal.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
government’s
contention
now
if
i
may
with
respect
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
not
at
all,
precisely
the
same.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
it
resort
to,
i
believe
an
independent
official.
the
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
your
accusers,
the
right
to
present
witnesses,
the
right
to
have
a
brief
record
made
at
the
proceedings
and
the
right
to
a
decision
based
on
the
evidence
of
this.
that’s
what
we
contend
that
we
are
entitled
to.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
bell
versus
burson
to
my
knowledge
had
not
precisely
spell
out
the
elements
of
the
hearing.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
really
have
not
--
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
think
that
is
an
important
issue
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
hearing
does.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
think
that
is
all
that
goldberg
gave.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
in
bell
against
burson,
that
is
correct.
we
are
not
asking
yet
but
we
are
asking
for
an
ability
to
prove
that
there
is
no
probable-cause
through
the
use
of
the
rudimentary
elements
of
due
process.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well
i
think,
any
kind
of
procedure
has
to
be
calculated
to
be
fair
to
achieve
the
truthful
result.
you
can’t
achieve
the
truthful
result
if
you
have
a
system
which
allows
a
person
who
is
complaining
witness,
prosecutor,
and
judge
to
make
the
decision
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that
your
honor.
i
think
there’s
a
difference
between
a
man
who
might
commit
murder
and
a
man
who
is
on
government
service
for
many
years.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
yes,
but
he
has
a
right
to
bail
your
honor.
our
client
has
no
right
to
bail.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
think
that
makes
a
significant
difference
whether
one
can
maintain
his
freedom
in
the
status
quo
in
the
interim.
our
client
has
no
such
alternative.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct.
just
for
a
very
short
time
and
for
a
very
rudimentary
and
expeditious
hearing.
the
hearing
of
professor
merrill
who
was
reported
to
the
administrative
conference
stated
that
almost
every
hearing
on
discharge
cases
takes
less
than
a
day
to
adjudicate.
we
do
not
ask
for
any
enlargement
of
the
time
to
takes
to
fire
a
federal
employee,
we
ask
merely
that
in
the
30-day
period
which
they
already
have,
if
you
are
given
these
rudimentary
rights.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
without
the
minimal
requisites
set
forth
in
goldberg
versus
kelly.
i
think
no
amount
of
process
or
procedural
ceremony
can
cure
the
fact
that
the
official
is
biased
against
you
and
this
system
has
not
guarantee
of
apparent
and
partiality.
here
in
this
instance,
the
man
who
fired
him
was
also
the
man
who
felt
himself
aggrieved
by
the
charges
and
the
man
who
marshalled
the
evidence
against
the
man.
no
system
can
work
if
the
man
who
is
biased
against
the
person
used
the
procedure
with
the
(inaudible).
additionally,
we
know
of
no
other
reliable
way
of
proving
the
truth
in
conflicting
facts
or
to
even
get
a
probable-cause
estimation
except
like
cross
examination.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
you
can
stay
within
the
treasury
department
as
i
would
--
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
that
situation
has
been
faced,
it
was
not
considered
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
interpret
it
to
be
that
someone
not
connected
with
the
initial
decision
to
discharge
the
person
may
hear
the
case.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
it
depends
on
how
closely
the
subordinate
works
with
the
man
i
suspect.
it
would
be
a
case
by
case
analysis
on
something
as
unique
as
that.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
the
right
to
present
you
own
witness
and
the
right
to
a
sketchy
or
brief,
not
a
sketchy
record.
a
brief
record
of
the
proceedings
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
right.
and
finally,
a
decision
based
on
the
evidence
adduced.
i
might
point
out
the
latter
if
there’s
no
requirement
that
a
decision
be
based
on
the
evidence
adduced.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
would
be
delighted
to
do
so
right
now,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
if
he
passes
certain
test.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
he’s
got
to
pass
certain
tests
here
too.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
he’s
got
to
be
hired
and
he’s
got
to
pass
a
probationary
period.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
right.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct.
i
think
that
that
dovetails
with
mr.
justice
stewart’s
comments
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
right
now.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
a
right
to
public
employment
in
the
abstract
is
the
not
the
question
we
have
here.
the
question
we
have
here
is
whether
or
not
a
person
may
be
fired
for
cause,
5
u.s.c.
7501
states
that
an
employee
may
only
be
fired
for
cause.
i
believe
that
that
is
the
statutory
entitlement
to
which
this
court
is
indicated
and
to
prove
that
a
hearing
is
required
in
the
roth
and
sindermann
cases.
i
also
believe
and
i
know
that
the
government
ignored
the
fact
that
a
host
of
other
statutory
benefits
and
entitlements
are
given
federal
employees
once
they
earn
them
by
passing
the
probationary
period.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
don’t
believe,
it’s
ever
been
this
court’s
disposition
to
measure
property
interest
by
the
procedure
protections
accordingly.
for
example
in
goldberg
versus
kelly
--
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
do
not
disagree
with
that.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
provision
in
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
which
says
you
may
only
be
fired
for
cause
leads
both
the
employee
in
the
abstract
at
least
the
government
to
believe
that
no
one
will
be
fired
except
for
cause.
now,
if
those
provisions,
those
procedural
protections
are
insufficient
to
show
cause,
then
the
procedural
protections
seem
to
me
to
fall
because
it’s
congress
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
understand
that.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
are
indivisible
from
it.
for
example,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
was
to
protect
government
employees
from
being
fired
arbitrarily.
if
the
procedure
which
is
kind
of
detail
of
that
act
does
not
assure
that
fact
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
does
not
assure
that
an
employee
will
not
be
fired
for
cause
then
the
procedure
is
defective.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct,
but
the
procedures
are
not
ample.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
for
cause
limitation
is
a
true
representation
of
congress’s
intent
that
people
be
fired
only
for
cause.
if
the
procedures
are
defective
and
they
do
not
produce
that
result,
then
they
must
fall
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
dishonesty.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well
i
think
both
interests
are
implicated
here.
i
think
the
property
interest
provided
by
the
statute
and
the
other
entitlements
given
by
the
statute
in
executive
order
and
mr.
kennedy’s
liberty.
if
the
government
takes
his
charges
and
seriously
as
it
states
it
does,
then
mr.
kennedy
is
most
certainly
being
stigmatized
in
both
his
pursuit
of
other
jobs
and
stand
in
the
community.
i
think
that
his
affidavit
which
is
uncontradicted
which
states
that
kind
of
discharge
is
firm
bar
of
employment
is
in
fact
the
result
of
the
government’s
firing
for
the
reasons
it
states.
and
i
will
briefly
allude
but
i
think
the
entitlement
is
there.
i
think
the
government’s
argument
is
very
dangerous.
for
example,
there
is
no
question
that
states
and
municipalities
may
take
property
through
their
--
even
renewal
projects,
anything
else
and
if
the
legislature
were
allowed
to
condition
the
taking
of
this
kind
of
property
on
the
basis
of
inadequate
procedural
safeguards,
and
that
somehow
composed
a
right
of
those
persons,
any
property
could
be
taken
without
due
process.
the
end
result
is
that
the
property
interest
has
to
be
evaluated
apart
from
and
not
together
with
the
procedures
and
the
procedures
if
the
property
interest
is
established
were
next
to
evaluate.
and
as
i
noted,
this
particular
case,
the
procedures
are
notably
defective
and
if
they
do
not
require
an
impartial
examiner,
and
they
do
not
require
cross
examination
or
confrontation
of
your
accusers.
in
fact,
the
procedures
do
not
work.
24%
of
those
fired
who
appealed
to
the
civil
service
commission
are
reinstated
at
a
subsequent
hearing.
thus
24%
are
improperly
terminated
under
the
present
procedures,
and
that
is
the
result
which
comes
from,
i
believe,
the
lack
of
procedure
and
rudimentary
due
process.
the
government
has
no
interest
in
this
system
as
it
stands
now.
seven
or
eight
federal
agencies
have
another
system
somewhere
to
what
we
request.
no
evidence
is
introduced
although
the
government
certainly
had
the
opportunity
to
introduce
evidence,
that
this
new
proceeding
will
somehow
hamper
it
or
burden
it,
no
evidence
at
all.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
absolutely
not.
but
i
do
not
think
–-
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
no,
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to
make
that
suggestion.
my
suggestion
is
only
that
that
kind
of
procedure
shows
that
it
works,
the
kind
of
system
we
want
works,
that
simply
a
fact
in
the
proof
of
our
case,
it
is
no
such
implication
that
--
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
i
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
the
privileges
to
granted
some
government
employees
beyond
what
the
constitution
requires
may
not
always
have
to
be
granted
to
other
employees.
that
is
not
the
thrust
of
our
case
though.
our
case
is
briefly
that
the
present
procedures
to
be
placed
on
the
government,
would
cost
the
government
very
little.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
count
two
which
is
the
free
speech
count.
our
contention
is
very
briefly
that
5
u.s.c.
7501
which
states
that
a
person
may
be
fired
or
any
statement
which
interferes
with
the
efficiency
of
the
government
is
vague
and
overbroad.
as
i
read
the
statute
in
the
legislative
history,
this
was
never
congress’s
intent.
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
was
never
meant
to
license
the
civil
service
commission
to
punish
persons
because
of
their
off
duty
speech.
rather
the
history
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
is
that
the
congress
meant
to
stop
an
executive
branch
intrusion
into
the
civil
service
employee
speech.
the
fact
is
that
the
--
it
was
a
reaction
to
gag
rules
which
punished
federal
employees
for
criticizing
their
superiors.
this
is
precisely
the
case
here
and
this
is
precisely
what
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
was
meant
to
stop,
not
to
start.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
i
believe
that
the
rule
of
this
court
is
a
person
who
is
potentially
affected
or
affected
by
a
statute
or
regulation
which
regulate
speech
is
free
to
bring
that
matter
to
the
court
before
any
adjudication
of
the
facts
of
what
he
actually
said.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here
but
mr.
kennedy
and
a
number
of
other
oeo
employees
brought
this
case
to
the
court’s
attention
after
mr.
kennedy
was
fired
on
the
basis
of
this
vague
and
overbroad
statute.
i
might
add
that
the
civil
service
commission
in
reading
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
to
proscribe
off
to
the
speech
has
not
only
worked
across
purposes
to
congress’s
original
intention.
it
has
also
ignored
relevant
judicial
admonitions.
in
1968
in
the
case
of
meehan
versus
macy,
the
court
stated
that
the
civil
service
commission
should
go
back
to
its
drawing
boards
and
come
up
with
some
narrow
and
precise
regulations.
that
invitation
was
never
accepted
and
we
are
left
with
the
statute
that
stands
now.
with
respect
to
its
vagueness,
i
can
only
say
that
the
three
judges
below
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
it
unreliable
guide
to
regulate
speech.
chief
judge
reynolds
in
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
also
when
faced
with
a
similar
efficiency
standard
on
a
state
level
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
it
vague
and
unreliable.
finally,
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
has
termed
it
an
open
invitation
to
arbitrary
action.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
judgments
cannot
be
ignored
and
they
certainly
--
it
certainly
go
against
the
government’s
contention,
this
standard
is
somehow
a
reliable
guide
to
the
ordinary
civil
servant.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
am
not
here
concerned
with
what
is
the
line
drawing
element,
what
is
the
border
line
element.
what
i
am
saying
is
if
that
kind
of
--
somebody
knowingly
states
a
false
fact,
a
serious
enough
about
his
superior,
he
probably
could
be
fired
if
there
was
a
statute
of
regulation
narrow
enough
which
told
them
that
kind
of
conduct
would
be
proscribed.
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
rule
so
employee
knows
what
he
can
say.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
cannot
knowing
they
charge
their
superiors
falsely?
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
but
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case
your
honor
but
the
facts
are
to
the
contrary.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct,
irrespective
of
what
he
said.
as
i
understand
it
that
rule
has
not
been
retreated
from
in
the
two
cases
cited
by
the
government
in
their
brief
dealt
with
conduct
not
speech.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
well,
no
your
honor,
he
was
not.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
distinction
though
in
the
standing
of
a
person
to
raise
a
case
and
depending
on
whether
or
not
they
are
government
employee.
there
are
of
course
other
restrictions
but
i
do
not
read
that
to
be
one
of
them.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
right.
that’s
one
of
the
issues,
yes.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
that
--
solely
relating
to
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
which
is
count
two
in
our
complaint.
i
think
the
analysis
remains
the
same
as
in
gooding.
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
what?
mr.
charles
barnhill,
jr.
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
like
i
said
almost
everybody
who
has
had
an
occasion
to
analyze
this
in
detail
said
that
it’s
an
invitation
to
arbitrary
action.
and
as
i
read
the
government’s
position
in
this
instance,
the
government
says
that
any
speech
which
interferes
with
efficiency
of
the
government
is
proscribed
under
the
present
statute.
that
seems
to
sweep
within
it
truthful
criticism
that
may
impede
the
government’s
processes.
i
do
not
believe
that
to
be
the
opinion
of
this
court.
i
do
not
believe
that
efficiency
overrides
truth
in
free
speech.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
such
opinion.
finally,
as
i
understand
the
government’s
attack
our
speech
argument,
it
is
that
mr.
kennedy
somehow
is
a
hard
core
violator
in
the
terms
of
this
court
from
the
browder
case.
the
browder
case
was
concerned
with
conduct,
not
speech.
additionally,
there
is
no
hard
core
in
this
statute
to
violate.
the
statute
is
one
vague
anomalous
statute.
there
is
no
theories
or
false
system
of
regulations
which
implement
the
statute.
in
fact,
of
you
start
to
say,
there
is
not
one
regulation,
that
was
in
fact
an
oeo
at
that
time
of
statute
was
intervened
being
which
implemented
the
statute
as
with
respect
to
free
speech.
the
government’s
assertions
that
there
were
such
regulation
has
depend
upon
the
purpose
clause
of
certain
oeo
regulations
and
depend
upon
a
regulation
which
is
laid
with
conduct,
not
speech.
and
i
believe
that
is
the
government’s
failure
to
discern
that
there
is
a
difference
between
conduct
and
speech
which
causes
this
problem.
there
is
a
difference
and
i
believe
it
is
been
apparent
in
this
court.
thank
you,
your
honor.
