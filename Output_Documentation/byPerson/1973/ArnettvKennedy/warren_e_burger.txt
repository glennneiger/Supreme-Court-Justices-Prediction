we
will

arguments
next
in

against

mr.

chief

e.

we
will
resume
there
after
lunch.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
friedman,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman,
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
early
at
the
state.
i
do
not
want
to
stop
you
from
discussing
what
the
reasons
were
but
are
they
particularly
relevant?
is
the
case
going
to
turn
on
what
the
reason
is
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can
understand
you
are
illustrating
the
need
for
expeditious
action
but
otherwise,
it
isn’t
relevant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
barnhill.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
events
occurring
since
the
indication?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
contradict
them
in
the
administrative
hearing
or
the
administrative
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
take
it
from
your
presentation
of
the
facts
that
we
--
you
intend
that
we
should
give
them
some
weight
but
did
you
not
have
an
opportunity
before
the
civil
service
commission
to
test
these
out
in
the
full
adversary
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
my
question
to
you
is
a
different
one,
did
you
not
have
an
opportunity
to
explore
all
these
facts
that
you
are
discussing,
the
pro
and
the
con
who
is
telling
the
truth
and
who
was
not
telling
the
truth
in
an
adversary
proceeding
before
the
civil
service
commission?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
did
not
have
that
opportunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
civil
service
commission
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
explanation
for
that
dependency
of
this
litigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
in
terms
of
the
timing,
the
civil
service
commission
procedure
allows
you
to
test
out
all
of
these
allegations,
pro
and
con.
in
that
process,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
is
on
a
job?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
now
on
the
job.
he
is
been
reinstated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
getting
paid.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let’s
reduce
it
down
to
a
man
engaged
in
disorderly
kind
of
conduct
on
the
street
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
or
drunk
on
the
street,
he
is
picked
up
by
the
policeman
and
takes
him
to
the
station.
you
have
the
accuser
and
the
prosecutor
in
the
terms
you
are
talking
about,
all
engaged
at
that
stage,
but
he
goes
into
custody,
doesn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
another
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
freedom
question
here.
you
are
analogizing
freedom
to
continued
employment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
saying
that
this
probable-cause
to
believe
the
charges
cannot
be
carried
out
without
a
full
adversary
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
get
to
that,
i
like
to
pursue
one
question,
on
bell
and
burson
that
justice
brennan
was
asking
you
about
mr.
barnhill.
now
in
bell
and
burson,
we
were
dealing
with
an
automobile,
the
license
to
drive
an
automobile.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
supposed
you
would
agree
that
every
person
in
the
united
states
who
meets
the
age
qualifications
and
so
forth
is
entitled
absolutely
to
receive
a
driver’s
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
does
every
person
in
the
united
states
who
meets
qualifications,
entitled
to
be
--
to
have
government
employments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
the
difference,
you
can’t
refuse
the
automobile
license
if
you
passed
the
test?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
aren’t
automatically
given
government
employment
because
you
passed
certain
test
and
meet
the
age
requirements
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn’t
suggest
would
you,
mr.
barnhill
that
the
governments
could
be
somehow
penalized
because
it
tries
in
certain
areas
to
grant
more
rights
than
that
constitution
would
necessarily
command?
you
would
not
want
that
kind
of
experimentation
to
stop
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that’s
implicit
though
in
your
suggestion
that
they
should
give
as
much
as
eight
of
the
agencies
find
that
they
can
live
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
quite
see
the
difference
between
your
statement
and
my
suggestion
that
–-
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
barnhill,
if
will
it
help
you,
and
we
will
add
a
few
minutes.
we’ve
taken
a
lot
of
your
time
in
mr.
friedman’s
questions.
we’ll
add
a
few
minutes
to
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
will
give
you
about
six,
seven
minutes,
eight
minutes
more.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
do
you
suggest
that
government
employees,
now,
under
the
present
act
and
regulations
do
not
understand
that
they
can’t
charge
their
superiors
in
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gooding
was
not
government
employee,
was
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
are
talking
in
this
case
now
about
the
procedures
which
lead
to
his
interim
suspension
on
the
discharge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
quite
a
different
context
from
the
gooding
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
barnhill
and
you
have
about
three
minutes
mr.
friedman.
chief

e.

the
case
is
submitted.
