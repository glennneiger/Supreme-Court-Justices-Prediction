mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
holding
unconstitutional,
certain
provisions
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
governing
the
discipline
primarily
for
discharge
of
non-probationary
federal
employees.
the
case
brings
before
the
court
two
constitutional
questions.
one,
relating
to
the
procedures
followed
in
terminating
such
employees
and
the
other
relating
to
the
validity
of
the
standards
for
their
termination.
under
the
statute
and
the
implementing
regulations
of
the
civil
service
commission,
a
non-probationary
federal
employee
may
be
removed
from
office
after
being
given
a
written
statement
of
the
charges,
an
opportunity
to
reply
in
writing
or
orally
and
to
submit
affidavits
and
the
receipt
of
a
written
decision
by
the
officer
effecting
the
termination.
the
statute
however
explicitly
provides
that
a
hearing
prior
to
termination
is
not
required.
under
the
civil
service
commission
regulations
however,
the
employee
following
such
termination
has
the
right
to
a
hearing
even
before
the
agency
or
before
the
civil
service
commission
and
the
first
question
presented
is
whether
this
statutory
practice
which
in
effect
defers
the
evidentiary
hearing
to
an
appeal
following
the
termination
satisfies
the
due
process
standards
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
statute
itself
provides
that
a
federal
employee
may
be
removed
only
for
such
cause
as
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
again,
the
civil
service
commission
has
implemented
this
rather
general
standard
through
some
regulations
which
i
will
come
to
shortly.
the
substantive
question
in
the
case
is
whether
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
when
this
provision
is
applied
to
terminate
the
service
of
a
non-probationary
government
employee
because
of
statements
he
has
made,
public
statements
accusing
his
superiors
of
misfeasance
and
criminal
activity
and
which
in
the
judgment
of
his
superiors
effectively
undermines
the
ability
of
the
agency
to
performs
its
services.
now
the
court
in
this
case
invalidated
the
statute
on
its
face
on
the
basis
of
granting
summary
judgment
for
the
appellees
and
under
civil
practices,
the
validity
of
that
action
maybe
just
be
tested
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
most
strongly
supporting
the
government
and
accordingly,
i
shall
state
the
facts
of
this
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
there
were
before,
it
isn’t
explicit.
i
would
assume
mr.
justice
they
were
before
the
court
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
but
summary
judgment
was
granted
against
us.
summary
judgment
was
granted
against
us
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
considering
the
propriety
of
that
action,
we
can
properly
look
to
the
evidence
that
would
support
our
case,
not
the
evidence
that
would
support
their
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes.
yes.
but
the
evidence
before
the
court
included
much
of
the
material
that
was
the
basis
for
the
discharge
of
mr.
kennedy.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
one
other
thing.
in
their
brief,
the
appellees
at
pages
2
and
3
have
stated
that
much
of
what
the
government
has
set
forth
as
its
statement
of
the
case
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
we
disagree
with
that
and
accordingly
in
my
presentation,
whenever
we
get
to
any
controverted
materials,
i
will
give
record
references
to
the
appendix
which
support
the
statements
i
am
making.
the
appellee,
mr.
kennedy
at
the
time
of
these
events
was
a
field
representative
in
the
chicago
office
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity.
he
was
a
fairly
important
man
there.
he
had
a
government
grade
of
gs-12
which
is
in
the
intermediate
range
and
paid
at
that
time
$16,000.00.
as
explained
in
the
instructions
that
oeo
puts
out
to
its
field
representatives
which
are
quoted
in
the
record
in
the
affidavit
of
the
regional
director.
the
field
representative
was
a
particularly
crucial
person
in
the
operation
of
oeo.
oeo
of
course,
its
basic
function
is
to
channel
funds
to
various
community
groups
to
enable
them
to
improve
their
life
economically.
and
his
job
was
to
have
contact
with
the
community
action
groups
to
talk
with
them,
to
explain
to
the
community
action
groups
what
oeo
is
doing,
what
its
policies
were
and
to
be
sure
that
these
policies
were
being
carried
out
in
the
implementation
of
the
programs
by
the
community
action
groups.
as
oeo
stated
itself,
this
man
as
a
practical
matter
was
viewed
by
the
community
groups
as
oeo.
his
job
as
i
said
was
to
explain
these
policy
decisions.
that
material
is
set
forth
at
pages
24
and
25
of
the
appendix.
and
mr.
kennedy
has
twice
been
subjected
to
disciplinary
action
in
this
situation.
in
the
first
instance
in
november
of
1971,
he
was
charged
by
the
regional
director
with
various
acts
of
misconduct.
he
replied
in
writing
a
lengthy
reply
which
is
not
included
in
the
appendix.
he
had
an
oral
presentation
before
the
regional
director
and
following
this
in
january
1972,
the
regional
director
concluded
that
only
one
of
the
several
charges
made
against
him
was
sustained
by
the
evidence,
and
instead
of
terminating
his
services
as
he
had
originally
proposed,
instead,
he
suspended
him
the
60
days.
i
just
mentioned
in
passing
because
i
think,
this
is
an
indication
of
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
appellees
say
that
this
was
outrageous
because
he
was
suspended
for
60
days
on
the
basis
of
a
single
telephone
conversation
that
took
place
11
months
before.
well,
the
reason
for
the
11
months
before
is
that
the
charges
against
him
which
led
to
this
suspension
covered
a
period
of
almost
a
year
and
this
was
the
only
one
of
the
charges
that
was
sustained.
but
the
single
telephone
conversation
was
a
phone
conversation
he
made
to
officials
of
one
these
community
action
groups
in
which
he
told
them
they
should
get
rid
of
the
existing
board
of
directors
and
get
themselves
a
new
board
of
directors
which
they
could
control.
he
did
this
inspite
of
the
fact
that
there
were
specific
instructions
from
oeo
set
forth
at
pages
38
to
40
of
the
appendix
that
field
representatives
were
to
keep
their
hands
off
the
internal
operations
of
these
community
action
groups.
there
were
allowed
then
to
make
their
own
decisions
even
though
they
seemed
wrong
to
maintain
an
arms-length
posture,
and
even
though
he
had
previously
been
warned
against
such
activities
when
he
had
a
previous
situation.
i
just
may
say
one
thing
well,
i
think
this
illustrates
very
dramatically
the
kind
of
disrupted
effect
this
sort
of
conduct
would
have.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
now
like
to
come
to
the
second
set
of
charges
on
the
basis
of
which
mr.
kennedy
was
discharged
from
federal
service.
this
was
served
upon
him
in
february
1972
approximately
three
weeks
after
his
previous
notice
of
his
suspension.
basically,
these
charges
related
to
two
different
activities.
one,
related
to
certain
statements
he
made
with
relation
to
a
problem
had
arisen
in
chicago
relating
to
the
indians
in
chicago.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reasons
are
important.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
this
extent
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
claims
here
is
that
a
hearing
was
required
in
advance
of
termination.
under
the
statutory
provisions,
this
man
is
given
an
opportunity
as
told
what
the
charges
are
against
him
has
the
opportunity
to
respond
both
orally
and
in
writing
and
to
submit
affidavits.
and
then
if
he
is
discharged,
he
has
a
right
to
full
hearing
with
the
complete
panoply
of
procedures
after
that
discharge.
in
this
case,
he
was
given
rather
very
specific
charges
of
certain
improprieties
and
he
did
not
submit
any
material
at
all.
so
to
that
extent,
we
think
the
facts
are
significant.
in
addition,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
facts
are
quite
significant
in
evaluating
his
claim
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
an
infringement
of
his
first
amendment
rights
because
our
basic
position
on
that
is
that
a
conscientious
government
employee
could
really
have
not
doubt
that
the
kind
of
things
he
is
alleged
to
have
done
would
be
detrimental
to
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
now,
that’s
the
reason
i
am
stressing
these
facts
because
i
think
the
case
has
to
be
brought
into
a
proper
postures.
now,
the
two
allegations
with
respect
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
working
on
a
controversial
field
mr.
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly,
it’s
controversial
but
mr.
justice,
his
role,
his
role
was
supporting
oeo
in
this
controversy.
his
job
was
to
represent
oeo
and
to
explain
to
the
community
what
oeo
is
doing
and
to
try
to
persuade
the
community
that
it
should
accept
oeo’s
treatment
of
this
problem.
what
he
did
instead
of
doing
that,
he
turned
around
and
made
a
number
a
very
serious
and
we
think
unjustified
attacks
on
oeo
and
on
his
superiors.
attacks
which
according
to
the
affidavit
of
the
regional
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
with
all
due
respect
mr.
justice,
i
don’t
think
that
was
his
function
as
an
employee
of
oeo.
if
he
had
complaints
about
oeo
about
the
way
the
program
was
being
administered,
it
was
his
obligation
we
think
to
make
those
complaints
through
channels,
not
to
make
statements
to
the
press,
not
to
make
at
public
meeting
or
the
union
meeting.
let
me
tell
you
what
he
did
for
example
he
said,
he
said
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
in
terms
of
what
happened
most
assuredly
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
tell
you
exactly
what
the
charges
against
him
were.
first
of
all,
he
said
that
the
regional
director
and
his
executive
assistant
had
either
bribed
or
tempted
to
bribe
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
indian
community
in
chicago
by
offering
this
man
a
grant
of
$100,000.00,
if
this
man
in
turn
would
make
a
statement,
give
a
written
statement
against
mr.
kennedy
and
another
employee
who
was
active
in
the
union.
he
made
this
charge
at
a
union
meeting,
and
this
charge
was
repeated
in
a
newspaper
report
of
the
meeting.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
true
according
to
the
--
no,
no,
i
am
sorry.
he
claimed
it’s
true.
the
regional
director
found
it
was
not
true,
found
it
was
not
true.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
he
conducted
a
press
conference
in
the
lobby
of
the
building
where
oeo.
as
he
conducted
it
into
the
lobby
because
he
had
been
refused
permission
after
his
suspension
to
hold
a
press
conference
in
the
oeo
offices
where
he
wanted
and
he
got
handed
out
a
press
release
and
set
forth
at
pages
44
and
45
of
the
record
in
which
he
accused
the
regional
director
of
breaking
treaties
with
the
indians.
it
was
a
newspaper
story
covering
that.
in
addition
to
that,
he
made
an
accusation
against
an
oeo
official
that
they
had
violated
the
oeo
conflict
of
interest
standards
by
entering
into
an
insurance
contract
with
a
company
with
which
the
husband
of
this
woman
was
connected.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
he
was
told,
he
was
told
in
this
notice
of
charges
that
he
could
submit
either
written
answers
with
affidavits
and
an
oral
hearing,
he
did
neither,
all
he
did
was
file
an
answer
which
is
set
forth
at
page
62
of
the
record
in
which
he
said
he
wanted
a
hearing
before
an
impartial
hearing
officer
and
he
said
that
applying
this
statute
to
punish
him,
to
discharge
him
on
the
basis
of
statements,
speech
he
had
made
violated
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
following
the
receipt
of
this,
he
did
not
submit
anything.
further
than
that,
the
regional
director
informed
mr.
kennedy
in
writing
that
the
charges
against
was
sustained,
directed
his
removal
and
informed
mr.
kennedy
that
he
had
the
right
to
appeal
that
either
to
the
agency,
within
the
agency
itself
or
to
the
civil
service
commission.
he
elected
to
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission.
i
just
like
briefly
to
refer
to
the
affidavit
of
the
regional
director
submitted
in
the
district
court
in
opposition
to
their
motion
for
a
stay
which
would
have
the
effect
of
putting
mr.
kennedy
--
keeping
mr.
kennedy
at
work
and
he
explained
in
considerable
detail
what
had
led
to
mr.
kennedy’s
discharge.
and
that
at
the
end
of
bottom
of
page
32
and
the
top
of
page
33,
after
first
pointing
out
that
he
recognized
the
importance
of
free
and
open
discussion
within
the
agency,
and
he
also
recognized
the
importance
of
constructive
criticism
within
the
agency
but
he
said
however,
when
the
criticisms
take
the
form
of
malicious
personal
attacks
made
publicly
by
a
field
representative
who
is
viewed
as
oeo
by
the
community
at
large,
when
the
criticism
result
in
a
breakdown
and
the
necessary
maintenance
of
discipline
produced
serious
disharmony
among
co-workers
and
loss
of
morale
and
destroy
ongoing
efforts
of
this
office
to
serve
the
poor
and
the
disadvantaged
then
the
efficiency
of
government
has
dealt
a
severe
blow.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
bottom
of
page
32.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
also
pointed
out
at
the
top
of
the
page
that
prior
to
the
issuance
of
mr.
kennedy’s
press
release,
the
office
had
been
attempting
to
put
together
a
coalition
among
the
indians
of
chicago
that
would
create
an
organization
that
was
able
to
receive
and
handle
a
substantial
grant.
but
after
his,
mr.
kennedy’s
attack
on
oeo
as
he
put
it
the
coalition
fell
apart
and
as
of
the
time
of
filing
of
the
affidavit,
he
stated
that
had
not
been
able
to
put
together
another
coalition
and
process
the
grant.
in
the
district
court
as
i
have
indicated,
the
court
first
held
that
the
statute
was
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
because
of
its
failure
under
the
statute
and
the
procedures
to
give
mr.
kennedy
an
adversary
full
hearing
before
his
termination
and
on
the
basis
of
that
conclusion
directed
the
mr.
kennedy
be
reinstated
and
he
has
been
reinstated.
the
court
also
said
that
although
he
had
recognized
that
the
conduct
of
the
speech
which
was
the
basis
for
mr.
kennedy’s
discharge
did
provide
a
basis
for
disciplinary
action,
nevertheless,
the
statute
it
held
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
said
this
vague
language
is
likely
to
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
other
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights
and
it
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
in
the
regulations
and
this
is
the
language
from
7
(a)
of
our
jurisdictional
statement
of
the
opinion
insofar
as
they
have
construed
to
regulate
the
speech
of
competitive
service
employees,
a
very
broad
injunction.
now,
coming
to
the
merits
of
the
case
the
statutory
argument.
first,
as
with
respect
to
the
procedural
due
process
issue,
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
of
1912
was
enacted
to
provide
substantial
protections
for
federal
employees.
prior
to
that
time,
federal
employees
had
virtually
no
job
protection
at
all.
they
were
subject
almost
to
dismissal
at
the
whim
or
the
caprice
of
their
superiors.
and
what
congress
did
in
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
which
is
keep
provisions
of
which
in
that
present
form
is
set
forth
at
page
37
of
the
brief
was
to
do
two-three
things
--
really
two
things.
the
first
was
it
provides
in
the
first
sentence
that
an
individual
in
the
competitive
service
may
be
removed
or
suspended
without
pay
only
for
such
cause
as
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
for
the
first
time
wrote
into
law
a
job
protection
for
federal
employees.
they
could
only
be
dismissed
for
cause
and
only
such
cause
would
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
then
it
provided
certain
procedural
protections.
the
employee
was
to
get
notice
of
the
charges,
had
a
reasonable
time
to
file
a
written
answer
to
the
charges
and
affidavits,
and
was
entitled
for
a
written
decision.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
examination
of
witnesses,
trial
or
hearing
is
not
required
but
may
be
provided
in
the
discretion
of
the
individual
directing
the
removal
or
suspension
without
pay.
and
what
congress
has
done
is
to
leave
it
to
the
individual
agency
to
decide
whether
or
not
in
following
its
discharge
procedures
it
gives
the
man
a
hearing
prior
to
his
termination.
at
the
present
time,
eight
agencies
do
provide
for
such
pre-termination
hearings.
they
employ
approximately
10%
of
the
federal
workforce
but
the
statistics
that
we
have
from
the
civil
service
commission
indicate
that's
a
much
smaller
percentage
of
disciplinary
proceedings.
a
vast
bulk
of
government
agencies
in
number
covering
the
vast
bulk
of
federal
employees
do
not
provide
for
any
pre-discharge
hearing.
what
they
do
provide
for
is
the
and
under
the
regulations
of
the
civil
service
commission,
a
30-day
notice
of
charges,
full
statement
of
the
charges,
an
opportunity
either
to
reply
in
writing
or
orally
to
submit
affidavits,
the
opportunity
of
the
man
to
examine
the
civil
service
files
containing
the
information
in
which
the
charges
are
based
and
an
opportunity
in
a
written
report.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
of
that,
not
of
that
stage
mr.
justice.
not
of
that
stage.
but,
after
if
he
is
discharged,
he
has
a
full
hearing
with
a
complete
right
to
confront
all
the
witnesses,
a
transcript
was
taken
to
produced
his
own
witness,
superiored
by
counsel.
and
if
that
was
the
result
of
that
hearing
which
is
i
have
indicated
maybe
either
before
the
agency
of
the
civil
service
commission,
if
as
a
result
of
that
hearing,
he
is
ordered
reinstated,
if
his
discharged
is
set
aside,
he
gets
full
backpay
under
the
statute
for
the
period
he
was
out
of
work.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
over
the
years
and
most
recently
in
the
cafeteria
workers
case
that
without
legislation
unless
there
is
some
specific
legislative
provision,
a
government
employee
may
be
summarily
discharged.
here,
we
do
have
a
statute.
we
have
a
statute
which
provides
that
before
he
can
be
discharged,
it
has
to
be
for
cause
and
after
certain
provisions
specified
by
the
statute.
the
procedural
due
process
as
this
court
as
many
times
stated
is
a
flexible
concept.
say,
you
do
not
have
fixed
rules,
you
got
to
weigh
competing
interests
in
this
situation.
here,
we
have
two
competing
interests.
on
the
one
hand
is
the
obvious
interest
of
a
government
employee
not
to
have
his
federal
employment
finally
terminated
without
procedures
in
which
he
can
fairly
present
his
case.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
very
strong
government
interest
of
removing
incompetent,
unsuitable
employees
from
the
public
payroll
so
that
the
government
can
proceed
with
its
business
effectively
and
expeditiously
and
obviously,
if
a
pre-termination
hearing
is
required
in
every
case,
this
is
inevitably
bound
to
delay
the
proceedings.
it
seems
to
me
that
itself
evident
that
if
in
every
case,
an
employee
has
the
option
for
a
hearing,
many
employees
knowing
of
the
delay,
is
just
going
to
request
a
hearing.
some
statistics
that
i
referred
to
in
an
article
by
professor
merrill
that
is
quoted
in
our
opponent’s
brief
in
the
59
university
of
virginia
law
review
points
out
that
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
government
disciplinary
actions
are
taken
to
hearing.
the
figures
we
have,
it
is
something
like
maybe
10%
or
something
in
that
range.
and
inevitably,
this
would
lead
to
a
proliferation
of
these
hearings
to
delays
in
discharging
incompetent
or
unsuitable
government
employees.
now,
we
think
that
the
due
process
requires
no
more
in
this
situation
than
is
done.
that
is
the
employee
has
--
this
is
not
a
case
where
someone
is
cutoff
with
a
letter
saying
you
are
terminated
today.
the
employee
has
the
opportunity
to
present
informally
to
be
sure
but
has
the
opportunity
to
present
to
his
agency
any
facts
that
he
believes
mitigate
against
the
proposal
or
show
that
it
its
uncertainty,
for
example
he
can
show
that
perhaps
the
whole
thing
rests
on
a
mistake.
maybe
the
facts
are
wrong.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
be
making
that
same
argument
mr.
justice
but
i
do
not
have
to
make
that
argument
because
here
congress
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that’s
all
the
government
did
but
that
is
correct.
but
here
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
i
am
saying
mr.
justice
is
that
i
would
be
prepared
to
defend
the
narrowest
statute
but
in
this
case
certainly
under
this
procedure
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
defend
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
defend
it
but
i
do
not
have
to
attempt
to
justify
that
position
because
here
we
do
have
the
complete
de
novo
hearing.
and
if
i
may
point
out
mr.
justice,
this
is
not
just
an
idle
thing,
his
ability
to
respond
at
the
administrative
level
in
this
very
case
at
the
previous
disciplinary
proceeding
which
resulted
in
the
suspension.
initially,
two
or
three
charges
were
made
against
him
and
what
was
proposed
was
he
would
be
discharged.
but
as
a
result
of
his
lengthy
submission,
the
regional
director
concluded
that
only
one
of
the
charges
was
sustained
and
instead
of
discharging,
he
only
suspended
him
for
60
days.
so
that
we
think
at
the
result
could
well
have
been
different
in
this
case
if
he
had
submitted
to
the
regional
director
which
we
think
was
his
obligation,
all
of
the
material
on
which
he
now
relies
contained
in
this
appendix
which
was
submitted
for
the
first
time
in
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
could
have
confronted
his
accusers
mr.
justice
at
the
hearing
that
he
would
have
been
given
before
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes!
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
before
his
agency.
but
after,
if
the
agency
discharges
him
and
he
then
exercises
his
right
to
appeal
either
at
a
higher
level
of
the
agency
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
at
the
original
hearing,
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
confront
his
accusers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
not
a
hearing,
it
is
an
informal
proceeding.
it
can
be
an
oral
submission,
but
he
does
have
the
full
right,
a
full
right
to
confront
his
accusers
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
after
he
has
discharge
and
if
as
result
of
that
hearing
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
civil
service
commission
has
given.
i
might
say,
i
say
that
i
will
be
prepared
to
defend
it,
the
procedure,
even
if
that
was
not
in
it
but
that
is
in
it
and
i
think
at
least
without
getting
to
the
more
difficult
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
would
be
valid
without
it,
here,
he
has
and
he
gets
a
full
hearing.
he
can
cross
examine,
be
confronted
by
it
afterwards.
and
if
he
prevails
on
that
hearing,
he
is
not
only
reinstated
but
gets
his
backpay.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
other
parts
of
the
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
pickering
case
mr.
justice,
it
seems
to
me.
in
the
pickering
case,
this
court
recognized
that
speech
may
be
a
basis
for
a
discharge
of
a
government
employee
and
it
held
within
the
particular
facts
of
that
case
what
the
man
did
which
was
writing
this
letter
to
the
newspaper
that
that
itself
was
not
sufficient
in
that
case
but
the
court
recognized
that
there
may
be
incidents
of
speech
which
justify
the
discharge
of
a
government
employee.
indeed,
indeed
in
this
very
case.
and
this
very
case,
the
district
court
recognized
that
speech
maybe
a
ground
for
discharging
a
government
employee.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
mr.
justice
but
that’s
not
the
practice.
that’s
not
what
happened.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
could
not
say
that.
i
think
that
might
be
under
the
present
statute
--
detrimental
to
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
again,
it
is
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
these
are
all
questions,
these
are
all
questions
which
have
to
be
battled
out
first
at
the
administrative
level
and
then
in
a
hearing.
if
he
were
discharged
for
making
that
single
statement,
it
may
be
that
ultimately
the
civil
service
commission
would
hold
that
that
was
not
enough
to
constitute
conduct
detrimental
to
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
it
would
depend
on
the
context
in
which
he
was
saying.
i
mean,
if
what
he
said
at
a
public
meeting
of
all
the
employees
and
say,
“surprise!
surprise!
my
boss
was
sober
yesterday.”
but
it
seems
to
me
that
may
be
a
different
thing.
and
i
think
this
goes
to
the
essence
of
the
prohibitions
dealing
with
the
speech
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
in
speaking
in
terms
of
chilling
effect,
there
is
got
to
be
something
more,
something
specific
and
i
do
not
think
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
in
terms
of
the
precise
conduct
involved.
i
don’t
really
think
that
any
responsible
government
employee
can
fairly
contend
that
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights
are
chilled
because
mr.
kennedy
is
fired
for
making
these
kinds
of
statements
against
his
superiors.
and
that
is
the
issue
what
seems
to
me
and
this
court
in
the
pickering
case
recognized
that
it
is
impossible
to
specify
in
detail
exactly
what
every
particular
situation
might
be.
speeches
is
difficult
to
predict
and
all
you
can
do
is
apply
it
in
the
particular
circumstances
if
the
application
is
an
improper
one,
there
is
always
a
way
of
correction
through
the
appeals
with
de
novo
hearing
that
is
provided
under
the
procedural
system.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
as
a
specific
oeo
regulation
which
we
have
quoted
in
pages
42
and
43
of
our
brief
which
states
that
employees
should
avoid
any
action
which
might
result
or
give
the
appearance
of
and,
i
quote,
“affecting
adversely
the
confidence
of
the
public
in
the
integrity
of
oeo
and
the
government.”
while
the
regulation
does
not
in
terms
refer
to
speech.
it
seems
to
us
that
action
is
a
broad
enough
phrase
and
certainly
i
find
it
where
there
is
amazing
--
the
suggestion
that
there
is
an
absolute
immunity,
a
government
employee
can
say
anything
he
pleases
under
this
statute.
and
because
of
speech,
he
is
somehow
not
subject
to
discipline.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
has
held
in
this
case.
now,
the
claimant’s
been
--
the
suggestion
was
made
by
mr.
justice
white
that
perhaps
this
thing
involves
a
denial
of
liberty
and
this
is
distinguished
from
property.
i
think
the
answer
that
the
liberty,
any
liberty
here
is
the
fact
that
he
is
branded
if
you
want
to
call
that
as
a
man
who
has
done
bad
things
and
maybe
difficult
for
him
to
find
a
job.
he
can
fully
protect
himself
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
certainly
through
the
hearing
that
will
subsequently
be
conducted
before
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
hearing
mr.
justice
has
been
delayed
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
case.
now,
i
could
say
that
i
understand,
i
had
this
morning
checked
with
the
chicago
office
of
the
civil
service
commission
where
the
hearing
would
be
held
and
i
was
told
that
in
fact
the
hearing
has
been
terminated
because
of
the
fact
that
mr.
kennedy
is
now
back
on
payroll.
but
the
hearing
was
delayed
but
if
things
had
proceeded
normally,
the
hearing
would
have
been
held
and
mr.
kennedy
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
try
out
before
the
civil
service
commission,
all
of
these
defenses
which
he
now
asserts
exist
to
the
charges
made
against
him.
i
would
just
like
to
respond
the
contention
that
was
made
that
in
the
answer,
mr.
kennedy
file
to
the
proposed
discharge
that
he
denies
all
of
these
facts.
that
is
set
forth
at
page
62
of
the
appendix
and
there
is
no
denial
of
the
fact.
the
only
statement
is
that
mr.
kennedy
is
entitled
to
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing
filed
prior
to
any
adverse
action
being
taken
against
him.
the
thing
then
summarizes
what
mr.
kennedy
believes
the
hearing
should
consist
of
and
that
says
the
present
adverse
action
procedure
fails
in
substantial
ways
to
provide
all
these
rudimentary
elements
required
for
a
due
process
hearing
that
therefore,
the
proceedings
are
invalid
and
null
and
void.
this
is
not
a
denial,
this
is
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
mr.
justice
is
with
respect
to
the
second
set
of
charges.
that
it
seems
to
me
is
in
response
to
the
contention
that
this
is
a
denial
of
his
rights
of
free
speech
thing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
holding
unconstitutional,
certain
provisions
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
governing
the
discipline
primarily
for
discharge
of
non-probationary
federal
employees.
the
case
brings
before
the
court
two
constitutional
questions.
one,
relating
to
the
procedures
followed
in
terminating
such
employees
and
the
other
relating
to
the
validity
of
the
standards
for
their
termination.
under
the
statute
and
the
implementing
regulations
of
the
civil
service
commission,
a
non-probationary
federal
employee
may
be
removed
from
office
after
being
given
a
written
statement
of
the
charges,
an
opportunity
to
reply
in
writing
or
orally
and
to
submit
affidavits
and
the
receipt
of
a
written
decision
by
the
officer
effecting
the
termination.
the
statute
however
explicitly
provides
that
a
hearing
prior
to
termination
is
not
required.
under
the
civil
service
commission
regulations
however,
the
employee
following
such
termination
has
the
right
to
a
hearing
even
before
the
agency
or
before
the
civil
service
commission
and
the
first
question
presented
is
whether
this
statutory
practice
which
in
effect
defers
the
evidentiary
hearing
to
an
appeal
following
the
termination
satisfies
the
due
process
standards
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
statute
itself
provides
that
a
federal
employee
may
be
removed
only
for
such
cause
as
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
again,
the
civil
service
commission
has
implemented
this
rather
general
standard
through
some
regulations
which
i
will
come
to
shortly.
the
substantive
question
in
the
case
is
whether
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
when
this
provision
is
applied
to
terminate
the
service
of
a
non-probationary
government
employee
because
of
statements
he
has
made,
public
statements
accusing
his
superiors
of
misfeasance
and
criminal
activity
and
which
in
the
judgment
of
his
superiors
effectively
undermines
the
ability
of
the
agency
to
performs
its
services.
now
the
court
in
this
case
invalidated
the
statute
on
its
face
on
the
basis
of
granting
summary
judgment
for
the
appellees
and
under
civil
practices,
the
validity
of
that
action
maybe
just
be
tested
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
most
strongly
supporting
the
government
and
accordingly,
i
shall
state
the
facts
of
this
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
there
were
before,
it
isn’t
explicit.
i
would
assume
mr.
justice
they
were
before
the
court
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
but
summary
judgment
was
granted
against
us.
summary
judgment
was
granted
against
us
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
considering
the
propriety
of
that
action,
we
can
properly
look
to
the
evidence
that
would
support
our
case,
not
the
evidence
that
would
support
their
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes.
yes.
but
the
evidence
before
the
court
included
much
of
the
material
that
was
the
basis
for
the
discharge
of
mr.
kennedy.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
one
other
thing.
in
their
brief,
the
appellees
at
pages
2
and
3
have
stated
that
much
of
what
the
government
has
set
forth
as
its
statement
of
the
case
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
we
disagree
with
that
and
accordingly
in
my
presentation,
whenever
we
get
to
any
controverted
materials,
i
will
give
record
references
to
the
appendix
which
support
the
statements
i
am
making.
the
appellee,
mr.
kennedy
at
the
time
of
these
events
was
a
field
representative
in
the
chicago
office
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity.
he
was
a
fairly
important
man
there.
he
had
a
government
grade
of
gs-12
which
is
in
the
intermediate
range
and
paid
at
that
time
$16,000.00.
as
explained
in
the
instructions
that
oeo
puts
out
to
its
field
representatives
which
are
quoted
in
the
record
in
the
affidavit
of
the
regional
director.
the
field
representative
was
a
particularly
crucial
person
in
the
operation
of
oeo.
oeo
of
course,
its
basic
function
is
to
channel
funds
to
various
community
groups
to
enable
them
to
improve
their
life
economically.
and
his
job
was
to
have
contact
with
the
community
action
groups
to
talk
with
them,
to
explain
to
the
community
action
groups
what
oeo
is
doing,
what
its
policies
were
and
to
be
sure
that
these
policies
were
being
carried
out
in
the
implementation
of
the
programs
by
the
community
action
groups.
as
oeo
stated
itself,
this
man
as
a
practical
matter
was
viewed
by
the
community
groups
as
oeo.
his
job
as
i
said
was
to
explain
these
policy
decisions.
that
material
is
set
forth
at
pages
24
and
25
of
the
appendix.
and
mr.
kennedy
has
twice
been
subjected
to
disciplinary
action
in
this
situation.
in
the
first
instance
in
november
of
1971,
he
was
charged
by
the
regional
director
with
various
acts
of
misconduct.
he
replied
in
writing
a
lengthy
reply
which
is
not
included
in
the
appendix.
he
had
an
oral
presentation
before
the
regional
director
and
following
this
in
january
1972,
the
regional
director
concluded
that
only
one
of
the
several
charges
made
against
him
was
sustained
by
the
evidence,
and
instead
of
terminating
his
services
as
he
had
originally
proposed,
instead,
he
suspended
him
the
60
days.
i
just
mentioned
in
passing
because
i
think,
this
is
an
indication
of
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
appellees
say
that
this
was
outrageous
because
he
was
suspended
for
60
days
on
the
basis
of
a
single
telephone
conversation
that
took
place
11
months
before.
well,
the
reason
for
the
11
months
before
is
that
the
charges
against
him
which
led
to
this
suspension
covered
a
period
of
almost
a
year
and
this
was
the
only
one
of
the
charges
that
was
sustained.
but
the
single
telephone
conversation
was
a
phone
conversation
he
made
to
officials
of
one
these
community
action
groups
in
which
he
told
them
they
should
get
rid
of
the
existing
board
of
directors
and
get
themselves
a
new
board
of
directors
which
they
could
control.
he
did
this
inspite
of
the
fact
that
there
were
specific
instructions
from
oeo
set
forth
at
pages
38
to
40
of
the
appendix
that
field
representatives
were
to
keep
their
hands
off
the
internal
operations
of
these
community
action
groups.
there
were
allowed
then
to
make
their
own
decisions
even
though
they
seemed
wrong
to
maintain
an
arms-length
posture,
and
even
though
he
had
previously
been
warned
against
such
activities
when
he
had
a
previous
situation.
i
just
may
say
one
thing
well,
i
think
this
illustrates
very
dramatically
the
kind
of
disrupted
effect
this
sort
of
conduct
would
have.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
now
like
to
come
to
the
second
set
of
charges
on
the
basis
of
which
mr.
kennedy
was
discharged
from
federal
service.
this
was
served
upon
him
in
february
1972
approximately
three
weeks
after
his
previous
notice
of
his
suspension.
basically,
these
charges
related
to
two
different
activities.
one,
related
to
certain
statements
he
made
with
relation
to
a
problem
had
arisen
in
chicago
relating
to
the
indians
in
chicago.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reasons
are
important.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
this
extent
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
claims
here
is
that
a
hearing
was
required
in
advance
of
termination.
under
the
statutory
provisions,
this
man
is
given
an
opportunity
as
told
what
the
charges
are
against
him
has
the
opportunity
to
respond
both
orally
and
in
writing
and
to
submit
affidavits.
and
then
if
he
is
discharged,
he
has
a
right
to
full
hearing
with
the
complete
panoply
of
procedures
after
that
discharge.
in
this
case,
he
was
given
rather
very
specific
charges
of
certain
improprieties
and
he
did
not
submit
any
material
at
all.
so
to
that
extent,
we
think
the
facts
are
significant.
in
addition,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
facts
are
quite
significant
in
evaluating
his
claim
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
an
infringement
of
his
first
amendment
rights
because
our
basic
position
on
that
is
that
a
conscientious
government
employee
could
really
have
not
doubt
that
the
kind
of
things
he
is
alleged
to
have
done
would
be
detrimental
to
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
now,
that’s
the
reason
i
am
stressing
these
facts
because
i
think
the
case
has
to
be
brought
into
a
proper
postures.
now,
the
two
allegations
with
respect
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
working
on
a
controversial
field
mr.
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly,
it’s
controversial
but
mr.
justice,
his
role,
his
role
was
supporting
oeo
in
this
controversy.
his
job
was
to
represent
oeo
and
to
explain
to
the
community
what
oeo
is
doing
and
to
try
to
persuade
the
community
that
it
should
accept
oeo’s
treatment
of
this
problem.
what
he
did
instead
of
doing
that,
he
turned
around
and
made
a
number
a
very
serious
and
we
think
unjustified
attacks
on
oeo
and
on
his
superiors.
attacks
which
according
to
the
affidavit
of
the
regional
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
with
all
due
respect
mr.
justice,
i
don’t
think
that
was
his
function
as
an
employee
of
oeo.
if
he
had
complaints
about
oeo
about
the
way
the
program
was
being
administered,
it
was
his
obligation
we
think
to
make
those
complaints
through
channels,
not
to
make
statements
to
the
press,
not
to
make
at
public
meeting
or
the
union
meeting.
let
me
tell
you
what
he
did
for
example
he
said,
he
said
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
in
terms
of
what
happened
most
assuredly
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
tell
you
exactly
what
the
charges
against
him
were.
first
of
all,
he
said
that
the
regional
director
and
his
executive
assistant
had
either
bribed
or
tempted
to
bribe
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
indian
community
in
chicago
by
offering
this
man
a
grant
of
$100,000.00,
if
this
man
in
turn
would
make
a
statement,
give
a
written
statement
against
mr.
kennedy
and
another
employee
who
was
active
in
the
union.
he
made
this
charge
at
a
union
meeting,
and
this
charge
was
repeated
in
a
newspaper
report
of
the
meeting.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
true
according
to
the
--
no,
no,
i
am
sorry.
he
claimed
it’s
true.
the
regional
director
found
it
was
not
true,
found
it
was
not
true.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
he
conducted
a
press
conference
in
the
lobby
of
the
building
where
oeo.
as
he
conducted
it
into
the
lobby
because
he
had
been
refused
permission
after
his
suspension
to
hold
a
press
conference
in
the
oeo
offices
where
he
wanted
and
he
got
handed
out
a
press
release
and
set
forth
at
pages
44
and
45
of
the
record
in
which
he
accused
the
regional
director
of
breaking
treaties
with
the
indians.
it
was
a
newspaper
story
covering
that.
in
addition
to
that,
he
made
an
accusation
against
an
oeo
official
that
they
had
violated
the
oeo
conflict
of
interest
standards
by
entering
into
an
insurance
contract
with
a
company
with
which
the
husband
of
this
woman
was
connected.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
he
was
told,
he
was
told
in
this
notice
of
charges
that
he
could
submit
either
written
answers
with
affidavits
and
an
oral
hearing,
he
did
neither,
all
he
did
was
file
an
answer
which
is
set
forth
at
page
62
of
the
record
in
which
he
said
he
wanted
a
hearing
before
an
impartial
hearing
officer
and
he
said
that
applying
this
statute
to
punish
him,
to
discharge
him
on
the
basis
of
statements,
speech
he
had
made
violated
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
following
the
receipt
of
this,
he
did
not
submit
anything.
further
than
that,
the
regional
director
informed
mr.
kennedy
in
writing
that
the
charges
against
was
sustained,
directed
his
removal
and
informed
mr.
kennedy
that
he
had
the
right
to
appeal
that
either
to
the
agency,
within
the
agency
itself
or
to
the
civil
service
commission.
he
elected
to
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission.
i
just
like
briefly
to
refer
to
the
affidavit
of
the
regional
director
submitted
in
the
district
court
in
opposition
to
their
motion
for
a
stay
which
would
have
the
effect
of
putting
mr.
kennedy
--
keeping
mr.
kennedy
at
work
and
he
explained
in
considerable
detail
what
had
led
to
mr.
kennedy’s
discharge.
and
that
at
the
end
of
bottom
of
page
32
and
the
top
of
page
33,
after
first
pointing
out
that
he
recognized
the
importance
of
free
and
open
discussion
within
the
agency,
and
he
also
recognized
the
importance
of
constructive
criticism
within
the
agency
but
he
said
however,
when
the
criticisms
take
the
form
of
malicious
personal
attacks
made
publicly
by
a
field
representative
who
is
viewed
as
oeo
by
the
community
at
large,
when
the
criticism
result
in
a
breakdown
and
the
necessary
maintenance
of
discipline
produced
serious
disharmony
among
co-workers
and
loss
of
morale
and
destroy
ongoing
efforts
of
this
office
to
serve
the
poor
and
the
disadvantaged
then
the
efficiency
of
government
has
dealt
a
severe
blow.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
bottom
of
page
32.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
also
pointed
out
at
the
top
of
the
page
that
prior
to
the
issuance
of
mr.
kennedy’s
press
release,
the
office
had
been
attempting
to
put
together
a
coalition
among
the
indians
of
chicago
that
would
create
an
organization
that
was
able
to
receive
and
handle
a
substantial
grant.
but
after
his,
mr.
kennedy’s
attack
on
oeo
as
he
put
it
the
coalition
fell
apart
and
as
of
the
time
of
filing
of
the
affidavit,
he
stated
that
had
not
been
able
to
put
together
another
coalition
and
process
the
grant.
in
the
district
court
as
i
have
indicated,
the
court
first
held
that
the
statute
was
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
because
of
its
failure
under
the
statute
and
the
procedures
to
give
mr.
kennedy
an
adversary
full
hearing
before
his
termination
and
on
the
basis
of
that
conclusion
directed
the
mr.
kennedy
be
reinstated
and
he
has
been
reinstated.
the
court
also
said
that
although
he
had
recognized
that
the
conduct
of
the
speech
which
was
the
basis
for
mr.
kennedy’s
discharge
did
provide
a
basis
for
disciplinary
action,
nevertheless,
the
statute
it
held
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
said
this
vague
language
is
likely
to
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
other
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights
and
it
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
in
the
regulations
and
this
is
the
language
from
7
(a)
of
our
jurisdictional
statement
of
the
opinion
insofar
as
they
have
construed
to
regulate
the
speech
of
competitive
service
employees,
a
very
broad
injunction.
now,
coming
to
the
merits
of
the
case
the
statutory
argument.
first,
as
with
respect
to
the
procedural
due
process
issue,
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
of
1912
was
enacted
to
provide
substantial
protections
for
federal
employees.
prior
to
that
time,
federal
employees
had
virtually
no
job
protection
at
all.
they
were
subject
almost
to
dismissal
at
the
whim
or
the
caprice
of
their
superiors.
and
what
congress
did
in
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
which
is
keep
provisions
of
which
in
that
present
form
is
set
forth
at
page
37
of
the
brief
was
to
do
two-three
things
--
really
two
things.
the
first
was
it
provides
in
the
first
sentence
that
an
individual
in
the
competitive
service
may
be
removed
or
suspended
without
pay
only
for
such
cause
as
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
for
the
first
time
wrote
into
law
a
job
protection
for
federal
employees.
they
could
only
be
dismissed
for
cause
and
only
such
cause
would
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
then
it
provided
certain
procedural
protections.
the
employee
was
to
get
notice
of
the
charges,
had
a
reasonable
time
to
file
a
written
answer
to
the
charges
and
affidavits,
and
was
entitled
for
a
written
decision.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
examination
of
witnesses,
trial
or
hearing
is
not
required
but
may
be
provided
in
the
discretion
of
the
individual
directing
the
removal
or
suspension
without
pay.
and
what
congress
has
done
is
to
leave
it
to
the
individual
agency
to
decide
whether
or
not
in
following
its
discharge
procedures
it
gives
the
man
a
hearing
prior
to
his
termination.
at
the
present
time,
eight
agencies
do
provide
for
such
pre-termination
hearings.
they
employ
approximately
10%
of
the
federal
workforce
but
the
statistics
that
we
have
from
the
civil
service
commission
indicate
that's
a
much
smaller
percentage
of
disciplinary
proceedings.
a
vast
bulk
of
government
agencies
in
number
covering
the
vast
bulk
of
federal
employees
do
not
provide
for
any
pre-discharge
hearing.
what
they
do
provide
for
is
the
and
under
the
regulations
of
the
civil
service
commission,
a
30-day
notice
of
charges,
full
statement
of
the
charges,
an
opportunity
either
to
reply
in
writing
or
orally
to
submit
affidavits,
the
opportunity
of
the
man
to
examine
the
civil
service
files
containing
the
information
in
which
the
charges
are
based
and
an
opportunity
in
a
written
report.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
of
that,
not
of
that
stage
mr.
justice.
not
of
that
stage.
but,
after
if
he
is
discharged,
he
has
a
full
hearing
with
a
complete
right
to
confront
all
the
witnesses,
a
transcript
was
taken
to
produced
his
own
witness,
superiored
by
counsel.
and
if
that
was
the
result
of
that
hearing
which
is
i
have
indicated
maybe
either
before
the
agency
of
the
civil
service
commission,
if
as
a
result
of
that
hearing,
he
is
ordered
reinstated,
if
his
discharged
is
set
aside,
he
gets
full
backpay
under
the
statute
for
the
period
he
was
out
of
work.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
over
the
years
and
most
recently
in
the
cafeteria
workers
case
that
without
legislation
unless
there
is
some
specific
legislative
provision,
a
government
employee
may
be
summarily
discharged.
here,
we
do
have
a
statute.
we
have
a
statute
which
provides
that
before
he
can
be
discharged,
it
has
to
be
for
cause
and
after
certain
provisions
specified
by
the
statute.
the
procedural
due
process
as
this
court
as
many
times
stated
is
a
flexible
concept.
say,
you
do
not
have
fixed
rules,
you
got
to
weigh
competing
interests
in
this
situation.
here,
we
have
two
competing
interests.
on
the
one
hand
is
the
obvious
interest
of
a
government
employee
not
to
have
his
federal
employment
finally
terminated
without
procedures
in
which
he
can
fairly
present
his
case.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
very
strong
government
interest
of
removing
incompetent,
unsuitable
employees
from
the
public
payroll
so
that
the
government
can
proceed
with
its
business
effectively
and
expeditiously
and
obviously,
if
a
pre-termination
hearing
is
required
in
every
case,
this
is
inevitably
bound
to
delay
the
proceedings.
it
seems
to
me
that
itself
evident
that
if
in
every
case,
an
employee
has
the
option
for
a
hearing,
many
employees
knowing
of
the
delay,
is
just
going
to
request
a
hearing.
some
statistics
that
i
referred
to
in
an
article
by
professor
merrill
that
is
quoted
in
our
opponent’s
brief
in
the
59
university
of
virginia
law
review
points
out
that
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
government
disciplinary
actions
are
taken
to
hearing.
the
figures
we
have,
it
is
something
like
maybe
10%
or
something
in
that
range.
and
inevitably,
this
would
lead
to
a
proliferation
of
these
hearings
to
delays
in
discharging
incompetent
or
unsuitable
government
employees.
now,
we
think
that
the
due
process
requires
no
more
in
this
situation
than
is
done.
that
is
the
employee
has
--
this
is
not
a
case
where
someone
is
cutoff
with
a
letter
saying
you
are
terminated
today.
the
employee
has
the
opportunity
to
present
informally
to
be
sure
but
has
the
opportunity
to
present
to
his
agency
any
facts
that
he
believes
mitigate
against
the
proposal
or
show
that
it
its
uncertainty,
for
example
he
can
show
that
perhaps
the
whole
thing
rests
on
a
mistake.
maybe
the
facts
are
wrong.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
be
making
that
same
argument
mr.
justice
but
i
do
not
have
to
make
that
argument
because
here
congress
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that’s
all
the
government
did
but
that
is
correct.
but
here
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
i
am
saying
mr.
justice
is
that
i
would
be
prepared
to
defend
the
narrowest
statute
but
in
this
case
certainly
under
this
procedure
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
defend
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
defend
it
but
i
do
not
have
to
attempt
to
justify
that
position
because
here
we
do
have
the
complete
de
novo
hearing.
and
if
i
may
point
out
mr.
justice,
this
is
not
just
an
idle
thing,
his
ability
to
respond
at
the
administrative
level
in
this
very
case
at
the
previous
disciplinary
proceeding
which
resulted
in
the
suspension.
initially,
two
or
three
charges
were
made
against
him
and
what
was
proposed
was
he
would
be
discharged.
but
as
a
result
of
his
lengthy
submission,
the
regional
director
concluded
that
only
one
of
the
charges
was
sustained
and
instead
of
discharging,
he
only
suspended
him
for
60
days.
so
that
we
think
at
the
result
could
well
have
been
different
in
this
case
if
he
had
submitted
to
the
regional
director
which
we
think
was
his
obligation,
all
of
the
material
on
which
he
now
relies
contained
in
this
appendix
which
was
submitted
for
the
first
time
in
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
could
have
confronted
his
accusers
mr.
justice
at
the
hearing
that
he
would
have
been
given
before
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes!
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
before
his
agency.
but
after,
if
the
agency
discharges
him
and
he
then
exercises
his
right
to
appeal
either
at
a
higher
level
of
the
agency
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
at
the
original
hearing,
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
confront
his
accusers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
not
a
hearing,
it
is
an
informal
proceeding.
it
can
be
an
oral
submission,
but
he
does
have
the
full
right,
a
full
right
to
confront
his
accusers
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
after
he
has
discharge
and
if
as
result
of
that
hearing
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
civil
service
commission
has
given.
i
might
say,
i
say
that
i
will
be
prepared
to
defend
it,
the
procedure,
even
if
that
was
not
in
it
but
that
is
in
it
and
i
think
at
least
without
getting
to
the
more
difficult
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
would
be
valid
without
it,
here,
he
has
and
he
gets
a
full
hearing.
he
can
cross
examine,
be
confronted
by
it
afterwards.
and
if
he
prevails
on
that
hearing,
he
is
not
only
reinstated
but
gets
his
backpay.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
other
parts
of
the
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
pickering
case
mr.
justice,
it
seems
to
me.
in
the
pickering
case,
this
court
recognized
that
speech
may
be
a
basis
for
a
discharge
of
a
government
employee
and
it
held
within
the
particular
facts
of
that
case
what
the
man
did
which
was
writing
this
letter
to
the
newspaper
that
that
itself
was
not
sufficient
in
that
case
but
the
court
recognized
that
there
may
be
incidents
of
speech
which
justify
the
discharge
of
a
government
employee.
indeed,
indeed
in
this
very
case.
and
this
very
case,
the
district
court
recognized
that
speech
maybe
a
ground
for
discharging
a
government
employee.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
mr.
justice
but
that’s
not
the
practice.
that’s
not
what
happened.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
could
not
say
that.
i
think
that
might
be
under
the
present
statute
--
detrimental
to
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
again,
it
is
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
these
are
all
questions,
these
are
all
questions
which
have
to
be
battled
out
first
at
the
administrative
level
and
then
in
a
hearing.
if
he
were
discharged
for
making
that
single
statement,
it
may
be
that
ultimately
the
civil
service
commission
would
hold
that
that
was
not
enough
to
constitute
conduct
detrimental
to
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
it
would
depend
on
the
context
in
which
he
was
saying.
i
mean,
if
what
he
said
at
a
public
meeting
of
all
the
employees
and
say,
“surprise!
surprise!
my
boss
was
sober
yesterday.”
but
it
seems
to
me
that
may
be
a
different
thing.
and
i
think
this
goes
to
the
essence
of
the
prohibitions
dealing
with
the
speech
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
in
speaking
in
terms
of
chilling
effect,
there
is
got
to
be
something
more,
something
specific
and
i
do
not
think
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
in
terms
of
the
precise
conduct
involved.
i
don’t
really
think
that
any
responsible
government
employee
can
fairly
contend
that
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights
are
chilled
because
mr.
kennedy
is
fired
for
making
these
kinds
of
statements
against
his
superiors.
and
that
is
the
issue
what
seems
to
me
and
this
court
in
the
pickering
case
recognized
that
it
is
impossible
to
specify
in
detail
exactly
what
every
particular
situation
might
be.
speeches
is
difficult
to
predict
and
all
you
can
do
is
apply
it
in
the
particular
circumstances
if
the
application
is
an
improper
one,
there
is
always
a
way
of
correction
through
the
appeals
with
de
novo
hearing
that
is
provided
under
the
procedural
system.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
as
a
specific
oeo
regulation
which
we
have
quoted
in
pages
42
and
43
of
our
brief
which
states
that
employees
should
avoid
any
action
which
might
result
or
give
the
appearance
of
and,
i
quote,
“affecting
adversely
the
confidence
of
the
public
in
the
integrity
of
oeo
and
the
government.”
while
the
regulation
does
not
in
terms
refer
to
speech.
it
seems
to
us
that
action
is
a
broad
enough
phrase
and
certainly
i
find
it
where
there
is
amazing
--
the
suggestion
that
there
is
an
absolute
immunity,
a
government
employee
can
say
anything
he
pleases
under
this
statute.
and
because
of
speech,
he
is
somehow
not
subject
to
discipline.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
has
held
in
this
case.
now,
the
claimant’s
been
--
the
suggestion
was
made
by
mr.
justice
white
that
perhaps
this
thing
involves
a
denial
of
liberty
and
this
is
distinguished
from
property.
i
think
the
answer
that
the
liberty,
any
liberty
here
is
the
fact
that
he
is
branded
if
you
want
to
call
that
as
a
man
who
has
done
bad
things
and
maybe
difficult
for
him
to
find
a
job.
he
can
fully
protect
himself
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
certainly
through
the
hearing
that
will
subsequently
be
conducted
before
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
hearing
mr.
justice
has
been
delayed
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
case.
now,
i
could
say
that
i
understand,
i
had
this
morning
checked
with
the
chicago
office
of
the
civil
service
commission
where
the
hearing
would
be
held
and
i
was
told
that
in
fact
the
hearing
has
been
terminated
because
of
the
fact
that
mr.
kennedy
is
now
back
on
payroll.
but
the
hearing
was
delayed
but
if
things
had
proceeded
normally,
the
hearing
would
have
been
held
and
mr.
kennedy
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
try
out
before
the
civil
service
commission,
all
of
these
defenses
which
he
now
asserts
exist
to
the
charges
made
against
him.
i
would
just
like
to
respond
the
contention
that
was
made
that
in
the
answer,
mr.
kennedy
file
to
the
proposed
discharge
that
he
denies
all
of
these
facts.
that
is
set
forth
at
page
62
of
the
appendix
and
there
is
no
denial
of
the
fact.
the
only
statement
is
that
mr.
kennedy
is
entitled
to
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing
filed
prior
to
any
adverse
action
being
taken
against
him.
the
thing
then
summarizes
what
mr.
kennedy
believes
the
hearing
should
consist
of
and
that
says
the
present
adverse
action
procedure
fails
in
substantial
ways
to
provide
all
these
rudimentary
elements
required
for
a
due
process
hearing
that
therefore,
the
proceedings
are
invalid
and
null
and
void.
this
is
not
a
denial,
this
is
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
mr.
justice
is
with
respect
to
the
second
set
of
charges.
that
it
seems
to
me
is
in
response
to
the
contention
that
this
is
a
denial
of
his
rights
of
free
speech
thing.
