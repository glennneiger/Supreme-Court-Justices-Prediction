justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
i
read
through
the
record
in
the
case
that
the
appendix
and
i
noticed
that
government
supplied
a
number
of
affidavits
and
the
like
in
connection
with
its
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
now
looking
through
the
docket
entries
in
the
district
court,
it
was
not
clear
to
me
since
there
are
none
included
in
the
appendix
whether
that
government
had
those
same
affidavits
carry
over
for
consideration
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
have
to
have
been
evidence
that
was
before
the
court
had
said?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnhill,
maybe
you
can
try
to
answer
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
friedman.
you
won
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
so
i
take
it.
it
is
conceded
that
as
to
any
material
fact
that’s
in
dispute
if
there
was
one
version
by
the
government
and
one
by
your
client,
you
have
to
take
the
government’s
version
and
were
all
of
the
submissions
of
the
government
in
connection
to
file
originally
with
its
motion
to
dismiss
before
the
court
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
if
you
take
the
lower
court’s
view,
neither
side
would
be
entitled
to
state
any
facts
since
the
factual
background
was
irrelevant.
but
since
we
might
take
a
different
view,
i
suppose
we
have
got
to
take
the
view
that
on
material,
what
facts
we
conceive
to
be
material,
we
would
have
to
buy
the
government’s
version
since
you
won
on
a
summary
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
certain
procedural
and
substantive
rules
governing
federal
employees
embodied
in
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
and
in
regulations
promulgated
by
the
civil
service
commission.
because
we
have
a
fractionated
court
on
one
of
the
issues,
it
may
take
a
little
longer
than
usual
to
describe
the
situation.
prior
to
the
events
leading
to
this
suit,
appellee,
kennedy,
was
a
non-probationary
employee
in
the
competitive
civil
service.
he
was
dismissed
from
his
position
in
the
office
of
economic
opportunity,
for
a
allegedly
having
made
recklessly
false
and
defamatory
statements
about
follow
employees.
although
advised
of
his
right
pursuant
to
his
agency’s
and
civil
service
commission
regulations
to
reply
to
the
charges
against
him.
he
brought
this
suit
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
a
three-judge
district
court
accepted
his
contention
that
the
standards
and
procedures
established
by
and
under
lloyd-la
follette
act
for
the
removal
of
non-probationary
federal
employees
from
the
federal
service,
deny
them
procedural
due
process,
because
they
failed
to
provide
for
a
trial
type
hearing
before
an
impartial
hearing
officer
prior
to
removal.
the
district
court
also
accepted
appellee’s
contention
that
the
act’s
removal
standards
were
unconstitutionally
vague
and
overbroad,
because
they
failed
to
furnish
sufficiently
precise
guidelines
as
to
what
kind
of
speech
may
be
made
the
basis
for
removal.
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
provides
for
the
removal
of
non-probationary
federal
employees
only
for
such
cause
as
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
the
act
further
requires
the
employing
agency
to
give
the
employee
a
written
notice
of
the
proposed
removal
action
and
a
reasonable
time
to
final
written
answer
with
supporting
affidavits,
but
the
examination
of
witnesses,
trial,
or
hearing
is
not
required.
civil
service
commission
and
oeo
regulations
enlarge
the
statutory
procedural
protections
by
requiring
30
days
notice
and
by
entitling
the
employee
to
post
trial
type
hearings
on
an
administrative
appeal.
an
employee
receives
full
back
pay
if
he
has
re-instated.
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
regulations
are
vague
or
overboard,
six
of
us
agree
in
an
opinion,
which
i
--
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion,
which
i
have
authored
and
filed
with
the
clerk
that
there
is
no
constitutional
infirmity
in
these
regulations.
on
the
procedural
due
process
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
procedures
provided
by
the
regulations
and
by
the
act
for
hearing
prior
to
and
after
suspension
or
discharge.
in
an
opinion
in
which
i
have
authored
and
which
only
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart
joined,
we
conclude
that
in
granting
federal
employees
like
appellee,
the
right
not
to
be
discharged
except
for
cause,
and
at
the
same
time
conditioning
that
grant
by
withholding
the
procedural
guarantees
to
which
appellee
insists
he
has
the
right.
congress
did
not
create
a
property
interest
requiring
procedural
protection
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
beyond
that
already
afforded.
we
also
conclude
that
existing
post
termination
hearing
procedures
adequately
protect
the
liberty
interest
to
federal
employees
and
not
being
wrongfully
stigmatized
by
untrue
and
unsupported
administrative
charges.
finally
we
conclude
that
the
act’s
removal
standard
is
neither
impermissibly
vague,
nor
overbroad.
since
it
describes
as
explicitly
as
is
feasible,
the
wide
variety
of
factual
situations
in
which
employee
conduct
including
speech
might
justify
removal
for
cause.
mr.
justice
powell,
who
mr.
justice
blackmun
joins,
agrees
with
the
reasons
given
in
the
opinion
which
i
have
written
on
the
overbreadth
and
vagueness
part
of
the
case.
they
would
hold
that
the,
with
respect
to
the
due
process
issue,
appellee,
as
a
non-probationary
federal
employee,
who
could
be
discharged
only
for
a
cause,
had
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
a
property
interest
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
his
employment
could
not
be
terminated
without
notice
and
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
on
the
other
hand
the
government,
as
an
employer,
must
have
discretion
expeditiously
to
remove
employees
who
hinder
efficient
operation.
since
the
procedures
under
the
act
and
regulations
minimize
the
risk
of
error
in
the
initial
removal
decision
and
provide
for
a
post
removal
evidentiary
hearing
with
reinstatement
and
back
pay,
should
that
decision
be
wrongful.
a
reasonable
accommodation
comporting
with
due
process
is
provided
by
the
existing
system
between
the
competing
interest
of
the
employee
and
the
government
as
employer,
so
they
concur
in
the
judgment
of
reversal.
mr.
justice
white
withhold
that
a
pre-termination
hearing
providing
a
right
to
file
written
objections
to
the
charges
as
required
by
due
processes,
as
is
provided
by
statue.
it
is
not
believed
that
oral
presentation
of
witnesses
and
cross-examination
is
required
at
the
pre-termination
hearing,
but
would
affirm
the
reinstatement
and
back
pay
remedy
of
the
three-judge
court,
because
of
the
failure
to
provide
an
impartial
hearing
examiner
at
pre-termination
hearing.
justice
white
concurs
in
that
portion
of
the
plurality
opinion
reversing
the
three-judge
court’s
injunction
against
the
statue
on
overbreadth
and
vagueness
grounds.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
concludes
that
appellee’s
discharge
for
speaking
out
on
issues
in
the
public
domain
abridged
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
brennan
joined.
he
concludes
that
tenured
government
employment
is
an
important
property
interest
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
and
whose
deprivation
must
be
conditioned
on
a
hearing.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
interest
for
serious,
danger,
or
wrongful
dismiss
and
a
likelihood
that
the
basis
for
the
discharge
will
involve
disputed
factual
issues,
the
hearing
must
include
a
right
to
present
and
cross-examine
witnesses
before
an
impartial
decision
maker.
since
no
exceptional
governmental
interest
and
expediency
has
been
demonstrated,
and
even
a
temporary
wrongful
discharge
may
have
serious
and
irremediable
consequences
for
the
employee,
the
hearing
must
be
held
prior
to
discharge.
well,
the
upshot
of
all
of
these,
the
last
line
so
to
speak,
is
that
judgment
of
district
court
is
reversed.
