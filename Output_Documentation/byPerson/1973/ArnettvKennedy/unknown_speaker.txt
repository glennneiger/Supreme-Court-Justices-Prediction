unknown
speaker
in
respect,
working
in
a
very
controversial
field
here
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
its
controversial
and
the
state
commerce
initial
was
in
1887
perhaps?
unknown
speaker
maybe,
he
was
just
trying
to
save
oeo?
unknown
speaker
it
is
quite
different
from
the
department
of
justice?
unknown
speaker
no
question.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
true?
unknown
speaker
not
to
confront
any
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
i
suppose
you
would
be
making
a
same
argument
if
the
statute
simply
said
that
in
order
to
fire
an
employee,
the
government
must
write
him
a
letter
and
giving
him
a
reason,
but
that
is
all
what
the
government
has
to
do.
that
defines
his
entire
right.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn’t
say
in
that
that
event
there
will
be
no
denial
of
procedural
due
process
if
that’s
all
the
government
did?
unknown
speaker
but
here,
they
do
give
them
more,
but
you
say
they
do
not
need
to
do
anymore
than
the
statute
provides?
unknown
speaker
because
you
say
the
extent,
the
contours,
the
metes
and
bounds
of
his
tenure
are
contained
in
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
the
metes
and
bounds
of
his
tenure
would
be
contained
in
the
kind
of
a
statute
that
my
brother
white
is
suggesting.
that’s
the
point,
isn’t
it?
well,
but
you’re
also
saying
that
is
only
against
the
background
of
an
ultimate
full
trial-type
hearing
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
would
he
defend
it
if
there
were
not
this
de
novo
proceeding
--
unknown
speaker
does
your
position
entail
that
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
let
us
suppose
that
fact
that
it
says
a
government
employee
may
just
be
discharged
at
anytime
for
drunkenness.
all
you
have
to
do
is
write
him
a
letter
and
say
you
are
discharged
because
you
are
drunk.
now,
and
you
would
say
that
if
that
is
the
standard,
nevertheless
that
government
is
free
as
far
as
the
due
process
clause
is
concerned
to
write
him
a
letter
and
say
he
is
drunk
and
he
can
be
fired
just
as
by
that
letter?
you
have
to
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
and
even
though
that
is
the
standard
for
discharge,
drunkenness,
his
right
to
contest
it,
can
be
completely
denied
just
by
writing
him
a
letter.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
if
you
are
wrong
on
this,
you
are
in
a
little
bit
of
trouble,
aren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
you
did
that
in
a
written
answer
to
that
--
unknown
speaker
under
section
3
of
the
lloyd-la
follette?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
just
added
to
it.
you
wanted
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
and
by
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
at
issue
here
then?
unknown
speaker
what
is
--
if
your
client
wins,
what
does
he
get?
unknown
speaker
and
some
backpay?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
if
he
wins,
he
still
must
face
the
merits
of
whether
he
should
be
discharged
or
not.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
basically,
he
would
be
reinstated
to
his
job
with
backpay
whatever
all
this
comes
to
and
he
continues
of
his
job.
i
gather
your
submission
is
until
he
has
been
accorded
the
kind
of
hearing
you
say
you
should
have?
unknown
speaker
and
can’t
be
discharged
or
nor
may
his
salary
be
suspended
until
he
is
actually
found
to
have
committed
the
offenses
of
these
charges?
unknown
speaker
and
then
discharged,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
are
you
asking
for
anymore
of
a
trial-type
hearing
than
in
goldberg
v.
kelly
we
said
or
in
bell
v.
burson?
unknown
speaker
and
what
are
the
elements
of
that
type
hearing?
unknown
speaker
did
bell
versus
burson
provide
that
much
from
the
suspension
of
a
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
really
what
goldberg
said
that
--
unknown
speaker
the
welfare
of
that.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
before
suspension
to
anymore
than
the
finding
of
probable-cause
to
believe
that
these
acts
had
been
committed?
unknown
speaker
it
is
rather
important,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
did
goldberg
give
anymore
than
probable-cause?
unknown
speaker
and
bell
against
burson.
unknown
speaker
but
don’t
you
think
it
really
makes
the
difference
to
what
due
process
requires
if
your
object
of
the
procedure
is
to
determine
probable-cause
rather
than
the
actual
fact?
unknown
speaker
but
due
process
permits
people
to
be
arrested
and
put
in
jail
without
a
probable-cause
established
by
your
heresay?
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnhill,
under
the
district
court’s
opinion,
supposing
let’s
say
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
wanted
to
fire
a
scheduled
employee,
would
any
employee
in
the
treasury
department
be
a
neutral
hearing,
possible
neutral
adjudicator
or
would
you
have
to
go
outside
the
treasury
department?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
secretary
initiated
the
charges
that
the
subordinates
of
the
secretary’s
could
hear
them?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
interpret
the
district
court’s
opinion
in
that
hypothesis?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
is
a
subordinate?
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnhill,
in
bell
and
burson,
what
we
said
was,
the
inquiry
and
default
of
liability
requisite
to
afford
the
licensee
due
process
need
not
take
the
form
of
full
adjudication
of
the
question
of
liability.
and
i
gather
you
say
here
also?
unknown
speaker
just
need
not
take
the
form
of
full
of
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
the
charge?
unknown
speaker
that
adjudication
can
only
made
in
litigation
between
the
parties
involved
in
the
act.
the
only
purpose
of
the
provision
is
to
attain
security
from
which
to
pay
any
judgments
against
the
licensee
resulting
from
the
act.
we
hold
a
procedural
due
process
will
be
satisfied
by
an
inquiry,
limited
to
the
the
determination
where
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
judgments
in
amounts
claimed,
then
i
take
it
you
say
it
here
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
a
determination
that
the
charges
are
true
that
you
are
on.
unknown
speaker
and
you
surround
that
with
a
hearing
before
an
independent
examiner?
unknown
speaker
and
a
right
to
confront
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
what
else?
unknown
speaker
that
is
statement
of
reasons?
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnhill,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
not
yet,
unless
i
missed
it,
addressed
the
government’s
basic
argument
which
is
i
understand
is
this.
in
order
for
the
demands
of
procedural
due
process
to
become
applicable,
there
has
to
be
a
depravation
of
liberty
or
property.
i
suppose
you
would
conceive
that
if
an
employment
of
an
employee
were
clearly
and
concededly
an
employment
at
will
and
it
was
understood
when
he
took
the
job
that
he
could
be
fired
on
a
moment’s
notice
for
any
reason,
however
arbitrary.
that
if
he
were
fired
at
will,
there
would
no
be
no
depravation
of
his
property,
would
that
be
correct?
if
he
has
no
expectancy.
unknown
speaker
and
the
government’s
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
property
interests
so
far
as
there
was
one
involved
in
this
government
job
was
measured
by
the
provisions
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act?
unknown
speaker
and
that
when
the
provisions
of
that
act
were
complied
with,
that
was
the
extent
of
his
property
interests
and
that
was
all
to
which
he
was
entitled.
those
were
the
metes
and
bounds
because
i
say
of
his
tenure
so
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
just
proceeded
on
the
assumption
i
think
that
this
was
a
property
interest
that
was
protected
by
some
other
provisions,
and
i
do
not
quite
think
that
you,
as
i
say,
addressed
yourself
to
what
i
understand
to
be
the
government’s
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn’t
that
have
to
be
--
7501
have
to
be
read
together
with
the
procedural
provisions
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act?
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
off
on
that.
take
roth
and
perry
which
was
decided
just
two
years,
as
i
recall,
justice
stewart
writing
for
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
your
claim,
your
property
claim
has
to
be
founded
on
some
provision
of
state
law
as
some
understanding
is
result
of
state
law
and
i
would
think
that
the
analogous
situation
here
is
that
your
claim
has
to
be
founded
on
what
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
leads
you
to
think
your
rights
are
going
to
be?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
they
are
part
of
the
same
act?
unknown
speaker
the
civil
service,
they
obviously
thought
that
the
proceddings
were
ample.
unknown
speaker
if
the
act
said
that
a
government
employee
may
not
be
fired
for
cause
as
determined
by
the
superior
writing
him
a
letter
in
that
standard,
do
you
expect
him
to
define
the
property
interest
to
that
extent?
would
you
like
to
still
argue?
unknown
speaker
but,
there
might
be
more
--
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
just
say
that
they
defined
the
property
but
it
does
not
define
the
liberty
interest
that
he
is
being
--
that
the
government’s
arbitrary
reporting
to
fire
him
by
finding
of
incompetence
or
–-
unknown
speaker
of
some
other
reason
that
will
impinge
his
right
to
be
represented?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
a
claim
that
the
discharged
violated
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
is
not
the
one
that
you
can
raise
before
the
three-judge
district
court
is
it?
don't
you
have
to
pursue
that
through
the
civil
service
commission
and
then
appeal
from
the
civil
service
commission?
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnhill?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
limits
to
the
argument
you
are
now
making
--
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
an
employee
did
charge
his
superior
falsely
with
accepting
a
bribe.
let’s
assume
further
since
you
mentioned
off
duty,
that
this
were
done
off
duty,
would
that
justify
discharge
or
would
you
consider
that
his
right
of
free
speech
would
entitle
him
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
what
you
arguing
mr.
barnhill
is
whatever
may
be
the
reach
of
a
properly
drawn
statute
to
reach
the
conduct
of
this
fellow
or
someone
in
hypothetical
mr.
justice
powell
gave
you,
following
a
gooding
analysis,
he
has
standing
because
--
unknown
speaker
--
this
reaches
more
than
that
kind
of
speech.
unknown
speaker
more
accurately,
i
guess
the
overbreadth.
unknown
speaker
more
accurately,
the
argument
based
on
overbreadth?
unknown
speaker
why
is
the
hearing
been
denied?
been
delayed,
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
he
does
say
it
that
the
court
might
have
found
it
that
conversations
for
which
he
is
being
punished
are
inaccurately
set
forth
in
the
adverse
action.
unknown
speaker
in
respect,
working
in
a
very
controversial
field
here
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker

it
was

adjudication
of
the
question
of
liability.
and
i
gather
you
say
here
also?
unknown
speaker
just
need
not
take
the
form
of
full
of
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
the
charge?
unknown
speaker
that
adjudication
can
only
made
in
litigation
between
the
parties
involved
in
the
act.
the
only
purpose
of
the
provision
is
to
attain
security
from
which
to
pay
any
judgments
against
the
licensee
resulting
from
the
act.
we
hold
a
procedural
due
process
will
be
satisfied
by
an
inquiry,
limited
to
the
the
determination
where
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
judgments
in
amounts
claimed,
then
i
take
it
you
say
it
here
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
a
determination
that
the
charges
are
true
that
you
are
on.
unknown
speaker
and
you
surround
that
with
a
hearing
before
an
independent
examiner?
unknown
speaker
and
a
right
to
confront
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
what
else?
unknown
speaker
that
is
statement
of
reasons?
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnhill,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
not
yet,
unless
i
missed
it,
addressed
the
government’s
basic
argument
which
is
i
understand
is
this.
in
order
for
the
demands
of
procedural
due
process
to
become
applicable,
there
has
to
be
a
depravation
of
liberty
or
property.
i
suppose
you
would
conceive
that
if
an
employment
of
an
employee
were
clearly
and
concededly
an
employment
at
will
and
it
was
understood
when
he
took
the
job
that
he
could
be
fired
on
a
moment’s
notice
for
any
reason,
however
arbitrary.
that
if
he
were
fired
at
will,
there
would
no
be
no
depravation
of
his
property,
would
that
be
correct?
if
he
has
no
expectancy.
unknown
speaker
and
the
government’s
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
property
interests
so
far
as
there
was
one
involved
in
this
government
job
was
measured
by
the
provisions
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act?
unknown
speaker
and
that
when
the
provisions
of
that
act
were
complied
with,
that
was
the
extent
of
his
property
interests
and
that
was
all
to
which
he
was
entitled.
those
were
the
metes
and
bounds
because
i
say
of
his
tenure
so
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
just
proceeded
on
the
assumption
i
think
that
this
was
a
property
interest
that
was
protected
by
some
other
provisions,
and
i
do
not
quite
think
that
you,
as
i
say,
addressed
yourself
to
what
i
understand
to
be
the
government’s
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn’t
that
have
to
be
--
7501
have
to
be
read
together
with
the
procedural
provisions
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act?
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
off
on
that.
take
roth
and
perry
which
was
decided
just
two
years,
as
i
recall,
justice
stewart
writing
for
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
your
claim,
your
property
claim
has
to
be
founded
on
some
provision
of
state
law
as
some
understanding
is
result
of
state
law
and
i
would
think
that
the
analogous
situation
here
is
that
your
claim
has
to
be
founded
on
what
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
leads
you
to
think
your
rights
are
going
to
be?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
they
are
part
of
the
same
act?
unknown
speaker
the
civil
service,
they
obviously
thought
that
the
proceddings
were
ample.
unknown
speaker
if
the
act
said
that
a
government
employee
may
not
be
fired
for
cause
as
determined
by
the
superior
writing
him
a
letter
in
that
standard,
do
you
expect
him
to
define
the
property
interest
to
that
extent?
would
you
like
to
still
argue?
unknown
speaker
but,
there
might
be
more
--
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
just
say
that
they
defined
the
property
but
it
does
not
define
the
liberty
interest
that
he
is
being
--
that
the
government’s
arbitrary
reporting
to
fire
him
by
finding
of
incompetence
or
–-
unknown
speaker
of
some
other
reason
that
will
impinge
his
right
to
be
represented?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
a
claim
that
the
discharged
violated
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
is
not
the
one
that
you
can
raise
before
the
three-judge
district
court
is
it?
don't
you
have
to
pursue
that
through
the
civil
service
commission
and
then
appeal
from
the
civil
service
commission?
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnhill?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
limits
to
the
argument
you
are
now
making
--
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
an
employee
did
charge
his
superior
falsely
with
accepting
a
bribe.
let’s
assume
further
since
you
mentioned
off
duty,
that
this
were
done
off
duty,
would
that
justify
discharge
or
would
you
consider
that
his
right
of
free
speech
would
entitle
him
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
what
you
arguing
mr.
barnhill
is
whatever
may
be
the
reach
of
a
properly
drawn
statute
to
reach
the
conduct
of
this
fellow
or
someone
in
hypothetical
mr.
justice
powell
gave
you,
following
a
gooding
analysis,
he
has
standing
because
--
unknown
speaker
--
this
reaches
more
than
that
kind
of
speech.
unknown
speaker
more
accurately,
i
guess
the
overbreadth.
unknown
speaker
more
accurately,
the
argument
based
on
overbreadth?
unknown
speaker
why
is
the
hearing
been
denied?
been
delayed,
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
he
does
say
it
that
the
court
might
have
found
it
that
conversations
for
which
he
is
being
punished
are
inaccurately
set
forth
in
the
adverse
action.
