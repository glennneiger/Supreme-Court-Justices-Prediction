mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
text
of
the
statute
just
set
forth
in
appendix
a
of
our
brief.
this
statute
provides
that
a
taxpayer
may
treat
research
or
experimental
expenditures
which
are
paid
or
incurred
by
him
during
the
taxable
year
in
connection
with
his
trade
or
business
as
expenses
which
are
not
chargeable
to
capital
account.
subsection
b
provides
for
an
election
to
amortize
such
expenses
over
a
period
of
time
not
less
than
16
months.
now,
this
case
focuses
upon
the
statutory
requirement
which
exists
in
both
subsection
a
and
subsection
b
that
the
expenditures
be
incurred
in
connection
with
the
taxpayer's
trade
or
businesses.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
in
our
view,
the
term
trade
or
business
has
had
a
long
and
honored
history
under
the
taxing
act
as
recognized
by
this
court
that
the
tax
law
has
long
drawn
the
distinction
between
investment
activities
or
income
producing
activities
and
that
trade
or
business
connotes
something
more
than
that.
more
than
the
hope
of
a
profit,
it
connotes
holding
oneself
out
as
selling
--
available
to
selling
goods
or
services.
now,
this
case
involves
only
1966
and
the
courts
below
i
think
properly
confined
their
attention
to
the
events
of
that
year.
now,
in
that
year,
you
had
a
situation
where
trott,
the
purported
inventor
had
this
idea
for
a
product,
he
needed
some
financing.
he
asked
several
of
his
friends
to
lend,
to
give
him
some
money
and
ultimately,
a
limited
partnership
venture
was
formed
of
the
petitioner
here
contributing
$10,000.00,
i
think
for
4%
limited
partnership
interest.
now,
the
important
thing
in
our
view
is,
what
exactly
happened
in
1966.
and
i
think
the
findings
of
that
of
the
tax
court
are
not
disputed
in
this
regard
that
what
happened
simply
was
that
a
very
crude
prototype
model
was
developed.
patent
counsel
examined
it,
looked
at
it
and
said
simply
that
it
wasn't
reduced
to
practice,
that
it
didn't
work
properly
and
that
additional
work
would
have
to
be
done
on
it.
ultimately,
the
partnership
spent
the
rest
of
its
$40,000.00
initial
capital
i
think
in
the
next
year
1967.
and
then
ultimately,
as
both
courts
below
adverted
to
more
work
had
to
be
done
on
it
that
the
device
radically
changed
and
before
the
ultimate
patent
was
applied
for
in
1969
and
received
in
1970,
the
device
became
a
very
different
device.
now,
in
our
view
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
outside
the
record.
what
seems
to
be
--
what
seems
to
what
can
be
pieced
together
essentially
is
that
the
partnership
went
out
of
existence
in
1968
or
1969.
a
corporation
was
formed
for
the
burns
investment
corporation.
that's
in
tax
court
findings
of
fact.
whether
that
corporation,
whether
the
shareholders
of
that
corporation
are
the
same
as
the
limited
partners
here,
it's
unclear
from
the
record.
i
would
just
assume,
speculate
it
probably
is
the
case
that
the
shareholders,
that
the
partners
contributed
the
partnership
assets
to
the
corporation
in
a
tax
free
exchange.
i
think
that
probably
would
happen.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
perhaps
echo
and
courier
also
went
the
same
way
as
we
had
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
essentially,
there
--
and
mr.
doan
pointed
out
that
the
service
did
not
disturb
--
petitioners
did
claim
deductions
for
174
treatment
for
the
other
--
for
the
other
partnerships
in
the
year
1965.
that's
probably
the
case
although
i
think
it's
quite
irrelevant.
it
simply
was
--
it
is
simply
an
over
side
of,
you
know.
the
service
has
to
set
priorities
for
its
audit
work.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
probably
would,
mr.
justice
powell.
i
think
from
--
i
think
that
that
flows
from
the
services
acquiescence
in
the
best
lock
company
case.
there
was
a
case
where
the
company
was
clearly
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
locks.
the
tax
court's
findings
--
the
internal
revenue
service
however
disallowed
to
claim
the
174
deductions
for
the
development
of
an
isothermal
air
compressor.
and
the
tax
court
in
its
opinion
said
simply
that
disallowance
ignored
that
corporation's
long
history
of
experimentation
and
efforts
to
develop
new
products.
i
think
once
you
have
it,
an
ongoing
trade
or
business,
i
think
it's
a
statutory
manner
you
have
a
trade
or
business
in
connection
with
which
a
research
or
experimental
expenditures
would
be
incurred.
i
think
they
would
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
apparently,
there
are
instances.
there
is
a
case
called
mayrath
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
which
involved
the
situation
of
a
man
who
developed,
who
invented
farm
implements
and
then
he
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
an
experimental
home
and
the
service
disallowed
that
deduction.
there
was
very
little
in
the
way
of
focusing
on
the
question
as
to
whether
--
he
was
clearly
an
inventor
having
invented
and
manufactured,
you
know
and
sold
farm
products
but
the
fifth
circuit
simply
said
that
this
was
an
experimental
home
in
which
he
was
living
and
then
they
will
classify
simply
as
personal
expenses.
i
think
that
the
service
probably
would
like
to
reserve
some
leeway
so
to
speak
if
the
products
are
totally
unrelated
to
each
other.
but
because
the
best
universal
lock
company
case
rested
in
part,
i
think
on
the
corporation's
long
history
of
experimentation.
but
i
think
that
it's
a
general
matter,
the
acquiescence
in
that
case,
i
think
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
you
have
an
ongoing
business,
which
was
clearly
not
the
case
here
in
1966,
that
research
or
experimental
expenditures
expended
to
develop
a
new
product
would
come
within
174
treatment.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suspect
so.
i
mean,
you
have
an
isothermal
air
compressor,
so
this
is
so
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
we
would
have
a
more
difficult
case.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
probably
would
be
the
lock
case.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
worry
about
that
here
because
i
think
under
the
court's
whipple
opinion
and
the
long
history
of
separating
corporations
from
their
employees,
i
think
that,
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
we
can
attribute
the
business
of
procter
&
gamble
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
probably,
would've
been
given
the
deduction
because
they
are
in
the
--
they
would
be
deemed
to
be
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
another
question
that
you
asked
during
mr.
doan's
argument.
and
that
is,
what
the
ultimate
effect
would
be
--
what
the
ultimate
tax
benefit
of
these
expenditures
would
be.
i
don't
think
that
it's
entirely
clear
that
they
are
lost
forever.
i
think
that
if
the
partnership
had
continued,
i
think
that
there's
certainly
an
arguable
case
for
saying
that
these
things
could
have
been
--
that
the
election
could
have
been
made
to
amortized
the
expenditures.
in
fact,
the
amortization
aspect
of
the
statute
is
exactly
designed
to
help
the
kind
of
small
pioneering
business
that
mr.
doan
has
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
that
is
true.
but
the
point
is
that
the
election
to
amortize
--
assuming
that
the
partnership
went
along
for
a
few
years
and
then
ultimately
satisfied
the
test
of
being
in
a
trade
or
business,
the
amortization
provisions
provide
that
the
election
to
amortize
begins
with
the
year
--
the
first
year
in
which
benefits
from
the
expenditure
are
derived.
so,
assuming
that
a
few
years
went
on
and
then
the
partnership
ultimately
held
these
things
out
for
sale,
i
think
that
the
partnership
would
have
a
strong
case
then
to
say,
we
elect
the
amortization
provision.
we
are
in
the
trade
or
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don't
think
he
would
go
back
--
i
don't
think
you
could
go
back
in
this
case.
it
would
depend
simply
whether
the
year
would
be
open
in
which
the
benefits
were
first
derived.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
any
--
yes
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they're
not
lost
in
that
respect.
now,
this
case
is
muddied
further
by
the
fact
that
apparently,
the
whole
thing
went
into
a
corporation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
had
done
the
same
thing?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
would
depend
very
much.
see,
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
our
view
and
we
think
this
is
really
whether
fourth
circuit
went
raw
in
the
cleveland
case.
simply
the
setting
up
of
a
partnership
and
the
execution
of
a
partnership
agreement
without
more
--
we
don't
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it's
got
a
going
soap
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
then
it
began
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
suspect
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he's
got
a
going
business
and
then
there's
a
research
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
under
the
statute,
that
is
really
the
critical
thing
that
you
need
--
you
need
a
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
suspect
--
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
suggest
that
any
kind
of
cosmetic
establishment
of
a
cosmetic
business
would
suffice
because
i
think
when
congress
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
alright.
well,
what
i
meant
by
cosmetic,
i
meant
simply
a
fa√ßade.
i
think
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
bonafide
enterprise.
i
think
when
congress
inserted
the
term
trade
or
business
here,
if
this
was
done
against
the
background
of
a
long
distinction
between
trade
or
business
and
investment
activities.
in
fact,
this
court
in
about
1940
had
held
in
the
higgins
case
that
the
management
of
one's
personal
investment
portfolio
even
if
it
required
the
hiring
of
several
people
and/or
the
leasing
of
an
office
was
not
a
trade
or
business.
and
the
expenses
in
connection
there
with
were
not
deductible.
what
congress
did
in
1942,
i
think
is
significant.
it
enacted
section
212.
it
didn't
--
which
did
not
enlarge
the
category
of
trade
or
business
expenses.
it
simply
created
a
new
category
a
non-trade
or
business
expenses.
now,
i
think
that's
really
the
key
to
this
case.
congress
could
have
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
which
is
research
expenses
did
not
qualify
for
either.
right!
because
research
expenditures
are
somewhat
different.
research
expenditures
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
54
code
were
regarded
as
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
think
it
was
intended
to
do
something
and
i
think
what
it
was
intended
to
do
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief
was
to
relieve
the
necessity
of
qualifying
under
the
ordinary
"standard"
of
section
162
because
research
and
development
expenditures
are
traditionally
the
kinds
of
things
that
relate
to
the
creation
of
income
and
the
benefits
derived
in
the
future
year.
that
is
the
traditional
kind
of
non-deductible
capital
expenditure.
taxpayers
also
had
a
problem
because
of
the
difficulty
of
determining
if
at
all
whether
such
expenditures
could
be
depreciated
because
of
the
difficulty
of
tagging
it
to
the
useful
life
of
the
particular
asset.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
and
i
think
that
that's
--
that
i
think
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right
and
could
not
qualify
for
depreciation
either.
in
fact,
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
statute
was
designed
to
cure
because
there
was
a
regulation
outstanding
for
seven
years
between
1919
and
1926.
that
came
out
under
the
depreciation
provisions
and
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
these
expenses
wouldn't
qualify
under
162.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
would
be
chargeable
as
capital.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
think
it
says
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
i'm
sorry.[laughter
attempt]
i
think
it
says
that
you
can
treat
it
if
they
incurred
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business,
you
can
treat
them
as
expenses
which
are
not
chargeable
to
capital
account.
i
think
that's
the
key.
i
think
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
take
a
class
of
capital
expenditures
and
relieve
them
of
the
necessity
of
qualifying
under
the
ordinary
standard.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
i'm
sorry.
well,
it's
a
slightly
unrelated
point.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
his
research
or
experimental
expenditures
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
under
our
view
of
the
case
that
would
be
a
problem.
there
would
be
a
problem
in
deducting
that.
i
think
that
curing
the
hypothetical
in
some
respects
might
be
if
he
had
energetically
sought
to
interest
someone
in
purchasing
or
entering
into
a
contract
with
him
to
provide
the
kinds
of
services
that
he
ultimately
hoped
to
provide
from
his
idea.
i
think
that
under
the
statute,
i
think
though
that
the
amortization
election
would
be
best
suited.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
no.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
--
i
don't
think
that
tax
deductions
would
be
immaterial.
i
think
that
would
--
what
would
be
done
i
think
that
instead
of
--
permit
me
to
indulge
in
a
moment
of
tax
advice.
i
think
what
could
be
done
in
a
situation
like
that
is
to
continue
operating
as
an
individual
for
a
while.
get
some
gross
receipts,
elect
the
amortization
provisions
and
be
able
to
write
off
those
expenses
over
the
60-month
period
which
174
(voice
overlap).
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
if
he
remains
small,
i
think
that,
you
know,
essentially
during
some
of
that
period,
it
would
help.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right
but
i
think
though
that,
you
know,
we're
faced
really
with
a
statute
that
uses
the
term
"trade
or
business"
and
uses
it
in
the
way
that
--
i
see
the
light.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
resuming
the
government's
presentation
of
the
snow
case,
i
think
the
best
way
to
describe
how
the
statute
works.
section
174
of
the
code
is
to
simply
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
are
two
types
of
capital
expenditures
that
could
occur
in
any
particular
situation.
now,
there's
the
capital
expenditure
that
is
incurred
before
one
enters
trade
or
business
and
then
capital
expenditures
which
are
incurred
after
the
commencement
of
a
trade
or
business.
now,
in
our
view,
section
174
is
only
designed
to
cover
this
second
category
of
capital
expenditures.
it
makes
them
subject
to
the
option
to
either
currently
deduct
or
to
amortize
over
five
years.
thus,
the
insertion,
in
our
view
of
the
term
"trade
or
business"
in
the
statute
requires
that
the
research
or
experimental
expenditures
be
incurred
by
an
ongoing
business
in
order
to
come
within
the
purview
of
the
section.
petitioner's
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
fact
that
congressman
referred
to
the
fact
that
small
businesses
that
the
statute
was
designed
to
benefit
small
businesses,
i
think
it
should
be
emphasized
to
the
extent
that
those
remarks
have
relevance.
the
important
thing
is
that
it
was
still
a
business
that
was
designed
to
be
benefited.
that
trade
or
business
is
a
technical
term
under
the
code.
it
appears
in
many
provisions.
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
courts
to
require
the
holding
of
one's
self
out
as
engaged
in
selling
goods
or
services.
and
if
congress
wanted
to
simply
make
all
research
or
experimental
expenditures
deductible
without
regard
to
the
context
in
which
they
were
incurred,
i
think
it
could've
easily
employ
the
standard
it
used
in
1942
when
section
212
came
into
the
code,
that
is
expenditures
incurred
in
connection
with
the
production
of
income.
the
fact
that
it
didn't
do
that
and
the
fact
that
congress
created
this
special
type
of
non-trade
or
business
expenditures
but
yet,
nevertheless
used
the
term
"trade
or
business"
in
section
174
is
to
us
dispositive
of
the
matter
in
terms
of
requiring
that
a
strict
standard
be
employed
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
the
standard
is
important
because
the
trade
or
business
test
provides
in
our
view
an
objective
criteria
with
which
to
measure,
to
separate
out,
so
to
speak,
simple,
personal
activities
that
is
someone
tinkering
in
his
basement
with
something
that
he
thinks
someday
may
amount
to
something
and
spending
money
on
that,
so
to
think.
and
someone
who
is
seriously
interested
in
developing
a
product
and
carries
it
through
to
the
point
in
which
income
and
benefits
are
derived
from
that
expenditure.
now,
i
wanted
also
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
fact
that
ibm
sets
this
up
--
in
the
ibm
example,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
--
there
is
no
quarrel
about
the
fact
that
ibm
is
an
ongoing
trade
or
business
and
is
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
and
it
is
holding
itself
out
as
engaged
in
the
selling
of
goods
or
services.
and
as
a
result
under
the
case,
under
the
commissioner's
view
of
the
statute
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
can't
--
that
the
statute
is
available
for
the
election
to
amortize
or
deduct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
well,
i
was
just
addressing
myself,
i
think
to
the
beginning
of
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
statute
would
apply
in
that
case
because
ibm
is
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
and
the
expenditures
are
incurred
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
correct.
but
the
point
to
the
matter
is
that
that
simply
is
non-volunteer.
what
we
have
here
is
no
trade
or
business
within
the
tax
year
under
scrutiny
1966.
now,
the
petitioner
focuses
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
an
alleged
difference
in
terminology
between
section
162
and
174.
he
says
that
you
have
the
phrase
"incurred
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business"
in
section
162
and
you
the
have
the
phrase
"incurred
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business"
in
section
174.
in
our
view,
the
terminology
is
equivalent.
the
committee
reports
for
section
212
used
the
phrases
interchangeably.
in
fact,
what
was
the
commissioner's
regulation
under
section
162
used
the
phrase
in
connection
with
"incurred
in
carrying
on"
interchangeably.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
difference
between
those
two
statutory
expressions.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
both
require
the
existence
of
an
ongoing
trade
or
business.
now,
the
connection
between
section
162
and
174
is
an
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
correct
because
they
would
be
regarded
as
--
they
probably
would
not
fit
within
the
ordinary.
they
would
not
meet
the
ordinary
standard
necessary
simply
regarded
as
viewed.
i
don't
think
necessary
term
--
the
word
or
term
necessary
is
involved
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
the
term
ordinary
and
the
fact
that
the
term
ordinary
was
deleted
from
section
174,
in
our
view
is
the
key
to
what
this
section
was
designed
to
do.
what
would
be
otherwise
capital
expenditures
incurred
by
an
ongoing
business
currently
deductible.
now,
the
connection
between
162
and
174
was
made
by
what
we
think
is
the
more
appropriate,
is
more
current
and
correct
rule
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
richmond
television
corporation
case
because
while
that
case
involved
a
corporation
and
involved
a
claim
deduction
for
expenditures
under
162,
the
court
nevertheless
cited
in
a
footnote
not
only
the
classic
what
we
were
going
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
we
probably
would
have
the
same
position
with
regards
to
the
rent
paid
to
the
office.
i
think
that
the
important
thing
here
is
that
there
was
within
the
meaning
of
the
test,
there
was
no
holding
oneself
out
as
engaged
in
selling
goods
or
services
because
as
a
factual
matter,
they
had
nothing
whatever
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suspect
that
they
(voice
overlap).
i
think
that
they
would
go
--
they
would
increase
in
a
partnership
context,
i
think
they
probably
would
have
to
increase
the
basis
of
each
partner's
partnership
interest
and
to
the
extent
that
they
might
be
subsequently
amortized.
at
a
later
date
they
might
be
amortized.
i
see
your
point
because
the
point
is
that
it
deals
with
rental
for
a
particular
year
but
i
think
that
it
--
essentially,
i
think
the
problem
is
the
same
problem
that
the
court
is
facing
under
consideration
in
idaho
power
(voice
overlap).
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
our
position
is
that
they're
not
because
they're
in
connection
with
--
i
think
that
the
issue
in
idaho
power
is
the
same.
you're
talking
about
depreciation
of
construction
equipment
and
they're
while
it's
in
annual
expense,
it
nevertheless
has
to
go
into
the
basis
of
the
asset
that's
ultimately
created.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
the
critical
thing
is
really
holding
oneself
out
as
engaged
in
--
if
the
product
had
gotten
to
the
point
where
they
could
offer
it
for
sale
and
make
it
enter
into
pecuniary
arrangements
with
people
who
are
willing
to
pay
for
something
that
they
had
third
parties.
i
think
then
that
they
would
be
engaged
into
trade
or
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
have
to
be
actually
--
there
has
to
be
an
ongoing
business
with
someone
pointing
out
exact
--
you
know,
selling
something
that
they
have
to
offer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
or
offering
something.
they
may
be
ultimately
unsuccessful.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
must
be
--
yes,
it
must
relate
to
the
product
which
--
i
have
one
final
point
if
i
may,
just
for
a
moment.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
petitioner
raises
the
hypothetical
of
what
might
be
considered
the
usual
type
of
investment
in
a
real
estate
venture
and
says,
well,
don't
--
isn't
it
clear
that
interest
is
deductible
during
the
construction
period
of
a
project?
and
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that,
in
section
163,
congress
provided
for
the
deduction
of
interest
without
regard
to
any
trade
or
business
nexus
or
any
production
of
income
nexus
whatever.
it's
simply
interesting
incurred
on
indebtedness
and
we
think
the
analogy
is
false
and
we
think
that
this
case
has
to
be
viewed
within
the
trade
or
business
nexus
of
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
was
--
since
the
system
is
an
annual
accounting
system,
i
think,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
this
but
i
think
probably,
yes.
simply
because
we're
talking
about
an
incurred
within,
you
know
--
within
or
during
the
taxable
year.
and
if
we're
talking
about
a
calendar
year,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
would
be
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
think
it
was
simply
a
general
dissatisfaction
with
the
fact
that
such
expenditures
were
being
disallowed
as
capital
expenditures
because
they
did
not
relate
to
production.
they
did
not
derive
any
benefit
within
the
taxable
year.
i
think
that
the
congress
simply
eliminated
the
ordinary
requirement.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
feeling
in
the
hearings.
there
were
private
people
who
testified
and
as
mr.
doan
have
pointed
out
that
the
undersecretary
of
the
treasury
testified
also.
i
don't
think
i
can
give
you
a
precise
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true
but
i
don't
--
i
didn't
find
any
suggestion
of
that
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
text
of
the
statute
just
set
forth
in
appendix
a
of
our
brief.
this
statute
provides
that
a
taxpayer
may
treat
research
or
experimental
expenditures
which
are
paid
or
incurred
by
him
during
the
taxable
year
in
connection
with
his
trade
or
business
as
expenses
which
are
not
chargeable
to
capital
account.
subsection
b
provides
for
an
election
to
amortize
such
expenses
over
a
period
of
time
not
less
than
16
months.
now,
this
case
focuses
upon
the
statutory
requirement
which
exists
in
both
subsection
a
and
subsection
b
that
the
expenditures
be
incurred
in
connection
with
the
taxpayer's
trade
or
businesses.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
in
our
view,
the
term
trade
or
business
has
had
a
long
and
honored
history
under
the
taxing
act
as
recognized
by
this
court
that
the
tax
law
has
long
drawn
the
distinction
between
investment
activities
or
income
producing
activities
and
that
trade
or
business
connotes
something
more
than
that.
more
than
the
hope
of
a
profit,
it
connotes
holding
oneself
out
as
selling
--
available
to
selling
goods
or
services.
now,
this
case
involves
only
1966
and
the
courts
below
i
think
properly
confined
their
attention
to
the
events
of
that
year.
now,
in
that
year,
you
had
a
situation
where
trott,
the
purported
inventor
had
this
idea
for
a
product,
he
needed
some
financing.
he
asked
several
of
his
friends
to
lend,
to
give
him
some
money
and
ultimately,
a
limited
partnership
venture
was
formed
of
the
petitioner
here
contributing
$10,000.00,
i
think
for
4%
limited
partnership
interest.
now,
the
important
thing
in
our
view
is,
what
exactly
happened
in
1966.
and
i
think
the
findings
of
that
of
the
tax
court
are
not
disputed
in
this
regard
that
what
happened
simply
was
that
a
very
crude
prototype
model
was
developed.
patent
counsel
examined
it,
looked
at
it
and
said
simply
that
it
wasn't
reduced
to
practice,
that
it
didn't
work
properly
and
that
additional
work
would
have
to
be
done
on
it.
ultimately,
the
partnership
spent
the
rest
of
its
$40,000.00
initial
capital
i
think
in
the
next
year
1967.
and
then
ultimately,
as
both
courts
below
adverted
to
more
work
had
to
be
done
on
it
that
the
device
radically
changed
and
before
the
ultimate
patent
was
applied
for
in
1969
and
received
in
1970,
the
device
became
a
very
different
device.
now,
in
our
view
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
outside
the
record.
what
seems
to
be
--
what
seems
to
what
can
be
pieced
together
essentially
is
that
the
partnership
went
out
of
existence
in
1968
or
1969.
a
corporation
was
formed
for
the
burns
investment
corporation.
that's
in
tax
court
findings
of
fact.
whether
that
corporation,
whether
the
shareholders
of
that
corporation
are
the
same
as
the
limited
partners
here,
it's
unclear
from
the
record.
i
would
just
assume,
speculate
it
probably
is
the
case
that
the
shareholders,
that
the
partners
contributed
the
partnership
assets
to
the
corporation
in
a
tax
free
exchange.
i
think
that
probably
would
happen.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
perhaps
echo
and
courier
also
went
the
same
way
as
we
had
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
essentially,
there
--
and
mr.
doan
pointed
out
that
the
service
did
not
disturb
--
petitioners
did
claim
deductions
for
174
treatment
for
the
other
--
for
the
other
partnerships
in
the
year
1965.
that's
probably
the
case
although
i
think
it's
quite
irrelevant.
it
simply
was
--
it
is
simply
an
over
side
of,
you
know.
the
service
has
to
set
priorities
for
its
audit
work.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
probably
would,
mr.
justice
powell.
i
think
from
--
i
think
that
that
flows
from
the
services
acquiescence
in
the
best
lock
company
case.
there
was
a
case
where
the
company
was
clearly
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
locks.
the
tax
court's
findings
--
the
internal
revenue
service
however
disallowed
to
claim
the
174
deductions
for
the
development
of
an
isothermal
air
compressor.
and
the
tax
court
in
its
opinion
said
simply
that
disallowance
ignored
that
corporation's
long
history
of
experimentation
and
efforts
to
develop
new
products.
i
think
once
you
have
it,
an
ongoing
trade
or
business,
i
think
it's
a
statutory
manner
you
have
a
trade
or
business
in
connection
with
which
a
research
or
experimental
expenditures
would
be
incurred.
i
think
they
would
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
apparently,
there
are
instances.
there
is
a
case
called
mayrath
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
which
involved
the
situation
of
a
man
who
developed,
who
invented
farm
implements
and
then
he
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
an
experimental
home
and
the
service
disallowed
that
deduction.
there
was
very
little
in
the
way
of
focusing
on
the
question
as
to
whether
--
he
was
clearly
an
inventor
having
invented
and
manufactured,
you
know
and
sold
farm
products
but
the
fifth
circuit
simply
said
that
this
was
an
experimental
home
in
which
he
was
living
and
then
they
will
classify
simply
as
personal
expenses.
i
think
that
the
service
probably
would
like
to
reserve
some
leeway
so
to
speak
if
the
products
are
totally
unrelated
to
each
other.
but
because
the
best
universal
lock
company
case
rested
in
part,
i
think
on
the
corporation's
long
history
of
experimentation.
but
i
think
that
it's
a
general
matter,
the
acquiescence
in
that
case,
i
think
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
you
have
an
ongoing
business,
which
was
clearly
not
the
case
here
in
1966,
that
research
or
experimental
expenditures
expended
to
develop
a
new
product
would
come
within
174
treatment.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suspect
so.
i
mean,
you
have
an
isothermal
air
compressor,
so
this
is
so
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
we
would
have
a
more
difficult
case.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
probably
would
be
the
lock
case.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
worry
about
that
here
because
i
think
under
the
court's
whipple
opinion
and
the
long
history
of
separating
corporations
from
their
employees,
i
think
that,
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
we
can
attribute
the
business
of
procter
&
gamble
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
probably,
would've
been
given
the
deduction
because
they
are
in
the
--
they
would
be
deemed
to
be
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
another
question
that
you
asked
during
mr.
doan's
argument.
and
that
is,
what
the
ultimate
effect
would
be
--
what
the
ultimate
tax
benefit
of
these
expenditures
would
be.
i
don't
think
that
it's
entirely
clear
that
they
are
lost
forever.
i
think
that
if
the
partnership
had
continued,
i
think
that
there's
certainly
an
arguable
case
for
saying
that
these
things
could
have
been
--
that
the
election
could
have
been
made
to
amortized
the
expenditures.
in
fact,
the
amortization
aspect
of
the
statute
is
exactly
designed
to
help
the
kind
of
small
pioneering
business
that
mr.
doan
has
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
that
is
true.
but
the
point
is
that
the
election
to
amortize
--
assuming
that
the
partnership
went
along
for
a
few
years
and
then
ultimately
satisfied
the
test
of
being
in
a
trade
or
business,
the
amortization
provisions
provide
that
the
election
to
amortize
begins
with
the
year
--
the
first
year
in
which
benefits
from
the
expenditure
are
derived.
so,
assuming
that
a
few
years
went
on
and
then
the
partnership
ultimately
held
these
things
out
for
sale,
i
think
that
the
partnership
would
have
a
strong
case
then
to
say,
we
elect
the
amortization
provision.
we
are
in
the
trade
or
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don't
think
he
would
go
back
--
i
don't
think
you
could
go
back
in
this
case.
it
would
depend
simply
whether
the
year
would
be
open
in
which
the
benefits
were
first
derived.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
any
--
yes
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they're
not
lost
in
that
respect.
now,
this
case
is
muddied
further
by
the
fact
that
apparently,
the
whole
thing
went
into
a
corporation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
had
done
the
same
thing?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
would
depend
very
much.
see,
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
our
view
and
we
think
this
is
really
whether
fourth
circuit
went
raw
in
the
cleveland
case.
simply
the
setting
up
of
a
partnership
and
the
execution
of
a
partnership
agreement
without
more
--
we
don't
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it's
got
a
going
soap
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
then
it
began
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
suspect
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he's
got
a
going
business
and
then
there's
a
research
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
under
the
statute,
that
is
really
the
critical
thing
that
you
need
--
you
need
a
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
suspect
--
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
suggest
that
any
kind
of
cosmetic
establishment
of
a
cosmetic
business
would
suffice
because
i
think
when
congress
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
alright.
well,
what
i
meant
by
cosmetic,
i
meant
simply
a
fa√ßade.
i
think
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
bonafide
enterprise.
i
think
when
congress
inserted
the
term
trade
or
business
here,
if
this
was
done
against
the
background
of
a
long
distinction
between
trade
or
business
and
investment
activities.
in
fact,
this
court
in
about
1940
had
held
in
the
higgins
case
that
the
management
of
one's
personal
investment
portfolio
even
if
it
required
the
hiring
of
several
people
and/or
the
leasing
of
an
office
was
not
a
trade
or
business.
and
the
expenses
in
connection
there
with
were
not
deductible.
what
congress
did
in
1942,
i
think
is
significant.
it
enacted
section
212.
it
didn't
--
which
did
not
enlarge
the
category
of
trade
or
business
expenses.
it
simply
created
a
new
category
a
non-trade
or
business
expenses.
now,
i
think
that's
really
the
key
to
this
case.
congress
could
have
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
which
is
research
expenses
did
not
qualify
for
either.
right!
because
research
expenditures
are
somewhat
different.
research
expenditures
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
54
code
were
regarded
as
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
think
it
was
intended
to
do
something
and
i
think
what
it
was
intended
to
do
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief
was
to
relieve
the
necessity
of
qualifying
under
the
ordinary
"standard"
of
section
162
because
research
and
development
expenditures
are
traditionally
the
kinds
of
things
that
relate
to
the
creation
of
income
and
the
benefits
derived
in
the
future
year.
that
is
the
traditional
kind
of
non-deductible
capital
expenditure.
taxpayers
also
had
a
problem
because
of
the
difficulty
of
determining
if
at
all
whether
such
expenditures
could
be
depreciated
because
of
the
difficulty
of
tagging
it
to
the
useful
life
of
the
particular
asset.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
and
i
think
that
that's
--
that
i
think
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right
and
could
not
qualify
for
depreciation
either.
in
fact,
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
statute
was
designed
to
cure
because
there
was
a
regulation
outstanding
for
seven
years
between
1919
and
1926.
that
came
out
under
the
depreciation
provisions
and
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
these
expenses
wouldn't
qualify
under
162.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
would
be
chargeable
as
capital.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
think
it
says
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
i'm
sorry.[laughter
attempt]
i
think
it
says
that
you
can
treat
it
if
they
incurred
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business,
you
can
treat
them
as
expenses
which
are
not
chargeable
to
capital
account.
i
think
that's
the
key.
i
think
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
take
a
class
of
capital
expenditures
and
relieve
them
of
the
necessity
of
qualifying
under
the
ordinary
standard.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
i'm
sorry.
well,
it's
a
slightly
unrelated
point.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
his
research
or
experimental
expenditures
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
under
our
view
of
the
case
that
would
be
a
problem.
there
would
be
a
problem
in
deducting
that.
i
think
that
curing
the
hypothetical
in
some
respects
might
be
if
he
had
energetically
sought
to
interest
someone
in
purchasing
or
entering
into
a
contract
with
him
to
provide
the
kinds
of
services
that
he
ultimately
hoped
to
provide
from
his
idea.
i
think
that
under
the
statute,
i
think
though
that
the
amortization
election
would
be
best
suited.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
no.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
--
i
don't
think
that
tax
deductions
would
be
immaterial.
i
think
that
would
--
what
would
be
done
i
think
that
instead
of
--
permit
me
to
indulge
in
a
moment
of
tax
advice.
i
think
what
could
be
done
in
a
situation
like
that
is
to
continue
operating
as
an
individual
for
a
while.
get
some
gross
receipts,
elect
the
amortization
provisions
and
be
able
to
write
off
those
expenses
over
the
60-month
period
which
174
(voice
overlap).
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
if
he
remains
small,
i
think
that,
you
know,
essentially
during
some
of
that
period,
it
would
help.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right
but
i
think
though
that,
you
know,
we're
faced
really
with
a
statute
that
uses
the
term
"trade
or
business"
and
uses
it
in
the
way
that
--
i
see
the
light.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
resuming
the
government's
presentation
of
the
snow
case,
i
think
the
best
way
to
describe
how
the
statute
works.
section
174
of
the
code
is
to
simply
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
are
two
types
of
capital
expenditures
that
could
occur
in
any
particular
situation.
now,
there's
the
capital
expenditure
that
is
incurred
before
one
enters
trade
or
business
and
then
capital
expenditures
which
are
incurred
after
the
commencement
of
a
trade
or
business.
now,
in
our
view,
section
174
is
only
designed
to
cover
this
second
category
of
capital
expenditures.
it
makes
them
subject
to
the
option
to
either
currently
deduct
or
to
amortize
over
five
years.
thus,
the
insertion,
in
our
view
of
the
term
"trade
or
business"
in
the
statute
requires
that
the
research
or
experimental
expenditures
be
incurred
by
an
ongoing
business
in
order
to
come
within
the
purview
of
the
section.
petitioner's
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
fact
that
congressman
referred
to
the
fact
that
small
businesses
that
the
statute
was
designed
to
benefit
small
businesses,
i
think
it
should
be
emphasized
to
the
extent
that
those
remarks
have
relevance.
the
important
thing
is
that
it
was
still
a
business
that
was
designed
to
be
benefited.
that
trade
or
business
is
a
technical
term
under
the
code.
it
appears
in
many
provisions.
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
courts
to
require
the
holding
of
one's
self
out
as
engaged
in
selling
goods
or
services.
and
if
congress
wanted
to
simply
make
all
research
or
experimental
expenditures
deductible
without
regard
to
the
context
in
which
they
were
incurred,
i
think
it
could've
easily
employ
the
standard
it
used
in
1942
when
section
212
came
into
the
code,
that
is
expenditures
incurred
in
connection
with
the
production
of
income.
the
fact
that
it
didn't
do
that
and
the
fact
that
congress
created
this
special
type
of
non-trade
or
business
expenditures
but
yet,
nevertheless
used
the
term
"trade
or
business"
in
section
174
is
to
us
dispositive
of
the
matter
in
terms
of
requiring
that
a
strict
standard
be
employed
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
the
standard
is
important
because
the
trade
or
business
test
provides
in
our
view
an
objective
criteria
with
which
to
measure,
to
separate
out,
so
to
speak,
simple,
personal
activities
that
is
someone
tinkering
in
his
basement
with
something
that
he
thinks
someday
may
amount
to
something
and
spending
money
on
that,
so
to
think.
and
someone
who
is
seriously
interested
in
developing
a
product
and
carries
it
through
to
the
point
in
which
income
and
benefits
are
derived
from
that
expenditure.
now,
i
wanted
also
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
fact
that
ibm
sets
this
up
--
in
the
ibm
example,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
--
there
is
no
quarrel
about
the
fact
that
ibm
is
an
ongoing
trade
or
business
and
is
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
and
it
is
holding
itself
out
as
engaged
in
the
selling
of
goods
or
services.
and
as
a
result
under
the
case,
under
the
commissioner's
view
of
the
statute
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
can't
--
that
the
statute
is
available
for
the
election
to
amortize
or
deduct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
well,
i
was
just
addressing
myself,
i
think
to
the
beginning
of
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
statute
would
apply
in
that
case
because
ibm
is
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
and
the
expenditures
are
incurred
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
correct.
but
the
point
to
the
matter
is
that
that
simply
is
non-volunteer.
what
we
have
here
is
no
trade
or
business
within
the
tax
year
under
scrutiny
1966.
now,
the
petitioner
focuses
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
an
alleged
difference
in
terminology
between
section
162
and
174.
he
says
that
you
have
the
phrase
"incurred
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business"
in
section
162
and
you
the
have
the
phrase
"incurred
in
connection
with
the
trade
or
business"
in
section
174.
in
our
view,
the
terminology
is
equivalent.
the
committee
reports
for
section
212
used
the
phrases
interchangeably.
in
fact,
what
was
the
commissioner's
regulation
under
section
162
used
the
phrase
in
connection
with
"incurred
in
carrying
on"
interchangeably.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
difference
between
those
two
statutory
expressions.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
both
require
the
existence
of
an
ongoing
trade
or
business.
now,
the
connection
between
section
162
and
174
is
an
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
correct
because
they
would
be
regarded
as
--
they
probably
would
not
fit
within
the
ordinary.
they
would
not
meet
the
ordinary
standard
necessary
simply
regarded
as
viewed.
i
don't
think
necessary
term
--
the
word
or
term
necessary
is
involved
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
the
term
ordinary
and
the
fact
that
the
term
ordinary
was
deleted
from
section
174,
in
our
view
is
the
key
to
what
this
section
was
designed
to
do.
what
would
be
otherwise
capital
expenditures
incurred
by
an
ongoing
business
currently
deductible.
now,
the
connection
between
162
and
174
was
made
by
what
we
think
is
the
more
appropriate,
is
more
current
and
correct
rule
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
richmond
television
corporation
case
because
while
that
case
involved
a
corporation
and
involved
a
claim
deduction
for
expenditures
under
162,
the
court
nevertheless
cited
in
a
footnote
not
only
the
classic
what
we
were
going
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
we
probably
would
have
the
same
position
with
regards
to
the
rent
paid
to
the
office.
i
think
that
the
important
thing
here
is
that
there
was
within
the
meaning
of
the
test,
there
was
no
holding
oneself
out
as
engaged
in
selling
goods
or
services
because
as
a
factual
matter,
they
had
nothing
whatever
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suspect
that
they
(voice
overlap).
i
think
that
they
would
go
--
they
would
increase
in
a
partnership
context,
i
think
they
probably
would
have
to
increase
the
basis
of
each
partner's
partnership
interest
and
to
the
extent
that
they
might
be
subsequently
amortized.
at
a
later
date
they
might
be
amortized.
i
see
your
point
because
the
point
is
that
it
deals
with
rental
for
a
particular
year
but
i
think
that
it
--
essentially,
i
think
the
problem
is
the
same
problem
that
the
court
is
facing
under
consideration
in
idaho
power
(voice
overlap).
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
our
position
is
that
they're
not
because
they're
in
connection
with
--
i
think
that
the
issue
in
idaho
power
is
the
same.
you're
talking
about
depreciation
of
construction
equipment
and
they're
while
it's
in
annual
expense,
it
nevertheless
has
to
go
into
the
basis
of
the
asset
that's
ultimately
created.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
the
critical
thing
is
really
holding
oneself
out
as
engaged
in
--
if
the
product
had
gotten
to
the
point
where
they
could
offer
it
for
sale
and
make
it
enter
into
pecuniary
arrangements
with
people
who
are
willing
to
pay
for
something
that
they
had
third
parties.
i
think
then
that
they
would
be
engaged
into
trade
or
business.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
have
to
be
actually
--
there
has
to
be
an
ongoing
business
with
someone
pointing
out
exact
--
you
know,
selling
something
that
they
have
to
offer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
or
offering
something.
they
may
be
ultimately
unsuccessful.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
must
be
--
yes,
it
must
relate
to
the
product
which
--
i
have
one
final
point
if
i
may,
just
for
a
moment.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
petitioner
raises
the
hypothetical
of
what
might
be
considered
the
usual
type
of
investment
in
a
real
estate
venture
and
says,
well,
don't
--
isn't
it
clear
that
interest
is
deductible
during
the
construction
period
of
a
project?
and
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that,
in
section
163,
congress
provided
for
the
deduction
of
interest
without
regard
to
any
trade
or
business
nexus
or
any
production
of
income
nexus
whatever.
it's
simply
interesting
incurred
on
indebtedness
and
we
think
the
analogy
is
false
and
we
think
that
this
case
has
to
be
viewed
within
the
trade
or
business
nexus
of
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
was
--
since
the
system
is
an
annual
accounting
system,
i
think,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
this
but
i
think
probably,
yes.
simply
because
we're
talking
about
an
incurred
within,
you
know
--
within
or
during
the
taxable
year.
and
if
we're
talking
about
a
calendar
year,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
would
be
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
think
it
was
simply
a
general
dissatisfaction
with
the
fact
that
such
expenditures
were
being
disallowed
as
capital
expenditures
because
they
did
not
relate
to
production.
they
did
not
derive
any
benefit
within
the
taxable
year.
i
think
that
the
congress
simply
eliminated
the
ordinary
requirement.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
feeling
in
the
hearings.
there
were
private
people
who
testified
and
as
mr.
doan
have
pointed
out
that
the
undersecretary
of
the
treasury
testified
also.
i
don't
think
i
can
give
you
a
precise
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true
but
i
don't
--
i
didn't
find
any
suggestion
of
that
in
the
legislative
history.
