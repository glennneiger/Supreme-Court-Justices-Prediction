justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
smith,
you
state
that
the
government
position
is
that
there
must
be
an
ongoing
trade
or
business.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
burns
did
have
an
ongoing
business
in
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
some
other
product
and
that
at
the
same
time,
this
inventor
tried
to
commence
work
on
the
incinerator.
would
that
partnership
have
been
entitled
under
your
position
here
today,
to
deduct
the
expenses
of
that
work?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
it
make
any
difference
at
all
if
the
incinerator
works
totally
dissimilar
to
the
other
product
than
being
manufactured?
