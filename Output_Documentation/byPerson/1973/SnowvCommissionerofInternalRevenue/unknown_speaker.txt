unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
there's
no
dispute
about
the
integrity
of
these
expenses?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
you
also
concede
that
--
were
you
relegated
to
162,
your
case
would
not
be
a
good
one?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
you're
still
going
into
a
trade
or
business
category,
you
have
to
satisfy
that,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
how
many
times
does
this
court
concern
itself
with
the
174?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
first
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
doan,
if
this
had
been
done
by
ibm
or
3m,
do
you
think
this
service
would
have
allowed
the
deduction?
unknown
speaker
mr.
doan,
if
you
lose
this
case,
does
mr.
snow
ever
get
any
tax
benefit
for
this?
is
he
allowed
in
some
way
to
amortize
or
--
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
problem
here
if
there
had
been
a
patent
issued
and
had
been
available
for
licensing.
unknown
speaker
for
sale.
unknown
speaker
or
for
licensing,
a
patent
for
licensing.
unknown
speaker
there
might
be
expenditures
after
that
time
that
would
be
deductible
then.
unknown
speaker
not
prior.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
specifying
requirements
--
unknown
speaker
and
transferred
what
this
has
satisfied
with
the
requirements
of
the
county
regulations
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
heard
if
they
are
anymore
unrelated
than
in
the
lock
case?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
soap
manufacturer,
constantly,
this
one
connect
to
the
procter
&
gamble,
one,
they're
constantly
in
research
and
development
in
various
soap
products
and
detergents,
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff.
suppose
they
had
taken
on
the
development
of
this
incinerator.
unknown
speaker
would
that
not
be
a
lock?
unknown
speaker
but
going
back
to
my
question
to
your
opposing
counsel
about
3m
or
ibm
having
done
precisely
this
which
i
take
it
in
mr.
brennan's
question,
do
i
detect
from
your
answers
that
probably,
they
would've
been
given
a
deduction?
unknown
speaker
that
is
triggered
also
by
bringing
the
trade
or
business.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
that
in
any
event,
they
would
be
considered
taxable
expenditures?
unknown
speaker
so,
they're
not
lost
in
that?
unknown
speaker
--
research,
the
expenditures
didn't
qualify
for
either.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
174
was
intended
to
do
something
for
research
and
development
expenditures
that
212
and
162
was
implementing.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
174
as
read
means
that
you
may
deduct
those
expenses
which
absent
174
would've
been
chargeable
to
capital?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
put
it
the
other
way.
all
expenses
that
under
162
would
be
all
research
expenses
that
under
162
would
be
chargeable
and
capital
are
not
deductible.
unknown
speaker
i'm
--
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
these
expenses
wouldn't
qualify
under
162?
unknown
speaker
and
they
would
be
chargeable
as
capital?
unknown
speaker
well,
174
says
that
they're
chargeable
of
capital
under
162,
they're
deductible
here.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
asked
you
and
you
said
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
ibm
couldn't
deduct
these
research
expenditures
under
162,
could
it,
if
it
did
what
snow
did
here?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
this
thing
before
i
forget
it.
assume
that
snow
here
admitted
an
office
and
got
a
telephone
and
hired
a
secretary.
they
were
really
--
they
needed
the
correspondence
and
whatnot,
i
take
it
that
you
would
have
the
same
decision
with
respect
to
the
rent
paid
for
the
office?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
to
the
expenses
paid
out
for
the
rent
of
the
office?
they
aren't
just
capitalized
yearly.
unknown
speaker
are
there
losses?
unknown
speaker
if
they
were
deductible
at
all
under
162,
you'd
be
in
great
trouble
here,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
saying
that
there
has
to
be
--
they
have
to
be
trading
with
somebody
or
actually
doing
business
with
somebody.
unknown
speaker
or
offering
to
them.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i
hold
you
for
a
moment
but
i
have
to
quick
ones.
suppose
that
in
--
on
december
1
and
we're
on
the
calendar
you're
based,
mr.
snow
did
get
in
to
a
trade
or
business
within
the
services
concept,
would
you
permit
the
deduction
of
research
and
development
expense
incurred
in
the
preceding
10
years,
10
months
or
that
calendar
year?
unknown
speaker
and
secondly,
i
admittedly
haven't
gotten
into
the
legislative
history
but
what
brought
about
174?
was
this
brought
into
the
code
at
the
behest
of
a
service
or
was
it
--
as
it
were
imposed
on
the
service
by
some
group
of
taxpayers
who
are
able
to
persuade
the
congress
to
put
it
in?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
but
many
times,
these
things
are
imposed
upon
the
service?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
there's
no
dispute
about
the
integrity
of
these
expenses?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
you
also
concede
that
--
