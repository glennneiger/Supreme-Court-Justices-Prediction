e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
73-641,
snow
against
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
doan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
year
was
the
prototype
built?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
the
work
start
on
the
prototype?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
suppose
on
the
standpoint
of
a
small-pioneering,
i
think
you
called
it
business,
that
kind
of
deferred
tax
benefit
isn't
very
useful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
become
one
of
those
three,
they
don't
need
that
very
much,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
doan.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
mean
--
is
your
view
of
that
that
the
trade
or
business
will
must
already
be
an
ongoing
business?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
smith,
--
go
ahead,
finish.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
ask
you
something
else.
i'd
like
to
get
to
a
homely
hypothetical
stuff
like
ibm
or
xerox
or
3m.
there
was
a
man
that
has
a
conception
of
how
to
handle,
how
to
raise
chickens
and
a
new
way
to
develop
an
incubator
and
so
he
puts
whatever
he's
doing,
teaching
the
physics
department
in
the
university
or
whatnot.
eyes
himself
a
piece
of
land
in
a
house
and
then
begins
to
build
this
new
kind
of
gages
in
a
private
research
and
development
and
develops
a
bunch
of
sheds
and
barns
with
the
incubators.
finally
satisfied
that
it
could
probably
work
and
buys
himself
a
couple
of
thousand
of
eggs
but
he's
in
that
business.
he
can't
afford
a
telephone.
he
can't
afford
employees.
he
and
his
wife
and
his
son
do
all
these.
now,
that
he
reaches
a
point
where
it's
feasible.
he
organizes
a
corporation
that
carried
on
for
the
future.
under
the
framework
of
the
government's
view
of
this
case,
would
this
year
or
work
done
in
this
taxable
year
on
the
development
of
these
incubators,
the
sheds,
all
the
things
i
have
described
and
a
lot
that
you
can
imagine
filling
in,
deductible
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
remind
you
he
hasn't
sold
--
he's
only
bought
eggs
to
turn
into
chickens.
he
hasn't
sold
the
chicken.
he
hasn't
advertised,
hasn't
done
anything.
he
gets
into
business
the
next
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
meant
that
when
he
--
if
the
business
were
a
great
success,
he
might
get
it
when
it
was
immaterial
to
him
and
if
it
was
a
failure,
it
would
be
academic,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
small
businessman
of
the
kind,
i
take
it
was
congressman
reed
was
talking
about.
it
appears
to
be
congressman
reed's
statement,
wouldn't
be
helped
much
by
an
amortization
extended
over
five
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
the
usual
history
of
small
businesses
getting
started
like
this
that
they
put
themselves
completely
in
track
as
it
were
to
get
started?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
right
after
lunch,
mr.
smith.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
answer
justice
white's
hypothetical
and
other
but
non-recurring
item
of
expense.
suppose
they
call
a
professional
employment
agency
and
said,
'here
is
the
staff
we
think
we'll
need.
we'll
need
x
number
of
executives
and
some
of
the
stenographers
and
a
shop
foreman
and
a
whole
list
and
engage
them
on
a
professional
basis
for
hire.
now,
have
they
got
into
business
yet?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
along
with
the
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
must
relate
to
the
product
which
is
ultimately
to
be
distributed,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
briefly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
four
minutes
now.
chief
justice

e.

that
section
again,
mr.

chief
justice

e.

you

the
case
is
submitted.
