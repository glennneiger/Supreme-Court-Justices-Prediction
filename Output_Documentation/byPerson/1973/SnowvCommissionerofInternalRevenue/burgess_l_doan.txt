mr.
burgess
l.
doan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
deficiency
in
federal
income
tax
for
the
taxable
year
1966.
the
issue
is
whether
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
his
distributive
share
of
a
net
operating
loss
resulting
from
research
and
experimental
expenditures
incurred
and
paid
by
burns,
a
partnership
during
the
taxable
year
1966.
petitioner
contends
he
is
entitled
to
deduct
his
distributive
share
of
the
net
operating
loss
of
burns
since
the
expenses
giving
rise
to
this
loss
were
incurred
and
paid
during
the
taxable
year
1966
as
research
and
experimental
expenses.
these
expenses
are
covered
by
section
174
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
has
disallowed
these
expenses
upon
audit
of
the
partnership
return
on
the
grounds
that
neither
burns
investment
company
nor
the
petitioner
snow
was
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business.
the
united
states
tax
court
sustained
the
commissioner
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
sustained
the
tax
court's
decision
holding
that
the
expenditures
sought
to
be
deducted
by
burns
investment
company
in
1966
were
pre-operating
expenses
and
not
deductible
under
section
174.
the
facts
of
the
case
were
fairly
simple.
in
1963,
mr.
trott
who
was
the
inventor
of
a
trash-burning
device
and
who
was
also
the
managing
partner
of
burns
investment
company
resigned
from
his
position
with
the
procter
&
gamble
company
and
purchased
an
interest
in
a
small,
closely-held
corporation
doing
business
as
crossbow.
in
addition
to
his
activity
in
crossbow,
mr.
trott
carried
on
research
and
development
work
on
three
different
items:
number
one,
a
telephone
answering
device;
number
two,
a
tape
recorder;
and
number
three,
the
item
at
issue,
a
trash
burner
or
a
leaf
burner.
upon
audit
of
the
partnership
return,
the
internal
revenue
service
held
that
mr.
trott,
the
general
partner
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
an
inventor
by
virtue
of
his
activities
in
these
various
projects.
the
partnerships
which
were
three,
which
were
formed
to
carry
on
these
various
ventures,
were
doing
business
as
echo
development
company
and
that
partnership
was
formed
in
march
of
1965.
the
second
partnership
doing
business
as
courier
enterprises
was
formed
to
carry
on
the
development
of
the
tape
recorder
and
that
partnership
was
also
formed
in
march
of
1965.
the
partnership,
burns
investment
company
which
was
formed
to
carry
on
the
development
of
the
trash
burner
was
formed
in
1966.
all
three
partnerships
was
formed
for
the
same
purpose,
and
that
was
the
development,
securing
patents
on
and
finally
either
producing
or
licensing
another
manufacture
to
produce
these
various
items.
during
1966,
echo
and
courier
--
1966
is
the
year
at
issue
and
during
1966,
echo
and
courier
had
completed
products
--
that
is
the
tape
recorder,
and
the
telephone
answering
device
which
was
then
held
available
for
sale
or
licensing.
patents
had
been
applied
for,
in
the
case
of
the
telephone
answering
device
as
of
august
the
16th,
1966.
patents
had
been
applied
for,
in
the
case
of
the
tape
recorder
as
of
november
22,
1967.
patents
for
the
trash
burner
was
applied
for
as
of
june
10,
1968
and
in
each
instance,
patents
were
granted.
and
in
the
case
of
the
trash
burner,
foreign
patents
have
been
granted
in
at
least
14
foreign
countries.
the
internal
revenue
service
held
that
burns
investment
company
was
not
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
during
the
taxable
year
1966.
the
internal
revenue
service
did
not
see
fit
to
disturb
the
status
of
echo
or
courier,
the
two
remaining
partnerships.
mr.
trott,
the
inventor
and
the
managing
partner,
testified
that
he
worked
on
the
development
of
the
trash
burner
during
the
years
1964
and
1965,
and
during
that
time,
he
devoted
at
least
one-third
of
his
time
to
that
venture.
on
december
10th
1965,
the
development
of
the
trash
burner
had
advanced
to
the
stage
that
mr.
trott
had
received
an
opinion
from
patent
counsel,
stating
that
"features
of
the
trash
burner
were
then
patentable"
in
his
opinion.
however,
he
advised
against
filing
an
application
for
a
patent
in
december
of
1965
suggesting
that
the
filing
be
held
up
until
a
prototype
had
been
built.
the
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
many
prototypes
had
been
built
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
the
prototype,
to
which
we
allude
as
existing
in
1965,
was
a
rather
crude
prototype
model
that
admittedly
did
have
some
flaws
in
it.
it
did
not
work
well.
the
second
letter
which
was
received
from
patent
counsel
in
february
of
1966,
pointed
out
that
the
prototype
that
was
then
in
existence
needed
further
modification,
again
in
the
opinion
of
patent
counsel.
after
receiving
the
letter
from
patent
counsel
advising
of
that
fact
in
1966,
mr.
trott
proceeded
to
form
the
partnership
burns
investment
company
to
raise
capital
to
further
develop
the
trash
burner.
after
forming
the
partnership,
articles
of
partnership
were
drawn
up
and
filed
with
the
hamilton
county
reporter's
office.
the
partners
paid
in
their
capital
contributions
to
the
extent
of
$40,000.00.
the
partnership
proceeded
to
secure
its
federal
employer
identification
number.
it
proceeded
to
establish
its
bank
accounts.
it
set
up
its
books
and
records.
it
filed
its
federal
income
tax
return.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor,
the
office
of
burns
investment
company
was
in
the
facilities
of
the
closely-held
corporation,
crossbow.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
the
business
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
that
business
was
located
within
the
same
building
as
crossbow.
it
did
not
have
a
name
on
the
door
and
it
did
not
have
a
telephone.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
one
was
a
partnership
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
it
did
not
have
any
employees
directly.
mr.
trott
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
mr.
trott
was
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes
your
honor,
we
have
to
show
we
have
a
partnership
business.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor,
we
submit
that
his
business
is
the
research
and
the
experimental
activity
carried
on
in
perfecting
the
trash
burner.
the
partnership
burns
investment
company
did
enter
into
a
contractual
relationship
with
crossbow
and
with
other
suppliers
obligating
itself
for
goods
and
services.
it
conducted
regular
partnership
meetings
regarding
the
development
work,
regarding
tests
and
experiments
that
were
carried
on,
regarding
the
design
of
the
trash
burner,
regarding
the
various
marketing
methods
on
how
the
trash
burner
could
best
be
brought
to
the
commercial
market.
the
partnership
burns
did
not
have
a
trash
burner
that
was
then
available
for
sale
to
the
market
in
1966.
section
174
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
that
a
taxpayer
may
deduct
research
and
experimental
expenditures
paid
or
incurred
by
him
during
the
taxable
year
in
connection
with
his
trade
or
business.
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
these
expenses
involved
in
this
case
being
a
research
and
experimental
expenses
within
the
meaning
of
section
174.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
no,
your
honor.
there
is
not.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
we
admit
to
that,
your
honor.
the
term
trade
or
business
is
nowhere
defined
in
section
174
or
in
the
commissioner's
regulations
under
section
174.
the
respondent
contends
in
this
case
that
the
term
trade
or
business
has
the
same
meaning
in
section
174
as
it
has
in
other
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
however,
the
case
law
relied
upon
in
support
of
this
proposition
in
every
instance
goes
back
to
a
section
162
standard.
and
162
allows
expenses
incurred
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business.
section
162
has
other
standards
as
well.
specifically,
section
162
provides
that
a
taxpayer
may
deduct
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business
while
section
174
has
a
different
standard.
section
174
says
that
the
taxpayer
may
deduct
research
and
experimental
expenditures
incurred
or
paid
during
the
taxable
year
in
connection
with
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
to
satisfy
the
standard
trade
or
business.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
never,
your
honor
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
the
basis
of
the
respondent's
contention
in
this
case
goes
back
to
an
early
decision
written
by
this
court
where
the
theory
was
advanced
that
before
a
taxpayer
could
be
said
to
be
sharing
on
a
trade
or
business,
he
must
be
holding
himself
out
as
offering
for
sale
goods
or
services.
we
submit
that
that
standard
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
section
174
which
was
not
written
until
1954.
we
believe
that
this
is
borne
out
by
the
legislative
history
found
in
the
committee
reports
in
connection
with
the
development
of
section
174.
we
believe
that
section
174
was
intended
to
be
a
liberalizing
provision
to
allow
these
expenditures
which
otherwise
would
have
to
be
capitalized
to
be
deductible
in
the
year
incurred.
the
legislative
history
of
174
indicates
a
broad
purpose
to
provide
an
economic
incentive
especially
for
small
and
growing
businesses
to
engage
in
the
research
for
new
products
and
new
inventions.
the
measure
was
initially
introduced
in
the
congress
in
1951
and
the
purpose
for
its
introduction
was
to
clarify
the
existing
confusion
in
respect
to
tax
treatment
of
such
expenditures
and
to
prevent
tax
discriminations
between
large,
existing,
well-established
businesses
and
their
small
beginning
counterparts.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
the
best
illustration
of
that
is
best
universal
lock
company.
the
case
decided
in
1966
by
the
tax
court.
best
universal
lock
company
involved
a
corporation,
a
successful
large
corporation
based
in
the
state
of
indiana
which
had
historically
been
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
locks.
during
the
1960's,
best
lock
company
decided
to
develop
a
new
line
of
business
and
it
as
a
result,
commenced
a
research
program
on
isothermal
air
compressors
which
was
admittedly
a
completely
unrelated
line
of
business.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
disallowed
it
saying
that
research
and
development
expenses
claimed
in
this
connection
were
not
deductible.
however,
the
tax
court
reversed
or
did
not
hold
for
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
in
that
case
and
said
that
these
businesses
were
sufficiently
or
these
expenditures
were
sufficiently
connected
with
an
ongoing
business
and
therefore
deductible.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
has
acquiest
in
that
decision
and
in
1973,
the
commissioner
has
issued
a
revenue
ruling
directing
the
employees
at
the
audit
level
and
on
up
through
the
ranks
of
the
internal
revenue
service
that
this
decision
will
be
valid.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor
and
there
lies
the
discrimination
against
my
client.
the
remarks
of
mr.
reed
who
was
then
chairman
of
the
house
committee
on
ways
and
means
in
the
hearings
on
hr
8300,
the
bill
which
embodied
what
was
to
become
the
revenue
code
of
1954,
i
believe
makes
this
point
very
clear.
he
stated
and
i
quote,
"the
present
law
contains
no
statutory
provisions
dealing
with
the
deduction
of
these
expenses".
the
result
has
been
confusion
and
uncertainty.
very
often
under
present
law,
small
businesses
which
are
developing
new
products
and
do
not
have
established
research
departments
are
not
allowed
to
deduct
their
expenses
despite
the
fact
that
the
large,
well-established
competitors
can
obtain
the
deduction.
this
provision
will
greatly
stimulate
the
search
for
new
products
and
new
inventions
upon
which
the
future
economic
and
military
strength
of
a
nation
depends.
it
will
be
particularly
valuable
to
small
and
growing
businesses.
throughout
the
committee
reports,
the
term
pops
up
small
and
growing
businesses.
the
undersecretary
of
the
treasury
when
he
appeared
before
that
ways
and
means
committee
testifying
as
to
the
present
treatment
of
these
expenses
used
the
same
analogy
except
that
he
used
the
term
that
this
will
help
small
pioneering
businesses.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor,
if
a
taxpayer
cannot
utilize
section
174,
and
the
expenses
are
held
to
be
in
the
category
of
pre-operating
expenses
or
investigatory-type
expenses,
there
is
no
provision
for
any
relief
for
tax
purposes
except
when
the
venture
may
be
abandoned
or
when
it
might
be
sold.
that
is
the
venture
itself
not
an
item
within
the
venture.
there's
no
provision
for
these
expenditures
being
capitalized
and
amortized
over
the
useful
life
because
it
is
and
has
been
the
position
of
the
treasury
that
you
cannot
determine
a
useful
life
and
therefore
they
are
not
subject
to
depreciation
or
amortization.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
especially
if
this
is
a
genuine
and
bona
fide
business
venture
where
the
people
are
in
there
trying.
they
put
it
together
and
it
does
become
an
ongoing
business.
it
grows
up
and
it
becomes
a
polaroid,
a
xerox,
and
ibm.
that
capital
contribution
would
be
locked
in
for
any
period
of
time.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
no,
your
honor.
hopefully,
it
will.
we
believe
however,
the
clear
congressional
intent,
is
that
a
small
business
like
burns
whose
entire
energies
are
devoted
to
a
product
development
effort
would
seem
to
be
precisely
the
kind
of
taxpayer
that
congress
sought
to
bring
within
the
reach
of
section
174.
the
decision
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
snow
however
makes
that
section
unavailable
to
burns
while
preserving
it
to
large
and
well-established
competitors.
the
by-product
of
that
decision,
in
my
opinion,
will
foster
monopoly.
it
will
stifle
research
and
development
activity.
it
will
continue
the
discrimination
against
small
businesses
that
section
174
was
designed
to
eliminate.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
the
decisions
are
not
clear,
your
honor.
the
test
that
respondent
has
suggested
would
require
holding
a
product
or
a
service
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
for
sale.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
not
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
that
is
the
contention
of
the
respondent,
your
honor.
however,
we
feel
that
section
--
that
is
a
section
162
standard
but
that's
only
part
of
it.
section
162
says,
ordinary
and
necessary
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business.
there
are
three
elements
involved
in
section
162,
the
total
standard.
now,
in
section
174,
congress
did
not
choose
to
include
any
of
those.
respondent
suggests
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
the
two
you
mentioned,
your
honor,
"ordinary
and
necessary".
however,
i
contend
that
the
carrying
on
standard
was
also
eliminated.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
we,
of
course,
rely
heavily
on
cleveland
versus
commissioner
which
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondent
on
the
other
hand,
relies
on
a
later
fourth
circuit
decision,
richmond
television.
cleveland
versus
commissioner
was
a
section
174
case,
a
section
174
issue.
richmond
television
was
a
section
162
case,
a
162
issue.
in
the
case
of
cleveland
versus
commissioner,
that
court
found
that
the
expenses
involved
in
a
case
involving
an
attorney
who
financed
an
individual
who
was
in
a
trade
or
business
of
--or
who
was
involved
in
activities
in
working
on
a
formula,
a
patented
product
which
he
had
hoped
to
obtain
the
patent
on.
he
had
advanced
funds
to
this
inventor
over
a
long
period
of
time.
there
were
no
sales
of
this
substance
or
this
item.
there
was
no
patent
as
far
as
i
can
tell
as
of
the
year
at
issue
in
the
cleveland
case.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
patent
was
held
--
was
actively
held
for
sale.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
that
case
that
the
expenses
involved
and
incurred
by
a
joint
venture
between
cleveland
and
the
inventor
in
that
case
who
was
courier
were
deductible
under
section
174.
now,
in
richmond
television
case,
we
have
a
situation
involving
expenditures
by
a
corporation
before
it
obtained
a
license
to
start
operating
a
television
station.
the
expenses
involved
there
were
section
162
expenses
involved
the
training
of
the
employees
and
getting
organized
and
geared
up,
commonly
known
as
"start-up
expenses".
we
feel
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
grasped
the
fine
line
of
distinction
between
section
174
and
section
172
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
a
new
standard
should
be
fashioned
within
section
174
to
take
care
of
174
cases
and
leave
the
section
162
standard
that
has
already
been
fashioned
intact
as
it
is
just
today.
thank
you.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
they're
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
one
of
the
problems
and
this
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
okay.
one
of
the
problems
burns
investment
company
ran
into
in
1966
was
pollution
standard
problem.
now,
the
device
has
been
perfected
at
this
point
in
time
and
it
does
meet
pollution
standards,
thought
it
would
get
in
the
commercial
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
i
am
informed
that
the
trash
burner
in
this
case
does
now
satisfy
all
of
the
ordinances
that
we
know
about
to
date.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
i
have
my
two
minutes
remaining.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
if
i
may
respond
to
the
last
comment
first.
in
1951,
representative
kent
indicated
that
the
american
bar
association
had
urged
section
174.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
i
believe
the
issue
has
really
boiled
down
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
snow
was
in
a
trade
or
business.
that
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
trade
or
business
in
existence.
not
whether
or
not
he
was
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business.
and
in
that
regard,
if
i
might
draw
from
the
regulations
under
a
different
code
section,
and
that
is
section
248.
the
regulations
under
that
section
defines
existence
of
a
trade
or
business
versus
the
beginning
of
a
trade
or
business.
i
am
sorry,
not
trade
or
business
just
business.
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
amortization
of
organization
expenditures
which
is
a
type
of
expenditures
that
is
very
much
akin
to
a
section
174
type
of
expenditure
--
that
is
pre-operating
type
expenditure.
the
regulations
as
promulgated
by
the
commissioner
say
that.
if
the
activities
of
the
corporation
have
advanced
to
the
extent
necessary,
to
establish
the
nature
of
its
business,
the
business
operation.
however,
it
will
be
deemed
to
have
begun
business.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
that
is
section
248,
your
honor.
for
example,
the
acquisition
of
operating
assets
which
are
necessary
to
the
type
of
business
contemplated
may
constitute
the
beginning
of
business.
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
submit
to
you
that
burns
investment
company
had
acquired
everything
it
needed
to
carry
on
the
operation
contemplated
by
burns
investment
company.
it
had
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
separate
corporation
to
manufacture
these
prototype
models
and
this
is
specifically
permitted
under
the
regulations
under
section
174.
it
had
contracted
for
these
services.
it
had
collected
the
capital
from
the
partners.
mr.
trott
devoted
one-third
of
his
time
to
this
venture
and
he
commenced
devoting
his
time
way
back
in
1964
not
in
1966.
this
was
a
continuous
activity
through
this
period
of
time.
it
was
not
a
sporadic
venture
that
just
popped
up
in
1966.
it
was
a
bonafide
business
venture.
this
man
gave
up
a
very
good
position
and
devoted
his
entire
energies
and
efforts
to
the
development
of
these
products.
it
was
certainly
no
play
thing
and
it
was
a
continuing
endeavor
on
his
part.
and
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
chose
to
encourage
by
implementing
into
law,
section
174.
i
am
not
sure
that
we're
clear
on
one
further
point
and
that
is
amortization
versus
deductibility
of
expenses
under
section
174.
that
i
submit
is
a
choice.
if
he
can
amortize
these
expenses,
he
can
deduct
these
expenses
under
section
174.
the
only
remedy
available
to
my
client
if
it
is
held
at
burns
investment
company
is
not
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business,
is
a
capitalization
of
these
expenditures
without
any
depreciation
available
to
him.
thank
you.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
deficiency
in
federal
income
tax
for
the
taxable
year
1966.
the
issue
is
whether
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
his
distributive
share
of
a
net
operating
loss
resulting
from
research
and
experimental
expenditures
incurred
and
paid
by
burns,
a
partnership
during
the
taxable
year
1966.
petitioner
contends
he
is
entitled
to
deduct
his
distributive
share
of
the
net
operating
loss
of
burns
since
the
expenses
giving
rise
to
this
loss
were
incurred
and
paid
during
the
taxable
year
1966
as
research
and
experimental
expenses.
these
expenses
are
covered
by
section
174
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
has
disallowed
these
expenses
upon
audit
of
the
partnership
return
on
the
grounds
that
neither
burns
investment
company
nor
the
petitioner
snow
was
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business.
the
united
states
tax
court
sustained
the
commissioner
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
sustained
the
tax
court's
decision
holding
that
the
expenditures
sought
to
be
deducted
by
burns
investment
company
in
1966
were
pre-operating
expenses
and
not
deductible
under
section
174.
the
facts
of
the
case
were
fairly
simple.
in
1963,
mr.
trott
who
was
the
inventor
of
a
trash-burning
device
and
who
was
also
the
managing
partner
of
burns
investment
company
resigned
from
his
position
with
the
procter
&
gamble
company
and
purchased
an
interest
in
a
small,
closely-held
corporation
doing
business
as
crossbow.
in
addition
to
his
activity
in
crossbow,
mr.
trott
carried
on
research
and
development
work
on
three
different
items:
number
one,
a
telephone
answering
device;
number
two,
a
tape
recorder;
and
number
three,
the
item
at
issue,
a
trash
burner
or
a
leaf
burner.
upon
audit
of
the
partnership
return,
the
internal
revenue
service
held
that
mr.
trott,
the
general
partner
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
an
inventor
by
virtue
of
his
activities
in
these
various
projects.
the
partnerships
which
were
three,
which
were
formed
to
carry
on
these
various
ventures,
were
doing
business
as
echo
development
company
and
that
partnership
was
formed
in
march
of
1965.
the
second
partnership
doing
business
as
courier
enterprises
was
formed
to
carry
on
the
development
of
the
tape
recorder
and
that
partnership
was
also
formed
in
march
of
1965.
the
partnership,
burns
investment
company
which
was
formed
to
carry
on
the
development
of
the
trash
burner
was
formed
in
1966.
all
three
partnerships
was
formed
for
the
same
purpose,
and
that
was
the
development,
securing
patents
on
and
finally
either
producing
or
licensing
another
manufacture
to
produce
these
various
items.
during
1966,
echo
and
courier
--
1966
is
the
year
at
issue
and
during
1966,
echo
and
courier
had
completed
products
--
that
is
the
tape
recorder,
and
the
telephone
answering
device
which
was
then
held
available
for
sale
or
licensing.
patents
had
been
applied
for,
in
the
case
of
the
telephone
answering
device
as
of
august
the
16th,
1966.
patents
had
been
applied
for,
in
the
case
of
the
tape
recorder
as
of
november
22,
1967.
patents
for
the
trash
burner
was
applied
for
as
of
june
10,
1968
and
in
each
instance,
patents
were
granted.
and
in
the
case
of
the
trash
burner,
foreign
patents
have
been
granted
in
at
least
14
foreign
countries.
the
internal
revenue
service
held
that
burns
investment
company
was
not
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
during
the
taxable
year
1966.
the
internal
revenue
service
did
not
see
fit
to
disturb
the
status
of
echo
or
courier,
the
two
remaining
partnerships.
mr.
trott,
the
inventor
and
the
managing
partner,
testified
that
he
worked
on
the
development
of
the
trash
burner
during
the
years
1964
and
1965,
and
during
that
time,
he
devoted
at
least
one-third
of
his
time
to
that
venture.
on
december
10th
1965,
the
development
of
the
trash
burner
had
advanced
to
the
stage
that
mr.
trott
had
received
an
opinion
from
patent
counsel,
stating
that
"features
of
the
trash
burner
were
then
patentable"
in
his
opinion.
however,
he
advised
against
filing
an
application
for
a
patent
in
december
of
1965
suggesting
that
the
filing
be
held
up
until
a
prototype
had
been
built.
the
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
many
prototypes
had
been
built
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
the
prototype,
to
which
we
allude
as
existing
in
1965,
was
a
rather
crude
prototype
model
that
admittedly
did
have
some
flaws
in
it.
it
did
not
work
well.
the
second
letter
which
was
received
from
patent
counsel
in
february
of
1966,
pointed
out
that
the
prototype
that
was
then
in
existence
needed
further
modification,
again
in
the
opinion
of
patent
counsel.
after
receiving
the
letter
from
patent
counsel
advising
of
that
fact
in
1966,
mr.
trott
proceeded
to
form
the
partnership
burns
investment
company
to
raise
capital
to
further
develop
the
trash
burner.
after
forming
the
partnership,
articles
of
partnership
were
drawn
up
and
filed
with
the
hamilton
county
reporter's
office.
the
partners
paid
in
their
capital
contributions
to
the
extent
of
$40,000.00.
the
partnership
proceeded
to
secure
its
federal
employer
identification
number.
it
proceeded
to
establish
its
bank
accounts.
it
set
up
its
books
and
records.
it
filed
its
federal
income
tax
return.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor,
the
office
of
burns
investment
company
was
in
the
facilities
of
the
closely-held
corporation,
crossbow.
mr.

no,
your

not.
mr.

the
business
--
mr.

that
business
was
located
within
the
same
building
as
crossbow.
it
did
not
have
a

on
the
door
and
it
did
not
have
a
telephone.

was

was
--
mr.
burgess

doan
yes
your
honor,
we
have
to
show
we
have
a
partnership
business.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor,
we
submit
that
his
business
is
the
research
and
the
experimental
activity
carried
on
in
perfecting
the
trash
burner.
the
partnership
burns
investment
company
did
enter
into
a
contractual
relationship
with
crossbow
and
with
other
suppliers
obligating
itself
for
goods
and
services.
it
conducted
regular
partnership
meetings
regarding
the
development
work,
regarding
tests
and
experiments
that
were
carried
on,
regarding
the
design
of
the
trash
burner,
regarding
the
various
marketing
methods
on
how
the
trash
burner
could
best
be
brought
to
the
commercial
market.
the
partnership
burns
did
not
have
a
trash
burner
that
was
then
available
for
sale
to
the
market
in
1966.
section
174
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
that
a
taxpayer
may
deduct
research
and
experimental
expenditures
paid
or
incurred
by
him
during
the
taxable
year
in
connection
with
his
trade
or
business.
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
these
expenses
involved
in
this
case
being
a
research
and
experimental
expenses
within
the
meaning
of
section
174.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
no,
your
honor.
there
is
not.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
we
admit
to
that,
your
honor.
the
term
trade
or
business
is
nowhere
defined
in
section
174
or
in
the
commissioner's
regulations
under
section
174.
the
respondent
contends
in
this
case
that
the
term
trade
or
business
has
the
same
meaning
in
section
174
as
it
has
in
other
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
however,
the
case
law
relied
upon
in
support
of
this
proposition
in
every
instance
goes
back
to
a
section
162
standard.
and
162
allows
expenses
incurred
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business.
section
162
has
other
standards
as
well.
specifically,
section
162
provides
that
a
taxpayer
may
deduct
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
incurred
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business
while
section
174
has
a
different
standard.
section
174
says
that
the
taxpayer
may
deduct
research
and
experimental
expenditures
incurred
or
paid
during
the
taxable
year
in
connection
with
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
to
satisfy
the
standard
trade
or
business.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
never,
your
honor
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
the
basis
of
the
respondent's
contention
in
this
case
goes
back
to
an
early
decision
written
by
this
court
where
the
theory
was
advanced
that
before
a
taxpayer
could
be
said
to
be
sharing
on
a
trade
or
business,
he
must
be
holding
himself
out
as
offering
for
sale
goods
or
services.
we
submit
that
that
standard
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
section
174
which
was
not
written
until
1954.
we
believe
that
this
is
borne
out
by
the
legislative
history
found
in
the
committee
reports
in
connection
with
the
development
of
section
174.
we
believe
that
section
174
was
intended
to
be
a
liberalizing
provision
to
allow
these
expenditures
which
otherwise
would
have
to
be
capitalized
to
be
deductible
in
the
year
incurred.
the
legislative
history
of
174
indicates
a
broad
purpose
to
provide
an
economic
incentive
especially
for
small
and
growing
businesses
to
engage
in
the
research
for
new
products
and
new
inventions.
the
measure
was
initially
introduced
in
the
congress
in
1951
and
the
purpose
for
its
introduction
was
to
clarify
the
existing
confusion
in
respect
to
tax
treatment
of
such
expenditures
and
to
prevent
tax
discriminations
between
large,
existing,
well-established
businesses
and
their
small
beginning
counterparts.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
the
best
illustration
of
that
is
best
universal
lock
company.
the
case
decided
in
1966
by
the
tax
court.
best
universal
lock
company
involved
a
corporation,
a
successful
large
corporation
based
in
the
state
of
indiana
which
had
historically
been
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
locks.
during
the
1960's,
best
lock
company
decided
to
develop
a
new
line
of
business
and
it
as
a
result,
commenced
a
research
program
on
isothermal
air
compressors
which
was
admittedly
a
completely
unrelated
line
of
business.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
disallowed
it
saying
that
research
and
development
expenses
claimed
in
this
connection
were
not
deductible.
however,
the
tax
court
reversed
or
did
not
hold
for
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
in
that
case
and
said
that
these
businesses
were
sufficiently
or
these
expenditures
were
sufficiently
connected
with
an
ongoing
business
and
therefore
deductible.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
has
acquiest
in
that
decision
and
in
1973,
the
commissioner
has
issued
a
revenue
ruling
directing
the
employees
at
the
audit
level
and
on
up
through
the
ranks
of
the
internal
revenue
service
that
this
decision
will
be
valid.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor
and
there
lies
the
discrimination
against
my
client.
the
remarks
of
mr.
reed
who
was
then
chairman
of
the
house
committee
on
ways
and
means
in
the
hearings
on
hr
8300,
the
bill
which
embodied
what
was
to
become
the
revenue
code
of
1954,
i
believe
makes
this
point
very
clear.
he
stated
and
i
quote,
"the
present
law
contains
no
statutory
provisions
dealing
with
the
deduction
of
these
expenses".
the
result
has
been
confusion
and
uncertainty.
very
often
under
present
law,
small
businesses
which
are
developing
new
products
and
do
not
have
established
research
departments
are
not
allowed
to
deduct
their
expenses
despite
the
fact
that
the
large,
well-established
competitors
can
obtain
the
deduction.
this
provision
will
greatly
stimulate
the
search
for
new
products
and
new
inventions
upon
which
the
future
economic
and
military
strength
of
a
nation
depends.
it
will
be
particularly
valuable
to
small
and
growing
businesses.
throughout
the
committee
reports,
the
term
pops
up
small
and
growing
businesses.
the
undersecretary
of
the
treasury
when
he
appeared
before
that
ways
and
means
committee
testifying
as
to
the
present
treatment
of
these
expenses
used
the
same
analogy
except
that
he
used
the
term
that
this
will
help
small
pioneering
businesses.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor,
if
a
taxpayer
cannot
utilize
section
174,
and
the
expenses
are
held
to
be
in
the
category
of
pre-operating
expenses
or
investigatory-type
expenses,
there
is
no
provision
for
any
relief
for
tax
purposes
except
when
the
venture
may
be
abandoned
or
when
it
might
be
sold.
that
is
the
venture
itself
not
an
item
within
the
venture.
there's
no
provision
for
these
expenditures
being
capitalized
and
amortized
over
the
useful
life
because
it
is
and
has
been
the
position
of
the
treasury
that
you
cannot
determine
a
useful
life
and
therefore
they
are
not
subject
to
depreciation
or
amortization.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
especially
if
this
is
a
genuine
and
bona
fide
business
venture
where
the
people
are
in
there
trying.
they
put
it
together
and
it
does
become
an
ongoing
business.
it
grows
up
and
it
becomes
a
polaroid,
a
xerox,
and
ibm.
that
capital
contribution
would
be
locked
in
for
any
period
of
time.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
no,
your
honor.
hopefully,
it
will.
we
believe
however,
the
clear
congressional
intent,
is
that
a
small
business
like
burns
whose
entire
energies
are
devoted
to
a
product
development
effort
would
seem
to
be
precisely
the
kind
of
taxpayer
that
congress
sought
to
bring
within
the
reach
of
section
174.
the
decision
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
snow
however
makes
that
section
unavailable
to
burns
while
preserving
it
to
large
and
well-established
competitors.
the
by-product
of
that
decision,
in
my
opinion,
will
foster
monopoly.
it
will
stifle
research
and
development
activity.
it
will
continue
the
discrimination
against
small
businesses
that
section
174
was
designed
to
eliminate.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
the
decisions
are
not
clear,
your
honor.
the
test
that
respondent
has
suggested
would
require
holding
a
product
or
a
service
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
for
sale.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
not
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
that
is
the
contention
of
the
respondent,
your
honor.
however,
we
feel
that
section
--
that
is
a
section
162
standard
but
that's
only
part
of
it.
section
162
says,
ordinary
and
necessary
in
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business.
there
are
three
elements
involved
in
section
162,
the
total
standard.
now,
in
section
174,
congress
did
not
choose
to
include
any
of
those.
respondent
suggests
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
the
two
you
mentioned,
your
honor,
"ordinary
and
necessary".
however,
i
contend
that
the
carrying
on
standard
was
also
eliminated.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
we,
of
course,
rely
heavily
on
cleveland
versus
commissioner
which
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondent
on
the
other
hand,
relies
on
a
later
fourth
circuit
decision,
richmond
television.
cleveland
versus
commissioner
was
a
section
174
case,
a
section
174
issue.
richmond
television
was
a
section
162
case,
a
162
issue.
in
the
case
of
cleveland
versus
commissioner,
that
court
found
that
the
expenses
involved
in
a
case
involving
an
attorney
who
financed
an
individual
who
was
in
a
trade
or
business
of
--or
who
was
involved
in
activities
in
working
on
a
formula,
a
patented
product
which
he
had
hoped
to
obtain
the
patent
on.
he
had
advanced
funds
to
this
inventor
over
a
long
period
of
time.
there
were
no
sales
of
this
substance
or
this
item.
there
was
no
patent
as
far
as
i
can
tell
as
of
the
year
at
issue
in
the
cleveland
case.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
patent
was
held
--
was
actively
held
for
sale.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
that
case
that
the
expenses
involved
and
incurred
by
a
joint
venture
between
cleveland
and
the
inventor
in
that
case
who
was
courier
were
deductible
under
section
174.
now,
in
richmond
television
case,
we
have
a
situation
involving
expenditures
by
a
corporation
before
it
obtained
a
license
to
start
operating
a
television
station.
the
expenses
involved
there
were
section
162
expenses
involved
the
training
of
the
employees
and
getting
organized
and
geared
up,
commonly
known
as
"start-up
expenses".
we
feel
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
grasped
the
fine
line
of
distinction
between
section
174
and
section
172
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
a
new
standard
should
be
fashioned
within
section
174
to
take
care
of
174
cases
and
leave
the
section
162
standard
that
has
already
been
fashioned
intact
as
it
is
just
today.
thank
you.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
they're
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
one
of
the
problems
and
this
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
okay.
one
of
the
problems
burns
investment
company
ran
into
in
1966
was
pollution
standard
problem.
now,
the
device
has
been
perfected
at
this
point
in
time
and
it
does
meet
pollution
standards,
thought
it
would
get
in
the
commercial
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
i
am
informed
that
the
trash
burner
in
this
case
does
now
satisfy
all
of
the
ordinances
that
we
know
about
to
date.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
i
have
my
two
minutes
remaining.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
if
i
may
respond
to
the
last
comment
first.
in
1951,
representative
kent
indicated
that
the
american
bar
association
had
urged
section
174.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
i
believe
the
issue
has
really
boiled
down
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
snow
was
in
a
trade
or
business.
that
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
trade
or
business
in
existence.
not
whether
or
not
he
was
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business.
and
in
that
regard,
if
i
might
draw
from
the
regulations
under
a
different
code
section,
and
that
is
section
248.
the
regulations
under
that
section
defines
existence
of
a
trade
or
business
versus
the
beginning
of
a
trade
or
business.
i
am
sorry,
not
trade
or
business
just
business.
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
amortization
of
organization
expenditures
which
is
a
type
of
expenditures
that
is
very
much
akin
to
a
section
174
type
of
expenditure
--
that
is
pre-operating
type
expenditure.
the
regulations
as
promulgated
by
the
commissioner
say
that.
if
the
activities
of
the
corporation
have
advanced
to
the
extent
necessary,
to
establish
the
nature
of
its
business,
the
business
operation.
however,
it
will
be
deemed
to
have
begun
business.
mr.
burgess
l.
doan
that
is
section
248,
your
honor.
for
example,
the
acquisition
of
operating
assets
which
are
necessary
to
the
type
of
business
contemplated
may
constitute
the
beginning
of
business.
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
submit
to
you
that
burns
investment
company
had
acquired
everything
it
needed
to
carry
on
the
operation
contemplated
by
burns
investment
company.
it
had
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
separate
corporation
to
manufacture
these
prototype
models
and
this
is
specifically
permitted
under
the
regulations
under
section
174.
it
had
contracted
for
these
services.
it
had
collected
the
capital
from
the
partners.
mr.
trott
devoted
one-third
of
his
time
to
this
venture
and
he
commenced
devoting
his
time
way
back
in
1964
not
in
1966.
this
was
a
continuous
activity
through
this
period
of
time.
it
was
not
a
sporadic
venture
that
just
popped
up
in
1966.
it
was
a
bonafide
business
venture.
this
man
gave
up
a
very
good
position
and
devoted
his
entire
energies
and
efforts
to
the
development
of
these
products.
it
was
certainly
no
play
thing
and
it
was
a
continuing
endeavor
on
his
part.
and
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
chose
to
encourage
by
implementing
into
law,
section
174.
i
am
not
sure
that
we're
clear
on
one
further
point
and
that
is
amortization
versus
deductibility
of
expenses
under
section
174.
that
i
submit
is
a
choice.
if
he
can
amortize
these
expenses,
he
can
deduct
these
expenses
under
section
174.
the
only
remedy
available
to
my
client
if
it
is
held
at
burns
investment
company
is
not
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business,
is
a
capitalization
of
these
expenditures
without
any
depreciation
available
to
him.
thank
you.
