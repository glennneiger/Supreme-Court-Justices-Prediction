company.
mr.
spiegelman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
spiegelman,
are
you
raising
another
issue
in
the
case
of
ineffective
assistance?
and
if
so,
do
you
think
that
could
be
attributed
to
the
employer,
the
consequences
of
ineffective
assistance
or
is
that
an
action,
is
that
a
proceeding
against
the
union?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
spiegelman,
you
referred
to
screening
out
good
many
of
these
potential
claims
could
be
screened
out
in
the
grievance
and
then
you
said
also
in
the
arbitration
but
will
they
be
screened
out
in
the
arbitration
in
the
cases
where
the
employer
prevails
on
your
theory
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace
you
seem
to
make
a
sharp
distinction
both
in
your
brief
and
in
your
argument
between
rights
arising
out
of
the
contract
and
rights
arising
out
of
the
statute
but
is
it
not
true
that
this
contract
provides
for
protection
against
discriminatory
action
against
employees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
arbitrator
in
a
given
case
addresses
himself
to
the
claim
of
racial
discrimination
and
decides
that
adversely
to
the
employer,
the
man
is
reinstated,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
has
all
the
remedies
that
he
could
get
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
had
expressly
raised
and
vigorously
pressed
the
claim
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
arbitration,
would
you
think
that
the
scope
of
remedy
would
be
any
less
than
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
normal
remedy
would
be
reinstatement
of
backpay,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
good.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
concept
of
his
having
options
that
you
seem
to
be
pressing,
do
i
understand
you
to
mean
that
he
might,
the
employee
might
as
a
matter
of
choice
ignore
all
the
grievance
procedure,
all
of
the
arbitration
procedure
and
he
lacked
to
proceed
under
the
statute
right
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
he
did
that,
you
would
not
think
you
have
any
defense
by
way
of
asserting
this,
the
arbitration
clause
had
to
be
exhausted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
good.
