justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there’s
not
one
word
of
“race”
in
his
letter
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
in
the
world
can
you
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
didn’t
say,
i
was
discriminated
because
of
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
might
have
been
discriminated
because
of
the
way
cut
his
hair
or
his
union
membership
has
not
a
word
in
“race”
in
the
arbitrators’
find.
he
didn’t
mention
“race”
once.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
under
the
sun
can
we
assume
race
was
before
the
arbitration
committee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how?
well,
as
i
understand
the
only
evidence
that
was
raised
was
this
letter.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
didn’t
say,
“i
am
raising
it
there.”
he
said,
“i
am
raising
it
over
in
other
place.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn’t
your
argument
be
the
same
even
it
that
have
been
raised?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
same
letter
that’s
in
the
appendix?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
letter
that’s
in
the
appendix?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
in
that
letter
says
“race?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
means
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
mean
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
do
you
know
when
the
context
of
these
cases
that
a
negro
got
preferential
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
in
the
interest
of
cases
like
this
can
you
name
me
where
negro
got
preferential
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
think
that
letter
gets
a
basis
for
a
claim
of
racial
discrimination
on
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mind
if
i
don’t?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
take
in
to
consideration
that
the
court
is
to
be
bound
by
an
arbitration
where
no
witnesses
are
sworn,
no
cross-examination
and
no
discovery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
consent
of
the
employer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
employee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can’t
conceive
of
that
at
all
under
title
vii.
you
see,
my
trouble
is
title
vii
gave
the
employee
a
right
of
the
full
plenary
hearing,
discovery
everything
under
the
sun
that
his
lawyer
could
think
of
and
in
place
of
that,
you
say
he
gives
up
by
taking
arbitration
where
one;
he
doesn’t
have
employer.
2;
he
does
not
have
court
procedure.
he
doesn’t
have
sworn
testimony,
so
he’s
given
–-
he
is
not
taken
two
equal
forums.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
taken
the
lesser
forum.
now,
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
while
this
lesser
arbitration
was
going
on?
he
made
it
clear
that
he
prefered
his
title
vii
rights
during
that
arbitration
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
can
you
say
he
gave
it
up
if
he
filed
but
he
did
file
while
it
was
pending,
didn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
context
of
title
vii
is
a
different
situation.
he
didn’t
have
a
lawyer.
he
had
a
union.
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn’t
he
disavow
when
he
filed
this
title
vii
action?
you
are
in
the
arbitration,
didn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he
started
the
state
proceeding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn’t
that
say
i
disavow
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
didn’t
he
say
i
don’t
trust
this
or
what
did
it
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
certainly,
didn’t
say
he
was
satisfied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
before
both?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wait
a
minute.
he
showed
the
knowledge
of
that
statutory
proceeding
when
arbitration
was
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that
was
after
arbitration
had
started?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
going
on
with
the
arbitration
in
the
meantime,
they
just
weren’t
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
i
thought,
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
got
dissatisfied
with
his
representative,
the
union.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
is
that
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there’s
not
one
word
of

in
his

at
