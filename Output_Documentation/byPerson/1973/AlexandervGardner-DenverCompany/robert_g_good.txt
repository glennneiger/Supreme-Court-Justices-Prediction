mr.
robert
g.
good
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
robert
good
from
denver,
colorado
representing
the
respondent
here
gardner-denver
company.
prior
to
submitting
to
company’s
legal
position
i
would
like
to
highlight
a
few
of
the
facts
involving
alexander’s
case.
he
had
been
twice
warned
prior
to
his
discharge.
on
the
first
to
those
occasions,
the
company
volunteered
80
extra
hours
of
instruction
and
study
to
mr.
alexander.
on
the
second
of
those
occasions,
he
was
disciplinarily
suspended
for
two
days
and
of
course
on
the
third
occasion,
he
was
fired.
merely
upon
his
firing
he
and
the
union
invoked
the
four
steps
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
early
in
those
steps
he
submitted
to
the
union
his
letter
which
impart
accused
the
company
of
discrimination
treatment.
that
letter
was
read
to
the
arbitration
at
the
hearing.
the
contract
proscribed
employment
discrimination
and
also
proscribed
any
discharge
not
based
on
just
cause.
it
is
true
that
alexander
filed
with
the
state
commission
prior
to
the
arbitration
hearing
and
eeoc
assumed
jurisdiction
also
prior
to
the
arbitration
hearing.
it
is
also
true
however,
that
seven
months
after
the
arbitrator’s
award,
the
eeoc
found
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
gardner-denver
company
had
violated
the
act
relative
to
mr.
alexander’s
discharge.
mr.
robert
g.
good
this
is
true.
mr.
robert
g.
good
it’s
difficult
to
answer
that
mr.
justice.
in
the
state
proceedings,
they
were
terminated
without
explanation.
in
the
colorado
practices
there
could
very
well
be
explanations
having
nothing
to
do
with
an
indication
of
guilt
or
innocence,
case
load
for
instance.
eeoc
assumed
jurisdiction,
so
we
can
not
tell
anything
from
the
state
proceedings.
in
the
federal
proceedings,
the
company
did
submit
although
this
is
not
in
the
appendix,
did
submit
the
arbitration
award
in
the
investigation.
mr.
robert
g.
good
we
do
not
know
mr.
justice.
incidentally,
some
concern
was
raised
here
that
the
issue
of
race
was
not
before
the
arbitrator.
if
i
may
briefly
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
some
of
the
testimonies
of
mr.
alexander
in
that
the
deposition
is
contained
at
page
13
of
the
appendix.
question
of
mr.
alexander:
now,
at
the
arbitration,
who
was
that
that
raised
the
issue
of
race?
answer:
mr.
berg.
mr.
berg
was
a
union
representative.
question:
how
did
he
raise
that?
answer:
by
the
letter
that
i
wrote
him
explaining
my
position
and
what
i
had
discovered.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice?
mr.
robert
g.
good
this
is
the
letter
that’s
in
the
appendix,
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
nothing
specifically
says
race.
there’s
an
allusion
to
preferential
discriminatory
treatment
and
mr.
alexander
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
does
in
the
context
–-
mr.
robert
g.
good
would
you
repeat
the
question?
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
as
you
will
notice
from
a
review
of
this
particular
letter
it
was
a
joint
draft
between
his
pastor
and
himself
and
you
will
notice
that
it
is
not
in
the
highest
of
art
forms.
the
language
selected
of
course
is
clearly
layman’s
language.
a
review
of
that
letter
in
several
instances
shows
that
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes
sir,
when
combined
with
mr.
alexander’s
later
description
of
what
he
intended.
mr.
robert
g.
good
not
at
all
sir.
incidentally,
in
the
lower
court,
the
employer
moved
under
rule
56
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
alleging
that
race
was
before
the
arbitrator
and
it
ought
not
be
re-litigated
in
district
court.
interestingly
enough,
alexander
in
the
lower
court
never
did
deny
that
race
was
before
the
arbitrator.
and
of
course
as
you
know
under
rule
56,
he
can
come
forward
with
counter
affidavits
or
other
evidence
to
indicate
that
there
truly
is
a
question
of
fact.
he
came
forward
with
no
such
statement
nor
any
statement
that
the
arbitration
proceedings
were
not
fair
and
regular.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
good
indeed
he
does.
the
company’s
position
simply
stated
is
that
an
employee
having
statutory
claim
cannot
be
required
to
submit
his
claim
to
the
arbitration
process.
he
may
however
do
so
voluntarily
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
gives
the
arbitrator
jurisdiction
over
that
claim.
and
when
he
does
so
he
must
be
bound
except
to
the
extent
that
considering
the
overriding
public
policy
considerations
in
the
civil
rights
act,
the
district
court
function
must
be
that
of
an
overview
of
the
arbitration
ex
post
facto
that
is
after
the
arbitration
and
when
the
title
vii
is
filed,
the
district
court
should
review
it
to
determine
first
if
the
statutory
issue
was
before
the
arbitrator.
second,
did
the
contract
of
the
arbitrator
jurisdiction
over
it
and
third,
of
course
did
a
final
opinion
in
award
of
the
arbitrator
offend
any
of
the
underlying
policies
in
the
act.
if
the
answer
is
appropriate
in
each
of
those
instances
deferral
ought
to
be
granted.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that
is
correct.
we
say
the
court
maintains
the
power
–-
mr.
robert
g.
good
to
give
an
overview,
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
indeed
despite
the
provisions
of
section
301
in
steelworkers
trilogy
because
the
overriding
public
interest
in
the
matter.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
think
mr.
justice
one
can
learn
a
different
reading
to
your
quote
there.
the
district
court,
judge
winner
in
employing
this
language
could
be
inferring,
we
have
the
power
to
permit
alexander
to
proceed
but
in
this
case
since
it
was
a
voluntary
submission
the
award
should
be
consider
final
and
binding.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
that’s
correct
and
i
am
saying
that
the
district
court
here
conformed
to
that
policy.
you
will
note
for
several
pages
the
district
court
examines
the
underlying
public
policy
of
the
civil
rights
act
before
reaching
his
decision
and
so
he
certainly
was
attempting
to
examine
the
arbitrator’s
award
in
light
of
those
policies.
he
had
already
found
that
race
was
an
issue
before
the
arbitrator
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
he
then,
as
i
read
it
mr.
justice,
declines
to
exercise
the
power
of
the
court
to
permit
alexander
to
proceed.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
sir.
only
to
initially
determine
was
the
statutory
right
before
the
arbitrator
and
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
perhaps
none
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
except
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
he
has
one
more
condition,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
final
opinion
and
award
can
not
offend
the
underlying
policies
of
this
public
policies
statute.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
on
a
preliminary
peak,
he
determines
as
here
that
in
the
arbitrators
award
that
he
--
did
he
do
anything
to
offend
the
policies
of
the
act
and
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
only
review
in
that
particular
case
mr.
justice
would
be
exercised
i
would
think
by
the
nlrb
and
that
would
not
be
a
review
it
would
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
perhaps
that’s
correct
mr.
justice.
i’ve
been
looking
at
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
this
is
true.
title
vii
however
is
an
explicit
statute
designed
to
preserve
the
privileges
of
the
minority
employee.
it
truly
would
have
been
a
foolish-sounding
civil
rights
act
for
it
to
read
that
your
employment
rights
are
enforceable
under
your
agreement
and
a
final
arbitrators
award
shall
represent
the
state
of
the
law
as
congress
sees
it.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
mr.
justice
because
the
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
because
here
the
key
is
the
consent
of
the
employee.
title
vii
gave
that
employee
a
right
to
sue
his
employer
and
there’s
no
question
about
that.
however,
he
is
the
possessor
of
that
right
as
the
possessor,
he
can
use
it
fully
by
filing
a
full
title
vii
class
and
in
visual
action
he
can
use
it
partially
as
alexander
did
by
filing
only
individual
action.
he
can
use
it
not
at
all
or
he
can
submit
it
to
another
form.
the
key
is
the
consent
of
the
employee.
mr.
robert
g.
good
he.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
agree,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
if
i
may
answer
that
in
two
ways
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
indeed
he
did.
we
view
that
differently
than
counsel
does.
here
is
man
who
presses
race,
the
racial
issue
before
the
arbitrator
and
at
the
same
time
simultaneously
invokes
the
state
procedures
under
the
statute.
when
he
thereafter
proceeds
to
press
the
arbitration
racial
issue,
he’s
indicating
one;
that
he
has
knowledge
of
his
statutory
rights
because
he’s
already
filed
under
the
state
and
two,
when
he
presses
that
issue,
he’s
indicating
his
selection
of
the
two
areas
or
the
two
remedies.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes
sir,
but
you
should
remember
here
he
had
access
to
the
state
civil
rights
agency
and
to
the
federal
civil
rights
agency
at
a
point
prior
to
his
submitting
the
racial
issue
to
the
arbitrator
and
surely
that
indicates
that
he
had
as
a
good
advice
is
available
anywhere
in
the
land
today.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i’m
sure
he
was
mr.
arbitrator.
mr.
robert
g.
good
he
was
knowledgeable
of
his
statutory
rights.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that
he
was
trying
to
get
both?
he
certainly
is
today,
he
still
trying
to
get
the
other
half.
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
because
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
we
must
–-
we
cannot
ignore
certain
statistics
that
prevailed
here.
as
stated
earlier,
there
are
160,000
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
the
united
states
covering
25
million
employees
94%
of
which
have
binding
arbitration
clauses
and
today
69%
of
those
agreements
have
nondiscrimination
clauses.
now,
alexander’s
case
is
only
in
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
fifth
circuit
in
rios
recommends
deferral
as
dewey.
however
and
i
presume
that
is
what
the
justice
is
talking
about
the
rios
versus
reynolds
metals
case.
there,
they
recommend
deferral
on
the
seventh
stringent
criteria.
we
recommend
what
we
call
a
liberal
deferral
policy.
we
find
the
rios
deferral
policy
unworkable
and
destructive
of
the
arbitration
process.
first,
under
the
rios
deferral
policy,
the
arbitration
has
to
compare
favorably,
substantially
and
procedurally
with
a
hearing
that
the
claimant
would
have
in
the
u.s.
district
court.
further,
the
u.s.
district
court
in
determining
whether
to
defer
has
to
hold
a
hearing
that
i
think
in
lengthy
complexity
is
greater
than
a
normal
title
vii
hearing.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
rios
decision
mr.
justice
is
only
about
five
or
six
months
old
and
so
i
can
not
answer
your
question.
we
do
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
that
act?
mr.
robert
g.
good
there
is
nothing.
the
act
is
totally
barren
of
any
reference
to
prior
arbitration
would.
i
submit
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
but
i
submit
mr.
justice
when
you
consider
the
statistics
i’ve
mentioned
most
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
they
had
to.
they
just
missed
the
whole
point
surely
with
those
tremendous
statistics
whether
they
were
to
permit
the
arbitration
to
stand
or
to
deny
enforcement.
they
would
have
said
one
way
or
the
other
with
this
totally
pervasive
structure
of
our
industrial
relations
staring
them
in
the
face.
they
just
missed
the
vote
and
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
make
reasonable
accommodation
between
these
conflicting
interests.
next,
mr.
justice
marshall
showed
some
concern
that
the
employee
is
participating
in
a
forum
where
the
scope
and
the
dimensions
of
the
hearing,
he
receives
is
something
different
and
what
he
would
receive
in
u.s.
district
court
and
this
is
surely
true.
however,
this
court
has
previously
acknowledged
that
those
differences
do
exist.
this
was
in
the
arguelles
case.
those
differences
do
exist
and
they
are
not
repugnant.
justice
harlan
in
bulk
carriers
stated
it
this
way,
“this
court
has
always
recognized
that
the
choice
of
forms
inevitably
affects
the
scope
of
the
substantive
rights
to
be
vindicated
before
the
chosen
forum.”
in
particular,
where
arbitration
is
concerned,
the
court
has
been
acutely
sensitive
to
these
differences
and
he
goes
on
further
at
a
later
point.
normally,
the
impact
on
the
substantive
rights
resulting
from
the
decision
to
remit
the
individual
to
the
arbitral
forum
is
acceptable
because
the
parties
themselves
have
consented
to
that
forum.”
again,
consent
the
key
here
is
consent.
the
employee
was
given
a
right
to
sue
his
employer.
he
is
possessor
of
that
right.
he
can
use
it
fully,
partially
not
use
it
at
all
or
submit
it
to
another
forum.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
union
filed
it.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
union
did.
mr.
robert
g.
good
our
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
was
by
his
choice
mr.
justice.
it
is
not
part
of
our
premise
or
i
should
say
part
of
our
premise
is
that
if
an
employee,
if
this
would
be
possible
or
required
by
the
union
and
the
employer
to
process
an
arbitration
claim
that
involved
the
title
vii
issue.
if
he
disavowed
that
at
any
point,
he
would
still
have
his
title
vii
yet
available
to
him
because
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
he
commence
the
state
procedures.
he
filed
the
title
vii
action
after
the
arbitration.
mr.
robert
g.
good
this
is
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
says
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
says
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
sir,
it
says
to
me
that,
“i,
alexander,
am
aware
that
i
have
these
alternate
remedies
but
i,
alexander,
choose
to
press
the
discrimination
claim
in
this
arbitral
forum
in
both.
mr.
robert
g.
good
when
he
proceeded
with
the
arbitration,
i
submit
he
made
the
selection
at
that
point.
he
showed
his
ability
to
keep
it,
to
withhold
it
from
arbitration.
he
showed
his
knowledge
of
the
statutory
proceedings.
nevertheless
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
he
had
already
filed
with
a
state
agency.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
sir.
he
filed
with
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
shortly
after
his
discharge
and
the
eeoc
assumed
jurisdiction
before
the
arbitration
also.
so,
both
agencies
had
taken
jurisdiction
prior
to
the
arbitration.
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
was
ascending
to
the
grievance
steps,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
now,
you
recall
though
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
he
says
so
a
year
later
after
he’s
lost
the
arbitration,
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
we
can’t
say
he
was
dissatisfied
at
the
point
of
the
arbitration
which
brings
me
to
another
point.
counsel
stated
that
we
ought
to
allow
the
arbitration
process
to
take
place
because
of
what
i
interpreted
he
was
saying
it’s
therapeutic
vial.
i
submit
to
you
that
it
has
a
lot
of
good
therapy
if
the
employee
wins
but
if
he
loses
it
exacerbates
his
feelings
of
resentment
and
we
have
a
title
vii
action
if
we
doubt
that,
just
look
at
all
the
cases
we
have
cited
in
this
various
briefs.
all
on
this
issue
and
guess
what
always
in
the
arbitration,
he
lost.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
indeed.
mr.
robert
g.
good
not
at
all
compared
to
maddox.
compared
with
maddox
where
the
court
said
thou
shalt
exercise
your
administrator
remedies.
that
was
on
the
contract
however.
here,
it
is
a
statute
with
an
overriding
public
interest
and
incidentally
in
making
the
assertion
that
he
can
not
be
forced
to
arbitration
we
not
only
relied
on
a
literal
words
of
section
706
that
says,
you
do
have
a
right
to
sue
your
employee.
we
rely
on
u.s.
bulk
carriers
versus
arguelles
as
i’ve
heard
it
pronounced
here
this
morning.
and
it’s
true
in
that
case
justice
harlan
did
say
that
the
least
satisfactory
of
all
solutions
is
the
necessity
of
suits
in
both
forms.
now,
my
opposition
points
out
that
or
they
suggest
that
the
1972
amendments
the
civil
rights
act
indicate
a
clear
congressional
intent
that
no
other
forum
was
to
substitute
for
a
title
vii
district
court
forum.
it
is
true
that
the
72
amendments
direct
the
eeoc
to
give
“substantial
way
to
final
orders
or
the
decisions
of
state
local
authorities.”
however,
we
use,
we
view
that
as
a
concern
of
congress
that
an
employee
who
congress
has
required
to
use
the
state
procedures,
they
are
concerned
that
an
employee
be
required
to
be
bound
by
state
procedures
which
contained
infirmities
or
potential
infirmities.
indeed,
senator
clark
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
expressed
exactly
that
concern.
he
stated
“state
and
local
fair
employment
laws
very
widely
in
effectiveness
in
many
areas
effective
enforcement
is
handed
by
inadequate
legislation,
inadequate
procedures,
or
an
inadequate
budget.”
and
you
will
recall
that
now
congress
requires
the
employee
to
first
use
those
procedures.
so
the
concern
of
the
congress
was
that
no
other
sovereign
or
law
or
procedure
require
the
employee
to
accept
less
than
his
full
day
in
court
under
title
vii
if
he
so
chose.
mr.
robert
g.
good
in
so
far
as
it
ruled
deferral
it
went
exactly
as
far
as
we
would
go.
insofar
as
it
defined
the
rules
for
the
district
court
under
which
deferral
was
proper,
it
went
much
too
far.
we
say
it’s
destructive
of
the
arbitration
process
and
unworkable.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
begin
to
argue
at
that
point
mr.
justice
and
the
subsequent
point,
i
believe
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
i
don’t
have
problem
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that
one
and
none
of
the
remaining
ones,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
yes
insofar
as,
i’m
bothered
by
the
one
preceding
it.
that
is
the
evidence
presented
at
the
arbitral
hearing
dealt
adequately
with
all
the
factual
issues.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
problem.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
it
is.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
well,
not
only
with
the
arbitration
process
but
it
imposes
a
duty
on
the
lower
court
to
hold
a
hearing
that
is
its
magnitude
and
complexity
would
go
far
beyond
going
ahead
with
this
title
vii
trial
for
instance,
mr.
justice.
i
believe
you
called
it
the
third
one.
the
evidence
presented
at
the
arbitral
hearing
dealt
adequately
with
all
the
factual
issues.
well,
first
the
court
has
to
determine
what
were
all
the
factual
issues?
and
secondly,
what
would
be
the
factual
issues
if
we
had
a
title
vii
trial?
in
other
words,
did
the
arbitrator
know
all
the
issues?
mr.
robert
g.
good
would
you
repeat
that
mr.
justice,
please?
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
sir.
i
do
not
eliminate
two.
the
arbitrator
had
a
power
to
determine
the
issue.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
problem.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
third
one.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
evidence
presented
at
the
arbitral
hearing
dealt
adequately
with
all
the
factual
issues.
mr.
robert
g.
good
not
insofar
as
the
district
court
must
determine
that
but
we
all
know
from
trial
experience
even
in
a
pretrial
conference.
we
do
not
agree
on
what
all
the
factual
issues
are
and
its
sub-factual
issues
and
always
in
trial
of
the
issues
come
up.
the
judge
under
this
burden
of
rios
would
have
to
hold
a
hearing
that
would
certainly
be
lengthy,
it
would
be
a
retrial
of
the
arbitration
hearing
and
in
fact
the
district
court
would
have
to
substitute
in
many
instances
its
judgment.
mr.
robert
g.
good
if
he
went
in
under
section
301,
do
you
mean
mr.
justice?
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
no.
i
did
not
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
in
most
cases
whether
there
is
no
statute
involved
the
district
court
you
exercise
its
normal
function
to
determine
that
that
the
arbitrator
had
jurisdiction
and
where
the
proceedings
are
fair
and
regular.
mr.
robert
g.
good
we
had
one
thing
and
i
am
not
so
sure
if
they’re
listening
to
mr.
justice
white.
they
were
adding
that
one
thing.
they
were
at
least
underlining
it
and
that
is
that
the
court
must
examine
the
arbitrator’s
opinion
and
award
to
see
if
it
patently
offended
the
underlying
policies
of
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
robert
g.
good
whatever,
civil
rights
law.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
this
is
correct
in
the
view
of
over
90%
of
the
arbitrators,
mr.
justice
white.
there
is
a
small
minority
who
disagree
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
because
he
can
tell
on
the
face
of
the
arbitration
and
some
–-
well,
on
the
face
of
the
arbitration
he
can
tell
whether
it
patently
offensed
the
underlying
policies
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
except
to
the
extent
mr.
justice
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
mclean
case
which
was
shortly
after
rios
seem
to
agree
with
rios.
however,
in
the
mclean
the
court
predicated
that
decision
on
a
statement
that
they
read
into
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
“federal
policy
of
the
deferral.”
well,
that’s
very
presumptuous
reading
considering
the
case
we
are
right
here
that
i’m
talking
about.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
i
have
made
statement
i
did
is
that
i
attend
all
of
these
labor
law
conferences
and
there’s
always
a
isolated
arbitrator
who
gets
up
and
makes
the
statement
that
we’ve
all
heard
so
often,
i’m
merely
a
creature
of
the
parties
and
i
am
only
what
the
parties
make
me
and
if
they
tell
me
to
violate
the
law
and
–-
mr.
robert
g.
good
i’m
unaware
of
any
of
that
say
exactly
that.
i’m
aware
of
this
court’s
assumption
that
an
arbitrator
will
follow
the
law
especially
in
preemption
matters
for
the
problem.
one
item
mentioned
in
my
opponent’s
brief
and
which
i
think
bears
some
response,
the
alexander
appeals
that
sense
of
fairness
of
this
court
and
he
states
in
there
that
if
david
in
the
biblical
confrontation
with
goliath
had
two
stones
to
a
sling,
he
would
not
have
been
unfairly
on
for
that
confrontation
and
thus
by
analogy
says
alexander.
if
alexander
i.e.
david
has
two
cracks
at
my
client
i.e.
goliath,
there’s
nothing
wrong
with
that.
and
then
at
that
point
they
go
on
to
recite
six
different
statutory
procedures
now
available
for
an
employee
to
proceed
against
his
employer.
all
of
which
are
free,
none
of
which
are
exclusive
to
all
of
which
the
employer
must
respond
and
to
which
he
is
bound
in
the
event
of
an
adverse
determination
in
any
one
of
those
forums.
take
all
of
that,
add
to
it
the
fact
that
the
amendments
now
apply
the
act
to
a
business
having
as
few
as
15
employees
and
you
have
to
wonder,
who
in
the
world
is
david
and
who
is
goliath
in
this
industrial
civil
rights
confrontation.
mr.
john
pemberton,
deputy
general
counsel
of
the
eeoc,
former
deputy
general
counsel.
even
in
his
position
was
able
to
show
some
pity
for
the
employer
in
this
dilemma.
he
described
the
dilemma
as
follows:
“if
the
number
of
multiple
employee
remedies
is
not
awesome
enough,
the
lack
of
finality
in
any
decision
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
certainly
poses
a
defendant’s
nightmare.”
surely,
congress
in
defining
title
vii
did
not
intend
nightmare
of
litigation
for
anyone.
it
only
intended
to
create
of
very
powerful
tool
with
which
to
eliminate
employment
discrimination.
for
all
of
these
reasons
we
ask
the
court
to
adopt
a
policy
of
liberal
deferral
to
find
that
the
lower
court
did
conform
to
that
policy
and
to
affirm
for
those
reasons.
mr.
chief
justice,
absent
any
further
questions
i
submit
the
case
on
behalf
of
my
client
gardner-denver
company.
mr.
robert
g.
good
thank
you
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
good
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
robert
good
from
denver,
colorado
representing
the
respondent
here
gardner-denver
company.
prior
to
submitting
to
company’s
legal
position
i
would
like
to
highlight
a
few
of
the
facts
involving
alexander’s
case.
he
had
been
twice
warned
prior
to
his
discharge.
on
the
first
to
those
occasions,
the
company
volunteered
80
extra
hours
of
instruction
and
study
to
mr.
alexander.
on
the
second
of
those
occasions,
he
was
disciplinarily
suspended
for
two
days
and
of
course
on
the
third
occasion,
he
was
fired.
merely
upon
his
firing
he
and
the
union
invoked
the
four
steps
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
early
in
those
steps
he
submitted
to
the
union
his
letter
which
impart
accused
the
company
of
discrimination
treatment.
that
letter
was
read
to
the
arbitration
at
the
hearing.
the
contract
proscribed
employment
discrimination
and
also
proscribed
any
discharge
not
based
on
just
cause.
it
is
true
that
alexander
filed
with
the
state
commission
prior
to
the
arbitration
hearing
and
eeoc
assumed
jurisdiction
also
prior
to
the
arbitration
hearing.
it
is
also
true
however,
that
seven
months
after
the
arbitrator’s
award,
the
eeoc
found
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
gardner-denver
company
had
violated
the
act
relative
to
mr.
alexander’s
discharge.
mr.
robert
g.
good
this
is
true.
mr.
robert
g.
good
it’s
difficult
to
answer
that
mr.
justice.
in
the
state
proceedings,
they
were
terminated
without
explanation.
in
the
colorado
practices
there
could
very
well
be
explanations
having
nothing
to
do
with
an
indication
of
guilt
or
innocence,
case
load
for
instance.
eeoc
assumed
jurisdiction,
so
we
can
not
tell
anything
from
the
state
proceedings.
in
the
federal
proceedings,
the
company
did
submit
although
this
is
not
in
the
appendix,
did
submit
the
arbitration
award
in
the
investigation.
mr.
robert
g.
good
we
do
not
know
mr.
justice.
incidentally,
some
concern
was
raised
here
that
the
issue
of
race
was
not
before
the
arbitrator.
if
i
may
briefly
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
some
of
the
testimonies
of
mr.
alexander
in
that
the
deposition
is
contained
at
page
13
of
the
appendix.
question
of
mr.
alexander:
now,
at
the
arbitration,
who
was
that
that
raised
the
issue
of
race?
answer:
mr.
berg.
mr.
berg
was
a
union
representative.
question:
how
did
he
raise
that?
answer:
by
the
letter
that
i
wrote
him
explaining
my
position
and
what
i
had
discovered.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice?
mr.
robert
g.
good
this
is
the
letter
that’s
in
the
appendix,
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
nothing
specifically
says
race.
there’s
an
allusion
to
preferential
discriminatory
treatment
and
mr.
alexander
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
does
in
the
context
–-
mr.
robert
g.
good
would
you
repeat
the
question?
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
as
you
will
notice
from
a
review
of
this
particular
letter
it
was
a
joint
draft
between
his
pastor
and
himself
and
you
will
notice
that
it
is
not
in
the
highest
of
art
forms.
the
language
selected
of
course
is
clearly
layman’s
language.
a
review
of
that
letter
in
several
instances
shows
that
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes
sir,
when
combined
with
mr.
alexander’s
later
description
of
what
he
intended.
mr.
robert
g.
good
not
at
all
sir.
incidentally,
in
the
lower
court,
the
employer
moved
under
rule
56
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
alleging
that
race
was
before
the
arbitrator
and
it
ought
not
be
re-litigated
in
district
court.
interestingly
enough,
alexander
in
the
lower
court
never
did
deny
that
race
was
before
the
arbitrator.
and
of
course
as
you
know
under
rule
56,
he
can
come
forward
with
counter
affidavits
or
other
evidence
to
indicate
that
there
truly
is
a
question
of
fact.
he
came
forward
with
no
such
statement
nor
any
statement
that
the
arbitration
proceedings
were
not
fair
and
regular.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
good
indeed
he
does.
the
company’s
position
simply
stated
is
that
an
employee
having
statutory
claim
cannot
be
required
to
submit
his
claim
to
the
arbitration
process.
he
may
however
do
so
voluntarily
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
gives
the
arbitrator
jurisdiction
over
that
claim.
and
when
he
does
so
he
must
be
bound
except
to
the
extent
that
considering
the
overriding
public
policy
considerations
in
the
civil
rights
act,
the
district
court
function
must
be
that
of
an
overview
of
the
arbitration
ex
post
facto
that
is
after
the
arbitration
and
when
the
title
vii
is
filed,
the
district
court
should
review
it
to
determine
first
if
the
statutory
issue
was
before
the
arbitrator.
second,
did
the
contract
of
the
arbitrator
jurisdiction
over
it
and
third,
of
course
did
a
final
opinion
in
award
of
the
arbitrator
offend
any
of
the
underlying
policies
in
the
act.
if
the
answer
is
appropriate
in
each
of
those
instances
deferral
ought
to
be
granted.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that
is
correct.
we
say
the
court
maintains
the
power
–-
mr.
robert
g.
good
to
give
an
overview,
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that’s
right.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
indeed
despite
the
provisions
of
section
301
in
steelworkers
trilogy
because
the
overriding
public
interest
in
the
matter.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
think
mr.
justice
one
can
learn
a
different
reading
to
your
quote
there.
the
district
court,
judge
winner
in
employing
this
language
could
be
inferring,
we
have
the
power
to
permit
alexander
to
proceed
but
in
this
case
since
it
was
a
voluntary
submission
the
award
should
be
consider
final
and
binding.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
that’s
correct
and
i
am
saying
that
the
district
court
here
conformed
to
that
policy.
you
will
note
for
several
pages
the
district
court
examines
the
underlying
public
policy
of
the
civil
rights
act
before
reaching
his
decision
and
so
he
certainly
was
attempting
to
examine
the
arbitrator’s
award
in
light
of
those
policies.
he
had
already
found
that
race
was
an
issue
before
the
arbitrator
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
he
then,
as
i
read
it
mr.
justice,
declines
to
exercise
the
power
of
the
court
to
permit
alexander
to
proceed.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
sir.
only
to
initially
determine
was
the
statutory
right
before
the
arbitrator
and
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
perhaps
none
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
except
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
he
has
one
more
condition,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
final
opinion
and
award
can
not
offend
the
underlying
policies
of
this
public
policies
statute.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
on
a
preliminary
peak,
he
determines
as
here
that
in
the
arbitrators
award
that
he
--
did
he
do
anything
to
offend
the
policies
of
the
act
and
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
only
review
in
that
particular
case
mr.
justice
would
be
exercised
i
would
think
by
the
nlrb
and
that
would
not
be
a
review
it
would
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
perhaps
that’s
correct
mr.
justice.
i’ve
been
looking
at
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
this
is
true.
title
vii
however
is
an
explicit
statute
designed
to
preserve
the
privileges
of
the
minority
employee.
it
truly
would
have
been
a
foolish-sounding
civil
rights
act
for
it
to
read
that
your
employment
rights
are
enforceable
under
your
agreement
and
a
final
arbitrators
award
shall
represent
the
state
of
the
law
as
congress
sees
it.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
mr.
justice
because
the
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
because
here
the
key
is
the
consent
of
the
employee.
title
vii
gave
that
employee
a
right
to
sue
his
employer
and
there’s
no
question
about
that.
however,
he
is
the
possessor
of
that
right
as
the
possessor,
he
can
use
it
fully
by
filing
a
full
title
vii
class
and
in
visual
action
he
can
use
it
partially
as
alexander
did
by
filing
only
individual
action.
he
can
use
it
not
at
all
or
he
can
submit
it
to
another
form.
the
key
is
the
consent
of
the
employee.
mr.
robert
g.
good
he.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
agree,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
if
i
may
answer
that
in
two
ways
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
indeed
he
did.
we
view
that
differently
than
counsel
does.
here
is
man
who
presses
race,
the
racial
issue
before
the
arbitrator
and
at
the
same
time
simultaneously
invokes
the
state
procedures
under
the
statute.
when
he
thereafter
proceeds
to
press
the
arbitration
racial
issue,
he’s
indicating
one;
that
he
has
knowledge
of
his
statutory
rights
because
he’s
already
filed
under
the
state
and
two,
when
he
presses
that
issue,
he’s
indicating
his
selection
of
the
two
areas
or
the
two
remedies.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes
sir,
but
you
should
remember
here
he
had
access
to
the
state
civil
rights
agency
and
to
the
federal
civil
rights
agency
at
a
point
prior
to
his
submitting
the
racial
issue
to
the
arbitrator
and
surely
that
indicates
that
he
had
as
a
good
advice
is
available
anywhere
in
the
land
today.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i’m
sure
he
was
mr.
arbitrator.
mr.
robert
g.
good
he
was
knowledgeable
of
his
statutory
rights.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that
he
was
trying
to
get
both?
he
certainly
is
today,
he
still
trying
to
get
the
other
half.
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
because
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
we
must
–-
we
cannot
ignore
certain
statistics
that
prevailed
here.
as
stated
earlier,
there
are
160,000
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
the
united
states
covering
25
million
employees
94%
of
which
have
binding
arbitration
clauses
and
today
69%
of
those
agreements
have
nondiscrimination
clauses.
now,
alexander’s
case
is
only
in
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
fifth
circuit
in
rios
recommends
deferral
as
dewey.
however
and
i
presume
that
is
what
the
justice
is
talking
about
the
rios
versus
reynolds
metals
case.
there,
they
recommend
deferral
on
the
seventh
stringent
criteria.
we
recommend
what
we
call
a
liberal
deferral
policy.
we
find
the
rios
deferral
policy
unworkable
and
destructive
of
the
arbitration
process.
first,
under
the
rios
deferral
policy,
the
arbitration
has
to
compare
favorably,
substantially
and
procedurally
with
a
hearing
that
the
claimant
would
have
in
the
u.s.
district
court.
further,
the
u.s.
district
court
in
determining
whether
to
defer
has
to
hold
a
hearing
that
i
think
in
lengthy
complexity
is
greater
than
a
normal
title
vii
hearing.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
rios
decision
mr.
justice
is
only
about
five
or
six
months
old
and
so
i
can
not
answer
your
question.
we
do
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
that
act?
mr.
robert
g.
good
there
is
nothing.
the
act
is
totally
barren
of
any
reference
to
prior
arbitration
would.
i
submit
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
but
i
submit
mr.
justice
when
you
consider
the
statistics
i’ve
mentioned
most
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
they
had
to.
they
just
missed
the
whole
point
surely
with
those
tremendous
statistics
whether
they
were
to
permit
the
arbitration
to
stand
or
to
deny
enforcement.
they
would
have
said
one
way
or
the
other
with
this
totally
pervasive
structure
of
our
industrial
relations
staring
them
in
the
face.
they
just
missed
the
vote
and
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
make
reasonable
accommodation
between
these
conflicting
interests.
next,
mr.
justice
marshall
showed
some
concern
that
the
employee
is
participating
in
a
forum
where
the
scope
and
the
dimensions
of
the
hearing,
he
receives
is
something
different
and
what
he
would
receive
in
u.s.
district
court
and
this
is
surely
true.
however,
this
court
has
previously
acknowledged
that
those
differences
do
exist.
this
was
in
the
arguelles
case.
those
differences
do
exist
and
they
are
not
repugnant.
justice
harlan
in
bulk
carriers
stated
it
this
way,
“this
court
has
always
recognized
that
the
choice
of
forms
inevitably
affects
the
scope
of
the
substantive
rights
to
be
vindicated
before
the
chosen
forum.”
in
particular,
where
arbitration
is
concerned,
the
court
has
been
acutely
sensitive
to
these
differences
and
he
goes
on
further
at
a
later
point.
normally,
the
impact
on
the
substantive
rights
resulting
from
the
decision
to
remit
the
individual
to
the
arbitral
forum
is
acceptable
because
the
parties
themselves
have
consented
to
that
forum.”
again,
consent
the
key
here
is
consent.
the
employee
was
given
a
right
to
sue
his
employer.
he
is
possessor
of
that
right.
he
can
use
it
fully,
partially
not
use
it
at
all
or
submit
it
to
another
forum.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
union
filed
it.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
union
did.
mr.
robert
g.
good
our
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
was
by
his
choice
mr.
justice.
it
is
not
part
of
our
premise
or
i
should
say
part
of
our
premise
is
that
if
an
employee,
if
this
would
be
possible
or
required
by
the
union
and
the
employer
to
process
an
arbitration
claim
that
involved
the
title
vii
issue.
if
he
disavowed
that
at
any
point,
he
would
still
have
his
title
vii
yet
available
to
him
because
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
he
commence
the
state
procedures.
he
filed
the
title
vii
action
after
the
arbitration.
mr.
robert
g.
good
this
is
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
says
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
says
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
sir,
it
says
to
me
that,
“i,
alexander,
am
aware
that
i
have
these
alternate
remedies
but
i,
alexander,
choose
to
press
the
discrimination
claim
in
this
arbitral
forum
in
both.
mr.
robert
g.
good
when
he
proceeded
with
the
arbitration,
i
submit
he
made
the
selection
at
that
point.
he
showed
his
ability
to
keep
it,
to
withhold
it
from
arbitration.
he
showed
his
knowledge
of
the
statutory
proceedings.
nevertheless
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
he
had
already
filed
with
a
state
agency.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
sir.
he
filed
with
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
shortly
after
his
discharge
and
the
eeoc
assumed
jurisdiction
before
the
arbitration
also.
so,
both
agencies
had
taken
jurisdiction
prior
to
the
arbitration.
mr.
robert
g.
good
it
was
ascending
to
the
grievance
steps,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
now,
you
recall
though
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
he
says
so
a
year
later
after
he’s
lost
the
arbitration,
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
we
can’t
say
he
was
dissatisfied
at
the
point
of
the
arbitration
which
brings
me
to
another
point.
counsel
stated
that
we
ought
to
allow
the
arbitration
process
to
take
place
because
of
what
i
interpreted
he
was
saying
it’s
therapeutic
vial.
i
submit
to
you
that
it
has
a
lot
of
good
therapy
if
the
employee
wins
but
if
he
loses
it
exacerbates
his
feelings
of
resentment
and
we
have
a
title
vii
action
if
we
doubt
that,
just
look
at
all
the
cases
we
have
cited
in
this
various
briefs.
all
on
this
issue
and
guess
what
always
in
the
arbitration,
he
lost.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
indeed.
mr.
robert
g.
good
not
at
all
compared
to
maddox.
compared
with
maddox
where
the
court
said
thou
shalt
exercise
your
administrator
remedies.
that
was
on
the
contract
however.
here,
it
is
a
statute
with
an
overriding
public
interest
and
incidentally
in
making
the
assertion
that
he
can
not
be
forced
to
arbitration
we
not
only
relied
on
a
literal
words
of
section
706
that
says,
you
do
have
a
right
to
sue
your
employee.
we
rely
on
u.s.
bulk
carriers
versus
arguelles
as
i’ve
heard
it
pronounced
here
this
morning.
and
it’s
true
in
that
case
justice
harlan
did
say
that
the
least
satisfactory
of
all
solutions
is
the
necessity
of
suits
in
both
forms.
now,
my
opposition
points
out
that
or
they
suggest
that
the
1972
amendments
the
civil
rights
act
indicate
a
clear
congressional
intent
that
no
other
forum
was
to
substitute
for
a
title
vii
district
court
forum.
it
is
true
that
the
72
amendments
direct
the
eeoc
to
give
“substantial
way
to
final
orders
or
the
decisions
of
state
local
authorities.”
however,
we
use,
we
view
that
as
a
concern
of
congress
that
an
employee
who
congress
has
required
to
use
the
state
procedures,
they
are
concerned
that
an
employee
be
required
to
be
bound
by
state
procedures
which
contained
infirmities
or
potential
infirmities.
indeed,
senator
clark
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
expressed
exactly
that
concern.
he
stated
“state
and
local
fair
employment
laws
very
widely
in
effectiveness
in
many
areas
effective
enforcement
is
handed
by
inadequate
legislation,
inadequate
procedures,
or
an
inadequate
budget.”
and
you
will
recall
that
now
congress
requires
the
employee
to
first
use
those
procedures.
so
the
concern
of
the
congress
was
that
no
other
sovereign
or
law
or
procedure
require
the
employee
to
accept
less
than
his
full
day
in
court
under
title
vii
if
he
so
chose.
mr.
robert
g.
good
in
so
far
as
it
ruled
deferral
it
went
exactly
as
far
as
we
would
go.
insofar
as
it
defined
the
rules
for
the
district
court
under
which
deferral
was
proper,
it
went
much
too
far.
we
say
it’s
destructive
of
the
arbitration
process
and
unworkable.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
begin
to
argue
at
that
point
mr.
justice
and
the
subsequent
point,
i
believe
--
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
i
don’t
have
problem
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
that
one
and
none
of
the
remaining
ones,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
yes
insofar
as,
i’m
bothered
by
the
one
preceding
it.
that
is
the
evidence
presented
at
the
arbitral
hearing
dealt
adequately
with
all
the
factual
issues.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
problem.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
it
is.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
well,
not
only
with
the
arbitration
process
but
it
imposes
a
duty
on
the
lower
court
to
hold
a
hearing
that
is
its
magnitude
and
complexity
would
go
far
beyond
going
ahead
with
this
title
vii
trial
for
instance,
mr.
justice.
i
believe
you
called
it
the
third
one.
the
evidence
presented
at
the
arbitral
hearing
dealt
adequately
with
all
the
factual
issues.
well,
first
the
court
has
to
determine
what
were
all
the
factual
issues?
and
secondly,
what
would
be
the
factual
issues
if
we
had
a
title
vii
trial?
in
other
words,
did
the
arbitrator
know
all
the
issues?
mr.
robert
g.
good
would
you
repeat
that
mr.
justice,
please?
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
sir.
i
do
not
eliminate
two.
the
arbitrator
had
a
power
to
determine
the
issue.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no
problem.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
third
one.
mr.
robert
g.
good
the
evidence
presented
at
the
arbitral
hearing
dealt
adequately
with
all
the
factual
issues.
mr.
robert
g.
good
not
insofar
as
the
district
court
must
determine
that
but
we
all
know
from
trial
experience
even
in
a
pretrial
conference.
we
do
not
agree
on
what
all
the
factual
issues
are
and
its
sub-factual
issues
and
always
in
trial
of
the
issues
come
up.
the
judge
under
this
burden
of
rios
would
have
to
hold
a
hearing
that
would
certainly
be
lengthy,
it
would
be
a
retrial
of
the
arbitration
hearing
and
in
fact
the
district
court
would
have
to
substitute
in
many
instances
its
judgment.
mr.
robert
g.
good
if
he
went
in
under
section
301,
do
you
mean
mr.
justice?
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
no.
i
did
not
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes,
in
most
cases
whether
there
is
no
statute
involved
the
district
court
you
exercise
its
normal
function
to
determine
that
that
the
arbitrator
had
jurisdiction
and
where
the
proceedings
are
fair
and
regular.
mr.
robert
g.
good
we
had
one
thing
and
i
am
not
so
sure
if
they’re
listening
to
mr.
justice
white.
they
were
adding
that
one
thing.
they
were
at
least
underlining
it
and
that
is
that
the
court
must
examine
the
arbitrator’s
opinion
and
award
to
see
if
it
patently
offended
the
underlying
policies
of
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
robert
g.
good
whatever,
civil
rights
law.
mr.
robert
g.
good
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
good
this
is
correct
in
the
view
of
over
90%
of
the
arbitrators,
mr.
justice
white.
there
is
a
small
minority
who
disagree
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
g.
good
because
he
can
tell
on
the
face
of
the
arbitration
and
some
–-
well,
on
the
face
of
the
arbitration
he
can
tell
whether
it
patently
offensed
the
underlying
policies
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
g.
good
well,
except
to
the
extent
mr.
justice
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
mclean
case
which
was
shortly
after
rios
seem
to
agree
with
rios.
however,
in
the
mclean
the
court
predicated
that
decision
on
a
statement
that
they
read
into
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
“federal
policy
of
the
deferral.”
well,
that’s
very
presumptuous
reading
considering
the
case
we
are
right
here
that
i’m
talking
about.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
good
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
i
have
made
statement
i
did
is
that
i
attend
all
of
these
labor
law
conferences
and
there’s
always
a
isolated
arbitrator
who
gets
up
and
makes
the
statement
that
we’ve
all
heard
so
often,
i’m
merely
a
creature
of
the
parties
and
i
am
only
what
the
parties
make
me
and
if
they
tell
me
to
violate
the
law
and
–-
mr.
robert
g.
good
i’m
unaware
of
any
of
that
say
exactly
that.
i’m
aware
of
this
court’s
assumption
that
an
arbitrator
will
follow
the
law
especially
in
preemption
matters
for
the
problem.
one
item
mentioned
in
my
opponent’s
brief
and
which
i
think
bears
some
response,
the
alexander
appeals
that
sense
of
fairness
of
this
court
and
he
states
in
there
that
if
david
in
the
biblical
confrontation
with
goliath
had
two
stones
to
a
sling,
he
would
not
have
been
unfairly
on
for
that
confrontation
and
thus
by
analogy
says
alexander.
if
alexander
i.e.
david
has
two
cracks
at
my
client
i.e.
goliath,
there’s
nothing
wrong
with
that.
and
then
at
that
point
they
go
on
to
recite
six
different
statutory
procedures
now
available
for
an
employee
to
proceed
against
his
employer.
all
of
which
are
free,
none
of
which
are
exclusive
to
all
of
which
the
employer
must
respond
and
to
which
he
is
bound
in
the
event
of
an
adverse
determination
in
any
one
of
those
forums.
take
all
of
that,
add
to
it
the
fact
that
the
amendments
now
apply
the
act
to
a
business
having
as
few
as
15
employees
and
you
have
to
wonder,
who
in
the
world
is
david
and
who
is
goliath
in
this
industrial
civil
rights
confrontation.
mr.
john
pemberton,
deputy
general
counsel
of
the
eeoc,
former
deputy
general
counsel.
even
in
his
position
was
able
to
show
some
pity
for
the
employer
in
this
dilemma.
he
described
the
dilemma
as
follows:
“if
the
number
of
multiple
employee
remedies
is
not
awesome
enough,
the
lack
of
finality
in
any
decision
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
certainly
poses
a
defendant’s
nightmare.”
surely,
congress
in
defining
title
vii
did
not
intend
nightmare
of
litigation
for
anyone.
it
only
intended
to
create
of
very
powerful
tool
with
which
to
eliminate
employment
discrimination.
for
all
of
these
reasons
we
ask
the
court
to
adopt
a
policy
of
liberal
deferral
to
find
that
the
lower
court
did
conform
to
that
policy
and
to
affirm
for
those
reasons.
mr.
chief
justice,
absent
any
further
questions
i
submit
the
case
on
behalf
of
my
client
gardner-denver
company.
mr.
robert
g.
good
thank
you
sir.
