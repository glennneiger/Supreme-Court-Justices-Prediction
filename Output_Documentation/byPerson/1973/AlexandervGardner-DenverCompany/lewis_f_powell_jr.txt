justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
a
black
employee
was
discharged
by
the
respondent
company.
petitioner
claimed
racial
discrimination
and
through
his
union,
initiated
arbitration
proceedings
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
agreement
prohibited
racial
discrimination.
after
hearing,
the
arbitrator
ruled
that
petitioner's
discharge
was
for
a
cause.
the
petitioner
that
pursued
remedies
under
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
following
unfavorable
action
by
eeoc,
petitioner
instituted
this
suit
in
the
district
court.
that
court
granted
respondent's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
holding
that
petitioner
was
bound
by
the
prior
arbitral
decision.
the
question
presented
to
us
is
whether
under
title
7,
one
who
has
sought
relief
by
arbitration
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
who
has
lost,
may
nevertheless
obtain
a
de
novo
trial
for
the
discrimination
issue
in
a
federal
district
court.
we
hold
that
he
may.
that
the
statutory
right
to
such
a
trial
is
not
foreclosed
either
by
waiver
or
by
the
doctrine
of
election
of
remedies,
but
the
federal
court
may
admit
the
arbitral
decision
in
evidence
and
accord
to
it
such
weight
as
maybe
appropriate
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
is
reversed.
