mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
spring
of
1971
when
this
issue
was
before
the
court
in
dewey
against
reynolds
metals
company,
solicitor
general
griswold,
assistant
attorney
general
leonard
and
general
counsel
ed
baire
(ph)
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
filed
a
brief
and
the
government
participated
in
the
oral
argument
of
that
case
resulted
in
a
4:4
division
in
the
court.
that
involved
an
additional
troublesome
issue
not
present
in
this
case.
now,
with
new
encumbrance
at
all
three
of
those
offices,
the
government
undertook
a
complete
restudy
of
this
question
in
light
of
the
experience
gained
in
case
is
decided
since
that
time
and
in
light
of
the
scholarly
commentary
which
has
been
published
on
the
dewey
case.
practically,
all
that
i
must
--
i
should
add
critical
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
dewey
and
the
conclusions
we
have
reached
in
the
briefs
filed
with
the
court
in
the
present
case
are
the
same
in
all
respects
as
the
position,
the
government
took
in
the
dewey
case.
because
of
the
widespread
availability
of
grievance
procedures
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stewart
under
collective
bargaining
agreements,
the
question
presented
in
this
case
seems
to
us
of
great
public
interest.
its
answer
may
well
determine
whether
the
statutory
rights
against
discrimination
conferred
by
congress
in
title
vii
as
interpreted
by
the
courts
and
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
whether
those
rights
will
be
widely
observed
and
even
handedly
enforced
or
whether
those
rights
will
in
substantial
measure
be
superseded
by
the
so
called
law
of
the
shop
which
is
implemented
by
arbitrators
who
interpreted
and
applied
the
terms
of
various
private
collective
bargaining
agreements.
now,
the
position
we
take
on
this
issue
is
the
position
that
has
been
taken
by
a
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
it.
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
fifth,
seventh
and
ninth
circuits
have
all
held
that
the
invocation
of
the
arbitration
process
of
the
grievance
process
and
its
use
does
not
bar
suit
under
title
vii.
this
is
proved
to
be
workable
in
those
circuits.
they
are
not
inundated
with
a
large
number
of
lawsuits
seeking
in
other
form
to
re-litigate
so
called
the
questions
that
have
been
decided
in
the
arbitration
process.
indeed,
the
same
question
could
be
raised
about
some
of
the
duplications
of
remedies
that
congress
specifically
provided
for
title
vii,
where
it
said
that
the
remedies
available
again
to
millions
of
employees,
i
don’t
have
the
figures,
before
state
and
local
fair
employment
practices
commissions
should
be
preserved
but
should
not
bar
the
federal
remedy
if
they
prove
on
availing.
this
is
the
approach
that
congress
used
and
indeed
our
starting
point
in
this
case
is
the
federal
statute
itself
which
confers
of
right
of
individual
access
to
the
courts
for
its
enforcement
and
specifies
in
detail,
the
prerequisites
for
that
right
of
access.
nowhere
does
the
statute
suggest
that
the
right
to
a
judicial
determination
is
waived
by
the
availability
or
by
the
use
of
the
grievance
procedure
under
a
collective
agreement.
the
whole
background
of
the
legislative
history
was
that
congress
meant
to
preserve
existing
remedies
such
as
remedies
that
might
exist
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
were
specifically
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history
and
remedies
in
other
forms
and
to
add
to
those
the
newly
created
rights
and
remedies
specifically
provided
for.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
believe
it
makes
that
enforceable
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
respect
to
the
contract
issue
that
is
right,
your
honor.
all
the
arbitrator
decides
is
that
it
is
under
the
contract.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
the
most
troublesome
issue
and
we
concluded
that
it
should
not
have
any
significance
in
the
court
suit.
it
has
great
significance
in
the
arbitration
process,
it
ends
the
issue
under
the
agreement
except
for
the
very
limited
judicial
review
that
there
is
that
the
arbitration
award
and
therefore
it
ends
the
employers
dispute
with
the
union
protects
him
against
work
stoppages
that
hold
grievance
process
is
set
up
to
protect
them
against
and
this
is
the
great
value
of
the
arbitration
system
both
to
the
unions
and
the
employers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
the
title
vii
issue
because
congress
specify
another
way
of
determining
title
vii
claims,
statutory
claims
of
an
individual
that
don’t
threaten
works
stoppages
the
way
contract
claims
do.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct
but
that
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
disputes
of
that
kind
are
basically
disputes
between
the
workers
as
a
collectivity
the
union
that’s
representing
them
and
the
employer,
the
union
is
a
majoritarian
institution
and
is
like
the
employer
concerned
about
protecting
most
of
the
workers
in
the
shop
from
unnecessary
disruptions
of
the
work
process
and
these
disputes
are
closely
tied
in
with
the
law
of
the
shop
and
the
expertise
of
arbitrators.
here,
congress
decided
that
rights
of
individual
members
of
minority
groups
should
be
protected,
rights
that
have
proved
not
to
be
adequately
protected
in
the
majoritarian
processes
that
prevailed
in
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
in
the
adjustment
of
the
grievances.
indeed,
congress
had
to
specify
that
these
rights
would
be
available
against
the
unions
as
well
as
against
employers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
out
there
in
the
majority
in
the
country
but
not
in
the
workforce.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
very
much
to
be
and
it’s
rather
unlikely
that
their
rights
won’t
be
respected
in
the
situation
which
therein
--.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
if
a
member
of
one
of
these
groups
can
show
that
his
statutory
rights
were
violated.
congress
has
specified
that
he
should
have
a
remedy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
true
in
any
field
exactly.
it’s
true
with
respect
to
those
statutory
or
constitutional
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
a
simple
provision
in
the
contract
relating
to
discrimination
whether
that
is
coextensive
with
the
law
under
title
vii
is
highly
questionable
and
is
an
issue
which
the
arbitrator
had
no
occasion
to
address
and
which
ordinarily
the
arbitrator
has
no
occasion
to
address.
the
law
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
is.
as
a
matter
of
his
contract
rights
that
he’s
reinstated
as
a
matter
of
his
contract
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
depends
on
the
terms
of
the
collective
agreement
because
the
arbitrators
powers
are
drawn
entirely
from
the
collective
agreement
–-
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
the
questions
of
backpay
and
so
forth
that
might
be
available
under
title
vii
are
the
question
of
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
the
collective
agreement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
have
no
reason
to
think
it
would
in
this
case
but
one
could
not
know
until
the
arbitrator
expressed
himself
on
what
his
powers
are
under
the
agreement
and
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
the
normal
remedy,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
although,
we
take
the
position
that
double
recovery
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
would
not’have
any
damages.
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
reason
why
he
would
want
to
secure
an
injunction
which
he
has
a
right
too
under
the
statute
if
he
can
prove
that
he
is
entitled
to
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
might
be
a
different
measure
of
damages.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
of
the
grievance
procedure
of
arbitration,
no.
it
was
not
mentioned
under
the
legislative
history.
it
did,
there
was
reference
to
proceedings
that
may
be
available
under
the
railway
labor
act
or
the
national
labor
relations
act.
senator
clark
mentioned
on
the
floor
that
those
would
be
preserved
including
proceedings
before
the
national
labor
relation
board
and
we
do
refer
to
that
act,
sir
from
the
legislative
history.
here
we
can
deal
only
by
analogy
with
the
fact
that
the
statute
on
its
face
specifies
that
numerous
remedies
are
to
be
preserved
and
the
new
remedies
to
be
added
to
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
arguelles
is
very
persuasive
authority.
to
us,
this
case
is
in
many
respects
much
stronger
than
arguelles
because
here
congress
was
familiar
with
the
wide
use
of
arbitration.
it
is
not
true
when
the
arguelles
statute
was
passed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
encouragement
of
the
arbitration
process,
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
federal
labor
policy
to
put
a
premium
on
not
invoking
the
grievance
procedure
without
thinking
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
did.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
thought
so.
i
was
a
bit
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
arguelles
case
was
one
in
which
the
statutory
right
was
closely
interwoven
with
the
rights
under
the
contract
and
with
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
which
was
a
major
point
made
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
that
wasn’t
the
issue
decided
by
the
court.
on
the
other
hand
in
mckinney
against
missouri-kansas-texas
railroad
in
357
united
states,
when
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
writing
for
a
court
that
was
unanimous
on
this
issue.
with
respect
to
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act,
he
said
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
that
statute
to
insist
that
the
veteran
first
exhaust
all
their
possibly
lengthy
and
doubtful
procedures.
the
clear
implication
being
that
the
statutory
remedy
would
be
available
to
him
even
if
he
had
first
exhausted
the
other
remedies.
so
that
to
the
extent
of
majority
of
the
court
has
commented
on
this
issue,
i
think
a
majority
of
the
court
has
commented
consistently
with
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
think
there
is
in
this
case
either,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
know
the
answer
there,
i
don’t
believe
the
collective
agreement
is
recited
in
the
opinion
but
the
court
is
familiar
from
cases
like
griggs
and
mcdonell
douglas
with
the
great
complexity
of
the
law
under
title
vii
and
to
say
that
this
can
be
equated
with
the
single
sentence
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
will
be
applied
by
arbitrators
who
may
or
may
not
be
lawyers
with
representation
by
union
representatives
who
may
or
may
not
be
lawyers,
may
or
may
not
be
familiar
with
the
complexities
of
the
case
law
and
how
to
develop
one
of
these
cases
which
requires
usually
statistical
proof,
the
processes
of
discovery
and
the
various
other
court
procedures
that
make
such
proof
credible
and
meaningful
such
as
cross
examination,
etcetera.
i
think
it
would
be
doing
a
great
disservice
to
the
effectuation
of
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,

douglas

may
it
please
the
court.

the
union
that’s
representing
them
and
the
employer,
the
union
is
a
majoritarian
institution
and
is
like
the
employer
concerned
about
protecting
most
of
the
workers
in
the
shop
from
unnecessary
disruptions
of
the
work
process
and
these
disputes
are
closely
tied
in
with
the
law
of
the
shop
and
the
expertise
of
arbitrators.
here,
congress
decided
that
rights
of
individual
members
of
minority
groups
should
be
protected,
rights
that
have
proved
not
to
be
adequately
protected
in
the
majoritarian
processes
that
prevailed
in
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
in
the
adjustment
of
the
grievances.
indeed,
congress
had
to
specify
that
these
rights
would
be
available
against
the
unions
as
well
as
against
employers.
mr.

out
there
in
the
majority
in
the
country
but
not
in
the
workforce.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
very
much
to
be
and
it’s
rather
unlikely
that
their
rights
won’t
be
respected
in
the
situation
which
therein
--.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
if
a
member
of
one
of
these
groups
can
show
that
his
statutory
rights
were
violated.
congress
has
specified
that
he
should
have
a
remedy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
true
in
any
field
exactly.
it’s
true
with
respect
to
those
statutory
or
constitutional
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
a
simple
provision
in
the
contract
relating
to
discrimination
whether
that
is
coextensive
with
the
law
under
title
vii
is
highly
questionable
and
is
an
issue
which
the
arbitrator
had
no
occasion
to
address
and
which
ordinarily
the
arbitrator
has
no
occasion
to
address.
the
law
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
is.
as
a
matter
of
his
contract
rights
that
he’s
reinstated
as
a
matter
of
his
contract
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
depends
on
the
terms
of
the
collective
agreement
because
the
arbitrators
powers
are
drawn
entirely
from
the
collective
agreement
–-
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
the
questions
of
backpay
and
so
forth
that
might
be
available
under
title
vii
are
the
question
of
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
the
collective
agreement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
have
no
reason
to
think
it
would
in
this
case
but
one
could
not
know
until
the
arbitrator
expressed
himself
on
what
his
powers
are
under
the
agreement
and
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
the
normal
remedy,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
although,
we
take
the
position
that
double
recovery
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
would
not’have
any
damages.
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
reason
why
he
would
want
to
secure
an
injunction
which
he
has
a
right
too
under
the
statute
if
he
can
prove
that
he
is
entitled
to
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
might
be
a
different
measure
of
damages.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
of
the
grievance
procedure
of
arbitration,
no.
it
was
not
mentioned
under
the
legislative
history.
it
did,
there
was
reference
to
proceedings
that
may
be
available
under
the
railway
labor
act
or
the
national
labor
relations
act.
senator
clark
mentioned
on
the
floor
that
those
would
be
preserved
including
proceedings
before
the
national
labor
relation
board
and
we
do
refer
to
that
act,
sir
from
the
legislative
history.
here
we
can
deal
only
by
analogy
with
the
fact
that
the
statute
on
its
face
specifies
that
numerous
remedies
are
to
be
preserved
and
the
new
remedies
to
be
added
to
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
arguelles
is
very
persuasive
authority.
to
us,
this
case
is
in
many
respects
much
stronger
than
arguelles
because
here
congress
was
familiar
with
the
wide
use
of
arbitration.
it
is
not
true
when
the
arguelles
statute
was
passed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
encouragement
of
the
arbitration
process,
that
is
an
important
part
of
the
federal
labor
policy
to
put
a
premium
on
not
invoking
the
grievance
procedure
without
thinking
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
he
did.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
thought
so.
i
was
a
bit
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
arguelles
case
was
one
in
which
the
statutory
right
was
closely
interwoven
with
the
rights
under
the
contract
and
with
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
which
was
a
major
point
made
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
now,
that
wasn’t
the
issue
decided
by
the
court.
on
the
other
hand
in
mckinney
against
missouri-kansas-texas
railroad
in
357
united
states,
when
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
writing
for
a
court
that
was
unanimous
on
this
issue.
with
respect
to
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act,
he
said
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
that
statute
to
insist
that
the
veteran
first
exhaust
all
their
possibly
lengthy
and
doubtful
procedures.
the
clear
implication
being
that
the
statutory
remedy
would
be
available
to
him
even
if
he
had
first
exhausted
the
other
remedies.
so
that
to
the
extent
of
majority
of
the
court
has
commented
on
this
issue,
i
think
a
majority
of
the
court
has
commented
consistently
with
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
think
there
is
in
this
case
either,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
know
the
answer
there,
i
don’t
believe
the
collective
agreement
is
recited
in
the
opinion
but
the
court
is
familiar
from
cases
like
griggs
and
mcdonell
douglas
with
the
great
complexity
of
the
law
under
title
vii
and
to
say
that
this
can
be
equated
with
the
single
sentence
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
will
be
applied
by
arbitrators
who
may
or
may
not
be
lawyers
with
representation
by
union
representatives
who
may
or
may
not
be
lawyers,
may
or
may
not
be
familiar
with
the
complexities
of
the
case
law
and
how
to
develop
one
of
these
cases
which
requires
usually
statistical
proof,
the
processes
of
discovery
and
the
various
other
court
procedures
that
make
such
proof
credible
and
meaningful
such
as
cross
examination,
etcetera.
i
think
it
would
be
doing
a
great
disservice
to
the
effectuation
of
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
my
time
has
expired.
