unknown
speaker
mr.
spiegelman,
i
don’t
want
to
anticipate
your
argument
but
is
it
going
to
be
an
issue
here
whether
in
fact
the
usual
racial
discrimination
was
decided
by
the
arbitrator?
unknown
speaker
was
not?
perhaps,
i
am
under
a
misapprehension
that
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
did
find
that
the
issue
was
raised
before
--
unknown
speaker
and
you
questioned
that
finding?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
a
year
later?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
the
arbitrator’s
opinion,
that
was
the
law
school
team,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
it
makes
no
reference
that
the
grievance
involved
racial
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
did
he
testify
later
at
all?
unknown
speaker
no.
did
the
arbitrator
testify
anywhere
as
to
this?
unknown
speaker
and
had
he
in
the
fact
before
the
arbitration
hearing
referred
this
discrimination
claim
to
the
colorado
city
commission?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
got
the
idea
that
--
what
was
the
basis
for
its
first
finding
i’m
now
reading
from
its
opinion,
the
issue
of
racially
motivated
discriminatory
employment
practices
was
presented
to
the
arbitrator
and
rejected?
unknown
speaker
but
surely
you
can
see
that
the
arbitrator
did
find
that
the
discharged
was
for
just
cause,
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
now,
wouldn’t
that
mean
that
he
did
find
that
it
wasn’t
by
reason
of
racial
discrimination
because
that
was
a
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
you
told
us.
unknown
speaker
well
not,
there
could
not
have
been
just
cause
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
provides
that
there
cannot
be
any
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
if
they
were
racial
discrimination,
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
issue
in
that
case
i
gather
go,
perhaps
considerably
beyond
the
specific
facts
of
this
particular
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
a
racial
case
and
part
of
the
argument,
which
i
think
you
are
about
to
make
it
and
it
is
made
in
your
brief
is
confined
to
a
racial
situation
sure,
the
principle
that
you
espousing
can
not
be
confined
to
racial
discrimination,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
it
also
includes
discrimination
based
on
sex,
for
example
and
i
suppose
that
--
well,
how
many
are
there
25
million
employees
in
the
united
states
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreement
something
like
that?
over
a
90%
of
them
have
arbitration
provisions
of
the
grievance?
unknown
speaker
and
over
half
of
the
grievances
have
to
do
with
this
discharge,
is
that
right?
i
remember
i
read
that
somewhere
in
the
brief
and
i
suppose,
most
if
not
all
employees
are
either
men
or
women,
aren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
and
so
wouldn’t
any
employee
who
was
discharged
have
a
discrimination
claim
that
he
was
discharged
because
he
was
man
or
that
she
was
discharged
because
she
was
woman?
unknown
speaker
she
was
discharged
because
she
was
a
woman.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
we
are
talking
at
least
potentially
not
about
just
a
little
bit
of
added
burden
on
the
courts,
we
are
talking
about
tremendous
dual
trial
of
these
things,
aren’t
we?
unknown
speaker
well?
unknown
speaker
they
would
be
prior
to
arbitration
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
option
is
to
be
left
to
exclusively
with
the
employee
then
whether
he
will
have
another
bite
of
the
apple?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
going
to
deal
at
all
or
as
a
government
counsel
with
the
question
of,
if
you’re
right
on
your
basic
concept
of
an
arbitration
does
not
wholly
bar
a
lawsuit
under
the
federal
statute?
what
effect
if
any,
should
a
court
give
to
an
arbitration
award?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
federal
statute
makes
unenforceable
the
promise
to
arbitrate
the
grievance
involving
a
racial
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
the
employer
if
he
is
sued
in
court,
do
you
think
the
employer
can
--
even
he
has
to
go
for
the
court
suit
can
get
an
order
to
arbitrate
the
claim?
unknown
speaker
if
the
arbitrator
decides
on
facts,
some
facts
such
as
he
was
not
fired
because
of
the
negro
but
because
he
had
too
much
scrap,
has
that
any
significance
at
all
in
the
court
suit?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
the
contract
is
enforceable
with
premise
to
arbitrator
is
enforceable
but
it
is
just
say,
it
doesn’t
have
any
significance
if
the
employee
wants
to
pursue
his
legal
remedies
in
court.
it
does
not
have
any
significance
for
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
you
think
that
that
was
--
you
apparently
think
that
the
court
should
take
a
different
approach
where
a
contract
provides
for
arbitrating
racial
claims
and
where
a
contract
provides
for
arbitrating
disputes
that
might
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
even
though
congress
has
provided
another
way
also
of
settling
unfair
labor
practices?
unknown
speaker
the
court
certainly
will
not
entertain
arbitrable
disputes
where
there
might
be
unfair
labor
practice
if
there
is
a
promise
to
arbitrary.
unknown
speaker
not
only
for
minority
groups
that
includes
discrimination.
as
i
said
earlier
on
the
basis
of
sex
and
surely
one
sex
or
the
other
must
be
in
majority
in
this
county.
i
think
it’s
the
women,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
in
an
objective
plan
they
might
be
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
demands
might
not
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
doesn’t
need
to
show,
he
just
needs
to
in
order
to
file
a
complaint,
he
merely
needs
to
allege,
doesn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
mr.
wallace,
the
government’s
position
must
be
that
even
if
he
prevailed
on
a
claim
of
a
racial
discrimination
in
arbitration,
he
would
still
have
right
to
pursue
his
title
vii
in
the
claims
of
court?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
but
he
would
still
be
permitted
to
pursue
a
statutory
remedy?
unknown
speaker
remedy
for
what,
excuse
me?
i
beg
your
pardon?
he
would
not
have
any
damages
--
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
there
might
be
different
measure
of
damages?
unknown
speaker
it’s
definitely
mr.
wallace.
did
the
legislative
history,
i
don’t
notice
in
your
brief
any
reference
to
this;
address
itself
particularly
to
the
question?
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
does
arguelles
decide
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
arguelles.
in
arguelles,
he
went
directly
in
the
court.
he
hadn’t
gone
to
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
itself
realizes
of
that
scene.
the
arguelles
made
a
substantial
difference.
he
said
that
--
the
court
indicated
that
he
could
go
to
arbitration
if
he
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
didn’t
mr.
justice
harlan
make
this
difficult
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
and
he
specifically
said
that
he
has
a
choice
but
and
he
said
at
least
desirable
would
be
permitting
or
requiring
pursuit
in
both
courts?
unknown
speaker
and
arguelles
might
be
a
very
substantial
authority
for
deciding
this
case
against
your
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
not
quite
responsive
to
the
issue
because
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
take,
would
have
come
out
quite
the
other
way
if
there
have
been
a
result
to
arbitration
in
the
time
at
laws?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
mckinney
was
there
a
clause
in
the
contract
which
basically
gave
him
the
same
rights
as
the
veterans
preference
act
here?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
negative
implication
that
you’re
saying
no.
the
answer
to
my
question
is
no?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
was
there
any
reference
in
either
of
the
state
proceedings?
i
gather
the
company
was
party
of
course
both
for
the
state
proceedings
and
the
eeoc
procedure?
unknown
speaker
when
in
either
that
the
company
make
reference
to
the
dependency
of
the
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
and
was
the
eeoc
determination
of
no
probable
cause
made
in
the
light
of
that
submission?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
his
position
is
that
if
it
all
were
--
it
could
have
been
there
expressly
and
if
had
been
decided
against
him
nevertheless,
he
still
has
a
statutory
claim.
that’s
basically
his
position.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that’s
the
one
that
you
have
to
address,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
the
position
he
has
to
take
it.
unknown
speaker
this
does
mean
that
in
each
instance
under
your
submission
the
district
court
has
the
duty
to
make
that
much
of
a
review?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
at
all
say
that
the
fact
of
arbitration
bars
access
to
the
federal
court
over
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
the
duty
to
give
at
least
that
much
of
a
review?
unknown
speaker
and
if
court
finds
that
none
of
those
conditions
were
met
then
i
gather
--
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
it’s
the
court
duty
then
to
proceed
to
consider
the
claim
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
good,
at
the
appendix,
page
42
where
judge
winner’s
opinion
is
found,
where
he
is
quoting
from
the
dewey
language,
it
seems
to
where
he
says
the
paragraph
beginning
with
“faced
with
this
dichotomy
of
authority”
the
second
sentence
“we
hold
that
when
an
employee
voluntarily
submits
a
claim
of
discrimination
to
arbitration
under
a
union
contract
grievance
procedure,
the
submission
which
is
binding
on
the
employer
no
matter
what,
the
employee
is
bound
by
the
arbitration
or
just
the
employer.”
i
think
it
would
be
fairly
easy
to
read
that
as
indicating
that
judge
winner
at
least
had
not
reviewed
the
arbitration
award
at
all
but
it
simply
treated
himself
as
being
bound
by
rather
categorically
which
sounds
inconsistent
of
what
you
said
the
district
court
should
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
exactly
how
i
read
it
but
i
thought
you
were
conceding
that
something
more
was
required
at
the
district
court
not
merely
a
voluntary
submission
but
that
the
district
court
should
in
effect
review
and
kind
of
clearly
erroneous
or
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
basis
the
arbitrators.
unknown
speaker
i
understood
you
to
respond
at
mr.
justice
stewart
that
a
district
court
had
a
duty
to
examine
the
arbitrator’s
process
to
see
at
least
with
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination
had
been
treated,
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
difference
between
that?
unknown
speaker
and
was
decided
that’s
all?
unknown
speaker
not
whether
it
was
properly
decided
but
whether
it
was
before
the
arbitrator
and
was
it
decided,
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
that's
just
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that
has
confused
me.
i
just
don’t
understand,
what
would
view
then
to
determine
that
is
made
by
the
--
of
the
arbitrators
award
is
made
by
the
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
what
does
he
do?
what’s
his
review?
what
standard
does
he
apply
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
award
offends
the
underlying
public
policy
of
the
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
there
isn’t
any
difference,
is
it?
then
in
the
case
of
the
other
arbitrations
and
arbitrator
is
not
suppose
to
decide
the
case
before
in
contrary
to
the
labor
act
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
consistent
with
the
law
then
if
a
complaint
comes
in
and
alleges
that
the
arbitrator
is
disregarding
provision
of
the
labor
law,
he
can
get
some
review,
can’t
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
--
if
somebody
sues
in
court
to
enforce
some
arbitrational
hearing
and
the
enforcement
is
resisted
on
the
grounds
the
arbitrator
acted
illegally,
is
the
district
court
going
to
order
compliance
without
answering
that
question?
i
just
wonder
if
you’re
really
saying
that
an
arbitration
award
in
this
context
is
subject
to
any
different
review
than
it
is
anywhere
else,
and
i
don’t
know
why
you
would
say
that.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that’s
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
title
vii
gives
this
petitioner
nothing
because
he
could
have
that
sort
a
review
of
the
arbitration
award
with
out
the
benefit
of
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
only
statutory
right?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
as
long
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
fifth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
good,
i
just
had
chance
to
look
at
rios.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
earlier
that,
this
went
too
far
or
didn’t
go
far
enough,
the
procedure
that
it
is
--
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently,
it
says
first,
the
contract
right
must
coincide
with
the
statutory
right.
unknown
speaker
and
second,
it
must
be
plain
that
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator,
in
no
way
violates
the
private
rights
guaranteed
by
title
vii
or
the
public
policy
which
adheres
to
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
in
addition,
must
be
satisfied
one,
the
factual
issues
are
identical
to
those
decided
by
the
arbitrator,
right?
unknown
speaker
the
arbitrator
–
second,
the
arbitrator
power
in
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
decide
the
issue
of
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
third,
the
evidence
presented
the
arbitrator
hearing
dealt
adequately
with
all
factual
issues?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
trouble
with
that?
unknown
speaker
the
arbitrator
actually
decided
the
factual
issues
presented
in
the
court,
does
that
bother
you?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
fifth
one,
the
arbitration
proceedings
is
fair
and
regular
and
free
of
procedural
infirmities??
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
really
the
second,
third
and
fourth?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
give
-–
they
interfered
too
much
with
the
arbitration
process?
unknown
speaker
so
actually
when
you
come
down
to
as
far
as
the
district
court
should
go,
it
would
be
to
determine
that
the
factual
issues
before
either
identical
to
those
decided
by
the
arbitrator?
number
one,
and
that
the
arbitration
proceeding
was
fair
and
regular
free
of
procedural
infirmities?
unknown
speaker
the
first
is,
the
factual
issues
before
it,
that
is
the
court
are
identical
to
those
decided
by
the
arbitrator?
i
thought
you
said
you
go
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well
all
right,
that
eliminates
one,
two,
three
and
four.
unknown
speaker
that
the
court
can
look
to.
how
about
five,
the
arbitration
proceeding
is
fair
and
regular
and
free
of
procedural
infirmities?
unknown
speaker
so,
just
those
two
and
you
think
to
the
extent?
unknown
speaker
which
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
good,
under
your
theory
of
deferral,
if
the
employer
could
come
in
on
an
action
to
set
aside
the
arbitration
award
assuming
it
had
gone
in
favor
of
the
employee
and
make
the
same
sort
of
showing
that
you’re
talking
about
an
employee
making
under
title
vii
action,
would
the
employer
then
be
entitled
to
have
the
arbitration
award
set
aside
on
a
proceeding
directed
to
that
end?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
whatever
section
you
go
in
to
have
an
arbitration
award
set
aside?
or
say
you’re
opposing
a
judicial
action
to
confirm
the
award
or
enforce
the
award?
unknown
speaker
you’re
talking
about
the
showing
that
must
be
made
by
an
employee
in
a
title
vii
case
that
the
type
of
procedure
that
district
court
should
follow
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
defer
to
the
arbitration
award.
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
in
a
case
not
involving
discrimination
an
employee
brings
action
to
enforce
an
arbitration
award
in
his
favor,
is
the
standard
that
the
district
court
is
to
employ
there
any
different
in
a
kind
of
standard
you’re
talking
about
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
is
this
basically
the
same
thing
or
is
it
something
added
because
of
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
arbitrator
may
not
just
disregard
this
applicable
substantive
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes
whatever
the
applicable
laws
are
in
the
areas?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
good
this
sounds
like
what
was
said
in
rios,
second,
it
must
be
plain
that
the
arbitrator’s
decision
is
no
way
violative
of
the
private
rights
guaranteed
by
title
vii
nor
the
public
policy
which
adheres
in
title
vii,
didn’t
you
say
to
me
earlier
that
you
agreed
with
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
do,
why
doesn’t
a
judge,
the
district
judge
to
be
satisfied
of
this
have
to
go
through
it
as
extensive
hearing
as
concerns
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
thus
far
the
fifth
circuit
stands
alone
and
its
enunciation
standards,
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
are
there
some
–-
are
there
some
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
or
this
court
that
indicates
that
an
arbitrator
is
not
bound
but
made
it
by
a
relevant
provision
of
the
substantive
law?
unknown
speaker
and
may
disregard
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know,
are
there
some
cases
then
to
say
that
the
arbitrator
is
bound
by
a
substantive?
let’s
assume
for
example
in
this
case
the
arbitrator
decided
there
was
no
racial
discrimination
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
title
vii,
whereas
a
decision
of
this
court
had
construed
the
title
vii
to
bar
precise
to
the
conduct
that
was
the
issue
before
the
arbitrator.
now,
is
there
some
case
that
says
the
arbitrator
must
follow
them
all?
unknown
speaker
i
thought,
you
told
us
earlier
counsel
about
how
difficult
it
was
to
get
a
lawyer
in
a
case
like
this.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
only
in
title
vii
cases
or
what?
unknown
speaker
only?
would
you
think
of
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
really
that
if
the
arbitration
machinery
is
only
enforceable
by
one
side
of
the
contract,
eventually
the
employer
would
ever
be
forced
to
go
to
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
no,
if
your
advise
your
clients
may
be
futile
if
the
employers
are
bound
to
go
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
mr.
spiegelman,
i
don’t
want
to
anticipate
your
argument
but
is
it
going
to
be
an
issue
here
whether
in
fact
the
usual
racial
discrimination
was
decided
by
the
arbitrator?
unknown
speaker
was
not?
perhaps,
i
am
under
a
misapprehension
that
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
did
find
that
the
issue
was
raised
before
--
unknown
speaker
and
you
questioned
that
finding?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
a
year
later?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
the
arbitrator’s
opinion,
that
was
the
law
school
team,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
it
makes
no
reference
that
the
grievance
involved
racial
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
did
he
testify
later
at
all?
unknown
speaker
no.
did
the
arbitrator
testify
anywhere
as
to
this?
unknown
speaker
and
had
he
in
the
fact
before
the
arbitration
hearing
referred
this
discrimination
claim
to
the
colorado
city
commission?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
got
the
idea
that
--
what
was
the
basis
for
its
first
finding
i’m
now
reading
from
its
opinion,
the
issue
of
racially
motivated
discriminatory
employment
practices
was
presented
to
the
arbitrator
and
rejected?
unknown
speaker
but
surely
you
can
see
that
the
arbitrator
did
find
that
the
discharged
was
for
just
cause,
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
now,
wouldn’t
that
mean
that
he
did
find
that
it
wasn’t
by
reason
of
racial
discrimination
because
that
was
a
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
you
told
us.
unknown
speaker
well
not,
there
could
not
have
been
just
cause
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
provides
that
there
cannot
be
any
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
if
they
were
racial
discrimination,
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
issue
in
that
case
i
gather
go,
perhaps
considerably
beyond
the
specific
facts
of
this
particular
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
a
racial
case
and
part
of
the
argument,
which
i
think
you
are
about
to
make
it
and
it
is
made
in
your
brief
is
confined
to
a
racial
situation
sure,
the
principle
that
you
espousing
can
not
be
confined
to
racial
discrimination,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
it
also
includes
discrimination
based
on
sex,
for
example
and
i
suppose
that
--
well,
how
many
are
there
25
million
employees
in
the
united
states
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreement
something
like
that?
over
a
90%
of
them
have
arbitration
provisions
of
the
grievance?
unknown
speaker
and
over
half
of
the
grievances
have
to
do
with
this
discharge,
is
that
right?
i
remember
i
read
that
somewhere
in
the
brief
and
i
suppose,
most
if
not
all
employees
are
either
men
or
women,
aren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
and
so
wouldn’t
any
employee
who
was
discharged
have
a
discrimination
claim
that
he
was
discharged
because
he
was
man
or
that
she
was
discharged
because
she
was
woman?
unknown
speaker
she
was
discharged
because
she
was
a
woman.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
we
are
talking
at
least
potentially
not
about
just
a
little
bit
of
added
burden
on
the
courts,
we
are
talking
about
tremendous
dual
trial
of
these
things,
aren’t
we?
unknown
speaker
well?
unknown
speaker
they
would
be
prior
to
arbitration
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
option
is
to
be
left
to
exclusively
with
the
employee
then
whether
he
will
have
another
bite
of
the
apple?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
going
to
deal
at
all
or
as
a
government
counsel
with
the
question
of,
if
you’re
right
on
your
basic
concept
of
an
arbitration
does
not
wholly
bar
a
lawsuit
under
the
federal
statute?
what
effect
if
any,
should
a
court
give
to
an
arbitration
award?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
federal
statute
makes
unenforceable
the
promise
to
arbitrate
the
grievance
involving
a
racial
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
the
employer
if
he
is
sued
in
court,
do
you
think
the
employer
can
--
even
he
has
to
go
for
the
court
suit
can
get
an
order
to
arbitrate
the
claim?
unknown
speaker
if
the
arbitrator
decides
on
facts,
some
facts
such
as
he
was
not
fired
because
of
the
negro
but
because
he
had
too
much
scrap,
has
that
any
significance
at
all
in
the
court
suit?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
the
contract
is
enforceable
with
premise
to
arbitrator
is
enforceable
but
it
is
just
say,
it
doesn’t
have
any
significance
if
the
employee
wants
to
pursue
his
legal
remedies
in
court.
it
does
not
have
any
significance
for
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
you
think
that
that
was
--
you
apparently
think
that
the
court
should
take
a
different
approach
where
a
contract
provides
for
arbitrating
racial
claims
and
where
a
contract
provides
for
arbitrating
disputes
that
might
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
even
though
congress
has
provided
another
way
also
of
settling
unfair
labor
practices?
unknown
speaker
the
court
certainly
will
not
entertain
arbitrable
disputes
where
there
might
be
unfair
labor
practice
if
there
is
a
promise
to
arbitrary.
unknown
speaker
not
only
for
minority
groups
that
includes
discrimination.
as
i
said
earlier
on
the
basis
of
sex
and
surely
one
sex
or
the
other
must
be
in
majority
in
this
county.
i
think
it’s
the
women,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
in
an
objective
plan
they
might
be
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
demands
might
not
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
doesn’t
need
to
show,
he
just
needs
to
in
order
to
file
a
complaint,
he
merely
needs
to
allege,
doesn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
mr.
wallace,
the
government’s
position
must
be
that
even
if
he
prevailed
on
a
claim
of
a
racial
discrimination
in
arbitration,
he
would
still
have
right
to
pursue
his
title
vii
in
the
claims
of
court?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
but
he
would
still
be
permitted
to
pursue
a
statutory
remedy?
unknown
speaker
remedy
for
what,
excuse
me?
i
beg
your
pardon?
he
would
not
have
any
damages
--
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
there
might
be
different
measure
of
damages?
unknown
speaker
it’s
definitely
mr.
wallace.
did
the
legislative
history,
i
don’t
notice
in
your
brief
any
reference
to
this;
address
itself
particularly
to
the
question?
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
does
arguelles
decide
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
arguelles.
in
arguelles,
he
went
directly
in
the
court.
he
hadn’t
gone
to
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
itself
realizes
of
that
scene.
the
arguelles
made
a
substantial
difference.
he
said
that
--
the
court
indicated
that
he
could
go
to
arbitration
if
he
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
didn’t
mr.
justice
harlan
make
this
difficult
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
and
he
specifically
said
that
he
has
a
choice
but
and
he
said
at
least
desirable
would
be
permitting
or
requiring
pursuit
in
both
courts?
unknown
speaker
and
arguelles
might
be
a
very
substantial
authority
for
deciding
this
case
against
your
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
not
quite
responsive
to
the
issue
because
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
take,
would
have
come
out
quite
the
other
way
if
there
have
been
a
result
to
arbitration
in
the
time
at
laws?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
mckinney
was
there
a
clause
in
the
contract
which
basically
gave
him
the
same
rights
as
the
veterans
preference
act
here?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
negative
implication
that
you’re
saying
no.
the
answer
to
my
question
is
no?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
was
there
any
reference
in
either
of
the
state
proceedings?
i
gather
the
company
was
party
of
course
both
for
the
state
proceedings
and
the
eeoc
procedure?
unknown
speaker
when
in
either
that
the
company
make
reference
to
the
dependency
of
the
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
and
was
the
eeoc
determination
of
no
probable
cause
made
in
the
light
of
that
submission?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
his
position
is
that
if
it
all
were
--
it
could
have
been
there
expressly
and
if
had
been
decided
against
him
nevertheless,
he
still
has
a
statutory
claim.
that’s
basically
his
position.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that’s
the
one
that
you
have
to
address,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
the
position
he
has
to
take
it.
unknown
speaker
this
does
mean
that
in
each
instance
under
your
submission
the
district
court
has
the
duty
to
make
that
much
of
a
review?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
at
all
say
that
the
fact
of
arbitration
bars
access
to
the
federal
court
over
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
the
duty
to
give
at
least
that
much
of
a
review?
unknown
speaker
and
if
court
finds
that
none
of
those
conditions
were
met
then
i
gather
--
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
that
it’s
the
court
duty
then
to
proceed
to
consider
the
claim
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
good,
at
the
appendix,
page
42
where
judge
winner’s
opinion
is
found,
where
he
is
quoting
from
the
dewey
language,
it
seems
to
where
he
says
the
paragraph
beginning
with
“faced
with
this
dichotomy
of
authority”
the
second
sentence
“we
hold
that
when
an
employee
voluntarily
submits
a
claim
of
discrimination
to
arbitration
under
a
union
contract
grievance
procedure,
the
submission
which
is
binding
on
the
employer
no
matter
what,
the
employee
is
bound
by
the
arbitration
or
just
the
employer.”
i
think
it
would
be
fairly
easy
to
read
that
as
indicating
that
judge
winner
at
least
had
not
reviewed
the
arbitration
award
at
all
but
it
simply
treated
himself
as
being
bound
by
rather
categorically
which
sounds
inconsistent
of
what
you
said
the
district
court
should
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
exactly
how
i
read
it
but
i
thought
you
were
conceding
that
something
more
was
required
at
the
district
court
not
merely
a
voluntary
submission
but
that
the
district
court
should
in
effect
review
and
kind
of
clearly
erroneous
or
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
basis
the
arbitrators.
unknown
speaker
i
understood
you
to
respond
at
mr.
justice
stewart
that
a
district
court
had
a
duty
to
examine
the
arbitrator’s
process
to
see
at
least
with
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination
had
been
treated,
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
difference
between
that?
unknown
speaker
and
was
decided
that’s
all?
unknown
speaker
not
whether
it
was
properly
decided
but
whether
it
was
before
the
arbitrator
and
was
it
decided,
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
that's
just
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that
has
confused
me.
i
just
don’t
understand,
what
would
view
then
to
determine
that
is
made
by
the
--
of
the
arbitrators
award
is
made
by
the
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
what
does
he
do?
what’s
his
review?
what
standard
does
he
apply
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
award
offends
the
underlying
public
policy
of
the
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
there
isn’t
any
difference,
is
it?
then
in
the
case
of
the
other
arbitrations
and
arbitrator
is
not
suppose
to
decide
the
case
before
in
contrary
to
the
labor
act
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
consistent
with
the
law
then
if
a
complaint
comes
in
and
alleges
that
the
arbitrator
is
disregarding
provision
of
the
labor
law,
he
can
get
some
review,
can’t
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
--
if
somebody
sues
in
court
to
enforce
some
arbitrational
hearing
and
the
enforcement
is
resisted
on
the
grounds
the
arbitrator
acted
illegally,
is
the
district
court
going
to
order
compliance
without
answering
that
question?
i
just
wonder
if
you’re
really
saying
that
an
arbitration
award
in
this
context
is
subject
to
any
different
review
than
it
is
anywhere
else,
and
i
don’t
know
why
you
would
say
that.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that’s
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
title
vii
gives
this
petitioner
nothing
because
he
could
have
that
sort
a
review
of
the
arbitration
award
with
out
the
benefit
of
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
only
statutory
right?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
as
long
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
fifth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
good,
i
just
had
chance
to
look
at
rios.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
earlier
that,
this
went
too
far
or
didn’t
go
far
enough,
the
procedure
that
it
is
--
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently,
it
says
first,
the
contract
right
must
coincide
with
the
statutory
right.
unknown
speaker
and
second,
it
must
be
plain
that
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator,
in
no
way
violates
the
private
rights
guaranteed
by
title
vii
or
the
public
policy
which
adheres
to
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
in
addition,
must
be
satisfied
one,
the
factual
issues
are
identical
to
those
decided
by
the
arbitrator,
right?
unknown
speaker
the
arbitrator
–
second,
the
arbitrator
power
in
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
decide
the
issue
of
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
third,
the
evidence
presented
the
arbitrator
hearing
dealt
adequately
with
all
factual
issues?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
trouble
with
that?
unknown
speaker
the
arbitrator
actually
decided
the
factual
issues
presented
in
the
court,
does
that
bother
you?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
fifth
one,
the
arbitration
proceedings
is
fair
and
regular
and
free
of
procedural
infirmities??
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
really
the
second,
third
and
fourth?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
give
-–
they
interfered
too
much
with
the
arbitration
process?
unknown
speaker
so
actually
when
you
come
down
to
as
far
as
the
district
court
should
go,
it
would
be
to
determine
that
the
factual
issues
before
either
identical
to
those
decided
by
the
arbitrator?
number
one,
and
that
the
arbitration
proceeding
was
fair
and
regular
free
of
procedural
infirmities?
unknown
speaker
the
first
is,
the
factual
issues
before
it,
that
is
the
court
are
identical
to
those
decided
by
the
arbitrator?
i
thought
you
said
you
go
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well
all
right,
that
eliminates
one,
two,
three
and
four.
unknown
speaker
that
the
court
can
look
to.
how
about
five,
the
arbitration
proceeding
is
fair
and
regular
and
free
of
procedural
infirmities?
unknown
speaker
so,
just
those
two
and
you
think
to
the
extent?
unknown
speaker
which
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
good,
under
your
theory
of
deferral,
if
the
employer
could
come
in
on
an
action
to
set
aside
the
arbitration
award
assuming
it
had
gone
in
favor
of
the
employee
and
make
the
same
sort
of
showing
that
you’re
talking
about
an
employee
making
under
title
vii
action,
would
the
employer
then
be
entitled
to
have
the
arbitration
award
set
aside
on
a
proceeding
directed
to
that
end?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
whatever
section
you
go
in
to
have
an
arbitration
award
set
aside?
or
say
you’re
opposing
a
judicial
action
to
confirm
the
award
or
enforce
the
award?
unknown
speaker
you’re
talking
about
the
showing
that
must
be
made
by
an
employee
in
a
title
vii
case
that
the
type
of
procedure
that
district
court
should
follow
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
defer
to
the
arbitration
award.
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
in
a
case
not
involving
discrimination
an
employee
brings
action
to
enforce
an
arbitration
award
in
his
favor,
is
the
standard
that
the
district
court
is
to
employ
there
any
different
in
a
kind
of
standard
you’re
talking
about
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
is
this
basically
the
same
thing
or
is
it
something
added
because
of
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
arbitrator
may
not
just
disregard
this
applicable
substantive
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes
whatever
the
applicable
laws
are
in
the
areas?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
good
this
sounds
like
what
was
said
in
rios,
second,
it
must
be
plain
that
the
arbitrator’s
decision
is
no
way
violative
of
the
private
rights
guaranteed
by
title
vii
nor
the
public
policy
which
adheres
in
title
vii,
didn’t
you
say
to
me
earlier
that
you
agreed
with
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
do,
why
doesn’t
a
judge,
the
district
judge
to
be
satisfied
of
this
have
to
go
through
it
as
extensive
hearing
as
concerns
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
thus
far
the
fifth
circuit
stands
alone
and
its
enunciation
standards,
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
are
there
some
–-
are
there
some
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
or
this
court
that
indicates
that
an
arbitrator
is
not
bound
but
made
it
by
a
relevant
provision
of
the
substantive
law?
unknown
speaker
and
may
disregard
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know,
are
there
some
cases
then
to
say
that
the
arbitrator
is
bound
by
a
substantive?
let’s
assume
for
example
in
this
case
the
arbitrator
decided
there
was
no
racial
discrimination
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
title
vii,
whereas
a
decision
of
this
court
had
construed
the
title
vii
to
bar
precise
to
the
conduct
that
was
the
issue
before
the
arbitrator.
now,
is
there
some
case
that
says
the
arbitrator
must
follow
them
all?
unknown
speaker
i
thought,
you
told
us
earlier
counsel
about
how
difficult
it
was
to
get
a
lawyer
in
a
case
like
this.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
only
in
title
vii
cases
or
what?
unknown
speaker
only?
would
you
think
of
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
really
that
if
the
arbitration
machinery
is
only
enforceable
by
one
side
of
the
contract,
eventually
the
employer
would
ever
be
forced
to
go
to
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
no,
if
your
advise
your
clients
may
be
futile
if
the
employers
are
bound
to
go
arbitration?
