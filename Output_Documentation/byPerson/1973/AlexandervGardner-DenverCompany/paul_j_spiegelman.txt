mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
paul
spiegelman
and
i
am
counsel
for
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
questions
presented
today
are
we
believe
two.
first,
does
the
submission
of
a
grievance
to
arbitration
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
deprive
the
federal
courts
of
power
to
hear
a
statutory
claim
of
racial
discrimination
based
on
the
same
incident
which
gave
rise
to
the
grievance?
second,
under
what
circumstances
if
any
is
it
appropriate
for
a
federal
court
to
refuse
to
hear
a
claim
of
racial
discrimination
on
its
merits
because
the
person
raising
the
claim
has
pursued
a
contractual
remedy
which
arose
out
of
the
same
incident?
petitioner
is
a
black
man
who
was
hired
by
respondent
in
may
of
1966,
he
bid
on
and
was
awarded
a
drill
trainee
job
in
june
of
1968.
he
remained
in
that
job
until
he
was
discharged
on
september
29th,
1969
allegedly
because
he
accumulated
excessive
scrap.
petitioner
filed
a
grievance
on
october
1st
1969.
that
grievance
stated,
“i
feel
that
i
have
been
unjustly
discharged
and
asked
that
i
would
be
reinstated
with
full
seniority
in
pay.”
that
was
the
entire
grievance.
no
mention
was
made
of
issue
of
race.
the
grievance
was
apparently
brought
under
section
6
(a)
of
article
23
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
provided
that
no
employee
will
be
discharged,
suspended,
or
given
written
notice
except
for
just
cause.
the
contract
also
contains
an
ant-discrimination
clause
which
provides
that
the
company
and
the
union
agreed
that
there
shall
no
discrimination
against
any
employee
on
a
account
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
national
origin
or
ancestry.
article
23
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
sets
forth
the
procedures
for
handling
grievances.
essentially,
it
sets
up
a
five-step
procedure.
the
first
four
steps
involve
a
negotiation
between
the
company
and
the
union
and
that
failing
to
resolve
the
issue
with
fifth
step
of
arbitration.
arbitration
may
be
invoked
by
the
union
by
written
notice
if
the
first
four
steps
failed.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
no
provision
whatsoever
to
the
individual
to
force
arbitration
and
there
is
no
provision
specifically
indicating
than
anyone
can
withdraw
a
grievance
from
arbitration
once
it
has
been
refered
to
arbitration
by
the
union.
they
only
mention
of
any
withdrawal
or
implication
of
withdrawal
is
section
6
(f)
of
article
23
which
provides
that
company
may
convert
a
discharge
into
a
suspension
if
the
union
agrees
at
anytime
prior
to
arbitration.
the
procedures
also
provide
that,
the
failure
to
meet
the
time
limits
prescribed
therein
will
automatically
make
the
disciplinary
action
take
valid.
those
are
the
exact
words
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
agreement
further
provides
that
the
union
and
the
company
select
the
arbitrator.
no
provision
is
made
for
participation
of
the
employee
and
the
selection
of
the
arbitrator.
the
employee
is
not
under
the
agreement
even
technically
a
party
to
the
arbitration.
the
arbitrator’s
power
is
described
in
section
5
step
5,
it
provides,
the
arbitrator
shall
not
amend,
take
away,
add
to
or
change
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
agreement
and
that
the
arbitrator’s
decision
must
be
based
solely
upon
interpretation
of
the
agreement.
in
this
case,
the
company
denied
petitioner’s
grievance
in
the
first
four
steps.
prior
to
the
grievance
being
referred
to
arbitration,
the
petitioner
filed
the
charge
of
racial
discrimination
with
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
and
some
two
weeks
prior
to
the
actual
arbitration
hearing,
the
federal
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
assumed
jurisdiction
of
his
charge
on
depositions
which
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
we
certainly
believe
that
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination
was
not
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
it
specially
found
that
it
did
not.
it
indicated
that
the
issue
was
raised
in
arbitration
but
the
arbitrator’s
award
was
silent
as
to
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination.
there
was
no
mention
made
whatever
of
that
and
the
district
court’s
opinion
did
in
fact
note
that.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
the
record
is
not
the
best
on
that
issue.
i
would
say
that
what
the
record
does
state
is
this.
first,
petitioner
indicated
the
only
indication
of
it
is
from
the
deposition
of
petitioner
which
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
which
was
a
year
later?
yes,
the
statement
of
petitioner
and
that
seems
to
be
what
the
record
contains
on
this
issue,
two
things,
one
he
indicated
that
a
letter
that
he
had
written
to
the
union
was
read
verbatim
into
the
transcript.
that
letter
stated
that
and
i
am
quoting,
“i
am
knowledgeable
than
in
the
same
plant
others
have
scrapped
an
equal
amount
and
sometimes
in
excess
but
by
all
logical
reasoning
i,
harrell
alexander,
have
been
the
target
of
preferential
discriminatory
treatment.”
now,
the
deposition
indicates
that
mr.
alexander,
a
year
later
indicate
he
felt
that
was
raising
the
race
issue.
the
words
of
course
did
not
mention
the
issue
of
race.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
none,
whatever
i
point
out
though
that
there
is
a
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
in
the
arbitration
hearing?
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
no
sir,
this
was
a
summary
judgment
motion.
it
was
decided
on
paper,
so
i
point
out
that
the
record
does
indicate
that
there
was
the
following
question
and
answer
with
respect
to
what
happened
in
the
deposition.
the
question,
“when
you
took
the
stand,
did
you
try
and
water
down
the
race
issue
also?”
this
was
the
question
of
petitioner.
he
said,
“no,
i
didn’t.
i
held
it
up
at
the
time
i
told
them
that
i
already
filed
with
the
city
commission
because
i
could
not
rely
on
the
union.”
later
the
deposition
makes
clear
the
city
commission
refer
to
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
the
eeoc
had
discharged
before
the
arbitrator
decided.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
not
one
“race”
unless
you
take
preferential
discriminatory
treatment
to
mean
race.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
petitioner,
in
his
deposition
did
indicate
that
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
that
is
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
arbitrator
decided
it.
i
think
the
argument
is
that
since
it
was
raised
before
the
arbitrator?
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
the
petition
of
the
question
and
answer
which
i
gave
you,
the
statement
by
the
petitioner
that
he
said
that
he
had
filed
with
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
was
apparently
made
before
the
arbitrator.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
do
not
know
on
what
basis
unless
it
means
by
rejected
that
it
refused
to
consider
but
it
did
not
--
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
a
rejection
of
the
issue
of
race.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
no,
i
do
not
think
so
for
this
reason.
the
arbitrator
does
not
touch
on
the
issue
that
petitioner
raised
in
his
letter.
the
specific
issue,
the
petitioner
raised
in
his
letter
was
that
others
had
been
performing
with
the
same
amount
of
scrap
and
that
they
had
not
been
discharged.
now,
that
is
an
issue
which
if
there
is
a
racial
component
that
is
that
that
whites
who
were
performing
that
way
were
not
discharged
and
he
was
then
it
could
have
been
a
just
cause
for
dismissal
but
if
the
practice
was
not
to
dismiss
for
such
conduct
then
even
though
there
was
just
cause
they
could
have
been
a
discriminatory
action
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
the
arbitrator
--
that’s
correct.
the
arbitrator
limited
his
decisions
very
carefully
to
the
facts
that
were
presented
to
him.
i
know
that
in
another
issue
he
was
offered
the
statement
from
the
union
that
it
was
company
practice
to
send
the
trainee
who
performed
poorly
back
to
the
position
from
which
he
transferred
and
the
arbitrator
said
he
had
not
given
him
an
evidence
on
that.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
indicate
that
he
did
not
given
an
evidence
about
the
comparative
treatment
of
people
who
were
performing
poorly
in
the
drill
trainee
job.
so
i
think
it
would
stand
on
the
same
status.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
believe
that
our
argument
is
that
whether
or
not
the
issue
is
raised
that
arbitration
should
not
prevent
the
right
to
sue
in
federal
court.
now,
the
district
court’s
decision
in
this
case
relying
on
the
sole
ground
that
petitioner’s
pursuit
of
his
contractual
remedies
to
arbitration
barred
his
action
under
title
vii
and
the
court
purported
to
rely
on
dewey
versus
reynolds
metals
which
has
been
before
this
court
and
it
was
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
the
dewey
rationale
is
that
the
submission
of
a
grievance
to
arbitration
prior
to
submitting
the
grievance
to
--
submitting
the
claim
to
eeoc
constitutes
an
election
against
the
title
vii
process.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
the
memorandum
opinion
which
essentially
relied
on
the
district
court’s
opinion.
now,
we
believe
that
as
an
initial
matter,
it’s
clear
that
the
federal
court
have
plenary
power
over
charges
of
racial
discrimination
regardless
of
the
arbitration
process.
thus,
if
the
court
--
the
federal
courts
are
to
refrain
from
hearing
the
case,
it
is
not
because
of
their
lack
of
jurisdiction
but
because
of
some
other
reason
made
by
the
court.
now,
the
theory
apparently
offered
under
dewey
and
that
which
apparently
district
court
relies
on
is
a
theory
of
waiver.
i
submit
that
in
this
case
and
in
all
cases
thus
far
where
grievances
have
been
filed,
it
is
not
proper
to
talk
in
terms
of
waiver.
first,
let’s
take
the
facts
to
this
case.
petitioner
manifested
a
direct
intent
not
to
waive.
he
filed
charges
with
the
appropriate
federal
authorities.
he
informed
the
arbitrator
that
he
had
filed
those
charges.
he
informed
the
arbitrator
that
he
thought
his
representation
in
this
case
was
inadequate
and
surely
did
everything
he
could
to
follow
his
federal
rights
to
talk
in
terms
of
an
expressed
waiver
in
this
case.
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
problem.
now,
can
we
have
an
implied
waiver
in
this
case?
again,
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
proper.
we
are
talking
about
a
fundamental
civil
right
here
and
we
are
talking
about
a
layman
making
a
decision.
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
the
custom
to
imply
waivers
of
such
important
rights.
i
would
add
then
in
the
circumstances
of
grievance
proceedings
in
general,
we
not
only
have
the
facts
that
the
layman
is
making
a
decision
but
he
is
making
it
under
a
very,
very
short
time
limit.
that
is,
he
will
under
this
very
contract
in
this
case
he
will
automatically
make
the
discriminatory
discharge
valid
if
he
fails
to
grievance
in
this
contract
it’s
in
five
days.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
no
i
do
not
think
that
the
issue
was
necessarily
ineffective
assistance.
the
labor
law
makes
it
quite
clear
that
the
union
has
a
wide
variety
of
actions
it
can
take.
it
must
merely
not
acting
in
bad
faith
in
terms
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation
under
the
labor
law.
it
must
not
be
arbitrary
or
in
bad
faith.
now,
the
union
and
the
arbitration
process
is
one
that
contemplates
that
in
fact
the
union
doesn’t
hire
lawyers
for
these
arbitration
processes.
very
often,
the
arbitration
is
conducted
by
a
union
arbitration
man
who
has
had
no
legal
training.
so
the
process
itself
is
one
that
i
point
out
is
designed
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer
as
well
as
the
union.
the
employer
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
any
grievance
gets
labor
piece
by
a
no
strike
clause
which
is
the
quid
pro
quo
for
his
arbitration
agreement.
so
that
no
matter
what
happens
in
the
grievance
whether
the
employer
wins
or
loses,
he’s
already
got
what
he
bargained
for
and
that
is
that
the
union
will
not
strike
over
this
issue
and
he
can
enjoin
such
a
strike
under
boys
market
if
the
union
does
strike
over
such
an
issue.
so
the
employer
gets
what
he
bargains
for
the
minute
a
case
goes
to
arbitration.
now,
for
these
reasons
we
think
the
waiver
theory
is
inadequate.
the
other
theory
advanced
by
courts
and
not
relied
upon
but
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
the
theory
of
deferral.
the
deferral
theory
is
that
the
arbitrator
has
adequately
dealt
with
the
issues
and
it
will
save
judicial
time
and
energy
not
to
deal
with
these
questions.
we
point
out
that
the
civil
rights
act
embodies
a
fundamental
commitment
on
the
part
of
this
country
to
end
racial
discrimination
and
that
mere
judicial
economy
is
not
an
overriding
consideration
as
against
this
important
policy.
nonetheless
we
believe
that
deferral
to
the
arbitrator’s
award
is
not
an
appropriate
way
even
in
terms
of
judicial
economy
to
deal
with
important
civil
rights.
now,
in
doing
this
i
want
state
very
clearly
that
we
do
not
mean
to
denigrate
the
arbitration
process
as
an
efficient
way
of
dealing
with
normal
labor
disputes.
the
arbitration
process
is
well
embodied
in
the
labor
law
and
is
working
efficiently
to
deal
with
fast,
speedy,
efficient
relief
of
particular
law
of
the
charlotte
(ph)
kind
of
questions
which
are
characteristically
raised.
we
do
believe
however
that
there
are
things
about
the
arbitration
process
in
racial
cases
which
make
it
inappropriate
to
use
it
as
a
method
for
--
as
a
process
to
which
to
defer.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
if
in
fact
he
had
such
a
claim
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
if
he
or
she
has
such
a
claim,
he
can
raise
such
a
claim.
now,
in
order
to
bring
such
a
case
into
the
federal
court
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
i
don’t
think
so.
let
me
say
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
grievance
process
may
in
fact
screen
out
a
lot
of
these
cases.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
that
is
they
will
decide
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
prior
arbitration
and
in
arbitration.
often,
all
the
employee
wants
is
someone
neutral
to
determine
this
issue.
the
arbitrator's
finding
may
in
fact
satisfy
win
or
lose.
now,
if
he
does
--
if
the
employee
does
choose
to
follow
the
eeoc
route,
i
would
point
out
that
the
person
still
has
to
bring
the
case
to
court.
he’s
going
to
find
the
lawyer
or
be
appointed
to
counsel
to
bring
a
case
to
court.
also,
prior
to
anything
getting
to
court,
he
has
to
go
through
the
whole
eeoc
process
which
is
a
rather
time
consuming
process
and
also
offers
opportunities
for
conciliation
by
the
federal
authorities.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
believe
they
will
where
the
employee
feels
that
the
employers
got
in
a
fair
shape.
now,
i
understand
that
it’s
possible
that
the
employee
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
i
think
that
even
respondent
in
this
cases
indicated
that
the
that
regardless
of
what
the
federal
court’s
rule
is
the
employee
would
be
able
to
file
charges,
that’s
at
least
respondent’s
position
even
he
lost
the
arbitration
that
is
the
eeoc
would
process
its
claim
and
the
eeoc
could
in
fact
go
forward
in
this.
so
even
under
that
circumstance
it
would
not
prevent
the
case
from
getting
to
eeoc.
the
question
is
whether
these
claims
in
fact
would
come
to
court,
will
lawyers
take
these
claims?
if
they
are
doubtful,
i
doubt
that
they
will.
it’s
tough
enough
to
get
a
lawyer
to
handle
a
civil
rights
case
that
is
meritorious.
it
seems
unlikely
that
these
individual
claims
will
in
fact
be
those
that
are
largely
burdened
in
the
courts.
now,
i
would
say
that
there
are
overriding
considerations
here
though.
and
those
are
that
the
process
of
arbitration
owes
its
existence
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
itself
may
violate
title
vii.
if
for
the
union
representative,
there
has
a
built
in
conflict
of
interest
because
the
union
itself
may
be
liable
on
these
very
charges.
this
creates
also
problems
because
the
employer
in
the
union
not
the
individual
choose
the
arbitrator.
you
must
remember
that
the
union’s
interest
acting
in
good
faith
still
involved
of
the
variety
of
trade
offers
and
choices
which
it
must
make
and
it
is
representing
the
majority
members
of
that
union
under
the
labor
law.
and
perfectly
good
faith
decisions
of
the
union
may
in
fact
disadvantage
the
title
vii
plaintiff.
now,
i
would
finally
add
that
the
arbitration
process
is
simply
not
equipped
to
deal
with
the
subtle
issues
of
discrimination.
this
court
recently
in
mcdonnell
douglas
had
occasion
to
deal
with
the
difficult
questions
that
arise
in
proving
even
an
individual
case
of
discrimination.
for
example,
the
court
indicated
that
statistical
data
is
relevant
to
determining
such
a
claim.
now,
without
a
discovery
process
and
it's
normal
that
there
is
not
a
discovery
process,
there
is
no
opportunity
to
bring
this
kind
of
evidence
before
the
arbitrator.
also,
there
is
no
cross-examination
in
the
arbitration
process
and
having
tried
a
number
of
title
vii
cases.
the
fact
is
that
the
cross-examination
of
the
company
witnesses
is
one
of
the
key
basis
for
proving
the
case
of
discrimination.
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
deferral
is
not
appropriate
for
title
vii
case.
it
was
also
point
out
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
the
arbitrator
did
not
decide
the
race
issue.
he
did
not
say
anything
about
it.
he
specifically
said
there
was
no
evidence
dealing
with
that.
so,
i
think
that
deferral
is
in
any
case
improper
in
this
case.
there
is
also
the
issue
of
the
effect
of
deferral
on
--
of
allowing
deferral
on
the
grievance
process
itself
will
discourage
people
from
using
the
grievance
process
and
in
fact
channel
all
these
claims
into
federal
court
because
people
are
afraid
of
getting
an
arbitrator
who
is
not
sensitive
to
these
claims
rather
than
federal
court.
for
these
reasons,
we
think
that
the
decision
below
was
improper.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
reserve
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
i
am
anticipating
that
the
government
is
going
to
deal
with
that
question.
our
position
though
is
that
it
should
use
it
as
evidence
and
nothing
more.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i’d
like
to
first
deal
with
the
question
of
voluntariness
which
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
respondent’s
argument.
we
have
a
case
here
where
the
choice
of
arbitration
was
made
by
union.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
for
one
instance
that
petitioner
had
any
right
to
withdraw
that
grievance
once
the
union
went
ahead
with
it.
the
point
made
by
counsel
here
that
eeoc
advice
plaintiff
with
respect
to
his
rights
here
is
contrary
of
the
facts,
the
eeoc
told
me
had
a
right
to
sue.
they
issued
him
a
right
to
sue
at
it.
moreover,
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
a
man
files
a
charge
with
eeoc,
it
gets
put
in
the
file
and
it
maybe
six
or
eight
months
before
he
ever
hears
anybody
on
that.
so
the
notion
that
eeoc
provided
many
assistance
in
this
case
is
absurd.
now,
i
think
that
we
must
deal
with
the
issues
of
why
should
there
be
deferral
policy.
there
have
been
a
number
of
question
arguments
made.
the
government
has
told
us
that
the
labor
act
is
ill-served
by
a
policy
of
the
deferral
and
i
can
tell
you
there’s
a
private
lawyer
if
you
have
deferral
problem,
i
will
advise
every
one
of
my
clients
not
to
use
the
grievance
machinery.
the
federal
courts
will
if
anything
be
inundated
by
a
deferral
of
rule
because
all
the
clients
are
going
to
take
their
case
to
the
federal
courts
where
they
have
much
more
adequate
proceedings.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
will
say
that
with
respect
to
my
clients,
i
would
advise
them,
i
currently
advise
them
to
follow
the
grievance
machinery
and
if
there’s
deferral
policy,
i
would
advise
them
otherwise.
i
think
it
will
increase
the
burden
of
litigation.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
in
terms
of
title
vii
case,
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
don’t
know
the
answer
that
i’d
say
this
that
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
with
respect
to
labor
act
policies
of
policy
of
using
both
remedies
further
serves
that
policy
enforce
of
the
union
agreement.
i
would
say
that
the
employer
is
getting
an
advantage
here
because
he
also
already
got
his
quit
when
the
arbitration
is
filed.
that
is
his
got
union
peace
that’s
what
he
bought.
he’s
now
trying
to
get
a
license
to
conduct
practices
which
the
arbitrators
say
is
okay.
with
respect
to
the
law,
the
question
that
you
asked
earlier
about
arbitrators
and
how
they
act,
we
cited
three
cases
in
our
brief
in
which
the
arbitrators
refused
to
follow
title
vii
concepts
in
making
an
award.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
arbitrator
will
not
order
illegal
conduct
but
he
may
refrain
from
ordering
conduct
that
is
required
under
the
act.
now,
with
respect
to
the
economy
point,
i
think
we
have
indicated
that
an
economy
just
does
not
work.
the
courts
can’t
stay
out
of
this.
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about,
can
they
file?
they
can
always
file
and
they
always
have
to
go
through
the
deferral
process.
there’s
no
way
out
of
springing
these
case
as
a
federal
court
in
the
first
as
the
courts
have
power.
i
point
out
further
that
the
argument
here
that
the
comforts
will
be
inundated
by
a
deferral
policy
just
doesn’t
hold
up.
bowe
is
been
on
the
books
for
a
number
of
years.
bowe
versus
colgate,
the
seventh
circuit
doesn’t
defer
at
all.
there’s
no
evidence
here
of
any
deferral
policy
and
also
find
out
any
inundations
of
the
courts.
i
also
point
out
that
would
respect
to
this
issue
of
employers
dropping
their
arbitration
clause
is
i
think
that
is
wholly
speculative.
we
have
had
the
chamber
of
commerce
with
all
its
resources
coming
here
and
file
an
amicus
brief
and
the
best
they
can
do
is
cite
statistics
that
there
are
a
lot
of
anti-discrimination
clauses.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
however
that
arbitration
is
the
way
of
life.
it’s
a
strong
process.
it’s
going
to
be
used
regardless
of
whether
or
not
we
adopt
deferral
policy
or
for
the
reasons
we
have
indicated,
we
believe
that
deferral
just
simply
isn’t
proper.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
paul
spiegelman
and
i
am
counsel
for
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
questions
presented
today
are
we
believe
two.
first,
does
the
submission
of
a
grievance
to
arbitration
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
deprive
the
federal
courts
of
power
to
hear
a
statutory
claim
of
racial
discrimination
based
on
the
same
incident
which
gave
rise
to
the
grievance?
second,
under
what
circumstances
if
any
is
it
appropriate
for
a
federal
court
to
refuse
to
hear
a
claim
of
racial
discrimination
on
its
merits
because
the
person
raising
the
claim
has
pursued
a
contractual
remedy
which
arose
out
of
the
same
incident?
petitioner
is
a
black
man
who
was
hired
by
respondent
in
may
of
1966,
he
bid
on
and
was
awarded
a
drill
trainee
job
in
june
of
1968.
he
remained
in
that
job
until
he
was
discharged
on
september
29th,
1969
allegedly
because
he
accumulated
excessive
scrap.
petitioner
filed
a
grievance
on
october
1st
1969.
that
grievance
stated,
“i
feel
that
i
have
been
unjustly
discharged
and
asked
that
i
would
be
reinstated
with
full
seniority
in
pay.”
that
was
the
entire
grievance.
no
mention
was
made
of
issue
of
race.
the
grievance
was
apparently
brought
under
section
6
(a)
of
article
23
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
provided
that
no
employee
will
be
discharged,
suspended,
or
given
written
notice
except
for
just
cause.
the
contract
also
contains
an
ant-discrimination
clause
which
provides
that
the
company
and
the
union
agreed
that
there
shall
no
discrimination
against
any
employee
on
a
account
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
national
origin
or
ancestry.
article
23
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
sets
forth
the
procedures
for
handling
grievances.
essentially,
it
sets
up
a
five-step
procedure.
the
first
four
steps
involve
a
negotiation
between
the
company
and
the
union
and
that
failing
to
resolve
the
issue
with
fifth
step
of
arbitration.
arbitration
may
be
invoked
by
the
union
by
written
notice
if
the
first
four
steps
failed.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
no
provision
whatsoever
to
the
individual
to
force
arbitration
and
there
is
no
provision
specifically
indicating
than
anyone
can
withdraw
a
grievance
from
arbitration
once
it
has
been
refered
to
arbitration
by
the
union.
they
only
mention
of
any
withdrawal
or
implication
of
withdrawal
is
section
6
(f)
of
article
23
which
provides
that
company
may
convert
a
discharge
into
a
suspension
if
the
union
agrees
at
anytime
prior
to
arbitration.
the
procedures
also
provide
that,
the
failure
to
meet
the
time
limits
prescribed
therein
will
automatically
make
the
disciplinary
action
take
valid.
those
are
the
exact
words
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
agreement
further
provides
that
the
union
and
the
company
select
the
arbitrator.
no
provision
is
made
for
participation
of
the
employee
and
the
selection
of
the
arbitrator.
the
employee
is
not
under
the
agreement
even
technically
a
party
to
the
arbitration.
the
arbitrator’s
power
is
described
in
section
5
step
5,
it
provides,
the
arbitrator
shall
not
amend,
take
away,
add
to
or
change
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
agreement
and
that
the
arbitrator’s
decision
must
be
based
solely
upon
interpretation
of
the
agreement.
in
this
case,
the
company
denied
petitioner’s
grievance
in
the
first
four
steps.
prior
to
the
grievance
being
referred
to
arbitration,
the
petitioner
filed
the
charge
of
racial
discrimination
with
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
and
some
two
weeks
prior
to
the
actual
arbitration
hearing,
the
federal
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
assumed
jurisdiction
of
his
charge
on
depositions
which
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
we
certainly
believe
that
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination
was
not
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
it
specially
found
that
it
did
not.
it
indicated
that
the
issue
was
raised
in
arbitration
but
the
arbitrator’s
award
was
silent
as
to
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination.
there
was
no
mention
made
whatever
of
that
and
the
district
court’s
opinion
did
in
fact
note
that.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
the
record
is
not
the
best
on
that
issue.
i
would
say
that
what
the
record
does
state
is
this.
first,
petitioner
indicated
the
only
indication
of
it
is
from
the
deposition
of
petitioner
which
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
which
was
a
year
later?
yes,
the
statement
of
petitioner
and
that
seems
to
be
what
the
record
contains
on
this
issue,
two
things,
one
he
indicated
that
a
letter
that
he
had
written
to
the
union
was
read
verbatim
into
the
transcript.
that
letter
stated
that
and
i
am
quoting,
“i
am
knowledgeable
than
in
the
same
plant
others
have
scrapped
an
equal
amount
and
sometimes
in
excess
but
by
all
logical
reasoning
i,
harrell
alexander,
have
been
the
target
of
preferential
discriminatory
treatment.”
now,
the
deposition
indicates
that
mr.
alexander,
a
year
later
indicate
he
felt
that
was
raising
the
race
issue.
the
words
of
course
did
not
mention
the
issue
of
race.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
none,
whatever
i
point
out
though
that
there
is
a
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
in
the
arbitration
hearing?
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
no
sir,
this
was
a
summary
judgment
motion.
it
was
decided
on
paper,
so
i
point
out
that
the
record
does
indicate
that
there
was
the
following
question
and
answer
with
respect
to
what
happened
in
the
deposition.
the
question,
“when
you
took
the
stand,
did
you
try
and
water
down
the
race
issue
also?”
this
was
the
question
of
petitioner.
he
said,
“no,
i
didn’t.
i
held
it
up
at
the
time
i
told
them
that
i
already
filed
with
the
city
commission
because
i
could
not
rely
on
the
union.”
later
the
deposition
makes
clear
the
city
commission
refer
to
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
the
eeoc
had
discharged
before
the
arbitrator
decided.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
not
one
“race”
unless
you
take
preferential
discriminatory
treatment
to
mean
race.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
petitioner,
in
his
deposition
did
indicate
that
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
that
is
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
arbitrator
decided
it.
i
think
the
argument
is
that
since
it
was
raised
before
the
arbitrator?
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
the
petition
of
the
question
and
answer
which
i
gave
you,
the
statement
by
the
petitioner
that
he
said
that
he
had
filed
with
the
colorado
civil
rights
commission
was
apparently
made
before
the
arbitrator.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
do
not
know
on
what
basis
unless
it
means
by
rejected
that
it
refused
to
consider
but
it
did
not
--
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
a
rejection
of
the
issue
of
race.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
no,
i
do
not
think
so
for
this
reason.
the
arbitrator
does
not
touch
on
the
issue
that
petitioner
raised
in
his
letter.
the
specific
issue,
the
petitioner
raised
in
his
letter
was
that
others
had
been
performing
with
the
same
amount
of
scrap
and
that
they
had
not
been
discharged.
now,
that
is
an
issue
which
if
there
is
a
racial
component
that
is
that
that
whites
who
were
performing
that
way
were
not
discharged
and
he
was
then
it
could
have
been
a
just
cause
for
dismissal
but
if
the
practice
was
not
to
dismiss
for
such
conduct
then
even
though
there
was
just
cause
they
could
have
been
a
discriminatory
action
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
the
arbitrator
--
that’s
correct.
the
arbitrator
limited
his
decisions
very
carefully
to
the
facts
that
were
presented
to
him.
i
know
that
in
another
issue
he
was
offered
the
statement
from
the
union
that
it
was
company
practice
to
send
the
trainee
who
performed
poorly
back
to
the
position
from
which
he
transferred
and
the
arbitrator
said
he
had
not
given
him
an
evidence
on
that.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
indicate
that
he
did
not
given
an
evidence
about
the
comparative
treatment
of
people
who
were
performing
poorly
in
the
drill
trainee
job.
so
i
think
it
would
stand
on
the
same
status.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
believe
that
our
argument
is
that
whether
or
not
the
issue
is
raised
that
arbitration
should
not
prevent
the
right
to
sue
in
federal
court.
now,
the
district
court’s
decision
in
this
case
relying
on
the
sole
ground
that
petitioner’s
pursuit
of
his
contractual
remedies
to
arbitration
barred
his
action
under
title
vii
and
the
court
purported
to
rely
on
dewey
versus
reynolds
metals
which
has
been
before
this
court
and
it
was
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
the
dewey
rationale
is
that
the
submission
of
a
grievance
to
arbitration
prior
to
submitting
the
grievance
to
--
submitting
the
claim
to
eeoc
constitutes
an
election
against
the
title
vii
process.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
the
memorandum
opinion
which
essentially
relied
on
the
district
court’s
opinion.
now,
we
believe
that
as
an
initial
matter,
it’s
clear
that
the
federal
court
have
plenary
power
over
charges
of
racial
discrimination
regardless
of
the
arbitration
process.
thus,
if
the
court
--
the
federal
courts
are
to
refrain
from
hearing
the
case,
it
is
not
because
of
their
lack
of
jurisdiction
but
because
of
some
other
reason
made
by
the
court.
now,
the
theory
apparently
offered
under
dewey
and
that
which
apparently
district
court
relies
on
is
a
theory
of
waiver.
i
submit
that
in
this
case
and
in
all
cases
thus
far
where
grievances
have
been
filed,
it
is
not
proper
to
talk
in
terms
of
waiver.
first,
let’s
take
the
facts
to
this
case.
petitioner
manifested
a
direct
intent
not
to
waive.
he
filed
charges
with
the
appropriate
federal
authorities.
he
informed
the
arbitrator
that
he
had
filed
those
charges.
he
informed
the
arbitrator
that
he
thought
his
representation
in
this
case
was
inadequate
and
surely
did
everything
he
could
to
follow
his
federal
rights
to
talk
in
terms
of
an
expressed
waiver
in
this
case.
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
problem.
now,
can
we
have
an
implied
waiver
in
this
case?
again,
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
proper.
we
are
talking
about
a
fundamental
civil
right
here
and
we
are
talking
about
a
layman
making
a
decision.
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
the
custom
to
imply
waivers
of
such
important
rights.
i
would
add
then
in
the
circumstances
of
grievance
proceedings
in
general,
we
not
only
have
the
facts
that
the
layman
is
making
a
decision
but
he
is
making
it
under
a
very,
very
short
time
limit.
that
is,
he
will
under
this
very
contract
in
this
case
he
will
automatically
make
the
discriminatory
discharge
valid
if
he
fails
to
grievance
in
this
contract
it’s
in
five
days.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
no
i
do
not
think
that
the
issue
was
necessarily
ineffective
assistance.
the
labor
law
makes
it
quite
clear
that
the
union
has
a
wide
variety
of
actions
it
can
take.
it
must
merely
not
acting
in
bad
faith
in
terms
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation
under
the
labor
law.
it
must
not
be
arbitrary
or
in
bad
faith.
now,
the
union
and
the
arbitration
process
is
one
that
contemplates
that
in
fact
the
union
doesn’t
hire
lawyers
for
these
arbitration
processes.
very
often,
the
arbitration
is
conducted
by
a
union
arbitration
man
who
has
had
no
legal
training.
so
the
process
itself
is
one
that
i
point
out
is
designed
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer
as
well
as
the
union.
the
employer
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
any
grievance
gets
labor
piece
by
a
no
strike
clause
which
is
the
quid
pro
quo
for
his
arbitration
agreement.
so
that
no
matter
what
happens
in
the
grievance
whether
the
employer
wins
or
loses,
he’s
already
got
what
he
bargained
for
and
that
is
that
the
union
will
not
strike
over
this
issue
and
he
can
enjoin
such
a
strike
under
boys
market
if
the
union
does
strike
over
such
an
issue.
so
the
employer
gets
what
he
bargains
for
the
minute
a
case
goes
to
arbitration.
now,
for
these
reasons
we
think
the
waiver
theory
is
inadequate.
the
other
theory
advanced
by
courts
and
not
relied
upon
but
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
the
theory
of
deferral.
the
deferral
theory
is
that
the
arbitrator
has
adequately
dealt
with
the
issues
and
it
will
save
judicial
time
and
energy
not
to
deal
with
these
questions.
we
point
out
that
the
civil
rights
act
embodies
a
fundamental
commitment
on
the
part
of
this
country
to
end
racial
discrimination
and
that
mere
judicial
economy
is
not
an
overriding
consideration
as
against
this
important
policy.
nonetheless
we
believe
that
deferral
to
the
arbitrator’s
award
is
not
an
appropriate
way
even
in
terms
of
judicial
economy
to
deal
with
important
civil
rights.
now,
in
doing
this
i
want
state
very
clearly
that
we
do
not
mean
to
denigrate
the
arbitration
process
as
an
efficient
way
of
dealing
with
normal
labor
disputes.
the
arbitration
process
is
well
embodied
in
the
labor
law
and
is
working
efficiently
to
deal
with
fast,
speedy,
efficient
relief
of
particular
law
of
the
charlotte
(ph)
kind
of
questions
which
are
characteristically
raised.
we
do
believe
however
that
there
are
things
about
the
arbitration
process
in
racial
cases
which
make
it
inappropriate
to
use
it
as
a
method
for
--
as
a
process
to
which
to
defer.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
if
in
fact
he
had
such
a
claim
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
if
he
or
she
has
such
a
claim,
he
can
raise
such
a
claim.
now,
in
order
to
bring
such
a
case
into
the
federal
court
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
i
don’t
think
so.
let
me
say
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
grievance
process
may
in
fact
screen
out
a
lot
of
these
cases.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
that
is
they
will
decide
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
prior
arbitration
and
in
arbitration.
often,
all
the
employee
wants
is
someone
neutral
to
determine
this
issue.
the
arbitrator's
finding
may
in
fact
satisfy
win
or
lose.
now,
if
he
does
--
if
the
employee
does
choose
to
follow
the
eeoc
route,
i
would
point
out
that
the
person
still
has
to
bring
the
case
to
court.
he’s
going
to
find
the
lawyer
or
be
appointed
to
counsel
to
bring
a
case
to
court.
also,
prior
to
anything
getting
to
court,
he
has
to
go
through
the
whole
eeoc
process
which
is
a
rather
time
consuming
process
and
also
offers
opportunities
for
conciliation
by
the
federal
authorities.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
believe
they
will
where
the
employee
feels
that
the
employers
got
in
a
fair
shape.
now,
i
understand
that
it’s
possible
that
the
employee
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes,
i
think
that
even
respondent
in
this
cases
indicated
that
the
that
regardless
of
what
the
federal
court’s
rule
is
the
employee
would
be
able
to
file
charges,
that’s
at
least
respondent’s
position
even
he
lost
the
arbitration
that
is
the
eeoc
would
process
its
claim
and
the
eeoc
could
in
fact
go
forward
in
this.
so
even
under
that
circumstance
it
would
not
prevent
the
case
from
getting
to
eeoc.
the
question
is
whether
these
claims
in
fact
would
come
to
court,
will
lawyers
take
these
claims?
if
they
are
doubtful,
i
doubt
that
they
will.
it’s
tough
enough
to
get
a
lawyer
to
handle
a
civil
rights
case
that
is
meritorious.
it
seems
unlikely
that
these
individual
claims
will
in
fact
be
those
that
are
largely
burdened
in
the
courts.
now,
i
would
say
that
there
are
overriding
considerations
here
though.
and
those
are
that
the
process
of
arbitration
owes
its
existence
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
itself
may
violate
title
vii.
if
for
the
union
representative,
there
has
a
built
in
conflict
of
interest
because
the
union
itself
may
be
liable
on
these
very
charges.
this
creates
also
problems
because
the
employer
in
the
union
not
the
individual
choose
the
arbitrator.
you
must
remember
that
the
union’s
interest
acting
in
good
faith
still
involved
of
the
variety
of
trade
offers
and
choices
which
it
must
make
and
it
is
representing
the
majority
members
of
that
union
under
the
labor
law.
and
perfectly
good
faith
decisions
of
the
union
may
in
fact
disadvantage
the
title
vii
plaintiff.
now,
i
would
finally
add
that
the
arbitration
process
is
simply
not
equipped
to
deal
with
the
subtle
issues
of
discrimination.
this
court
recently
in
mcdonnell
douglas
had
occasion
to
deal
with
the
difficult
questions
that
arise
in
proving
even
an
individual
case
of
discrimination.
for
example,
the
court
indicated
that
statistical
data
is
relevant
to
determining
such
a
claim.
now,
without
a
discovery
process
and
it's
normal
that
there
is
not
a
discovery
process,
there
is
no
opportunity
to
bring
this
kind
of
evidence
before
the
arbitrator.
also,
there
is
no
cross-examination
in
the
arbitration
process
and
having
tried
a
number
of
title
vii
cases.
the
fact
is
that
the
cross-examination
of
the
company
witnesses
is
one
of
the
key
basis
for
proving
the
case
of
discrimination.
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
deferral
is
not
appropriate
for
title
vii
case.
it
was
also
point
out
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
the
arbitrator
did
not
decide
the
race
issue.
he
did
not
say
anything
about
it.
he
specifically
said
there
was
no
evidence
dealing
with
that.
so,
i
think
that
deferral
is
in
any
case
improper
in
this
case.
there
is
also
the
issue
of
the
effect
of
deferral
on
--
of
allowing
deferral
on
the
grievance
process
itself
will
discourage
people
from
using
the
grievance
process
and
in
fact
channel
all
these
claims
into
federal
court
because
people
are
afraid
of
getting
an
arbitrator
who
is
not
sensitive
to
these
claims
rather
than
federal
court.
for
these
reasons,
we
think
that
the
decision
below
was
improper.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
reserve
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
i
am
anticipating
that
the
government
is
going
to
deal
with
that
question.
our
position
though
is
that
it
should
use
it
as
evidence
and
nothing
more.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i’d
like
to
first
deal
with
the
question
of
voluntariness
which
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
respondent’s
argument.
we
have
a
case
here
where
the
choice
of
arbitration
was
made
by
union.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
for
one
instance
that
petitioner
had
any
right
to
withdraw
that
grievance
once
the
union
went
ahead
with
it.
the
point
made
by
counsel
here
that
eeoc
advice
plaintiff
with
respect
to
his
rights
here
is
contrary
of
the
facts,
the
eeoc
told
me
had
a
right
to
sue.
they
issued
him
a
right
to
sue
at
it.
moreover,
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
a
man
files
a
charge
with
eeoc,
it
gets
put
in
the
file
and
it
maybe
six
or
eight
months
before
he
ever
hears
anybody
on
that.
so
the
notion
that
eeoc
provided
many
assistance
in
this
case
is
absurd.
now,
i
think
that
we
must
deal
with
the
issues
of
why
should
there
be
deferral
policy.
there
have
been
a
number
of
question
arguments
made.
the
government
has
told
us
that
the
labor
act
is
ill-served
by
a
policy
of
the
deferral
and
i
can
tell
you
there’s
a
private
lawyer
if
you
have
deferral
problem,
i
will
advise
every
one
of
my
clients
not
to
use
the
grievance
machinery.
the
federal
courts
will
if
anything
be
inundated
by
a
deferral
of
rule
because
all
the
clients
are
going
to
take
their
case
to
the
federal
courts
where
they
have
much
more
adequate
proceedings.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
will
say
that
with
respect
to
my
clients,
i
would
advise
them,
i
currently
advise
them
to
follow
the
grievance
machinery
and
if
there’s
deferral
policy,
i
would
advise
them
otherwise.
i
think
it
will
increase
the
burden
of
litigation.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
in
terms
of
title
vii
case,
that’s
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
i
don’t
know
the
answer
that
i’d
say
this
that
--
mr.
paul
j.
spiegelman
well,
what
i’m
saying
is
that
with
respect
to
labor
act
policies
of
policy
of
using
both
remedies
further
serves
that
policy
enforce
of
the
union
agreement.
i
would
say
that
the
employer
is
getting
an
advantage
here
because
he
also
already
got
his
quit
when
the
arbitration
is
filed.
that
is
his
got
union
peace
that’s
what
he
bought.
he’s
now
trying
to
get
a
license
to
conduct
practices
which
the
arbitrators
say
is
okay.
with
respect
to
the
law,
the
question
that
you
asked
earlier
about
arbitrators
and
how
they
act,
we
cited
three
cases
in
our
brief
in
which
the
arbitrators
refused
to
follow
title
vii
concepts
in
making
an
award.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
arbitrator
will
not
order
illegal
conduct
but
he
may
refrain
from
ordering
conduct
that
is
required
under
the
act.
now,
with
respect
to
the
economy
point,
i
think
we
have
indicated
that
an
economy
just
does
not
work.
the
courts
can’t
stay
out
of
this.
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about,
can
they
file?
they
can
always
file
and
they
always
have
to
go
through
the
deferral
process.
there’s
no
way
out
of
springing
these
case
as
a
federal
court
in
the
first
as
the
courts
have
power.
i
point
out
further
that
the
argument
here
that
the
comforts
will
be
inundated
by
a
deferral
policy
just
doesn’t
hold
up.
bowe
is
been
on
the
books
for
a
number
of
years.
bowe
versus
colgate,
the
seventh
circuit
doesn’t
defer
at
all.
there’s
no
evidence
here
of
any
deferral
policy
and
also
find
out
any
inundations
of
the
courts.
i
also
point
out
that
would
respect
to
this
issue
of
employers
dropping
their
arbitration
clause
is
i
think
that
is
wholly
speculative.
we
have
had
the
chamber
of
commerce
with
all
its
resources
coming
here
and
file
an
amicus
brief
and
the
best
they
can
do
is
cite
statistics
that
there
are
a
lot
of
anti-discrimination
clauses.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
however
that
arbitration
is
the
way
of
life.
it’s
a
strong
process.
it’s
going
to
be
used
regardless
of
whether
or
not
we
adopt
deferral
policy
or
for
the
reasons
we
have
indicated,
we
believe
that
deferral
just
simply
isn’t
proper.
