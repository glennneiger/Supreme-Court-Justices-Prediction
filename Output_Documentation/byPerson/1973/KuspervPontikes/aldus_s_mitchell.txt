mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
board
of
election
commissioners
of
city
of
chicago.
our
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
decision
in
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court,
northern
district
illinois
finding
a
section
of
illinois
election
code
unconstitutional.
the
section
that’s
involved
is
chapter
46,
section
7-43
(d)
of
the
illinois
revised
statute.
that
section
provides
that
there
can
be
changes
in
participation
in
political
party
primaries,
only
if
23
months
has
elapsed
since
the
time
that
the
voter
has
last
participated
in
a
primary
election.
i
think
it’s
important
here
that
this
court
understand
that
the
territory
of
the
board
of
election
commissioners
of
city
of
chicago
encompasses
the
city
of
chicago
and
four
suburban
towns
at
the
time
that
this
case
came
to
the
court.
those
towns
were
the
towns
of
berwyn,
cicero,
stickney
and
lyons.
in
addition,
the
city
of
chicago
is
divided
into
50
wards
and
in
the
50
wards
and
the
four
suburban
towns,
there
are
approximately
3500
precincts.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
single
voter
from
the
36th
precinct
of
the
50th
ward
of
the
city
of
chicago,
who
brought
in
action
claiming
that
section
7-43
(d)
of
the
illinois
election
code
deprived
her
of
a
right
to
participate
in
the
primary
election
to
be
held
on
march
21,
1972.
she
filed
a
complaint
asking
that
section
7-43
be
declared
unconstitutional.
in
that
complaint,
she
alleged
that
she
had
voted
in
the
republican
primary
in
1971.
the
republican
party
primary
for
the
chicago
municipal
officers,
that
there
was
section
7-43
(d)
of
the
code
which
prohibited
her
from
voting
in
the
march
21,
1972
democratic
party
primary
election.
and
she
asked
the
court
to
find
that
that
section
deprived
her
of
rights
guaranteed
protected
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that
this
case
presents
two
basic
problems,
two
basic
differences
between
the
plaintiffs
or
appellants
here
and
the
defendant
--
the
defendants
were
appellants
here
and
the
plaintiffs.
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
courts,
the
federal
court
system
has
a
right
in
every
claim
made
by
a
voter
to
take
jurisdiction
and
to
decide
that
question
on
whether
or
not
the
federal
courts
are
limited
by
the
terms
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
particularly
the
tenth
amendment,
to
those
situations
in
which
that
is
a
demonstrated
interference
with
a
right
that
is
granted
by
some
other
section
of
the
constitution.
i
don’t
think
that
there’s
any
question
here
that
there
is
a
right
to
vote.
but
in
the
case
that’s
before
the
court,
the
claim
that
there
was
a
denial
by
any
section
of
the
illinois
election
code
is
erroneous.
what
mrs.
pontikes
complains
about
is
that
she
is
not
permitted
to
participate
in
primary
elections
and
she
sees
fit.
the
state
of
illinois
has
seen
fit
to
set
up
regulations
which
in
there
in
fact
as
to
protect
the
integrity
of
political
parties
and
it
is
not
just
the
integrity
of
the
democratic
and
republican
party,
but
it
is
designed
to
protect
the
integrity
of
any
political
group
which
comes
together
and
asserts
itself
under
the
terms
of
the
election
code.
the
complaint
that
mrs.
pontikes
brought,
we
believe
was
insufficient
to
ward
the
district
court
in
undertaking
to
hear
and
decide
the
case.
the
bare
on
its
face,
the
most
that
she
says
is
that
she
desires
to
participate
in
an
election,
a
democratic
party
primary
elections
and
that
the
section
of
the
statute
involved
here
would
prevent
her
doing
so.
i
think
that
a
look
at
the
statute
discloses
that
that
just
is
not
true.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice.
but
we
take
the
position
that
judge
marovitz
was
wrong
on
the
procedure.
this
was
a
case
that
should
never
in
which
a
three-judge
court
should
never
have
been
convoked
because
the
complaint
on
its
face
was
insufficient,
to
state
of
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
in
the
district
court.
there
is
certainly
no
claim
here
of
any
discrimination
by
the
illinois
election
code
between
the
plaintiff
and
any
other
citizen
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
there
is
no
claim
that
there
is
any
denial
of
due
process
as
might
have
been
involved
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
it’s
just
the
flat
assertion
that
she
will
not
be
permitted
to
participate
in
the
democratic
party
primary
in
1972.
that’s
statewide
because
she
had
participated
in
the
primary
election
for
republican
party
for
municipal
offices
in
the
prior
year
within
23
months
of
the
election
that
was
to
be
held
on
march
21,
1972.
i
think
that
there
were
a
series
of
problems
that
were
overlooked
by
the
judge
to
whom
the
case
was
originally
assigned.
even
if
you
get
passed
the
hurdle
of
whether
or
not
the
complaints’
states
of
claim
upon
which
relief
may
be
granted,
i
think
you
run
head
on
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
case
that
ought
to
be
heard
by
the
court.
in
illinois,
there
had
been
an
interpretation,
a
construction
of
the
statute
involved.
in
faherty
versus
board
of
election
commissioners
in
which
the
illinois
court
had
decided
that
participation
in
a
statewide
primary
would
determine
how
you
could
participate,
the
party’s
primary
that
you
could
participate
in
after
the
municipal
office
is
left.
now,
i
think
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
they
mentioned
that
they
did
not
believe
that
the
constitution
required
or
permitted
that
these
people,
that
citizens,
voters
be
locked
in
to
a
particular
political
party
at
every
level
of
government
or
at
every
level
of
politics.
we
do
not
argue
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
as
we
broke,
i
was
speaking
to
the
question
of
the
complaint
which
had
been
filed
by
mrs.
pontikes
in
the
case
at
bar.
i
had
just
suggested
that
she
had
not
made
any
allegations
in
that
complaint
indicating
that
she
claimed
any
denial
of
equal
protection
nor
had
she
made
any
claim
that
the
statute
denied
her
due
process
of
a
sort
that
the
court
had
spoken
to
in
william
versus
rhodes.
i
think
that
this,
the
fact
that
these
allegations
were
not
made,
very
serious
questions
as
to
her
standing
to
maintain
the
action.
i
think
that
the
court
for
quite
a
long
time
and
more
recently
in
jiggens
versus
mckeegan
(ph)
had
decided
that
unless
the
person
bringing
the
lawsuit
could
indicate
in
some
fashion
that
they
were
going
to
be
harmed
and
damaged
in
some
way
differently
from
the
way
in
which
the
other
members
of
the
community
would
be
harmed
by
the
statute
that
they
had
no
right
to
maintain
a
lawsuit.
i
think
that
all
of
these
are
questions
that
were
in
the
bosom
of
the
judge
to
whom
the
case
was
originally
assigned
in
the
district
court.
at
the
time
that
a
motion
was
made
to
convene
the
three-judge
court
pursuant
to
the
statute,
i
think
that
the
district
judge
at
that
point
did
not
carry
out
his
responsibility
on
the
laws,
the
rules
and
the
law
by
searching
this
complaint
and
deciding
all
of
these
questions
before
convoking
that
three-judge
court,
before
asking
the
chief
judge
of
the
seventh
circuit
to
convoke
that
three-judge
court.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
think
that
--
well
they
allude
to
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
though
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
we
have
raised
this
in
the
section
of
the
brief
where
we
suggest
that
the
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well
i
think
this
is
necessarily
included
in
the
questions
that
we
presented
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
i
think
that
the
rules
provide
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
but
i
think
that
the
jurisdictional
questions
are
questions
that
were
necessarily
included
in
any
question
that
is
presented
in
this
court
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
this
court
has
determined
that
it
has
the
right
to
look
at
that
question
and
to
decide
that
question
no
matter
what
other
questions
might
have
been
raised
by
the
parties.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
would
take
note
and
do
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
on
pager
4,
we
did
set
out
the
questions.
but
we
thought
that
those
are
necessarily
included
in
the
questions
that
we
had
set
out
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
i
think
that
once
the
question
of
the
three-judge
court
had
been
presented
to
the
district
judge
and
the
court
had
been
convened
that
there
were
two
questions
that
faced
both
the
district
judge
before
the
court
is
convened
and
the
court
at
the
time
it
was
sitting
and
that
was
whether
or
not
this
was
the
sort
of
question
that
the
statute
2281
had
considered
to
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court
whether
or
not
this
was
a
local
question
which
should
be
decided
by
a
single
judge.
and
if
that
question
was
answered
in
the
affirmative,
it
was
a
local
matter.
the
three-judge
court
should
have
returned
the
matter
to
a
single
judge.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
single
individual
who
is
a
resident
of
one
precinct
out
of
some
3500
precincts
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
who
claims
to
be
affected
by
statute
which
on
its
face
seems
to
show
that
there
are
some
areas
in
the
state
of
illinois
which
will
not
be
affected
by
the
terms
of
that
statute.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
of
election
commissioners
in
this
case
is
limited
to
the
city
of
chicago.
the
other
areas
in
the
county
of
cook
do
not
have
the
republican
and
democratic
parties
presenting
candidates
for
election,
for
municipal
office
and
we
suggest
that
in
that
circumstance
that
this
is
the
local
situation,
that
is
not
included
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
statutory
three-judge
court.
but
i
think
even
more
important,
even
if
there
is
jurisdiction,
i
think
the
court
faces
a
further
problem
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
should
hear
and
decide
the
particular
case
that
it
is
presented
with.
we
would
suggest
here
that
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
not
considered
this
statute
on
the
factual
situation
that
was
presented
in
this
case,
that
this
was
a
proper
case
before
the
court
not
to
construe
that
statute,
but
to
allow
the
illinois
courts
to
construe
it.
the
illinois
court
had
considered
the
case
--
considered
the
statute
in
the
case
of
faherty
versus
the
board
of
election
commissioners
in
the
city
of
chicago
in
determining
whether
or
not
participation
at
the
statewide
primary
level
would
determine
the
political
party
primary
that
a
voter
could
participate
in,
in
the
municipal
offices
primary.
they
had
decided
that
it
did.
we
suggest
that
that
decision
does
not
--
is
not
a
decision
or
an
indication
that
it
would
decide
the
adverse
of
that
question
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
participation
in
a
municipal
primary
which
mrs.
pontikes
alleged
here
also
prevents
a
change
in
political
party
primary
when
the
statewide
primary
is
being
held.
these
are
questions
that
should
be
left
to
the
illinois
courts.
i
think
that
the
court
has
in
numerous
cases
decided
that
where
a
statute
is
capable
of
a
construction
which
would
prevent
the
statute
from
being
determined
to
be
unconstitutional
that
the
presumption
should
be
that
it
will
be
construed
in
that
fashion
and
the
courts
that
were
primarily
concerned
with
the
statutory
construction
should
be
allowed
to
construe
the
statute.
it
was
not
done
in
this
case
though
there
is
a
ready
means
of
that
in
the
state
of
illinois
because
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
statute
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
decided
that
election
matters
or
matters
which
can
be
determined
under
that
declaratory
judgment
action
or
declaratory
judgment
statute
and
under
that
statute,
declaratory
judgment
matters
were
given
preference
over
other
matters
that
are
pending
in
the
courts.
so
that
this
could
have
been
quite
rapidly
done
probably
in
time
for
a
decision
to
have
been
made
on
the
construction
to
be
given
to
that
statute
before
the
election
in
all
probability
in
time
for
the
federal
court
to
have
considered
the
matter
if
the
plaintiff
felt
that
the
construction
was
erroneous
and
left
open
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
was
constitutionally
deficient.
we
think
that
in
these
circumstances,
the
court
should
have
abstained
and
that
the
matter
should
be
returned
to
the
illinois
courts
so
that
they
might
consider
the
statute
rather
than
having
to
live
with
an
interpretation
by
a
federal
court
which
is
not
used
to
dealing
with
vagaries
of
the
illinois
election
code.
the
statute
here
is
a
part
of
an
integrated
scheme
for
carrying
on
elections
and
on
numerous
other
aspects
of
the
elections
--
of
the
election
code
that
are
affected
by
a
decision
that
section
7-43
(d)
of
the
illinois
election
code
is
unconstitutional.
we
have
the
matter
of
determining
who
will
participate
in
the
election
as
election
judges,
who
can
be
canvassers?
who
can
sign
nominating
petitions
and
that
sort
of
thing
with
no
provision
for
identifying
these
people,
of
course
to
be
left
open
with
no
means
of
identifying
them
other
than
what
they
say
and
the
code
does
not
provide
for
any
affidavit
or
identity
as
some
states
seem
to
provide
for.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
the
courts
could
decide
that
it
was
applicable
on
both
on
the
statewide
level,
23
months,
on
the
municipal
level
for
23
months
and
there
would
be
no
cross
effect
between
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
they
have
decided
that,
but
i
think
that
we
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct,
but
we
have
also
the
problem
i
think
that
this
statute
and
this
case
points
out
and
that
is
that
there
are
just
a
few
areas
in
illinois
that
would
be
affected
by
this
statute
and
the
court
looking
at
it
today
might
well
decide
that
if
that
the
effect
is
not
as
--
you
have
raised
the
question
that
it
might
be
because
it
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
some
of
the
citizens
in
the
state
of
illinois.
i
don’t
know
that
the
illinois
--
what
the
illinois
courts
would
do,
but
i
think
that
it
is
a
question
that
should
be
left
to
the
illinois
courts
in
view
of
the
fact
that
illinois
is
mandated
by
the
constitution
to
care
on
elections.
i
think
it
is
mandated
to
protect
the
rights
of
citizens
who
participate
in
that
election
and
this
court
is
indicating
that
the
federal
courts
have
the
--
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
whether
the
states
of
procedure
for
carrying
on
the
elections
passed
constitutions
must
go.
i
think
to
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
raised
a
serious
questions
where
some
parts
of
the
state
of
illinois
have
to
live
with
the
effective
statute
like
this
and
other
areas
don’t,
just
because
the
major
political
parties
decide
to
put
forth
candidates
in
some
cities
and
not
in
others.
now
i
don’t
--
i’m
not
sure
that
what
my
position
would
be.
it
would
depend
on
i
think,
to
be
quite
candid,
the
side
that
i
was
on.
i
would
be
an
advocate
of
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
at
this
point,
we
would
make
an
effort
to
defend
the
statute
as
it
stands.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
no,
as
to
the
application
in
the
various
cities
where
the
major
parties
present.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that
is
correct.
they
only
ten
areas
to
board
of
elections
commissioners.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
would
find
no
difficulty
in
defending
the
statute.
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
urge
that
the
application
is
on
two
levels.
one
on
the
statewide
level
and
another
on
the
municipal
level
because
of
the
fact
that
all
of
the
political
parties
don’t
put
forth
candidates
at
both
levels,
at
the
municipal
level
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
no
sir.
but
i
think
that
the
court
below
has
in
considering
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
has
in
effect
just
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
legislators’
state
of
illinois.
i
think
that
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution
particularly
the
tenth
amendment
which
gives
to
the
state
the
right
to
carry
on
its
affairs
in
any
fashion
that
it
sees
fit
so
long
as
it
does
not
deny
to
the
people,
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution.
the
election
process,
i
think
on
the
basis
of
past
cases,
is
suspect
where
there
are
classifications
which
this
court
has
described
as
being
invidious.
and
i
think
that
most
of
these
have
been
on
racial
basis
or
geographical
basis
or
wealth
or
age
or
sex,
i
think
most
recently.
there
is
none
of
this
that’s
involved
in
this
case.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
if
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
is
whether
the
23
months
that
the
state
of
illinois
feels
is
a
proper
time
for
persons
to
be
identified
with
a
political
party
before
you
are
allowed
to
participate
in
the
primary
of
that
party
is
too
long.
i
think
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
decided
that
in
their
judgment,
it’s
necessary
to
have
this
length
of
time
or
some
length
of
time
and
the
23
months
becomes
a
convenient
time
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
only
have
elections
approximately
every
23
months
as
a
usual
matter
at
the
state
level.
but
this
is
a
reasonable
length
of
time
to
protect
the
identity
and
integrity
of
these
political
parties.
i
think
that
this
court
in
prior
cases
has
determined
that
protection
of
political
parties
is
a
matter
of
legitimate
state
concern
and
has
approved
means
of
protecting
those
parties.
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
would
suggest
that
the
23
months
is
too
long
whether
only
effect
of
that
23
months
would
be
that
the
participation
in
some
by
election
might
be
affected
by
that
23-month
rule.
it’s
only
in
the
case
of
a
special
election
that
that
would
be
effective.
if
the
court
construes
the
statute
as
being
a
limitation
on
participation
at
separate
levels
of
government,
i.e.
the
municipal
level
and
the
state
level
of
government.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
interest
of
the
state
would
be
served
by
12
months,
i
would
say
that
yes,
it
could
be.
but
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
so
limit
the
legislation
of
state
of
illinois.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
we
look
at
the
time
factor
in
terms
of
other
sections
of
the
code,
those
sections
that
require
it
to
be
a
candidate,
that
you
must
demonstrate
your
legions
to
a
party
for
a
period
of
24
months
prior
to
the
filing
date
of
your
nominating
papers,
for
periods
of
time
to
be
election
judges,
for
periods
of
time
to
be
signatories
on
nominating
petitions.
i
think
that
all
of
this
has
to
be
considered
in
considering
this
section
of
the
statute
which
only
serves
identification
does
not
change
the
other
sections
of
the
statute
which
have
these
requirements,
these
other
time
requirements.
they’re
just
not
involved
in
this
case,
but
they
are
affected
by
and
it
leads
the
election
code
in
illinois
somewhere
up
in
the
air
and
makes
it
quite
difficult
to
protect
the
right
of
these
people
who
cast
votes
and
protect
them
the
integrity
of
the
vote
and
the
integrity
of
the
election
process.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
no
sir.
i
think
that
this
is
a
matter
that
unless
the
court
finds
that
it
does
deprive
the
citizen
of
some
right,
which
is
in
some
significant
way,
it
should
not
interject
its
views
into
the
judgment
of
the
state
legislature
and
determine
this
time
that
they
feel
are
proper.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
would
have
problems
with
that,
but
that
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
here.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
would
agree.
if
that
would
be
the
case,
if
it
applies
to
municipal
elections.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
but
that
fact
is
an
accident,
because
it
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
it
assumed.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
in
the
case
before
the
court,
it
was
an
accident
that
this
could
be
raised.
if
the
case
had
been
filed
in
1973,
that
fact
could
not
have
been
stated
as,
could
that
have
been
alleged
truthfully.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
because
--
well,
we
do
not
have
a
municipal
election
until
1975
so
that
if
the
case
had
been
brought
this
year,
she
could
not
say
that
she
would
have
been
affected
and
i
don’t
think
that
she
would
have
been
entitled
in
your
list.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
four
years.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
every
two
years.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct.
that
is
--
you
think
in
the
new
election
code
that
will
be
changed.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
number
one,
it
will
make
all
the
elections
at
the
same
time,
the
same
period,
same
days
in
the
month.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
no
sir.
that
they
will
be
in
the
same
month
of
whatever
year
they
are
held.
right
now
that
even
that
is
different
so
that
the
23
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
is
it
difficult
to
change
it.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
it
does
not.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
board
of
election
commissioners
of
city
of
chicago.
our
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
decision
in
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court,
northern
district
illinois
finding
a
section
of
illinois
election
code
unconstitutional.
the
section
that’s
involved
is
chapter
46,
section
7-43
(d)
of
the
illinois
revised
statute.
that
section
provides
that
there
can
be
changes
in
participation
in
political
party
primaries,
only
if
23
months
has
elapsed
since
the
time
that
the
voter
has
last
participated
in
a
primary
election.
i
think
it’s
important
here
that
this
court
understand
that
the
territory
of
the
board
of
election
commissioners
of
city
of
chicago
encompasses
the
city
of
chicago
and
four
suburban
towns
at
the
time
that
this
case
came
to
the
court.
those
towns
were
the
towns
of
berwyn,
cicero,
stickney
and
lyons.
in
addition,
the
city
of
chicago
is
divided
into
50
wards
and
in
the
50
wards
and
the
four
suburban
towns,
there
are
approximately
3500
precincts.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
single
voter
from
the
36th
precinct
of
the
50th
ward
of
the
city
of
chicago,
who
brought
in
action
claiming
that
section
7-43
(d)
of
the
illinois
election
code
deprived
her
of
a
right
to
participate
in
the
primary
election
to
be
held
on
march
21,
1972.
she
filed
a
complaint
asking
that
section
7-43
be
declared
unconstitutional.
in
that
complaint,
she
alleged
that
she
had
voted
in
the
republican
primary
in
1971.
the
republican
party
primary
for
the
chicago
municipal
officers,
that
there
was
section
7-43
(d)
of
the
code
which
prohibited
her
from
voting
in
the
march
21,
1972
democratic
party
primary
election.
and
she
asked
the
court
to
find
that
that
section
deprived
her
of
rights
guaranteed
protected
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that
this
case
presents
two
basic
problems,
two
basic
differences
between
the
plaintiffs
or
appellants
here
and
the
defendant
--
the
defendants
were
appellants
here
and
the
plaintiffs.
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
courts,
the
federal
court
system
has
a
right
in
every
claim
made
by
a
voter
to
take
jurisdiction
and
to
decide
that
question
on
whether
or
not
the
federal
courts
are
limited
by
the
terms
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
particularly
the
tenth
amendment,
to
those
situations
in
which
that
is
a
demonstrated
interference
with
a
right
that
is
granted
by
some
other
section
of
the
constitution.
i
don’t
think
that
there’s
any
question
here
that
there
is
a
right
to
vote.
but
in
the
case
that’s
before
the
court,
the
claim
that
there
was
a
denial
by
any
section
of
the
illinois
election
code
is
erroneous.
what
mrs.
pontikes
complains
about
is
that
she
is
not
permitted
to
participate
in
primary
elections
and
she
sees
fit.
the
state
of
illinois
has
seen
fit
to
set
up
regulations
which
in
there
in
fact
as
to
protect
the
integrity
of
political
parties
and
it
is
not
just
the
integrity
of
the
democratic
and
republican
party,
but
it
is
designed
to
protect
the
integrity
of
any
political
group
which
comes
together
and
asserts
itself
under
the
terms
of
the
election
code.
the
complaint
that
mrs.
pontikes
brought,
we
believe
was
insufficient
to
ward
the
district
court
in
undertaking
to
hear
and
decide
the
case.
the
bare
on
its
face,
the
most
that
she
says
is
that
she
desires
to
participate
in
an
election,
a
democratic
party
primary
elections
and
that
the
section
of
the
statute
involved
here
would
prevent
her
doing
so.
i
think
that
a
look
at
the
statute
discloses
that
that
just
is
not
true.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice.
but
we
take
the
position
that
judge
marovitz
was
wrong
on
the
procedure.
this
was
a
case
that
should
never
in
which
a
three-judge
court
should
never
have
been
convoked
because
the
complaint
on
its
face
was
insufficient,
to
state
of
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
in
the
district
court.
there
is
certainly
no
claim
here
of
any
discrimination
by
the
illinois
election
code
between
the
plaintiff
and
any
other
citizen
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
there
is
no
claim
that
there
is
any
denial
of
due
process
as
might
have
been
involved
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
it’s
just
the
flat
assertion
that
she
will
not
be
permitted
to
participate
in
the
democratic
party
primary
in
1972.
that’s
statewide
because
she
had
participated
in
the
primary
election
for
republican
party
for
municipal
offices
in
the
prior
year
within
23
months
of
the
election
that
was
to
be
held
on
march
21,
1972.
i
think
that
there
were
a
series
of
problems
that
were
overlooked
by
the
judge
to
whom
the
case
was
originally
assigned.
even
if
you
get
passed
the
hurdle
of
whether
or
not
the
complaints’
states
of
claim
upon
which
relief
may
be
granted,
i
think
you
run
head
on
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
case
that
ought
to
be
heard
by
the
court.
in
illinois,
there
had
been
an
interpretation,
a
construction
of
the
statute
involved.
in
faherty
versus
board
of
election
commissioners
in
which
the
illinois
court
had
decided
that
participation
in
a
statewide
primary
would
determine
how
you
could
participate,
the
party’s
primary
that
you
could
participate
in
after
the
municipal
office
is
left.
now,
i
think
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
they
mentioned
that
they
did
not
believe
that
the
constitution
required
or
permitted
that
these
people,
that
citizens,
voters
be
locked
in
to
a
particular
political
party
at
every
level
of
government
or
at
every
level
of
politics.
we
do
not
argue
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
as
we
broke,
i
was
speaking
to
the
question
of
the
complaint
which
had
been
filed
by
mrs.
pontikes
in
the
case
at
bar.
i
had
just
suggested
that
she
had
not
made
any
allegations
in
that
complaint
indicating
that
she
claimed
any
denial
of
equal
protection
nor
had
she
made
any
claim
that
the
statute
denied
her
due
process
of
a
sort
that
the
court
had
spoken
to
in
william
versus
rhodes.
i
think
that
this,
the
fact
that
these
allegations
were
not
made,
very
serious
questions
as
to
her
standing
to
maintain
the
action.
i
think
that
the
court
for
quite
a
long
time
and
more
recently
in
jiggens
versus
mckeegan
(ph)
had
decided
that
unless
the
person
bringing
the
lawsuit
could
indicate
in
some
fashion
that
they
were
going
to
be
harmed
and
damaged
in
some
way
differently
from
the
way
in
which
the
other
members
of
the
community
would
be
harmed
by
the
statute
that
they
had
no
right
to
maintain
a
lawsuit.
i
think
that
all
of
these
are
questions
that
were
in
the
bosom
of
the
judge
to
whom
the
case
was
originally
assigned
in
the
district
court.
at
the
time
that
a
motion
was
made
to
convene
the
three-judge
court
pursuant
to
the
statute,
i
think
that
the
district
judge
at
that
point
did
not
carry
out
his
responsibility
on
the
laws,
the
rules
and
the
law
by
searching
this
complaint
and
deciding
all
of
these
questions
before
convoking
that
three-judge
court,
before
asking
the
chief
judge
of
the
seventh
circuit
to
convoke
that
three-judge
court.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
think
that
--
well
they
allude
to
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
though
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
we
have
raised
this
in
the
section
of
the
brief
where
we
suggest
that
the
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well
i
think
this
is
necessarily
included
in
the
questions
that
we
presented
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
i
think
that
the
rules
provide
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
but
i
think
that
the
jurisdictional
questions
are
questions
that
were
necessarily
included
in
any
question
that
is
presented
in
this
court
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
this
court
has
determined
that
it
has
the
right
to
look
at
that
question
and
to
decide
that
question
no
matter
what
other
questions
might
have
been
raised
by
the
parties.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
would
take
note
and
do
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
on
pager
4,
we
did
set
out
the
questions.
but
we
thought
that
those
are
necessarily
included
in
the
questions
that
we
had
set
out
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
i
think
that
once
the
question
of
the
three-judge
court
had
been
presented
to
the
district
judge
and
the
court
had
been
convened
that
there
were
two
questions
that
faced
both
the
district
judge
before
the
court
is
convened
and
the
court
at
the
time
it
was
sitting
and
that
was
whether
or
not
this
was
the
sort
of
question
that
the
statute
2281
had
considered
to
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court
whether
or
not
this
was
a
local
question
which
should
be
decided
by
a
single
judge.
and
if
that
question
was
answered
in
the
affirmative,
it
was
a
local
matter.
the
three-judge
court
should
have
returned
the
matter
to
a
single
judge.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
single
individual
who
is
a
resident
of
one
precinct
out
of
some
3500
precincts
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
who
claims
to
be
affected
by
statute
which
on
its
face
seems
to
show
that
there
are
some
areas
in
the
state
of
illinois
which
will
not
be
affected
by
the
terms
of
that
statute.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
of
election
commissioners
in
this
case
is
limited
to
the
city
of
chicago.
the
other
areas
in
the
county
of
cook
do
not
have
the
republican
and
democratic
parties
presenting
candidates
for
election,
for
municipal
office
and
we
suggest
that
in
that
circumstance
that
this
is
the
local
situation,
that
is
not
included
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
statutory
three-judge
court.
but
i
think
even
more
important,
even
if
there
is
jurisdiction,
i
think
the
court
faces
a
further
problem
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
should
hear
and
decide
the
particular
case
that
it
is
presented
with.
we
would
suggest
here
that
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
not
considered
this
statute
on
the
factual
situation
that
was
presented
in
this
case,
that
this
was
a
proper
case
before
the
court
not
to
construe
that
statute,
but
to
allow
the
illinois
courts
to
construe
it.
the
illinois
court
had
considered
the
case
--
considered
the
statute
in
the
case
of
faherty
versus
the
board
of
election
commissioners
in
the
city
of
chicago
in
determining
whether
or
not
participation
at
the
statewide
primary
level
would
determine
the
political
party
primary
that
a
voter
could
participate
in,
in
the
municipal
offices
primary.
they
had
decided
that
it
did.
we
suggest
that
that
decision
does
not
--
is
not
a
decision
or
an
indication
that
it
would
decide
the
adverse
of
that
question
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
participation
in
a
municipal
primary
which
mrs.
pontikes
alleged
here
also
prevents
a
change
in
political
party
primary
when
the
statewide
primary
is
being
held.
these
are
questions
that
should
be
left
to
the
illinois
courts.
i
think
that
the
court
has
in
numerous
cases
decided
that
where
a
statute
is
capable
of
a
construction
which
would
prevent
the
statute
from
being
determined
to
be
unconstitutional
that
the
presumption
should
be
that
it
will
be
construed
in
that
fashion
and
the
courts
that
were
primarily
concerned
with
the
statutory
construction
should
be
allowed
to
construe
the
statute.
it
was
not
done
in
this
case
though
there
is
a
ready
means
of
that
in
the
state
of
illinois
because
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
statute
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
decided
that
election
matters
or
matters
which
can
be
determined
under
that
declaratory
judgment
action
or
declaratory
judgment
statute
and
under
that
statute,
declaratory
judgment
matters
were
given
preference
over
other
matters
that
are
pending
in
the
courts.
so
that
this
could
have
been
quite
rapidly
done
probably
in
time
for
a
decision
to
have
been
made
on
the
construction
to
be
given
to
that
statute
before
the
election
in
all
probability
in
time
for
the
federal
court
to
have
considered
the
matter
if
the
plaintiff
felt
that
the
construction
was
erroneous
and
left
open
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
was
constitutionally
deficient.
we
think
that
in
these
circumstances,
the
court
should
have
abstained
and
that
the
matter
should
be
returned
to
the
illinois
courts
so
that
they
might
consider
the
statute
rather
than
having
to
live
with
an
interpretation
by
a
federal
court
which
is
not
used
to
dealing
with
vagaries
of
the
illinois
election
code.
the
statute
here
is
a
part
of
an
integrated
scheme
for
carrying
on
elections
and
on
numerous
other
aspects
of
the
elections
--
of
the
election
code
that
are
affected
by
a
decision
that
section
7-43
(d)
of
the
illinois
election
code
is
unconstitutional.
we
have
the
matter
of
determining
who
will
participate
in
the
election
as
election
judges,
who
can
be
canvassers?
who
can
sign
nominating
petitions
and
that
sort
of
thing
with
no
provision
for
identifying
these
people,
of
course
to
be
left
open
with
no
means
of
identifying
them
other
than
what
they
say
and
the
code
does
not
provide
for
any
affidavit
or
identity
as
some
states
seem
to
provide
for.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
the
courts
could
decide
that
it
was
applicable
on
both
on
the
statewide
level,
23
months,
on
the
municipal
level
for
23
months
and
there
would
be
no
cross
effect
between
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
they
have
decided
that,
but
i
think
that
we
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct,
but
we
have
also
the
problem
i
think
that
this
statute
and
this
case
points
out
and
that
is
that
there
are
just
a
few
areas
in
illinois
that
would
be
affected
by
this
statute
and
the
court
looking
at
it
today
might
well
decide
that
if
that
the
effect
is
not
as
--
you
have
raised
the
question
that
it
might
be
because
it
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
some
of
the
citizens
in
the
state
of
illinois.
i
don’t
know
that
the
illinois
--
what
the
illinois
courts
would
do,
but
i
think
that
it
is
a
question
that
should
be
left
to
the
illinois
courts
in
view
of
the
fact
that
illinois
is
mandated
by
the
constitution
to
care
on
elections.
i
think
it
is
mandated
to
protect
the
rights
of
citizens
who
participate
in
that
election
and
this
court
is
indicating
that
the
federal
courts
have
the
--
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
whether
the
states
of
procedure
for
carrying
on
the
elections
passed
constitutions
must
go.
i
think
to
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
raised
a
serious
questions
where
some
parts
of
the
state
of
illinois
have
to
live
with
the
effective
statute
like
this
and
other
areas
don’t,
just
because
the
major
political
parties
decide
to
put
forth
candidates
in
some
cities
and
not
in
others.
now
i
don’t
--
i’m
not
sure
that
what
my
position
would
be.
it
would
depend
on
i
think,
to
be
quite
candid,
the
side
that
i
was
on.
i
would
be
an
advocate
of
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
at
this
point,
we
would
make
an
effort
to
defend
the
statute
as
it
stands.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
no,
as
to
the
application
in
the
various
cities
where
the
major
parties
present.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
it
is.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that
is
correct.
they
only
ten
areas
to
board
of
elections
commissioners.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
would
find
no
difficulty
in
defending
the
statute.
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
urge
that
the
application
is
on
two
levels.
one
on
the
statewide
level
and
another
on
the
municipal
level
because
of
the
fact
that
all
of
the
political
parties
don’t
put
forth
candidates
at
both
levels,
at
the
municipal
level
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
no
sir.
but
i
think
that
the
court
below
has
in
considering
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
has
in
effect
just
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
legislators’
state
of
illinois.
i
think
that
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution
particularly
the
tenth
amendment
which
gives
to
the
state
the
right
to
carry
on
its
affairs
in
any
fashion
that
it
sees
fit
so
long
as
it
does
not
deny
to
the
people,
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution.
the
election
process,
i
think
on
the
basis
of
past
cases,
is
suspect
where
there
are
classifications
which
this
court
has
described
as
being
invidious.
and
i
think
that
most
of
these
have
been
on
racial
basis
or
geographical
basis
or
wealth
or
age
or
sex,
i
think
most
recently.
there
is
none
of
this
that’s
involved
in
this
case.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
if
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
is
whether
the
23
months
that
the
state
of
illinois
feels
is
a
proper
time
for
persons
to
be
identified
with
a
political
party
before
you
are
allowed
to
participate
in
the
primary
of
that
party
is
too
long.
i
think
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
decided
that
in
their
judgment,
it’s
necessary
to
have
this
length
of
time
or
some
length
of
time
and
the
23
months
becomes
a
convenient
time
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
only
have
elections
approximately
every
23
months
as
a
usual
matter
at
the
state
level.
but
this
is
a
reasonable
length
of
time
to
protect
the
identity
and
integrity
of
these
political
parties.
i
think
that
this
court
in
prior
cases
has
determined
that
protection
of
political
parties
is
a
matter
of
legitimate
state
concern
and
has
approved
means
of
protecting
those
parties.
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
would
suggest
that
the
23
months
is
too
long
whether
only
effect
of
that
23
months
would
be
that
the
participation
in
some
by
election
might
be
affected
by
that
23-month
rule.
it’s
only
in
the
case
of
a
special
election
that
that
would
be
effective.
if
the
court
construes
the
statute
as
being
a
limitation
on
participation
at
separate
levels
of
government,
i.e.
the
municipal
level
and
the
state
level
of
government.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
interest
of
the
state
would
be
served
by
12
months,
i
would
say
that
yes,
it
could
be.
but
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
so
limit
the
legislation
of
state
of
illinois.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
we
look
at
the
time
factor
in
terms
of
other
sections
of
the
code,
those
sections
that
require
it
to
be
a
candidate,
that
you
must
demonstrate
your
legions
to
a
party
for
a
period
of
24
months
prior
to
the
filing
date
of
your
nominating
papers,
for
periods
of
time
to
be
election
judges,
for
periods
of
time
to
be
signatories
on
nominating
petitions.
i
think
that
all
of
this
has
to
be
considered
in
considering
this
section
of
the
statute
which
only
serves
identification
does
not
change
the
other
sections
of
the
statute
which
have
these
requirements,
these
other
time
requirements.
they’re
just
not
involved
in
this
case,
but
they
are
affected
by
and
it
leads
the
election
code
in
illinois
somewhere
up
in
the
air
and
makes
it
quite
difficult
to
protect
the
right
of
these
people
who
cast
votes
and
protect
them
the
integrity
of
the
vote
and
the
integrity
of
the
election
process.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
no
sir.
i
think
that
this
is
a
matter
that
unless
the
court
finds
that
it
does
deprive
the
citizen
of
some
right,
which
is
in
some
significant
way,
it
should
not
interject
its
views
into
the
judgment
of
the
state
legislature
and
determine
this
time
that
they
feel
are
proper.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
would
have
problems
with
that,
but
that
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
here.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
i
would
agree.
if
that
would
be
the
case,
if
it
applies
to
municipal
elections.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
but
that
fact
is
an
accident,
because
it
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
it
assumed.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
in
the
case
before
the
court,
it
was
an
accident
that
this
could
be
raised.
if
the
case
had
been
filed
in
1973,
that
fact
could
not
have
been
stated
as,
could
that
have
been
alleged
truthfully.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
because
--
well,
we
do
not
have
a
municipal
election
until
1975
so
that
if
the
case
had
been
brought
this
year,
she
could
not
say
that
she
would
have
been
affected
and
i
don’t
think
that
she
would
have
been
entitled
in
your
list.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
four
years.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
every
two
years.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct.
that
is
--
you
think
in
the
new
election
code
that
will
be
changed.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
well,
number
one,
it
will
make
all
the
elections
at
the
same
time,
the
same
period,
same
days
in
the
month.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
no
sir.
that
they
will
be
in
the
same
month
of
whatever
year
they
are
held.
right
now
that
even
that
is
different
so
that
the
23
--
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
is
it
difficult
to
change
it.
mr.
aldus
s.
mitchell,
jr.
it
does
not.
