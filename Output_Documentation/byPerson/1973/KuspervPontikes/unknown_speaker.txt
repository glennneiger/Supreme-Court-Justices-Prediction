unknown
speaker
you
did
set
the
matter
on
page
4
of
your
brief
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
your
position
on
the
merits,
in
the
state
courts
or
in
this
court
as
to
whether
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
of
the
states
position.
unknown
speaker
as
a
statewide
application?
unknown
speaker
now
there
was
unlimited
application
in
the
sections
of
the
state,
is
that
a
position
stated?
the
statute
is
of
limited
application
at
particular
sections
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
and
your
argument
then
is
that
not
being
a
statewide
application.
it’s
not
a
case
for
a
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
it
was
served.
if
in
some
manner,
we
reached
the
merits
here
or
if
it
were
referred
to
a
state
court
and
you
had
to
take
the
position
on
the
merits.
would
you
find
it
difficult,
would
the
state
find
it
difficult
to
defend
the
statute
as
a
it
is
written
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
try
to
defend
it
if
in
fact
it’s
to
be
read
as
having
limited
application,
only
the
certain
sections
of
the
state.
this
23-months
prior,
would
you
try
to
defend
that
against
an
equal
protection
challenge?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mitchell,
does
the
fact
that
the
statute
could
be
more
narrowly
drawn,
meaning
that
it
is
necessarily
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
what
if
in
order
to
change
parties
it
was
essential.
the
period
was
so
long,
the
waiting
period
was
so
long
that
you
would
have
to
miss
the
primary?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
is,
it
is
that
it
applies
--
that
this
applies
to
municipal
elections.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
reached
that
way
on
spaces.
unknown
speaker
and
the
three-judges
didn’t
--
didn’t
this
come
from
the
three
judge
court?
unknown
speaker
then
the
three-judge
court
assume
or
hold
that
it
applied
this
municipal
election?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
does,
you
concede
you
have
a
problem
with
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
municipal
primaries
are
every?
unknown
speaker
every
four
years
and
the
statewide
primaries
are
every
two
years?
unknown
speaker
but
they
don’t
concur
in
the
same
year
that
is
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
but
how
is
it
going
to
be
changed?
right
now,
the
municipal
elections
are
off
year,
that
is
after
even
numbered
years
for
the
statewide
primaries.
it’s
odd
number
years
when
you
have
a
municipal
primary.
unknown
speaker
and
how
is
the
new
election
code
going
to
change
that?
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words,
they
will
all
be
in
the
same
primaries
whether
municipal
or
statewide
all
be
in
the
same
year?
unknown
speaker
will
the
new
code
change
the
23
months
requirement?
unknown
speaker
no
does
the
new
code
change
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
to
say
that
municipal
primaries
are
all
on
the
same
date
throughout
the
state,
wherever
a
municipality
has
a
primary?
unknown
speaker
those
were
general
elections?
unknown
speaker
oh
i
know
but
it
wasn’t
a
primary.
unknown
speaker
in
the
municipal
primary.
unknown
speaker
she
had
voted
in
the
statewide.
unknown
speaker
as
a
republican
or
whatever
it
was
in
the
municipal
and
the
court
said
in
farherty,
“no,
you
can’t
because
of
the
statute.”
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
see,
are
you
suggesting
that
no
matter
what
differences
there
maybe
in
the
dates
on
which
municipal
primaries
are
held,
this
statute
would
disqualify
any
one
who
voted
in
the
statewide
primary
from
voting
in
any
municipal
primary
for
23
months.
unknown
speaker
in
the
opposite
primary.
unknown
speaker
what
state
was
this?
unknown
speaker
three-judge
court
also?
unknown
speaker
let
us
see,
you
mean
in
south
carolina,
are
you
suggesting
it’s
exactly
like
the
illinois
statute
except
that
the
time
stated
is
very
short?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
you
are
not
here
before
us
challenging
the
validity
in
any
part
of
section
7
43
(d).
unknown
speaker
but
actual
candidates
had
been
concerned
about
this.
is
this
not
so,
in
your
area
of
the
country?
unknown
speaker
i
recall
senator
humphrey
making
this
statement
every
two
years
in
primary
as
in
states
i
am
familiar
with,
wisconsin
and
minnesota.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
they
were
complaining
about.
unknown
speaker
how
long
was
the
problem
affected
illinois?
unknown
speaker
i
am
still
not
clear
how
you
distinguished
this
courts
decision
on
chipalone
and
that's
the
way
it
is
pronounced.
unknown
speaker
yes.
1972.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
it
is
a
constitutional
argument?
unknown
speaker
there
is
case
such
as
williams
against
rhodes
and
jenness
against
fortson
and
so
on
dealt
expressly
with
the
so-called
right
to
be
a
candidate
and
as
i
remember,
it
did
not
denigrate
that
right
below
that
voting,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
for
four
years?
unknown
speaker
and
but
he
can’t
run
on
a
different
party
if
he
has
voted
on
another
party
--
voted
in
another’s
party
primary
within
the
last
four-year
period.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
affirmed
by
this
court
but
that
is
two
years
ago.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
some
question.
unknown
speaker
in
your
case
would
you
find
any
different
between
the
validity
of
the
statute
as
it
applies
to
state
election
and
as
it
applies
to
federal?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
the
state
may
no
more
qualify
the
person’s
right
to
be
in
a
state
primary
than
in
the
federal
primary?
unknown
speaker
the
right
to
vote
in
state
election,
you
wouldn’t
argue
it
here
to
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well
then
in
clearly
going,
are
you
saying
that
the
federal
of
the
state
elections
in
this
case,
stand
on
the
same
footing
as
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
--unaffected
by
the
constitutionally
guaranteed.
unknown

you
