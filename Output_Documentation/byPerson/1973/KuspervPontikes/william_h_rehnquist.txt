i
can
see
that

i
was
pressured
whether
that
statement
when
you

case

what’s
the
difference
between
locking
yourself
in
by
registration
and
locking
yourself
in
by
voting?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
suffrage
amendment
doesn’t
say
women
shall
have
the
right
to
vote.
it
says
they
chancefully
denied
the
right
to
vote
by
reason
of
their
sex.
it
doesn’t
confirm
or
affirm
that
the
right
to
vote.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr
cohen,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
could
make
the
argument
--
with
which
for
some
reason
exactly
contrary
to
what
was
you
are
saying
but
if
party
raiding
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
that
there
is
more
to
worry
about
in
terms
of
party
raiding,
in
terms
of
voter
cross
over
than
there
is
in
terms
of
candidate
cross
over
that
you
could
have
candidates
crossing
over
without
running
any
real
risk
of
party
raiding
whereas
if
you
have
voters
crossing
over,
you
do
have
a
risk
of
raiding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
judgment
that
cites
an
article
in
the
tribune
or
the
daily
news
urging
the
republicans
to
cross
over
and
vote
in
the
democratic
primary
but
he
thought
it
was
real.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you’re
talking
about
two
states
that
have
very
notoriously
weak
party
structures,
wisconsin
and
minnesota
where
there
have
been
the
third
party
elements.
that
may
be
permissible
as
a
matter
of
political
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
but
i
would
think
that
if
the
illinois
legislature
decide
it
wants
to
strengthen
the
two-party
system,
it
isn’t
required
to
apply
the
practice
that
wisconsin
and
minnesota
have
applied
perhaps
to
get
different
results.
