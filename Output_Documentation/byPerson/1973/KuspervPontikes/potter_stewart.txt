justice
potter
stewart
the
complaint
seems
to
mention
only
the
alleged
right
to
be
free
from
the
invasion
of
privacy
allegedly
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
all.
the
right
to
be
free
from
an
invasion
of
privacy
protected,
allegedly
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
all
that
there
is
the
complainant,
isn’t
it,
so
far
as
the
federal
constitution
goes?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mitchell
you’re
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
illinois
courts
have
held
that
this
statute
is
applicable
to
somebody
who
has
voted
in
a
one
party
primary
and
a
state
primary
and
now
wants
to
go
in
a
different
party
primary
in
a
municipal
election
that
it
is
applicable
but
you
used
to
tell
us
i
think
that
the
illinois
courts
have
not
decided
the
opposite
side
of
the
coin
which
is
presented
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
at
least
arguably
the
illinois
courts
might
decide
that
this
statute
is
not
applicable
to
this
kind
of
a
--
the
situation
that
this
plaintiff
found
or
something.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
courts
have
already
decided
there
is
a
cross
effect
when
you
go
from
state
to
municipal
has
it
not?
or
did
i
misunderstand?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
haven’t
decided
whether
there
is
a
cross
effect
when
you
go
from
municipal
to
state.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
lipitt
case
is
a
decision
of
this
court
on
the
merits?
and
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
four-year,
that
was
a
four-year
interval.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
wished.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
how
constitutionally
is
that
different?
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
man
just
wanted
to
change
once.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
didn’t
want
to
change
back
and
forth
and
back
and
forth
of
course
as
far
as
we
know
is
he
--
had
been
a
republican
now
he
wants
to
change
to
the
american
independent
party.
he
voted
there
as
a
republican
in
the
1970
ohio
primary
election
and
now
in
1972,he
wants
to
run
as
a
candidate
of
the
american
independent
party
and
there
is
an
ohio
statutes
that
says
he
can’t
do
that
for
four
years.
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
do
you
find
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
about
in
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
obviously
it’s
a
difference
but
what
is
the
--
why
does
one
have
a
superior
constitutional
position
than
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
why
does
either
have
a
constitution
position
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
you
get
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
will
protect
that
activity
as
any
activity
against
the
valid
claim
of
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
but
that
is
something
else
again
that
will
protect
your
right
to
cross
the
street
against
that
kind
of
a
valid
claim.
that
does
not
mean
the
right
to
cross
the
street
is
necessarily
unconstitutional
against
the
red
light
is
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
called
minor
against
happersett
and
that’s
in
this
court
in
which
you
can
find
the
statement
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
vote.
that’s
the
case
in
which
women
tried
to
save
--
the
constitution
gave
her
a
right
to
vote
she
would
accept
her
bid
–
fact
of
being
a
woman,
she
was
equally
well
qualified
in
the
state
and
to
vote.
and
in
this
court
said
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
vote
and
that
is
of
course
but
what
led
to
the
amendment
of
the
constitution
that
gave
the
women
the
right
to
vote.
so,
now
there
is
an
equal
right
of
women
to
vote
with
men
but
that
decision
still
stands.
i
suppose
that
there
is
not
a
constitution
right
to
vote,
that’s
the
case
of
minor
against
happersett.
justice
potter
stewart
well
of
course
the
constitution
predated
even
that.
justice
potter
stewart
it
confirms
just
a
specific
equal
protection
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
there
are
those
who
say
you
have
disaster
area
there
for
all
that
period
but
there
might
be
others
who
would
disagree.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
get
this
hierarchy
of
these
two
supposed
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
the
right
to
vote
is
somehow
the
right
as
you
call
it
to
vote.
one
would
argue
about
whether
or
not
there
is
a
right
to
vote
but
in
any
event,
that
voting
is
superior
somehow
or
another--
justice
potter
stewart
--to
being
a
candidate.
justice
potter
stewart
once
you
derive
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
sorry,
excuse
me,
i
did
not
know
i
was
interrupting
justice.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
says
more
than
that,
doesn’t
it?
doesn’t
it
say
the
state
shall
set
the
qualifications
for
those
who
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
before
i
announce
that
opinion
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
has
something
to
add.
justice
potter
stewart
the
opinion
i
am
authorized
to
announce
this
morning
is
in
number
71-1631,
stanley
p
kusper
jr.
and
others,
appellants
against
harriet
g.
pontikes,
appellee
in
a
case
which
is
here
on
appeals
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
under
a
provision
of
the
illinois
election
code
a
person
is
prohibited
from
voting
in
a
primary
election
of
a
political
party,
if
he
has
voted
in
the
primary
of
any
other
party
within
the
preceding
23
months.
the
appellee
harriet
g.
pontikes
is
a
qualified
chicago
voter
who
voted
in
a
republican
primary
in
february
of
1971.
she
wanted
to
vote
in
march
1972,
democratic
primary,
but
was
bared
from
doing
so
by
this
23-months
rule.
she
filed
a
complain
for
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
in
united
state's
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
alleging
that
the
illinois
law
unconstitutionally
abridged
her
freedom
to
associate
with
the
political
party
of
her
choice
by
depriving
her
of
the
opportunity
to
vote
in
the
democratic
primary.
a
statutory,
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
that
court
held,
one
judge
dissenting
that
the
23-months
rule
is
unconstitutional.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
from
that
judgment.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail
in
the
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
this
provision
of
illinois
election
code
unconstitutionally
infringes
upon
the
right
of
free
political
association,
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
accordingly
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
concurs
in
the
result
and
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
justice
potter
stewart
the
complaint
seems
to
mention
only
the
alleged
right
to
be
free
from
the
invasion
of
privacy
allegedly
protected

is
that
right?
justice

that’s
all.
the

and
there
is
an

statutes
that
says
he
can’t

that
for
four

justice

stewart
and
where
do
you
find
that?
justice

stewart
yes.
justice

but
how
about
in

justice

obviously
it’s
