mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
cover
the
history
and
the
chronology
of
the
elections
since
this
has
been
raised.
first
of
all,
the
new
election
code
has
not
passed
the
general
assembly
yet.
secondly,
we
have
municipal
elections
in
different
municipalities,
at
the
same
time
we
have
them
in
chicago
and
they
are
partisan
elections
where
there
is
the
democratic
party
and
the
republican
party
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
no,
but
many
are
of
the
same
date.
going
back
historically,
in
april
of
1968,
certain
of
the
102
counties
in
the
state
of
illinois
had
primaries
where
candidates
were
running
in
the
democratic
and
republican
primary.
in
june
of
1968,
there
was
a
statewide
primary
that
was
before
the
time
and
that
was
not
changed.
in
october
of
1969,
there
was
a
special
congressional
election
which
affected
124
of
the
voters
of
the
state
after
congressman
rumsfeld
was
appointed
to
the
federal
position
by
president
nixon.
in
march
of
1970,
there
was
statewide
primary
with
the
new
change,
changing
it
from
june
to
march.
in
february
of
1971,
city
of
chicago,
city
of
waukegan
which
i
believe
is
about
the
5th
or
6th
largest
municipality
in
the
state
and
several
other
municipalities
held
their
primary
where
democratic
and
republican
parties
filled
with
candidates.
march
of
1972
was
the
state
primary
which
was
in
question
here.
in
april
of
1972,
there
were
again
county
elections
in
certain
--
county
primaries
excuse
me,
in
certain
of
the
counties
in
the
state
including
dupage
county
which
is
the
second
largest
county
in
the
state.
in
april
of
1972
--
excuse
me,
in
june
of
1973,
there
was
a
special
congressional
election
in
the
city
of
chicago
which
included
the
town
of
berwyn
which
is
a
part
of
chicago
board
of
election
commissioners
to
fill
the
vacancy
created
by
the
death
of
congressman
collin.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
no,
sir.
in
june
of
1973
was
the
special
congressional
election
on
june
5th.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it
was
a
special
primary,
i
am
sorry,
sir.
june
5th
was
the
special
primary.
july
3rd
was
the
special
election.
and
again,
in
march
of
1974,
the
statewide
primary
was
scheduled
and
on
february
of
1975
will
be
the
municipal
primary
in
chicago
and
hundreds
of
other
municipalities
throughout
the
state.
so,
the
idea
that
this
does
not
have
statewide
effect
simply
isn’t
so.
as
i
read
the
faherty
case,
what
the
court
was
asked
then
was
--
by
the
plaintiff,
does
this
statute
apply
to
me?
will
this
bar
me
from
changing
party
affiliation
in
the
primary
and
the
court
said
yes.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
in
the
municipal
primary,
yes
sir.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
voted
in
the
statewide
primary
in
1954
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
exactly,
and
even
the
dissent
of
judge
marovitz
where
he
disagreed
with
the
finding
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
did
not
rest
it
on
the
fact
that
it
is
a
municipal
primary
but
simply
rested
it
on
the
fact
of
compelling
state
interest
which
was
raised
at
some
link
in
the
brief.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
it
was
applied
statewide.
the
board
of
election
commissioners
issued
a
document
which
went
out
to
every
election
judge
in
the
3500
precincts
advising
them
that
the
23-month
rule
was
not
in
effect.
they
had
a
banner
which
was
about
this
long
which
was
placed
over
the
section
of
the
poster
which
stated
eligibility
to
vote,
which
changed
that
since
the
decision
came
so
soon
before
the
election.
it
was
given
statewide
effect.
as
it’s
pointed
in
page
13
of
the
appellees
brief,
the
board
of
election
commissioners
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
maintaining
the
election
code
within
their
jurisdiction.
there
are
103
jurisdictions
for
elections
under
the
current
election
code,
two
within
cook
county,
the
board
of
election
commissioners
and
the
county
handles
the
rest
of
the
area
and
then
each
of
the
other
101
counties
handled
their
own
election.
so,
they
each
having
election
officer
who
handles
it
and
they
must
handle
it,
of
course,
in
the
same
way.
so,
there
is
a
statewide
effect
to
it
and
i’m
certain
that
no
one
would
say
that
someone
could
have
one
right
to
vote
in
chicago
and
another
right
somewhere
else
in
the
state
based
on
the
same
statute.
i
think
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
in
the
opposite
primary.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
absolutely.
of
course,
and
what
i
attempted
to
pointed
out
with
the
dates
and
i
hope
i
didn’t
confuse
rather
than
eliminate
was
that
there
were
almost
always
be
two
elections
within
a
23-month
period.
so,
very
frequently
rather
than
very
rarely,
well
you
have
to
forfeit
your
right
to
vote
in
one
election
to
vote
in
another.
and
think
counsel's
use
of
the
term,
“participate
in
a
primary”
is
really
a
misnomer
because
you
are
voting
in
a
primary.
i
would
probably
exhaust
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
recited
the
citations
of
the
cases
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
your
right
to
vote
in
the
primary
is
a
sacrosanct
as
your
right
to
vote
in
a
general
election.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it
would
not
be
my
reading
of
illinois
electoral
history
that
that
would
be
so.
the
city
of
chicago
has
elected
the
democratic
american
consistently
since
1931.
there
are
less
than
five
republican
candidates
that
ever
carried
the
city
in
any
election
at
any
time
on
a
state
or
national
basis
since
then.
likewise,
there
are
other
counties
that
have
not
--
that
are
traditionally
republican
both
at
the
local
level
and
at
the
national
level.
so,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
consistency
in
the
state
of
illinois.
now,
i
am
not
as
familiar
of
course
with
other
areas.
i
think
what
we
held
when
we
get
to
the
middle
of
this
issue
is
a
conflict
in
rights.
we
recognized
the
right
of
a
state
to
regulate
elections,
the
right
of
the
state
to
protect
with
limitations,
party
integrity.
but
we
also
recognized
the
right
to
vote
and
it’s
alleged
in
the
complaint
in
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint
which
is
found
at
page
4
of
the
appendix
that
plaintiff
has
been
denied
her
right
to
vote
by
the
application
of
this
statute.
we
say
that
this
right,
this
right
to
vote
must
be
held
superior
to
the
right
to
protect
party
integrity.
in
a
case,
which
to
the
untrained
eye,
it
might
seem
controlling
in
this
case.
i
think
the
court
anticipated
that
in
rosario.
the
rosario
decision
which
interestingly
was
decided
one
year
to
the
date
after
the
primary
which
was
affected
by
our
case
stated
that
the
new
york
registration
statute
was
valid.
it
was
valid
to
require
one,
to
register
some
8
to
11
months
prior
to
a
primary
in
which
primary
he
was
going
to
vote
but
the
majority
said
in
that
case
that
this
was
not
“locking
in”
and
that’s
the
language
that’s
used
in
that
93
supreme
court
page
1250,
thus
new
york
scheme
does
not
lack
a
voter
in
to
an
unwanted
preexisting
party
affiliation
from
one
primary
to
the
next.
all
that
the
voter
had
to
do
in
that
case
if
he
wished
to
vote
in
the
primary
of
his
choice
was
simply
register
8
to
11
months
beforehand.
there
are
many
other
states
which
has
registration
requirements.
california
requirement
which
was
by
statute
56
days
has
just
been
reduced
by
court
to
30
days
in
the
case
of
gonass
(ph)
versus
young
which
i
believed
certiorari
was
denied
on
although
i
don’t
have
the
citation
with
me.
in
california,
you
register
at
the
time
you
vote
as
either
a
democrat
or
a
republican
or
you
register
as
unaffiliated.
you
cannot
vote
in
a
primary
unless
you
are
registered
in
that
party
but
you
can
change
your
affiliation
or
you
can
register
affiliation
at
any
time
up
to
now
30
days
beforehand.
so,
there
you
have
the
chance
to
formidably
do
something
your
self
to
enable
you
to
vote.
in
the
pontikes
case,
under
illinois
law,
the
only
way
you
can
qualify
to
vote
--
the
democratic
primary
at
one
point
is
if
you
did
not
vote
in
the
republican
primary
23
months
beforehand.
so,
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
will
in
effect
disenfranchise
you
at
any
election
in
the
succeeding
23
months
or
you
might
wish
to
vote
for
or
against
candidates
in
the
other
primary
which
is
your
right.
there
was
one
case
on
a
very
similar
statute
which
was
decided
before
our
case
and
there
were
two
cases
subsequent.
in
the
prior
case,
gordon
versus
executive
committee
of
charleston
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
there
was
in
a
set
--
a
calendar
year
requirement.
you
had
to
sign
an
affidavit
that
you
have
not
voted
in
the
opposite
party
primary
within
that
year.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
this
was
in
south
carolina.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
three-judge
court
and
there
the
court
--
unfortunately,
i
am
reading
from
a
slipped
opinion
that
i
have
been
using
for
the
last
two
years
and
it’s
on
page
5.
i
can’t
give
you
the
citated
page.
the
court
said,
“no
sound
or
compelling
purpose
can
possibly
justify
locking
a
citizen
into
a
party
and
denying
to
him
for
a
full
year
freedom
to
change
parties.
such
an
arbitrary
restrained
upon
the
voter
is
both
unreasonable
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
yes,
i’m
not
asking
the
court
to
disapprove
or
overrule
rosario.
i
think
that
the
majority
of
opinion
almost
anticipated
these
cases
in
rosario
when
they
went
on
to
say
that
the
reason
the
person
was
denied
the
right
to
vote
was
not
the
statute
but
his
own
forbearance
for
doing
the
simply
act
of
registration.
he
was
not
losing
the
right
to
vote
because
of
the
way
he
voted
before.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
right.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
but
in
new
york
if
he
had
voted
in
a
primary
in
the
democrat
party
for
example,
in
1970
he
could
have
up
until
8
or
11
months
or
whatever
the
exact
figure
was
prior
to
the
next
election,
changes
registration
and
register
in
the
liberal
party
of
the
conservative
or
the
republican
and
i
think
this
was
pointed
out
by
the
majority
and
i
think
that’s
why
the
rosario
decision
differs
here
and
that’s
why
it
is
not
inconsistent
to
hold,
to
affirm
in
this
case
despite
rosario.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
here
again,
they’re
talking
about
“locking
in”
and
the
locking
in
implies
and
it’s
used
in
these
cases
and
is
used
over
and
over
again,
that
you
lock
yourself
in,
not
by
registration
but
by
voting
and
that’s
where
the
difference
is.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
the
time
period
is
different.
it
is
a
calendar
year
as
suppose
to
12
months
or
another
period.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
because
i
can
see
where
registration
serves
a
useful
purpose.
in
illinois,
i
assume
in
other
states,
administrative
bodies
are
pointed
often
by
political
affiliation.
you
may
have
no
more
than
two
members
from
each
political
party
or
more
than
three
members.
so,
it’s
important
to
know
what
political
party
somebody
belongs
to
so
you
know
if
he
is
eligible
to
hold
an
office
but
voting
should
not
be
the
determining
factor
in
establishing
a
person’s
affiliation
because
this
is
something
that
changes.
you
can
change
registration.
in
new
york,
you
could
have
conceivably
changed
your
registration
since
the
last
primary,
an
infinite
number
of
times
up
until
the
deadline
without
losing
your
right
to
vote.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that
is
correct,
43
(d)
is
the
part
which
refers
to
a
voter
changing
his
affiliation
and
another
case
which
is
similar
and
where
the
implication
is
of
our
position
is
the
lipitt
case
in
ohio
where
this
court
decided
that
a
person
was
not
entitled
to
change
affiliation
in
order
to
be
a
candidate
for
office.
there
is
this
very
similar
case
in
illinois,
the
bendinger
versus
ogilvie
case
which
is
cited
extensively
in
our
brief,
which
was
cited
by
a
different
three-judge
panel
of
our
circuit
which
decided
that
the
man
who
would
vote
in
a
republican
primary
in
1971
could
not
run
for
office
as
a
democrat
in
the
primary
of
1972.
again,
they
didn’t
discuss
the
question
of
municipal,
they
just
assumed
that
any
primary
would
have
the
same
effect.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that
was
a
four-year
interval
and
as
i
recall
the
man
wished
to
change
from
republican
party
to
the
independent
party
to
run
for
congress.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it
was
a
candidate’s
case,
not
a
voter’s
case.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
in
the
bendinger
versus
ogilvie
case,
they
pointed
out
and
i’m
sure
i
cited
that
section
somewhere
in
my
brief,
it
must
be
in
the
appendix
in
my
brief
before
the
three-judge
panel,
that
if
you
can
preserve
party
integrity
because
that
is
the
balancing
factor
by
preventing
a
person
from
running
as
democrat
this
time
and
as
a
republican
the
next
time
and
then
as
a
conservative
and
then
as
a
liberal
and
jumping
up
and
there
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
right.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
think
the
question
of
party
integrity
versus
person’s
rights.
there
are
other
cases
which
have
been
decided
that
almost
say
in
effect
that
it
is
not
a
right
to
hold
public
office
but
a
privilege
so
in
the
face
of
protecting
party
integrity,
this
right
or
privilege
to
be
a
candidate
must
fall.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
right
to
vote
is
superior
to
the
right
to
be
a
candidate.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
where
do
i
find
that?
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
in
this
particular
--
it
is
not
mentioned
any
where
in
the
lipitt
case.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
the
bendinger
versus
ogilvie
case
which
i
did
cite
which
was
a
seventh
circuit
case
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
rights.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
because
i
do
not
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well
i
think
you
hit
the
knob,
but
i
don’t
think
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
is
constitutionally
protected.
i
do
think
the
right
to
--
i’m
certain
the
right
to
vote
is
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
the
right
to
vote?
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
i
believe
there
are
several
cases
where
this
court
has
determined
that
it
will
protect
ones
right
to
vote,
it
will
protect
one
from
being
disenfranchised.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
article
2
provide
--
article
2
of
the
constitution
provides
for
the
right
for
the
people
to
vote
for
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
right
to
vote
for
members
in
united
states
senate
was
added
by
a
later
amendment.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
submit
that
if
the
suffrage
amendment
was
passed
somewhere
around
1920
that
means
that
that
case
would
predate
that
and
i
would
suggest
--
respectfully
suggest
that
that
should
not
and
is
not
the
current
state
of
the
law.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
yes,
sir.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it
will.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
of
course,
party
raiding
is
a
theory
that
we
have.
nobody
can
determine
exactly
when
it
is
having
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
agree
and
there
are
political
theorists
who
would
suggest
that
the
results
of
the
election
in
1972,
the
primary
was
affected
by
this
but
we
are
not
here
to
argue
political
theory,
we
are
here
to
argue
a
person’s
right.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
have
not
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
of
course
wisconsin
and
minnesota,
i’m
glad
you
pointed
that
out
have
no
requirement
that
i
could
find.
there
is
no
bar
to
voting
by
past
registration.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
perhaps,
but
section
201
of
the
minnesota
code
states
the
requirements
for
registration
and
it
doesn’t
require
party
affiliation
of
the
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
but
if
the
argument
of
party
raiding
and
party
integrity
is
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion
then
if
this
case
is
affirmed,
there
will
be
a
disastrous
effect
on
the
political
party
system
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
south
carolina,
rhode
island
and
new
jersey
which
have
similar
cases
that
have
been
decided.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
many,
many
years.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
again,
we
are
in
the
realm
of
political
theory
but
my
point
is
if
wisconsin
and
minnesota
and
michigan
have
been
able
to
exist
by
having
the
open
primary
system
and
seem
to
be
thriving
and
doing
quite
well,
then
the
argument
that
this
case
is
the
only
thing
that
protects
the
two
party
system
from
dissolving
simply
cannot
hold
water
because
these
states
are
surviving
without
it.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
but
there
is
more
at
stake
than
strengthening
the
two-party
system.
they
have
the
right
to
do
that
if
they
so
choose
but
not
to
the
point
where
it
disenfranchises
voters.
that
the
right
to
protect
the
party
system
only
go
so
far
and
one
of
the
cases
which
i
cited
in
my
brief,
the
chucklin
decision
which
was
interestingly
decided
by
judge
marovitz
went
to
the
question
of
what
the
party’s
rights
were
with
respect
to
patronage
and
recognized
that
a
party
can
only
go
so
far
and
then
it
encroaches
on
the
rights
of
the
individual
citizens
and
thus
it
is
--
that
is
not
allowed
to
do.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
lipitt
versus
chipalone.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
on
the
basis
that
the
right
to
vote
is
superior
to
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
and
party
integrity
may
outweigh
one
but
not
the
other.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
the
stratification.
well,
number
one,
i
don’t
think,
again
although
justice
rehnquist
suggested
that
he
disagrees
or
suggest
that
some
may
disagree.
again,
the
question
of
which
protects
party
integrity
and
i
refer
to
the
bendinger
versus
ogilvie
case.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that’s
correct.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well
i
just
try
to
answer
both
questions
at
once.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
do
believe
despite
the
decision
that
you
cite
at
the
women’s
suffrage
case
that
the
right
to
vote
is
implicit
if
not
explicit
in
the
constitution
because
we
are
to
elect
the
house
of
representatives
and
we
are
to
vote
for
them.
somebody
has
to
do
the
voting
then
we
are
to
elect
electors
for
the
president.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
right
but
we
know
that
there
are
a
long
line
of
cases
where
the
federal
courts
have
said
and
this
court
had
said
that
certain
requirements
of
the
state
has
set
forth
are
unreasonable
and
it
gone
too
far.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
and
i
think
that
the
lipiit
case,
being
a
case
involving
a
candidate,
i
think
that
is
where
the
distinction
lies
and
i
think
it
is
a
valid
one.
the
lipitt
case
was
cited
both
in
nagler
(ph)
versus
yeomans
which
is
the
new
jersey
case,
where
the
new
jersey
statute
is
in
effect
where
the
court,
three-judge
panel
held,
that
the
fact
that
you
had
to
report
two
successive
primaries
to
be
left
before
a
voter
can
change
its
affiliation
is
patently
over
broad
in
scope.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
do
not
think
the
question
ever
arose
which
is
the
superior
right
in
that
case.
what
williams
stands
for
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
state
cannot
arbitrarily
pick
place,
too
heavy
a
burden
on
a
candidate’s
attempt
to
get
on
to
belt.
by
signature
requirements,
lipiit
said
it
is
a
valid
thing
to
require
that
if
he
is
to
run
as
a
candidate
of
a
particular
party
that
he
be
a
member
of
that
particular
party.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
for
four
years.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
thank
you.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
yes,
sir.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
absolutely
not,
because
state
elections
are
held
at
the
same
time
that
federal
elections
are
held
in
the
quadrennial
years.
plus
of
course
the
congressional
elections
are
held
at
the
state.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
yes,
i
would.
i
had
been
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it’s
not
stated
specifically
there
and
i
suppose
that
a
state
could
have
a
system
of
applying
all
of
its
officials,
i
supposed
and
that
there
would
be
no
need
to
elect
the
general
assembly
or
a
governor
or
any
officials?
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
as
far
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
state
of
illinois
cannot
limit
your
right
to
vote
in
a
federal
election
or
a
state
election
in
a
different
way.
in
other
words,
they
could
not
say
that
you
would
be
allowed
to
change
primaries
to
vote
for
federal
officers
but
not
changed
parties
to
vote
for
state
officers.
thank
you.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
cover
the
history
and
the
chronology
of
the
elections
since
this
has
been
raised.
first
of
all,
the
new
election
code
has
not
passed
the
general
assembly
yet.
secondly,
we
have
municipal
elections
in
different
municipalities,
at
the
same
time
we
have
them
in
chicago
and
they
are
partisan
elections
where
there
is
the
democratic
party
and
the
republican
party
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
no,
but
many
are
of
the
same
date.
going
back
historically,
in
april
of
1968,
certain
of
the
102
counties
in
the
state
of
illinois
had
primaries
where
candidates
were
running
in
the
democratic
and
republican
primary.
in
june
of
1968,
there
was
a
statewide
primary
that
was
before
the
time
and
that
was
not
changed.
in
october
of
1969,
there
was
a
special
congressional
election
which
affected
124
of
the
voters
of
the
state
after
congressman
rumsfeld
was
appointed
to
the
federal
position
by
president
nixon.
in
march
of
1970,
there
was
statewide
primary
with
the
new
change,
changing
it
from
june
to
march.
in
february
of
1971,
city
of
chicago,
city
of
waukegan
which
i
believe
is
about
the
5th
or
6th
largest
municipality
in
the
state
and
several
other
municipalities
held
their
primary
where
democratic
and
republican
parties
filled
with
candidates.
march
of
1972
was
the
state
primary
which
was
in
question
here.
in
april
of
1972,
there
were
again
county
elections
in
certain
--
county
primaries
excuse
me,
in
certain
of
the
counties
in
the
state
including
dupage
county
which
is
the
second
largest
county
in
the
state.
in
april
of
1972
--
excuse
me,
in
june
of
1973,
there
was
a
special
congressional
election
in
the
city
of
chicago
which
included
the
town
of
berwyn
which
is
a
part
of
chicago
board
of
election
commissioners
to
fill
the
vacancy
created
by
the
death
of
congressman
collin.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
no,
sir.
in
june
of
1973
was
the
special
congressional
election
on
june
5th.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it
was
a
special
primary,
i
am
sorry,
sir.
june
5th
was
the
special
primary.
july
3rd
was
the
special
election.
and
again,
in
march
of
1974,
the
statewide
primary
was
scheduled
and
on
february
of
1975
will
be
the
municipal
primary
in
chicago
and
hundreds
of
other
municipalities
throughout
the
state.
so,
the
idea
that
this
does
not
have
statewide
effect
simply
isn’t
so.
as
i
read
the
faherty
case,
what
the
court
was
asked
then
was
--
by
the
plaintiff,
does
this
statute
apply
to
me?
will
this
bar
me
from
changing
party
affiliation
in
the
primary
and
the
court
said
yes.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
in
the
municipal
primary,
yes
sir.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
voted
in
the
statewide
primary
in
1954
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
exactly,
and
even
the
dissent
of
judge
marovitz
where
he
disagreed
with
the
finding
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
did
not
rest
it
on
the
fact
that
it
is
a
municipal
primary
but
simply
rested
it
on
the
fact
of
compelling
state
interest
which
was
raised
at
some
link
in
the
brief.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
it
was
applied
statewide.
the
board
of
election
commissioners
issued
a
document
which
went
out
to
every
election
judge
in
the
3500
precincts
advising
them
that
the
23-month
rule
was
not
in
effect.
they
had
a
banner
which
was
about
this
long
which
was
placed
over
the
section
of
the
poster
which
stated
eligibility
to
vote,
which
changed
that
since
the
decision
came
so
soon
before
the
election.
it
was
given
statewide
effect.
as
it’s
pointed
in
page
13
of
the
appellees
brief,
the
board
of
election
commissioners
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
maintaining
the
election
code
within
their
jurisdiction.
there
are
103
jurisdictions
for
elections
under
the
current
election
code,
two
within
cook
county,
the
board
of
election
commissioners
and
the
county
handles
the
rest
of
the
area
and
then
each
of
the
other
101
counties
handled
their
own
election.
so,
they
each
having
election
officer
who
handles
it
and
they
must
handle
it,
of
course,
in
the
same
way.
so,
there
is
a
statewide
effect
to
it
and
i’m
certain
that
no
one
would
say
that
someone
could
have
one
right
to
vote
in
chicago
and
another
right
somewhere
else
in
the
state
based
on
the
same
statute.
i
think
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
in
the
opposite
primary.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
absolutely.
of
course,
and
what
i
attempted
to
pointed
out
with
the
dates
and
i
hope
i
didn’t
confuse
rather
than
eliminate
was
that
there
were
almost
always
be
two
elections
within
a
23-month
period.
so,
very
frequently
rather
than
very
rarely,
well
you
have
to
forfeit
your
right
to
vote
in
one
election
to
vote
in
another.
and
think
counsel's
use
of
the
term,
“participate
in
a
primary”
is
really
a
misnomer
because
you
are
voting
in
a
primary.
i
would
probably
exhaust
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
recited
the
citations
of
the
cases
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
your
right
to
vote
in
the
primary
is
a
sacrosanct
as
your
right
to
vote
in
a
general
election.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it
would
not
be
my
reading
of
illinois
electoral
history
that
that
would
be
so.
the
city
of
chicago
has
elected
the
democratic
american
consistently
since
1931.
there
are
less
than
five
republican
candidates
that
ever
carried
the
city
in
any
election
at
any
time
on
a
state
or
national
basis
since
then.
likewise,
there
are
other
counties
that
have
not
--
that
are
traditionally
republican
both
at
the
local
level
and
at
the
national
level.
so,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
consistency
in
the
state
of
illinois.
now,
i
am
not
as
familiar
of
course
with
other
areas.
i
think
what
we
held
when
we
get
to
the
middle
of
this
issue
is
a
conflict
in
rights.
we
recognized
the
right
of
a
state
to
regulate
elections,
the
right
of
the
state
to
protect
with
limitations,
party
integrity.
but
we
also
recognized
the
right
to
vote
and
it’s
alleged
in
the
complaint
in
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint
which
is
found
at
page
4
of
the
appendix
that
plaintiff
has
been
denied
her
right
to
vote
by
the
application
of
this
statute.
we
say
that
this
right,
this
right
to
vote
must
be
held
superior
to
the
right
to
protect
party
integrity.
in
a
case,
which
to
the
untrained
eye,
it
might
seem
controlling
in
this
case.
i
think
the
court
anticipated
that
in
rosario.
the
rosario
decision
which
interestingly
was
decided
one
year
to
the
date
after
the
primary
which
was
affected
by
our
case
stated
that
the
new
york
registration
statute
was
valid.
it
was
valid
to
require
one,
to
register
some
8
to
11
months
prior
to
a
primary
in
which
primary
he
was
going
to
vote
but
the
majority
said
in
that
case
that
this
was
not
“locking
in”
and
that’s
the
language
that’s
used
in
that
93
supreme
court
page
1250,
thus
new
york
scheme
does
not
lack
a
voter
in
to
an
unwanted
preexisting
party
affiliation
from
one
primary
to
the
next.
all
that
the
voter
had
to
do
in
that
case
if
he
wished
to
vote
in
the
primary
of
his
choice
was
simply
register
8
to
11
months
beforehand.
there
are
many
other
states
which
has
registration
requirements.
california
requirement
which
was
by
statute
56
days
has
just
been
reduced
by
court
to
30
days
in
the
case
of
gonass
(ph)
versus
young
which
i
believed
certiorari
was
denied
on
although
i
don’t
have
the
citation
with
me.
in
california,
you
register
at
the
time
you
vote
as
either
a
democrat
or
a
republican
or
you
register
as
unaffiliated.
you
cannot
vote
in
a
primary
unless
you
are
registered
in
that
party
but
you
can
change
your
affiliation
or
you
can
register
affiliation
at
any
time
up
to
now
30
days
beforehand.
so,
there
you
have
the
chance
to
formidably
do
something
your
self
to
enable
you
to
vote.
in
the
pontikes
case,
under
illinois
law,
the
only
way
you
can
qualify
to
vote
--
the
democratic
primary
at
one
point
is
if
you
did
not
vote
in
the
republican
primary
23
months
beforehand.
so,
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
will
in
effect
disenfranchise
you
at
any
election
in
the
succeeding
23
months
or
you
might
wish
to
vote
for
or
against
candidates
in
the
other
primary
which
is
your
right.
there
was
one
case
on
a
very
similar
statute
which
was
decided
before
our
case
and
there
were
two
cases
subsequent.
in
the
prior
case,
gordon
versus
executive
committee
of
charleston
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
there
was
in
a
set
--
a
calendar
year
requirement.
you
had
to
sign
an
affidavit
that
you
have
not
voted
in
the
opposite
party
primary
within
that
year.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
this
was
in
south
carolina.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
three-judge
court
and
there
the
court
--
unfortunately,
i
am
reading
from
a
slipped
opinion
that
i
have
been
using
for
the
last
two
years
and
it’s
on
page
5.
i
can’t
give
you
the
citated
page.
the
court
said,
“no
sound
or
compelling
purpose
can
possibly
justify
locking
a
citizen
into
a
party
and
denying
to
him
for
a
full
year
freedom
to
change
parties.
such
an
arbitrary
restrained
upon
the
voter
is
both
unreasonable
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
yes,
i’m
not
asking
the
court
to
disapprove
or
overrule
rosario.
i
think
that
the
majority
of
opinion
almost
anticipated
these
cases
in
rosario
when
they
went
on
to
say
that
the
reason
the
person
was
denied
the
right
to
vote
was
not
the
statute
but
his
own
forbearance
for
doing
the
simply
act
of
registration.
he
was
not
losing
the
right
to
vote
because
of
the
way
he
voted
before.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
right.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
but
in
new
york
if
he
had
voted
in
a
primary
in
the
democrat
party
for
example,
in
1970
he
could
have
up
until
8
or
11
months
or
whatever
the
exact
figure
was
prior
to
the
next
election,
changes
registration
and
register
in
the
liberal
party
of
the
conservative
or
the
republican
and
i
think
this
was
pointed
out
by
the
majority
and
i
think
that’s
why
the
rosario
decision
differs
here
and
that’s
why
it
is
not
inconsistent
to
hold,
to
affirm
in
this
case
despite
rosario.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
here
again,
they’re
talking
about
“locking
in”
and
the
locking
in
implies
and
it’s
used
in
these
cases
and
is
used
over
and
over
again,
that
you
lock
yourself
in,
not
by
registration
but
by
voting
and
that’s
where
the
difference
is.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
the
time
period
is
different.
it
is
a
calendar
year
as
suppose
to
12
months
or
another
period.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
because
i
can
see
where
registration
serves
a
useful
purpose.
in
illinois,
i
assume
in
other
states,
administrative
bodies
are
pointed
often
by
political
affiliation.
you
may
have
no
more
than
two
members
from
each
political
party
or
more
than
three
members.
so,
it’s
important
to
know
what
political
party
somebody
belongs
to
so
you
know
if
he
is
eligible
to
hold
an
office
but
voting
should
not
be
the
determining
factor
in
establishing
a
person’s
affiliation
because
this
is
something
that
changes.
you
can
change
registration.
in
new
york,
you
could
have
conceivably
changed
your
registration
since
the
last
primary,
an
infinite
number
of
times
up
until
the
deadline
without
losing
your
right
to
vote.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that
is
correct,
43
(d)
is
the
part
which
refers
to
a
voter
changing
his
affiliation
and
another
case
which
is
similar
and
where
the
implication
is
of
our
position
is
the
lipitt
case
in
ohio
where
this
court
decided
that
a
person
was
not
entitled
to
change
affiliation
in
order
to
be
a
candidate
for
office.
there
is
this
very
similar
case
in
illinois,
the
bendinger
versus
ogilvie
case
which
is
cited
extensively
in
our
brief,
which
was
cited
by
a
different
three-judge
panel
of
our
circuit
which
decided
that
the
man
who
would
vote
in
a
republican
primary
in
1971
could
not
run
for
office
as
a
democrat
in
the
primary
of
1972.
again,
they
didn’t
discuss
the
question
of
municipal,
they
just
assumed
that
any
primary
would
have
the
same
effect.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that
was
a
four-year
interval
and
as
i
recall
the
man
wished
to
change
from
republican
party
to
the
independent
party
to
run
for
congress.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it
was
a
candidate’s
case,
not
a
voter’s
case.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
in
the
bendinger
versus
ogilvie
case,
they
pointed
out
and
i’m
sure
i
cited
that
section
somewhere
in
my
brief,
it
must
be
in
the
appendix
in
my
brief
before
the
three-judge
panel,
that
if
you
can
preserve
party
integrity
because
that
is
the
balancing
factor
by
preventing
a
person
from
running
as
democrat
this
time
and
as
a
republican
the
next
time
and
then
as
a
conservative
and
then
as
a
liberal
and
jumping
up
and
there
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
right.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
think
the
question
of
party
integrity
versus
person’s
rights.
there
are
other
cases
which
have
been
decided
that
almost
say
in
effect
that
it
is
not
a
right
to
hold
public
office
but
a
privilege
so
in
the
face
of
protecting
party
integrity,
this
right
or
privilege
to
be
a
candidate
must
fall.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
right
to
vote
is
superior
to
the
right
to
be
a
candidate.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
where
do
i
find
that?
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
in
this
particular
--
it
is
not
mentioned
any
where
in
the
lipitt
case.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
the
bendinger
versus
ogilvie
case
which
i
did
cite
which
was
a
seventh
circuit
case
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
rights.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
because
i
do
not
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well
i
think
you
hit
the
knob,
but
i
don’t
think
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
is
constitutionally
protected.
i
do
think
the
right
to
--
i’m
certain
the
right
to
vote
is
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
the
right
to
vote?
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
i
believe
there
are
several
cases
where
this
court
has
determined
that
it
will
protect
ones
right
to
vote,
it
will
protect
one
from
being
disenfranchised.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
article
2
provide
--
article
2
of
the
constitution
provides
for
the
right
for
the
people
to
vote
for
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
right
to
vote
for
members
in
united
states
senate
was
added
by
a
later
amendment.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
submit
that
if
the
suffrage
amendment
was
passed
somewhere
around
1920
that
means
that
that
case
would
predate
that
and
i
would
suggest
--
respectfully
suggest
that
that
should
not
and
is
not
the
current
state
of
the
law.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
yes,
sir.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it
will.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
of
course,
party
raiding
is
a
theory
that
we
have.
nobody
can
determine
exactly
when
it
is
having
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
agree
and
there
are
political
theorists
who
would
suggest
that
the
results
of
the
election
in
1972,
the
primary
was
affected
by
this
but
we
are
not
here
to
argue
political
theory,
we
are
here
to
argue
a
person’s
right.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
have
not
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well,
of
course
wisconsin
and
minnesota,
i’m
glad
you
pointed
that
out
have
no
requirement
that
i
could
find.
there
is
no
bar
to
voting
by
past
registration.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
perhaps,
but
section
201
of
the
minnesota
code
states
the
requirements
for
registration
and
it
doesn’t
require
party
affiliation
of
the
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
but
if
the
argument
of
party
raiding
and
party
integrity
is
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion
then
if
this
case
is
affirmed,
there
will
be
a
disastrous
effect
on
the
political
party
system
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
south
carolina,
rhode
island
and
new
jersey
which
have
similar
cases
that
have
been
decided.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
many,
many
years.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
again,
we
are
in
the
realm
of
political
theory
but
my
point
is
if
wisconsin
and
minnesota
and
michigan
have
been
able
to
exist
by
having
the
open
primary
system
and
seem
to
be
thriving
and
doing
quite
well,
then
the
argument
that
this
case
is
the
only
thing
that
protects
the
two
party
system
from
dissolving
simply
cannot
hold
water
because
these
states
are
surviving
without
it.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
but
there
is
more
at
stake
than
strengthening
the
two-party
system.
they
have
the
right
to
do
that
if
they
so
choose
but
not
to
the
point
where
it
disenfranchises
voters.
that
the
right
to
protect
the
party
system
only
go
so
far
and
one
of
the
cases
which
i
cited
in
my
brief,
the
chucklin
decision
which
was
interestingly
decided
by
judge
marovitz
went
to
the
question
of
what
the
party’s
rights
were
with
respect
to
patronage
and
recognized
that
a
party
can
only
go
so
far
and
then
it
encroaches
on
the
rights
of
the
individual
citizens
and
thus
it
is
--
that
is
not
allowed
to
do.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
lipitt
versus
chipalone.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
on
the
basis
that
the
right
to
vote
is
superior
to
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
and
party
integrity
may
outweigh
one
but
not
the
other.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
the
stratification.
well,
number
one,
i
don’t
think,
again
although
justice
rehnquist
suggested
that
he
disagrees
or
suggest
that
some
may
disagree.
again,
the
question
of
which
protects
party
integrity
and
i
refer
to
the
bendinger
versus
ogilvie
case.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that’s
correct.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
well
i
just
try
to
answer
both
questions
at
once.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
do
believe
despite
the
decision
that
you
cite
at
the
women’s
suffrage
case
that
the
right
to
vote
is
implicit
if
not
explicit
in
the
constitution
because
we
are
to
elect
the
house
of
representatives
and
we
are
to
vote
for
them.
somebody
has
to
do
the
voting
then
we
are
to
elect
electors
for
the
president.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
right
but
we
know
that
there
are
a
long
line
of
cases
where
the
federal
courts
have
said
and
this
court
had
said
that
certain
requirements
of
the
state
has
set
forth
are
unreasonable
and
it
gone
too
far.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
and
i
think
that
the
lipiit
case,
being
a
case
involving
a
candidate,
i
think
that
is
where
the
distinction
lies
and
i
think
it
is
a
valid
one.
the
lipitt
case
was
cited
both
in
nagler
(ph)
versus
yeomans
which
is
the
new
jersey
case,
where
the
new
jersey
statute
is
in
effect
where
the
court,
three-judge
panel
held,
that
the
fact
that
you
had
to
report
two
successive
primaries
to
be
left
before
a
voter
can
change
its
affiliation
is
patently
over
broad
in
scope.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
i
do
not
think
the
question
ever
arose
which
is
the
superior
right
in
that
case.
what
williams
stands
for
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
state
cannot
arbitrarily
pick
place,
too
heavy
a
burden
on
a
candidate’s
attempt
to
get
on
to
belt.
by
signature
requirements,
lipiit
said
it
is
a
valid
thing
to
require
that
if
he
is
to
run
as
a
candidate
of
a
particular
party
that
he
be
a
member
of
that
particular
party.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
for
four
years.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
thank
you.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
yes,
sir.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
absolutely
not,
because
state
elections
are
held
at
the
same
time
that
federal
elections
are
held
in
the
quadrennial
years.
plus
of
course
the
congressional
elections
are
held
at
the
state.
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
yes,
i
would.
i
had
been
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
it’s
not
stated
specifically
there
and
i
suppose
that
a
state
could
have
a
system
of
applying
all
of
its
officials,
i
supposed
and
that
there
would
be
no
need
to
elect
the
general
assembly
or
a
governor
or
any
officials?
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
as
far
--
mr.
ray
jeffrey
cohen
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
state
of
illinois
cannot
limit
your
right
to
vote
in
a
federal
election
or
a
state
election
in
a
different
way.
in
other
words,
they
could
not
say
that
you
would
be
allowed
to
change
primaries
to
vote
for
federal
officers
but
not
changed
parties
to
vote
for
state
officers.
thank
you.
