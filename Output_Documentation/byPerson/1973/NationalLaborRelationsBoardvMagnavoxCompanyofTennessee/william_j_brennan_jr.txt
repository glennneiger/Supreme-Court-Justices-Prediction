justice

and
as
in
this
case
again
we
have
a
change
of
part
of
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

now,
that
that
--
is
this
given
another
rulemaking
version
of
the
june

question
or
is
that
not
presented?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
apparently
what
this
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
it
says
on
behalf
of
and
i
noticed
that
the
union
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
here;
no
i
guess
the
respondents
aren’t
favoring
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

of
course,
the
dissenter
at
trail.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you’re
saying
really
is
that
once
the
majority
chooses
then
the
chosen
representative
may
waive
the
rights
for
all
dissenters
and
those
supporters
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
happens
to
republic
aviation
and
to
gale
if
we
agree
with
you
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
gather
of
your
basic
premise
of
bargaining
agent
can
waive
for
everybody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that’s
really
what
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
though,
if
--
i
think
you
said
earlier,
basically,
there’s
a
conflict
here
between
two
policies
in
the
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
and
ordinarily,
i
gather
or
i
think
that’s
what
we
held
in
the
many
cases,
did
we
not,
conflicts
of
this
kind
are
for
the
board
to
resolve,
didn’t
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
we
held,
the
general
preposition
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
mean
--
but
that’s
a
general
premise,
isn’t’
it?
where
the
conflicts
between
different
policies
and
the
act,
we
expect
the
board
in
the
first
instance
to
resolve
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
--
then
what’s
the
scope
of
our
review
of
the
resolution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
amount
to
saying
that
we
look
for
to
see
whether
that
was
an
error
of
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
a
broader
review?
