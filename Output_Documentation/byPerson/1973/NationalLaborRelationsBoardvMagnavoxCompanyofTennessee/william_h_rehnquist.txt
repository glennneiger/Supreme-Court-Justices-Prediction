how
about
the
bulletin
board
though,
isn’t
there
some
argument
that
that
was
in
part
of
concession
by
the
company
that
they
would
make
this
bulletin
board
available?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn’t
the
board
put
some
limit
on
its
holding,
in
this
case
that
--
didn’t
it
imply
at
least
that
the
no
distribution
rule
might
be
valid
for
circulation
of
things
that
were
not
perhaps
section
7
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
precise
material
was
it
that
initiated
this
thing
that
the
record
seem
to
me
a
little
bit
vague
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
that
assumption
from
it,
there
weren’t
any
facts
to
support
it?
where
did
the
parties
get
that
assumption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
literature
on
behalf
of
the
union
might
be
subject
to
the
mason
&
hanger
doctrine,
couldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
charge
brought
by
the
union
or
by
an
individual
employee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
had
signed
the
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
first,
what
you’re
talking
about
here
mr.
nash
would
be
pretty
well
met
by
the
board’s
gale
products
remedy,
wouldn’t
it
rather
than
the
expanded
version
that’s
been
now
preferred?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
they
telling
about
literature
distribution
in
republic
aviation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
least,
you
can’t
bar
them
under
your
waiver
theory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
would
think
not.
if
the
theory
of
your
waiver
is
that
the
incumbent
union
and
the
employees
have
consented
by
virtue
of
a
contract
that’s
well
and
good
for
them,
but
for
--
for
a
non-employee,
soliciting
for
another
union,
maybe,
you
can
bar
them
under
babcock
&
wilcox,
but
you
can’t
bar
them
under
your
waiver
theory?
