justice
byron
r.
white
at
any
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
the
union
that’s
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
apply
that
it
couldn't
waive
it
for
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
you
could
where
the
union
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
said
not
for
the
union
involved
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
literature
against
the
change?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
not
an
argument
against
incumbency.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
the
contract
provision
that
there
is
a
rule
against
distribution
of
company
property
on
--
at
nonworking
time
where
challenged
on
its
bottom,
it
wouldn’t
stand,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
must
rest
on
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose,
the
contract
provision
is
in
itself
in
part
invalid.
i
mean,
it
is
unforeseeable
in
the
sense
that
it
purports
to
permit
the
company
to
waive
the
rights
if
they
have
any
of
some
other
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn’t
your
rule
purport
to
bar
the
distribution
of
literature
by
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
how
about
a
non-incumbent
union
distributing
union
literature
--
anti-union
literature
or
anti-incumbent
literature
on
company
property
at
nonworking
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
the
contract,
but
what
if
the
union
--
let’s
say
the
union,
the
non-incumbent
union
has
a
spy
or
has
some
friends
among
the
working
force
and
they
are
distributing
its
literature
on
company
property
in
nonworking
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
thought
it
--
isn’t
that
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
couldn’t
enforce
it.
again,
you
couldn’t
enforce
that
as
the
non-incumbent
union
could
have
you
on
the
carpet
for
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
really
the
--
well,
the
waiver
is
inoperative
with
respect
to
other
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
the
waiver
--
it
still
binds
the
incumbent
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
is
it
just
doesn’t
give
you
any
right
to
exclude
the
non-incumbent
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn’t
illegally
effective
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
the
union
say
--
what
would
the
union
say
if
they
--
if
they
thought
they
were
--
if
they
were
willing
to
agree
to
a
company
rule
that
excluded
everybody?
all
unions
from
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
they
suddenly
found
out
that
the
company’s
rule
against
non-incumbent
union
wasn’t
enforceable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
--
now,
let’s
assume
gale
products
is
still
good
law
or
it
is
good
law,
just
assume
that
it
is
good
law
then
the
company’s
rule
against
the
non-incumbent
is
not
enforceable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
union
didn’t
get
what
it
thought
it
was
bargaining
for
perhaps?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
in
the
gale,
was
it
’54,
1954?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
you
say
for
16
years
they’ve
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
there
was
a
--
when
before
gale
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
one
other
thing?
we’ve
talked
about
whether
some
right
is
waivable
or
not
but
it
might
be
that
the
right
would
be
waivable,
statutorily
it
would
be
waivable,
but
it
has
to
--
it
can’t
be
waived
by
the
bargaining
agent.
what
is
the
function
and
purpose
of
the
bargaining
agent,
an
incumbent
anyway?
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
the
right
would
be
waivable
by
union
members
or
by
the
personal
rights,
but
that
the
authority
to
bargaining
agent
just
wouldn’t
reach
the
waiving
the
rights
of
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you?
does
an
incumbent
union
have
some
rights
independent
of
the
people
in
the
bargaining
unit
with
respect
with
distribution
of
literature?
it
may
be
one
thing
to
say
that
the
incumbent
union
can
waive
the
rights
of
the
people
of
the
union,
but
if
the
union
--
if
an
outside
union
has
rights
to
the
throne?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
that's
(voice
overlap)
the
rights
of
an
outside
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
outside
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
shouldn’t
be
any
power
in
the
incumbent
union
to
waive
those
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
rule,
your
rule
supports
to
bar
that
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don’t
bar
outside
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
any
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
this
one?
