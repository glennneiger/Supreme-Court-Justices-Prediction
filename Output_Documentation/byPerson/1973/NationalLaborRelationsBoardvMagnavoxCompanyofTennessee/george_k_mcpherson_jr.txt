mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hate
to
take
issue
with
mr.
nash,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
faced
directly
here
with
freedom
of
contract
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
opposed
to
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature,
and
i
think
this
is
the
primary
issue
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
before
getting
into
that
discussion,
i
believe
that
there
are
several
factual
situations
which
should
be
brought
out
that
have
been
ignored
by
general
counsel.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
organizational
activity
going
on
at
any
time
during
the
period
of
the
enforcement
of
this
rule
leading
to
the
filing
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
the
literature
to
be
distributed
was
to
be
distributed
by
and
on
behalf
of
the
incumbent
union
about
an
internal
union
matter.
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
waiver
rejected
for
passing
out
on
company
property.
secondly,
the
general
counsel
has
totally
ignored
the
fact
that
employees
are
totally
able
to
solicit
and
discuss
any
matters
they
so
desire
on
company
premises
anywhere
at
anytime
that
does
not
involve
their
work
time.
therefore,
we
do
not
have
the
republic
aviation
situation
of
a
no
distribution
and
no
solicitation
situation.
additionally,
the
evidence
on
the
record
demonstrated
thoroughly
that
ultimate
avenues
of
communication
were
available,
utilized
and
effective.
the
evidence
demonstrated
that
through
the
16-year
history
between
the
union
and
the
employer,
that
employees
who
wanted
to
pass
out
material
were
able
to
do
so
effectively
by
standing
at
the
plant
entrances
off
of
company
property
to
make
their
distribution.
thus,
i
think
we
have
three
highly
relevant
factors
here.
one,
no
organizational
activity
going
on;
two,
an
ability
of
the
employees
to
discuss
and
solicit
on
company
property;
and
three,
an
effective
use
of
an
alternate
means
of
distribution
on
company
property,
i.e.
being
able
to
distribute
right
at
the
plant
entrance
which
they
had
done
for
over
16
years.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
a
standard
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
think
that
you
can
find
this
in
the
appendix
at
pages
56,
65,
77,
and
78,
99,
and
103
as
to
the
use
of
distribution
of
literature
at
the
gate.
as
to
the
full
discussion
during
nonwork
time
in
all
areas
of
the
plant,
i
think
that
is
recited
in
the
appendix
at
page
127
and
136.
quite
contrary
to
a
red
herring
situation
of
alternative
means
of
communication
being
available,
i
think
that
is
extremely
germane
to
a
consideration
of
this
case.
it
has
been
considered
germane
by
the
seventh
circuit
when
they
overruled
the
board
in
gale
products.
it
was
considered
germane
by
the
sixth
circuit
when
they
overruled
the
board
in
armco
steel,
when
they
overruled
the
board
in
general
motors,
and
when
they
overruled
the
board
in
this
case.
it
has
also
been
considered,
i
think,
germane
by
the
board
itself
in
its
later
determinations
in
stoddard-quirk
as
well
as
in
its
discussion
on
gale
products
itself.
now,
what
we
have
is
going
back
to
the
history
of
the
board’s
development
of
this
line,
is
in
1944
the
may
company
case
basically
held
that
this
right
was
not
so
fundamental
that
it
could
not
be
waived.
and
that
basically
was
the
status
of
the
law
until
the
1963
gale
products
case.
in
that
case,
which
again
involved
a
total
ban
against
solicitation
and
a
total
ban
against
distribution
on
company
property,
the
board
followed
basically
the
republic
aviation
theory
that
because
of
the
ban
on
distribution
of
literature
and
because
of
the
ban
on
solicitation
with
solicitation
being
shown
as
being
the
place
uniquely
appropriate
for
employees
to
discuss
their
policy,
that
there
was
an
impediment
to
the
section
7
rights
of
employees
here
which
had
not
been
overcome.
now,
there
was
a
very
strong
dissent
in
the
gale
products
case
by
the
chairman
at
that
time
mr.
mccullough
and
by
member
leedham
(ph).
they
pointed
out
that
certainly,
alternate
means
of
communication
were
available
here,
employees
were
able
to
discuss
matters
on
company
property
during
their
free
time,
and
stated
as
such
there
should
be
a
waiver
capable
by
the
incumbent
union.
the
majority
of
the
board
in
a
footnote
took
cognizance
of
the
minority’s
opinion
particularly
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
freely
discuss
on
company
property,
matters
such
as
changing
or
retaining
the
collective
bargaining
agent,
and
stated
that
the
evidence
to
their
satisfaction
showed
that
that
was
not
the
case
that
these
matters
could
not
be
discussed.
secondly,
as
to
alternative
means
available,
the
majority
in
gale
products
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
this
effect,
and
therefore,
went
with
there
presumption.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
as
i
noted
earlier,
overruled
gale
products
saying
that
no
presumption
should
stand
here
that
we
are
talking
really
about
freedom
of
contract,
and
if
there
are
effective
alternative
means
available,
then
the
section
7
rights
of
the
employees
has
not
been
impaired,
and
freedom
of
contract
should
be
given
full
reign
and
the
validity
of
the
contract
procedure
should
stand
absent
a
showing
of
an
actual
interference
in
section
7
rights,
which
had
not
been
done
in
gale
products,
in
armco
nor
has
it
been
done
here.
in
fact,
the
board
chose
in
this
case
to
totally
ignore
the
alternate
means
of
communication
available,
used
and
found
effective
by
the
union
throughout
its
16-year
history,
and
chose
to
rely
instead
simply
upon
the
presumption
found
in
stoddard-quirk
and
republic
aviation
and
peyton
packing.
we
would
submit
that
this
is
totally
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
contrary
to
the
duty
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
enforce
that
act
and
foster
collective
bargaining.
i
think
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
founded
upon
the
proposition
that
the
union
will
provide
fair
representation
to
the
employees
it
represents.
otherwise,
we
could
never
really
go
through
the
bargaining
process
or
the
negotiating
process
of
assuming
that
the
union
was
not
going
to
fulfill
its
obligation.
thus,
founded
upon
the
principle
of
fair
representation,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
union
fulfills
its
obligation
to
the
employees
by
bargaining
on
their
behalf
and
entrenches
themselves
as
the
bargaining
representative
by
its
performance
of
its
duties
under
the
act
and
to
the
employees
it
represents
in
this
particular
case.
additionally,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
not
only
the
fair
representation
aspects
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
general
counsel
attempted
to
categorize
or
characterize
the
right
to
strike
as
being
different
from
other
section
7
rights
guaranteed
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
frankly
don’t
think
that
section
7
either
graduates
or
categorizes
any
of
the
rights
under
section
7
into
separate
categories
or
characterizations.
i
do
know,
however,
that
the
right
to
strike
is
dealt
with
specifically
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
whereas
the
right
to
distribute
literature
is
not.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
act
that
per
se
gives
and
fully
leaves
the
right
to
distribute
literature
on
company
property.
it
is
a
right
that
has
arisen
inferentially
as
a
means
of
communication
to
effectuate
section
7
rights.
as
a
means
of
communication,
it
is
therefore,
not
so
unique
or
not
so
fundamental
that
it
cannot
under
certain
circumstances
be
waived.
and
as
i
mentioned
yesterday
on
the
point
of
fair
representation,
the
court’s
holding
in
the
mastro
case
was
based
upon
the
premise
of
fair
representation.
that
fair
representation
theory,
i
think,
should
extend
to
the
collective
bargaining
process.
and
in
this
case,
particularly
when
you
are
looking
at
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
act,
being
to
foster
collective
bargaining
or
the
principle
of
freedom
of
contract.
where
you
have
freedom
of
contract
and
collective
bargaining
being
engaged
in,
that
process
should
go
without
being
interfered
in,
except
where
absolutely
necessary.
i
think
the
court
stated
the
concern
that
it
would
have
with
undue
interference
into
the
collective
bargaining
process
when
they
talked
about
conflicting
rights
in
babcock
&
wilcox.
there,
the
court
was
faced
with
distribution
rights
of
non-employees
as
opposed
to
property
rights
of
employers.
in
that
particular
case,
this
court
held
that
where
there
was
no
necessary
conflict,
there
should
not
be
an
abridgment
of
either
right.
i
think
that
is
particularly
true
in
the
type
of
case
we
have
here
where
we
have
freedom
of
contract
on
one
hand
versus
a
means
of
communication
on
the
other
which
would
lead
me
into
this
court’s
decision
in
nutone,
the
steelworkers’
case.
there,
the
court
was
faced
with
whether
or
not
employers
could
utilize
a
means
of
communication
which
they
prohibited
employees
from
using.
and
in
that
case,
stated
that
unions
and
employees
are
not
guaranteed
every
means
of
communication
simply
because
the
employer
may
utilize
it.
but
that
whether
or
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
committed,
whether
or
not
no
distribution
or
no
solicitation
rules
should
be
invalidated
is
dependent
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
the
court
noted
in
nutone
that
there
was
no
showing
just
as
in
this
instant
case
of
any
undue
influence
or
interference
with
the
employees’
ability
to
communicate
with
one
another.
it
also
stated
to
the
board
that
alternate
means
of
communication
was
highly
relevant
to
a
consideration
as
to
whether
distribution
or
solicitation
rule
should
be
invalidated,
and
stated
that
since
that
issue
was
not
presented
to
the
board
and
no
evidence
taken
on
it,
the
employer’s
conduct
could
not
be
found
wanting.
that
basically
is
what
i
think
the
respondent’s
position
is
in
this
case.
we
do
not
argue
as
the
supreme
court
pointed
out
in
the
nutone
case
that
under
every
factual
situation
or
under
every
circumstance
it
may
arise
there
may
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
committed.
what
we
do
say
is
that
the
board
should
not
presume
away
the
freedom
of
contract
of
the
parties,
but
should
rather
look
to
see
if
there
has
in
fact
been
an
interference
with
the
communication
rights
that
employees
may
have
under
section
7,
and
that
was
not
done
here.
no
analysis
was
made
whatsoever
of
the
alternatives
available
to
employees.
had
there
been,
they
would
have
seen
that
the
evidence
on
the
record
clearly
established
the
fact
that
for
16
years,
the
union
and
employees
had
effectively
distributed
literature
at
company
gates,
that
the
employees
had
the
right
of
free
discussion
and
free
solicitation
on
company
property
which
brings
with
it
the
right
to
sign
union
cards
or
to
sign
petitions,
to
decertify
or
to
start
to
the
decertification
proceeding.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
if
it
had
not
been
bilaterally
agreed
to,
we
would
fall
within
the
republic
aviation
theory.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
don’t
think
i
would
agree
with
that
statement.
i
think
the
--
i
think
again
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
by
anyone.
it
would
apply
equally
to
the
incumbent
as
to
another
labor
union
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
under
the
rule.
under
the
contract
waiver.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
there
would
be
no
distribution
of
literature
allowed
on
company
property.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
under
republic
aviation,
that
rule
would
not
be
valid
unless
special
circumstances
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
think
either
could
have
us
on
the
carpet
on
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
there
were
not
the
waiver
that’s
really
involved.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
waiver
is
inoperative
as
respect
to
other
unions.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
we
think
that
the
waiver
should
be
binded
against
all
employees.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
no,
it
does.
the
waiver
is
only
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
that,
i
think
is
one
of
the
issues
that
this
court
has
to
face
that
the
waiver,
i
mean,
the
rule
--
the
rule
was
in
effect
against
all
employees
for
distribution
of
literature
of
any
kind
on
company
property.
that
was
what
had
been
waived
by
the
union.
that
would
apply
to
any
employee
who
is
going
to
distribute
regardless
of
what
the
cause.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that’s
what
this
rule
is.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
again
i
think
that
may
be
what
we
come
up
with
here
if
you
go
the
route
of
gale
products.
now,
gale
products
split
employees
into
two
groups.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
of
course,
gale
products
was
the
status
of
the
law
at
the
time
the
bargain
was
struck
and
was
the
status
of
the
law
until
the
time
of
this
decision
and
i
would
assume
that
the
parties
would
be
presumed
to
know
their
rights
and
the
law
at
the
time
they’re
sitting
at
the
bargaining
table.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
gale
was
in
1963.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
the
first
contract
was
struck
in
1955.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
before
gale
and
at
that
time
we
would
have
been
under
may
department
store.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
would
be.
that
is
our
interpretation
of
the
rule.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
disagree
with
that
analogy
of
the
situation
mr.
justice
blackmun
for
the
reason
that
we
do
have
full
and
complete
solicitation
rights
and
discussion
rights
on
company
property.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
disagree
with
that
also
from
the
standpoint
of
the
fact
that
for
16
years,
the
history
has
shown
that
the
employees
have
been
able
to
effectively
distribute
literature
at
plant
entrances
and
exits.
and
this,
it
would
seem
to
me
would
--
it
is
what
the
board
has
recognized
in
stoddard-quirk.
in
stoddard-quirk,
they
talk
about
the
discussion
between
or
the
distinction
between
oral
solicitation
or
discussion
and
a
written
communication
and
state
in
stoddard-quirk
that
a
written
communication
is
meant
to
be
of
a
permanent
nature
to
be
read
and
re-read
at
the
leisure
of
the
recipient
and
its
purpose
is
satisfied
so
long
as
it
is
received.
that
even
go
on
to
recognize
and
state
in
their
decision
in
stoddard-quirk
that
plant
entrances
and
exits
are
in
fact
an
effective
means
of
distributing
this
literature.
so,
i
do
not
feel
that
the
dissidents’
right
to
voice
their
opposition
to
the
incumbent
union
is
in
any
way
impaired
in
this
situation.
what
we
have
here
really
is
full
discussion
by
anyone
on
any
subject
that
they
want
within
the
plant
facility,
including
the
ability
to
pass
out
union
authorization
cards
and
get
them
signed
or
a
petition
to
decertify,
as
well
as
the
ability
to
effectively
pass
out
literature
of
whatever
nature
they
may
want
at
the
plant
gate.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
machinists
case
is
totally
contrary
to
the
position
that
we
have
here.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
the
facts
are
considerably
different
in
that
case
and
the
court
there
as
you
will
well
recall
discussed
or
took
the
position
that
there
could
not
be
a
total
waiver
of
rights
in
this
type
of
a
situation.
additionally,
the
court
refused
and
so
noted
in
its
opinion
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
distribution
of
literature
could
be
waived
at
a
time
when
the
bargaining
agent
could
not
be
changed,
which
i
think
throws
it
into
a
somewhat
different
category
than
what
we
are
really
faced
here.
but
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
is
generally
tending
to
go
in
the
direction
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
i
think
really
has
a
fear
that
the
union
will
not
protect
employee
rights
when
there
can
be
a
distinction
between
the
union’s
rights
and
the
employee’s
rights.
that
gets
me
back
to
my
fair
representation
premise
that
i
think
we
must
work
off
of
in
a
collective
bargaining
context.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
that
the
bargaining
agent
being
chosen
as
the
duly
certified
representative
of
the
employees
to
a
duly
conducted
election
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
the
employee
has
chosen
him
as
his
bargaining
representative.
in
other
words,
he
has
the
alter
ego
for
the
employee.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
in
any
case,
the
majority
must
rule.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
would
be
our
position.
so
long
as
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
i
think
gale
products
would
definitely
be
overruled,
but
of
course,
the
board
itself
is
deviating
from
gale
products.
but
republic
aviation
to
me
would
not
be
touched.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
because
of
the
bilateral
nature
and
freedom
of
contract
concept
as
opposed
to
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
it’s
his
primary
duty
to
protect
the
rights
of
his
employees.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
major
considerations
that
has
to
be
given
in
this.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
even
though
some
of
those
may
not
want
to
stay
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct
in
my
opinion
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
waiver
as
was
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
mastro
should
be
given
effect
so
long
as
the
selection
remains
free.
and
what
we
are
really
asking
for
is
for
a
determination
for
the
board
to
make
a
determination
and
not
a
presumption
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
interference
with
that
selection.
now,
if
freedom
to
select
a
bargaining
representative
were
dependent
entirely
upon
the
rights
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
then
surely
we
would
not
have
the
nutone
case,
surely,
we
would
not
have
the
republic
aviation
or
babcock
&
wilcox.
so,
what
we’re
asking
for
is
really
what
i
think
the
court
was
looking
for
in
nutone
when
they
said,
“look
at
the
case
and
make
a
determination.”
my
whole
point
basically
is
that
freedom
of
contract
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
being
one
of
its
primary
purposes,
is
simply
too
fundamental
to
that
act
to
be
presumed
away
as
was
done
here.
and
as
i
stated,
i
don’t
say
that
in
every
circumstance
we
will
not
have
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
--
would
say
conflicts
of
this
kind
is
for
the
board
to
resolve
so
long
as
they
fulfill
their
duty
in
looking
at
the
facts
necessary
to
resolve
that
question.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
we
expect
the
board
to
resolve
them,
but
we
expect
them
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
think
the
scope
of
the
review
would
be
basically
the
same
scope
of
review
that
this
court
exercised
in
babcock
&
wilcox,
and
nutone
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
board
fulfilled
its
role
in
that
regard
by
looking
at
the
relevant
factors
to
make
that
determination.
now,
one
other
point
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
would
--
i
would
not
quite
categorize
it
in
that
--
in
that
term.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
yes,
sir,
now,
i
would
say
this.
one
other
point,
i
think
is
of
concern
in
this
case
is
the
board
in
overruling
its
decision
in
gale
products
has
gone
farther
in
formulating
its
remedy
than
it
has
ever
gone
before
in
this
area
and
much
farther
than
it
went
in
the
fifth
circuit
or
the
eighth
circuit.
in
those
circuits
which
the
board
relies
on
as
supporting
their
proposition,
the
remedy
there
was
limited
to
distribution
or
solicitation
on
behalf
of
any
other
labor
organization
other
than
the
incumbent
or
distribution
or
solicitation
against
any
labor
organization.
now,
here,
they
have
also
gone
that
step,
but
they
have
added
the
additional
step
of
throwing
in
all
other
section
7
rights,
regardless
of
whether
you
have
the
potential
split
between
employee
interest
and
the
incumbent
union’s
interest
as
seems
to
be
feared
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
mid-states.
in
other
words,
under
the
board’s
remedy
as
they
have
fashioned
it
in
this
case,
it
would
apply
to
a
handout
announcing
a
union
meeting.
it
would
apply
to
a
reminder
to
pay
union
dues.
it
would
apply
to
an
announcement
of
the
filing
of
a
grievance.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
that
if
--
if
the
union
can
waive
some
rights
of
employees,
certainly,
they
should
be
able
to
waive
their
own
rights.
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
are
you
talking
about
the
incumbent
or
the
outside?
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
the
outside
union
have
the
rights
i
would
say
as
defined
in
the
area
of
solicitation
and
distribution
as
defined
by
this
court
in
babcock
&
wilcox.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
oh!
no,
sir.
and
there
has
been
no
diminishment
in
the
outside
unions
right
because
under
bab
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
it
bars
them
from
--
on
property
distri
--
employees
from
on
property
distribution.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
oh!
outsiders
would
fall
under
the
babcock
&
wilcox
rule
which
says
that
they
may,
under
any
circumstances
be
barred
to
off
of
company
property
for
distribution
and
solicitation.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
yes,
we
could
bar
them
under
our
waiver
theory.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
there
would
be
no
--
i
don’t
think
you’d
really
face
that
question
out
of
the
waiver
because
of
the
babcock
&
wilcox.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice
which
is
the
reason
for
babcock
&
wilcox.
but
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
presumption
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
mid-states
is
a
very
real
fear
that
the
union
will
not
fairly
represent
employees
in
this
type
of
context,
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
take
a
very
serious
look
at
the
remedy
that
it
has
purported
to
follow
which
is
far
in
access
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit's
holding.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hate
to
take
issue
with
mr.
nash,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
faced
directly
here
with
freedom
of
contract
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
opposed
to
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature,
and
i
think
this
is
the
primary
issue
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
before
getting
into
that
discussion,
i
believe
that
there
are
several
factual
situations
which
should
be
brought
out
that
have
been
ignored
by
general
counsel.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
organizational
activity
going
on
at
any
time
during
the
period
of
the
enforcement
of
this
rule
leading
to
the
filing
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
the
literature
to
be
distributed
was
to
be
distributed
by
and
on
behalf
of
the
incumbent
union
about
an
internal
union
matter.
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
waiver
rejected
for
passing
out
on
company
property.
secondly,
the
general
counsel
has
totally
ignored
the
fact
that
employees
are
totally
able
to
solicit
and
discuss
any
matters
they
so
desire
on
company
premises
anywhere
at
anytime
that
does
not
involve
their
work
time.
therefore,
we
do
not
have
the
republic
aviation
situation
of
a
no
distribution
and
no
solicitation
situation.
additionally,
the
evidence
on
the
record
demonstrated
thoroughly
that
ultimate
avenues
of
communication
were
available,
utilized
and
effective.
the
evidence
demonstrated
that
through
the
16-year
history
between
the
union
and
the
employer,
that
employees
who
wanted
to
pass
out
material
were
able
to
do
so
effectively
by
standing
at
the
plant
entrances
off
of
company
property
to
make
their
distribution.
thus,
i
think
we
have
three
highly
relevant
factors
here.
one,
no
organizational
activity
going
on;
two,
an
ability
of
the
employees
to
discuss
and
solicit
on
company
property;
and
three,
an
effective
use
of
an
alternate
means
of
distribution
on
company
property,
i.e.
being
able
to
distribute
right
at
the
plant
entrance
which
they
had
done
for
over
16
years.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
a
standard
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
think
that
you
can
find
this
in
the
appendix
at
pages
56,
65,
77,
and
78,
99,
and
103
as
to
the
use
of
distribution
of
literature
at
the
gate.
as
to
the
full
discussion
during
nonwork
time
in
all
areas
of
the
plant,
i
think
that
is
recited
in
the
appendix
at
page
127
and
136.
quite
contrary
to
a
red
herring
situation
of
alternative
means
of
communication
being
available,
i
think
that
is
extremely
germane
to
a
consideration
of
this
case.
it
has
been
considered
germane
by
the
seventh
circuit
when
they
overruled
the
board
in
gale
products.
it
was
considered
germane
by
the
sixth
circuit
when
they
overruled
the
board
in
armco
steel,
when
they
overruled
the
board
in
general
motors,
and
when
they
overruled
the
board
in
this
case.
it
has
also
been
considered,
i
think,
germane
by
the
board
itself
in
its
later
determinations
in
stoddard-quirk
as
well
as
in
its
discussion
on
gale
products
itself.
now,
what
we
have
is
going
back
to
the
history
of
the
board’s
development
of
this
line,
is
in
1944
the
may
company
case
basically
held
that
this
right
was
not
so
fundamental
that
it
could
not
be
waived.
and
that
basically
was
the
status
of
the
law
until
the
1963
gale
products
case.
in
that
case,
which
again
involved
a
total
ban
against
solicitation
and
a
total
ban
against
distribution
on
company
property,
the
board
followed
basically
the
republic
aviation
theory
that
because
of
the
ban
on
distribution
of
literature
and
because
of
the
ban
on
solicitation
with
solicitation
being
shown
as
being
the
place
uniquely
appropriate
for
employees
to
discuss
their
policy,
that
there
was
an
impediment
to
the
section
7
rights
of
employees
here
which
had
not
been
overcome.
now,
there
was
a
very
strong
dissent
in
the
gale
products
case
by
the
chairman
at
that
time
mr.
mccullough
and
by
member
leedham
(ph).
they
pointed
out
that
certainly,
alternate
means
of
communication
were
available
here,
employees
were
able
to
discuss
matters
on
company
property
during
their
free
time,
and
stated
as
such
there
should
be
a
waiver
capable
by
the
incumbent
union.
the
majority
of
the
board
in
a
footnote
took
cognizance
of
the
minority’s
opinion
particularly
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
freely
discuss
on
company
property,
matters
such
as
changing
or
retaining
the
collective
bargaining
agent,
and
stated
that
the
evidence
to
their
satisfaction
showed
that
that
was
not
the
case
that
these
matters
could
not
be
discussed.
secondly,
as
to
alternative
means
available,
the
majority
in
gale
products
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
this
effect,
and
therefore,
went
with
there
presumption.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
as
i
noted
earlier,
overruled
gale
products
saying
that
no
presumption
should
stand
here
that
we
are
talking
really
about
freedom
of
contract,
and
if
there
are
effective
alternative
means
available,
then
the
section
7
rights
of
the
employees
has
not
been
impaired,
and
freedom
of
contract
should
be
given
full
reign
and
the
validity
of
the
contract
procedure
should
stand
absent
a
showing
of
an
actual
interference
in
section
7
rights,
which
had
not
been
done
in
gale
products,
in
armco
nor
has
it
been
done
here.
in
fact,
the
board
chose
in
this
case
to
totally
ignore
the
alternate
means
of
communication
available,
used
and
found
effective
by
the
union
throughout
its
16-year
history,
and
chose
to
rely
instead
simply
upon
the
presumption
found
in
stoddard-quirk
and
republic
aviation
and
peyton
packing.
we
would
submit
that
this
is
totally
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
contrary
to
the
duty
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
enforce
that
act
and
foster
collective
bargaining.
i
think
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
founded
upon
the
proposition
that
the
union
will
provide
fair
representation
to
the
employees
it
represents.
otherwise,
we
could
never
really
go
through
the
bargaining
process
or
the
negotiating
process
of
assuming
that
the
union
was
not
going
to
fulfill
its
obligation.
thus,
founded
upon
the
principle
of
fair
representation,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
union
fulfills
its
obligation
to
the
employees
by
bargaining
on
their
behalf
and
entrenches
themselves
as
the
bargaining
representative
by
its
performance
of
its
duties
under
the
act
and
to
the
employees
it
represents
in
this
particular
case.
additionally,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
not
only
the
fair
representation
aspects
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
general
counsel
attempted
to
categorize
or
characterize
the
right
to
strike
as
being
different
from
other
section
7
rights
guaranteed
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
frankly
don’t
think
that
section
7
either
graduates
or
categorizes
any
of
the
rights
under
section
7
into
separate
categories
or
characterizations.
i
do
know,
however,
that
the
right
to
strike
is
dealt
with
specifically
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
whereas
the
right
to
distribute
literature
is
not.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
act
that
per
se
gives
and
fully
leaves
the
right
to
distribute
literature
on
company
property.
it
is
a
right
that
has
arisen
inferentially
as
a
means
of
communication
to
effectuate
section
7
rights.
as
a
means
of
communication,
it
is
therefore,
not
so
unique
or
not
so
fundamental
that
it
cannot
under
certain
circumstances
be
waived.
and
as
i
mentioned
yesterday
on
the
point
of
fair
representation,
the
court’s
holding
in
the
mastro
case
was
based
upon
the
premise
of
fair
representation.
that
fair
representation
theory,
i
think,
should
extend
to
the
collective
bargaining
process.
and
in
this
case,
particularly
when
you
are
looking
at
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
act,
being
to
foster
collective
bargaining
or
the
principle
of
freedom
of
contract.
where
you
have
freedom
of
contract
and
collective
bargaining
being
engaged
in,
that
process
should
go
without
being
interfered
in,
except
where
absolutely
necessary.
i
think
the
court
stated
the
concern
that
it
would
have
with
undue
interference
into
the
collective
bargaining
process
when
they
talked
about
conflicting
rights
in
babcock
&
wilcox.
there,
the
court
was
faced
with
distribution
rights
of
non-employees
as
opposed
to
property
rights
of
employers.
in
that
particular
case,
this
court
held
that
where
there
was
no
necessary
conflict,
there
should
not
be
an
abridgment
of
either
right.
i
think
that
is
particularly
true
in
the
type
of
case
we
have
here
where
we
have
freedom
of
contract
on
one
hand
versus
a
means
of
communication
on
the
other
which
would
lead
me
into
this
court’s
decision
in
nutone,
the
steelworkers’
case.
there,
the
court
was
faced
with
whether
or
not
employers
could
utilize
a
means
of
communication
which
they
prohibited
employees
from
using.
and
in
that
case,
stated
that
unions
and
employees
are
not
guaranteed
every
means
of
communication
simply
because
the
employer
may
utilize
it.
but
that
whether
or
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
committed,
whether
or
not
no
distribution
or
no
solicitation
rules
should
be
invalidated
is
dependent
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
the
court
noted
in
nutone
that
there
was
no
showing
just
as
in
this
instant
case
of
any
undue
influence
or
interference
with
the
employees’
ability
to
communicate
with
one
another.
it
also
stated
to
the
board
that
alternate
means
of
communication
was
highly
relevant
to
a
consideration
as
to
whether
distribution
or
solicitation
rule
should
be
invalidated,
and
stated
that
since
that
issue
was
not
presented
to
the
board
and
no
evidence
taken
on
it,
the
employer’s
conduct
could
not
be
found
wanting.
that
basically
is
what
i
think
the
respondent’s
position
is
in
this
case.
we
do
not
argue
as
the
supreme
court
pointed
out
in
the
nutone
case
that
under
every
factual
situation
or
under
every
circumstance
it
may
arise
there
may
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
committed.
what
we
do
say
is
that
the
board
should
not
presume
away
the
freedom
of
contract
of
the
parties,
but
should
rather
look
to
see
if
there
has
in
fact
been
an
interference
with
the
communication
rights
that
employees
may
have
under
section
7,
and
that
was
not
done
here.
no
analysis
was
made
whatsoever
of
the
alternatives
available
to
employees.
had
there
been,
they
would
have
seen
that
the
evidence
on
the
record
clearly
established
the
fact
that
for
16
years,
the
union
and
employees
had
effectively
distributed
literature
at
company
gates,
that
the
employees
had
the
right
of
free
discussion
and
free
solicitation
on
company
property
which
brings
with
it
the
right
to
sign
union
cards
or
to
sign
petitions,
to
decertify
or
to
start
to
the
decertification
proceeding.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
if
it
had
not
been
bilaterally
agreed
to,
we
would
fall
within
the
republic
aviation
theory.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
don’t
think
i
would
agree
with
that
statement.
i
think
the
--
i
think
again
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
by
anyone.
it
would
apply
equally
to
the
incumbent
as
to
another
labor
union
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
under
the
rule.
under
the
contract
waiver.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
there
would
be
no
distribution
of
literature
allowed
on
company
property.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
under
republic
aviation,
that
rule
would
not
be
valid
unless
special
circumstances
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
think
either
could
have
us
on
the
carpet
on
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
there
were
not
the
waiver
that’s
really
involved.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
waiver
is
inoperative
as
respect
to
other
unions.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
we
think
that
the
waiver
should
be
binded
against
all
employees.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
no,
it
does.
the
waiver
is
only
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
that,
i
think
is
one
of
the
issues
that
this
court
has
to
face
that
the
waiver,
i
mean,
the
rule
--
the
rule
was
in
effect
against
all
employees
for
distribution
of
literature
of
any
kind
on
company
property.
that
was
what
had
been
waived
by
the
union.
that
would
apply
to
any
employee
who
is
going
to
distribute
regardless
of
what
the
cause.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that’s
what
this
rule
is.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
again
i
think
that
may
be
what
we
come
up
with
here
if
you
go
the
route
of
gale
products.
now,
gale
products
split
employees
into
two
groups.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
of
course,
gale
products
was
the
status
of
the
law
at
the
time
the
bargain
was
struck
and
was
the
status
of
the
law
until
the
time
of
this
decision
and
i
would
assume
that
the
parties
would
be
presumed
to
know
their
rights
and
the
law
at
the
time
they’re
sitting
at
the
bargaining
table.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
gale
was
in
1963.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
the
first
contract
was
struck
in
1955.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
before
gale
and
at
that
time
we
would
have
been
under
may
department
store.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
would
be.
that
is
our
interpretation
of
the
rule.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
disagree
with
that
analogy
of
the
situation
mr.
justice
blackmun
for
the
reason
that
we
do
have
full
and
complete
solicitation
rights
and
discussion
rights
on
company
property.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
disagree
with
that
also
from
the
standpoint
of
the
fact
that
for
16
years,
the
history
has
shown
that
the
employees
have
been
able
to
effectively
distribute
literature
at
plant
entrances
and
exits.
and
this,
it
would
seem
to
me
would
--
it
is
what
the
board
has
recognized
in
stoddard-quirk.
in
stoddard-quirk,
they
talk
about
the
discussion
between
or
the
distinction
between
oral
solicitation
or
discussion
and
a
written
communication
and
state
in
stoddard-quirk
that
a
written
communication
is
meant
to
be
of
a
permanent
nature
to
be
read
and
re-read
at
the
leisure
of
the
recipient
and
its
purpose
is
satisfied
so
long
as
it
is
received.
that
even
go
on
to
recognize
and
state
in
their
decision
in
stoddard-quirk
that
plant
entrances
and
exits
are
in
fact
an
effective
means
of
distributing
this
literature.
so,
i
do
not
feel
that
the
dissidents’
right
to
voice
their
opposition
to
the
incumbent
union
is
in
any
way
impaired
in
this
situation.
what
we
have
here
really
is
full
discussion
by
anyone
on
any
subject
that
they
want
within
the
plant
facility,
including
the
ability
to
pass
out
union
authorization
cards
and
get
them
signed
or
a
petition
to
decertify,
as
well
as
the
ability
to
effectively
pass
out
literature
of
whatever
nature
they
may
want
at
the
plant
gate.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
machinists
case
is
totally
contrary
to
the
position
that
we
have
here.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
the
facts
are
considerably
different
in
that
case
and
the
court
there
as
you
will
well
recall
discussed
or
took
the
position
that
there
could
not
be
a
total
waiver
of
rights
in
this
type
of
a
situation.
additionally,
the
court
refused
and
so
noted
in
its
opinion
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
distribution
of
literature
could
be
waived
at
a
time
when
the
bargaining
agent
could
not
be
changed,
which
i
think
throws
it
into
a
somewhat
different
category
than
what
we
are
really
faced
here.
but
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
is
generally
tending
to
go
in
the
direction
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
i
think
really
has
a
fear
that
the
union
will
not
protect
employee
rights
when
there
can
be
a
distinction
between
the
union’s
rights
and
the
employee’s
rights.
that
gets
me
back
to
my
fair
representation
premise
that
i
think
we
must
work
off
of
in
a
collective
bargaining
context.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
i
would
think
that
the
bargaining
agent
being
chosen
as
the
duly
certified
representative
of
the
employees
to
a
duly
conducted
election
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
the
employee
has
chosen
him
as
his
bargaining
representative.
in
other
words,
he
has
the
alter
ego
for
the
employee.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
in
any
case,
the
majority
must
rule.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
would
be
our
position.
so
long
as
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
i
think
gale
products
would
definitely
be
overruled,
but
of
course,
the
board
itself
is
deviating
from
gale
products.
but
republic
aviation
to
me
would
not
be
touched.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
because
of
the
bilateral
nature
and
freedom
of
contract
concept
as
opposed
to
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
it’s
his
primary
duty
to
protect
the
rights
of
his
employees.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
major
considerations
that
has
to
be
given
in
this.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
even
though
some
of
those
may
not
want
to
stay
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct
in
my
opinion
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
waiver
as
was
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
mastro
should
be
given
effect
so
long
as
the
selection
remains
free.
and
what
we
are
really
asking
for
is
for
a
determination
for
the
board
to
make
a
determination
and
not
a
presumption
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
interference
with
that
selection.
now,
if
freedom
to
select
a
bargaining
representative
were
dependent
entirely
upon
the
rights
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
then
surely
we
would
not
have
the
nutone
case,
surely,
we
would
not
have
the
republic
aviation
or
babcock
&
wilcox.
so,
what
we’re
asking
for
is
really
what
i
think
the
court
was
looking
for
in
nutone
when
they
said,
“look
at
the
case
and
make
a
determination.”
my
whole
point
basically
is
that
freedom
of
contract
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
being
one
of
its
primary
purposes,
is
simply
too
fundamental
to
that
act
to
be
presumed
away
as
was
done
here.
and
as
i
stated,
i
don’t
say
that
in
every
circumstance
we
will
not
have
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
--
would
say
conflicts
of
this
kind
is
for
the
board
to
resolve
so
long
as
they
fulfill
their
duty
in
looking
at
the
facts
necessary
to
resolve
that
question.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
we
expect
the
board
to
resolve
them,
but
we
expect
them
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
think
the
scope
of
the
review
would
be
basically
the
same
scope
of
review
that
this
court
exercised
in
babcock
&
wilcox,
and
nutone
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
board
fulfilled
its
role
in
that
regard
by
looking
at
the
relevant
factors
to
make
that
determination.
now,
one
other
point
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
would
--
i
would
not
quite
categorize
it
in
that
--
in
that
term.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
yes,
sir,
now,
i
would
say
this.
one
other
point,
i
think
is
of
concern
in
this
case
is
the
board
in
overruling
its
decision
in
gale
products
has
gone
farther
in
formulating
its
remedy
than
it
has
ever
gone
before
in
this
area
and
much
farther
than
it
went
in
the
fifth
circuit
or
the
eighth
circuit.
in
those
circuits
which
the
board
relies
on
as
supporting
their
proposition,
the
remedy
there
was
limited
to
distribution
or
solicitation
on
behalf
of
any
other
labor
organization
other
than
the
incumbent
or
distribution
or
solicitation
against
any
labor
organization.
now,
here,
they
have
also
gone
that
step,
but
they
have
added
the
additional
step
of
throwing
in
all
other
section
7
rights,
regardless
of
whether
you
have
the
potential
split
between
employee
interest
and
the
incumbent
union’s
interest
as
seems
to
be
feared
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
mid-states.
in
other
words,
under
the
board’s
remedy
as
they
have
fashioned
it
in
this
case,
it
would
apply
to
a
handout
announcing
a
union
meeting.
it
would
apply
to
a
reminder
to
pay
union
dues.
it
would
apply
to
an
announcement
of
the
filing
of
a
grievance.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
that
if
--
if
the
union
can
waive
some
rights
of
employees,
certainly,
they
should
be
able
to
waive
their
own
rights.
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
are
you
talking
about
the
incumbent
or
the
outside?
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
the
outside
union
have
the
rights
i
would
say
as
defined
in
the
area
of
solicitation
and
distribution
as
defined
by
this
court
in
babcock
&
wilcox.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
oh!
no,
sir.
and
there
has
been
no
diminishment
in
the
outside
unions
right
because
under
bab
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
it
bars
them
from
--
on
property
distri
--
employees
from
on
property
distribution.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
oh!
outsiders
would
fall
under
the
babcock
&
wilcox
rule
which
says
that
they
may,
under
any
circumstances
be
barred
to
off
of
company
property
for
distribution
and
solicitation.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
yes,
we
could
bar
them
under
our
waiver
theory.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
well,
there
would
be
no
--
i
don’t
think
you’d
really
face
that
question
out
of
the
waiver
because
of
the
babcock
&
wilcox.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice
which
is
the
reason
for
babcock
&
wilcox.
but
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
presumption
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
mid-states
is
a
very
real
fear
that
the
union
will
not
fairly
represent
employees
in
this
type
of
context,
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
take
a
very
serious
look
at
the
remedy
that
it
has
purported
to
follow
which
is
far
in
access
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit's
holding.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
