mr.
peter
g.
nash
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
you
on
a
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
an
nlrb
order
finding
that
the
respondent
company
had
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
by
maintaining
and
enforcing
a
rule
found
in
this
case
to
have
been
agreed
upon
by
the
incumbent
union
representing
the
employees
of
this
employer,
which
rule
prohibited
the
distribution
by
employees
of
literature
for
or
against
union
representation
during
nonworking
hours
and
nonworking
areas
of
the
company’s
plant.
this
case
then
deals
with
the
basic
right
of
employees
themselves
to
campaign
for
or
against
union
representation
by
distributing
literature
arguing
positions
on
that
subject.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
think
all
part
of
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
believe
that
all
parties
to
this
proceeding
agree
that
but
for
the
issue
in
this
case
which
arises
because
of
the
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
the
employees
would
be
privileged
to
distribute
this
literature
in
nonworking
areas
on
nonwork
time
but
on
company
premises.
the
gut
issue
in
this
case
then
is,
whether
the
fact
that
the
union
and
the
employer
agreed
to
a
“waiver”
of
that
right
to
employees
makes
any
difference.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes.
if
in
fact
the
union
and
the
company
can
waive
this
right
of
employees,
obviously
then
those
employees
would
not
be
able
to
use
company
premises
even
nonworking
areas
or
on
nonwork
time.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
believe
that
it
is
a
statutory
right
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
republic
aviation.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
don’t
believe
that
the
board
specifically
has
dealt
with
this
was
a
first
amendment
right,
although
the
court
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
although
this
court
in
republic
aviation
in
weighing
the
rights
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
and
thus
engage
in
free
speech
against
the
property
rights
of
employees
through
this
right
akin
to
a
constitutional
right,
but
i
think
dealt
with
this
specifically
as
a
statutory
right
protected
by
section
7
of
the
act
and
by
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
not
as
the
way
the
board
has
decided
this
and
that’s
the
way
in
which
i
am
arguing
it
here
today,
your
honors.
the
facts
in
this
case
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself
since
1954
has
provided
that
the
company
can
make
rules
in
order
to
maintain
orderly
conditions
in
the
plant.
the
rules
are
contained
in
another
document
and
the
board
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
were
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
provide
that
there
should
be
no
distribution
of
literature
materials
on
company
property
period.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
at
any
time.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
which
would
indicate
that
the
bulletin
board
was
the
consideration
given
to
the
union
for
their
waiver
of
the
statutory
right
of
employees.
but
there
is
a
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
does
provide
for
bulletin
board
rights
for
the
union.
the
facts
in
this
case
indicate
that
since
1954,
the
iue
has
represented
the
company’s
employees
and
that
since
that
time
the
company
has
maintained
a
rule
which
is
prohibited
distribution
of
literature
anywhere
on
company
premises.
the
board
in
this
case
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
union
had
waived
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
on
company
property
but
found
that
the
right
of
employees
to
make
that
kind
of
a
distribution
was
so
basic
to
the
act
that
it
could
not
in
fact
be
waived
by
the
collective
bargaining
agent
of
the
employees.
the
board
however,
although
it
rationalized
its
decision
based
upon
an
earlier
decision
in
gale
products
declined
to
apply
the
gale
products
remedy
which
had
been
applied
sometime
earlier
in
a
number
of
cases
between
gale
products
in
this
case.
in
that
remedy,
the
board
said
that
the
employer
and
the
union
could
not
agree
to
a
rule
which
prohibited
employees
from
distributing
literature
against
the
interest
of
that
incumbent
union,
but
they
could
agree
to
a
rule
which
prohibited
employees
from
distributing
literature
on
behalf
of
the
union
which
had
presumably
waived
that
right.
the
board
in
the
case
now
before
you,
for
the
first
time
has
said
that
that
that
remedy
that
it
had
provided
before
does
not
make
a
great
deal
of
sense.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
indicates
that
the
right
to
dissent
from
union
representation
is
any
more
protected
than
the
right
to
support
or
defend
you
collective
bargaining
agent.
as
a
consequence,
the
remedy
in
this
case
now
before
you
provided
by
the
board
requires
that
the
company
cease
and
desist
from
enforcing
this
rule
as
to
the
distribution
of
any
literature
for
or
on
behalf
of
any
labor
organization
including
the
incumbent
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit
upheld
the
board’s
factual
finding
supported
by
substantial
evidence
that
there
had
been
a
waiver
here,
but
rejected
the
board’s
gale
product’s
rationale
and
held
that
a
bargaining
representative
has
the
authority
to
waive
on
premises
distribution
rights
of
employees.
a
brief
history
of
the
litigation
in
this
area
maybe
of
some
assistance,
since
1944
and
up
unto
the
gale
products
case
the
board
held
that
and
the
employer
and
the
union
could
waive
the
section
7
rights
of
employees.
in
the
gale
products
decision,
the
board
held
for
the
first
time
that
such
a
waiver
was
in
ineffective
as
i
explained
before,
at
least
as
to
the
distribution
of
materials
against
the
interest
of
the
union
which
attempted
to
waive
this
right.
both
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
have
disagreed
with
the
board
and
have
said
that
the
right
of
management
and
labor
to
freely
contract
is
such
an
important
right
that
that
ought
to
stand
even
against
the
section
7
rights
of
employees
to
distribute
literature.
the
fifth
and
the
eighth
circuits
have
both
agreed
with
the
board
and
have
held
that
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
related
to
the
rejection
or
retention
of
a
collective
bargaining
agent
is
so
basic
to
the
act
that
it
cannot
be
waived
by
the
union
which
might
in
fact
itself
be
benefited
by
that
waiver.
further,
these
courts
of
appeals,
the
fifth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit,
have
indicated
that
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
any
other
alternative
means
of
communication
which
might
or
might
not
be
available
to
the
employees
is
irrelevant.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
like
the
bulletin
board,
that
is
correct.
whereas,
the
sixth
circuit
and
seventh
circuits
have
both
indicated
that
other
alternative
means
of
distribution
may
be
relevant
in
determining
whether
this
rule
encompass
now
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
of
valid
restriction
of
section
7
rights.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
board,
i
believe,
has
been
consistent
in
that
every
case
presented
to
this
court
this
term
has
represented
the
change
in
position
by
the
board.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
g.
nash
including
this
one,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
it
changes
position
back
in
1964
in
gale
products,
and
then
in
this
initially,
and
then
in
this
case
changes
position
as
to
the
union
involved.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that’s
correct
and
then
the
board
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
issue
has
not
been
presented
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
it
was
not
litigated
and
has
not
been
argued
in
any
form
below.
i
might
add,
that
at
least
relevant
to
the
argument
in
the
last
case,
the
mason
&
hanger
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
litigation
in
this
case,
and
in
that
case
--
excuse
me.
in
that
case
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
this
right
not
to
distribute
literature
was
a
protected
right
of
employees,
but
that
the
union
could
waive
its
right
as
to
the
distribution
of
literature
for
its
own
internal
organizational
purposes.
in
the
eighth
circuit’s
--
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
in
the
previous
case
indicated
that
the
eighth
circuit
felt
that
the
employees
rights
to
distribute
literature
on
behalf
on
its
own
collective
bargaining
agent
could
not
be
waived,
and
the
decision
in
that
case
preceded
the
litigation
in
this
case,
so
that
to
the
extent
the
same
kinds
of
issues
might
come
up
in
this
case
as
did
in
the
last
in
those
arguments
before
you,
at
least
the
eighth
circuit
had
indicated
that
there
was
a
feeling
that
employees
rights
in
this
area
couldn’t
be
waived
either
for
or
against
the
incumbent.
in
arguing
its
position,
the
company
in
this
case
contends
that
the
mere
existence
of
an
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
union
concerning
this
distribution
right
is
sufficient
reason
to
change
the
normal
rule
which
would
prohibit
any
restriction
on
employee’s
distributions
of
literature
in
nonwork
areas
on
nonwork
time.
however,
the
company
doesn’t
tell
us
anywhere
why
the
existence
of
an
agreement
ought
to
change
the
rule.
i’d
like
to
direct
my
attention
to
the
reasons
that
passed
by
the
board
and
by
the
courts
as
to
why
the
existence
of
this
agreement
should
make
no
difference.
i
believe
in
dealing
this
issue
it
would
be
helpful
to
start
by
saying
that
we
are
not
really
dealing
here
with
any
literal
balancing
of
the
right
to
contract
against
the
employee’s
right
of
distribution.
clearly
employees
have
the
right
to
distribute
literature
in
nonwork
areas
and
nonwork
time
absent
of
valid
contractual
waiver.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
board
may
properly
find
an
attempt
of
such
a
waiver
to
be
valid.
to
discuss
cases
and
legal
doctrines
upholding
the
right
of
the
unions
and
management
to
freely
contract
really
begs
the
question
before
this
court.
the
whole
issue
here
is
whether
that
right
to
contract
should
apply
to
an
attempted
waiver
of
distribution
right.
if
the
distribution
right
can
be
waived,
freedom
of
contract
doctrine
stands.
if
it
shouldn’t
be
and
can’t
be
waived
as
the
board
has
set,
then
the
right
to
contract
can’t
prevail.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
that’s
the
--
i
think
the
board,
although
didn’t
cite
mason
&
hanger,
the
case
that
i
discussed
before
in
the
fifth
circuit,
indicated
that
the
union
could
waive
its
right
to
distribute
internal
institutional
kind
of
literature,
but
that
--
and
the
union
could
validly
waive
that
right
which
is
its
right,
the
union’s
right
to
acquire
union,
but
that
the
union
could
not
waive
the
employee’s
right
to
distribute
literature
which
related
to
the
question
of
whether
the
employees
wish
to
continue
having
this
union
represent
them,
some
other
union,
or
no
union
at
all.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
record
is
totally
unclear
on
that.
there
is
no
indication
of
what
the
kind
of
material
is
that
the
union
sought
to
have
the
employees
distribute
in
this
case.
however,
the
case
was
tried
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
literature
and
material
which
related
to
this
union
as
the
continuing
collective
bargaining
agent
of
the
employees.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
call
your
attention
to
the
appendix,
page
109
in
which
paragraph
7
of
the
board’s
complaint
alleges
that
the
respondent
“prohibited
employees
from
distributing
literature
on
behalf
of
the
union.”
paragraph
5
of
the
answer
to
the
complaint
admitted
that
particular
allegation
found
on
appendix,
page
116.
no
exceptions
were
taken
by
the
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
contend
not
because
the
trial
examiner
--
the
administrative
law
judge’s
decision
then
trial
examiner’s
decision
in
this
case
based
the
decision
upon
the
gale
products
rule
and
the
respondent
took
no
exceptions
to
the
board
based
upon
the
kind
of
literature
that
may
or
may
not
have
existed
even
thought
the
mason
&
hanger
case
had
been
decided
by
that
time.
and
furthermore,
a
violation
of
the
act
would
occur
without
regard
to
the
type
of
literature
for
it
is
clear
that
the
language
here
prohibited
distribution
of
campaign
type
material
in
nonworking
areas
and
nonworking
time.
the
mere
existence
of
that
agreement
would
itself
be
sufficient
to
sustain
a
finding
by
the
board
of
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation.
the
fact
that
the
rule
had
not
been
enforced
during
that
period
of
time
is
not
determinate.
if
the
mere
existence
of
that
agreement
puts
such
a
burden
on
section
7
rights
of
employees
as
to
itself
constitute
a
violation
of
the
act.
so
that
if
--
first
of
all,
i
argued
that
the
case
was
tried
on
the
basis
if
this
was
organizational
kinds
of
material,
but
even
if
that
were
not
true
the
rule
itself
was
broad
enough
to
constitute
the
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
why
it
wasn’t
put
in
the
record?
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
didn’t
try
the
case
below
but
i
suspect
that
it
wasn’t
in
the
record,
because
of
the
way
in
which
this
case
came
up.
the
union
asked
the
employer
if
he
would
not
waive
this
ban
on
distribution
so
that
employees
could
distribute
literature.
the
employer
said
“no,
i
won’t
waive
the
ban.”
and
the
union
filed
a
charge.
for
that
reason
presumably
the
employer
never
had
the
literature
in
his
hands
nor
did
the
employees
had
the
literature
in
their
hands,
nor
is
the
determinant
that
anyone
had
any
specific
literature
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
believe
you’re
asked
to
decide
in
this
case
the
fact
that
the
union
and
the
employer
had
agreed
to
a
broad
ban
on
distribution
of
organization
material,
makes
no
difference
and
that
that
ban
constitutes
a
section
8
(a)
(1)
violation
by
the
employer.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
don’t
wish
to
speak
for
the
respondent,
but
yes
that
is
the
board’s
position.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
charge
was
brought
by
the
union.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
which
had
signed
the
contract
giving
the
employer
the
right
to
provide
rules
for
in-plant
purposes.
the
--
it
contend
in
this
case
that
they
were
not
really
weighing
the
right
of
contract
against
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute,
but
what
we
really
ought
to
be
looking
at
is
there
anything
unique
about
this
particular
right
of
employees
to
distribute
this
campaign
type
material.
and
secondly,
is
there
anything
unique
in
the
relationship
between
the
union
and
the
employees
that
it
seeks
to
represent
vis-à-vis
this
distribution
right.
i
believe
that
the
board
has
found
this
uniqueness
not
only
in
this
section
7
right,
but
in
this
relationship
a
uniqueness
which
compels,
i
believe,
a
conclusion
that
the
sixth
circuit
is
wrong
and
that
the
board
should
be
sustained
in
its
holding
that
the
employer
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
in
this
case.
this
court
stated
in
its
mastro
plastics
decision
that
employee
rights
may
be
waived
provided
that
the
selection
of
the
bargaining
representative
remains
free
that
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
either
in
favor
of
or
on
opposition
to
union
representation
is
essential
to
the
development
and
the
maintenance
of
an
informed
judgment
on
bargaining
represent
the
selection.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
or
literature
against
the
change.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i'd
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
any
literature
i
guess
which
could
be
fairly
characterized
as
going
to
the
issue
of
choosing,
changing
or
eliminating
a
collective
bargaining
representative,
that
that
--
the
issue
on
the
distribution
of
that
literature
is
so
essential
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
that
this
is
the
kind
of
an
employee’s
section
7
right
that
cannot
be
waived.
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
this
in
its
language
in
the
republic
aviation
case.
clearly
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
mid-states
metal
products
decision
recognized
this
fact
that
the
right
to
freedom
to
organize
belongs
to
dissidents
as
well
as
the
bargaining
agents,
and
limiting
its
exercise
by
non-solicitation
agreements,
tends
to
smother
competitive
union
organizational
activity
and
accordingly
militates
against
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
court
went
on
to
say,
“we
believe
that
the
individual
organizational
rights
at
issue
guaranteed
by
the
act
are
too
fundamental
to
be
contracted
away.”
i
might
add
that
the
union
in
its
reply
brief
filed
last
friday
takes
somewhat
different
view,
but
basically
comes
out
the
same
way.
in
that
brief,
they
argued
that
an
employee’s
section
7
rights
maybe
waived
only
when
that
waiver
furthers
the
purposes
of
the
act.
thus,
the
union
--
thus,
the
act
encourages
industrial
peace,
and
thus
the
board
and
the
courts
have
found
that
the
right
to
strike
can
be
waived
when
as
a
quid
pro
quo
for
that
the
union
and
the
employer
agreed
to
peaceful
arbitration
for
the
resolution
of
industrial
disputes.
however,
the
right
to
select
or
reject
the
union
is
not
furthered
by
waiving
the
distribution
rights
of
employees,
and
thus
under
this
analysis,
that
right
cannot
be
waived.
i
submit
that
under
either
analysis
however,
the
significance
or
unique
type
of
right
with
which
we
are
dealing
here,
the
right
to
distribute
literature
on
these
issues
is
the
right
which
cannot
be
waived.
further
on
analysis
of
the
relationship
and
the
interest
between
the
employees
whose
right
is
sought
to
be
waived,
and
union
which
seeks
the
waiver,
i
believe
compels
affirmance
to
the
board’s
conclusion
that
at
least
that
incumbent
collective
bargaining
agent
cannot
waive
the
individual
rights
of
employees.
the
kinds
of
section
7
rights
which
the
board
and
the
courts
have
found
to
be
waivable
by
a
union
are
those
in
which
the
union’s
interest
and
the
employee’s
interest
may
be
said
to
be
in
harmony,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
right
involved.
thus,
in
the
right
to
strike,
as
i
indicated
before,
that’s
an
employee
right,
but
clearly
the
basic
strength
of
a
union
is
closely
tied
to
and
depends
upon
the
continued
right
of
its
members
to
strike.
thus,
it’s
not
surprising
that
the
board
and
the
courts
have
upheld
the
right
of
a
union
to
waive
the
right
to
strike.
however,
where
the
union’s
interest
and
the
employee
interest
conflict
or
may
not
be
in
harmony,
such
a
waiver,
i
submit
and
the
board
submits,
cannot
be
countenanced.
as
the
board
said
in
its
general
motors
case
in
1966,
“an
agreement
between
a
union
and
an
employer
that
employees
represented
by
that
union
could
not
file
a
petition
to
decertify
a
union
during
the
term
of
the
agreement,
would
not
be
valid.”
the
union’s
interest
and
its
own
self
preservation
would
clearly
conflict
with
the
interest
of
the
disenchanted
employees
who
wish
to
exercise
their
statutory
right
to
file
a
decertification
petition.
just
as
clearly,
i
submit,
the
incumbent
union
should
not
be
allowed
to
waive
their
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
for
or
against
the
representation
of
that
union
during
the
period
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
--
the
right
to
distribute
literature
i
believe
both
the
board
and
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
have
indicated
is
a
right
basic
to
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
act.
the
act
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
employee
rights
to
choose
or
reject.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
right
to
strike,
i
submit,
is
a
vital
right.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
think
that
it
is
as
vital
right,
but
it’s
a
right
of
a
different
character.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
selection
of
the
bargaining
representative.
the
right
to
strike,
i
submit,
goes
--
the
right
to
select
the
collective
bargaining
agent
goes
to
the
very
purposes
of
the
act.
the
right
to
strike,
i
submit,
is
a
right
of
a
different
character.
number
one,
it’s
the
kind
of
a
right
which
a
union
does
not
have
to
waive
without
getting
something
significant
in
return.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
think
as
the
court
indicated
in
its
mastro
plastics
decision
where
the
activity
of
the
employer
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
so
destructive
of
the
collective
bargaining
relationship,
that
the
right
to
strike
may
not
be
presumed
to
be
waived,
and
may
in
fact
not
be
waivable
at
all.
thus,
in
the
mastro
plastics
case
where
the
employer
dismissed
an
employee
because
he
sought
to
campaign
in
behalf
of
the
incumbent
union
where
the
employer
wanted
another
union,
and
the
employee
was
dismissed
and
there
was
a
strike
both
in
violation
of
a
no-strike
clause
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
arguably
in
violation
of
section
8
(d)
of
the
agreement.
this
court
has
held
that
where
that
employer
action
wants
so
to
the
relationship,
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
as
to
attempt
to
destroy
it,
it
may
well
be
that
the
union
may
not
be
able
to
waive
the
rights
of
employees
in
that
circumstance.
i
submit
it’s
the
same
kind
of
situation
here.
the
right
to
distribute
literature
for
or
on
behalf
union
representation
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
collective
bargaining
relationship.
let
me
give
just
a
couple
of
examples.
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
under
the
board
doctrine
as
has
exist
to
date,
employees
may
not
file
a
decertification
petition,
nor
may
they
file
a
petition
on
behalf
of
another
union
except
between
the
90th
and
the
60th
day
preceding
the
termination
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
after
the
end
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
if
the
employer
and
the
union
have
not,
during
that
60-day
period,
entered
into
a
new
agreement.
to
hold
the
union,
an
employer
may
agree
that
employees
can’t
distribute
literature
in
furtherance
of
either
a
decertification
campaign
or
in
furtherance
of
a
campaign
to
change
the
collective
bargaining
agent
during
the
term
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
takes
away
significantly
from
the
right
and
the
ability
of
those
employees
to
file
such
a
petition
within
that
60
to
90-day
period.
if
the
union
interested
in
its
own
preservation
and
incumbency
can
obtain
and
enforce
such
a
waiver
from
the
employer
and
further
can
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
that
employer
within
the
60-day
period
that
can
perpetuate
itself
indefinitely
in
power
to
the
detriment
of
employees.
the
same
kind
of
a
situation
arises
under
section
9
(e)
of
the
act
in
the
de-authorization
proceeding
where
an
election
can
be
held
during
the
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
take
away
the
right
of
the
union
to
make
an
agreement
which
requires
union
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment,
to
say
that
employees
can’t
campaign
effectively
through
distribution
and
furtherance
of
that
kind
of
activity.
as
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
this
would
say,
i
submit
again,
takes
away
that
very
important
right
from
employees.
and
again
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
believe
that
that’s
correct
except
that
if
you
accept
the
gale
products
rationale
which
i
believe
is
correct.
it
doesn’t
make
as
the
board
has
said,
a
great
deal
of
sense
to
say
that
the
employees
can
campaign
against
the
union
but
the
rest
of
the
employees
in
the
plant
who
may
in
fact
wish
to
have
that
union
maintained
as
its
collective
bargaining
agent.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
it
is
not
an
argument
against
incumbency,
but
it’s
an
argument
against
the
interest
of
the
many
employees
who
may
in
fact
wish
that
union
to
remain
their
incumbent.
and
i
think
further,
member
fanning’s
concurring
opinion
in
this
case
has
some
validity
and
that
is,
that
if
the
gale
products
rule
is
in
fact
correct
that
a
union
can’t
waive
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
against
its
interest,
then
you’ve
taken
that
out
of
the
rule
which
the
union
agreed
to,
and
the
union
never
agreed
to
a
rule,
which
said
that
“you
can’t
campaign
before
me,
but
you
can’t
campaign
against
me”.
and
therefore
again,
the
board
has
really
divided
employees
into
two
different
groups
which
doesn’t
make
a
great
deal
of
sense
under
the
act.
so
i
think
if
the
gale
products
rule
is
correct,
then
i
believe
it
to
be
correct,
that
it
makes
a
great
deal
more
sense
to
say
that
you
just
can’t
interfere
with
this
right,
union
and
management,
by
agreement,
can't
interfere
with
this
right
in
any
event
on
either
side
of
the
issue.
i
submit
further
that
the
employer’s
argument
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
alternative
means
of
communication
or
alternative
avenues
of
communication
ought
to
be
reviewed
by
the
board
and
the
courts
i
think
is
a
red
herring.
this
court
has
said
in
the
republic
aviation
case
in
essence
that
there
is
no
right.
there
is
not
effective
alternative
means
of
communication
available
to
employees
leaving
out
strangers
and
outsiders
for
a
moment.
there
is
no
effective
alternative
means
available
to
employees
to
communicate
which
would
take
and
otherwise
invalid
restriction
and
make
it
not
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
court
in
republic
aviation
talked
in
terms
of
solicitation
but
seemed
to
combine
both
literature
distribution
and/or
solicitation
within
that
term.
so
they
were
talking
about
both.
i
believe
that
the
best
discussion
of
the
republic
aviation
decision
can
be
found
in
the
united
aircraft
decision
cited
in
our
brief
of
the
second
circuit
in
which
it
goes
into
a
good
bit
of
detail
as
to
why
as
a
matter
of
law
there
just
is
no
other
effective
alternate
means
of
communication
available
to
protect
the
employee
section
7
rights.
where
that
doctrine
has
arisen
is
in
the
cases
of
outside
union
organizers
who
are
attempting
to
organize
employees,
and
in
all
circumstances
for
those
employees
can
be
prohibited
from
even
going
on
the
employer’s
premises.
this
court
has
said
and
the
board
has
said
that
where
other
means
of
communicating
with
employees
are
so
difficult
that
the
union
can’t
really
effectively
get
its
message
to
the
employees
in
very
limited
circumstances,
the
employer
may
be
required
to
open
his
premises
to
those
outsiders.
but
nowhere
have
the
board
and
the
court
said
that
there
are
effective
alternative
means
to
the
employee
ability
to
distribute
or
solicit
on
premises
during
nonworking
time
and
in
nonworking
areas.
so
i
submit
that
really
the
combination
of
the
very
important
right
involved
here,
plus
the
fact
that
the
union’s
interest
may
very
well
and
most
likely
will
be
in
conflict
with
the
interest
of
the
employees
right
itself,
those
two
things
i
think
dictate
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
the
board’s
award
and
a
reversal
to
the
sixth
circuit’s
judgment
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
you
on
a
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
an
nlrb
order
finding
that
the
respondent
company
had
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
by
maintaining
and
enforcing
a
rule
found
in
this
case
to
have
been
agreed
upon
by
the
incumbent
union
representing
the
employees
of
this
employer,
which
rule
prohibited
the
distribution
by
employees
of
literature
for
or
against
union
representation
during
nonworking
hours
and
nonworking
areas
of
the
company’s
plant.
this
case
then
deals
with
the
basic
right
of
employees
themselves
to
campaign
for
or
against
union
representation
by
distributing
literature
arguing
positions
on
that
subject.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
think
all
part
of
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
believe
that
all
parties
to
this
proceeding
agree
that
but
for
the
issue
in
this
case
which
arises
because
of
the
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
the
employees
would
be
privileged
to
distribute
this
literature
in
nonworking
areas
on
nonwork
time
but
on
company
premises.
the
gut
issue
in
this
case
then
is,
whether
the
fact
that
the
union
and
the
employer
agreed
to
a
“waiver”
of
that
right
to
employees
makes
any
difference.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes.
if
in
fact
the
union
and
the
company
can
waive
this
right
of
employees,
obviously
then
those
employees
would
not
be
able
to
use
company
premises
even
nonworking
areas
or
on
nonwork
time.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
believe
that
it
is
a
statutory
right
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
republic
aviation.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
don’t
believe
that
the
board
specifically
has
dealt
with
this
was
a
first
amendment
right,
although
the
court
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
although
this
court
in
republic
aviation
in
weighing
the
rights
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
and
thus
engage
in
free
speech
against
the
property
rights
of
employees
through
this
right
akin
to
a
constitutional
right,
but
i
think
dealt
with
this
specifically
as
a
statutory
right
protected
by
section
7
of
the
act
and
by
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
not
as
the
way
the
board
has
decided
this
and
that’s
the
way
in
which
i
am
arguing
it
here
today,
your
honors.
the
facts
in
this
case
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself
since
1954
has
provided
that
the
company
can
make
rules
in
order
to
maintain
orderly
conditions
in
the
plant.
the
rules
are
contained
in
another
document
and
the
board
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
were
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
provide
that
there
should
be
no
distribution
of
literature
materials
on
company
property
period.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
at
any
time.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
which
would
indicate
that
the
bulletin
board
was
the
consideration
given
to
the
union
for
their
waiver
of
the
statutory
right
of
employees.
but
there
is
a
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
does
provide
for
bulletin
board
rights
for
the
union.
the
facts
in
this
case
indicate
that
since
1954,
the
iue
has
represented
the
company’s
employees
and
that
since
that
time
the
company
has
maintained
a
rule
which
is
prohibited
distribution
of
literature
anywhere
on
company
premises.
the
board
in
this
case
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
union
had
waived
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
on
company
property
but
found
that
the
right
of
employees
to
make
that
kind
of
a
distribution
was
so
basic
to
the
act
that
it
could
not
in
fact
be
waived
by
the
collective
bargaining
agent
of
the
employees.
the
board
however,
although
it
rationalized
its
decision
based
upon
an
earlier
decision
in
gale
products
declined
to
apply
the
gale
products
remedy
which
had
been
applied
sometime
earlier
in
a
number
of
cases
between
gale
products
in
this
case.
in
that
remedy,
the
board
said
that
the
employer
and
the
union
could
not
agree
to
a
rule
which
prohibited
employees
from
distributing
literature
against
the
interest
of
that
incumbent
union,
but
they
could
agree
to
a
rule
which
prohibited
employees
from
distributing
literature
on
behalf
of
the
union
which
had
presumably
waived
that
right.
the
board
in
the
case
now
before
you,
for
the
first
time
has
said
that
that
that
remedy
that
it
had
provided
before
does
not
make
a
great
deal
of
sense.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
indicates
that
the
right
to
dissent
from
union
representation
is
any
more
protected
than
the
right
to
support
or
defend
you
collective
bargaining
agent.
as
a
consequence,
the
remedy
in
this
case
now
before
you
provided
by
the
board
requires
that
the
company
cease
and
desist
from
enforcing
this
rule
as
to
the
distribution
of
any
literature
for
or
on
behalf
of
any
labor
organization
including
the
incumbent
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit
upheld
the
board’s
factual
finding
supported
by
substantial
evidence
that
there
had
been
a
waiver
here,
but
rejected
the
board’s
gale
product’s
rationale
and
held
that
a
bargaining
representative
has
the
authority
to
waive
on
premises
distribution
rights
of
employees.
a
brief
history
of
the
litigation
in
this
area
maybe
of
some
assistance,
since
1944
and
up
unto
the
gale
products
case
the
board
held
that
and
the
employer
and
the
union
could
waive
the
section
7
rights
of
employees.
in
the
gale
products
decision,
the
board
held
for
the
first
time
that
such
a
waiver
was
in
ineffective
as
i
explained
before,
at
least
as
to
the
distribution
of
materials
against
the
interest
of
the
union
which
attempted
to
waive
this
right.
both
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
have
disagreed
with
the
board
and
have
said
that
the
right
of
management
and
labor
to
freely
contract
is
such
an
important
right
that
that
ought
to
stand
even
against
the
section
7
rights
of
employees
to
distribute
literature.
the
fifth
and
the
eighth
circuits
have
both
agreed
with
the
board
and
have
held
that
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
related
to
the
rejection
or
retention
of
a
collective
bargaining
agent
is
so
basic
to
the
act
that
it
cannot
be
waived
by
the
union
which
might
in
fact
itself
be
benefited
by
that
waiver.
further,
these
courts
of
appeals,
the
fifth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit,
have
indicated
that
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
any
other
alternative
means
of
communication
which
might
or
might
not
be
available
to
the
employees
is
irrelevant.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
like
the
bulletin
board,
that
is
correct.
whereas,
the
sixth
circuit
and
seventh
circuits
have
both
indicated
that
other
alternative
means
of
distribution
may
be
relevant
in
determining
whether
this
rule
encompass
now
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
of
valid
restriction
of
section
7
rights.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
board,
i
believe,
has
been
consistent
in
that
every
case
presented
to
this
court
this
term
has
represented
the
change
in
position
by
the
board.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
g.
nash
including
this
one,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
it
changes
position
back
in
1964
in
gale
products,
and
then
in
this
initially,
and
then
in
this
case
changes
position
as
to
the
union
involved.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that’s
correct
and
then
the
board
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
issue
has
not
been
presented
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
it
was
not
litigated
and
has
not
been
argued
in
any
form
below.
i
might
add,
that
at
least
relevant
to
the
argument
in
the
last
case,
the
mason
&
hanger
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
litigation
in
this
case,
and
in
that
case
--
excuse
me.
in
that
case
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
this
right
not
to
distribute
literature
was
a
protected
right
of
employees,
but
that
the
union
could
waive
its
right
as
to
the
distribution
of
literature
for
its
own
internal
organizational
purposes.
in
the
eighth
circuit’s
--
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
in
the
previous
case
indicated
that
the
eighth
circuit
felt
that
the
employees
rights
to
distribute
literature
on
behalf
on
its
own
collective
bargaining
agent
could
not
be
waived,
and
the
decision
in
that
case
preceded
the
litigation
in
this
case,
so
that
to
the
extent
the
same
kinds
of
issues
might
come
up
in
this
case
as
did
in
the
last
in
those
arguments
before
you,
at
least
the
eighth
circuit
had
indicated
that
there
was
a
feeling
that
employees
rights
in
this
area
couldn’t
be
waived
either
for
or
against
the
incumbent.
in
arguing
its
position,
the
company
in
this
case
contends
that
the
mere
existence
of
an
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
union
concerning
this
distribution
right
is
sufficient
reason
to
change
the
normal
rule
which
would
prohibit
any
restriction
on
employee’s
distributions
of
literature
in
nonwork
areas
on
nonwork
time.
however,
the
company
doesn’t
tell
us
anywhere
why
the
existence
of
an
agreement
ought
to
change
the
rule.
i’d
like
to
direct
my
attention
to
the
reasons
that
passed
by
the
board
and
by
the
courts
as
to
why
the
existence
of
this
agreement
should
make
no
difference.
i
believe
in
dealing
this
issue
it
would
be
helpful
to
start
by
saying
that
we
are
not
really
dealing
here
with
any
literal
balancing
of
the
right
to
contract
against
the
employee’s
right
of
distribution.
clearly
employees
have
the
right
to
distribute
literature
in
nonwork
areas
and
nonwork
time
absent
of
valid
contractual
waiver.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
board
may
properly
find
an
attempt
of
such
a
waiver
to
be
valid.
to
discuss
cases
and
legal
doctrines
upholding
the
right
of
the
unions
and
management
to
freely
contract
really
begs
the
question
before
this
court.
the
whole
issue
here
is
whether
that
right
to
contract
should
apply
to
an
attempted
waiver
of
distribution
right.
if
the
distribution
right
can
be
waived,
freedom
of
contract
doctrine
stands.
if
it
shouldn’t
be
and
can’t
be
waived
as
the
board
has
set,
then
the
right
to
contract
can’t
prevail.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes,
that’s
the
--
i
think
the
board,
although
didn’t
cite
mason
&
hanger,
the
case
that
i
discussed
before
in
the
fifth
circuit,
indicated
that
the
union
could
waive
its
right
to
distribute
internal
institutional
kind
of
literature,
but
that
--
and
the
union
could
validly
waive
that
right
which
is
its
right,
the
union’s
right
to
acquire
union,
but
that
the
union
could
not
waive
the
employee’s
right
to
distribute
literature
which
related
to
the
question
of
whether
the
employees
wish
to
continue
having
this
union
represent
them,
some
other
union,
or
no
union
at
all.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
record
is
totally
unclear
on
that.
there
is
no
indication
of
what
the
kind
of
material
is
that
the
union
sought
to
have
the
employees
distribute
in
this
case.
however,
the
case
was
tried
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
literature
and
material
which
related
to
this
union
as
the
continuing
collective
bargaining
agent
of
the
employees.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
call
your
attention
to
the
appendix,
page
109
in
which
paragraph
7
of
the
board’s
complaint
alleges
that
the
respondent
“prohibited
employees
from
distributing
literature
on
behalf
of
the
union.”
paragraph
5
of
the
answer
to
the
complaint
admitted
that
particular
allegation
found
on
appendix,
page
116.
no
exceptions
were
taken
by
the
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
contend
not
because
the
trial
examiner
--
the
administrative
law
judge’s
decision
then
trial
examiner’s
decision
in
this
case
based
the
decision
upon
the
gale
products
rule
and
the
respondent
took
no
exceptions
to
the
board
based
upon
the
kind
of
literature
that
may
or
may
not
have
existed
even
thought
the
mason
&
hanger
case
had
been
decided
by
that
time.
and
furthermore,
a
violation
of
the
act
would
occur
without
regard
to
the
type
of
literature
for
it
is
clear
that
the
language
here
prohibited
distribution
of
campaign
type
material
in
nonworking
areas
and
nonworking
time.
the
mere
existence
of
that
agreement
would
itself
be
sufficient
to
sustain
a
finding
by
the
board
of
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation.
the
fact
that
the
rule
had
not
been
enforced
during
that
period
of
time
is
not
determinate.
if
the
mere
existence
of
that
agreement
puts
such
a
burden
on
section
7
rights
of
employees
as
to
itself
constitute
a
violation
of
the
act.
so
that
if
--
first
of
all,
i
argued
that
the
case
was
tried
on
the
basis
if
this
was
organizational
kinds
of
material,
but
even
if
that
were
not
true
the
rule
itself
was
broad
enough
to
constitute
the
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
why
it
wasn’t
put
in
the
record?
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
didn’t
try
the
case
below
but
i
suspect
that
it
wasn’t
in
the
record,
because
of
the
way
in
which
this
case
came
up.
the
union
asked
the
employer
if
he
would
not
waive
this
ban
on
distribution
so
that
employees
could
distribute
literature.
the
employer
said
“no,
i
won’t
waive
the
ban.”
and
the
union
filed
a
charge.
for
that
reason
presumably
the
employer
never
had
the
literature
in
his
hands
nor
did
the
employees
had
the
literature
in
their
hands,
nor
is
the
determinant
that
anyone
had
any
specific
literature
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
believe
you’re
asked
to
decide
in
this
case
the
fact
that
the
union
and
the
employer
had
agreed
to
a
broad
ban
on
distribution
of
organization
material,
makes
no
difference
and
that
that
ban
constitutes
a
section
8
(a)
(1)
violation
by
the
employer.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
don’t
wish
to
speak
for
the
respondent,
but
yes
that
is
the
board’s
position.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
charge
was
brought
by
the
union.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
which
had
signed
the
contract
giving
the
employer
the
right
to
provide
rules
for
in-plant
purposes.
the
--
it
contend
in
this
case
that
they
were
not
really
weighing
the
right
of
contract
against
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute,
but
what
we
really
ought
to
be
looking
at
is
there
anything
unique
about
this
particular
right
of
employees
to
distribute
this
campaign
type
material.
and
secondly,
is
there
anything
unique
in
the
relationship
between
the
union
and
the
employees
that
it
seeks
to
represent
vis-à-vis
this
distribution
right.
i
believe
that
the
board
has
found
this
uniqueness
not
only
in
this
section
7
right,
but
in
this
relationship
a
uniqueness
which
compels,
i
believe,
a
conclusion
that
the
sixth
circuit
is
wrong
and
that
the
board
should
be
sustained
in
its
holding
that
the
employer
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
in
this
case.
this
court
stated
in
its
mastro
plastics
decision
that
employee
rights
may
be
waived
provided
that
the
selection
of
the
bargaining
representative
remains
free
that
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
either
in
favor
of
or
on
opposition
to
union
representation
is
essential
to
the
development
and
the
maintenance
of
an
informed
judgment
on
bargaining
represent
the
selection.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
or
literature
against
the
change.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i'd
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
any
literature
i
guess
which
could
be
fairly
characterized
as
going
to
the
issue
of
choosing,
changing
or
eliminating
a
collective
bargaining
representative,
that
that
--
the
issue
on
the
distribution
of
that
literature
is
so
essential
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
that
this
is
the
kind
of
an
employee’s
section
7
right
that
cannot
be
waived.
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
this
in
its
language
in
the
republic
aviation
case.
clearly
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
mid-states
metal
products
decision
recognized
this
fact
that
the
right
to
freedom
to
organize
belongs
to
dissidents
as
well
as
the
bargaining
agents,
and
limiting
its
exercise
by
non-solicitation
agreements,
tends
to
smother
competitive
union
organizational
activity
and
accordingly
militates
against
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
court
went
on
to
say,
“we
believe
that
the
individual
organizational
rights
at
issue
guaranteed
by
the
act
are
too
fundamental
to
be
contracted
away.”
i
might
add
that
the
union
in
its
reply
brief
filed
last
friday
takes
somewhat
different
view,
but
basically
comes
out
the
same
way.
in
that
brief,
they
argued
that
an
employee’s
section
7
rights
maybe
waived
only
when
that
waiver
furthers
the
purposes
of
the
act.
thus,
the
union
--
thus,
the
act
encourages
industrial
peace,
and
thus
the
board
and
the
courts
have
found
that
the
right
to
strike
can
be
waived
when
as
a
quid
pro
quo
for
that
the
union
and
the
employer
agreed
to
peaceful
arbitration
for
the
resolution
of
industrial
disputes.
however,
the
right
to
select
or
reject
the
union
is
not
furthered
by
waiving
the
distribution
rights
of
employees,
and
thus
under
this
analysis,
that
right
cannot
be
waived.
i
submit
that
under
either
analysis
however,
the
significance
or
unique
type
of
right
with
which
we
are
dealing
here,
the
right
to
distribute
literature
on
these
issues
is
the
right
which
cannot
be
waived.
further
on
analysis
of
the
relationship
and
the
interest
between
the
employees
whose
right
is
sought
to
be
waived,
and
union
which
seeks
the
waiver,
i
believe
compels
affirmance
to
the
board’s
conclusion
that
at
least
that
incumbent
collective
bargaining
agent
cannot
waive
the
individual
rights
of
employees.
the
kinds
of
section
7
rights
which
the
board
and
the
courts
have
found
to
be
waivable
by
a
union
are
those
in
which
the
union’s
interest
and
the
employee’s
interest
may
be
said
to
be
in
harmony,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
right
involved.
thus,
in
the
right
to
strike,
as
i
indicated
before,
that’s
an
employee
right,
but
clearly
the
basic
strength
of
a
union
is
closely
tied
to
and
depends
upon
the
continued
right
of
its
members
to
strike.
thus,
it’s
not
surprising
that
the
board
and
the
courts
have
upheld
the
right
of
a
union
to
waive
the
right
to
strike.
however,
where
the
union’s
interest
and
the
employee
interest
conflict
or
may
not
be
in
harmony,
such
a
waiver,
i
submit
and
the
board
submits,
cannot
be
countenanced.
as
the
board
said
in
its
general
motors
case
in
1966,
“an
agreement
between
a
union
and
an
employer
that
employees
represented
by
that
union
could
not
file
a
petition
to
decertify
a
union
during
the
term
of
the
agreement,
would
not
be
valid.”
the
union’s
interest
and
its
own
self
preservation
would
clearly
conflict
with
the
interest
of
the
disenchanted
employees
who
wish
to
exercise
their
statutory
right
to
file
a
decertification
petition.
just
as
clearly,
i
submit,
the
incumbent
union
should
not
be
allowed
to
waive
their
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
for
or
against
the
representation
of
that
union
during
the
period
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
--
the
right
to
distribute
literature
i
believe
both
the
board
and
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
have
indicated
is
a
right
basic
to
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
act.
the
act
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
employee
rights
to
choose
or
reject.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
right
to
strike,
i
submit,
is
a
vital
right.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
think
that
it
is
as
vital
right,
but
it’s
a
right
of
a
different
character.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
selection
of
the
bargaining
representative.
the
right
to
strike,
i
submit,
goes
--
the
right
to
select
the
collective
bargaining
agent
goes
to
the
very
purposes
of
the
act.
the
right
to
strike,
i
submit,
is
a
right
of
a
different
character.
number
one,
it’s
the
kind
of
a
right
which
a
union
does
not
have
to
waive
without
getting
something
significant
in
return.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
think
as
the
court
indicated
in
its
mastro
plastics
decision
where
the
activity
of
the
employer
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
so
destructive
of
the
collective
bargaining
relationship,
that
the
right
to
strike
may
not
be
presumed
to
be
waived,
and
may
in
fact
not
be
waivable
at
all.
thus,
in
the
mastro
plastics
case
where
the
employer
dismissed
an
employee
because
he
sought
to
campaign
in
behalf
of
the
incumbent
union
where
the
employer
wanted
another
union,
and
the
employee
was
dismissed
and
there
was
a
strike
both
in
violation
of
a
no-strike
clause
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
arguably
in
violation
of
section
8
(d)
of
the
agreement.
this
court
has
held
that
where
that
employer
action
wants
so
to
the
relationship,
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
as
to
attempt
to
destroy
it,
it
may
well
be
that
the
union
may
not
be
able
to
waive
the
rights
of
employees
in
that
circumstance.
i
submit
it’s
the
same
kind
of
situation
here.
the
right
to
distribute
literature
for
or
on
behalf
union
representation
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
collective
bargaining
relationship.
let
me
give
just
a
couple
of
examples.
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
under
the
board
doctrine
as
has
exist
to
date,
employees
may
not
file
a
decertification
petition,
nor
may
they
file
a
petition
on
behalf
of
another
union
except
between
the
90th
and
the
60th
day
preceding
the
termination
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
after
the
end
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
if
the
employer
and
the
union
have
not,
during
that
60-day
period,
entered
into
a
new
agreement.
to
hold
the
union,
an
employer
may
agree
that
employees
can’t
distribute
literature
in
furtherance
of
either
a
decertification
campaign
or
in
furtherance
of
a
campaign
to
change
the
collective
bargaining
agent
during
the
term
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
takes
away
significantly
from
the
right
and
the
ability
of
those
employees
to
file
such
a
petition
within
that
60
to
90-day
period.
if
the
union
interested
in
its
own
preservation
and
incumbency
can
obtain
and
enforce
such
a
waiver
from
the
employer
and
further
can
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
that
employer
within
the
60-day
period
that
can
perpetuate
itself
indefinitely
in
power
to
the
detriment
of
employees.
the
same
kind
of
a
situation
arises
under
section
9
(e)
of
the
act
in
the
de-authorization
proceeding
where
an
election
can
be
held
during
the
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
take
away
the
right
of
the
union
to
make
an
agreement
which
requires
union
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment,
to
say
that
employees
can’t
campaign
effectively
through
distribution
and
furtherance
of
that
kind
of
activity.
as
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
this
would
say,
i
submit
again,
takes
away
that
very
important
right
from
employees.
and
again
--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
believe
that
that’s
correct
except
that
if
you
accept
the
gale
products
rationale
which
i
believe
is
correct.
it
doesn’t
make
as
the
board
has
said,
a
great
deal
of
sense
to
say
that
the
employees
can
campaign
against
the
union
but
the
rest
of
the
employees
in
the
plant
who
may
in
fact
wish
to
have
that
union
maintained
as
its
collective
bargaining
agent.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
it
is
not
an
argument
against
incumbency,
but
it’s
an
argument
against
the
interest
of
the
many
employees
who
may
in
fact
wish
that
union
to
remain
their
incumbent.
and
i
think
further,
member
fanning’s
concurring
opinion
in
this
case
has
some
validity
and
that
is,
that
if
the
gale
products
rule
is
in
fact
correct
that
a
union
can’t
waive
the
right
of
employees
to
distribute
literature
against
its
interest,
then
you’ve
taken
that
out
of
the
rule
which
the
union
agreed
to,
and
the
union
never
agreed
to
a
rule,
which
said
that
“you
can’t
campaign
before
me,
but
you
can’t
campaign
against
me”.
and
therefore
again,
the
board
has
really
divided
employees
into
two
different
groups
which
doesn’t
make
a
great
deal
of
sense
under
the
act.
so
i
think
if
the
gale
products
rule
is
correct,
then
i
believe
it
to
be
correct,
that
it
makes
a
great
deal
more
sense
to
say
that
you
just
can’t
interfere
with
this
right,
union
and
management,
by
agreement,
can't
interfere
with
this
right
in
any
event
on
either
side
of
the
issue.
i
submit
further
that
the
employer’s
argument
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
alternative
means
of
communication
or
alternative
avenues
of
communication
ought
to
be
reviewed
by
the
board
and
the
courts
i
think
is
a
red
herring.
this
court
has
said
in
the
republic
aviation
case
in
essence
that
there
is
no
right.
there
is
not
effective
alternative
means
of
communication
available
to
employees
leaving
out
strangers
and
outsiders
for
a
moment.
there
is
no
effective
alternative
means
available
to
employees
to
communicate
which
would
take
and
otherwise
invalid
restriction
and
make
it
not
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
court
in
republic
aviation
talked
in
terms
of
solicitation
but
seemed
to
combine
both
literature
distribution
and/or
solicitation
within
that
term.
so
they
were
talking
about
both.
i
believe
that
the
best
discussion
of
the
republic
aviation
decision
can
be
found
in
the
united
aircraft
decision
cited
in
our
brief
of
the
second
circuit
in
which
it
goes
into
a
good
bit
of
detail
as
to
why
as
a
matter
of
law
there
just
is
no
other
effective
alternate
means
of
communication
available
to
protect
the
employee
section
7
rights.
where
that
doctrine
has
arisen
is
in
the
cases
of
outside
union
organizers
who
are
attempting
to
organize
employees,
and
in
all
circumstances
for
those
employees
can
be
prohibited
from
even
going
on
the
employer’s
premises.
this
court
has
said
and
the
board
has
said
that
where
other
means
of
communicating
with
employees
are
so
difficult
that
the
union
can’t
really
effectively
get
its
message
to
the
employees
in
very
limited
circumstances,
the
employer
may
be
required
to
open
his
premises
to
those
outsiders.
but
nowhere
have
the
board
and
the
court
said
that
there
are
effective
alternative
means
to
the
employee
ability
to
distribute
or
solicit
on
premises
during
nonworking
time
and
in
nonworking
areas.
so
i
submit
that
really
the
combination
of
the
very
important
right
involved
here,
plus
the
fact
that
the
union’s
interest
may
very
well
and
most
likely
will
be
in
conflict
with
the
interest
of
the
employees
right
itself,
those
two
things
i
think
dictate
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
the
board’s
award
and
a
reversal
to
the
sixth
circuit’s
judgment
in
this
case.
thank
you.
