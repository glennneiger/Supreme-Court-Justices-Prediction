chief

e.
burger
well,
does
it
deal
just
with
that
or
where
they
may
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
they
may
do
it
but
where?
chief

e.
burger
that
still
goes
to
where
it
maybe
distributed
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
last
analysis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
start
from
the
(voice
overlap)
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
distribute
it
in
the
abstract
in
the
company
premises.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
asking
whether
you
were
describing
that
as
a
first
amendment
right
independent
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have
in
you
opening
statement
and
that’s
why
i
wondered
whether
you
were
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
appear
to
be,
or
correct
me
if
i
have
the
wrong
impression.
you
appear
to
me
to
be
placing
the
right
to
distribute
literature
on
a
substantially
higher
plane
than
the
right
to
strike.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
the
right
to
strike
a
pretty
vital
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
as
vital
as
the
right
to
distribute
literature
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
right
to
strike
is
never
involved
in
the
problem
of
getting
rid
of
one
union,
but
the
right
to
distribute
literature
can
be
involved,
often
is
involved
in
getting
rid
of
one
union
and
getting
another
one,
isn’t
it?

warren

mr.

chief

not
now,
let
us
know
in
the
morning.

22
minutes

not
so?
