mr.
james
e.
warme
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
taken
some
time
in
my
brief
to
set
out
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
for
the
court
and
i
had
attended
to
convey
to
the
court
that
the
state
does
not
consider
the
equities
on
this
particular
case,
to
be
overwhelmingly
on
its
side.
mr.
spence
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
pleasant
people.
it
has
ever
been
my
duty
to
prosecute
and
i
recognize
the
equities
in
mr.
spence’s
position.
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional.
and
i
think
if
we
concede
the
equities
and
deal
solely
with
the
statute
then,
we
would
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
itself
is
constitutional.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that
was
his
defense.
that
defense
was
rejected
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that
it
was
his
testimony
but
it
was
not
relevant
and
the
--
jury
was
instructed
that
that
was
not
relevant
and
the
court
should
understand
the
statutory
scheme
in
the
state
of
washington,
there
are
two
statutes.
the
first
statute,
and
the
statute
which
we
are
considering
here
is
the
improper
display
of
the
flag
statute
which
is
a
misdemeanor.
there
is
a
second
statute
which
is
a
flag
desecration
statute
in
the
same
chapter
which
is
a
gross
misdemeanor,
more
serious
crime
and
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
cast
contempt
upon
an
american
flag
or
to
defile
an
american
flag
which
would
be
the
case
if
there
were
some
type
of
burning
or
a
dismemberment
which
--
now
that
statute
has
been
construed
by
the
state
of
washington
in
state
versus
turner
to
require
an
intent
to
desecrate
so
that
the
ambiguous
act
of
burning
the
flag
may
or
may
nor
constitute
of
the
flag
under
that
statute.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
and
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
and
it
was
originally
the
position
of
the
--
of
mr.
spence
in
the
trail
court
that
he
was
protecting
under
the
same
doctrine
because
the
display
was
a
benign
display
that
its
intention
was
good.
the
court
said
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
is
not
an
element
and
it’s
not
a
defense.
that
it’s
a
malum
prohibitum
act.
the
improper
display
of
the
flag
and
that
it
is
not
a
crime
in
which
intent
is
an
issue.
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
it
were
a
picture
of
the
flag?
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
it
were
the
flag
itself?
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
it
were
the
flag
itself,
it
would
violate
the
statute,
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
it
would
not
be.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
statute
is
very,
very
broad
as
counsel
has
urged
but
the
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
exactly
right
and
that’s
the
point
i’m
coming
to.
the
statute
itself
is
very,
very
broad.
as
interpreted
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
washington
versus
spence,
the
statute
is
severable
and
we
were
only
dealing
with
an
actual
american
flag
at
the
superior
court
level,
the
court
of
appeals
level
and
the
state
supreme
court
level,
mr.
spence
always
urged
that
the
statute
had
to
be
considered
as
a
whole,
that
you
have
to
consider
the
words,
picture,
representation,
color
scheme,
what
have
you.
the
washington
state
supreme
court
said,
“not
so.”
they
said
on
--
in
their
opinion
and
i’ll
quote
the
words
of
the
court,
“the
only
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
its
at
--
i
believe
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
is
it?
the
only
interdiction
of
free
speech
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
is
that
one
cannot
alter
or
deface
a
flag
of
the
united
states
and
perhaps
other
official
symbols
which
are
not
before
us,
although
it
was
urged
that
this
symbols
were
properly
before
the
court,
they
said,
“no.
in
interpreting
the
statute,
we
do
not
have
to
consider
these
other
parts
of
the
statute
because
we
consider
them
severable,
not
an
integrable
--
integral
part
of
the
statute.
that
has
always
been
the
rule
in
the
state
of
washington,
most
clearly
or
recently
set
out
in
state
versus
anderson
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
is
also
the
federal
rule
on
interpretation
which
is
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
that’s
my
position
your
honor.
that’s
my
position
so
that
the
question
of
the
pictures,
the
representations,
the
buttons,
the
telephone
with
the
red,
white
and
blue
color
scheme
are
not
properly
before
this
court
under
the
statute
because
the
state
supreme
court
has
said,
we
can
consider
those
separately.
mr.
james
e.
warme
they're
not
--
the
battalion
flag?
or
the
american
flag?
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
don’t
believe
they
--
that
they're
generally
attached
to
the
flag.
i
believe
they're
usually
attached
to
the
staff
of
the
flag
itself.
mr.
james
e.
warme
and
they
hang
on
down
and
that’s
not
prohibited
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that
would
be
a
violation,
that
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
there's
a
--
i’ve
never
seen
a
violation
of
it
your
honor
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
don’t
think
it
--
i
think
generally
in
that
type
of
situation
where
you
have
a
military
situation,
there
are
rules
of
protocol
which
are
enforced
by
the
military
itself.
so
i
don’t
think
that’s
--
it’s
a
hypothetical
problem
but
i
don’t
think
its
an
actual
problem.
and
i
think
that
sufficiently
answers
the
overbreadth
argument
of
counsel.
i
think
that
the
state
supreme
court
interpretation
is
such
that
--
that
is
not
an
argument
anymore.
clearly
the
most
overwhelming
part
of
the
argument
is
that
this
statute
does
constitute
a
violation
or
an
infringement
upon
the
appellant’s
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
james
e.
warme
as
applied,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
really
the
heart
of
this
particular
case.
there
are
--
a
number
of
cases
which
deal
the
distinction
between
symbolic
speech
and
free
speech
and
of
course,
or
pure
speech.
in
pure
speech
we
have
the
clear
and
present
danger
test.
in
symbolic
speech,
we
have
u.s.
versus
o’brien
where
the
interests
are
somewhat
different
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
tinker
followed
o’brien.
they
said
there's
no
legitimate
state
interest.
o’brien
was
analyzed,
the
tinker
case.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct
and
i’m
assuming
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
this
is
not
pure
speech
but
i’m
--
lets
first,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
we’ll
assume
that
it
is.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
i
think
it’s
arguably
like
--
and
i
will
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
that
it
is
and
i
--
although
i
don’t
think
that
we
have
to
go
as
far
as
the
cases
which
the
clear
and
present
cases
because
i
think
we
only
have
to
go
as
far
as
o’brien
since
what
we’re
talking
about
is
symbolic
speech
which
o’brien
is
somewhat
limited
but
i
--
but
i’m
going
to
address
myself
to
the
clear
and
present
danger,
this
legitimate
state
interest
in
prohibiting
this
type
of
conduct.
there
are
three
interests
which
i’ve
heard
the
court
discussed
with
counsel
and
i
think
that
that
have
to
be
distinguished.
the
first
interest
is
the
interest
in
promoting
respect
for
the
flag.
that
is
not
a
legitimate
state
interest.
i
conceded
throughout
my
brief
that
the
state
government
cannot
control
people’s
attitudes
about
the
flag.
totally
improper
whether
it
be
through
symbolic
speech
or
pure
speech,
it’s
an
improper
state
interest.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that
would
come
under
the
other
section
of
title
ix,
chapter
86.
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i’m
--(inaudible)
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no,
i’m
not
giving
away
the
defilement
statute
although
i
think
about
that
statute
and
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
thought
about
that
and
i
think
the
answer
is
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
think
the
answer
is
no
to
that
particular
argument.
mr.
james
e.
warme
because
in
that
particular
statute
what
you're
attempting
to
control
is
people’s
attitudes
towards
the
flag.
again,
an
improper
state
interest.
now,
as
that
statute
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
the
second
interest
that
we’re
going
to
talk
--
that
i
was
going
to
talk
about.
that
was
the
interest
which
the
state
supreme
court
found.
they
said,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
flag
and
keeping
it
free
from
external
adornments.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
i’m
not
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
--
i’m
not
going
to
say
that
the
state
supreme
court
is
wrong
but
that
was
not
the
grounds
that
we
urged
before
the
state
supreme
court
and
that’s
not
the
grounds
that
i’m
urging
before
this
court.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
obviously
they
did
your
honor
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
think
doing
that
have
been
--[laughter]
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
you
are
reviewing
the
statute
as
i
understand
it.
its
not
a
question
of
either
my
judgment
or
the
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
and
only
--
in
the
third
state
interest
which
and
the
interest
which
we’ve
always
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
the
second
one
is
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
flag.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
it
means
that
the
state
has
established
the
flag
as
a
national
symbol
and
it
has
the
same
rights
in
the
flag,
for
instance
as
mr.
cohen
would
have
in
his
song.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
don’t
particularly
think
so.
but
i
think
that’s
what
the
state
supreme
court
said
in
its
opinion.
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
the
legislature
said
either.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i’m
not
defending
what
the
state
supreme
court
said.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i’m
not
abandoning
but
i’m
not
--[laughter]
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
we
rely
upon
the
state
interest
of
preserving
the
peace.
this
was
the
same
state
interest
that
was
found
in
radich
versus
new
york,
the
only
other
case
which
came
from
the
supreme
court
but
that
--
that
was
a
case
without
an
opinion
where
the
new
york
court
said
that
there
was
a
legitimate
interest
in
preserving
the
peace.
now,
i
think
that
same
interest
applies
in
the
desecration
statute
and
i
think
if
it’s
a
public
desecration
of
the
flag,
then
the
state
interest
is
there.
if
it’s
a
private
desecration
or
defilement
of
the
flag,
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
i
think
this
answers
mr.
justice
white’s
judgement.
mr.
james
e.
warme
of
preserving
the
peace?
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
appreciate
that
your
honor,
in
reviewing
all
of
the
criminal
laws,
i
don’t
know
that
any
of
them
say
that
the
state
interest
which
we
are
promoting
here
is
written
into
the
statute.
the
determination
of
state
interest
is
a
proper
judicial
determination
and
it's
not
dependent
upon
the
wording
in
the
statute
nor
is
it
a
question
of
fact
to
be
proven
at
the
trial
court.
mr.
james
e.
warme
pardon
me?
mr.
james
e.
warme
they
did
not
read
it
--
no,
they
did
not.
they
did
not,
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
think
--
we’re
talking
about
statutory
interpretation
and
the
question
in
terms
of
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
now,
the
supreme
court
did
not
answer
it
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
right.
there
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
absolutely
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
--
i
believe
that’s
correct.
since
we’re
not
talking
about
a
practical
construction
of
the
statute
and
then
the
rules
of
interpretation
are
not
binding
on
this
court.
what
we’re
talking
about
is
the
underlying
state
interest
which
this
court
has
to
decide.
now,
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
think
so.
i
very
definitely
think
so.
i
think
if
--
well,
i
think
that
this
court
has
consistently
found
or
it’s
the
proper
state
interest
or
lack
of
proper
state
interest
regardless
of
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court,
for
instance,
if
the
state
supreme
court
were
to
say,
there
is
a
proper
state
interest
in
preserving
respect
for
the
flag
under
this
statute,
this
court
would
not
hesitate
to
say,
“no,
that’s
improper.”
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
i
have
set
it
forth
in
my
brief.
i
think
it's
there
to
be
considered
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
the
strongest
argument.
and
that’s
quite
frankly
my
opinion
--
i
feel
that
the
stronger
argument
is
that
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
preserving
the
peace
and
that’s
what
the
statute
stands
for.
mr.
james
e.
warme
even
thought
they
said
that
there
were
other
grounds
that
they
thought
were
sufficient
for
the
statute,
there
were
other
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
james
e.
warme
they
said
--
yes,
they
did.
they
said,
i
don’t
have
the
quote,
but
they
said
that,
“this
nation
has
established
a
symbol
and
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
preserving
its
integrity
and
keeping
it
free
from
exopanding
its
adornment.”
mr.
james
e.
warme
i’ve
never
brought
a
prosecution.
i've
never
seen
a
prosecution
brought
--
i
have
never
seen
the
flag
used
that
way
either?
mr.
james
e.
warme
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
only
prosecution
that’s
ever
been
brought
under
this
particular
statute
in
the
state
of
washington,
that’s
correct.
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
type
of
arbitrary
enforcement
by
prosecutors
or
by
police
forces
although
its
been
asserted
in
the
brief
of
the
appellant
that
such
arbitrary
enforcement
does
exist,
i
have
not
seen
it.
and
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
type
of
proof
of
that.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
certainly
would.
its
--
and
if
--
and
it
would
be
prohibited,
i
think
for
the
same
reason
that
its
an
improper
vehicle,
a
flag
is
an
improper
vehicle
for
conveying
political
or
social
ideas
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct
because
and
i
appreciate
that
on
this
court,
and
in
this
court,
there
are
probably
a
greater
proportion
of
people
who
do
not
attach
the
emotional
involvement
to
the
american
flag
than
the
general
population
does.
i
think
as
you
become
more
and
more
educated
and
you
start
thinking
about
things
like
particularly,
i
suppose
the
rise
of
nazism
in
germany,
you
become
very
suspicious
about
chauvinistic
tendencies
and
as
a
consequence,
more
educated
people
i
think
have
a
tendency
to
shy
away
from
strong
emotional
identification
with
symbols
but
that
does
not
mean,
either
that
it
is
improper
for
people
to
have
that
particular
strong
emotional
identification
or
for
the
state
to
recognize
that
people
have
that
particular
strong
emotional
identification
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
and
the
problem,
the
problem
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
god
save
america
from
richard
nixon
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
--
would
probably
be
a
feeling
that
would
invoke
a
certain
amount
of
ire
in
the
substantial
portion
of
the
population.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
very
--
that’s
not
exactly
correct
your
honor.
if
i
can
explain
the
record
in
this
particular
case
very
briefly,
the
washington
rules
provide
for
a
stipulated
statement
of
the
facts.
mr.
spence
was
indigent.
the
state
agreed
that
we
would
stipulate
to
the
relevant
facts
and
come
to
this
court
on
a
stipulation
of
what
those
facts
were.
the
evidence
at
the
trial
was
that
a
passerby
first
called
the
police.
that
evidence
was
rejected
although
the
state
offered
that
evidence
by
the
trial
court
before
they
even
went
to
the
jury
on
the
grounds
that
that
was
not
a
proper
or
it
was
not
relevant
evidence
to
any
element
of
the
statute
that
it
was
a
malum
prohibitum
statute
and
that
the
actual
response
of
the
people
to
the
statute
was
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
again,
my
point
is
that
the
response
of
the
people
to
the
statute
does
not
determine
the
constitutionality
or
in-constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself
that
that
has
to
be
determined
from
examining
the
statute,
if
we
require
that
for
the
statute
to
be
constitutional,
that
there’d
be
an
actual
present
danger,
then
we
come
in
to
the
position
where
its
only
a
crime
to
yell
“fire”
in
a
crowded
theater
if
the
people
actually
react
violently.
mr.
james
e.
warme
not
a
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no.
i
appreciate
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
it
would
be
hard
to
get
a
fight
but
that’s
not
the
legit
--
well,
the
supreme
courts
said
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
this
was
--
he
was
on
either
the
second
or
the
third
floor.[laughter]
mr.
james
e.
warme
out
his
window.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
he
never
went
out
the
street.
i
think
he
had
it
out
about
five
minutes
when
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no,
it
did
not
but
i
don’t
think
that
in
order
to
--
for
the
statute
to
withstand
constitutional
scrutiny,
there
has
to
be
an
actionable
violence.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
appreciate
your
honor
that
my
position
will
be
much
stronger
if
they’d
only
--
if
one
police
officer,
given
the
man
a
citation.
i
would
prefer
to
be
in
that
position
but
that
still
doesn’t
change
the
fact
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no,
i
would
not
have
sent
three
police
officers
there.
the
--
even
the
police
officers
had
a
discussion
about
whether
to
give
him
a
citation
or
--
but
that
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
statute
itself.
this
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
an
interesting
observation
your
honor.[laughter]
i
would
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no.
the
attorney
general
has
not.
the
attorney
general
has
no
criminal
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
james
e.
warme
the
local
prosecutor
who
is
an
elected
official.
i
would
direct
this
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
halter
versus
nebraska
which
probably
is
in
a
pro
quo
in
the
face
of
the
challenge
to
the
first
amendment
but
is
not
in
pro
quo5020
to
the
observation
that
was
made
by
the
court
at
that
time
in
recognizing
the
dynamic
nature
of
the
symbol
of
the
flag
where
the
court
said,
“recognizing
legitimate
state
interest
that
we’re
urging
here,
insults
to
the
flags
have
been
the
causes
of
wars
and
have
on
occasion
been
punished
summarily
by
those
who
hold
it
in
reverence.”
that’s
the
type
of
situation
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
the
flag
is
not
a
proper
vehicle
for
expressing
certain
types
of
ideas.
and
in
order
to
avoid
the
constitutional
problems
of
deciding
or
favoring
ideas,
the
state
has
made
the
prohibition
absolute.
it
says,
“not
only
can
we
not
express
favorable
ideas
such
as
supporting
the
nation
in
an
armed
conflict,
rallying
behind
the
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no
problem
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
warme
no.
because
the
nature
of
the
offense
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no,
i
--
well,
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
there
are
a
lot
of
peace
symbols
in
seattle
at
that
time.
but
the
nature
of
the
offense
is
not
--
the
nature
of
the
insult
is
not
to
the
policy
so
much
as
it
is
to
the
flag.
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
the
peace
symbol
was
on
his
window
and
there
were
a
--
an
actual
disturbance,
then
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
don’t
know
that
the
first
amendment
would
not
protect
the
display
but
i
think
that
the
police
would
be
authorized
to
take
appropriate
action
to
preserve
the
peace
and
if
that
appropriate
action
were
under
the
circumstances
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
that’s
--
because
what
we’re
talking
about
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
absolutely
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
under
the
statute,
it
would
not
be
a
violation.
mr.
james
e.
warme
under
the
statute,
it
would
not
be
a
violation,
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct
but
i
think
if
the
court
dwells
on
the
facts
that
tends
to
minimize
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
if
we
go
back
to
chaplinsky
where
we
have
the
citizen
calling
the
police
officer
a
goddamn
fascist,
i
believe
was
the
term
that
they
used
there.
this
court
recognized
that
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
the
police
officer
became
aroused,
that
whether
or
not
the
citizen
really
became
aroused,
the
nature
of
the
insult
was
such
that
it
was
the
type
of
insult
likely
to
provoke
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
and
in
the
halter
versus
nebraska
relying
on
the
same
test,
they
said,
“the
used
of
the
flag
is
the
same
type
of
personal
insult
that’s
involved
in
chaplinsky.”
and
i
think
this
is
to
be
distinguished
from
cohen
versus
california
where
they
have
the
young
man
who
took
the
-
wrote,
“f**k
the
draft”
on
the
back
of
his
coat
and
wore
in
the
courtroom”.
no
one,
i
don’t
think
it
was
personally
insulted
by
this
person’s
particular
opposition
to
the
draft.
i
don’t
think
the
draft
is
something
that
people
have
strong
personal
feelings
about.
if
he
had
written
the
same
obscenity,
perhaps
on
an
american
flag
and
substituted
america
for
the
draft,
then
you
would
have
the
same
--
you
would
have
people
who
would
be
personally
affronted
by
this
particular
type
of
obscenity.
and
that’s
the
distinction
that
the
court
made
in
cohen.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
haven’t
thought
of
it
in
that
terms
but
i
appreciate
that
the
supreme
court
may
have
been
thinking
and
just
have
not
gone
as
far
and
said,
the
reason
for
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
flag
is
to
prevent
people
from
insulting
the
flag.
mr.
james
e.
warme
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
james
e.
warme
it
would.
and
the
problem
that
we
have
is
chicago,
the
city
of
--
the
police
of
chicago
versus
mosley
where
they
said,
“now,
you
can
protest
labor
disputes
in
front
of
the
public
schools
but
you
can’t
protest
racial
segregation.”
you
have
a
selective
type
of
choosing
by
the
state,
we’re
going
to
favor
certain
attitude,
we
are
going
to
favor
certain
expressions
and
we’re
going
to
suppress
other.
then
you
have
very
serious
constitutional
questions.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
that’s
the
core
part
of
it
but
i
think
your
honor
that
it's
also
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
that
using
the
flag
even
for
the
purposes
of
what
one
person
may
consider
to
be,
a
benign
purpose
may
be
considered
by
others
to
be
a
cause
of
insult.
as
was
in
this
particular
case,
the
ambiguous
nature
of
the
symbol
in
this
case
could
be
interpreted
either
of
two
ways.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
then
i’ll
submit
my
argument.
mr.
james
e.
warme
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
taken
some
time
in
my
brief
to
set
out
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
for
the
court
and
i
had
attended
to
convey
to
the
court
that
the
state
does
not
consider
the
equities
on
this
particular
case,
to
be
overwhelmingly
on
its
side.
mr.
spence
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
pleasant
people.
it
has
ever
been
my
duty
to
prosecute
and
i
recognize
the
equities
in
mr.
spence’s
position.
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional.
and
i
think
if
we
concede
the
equities
and
deal
solely
with
the
statute
then,
we
would
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
itself
is
constitutional.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that
was
his
defense.
that
defense
was
rejected
as
a
matter
of
law
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that
it
was
his
testimony
but
it
was
not
relevant
and
the
--
jury
was
instructed
that
that
was
not
relevant
and
the
court
should
understand
the
statutory
scheme
in
the
state
of
washington,
there
are
two
statutes.
the
first
statute,
and
the
statute
which
we
are
considering
here
is
the
improper
display
of
the
flag
statute
which
is
a
misdemeanor.
there
is
a
second
statute
which
is
a
flag
desecration
statute
in
the
same
chapter
which
is
a
gross
misdemeanor,
more
serious
crime
and
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
cast
contempt
upon
an
american
flag
or
to
defile
an
american
flag
which
would
be
the
case
if
there
were
some
type
of
burning
or
a
dismemberment
which
--
now
that
statute
has
been
construed
by
the
state
of
washington
in
state
versus
turner
to
require
an
intent
to
desecrate
so
that
the
ambiguous
act
of
burning
the
flag
may
or
may
nor
constitute
of
the
flag
under
that
statute.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
and
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
and
it
was
originally
the
position
of
the
--
of
mr.
spence
in
the
trail
court
that
he
was
protecting
under
the
same
doctrine
because
the
display
was
a
benign
display
that
its
intention
was
good.
the
court
said
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
is
not
an
element
and
it’s
not
a
defense.
that
it’s
a
malum
prohibitum
act.
the
improper
display
of
the
flag
and
that
it
is
not
a
crime
in
which
intent
is
an
issue.
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
it
were
a
picture
of
the
flag?
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
it
were
the
flag
itself?
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
it
were
the
flag
itself,
it
would
violate
the
statute,
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
it
would
not
be.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
statute
is
very,
very
broad
as
counsel
has
urged
but
the
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
exactly
right
and
that’s
the
point
i’m
coming
to.
the
statute
itself
is
very,
very
broad.
as
interpreted
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
washington
versus
spence,
the
statute
is
severable
and
we
were
only
dealing
with
an
actual
american
flag
at
the
superior
court
level,
the
court
of
appeals
level
and
the
state
supreme
court
level,
mr.
spence
always
urged
that
the
statute
had
to
be
considered
as
a
whole,
that
you
have
to
consider
the
words,
picture,
representation,
color
scheme,
what
have
you.
the
washington
state
supreme
court
said,
“not
so.”
they
said
on
--
in
their
opinion
and
i’ll
quote
the
words
of
the
court,
“the
only
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
its
at
--
i
believe
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
is
it?
the
only
interdiction
of
free
speech
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
is
that
one
cannot
alter
or
deface
a
flag
of
the
united
states
and
perhaps
other
official
symbols
which
are
not
before
us,
although
it
was
urged
that
this
symbols
were
properly
before
the
court,
they
said,
“no.
in
interpreting
the
statute,
we
do
not
have
to
consider
these
other
parts
of
the
statute
because
we
consider
them
severable,
not
an
integrable
--
integral
part
of
the
statute.
that
has
always
been
the
rule
in
the
state
of
washington,
most
clearly
or
recently
set
out
in
state
versus
anderson
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
is
also
the
federal
rule
on
interpretation
which
is
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
that’s
my
position
your
honor.
that’s
my
position
so
that
the
question
of
the
pictures,
the
representations,
the
buttons,
the
telephone
with
the
red,
white
and
blue
color
scheme
are
not
properly
before
this
court
under
the
statute
because
the
state
supreme
court
has
said,
we
can
consider
those
separately.
mr.
james
e.
warme
they're
not
--
the
battalion
flag?
or
the
american
flag?
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
don’t
believe
they
--
that
they're
generally
attached
to
the
flag.
i
believe
they're
usually
attached
to
the
staff
of
the
flag
itself.
mr.
james
e.
warme
and
they
hang
on
down
and
that’s
not
prohibited
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that
would
be
a
violation,
that
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
there's
a
--
i’ve
never
seen
a
violation
of
it
your
honor
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
don’t
think
it
--
i
think
generally
in
that
type
of
situation
where
you
have
a
military
situation,
there
are
rules
of
protocol
which
are
enforced
by
the
military
itself.
so
i
don’t
think
that’s
--
it’s
a
hypothetical
problem
but
i
don’t
think
its
an
actual
problem.
and
i
think
that
sufficiently
answers
the
overbreadth
argument
of
counsel.
i
think
that
the
state
supreme
court
interpretation
is
such
that
--
that
is
not
an
argument
anymore.
clearly
the
most
overwhelming
part
of
the
argument
is
that
this
statute
does
constitute
a
violation
or
an
infringement
upon
the
appellant’s
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
james
e.
warme
as
applied,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
really
the
heart
of
this
particular
case.
there
are
--
a
number
of
cases
which
deal
the
distinction
between
symbolic
speech
and
free
speech
and
of
course,
or
pure
speech.
in
pure
speech
we
have
the
clear
and
present
danger
test.
in
symbolic
speech,
we
have
u.s.
versus
o’brien
where
the
interests
are
somewhat
different
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
tinker
followed
o’brien.
they
said
there's
no
legitimate
state
interest.
o’brien
was
analyzed,
the
tinker
case.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct
and
i’m
assuming
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
this
is
not
pure
speech
but
i’m
--
lets
first,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
we’ll
assume
that
it
is.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
i
think
it’s
arguably
like
--
and
i
will
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
that
it
is
and
i
--
although
i
don’t
think
that
we
have
to
go
as
far
as
the
cases
which
the
clear
and
present
cases
because
i
think
we
only
have
to
go
as
far
as
o’brien
since
what
we’re
talking
about
is
symbolic
speech
which
o’brien
is
somewhat
limited
but
i
--
but
i’m
going
to
address
myself
to
the
clear
and
present
danger,
this
legitimate
state
interest
in
prohibiting
this
type
of
conduct.
there
are
three
interests
which
i’ve
heard
the
court
discussed
with
counsel
and
i
think
that
that
have
to
be
distinguished.
the
first
interest
is
the
interest
in
promoting
respect
for
the
flag.
that
is
not
a
legitimate
state
interest.
i
conceded
throughout
my
brief
that
the
state
government
cannot
control
people’s
attitudes
about
the
flag.
totally
improper
whether
it
be
through
symbolic
speech
or
pure
speech,
it’s
an
improper
state
interest.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that
would
come
under
the
other
section
of
title
ix,
chapter
86.
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i’m
--(inaudible)
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no,
i’m
not
giving
away
the
defilement
statute
although
i
think
about
that
statute
and
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
thought
about
that
and
i
think
the
answer
is
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
think
the
answer
is
no
to
that
particular
argument.
mr.
james
e.
warme
because
in
that
particular
statute
what
you're
attempting
to
control
is
people’s
attitudes
towards
the
flag.
again,
an
improper
state
interest.
now,
as
that
statute
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
the
second
interest
that
we’re
going
to
talk
--
that
i
was
going
to
talk
about.
that
was
the
interest
which
the
state
supreme
court
found.
they
said,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
flag
and
keeping
it
free
from
external
adornments.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
i’m
not
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
--
i’m
not
going
to
say
that
the
state
supreme
court
is
wrong
but
that
was
not
the
grounds
that
we
urged
before
the
state
supreme
court
and
that’s
not
the
grounds
that
i’m
urging
before
this
court.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
obviously
they
did
your
honor
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
think
doing
that
have
been
--[laughter]
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
you
are
reviewing
the
statute
as
i
understand
it.
its
not
a
question
of
either
my
judgment
or
the
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
and
only
--
in
the
third
state
interest
which
and
the
interest
which
we’ve
always
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
the
second
one
is
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
flag.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
it
means
that
the
state
has
established
the
flag
as
a
national
symbol
and
it
has
the
same
rights
in
the
flag,
for
instance
as
mr.
cohen
would
have
in
his
song.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
don’t
particularly
think
so.
but
i
think
that’s
what
the
state
supreme
court
said
in
its
opinion.
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
what
the
legislature
said
either.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i’m
not
defending
what
the
state
supreme
court
said.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i’m
not
abandoning
but
i’m
not
--[laughter]
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
we
rely
upon
the
state
interest
of
preserving
the
peace.
this
was
the
same
state
interest
that
was
found
in
radich
versus
new
york,
the
only
other
case
which
came
from
the
supreme
court
but
that
--
that
was
a
case
without
an
opinion
where
the
new
york
court
said
that
there
was
a
legitimate
interest
in
preserving
the
peace.
now,
i
think
that
same
interest
applies
in
the
desecration
statute
and
i
think
if
it’s
a
public
desecration
of
the
flag,
then
the
state
interest
is
there.
if
it’s
a
private
desecration
or
defilement
of
the
flag,
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
i
think
this
answers
mr.
justice
white’s
judgement.
mr.
james
e.
warme
of
preserving
the
peace?
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
appreciate
that
your
honor,
in
reviewing
all
of
the
criminal
laws,
i
don’t
know
that
any
of
them
say
that
the
state
interest
which
we
are
promoting
here
is
written
into
the
statute.
the
determination
of
state
interest
is
a
proper
judicial
determination
and
it's
not
dependent
upon
the
wording
in
the
statute
nor
is
it
a
question
of
fact
to
be
proven
at
the
trial
court.
mr.
james
e.
warme
pardon
me?
mr.
james
e.
warme
they
did
not
read
it
--
no,
they
did
not.
they
did
not,
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
think
--
we’re
talking
about
statutory
interpretation
and
the
question
in
terms
of
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
now,
the
supreme
court
did
not
answer
it
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
right.
there
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
absolutely
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
--
i
believe
that’s
correct.
since
we’re
not
talking
about
a
practical
construction
of
the
statute
and
then
the
rules
of
interpretation
are
not
binding
on
this
court.
what
we’re
talking
about
is
the
underlying
state
interest
which
this
court
has
to
decide.
now,
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
think
so.
i
very
definitely
think
so.
i
think
if
--
well,
i
think
that
this
court
has
consistently
found
or
it’s
the
proper
state
interest
or
lack
of
proper
state
interest
regardless
of
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court,
for
instance,
if
the
state
supreme
court
were
to
say,
there
is
a
proper
state
interest
in
preserving
respect
for
the
flag
under
this
statute,
this
court
would
not
hesitate
to
say,
“no,
that’s
improper.”
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
i
have
set
it
forth
in
my
brief.
i
think
it's
there
to
be
considered
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
the
strongest
argument.
and
that’s
quite
frankly
my
opinion
--
i
feel
that
the
stronger
argument
is
that
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
preserving
the
peace
and
that’s
what
the
statute
stands
for.
mr.
james
e.
warme
even
thought
they
said
that
there
were
other
grounds
that
they
thought
were
sufficient
for
the
statute,
there
were
other
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
james
e.
warme
they
said
--
yes,
they
did.
they
said,
i
don’t
have
the
quote,
but
they
said
that,
“this
nation
has
established
a
symbol
and
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
preserving
its
integrity
and
keeping
it
free
from
exopanding
its
adornment.”
mr.
james
e.
warme
i’ve
never
brought
a
prosecution.
i've
never
seen
a
prosecution
brought
--
i
have
never
seen
the
flag
used
that
way
either?
mr.
james
e.
warme
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
only
prosecution
that’s
ever
been
brought
under
this
particular
statute
in
the
state
of
washington,
that’s
correct.
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
type
of
arbitrary
enforcement
by
prosecutors
or
by
police
forces
although
its
been
asserted
in
the
brief
of
the
appellant
that
such
arbitrary
enforcement
does
exist,
i
have
not
seen
it.
and
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
type
of
proof
of
that.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
certainly
would.
its
--
and
if
--
and
it
would
be
prohibited,
i
think
for
the
same
reason
that
its
an
improper
vehicle,
a
flag
is
an
improper
vehicle
for
conveying
political
or
social
ideas
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct
because
and
i
appreciate
that
on
this
court,
and
in
this
court,
there
are
probably
a
greater
proportion
of
people
who
do
not
attach
the
emotional
involvement
to
the
american
flag
than
the
general
population
does.
i
think
as
you
become
more
and
more
educated
and
you
start
thinking
about
things
like
particularly,
i
suppose
the
rise
of
nazism
in
germany,
you
become
very
suspicious
about
chauvinistic
tendencies
and
as
a
consequence,
more
educated
people
i
think
have
a
tendency
to
shy
away
from
strong
emotional
identification
with
symbols
but
that
does
not
mean,
either
that
it
is
improper
for
people
to
have
that
particular
strong
emotional
identification
or
for
the
state
to
recognize
that
people
have
that
particular
strong
emotional
identification
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
and
the
problem,
the
problem
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
god
save
america
from
richard
nixon
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
--
would
probably
be
a
feeling
that
would
invoke
a
certain
amount
of
ire
in
the
substantial
portion
of
the
population.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
very
--
that’s
not
exactly
correct
your
honor.
if
i
can
explain
the
record
in
this
particular
case
very
briefly,
the
washington
rules
provide
for
a
stipulated
statement
of
the
facts.
mr.
spence
was
indigent.
the
state
agreed
that
we
would
stipulate
to
the
relevant
facts
and
come
to
this
court
on
a
stipulation
of
what
those
facts
were.
the
evidence
at
the
trial
was
that
a
passerby
first
called
the
police.
that
evidence
was
rejected
although
the
state
offered
that
evidence
by
the
trial
court
before
they
even
went
to
the
jury
on
the
grounds
that
that
was
not
a
proper
or
it
was
not
relevant
evidence
to
any
element
of
the
statute
that
it
was
a
malum
prohibitum
statute
and
that
the
actual
response
of
the
people
to
the
statute
was
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
again,
my
point
is
that
the
response
of
the
people
to
the
statute
does
not
determine
the
constitutionality
or
in-constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself
that
that
has
to
be
determined
from
examining
the
statute,
if
we
require
that
for
the
statute
to
be
constitutional,
that
there’d
be
an
actual
present
danger,
then
we
come
in
to
the
position
where
its
only
a
crime
to
yell
“fire”
in
a
crowded
theater
if
the
people
actually
react
violently.
mr.
james
e.
warme
not
a
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no.
i
appreciate
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
it
would
be
hard
to
get
a
fight
but
that’s
not
the
legit
--
well,
the
supreme
courts
said
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
this
was
--
he
was
on
either
the
second
or
the
third
floor.[laughter]
mr.
james
e.
warme
out
his
window.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
he
never
went
out
the
street.
i
think
he
had
it
out
about
five
minutes
when
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no,
it
did
not
but
i
don’t
think
that
in
order
to
--
for
the
statute
to
withstand
constitutional
scrutiny,
there
has
to
be
an
actionable
violence.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
appreciate
your
honor
that
my
position
will
be
much
stronger
if
they’d
only
--
if
one
police
officer,
given
the
man
a
citation.
i
would
prefer
to
be
in
that
position
but
that
still
doesn’t
change
the
fact
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no,
i
would
not
have
sent
three
police
officers
there.
the
--
even
the
police
officers
had
a
discussion
about
whether
to
give
him
a
citation
or
--
but
that
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
statute
itself.
this
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
an
interesting
observation
your
honor.[laughter]
i
would
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no.
the
attorney
general
has
not.
the
attorney
general
has
no
criminal
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
james
e.
warme
the
local
prosecutor
who
is
an
elected
official.
i
would
direct
this
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
halter
versus
nebraska
which
probably
is
in
a
pro
quo
in
the
face
of
the
challenge
to
the
first
amendment
but
is
not
in
pro
quo5020
to
the
observation
that
was
made
by
the
court
at
that
time
in
recognizing
the
dynamic
nature
of
the
symbol
of
the
flag
where
the
court
said,
“recognizing
legitimate
state
interest
that
we’re
urging
here,
insults
to
the
flags
have
been
the
causes
of
wars
and
have
on
occasion
been
punished
summarily
by
those
who
hold
it
in
reverence.”
that’s
the
type
of
situation
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
the
flag
is
not
a
proper
vehicle
for
expressing
certain
types
of
ideas.
and
in
order
to
avoid
the
constitutional
problems
of
deciding
or
favoring
ideas,
the
state
has
made
the
prohibition
absolute.
it
says,
“not
only
can
we
not
express
favorable
ideas
such
as
supporting
the
nation
in
an
armed
conflict,
rallying
behind
the
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no
problem
at
all.
mr.
james
e.
warme
no.
because
the
nature
of
the
offense
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
no,
i
--
well,
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
there
are
a
lot
of
peace
symbols
in
seattle
at
that
time.
but
the
nature
of
the
offense
is
not
--
the
nature
of
the
insult
is
not
to
the
policy
so
much
as
it
is
to
the
flag.
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
the
peace
symbol
was
on
his
window
and
there
were
a
--
an
actual
disturbance,
then
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
don’t
know
that
the
first
amendment
would
not
protect
the
display
but
i
think
that
the
police
would
be
authorized
to
take
appropriate
action
to
preserve
the
peace
and
if
that
appropriate
action
were
under
the
circumstances
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
that’s
--
because
what
we’re
talking
about
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
absolutely
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
under
the
statute,
it
would
not
be
a
violation.
mr.
james
e.
warme
under
the
statute,
it
would
not
be
a
violation,
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
if
--
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
warme
that’s
correct
but
i
think
if
the
court
dwells
on
the
facts
that
tends
to
minimize
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
if
we
go
back
to
chaplinsky
where
we
have
the
citizen
calling
the
police
officer
a
goddamn
fascist,
i
believe
was
the
term
that
they
used
there.
this
court
recognized
that
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
the
police
officer
became
aroused,
that
whether
or
not
the
citizen
really
became
aroused,
the
nature
of
the
insult
was
such
that
it
was
the
type
of
insult
likely
to
provoke
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
and
in
the
halter
versus
nebraska
relying
on
the
same
test,
they
said,
“the
used
of
the
flag
is
the
same
type
of
personal
insult
that’s
involved
in
chaplinsky.”
and
i
think
this
is
to
be
distinguished
from
cohen
versus
california
where
they
have
the
young
man
who
took
the
-
wrote,
“f**k
the
draft”
on
the
back
of
his
coat
and
wore
in
the
courtroom”.
no
one,
i
don’t
think
it
was
personally
insulted
by
this
person’s
particular
opposition
to
the
draft.
i
don’t
think
the
draft
is
something
that
people
have
strong
personal
feelings
about.
if
he
had
written
the
same
obscenity,
perhaps
on
an
american
flag
and
substituted
america
for
the
draft,
then
you
would
have
the
same
--
you
would
have
people
who
would
be
personally
affronted
by
this
particular
type
of
obscenity.
and
that’s
the
distinction
that
the
court
made
in
cohen.
mr.
james
e.
warme
i
haven’t
thought
of
it
in
that
terms
but
i
appreciate
that
the
supreme
court
may
have
been
thinking
and
just
have
not
gone
as
far
and
said,
the
reason
for
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
flag
is
to
prevent
people
from
insulting
the
flag.
mr.
james
e.
warme
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
james
e.
warme
it
would.
and
the
problem
that
we
have
is
chicago,
the
city
of
--
the
police
of
chicago
versus
mosley
where
they
said,
“now,
you
can
protest
labor
disputes
in
front
of
the
public
schools
but
you
can’t
protest
racial
segregation.”
you
have
a
selective
type
of
choosing
by
the
state,
we’re
going
to
favor
certain
attitude,
we
are
going
to
favor
certain
expressions
and
we’re
going
to
suppress
other.
then
you
have
very
serious
constitutional
questions.
mr.
james
e.
warme
well,
that’s
the
core
part
of
it
but
i
think
your
honor
that
it's
also
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
that
using
the
flag
even
for
the
purposes
of
what
one
person
may
consider
to
be,
a
benign
purpose
may
be
considered
by
others
to
be
a
cause
of
insult.
as
was
in
this
particular
case,
the
ambiguous
nature
of
the
symbol
in
this
case
could
be
interpreted
either
of
two
ways.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
then
i’ll
submit
my
argument.
