justice
thurgood

if
the
statute
is
improper
to
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
didn’t
have
the
word
improper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
--[laughter]
i
would
suspect
that
we
could
uphold
the
statute
and
still
let
that
flag
stay
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
suspect
we
could
uphold
the
washington
statute,
it
would
not
apply
to
that
flag.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn’t
the
statute
say
that
you
couldn’t
have
a
fringe
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
design
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
the
top
of
the
flagpole,
is
that
bad
too?
is
that
bad
with
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
is
that
your
statute
was
in
the
man’s
front
--
and
was
thing
so
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
number
two,
how
many
people
do
you
say
at
the
state
of
washington
knew
what
he
meant
when
he
put
the
peace
symbol
on
the
flag?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would've
known
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
in
the
world
could
he
know
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could've
been
protesting
the
invasion
of
timbuktu.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
you
put
a
peace
symbol
on
the
flag
there,
what
would
it
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
it
was
displayed
outside
of
this
building
across
the
street
on
--
an
the
american
flag
right
now,
what
would
the
message
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
have
the
slightest
idea
what
it
would
look.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
think
there
are
some
people
who
write
and
they
didn't
know
what
the
peace
symbol
meant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
some
people
other
than
police
officers
in
washington
might
not
have
known
what
the
peace
symbol
meant
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
you
agree
it
was
a
clear
message.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
he
meant
to
say?
i
would
call
it
about
what
people
understood
him
to
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
might
be
peace
in
washington
d.c.?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
flag
of
the
regiment,
it
has
ribbons
on
it,
that
will
be
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
american
flag
which
the
battalion
puts
on
--
at
all
of
its
battle
ribbons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
hang
on
down
(voice

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
they
were
attached
to
the
flag.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
like
to
see
the
state
of
washington
try
to
enforce
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
state
supreme
court
didn’t?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
state
supreme
court
read
it
in
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
can
we
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
admit
that
you
urged
this
on
your
supreme
court
and
your
supreme
court
rejected
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn’t
they
answer
at
all?
well,
they
didn’t
accept
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice

--
that
even
though
they
refused
to
accept
it.

he

justice
thurgood

(inaudible).
justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

suppose
the

was

wasn’t
attached

justice
thurgood

that’s
right.
justice
thurgood

but
all

there's
nothing
you
could
do
