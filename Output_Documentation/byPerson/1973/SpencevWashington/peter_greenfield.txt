mr.
peter
greenfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
to
give
some
perspective
to
the
question
before
the
court
this
morning,
i
will
relate
a
piece
of
history
that
i
learned
just
in
the
last
week
involving
president
lincoln’s
favorite
clown,
it
was
discussed
in
an
article
that
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
magazine
of
december
30th.
the
clown
in
question
was
named
dan
rice
and
he
dressed
himself
up
in
an
outfit
that
was
designed
to
look
like
the
american
flag.
it
was
in
a
reverent
expression.
i
think
in
the
tradition
of
people
like
mr.
goguen
whose
case
was
argued
only
recently
before
this
court.
mr.
rice
called
himself
uncle
sam
and
the
image
which
he
conveyed
has
remained
with
us
in
various
forms
and
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
uncle
sam
has
been
in
cartoons
and
at
the
head
of
parades,
a
violator
repeatedly
of
the
kind
of
statute
which
is
before
the
court
this
morning.
this
case
comes
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
my
client,
harold
spence
was
convicted
for
flying
a
privately
owned
american
flag
with
a
black
cape
peace
symbol,
superimposed
on
it
from
the
window
of
his
apartment
in
seattle,
washington.
mr.
peter
greenfield
mr.
rice
was
the
clown
whose
--
at
least
according
to
the
new
york
times
was
president
lincoln’s
favorite.
mr.
peter
greenfield
he’s
not
a
party
to
this
action
your
honor.[laughter]
i
believe
his
reign
extended
in
the
mid
19th
century.
mr.
peter
greenfield
no,
he
isn’t.
he
was
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i’m
not
sure
whether
that
appears
in
the
record
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
in
fact
was
suspended
upside
down.
that
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
statute
here
at
issue.
as
i
understand
it,
an
upside
down
flag
is
traditionally
a
symbol
of
distress
and
i
think
it
was
consistent
with
the
message
which
mr.
spence
was
attempting
to
convey.
however
he
was
not
convicted
as
a
result
of
the
position
of
the
flag
but
merely
because
there
was
something
superimposed
on
the
flag
and
that
something
could
have
been
under
the
broadly
word
at
statute
of
our
state,
words
such
as
i
love
america,
the
content
would
not
have
been
of
consequence.
this
case
doesn’t
have
any
of
the
complicating
features
that
some
recent
political
protest
cases
have,
that
have
been
before
this
court.
it
doesn’t
involve
as
the
tinker
case
did.
the
black
arm
bands
that
were
worn
in
a
school
room,
that
the
location,
that
was
across
of
some
concern
unlike
the
papish
case,
the
political
cartoon
that
was
published
on
college
campus.
it
doesn’t
involve
any
question
of
the
right
of
(inaudible)
campuses
to
state
or
regulate
activity
on
college
campuses.
it
doesn’t
involve
any
trespass
on
private
or
public
property
or
any
destruction
of
property
or
government
records
as
was
the
case
in
united
states
versus
o’brien.
the
only
factor
which
makes
this
case
at
all
complicated
or
indeed
at
all
interest
in
this
that
it
involved
an
american
flag.
and
as
to
whether
or
not
that
makes
the
case
difficult.
i
would
remind
the
court
of
the
observation
of
mt.
justice
jackson
in
west
virginia
versus
barnette,
that
is
that
the
underlying
principles
arising
out
of
the
first
amendment
are
simple
ones
and
it's
only
--
the
only
problem
on
a
case
like
this
is
going
beyond
the
emotional
preconceptions
that
we
have
when
our
flag
is
involved
in
getting
to
those
fundamental
and
basically
simple
principles.
basically,
there
are
two
kinds
of
statutes
that
are
currently
the
subject
of
a
great
deal
of
litigation
throughout
the
country,
criminal
statutes
promulgated
by
the
states
and
referring
to
flags.
they
are
the
desecration
statutes,
the
kind
of
statute
that
were
--
was
at
issue
in
the
goguen
case
which
punishes
behavior
which
reflects
some
kind
of
contempt
or
intentional
desecration
of
the
flag
either
by
words
or
by
some
other
form
of
conduct.
that
kind
of
statute
is
not
at
issue
here
today.
washington
statute
which
--
under
which
mr.
spence
was
prosecuted
deals
with
what
is
referred
to
in
the
title
as
“improper
use
of
the
flag.”
and
i
should
start
by
saying
that
the
flag
is
defined
very
broadly
in
the
statute.
a
flag,
i
believe
the
definition
says
flag
etcetera
defined,
refers
to
any
flag,
emblem,
a
shield
or
color
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
washington
or
any
picture
or
representation
of
the
flag
of
any
substance
that
is
of
metal
or
stone.
the
buttons
which
have
flags
on
them
and
have
the
face
of
a
political
candidate
are
equally
punishable
under
washington
statute
as
was
--
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington
the
conduct
engaged
in
by
mr.
spence.
and
once
again
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
right.
the
statute
applies
both
to
the
state
flag
and
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
state
flag
has
been
at
issue.
i
don’t
know
whether
the
average
citizen
of
the
state
washington
could
recognize
or
describe
the
flag
of
the
state
of
washington
if
asked.
mr.
peter
greenfield
pardon?
mr.
peter
greenfield
i
as
--
i
certainly
assume
that
that’s
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
if
the
average
citizen
of
washington
were
asked
whether
the
flag
of
our
state
is
a
green
flag
with
the
face
of
the
first
president
on
it
or
the
picture
of
mount
rainier
or
a
pine
tree
that
the
distribution
of
answers
would
probably
be
approximately
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i’ll
have
to
defer
to
mr.
warne(ph)
for
that
to
answer
your
honor.
i’m
sorry,
i
can’t.
mr.
peter
greenfield
right.
i
don’t
think
there's
any
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
right.
i
don’t
believe
there's
any
question
that
this
was
a
flag
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
depends
on
some
other
things.
mr.
peter
greenfield
which
are
in
fact
much
more
complicated
because
judges
including
judge
lumbard
of
second
circuit
in
long
island
moratorium
committee
versus
cahn,
perhaps
the
most
detailed
explication
of
the
statute
of
this
sort
and
a
case
that’s
pending
before
this
court,
that
is
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
was
filed
several
years
ago,
suggested
that
one
could
not
read
a
statute
of
this
sort
literally
because
the
results
were
too
bizarre
and
consequently
we
get
into
something
which
i
think
is
fair
to
characterize
as
symbolic
speech
as
distinguished
from
literal
speech
in
a
statute
which
presents
very
serious
problems.
the
kinds
of
examples
which
that
chief
judge
lumbard
gave
of
what
seemed
to
him
to
be
obvious
violations
of
the
new
york
statute
which
is
very
similar
to
the
washington
statute
or
such
things
as
the
buttons
which
every
presidential
candidate
in
recent
history
including
several
chief
justices
of
this
court
have
displayed
that
is,
pictures
of
the
american
flag
or
part
of
it
with
their
faces
superimposed,
it
would
go
to
a
--
the
various
magazine
covers
that
have
--
almost
every
magazine
of
national
circulation
in
the
last
few
years
had
one
or
another
with
a
flag
or
part
of
it
and
the
title
of
the
magazine
in
various
stories
superimposed.
many
examples
of
this
kinds
of
seemingly
patent
violations
of
statutes
of
this
sort
occur
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
filed
with
this
court,
the
reply
brief
for
appellant
in
radich
versus
new
york.
that
is
number
169,
october
term,
1970.
i
think
thought
that
we
all
have
some
familiarity
with
these
kinds
of
things.
i
noticed
on
the
plane
flying
east,
united
airlines
distributed
to
me
a
brochure
with
advertising
a
telephone,
i’ll
leave
a
copy
of
this
with
the
clerk
if
anyone
would
like
to
see
it,
a
patent
violation
of
the
statute.
this
--
the
breadth
of
the
statute
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
statute
prohibits
the
placing
of
any
more
or
word
or
sign
or
decoration
or
design
on
a
flag
as
defined
in
the
statute.
now
this
has
for
example
the
dial.
mr.
peter
greenfield
no,
that
--
the
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
the
title
is
improper
use
but
there
is
no
room
for
interpretation
that
a
court
could
pick
up
on
a
word
such
as
improper.
now
the
argument
that
the
state
makes
is
that
because
there
is
no
distinction
made
between
what
we
would
--
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
perhaps
think
of
improper
use,
disrespectful
use
or
some
other
that
the
statute
is
therefore
neutral
and
poses
no
threat
to
first
amendment
activity
but
this
kind
of
neutrality
is
nonetheless,
if
it
is
in
fact
neutrality,
a
neutrality
which
poses
a
burden
on
first
amendment
rights.
if
we
cut
out
the
tongues
of
all
adult
citizens,
this
may
be
neutral
relative
to
their
political
persuasion
but
nonetheless
it
inhibits
their
ability
to
engage
in
first
amendment
protected
activity.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
that
if
a
statute
were
to
--
for
example,
prohibit
criticism
of
one
of
these
works,
that
there
would
clearly
be
first
amendment
implications.
if
i
owned
a
copy
of
a
book
that
was
copyrighted
and
i
made
some
marks
in
the
margin
and
that
were
critical
and
that
were
viewed
as
prohibited
by
the
copyright
laws,
i
think
that
would
pull
serious
first
amendment
problems.
of
course,
the
purpose
of
copyright
protection
is
extremely
different
than
the
purposes
that
both
the
supreme
court
and
the
state
tenders
its
justification
for
this
kind
of
statute.
mr.
peter
greenfield
it’s
interesting
that
the
state
doesn’t
make
the
argument
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
promote
respect
for
the
flag.
the
state
concedes,
i
think
that
it’s
at
page
12
of
their
brief
that
as
--
if
the
statute
were
designed
to
promote
and
respect
for
the
flag,
to
require
citizens
to
give
this
evidence
for
their
respect
for
what
the
flag
symbolizes
that
that
would
be
directly
contrary
to
the
holdings
in
this
court
in
such
cases
as
street
versus
new
york
and
i
don’t
know
whether
they
cite
it
but
it
additionally,
west
virginia
versus
barnette.
the
state
argues
and
i
think
that
the
sole
argument
which
they
make
here
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
flag
is
to
present
breaches
of
the
peace.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
if
the
flag
can
be
treated
that
way,
that
is,
it
can
be
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
that
burning
the
flag
poses
a
substantial
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
but
i
think
that
either
of
those
cases,
the
cutting
it
up
i
think
is
closer
to
this
case.
i
think
--
let
me
take
them
one
at
a
time,
cutting
it
up
is
actually
what
was
done
in
--
well,
what
was
done
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
when
he
campaigned
by
use
of
a
button
with
his
image
superimposed.
that
is,
that
the
--
there
wasn’t
a
tearing
but
the
statute
reaches
metal
as
well
as
other
kinds
of
flags.
what
interests
us
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
your
honor,
what
chief
judge
lombard
argued
and
i
think
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
the
short
answer,
in
my
opinion
would
be
no,
that
is,
i
think
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
we
have
to
consider
what
interest
the
state
might
have
in
preventing
a
cutting
of
the
flag.
now,
if
we
find
and
there's
no
dispute
on
this
record
that
the
appellant
was
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
convey
a
political
message
and
assuming
that
that’s
the
kind
of
situation
that
we
have
which
i
think
is
the
simplest
case
but
not
like
--
not,
i
would
say
the
only
case
in
which
the
activity
is
protected.
then
we
have
to
determine
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
preventing
a
physical
alteration
or
tearing
of
the
flag.
mr.
peter
greenfield
your
honor
i
say
that
i
don’t
know
what
the
state’s
interest
might
be.
now,
if
the
interest
is
that
which
the
state
here
urges,
that
is
to
prevent
breaches
of
the
peace
then
i
think
it’s
simply
implausible.
that
is
the
average
violation
of
one
of
these
statutes
and
they
are
pervasive
in
our
society.
it
simply
doesn’t
spur
the
average
citizen
to
violent
retaliation
and
i
think
that
that’s
really
the
position
that
the
state
has
pushed
to
in
order
to
defend
the
position
that
its
taken
here.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
let
me
say
firstly
that
what
we’re
dealing
here
is
basically
an
analogy
or
an
attempt
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
the
chaplinsky
case.
now,
there
are
--
it
was
always
thought
and
i
assumed
that
its
still
the
case
that
the
state
has
the
burden
to
show
that
the
conduct
which
it
seeks
to
punish
poses
an
eminent
threat
to
the
peace.
in
chaplinsky
or
in
feiner
versus
new
york
for
example,
this
court
found
that
over
some
dissents
that
the
group
which
the
defendant
was
addressing
was
ready
to
fight.
feiner
was
warned
i
believe
on
three
occasions
to
desist
from
the
activity
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
he
refused
to
do
so
and
sub
--consequently
he
was
arrested.
in
this
case,
as
far
as
the
record
discloses,
nobody
except
the
police
saw
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
that’s
the
position
i
think
that
one
has
lead
to
if
one
assumes
as
the
state
argues
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
preserve
the
peace.
that
is
here
--
what
happened,
my
client
flew
his
flag
from
his
window.
the
police
came
in
and
adverted
to
it
and
mr.
spence
said
that
he
had
no
idea
there
was
anything
wrong
with
this.
he
would
be
happy
to
take
it
down,
contrast
that
to
mr.
feiner
who
refused
after
being
asked
by
the
police
to
desist
from
a
speech.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
mr.
spence
was
summarily
arrested
and
taken
off
to
jail.
the
appellant
has
cited
in
its
brief
most
of
if
not
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
heard
that
have
involved
various
uses
of
the
flag,
in
none
of
them
has
--
there’d
been
even
a
suggestion
that
some
kind
of
violent
reaction
by
any
of
the
observers
was
likely
to
follow
and
i
know
of
no
such
incident
and
the
state
has
made
no
attempt
to
cite
it,
surely
here,
where
only
three
policemen
observed
the
appellant's
conduct,
it
stretches
the
imagination
to
ask
this
court,
i
think
to
conclude
that
there
was
an
eminent
threat
of
violence.
but
i
would
repeat
that
i
think
it's
presumptuous
of
the
state
to
ask
this
court
to
judicially
notice
that
the
average
citizen
of
the
state
of
washington
when
confronted
with
a
flag
with,
for
example,
i
love
america,
superimposed
on
it
is
going
to
be
moved
to
violent
reaction
and
i
don’t
think
i
can
emphasize
too
much
the
breadth
of
the
statute.
the
flag
which
is
displayed
in
this
courtroom
is
in
blatant
violation
of
the
washington
statute
that’s
under
review
here.
it
has
attached
to
it
a
yellow
a
fringe
and
there's
nothing
in
title
iv
in
the
description
of
the
flag
that
makes
the
flag
red,
white,
blue
and
yellow.
that
fringe
is
attached
in
the
same
sense
as
mr.
spence’s
peace
symbol
was
attached
to
the
flag.
and
yet
he
was
prosecuted
and
i
assume
that
no
prosecution
will
arise
out
of
this
instance.
mr.
peter
greenfield
no,
but
this
--
the
district
has
a
comparable
statute
under
which,
i’m
sorry
to
advice
the
court,
this
will
--
i
would
think
is
a
blatant
violation
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i’m
sorry
i
couldn’t
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
find
it
difficult
in
a
way
to
see
how
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
--
this
court
could
rewrite
the
statute
and
read
into
it
a
--
for
example
the
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
it
says
that
one
cannot
attach
a
design.
now
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
let
me
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
one
of
the
problems
with
this
kind
of
statute
is
of
course,
it's
always
difficult
to
say.
mr.
peter
greenfield
no,
the
record
indicates
that
mr.
spence
used
a
form
of
tape
so
that
there
would
be
no
harm
done
to
the
flag.
there's
nothing
again,
the
state
does
not
contend
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
the
average
viewer
would
have
known
it
and
the
reason
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
would've
known
what
he
was
trying
to
communicate.
mr.
peter
greenfield
which
was
a
protest
to
the
then
immediately
proceeding
events,
the
invasion
of
cambodia
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
let
me
give
the
court
an
example.
somebody
is
standing
on
a
street
corner
with
a
big
sign
that
says
stop,
or
peace
now.
this
is
a
fairly
ambiguous
sign
as
is
most
language
unless
you
put
it
into
some
specific
context
but
the
court
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
today?
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
that
it
would
depend
in
large
measure
on
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
on
where
it
was
displayed
by
whom
and
before
whom.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
it
might
well
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i
would
certainly
concede
that
it
would
be
ambiguous.
however,
in
this
situation,
i
don’t
think
that
it
was
all
--
at
all
ambiguous
and
i
refer
the
court
to
the
state’s
brief
at
page
2
and
3
where
it
fills
in
the
background
which
i
think
gave
very
clear
meaning
to
mr.
spence’s
words.
that
is
--
or
to
his
expression.
the
united
states
had
just
invaded
cambodia
and
i
think
that
as
the
state
observes,
millions
of
americans
have
this
on
their
mind,
also
the
tragedy
at
kent
state
university
had
just
occurred.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
the
police
officers
who
arrested
mr.
spence
identified
it
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i’m
sure
that
that’s
the
case
mr.
justice
marshall
just
as
i
am
sure
that
in
any
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
not
to
certain
people
but
i
think
that
if
we
impose
too
heavy
a
burden
of
clarity
on
people
who
are
attempting
to
convey
first
amendment
messages
then
perhaps
the
average
citizen
is
going
to
have
to
remain
silent.
the
record
also
clarifies
to
a
substantial
extent
than
i
think
the
state
concedes
of
what
the
message
that
my
client
was
attempting
to
convey
was
--
this
case
of
course
comes
here
on
a
stipulated
set
of
facts
and
the
message
is
--
i
think
part
of
the
stipulation.
the
state
paraphrases
the
testimony
of
mr.
spence
which
i
think
again
if
it
doesn’t
convey
something
so
clear
that
it
could
be
reduced
to
a
mathematical
formula.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
if
somebody
is
parading
in
front
of
the
state
department
with
the
sign
that
says
peace
now.
it's
not
possible,
i
don’t
think
to
infer
from
that
sign
just
what
their
program
for
peace
might
be.
mr.
peter
greenfield
it
might.
but
i
wonder
whether
on
that
ground
this
court
would
want
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
message
is
not
protected
that
if
one
can’t
pinpoint
a
precise
political
program
that
therefore,
one
is
foreclosed
from
speaking
and
i
think
under
the
circumstances
this
was
relatively
clear
political
message.
it
showed,
i
think
in
opposition
to
the
policies
of
the
administration
at
that
time
and
i
think
the
average
citizen
would
have
taken
it
to
advert
both
to
the
cambodia
incident
and
to
that,
the
kent
state
university.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct
your
honor
and
here
i
think
that
the
argument
which
appellant
makes
is
precisely
that
which
judge
lombard
made
in
long
island
moratorium
committee
versus
cahn.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct.
the
state
characterizes
that.
i
think
inaccurately
as
applying
only
to
the
specific
symbol
which
appeared
as
an
appendix
to
that
opinion
but
the
language
of
chief
judge
lombard’s
opinion,
i
think
is
absolutely
clear.
he
was
disqualifying
the
statute
on
its
face.
this
is
the
kind
of
statute
that
led
the
--
that
led
judge
creighton
of
the
fourth
circuit,
in
parker
versus
morgan
to
observe
that
for
people
in
north
carolina
with
such
a
statute
on
the
books,
it
was
dangerous
to
posses
any
object
that
was
red,
white
and
blue.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i
didn’t
mr.
justice
powell
and
i
would
say
that
under
this
particular
statute,
the
flag
burning
would
not
be
a
violation.
now,
i
think
a
state
could
properly
design
a
statute
which
would
prohibit
burning
of
anything
on
the
street
for
safety
reasons
and
which
could
reach
a
flag.
i
think
just
as
the
copyright
example
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
gave
us.
we’re
not
saying
that
the
state
has
its
hands
tied
whenever
anyone
attempts
to
communicate
a
message.
however,
if
the
the
statute
only
applied
to
american
flags
rather
than
to,
for
example,
canadian
flags
that
were
burned
on
the
street.
then
the
object
of
the
statute
would
be
to
get
at
the
message
and
not
to
protect
the
safety
of
passersby
from
burning
objects
and
i
think
that
runs
squarely
counter
to
the
theory
expressed
by
this
court
in
west
virginia
versus
barnette.
it
elevates
the
flag
to
the
level
of
an
item.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct.
mr.
peter
greenfield
it's
both,
i
hope
that
i
may
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
but
let
me
in
response
to
your
question
say
that
--
the
statute
is
overbroad
because
all
of
these
examples
beginning
with
the
flag
in
this
courtroom
in
this
--
the
buttons
which
chief
justice
lombard
--
chief
judge
lombard
referred
to
in
cahn
would
be
prohibited
and
it
was
inconceivable
to
that
court
and
i
think
that
it
will
be
inconceivable
to
this
court
that
that
kind
of
traditional
express
of
conduct
could
be
a
violation
of
any
properly
drawn
statute.
if
the
purpose
is
to
prevent
--
to
promote
respect
for
the
flag,
then
the
statute
is
overbroad
if
it
prevents
a
citizen
from
saying,
“i
love
the
flag,”
or
as
one
of
the
exhibits
in
this
court,
in
this
case,
exemplified
prints
in
a
newspaper,
the
declaration
of
independence
superimposed
on
the
flag
on
the
occasion
of
independent
state.
this
is
a
plain
violation
of
the
statute
and
its
for
that
reason
overbroad,
the
vagueness
argument
basically
takes
off
from
the
proposition
that
most
of
the
courts
who
would
view
these
kinds
of
statutes
has
said
they
can’t
be
taken
literally
because
if
they
do,
they
have
all
these
absurd
consequences
and
consequently,
one
has
to
guess
as
to
whether
this
flag
constitutes
a
violation.
and
mr.
spence’s
flag
doesn’t
and
if
one
has
to
guess,
the
statute
is
vague.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
greenfield
let
me
just
clarify
that
personal
in
the
sense
that
mr.
warme
was
using
it
slightly
different,
i
think
and
personal
in
the
sense
in
which
it
was
used
in
chaplinsky,
that
is,
was
the
fighting
words
doctrine
involves
words
directed
at
a
person,
not
something
that
one
may
as
a
matter
of
his
own
feelings
finds
the
troubling.
and
let
me
say
in
response
to
justice
powell’s
questions,
there
are
two
examples
of
selected
enforcement,
and
the
record
in
this,
exhibits
1
and
2,
one
of
which
is
an
american
flag
and
a
picture
with
the
declaration
of
independence
superimposed.
there
have
been
many
such
examples
in
the
state
of
washington
and
none
of
them
have
resulted
in
prosecution.
the
supreme
court
did
not
narrow,
that
is
the
washington
supreme
court
did
not
narrow
the
statute
in
its
decision
here.
it
simply
refused
to
consider
what
it
regarded
as
hypothetical
examples
of
rejecting
what
appellant
had
asked
that
it
invoked
mainly
the
first
amendment
overbreadth
argument
that
would
allow
other
instances
to
be
considered
in
the
statute
as
overbroad
as
this
one.
i
think
also
the
observation
of
mr.
justice
white
that
actually
there's
no
difference
between
characterizing
the
washington
court
position
as
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
flag
and
the
respect
for
the
flag
argument.
there
isn’t
any
distinction
there.
the
reason
that
one
that
purports
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
flag
is
to
promote
its
respect
otherwise
we’re
feeling
a
totally
circular
argument
and
if
i
can
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
right,
unless
you
deal
with
property
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
(voice
overlap)
which
clearly
is
not
the
case
here.
if
this
were
someone
else’s
flag,
we
wouldn’t
being
here
--
be
here
making
the
argument.
if
i
can
take
one
more
example
and
i
know
i
have
very
little
time,
the
respect
for
the
flag
argument,
i
think
it
was
aptly
rejected
in
an
analogous
case
by
thomas
jefferson,
it
was
quoted
in
the
opinion
of
this
court,
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
he
was
making
a
statement
which
related
to
the
sedition
act
and
he
referred
to
that
defunct
act
and
said
that
it
was
a
nullity
as
palpable
as
if
congress
had
directed
us
to
fall
down
on
our
knees
and
worship
a
golden
image.
and
i
think
these
flag
statutes
which
are
recently
enacted
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
right
and
none
of
them
arose
before
the
end
of
the
19th
century.
they're
recent
statutes
and
i
think
that
the
threaten
to
make
the
american
flag
just
the
kind
of
golden
image
which
would
have
horrified
thomas
jefferson
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i
don’t
--
there
are
no
other
reported
opinions
your
honor
and
there
have
been
other
flag
prosecutions
none
of
which
have
reached
so
far
as
i
know
the
constitutional
issue
is
involved
but
i
think
that
they
were
under
the
desecration
statute.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct
and
since
it
was
upheld,
people
in
washington
will
not
know
whether
they
dare
wear
a
campaign
button
of
the
kind
that’s
been
exemplified
or
use
any
of
the
other
flag
related
messages
that
are
simply
a
part
of
america.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
precisely
that
that
the
significance
of
feiner
was
that
one
didn’t
simply
look
at
his
words
because
i
think
feiner’s
words
in
a
different
context
would
have
been
protected
beyond
question
but
it
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
crowd
that
was
getting
uneasy
and
that
the
court
found
was
about
to
erupt
into
violence
and
that
feiner
had
been
warned
to
desist
and
that
he
refused
after
three
warnings
to
do
so.
that
was
what
enabled
the
court
to
find
there
was
eminent
threat
of
violence
and
therefore
under
the
fighting
words
doctrine,
feiner
could
be
prohibited
from
continuing
with
the
speech.
but
here
the
state
says
it
can
erect
a
conclusive
presumption
that
if
--
because
of
the
uneducated
people
of
washington
that
anyone
who
sees
a
flag
with
god
bless
america
over
it,
is
likely
to
respond
by
violent
retaliation
and
i
submit
that
that’s
a
simply
implausible.
none
of
the
flag
cases
that
--
in
any
jurisdiction
support
in
effect
a
judicial
notice
by
this
court,
that
the
people
of
this
country
conform
into
that
degree
to
the
description
of
harms.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
peter
greenfield
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
to
give
some
perspective
to
the
question
before
the
court
this
morning,
i
will
relate
a
piece
of
history
that
i
learned
just
in
the
last
week
involving
president
lincoln’s
favorite
clown,
it
was
discussed
in
an
article
that
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
magazine
of
december
30th.
the
clown
in
question
was
named
dan
rice
and
he
dressed
himself
up
in
an
outfit
that
was
designed
to
look
like
the
american
flag.
it
was
in
a
reverent
expression.
i
think
in
the
tradition
of
people
like
mr.
goguen
whose
case
was
argued
only
recently
before
this
court.
mr.
rice
called
himself
uncle
sam
and
the
image
which
he
conveyed
has
remained
with
us
in
various
forms
and
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
uncle
sam
has
been
in
cartoons
and
at
the
head
of
parades,
a
violator
repeatedly
of
the
kind
of
statute
which
is
before
the
court
this
morning.
this
case
comes
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
my
client,
harold
spence
was
convicted
for
flying
a
privately
owned
american
flag
with
a
black
cape
peace
symbol,
superimposed
on
it
from
the
window
of
his
apartment
in
seattle,
washington.
mr.
peter
greenfield
mr.
rice
was
the
clown
whose
--
at
least
according
to
the
new
york
times
was
president
lincoln’s
favorite.
mr.
peter
greenfield
he’s
not
a
party
to
this
action
your
honor.[laughter]
i
believe
his
reign
extended
in
the
mid
19th
century.
mr.
peter
greenfield
no,
he
isn’t.
he
was
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i’m
not
sure
whether
that
appears
in
the
record
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
in
fact
was
suspended
upside
down.
that
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
statute
here
at
issue.
as
i
understand
it,
an
upside
down
flag
is
traditionally
a
symbol
of
distress
and
i
think
it
was
consistent
with
the
message
which
mr.
spence
was
attempting
to
convey.
however
he
was
not
convicted
as
a
result
of
the
position
of
the
flag
but
merely
because
there
was
something
superimposed
on
the
flag
and
that
something
could
have
been
under
the
broadly
word
at
statute
of
our
state,
words
such
as
i
love
america,
the
content
would
not
have
been
of
consequence.
this
case
doesn’t
have
any
of
the
complicating
features
that
some
recent
political
protest
cases
have,
that
have
been
before
this
court.
it
doesn’t
involve
as
the
tinker
case
did.
the
black
arm
bands
that
were
worn
in
a
school
room,
that
the
location,
that
was
across
of
some
concern
unlike
the
papish
case,
the
political
cartoon
that
was
published
on
college
campus.
it
doesn’t
involve
any
question
of
the
right
of
(inaudible)
campuses
to
state
or
regulate
activity
on
college
campuses.
it
doesn’t
involve
any
trespass
on
private
or
public
property
or
any
destruction
of
property
or
government
records
as
was
the
case
in
united
states
versus
o’brien.
the
only
factor
which
makes
this
case
at
all
complicated
or
indeed
at
all
interest
in
this
that
it
involved
an
american
flag.
and
as
to
whether
or
not
that
makes
the
case
difficult.
i
would
remind
the
court
of
the
observation
of
mt.
justice
jackson
in
west
virginia
versus
barnette,
that
is
that
the
underlying
principles
arising
out
of
the
first
amendment
are
simple
ones
and
it's
only
--
the
only
problem
on
a
case
like
this
is
going
beyond
the
emotional
preconceptions
that
we
have
when
our
flag
is
involved
in
getting
to
those
fundamental
and
basically
simple
principles.
basically,
there
are
two
kinds
of
statutes
that
are
currently
the
subject
of
a
great
deal
of
litigation
throughout
the
country,
criminal
statutes
promulgated
by
the
states
and
referring
to
flags.
they
are
the
desecration
statutes,
the
kind
of
statute
that
were
--
was
at
issue
in
the
goguen
case
which
punishes
behavior
which
reflects
some
kind
of
contempt
or
intentional
desecration
of
the
flag
either
by
words
or
by
some
other
form
of
conduct.
that
kind
of
statute
is
not
at
issue
here
today.
washington
statute
which
--
under
which
mr.
spence
was
prosecuted
deals
with
what
is
referred
to
in
the
title
as
“improper
use
of
the
flag.”
and
i
should
start
by
saying
that
the
flag
is
defined
very
broadly
in
the
statute.
a
flag,
i
believe
the
definition
says
flag
etcetera
defined,
refers
to
any
flag,
emblem,
a
shield
or
color
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
washington
or
any
picture
or
representation
of
the
flag
of
any
substance
that
is
of
metal
or
stone.
the
buttons
which
have
flags
on
them
and
have
the
face
of
a
political
candidate
are
equally
punishable
under
washington
statute
as
was
--
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington
the
conduct
engaged
in
by
mr.
spence.
and
once
again
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
right.
the
statute
applies
both
to
the
state
flag
and
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
state
flag
has
been
at
issue.
i
don’t
know
whether
the
average
citizen
of
the
state
washington
could
recognize
or
describe
the
flag
of
the
state
of
washington
if
asked.
mr.
peter
greenfield
pardon?
mr.
peter
greenfield
i
as
--
i
certainly
assume
that
that’s
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
if
the
average
citizen
of
washington
were
asked
whether
the
flag
of
our
state
is
a
green
flag
with
the
face
of
the
first
president
on
it
or
the
picture
of
mount
rainier
or
a
pine
tree
that
the
distribution
of
answers
would
probably
be
approximately
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i’ll
have
to
defer
to
mr.
warne(ph)
for
that
to
answer
your
honor.
i’m
sorry,
i
can’t.
mr.
peter
greenfield
right.
i
don’t
think
there's
any
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
right.
i
don’t
believe
there's
any
question
that
this
was
a
flag
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
depends
on
some
other
things.
mr.
peter
greenfield
which
are
in
fact
much
more
complicated
because
judges
including
judge
lumbard
of
second
circuit
in
long
island
moratorium
committee
versus
cahn,
perhaps
the
most
detailed
explication
of
the
statute
of
this
sort
and
a
case
that’s
pending
before
this
court,
that
is
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
was
filed
several
years
ago,
suggested
that
one
could
not
read
a
statute
of
this
sort
literally
because
the
results
were
too
bizarre
and
consequently
we
get
into
something
which
i
think
is
fair
to
characterize
as
symbolic
speech
as
distinguished
from
literal
speech
in
a
statute
which
presents
very
serious
problems.
the
kinds
of
examples
which
that
chief
judge
lumbard
gave
of
what
seemed
to
him
to
be
obvious
violations
of
the
new
york
statute
which
is
very
similar
to
the
washington
statute
or
such
things
as
the
buttons
which
every
presidential
candidate
in
recent
history
including
several
chief
justices
of
this
court
have
displayed
that
is,
pictures
of
the
american
flag
or
part
of
it
with
their
faces
superimposed,
it
would
go
to
a
--
the
various
magazine
covers
that
have
--
almost
every
magazine
of
national
circulation
in
the
last
few
years
had
one
or
another
with
a
flag
or
part
of
it
and
the
title
of
the
magazine
in
various
stories
superimposed.
many
examples
of
this
kinds
of
seemingly
patent
violations
of
statutes
of
this
sort
occur
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
filed
with
this
court,
the
reply
brief
for
appellant
in
radich
versus
new
york.
that
is
number
169,
october
term,
1970.
i
think
thought
that
we
all
have
some
familiarity
with
these
kinds
of
things.
i
noticed
on
the
plane
flying
east,
united
airlines
distributed
to
me
a
brochure
with
advertising
a
telephone,
i’ll
leave
a
copy
of
this
with
the
clerk
if
anyone
would
like
to
see
it,
a
patent
violation
of
the
statute.
this
--
the
breadth
of
the
statute
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
statute
prohibits
the
placing
of
any
more
or
word
or
sign
or
decoration
or
design
on
a
flag
as
defined
in
the
statute.
now
this
has
for
example
the
dial.
mr.
peter
greenfield
no,
that
--
the
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
the
title
is
improper
use
but
there
is
no
room
for
interpretation
that
a
court
could
pick
up
on
a
word
such
as
improper.
now
the
argument
that
the
state
makes
is
that
because
there
is
no
distinction
made
between
what
we
would
--
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
perhaps
think
of
improper
use,
disrespectful
use
or
some
other
that
the
statute
is
therefore
neutral
and
poses
no
threat
to
first
amendment
activity
but
this
kind
of
neutrality
is
nonetheless,
if
it
is
in
fact
neutrality,
a
neutrality
which
poses
a
burden
on
first
amendment
rights.
if
we
cut
out
the
tongues
of
all
adult
citizens,
this
may
be
neutral
relative
to
their
political
persuasion
but
nonetheless
it
inhibits
their
ability
to
engage
in
first
amendment
protected
activity.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
that
if
a
statute
were
to
--
for
example,
prohibit
criticism
of
one
of
these
works,
that
there
would
clearly
be
first
amendment
implications.
if
i
owned
a
copy
of
a
book
that
was
copyrighted
and
i
made
some
marks
in
the
margin
and
that
were
critical
and
that
were
viewed
as
prohibited
by
the
copyright
laws,
i
think
that
would
pull
serious
first
amendment
problems.
of
course,
the
purpose
of
copyright
protection
is
extremely
different
than
the
purposes
that
both
the
supreme
court
and
the
state
tenders
its
justification
for
this
kind
of
statute.
mr.
peter
greenfield
it’s
interesting
that
the
state
doesn’t
make
the
argument
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
promote
respect
for
the
flag.
the
state
concedes,
i
think
that
it’s
at
page
12
of
their
brief
that
as
--
if
the
statute
were
designed
to
promote
and
respect
for
the
flag,
to
require
citizens
to
give
this
evidence
for
their
respect
for
what
the
flag
symbolizes
that
that
would
be
directly
contrary
to
the
holdings
in
this
court
in
such
cases
as
street
versus
new
york
and
i
don’t
know
whether
they
cite
it
but
it
additionally,
west
virginia
versus
barnette.
the
state
argues
and
i
think
that
the
sole
argument
which
they
make
here
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
flag
is
to
present
breaches
of
the
peace.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
if
the
flag
can
be
treated
that
way,
that
is,
it
can
be
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
that
burning
the
flag
poses
a
substantial
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
but
i
think
that
either
of
those
cases,
the
cutting
it
up
i
think
is
closer
to
this
case.
i
think
--
let
me
take
them
one
at
a
time,
cutting
it
up
is
actually
what
was
done
in
--
well,
what
was
done
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
when
he
campaigned
by
use
of
a
button
with
his
image
superimposed.
that
is,
that
the
--
there
wasn’t
a
tearing
but
the
statute
reaches
metal
as
well
as
other
kinds
of
flags.
what
interests
us
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
your
honor,
what
chief
judge
lombard
argued
and
i
think
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
the
short
answer,
in
my
opinion
would
be
no,
that
is,
i
think
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
we
have
to
consider
what
interest
the
state
might
have
in
preventing
a
cutting
of
the
flag.
now,
if
we
find
and
there's
no
dispute
on
this
record
that
the
appellant
was
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
convey
a
political
message
and
assuming
that
that’s
the
kind
of
situation
that
we
have
which
i
think
is
the
simplest
case
but
not
like
--
not,
i
would
say
the
only
case
in
which
the
activity
is
protected.
then
we
have
to
determine
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
preventing
a
physical
alteration
or
tearing
of
the
flag.
mr.
peter
greenfield
your
honor
i
say
that
i
don’t
know
what
the
state’s
interest
might
be.
now,
if
the
interest
is
that
which
the
state
here
urges,
that
is
to
prevent
breaches
of
the
peace
then
i
think
it’s
simply
implausible.
that
is
the
average
violation
of
one
of
these
statutes
and
they
are
pervasive
in
our
society.
it
simply
doesn’t
spur
the
average
citizen
to
violent
retaliation
and
i
think
that
that’s
really
the
position
that
the
state
has
pushed
to
in
order
to
defend
the
position
that
its
taken
here.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
let
me
say
firstly
that
what
we’re
dealing
here
is
basically
an
analogy
or
an
attempt
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
the
chaplinsky
case.
now,
there
are
--
it
was
always
thought
and
i
assumed
that
its
still
the
case
that
the
state
has
the
burden
to
show
that
the
conduct
which
it
seeks
to
punish
poses
an
eminent
threat
to
the
peace.
in
chaplinsky
or
in
feiner
versus
new
york
for
example,
this
court
found
that
over
some
dissents
that
the
group
which
the
defendant
was
addressing
was
ready
to
fight.
feiner
was
warned
i
believe
on
three
occasions
to
desist
from
the
activity
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
he
refused
to
do
so
and
sub
--consequently
he
was
arrested.
in
this
case,
as
far
as
the
record
discloses,
nobody
except
the
police
saw
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
that’s
the
position
i
think
that
one
has
lead
to
if
one
assumes
as
the
state
argues
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
preserve
the
peace.
that
is
here
--
what
happened,
my
client
flew
his
flag
from
his
window.
the
police
came
in
and
adverted
to
it
and
mr.
spence
said
that
he
had
no
idea
there
was
anything
wrong
with
this.
he
would
be
happy
to
take
it
down,
contrast
that
to
mr.
feiner
who
refused
after
being
asked
by
the
police
to
desist
from
a
speech.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
mr.
spence
was
summarily
arrested
and
taken
off
to
jail.
the
appellant
has
cited
in
its
brief
most
of
if
not
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
heard
that
have
involved
various
uses
of
the
flag,
in
none
of
them
has
--
there’d
been
even
a
suggestion
that
some
kind
of
violent
reaction
by
any
of
the
observers
was
likely
to
follow
and
i
know
of
no
such
incident
and
the
state
has
made
no
attempt
to
cite
it,
surely
here,
where
only
three
policemen
observed
the
appellant's
conduct,
it
stretches
the
imagination
to
ask
this
court,
i
think
to
conclude
that
there
was
an
eminent
threat
of
violence.
but
i
would
repeat
that
i
think
it's
presumptuous
of
the
state
to
ask
this
court
to
judicially
notice
that
the
average
citizen
of
the
state
of
washington
when
confronted
with
a
flag
with,
for
example,
i
love
america,
superimposed
on
it
is
going
to
be
moved
to
violent
reaction
and
i
don’t
think
i
can
emphasize
too
much
the
breadth
of
the
statute.
the
flag
which
is
displayed
in
this
courtroom
is
in
blatant
violation
of
the
washington
statute
that’s
under
review
here.
it
has
attached
to
it
a
yellow
a
fringe
and
there's
nothing
in
title
iv
in
the
description
of
the
flag
that
makes
the
flag
red,
white,
blue
and
yellow.
that
fringe
is
attached
in
the
same
sense
as
mr.
spence’s
peace
symbol
was
attached
to
the
flag.
and
yet
he
was
prosecuted
and
i
assume
that
no
prosecution
will
arise
out
of
this
instance.
mr.
peter
greenfield
no,
but
this
--
the
district
has
a
comparable
statute
under
which,
i’m
sorry
to
advice
the
court,
this
will
--
i
would
think
is
a
blatant
violation
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i’m
sorry
i
couldn’t
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
find
it
difficult
in
a
way
to
see
how
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
--
this
court
could
rewrite
the
statute
and
read
into
it
a
--
for
example
the
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
it
says
that
one
cannot
attach
a
design.
now
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
let
me
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
one
of
the
problems
with
this
kind
of
statute
is
of
course,
it's
always
difficult
to
say.
mr.
peter
greenfield
no,
the
record
indicates
that
mr.
spence
used
a
form
of
tape
so
that
there
would
be
no
harm
done
to
the
flag.
there's
nothing
again,
the
state
does
not
contend
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
the
average
viewer
would
have
known
it
and
the
reason
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
would've
known
what
he
was
trying
to
communicate.
mr.
peter
greenfield
which
was
a
protest
to
the
then
immediately
proceeding
events,
the
invasion
of
cambodia
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
let
me
give
the
court
an
example.
somebody
is
standing
on
a
street
corner
with
a
big
sign
that
says
stop,
or
peace
now.
this
is
a
fairly
ambiguous
sign
as
is
most
language
unless
you
put
it
into
some
specific
context
but
the
court
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
today?
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
that
it
would
depend
in
large
measure
on
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
on
where
it
was
displayed
by
whom
and
before
whom.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
it
might
well
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i
would
certainly
concede
that
it
would
be
ambiguous.
however,
in
this
situation,
i
don’t
think
that
it
was
all
--
at
all
ambiguous
and
i
refer
the
court
to
the
state’s
brief
at
page
2
and
3
where
it
fills
in
the
background
which
i
think
gave
very
clear
meaning
to
mr.
spence’s
words.
that
is
--
or
to
his
expression.
the
united
states
had
just
invaded
cambodia
and
i
think
that
as
the
state
observes,
millions
of
americans
have
this
on
their
mind,
also
the
tragedy
at
kent
state
university
had
just
occurred.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
the
police
officers
who
arrested
mr.
spence
identified
it
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i’m
sure
that
that’s
the
case
mr.
justice
marshall
just
as
i
am
sure
that
in
any
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
not
to
certain
people
but
i
think
that
if
we
impose
too
heavy
a
burden
of
clarity
on
people
who
are
attempting
to
convey
first
amendment
messages
then
perhaps
the
average
citizen
is
going
to
have
to
remain
silent.
the
record
also
clarifies
to
a
substantial
extent
than
i
think
the
state
concedes
of
what
the
message
that
my
client
was
attempting
to
convey
was
--
this
case
of
course
comes
here
on
a
stipulated
set
of
facts
and
the
message
is
--
i
think
part
of
the
stipulation.
the
state
paraphrases
the
testimony
of
mr.
spence
which
i
think
again
if
it
doesn’t
convey
something
so
clear
that
it
could
be
reduced
to
a
mathematical
formula.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
if
somebody
is
parading
in
front
of
the
state
department
with
the
sign
that
says
peace
now.
it's
not
possible,
i
don’t
think
to
infer
from
that
sign
just
what
their
program
for
peace
might
be.
mr.
peter
greenfield
it
might.
but
i
wonder
whether
on
that
ground
this
court
would
want
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
message
is
not
protected
that
if
one
can’t
pinpoint
a
precise
political
program
that
therefore,
one
is
foreclosed
from
speaking
and
i
think
under
the
circumstances
this
was
relatively
clear
political
message.
it
showed,
i
think
in
opposition
to
the
policies
of
the
administration
at
that
time
and
i
think
the
average
citizen
would
have
taken
it
to
advert
both
to
the
cambodia
incident
and
to
that,
the
kent
state
university.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct
your
honor
and
here
i
think
that
the
argument
which
appellant
makes
is
precisely
that
which
judge
lombard
made
in
long
island
moratorium
committee
versus
cahn.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct.
the
state
characterizes
that.
i
think
inaccurately
as
applying
only
to
the
specific
symbol
which
appeared
as
an
appendix
to
that
opinion
but
the
language
of
chief
judge
lombard’s
opinion,
i
think
is
absolutely
clear.
he
was
disqualifying
the
statute
on
its
face.
this
is
the
kind
of
statute
that
led
the
--
that
led
judge
creighton
of
the
fourth
circuit,
in
parker
versus
morgan
to
observe
that
for
people
in
north
carolina
with
such
a
statute
on
the
books,
it
was
dangerous
to
posses
any
object
that
was
red,
white
and
blue.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i
didn’t
mr.
justice
powell
and
i
would
say
that
under
this
particular
statute,
the
flag
burning
would
not
be
a
violation.
now,
i
think
a
state
could
properly
design
a
statute
which
would
prohibit
burning
of
anything
on
the
street
for
safety
reasons
and
which
could
reach
a
flag.
i
think
just
as
the
copyright
example
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
gave
us.
we’re
not
saying
that
the
state
has
its
hands
tied
whenever
anyone
attempts
to
communicate
a
message.
however,
if
the
the
statute
only
applied
to
american
flags
rather
than
to,
for
example,
canadian
flags
that
were
burned
on
the
street.
then
the
object
of
the
statute
would
be
to
get
at
the
message
and
not
to
protect
the
safety
of
passersby
from
burning
objects
and
i
think
that
runs
squarely
counter
to
the
theory
expressed
by
this
court
in
west
virginia
versus
barnette.
it
elevates
the
flag
to
the
level
of
an
item.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct.
mr.
peter
greenfield
it's
both,
i
hope
that
i
may
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
but
let
me
in
response
to
your
question
say
that
--
the
statute
is
overbroad
because
all
of
these
examples
beginning
with
the
flag
in
this
courtroom
in
this
--
the
buttons
which
chief
justice
lombard
--
chief
judge
lombard
referred
to
in
cahn
would
be
prohibited
and
it
was
inconceivable
to
that
court
and
i
think
that
it
will
be
inconceivable
to
this
court
that
that
kind
of
traditional
express
of
conduct
could
be
a
violation
of
any
properly
drawn
statute.
if
the
purpose
is
to
prevent
--
to
promote
respect
for
the
flag,
then
the
statute
is
overbroad
if
it
prevents
a
citizen
from
saying,
“i
love
the
flag,”
or
as
one
of
the
exhibits
in
this
court,
in
this
case,
exemplified
prints
in
a
newspaper,
the
declaration
of
independence
superimposed
on
the
flag
on
the
occasion
of
independent
state.
this
is
a
plain
violation
of
the
statute
and
its
for
that
reason
overbroad,
the
vagueness
argument
basically
takes
off
from
the
proposition
that
most
of
the
courts
who
would
view
these
kinds
of
statutes
has
said
they
can’t
be
taken
literally
because
if
they
do,
they
have
all
these
absurd
consequences
and
consequently,
one
has
to
guess
as
to
whether
this
flag
constitutes
a
violation.
and
mr.
spence’s
flag
doesn’t
and
if
one
has
to
guess,
the
statute
is
vague.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
greenfield
let
me
just
clarify
that
personal
in
the
sense
that
mr.
warme
was
using
it
slightly
different,
i
think
and
personal
in
the
sense
in
which
it
was
used
in
chaplinsky,
that
is,
was
the
fighting
words
doctrine
involves
words
directed
at
a
person,
not
something
that
one
may
as
a
matter
of
his
own
feelings
finds
the
troubling.
and
let
me
say
in
response
to
justice
powell’s
questions,
there
are
two
examples
of
selected
enforcement,
and
the
record
in
this,
exhibits
1
and
2,
one
of
which
is
an
american
flag
and
a
picture
with
the
declaration
of
independence
superimposed.
there
have
been
many
such
examples
in
the
state
of
washington
and
none
of
them
have
resulted
in
prosecution.
the
supreme
court
did
not
narrow,
that
is
the
washington
supreme
court
did
not
narrow
the
statute
in
its
decision
here.
it
simply
refused
to
consider
what
it
regarded
as
hypothetical
examples
of
rejecting
what
appellant
had
asked
that
it
invoked
mainly
the
first
amendment
overbreadth
argument
that
would
allow
other
instances
to
be
considered
in
the
statute
as
overbroad
as
this
one.
i
think
also
the
observation
of
mr.
justice
white
that
actually
there's
no
difference
between
characterizing
the
washington
court
position
as
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
flag
and
the
respect
for
the
flag
argument.
there
isn’t
any
distinction
there.
the
reason
that
one
that
purports
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
flag
is
to
promote
its
respect
otherwise
we’re
feeling
a
totally
circular
argument
and
if
i
can
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
right,
unless
you
deal
with
property
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
(voice
overlap)
which
clearly
is
not
the
case
here.
if
this
were
someone
else’s
flag,
we
wouldn’t
being
here
--
be
here
making
the
argument.
if
i
can
take
one
more
example
and
i
know
i
have
very
little
time,
the
respect
for
the
flag
argument,
i
think
it
was
aptly
rejected
in
an
analogous
case
by
thomas
jefferson,
it
was
quoted
in
the
opinion
of
this
court,
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
he
was
making
a
statement
which
related
to
the
sedition
act
and
he
referred
to
that
defunct
act
and
said
that
it
was
a
nullity
as
palpable
as
if
congress
had
directed
us
to
fall
down
on
our
knees
and
worship
a
golden
image.
and
i
think
these
flag
statutes
which
are
recently
enacted
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
right
and
none
of
them
arose
before
the
end
of
the
19th
century.
they're
recent
statutes
and
i
think
that
the
threaten
to
make
the
american
flag
just
the
kind
of
golden
image
which
would
have
horrified
thomas
jefferson
--
mr.
peter
greenfield
i
don’t
--
there
are
no
other
reported
opinions
your
honor
and
there
have
been
other
flag
prosecutions
none
of
which
have
reached
so
far
as
i
know
the
constitutional
issue
is
involved
but
i
think
that
they
were
under
the
desecration
statute.
mr.
peter
greenfield
correct
and
since
it
was
upheld,
people
in
washington
will
not
know
whether
they
dare
wear
a
campaign
button
of
the
kind
that’s
been
exemplified
or
use
any
of
the
other
flag
related
messages
that
are
simply
a
part
of
america.
mr.
peter
greenfield
well,
i
think
precisely
that
that
the
significance
of
feiner
was
that
one
didn’t
simply
look
at
his
words
because
i
think
feiner’s
words
in
a
different
context
would
have
been
protected
beyond
question
but
it
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
crowd
that
was
getting
uneasy
and
that
the
court
found
was
about
to
erupt
into
violence
and
that
feiner
had
been
warned
to
desist
and
that
he
refused
after
three
warnings
to
do
so.
that
was
what
enabled
the
court
to
find
there
was
eminent
threat
of
violence
and
therefore
under
the
fighting
words
doctrine,
feiner
could
be
prohibited
from
continuing
with
the
speech.
but
here
the
state
says
it
can
erect
a
conclusive
presumption
that
if
--
because
of
the
uneducated
people
of
washington
that
anyone
who
sees
a
flag
with
god
bless
america
over
it,
is
likely
to
respond
by
violent
retaliation
and
i
submit
that
that’s
a
simply
implausible.
none
of
the
flag
cases
that
--
in
any
jurisdiction
support
in
effect
a
judicial
notice
by
this
court,
that
the
people
of
this
country
conform
into
that
degree
to
the
description
of
harms.
thank
you
very
much.
