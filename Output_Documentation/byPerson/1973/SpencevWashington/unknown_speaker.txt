unknown
speaker
before
you
proceed,
i
kind
of
missed,
who
is
mr.
rice?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
he’s
not
a
party
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
i
see.
he’s
not
your
client.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
the
state
flag,
there
is
no
resemblance
to
the
american
flag.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
tell
me
what
it
looks
like?
unknown
speaker
be
that
--
however,
vague
or
perhaps
overbroad,
the
definition
of
flag
maybe
in
a
9.86.010,
in
this
case,
this
was
a
flag
without
question,
there's
no
contrary
view
of
that,
this
wasn’t
an
emblem
or
standard
or
shield
or
--
unknown
speaker
--
copy
or
picture
or
representation,
it
was
a
flag,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
the
preamble,
the
title
--
unknown
speaker
why
don’t
we
--
don’t
you
think
the
--
how
about
burning
the
flag
as
a
protest?
the
argument
would
reach
that,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
or
cutting
it
up?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
us
that
the
--
is
that
the
--
because
the
president
did
this,
this
statute
is
constitutional?
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
how
about
the
question,
how
about
cutting
up
the
flag,
does
that
--
made
the
state
prevent
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
it
isn’t
sufficient
to
override
anybody’s
desire
to
deliver
a
political
message
through
dismembering
the
flag?
unknown
speaker
well,
we’re
not
the
state
of
washington.
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenfield,
i
gather
that
the
--
your
first
question
attacks
the
statute
as
applied.
unknown
speaker
on
it
--
your
second
question
that
attacks
facially.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
facial
attack
--
unknown
speaker
when
you
refer
to
safety,
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
said,
you
are
--
you're
not
thinking
about
possibility
or
breach
of
the
peace
but
--
of
someone
being
burned?
unknown
speaker
may
i
come
back
a
moment
to
the
statements
you’ve
made
that
you
thought
the
statute
was
void
on
its
face,
is
that
because
of
vagueness
or
overbreadth?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
i
don’t
understand
that
answer
--
this
says
the
word
flag,
copy,
picture
or
representation
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
we
have
to
include
it
by
way
of
an
interpretation
here.
unknown
speaker
as
applied?
unknown
speaker
how
about
tinker,
the
armband?
unknown
speaker
but
tinker
i
gathered
treated
the
wearing
of
the
armband
as
if
it
were
spoken
word.
unknown
speaker
and
isn’t
that
the
problem
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
isn’t
it
arguably
--
?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
suggest
that
the
--
you
don’t
suggest
that
goes
too
far,
say
the
state
may
not
prevent
someone
from
showing
disrespect
by
burning
the
flag?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
care
what
comes
under
it,
do
you
suggest
the
state
may
not
be
there?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
think
if
you
are
going
to
give
away
--
give
that
away,
you’ll
get
this
statute,
a
fortiori.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
would.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you're
suggesting
that
the
state
has
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
not
taken
--
unknown
speaker
--
that
petition
here.
unknown
speaker
maybe
they
felt
something
was
wrong
with
your
ground.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
returned
the
compliment,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
where
were
you
viewing
their
judgment,
not
yours?
unknown
speaker
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
state
supreme
court.
there
were
judgment
but
not
necessarily
its
opinion.
unknown
speaker
i’m
sorry,
the
second
has
escaped
me,
what
was
the
second?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
mean,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
no,
no,
those
are
property
rights,
those
are
statutory
property
rights
that
are
protected
by
the
copyright
law
and
that’s
for
the
appropriation
of
somebody
else’s
property.
now
the
state
has
no
property
right
in
the
flag,
does
it,
vis-à-vis
any
individual
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
the
state?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
defend
--
you're
not
defending
what
the
--
unknown
speaker
now,
that
can
be
your
third,
--
unknown
speaker
well,
now
what
do
you
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
then
you
have
to
read
that
into
your
statute.
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
speaks
of
--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
we
decide
that
when
the
washington
court
decided
it
to
something
else
than
you
are
urging
here?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
real
question
that
no
one
has
asked
you
is
why
do
you
not
at
least
partially
advance
the
thesis
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
washington
supreme
court
has
not
said
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
they
say
that,
really?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
this
statute
has
been
uniformly
applied,
suppose,
for
example,
somebody
mentioned
--
quite
had
been
placed
on
the
flag
or
something
like,
say,
god
save
america.
have
you
ever
brought
a
prosecution
or
had
any
occasion
to
consider
bringing
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
the
only
prosecution
that’s
ever
been
brought?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
god
save
america
on
the
flag
is
much
a
protest
as
the
speech
--
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
breach
of
the
peace
argument?
unknown
speaker
how
much
disorder
would
god
save
america
on
the
flag
provoke?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
if
not
be
god
save
america
from
somebody.
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
has
the
attorney
general
of
your
state
taken
a
position
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
who
does,
just
the
local
prosecutor?
unknown
speaker
suppose
just
the
congress,
it
hadn't
put
this
peace
symbol
on
the
flag
but
it
simply
put
the
peace
symbol
on
his
window.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
would
that
not
have
provoked
as
much
disorder
as
putting
it
on
the
flag?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time?
in
that
time
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
first
amendment
in
any
event
whether
or
not
it
provoked
disorder
would've
protected
the
display
merely
of
the
peace
symbol
not
of
the
peace
symbol
on
the
flag?
if
he
just
put
the
peace
symbol
on
his
window.
unknown
speaker
first
amendment
would
not
protect
it?
unknown
speaker
this
will
be
only
if
in
fact
there
were
disorders,
you
suggest.
unknown
speaker
if
there
were
none,
the
mere
fact
that
he
displayed
it,
he
could
be
protect
--
it
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
your
feeling
of
his
property
--
unknown
speaker
--
and
it
would
be
a
property,
in
other
words
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
did
you
refer
mr.
greenfield,
(inaudible)
the
one
and
only
prosecution
over
this
statute
in
the
history
of
your
state?
unknown
speaker
so
far
as
you
know
under
this
statute,
this
is
the
one
and
only
first
and
last
prosecution
since
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1919.
unknown
