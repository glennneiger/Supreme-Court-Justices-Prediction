mr.
greenfield.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
get
support
for
the
conclusion
that
that
conduct
doesn’t
disturb
the
average
citizen
to
violent
reaction
where
--
that’s
your
argument
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
every
statute
of
this
kind
must
have
as
its
predicate
that
it’s
a
--
the
statement
show
that
the
--
it
has
the
fighting
words
implication
of
the
chaplinsky
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
warme.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
correctly
read
the
record
that
the
essence
of
his
defense
was
that
he
wasn’t
showing
contempt
or
disrespect
but
he
was
showing
respect
for
the
flag
by
associating
it
with
the
concept
of
peace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
his
testimony
essentially
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
protect
a
protect
the
person,
would
it
not
who
has
an
old
worn-out
tattered
flag
and
follows
the
procedure
recommended
in
some
congressionally
published
flag
book
that
the
thing
to
do
with
such
a
flag
is
not
to
throw
out
in
the
garbage
pail
but
to
cremate
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
he
would
be
protected
because
his
purpose
was
a
benign
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
--
excuse
me,
in
history
books
there's
a
--
some
of
the
history
books
has
a
picture
of
the
kind
your
friend
referred
to
of,
i
think
the
campaign
perhaps
of
grover
cleveland
or
the
mckinley’s
day,
that
one
of
the
campaign
documents
was
the
american
flag
with
the
picture
of
the
candidate,
grover
cleveland,
superimposed
over
it.
now,
if
that
were
done
today,
that
would
violate
the
washington
statute,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
flag
itself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
if
it
were
reproduced
as
it
is
in
the
history
book,
it
would
not
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
set
the
picture
of
the
flag
not
a
flag.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
of
the
appendix
is
that
on
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
47,
yes,
47.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
you
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
not
giving
away
your
defilement
statute
that
you
referred
to
before
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
automatically.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
its
clear
that
you
concede
that
putting
the
words
“god
bless
america”
over
the
flag
would
be
as
much
a
violation
of
the
statute
as
the
present
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
friend
says
that
the
reason
this
--
one
of
the
reasons
the
statute
is
overbroad
is
because
it
would
prohibit
both
of
these
expressions
equally,
the
favorable
and
the
ambiguous
one.
that’s
the
core,
a
part
of
this
argument,
an
over
breadth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
greenfield,

you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentlemen.

case
is
