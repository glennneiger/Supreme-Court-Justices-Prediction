justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
any
rate,
they
probably
don’t
own
one,
the
average
citizen.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
copyright
statute
which
that
the
federal
government
prohibits
the
use
of
copyrighted
works,
now
that
certainly
impairs
some
people's
first
amendment
activities,
doesn’t
it?
supposing
your
client
had
wanted
to
get
up
and
perform
one
of
george
m.
cohan’s
flag
songs
and
it
was
copyrighted
and
couldn’t
--
the
statute
would
say,
i
take
it,
he
couldn’t
make
a
public
performance
of
that.
now
do
you
think
there
are
first
amendment
implications
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
gather
the
state
is
saying
that
we
want
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
flag,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
we
don’t
want
people
changing
it
in
effect.
and
so
certainly,
if
your
client
would
have
a
legitimate
claim,
i
would
think
under
your
argument
to
say,
i
thought
it
were
particularly
apt
for
my
kind
of
protest
to
perform
a
george
m.
cohan
song
to
a
meeting
and
yet
the
copyright
law
prohibited
me
from
doing
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
they
say
we’re
not
insisting
on
any
sort
of
affirmative
respect
at
all,
that
so
west
virginia
versus
barnette
is
out
there,
all
we’re
saying
is
that
you
shan’t
tamper
with
the
physical
integrity
of
a
flag.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
abandoning
it
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
not
really
talking
about
statutory
interpretation,
are
you
talking
about
the
basis
on
which
the
statute
has
written
might
be
constitutionally
sustained.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
you
don’t
need
to
say
that
the
legislature,
you
know,
the
legislative
history
shows
this
or
the
supreme
court
interpreted
it
to
mean,
this
if
in
effect
you
can
sell
five
justices
in
this
court
on
the
idea.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
since
mr.
greenfield
relied
on
historical
examples,
you
might
offer
barbara
fritchie
to
support
the
possibility
of
public
outrage
at
the
waiving
of
a
flag
from
the
window.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i’m
wondering
if
your
grounds
for
upholding
the
statute
are
as
different
from
most
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
as
you
intimated
at
one
time.
basically
your
argument
is
that
people
may
become
aroused
by
insults
to
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
unless
--
isn’t
it
and
that
the
state
may
use
that
as
a
basis
for
legislating.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
least
there
are
some
overlap,
i
would
think
between
the
argument
you're
making
and
the
one
used
by
the
supreme
court
or
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenfield,
you
say
in
chaplinsky
and
of
rightly
that
there
--
the
it
was
personally
directed
to
an
individual.
on
the
other
hand,
and
feiner
as
i
recall,
feiner
had
referred
to
president
truman
as
a
champagne
sipping
bomb
are
words
that
affect
to
an
audience
and
the
suppression
there
was
not
based
on
remarks,
addressed
to
the
individuals
but
the
reaction
of
the
individuals,
to
remarks
about
a
third
person.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
