mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
occurred
with
counsel
for
the
appellant
i
must
assume
that
it
was
quite
unusual
for
the
appellee
to
submit
some
information
to
this
court
in
opposition
to
his
suggestion
for
mootness.
at
the
time,
it
was
my
opinion
that
this
case
before
this
honorable
court
was
not
moot,
because
of
reece
versus
geis.
however,
upon
further
research
it
is
my
conclusion
now
that
this
case
is
moot
based
upon
reece
versus
geis,
and
therefore,
this
court
need
not
concern
itself
with
the
issues
now
presented
before
this
court.
if
the
court
pleases,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no,
your
honor,
i
haven’t.
i
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
my
original
--
i
was
requested
to
respond
to
suggestion
of
mootness
on
behalf
of
a
counsel
for
the
appellant,
so
i
would
assume
now
that
the
motion
is
before
the
court
that
i
could
change
my
position
and
argue
that
yes,
it
is
moot.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
normal
procedure
is
that
the
appellee
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no,
your
honor,
within
the
last
quite
frankly
though,
within
the
last
several
weeks.
first,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
this
case
is
moot,
and
i
would
like
to
refer
back
to
reece
versus
geis,
and
that
the
case
before
this
court
now
originated
in
1969
and
reece
versus
geis
started
i
believe
in
1972,
or
possibly
1973,
and
was
decided
in
june
1973.
in
that
case,
we
had
basically
the
same
issues.
we
had
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
had
a
statutory
fee
due
him,
which
was
$2.50
on
each
case
or
each
judgment
that
he
executed
on.
the
court
in
justice
--
in
reece
versus
geis
ruled
that
because
of
this
$2.50
fee,
it
was
a
pecuniary
interest
that
the
jp
possessed,
and
therefore
the
jp
was
disqualified
from
giving
a
judgment
on
the
case
and
as
a
result
that
judgment
that
he
did
give
because
of
this
pecuniary
interest
was
void.
now,
we
contend
now
that
reece
versus
geis
does
apply
to
the
instant
case,
and
therefore,
warner
--
justice
warner
in
this
case,
his
judgment
as
to
patterson
is
likewise
void.
now,
we
get
in
to
the
question
of
retroactivity.
does
reece
in
that
patterson
started
before
reece,
does
reece
versus
geis
apply
now
to
patterson
versus
warner?
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
i’m
not
--
quite
frankly,
i’m
not
sure
what
this
court
can
do
--
as
to
decide
whether
it
is
moot
or
rather
remand
it
to
the
district
court.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
if
you
let
me
continue
justice
brennan,
justice
cardozo
in
answer
to
whether
state
decisions
are
retroactive
or
not,
said
and
that
a
state
may
make
a
choice
for
itself
between
the
principle
of
forward
operation
and
the
relation
backwards.
and
i
would
like
to
submit
that
that
the
west
virginia
law
is
that,
and
i
cite
the
case
of
falconer
versus
simmons,
it’s
not
in
the
brief.
51
west
virginia
172
41
s.e.
193,
it’s
a
1902
case
which
says
that
“it
makes
every
decision
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
retroactive,
except
for
one
particular
exception.”
and
of
course
this
case
does
not
fall
within
that
exception.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
so
therefore
--
so
what
i’m
saying
is
that
reece
versus
geis
does
apply
to
patterson.
therefore,
the
judgment
of
patterson
or
warner
against
patterson
is
likewise
void,
and
therefore,
this
court
should
not
concern
itself
with
the
question
of
whether
--
in
fact
there
was
a
proper
hearing
below
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
courts,
or
whether
the
appeal
bond
is
constitutional
or
not.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
as
well
as
i
can
interpret
that
case,
your
honor,
yes.
that’s
the
way
i
interpret
it.
if
not
that,
at
least
this
court,
we
could
assume
that
there’s
limited
retroactivity
and
that
the
west
virginia
court
surely
follows
the
common
law
or
the
rules
as
were
reflected
and
set
out
in
united
states
versus
schooner
peggy
and
link
letter
versus
walker.
we
contend
that
this
case
is
now
moot,
and
this
court
should
not
have
to
consider
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
whether
due
process
was
afforded
to
mr.
patterson
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
court
and
whether
the
appeal
bond
is
constitutional.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
i
don’t
understand
justice
douglas,
what
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
now
that’s
my
next
argument
in
support
of
mootness.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
you
use
the
reasoning
behind
the
abstention
doctrine.
this
isn’t
an
abstention
doctrine
as
such,
because
we’re
not
asking
this
court
to
abstain
and
let
the
state
court
rule
because
in
fact
the
state
court
has
already
ruled
and
under
the
abstention
doctrine,
this
court
even
though
it
has
jurisdiction
of
cases
under
federal
constitution
and
federal
statute,
you
will
not
--
you
will
avoid
making
a
federal
constitutional
decision
on
a
federal
question
when
you
can
leave
it
to
the
state
to
determine.
and
in
this
case,
the
state
of
west
virginia
has
determined.
so
for
the
reasoning,
under
the
abstention
doctrine,
even
though
this
isn’t
an
abstention
doctrine
and
that
we
are
not
asking
you
to
abstain,
until
the
court
has
ruled.
what
i’m
saying
is,
our
court
has
already
ruled.
there’s
no
reason
for
this
court
to
rule.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
exactly
what
i’m
saying.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that’s
right
your
honor.
that’s
correct.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
also
that
this
would
be
similarly
what
happened
in
the
texas
railroad
commission
versus
pullman.
and
that
here,
we
have
mr.
patterson
who
has
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
judgment
of
justice
warner,
saying
that
the
judgment
denies
him
rights
under
the
federal
law
and
state
law,
and
that
therefore,
the
justice
lacks
jurisdiction
to
make
any
judgment
in
the
case.
and
i
would
assume
that
this
case
is
very
similar
to
that,
and
again
reiterate
that
leaves
nothing
for
this
court
to
decide
as
regards
to
what
i’m
speaking
of
only
to
the
questions
of
due
process,
whether
due
process
was
afforded
mr.
patterson
in
the
justice
court
or
whether
the
appeal
bond
is
constitutional
or
not.
now
to
his
argument
as
to
whether
--
i
think
the
court
may
be
a
little
confused
now
as
to
what
appellant
is
trying
to
argue.
he
is
saying
this
i
think
basically,
i’ll
try
to
simplify
some.
he’s
saying
that
patterson
was
denied
a
fair
hearing
in
the
justice
court
because
warner
had
a
pecuniary
interest,
and
therefore,
he
didn’t
have
a
fair
hearing,
so
it’s
no
hearing
at
all.
so
as
a
result,
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
an
appeal,
and
we
contend
and
say
that
--
we
contend
that
there
is
no
absolute
right
to
appeal
and
we
cite
ortwein
versus
schwab
and
that
ortwein
versus
schwab,
this
court
determined
that
one
did
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
from
administrative
hearing
for
judicial
review.
and
we
say
likewise,
one
does
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
from
justice
court
for
judicial
review.
and
we
could
assume
that
the
appeal
bond
that
one
pays
to
appeal
from
a
justice
court
is
very
comparable
to
the
fee
of
$25.00
that
one
had
to
pay
to
appeal
from
the
administrative
hearing
in
ortwein
to
a
court
there.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
pardon?
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
as
far
as
being
a
fee.
what
i’m
saying
is
there’s
not
an
absolute
right
to
an
appeal.
that’s
what
i’m
saying.
as
in
ortwein,
you
don’t
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
from
a
jp
court
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
i’m
directing
my
argument
to
this
due
process
argument
now,
not
to
as
equal
protection
argument.
now
if
this
court
should
determine
that
the
jp
did
in
fact
have
a
pecuniary
interest,
and
therefore,
he
should’ve
disqualified
himself
and
that
he
didn’t
--
his
judgment
is
void.
and
should
you
further
question
whether
the
appeal
bond
acts
as
a
bar
to
access
to
a
court
of
record
then
i
cite
the
kras
case
for
the
proposition
and
rule
that
one
does
not
have
an
absolute
rule
to
initial
judicial
determination
of
one’s
claim.
and
again,
i
would
compare
the
appeal
bond
to
that
of
the
$50.00
filing
fee
that
one
had
to
pay
in
kras.
another
argument
that
the
appellant
uses
is
that
well,
here
we
have
mr.
patterson
who
is
forced
into
a
jp
court
and
supposedly
had
a
hearing,
but
yet
it
wasn’t
a
fair
hearing,
so
it's
no
hearing,
but
to
appeal,
you’re
making
the
man
pay
a
double
bond.
well,
if
the
court
is
to
believe
that
argument,
then
as
has
been
mentioned
earlier,
any
amount,
any
fee
of
any
amount
would
stand
in
the
way
not
only
appeal
bond,
but
you’d
have
to
give
an
absolute
right
for
everyone
to
appeal,
and
therefore,
it
would
necessitate
the
overruling
yourselves
and
ortwein
v.
schwab,
and
united
states
v.
kras,
and
really
what
you
would
be
doing
is
extending
the
rule
(inaudible).
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
a
situation
where
one
has
to
post
a
double
bond,
but
that
is
to
protect
the
judgment
that
the
plaintiff
had
received
in
the
justice
court.
but
if
the
defendant
appeals
and
wants
to
stay
the
execution
then
that’s
where
the
double
bond
comes
in,
as
to
protect.
for
instance,
if
one
wants
to
appeal
from
the
justice
court
in
west
virginia,
you
can
appeal
by
only
posting
a
bond
equal
the
amount
of
the
judgment.
it’s
only
the
execution
that
one
is
denied
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
in
other
words,
if
the
jp
rules
against
the
defendant
and
the
jp
court,
and
if
the
defendant
wants
to
appeal
to
a
court
of
record,
all
he
has
to
post
is
$300.00
to
cover
the
judgment
plus
cost,
but
if
he
wants
to
stay,
then
he
has
to
post
double
the
bond.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
there
was
also
a
statement
made
that
his
court
is
concurrent
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that’s
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
i
think
there
is
important
--
it’s
generally
the
amount
of
the
judgment.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
there’s
been
some
specific
question
concerning
concurrent
jurisdiction,
and
in
fact,
it’s
not
concurrent
jurisdiction.
for
instance,
you
can
not
get
in
the
circuit
court,
the
first
court
of
record
in
west
virginia,
if
you’re
seeking
anything
less
than
$50.00.
you
don’t’
have
a
right.
you
have
to
go
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
court.
also
consider
this,
here
you
have
--
you
can’t
consider
only
$300.00,
a
justice
of
the
peace
can
award
$15.00.
now,
if
he
awards
$15.00,
the
double
bond
isn’t
going
to
be
sufficient,
because
automatically
you
have
got
interest,
cost,
and
you’ve
got
this
$10.00
fee
that
goes
to
the
circuit
court
which
has
to
come
out
of
the
$15.00
over
the
original
judgment.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that
is
your
honor,
if
the
higher
court
does
not
say
that
--
if
the
higher
court
does
have
the
opportunity
--
if
damages
occurred
that
higher
court
can
assess
for
damages
that
would
come
out
of
the
additional
$300.00.
as
well
as
other
cost
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
cost,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
there’s
a
whole
list
of
costs
your
honor.
for
instance,
there’s
a
$5.00
fee
for
bringing
the
action.
there’s
$2.00
fee
for
service.
of
course
there’s
$1.00
fee
for
the
bond.
you
have
a
$1.50
for
summoning
and
return
of
the
jury.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
the
judgment
--
the
plaintiff
who
received
the
judgment
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that’s
right
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no,
your
honor,
again
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
we
must
consider
also
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
if
the
defendant
who
posts
a
$300.00
bond
--
i
mean
a
$600.00
bond
in
this
instance.
should
he
lose
on
appeal,
if
he
only
loses
the
$300.00
plus
cost,
interest,
etcetera.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
your
honor,
as
i
stated
before,
you
can’t
i
don’t
think,
concern
yourselves
strictly
with
cases
that
involve
$300.00.
as
i
stated
earlier,
many
times
this
is
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
and
many
times
people
come
in
to
this
court
with
$50.00
for
instance.
they
ask
for
judgment
for
$50.00.
in
that
case,
it
would
be
double
the
amount,
and
it’s
not
too
hard
to
believe
that
cost
will
amount
to
$50.00
that’s
what
i’m
trying
to
say.
consider
also
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
is
a
layman,
and
possibly
the
legislature
felt
that
they
should
try
and
setting
the
double
bond,
would
setup
a
rule
of
thumb
and
that
the
jp,
he
is
a
layman,
should
not
have
to
exercise
discretion
and
decide,
well
what
--
how
much
will
i
assess
to
“a”
for
his
appeal
to
a
court
of
record,
and
how
much
should
i
assess
“b?”
it’s
just
a
rule
of
thumb.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
could
they
bar
appeal?
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
oh!
excuse
me,
what’s
in
the
constitution
is
that
one
has
the
right
to
appeal,
but
as
set
out
by
law,
and
of
course
our
legislature
decided
that
the
double
bond
is
what
is
needed.
now
again,
i
like
to
--
i
wish
to
reiterate
that
to
appeal
the
defendant
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
court
doesn’t
have
to
post
a
double
bond.
all
he
has
to
do
is
post,
justice
marshall.
all
he
has
to
do
is
post
a
bond
that
equals
the
judgment
that
just
covers
the
judgment.
so
what
we’re
concerned
ourselves
here
now,
does
he
have
a
right,
an
absolute
right
to
an
execution?
and
of
course
it’s
our
contention
that
he
does
not.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
occurred
with
counsel
for
the
appellant
i
must
assume
that
it
was
quite
unusual
for
the
appellee
to
submit
some
information
to
this
court
in
opposition
to
his
suggestion
for
mootness.
at
the
time,
it
was
my
opinion
that
this
case
before
this
honorable
court
was
not
moot,
because
of
reece
versus
geis.
however,
upon
further
research
it
is
my
conclusion
now
that
this
case
is
moot
based
upon
reece
versus
geis,
and
therefore,
this
court
need
not
concern
itself
with
the
issues
now
presented
before
this
court.
if
the
court
pleases,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no,
your
honor,
i
haven’t.
i
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
my
original
--
i
was
requested
to
respond
to
suggestion
of
mootness
on
behalf
of
a
counsel
for
the
appellant,
so
i
would
assume
now
that
the
motion
is
before
the
court
that
i
could
change
my
position
and
argue
that
yes,
it
is
moot.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
normal
procedure
is
that
the
appellee
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no,
your
honor,
within
the
last
quite
frankly
though,
within
the
last
several
weeks.
first,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
this
case
is
moot,
and
i
would
like
to
refer
back
to
reece
versus
geis,
and
that
the
case
before
this
court
now
originated
in
1969
and
reece
versus
geis
started
i
believe
in
1972,
or
possibly
1973,
and
was
decided
in
june
1973.
in
that
case,
we
had
basically
the
same
issues.
we
had
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
had
a
statutory
fee
due
him,
which
was
$2.50
on
each
case
or
each
judgment
that
he
executed
on.
the
court
in
justice
--
in
reece
versus
geis
ruled
that
because
of
this
$2.50
fee,
it
was
a
pecuniary
interest
that
the
jp
possessed,
and
therefore
the
jp
was
disqualified
from
giving
a
judgment
on
the
case
and
as
a
result
that
judgment
that
he
did
give
because
of
this
pecuniary
interest
was
void.
now,
we
contend
now
that
reece
versus
geis
does
apply
to
the
instant
case,
and
therefore,
warner
--
justice
warner
in
this
case,
his
judgment
as
to
patterson
is
likewise
void.
now,
we
get
in
to
the
question
of
retroactivity.
does
reece
in
that
patterson
started
before
reece,
does
reece
versus
geis
apply
now
to
patterson
versus
warner?
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
i’m
not
--
quite
frankly,
i’m
not
sure
what
this
court
can
do
--
as
to
decide
whether
it
is
moot
or
rather
remand
it
to
the
district
court.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
if
you
let
me
continue
justice
brennan,
justice
cardozo
in
answer
to
whether
state
decisions
are
retroactive
or
not,
said
and
that
a
state
may
make
a
choice
for
itself
between
the
principle
of
forward
operation
and
the
relation
backwards.
and
i
would
like
to
submit
that
that
the
west
virginia
law
is
that,
and
i
cite
the
case
of
falconer
versus
simmons,
it’s
not
in
the
brief.
51
west
virginia
172
41
s.e.
193,
it’s
a
1902
case
which
says
that
“it
makes
every
decision
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
retroactive,
except
for
one
particular
exception.”
and
of
course
this
case
does
not
fall
within
that
exception.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
so
therefore
--
so
what
i’m
saying
is
that
reece
versus
geis
does
apply
to
patterson.
therefore,
the
judgment
of
patterson
or
warner
against
patterson
is
likewise
void,
and
therefore,
this
court
should
not
concern
itself
with
the
question
of
whether
--
in
fact
there
was
a
proper
hearing
below
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
courts,
or
whether
the
appeal
bond
is
constitutional
or
not.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
as
well
as
i
can
interpret
that
case,
your
honor,
yes.
that’s
the
way
i
interpret
it.
if
not
that,
at
least
this
court,
we
could
assume
that
there’s
limited
retroactivity
and
that
the
west
virginia
court
surely
follows
the
common
law
or
the
rules
as
were
reflected
and
set
out
in
united
states
versus
schooner
peggy
and
link
letter
versus
walker.
we
contend
that
this
case
is
now
moot,
and
this
court
should
not
have
to
consider
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
whether
due
process
was
afforded
to
mr.
patterson
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
court
and
whether
the
appeal
bond
is
constitutional.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
i
don’t
understand
justice
douglas,
what
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
now
that’s
my
next
argument
in
support
of
mootness.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
you
use
the
reasoning
behind
the
abstention
doctrine.
this
isn’t
an
abstention
doctrine
as
such,
because
we’re
not
asking
this
court
to
abstain
and
let
the
state
court
rule
because
in
fact
the
state
court
has
already
ruled
and
under
the
abstention
doctrine,
this
court
even
though
it
has
jurisdiction
of
cases
under
federal
constitution
and
federal
statute,
you
will
not
--
you
will
avoid
making
a
federal
constitutional
decision
on
a
federal
question
when
you
can
leave
it
to
the
state
to
determine.
and
in
this
case,
the
state
of
west
virginia
has
determined.
so
for
the
reasoning,
under
the
abstention
doctrine,
even
though
this
isn’t
an
abstention
doctrine
and
that
we
are
not
asking
you
to
abstain,
until
the
court
has
ruled.
what
i’m
saying
is,
our
court
has
already
ruled.
there’s
no
reason
for
this
court
to
rule.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
exactly
what
i’m
saying.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that’s
right
your
honor.
that’s
correct.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
also
that
this
would
be
similarly
what
happened
in
the
texas
railroad
commission
versus
pullman.
and
that
here,
we
have
mr.
patterson
who
has
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
judgment
of
justice
warner,
saying
that
the
judgment
denies
him
rights
under
the
federal
law
and
state
law,
and
that
therefore,
the
justice
lacks
jurisdiction
to
make
any
judgment
in
the
case.
and
i
would
assume
that
this
case
is
very
similar
to
that,
and
again
reiterate
that
leaves
nothing
for
this
court
to
decide
as
regards
to
what
i’m
speaking
of
only
to
the
questions
of
due
process,
whether
due
process
was
afforded
mr.
patterson
in
the
justice
court
or
whether
the
appeal
bond
is
constitutional
or
not.
now
to
his
argument
as
to
whether
--
i
think
the
court
may
be
a
little
confused
now
as
to
what
appellant
is
trying
to
argue.
he
is
saying
this
i
think
basically,
i’ll
try
to
simplify
some.
he’s
saying
that
patterson
was
denied
a
fair
hearing
in
the
justice
court
because
warner
had
a
pecuniary
interest,
and
therefore,
he
didn’t
have
a
fair
hearing,
so
it’s
no
hearing
at
all.
so
as
a
result,
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
an
appeal,
and
we
contend
and
say
that
--
we
contend
that
there
is
no
absolute
right
to
appeal
and
we
cite
ortwein
versus
schwab
and
that
ortwein
versus
schwab,
this
court
determined
that
one
did
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
from
administrative
hearing
for
judicial
review.
and
we
say
likewise,
one
does
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
from
justice
court
for
judicial
review.
and
we
could
assume
that
the
appeal
bond
that
one
pays
to
appeal
from
a
justice
court
is
very
comparable
to
the
fee
of
$25.00
that
one
had
to
pay
to
appeal
from
the
administrative
hearing
in
ortwein
to
a
court
there.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
pardon?
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
as
far
as
being
a
fee.
what
i’m
saying
is
there’s
not
an
absolute
right
to
an
appeal.
that’s
what
i’m
saying.
as
in
ortwein,
you
don’t
have
an
absolute
right
to
appeal
from
a
jp
court
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
i’m
directing
my
argument
to
this
due
process
argument
now,
not
to
as
equal
protection
argument.
now
if
this
court
should
determine
that
the
jp
did
in
fact
have
a
pecuniary
interest,
and
therefore,
he
should’ve
disqualified
himself
and
that
he
didn’t
--
his
judgment
is
void.
and
should
you
further
question
whether
the
appeal
bond
acts
as
a
bar
to
access
to
a
court
of
record
then
i
cite
the
kras
case
for
the
proposition
and
rule
that
one
does
not
have
an
absolute
rule
to
initial
judicial
determination
of
one’s
claim.
and
again,
i
would
compare
the
appeal
bond
to
that
of
the
$50.00
filing
fee
that
one
had
to
pay
in
kras.
another
argument
that
the
appellant
uses
is
that
well,
here
we
have
mr.
patterson
who
is
forced
into
a
jp
court
and
supposedly
had
a
hearing,
but
yet
it
wasn’t
a
fair
hearing,
so
it's
no
hearing,
but
to
appeal,
you’re
making
the
man
pay
a
double
bond.
well,
if
the
court
is
to
believe
that
argument,
then
as
has
been
mentioned
earlier,
any
amount,
any
fee
of
any
amount
would
stand
in
the
way
not
only
appeal
bond,
but
you’d
have
to
give
an
absolute
right
for
everyone
to
appeal,
and
therefore,
it
would
necessitate
the
overruling
yourselves
and
ortwein
v.
schwab,
and
united
states
v.
kras,
and
really
what
you
would
be
doing
is
extending
the
rule
(inaudible).
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
a
situation
where
one
has
to
post
a
double
bond,
but
that
is
to
protect
the
judgment
that
the
plaintiff
had
received
in
the
justice
court.
but
if
the
defendant
appeals
and
wants
to
stay
the
execution
then
that’s
where
the
double
bond
comes
in,
as
to
protect.
for
instance,
if
one
wants
to
appeal
from
the
justice
court
in
west
virginia,
you
can
appeal
by
only
posting
a
bond
equal
the
amount
of
the
judgment.
it’s
only
the
execution
that
one
is
denied
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
in
other
words,
if
the
jp
rules
against
the
defendant
and
the
jp
court,
and
if
the
defendant
wants
to
appeal
to
a
court
of
record,
all
he
has
to
post
is
$300.00
to
cover
the
judgment
plus
cost,
but
if
he
wants
to
stay,
then
he
has
to
post
double
the
bond.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
there
was
also
a
statement
made
that
his
court
is
concurrent
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that’s
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
i
think
there
is
important
--
it’s
generally
the
amount
of
the
judgment.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
there’s
been
some
specific
question
concerning
concurrent
jurisdiction,
and
in
fact,
it’s
not
concurrent
jurisdiction.
for
instance,
you
can
not
get
in
the
circuit
court,
the
first
court
of
record
in
west
virginia,
if
you’re
seeking
anything
less
than
$50.00.
you
don’t’
have
a
right.
you
have
to
go
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
court.
also
consider
this,
here
you
have
--
you
can’t
consider
only
$300.00,
a
justice
of
the
peace
can
award
$15.00.
now,
if
he
awards
$15.00,
the
double
bond
isn’t
going
to
be
sufficient,
because
automatically
you
have
got
interest,
cost,
and
you’ve
got
this
$10.00
fee
that
goes
to
the
circuit
court
which
has
to
come
out
of
the
$15.00
over
the
original
judgment.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that
is
your
honor,
if
the
higher
court
does
not
say
that
--
if
the
higher
court
does
have
the
opportunity
--
if
damages
occurred
that
higher
court
can
assess
for
damages
that
would
come
out
of
the
additional
$300.00.
as
well
as
other
cost
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
cost,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
there’s
a
whole
list
of
costs
your
honor.
for
instance,
there’s
a
$5.00
fee
for
bringing
the
action.
there’s
$2.00
fee
for
service.
of
course
there’s
$1.00
fee
for
the
bond.
you
have
a
$1.50
for
summoning
and
return
of
the
jury.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
the
judgment
--
the
plaintiff
who
received
the
judgment
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
that’s
right
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no,
your
honor,
again
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
we
must
consider
also
--
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
if
the
defendant
who
posts
a
$300.00
bond
--
i
mean
a
$600.00
bond
in
this
instance.
should
he
lose
on
appeal,
if
he
only
loses
the
$300.00
plus
cost,
interest,
etcetera.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
well,
your
honor,
as
i
stated
before,
you
can’t
i
don’t
think,
concern
yourselves
strictly
with
cases
that
involve
$300.00.
as
i
stated
earlier,
many
times
this
is
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
and
many
times
people
come
in
to
this
court
with
$50.00
for
instance.
they
ask
for
judgment
for
$50.00.
in
that
case,
it
would
be
double
the
amount,
and
it’s
not
too
hard
to
believe
that
cost
will
amount
to
$50.00
that’s
what
i’m
trying
to
say.
consider
also
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
is
a
layman,
and
possibly
the
legislature
felt
that
they
should
try
and
setting
the
double
bond,
would
setup
a
rule
of
thumb
and
that
the
jp,
he
is
a
layman,
should
not
have
to
exercise
discretion
and
decide,
well
what
--
how
much
will
i
assess
to
“a”
for
his
appeal
to
a
court
of
record,
and
how
much
should
i
assess
“b?”
it’s
just
a
rule
of
thumb.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
yes,
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
could
they
bar
appeal?
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
no.
mr.
philip
d.
gaujot
oh!
excuse
me,
what’s
in
the
constitution
is
that
one
has
the
right
to
appeal,
but
as
set
out
by
law,
and
of
course
our
legislature
decided
that
the
double
bond
is
what
is
needed.
now
again,
i
like
to
--
i
wish
to
reiterate
that
to
appeal
the
defendant
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
court
doesn’t
have
to
post
a
double
bond.
all
he
has
to
do
is
post,
justice
marshall.
all
he
has
to
do
is
post
a
bond
that
equals
the
judgment
that
just
covers
the
judgment.
so
what
we’re
concerned
ourselves
here
now,
does
he
have
a
right,
an
absolute
right
to
an
execution?
and
of
course
it’s
our
contention
that
he
does
not.
