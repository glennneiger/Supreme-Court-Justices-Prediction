supposing
you
went
into
the
west
virginia
state
court,
if
the
judgment
here
were
affirmed,
and
sought
to
enjoin
execution
on
the
grounds
--
on
the

judgment,
on
the
grounds
that
that
judgment
was
void,
would
you
prevail
under
the

case,
do
you
think?

do
you
read
that
capable
of
repetition
and
needing
review
language
of
moore
against
ogilvy,
and
cases
like
that,
is
being
the
general
doctrine
of
mootness,

perhaps
an
exception
in
election
cases?

that
turned
down

of

injunction
not
on

didn’t
it,

what
are
damages
for

if

than

mr.

justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
higinbotham,
what’s
the
delay
between
the
judgment
in
the
west
virginia
court
of
record,
and
judgment
in
the
west
virginia
court
of
appeals,
or
supreme
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
were
two
years,
i
take
it
that
the
court
of
record
would
be
entitled
to
require
two
years
interest
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
rather
than
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you’re
not
talking
just
about
bond
premiums
then.
you’re
talking
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
in
the
long
run,
an
unsuccessful
appellant
to
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
can
be
held
for
costs
that
aren’t
covered
by
a
bond.
i
would
think
if
west
virginia
procedures
like
most
states.
you
know,
you
can
be
assessed
cost
on
appeal
and
be
liable
for
them,
even
though
you
may
not
have
put
up
a
bond.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
can’t
know
if
it’s
one
year’s
interest
when
you’re
talking
about
a
simple
double
bond
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
asking
you
about.
you’re
saying
it's
one
year,
but
there
should
be
more
than
a
year’s
delay,
it
could
be
more
than
a
year’s
interest.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
their
question
–it's
not
immediately
apparent
to
me
that
an
ignorant
jp
automatically
benefits
the
plaintiff
rather
than
the
defendant.
suppose
you
have
a
sophisticated
question
of
release
or
something
of
that
that
can
be
to
the
advantage
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
it
is
retroactive
so
that
you
can’t
let
the
execution
on
this
judgment.
the
controversy
still
exists
that
is
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
mr.
justice
stewart’s
questions
to
mr.
higinbotham,
mr.
gaujot,
suggest
any
additional
ground
of
mootness
to
you
that
perhaps
the
remedy
which
he
sought
if
it
isn’t
going
to
avail
his
client
anything,
perhaps
there
isn’t
any
real
case
or
controversy
here,
because
of
the
pauper
status
of
the
petitioner?
in
other
words,
if
it
doesn’t
facilitate
this
man’s
appeal
in
order
to
get
the
double
bond
provision
stricken
down
and
have
a
single
bond
substituted
for
it,
is
that
a
real
life
case
and
controversy
between
the
jp
and
mr.
patterson?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i’d
read
it
differently.
you
say
that
it’s
just
we
want
to
supersede
that
you
have
the
double
bond,
or
stay
the
execution?
