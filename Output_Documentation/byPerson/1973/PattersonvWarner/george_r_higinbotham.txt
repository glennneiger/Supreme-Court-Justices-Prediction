mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
from
state
of
west
virginia.
it
was
a
three-judge
federal
court
below
that
held
a
state
statute
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
as
being
constitutional.
that
statute
provides
that
one
who
seeks
to
appeal
from
a
hearing
and
a
judgment
or
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
state
of
west
virginia,
it
required
to
posts
a
double
bond,
a
bond
twice
the
amount
of
the
judgment.
we
challenge
that
as
unconstitutional
denying
equal
protection
and
due
process
of
law.
before
i
begin
with
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
subject
of
mootness.
we
have
made
the
unusual
move
perhaps
for
an
appellant
whose
bringing
the
case
before
the
court,
of
suggesting
that
our
case
may
be
moot.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
am
not
arguing
for
mootness.
i
am
fulfilling
what
i
believe
is
my
duty
to
the
court,
and
informing
the
court
of
all
the
issues
and
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
that
there
was
a
case
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
that
went
to
the
state
supreme
court
in
west
virginia
that
was
virtually
identical,
practically
it’s
not
much
different.
that
case
raised
same
issues
as
are
presented
here.
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
declared
the
judgment
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
in
that
case
void.
another
case,
an
older
case
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
said
that
when
you
have
a
pecuniary
interest
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
his
judgment,
then
the
judgment
is
void
ab
initio,
that
was
in
a
criminal
context.
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
reece
case,
this
is
the
name
of
the
case,
reece
v.
geis
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
since
the
three-judge
court,
yes
sir.
it’s
just
very
recent,
1972.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
reece,
r-e-e-c-e
versus
geis,
g-e-i-s.
i’ve
cited
it
in
my
motion
or
suggestion
of
mootness,
the
--
it’
198
s.e.
2d.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
198
s.e.
2d,
i
am
not
sure
what
page
it
is
sir.
it
is
in
the
record,
i
have
cited
it
in
the
motion.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
there’s
been
no
change
in
the
statute
at
all.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
think
the
conclusion
would
be
the
same.
we
have
a
decision
by
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
and
by
the
three-judge
court
that
the
double
bond
has
a
rational
basis.
getting
back
to
the
mootness
thing,
let
me
refer
to
that
again.
the
effect
of
that
case
was,
it
said
that
the
judgment
was
but
moot.
the
judgment
was
void.
that
restored
the
status
quo
of
the
parties.
in
other
words,
that
judgment
of
the
jp
was
void,
but
it
wasn’t
the
underlying
claim
that
was
void.
therefore,
the
creditor
could
go
right
back
in
the
same
jp
court,
and
again
sue
the
same
debtor,
the
same
situation
applies
here
and
for
those
reasons
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
as
a
practical
matter
now,
that’s
what
they’re
supposed
to
do.
as
a
practical
now
even
though
they
haven’t
done
and
the
jp
waives
the
collection
of
appease
that
may
have
been
perceived
otherwise.
[voice
overlap]
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
the
one
that
the
reece
court
found
wasn't
affirmed.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes
sir,
exactly.
$2.50
for
execution
$0.35
for
mailing
it.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
they
said
that
was
why
it
was
void,
but
practically
speaking
and
i
think
this
is
the
key
to
that
thing.
the
reece
court
declared
the
judgment
void
below.
now
there’s
been
no
rush
by
creditors
or
jp’s
or
like
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
to
suddenly
come
around
and
say,
“that
statute
was
void,
we’re
going
to
return
all
of
the
moneys
that
we
have
collected
through
the
years.”
therefore,
it’s
not
a
retroactive
application.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
he
hasn’t
executed
yet,
your
honor.
he
did
not
execute
it,
at
that
--
we
sought
to
appeal,
sought
to
post
the
bond
and
so
on,
we
could
not
post
the
bond
and
that’s
what
gave
rise
to
this
case,
went
in
to
federal
court
and
joined
it,
and
so
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
there
again
it
adds
the
question
of
retroactivity,
and
i
don’t
know
what
the
three-judge
court,
i
mean
a
west
virginia
court
would
do.
they
would
have
to
decide
whether
reece
was
retroactive,
and
if
they
decided
reece
was
retroactive,
that
means
everybody,
all
through
the
years
would
have
to
return
their
moneys.
i
would
hope
to
get
attorney’s
fees
if
i
could
get
something
like
that,
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
very
likely.
but
i
think
the
more
important
thing
is
here,
is
its
fact
that
the
creditor
couldn’t
go
back
in
to
the
jp
court,
and
considering
the
cases
on
mootness,
if
this
court
has
decided,
if
there’s
a
likelihood
of
repetition
of
the
conduct
that
complained
them,
then
the
case
is
not
moot,
and
there’s
a
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
creditor
would
do
that,
because
it
is
cheaper
for
him
to
go
to
a
jp
court.
he’s
gone
to
the
same
jp
before,
and
won.
there’s
a
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
win
again,
and
he
doesn’t
have
to
have
an
attorney
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
i
don’t
think
it’s
just
election
cases.
the
general
rule
that
i
understand
mootness
is
that
there
must
be
a
controversy
at
all
stages
of
the
litigation.
in
the
w.t.
grant
case,
u.s.
versus
w.t.
grant
that
was
a
case
where
they
had
the
interlocutory
directorship
and
the
director
says,
they
sought
an
injunction
against
him
and
he
says,
“i’ve
dropped
my
directorship,
so
there’s
no
longer
an
interlocking
situation.”
that
is
only
one
factor
to
be
considered,
that
he
said
that
he
would
drop
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
think
that
was
a
mootness
case.
that
was
a
mootness
case,
yes
sir,
and
he
said
that
the
fact
that
it
may
just
like
the
judgment
here.
it’s
void.
he’s
not
doing
what
was
complained
of,
but
it’s
very
likely
to
come
up
again.
the
act
could
repeat
itself.
another
case
that
i
would
rely
upon
is
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
sir,
i’m
sorry?
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
it
didn’t
consider
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
they
considered
the
second
half
of
the
statute.
the
second
half
of
this
statute
is
a
double
bond
also
in
eviction
cases
plus
one
year
rent.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
they
did
not
have
this
part
of
the
statute
beforehand.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i
don’t
think
it
is.
i’m
not
arguing
for
mootness
sir.
i’m
just
saying
that
there
may
be
a
question
of
mootness.
it’s
not
my
function
to
decide
whether
it’s
moot
or
not,
by
avoiding
the
issue.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
raise
it.
i
think
that
it
was
--
he
did
not
do
it,
then
i
thought
that
it
was
my
function
to
do
it,
so
i
did
raise
it.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
10
years
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
--
in
west
virginia
so
he
can
go
right
back
there
and
sue
them
again.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
it
has
not.
what
he’s
doing
is
suing
on
the
note,
and
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
keys
to
this
case.
there
is
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
jp’s
court
with
a
court
of
record,
and
i
think
that
gives
rise
to
our
equal
protection
argument
here,
which
i
would
like
to
turn
to
now
if
the
court
has
no
more
further
questions
on
mootness.
we
have
painted
a
picture
of
the
jp
system
in
west
virginia,
words
and
all,
we
pointed
out
a
lot
of
flaws
in
it.
the
reece
case
bares
us
out
on
one
of
the
flaws
that
the
jp
has
an
interest
in
the
judgment.
we’ve
also
pointed
out
that
a
jp
is
not
an
expert
in
law.
he
is
not
a
learned
judge.
he’s
not
required
to
be
an
attorney
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
your
honor,
what
i
am
doing
is
--
what
i
am
suggesting
is
when
you
focus
upon
the
double
bond,
to
whether
it
is
constitutional
or
unconstitutional,
to
look
at
the
entire
system.
we’re
saying
that
the
double
bond
is
unconstitutional,
because
we
have
very
compelling
reasons
to
want
to
get
into
a
court
of
record.
when
we
have
raised
a
question
of
law,
and
i
think
it’s
pretty
well
indicated
in
the
record
here,
we
said
that
we
had
a
substantive
defense
under
the
ucc,
and
the
creditor’s
attorney
when
he
answered
the
complaint
in
this
action
said,
“we
admit
it.
this
is
not
a
case
of
obstruction.
you
really
do
have
a
good
question
of
law.”
i
think
that’s
very
significant.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
single
bond
and
that
raises
first
two
classes.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
judgment
plus
interest,
so
far
that’s
the
way
the
statute
reads.
there’s
no
damages
for
the
delay
demanded
on
a
single
bond.
the
statute
which
covers
that
is
west
virginia
code
58514,
which
would
indicate
that
in
a
court
of
record,
only
a
single
bond
would
be
required
that
would
be
on
the
judgment
and
perhaps
on
the
interest
of
6%
that
can
be
awarded
to
the
appellant
if
he
ultimately
loses.
so
what
the
court
of
record
appellant
must
post,
that
he
must
post
a
bond
like
a
jp
appellant
post,
he
would
post
a
bond
in
the
amount
of
$318.00
or
posing
$300.00
judgments
in
two
different
systems.
he
would
post
a
bond
of
$318.00,
whereas,
the
jp
appellant
must
post
a
bond
of
$600.00.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
not
in
the
court
of
record
system.
however,
there
is
a
provision
for
cost
in
the
jp
system.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that’s
one
of
the
things
brought
out
by
reece.
they
said
it
had
a
rational
basis,
because
the
double
bond
was
for
the
judgment,
plus
cost,
plus
interest
and
as
appellee
points
out
and
that
as
is
provided
in
our
state
statutes
you
are
entitled
to
damages
for
delay.
when
you
add
these
up
mathematically,
and
this
is
something
i
think
is
very
important.
just
the
simple
mathematics
indicates
that
there
is
not
a
rational
basis
for
a
double
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i
don’t
know,
your
honor
that
seems
to
me
to
be
interesting.
let
me
point
it
out
to
you
exactly.
you
are
entitled
to
in
the
jp
system
the
bond
under
the
reece
decision
would
be
to
cover
the
judgment
which
would
be
$300.00,
6%
interest
that
adds
up
to
$318.00
total,
or
no
6%
on
$300
is
18
more
dollars,
so
you
have
$318.00.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
and
you
have
court
cost
to
appeal
the
cost
to
go
from
jp
court
to
a
court
of
record
is
$10.00.
then
you’re
entitled
on
that
10%
on
the
cost,
the
judgment,
the
interest
of
6%,
and
the
court
cost
of
$10,
you
are
entitled
to
10%
damages
for
delay
on
that.
that
adds
up
to
a
maximum
judgment
would
ever
be
rendered
against
a
appellant
from
a
jp
system.
if
he
loses,
it’s
$360.80.
now,
if
you
are
posting
a
bond
of
$600.00,
there
is
$290.00
left
that
has
not
been
articulated
as
i
don’t
know
what
it’s
for.
there
is
no
articulated
state
standard
for
why
$293.00
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
$318.00
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
all
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
we
say
it
denies
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it’s
in
our
equal
protections
argument
your
honor,
it
is
part
3.
are
you
referring
to
the
brief
itself?
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
it’s
in
part
3
(a).
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
argument
is
3
(a)
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
generally
i
am
not
an
expert
on
that
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
any
longer
than
a
year.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
but
generally,
practically
speaking
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
the
state
cases
have
indicated
that
generally,
your
bond
from
a
court
of
record
to
go
to
the
highest
court
in
the
state,
we
only
have
one
step
appellate
system,
is
only
an
amount
of
the
judgment,
plus
the
interest
of
one
year.
yes,
sir,
that
practically
speaking
is
what
is
done.
there’s
not
many
cases
on
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
the
judge
below.
whoever
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it’s
up
to
the
judge
to
decide
what
it’s
going
to
be.
but
practically
speaking,
it’s
the
judgment
plus
one
year’s
interest,
but
here
we
have
two
years.
we
also
suggest
that
the
difference
in
treatment
in
the
jp
system,
in
the
court
of
record
system
goes
much
farther.
and
we
also
argue
that
the
compelling
state
interest
test
should
be
applied
here,
not
just
the
rational
basis
test.
we
have
tried
to
paint
the
picture
of
a
non
expert
deciding
questions
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
but
if
you
decide,
we
made
the
same
argument
to
the
west
virginia
supreme
court,
and
they
decided
it
had
a
rational
basis.
you
could
do
the
same
thing.
so
i
would
prefer
to
argue
my
entire
case
to
play
it
safe.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
what
we
try
to
present
is
that
there
is
a
difference
in
treatment
all
through
the
court
of
record
system
and
the
jp
system.
we
have
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
they
didn’t
your
honor,
they
said
that
the
bond
protects
the
judgment
cost
and
interest,
and
that’s
as
far
as
they
went
in
the
reece
case.
that’s
the
most
recent
definition
of
why
you
required
a
double
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it
did,
but
they
just
said
that
it
has
a
rational
basis,
because
a
double
bond
protects
a
judgment,
cost,
and
interest.
now,
where
they
came
mathematically,
i
don’t
see
that
it
does,
but
that’s
what
they
said.
so
that’s
the
close
latest
definition
of
what
the
bonds
function
is.
they
have
defined
the
function
of
that
double
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
reece
versus
geis.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
the
recent
one
--
yes,
sir
and
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
i
was.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i
think
twice,
$18.00.
i
think
that
is
probably
very
close
to
what
lindsey,
very
close
to
the
lindsey
analogy
in
this
case.
in
lindsey,
you
had
a
double
bond
also,
so
if
you
had
to
put
up
assured,
you
would
probably
have
not
that
greater
difference,
but
if
you
go
all
the
way
down
the
line
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
winner
take
all,
we
don’t
have
a
winner
take
all
situation
here,
but
if
you
follow
the
mathematics
of
it
all
the
way
down
the
line,
you
figure
out
that
the
state
objectives
of
protecting
the
interests
and
10%
damages
for
delay,
and
so
on,
which
you
wind
up
with
is
ultimately,
maybe
not
a
winner
take
all
situation,
but
if
the
appellant
in
the
jp
system
loses,
he
loses
$60.00
more
than
does
an
appellant
in
a
court
of
record
system.
it’s
going
to
cost
him
$60.00
more
than
it
will
cost
a
court
of
record
appellant,
if
he
loses,
and
i
don’t
see
if
that’s
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
not
just
premium,
sir.
we’re
talking
about
the
state’s
objectives
also
deny
equal
protection
law.
as
the
way
they
have
spelled
it
out
as
a
result
of
the
reece
case,
you’re
paying
interest
twice,
you’re
paying
twice
the
premium,
and
that
adds
up
to
$60.00
more
than
the
court
of
record
appellant
pays.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
but
we’re
posing
here
an
indigent.
we’re
posing
an
indigent,
that’s
a
frame
of
reference.
we
have
an
indigent
who
can
not
post
the
bond
in
jp
system.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
not
quite.
this
is
where
our
argument
comes
to
as
lindsey
recognized,
there
is
this
gray
area,
and
there’s
going
to
be
some
people
who
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
post
that
bond.
we
agree.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
overturn
arnold
versus
union
national.
we’re
asking
only
for
a
single
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
alright,
let
me
take
it
again.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
well
it
was
stipulated.
it
was
found
as
a
matter
by
the
court
below
that
it
would
be
6%
surety.
so,
that’s
what
it
would
cost
on
the
bond.
let
me
go
through
the
mathematics
again
for
you.
in
the
jp
system,
we
have
a
judgment
of
$300.00,
interest
to
be
charged
on
that,
that’s
under
code
4765
is
6%.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
sir?
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
this
is
statutory.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
one
year’s
interest.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
in
the
court
of
record
system.
i’m
just
talking
about
the
jp
system
now.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
that’s
possible,
but
that’s
not
the
way
the
statute
was
set
up.
if
you
look
at
the
second
half
of
that
statute,
and
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
to
construe
them
together.
the
second
half
of
the
statute
is
also
an
appeal
statute,
double
bond
to
appeal
an
eviction
plus
one
year’s
rent.
that
means
that
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
this
was
what
was
anticipated
by
the
legislature
that
it
would
only
take
one
year
to
appeal
a
decision
of
a
jp.
it
would
not
take
any
longer
than
one
year.
in
addition
to
which,
we
have
a
two-term
rule
in
the
state
of
west
virginia.
that
is,
if
you
appeal
from
a
jp
to
a
court
of
record,
you’ve
got
to
bring
that
on
for
hearing
within
two
terms
of
court.
that’s
within
one
year.
so
when
you
take
it
in
that
frame
of
reference,
it’s
not
going
to
be
any
longer
than
one
year.
when
you
look
at
the
statute
itself,
the
second
half
of
the
statute,
which
refers
to
one
year’s
rent
in
an
eviction
situation,
plus
the
two-term
rule,
then
it’s
very
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
interest
will
not
be
more
than
one
year.
i
would
like
to
return
again
to
the
compelling
state
interest
argument
that
we
have.
we
suggest
that
there’s
not
equal
treatment
in
the
two
systems,
in
the
court
of
record
system
or
in
the
justice
peace
system.
you
have
a
bias,
which
is
built
into
the
law.
the
reece
case
bares
us
out
on
that
argument.
you
do
have
an
admitted
jp
based
with
a
question
of
law
and
he
is
not
an
expert
in
it.
we
have
in
the
same
situation,
a
person
who
has
the
money
can
afford
to
go
into
a
court
of
record,
he
can
post
that
bond.
whereas,
an
indigent
cannot
post
a
bond.
i
realize
this
raises
the
question
of
wealth
classification,
and
this
court
is
not
seem
fit
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
compelling
state
interest
standard
applies
to
wealth
classification.
but
what
i’m
suggesting
is,
it’s
just
not
the
wealth
classification
and
there
is
something
more
here
than
the
wealth
classification.
that
is
the
unequal
treatment
in
the
two
court
systems.
when
you
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
creditor
could
have
gone
into
either
one
of
those
courts,
it’s
his
choice.
he
could
go
into
either
court
of
record
system
where
my
client
would’ve
had
a
learned
judge
who
is
not
biased.
he
had
--
no
fees
were
going
to
be
accrued
to
him.
then
the
compelling
state
interest
state
standard
applies
here.
and
it’s
--
the
burden
of
course
then
of
the
state
to
show
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
for
the
discrimination
on
the
bond.
we
also
suggest
that
this
is
like
the
boddie
case.
i’m
not
saying
that
this
is
a
boddie
case.
we’re
not
saying
that
the
contract
creates
a
fundamental
interest.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
equal
treatment
in
the
court
is
a
fundamental
interest,
like
the
fundamental
interest
found
in
boddie.
boddie
stands
alone
that’s
clear
from
kras
and
ortwein
decision.
we’re
not
saying
that
the
contract
equals
marriage.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
the
right
to
be
heard
and
to
be
treated
equally
within
a
court
system.
equal
treatment
within
a
court
system
is
a
matter
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
you
can
appear
on
your
own
in
the
court
of
record.
one
of
our
arguments,
of
course
is
that
if
you
have
a
lawyer
who
is
trying
to
argue
matters
of
law
before
a
jp
that
more
than
likely
he
is
not
going
to
know
what
you
are
talking
about?
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
if
judges
usually
would
have
had
some
training
sir.
and
that
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
we
think
as
questions
of
fact
that
they
do
just
very
well
here
also.
but
when
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
a
sophisticated
question
of
law,
then
it’s
very
unlikely
that
the
jp
is
going
to
understand,
what
you’re
talking
about.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
it’s
very
possible.
it
would
discriminate
against
either
party.
what
we
suggest
is
that,
what
i
would
like
to
see
in
replacing
this
is
perhaps
a
single
bond,
but
a
method
whereby
questions
of
law
could
be
presented
to
a
system
of
certification.
so
that
the
question
of
law
could
be
presented
to
the
learned
judge,
then
you
wouldn’t
have
any
discrimination
at
all.
you
wouldn’t
have
any
complaints.
you
wouldn’t
have
any
complaints
about
a
jp
about
not
being
learned,
because
if
you
have
a
sophisticated
question
in
law,
then
you
can
present
it
to
the
jp
in
a
single
bond
would
not
discriminate
against
anybody.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
we’re
not
asking
for
the
maximum.
we’re
not
asking
for
the
most
learned
judge,
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
we’re
not
even
asking
for
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
is
learned.
that
is
one
alternative.
like
state
of
pennsylvania
has
trained
their
justices
of
the
peace.
that’s
an
expensive
proposition,
but
if
you
have
a
sophisticated
question
of
law
arises,
there
can
be
an
alternative
method.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that
could
be
raised
by
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
that
could
be
raised
on
motion
of
any
in
the
parties
--
or
any
of
the
justice
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i
think
here
--
i
think
we
have
a
situation
right
here
where
it’s
a
relative
sophisticated
question
of
law.
whether
or
not
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
your
honor,
any
question
of
law
that
there
is
a
feeling
on
any
party
that
the
jp
does
not
understand
it,
then
if
you
certify
that
question,
then
you
would
do
away.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
either
party,
either
party
the
plaintiff,
or
the
defendant,
or
the
justice
of
peace.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
your
honor
--
if
it
is
just
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
again,
your
honor,
there
are
sanctions.
there
could
be
sanctions
for
a
thing
like
that.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
if
you’re
wasting
the
court’s
time,
if
you’re
wasting
a
court
of
reference.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
do
i
want
to
change?
no,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
am
not
asking
for
any
type
of
legislation.
what
i’m
saying
is,
if
you
have
a
single
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that
of
course
is
the
legislature
of
west
virginia,
but
if
the
double
bond
does
not
stand,
and
if
the
single
bond
is
replaced,
it
would
be
very
simple.
you’re
still
going
to
always
have
the
complaint
that
jp
doesn’t
understand
what
we’re
talking
about.
that’s
the
easy
way
out
of
that.
it’s
just
to
provide
a
system
of
certification
so
that
when
a
party
feels
that
his
question
of
law
is
not
been
properly
handled,
he
can
go.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i’m
not
asking
for
that.
all
we’re
saying
is
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i’m
suggesting
your
honor,
that
there
are
less
restrictive
alternatives
in
posting
a
double
bond.
that’s
all
i’m
suggesting.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
again
you’re
going
to
have
that
gray
area.
this
is
what
was
recognized
in
the
lindsey
decision.
there
are
going
to
be
some
people
who
can
not
post
that
bond
that
can
not
post
that
single
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
but
there
are
going
to
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
your
honor,
if
quite
frankly,
i
think
if
the
double
bond
is
struck
down
and
the
only
bond
left
is
a
single
bond,
if
he
can’t
post
that,
and
it’s
our
hope
that
ultimately
that
we
can
persuade
the
legislature
that
when
you
have
sophisticated
questions
of
law,
there
should
be
a
method
of
certifying
questions
of
law
to
the
court
of
record.
that
would
be
the
simple
way
out.
i’m
not
saying
that
every
case
that
you’re
going
to
have
sophisticated
questions
of
law
that
need
--
a
jp
can
find
fact
just
as
well
as
a
judge
can.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
not
likely,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
your
honor,
what
we’re
posing
here
is
the
difference
in
treatment
between
a
court
of
record
appellant
and
you
know,
i
can’t
conjecture
to
make
a
hypothesis
that
he
can
make
double
bond
and
he
can’t
make
a
double
bond
and
he
can’t
make
a
single
bond.
we’re
not
asking
for
you
to
say
that
bonds
--
appeal
bonds
per
se
are
unconstitutional.
what
we’re
suggesting
is
that
a
double
bond
is
discriminatory.
that’s
as
far
as
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
at
the
time
this
case
rose,
he
could
not
make
any
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
we’re
not
asking
you
to
throw
out
all
bonds.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
again
my
suggestion
is
for
state
legislature
in
west
virginia
to
look
for
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
otherwise,
we’re
still
going
to
have
a
justice
of
the
peace
system
with
flaws
in
it.
we’re
still
going
to
have
a
judge
who
is
looking
at
matters
of
law.
he
is
not
an
expert
in
them
and
as
long
as
that
continues,
there’s
still
going
to
be
unequal
treatment
in
the
west
virginia
jp
system,
yes
sir.
but
that
can
be
eliminated.
there’s
a
less
restrictive
alternative
and
that’s
the
method
of
certification
that
i’m
suggesting.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
for
the
legislature.
i’m
not
asking
this
court
to
do
it.
all
i’m
asking
this
court
is
to
strike
down
a
double
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
you
can’t
appeal
it,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
at
that
point
in
time
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it’s
possible.
we
did
that
in
the
reece
case.
that
was
what
we
did
in
the
reece
case.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
but
this
case
was
brought
before
the
reece
case.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
your
honor,
i
quite
frankly,
can’t
answer
that.
i
didn’t
bring
--
i
didn’t
argue
the
case
before
the
three-judges
below.
i
didn’t
file
the
action.
i
think
it
was
just
a
matter
of
tactics.
you
do
have
a
right
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it’s
possible
to
do
it,
but
again
it’s
a
question
of
discretion.
when
we
went
in
on
reece,
we
went
in
to
that
court
on
a
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
let
me
put
it
this
way
your
honor,
maybe
i
can
explain
it
better.
reece
was
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
we
couldn’t
get
up
to
the
appellate
system
in
west
virginia,
because
the
only
way
we
can
get
up
there
is
on
original
jurisdiction.
we
went
out
on
a
prohibition,
and
asked
them
to
prohibit
the
enforcement
of
the
state
statute.
they
don’t
have
to
give
us
a
hearing
on
that.
in
the
reece
case,
it
just
so
happens
that
they
did,
because
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
there
was
any
objection
whatsoever.
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
from
state
of
west
virginia.
it
was
a
three-judge
federal
court
below
that
held
a
state
statute
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
as
being
constitutional.
that
statute
provides
that
one
who
seeks
to
appeal
from
a
hearing
and
a
judgment
or
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
state
of
west
virginia,
it
required
to
posts
a
double
bond,
a
bond
twice
the
amount
of
the
judgment.
we
challenge
that
as
unconstitutional
denying
equal
protection
and
due
process
of
law.
before
i
begin
with
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
subject
of
mootness.
we
have
made
the
unusual
move
perhaps
for
an
appellant
whose
bringing
the
case
before
the
court,
of
suggesting
that
our
case
may
be
moot.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
am
not
arguing
for
mootness.
i
am
fulfilling
what
i
believe
is
my
duty
to
the
court,
and
informing
the
court
of
all
the
issues
and
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
that
there
was
a
case
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
that
went
to
the
state
supreme
court
in
west
virginia
that
was
virtually
identical,
practically
it’s
not
much
different.
that
case
raised
same
issues
as
are
presented
here.
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
declared
the
judgment
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
in
that
case
void.
another
case,
an
older
case
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
said
that
when
you
have
a
pecuniary
interest
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
his
judgment,
then
the
judgment
is
void
ab
initio,
that
was
in
a
criminal
context.
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
reece
case,
this
is
the
name
of
the
case,
reece
v.
geis
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
since
the
three-judge
court,
yes
sir.
it’s
just
very
recent,
1972.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
reece,
r-e-e-c-e
versus
geis,
g-e-i-s.
i’ve
cited
it
in
my
motion
or
suggestion
of
mootness,
the
--
it’
198
s.e.
2d.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
198
s.e.
2d,
i
am
not
sure
what
page
it
is
sir.
it
is
in
the
record,
i
have
cited
it
in
the
motion.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
there’s
been
no
change
in
the
statute
at
all.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
think
the
conclusion
would
be
the
same.
we
have
a
decision
by
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
and
by
the
three-judge
court
that
the
double
bond
has
a
rational
basis.
getting
back
to
the
mootness
thing,
let
me
refer
to
that
again.
the
effect
of
that
case
was,
it
said
that
the
judgment
was
but
moot.
the
judgment
was
void.
that
restored
the
status
quo
of
the
parties.
in
other
words,
that
judgment
of
the
jp
was
void,
but
it
wasn’t
the
underlying
claim
that
was
void.
therefore,
the
creditor
could
go
right
back
in
the
same
jp
court,
and
again
sue
the
same
debtor,
the
same
situation
applies
here
and
for
those
reasons
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
as
a
practical
matter
now,
that’s
what
they’re
supposed
to
do.
as
a
practical
now
even
though
they
haven’t
done
and
the
jp
waives
the
collection
of
appease
that
may
have
been
perceived
otherwise.
[voice
overlap]
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
the
one
that
the
reece
court
found
wasn't
affirmed.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes
sir,
exactly.
$2.50
for
execution
$0.35
for
mailing
it.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
they
said
that
was
why
it
was
void,
but
practically
speaking
and
i
think
this
is
the
key
to
that
thing.
the
reece
court
declared
the
judgment
void
below.
now
there’s
been
no
rush
by
creditors
or
jp’s
or
like
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
to
suddenly
come
around
and
say,
“that
statute
was
void,
we’re
going
to
return
all
of
the
moneys
that
we
have
collected
through
the
years.”
therefore,
it’s
not
a
retroactive
application.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
he
hasn’t
executed
yet,
your
honor.
he
did
not
execute
it,
at
that
--
we
sought
to
appeal,
sought
to
post
the
bond
and
so
on,
we
could
not
post
the
bond
and
that’s
what
gave
rise
to
this
case,
went
in
to
federal
court
and
joined
it,
and
so
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
there
again
it
adds
the
question
of
retroactivity,
and
i
don’t
know
what
the
three-judge
court,
i
mean
a
west
virginia
court
would
do.
they
would
have
to
decide
whether
reece
was
retroactive,
and
if
they
decided
reece
was
retroactive,
that
means
everybody,
all
through
the
years
would
have
to
return
their
moneys.
i
would
hope
to
get
attorney’s
fees
if
i
could
get
something
like
that,
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
very
likely.
but
i
think
the
more
important
thing
is
here,
is
its
fact
that
the
creditor
couldn’t
go
back
in
to
the
jp
court,
and
considering
the
cases
on
mootness,
if
this
court
has
decided,
if
there’s
a
likelihood
of
repetition
of
the
conduct
that
complained
them,
then
the
case
is
not
moot,
and
there’s
a
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
creditor
would
do
that,
because
it
is
cheaper
for
him
to
go
to
a
jp
court.
he’s
gone
to
the
same
jp
before,
and
won.
there’s
a
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
win
again,
and
he
doesn’t
have
to
have
an
attorney
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
i
don’t
think
it’s
just
election
cases.
the
general
rule
that
i
understand
mootness
is
that
there
must
be
a
controversy
at
all
stages
of
the
litigation.
in
the
w.t.
grant
case,
u.s.
versus
w.t.
grant
that
was
a
case
where
they
had
the
interlocutory
directorship
and
the
director
says,
they
sought
an
injunction
against
him
and
he
says,
“i’ve
dropped
my
directorship,
so
there’s
no
longer
an
interlocking
situation.”
that
is
only
one
factor
to
be
considered,
that
he
said
that
he
would
drop
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
think
that
was
a
mootness
case.
that
was
a
mootness
case,
yes
sir,
and
he
said
that
the
fact
that
it
may
just
like
the
judgment
here.
it’s
void.
he’s
not
doing
what
was
complained
of,
but
it’s
very
likely
to
come
up
again.
the
act
could
repeat
itself.
another
case
that
i
would
rely
upon
is
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
sir,
i’m
sorry?
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
it
didn’t
consider
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
they
considered
the
second
half
of
the
statute.
the
second
half
of
this
statute
is
a
double
bond
also
in
eviction
cases
plus
one
year
rent.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
they
did
not
have
this
part
of
the
statute
beforehand.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i
don’t
think
it
is.
i’m
not
arguing
for
mootness
sir.
i’m
just
saying
that
there
may
be
a
question
of
mootness.
it’s
not
my
function
to
decide
whether
it’s
moot
or
not,
by
avoiding
the
issue.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
raise
it.
i
think
that
it
was
--
he
did
not
do
it,
then
i
thought
that
it
was
my
function
to
do
it,
so
i
did
raise
it.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
10
years
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
--
in
west
virginia
so
he
can
go
right
back
there
and
sue
them
again.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
it
has
not.
what
he’s
doing
is
suing
on
the
note,
and
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
keys
to
this
case.
there
is
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
jp’s
court
with
a
court
of
record,
and
i
think
that
gives
rise
to
our
equal
protection
argument
here,
which
i
would
like
to
turn
to
now
if
the
court
has
no
more
further
questions
on
mootness.
we
have
painted
a
picture
of
the
jp
system
in
west
virginia,
words
and
all,
we
pointed
out
a
lot
of
flaws
in
it.
the
reece
case
bares
us
out
on
one
of
the
flaws
that
the
jp
has
an
interest
in
the
judgment.
we’ve
also
pointed
out
that
a
jp
is
not
an
expert
in
law.
he
is
not
a
learned
judge.
he’s
not
required
to
be
an
attorney
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
your
honor,
what
i
am
doing
is
--
what
i
am
suggesting
is
when
you
focus
upon
the
double
bond,
to
whether
it
is
constitutional
or
unconstitutional,
to
look
at
the
entire
system.
we’re
saying
that
the
double
bond
is
unconstitutional,
because
we
have
very
compelling
reasons
to
want
to
get
into
a
court
of
record.
when
we
have
raised
a
question
of
law,
and
i
think
it’s
pretty
well
indicated
in
the
record
here,
we
said
that
we
had
a
substantive
defense
under
the
ucc,
and
the
creditor’s
attorney
when
he
answered
the
complaint
in
this
action
said,
“we
admit
it.
this
is
not
a
case
of
obstruction.
you
really
do
have
a
good
question
of
law.”
i
think
that’s
very
significant.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
single
bond
and
that
raises
first
two
classes.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
judgment
plus
interest,
so
far
that’s
the
way
the
statute
reads.
there’s
no
damages
for
the
delay
demanded
on
a
single
bond.
the
statute
which
covers
that
is
west
virginia
code
58514,
which
would
indicate
that
in
a
court
of
record,
only
a
single
bond
would
be
required
that
would
be
on
the
judgment
and
perhaps
on
the
interest
of
6%
that
can
be
awarded
to
the
appellant
if
he
ultimately
loses.
so
what
the
court
of
record
appellant
must
post,
that
he
must
post
a
bond
like
a
jp
appellant
post,
he
would
post
a
bond
in
the
amount
of
$318.00
or
posing
$300.00
judgments
in
two
different
systems.
he
would
post
a
bond
of
$318.00,
whereas,
the
jp
appellant
must
post
a
bond
of
$600.00.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
not
in
the
court
of
record
system.
however,
there
is
a
provision
for
cost
in
the
jp
system.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that’s
one
of
the
things
brought
out
by
reece.
they
said
it
had
a
rational
basis,
because
the
double
bond
was
for
the
judgment,
plus
cost,
plus
interest
and
as
appellee
points
out
and
that
as
is
provided
in
our
state
statutes
you
are
entitled
to
damages
for
delay.
when
you
add
these
up
mathematically,
and
this
is
something
i
think
is
very
important.
just
the
simple
mathematics
indicates
that
there
is
not
a
rational
basis
for
a
double
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i
don’t
know,
your
honor
that
seems
to
me
to
be
interesting.
let
me
point
it
out
to
you
exactly.
you
are
entitled
to
in
the
jp
system
the
bond
under
the
reece
decision
would
be
to
cover
the
judgment
which
would
be
$300.00,
6%
interest
that
adds
up
to
$318.00
total,
or
no
6%
on
$300
is
18
more
dollars,
so
you
have
$318.00.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
and
you
have
court
cost
to
appeal
the
cost
to
go
from
jp
court
to
a
court
of
record
is
$10.00.
then
you’re
entitled
on
that
10%
on
the
cost,
the
judgment,
the
interest
of
6%,
and
the
court
cost
of
$10,
you
are
entitled
to
10%
damages
for
delay
on
that.
that
adds
up
to
a
maximum
judgment
would
ever
be
rendered
against
a
appellant
from
a
jp
system.
if
he
loses,
it’s
$360.80.
now,
if
you
are
posting
a
bond
of
$600.00,
there
is
$290.00
left
that
has
not
been
articulated
as
i
don’t
know
what
it’s
for.
there
is
no
articulated
state
standard
for
why
$293.00
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
$318.00
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
all
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
we
say
it
denies
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it’s
in
our
equal
protections
argument
your
honor,
it
is
part
3.
are
you
referring
to
the
brief
itself?
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
it’s
in
part
3
(a).
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
argument
is
3
(a)
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
generally
i
am
not
an
expert
on
that
your
honor.
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
any
longer
than
a
year.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
but
generally,
practically
speaking
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
the
state
cases
have
indicated
that
generally,
your
bond
from
a
court
of
record
to
go
to
the
highest
court
in
the
state,
we
only
have
one
step
appellate
system,
is
only
an
amount
of
the
judgment,
plus
the
interest
of
one
year.
yes,
sir,
that
practically
speaking
is
what
is
done.
there’s
not
many
cases
on
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
the
judge
below.
whoever
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it’s
up
to
the
judge
to
decide
what
it’s
going
to
be.
but
practically
speaking,
it’s
the
judgment
plus
one
year’s
interest,
but
here
we
have
two
years.
we
also
suggest
that
the
difference
in
treatment
in
the
jp
system,
in
the
court
of
record
system
goes
much
farther.
and
we
also
argue
that
the
compelling
state
interest
test
should
be
applied
here,
not
just
the
rational
basis
test.
we
have
tried
to
paint
the
picture
of
a
non
expert
deciding
questions
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
but
if
you
decide,
we
made
the
same
argument
to
the
west
virginia
supreme
court,
and
they
decided
it
had
a
rational
basis.
you
could
do
the
same
thing.
so
i
would
prefer
to
argue
my
entire
case
to
play
it
safe.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
what
we
try
to
present
is
that
there
is
a
difference
in
treatment
all
through
the
court
of
record
system
and
the
jp
system.
we
have
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
they
didn’t
your
honor,
they
said
that
the
bond
protects
the
judgment
cost
and
interest,
and
that’s
as
far
as
they
went
in
the
reece
case.
that’s
the
most
recent
definition
of
why
you
required
a
double
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it
did,
but
they
just
said
that
it
has
a
rational
basis,
because
a
double
bond
protects
a
judgment,
cost,
and
interest.
now,
where
they
came
mathematically,
i
don’t
see
that
it
does,
but
that’s
what
they
said.
so
that’s
the
close
latest
definition
of
what
the
bonds
function
is.
they
have
defined
the
function
of
that
double
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
reece
versus
geis.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
the
recent
one
--
yes,
sir
and
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
i
was.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i
think
twice,
$18.00.
i
think
that
is
probably
very
close
to
what
lindsey,
very
close
to
the
lindsey
analogy
in
this
case.
in
lindsey,
you
had
a
double
bond
also,
so
if
you
had
to
put
up
assured,
you
would
probably
have
not
that
greater
difference,
but
if
you
go
all
the
way
down
the
line
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
winner
take
all,
we
don’t
have
a
winner
take
all
situation
here,
but
if
you
follow
the
mathematics
of
it
all
the
way
down
the
line,
you
figure
out
that
the
state
objectives
of
protecting
the
interests
and
10%
damages
for
delay,
and
so
on,
which
you
wind
up
with
is
ultimately,
maybe
not
a
winner
take
all
situation,
but
if
the
appellant
in
the
jp
system
loses,
he
loses
$60.00
more
than
does
an
appellant
in
a
court
of
record
system.
it’s
going
to
cost
him
$60.00
more
than
it
will
cost
a
court
of
record
appellant,
if
he
loses,
and
i
don’t
see
if
that’s
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
not
just
premium,
sir.
we’re
talking
about
the
state’s
objectives
also
deny
equal
protection
law.
as
the
way
they
have
spelled
it
out
as
a
result
of
the
reece
case,
you’re
paying
interest
twice,
you’re
paying
twice
the
premium,
and
that
adds
up
to
$60.00
more
than
the
court
of
record
appellant
pays.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
but
we’re
posing
here
an
indigent.
we’re
posing
an
indigent,
that’s
a
frame
of
reference.
we
have
an
indigent
who
can
not
post
the
bond
in
jp
system.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
not
quite.
this
is
where
our
argument
comes
to
as
lindsey
recognized,
there
is
this
gray
area,
and
there’s
going
to
be
some
people
who
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
post
that
bond.
we
agree.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
overturn
arnold
versus
union
national.
we’re
asking
only
for
a
single
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
alright,
let
me
take
it
again.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
well
it
was
stipulated.
it
was
found
as
a
matter
by
the
court
below
that
it
would
be
6%
surety.
so,
that’s
what
it
would
cost
on
the
bond.
let
me
go
through
the
mathematics
again
for
you.
in
the
jp
system,
we
have
a
judgment
of
$300.00,
interest
to
be
charged
on
that,
that’s
under
code
4765
is
6%.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
sir?
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
this
is
statutory.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
one
year’s
interest.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
in
the
court
of
record
system.
i’m
just
talking
about
the
jp
system
now.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
that’s
possible,
but
that’s
not
the
way
the
statute
was
set
up.
if
you
look
at
the
second
half
of
that
statute,
and
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
to
construe
them
together.
the
second
half
of
the
statute
is
also
an
appeal
statute,
double
bond
to
appeal
an
eviction
plus
one
year’s
rent.
that
means
that
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
this
was
what
was
anticipated
by
the
legislature
that
it
would
only
take
one
year
to
appeal
a
decision
of
a
jp.
it
would
not
take
any
longer
than
one
year.
in
addition
to
which,
we
have
a
two-term
rule
in
the
state
of
west
virginia.
that
is,
if
you
appeal
from
a
jp
to
a
court
of
record,
you’ve
got
to
bring
that
on
for
hearing
within
two
terms
of
court.
that’s
within
one
year.
so
when
you
take
it
in
that
frame
of
reference,
it’s
not
going
to
be
any
longer
than
one
year.
when
you
look
at
the
statute
itself,
the
second
half
of
the
statute,
which
refers
to
one
year’s
rent
in
an
eviction
situation,
plus
the
two-term
rule,
then
it’s
very
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
interest
will
not
be
more
than
one
year.
i
would
like
to
return
again
to
the
compelling
state
interest
argument
that
we
have.
we
suggest
that
there’s
not
equal
treatment
in
the
two
systems,
in
the
court
of
record
system
or
in
the
justice
peace
system.
you
have
a
bias,
which
is
built
into
the
law.
the
reece
case
bares
us
out
on
that
argument.
you
do
have
an
admitted
jp
based
with
a
question
of
law
and
he
is
not
an
expert
in
it.
we
have
in
the
same
situation,
a
person
who
has
the
money
can
afford
to
go
into
a
court
of
record,
he
can
post
that
bond.
whereas,
an
indigent
cannot
post
a
bond.
i
realize
this
raises
the
question
of
wealth
classification,
and
this
court
is
not
seem
fit
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
compelling
state
interest
standard
applies
to
wealth
classification.
but
what
i’m
suggesting
is,
it’s
just
not
the
wealth
classification
and
there
is
something
more
here
than
the
wealth
classification.
that
is
the
unequal
treatment
in
the
two
court
systems.
when
you
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
creditor
could
have
gone
into
either
one
of
those
courts,
it’s
his
choice.
he
could
go
into
either
court
of
record
system
where
my
client
would’ve
had
a
learned
judge
who
is
not
biased.
he
had
--
no
fees
were
going
to
be
accrued
to
him.
then
the
compelling
state
interest
state
standard
applies
here.
and
it’s
--
the
burden
of
course
then
of
the
state
to
show
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
for
the
discrimination
on
the
bond.
we
also
suggest
that
this
is
like
the
boddie
case.
i’m
not
saying
that
this
is
a
boddie
case.
we’re
not
saying
that
the
contract
creates
a
fundamental
interest.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
equal
treatment
in
the
court
is
a
fundamental
interest,
like
the
fundamental
interest
found
in
boddie.
boddie
stands
alone
that’s
clear
from
kras
and
ortwein
decision.
we’re
not
saying
that
the
contract
equals
marriage.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
the
right
to
be
heard
and
to
be
treated
equally
within
a
court
system.
equal
treatment
within
a
court
system
is
a
matter
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
you
can
appear
on
your
own
in
the
court
of
record.
one
of
our
arguments,
of
course
is
that
if
you
have
a
lawyer
who
is
trying
to
argue
matters
of
law
before
a
jp
that
more
than
likely
he
is
not
going
to
know
what
you
are
talking
about?
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
if
judges
usually
would
have
had
some
training
sir.
and
that
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
we
think
as
questions
of
fact
that
they
do
just
very
well
here
also.
but
when
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
a
sophisticated
question
of
law,
then
it’s
very
unlikely
that
the
jp
is
going
to
understand,
what
you’re
talking
about.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
it’s
very
possible.
it
would
discriminate
against
either
party.
what
we
suggest
is
that,
what
i
would
like
to
see
in
replacing
this
is
perhaps
a
single
bond,
but
a
method
whereby
questions
of
law
could
be
presented
to
a
system
of
certification.
so
that
the
question
of
law
could
be
presented
to
the
learned
judge,
then
you
wouldn’t
have
any
discrimination
at
all.
you
wouldn’t
have
any
complaints.
you
wouldn’t
have
any
complaints
about
a
jp
about
not
being
learned,
because
if
you
have
a
sophisticated
question
in
law,
then
you
can
present
it
to
the
jp
in
a
single
bond
would
not
discriminate
against
anybody.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
we’re
not
asking
for
the
maximum.
we’re
not
asking
for
the
most
learned
judge,
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
we’re
not
even
asking
for
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
is
learned.
that
is
one
alternative.
like
state
of
pennsylvania
has
trained
their
justices
of
the
peace.
that’s
an
expensive
proposition,
but
if
you
have
a
sophisticated
question
of
law
arises,
there
can
be
an
alternative
method.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that
could
be
raised
by
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
that
could
be
raised
on
motion
of
any
in
the
parties
--
or
any
of
the
justice
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i
think
here
--
i
think
we
have
a
situation
right
here
where
it’s
a
relative
sophisticated
question
of
law.
whether
or
not
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
your
honor,
any
question
of
law
that
there
is
a
feeling
on
any
party
that
the
jp
does
not
understand
it,
then
if
you
certify
that
question,
then
you
would
do
away.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
either
party,
either
party
the
plaintiff,
or
the
defendant,
or
the
justice
of
peace.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
your
honor
--
if
it
is
just
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
again,
your
honor,
there
are
sanctions.
there
could
be
sanctions
for
a
thing
like
that.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
if
you’re
wasting
the
court’s
time,
if
you’re
wasting
a
court
of
reference.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
do
i
want
to
change?
no,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
am
not
asking
for
any
type
of
legislation.
what
i’m
saying
is,
if
you
have
a
single
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that
of
course
is
the
legislature
of
west
virginia,
but
if
the
double
bond
does
not
stand,
and
if
the
single
bond
is
replaced,
it
would
be
very
simple.
you’re
still
going
to
always
have
the
complaint
that
jp
doesn’t
understand
what
we’re
talking
about.
that’s
the
easy
way
out
of
that.
it’s
just
to
provide
a
system
of
certification
so
that
when
a
party
feels
that
his
question
of
law
is
not
been
properly
handled,
he
can
go.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i’m
not
asking
for
that.
all
we’re
saying
is
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
i’m
suggesting
your
honor,
that
there
are
less
restrictive
alternatives
in
posting
a
double
bond.
that’s
all
i’m
suggesting.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
again
you’re
going
to
have
that
gray
area.
this
is
what
was
recognized
in
the
lindsey
decision.
there
are
going
to
be
some
people
who
can
not
post
that
bond
that
can
not
post
that
single
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
but
there
are
going
to
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
your
honor,
if
quite
frankly,
i
think
if
the
double
bond
is
struck
down
and
the
only
bond
left
is
a
single
bond,
if
he
can’t
post
that,
and
it’s
our
hope
that
ultimately
that
we
can
persuade
the
legislature
that
when
you
have
sophisticated
questions
of
law,
there
should
be
a
method
of
certifying
questions
of
law
to
the
court
of
record.
that
would
be
the
simple
way
out.
i’m
not
saying
that
every
case
that
you’re
going
to
have
sophisticated
questions
of
law
that
need
--
a
jp
can
find
fact
just
as
well
as
a
judge
can.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
not
likely,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
your
honor,
what
we’re
posing
here
is
the
difference
in
treatment
between
a
court
of
record
appellant
and
you
know,
i
can’t
conjecture
to
make
a
hypothesis
that
he
can
make
double
bond
and
he
can’t
make
a
double
bond
and
he
can’t
make
a
single
bond.
we’re
not
asking
for
you
to
say
that
bonds
--
appeal
bonds
per
se
are
unconstitutional.
what
we’re
suggesting
is
that
a
double
bond
is
discriminatory.
that’s
as
far
as
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
at
the
time
this
case
rose,
he
could
not
make
any
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
yes,
sir.
we’re
not
asking
you
to
throw
out
all
bonds.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
again
my
suggestion
is
for
state
legislature
in
west
virginia
to
look
for
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
otherwise,
we’re
still
going
to
have
a
justice
of
the
peace
system
with
flaws
in
it.
we’re
still
going
to
have
a
judge
who
is
looking
at
matters
of
law.
he
is
not
an
expert
in
them
and
as
long
as
that
continues,
there’s
still
going
to
be
unequal
treatment
in
the
west
virginia
jp
system,
yes
sir.
but
that
can
be
eliminated.
there’s
a
less
restrictive
alternative
and
that’s
the
method
of
certification
that
i’m
suggesting.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
that’s
for
the
legislature.
i’m
not
asking
this
court
to
do
it.
all
i’m
asking
this
court
is
to
strike
down
a
double
bond.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
you
can’t
appeal
it,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
at
that
point
in
time
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it’s
possible.
we
did
that
in
the
reece
case.
that
was
what
we
did
in
the
reece
case.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
but
this
case
was
brought
before
the
reece
case.
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
well,
your
honor,
i
quite
frankly,
can’t
answer
that.
i
didn’t
bring
--
i
didn’t
argue
the
case
before
the
three-judges
below.
i
didn’t
file
the
action.
i
think
it
was
just
a
matter
of
tactics.
you
do
have
a
right
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
it’s
possible
to
do
it,
but
again
it’s
a
question
of
discretion.
when
we
went
in
on
reece,
we
went
in
to
that
court
on
a
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
let
me
put
it
this
way
your
honor,
maybe
i
can
explain
it
better.
reece
was
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
we
couldn’t
get
up
to
the
appellate
system
in
west
virginia,
because
the
only
way
we
can
get
up
there
is
on
original
jurisdiction.
we
went
out
on
a
prohibition,
and
asked
them
to
prohibit
the
enforcement
of
the
state
statute.
they
don’t
have
to
give
us
a
hearing
on
that.
in
the
reece
case,
it
just
so
happens
that
they
did,
because
--
mr.
george
r.
higinbotham
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
there
was
any
objection
whatsoever.
thank
you.
