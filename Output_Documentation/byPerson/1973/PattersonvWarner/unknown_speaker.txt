unknown
speaker
that’s
since
the
judgment
below?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
spelling?
unknown
speaker
has
the
statute
been
--
unknown
speaker
has
the
statute
since
been
amended?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
this
suggest
that
perhaps
if
three-judge
court
committed
to
address
the
significance
of
this
recent
decision,
perhaps
it
would
not
have
reached
the
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
but
then,
what
would
happen
to
the
guys,
would
the
jp
have
to
disqualify
himself
or
something?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
infirmity
in
his
judgment,
that
he
was
receiving
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
--
that
he
received
a
financial
benefit
if
he
decided
to
pay
for
the
plaintiff
that
was
settlement?
unknown
speaker
which
he
didn’t
get
if
he
decided
to
pay
for
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
well
the
most
that
could
happen
here,
if
i
understand
you
correctly
is,
this
jp
collected
the
$2.50,
i
get?
unknown
speaker
does
respondent,
the
appellee
raise
this?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
problem
of
the
statute
of
limitations
having
run
if
the
creditor
has
to
bring
them
out?
unknown
speaker
10
years?
unknown
speaker
has
this
note
been
paid
off
yet?
unknown
speaker
is
the
action
that's
been
instituted
in
some
court
of
record
under
your
practice?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
rely
on
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
no
provision
for
costs?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
from
the
court,
from
the
record,
do
i
understand
you
say
that
the
bond
would
be
what,
only
the
$380.00?
unknown
speaker
$318,
unknown
speaker
judgment
and
the
interest.
now,
and
are
you
challenging
the
jp
bond
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
independently
of
any
other
ground,
on
the
ground
that
that’s
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
to
require
you
to
do
that
jp,
but
not
from
a
court
of
record.
unknown
speaker
which
of
your
points
of
the
seven
points
presents
that
question?
unknown
speaker
i
am
looking
at
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
am
looking
at
the
question
presented
at
five.
3
(a)?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
who
fixes
one
year’s
interest?
is
that
on
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
up
to
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
that
you
prevail
on
this
distinction
between
bonds
--
jp
bonds
and
court
of
record
bonds.
we
don’t
have
to
reach
anything
else,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
rational
basis
that
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
found?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
said
that
you’d
presented
this
whole
argument
to
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia,
and
that
court
found
that
this
has
a
rational
basis?
unknown
speaker
and
in
what
case
did
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
in
reece?
unknown
speaker
were
you
a
counsel
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
it
can
amount
too
much.
can
a
commercial
bond,
what’s
the
difference
in
the
premium
between
$318.00
and
the
$600.00?
unknown
speaker
lindsey
involved
in
double
bond
that
is
automatically
[voice
overlap].
unknown
speaker
on
that
basis,
you
make
the
same
argument
for
a
single
bond,
true?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
these
premium
figures
that
you
so
glibly
throw
around.
where
do
you
get
that
$60.00?
unknown
speaker
after
all,
we
don’t
know
west
virginia
premium
rates.
unknown
speaker
your
client
is
a
pauper,
is
he
not?
unknown
speaker
then
how
can
he
pay
for
even
a
single
bond?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
that
even
--
unknown
speaker
--
help
your
client
at
all?
i
mean
--
unknown
speaker
one
of
your
complaints
is
this
double
bond
particularly
when
compared
to
an
appeal
from
the
court
of
record,
which
is
a
single
bond
plus
one
year’s
interest
generally
set
by
the
trial
judge
that
you
told
us.
but
if
we
declare
that
violation
of
equal
protection
clause,
your
client
couldn’t
appeal
anyway,
could
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
hardly
even
have
a
stand
to
make
that
complaint
if
your
client
couldn’t
appeal
anyway?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
discriminating
as
your
client,
because
he
can’t
make
any
bond,
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
if
he
filed
an
affidavit,
of
--
unknown
speaker
--
i
think,
didn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that’s
the
only
thing
it
would
help
your
client,
the
only
thing
that
would
enable
your
client
to
appeal,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
i
think
you’ve
told
us
is
for
the
west
virginia
legislature.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn’t
you
have
presented
this
issue
to
the
west
virginia
court
rather
than
coming
to
the
federal
court?
once
you
had
a
case
going
in
the
west
virginia
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
if
it
were
found
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
suppose
you
could
appeal
it.
if
the
west
virginia
courts
have
agreed
with
you
that
denying
an
appeal
because
if
there’s
a
file
of
bond
was
unconstitutional,
that
would’ve
ended
up
being
an
appeal.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
thought
--
unknown
speaker
probably
the
federal
district
court,
instead
of
taking
your
issue
up
to
the
state
system.
unknown
speaker
if
younger
against
harris
applies
to
civil
actions,
why
shouldn’t
you
have
presented
your
constitution
issue
inside
the
state
system?
unknown
speaker
in
addition
of
question
of
discretion
if
the
principles
of
younger
against
harris
apply
to
pending
civil
cases
--
unknown
speaker
did
they
object
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
really
i
suppose
what
you’re
saying
is
that
geis
been
decided
when
the
three-judge
court
got
this
case.
the
three-judge
court
would
have
determined
then
and
there
that
the
judgment
was
void.
there
was
no
case
in
that
–
unknown
speaker
and
now
you
say
if
we
give
it
to
the
three-judge
court
now,
they’ll
apply
geis.
unknown
speaker
all
the
underlying
judgment,
void
and
dismiss
the
suit.
unknown
speaker
and
how
much
is
it
usually?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
so
would
i.[laughter

unknown
speaker
that’s
since
the
judgment
below?
unknown
speaker
what’s
