justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
court
find
the
statute
unconstitutional
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
find
this
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
the
one
point
that’s
involved
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
did
know
of
the
statute
that
we
had
before
as
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
that
be
moot
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
make
the
same
point
if
the
judges
of
the
peace
had
been
member
of
the
bar
for
six
months,
and
the
judge
on
the
trial
court
had
been
a
judge
for
40
years.
would
you
say
that
the
jp
had
to
have
40
years
experience
of
judging?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
trying
to
get,
what
kind
of
justice
of
peace
do
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
would
decide
what
is
a
“sophisticated
point
of
law”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
underscored
sophisticated.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
can
we
--
what
is
the
sophisticated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
you’re
relatively
sophisticated.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
does
the
certifying,
you
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
had
you
ever
had
a
client
who
didn’t
think
his
case
was
sophisticated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
absolutely
important
in
life
and
death,
have
you
got
any
clients
who
don’t
think
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
want
to
change
the
whole
system,
don’t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
you
enlist
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
do
this
without
legislation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
we
make
the
state
of
west
virginia
adopt
such
a
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
certainly
are,
because
they
do
now
have
a
law
that
says
“no”
to
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
haven’t
filed
a
suggestion
of
mootness,
have
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
the
usual
procedure
before
you
argue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
a
normal
procedure
is
that
you
file
a
suggestion
of
mootness.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
you
change
your
mind,
just
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
everybody
that’s
had
a
judgment
against
them
with
the
jp
court
from
1900
to
date
is
entitled
to
get
his
money
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
i’m
seeing
again
25
and
300?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
see
any
difference
between
$25.00
and
$300.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood
his
complaint
was
that
it
cost
him
$318.00
or
$600.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
rule
of
appeal
from
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
to
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia,
how
much
is
the
bond
at
the
previous
bond?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
then,
there
is
still
a
difference
between
the
two?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
here
we
have
$300.00.
this
case
is
$300.00,
it’s
not
$15.00,
its
$300.00
involved
to
protect
$28.00,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
higher
court
can
assess
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that
the
cost
was
$10.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
adds
up
to
how
much?
less
than
$300.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you’re
not
really
arguing
that
the
double
bond
is
to
protect
anybody
other
than
whom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
plaintiff
can’t
get
that
$300.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
not
going
to
change
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
purpose
of
the
$300.00
is
to
prevent
people
from
appealing
or
discourage
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
other
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
state
of
west
virginia
isn’t
making
a
living
on
this,
i
hope.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
use
of
the
$300.00
will
consider
at
the
time
the
case
is
spent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
assess
that
$2.50
though,
doesn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
court
find
the
statute
unconstitutional
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
find
this
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
the
one
point
that’s

justice
thurgood
