mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
civil
rights
litigation
comes
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it
follows
a
reversal
in
part
and
an
affirmance
in
part
of
an
opinion
and
an
injunction
issued
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
and
although
only
two
rather
narrow
issues
remain
for
consideration
by
this
court,
the
litigation
started
out
as
a
rather
complex
set
of
suits
and
motions
which
reigned
at
solving
a
problem
of
resegregation
of
public
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery,
alabama.
prior
to
1959,
all
public
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery
were
segregated
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
city
ordinance.
in
1959,
the
district
court
of
the
middle
district
in
the
initial
gilmore
case,
the
first
stage
of
this
case,
entered
an
order
requiring
desegregation
of
all
public
recreational
facilities.
now,
the
city’s
response
to
this
order
was
to
close
all
of
the
parks,
all
of
the
recreational
facilities
in
the
city.
at
about
that
same
time,
1958-1959,
the
city
first
began
to
cooperate
with
the
local
private
segregated
ymca
by
entering
into
a
coordination
agreement,
turning
over
many
public
recreational
programs
to
the
ymca.
other
changes
throughout
the
60's
and
in
the
early
70's
in
the
recreational
programs
of
the
city
brought
about
a
situation
which
the
original
gilmore
plaintiffs
sought
to
correct.
the
desegregation
of
recreational
facilities
ordered
in
1959
had
been
effectively
negated,
in
our
opinion,
by
increasing
resegregation
throughout
the
decade
of
the
60's.
there
were
three
interrelated
suits
and
motions
which
were
filed
in
order
to
try
and
do
what
could
be
done
to
undo
what
we
term
“resegregation.”
first,
in
1970
the
district
court,
in
response
to
a
complaint
filed
against
the
private
ymca,
found
that
defendant
to
be
conducting
in
concert
with
the
city
extensive
segregated
recreational
programs.
the
court
determined
the
ymca
was
inseparable
from
the
city
itself
and
ordered
desegregation
of
the
ymca.
second,
in
1970,
the
present
petitioners,
in
another
aspect
of
the
gilmore
case,
reopened
gilmore
alleging
vast
inequalities
in
the
provision
of
public
recreational
facilities
to
blacks
in
the
community
when
compared
to
what
whites
received.
after
one
day
of
trial
at
which
the
court
made
a
preliminary
finding
that,
petitioners,
plaintiffs
then,
had
made
a
strong
case
or
a
strong
showing
of
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
city
entered
into
an
agreement
which
if
followed
would
significantly
and
vastly
improve
recreational
facilities
in
black
neighborhoods
in
montgomery.
third
and
finally,
in
1972,
the
district
court
entered
the
injunction,
the
order
and
opinion
which
really
forms
the
basis
of
this
particular
stage
of
the
litigation.
there,
the
district
court
said
and
actually
issued
a
two-pronged
injunction,
enjoining
the
city
from
authorizing
private
segregated
school
use
of
public
recreational
facilities
and
also
enjoining
that
same
use
by
private
segregated
non-school
clubs
and
organizations.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
segregated
school
aspect
of
the
case
only
insofar
as
the
use
by
the
school
proved
to
be
what
the
fifth
circuit
termed
an
“exclusive
use.”
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
the
exclusive
use
is
entire
issue.
that
is
really
what
is
before
this
court
as
to
schools.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir,
with
the
exception
of
exclusive
use,
they
infer
--
they
affirmed
the
district
court
entirely.
we
consider
exclusive
use
to
be
a
major
problem
in
the
enforcement
of
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
going
to
a
park
or
going
to
a
zoo
is
recreational
activity
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
for
example,
i
think
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
agreement
that
was
actually
entered
into
between
the
city
and
the
ymca
in
19
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
believe
it's
a
very
serious
issue
and
i
think
if
you
would
look
at
the
agreement
that
was
entered
into,
which
is
in
our
reply
brief,
addendum
page
134
(a).
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
this
is
1965
when
this
became
--
submitted
into
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
cannot
because
the
only
issue
that
the
fifth
circuit
spoke
directly
to
was
private
--
it
was
the
private
segregated
school
use
of
football
fields,
and
then
it
said,
“and
similar
uses”
or
something
to
that
effect
so
that
i
don't
know
what
other
uses
would
be
banned,
would
be
forbidden.
presumably
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
we
are
challenging
the
exclusive
use
doctrine
of
the
court
of
appeals.
for
example,
if
you
get
away
from
the
football
field
factual
situation
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it,
what
do
you
do
in
a
situation
where
there
are
six
basketball
courts
available
and
the
private
segregated
academy
is
only
using
one
of
the
courts,
is
that
an
exclusive
use?
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
but
well,
we're
--
what
we're
trying
to
say
is
that
exclusive
use
is
not
a
definition
that
you
can
deal
with
in
this
situation.
what
you
have
to
look
to
is
whether
or
not
your
enhancing
the
program
or
the
curriculum
of
the
private
segregated
academy.
and
whether
the
exclusive
--
the
use
is
exclusive
or
nonexclusive
is
immaterial.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that
is
--
that's
correct,
may
not
exclusively
use
a
public
football
field.
now,
may
not
exclusively
use
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
exclusively.
i
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
presumably,
since
the
fifth
circuit
says
that
exclusive
use
is
the
only
use
that
is
barred.
then,
if
you
could
figure
a
way
to
use
a
portion
of
the
football
field
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
would
think
--
i
am
not
sure
you
have
that
in
the
order.
i
know,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
city
is
not
permitting
that
use.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
possibly
so.
the
question--
what
is
exclusive
use?
you
get
right
back
to
the
problem
of
defining
exclusive
use.
i
might
point
out
that
the
fifth
circuit
itself
runs
up
against
the
problem
because
in
a
portion
of
the
stipulation
of
facts
submitted
to
the
fifth
circuit,
one
of
the
stipulations
was
to
the
effect,
i
do
not
have
it
right
before
me
but
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
--
that
segregated
--
there
was
no
exclusive
use.
we
stipulated
that
there
was
no
exclusive
use
of
these
recreational
facilities
by
private
segregated
academies
and
yet
the
fifth
circuit’s
own
opinion
upholds
the
injunction
against
segregated
academy’s
use
of
these
football
fields.
it's
--
we're
saying
it
is
an
unworkable
definition
and
that
that
is
not
the
issue
that
you
should
look
to.
what
one
has
to
look
to
is
whether
or
not
this
private
segregated
academy’s
program,
curriculum,
whatever
is
being
enhanced
very,
very
much
in
the
vain
of
the
norwood,
of
the
norwood
case.
is
the
program
being
enhanced
in
some
way
by
what
the
city
service
is
being
provided?
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
so,
and
i
believe
your
honor
spoke
to
that
very
kind
of
point
in
the
norwood
case
when
you
discussed
the
difference
between
religious
activity
which
is,
if
i
could
be
so
bold
as
to
say,
considered
generally
to
be
a
good
activity.
it's
not
something
that's
banned
by
the
constitution.
and
the
segregation
is
the
activity
which
is
something
that
is
spoken
directly
to
in
the
thirteen
and
fourteenth
amendments
where,
i
hate
to
use
a
good
and
evil
type
definition,
but
that's
essentially
what
i
think
this
court
was
saying
in
the
norwood
case.
and,
however
now
a
different
situation
might
be
presented
if
the
school,
for
example,
were
a
segregated
catholic
academy.
then,
the
fact
of
its
catholicism
would
have
no
effect
on
the
segregated
aspect
of
the
school.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
absolutely,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
allows
nonexclusive
use
by
private
segregated
academies
of
public
recreational
facilities.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
that
it
is
important
in
this
context
to
make
note
of
the
factual
situation
we
find
in
montgomery,
alabama.
we’re
not
talking
about
any
other
section
of
the
country
or
any
other
part
of
the
country.
we’re
talking
about
a
city
that
has
a
history
of
segregation
and
recreation,
and
i
don’t
want
to
get
off
into
other
public
facilities
because
i
don’t
feel
that
that
this
case
deals
with
other
public
facilities.
it
deals
with
public
recreation
facilities
in
montgomery
and
there’s
a
unique
factual
background
there.
and
i
think
that’s
where
the
equal
protection
violations,
if
any,
and
we
contend
that
they
do,
must
be
viewed
from
that
point
of
view.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
the
issue
there
is
completely
different.
we
believe
that
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
only
if
the
activity
is
school
initiated.
if
individual
citizens
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
would
indeed
be
a
constitutional
violation
in
and
of
itself
to
prohibit
those
children
in
a
non-school
connected
capacity
from
using
public
recreational
facilities.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
or
program
of
the
school.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
is
not
restrict
it
to
schools.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
once
again,
granting
that
a
picnic
is
recreational
in
the
context
of
this
case,
which
i
really
don’t
believe
it
is,
but
let’s
assume
that
it
is,
i
suppose
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
black
muslims
close
their
membership
to
whites
or
do
they
have,
under
the
rule
that
the
district
court
promulgated,
do
they
have
a
policy
of
segregation
in
admissions.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that
is
a
much
better
example
because
they
were
dealing
strictly
with
recreational
activities
that
had
gone
on
in
the
past
in
this
case.
and
in
that
situation,
if
you
can’t
apply
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
segregated
black
groups,
and
i’m
not
at
all
100%
certain
that
you
can,
but
if
you
can,
then
the
black
group
with
the
policy
of
segregation
in
its
admissions
policy
would
be
treated
the
same
as
a
white
group
with
the
policy
of
segregation
because
the
whole
purpose
of
this
series
of
lawsuits
since
1959
has
been
to
desegregate
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery,
alabama.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
the
private
class
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
recognize
that
problem.
i’d
first
like
to
point
out
that
the
court
at
the
same
appendix,
15
(a),
made
a
finding
which
seems
inconsistent
with
that
footnote
that
a
period
--
that
there
was
a
periodic
and
i
quote,
“a
periodic
use
of
recreational
facilities
by
private
clubs.”
now,
there
was
evidence
in
the
--
in
all
of
the
pleadings
which
the
district
court
considered,
that
is,
the
complaint,
the
answer,
the
motion
which
was
a
verified
motion,
there
was
evidence
that
all
private
--
that
no
one
was
excluded,
but
all
private
clubs
and
all
private
organizations
were
indeed
permitted
to
use
these
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
much
to
the
addendum
to
our
reply
brief
deals
with
that
very
problem
and
we
recognize
this
problem.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
think
though
that
submitting
on
a
stipulation
of
facts,
which
we
of
course
did,
and
perhaps
all
of
this
is
the
result
of
an
over
familiarity
by
us
as
lawyers
and
by
the
court
with
this
case
because
there's
been
so
much
litigation
in
the
past
few
years.
but
the
district
court
did
have
before
it,
the
district
court
level,
a
great
deal
of
evidence
in
the
gilmore
case
of
1970.
that
was
the
motion
we
filed
on
behalf
of
petitioners
to
equalize
recreational
facilities
in
the
city
of
montgomery,
both
blacks
as
well
as
whites.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
before
i
get
into
that,
and
i
do
want
to
talk
about
what
was
before
the
court,
that
despite
the
circuit
court’s
contention
that
there
was
in
--
that
there
were
insufficient
facts
and
evidence
it
nevertheless
has
now
affected
a
rule
of
law
which
controls
every
district
court
within
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
sir?
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
it
did.
that’s
my
understanding.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
it
finally
set
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
right
of
association
was
such
an
overwhelming
right
when
compared
to
any
right
that
--
to
any
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
they
reached
the
constitutional
issue
so
we
have
this
--
if
there
was
never
a
fact
in
the
case,
we
still
have
a
rule
of
law
that
exists
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
we
think
needs
correcting.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes
sir,
or
as
the
petitioner's
suggestion
would
be
rather
than
that,
that
perhaps
this
is
a
situation
where
the
district
court
should
have
an
opportunity
to
reexamine
the
factual
situation
on
remand
and
it
might
turn
out
to
be
administratively
burdensome,
and
that
the
district
court
is
going
to
make
findings
of
fact
based
upon
evidence
that
it
did
have
before
it
that
was
not
included
to
the
record
going
to
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that
would
be
an
accurate
statement
of
our
position.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
once
again,
i
don’t
know
that
an
art
gallery
has
ever
been
an
issue
in
any
of
these
recreational
cases.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
think
this,
and
again
this
is
a
little
bit
away
from
the
recreational
area
that
in
my
opinion,
aside
from
this
case
that
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
because
it
is
an
enhancement
of
the
curriculum
of
the
school
and
it
is
a
school-oriented,
school-initiated
program.
it’s
a
vast
benefit
to
the
school.
it
is
certainly
something
that
the
school
should
not
be
permitted
to
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
it’s
a
benefit
to
the
school.
it
enhances
the
school.
it
makes
the
parents
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
we
have
suggested
two
possible
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
we
have
suggested
two
possible
exceptions.
one,
justice
rehnquist
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist
promulgated
in
moose
lodge
case
that
is,
necessities
of
life
and
that
that
was
once
again
mentioned
in
norwood
and
the
other
is
any
bar
that
might
totally
ban
the
existence
of
the
school
within
--
in
the
lines
of
something
--
in
the
lines
on
pierce
versus
society
of
sisters.
those
are
arguably
exceptions
and
streets,
public
sidewalks,
sewage
facilities,
those
all
come
within
it,
i
think,
at
least
the
necessities
of
life
exception
that
we
suggested.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
think
that’s
very
much
like
the
norwood
case
where
you
issue
free
--
where
you
free
--
issue
free
textbooks
to
all
students
in
public
schools,
but
not
free
textbooks
to
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
because
they
were
students
in
private
segregated
schools
and
because
the
permission
to
use
these
facilities
would
enhance
the
school
itself
and
would
be
of
great
benefit
to
it.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
have
specifically
written
to
that
several
times
in
or
at
least
tried
to
in
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
lunch
programs,
i
don’t
see
any
distinction
between
lunch
programs
and
textbooks.
that
may
be
the
most
analogous
situation.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
we’re
getting
far
afield
from
recreational
facilities,
but
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
could
not
draw
a
distinction.
i
could
not
draw
a
distinction
between
the
milk
situation
and
the
textbook
situation.
that’s
available
from
another
source.
you
can
buy
milk
from
another
source.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
might
well
come
be
under
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
only
two
further
points
that
i’d
like
to
make
with
respect
to
this
case.
we
have
provided
the
court
with
an
addendum
to
petitioners’
reply
brief
which
is
some
152
pages
in
length.
now,
all
of
this
evidence
found
in
this
addendum
was
introduced
in
judge
johnson’s
court
in
the
district
court
in
the
1970
phase
of
the
gilmore
case.
that’s
the
phase
that
dealt
with
equalization
of
public
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery.
this
present
litigation,
that
is
this
motion
for
supplemental
relief
in
the
gilmore
case,
was
initiated
less
than
eight
months
after
the
order
of
the
court
approving
the
agreement
between
the
petitioners
and
the
city
in
that
gilmore
case.
these
facts
are
material
because
they
were
before
judge
johnson
by
virtue
of
his
authority
to
take
judicial
notice
of
his
own
court
records,
and
because
the
testimony
therein
would
have
clearly
supported
the
injunction
with
respect
to
private
segregated
clubs
and
organizations
used
of
public
recreational
facilities.
i
think
the
keyword
in
examining
these
facts
is
“shift.”
there
was
a
shift
of
white
recreational
programs
which
were
formally
in
the
province
solely
of
the
city
and
the
recreation
department
to
private
clubs
and
organizations.
so
the
city
maintained
control
only
over
the
black
recreational
programs.
now
mayor
james
himself,
at
the
addendum
page
19
(a),
who
was
the
mayor
at
the
time
that
all
these
went
on,
admitted
that
the
ymca
city
coordination
agreement
which
we
discussed
yesterday,
and
this
is
a
quote,
controlled,
quote,
“not
only
the
ymca
but
also
the
boy’s
club
and
all
of
the
others.”
so,
the
shift
was
not
only
to
the
segregated
ymca,
but
in
the
addendum
7588
4a
you’ll
see
it
was
to
a
white
babe
ruth
league,
to
a
white
dixie
youth
league
parallel
to
little
league
which
was
a
black
league,
to
the
white
city
club
softball
teams,
and
to
the
white
church
league
softball
teams.
these
private
segregated
clubs
are
making
use
of
public
recreational
facilities,
extensive
use.
the
result
is
a
resegregation
of
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery.
and
even
if
one
ignores
the
specific
finding
in
smith
versus
ymca,
that
this
was
done
with
the
intent
to
avoid
desegregation
of
public
recreational
facilities,
certainly,
the
foreseeable
result
of
these
activities
would’ve
been
to
resegregate
those
facilities.
i’d
like
to
make
one
final
comment
on
exclusive
use
which
we
discussed
with
respect
to
the
private
segregated
school
situation
yesterday,
and
that
is
that
it’s
not
simply
some
abstract
theory
that
the
fifth
circuit
discussed
in
support
of
a
legal
doctrine.
the
district
court
was
specifically
instructed
to
include
the
exclusive
use
doctrine
in
its
new
injunction
on
remand,
and
this
it
did
and
that’s
found
at
page
29
(a)
of
the
appendix.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i’m
not
sure
what
your
honor
means.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
excluding
racial
minorities.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
of
course
that
was
the
same
situation
that
existed
in
montgomery
in
1959
when
the
initial
gilmore
case
was
brought.
however,
the
fifth
circuit,
as
best
i
recall,
did
not
discuss,
that
may
have
been
an
underlying
reason
but
it
was
not
discussed
in
the
opinion,
and
exclusive
use
seem
to
be
directed
more
at
ensuring
that
individual
students
or
individual
citizens
did
not
become
subjected
to
an
exclusion
from
public
recreational
facilities.
but
of
course,
the
district
court’s
order
never
--
there’s
nothing
in
the
district
court’s
order
which
would’ve
done
that
anyhow
and
that
was
why
i
couldn’t
understand
the
reason
for
the
exclusive
use
doctrine
being
incorporated
into
a
--
in
the
fifth
circuit’s
opinion.
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
it’s
erroneous
but
it
is
the
law
in
the
fifth
circuit
now.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
agree.
with
the
exception
of
private
segregate
--
when
you’re
assisting
private
segregated
schools
and
thereby
detracting
from
the
public
school
system
in
a
peculiar
situation
that
you
have
in
the
south
and
in
montgomery
then
of
course,
you
enter
into
another
area
where
you
can’t
give
support.
you
can’t
enhance
the
programs
of
these
private
segregated
academies.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
not
if
it
were
a
school-initiated
activity.
individually,
there's
no
difficulty
and
we’ve
never
--
certainly,
we
never
make
any
attempt
to
keep
any
citizen
out
of
public
recreational
facilities.
that’s
never
been
the
point,
but
as
a
school-initiated
program
either
curriculum
or
athletic
program,
it
would
be
prohibited
under
our
theory
of
the
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
it
would've
--
the
district
court
would
have
barred
the
use.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
by
a
private
segregated
club
and
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
that
in
full.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that’s
correct.
well,
i
see
my
time
is
up,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
civil
rights
litigation
comes
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it
follows
a
reversal
in
part
and
an
affirmance
in
part
of
an
opinion
and
an
injunction
issued
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
and
although
only
two
rather
narrow
issues
remain
for
consideration
by
this
court,
the
litigation
started
out
as
a
rather
complex
set
of
suits
and
motions
which
reigned
at
solving
a
problem
of
resegregation
of
public
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery,
alabama.
prior
to
1959,
all
public
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery
were
segregated
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
city
ordinance.
in
1959,
the
district
court
of
the
middle
district
in
the
initial
gilmore
case,
the
first
stage
of
this
case,
entered
an
order
requiring
desegregation
of
all
public
recreational
facilities.
now,
the
city’s
response
to
this
order
was
to
close
all
of
the
parks,
all
of
the
recreational
facilities
in
the
city.
at
about
that
same
time,
1958-1959,
the
city
first
began
to
cooperate
with
the
local
private
segregated
ymca
by
entering
into
a
coordination
agreement,
turning
over
many
public
recreational
programs
to
the
ymca.
other
changes
throughout
the
60's
and
in
the
early
70's
in
the
recreational
programs
of
the
city
brought
about
a
situation
which
the
original
gilmore
plaintiffs
sought
to
correct.
the
desegregation
of
recreational
facilities
ordered
in
1959
had
been
effectively
negated,
in
our
opinion,
by
increasing
resegregation
throughout
the
decade
of
the
60's.
there
were
three
interrelated
suits
and
motions
which
were
filed
in
order
to
try
and
do
what
could
be
done
to
undo
what
we
term
“resegregation.”
first,
in
1970
the
district
court,
in
response
to
a
complaint
filed
against
the
private
ymca,
found
that
defendant
to
be
conducting
in
concert
with
the
city
extensive
segregated
recreational
programs.
the
court
determined
the
ymca
was
inseparable
from
the
city
itself
and
ordered
desegregation
of
the
ymca.
second,
in
1970,
the
present
petitioners,
in
another
aspect
of
the
gilmore
case,
reopened
gilmore
alleging
vast
inequalities
in
the
provision
of
public
recreational
facilities
to
blacks
in
the
community
when
compared
to
what
whites
received.
after
one
day
of
trial
at
which
the
court
made
a
preliminary
finding
that,
petitioners,
plaintiffs
then,
had
made
a
strong
case
or
a
strong
showing
of
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
city
entered
into
an
agreement
which
if
followed
would
significantly
and
vastly
improve
recreational
facilities
in
black
neighborhoods
in
montgomery.
third
and
finally,
in
1972,
the
district
court
entered
the
injunction,
the
order
and
opinion
which
really
forms
the
basis
of
this
particular
stage
of
the
litigation.
there,
the
district
court
said
and
actually
issued
a
two-pronged
injunction,
enjoining
the
city
from
authorizing
private
segregated
school
use
of
public
recreational
facilities
and
also
enjoining
that
same
use
by
private
segregated
non-school
clubs
and
organizations.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
segregated
school
aspect
of
the
case
only
insofar
as
the
use
by
the
school
proved
to
be
what
the
fifth
circuit
termed
an
“exclusive
use.”
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
the
exclusive
use
is
entire
issue.
that
is
really
what
is
before
this
court
as
to
schools.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir,
with
the
exception
of
exclusive
use,
they
infer
--
they
affirmed
the
district
court
entirely.
we
consider
exclusive
use
to
be
a
major
problem
in
the
enforcement
of
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
going
to
a
park
or
going
to
a
zoo
is
recreational
activity
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
for
example,
i
think
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
agreement
that
was
actually
entered
into
between
the
city
and
the
ymca
in
19
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
believe
it's
a
very
serious
issue
and
i
think
if
you
would
look
at
the
agreement
that
was
entered
into,
which
is
in
our
reply
brief,
addendum
page
134
(a).
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
this
is
1965
when
this
became
--
submitted
into
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
cannot
because
the
only
issue
that
the
fifth
circuit
spoke
directly
to
was
private
--
it
was
the
private
segregated
school
use
of
football
fields,
and
then
it
said,
“and
similar
uses”
or
something
to
that
effect
so
that
i
don't
know
what
other
uses
would
be
banned,
would
be
forbidden.
presumably
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
we
are
challenging
the
exclusive
use
doctrine
of
the
court
of
appeals.
for
example,
if
you
get
away
from
the
football
field
factual
situation
which
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it,
what
do
you
do
in
a
situation
where
there
are
six
basketball
courts
available
and
the
private
segregated
academy
is
only
using
one
of
the
courts,
is
that
an
exclusive
use?
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
but
well,
we're
--
what
we're
trying
to
say
is
that
exclusive
use
is
not
a
definition
that
you
can
deal
with
in
this
situation.
what
you
have
to
look
to
is
whether
or
not
your
enhancing
the
program
or
the
curriculum
of
the
private
segregated
academy.
and
whether
the
exclusive
--
the
use
is
exclusive
or
nonexclusive
is
immaterial.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that
is
--
that's
correct,
may
not
exclusively
use
a
public
football
field.
now,
may
not
exclusively
use
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
exclusively.
i
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
presumably,
since
the
fifth
circuit
says
that
exclusive
use
is
the
only
use
that
is
barred.
then,
if
you
could
figure
a
way
to
use
a
portion
of
the
football
field
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
would
think
--
i
am
not
sure
you
have
that
in
the
order.
i
know,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
city
is
not
permitting
that
use.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
possibly
so.
the
question--
what
is
exclusive
use?
you
get
right
back
to
the
problem
of
defining
exclusive
use.
i
might
point
out
that
the
fifth
circuit
itself
runs
up
against
the
problem
because
in
a
portion
of
the
stipulation
of
facts
submitted
to
the
fifth
circuit,
one
of
the
stipulations
was
to
the
effect,
i
do
not
have
it
right
before
me
but
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
--
that
segregated
--
there
was
no
exclusive
use.
we
stipulated
that
there
was
no
exclusive
use
of
these
recreational
facilities
by
private
segregated
academies
and
yet
the
fifth
circuit’s
own
opinion
upholds
the
injunction
against
segregated
academy’s
use
of
these
football
fields.
it's
--
we're
saying
it
is
an
unworkable
definition
and
that
that
is
not
the
issue
that
you
should
look
to.
what
one
has
to
look
to
is
whether
or
not
this
private
segregated
academy’s
program,
curriculum,
whatever
is
being
enhanced
very,
very
much
in
the
vain
of
the
norwood,
of
the
norwood
case.
is
the
program
being
enhanced
in
some
way
by
what
the
city
service
is
being
provided?
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
so,
and
i
believe
your
honor
spoke
to
that
very
kind
of
point
in
the
norwood
case
when
you
discussed
the
difference
between
religious
activity
which
is,
if
i
could
be
so
bold
as
to
say,
considered
generally
to
be
a
good
activity.
it's
not
something
that's
banned
by
the
constitution.
and
the
segregation
is
the
activity
which
is
something
that
is
spoken
directly
to
in
the
thirteen
and
fourteenth
amendments
where,
i
hate
to
use
a
good
and
evil
type
definition,
but
that's
essentially
what
i
think
this
court
was
saying
in
the
norwood
case.
and,
however
now
a
different
situation
might
be
presented
if
the
school,
for
example,
were
a
segregated
catholic
academy.
then,
the
fact
of
its
catholicism
would
have
no
effect
on
the
segregated
aspect
of
the
school.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
absolutely,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
allows
nonexclusive
use
by
private
segregated
academies
of
public
recreational
facilities.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
that
it
is
important
in
this
context
to
make
note
of
the
factual
situation
we
find
in
montgomery,
alabama.
we’re
not
talking
about
any
other
section
of
the
country
or
any
other
part
of
the
country.
we’re
talking
about
a
city
that
has
a
history
of
segregation
and
recreation,
and
i
don’t
want
to
get
off
into
other
public
facilities
because
i
don’t
feel
that
that
this
case
deals
with
other
public
facilities.
it
deals
with
public
recreation
facilities
in
montgomery
and
there’s
a
unique
factual
background
there.
and
i
think
that’s
where
the
equal
protection
violations,
if
any,
and
we
contend
that
they
do,
must
be
viewed
from
that
point
of
view.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
the
issue
there
is
completely
different.
we
believe
that
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
only
if
the
activity
is
school
initiated.
if
individual
citizens
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
would
indeed
be
a
constitutional
violation
in
and
of
itself
to
prohibit
those
children
in
a
non-school
connected
capacity
from
using
public
recreational
facilities.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
or
program
of
the
school.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
is
not
restrict
it
to
schools.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
once
again,
granting
that
a
picnic
is
recreational
in
the
context
of
this
case,
which
i
really
don’t
believe
it
is,
but
let’s
assume
that
it
is,
i
suppose
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
black
muslims
close
their
membership
to
whites
or
do
they
have,
under
the
rule
that
the
district
court
promulgated,
do
they
have
a
policy
of
segregation
in
admissions.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that
is
a
much
better
example
because
they
were
dealing
strictly
with
recreational
activities
that
had
gone
on
in
the
past
in
this
case.
and
in
that
situation,
if
you
can’t
apply
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
segregated
black
groups,
and
i’m
not
at
all
100%
certain
that
you
can,
but
if
you
can,
then
the
black
group
with
the
policy
of
segregation
in
its
admissions
policy
would
be
treated
the
same
as
a
white
group
with
the
policy
of
segregation
because
the
whole
purpose
of
this
series
of
lawsuits
since
1959
has
been
to
desegregate
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery,
alabama.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
the
private
class
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
recognize
that
problem.
i’d
first
like
to
point
out
that
the
court
at
the
same
appendix,
15
(a),
made
a
finding
which
seems
inconsistent
with
that
footnote
that
a
period
--
that
there
was
a
periodic
and
i
quote,
“a
periodic
use
of
recreational
facilities
by
private
clubs.”
now,
there
was
evidence
in
the
--
in
all
of
the
pleadings
which
the
district
court
considered,
that
is,
the
complaint,
the
answer,
the
motion
which
was
a
verified
motion,
there
was
evidence
that
all
private
--
that
no
one
was
excluded,
but
all
private
clubs
and
all
private
organizations
were
indeed
permitted
to
use
these
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
much
to
the
addendum
to
our
reply
brief
deals
with
that
very
problem
and
we
recognize
this
problem.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
think
though
that
submitting
on
a
stipulation
of
facts,
which
we
of
course
did,
and
perhaps
all
of
this
is
the
result
of
an
over
familiarity
by
us
as
lawyers
and
by
the
court
with
this
case
because
there's
been
so
much
litigation
in
the
past
few
years.
but
the
district
court
did
have
before
it,
the
district
court
level,
a
great
deal
of
evidence
in
the
gilmore
case
of
1970.
that
was
the
motion
we
filed
on
behalf
of
petitioners
to
equalize
recreational
facilities
in
the
city
of
montgomery,
both
blacks
as
well
as
whites.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
before
i
get
into
that,
and
i
do
want
to
talk
about
what
was
before
the
court,
that
despite
the
circuit
court’s
contention
that
there
was
in
--
that
there
were
insufficient
facts
and
evidence
it
nevertheless
has
now
affected
a
rule
of
law
which
controls
every
district
court
within
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
sir?
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
it
did.
that’s
my
understanding.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
it
finally
set
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
right
of
association
was
such
an
overwhelming
right
when
compared
to
any
right
that
--
to
any
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
they
reached
the
constitutional
issue
so
we
have
this
--
if
there
was
never
a
fact
in
the
case,
we
still
have
a
rule
of
law
that
exists
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
we
think
needs
correcting.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes
sir,
or
as
the
petitioner's
suggestion
would
be
rather
than
that,
that
perhaps
this
is
a
situation
where
the
district
court
should
have
an
opportunity
to
reexamine
the
factual
situation
on
remand
and
it
might
turn
out
to
be
administratively
burdensome,
and
that
the
district
court
is
going
to
make
findings
of
fact
based
upon
evidence
that
it
did
have
before
it
that
was
not
included
to
the
record
going
to
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that
would
be
an
accurate
statement
of
our
position.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
once
again,
i
don’t
know
that
an
art
gallery
has
ever
been
an
issue
in
any
of
these
recreational
cases.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
think
this,
and
again
this
is
a
little
bit
away
from
the
recreational
area
that
in
my
opinion,
aside
from
this
case
that
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
because
it
is
an
enhancement
of
the
curriculum
of
the
school
and
it
is
a
school-oriented,
school-initiated
program.
it’s
a
vast
benefit
to
the
school.
it
is
certainly
something
that
the
school
should
not
be
permitted
to
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
it’s
a
benefit
to
the
school.
it
enhances
the
school.
it
makes
the
parents
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
we
have
suggested
two
possible
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
we
have
suggested
two
possible
exceptions.
one,
justice
rehnquist
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist
promulgated
in
moose
lodge
case
that
is,
necessities
of
life
and
that
that
was
once
again
mentioned
in
norwood
and
the
other
is
any
bar
that
might
totally
ban
the
existence
of
the
school
within
--
in
the
lines
of
something
--
in
the
lines
on
pierce
versus
society
of
sisters.
those
are
arguably
exceptions
and
streets,
public
sidewalks,
sewage
facilities,
those
all
come
within
it,
i
think,
at
least
the
necessities
of
life
exception
that
we
suggested.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
think
that’s
very
much
like
the
norwood
case
where
you
issue
free
--
where
you
free
--
issue
free
textbooks
to
all
students
in
public
schools,
but
not
free
textbooks
to
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
because
they
were
students
in
private
segregated
schools
and
because
the
permission
to
use
these
facilities
would
enhance
the
school
itself
and
would
be
of
great
benefit
to
it.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
have
specifically
written
to
that
several
times
in
or
at
least
tried
to
in
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
lunch
programs,
i
don’t
see
any
distinction
between
lunch
programs
and
textbooks.
that
may
be
the
most
analogous
situation.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
we’re
getting
far
afield
from
recreational
facilities,
but
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
could
not
draw
a
distinction.
i
could
not
draw
a
distinction
between
the
milk
situation
and
the
textbook
situation.
that’s
available
from
another
source.
you
can
buy
milk
from
another
source.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
might
well
come
be
under
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
only
two
further
points
that
i’d
like
to
make
with
respect
to
this
case.
we
have
provided
the
court
with
an
addendum
to
petitioners’
reply
brief
which
is
some
152
pages
in
length.
now,
all
of
this
evidence
found
in
this
addendum
was
introduced
in
judge
johnson’s
court
in
the
district
court
in
the
1970
phase
of
the
gilmore
case.
that’s
the
phase
that
dealt
with
equalization
of
public
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery.
this
present
litigation,
that
is
this
motion
for
supplemental
relief
in
the
gilmore
case,
was
initiated
less
than
eight
months
after
the
order
of
the
court
approving
the
agreement
between
the
petitioners
and
the
city
in
that
gilmore
case.
these
facts
are
material
because
they
were
before
judge
johnson
by
virtue
of
his
authority
to
take
judicial
notice
of
his
own
court
records,
and
because
the
testimony
therein
would
have
clearly
supported
the
injunction
with
respect
to
private
segregated
clubs
and
organizations
used
of
public
recreational
facilities.
i
think
the
keyword
in
examining
these
facts
is
“shift.”
there
was
a
shift
of
white
recreational
programs
which
were
formally
in
the
province
solely
of
the
city
and
the
recreation
department
to
private
clubs
and
organizations.
so
the
city
maintained
control
only
over
the
black
recreational
programs.
now
mayor
james
himself,
at
the
addendum
page
19
(a),
who
was
the
mayor
at
the
time
that
all
these
went
on,
admitted
that
the
ymca
city
coordination
agreement
which
we
discussed
yesterday,
and
this
is
a
quote,
controlled,
quote,
“not
only
the
ymca
but
also
the
boy’s
club
and
all
of
the
others.”
so,
the
shift
was
not
only
to
the
segregated
ymca,
but
in
the
addendum
7588
4a
you’ll
see
it
was
to
a
white
babe
ruth
league,
to
a
white
dixie
youth
league
parallel
to
little
league
which
was
a
black
league,
to
the
white
city
club
softball
teams,
and
to
the
white
church
league
softball
teams.
these
private
segregated
clubs
are
making
use
of
public
recreational
facilities,
extensive
use.
the
result
is
a
resegregation
of
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery.
and
even
if
one
ignores
the
specific
finding
in
smith
versus
ymca,
that
this
was
done
with
the
intent
to
avoid
desegregation
of
public
recreational
facilities,
certainly,
the
foreseeable
result
of
these
activities
would’ve
been
to
resegregate
those
facilities.
i’d
like
to
make
one
final
comment
on
exclusive
use
which
we
discussed
with
respect
to
the
private
segregated
school
situation
yesterday,
and
that
is
that
it’s
not
simply
some
abstract
theory
that
the
fifth
circuit
discussed
in
support
of
a
legal
doctrine.
the
district
court
was
specifically
instructed
to
include
the
exclusive
use
doctrine
in
its
new
injunction
on
remand,
and
this
it
did
and
that’s
found
at
page
29
(a)
of
the
appendix.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i’m
not
sure
what
your
honor
means.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
excluding
racial
minorities.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
well,
of
course
that
was
the
same
situation
that
existed
in
montgomery
in
1959
when
the
initial
gilmore
case
was
brought.
however,
the
fifth
circuit,
as
best
i
recall,
did
not
discuss,
that
may
have
been
an
underlying
reason
but
it
was
not
discussed
in
the
opinion,
and
exclusive
use
seem
to
be
directed
more
at
ensuring
that
individual
students
or
individual
citizens
did
not
become
subjected
to
an
exclusion
from
public
recreational
facilities.
but
of
course,
the
district
court’s
order
never
--
there’s
nothing
in
the
district
court’s
order
which
would’ve
done
that
anyhow
and
that
was
why
i
couldn’t
understand
the
reason
for
the
exclusive
use
doctrine
being
incorporated
into
a
--
in
the
fifth
circuit’s
opinion.
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
it’s
erroneous
but
it
is
the
law
in
the
fifth
circuit
now.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
i
agree.
with
the
exception
of
private
segregate
--
when
you’re
assisting
private
segregated
schools
and
thereby
detracting
from
the
public
school
system
in
a
peculiar
situation
that
you
have
in
the
south
and
in
montgomery
then
of
course,
you
enter
into
another
area
where
you
can’t
give
support.
you
can’t
enhance
the
programs
of
these
private
segregated
academies.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
not
if
it
were
a
school-initiated
activity.
individually,
there's
no
difficulty
and
we’ve
never
--
certainly,
we
never
make
any
attempt
to
keep
any
citizen
out
of
public
recreational
facilities.
that’s
never
been
the
point,
but
as
a
school-initiated
program
either
curriculum
or
athletic
program,
it
would
be
prohibited
under
our
theory
of
the
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
it
would've
--
the
district
court
would
have
barred
the
use.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
by
a
private
segregated
club
and
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
that
in
full.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
levin,
jr.
that’s
correct.
well,
i
see
my
time
is
up,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
