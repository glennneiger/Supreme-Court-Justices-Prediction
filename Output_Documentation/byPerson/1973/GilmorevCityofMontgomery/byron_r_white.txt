justice
byron
r.
white
that's
most
of
that
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it
is
really
a
--
they
today
affirmed
the
district
court
almost
entirely
with
respect
to
schools,
isn't
that
really?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
says
they
will
--
that
non-exclusive
use
by
segregated
academies
should
not
be
there,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
like
they're
going
to
the
zoo?
justice
byron
r.
white
go
in
the
park?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
give
me
an
example,
give
me
an
example
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
find
out
why
this
is
a
serious
issue
in
the
case
at
all,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
challenging
a
nonexclusive
use
doctrine
in
the
sense
that
the
segregated
school
should
be
barred
from
so-called
nonexclusive
use
as
well
as
exclusive
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
suppose,
under
the
court
of
appeals'
order,
a
segregated
academy,
a
segregated
academy
team
could
play
a
nonsegregated
academy
team?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
didn’t
congress
post
the
case
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
lunch
programs?
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
i
think
that
the
district
court
would’ve
barred
the
exclusive
use
of
public
recreation
facilities
by
any
private
club
that
had
an
express
discriminatory
policy
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
full
and
the
effect
of
that
is
that
a
private
club
with
an
express
discriminatory
policy
may
use
public
recreation
facilities?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
exclusive
or
nonexclusive?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn’t
it
--
well,
this
--
did
this
order
we
have
here
arose
from
a
supplemental
petition
in
a
case
that
had
been
within
the
--
filed
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
original
order
in
19’59
was
that
the
city
was
segregating
in
its
recreational
policies?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
in
fact,
but
if
you
a
--
wouldn’t
the
best
counter
is
that
part
of
that
order,
as
an
effective
remedy
to
say
that
private
clubs
couldn’t
use
if
they
were
discriminatory
--
if
they
had
a
discriminatory
policy
could
not
use
city
made
recreational
facilities?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
--
did
judge
johnson
ever
articulate
any
reasons
or
basis
for
entering
this
supplemental
injunction
that
included
this
prohibition
against
use
by
judge
johnson?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
did
you
--
do
you
concede
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
affirming
judge
johnson
with
respect
to
the
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree
the
city
may
not
make
public
recreational
facilities
available
to
a
private
school
in
the
manner
that
they
can
make
it
available
to
a
private
club?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
a
yes
or
no
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
well
assume
you
say
you
agree,
said
that
the
city
may
not
make
its
recreational
facilities
available
on
an
exclusive
basis
even
periodically
to
a
private
segregated
school,
whether
it
has
a
racial
discriminatory
policy
or
it
is
just
all-white,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
it
--
and
you
have
said
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
the
situation
different
with
respect
to
a
private
club
that
has
an
expressed
discriminatory
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
has
an
affirmative
duty
because
it
is
a
--
has
--
it
is
under
an
order
of
the
federal
district
court
affirmatively
to
deseg
--
to
quit
discriminating.
it's
under
an
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
still
subject
to
that
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
may
be
that
generally,
absent
such
an
order,
you
--
the
city
--
the
pure
neutrality
would
be
unexceptionable.
but
if
they
are
under
an
affirmative
duty,
under
an
order,
how
do
you
distinguish
between
schools
and
clubs?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
are
not
running
from
the
order,
but
you
do
have
to
inquire
about
the
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
private
schools.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
most
of
that
issue,
