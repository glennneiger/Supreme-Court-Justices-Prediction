i
suppose
that
reflects
the
judicial
practice
of
this
court
following
brown
versus
board
of
education
entering
orders,
making
parks

like
public
places
open

because
that
you’ve
been

the
(inaudible)
you
were
born,
we
had
cases
here
involving
the
park
or
swimming
pool
or
--
a
racial
minority
couldn’t
go
to
play
baseball
or
walk
or
have
a
picnic

a

and
our
decrees
in
those
cases
as
i

merely
prevent
the

from

justice
william

douglas
and
i
suppose
that’s
reflected
in
the
court
of
appeals’
approach.
up
to
that
time,
many
of
the
parks
in
some
areas
of
the
country
get
--
have
been
turned
over
exclusively,
you
know
to
the
dominant
race.
justice
william

alright,
well,
i
think,
historically,
it
was
the
practice
that
this
court
in
its
early
decisions
on
recreational
facilities
that
the
fifth
circuit
struck
down.
it’s
not
exclusive.
it’s
everybody.
