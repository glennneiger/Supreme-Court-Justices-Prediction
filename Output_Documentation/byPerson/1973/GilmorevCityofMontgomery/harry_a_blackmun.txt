mr.
levin,
your
case
is
not
restricted
to
schools
here,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
a
question
then.
apart
from
the
school
background,
suppose
a
group
of
black
muslims
wanted
to
have
a
picnic
in
the
city
park
some
saturday
morning,
under
the
court
of
appeals
decree,
is
this
possible?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
they
do
and
to
get
away
from
the
picnic,
suppose
they
wanted
to
use
a
basketball
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
number
72-1517
is
gilmore
against
the
city
of
montgomery.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
is
but
another
chapter
in
prolong
litigation.
the
lawsuit
began
in
1958
when
the
petitioners
who
are
negro
citizens
of
montgomery,
sued
to
desegregate
the
city’s
public
parks.
they
were
successful
and
the
district
court
ordered
the
parks
desegregated.
thereafter,
however,
segregated
recreational
programs
were
developed
by
the
city
in
cooperation
with
the
local
ymca
and
recreational
facilities
in
negro
neighborhoods
were
not
maintained
equally
with
others.
the
petitioners
accordingly
in
1970
moved
to
reopen
the
litigation
based
on
the
facts
developed
in
a
separate
action,
involving
the
ymca.
those
claims
were
settled
by
agreement,
but
then,
however
in
1971,
the
petitioners
moved
for
further
relief.
they
complained
that
the
city
was
permitting
segregated
schools
and
segregated
private
groups
and
clubs
to
use
city
parks
and
recreational
facilities.
the
district
court
enjoined
the
city
from
permitting
the
use
of
municipal
recreational
facilities
by
any
racially
segregated
private
school
or
group,
or
by
any
non-school
group
or
club
that
had
a
discriminatory
admissions
policy.
on
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
sustained
the
injunction
with
respect
to
what
it
called
exclusive
use
by
segregated
schools,
but
reversed
insofar
as
the
injunction
applied
to
nonexclusive
use
by
segregated
schools
and
to
any
use
by
non-school
groups.
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
the
city
was
properly
enjoined
from
permitting
exclusive
access
to
its
recreational
facilities
by
segregated
private
schools
and
by
groups
affiliated
with
such
schools.
we
reason
as
to
this
that
the
city’s
policies
contravene
an
outstanding
school
desegregation
court
order
intended
to
perpetuate
a
dual
school
system.
the
majority
of
the
court,
however,
feel
that
on
this
record,
it
is
not
possible
to
determine
whether
nonexclusive
use
by
private
school
groups
in
common
with
others
and
by
non-school
groups
involve
the
city
so
directly
in
the
actions
of
those
users
as
to
warrant
court
intervention
on
constitutional
grounds.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
joins
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
and

in
