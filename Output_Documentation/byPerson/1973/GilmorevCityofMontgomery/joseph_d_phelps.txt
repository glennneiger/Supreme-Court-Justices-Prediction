mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i’d
like
to
clarify
just
a
little
bit
concerning
the
record
in
the
case
and
specifically
the
reply
brief
that
the
petitioners
filed
last
week
in
which
they
attach
depositions
or
parts
or
parts
of
depositions
as
addendum.
now,
these
depositions
were
taken,
as
mr.
levin
pointed
out,
in
1970.
i
think
may
--
it
may
be
well
to
go
in
and
look
at
the
sequence
or
chronology
of
this
case.
it
was
--
original
complaint,
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
levin,
was
december
28,
1958
or
order
posed
in
the
case
by
the
district
court
on
april
22,
1964.
then
in
1970,
on
august
12,
1970,
the
petitioners
filed
a
motion
to
cite
for
contempt
and
for
relief.
and
in
that
august
12,
1970
motion
they
did
raise
the
issue
of
this
resegregation.
they
raised
the
issue
of
the
ymca
case
which
been
decided
a
month
before.
it
was
pursuant
to
that
hearing
that
these
depositions
were
taken
or
it
was
pursuant
to
that
motion
that
these
depositions
were
taken.
and
that
case
resulted
in
the
joint
filing
of
a
plan
for
extensive
improvement
of
recreational
facilities
throughout
the
city.
montgomery,
as
many
other
communities,
we
had
recreation
facilities
in
one
part
of
town
that
weren't
as
good
as
another.
some
in
the
black
community,
one
is
good
as
some
of
the
white.
some
in
--
some
portions
of
the
white,
one
is
good
in
some
portions
as
the
black,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
city,
by
a
joint
motion
agreed
to
equalize
all
facilities.
we
had
just
finished
a
community
center
at
the
time
the
filing
of
the
petition.
it
was
completed
about
that
time
in
a
lower
income
in
negro
area.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
we
say
facilities
ought
to
be
as
good
as
we
can
possibly
make
them
all
over
town,
we
agreed
to
do
that
and
judge
johnson
approved
this
plan
and
found
that
was
dispositive
of
all
the
issues
before
the
court.
and
that
was
in
december
of
1971
when
the
district
court
said
that
the
joint
plan
disposed
of
all
issues
before
the
court,
and
that
appears
in
the
appendix,
in
the
very
outset
when
the
chronology
of
the
case
is
set
forth.
then,
far
than
that
and
after
all
those
issues
were
disposed
of
in
september
of
1971,
the
petitioners
came
along
and
filed
a
petition
for
supplemental
relief
and
that’s
the
basic
--
basis
of
this
present
proceeding.
now,
the
basis
for
the
supplemental
relief
was
largely,
and
i
think,
a
fair
reading
of
it
discloses
that
it
dealt
with
private
schools
and
private
academies.
let’s
go
for
a
moment
and
look
at
the
depositions
that
mr.
levin
attaches
to
his
reply
brief,
and
he
includes,
and
i
think
very
significantly,
in
this
case.
if
you
look
back
at
those
depositions,
i
skip
from
page
20
to
page
40,
in
some
instances
and
a
whole
lot
of
them
are
omitted.
now,
we
didn’t
have
enough
--
he
didn’t
designate
these
as
part
of
his
appendix
and,
of
course,
we
had
no
opportunity
to
counter
designate
so
we
have
had
delivered
to
the
clerk’s
office
the
entire
deposition.
and,
we’ve
asked
the
court
if
they
deem
these
depositions
--
if
the
court
deems
these
depositions
appropriate
before
the
court,
all
of
them
should
certainly
be
considered.
for
example,
he
talks
about
segregated
babe
ruth,
but
on
page
15
of
a
deposition
of
mr.
mckean
and
he
omitted
this
from
the
part
he
put
back
in
this
addendum.
as
far
as
babe
ruth
is
specific
in
here,
it
says
no
distinction
be
made
between
black
and
white,
absolutely
not.
there
has
never
been
any
distinction
in
as
far
as
babe
ruth
leagues,
nationally
or
from
the
state,
no
distinction
with
regard
to
race.
that’s
omitted
from
what
he’s
got
here,
but
we
have
delivered
it
to
the
clerk’s
office.
mr.
mckean
said
they
put
out
notices
at
all
schools
for
children
who
want
to
play
babe
ruth
or
boys
who
want
to
play
babe
ruth
to
come
and
attend.
dixie
youth,
he
mentioned
that
this
morning,
he
mentioned
that
in
his
addendum.
he
attached
some
depositions
of
a
mr.
marshall,
but
he
didn’t
attach
them
all.
and
the
parts
that
he
didn’t
attach
say
this
on
page
16,
“no
restriction
against
blacks
playing.
all
dixie
youth
leagues
invite
black
boys
to
come
out.
no
boy
is
excluded
because
of
race.”
leagues
formed
on
a
geographic
population
basis
in
which
black
neighborhoods
and
communities
are
included
on
page
26,
page
30.
blacks
are
in
fact,
in
all
dixie
youth
teams.
on
page
30,
solicitation
done
for
dixie
youth
in
black
neighborhoods.
page
32,
for
the
coming
year,
more
blacks
were
urged
and
hopefully
would
come
out
and
in
point
of
fact,
they
did.
in
point
of
fact,
babe
ruth
leagues,
athlete
--
athletics
in
montgomery,
alabama
and
throughout
the
state
of
alabama
encouraged
participation
by
all
people
without
regard
to
race
or
color.
alabama,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
proud
of
the
black
athletes.
they
play
for
our
colleges
throughout
the
state.
the
university
of
alabama,
for
example,
has
many,
many
black
players
on
the
starting
basketball
team
that
played
the
university
of
mississippi
the
other
night.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
depositions
that
he
attaches
here
are
not
complete
and
these
were
submitted
in
august
1970
prior
to
the
plaintiffs
and
the
city
agreeing
on
this
joint
plan
for
improvement.
why
were
they
able
to
agree
on
the
joint
plan
for
improvement
and
not
go
into
the
issue
of
“resegregation”
in
their
disposing
of
all
issues?
i
submit
to
you
that
the
depositions
that
were
all
filed
in
the
district
court,
and
were
left
up
high
over
from
what
he
sends
up
here,
establish
why
they
did
that,
because
they
saw
that
there
was
no
distinction
in
this
babe
ruth,
little
league,
or
anywhere
else.
as
far
as
the
city
of
montgomery
is
concerned,
he
attaches
a
deposition
--
parts
of
a
deposition
from
a
mr.
boldman.
what
he
doesn’t
attach
shows
that
there
is
integrative
participation
in
public
recreation
throughout
the
spectrum
of
montgomery
alabama.
football,
basketball,
baseball
are
integrated.
you
have
integrated
teams
playing
integrated
teams
and
predominantly
white
playing
predominantly
black
throughout
on
page
49,
50,
and
56
of
mr.
boldman’s
deposition
which,
significantly,
he
didn’t
attach.
so
we
think,
first,
that
the
issues
--
all
which
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
it
--
it's
an
argument
that
the
depositions
that
he
refers
to
are
establish
that
the
city
of
montgomery
does
not
discriminate
in
recreational
activities
and
programs
because
of
race
or
color
and
it
is
an
argument
too,
sir,
that
this
was
before
the
district
court
in
1970
when
the
district
court
approved
a
joint
motion
for
improvement.
the
issue
was
before
the
court
on
this
alleged
resegregation.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
district
court
in
the
order
forming
the
basis
of
this
appeal,
if
it
please
the
court,
ever
made
no
finding
of
resegregation
and
we
are
saying
to
the
court
that
the
reason
he
made
no
finding
of
resegregation
is
because,
in
point
of
fact,
there
was
none.
he
said
this,
“when
there
joint
improvement
petition
was
approved.”
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
he
rested
the
injunction
on
the
fact
that
the
pure
simple
fact
that
an
all-white
private
school
should
not
be
able
to
use
a
municipal
facility,
one
and
then
secondly
on
the
issue
of
private
organizations,
without
resegregation,
private
organizations
shouldn’t
use
municipal
facilities
if
they
have
a
racially
discriminatory
admissions
policy.
i
don’t
think,
in
the
point
i’m
hoping
to
make
and
maybe
i’m
not
doing
it
too
clearly
here,
is
that
the
issue
of
resegregation
was
not
part
of
the
district
court’s
order.
it
was
not
part
of
the
district
court’s
order.
the
district
court
in
the
order,
they
formed
the
basis
of
this
writ,
found
that
the
city
made
facilities
available
to
all
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
when
he
had
these
depositions
before
him
back
in
1970,
what
did
he
say
when
we
filed
a
joint
motions
for
improvement?
the
district
court
said
it
further
appears
that
the
implementation
of
said
agreement
and
plans
would
dispose
of
all
of
the
issues
involved
in
this
litigation
and
what
were
those
issues?
those
issues
included
the
issue
of
this
alleged
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
i
think
that
tells
us
this.
mr.
levin,
and
on
his
brief,
reply
brief
and
in
this
court,
contends
that
there
has
been
type
of
a
resegregation.
he
says
the
district
court
is
bound
to
have
known
that.
we
state
to
you
that
the
district
court
knew
to
the
contrary
because
of
the
fortunes
of
the
testimony
that
was
already
before
him.
he
knew,
to
the
contrary,
resegregation
didn’t
enter
into
it
as
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
it
was
predicated
on
the
district
court’s
feelings
and
understanding
of
the
law
that
because
a
private
club
had
a
racially
discriminatory
admission
policy,
that
private
club
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
a
public
recreational
facility.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
district
court
intended
to
imply
by
that,
that
the
city
was
guilty
of
any
evasion
of
a
prior
court
order.
as
judge
clark
pointed
out
on
footnote
14
in
the
circuit
court
opinion,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
evasion
of
the
city
responsibility
to
operate
recreational
facilities
on
a
desegregated
basis
by
the
subterfuges
converting
such
facilities
to
private
control.
the
district
court
had
been
presented
with
substance
for
that
finding
and
even
the
plaintiffs
themselves
in
the
fifth
circuit,
on
page
12
of
their
brief
in
the
fifth
circuit,
took
the
position
in
the
fifth
circuit
agree
to
neutrality
on
behalf
of
the
city.
the
fact
that
the
state
officials
have
presented
a
racially
neutral
policy
and
that
the
actual
discrimination
has
occurred
at
the
hands
of
private
individuals,
has
never
been
viewed
by
the
courts
as
a
significant
factor
in
determining
the
constitutionality
of
state
action.
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
purpose
of
my
going
into
this
was
that
that
this
matter
that
we
are
here
today
on
was
not
tried
before
the
district
court
on
an
issue
of
resegregation.
it
was
not
presented
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
an
issue
of
resegregation.
we
submit
to
you
that
it
could
not
have
been
because
such
is
not
defect,
and
we
don’t
go
out
in
thin
air
and
just
say
that
without
support.
we
say
it
is
not
the
fact
because
the
depositions
that
were
actually
before
the
district
court,
as
mr.
levin
pointed
out
earlier,
when
this
issue
was
raised,
they
asked
more
than
just
improvement
in
august
1970.
they
asked
for
contempt
and
they
asked
that
we
would
be
enjoined
from
allowing
these
private
groups
to
do
it.
the
district
court
didn’t
order
that.
he
approved
the
improvement
of
the
facilities
without
finding,
as
mr.
--
judge
clark
said,
“any
involvement
of
the
city’s
responsibility.”
and
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
judge
clark
is
correct,
sir
and
i
think
the
posture
of
the
case
is
--
was
it
--
as
it
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
then
the
district
court
is
such,
that
you
really
could
never
do
it.
they
asked
for
a
broad
spectrum
on
all
the
effect
in
every
private
club
of
every
nature
if
they
got
a
discriminatory
admission
clause.
how
would
you
ever
be
able
to
go
into
the
history,
frequency,
or
effects
of
more
than
100
and
it’s
literally
hundreds
of
private
organizations
that
use
municipal
facilities.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
it
wasn’t
done
in
this
case.
it
was
presented
to
the
district
court
on
a
--
stipulated
facts
that
all
of
the
facilities
were
open
to
all
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
this
case
is
the
proper
vehicle
to
go
down
and
have
a
blanket
order
in
montgomery,
alabama
applying
to
all
types
of
private
clubs
regardless
of
their
size,
regardless
of
the
purpose,
regardless
of
the
frequency
or
use,
a
blanket
order
is
what
judge
clark
says
that
the
--
was
too
broad,
and
i
think
that
that’s
well
supported
by
the
law.
i
think
we
can’t
speculate,
we
can’t
guess
about
the
involvement
going
on.
i
don’t
believe
that’s
what
the
--
this
court
envisioned
in
burton
and
i
think,
as
this
court
said
in
norwood,
you
can’t
just
assume
that
all
of
these
things
are
invidious
and
that’s
what
they
ask
in
this
case
as
an
order,
a
blanket
order
saying
any
club
with
a
discriminatory
admission
policies
can’t
use
municipal
facilities.
we
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
1959
order
ordered
all
facilities
opened
up.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don’t
believe
so,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
feel
strongly
that
it
would
not
have
been
for
several
reasons.
one,
i
the
--
i
don’t
believe
that
the
city
is
under
an
affirmative
duty
to
require
desegregation
in
private
clubs.
and,
secondly,
these
private
clubs,
as
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals,
are
entitled
we
think
now,
as
well
as
then
in
the
periodic
use
of
public
facilities.
they
wouldn’t
found
here
and
they
simply
would
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
as
judge
clark
commented,
no
findings
were
made
on
any
evasion
of
the
city’s
responsibility.
there
weren't
any
findings
that
this
private
clubs
were
a
place
--
a
public
accommodation
or
any
nexus
between
the
private
clubs
and
the
municipality.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
issue
before
judge
johnson,
mr.
justice
marshall,
was
whether
or
not
just
because
a
club
has
admission
policy
that
doesn’t
--
it
excludes
either
whites
or
blacks,
whether
that
in
and
of
itself
would
preclude
that
organization
from
the
use
of
municipal
facilities.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
as
i
under
it,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
the
question
before
you.
i
would
like
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
background,
sir
was
necessitated
or
i
thought
it
was
because
of
this
reply
brief
that
they
filed
last
week
in
which
they
attached
only
portions
of
some
depositions,
and
i
thought
it
appropriate
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
there
was
a
great
deal
more
that
was
brought
out
even
back
then
that
he
didn’t
see
fit
to
include
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
my
going
into
that
portion
of
the
background.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
this
would
--
if
your
honor
please
would
embrace
the
spectrum
from
muslim
to
mormon
with
lion’s
club
and
city
club
and
ladies
garden
clubs
and
bridge
clubs
and
just
everybody,
from
a
group
of
5-500.
it
would
embrace
the
moose
lodge,
the
fraters,
every
conceivable
type
of
private
club,
political,
social,
fraternal,
charitable,
all
or
everybody
as
we
see
it
under
this
order.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
imagine
a
group
would
be
two
or
more
people
that
have
some
type
of
club
relation
between
them,
and
that
would
be
up
to
the
two
or
more
people
to
determine
what
that
was.
i
guess
three
of
us
could
form
a
group.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
not
that
i
can
see,
if
the
court
please.
there’s
nothing
in
his
order
that
discusses
any
type
of
use
or
how
they
go
about
people
and
i
think
judge
clark,
in
the
fifth
circuit
order,
points
that
out.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
this,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
have
to
see,
of
course,
the
--
there
was
an
order
to
prohibit
segregation
in
municipal
recreational
facilities.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
so.
i
think
it
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context
though,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
no
resegregation
has
been
written
to
in
any
stage
and
i
think
the
record
is
barren
of
any
support
of
resegregation.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i’m
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
let
me
say
this.
i
don’t
feel
that
this
present
order
is
even
germane
really
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
--
to
the
1969
order
because
that
opened
everything
up,
and
now
they
have
come
along
and
the
petitioners
ask
that
it
should
be
closed
to
a
particular
group
because
of
the
racial
admissions
policy
of
that
particular
group.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
we
make
no
issue
about
private
schools
in
this
proceeding.
we
don’t
make
that
it’s
even
an
issue.
the
affirmative
duty
on
the
school
boards
and
the
municipality
to
this
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
it
would.
well,
let
me
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i’m
not
sure,
sir.
i’m
not
sure.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
do
not
contest
that.
we
think
that’s
within
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
because
the
city,
as
we
understand
it,
has
no
affirmative
duty
to
maintain
desegregated
or
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir,
and
we
say
we
abide
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright.
i
read
the
1959
order
to
say
open
up
your
recreational
facilities.
open
them
up
without
regard
to
race
or
color.
don’t
keep
any
group
out
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
sir?
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that’s
right,
and
keep
them
open,
and
don’t
turn
a
negro
group
away
or
a
white
group
away.
and,
i
don’t
think
that
the
1959
order
or
any
court
of
this
--
or
any
decision
of
this
court
puts
a
burden
on
a
municipality
to
delve
in
to
the
racial
composition
to
these
groups.
we
think
we
are
in
strict
accord
with
the
1959
order.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
i
think
you
have
to
do
this.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
you
have
to
go
into
the
racial
composition
there
because
it
--
we
have
to
see
that
desegregated
education
is
not
interfered
with
and
not
retarded
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
norwood
versus
harrison.
but
i
don’t
think
that
government
at
any
level
should
be
placed
with
responsibility
of
delving
into
the
membership
policies
of
church
clubs,
social
clubs,
and
political
organizations.
we
think
that
--
we
don’t
plead
that
the
1959
order
of
watson
versus
memphis
or
any
other
decision
requires
us
to
do
that.
now,
i’d
like
to
say
this.
mr.
levin
says
that
montgomery,
alabama
should
be
treated
apart
from
other
parts
of
the
country.
he
says
that,
for
some
reason,
there’s
something
different
about
the
situation
here.
this
community
and
in
this
area
struggled
with
problems
of
desegregation
and
removal
of
discriminatory
practices,
and
we
feel
that
when
we
come
before
this
court
and
say
that
we
are
open,
that
our
facilities
are
open
to
all,
that’s
not
an
empty
promise
or
just
a
statement,
its
documented
by
the
facts
as
they
exist
right
in
montgomery.
for
example,
two
members
of
the
respondent
board
that
are
before
this
court
today
are
black
leaders
in
montgomery.
they
were
appointed
without
any
court
compulsion
and
they’re
there
and
a
part
of
this
case.
a
black
man
is
presently
the
recreation
director
for
the
entire
program.
there
had
been
extensive
construction
of
facilities
throughout
the
city
of
montgomery.
some
by
virtue
of
the
joint
proposal
filed
in
1970
and
1971,
and
some
go
far
beyond
that.
it’s
without
dispute
and
they
don’t
dispute
this
in
their
reply
briefs
that
montgomery
is
commencing
the
construction
of
a
municipal
golf
course
with
swimming
pools
being
opened,
that
will
be
available
to
black
people
and
white
people
and
without
--
everyone
without
regard
to
race
or
color.
there
is
desegregated
participation
in
municipally
sponsored
recreational
activities.
as
pointed
out
in
the
portions
of
the
record
that
he
did
not
include
and
also
in
the
appendix
itself
of
the
--
on
pages
55
and
53.
seventeen
of
those
31
football
games
involved
desegregated
teams
playing
desegregated
teams.
the
august
1st
stipulated
facts
on
which
this
record
is
before
this
court
says
and
states
and
agrees
between
the
parties
that
all
recreational
facilities
throughout
the
city
of
montgomery
are
open
to
all
on
an
equal
basis
with
all
person
to
other
community
have
an
equal
access
thereto
without
regard
to
raise
the
(inaudible).
that’s
not
just
an
empty
statement,
if
the
court
pleases.
it’s
supported
by
the
actual
facts
that
are
living
and
existing
in
montgomery,
alabama
today.
a
comparison
of
the
style
of
this
case,
from
the
appendix
of
how
it
started
out
with
the
parties
that
are
there
now,
show
that
there
had
been
a
complete
change
in
the
park
and
recreation
board.
we’ve
got
a
new
mayor.
we’ve
got
new
members
and
a
biracial
park
and
recreation
board
there
in
montgomery.
the
leadership
now
in
this
area
is
coming
from
biracial
groups.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
he
does.
i
think,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
comment,
that
he
decided
this
case
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
in
irvis.
i
think
he
thought
that
if
a
group
had
a
policy
of
allowing
only
blacks
or
only
whites
in
that
in
that
it's
in
and
if
itself
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
and
what
i
say
to
the
court
is
true.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
these
facts
are
true,
if
the
court
please.
we’ve
got
these
participants
down
there
and
we
state
to
the
court
that
discrimination
in
recreation
in
montgomery,
alabama,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
mentioned
in
the
1969
order,
we
say
we
are
in
strict
compliance
with
it.
any
discrimination
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
montgomery,
alabama
has
been
removed.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
“root
and
branch.”
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
district
court
in
the
order
that’s
before
this
court
made
the
finding
that
the
respondents
allow
all
persons
and
groups
to
use
recreational
facilities
specifically,
and
i
quote,
judge
johnson.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don’t
know,
sir.
i
think
because
he
understood
the
law
to
be
that
we
had
to
go
into
the
racial
composition
and
see
what
kind
of
admissions
policies,
all
the
types
of
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
he
said
this,
and
i
quote,
“the
city
of
montgomery
makes
football,
basketball
and
baseball
facilities
available
to
all
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis
to
private,
to
any
private
groups
who
apply
for
them
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.”
i
agree
with
you,
sir
that
the
district
court
does
know
that
we
have
got
two
black
members
on
the
board
and
it
comes
out
and
publicized
in
the
press
that
a
black
man
is
heading
all
of
the
recreational
programs
throughout
the
city
of
montgomery.
now,
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
this.
they
want
to
use
the
vehicle
of
this
desegregation
case
to
go
into
all
of
the
admissions
policies
of
various
groups
regardless
of
the
size,
composition,
or
purpose
of
the
group.
we
don’t
feel,
in
this
case,
on
remand
or
otherwise
that
this
is
a
proper
vehicle
to
do
it.
the
head
of
a
group
that
they
brought
before
the
court
is
the
ymca,
and
the
court
found
ymca
really
wasn’t
private
because
they
are
all
encompassing
membership
and
therefore,
and
the
connection
that
the
city
and
the
white
cooperating,
an
order
was
entered.
if
they
have
any
examples
that
they
feel
like
the
city
is
using
or
using
the
city
for
subterfuge,
those
part
is
--
they
are
just
--
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
palmer
versus
thompson,
ought
to
be
before
the
court.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
two
he
mentions
today,
the
babe
ruth
and
the
dixie
league,
are
not
discriminatory
as
is
evidenced
by
the
portions
of
the
depositions
that
he
didn’t
include.
but
this
case
is
not
the
vehicle,
we
respectfully
submit,
to
go
in
and
to
put
a
municipality
on
the
basis
of
defending
its
relation
with
all
types
of
private
groups.
we
think
that
in
burton,
the
court
envisioned
a
shifting
and
analysis
of
circumstances
and
with
the
broad
spectrum
that
they
seek
here,
we
say
that
this
case
is
not
the
vehicle.
as
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
burger
stated
in
norwood
versus
harrison,
no
presumptions
flow
from
mere
allegations.
no
one
can
be
required,
consistent
with
due
process,
to
prove
absence
of
violation
of
the
law.
if
they’ve
got
a
specific,
they’ve
got
judicial
retorts,
but
better
than
that,
better
than
that
if
they’ve
got
something
that
they
feel
like
is
re-segregating,
if
they
will
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
park
and
recreation
board
of
the
city
of
montgomery,
if
they
will
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
biracial
park
and
recreation
board,
i
think
it’ll
be
remedied
and
i
state
that
it‘ll
be
remedied
without
the
necessity
of
judicial
intervention.
i
think
that’s
the
posture
of
this
case.
that’s
the
posture
of
what
montgomery,
alabama
is
trying
to
do.
we’ve
made
progress.
he
says
in
his
brief
“we
applaud
it.”
we
are
proud
of
the
progress
that
we’ve
made.
we
think
that
the
facts
are
undisputed
and
documented
speak
for
themselves
that
public
recreational,
public
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery,
alabama
are
open
to
all
without
regard
to
race
or
color
and
we
ask
this
court
to
allow
us
to
continue
to
keep
them
opened
up.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i’d
like
to
clarify
just
a
little
bit
concerning
the
record
in
the
case
and
specifically
the
reply
brief
that
the
petitioners
filed
last
week
in
which
they
attach
depositions
or
parts
or
parts
of
depositions
as
addendum.
now,
these
depositions
were
taken,
as
mr.
levin
pointed
out,
in
1970.
i
think
may
--
it
may
be
well
to
go
in
and
look
at
the
sequence
or
chronology
of
this
case.
it
was
--
original
complaint,
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
levin,
was
december
28,
1958
or
order
posed
in
the
case
by
the
district
court
on
april
22,
1964.
then
in
1970,
on
august
12,
1970,
the
petitioners
filed
a
motion
to
cite
for
contempt
and
for
relief.
and
in
that
august
12,
1970
motion
they
did
raise
the
issue
of
this
resegregation.
they
raised
the
issue
of
the
ymca
case
which
been
decided
a
month
before.
it
was
pursuant
to
that
hearing
that
these
depositions
were
taken
or
it
was
pursuant
to
that
motion
that
these
depositions
were
taken.
and
that
case
resulted
in
the
joint
filing
of
a
plan
for
extensive
improvement
of
recreational
facilities
throughout
the
city.
montgomery,
as
many
other
communities,
we
had
recreation
facilities
in
one
part
of
town
that
weren't
as
good
as
another.
some
in
the
black
community,
one
is
good
as
some
of
the
white.
some
in
--
some
portions
of
the
white,
one
is
good
in
some
portions
as
the
black,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
city,
by
a
joint
motion
agreed
to
equalize
all
facilities.
we
had
just
finished
a
community
center
at
the
time
the
filing
of
the
petition.
it
was
completed
about
that
time
in
a
lower
income
in
negro
area.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
we
say
facilities
ought
to
be
as
good
as
we
can
possibly
make
them
all
over
town,
we
agreed
to
do
that
and
judge
johnson
approved
this
plan
and
found
that
was
dispositive
of
all
the
issues
before
the
court.
and
that
was
in
december
of
1971
when
the
district
court
said
that
the
joint
plan
disposed
of
all
issues
before
the
court,
and
that
appears
in
the
appendix,
in
the
very
outset
when
the
chronology
of
the
case
is
set
forth.
then,
far
than
that
and
after
all
those
issues
were
disposed
of
in
september
of
1971,
the
petitioners
came
along
and
filed
a
petition
for
supplemental
relief
and
that’s
the
basic
--
basis
of
this
present
proceeding.
now,
the
basis
for
the
supplemental
relief
was
largely,
and
i
think,
a
fair
reading
of
it
discloses
that
it
dealt
with
private
schools
and
private
academies.
let’s
go
for
a
moment
and
look
at
the
depositions
that
mr.
levin
attaches
to
his
reply
brief,
and
he
includes,
and
i
think
very
significantly,
in
this
case.
if
you
look
back
at
those
depositions,
i
skip
from
page
20
to
page
40,
in
some
instances
and
a
whole
lot
of
them
are
omitted.
now,
we
didn’t
have
enough
--
he
didn’t
designate
these
as
part
of
his
appendix
and,
of
course,
we
had
no
opportunity
to
counter
designate
so
we
have
had
delivered
to
the
clerk’s
office
the
entire
deposition.
and,
we’ve
asked
the
court
if
they
deem
these
depositions
--
if
the
court
deems
these
depositions
appropriate
before
the
court,
all
of
them
should
certainly
be
considered.
for
example,
he
talks
about
segregated
babe
ruth,
but
on
page
15
of
a
deposition
of
mr.
mckean
and
he
omitted
this
from
the
part
he
put
back
in
this
addendum.
as
far
as
babe
ruth
is
specific
in
here,
it
says
no
distinction
be
made
between
black
and
white,
absolutely
not.
there
has
never
been
any
distinction
in
as
far
as
babe
ruth
leagues,
nationally
or
from
the
state,
no
distinction
with
regard
to
race.
that’s
omitted
from
what
he’s
got
here,
but
we
have
delivered
it
to
the
clerk’s
office.
mr.
mckean
said
they
put
out
notices
at
all
schools
for
children
who
want
to
play
babe
ruth
or
boys
who
want
to
play
babe
ruth
to
come
and
attend.
dixie
youth,
he
mentioned
that
this
morning,
he
mentioned
that
in
his
addendum.
he
attached
some
depositions
of
a
mr.
marshall,
but
he
didn’t
attach
them
all.
and
the
parts
that
he
didn’t
attach
say
this
on
page
16,
“no
restriction
against
blacks
playing.
all
dixie
youth
leagues
invite
black
boys
to
come
out.
no
boy
is
excluded
because
of
race.”
leagues
formed

for

more

were

and
hopefully
would
come
out
and
in
point
of

they
did.
in
point
of
fact,
babe
ruth
leagues,
athlete
--
athletics
in
montgomery,
alabama
and
throughout
the
state
of
alabama
encouraged
participation
by
all
people
without
regard
to
race
or
color.
alabama,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
proud
of
the
black
athletes.
they
play
for
our
colleges
throughout
the
state.
the
university
of
alabama,
for
example,
has
many,
many
black
players
on
the
starting
basketball
team
that
played
the
university
of
mississippi
the
other
night.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
depositions
that
he
attaches
here
are
not
complete
and
these
were
submitted
in
august
1970
prior
to
the
plaintiffs
and
the
city
agreeing
on
this
joint
plan
for
improvement.
why
were
they
able
to
agree
on
the
joint
plan
for
improvement
and
not
go
into
the
issue
of
“resegregation”
in
their
disposing
of
all
issues?
i
submit
to
you
that
the
depositions
that
were
all
filed
in
the
district
court,
and
were
left
up
high
over
from
what
he
sends
up
here,
establish
why
they
did
that,
because
they
saw
that
there
was
no
distinction
in
this
babe
ruth,
little
league,
or
anywhere
else.
as
far
as
the
city
of
montgomery
is
concerned,
he
attaches
a
deposition
--
parts
of
a
deposition
from
a
mr.
boldman.
what
he
doesn’t
attach
shows
that
there
is
integrative
participation
in
public
recreation
throughout
the
spectrum
of
montgomery
alabama.
football,
basketball,
baseball
are
integrated.
you
have
integrated
teams
playing
integrated
teams
and
predominantly
white
playing
predominantly
black
throughout
on
page
49,
50,
and
56
of
mr.
boldman’s
deposition
which,
significantly,
he
didn’t
attach.
so
we
think,
first,
that
the
issues
--
all
which
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
it
--
it's
an
argument
that
the
depositions
that
he
refers
to
are
establish
that
the
city
of
montgomery
does
not
discriminate
in
recreational
activities
and
programs
because
of
race
or
color
and
it
is
an
argument
too,
sir,
that
this
was
before
the
district
court
in
1970
when
the
district
court
approved
a
joint
motion
for
improvement.
the
issue
was
before
the
court
on
this
alleged
resegregation.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
district
court
in
the
order
forming
the
basis
of
this
appeal,
if
it
please
the
court,
ever
made
no
finding
of
resegregation
and
we
are
saying
to
the
court
that
the
reason
he
made
no
finding
of
resegregation
is
because,
in
point
of
fact,
there
was
none.
he
said
this,
“when
there
joint
improvement
petition
was
approved.”
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
he
rested
the
injunction
on
the
fact
that
the
pure
simple
fact
that
an
all-white
private
school
should
not
be
able
to
use
a
municipal
facility,
one
and
then
secondly
on
the
issue
of
private
organizations,
without
resegregation,
private
organizations
shouldn’t
use
municipal
facilities
if
they
have
a
racially
discriminatory
admissions
policy.
i
don’t
think,
in
the
point
i’m
hoping
to
make
and
maybe
i’m
not
doing
it
too
clearly
here,
is
that
the
issue
of
resegregation
was
not
part
of
the
district
court’s
order.
it
was
not
part
of
the
district
court’s
order.
the
district
court
in
the
order,
they
formed
the
basis
of
this
writ,
found
that
the
city
made
facilities
available
to
all
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
when
he
had
these
depositions
before
him
back
in
1970,
what
did
he
say
when
we
filed
a
joint
motions
for
improvement?
the
district
court
said
it
further
appears
that
the
implementation
of
said
agreement
and
plans
would
dispose
of
all
of
the
issues
involved
in
this
litigation
and
what
were
those
issues?
those
issues
included
the
issue
of
this
alleged
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
i
think
that
tells
us
this.
mr.
levin,
and
on
his
brief,
reply
brief
and
in
this
court,
contends
that
there
has
been
type
of
a
resegregation.
he
says
the
district
court
is
bound
to
have
known
that.
we
state
to
you
that
the
district
court
knew
to
the
contrary
because
of
the
fortunes
of
the
testimony
that
was
already
before
him.
he
knew,
to
the
contrary,
resegregation
didn’t
enter
into
it
as
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
it
was
predicated
on
the
district
court’s
feelings
and
understanding
of
the
law
that
because
a
private
club
had
a
racially
discriminatory
admission
policy,
that
private
club
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
a
public
recreational
facility.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
district
court
intended
to
imply
by
that,
that
the
city
was
guilty
of
any
evasion
of
a
prior
court
order.
as
judge
clark
pointed
out
on
footnote
14
in
the
circuit
court
opinion,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
evasion
of
the
city
responsibility
to
operate
recreational
facilities
on
a
desegregated
basis
by
the
subterfuges
converting
such
facilities
to
private
control.
the
district
court
had
been
presented
with
substance
for
that
finding
and
even
the
plaintiffs
themselves
in
the
fifth
circuit,
on
page
12
of
their
brief
in
the
fifth
circuit,
took
the
position
in
the
fifth
circuit
agree
to
neutrality
on
behalf
of
the
city.
the
fact
that
the
state
officials
have
presented
a
racially
neutral
policy
and
that
the
actual
discrimination
has
occurred
at
the
hands
of
private
individuals,
has
never
been
viewed
by
the
courts
as
a
significant
factor
in
determining
the
constitutionality
of
state
action.
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
purpose
of
my
going
into
this
was
that
that
this
matter
that
we
are
here
today
on
was
not
tried
before
the
district
court
on
an
issue
of
resegregation.
it
was
not
presented
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
an
issue
of
resegregation.
we
submit
to
you
that
it
could
not
have
been
because
such
is
not
defect,
and
we
don’t
go
out
in
thin
air
and
just
say
that
without
support.
we
say
it
is
not
the
fact
because
the
depositions
that
were
actually
before
the
district
court,
as
mr.
levin
pointed
out
earlier,
when
this
issue
was
raised,
they
asked
more
than
just
improvement
in
august
1970.
they
asked
for
contempt
and
they
asked
that
we
would
be
enjoined
from
allowing
these
private
groups
to
do
it.
the
district
court
didn’t
order
that.
he
approved
the
improvement
of
the
facilities
without
finding,
as
mr.
--
judge
clark
said,
“any
involvement
of
the
city’s
responsibility.”
and
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
judge
clark
is
correct,
sir
and
i
think
the
posture
of
the
case
is
--
was
it
--
as
it
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
then
the
district
court
is
such,
that
you
really
could
never
do
it.
they
asked
for
a
broad
spectrum
on
all
the
effect
in
every
private
club
of
every
nature
if
they
got
a
discriminatory
admission
clause.
how
would
you
ever
be
able
to
go
into
the
history,
frequency,
or
effects
of
more
than
100
and
it’s
literally
hundreds
of
private
organizations
that
use
municipal
facilities.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
it
wasn’t
done
in
this
case.
it
was
presented
to
the
district
court
on
a
--
stipulated
facts
that
all
of
the
facilities
were
open
to
all
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
this
case
is
the
proper
vehicle
to
go
down
and
have
a
blanket
order
in
montgomery,
alabama
applying
to
all
types
of
private
clubs
regardless
of
their
size,
regardless
of
the
purpose,
regardless
of
the
frequency
or
use,
a
blanket
order
is
what
judge
clark
says
that
the
--
was
too
broad,
and
i
think
that
that’s
well
supported
by
the
law.
i
think
we
can’t
speculate,
we
can’t
guess
about
the
involvement
going
on.
i
don’t
believe
that’s
what
the
--
this
court
envisioned
in
burton
and
i
think,
as
this
court
said
in
norwood,
you
can’t
just
assume
that
all
of
these
things
are
invidious
and
that’s
what
they
ask
in
this
case
as
an
order,
a
blanket
order
saying
any
club
with
a
discriminatory
admission
policies
can’t
use
municipal
facilities.
we
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
1959
order
ordered
all
facilities
opened
up.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don’t
believe
so,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
feel
strongly
that
it
would
not
have
been
for
several
reasons.
one,
i
the
--
i
don’t
believe
that
the
city
is
under
an
affirmative
duty
to
require
desegregation
in
private
clubs.
and,
secondly,
these
private
clubs,
as
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals,
are
entitled
we
think
now,
as
well
as
then
in
the
periodic
use
of
public
facilities.
they
wouldn’t
found
here
and
they
simply
would
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
as
judge
clark
commented,
no
findings
were
made
on
any
evasion
of
the
city’s
responsibility.
there
weren't
any
findings
that
this
private
clubs
were
a
place
--
a
public
accommodation
or
any
nexus
between
the
private
clubs
and
the
municipality.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
issue
before
judge
johnson,
mr.
justice
marshall,
was
whether
or
not
just
because
a
club
has
admission
policy
that
doesn’t
--
it
excludes
either
whites
or
blacks,
whether
that
in
and
of
itself
would
preclude
that
organization
from
the
use
of
municipal
facilities.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
as
i
under
it,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
the
question
before
you.
i
would
like
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
background,
sir
was
necessitated
or
i
thought
it
was
because
of
this
reply
brief
that
they
filed
last
week
in
which
they
attached
only
portions
of
some
depositions,
and
i
thought
it
appropriate
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
there
was
a
great
deal
more
that
was
brought
out
even
back
then
that
he
didn’t
see
fit
to
include
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
my
going
into
that
portion
of
the
background.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
this
would
--
if
your
honor
please
would
embrace
the
spectrum
from
muslim
to
mormon
with
lion’s
club
and
city
club
and
ladies
garden
clubs
and
bridge
clubs
and
just
everybody,
from
a
group
of
5-500.
it
would
embrace
the
moose
lodge,
the
fraters,
every
conceivable
type
of
private
club,
political,
social,
fraternal,
charitable,
all
or
everybody
as
we
see
it
under
this
order.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
imagine
a
group
would
be
two
or
more
people
that
have
some
type
of
club
relation
between
them,
and
that
would
be
up
to
the
two
or
more
people
to
determine
what
that
was.
i
guess
three
of
us
could
form
a
group.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
not
that
i
can
see,
if
the
court
please.
there’s
nothing
in
his
order
that
discusses
any
type
of
use
or
how
they
go
about
people
and
i
think
judge
clark,
in
the
fifth
circuit
order,
points
that
out.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
this,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
have
to
see,
of
course,
the
--
there
was
an
order
to
prohibit
segregation
in
municipal
recreational
facilities.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
so.
i
think
it
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context
though,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
no
resegregation
has
been
written
to
in
any
stage
and
i
think
the
record
is
barren
of
any
support
of
resegregation.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i’m
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
let
me
say
this.
i
don’t
feel
that
this
present
order
is
even
germane
really
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
--
to
the
1969
order
because
that
opened
everything
up,
and
now
they
have
come
along
and
the
petitioners
ask
that
it
should
be
closed
to
a
particular
group
because
of
the
racial
admissions
policy
of
that
particular
group.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
we
make
no
issue
about
private
schools
in
this
proceeding.
we
don’t
make
that
it’s
even
an
issue.
the
affirmative
duty
on
the
school
boards
and
the
municipality
to
this
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
it
would.
well,
let
me
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i’m
not
sure,
sir.
i’m
not
sure.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
do
not
contest
that.
we
think
that’s
within
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
because
the
city,
as
we
understand
it,
has
no
affirmative
duty
to
maintain
desegregated
or
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir,
and
we
say
we
abide
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright.
i
read
the
1959
order
to
say
open
up
your
recreational
facilities.
open
them
up
without
regard
to
race
or
color.
don’t
keep
any
group
out
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
sir?
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that’s
right,
and
keep
them
open,
and
don’t
turn
a
negro
group
away
or
a
white
group
away.
and,
i
don’t
think
that
the
1959
order
or
any
court
of
this
--
or
any
decision
of
this
court
puts
a
burden
on
a
municipality
to
delve
in
to
the
racial
composition
to
these
groups.
we
think
we
are
in
strict
accord
with
the
1959
order.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
i
think
you
have
to
do
this.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
you
have
to
go
into
the
racial
composition
there
because
it
--
we
have
to
see
that
desegregated
education
is
not
interfered
with
and
not
retarded
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
norwood
versus
harrison.
but
i
don’t
think
that
government
at
any
level
should
be
placed
with
responsibility
of
delving
into
the
membership
policies
of
church
clubs,
social
clubs,
and
political
organizations.
we
think
that
--
we
don’t
plead
that
the
1959
order
of
watson
versus
memphis
or
any
other
decision
requires
us
to
do
that.
now,
i’d
like
to
say
this.
mr.
levin
says
that
montgomery,
alabama
should
be
treated
apart
from
other
parts
of
the
country.
he
says
that,
for
some
reason,
there’s
something
different
about
the
situation
here.
this
community
and
in
this
area
struggled
with
problems
of
desegregation
and
removal
of
discriminatory
practices,
and
we
feel
that
when
we
come
before
this
court
and
say
that
we
are
open,
that
our
facilities
are
open
to
all,
that’s
not
an
empty
promise
or
just
a
statement,
its
documented
by
the
facts
as
they
exist
right
in
montgomery.
for
example,
two
members
of
the
respondent
board
that
are
before
this
court
today
are
black
leaders
in
montgomery.
they
were
appointed
without
any
court
compulsion
and
they’re
there
and
a
part
of
this
case.
a
black
man
is
presently
the
recreation
director
for
the
entire
program.
there
had
been
extensive
construction
of
facilities
throughout
the
city
of
montgomery.
some
by
virtue
of
the
joint
proposal
filed
in
1970
and
1971,
and
some
go
far
beyond
that.
it’s
without
dispute
and
they
don’t
dispute
this
in
their
reply
briefs
that
montgomery
is
commencing
the
construction
of
a
municipal
golf
course
with
swimming
pools
being
opened,
that
will
be
available
to
black
people
and
white
people
and
without
--
everyone
without
regard
to
race
or
color.
there
is
desegregated
participation
in
municipally
sponsored
recreational
activities.
as
pointed
out
in
the
portions
of
the
record
that
he
did
not
include
and
also
in
the
appendix
itself
of
the
--
on
pages
55
and
53.
seventeen
of
those
31
football
games
involved
desegregated
teams
playing
desegregated
teams.
the
august
1st
stipulated
facts
on
which
this
record
is
before
this
court
says
and
states
and
agrees
between
the
parties
that
all
recreational
facilities
throughout
the
city
of
montgomery
are
open
to
all
on
an
equal
basis
with
all
person
to
other
community
have
an
equal
access
thereto
without
regard
to
raise
the
(inaudible).
that’s
not
just
an
empty
statement,
if
the
court
pleases.
it’s
supported
by
the
actual
facts
that
are
living
and
existing
in
montgomery,
alabama
today.
a
comparison
of
the
style
of
this
case,
from
the
appendix
of
how
it
started
out
with
the
parties
that
are
there
now,
show
that
there
had
been
a
complete
change
in
the
park
and
recreation
board.
we’ve
got
a
new
mayor.
we’ve
got
new
members
and
a
biracial
park
and
recreation
board
there
in
montgomery.
the
leadership
now
in
this
area
is
coming
from
biracial
groups.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
he
does.
i
think,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
comment,
that
he
decided
this
case
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
in
irvis.
i
think
he
thought
that
if
a
group
had
a
policy
of
allowing
only
blacks
or
only
whites
in
that
in
that
it's
in
and
if
itself
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
and
what
i
say
to
the
court
is
true.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
these
facts
are
true,
if
the
court
please.
we’ve
got
these
participants
down
there
and
we
state
to
the
court
that
discrimination
in
recreation
in
montgomery,
alabama,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
mentioned
in
the
1969
order,
we
say
we
are
in
strict
compliance
with
it.
any
discrimination
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
montgomery,
alabama
has
been
removed.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
“root
and
branch.”
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
district
court
in
the
order
that’s
before
this
court
made
the
finding
that
the
respondents
allow
all
persons
and
groups
to
use
recreational
facilities
specifically,
and
i
quote,
judge
johnson.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don’t
know,
sir.
i
think
because
he
understood
the
law
to
be
that
we
had
to
go
into
the
racial
composition
and
see
what
kind
of
admissions
policies,
all
the
types
of
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
he
said
this,
and
i
quote,
“the
city
of
montgomery
makes
football,
basketball
and
baseball
facilities
available
to
all
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis
to
private,
to
any
private
groups
who
apply
for
them
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.”
i
agree
with
you,
sir
that
the
district
court
does
know
that
we
have
got
two
black
members
on
the
board
and
it
comes
out
and
publicized
in
the
press
that
a
black
man
is
heading
all
of
the
recreational
programs
throughout
the
city
of
montgomery.
now,
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
this.
they
want
to
use
the
vehicle
of
this
desegregation
case
to
go
into
all
of
the
admissions
policies
of
various
groups
regardless
of
the
size,
composition,
or
purpose
of
the
group.
we
don’t
feel,
in
this
case,
on
remand
or
otherwise
that
this
is
a
proper
vehicle
to
do
it.
the
head
of
a
group
that
they
brought
before
the
court
is
the
ymca,
and
the
court
found
ymca
really
wasn’t
private
because
they
are
all
encompassing
membership
and
therefore,
and
the
connection
that
the
city
and
the
white
cooperating,
an
order
was
entered.
if
they
have
any
examples
that
they
feel
like
the
city
is
using
or
using
the
city
for
subterfuge,
those
part
is
--
they
are
just
--
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
palmer
versus
thompson,
ought
to
be
before
the
court.
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
two
he
mentions
today,
the
babe
ruth
and
the
dixie
league,
are
not
discriminatory
as
is
evidenced
by
the
portions
of
the
depositions
that
he
didn’t
include.
but
this
case
is
not
the
vehicle,
we
respectfully
submit,
to
go
in
and
to
put
a
municipality
on
the
basis
of
defending
its
relation
with
all
types
of
private
groups.
we
think
that
in
burton,
the
court
envisioned
a
shifting
and
analysis
of
circumstances
and
with
the
broad
spectrum
that
they
seek
here,
we
say
that
this
case
is
not
the
vehicle.
as
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
burger
stated
in
norwood
versus
harrison,
no
presumptions
flow
from
mere
allegations.
no
one
can
be
required,
consistent
with
due
process,
to
prove
absence
of
violation
of
the
law.
if
they’ve
got
a
specific,
they’ve
got
judicial
retorts,
but
better
than
that,
better
than
that
if
they’ve
got
something
that
they
feel
like
is
re-segregating,
if
they
will
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
park
and
recreation
board
of
the
city
of
montgomery,
if
they
will
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
biracial
park
and
recreation
board,
i
think
it’ll
be
remedied
and
i
state
that
it‘ll
be
remedied
without
the
necessity
of
judicial
intervention.
i
think
that’s
the
posture
of
this
case.
that’s
the
posture
of
what
montgomery,
alabama
is
trying
to
do.
we’ve
made
progress.
he
says
in
his
brief
“we
applaud
it.”
we
are
proud
of
the
progress
that
we’ve
made.
we
think
that
the
facts
are
undisputed
and
documented
speak
for
themselves
that
public
recreational,
public
recreational
facilities
in
montgomery,
alabama
are
open
to
all
without
regard
to
race
or
color
and
we
ask
this
court
to
allow
us
to
continue
to
keep
them
opened
up.
thank
you.
