justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
get
back,
mr.
levin.
as
i
understand
it,
these
private
segregated
academies
may
not
use
public
football
fields?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
they
couldn't
use
them
at
all,
am
i
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
not
all
of
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
public
high
schools
--
if
a
nonsegregated
public
high
schools
use
the
football
fields
monday,
tuesday,
wednesday,
and
thursday,
under
this
order,
may
a
segregated
academy
use
them
on
friday?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
maybe
i
haven't
read
that
in
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
levin,
you
were
satisfied
with
the
district
court
order,
weren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
is
it
the
court
of
appeals
allows
that
the
district
court
prohibited?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
you
object
to
is
letting
the
private
academies
make
use
of
any
public
facility
where
in
your
view
its
use
contributes
to
the
mission
of
the
private
academy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
for
example,
if
there
is
a
public
park,
with
six
basketball
courts,
i
gather,
in
your
view
the
private
academy
should
not
be
permitted
to
have,
for
example,
one
of
its
teams
practice
on
one
of
those
six
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
now,
but
suppose
just
students
who
attend
the
private
academy
go
and
just
have
a
pickup
team
to
play
them
on
the
courts.
is
that
permitted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
would
you
say
that
should
be
prohibited?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
hypothetical
was
there
was
a
bunch
of
kids,
their
school
day
is
finished
and
they
stop
by
and
they
want
to
have
a
pickup
game
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
a
non-school
connected
then,
that
implies
that
it’s
a
part
of
the
curriculum
of
the
--
a
course
of
instruction
or
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
there’s
any
school
program?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
part
of
the
school
program,
it’s
your
view
that
that
ought
to
be
prohibited?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
too
simple,
mr.
levin?
what
you
think
ought
to
be
held
here
is
that
whether
this
is
a
private
academy
or
a
private
club,
social
club,
or
anything
else
that,
provided
it
has
a
problem
of
segregation,
excluding
negroes,
participation
in
its
affairs
that
in
that
circumstance
no
public
facility
should
be
opened
to
a
no
--
public
recreational
facility
should
be
opened
to
it
for
the
furtherance
of
any
program
of
that
organization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
each
of
the
benefit
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
sewage
system
and
lighting
system.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
don’t
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
school
children
should
be
barred
to
use
of
the
public
streets
to
get
back
and
forth
to
the
private
school,
the
private
segregated
school?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
even
free
milk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i’m
not
sure
that
they
may
--
they
may
not
be
recreational
facilities,
but
don’t
we
have
to
find
something
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
phelps,
i’m
sorry,
i
don’t
know
that
i
follow
you.
are
you
--
is
this
an
argument
that
this
case
has
already
been
settled
between
the
parties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
and
yet,
the
district
court
entered
the
injunction
that
then
was
modified
or
reversed,
as
you
plead,
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
this
--
all
this
material
was
before
the
district
court
in
1970?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
what
then
do
the
rest
of
the
injunction,
judge
johnson?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
phelps,
that
in
light
of
that
finding
that
is
in
itself
enough
to
suggest
error
in
the
injunction
he
granted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
problem
mr.
phelps,
i’m
not
following
it.
i
don’t
quite
understand,
assuming
that
this
is
all
quite
so
and
that
indeed
there
was
no
question
of
resegregation,
nevertheless,
the
district
court
entered
the
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
what
basis?
on
what
was
it
predicated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
this
embrace
a
lady’s
bridge
club?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me
mr.
phelps.
getting
back
to
what
mr.
justice
white
asked
you
earlier.
really,
to
decide
this
case,
doesn’t
one
have
to
go
back
to
the
1959
order
and
it’s
underpinning
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
the
1959
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
might
want
to
look
at
this
19,
what
is
it
1970
or
1971
order
of
judge
johnson
as
simply
a
sequel,
a
supplement,
as
a
further
remedy
to
address
the
situation
that
he
found
in
1959?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
meant
to
suggest
was
and
perhaps
it
doesn’t
stand
up,
but
what
i
meant
to
suggest
was
if
it
were
that
this
later
order
is
simply
a
supplement
to
the
original
order,
then
the
issue
of
re-segregation
is
rather
irrelevant,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
see
what
resegregation
--
if
this
later
order
is
just
a
further
order
adding
to
the
1959
order,
in
order
to
give
effect
to
the
1959
order,
then
this
issue
of
resegregation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
1959
order.
justice
william
j.
