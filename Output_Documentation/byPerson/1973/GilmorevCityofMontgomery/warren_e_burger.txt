we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-1517,
georgia
theresa
gilmore
against
city
of
montgomery.
mr.
levin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when,
what
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
situation
right
now?
what
public
facilities
are
available
to
the
non-public
schools
and
their
students
concerning
which
you
complain?
could
you
just
say
1,
2,
3,
4,
what
they
are?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
focus
on
the
football
fields
and
that's
what
you're
challenging,
that
exclusion
made
by
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical
relating
to
that.
suppose
these
were
not
matters
of
segregated
schools,
but
suppose
you
had
a
catholic
academy
run
by
the
catholic
order.
could,
in
your
view,
judicial
power
enjoin
the
city
from
letting
the
catholic
school
play
on
that
field
because
that
had
a
tendency
to
enhance
the
operations
of
a
church-operated
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
art
galleries?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let’s
suppose
the
academy
--
the
private
segregated
academy
says
that
on
saturday
morning
or
friday
afternoon
the
third
and
the
fourth
grades
will
all
go
to
the
gallery
as
part
of
our
enhancing
--
your
appreciation
of
art.
so
they
can’t
get
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
benefit
to
school
or
benefit
to
students?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
really
distinguish
recreation
from
culture
in
this
context,
that
is,
the
art
gallery,
the
symphony
concerts?
suppose,
for
example,
the
city
maintained
or
engaged
a
symphony
orchestra
to
come
and
play
or
a
ballet
and
they
issued
free
tickets
to
all
the
students
of
public
schools,
but
refused
to
issue
free
tickets
to
students
attending
private
schools.
do
you
think
no
equal
protection
question
would
arise
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
textbooks
are
not
quite
like
art
galleries
and
theaters
because
other
people
and
students
use
them.
these
are
public
facilities
i’m
talking
about,
open
to
the
public
generally.
but
under
the
hypothesis
of
my
question,
the
students
in
the
private
schools
would
be
excluded
because
they
were
students
in
private
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
inoculation
against
contagious
diseases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
pick
up
at
that
point
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
arguments
in
number
1517,
and
mr.
levin,
i
think
you
have
about
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
i
understood
you
correctly
yesterday
counsel,
and
perhaps
this
could
be
cleared
up.
if
five
or
six
young
men
or
11
young
men
came
down
individually
to
play
football
or
volleyball
or
whatever,
they
could
come
in.
but
if
they
came
down
in
the
uniforms
of
the
private
school
playing
in
connection
with
an
intramural
athletic
program,
they
could
not
use
the
facility,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
levin.
mr.
phelps.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
task
here,
mr.
phelps,
if
i
may
say
so,
is
to
defend
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
modification
of
judge
johnson’s
order
and
i
think
perhaps
some
of
us
have
been
confused
as
to
why
this
background,
or
how
it
related
closely
at
least
to
the
modification
made
by
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
phelps,
the
electronic
system
is
not
functioning
again
today.
you
have
two
minutes
left.
there
won’t
be
any
light
signal.
chief

e.

you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
