--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
where
judge
clark
said
the
district
court
made
no
findings
about
the
history,
frequency,
or
effects
of
public
creation
--
recreational
facilities
by
such
non-school
affiliated
private
organizations.
furthermore,
in
this
case
which
was
tried
on
stipulated
facts,
nothing
was
stipulated
which
would
support
this
prong
of
the
injunction.
i
went
back
over
the
--
your
motion
for
supplemental
relief,
your
stipulation.
the
answer
is
to
interact
(inaudible)
would
incline
agree
with
judge
clark’s
observation
and
i
would
think
if
that’s
the
case,
you
never
reach
a
constitutional
question
on
your
so-called
second
prong,
the
non-school
related
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
simply
--
the
fifth
circuit
could’ve
reversed
that
prong
of
the
--
simply
because
the
traditional
grounds
for
an
injunction,
whether
you
got
a
constitutional
violation
or
any
other
violation,
are
not
made
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what’s
your
answer
to
judge
clark’s
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
no
showing,
no
indication
at
all
as
i
read
as
to
what
the
policies
of
these
groups
were
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
they
had
open
admissions
or
didn’t
say
much
about
it
or
what.
that
issue
was
really
never
focused
on
in
your
pleadings,
i
thought,
or
--
nor
really
by
the
district
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
stipulation
was
to
submit
on
the
stipulation
of
facts,
the
answers
to
interrogatories
in
the
pleadings
without
any
reference
to
prior
hearings
in
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
reached
the
constitutional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn’t
it
--
it
wouldn’t
exist
if
this
court
affirmed
that
prong
of
the
fifth
circuit’s
judgment,
not
on
the
basis
which
the
fifth
circuit
had,
but
on
the
grounds
that
no
showing
of
an
equitable
nature
was
made
out
to
support
such
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phelps,
what’s
your
position
with
respect
to
the
footnote
12
in
judge
clark’s
opinion?
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that
the
district
court
made
no
findings
about
history,
frequency,
or
effects
of
public
recreational
facility
used
by
such
non-school
affiliated
organizations?

on

facts.
nothing
was
stipulated
which
would
support
this
prong
of
the
injunction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
i
understand
judge
clark,
he
is
saying,
you
know
even
if
you
could
have
done
that
or
even
if
you
could
have
done
it
by
a
representative
sampling,
in
fact,
they
didn’t
do
it
in
this
case,

you

your
opponents?
