a.
blackmun
mr.
coleman,
i
realize
you’re
not
relying
exclusively
on
the
1972
act
by
any
means.
i
suppose
had
a
final
order
been
entered
here
prior
to
the
enactment
of
that
statute,
that
ground
would’ve
been
taken
away,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
by
the
fortuitous
circumstance
that
the
final
order
is
not
entered,
at
least
you
have
an
additional
ground
for
your
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
statute
capable
of
being
applied
to
services
rendered
after
its
effective
date?
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
it
applies
to
all
circumstances
as
long
as
the
statute
is
applicable?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it
is
still
another
chapter
in
the
rather
protracted
litigation
resulting
--
relating
really
to
the
segregation
and
desegregation
of
the
richmond,
virginia
public
school.
in
may
1971,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
awarded
the
negro
plaintiffs,
who
are
the
petitioners
here,
expenses
and
attorney’s
fees
for
services
rendered
from
march
1970
to
january
29,
1971.
on
the
earlier
of
those
dates,
the
petitioners
had
moved
for
additional
relief
under
the
green
case
decided
here
two
years
previously
which
held
that
a
freedom-of-choice
plan,
like
the
one
previously
approved
for
the
richmond
schools
and
then
in
effect,
was
no
longer
acceptable,
where
other
methods
for
conversion
to
a
unitary
system
were
reasonably
available.
negotiations
on
a
number
of
hearings
followed.
in
april
1971,
the
district
court
approved
a
third
plan
proposed
by
the
school
board,
and
shortly
thereafter,
they
allowed
the
expenses
and
fees
that
are
now
an
issue.
the
court
predicated
its
ruling
on
the
ground
that
the
actions
taken
by
the
board
had
resulted
in
an
unreasonable
delay
in
desegregation
and
that
the
plaintiffs
were
properly
acting
as
private
attorney’s
general.
after
the
case
had
been
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
had
been
heard
there,
but
before
the
appeal
had
been
decided,
the
congress
enacted
the
education
amendments
act
of
1972.
section
718
of
that
act
granted
a
federal
court
authority
to
award
that
prevailing
party
in
a
school
desegregation
case,
a
reasonable
attorney’s
fee,
when
appropriate,
upon
the
entry
of
a
final
order.
thus,
the
statute
came
into
been
after
the
period
for
which
fees
were
awarded
here
and
after
the
award
had
been
made
by
the
district
court,
but
before
the
disposition
of
the
appeal.
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
and
disallowed
the
award
holding
that
the
statutory
conditions
have
not
been
satisfied,
and
thus
that
the
statute
could
not
be
used.
it
also
rejected
the
other
equitable
grounds
proposed
in
the
support
of
the
award.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
new
statute
may
be
applied
that
cover
attorney’s
services
rendered
before
the
statute
was
enacted
and
when
the
issue
of
the
propriety
of
the
award
was
pending
resolution
on
appeal.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
we
rely
on
the
established
principle
that
an
appellate
court
is
to
apply
the
law
in
affect
at
the
time
it
renders
its
decision.
this
has
its
foundation
in
a
case
called
united
states
against
schooner
peggy
decided
here
almost
175
years
ago
with
an
opinion
written
by
chief
justice
marshall.
that
case
draws
some
exceptions
to
the
rule,
but
we
conclude
that
it
does
--
with
this
case,
does
not
fit
those
exceptions.
we
hold
furthermore
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
correct
when
it
held
that
the
technical
requirements
of
the
new
statute
were
not
fulfilled
in
this
case.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
as
we
have
directed.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
powell

consideration
or

of
this
case.
