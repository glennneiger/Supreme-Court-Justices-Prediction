mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
is
a
propriety
under
section
718
of
the
1972
school
aid
act
or
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
related
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
rights
act
statutes
and
the
reversal
by
the
fourth
circuit
of
the
district
court’s
award
of
counsel
fees
for
petitioners’
successful
efforts
in
obtaining
an
injunction
which
required
the
richmond
school
board
to
adhere
to
its
constitutional
and
statutory
duty
to
desegregate
its
public
schools.
the
issue
tendered
here
predates
and
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
subsequent
richmond
area
school
case
which
this
court
heard
last
term.
petitioners
here
are
black
school
children
and
their
parents
who
live
in
richmond
and
who
were
required
to
return
to
the
district
court
on
march
10,
1970
to
force
respondents
to
adopt
an
effective
desegregation
plan.
i
say
“required”
because
on
may
30,
1966,
after
five
years
of
litigation,
the
school
board
had
proposed
and
the
district
court
had
ordered
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
for
the
1966
school
year.
such
plan,
however,
specifically
provided
and
i
call
your
attention
to
page
23
of
the
record
that
if
such
plan
did
not
produce
sufficient
results
--
significant
results
during
the
1966-1967
school
year,
it
would
have
to
be
modified.
the
plan
also
provided
for
desegregation
of
the
school
faculty.
moreover,
on
may
26,
1968,
this
court
decided
greene
which
held
that
freedom
of
choice
plans
which
did
not
result
in
a
unitary
school
system
were
unconstitutional.
the
schools
in
richmond,
both
pupils
and
faculty,
however,
despite
the
1966
plan
and
despite
greene,
remained
non-unitary,
respondents
did
nothing
whatsoever.
so,
finally,
on
march
10,
1970,
petitioners
were
forced
to
move
in
the
district
court
for
further
relief.
the
motion
included
a
request
for
counsel
fees.
the
motion,
after
extensive
litigation
resulted
in
the
school
desegregation
order
of
april
5,
1971,
incidentally
is
the
order
under
which
the
schools
in
richmond
are
now
being
operated.
the
school
--
the
district
court
then,
as
part
of
the
equitable
relief,
awarded
counsel
fees
for
petitioners
of
$43,000
and
costs
of
$13,000.
before
making
this
award,
the
district
court
determined
that,
on
the
record
before
it,
the
award
was
justified
by
respondent's
conduct
both
in
making
necessary
petitioners’
1970
reopening
of
the
case
and
in
the
course
of
the
litigation
thereafter.
ultimately,
the
court
held
that
the
fee
award
was
justified
by
the
fact
that
petitioners
had
acted
as
private
attorneys
general
in
securing
respondent's
compliance
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
such
award
was
required
to
give
complete
and
effective
equitable
relief.
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
findings
of
fact
from
which
the
district
court
order
was
based.
at
page
133a
of
the
record,
the
court
found
that
since
1968,
at
the
latest,
the
school
board
was
clearly
in
default
of
its
constitutional
duties
to
take
steps
which
would
result
in
a
unitary
school
system
that,
when
brought
into
court,
even
though
the
school
board
admitted
noncompliance,
it
put
petitioners
to
the
effort
of
showing
that
governmental
action
was
behind
the
segregated
school
attendants
prevailing
in
richmond,
that’s
at
page
115a
of
the
record
and
page
133a
of
the
record.
the
trial
judge
further
found
that
respondents
would
take
no
steps
whatsoever
to
end
segregation
in
richmond
unless
and
until
sued
by
petitioners
and
then,
only
as
ordered
by
the
district
court,
and
that’s
the
finding
on
page
133a
of
the
record
and
134a
of
the
record.
the
counsel
fee
award
was
based
in
part
upon
these
findings.
thus,
we
do
not
understand
the
observation
of
the
fourth
circuit,
on
page
167a
of
the
record,
that
the
district
court
does
not
seem
to
have
based
its
award
on
the
inaction
of
the
school
board
prior
to
march
10,
1970.
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
first
two
plans
of
desegregation
which
were
filed
by
respondents
as
a
result
of
the
court
order
were
clearly
deficient.
that
finding
is
on
page
117a
--
116a
of
the
record
and
that
two
out
of
the
three
subsequent
plans
filed
by
the
respondents
were
clearly
deficient.
thus,
time
and
effort
was
spent
by
petitioners
in
demonstrating
the
invalidity
of
the
proposed
plans
until,
finally,
the
court
accepted
plan
3.
finally,
and
this
finding
i
think
is
quite
important,
the
district
court
found
that
the
character
of
school
desegregation
cases
by
1970
and
1971
had
become
such
that
full
and
appropriate
equitable
relief
should
include
the
award
of
expenses
of
litigation,
that
finding,
sir,
is
made
on
page
137a
of
the
record.
and
that
counsel
of
great
expertise
was
needed
to
aid
the
court,
and
that
finding
is
on
page
141a
of
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals,
nevertheless,
reversed
the
award
of
counsel
fees.
petitioners
submit
that
there
are
five
separate
and
distinct
legal
grounds,
each
of
which
required
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reinstated.
first,
this
court’s
decision
in
the
mills
case
and
in
the
hall
case,
cited
on
pages
21
and
23
of
our
record
--
of
our
brief,
permit
legal
fees
to
be
awarded
because
petitioners’
actions
benefited
and
ascertainable
class,
namely,
the
school
--
all
of
the
school
children
in
richmond.
second,
petitioners
are
entitled
to
counsel
fees
because
they
acted
as
private
attorney
general
in
bringing
this
action
which
vindicated
important
constitutional
and
constitutional
--
and
congressional
policy.
third,
section
718
of
the
school
aid
act
of
1972
which
we
cite
on
page
--
which
we
set
forth
in
page
8
of
our
brief,
enacted
while
this
case
was
pending
on
appeal,
expressly
requires
the
award
of
counsel
fees
in
school
desegregation
litigation.
fourth,
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court,
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity
to
award
counsel
fees
as
necessary
to
ford
full
complete
equitable
relief
in
this
particular
school
desegregation
case.
and,
finally,
the
legal
fees
here
were
required
by
the
district
court’s
findings
supported
by
the
record
that
the
respondents
unreasonably
--
acted
unreasonably
in
refusing
to
desegregate
voluntarily,
the
richmond
schools
system
and
he
persistently
proposing
a
series
of
unworkable
desegregation
plans.
it
should
be
noted
that
only
the
fifth
ground
requires
consideration
of
whether,
as
the
district
court
found,
respondents’
conduct
was
unreasonably
obstinate.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
it
never
would’ve
existed.
if
what
you’re
saying
by
final
order,
your
honor,
that
the
award
of
counsel
fees
had
been
denied,
an
appeal
was
taken,
and
that
was
denied
and
thereafter,
congress
enacted
a
statute
and,
clearly
that
statute
would
not
applicable.
you
could
not
go
back
and
reopen
the
litigation
on
the
counsel
fees.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
wouldn’t
use
the
word
“fortuitous,”
i
say
by
the
correct
and
saying
that
congress
did
that
that
is
an
additional
ground.
it
would
easily
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
why
don’t
i
go
right
to
section
718?
it’s
on
page
8
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
as
we
understand
it,
section
18
says
that
where
there
is
a
final
order
to
desegregate
the
schools
and
there’s
a
finding
of
fact
that
proceedings
were
necessary
to
bring
about
the
compliance,
then
the
court
may
award
counsel
fees
to
the
prevailing
party,
that
statute
was
enacted
on
either
june
or
july
27,
1972.
it
was
enacted
while
the
case
was
pending
on
appeal.
there
is
nothing
in
that
statute
which
says
it’s
not
to
apply
to
existing
litigation.
as
we
read
your
decision,
particularly
for
us
alabama,
the
one
thing
[attempt
to
laughter]
that’s
clear
is
that
where
you
have
a
statute
which
does
not,
by
its
term,
restrict
itself
to
future
events,
that
statute
pertains
to
pending
litigation.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that’s
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that’s
right.
pardon?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
normally,
that’s
the
rule.
i
mean,
in
the
absence
of
something
extraordinary
that’s
the
rule.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave,
your
honor,
yes.
i
mean,
i
could
see
circumstances
where
the
rule
may
be
different,
but
if
that’s
all
to
the
hypothetical,
i
would
say,
in
that
case,
you
would
apply
the
statute.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
sure.
i
mean,
this
case,
your
honor,
you
have
to
overrule
10-12
cases
before
you
could
say
that
this
statute
would
not
be
applicable.
now,
the
only
thing
that
the
respondents
said,
the
only
argument
he
has
because
the
statute
has
an
effective
date
which
says
in
respect
of
july
1,
1972,
but
obviously
that
was
before
the
case
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit,
before
you
heard
the
case
in
this
court.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
legislative
history,
my
understanding
of
the
law,
your
honor,
is
if
the
legislative
history
is
neutral,
then
clearly
the
rule
of
thought
applies,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
legislative
history,
the
only
legislative
history
that
you
can
find
here
is
that,
at
one
time,
the
bill
specifically
provided
that
it
would
only
be
applicable
to
legal
services
performed
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
that
was
then
deleted
from
the
bill.
now,
to
the
extent
that
there’s
any
legislation,
that’s
it
and
also,
and
i
will
be
finished
with
this
report,
your
honor,
if
you
recall
in
goldstein
versus
california
which
was
decided
last
term,
mr.
chief
justice
when
you
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court,
you
spent
two
paragraphs
completely
twice
quoting
language
which
showed
congress
there
intended
specifically
only
to
apply
the
statute
in
the
future.
and,
it
was
clear
that
but
for
that
specific
language,
you
then
would
apply
that
statute
to
the
action
that
already
took
place.
and
not
only
under
718,
your
honor,
do
i
think
that
this
case
has
to
be
reversed
and
the
order
of
the
district
court
reinstated,
but
under
your
decision
in
hall
where
you
said
that,
there,
there
was
simply
a
congressional
statute
which
said
that
if
an
employee,
if
a
member
of
the
labor
union
was
kicked
out
of
the
union,
he
could
sue.
that
you
indicated
there
that
part
of
the
relief
since
what
he
did
was
an
ascertainable
class,
part
of
the
relief
could
be
the
reward
of
counsel
fee
and,
once
again,
the
district
court
awarded
the
counsel
fee
and
the
sole
issue
was
whether
you
should
upset
it.
the
issue
is
not
here
whether
if
they
had
not
awarded
the
counsel
fee,
what
would
be
the
result.
here,
you
have
a
case
where
the
court
did
exercise
the
power.
in
addition,
the
cases
make
it
clear
that
where
the
petitioner
acts
as
a
private
attorney
general,
he’s
entitled
to
counsel
fee
as
part
of
the
award.
and
the
one
thing
is
clear
and
it’s
contrary
that
private
persons
were
forced
to
bring
lawsuits
to
vindicate
constitutional
rights
which
resulted
in
the
desegregation
of
public
schools.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
piggie
park,
there’s
the
lee
case
in
the
fifth
circuit.
there
are
other
cases
which
say
that
where
it
happens
and
the
government,
here
in
its
amicus
brief,
freely
concedes
that
it
just
did
not
and
could
not
bring
the
litigation
which
resulted
in
the
desegregation
of
public
school
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
certainly
were
vindicating
the
rights
of
a
private
person.
now,
as
i
understand
the
respondent’s
brief,
he
pretty
much
concedes
that
if
you
read
mills,
if
you
read
hall,
if
you
read
the
private
attorney
general’s
cases
that
clearly
the
law
should
be,
that
under
those
circumstances
the
black
petitioners
were
entitled
to
counsel
fee.
but
he
says
that
because
congress
has
now
passed
section
718,
for
some
reason,
you
forget
the
one
group
of
people
that
stood
in
the
trenches,
that
took
the
risk
that
supplied
the
legal
talent
to
change
the
society
peacefully
and
by
the
use
of
law
rather
than
by
being
in
the
street
and
somehow,
they
should
be
penalized.
we
also
think
that
some
urge
in
the
government’s
position
that
the
best
thing
here
for
the
court,
for
all
courts,
is
to
award
the
fee
under
the
basis
of
the
hall
case
of
the
private
attorney
general
because
the
district
courts
and,
frankly,
we
don’t
like
to
be
in
litigation
with
school
boards
as
to
whether
they
were
obstinate
or
not.
now,
if
you
really
want
to
have
a
lot
of
litigation,
that’s
the
only
rule
you
would
go
for,
but
if
you’d
go
for
the
hall
rule
or
the
mills
rule
or
if
you
apply
section
718,
then
you
don’t
have
this
problem.
now,
on
the
being
obstinate,
i
think
the
findings
of
that
and
if
rule
52
needs
anything,
i
think
you
have
to
carryout
the
rule
of
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
after
all,
it
was
judge
marriage
who
dealt
day
and
day
with
the
litigants,
day
in
and
day
out.
he
was
the
one
that
knew
nuances
of
how
cooperative
you’ve
been,
the
things
which
you
just
can’t
put
in
the
record.
and,
he
was
the
one
that
made
the
determination
that
based
upon
everything
that
had
happened
before
him,
he
felt
the
award
should
be
made
on
that
basis.
he
also
was
the
one,
and
i
think
you
ought
to
give
some
weight
to
the
experiences
of
these
great
federal
district
judges
that
have
really
worked
this
problem
out
locally,
that
he
was
the
one
that
having
these
cases
and
knowing
cases,
talk
to
his
brother
who
i’m
pretty
sure,
realized
that
the
effort
involved
in
bringing
this
type
of
litigation
requires
there
to
be
competent
counsel.
counsel
has
to
be
skilled,
a
counsel
has
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
since
that
you
are
defending
the
public
here,
that
for
that
reason
you
ought
to
award
the
counsel
fee.
i
think
brown
number
two,
if
it
teaches
anything,
it
teaches
that
in
this
type
of
litigation
that
sometimes
the
rights
of
the
individual
have
to
be
subordinated
to
the
rights
of
the
entire
group.
and
that
clearly,
by
bringing
in
litigation
and
having
a
class
action,
you
are
functioning
to
change
the
whole
society.
and,
if
the
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
have
any
significance
at
all,
it
is
clear
that
in
this
instance
that
you
ought
to
indicate
that
there
is
--
that
we
were
functioning
as
a
private
or
mr.
greenberg
and
the
other
people
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
were
functioning
as
private
attorney
generals
and
on
that
basis,
you
should
reinstate
the
order
of
the
district
court.
thank
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
i’ve
read
a
lot
of
cases
of
this
court
and
i
stand
--
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
case
where
you’ve
used
this
obdurate
obstinacy
rule.
secondly,
the
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
obdurate
obstinacy
rule.
i
just
never
heard
it
in
any
of
your
opinions,
i’ve
never
read
it.
secondly,
what
really
happened
was,
in
several
cases
where
the
district
court
for
some
reason
denied
relief,
based
upon
the
findings
court
of
equity,
and
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
you
should
reverse
the
district
court
and
that’s
when
this
expression
appeared
in
a
couple
of
opinions.
thirdly,
there
have
been
very
few
cases
that
made
an
award
and,
in
the
bradley
case,
as
early,
the
award
was
$75.
now,
while
we
were
or
while
mr.
lucas
and
mrs.
chachkin
was
litigating
against
the
richmond
school
board,
it
so
happened
that
the
lawyer
for
the
richmond
school
board
for
the
same
period
of
time
received
fees
in
excess
of
$86,000.
this
is
public
money
from
a
school
system
with
60%
black,
40%
white.
clearly,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
blacks
were
violated.
it
is
only
fair
to
be
equitable
when
the
lawsuit
was
finally
successfully
won,
that
those
who
fought
the
school
board
ought
to
be
compensated.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
can
i
come
to
that
because
this
is
something
that
mr.
little,
who’s
a
very
skillful
advocate,
have
said
and
he
successfully
convinced
the
fourth
circuit
of
this.
judge
marriage
entered
the
order
of
april
5,
1971,
based
upon
the
state
of
law
in
his
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
which
had
decided
swan.
he
did
not
wait
for
your
opinion
and,
obviously,
he
couldn’t
determine
what
would
be
in
this
court
opinion
a
year
later
and
if
there’s
any
doubt
about
this,
i’d
like
to
call
your
attention
to
footnote
1
of
his
opinion.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
he
first
indicated
that
because,
since
by
1968
anyone
that
could
read
or
write
knew
that
the
richmond
school
board
was
violating
the
constitution
and
nobody
did
anything,
these
litigants
were
forced
to
come
into
court.
and,
in
part,
his
award
is
based
upon
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
sure,
they
had
to
do
something.
and,
certainly,
what
you
did,
depending
upon
the
local
situation,
the
sincerity,
and
the
sophistication
of
the
school
board,
but,
what
he
says
is
if
you
take
the
law
as
it
existed
in
my
circuit
in
1970-1971,
the
school
board
did
not
discharge
its
functions.
and
his
opinion,
when
you
read
his
opinion
which
is
the
order
of
april
5,
1971,
you
will
find
where
he
states
“i’ve
been
told
to
hold
this
case
until
after
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
decides
swan,
but
i’m
not
going
to
do
that.
i’m
going
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
the
existing
law.”
so,
every
one
of
these
plans
he
threw
out,
he
threw
out
solely
because
it
did
not
comply
with
the
law
of
the
fourth
circuit.
he
did
not
throw
it
out
because
he
felt,
that
he
knew
that
a
year
later
you
were
going
to
decide
a
case
where
you
would
expand
the
rights
of
the
party.
now
in
closing,
your
honor,
on
this
question
of
the
applicability
of
section
718,
i
know
that
every
rule
about
appellate
arguments
says
one
thing
you
don’t
do
is
read
from
a
court
opinion.
but,
i
just
would
call
your
attention
to
the
thorpe
case
where
the
court
says
that
the
general
rule,
however,
is
that
an
appellate
court
must
apply
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
it
renders
its
decision.
then,
in
footnote
38,
a
change
in
the
law
between
a
--
apply,
and
appellate
decision
requires
the
appellate
court
to
apply
the
changed
law.
now,
that
is
the
law
and
as
i
understand
the
decision
of
this
court,
unless
the
respondents
can
point
to
a
legislative
history
or
specific
words
as
existed
in
goldstein
which
says
you
don’t
apply
to
pending
cases,
you
clearly
comply
to
the
pending
case.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
the
legislative
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that’s
right.
unless
you
--
if
you
were
--
if
there’s
a
grave
injustice
and
if
you
talk
about
the
presumption
of
congress,
which
i
--
i’ve
never
used
congress,
but
i
always
felt
that
it’s
conceding
that
congressmen
reads
every
case
and
knows
every
statute,
anything
he
does,
he
knows
the
law.
and,
therefore,
that
you
think
that
those
congressmen
had
read
and
knew
the
obstinate
rule
which
existed
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuits.
when
we
read
those
cases,
i’m
pretty
sure
you’re
convinced
there
is
no
rule,
that’
the
theory
you’re
going
to
go
on,
which
i
really
think
is,
you
know,
it
just
isn’t
so.
congressmen
just
don’t
read
all
the
cases
and
they
don’t
have
time,
but
the
rule
which
is
certainly
one
that
any
legislature
ought
to
know
is
that
when
there’s
a
federal
statute
enacted,
that
that
statute
will
apply
to
existing
cases
unless
congress
goes
out
of
its
way
to
demonstrate
that
that
general
rule
is
not
to
be
applied.
now,
if
you
got
to
compete
between
which
presumption
you
should
take
of
congress,
i
think
that
that
has
to
be
the
presumption
because
that
is
the
law
in
the
federal
cases
and
it
seems
to
me,
on
that
basis,
you
should
apply
section718.
if
you
do
it,
you
avoid
a
lot
of
litigation.
it
becomes
very
simple
and
concise.
you
don’t
have
this
problem
and
i
can
understand
why
a
school
board
would
not
want
to
be
labeled
with
what
it
should
be
labeled
as,
namely,
that
the
fact
it
did
deny
the
right
to
these
black
children
and
it
took
a
lot
of
litigation
and
we
finally
converted
them.
but,
we
converted
them
three
or
four
years
later
and
while
we
were
in
there
and
trying
to
convert
them,
i
think
that
we’re
entitled
to
counsel
fees.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
is
a
propriety
under
section
718
of
the
1972
school
aid
act
or
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
related
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
rights
act
statutes
and
the
reversal
by
the
fourth
circuit
of
the
district
court’s
award
of
counsel
fees
for
petitioners’
successful
efforts
in
obtaining
an
injunction
which
required
the
richmond
school
board
to
adhere
to
its
constitutional
and
statutory
duty
to
desegregate
its
public
schools.
the
issue
tendered
here
predates
and
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
subsequent
richmond
area
school
case
which
this
court
heard
last
term.
petitioners
here
are
black
school
children
and
their
parents
who
live
in
richmond
and
who
were
required
to
return
to
the
district
court
on
march
10,
1970
to
force
respondents
to
adopt
an
effective
desegregation
plan.
i
say
“required”
because
on
may
30,
1966,
after
five
years
of
litigation,
the
school
board
had
proposed
and
the
district
court
had
ordered
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
for
the
1966
school
year.
such
plan,
however,
specifically
provided
and
i
call
your
attention
to
page
23
of
the
record
that
if
such
plan
did
not
produce
sufficient
results
--
significant
results
during
the
1966-1967
school
year,
it
would
have
to
be
modified.
the
plan
also
provided
for
desegregation
of
the
school
faculty.
moreover,
on
may
26,
1968,
this
court
decided
greene
which
held
that
freedom
of
choice
plans
which
did
not
result
in
a
unitary
school
system
were
unconstitutional.
the
schools
in
richmond,
both
pupils
and
faculty,
however,
despite
the
1966
plan
and
despite
greene,
remained
non-unitary,
respondents
did
nothing
whatsoever.
so,
finally,
on
march
10,
1970,
petitioners
were
forced
to
move
in
the
district
court
for
further
relief.
the
motion
included
a
request
for
counsel
fees.
the
motion,
after
extensive
litigation
resulted
in
the
school
desegregation
order
of
april
5,
1971,
incidentally
is
the
order
under
which
the
schools
in
richmond
are
now
being
operated.
the
school
--
the
district
court
then,
as
part
of
the
equitable
relief,
awarded
counsel
fees
for
petitioners
of
$43,000
and
costs
of
$13,000.
before
making
this
award,
the
district
court
determined
that,
on
the
record
before
it,
the
award
was
justified
by
respondent's
conduct
both
in
making
necessary
petitioners’
1970
reopening
of
the
case
and
in
the
course
of
the
litigation
thereafter.
ultimately,
the
court
held
that
the
fee
award
was
justified
by
the
fact
that
petitioners
had
acted
as
private
attorneys
general
in
securing
respondent's
compliance
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
such
award
was
required
to
give
complete
and
effective
equitable
relief.
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
findings
of
fact
from
which
the
district
court
order
was
based.
at
page
133a
of
the
record,
the
court
found
that
since
1968,
at
the
latest,
the
school
board
was
clearly
in
default
of
its
constitutional
duties
to
take
steps
which
would
result
in
a
unitary
school
system
that,
when
brought
into
court,
even
though
the
school
board
admitted
noncompliance,
it
put
petitioners
to
the
effort
of
showing
that
governmental
action
was
behind
the
segregated
school
attendants
prevailing
in
richmond,
that’s
at
page
115a
of
the
record
and
page
133a
of
the
record.
the
trial
judge
further
found
that
respondents
would
take
no
steps
whatsoever
to
end
segregation
in
richmond
unless
and
until
sued
by
petitioners
and
then,
only
as
ordered
by
the
district
court,
and
that’s
the
finding
on
page
133a
of
the
record
and
134a
of
the
record.
the
counsel
fee
award
was
based
in
part
upon
these
findings.
thus,
we
do
not
understand
the
observation
of
the
fourth
circuit,
on
page
167a
of
the
record,
that
the
district
court
does
not
seem
to
have
based
its
award
on
the
inaction
of
the
school
board
prior
to
march
10,
1970.
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
first
two
plans
of
desegregation
which
were
filed
by
respondents
as
a
result
of
the
court
order
were
clearly
deficient.
that
finding
is
on
page
117a
--
116a
of
the
record
and
that
two
out
of
the
three
subsequent
plans
filed
by
the
respondents
were
clearly
deficient.
thus,
time
and
effort
was
spent
by
petitioners
in
demonstrating
the
invalidity
of
the
proposed
plans
until,
finally,
the
court
accepted
plan
3.
finally,
and
this
finding
i
think
is
quite
important,
the
district
court
found
that
the
character
of
school
desegregation
cases
by
1970
and
1971
had
become
such
that
full
and
appropriate
equitable
relief
should
include
the
award
of
expenses
of
litigation,
that
finding,
sir,
is
made
on
page
137a
of
the
record.
and
that
counsel
of
great
expertise
was
needed
to
aid
the
court,
and
that
finding
is
on
page
141a
of
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals,
nevertheless,
reversed
the
award
of
counsel
fees.
petitioners
submit
that
there
are
five
separate
and
distinct
legal
grounds,
each
of
which
required
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
reinstated.
first,
this
court’s
decision
in
the
mills
case
and
in
the
hall
case,
cited
on
pages
21
and
23
of
our
record
--
of
our
brief,
permit
legal
fees
to
be
awarded
because
petitioners’
actions
benefited
and
ascertainable
class,
namely,
the
school
--
all
of
the
school
children
in
richmond.
second,
petitioners
are
entitled
to
counsel
fees
because
they
acted
as
private
attorney
general
in
bringing
this
action
which
vindicated
important
constitutional
and
constitutional
--
and
congressional
policy.
third,
section
718
of
the
school
aid
act
of
1972
which
we
cite
on
page
--
which
we
set
forth
in
page
8
of
our
brief,
enacted
while
this
case
was
pending
on
appeal,
expressly
requires
the
award
of
counsel
fees
in
school
desegregation
litigation.
fourth,
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court,
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity
to
award
counsel
fees
as
necessary
to
ford
full
complete
equitable
relief
in
this
particular
school
desegregation
case.
and,
finally,
the
legal
fees
here
were
required
by
the
district
court’s
findings
supported
by
the
record
that
the
respondents
unreasonably
--
acted
unreasonably
in
refusing
to
desegregate
voluntarily,
the
richmond
schools
system
and
he
persistently
proposing
a
series
of
unworkable
desegregation
plans.
it
should
be
noted
that
only
the
fifth
ground
requires
consideration
of
whether,
as
the
district
court
found,
respondents’
conduct
was
unreasonably
obstinate.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
it
never
would’ve
existed.
if
what
you’re
saying
by
final
order,
your
honor,
that
the
award
of
counsel
fees
had
been
denied,
an
appeal
was
taken,
and
that
was
denied
and
thereafter,
congress
enacted
a
statute
and,
clearly
that
statute
would
not
applicable.
you
could
not
go
back
and
reopen
the
litigation
on
the
counsel
fees.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
i
wouldn’t
use
the
word
“fortuitous,”
i
say
by
the
correct
and
saying
that
congress
did
that
that
is
an
additional
ground.
it
would
easily
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
why
don’t
i
go
right
to
section
718?
it’s
on
page
8
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
as
we
understand
it,
section
18
says
that
where
there
is
a
final
order
to
desegregate
the
schools
and
there’s
a
finding
of
fact
that
proceedings
were
necessary
to
bring
about
the
compliance,
then
the
court
may
award
counsel
fees
to
the
prevailing
party,
that
statute
was
enacted
on
either
june
or
july
27,
1972.
it
was
enacted
while
the
case
was
pending
on
appeal.
there
is
nothing
in
that
statute
which
says
it’s
not
to
apply
to
existing
litigation.
as
we
read
your
decision,
particularly
for
us
alabama,
the
one
thing
[attempt
to
laughter]
that’s
clear
is
that
where
you
have
a
statute
which
does
not,
by
its
term,
restrict
itself
to
future
events,
that
statute
pertains
to
pending
litigation.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that’s
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that’s
right.
pardon?
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
normally,
that’s
the
rule.
i
mean,
in
the
absence
of
something
extraordinary
that’s
the
rule.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave,
your
honor,
yes.
i
mean,
i
could
see
circumstances
where
the
rule
may
be
different,
but
if
that’s
all
to
the
hypothetical,
i
would
say,
in
that
case,
you
would
apply
the
statute.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
sure.
i
mean,
this
case,
your
honor,
you
have
to
overrule
10-12
cases
before
you
could
say
that
this
statute
would
not
be
applicable.
now,
the
only
thing
that
the
respondents
said,
the
only
argument
he
has
because
the
statute
has
an
effective
date
which
says
in
respect
of
july
1,
1972,
but
obviously
that
was
before
the
case
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit,
before
you
heard
the
case
in
this
court.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
legislative
history,
my
understanding
of
the
law,
your
honor,
is
if
the
legislative
history
is
neutral,
then
clearly
the
rule
of
thought
applies,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
legislative
history,
the
only
legislative
history
that
you
can
find
here
is
that,
at
one
time,
the
bill
specifically
provided
that
it
would
only
be
applicable
to
legal
services
performed
after
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
that
was
then
deleted
from
the
bill.
now,
to
the
extent
that
there’s
any
legislation,
that’s
it
and
also,
and
i
will
be
finished
with
this
report,
your
honor,
if
you
recall
in
goldstein
versus
california
which
was
decided
last
term,
mr.
chief
justice
when
you
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court,
you
spent
two
paragraphs
completely
twice
quoting
language
which
showed
congress
there
intended
specifically
only
to
apply
the
statute
in
the
future.
and,
it
was
clear
that
but
for
that
specific
language,
you
then
would
apply
that
statute
to
the
action
that
already
took
place.
and
not
only
under
718,
your
honor,
do
i
think
that
this
case
has
to
be
reversed
and
the
order
of
the
district
court
reinstated,
but
under
your
decision
in
hall
where
you
said
that,
there,
there
was
simply
a
congressional
statute
which
said
that
if
an
employee,
if
a
member
of
the
labor
union
was
kicked
out
of
the
union,
he
could
sue.
that
you
indicated
there
that
part
of
the
relief
since
what
he
did
was
an
ascertainable
class,
part
of
the
relief
could
be
the
reward
of
counsel
fee
and,
once
again,
the
district
court
awarded
the
counsel
fee
and
the
sole
issue
was
whether
you
should
upset
it.
the
issue
is
not
here
whether
if
they
had
not
awarded
the
counsel
fee,
what
would
be
the
result.
here,
you
have
a
case
where
the
court
did
exercise
the
power.
in
addition,
the
cases
make
it
clear
that
where
the
petitioner
acts
as
a
private
attorney
general,
he’s
entitled
to
counsel
fee
as
part
of
the
award.
and
the
one
thing
is
clear
and
it’s
contrary
that
private
persons
were
forced
to
bring
lawsuits
to
vindicate
constitutional
rights
which
resulted
in
the
desegregation
of
public
schools.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
piggie
park,
there’s
the
lee
case
in
the
fifth
circuit.
there
are
other
cases
which
say
that
where
it
happens
and
the
government,
here
in
its
amicus
brief,
freely
concedes
that
it
just
did
not
and
could
not
bring
the
litigation
which
resulted
in
the
desegregation
of
public
school
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
certainly
were
vindicating
the
rights
of
a
private
person.
now,
as
i
understand
the
respondent’s
brief,
he
pretty
much
concedes
that
if
you
read
mills,
if
you
read
hall,
if
you
read
the
private
attorney
general’s
cases
that
clearly
the
law
should
be,
that
under
those
circumstances
the
black
petitioners
were
entitled
to
counsel
fee.
but
he
says
that
because
congress
has
now
passed
section
718,
for
some
reason,
you
forget
the
one
group
of
people
that
stood
in
the
trenches,
that
took
the
risk
that
supplied
the
legal
talent
to
change
the
society
peacefully
and
by
the
use
of
law
rather
than
by
being
in
the
street
and
somehow,
they
should
be
penalized.
we
also
think
that
some
urge
in
the
government’s
position
that
the
best
thing
here
for
the
court,
for
all
courts,
is
to
award
the
fee
under
the
basis
of
the
hall
case
of
the
private
attorney
general
because
the
district
courts
and,
frankly,
we
don’t
like
to
be
in
litigation
with
school
boards
as
to
whether
they
were
obstinate
or
not.
now,
if
you
really
want
to
have
a
lot
of
litigation,
that’s
the
only
rule
you
would
go
for,
but
if
you’d
go
for
the
hall
rule
or
the
mills
rule
or
if
you
apply
section
718,
then
you
don’t
have
this
problem.
now,
on
the
being
obstinate,
i
think
the
findings
of
that
and
if
rule
52
needs
anything,
i
think
you
have
to
carryout
the
rule
of
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
after
all,
it
was
judge
marriage
who
dealt
day
and
day
with
the
litigants,
day
in
and
day
out.
he
was
the
one
that
knew
nuances
of
how
cooperative
you’ve
been,
the
things
which
you
just
can’t
put
in
the
record.
and,
he
was
the
one
that
made
the
determination
that
based
upon
everything
that
had
happened
before
him,
he
felt
the
award
should
be
made
on
that
basis.
he
also
was
the
one,
and
i
think
you
ought
to
give
some
weight
to
the
experiences
of
these
great
federal
district
judges
that
have
really
worked
this
problem
out
locally,
that
he
was
the
one
that
having
these
cases
and
knowing
cases,
talk
to
his
brother
who
i’m
pretty
sure,
realized
that
the
effort
involved
in
bringing
this
type
of
litigation
requires
there
to
be
competent
counsel.
counsel
has
to
be
skilled,
a
counsel
has
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
since
that
you
are
defending
the
public
here,
that
for
that
reason
you
ought
to
award
the
counsel
fee.
i
think
brown
number
two,
if
it
teaches
anything,
it
teaches
that
in
this
type
of
litigation
that
sometimes
the
rights
of
the
individual
have
to
be
subordinated
to
the
rights
of
the
entire
group.
and
that
clearly,
by
bringing
in
litigation
and
having
a
class
action,
you
are
functioning
to
change
the
whole
society.
and,
if
the
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
have
any
significance
at
all,
it
is
clear
that
in
this
instance
that
you
ought
to
indicate
that
there
is
--
that
we
were
functioning
as
a
private
or
mr.
greenberg
and
the
other
people
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
were
functioning
as
private
attorney
generals
and
on
that
basis,
you
should
reinstate
the
order
of
the
district
court.
thank
you.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
i’ve
read
a
lot
of
cases
of
this
court
and
i
stand
--
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
case
where
you’ve
used
this
obdurate
obstinacy
rule.
secondly,
the
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
obdurate
obstinacy
rule.
i
just
never
heard
it
in
any
of
your
opinions,
i’ve
never
read
it.
secondly,
what
really
happened
was,
in
several
cases
where
the
district
court
for
some
reason
denied
relief,
based
upon
the
findings
court
of
equity,
and
the
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
you
should
reverse
the
district
court
and
that’s
when
this
expression
appeared
in
a
couple
of
opinions.
thirdly,
there
have
been
very
few
cases
that
made
an
award
and,
in
the
bradley
case,
as
early,
the
award
was
$75.
now,
while
we
were
or
while
mr.
lucas
and
mrs.
chachkin
was
litigating
against
the
richmond
school
board,
it
so
happened
that
the
lawyer
for
the
richmond
school
board
for
the
same
period
of
time
received
fees
in
excess
of
$86,000.
this
is
public
money
from
a
school
system
with
60%
black,
40%
white.
clearly,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
blacks
were
violated.
it
is
only
fair
to
be
equitable
when
the
lawsuit
was
finally
successfully
won,
that
those
who
fought
the
school
board
ought
to
be
compensated.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
can
i
come
to
that
because
this
is
something
that
mr.
little,
who’s
a
very
skillful
advocate,
have
said
and
he
successfully
convinced
the
fourth
circuit
of
this.
judge
marriage
entered
the
order
of
april
5,
1971,
based
upon
the
state
of
law
in
his
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
which
had
decided
swan.
he
did
not
wait
for
your
opinion
and,
obviously,
he
couldn’t
determine
what
would
be
in
this
court
opinion
a
year
later
and
if
there’s
any
doubt
about
this,
i’d
like
to
call
your
attention
to
footnote
1
of
his
opinion.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
he
first
indicated
that
because,
since
by
1968
anyone
that
could
read
or
write
knew
that
the
richmond
school
board
was
violating
the
constitution
and
nobody
did
anything,
these
litigants
were
forced
to
come
into
court.
and,
in
part,
his
award
is
based
upon
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that’s
right.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
sure,
they
had
to
do
something.
and,
certainly,
what
you
did,
depending
upon
the
local
situation,
the
sincerity,
and
the
sophistication
of
the
school
board,
but,
what
he
says
is
if
you
take
the
law
as
it
existed
in
my
circuit
in
1970-1971,
the
school
board
did
not
discharge
its
functions.
and
his
opinion,
when
you
read
his
opinion
which
is
the
order
of
april
5,
1971,
you
will
find
where
he
states
“i’ve
been
told
to
hold
this
case
until
after
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
decides
swan,
but
i’m
not
going
to
do
that.
i’m
going
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
the
existing
law.”
so,
every
one
of
these
plans
he
threw
out,
he
threw
out
solely
because
it
did
not
comply
with
the
law
of
the
fourth
circuit.
he
did
not
throw
it
out
because
he
felt,
that
he
knew
that
a
year
later
you
were
going
to
decide
a
case
where
you
would
expand
the
rights
of
the
party.
now
in
closing,
your
honor,
on
this
question
of
the
applicability
of
section
718,
i
know
that
every
rule
about
appellate
arguments
says
one
thing
you
don’t
do
is
read
from
a
court
opinion.
but,
i
just
would
call
your
attention
to
the
thorpe
case
where
the
court
says
that
the
general
rule,
however,
is
that
an
appellate
court
must
apply
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
it
renders
its
decision.
then,
in
footnote
38,
a
change
in
the
law
between
a
--
apply,
and
appellate
decision
requires
the
appellate
court
to
apply
the
changed
law.
now,
that
is
the
law
and
as
i
understand
the
decision
of
this
court,
unless
the
respondents
can
point
to
a
legislative
history
or
specific
words
as
existed
in
goldstein
which
says
you
don’t
apply
to
pending
cases,
you
clearly
comply
to
the
pending
case.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
the
legislative
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
that’s
right.
unless
you
--
if
you
were
--
if
there’s
a
grave
injustice
and
if
you
talk
about
the
presumption
of
congress,
which
i
--
i’ve
never
used
congress,
but
i
always
felt
that
it’s
conceding
that
congressmen
reads
every
case
and
knows
every
statute,
anything
he
does,
he
knows
the
law.
and,
therefore,
that
you
think
that
those
congressmen
had
read
and
knew
the
obstinate
rule
which
existed
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuits.
when
we
read
those
cases,
i’m
pretty
sure
you’re
convinced
there
is
no
rule,
that’
the
theory
you’re
going
to
go
on,
which
i
really
think
is,
you
know,
it
just
isn’t
so.
congressmen
just
don’t
read
all
the
cases
and
they
don’t
have
time,
but
the
rule
which
is
certainly
one
that
any
legislature
ought
to
know
is
that
when
there’s
a
federal
statute
enacted,
that
that
statute
will
apply
to
existing
cases
unless
congress
goes
out
of
its
way
to
demonstrate
that
that
general
rule
is
not
to
be
applied.
now,
if
you
got
to
compete
between
which
presumption
you
should
take
of
congress,
i
think
that
that
has
to
be
the
presumption
because
that
is
the
law
in
the
federal
cases
and
it
seems
to
me,
on
that
basis,
you
should
apply
section718.
if
you
do
it,
you
avoid
a
lot
of
litigation.
it
becomes
very
simple
and
concise.
you
don’t
have
this
problem
and
i
can
understand
why
a
school
board
would
not
want
to
be
labeled
with
what
it
should
be
labeled
as,
namely,
that
the
fact
it
did
deny
the
right
to
these
black
children
and
it
took
a
lot
of
litigation
and
we
finally
converted
them.
but,
we
converted
them
three
or
four
years
later
and
while
we
were
in
there
and
trying
to
convert
them,
i
think
that
we’re
entitled
to
counsel
fees.
