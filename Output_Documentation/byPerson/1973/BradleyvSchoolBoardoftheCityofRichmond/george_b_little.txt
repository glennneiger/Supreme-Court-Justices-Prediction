mr.
george
b.
little
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
could
be
narrowed
very
quickly.
we
take
no
issue
with
the
fundamental
sounds
of
the
rationale
advanced
by
this
court
in
mills,
in
newman
versus
piggie
park,
in
hall
v.
cole,
and
cognate
cases,
but
we
must
question
the
applicability
of
the
rationale
of
those
cases
to
pre-swan
school
desegregation
litigation.
accordingly,
we
take
the
position
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
affirmed
since
the
unique
nature
of
pre-swan
school
desegregation
litigation
renders
the
traditional
equitable
standard
of
overt
obstinacy
entirely
appropriate
for
litigation
in
that
area.
that,
the
record
fully
exonerates
the
district
court’s
findings
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
this
board
and
for
the
reason
that
section
718
does
not
reach
services
concluded
more
in
17
months
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
by
way
of
an
overview
to
reach
our
position,
we
must
go
back
to
1970,
that
is
the
area
of
time
involved.
we
can
gain
a
proper
perspective
to
determine
what
is
a
proper
standard
to
measure
the
conduct
of
the
board,
with
respect
to
pre-swan
litigation,
through
a
very
brief
review
of
the
actual,
factual
realities
confronting
the
richmond
school
board,
the
precise
issue
that
gave
rise
to
all
of
this
litigation
and
a
very
brief
review
of
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
then
applied,
particularly
to
the
issue
involved.
the
dilemma
confronting
the
richmond
school
board
at
the
time
of
the
filing
for
motion
for
further
relief
on
march
10,
1970
prior
to
swan
is
very
easy
to
describe
to
the
court.
we
had
a
large
metropolitan
system,
majority
black,
characterized
99%
by
marked
residentially
segregated
neighborhoods.
the
first
plan
submitted
by
the
school
board
based
entirely
on
the
efforts
of
hew,
they
prepared
the
plan,
the
first
plan
which
was
rejected.
the
principal
deficiency
in
that
plan
was
the
failure
of
hew,
and
i’m
not
saying
it’s
their
responsibility,
it’s
the
school
board’s
responsibility,
but
in
drawing
the
plan,
they
refused
to
use
transportation
over
and
above
what
was
then
being
done
in
richmond.
every
bit
of
the
litigation
from
that
point
on
narrowed
down
to
even
a
much
more
restricted
aspect
of
the
transportation
issue.
now,
this
is
in
the
summer
of
1970.
specifically,
the
issue
narrowed
down
as
fine
as
this.
the
necessity
for
buying
buses
to
alter
the
racial
composition
of
19
elementary
schools
because
the
interim
plan,
that
was
approved
by
judge
marriage,
which
was
the
second
plan
submitted,
did
the
job
at
the
high
school
level,
at
the
middle
school
level,
and
at
the
elementary
level
with
the
exception
of
these
19
schools.
twelve,
more
than
90%
black
on
one
side
of
town
and
seven,
more
than
90%
white
on
the
other
side
of
town.
the
racial
composition
of
these
19
schools
was
the
major
deficiency
which
the
court
found
in
the
interim
plan
which
was
implemented
in
september
1970.
it
formed
the
basis
for
the
plaintiffs’
motion
for
mid-year
implementation
of
additional
relief
beginning
in
january
of
1971
which
the
lower
court
denied
and
it
was
the
reason
why
judge
marriage
ordered
further
relief
on
april
5,
1971.
now,
on
this
issue,
there
was
no
disagreement
that
the
only
way
these
19
schools
could
be
desegregated
was
by
the
extensive
cross
down
transportation
of
elementary-aged
children.
it
was
also
agreed,
richmond
had
never
operated
a
transportation
system
with
the
exception
of,
i
think,
eight
buses
used
in
special
education.
and,
that
public
transportation
was
not
then
available,
the
capacity
to
do
the
job,
they
were
not
disputed
issues.
now,
so
much
for
the
factual
dilemma;
let’s
come
to
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
existed
on
this
issue.
in
the
same
month
that
the
motion
for
further
relief
was
filed,
the
chief
justice
in
northcross
pointed
out
that
whereas
the
objective
of
a
unitary
system
non
--
wherein
racial
discrimination
did
not
exist,
it
was
perfectly
clear,
the
means
were
left
largely
unresolved.
specifically,
the
chief
justice
mentioned
one
of
the
issues
as
being
the
extent
to
which
transportation
may
or
must
be
used,
as
a
desegregation
tool.
in
swan,
this
court
frankly
acknowledged
the
enormity
of
the
problem,
the
complexities
of
the
problem
as
it
did
beginning
with
brown
one
as
it
repeated
in
brown
two
because
bear
in
mind,
school
desegregation
litigation
set
a
precedent
in
our
history
of
jurisprudence.
it
was
the
first
time
of
which
i
am
aware
of
that
constitutionally
deferred
--
constitutionally
declared
rights
had
to
be
deferred
because
of
the
complexities
of
the
problem.
thus,
it
was
not
until
may,
i
beg
your
pardon,
april
20,
1971
that
there
was
any
occasion
for
this
court
to
ever
have
addressed
itself
to
the
metropolitan
school
problem.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
swan
decision,
it
was
its
first
effort
to
deal
with
this
subject
of
transportation.
now,
what
was
the
law
in
the
fourth
circuit?
bear
in
mind,
we
lived
in
virginia
under
the
law
of
briggs
versus
elliott
for
fourteen
years
prior
to
this
decision
in
greene
when
no
less
a
juris
than
john
j.
parker
interpreted
brown
to
mean
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
constitution
to
require
integration.
so,
the
light
is
not
the
dawn
too
early
in
virginia.
the
first
time
that
the
fourth
circuit
had
occasion
to
address
either
transportation
or
metropolitan
school
district
where
in
its
decisions
in
swan
and
brewer.
now
these
decisions
were
both
decided
after
the
hew
plan
had
been
rejected.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
of
the
preparation
of
the
first
plan
that
was
submitted
by
hew
there
were
no
guidelines
from
this
court
or
from
the
fourth
circuit
with
respect
to
metropolitan
school
districts.
now,
significantly,
the
district
court
found
that
the
interim
plan,
which
we
submitted
within
19
days
after
the
decision
in
brewer,
fully
complied
with
the
fourth
circuit’s
test
of
reasonableness
as
it
then
existed
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
that
it
represented,
this
is
the
judge’s
language,
a
sincere
effort
to
comply
with
the
guidelines.
he
was
not
thinking
in
terms
of
bad
faith
at
that
time,
that
reference
is
317
f.
supp.
at
pages
573
and
575.
now,
the
precise
issue
that
we
were
wrestling
with,
and
the
state
of
law
with
respect
to
that
issue,
provides
a
setting
for
our
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
err
in
applying
the
conditional
equitable
standard
with
respect
to
fees
or
in
concluding
that
the
board
--
that
the
record
exonerated
the
board
under
this
status.
the
universal
acknowledgment
by
every
court
in
this
country
of
the
enormity
and
the
complexity
of
this
type
of
litigation
prior
to
swan
underlies
the
decision
and
the
determination
by
every
court
of
appeals
in
this
country
which
has
passed
on
the
issue
that
the
appropriate
pre-swan
standard
is
the
traditional
equitable
standard
of
obstinacy
in
every
suit
that
has
been
brought
under
section
1983.
i
don’t
think
we
should
presume
that
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
the
sixth,
the
eighth,
and
the
ninth
circuits
have
been
oblivious
to
either
the
vital
importance
of
the
constitutional
rights
being
vindicated
to
the
public
benefit
that
has
resulted
or
to
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs,
in
a
very
real
sense,
are
acting
as
attorney
generals.
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
in
five
circuits,
sir
--
mr.
george
b.
little
there
had
been
any
number
of
decisions
allowing
them
sir,
but
always
on
the
standard
of
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
conditional
--
mr.
george

little
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.

without
exception
--
with
the
exception
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
no
court
in
this
country
at
the
circuit
court
level
or
at
the
district
court
level
has
ever
made
an
award
against
the
school
board
other
than
on
the
obdurate
obstinacy
test,
that
is
for
services
rendered
pre-swan.
mr.

yes,

i
mean,
i’m
addressing
myself
prior
to
that.
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir,
but
only
solely
on
that
basis
--
mr.
george
b.
little
without
exception,
which
is
a
unique
thing
to
be
able
to
say
with
that
many
courts
involved
in
that
amount
of
litigation.
mr.
george
b.
little
five,
sir,
the
fourth,
fifth,
sixth,
eighth,
and
ninth.
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
sir.
we
--
the
standard
of
the
statute
has
been
set
by
this
court
and
we
have
no
--
in
northcross
in
june
of
this
past
year,
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
but,
that
addresses
itself
when
we
will
come
to
section
718,
but
i’m
bringing
out
what
the
absolute
uniformity
has
been
prior
to
that.
now
these
same
factors,
that
is,
the
enormity
of
the
problem,
the
complexities
involved,
the
frequent
admonition
by
this
court
beginning
with
brown
two
that
equitable
standard
shall
govern,
and
the
courts
construed
that
to
mean
the
traditional
equitable
standard
with
respect
to
the
award
of
fees,
has
been
the
basis
for
distinguishing
this
type
of
litigation
from
every
other
form
of
civil
rights
litigation
of
which
i
am
aware.
the
recognition
of
this
distinctive
nature
of
pre-swan
litigation
has
lead
the
fifth
circuit,
subsequent
to
the
decisions
of
hall
v.
cole
and
northcross
by
this
court,
to
expressly
reject
the
reasoning
of
a
district
court
in
this
case
and
to
reaffirm
the
traditional
equitable
standard
of
obdurate
obstinacy
even
though,
and
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
this
particularly,
the
fifth
circuit
had
previously
extended
the
newman
rationale
to
other
civil
rights
actions
brought
under
sections
1981
and
1982,
but
it
said
not
so
in
light
of
the
uncertainties
of
the
law
that
existed.
the
rationale,
why
the
fifth
circuit
refused
to
do
this,
is
well-stated
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief,
it’s
a
part
of
a
quotation
from
johnson
versus
combs.
this
complete
uncertainty
of
the
law
which
has
lead
to
this
uniform
adoption
by
all
of
the
circuits
underlies
the
basic
fallacy
in
the
district
court’s
finding
as
to
the
conduct
of
this
board
in
this
case.
the
basic
premise
that
judge
marriage
used
to
substantiate
his
conduct
finding
was
that
the
richmond
school
board
had
ignored
clear
legal
directives.
such
a
finding,
in
light
of
what
we
had
just
reviewed
as
to
the
unsettled
state
of
the
law
at
that
time,
compelled
a
reversal
by
the
fourth
circuit
on
that
ground.
as
the
district
court,
throughout
this
litigation,
itself
had
made
repeated
references
to
the
unsettled
state
of
the
law
at
that
time.
let
me
cite
just
one;
eight
weeks
before
the
opinion
came
down
finding
bad
conduct
and
clear
authority
--
i
mean,
the
ignoring
the
clear
legal
authorities,
this
is
what
the
district
court
itself
was
cautioning
us
about.
this
was
on
march
4,
1971
prior
to
swan.
we
were
all
groping,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
did
not
know
what
this
court
would
ultimately
do
in
swan.
the
district
court
said
we
ought
to
contemplate
that
there
may
be
some
expression
in
the
law
which
would
advocate
neighborhood
schools
for
children
in
grades
one
through
five.
this
was
eight
weeks
before
his
opinion
of
may
26.
moreover,
the
district
court
--
i
mean,
the
court
of
appeals
could
hardly
have
concurred
in
what
the
judge
below
had
singled
out
as
the
real
failure
of
the
richmond
school
board,
namely,
its
failure
to
buy
buses
until
ordered
to
so.
if
you
will
look
on
pages
133,
134,
and
135
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
on
pages
118
of
the
record
the
judge
says
“the
school
board
had
in
august
still
taken
no
step
to
acquire
the
necessary
equipment,”
he’s
addressing
himself
to
august
of
1970.
this
is
a
quote
from
his
may
26,
1971
opinion
and
yet
what
did
the
judge
himself
say
on
august
7,
1970,
the
same
month,
in
open
court?
“it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
completely
unreasonable
--“
mr.
george
b.
little
i’m
reading,
sir,
from
our
brief
of
what
is
in
appendix
85a,
85a
of
the
appendix,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
now,
this
is
what
the
judge
thought
below
was
about
buying
buses
in
august
of
1970.
“it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
completely
unreasonable
to
force
a
school
system
that
has
no
transportation
and
you
don’t
have
any
to
any
great
extent
to
go
out
and
buy
new
buses
when
the
united
states
supreme
court
may
say
it
is
wrong.”
now,
the
district
court
on
three
occasions,
in
june
of
1970,
in
august
of
1970,
in
january
of
1971,
had
refused
to
order
us
to
buy
buses,
despite
the
request
to
do
so
because
he
knew
at
that
time
that
the
law
was
unsettled.
i
think,
in
view
of
time,
i
better
move
to
the
significant
reasons
why
we
say
that
section
718
should
not
be
applied
to
pre-swan
services.
first,
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuits
are
the
only
two
that
have
had
occasion
to
rule
on
the
applicability
of
section
718
to
pre-swan
services.
both
have
refused
or
declined
to
do
so,
to
apply
section
718
to
those
services.
one
of
the
grounds
cited
by
both
of
the
courts
that
the
--
was
that
the
inconclusive
legislative
history
of
section
718,
and
both
courts
determined
that
the
legislative
history
was
inconclusive,
did
not
overcome
the
historic
presumption
against
the
prospective
operation
of
statutes
absent,
clear,
and
unambiguous
intent
to
the
contrary.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
we
feel
that
that
rule
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
teachings
of
united
states
versus
schooner
peggy
and
with
thorpe.
as
judge
winters
conceded
in
his
dissent
in
this
case,
and
you’ll
see
on
page
192,
he
doesn’t
like
this
interpretation
of
peggy
schooner,
but
he
does
concede
that
the
facts
in
schooner
peggy
and
much
of
the
opinion
deals
with
the
effect
on
a
change
in
law
pending
appeal,
is
that
the
proper
statement
of
the
rule
is
that
when
there
is
a
change
in
law,
of
course,
the
appellate
court
is
required
to
consider
that
law,
that
is
not
saying
“applying
it.”
it
is
to
examine
that
law
to
try
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
intended
to
cover
transactions
which
had
transpired
prior
to
its
enactment.
this
was
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
both
us
versus,
chief
justice
marshall
did,
in
us
versus
schooner
peggy
and,
i
submit,
what
was
done
in
thorpe.
now,
let’s
mention
thorpe
just
a
moment.
no
one
can
deny
the
existence
of
the
historic
presumption
of
retroactivity
--
i
mean,
against
retroactivity
of
a
congressional
enactment.
we
can’t
agree
with
judge
winters
who
says
that
thorpe
reverses
that
presumption.
in
his
view,
once
a
law
is
changed
you
presume
it
applies
to
a
pending
case
unless
there
is
intent
to
the
contrary.
when
you
look
at
thorpe,
there
are
two
things
i
would
invite
the
court’s
attention
to.
the
court
there
went
and
construed
the
regulation
involved,
the
hud
regulation
involved
and
after
construing
it
as
applying
to
all
tenants
still
residing
in
the
project,
this
is
an
ejectment
suit,
eviction
under
housing
act,
it
then
decided
that
it
applied
to
this
lady
whose
litigation
was
then
in
process.
in
addition,
thorpe
is
one
of
those
cases
that
we
members
of
the
bar
have
a
hard
time
determining
the
proper
scope
of
for
the
reason
that,
in
thorpe,
this
court
judiciously
avoided
a
fundamental
question
of
due
process
by
a
very
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
regulation
before
it.
so
much
for
the
first
reason
for
not
applying
section
718,
another
one
is
well
stated
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
johnson
versus
combs
and
i
will
read
just
a
portion
of
the
quotation.
it’s
found
on
--
“to
apply
this
statute
retroactively
would
place
a
wholly
unexpected
and
unwarranted
burden
on
these
districts
who
have
done
no
more
than
litigate
what
they
in
good
faith
believe
to
be
demands
which
exceeded
the
constitution’s
demands.”
this
rationale
is
expanded,
but
time
does
not
permit
me
to
read
any
more
from
it,
but
that
is
the
second
ground
that
has
been
use
as
the
basis
for
not
applying
section
718
to
pre-swan
services.
and,
as
i’ve
mentioned
earlier,
the
fifth
circuit
reaffirmed
the
same
standard
for
pre-swan
services
even
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
northcross
and
in
hall
v.
cole,
they
did
that
in
henry
versus
clarksdale.
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
sir.
i
think
when
you’re
in
the
area
of
procedure,
i
think
any
change
on
procedure
other
than
a
juris
--
if
you
--
i’m
using
the
term
very
restrictively
as
procedure,
as
long
as
it
doesn’t
affect
jurisdiction
of
court,
as
procedure
i
think
there
would
be
less
hesitancy
to
apply
it
to
every
pending
case.
mr.
george
b.
little
sir,
i
think
that
the
way
the
analogy
has
to
be
the
section
718,
what
is
it
in
that
that
gives
rise
to
an
attorney’s
fees?
and,
this
brings
me
right
to
this
point
of
another
basis
for
not
applying
and
that
is
the
entry
of
an
order
of
compliance,
in
other
words,
an
order
necessary
for
compliance.
and,
the
fourth
circuit
of
course
said
while
there
was
no
order
of
compliance
on
appeal
or
that
was
even
pending
at
the
time
of
the
effective
date
of
section
718,
and
that
is
another
basis.
but
i
think
the
true
test,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
how
do
we
say
that
congress,
knowing
that
this
rule
of
obdurate
obstinacy,
has
prevailed
uniformly
throughout
the
country
in
five
circuits
and,
how
many
district
courts,
i
don’t
know,
that
they
would
come
in
and
enact
the
statute
intending
to
cover
services
rendered
prior
to
its
effective
date.
i
have
very
great
difficulty
in
thinking
that
congress
intended
to
bring
about
a
lot
of
re-litigation
because
bear
in
mind,
school
desegregation
suits
are
unique
in
another
sense.
adhering
to
the
admonishments
of
this
court,
these
cases
are
still
within
the
realm
of
pending
cases.
there
are
a
great
many
school
desegregation
cases,
of
course,
still
pending
on
the
dockets.
this
court’s
decision
in
this
case
will
certainly
have
a
bearing
on
whether
or
not
this
whole
question
of
attorney’s
fees
can
be
reopened
om
a
great
many
other
desegregation
cases.
mr.
george
b.
little
no
order
--
the
fourth
circuit
draws
a
distinction,
mr.
justice
white,
between
there
was
no
order
compliance
pending
at
the
date
this
act
became
effective
because
the
last
order
--
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
if
the
--
no,
i’m
not
saying
that,
sir.
no,
i’m
not
--
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
they
had
requested
that
right
at
the
outset.
mr.
george
b.
little
pending
on
the
issue
of
attorney’s
fees,
it
was,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
right,
sir.
then
you
have
to
go
to
the
congressional
intent
--
mr.
george
b.
little
that
i
say
you
have
to,
under
the
rule
of
peggy
schooner
and
thorpe
that
you
start
with
a
presumption
against
retroactivity.
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
sir.
i
rely
on
us
versus
laramie
stock
yards
and
greene
for
the
rule,
but
i’m
trying
to
relate
united
states
versus
schooner
peggy
and
thorpe
to
the
normal
rule
of
prospective
application
absent
clear
and
unambiguous
intent
to
the
contrary.
mr.
george
b.
little
what
--
may
i
have
that
again,
sir,
i’m
sorry?
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
sir,
but
i
find
this.
i
don’t
--
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that,
in
thorpe,
this
case
intended
to
modify
the
normal
rule
of
prospective
application
without
even
referring
to
the
rule.
i
have
great
difficulty
there.
i
would
like
to
summarize,
if
i
may.
our
disagreement
with
the
petitioners
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it
is
not
any
basic
difference
of
philosophy
regarding
the
propriety
of
fee
shifting
in
civil
rights
cases.
indeed,
we
feel
that
the
trend
in
congress
and
in
the
courts
to
expand
the
concept
of
fee
shifting
in
these
cases
is
probably
long
overdue.
and,
normally,
the
standards
embodied
in
section
718
as
construed
by
this
court
in
northcross
and
under
other
sections
of
the
civil
rights
act
are
fully
appropriate,
but
this
is
where
we
have
trouble.
we
have
trouble
and
we
must
question
whether
conscientious
school
boards
laboring
in
the
struggling
in
the
sea
of
pre-swan
uncertainty,
and
that’s
what
it
was,
may
it
please
the
court,
regardless
of
how
conscientious
the
school
board
was,
should
be
held
to
be
in
the
same
legal
shoes
as
those
who
callously
deny
explicit
rights
in
such
areas
as
public
accommodation
and
housing
and
employment.
the
expansion
and
extension
of
the
doctrine
of
mills
and
newman
and
hall
v.
cole,
we
think,
is
fully
appropriate
to
many
forms
of
the
civil
rights
actions
which
are
being
brought
under
section
1983.
but
we
say
that
they
--
such
an
expansion
is
not
warranted
in
pre-swan
school
desegregation
litigation
because
of
the
complexities
which
necessitated
the
evolutionary
development
of
remedies
in
school
desegregation.
we
say
that
this
record
exonerates
the
school
board
under
the
obdurate
obstinacy
standard
and
certainly,
would
render
the
imposition
of
a
stigma
of
bad
faith
unjustified.
admittedly,
upholding
the
award
under
section
718
or
under
any
other
theory
while
more
palatable
would
be
incorrect
for
the
reasons
cited
and
would
also
create
quite
an
inequity
of
subjecting
these
respondents,
this
school
board
as
being
the
only
school
board
in
this
country
that
is
ever
been
held
to
that
standard
for
pre-swan
litigation.
mr.
george
b.
little
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
could
be
narrowed
very
quickly.
we
take
no
issue
with
the
fundamental
sounds
of
the
rationale
advanced
by
this
court
in
mills,
in
newman
versus
piggie
park,
in
hall
v.
cole,
and
cognate
cases,
but
we
must
question
the
applicability
of
the
rationale
of
those
cases
to
pre-swan
school
desegregation
litigation.
accordingly,
we
take
the
position
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
affirmed
since
the
unique
nature
of
pre-swan
school
desegregation
litigation
renders
the
traditional
equitable
standard
of
overt
obstinacy
entirely
appropriate
for
litigation
in
that
area.
that,
the
record
fully
exonerates
the
district
court’s
findings
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
this
board
and
for
the
reason
that
section
718
does
not
reach
services
concluded
more
in
17
months
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
by
way
of
an
overview
to
reach
our
position,
we
must
go
back
to
1970,
that
is
the
area
of
time
involved.
we
can
gain
a
proper
perspective
to
determine
what
is
a
proper
standard
to
measure
the
conduct
of
the
board,
with
respect
to
pre-swan
litigation,
through
a
very
brief
review
of
the
actual,
factual
realities
confronting
the
richmond
school
board,
the
precise
issue
that
gave
rise
to
all
of
this
litigation
and
a
very
brief
review
of
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
then
applied,
particularly
to
the
issue
involved.
the
dilemma
confronting
the
richmond
school
board
at
the
time
of
the
filing
for
motion
for
further
relief
on
march
10,
1970
prior
to
swan
is
very
easy
to
describe
to
the
court.
we
had
a
large
metropolitan
system,
majority
black,
characterized
99%
by
marked
residentially
segregated
neighborhoods.
the
first
plan
submitted
by
the
school
board
based
entirely
on
the
efforts
of
hew,
they
prepared
the
plan,
the
first
plan
which
was
rejected.
the
principal
deficiency
in
that
plan
was
the
failure
of
hew,
and
i’m
not
saying
it’s
their
responsibility,
it’s
the
school
board’s
responsibility,
but
in
drawing
the
plan,
they
refused
to
use
transportation
over
and
above
what
was
then
being
done
in
richmond.
every
bit
of
the
litigation
from
that
point
on
narrowed
down
to
even
a
much
more
restricted
aspect
of
the
transportation
issue.
now,
this
is
in
the
summer
of
1970.
specifically,
the
issue
narrowed
down
as
fine
as
this.
the
necessity
for
buying
buses
to
alter
the
racial
composition
of
19
elementary
schools
because
the
interim
plan,
that
was
approved
by
judge
marriage,
which
was
the
second
plan
submitted,
did
the
job
at
the
high
school
level,
at
the
middle
school
level,
and
at
the
elementary
level
with
the
exception
of
these
19
schools.
twelve,
more
than
90%
black
on
one
side
of
town
and
seven,
more
than
90%
white
on
the
other
side
of
town.
the
racial
composition
of
these
19
schools
was
the
major
deficiency
which
the
court
found
in
the
interim
plan
which
was
implemented
in
september
1970.
it
formed
the
basis
for
the
plaintiffs’
motion
for
mid-year
implementation
of
additional
relief
beginning
in
january
of
1971
which
the
lower
court
denied
and
it
was
the
reason
why
judge
marriage
ordered
further
relief
on
april
5,
1971.
now,
on
this
issue,
there
was
no
disagreement
that
the
only
way
these
19
schools
could
be
desegregated
was
by
the
extensive
cross
down
transportation
of
elementary-aged
children.
it
was
also
agreed,
richmond
had
never
operated
a
transportation
system
with
the
exception
of,
i
think,
eight
buses
used
in
special
education.
and,
that
public
transportation
was
not
then
available,
the
capacity
to
do
the
job,
they
were
not
disputed
issues.
now,
so
much
for
the
factual
dilemma;
let’s
come
to
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
existed
on
this
issue.
in
the
same
month
that
the
motion
for
further
relief
was
filed,
the
chief
justice
in
northcross
pointed
out
that
whereas
the
objective
of
a
unitary
system
non
--
wherein
racial
discrimination
did
not
exist,
it
was
perfectly
clear,
the
means
were
left
largely
unresolved.
specifically,
the
chief
justice
mentioned
one
of
the
issues
as
being
the
extent
to
which
transportation
may
or
must
be
used,
as
a
desegregation
tool.
in
swan,
this
court
frankly
acknowledged
the
enormity
of
the
problem,
the
complexities
of
the
problem
as
it
did
beginning
with
brown
one
as
it
repeated
in
brown
two
because
bear
in
mind,
school
desegregation
litigation
set
a
precedent
in
our
history
of
jurisprudence.
it
was
the
first
time
of
which
i
am
aware
of
that
constitutionally
deferred
--
constitutionally
declared
rights
had
to
be
deferred
because
of
the
complexities
of
the
problem.
thus,
it
was
not
until
may,
i
beg
your
pardon,
april
20,
1971
that
there
was
any
occasion
for
this
court
to
ever
have
addressed
itself
to
the
metropolitan
school
problem.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
swan
decision,
it
was
its
first
effort
to
deal
with
this
subject
of
transportation.
now,
what
was
the
law
in
the
fourth
circuit?
bear
in
mind,
we
lived
in
virginia
under
the
law
of
briggs
versus
elliott
for
fourteen
years
prior
to
this
decision
in
greene
when
no
less
a
juris
than
john
j.
parker
interpreted
brown
to
mean
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
constitution
to
require
integration.
so,
the
light
is
not
the
dawn
too
early
in
virginia.
the
first
time
that
the
fourth
circuit
had
occasion
to
address
either
transportation
or
metropolitan
school
district
where
in
its
decisions
in
swan
and
brewer.
now
these
decisions
were
both
decided
after
the
hew
plan
had
been
rejected.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
of
the
preparation
of
the
first
plan
that
was
submitted
by
hew
there
were
no
guidelines
from
this
court
or
from
the
fourth
circuit
with
respect
to
metropolitan
school
districts.
now,
significantly,
the
district
court
found
that
the
interim
plan,
which
we
submitted
within
19
days
after
the
decision
in
brewer,
fully
complied
with
the
fourth
circuit’s
test
of
reasonableness
as
it
then
existed
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
that
it
represented,
this
is
the
judge’s
language,
a
sincere
effort
to
comply
with
the
guidelines.
he
was
not
thinking
in
terms
of
bad
faith
at
that
time,
that
reference
is
317
f.
supp.
at
pages
573
and
575.
now,
the
precise
issue
that
we
were
wrestling
with,
and
the
state
of
law
with
respect
to
that
issue,
provides
a
setting
for
our
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
err
in
applying
the
conditional
equitable
standard
with
respect
to
fees
or
in
concluding
that
the
board
--
that
the
record
exonerated
the
board
under
this
status.
the
universal
acknowledgment
by
every
court
in
this
country
of
the
enormity
and
the
complexity
of
this
type
of
litigation
prior
to
swan
underlies
the
decision
and
the
determination
by
every
court
of
appeals
in
this
country
which
has
passed
on
the
issue
that
the
appropriate
pre-swan
standard
is
the
traditional
equitable
standard
of
obstinacy
in
every
suit
that
has
been
brought
under
section
1983.
i
don’t
think
we
should
presume
that
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
the
sixth,
the
eighth,
and
the
ninth
circuits
have
been
oblivious
to
either
the
vital
importance
of
the
constitutional
rights
being
vindicated
to
the
public
benefit
that
has
resulted
or
to
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs,
in
a
very
real
sense,
are
acting
as
attorney
generals.
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
in
five
circuits,
sir
--
mr.
george
b.
little
there
had
been
any
number
of
decisions
allowing
them
sir,
but
always
on
the
standard
of
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
conditional
--
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
without
exception
--
with
the
exception
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
no
court
in
this
country
at
the
circuit
court
level
or
at
the
district
court
level
has
ever
made
an
award
against
the
school
board
other
than
on
the
obdurate
obstinacy
test,
that
is
for
services
rendered
pre-swan.
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir.
i
mean,
i’m
addressing
myself
prior
to
that.
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir,
but
only
solely
on
that
basis
--
mr.
george
b.
little
without
exception,
which
is
a
unique
thing
to
be
able
to
say
with
that
many
courts
involved
in
that
amount
of
litigation.
mr.
george
b.
little
five,
sir,
the
fourth,
fifth,
sixth,
eighth,
and
ninth.
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
sir.
we
--
the
standard
of
the
statute
has
been
set
by
this
court
and
we
have
no
--
in
northcross
in
june
of
this
past
year,
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
but,
that
addresses
itself
when
we
will
come
to
section
718,
but
i’m
bringing
out
what
the
absolute
uniformity
has
been
prior
to
that.
now
these
same
factors,
that
is,
the
enormity
of
the
problem,
the
complexities
involved,
the
frequent
admonition
by
this
court
beginning
with
brown
two
that
equitable
standard
shall
govern,
and
the
courts
construed
that
to
mean
the
traditional
equitable
standard
with
respect
to
the
award
of
fees,
has
been
the
basis
for
distinguishing
this
type
of
litigation
from
every
other
form
of
civil
rights
litigation
of
which
i
am
aware.
the
recognition
of
this
distinctive
nature
of
pre-swan
litigation
has
lead
the
fifth
circuit,
subsequent
to
the
decisions
of
hall
v.
cole
and
northcross
by
this
court,
to
expressly
reject
the
reasoning
of
a
district
court
in
this
case
and
to
reaffirm
the
traditional
equitable
standard
of
obdurate
obstinacy
even
though,
and
i
call
the
court’s
attention
to
this
particularly,
the
fifth
circuit
had
previously
extended
the
newman
rationale
to
other
civil
rights
actions
brought
under
sections
1981
and
1982,
but
it
said
not
so
in
light
of
the
uncertainties
of
the
law
that
existed.
the
rationale,
why
the
fifth
circuit
refused
to
do
this,
is
well-stated
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief,
it’s
a
part
of
a
quotation
from
johnson
versus
combs.
this
complete
uncertainty
of
the
law
which
has
lead
to
this
uniform
adoption
by
all
of
the
circuits
underlies
the
basic
fallacy
in
the
district
court’s
finding
as
to
the
conduct
of
this
board
in
this
case.
the
basic
premise
that
judge
marriage
used
to
substantiate
his
conduct
finding
was
that
the
richmond
school
board
had
ignored
clear
legal
directives.
such
a
finding,
in
light
of
what
we
had
just
reviewed
as
to
the
unsettled
state
of
the
law
at
that
time,
compelled
a
reversal
by
the
fourth
circuit
on
that
ground.
as
the
district
court,
throughout
this
litigation,
itself
had
made
repeated
references
to
the
unsettled
state
of
the
law
at
that
time.
let
me
cite
just
one;
eight
weeks
before
the
opinion
came
down
finding
bad
conduct
and
clear
authority
--
i
mean,
the
ignoring
the
clear
legal
authorities,
this
is
what
the
district
court
itself
was
cautioning
us
about.
this
was
on
march
4,
1971
prior
to
swan.
we
were
all
groping,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
did
not
know
what
this
court
would
ultimately
do
in
swan.
the
district
court
said
we
ought
to
contemplate
that
there
may
be
some
expression
in
the
law
which
would
advocate
neighborhood
schools
for
children
in
grades
one
through
five.
this
was
eight
weeks
before
his
opinion
of
may
26.
moreover,
the
district
court
--
i
mean,
the
court
of
appeals
could
hardly
have
concurred
in
what
the
judge
below
had
singled
out
as
the
real
failure
of
the
richmond
school
board,
namely,
its
failure
to
buy
buses
until
ordered
to
so.
if
you
will
look
on
pages
133,
134,
and
135
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
on
pages
118
of
the
record
the
judge
says
“the
school
board
had
in
august
still
taken
no
step
to
acquire
the
necessary
equipment,”
he’s
addressing
himself
to
august
of
1970.
this
is
a
quote
from
his
may
26,
1971
opinion
and
yet
what
did
the
judge
himself
say
on
august
7,
1970,
the
same
month,
in
open
court?
“it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
completely
unreasonable
--“
mr.
george
b.
little
i’m
reading,
sir,
from
our
brief
of
what
is
in
appendix
85a,
85a
of
the
appendix,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
now,
this
is
what
the
judge
thought
below
was
about
buying
buses
in
august
of
1970.
“it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
completely
unreasonable
to
force
a
school
system
that
has
no
transportation
and
you
don’t
have
any
to
any
great
extent
to
go
out
and
buy
new
buses
when
the
united
states
supreme
court
may
say
it
is
wrong.”
now,
the
district
court
on
three
occasions,
in
june
of
1970,
in
august
of
1970,
in
january
of
1971,
had
refused
to
order
us
to
buy
buses,
despite
the
request
to
do
so
because
he
knew
at
that
time
that
the
law
was
unsettled.
i
think,
in
view
of
time,
i
better
move
to
the
significant
reasons
why
we
say
that
section
718
should
not
be
applied
to
pre-swan
services.
first,
the
fourth
and
fifth
circuits
are
the
only
two
that
have
had
occasion
to
rule
on
the
applicability
of
section
718
to
pre-swan
services.
both
have
refused
or
declined
to
do
so,
to
apply
section
718
to
those
services.
one
of
the
grounds
cited
by
both
of
the
courts
that
the
--
was
that
the
inconclusive
legislative
history
of
section
718,
and
both
courts
determined
that
the
legislative
history
was
inconclusive,
did
not
overcome
the
historic
presumption
against
the
prospective
operation
of
statutes
absent,
clear,
and
unambiguous
intent
to
the
contrary.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
we
feel
that
that
rule
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
teachings
of
united
states
versus
schooner
peggy
and
with
thorpe.
as
judge
winters
conceded
in
his
dissent
in
this
case,
and
you’ll
see
on
page
192,
he
doesn’t
like
this
interpretation
of
peggy
schooner,
but
he
does
concede
that
the
facts
in
schooner
peggy
and
much
of
the
opinion
deals
with
the
effect
on
a
change
in
law
pending
appeal,
is
that
the
proper
statement
of
the
rule
is
that
when
there
is
a
change
in
law,
of
course,
the
appellate
court
is
required
to
consider
that
law,
that
is
not
saying
“applying
it.”
it
is
to
examine
that
law
to
try
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
intended
to
cover
transactions
which
had
transpired
prior
to
its
enactment.
this
was
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
both
us
versus,
chief
justice
marshall
did,
in
us
versus
schooner
peggy
and,
i
submit,
what
was
done
in
thorpe.
now,
let’s
mention
thorpe
just
a
moment.
no
one
can
deny
the
existence
of
the
historic
presumption
of
retroactivity
--
i
mean,
against
retroactivity
of
a
congressional
enactment.
we
can’t
agree
with
judge
winters
who
says
that
thorpe
reverses
that
presumption.
in
his
view,
once
a
law
is
changed
you
presume
it
applies
to
a
pending
case
unless
there
is
intent
to
the
contrary.
when
you
look
at
thorpe,
there
are
two
things
i
would
invite
the
court’s
attention
to.
the
court
there
went
and
construed
the
regulation
involved,
the
hud
regulation
involved
and
after
construing
it
as
applying
to
all
tenants
still
residing
in
the
project,
this
is
an
ejectment
suit,
eviction
under
housing
act,
it
then
decided
that
it
applied
to
this
lady
whose
litigation
was
then
in
process.
in
addition,
thorpe
is
one
of
those
cases
that
we
members
of
the
bar
have
a
hard
time
determining
the
proper
scope
of
for
the
reason
that,
in
thorpe,
this
court
judiciously
avoided
a
fundamental
question
of
due
process
by
a
very
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
regulation
before
it.
so
much
for
the
first
reason
for
not
applying
section
718,
another
one
is
well
stated
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
johnson
versus
combs
and
i
will
read
just
a
portion
of
the
quotation.
it’s
found
on
--
“to
apply
this
statute
retroactively
would
place
a
wholly
unexpected
and
unwarranted
burden
on
these
districts
who
have
done
no
more
than
litigate
what
they
in
good
faith
believe
to
be
demands
which
exceeded
the
constitution’s
demands.”
this
rationale
is
expanded,
but
time
does
not
permit
me
to
read
any
more
from
it,
but
that
is
the
second
ground
that
has
been
use
as
the
basis
for
not
applying
section
718
to
pre-swan
services.
and,
as
i’ve
mentioned
earlier,
the
fifth
circuit
reaffirmed
the
same
standard
for
pre-swan
services
even
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
northcross
and
in
hall
v.
cole,
they
did
that
in
henry
versus
clarksdale.
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
sir.
i
think
when
you’re
in
the
area
of
procedure,
i
think
any
change
on
procedure
other
than
a
juris
--
if
you
--
i’m
using
the
term
very
restrictively
as
procedure,
as
long
as
it
doesn’t
affect
jurisdiction
of
court,
as
procedure
i
think
there
would
be
less
hesitancy
to
apply
it
to
every
pending
case.
mr.
george
b.
little
sir,
i
think
that
the
way
the
analogy
has
to
be
the
section
718,
what
is
it
in
that
that
gives
rise
to
an
attorney’s
fees?
and,
this
brings
me
right
to
this
point
of
another
basis
for
not
applying
and
that
is
the
entry
of
an
order
of
compliance,
in
other
words,
an
order
necessary
for
compliance.
and,
the
fourth
circuit
of
course
said
while
there
was
no
order
of
compliance
on
appeal
or
that
was
even
pending
at
the
time
of
the
effective
date
of
section
718,
and
that
is
another
basis.
but
i
think
the
true
test,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
how
do
we
say
that
congress,
knowing
that
this
rule
of
obdurate
obstinacy,
has
prevailed
uniformly
throughout
the
country
in
five
circuits
and,
how
many
district
courts,
i
don’t
know,
that
they
would
come
in
and
enact
the
statute
intending
to
cover
services
rendered
prior
to
its
effective
date.
i
have
very
great
difficulty
in
thinking
that
congress
intended
to
bring
about
a
lot
of
re-litigation
because
bear
in
mind,
school
desegregation
suits
are
unique
in
another
sense.
adhering
to
the
admonishments
of
this
court,
these
cases
are
still
within
the
realm
of
pending
cases.
there
are
a
great
many
school
desegregation
cases,
of
course,
still
pending
on
the
dockets.
this
court’s
decision
in
this
case
will
certainly
have
a
bearing
on
whether
or
not
this
whole
question
of
attorney’s
fees
can
be
reopened
om
a
great
many
other
desegregation
cases.
mr.
george
b.
little
no
order
--
the
fourth
circuit
draws
a
distinction,
mr.
justice
white,
between
there
was
no
order
compliance
pending
at
the
date
this
act
became
effective
because
the
last
order
--
mr.
george
b.
little
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
if
the
--
no,
i’m
not
saying
that,
sir.
no,
i’m
not
--
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
they
had
requested
that
right
at
the
outset.
mr.
george
b.
little
pending
on
the
issue
of
attorney’s
fees,
it
was,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
little
right,
sir.
then
you
have
to
go
to
the
congressional
intent
--
mr.
george
b.
little
that
i
say
you
have
to,
under
the
rule
of
peggy
schooner
and
thorpe
that
you
start
with
a
presumption
against
retroactivity.
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
sir.
i
rely
on
us
versus
laramie
stock
yards
and
greene
for
the
rule,
but
i’m
trying
to
relate
united
states
versus
schooner
peggy
and
thorpe
to
the
normal
rule
of
prospective
application
absent
clear
and
unambiguous
intent
to
the
contrary.
mr.
george
b.
little
what
--
may
i
have
that
again,
sir,
i’m
sorry?
mr.
george
b.
little
no,
sir,
but
i
find
this.
i
don’t
--
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that,
in
thorpe,
this
case
intended
to
modify
the
normal
rule
of
prospective
application
without
even
referring
to
the
rule.
i
have
great
difficulty
there.
i
would
like
to
summarize,
if
i
may.
our
disagreement
with
the
petitioners
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it
is
not
any
basic
difference
of
philosophy
regarding
the
propriety
of
fee
shifting
in
civil
rights
cases.
indeed,
we
feel
that
the
trend
in
congress
and
in
the
courts
to
expand
the
concept
of
fee
shifting
in
these
cases
is
probably
long
overdue.
and,
normally,
the
standards
embodied
in
section
718
as
construed
by
this
court
in
northcross
and
under
other
sections
of
the
civil
rights
act
are
fully
appropriate,
but
this
is
where
we
have
trouble.
we
have
trouble
and
we
must
question
whether
conscientious
school
boards
laboring
in
the
struggling
in
the
sea
of
pre-swan
uncertainty,
and
that’s
what
it
was,
may
it
please
the
court,
regardless
of
how
conscientious
the
school
board
was,
should
be
held
to
be
in
the
same
legal
shoes
as
those
who
callously
deny
explicit
rights
in
such
areas
as
public
accommodation
and
housing
and
employment.
the
expansion
and
extension
of
the
doctrine
of
mills
and
newman
and
hall
v.
cole,
we
think,
is
fully
appropriate
to
many
forms
of
the
civil
rights
actions
which
are
being
brought
under
section
1983.
but
we
say
that
they
--
such
an
expansion
is
not
warranted
in
pre-swan
school
desegregation
litigation
because
of
the
complexities
which
necessitated
the
evolutionary
development
of
remedies
in
school
desegregation.
we
say
that
this
record
exonerates
the
school
board
under
the
obdurate
obstinacy
standard
and
certainly,
would
render
the
imposition
of
a
stigma
of
bad
faith
unjustified.
admittedly,
upholding
the
award
under
section
718
or
under
any
other
theory
while
more
palatable
would
be
incorrect
for
the
reasons
cited
and
would
also
create
quite
an
inequity
of
subjecting
these
respondents,
this
school
board
as
being
the
only
school
board
in
this
country
that
is
ever
been
held
to
that
standard
for
pre-swan
litigation.
