this
case
involves
questions
under
a
village
ordinance
enacted
in
new
york
villages,
village
of
belle
terre
on
long
island.
it
is
a
small
village
of
about
700
people.
it
has
an
ordinance
that
restricts
an
area
to
family
resident
roots.
it
includes
in
the
definition
of
the
word
‘family’,
one
or
more
persons
related
by
blood,
adoption
or
marriage,
and
also
two
unrelated
persons
living
and
cooking
together
as
a
single
housekeeping
unit.
the
owner
of
the
house
in
question,
leased
it
to
six
college
students
who
were
not
related,
and
the
proceeding
is
brought
ahead
for
violation,
starting
the
violation
of
the
ordinance.
hence,
this
action
was
then
brought
to
declare
the
ordinance
unconstitutional
if
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
other
constitutional
rights.
the
district
court
held
the
ordinance
unconstitutional
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
have
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
this
zoning
ordinance
is
lower
than
the
limits
of
the
police
power.
it’s
not
countered
upon
the
racial
basis
and
not
involving
a
discrimination
in
a
constitutional
sense.
the
views
are
expressed
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
separated
dissenting
opinion.
