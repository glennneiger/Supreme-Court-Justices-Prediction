mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
belle
terre
ordinance
which
is
challenged
here
and
which
was
invalidated
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
is,
in
many
respects,
an
extraordinary
piece
of
municipal
legislation.
it’s
important
at
the
outset,
i
think,
to
recognize
what
the
belle
terre
ordinance
is
not.
it
is
not
an
ordinance
of
the
kind
which
this
court
validated
in
its
sweeping
decision
in
euclid
versus
ambler,
and
it
is
not
in
like
fashion
an
ordinance
of
the
character
which
has
received
widespread
acceptance
a
tradition
of
comprehensive
local
zoning
as
taken
hold
in
this
country
as
a
result
of
this
court’s
euclid
decision.
it
is
different
because
it
in
no
sense,
purports
to
segregate
incompatible
physical
uses
of
land
or
to
encourage
the
productive
use
of
land.
what
this
ordinance
does
in
its
substantial
purpose,
in
its
operative
criterion,
and
in
its
effect
is
to
exclude
persons
who
are
regarded
as
uncongenial
from
a
community,
and
exclude
them
not
merely
on
the
basis
of
a
random
criterion
of
uncongeniality,
but
on
the
basis
of
a
criterion
of
deeply
personal
choice,
namely
a
person’s
choice
of
household
associates.
in
justification
of
its
ordinance
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
--
that
is
our
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
under
our
argument,
essentially,
the
village
has
proffered
two
characters
of
legitimating
interests.
on
the
one
hand,
they’ve
proffered
an
interest
and
they
acknowledge
this
candidly,
your
honor,
in
social
and
in
creating
a
socially
homogeneous
community
and,
on
the
other
hand
they’ve
proffered
the
more
orthodox
interest
which
they’ve
expressed
an
oral
argument
before
you.
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
simply,
first,
that
the
creation
of
socially
homogeneous
enclaves
is
not
a
legitimate
interest
of
government
and,
second
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
if
this
ordinance
bears
no
rational
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
interest
which
have
been
discussed
before
this
court.
now
to
get
--
and
i’m
sorry
that
i
deferred
your
question.
in
the
situation
involving
a
boarding
house,
it’s
entirely
possible
in
most
communities
that
there
would
be
substantial
legitimate
governmental
interests
justifying
the
prohibition
of
a
boarding
house.
this
is
not
such
a
situation
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
yes,
your
honor.
this
was
the
point
made
by
justice
rehnquist
in
argument
yesterday.
it’s
interesting
to
note,
however,
if
you
refer
to
the
appellants’
brief
in
this
case
at
page
30,
the
appellants
give
their
explanation
for
permitting
an
unrelated
household
of
two
persons,
and
that
explanation
makes
it
perfectly
plain
that
they
regard
this
as
a
grudging
exception
which
violates
their
basic
policy
of
excluding
unrelated
persons.
their
rationale
expressed
on
page
30,
in
essence,
runs
as
follows.
we
recognize
that,
says
the
village,
that
there
may
be
some
single
persons
who
own
a
house
in
belle
terre
by
themselves
and
we
think
it
would
be
unjust
to
make
them
move,
and
we’re
concerned
that
they
may
be
lonely
and
so
we
permit
them
to
have
one
associate.
now,
i
don’t
criticize
the
policy,
let
me
make
clear,
of
allowing
two
unrelated
persons,
but
i
do
want
to
make
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
village
by
its
own
description,
of
its
reason
for
this
exception
to
the
exclusion
of
single
families,
does
not
purport
to
be
saying
“yes,
we
in
fact
like
single
--
a
traditional
--
untraditional
household
groups,
but
we
want
to
regulate
their
size,”
rather,
it
says
“we
want
to
keep
unrelated
persons
who
form
households
of
such
persons
out
of
this
community,
but
we
realize
the
equities
become
so
great
in
some
situations
that
we
make
an
exception.”
that’s
the
village’s
own
characterization
of
that,
accepting,
your
honor,
not
mine.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
again,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
in
each
instance
would
be
at
a
minimum
as
in
any
governmental
classification
which
deprives
a
given
group
of
people
of
a
substantial
benefit.
is
there
a
legitimate
interest
which
substantiates
or
supports
or
justifies
this
classification?
i
think
in
the
case
of
a
fraternity
house,
in
many
communities
there
might
indeed
be
such
legitimate
interests.
there
might
be
serious
concerns
about
the
supply
of
parking,
for
example.
there
might
be
other
legitimate
concerns.
where
those
concerns
existed,
our
quarrel
with
such
legislation
would
largely
cease.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
in
this
instance,
your
honor,
there
are
several
important
reasons,
i
think,
for
believing
that
this
ordinance
does
not
rationally
advance.
first,
that
this
ordinance
does
not
advance
any
such
concern
and,
secondly,
that
the
village
has
no
such
concern.
if
i
can
start
with
the
second
half
of
that
argument,
this
village
has
220
homes
distributed
over
an
area
of
more
than
a
square-mile.
the
present
density
of
population
in
the
village
of
belle
terre
is
1.1
persons
per
acre,
an
extraordinary
low
density.
parking
by
the
village
ordinance,
which
we
cite
to
this
court,
i
believe
at
page
53
of
our
brief,
parking
by
virtue
of
the
village
ordinance
is
prevented
on
any
street
of
the
village.
at
this
time,
there
are
no
cars
parked
on
the
streets
of
the
village.
for
these
220
homes
and
700
people,
there
are
4
municipal
parking
lots
provided.
there
is
absolutely
no
showing
that
this
village
has
or
has
ever
had
any
concern
with
a
parking
problem
of
any
kind,
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
where
we
confronted
with
a
village
which
had
a
parking
concern
that
this
ordinance
would
in
any
way
rationally
advance
that
interest.
the
parking
argument,
among
other
things,
is
tied
of
course
to
the
argument
which
mr.
gegan
made
yesterday
concerning
the
density
of
population,
and
i’d
like
to
examine
that
argument
briefly
for
a
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
--
well,
let
me
say
that
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
relationship
between
parking
and
the
relationship
with
the
people
who
live
in
a
house,
it
must
turn
on
one
of
two
suppositions,
neither
of
which
i
think
is
accurate.
either
that
more
people
will
live
in
belle
terre
if
this
ordinance
is
invalidated
or
if
this
ordinance
did
not
exist,
or
that
more
people
who
drive
cars
will
live
in
belle
terre.
i
don’t
think
either
supposition
can
be
sustained.
on
the
first
question
of
whether
more
people
will
live
in
the
village,
let
me
make
perfectly
plain
what
this
ordinance
permits
and
what
it
prohibits.
it
permits
any
number
of
persons
related
by
blood
or
adoption
or
marriage
to
live
in
a
household
unit.
they
may
be
related
by
any
remote
degree
of
consanguinity
as
in
--
as
the
--
in
their
own
brief
the
appellants
admit
they
may
be
brothers,
sisters,
cousins,
grandfathers,
or
uncles.
moreover,
under
this
ordinance,
they
may
have,
living
in
their
household,
any
number
of
household
servants
whatsoever.
they
may
have,
in
other
words,
more
household
servants
that
may
live
under
an
unrelated
household
independently
in
the
village.
so,
an
extraordinarily
large
number
of
people
may
live
in
a
house
of
any
size
in
the
village
of
belle
terre
if
they
bear
the
magical
relationship
of
familial
ties.
if
they
do
not,
three
persons
violate
this
ordinance,
three
spinsters,
as
was
suggested
yesterday,
three
school
teachers
or,
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
noted,
three
judges
violate
this
ordinance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
if
by
single-family
zone,
what
one
means
is
detached
residential
dwellings
on
individual
parcels
of
land.
nothing
in
the
attack
which
we
have
successfully
mounted
below
on
this
ordinance
and
press
here,
nothing
whatsoever
speaks
to
the
invalidity
of
detached
single-family
dwellings.
we
challenge
merely
the
notion
that
a
community
can
say
who
will
occupy
those
houses
and
moreover,
that
they
can
select
a
criterion
of
household
association
in
soats
against
osang
(ph).
that’s
solely
the
attack
we
make
on
this
ordinance,
and
we
don’t
intend
and
i
don’t
believe
our
attack
has
any
implications
which
speak
to
the
invalidity
of
single-family
dwellings
in
residential
communities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
if
by
single-family
zone
one
means
to
characterize
the
household
unit
in
terms
of
the
kind,
the
quality
of
the
relationship
which
exists
between
those
people,
and
particularly
to
draw
on
a
delicate
choice
like
that
of
living
or
not
living
with
one
to
whom
one
is
related
by
familial
ties,
to
that
extent,
necessarily,
we
attack
the
single-family
residence
zone
only
if
that’s
what
one
means
by
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
that’s
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
yes,
although
i
--
just
to
be
perfectly
accurate
about
what
this
ordinance
does,
your
honor,
it
is
not
restricted
to
what
i
think
sociologists
would
characterize
as
a
nuclear
family
because
the
familial
bond
which
satisfies
this
test
can
be
a
good
deal
more
remote
than
the
nuclear
family.
it
can
be,
for
example,
a
remote
pleasant
unrelated
grandfather.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
tribal
terms,
may
be
more
accurate,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
they
do
not.
i
think
we
would
have
to
ask
whose
definition
was
being
drawn
on,
your
honor.
by
sociologists’
definitions,
i’m
not
sure.
by
the
village
of
belle
terre,
certainly
not,
by
mine,
they
certainly
formed
a
single-housekeeping
unit.
as
a
practical
matter,
they
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
they
are
not
what
i
would
call
a
family,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
well,
many
of
those
ordinances
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
it
depends
very
much
on
how
those
ordinances
are
read.
ordinances
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
many
state
courts
confronted
with
ordinances
like
that
have
said
that
groups
like
these
students
may
live
in
such
a
community.
it
depends
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
many
state
courts
have
held
so,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
a
substantial
number.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
over
two.
i
can’t
give
you
the
exact
number.[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
wouldn’t
quarrel
and
the
appellees
would
not
quarrel,
your
honor,
with
any
ordinance
that
imposed
reasonable
occupancy
standards
in
terms
of
numbers
on
household
residencies,
and
did
so
not
merely
to
people
who
are
unrelated
by
blood,
adoption,
or
marriage,
but
across
the
board.
many
communities
in
the
united
states,
for
example,
have
addressed
the
problem
which
we
don’t
believe
the
village
possess
or
was
addressing
here
of
density
by
–
by
stipulating
density
of
occupancy
on
the
basis
either
of
the
square
feet
of
dwellings
or
on
the
basis
of
the
number
of
bedrooms
in
a
household
unit.
such
a
neutral
standard,
we
spoke
not
to
the
kind
of
person
who
lived
in
a
community,
but
to
the
extent
to
which
they
adequately
or
used
or
surcharged
the
residential
facilities
in
that
community,
we
would
and
could
have
no
quarrel
with
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
well
except,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
this
village
or
another
community
wanted
to,
it
could
also
regulate
the
size
of
its
houses.
i
mean,
the
community
has
at
its
disposal
simple
constitutional
and
socially
unobjectionable
ways
of
securing
the
end
of
regulating
density.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
they
would,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
–
i
think
your
honor,
that
if
density
were
a
serious
concern
of
a
community,
it
could
certainly
impose
standards
which
would
secure
a
maximum
density
in
the
community
in
this
way,
it
could
permit
very
large
structures
for
families
or
other
groups
in
so
doing.
let
me
say
that,
and
make
perfectly
clear
because
i
think
the
argument
of
the
appellants
here
has
been
a
little
misleading.
this
ordinance
has
been
justified
below
and
justified
in
the
brief
by
the
appellants
here
on
two
very
different
kinds
of
grounds.
and,
it’s
critical
i
think
to
separate
out
those
grounds
and
to
delineate
the
two
different
positions
that,
as
appellees,
we
take
to
each
of
those
grounds.
on
the
one
hand,
the
village
has
candidly
acknowledged
that
it
intended,
as
it
clearly
must
have
when
it
passed
this
ordinance,
to
project
into
law
the
social
preferences
of
the
residents
of
the
village
of
belle
terre
for
a
socially
homogeneous
community,
for
a
community
in
which
neighboring
households
would
be
exclude
--
would
be
comprised
exclusively
of
traditional
families,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
community
has
argued
that
very
much
more
orthodox
interests
such
as
density
of
population,
transiency
of
population,
and
red
level
support
this
ordinance.
now,
as
to
the
former
we
claim,
and
i
believe
that
this
is
the
crux
of
the
case,
that
it
is
simply
not
a
legitimate
interest
of
government
to
divide
this
society
into
socially
homogeneous
residential
enclaves.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
socially
homogeneous
families?
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
your
honor
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
there
are
no
restrictions
on
what
kinds
of
families
may
enter
this
community.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
don’t
think
i
can,
your
honor.
the
village
clearly,
by
its
own
statements,
hopes
that
the
kinds
of
people
who
share
these
ties
of
blood,
marriage,
or
adoption
will
in
some
way
comprise
households
which
are
more
congenial
to
the
present
residents
of
the
village.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i’m
not
sure,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
question
may
--
one
may
have
to
ask
a
question
which
precedes
the
discussion
of
what
a
family
is,
namely
whether
community
should
be
allowed
to
divide
themselves
into
enclaves
for
families
however
divided,
into
enclaves
for
single
people.
village,
since
the
establishment
of
comprehensive
municipal
land
use
regulation
in
this
country,
there
have
been
a
variety
of
attempts
which
sound
of
the
quality
of
the
belle
terre
ordinance.
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
the
physically
or
psychologically
infirmed,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
the
old,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
the
young,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
families
with
children,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
families
without
children,
and
the
village
of
belle
terre
and
some
other
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
those
people
who
form
a
household
whose
ties
do
not
enjoy
the
familial
blood,
marriage,
or
adoption
part.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
just
unrelated
people.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
very
different
case
from
the
ones
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think,
your
honor,
as
this
court
has
made
clear
as
recently
as
its
decision
in
weber
versus
edna,
the
government
clearly
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
the
preservation
of
the
nuclear
family.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
absolutely.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
it
has,
your
honor.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
village’s
ordinance
in
any
way
speaks
to
the
preservation
of
the
nuclear
family.
all
that
the
village
has
argued
that
this
does,
vice
versa
the
nuclear
family,
is
to
provide
the
nuclear
family
with
residential
neighbors
who
are
similar
to
it
in
being
nuclear
families.
how
this
speaks
to
the
preservation
of
the
institution
of
the
family
is
not
something
which
i
think
is
clear
or
defensible
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
no,
and
we
certainly
don’t,
your
honor.
as
regards
the
argument
which
has
been
advanced
by
the
village
in
terms
of
pricing
the
families
out
of
the
market,
there
are
several
propositions
which
i’d
like
to
make
very
clear
because
i
think
the
village
has
failed
entirely
to
demonstrate
either
that
this
possibility
exists
in
belle
terre
or
that
this
ordinance
in
any
way
would
address
such
a
possibility.
let
me
make
clear
the
state
of
the
record
on
this
matter.
first
of
all,
there’s
no
indication
whatsoever
that
in
this
small
middle
class
suburban
community
that
there
are
any
substantial
number
of
rental
units
available
at
all.
in
their
canvas
of
the
belle
terre
community,
in
their
one
affidavit
speaking
to
this
question,
the
village
was
able
to
come
up
with
only
two
other
houses
available
for
rental
other
than
the
dickman
house
which
was
the
original
subject
of
this
litigation
below.
so,
this
is
a
village
which,
in
all
probability,
does
not
today
and
will
not
in
the
future
have
any
substantial
number
of
rental
units
available
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
your
honor,
there’s
no
indication
in
the
record
and
i
think
that
--
and
no
intuitive
justification
for
the
proposition
that
six
students
occupying
a
house
are
going
to
be
willing
or
able
to
spend
any
more
than
the
middle
class
families
that
live
in
belle
terre
today.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
your
honor,
if
there
was
a
shred
of
ev
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
three
judges
or
five
judges
might,
your
honor,
although
it’s
–
it's
significant
to
note
that
by
the
village’s
own
definition
of
its
perception
of
the
problem,
it
was
a
student
population
that
it
was
concerned
with
and
not
a
set
of
wage
earners
that
it
was
concerned
with
in
this
instance.
your
honor,
in
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
response
to
your
question,
i
think
that
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
village
could
have
shown
itself
to
have
in
any
sense
perceived,
examined,
analyzed
the
existence
of
a
problem,
namely
that
there
was
an
inadequate
supply
in
the
village
or
in
the
region
in
which
it’s
a
part
of
single-family
homes
for
single
families,
in
that
situation
and
in
the
situation
where
there
was
some
coordinated
effort
on
the
part
of
the
village
and
other
communities
to
adjust
to
this
need,
i
would
say
that
this
was
entirely
the
kind
of
governmental
judgment
which
could
be
made.
there
is,
however,
in
the
record
absolutely
no
indication
that
the
village
had
this
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
ordinance,
that
it
examined
the
situation,
or
that
it
set
out
to
adjust
this
need.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
don’t
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
there
is
a
strong
presumption
and
a
justifiable
presumption
of
their
validity,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
to
hold
that
in
this
case
would
in
any
sense
threaten
that
presumption
because,
again,
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
you
have
here
a
situation
where
an
ordinance
by
its
operative
criterion
addresses
itself
to
the
kind
of
person
who
lives
in
a
community
and
where
the
village,
by
its
own
admission,
has
as
a
primary
interest
the
exclusion
of
uncongenial
households.
in
this
situation,
it
seems
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
no,
then
i
think
one
could
address
density
very
much
more
on
the
merits
if
one
had
an
ordinance
which
was
--
which
by
its
terms,
was
rationally
adopted
to
addressing
the
density
problem.
i
think
one
would
have
a
totally
different
case
here.
what
i
think
we
have
here
is
a
case
that
is
very
much
like
this
court’s
decision
in
department
of
agriculture
versus
moreno
and
very
much
like
this
court’s
decision
in
its
--
in
the
recent
lafleur
case
and,
in
particular,
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
the
lafleur
case.
in
this
important
respect,
you
have
here
an
obvious,
and
also
i
should
say
this
court’s
decision
i
think
in
eisenstadt
versus
baird,
you
have
here
a
case
where
the
obvious
primary
and
dominant
motivation
of
the
community
was
one
which
is
either
patently
invalid
or
highly
suspect,
and
you
have
here
what
i
think
we
must
agree
or
really,
to
use
mr.
justice
powell’s
term,
after
the
fact
rationalizations
for
this
ordinance.
now,
if
this
court
adopts
literally
the
language
of
mcgowan
or
the
lindsley
case,
long
before
mcgowan,
in
addressing
these
after
the
fact
rationalizations,
then
what
--
what
really
happens
is
that
an
ordinance
motivated
and
admittedly
motivated
by
what
i
think
this
court
must
conclude
as
a
legitimate
--
as
an
illegitimate
interest
of
government
will
necessarily
pass
constitutional
ordinance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
the
illegitimate
interest
is
that
in
creating
a
socially
homogeneous
community
by--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
no,
but
what
they
must
be,
your
honor,
is,
in
every
case,
families.
on
page
25
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
--
of
the
appellants’
brief,
they
lead
out
in
describing
the
motivation
of
this
ordinance
with
the
conclusion
that
what
is
involved
here
is
a
social
preference
in
favor
of
promoting
and
supporting
family
organization
through
residential
proximity.
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
just
wanted
to
go
on
to
say
that
is,
i
think,
significant
to
note,
and
i
have
not
yet
said
it,
that
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
ordinance
was
not
rationally
related
to
any
of
these
orthodox
interests,
be
they
density,
transiency,
or
rent
level.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
concurred
in
that
judgment.
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
substantial
analytical
disparity
between
the
position
of
the
district
judge
and
the
majority
below,
but
the
one
thing
they
had
in
common
was
a
complete
and
comfortable
rejection
of
the
view
that
these
more
orthodox
interests
of
government
could
be
the
basis
for
justifying
this
ordinance.
their
discrepancy
was
in
the
district
judge’s
perception
that
the
interest
in
having
families
and
in
having
family
organization
was
a
justifiable
interest,
and
the
court
of
appeals
concluding
that
that
had
no
place
in
a
–
in
a
unit
or
subdivision
of
government
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
i
think
it’s
critical
to
examine
the
more
orthodox
or
traditional
interests
which
are
proffered,
but
critical
to
examine
them
only
to
realize
that
they
are
indeed
after
the
fact
rationalizations
of
an
ordinance
which
should
rise
or
fall
on
very
different
constitutional
grounds,
i
think.
i
think
with
the
aid
of
your
questioning,
i
addressed
two
of
the
governmental
interests
which
the
village
has
advanced,
namely
density,
where
i’ve
tried
to
show
that
the
community
has
no
density
problem.
it’s
a
fully
developed
community.
it
could
regulate
over
crowding
of
its
facilities
comfortably
if
it
wished,
and
it
presently
enjoys
or
suffers
a
density
of
population
of
1.1
persons
per
acre.
there’s
no
demonstration
whatsoever
that
in
1971,
when
this
ordinance
was
adopted
late
in
1971,
there
was
any
reason
that
this
community
feared
or
could
have
feared
a
sudden
influx
or
change
in
population
and,
more
importantly,
even
if
it
could,
i
hope
that
i’ve
demonstrated
that
this
is
an
utterly
hopelessly
crude
and
arbitrary
way
of
achieving
it.
the
one
fact
which
i
did
not
mention
in
this
connection
is
that
census
data
indicates
that
far
from
the
intuitive
proposition
that
somehow
families
are
self-regulating
and
unrelated
households
are
not,
that
the
average
size
of
families
is
considerably
larger
than
the
average
size
of
unrelated
households
and
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
throughout
the
country.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
the
census
data,
your
honor,
is
not
broken
down
by
community
that
we
have.
however,
it
is
broken
down
by
kind
of
community
and
it’s
very
plain
that
these
figures
hold
for
suburban
communities
on
the
urban
fringe
like
belle
terre,
as
well
as
for
the
city,
as
well
as
for
the
rural
areas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
1.1.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
that
it
may
be
very
sensible
to
eliminate
certain
patent
high
density
uses
under
certain
circumstances
where
reasonable
densities
are
at
stake.
the
actual
numbers
as
involved,
i
think
i’d
have
to
consider
much
more
closely.
i
don’t
think,
however,
that
unlike
the
boarding
house
and
the
fraternity
house
that,
in
any
way,
one
rationally
addresses
density
of
population
by
speaking
to
the
familial
tie
that
exists
between
the
residents
of
a
household
in
letting
in
any
number
of
household
servants
on
the
one
hand,
any
number
of
people
related
by
this
tie
on
the
other
hand,
and
then
choosing
the
number
like
two
on
the
other
hand.
i
think
it’s
also
important
to
note
that
the
number
“two”
not
merely
is
unusually
low
in
this
regard
and,
therefore,
makes
the
ordinance
in
some
sense
less
rational.
it
seems
to
me,
it
supports
strongly
the
view
that
his
ordinance
was
not
designed
in
any
sense
to
regulate
density
of
population.
the
choice
of
the
number
“two”
i’ve
already
described
to
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
i
would,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
we’re
relying,
your
honor,
primarily
on
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
let
met
make
clear
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
well,
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses.
the
reason
i’m
so
guarded
in
that
statement
is
in
addressing,
as
your
honor
knows,
in
addressing
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
a
legitimate
governmental
interest,
we
–
we
make
substantial
reference
and
rely
heavily
on
the
rights
of
privacy
and
the
right
of
travel
and
while
this
court
has
indicated
a
strong
tendency
to
found
those
very
explicit
--
now
explicitly
recognized
and
well-articulated
rights
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
think
that
this
court
has
avoided
ever
firmly
concluding
the
debate
as
to
precisely
where
the
right
of
travel
and
right
of
privacy
derived
their
force
from
in
the
constitution,
and
i
certainly
would
be
hesitant
to
reading
more
explicit
than
this
court
has
been
on
that
subject.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
don’t
think
it
has.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think,
however,
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
this
court
specifically
has
skewed
finding
a
specific
location
for
the
right
of
travel
at
all.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
belle
terre
ordinance
which
is
challenged
here
and
which
was
invalidated
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
is,
in
many
respects,
an
extraordinary
piece
of
municipal
legislation.
it’s
important
at
the
outset,
i
think,
to
recognize
what
the
belle
terre
ordinance
is
not.
it
is
not
an
ordinance
of
the
kind
which
this
court
validated
in
its
sweeping
decision
in
euclid
versus
ambler,
and
it
is
not
in
like
fashion
an
ordinance
of
the
character
which
has
received
widespread
acceptance
a
tradition
of
comprehensive
local
zoning
as
taken
hold
in
this
country
as
a
result
of
this
court’s
euclid
decision.
it
is
different
because
it
in
no
sense,
purports
to
segregate
incompatible
physical
uses
of
land
or
to
encourage
the
productive
use
of
land.
what
this
ordinance
does
in
its
substantial
purpose,
in
its
operative
criterion,
and
in
its
effect
is
to
exclude
persons
who
are
regarded
as
uncongenial
from
a
community,
and
exclude
them
not
merely
on
the
basis
of
a
random
criterion
of
uncongeniality,
but
on
the
basis
of
a
criterion
of
deeply
personal
choice,
namely
a
person’s
choice
of
household
associates.
in
justification
of
its
ordinance
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
--
that
is
our
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
under
our
argument,
essentially,
the
village
has
proffered
two
characters
of
legitimating
interests.
on
the
one
hand,
they’ve
proffered
an
interest
and
they
acknowledge
this
candidly,
your
honor,
in
social
and
in
creating
a
socially
homogeneous
community
and,
on
the
other
hand
they’ve
proffered
the
more
orthodox
interest
which
they’ve
expressed
an
oral
argument
before
you.
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
simply,
first,
that
the
creation
of
socially
homogeneous
enclaves
is
not
a
legitimate
interest
of
government
and,
second
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
if
this
ordinance
bears
no
rational
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
interest
which
have
been
discussed
before
this
court.
now
to
get
--
and
i’m
sorry
that
i
deferred
your
question.
in
the
situation
involving
a
boarding
house,
it’s
entirely
possible
in
most
communities
that
there
would
be
substantial
legitimate
governmental
interests
justifying
the
prohibition
of
a
boarding
house.
this
is
not
such
a
situation
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
yes,
your
honor.
this
was
the
point
made
by
justice
rehnquist
in
argument
yesterday.
it’s
interesting
to
note,
however,
if
you
refer
to
the
appellants’
brief
in
this
case
at
page
30,
the
appellants
give
their
explanation
for
permitting
an
unrelated
household
of
two
persons,
and
that
explanation
makes
it
perfectly
plain
that
they
regard
this
as
a
grudging
exception
which
violates
their
basic
policy
of
excluding
unrelated
persons.
their
rationale
expressed
on
page
30,
in
essence,
runs
as
follows.
we
recognize
that,
says
the
village,
that
there
may
be
some
single
persons
who
own
a
house
in
belle
terre
by
themselves
and
we
think
it
would
be
unjust
to
make
them
move,
and
we’re
concerned
that
they
may
be
lonely
and
so
we
permit
them
to
have
one
associate.
now,
i
don’t
criticize
the
policy,
let
me
make
clear,
of
allowing
two
unrelated
persons,
but
i
do
want
to
make
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
village
by
its
own
description,
of
its
reason
for
this
exception
to
the
exclusion
of
single
families,
does
not
purport
to
be
saying
“yes,
we
in
fact
like
single
--
a
traditional
--
untraditional
household
groups,
but
we
want
to
regulate
their
size,”
rather,
it
says
“we
want
to
keep
unrelated
persons
who
form
households
of
such
persons
out
of
this
community,
but
we
realize
the
equities
become
so
great
in
some
situations
that
we
make
an
exception.”
that’s
the
village’s
own
characterization
of
that,
accepting,
your
honor,
not
mine.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
again,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
in
each
instance
would
be
at
a
minimum
as
in
any
governmental
classification
which
deprives
a
given
group
of
people
of
a
substantial
benefit.
is
there
a
legitimate
interest
which
substantiates
or
supports
or
justifies
this
classification?
i
think
in
the
case
of
a
fraternity
house,
in
many
communities
there
might
indeed
be
such
legitimate
interests.
there
might
be
serious
concerns
about
the
supply
of
parking,
for
example.
there
might
be
other
legitimate
concerns.
where
those
concerns
existed,
our
quarrel
with
such
legislation
would
largely
cease.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
in
this
instance,
your
honor,
there
are
several
important
reasons,
i
think,
for
believing
that
this
ordinance
does
not
rationally
advance.
first,
that
this
ordinance
does
not
advance
any
such
concern
and,
secondly,
that
the
village
has
no
such
concern.
if
i
can
start
with
the
second
half
of
that
argument,
this
village
has
220
homes
distributed
over
an
area
of
more
than
a
square-mile.
the
present
density
of
population
in
the
village
of
belle
terre
is
1.1
persons
per
acre,
an
extraordinary
low
density.
parking
by
the
village
ordinance,
which
we
cite
to
this
court,
i
believe
at
page
53
of
our
brief,
parking
by
virtue
of
the
village
ordinance
is
prevented
on
any
street
of
the
village.
at
this
time,
there
are
no
cars
parked
on
the
streets
of
the
village.
for
these
220
homes
and
700
people,
there
are
4
municipal
parking
lots
provided.
there
is
absolutely
no
showing
that
this
village
has
or
has
ever
had
any
concern
with
a
parking
problem
of
any
kind,
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
where
we
confronted
with
a
village
which
had
a
parking
concern
that
this
ordinance
would
in
any
way
rationally
advance
that
interest.
the
parking
argument,
among
other
things,
is
tied
of
course
to
the
argument
which
mr.
gegan
made
yesterday
concerning
the
density
of
population,
and
i’d
like
to
examine
that
argument
briefly
for
a
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
--
well,
let
me
say
that
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
relationship
between
parking
and
the
relationship
with
the
people
who
live
in
a
house,
it
must
turn
on
one
of
two
suppositions,
neither
of
which
i
think
is
accurate.
either
that
more
people
will
live
in
belle
terre
if
this
ordinance
is
invalidated
or
if
this
ordinance
did
not
exist,
or
that
more
people
who
drive
cars
will
live
in
belle
terre.
i
don’t
think
either
supposition
can
be
sustained.
on
the
first
question
of
whether
more
people
will
live
in
the
village,
let
me
make
perfectly
plain
what
this
ordinance
permits
and
what
it
prohibits.
it
permits
any
number
of
persons
related
by
blood
or
adoption
or
marriage
to
live
in
a
household
unit.
they
may
be
related
by
any
remote
degree
of
consanguinity
as
in
--
as
the
--
in
their
own
brief
the
appellants
admit
they
may
be
brothers,
sisters,
cousins,
grandfathers,
or
uncles.
moreover,
under
this
ordinance,
they
may
have,
living
in
their
household,
any
number
of
household
servants
whatsoever.
they
may
have,
in
other
words,
more
household
servants
that
may
live
under
an
unrelated
household
independently
in
the
village.
so,
an
extraordinarily
large
number
of
people
may
live
in
a
house
of
any
size
in
the
village
of
belle
terre
if
they
bear
the
magical
relationship
of
familial
ties.
if
they
do
not,
three
persons
violate
this
ordinance,
three
spinsters,
as
was
suggested
yesterday,
three
school
teachers
or,
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
noted,
three
judges
violate
this
ordinance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
if
by
single-family
zone,
what
one
means
is
detached
residential
dwellings
on
individual
parcels
of
land.
nothing
in
the
attack
which
we
have
successfully
mounted
below
on
this
ordinance
and
press
here,
nothing
whatsoever
speaks
to
the
invalidity
of
detached
single-family
dwellings.
we
challenge
merely
the
notion
that
a
community
can
say
who
will
occupy
those
houses
and
moreover,
that
they
can
select
a
criterion
of
household
association
in
soats
against
osang
(ph).
that’s
solely
the
attack
we
make
on
this
ordinance,
and
we
don’t
intend
and
i
don’t
believe
our
attack
has
any
implications
which
speak
to
the
invalidity
of
single-family
dwellings
in
residential
communities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
if
by
single-family
zone
one
means
to
characterize
the
household
unit
in
terms
of
the
kind,
the
quality
of
the
relationship
which
exists
between
those
people,
and
particularly
to
draw
on
a
delicate
choice
like
that
of
living
or
not
living
with
one
to
whom
one
is
related
by
familial
ties,
to
that
extent,
necessarily,
we
attack
the
single-family
residence
zone
only
if
that’s
what
one
means
by
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
that’s
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
yes,
although
i
--
just
to
be
perfectly
accurate
about
what
this
ordinance
does,
your
honor,
it
is
not
restricted
to
what
i
think
sociologists
would
characterize
as
a
nuclear
family
because
the
familial
bond
which
satisfies
this
test
can
be
a
good
deal
more
remote
than
the
nuclear
family.
it
can
be,
for
example,
a
remote
pleasant
unrelated
grandfather.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
tribal
terms,
may
be
more
accurate,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
they
do
not.
i
think
we
would
have
to
ask
whose
definition
was
being
drawn
on,
your
honor.
by
sociologists’
definitions,
i’m
not
sure.
by
the
village
of
belle
terre,
certainly
not,
by
mine,
they
certainly
formed
a
single-housekeeping
unit.
as
a
practical
matter,
they
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
they
are
not
what
i
would
call
a
family,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
well,
many
of
those
ordinances
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
it
depends
very
much
on
how
those
ordinances
are
read.
ordinances
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
many
state
courts
confronted
with
ordinances
like
that
have
said
that
groups
like
these
students
may
live
in
such
a
community.
it
depends
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
many
state
courts
have
held
so,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
a
substantial
number.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
over
two.
i
can’t
give
you
the
exact
number.[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
wouldn’t
quarrel
and
the
appellees
would
not
quarrel,
your
honor,
with
any
ordinance
that
imposed
reasonable
occupancy
standards
in
terms
of
numbers
on
household
residencies,
and
did
so
not
merely
to
people
who
are
unrelated
by
blood,
adoption,
or
marriage,
but
across
the
board.
many
communities
in
the
united
states,
for
example,
have
addressed
the
problem
which
we
don’t
believe
the
village
possess
or
was
addressing
here
of
density
by
–
by
stipulating
density
of
occupancy
on
the
basis
either
of
the
square
feet
of
dwellings
or
on
the
basis
of
the
number
of
bedrooms
in
a
household
unit.
such
a
neutral
standard,
we
spoke
not
to
the
kind
of
person
who
lived
in
a
community,
but
to
the
extent
to
which
they
adequately
or
used
or
surcharged
the
residential
facilities
in
that
community,
we
would
and
could
have
no
quarrel
with
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
well
except,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
this
village
or
another
community
wanted
to,
it
could
also
regulate
the
size
of
its
houses.
i
mean,
the
community
has
at
its
disposal
simple
constitutional
and
socially
unobjectionable
ways
of
securing
the
end
of
regulating
density.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
they
would,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
–
i
think
your
honor,
that
if
density
were
a
serious
concern
of
a
community,
it
could
certainly
impose
standards
which
would
secure
a
maximum
density
in
the
community
in
this
way,
it
could
permit
very
large
structures
for
families
or
other
groups
in
so
doing.
let
me
say
that,
and
make
perfectly
clear
because
i
think
the
argument
of
the
appellants
here
has
been
a
little
misleading.
this
ordinance
has
been
justified
below
and
justified
in
the
brief
by
the
appellants
here
on
two
very
different
kinds
of
grounds.
and,
it’s
critical
i
think
to
separate
out
those
grounds
and
to
delineate
the
two
different
positions
that,
as
appellees,
we
take
to
each
of
those
grounds.
on
the
one
hand,
the
village
has
candidly
acknowledged
that
it
intended,
as
it
clearly
must
have
when
it
passed
this
ordinance,
to
project
into
law
the
social
preferences
of
the
residents
of
the
village
of
belle
terre
for
a
socially
homogeneous
community,
for
a
community
in
which
neighboring
households
would
be
exclude
--
would
be
comprised
exclusively
of
traditional
families,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
community
has
argued
that
very
much
more
orthodox
interests
such
as
density
of
population,
transiency
of
population,
and
red
level
support
this
ordinance.
now,
as
to
the
former
we
claim,
and
i
believe
that
this
is
the
crux
of
the
case,
that
it
is
simply
not
a
legitimate
interest
of
government
to
divide
this
society
into
socially
homogeneous
residential
enclaves.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
socially
homogeneous
families?
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
your
honor
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
there
are
no
restrictions
on
what
kinds
of
families
may
enter
this
community.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
don’t
think
i
can,
your
honor.
the
village
clearly,
by
its
own
statements,
hopes
that
the
kinds
of
people
who
share
these
ties
of
blood,
marriage,
or
adoption
will
in
some
way
comprise
households
which
are
more
congenial
to
the
present
residents
of
the
village.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i’m
not
sure,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
question
may
--
one
may
have
to
ask
a
question
which
precedes
the
discussion
of
what
a
family
is,
namely
whether
community
should
be
allowed
to
divide
themselves
into
enclaves
for
families
however
divided,
into
enclaves
for
single
people.
village,
since
the
establishment
of
comprehensive
municipal
land
use
regulation
in
this
country,
there
have
been
a
variety
of
attempts
which
sound
of
the
quality
of
the
belle
terre
ordinance.
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
the
physically
or
psychologically
infirmed,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
the
old,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
the
young,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
families
with
children,
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
families
without
children,
and
the
village
of
belle
terre
and
some
other
communities
have
attempted
to
exclude
those
people
who
form
a
household
whose
ties
do
not
enjoy
the
familial
blood,
marriage,
or
adoption
part.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
just
unrelated
people.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
very
different
case
from
the
ones
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think,
your
honor,
as
this
court
has
made
clear
as
recently
as
its
decision
in
weber
versus
edna,
the
government
clearly
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
the
preservation
of
the
nuclear
family.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
absolutely.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
it
has,
your
honor.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
village’s
ordinance
in
any
way
speaks
to
the
preservation
of
the
nuclear
family.
all
that
the
village
has
argued
that
this
does,
vice
versa
the
nuclear
family,
is
to
provide
the
nuclear
family
with
residential
neighbors
who
are
similar
to
it
in
being
nuclear
families.
how
this
speaks
to
the
preservation
of
the
institution
of
the
family
is
not
something
which
i
think
is
clear
or
defensible
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
no,
and
we
certainly
don’t,
your
honor.
as
regards
the
argument
which
has
been
advanced
by
the
village
in
terms
of
pricing
the
families
out
of
the
market,
there
are
several
propositions
which
i’d
like
to
make
very
clear
because
i
think
the
village
has
failed
entirely
to
demonstrate
either
that
this
possibility
exists
in
belle
terre
or
that
this
ordinance
in
any
way
would
address
such
a
possibility.
let
me
make
clear
the
state
of
the
record
on
this
matter.
first
of
all,
there’s
no
indication
whatsoever
that
in
this
small
middle
class
suburban
community
that
there
are
any
substantial
number
of
rental
units
available
at
all.
in
their
canvas
of
the
belle
terre
community,
in
their
one
affidavit
speaking
to
this
question,
the
village
was
able
to
come
up
with
only
two
other
houses
available
for
rental
other
than
the
dickman
house
which
was
the
original
subject
of
this
litigation
below.
so,
this
is
a
village
which,
in
all
probability,
does
not
today
and
will
not
in
the
future
have
any
substantial
number
of
rental
units
available
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
your
honor,
there’s
no
indication
in
the
record
and
i
think
that
--
and
no
intuitive
justification
for
the
proposition
that
six
students
occupying
a
house
are
going
to
be
willing
or
able
to
spend
any
more
than
the
middle
class
families
that
live
in
belle
terre
today.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
your
honor,
if
there
was
a
shred
of
ev
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
three
judges
or
five
judges
might,
your
honor,
although
it’s
–
it's
significant
to
note
that
by
the
village’s
own
definition
of
its
perception
of
the
problem,
it
was
a
student
population
that
it
was
concerned
with
and
not
a
set
of
wage
earners
that
it
was
concerned
with
in
this
instance.
your
honor,
in
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
response
to
your
question,
i
think
that
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
village
could
have
shown
itself
to
have
in
any
sense
perceived,
examined,
analyzed
the
existence
of
a
problem,
namely
that
there
was
an
inadequate
supply
in
the
village
or
in
the
region
in
which
it’s
a
part
of
single-family
homes
for
single
families,
in
that
situation
and
in
the
situation
where
there
was
some
coordinated
effort
on
the
part
of
the
village
and
other
communities
to
adjust
to
this
need,
i
would
say
that
this
was
entirely
the
kind
of
governmental
judgment
which
could
be
made.
there
is,
however,
in
the
record
absolutely
no
indication
that
the
village
had
this
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
ordinance,
that
it
examined
the
situation,
or
that
it
set
out
to
adjust
this
need.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
don’t
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
there
is
a
strong
presumption
and
a
justifiable
presumption
of
their
validity,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
to
hold
that
in
this
case
would
in
any
sense
threaten
that
presumption
because,
again,
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
you
have
here
a
situation
where
an
ordinance
by
its
operative
criterion
addresses
itself
to
the
kind
of
person
who
lives
in
a
community
and
where
the
village,
by
its
own
admission,
has
as
a
primary
interest
the
exclusion
of
uncongenial
households.
in
this
situation,
it
seems
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
no,
then
i
think
one
could
address
density
very
much
more
on
the
merits
if
one
had
an
ordinance
which
was
--
which
by
its
terms,
was
rationally
adopted
to
addressing
the
density
problem.
i
think
one
would
have
a
totally
different
case
here.
what
i
think
we
have
here
is
a
case
that
is
very
much
like
this
court’s
decision
in
department
of
agriculture
versus
moreno
and
very
much
like
this
court’s
decision
in
its
--
in
the
recent
lafleur
case
and,
in
particular,
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
the
lafleur
case.
in
this
important
respect,
you
have
here
an
obvious,
and
also
i
should
say
this
court’s
decision
i
think
in
eisenstadt
versus
baird,
you
have
here
a
case
where
the
obvious
primary
and
dominant
motivation
of
the
community
was
one
which
is
either
patently
invalid
or
highly
suspect,
and
you
have
here
what
i
think
we
must
agree
or
really,
to
use
mr.
justice
powell’s
term,
after
the
fact
rationalizations
for
this
ordinance.
now,
if
this
court
adopts
literally
the
language
of
mcgowan
or
the
lindsley
case,
long
before
mcgowan,
in
addressing
these
after
the
fact
rationalizations,
then
what
--
what
really
happens
is
that
an
ordinance
motivated
and
admittedly
motivated
by
what
i
think
this
court
must
conclude
as
a
legitimate
--
as
an
illegitimate
interest
of
government
will
necessarily
pass
constitutional
ordinance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
the
illegitimate
interest
is
that
in
creating
a
socially
homogeneous
community
by--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
no,
but
what
they
must
be,
your
honor,
is,
in
every
case,
families.

mr.
lawrence

sager

of
the
appellants’
brief,
they
lead
out
in
describing
the
motivation
of
this
ordinance
with
the
conclusion
that
what
is
involved
here
is
a
social
preference
in
favor
of
promoting
and
supporting
family
organization
through
residential
proximity.
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
just
wanted
to
go
on
to
say
that
is,
i
think,
significant
to
note,
and
i
have
not
yet
said
it,
that
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
ordinance
was
not
rationally
related
to
any
of
these
orthodox
interests,
be
they
density,
transiency,
or
rent
level.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
concurred
in
that
judgment.
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
substantial
analytical
disparity
between
the
position
of
the
district
judge
and
the
majority
below,
but
the
one
thing
they
had
in
common
was
a
complete
and
comfortable
rejection
of
the
view
that
these
more
orthodox
interests
of
government
could
be
the
basis
for
justifying
this
ordinance.
their
discrepancy
was
in
the
district
judge’s
perception
that
the
interest
in
having
families
and
in
having
family
organization
was
a
justifiable
interest,
and
the
court
of
appeals
concluding
that
that
had
no
place
in
a
–
in
a
unit
or
subdivision
of
government
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
i
think
it’s
critical
to
examine
the
more
orthodox
or
traditional
interests
which
are
proffered,
but
critical
to
examine
them
only
to
realize
that
they
are
indeed
after
the
fact
rationalizations
of
an
ordinance
which
should
rise
or
fall
on
very
different
constitutional
grounds,
i
think.
i
think
with
the
aid
of
your
questioning,
i
addressed
two
of
the
governmental
interests
which
the
village
has
advanced,
namely
density,
where
i’ve
tried
to
show
that
the
community
has
no
density
problem.
it’s
a
fully
developed
community.
it
could
regulate
over
crowding
of
its
facilities
comfortably
if
it
wished,
and
it
presently
enjoys
or
suffers
a
density
of
population
of
1.1
persons
per
acre.
there’s
no
demonstration
whatsoever
that
in
1971,
when
this
ordinance
was
adopted
late
in
1971,
there
was
any
reason
that
this
community
feared
or
could
have
feared
a
sudden
influx
or
change
in
population
and,
more
importantly,
even
if
it
could,
i
hope
that
i’ve
demonstrated
that
this
is
an
utterly
hopelessly
crude
and
arbitrary
way
of
achieving
it.
the
one
fact
which
i
did
not
mention
in
this
connection
is
that
census
data
indicates
that
far
from
the
intuitive
proposition
that
somehow
families
are
self-regulating
and
unrelated
households
are
not,
that
the
average
size
of
families
is
considerably
larger
than
the
average
size
of
unrelated
households
and
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
throughout
the
country.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
the
census
data,
your
honor,
is
not
broken
down
by
community
that
we
have.
however,
it
is
broken
down
by
kind
of
community
and
it’s
very
plain
that
these
figures
hold
for
suburban
communities
on
the
urban
fringe
like
belle
terre,
as
well
as
for
the
city,
as
well
as
for
the
rural
areas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
1.1.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
that
it
may
be
very
sensible
to
eliminate
certain
patent
high
density
uses
under
certain
circumstances
where
reasonable
densities
are
at
stake.
the
actual
numbers
as
involved,
i
think
i’d
have
to
consider
much
more
closely.
i
don’t
think,
however,
that
unlike
the
boarding
house
and
the
fraternity
house
that,
in
any
way,
one
rationally
addresses
density
of
population
by
speaking
to
the
familial
tie
that
exists
between
the
residents
of
a
household
in
letting
in
any
number
of
household
servants
on
the
one
hand,
any
number
of
people
related
by
this
tie
on
the
other
hand,
and
then
choosing
the
number
like
two
on
the
other
hand.
i
think
it’s
also
important
to
note
that
the
number
“two”
not
merely
is
unusually
low
in
this
regard
and,
therefore,
makes
the
ordinance
in
some
sense
less
rational.
it
seems
to
me,
it
supports
strongly
the
view
that
his
ordinance
was
not
designed
in
any
sense
to
regulate
density
of
population.
the
choice
of
the
number
“two”
i’ve
already
described
to
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think
i
would,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
we’re
relying,
your
honor,
primarily
on
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
let
met
make
clear
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
well,
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses.
the
reason
i’m
so
guarded
in
that
statement
is
in
addressing,
as
your
honor
knows,
in
addressing
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
a
legitimate
governmental
interest,
we
–
we
make
substantial
reference
and
rely
heavily
on
the
rights
of
privacy
and
the
right
of
travel
and
while
this
court
has
indicated
a
strong
tendency
to
found
those
very
explicit
--
now
explicitly
recognized
and
well-articulated
rights
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
think
that
this
court
has
avoided
ever
firmly
concluding
the
debate
as
to
precisely
where
the
right
of
travel
and
right
of
privacy
derived
their
force
from
in
the
constitution,
and
i
certainly
would
be
hesitant
to
reading
more
explicit
than
this
court
has
been
on
that
subject.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
don’t
think
it
has.
mr.
lawrence
g.
sager
i
think,
however,
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
this
court
specifically
has
skewed
finding
a
specific
location
for
the
right
of
travel
at
all.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
