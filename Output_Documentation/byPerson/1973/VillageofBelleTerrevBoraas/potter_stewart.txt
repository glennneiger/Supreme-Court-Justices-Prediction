justice
potter
stewart
and
the
students
were
all
unrelated
to
each
other
by
blood
or
marriage,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
were
--
some
were
males,
some
were
females,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
whole
village
zoned
as
one-family?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
would
you
--
under
your
view,
would
--
could
somebody
open
rooming
house
and
this
constitute
--
would
have
the
constitutional
right
in
spite
this
zoning
ordinance
to
open
a
rooming
house?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not
under
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
say
that
the
village
cannot
define
the
family.
that
you
can
define
it
any
way
you
want
so
long
as
you
live
in
a
detached
house,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
to
that
extent,
it
is
a
general
attack
of
the
kind
that
suggested
in
the
question
of
my
brother
powell?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
the
village,
in
this
case
at
least,
has
no
constitutional
power
to
define
the
family
the
way,
at
least,
the
way
they
did.
justice
potter
stewart
you
cannot
confine
it
to,
i
think,
what
sociologists
now
call
a
nuclear
family,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
tribal
--
they
can’t
just
define
it
in
tribal
terms.
justice
potter
stewart
by
your
definition,
they
do,
don’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
village
might
find
it
very
socially
unobjectionable
to
penalize
an
impoverished
large
family
by
saying
that
you
couldn’t
be
--
have
more
than
one
child
in
a
room
or
something
like
that.
the
village
might
find
that
intolerable
as
a
matter
of
social
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
i
don’t
--
i
think
you’re
quite
wrong
in
indicating
this
would
be
very
easy
for
one
to
do
as
an
alternatives?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
a
quite
different
case.
it’s
a
very
interesting
case,
but
quite
different
ones,
the
ones
you
just
talked
about.
belle
terre
hasn’t
presumed
to
exclude
children
or
old
people
or
young
people.
justice
potter
stewart
or
people
of
any
particular
race
or
anything
else.
this
is
quite
a
different
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
government
has
no
interest
in
the
preservation
of
the
nuclear
family?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
that’s
what
all
their
laws
of
--
civil
laws
about
marriage
and
divorce
and
child
dependency
and
all
domestic
relation
law
is
all
about.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
been
a
--
for
centuries,
it’s
been
considered
a
legitimate
interest
of
government,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
argument
is
that
you’re
pricing
families
out
of
the
market
in
belle
terre.
you’re
familiar
with
your
brother’s
argument.
you
can’t
disregard
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
know
that
would
overrule
euclid
against
ambler,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
whole
doctrine
of
the
presumption
of
the
validity
of
zoning
laws.
there
is
a
presumption
of
their
validity,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
this
illegitimate
interest?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there’s
no
restriction
on
good
families
or
bad
families
or
law
abiding
families
or
criminal
families
or
poor
families
or
rich
families.
there’s
nothing
--
i
don’t
understand
your
brother
even
implicitly
to
concede
that
that
was
the
motivation
behind
this
ordinance
and,
demonstratively,
it
isn’t.
there’s
nothing
about
the
families
having
to
be
compatible
or
homogeneous
or
all
upper
middle
class
or
all
lower
middle
class
or
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
right.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
never
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
what
provision,
specifically
of
the
constitution,
are
you
relying
on?
justice
potter
stewart
due
process
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don’t
think
the
courts
have
said
that
the
right
of
interstate
commerce
was
not
derived
from
the
fourteenth
amendment,
hasn't
the
court
said
that?
justice
potter
stewart
in
olmstead
against
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
argument,
i
suppose,
any
law
would
interfere
a
right
to
travel.
you’d
say
i
--
it
impairs
my
right
to
travel
to
this
place
because
they
have
a
law
here
that
i
don’t
like?
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
then
there’s
nothing
in
your
ordinance
that
prevents
two
students
from
coming
in
and
renting
a
house?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
students
were
all
unrelated
to
each
other
by
blood
or
marriage,
were
they
not?
justice

and
they
