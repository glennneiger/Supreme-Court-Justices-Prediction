well
here,
you
don't
have
an
exclusion
of
unrelated
groups,
at
least
as
i
understand
the
ordinance.
you
have
a
limitation
on
their
number
as
to
two
where
you
don't
have
the
same
limitation
on
the
number
in
the
family,
that
the
town
hasn't
excluded
unrelated
groups.

be
serious
concerns

you
have
six

each

might

their

in

you
succeed

well,

the

the
question

whether

might

justice

that
isn’t
the
test.
as
i
understand
under
economic
equal
protection,
the
test
is
whether
the
legislative
body
under
any
hypothesis
could
have
rationally
conceived
this
to
be
the
case.
i
don’t
believe,
