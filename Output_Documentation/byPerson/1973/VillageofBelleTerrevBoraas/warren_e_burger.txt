chief

it
is
not
a
class
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
house
is
occupied
by
these
people
or
by
no
one
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
the
same
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
village
have
a
legal
right
to
grant
variations
or
exceptions
from
their
zoning
for
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
to
suggest
one,
six
completely
independent
autonomous
adults
are
more
likely
to
have
more
automobiles
and
use
up
more
parking
space
than
one
family
unit
with
two
children,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
this
one
of
the
basis
on
which
the
zoning
ordinances
will
require
x
number
of
square
feet
parking
space
for
every
x
number
of
living
space
in
an
apartment
building
so
that
persons
living
nearby
in
the
apartment
are
not
going
to
be
having
their
space
on
the
street
taken
up
by
the
overflow
from
the
apartment
building.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that'd
be
true
in
a
lesser
degree
right
here,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
mcgowan
or
up
to
now,
hasn't
mcgowan
against
maryland
said
that
an
appellate
court
may
conjure
up
any
reason
that
supports
the
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
at
that
point
at
ten
o’clock
in
the
morning,
gentleman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we’ll
resume
arguments
in
village
of
belle
terre
against
boraas.
mr.
gegan,
i
think
you
have
about
10
minutes
remaining
all
together.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
sager.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sager,
i’m
not
sure
i
attract
your
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question,
but
let
me
try
another
one
that
might
be
somewhat
like
it.
what
about
a
fraternity
house?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
the
limit
on
the
numbers?
we
have
six
in
this
case,
haven’t
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
12,
would
you
make
the
same
arguments
with
respect
to
12?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
take
it,
your
answer
is
that
if
the
house
is
large
enough,
you’d
be
making
these
same
arguments
with
the
community
group
of
12,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
community?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
were
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
city
council
then
or
the
zoning
board,
the
governments,
in
laying
out
their
plan
for
this
kind
of
a
city
said
“our
objective
is
to
try
to
maintain
not
more
than
an
average
of
three
per
household
acre
and
that
while
we
may
not
be
able
to
achieve
it
perfectly,
that’s
our
objective.”
that
being
articulated,
do
you
say
that
their
density
now
is
1.5?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
1.1
per
acre,
so
they’ve
come
well
under
the
three
that
i
postulate.
then,
you
say
that’s
not
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
to
say
that
one
way
to
keep
that
in
control
is
to
eliminate
boarding
houses
or
fraternity
houses
and
households
of
unrelated
people
more
than
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
sager.
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.

you,

the
case
