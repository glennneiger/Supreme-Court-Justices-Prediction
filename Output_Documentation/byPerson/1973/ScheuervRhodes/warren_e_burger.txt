mr.

chief

warren
e.

very
well.
mr.
alloway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
specific
item
you’ve
just
mentioned,
namely
the
burning
of
the
rotc
building?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
a
legal
conclusion
not
a
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
sindell,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
suggest
that
he
has
an
obligation
to
ask
you
for
more.
he
can
stand
on
your
complaint
and
if
he
thinks
it’s
infirm,
then
that’s
what
the
defense
counsel
does,
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
like
to
find
out
whether
your
allegations
are
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-914,
scheuer
against
rhodes.
mr.
geltner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven’t
mentioned
moyer
against
peabody
or
cited
it
in
your
brief.
i
take
it,
you
think
that
there’s
not
much
left
of
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
reply?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
must
be
in
your
reply
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
don’t
trouble
yourself
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
couldn’t
find
it
in
your
index.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
geltner.
mr.
brown.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
will
pick
up
at
that
point
after
lunch,
mr.
brown.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
brown,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
one
difference
would
be
that
anyone
can
start
any
kind
of
a
frivolous
lawsuit
to
get
an
indictment,
you’ve
got
to
go
through
a
grand
jury.
one
of
the
historic
purposes
of
a
grand
jury
was
to
be
a
buffer
against
frivolous
irresponsible
charges,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
moyer
against
peabody
was
under
the
civil
rights
act,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
sterling
case
would
be
an
example
of
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
protects
this
case
where
the
injunction
suit
was
brought
to
prevent
the
enforcement
of
a
statute
that
had
previously
been
if,
as
i
recall
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
previously
declared
unconstitutional.
the
governor
was
applying
and
notwithstanding
the
court's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
appears
on
an
examination
of
moyer
against
peabody
that
that
was
brought
under
1983
in
the
federal
court
by
the
gentleman
who
was
imprisoned
for
two
or
three
months.
so,
there
was
the
same
kind
of
an
action
as
we
have
here.
i
guess
there
are
no
further
questions.
thank
you,
mr.
brown.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
geltner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
expressions
that
the
action
of
the
governor
in
colorado
calling
out
the
guard
was
an
unreviewable
action.
that
was
dictum
by
justice
holmes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it’s
in
the
case,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
consider
it
a
showing
of
negligence
meeting
the
standards
you
have
just
suggested
if
the
evidence
was
that
the
governor
had
signed
the
proclamation
for
calling
out
the
guards
or
signing
the
order
on
the
basis
of
newspaper
accounts
as
to
what
was
happening
down
in
some
southern
county
in
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
agree
with
justice
--
i
don’t
remember
whether
it
was
justice
marshall
or
justice
powell,
it
seems
to
me,
you
indicated
that
negligence
in
traditional
sense
would
be
enough
to
support
liability
of
the
governor,
and
i
thought
you
had
indicated
negligence
in
calling
out
the
guard
would
be
one
of
those
areas.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
didn’t
understand
mr.
brown
to
be
worried
about
the
courts.
i
understood
him
to
be
concerned
about
the
governors
or
mayors
or
individuals,
including
judges,
who
would
have
to
take
time
off
from,
among
other
things,
from
their
duties
to
defend
the
suit
and
be
in
state
of
apprehension
as
they
approached
the
decisional
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
for
the
court

announce
in
number
72-914,
scheuer,
administratrix
against
rhodes,
and
72-1318,
krause
as
administrator
against
rhodes.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning,
the
judgment
took
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
reversed,
