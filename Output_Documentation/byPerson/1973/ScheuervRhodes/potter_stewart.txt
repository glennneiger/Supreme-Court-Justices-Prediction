justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
the
complaint,
the
allegation
was
that
he
ordered
out
the
national
guard
onto
that
campus
at
a
time
when
he
knew
--
when
he
himself
knew
or
should
have
known
that
arming
them
with
live
ammunition
and
sending
them
there
in
their
state
of
training
was
an
imminent
danger
to
the
lives
of
the
students
on
that
campus
and
that’s
alleging
personal
culpability
on
his
part
not
on
any
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior.
isn’t
that
correct
under
this
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
because
we’re
dealing
mr.
alloway,
are
we
not,
with
the
allegations
of
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
in
its
present
posture
under
well
settled
principles
of
law,
we
must
assume
they’re
all
true.
all
those
well
pleaded
allegations
are
true
in
facts,
that’s
correct,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
what
i
said
is
generally
accepted.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
claim
of
your
brother
on
the
other
side
is
that
a
very
serious
error
was
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
when
they
disregarded
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
instead
called
upon
what
they
understood
to
be
their
personal
knowledge
or
judicial
knowledge
of
what
the
true
facts
were
and
that
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
violated
what
you
and
i
have
just
agreed
is
a
fundamental,
very
elementary
principle
of
law
that
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
well-pleaded
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
assumed
to
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
far
as
that
go.
i
can
understand
that
if
a
complaint
depended
upon
the
plaintiff's
allegation
and
he
was
napoleon
bonaparte,
for
example
that
a
court
could
assume
that
probably
wasn’t
true,
but
beyond
the
extreme
cases
like
that,
how
many
exceptions
are
there
to
this
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
may
well
all
be
very
true,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
but
we
have
here
a
lawsuit
in
which
a
complaint
was
filed,
making
certain
allegations
which
as
i
read
them
are
not
emotionally
charged
allegations.
they
are
very
serious
allegations
and
a
motion
to
dismiss.
what
you
say
may
all
be
very
true,
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
they
all
come
out
in
the
trial,
but
this
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
and
isn’t
--
didn’t
the
court
err
in
saying,
“well,
whatever
the
complaint
may
say,
we
know
that
the
real
facts
are
such
and
such
and
therefore,
the
district
court
was
correct
in
dismissing
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
eleventh
amendment
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
wasn’t
an
eleventh
amendment
case,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
the
eleventh
amendment
or
you’ve
moved
on
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
--
you
say
then
that
there
is
not
immunity
if
it’s
an
injunction,
an
action
for
an
injunction,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
an
immunity
only
exists
--
the
immunity
exists
only
when
the
action
is
for
money
damages?
justice
potter
stewart
the
distinction
that
my
brother
blackmun
asked
you
about
is
not
the
distinction
you
make.
it’s
not
as
between
an
injunction
and
the
damages?
