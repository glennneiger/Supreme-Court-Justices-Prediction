mr.
charles
e.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
such
as
they
go
to
very
heart
of
federalism.
they
go
to
the
very
delicate
balance
between
our
form
of
government,
and
the
issue
is
can
federal
courts
control
the
administration
of
state
law?
i
respectfully
disagree
with
mr.
governor
as
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
in
our
judgment,
that
is
a
very
important
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
below,
that
is
the
district
court,
at
the
time
we
filed
our
motion
to
dismiss
under
the
eleventh
amendment
and
as
this
court
well
knows,
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
not
only
to
suits
by
the
citizens
of
one
state
against
another
state,
but
the
citizens
of
a
state
against
its
own
state
which
is
the
case
here
at
bar.
at
the
time
we
filed
our
motion
to
dismiss,
there
was
pending
before
the
district
judge
an
affidavit
of
general
del
corso
that
he
was
not
at
the
scene,
an
affidavit
from
general
canterbury
that
he
gave
no
order
for
anyone
to
fire,
and
there
was
the
executive
proclamation
of
governor
rhodes
that
a
riotous
condition,
insurrection,
if
you
will,
existed
in
the
city
in
county
--
city
of
state
and
the
kent
state
university
area.
pursuant
to
that,
the
national
guard
was
called
out.
now
at
this
point,
under
ohio
statutes,
the
members
of
the
ohio
national
guard
had
no
choice.
they,
of
course,
had
to
go.
they
were
ordered
to
go.
it
is
important
to
note,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that,
before
this
court
today,
we
do
not
have
the
issue
of
the
ohio
national
guard.
there
are
seven
named
defendants,
and
those
are
the
only
people
before
the
court
today
and
not
the
entire
ohio
national
guard.
now
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
12
(b)
(1)
motion
to
dismiss
which
goes
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
and
of
course
as
this
court
well
knows
the
12
(b)
(6)
motion
goes
with
the
question
of
whether
a
cause
of
action
is
stated.
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
suit
is
in
fact
against
the
state,
you
look
behind
the
nominal
parties
defendant
named
and
look
at
what
is
the
essential
nature
and
effect
of
the
lawsuit.
now,
this
test
was
first
set
out
by
the
--
was
set
out
by
this
court
in
the
ford
case.
dugan
versus
rank,
which
is
a
1963
decision
from
this
court,
defines
when
a
state
is
affected.
and
if
a
state
is
in
fact
affected,
then
you
look
behind
the
nominal
parties
defendant
and
determine
that
it
is
a
state
against
the
--
a
suit
against
the
sub.
and
in
dugan
versus
rank
this
court
stated,
if
the
judgment
sought
would
expend
itself
on
the
public
treasury
or
domain
or
interfere
with
the
public
administration
or
in
the
--
if
the
effect
of
the
judgment
would
be
to
restrain
the
government
from
acting
or
to
compel
it
to
act,
then
the
act
is
considered
as
to
be
one
against
the
state.
now,
we
submit
here
that
the
seven
named
defendants
are
nominal
parties
only
and
that
this
action
is
in
fact
one
against
the
state
of
ohio.
now,
the
case
of
barr
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
the
sterling
case
is
distinguishable.
that
is
an
injunction
action,
your
honor,
to
enforce
an
unconstitutional
statute.
now,
we
don’t
have
that
situation
here.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you.
i
don’t
believe
the
court
said
that.
i
think
what
the
court
said,
because
you
have
an
unconstitutional
statute,
you
don’t
have
the
state
acting,
therefore,
it
isn’t
the
state
acting.
the
state
cannot
enforce
an
unconstitutional
statute.
now,
as
i
read
the
decision,
i
think
that’
what
you
said.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
if
we
were
acting
under
unconstitutional
statute,
your
honor.
there
is
a
difference,
if
i
may
say,
between
stating
a
cause
of
action
and
jurisdiction.
i’m
not
too
stating
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
definite
distinction
in
my
opinion.
and,
i’m
saying
here
that
if
the
seven
named
defendants
were
acting
under
a
constitutional
warrant
at
the
time
and
there
is
no
allegation
or
challenge
to
the
contrary
by
the
petitioners
and
if
they
were
acting
within
the
delegation
of
that
statutory
warrant,
then
they
are
agents
of
the
sovereign
and
the
action
may
not
be
maintained.
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
and
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
your
honor,
i
would
get
to
the
cause
of
action
discussion
later
as
it
relates
to
the
doctrine
of
executive
immunity.
but
this
court
in
barr,
in
quoting
from
gregoire,
adopted
his
--
judge
hand’s
reasoning
and
logic
to
the
effect
that
if
actions
are
permitted
to
be
maintained
against
state
officials,
then
you
will
have
times
when
a
state
official
will
abuse
his
power.
there
will
go
un-redressed
some
wrongs,
but
you
must
weigh
the
equities
which
is
more
important.
this
is
a
pragmatic,
a
public
policy
argument,
if
you
will.
and
for
example,
to
illustrate
that
point,
as
mr.
chief
justice
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
in
moyer
versus
martin
we
have
the
question
of
calling
out
the
national
guard.
justice
holmes
wrote
the
decision
in
that
case.
this
court
held
that
the
calling
out
of
the
national
guard
was
not
reviewable
and
justice
holmes
stated
“as
no
one
would
deny
that
there
was
immunity
for
ordering
a
company
fire
on
a
mob
in
insurrection
and
that
a
state
law
authorizing
the
governor
to
deprive
citizens
of
life
under
such
circumstances
was
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
same
is
true
of
a
law
authorizing
by
implication
what
was
done
in
this
case.”
and
in
that
particular
case,
perhaps
a
man
was
unconstitutionally
deprived
of
his
liberty.
he
was
put
in
jail
for,
i
think,
two-and-a
half
months,
but
this
court
held
that
the
discretion
of
the
executive
branch
of
a
state
government
in
calling
out
the
national
guard
is
his
discretion.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
that
was
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
alright.
now,
the
petitioners
on
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
rely
on
sterling,
ex
parte
young,
those
kinds
of
cases,
all
of
which
are
distinguishable
in
our
opinion
because
we’re
talking
about
unconstitutional
statutes.
and
in
sterling,
before
the
governor
called
out
the
guard,
the
federal
court
had
already
enjoined
the
matter.
so,
he
was
flying
right
in
the
face
of
an
order
of
a
federal
court
at
that
time.
the
larson
case
applied
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
agents
of
the
sovereign
were
immune
even
if
their
actions
at
the
time
were
ultra
virus.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
going
further
on
my
jurisdictional
argument
as
to
whether
the
court
below
under
rule
12
(b)
(1)
had
jurisdiction,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that,
contrary
to
what
my
imminent
opponent
stated.
sterling
versus
constantin
did
not
in
fact
overruled
moyer,
it
cited
it
with
approval
and
stated
they
were
dealing
with
a
different
situation
there,
taking
of
property.
moving
on
now
to
the
effect
test,
that
is
if
the
nature
of
the
lawsuit
even
though
naming
nominal
parties
as
defendant
in
fact
affects
state
government,
then
it
is
an
action
against
the
state.
and
this
court
in
dugan
versus
rank,
which
is
a
1963
decision,
stated
the
test.
the
general
rule
is
that
if
suit
is
against
the
sovereign,
if
the
judgment
sought
would
expend
itself
on
the
public
treasury,
domain,
or
interfere
with
the
administration
of
justice,
if
the
effect
of
the
judgment
would
be
to
restrain
government
from
acting
or
to
compel
it
to
act.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
we’re
talking
about
here.
granted,
the
dugan
case
is
a
federal
government
case.
but
which
is
more
important,
the
constitutionally
granted
rights
to
the
states,
that
is,
the
eleventh
amendment,
or
the
common
law
interpretation
of
the
immunity
of
a
federal
government?
along
that
same
line,
as
this
court
well
knows
in
barr
versus
matteo,
they
quoted,
with
approval,
judge
learned
hand
in
gregoire
versus
biddle
and
i’d
like
to
quote
a
part
of
judge
hand’s
opinion.
“again
and
again,
the
public
interest
calls
for
action
which
may
turn
out
to
be
found
on
a
mistake,
in
the
face
of
which,
an
official
may
later
find
himself
hard
put
to
satisfy
a
jury
of
his
good
faith,
the
answer
must
be
found
in
a
balance
between
the
evils
inevitable
in
either
alternative.”
in
this
instance,
it
has
been
thought
in
the
end
better
to
leave
un-redressed
the
wrongs
done
by
dishonest
officers
than
to
subject
those
who
try
to
do
their
duty
to
the
constant
dread
of
retaliation.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
exactly
a
situation
with
which
we
are
here
confronted.
what
would
be
the
effect
on
state
officials
in
every
state
of
the
union
if
federal
court
would
be
granted
jurisdiction
in
this
kind
of
a
situation?
any
vituperative,
vindictive,
plaintiff
wanting
to
vent
his
spleen
on
a
state
official
could
file
a
lawsuit.
you
could
literally
tie
up
state
governments,
just
mimeograph
thousands
of
lawsuits
against
all
kinds
of
people
and
tie
up
state
government.
that
is
exactly
how
it
could
be
affected.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not,
but
the
same
reasoning
would
apply,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.
that
is
true,
yes
sir.
let’s
just
take
a
specific
example
of
a
national
guardsman
in
any
state
in
the
union
called
to
act
of
duty,
to
quell
riot,
insurrection,
what
have
you?
if
he
knew
that
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
as
he
was
commanded
to
do
by
the
governor
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
his
commanding
officers
that
he
could
be
sued,
would
he
diligently
carry
out
his
duties?
this
is
a
very
pragmatic
policy
consideration.
should
officials,
all
state
officials,
be
free
to
carryout
their
duties
unhindered
and
unhampered
or
should
they
live
in
constant
fear
of
being
sued?
we
feel,
as
did
judge
hand,
that
they
must
be
free
to
carryout
their
duties.
now
clearly,
does
that
leave
people
without
a
remedy?
if
you
have
a
dishonest
official
or
somebody
acting
vindictively?
it
does
not
because
they
are
still
subject
to
the
electoral
process
and
they
can
be
recalled
from
office.
in
conclusion,
therefore,
on
the
12
(b)
(1)
motion
on
jurisdiction,
we
clearly
feel
the
courts
below
were
correct
in
their
interpretation
of
that
matter
and
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
further,
that
the
only
material
before
the
court
when
considering
a
motion
were
affidavits
which
i’ve
previously
mentioned,
which
incidentally
were
in
the
krause
case
and
not
the
missouri
case
but
they’re,
in
effect,
companion
cases
and
the
court
also
took
judicial
notice
of
the
facts
as
they
existed
at
kent
state
on
this
tragic
day.
and
i’m
sure
this
court
is
well
aware
of
judge
o’connor’s
concurring
opinion
in
that
regard
in
the
sixth
circuit.
going
on
now
to
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity;
first
of
all
1983
says,
as
this
court
well
knows,
all
persons
who
violates
someone’s
rights
are
subject
to
suit,
etcetera.
and
yet,
this
court
has
held
in
pierson
versus
ray,
a
1969
decision,
that
judges
acting
within
their
scope
as
judges
are
immune
under
1983
for
acts
within
their
discretion.
in
the
tenney
case,
which
is
a
1950
case,
this
very
court
held
legislators
immune
while
doing
things
within
their
discretion.
now,
it
seems
to
me
in
congress,
that
the
people
that
passed
the
laws
and
the
people
that
interpret
the
laws
have
immunity.
when
the
very
person
designated
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitutions
of
the
respective
states
would
not
have
immunity
to
carryout
the
very
laws
that
the
legislature
imposes
and
the
judiciary
interprets.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
petitioners
are
in
error
when
they
state
that
executive
immunity
was
unknown
prior
to
1871
enactment
of
1983,
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
two
cases,
both
preceding
1983:
general
versus
stokes
and
wilks
versus
demson,
an
1845
case
and
an
1849
case.
so,
executive
immunity
did,
in
fact,
exist.
and
another
point
i
think
worthy
of
comment;
our
laws
as
traditionally
were
adopted
in
this
country
were
a
carryover,
of
course,
from
the
common
law
of
england
which
has
known
immunity
for
some
period
of
time.
do
we
have
executive
immunity
now?
in
our
judgment,
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
barr
versus
matteo
which
it,
once
again,
quotes
gregoire
versus
biddle
and
as
i’ve
previously
stated,
moyer
versus
peabody,
holmes
--
the
court
there
held
that,
certainly,
the
discretionary
act
of
the
governor
in
calling
out
the
guard
was
within
his
power
and
right.
now,
we
go
on
to
the
diversity
matters
in
applying
the
wrongful
death
diversity
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
probably
not
if
they
could
prove
all
of
the
things
which
your
honor
has
in
fact
stated.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
not
the
allegations,
your
honor.
a
court
is
bound
to
determine
the
facts
in
the
first
instance
as
it
really
exists,
as
they
truly
exist
and
the
court
may
do
whatever
it
wants
in
that
regard.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
not
normally,
your
honor,
unless
there
were
some
evidence
before
the
court,
concrete
evidence
other
than
sheer
allegations
and
sheer
conclusions
of
law
and
unwarranted
deductions
of
fact,
not
unless
there
was
something.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
if
in
fact
that
was
true,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
but
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
would
say
that
standing
alone
is
insufficient,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
depending
on
the
facts
as
they
really
existed,
if
i
were
the
federal
court
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
because
some
well
pleaded
facts,
i
think,
the
court
should
take
in.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
on
that
mere
allegation,
i
would
dismiss
the
complaint
with
nothing
further
before
me,
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
if
there
is
more
than
the
sheer
allegation
standing
alone,
your
honor,
this
is
the
distinction
i’m
attempting
to
make.
the
court
may
call
a
preliminary
hearing
and
look
into
the
facts.
now,
i’m
saying
it
would
be
a
rare
instance
when
they
do
that.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no.
well,
for
example,
let’s
take
a
gross
situation
where,
let’s
say,
two
highway
patrolmen
stop
a
drunk
driver,
summarily
trying
and
shooting.
certainly,
i’m
not
claiming
in
that
situation
that
you
would
have
immunity.
i’m
not.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i’m
saying
the
court
below
properly
looked
into
the
facts
as
they
existed,
that
is
what
i’m
saying,
your
honor,
yes
and,
i
would
point
out
that
the
petitions
did
not
even
ask
for
preliminary
hearing.
the
only
evidence
before
the
court
were
the
facts
that
we
have
before
plus
the
judicial
notice
of
the
facts
as
they
took
the
petition.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
would
not,
your
honor.
i
would
not
say
that.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
are
you
talking
about
a
criminal
prosecution
now?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
would
say
they
would
not
be
immune
for
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
to
a
criminal
situation?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
in
a
civil
suit?
just
because
it
was
a
criminal
act?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
that’s
right,
your
honor.
that’s
the
position
i
take.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
believe
they
were.
i
am
not
positive.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
pragmatic
public
policy
considerations
have
public
officials
carry
out
their
duties
unfettered
for
fear
of
a
bunch
of
lawsuits.
now,
criminal
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
there
are
two
different
statutes
you’re
talking
about,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
to
assess
in
the
same
statutes
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
your
honor,
of
course
we
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir,
that
is
exactly
what
i’m
saying.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
sir,
and
neither
the
judicial
immunity
in
the
debate,
your
honor,
or
legislative
immunity.
this
is
court
interpretation.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i’m
asking
that
this
court
is
going
to
interpret
it
and
it
has
in
the
past,
your
honor,
absolutely
and
they
have
abided
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
--
in
certain
situations.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
we’re
talking
about
damages
in
this
action,
your
honor,
and
i
am
saying
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
am
saying
exactly
that.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
loud
and
clear,
not
based
upon
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.[laughter]
--
not
based
upon
unwarranted
conclusions
of
law
and
unwarranted
deductions
of
fact,
i
am
saying
that.
briefly,
your
honor,
my
time
is
running
out,
on
the
diversity
issue,
there,
we
clearly
apply
the
law
of
the
form
of
erie
versus
tompkins,
and
there
is
a
long
line
of
ohio
cases
cited
in
our
brief
dealing
with
both
the
question
of
executive
immunity
--
with
the
question
of
executive
immunity
and
with
officials
of
state
government
in
doing
their
discretionary
acts.
moving
on
briefly
to
the
issue
of
justiciability,
whether
or
not
the
training
and
weaponry
of
the
ohio
national
guard
is
a
justiciable
matter
which
this
court
should
consider,
this
court
set
forth
the
guidelines
in
baker
versus
carr’s
six
elements.
this
case,
we
feel,
clearly
falls
into
those.
this
court
recently
heard
the
case
of
gilligan
versus
morgan
involving
the
very
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
was
a
justiciable
question
or
a
political
question.
they
decided
that
it
was
not,
that
the
judiciary
should
not
get
involved
in
these
matters,
and
we
feel
that
was
a
proper
decision.
i
see
no
distinction
to
be
made
between
an
injunction,
which
was
the
gilligan
case,
and
an
ex
post
facto
damage
action
which
is
what
we
have
here.
finally,
your
honors,
if
the
political
question
is
overruled,
the
federal
government
who
sets
up
the
standards
for
training
the
national
guard
and
who
--
and
congress
who
is
given
the
responsibility
under
the
constitution,
the
federal
government
certainly
would
be
an
indispensible
party
in
that
regard.
in
conclusion,
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
court
below
considering
rule
12
(b)
(1),
rule
12
(b)
(6),
properly
applying
those
rules
to
the
issues
of
jurisdiction
and
executive
immunity
properly
dismissed
the
petitioners’
complaints.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
sir,
in
response
to
that,
i
would
say
this
court
has
applied
1983
to
two
classic
cases:
burnbam
case
and
ex
parte
virginia,
both
involving
civil
rights
violations;
one
involving
a
jewish
gentleman
and
the
other
one
involving
a
judge
who
refused
to
let
black
people
sit
on
his
jury.
clearly,
those
are
classic
situations
for
the
application
of
1983,
but
extending
it
to
abolish
executive
immunity,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
proper.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
this
was
the
governor
of
colorado
calling
out
the
national
guard,
that
was
before
the
civil
rights
--
no,
it
wasn’t,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
that
was
after
--
it
was
1980.
that
was
the
governor
of
colorado
calling
out
the
national
guard,
and
this
man
was
imprisoned
for
two-and-a
half
months
and
he
sued
for
false
imprisonment.
and,
the
court
said
--
the
court
could
not
question
the
governor
calling
out
the
national
guard.
and,
that’s
where
holmes
said
no
one
would
doubt
that
a
guard
would
have
the
right
to
fire
into
a
mob
at
a
time
of
insurrection.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
it
should
be
distinguished,
your
honor,
that
was
an
injunction
action,
clearly
distinguishable.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
right,
and
are
also
involved
an
unconstitutional
statute.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
it
depends
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
if
you’re
talking
about
an
unconstitutional
statute,
these
cases,
the
whole
of
the
immunity
does
not
exist.
you’re
either
talking
about
an
unconstitutional
statute
or
the
officer
acting
outside
the
statutory
warrant.
now,
those
are
two
instances
in
all
of
the
cases
attempted
to
be
distinguished
by
eminent
opposition
here.
we
don’t
have
that
in
this
case,
and
it
is
unchallenged
that
there
was
authorized
statute
and
we
were
acting
with
that.
that’s
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
it
depends
on
what
the
injunction
relief
seeks,
your
honor.
i
could
not
make
the
complete
bold
statement
that
every
injunction
action
would
be
defeated.
now,
it
would
not
be
defeated.
it
would’ve
been
obviously
up
on
what
was
attempted
to
be
enjoined.
but,
every
case
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners,
your
honor,
we
feel
is
readily
distinguished.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
he
was
ignoring
the
federal
court,
your
honor,
pure
and
simple.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
in
what
regard,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
as
here?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
the
holding
in
barr
--
i’m
not
really
sure
i
follow,
your
honor,
an
injunction
action
as
to
prohibit
what?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
it
would
enjoin
him,
in
my
opinion,
if
he
were
attempting
to
enforce
an
unconstitutional
statute
or
acting
in
an
area
of
ultra
virus,
yes.
i’m
outside
the
statutory
warrant.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
because
we’re
talking
about
different
things.
you’re
talking
about,
in
one
instance,
unconstitutional
statutes
and
people
acting
clearly
outside
the
authority.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
we
are
talking
about
executive
immunity,
whether
it
exists
as
to
damages
or
injunction,
your
honor.
and
i’m
saying
that
if
the
elected
public
officials
of
this
country
cannot
constitutionally
carryout
their
duties
under
their
proper
statutory
warrants,
there
will
be
a
flood
of
lawsuits.
now,
if
they’re
acting
outside
of
either
of
those
two
and
if
they
do
something
wrong,
clearly
they
are
subject
to
lawsuit
--
an
injunction.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
many
of
them,
most
of
them.
the
best
majority
are
appointed,
but
they
still
fall
within
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
such
as
they
go
to
very
heart
of
federalism.
they
go
to
the
very
delicate
balance
between
our
form
of
government,
and
the
issue
is
can
federal
courts
control
the
administration
of
state
law?
i
respectfully
disagree
with
mr.
governor
as
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
in
our
judgment,
that
is
a
very
important
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
below,
that
is
the
district
court,
at
the
time
we
filed
our
motion
to
dismiss
under
the
eleventh
amendment
and
as
this
court
well
knows,
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
not
only
to
suits
by
the
citizens
of
one
state
against
another
state,
but
the
citizens
of
a
state
against
its
own
state
which
is
the
case
here
at
bar.
at
the
time
we
filed
our
motion
to
dismiss,
there
was
pending
before
the
district
judge
an
affidavit
of
general
del
corso
that
he
was
not
at
the
scene,
an
affidavit
from
general
canterbury
that
he
gave
no
order
for
anyone
to
fire,
and
there
was
the
executive
proclamation
of
governor
rhodes
that
a
riotous
condition,
insurrection,
if
you
will,
existed
in
the
city
in
county
--
city
of
state
and
the
kent
state
university
area.
pursuant
to
that,
the
national
guard
was
called
out.
now
at
this
point,
under
ohio
statutes,
the
members
of
the
ohio
national
guard
had
no
choice.
they,
of
course,
had
to
go.
they
were
ordered
to
go.
it
is
important
to
note,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that,
before
this
court
today,
we
do
not
have
the
issue
of
the
ohio
national
guard.
there
are
seven
named
defendants,
and
those
are
the
only
people
before
the
court
today
and
not
the
entire
ohio
national
guard.
now
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
12
(b)
(1)
motion
to
dismiss
which
goes
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
and
of
course
as
this
court
well
knows
the
12
(b)
(6)
motion
goes
with
the
question
of
whether
a
cause
of
action
is
stated.
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
suit
is
in
fact
against
the
state,
you
look
behind
the
nominal
parties
defendant
named
and
look
at
what
is
the
essential
nature
and
effect
of
the
lawsuit.
now,
this
test
was
first
set
out
by
the
--
was
set
out
by
this
court
in
the
ford
case.
dugan
versus
rank,
which
is
a
1963
decision
from
this
court,
defines
when
a
state
is
affected.
and
if
a
state
is
in
fact
affected,
then
you
look
behind
the
nominal
parties
defendant
and
determine
that
it
is
a
state
against
the
--
a
suit
against
the
sub.
and
in
dugan
versus
rank
this
court
stated,
if
the
judgment
sought
would
expend
itself
on
the
public
treasury
or
domain
or
interfere
with
the
public
administration
or
in
the
--
if
the
effect
of
the
judgment
would
be
to
restrain
the
government
from
acting
or
to
compel
it
to
act,
then
the
act
is
considered
as
to
be
one
against
the
state.
now,
we
submit
here
that
the
seven
named
defendants
are
nominal
parties
only
and
that
this
action
is
in
fact
one
against
the
state
of
ohio.
now,
the
case
of
barr
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
the
sterling
case
is
distinguishable.
that
is
an
injunction
action,
your
honor,
to
enforce
an
unconstitutional
statute.
now,
we
don’t
have
that
situation
here.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you.
i
don’t
believe
the
court
said
that.
i
think
what
the
court
said,
because
you
have
an
unconstitutional
statute,
you
don’t
have
the
state
acting,
therefore,
it
isn’t
the
state
acting.
the
state
cannot
enforce
an
unconstitutional
statute.
now,
as
i
read
the
decision,
i
think
that’
what
you
said.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
if
we
were
acting
under
unconstitutional
statute,
your
honor.
there
is
a
difference,
if
i
may
say,
between
stating
a
cause
of
action
and
jurisdiction.
i’m
not
too
stating
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
definite
distinction
in
my
opinion.
and,
i’m
saying
here
that
if
the
seven
named
defendants
were
acting
under
a
constitutional
warrant
at
the
time
and
there
is
no
allegation
or
challenge
to
the
contrary
by
the
petitioners
and
if
they
were
acting
within
the
delegation
of
that
statutory
warrant,
then
they
are
agents
of
the
sovereign
and
the
action
may
not
be
maintained.
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
and
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
your
honor,
i
would
get
to
the
cause
of
action
discussion
later
as
it
relates
to
the
doctrine
of
executive
immunity.
but
this
court
in
barr,
in
quoting
from
gregoire,
adopted
his
--
judge
hand’s
reasoning
and
logic
to
the
effect
that
if
actions
are
permitted
to
be
maintained
against
state
officials,
then
you
will
have
times
when
a
state
official
will
abuse
his
power.
there
will
go
un-redressed
some
wrongs,
but
you
must
weigh
the
equities
which
is
more
important.
this
is
a
pragmatic,
a
public
policy
argument,
if
you
will.
and
for
example,
to
illustrate
that
point,
as
mr.
chief
justice
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
in
moyer
versus
martin
we
have
the
question
of
calling
out
the
national
guard.
justice
holmes
wrote
the
decision
in
that
case.
this
court
held
that
the
calling
out
of
the
national
guard
was
not
reviewable
and
justice
holmes
stated
“as
no
one
would
deny
that
there
was
immunity
for
ordering
a
company
fire
on
a
mob
in
insurrection
and
that
a
state
law
authorizing
the
governor
to
deprive
citizens
of
life
under
such
circumstances
was
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
same
is
true
of
a
law
authorizing
by
implication
what
was
done
in
this
case.”
and
in
that
particular
case,
perhaps
a
man
was
unconstitutionally
deprived
of
his
liberty.
he
was
put
in
jail
for,
i
think,
two-and-a
half
months,
but
this
court
held
that
the
discretion
of
the
executive
branch
of
a
state
government
in
calling
out
the
national
guard
is
his
discretion.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
that
was
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
alright.
now,
the
petitioners
on
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
rely
on
sterling,
ex
parte
young,
those
kinds
of
cases,
all
of
which
are
distinguishable
in
our
opinion
because
we’re
talking
about
unconstitutional
statutes.
and
in
sterling,
before
the
governor
called
out
the
guard,
the
federal
court
had
already
enjoined
the
matter.
so,
he
was
flying
right
in
the
face
of
an
order
of
a
federal
court
at
that
time.
the
larson
case
applied
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
agents
of
the
sovereign
were
immune
even
if
their
actions
at
the
time
were
ultra
virus.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
going
further
on
my
jurisdictional
argument
as
to
whether
the
court
below
under
rule
12
(b)
(1)
had
jurisdiction,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that,
contrary
to
what
my
imminent
opponent
stated.
sterling
versus
constantin
did
not
in
fact
overruled
moyer,
it
cited
it
with
approval
and
stated
they
were
dealing
with
a
different
situation
there,
taking
of
property.
moving
on
now
to
the
effect
test,
that
is
if
the
nature
of
the
lawsuit
even
though
naming
nominal
parties
as
defendant
in
fact
affects
state
government,
then
it
is
an
action
against
the
state.
and
this
court
in
dugan
versus
rank,
which
is
a
1963
decision,
stated
the
test.
the
general
rule
is
that
if
suit
is
against
the
sovereign,
if
the
judgment
sought
would
expend
itself
on
the
public
treasury,
domain,
or
interfere
with
the
administration
of
justice,
if
the
effect
of
the
judgment
would
be
to
restrain
government
from
acting
or
to
compel
it
to
act.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
we’re
talking
about
here.
granted,
the
dugan
case
is
a
federal
government
case.
but
which
is
more
important,
the
constitutionally
granted
rights
to
the
states,
that
is,
the
eleventh
amendment,
or
the
common
law
interpretation
of
the
immunity
of
a
federal
government?
along
that
same
line,
as
this
court
well
knows
in
barr
versus
matteo,
they
quoted,
with
approval,
judge
learned
hand
in
gregoire
versus
biddle
and
i’d
like
to
quote
a
part
of
judge
hand’s
opinion.
“again
and
again,
the
public
interest
calls
for
action
which
may
turn
out
to
be
found
on
a
mistake,
in
the
face
of
which,
an
official
may
later
find
himself
hard
put
to
satisfy
a
jury
of
his
good
faith,
the
answer
must
be
found
in
a
balance
between
the
evils
inevitable
in
either
alternative.”
in
this
instance,
it
has
been
thought
in
the
end
better
to
leave
un-redressed
the
wrongs
done
by
dishonest
officers
than
to
subject
those
who
try
to
do
their
duty
to
the
constant
dread
of
retaliation.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
exactly
a
situation
with
which
we
are
here
confronted.
what
would
be
the
effect
on
state
officials
in
every
state
of
the
union
if
federal
court
would
be
granted
jurisdiction
in
this
kind
of
a
situation?
any
vituperative,
vindictive,
plaintiff
wanting
to
vent
his
spleen
on
a
state
official
could
file
a
lawsuit.
you
could
literally
tie
up
state
governments,
just
mimeograph
thousands
of
lawsuits
against
all
kinds
of
people
and
tie
up
state
government.
that
is
exactly
how
it
could
be
affected.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not,
but
the
same
reasoning
would
apply,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.
that
is
true,
yes
sir.
let’s
just
take
a
specific
example
of
a
national
guardsman
in
any
state
in
the
union
called
to
act
of
duty,
to
quell
riot,
insurrection,
what
have
you?
if
he
knew
that
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
as
he
was
commanded
to
do
by
the
governor
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
his
commanding
officers
that
he
could
be
sued,
would
he
diligently
carry
out
his
duties?
this
is
a
very
pragmatic
policy
consideration.
should
officials,
all
state
officials,
be
free
to
carryout
their
duties
unhindered
and
unhampered
or
should
they
live
in
constant
fear
of
being
sued?
we
feel,
as
did
judge
hand,
that
they
must
be
free
to
carryout
their
duties.
now
clearly,
does
that
leave
people
without
a
remedy?
if
you
have
a
dishonest
official
or
somebody
acting
vindictively?
it
does
not
because
they
are
still
subject
to
the
electoral
process
and
they
can
be
recalled
from
office.
in
conclusion,
therefore,
on
the
12
(b)
(1)
motion
on
jurisdiction,
we
clearly
feel
the
courts
below
were
correct
in
their
interpretation
of
that
matter
and
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
further,
that
the
only
material
before
the
court
when
considering
a
motion
were
affidavits
which
i’ve
previously
mentioned,
which
incidentally
were
in
the
krause
case
and
not
the
missouri
case
but
they’re,
in
effect,
companion
cases
and
the
court
also
took
judicial
notice
of
the
facts
as
they
existed
at
kent
state
on
this
tragic
day.
and
i’m
sure
this
court
is
well
aware
of
judge
o’connor’s
concurring
opinion
in
that
regard
in
the
sixth
circuit.
going
on
now
to
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity;
first
of
all
1983
says,
as
this
court
well
knows,
all
persons
who
violates
someone’s
rights
are
subject
to
suit,
etcetera.
and
yet,
this
court
has
held
in
pierson
versus
ray,
a
1969
decision,
that
judges
acting
within
their
scope
as
judges
are
immune
under
1983
for
acts
within
their
discretion.
in
the
tenney
case,
which
is
a
1950
case,
this
very
court
held
legislators
immune
while
doing
things
within
their
discretion.
now,
it
seems
to
me
in
congress,
that
the
people
that
passed
the
laws
and
the
people
that
interpret
the
laws
have
immunity.
when
the
very
person
designated
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitutions
of
the
respective
states
would
not
have
immunity
to
carryout
the
very
laws
that
the
legislature
imposes
and
the
judiciary
interprets.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
petitioners
are
in
error
when
they
state
that
executive
immunity
was
unknown
prior
to
1871
enactment
of
1983,
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
two
cases,
both
preceding
1983:
general
versus
stokes
and
wilks
versus
demson,
an
1845
case
and
an
1849
case.
so,
executive
immunity
did,
in
fact,
exist.
and
another
point
i
think
worthy
of
comment;
our
laws
as
traditionally
were
adopted
in
this
country
were
a
carryover,
of
course,
from
the
common
law
of
england
which
has
known
immunity
for
some
period
of
time.
do
we
have
executive
immunity
now?
in
our
judgment,
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
barr
versus
matteo
which
it,
once
again,
quotes
gregoire
versus
biddle
and
as
i’ve
previously
stated,
moyer
versus
peabody,
holmes
--
the
court
there
held
that,
certainly,
the
discretionary
act
of
the
governor
in
calling
out
the
guard
was
within
his
power
and
right.
now,
we
go
on
to
the
diversity
matters
in
applying
the
wrongful
death
diversity
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
probably
not
if
they
could
prove
all
of
the
things
which
your
honor
has
in
fact
stated.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
not
the
allegations,
your
honor.
a
court
is
bound
to
determine
the
facts
in
the
first
instance
as
it
really
exists,
as
they
truly
exist
and
the
court
may
do
whatever
it
wants
in
that
regard.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
not
normally,
your
honor,
unless
there
were
some
evidence
before
the
court,
concrete
evidence
other
than
sheer
allegations
and
sheer
conclusions
of
law
and
unwarranted
deductions
of
fact,
not
unless
there
was
something.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
if
in
fact
that
was
true,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
but
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
would
say
that
standing
alone
is
insufficient,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
depending
on
the
facts
as
they
really
existed,
if
i
were
the
federal
court
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
because
some
well
pleaded
facts,
i
think,
the
court
should
take
in.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
on
that
mere
allegation,
i
would
dismiss
the
complaint
with
nothing
further
before
me,
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
if
there
is
more
than
the
sheer
allegation
standing
alone,
your
honor,
this
is
the
distinction
i’m
attempting
to
make.
the
court
may
call
a
preliminary
hearing
and
look
into
the
facts.
now,
i’m
saying
it
would
be
a
rare
instance
when
they
do
that.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no.
well,
for
example,
let’s
take
a
gross
situation
where,
let’s
say,
two
highway
patrolmen
stop
a
drunk
driver,
summarily
trying
and
shooting.
certainly,
i’m
not
claiming
in
that
situation
that
you
would
have
immunity.
i’m
not.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i’m
saying
the
court
below
properly
looked
into
the
facts
as
they
existed,
that
is
what
i’m
saying,
your
honor,
yes
and,
i
would
point
out
that
the
petitions
did
not
even
ask
for
preliminary
hearing.
the
only
evidence
before
the
court
were
the
facts
that
we
have
before
plus
the
judicial
notice
of
the
facts
as
they
took
the
petition.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
would
not,
your
honor.
i
would
not
say
that.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
are
you
talking
about
a
criminal
prosecution
now?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
would
say
they
would
not
be
immune
for
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
to
a
criminal
situation?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
in
a
civil
suit?
just
because
it
was
a
criminal
act?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
that’s
right,
your
honor.
that’s
the
position
i
take.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
believe
they
were.
i
am
not
positive.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
pragmatic
public
policy
considerations
have
public
officials
carry
out
their
duties
unfettered
for
fear
of
a
bunch
of
lawsuits.
now,
criminal
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
there
are
two
different
statutes
you’re
talking
about,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
to
assess
in
the
same
statutes
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
your
honor,
of
course
we
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir,
that
is
exactly
what
i’m
saying.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
sir,
and
neither
the
judicial
immunity
in
the
debate,
your
honor,
or
legislative
immunity.
this
is
court
interpretation.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i’m
asking
that
this
court
is
going
to
interpret
it
and
it
has
in
the
past,
your
honor,
absolutely
and
they
have
abided
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
--
in
certain
situations.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
we’re
talking
about
damages
in
this
action,
your
honor,
and
i
am
saying
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
i
am
saying
exactly
that.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
loud
and
clear,
not
based
upon
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.[laughter]
--
not
based
upon
unwarranted
conclusions
of
law
and
unwarranted
deductions
of
fact,
i
am
saying
that.
briefly,
your
honor,
my
time
is
running
out,
on
the
diversity
issue,
there,
we
clearly
apply
the
law
of
the
form
of
erie
versus
tompkins,
and
there
is
a
long
line
of
ohio
cases
cited
in
our
brief
dealing
with
both
the
question
of
executive
immunity
--
with
the
question
of
executive
immunity
and
with
officials
of
state
government
in
doing
their
discretionary
acts.
moving
on
briefly
to
the
issue
of
justiciability,
whether
or
not
the
training
and
weaponry
of
the
ohio
national
guard
is
a
justiciable
matter
which
this
court
should
consider,
this
court
set
forth
the
guidelines
in
baker
versus
carr’s
six
elements.
this
case,
we
feel,
clearly
falls
into
those.
this
court
recently
heard
the
case
of
gilligan
versus
morgan
involving
the
very
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
was
a
justiciable
question
or
a
political
question.
they
decided
that
it
was
not,
that
the
judiciary
should
not
get
involved
in
these
matters,
and
we
feel
that
was
a
proper
decision.
i
see
no
distinction
to
be
made
between
an
injunction,
which
was
the
gilligan
case,
and
an
ex
post
facto
damage
action
which
is
what
we
have
here.
finally,
your
honors,
if
the
political
question
is
overruled,
the
federal
government
who
sets
up
the
standards
for
training
the
national
guard
and
who
--
and
congress
who
is
given
the
responsibility
under
the
constitution,
the
federal
government
certainly
would
be
an
indispensible
party
in
that
regard.
in
conclusion,
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
court
below
considering
rule
12
(b)
(1),
rule
12
(b)
(6),
properly
applying
those
rules
to
the
issues
of
jurisdiction
and
executive
immunity
properly
dismissed
the
petitioners’
complaints.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
sir,
in
response
to
that,
i
would
say
this
court
has
applied
1983
to
two
classic
cases:
burnbam
case
and
ex
parte
virginia,
both
involving
civil
rights
violations;
one
involving
a
jewish
gentleman
and
the
other
one
involving
a
judge
who
refused
to
let
black
people
sit
on
his
jury.
clearly,
those
are
classic
situations
for
the
application
of
1983,
but
extending
it
to
abolish
executive
immunity,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
proper.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
this
was
the
governor
of
colorado
calling
out
the
national
guard,
that
was
before
the
civil
rights
--
no,
it
wasn’t,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
that
was
after
--
it
was
1980.
that
was
the
governor
of
colorado
calling
out
the
national
guard,
and
this
man
was
imprisoned
for
two-and-a
half
months
and
he
sued
for
false
imprisonment.
and,
the
court
said
--
the
court
could
not
question
the
governor
calling
out
the
national
guard.
and,
that’s
where
holmes
said
no
one
would
doubt
that
a
guard
would
have
the
right
to
fire
into
a
mob
at
a
time
of
insurrection.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
it
should
be
distinguished,
your
honor,
that
was
an
injunction
action,
clearly
distinguishable.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
right,
and
are
also
involved
an
unconstitutional
statute.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
it
depends
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
if
you’re
talking
about
an
unconstitutional
statute,
these
cases,
the
whole
of
the
immunity
does
not
exist.
you’re
either
talking
about
an
unconstitutional
statute
or
the
officer
acting
outside
the
statutory
warrant.
now,
those
are
two
instances
in
all
of
the
cases
attempted
to
be
distinguished
by
eminent
opposition
here.
we
don’t
have
that
in
this
case,
and
it
is
unchallenged
that
there
was
authorized
statute
and
we
were
acting
with
that.
that’s
--
mr.
charles
e.
brown
it
depends
on
what
the
injunction
relief
seeks,
your
honor.
i
could
not
make
the
complete
bold
statement
that
every
injunction
action
would
be
defeated.
now,
it
would
not
be
defeated.
it
would’ve
been
obviously
up
on
what
was
attempted
to
be
enjoined.
but,
every
case
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners,
your
honor,
we
feel
is
readily
distinguished.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
he
was
ignoring
the
federal
court,
your
honor,
pure
and
simple.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
in
what
regard,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
as
here?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
well,
the
holding
in
barr
--
i’m
not
really
sure
i
follow,
your
honor,
an
injunction
action
as
to
prohibit
what?
mr.
charles
e.
brown
it
would
enjoin
him,
in
my
opinion,
if
he
were
attempting
to
enforce
an
unconstitutional
statute
or
acting
in
an
area
of
ultra
virus,
yes.
i’m
outside
the
statutory
warrant.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
because
we’re
talking
about
different
things.
you’re
talking
about,
in
one
instance,
unconstitutional
statutes
and
people
acting
clearly
outside
the
authority.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
we
are
talking
about
executive
immunity,
whether
it
exists
as
to
damages
or
injunction,
your
honor.
and
i’m
saying
that
if
the
elected
public
officials
of
this
country
cannot
constitutionally
carryout
their
duties
under
their
proper
statutory
warrants,
there
will
be
a
flood
of
lawsuits.
now,
if
they’re
acting
outside
of
either
of
those
two
and
if
they
do
something
wrong,
clearly
they
are
subject
to
lawsuit
--
an
injunction.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
no,
many
of
them,
most
of
them.
the
best
majority
are
appointed,
but
they
still
fall
within
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
charles
e.
brown
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
