mr.
steven
a.
sindell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don’t
believe
that
this
case
can
be
decided
with
respect
to
the
questions
of
law
that
are
presented
without
a
reference,
at
least
some
reference
point
to
what
the
record
contains
with
regard
to
the
facts
and
i
think
something
has
to
be
said
in
that
regard.
the
complaint
filed
in
this
action
clearly
state
what
would
otherwise
be
a
cause
of
action
as
at
least,
i
can
best
understand
it.
we
have
alleged
that
four
innocent
students
were
shot
on
a
college
campus
without
any
justification.
we
have
alleged,
members
of
this
supreme
court,
we
have
alleged
that
the
governor
and
the
generals
conspired
intentionally
to
deprive
these
people
with
the
specific
intent
and
bad
faith
in
effect
of
their
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
and
under
1983.
we
have
alleged
that
these
facts
are
true
and
that
they
can
be
proven.
we
were
confronted
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
which
as
i
understand
it
and
notwithstanding
any
affidavit
that
was
ever
filed,
and
this
record
contains,
if
anything,
the
liberal
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
by
some
of
these
defendants.
we
have
alleged,
in
these
cases,
that
there
was
no
justification
for
it
and
nevertheless,
and
not
withstanding
that
and
based
upon
what
we
felt
in
effect
were
news
media
accounts
of
this
incident
that
the
passions
of
the
headlines
were
substituted
for
the
rules
of
evidence
in
this
case.
and
i
quote
specifically,
where
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
lower
court
said
that
“the
pleadings
clearly
contrive
to
hide
rather
than
disclose
the
true
background
of
the
events”
and
the
predicated
causes
of
action
without
disclosing
their
true
subject
matter,
without
any
evidence
before
that
court
to
so
find,
that
is
exactly
what
was
said.
the
majority
opinion
in
the
lower
court
is
infected
with
statement
after
statement
that
there
was
a
riot,
that
there
was
an
insurrection,
that
there
was
a
rebellion
and
members
of
this
court,
even
the
governor
of
the
state
of
ohio
the
after
it
occurred
never
used
a
word
like
that,
in
his
proclamations
to
justify
it,
not
one
word
to
that
effect,
nevertheless,
the
court
has
so
found.
now,
i’m
not
suggesting
anything
except
that
there
is
a
colorable
claim.
what
as
juxtaposed
to
these
allegations
have
the
defendants
set?
they
have
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
at
least
nine
times
in
response
to
material
interrogatories
and
more
importantly,
if
we
are
going
to
take
judicial
notice,
let
us
then
take
judicial
notice
of
one
responsible
investigative
organ
of
this
nation
and
that
is
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
where
it
was
specifically
stated
and
i’m
quoting
at
pages
24
and
25
of
our
brief
things
like
these.
“we
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
claim
by
the
national
guard
that
their
lives
were
endangered
by
the
students
was
fabricated
subsequent
to
the
event.
one
guardsman
admitted
that
his
life
was
not
endangered
and
that
he
fired
indiscriminately
into
the
crowd.
he
further
stated
that
the
guardsman
had
gotten
together
after
the
shooting
and
decided
to
fabricate
the
story
that
they
were
in
danger
of
seriously
bodily
harm
or
death
from
the
students.
no,
the
guardsmen
were
not
surrounded.
no
guardsman
claims
he
was
hit
with
rocks
immediately
prior
to
the
firing.
there
was
no
sniper.
some
guardsman
are
known
is
yet
had
to
be
physically
restrained
from
continuing
to
fire
their
weapons,”
directly
quoted.
the
people
shot
in
this
case
were
over
a
football
field
away.
one
man
sits
here
today
in
a
wheelchair
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
and
i
say
that
if
we
are
going
to
substitute
in
the
court
of
law,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
news
media
headlines
or
whatever
predilections
of
the
facts
the
court
may
have
for
the
presentation
of
evidence
in
its
orderly
course
then
i
say
that
we
have
really
reached
the
stage
where
the
rudimentary
concepts
of
due
process
of
law
have
been
violated
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
shocking
departure
from
procedure
at
least
as
i’ve
always
understood
it
in
the
past.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
there
was
no
claim
of
insurrection.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case,
not
only
the
day
after
the
shooting
and
having
this
proclamation
did
he
use
insurrection,
rebellion,
invasion,
riot,
tumult
or
any
such
words,
but
your
honors,
in
addition
to
that,
months
later
with
the
advice
presumably
of
competent
counsel,
my
brother
here,
then
he
indeed
not
say
anything
more
than
if
there
were
threatened
disorders
and
breaches
of
the
peace
in
the
answers
to
interrogatories
that
are
part
of
the
record
of
this
court.
the
president’s
commission
on
campus
unrest
said
that
this
shooting
was
unwarranted,
inexcusable
and
unjustified.
it
is
our
view
that
the
rules
of
evidence
cannot
be
supplemented
by
the
factual
predilections
of
a
judge
reviewing
a
complaint
not
a
summary
judgment
motion,
but
a
complaint.
now,
specifically
dealing
with
the
question
of
immunity
and
i
think
it’s
important
that
we
do
that
here,
in
this
regard.
in
sterling
against
constantin,
that
supreme
court
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
a
governor,
governor
constantin
had
issued
a
proclamation
which
was
stronger
than
the
one
issued
by
governor
rhodes.
it
said
that
there
was
an
insurrection.
it
said
that
there
was
a
rebellion.
it
said
that
there
was
a
state
of
affairs
which
justified
the
calling
of
martial
law.
and
nevertheless,
the
district
court
went
on
to
find
behind
those
allegations
of
the
governor
in
his
proclamation
that
that
wasn’t
true.
and
in
fact,
no
such
thing
existed
except
what
they
characterized
as
breaches
of
the
peace
and
when
the
governor
and
the
generals
came
to
this
court
and
said,
“we
are
immune
under
the
eleventh
amendment,”
this
court
specifically
held
that
a
federal
court
has
ample
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
veracity
of
those
allegations
with
evidence
properly
presented
before
them.
and
i
think
the
case
of
moyer
against
peabody
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
one
and
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
point.
indeed,
moyer
was
a
1983
action
and
there’s
no
question
about
that.
but
what
is
important
to
recognize
about
moyer
and
again
i
must
return
to
the
facts
because
i
think
they’re
critical.
in
that
case,
the
governor
and
the
complainant
both
agreed
on
two
things.
they
agreed,
number
one,
without
dispute
that
an
insurrection
existed
and
they
agreed
that
the
governor
acted
in
good
faith.
those
were
stipulated
facts
before
that
court
and
i
quote
the
language
when
i
say
that
the
court,
the
supreme
court,
in
its
opinion
said,
“we
are
here
assuming
that
there
was
no
insurrection,
excuse
me,
that
there
was
an
insurrection
and
that
he
exercised
good
faith
and
the
only
claim
is
that
he
was
unreasonable
in
arresting
moyer
under
those
circumstances.”
now,
this
is
not
such
a
case.
there
is
no
agreement
amongst
counsel
in
this
case
that
a
state
of
insurrection
existed.
instead,
we
have
alleged
there
was
a
peaceful
gathering
on
a
college
campus
with
bullets
intervening,
the
break
up
what
otherwise
was
a
peaceful
gathering
on
a
college
campus.
now,
if
we
can't
prove
that,
then
we
should
lose.
but
if
we
can
prove
it,
it’s
not
a
moyer
case.
we
do
not
agree,
as
counsel
did
in
moyer
that
there
was
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
governor.
to
the
contrary,
it
is
our
allegation
in
this
case,
and
it
is
our
intention
to
prove
that
the
governor
was
personally
involved
in
this
situation.
that
as
commander-in-chief,
remember
this
was
a
trial
several
days
before
the
republic
senator,
senatorial
primary
and
without
editorializing
on
the
validity
of
the
law
and
order
position
that
he
was
taking
the
fact
is
that
that
was
his
position
that
he
advanced
in
that
particular
situation
and
here
was
threatened
disorder
and
he
just
wasn’t
sitting
behind
his
desk,
receiving
information
of
an
alarming
situation
and
sending
troops
out,
he
went
down
there
to
that
campus,
the
day
before
this
incident
occurred.
he
made
a
speech
in
the
presence
of
the
commanding
general
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
yes
sir.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
i
would
want
to
--
i
want
to
stop
going
away
from
this
record
for
this
reason.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
your
honor,
i
want
to
go
to
court
and
i
want
to
prove
these
things
and
the
reason
that
i
bring
these
things
into
the
case
is
to,
is
simply
because
three
of
the
reviewing
judges
in
this
case,
three
of
them,
have
gone
outside
the
record
and
refused
to
believe
that
the
allegations
were
true.
that’s
why
i
go
outside
the
record
not
to
convince
you
that
what
i
say
is
proof
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
to
convince
you
that
there
are
allegations
which
weren’t
the
right
to
present
evidence
in
a
court.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
all
you
have
to
do
is
agree
with
me
that
the
complaint’s
allegation
should
be
taken
as
true
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we’re
entitled
to
prove
them.
i
would
like
specifically,
in
regard
to
the
eleventh
amendment
intention
and
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
that
for
a
moment.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
distinction
that
has
been
made
here
between
a
statute
that
an
unconstitutional
action
under
a
statute
that
is
allegedly
unconstitutional
is
different
than
an
action
which
is
just
plain
unconstitutional
because
of
the
nature
of
the
action,
really
was
never
intended
as
a
distinction
to
be
engrafted
upon
the
civil
rights
act
at
all.
congress
intended
to
reach
the
unconstitutional
effect
if
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court.
it
says,
“every
person
who
acts
not
under
a
statute,
not
under
without
a
statute,
within
the
statute,
every
person
who
acts
under
color
of
law
to
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
another
is
libel
for
that
action.”
every
person
and
it
doesn’t
engraft
any
distinction
at
all.
the
only
reason
we’re
not
seeking
an
injunction
in
this
case
and
it
says
in
that
statute,
an
action
at
law
equity
or
other
proper
redress
the
breadth
is
broad.
we
can't
seek
an
injunction
in
this
case.
all
we
have
is
the
available
remedy
of
damages.
that’s
obvious
from
the
circumstances
and
therefore
we
are
well
within
the
terms
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
to
say
that
only
where
a
statute
exists
that’s
unconstitutional,
can
the
civil
rights
act
apply
as
to
i
think
emasculate
the
very
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
which
was
to
reach
the
state
official
himself
for
the
affect
of
what
he
did.
and
this
court
has
never
held
for
example
in
dealing
with
police
officers
in
monroe
against
pape
or
egan
against
the
city
of
aurora,
in
any
of
those
cases
that
because
they
were
acting
under
color
of
a
valid
statute,
that
therefore
for
some
reason,
they
were
immune.
that
would
be
inconsistent,
i
think
with
the
entire
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act.
they
were
conducting
actions
not
under
a
statute,
but
on
their
own
which
were
unconstitutional,
which
violated
the
rights
of
those
individuals,
and
therefore,
they
were
held
inappropriately
so
by
this
court
to
be
within
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
civil
rights
act.
it
seems
to
me
that
cases
like
ex
parte
young,
sterling
against
constantin,
griffin
against
the
board
of
prince
edward
county,
all
the
way
ranging
from
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
right
up
until
the
present
time
have
all
held
that
where
an
injunction
is
the
appropriate
form
of
redress,
the
civil
rights
act
makes
no
distinction
between
damages
and
injunction.
that
issue
has
been
raised
here
and
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
difference
because
the
sterling
specifically
holds
that
an
injunction
is
a
more
extraordinary
remedy
and
damages
is
a
less
extraordinary
remedy
and
other
cases
if
so
held
as
well
of
this
court
and
i
don’t
see
the
difference.
it
depends
on
the
remedy
that’s
needed.
it
would
seem
on
the
damage
that
has
been
done
and
not
upon
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought.
congress
never
intended,
as
i
read
the
legislative
history,
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
to
make
a
distinction
between
damages
and
injunctive
relief
as
to
whether
or
not
there’s
immunity.
i
never
read
that
in
any
of
the
decisions
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
supportable
by
any
of
the
rules
of
law
that
have
been
promulgated
by
this
court
and
i’m
thinking
of
cases
like
mitchum
against
foster,
monroe
against
pape,
zwickler
against
koota
and
particularly
those
various
circuits
like
mclaughlin
against
tilendis,
jenkins
against
averett
was
a
damage
action,
many
cases
under
the
civil
rights
act
about
damages
where
damage
is
the
appropriate
remedy.
and
what
i
think
is
critical
here
is
that
we
did
bring
a
case
against
the
state
of
ohio.
we
sued
the
state
in
its
own
courts.
we
brought
that
case
and
we
contended
that
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
was
unconstitutional
in
violation
not
only
of
the
ohio
constitution,
but
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
mr.
justice
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
white
in
this
regard
and
i
don’t
mean
to
not
answer
your
question,
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
we
couldn’t
have
alleged
anything
stronger,
but
taking
it
a
step
down,
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
negligence
in
the
tort
sense
may
not
be
appropriate
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
well,
that’s
the
tort
standard
as
i
understand
it,
reasonable
conduct
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
well,
i
think
that
it’s
critical
too
as
you
point
out.
i
think
it’s
critical
to
an
interpretation
of
the
civil
rights
act
to
ask
what
the
state
of
mind
of
the
person
you’re
suing
is,
in
addition
to
what
the
result
was.
a
mere
accident
can
cause
a
terrible
tragedy
and
yet
not
create
liability.
it
is
my
suggestion
to
this
court
that
the
appropriate
standard
that
occurs
to
me
for
a
police
type
situation
is
in
jenkins
against
averett.
a
case
before
the
fourth
circuit,
i
believe,
where
it
was
held
that
in
that
particular
case,
an
act
of
wanton
misconduct,
a
very
high
degree
of
reckless
was
sufficient
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
at
least
a
high
degree
of
recklessness.
yes.
i
would
say
that
would
be
the
appropriate
standard
but
i
would
not
suggest
to
you
that
a
lower
standard
is
not
possible.
i’m
simply
saying
that
as
the
state
of
this
case
is
now,
i
don’t
see
how
we
could
have
alleged
anything
stronger
and
that’s
really
what
i’m
suggesting
in
this
particular
situation.
i
would
emphasize
that
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
amendment
claim,
your
honors,
that
this
case
is
not
a
case
against
the
state.
the
state
is
not
a
party
to
this
action.
no
money
is
being
sought
from
the
state
treasury
at
all.
no
judgment
rendered
in
this
case
will
require
a
state
official
to
take
any
action
or
prohibit
a
state
official
from
taking
any
action.
this
is
not
an
action
even
against
state
officials.
the
present
defendants
in
this
case
aren’t
even
officials
from
the
state
of
ohio
at
all
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
entire
body
of
eleventh
amendment
law
as
i
read
it
suggests
that
in
such
a
case
where
the
individual
act
is
allegedly
unconstitutional
that
that
is
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
and
i
think
sterling
specifically
so
holds.
what
is
being
attempted
and
i
think
this
is
the
critical
distinction
here
and
if
i
understand
the
defendant’s
argument
is
that
we
shouldn’t
just
consider
these
things,
but
we
should
ask
ourselves
what
will
be
the
effect
on
the
governor
in
the
future.
how
fearful
will
the
governor
be,
the
chief
executive
be
or
other
executives
below
him
and
i
might
add
it
goes
all
the
way
down
to
the
trigger
man
in
this
particular
case
and
the
court
held
that
everyone
to
be
immune
not
just
the
governor,
but
let’s
ask
that
question.
what
will
be
the
effect
that
the
state
government
will
not
be
able
to
operate
that
people
will
be
fearful
that
they
will
have
come
in
and
defend
lawsuits
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
if
i
understand
that
argument
correctly?
and
i
would
have
this
to
answer
to
it.
i
would
say
that
that
argument
can
be
made
in
every
single
case
under
1983.
there
is
no
case
where
it
cannot
be
argued
that
the
effect
of
suing
an
individual
for
damages
for
violating
constitutional
rights
be
the
governor
or
anyone
else
would
not
have
some
effect
on
their
future
conduct,
would
not
give
them
some
“pause
for
concern,”
would
not
inconvenience
them
in
some
way,
but
it
is
my
suggestion
that
the
act
was
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind.
that
was
the
very
effect
that
was
intended.
congress
passed
the
civil
rights
act
in
part
to
deter
this
very
kind
of
thing
and
if
we
are
to
give
meaning
to
that
enactment,
i
think
we
to
recognize
that
the
purpose
and
intent
of
that
particular
enactment
was
to
effectuate
the
deterrence
that
any
tort
remedy
has
and
this
a
congressionally
sanctioned
tort.
as
i
understand
section
1983,
it
is
both
a
compensatory
tort
action
as
well
as
having
a
deterrent
effect
and
the
deterred
effect
that
is
complained
of
here
is
the
very
purpose
of
enactment
in
the
first
place
and
so
to
say,
that
because
it
has
an
effect,
that
should
be
the
reason
to
bar
suits.
for
that
reason
alone,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
run
completely
contrary
to
the
whole
intent.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
should
hold
and
we’ve
sued
the
state
of
ohio
which
has
immunized
itself
in
the
state
courts,
if
this
court
holds
that
this
too
is
an
action
against
the
state,
then
we
are
really
left
without
a
remedy.
we
have
no
place
to
go.
then
this
court
has
permanently
and
forever
foreclosed
any
right
to
appear
in
a
court
of
law
anywhere
against
anyone
to
test
the
allegations
in
these
complaints
and
to
establish
any
form
of
redress.
this
court
will
--
“this
is
it!
this
is
our
last
opportunity
to
have
redress.
there
will
be
none.
we
can't
sue
the
state
in
its
own
courts
and
we
can't
if
this
court
should
hold
we
can't
sue
here
and
we’re
without
redress.”
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
the
question
of
immunity
as
it
applies
to
legislators
and
judges
and
that
has
been
raised
and
i
am
cognizant
of
pierson
against
ray
and
tenney
against
brandhove,
and
i
think
this
is
very
important.
first
of
all,
let
me
say
that
i
have
some
empathy
with
the
dissenting
opinions
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
those
cases
that
a
dishonest
legislature
if
it
so
alleged
and
a
dishonest
judge
should
be
subject
to
suit,
but
we
have
those
decisions
and
they
stand
as
they
do
now
and
i
suggest
this.
that
after
all
a
legislative
process
and
a
legislator
is
involved
in
a
deliberative
thing,
the
result
of
what
he
does
is
open
to
the
public.
he
has
the
opportunity,
first
he
must
concur
with
other
people.
if
his
enactment
is
going
to
be
harmful,
a
court
can
review
it.
all
of
this
process
can
take
place
and
there
is
full
opportunity
for
the
public
in
the
democratic
process
to
participate
and
so
perhaps
we
can
say
as
does
our
constitution
that
a
legislature
shall
not
be
examined
in
any
other
place
and
with
the
judge,
the
same
is
true.
it
is
an
open
process,
presumably,
a
deliberative
one.before
any
finality
takes
place,
a
court
can
review
that
action,
but
such
is
not
the
case
with
an
executive.
in
the
case
of
an
executive,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
actions
maybe
or
may
not
be
taken
with
deliberation,
but
not
necessarily
with
public
participation
at
that
time.
the
governor,
in
theory,
in
his
own
chambers
and
secretly
without
making
it
public,
open
up
and
decide
to
wheel
the
weapons
of
death
without
any
such
legislative
or
judicial
process
as
a
result
which
the
instant
action
of
a
bullet
terminates
a
youngster
or
man
or
anyone’s
life.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
executive
immunity
is
applied
in
that
situation
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
what
occurs
with
the
legislator
and
with
the
judge.
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
suggest
to
you
that
to
say
that
they
are
all
in
the
same
kind
is
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act
itself.
to
say
that
a
governor
cannot
even
be
or
a
general
or
a
guardsman
cannot
be
even
subject
to
inquiry
and
we
--
only
has
that
he
acts
honestly
in
this
case,
we
say
he
can
make
a
mistake,
that’s
okay.
is
that
he
act
honestly,
that
is
the
only
claim
we
make
and
i
suggest
to
you
to
say
that
we
can't
even
inquire
into
his
honesty
which
has
never
been
subject
to
any
open
democratic
process
is
in
effect
to
seriously
endanger
the
citizenry
and
to
give
a
governor
or
generals
an
absolute
unbridled
license
without
any
review
or
inquiry
at
all
except
who
knows
how
long
after
in
the
electoral
process.
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
intent
of
the
civil
rights
act
at
all
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
i
have,
unless
there
are
questions,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
indicate
to
the
court,
if
the
court
will
examine
the
proclamations
of
the
governor,
it
will
find
that
the
one
that
is
applicable
to
the
kent
state
incident
which
is
the
main
fifth
proclamation
after
it
occurred
does
not
mention
anything
roving
bodies
of
men.
that
referred
to
a
truckers’
strike
where
there
may
well
have
been
roving
bodies
of
men
and
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
kent
state.
it
didn’t
even
include
portage
county
although
it
included
vast
other
areas
of
the
state
of
ohio.
the
fact
is
that
the
governor’s
proclamation
at
no
time
even
mentions
the
word
insurrection.
it
doesn’t
even,
if
we
want
to
talk
about
well-pleaded
facts,
the
governors’
proclamation
has
no
facts
which
would
give
rise
to
a
conclusion
that
there
was
a
state
of
insurrection
or
riot
of
any
kind.
it
simply
refers
to
disorders.
now,
i
want
to
be
perfectly
clear
about
our
contention
here.
it
is
not
our
contention
that
the
governor
is
liable
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act
because
he
called
out
troops.
that
is
not
our
claim.
we
are
claiming
and
what
has
been
read
by
my
brother
in
connection
with
sterling
against
constantin.
what
hasn’t
been
read
is
this,
while
the
calling
out
of
troops
is
unreviewable
according
to
that
case,
it
goes
further
and
it
says,
it
does
not
follow
from
the
fact
that
the
executive
has
this
range
of
discretion
deemed
to
be
a
necessary
incident
of
this
power
to
suppress
disorder.
that
every
sort
of
action
the
governor
may
take,
no
matter
how
unjustified
by
the
exigency
or
subversive
of
private
right
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
otherwise
available
is
conclusively
supported
by
mere
executive
fiat.
the
contrary
is
well-established.
what
are
the
allowable
limits
of
military
discretion
and
whether
or
not
they
have
been
overstepped
in
a
particular
case
are
judicial
questions
and
that
is
what
we
are
contending
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
this
matter
of
pleadings
and
what
is
well-pleaded
and
what
isn’t
pleaded.
i
understand,
at
least,
as
a
trial
practitioner
who
engages
in
some
amount
of
litigation,
i
have
always
understood
that
the
basic
concept
is
notice
to
pleading.
that
we
are
not
required
to
plead
volumes
of
evidence
or
any
evidence
really
that
i
feel
it
was
improper
to
plead
evidence
as
such
and
that
largely,
the
federal
rules
are
designed
to
confine
the
pleadings
to
the
general
allegations.
now,
we
have
alleged
a
conspiracy
to
engage
in
a
direct
act
which
involved
deaths
of
people
and
that’s
included
in
that
concept
those
orders
and
judgments
and
statements
in
their
backs
that
we
believe
exists
in
good
faith
to
back
it
up.
now,
what
i’m
simply
suggesting
is
this.
if
it
wasn’t
well-pleaded
and
not
for
my
brother,
mr.
alloway,
then
he
had
the
prerogative
under
the
rule
12
(e)
to
tell
me
that
and
to
make
a
motion
to
make
definite
and
certain
and
to
ask
me
to
be
more
specific
if
i
didn’t
plead
it
well
enough
and
he
didn’t
do
that.
he
didn’t
ask
me
for
more
facts.
he
didn’t
say,
“it’s
so
vague
that
it’s
not
well-pleaded.”
he
didn’t
say,
“we
don’t
have
notice.
we
don’t
know
what
you’re
talking
about.”
instead,
he
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
thereafter,
invited
the
court
to
conclude.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
you’re
right,
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
he
has
every
right
to
suggest
that
it’s
infirm
and
i
claim
that
where
we
had
specifically
alleged
and
i
quote
from
the
complaint,
“all
acts
herein
mentioned
including
everyone
of
them,
the
shooting
and
everything
else
were
done
individually
and
in
conspiracy
by
these
defendants
with
the
specific
intent
of
depriving
plaintiff
and
plaintiff
dissidents
of
their
rights
to
due
process
and
equal
protection.
i
contend
that
if
that
doesn’t
state
a
violation
of
constitutional
right,
then
nothing
does.
now,
if
he
wants
it
more
specific
than
that,
then
i
suggest
that
he
ask
what
he
wants,
that
he
tell
me
that
it’s
to
vague
and
that’s
the
question
of
pleading.
but
what
i
have
said
here
in
its
allegation
form
and
in
its
notice
form
is
well-pleaded
in
the
concept
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
give
notice
and
let’s
be
practical
about
it.
i
sit
in
an
office
that
has
four
walls
and
i
look
at
what
facts
i
have
at
the
time
i
plead
and
i
know
that
the
governor
was
down
there,
that
he
was
involved
in
this
event,
that
he
was
personally
present,
that
he
was
giving
orders,
that
he
was
doing
a
lot
of
things.
i’m
not
the
fbi.
i
don’t
have
those
materials
available.
i
only
have
what
i
know
and
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
basis
of
all
those
orders
that
were
apparently
given
when
he
stood
there
and
said
publicly
that
we
should
eradicate
people
and
that
these
people
should
be
eradicated
and
that
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
and
i
don’t
want
to
get
to
far
off
the
record
except
to
say
that
when
all
those
things
were
present
before
me,
all
i
can
say
is,
“i
thought
that
there
were
some
basis
to
make
the
allegation”
and
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
ask
him
some
very
specific
questions
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
absolutely.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
absolutely,
he
was
running
for
political
office
at
the
time.
he
was
running
at
a
law
and
order
platform.
i
would
like
to
ask
him
some
questions.
what
orders
did
you
give
to
your
guardsmen?
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
i’m
sorry.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
no.
not
because
he
was
running
for
office
because
of
his
desire
to
be
elected
and
to
demonstrate.
i’m
saying,
allegedly
to
demonstrate
to
the
electorate.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
as
i
unders
--
did
i
have?
i
had
the
basis
for
saying
that
he
was
malicious
in
the
concept
of
malice
that
to
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
right.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
yes.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
and
again,
the
concept
of
malice
is
involved
here
vindictiveness,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
orders
are
given
in
order
to
further
a
political
goal
which
involves
the
risk
of
injury
to
an
individual
and
perhaps
an
intent
to
create
a
demonstration
that
this
particular
were
going
to
show
the
people
that
i
stand
for
one
order
notwithstanding
the
risk
to
the
lives
of
the
people
involved,
i
think
that
comes
within
the
concept
of
certainly
wanton
and
willful
and
if
you
will,
malice.
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
that’s
what
i
would
like
to
ask
him
about.
that’s
what
i
would
like
to
get
into
it
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
well,
[laughter
attempt]
i’d
like
to
ask
him
the
questions
that
pertain
to
the
allegations
which
i
think
have
been
reasonably
filed.
yes,
and
i
think
there’s
a
basis
for
so
doing.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don’t
believe
that
this
case
can
be
decided
with
respect
to
the
questions
of
law
that
are
presented
without
a
reference,
at
least
some
reference
point
to
what
the
record
contains
with
regard
to
the
facts
and
i
think
something
has
to
be
said
in
that
regard.
the
complaint
filed
in
this
action
clearly
state
what
would
otherwise
be
a
cause
of
action
as
at
least,
i
can
best
understand
it.
we
have
alleged
that
four
innocent
students
were
shot
on
a
college
campus
without
any
justification.
we
have
alleged,
members
of
this
supreme
court,
we
have
alleged
that
the
governor
and
the
generals
conspired
intentionally
to
deprive
these
people
with
the
specific
intent
and
bad
faith
in
effect
of
their
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
and
under
1983.
we
have
alleged
that
these
facts
are
true
and
that
they
can
be
proven.
we
were
confronted
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
which
as
i
understand
it
and
notwithstanding
any
affidavit
that
was
ever
filed,
and
this
record
contains,
if
anything,
the
liberal
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
by
some
of
these
defendants.
we
have
alleged,
in
these
cases,
that
there
was
no
justification
for
it
and
nevertheless,
and
not
withstanding
that
and
based
upon
what
we
felt
in
effect
were
news
media
accounts
of
this
incident
that
the
passions
of
the
headlines
were
substituted
for
the
rules
of
evidence
in
this
case.
and
i
quote
specifically,
where
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
lower
court
said
that
“the
pleadings
clearly
contrive
to
hide
rather
than
disclose
the
true
background
of
the
events”
and
the
predicated
causes
of
action
without
disclosing
their
true
subject
matter,
without
any
evidence
before
that
court
to
so
find,
that
is
exactly
what
was
said.
the
majority
opinion
in
the
lower
court
is
infected
with
statement
after
statement
that
there
was
a
riot,
that
there
was
an
insurrection,
that
there
was
a
rebellion
and
members
of
this
court,
even
the
governor
of
the
state
of
ohio
the
after
it
occurred
never
used
a
word
like
that,
in
his
proclamations
to
justify
it,
not
one
word
to
that
effect,
nevertheless,
the
court
has
so
found.
now,
i’m
not
suggesting
anything
except
that
there
is
a
colorable
claim.
what
as
juxtaposed
to
these
allegations
have
the
defendants
set?
they
have
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
at
least
nine
times
in
response
to
material
interrogatories
and
more
importantly,
if
we
are
going
to
take
judicial
notice,
let
us
then
take
judicial
notice
of
one
responsible
investigative
organ
of
this
nation
and
that
is
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
where
it
was
specifically
stated
and
i’m
quoting
at
pages
24
and
25
of
our
brief
things
like
these.
“we
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
claim
by
the
national
guard
that
their
lives
were
endangered
by
the
students
was
fabricated
subsequent
to
the
event.
one
guardsman
admitted
that
his
life
was
not
endangered
and
that
he
fired
indiscriminately
into
the
crowd.
he
further
stated
that
the
guardsman
had
gotten
together
after
the
shooting
and
decided
to
fabricate
the
story
that
they
were
in
danger
of
seriously
bodily
harm
or
death
from
the
students.
no,
the
guardsmen
were
not
surrounded.
no
guardsman
claims
he
was
hit
with
rocks
immediately
prior
to
the
firing.
there
was
no
sniper.
some
guardsman
are
known
is
yet
had
to
be
physically
restrained
from
continuing
to
fire
their
weapons,”
directly
quoted.
the
people
shot
in
this
case
were
over
a
football
field
away.
one
man
sits
here
today
in
a
wheelchair
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
and
i
say
that
if
we
are
going
to
substitute
in
the
court
of
law,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
news
media
headlines
or
whatever
predilections
of
the
facts
the
court
may
have
for
the
presentation
of
evidence
in
its
orderly
course
then
i
say
that
we
have
really
reached
the
stage
where
the
rudimentary
concepts
of
due
process
of
law
have
been
violated
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
shocking
departure
from
procedure
at
least
as
i’ve
always
understood
it
in
the
past.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
there
was
no
claim
of
insurrection.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case,
not
only
the
day
after
the
shooting
and
having
this
proclamation
did
he
use
insurrection,
rebellion,
invasion,
riot,
tumult
or
any
such
words,
but
your
honors,
in
addition
to
that,
months
later
with
the
advice
presumably
of
competent
counsel,
my
brother
here,
then
he
indeed
not
say
anything
more
than
if
there
were
threatened
disorders
and
breaches
of
the
peace
in
the
answers
to
interrogatories
that
are
part
of
the
record
of
this
court.
the
president’s
commission
on
campus
unrest
said
that
this
shooting
was
unwarranted,
inexcusable
and
unjustified.
it
is
our
view
that
the
rules
of
evidence
cannot
be
supplemented
by
the
factual
predilections
of
a
judge
reviewing
a
complaint
not
a
summary
judgment
motion,
but
a
complaint.
now,
specifically
dealing
with
the
question
of
immunity
and
i
think
it’s
important
that
we
do
that
here,
in
this
regard.
in
sterling
against
constantin,
that
supreme
court
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
a
governor,
governor
constantin
had
issued
a
proclamation
which
was
stronger
than
the
one
issued
by
governor
rhodes.
it
said
that
there
was
an
insurrection.
it
said
that
there
was
a
rebellion.
it
said
that
there
was
a
state
of
affairs
which
justified
the
calling
of
martial
law.
and
nevertheless,
the
district
court
went
on
to
find
behind
those
allegations
of
the
governor
in
his
proclamation
that
that
wasn’t
true.
and
in
fact,
no
such
thing
existed
except
what
they
characterized
as
breaches
of
the
peace
and
when
the
governor
and
the
generals
came
to
this
court
and
said,
“we
are
immune
under
the
eleventh
amendment,”
this
court
specifically
held
that
a
federal
court
has
ample
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
veracity
of
those
allegations
with
evidence
properly
presented
before
them.
and
i
think
the
case
of
moyer
against
peabody
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
one
and
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
point.
indeed,
moyer
was
a
1983
action
and
there’s
no
question
about
that.
but
what
is
important
to
recognize
about
moyer
and
again
i
must
return
to
the
facts
because
i
think
they’re
critical.
in
that
case,
the
governor
and
the
complainant
both
agreed
on
two
things.
they
agreed,
number
one,
without
dispute
that
an
insurrection
existed
and
they
agreed
that
the
governor
acted
in
good
faith.
those
were
stipulated
facts
before
that
court
and
i
quote
the
language
when
i
say
that
the
court,
the
supreme
court,
in
its
opinion
said,
“we
are
here
assuming
that
there
was
no
insurrection,
excuse
me,
that
there
was
an
insurrection
and
that
he
exercised
good
faith
and
the
only
claim
is
that
he
was
unreasonable
in
arresting
moyer
under
those
circumstances.”
now,
this
is
not
such
a
case.
there
is
no
agreement
amongst
counsel
in
this
case
that
a
state
of
insurrection
existed.
instead,
we
have
alleged
there
was
a
peaceful
gathering
on
a
college
campus
with
bullets
intervening,
the
break
up
what
otherwise
was
a
peaceful
gathering
on
a
college
campus.
now,
if
we
can't
prove
that,
then
we
should
lose.
but
if
we
can
prove
it,
it’s
not
a
moyer
case.
we
do
not
agree,
as
counsel
did
in
moyer
that
there
was
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
governor.
to
the
contrary,
it
is
our
allegation
in
this
case,
and
it
is
our
intention
to
prove
that
the
governor
was
personally
involved
in
this
situation.
that
as
commander-in-chief,
remember
this
was
a
trial
several
days
before
the
republic
senator,
senatorial
primary
and
without
editorializing
on
the
validity
of
the
law
and
order
position
that
he
was
taking
the
fact
is
that
that
was
his
position
that
he
advanced
in
that
particular
situation
and
here
was
threatened
disorder
and
he
just
wasn’t
sitting
behind
his
desk,
receiving
information
of
an
alarming
situation
and
sending
troops
out,
he
went
down
there
to
that
campus,
the
day
before
this
incident
occurred.
he
made
a
speech
in
the
presence
of
the
commanding
general
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
yes
sir.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
i
would
want
to
--
i
want
to
stop
going
away
from
this
record
for
this
reason.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
your
honor,
i
want
to
go
to
court
and
i
want
to
prove
these
things
and
the
reason
that
i
bring
these
things
into
the
case
is
to,
is
simply
because
three
of
the
reviewing
judges
in
this
case,
three
of
them,
have
gone
outside
the
record
and
refused
to
believe
that
the
allegations
were
true.
that’s
why
i
go
outside
the
record
not
to
convince
you
that
what
i
say
is
proof
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
to
convince
you
that
there
are
allegations
which
weren’t
the
right
to
present
evidence
in
a
court.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
all
you
have
to
do
is
agree
with
me
that
the
complaint’s
allegation
should
be
taken
as
true
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we’re
entitled
to
prove
them.
i
would
like
specifically,
in
regard
to
the
eleventh
amendment
intention
and
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
that
for
a
moment.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
distinction
that
has
been
made
here
between
a
statute
that
an
unconstitutional
action
under
a
statute
that
is
allegedly
unconstitutional
is
different
than
an
action
which
is
just
plain
unconstitutional
because
of
the
nature
of
the
action,
really
was
never
intended
as
a
distinction
to
be
engrafted
upon
the
civil
rights
act
at
all.
congress
intended
to
reach
the
unconstitutional
effect
if
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court.
it
says,
“every
person
who
acts
not
under
a
statute,
not
under
without
a
statute,
within
the
statute,
every
person
who
acts
under
color
of
law
to
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
another
is
libel
for
that
action.”
every
person
and
it
doesn’t
engraft
any
distinction
at
all.
the
only
reason
we’re
not
seeking
an
injunction
in
this
case
and
it
says
in
that
statute,
an
action
at
law
equity
or
other
proper
redress
the
breadth
is
broad.
we
can't
seek
an
injunction
in
this
case.
all
we
have
is
the
available
remedy
of
damages.
that’s
obvious
from
the
circumstances
and
therefore
we
are
well
within
the
terms
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
to
say
that
only
where
a
statute
exists
that’s
unconstitutional,
can
the
civil
rights
act
apply
as
to
i
think
emasculate
the
very
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
which
was
to
reach
the
state
official
himself
for
the
affect
of
what
he
did.
and
this
court
has
never
held
for
example
in
dealing
with
police
officers
in
monroe
against
pape
or
egan
against
the
city
of
aurora,
in
any
of
those
cases
that
because
they
were
acting
under
color
of
a
valid
statute,
that
therefore
for
some
reason,
they
were
immune.
that
would
be
inconsistent,
i
think
with
the
entire
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act.
they
were
conducting
actions
not
under
a
statute,
but
on
their
own
which
were
unconstitutional,
which
violated
the
rights
of
those
individuals,
and
therefore,
they
were
held
inappropriately
so
by
this
court
to
be
within
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
civil
rights
act.
it
seems
to
me
that
cases
like
ex
parte
young,
sterling
against
constantin,
griffin
against
the
board
of
prince
edward
county,
all
the
way
ranging
from
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
right
up
until
the
present
time
have
all
held
that
where
an
injunction
is
the
appropriate
form
of
redress,
the
civil
rights
act
makes
no
distinction
between
damages
and
injunction.
that
issue
has
been
raised
here
and
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
difference
because
the
sterling
specifically
holds
that
an
injunction
is
a
more
extraordinary
remedy
and
damages
is
a
less
extraordinary
remedy
and
other
cases
if
so
held
as
well
of
this
court
and
i
don’t
see
the
difference.
it
depends
on
the
remedy
that’s
needed.
it
would
seem
on
the
damage
that
has
been
done
and
not
upon
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought.
congress
never
intended,
as
i
read
the
legislative
history,
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
to
make
a
distinction
between
damages
and
injunctive
relief
as
to
whether
or
not
there’s
immunity.
i
never
read
that
in
any
of
the
decisions
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
supportable
by
any
of
the
rules
of
law
that
have
been
promulgated
by
this
court
and
i’m
thinking
of
cases
like
mitchum
against
foster,
monroe
against
pape,
zwickler
against
koota
and
particularly
those
various
circuits
like
mclaughlin
against
tilendis,
jenkins
against
averett
was
a
damage
action,
many
cases
under
the
civil
rights
act
about
damages
where
damage
is
the
appropriate
remedy.
and
what
i
think
is
critical
here
is
that
we
did
bring
a
case
against
the
state
of
ohio.
we
sued
the
state
in
its
own
courts.
we
brought
that
case
and
we
contended
that
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
was
unconstitutional
in
violation
not
only
of
the
ohio
constitution,
but
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
mr.
justice
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
white
in
this
regard
and
i
don’t
mean
to
not
answer
your
question,
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
we
couldn’t
have
alleged
anything
stronger,
but
taking
it
a
step
down,
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
negligence
in
the
tort
sense
may
not
be
appropriate
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
well,
that’s
the
tort
standard
as
i
understand
it,
reasonable
conduct
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
well,
i
think
that
it’s
critical
too
as
you
point
out.
i
think
it’s
critical
to
an
interpretation
of
the
civil
rights
act
to
ask
what
the
state
of
mind
of
the
person
you’re
suing
is,
in
addition
to
what
the
result
was.
a
mere
accident
can
cause
a
terrible
tragedy
and
yet
not
create
liability.
it
is
my
suggestion
to
this
court
that
the
appropriate
standard
that
occurs
to
me
for
a
police
type
situation
is
in
jenkins
against
averett.
a
case
before
the
fourth
circuit,
i
believe,
where
it
was
held
that
in
that
particular
case,
an
act
of
wanton
misconduct,
a
very
high
degree
of
reckless
was
sufficient
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
at
least
a
high
degree
of
recklessness.
yes.
i
would
say
that
would
be
the
appropriate
standard
but
i
would
not
suggest
to
you
that
a
lower
standard
is
not
possible.
i’m
simply
saying
that
as
the
state
of
this
case
is
now,
i
don’t
see
how
we
could
have
alleged
anything
stronger
and
that’s
really
what
i’m
suggesting
in
this
particular
situation.
i
would
emphasize
that
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
amendment
claim,
your
honors,
that
this
case
is
not
a
case
against
the
state.
the
state
is
not
a
party
to
this
action.
no
money
is
being
sought
from
the
state
treasury
at
all.
no
judgment
rendered
in
this
case
will
require
a
state
official
to
take
any
action
or
prohibit
a
state
official
from
taking
any
action.
this
is
not
an
action
even
against
state
officials.
the
present
defendants
in
this
case
aren’t
even
officials
from
the
state
of
ohio
at
all
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
entire
body
of
eleventh
amendment
law
as
i
read
it
suggests
that
in
such
a
case
where
the
individual
act
is
allegedly
unconstitutional
that
that
is
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
and
i
think
sterling
specifically
so
holds.
what
is
being
attempted
and
i
think
this
is
the
critical
distinction
here
and
if
i
understand
the
defendant’s
argument
is
that
we
shouldn’t
just
consider
these
things,
but
we
should
ask
ourselves
what
will
be
the
effect
on
the
governor
in
the
future.
how
fearful
will
the
governor
be,
the
chief
executive
be
or
other
executives
below
him
and
i
might
add
it
goes
all
the
way
down
to
the
trigger
man
in
this
particular
case
and
the
court
held
that
everyone
to
be
immune
not
just
the
governor,
but
let’s
ask
that
question.
what
will
be
the
effect
that
the
state
government
will
not
be
able
to
operate
that
people
will
be
fearful
that
they
will
have
come
in
and
defend
lawsuits
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
if
i
understand
that
argument
correctly?
and
i
would
have
this
to
answer
to
it.
i
would
say
that
that
argument
can
be
made
in
every
single
case
under
1983.
there
is
no
case
where
it
cannot
be
argued
that
the
effect
of
suing
an
individual
for
damages
for
violating
constitutional
rights
be
the
governor
or
anyone
else
would
not
have
some
effect
on
their
future
conduct,
would
not
give
them
some
“pause
for
concern,”
would
not
inconvenience
them
in
some
way,
but
it
is
my
suggestion
that
the
act
was
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind.
that
was
the
very
effect
that
was
intended.
congress
passed
the
civil
rights
act
in
part
to
deter
this
very
kind
of
thing
and
if
we
are
to
give
meaning
to
that
enactment,
i
think
we
to
recognize
that
the
purpose
and
intent
of
that
particular
enactment
was
to
effectuate
the
deterrence
that
any
tort
remedy
has
and
this
a
congressionally
sanctioned
tort.
as
i
understand
section
1983,
it
is
both
a
compensatory
tort
action
as
well
as
having
a
deterrent
effect
and
the
deterred
effect
that
is
complained
of
here
is
the
very
purpose
of
enactment
in
the
first
place
and
so
to
say,
that
because
it
has
an
effect,
that
should
be
the
reason
to
bar
suits.
for
that
reason
alone,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
run
completely
contrary
to
the
whole
intent.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
should
hold
and
we’ve
sued
the
state
of
ohio
which
has
immunized
itself
in
the
state
courts,
if
this
court
holds
that
this
too
is
an
action
against
the
state,
then
we
are
really
left
without
a
remedy.
we
have
no
place
to
go.
then
this
court
has
permanently
and
forever
foreclosed
any
right
to
appear
in
a
court
of
law
anywhere
against
anyone
to
test
the
allegations
in
these
complaints
and
to
establish
any
form
of
redress.
this
court
will
--
“this
is
it!
this
is
our
last
opportunity
to
have
redress.
there
will
be
none.
we
can't
sue
the
state
in
its
own
courts
and
we
can't
if
this
court
should
hold
we
can't
sue
here
and
we’re
without
redress.”
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
the
question
of
immunity
as
it
applies
to
legislators
and
judges
and
that
has
been
raised
and
i
am
cognizant
of
pierson
against
ray
and
tenney
against
brandhove,
and
i
think
this
is
very
important.
first
of
all,
let
me
say
that
i
have
some
empathy
with
the
dissenting
opinions
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
those
cases
that
a
dishonest
legislature
if
it
so
alleged
and
a
dishonest
judge
should
be
subject
to
suit,
but
we
have
those
decisions
and
they
stand
as
they
do
now
and
i
suggest
this.
that
after
all
a
legislative
process
and
a
legislator
is
involved
in
a
deliberative
thing,
the
result
of
what
he
does
is
open
to
the
public.
he
has
the
opportunity,
first
he
must
concur
with
other
people.
if
his
enactment
is
going
to
be
harmful,
a
court
can
review
it.
all
of
this
process
can
take
place
and
there
is
full
opportunity
for
the
public
in
the
democratic
process
to
participate
and
so
perhaps
we
can
say
as
does
our
constitution
that
a
legislature
shall
not
be
examined
in
any
other
place
and
with
the
judge,
the
same
is
true.
it
is
an
open
process,
presumably,
a
deliberative
one.before
any
finality
takes
place,
a
court
can
review
that
action,
but
such
is
not
the
case
with
an
executive.
in
the
case
of
an
executive,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
actions
maybe
or
may
not
be
taken
with
deliberation,
but
not
necessarily
with
public
participation
at
that
time.
the
governor,
in
theory,
in
his
own
chambers
and
secretly
without
making
it
public,
open
up
and
decide
to
wheel
the
weapons
of
death
without
any
such
legislative
or
judicial
process
as
a
result
which
the
instant
action
of
a
bullet
terminates
a
youngster
or
man
or
anyone’s
life.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
executive
immunity
is
applied
in
that
situation
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
what
occurs
with
the
legislator
and
with
the
judge.
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
suggest
to
you
that
to
say
that
they
are
all
in
the
same
kind
is
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act
itself.
to
say
that
a
governor
cannot
even
be
or
a
general
or
a
guardsman
cannot
be
even
subject
to
inquiry
and
we
--
only
has
that
he
acts
honestly
in
this
case,
we
say
he
can
make
a
mistake,
that’s
okay.
is
that
he
act
honestly,
that
is
the
only
claim
we
make
and
i
suggest
to
you
to
say
that
we
can't
even
inquire
into
his
honesty
which
has
never
been
subject
to
any
open
democratic
process
is
in
effect
to
seriously
endanger
the
citizenry
and
to
give
a
governor
or
generals
an
absolute
unbridled
license
without
any
review
or
inquiry
at
all
except
who
knows
how
long
after
in
the
electoral
process.
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
intent
of
the
civil
rights
act
at
all
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
i
have,
unless
there
are
questions,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
indicate
to
the
court,
if
the
court
will
examine
the
proclamations
of
the
governor,
it
will
find
that
the
one
that
is
applicable
to
the
kent
state
incident
which
is
the
main
fifth
proclamation
after
it
occurred
does
not
mention
anything
roving
bodies
of
men.
that
referred
to
a
truckers’
strike
where
there
may
well
have
been
roving
bodies
of
men
and
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
kent
state.
it
didn’t
even
include
portage
county
although
it
included
vast
other
areas
of
the
state
of
ohio.
the
fact
is
that
the
governor’s
proclamation
at
no
time
even
mentions
the
word
insurrection.
it
doesn’t
even,
if
we
want
to
talk
about
well-pleaded
facts,
the
governors’
proclamation
has
no
facts
which
would
give
rise
to
a
conclusion
that
there
was
a
state
of
insurrection
or
riot
of
any
kind.
it
simply
refers
to
disorders.
now,
i
want
to
be
perfectly
clear
about
our
contention
here.
it
is
not
our
contention
that
the
governor
is
liable
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act
because
he
called
out
troops.
that
is
not
our
claim.
we
are
claiming
and
what
has
been
read
by
my
brother
in
connection
with
sterling
against
constantin.
what
hasn’t
been
read
is
this,
while
the
calling
out
of
troops
is
unreviewable
according
to
that
case,
it
goes
further
and
it
says,
it
does
not
follow
from
the
fact
that
the
executive
has
this
range
of
discretion
deemed
to
be
a
necessary
incident
of
this
power
to
suppress
disorder.
that
every
sort
of
action
the
governor
may
take,
no
matter
how
unjustified
by
the
exigency
or
subversive
of
private
right
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
otherwise
available
is
conclusively
supported
by
mere
executive
fiat.
the
contrary
is
well-established.
what
are
the
allowable
limits
of
military
discretion
and
whether
or
not
they
have
been
overstepped
in
a
particular
case
are
judicial
questions
and
that
is
what
we
are
contending
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
this
matter
of
pleadings
and
what
is
well-pleaded
and
what
isn’t
pleaded.
i
understand,
at
least,
as
a
trial
practitioner
who
engages
in
some
amount
of
litigation,
i
have
always
understood
that
the
basic
concept
is
notice
to
pleading.
that
we
are
not
required
to
plead
volumes
of
evidence
or
any
evidence
really
that
i
feel
it
was
improper
to
plead
evidence
as
such
and
that
largely,
the
federal
rules
are
designed
to
confine
the
pleadings
to
the
general
allegations.
now,
we
have
alleged
a
conspiracy
to
engage
in
a
direct
act
which
involved
deaths
of
people
and
that’s
included
in
that
concept
those
orders
and
judgments
and
statements
in
their
backs
that
we
believe
exists
in
good
faith
to
back
it
up.
now,
what
i’m
simply
suggesting
is
this.
if
it
wasn’t
well-pleaded
and
not
for
my
brother,
mr.
alloway,
then
he
had
the
prerogative
under
the
rule
12
(e)
to
tell
me
that
and
to
make
a
motion
to
make
definite
and
certain
and
to
ask
me
to
be
more
specific
if
i
didn’t
plead
it
well
enough
and
he
didn’t
do
that.
he
didn’t
ask
me
for
more
facts.
he
didn’t
say,
“it’s
so
vague
that
it’s
not
well-pleaded.”
he
didn’t
say,
“we
don’t
have
notice.
we
don’t
know
what
you’re
talking
about.”
instead,
he
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
thereafter,
invited
the
court
to
conclude.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
you’re
right,
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
he
has
every
right
to
suggest
that
it’s
infirm
and
i
claim
that
where
we
had
specifically
alleged
and
i
quote
from
the
complaint,
“all
acts
herein
mentioned
including
everyone
of
them,
the
shooting
and
everything
else
were
done
individually
and
in
conspiracy
by
these
defendants
with
the
specific
intent
of
depriving
plaintiff
and
plaintiff
dissidents
of
their
rights
to
due
process
and
equal
protection.
i
contend
that
if
that
doesn’t
state
a
violation
of
constitutional
right,
then
nothing
does.
now,
if
he
wants
it
more
specific
than
that,
then
i
suggest
that
he
ask
what
he
wants,
that
he
tell
me
that
it’s
to
vague
and
that’s
the
question
of
pleading.
but
what
i
have
said
here
in
its
allegation
form
and
in
its
notice
form
is
well-pleaded
in
the
concept
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
give
notice
and
let’s
be
practical
about
it.
i
sit
in
an
office
that
has
four
walls
and
i
look
at
what
facts
i
have
at
the
time
i
plead
and
i
know
that
the
governor
was
down
there,
that
he
was
involved
in
this
event,
that
he
was
personally
present,
that
he
was
giving
orders,
that
he
was
doing
a
lot
of
things.
i’m
not
the
fbi.
i
don’t
have
those
materials
available.
i
only
have
what
i
know
and
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
basis
of
all
those
orders
that
were
apparently
given
when
he
stood
there
and
said
publicly
that
we
should
eradicate
people
and
that
these
people
should
be
eradicated
and
that
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
and
i
don’t
want
to
get
to
far
off
the
record
except
to
say
that
when
all
those
things
were
present
before
me,
all
i
can
say
is,
“i
thought
that
there
were
some
basis
to
make
the
allegation”
and
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
ask
him
some
very
specific
questions
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
absolutely.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
absolutely,
he
was
running
for
political
office
at
the
time.
he
was
running
at
a
law
and
order
platform.
i
would
like
to
ask
him
some
questions.
what
orders
did
you
give
to
your
guardsmen?
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
i’m
sorry.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
no.
not
because
he
was
running
for
office
because
of
his
desire
to
be
elected
and
to
demonstrate.
i’m
saying,
allegedly
to
demonstrate
to
the
electorate.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
as
i
unders
--
did
i
have?
i
had
the
basis
for
saying
that
he
was
malicious
in
the
concept
of
malice
that
to
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
right.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
yes.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
and
again,
the
concept
of
malice
is
involved
here
vindictiveness,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
orders
are
given
in
order
to
further
a
political
goal
which
involves
the
risk
of
injury
to
an
individual
and
perhaps
an
intent
to
create
a
demonstration
that
this
particular
were
going
to
show
the
people
that
i
stand
for
one
order
notwithstanding
the
risk
to
the
lives
of
the
people
involved,
i
think
that
comes
within
the
concept
of
certainly
wanton
and
willful
and
if
you
will,
malice.
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
that’s
what
i
would
like
to
ask
him
about.
that’s
what
i
would
like
to
get
into
it
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
well,
[laughter
attempt]
i’d
like
to
ask
him
the
questions
that
pertain
to
the
allegations
which
i
think
have
been
reasonably
filed.
yes,
and
i
think
there’s
a
basis
for
so
doing.
mr.
steven
a.
sindell
i
have
nothing
further.
