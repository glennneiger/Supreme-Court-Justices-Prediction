mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
address
a
preliminary
remark
as
to
my
posture
in
this
case
while
i
am
of
counsel
in
both
the
scheuer
case
which
has
just
been
heard
and
the
krause
and
miller
cases
which
are
being
heard
together
at
this
time.
i
represent
governor
rhodes
in
his
individual
capacity
and
i
am
fully
cooperative
with
all
defense
counsel
in
this
case
and
i
endorse
my
brother,
charles
brown’s
argument
in
all
respects.
there
are
some
things
that
i
believe
are
applicable
peculiarly
to
governor
rhodes
which
ought
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
i’m
prepared
to
answer
questions
on
any
aspect
of
the
case,
but
my
argument
in
chief
will
be
addressed
to
the
governor
rhodes’
position
primarily.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
case
of
sterling
versus
constantin
as
it
may
have
limited
or
may
not
have
limited
ex
parte
moyer.
i
believe
it
did
not
limit
it
in
any
material
respect.
the
requirement
of
sterling
versus
constantin
is
expressed
at
287
united
states
399
by
virtue
of
his
duty
to
cause
the
loss
to
be
faithful
executive,
faithfully
executed.
the
executive
has
appropriately
vested
with
the
discretion
to
determine
whether
an
exigency
requiring
military
aid
for
that
purpose
has
a
arisen.
his
decision
to
that
effect
is
conclusive.
now,
the
way
sterling
versus
constantin
arose
there
were
stipulations
and
there
was
evidence
taken
which
made
it
appear
to
the
court,
to
the
district
court
which
had
also
had
some
prior
jurisdiction
on
some
of
the
same
controversy
that
this
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
governor
of
texas
was
not
in
entire
good
faith,
that
is,
it
was
not
within
the
limits
of
his
discretionary
power.
since
he
was
using
it
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
the
production
of
oil,
even
though
the
expression
was
made
that
there
were
tumultuous
conditions,
the
proclamation,
i
might
say,
in
the
sterling
case
is
very
similar
to
the
proclamation
in
the
instant
case.
that
is,
i
am
speaking
of
the
proclamation
of
april
29th,
1970.
but
in
this
case,
the
governor
was
exercising
as
executive
discretion
with
respect
to
calling
out
the
guard
and
had
proclaimed
that
there
were
riotous
conditions,
that
there
was
tumult,
that
there
was
danger
to
persons
and
property
and
this,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
felt
was
a
matter
of
judicial
notice.
that
there
was
sufficient
notoriety
in
the
situation
of
the
campuses
in
ohio
and
indeed
throughout
the
nation
in
may
of
1970
that
the
court
could
not
effect
to
be
ignorant
of
the
situation.
my
brother,
mr.
sindell,
has
made
a
very
emotional
argument
with
respect
and
running
along
pretty
much
along
the
lines
of
his
brief,
but
he
does
not
get
into
the
actual
allegations
of
the
complaint.
if
one
goes
to
the
actual
allegations
of
the
complaint,
one
must
find
that
there
are
only
mere
conclusions
as
to
the
part
which
governor
rhodes
took
in
the
matter
other
than
the
fact
that
he
did
issue
a
proclamation
and
that
he
did
call
out
the
guard.
in
order
to
state
a
cause
of
action,
here,
i
can
understand
that
the
question
might
be
anticipated
just
what
can
a
plaintiff
do.
suppose
a
governor
maliciously
and
corruptly
and
wantonly
and
evilly,
let
us
say,
decides
to
call
out
the
national
guard
for
the
specific
purpose
of
extinguishing
a
life.
if
he
does
that,
surely
there
are
facts
which
could
be
stated
in
a
complaint
other
than
the
bare
conclusion
that
the
defendants
conspired
to
deprive
the
plaintiff
or
the
decedents
of
their
civil
rights
in
each
of
these
cases.
there
are
--
there
must
be
other
facts
available
which
could
be
pleaded
which
would
support
that
situation.
obviously,
there
are
not
and
obviously,
there
was
a
situation
in
which
it
could
not
be
reasonable
to
conclude
from
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
itself
in
either
of
these
cases
or
in
any
of
these
cases.
that
the
governor
conspired
and
--
evilly,
corruptly
and
we
can
use
other
adverbs,
to
deprive
these
decedents
of
their
civil
rights.
these
conclusions
are
not
reasonable
under
the
facts
well-pleaded
in
the
complaints.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
below
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
majority
of
the
two
was
correct
that
the
12
(b)
(1)
motion
to
dismiss
was
properly
sustained.
we
submit
further
that
there
are
other
reasons
on
which
looking
only
at
governor
rhodes’
particular
situation
one
must
conclude
reasonably
from
the
allegations
of
the
complaints
that
there
were
substantial
intervening
causes,
if
anything,
in
connection
with
governor
rhodes’
proclamation
cause
the
death
of
these
unfortunate
people.
there
were
intelligent
intervening
substantial
forces
which
intervened
between
the
proclamation
which
is
all
that
is
actually
shown
to
have
been
promulgated
by
governor
rhodes.
therefore,
on
other
grounds,
the
motion
to
dismiss
would
properly
have
been
sustained.
i
submit
also
that
the
question
of
whether
a
state
employee,
if
a
national
guard
can
be
an
employee
or
a
state
officer,
whether
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
applies
and
in
this
instance,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
authority
for
applying
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
so
as
to
bring
governor
rhodes
within
the
ambit
of
a
proper
action
against
him
in
these
cases.
and
for
all
of
those
reasons
and
for
the
reasons,
my
brother,
mr.
brown
has
set
forth,
i
would
say
that
governor
rhodes
is
in
a
fortiori
situation
with
respect
to
all
of
the
defendants.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
only
seven
defendants
in
this
case.
there
are,
as
mr.
sindell
refers
to
them,
the
trigger
man,
there
are
no
persons
alleged
to
have
been
trigger
man
in
these
instances.
and
those
must
be
taken
as
admissions
in
the
briefs
and
as
judicial
admissions
that
there
are
no
persons
who
are
so
charged
in
this
case.
so,
with
respect
to
governor
rhodes,
any
liability
which
applies
to
him
must
be
on
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
which
we
suggest
is
clearly
not
applicable.
i
have
nothing
--
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
would
say
if
the
arming
of
the
national
guard
is
in
and
of
itself
an
act
on
his
or
is
a
culpable
act,
yes
just
as
he
is
personally
charged
with
having
issued
the
proclamation
which
called
out
the
guard.
yes,
he
is,
if
that
is
a
culpable
act,
he
is
culpable.
i
submit
that
neither
of
those
acts
is
one
on
which
culpability
can
arise
because
the
training
of
the
guard
is
and
this
is
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
and
is
in
the
record,
that
the
training
of
the
guard
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
united
states
government
and
was
at
that
time.
the
training
of
the
guard
was
a
responsibility
of
the
united
states
military
officers
and
the
duty,
the
constitutional
and
statutory
duty
of
governor
rhodes
was
to
call
out
the
guard
and
the
arming
of
the
guard
and
the
actions
of
the
guard
were
the
responsibility
of
the
individuals
and
of
any
commanding
officers
who
issued
commands.
i
would
submit
that
the
act
of
calling
out
an
armed
guard
is
the
risk
that
one
takes
anytime
a
national
guard
unit
is
called
out.
it
is
within
the
realm
of
possibility
that
in
the
discretion
of
officers
having
discretion,
there
may
be
live
ammunition
used.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
yes.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
think
i
should
place
the
emphasis
on
the
words
well-pleaded.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
yes,
it
is
certainly
an
accepted
proposition,
yes.
and
i
would
place
strong
emphasis
on
the
matter
of
the
words
well-pleaded
because
i
would
submit
that
this
court
should
not
approve
retrospectively
or
prospectively
the
irresponsible
use
of
inflammatory
language
in
pleadings,
and
therefore,
then
take
the
allegations
as
true.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
plus,
if
your
honor
please,
matters
of
which
the
court
can
properly
take
judicial
notice
and
the
only
fact
which
i’m
suggesting
--
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
one
exception
to
the
rule
would
certainly
be
the
situation
of
the
campuses
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
in
the,
over
the
country
generally
in
may
of
1970.
and
that
there
were
at
those
times
riotous
situations
where
unusual
measures
had
to
be
taken.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
if
the
court
did
commit
error
in
respect
of
its
statements,
nevertheless,
the
judgment
of
the
court
taking
the
narrowest
construction
of
any
judicial
notice
which
it
had
a
right
to
take
was
sufficient
on
which
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
for
instance,
the
proclamation
of
governor
rhodes
is
a
document
of
which
judicial
notice
could
and
should
properly
have
been
taken
judicial
notice.
and
that
the
facts
well-pleaded
plus
properly
judicially
noticed
facts
are
sufficient.
now,
i
would
suggest,
for
instance,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
we’re
going
to
take
facts
well-pleaded
and
let’s
say
that
we
have
to
allege
in
order
to
plead
a
cause
of
action
that
there
were
no
roving
bands
of
men
bent
upon
destruction
of
property
and
endangering
life,
that
allegation
might
have
been
made,
but
it
was
not
made.
that
would
not
have
been
a
conclusion.
that
would
have
been
a
statement
of
fact.
i
would
submit
that
it’s
a
conclusion
that
the
plaintiff’s
attorney
could
not
in
good
conscience
have
made,
but
it
would
be
a
statement
of
fact
that
would
be
one.
if
we
would
take
for
instance
a
statement
that
the
rotc
building
did
not
burn
down
the
night
before
in
the
city
of
kent,
that
would
be
an
allegation
of
fact.
it
would
not
be
an
allegation
which
the
plaintiff
could
in
good
conscience
make,
but
it
would
be
an
allegation
of
fact
which
would
support
the
complaint
beyond
the
support
that
it
needs,
beyond
the
support
which
it
does
not
have.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
would
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
generally
disorderly
conditions
in
the
area
of
kent,
ohio
including
the
kent
university
campus.
therefore,
we
are
in
the
situation
where
sterling
versus
constantin
applies
to
make
the
action
of
the
governor
of
ohio
not
reviewable.
if
not
being
reviewable,
i
would
say
further
that
the
natural
consequences
of
his
act
are
also
not
reviewable
under
the
doctrine
of
executive
immunity.
under
that,
the
court
had
sufficient
before
it
to
make
those
determinations
of
fact
in
a
general
way.
whether
or
not
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
specific
fact
of
the
burning
of
the
rotc
building,
i
would
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
could.
that
was
a
widely-known
fact,
that
was
perhaps
almost
as
widely-known
effect,
certainly
as
widely-known
in
the
midwest
area
as
the
killing
of
donald
or
lee
harvey
oswald
by
jack
ruby.
the
burning
of
the
rotc
building
was
a
notorious
event
viewed
by
millions
of
people.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
would
say
that
the
court
might
do
so,
although
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
for
the
court
to
do
that
because
insurrection
is
not
a
sine
qua
non
of
the
proper
exercise
of
the
discretionary
power
of
the
governor
to
call
out
the
guard.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
it
is
a
--
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
it
is
a
very
complicated
term.
i
don’t
think
it
is
a
term
which
we
necessarily
must
find
in
order
to
find
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
district
court.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i’m
sorry.
i
don’t
believe
i
follow
that.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
yes.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
will
have
to
confess
to
you,
i
have
not
thought
about
it
and
i
think
that
i
would
say,
probably
not.
that
your
honor
has
just
said
that
the
term
insurrection
is
a
very
complicated
term
which
is
widely
embracing
and
has
many
legal
consequences.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
it
is
a
legal
conclusion
and
not
a
fact,
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
well,
we
have
the
governor’s
proclamation,
but
we
have
some
specific
facts
in
the
governor’s
proclamation
that
in
the
territory
of
northeastern
ohio,
there
were
roving
bands
of
men
who
were
committing
acts
of
violence.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
think
the
court
can
take
that
as
true.
it
is
a
fact.
it
is
a
fact
as
distinguished
from
a
conclusion.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
again,
i
respectfully
--
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
--
emphasize
the
words
well-pleaded
and
i
submit
that
if
the
court
will
examine
each
complaint,
it
will
find
that
the
“facts”
are
conclusions.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
yes.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
that’s
true.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
address
a
preliminary
remark
as
to
my
posture
in
this
case
while
i
am
of
counsel
in
both
the
scheuer
case
which
has
just
been
heard
and
the
krause
and
miller
cases
which
are
being
heard
together
at
this
time.
i
represent
governor
rhodes
in
his
individual
capacity
and
i
am
fully
cooperative
with
all
defense
counsel
in
this
case
and
i
endorse
my
brother,
charles
brown’s
argument
in
all
respects.
there
are
some
things
that
i
believe
are
applicable
peculiarly
to
governor
rhodes
which
ought
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
i’m
prepared
to
answer
questions
on
any
aspect
of
the
case,
but
my
argument
in
chief
will
be
addressed
to
the
governor
rhodes’
position
primarily.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
case
of
sterling
versus
constantin
as
it
may
have
limited
or
may
not
have
limited
ex
parte
moyer.
i
believe
it
did
not
limit
it
in
any
material
respect.
the
requirement
of
sterling
versus
constantin
is
expressed
at
287
united
states
399
by
virtue
of
his
duty
to
cause
the
loss
to
be
faithful
executive,
faithfully
executed.
the
executive
has
appropriately
vested
with
the
discretion
to
determine
whether
an
exigency
requiring
military
aid
for
that
purpose
has
a
arisen.
his
decision
to
that
effect
is
conclusive.
now,
the
way
sterling
versus
constantin
arose
there
were
stipulations
and
there
was
evidence
taken
which
made
it
appear
to
the
court,
to
the
district
court
which
had
also
had
some
prior
jurisdiction
on
some
of
the
same
controversy
that
this
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
governor
of
texas
was
not
in
entire
good
faith,
that
is,
it
was
not
within
the
limits
of
his
discretionary
power.
since
he
was
using
it
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
the
production
of
oil,
even
though
the
expression
was
made
that
there
were
tumultuous
conditions,
the
proclamation,
i
might
say,
in
the
sterling
case
is
very
similar
to
the
proclamation
in
the
instant
case.
that
is,
i
am
speaking
of
the
proclamation
of
april
29th,
1970.
but
in
this
case,
the
governor
was
exercising
as
executive
discretion
with
respect
to
calling
out
the
guard
and
had
proclaimed
that
there
were
riotous
conditions,
that
there
was
tumult,
that
there
was
danger
to
persons
and
property
and
this,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
felt
was
a
matter
of
judicial
notice.
that
there
was
sufficient
notoriety
in
the
situation
of
the
campuses
in
ohio
and
indeed
throughout
the
nation
in
may
of
1970
that
the
court
could
not
effect
to
be
ignorant
of
the
situation.
my
brother,
mr.
sindell,
has
made
a
very
emotional
argument
with
respect
and
running
along
pretty
much
along
the
lines
of
his
brief,
but
he
does
not
get
into
the
actual
allegations
of
the
complaint.
if
one
goes
to
the
actual
allegations
of
the
complaint,
one
must
find
that
there
are
only
mere
conclusions
as
to
the
part
which
governor
rhodes
took
in
the
matter
other
than
the
fact
that
he
did
issue
a
proclamation
and
that
he
did
call
out
the
guard.
in
order
to
state
a
cause
of
action,
here,
i
can
understand
that
the
question
might
be
anticipated
just
what
can
a
plaintiff
do.
suppose
a
governor
maliciously
and
corruptly
and
wantonly
and
evilly,
let
us
say,
decides
to
call
out
the
national
guard
for
the
specific
purpose
of
extinguishing
a
life.
if
he
does
that,
surely
there
are
facts
which
could
be
stated
in
a
complaint
other
than
the
bare
conclusion
that
the
defendants
conspired
to
deprive
the
plaintiff
or
the
decedents
of
their
civil
rights
in
each
of
these
cases.
there
are
--
there
must
be
other
facts
available
which
could
be
pleaded
which
would
support
that
situation.
obviously,
there
are
not
and
obviously,
there
was
a
situation
in
which
it
could
not
be
reasonable
to
conclude
from
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
itself
in
either
of
these
cases
or
in
any
of
these
cases.
that
the
governor
conspired
and
--
evilly,
corruptly
and
we
can
use
other
adverbs,
to
deprive
these
decedents
of
their
civil
rights.
these
conclusions
are
not
reasonable
under
the
facts
well-pleaded
in
the
complaints.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
below
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
majority
of
the
two
was
correct
that
the
12
(b)
(1)
motion
to
dismiss
was
properly
sustained.
we
submit
further
that
there
are
other
reasons
on
which
looking
only
at
governor
rhodes’
particular
situation
one
must
conclude
reasonably
from
the
allegations
of
the
complaints
that
there
were
substantial
intervening
causes,
if
anything,
in
connection
with
governor
rhodes’
proclamation
cause
the
death
of
these
unfortunate
people.
there
were
intelligent
intervening
substantial
forces
which
intervened
between
the
proclamation
which
is
all
that
is
actually
shown
to
have
been
promulgated
by
governor
rhodes.
therefore,
on
other
grounds,
the
motion
to
dismiss
would
properly
have
been
sustained.
i
submit
also
that
the
question
of
whether
a
state
employee,
if
a
national
guard
can
be
an
employee
or
a
state
officer,
whether
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
applies
and
in
this
instance,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
authority
for
applying
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
so
as
to
bring
governor
rhodes
within
the
ambit
of
a
proper
action
against
him
in
these
cases.
and
for
all
of
those
reasons
and
for
the
reasons,
my
brother,
mr.
brown
has
set
forth,
i
would
say
that
governor
rhodes
is
in
a
fortiori
situation
with
respect
to
all
of
the
defendants.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
only
seven
defendants
in
this
case.
there
are,
as
mr.
sindell
refers
to
them,
the
trigger
man,
there
are
no
persons
alleged
to
have
been
trigger
man
in
these
instances.
and
those
must
be
taken
as
admissions
in
the
briefs
and
as
judicial
admissions
that
there
are
no
persons
who
are
so
charged
in
this
case.
so,
with
respect
to
governor
rhodes,
any
liability
which
applies
to
him
must
be
on
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
which
we
suggest
is
clearly
not
applicable.
i
have
nothing
--
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
would
say
if
the
arming
of
the
national
guard
is
in
and
of
itself
an
act
on
his
or
is
a
culpable
act,
yes
just
as
he
is
personally
charged
with
having
issued
the
proclamation
which
called
out
the
guard.
yes,
he
is,
if
that
is
a
culpable
act,
he
is
culpable.
i
submit
that
neither
of
those
acts
is
one
on
which
culpability
can
arise
because
the
training
of
the
guard
is
and
this
is
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
and
is
in
the
record,
that
the
training
of
the
guard
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
united
states
government
and
was
at
that
time.
the
training
of
the
guard
was
a
responsibility
of
the
united
states
military
officers
and
the
duty,
the
constitutional
and
statutory
duty
of
governor
rhodes
was
to
call
out
the
guard
and
the
arming
of
the
guard
and
the
actions
of
the
guard
were
the
responsibility
of
the
individuals
and
of
any
commanding
officers
who
issued
commands.
i
would
submit
that
the
act
of
calling
out
an
armed
guard
is
the
risk
that
one
takes
anytime
a
national
guard
unit
is
called
out.
it
is
within
the
realm
of
possibility
that
in
the
discretion
of
officers
having
discretion,
there
may
be
live
ammunition
used.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
yes.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
think
i
should
place
the
emphasis
on
the
words
well-pleaded.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
yes,
it
is
certainly
an
accepted
proposition,
yes.
and
i
would
place
strong
emphasis
on
the
matter
of
the
words
well-pleaded
because
i
would
submit
that
this
court
should
not
approve
retrospectively
or
prospectively
the
irresponsible
use
of
inflammatory
language
in
pleadings,
and
therefore,
then
take
the
allegations
as
true.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
plus,
if
your
honor
please,
matters
of
which
the
court
can
properly
take
judicial
notice
and
the
only
fact
which
i’m
suggesting
--
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
one
exception
to
the
rule
would
certainly
be
the
situation
of
the
campuses
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
in
the,
over
the
country
generally
in
may
of
1970.
and
that
there
were
at
those
times
riotous
situations
where
unusual
measures
had
to
be
taken.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
if
the
court
did
commit
error
in
respect
of
its
statements,
nevertheless,
the
judgment
of
the
court
taking
the
narrowest
construction
of
any
judicial
notice
which
it
had
a
right
to
take
was
sufficient
on
which
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
for
instance,
the
proclamation
of
governor
rhodes
is
a
document
of
which
judicial
notice
could
and
should
properly
have
been
taken
judicial
notice.
and
that
the
facts
well-pleaded
plus
properly
judicially
noticed
facts
are
sufficient.
now,
i
would
suggest,
for
instance,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
we’re
going
to
take
facts
well-pleaded
and
let’s
say
that
we
have
to
allege
in
order
to
plead
a
cause
of
action
that
there
were
no
roving
bands
of
men
bent
upon
destruction
of
property
and
endangering
life,
that
allegation
might
have
been
made,
but
it
was
not
made.
that
would
not
have
been
a
conclusion.
that
would
have
been
a
statement
of
fact.
i
would
submit
that
it’s
a
conclusion
that
the
plaintiff’s
attorney
could
not
in
good
conscience
have
made,
but
it
would
be
a
statement
of
fact
that
would
be
one.
if
we
would
take
for
instance
a
statement
that
the
rotc
building
did
not
burn
down
the
night
before
in
the
city
of
kent,
that
would
be
an
allegation
of
fact.
it
would
not
be
an
allegation
which
the
plaintiff
could
in
good
conscience
make,
but
it
would
be
an
allegation
of
fact
which
would
support
the
complaint
beyond
the
support
that
it
needs,
beyond
the
support
which
it
does
not
have.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
would
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
generally
disorderly
conditions
in
the
area
of
kent,
ohio
including
the
kent
university
campus.
therefore,
we
are
in
the
situation
where
sterling
versus
constantin
applies
to
make
the
action
of
the
governor
of
ohio
not
reviewable.
if
not
being
reviewable,
i
would
say
further
that
the
natural
consequences
of
his
act
are
also
not
reviewable
under
the
doctrine
of
executive
immunity.
under
that,
the
court
had
sufficient
before
it
to
make
those
determinations
of
fact
in
a
general
way.
whether
or
not
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
specific
fact
of
the
burning
of
the
rotc
building,
i
would
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
could.
that
was
a
widely-known
fact,
that
was
perhaps
almost
as
widely-known
effect,
certainly
as
widely-known
in
the
midwest
area
as
the
killing
of
donald
or
lee
harvey
oswald
by
jack
ruby.
the
burning
of
the
rotc
building
was
a
notorious
event
viewed
by
millions
of
people.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
would
say
that
the
court
might
do
so,
although
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
for
the
court
to
do
that
because
insurrection
is
not
a
sine
qua
non
of
the
proper
exercise
of
the
discretionary
power
of
the
governor
to
call
out
the
guard.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
it
is
a
--
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
it
is
a
very
complicated
term.
i
don’t
think
it
is
a
term
which
we
necessarily
must
find
in
order
to
find
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
district
court.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i’m
sorry.
i
don’t
believe
i
follow
that.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
yes.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
will
have
to
confess
to
you,
i
have
not
thought
about
it
and
i
think
that
i
would
say,
probably
not.
that
your
honor
has
just
said
that
the
term
insurrection
is
a
very
complicated
term
which
is
widely
embracing
and
has
many
legal
consequences.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
it
is
a
legal
conclusion
and
not
a
fact,
that’s
correct.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
well,
we
have
the
governor’s
proclamation,
but
we
have
some
specific
facts
in
the
governor’s
proclamation
that
in
the
territory
of
northeastern
ohio,
there
were
roving
bands
of
men
who
were
committing
acts
of
violence.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
i
think
the
court
can
take
that
as
true.
it
is
a
fact.
it
is
a
fact
as
distinguished
from
a
conclusion.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
again,
i
respectfully
--
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
--
emphasize
the
words
well-pleaded
and
i
submit
that
if
the
court
will
examine
each
complaint,
it
will
find
that
the
“facts”
are
conclusions.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
yes.
mr.
r.
brooke
alloway
that’s
true.
i
have
nothing
further.
