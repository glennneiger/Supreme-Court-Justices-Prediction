justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
the
statute
where
you
would
think
that
(inaudible)
1983
as
an
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
alleged
in
the
complaint
intentional
wrong,
but
certainly
you
think
that
that
would
state
a
cause
of
action.
how
much
further
would
you
say
would
the
section
reach?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say,
it
was
not
--
if
it
were
reasonable
for
a
person
to
understand
that
a
certain
act
did
not
violate
the
law,
he
hasn’t
been
negligent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
doesn’t
depend
on
how
it
final
it
turns
out
whether
it
violated
the
law
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
would
require
at
least
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
(inaudible)
to
say
state
eventually,
locally
wants
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
afterwards
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
supposedly
concluding
that
he
was
malicious
(inaudible)
running
for
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven’t
stated
maliciously.
justice
byron
r.
white
mostly
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
tend
to
believe
this
regard
to
malice.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
any
more
so
though
than
sterling
in
the
sterling
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
you
think
that
the
federal
court
in
this
case
would
have
jurisdiction
if
there
has
been
indication
that
the
defendant's
violated
constitutional
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
distinction
you
assert?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
inquire
for
a
moment.
let’s
assume
it
is
alleged
that
the
state
officials,
this
is
with
respect
to
immunity,
it
is
alleged
that
the
state
officials
acted
deliberately
and
knowingly
to
violate
a
constitutional
right
in
the
sense
that
they
intended
to
deprive
somebody
of
his
constitutional
rights.
and
let’s
assume
that
it’s
proved
and
everybody
concedes
that
they
knew
they
were
and
they
did
it
deliberately.
would
you
still
insist
on
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
say
you
would
submit
that
kind
of
--
those
kinds
of
allegations
is
to
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
permit
a
court
to
see
if
the
plaintiff
could
prove
those
kinds
of
allegations
against
the
state
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
here’s
the
--
how
--
here’s
the
complaint,
let’s
assume,
that
says
that
the
official
has
deliberately
and
knowingly
deprived
the
person,
and
intentionally
deprived
the
person
of
his
constitutional
rights.
that’s
the
allegation,
they
want
an
opportunity
to
prove
it.
now,
would
your
claim
of
immunity
stops
that
suit
in
its
tracks
before
it
ever
got
started.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i’d
say
all
you
have
is
the
allegation
and
the
complaint.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
would
say
dismiss
the
case
without
any
opportunity
to
prove
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
what
facts
existed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
that
they
are
well
pleaded
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
the
--
you
would
insist
on
immunity
even
though
it
is
alleged
and
somebody
stands
ready
to
prove
--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
immunity
claim
would
not
stop
that
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn’t
--
i
don’t
suppose
you
would
suggest
that
the
state
officials
would
be
immune
from
criminal
prosecution
under
a
federal
criminal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
242
that
speaks
about
conspiracy
to
deprive
people
of
their
constitutional
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
law
--
if
the
same
allegations
were
made
in
the
civil
suit,
that
would
have
to
be
proved
to
prove
a
criminal
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
the
immunity
would
apply
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
civil
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
just
because
the
very
same
allegations
in
the
civil
action
are
made
that
the
state
would
have
to
prove
in
the
criminal
case
or
if
the
government
would
have
to
prove
in
a
criminal
case
to
succeed.
do
you
say
that
criminal
--
there
would
be
no
immunity
in
the
criminal
suit,
but
there
would
be
in
the
civil
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
sort
of
whether
or
not
a
compliant
would
state
a
cause
of
action
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
rather
than
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that’s
the
way
you
read
it,
the
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
the
statute
where
you
would
think
that
(inaudible)

justice

i

how
