mr.
sindell,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
far
you
can
go
away
from
this
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’ve
been
talking
about
15
minutes,
you’ve
gone
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
have
to
try
you,
do
i?
i
don’t
have
to
follow
you
outside
directly
to
keep
that,
do
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
could
the
court
take
judicial
notice
that
there
was
“insurrection”
on
the
campus
in
kent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
point
is,
is
it
outside
of
the
judicial
notice?
you
take
judicial
notice
that
kent
university
there
or
it
has
18
buildings,
but
insurrection
is
a
rather
complicated
legal
term
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
which
is
the
basis
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
all
of
the
other
terms
that
are
on
the
governor’s
proclamation,
can
the
court
take
judicial
notice
that
they
are
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn’t
the
proclamation
say
there
is
insurrection
and
this
and
that
in
the
governor’s
proclamation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
the
court
take
judicial
notice
of
those
statements,
are
facts
that
are
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
way,
you
got
positive
allegations
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
side,
all
you
have
is
the
governor’s
proclamation,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
the
court
take
that
as
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
whatever
the
governor
says
is
a
fact
but
whatever
the
petitioner
say
is
not,
where
to
the
contrary
the
rule
say
that
you
must
accept
all
well-pleaded
facts
in
one
paper.
it
does
say
any,
about
that
other
paper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
the
court
will
(inaudible)
you
would
only
taken
well-pleaded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
one
of
those
three
cases,
strutter,
one
of
them
--
wasn’t
that
a
judge
involved
in
that
case,
wasn’t
it
ex
parte
of
strutter
or
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
one
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
the
judge
was
involved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
apply
to
the
federal
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
both
were
enacted
at
the
same
time,
weren’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
--
well,
what
justification
do
you
have
for
taking
the
criminal
and
not
the
civil?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you’re
telling
me
that
congress
meant
to
apply
this
criminally,
but
not
civilly,
is
that
what
you’re
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
were
passed
in
the
same
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
were
passed
in
the
same
batch
is
passed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
telling
me
that
congress
said
that
you
are
criminally
liable,
but
not
civilly
liable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
in
the
world
do
you
have
to
back
that
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
the
debate?
of
course,
it’s
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
have
now
interpreting
this
statute,
the
1871
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
say
that
this
man
can
go
to
jail,
but
he
can’t
be
subject
to
an
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
either
way
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
saying
he
can
go
to
jail
for
five
years,
but
he
can’t
be
sued
for
$2
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are?
justice
thurgood
marshall
barr
and
matteo
wouldn’t
bar
an
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
barr
and
matteo
would
not
bar
the
injunction
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
action
of
an
executive
officer
of
a
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
why
wouldn’t
it
be
a
flood
of
lawsuits,
the
same
floods
you’re
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
if
there
is
a
possibility
of
an
action
for
damages,
there
will
be
a
flood
of
lawsuits.
you
now
say
there’s
a
possibility
of
an
action
for
injunction.
my
question
is
why
wouldn’t
it
be
just
as
much
of
a
flood
of
lawsuits?
justice
thurgood
marshall
some
of
these
are
not
elected
officials?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
