mr.
michael
e.
geltner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
plaintiffs’
decedent,
sandra
scheuer,
was
killed
by
a
national
guardsman’s
bullet
on
kent
state
university
campus
in
1970.
thereafter,
the
plaintiffs
brought
an
action
in
federal
court
alleging
a
deprivation
of
civil
rights
under
section
1983,
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1971,
specifically
detailing
the
alleged
conduct
and
misconduct
of
the
defendants
charged.
the
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
while
the
action
was
in
form
against
the
defendants
individually,
in
fact,
it
affected
the
state
of
ohio,
therefore,
it
was
a
suit
against
the
state
of
ohio
and
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
appeal
was
taken
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
a
divided
opinion,
a
panel
of
the
circuit
affirmed
again
on
the
eleventh
amendment
ground.
judge
white,
in
writing
his
majority
opinion,
went
beyond
the
eleventh
amendment
ground
and
concluded
that
he
reached
the
same
result
under
the
doctrine
of
executive
immunity
which
he
held
covered
the
field
in
actions
arising
under
the
civil
rights
act.
so,
we’re
here
without
a
record.
we’re
here
with
a
complaint
and
motions,
and
here
on
a
theory
which
is
heretofore
had
not
been
applied
to
actions
charging
individuals
with
misconduct
under
the
civil
rights
act
or
against
any
other
jurisdictional
basis
which
would
otherwise
lodge
jurisdiction
in
the
court.
as
to
the
first
issue,
the
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
issue
so-called,
the
novelty
to
the
issue
is
mentioned
in
my
brief.
it
has
been
our
position
throughout
the
litigation
that
this
ground
was
repudiated
long
ago,
it’s
inconsistent
without
basic
notion
of
federalism.
the
fourteenth
amendment
can
be
made
to
co-exist
with
the
eleventh
amendment
only
insofar
as
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
is
and
remains
viable
and
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
applies
a
fortiori
in
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiffs
seeks
damages
against
an
individual
and
charges
the
individual
for
misconduct.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
understand
your
honor’s
dissenting
opinion
in
the
employees
of
the
department
of
mental
health
in
the
state
of
missouri
versus
the
department
of
missouri.
i
certainly
am
willing
to
take
advantage
of
that
position.
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
to
reach
out
for
that
proposition
to
decide
this
case
on
that
issue.
in
point
of
fact,
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
an
action
against
an
individual,
an
individual
who
--
or
here
individuals,
who
are
governmental
officers,
which
doesn’t
seek
in
any
way
to
get
at
the
state
treasury
or
at
public
property,
is
an
action
which
falls
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
therefore,
i
didn’t
feel
it
was
necessary
to
reach
out
for
what
you
refer
to
in
your
opinion
about
it.
the
missouri
case,
which
is
the
most
recent
decision
of
the
court
on
point,
it
seems
to
me,
pins
down
quite
clearly
that
there
has
been
no
sentiment
in
this
court
for
the
proposition
that
the
eleventh
amendment
could
conceivably
reach
the
case
such
as
this
one.
the
majority
opinion
of
justice
douglas
makes
it
quite
clear
that
if
the
congress,
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
were
to
attempt
to
lodge
jurisdiction
even
against
the
state,
if
it
were
acting
validly
within
a
grant
of
legislative
power,
could
do
so.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
for
--
himself
and
justice
stewart
specifically
exempts
actions
against
individual
officers
from
the
thrust
of
his
opinion
which
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
jurisdictional
limitation,
in
effect,
a
gloss
on
article
iii.
so
that,
it’s
quite
clear
to
me
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
what
the
district
court
did
was
simply
express
its
hostility
to
the
plaintiffs’
view
of
the
case
by
going
out
on
a
grant
of
decision
which
is
totally
unsupported
by
precedents
of
this
court,
excuse
me.
so,
we
get
to
what
i
believe
is
the
heart
of
the
case
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
executive
immunity,
so-called
or
sometimes
called
a
governmental
or
official
immunity,
attaches
in
suits
arising
under
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
specifically
whether
or
not
a
governmental
official
can
say
“i’m
immune
from
suit”
and,
therefore,
though
the
plaintiff
has
charged
him
specifically
with
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
nevertheless,
because
of
one’s
position,
one
may
not
be
sued.
the
precise
issue
has
not
been
adjudicated
before
in
this
court.
we
have
barr
versus
matteo
which
is
a
defamation
case
arising
under
the
district
of
columbia
in
which
the
court
framed
what
i
view
as
a
federal
common
law
defense
to
a
state
tort
action.
barr
versus
matteo,
for
the
reason
summarized
in
our
brief,
does
not
really
cover
the
ground
here.
we
don’t
have
a
libel
action
here.
i
express
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
same
result
would
be
reached
in
barr
versus
matteo
on
the
basis
of
the
law
of
defamation
as
it
now
stands
after
the
court’s
opinions
leading
up
to
rosenbloom,
but
i
think
it’s
pretty
clear
that
barr
versus
matteo
does
not
cover
this
case.
the
only
expression
of
judicial
opinion
in
this
court
of
significance
on
the
immunity
question
here
is
justice
harlan’s
concurring
opinion
in
the
bevins
case.
if
you
may
remember,
the
bevins
case
presented
both
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
cause
of
action
arising
under
the
fourth
amendment
and,
likewise,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
defendants
were
immune
from
suit
assuming
there
was
a
cause
of
action.
justice
brennan’s
opinion
for
the
majority
did
not
reach
that
second
question
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
reached
it.
justice
harlan
noted
at
the
end
of
his
long
concurring
opinion
that
it
was
not
appropriate
or
necessary
for
him
to
decide
the
question,
but
he
believed
that
it
was
appropriate
to
venture
the
opinion
that,
for
the
most
flagrant
examples
of
governmental
abuse
of
power,
there
would
certainly
be
a
right
to
redress.
that
is
essentially
the
basis
of
the
claim
asserted
by
these
--
by
the
plaintiffs
of
this
case.
the
issue
has
been
spoken
to
by
many
courts
of
appeals.
by
and
large,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
distinguished
actions
arising
under
the
civil
rights
act
from
state
tort
actions
have
noted,
as
did
justice
harlan,
that
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right
is
significantly
more
serious
than
a
tort
arising
under
state
law.
for
that
reason,
they
concluded
that,
irrespective
of
the
state
rule
of
immunity
which
might
be
applicable,
it
was
clear
to
those
courts
that
there
was
no
such
executive
immunity
under
the
civil
rights
act.
this
conclusion,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
appropriate
one.
it
certainly
fits
the
intention
of
the
congress.
the
congress
of
1871
perceived
the
problem
before
as
essentially
a
problem
of
violence
and
saw
the
problem
that
was
sought
to
be
raised
by
both
sections
1
and
sections
2
of
that
act
as
governmental
and
non-governmental
violence.
the
non-governmental
violence
being
essentially
covered
by
section
2
of
the
act
which
is
presently
section
1985,
and
the
governmental
violence
being
covered
primarily
by
section
1
of
the
act,
that
is,
this
is
an
appropriate
case
fitting
within
the
precise
legislative
intention
of
the
congress.
the
congress’
intention
was
recently
summarized
for
the
court
in
justice
brennan’s
opinion
in
district
of
columbia
versus
carter.
it
certainly
supports
that
conclusion
that
that
is
what
congress
is
concerned
with.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
discuss
moyer
versus
peabody
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
moyer
versus
--
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
it
is
discussed,
i
believe
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
in
the
main
brief.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
there
are
two
relatively
long
briefs.
there’s
a
main
brief
and
a
reply
brief.
we
see
moyer
versus
peabody,
first
of
all,
as
being
substantially
limited
by
the
court’s
opinion
in
sterling
versus
constantin.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
moyer
versus
peabody
makes
an
expression
that
the
government
of
the
state
can
do
whatever
the
governor
of
the
state
believes
is
appropriate
to
do,
it
is
both
overruled
by
sterling
versus
constantin
and,
furthermore,
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
thrust
of
this
court’s
decision
preceding
it
as
specifically
inconsistent
with
ex
parte
milligan
which
was
decided
the
year
congress
passed
the
statute.
the
sole
question
that
seems,
as
to
the
legislative
intention,
is
what
that
congress
intended.
it’s
inconceivable
that
that
congress
with
its
view
point
could
have
intended
an
immunity
of
this
kind
for
a
state
governor
in
view
of
the
fact
that
state
law
enforcement
was
primarily
what
the
congress
was
attempting
to
reach
with
both
section
1
and
section
2.
and
so,
we
get
to
the
prevailing
history
and
it
is
pretty
clear
that,
unlike
the
legislative
history
--
legislative
immunity
which
was
recognized
in
1871
both
by
the
federal
constitution
and
by
parallel
state
constitutions,
and
unlike
the
law
extending
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity,
there
is
no
substantial
support
for
the
view
of
executive
immunity
at
the
time
that
this
congress
acted.
congress
simply
must
have
seen
it
as
an
appropriate
purpose
to
reach
governmental
misuse
of
force
and
there
is
no
basis
to
believe
from
the
debates
that
congress
intended
to
carve
out
any
individuals
as
immune
from
the
reach
of
its
legislative
power.
now
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
ex
parte
virginia.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor,
ex
parte
virginia.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
we
distinguish
clearly
judicial
immunity
here
from
executive
immunity.
as
i
mentioned
in
my
brief,
the
legislative
history
to
my
mind
does
not
even
support
judicial
immunity.
i
reckon
that
we’ve
got
pierson
in
this
court
and
bradley
versus
fisher
at
that
time
to
cope
with,
this
is
clearly
a
different
issue.
now,
it
is
in
fact
true
that
many
states
now
have
a
doctrine
of
executive
immunity
for
state
torts
and
similar
actions.
it’s
likewise
true
that
this
court
has
recognized
such
an
immunity
in
barr
versus
matteo
with
respect
to
a
parallel
issue,
namely
state
libel
actions,
involving
federal
officials.
they
don’t
cover
this
issue
and
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
implication
in
any
of
these
opinions
that
it
is
appropriate
to
distinguish
for
immunity
purposes
between
ministerial
officials
and
so-called
officials
exercising
discretionary
functions,
we
believe
that
any
such
distinction
is
basically
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
inconsistent
with
logic.
there
is,
for
example,
in
the
remand
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
bevins
case
an
suggestion
that
while
the
particular
parties
before
the
court,
they
are
federal
narcotics
bureau
agents,
were
not
immune,
possibly
the
director
of
the
federal
narcotics
bureau
or
somebody
else
who
made
basically
discretionary
decisions
would
be
immune
from
suit.
now,
the
distinction
has
never
been
applied
in
civil
rights
act
cases.
in
tort
cases,
the
distinction
has
always
been
a
distinction
based
upon
the
immunability
of
lower
level
officials
to
mandamus
where
there
is
a
positive
declaration
by
law
that
they
must
do
an
act.
so,
for
example,
a
court
clerk
might
be
subject
to
mandamus
to
compel
the
court
clerk
to
give
a
copy
of
the
document
to
somebody.
similarly,
those
courts
have
said
where
refusal
to
engage
in
an
act,
which
could
be
compelled
to
a
mandamus,
could
be
a
basis
for
liability.
but
those
courts
have
also
said
a
discretionary
act,
that
is
one
not
subject
to
mandamus,
might
be
immune
from
suit.
now,
to
hold
that
as
to
the
civil
rights
act
seems
anomalous.
we
might,
for
example,
have
a
situation
in
which
a
senior
police
official
orders
a
policeman
to
engage
in
an
unconstitutional
act
and
the
situation
in
which
the
person
who
commits
the
act,
who
had
no
basic
decision
making
power,
is
left
holding
the
bag
while
the
officer
who
made
the
decision
to
engage
in
the
constitutional
deprivation
is,
in
fact,
immune.
that
seems
senseless
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
was
clearly
the
purpose
of
the
congress
to
reach
both.
in
addition,
there
doesn’t
seem
any
sensible
basis
to
close
the
doors
of
the
court
with
respect
to
that
sort
of
act.
the
distinction
between
ministerial
and
discretionary
acts,
when
one
clearly
looks
at
it,
breaks
down.
in
fact,
at
all
levels
of
government,
at
least
when
we’re
dealing
with
the
question
of
use
of
governmental
force,
discretion
is
exercised,
so
that
at
both
levels,
the
concept
of
a
ministerial
discretionary
distinction
breaks
down
as
being
basically
inconsistent
with
the
policies
sought
to
be
served,
excuse
me,
by
the
congress.
so,
what
we’re
left
with
then
is
the
bare
claim
that
if
officials
are
subject
to
suit,
it
will
be
troublesome
for
them.
they
are
too
important
to
be
called
into
court.
they’ll
have
to
spend
time.
they’ll
have
to
spend
money.
they
might
be
intimidated.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
where
the
congress
has
declared
a
specific
policy,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
prevent
certain
kinds
of
wrong,
it
is
precisely
then
that
the
intimidation
should
attach.
and,
in
fact,
the
threat
of
liability
is
the
way
in
which
the
congress
attempted
to
achieve
its
result
in
1871,
preventing
the
misuse
of
governmental
force
on
individuals.
your
honor,
i
requested
that
i
reserve
10
minutes,
and
i
believe
my
20
minutes
is
up,
so
that
if
there
are
no
further
questions
now,
i’d
like
to
reserve
rebuttal
time.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
moyer
was
and,
your
honor,
if
i
could
mention,
the
thing
about
moyer
is,
moyer
was
a
case
in
which
the
governor
of
colorado
concluded
that
there
was
an
insurrection.
as
a
consequence
of
his
conclusion
that
there
was
an
insurrection,
he
imprisoned
the
plaintiff
and
the
plaintiff
later
brought
an
action
charging
a
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right.
now,
the
thing
about
moyer
is
moyer
holds
that
the
governor’s
decision
of
insurrection
is
unreviewable.
that
part
of
moyer
is
clearly
overruled
by
sterling
versus
constantin.
the
dictum
in
justice
holmes’
opinion
in
moyer
to
the
effect
that
the
governor
could
do
more
than
imprison,
it
seems
to
me,
is
completely
out
of
consonance
with
our
traditions.
the
concept
is
basically
that
in
an
insurrection,
which
we
did
not
have
here,
in
an
insurrection
the
governor
could
do
whatever
he
pleases
to
put
down
the
insurrection.
in
fact,
in
ex
parte
milligan,
the
court
held
that
there
was
only
one
thing
that
an
insurrection
or
rebellion
change,
and
that
was
he
permitted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
be
suspended
during
the
continuation
of
the
insurrection.
we
don’t
have
either
of
those
issues
here.
we
don’t
have
an
insurrection.
we
don’t
have
here
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
writ
was
properly
suspended.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
view
that
talk
as
being
basically
connected
with
the
court’s
decision
on
the
cause
of
action.
that
is
all
that
i
see
there
and
i
think
that
the
opinion
bears
it
out.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
i
think
that
was
the
holding
of
the
case.
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
specifically
overruled
by
chief
justice
hughes’
opinion
in
sterling
versus
constantin,
the
specific
holding
of
the
un-reviewability
of
the
determination
of
the
existence
of
insurrection
and
so
what
we’re
left
with
as
to
moyer
is
the
dictum
that
justice
holmes
issued.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
sir.
well,
with
respect
--
i
read
that
dictum
as
being
related
to
the
power
of
the
governor
to
do
whatever
the
governor
feels
necessary.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
exactly
what
i
read.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
i
read
it
that
way.
i
read
the
case
--
i
read
both
cases
as
having
no
bearing
on
immunity,
but
having
bearing
on
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
our
position
is
we
rely
for
a
substantive
theory.
again,
going
to
the
cause
of
action
rather
than
immunity
issue,
we
rely
on
monroe
versus
pape
and
the
few
expressions
in
dictum
in
this
court’s
opinions
in
d.c.
versus
carter
and
in
moore
versus
alameda
county.
specific
intention
to
cause
injury
or
deprive
one
of
the
constitutional
right
is
a
prerequisite
to
establishing
criminal
liability
under
section
18
us
code,
section
241
which
is
the
criminal
analogue
of
section
1983.
in
monroe,
the
court
specifically
dealt
with
the
distinction
on
how
that
specific
intention
is
not
necessary,
rather,
section
1983
was
to
be
interpreted
in
line
with
the
intention
of
congress
to
reach
governmental
misuse
of
force
and
with
the
preexisting
body
of
tort
law
which
founded
liability
on
fault.
so
that,
the
only
question
that
relates
to
the
viability
of
the
cause
of
action
is
whether
or
not
we
have
alleged
and
proved
fault
on
the
part
of
the
individual
defendants
which
fault
lead
to
the
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right,
in
this
case,
the
right
not
to
kill.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i’m
using
fault
in
the
sense
of
either
wrongful
intention,
recklessness,
wanton
and
willful
misconduct,
or
negligence.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
mere
negligence.
now,
as
to
mere
negligence,
this
court
has
not
passed
directly
on
that
issue.
the
weight
of
authority
in
the
circuit
courts
is
that
mere
negligence
when
tied
to
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right,
for
example
negligence
leading
to
a
misuse
of
weapons
by
governmental
troops,
states
a
claim
under
section
1983.
and,
in
my
brief,
i’ve
cited
the
case
on
which
you
rely
for
that
proposition.
i
believe
monroe
versus
walter
(ph).
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
there
again,
judge
seligricci's
dissent
didn’t
have
to
reach
out
to
the
question
of
the
cause
of
action.
we
have
alleged,
and
i
believe
we
can
prove,
although
we
have
no
record
before
us,
that
what
we
allege.
we
have
alleged
intentional
conduct.
we’ve
alleged
recklessness
and,
we’ve
alleged
wanton
and
willful
misconduct.
we
believe
that
this
point
is
not
incumbent
in
us
to
prove
it.
we
can’t
prove
that
before
this
court.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
we
are
not
claiming
the
liability
of
the
governor
flows
from
the
fact
that
the
government
called
out
the
guard,
that
is
not
the
basis
for
liability
in
this
case.
we
have
alleged
with
great
specificity
what
we
rely
on.
we
rely
on
orders.
we
rely
on
the
rules
of
engagement
which
existed
at
the
time
in
the
ohio
national
guard
which
the
governor
knew
about,
specifically
the
orders
to
carry
loaded
weapons,
the
orders
to
march
head
on
with
bayonets
out
into
a
crowd.
these
are
matters
of
record
as
a
consequence
of
gilligan
versus
morgan
and,
we
rely
on
them.
we
do
not
rely
on
the
mere
act
of
calling
out
the
guard.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
didn’t
mean
to
say
that.
we’re
not
claiming
negligence
in
calling
out
the
guard.
we’re
claiming
negligence
in
the
way
in
which
the
guard
is
supervised,
in
the
way
in
which
the
governor
acts
himself,
at
the
scene.
those
are
the
things
that
we’re
relying
upon.
we
don’t
have
to
reach
out
for
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
guard
was
negligently
called
out
here.
now,
your
honors
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
now,
we
are
claiming
that
the
constitution
protects
one
from
being
killed
or
injured
by
the
use
of
governmental
force
without
due
process
of
law
and
by
due
process
of
law,
we
simply
mean
a
hearing.
the
government
to
the
extent
that
the
governments
can
injure
one
or
can
kill
one,
it
can
only
do
so
insofar
as
it
acts
legitimately
in
defense
of
appropriate
interests
or
it
does
so
through
the
criminal
process.
now,
we
rely
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
rely
primarily
on
the
screws
case.
i
rely
very
heavily
on
the
legislative
history.
this
is
precisely
what
the
1871
congress
was
concerned
with.
the
civil
rights
act
has
reached
out
to
cover
many
areas.
the
core
of
the
congress
is
concerned
with
killings
and
beatings.
we
rely
on
screws
which
holds
that
specifically.
i
rely
on
the
dictum
in
district
of
columbia
versus
carter
and
we
rely
on
a
long
line
of
circuit
court
opinions
which
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
use
of
governmental
force
outside
of
the
criminal
process
is
a
violation
of
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
the
latest
opinion
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
which
explores
the
area
most
carefully,
is
chief
judge
friendly’s
opinion
in
johnson
versus
glick.
we
rely
on
that
case
and
the
cases
it
cites.
now
if
could,
we
have
heard
a
lot
in
this
case
about
the
facts.
it
has
been
my
feeling
all
along,
as
expressed
by
the
opinion
of
the
courts
below,
that
somehow
they
read
the
newspapers
and
took
judicial
notice
of
the
conclusion
that
everything
the
guard
did
was
proper
and
that
there
was
an
insurrection
or
something
close
to
it.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
are
no
affidavits
in
this
case.
there
are
no
such
facts.
the
affidavits
were
filed
in
the
krauss
case.
these
cases
have
not
been
consolidated.
but,
in
either
case,
what
we
have
here
is
a
complaint
that
they’re
more
than
complaints
and
the
newspapers
and
the
opinions
that
the
judges
garnished
from
the
newspapers
below
don’t
seem
to
be
to
have
any
bearing
on
the
way
in
which
the
precise
legal
issues
ought
to
be
decided
here
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
documents
in
existence
which
has
any
bearing
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
it
is
the
stratton
commission
report
which
is
not
in
the
record,
it
is
the
only
doctrine
of
which,
under
the
rules
of
evidence,
the
court
at
this
point
should
take
judicial
notice.
i
did
not
propose
the
stratton
commission
report
as
a
finding
effect.
if
this
--
but,
if
the
court
feels
some
necessity
to
go
beyond
the
pleadings,
that
is
the
only
finding
of
the
governmental
agency
which
has
dealt
with
the
subject
matter.
now,
there
--
we’ve
been
hearing
throughout
the
case
the
view
that
this
immunity
is
necessary
because,
in
the
absence
of
immunity,
the
court’s
opinion
flooded
with
complaints
these
complaints
are
all
going
to
be
frivolous
and
as
a
result
of
only
these
frivolous
complaints,
the
government
is
going
to
stop.
people
are
just
going
to
stop
acting.
it
is
not
a
description
of
this
case.
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
federal
district
court
should
not
be
presumed
to
be
filing
frivolous
paper.
he
signs,
rule
11
requires
the
complaint
to
be
signed.
he’s
subject
to
disbarment
for
filing
frivolous
complaints.
and
finally,
the
argument,
when
you
analyze
it,
supposedly
comes
down
to
the
old
argument
that
if
you
permit
this
kind
of
suit,
the
courts
are
going
to
be
flooded.
that
is
precisely
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
bevins
case.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
understand
the
distinction,
but
underlying
it
is
the
view
that
the
courts
will
be
flooded
by
complaints
of
this
kind,
which,
flooding
will
then
result
in
lawsuit
judicial
time,
lawsuit
attorney’s
time,
lawsuit
official
time
and
intimidation.
in
substance
it's
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
the
bevins
case.
it’s
the
same
argument
that
was
rejected.
and
further,
it
requires
this
court
to
make
basically
a
legislative
finding
of
fact
and
i
think
the
congress
has
made
that
finding
of
fact.
congress
considered
these
issues
when
congress
acted.
and
at
this
point,
the
court,
in
order
to
reverse
the
congressional
decision,
would
in
effect
be
making
a
legislative
act
in
a
face
of
another
legislative
act
without
any
empirical
basis
to
support
it.
so,
i
think
that
all
of
those
theories
are
just
untenable
as
a
basis
for
either
the
eleventh
amendment
ground
or
the
executive
immunity
ground.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
plaintiffs’
decedent,
sandra
scheuer,
was
killed
by
a
national
guardsman’s
bullet
on
kent
state
university
campus
in
1970.
thereafter,
the
plaintiffs
brought
an
action
in
federal
court
alleging
a
deprivation
of
civil
rights
under
section
1983,
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1971,
specifically
detailing
the
alleged
conduct
and
misconduct
of
the
defendants
charged.
the
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
while
the
action
was
in
form
against
the
defendants
individually,
in
fact,
it
affected
the
state
of
ohio,
therefore,
it
was
a
suit
against
the
state
of
ohio
and
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
appeal
was
taken
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
a
divided
opinion,
a
panel
of
the
circuit
affirmed
again
on
the
eleventh
amendment
ground.
judge
white,
in
writing
his
majority
opinion,
went
beyond
the
eleventh
amendment
ground
and
concluded
that
he
reached
the
same
result
under
the
doctrine
of
executive
immunity
which
he
held
covered
the
field
in
actions
arising
under
the
civil
rights
act.
so,
we’re
here
without
a
record.
we’re
here
with
a
complaint
and
motions,
and
here
on
a
theory
which
is
heretofore
had
not
been
applied
to
actions
charging
individuals
with
misconduct
under
the
civil
rights
act
or
against
any
other
jurisdictional
basis
which
would
otherwise
lodge
jurisdiction
in
the
court.
as
to
the
first
issue,
the
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
issue
so-called,
the
novelty
to
the
issue
is
mentioned
in
my
brief.
it
has
been
our
position
throughout
the
litigation
that
this
ground
was
repudiated
long
ago,
it’s
inconsistent
without
basic
notion
of
federalism.
the
fourteenth
amendment
can
be
made
to
co-exist
with
the
eleventh
amendment
only
insofar
as
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
is
and
remains
viable
and
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
applies
a
fortiori
in
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiffs
seeks
damages
against
an
individual
and
charges
the
individual
for
misconduct.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
understand
your
honor’s
dissenting
opinion
in
the
employees
of
the
department
of
mental
health
in
the
state
of
missouri
versus
the
department
of
missouri.
i
certainly
am
willing
to
take
advantage
of
that
position.
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
to
reach
out
for
that
proposition
to
decide
this
case
on
that
issue.
in
point
of
fact,
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
an
action
against
an
individual,
an
individual
who
--
or
here
individuals,
who
are
governmental
officers,
which
doesn’t
seek
in
any
way
to
get
at
the
state
treasury
or
at
public
property,
is
an
action
which
falls
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
therefore,
i
didn’t
feel
it
was
necessary
to
reach
out
for
what
you
refer
to
in
your
opinion
about
it.
the
missouri
case,
which
is
the
most
recent
decision
of
the
court
on
point,
it
seems
to
me,
pins
down
quite
clearly
that
there
has
been
no
sentiment
in
this
court
for
the
proposition
that
the
eleventh
amendment
could
conceivably
reach
the
case
such
as
this
one.
the
majority
opinion
of
justice
douglas
makes
it
quite
clear
that
if
the
congress,
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
were
to
attempt
to
lodge
jurisdiction
even
against
the
state,
if
it
were
acting
validly
within
a
grant
of
legislative
power,
could
do
so.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
for
--
himself
and
justice
stewart
specifically
exempts
actions
against
individual
officers
from
the
thrust
of
his
opinion
which
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
jurisdictional
limitation,
in
effect,
a
gloss
on
article
iii.
so
that,
it’s
quite
clear
to
me
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
what
the
district
court
did
was
simply
express
its
hostility
to
the
plaintiffs’
view
of
the
case
by
going
out
on
a
grant
of
decision
which
is
totally
unsupported
by
precedents
of
this
court,
excuse
me.
so,
we
get
to
what
i
believe
is
the
heart
of
the
case
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
executive
immunity,
so-called
or
sometimes
called
a
governmental
or
official
immunity,
attaches
in
suits
arising
under
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
specifically
whether
or
not
a
governmental
official
can
say
“i’m
immune
from
suit”
and,
therefore,
though
the
plaintiff
has
charged
him
specifically
with
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
nevertheless,
because
of
one’s
position,
one
may
not
be
sued.
the
precise
issue
has
not
been
adjudicated
before
in
this
court.
we
have
barr
versus
matteo
which
is
a
defamation
case
arising
under
the
district
of
columbia
in
which
the
court
framed
what
i
view
as
a
federal
common
law
defense
to
a
state
tort
action.
barr
versus
matteo,
for
the
reason
summarized
in
our
brief,
does
not
really
cover
the
ground
here.
we
don’t
have
a
libel
action
here.
i
express
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
same
result
would
be
reached
in
barr
versus
matteo
on
the
basis
of
the
law
of
defamation
as
it
now
stands
after
the
court’s
opinions
leading
up
to
rosenbloom,
but
i
think
it’s
pretty
clear
that
barr
versus
matteo
does
not
cover
this
case.
the
only
expression
of
judicial
opinion
in
this
court
of
significance
on
the
immunity
question
here
is
justice
harlan’s
concurring
opinion
in
the
bevins
case.
if
you
may
remember,
the
bevins
case
presented
both
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
cause
of
action
arising
under
the
fourth
amendment
and,
likewise,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
defendants
were
immune
from
suit
assuming
there
was
a
cause
of
action.
justice
brennan’s
opinion
for
the
majority
did
not
reach
that
second
question
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
reached
it.
justice
harlan
noted
at
the
end
of
his
long
concurring
opinion
that
it
was
not
appropriate
or
necessary
for
him
to
decide
the
question,
but
he
believed
that
it
was
appropriate
to
venture
the
opinion
that,
for
the
most
flagrant
examples
of
governmental
abuse
of
power,
there
would
certainly
be
a
right
to
redress.
that
is
essentially
the
basis
of
the
claim
asserted
by
these
--
by
the
plaintiffs
of
this
case.
the
issue
has
been
spoken
to
by
many
courts
of
appeals.
by
and
large,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
distinguished
actions
arising
under
the
civil
rights
act
from
state
tort
actions
have
noted,
as
did
justice
harlan,
that
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right
is
significantly
more
serious
than
a
tort
arising
under
state
law.
for
that
reason,
they
concluded
that,
irrespective
of
the
state
rule
of
immunity
which
might
be
applicable,
it
was
clear
to
those
courts
that
there
was
no
such
executive
immunity
under
the
civil
rights
act.
this
conclusion,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
appropriate
one.
it
certainly
fits
the
intention
of
the
congress.
the
congress
of
1871
perceived
the
problem
before
as
essentially
a
problem
of
violence
and
saw
the
problem
that
was
sought
to
be
raised
by
both
sections
1
and
sections
2
of
that
act
as
governmental
and
non-governmental
violence.
the
non-governmental
violence
being
essentially
covered
by
section
2
of
the
act
which
is
presently
section
1985,
and
the
governmental
violence
being
covered
primarily
by
section
1
of
the
act,
that
is,
this
is
an
appropriate
case
fitting
within
the
precise
legislative
intention
of
the
congress.
the
congress’
intention
was
recently
summarized
for
the
court
in
justice
brennan’s
opinion
in
district
of
columbia
versus
carter.
it
certainly
supports
that
conclusion
that
that
is
what
congress
is
concerned
with.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
discuss
moyer
versus
peabody
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
moyer
versus
--
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
it
is
discussed,
i
believe
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
in
the
main
brief.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
there
are
two
relatively
long
briefs.
there’s
a
main
brief
and
a
reply
brief.
we
see
moyer
versus
peabody,
first
of
all,
as
being
substantially
limited
by
the
court’s
opinion
in
sterling
versus
constantin.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
moyer
versus
peabody
makes
an
expression
that
the
government
of
the
state
can
do
whatever
the
governor
of
the
state
believes
is
appropriate
to
do,
it
is
both
overruled
by
sterling
versus
constantin
and,
furthermore,
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
thrust
of
this
court’s
decision
preceding
it
as
specifically
inconsistent
with
ex
parte
milligan
which
was
decided
the
year
congress
passed
the
statute.
the
sole
question
that
seems,
as
to
the
legislative
intention,
is
what
that
congress
intended.
it’s
inconceivable
that
that
congress
with
its
view
point
could
have
intended
an
immunity
of
this
kind
for
a
state
governor
in
view
of
the
fact
that
state
law
enforcement
was
primarily
what
the
congress
was
attempting
to
reach
with
both
section
1
and
section
2.
and
so,
we
get
to
the
prevailing
history
and
it
is
pretty
clear
that,
unlike
the
legislative
history
--
legislative
immunity
which
was
recognized
in
1871
both
by
the
federal
constitution
and
by
parallel
state
constitutions,
and
unlike
the
law
extending
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity,
there
is
no
substantial
support
for
the
view
of
executive
immunity
at
the
time
that
this
congress
acted.
congress
simply
must
have
seen
it
as
an
appropriate
purpose
to
reach
governmental
misuse
of
force
and
there
is
no
basis
to
believe
from
the
debates
that
congress
intended
to
carve
out
any
individuals
as
immune
from
the
reach
of
its
legislative
power.
now
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
ex
parte
virginia.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor,
ex
parte
virginia.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
we
distinguish
clearly
judicial
immunity
here
from
executive
immunity.
as
i
mentioned
in
my
brief,
the
legislative
history
to
my
mind
does
not
even
support
judicial
immunity.
i
reckon
that
we’ve
got
pierson
in
this
court
and
bradley
versus
fisher
at
that
time
to
cope
with,
this
is
clearly
a
different
issue.
now,
it
is
in
fact
true
that
many
states
now
have
a
doctrine
of
executive
immunity
for
state
torts
and
similar
actions.
it’s
likewise
true
that
this
court
has
recognized
such
an
immunity
in
barr
versus
matteo
with
respect
to
a
parallel
issue,
namely
state
libel
actions,
involving
federal
officials.
they
don’t
cover
this
issue
and
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
implication
in
any
of
these
opinions
that
it
is
appropriate
to
distinguish
for
immunity
purposes
between
ministerial
officials
and
so-called
officials
exercising
discretionary
functions,
we
believe
that
any
such
distinction
is
basically
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
inconsistent
with
logic.
there
is,
for
example,
in
the
remand
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
bevins
case
an
suggestion
that
while
the
particular
parties
before
the
court,
they
are
federal
narcotics
bureau
agents,
were
not
immune,
possibly
the
director
of
the
federal
narcotics
bureau
or
somebody
else
who
made
basically
discretionary
decisions
would
be
immune
from
suit.
now,
the
distinction
has
never
been
applied
in
civil
rights
act
cases.
in
tort
cases,
the
distinction
has
always
been
a
distinction
based
upon
the
immunability
of
lower
level
officials
to
mandamus
where
there
is
a
positive
declaration
by
law
that
they
must
do
an
act.
so,
for
example,
a
court
clerk
might
be
subject
to
mandamus
to
compel
the
court
clerk
to
give
a
copy
of
the
document
to
somebody.
similarly,
those
courts
have
said
where
refusal
to
engage
in
an
act,
which
could
be
compelled
to
a
mandamus,
could
be
a
basis
for
liability.
but
those
courts
have
also
said
a
discretionary
act,
that
is
one
not
subject
to
mandamus,
might
be
immune
from
suit.
now,
to
hold
that
as
to
the
civil
rights
act
seems
anomalous.
we
might,
for
example,
have
a
situation
in
which
a
senior
police
official
orders
a
policeman
to
engage
in
an
unconstitutional
act
and
the
situation
in
which
the
person
who
commits
the
act,
who
had
no
basic
decision
making
power,
is
left
holding
the
bag
while
the
officer
who
made
the
decision
to
engage
in
the
constitutional
deprivation
is,
in
fact,
immune.
that
seems
senseless
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
was
clearly
the
purpose
of
the
congress
to
reach
both.
in
addition,
there
doesn’t
seem
any
sensible
basis
to
close
the
doors
of
the
court
with
respect
to
that
sort
of
act.
the
distinction
between
ministerial
and
discretionary
acts,
when
one
clearly
looks
at
it,
breaks
down.
in
fact,
at
all
levels
of
government,
at
least
when
we’re
dealing
with
the
question
of
use
of
governmental
force,
discretion
is
exercised,
so
that
at
both
levels,
the
concept
of
a
ministerial
discretionary
distinction
breaks
down
as
being
basically
inconsistent
with
the
policies
sought
to
be
served,
excuse
me,
by
the
congress.
so,
what
we’re
left
with
then
is
the
bare
claim
that
if
officials
are
subject
to
suit,
it
will
be
troublesome
for
them.
they
are
too
important
to
be
called
into
court.
they’ll
have
to
spend
time.
they’ll
have
to
spend
money.
they
might
be
intimidated.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
where
the
congress
has
declared
a
specific
policy,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
prevent
certain
kinds
of
wrong,
it
is
precisely
then
that
the
intimidation
should
attach.
and,
in
fact,
the
threat
of
liability
is
the
way
in
which
the
congress
attempted
to
achieve
its
result
in
1871,
preventing
the
misuse
of
governmental
force
on
individuals.
your
honor,
i
requested
that
i
reserve
10
minutes,
and
i
believe
my
20
minutes
is
up,
so
that
if
there
are
no
further
questions
now,
i’d
like
to
reserve
rebuttal
time.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
moyer
was
and,
your
honor,
if
i
could
mention,
the
thing
about
moyer
is,
moyer
was
a
case
in
which
the
governor
of
colorado
concluded
that
there
was
an
insurrection.
as
a
consequence
of
his
conclusion
that
there
was
an
insurrection,
he
imprisoned
the
plaintiff
and
the
plaintiff
later
brought
an
action
charging
a
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right.
now,
the
thing
about
moyer
is
moyer
holds
that
the
governor’s
decision
of
insurrection
is
unreviewable.
that
part
of
moyer
is
clearly
overruled
by
sterling
versus
constantin.
the
dictum
in
justice
holmes’
opinion
in
moyer
to
the
effect
that
the
governor
could
do
more
than
imprison,
it
seems
to
me,
is
completely
out
of
consonance
with
our
traditions.
the
concept
is
basically
that
in
an
insurrection,
which
we
did
not
have
here,
in
an
insurrection
the
governor
could
do
whatever
he
pleases
to
put
down
the
insurrection.
in
fact,
in
ex
parte
milligan,
the
court
held
that
there
was
only
one
thing
that
an
insurrection
or
rebellion
change,
and
that
was
he
permitted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
be
suspended
during
the
continuation
of
the
insurrection.
we
don’t
have
either
of
those
issues
here.
we
don’t
have
an
insurrection.
we
don’t
have
here
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
writ
was
properly
suspended.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
view
that
talk
as
being
basically
connected
with
the
court’s
decision
on
the
cause
of
action.
that
is
all
that
i
see
there
and
i
think
that
the
opinion
bears
it
out.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
i
think
that
was
the
holding
of
the
case.
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
specifically
overruled
by
chief
justice
hughes’
opinion
in
sterling
versus
constantin,
the
specific
holding
of
the
un-reviewability
of
the
determination
of
the
existence
of
insurrection
and
so
what
we’re
left
with
as
to
moyer
is
the
dictum
that
justice
holmes
issued.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
sir.
well,
with
respect
--
i
read
that
dictum
as
being
related
to
the
power
of
the
governor
to
do
whatever
the
governor
feels
necessary.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
exactly
what
i
read.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
yes,
your
honor.
i
read
it
that
way.
i
read
the
case
--
i
read
both
cases
as
having
no
bearing
on
immunity,
but
having
bearing
on
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
our
position
is
we
rely
for
a
substantive
theory.
again,
going
to
the
cause
of
action
rather
than
immunity
issue,
we
rely
on
monroe
versus
pape
and
the
few
expressions
in
dictum
in
this
court’s
opinions
in
d.c.
versus
carter
and
in
moore
versus
alameda
county.
specific
intention
to
cause
injury
or
deprive
one
of
the
constitutional
right
is
a
prerequisite
to
establishing
criminal
liability
under
section
18
us
code,
section
241
which
is
the
criminal
analogue
of
section
1983.
in
monroe,
the
court
specifically
dealt
with
the
distinction
on
how
that
specific
intention
is
not
necessary,
rather,
section
1983
was
to
be
interpreted
in
line
with
the
intention
of
congress
to
reach
governmental
misuse
of
force
and
with
the
preexisting
body
of
tort
law
which
founded
liability
on
fault.
so
that,
the
only
question
that
relates
to
the
viability
of
the
cause
of
action
is
whether
or
not
we
have
alleged
and
proved
fault
on
the
part
of
the
individual
defendants
which
fault
lead
to
the
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right,
in
this
case,
the
right
not
to
kill.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i’m
using
fault
in
the
sense
of
either
wrongful
intention,
recklessness,
wanton
and
willful
misconduct,
or
negligence.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
mere
negligence.
now,
as
to
mere
negligence,
this
court
has
not
passed
directly
on
that
issue.
the
weight
of
authority
in
the
circuit
courts
is
that
mere
negligence
when
tied
to
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right,
for
example
negligence
leading
to
a
misuse
of
weapons
by
governmental
troops,
states
a
claim
under
section
1983.
and,
in
my
brief,
i’ve
cited
the
case
on
which
you
rely
for
that
proposition.
i
believe
monroe
versus
walter
(ph).
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
well,
there
again,
judge
seligricci's
dissent
didn’t
have
to
reach
out
to
the
question
of
the
cause
of
action.
we
have
alleged,
and
i
believe
we
can
prove,
although
we
have
no
record
before
us,
that
what
we
allege.
we
have
alleged
intentional
conduct.
we’ve
alleged
recklessness
and,
we’ve
alleged
wanton
and
willful
misconduct.
we
believe
that
this
point
is
not
incumbent
in
us
to
prove
it.
we
can’t
prove
that
before
this
court.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
your
honor,
we
are
not
claiming
the
liability
of
the
governor
flows
from
the
fact
that
the
government
called
out
the
guard,
that
is
not
the
basis
for
liability
in
this
case.
we
have
alleged
with
great
specificity
what
we
rely
on.
we
rely
on
orders.
we
rely
on
the
rules
of
engagement
which
existed
at
the
time
in
the
ohio
national
guard
which
the
governor
knew
about,
specifically
the
orders
to
carry
loaded
weapons,
the
orders
to
march
head
on
with
bayonets
out
into
a
crowd.
these
are
matters
of
record
as
a
consequence
of
gilligan
versus
morgan
and,
we
rely
on
them.
we
do
not
rely
on
the
mere
act
of
calling
out
the
guard.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
didn’t
mean
to
say
that.
we’re
not
claiming
negligence
in
calling
out
the
guard.
we’re
claiming
negligence
in
the
way
in
which
the
guard
is
supervised,
in
the
way
in
which
the
governor
acts
himself,
at
the
scene.
those
are
the
things
that
we’re
relying
upon.
we
don’t
have
to
reach
out
for
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
guard
was
negligently
called
out
here.
now,
your
honors
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
now,
we
are
claiming
that
the
constitution
protects
one
from
being
killed
or
injured
by
the
use
of
governmental
force
without
due
process
of
law
and
by
due
process
of
law,
we
simply
mean
a
hearing.
the
government
to
the
extent
that
the
governments
can
injure
one
or
can
kill
one,
it
can
only
do
so
insofar
as
it
acts
legitimately
in
defense
of
appropriate
interests
or
it
does
so
through
the
criminal
process.
now,
we
rely
--
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
we
rely
primarily
on
the
screws
case.
i
rely
very
heavily
on
the
legislative
history.
this
is
precisely
what
the
1871
congress
was
concerned
with.
the
civil
rights
act
has
reached
out
to
cover
many
areas.
the
core
of
the
congress
is
concerned
with
killings
and
beatings.
we
rely
on
screws
which
holds
that
specifically.
i
rely
on
the
dictum
in
district
of
columbia
versus
carter
and
we
rely
on
a
long
line
of
circuit
court
opinions
which
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
use
of
governmental
force
outside
of
the
criminal
process
is
a
violation
of
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
the
latest
opinion
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
which
explores
the
area
most
carefully,
is
chief
judge
friendly’s
opinion
in
johnson
versus
glick.
we
rely
on
that
case
and
the
cases
it
cites.
now
if
could,
we
have
heard
a
lot
in
this
case
about
the
facts.
it
has
been
my
feeling
all
along,
as
expressed
by
the
opinion
of
the
courts
below,
that
somehow
they
read
the
newspapers
and
took
judicial
notice
of
the
conclusion
that
everything
the
guard
did
was
proper
and
that
there
was
an
insurrection
or
something
close
to
it.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
are
no
affidavits
in
this
case.
there
are
no
such
facts.
the
affidavits
were
filed
in
the
krauss
case.
these
cases
have
not
been
consolidated.
but,
in
either
case,
what
we
have
here
is
a
complaint
that
they’re
more
than
complaints
and
the
newspapers
and
the
opinions
that
the
judges
garnished
from
the
newspapers
below
don’t
seem
to
be
to
have
any
bearing
on
the
way
in
which
the
precise
legal
issues
ought
to
be
decided
here
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
documents
in
existence
which
has
any
bearing
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
it
is
the
stratton
commission
report
which
is
not
in
the
record,
it
is
the
only
doctrine
of
which,
under
the
rules
of
evidence,
the
court
at
this
point
should
take
judicial
notice.
i
did
not
propose
the
stratton
commission
report
as
a
finding
effect.
if
this
--
but,
if
the
court
feels
some
necessity
to
go
beyond
the
pleadings,
that
is
the
only
finding
of
the
governmental
agency
which
has
dealt
with
the
subject
matter.
now,
there
--
we’ve
been
hearing
throughout
the
case
the
view
that
this
immunity
is
necessary
because,
in
the
absence
of
immunity,
the
court’s
opinion
flooded
with
complaints
these
complaints
are
all
going
to
be
frivolous
and
as
a
result
of
only
these
frivolous
complaints,
the
government
is
going
to
stop.
people
are
just
going
to
stop
acting.
it
is
not
a
description
of
this
case.
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
federal
district
court
should
not
be
presumed
to
be
filing
frivolous
paper.
he
signs,
rule
11
requires
the
complaint
to
be
signed.
he’s
subject
to
disbarment
for
filing
frivolous
complaints.
and
finally,
the
argument,
when
you
analyze
it,
supposedly
comes
down
to
the
old
argument
that
if
you
permit
this
kind
of
suit,
the
courts
are
going
to
be
flooded.
that
is
precisely
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
bevins
case.
mr.
michael
e.
geltner
i
understand
the
distinction,
but
underlying
it
is
the
view
that
the
courts
will
be
flooded
by
complaints
of
this
kind,
which,
flooding
will
then
result
in
lawsuit
judicial
time,
lawsuit
attorney’s
time,
lawsuit
official
time
and
intimidation.
in
substance
it's
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
the
bevins
case.
it’s
the
same
argument
that
was
rejected.
and
further,
it
requires
this
court
to
make
basically
a
legislative
finding
of
fact
and
i
think
the
congress
has
made
that
finding
of
fact.
congress
considered
these
issues
when
congress
acted.
and
at
this
point,
the
court,
in
order
to
reverse
the
congressional
decision,
would
in
effect
be
making
a
legislative
act
in
a
face
of
another
legislative
act
without
any
empirical
basis
to
support
it.
so,
i
think
that
all
of
those
theories
are
just
untenable
as
a
basis
for
either
the
eleventh
amendment
ground
or
the
executive
immunity
ground.
thank
you,
your
honors.
