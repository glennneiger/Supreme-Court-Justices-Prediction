justice
thurgood
marshall
but
here
you
don’t
have
a
right
to
work.
you
have
a
right
to
organize.
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
point
involved
in
this
case
as
to
whether
these
supervisors
had
the
right
to
organize.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
they
fired
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
organization?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
the
labor
act
is
set
up
to
control
organizing
of
labors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
am
talking
about
is
you
keep
saying
that
this
is
the
right
to
work
that
north
carolina
statute
is
interested
in
protecting
the
right
to
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
right
to
work
is
not
involved
i
submit
in
this
case.
it’s
the
right
to
organize
that
is
involved,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
go
to
the
hanna
law
basis.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
filed
charges
that
they
had
interfered
with
the
right
to
organize?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
participate
in
the
union
and
the
nlrb
said
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
nlrb
said
that
we
don’t
have
a
jurisdiction
because
supervisory
employees
are
not
under
our
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
now
you
go
to
the
state
court
on
the
right
to
work?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
hanna
was
seven
and
eight,
are
you
sure
it
is
fourteen?
hanna
manufacturing
company?
hanna
mining?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
does
it
involve
section
7
and
8?
justice
thurgood
marshall

back
to
the
other
question,
