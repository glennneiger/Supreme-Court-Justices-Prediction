unknown
speaker
did
the
supervisor
here
join
the
collective
bargaining
agents
here?
unknown
speaker
now
let’s
assume
that
the
supervisor
decides
he
wants
to
join
the
union
who
is
a
collective
bargaining
agent.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
this
164
doesn’t
relieve
the
employer
from
bargaining
with
the
bargaining
agent
just
because
the
bargaining
agent
has
some
its
supervisor
member.
unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
is
that
settled.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
the
employer
--
so
that
if
the
supervisor
joins
the
wrong
union,
and
if
he
joins
the
bargaining
agent,
the
employer
is
excused
from
bargaining
without
bargaining
agent,
is
that
what
you
said?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
that
if
the
other
way,
there
might
be
a
better
argument
for
firing
him.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stockton,
may
i
ask.
i
noticed
that
mr.
eubanks’
brief
at
page
3
has
a
short
paragraph,
third
from
the
bottom.
“the
union
began
in
organizing
campaign
that
defendant
winston-salem
in
north
carolina
stores
in
the
spring
of
1971.
in
the
course
of
that
organizing
campaign,
the
three
petitioners
named
herein
signed
a
membership
application
to
join
the
union
and
were
accepted
in
the
membership
in
april
and
may
of
1971.
there’s
no
evidence
that
they
actually
engaged
in
any
pro-union
activity.”
do
you
accept
that
as
an
active
statement
of
facts?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
asking
you,
does
that
accurately
state
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
well
do
they
engage
in
any
other
pro-union
activity?
unknown
speaker
so
let’s
assume
that
--
well
perhaps
i
should
put
it
to
you
this
way.
is
it
your
position
that
standing
alone,
the
fact
that
during
an
organizing
campaign,
they
signed
a
membership
application
to
join
and
were
accepted
in
the
membership?
is
it
your
position
that
standing
alone,
that
brings
you
within
the
proviso
of
14
(a)
as
employees
for
the
purpose
of
any
law
relating
to
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
i
ask
you
whether
standing
alone
you
would
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
few
facts
about
whether
or
not
an
employer
could
be
or
would
be
under
the
law
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
upheld
bargaining
with
a
bargaining
agent
you
had
supervisors
as
members.
now,
let’s
assume
that
--
let’s
assume
that
this
union
won
the
election
and
i
submit
that
it
was
--
other
things
being
influenced
with
the
bargaining
agent,
now
the
employer
says
i
will
refuse
the
bargain
with
you
because
you
have
some
of
my
supervisors
as
members.
what’s
the
--
if
the
lawyer
--
is
the
employer
excuse
--
unknown
speaker
well,
don’t
you
think
that’s
the
answer
to
the
question
bears
somewhat
on
the
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn’t
be
making
this
argument
that
the
supervisors
have
joined
the
union
of
their
own
and
they
never
ask
for
any
bargaining
rights?
unknown
speaker
for
the
same
reason?
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
proviso
in
14
(a)
gives
you
any
comfort
in
that
respect
because
the
supervisor
said
we
have
no
collective
bargaining.
we
do
not
bargain
with
you
at
all.
we
are
sort
of
involved.
unknown
speaker
where
and
the
union
itself
is
a
collective
bargaining
--
in
the
business
of
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
mr.
stockton
that
when
these
three
supervisors
went
to
the
union
and
asked
the
union
to
file
a
complaint
with
the
labor
board
for
this
conduct
that
that
was
engaging
in
union
activity
to
ask
the
union
to
represent
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
it
--
said
he
want
to
service
you
and
that
really
means
according
to
you
that
the
labor
law,
the
federal
statute
guarantees
to
the
employer
the
right
to
fire
any
supervisor
who
joins
the
union?
unknown
speaker
now
that
is
pretty
hard
to
take,
isn’t
it
in
the
view
of
the
first
sentence
of
14
(a)
that
says
nothing
herein
shall
interfere
with
the
right
of
supervisor
to
join?
unknown
speaker
that
maybe
so.
but
what
you’re
saying
is
that
the
federal
law
also
prevents
a
state
from
giving
the
supervisor
some
protection.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
you
have
to
say
that
the
labor
law
guarantees
the
employer
the
right
to
fire.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
do
you
preempt
state
law?
unknown
speaker
i
take
unless
the
federal
law
guarantees
the
right
to
fire.
the
state
says,
you
don’t
have
the
right
to
fire.
if
you
fire
you
are
going
to
be
sued
for
damage,
you
maybe
sued
for
damages.
unknown
speaker
put
it
in
any
words
you
wanted.
unknown
speaker
put
it
in
any
words
you
wanted.
you
are
saying
the
federal
statute
guarantees
the
employer
the
right
to
fire
as
against
any
contrary
provision
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
eubanks.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
personnel
joined
the
union
to
which
the
majority
of
his
employees
also
belonged
and
which
was
the
collective
bargaining
agency
for
the
company.
but
also
assume
that
this
vice
president
said
of
course,
i
am
not
going
to
take
any
part
in
negotiating
with
the
union.
under
your
submission
would
the
company
be
entitled
to
discharge
him?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
he
took
no
part
in
the
bargaining.
he
said,
“i
am
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
that.
my
duties
relate
to
the
personnel
of
this
plant.
some
body
else
can
bargain.”
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
was
executive
vice
president
--
unknown
speaker
--
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
personnel.
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute,
i
don’t
understand
you.
the
executive
vice
president
could
not
be
discharged
if
he
belonged
to
the
union?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
that
north
carolina
statute
applies
the
biblical
injunction
against
saving
two
masters?
unknown
speaker
did
the
supervisor
here
join
the
collective
bargaining
agents
here?
unknown
speaker
now
let’s
assume
that
the
supervisor
decides
he
wants
to
join
the
union
who
is
a
collective
bargaining
agent.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
this

just
because
the

unknown
speaker
alright.
unknown
speaker
is
that

unknown
speaker
so
that
if
the

so
that
if
the

joins
the

and
if
he
joins
the
bargaining
