justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
to
establish
don’t
you
mr.
eubanks
that
the
north
carolina
law
is
not
a
law
relating
to
collective
bargaining
under
14
(a)
and
your
contention
since
all
it
talks
about
his
membership
in
the
union,
it
doesn’t
require
an
employer
to
do
anything
once
a
man
is
in
the
union.
it
is
not
a
law
related
to
collective
bargaining.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
your
example
of
the
ordinary
employee
is
the
easy
case
because
there,
the
federal
law
protects
that
right
and
obviously
it
wouldn’t
get
this
far
with
that
kind
of
a
situation.
but
then
it
makes
your
problem
more
difficult
if
the
man
is
a
supervisor
and
so
you
do
have
to
address
the
supervisor
on
14
(a)
which
doesn’t
affect
ordinary
employees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
union
activity
isn’t
all
that
clear.
is
it
that
it
would
extend
to
the
mere
joining
of
a
union?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say
that
the
north
carolina
law
here
that
prevents
a
man
from
being
fired
for
either
joining
or
not
joining
a
union
is
a
law
relating
to
collective
bargaining
under
14
(a)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
they
want
there,
all
they
said
they
were
doing
was
joining
the
union.
they
weren’t
making
any
demand
as
i
understand
that
the
employer
bargained
with
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
14
(a).
the
first
part
of
proviso
says,
nothing
herein
shall
prohibit
any
individual
employee
employed
as
a
supervisor
from
becoming
or
remembering
or
remaining
a
member
of
a
labor
organization,
so
that
bridge
has
been
crossed
by
congress,
this
conflict
business
by
blowing
into
a
labor
organization.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don’t
have
to
be
bargained
with?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
you
say
that
in
view
of
the
first
section
of
14
(a)
that
says,
nothing
herein
shall
prohibit
any
individual
employed
as
a
supervisor
from
becoming
a
member
of
a
labor
organization?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
there’s
a
conflict
between
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
which
do
you
take?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
you
say
he
can
be
fired
simply
for
joining
a
union?
