mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
came
through
the
entire
court
procedures
of
north
carolina
from
the
trial
court
to
the
north
carolina
appellate
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
that’s
on
certiorari
here.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
a
rather
exhaustive
opinion
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
of
north
carolina
which
had
simply
recited
the
hanna
mining
case
and
said
that
on
the
basis
of
hanna,
the
state
court
was
not
preempted
and
reversed
the
trial
court.
the
supreme
court
reversed
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
and
held
it
reviewed
the
legislative
intent
carefully
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments
of
1947
and
the
statute
14
(a)
and
incidentally
mr.
eubanks
says
nothing
about
14
(b)
which
requires
an
agreement
and
i
assume
--
we
submit
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
there
is
no
union
security
agreement
in
this
case.
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
referred
to
section
14
(a)
to
the
fact
that
in
the
1947
taft-hartley
amendments,
congress
specifically
removed
supervisors
from
the
definition
of
employees
and
from
the
general
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
didn’t
understand
your
question
your
honor,
it
was
a
reference
to
the
citation
that
hanna
mining
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
it
involves
section
7
and
8
and
the
fact
that
in
hanna
this
court
said
that
this
was
a
supervisory
union,
supervisor’s
union
in
hanna.
the
court
--
this
court
said
in
that
case,
they
are
supervisors
so
they
are
outside
seven
and
eight.
we’ll
also
go
further
and
we’ll
look
to
see
whether
there
is
any
other
federal
labor
policy
that
would
preempt
the
state
court
from
acting.
and
we
say
--
this
court
says
in
hanna,
the
committee
reports
revealed
that
congress
propelling
intention
was
to
relieve
employers
from
any
compulsion
under
the
act
and
under
state
law
to
countenance
of
bargain
with
any
union
of
supervisory
employees
so
that
this
court
said
on
seven
and
eight,
it’s
out,
the
supervisors.
and
so
far
as
the
overriding
federal
labor
policy,
what
the
state
court
did
in
enjoining
the
supervisor’s
union
from
that
picketing
was
in
accord
with
congressional
intent
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
indicated
by
the
committee
reports
and
therefore
we
--
this
court
said
we
will
not
preempt.
but
that’s
where
our
court
of
appeals
got
off
the
track
on
hanna
because
the
instant
case
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
they
referred
to
section
211
the
definition
of
taking
supervisors
out
of
the
definition
of
employees,
section
14
(a)
as
--
and
the
legislative
history
and
the
federal
court
cases
--
circuit
court
cases.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
the
section
14
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
what
says
that
the
state
is
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
to
a
supervisor.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
they
referred
to
section
14
(a).
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
which
says
nothing
prohibits
the
supervisor.
nothing
in
this
act,
the
1947
amendment
prohibits
the
supervisor
from
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
the
labor
organization
but
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no
sir,
it
says
but
no
employer
subject
to
this
sub-chapter
which
we
are
shall
be
compelled
to
deem
individuals
defined
herein
as
supervisors
with
these
plaintiffs
and
these
civil
damage
state
suits
as
employees
for
the
purpose
of
any
law,
either
national
or
local
relating
to
collective
bargaining
and
this
state
court
action
is
bound
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
this
is
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
in
the
state
statute
itself?
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
in
the
action
of
the
state.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
compliant
that
says
we
are
relating
this
to
collective
bargaining.
but
as
practical
matter,
it
has
to
relate
to
collective
bargaining
because
under
--
or
example
if
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
amendments
are
very
clear,
they’re
in
the
brief
have
very
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
at
this
time?
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
they
are
no
longer
members
of
the
union
when
they
start
the
suit,
is
that
your
question,
your
honor?
no,
i
would
say
not
your
honor
because
at
the
time
they
were
supervisors
for
this
defendant.
they
then
joined
the
union,
now
the
legislative
history
is
clear
if
it
please
the
court
on
this
matter.
senator
taft
in
speaking
to
these
amendments
said
specifically
speaking
of
supervisors
and
this
is
in
the
brief.
they
are
subject
to
discharge
for
union
activity
and
they
are
generally
restored
to
the
basis
which
they
enjoyed
before
passage
of
the
wagner
act.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well,
if
they
joined
a
union
in
the
process
of
a
union
election
going
on
then
we
would
say
this
is
certainly
union
activity.
there
they’re
joining
sides
with
the
union.
they
are
supervisory.
they
are
managers
actually
of
these
markets.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
think
it
has
to.
and
if
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no
sir,
but
when
they
joined
the
union,
they
are
a
necessity
affecting
the
employer's
collective
bargaining
rights.
he
is
dealing
with
a
union
which
has
his
supervisors
in
it
who
maybe
either
trying
to
override
the
rank
and
file
membership
in
his
favor
or
undermine
him
in
the
employee’s
favor
contrary
to
the
legislative
intent
which
has
been
specifically
set
out
backing
up
these
1947
amendments
to
provide
a
balance
between
the
employer
and
employee.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
they
ruled
them
out
of
the
bargaining
union
insofar
as
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that’s
one
possibility.
but
there
are
other
possibilities,
they
--
for
example,
this
legislative
history
says
that
no
one
whether
employer
or
employee
need
to
have
as
his
agent,
one
is
who
is
obligated
to
the
other
side.
this
--
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
this
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
the
conflict
is
recognized
by
congress
in
enacting
--
in
taking
supervisors
out
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
enacting
14
(a)
and
that
it
relates
to
the
day
to
day
activities
and
the
possibility
of
domination
of
the
union
by
the
supervisory
member
of
the
union
and
says
specifically
evidence
before
the
committee
shows
clearly
that
unionizing
supervisors
under
the
labor
act
is
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
don’t
know
the
answer
your
honor
but
i
think
the
question
reveals
the
problems
that
and
the
fact
that
we
are
actually
dealing
with
questions
of
collective
bargaining
when
you
give
a
state
court
a
right
to
give
a
remedy
and
state
court
damages
in
this
type
of
situation.
i
might
make
this
point,
if
the
state
right-to-work
law
is
not
preempted
as
to
these
supervisors’
then
insofar
as
interstate
commerce
employers,
employers
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
the
only
people
protected
would
be
the
supervisors.
the
employees
are
obviously
out.
they
are
within
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
case
is
here.
this
statement
made
by
mr.
eubanks
is
a
statement
he
makes.
the
case
is
here
actually
almost
pleading.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
don’t
accept
that
as
the
actual
facts.
i
say
to
the
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
my
judgment
they
did.
it’s
not
really
in
the
record
before
this
court
because
it
comes
on
before
this
court
on
the
pleadings
in
an
affidavit.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
if
you
honor
please,
i
would
hate
to
restrict
it
that
closely
but
i
think
that’s
what
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
would
take
that
position
and
i
think
that’s
what
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
has
said
because
of
the
overriding
legislative
intent
to
discourage
unionization
of
supervisors,
clearly
evidenced
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
1947
amendments
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
am
very
much
afraid
the
employer
might
have
to
bargain
with
that
union.
i
don’t
know
the
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
it
may
and
it
again
indicates
the
fact
that
state
court
action
here
is
becoming
intermeddled
in
a
field
which
should
be
preempted
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
and
then
were
fired?
yes,
sir
your
honor.
because
the
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well,
possibly
for
all
the
reasons
i
think
the
--
there
is
no
more
conflict
where
they
joined
they
rank
and
file
union,
no
question
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
think
14
(a)
would
be
more
of
a
problem
in
that
situation
but
here
they
joined
in
the
rank
and
file
union,
along
to
by
the
other
employees
of
the
same
employer.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
hadn’t
thought
of
that
your
honor.
i
suppose
that
could
be
argued.
they
did
go
to
the
union.
the
union
filed
a
complaint
for
them.
they
are
--
it
is
union
activity
in
a
common
sense
respect
i
think
if
your
honor
please
without
any
question.
and
i
think
we
could
take
that
position
of
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no
sir,
on
the
record.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
case
came
on
a
motion
on
the
pleadings
and
the
record
is
--
the
allegation
that
they
were
fired
because
they
joined
the
union
which
we
moved
to
dismiss
as
not
stating
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
that’s
the
record
insofar
as
the
case
is
before
this
court
if
your
honor
please
in
the
procedural
manner
in
which
it
came
here
was
the
only
way
that
could
be
actually.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
if
they
cross
the
picket
line,
yes
sir
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
the
congress
throughout
the
hearing
is
on
these
statute
referred
to
the
conflict,
the
right
to
have
a
loyal
supervisor.
the
possible
conflict
on
the
other
side
of
the
domination
of
the
supervisor
over
the
rank
and
file
in
a
mixed
union,
and
the
situation
here
would
be
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
if
your
honor
please,
the
other
part
is
the
most
important
and
these
hearings,
the
reports
of
the
hearings
make
it
very
clear
that
the
supervisors
do
not
need
to
be
treated
as
employees.
and
that
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that’s
right
but
that
they
don’t
have
any
longer
the
right
to
join
a
union
which
is
protected
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
they’re
out
there,
they
restored
to
their
rights
before
the
wagner
act
according
as
to
what
senator
taft
says
and
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
the
legislative
history
says
that
your
honor
and
some
of
the
cases
say
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
here’s
the
point,
there’s
nothing
to
keep
and
it's
said
in
here.
in
some
of
the
cases
too
not
from
this
court
but
from
federal
court,
nothing
keeps
a
supervisor
from
joining
the
union.
but
in
the
interest
of
the
balance
of
power
and
maintaining
a
loyal
supervisor
personnel,
nothing
keeps
the
employer
for
firing
him
for
union
activity,
for
joining
a
union
outside.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
think
we
have
to
say
it
on
this
case
on
the
record.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
it
is
taking
in
context
with
the
entire
statement
and
taking
in
context
with
--
that
is
the
entire
statement
in
14
(a)
that
the
supervisor
does
not
have
to
treat
him
as
an
employee
under
the
act.
he’s
got
a
right
to
join
the
union
but
the
employer
on
the
other
side
has
got
the
right
to
treat
him
not
as
an
employee
at
all.
he
doesn’t
have
the
protection
of
the
act.
not
to
be
fired
without
--
fired
for
a
union
activity.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
go
that
far.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
you
preempt
state
law
simply
because
of
the
conflict
created
between
the
state
and
the
federal
for
example.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
the
federal
says
though,
you
don’t
have
to
treat
him,
supervisor
employee
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
--
as
an
employee.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no
sir,
i’m
saying
that
the
state
law
is
preempted
in
this
particular
field
and
that
to
create
a
right
of
action,
civil
damage
right
of
action
would
create
all
the
problems
that
congress
has
talked
about
in
the
legislative
history
and
that
i
say
that
a
lot
of
part
of
14
(a)
is
in
that
to
provide
against.
for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
the
employer
would
be
subject
to
the
federal
law
as
to
employees,
the
state
law
as
to
supervisors.
the
supervisors
would
be
subject
to
state
law
and
the
employees
would
be
subject
to
federal
law.
so
that
you
would
have
the
resulting
absolute
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law
in
situations
in
which
congress
has
indicated
and
this
court
has
indicated.
there
should
be
some
uniform
approach
at
federal
labor
policy
and
we
say
that
under
the
previous
cases,
hanna
mining
is
the
opposite
of
this
case
and
i
think
i
got
into
that
for
a
moment.
hanna
mining
through
that
court
of
appeals
are
because
they
took
the
position
that
supervisors
where
involved
so
hanna
mining
says
no
preemption
of
the
state
so
that’s
what
we
hope,
hanna
mining
did
not
hope
well
as
i
attempted
to
explain
a
few
minutes
ago.
our
position
is
if
it
please
the
court
that
under
the
federal
statutes,
under
the
underlying
purpose
of
a
uniform
approach,
federal
labor
policy
under
the
cases
on
preemption
of
this
court
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
is
correct
and
that
the
state
is
preempted
from
applying
this
particular
statute
as
to
supervisors
in
a
state
court
damage
action.
thank
you.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
came
through
the
entire
court
procedures
of
north
carolina
from
the
trial
court
to
the
north
carolina
appellate
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
that’s
on
certiorari
here.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
a
rather
exhaustive
opinion
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
of
north
carolina
which
had
simply
recited
the
hanna
mining
case
and
said
that
on
the
basis
of
hanna,
the
state
court
was
not
preempted
and
reversed
the
trial
court.
the
supreme
court
reversed
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
and
held
it
reviewed
the
legislative
intent
carefully
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments
of
1947
and
the
statute
14
(a)
and
incidentally
mr.
eubanks
says
nothing
about
14
(b)
which
requires
an
agreement
and
i
assume
--
we
submit
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
there
is
no
union
security
agreement
in
this
case.
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
referred
to
section
14
(a)
to
the
fact
that
in
the
1947
taft-hartley
amendments,
congress
specifically
removed
supervisors
from
the
definition
of
employees
and
from
the
general
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
didn’t
understand
your
question
your
honor,
it
was
a
reference
to
the
citation
that
hanna
mining
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
it
involves
section
7
and
8
and
the
fact
that
in
hanna
this
court
said
that
this
was
a
supervisory
union,
supervisor’s
union
in
hanna.
the
court
--
this
court
said
in
that
case,
they
are
supervisors
so
they
are
outside
seven
and
eight.
we’ll
also
go
further
and
we’ll
look
to
see
whether
there
is
any
other
federal
labor
policy
that
would
preempt
the
state
court
from
acting.
and
we
say
--
this
court
says
in
hanna,
the
committee
reports
revealed
that
congress
propelling
intention
was
to
relieve
employers
from
any
compulsion
under
the
act
and
under
state
law
to
countenance
of
bargain
with
any
union
of
supervisory
employees
so
that
this
court
said
on
seven
and
eight,
it’s
out,
the
supervisors.
and
so
far
as
the
overriding
federal
labor
policy,
what
the
state
court
did
in
enjoining
the
supervisor’s
union
from
that
picketing
was
in
accord
with
congressional
intent
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
indicated
by
the
committee
reports
and
therefore
we
--
this
court
said
we
will
not
preempt.
but
that’s
where
our
court
of
appeals
got
off
the
track
on
hanna
because
the
instant
case
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
they
referred
to
section
211
the
definition
of
taking
supervisors
out
of
the
definition
of
employees,
section
14
(a)
as
--
and
the
legislative
history
and
the
federal
court
cases
--
circuit
court
cases.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
the
section
14
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
what
says
that
the
state
is
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
to
a
supervisor.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
they
referred
to
section
14
(a).
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
which
says
nothing
prohibits
the
supervisor.
nothing
in
this
act,
the
1947
amendment
prohibits
the
supervisor
from
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
the
labor
organization
but
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no
sir,
it
says
but
no
employer
subject
to
this
sub-chapter
which
we
are
shall
be
compelled
to
deem
individuals
defined
herein
as
supervisors
with
these
plaintiffs
and
these
civil
damage
state
suits
as
employees
for
the
purpose
of
any
law,
either
national
or
local
relating
to
collective
bargaining
and
this
state
court
action
is
bound
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
this
is
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
in
the
state
statute
itself?
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
in
the
action
of
the
state.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
compliant
that
says
we
are
relating
this
to
collective
bargaining.
but
as
practical
matter,
it
has
to
relate
to
collective
bargaining
because
under
--
or
example
if
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
amendments
are
very
clear,
they’re
in
the
brief
have
very
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
at
this
time?
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
they
are
no
longer
members
of
the
union
when
they
start
the
suit,
is
that
your
question,
your
honor?
no,
i
would
say
not
your
honor
because
at
the
time
they
were
supervisors
for
this
defendant.
they
then
joined
the
union,
now
the
legislative
history
is
clear
if
it
please
the
court
on
this
matter.
senator
taft
in
speaking
to
these
amendments
said
specifically
speaking
of
supervisors
and
this
is
in
the
brief.
they
are
subject
to
discharge
for
union
activity
and
they
are
generally
restored
to
the
basis
which
they
enjoyed
before
passage
of
the
wagner
act.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well,
if
they
joined
a
union
in
the
process
of
a
union
election
going
on
then
we
would
say
this
is
certainly
union
activity.
there
they’re
joining
sides
with
the
union.
they
are
supervisory.
they
are
managers
actually
of
these
markets.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
think
it
has
to.
and
if
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no
sir,
but
when
they
joined
the
union,
they
are
a
necessity
affecting
the
employer's
collective
bargaining
rights.
he
is
dealing
with
a
union
which
has
his
supervisors
in
it
who
maybe
either
trying
to
override
the
rank
and
file
membership
in
his
favor
or
undermine
him
in
the
employee’s
favor
contrary
to
the
legislative
intent
which
has
been
specifically
set
out
backing
up
these
1947
amendments
to
provide
a
balance
between
the
employer
and
employee.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
they
ruled
them
out
of
the
bargaining
union
insofar
as
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that’s
one
possibility.
but
there
are
other
possibilities,
they
--
for
example,
this
legislative
history
says
that
no
one
whether
employer
or
employee
need
to
have
as
his
agent,
one
is
who
is
obligated
to
the
other
side.
this
--
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
this
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
the
conflict
is
recognized
by
congress
in
enacting
--
in
taking
supervisors
out
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
enacting
14
(a)
and
that
it
relates
to
the
day
to
day
activities
and
the
possibility
of
domination
of
the
union
by
the
supervisory
member
of
the
union
and
says
specifically
evidence
before
the
committee
shows
clearly
that
unionizing
supervisors
under
the
labor
act
is
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
don’t
know
the
answer
your
honor
but
i
think
the
question
reveals
the
problems
that
and
the
fact
that
we
are
actually
dealing
with
questions
of
collective
bargaining
when
you
give
a
state
court
a
right
to
give
a
remedy
and
state
court
damages
in
this
type
of
situation.
i
might
make
this
point,
if
the
state
right-to-work
law
is
not
preempted
as
to
these
supervisors’
then
insofar
as
interstate
commerce
employers,
employers
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
the
only
people
protected
would
be
the
supervisors.
the
employees
are
obviously
out.
they
are
within
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
case
is
here.
this
statement
made
by
mr.
eubanks
is
a
statement
he
makes.
the
case
is
here
actually
almost
pleading.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
don’t
accept
that
as
the
actual
facts.
i
say
to
the
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
my
judgment
they
did.
it’s
not
really
in
the
record
before
this
court
because
it
comes
on
before
this
court
on
the
pleadings
in
an
affidavit.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
if
you
honor
please,
i
would
hate
to
restrict
it
that
closely
but
i
think
that’s
what
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
would
take
that
position
and
i
think
that’s
what
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
has
said
because
of
the
overriding
legislative
intent
to
discourage
unionization
of
supervisors,
clearly
evidenced
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
1947
amendments
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
am
very
much
afraid
the
employer
might
have
to
bargain
with
that
union.
i
don’t
know
the
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
it
may
and
it
again
indicates
the
fact
that
state
court
action
here
is
becoming
intermeddled
in
a
field
which
should
be
preempted
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
and
then
were
fired?
yes,
sir
your
honor.
because
the
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well,
possibly
for
all
the
reasons
i
think
the
--
there
is
no
more
conflict
where
they
joined
they
rank
and
file
union,
no
question
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
think
14
(a)
would
be
more
of
a
problem
in
that
situation
but
here
they
joined
in
the
rank
and
file
union,
along
to
by
the
other
employees
of
the
same
employer.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
hadn’t
thought
of
that
your
honor.
i
suppose
that
could
be
argued.
they
did
go
to
the
union.
the
union
filed
a
complaint
for
them.
they
are
--
it
is
union
activity
in
a
common
sense
respect
i
think
if
your
honor
please
without
any
question.
and
i
think
we
could
take
that
position
of
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no
sir,
on
the
record.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
case
came
on
a
motion
on
the
pleadings
and
the
record
is
--
the
allegation
that
they
were
fired
because
they
joined
the
union
which
we
moved
to
dismiss
as
not
stating
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
that’s
the
record
insofar
as
the
case
is
before
this
court
if
your
honor
please
in
the
procedural
manner
in
which
it
came
here
was
the
only
way
that
could
be
actually.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
if
they
cross
the
picket
line,
yes
sir
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor
and
the
congress
throughout
the
hearing
is
on
these
statute
referred
to
the
conflict,
the
right
to
have
a
loyal
supervisor.
the
possible
conflict
on
the
other
side
of
the
domination
of
the
supervisor
over
the
rank
and
file
in
a
mixed
union,
and
the
situation
here
would
be
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
if
your
honor
please,
the
other
part
is
the
most
important
and
these
hearings,
the
reports
of
the
hearings
make
it
very
clear
that
the
supervisors
do
not
need
to
be
treated
as
employees.
and
that
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
that’s
right
but
that
they
don’t
have
any
longer
the
right
to
join
a
union
which
is
protected
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
they’re
out
there,
they
restored
to
their
rights
before
the
wagner
act
according
as
to
what
senator
taft
says
and
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
the
legislative
history
says
that
your
honor
and
some
of
the
cases
say
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
here’s
the
point,
there’s
nothing
to
keep
and
it's
said
in
here.
in
some
of
the
cases
too
not
from
this
court
but
from
federal
court,
nothing
keeps
a
supervisor
from
joining
the
union.
but
in
the
interest
of
the
balance
of
power
and
maintaining
a
loyal
supervisor
personnel,
nothing
keeps
the
employer
for
firing
him
for
union
activity,
for
joining
a
union
outside.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
i
think
we
have
to
say
it
on
this
case
on
the
record.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
it
is
taking
in
context
with
the
entire
statement
and
taking
in
context
with
--
that
is
the
entire
statement
in
14
(a)
that
the
supervisor
does
not
have
to
treat
him
as
an
employee
under
the
act.
he’s
got
a
right
to
join
the
union
but
the
employer
on
the
other
side
has
got
the
right
to
treat
him
not
as
an
employee
at
all.
he
doesn’t
have
the
protection
of
the
act.
not
to
be
fired
without
--
fired
for
a
union
activity.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
go
that
far.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
well
you
preempt
state
law
simply
because
of
the
conflict
created
between
the
state
and
the
federal
for
example.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
the
federal
says
though,
you
don’t
have
to
treat
him,
supervisor
employee
--
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
--
as
an
employee.
mr.
ralph
m.
stockton,
jr.
no
sir,
i’m
saying
that
the
state
law
is
preempted
in
this
particular
field
and
that
to
create
a
right
of
action,
civil
damage
right
of
action
would
create
all
the
problems
that
congress
has
talked
about
in
the
legislative
history
and
that
i
say
that
a
lot
of
part
of
14
(a)
is
in
that
to
provide
against.
for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
the
employer
would
be
subject
to
the
federal
law
as
to
employees,
the
state
law
as
to
supervisors.
the
supervisors
would
be
subject
to
state
law
and
the
employees
would
be
subject
to
federal
law.
so
that
you
would
have
the
resulting
absolute
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law
in
situations
in
which
congress
has
indicated
and
this
court
has
indicated.
there
should
be
some
uniform
approach
at
federal
labor
policy
and
we
say
that
under
the
previous
cases,
hanna
mining
is
the
opposite
of
this
case
and
i
think
i
got
into
that
for
a
moment.
hanna
mining
through
that
court
of
appeals
are
because
they
took
the
position
that
supervisors
where
involved
so
hanna
mining
says
no
preemption
of
the
state
so
that’s
what
we
hope,
hanna
mining
did
not
hope
well
as
i
attempted
to
explain
a
few
minutes
ago.
our
position
is
if
it
please
the
court
that
under
the
federal
statutes,
under
the
underlying
purpose
of
a
uniform
approach,
federal
labor
policy
under
the
cases
on
preemption
of
this
court
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
is
correct
and
that
the
state
is
preempted
from
applying
this
particular
statute
as
to
supervisors
in
a
state
court
damage
action.
thank
you.
