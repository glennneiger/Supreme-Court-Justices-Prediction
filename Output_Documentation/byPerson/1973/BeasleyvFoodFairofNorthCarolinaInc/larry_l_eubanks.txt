mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
on
to
be
heard
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
state
of
north
carolina.
simply,
it
involves
our
right-to-work
law
in
the
relationship
with
that
right-to-work
law
with
the
federal
substantive
and
the
federal
national
labor
relations
act.
a
factual
situation
is
one
where
three
individuals
who
were
employed
at
some
food
stores
in
north
carolina
were
terminated
right
after
a
union
election
that
was
conducted
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
our
right-to-work
law
provides
simply
that
in
north
carolina
a
person
who
has
a
right
to
live,
has
a
right
to
work
there
but
after
the
union
won
the
election,
these
three
individuals
was
fired.
and
it’s
our
position
simply
that
there
is
a
coexistence
as
possible
between
a
right-to-work
law
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
that
protects
supervisors
and
a
federal
law
which
protects
employees.
now,
the
case
is
dealing
with
the
right
of
people
that
belong
to
unions
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
constitutional
right
for
that
approach,
have
been
dealt
with
many
times
by
this
court.
first
of
all
in
the
morton
case
back
in
1940
--
tomas
v.
collins
in
1945,
the
court
stated
that
“union
membership
is
protected
by
the
right
of
association
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.”
well
what
that
meant
as
it
had
been
interpreted
later
was
as
true
so
long
as
you
know
government
interference.
in
other
words,
government
interference
came
in
if
you
have
the
right
to
association.
and
that
gave
rise
to
a
lot
of
cases
involving
people
excluded
from
coverage
on
the
national
labor
relations
act.
for
example
teachers,
policeman,
garbage
workers
and
a
lot
of
cases
they
have
extended
all
up
into
the
present
day
time.
well,
it's
our
position
simply
that
in
north
carolina
as
in
about
19
to
20
other
states,
we
have
a
law
that
says
one
of
the
group
of
people
and
that
is
supervisors
have
a
right
to
belong
to
a
union.
that
does
not
say
nor
does
our
law
say
that
a
company
or
an
employer
is
required
to
bargain
within
the
union
of
any
body
because
that’s
been
covered
by
the
federal
law.
there
is
no
credit.
it
simply
provides
that
everybody
in
north
carolina
has
a
right
to
belong
to
a
union
without
fear
of
being
fired.
now,
if
in
fact
this
case
is
preempted
or
the
state
law
is
preempted
by
federal
law
and
i
would
agree
with
the
defendant
and
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
the
state
courts
have
no
business
dealing
with.
but
it
is
really
our
position
that
this
court
in
1967,
in
the
hanna
case
has
already
answered
this
question.
we
submit
that
the
hanna
case
in
section
14
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
really
determines
and
answers
the
question
whether
or
not
a
supervisor
can
join
a
union
and
damages
for
his
discharge
because
of
his
union
membership
can
be
given
in
a
state
court.
and
that’s
the
question
we
have
here.
in
the
hanna
case,
the
court
dealt
with
section
14
(a)
and
i
would
like
for
the
court
if
i
might
to
point
out
all
of
the
words
of
14
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
it
reads
this
way
and
i
quote
“nothing
herein
shall
prohibit
any
individual
employed
as
a
supervisor
from
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
a
labor
organization.”
but
the
second
phrase
of
that
same
section
is
what
the
court
exactly
dealt
within
hanna
mining
company
that
such
statement
says,
“but
no
employer
subject
to
this
act
shall
be
compelled
to
deem
individuals
defined
herein
as
supervisors
as
employees
for
the
purpose
of
any
law,
either
national
or
local,
relating
to
collective
bargaining.”
now
the
point
i’m
making
by
reading
this
to
the
court
is
this.
first
of
all
congress
says
when
it
removes
supervisors
from
the
coverage
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
1947
by
the
taft-hartley
amendment,
supervisors
can
still
belong
to
union
but
no
longer
will
employers
be
required
to
bargain
collectively
with
unions
made
up
wholly
or
partially
a
supervisor.
now,
if
that
approach
is
maintained
under
the
federal
scheme
presently,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
conflict
with
our
right-to-work
law
and
a
protection
of
a
supervisor
and
the
federal
scheme
or
the
federal
law
is
passed
in
section
14
(a).
and
this
is
one,
in
1964
in
the
morton
case,
this
court
dealt
with
federal
preemption.
the
court
has
dealt
it
many
times
and
i
am
referring
to
case
as
generally
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
thank
you
very
much.
you
recall
just
before
the
luncheon
recess
i
quoted
to
you
a
quotation
from
the
case
called
tomas
v.
collins
which
provides
“union
membership
is
protected
by
the
right
of
association
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.”
that
was
the
1945
case
and
that
was
in
that
posture
of
the
situation
that
congress
chose
to
amend
the
wagner
act.
it
was
then
called
the
taft-hartley
amendment.
now,
i
think
it’s
reasonable
for
the
court
and
we
submit
to
the
court
if
reasonable
for
us
to
assume
that
congress
when
it
included
14
(a)
into
the
act,
it
had
some
reason
for
all
of
the
words
it
put
in
that
provision.
you
recall
what
i
read
to
you
just
before
the
recess
also
section
14
(a).
the
only
time,
i
confine
the
case
in
which
the
court
had
the
actual
situation
where
14
(a)
was
an
issue
is
the
case
called
hanna
mining
which
occurred
in
1965.
in
that
case,
the
court
talks
about
the
garmon
decision,
a
1959
decision
to
this
court
which
i’m
sure
the
court
deals
with
often
in
preemption
setting
out
in
effect
that
conduct
which
is
protected
or
by
section
7
or
prohibited
by
section
8
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
certainly
preempted
from
any
state
control.
but
in
that
case
and
then
the
hanna
case
mentions
that
there
may
be
some
other
areas
in
which
it
may
be
better
that
state
regulation
not
apply.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
one
quote
from
hanna
mining
which
raised
that
“the
grand
rules
for
preemption
in
the
labor
law
emerging
from
our
garmon
decision
that
the
case
that
is
mentioned
should
first
be
briefed
or
summarized.
in
general
a
state
may
not
regulate
conduct
arguably
protected
by
section
7
or
prohibited
by
section
8
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.”
well,
that’s
clear
and
it’s
been
clear
now
since
the
garmon
decision.
in
hanna
mining,
the
court
goes
on
to
point
out
“the
legislative
purpose
may
further
dictate
that
certain
activity,
neither
protected
nor
prohibited
be
deemed
privilege
against
state
regulation
and
continuing
for
the
reasons
that
follow,
we
believe
the
board’s
decision
that
hanna
engineers
are
supervisors
removed
from
this
case
most
of
the
opportunity
for
preemption.”
now
it
is
right
there
if
the
court
please
that
the
appellant
plaintiff
in
this
case
rests
its
position.
in
the
hanna
case,
the
court
dealt
with
a
situation
where
some
supervisory
engineers
were
attempting
to
picket,
to
obtain
a
recognition
from
an
employer.
the
employer
really
in
that
case
just
said,
“well,
i
don’t
believe
you
represent
a
true
majority.”
it
did
not
take
really
the
position
that
was
ended
up
to
start
with
but
in
that
situation
the
hanna
engineers
were
doing
exactly
what
the
last
part
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
says
says
“it
cannot
do.”
in
other
words
that
it
cannot,
no
employer
said
that
this
act
shall
be
compelled
to
treat
supervisors
as
employees
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining.
and
the
hanna
engineers
were
simply
trying
to
get
this
employer
to
do
exactly
that.
well,
in
the
hanna
case,
the
court
mentions
that
it’s
not
dealing
in
that
case
with
the
situation
where
a
person
could
become
a
supervisor
and
be
fired
for
being
a
union
member.
it
says
it’s
not
--
specifically
not
dealing
with
that
situation
and
this
court
did.
well,
the
situation
we
have
before
this
court
right
now
is
the
one
the
court
in
hanna
said
it
wasn't
going
to
deal
within
that
case.
in
1967,
a
case
called
u.s.
versus
morton
before
this
court
pointed
out
that
--
or
teamster
local
versus
morton,
this
is
in
377
u.s.,
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
preemption
1964,
i’m
sorry,
it
says
to
explain
the
preemption
doctrine
further
“the
answer
to
that
question
ultimately
depends
upon
whether
the
application
of
state
law
in
this
kind
of
case
would
operate
to
frustrate
the
purpose
of
the
federal
legislation.”
now,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
in
light
of
hanna,
the
hanna
case
and
in
light
of
the
statement
in
the
morton
case
explaining
what
is
and
what
isn’t
preempted
that
the
activity
of
these
three
individuals
who
signed
membership
cards
to
the
union
and
were
fired
as
a
result
thereof
is
not
the
kind
of
activity
if
regulated
by
the
states
would
frustrate
the
national
labor
policy.
in
the
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
your
honor.
in
this
--
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
case,
the
court
simply
ruled
in
that
decision
that
this
matter
is
preempted
by
federal
law
and
that
was
the
basis
of
their
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
it
rose
specifically
in
citing
hanna
and
other
decisions
that
he
had
not
been
preempted
and
the
supreme
court
would
reverse
but
it
relied
primarily
on
hanna
mining
in
reversing
the
court’s
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now
i
submit
to
the
court
that
hanna
mining
simply
says,
“here
is
a
state
court
trying
to
enjoin
conduct
being
engaged
in
by
some
supervisors”
which
the
national
labor
relations
act
says
“cannot
be
done.”
the
employer
is
not
required
to
countenance,
this
kind
of
conduct.
and
therefore
when
the
state
court
attempted
to
enjoin
it,
this
court
said
that’s
okay.
you
can
enjoin
that
kind
of
conduct
because
it
does
not
in
that
kind
of
application
of
state
law
frustrate
the
national
labor
policy.
well,
we
are
asking
the
court
in
this
instance
simply
to
rule,
if
congress
meant
anything
when
it
put
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
of
14
(a)
in
there
“nothing
herein
shall
prohibit
any
individual
employed
as
a
supervisor
from
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
a
labor
organization”
to
treat
the
first
half
of
that
sentence
the
same
way.
meaning
in
effect
if
people
have
a
right
to
belong
to
a
union
as
congress
has
said,
then
how
can
the
provision
for
damages
in
a
state
court
which
only
comes
into
play
if
this
people
are
not
allowed
to
exercise
that
right
frustrate
a
national
labor
policy?
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir.
we
have
a
--
does
the
supervisors
have
a
right
to
organize?
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no
sir,
that
is
i
submit
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
for
simply
signing
union
card.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir.
that’s
all
the
complain
alleged
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
yes
sir
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
organization
includes
much
more
than
just
joining
a
union.
there
are
many
situations
in
actual
life
where
frequently
people
are
members
of
a
union
where
they
don’t
even
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you
your
honor
for
this
reason
if
i
might
explain.
the
reason
i
disagree
with
you
is
this,
i
think
that
14
(a)
the
second
phrase
of
14
(a)
covers
organizing,
yes
sir.
but
i
think
it
also
permits
the
joining
of
a
union
by
one
individual
or
more
individuals
for
that
matter.
so
long
as
there
is
no
effort
on
their
part
to
go
through
the
processes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
calling
for
recognition
or
through
some
action
like
was
done
in
the
hanna
case.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
we
were
specifically
told
by
the
nlrb
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir
we
filed
charges.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
sir.
we
filed
charges
alleging
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
1
and
that
these
--
these
charges
--
they
got
caught
in
the
old
situation
dealing
with
firing
of
supervisors
to
coerce
the
employees
covered
by
the
act
and
they’re
not
participating
in
the
union.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
that
was
our
theory
before
the
nlrb.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
from
discouraging
the
employees
your
honor
as
opposed
to
anybody
else.
remember
the
act
covers
only
employees
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
they
said
--
they
clearly
said
that
and
that
was
a
decision
of
the
general
counsel.
mr.
nash
when
he
contacted
me
and
mr.
stockton
for
the
company.
the
wording
of
the
letter
was
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir.
now,
the
situation
is
one
where
--
it
is
simple
for
everybody
who
has
filed
briefs
in
this
case
except
us
seems
to
put
a
union
activity
or
organizing
and
the
signing
of
a
union
card
or
joining
a
union
into
the
same
board
it
isn’t.
i
submit
to
the
court
it
isn’t
the
same
thing.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
we
submit
if
they
were
your
honor
it
will
be
preempted
and
we
agree
with
your
position
but
we
certainly
say,
if
it
were
one
relating
to
collective
bargaining
it
would
certainly
be
preempted
because
of
14
(a)
in
the
second
half
for
that
sentence
says,
“you
can’t
require
an
employer
to
recognize
that
kind
of
situation
and
we
agree
with
that
and
with
all
the
cases
relied
on
by
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
holding
against
us
or
in
reversing
the
court
of
appeals
we
agree
with.
we
agree
with
hanna
mining,
we
agree
with
--
and
the
cases
which
spell
out
the
preemption
doctrine
and
what
is
precluded
from
state
jurisdiction
and
what
is
allowable.
you
recall
in
hanna
that
this
court
said
in
hanna
that
that
state
court
since
its
enjoining
on
conduct
that
14
(a)
says
that
supervisors
can
engage
in
therefore
does
not
frustrate
state
law.
i
mean
federal
labor
legislation
of
federal
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
that’s
what
the
court’s
position
was
your
honor
but
even
the
board
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir.
it
is.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
well,
your
honor
that’s
what
the
state
court
as
i
understood
it
said
your
honor
and
that’s
why
i
so
vehemently
disagree
with
because
even
if
you
will
come
into
the
case
called
(inaudible)
which
i
believe
--
and
it
involved
one
of
these
situations
where
a
supervisor
was
fired
because
he
was
told
to
go
out
and
engage
in
some
unlawful
conduct
on
part
of
his
employer
and
he
said,
“i
am
not
going
to
do
it”
and
the
employer
said
“well,
if
you
don’t
do
it
i
will
fire
you,”
and
he
wouldn’t
do
it
so
he
got
fired
and
the
case
went
up
through
the
board
and
it
was
ended
up
to
the
situation
that
the
board
ruled
and
was
supported
by
enforcement
that
that
really
coerced
employees
who
were
covered
by
the
act
and
by
firing
a
supervisor
who
was
being
in
an
effort
to
coerce
employees
we
feel
that
situation
is
covered
by
8
(a)
1
of
the
act
and
i
agree
fully.
but
in
so
--
if
the
employer
sits
and
contends
to
this
court
and
us
and
through
all
the
courts
that
have
gone
before
that,
look,
an
employer
should
have
an
absolute
right
to
fire
a
supervisor.
and
that’s
what
i
want
to
address
this
remark
to.
now,
i
remember
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
one
of
the
justices
asked
me
and
the
question,
“look,
this
means
that
anybody
can
be
a
union
member.
this
even
means
that
a
manger
could
be
a
union
member.”
well
i
submit
to
the
court,
they
can
be
and
it
doesn’t
mean
that
disloyalty.
somebody
is
so
calm
and
in
our
every
day
life
that
people
who
grew
up
to
the
ranks
of
a
union,
a
local
union
somewhere
in
the
south
or
wherever
it
might
be
and
accumulate
benefits
through
membership
and
he
is
promoting
in
the
supervision.
he
keeps
his
membership.
the
ruling
of
this
court
that
people
are
fired
simply
because
they
are
union
member,
not
for
participation
in
any
conduct
disloyal
to
an
employer,
but
simply
by
being
something.
by
belonging
to
something
would
in
effect
mean
that
the
employer
could
go
out
and
fire
everybody
that
was
a
member
of
a
union.
that’s
what
it
means.
now
in
a
teacher
situation,
in
a
teacher
situation
where
these
teachers
attempted
to
organize
in
the
north
carolina
area
for
example,
this
case
came
up
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
the
right
to
organize
and
under
the
first
amendment
of
course
if
the
state
said
no
or
the
county
as
this
case
might
be,
would
be
protected
under
first
amendment.
but
i
point
out
to
the
court
respectfully
that
to
be
a
union
member
is
not
what
14
(a)
is
to
protect
against
and
there
is
no
way
it
could
frustrate
federal
labor
policy
for
an
employee
or
person
who
has
got
a
right
to
work
and
arise
a
part
of
his
right
to
live,
go
take
a
job
or
signing
union
card
and
in
the
end
not
getting
fired
when
the
law
--
when
the
federal
labor
law
has
already
said
it
but
congress
said
that
we
could
do
it.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
that’s
correct
your
honor.
you
got
to
--
one
thing
i
point
out
to
the
court,
the
court
had
a
case
that
i
find
interesting
as
it
relates
to
this
situation
and
it
was
this,
this
case
called
u.s.
versus
robel.
and
i
am
sure
the
court
is
familiar
where
it
dealt
with
the
question
of
a
communist
who
had
applied
for
a
job
with
the
defense
department.
and
the
defense
department
had
a
regulation
or
some
policy
or
for
some
reason
he
was
not
hired
on
the
ground
that
his
interest
where
inimical
to
that
of
this
country
because
he
was
an
admitting
communist.
well,
there
the
court
pointed
out
and
i’d
like
to
quote
that
if
i
might
to
the
court.
the
court
said
this
that
“the
operative
fact
upon
which
the
job
disability
depends
is
the
exercise
of
an
individual’s
right
of
association
which
is
protected
by
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment.”
now
i
point
that
out
for
this
reason,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
congress
did
not
mean
in
its
enactment
of
14
(a)
that
people
should
be
entitled
even
if
they
are
a
supervisor
to
continue
to
be
able
to
join
a
union
and
it
didn’t
have
that
right.
surely
congress
in
the
status
of
the
law
in
1947
would
have
been
more
explicit
in
the
provisions
of
14
(a).
they
don’t
talk
about
membership
only
in
14
(a),
they
talk
about
membership
and
then
they
talk
about
collective
bargaining.
i
submit
when
they
talked
about
membership,
it
said
in
effect
that
if
supervisors
can
join
but
i
further
submit
if
the
supervisors
do
bond
together
and
try
enforcing
their
employer
to
recognize
them,
that’s
against
the
law
and
14
(a)
doesn’t
protect.
but
unless
an
employer
--
a
supervisor
is
disloyal
to
his
employer
and
the
employer
learns
of
that
disloyalty
in
more
respect
than
to
see
him
joining
an
organization,
he
is
certainly
entitled
to
some
protection
in
the
state
court.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor
there
was
--
this
situation
came
up
right
after
the
campaign
started.
there
was
no
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
i
think
it
absolutely
does.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
the
employer
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
i
certainly
agree
with
your
position
in
that
matter.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
he
at
that
point
in
my
judgment
could
take
the
position
if
you
--
if
your
union
contains
supervisors
working
for
me
i
am
not
going
to
bargain
with
it.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
think
so
too
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
would
fully
agree
with
that
position.
gentlemen
i
thank
you
very
much,
i
appreciate
the
time.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
think
they
are
engaging
in
union
activity
and
that
would
be
in
subordination
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
and
they
could
be
terminated.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
a
closer
question
but
i
still
think
it
would
be
giving
comfort
to
the
enemy
to
some
extent.
[voice
overlap]
and
i
think
the
employer
is
entitled
to
believe
that
his
supervision
would
not
participate
in
such
conduct
but
the
employer
owes
an
obligation
if
i
may
continue
to
explain
this
answer.
owes
an
obligation
to
his,
what
they
sometime
later
learn
to
be
supervisors
to
explain
to
the
supervisors
that,
look
if
we
have
a
union
campaign
you
are
a
supervisor.
you
see
in
this
particular
case,
you
got
to
remember
that
these
three
individuals,
they
just
walked
up
just
by
some
guy
said,
“here,
sign
this
card”
and
they
said
“okay,”
they
signed
it
then
they
have
a
hearing
on
the
election
petition
and
they
are
found
to
be
supervisors
and
that’s
all
the
evidence.
no
evidence
of
anything
else.
they
don’t
vote
in
election
and
the
day
after
the
election
they
get
fired.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
i
think
that
counts
in
an
appropriate
factual
context.
i
agree.
but
i
do
believe
that
an
employer
--
a
person
in
a
supervisory
position
is
not
anymore
entitled
or
any
less
entitled
to
look
after
his
own
interests
then
or
if
people
get
paid
by
hour,
i
don’t
see
any
distinction.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
sir
because
you
got
to
remember.
not
necessarily
you
see,
the
factual
context
in
which
this
always
comes
up,
would
generally
mean
where
an
employee
is
promoted
up
into
the
supervisory
class
and
being
a
member
as
an
employee
would
accumulate
certain
retirement
program
benefits
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
and
if
he
casts
his
membership
in
a
union,
he
is
going
to
lose
his
retirement
program
or
whatever
it
might
be.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no
but
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
but
the
reason
i
make
in
this
point
to
the
court
is
that
if
at
that
point
he
has
got
to
quit
or
be
fired
or
leave
the
union,
he
is
put
in
the
situation
of
having
to
give
up.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
play
the
court
rule
exactly
that.
your
honor,
i
think
that
that’s
the
whole
point
that
the
superior
court
be
asked
and
the
supreme
court
be
asked.
we
want
an
opportunity
to
try
this
case
on
these
merits.
if
it
proven
and
before
jury
or
before
the
court
that
these
three
plaintiffs
did
in
fact
sponsor
the
union,
went
out
and
got
people
to
sign
card.
travel
around
with
the
union
organizer
or
did
any
of
those
things
that
he
in
any
rights
no
matter
knows
it’s
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
employer.
if
it
provide,
he
knows
he
is
a
supervisor,
then
i
think
that
he
has
got
grounds
to
fire
man
because
the
man
should
owe
the
employer
some
loyalty.
but
i
don’t
--
i
think
in
the
status
of
this
case
right
now
you
got
a
situation
where
three
individuals
all
they
did
was
sign
this
card
and
i
think
people
have
a
right
to
do
that
sort
of
thing.
i
submit
to
the
court
to
the
constitution
in
the
law
and
this
common
sense
gives
us
the
right
to
do
that.
i
think
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
believe
the
employer
would
be
entitled
at
that
point
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
union.
so
long
as
they
kept
that
individual
member
of
the
union
which
represents
the
rank
and
file,
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
employer
would
have
every
right
at
that
point
to
refuse
the
bargaining
with
the
union.
i
think
that’s
exactly
what
14
(a)
says.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
don’t
care.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
don’t
believe
it
would
matter
you
honor
if
he
were
president
subject
to
the
president
making
their
life's
decision
in
the
company.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
contend,
as
i
understood
the
question
if
that
was
what
could
the
--
what
rights
did
the
company
have
at
that
point.
i
think
the
company
could
say,
look
to
the
supervisor
as
the
case
might
be.
i
believe
that
your
interest
in
belonging
to
the
union
of
the
rank
and
file
gave
me
grounds
to
not
recognize
this
union
and
bargain
with
it
from
our
rank
and
files.
and
i
think
14
(a)
clearly
says,
insofar
as
the
right
of
being
discharged,
if
the
evidence
says
that
all
he
did
was
join,
your
honor,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
they
would
have
to
say
to
him
more
then
or
prove
more
than
the
fact
that
he
just
--
like
these
men
did
sign
the
cards.
i
believe
it
takes
more
than
that.
because
i
believe
people
got
a
right
to
do
that.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
i
certainly
do
not.
i
certainly
submit
to
this
court
and
to
you,
your
honor
that
there
is
hardly
an
organizational
situation
where
there
is
organized
labor
in
this,
in
the
state
i
am
from
north
carolina,
or
in
any
other
state
which
--
at
which
supervisors
are
not
members
of
a
union,
one
or
more
and
in
any
sized
company.
not
necessary
to
get
bargaining
right
or
anything
like
that
because
they
came
up
through
the
work.
yes.
i
don’t
agree
that
being
a
member
of
a
union
is
inimical
to
being
loyal
to
my
employer.
i
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
on
to
be
heard
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
state
of
north
carolina.
simply,
it
involves
our
right-to-work
law
in
the
relationship
with
that
right-to-work
law
with
the
federal
substantive
and
the
federal
national
labor
relations
act.
a
factual
situation
is
one
where
three
individuals
who
were
employed
at
some
food
stores
in
north
carolina
were
terminated
right
after
a
union
election
that
was
conducted
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
our
right-to-work
law
provides
simply
that
in
north
carolina
a
person
who
has
a
right
to
live,
has
a
right
to
work
there
but
after
the
union
won
the
election,
these
three
individuals
was
fired.
and
it’s
our
position
simply
that
there
is
a
coexistence
as
possible
between
a
right-to-work
law
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
that
protects
supervisors
and
a
federal
law
which
protects
employees.
now,
the
case
is
dealing
with
the
right
of
people
that
belong
to
unions
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
constitutional
right
for
that
approach,
have
been
dealt
with
many
times
by
this
court.
first
of
all
in
the
morton
case
back
in
1940
--
tomas
v.
collins
in
1945,
the
court
stated
that
“union
membership
is
protected
by
the
right
of
association
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.”
well
what
that
meant
as
it
had
been
interpreted
later
was
as
true
so
long
as
you
know
government
interference.
in
other
words,
government
interference
came
in
if
you
have
the
right
to
association.
and
that
gave
rise
to
a
lot
of
cases
involving
people
excluded
from
coverage
on
the
national
labor
relations
act.
for
example
teachers,
policeman,
garbage
workers
and
a
lot
of
cases
they
have
extended
all
up
into
the
present
day
time.
well,
it's
our
position
simply
that
in
north
carolina
as
in
about
19
to
20
other
states,
we
have
a
law
that
says
one
of
the
group
of
people
and
that
is
supervisors
have
a
right
to
belong
to
a
union.
that
does
not
say
nor
does
our
law
say
that
a
company
or
an
employer
is
required
to
bargain
within
the
union
of
any
body
because
that’s
been
covered
by
the
federal
law.
there
is
no
credit.
it
simply
provides
that
everybody
in
north
carolina
has
a
right
to
belong
to
a
union
without
fear
of
being
fired.
now,
if
in
fact
this
case
is
preempted
or
the
state
law
is
preempted
by
federal
law
and
i
would
agree
with
the
defendant
and
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
the
state
courts
have
no
business
dealing
with.
but
it
is
really
our
position
that
this
court
in
1967,
in
the
hanna
case
has
already
answered
this
question.
we
submit
that
the
hanna
case
in
section
14
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
really
determines
and
answers
the
question
whether
or
not
a
supervisor
can
join
a
union
and
damages
for
his
discharge
because
of
his
union
membership
can
be
given
in
a
state
court.
and
that’s
the
question
we
have
here.
in
the
hanna
case,
the
court
dealt
with
section
14
(a)
and
i
would
like
for
the
court
if
i
might
to
point
out
all
of
the
words
of
14
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
it
reads
this
way
and
i
quote
“nothing
herein
shall
prohibit
any
individual
employed
as
a
supervisor
from
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
a
labor
organization.”
but
the
second
phrase
of
that
same
section
is
what
the
court
exactly
dealt
within
hanna
mining
company
that
such
statement
says,
“but
no
employer
subject
to
this
act
shall
be
compelled
to
deem
individuals
defined
herein
as
supervisors
as
employees
for
the
purpose
of
any
law,
either
national
or
local,
relating
to
collective
bargaining.”
now
the
point
i’m
making
by
reading
this
to
the
court
is
this.
first
of
all
congress
says
when
it
removes
supervisors
from
the
coverage
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
1947
by
the
taft-hartley
amendment,
supervisors
can
still
belong
to
union
but
no
longer
will
employers
be
required
to
bargain
collectively
with
unions
made
up
wholly
or
partially
a
supervisor.
now,
if
that
approach
is
maintained
under
the
federal
scheme
presently,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
conflict
with
our
right-to-work
law
and
a
protection
of
a
supervisor
and
the
federal
scheme
or
the
federal
law
is
passed
in
section
14
(a).
and
this
is
one,
in
1964
in
the
morton
case,
this
court
dealt
with
federal
preemption.
the
court
has
dealt
it
many
times
and
i
am
referring
to
case
as
generally
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
thank
you
very
much.
you
recall
just
before
the
luncheon
recess
i
quoted
to
you
a
quotation
from
the
case
called
tomas
v.
collins
which
provides
“union
membership
is
protected
by
the
right
of
association
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.”
that
was
the
1945
case
and
that
was
in
that
posture
of
the
situation
that
congress
chose
to
amend
the
wagner
act.
it
was
then
called
the
taft-hartley
amendment.
now,
i
think
it’s
reasonable
for
the
court
and
we
submit
to
the
court
if
reasonable
for
us
to
assume
that
congress
when
it
included
14
(a)
into
the
act,
it
had
some
reason
for
all
of
the
words
it
put
in
that
provision.
you
recall
what
i
read
to
you
just
before
the
recess
also
section
14
(a).
the
only
time,
i
confine
the
case
in
which
the
court
had
the
actual
situation
where
14
(a)
was
an
issue
is
the
case
called
hanna
mining
which
occurred
in
1965.
in
that
case,
the
court
talks
about
the
garmon
decision,
a
1959
decision
to
this
court
which
i’m
sure
the
court
deals
with
often
in
preemption
setting
out
in
effect
that
conduct
which
is
protected
or
by
section
7
or
prohibited
by
section
8
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
certainly
preempted
from
any
state
control.
but
in
that
case
and
then
the
hanna
case
mentions
that
there
may
be
some
other
areas
in
which
it
may
be
better
that
state
regulation
not
apply.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
one
quote
from
hanna
mining
which
raised
that
“the
grand
rules
for
preemption
in
the
labor
law
emerging
from
our
garmon
decision
that
the
case
that
is
mentioned
should
first
be
briefed
or
summarized.
in
general
a
state
may
not
regulate
conduct
arguably
protected
by
section
7
or
prohibited
by
section
8
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.”
well,
that’s
clear
and
it’s
been
clear
now
since
the
garmon
decision.
in
hanna
mining,
the
court
goes
on
to
point
out
“the
legislative
purpose
may
further
dictate
that
certain
activity,
neither
protected
nor
prohibited
be
deemed
privilege
against
state
regulation
and
continuing
for
the
reasons
that
follow,
we
believe
the
board’s
decision
that
hanna
engineers
are
supervisors
removed
from
this
case
most
of
the
opportunity
for
preemption.”
now
it
is
right
there
if
the
court
please
that
the
appellant
plaintiff
in
this
case
rests
its
position.
in
the
hanna
case,
the
court
dealt
with
a
situation
where
some
supervisory
engineers
were
attempting
to
picket,
to
obtain
a
recognition
from
an
employer.
the
employer
really
in
that
case
just
said,
“well,
i
don’t
believe
you
represent
a
true
majority.”
it
did
not
take
really
the
position
that
was
ended
up
to
start
with
but
in
that
situation
the
hanna
engineers
were
doing
exactly
what
the
last
part
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
says
says
“it
cannot
do.”
in
other
words
that
it
cannot,
no
employer
said
that
this
act
shall
be
compelled
to
treat
supervisors
as
employees
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining.
and
the
hanna
engineers
were
simply
trying
to
get
this
employer
to
do
exactly
that.
well,
in
the
hanna
case,
the
court
mentions
that
it’s
not
dealing
in
that
case
with
the
situation
where
a
person
could
become
a
supervisor
and
be
fired
for
being
a
union
member.
it
says
it’s
not
--
specifically
not
dealing
with
that
situation
and
this
court
did.
well,
the
situation
we
have
before
this
court
right
now
is
the
one
the
court
in
hanna
said
it
wasn't
going
to
deal
within
that
case.
in
1967,
a
case
called
u.s.
versus
morton
before
this
court
pointed
out
that
--
or
teamster
local
versus
morton,
this
is
in
377
u.s.,
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
preemption
1964,
i’m
sorry,
it
says
to
explain
the
preemption
doctrine
further
“the
answer
to
that
question
ultimately
depends
upon
whether
the
application
of
state
law
in
this
kind
of
case
would
operate
to
frustrate
the
purpose
of
the
federal
legislation.”
now,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
in
light
of
hanna,
the
hanna
case
and
in
light
of
the
statement
in
the
morton
case
explaining
what
is
and
what
isn’t
preempted
that
the
activity
of
these
three
individuals
who
signed
membership
cards
to
the
union
and
were
fired
as
a
result
thereof
is
not
the
kind
of
activity
if
regulated
by
the
states
would
frustrate
the
national
labor
policy.
in
the
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
your
honor.
in
this
--
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
case,
the
court
simply
ruled
in
that
decision
that
this
matter
is
preempted
by
federal
law
and
that
was
the
basis
of
their
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
it
rose
specifically
in
citing
hanna
and
other
decisions
that
he
had
not
been
preempted
and
the
supreme
court
would
reverse
but
it
relied
primarily
on
hanna
mining
in
reversing
the
court’s
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now
i
submit
to
the
court
that
hanna
mining
simply
says,
“here
is
a
state
court
trying
to
enjoin
conduct
being
engaged
in
by
some
supervisors”
which
the
national
labor
relations
act
says
“cannot
be
done.”
the
employer
is
not
required
to
countenance,
this
kind
of
conduct.
and
therefore
when
the
state
court
attempted
to
enjoin
it,
this
court
said
that’s
okay.
you
can
enjoin
that
kind
of
conduct
because
it
does
not
in
that
kind
of
application
of
state
law
frustrate
the
national
labor
policy.
well,
we
are
asking
the
court
in
this
instance
simply
to
rule,
if
congress
meant
anything
when
it
put
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
of
14
(a)
in
there
“nothing
herein
shall
prohibit
any
individual
employed
as
a
supervisor
from
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
a
labor
organization”
to
treat
the
first
half
of
that
sentence
the
same
way.
meaning
in
effect
if
people
have
a
right
to
belong
to
a
union
as
congress
has
said,
then
how
can
the
provision
for
damages
in
a
state
court
which
only
comes
into
play
if
this
people
are
not
allowed
to
exercise
that
right
frustrate
a
national
labor
policy?
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir.
we
have
a
--
does
the
supervisors
have
a
right
to
organize?
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no
sir,
that
is
i
submit
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
for
simply
signing
union
card.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir.
that’s
all
the
complain
alleged
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
yes
sir
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
organization
includes
much
more
than
just
joining
a
union.
there
are
many
situations
in
actual
life
where
frequently
people
are
members
of
a
union
where
they
don’t
even
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you
your
honor
for
this
reason
if
i
might
explain.
the
reason
i
disagree
with
you
is
this,
i
think
that
14
(a)
the
second
phrase
of
14
(a)
covers
organizing,
yes
sir.
but
i
think
it
also
permits
the
joining
of
a
union
by
one
individual
or
more
individuals
for
that
matter.
so
long
as
there
is
no
effort
on
their
part
to
go
through
the
processes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
calling
for
recognition
or
through
some
action
like
was
done
in
the
hanna
case.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
we
were
specifically
told
by
the
nlrb
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir
we
filed
charges.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
sir.
we
filed
charges
alleging
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
1
and
that
these
--
these
charges
--
they
got
caught
in
the
old
situation
dealing
with
firing
of
supervisors
to
coerce
the
employees
covered
by
the
act
and
they’re
not
participating
in
the
union.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
that
was
our
theory
before
the
nlrb.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
from
discouraging
the
employees
your
honor
as
opposed
to
anybody
else.
remember
the
act
covers
only
employees
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
they
said
--
they
clearly
said
that
and
that
was
a
decision
of
the
general
counsel.
mr.
nash
when
he
contacted
me
and
mr.
stockton
for
the
company.
the
wording
of
the
letter
was
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir.
now,
the
situation
is
one
where
--
it
is
simple
for
everybody
who
has
filed
briefs
in
this
case
except
us
seems
to
put
a
union
activity
or
organizing
and
the
signing
of
a
union
card
or
joining
a
union
into
the
same
board
it
isn’t.
i
submit
to
the
court
it
isn’t
the
same
thing.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
we
submit
if
they
were
your
honor
it
will
be
preempted
and
we
agree
with
your
position
but
we
certainly
say,
if
it
were
one
relating
to
collective
bargaining
it
would
certainly
be
preempted
because
of
14
(a)
in
the
second
half
for
that
sentence
says,
“you
can’t
require
an
employer
to
recognize
that
kind
of
situation
and
we
agree
with
that
and
with
all
the
cases
relied
on
by
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
holding
against
us
or
in
reversing
the
court
of
appeals
we
agree
with.
we
agree
with
hanna
mining,
we
agree
with
--
and
the
cases
which
spell
out
the
preemption
doctrine
and
what
is
precluded
from
state
jurisdiction
and
what
is
allowable.
you
recall
in
hanna
that
this
court
said
in
hanna
that
that
state
court
since
its
enjoining
on
conduct
that
14
(a)
says
that
supervisors
can
engage
in
therefore
does
not
frustrate
state
law.
i
mean
federal
labor
legislation
of
federal
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
that’s
what
the
court’s
position
was
your
honor
but
even
the
board
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes
sir.
it
is.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
well,
your
honor
that’s
what
the
state
court
as
i
understood
it
said
your
honor
and
that’s
why
i
so
vehemently
disagree
with
because
even
if
you
will
come
into
the
case
called
(inaudible)
which
i
believe
--
and
it
involved
one
of
these
situations
where
a
supervisor
was
fired
because
he
was
told
to
go
out
and
engage
in
some
unlawful
conduct
on
part
of
his
employer
and
he
said,
“i
am
not
going
to
do
it”
and
the
employer
said
“well,
if
you
don’t
do
it
i
will
fire
you,”
and
he
wouldn’t
do
it
so
he
got
fired
and
the
case
went
up
through
the
board
and
it
was
ended
up
to
the
situation
that
the
board
ruled
and
was
supported
by
enforcement
that
that
really
coerced
employees
who
were
covered
by
the
act
and
by
firing
a
supervisor
who
was
being
in
an
effort
to
coerce
employees
we
feel
that
situation
is
covered
by
8
(a)
1
of
the
act
and
i
agree
fully.
but
in
so
--
if
the
employer
sits
and
contends
to
this
court
and
us
and
through
all
the
courts
that
have
gone
before
that,
look,
an
employer
should
have
an
absolute
right
to
fire
a
supervisor.
and
that’s
what
i
want
to
address
this
remark
to.
now,
i
remember
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
one
of
the
justices
asked
me
and
the
question,
“look,
this
means
that
anybody
can
be
a
union
member.
this
even
means
that
a
manger
could
be
a
union
member.”
well
i
submit
to
the
court,
they
can
be
and
it
doesn’t
mean
that
disloyalty.
somebody
is
so
calm
and
in
our
every
day
life
that
people
who
grew
up
to
the
ranks
of
a
union,
a
local
union
somewhere
in
the
south
or
wherever
it
might
be
and
accumulate
benefits
through
membership
and
he
is
promoting
in
the
supervision.
he
keeps
his
membership.
the
ruling
of
this
court
that
people
are
fired
simply
because
they
are
union
member,
not
for
participation
in
any
conduct
disloyal
to
an
employer,
but
simply
by
being
something.
by
belonging
to
something
would
in
effect
mean
that
the
employer
could
go
out
and
fire
everybody
that
was
a
member
of
a
union.
that’s
what
it
means.
now
in
a
teacher
situation,
in
a
teacher
situation
where
these
teachers
attempted
to
organize
in
the
north
carolina
area
for
example,
this
case
came
up
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
the
right
to
organize
and
under
the
first
amendment
of
course
if
the
state
said
no
or
the
county
as
this
case
might
be,
would
be
protected
under
first
amendment.
but
i
point
out
to
the
court
respectfully
that
to
be
a
union
member
is
not
what
14
(a)
is
to
protect
against
and
there
is
no
way
it
could
frustrate
federal
labor
policy
for
an
employee
or
person
who
has
got
a
right
to
work
and
arise
a
part
of
his
right
to
live,
go
take
a
job
or
signing
union
card
and
in
the
end
not
getting
fired
when
the
law
--
when
the
federal
labor
law
has
already
said
it
but
congress
said
that
we
could
do
it.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
that’s
correct
your
honor.
you
got
to
--
one
thing
i
point
out
to
the
court,
the
court
had
a
case
that
i
find
interesting
as
it
relates
to
this
situation
and
it
was
this,
this
case
called
u.s.
versus
robel.
and
i
am
sure
the
court
is
familiar
where
it
dealt
with
the
question
of
a
communist
who
had
applied
for
a
job
with
the
defense
department.
and
the
defense
department
had
a
regulation
or
some
policy
or
for
some
reason
he
was
not
hired
on
the
ground
that
his
interest
where
inimical
to
that
of
this
country
because
he
was
an
admitting
communist.
well,
there
the
court
pointed
out
and
i’d
like
to
quote
that
if
i
might
to
the
court.
the
court
said
this
that
“the
operative
fact
upon
which
the
job
disability
depends
is
the
exercise
of
an
individual’s
right
of
association
which
is
protected
by
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment.”
now
i
point
that
out
for
this
reason,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
congress
did
not
mean
in
its
enactment
of
14
(a)
that
people
should
be
entitled
even
if
they
are
a
supervisor
to
continue
to
be
able
to
join
a
union
and
it
didn’t
have
that
right.
surely
congress
in
the
status
of
the
law
in
1947
would
have
been
more
explicit
in
the
provisions
of
14
(a).
they
don’t
talk
about
membership
only
in
14
(a),
they
talk
about
membership
and
then
they
talk
about
collective
bargaining.
i
submit
when
they
talked
about
membership,
it
said
in
effect
that
if
supervisors
can
join
but
i
further
submit
if
the
supervisors
do
bond
together
and
try
enforcing
their
employer
to
recognize
them,
that’s
against
the
law
and
14
(a)
doesn’t
protect.
but
unless
an
employer
--
a
supervisor
is
disloyal
to
his
employer
and
the
employer
learns
of
that
disloyalty
in
more
respect
than
to
see
him
joining
an
organization,
he
is
certainly
entitled
to
some
protection
in
the
state
court.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor
there
was
--
this
situation
came
up
right
after
the
campaign
started.
there
was
no
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
i
think
it
absolutely
does.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
the
employer
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
i
certainly
agree
with
your
position
in
that
matter.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
he
at
that
point
in
my
judgment
could
take
the
position
if
you
--
if
your
union
contains
supervisors
working
for
me
i
am
not
going
to
bargain
with
it.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
think
so
too
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
would
fully
agree
with
that
position.
gentlemen
i
thank
you
very
much,
i
appreciate
the
time.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
think
they
are
engaging
in
union
activity
and
that
would
be
in
subordination
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
and
they
could
be
terminated.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
a
closer
question
but
i
still
think
it
would
be
giving
comfort
to
the
enemy
to
some
extent.
[voice
overlap]
and
i
think
the
employer
is
entitled
to
believe
that
his
supervision
would
not
participate
in
such
conduct
but
the
employer
owes
an
obligation
if
i
may
continue
to
explain
this
answer.
owes
an
obligation
to
his,
what
they
sometime
later
learn
to
be
supervisors
to
explain
to
the
supervisors
that,
look
if
we
have
a
union
campaign
you
are
a
supervisor.
you
see
in
this
particular
case,
you
got
to
remember
that
these
three
individuals,
they
just
walked
up
just
by
some
guy
said,
“here,
sign
this
card”
and
they
said
“okay,”
they
signed
it
then
they
have
a
hearing
on
the
election
petition
and
they
are
found
to
be
supervisors
and
that’s
all
the
evidence.
no
evidence
of
anything
else.
they
don’t
vote
in
election
and
the
day
after
the
election
they
get
fired.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
i
think
that
counts
in
an
appropriate
factual
context.
i
agree.
but
i
do
believe
that
an
employer
--
a
person
in
a
supervisory
position
is
not
anymore
entitled
or
any
less
entitled
to
look
after
his
own
interests
then
or
if
people
get
paid
by
hour,
i
don’t
see
any
distinction.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
sir
because
you
got
to
remember.
not
necessarily
you
see,
the
factual
context
in
which
this
always
comes
up,
would
generally
mean
where
an
employee
is
promoted
up
into
the
supervisory
class
and
being
a
member
as
an
employee
would
accumulate
certain
retirement
program
benefits
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
and
if
he
casts
his
membership
in
a
union,
he
is
going
to
lose
his
retirement
program
or
whatever
it
might
be.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no
but
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
but
the
reason
i
make
in
this
point
to
the
court
is
that
if
at
that
point
he
has
got
to
quit
or
be
fired
or
leave
the
union,
he
is
put
in
the
situation
of
having
to
give
up.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
play
the
court
rule
exactly
that.
your
honor,
i
think
that
that’s
the
whole
point
that
the
superior
court
be
asked
and
the
supreme
court
be
asked.
we
want
an
opportunity
to
try
this
case
on
these
merits.
if
it
proven
and
before
jury
or
before
the
court
that
these
three
plaintiffs
did
in
fact
sponsor
the
union,
went
out
and
got
people
to
sign
card.
travel
around
with
the
union
organizer
or
did
any
of
those
things
that
he
in
any
rights
no
matter
knows
it’s
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
employer.
if
it
provide,
he
knows
he
is
a
supervisor,
then
i
think
that
he
has
got
grounds
to
fire
man
because
the
man
should
owe
the
employer
some
loyalty.
but
i
don’t
--
i
think
in
the
status
of
this
case
right
now
you
got
a
situation
where
three
individuals
all
they
did
was
sign
this
card
and
i
think
people
have
a
right
to
do
that
sort
of
thing.
i
submit
to
the
court
to
the
constitution
in
the
law
and
this
common
sense
gives
us
the
right
to
do
that.
i
think
--
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
believe
the
employer
would
be
entitled
at
that
point
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
union.
so
long
as
they
kept
that
individual
member
of
the
union
which
represents
the
rank
and
file,
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
employer
would
have
every
right
at
that
point
to
refuse
the
bargaining
with
the
union.
i
think
that’s
exactly
what
14
(a)
says.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
don’t
care.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
i
don’t
believe
it
would
matter
you
honor
if
he
were
president
subject
to
the
president
making
their
life's
decision
in
the
company.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
contend,
as
i
understood
the
question
if
that
was
what
could
the
--
what
rights
did
the
company
have
at
that
point.
i
think
the
company
could
say,
look
to
the
supervisor
as
the
case
might
be.
i
believe
that
your
interest
in
belonging
to
the
union
of
the
rank
and
file
gave
me
grounds
to
not
recognize
this
union
and
bargain
with
it
from
our
rank
and
files.
and
i
think
14
(a)
clearly
says,
insofar
as
the
right
of
being
discharged,
if
the
evidence
says
that
all
he
did
was
join,
your
honor,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
they
would
have
to
say
to
him
more
then
or
prove
more
than
the
fact
that
he
just
--
like
these
men
did
sign
the
cards.
i
believe
it
takes
more
than
that.
because
i
believe
people
got
a
right
to
do
that.
mr.
larry
l.
eubanks
your
honor,
i
certainly
do
not.
i
certainly
submit
to
this
court
and
to
you,
your
honor
that
there
is
hardly
an
organizational
situation
where
there
is
organized
labor
in
this,
in
the
state
i
am
from
north
carolina,
or
in
any
other
state
which
--
at
which
supervisors
are
not
members
of
a
union,
one
or
more
and
in
any
sized
company.
not
necessary
to
get
bargaining
right
or
anything
like
that
because
they
came
up
through
the
work.
yes.
i
don’t
agree
that
being
a
member
of
a
union
is
inimical
to
being
loyal
to
my
employer.
i
thank
you
very
much.
