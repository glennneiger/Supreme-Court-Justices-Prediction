mr.

continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
eubanks.
mr.
stockton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
count
the
ballot
of
the
supervisor
when
they
came
to
an
election
on
the
union?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
take
it,
you’re
relating
their
acts,
the
supervisor’s
acts
to
union
activity
is
narrowed
down
to
the
proposition
that
when
the
foreman
or
other
supervisor
joins
the
union,
he
maybe
giving
--
aiding
comfort
to
the
union
and
indicating
an
employer
attitude
in
favor
of
the
union
as
far
as
the
other
employees
are
concerned.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
have
it
finished.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
the
posture
of
a
foreman,
these
particular
men,
supervisors,
if
a
strike
were
called,
what
would
be
their
obligations
with
respect
to
the
picket
line?
most
unions
have
a
penalty
for
a
member
who
crosses
a
picket
line.
would
these
supervisors
be
subject
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
sure
i
got
fully
your
response
to
the
posture
of
the
business
of
the
supervisors
in
case
of
a
strike.
what
about
the
picket
line?
if
they
crossed
that
they’d
be
fired
from
the
union
probably,
wouldn’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
--
or
and
they
might
be
subject
to
penalties
from
the
union
if
the
union
provided
for
the
less
--
as
they
generally
do.
do
you
say
that’s
a
conflict
with
the
employer’s
interest
to
have
a
supervisor
who
is
in
that
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
eubanks,
do
you
have
anything
further?
let
me
begin
by
putting
a
question
to
you.
suppose
the
supervisors
at
the
time
the
organization
activity
began,
went
around
to
the
employees
with
cards
asking
employees
to
sign.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let’s
take
it
one
step
per
move,
suppose
the
supervisors
just
go
around
with
the
union
business
agent,
stand
there
and
say
nothing
while
they
are
soliciting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
you
concede
that
any
activity
which
could
be
regarded
as
aiding
and
assisting
the
union
campaign
would
be
grounds
for
dismissal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
the
remedy
there
is
to
join
a
union
of
supervisors,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that’s
not
our
case
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
right
here,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
don’t
we
have
an
unresolved,
possibly,
an
unresolved
factual
question
here
namely
whether
the
conduct
of
these
supervisors
in
whatever
they
may
have
done,
signing
the
card
and
talking
to
people,
whatever,
whether
that
constituted
aiding
and
assisting
the
union’s
organization
campaign.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief

disposition
of
