justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
first,
the
beasley
case,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
held
that
supervisors
discharged
for
union
membership,
could
not
sue
their
employer
for
damages
under
a
state
statute,
creating
a
right
or
action
for
damages
for
persons
discharged
for
union
membership.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
held
that
the
enforcement
of
the
state
law
in
favor
of
discharged
supervisors
was
barred
by
a
provision
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
that
provides,
“no
employer
shall
be
compelled
to
being
supervisors
as
employees
for
the
purpose
of
any
law,
even
national
or
local,
relating
to
collective
bargains.”
we
agree
with
the
holding
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
and
unanimously
affirm.
