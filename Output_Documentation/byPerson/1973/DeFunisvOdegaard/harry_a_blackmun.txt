justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
mr.
defunis
still
in
law
school?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
does
your
last
quarter
or
semester
begin?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
so
he
will
graduate
this
spring
presumably?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
diamond,
if
he
does
graduate
and
if
this
decision
of
the
washington
court
is
affirmed,
will
he
nevertheless
be
eligible
to
take
the
washington
bar
examination
even
though
your
supreme
court
has
said
he
has
been
illegally
in
law
school?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
that
in
and
of
itself
doesn’t
prove
that.
what
is
the
percentage
of
the
others?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
3
out
of
13
is
20
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
substantially
more
than
92%.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general,
i
think
you
haven’t
told
us
who
has
formulated
this
precise
policy?
is
it
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
you
say
the
law
school
itself,
you
mean
the
dean
or
the
admissions
committee
or
the
faculty,
who?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
how
many
are
on
the
admissions
committee?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
two
students?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
do
have
some
who
are
not
members
of
the
faculty,
although
just
now
you
said
it
was
the
faculty
that
set
the
policy
for
the
school.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
these
students,
how
far
along
in
their
law
school
careers?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
they’re
passing
on
the
admission
of
the
next
succeeding
class.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
one
denial
vote
on
the
committee
would
keep
a
person
out.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
no
one
was
admitted
without
the
approval
of
all
members
of
the
committee?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you’re
speaking
in
terms
of
viewing
it.
one
can
view
it
and
vote
negatively.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
i’m
trying
to
find
out
is,
how
is
a
person
denied
admission,
by
vote?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes
i
understand.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
a
majority
vote?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
the
students
do
vote
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
their
successors
in
the
next
class.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
made
the
statement
a
while
ago
that
the
law
school
was
a
national
school.
do
you
charge
non-residents
more
tuition
than
washington
residents?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
to
that
extent,
it
is
something
less
than
a
national
law
school?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
certainly,
it
discourages
non-residents
from
coming,
doesn’t
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
diamond.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
chief
justice
will
permit
me
with
the
red
light
on.
let
me
get
away
from
this
racial
aspect
a
little
bit.
let’s
speak
of
our
sister
profession
of
medicine,
in
which
i
have
a
little
familiarity
in
the
past.
there’s
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
need
for
general
practitioners
and
the
need
for
newly
trained
physicians
to
get
out
into
small
communities.
suppose
in
the
university
of
washington
law
--
medical
school,
there
were
some
applicants
who
said
“i
would
like
to
go
into
the
mountains
or
into
the
dessert
or
wherever
it
is,
[laughter]
and
i’m
not
desire
as
to
specialize
in
orthopedics
or
neurosurgery.
i
just
want
to
be
a
general
practitioner.”
and
yet,
his
qualification
is
undergraduate
work
and
grade-wise
was
less
than
a
number
of
others
who
wanted
to
specialize.
do
you
think
this
factor,
whether
it’s
valid
or
not
as
a
matter
of
medical
concern,
but
today
it
is
assumed
to
be
i
think,
do
you
think
this
factor
of
the
need
for
general
practitioners
and
the
desire
for
general
practitioners
would
be
something
that
the
admissions
committee
of
the
medical
school
could
validly
take
into
consideration?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
my
question
was
an
attempt
to
get
away
from
race.
it
was
an
attempt
to
focus
on
the
need
of
the
community,
not
on
the
qualifications,
particularly
of
the
applicant.
i
take
it
you
feel
that
they
could
not
take
this
into
consideration.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
mr.
defunis
