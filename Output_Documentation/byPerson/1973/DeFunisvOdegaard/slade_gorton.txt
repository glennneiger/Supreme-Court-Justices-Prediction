mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
vary
from
my
opening
argument
only
in
connection
with
one
of
the
questions
which
obviously
bothers
this
court
as
to
the
status
of
the
case
itself
and
that
relates
to
whether
or
not
it
is
moot.
we
think
it
is
not
moot,
though
such
a
decision
on
your
part
obviously
would
reinstate
the
state
supreme
court
decision
and
vindicate
our
program.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
defunis
will
enter
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
will,
at
least
as
far
as
this
group
is
that
--
students
are
concerned
subject
to
some
further
challenge
--
mr.
slade
gorton
if
you
found
it
moot
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
already
graduated,
mr.
justice
brennan,
or
were
about
to
graduate?
mr.
slade
gorton
i
suppose
the
original
action
might
have
dismissed
--
might
have
simply
been
dismissed.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
would
validate
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
might
very
well.
that
would
validate
our
program.
in
any
event
--
mr.
slade
gorton
for
the
past.
mr.
slade
gorton
until
someone
else
brought
another
challenge
and
came
back
here,
probably
under
the
same
circumstances
which
is
the
principal
ground
on
which
we
regard
the
case
not
as
being
moot.
as
far
as
mr.
defunis
is
concerned,
the
time
for
registration
for
the
final
quarter
of
his
law
school
began
on
february
20,
it
ends
on
march
1,
the
day
after
tomorrow.
on
thursday,
when
we
left,
he
had
picked
up
his
application
forms.
he
may
or
may
not,
mr.
justice
marshall,
have
filed
them.
he
certainly
will
have
by
friday.
he
would
--
even
if
he
had
been
required
to
ask
readmission,
he
would
have
been
granted
that
readmission
assuming
that
he
was
acceptably
performing
his
law
school
studies,
which
he
is.
he
is
not
law
review,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he’s
roughly
in
the
middle
of
his
class.
once
he
has
registered
on
the
--
no
later
than
the
first
of
march,
there
will
be
--
he
will
then
complete
his
law
school
studies
assuming
he
passes
his
courses
in
the
last
semester.
the
only
discretion
which
would
then
remain
in
the
law
school
would
be
if
he
failed
a
course
in
his
last
semester
and
requested
special
permission
to
come
back
in
the
fall
to
make
up
for
it,
in
which
case
of
course
he’d
be
in
exactly
the
position
as
any
other
student
who
had
failed
would
be.
mr.
slade
gorton
nothing.
he
would
--
assuming
he
passes
his
courses,
he
would
receive
his
degree
and
he
would
take
his
bar
examination.
it
is
not
correct
to
characterize
the
state
supreme
court’s
decision
as
saying
he
was
illegally
in
law
school.
the
state
supreme
court
decision
said
the
program
of
admissions
adopted
by
the
law
school
was
valid,
and
that
he
was
not
deprived
of
equal
protection.
it
did
not
order
us
to
take
him
out
of
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
suspect
that
they
have
probably
rested
on
their
rights
too
long
at
this
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
university
of
washington
law
school
has
selected
its
limited
number
of
students
from
a
large
pool
of
clearly
qualified
candidates.
the
considerations
employed
in
the
difficult,
but
necessary
choice
between
applicants
have
included,
among
several
other
factors,
that
of
the
race
of
those
applicants.
one
goal
of
that
policy
has
been
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
education
of
all
law
students
by
better
preparing
them
to
practice
law
in
a
pluralistic
society.
24
years
ago,
this
court
said
the
law
school,
the
proving
ground
for
legal
learning
and
practice,
cannot
be
effective
in
isolation
from
the
individuals
and
institutions
with
which
the
law
interacts.
a
related
goal
has
been
the
improvement
of
the
entire
legal
profession
by
helping
it
better
to
reflect
and
to
understand
and
to
represent
all
elements
in
the
pluralistic
society
in
which
the
bar
plays
so
important
of
a
role.
this
system
of
law
school
admissions
is
not
unique
or
isolated
to
the
university
of
washington.
with
minor
variations,
it
is
the
system
used
by
a
wide
range
of
american
law
schools,
many
of
whom
have
joined
in
briefs
in
its
defense.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
does
not,
mr.
justice
douglas,
of
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
not.
the
bar
examination
in
the
state
of
washington
is
entirely
anonymous
as
to
every
person
who
takes
it
and
entirely
neutral
as
to
race.
i
can
say,
however,
that
10
of
the
13
members
of
these
4
minority
groups
who
were
in
the
class
of
1973
in
law
school
passed
the
july
1973
bar
examination.
so,
they
were
obviously
qualified
without
any
regard
to
race
whatsoever,
though
i
suspect
their
so-called
predicted
averages
were
much
lower.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
percentage
of
all,
last
year,
was
extraordinary,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
was
92%.
so
that
the
percentage
of
the
minority
students
was
slightly
lower,
but
it
still
was
very
highly
successful.
mr.
slade
gorton
21%,
something
like
that.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
difference
between
92
and
79.
it
still
is
quite
a
high
success
rate.
i
mean,
of
course,
you
get
more
than
one
crack
at
the
bar
examination
there.
mr.
slade
gorton
a
tremendous
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
in
the
sense
that
the
law
school
and
the
university
itself
has
recognized
their
almost
total
exclusion
from
the
bar
in
the
society
as
a
whole
and
in
the
state
of
washington.
one
of
the
major
elements
in
the
record
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
dr.
odegaard’s
testimony
to
exactly
that
extent.
actually
here,
in
the
name
of
equal
protection,
this
petitioner
asks
you
to
return
us
to
a
system
of
law
school
student
selection
which
at
the
university
of
washington,
which
has
never
engaged
in
racial
discrimination,
by
force
of
law,
only
produced
12
black
graduates
out
of
3,812
between
1902
and
1969.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
don’t
believe
we
do,
your
honor.
they
applied
in
very
small
numbers.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
i
think
it
is
probable,
but
i
can’t
prove
that
they
applied
in
somewhat
larger
numbers
than
they
were
admitted,
because
in
this
particular
case,
if
you
followed
the
guidelines
which
the
petitioner
has
asked
you
to
follow,
we
would’ve
had
an
absolutely
white
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
a
black
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
a
black
judge
of
the
superior
court
who
was
appointed
just
last
month
in
seattle.
those
are
all
in
court’s
record.
there
are
also
justice
court
judges.
yes,
just
two
in
the
state.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
do
not,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
feel
that
way.
your
statistic
is
accurate
and
it
is
matched
in
connection
with
the
chicano
population
of
the
state,
and
i
do
not
for
three
reasons;
first
the
university
of
washington
is
a
national
law
school.
it
is
not
limited
to
the
state
of
washington.
second,
the
goal
of
this
policy
was
an
educational
goal.
it
wished
to
have
a
sufficient
variety
of
students
in
the
law
school
so
that
their
own
educational
experience
which,
as
you
well
know,
is
largely,
at
least
in
discussions
among
students,
would
be
broadened
and
so
that
the
outlook
of
the
white
students
as
well
as
of
the
minority
students
would
be
more
understanding.
it's
goal
was
also
to
see
to
it
that
the
bar
had
that
same
advantage
of
representing
all
the
classes
and
groups
in
society
in
the
state
of
washington
and
simply
to
fix
some
kind
of
quota-based
precisely
on
state
population
would
meet
neither
of
those
goals.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
there
are
similar
policies
in
other
schools
of
the
university
but
i
cannot
describe
them
in
the
detail
which
i
can
describe
the
one
as
the
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
not,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
am
promoting
here
equal
opportunity
on
the
basis
--
mr.
slade
gorton
alright,
but
we
are
not
--
we
do
not
operate
such
a
system
and
we
are
not
asking
you
to
validate
such
a
system.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
statistical
judgments
or
the
statistical
scores
which
are
used
in
connection
with
law
school
admissions
are
not
invariable
and
totally
accurate
predictors
of
success
nor
do
they
solve
the
problem
of
ending
the
effects
of
racial
discrimination.
in
this
particular
case,
we’re
dealing
with
a
student
who
was
only
marginally
qualified
when
he
was
compared
with
all
of
the
people
who
were
admitted
into
the
school.
there
were
1,601
applications.
most
of
them
were
qualified
people.
330
were
eventually
given
letters
or
notices
of
admission.
on
predicted
first
year
averages,
mr.
defunis
ranked
about
290th
in
that
group
of
330.
a
number
of
people
above
him
were
denied
admission.
a
number
of
people
below
him
were
given
admission.
had
we
picked
the
top
330
and
students
simply
on
the
basis
of
predicted
first
year
average,
one
minority
person
would
have
been
among
it
and
he
didn’t
enter
the
school,
and
we
would’ve
had
a
lily
white
school.
we
might
have
been
subject
to
a
challenge
on
the
basis
that
we
were
deliberately
discriminatory.
we
did
give
notice
to
these
students
that
other
matters
except
for
law
school
admission
test
scores
and
grades
were
counted
in
connection
with
law
school.
you
have
it
on
page
8
of
our
brief.
each
student,
before
he
applied,
received
a
notification,
three
paragraphs
of
which
are
quoted
on
page
8
which
says,
in
the
last
paragraph,
“we
gave
no
preference
to,
but
did
not
discriminate
against
either
washington
residents
or
women
in
making
our
determination,
and
applicant’s
racial
or
ethnic
background
was
considered
as
one
factor
in
our
general
attempt
to
convert
formal
credentials
into
realistic
predictions.
this
is
precisely
what
the
law
school
did.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
i
think
it
was
a
matter
of
considerable
interest
here,
and
i
think
it
may
have
been
somewhat
misstated
by
petitioner,
but
it
does
not.
what
matters
here
is
whether
or
not
the
law
school
admissions
policy
was
based
on
appropriate
educational
judgments
on
the
part
of
the
law
school
itself.
obviously,
neither
mr.
defunis
nor
any
other
individual
had
a
constitutional
right
to
enter
the
university
of
washington
law
school.
that
was
impossible.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
that
it
is,
mr.
justice
white,
as
long
as
it
is
relatively
narrowly
conceived,
remember
to
gain
--
mr.
slade
gorton
alright.
mr.
slade
gorton
let
me
answer
the
question
more
precisely.
we
feel
that,
in
connection
with
these
particular
minorities,
the
fact
of
discrimination
against
them
in
our
society
over
literally
hundreds
of
years
has
had
a
very
real
effect.
it
means
that
fewer
of
them
actually
graduate
from
college
by
percentage
than
other
groups
in
our
society.
it
means
those
who
do
frequently
have
lower
grade
points,
and
certainly
have
shown
up
with
lower
law
school
admissions
test
scores.
so
that
if
we
used
only
these
mathematical
determinants
of
admission
for
law
school,
we
would
continue
to
exclude
them.
we
didn’t
admit
any
of
them
who
were
not
qualified.
i
think
this
is
vitally
important.
even
on
a
statistical
basis,
coupled
with
other
background
items
not
related
to
race
at
all,
they
were
qualified
and
they’ve
shown
themselves
to
be
qualified.
mr.
slade
gorton
neither
of
those
assumptions
are
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
were
not
considered
separately,
except
on
the
same
kind
of
preliminary
basis
that
everyone
was
considered
separately.
all
of
the
people,
other
than
those
who
were
of
such
high
intellectual
attainments
that
they
received
almost
immediate
admission
after
their
applications
came
in,
were
considered
by
an
individual
member
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
not
true
either,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
even
beyond
veterans.
there
were
--
there
was
the
ability
on
the
part
of
the
dean
of
admissions
to
say
that
he
felt
there
were
factors
involved
in
a
particular
application
of
a
white
non-veteran
with
a
pfya
of
below
74.5
which
would
cause
him
to
be
considered
by
the
entire
admissions
committee.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
did
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
was
clearly
a
difference
in
treatment,
but
it
was
a
difference
in
treatment
which
was
required
by
the
admissions
policy
which,
of
course,
was
based
on
the
particular
educational
and
professional
rules
which
the
university
adopted.
however,
remember
that
large
numbers
of
the
members
of
these
minority
groups
were
in
fact
excluded
from
law
school.
there
was
--
they
had
to
have
a
predicted
first
year
average
either
alone
or
coupled
with
other
precise
academic
qualifications
which
would
indicate
that
they
could
successfully
complete
a
law
school
education.
if,
for
example,
one
of
them
came
in
with
a
pfya
of
59
where
the
lowest
passing
grade
in
law
school
is
68,
he
would
not
have
been
admitted.
very
few
were
admitted
below
68
and,
only
in
those
cases
where
something
else
indicated
that
they
could
actually
attain
a
68
or
better
average.
now,
we
were
faced
with
a
situation,
all
of
society
was
faced
with
a
situation
in
connection
with
particular
minorities
who’ve
been
the
subject
of
discrimination
in
the
past
which
could
not
be
cured
by
a
simple
application
of
a
number
of
statistical
formulae.
if
we
were
to
continue
the
old
system,
we
would’ve
continued
the
old
method
of
not
having
these
minority
groups
represented
in
law
school.
moreover,
this
particular
program
is,
in
effect,
self-liquidating.
as
the
effects
of
discrimination
lessened
or
seized,
presumably
more
of
these
minorities
will
graduate
from
college.
they
will
get
better
test
scores.
they
will
have
better
grades
and
in
precisely
--
to
precisely
that
extent,
the
preference
itself
will
disappear.
this
court
has
never,
have
never
declared
invalid
or
even
subject
to
strict
judicial
scrutiny
and
--
a
program
which
was
directed
at
benefiting
minorities
who
were
the
subjects
of
previous
racial
discrimination.
mr.
slade
gorton
what
we
do
with
those
findings
is
to
admit
that,
on
the
statistical
basis
of
predicted
first
year
averages,
they
were
below,
but
that
the
law
school
was
not
simply
looking
for
the
150
persons
with
the
highest
predicted
first
year
averages,
that
it
had
other
valid
social
values.
these
people
who
were
below
mr.
defunis
in
predicted
first
year
averages
were,
nevertheless,
qualified
into
law
school
work,
and
were
determined
by
the
law
school
admissions
committee
to
be
ready
and
able
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
they
would
contribute
more,
given
the
nature
of
the
whole
class,
first
to
the
law
school
and
to
the
educational
experience
of
every
student
within
it:
white,
black,
chicano,
the
whole
works,
and
that
they
could
contribute
more
to
the
bar
which,
obviously,
is
the
goal
of
law
school
which,
of
course,
is
only
intermediate
itself.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
no
finding
in
this
record,
mr.
justice
douglas,
because
neither
party
wished
even
to
bring
that
subject
up.
obviously,
mr.
defunis
would
not
make
that
claim,
and
the
university
of
washington
did
not
attempt
in
court
to
prove
that
he’d
engaged
in
previous
racial
discrimination.
i
think,
however,
that
you
are
perfectly
capable
of
looking
for
example
of
the
single
appendix
in
this
case,
seeing
--
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
don’t
think
that
there
has
ever
been,
at
least
in
this
school,
any
kind
of
such
deliberate
attempt.
i
think
because
of
the
difference,
because
of
the
effects
of
racial
discrimination
that
happens
in
fact
even
with
what
you
called
in
the
griggs
case,
for
example,
a
test
which
is
neutral
on
its
surface,
and
you
might
very
well,
in
a
proper
case,
find
that
the
predicted
first
year
average
had
a
built
in
racial
bias.
but,
that
is
not
included
in
particular
findings
or
particular
charges
in
this
case.
what
we
have
done,
you
see,
is
to
try
this
--
is
to
say
that
the
court
--
this
court
has
now,
for
20
years,
said
there
is
a
very
tremendously
high
value
in
an
integrated
society.
we
don’t
think
this
court
says
you
can
only
get
to
an
integrated
society
as
a
result
of
orders
of
this
court,
that
you
can
only
walk,
not
run
to
the
nearest
exit
from
discrimination.
we
have
engaged
in
a
voluntary
program,
very
precise
in
its
outlook.
racial
discrimination
was
the
problem.
therefore,
race
had
to
be
the
criterion
for
solving
that
problem.
we
are
precisely
within
mr.
justice
burger’s
holding
for
this
entire
court
in
swann
v.
charlotte.
“remedial
judicial
authority
does
not
put
judges
in
the
shoes
of
school
authorities
whose
powers
are
plenary.
school
authorities
are
traditionally
charged
with
broad
power
to
formulate
and
implement
educational
policy
and
might
well
conclude,
for
example,
that
in
order
to
prepare
students
to
live
in
a
pluralistic
society,
each
school
should
have
a
prescribed
ratio
of
negro
to
white
students
reflecting
the
proportion
of
the
district
as
a
whole.
to
do
this
as
an
educational
policy
is
within
the
broad
discretionary
powers
of
school
authorities.”
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
not,
your
honor,
but
lots
of
people
are
kept
out
of
the
university
of
washington
law
school.
only
if
one
characterizes
mr.
defunis’
constitutional
entitlement
to
be
to
a
state
financed
law
school
education
does
that
become
a
relevant
question.
in
the
swann
case,
parents
who
expected
in
good
faith
to
be
able
to
choose
their
children’s
school
by
the
choice
of
their
residence,
teachers
who
in
good
faith
felt
they
could
choose
their
assignments
were
told
that
they
could
not
because
integration,
the
end
of
segregation,
was
a
more
important
social
goal.
what
mr.
defunis
was
entitled
to
here
was
essentially
the
same
thing.
he
was
entitled
to
a
policy,
not
a
narrow
policy
which
says
the
highest
grades
get
all
the
positions,
but
a
policy
which
took
into
account
valid
educational
and
professional
grounds
which
include
the
effects
of
discrimination
in
the
world
as
a
whole,
outside
of
the
halls
of
this
law
school
and
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
he
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
school
children
in
swann.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
university
did
not
do
so
in
connection
with
this
particular
program,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
amici
--
many
of
the
briefs
of
friends
of
the
court
here
have
indicated
that
the
statistics,
both
grades
in
college,
for
that
matter
grades
in
the
law
school
frequently,
together
with
the
law
school
admissions
test,
do
not
make
such
predications.
at
the
very
best,
the
statistics
which
mr.
diamond
uses
predict
your
first
year
average
in
law
school.
they
predict
nothing
about
the
contribution
you
will
make
to
the
bar,
the
contribution
you
will
make
to
the
law
school,
how
much
income
you’ll
make
in
the
bar,
what
kind
of
legal
career
you
will
seek.
so,
the
university
of
washington
was
saying
that
we
have
a
responsibility
to
do
more
than
to
predict
or
to
pick
those
students
who
will
get
the
highest
first
year
law
school
grades.
we
have
a
duty
to
pick
people
who
will
serve
their
nation,
their
society.
we
have
a
duty
to
see
to
it
that
the
effects
of
an
exclusionary
policy
which
may
have
not
been
required
by
law
will
be
ended
not
only
in
our
school,
but
in
our
society
as
a
whole.
we
were
doing,
i
submit,
precisely
what
you
said
we
have
the
discretion
to
do
when
you
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
entire
court
in
the
swann
case.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
clear
that,
at
the
primary
school
and
secondary
school
level,
no
one
is
excluded,
but
whether
or
not
that
is
a
greater
or
a
lesser
rate
than
was
--
than
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
really
a
question
--
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
everyone
goes
to
school
through
high
school
or
at
least
is
entitled
to.
no
one
is
entitled
to
a
law
school
education
at
the
expense
of
the
state.
1,300
people
were
excluded
from
this
class
of
the
university
of
washington
law
school,
some
of
one
race
and
some
of
the
very
races
who
were
the
beneficiaries
of
this
special
program.
the
point
is
that
what
the
children
and
their
parents
and
the
teachers
lost
in
swann
was
every
bit
as
vital
a
right
or
every
bit
as
vital
a
privilege
as
the
privilege
which
mr.
defunis
lost
here.
he
wasn’t
entitled
to
admission.
he
was
entitled
to
an
appropriate
judicial
or
an
appropriate
admissions
process,
but
that
--
he
is
telling
you
that
process
must
be
limited.
it
must
be
–
it
must
be
without
any
regard
to
its
effects
on
society
as
a
whole.
he
got
not
only
a
proper
consideration
of
his
application.
he
got
the
best
possible
consideration
to
his
application
and
his
law
school
career
is
much
improved
now,
today
because
it
includes
in
it,
18
members
of
these
minority
groups.
this
will
help
him
in
his
law
school
career.
it
will
help
him
in
his
practice,
but
he
would
have
you
deny
them
a
position
in
law
school
by
the
use
of
mechanical
criteria
not
in
some
theoretical
possible
model,
but
in
exactly
the
same
system
which
we’ve
always
used
before
and
which
did,
in
fact,
result
in
the
exclusion
of
minority
students
of
the
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
sir.
it
is
the
law
school
itself.
our
--
the
statute
creating
the
university
and
creating
the
board
of
regents
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
dean
–
the
dean,
the
faculty,
and
the
admissions
committee.
the
governing
–
the
governing
body
of
the
law
school,
in
effect,
the
policy
setting
body
of
the
law
school
is
the
entire
faculty
when
they
meet
together.
now,
they
do
operate
under
broad
guidelines
from
the
board
of
regents.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
anderson?
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
it
was
--
at
this
particular
time,
it
was
five
faculty
and
two
students.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
--
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
in
that
narrow
sense,
i
would
have
to
say
the
admissions
committee
didn’t
set
the
policy.
it
executed
the
policy.
mr.
slade
gorton
each
of
these
students
were
first
year
law
students.
mr.
slade
gorton
of
the
next
succeeding
class,
that’s
right,
but
they
are
passing
it
on
only
in
the
sense
that
they
are
a
minority
of
the
members
of
the
admissions
committee.
no
person
was
admitted
without
the
approval
of
the
entire
committee,
though
almost
every
particular
application
was
viewed
initially
by
one
or
one
or
two
of
the
members
of
the
committee,
and
his
application
is
passed
on.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
that
is
not
true.
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
slade
gorton
a
few
people
were
denied
admission
without
everyone
reviewing
it.
most
of
those
persons
whose
predicted
first
year
averages
were
below
74.5
and
whom
the
dean
didn’t
feel
should
get
some
extra
kind
of
consideration.
however,
no
one
was
admitted
without
the
entire
committee
viewing
it
and
often
the
recommendation
of
the
individual
person
who
first
viewed
the
file
was
overruled.
the
appendix
to
our
brief
deals
with
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that’s
right.
one
can
--
mr.
slade
gorton
a
person
was
denied
admission
in
one
of
two
fashions;
either
if
his
predicted
first
year
average
was
below
74.5
and
he
did
not
fall
in
one
of
three
categories,
he
is
--
mr.
slade
gorton
minorities
and
so
on,
including
some
of
the
late
students
or,
alternatively,
by
action
of
the
entire
committee.
mr.
slade
gorton
majority
vote,
i
believe,
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
students
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
did
vote
on
their
successors,
all
of
their
successors,
white
as
well
as
minority.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
faculty
of
the
law
school
and
i’m
sure
that
it
went
through
the
board
of
regents
and
was
generally
approved
by
the
board
of
regents.
it
is
--
one
of
the
earlier
questions
asked
whether
this
was
general
university
policy
and
applied
in
other
schools
as
well,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
are
none.
there
is
--
there
are
now,
although
there
weren’t
when
mr.
defunis
started,
the
two
private
law
schools
in
the
state
of
washington.
there
was
one
at
that
time.
mr.
slade
gorton
they
are
more
expensive
than
the
state
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
some
students
would’ve
had
a
hobson’s
choice,
mr.
justice
brennan.
whether
mr.
defunis
falls
into
this
category,
i
don’t
know
and
the
record
doesn’t
indicate.
all
of
the
law
schools,
of
course,
have
scholarship
programs,
so
does
the
university
of
washington.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
do.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
to
that
extent,
michigan
is
something
less
than
a
national
law
school
i
suppose,
too.
i
believe
that
every
state
university
law
school
probably
has
a
majority
or
at
least
a
plurality
of
its
students
from
its
own
state,
and
the
university
of
washington
is
certainly
that.
it
has
attempted
to
be
a
national
law
school
and
it
has
many
students
from
other
states.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
--
it
is
an
element.
with
the
number
of
law
school
applications,
however,
i
think
it’s
probably
a
relatively
small
element
to
that.
thank
you.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
vary
from
my
opening
argument
only
in
connection
with
one
of
the
questions
which
obviously
bothers
this
court
as
to
the
status
of
the
case
itself
and
that
relates
to
whether
or
not
it
is
moot.
we
think
it
is
not
moot,
though
such
a
decision
on
your
part
obviously
would
reinstate
the
state
supreme
court
decision
and
vindicate
our
program.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
defunis
will
enter
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
will,
at
least
as
far
as
this
group
is
that
--
students
are
concerned
subject
to
some
further
challenge
--
mr.
slade
gorton
if
you
found
it
moot
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
already
graduated,
mr.
justice
brennan,
or
were
about
to
graduate?
mr.
slade
gorton
i
suppose
the
original
action
might
have
dismissed
--
might
have
simply
been
dismissed.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
would
validate
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
might
very
well.
that
would
validate
our
program.
in
any
event
--
mr.
slade
gorton
for
the
past.
mr.
slade
gorton
until
someone
else
brought
another
challenge
and
came
back
here,
probably
under
the
same
circumstances
which
is
the
principal
ground
on
which
we
regard
the
case
not
as
being
moot.
as
far
as
mr.
defunis
is
concerned,
the
time
for
registration
for
the
final
quarter
of
his
law
school
began
on
february
20,
it
ends
on
march
1,
the
day
after
tomorrow.
on
thursday,
when
we
left,
he
had
picked
up
his
application
forms.
he
may
or
may
not,
mr.
justice
marshall,
have
filed
them.
he
certainly
will
have
by
friday.
he
would
--
even
if
he
had
been
required
to
ask
readmission,
he
would
have
been
granted
that
readmission
assuming
that
he
was
acceptably
performing
his
law
school
studies,
which
he
is.
he
is
not
law
review,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he’s
roughly
in
the
middle
of
his
class.
once
he
has
registered
on
the
--
no
later
than
the
first
of
march,
there
will
be
--
he
will
then
complete
his
law
school
studies
assuming
he
passes
his
courses
in
the
last
semester.
the
only
discretion
which
would
then
remain
in
the
law
school
would
be
if
he
failed
a
course
in
his
last
semester
and
requested
special
permission
to
come
back
in
the
fall
to
make
up
for
it,
in
which
case
of
course
he’d
be
in
exactly
the
position
as
any
other
student
who
had
failed
would
be.
mr.
slade
gorton
nothing.
he
would
--
assuming
he
passes
his
courses,
he
would
receive
his
degree
and
he
would
take
his
bar
examination.
it
is
not
correct
to
characterize
the
state
supreme
court’s
decision
as
saying
he
was
illegally
in
law
school.
the
state
supreme
court
decision
said
the
program
of
admissions
adopted
by
the
law
school
was
valid,
and
that
he
was
not
deprived
of
equal
protection.
it
did
not
order
us
to
take
him
out
of
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
suspect
that
they
have
probably
rested
on
their
rights
too
long
at
this
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
university
of
washington
law
school
has
selected
its
limited
number
of
students
from
a
large
pool
of
clearly
qualified
candidates.
the
considerations
employed
in
the
difficult,
but
necessary
choice
between
applicants
have
included,
among
several
other
factors,
that
of
the
race
of
those
applicants.
one
goal
of
that
policy
has
been
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
education
of
all
law
students
by
better
preparing
them
to
practice
law
in
a
pluralistic
society.
24
years
ago,
this
court
said
the
law
school,
the
proving
ground
for
legal
learning
and
practice,
cannot
be
effective
in
isolation
from
the
individuals
and
institutions
with
which
the
law
interacts.
a
related
goal
has
been
the
improvement
of
the
entire
legal
profession
by
helping
it
better
to
reflect
and
to
understand
and
to
represent
all
elements
in
the
pluralistic
society
in
which
the
bar
plays
so
important
of
a
role.
this
system
of
law
school
admissions
is
not
unique
or
isolated
to
the
university
of
washington.
with
minor
variations,
it
is
the
system
used
by
a
wide
range
of
american
law
schools,
many
of
whom
have
joined
in
briefs
in
its
defense.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
does
not,
mr.
justice
douglas,
of
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
not.
the
bar
examination
in
the
state
of
washington
is
entirely
anonymous
as
to
every
person
who
takes
it
and
entirely
neutral
as
to
race.
i
can
say,
however,
that
10
of
the
13
members
of
these
4
minority
groups
who
were
in
the
class
of
1973
in
law
school
passed
the
july
1973
bar
examination.
so,
they
were
obviously
qualified
without
any
regard
to
race
whatsoever,
though
i
suspect
their
so-called
predicted
averages
were
much
lower.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
percentage
of
all,
last
year,
was
extraordinary,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
was
92%.
so
that
the
percentage
of
the
minority
students
was
slightly
lower,
but
it
still
was
very
highly
successful.
mr.
slade
gorton
21%,
something
like
that.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
difference
between
92
and
79.
it
still
is
quite
a
high
success
rate.
i
mean,
of
course,
you
get
more
than
one
crack
at
the
bar
examination
there.
mr.
slade
gorton
a
tremendous
--
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
in
the
sense
that
the
law
school
and
the
university
itself
has
recognized
their
almost
total
exclusion
from
the
bar
in
the
society
as
a
whole
and
in
the
state
of
washington.
one
of
the
major
elements
in
the
record
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
dr.
odegaard’s
testimony
to
exactly
that
extent.
actually
here,
in
the
name
of
equal
protection,
this
petitioner
asks
you
to
return
us
to
a
system
of
law
school
student
selection
which
at
the
university
of
washington,
which
has
never
engaged
in
racial
discrimination,
by
force
of
law,
only
produced
12
black
graduates
out
of
3,812
between
1902
and
1969.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
don’t
believe
we
do,
your
honor.
they
applied
in
very
small
numbers.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
i
think
it
is
probable,
but
i
can’t
prove
that
they
applied
in
somewhat
larger
numbers
than
they
were
admitted,
because
in
this
particular
case,
if
you
followed
the
guidelines
which
the
petitioner
has
asked
you
to
follow,
we
would’ve
had
an
absolutely
white
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
a
black
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
a
black
judge
of
the
superior
court
who
was
appointed
just
last
month
in
seattle.
those
are
all
in
court’s
record.
there
are
also
justice
court
judges.
yes,
just
two
in
the
state.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
do
not,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
feel
that
way.
your
statistic
is
accurate
and
it
is
matched
in
connection
with
the
chicano
population
of
the
state,
and
i
do
not
for
three
reasons;
first
the
university
of
washington
is
a
national
law
school.
it
is
not
limited
to
the
state
of
washington.
second,
the
goal
of
this
policy
was
an
educational
goal.
it
wished
to
have
a
sufficient
variety
of
students
in
the
law
school
so
that
their
own
educational
experience
which,
as
you
well
know,
is
largely,
at
least
in
discussions
among
students,
would
be
broadened
and
so
that
the
outlook
of
the
white
students
as
well
as
of
the
minority
students
would
be
more
understanding.
it's
goal
was
also
to
see
to
it
that
the
bar
had
that
same
advantage
of
representing
all
the
classes
and
groups
in
society
in
the
state
of
washington
and
simply
to
fix
some
kind
of
quota-based
precisely
on
state
population
would
meet
neither
of
those
goals.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
there
are
similar
policies
in
other
schools
of
the
university
but
i
cannot
describe
them
in
the
detail
which
i
can
describe
the
one
as
the
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
not,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
am
promoting
here
equal
opportunity
on
the
basis
--
mr.
slade
gorton
alright,
but
we
are
not
--
we
do
not
operate
such
a
system
and
we
are
not
asking
you
to
validate
such
a
system.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
statistical
judgments
or
the
statistical
scores
which
are
used
in
connection
with
law
school
admissions
are
not
invariable
and
totally
accurate
predictors
of
success
nor
do
they
solve
the
problem
of
ending
the
effects
of
racial
discrimination.
in
this
particular
case,
we’re
dealing
with
a
student
who
was
only
marginally
qualified
when
he
was
compared
with
all
of
the
people
who
were
admitted
into
the
school.
there
were
1,601
applications.
most
of
them
were
qualified
people.
330
were
eventually
given
letters
or
notices
of
admission.
on
predicted
first
year
averages,
mr.
defunis
ranked
about
290th
in
that
group
of
330.
a
number
of
people
above
him
were
denied
admission.
a
number
of
people
below
him
were
given
admission.
had
we
picked
the
top
330
and
students
simply
on
the
basis
of
predicted
first
year
average,
one
minority
person
would
have
been
among
it
and
he
didn’t
enter
the
school,
and
we
would’ve
had
a
lily
white
school.
we
might
have
been
subject
to
a
challenge
on
the
basis
that
we
were
deliberately
discriminatory.
we
did
give
notice
to
these
students
that
other
matters
except
for
law
school
admission
test
scores
and
grades
were
counted
in
connection
with
law
school.
you
have
it
on
page
8
of
our
brief.
each
student,
before
he
applied,
received
a
notification,
three
paragraphs
of
which
are
quoted
on
page
8
which
says,
in
the
last
paragraph,
“we
gave
no
preference
to,
but
did
not
discriminate
against
either
washington
residents
or
women
in
making
our
determination,
and
applicant’s
racial
or
ethnic
background
was
considered
as
one
factor
in
our
general
attempt
to
convert
formal
credentials
into
realistic
predictions.
this
is
precisely
what
the
law
school
did.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
i
think
it
was
a
matter
of
considerable
interest
here,
and
i
think
it
may
have
been
somewhat
misstated
by
petitioner,
but
it
does
not.
what
matters
here
is
whether
or
not
the
law
school
admissions
policy
was
based
on
appropriate
educational
judgments
on
the
part
of
the
law
school
itself.
obviously,
neither
mr.
defunis
nor
any
other
individual
had
a
constitutional
right
to
enter
the
university
of
washington
law
school.
that
was
impossible.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
that
it
is,
mr.
justice
white,
as
long
as
it
is
relatively
narrowly
conceived,
remember
to
gain
--
mr.
slade
gorton
alright.
mr.
slade
gorton
let
me
answer
the
question
more
precisely.
we
feel
that,
in
connection
with
these
particular
minorities,
the
fact
of
discrimination
against
them
in
our
society
over
literally
hundreds
of
years
has
had
a
very
real
effect.
it
means
that
fewer
of
them
actually
graduate
from
college
by
percentage
than
other
groups
in
our
society.
it
means
those
who
do
frequently
have
lower
grade
points,
and
certainly
have
shown
up
with
lower
law
school
admissions
test
scores.
so
that
if
we
used
only
these
mathematical
determinants
of
admission
for
law
school,
we
would
continue
to
exclude
them.
we
didn’t
admit
any
of
them
who
were
not
qualified.
i
think
this
is
vitally
important.
even
on
a
statistical
basis,
coupled
with
other
background
items
not
related
to
race
at
all,
they
were
qualified
and
they’ve
shown
themselves
to
be
qualified.
mr.
slade
gorton
neither
of
those
assumptions
are
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
were
not
considered
separately,
except
on
the
same
kind
of
preliminary
basis
that
everyone
was
considered
separately.
all
of
the
people,
other
than
those
who
were
of
such
high
intellectual
attainments
that
they
received
almost
immediate
admission
after
their
applications
came
in,
were
considered
by
an
individual
member
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
not
true
either,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
even
beyond
veterans.
there
were
--
there
was
the
ability
on
the
part
of
the
dean
of
admissions
to
say
that
he
felt
there
were
factors
involved
in
a
particular
application
of
a
white
non-veteran
with
a
pfya
of
below
74.5
which
would
cause
him
to
be
considered
by
the
entire
admissions
committee.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
did
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
was
clearly
a
difference
in
treatment,
but
it
was
a
difference
in
treatment
which
was
required
by
the
admissions
policy
which,
of
course,
was
based
on
the
particular
educational
and
professional
rules
which
the
university
adopted.
however,
remember
that
large
numbers
of
the
members
of
these
minority
groups
were
in
fact
excluded
from
law
school.
there
was
--
they
had
to
have
a
predicted
first
year
average
either
alone
or
coupled
with
other
precise
academic
qualifications
which
would
indicate
that
they
could
successfully
complete
a
law
school
education.
if,
for
example,
one
of
them
came
in
with
a
pfya
of
59
where
the
lowest
passing
grade
in
law
school
is
68,
he
would
not
have
been
admitted.
very
few
were
admitted
below
68
and,
only
in
those
cases
where
something
else
indicated
that
they
could
actually
attain
a
68
or
better
average.
now,
we
were
faced
with
a
situation,
all
of
society
was
faced
with
a
situation
in
connection
with
particular
minorities
who’ve
been
the
subject
of
discrimination
in
the
past
which
could
not
be
cured
by
a
simple
application
of
a
number
of
statistical
formulae.
if
we
were
to
continue
the
old
system,
we
would’ve
continued
the
old
method
of
not
having
these
minority
groups
represented
in
law
school.
moreover,
this
particular
program
is,
in
effect,
self-liquidating.
as
the
effects
of
discrimination
lessened
or
seized,
presumably
more
of
these
minorities
will
graduate
from
college.
they
will
get
better
test
scores.
they
will
have
better
grades
and
in
precisely
--
to
precisely
that
extent,
the
preference
itself
will
disappear.
this
court
has
never,
have
never
declared
invalid
or
even
subject
to
strict
judicial
scrutiny
and
--
a
program
which
was
directed
at
benefiting
minorities
who
were
the
subjects
of
previous
racial
discrimination.
mr.
slade
gorton
what
we
do
with
those
findings
is
to
admit
that,
on
the
statistical
basis
of
predicted
first
year
averages,
they
were
below,
but
that
the
law
school
was
not
simply
looking
for
the
150
persons
with
the
highest
predicted
first
year
averages,
that
it
had
other
valid
social
values.
these
people
who
were
below
mr.
defunis
in
predicted
first
year
averages
were,
nevertheless,
qualified
into
law
school
work,
and
were
determined
by
the
law
school
admissions
committee
to
be
ready
and
able
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
they
would
contribute
more,
given
the
nature
of
the
whole
class,
first
to
the
law
school
and
to
the
educational
experience
of
every
student
within
it:
white,
black,
chicano,
the
whole
works,
and
that
they
could
contribute
more
to
the
bar
which,
obviously,
is
the
goal
of
law
school
which,
of
course,
is
only
intermediate
itself.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
no
finding
in
this
record,
mr.
justice
douglas,
because
neither
party
wished
even
to
bring
that
subject
up.
obviously,
mr.
defunis
would
not
make
that
claim,
and
the
university
of
washington
did
not
attempt
in
court
to
prove
that
he’d
engaged
in
previous
racial
discrimination.
i
think,
however,
that
you
are
perfectly
capable
of
looking
for
example
of
the
single
appendix
in
this
case,
seeing
--
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
don’t
think
that
there
has
ever
been,
at
least
in
this
school,
any
kind
of
such
deliberate
attempt.
i
think
because
of
the
difference,
because
of
the
effects
of
racial
discrimination
that
happens
in
fact
even
with
what
you
called
in
the
griggs
case,
for
example,
a
test
which
is
neutral
on
its
surface,
and
you
might
very
well,
in
a
proper
case,
find
that
the
predicted
first
year
average
had
a
built
in
racial
bias.
but,
that
is
not
included
in
particular
findings
or
particular
charges
in
this
case.
what
we
have
done,
you
see,
is
to
try
this
--
is
to
say
that
the
court
--
this
court
has
now,
for
20
years,
said
there
is
a
very
tremendously
high
value
in
an
integrated
society.
we
don’t
think
this
court
says
you
can
only
get
to
an
integrated
society
as
a
result
of
orders
of
this
court,
that
you
can
only
walk,
not
run
to
the
nearest
exit
from
discrimination.
we
have
engaged
in
a
voluntary
program,
very
precise
in
its
outlook.
racial
discrimination
was
the
problem.
therefore,
race
had
to
be
the
criterion
for
solving
that
problem.
we
are
precisely
within
mr.
justice
burger’s
holding
for
this
entire
court
in
swann
v.
charlotte.
“remedial
judicial
authority
does
not
put
judges
in
the
shoes
of
school
authorities
whose
powers
are
plenary.
school
authorities
are
traditionally
charged
with
broad
power
to
formulate
and
implement
educational
policy
and
might
well
conclude,
for
example,
that
in
order
to
prepare
students
to
live
in
a
pluralistic
society,
each
school
should
have
a
prescribed
ratio
of
negro
to
white
students
reflecting
the
proportion
of
the
district
as
a
whole.
to
do
this
as
an
educational
policy
is
within
the
broad
discretionary
powers
of
school
authorities.”
mr.
slade
gorton
there
is
not,
your
honor,
but
lots
of
people
are
kept
out
of
the
university
of
washington
law
school.
only
if
one
characterizes
mr.
defunis’
constitutional
entitlement
to
be
to
a
state
financed
law
school
education
does
that
become
a
relevant
question.
in
the
swann
case,
parents
who
expected
in
good
faith
to
be
able
to
choose
their
children’s
school
by
the
choice
of
their
residence,
teachers
who
in
good
faith
felt
they
could
choose
their
assignments
were
told
that
they
could
not
because
integration,
the
end
of
segregation,
was
a
more
important
social
goal.
what
mr.
defunis
was
entitled
to
here
was
essentially
the
same
thing.
he
was
entitled
to
a
policy,
not
a
narrow
policy
which
says
the
highest
grades
get
all
the
positions,
but
a
policy
which
took
into
account
valid
educational
and
professional
grounds
which
include
the
effects
of
discrimination
in
the
world
as
a
whole,
outside
of
the
halls
of
this
law
school
and
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
he
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
school
children
in
swann.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
university
did
not
do
so
in
connection
with
this
particular
program,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
amici
--
many
of
the
briefs
of
friends
of
the
court
here
have
indicated
that
the
statistics,
both
grades
in
college,
for
that
matter
grades
in
the
law
school
frequently,
together
with
the
law
school
admissions
test,
do
not
make
such
predications.
at
the
very
best,
the
statistics
which
mr.
diamond
uses
predict
your
first
year
average
in
law
school.
they
predict
nothing
about
the
contribution
you
will
make
to
the
bar,
the
contribution
you
will
make
to
the
law
school,
how
much
income
you’ll
make
in
the
bar,
what
kind
of
legal
career
you
will
seek.
so,
the
university
of
washington
was
saying
that
we
have
a
responsibility
to
do
more
than
to
predict
or
to
pick
those
students
who
will
get
the
highest
first
year
law
school
grades.
we
have
a
duty
to
pick
people
who
will
serve
their
nation,
their
society.
we
have
a
duty
to
see
to
it
that
the
effects
of
an
exclusionary
policy
which
may
have
not
been
required
by
law
will
be
ended
not
only
in
our
school,
but
in
our
society
as
a
whole.
we
were
doing,
i
submit,
precisely
what
you
said
we
have
the
discretion
to
do
when
you
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
entire
court
in
the
swann
case.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
clear
that,
at
the
primary
school
and
secondary
school
level,
no
one
is
excluded,
but
whether
or
not
that
is
a
greater
or
a
lesser
rate
than
was
--
than
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
really
a
question
--
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
everyone
goes
to
school
through
high
school
or
at
least
is
entitled
to.
no
one
is
entitled
to
a
law
school
education
at
the
expense
of
the
state.
1,300
people
were
excluded
from
this
class
of
the
university
of
washington
law
school,
some
of
one
race
and
some
of
the
very
races
who
were
the
beneficiaries
of
this
special
program.
the
point
is
that
what
the
children
and
their
parents
and
the
teachers
lost
in
swann
was
every
bit
as
vital
a
right
or
every
bit
as
vital
a
privilege
as
the
privilege
which
mr.
defunis
lost
here.
he
wasn’t
entitled
to
admission.
he
was
entitled
to
an
appropriate
judicial
or
an
appropriate
admissions
process,
but
that
--
he
is
telling
you
that
process
must
be
limited.
it
must
be
–
it
must
be
without
any
regard
to
its
effects
on
society
as
a
whole.
he
got
not
only
a
proper
consideration
of
his
application.
he
got
the
best
possible
consideration
to
his
application
and
his
law
school
career
is
much
improved
now,
today
because
it
includes
in
it,
18
members
of
these
minority
groups.
this
will
help
him
in
his
law
school
career.
it
will
help
him
in
his
practice,
but
he
would
have
you
deny
them
a
position
in
law
school
by
the
use
of
mechanical
criteria
not
in
some
theoretical
possible
model,
but
in
exactly
the
same
system
which
we’ve
always
used
before
and
which
did,
in
fact,
result
in
the
exclusion
of
minority
students
of
the
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
sir.
it
is
the
law
school
itself.
our
--
the
statute
creating
the
university
and
creating
the
board
of
regents
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
dean
–
the
dean,
the
faculty,
and
the
admissions
committee.
the
governing
–
the
governing
body
of
the
law
school,
in
effect,
the
policy
setting
body
of
the
law
school
is
the
entire
faculty
when
they
meet
together.
now,
they
do
operate
under
broad
guidelines
from
the
board
of
regents.
mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
anderson?
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
it
was
--
at
this
particular
time,
it
was
five
faculty
and
two
students.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
--
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
in
that
narrow
sense,
i
would
have
to
say
the
admissions
committee
didn’t
set
the
policy.
it
executed
the
policy.
mr.
slade
gorton
each
of
these
students
were
first
year
law
students.
mr.
slade
gorton
of
the
next
succeeding
class,
that’s
right,
but
they
are
passing
it
on
only
in
the
sense
that
they
are
a
minority
of
the
members
of
the
admissions
committee.
no
person
was
admitted
without
the
approval
of
the
entire
committee,
though
almost
every
particular
application
was
viewed
initially
by
one
or
one
or
two
of
the
members
of
the
committee,
and
his
application
is
passed
on.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
that
is
not
true.
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
slade
gorton
a
few
people
were
denied
admission
without
everyone
reviewing
it.
most
of
those
persons
whose
predicted
first
year
averages
were
below
74.5
and
whom
the
dean
didn’t
feel
should
get
some
extra
kind
of
consideration.
however,
no
one
was
admitted
without
the
entire
committee
viewing
it
and
often
the
recommendation
of
the
individual
person
who
first
viewed
the
file
was
overruled.
the
appendix
to
our
brief
deals
with
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that’s
right.
one
can
--
mr.
slade
gorton
a
person
was
denied
admission
in
one
of
two
fashions;
either
if
his
predicted
first
year
average
was
below
74.5
and
he
did
not
fall
in
one
of
three
categories,
he
is
--
mr.
slade
gorton
minorities
and
so
on,
including
some
of
the
late
students
or,
alternatively,
by
action
of
the
entire
committee.
mr.
slade
gorton
majority
vote,
i
believe,
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
students
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
did
vote
on
their
successors,
all
of
their
successors,
white
as
well
as
minority.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
faculty
of
the
law
school
and
i’m
sure
that
it
went
through
the
board
of
regents
and
was
generally
approved
by
the
board
of
regents.
it
is
--
one
of
the
earlier
questions
asked
whether
this
was
general
university
policy
and
applied
in
other
schools
as
well,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
are
none.
there
is
--
there
are
now,
although
there
weren’t
when
mr.
defunis
started,
the
two
private
law
schools
in
the
state
of
washington.
there
was
one
at
that
time.
mr.
slade
gorton
they
are
more
expensive
than
the
state
law
school.
mr.
slade
gorton
some
students
would’ve
had
a
hobson’s
choice,
mr.
justice
brennan.
whether
mr.
defunis
falls
into
this
category,
i
don’t
know
and
the
record
doesn’t
indicate.
all
of
the
law
schools,
of
course,
have
scholarship
programs,
so
does
the
university
of
washington.
mr.
slade
gorton
we
do.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
to
that
extent,
michigan
is
something
less
than
a
national
law
school
i
suppose,
too.
i
believe
that
every
state
university
law
school
probably
has
a
majority
or
at
least
a
plurality
of
its
students
from
its
own
state,
and
the
university
of
washington
is
certainly
that.
it
has
attempted
to
be
a
national
law
school
and
it
has
many
students
from
other
states.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
--
it
is
an
element.
with
the
number
of
law
school
applications,
however,
i
think
it’s
probably
a
relatively
small
element
to
that.
thank
you.
