justice
william

rehnquist
let
me
interrupt
you
just
a
minute.
you’re
not
suggesting
that
a
law
school
admissions
committee
has
to
take
the
150
brightest
of
the
applicants
or
the
ones
who
demonstrate
the
highest
scores
on
a
test,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
decision
of
this
court
came
down,
say,
on
may
1
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington?
what
would
the
board
of
regents
do
with
the
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
say
qualified,
mr.
gorton,
really
by
the
time
you’ve
diluted
that
phrase
as
much
as
you
have
in
your
approach
to
admissions,
it
doesn’t
mean
a
whole
lot,
does
it,
when
you
consider
the
minority
applicants
separately
and
really
don’t
have
any
base
--
any
cutoff
point
on
the
predicted
first
year
average?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

it
took
the
dean’s
intervention
to
do
that
with
a
white
person,
and
it
did
not

justice
william

rehnquist

that
was

so
that
was
a
difference
in
treatment,
was
it
not?

rehnquist
mr.
gorton,
you
said
the
admissions
committee
just
executed
the
policy,
it
didn’t
formulate
it.
