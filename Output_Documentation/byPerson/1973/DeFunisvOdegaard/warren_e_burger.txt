warren
e.
burger
for
the

chief
justice

yes.
chief

warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
others
who
had
76.4,
would
they
have
an
equal
protection
claim,
not
having
been
given
a
special
dispensation
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
that
was
because
they
didn’t
apply.
do
you

anything
in
the

on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.

i
think
a
negro
population
or
at
least
one
of
the
minority
group
populations
of
2.2
or
some
such
figure.
would
you
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
state

washington
to
say
that
we
will
admit
2.2%
to
the
law
school
a
particular
minority
that
was
--
had
a
2.2
membership
in

or
number
290?
chief

warren
e.

anything

school
however?

warren
e.
burger

--
chief

warren
e.
burger

sort
of
generalized
study
to
determine
whether
grades
had
a
direct
correlation
with
success
and
defectiveness
in
the
practice
of
law?[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
haven’t
pointed
out
how
