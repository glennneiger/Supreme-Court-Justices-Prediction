mr.
josef
diamond
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
plaintiffs,
petitioners
rather,
brought
this
action
for
the
reason
that
marco
defunis,
jr.
was,
on
two
occasions,
wrongfully
denied
admission
to
the
law
school.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
mathematical
grades
alone
were
the
sole
admission
criteria
employed
by
the
law
school,
but
the
record
is
clear
that,
taking
all
criteria
in
account,
in
the
law
school’s
own
judgment
its
minority
program
resulted
into
the
admission
of
minority
students
less
qualified
than
non-minority
students
who
were
rejected
particularly
because
there
appears
to
be
some
misconception
of
the
facts
by
many
of
the
amici
briefs,
and
possibly
also
the
respondents.
i’d
like
to
discuss
a
little
bit
of
the
background
and
the
factual
situation
with
reference
to
marco
defunis.
at
the
time
we
agreed
to
represent
marco
defunis,
we
had
not
met
him
and
knew
very
little
about
him.
from
the
facts
related
to
us,
in
which
we
were
later
able
to
verify,
we
were
certain
that
there
was
something
wrong.
marco
attended
grade
school
and
high
school
in
seattle,
was
graduated
from
the
university
of
washington
as
an
honor
student
in
1970.
he
received
phi
beta
capa,
magna
cum
laude,
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
had
worked
20-40
hours
a
week
all
the
time
that
he
was
in
college
as
manual
labor
for
the
park
department
of
the
city.
he
also
taught
sunday
school.
he
had
a
junior-senior
grade
point
average
of
3.71
out
of
a
possible
4
as
calculated
by
the
law
school,
or
a
3.8
when
you
include
9
hours
of
straight-a
he
received
in
latin
in
the
first
quarter
of
his
junior
year
in
the
summer
of
1968,
which
the
law
school
would
not,
for
some
reason,
consider.
in
1971,
after
he
had
been
rejected
by
the
law
school
and
advised
that
if
he
tried
again
the
following
year
there
might
be
room
for
him,
he
went
to
graduate
school
at
the
same
university
of
washington.
he
took
24
hours
of
graduate
work,
again
working
30-40
hours
a
week
with
the
park
department,
and
he
turned
in
grades
of
21
hours
of
a.
at
the
time
of
his
application,
there
were
3
hours
of
incomplete
because
he
hadn’t
got
the
grades
as
yet.
he
had
taken
the
law
school
admissions
test
on
three
occasions
and
received
scores
of
512,
566,
and
568,
and
had
writing
scores
of
62,
58,
and
64.
the
law
school
aptitude
test
of
668,
which
is
the
final
one
he
took,
was
within
the
top
7%
of
all
law
school
applicants
across
the
nation
who
had
ever
taken
it
in
the
past
several
years.
for
defunis
as
well
as
all
other
applicants,
the
junior-senior
grade
point
averages
and
the
lsat
scores
were
combined,
using
a
formula
to
arrive
to
what
was
referred
to
as
a
predicted
first
year
average,
which
in
defunis’
case,
was
76.23.
he
had
little
money,
and
his
wife
worked
as
a
dental
assistant
to
help
him
through
school
and
he
was
also
helped
by
his
parents.
he
didn’t
know
why
he
was
denied
admission
to
the
law
school.
we
didn’t
know
what
his
religion
was,
nor
his
race,
nor
whether
he
belonged
to
a
so-called
minority
group,
nor
what
constituted
a
minority
group.
we
didn’t
think
it
mattered
what
his
religion
was
or
whether
he
was
black,
red,
or
white.
it
was
inconceivable
to
us
that
an
honor
student
with
the
grades
that
he
has:
phi
beta
capa,
magna
cum
laude,
from
the
same
university
would
not
be
qualified
and
would
be
denied
admission
to
the
university
law
school.
to
us,
it
wasn’t
possible
that
all
those
who
were
being
admitted
were
better
qualified
than
defunis.
we
first
met
with
the
dean
of
the
law
school
and
inquired
“what
was
the
basis
of
denial,”
he
had
the
chairman
of
the
admissions
committee?
the
only
answer
we
could
get
was
that
there
were
other
students
better
qualified
than
defunis.
we
told
him
we
couldn’t
accept
that.
we
had
to
see
something
to
verify
that
fact.
the
records
were
confidential.
even
though
we
said
we
weren’t
interested
in
names,
just
records
to
establish
that
there
were
150
or
more
better
qualified.
“no,
that
was
confidential
matters.”
we
next
appeared
and
met
with
the
board
of
regents,
took
his
parents
with
us,
i
don’t
think
we
took
the
boy.
again,
board
of
regents
listened
and
said
they
would
let
us
know,
advised
us
that
“no,”
they
were
going
to
stand
by
the
decision
made
by
the
dean
of
the
law
school
and
the
admissions
committee,
and
that
there
was
no
room
for
marco
defunis.
we
had
no
any
alternative
after
he’d
been
denied
twice,
but
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
and
it
was
only
after
litigation
was
started
and
during
pretrial
discovery
in
the
taking
of
depositions
and
in
fact
only
during
the
trial
itself
that
we’re
able
to
get
a
court
order
requiring
the
university
to
produce
the
files
and
the
records
of
some
of
those
who
were
being
admitted,
and
we
had
to
look
at
them
during
the
noon
hour
because
the
trial
was
in
process
and
the
court
ordered
them
to
be
brought
down
to
the
courtroom,
but
not
all
1,500
or
1,600.
we
settled
for
about
300
or
400
and
during
the
noon
hour,
we
went
through
those
records.
and,
the
record
here
will
show
you
what
we
found
when
we
went
through
them
and
we
put
them
in
evidence
is
who
they
were
taking
into
the
school.
now,
what
the
university
admissions
class
really
did,
they
admitted
two
classes,
not
one.
they
took
the
non-minority
group
and
they
looked
at
their
grades,
and
we’re
not
saying
they
looked
only
at
their
grades
but
what
else
was
there
to
look
at?
there
were
no
personal
interviews.
they
looked
at
their
grades,
and
the
file
they
had
the
grades,
honors,
recommendations,
everybody
had
a
recommendation
that
they
produced,
the
application
of
the
student,
and
that’s
about
all.
and,
they
determined,
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
that
anybody
who
had
a
predicted
first
year
average
of
77
would
automatically
be
admitted
with
a
few
exceptions,
most
of
those
came
in
later,
and
they
actually
admitted
those
too.
so,
everyone
who
had
a
77
or
higher
are
automatically
admitted.
then,
they
took
the
next
list
and
anyone
that
were
75
--
74.5,
they
were
automatically
eliminated
with
the
exception
of
the
minorities.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
there
were
some
returning
servicemen,
except
those
two,
and
we’re
raising
no
question
about
the
returning
servicemen.
mr.
josef
diamond
most
of
them
had
previously
been
admitted
and
they
were
brought
back,
and
we
never
at
any
time
raised
an
issue
about
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
correct
to
look
at
them.
mr.
josef
diamond
we
requested
all
of
the
minority
groups
that
were
brought
in
and
some
of
the
additional
others
that
were
kind
of
at
random.
there
were
1,600.
we
couldn’t
get
them.
we
knew
we
wouldn’t
really
look
at
them
all.
mr.
josef
diamond
and
so,
we
got
those
that
we
could
look
and
we
looked
at
them
in
the
jury
room
during
the
noon
hour
and
there
was
markings
on
the
cover
with
most
of
them.
mr.
josef
diamond
so,
we
could
hurriedly
go
through
it.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
i
believe
so.
now,
when
they
divide
it
into
two
classes,
they
took
the
non-minority
group
and
they
determined
they
were
less
than
between
those
--
between
77
and
74.5
with
the
exception
of
the
minority
groups.
now,
the
minority
groups
they
took,
and
the
black
minority
groups
they
gave
to
one
of
the
admission
members
who
was
a
black
student,
a
freshman
at
the
law
school,
and
gave
him
to
review.
they
took
the
other
non
--
the
other
minority
groups
and
gave
them
to
dean
hunter
on
the
admission
group
and
had
him
review
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
in
the
minority
group,
besides
the
negroes,
they
had
the
chicanos,
the
american-indians,
the
--
mr.
josef
diamond
filipino-americans
and
i
think
that’s
it.
now,
that
too
was
just
an
arbitrary
determination.
so,
out
of
the
total
number
of
minorities
that
had
applied,
there
was
some
70
and
something
like
40
of
those
were
admitted.
something
around
60
or
65,
close
to
70%
of
all
of
the
minorities
that
applied
were
admitted
to
the
law
school,
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
only
something
less
than
10%
of
everyone
else
that
was
admitted.
now,
the
--
as
they
singled
out
the
minorities,
they
were
not
thrown
out
if
they
were
below
74.5,
and
we
find
that
minorities
were
admitted
with
grades
like
69.7,
67.14
compared
to
defunis
with
a
76.23,
when
77
would’ve
admitted
him.
now,
the
--
in
determining
that
the
black-americans
and
the
chicanos
and
the
filipino-americans
and
the
american-indians
were
minority
applicants,
there
wasn’t
any
determine
--
actually,
what
constitute
and
how
would
you
determine
that
you
were
a
black-american
or
you
were
a
chicano?
it’s
not
always
that
easy.
what’s
their
percentages
or
what
not?
well,
you
made
your
own
characterization
on
the
application
blank
as
to
what
you
were,
but
you
weren’t
required
to,
and
no
one
told
anyone
that
if
you
were
one
of
the
minorities,
you’re
going
to
get
special
treatment,
but
you
did
get
special
treatment
and
they
set
up
two
classes.
now,
when
they
had
these
two
classes,
in
order
to
determine
how
many
you’re
going
to
allow
in
from
each
class,
you
had
to
arrive
at
a
racial,
there
was
no
other
way.
you’re
going
to
allow
all
the
minorities
in
or
not,
you
couldn’t.
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they
left
a
great
percentage,
some
60%
of
the
minorities
in
and
only
10%
of
the
whites.
but,
they
had
to
make
a
determination
and
call
it
what
you
please,
is
recorded.
mr.
josef
diamond
these
are
the
ones
that
were
admitted,
that
were
offered
admission,
invited.
yes,
that’s
correct.
they
invited
some
311
and
was
later
stretched
to
330
that
were
invited,
knowing
that
there
was
some
that
would
not
come
into
the
class
and
would
go
elsewhere,
who
had
applied
in
more
than
one
school,
so
that
they
could
reduce
it
down
and
they
would
only
have
approximately
150.
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
i
don’t
think
there
is,
but
there
is
in
the
special
appendix
at
page
44,
i
believe
it
is,
a
list
of
all
those
and
their
qualifications
as
to
how
they
appeared.
mr.
josef
diamond
on
the
application
form
you
were
requested
to
circle
one
of
the
following.
the
afro-american,
american-indian,
caucasian,
mexican,
or
a
mexican-american,
oriental
or
other:
specify
and
you’re
asked
to
either
circle
or
to
specify,
but
it
awarded
its
law
admissions'
preferences
to
black-americans,
chicano-americans,
american-indians,
and
filipino-americans.
now,
an
applicant
couldn’t
characterize
himself
as
a
filipino-american
and,
although
filipino-americans
were
granted
special
admission
preferences,
an
applicant
could
characterize
himself
as
an
oriental-american
but
an
oriental
wasn’t
granted
any
special
preference.
there
was
no
indication
at
anytime
that
the
minorities
would
be
granted
some
preference,
but
you
were
requested
to
fill
that
out
and
you
could
do
so
or
not
as
you
please
and
you
made
your
own
self-determination
as
where
you
belong.
now,
if
marco
had
been
invited
as
one
of
the
three--
mr.
josef
diamond
we
wouldn’t
be
here
today.
mr.
josef
diamond
we
wouldn’t
have
any
problem,
none.
now,
as
there
were
311
and
later
330
who
were
invited
to
be
enrolled,
obviously,
marco
is
very
anxious
to
get
in.
if
he
had
been
invited,
he
would’ve
had
accepted
and
he
would’ve
been
in.
mr.
josef
diamond
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
he
comes
of
jewish
parents.
i
didn’t
know
at
the
time
we
brought
this
action.
i
think,
sephardic
jew,
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
his
parents
lived
in
seattle
for
more
than
50
years.
whether
they
were
born
there,
i’m
not
sure.
he
grew
up
there.
he’s
a
middle
family.
his
father,
i
think,
is
a
furniture
salesman.
he
went
to
school,
as
i
indicated,
worked
all
the
time,
got
help
from
his
parents,
help
from
his
wife
to
get
through
school,
and
made
his
grades
at
the
same
time.
mr.
josef
diamond
was
he
an
underprivileged
or
disadvantaged?
now,
there
was
no
indication
that
the
minorities
that
were
being
helped
were
underprivileged
or
disadvantaged
or
somebody
that
was
poor
or
needed
help.
no
determination
of
any
kind.
if
you
just
fit
in
this
category,
well,
you
got
special
privilege.
mr.
josef
diamond
if
you
just
circle
one
of
those.
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
correct.
they
never
saw
you.
they
didn’t
know
anything
about
you.
now
--
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
mr.
defunis
is
still
in
law
school.
mr.
josef
diamond
it
begins
sometime,
i
believe,
in
february.
this
–
now
--
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
i’m
hoping
that
he
will
graduate.
defunis
is
in
law
school.
now,
you
asked
for
some
briefs
on
the
question
of
mootness
and
we
furnished
them
to
them
--
to
you.
mr.
defunis
will
graduate
in
june,
and
he’s
doing
exceedingly
well,
provided
you
do
not
sustain
the
supreme
court.
if
you
sustain
the
supreme
court,
he
is
only
in
law
school
at
the
present
time
because
we
have
a
stay
signed
by
judge
douglas
or
justice
douglas
which
prevents
the
law
school
and
the
university
from
doing
anything
about
him
being
in
the
school.
i
might
go
back
and
say
that
when
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
reversed
the
lower
court,
we
had
a
problem.
mr.
defunis
was
notified
that
he
better
apply
to
the
school
and
they
would
--
the
admissions
committee,
and
they
would
determine
whether
they’d
let
him
back
in
school
or
not
or
whether
he
could
stay
in
school.
mr.
josef
diamond
right
after
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
entered
their
remitter
and
it
came
down,
and
at
that
time
--
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
right.
he
was
in
his
second
year
in
school
at
that
time.
the
sole
process,
no
fault
of
any
party
on
either
side,
but
the
supreme
court
was
a
little
bit
slower
in
coming
out
with
a
decision
and
marco
was
in
school
all
this
time.
and
when
that
happened,
we
got
a
stay
from
judge
douglas
which
prevented
the
university
from
doing
anything
about
it.
now,
what
they
would’ve
done,
i
don’t
know
but
certainly,
they
had
the
right
and
he
was,
according
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
our
state,
illegally
in
school
and
he
has
been
there
in
the
eyes
of
his
--
the
faculty
and
fellow
students,
illegally
there
because
the
supreme
court
has
said
“you
were
not
rightfully
there,
but
you’re
there
until
this
decision
is
made
by
this
court
pursuant
to
a
stay.”
mr.
josef
diamond
yes.
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
i
believe
that
that
application
for
his
last
quarter,
we
run
in
quarters
at
our
school,
is
sometime
this
month
and
i
assume
that
he
has
applied
because
there’s
a
stay
and
there’s
nothing
to
stop
him.
i
don’t
know.
i
think
he
has
applied
and
i
think
if
he
hasn’t,
he
will
apply.
and,
i
might
also
state
further
--
mr.
josef
diamond
for
the
first
time
--
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
right,
and
i
think
so
he
must
be
due.
i
have
not
been
in
touch
with
him
in
the
last
couple
of
days
i
have
been
here.
i
might
state
further
that,
for
the
first
time,
we
have
something
in
writing.
in
the
brief,
respondent’s
brief,
they
state
that
mr.
marco
defunis
will
graduate.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
think
that’s
right,
but
if
this
court
reverses
this
decision,
and
assuming
they
could
do
it
in
the
next
--
sometime
before
june
or
before
he
gets
his
diploma
--
mr.
josef
diamond
what
have
i
got
to
protect
marco
defunis?
i
don’t
know
who’s
going
to
be.
we
just
had
a
change
in
the
presidency
of
the
university.
we
can
have
a
change
in
the
faculty.
i
have
nothing,
but
a
statement
in
the
brief
that
says
“we’re
going
to
let
him
finish,”
under
a
court
decision
that
says
you
are
illegally
in
the
school.
i
don’t
think
we
can
rely
on
that.
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
and
i
think
there’s
something
more.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
don’t
know.
i
can’t
answer
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
if
this
court
--
mr.
josef
diamond
if
this
court
keeps
the
decision
under
wraps
until
after
june
and
he
gets
his
diploma
and
graduates,
i
don’t
think
even
if
you
then
reverse
it
or
what
happens,
i
don’t
think
anybody
will
come
and
take
his
diploma
away
from
him,
but
he
--
i
don’t
know
whether
you’re
going
to
keep
it
that
long.
i
might
also
say
and
we
have
a
brief,
there’s
more
than
just
this
one
case
now
that
we’ve
got
this
far.
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
it
is
not
a
class
action
and
we’re
not
concerned
with
that.
but,
under
the
authorities
which
we
have
submitted
to
you,
and
i
think
you’ve
reviewed
before
you
called
to
set
this
grant
of
certiorari,
we
did
point
out
that
there
are
other
like
situations
which
are
going
to
come
up
and
that
this
case
ought
to
be
decided.
now,
counsel
has
not
taken
the
position
that
this
case
is
moot.
we
have
not
taken
that
this
--
a
position
that
this
case
is
moot
and
it
is
not,
as
far
as
we’re
concerned.
we
still
have
a
live
situation
in
spite
of
the
statement
which
appeared
just
--
when
we
got
the
respondent’s
brief,
which
was
only
about
two
weeks
ago,
three
weeks
ago,
where
they
stated
that
he
would
stay
in
school
and
finish
if
he
registers,
and
he
probably
has
registered
by
now.
mr.
josef
diamond
oh,
i
can,
but
i
think
you
can
assume
that
he
either
has
or
he
will.
i
don’t
think
anybody
would
stop
at
--
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
of
course
--
mr.
josef
diamond
i’ll
be
glad
to
supply
that
to
you.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
have
no
hesitancy
about
it,
none
whatsoever.
no,
none
whatsoever.
i
just
don’t
have
the
information.
maybe
counsel
has
it.
i’m
assuming
that
he
has
and
i’m
sure
he
has
because
he
was
instructed
to
go
ahead
and
do
it,
and
there’s
no
reason
why
he
shouldn’t.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
would
think
so,
but
i’m
not
too
sure
i
can
answer
that
question.
i
believe,
in
the
state
of
washington,
you
can't
take
the
bar
examination
without
having
a
degree.
i
think
you
can,
through
an
association
with
a
lawyer
obtain
it
and
i
do
believe
that
he
would
be
permitted
to
pass
the
bar.
i
think
though
that
on
the
question
of
mootness,
i
think
we
have
decided
that
or
this
court
has
prior
to
this
time,
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
know
and
have
a
degree
that
he
earned
that
is
legally
his,
and
that
he
has
not
got
it
by
default.
and,
i
think
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondent,
they
say
that
this
question
will
arise
again
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
in
my
office
two
clients,
one
girl
and
one
man,
waiting
for
the
determination
of
this
to
see
whether
they
can
get
into
law
school.
mr.
josef
diamond
oh
no,
not
at
all.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
he’s
earning
them.
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
i’m
not
saying
that
his
degree
would
be
one
by
default.
i
am
saying
that
he
is
in
law
school
illegally.
the
fact
that
he
is
making
his
grades
and
he
is
going
to
get
his
degree
because
he
has
passing
grades
and
i
think
he’s
near
the
top
of
his
class,
so
that
on
that
score
we
will
have
no
problem.
but,
he
is
not
there,
as
far
as
his
faculty
--
the
faculty
is
concerned
and
as
far
as
the
other
students.
he
has
had
a
difficult
time
because
he
is
there
only
because
of
the
time
element
involved
in
getting
this
question
decided,
and
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
have
a
decision
of
this
court
saying
that
he
is
rightfully
there.
now,
i
did
want
to
make
sure
because
i
don’t
know
just
how
the
respondents
are
going
to
present
this
matter,
but
i
do
want
the
court
to
understand
that
it
isn’t
--
there’s
no
question
in
this
case
but
what
the
minorities
were
given
per
--
preferential
treatment
and
that
mr.
defunis,
if
he
was
black,
he
would’ve
been
admitted
in
the
school.
the
lower
court
found
that.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
found
that.
now,
the
only
thing
they
said,
he
was
given
--
in
the
supreme
court,
he
was
given
preference.
he
was
given
special
--
the
blacks
were
given
special
treatment
and
the
minorities,
and
the
only
reason
that
they
reversed
the
lower
court
was
that
they
said
there
was
an
overriding
public
interest
and
i
submit
and
we’ve
set
it
forth
in
the
briefs
that
there
cannot
be
an
overriding
public
interest
on
this
question
to
admit
those
who
are
not
equally
qualified
into
the
law
school,
and
that’s
the
only
basis
and
the
only
reason
our
supreme
court
allowed
reversal
of
that
case.
and,
i
want
to
be
sure
that
we
understand
the
testimony
of
professor
kumer
--
mr.
josef
diamond
yes?
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
sir.
i’m
not
saying
that.
i
am
saying
that
they’ve
got
treat
everybody
alike
and
they’re
not
going
to
set
up
two
classes,
one
minority
and
one
non-minority.
they
can
set
up
any
test
they
like
and
their
going
to
have
to,
in
my
opinion,
going
to
treat
them
alike
and
not
treat
them
as
two
separate
classes
as
they
did
here.
you
had
two
separate
groups,
separate
tests,
and
separate
consideration
for
each
of
these
two
groups.
and,
that,
i
think
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
a
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
which
we
have
pointed
out.
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
right.
that
was
found
in
the
lower
court.
it
was
also
found
in
the
supreme
court
of
our
state,
and
the
only
reason
they
didn’t
was
they
found
an
overriding
public
interest
to
try
and
do
something
for
past
discrimination
against
minority
students,
of
which
of
course,
defunis
had
nothing
to
do
with.
now,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
any
effort
that
you
can
on
the
affirmative
program
to
try
and
help
minorities.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
and
we
didn’t
even
know
we’re
in
a
minority
case
when
we
tried
to
get
mr.
defunis
into
this
law
school.
we
have
no
quarrel
and
there
are
plenty
of
affirmative
action
programs
that
can
be
undertaken
to
get
more
minorities
into
the
law
schools,
and
we
are
in
favor
of
that.
we’re
not
suggesting
for
a
moment,
that
you
shouldn’t
have
it,
but
we
do
not
think
that
you
can
use
race
to
--
and
to
keep
out
one
group
solely
and
only
because
of
race,
and
that’s
what
was
done
here.
if
defunis
had
been
black,
he
would’ve
been
in.
he
was
kept
out
because
he
was
white.
the
only
reason
he
was
kept
out,
no
other
reason.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
better
save
a
little
time,
thank
you.
mr.
josef
diamond
thank
you.
counsel
has
stated
that
a
number
of
minority
students
or
a
number
of
non-minority
students
that
had
grades
below
74.5
were
accepted.
i
call
court’s
attention
to
schedule
a
in
the
single
appendix
at
page
37,
and
there
it
lists
all
of
those
who
were
admitted
to
the
class
as
of
august
1,
1971
and
you’ll
find
that
not
a
single
non-minority
student
was
accepted
with
grades
anywhere
near
as
low
as
--
that
were
accepted
for
the
minorities.
they’re
all
spelled
out
and
there
isn’t
one.
i
also
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
do
not
contend
that
the
applicants
were
accepted
on
grades
alone
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
was
not
that
they
accepted
students
with
lower
grades
alone,
they
accepted
lower
--
students
with
lower
grades
and
qualifications.
they
examined
the
entire
record
on
all
the
students,
the
minorities
and
the
non-minorities,
and
they
accepted
those
with
lower
grades.
the
same
question
answers
the
other
one
as
to
who
set
up
this
policy.
the
question,
which
is
in
the
record,
was
asked
of
the
president
of
the
law
school,
mr.
odegaard,
in
connection
with
the
new
policy
with
reference
to
minorities
that
you
have
approved.
mr.
josef
diamond
the
president
of
the
university,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
josef
diamond
excuse
me,
president
of
the
law
school.[attempt
to
laughter]
if
the
new
policy
with
reference
to
minorities
--
university,
i’m
sorry,
that
you
have
approved
and
the
regents
have
approved
or
adopted,
whether
that
policy
permits
the
law
school
admissions
to
admit
minority
students
with
lower
grades
and
qualifications
and
the
other
students.
and,
his
answer
was
“i
think
it
does,”
and
the
same
thing
with
reference
to
dean
ronis.
when
he
was
the
dean
of
the
law
school,
he
testified
to
the
same
thing,
and
the
court
found
--
the
lower
court
found
and
the
supreme
court
found
that
they
were
allowing
students
in
with
lower
grades
and
qualifications.
we’re
not
just
talking
about
mechanical
grades.
the
question
was
asked
and
counsel
made
the
statement
--
mr.
josef
diamond
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
the
qualifications
are
what
were
in
their
application
file,
filled
out
by
them.
the
recommendations
that
they
furnished
their
grades,
their
honors,
the
courses
that
they
took
are
listed
along
with
their
grades
that
were
submitted,
and
their
work
habits.
as
was
shown
there,
defunis
worked.
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
sir.
the
record
shows
that
that’s
all
that
the
admissions
committee
had
to
look
at.
mr.
josef
diamond
how
do
we
know
what?
mr.
josef
diamond
because
the
university,
in
their
testimony
stated
so.
the
president
said
so,
dean
ronis
said
so,
the
chairman,
mr.
--
professor
kumer
said
so
that
they
were
accepted.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
without
qualifications,
they
testified
that
students
with
lower
qualifications
and
without
lower
grades
were
accepted.
they
did,
and
they
said
that
they
were
reaching
out
to
get
more.
mr.
josef
diamond
they
had
nothing
else
to
go
on.
there
couldn’t
be
anything
else.
all
they
had
was
the
same
thing
that
they
had
with
reference
to
mr.
defunis.
one
other
thing
--
mr.
josef
diamond
in
some
case,
and
that
one
i
read,
but
the
others
it
was
not.
it
was
--
in
dean
futeus
it
was
not
--
in
dean
ronis
it
was
not.
he
testified
to
it
himself.
the
other
question
that
was
asked
--
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
that’s
a
relative
matter.
the
university
testified
that
they
were
qualified
for
the
law
school,
but
it’s
a
relative
matter.
they
set
up
these
two
classes.
if
they
took
those
that
had
better
qualifications
as
they
admitted,
they
wouldn’t
have
had
room
for
these.
so,
they
had
to
set
up
a
ratio
between
them.
if
they
did
say
and
they
did
testify
that
any
of
the
1,600
they
thought
could
have
maintained
themselves
in
school,
and
would’ve
passed.
but,
you’ve
got
a
relative
situation.
you
can’t
take
1,600.
so,
they
were
--
should
be
taking,
we
would
assume,
the
better
qualified,
not
necessarily
the
better
grades.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
record
and
you
look
at
the
findings
of
the
courts,
you’ll
find
that
they
did
not.
mr.
josef
diamond
the
university’s
goals?
mr.
josef
diamond
let
me
--
mr.
josef
diamond
let
me
answer
that
with
this
--
mr.
josef
diamond
i
think
if
they
use
the
same
test
for
everyone,
they
would
have
that
right,
but
let
me
answer
you
that
with
this
notation
--
mr.
josef
diamond
whatever
they
use,
when
you
have
1,600
people
making
application,
and
you
only
have
room
for
150,
you’re
going
to
have
to
make
some
determination
of
which
are
the
best
qualified.
now,
the
only
thing
we’ve
got
here
is
the
president
of
the
university,
the
dean
of
the
law
school,
the
chairman
of
the
admissions
committee
telling
us
that
they
did
not
select
the
best
qualified
students.
i
can’t
give
you
any
more
than
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
let
me
--
mr.
josef
diamond
we
got
enough.
mr.
josef
diamond
well
--
mr.
josef
diamond
let
me
cover
this
one
for
just
a
moment.
on
january
9,
1974
--
mr.
josef
diamond
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
i
owned
there
for
two.
on
january
9,
1974,
i
requested
and
received
a
letter
from
the
attorney
general
with
reference
to
the
19
specially
admitted
students,
and
this
is
what
they
tell
me.
“of
the
19
specially
admitted
in
the
class
commencing
september
1971,
10
of
whom
are
black,
3
chicano,
3
asian-american,
3
native-american,
15
are
currently
enrolled
in
the
law
school,
7
of
whom
are
black,
3
chicano,
3
asian-americans,
and
2
native-americans.
now,
out
of
the
19
then
we
have
15
remaining
today
in
the
law
school.
if
my
mathematics
are
correct,
there’s
22%
that
are
no
longer
in
the
law
school.
i
don’t
know
why
they’re
not
there,
but
they’re
not
there,
and
counsel
would
have
you
believe
that
they
were
maintaining
their
percentage.
this
does
not
establish
that,
and
i
submit
it
does
not.
now,
may
i
answer
you
question
of
--
i
don’t
remember
exactly
what
it
was,
justice.[laughter]
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
thank
you.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes.
mr.
josef
diamond
you
may,
justice.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
i
think
they
can.
they
apply
them
to
everyone
on
the
same
basis.
mr.
josef
diamond
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
that
is
correct.
it
does
not.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
sir?
mr.
josef
diamond
not
at
that
level.
i
think
an
affirmative
action
program,
and
i
think
that’s
what
you’re
talking
about,
i
think
is
good,
valid,
and
i’m
all
for
it
whether
it’s
for
law
students
or
whether
it’s
for
medical.
and,
i
think
it
should
be
based
not
on
race.
it
should
be
based
on
the
disadvantage,
the
under-privilege,
the
under-cultured,
those
that
need
help,
the
poor,
and
i
think
what
you
should
do
is
go
out
and
recruit
them,
give
them
some
special
training,
some
special
service,
set
up
a
special
category,
make
lawyers
and
make
doctors
out
of
the
people
that
want
to
do
the
things
that
you
want
to
do,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
race,
not
on
the
basis
of
anything
except
the
under-privileged.
mr.
josef
diamond
i’m
not
ready
to
subscribe
to
the
theory
that
minority
clans
are
looking
for
minority
lawyers
or
doctors.
i
think
they
are
looking
for
the
best
qualified
doctors
and
lawyers
to
look
after
their
needs,
and
i
submit
that
they
better
look
for
the
best
qualified
and
not
one
that
matches
their
own
skin
or
color.
mr.
josef
diamond
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
plaintiffs,
petitioners
rather,
brought
this
action
for
the
reason
that
marco
defunis,
jr.
was,
on
two
occasions,
wrongfully
denied
admission
to
the
law
school.
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
mathematical
grades
alone
were
the
sole
admission
criteria
employed
by
the
law
school,
but
the
record
is
clear
that,
taking
all
criteria
in
account,
in
the
law
school’s
own
judgment
its
minority
program
resulted
into
the
admission
of
minority
students
less
qualified
than
non-minority
students
who
were
rejected
particularly
because
there
appears
to
be
some
misconception
of
the
facts
by
many
of
the
amici
briefs,
and
possibly
also
the
respondents.
i’d
like
to
discuss
a
little
bit
of
the
background
and
the
factual
situation
with
reference
to
marco
defunis.
at
the
time
we
agreed
to
represent
marco
defunis,
we
had
not
met
him
and
knew
very
little
about
him.
from
the
facts
related
to
us,
in
which
we
were
later
able
to
verify,
we
were
certain
that
there
was
something
wrong.
marco
attended
grade
school
and
high
school
in
seattle,
was
graduated
from
the
university
of
washington
as
an
honor
student
in
1970.
he
received
phi
beta
capa,
magna
cum
laude,
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
had
worked
20-40
hours
a
week
all
the
time
that
he
was
in
college
as
manual
labor
for
the
park
department
of
the
city.
he
also
taught
sunday
school.
he
had
a
junior-senior
grade
point
average
of
3.71
out
of
a
possible
4
as
calculated
by
the
law
school,
or
a
3.8
when
you
include
9
hours
of
straight-a
he
received
in
latin
in
the
first
quarter
of
his
junior
year
in
the
summer
of
1968,
which
the
law
school
would
not,
for
some
reason,
consider.
in
1971,
after
he
had
been
rejected
by
the
law
school
and
advised
that
if
he
tried
again
the
following
year
there
might
be
room
for
him,
he
went
to
graduate
school
at
the
same
university
of
washington.
he
took
24
hours
of
graduate
work,
again
working
30-40
hours
a
week
with
the
park
department,
and
he
turned
in
grades
of
21
hours
of
a.
at
the
time
of
his
application,
there
were
3
hours
of
incomplete
because
he
hadn’t
got
the
grades
as
yet.
he
had
taken
the
law
school
admissions
test
on
three
occasions
and
received
scores
of
512,
566,
and
568,
and
had
writing
scores
of
62,
58,
and
64.
the
law
school
aptitude
test
of
668,
which
is
the
final
one
he
took,
was
within
the
top
7%
of
all
law
school
applicants
across
the
nation
who
had
ever
taken
it
in
the
past
several
years.
for
defunis
as
well
as
all
other
applicants,
the
junior-senior
grade
point
averages
and
the
lsat
scores
were
combined,
using
a
formula
to
arrive
to
what
was
referred
to
as
a
predicted
first
year
average,
which
in
defunis’
case,
was
76.23.
he
had
little
money,
and
his
wife
worked
as
a
dental
assistant
to
help
him
through
school
and
he
was
also
helped
by
his
parents.
he
didn’t
know
why
he
was
denied
admission
to
the
law
school.
we
didn’t
know
what
his
religion
was,
nor
his
race,
nor
whether
he
belonged
to
a
so-called
minority
group,
nor
what
constituted
a
minority
group.
we
didn’t
think
it
mattered
what
his
religion
was
or
whether
he
was
black,
red,
or
white.
it
was
inconceivable
to
us
that
an
honor
student
with
the
grades
that
he
has:
phi
beta
capa,
magna
cum
laude,
from
the
same
university
would
not
be
qualified
and
would
be
denied
admission
to
the
university
law
school.
to
us,
it
wasn’t
possible
that
all
those
who
were
being
admitted
were
better
qualified
than
defunis.
we
first
met
with
the
dean
of
the
law
school
and
inquired
“what
was
the
basis
of
denial,”
he
had
the
chairman
of
the
admissions
committee?
the
only
answer
we
could
get
was
that
there
were
other
students
better
qualified
than
defunis.
we
told
him
we
couldn’t
accept
that.
we
had
to
see
something
to
verify
that
fact.
the
records
were
confidential.
even
though
we
said
we
weren’t
interested
in
names,
just
records
to
establish
that
there
were
150
or
more
better
qualified.
“no,
that
was
confidential
matters.”
we
next
appeared
and
met
with
the
board
of
regents,
took
his
parents
with
us,
i
don’t
think
we
took
the
boy.
again,
board
of
regents
listened
and
said
they
would
let
us
know,
advised
us
that
“no,”
they
were
going
to
stand
by
the
decision
made
by
the
dean
of
the
law
school
and
the
admissions
committee,
and
that
there
was
no
room
for
marco
defunis.
we
had
no
any
alternative
after
he’d
been
denied
twice,
but
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
and
it
was
only
after
litigation
was
started
and
during
pretrial
discovery
in
the
taking
of
depositions
and
in
fact
only
during
the
trial
itself
that
we’re
able
to
get
a
court
order
requiring
the
university
to
produce
the
files
and
the
records
of
some
of
those
who
were
being
admitted,
and
we
had
to
look
at
them
during
the
noon
hour
because
the
trial
was
in
process
and
the
court
ordered
them
to
be
brought
down
to
the
courtroom,
but
not
all
1,500
or
1,600.
we
settled
for
about
300
or
400
and
during
the
noon
hour,
we
went
through
those
records.
and,
the
record
here
will
show
you
what
we
found
when
we
went
through
them
and
we
put
them
in
evidence
is
who
they
were
taking
into
the
school.
now,
what
the
university
admissions
class
really
did,
they
admitted
two
classes,
not
one.
they
took
the
non-minority
group
and
they
looked
at
their
grades,
and
we’re
not
saying
they
looked
only
at
their
grades
but
what
else
was
there
to
look
at?
there
were
no
personal
interviews.
they
looked
at
their
grades,
and
the
file
they
had
the
grades,
honors,
recommendations,
everybody
had
a
recommendation
that
they
produced,
the
application
of
the
student,
and
that’s
about
all.
and,
they
determined,
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
that
anybody
who
had
a
predicted
first
year
average
of
77
would
automatically
be
admitted
with
a
few
exceptions,
most
of
those
came
in
later,
and
they
actually
admitted
those
too.
so,
everyone
who
had
a
77
or
higher
are
automatically
admitted.
then,
they
took
the
next
list
and
anyone
that
were
75
--
74.5,
they
were
automatically
eliminated
with
the
exception
of
the
minorities.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
there
were
some
returning
servicemen,
except
those
two,
and
we’re
raising
no
question
about
the
returning
servicemen.
mr.
josef
diamond
most
of
them
had
previously
been
admitted
and
they
were
brought
back,
and
we
never
at
any
time
raised
an
issue
about
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
correct
to
look
at
them.
mr.
josef
diamond
we
requested
all
of
the
minority
groups
that
were
brought
in
and
some
of
the
additional
others
that
were
kind
of
at
random.
there
were
1,600.
we
couldn’t
get
them.
we
knew
we
wouldn’t
really
look
at
them
all.
mr.
josef
diamond
and
so,
we
got
those
that
we
could
look
and
we
looked
at
them
in
the
jury
room
during
the
noon
hour
and
there
was
markings
on
the
cover
with
most
of
them.
mr.
josef
diamond
so,
we
could
hurriedly
go
through
it.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
i
believe
so.
now,
when
they
divide
it
into
two
classes,
they
took
the
non-minority
group
and
they
determined
they
were
less
than
between
those
--
between
77
and
74.5
with
the
exception
of
the
minority
groups.
now,
the
minority
groups
they
took,
and
the
black
minority
groups
they
gave
to
one
of
the
admission
members
who
was
a
black
student,
a
freshman
at
the
law
school,
and
gave
him
to
review.
they
took
the
other
non
--
the
other
minority
groups
and
gave
them
to
dean
hunter
on
the
admission
group
and
had
him
review
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
in
the
minority
group,
besides
the
negroes,
they
had
the
chicanos,
the
american-indians,
the
--
mr.
josef
diamond
filipino-americans
and
i
think
that’s
it.
now,
that
too
was
just
an
arbitrary
determination.
so,
out
of
the
total
number
of
minorities
that
had
applied,
there
was
some
70
and
something
like
40
of
those
were
admitted.
something
around
60
or
65,
close
to
70%
of
all
of
the
minorities
that
applied
were
admitted
to
the
law
school,
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
only
something
less
than
10%
of
everyone
else
that
was
admitted.
now,
the
--
as
they
singled
out
the
minorities,
they
were
not
thrown
out
if
they
were
below
74.5,
and
we
find
that
minorities
were
admitted
with
grades
like
69.7,
67.14
compared
to
defunis
with
a
76.23,
when
77
would’ve
admitted
him.
now,
the
--
in
determining
that
the
black-americans
and
the
chicanos
and
the
filipino-americans
and
the
american-indians
were
minority
applicants,
there
wasn’t
any
determine
--
actually,
what
constitute
and
how
would
you
determine
that
you
were
a
black-american
or
you
were
a
chicano?
it’s
not
always
that
easy.
what’s
their
percentages
or
what
not?
well,
you
made
your
own
characterization
on
the
application
blank
as
to
what
you
were,
but
you
weren’t
required
to,
and
no
one
told
anyone
that
if
you
were
one
of
the
minorities,
you’re
going
to
get
special
treatment,
but
you
did
get
special
treatment
and
they
set
up
two
classes.
now,
when
they
had
these
two
classes,
in
order
to
determine
how
many
you’re
going
to
allow
in
from
each
class,
you
had
to
arrive
at
a
racial,
there
was
no
other
way.
you’re
going
to
allow
all
the
minorities
in
or
not,
you
couldn’t.
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they
left
a
great
percentage,
some
60%
of
the
minorities
in
and
only
10%
of
the
whites.
but,
they
had
to
make
a
determination
and
call
it
what
you
please,
is
recorded.
mr.
josef
diamond
these
are
the
ones
that
were
admitted,
that
were
offered
admission,
invited.
yes,
that’s
correct.
they
invited
some
311
and
was
later
stretched
to
330
that
were
invited,
knowing
that
there
was
some
that
would
not
come
into
the
class
and
would
go
elsewhere,
who
had
applied
in
more
than
one
school,
so
that
they
could
reduce
it
down
and
they
would
only
have
approximately
150.
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
i
don’t
think
there
is,
but
there
is
in
the
special
appendix
at
page
44,
i
believe
it
is,
a
list
of
all
those
and
their
qualifications
as
to
how
they
appeared.
mr.
josef
diamond
on
the
application
form
you
were
requested
to
circle
one
of
the
following.
the
afro-american,
american-indian,
caucasian,
mexican,
or
a
mexican-american,
oriental
or
other:
specify
and
you’re
asked
to
either
circle
or
to
specify,
but
it
awarded
its
law
admissions'
preferences
to
black-americans,
chicano-americans,
american-indians,
and
filipino-americans.
now,
an
applicant
couldn’t
characterize
himself
as
a
filipino-american
and,
although
filipino-americans
were
granted
special
admission
preferences,
an
applicant
could
characterize
himself
as
an
oriental-american
but
an
oriental
wasn’t
granted
any
special
preference.
there
was
no
indication
at
anytime
that
the
minorities
would
be
granted
some
preference,
but
you
were
requested
to
fill
that
out
and
you
could
do
so
or
not
as
you
please
and
you
made
your
own
self-determination
as
where
you
belong.
now,
if
marco
had
been
invited
as
one
of
the
three--
mr.
josef
diamond
we
wouldn’t
be
here
today.
mr.
josef
diamond
we
wouldn’t
have
any
problem,
none.
now,
as
there
were
311
and
later
330
who
were
invited
to
be
enrolled,
obviously,
marco
is
very
anxious
to
get
in.
if
he
had
been
invited,
he
would’ve
had
accepted
and
he
would’ve
been
in.
mr.
josef
diamond
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
he
comes
of
jewish
parents.
i
didn’t
know
at
the
time
we
brought
this
action.
i
think,
sephardic
jew,
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
his
parents
lived
in
seattle
for
more
than
50
years.
whether
they
were
born
there,
i’m
not
sure.
he
grew
up
there.
he’s
a
middle
family.
his
father,
i
think,
is
a
furniture
salesman.
he
went
to
school,
as
i
indicated,
worked
all
the
time,
got
help
from
his
parents,
help
from
his
wife
to
get
through
school,
and
made
his
grades
at
the
same
time.
mr.
josef
diamond
was
he
an
underprivileged
or
disadvantaged?
now,
there
was
no
indication
that
the
minorities
that
were
being
helped
were
underprivileged
or
disadvantaged
or
somebody
that
was
poor
or
needed
help.
no
determination
of
any
kind.
if
you
just
fit
in
this
category,
well,
you
got
special
privilege.
mr.
josef
diamond
if
you
just
circle
one
of
those.
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
correct.
they
never
saw
you.
they
didn’t
know
anything
about
you.
now
--
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
mr.
defunis
is
still
in
law
school.
mr.
josef
diamond
it
begins
sometime,
i
believe,
in
february.
this
–
now
--
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
i’m
hoping
that
he
will
graduate.
defunis
is
in
law
school.
now,
you
asked
for
some
briefs
on
the
question
of
mootness
and
we
furnished
them
to
them
--
to
you.
mr.
defunis
will
graduate
in
june,
and
he’s
doing
exceedingly
well,
provided
you
do
not
sustain
the
supreme
court.
if
you
sustain
the
supreme
court,
he
is
only
in
law
school
at
the
present
time
because
we
have
a
stay
signed
by
judge
douglas
or
justice
douglas
which
prevents
the
law
school
and
the
university
from
doing
anything
about
him
being
in
the
school.
i
might
go
back
and
say
that
when
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
reversed
the
lower
court,
we
had
a
problem.
mr.
defunis
was
notified
that
he
better
apply
to
the
school
and
they
would
--
the
admissions
committee,
and
they
would
determine
whether
they’d
let
him
back
in
school
or
not
or
whether
he
could
stay
in
school.
mr.
josef
diamond
right
after
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
entered
their
remitter
and
it
came
down,
and
at
that
time
--
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
right.
he
was
in
his
second
year
in
school
at
that
time.
the
sole
process,
no
fault
of
any
party
on
either
side,
but
the
supreme
court
was
a
little
bit
slower
in
coming
out
with
a
decision
and
marco
was
in
school
all
this
time.
and
when
that
happened,
we
got
a
stay
from
judge
douglas
which
prevented
the
university
from
doing
anything
about
it.
now,
what
they
would’ve
done,
i
don’t
know
but
certainly,
they
had
the
right
and
he
was,
according
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
our
state,
illegally
in
school
and
he
has
been
there
in
the
eyes
of
his
--
the
faculty
and
fellow
students,
illegally
there
because
the
supreme
court
has
said
“you
were
not
rightfully
there,
but
you’re
there
until
this
decision
is
made
by
this
court
pursuant
to
a
stay.”
mr.
josef
diamond
yes.
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
i
believe
that
that
application
for
his
last
quarter,
we
run
in
quarters
at
our
school,
is
sometime
this
month
and
i
assume
that
he
has
applied
because
there’s
a
stay
and
there’s
nothing
to
stop
him.
i
don’t
know.
i
think
he
has
applied
and
i
think
if
he
hasn’t,
he
will
apply.
and,
i
might
also
state
further
--
mr.
josef
diamond
for
the
first
time
--
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
right,
and
i
think
so
he
must
be
due.
i
have
not
been
in
touch
with
him
in
the
last
couple
of
days
i
have
been
here.
i
might
state
further
that,
for
the
first
time,
we
have
something
in
writing.
in
the
brief,
respondent’s
brief,
they
state
that
mr.
marco
defunis
will
graduate.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
think
that’s
right,
but
if
this
court
reverses
this
decision,
and
assuming
they
could
do
it
in
the
next
--
sometime
before
june
or
before
he
gets
his
diploma
--
mr.
josef
diamond
what
have
i
got
to
protect
marco
defunis?
i
don’t
know
who’s
going
to
be.
we
just
had
a
change
in
the
presidency
of
the
university.
we
can
have
a
change
in
the
faculty.
i
have
nothing,
but
a
statement
in
the
brief
that
says
“we’re
going
to
let
him
finish,”
under
a
court
decision
that
says
you
are
illegally
in
the
school.
i
don’t
think
we
can
rely
on
that.
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
and
i
think
there’s
something
more.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
don’t
know.
i
can’t
answer
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
if
this
court
--
mr.
josef
diamond
if
this
court
keeps
the
decision
under
wraps
until
after
june
and
he
gets
his
diploma
and
graduates,
i
don’t
think
even
if
you
then
reverse
it
or
what
happens,
i
don’t
think
anybody
will
come
and
take
his
diploma
away
from
him,
but
he
--
i
don’t
know
whether
you’re
going
to
keep
it
that
long.
i
might
also
say
and
we
have
a
brief,
there’s
more
than
just
this
one
case
now
that
we’ve
got
this
far.
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
it
is
not
a
class
action
and
we’re
not
concerned
with
that.
but,
under
the
authorities
which
we
have
submitted
to
you,
and
i
think
you’ve
reviewed
before
you
called
to
set
this
grant
of
certiorari,
we
did
point
out
that
there
are
other
like
situations
which
are
going
to
come
up
and
that
this
case
ought
to
be
decided.
now,
counsel
has
not
taken
the
position
that
this
case
is
moot.
we
have
not
taken
that
this
--
a
position
that
this
case
is
moot
and
it
is
not,
as
far
as
we’re
concerned.
we
still
have
a
live
situation
in
spite
of
the
statement
which
appeared
just
--
when
we
got
the
respondent’s
brief,
which
was
only
about
two
weeks
ago,
three
weeks
ago,
where
they
stated
that
he
would
stay
in
school
and
finish
if
he
registers,
and
he
probably
has
registered
by
now.
mr.
josef
diamond
oh,
i
can,
but
i
think
you
can
assume
that
he
either
has
or
he
will.
i
don’t
think
anybody
would
stop
at
--
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
of
course
--
mr.
josef
diamond
i’ll
be
glad
to
supply
that
to
you.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
have
no
hesitancy
about
it,
none
whatsoever.
no,
none
whatsoever.
i
just
don’t
have
the
information.
maybe
counsel
has
it.
i’m
assuming
that
he
has
and
i’m
sure
he
has
because
he
was
instructed
to
go
ahead
and
do
it,
and
there’s
no
reason
why
he
shouldn’t.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
would
think
so,
but
i’m
not
too
sure
i
can
answer
that
question.
i
believe,
in
the
state
of
washington,
you
can't
take
the
bar
examination
without
having
a
degree.
i
think
you
can,
through
an
association
with
a
lawyer
obtain
it
and
i
do
believe
that
he
would
be
permitted
to
pass
the
bar.
i
think
though
that
on
the
question
of
mootness,
i
think
we
have
decided
that
or
this
court
has
prior
to
this
time,
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
know
and
have
a
degree
that
he
earned
that
is
legally
his,
and
that
he
has
not
got
it
by
default.
and,
i
think
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondent,
they
say
that
this
question
will
arise
again
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
in
my
office
two
clients,
one
girl
and
one
man,
waiting
for
the
determination
of
this
to
see
whether
they
can
get
into
law
school.
mr.
josef
diamond
oh
no,
not
at
all.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
he’s
earning
them.
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
i’m
not
saying
that
his
degree
would
be
one
by
default.
i
am
saying
that
he
is
in
law
school
illegally.
the
fact
that
he
is
making
his
grades
and
he
is
going
to
get
his
degree
because
he
has
passing
grades
and
i
think
he’s
near
the
top
of
his
class,
so
that
on
that
score
we
will
have
no
problem.
but,
he
is
not
there,
as
far
as
his
faculty
--
the
faculty
is
concerned
and
as
far
as
the
other
students.
he
has
had
a
difficult
time
because
he
is
there
only
because
of
the
time
element
involved
in
getting
this
question
decided,
and
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
have
a
decision
of
this
court
saying
that
he
is
rightfully
there.
now,
i
did
want
to
make
sure
because
i
don’t
know
just
how
the
respondents
are
going
to
present
this
matter,
but
i
do
want
the
court
to
understand
that
it
isn’t
--
there’s
no
question
in
this
case
but
what
the
minorities
were
given
per
--
preferential
treatment
and
that
mr.
defunis,
if
he
was
black,
he
would’ve
been
admitted
in
the
school.
the
lower
court
found
that.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
found
that.
now,
the
only
thing
they
said,
he
was
given
--
in
the
supreme
court,
he
was
given
preference.
he
was
given
special
--
the
blacks
were
given
special
treatment
and
the
minorities,
and
the
only
reason
that
they
reversed
the
lower
court
was
that
they
said
there
was
an
overriding
public
interest
and
i
submit
and
we’ve
set
it
forth
in
the
briefs
that
there
cannot
be
an
overriding
public
interest
on
this
question
to
admit
those
who
are
not
equally
qualified
into
the
law
school,
and
that’s
the
only
basis
and
the
only
reason
our
supreme
court
allowed
reversal
of
that
case.
and,
i
want
to
be
sure
that
we
understand
the
testimony
of
professor
kumer
--
mr.
josef
diamond
yes?
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
sir.
i’m
not
saying
that.
i
am
saying
that
they’ve
got
treat
everybody
alike
and
they’re
not
going
to
set
up
two
classes,
one
minority
and
one
non-minority.
they
can
set
up
any
test
they
like
and
their
going
to
have
to,
in
my
opinion,
going
to
treat
them
alike
and
not
treat
them
as
two
separate
classes
as
they
did
here.
you
had
two
separate
groups,
separate
tests,
and
separate
consideration
for
each
of
these
two
groups.
and,
that,
i
think
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
a
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
which
we
have
pointed
out.
mr.
josef
diamond
that’s
right.
that
was
found
in
the
lower
court.
it
was
also
found
in
the
supreme
court
of
our
state,
and
the
only
reason
they
didn’t
was
they
found
an
overriding
public
interest
to
try
and
do
something
for
past
discrimination
against
minority
students,
of
which
of
course,
defunis
had
nothing
to
do
with.
now,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
any
effort
that
you
can
on
the
affirmative
program
to
try
and
help
minorities.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
and
we
didn’t
even
know
we’re
in
a
minority
case
when
we
tried
to
get
mr.
defunis
into
this
law
school.
we
have
no
quarrel
and
there
are
plenty
of
affirmative
action
programs
that
can
be
undertaken
to
get
more
minorities
into
the
law
schools,
and
we
are
in
favor
of
that.
we’re
not
suggesting
for
a
moment,
that
you
shouldn’t
have
it,
but
we
do
not
think
that
you
can
use
race
to
--
and
to
keep
out
one
group
solely
and
only
because
of
race,
and
that’s
what
was
done
here.
if
defunis
had
been
black,
he
would’ve
been
in.
he
was
kept
out
because
he
was
white.
the
only
reason
he
was
kept
out,
no
other
reason.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
better
save
a
little
time,
thank
you.
mr.
josef
diamond
thank
you.
counsel
has
stated
that
a
number
of
minority
students
or
a
number
of
non-minority
students
that
had
grades
below
74.5
were
accepted.
i
call
court’s
attention
to
schedule
a
in
the
single
appendix
at
page
37,
and
there
it
lists
all
of
those
who
were
admitted
to
the
class
as
of
august
1,
1971
and
you’ll
find
that
not
a
single
non-minority
student
was
accepted
with
grades
anywhere
near
as
low
as
--
that
were
accepted
for
the
minorities.
they’re
all
spelled
out
and
there
isn’t
one.
i
also
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
do
not
contend
that
the
applicants
were
accepted
on
grades
alone
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
was
not
that
they
accepted
students
with
lower
grades
alone,
they
accepted
lower
--
students
with
lower
grades
and
qualifications.
they
examined
the
entire
record
on
all
the
students,
the
minorities
and
the
non-minorities,
and
they
accepted
those
with
lower
grades.
the
same
question
answers
the
other
one
as
to
who
set
up
this
policy.
the
question,
which
is
in
the
record,
was
asked
of
the
president
of
the
law
school,
mr.
odegaard,
in
connection
with
the
new
policy
with
reference
to
minorities
that
you
have
approved.
mr.
josef
diamond
the
president
of
the
university,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
josef
diamond
excuse
me,
president
of
the
law
school.[attempt
to
laughter]
if
the
new
policy
with
reference
to
minorities
--
university,
i’m
sorry,
that
you
have
approved
and
the
regents
have
approved
or
adopted,
whether
that
policy
permits
the
law
school
admissions
to
admit
minority
students
with
lower
grades
and
qualifications
and
the
other
students.
and,
his
answer
was
“i
think
it
does,”
and
the
same
thing
with
reference
to
dean
ronis.
when
he
was
the
dean
of
the
law
school,
he
testified
to
the
same
thing,
and
the
court
found
--
the
lower
court
found
and
the
supreme
court
found
that
they
were
allowing
students
in
with
lower
grades
and
qualifications.
we’re
not
just
talking
about
mechanical
grades.
the
question
was
asked
and
counsel
made
the
statement
--
mr.
josef
diamond
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
the
qualifications
are
what
were
in
their
application
file,
filled
out
by
them.
the
recommendations
that
they
furnished
their
grades,
their
honors,
the
courses
that
they
took
are
listed
along
with
their
grades
that
were
submitted,
and
their
work
habits.
as
was
shown
there,
defunis
worked.
mr.
josef
diamond
no,
sir.
the
record
shows
that
that’s
all
that
the
admissions
committee
had
to
look
at.
mr.
josef
diamond
how
do
we
know
what?
mr.
josef
diamond
because
the
university,
in
their
testimony
stated
so.
the
president
said
so,
dean
ronis
said
so,
the
chairman,
mr.
--
professor
kumer
said
so
that
they
were
accepted.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
without
qualifications,
they
testified
that
students
with
lower
qualifications
and
without
lower
grades
were
accepted.
they
did,
and
they
said
that
they
were
reaching
out
to
get
more.
mr.
josef
diamond
they
had
nothing
else
to
go
on.
there
couldn’t
be
anything
else.
all
they
had
was
the
same
thing
that
they
had
with
reference
to
mr.
defunis.
one
other
thing
--
mr.
josef
diamond
in
some
case,
and
that
one
i
read,
but
the
others
it
was
not.
it
was
--
in
dean
futeus
it
was
not
--
in
dean
ronis
it
was
not.
he
testified
to
it
himself.
the
other
question
that
was
asked
--
mr.
josef
diamond
well,
that’s
a
relative
matter.
the
university
testified
that
they
were
qualified
for
the
law
school,
but
it’s
a
relative
matter.
they
set
up
these
two
classes.
if
they
took
those
that
had
better
qualifications
as
they
admitted,
they
wouldn’t
have
had
room
for
these.
so,
they
had
to
set
up
a
ratio
between
them.
if
they
did
say
and
they
did
testify
that
any
of
the
1,600
they
thought
could
have
maintained
themselves
in
school,
and
would’ve
passed.
but,
you’ve
got
a
relative
situation.
you
can’t
take
1,600.
so,
they
were
--
should
be
taking,
we
would
assume,
the
better
qualified,
not
necessarily
the
better
grades.
mr.
josef
diamond
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
record
and
you
look
at
the
findings
of
the
courts,
you’ll
find
that
they
did
not.
mr.
josef
diamond
the
university’s
goals?
mr.
josef
diamond
let
me
--
mr.
josef
diamond
let
me
answer
that
with
this
--
mr.
josef
diamond
i
think
if
they
use
the
same
test
for
everyone,
they
would
have
that
right,
but
let
me
answer
you
that
with
this
notation
--
mr.
josef
diamond
whatever
they
use,
when
you
have
1,600
people
making
application,
and
you
only
have
room
for
150,
you’re
going
to
have
to
make
some
determination
of
which
are
the
best
qualified.
now,
the
only
thing
we’ve
got
here
is
the
president
of
the
university,
the
dean
of
the
law
school,
the
chairman
of
the
admissions
committee
telling
us
that
they
did
not
select
the
best
qualified
students.
i
can’t
give
you
any
more
than
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
let
me
--
mr.
josef
diamond
we
got
enough.
mr.
josef
diamond
well
--
mr.
josef
diamond
let
me
cover
this
one
for
just
a
moment.
on
january
9,
1974
--
mr.
josef
diamond
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
i
owned
there
for
two.
on
january
9,
1974,
i
requested
and
received
a
letter
from
the
attorney
general
with
reference
to
the
19
specially
admitted
students,
and
this
is
what
they
tell
me.
“of
the
19
specially
admitted
in
the
class
commencing
september
1971,
10
of
whom
are
black,
3
chicano,
3
asian-american,
3
native-american,
15
are
currently
enrolled
in
the
law
school,
7
of
whom
are
black,
3
chicano,
3
asian-americans,
and
2
native-americans.
now,
out
of
the
19
then
we
have
15
remaining
today
in
the
law
school.
if
my
mathematics
are
correct,
there’s
22%
that
are
no
longer
in
the
law
school.
i
don’t
know
why
they’re
not
there,
but
they’re
not
there,
and
counsel
would
have
you
believe
that
they
were
maintaining
their
percentage.
this
does
not
establish
that,
and
i
submit
it
does
not.
now,
may
i
answer
you
question
of
--
i
don’t
remember
exactly
what
it
was,
justice.[laughter]
what
was
that?
mr.
josef
diamond
thank
you.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes.
mr.
josef
diamond
you
may,
justice.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
i
think
they
can.
they
apply
them
to
everyone
on
the
same
basis.
mr.
josef
diamond
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
josef
diamond
that
is
correct.
it
does
not.
mr.
josef
diamond
yes,
sir?
mr.
josef
diamond
not
at
that
level.
i
think
an
affirmative
action
program,
and
i
think
that’s
what
you’re
talking
about,
i
think
is
good,
valid,
and
i’m
all
for
it
whether
it’s
for
law
students
or
whether
it’s
for
medical.
and,
i
think
it
should
be
based
not
on
race.
it
should
be
based
on
the
disadvantage,
the
under-privilege,
the
under-cultured,
those
that
need
help,
the
poor,
and
i
think
what
you
should
do
is
go
out
and
recruit
them,
give
them
some
special
training,
some
special
service,
set
up
a
special
category,
make
lawyers
and
make
doctors
out
of
the
people
that
want
to
do
the
things
that
you
want
to
do,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
race,
not
on
the
basis
of
anything
except
the
under-privileged.
mr.
josef
diamond
i’m
not
ready
to
subscribe
to
the
theory
that
minority
clans
are
looking
for
minority
lawyers
or
doctors.
i
think
they
are
looking
for
the
best
qualified
doctors
and
lawyers
to
look
after
their
needs,
and
i
submit
that
they
better
look
for
the
best
qualified
and
not
one
that
matches
their
own
skin
or
color.
