mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
brooks
patterson.
i
am
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
oakland
county
in
michigan,
representing
the
people
of
the
state
of
michigan
in
this
appeal.
before
stating
the
facts,
there
are
four
dates
that
i
would
like
to
stress
because
they
have
a
bearing
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
logically
they
are
the
date
of
the
escobedo
decision
in
june
of
1964;
secondly,
the
date
of
the
offense
in
this
particular
case,
april
19,
1966;
third,
the
date
of
the
miranda
decision,
june
13,
1966;
and
finally,
the
date
of
the
commencement
of
trial
of
the
tucker
case,
october
18,
1966.
the
facts
of
the
case:
on
april
19,
1966,
it
is
undisputed
that
marline
cory
(ph)
was
brutally
beaten
and
raped
in
her
home
in
which
she
lived
by
herself.
she
was
beaten
so
badly
that
she
was
never
able
to
remember
nor
did
she
recall
the
time
that
she
testified
and
make
any
identification
of
the
defendant
as
her
assailant.
she
was
discovered
in
her
home
by
a
co-worker
who
summoned
the
police.
this
co-worker
also
noticed
inside
her
home
a
dog
and
since
miss
cory
did
not
own
a
pet,
he
brought
this
to
the
attention
of
the
police.
the
police
followed
this
dog
to
the
residence
of
the
defendant,
thomas
wayne
tucker.
after
making
inquiries
with
the
neighbors
about
the
ownership
of
that
particular
dog,
the
police
put
out
a
broadcast
to
pick
up
the
defendant
and
later
that
day,
he
was
arrested
and
brought
to
the
police
station.
before
any
interrogation
of
the
defendant,
he
was
advised
of
his
rights
as
delineated
at
that
time
by
the
escobedo
decision.
specifically,
he
was
advised
of
his
right
to
remain
silent,
that
anything
he
said
would
be
used
against
him
at
the
court
of
law,
and
that
he
had
the
right
to
an
attorney.
it
was
not
advised,
however,
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
court
appointed
attorney,
but
that
right
was
yet
to
be
mandated
in
the
miranda
decision
two
months
hence.
during
the
interrogation
that
followed,
the
defendant
said
that
he
had
obtained
the
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
but
not
at
--
in
no
specific
words
then
and
there.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
during
the
interrogation
that
followed,
the
defendant
told
the
police
that
he
had
obtained
the
noticeable
scratches
on
his
face
from
the
flarings
of
a
goose
that
he
had
killed.
and
this
would
also
account
for
the
blood
on
his
clothing.
he
said
that
all
of
these
could
be
confirmed
by
one
robert
henderson,
who
he
was
with
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
rape
and
thereby
creating
an
alibi.
later
the
next
day,
in
an
effort
to
confirm
that
alibi,
the
police
sought
out
and
talked
to
one
robert
henderson,
who
not
only
failed
to
corroborate
the
story
told
by
the
defendant
tucker,
but
actually
gave
testimony
or
a
statement
that
refuted
tucker’s
claim.
henderson
indicated
to
the
police
that
indeed
he
did
have
a
conversation
with
the
defendant
on
april
19,
1966
and
that
he
had
asked
the
defendant
how
it
came
that
he
had
these
scratches
on
his
face
and
whether
he
had
gotten
hold
of
a
wild
one
or
something,
to
which
the
defendant
tucker
replied
something
like
that,
and
then
moments
later
added,
“she
was
the
widowed
woman
in
her
thirties
who
lived
the
next
block
over.”
the
case
went
to
trial
several
months
later
on
october
18,
1966.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
this
was
a
sheriff’s
department
case
in
pontiac
township,
just
outside
the
city
of
pontiac.
on
october
18th,
it
went
to
trial
and
because
of
the
intervening
decision
of
miranda,
none
of
the
statements
made
by
defendant
tucker
were
introduced
into
evidence.
however,
henderson
was
called
as
a
prosecution
witness
and
did
testify.
the
defendant
was
convicted
by
a
jury
trial
and
sentenced
to
a
prison
term
of
20-40
years
in
view
of
his
record.
both
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
affirmed
that
conviction
with
unanimous
opinions.
upon
application
by
the
defendant
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
petition
was
granted
under
the
theory
that
henderson’s
testimony
had
been
improperly
admitted
into
evidence
by
the
trial
court
because
of
the
trial
court's
failure
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
opinion
and
we
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
by
this
court
on
december
3,
1973.
we
raise
three
issues
this
morning
in
our
argument
and
first
is
the
question
of
the
retroactivity
of
miranda.
one
week
after
the
miranda
case
was
decided,
this
court
held
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey
that
miranda
would
be
applicable
to
all
those
trials
that
commenced
after
the
decision
date
in
miranda.
i
think
you
can
see
from
that
dates
that
i
had
set
out
when
i
first
commenced,
that
we
were
caught
in
a
limbo
situation.
we
had
an
interrogation
under
escobedo
on
april
19.
miranda
came
down
in
june
and
we
commenced
trial
in
october
and
even
though
johnson
said
for
the
proposition
that
miranda
would
be
prospective
in
its
application,
we
were
experiencing
retroactive
effect
because
we
were
caught
in
this
limbo.
and
this
is
the
particular
injustice
in
this
case
that
we
complain
about
this
morning,
that
at
the
time
the
police
were
interrogating
the
defendant,
tucker,
he
was
properly
advised
of
his
escobedo
rights
and
the
police
at
that
time
were
doing
nothing
wrong.
and
now
by
operation
of
the
johnson
case
and
its
retroactive
effect,
we
are
being
told
that
the
interrogation
is
illegal.
we
feel
that
the
court
should
modify
this
retroactive
application
of
johnson
because
it
places
the
--
this
court
in
the
position,
and
the
local
court
in
the
position
of
saying
that,
tucker’s
interrogation
was
improper,
but
it
only
became
improper
by
operation
of
an
ex
post
facto
type
situation.
we
feel
that
to
make
johnson
or
the
effect
of
johnson
to
conform
to
its
rationale
and
make
it
prospective
would
be
in
order.
the
court
had
done
this
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
we
do
not
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
takes
me
immediately
to
the
second
issue
which
i
think
is
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
it
should
be
and
as
such
overruled
because
i
think
the
court
had
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
when
i
said
overrule,
i
should
have
use
a
activity
date
as
opposed
to
a
trial
date.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
i
wouldn’t
believe
that
many,
your
honor.
the
second
issue
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
your
honor,
i
personally
do
not.
i’ve
been
involved
with
prosecution
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
that
is
right.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
that’s
correct.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
i
would
hope
so.
your
honor,
the
second
issue
is
the
doctrine
that
you
just
mentioned
would
be
the
application
of
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine.
and
more
specifically,
we
raise
the
question,
whether
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
should
be
applied
to
the
testimony
on
the
identity
of
a
witness,
who
was
discovered
during
what
is
now
declared
to
be
an
improper
interrogation.
the
solicitor
general
has
intervened
on
this
particular
issue
and
will
be
arguing
as
well
on
this
point.
so,
i’d
like
to
highlight
some
of
the
more
salient
points
of
our
brief.
this
precise
question
of
witness
testimony
being
suppressed
under
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
as
yet
to
be
presented
to
this
court
and
i
take
that
lead
from
the
footnote
in
harrison
versus
united
states,
392
us
in
footnote
9.
it
would
be,
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
to
a
witness
who
testifies,
i
think
it
would
be
unwarranted
extension
of
that
particular
doctrine.
it
would
be
unwarranted
because
the
immediate
distinction
is
that
in
this
type
of
situation
with
henderson,
we
have
the
testimony
of
a
live
witness.
and
i
do
not
feel
that
we
should
automatically
equate
a
live
witness
and
all
of
that
and
suggest
the
fact
that
he
has
own,
a
memory,
and
his
own
perception
and
his
own
will
and
his
own
intellect
which
are
all
going
to
interact
down
there
when
personally
he
takes
his
stand.
we
should
not
equate
that
type
of
a
human
being
with
physical
evidence
automatically
because
we
have
at
least
that
distinguishing
characteristics
which
makes
a
human
being
unique.
arguably
is
the
fact
that
this
witness
when
he
comes
into
court
and
takes
the
stand,
he’s
going
to
be
subject
to
the
rigors
of
cross
examination
by
defense
counsel.
he
is
subject
to
impeachment
and
all
the
other
devices
that
defense
counsel
has
to
cross
examine
and
that
this
was
done
in
the
case
of
henderson
when
he
took
the
stand
before
the
jury.
and
that
he
--
a
witness
has
the
ability
to
have
come
forward
on
his
own
possibly
as
contrary
to
physical
evidence,
but
i
think
more
importantly
is
the
fact
that
when
henderson’s
name
was
brought
up
by
the
defendant
tucker,
at
that
point,
the
name
henderson
was
at
no
evidentiary
value
as
such.
it
is
not
evidence
the
mere
mentioning
of
a
name.
it
is
not
evidence
per
se.
by
the
independent
labors
of
the
police
who
sought
him
out
and
talked
to
him,
at
that
point,
he
begins
to
become
significance
and
when
he
comes
in
the
court
and
testifies,
he
then
becomes
evidence.
and
i
believe
this
court,
addressed
this
particular
problem
in
a
case
one
week
after
miranda
which
would
be
june
20,
1966
in
schmerber.
in
the
case
--
in
the
language
in
schmerber
said
that,
“the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
abide
to
compelling
one
to
be
a
witness
to
give
testimony,”
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
but
it
is
not
a
bar
against
that
compulsion
which
makes
the
witness
or
the
defendant
or
the
accused
the
source
of
real
or
physical
evidence.
and
in
this
case,
tucker
was
the
source
we
admit
of
henderson’s
identity,
but
it
is
not
evidence
the
mere
mentioning
of
that
name.
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
rather
than
being
extended
should
be
curtailed
and
i
think
is
being
curtailed
in
decisions
by
this
court.
and
i
would
say
to
court,
couple
of
the
prime
examples
would
be
the
case
of
harris
versus
new
york
in
1970
when
the
court
permitted
the
prosecution
to
use
for
impeachment
at
the
prior
statement
of
the
defendant
which
it
was
not
being
permitted
to
use
in
itscase,
case
in
chief.
even
though,
i
think
there
would
be
the
illegal
fruit,
it
was
still
being
--
the
prosecutor
was
is
being
allowed
some
use
of
it.
in
u.s
versus
calandra
evidence
which
was
illegally
obtained
during
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
was
still
being
permitted
to
be
brought
before
a
grand
jury
for
the
use
of
that
grand
jury
in
its
investigation.
the
court
--
this
court
has
developed
as
well
as
some
of
the
lower
federal
district
courts,
i
think
theories
which
are
now
doctrines
of
law
which
permit
or
avoid
the
harsh
application
of
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine;
such
theories
as
attenuation
or
the
independent
source.
these
rules
are
being
carved
out
judicially
from
the
announced
doctrine
in
order
to
avoid
the
extreme
and
i
think
harsh
application
of
the
automatic
exclusion
of
evidence
by
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine.
but
in
the
case
that
we
have,
in
the
case
of
michigan
versus
tucker,
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
and
the
purpose
of
that
application
of
that
doctrine
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct.
in
this
particular
instance,
it
would
be
itself
unreasonable
and
unfair
because
the
police
first
of
all
would
not
have
engaged
in
any
misconduct.
the
interrogation
of
tucker
met
the
standards
then
in
force
under
escobedo.
and
secondly,
when
they
went
out
to
talk
to
henderson,
this
witness,
they
were
following
what
was
the
alibi
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
had
given
a
exculpatory
remark
and
the
police
went
out
to
check
that
alibi.
and
how
they
checked
out,
it
would
have
been
a
good
probable
belief
that
tucker
would
have
released
had
his
alibi
been
confirmed
and
if
the
police
had
ignored
that
exculpatory
remark,
they
would
have
been
developed
that
responsibility.
the
final
issue
that
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
was
the
question
of
miranda
itself
and
we
pose
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
absolutely,
your
honor
and
it
would
be
very
unfair
and
obviously
unethical
thing
for
the
prosecution
or
the
police
to
have
even
consider
to
hide
the
witness
which
would
have
been
a
benefit
to
the
defendant.
and
this
is
again,
we
are
now
telling
them,
you’ve
done
something
improper
when
actually
what
they
were
doing
was
being
proper
and
very
ethical.
the
question
we
raised
with
regard
to
miranda,
was
whether
the
standards
which
were
enunciated
in
miranda,
whether
they
are
too
restrictive
and
they
are
exclusion
of
admissions
and
whether
they
are
mandated
by
the
us
constitution.
although,
majority
writing
in
miranda
i
think
answer
the
second
half
of
that
question,
when
they
said
that
we
do
not
consider
or
we
cannot
say
that
the
constitution
necessarily
requires
adherence
to
any
particular
solution
for
the
inherent
compulsion
of
the
interrogation
process.
and
those
words,
i
think
they
admitted
that
the
constitution
did
not
require
the
standards
that
they
developed,
but
this
was
a
judicially
developed
framework
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
other
half
of
the
question
are
the
standards
set
forth
in
miranda
too
restrictive
and
i
think
at
this
point
it's
undebatable
that
the
standards
which
were
enunciated
in
miranda
tolerate
no
deviance
and
the
way
the
phrases
were
couched,
they
were
couched
with
the
use
of
the
word
“must.”
these
warnings
must
be
given,
waivers
must
be
obtained
and
if
there
is
any
indication
he
does
not
want
proceed,
you
must
end
your
interrogation.
so,
what
the
court
did
in
this
instance
whereas
to
develop
an
absolute
and
flexible
and
rigid
test
and
the
court
took
what
used
to
be
a
circumstances
the
court
would
look
to,
the
advising
of
certain
constitutional
rights,
it
elevated
these
in
the
form
of
standards
what
are
now
almost
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
the
violation
of
which
results
in
the
automatic
exclusion
of
a
statement
made
by
the
defendant
regardless
of
that
statement
might
in
fact
be
voluntary.
the
supreme
court
way
back
in
1883
in
hopp
versus
utah
i
think
it
said
that
the
dealing
with
the
question
of
confessions
that
we
have
wisely
fore
born
to
mark
with
absolute
precision
the
limits
of
admission
and
exclusion,
and
i
think
they
fore
saw
the
problem
when
you
do
mark
with
a
rigid
test
what
is
going
to
be
admissible
and
what
isn’t.
what
now
happens
in
the
trial
court
and
i’m
sure
this
court
is
aware
of
it,
the
focus
is
shifted
from
the
will
of
the
accused
or
what
is
on
his
mind
or
why
he
made
a
statement
and
the
first
focus
is
now
on
to
the
conduct
of
the
police
officer
and
we’d
look
to
see
what
he
did
or
how
he
acted
in
order
to
determine
if
this
man
made
a
voluntary
statement.
well,
actually
the
test
that
police
officer
goes
through,
the
advisement
of
those
four
rights
in
the
obtaining
of
a
waiver
is
not
really
bearing
upon
the
question,
is
this
a
voluntary
confession
and
the
police
officers
scrutiny,
if
he
makes
one
fatal
mistake
in
the
advising
of
the
rights
and
later
when
he
testifies
in
court,
at
the
trial
court
in
a
hearing
like
jackson
v.
denno,
we
call
walker
hearing.
if
he
testifies
in
his
hearing
about
voluntariness
and
makes
one
mistake
and
how
he
said
he
gave
his
rights,
the
court
stops,
at
that
point,
it
is
inquiry
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
and
because
the
miranda
standards
had
been
violated,
maybe
one
had
been
omitted
or
had
been
incorrectly
testified
to,
the
inquiry
stops
and
because
of
that
deviation
from
the
standard
set
forth,
the
court,
trial
court
will
exclude
any
statement
made
by
the
accused.
the
test
is
no
longer
now.
and
miranda,
i
believe
was
supposed
to
take
us
away
from
looking
at
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
we
are
supposed
to
look
into
this
condition
precedent
before
we
get
to
the
confession.
there
is
now
a
condition
preceding
namely
the
four
rights
the
officer
makes
and
miranda
was
supposed
to
take
us
away
from
examining
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
make
a
very
simple
to
determine
if
indeed
a
voluntary
statement
was
made.
and
the
old
test
of
looking
to
the
defendant
to
see
if
his
will
was
over
borne
or
if
there
was
any
inducement
or
coercion
upon
him
or
any
threats
to
make
him,
make
a
statement
or
obtain
a
weaver,
were
supposed
to
have
been
taken
out
of
the
examination
of
voluntariness.
but
in
fact,
i
think
that
they
we’re
fooling
ourselves
if
we
don’t
realize
that
we
are
still
in
the
trial
court
and
very
much
immersed
in
a
total
circumstances
examination,
a
totality
of
circumstances.
we
still
look
to
all
these
factors
and
in
determining
whether
the
rights
were
properly
administered.
we
still,
the
court
will
still
look
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
to
see
how
the
rights
were
administered.
were
they
administered
after
three
days
of
incommunicado
interrogation
or
were
they
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
the
warnings,
yes.
and
so,
even
though
the
warnings
are
there
and
a
condition
preceding
to
get
into
the
level
of
examining
the
voluntaries,
the
court
still
brings
in
all
these
circumstance
of
how
that
officer
gave
his
rights,
when
did
he
give
the
defendant
his
rights,
under
what
circumstances
were
the
rights
administered
and
was
he
intoxicated
and
so
forth.
i
think
mr.
justice
white
in
his
dissent
foresaw
some
of
these
problems
when
he
wrote,
“today’s
decision
leaves
open
such
questions
as
whether
the
accused
was
in
custody,
whether
his
statements
were
spontaneous
or
the
product
of
interrogation,
whether
the
accused
has
effectively
waived
his
rights
and
whether
non-testimony
of
the
evidence
introduced
at
trail
is
the
fruit
of
statements
made
during
a
prohibited
interrogation”
and
mr.
justice
white
was
absolutely
correct.
we
now
have
these
mini
trials
and
the
prosecution
must
prevail
in
everyone
of
this
questions
and
more
and
should
we
feel
on
just
one
of
these
questions,
even
though
we
might
prevail
on
six,
if
we
miss
on
one
of
these
mini
trials,
at
that
point
the
inquiry
ends
and
the
judge
automatically
excludes
the
statement
that
was
obtained
as
a
fruit
or
as
a
illegal
confession.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
i
can
give
a
case,
a
specific
case
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
your
honor,
but
you
wouldn’t
see
if
the
court
has
overruled
that
way
and
i’m
sure
they
have.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
oh
yes,
i
am
surely
they
have
in
some
instances
when
the
court
has
found
it
involuntary
not
because
the
rights
were
violated
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
your
honor,
i
would
cite
this
case
as
an
example
when
at
that
point
in
time
in
1966,
all
the
rights
have
been
incumbent
upon
the
police
to
be
administered
were
given
and
now
we
find
that
the
statement
in
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
oh,
yes
and
the
statement
that
the
tucker
made
was
never
used,
any
his
remarks
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
that’s
correct.
the
rights,
the
warnings
that
had
to
be
properly
administered
were
not
technically
given
and
therefore
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
that
part
is
not.
the
totality
of
circumstances,
the
examination
of
all
the
factors
surrounding
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
a
manageable
test
and
it
is
still
being
used
again,
the
totality
to
examine
how
the
warnings
were
given.
and
this
court
has
reaffirmed
the
viability
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
as
recently
as
the
bustemonte
case
where
totality
of
circumstances
were
examined
to
determine
if
proper
consent
had
been
obtained
in
order
to
make
a
search.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
it
did.
but
i
am
going
out
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
as
being
the
test
that
the
court
found
it
a
manageable
and
a
workable
test
to
examine
the
circumstances
under
which
the
defendant
then
gave
his
consent.
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
barker
v.
wingo
and
again
this
court,
use
the
totality
of
circumstances
rather
than
a
fixed
rule
to
determine
whether
the
defendant
had
been
denied
his
right
of
a
speedy
trial.
i
suggest
that
we
adopt
and
we
move
forward
to
a
flexible
standard
of
looking
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
use
the
miranda
warnings
as
criteria
in
determining
whether
the
defendant
had
been
properly
advised
and
whether
they
had
given
proper
consent
to
waive
his
rights
to
remain
silent.
and
that
--
i
adopt
the
language
out
of
the
omnibus
crime
and
control
and
safe
streets
act
where
they
say,
“that
the
absence
of
anyone
of
these
particular
warnings
should
not
be
this
sole
determining
factor
on
the
admissibility
of
that
confession
but
ought
to
be
a
factor
that
the
judge
takes
into
consideration
in
determining
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.”
what
is
wrong
with
the
warnings
as
they
are
required
today
is
what
we
find
wrong
in
the
tucker
situation.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
that
marline
cory
was
raped
and
there’s
no
question
that
the
defendant
found,
the
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
that
offense.
and
there’s
no
question
that
the
police
were
engaged
at
that
time
in
a
proper
pre-miranda
situation
having
advised
him
of
his
rights
under
escobedo.
and
there’s
no
question
that
the
police
were
doing
something
very
proper
in
going
out,
checking
out
his
alibi
which
might
well,
have
exculpated
him.
but
there
is
a
question
that
if
the
warnings
which
are
now
required
in
the
rigid
test
that
there
are
in
the
miranda
doctrine,
if
they
are
continued
to
be
enforced
in
the
form
that
they
are
as
the
sole
criteria
in
determining
admissibility,
there
is
going
to
be
a
question
that
marline
cory
and
the
people
in
the
state
of
michigan
could
have
their
day
in
court.
but,
the
bigger
question
is
that
in
the
other
cases
that
come
after
this
one
whether
defendants
who
are
only
tied
to
their
case
by
an
admission
can
ever
be
brought
to
justice.
thank
you.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
time
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
that’s
right
your
honor.
if
given
the
court,
i
think
several
arguments
anyone
of
which
would
allow
tucker
case
to
be,
the
conviction
which
would
be
affirmed
and
we
felt
that
the
miranda
issue
did
have
a
bearing
because
that’s
up
to
the
second
issue
itself
and
that’s
how
we
got
into
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
because
of
a
violation
of
warnings
on
the
miranda
doctrine.
thank
you.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’ll
say
two
points
raised
by
counsels
for
the
respondent
as
they
raise
in
seriatim.
the
first
one
that
mr.
mogill
mentioned
to
the
court
was
a
stipulation
that
appears
in
the
brown
appendix
on
page
29,
where
in
his
formation
of
the
question,
he
said
that
what
we
stipulated
right
there,
there
was
no
independent
source.
and
since
there
could
be
no
independent
source,
that
is
not
our
stipulation.
our
stipulation
was,
i
think
as
one
of
the
justices
indicated
was
that
we
admit
that
we
learned
of
henderson
only
through
tucker
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
could
not
have
come
forward
or
would
not
have
come
forward
on
his
own
because
if
he’s
now,
as
your
particular
facts
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
at
that
particular
time,
that’s
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
next
point
raised
by
mr.
mogill
was
that
the
granting
or
failure
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
to
witness'
testimony
would
undermine
the
deterrent
purpose
of
that
particular
rule.
and
i
think
there’s
a
presumption
here
that
the
police
are
therefore
going
to
go
out
and
violate
miranda
in
the
hopes
of
finding
evidence
of
a
third
independent
witness
type
and
then
use
him.
that’s
not
a
very
good
assumption
to
make
that
police
are
going
to
deliberately
violate
the
miranda
doctrine
in
the
hopes
of
finding
a
third
witness
which
the
rule
doesn’t
apply
to.
obviously
that
the
police
are
going
to
try
in
all
the
interrogations
to
say
within
the
guidelines
as
the
police
did
in
this
particular
case
of
interrogating
tucker
in
april.
the
--
mr.
mogill
also
indicated
that
the
miranda
has
not
been
harmful
as
did
mr.
gribbs.
it
has
had
not
any
harmful
effect.
he
said
there
was
no
evidence
as
such.
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
that
here’s
a
case
before
you
where
we
have,
i
think,
a
detriment
to
certainly
the
interest
of
justice,
sort
of
ms
cory
is
concerned
and
the
interest
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
michigan
because
we’re
here.
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
with
us
by
the
international
association
of
chiefs
of
police
on
page
18
and
19,
and
20
and
21,
set
forth
nine
or
ten
cases
where
the
miranda,
technical
violation
in
how
the
rights
were
administered
resulted
in
a
confession
being
suppressed
in
the
case
either
being
dismissed
or
sent
back
for
re-trial,
many
instances
tantamount
to
dismissal.
mr.
gribbs
in
his
argument
said
that
these
studies
show
that
there
has
been
no
depreciable
effect
on
law
enforcement
and
he
cites
the
pittsburgh
study
and
in
pittsburgh,
in
that
particular
study,
they
called
the
remark
that
tucker
gave,
an
exculpatory
statement,
they
didn’t
include
that.
they
said,
“well,
we
won't
consider
that
a
statement
or
admission
or
confession
purposes
of
this
survey.”
so
that,
that
report
really
is
inapplicable
to
the
situations
of
this
case.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
your
honor,
i
have
no
intention
of
ever
violating
or
whatever
foreclose
to
come
before
this
court
and
suggest
that
we
would
want
to
compel
somebody
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
trial.
i
do
not
see
that
that
is
a
situation
in
this
particular
instance.
i
safeguard
the
constitution
and
the
board
of
rights
as
much
any
lawyer
or
any
member
of
the
bar.
but
i
do
not
feel
at
all
dirty
by
coming
into
court
and
having
a
proper
statement
to
present
to
a
jury
that
is
tantamount
to
a
confession.
i
think
that
is
proper
evidence
as
always
been
regarded
by
all
the
courts
of
this
land
as
always
being
reliable
form
of
evidence
which
is
good
evidence
to
present
by
way
of
a
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
it
is
not.
it’s
further
removed
than
it
is
a
confession
or
an
admission
of
guilt
it’s
the
evidence
we’re
trying
to
preserve
is
that
of
an
independent
witness
and
mr.
mogill
here
says
that
you
should
not
draw
any
distinction
between
an
independent
witness
and
a
direct
statement
from
the
accused.
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
see
the
distinction
just
on
its
face.
the
fact
that
this
witness
and
also
all
the
reasons
i
enunciated
it
in
my
argument
in
chief,
could’ve
come
forward,
might
have
been
discovered.
he’s
a
human
being
of
all
the
interaction
of
his
characteristics.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
it
would
all
depend
on,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white,
this
court’s
ruling
on
the
question
of
how
miranda
is
going
to
be
continued.
if
the
court
continues
that
particular
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
i
was
starting
to
say
that
as
long
as
that
provision
of
the
miranda
case
which
is
now
something
that
guides
the
performance
of
police
still
in
force
namely,
when
he
says,
he
does
not
want
to
be
interrogated.
he
wishes
to
exercise
his
rights
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
and
mr.
justice
white,
i’m
saying
that
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
i’m
saying
that
the
police
do
not
do
that
now
and
they
would
not
do
that
as
long
as
that
particular
provision
of
the
miranda
majority
is
still
in
force,
namely,
that
when
he
says,
“i
don’t
want
to
talk,”
the
police
are
instructed
to
stop
their
interrogation
at
that
point
and
allow
him
to
exercise
his
right.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
the
point
i
was
making.
i
think,
if
he
supposes
that
they’re
going
to
deliberately
violate
the
warnings
that
are
required
to
be
given
and
so
forth
in
the
hopes
of
finding
independent
evidence.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
that’s
right.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
mr.
justice
but
in
fact
they
do
stop
and
they
do
obey
in
great
majority
of
the
time
as
many
times
as
we
have
an
influence
on
them,
they'd
be
prescriptions
that
have
been
delineated
in
the
miranda
decision.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
the
premise
of
our
whole
second
issue
that
we
briefed
and
argue.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
as
we
indicated
also
in
our
opening
argument
that,
we
feel
that
a
totality
of
circumstances
approach
to
evaluating
the
interrogation
would
cover
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
right
and
i
think
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
well,
i
respectfully
disagree.
if
he
has
been
advised
of
his
rights
and
he’s
making
his
statements,
he
is
talking
voluntarily.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
well,
he
better
not
be
arrested,
i
would
suppose.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
[laughter]
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
brooks
patterson.
i
am
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
oakland
county
in
michigan,
representing
the
people
of
the
state
of
michigan
in
this
appeal.
before
stating
the
facts,
there
are
four
dates
that
i
would
like
to
stress
because
they
have
a
bearing
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
logically
they
are
the
date
of
the
escobedo
decision
in
june
of
1964;
secondly,
the
date
of
the
offense
in
this
particular
case,
april
19,
1966;
third,
the
date
of
the
miranda
decision,
june
13,
1966;
and
finally,
the
date
of
the
commencement
of
trial
of
the
tucker
case,
october
18,
1966.
the
facts
of
the
case:
on
april
19,
1966,
it
is
undisputed
that
marline
cory
(ph)
was
brutally
beaten
and
raped
in
her
home
in
which
she
lived
by
herself.
she
was
beaten
so
badly
that
she
was
never
able
to
remember
nor
did
she
recall
the
time
that
she
testified
and
make
any
identification
of
the
defendant
as
her
assailant.
she
was
discovered
in
her
home
by
a
co-worker
who
summoned
the
police.
this
co-worker
also
noticed
inside
her
home
a
dog
and
since
miss
cory
did
not
own
a
pet,
he
brought
this
to
the
attention
of
the
police.
the
police
followed
this
dog
to
the
residence
of
the
defendant,
thomas
wayne
tucker.
after
making
inquiries
with
the
neighbors
about
the
ownership
of
that
particular
dog,
the
police
put
out
a
broadcast
to
pick
up
the
defendant
and
later
that
day,
he
was
arrested
and
brought
to
the
police
station.
before
any
interrogation
of
the
defendant,
he
was
advised
of
his
rights
as
delineated
at
that
time
by
the
escobedo
decision.
specifically,
he
was
advised
of
his
right
to
remain
silent,
that
anything
he
said
would
be
used
against
him
at
the
court
of
law,
and
that
he
had
the
right
to
an
attorney.
it
was
not
advised,
however,
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
court
appointed
attorney,
but
that
right
was
yet
to
be
mandated
in
the
miranda
decision
two
months
hence.
during
the
interrogation
that
followed,
the
defendant
said
that
he
had
obtained
the
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
but
not
at
--
in
no
specific
words
then
and
there.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
during
the
interrogation
that
followed,
the
defendant
told
the
police
that
he
had
obtained
the
noticeable
scratches
on
his
face
from
the
flarings
of
a
goose
that
he
had
killed.
and
this
would
also
account
for
the
blood
on
his
clothing.
he
said
that
all
of
these
could
be
confirmed
by
one
robert
henderson,
who
he
was
with
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
rape
and
thereby
creating
an
alibi.
later
the
next
day,
in
an
effort
to
confirm
that
alibi,
the
police
sought
out
and
talked
to
one
robert
henderson,
who
not
only
failed
to
corroborate
the
story
told
by
the
defendant
tucker,
but
actually
gave
testimony
or
a
statement
that
refuted
tucker’s
claim.
henderson
indicated
to
the
police
that
indeed
he
did
have
a
conversation
with
the
defendant
on
april
19,
1966
and
that
he
had
asked
the
defendant
how
it
came
that
he
had
these
scratches
on
his
face
and
whether
he
had
gotten
hold
of
a
wild
one
or
something,
to
which
the
defendant
tucker
replied
something
like
that,
and
then
moments
later
added,
“she
was
the
widowed
woman
in
her
thirties
who
lived
the
next
block
over.”
the
case
went
to
trial
several
months
later
on
october
18,
1966.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
this
was
a
sheriff’s
department
case
in
pontiac
township,
just
outside
the
city
of
pontiac.
on
october
18th,
it
went
to
trial
and
because
of
the
intervening
decision
of
miranda,
none
of
the
statements
made
by
defendant
tucker
were
introduced
into
evidence.
however,
henderson
was
called
as
a
prosecution
witness
and
did
testify.
the
defendant
was
convicted
by
a
jury
trial
and
sentenced
to
a
prison
term
of
20-40
years
in
view
of
his
record.
both
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
affirmed
that
conviction
with
unanimous
opinions.
upon
application
by
the
defendant
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
petition
was
granted
under
the
theory
that
henderson’s
testimony
had
been
improperly
admitted
into
evidence
by
the
trial
court
because
of
the
trial
court's
failure
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
opinion
and
we
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
by
this
court
on
december
3,
1973.
we
raise
three
issues
this
morning
in
our
argument
and
first
is
the
question
of
the
retroactivity
of
miranda.
one
week
after
the
miranda
case
was
decided,
this
court
held
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey
that
miranda
would
be
applicable
to
all
those
trials
that
commenced
after
the
decision
date
in
miranda.
i
think
you
can
see
from
that
dates
that
i
had
set
out
when
i
first
commenced,
that
we
were
caught
in
a
limbo
situation.
we
had
an
interrogation
under
escobedo
on
april
19.
miranda
came
down
in
june
and
we
commenced
trial
in
october
and
even
though
johnson
said
for
the
proposition
that
miranda
would
be
prospective
in
its
application,
we
were
experiencing
retroactive
effect
because
we
were
caught
in
this
limbo.
and
this
is
the
particular
injustice
in
this
case
that
we
complain
about
this
morning,
that
at
the
time
the
police
were
interrogating
the
defendant,
tucker,
he
was
properly
advised
of
his
escobedo
rights
and
the
police
at
that
time
were
doing
nothing
wrong.
and
now
by
operation
of
the
johnson
case
and
its
retroactive
effect,
we
are
being
told
that
the
interrogation
is
illegal.
we
feel
that
the
court
should
modify
this
retroactive
application
of
johnson
because
it
places
the
--
this
court
in
the
position,
and
the
local
court
in
the
position
of
saying
that,
tucker’s
interrogation
was
improper,
but
it
only
became
improper
by
operation
of
an
ex
post
facto
type
situation.
we
feel
that
to
make
johnson
or
the
effect
of
johnson
to
conform
to
its
rationale
and
make
it
prospective
would
be
in
order.
the
court
had
done
this
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
we
do
not
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
takes
me
immediately
to
the
second
issue
which
i
think
is
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
it
should
be
and
as
such
overruled
because
i
think
the
court
had
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
when
i
said
overrule,
i
should
have
use
a
activity
date
as
opposed
to
a
trial
date.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
i
wouldn’t
believe
that
many,
your
honor.
the
second
issue
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
your
honor,
i
personally
do
not.
i’ve
been
involved
with
prosecution
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
that
is
right.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
that’s
correct.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
i
would
hope
so.
your
honor,
the
second
issue
is
the
doctrine
that
you
just
mentioned
would
be
the
application
of
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine.
and
more
specifically,
we
raise
the
question,
whether
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
should
be
applied
to
the
testimony
on
the
identity
of
a
witness,
who
was
discovered
during
what
is
now
declared
to
be
an
improper
interrogation.
the
solicitor
general
has
intervened
on
this
particular
issue
and
will
be
arguing
as
well
on
this
point.
so,
i’d
like
to
highlight
some
of
the
more
salient
points
of
our
brief.
this
precise
question
of
witness
testimony
being
suppressed
under
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
as
yet
to
be
presented
to
this
court
and
i
take
that
lead
from
the
footnote
in
harrison
versus
united
states,
392
us
in
footnote
9.
it
would
be,
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
to
a
witness
who
testifies,
i
think
it
would
be
unwarranted
extension
of
that
particular
doctrine.
it
would
be
unwarranted
because
the
immediate
distinction
is
that
in
this
type
of
situation
with
henderson,
we
have
the
testimony
of
a
live
witness.
and
i
do
not
feel
that
we
should
automatically
equate
a
live
witness
and
all
of
that
and
suggest
the
fact
that
he
has
own,
a
memory,
and
his
own
perception
and
his
own
will
and
his
own
intellect
which
are
all
going
to
interact
down
there
when
personally
he
takes
his
stand.
we
should
not
equate
that
type
of
a
human
being
with
physical
evidence
automatically
because
we
have
at
least
that
distinguishing
characteristics
which
makes
a
human
being
unique.
arguably
is
the
fact
that
this
witness
when
he
comes
into
court
and
takes
the
stand,
he’s
going
to
be
subject
to
the
rigors
of
cross
examination
by
defense
counsel.
he
is
subject
to
impeachment
and
all
the
other
devices
that
defense
counsel
has
to
cross
examine
and
that
this
was
done
in
the
case
of
henderson
when
he
took
the
stand
before
the
jury.
and
that
he
--
a
witness
has
the
ability
to
have
come
forward
on
his
own
possibly
as
contrary
to
physical
evidence,
but
i
think
more
importantly
is
the
fact
that
when
henderson’s
name
was
brought
up
by
the
defendant
tucker,
at
that
point,
the
name
henderson
was
at
no
evidentiary
value
as
such.
it
is
not
evidence
the
mere
mentioning
of
a
name.
it
is
not
evidence
per
se.
by
the
independent
labors
of
the
police
who
sought
him
out
and
talked
to
him,
at
that
point,
he
begins
to
become
significance
and
when
he
comes
in
the
court
and
testifies,
he
then
becomes
evidence.
and
i
believe
this
court,
addressed
this
particular
problem
in
a
case
one
week
after
miranda
which
would
be
june
20,
1966
in
schmerber.
in
the
case
--
in
the
language
in
schmerber
said
that,
“the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
abide
to
compelling
one
to
be
a
witness
to
give
testimony,”
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
but
it
is
not
a
bar
against
that
compulsion
which
makes
the
witness
or
the
defendant
or
the
accused
the
source
of
real
or
physical
evidence.
and
in
this
case,
tucker
was
the
source
we
admit
of
henderson’s
identity,
but
it
is
not
evidence
the
mere
mentioning
of
that
name.
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
rather
than
being
extended
should
be
curtailed
and
i
think
is
being
curtailed
in
decisions
by
this
court.
and
i
would
say
to
court,
couple
of
the
prime
examples
would
be
the
case
of
harris
versus
new
york
in
1970
when
the
court
permitted
the
prosecution
to
use
for
impeachment
at
the
prior
statement
of
the
defendant
which
it
was
not
being
permitted
to
use
in
itscase,
case
in
chief.
even
though,
i
think
there
would
be
the
illegal
fruit,
it
was
still
being
--
the
prosecutor
was
is
being
allowed
some
use
of
it.
in
u.s
versus
calandra
evidence
which
was
illegally
obtained
during
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
was
still
being
permitted
to
be
brought
before
a
grand
jury
for
the
use
of
that
grand
jury
in
its
investigation.
the
court
--
this
court
has
developed
as
well
as
some
of
the
lower
federal
district
courts,
i
think
theories
which
are
now
doctrines
of
law
which
permit
or
avoid
the
harsh
application
of
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine;
such
theories
as
attenuation
or
the
independent
source.
these
rules
are
being
carved
out
judicially
from
the
announced
doctrine
in
order
to
avoid
the
extreme
and
i
think
harsh
application
of
the
automatic
exclusion
of
evidence
by
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine.
but
in
the
case
that
we
have,
in
the
case
of
michigan
versus
tucker,
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
and
the
purpose
of
that
application
of
that
doctrine
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct.
in
this
particular
instance,
it
would
be
itself
unreasonable
and
unfair
because
the
police
first
of
all
would
not
have
engaged
in
any
misconduct.
the
interrogation
of
tucker
met
the
standards
then
in
force
under
escobedo.
and
secondly,
when
they
went
out
to
talk
to
henderson,
this
witness,
they
were
following
what
was
the
alibi
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
had
given
a
exculpatory
remark
and
the
police
went
out
to
check
that
alibi.
and
how
they
checked
out,
it
would
have
been
a
good
probable
belief
that
tucker
would
have
released
had
his
alibi
been
confirmed
and
if
the
police
had
ignored
that
exculpatory
remark,
they
would
have
been
developed
that
responsibility.
the
final
issue
that
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
was
the
question
of
miranda
itself
and
we
pose
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
absolutely,
your
honor
and
it
would
be
very
unfair
and
obviously
unethical
thing
for
the
prosecution
or
the
police
to
have
even
consider
to
hide
the
witness
which
would
have
been
a
benefit
to
the
defendant.
and
this
is
again,
we
are
now
telling
them,
you’ve
done
something
improper
when
actually
what
they
were
doing
was
being
proper
and
very
ethical.
the
question
we
raised
with
regard
to
miranda,
was
whether
the
standards
which
were
enunciated
in
miranda,
whether
they
are
too
restrictive
and
they
are
exclusion
of
admissions
and
whether
they
are
mandated
by
the
us
constitution.
although,
majority
writing
in
miranda
i
think
answer
the
second
half
of
that
question,
when
they
said
that
we
do
not
consider
or
we
cannot
say
that
the
constitution
necessarily
requires
adherence
to
any
particular
solution
for
the
inherent
compulsion
of
the
interrogation
process.
and
those
words,
i
think
they
admitted
that
the
constitution
did
not
require
the
standards
that
they
developed,
but
this
was
a
judicially
developed
framework
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
other
half
of
the
question
are
the
standards
set
forth
in
miranda
too
restrictive
and
i
think
at
this
point
it's
undebatable
that
the
standards
which
were
enunciated
in
miranda
tolerate
no
deviance
and
the
way
the
phrases
were
couched,
they
were
couched
with
the
use
of
the
word
“must.”
these
warnings
must
be
given,
waivers
must
be
obtained
and
if
there
is
any
indication
he
does
not
want
proceed,
you
must
end
your
interrogation.
so,
what
the
court
did
in
this
instance
whereas
to
develop
an
absolute
and
flexible
and
rigid
test
and
the
court
took
what
used
to
be
a
circumstances
the
court
would
look
to,
the
advising
of
certain
constitutional
rights,
it
elevated
these
in
the
form
of
standards
what
are
now
almost
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
the
violation
of
which
results
in
the
automatic
exclusion
of
a
statement
made
by
the
defendant
regardless
of
that
statement
might
in
fact
be
voluntary.
the
supreme
court
way
back
in
1883
in
hopp
versus
utah
i
think
it
said
that
the
dealing
with
the
question
of
confessions
that
we
have
wisely
fore
born
to
mark
with
absolute
precision
the
limits
of
admission
and
exclusion,
and
i
think
they
fore
saw
the
problem
when
you
do
mark
with
a
rigid
test
what
is
going
to
be
admissible
and
what
isn’t.
what
now
happens
in
the
trial
court
and
i’m
sure
this
court
is
aware
of
it,
the
focus
is
shifted
from
the
will
of
the
accused
or
what
is
on
his
mind
or
why
he
made
a
statement
and
the
first
focus
is
now
on
to
the
conduct
of
the
police
officer
and
we’d
look
to
see
what
he
did
or
how
he
acted
in
order
to
determine
if
this
man
made
a
voluntary
statement.
well,
actually
the
test
that
police
officer
goes
through,
the
advisement
of
those
four
rights
in
the
obtaining
of
a
waiver
is
not
really
bearing
upon
the
question,
is
this
a
voluntary
confession
and
the
police
officers
scrutiny,
if
he
makes
one
fatal
mistake
in
the
advising
of
the
rights
and
later
when
he
testifies
in
court,
at
the
trial
court
in
a
hearing
like
jackson
v.
denno,
we
call
walker
hearing.
if
he
testifies
in
his
hearing
about
voluntariness
and
makes
one
mistake
and
how
he
said
he
gave
his
rights,
the
court
stops,
at
that
point,
it
is
inquiry
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
and
because
the
miranda
standards
had
been
violated,
maybe
one
had
been
omitted
or
had
been
incorrectly
testified
to,
the
inquiry
stops
and
because
of
that
deviation
from
the
standard
set
forth,
the
court,
trial
court
will
exclude
any
statement
made
by
the
accused.
the
test
is
no
longer
now.
and
miranda,
i
believe
was
supposed
to
take
us
away
from
looking
at
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
we
are
supposed
to
look
into
this
condition
precedent
before
we
get
to
the
confession.
there
is
now
a
condition
preceding
namely
the
four
rights
the
officer
makes
and
miranda
was
supposed
to
take
us
away
from
examining
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
make
a
very
simple
to
determine
if
indeed
a
voluntary
statement
was
made.
and
the
old
test
of
looking
to
the
defendant
to
see
if
his
will
was
over
borne
or
if
there
was
any
inducement
or
coercion
upon
him
or
any
threats
to
make
him,
make
a
statement
or
obtain
a
weaver,
were
supposed
to
have
been
taken
out
of
the
examination
of
voluntariness.
but
in
fact,
i
think
that
they
we’re
fooling
ourselves
if
we
don’t
realize
that
we
are
still
in
the
trial
court
and
very
much
immersed
in
a
total
circumstances
examination,
a
totality
of
circumstances.
we
still
look
to
all
these
factors
and
in
determining
whether
the
rights
were
properly
administered.
we
still,
the
court
will
still
look
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
to
see
how
the
rights
were
administered.
were
they
administered
after
three
days
of
incommunicado
interrogation
or
were
they
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
the
warnings,
yes.
and
so,
even
though
the
warnings
are
there
and
a
condition
preceding
to
get
into
the
level
of
examining
the
voluntaries,
the
court
still
brings
in
all
these
circumstance
of
how
that
officer
gave
his
rights,
when
did
he
give
the
defendant
his
rights,
under
what
circumstances
were
the
rights
administered
and
was
he
intoxicated
and
so
forth.
i
think
mr.
justice
white
in
his
dissent
foresaw
some
of
these
problems
when
he
wrote,
“today’s
decision
leaves
open
such
questions
as
whether
the
accused
was
in
custody,
whether
his
statements
were
spontaneous
or
the
product
of
interrogation,
whether
the
accused
has
effectively
waived
his
rights
and
whether
non-testimony
of
the
evidence
introduced
at
trail
is
the
fruit
of
statements
made
during
a
prohibited
interrogation”
and
mr.
justice
white
was
absolutely
correct.
we
now
have
these
mini
trials
and
the
prosecution
must
prevail
in
everyone
of
this
questions
and
more
and
should
we
feel
on
just
one
of
these
questions,
even
though
we
might
prevail
on
six,
if
we
miss
on
one
of
these
mini
trials,
at
that
point
the
inquiry
ends
and
the
judge
automatically
excludes
the
statement
that
was
obtained
as
a
fruit
or
as
a
illegal
confession.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
i
can
give
a
case,
a
specific
case
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
your
honor,
but
you
wouldn’t
see
if
the
court
has
overruled
that
way
and
i’m
sure
they
have.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
oh
yes,
i
am
surely
they
have
in
some
instances
when
the
court
has
found
it
involuntary
not
because
the
rights
were
violated
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
your
honor,
i
would
cite
this
case
as
an
example
when
at
that
point
in
time
in
1966,
all
the
rights
have
been
incumbent
upon
the
police
to
be
administered
were
given
and
now
we
find
that
the
statement
in
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
oh,
yes
and
the
statement
that
the
tucker
made
was
never
used,
any
his
remarks
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
that’s
correct.
the
rights,
the
warnings
that
had
to
be
properly
administered
were
not
technically
given
and
therefore
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
that
part
is
not.
the
totality
of
circumstances,
the
examination
of
all
the
factors
surrounding
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
a
manageable
test
and
it
is
still
being
used
again,
the
totality
to
examine
how
the
warnings
were
given.
and
this
court
has
reaffirmed
the
viability
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
as
recently
as
the
bustemonte
case
where
totality
of
circumstances
were
examined
to
determine
if
proper
consent
had
been
obtained
in
order
to
make
a
search.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
it
did.
but
i
am
going
out
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
as
being
the
test
that
the
court
found
it
a
manageable
and
a
workable
test
to
examine
the
circumstances
under
which
the
defendant
then
gave
his
consent.
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
barker
v.
wingo
and
again
this
court,
use
the
totality
of
circumstances
rather
than
a
fixed
rule
to
determine
whether
the
defendant
had
been
denied
his
right
of
a
speedy
trial.
i
suggest
that
we
adopt
and
we
move
forward
to
a
flexible
standard
of
looking
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
use
the
miranda
warnings
as
criteria
in
determining
whether
the
defendant
had
been
properly
advised
and
whether
they
had
given
proper
consent
to
waive
his
rights
to
remain
silent.
and
that
--
i
adopt
the
language
out
of
the
omnibus
crime
and
control
and
safe
streets
act
where
they
say,
“that
the
absence
of
anyone
of
these
particular
warnings
should
not
be
this
sole
determining
factor
on
the
admissibility
of
that
confession
but
ought
to
be
a
factor
that
the
judge
takes
into
consideration
in
determining
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.”
what
is
wrong
with
the
warnings
as
they
are
required
today
is
what
we
find
wrong
in
the
tucker
situation.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
that
marline
cory
was
raped
and
there’s
no
question
that
the
defendant
found,
the
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
that
offense.
and
there’s
no
question
that
the
police
were
engaged
at
that
time
in
a
proper
pre-miranda
situation
having
advised
him
of
his
rights
under
escobedo.
and
there’s
no
question
that
the
police
were
doing
something
very
proper
in
going
out,
checking
out
his
alibi
which
might
well,
have
exculpated
him.
but
there
is
a
question
that
if
the
warnings
which
are
now
required
in
the
rigid
test
that
there
are
in
the
miranda
doctrine,
if
they
are
continued
to
be
enforced
in
the
form
that
they
are
as
the
sole
criteria
in
determining
admissibility,
there
is
going
to
be
a
question
that
marline
cory
and
the
people
in
the
state
of
michigan
could
have
their
day
in
court.
but,
the
bigger
question
is
that
in
the
other
cases
that
come
after
this
one
whether
defendants
who
are
only
tied
to
their
case
by
an
admission
can
ever
be
brought
to
justice.
thank
you.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
time
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
that’s
right
your
honor.
if
given
the
court,
i
think
several
arguments
anyone
of
which
would
allow
tucker
case
to
be,
the
conviction
which
would
be
affirmed
and
we
felt
that
the
miranda
issue
did
have
a
bearing
because
that’s
up
to
the
second
issue
itself
and
that’s
how
we
got
into
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
because
of
a
violation
of
warnings
on
the
miranda
doctrine.
thank
you.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’ll
say
two
points
raised
by
counsels
for
the
respondent
as
they
raise
in
seriatim.
the
first
one
that
mr.
mogill
mentioned
to
the
court
was
a
stipulation
that
appears
in
the
brown
appendix
on
page
29,
where
in
his
formation
of
the
question,
he
said
that
what
we
stipulated
right
there,
there
was
no
independent
source.
and
since
there
could
be
no
independent
source,
that
is
not
our
stipulation.
our
stipulation
was,
i
think
as
one
of
the
justices
indicated
was
that
we
admit
that
we
learned
of
henderson
only
through
tucker
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
could
not
have
come
forward
or
would
not
have
come
forward
on
his
own
because
if
he’s
now,
as
your
particular
facts
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
at
that
particular
time,
that’s
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
next
point
raised
by
mr.
mogill
was
that
the
granting
or
failure
to
apply
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
to
witness'
testimony
would
undermine
the
deterrent
purpose
of
that
particular
rule.
and
i
think
there’s
a
presumption
here
that
the
police
are
therefore
going
to
go
out
and
violate
miranda
in
the
hopes
of
finding
evidence
of
a
third
independent
witness
type
and
then
use
him.
that’s
not
a
very
good
assumption
to
make
that
police
are
going
to
deliberately
violate
the
miranda
doctrine
in
the
hopes
of
finding
a
third
witness
which
the
rule
doesn’t
apply
to.
obviously
that
the
police
are
going
to
try
in
all
the
interrogations
to
say
within
the
guidelines
as
the
police
did
in
this
particular
case
of
interrogating
tucker
in
april.
the
--
mr.
mogill
also
indicated
that
the
miranda
has
not
been
harmful
as
did
mr.
gribbs.
it
has
had
not
any
harmful
effect.
he
said
there
was
no
evidence
as
such.
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
that
here’s
a
case
before
you
where
we
have,
i
think,
a
detriment
to
certainly
the
interest
of
justice,
sort
of
ms
cory
is
concerned
and
the
interest
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
michigan
because
we’re
here.
the
amicus
brief
that
was
filed
with
us
by
the
international
association
of
chiefs
of
police
on
page
18
and
19,
and
20
and
21,
set
forth
nine
or
ten
cases
where
the
miranda,
technical
violation
in
how
the
rights
were
administered
resulted
in
a
confession
being
suppressed
in
the
case
either
being
dismissed
or
sent
back
for
re-trial,
many
instances
tantamount
to
dismissal.
mr.
gribbs
in
his
argument
said
that
these
studies
show
that
there
has
been
no
depreciable
effect
on
law
enforcement
and
he
cites
the
pittsburgh
study
and
in
pittsburgh,
in
that
particular
study,
they
called
the
remark
that
tucker
gave,
an
exculpatory
statement,
they
didn’t
include
that.
they
said,
“well,
we
won't
consider
that
a
statement
or
admission
or
confession
purposes
of
this
survey.”
so
that,
that
report
really
is
inapplicable
to
the
situations
of
this
case.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
your
honor,
i
have
no
intention
of
ever
violating
or
whatever
foreclose
to
come
before
this
court
and
suggest
that
we
would
want
to
compel
somebody
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
trial.
i
do
not
see
that
that
is
a
situation
in
this
particular
instance.
i
safeguard
the
constitution
and
the
board
of
rights
as
much
any
lawyer
or
any
member
of
the
bar.
but
i
do
not
feel
at
all
dirty
by
coming
into
court
and
having
a
proper
statement
to
present
to
a
jury
that
is
tantamount
to
a
confession.
i
think
that
is
proper
evidence
as
always
been
regarded
by
all
the
courts
of
this
land
as
always
being
reliable
form
of
evidence
which
is
good
evidence
to
present
by
way
of
a
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
it
is
not.
it’s
further
removed
than
it
is
a
confession
or
an
admission
of
guilt
it’s
the
evidence
we’re
trying
to
preserve
is
that
of
an
independent
witness
and
mr.
mogill
here
says
that
you
should
not
draw
any
distinction
between
an
independent
witness
and
a
direct
statement
from
the
accused.
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
see
the
distinction
just
on
its
face.
the
fact
that
this
witness
and
also
all
the
reasons
i
enunciated
it
in
my
argument
in
chief,
could’ve
come
forward,
might
have
been
discovered.
he’s
a
human
being
of
all
the
interaction
of
his
characteristics.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
it
would
all
depend
on,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white,
this
court’s
ruling
on
the
question
of
how
miranda
is
going
to
be
continued.
if
the
court
continues
that
particular
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
i
was
starting
to
say
that
as
long
as
that
provision
of
the
miranda
case
which
is
now
something
that
guides
the
performance
of
police
still
in
force
namely,
when
he
says,
he
does
not
want
to
be
interrogated.
he
wishes
to
exercise
his
rights
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
and
mr.
justice
white,
i’m
saying
that
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
i’m
saying
that
the
police
do
not
do
that
now
and
they
would
not
do
that
as
long
as
that
particular
provision
of
the
miranda
majority
is
still
in
force,
namely,
that
when
he
says,
“i
don’t
want
to
talk,”
the
police
are
instructed
to
stop
their
interrogation
at
that
point
and
allow
him
to
exercise
his
right.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
the
point
i
was
making.
i
think,
if
he
supposes
that
they’re
going
to
deliberately
violate
the
warnings
that
are
required
to
be
given
and
so
forth
in
the
hopes
of
finding
independent
evidence.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
that’s
right.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
yes,
mr.
justice
but
in
fact
they
do
stop
and
they
do
obey
in
great
majority
of
the
time
as
many
times
as
we
have
an
influence
on
them,
they'd
be
prescriptions
that
have
been
delineated
in
the
miranda
decision.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
the
premise
of
our
whole
second
issue
that
we
briefed
and
argue.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
as
we
indicated
also
in
our
opening
argument
that,
we
feel
that
a
totality
of
circumstances
approach
to
evaluating
the
interrogation
would
cover
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
right
and
i
think
--
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
well,
i
respectfully
disagree.
if
he
has
been
advised
of
his
rights
and
he’s
making
his
statements,
he
is
talking
voluntarily.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
well,
he
better
not
be
arrested,
i
would
suppose.
mr.
l.
brooks
patterson
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
[laughter]
