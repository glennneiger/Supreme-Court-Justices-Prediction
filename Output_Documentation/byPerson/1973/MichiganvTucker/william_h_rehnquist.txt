justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
get
to
that
mr.
patterson,
you
--
really
your
first
one
is
that
johnson
versus
new
jersey
be
overruled,
isn’t
it?
because
it
itself
dealt
with
the
retroactivity
of
miranda
and
to
say
that
the
decision
dealing
with
retroactivity
should
be
accorded
on
a
prospective
effect.
it
is
really
kind
of
building
a
new
dimension
onto
the
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
phrase
is
a
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
to
in
the
constitution,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
if
the
guy
hadn’t
said
anything,
you
still
might
have
seen
the
gun
under
the
dresser?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
the
question
were
made
to
turn
solely
on
the
reliability
of
the
type
of
evidence
you
can
make
a
pretty
good
argument
that
physical
or
demands
to
that
evidence
tends
to
be
more
reliable
in
many
respects
than
eyewitness
evidence
or
at
least
testimonial
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
are
addressing
yourself
and
i
do
not
think
perhaps
you
are,
but
you
at
least
comment
and
said
yes,
if
we
are
talking
about
how
reliable
is
the
evidence
being
excluded,
i
should
think
a
case
could
be
made
for
the
fact
that
the
gun
on
which
fingerprints
were
might
be
a
good
deal
more
reliable
than
a
witness
who
recalls
a
particular
encounter
with
the
defendant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
should
you
got
a
plain
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
the
man
being
compelled
to
testify
against
himself.
now,
that
isn’t
the
case
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
not
of
the
compulsory
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
define
a
holding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
against
self-incrimination,
the
same
way
a
defendant
can?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
reason
bu
--
the
reason
for
which
both
the
defendant
and
the
witness
have
a
privilege
is
the
same,
it's
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
in
either
case
it
is
based
on
a
notion
of
self-incrimination.
typically
a
witness
want
to
incriminate
himself
by
testifying
the
way
a
defendant
would?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals
here
isn’t
some
harm
to
law
enforcement
suppressing
this
particular
evidence
and
not
just
going
back
to
a
new
trial
situation,
but
in
fact
letting
this
guy
go
scoot
free?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
doesn’t
represent
any
harm
to
law
enforcement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
you’re
not
necessarily
arguing
for
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
to
say
that
the
police
had
no
independent
source?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
from
the
point
of
view,
the
police
has
own
interest.
i
suppose
if
they
did
what
justice
white
is
suggesting
to
you
they
would
do,
they
give
up
all
chance
of
using
a
confession
that
the
man
might
make?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
respondent
who
was
a
defendant
arrested
and
indicted
for
rape
was
interrogated
prior
to
this
court's
decision
miranda
versus
arizona
by
police
officers
who
advised
him
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
his
right
to
counsel,
but
did
not
advise
him
of
his
right
to
appointed
counsel.
respondent
told
the
police
that
he
understood
his
right
and
that
he
did
not
desire
a
lawyer.
in
response
to
questioning
he
then
offered
the
name
of
one
henderson
as
an
alibi
witness.
the
police
contacted
henderson
who
did
not
provide
respondent
with
an
alibi,
but
indeed
quite
the
contrary
gave
the
police
incriminating
information
about
him.
respondent
saw
just
depressed
both
his
own
statements
and
henderson's
testimony
at
his
trial
which
occurred
after
the
miranda
decision.
the
trial
court
excluded
respondent's
statements,
but
the
motion
to
exclude
henderson's
testimony
was
denied
and
henderson
was
allowed
to
testify.
respondent
was
convicted
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
throughout
the
michigan
appellate
courts.
he
then
sought
habeas
corpus
relief
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
which
granted
the
writ,
holding
the
henderson's
testimony
was
inadmissible
because
his
identity
had
been
learned
only
through
respondent's
statement
given
without
the
full
scope
of
the
warning
set
forth
in
miranda
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
police
in
this
case
did
not
deny
respondent
any
right
guaranteed
by
the
constitution,
but
rather
failed
only
to
give
him
the
full
miranda
warnings.
under
these
circumstances
and
because
the
interrogation
occurred
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
miranda,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
served
by
excluding
henderson's
testimony
as
well
as
respondent's
own
statements.
there
is
no
concern
in
this
case
with
the
evidence
derived
from
respondent's
--
no
concern
that
such
evidence
is
in
anyway
untrustworthy
as
a
result
of
respondent's
failure
to
receive
full
warnings.
to
the
extent
of
the
exclusionary
rule
maybe
justified
on
the
basis
of
requiring
the
government
to
bear
a
full
burden
of
investigation,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
limited
recourse
to
respondent's
statement
which
is
involved
in
this
case
violates
any
provision
of
the
constitution.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
mr.
justice
stewart
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
a
judgment.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
