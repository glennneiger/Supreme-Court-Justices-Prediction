mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
not
here
asking
that
miranda
v.
arizona
be
overruled
nor
that
johnson
versus
new
jersey
be
overruled.
rather
the
issue
was
whether
the
holding
in
miranda
versus
arizona
should
be
extended
to
interrogation
which
elicits
statements
not
admitted
into
evidence
against
the
accused,
but
merely
lead
to
the
discovery
of
other
evidence.
the
arguments
of
the
party
is
focused
principally
on
whether
the
so-called
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
doctrine
extends
to
the
testimony
of
a
live
witness
whose
identity
was
discovered
as
a
result
of
interrogation
without
the
miranda
warnings.
the
critical
assumption
upon
which
this
argument
is
based
of
course,
is
that
there
was
in
fact
the
poison
tree,
that
it
was
clearly
a
violation
of
the
self-incrimination
clause
to
engage
in
informal
custodial
interrogation
to
obtain
statements
which
were
not
admitted
against
the
accused
at
trial
but
merely
led
to
the
discovery
of
other
evidence.
while
we
agree
with
the
state
of
michigan,
that
if
in
fact
the
tree
here
was
poisoned,
the
fruit
should
not
be
suppressed,
it
is
our
submission
that
this
case
presents
two
analytically
distinct
issues.
the
threshold
issue
involves
the
scope
of
the
protection
that
the
self-incrimination
clause
affords
to
a
subject
in
the
context
of
informal
custodial
interrogation.
in
miranda,
it
was
held
that
during
such
informal
interrogation
an
accused
may
not
be
compelled
to
make
any
statements
which
could
be
admitted
against
him
at
trial.
that
custodial
interrogation
even
without
the
use
of
tactics
which
would
render
the
statement
involuntary
was
inherently
coercive
and
that
warnings
were
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
not
violated.
we
believe
that
in
the
peculiar
context
of
informal
interrogation,
this
protection
is
adequate
to
vindicate
those
bundle
of
values
reflected
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
that
where
law
enforcement
officers
elicit
statements
during
such
custodial
interrogation
which
are
merely
used
to
discover
evidence
to
prove
which
against
self-incrimination
has
not
been
violated.
we
do
not
regard
this
claim
as
having
been
foreclosed
by
councilman
against
hitchcock,
where
it
was
held
that
a
witness
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury
could
not
be
compelled
under
a
threat
of
contempt
to
answer
questions
where
the
only
use
which
could
be
made
of
the
statements
was
to
discover
other
evidence.
first,
the
defendant
in
this
case
did
not
refuse
to
answer
any
questions.
nor
did
he
assert
his
privilege
nor
is
there
is
a
matter
of
a
fact
as
opposed
to
presumption
any
basis
for
the
assertion
that
his
statement
was
compelled
in
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
more
significantly,
in
light
of
the
values
reflected
by
the
self-incrimination
clause.
there
is
a
substantial
basis
for
distinguishing
first
between
compelled
testimony
before
grand
jury,
a
congressional
proceeding
or
similar
inquiry,
an
informal
custodial
interrogation.
and
second,
distinguishing
between
interrogation
which
leads
to
the
admission
of
statements
made
by
the
accused
at
this
trial
and
the
use
of
those
statements
to
obtain
other
evidence.
those
values
were
complete
--
the
values
reflected
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
a
clause
that
was
comprehensibly
set
forth
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
and
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission
and
the
relevant
excerpt
from
that
opinion
as
set
forth
at
page
15
of
our
brief.
unlike
grand
jury
witnesses,
the
defendant
here
was
not
subject
to
the
cruel
trilemma
of
self-accusation,
perjury
or
contempt.
moreover,
he
was
not
subject
to
inhumane
treatment
nor
given
the
circumstances
which
led
to
his
arrest
can
it
reasonably
be
said
that
his
custodial
interrogation
improperly
infringed
on
the
privacy
values
which
are
reflected
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
here
again,
such
interrogation
is
substantially
different
from
that
before
a
grand
jury
or
congressional
committee
where
a
witness
can
be
compelled
to
appear
without
the
slightest
probable
clause
to
believe
that
he
has
any
information
to
give
to
the
grand
jury.
moreover,
they
need
be
no
concern
here
that
the
interrogation
will
lead
to
the
admission
of
trial
of
self-deprecatory
statements
of
questionable
validity.
that
concern
was
important
to
the
court’s
decision.
it
was
specifically
eluded
to
twice
in
the
majority
opinion
in
miranda
and
also
in
the
discussion
of
the
purpose
of
the
miranda
warnings
which
appears
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey.
we
do
not
deny
that
such
interrogation
which
is
intended
to
obtain
leads
to
other
evidence
does
implicate
by
policies
reflected
by
the
privilege
that
is
that
the
government
and
its
context
would
be
individual
should
shoulder
the
entire
load
and
to
a
limited
extent
the
preference
for
an
accusatorial
rather
than
inquisitorial
system.
but,
we
submit
that
it
does
not
violate
those
values
anymore
than
has
already
been
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
cases
such
as
schmerber
versus
california,
united
states
versus
dionisio
and
maier
and
other
cases.
if
for
example,
an
individual
maybe
compelled
to
speak
and
when
i
use
the
word
compelled,
i
mean
under
the
threat
of
jail,
so
that
a
witness
maybe
able
to
testify
at
trial,
that
his
voice
was
that
for
example
of
a
kidnapper
who
telephoned
to
ask
for
a
ransom,
why
may
not
that
individual
if
he
is
apprehended
before
his
accomplices
have
released
the
victim
be
interrogated
without
any
such
over
compulsion
regarding
the
location
of
the
victim.
and,
if
the
victim
is
found
alive,
why
should
not
her
testimony
identifying
the
suspects
so
interrogated
not
be
admitted
or
his
fingerprints
are
found
at
the
location
where
this
victim
has
been
found,
why
should
the
be
suppressed,
yet
this
is
the
import
of
the
holding
of
a
court’s
below.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
just
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don’t
know
whether
there
has
or
has
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
i’m
merely
citing
a
hypothetical.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
would
clearly
come
within
the
import
of
a
holding
of
the
court’s
below
and
one
could
only
evoke
the
words
of
mr.
justice
marshall
in
miranda
--
in
his
miranda
dissent
when
he
suggested
that
one
is
entitled
to
feel
astonished
that
the
constitution
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i’m
sorry,
i
mean
mr.
justice
powell.[laughter]
one
is
entitled
to
feel
astonished
that
the
constitution
can
be
read
to
produce
such
a
result.
it
is
our
submission
that
as
long
as
the
interrogation
is
not
marred
by
conduct
which
would
be
found
offensive
on
due
process
grounds,
that
the
values
implicated
by
the
privilege
would
be
sufficiently
protected
by
the
exclusion
of
statements
made
by
an
individual
if
in
fact
the
miranda
warnings
are
not
given
and
that
the
statements
are
therefore
regarded
under
miranda
as
being
compelled.
the
leads
derived
from
such
statements
should
not
be
suppressed.
the
second
aspect
of
our
argument,
mr.
chief
justice
goes
to
the
fruit
of
poison
tree
doctrine
and
is
based
on
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
the
court,
the
case
of
the
coerced
confession
would
be
more
difficult
because
there
we
would
be
dealing
with
police
conduct
that
would
be
offensive
in
and
off
itself
regardless
of
what
use
is
made
of
statements.
and
there
it
could
be
reasonably
suggested
that
what
we’re
concerned
about
is
simply
deterring
this
kind
of
conduct.
that
it’s
the
conduct
which
the
police
engaged
in
them
which
is
self
offensive
and
therefore
perhaps
the
exclusionary
rules
should
be
applied
to
its
fullest
extent,
but
we
are
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
believe
that
it
was,
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
cases
to
that
effect.
although,
we
do
cite
cases
that
adhere
common
law
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
of
case
involving
this
very
issue
with
a
live
witness,
the
king
versus
lockhart
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
an
english
case
in
which
the
confession
was
obtained
which
was
excludable
on
the
traditional
voluntariness
grounds
and
the
english
courts
held
that
the
witness
could
be
permitted.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
it
is.
i
don’t
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
true.
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
framers
who
brought
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
sat
down
to
write
that
clause,
what
they
had
in
mind
was
the
law
of
england
at
the
time
as
your
honor
pointed
out.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
but
as
it
was
understood
at
common
law
again,
this
is
a
controversy
that
was
engaged
in
by
both
sides
in
miranda
case.
at
common
law
the
notion
was
that
compelled
testimony
and
the
compelled
statements
which
were
made
by
an
accused
under
compulsion,
under
torture,
under
threats
were
excluded
as
a
matter
of
common
law
evidentiary
rule
that
those
statements
were
inherently
unreliable.
and
that
when
the
privilege
was
written,
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
written,
it
was
basically
intended
to
reflect
the
british,
or
the
english
rule
that
you
could
not
be
compelled
to
appear
under
oath
and
testify
as
a
witness.
but
it
was
understood
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
that
you
could
be
subjected
to
inform
a
custodial
interrogation
and
statements
which
were
really
compelled
under
torture
were
excluded
not
because
it
was
thought
that
this
principle
was
violated,
but
because
those
statements
were
regarded
as
inherently
unreliable.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
four
minutes.
just
before,
during
the
argument,
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
asked
for
a
case
involving
a
potential
kidnapping.
there
are
several
cases
discussed
at
page
277
of
judge
friendly’s
book
“benchmarks”
in
which
he
suggests
and
cites
to
kidnapping
cases
and
other
cases
where
it
might
be
important
for
a
law
enforcement
officers
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
he
cites
a
kidnapping
case
in
which
police
attempted
to
question
in
order
to
learn
the
location
of
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
maybe
more.
also
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
about
whether
in
any
traditional
due
process
violation
fruits
would
be
excluded?
of
course
wong
sun
versus
the
united
states
was
a
case
in
which
a
confession
was
the
result
not
of
any
coercion
but
as
an
a
result
an
illegal
arrest.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
and
the
court
applied
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
to
tangible
fruits.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
of
course,
we
think
that
this
case
is
different
from
wong
sun
because
there
has
been
no
constitutional
violation.
that
is,
it
is
impossible
to
say
and
there
is
nothing
of
course
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
his
--
this
defendant
who
stepped
in
a
violation
of
any
constitutional
right.
and
that
is
why
it
leads
me
to
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make.
in
many
ways
the
argument
we
make,
although
it
somewhat
appear,
maybe
somewhat
broader
one
than
the
state
of
michigan
in
the
sense
that
our
--
the
analysis
that
we
suggest
would
apply
to
all
fruits
in
this
kind
of
a
case
without
distinction
between
tangible
evidence
and
live
witnesses.
it
would
only
apply
in
a
miranda
type
situation
and
that
it
would
not
necessarily
have
to
extend
to
where
in
fact
there
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
the
live
witness
will
based
as
it
is
on
the
notions
of
attenuation
or
notions
that
relate
to
that,
that
we
can
never
know
for
certain
that
this
witness
sort
of
not
come
forward
to
testified
but
for
the
violation
would
of
course
apply
across
the
board
to
all
cases
and
to
all
exclusionary
rules.
and
being
the
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia,
if
i
recall
correctly,
we
are
not
miranda
type
situations
but
the
fourth
amendment
violations.
there
are
several
points
that
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
as
to
why
even
if
there
is
a
--
even
if
we
are
wrong
on
our
initial
argument,
even
if
the
fifth
amendment
does
protect
against
compulsion
during
the
course
of
custodial
interrogation
relating
to
both
the
statements
and
the
fruits
why
that
exclusionary
rule
of
miranda
should
not
be
extended
to
fruits.
first,
we
know
that
most
of
the
empirical
evidence
that’s
available
and
that's
cited
in
the
briefs
for
the
respondent
indicates
that
miranda
has
very
little
effect
on
the
decision
of
a
defendant
on
whether
to
make
a
statement
or
not.
in
fact,
to
all
of
the
studies
suggest
that
it
has
had
no
effect
on
the
decision
that
is
where
the
warnings
are
given.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
know
one
which
case
is
cited
in
all
our
brief,
the
case
called
united
states
versus
castellana
which
is
now
pending
on
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
exactly
the
facts
in
united
states
versus
castellana.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
and
the
fifth
circuit
suppressed
it
as
a
fruit
of
not
having
given
the
miranda
warnings.
and
i
might
add
even
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don’t
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
still
say
that
they
are
on
the
same
level.
i
might
say
that
it
might
be
somewhat
harder
because
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
live
witness,
you
have
the
additional
element
that
you
would
never
even
know
he
might
have
come
forward
anyway.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
that’s
exactly
the
argument
we
made
to
fifth
circuit
and
they
reject
that
also
[attempt
to
laughter].
mr.
edward
r.
korman
but,
there
is
petition
for
a
rehearing
that
is
pending
now
in
the
fifth
circuit
but
they
are
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
united
states
attorney
lost
it.[laugher]
thank
you.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
not
here
asking
that
miranda
v.
arizona
be
overruled
nor
that
johnson
versus
new
jersey
be
overruled.
rather
the
issue
was
whether
the
holding
in
miranda
versus
arizona
should
be
extended
to
interrogation
which
elicits
statements
not
admitted
into
evidence
against
the
accused,
but
merely
lead
to
the
discovery
of
other
evidence.
the
arguments
of
the
party
is
focused
principally
on
whether
the
so-called
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
doctrine
extends
to
the
testimony
of
a
live
witness
whose
identity
was
discovered
as
a
result
of
interrogation
without
the
miranda
warnings.
the
critical
assumption
upon
which
this
argument
is
based
of
course,
is
that
there
was
in
fact
the
poison
tree,
that
it
was
clearly
a
violation
of
the
self-incrimination
clause
to
engage
in
informal
custodial
interrogation
to
obtain
statements
which
were
not
admitted
against
the
accused
at
trial
but
merely
led
to
the
discovery
of
other
evidence.
while
we
agree
with
the
state
of
michigan,
that
if
in
fact
the
tree
here
was
poisoned,
the
fruit
should
not
be
suppressed,
it
is
our
submission
that
this
case
presents
two
analytically
distinct
issues.
the
threshold
issue
involves
the
scope
of
the
protection
that
the
self-incrimination
clause
affords
to
a
subject
in
the
context
of
informal
custodial
interrogation.
in
miranda,
it
was
held
that
during
such
informal
interrogation
an
accused
may
not
be
compelled
to
make
any
statements
which
could
be
admitted
against
him
at
trial.
that
custodial
interrogation
even
without
the
use
of
tactics
which
would
render
the
statement
involuntary
was
inherently
coercive
and
that
warnings
were
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
not
violated.
we
believe
that
in
the
peculiar
context
of
informal
interrogation,
this
protection
is
adequate
to
vindicate
those
bundle
of
values
reflected
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
that
where
law
enforcement
officers
elicit
statements
during
such
custodial
interrogation
which
are
merely
used
to
discover
evidence
to
prove
which
against
self-incrimination
has
not
been
violated.
we
do
not
regard
this
claim
as
having
been
foreclosed
by
councilman
against
hitchcock,
where
it
was
held
that
a
witness
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury
could
not
be
compelled
under
a
threat
of
contempt
to
answer
questions
where
the
only
use
which
could
be
made
of
the
statements
was
to
discover
other
evidence.
first,
the
defendant
in
this
case
did
not
refuse
to
answer
any
questions.
nor
did
he
assert
his
privilege
nor
is
there
is
a
matter
of
a
fact
as
opposed
to
presumption
any
basis
for
the
assertion
that
his
statement
was
compelled
in
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
more
significantly,
in
light
of
the
values
reflected
by
the
self-incrimination
clause.
there
is
a
substantial
basis
for
distinguishing
first
between
compelled
testimony
before
grand
jury,
a
congressional
proceeding
or
similar
inquiry,
an
informal
custodial
interrogation.
and
second,
distinguishing
between
interrogation
which
leads
to
the
admission
of
statements
made
by
the
accused
at
this
trial
and
the
use
of
those
statements
to
obtain
other
evidence.
those
values
were
complete
--
the
values
reflected
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
a
clause
that
was
comprehensibly
set
forth
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
and
murphy
against
the
waterfront
commission
and
the
relevant
excerpt
from
that
opinion
as
set
forth
at
page
15
of
our
brief.
unlike
grand
jury
witnesses,
the
defendant
here
was
not
subject
to
the
cruel
trilemma
of
self-accusation,
perjury
or
contempt.
moreover,
he
was
not
subject
to
inhumane
treatment
nor
given
the
circumstances
which
led
to
his
arrest
can
it
reasonably
be
said
that
his
custodial
interrogation
improperly
infringed
on
the
privacy
values
which
are
reflected
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
here
again,
such
interrogation
is
substantially
different
from
that
before
a
grand
jury
or
congressional
committee
where
a
witness
can
be
compelled
to
appear
without
the
slightest
probable
clause
to
believe
that
he
has
any
information
to
give
to
the
grand
jury.
moreover,
they
need
be
no
concern
here
that
the
interrogation
will
lead
to
the
admission
of
trial
of
self-deprecatory
statements
of
questionable
validity.
that
concern
was
important
to
the
court’s
decision.
it
was
specifically
eluded
to
twice
in
the
majority
opinion
in
miranda
and
also
in
the
discussion
of
the
purpose
of
the
miranda
warnings
which
appears
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey.
we
do
not
deny
that
such
interrogation
which
is
intended
to
obtain
leads
to
other
evidence
does
implicate
by
policies
reflected
by
the
privilege
that
is
that
the
government
and
its
context
would
be
individual
should
shoulder
the
entire
load
and
to
a
limited
extent
the
preference
for
an
accusatorial
rather
than
inquisitorial
system.
but,
we
submit
that
it
does
not
violate
those
values
anymore
than
has
already
been
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
cases
such
as
schmerber
versus
california,
united
states
versus
dionisio
and
maier
and
other
cases.
if
for
example,
an
individual
maybe
compelled
to
speak
and
when
i
use
the
word
compelled,
i
mean
under
the
threat
of
jail,
so
that
a
witness
maybe
able
to
testify
at
trial,
that
his
voice
was
that
for
example
of
a
kidnapper
who
telephoned
to
ask
for
a
ransom,
why
may
not
that
individual
if
he
is
apprehended
before
his
accomplices
have
released
the
victim
be
interrogated
without
any
such
over
compulsion
regarding
the
location
of
the
victim.
and,
if
the
victim
is
found
alive,
why
should
not
her
testimony
identifying
the
suspects
so
interrogated
not
be
admitted
or
his
fingerprints
are
found
at
the
location
where
this
victim
has
been
found,
why
should
the
be
suppressed,
yet
this
is
the
import
of
the
holding
of
a
court’s
below.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
just
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don’t
know
whether
there
has
or
has
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
i’m
merely
citing
a
hypothetical.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
would
clearly
come
within
the
import
of
a
holding
of
the
court’s
below
and
one
could
only
evoke
the
words
of
mr.
justice
marshall
in
miranda
--
in
his
miranda
dissent
when
he
suggested
that
one
is
entitled
to
feel
astonished
that
the
constitution
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i’m
sorry,
i
mean
mr.
justice
powell.[laughter]
one
is
entitled
to
feel
astonished
that
the
constitution
can
be
read
to
produce
such
a
result.
it
is
our
submission
that
as
long
as
the
interrogation
is
not
marred
by
conduct
which
would
be
found
offensive
on
due
process
grounds,
that
the
values
implicated
by
the
privilege
would
be
sufficiently
protected
by
the
exclusion
of
statements
made
by
an
individual
if
in
fact
the
miranda
warnings
are
not
given
and
that
the
statements
are
therefore
regarded
under
miranda
as
being
compelled.
the
leads
derived
from
such
statements
should
not
be
suppressed.
the
second
aspect
of
our
argument,
mr.
chief
justice
goes
to
the
fruit
of
poison
tree
doctrine
and
is
based
on
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
the
court,
the
case
of
the
coerced
confession
would
be
more
difficult
because
there
we
would
be
dealing
with
police
conduct
that
would
be
offensive
in
and
off
itself
regardless
of
what
use
is
made
of
statements.
and
there
it
could
be
reasonably
suggested
that
what
we’re
concerned
about
is
simply
deterring
this
kind
of
conduct.
that
it’s
the
conduct
which
the
police
engaged
in
them
which
is
self
offensive
and
therefore
perhaps
the
exclusionary
rules
should
be
applied
to
its
fullest
extent,
but
we
are
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
believe
that
it
was,
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
cases
to
that
effect.
although,
we
do
cite
cases
that
adhere
common
law
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
of
case
involving
this
very
issue
with
a
live
witness,
the
king
versus
lockhart
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
an
english
case
in
which
the
confession
was
obtained
which
was
excludable
on
the
traditional
voluntariness
grounds
and
the
english
courts
held
that
the
witness
could
be
permitted.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
it
is.
i
don’t
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
true.
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
framers
who
brought
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
sat
down
to
write
that
clause,
what
they
had
in
mind
was
the
law
of
england
at
the
time
as
your
honor
pointed
out.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
but
as
it
was
understood
at
common
law
again,
this
is
a
controversy
that
was
engaged
in
by
both
sides
in
miranda
case.
at
common
law
the
notion
was
that
compelled
testimony
and
the
compelled
statements
which
were
made
by
an
accused
under
compulsion,
under
torture,
under
threats
were
excluded
as
a
matter
of
common
law
evidentiary
rule
that
those
statements
were
inherently
unreliable.
and
that
when
the
privilege
was
written,
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
written,
it
was
basically
intended
to
reflect
the
british,
or
the
english
rule
that
you
could
not
be
compelled
to
appear
under
oath
and
testify
as
a
witness.
but
it
was
understood
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
that
you
could
be
subjected
to
inform
a
custodial
interrogation
and
statements
which
were
really
compelled
under
torture
were
excluded
not
because
it
was
thought
that
this
principle
was
violated,
but
because
those
statements
were
regarded
as
inherently
unreliable.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
four
minutes.
just
before,
during
the
argument,
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
asked
for
a
case
involving
a
potential
kidnapping.
there
are
several
cases
discussed
at
page
277
of
judge
friendly’s
book
“benchmarks”
in
which
he
suggests
and
cites
to
kidnapping
cases
and
other
cases
where
it
might
be
important
for
a
law
enforcement
officers
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
he
cites
a
kidnapping
case
in
which
police
attempted
to
question
in
order
to
learn
the
location
of
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
maybe
more.
also
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
about
whether
in
any
traditional
due
process
violation
fruits
would
be
excluded?
of
course
wong
sun
versus
the
united
states
was
a
case
in
which
a
confession
was
the
result
not
of
any
coercion
but
as
an
a
result
an
illegal
arrest.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
and
the
court
applied
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
to
tangible
fruits.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
of
course,
we
think
that
this
case
is
different
from
wong
sun
because
there
has
been
no
constitutional
violation.
that
is,
it
is
impossible
to
say
and
there
is
nothing
of
course
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
his
--
this
defendant
who
stepped
in
a
violation
of
any
constitutional
right.
and
that
is
why
it
leads
me
to
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make.
in
many
ways
the
argument
we
make,
although
it
somewhat
appear,
maybe
somewhat
broader
one
than
the
state
of
michigan
in
the
sense
that
our
--
the
analysis
that
we
suggest
would
apply
to
all
fruits
in
this
kind
of
a
case
without
distinction
between
tangible
evidence
and
live
witnesses.
it
would
only
apply
in
a
miranda
type
situation
and
that
it
would
not
necessarily
have
to
extend
to
where
in
fact
there
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
the
live
witness
will
based
as
it
is
on
the
notions
of
attenuation
or
notions
that
relate
to
that,
that
we
can
never
know
for
certain
that
this
witness
sort
of
not
come
forward
to
testified
but
for
the
violation
would
of
course
apply
across
the
board
to
all
cases
and
to
all
exclusionary
rules.
and
being
the
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia,
if
i
recall
correctly,
we
are
not
miranda
type
situations
but
the
fourth
amendment
violations.
there
are
several
points
that
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
as
to
why
even
if
there
is
a
--
even
if
we
are
wrong
on
our
initial
argument,
even
if
the
fifth
amendment
does
protect
against
compulsion
during
the
course
of
custodial
interrogation
relating
to
both
the
statements
and
the
fruits
why
that
exclusionary
rule
of
miranda
should
not
be
extended
to
fruits.
first,
we
know
that
most
of
the
empirical
evidence
that’s
available
and
that's
cited
in
the
briefs
for
the
respondent
indicates
that
miranda
has
very
little
effect
on
the
decision
of
a
defendant
on
whether
to
make
a
statement
or
not.
in
fact,
to
all
of
the
studies
suggest
that
it
has
had
no
effect
on
the
decision
that
is
where
the
warnings
are
given.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
know
one
which
case
is
cited
in
all
our
brief,
the
case
called
united
states
versus
castellana
which
is
now
pending
on
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
exactly
the
facts
in
united
states
versus
castellana.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
and
the
fifth
circuit
suppressed
it
as
a
fruit
of
not
having
given
the
miranda
warnings.
and
i
might
add
even
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
don’t
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
still
say
that
they
are
on
the
same
level.
i
might
say
that
it
might
be
somewhat
harder
because
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
live
witness,
you
have
the
additional
element
that
you
would
never
even
know
he
might
have
come
forward
anyway.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
that’s
exactly
the
argument
we
made
to
fifth
circuit
and
they
reject
that
also
[attempt
to
laughter].
mr.
edward
r.
korman
but,
there
is
petition
for
a
rehearing
that
is
pending
now
in
the
fifth
circuit
but
they
are
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
united
states
attorney
lost
it.[laugher]
thank
you.
