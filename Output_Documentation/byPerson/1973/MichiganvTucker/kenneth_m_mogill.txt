mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
question
presented
for
the
court's
consideration
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
any
basis
in
precedent
logical
policy
for
creating
a
distinction
between
physical
and
verbal
derivative
evidence
in
refusing
to
suppress
from
using
the
state’s
case
in
chief.
the
testimony
of
a
witness
which
was
illegally
obtained,
where
it
is
--
where
the
existence
and
identity
of
that
witness
were
learned
solely
as
a
direct
result
of
illegal
police
--
of
admitted
illegal
police
conduct
and
where
it
is
stipulated
by
petitioner
that
there
is
no
independent
source
for
the
discovery
of
the
witness'
existence
and
identity.
while
this
court
has
not
previously
passed
on
this
précise
fact
situation.
the
distinction
proposed
by
petitioner
has
never
been
accepted
by
this
court
and
has
in
fact
expressly
been
rejected
in
circumstances
closely
similar
to
those
of
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
in
the
wong
sun
case
where
this
court
–
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
sole
distinction
between
this
case
and
wong
sun
is
that
the
verbal
evidence
which
was
rejected
in
wong
sun
was
that
of
the
appellant
rather
than
the
witness.
the
argument
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
not
completely,
that’s
correct.
the
sole
distinction
between
wong
sun
and
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
witness,
the
testimony
excluding
witness
in
wong
sun
was
that
of
the
appellant
rather
than
witness.
however,
petitioner
suggests,
no
circumstances
which
distinguished
wong
sun
from
the
case
at
bar
and
then
pointed
that
applying
this
court’s
traditional
deterrent's
impact
approach
to
exclusionary
rule
cases
requires
application
of
the
same
result
in
wong
sun
to
facts
of
the
case
at
bar.
and
if
i
am
might,
i
would
like
to
go
into
detail
regarding
the
circumstances,
regarding
the
proposed
test
which
you
authored
mr.
chief
justice
in
smith
and
bowden
case
and
which
i
submit
may
not
be
squared
with
the
exclusionary
principles
enunciated
by
this
court
in
wong
sun
and
previously
in
nardone
and
silverthorne.
the
proposed
distinction
would
have
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
of
a
witness
turned
not
on
the
relationship
between
the
primary
police
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
witness'
existence
and
identity
but
rather
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
witness'
decision
to
appear
in
court.
the
test
further
distinguishes
physical
from
verbal
evidence
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
no
guarantee
that
a
witness'
testimony
will
favor
the
prosecution.
that
a
witness
is
subject
to
cross
examination
and
that
physical
evidence
speaks
for
itself.
a
further
condition
which
has
been
articulated
in
this
test
is
that
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
of
the
witness
goes
to
weight
but
not
the
admissibility
of
that
test
--
of
that
evidence.
the
voluntariness
of
the
a
witness'
decision
to
testify
is
not
an
appropriate
consideration
for
the
reason
that
it
goes
not
to
the
relationship
between
the
primary
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
witness.
and
since
the
focus
that
this
court
has
consistently
applied
in
administering
the
exclusionary
rules
is
the
impact
of
deterrence.
this
focus
would
be
ignored
by
such
a
test.
moreover,
voluntariness
of
a
witness'
decision
to
testify
is
not
appropriate
consideration
because
a
witness
maybe
compelled
to
come
into
court
and
testify
by
the
subpoena
powers
of
the
court
and
if
the
witness
refuses
to
testify,
the
witness
is
subject
to
a
threat
of
contempt.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
such
a
distinction
would
have
no
bearing
on
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
because
it
is
has
no
bearing
under
relationship
between
the
primary
legality
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
my
point
was
that
the
distinction
which
is
proposed
by
petitioner
is
not
appropriate
because
the
voluntariness
of
the
witness
is
irrelevant
given
this
court
subpoena
power.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no,
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
for
a
second
that
where
a
witness
voluntarily
appears
that
the
witness
may
not
be
used.
however,
in
the
case
before
this
court
right
now,
it
is
stipulated
that
there
was
no
independence
source.
and
once
a
primary
taint
has
been
established
the
prior
case
to
this
court
could
consistently
hold
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
am
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
have
--
at
present
i
do
not
know
although
i
would
assume
that
he
was
as
matter
of
practice
in
state
courts,
subpoenas
are
sent
out
prior
to
trial.
the
point
i
am
making
is
that,
because
of
the
subpoena
power
of
the
court,
because
a
witness
maybe
made
to
appear
regardless
of
his
voluntariness
apart
from
an
independence
source
situation,
the
voluntariness
of
the
witness'
decision
is
irrelevant.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
there’s
no
basis
whatever
in
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
it
is
possible.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
it
was
stipulated
however
that
there
was
no
independence
source.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct
and
the
petitioner
has
never
alleged
that
there
was
an
independent
source
for
the
discovery
of
the
witness'
identity.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
it
fully
does
not
preclude
entirely,
but
because
of
the
primary
illegality
the
burden
necessarily
shifts
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
the
distinctions
that
had
been
urged
between
physical
and
verbal
evidence
regarding
the
nature
of
the
evidence
also
are
inappropriate
for
the
reason
that
they
ignore
the
relationship
between
the
primary
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
but,
they
are
also
inappropriate
for
the
reason
that
just
as
a
search
may
not
be
justified
on
basis
what
it
produces,
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
of
a
witness
has
never
turned
on
whose
side
it
favors.
and
the
admissibility
of
physical
evidence
does
not
turn
on
whether
or
not
it
is
in
fact
marijuana
for
example
or
oregano
or
it
is
in
fact
heroine
as
opposed
for
example
lactose.
similarly
the
argument
that
live
evidence
is
distinguishable
from
physical
evidence
on
the
grounds
that
live
evidence
is
subject
to
cross
examination.
also
does
not
hold
up
for
the
reason
that
in
the
case
of
physical
evidence
the
defense
attorney
can
and
does
cross
examine
the
expert
offering
the
testimony.
similarly,
the
claim
that
the
matter
by
which
the
witness
testimony,
the
witness
was
discovered
goes
to
the
weight
and
not
the
admissibility
of
that
witness,
testimony
is
not
an
appropriate
consideration
for
the
reason
that
the
weight
of
a
witness
testimony
is
determined
by
his
opportunity
and
capacity
for
observation.
and
on
the
basis
of
any
interest
or
bias
the
witness
may
have.
how
the
police
came
to
find
this
witness
is
irrelevant
to
that
consideration
and
in
point
of
that
a
defense
attorney
trying
a
criminal
case
would
not
be
permitted
to
ask
a
witness
how
did
the
police
find
you.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
in
certain
circumstances,
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
your
call
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
am
not
relying
on
such
a
distinction
and
in
fact
this
court’s
exclusionary
rule
cases
do
not
consider
the
reliability
of
the
evidence
as
a
factor
and
assessing
whether
or
not
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule.
i
think
that
an
appropriate
case
which
is
analogous
for
the
point
of
this
scope
exclusion
necessary
is
this
court's
decision
in
kastigar.
because
the
interest
at
stake
in
kastigar
were
the
same
as
those
involved
here
and
that
is
protection
of
the
privilege.
and
court
in
kastigar
was
considering
the
scope
of
exclusion
necessary
in
order
to
restore
the
privilege,
in
order
to
maintain
the
privilege.
the
only
difference
being
that
in
kastigar
the
view
is
perspective
in
maintaining
the
privilege
whereas
in
the
case
the
view
is
retrospective
in
terms
of
returning
the
parties
to
the
status
quo.
the
petitioner
in
kastigar
challenged
the
sufficiency
of
the
statute
under
consideration
on
the
ground
that,
that
statute
would
not
protect
against
derivative
use
of
leads
and
names
of
witnesses.
this
court
rejected
that
contention,
specifically
stating
that
not
only
would
the
statute
not
permit
derivative
use
of
leads
and
names
of
witnesses,
but
that
the
statute
could
not
permit
such
use
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
the
constitutional
command.
in
fact
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well,
in
this
case
there
is
admitted
violation
of
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
this
court's
holding
in
miranda
was
that
in
the
absence
of
all
the
warnings
required
therein
the
compulsion
inherit
in
interrogation
process
could
not
be
met,
so
that
any
statement
given
was
for
constitutional
purposes
compelled.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
a
position
to
argue
holding
versus
the
victim,
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
appropriate
because
even
if
miranda
was
not
decided
on
constitutional
grounds,
this
court
has
never
required
a
violation
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct
and
it
is
my
position
that
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
there
was
independent
source
for
the
discovery
of
the
gun.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
such
as
a
finger
print
i
would
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
or
ballistics,
that
would
still
be
a
direct
and
immediate
result
of
a
constitutional
violation
over
his
rights.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
but
this
court
since
in
nardone
has
refused
to
distinguish
between
direct
and
derivative
fruits
of
illegal
activity
and
in
fact,
the
court's
concluding
paragraph
in
the
calandra
case
expressly
reiterates
the
notion
that
direct
–-
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
similarly
in
a
prophylactic
rule.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
in
order
for
miranda
to
be
affective,
there
must
be
remove
any
incentive
to
violate
it
and
if
a
police
officers
is
able
to
use
in
court,
verbal
evidence
which
is
directly
derived
from
a
violation
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly,
the
testimony
of
the
witness.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
his
testimony
which
was
obtained
--
it
is
testimony
which
was
obtained
solely
and
directly
as
a
result
of
a
statement
elicited
from
the
defendant
in
violation
of
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
consistency
limited
the
application
of
the
fruits
doctrine
to
those
situations
where
the
deterrence
aspect
would
be
met.
and
i
believe
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there
is
not
distinction
between
physical
and
verbal
evidence
that
in
point
the
fact
an
officer
would
be
encouraged
to
violate
miranda
if
you
were
able
to
use
the
witness
such
as
was
found
here.
and
that
the
deterrent
purposes
recognized
in
wong
sun
and
in
the
prior
cases
would
require
rejection
of
the
proposed
distinction
between
a
witness
and
physical
testimony.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
on
the
basis
of
the
hypothetical
as
you
pose
it
mr.
chief
justice.
i
see
no
relationship
between
the
any
police
legality
and
the
cross
examination
of
the
witness.
and
for
that
reason
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
in
that
case
there
will
be
no
relationship.
there
will
be
no
evidentiary
gain
to
the
prosecution
from
its
misconduct
to
find
this
gender
hypothetical
correctly.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
you
have
hypothesized,
the
question
i
feel
incapable
of
giving
a
definitive
answer.
i
think
that
the
question
would
ultimately
depend
on
the
same
principles
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
there
was
independent
source
for
the
discovery
of
that
victim
then
of
course,
witness
testimony
would
be
admissible.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes,
however
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
however,
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
result
in
your
case
because
since
kidnaps
are
normally
for
the
purpose
of
ransom.
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
kidnapper
initially
to
make
the
identity
of
the
victim
known
so
that
there
is
no
direct
relationship
between
the
illegality
of
that
act
of
breaking
in
and
discovering
the
existence
identity
of
the
witness.
so
that
in
fact
the
witness
testimony
would
be
admissible.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
because
that
did
not
lead
the
police
to
the
existence
and
identity
of
the
witness.
there
are
maybe
a
partial
exclusion,
involves
such
as
is
involved
in
the
wade
and
gilbert
situation
where
if
there
is
an
independence
source
for
identifying
a
defendant
apart
from
an
illegal
lineup,
the
witness
may
still
come
in
to
court,
testify
as
the
identity
of
the
defendant
on
the
basis
of
a
previous
observation,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
the
observation
of
the
lineup.
so
that
the
witness
may
well
be
permitted
to
testify
as
a
complaining
witness,
but
perhaps
and
i
just
do
not
have
an
answer
that
right
now
as
to
the
offense
related
to
the
illegal
break
in.
the
test
which
was
--
which
is
proposed
by
petitioner,
i
submit
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated
is
inconsistent
with
the
deterrent
principles
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as
previously
fashioned
by
this
court.
but
i
believe
that
the
test
should
be
rejected
for
reasons
beyond
that
because
in
those
courts
which
have
attempted
to
apply
the
test,
it
is
proven
to
be
a
workable.
to
begin
with,
the
test
attempts
to
derive
definite
conclusions
from
the
acts
which
are
ambiguous,
qualitatively
more
so
than
many
others
which
the
law
permits,
definite
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from.
and
think,
this
is
demonstrated
in
the
experience
of
courts
which
have
attempted
to
imply
to
apply
the
smith
and
bowden
test.
none
has
articulated
any
consistence
standards
towards
application
and
in
point
of
fact
while
smith
and
bowden
and
edwards,
the
witness'
initial
reluctance
which
was
later
overcome
was
viewed
as
attenuating
factor
which
justified
admissibility
of
the
witness
testimony
in
the
taint
case
the
same
factual
context
was
viewed
is
exploitation
of
taint
requiring
suppression.
in
the
original
preceding
this
case
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
the
same
result
that
was
reached
in
smith
and
bowden
was
reached
on
the
basis
of
the
exact
opposite
reasoning.
the
court
presuming
without
any
foundation
in
the
record,
i
might
add,
that
henderson’s
testimony
was
probably
voluntary,
therefore
there
was
no
exploitation.
therefore
the
witness
testimony
should
be
admissible
and
in
smith
and
anderson,
the
witness'
initial
reluctance,
i
am
sorry
the
witness'
initial
willingness
was
viewed
as
insufficient
to
break
the
clausal
chain
--
to
taint
a
chain.
there
is
no
policy
considerations
which
permit
the
court
to
distinguish
among
these
contradictory
applications
because
of
the
fact
none
of
them
go
to
the
traditional
test
of
deterrence
which
this
court
is
applied
that
is
the
relationship
between
the
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
sought
to
be
suppressed.
and
ultimately
this
test
by
focusing
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
witness'
decision
to
testify,
would
have
the
administration
of
important
constitutional
principles
depend
on
the
emotions
of
the
witness
and
his
feelings
towards
the
defendant,
the
victim,
the
courts
and
the
police.
i
think
that
smith
and
bowden
test
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly
but
how
the
police
came
to
find
the
witness
is
not
something
which
maybe
reached
by
cross
examination,
so
that
the
statement
that
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
those
factors
go
to
the
weight
of
the
admissi
--
to
the
weight
of
evidence
but
not
to
its
inadmissibility
because
they
have
no
bearing
on
the
constitutional
principles
at
stake.
i
believe
that
the
smith
and
bowden
test
has
for
this
reasons
shown
itself
to
the
unworkable
and
that
the
principles
previously
annunciated
by
this
court
have
shown
themselves
to
be
capable
of
minimizing
the
loss
of
evidence
by
the
various
requirements
of
standing
attenuation
independent
source.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
which
the
courts
that
have
attempt
to
apply
the
test
have
found
themselves
in
is
that
they
have
not
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
distinguishing
live
physical
fruits
on
the
basis
of
voluntariness
of
the
witness'
decision
to
testify.
the
characterization
of
the
decision
to
testify
is
attenuation
or
exploitation
has
turned
on
the
individual
judges'
assessments
rather
than
on
the
facts
going
to
voluntariness
of
the
decision
to
testify
and
so,
i
think
the
test
ultimately
is
part
of
the
voluntariness
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
the
difficulties
here
have
shown
themselves
however
to
be
of
such
magnitude
that
the
test
has
been
unworkable
and
i
think
that
for
this
court
who
adopt
it
would
besides
undercutting
the
established
principles
of
exclusionary
rule,
would
--
the
court
would
adopt
a
test
which
this
court
concede
today
on
the
basis
of
the
test
or
the
cases
which
apply
the
test
is
an
unworkable
test.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
believe
that
the
–
no,
i
have
said
to
my
brief,
i
have
not
talk
about
it
here.
judge
gazelle’s
opinion
in
the
austin
case
attempted
to
apply
the
conflicting
opinions
from
the
dc
circuit
and
judge
gazelle
concluded
that
the
test
was
in
such
unusable
safe
that
to
decide
the
question
in
austin
he
had
to
return
to
the
primary
principles
of
exclusionary
rule
and
with
those
resolved
the
case
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
evidence
in
that
case
was
suppressed.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well,
in
that
situation
mr.
wong
sun
had
been
arraigned
by
a
magistrate
and
had
come
back
voluntarily
several
days
later
after
having
had
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that
goes
to
a
distinction
i
think
between
the
position
of
a
witness,
who
has
no
alternative
of
not
coming
into
court
and
testify,
and
a
person
who
has
a
potential
dependence,
such
as
wong
sun
who
after
being
arraigned
then
came
in
and
this
court
held
that
his
decision
to
testify
was
sufficiently
remote
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
a
witness
has
no
choice
not
to
testify.
once
the
police
have
obtained
and
have
come
upon
his
existence
and
identity.
the
court’s
opinion
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes,
but
i
am
distinguishing
between
the
situation
of
an
accomplice
witness
who
has
a
privilege
and
a
witness
who
is
not
an
accomplice,
who
does
not
have
the
privilege.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
but
in
situation
of
a
witness
to
a
crime
who
is
not
himself
a
suspect.
there
is
no
privilege
which
would
permit
that
witness
to
come
into
court
and
say,
“i
refuse
to
testify
just
because
i
do
not
want
to.”
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
don’t
believe
at
all
your
point.
the
second
question
which
i
wish
to
address
goes
to
the
miranda
question
and
the
question
before
this
court,
at
this
point
in
time,
is
not
whether
miranda
should
have
been
adopted
although
i
submit
that
it
was
correctly
adopted,
but
rather
given
the
existence
of
miranda
as
the
operation
of
that
decision
in
the
last
state
years
been
shown
to
be
so
harmful
to
law
enforcement
in
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
as
to
justify
departure
from
the
principles
of
stare
decisis.
the
available
evidence
indicates
that
no
harm
has
come
to
law
enforcement
as
a
result
of
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
see
no
harm
the
law
enforcement
and
requiring
the
police
to
gain
--
in
permitting
the
police
to
gain
no
evidentiary
advantage
as
a
result
with
their
own
illegality.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well,
unless
this
court
overrules
johnson,
then
this
case
must
be
due
in
the
context
of
a
miranda
violation
which
took
place
after
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
that
–
well,
i
would
urge
this
court
not
to
reconsider
johnson.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
i
mean,
i
am
not
attempting
to
evade
your
question
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
am
just
attempting
to
put
the
various
points
in
my
answer
in
an
order.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
appreciable
impact
whatever
on
the
administration
of
justice
by
reconsideration
of
johnson
at
this
point
in
time
and
for
that
reason
alone,
it
should
not
be
reconsidered.
however
in
response
to
your
question,
i
believe
that
the
centrality
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process
at
trial
sufficiently
justifies
the
decision
in
johnson
as
to
make
that
a
close
question
before
in
this
court
today.
the
miranda
decision
was
necessary
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
what
this
court
found
in
miranda,
i
submit
is
that
application
of
the
old
due
process
test
had
shown
itself
to
be
so
incapable
of
protecting
the
privilege
that
the
integrity
of
the
trial
process
was
in
jeopardy.
and
that
without
a
strict
rule
requiring
the
police
to
inform
a
suspect
of
all
of
those
rights
which
are
most
critical
at
that
time
and
reminding
the
police
of
restraints
the
law
imposes
upon
them,
that
a
trial
was
in
danger
of
becoming
that
might
appeal
from
the
interrogation
process.
these
facts
were
so
deeply
to
the
part
of
our
legal
system
that
the
decision
in
johnson,
applying
miranda
partially
retroactively
is
certainly
not
out
of
line
with
the
prior
--
with
other
decisions
of
this
court
involving
retroactivity.
today
--
the
police
today
are
familiar
with
the
miranda
decision
and
they
are
fully
incorporated
into
their
day-to-day
workings.
and
mr.
gribbs
my
co-counsel,
representing
detroit
bar
association
will
address
himself
to
that
to
a
point
in
addition
to
my
remarks.
miranda
has
had
a
beneficial
impact
on
law
enforcement
in
toto
and
that
it
provides
the
police
with
a
clear
standard
for
determining
what
their
own
limits
are
and
what
they
may
or
may
not
do.
and
it
also
has
provided
the
courts
with
an
objective
standard
against
which
to
measure
any
claims
of
waiver.
and
as
to
the
waiver
question,
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
a
question
this
morning
as
to
any
michigan
cases
on
that
point.
there’s
a
recent
case
in
michigan
court
of
appeals
case,
people
v.
mcclendon,
the
citation
which
escapes
me
but
in
that
case
the
defendant
had
been
given
the
applicable
miranda
warnings
had
refused
to
sign
a
waiver
and
had
made
a
statement,
and
the
trial
court
that
held
that
there
was
a
valid
waiver.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
--
the
conviction
and
remanded
it
for
hearing
saying
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
on
those
facts.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
i
believe
that’s
what
your
question
had
been
this
morning.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
unless
one
can
imagine
the
situation
of
a
police
officer
utilizing
a
suspect
and
at
the
same
time,
reciting
the
warnings.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
while
doing
that.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i’ve
thought
of
that.
the
decision
in
miranda
is
also
sound
constitutional
policy
or
to
be
paraphrase
from
the
escobedo
decision,
there’s
no
place
in
the
democracy
where
a
system
of
criminal
law
which
comes
to
depend
for
its
continued
effectiveness
and
citizen’s
abdication
through
unawareness
of
their
constitutional
rights.
the
objections
to
the
miranda
decision
which
are
urged
before
this
court
do
not
go
to
any
claim
that
miranda
has
caused
an
increase
of
crime
which
it
clearly
has
not.
but
rather
to
its
alleged
inflexibility.
the
modifications
which
are
urged,
however,
each
of
them
would
swallow
up
the
rule
and
effectively
overrule
the
case.
i
think
it
is
incorrect
to
state
that
failure
to
advise
an
indigent
of
his
right
to
court
appointed
counsel
is
a
mere
technicality.
nor
could
it
be
considered
a
technicality
not
to
advise
someone
of
the
right
to
silence
in
a
single
basis
for
distinguishing
among
failure
to
advise
a
person
of
anyone
of
those
rights.
inadvertence,
like
good
faith
is
irrelevant
and
i
would
submit
that
none
of
the
modifications
urged
in
miranda
would
be
capable
of
effectuating
that
decision
as
each
of
them
would
swallow
the
decision.
and
i
give
the
rest
of
my
time
to
the
detroit
bar
association,
and
mr.
gribbs
will
address
himself
to
the
experiences
of
the
police
in
applying
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
question
presented
for
the
court's
consideration
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
any
basis
in
precedent
logical
policy
for
creating
a
distinction
between
physical
and
verbal
derivative
evidence
in
refusing
to
suppress
from
using
the
state’s
case
in
chief.
the
testimony
of
a
witness
which
was
illegally
obtained,
where
it
is
--
where
the
existence
and
identity
of
that
witness
were
learned
solely
as
a
direct
result
of
illegal
police
--
of
admitted
illegal
police
conduct
and
where
it
is
stipulated
by
petitioner
that
there
is
no
independent
source
for
the
discovery
of
the
witness'
existence
and
identity.
while
this
court
has
not
previously
passed
on
this
précise
fact
situation.
the
distinction
proposed
by
petitioner
has
never
been
accepted
by
this
court
and
has
in
fact
expressly
been
rejected
in
circumstances
closely
similar
to
those
of
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
in
the
wong
sun
case
where
this
court
–
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
sole
distinction
between
this
case
and
wong
sun
is
that
the
verbal
evidence
which
was
rejected
in
wong
sun
was
that
of
the
appellant
rather
than
the
witness.
the
argument
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
not
completely,
that’s
correct.
the
sole
distinction
between
wong
sun
and
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
witness,
the
testimony
excluding
witness
in
wong
sun
was
that
of
the
appellant
rather
than
witness.
however,
petitioner
suggests,
no
circumstances
which
distinguished
wong
sun
from
the
case
at
bar
and
then
pointed
that
applying
this
court’s
traditional
deterrent's
impact
approach
to
exclusionary
rule
cases
requires
application
of
the
same
result
in
wong
sun
to
facts
of
the
case
at
bar.
and
if
i
am
might,
i
would
like
to
go
into
detail
regarding
the
circumstances,
regarding
the
proposed
test
which
you
authored
mr.
chief
justice
in
smith
and
bowden
case
and
which
i
submit
may
not
be
squared
with
the
exclusionary
principles
enunciated
by
this
court
in
wong
sun
and
previously
in
nardone
and
silverthorne.
the
proposed
distinction
would
have
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
of
a
witness
turned
not
on
the
relationship
between
the
primary
police
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
witness'
existence
and
identity
but
rather
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
witness'
decision
to
appear
in
court.
the
test
further
distinguishes
physical
from
verbal
evidence
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
no
guarantee
that
a
witness'
testimony
will
favor
the
prosecution.
that
a
witness
is
subject
to
cross
examination
and
that
physical
evidence
speaks
for
itself.
a
further
condition
which
has
been
articulated
in
this
test
is
that
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
of
the
witness
goes
to
weight
but
not
the
admissibility
of
that
test
--
of
that
evidence.
the
voluntariness
of
the
a
witness'
decision
to
testify
is
not
an
appropriate
consideration
for
the
reason
that
it
goes
not
to
the
relationship
between
the
primary
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
witness.
and
since
the
focus
that
this
court
has
consistently
applied
in
administering
the
exclusionary
rules
is
the
impact
of
deterrence.
this
focus
would
be
ignored
by
such
a
test.
moreover,
voluntariness
of
a
witness'
decision
to
testify
is
not
appropriate
consideration
because
a
witness
maybe
compelled
to
come
into
court
and
testify
by
the
subpoena
powers
of
the
court
and
if
the
witness
refuses
to
testify,
the
witness
is
subject
to
a
threat
of
contempt.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
such
a
distinction
would
have
no
bearing
on
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
because
it
is
has
no
bearing
under
relationship
between
the
primary
legality
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
my
point
was
that
the
distinction
which
is
proposed
by
petitioner
is
not
appropriate
because
the
voluntariness
of
the
witness
is
irrelevant
given
this
court
subpoena
power.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no,
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
for
a
second
that
where
a
witness
voluntarily
appears
that
the
witness
may
not
be
used.
however,
in
the
case
before
this
court
right
now,
it
is
stipulated
that
there
was
no
independence
source.
and
once
a
primary
taint
has
been
established
the
prior
case
to
this
court
could
consistently
hold
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
am
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
have
--
at
present
i
do
not
know
although
i
would
assume
that
he
was
as
matter
of
practice
in
state
courts,
subpoenas
are
sent
out
prior
to
trial.
the
point
i
am
making
is
that,
because
of
the
subpoena
power
of
the
court,
because
a
witness
maybe
made
to
appear
regardless
of
his
voluntariness
apart
from
an
independence
source
situation,
the
voluntariness
of
the
witness'
decision
is
irrelevant.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
there’s
no
basis
whatever
in
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
it
is
possible.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
it
was
stipulated
however
that
there
was
no
independence
source.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct
and
the
petitioner
has
never
alleged
that
there
was
an
independent
source
for
the
discovery
of
the
witness'
identity.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
it
fully
does
not
preclude
entirely,
but
because
of
the
primary
illegality
the
burden
necessarily
shifts
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
the
distinctions
that
had
been
urged
between
physical
and
verbal
evidence
regarding
the
nature
of
the
evidence
also
are
inappropriate
for
the
reason
that
they
ignore
the
relationship
between
the
primary
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
but,
they
are
also
inappropriate
for
the
reason
that
just
as
a
search
may
not
be
justified
on
basis
what
it
produces,
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
of
a
witness
has
never
turned
on
whose
side
it
favors.
and
the
admissibility
of
physical
evidence
does
not
turn
on
whether
or
not
it
is
in
fact
marijuana
for
example
or
oregano
or
it
is
in
fact
heroine
as
opposed
for
example
lactose.
similarly
the
argument
that
live
evidence
is
distinguishable
from
physical
evidence
on
the
grounds
that
live
evidence
is
subject
to
cross
examination.
also
does
not
hold
up
for
the
reason
that
in
the
case
of
physical
evidence
the
defense
attorney
can
and
does
cross
examine
the
expert
offering
the
testimony.
similarly,
the
claim
that
the
matter
by
which
the
witness
testimony,
the
witness
was
discovered
goes
to
the
weight
and
not
the
admissibility
of
that
witness,
testimony
is
not
an
appropriate
consideration
for
the
reason
that
the
weight
of
a
witness
testimony
is
determined
by
his
opportunity
and
capacity
for
observation.
and
on
the
basis
of
any
interest
or
bias
the
witness
may
have.
how
the
police
came
to
find
this
witness
is
irrelevant
to
that
consideration
and
in
point
of
that
a
defense
attorney
trying
a
criminal
case
would
not
be
permitted
to
ask
a
witness
how
did
the
police
find
you.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
in
certain
circumstances,
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
your
call
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
am
not
relying
on
such
a
distinction
and
in
fact
this
court’s
exclusionary
rule
cases
do
not
consider
the
reliability
of
the
evidence
as
a
factor
and
assessing
whether
or
not
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule.
i
think
that
an
appropriate
case
which
is
analogous
for
the
point
of
this
scope
exclusion
necessary
is
this
court's
decision
in
kastigar.
because
the
interest
at
stake
in
kastigar
were
the
same
as
those
involved
here
and
that
is
protection
of
the
privilege.
and
court
in
kastigar
was
considering
the
scope
of
exclusion
necessary
in
order
to
restore
the
privilege,
in
order
to
maintain
the
privilege.
the
only
difference
being
that
in
kastigar
the
view
is
perspective
in
maintaining
the
privilege
whereas
in
the
case
the
view
is
retrospective
in
terms
of
returning
the
parties
to
the
status
quo.
the
petitioner
in
kastigar
challenged
the
sufficiency
of
the
statute
under
consideration
on
the
ground
that,
that
statute
would
not
protect
against
derivative
use
of
leads
and
names
of
witnesses.
this
court
rejected
that
contention,
specifically
stating
that
not
only
would
the
statute
not
permit
derivative
use
of
leads
and
names
of
witnesses,
but
that
the
statute
could
not
permit
such
use
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
the
constitutional
command.
in
fact
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well,
in
this
case
there
is
admitted
violation
of
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
this
court's
holding
in
miranda
was
that
in
the
absence
of
all
the
warnings
required
therein
the
compulsion
inherit
in
interrogation
process
could
not
be
met,
so
that
any
statement
given
was
for
constitutional
purposes
compelled.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
a
position
to
argue
holding
versus
the
victim,
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
appropriate
because
even
if
miranda
was
not
decided
on
constitutional
grounds,
this
court
has
never
required
a
violation
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct
and
it
is
my
position
that
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
there
was
independent
source
for
the
discovery
of
the
gun.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
such
as
a
finger
print
i
would
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
or
ballistics,
that
would
still
be
a
direct
and
immediate
result
of
a
constitutional
violation
over
his
rights.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
but
this
court
since
in
nardone
has
refused
to
distinguish
between
direct
and
derivative
fruits
of
illegal
activity
and
in
fact,
the
court's
concluding
paragraph
in
the
calandra
case
expressly
reiterates
the
notion
that
direct
–-
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
similarly
in
a
prophylactic
rule.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
in
order
for
miranda
to
be
affective,
there
must
be
remove
any
incentive
to
violate
it
and
if
a
police
officers
is
able
to
use
in
court,
verbal
evidence
which
is
directly
derived
from
a
violation
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly,
the
testimony
of
the
witness.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
his
testimony
which
was
obtained
--
it
is
testimony
which
was
obtained
solely
and
directly
as
a
result
of
a
statement
elicited
from
the
defendant
in
violation
of
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
consistency
limited
the
application
of
the
fruits
doctrine
to
those
situations
where
the
deterrence
aspect
would
be
met.
and
i
believe
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there
is
not
distinction
between
physical
and
verbal
evidence
that
in
point
the
fact
an
officer
would
be
encouraged
to
violate
miranda
if
you
were
able
to
use
the
witness
such
as
was
found
here.
and
that
the
deterrent
purposes
recognized
in
wong
sun
and
in
the
prior
cases
would
require
rejection
of
the
proposed
distinction
between
a
witness
and
physical
testimony.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
on
the
basis
of
the
hypothetical
as
you
pose
it
mr.
chief
justice.
i
see
no
relationship
between
the
any
police
legality
and
the
cross
examination
of
the
witness.
and
for
that
reason
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
in
that
case
there
will
be
no
relationship.
there
will
be
no
evidentiary
gain
to
the
prosecution
from
its
misconduct
to
find
this
gender
hypothetical
correctly.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
you
have
hypothesized,
the
question
i
feel
incapable
of
giving
a
definitive
answer.
i
think
that
the
question
would
ultimately
depend
on
the
same
principles
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
there
was
independent
source
for
the
discovery
of
that
victim
then
of
course,
witness
testimony
would
be
admissible.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes,
however
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
however,
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
result
in
your
case
because
since
kidnaps
are
normally
for
the
purpose
of
ransom.
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
kidnapper
initially
to
make
the
identity
of
the
victim
known
so
that
there
is
no
direct
relationship
between
the
illegality
of
that
act
of
breaking
in
and
discovering
the
existence
identity
of
the
witness.
so
that
in
fact
the
witness
testimony
would
be
admissible.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
because
that
did
not
lead
the
police
to
the
existence
and
identity
of
the
witness.
there
are
maybe
a
partial
exclusion,
involves
such
as
is
involved
in
the
wade
and
gilbert
situation
where
if
there
is
an
independence
source
for
identifying
a
defendant
apart
from
an
illegal
lineup,
the
witness
may
still
come
in
to
court,
testify
as
the
identity
of
the
defendant
on
the
basis
of
a
previous
observation,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
the
observation
of
the
lineup.
so
that
the
witness
may
well
be
permitted
to
testify
as
a
complaining
witness,
but
perhaps
and
i
just
do
not
have
an
answer
that
right
now
as
to
the
offense
related
to
the
illegal
break
in.
the
test
which
was
--
which
is
proposed
by
petitioner,
i
submit
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated
is
inconsistent
with
the
deterrent
principles
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as
previously
fashioned
by
this
court.
but
i
believe
that
the
test
should
be
rejected
for
reasons
beyond
that
because
in
those
courts
which
have
attempted
to
apply
the
test,
it
is
proven
to
be
a
workable.
to
begin
with,
the
test
attempts
to
derive
definite
conclusions
from
the
acts
which
are
ambiguous,
qualitatively
more
so
than
many
others
which
the
law
permits,
definite
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from.
and
think,
this
is
demonstrated
in
the
experience
of
courts
which
have
attempted
to
imply
to
apply
the
smith
and
bowden
test.
none
has
articulated
any
consistence
standards
towards
application
and
in
point
of
fact
while
smith
and
bowden
and
edwards,
the
witness'
initial
reluctance
which
was
later
overcome
was
viewed
as
attenuating
factor
which
justified
admissibility
of
the
witness
testimony
in
the
taint
case
the
same
factual
context
was
viewed
is
exploitation
of
taint
requiring
suppression.
in
the
original
preceding
this
case
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
the
same
result
that
was
reached
in
smith
and
bowden
was
reached
on
the
basis
of
the
exact
opposite
reasoning.
the
court
presuming
without
any
foundation
in
the
record,
i
might
add,
that
henderson’s
testimony
was
probably
voluntary,
therefore
there
was
no
exploitation.
therefore
the
witness
testimony
should
be
admissible
and
in
smith
and
anderson,
the
witness'
initial
reluctance,
i
am
sorry
the
witness'
initial
willingness
was
viewed
as
insufficient
to
break
the
clausal
chain
--
to
taint
a
chain.
there
is
no
policy
considerations
which
permit
the
court
to
distinguish
among
these
contradictory
applications
because
of
the
fact
none
of
them
go
to
the
traditional
test
of
deterrence
which
this
court
is
applied
that
is
the
relationship
between
the
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
sought
to
be
suppressed.
and
ultimately
this
test
by
focusing
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
witness'
decision
to
testify,
would
have
the
administration
of
important
constitutional
principles
depend
on
the
emotions
of
the
witness
and
his
feelings
towards
the
defendant,
the
victim,
the
courts
and
the
police.
i
think
that
smith
and
bowden
test
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly
but
how
the
police
came
to
find
the
witness
is
not
something
which
maybe
reached
by
cross
examination,
so
that
the
statement
that
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
those
factors
go
to
the
weight
of
the
admissi
--
to
the
weight
of
evidence
but
not
to
its
inadmissibility
because
they
have
no
bearing
on
the
constitutional
principles
at
stake.
i
believe
that
the
smith
and
bowden
test
has
for
this
reasons
shown
itself
to
the
unworkable
and
that
the
principles
previously
annunciated
by
this
court
have
shown
themselves
to
be
capable
of
minimizing
the
loss
of
evidence
by
the
various
requirements
of
standing
attenuation
independent
source.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems
which
the
courts
that
have
attempt
to
apply
the
test
have
found
themselves
in
is
that
they
have
not
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
distinguishing
live
physical
fruits
on
the
basis
of
voluntariness
of
the
witness'
decision
to
testify.
the
characterization
of
the
decision
to
testify
is
attenuation
or
exploitation
has
turned
on
the
individual
judges'
assessments
rather
than
on
the
facts
going
to
voluntariness
of
the
decision
to
testify
and
so,
i
think
the
test
ultimately
is
part
of
the
voluntariness
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
the
difficulties
here
have
shown
themselves
however
to
be
of
such
magnitude
that
the
test
has
been
unworkable
and
i
think
that
for
this
court
who
adopt
it
would
besides
undercutting
the
established
principles
of
exclusionary
rule,
would
--
the
court
would
adopt
a
test
which
this
court
concede
today
on
the
basis
of
the
test
or
the
cases
which
apply
the
test
is
an
unworkable
test.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
believe
that
the
–
no,
i
have
said
to
my
brief,
i
have
not
talk
about
it
here.
judge
gazelle’s
opinion
in
the
austin
case
attempted
to
apply
the
conflicting
opinions
from
the
dc
circuit
and
judge
gazelle
concluded
that
the
test
was
in
such
unusable
safe
that
to
decide
the
question
in
austin
he
had
to
return
to
the
primary
principles
of
exclusionary
rule
and
with
those
resolved
the
case
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
evidence
in
that
case
was
suppressed.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well,
in
that
situation
mr.
wong
sun
had
been
arraigned
by
a
magistrate
and
had
come
back
voluntarily
several
days
later
after
having
had
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that
goes
to
a
distinction
i
think
between
the
position
of
a
witness,
who
has
no
alternative
of
not
coming
into
court
and
testify,
and
a
person
who
has
a
potential
dependence,
such
as
wong
sun
who
after
being
arraigned
then
came
in
and
this
court
held
that
his
decision
to
testify
was
sufficiently
remote
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
a
witness
has
no
choice
not
to
testify.
once
the
police
have
obtained
and
have
come
upon
his
existence
and
identity.
the
court’s
opinion
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes,
but
i
am
distinguishing
between
the
situation
of
an
accomplice
witness
who
has
a
privilege
and
a
witness
who
is
not
an
accomplice,
who
does
not
have
the
privilege.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
but
in
situation
of
a
witness
to
a
crime
who
is
not
himself
a
suspect.
there
is
no
privilege
which
would
permit
that
witness
to
come
into
court
and
say,
“i
refuse
to
testify
just
because
i
do
not
want
to.”
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
don’t
believe
at
all
your
point.
the
second
question
which
i
wish
to
address
goes
to
the
miranda
question
and
the
question
before
this
court,
at
this
point
in
time,
is
not
whether
miranda
should
have
been
adopted
although
i
submit
that
it
was
correctly
adopted,
but
rather
given
the
existence
of
miranda
as
the
operation
of
that
decision
in
the
last
state
years
been
shown
to
be
so
harmful
to
law
enforcement
in
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
as
to
justify
departure
from
the
principles
of
stare
decisis.
the
available
evidence
indicates
that
no
harm
has
come
to
law
enforcement
as
a
result
of
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
see
no
harm
the
law
enforcement
and
requiring
the
police
to
gain
--
in
permitting
the
police
to
gain
no
evidentiary
advantage
as
a
result
with
their
own
illegality.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
certainly.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well,
unless
this
court
overrules
johnson,
then
this
case
must
be
due
in
the
context
of
a
miranda
violation
which
took
place
after
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
that
–
well,
i
would
urge
this
court
not
to
reconsider
johnson.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
i
mean,
i
am
not
attempting
to
evade
your
question
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
am
just
attempting
to
put
the
various
points
in
my
answer
in
an
order.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
appreciable
impact
whatever
on
the
administration
of
justice
by
reconsideration
of
johnson
at
this
point
in
time
and
for
that
reason
alone,
it
should
not
be
reconsidered.
however
in
response
to
your
question,
i
believe
that
the
centrality
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact
finding
process
at
trial
sufficiently
justifies
the
decision
in
johnson
as
to
make
that
a
close
question
before
in
this
court
today.
the
miranda
decision
was
necessary
--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
what
this
court
found
in
miranda,
i
submit
is
that
application
of
the
old
due
process
test
had
shown
itself
to
be
so
incapable
of
protecting
the
privilege
that
the
integrity
of
the
trial
process
was
in
jeopardy.
and
that
without
a
strict
rule
requiring
the
police
to
inform
a
suspect
of
all
of
those
rights
which
are
most
critical
at
that
time
and
reminding
the
police
of
restraints
the
law
imposes
upon
them,
that
a
trial
was
in
danger
of
becoming
that
might
appeal
from
the
interrogation
process.
these
facts
were
so
deeply
to
the
part
of
our
legal
system
that
the
decision
in
johnson,
applying
miranda
partially
retroactively
is
certainly
not
out
of
line
with
the
prior
--
with
other
decisions
of
this
court
involving
retroactivity.
today
--
the
police
today
are
familiar
with
the
miranda
decision
and
they
are
fully
incorporated
into
their
day-to-day
workings.
and
mr.
gribbs
my
co-counsel,
representing
detroit
bar
association
will
address
himself
to
that
to
a
point
in
addition
to
my
remarks.
miranda
has
had
a
beneficial
impact
on
law
enforcement
in
toto
and
that
it
provides
the
police
with
a
clear
standard
for
determining
what
their
own
limits
are
and
what
they
may
or
may
not
do.
and
it
also
has
provided
the
courts
with
an
objective
standard
against
which
to
measure
any
claims
of
waiver.
and
as
to
the
waiver
question,
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
a
question
this
morning
as
to
any
michigan
cases
on
that
point.
there’s
a
recent
case
in
michigan
court
of
appeals
case,
people
v.
mcclendon,
the
citation
which
escapes
me
but
in
that
case
the
defendant
had
been
given
the
applicable
miranda
warnings
had
refused
to
sign
a
waiver
and
had
made
a
statement,
and
the
trial
court
that
held
that
there
was
a
valid
waiver.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
--
the
conviction
and
remanded
it
for
hearing
saying
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
on
those
facts.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
that’s
correct.
i
believe
that’s
what
your
question
had
been
this
morning.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
unless
one
can
imagine
the
situation
of
a
police
officer
utilizing
a
suspect
and
at
the
same
time,
reciting
the
warnings.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
while
doing
that.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i’ve
thought
of
that.
the
decision
in
miranda
is
also
sound
constitutional
policy
or
to
be
paraphrase
from
the
escobedo
decision,
there’s
no
place
in
the
democracy
where
a
system
of
criminal
law
which
comes
to
depend
for
its
continued
effectiveness
and
citizen’s
abdication
through
unawareness
of
their
constitutional
rights.
the
objections
to
the
miranda
decision
which
are
urged
before
this
court
do
not
go
to
any
claim
that
miranda
has
caused
an
increase
of
crime
which
it
clearly
has
not.
but
rather
to
its
alleged
inflexibility.
the
modifications
which
are
urged,
however,
each
of
them
would
swallow
up
the
rule
and
effectively
overrule
the
case.
i
think
it
is
incorrect
to
state
that
failure
to
advise
an
indigent
of
his
right
to
court
appointed
counsel
is
a
mere
technicality.
nor
could
it
be
considered
a
technicality
not
to
advise
someone
of
the
right
to
silence
in
a
single
basis
for
distinguishing
among
failure
to
advise
a
person
of
anyone
of
those
rights.
inadvertence,
like
good
faith
is
irrelevant
and
i
would
submit
that
none
of
the
modifications
urged
in
miranda
would
be
capable
of
effectuating
that
decision
as
each
of
them
would
swallow
the
decision.
and
i
give
the
rest
of
my
time
to
the
detroit
bar
association,
and
mr.
gribbs
will
address
himself
to
the
experiences
of
the
police
in
applying
miranda.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
