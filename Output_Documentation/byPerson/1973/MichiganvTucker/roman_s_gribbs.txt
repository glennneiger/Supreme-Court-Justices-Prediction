mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
my
brother
counsel
has
indicated,
i’m
here
on
behalf
of
the
detroit
bar
association
that
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
connection
with
issue
number
two
as
it
is
presented
by
the
petitioner.
the
briefs
speaks
to
that
issue
and
i
will
limit
my
remarks
to
that
issue
and
make
it
fairly
brief.
i
would
like
to
speak
toward
the
rationale
of
the
miranda
decision
ever
so
briefly
and
then
the
practical
results
in
the
last
seven-and-a-half,
eight
years
in
connection
with
miranda
and
all
of
its
implications.
before
i
do,
let
me
simply
remind
this
court
that
it
asserts
that
the
court
stepped
backwards
into
history
insofar
as
the
practices
and
procedures
required
under
miranda.
petitioner
alleges
that
miranda
was
too
restrictive
and
thus
urge
to
this
court
to
allow
the
test
to
go
back
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
that
had
been
operative
before
miranda.
let
me
remind
the
court
that
the
miranda
warnings
were
not
all
new
in
1966.
one
was
added;
the
warning
as
to
statement
that
is
not
to
be
used
against
an
individual
--
the
fact
that
it
need
not
make
a
statement
was
practiced
before
miranda,
the
fact
that
it
did
and
it
was
used,
it
was
practiced
before
miranda.
escobedo
established
a
practice
of
an
attorney
and
finally
miranda
said,
“if
you
can’t
afford
it,
the
court
will
appoint
you
an
attorney.”
so,
that
four-fold
statement
and
of
course
the
requirements
as
to
waiver
as
was
set
forth,
were
clearly
set
forth
would
settle
that
question.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
the
last
one.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
yes,
the
attorney
is
court.
the
appointed
attorney,
although
that’s
not
quite
as
clear,
assuming
escobedo
required
the
fact
that
you
can
have
an
attorney
present
and
if
so
construed
and
then
the
miranda
warning
was
really
the
fourth
one.
the
rationale,
may
it
please
the
court,
i’m
sure
it’s
very
well-known
to
this
court.
let
me
simply
point
out
that
what
miranda
protects
goes
to
the
very
roots
of
the
american
criminal
jurisprudence.
it
puts
life
and
meaning
into
provisions
that
are
in
the
constitution.
what
it
really
does
is
put
into
the
street,
if
you
will,
put
into
the
police
station
the
knowledge
or
the
protection
--
protective
aspects
of
the
constitution.
the
warnings
are
given
as
now
required.
there
are
interrogations.
they
are
continued
if
there
is
waiver.
there
are,
as
a
result
of
miranda
and
after
miranda
confessions
that
are
garnered
in
spite
of
the
miranda
warnings.
in
the
process
of
applying
miranda,
the
court
found
expressly
in
that
case,
that
as
my
brother
counsel
indicated,
that
other
tests
or
measures
to
make
those
that
are
uninformed
aware
of
these
rights
and
to
prevent
police
practices
that
were
abrogating
those
rights,
that
this
was
the
minimum
requirement
before
admissions
or
confessions
were
allowed
into
court.
the
court
found
that
in
custody
interrogations
were
inherently
coercive,
be
they
physical
but
in
these
modern
days,
psychological.
that
there
just
as
no
contest
between
the
sophisticated
police
officer
on
this
side
and
the
accused
that
is
frightened
on
this
side.
it
was
really
an
adversary
and
is
an
adversary
proceeding
every
time
that
there
was
an
arrest,
generally
speaking,
of
course.
on
one
hand,
we
have
lieutenant
patterson
here
that
trained
either,
perhaps
with
a
degree
or
years
of
experience
in
interrogations
in
bringing
out,
if
you
will,
questions
and
answers
that
would
incriminate.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
the
accused
that
in
all
likelihood,
has
no
education
or
very
little
and
certainly
no
sophistication
in
the
rules
of
law.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
i’m
here
speaking
solely
--
excuse
me?
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
no,
i’m
speaking
solely
to
the
rationale
and
the
basis
in
the
continuation
of
miranda
itself
which
is
the
second
issue
presented
to
the
court
and
not
the
“fruits”
doctrine.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
i
can,
if
it
please
the
court
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
--
[voice
overlap]
and
our
brief
is
limited
only
to
the
miranda
itself
as
being
directly
attacked
as
being
too
restrictive
and
that
bit
and
that
rule
should
be
modified.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
we
join
in
his
general
request
with
the
bar
association
as
such
did
not
brief
it
and
do
not
speak
to
it
and
we’re
speaking
to
miranda
only.
but
in
any
rate
--
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
and
that’s
sir
what
i
was
about
to
speak
to.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
first,
--
yes.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
ever
so
slightly,
in
a
very
insignificant
fashion.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
no,
i
think,
it
would
make
a
great
difference
because
there
are
individual
cases
i’ve
known
where
the
warnings
protect
the
innocent.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
and
that’s
the
objective
of
the
law
and
that’s
the
reason
for
the
protective
provisions
in
the
constitution.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
insofar
as
we
do
see
the
confessions
or
admissions.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
impact
as
to
number
of
confessions
that
are
introduced,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
what
i
intended
when
i
said
that.
for
example,
at
pittsburgh
study
--
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
it
has
the
impact
of
professionalizing
the
operations
of
the
police
department.
it
has
the
impact
of
advising
individual
of
the
constitutional
rights
and
in
number
of
cases,
avoiding
the
use
of
their
admissions
or
confessions
in
their
trial.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
yes.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
well,
in
counting
the
numbers,
we
can
only
start
what
the
surveys
indicate
and
the
numbers
indicate
in
one
study
in
pittsburgh
where
there
was
a
reduction
of
about
a
third
in
the
number
of
confessions
introduced.
there
were
no
reductions
--
pardon
me,
there’s
a
one-half
of
one
percent
reduction
in
convictions
in
that
same
court.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
only
the
individual
cases
where
they’ve
been
excluded,
but
as
to
a
study
of
the
total
exclusions
or
not,
we
have
just
a
few
that
are
cited
in
general
terms
in
the
briefs.
for
example,
a
study
was
conducted
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
determine
the
degree
of
increase
or
decrease
of
interrogations
after
miranda.
it
was
made
in
1968
and
cited
in
michigan
law
review
and
it
said
there
was
no
substantial
variation
in
the
number
of
interrogations
here
in
this
area.
but
that
does
not
take
away,
certainly,
there’s
no
reason,
in
fact,
there
are
reason
to
retain
the
miranda
rule
for
it
does
put
life
into
individual
cases
and
it’s
not
a
deterrent
to
law
enforcement
as
such.
the
way
to
determine
its
impact
on
law
enforcement
was
to
talk
to
those
in
law
enforcement.
and
there
are
statements
we
plead
in
the
briefs
coming
from
prosecuting
attorneys,
mr.
younger
who
now
joins
the
prosecutor
in
opposing
and
filing
a
brief
our
opposition
to
miranda
but
several
years
ago,
he
stated
as
district
attorney
that
he
did
not
find
any
deleterious
effect
or
impact
as
a
result
of
miranda
in
its
operations.
and
likewise
prosecutor
of
wayne
my
area
and
i
myself,
may
the
court
please,
had
been
on
law
enforcement
for
some
12,
15
years
as
prosecuting
attorney
and
sheriff
of
wayne
county,
during
this
time,
the
changing
of
the
rule.
well,
let
me
conclude,
if
i
may,
with
just
of
these
notations
that
in
1966,
which
i
feel
have
bearing
under
practical
impact
of
miranda.
in
1966,
when
this
court
was
hearing
the
miranda
case
some
27
cases,
states
rather,
joined
in
opposition
to
the
proposed
then
miranda
rule.
and
they
are
cited
in
the
dissent.
today
you
have
that
lone
brief
joining
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
his
urging
that
miranda
be
overruled.
miranda
set
standards
that
were
minimal
and
to
be
enforced
but
they
did
not
and
in
fact,
the
opinion
expressly
says
that
if
states
so
chose
as
long
as
they
met
the
minimal
standards,
they
could
use
a
different
means
or
a
mechanism
to
safeguard
these
standards.
today,
not
one
state
has
attempted
to
set
up
a
different
mechanism,
meeting
those
same
standards
as
set
forth
in
miranda,
there
is
by
an
indirection,
if
not
directly
on
occasion
a
reference
in
some
of
the
briefs
that
because
of
miranda,
the
increase
in
crime
that’s
been
reported
over
a
few
years
is
direct
or
indirect
result
of
miranda.
the
fact
is
that
crime
is
going
down
in
many
communities
and
in
the
city
of
detroit
it
has
gone
down
three
years
in
a
row.
in
1971,
it
went
down
five
percent,
in
1972
it
went
down
16%,
and
in
1973
it
has
gone
down
an
additional
five
percent
in
round
numbers.
so,
there
was
a
decrease
in
crime
in
certain
areas.
so,
we
urge
it
and
may
it
please
the
court
that
the
rule
not
be
modified
or
rescinded.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
my
brother
counsel
has
indicated,
i’m
here
on
behalf
of
the
detroit
bar
association
that
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
connection
with
issue
number
two
as
it
is
presented
by
the
petitioner.
the
briefs
speaks
to
that
issue
and
i
will
limit
my
remarks
to
that
issue
and
make
it
fairly
brief.
i
would
like
to
speak
toward
the
rationale
of
the
miranda
decision
ever
so
briefly
and
then
the
practical
results
in
the
last
seven-and-a-half,
eight
years
in
connection
with
miranda
and
all
of
its
implications.
before
i
do,
let
me
simply
remind
this
court
that
it
asserts
that
the
court
stepped
backwards
into
history
insofar
as
the
practices
and
procedures
required
under
miranda.
petitioner
alleges
that
miranda
was
too
restrictive
and
thus
urge
to
this
court
to
allow
the
test
to
go
back
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
that
had
been
operative
before
miranda.
let
me
remind
the
court
that
the
miranda
warnings
were
not
all
new
in
1966.
one
was
added;
the
warning
as
to
statement
that
is
not
to
be
used
against
an
individual
--
the
fact
that
it
need
not
make
a
statement
was
practiced
before
miranda,
the
fact
that
it
did
and
it
was
used,
it
was
practiced
before
miranda.
escobedo
established
a
practice
of
an
attorney
and
finally
miranda
said,
“if
you
can’t
afford
it,
the
court
will
appoint
you
an
attorney.”
so,
that
four-fold
statement
and
of
course
the
requirements
as
to
waiver
as
was
set
forth,
were
clearly
set
forth
would
settle
that
question.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
the
last
one.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
yes,
the
attorney
is
court.
the
appointed
attorney,
although
that’s
not
quite
as
clear,
assuming
escobedo
required
the
fact
that
you
can
have
an
attorney
present
and
if
so
construed
and
then
the
miranda
warning
was
really
the
fourth
one.
the
rationale,
may
it
please
the
court,
i’m
sure
it’s
very
well-known
to
this
court.
let
me
simply
point
out
that
what
miranda
protects
goes
to
the
very
roots
of
the
american
criminal
jurisprudence.
it
puts
life
and
meaning
into
provisions
that
are
in
the
constitution.
what
it
really
does
is
put
into
the
street,
if
you
will,
put
into
the
police
station
the
knowledge
or
the
protection
--
protective
aspects
of
the
constitution.
the
warnings
are
given
as
now
required.
there
are
interrogations.
they
are
continued
if
there
is
waiver.
there
are,
as
a
result
of
miranda
and
after
miranda
confessions
that
are
garnered
in
spite
of
the
miranda
warnings.
in
the
process
of
applying
miranda,
the
court
found
expressly
in
that
case,
that
as
my
brother
counsel
indicated,
that
other
tests
or
measures
to
make
those
that
are
uninformed
aware
of
these
rights
and
to
prevent
police
practices
that
were
abrogating
those
rights,
that
this
was
the
minimum
requirement
before
admissions
or
confessions
were
allowed
into
court.
the
court
found
that
in
custody
interrogations
were
inherently
coercive,
be
they
physical
but
in
these
modern
days,
psychological.
that
there
just
as
no
contest
between
the
sophisticated
police
officer
on
this
side
and
the
accused
that
is
frightened
on
this
side.
it
was
really
an
adversary
and
is
an
adversary
proceeding
every
time
that
there
was
an
arrest,
generally
speaking,
of
course.
on
one
hand,
we
have
lieutenant
patterson
here
that
trained
either,
perhaps
with
a
degree
or
years
of
experience
in
interrogations
in
bringing
out,
if
you
will,
questions
and
answers
that
would
incriminate.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
the
accused
that
in
all
likelihood,
has
no
education
or
very
little
and
certainly
no
sophistication
in
the
rules
of
law.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
i’m
here
speaking
solely
--
excuse
me?
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
no,
i’m
speaking
solely
to
the
rationale
and
the
basis
in
the
continuation
of
miranda
itself
which
is
the
second
issue
presented
to
the
court
and
not
the
“fruits”
doctrine.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
i
can,
if
it
please
the
court
[voice

--
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
--
[voice

and
our
brief
is
limited
only
to
the
miranda
itself
as
being
directly
attacked
as
being
too
restrictive
and
that
bit
and
that
rule
should
be
modified.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
we
join
in
his
general
request
with
the
bar
association
as
such
did
not
brief
it
and
do
not
speak
to
it
and
we’re
speaking
to
miranda
only.
but
in
any
rate
--
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
and
that’s
sir
what
i
was
about
to
speak
to.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
first,
--
yes.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
ever
so
slightly,
in
a
very
insignificant
fashion.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
no,
i
think,
it
would
make
a
great
difference
because
there
are
individual
cases
i’ve

where
the
warnings
protect
the

mr.

and
that’s
the
objective
of
the
law
and
that’s
the
reason
for
the
protective
provisions
in
the
constitution.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
insofar
as
we
do
see
the
confessions
or
admissions.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
impact
as
to
number
of
confessions
that
are
introduced,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
what
i
intended
when
i
said
that.
for
example,
at
pittsburgh
study
--
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
it
has
the
impact
of
professionalizing
the
operations
of
the
police
department.
it
has
the
impact
of
advising
individual
of
the
constitutional
rights
and
in
number
of
cases,
avoiding
the
use
of
their
admissions
or
confessions
in
their
trial.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
yes.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
well,
in
counting
the
numbers,
we
can
only
start
what
the
surveys
indicate
and
the
numbers
indicate
in
one
study
in
pittsburgh
where
there
was
a
reduction
of
about
a
third
in
the
number
of
confessions
introduced.
there
were
no
reductions
--
pardon
me,
there’s
a
one-half
of
one
percent
reduction
in
convictions
in
that
same
court.
mr.
roman
s.
gribbs
only
the
individual
cases
where
they’ve
been
excluded,
but
as
to
a
study
of
the
total
exclusions
or
not,
we
have
just
a
few
that
are
cited
in
general
terms
in
the
briefs.
for
example,
a
study
was
conducted
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
determine
the
degree
of
increase
or
decrease
of
interrogations
after
miranda.
it
was
made
in
1968
and
cited
in
michigan
law
review
and
it
said
there
was
no
substantial
variation
in
the
number
of
interrogations
here
in
this
area.
but
that
does
not
take
away,
certainly,
there’s
no
reason,
in
fact,
there
are
reason
to
retain
the
miranda
rule
for
it
does
put
life
into
individual
cases
and
it’s
not
a
deterrent
to
law
enforcement
as
such.
the
way
to
determine
its
impact
on
law
enforcement
was
to
talk
to
those
in
law
enforcement.
and
there
are
statements
we
plead
in
the
briefs
coming
from
prosecuting
attorneys,
mr.
younger
who
now
joins
the
prosecutor
in
opposing
and
filing
a
brief
our
opposition
to
miranda
but
several
years
ago,
he
stated
as
district
attorney
that
he
did
not
find
any
deleterious
effect
or
impact
as
a
result
of
miranda
in
its
operations.
and
likewise
prosecutor
of
wayne
my
area
and
i
myself,
may
the
court
please,
had
been
on
law
enforcement
for
some
12,
15
years
as
prosecuting
attorney
and
sheriff
of
wayne
county,
during
this
time,
the
changing
of
the
rule.
well,
let
me
conclude,
if
i
may,
with
just
of
these
notations
that
in
1966,
which
i
feel
have
bearing
under
practical
impact
of
miranda.
in
1966,
when
this
court
was
hearing
the
miranda
case
some
27
cases,
states
rather,
joined
in
opposition
to
the
proposed
then
miranda
rule.
and
they
are
cited
in
the
dissent.
today
you
have
that
lone
brief
joining
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
his
urging
that
miranda
be
overruled.
miranda
set
standards
that
were
minimal
and
to
be
enforced
but
they
did
not
and
in
fact,
the
opinion
expressly
says
that
if
states
so
chose
as
long
as
they
met
the
minimal
standards,
they
could
use
a
different
means
or
a
mechanism
to
safeguard
these
standards.
today,
not
one
state
has
attempted
to
set
up
a
different
mechanism,
meeting
those
same
standards
as
set
forth
in
miranda,
there
is
by
an
indirection,
if
not
directly
on
occasion
a
reference
in
some
of
the
briefs
that
because
of
miranda,
the
increase
in
crime
that’s
been
reported
over
a
few
years
is
direct
or
indirect
result
of
miranda.
the
fact
is
that
crime
is
going
down
in
many
communities
and
in
the
city
of
detroit
it
has
gone
down
three
years
in
a
row.
in
1971,
it
went
down
five
percent,
in
1972
it
went
down
16%,
and
in
1973
it
has
gone
down
an
additional
five
percent
in
round
numbers.
so,
there
was
a
decrease
in
crime
in
certain
areas.
so,
we
urge
it
and
may
it
please
the
court
that
the
rule
not
be
modified
or
rescinded.
