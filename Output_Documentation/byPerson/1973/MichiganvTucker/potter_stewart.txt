justice
potter
stewart
was
he
told
--
was
he
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
then
and
there?
justice
potter
stewart
oh.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
city
of
pontiac?
justice
potter
stewart
all
you’d
have
be
perhaps
a
new
trial
--
justice
potter
stewart
after
many
--
that’s
covered
by
jenkins
against
delaware?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
patterson
you
say
that
was
a
--
this
whole
mini
trial
is
a
step
one
and
then
you
go
on
to
see
if
in
fact
the
statement
was
a
voluntary
or
involuntary,
are
there
any
cases
in
michigan
that
hold
that
even
after
all
of
the
so-called
miranda
rights
were
accorded
that
the
statement
was
involuntary?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
think
we
have
ever
seen
a
case
since
you
are
on
a
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
no.
my
hypothesis
is
all
the
rights
were
accorded.
he
was
told
that
he
didn’t
say
anything
and
he
was
told
he
can
have
a
lawyer
and
if
you
didn’t
want
it,
couldn’t
hire
a
lawyer,
the
state
would
have
furnish
him
one
then
and
there
and
all
of
that
and
then
are
there
cases
in
michigan
that
after
all
that
was
done
that
have
held
that
this
statement
was
involuntary?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
holding
in
this
case
that
the
statement
was
involuntary?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
because
they
--
the
miranda
rules
are
violated.
there
was
no
holding
this,
this
was
involuntary,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
the
statements
were
inadmissible
under
--
his
statement
was
inadmissible
under
tucker
and
under
miranda.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
not
an
issue
here
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
and
the
opinion
in
that
case
sharply
distinguished
the
miranda
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
first
aspect?
what
if
we
had
here
a
or
a
hypothetical
case
of
coerced
confession
and
in
that
coerced
confession,
mr.
tucker,
talked
about
this
witness?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
the
rule
in
england,
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
england
doesn’t
have
our
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
stipulation
as
i
understand
it
is
that
they
probably
--
the
state
learned
of
this
witness
only
through
the
statement
made
by
mr.
tucker
which
statement
was
made
in
violation
of
his
miranda
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
a
given
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you
referred
several
times
to
smith
and
bowden
test
is
--
i
haven’t
reread
that.
i
don’t
have
that
opinion
in
front
of
me
but
as
i
recollect
that
was
--
the
holding
in
that
case
is
kind
of
alternative
one
wasn’t
it?
at
first
at
the
initial
tape
had
been
dissipated
is
that,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
secondly,
it
was
emphasized
that
this
was
unlike
gun
or
the
county
eleven
this
was
human
being
and
that
the
elements
of
the
violation
and
so
on
were
came
into
admit
in
different
case.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
when
you
were
talking
about
the
smith
and
bowden
test,
what
are
you
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
by
the
test
by
the
smith
and
bowden
test?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
is
not
per
se
rule
and
since
it
is
not,
they
are
will
be
always
be
difficulties
in
its
application,
isn’t
that
right,
to
varying
factual
situations?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
so
the
issue
there
was
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
waiver?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was,
and
i
asked
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
that
he
know
of
any
case,
anywhere
really,
where
miranda
had
been
fully
complied
with
in
every
respect
and
there
was
a
finding
that
the
statement
was
coerced.
it
seems
to
me
almost
a
contradiction
of
terms
but
it
there
were
suggested
an
argument
that
going
through
the
miranda
is
just
step
one,
and
then
you
--
step
two
is
to
find
out
whether
even
though
miranda
was
complied
with,
the
statement
was
coerced.
and
i
wondered
if
there
was
any
case,
anywhere
holding
that
miranda
was
fully
complied
with
but
nonetheless,
the
statement
was
coerced.
it
would
seem
to
me
rather
an
odd
situation
if
there
is
such
a
case.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
was
he
told
--
was
he
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
then
and
there?
justice
potter
stewart
oh.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
city
of
pontiac?
justice
potter
stewart
all
you’d
have
be
perhaps
a
new

--
justice

mr.

i
do
not
think
we
have
ever
seen
a
case
since
you
are
on
a
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
no.
my
hypothesis
is
all
the
rights
were
accorded.
he
was
told
that
he
didn’t
say
anything
and
he
was
told
he
can
have
a
lawyer
and
if
you
didn’t
want
it,
couldn’t

the

would

all

that

that
have
held
that

justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
holding
in

case
that
the
statement
was
involuntary?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
because
they
--
the
miranda
rules
are
violated.
there
was
no
holding
this,
this
was
involuntary,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
the
statements
were
inadmissible
under
--
his
statement
was
inadmissible
under
tucker
and
under
miranda.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
not
an
issue
here
at
