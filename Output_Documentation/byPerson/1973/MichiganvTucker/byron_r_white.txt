justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
you
have
miranda
would
be
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
would
be
any
--
they're
good.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
they
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
in
fact
applied
to
its
fullest
extent
to
use
your
words,
back
in
the
pre-miranda
days
when
the
court
thought
that
what
was
applicable
here
was
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
korman,
have
there
been
good
many
cases
on
whether
failure
to
comply
with
miranda
warnings
is
also
an
exclusion
of
physical,
tangible
evidence
which
is
found
through
the
use
of
the
answers
to
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
the
alaska
federal
law
where
is
the
gun
and
he
says
its
under
the
dresser
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that’s
the
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
--
do
you
think
that’s
an
easier
or
harder
case
for
you
to
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
can
say,
do
you
think
they
are
on
the
same
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
brought
this
argument
before
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
--
what
do
you
use
against
him
is
on
his
words
or
his
submission
but
some
non
testimonial
objects
then
the
question
is
how
far
you
going
to
extend
the
fruits
doctrine
as
a
rule
to
implement
the
basic
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
the
argument?
assume
a
question
in
violation
with
miranda
where
is
the
gun
and
he
says
and
you
find
the
gun
and
independently
you
connect
the
gun
to
the
defendant.
you
never
use
as
admission
in
court,
now
what’s
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
no,
no
there
is
not
independence
source,
coincidently
it
came
from
the
defendant
but
the
gun
is
found
and
offered
in
evidence
and
it
is
connected
to
him
by
evidence
independent
of
any
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
finger
print
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
not
offering
his
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
itself
is
prophylactic
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
now
you
want
to
put
--
so
you
are
suggesting
you
should
have
a
prophylactic
rule
on
a
prophylactic
rule
to
be
sure
and
get
all
the
fruits
in
order
to
make
the
prophylactic
rule
more
prophylactic?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
he
does
using
the
verbal
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
not
his
witness.
i
mean,
it
is
not
the
defendant's
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
still
though
how
far
do
you
carry
the
fruits
doctrine?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
distinguish
the
testimony
that
was
admitted
in
wong
sun
that
was
obtained
from
wong
sun
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
didn't
--
they
had
no
idea
that
he
was
connected
with
this
crime
until
they
exploited
the
information
they
got
from
blacky
toy
in
an
illegal
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
order
to
find
wong
--
to
know
about
wong
sun,
they
did
it
right
then
and
there.
they
found
about
it
immediately
and
then,
the
information
however
that
--
his
testimony
came
later
or
his
information
he
came
in.
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
think
it
will
run
the
other
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
after
giving
him
the
warnings?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
if
you’re
speaking
on
that
level
and
perhaps
you
will
help
me
out.
what
has
the
impact
of
miranda
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
it’s
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it’s
deterred
admissions
and
confessions
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
it
really
wouldn’t
make
very
much
difference
whether
it
was
overruled
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you’re
saying
--
you
say
the
impact
has
been
ever
so
slight?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
--
i
mean,
if
it’s
so,
do
you
think
if
it’s
been
very
--
it
had
a
very
strong
impact
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
other
impact
does
it
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
hasn’t
had
the
impact
of
preventing
some
admissions
that
otherwise
might
have
been
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
substantial
as
was
stated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
not
what
i’m
asking.
do
you
have
any
evidence
about
one
way
or
another,
as
to
whether
or
not
it
has
prevented
admissions
or
confessions
that
otherwise
might
have
been
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
miranda
was
a
prophylactic
one
to
perhaps
act
as
a
deterrent
to
the
kind
of
interrogations
that
shouldn’t
take
place
and
to
stop
the
interrogation
if
the
witness,
if
the
defendant
who’s
in
custody
doesn’t
want
to
talk,
that’s
the
purpose
of
miranda.
then,
i
suppose
that
purpose
is
substantially
implemented
if
you
say
that
you
may
not
interrogate
him
about
other
evidence
even
though
you
never
intend
introduce
his
statements.
i
suppose
if
you
prevail
here,
the
officers
may
continue
to
interrogate
the
defendant
in
custody
as
long
as
their
purpose
is
to
build
their
case
through
independent
evidence
whereas
to
evidence
that
he
leads
them
to.
so,
that
would
be
certainly
quite
a
motive
to
continue
to
interrogate.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
win
this
case,
i
take
it
the
one
way
of
putting
it
is
that
there’s
nothing
wrong
with
continuing
to
interrogate
to
attempt
get
leads
to
other
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
because
they
go
ahead
that
the
police
continued
to
interrogate
and
they
say,
“where’s
the
gun”
or
“where
were
you
at
a
certain
time”
and
he
finally
gives
an
answer
and
says,
“well,
i
was
with
henderson.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
would
say
that
was
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know,
they
won’t
be
able
to
use
a
confession
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
--
and
as
they
quit
interrogating,
he
certainly
isn’t
going
to
give
one.
so,
they
still
have
a
motive
to
seek
other
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
you
have
miranda
would
