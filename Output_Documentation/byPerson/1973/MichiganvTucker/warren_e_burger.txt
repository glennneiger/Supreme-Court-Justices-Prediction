e.

we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-482,
michigan
against
tucker.
mr.
patterson,
you
may
proceed
when
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
had
decide,
however,
that
the
exclusionary
aspect
does
not
apply
to
live
human
beings
who
are
ready
and
able
and
willing
to
come
in
and
testify
then,
we
don’t
need
to
render
these
problems
about
retroactivity,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
we
would
have
heard
of
them
by
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
patterson,
that
point
that
you’ve
made,
suppose
the
police
had
found
that
henderson
would
exculpate
the
defendant
here
and
they
had
not
produced
him
as
a
witness,
it'd
be
in
violation
of
brady
and
other
cases,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
rights,
you
mean
warning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
if
the
court
should
decide
that
the
exclusionary
doctrine
cannot
apply
to
a
live
human
being
who
is
ready,
able
and
willing
to
testify
then
we
don’t
reach
all
these
nuances,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
korman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
one
o’clock.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
korman,
you
have
about,
i’m
not
sure
just
how
much
time
they’ve
probably
advised
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
petition
has
been
filed,
has
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
korman.
mr.
mogill.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
page
is
that
you
are
talking
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
the,
a
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
isn’t
completely
at
parallel,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
then
make
a
distinction
between
witnesses
who
appeared
voluntarily
and
those
who
appeared
under
subpoena,
under
the
compulsion
of
a
subpoena?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
wondered
then
why
--
what
--
i
was
waiting
for
the
point
that
you
were
going
to
make
as
to
the
distinction
between
the
two.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
includes
entirely
the
possibility
that
it
as
with
--
as
happens
in
many
cases
that
witnesses
volunteer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
point
is
the
defense
is
purely
speculative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’ve
got
into
some
hypothetical
analogy.
so,
let
me
ask
you
another
one
that
based
partly
on
this
case.
suppose
that
henderson,
when
the
police
went
to
him,
did
what
the
defendant
hoped
he
would
and
said
oh!
yes
he
was
with
me
and
but
not
resenting
that,
the
prosecution
went
forward
on
other
evidence
and
then
he
was
called
his
an
alibi
witness
by
the
defendants
and
testified
affirmatively
in
favor
of
the
defendant’s
theory
that
he
was
somewhere
else
at
the
time.
but
then
on
cross
examination,
a
vigorous
cross
examination
as
it
sometimes
does,
brought
out
the
fact
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth,
and
then
he
told
all
the
things
which
he
testified
to
in
this
case.
would
you
says
that
that
cross
examination
must
be
stricken,
he
must
not
be
permitted
to
testify?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
that
the
cross
examination
could
come
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
make
another
variation
in
the
hypothetical
and
the
question
i'll
put
you
on
this
hypothetical
is,
would
you
extend
the
rule
that
you
are
not
contending
forward
to
this
situations,
suppose
a
kidnapping
case,
a
kind
that
has
been
mentioned
before
occurs
and
the
police
have
some
word
that
the
kidnapped
victim
maybe
in
a
particular
house,
group
of
buildings,
and
they
go
to
the
house
without
a
warrant.
they
break
into
the
house,
find
the
kidnapped
victim
and
perhaps
one
of
the
kidnappers.
would
you
say
the
testimony
of
the
kidnapped
victim
must
then
be
excluded
and
suppressed
because
of
the
illegal
entry
and
break
in
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
assuming
and
i
think
that
my
hypothesis
that
the
police
conduct
was
illegal,
but
they
finally
got
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
admissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
she
would
not
be
able,
she
or
he
would
not
be
able
to
testify
that
just
this
man
and
this
man
are
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
withstanding
the
illegal
manner
in
which
the
witness
was
found?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
those
things
are
traditionally
reached
by
cross
examination,
in
motion
by
us
additives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
were
linking
up
the
attitudnal
factor
with
the
ultimate
risk
of
letting
this
person
testify?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
try
the
cases
that
have
held
that
it
was
unworkable
or
it
is
that,
are
you
expressing
your
own
analysis
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
excluder
admits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gribbs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
quite
sure,
which
one
do
you
say
is
the
only
addition
of
miranda?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fourth
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apparently,
what
you’re
talking
about,
mr.
gribbs,
affects
this
defendant's
giving
the
name
of
the
alibi
witness.
do
you
suggest
he
did
that
because
he
was
overpowered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
speaking
of
the
generality
of
cases,
not
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
is
not
vital,
don’t
you
think
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
patterson,
you
have
about
six
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thus,
you’re
still
making
the
distinction
i
take
it
between
the
interrogation
that
produces
a
pistol
as
justice
white
suggested
and
the
interrogation
that
leads
to
finding
a
witness
who
then
comes
into
the
courtroom
to
testify
under
oath?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mogill,
you
appeared
by
the
court’s
appointment
in
this
case
and
on
