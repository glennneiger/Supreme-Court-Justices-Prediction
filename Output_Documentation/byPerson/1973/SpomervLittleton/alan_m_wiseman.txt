mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
name
peyton
berbling
as
the
defendant
in
our
complaint.
he
was
the
--
then
state's
attorney.
his
term
of
office
ended
december
4
of
1972
which
was
after
the
seventh
circuit
decision.
mr.
spomer,
on
his
own,
substituted
himself
as
a
defendant
in
this
case
in
so
far
as
the
appeal
is
concerned.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
is
--
well,
it
is
in
mr.
spomer's
brief
your
honor
where
he
specifically
said
that
he
substituted
himself
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
other
than
that,
no
your
honor.
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
when
mr.
berbling’s
term
of
office
ended
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
i
think
mr.
spomer
is
conceding
that
fact
and
i
think
that
the
court
can
take
note
of
that.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
your
honor
the
normal
procedure
would
be
that
we
were
to
substituted
the
other
side
as
a
party.
we
do
not
do
that.
i
would
suggest
that
the
case
has
not
necessarily
have
to
be
deemed
moot
in
so
far
as
the
states
of
attorney
is
concerned,
if
the
court
chooses
to
for
two
possible
reasons.
one,
mr.
spomer
substituted
himself
and
he
is
apparently
conceding
that
he
is
continuing
the
practices
of
mr.
berbling.
the
second
is
that
an
investigator
employed
in
the
state’s
attorney’s
office,
a
man
by
the
name
of
mr.
shepherd
is
still
employed
by
the
state’s
attorney’s
office.
his
--
mr.
shepherd’s
petition
is
pending
before
this
court
in
conjunction
with
the
petition
of
the
previous
state’s
attorney.
and
it
could
be
stated
that
mr.
shepherd’s
conduct
is
continuing
and
mr.
spomer
as
his
supervisor
who
has
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
his
subordinates
is
therefore
a
proper
party
at
this
time.
i
would
submit
however
that
in
order
for
us
to
proceed
against
mr.
spomer,
it
would
be
necessary
for
us
to
investigate
the
facts
to
see
that
the
concession
apparently
made
by
the
state’s
attorney
is
true
and
demand
our
complaint.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
at
that
--
all
those
facts
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
the
only
difference
that
i
see
is,
one,
that
the
state’s
attorney
has
made
this
concession
and
two,
that
if
a
subordinate
whom
we
are
charging
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
is
only
in
the
record
of
this
argument
by
the
counsel
for
the
state’s
attorney.
aside
from
the
issue
of
whether
it
is
moot
against
the
state’s
attorney,
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
in
that
--
that
is
in
the
record
in
this
way
that
we
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
he
is
employed
by
the
state’s
attorney
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
has
terminated
his
employment
and
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
to
a
certain
degree,
it
is
your
honor
but
since
we
are
seeking
the
equitable
relief,
a
superior
is
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
his
subordinates
and
whether
it’s
by
acquiescence
or
active
participation
in
the
conduct
of
the
subordinate.
he
would
have
a
duty,
i
believe
to
stop
that
conduct
and
precedent
for
this
is
a
--
that
i’m
familiar
within
a
seventh
circuit
decision
is
schnell
versus
city
of
chicago
in
which
the
superintendent
of
police
was
named
as
a
defendant
in
that
case
solely
because
he
was
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
his
subordinates.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
frankly
i’m
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
--
we
are
not
seeking
relief
that
extensive.
what
we
are
seeking
is,
one,
that
the
state’s
attorney
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
complaints
of
blacks
simply
because
they’re
black.
he
refuses
simply
to
take
the
evidence
of
a
black
complainant.
second,
he
is
refusing
to
prosecute
whites
when
the
victims
are
black
simply
because
the
victim
is
black.
what
we’re
seeking
is
a
prohibitory
injunction
to
keep
him
from
using
race
as
a
criterion
in
the
exercise
of
his
office.
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
has
suggested
so
far
that
a
reporting
system
indicating
the
disposition
of
cases
is
--
might
be
a
start.
it
would
be
for
the
district
court
after
hearing
again
the
case
in
a
trial
in
a
way
in
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
the
parties
to
then
determine
what
would
be
appropriate
relief
at
the
first
instance.
we
would
assume
that
a
--
once
a
federal
court
issued
an
order
compelling
the
state’s
attorney
not
to
use
race
as
a
factor
in
the
exercise
of
his
office
that
the
state’s
attorney
will
abide
by
that
order.
it
is
only
if
he
disobeys
that
order
that
further
relief
comes
in
to
being.
the
situation
in
cairo
is
that
as
a
result
of
the
efforts
of
blacks
to
free
themselves
of
the
shackles
of
the
discriminatory
conduct
of
the
white
merchants
and
public
officials
that
they
have
been
the
targets
of
white
criminal
conduct,
assaults
and
batteries
occur
frequently
in
the
course
of
their
peaceful
parading
to
demonstrate
against
this.
they
are
assaulted
and
battered
by
whites.
and
what
happens?
they
then
complain
to
the
state’s
attorney.
and
what
does
he
do?
he
refuses
to
take
any
evidence.
he
refuses
to
investigate.
we
brought
this
action
under
1981.
in
1981
specifically
says
all
persons
shall
have
the
same
right
to
give
evidence
and
to
the
full
and
equal
benefit
of
all
laws
and
proceedings
for
the
security
of
persons
as
white
persons.
that
is
precisely
what
we’re
charging
that
the
state’s
attorney
has
violated
that
he
is
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
and
that
he
refuses
to
do
what
the
federal
statute
requires
and
that
is
for
him
to
give
all
persons
the
same
right
to
give
evidence
as
white
persons.
he
is
refusing
to
allow
them
to
give
evidence
although
he
allows
white
persons
to
give
evidence
when
they
are
the
victims
of
black
criminal
conduct.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
to
my
knowledge,
the
state’s
attorney
is
an
independent
office
and
to
my
knowledge
he
is
not
subjected
to
the
control
of
the
governor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
i
think
that
in
this
case
your
honor,
the
blacks
who
have
sued
are
complaining
not
only
that
the
law
isn’t
being
enforced
but
that
this
state’s
attorney
that
is
really
the
predecessor
state’s
attorney
would
refuse
to
take
evidence
or
investigate.
in
that
sense,
the
state’s
attorney's
conduct
(voice
overlap).
that
the
same
--
that
that
proposes
the
same
question
as
was
dealt
with
last
term?
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
i
submit
your
honor
that
because
this
is
a
pattern
in
practice
case
in
which
the
conduct
of
the
state’s
attorney
in
refusing
to
take
evidence
of
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
i
suggest
your
honor
at
least
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
we
have
stated
the
necessary
allegations
for
a
claim
under
sections
1981
and
1983.
i
think
that
the
question
may
be
then
that
the
extent
whether
this
court
or
federal
district
court
should
restrain
itself
from
exercising
the
authority
that
is
present
under
the
civil
rights
statutes
and
i
think
first
we
have
to
start
with
the
proposition
that
this
court
has
in
the
past
decided
a
number
of
cases
in
which
it
has
enjoined
pending
state
prosecutions.
i
suggest
that
the
standards
that
have
been
established
in
those
cases
in
which
the
office
of
the
state
has
been
exercising
bad
faith
and
in
which
there
was
immediate
irreparable
harm
have
been
met
in
this
case.
i
think
the
doctrine
of
quasi-judicial
immunity
because
of
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
is
not,
it
has
already
that
resolved.
i
don’t
believe
this
case
--
the
interference
by
a
federal
court
by
issuing
such
an
injunction
will
infringe
upon
the
lawful
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
the
state’s
attorney.
first
of
all,
discretion
is
not
unlimited.
it
is
limited
to
abiding
by
the
law
and
not
to
stick
to
anull
the
constitution
in
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
this
is
not
an
isolated
case
in
which
we
have
a
disgruntled
litigant
complaining
that
he
did
not
have
his
attacker
or
assailant
prosecuted.
instead,
we
are
claiming
that
across
the
board,
black
complainants
do
not
get
relief.
it
does
not
involve
discretion
at
all
when
the
state’s
attorney
says
i’m
not
going
to
take
evidence
of
--
from
blacks
when
they
are
victims
of
white
criminal
conduct.
it
will
moreover,
when
the
judege
--
when
the
state’s
attorney
refuses
to
prosecute
simply
because
the
victim
is
black
does
not
involve
discretion
at
all
either.
there
is
no
relief
in
the
state
courts
in
this
situation
where
the
state’s
attorney
refuses
to
take
evidence.
you
cannot
appeal
to
a
state
court
for
relief.
where
the
state’s
attorney
refuses
to
investigate
or
refuses
to
prosecute,
you
cannot
go
to
a
state
court
for
relief.
the
--
one
suggestion
that
mr.
spomer
has
made
in
his
brief
is
interestingly
it
odds
in
the
petition
of
mr.
berbling.
mr.
spomer
suggesting
that
a
cause
of
action
in
damages
is
preferable
to
equitable
relief.
mr.
berbling
of
course
is
taking
the
opposite
position
in
his
petition
before
the
court.
i
would
suggest
that
damages
would
not
be
--
would
not
solve
the
problem
because
it
would
not
prevent
the
ongoing
discrimination.
what
you
could
have
in
a
situation
where
you
had
an
action
and
damages
is
that
the
white
citizens
who
are
against
the
black
--
efforts
to
free
themselves
collecting
the
defense
fund.
and
every
time
the
state’s
attorney
is
found
liable
in
damages,
they
pay
it
off
but
in
the
same
sense,
they
manage
to
maintain
their
supremacy.
they
manage
to
avoid
prosecution.
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
not
be
a
way
to
solve
this
problem.
the
basic
relief
that
we
are
seeking
is
on
a
prohibitory
nature
that
race
not
be
used
as
a
criterion
in
the
exercise
of
office.
i
think
again
that
it
would
be
premature
to
determine
what
precisely
is
the
appropriate
relief
because
i
think
the
district
court
must
hear
our
evidence
first
and
then
fashion
what
would
be
considered
appropriate
relief
by
it.
in
summary,
when
citizens
are
deprived
of
access
to
the
criminal
justice
system,
the
fabric
of
a
civilized
society
disintegrates
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
is
what
is
happening
in
cairo.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
precisely.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
name
peyton
berbling
as
the
defendant
in
our
complaint.
he
was
the
--
then
state's
attorney.
his
term
of
office
ended
december
4
of
1972
which
was
after
the
seventh

mr.

on

as

mr.

it

other
than

no

there
is
no

nothing
in

record
to

berbling’s
term
of
office
ended
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
i
think
mr.
spomer
is
conceding
that
fact
and
i
think
that
the
court
can
take
note
of
that.
mr.
alan
m.

well,
your

one,
mr.
spomer
substituted
himself
and
he
is
apparently
conceding
that
he
is
continuing
the
practices
of
mr.
berbling.
the
second
is
that
an

employed
in
the

attorney’s
office,
a
man
by
the

of

is

his

of
the
previous

and
it

once
a
federal
court
issued
an
order
compelling
the
state’s
attorney
not
to
use
race
as
a
factor
in
the
exercise
of
his
office
that
the
state’s
attorney
will
abide
by
that
order.
it
is
only
if
he
disobeys
that
order
that
further
relief
comes
in
to
being.
the
situation
in
cairo
is
that
as
a
result
of
the
efforts
of
blacks
to
free
themselves
of
the
shackles
of
the
discriminatory
conduct
of
the
white
merchants
and
public
officials
that
they
have
been
the
targets
of
white
criminal
conduct,
assaults
and
batteries
occur
frequently
in
the
course
of
their
peaceful
parading
to
demonstrate
against
this.
they
are
assaulted
and
battered
by
whites.
and
what
happens?
they
then
complain
to
the
state’s
attorney.
and
what
does
he
do?
he
refuses
to
take
any
evidence.
he
refuses
to
investigate.
we
brought
this
action
under
1981.
in
1981
specifically
says
all
persons
shall
have
the
same
right
to
give
evidence
and
to
the
full
and
equal
benefit
of
all
laws
and
proceedings
for
the
security
of
persons
as
white
persons.
that
is
precisely
what
we’re
charging
that
the
state’s
attorney
has
violated
that
he
is
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
and
that
he
refuses
to
do
what
the
federal
statute
requires
and
that
is
for
him
to
give
all
persons
the
same
right
to
give
evidence
as
white
persons.
he
is
refusing
to
allow
them
to
give
evidence
although
he
allows
white
persons
to
give
evidence
when
they
are
the
victims
of
black
criminal
conduct.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
to
my
knowledge,
the
state’s
attorney
is
an
independent
office
and
to
my
knowledge
he
is
not
subjected
to
the
control
of
the
governor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
i
think
that
in
this
case
your
honor,
the
blacks
who
have
sued
are
complaining
not
only
that
the
law
isn’t
being
enforced
but
that
this
state’s
attorney
that
is
really
the
predecessor
state’s
attorney
would
refuse
to
take
evidence
or
investigate.
in
that
sense,
the
state’s
attorney's
conduct
(voice
overlap).
that
the
same
--
that
that
proposes
the
same
question
as
was
dealt
with
last
term?
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
i
submit
your
honor
that
because
this
is
a
pattern
in
practice
case
in
which
the
conduct
of
the
state’s
attorney
in
refusing
to
take
evidence
of
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
i
suggest
your
honor
at
least
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
we
have
stated
the
necessary
allegations
for
a
claim
under
sections
1981
and
1983.
i
think
that
the
question
may
be
then
that
the
extent
whether
this
court
or
federal
district
court
should
restrain
itself
from
exercising
the
authority
that
is
present
under
the
civil
rights
statutes
and
i
think
first
we
have
to
start
with
the
proposition
that
this
court
has
in
the
past
decided
a
number
of
cases
in
which
it
has
enjoined
pending
state
prosecutions.
i
suggest
that
the
standards
that
have
been
established
in
those
cases
in
which
the
office
of
the
state
has
been
exercising
bad
faith
and
in
which
there
was
immediate
irreparable
harm
have
been
met
in
this
case.
i
think
the
doctrine
of
quasi-judicial
immunity
because
of
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
is
not,
it
has
already
that
resolved.
i
don’t
believe
this
case
--
the
interference
by
a
federal
court
by
issuing
such
an
injunction
will
infringe
upon
the
lawful
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
the
state’s
attorney.
first
of
all,
discretion
is
not
unlimited.
it
is
limited
to
abiding
by
the
law
and
not
to
stick
to
anull
the
constitution
in
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
this
is
not
an
isolated
case
in
which
we
have
a
disgruntled
litigant
complaining
that
he
did
not
have
his
attacker
or
assailant
prosecuted.
instead,
we
are
claiming
that
across
the
board,
black
complainants
do
not
get
relief.
it
does
not
involve
discretion
at
all
when
the
state’s
attorney
says
i’m
not
going
to
take
evidence
of
--
from
blacks
when
they
are
victims
of
white
criminal
conduct.
it
will
moreover,
when
the
judege
--
when
the
state’s
attorney
refuses
to
prosecute
simply
because
the
victim
is
black
does
not
involve
discretion
at
all
either.
there
is
no
relief
in
the
state
courts
in
this
situation
where
the
state’s
attorney
refuses
to
take
evidence.
you
cannot
appeal
to
a
state
court
for
relief.
where
the
state’s
attorney
refuses
to
investigate
or
refuses
to
prosecute,
you
cannot
go
to
a
state
court
for
relief.
the
--
one
suggestion
that
mr.
spomer
has
made
in
his
brief
is
interestingly
it
odds
in
the
petition
of
mr.
berbling.
mr.
spomer
suggesting
that
a
cause
of
action
in
damages
is
preferable
to
equitable
relief.
mr.
berbling
of
course
is
taking
the
opposite
position
in
his
petition
before
the
court.
i
would
suggest
that
damages
would
not
be
--
would
not
solve
the
problem
because
it
would
not
prevent
the
ongoing
discrimination.
what
you
could
have
in
a
situation
where
you
had
an
action
and
damages
is
that
the
white
citizens
who
are
against
the
black
--
efforts
to
free
themselves
collecting
the
defense
fund.
and
every
time
the
state’s
attorney
is
found
liable
in
damages,
they
pay
it
off
but
in
the
same
sense,
they
manage
to
maintain
their
supremacy.
they
manage
to
avoid
prosecution.
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
not
be
a
way
to
solve
this
problem.
the
basic
relief
that
we
are
seeking
is
on
a
prohibitory
nature
that
race
not
be
used
as
a
criterion
in
the
exercise
of
office.
i
think
again
that
it
would
be
premature
to
determine
what
precisely
is
the
appropriate
relief
because
i
think
the
district
court
must
hear
our
evidence
first
and
then
fashion
what
would
be
considered
appropriate
relief
by
it.
in
summary,
when
citizens
are
deprived
of
access
to
the
criminal
justice
system,
the
fabric
of
a
civilized
society
disintegrates
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
is
what
is
happening
in
cairo.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
precisely.
