mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is,
as
it
was
referred
to
in
the
previous
argument
the
next
case
involving
the
state's
attorney
if
it
would
help
the
court,
i
will
give
a
brief
outline
of
the
standing
of
the
various
parts
of
the
seventh
circuit
judgment
and
the
appeals
taken
there
from.
seventh
circuit
indicated
that
there
would
be
equitable
relief
available
if
the
case
were
proven
against
the
two
state
judges.
that
part
of
the
seventh
circuit
appeal
is
the
subject
to
the
previous
case.
the
seventh
circuit
also
indicated
that
there
would
be
mandatory
injunctive
relief
available
against
the
state's
attorney
of
alexander
county
and
that
part
of
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
is
the
concern
of
this
case.
there
is
a
third
petition
for
certiorari
filed
on
behalf
of
peyton
berbling,
the
immediate
past
state's
attorney
of
alexander
county
and
his
investigator
earl
shepherd
and
the
police
chief
of
cairo,
illinois,
chief
meisenheimer.
that
petition
concerns
the
portion
of
the
judgment
having
to
do
to
the
extent
that
it
does
with
injunctions
against
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
is
pending.
the
petition
has
not
been
ruled
upon.
it
--
that
concerns
whatever
remains
of
the
injunction
with
respect
to
berbling
and
i
suspect
nothing
remains.
whatever
remains
of
the
injunction
with
respect
to
shepherd
and
meisenheimer
but
principally
the
third
case
is
concerned
with
the
damage,
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit.
the
only
two
cases
that
are
before
this
court
in
terms
of
certiorari
having
been
granted
have
to
do
with
the
injunctive
relief.
now
the
question
has
been
raise
during
the
course
of
the
previous
oral
argument
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
state's
attorney
spomer
was
not
named
as
an
original
defendant
in
this
case
and
that
there
are
no
specific
factual
allegations
against
him.
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
spomer
does
not
raise
that
argument
and
it
was
a
decision
by
mr.
spomer
consistent
with
my
advice
to
him
that
whatever
defense
he
would
have
and
whatever
claim
he
would
have
with
respect
to
the
correctness
of
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
carryover
of
the
allegations
of
berbling
to
allegations
against
spomer
that
he
should
not
and
he
is
so
decided
that
he
should
not
raise
that
point.
the
waiver
that
we
make
with
respect
to
any
claim
that
the
allegations
with
respect
to
berbling
do
not
carryover
to
spomer
may
give
this
court
an
indication
of
how
significant
the
basic
underlying
issue
is
both
to
the
state's
attorney
of
alexander
county
and
to
state
prosecutors
generally
in
this
country.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
problem.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
there
is
a
sufficient
case
of
controversy.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
there
is
a
sufficient
statutory
claim
against
the
office
of
the
state's
attorney
of
alexander
county.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
not.
i
am
of
course
aware
of
the
fact
that
such
a
contention
can
be
made
and
it
certainly
an
arguable
one.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
oh!
no.
i
have
done
many
things
in
the
court
--
course
of
my
practice
before
courts
of
the
last
resort
but
words
of
binding
cannot
and
have
no
power
of
words
that
i
do
not
use.
this
court
can
despite
the
waiver
made
by
spomer
decide
that
there
exist
no
case
or
controversy.
i
suggest
that
there
are
very
sound
reasons
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
there
is
--
the
complaint
is
specific
with
respect
to
those
actions
that
took
place
while
berbling
was
the
state's
attorney.
not
all
of
the
actions
or
not
all
the
specific
allegations
have
to
do
with
berbling
himself.
some
of
them
have
to
do
with
the
staff
in
his
office.
it
is
true
that
in
each
of
the
allegations
that
berbling's
name
is
mentioned.
there
are
two
things
that
ought
to
be
pointed
out
to
the
court.
the
first
is
that
there
has
been
no
allegation
or
no
claim
that
despite
the
fact
that
one
could
be
made
that
spomer,
the
state's
attorney
has
changed
any
of
the
policies
that
berbling
exercised
and
in
fact
there
is
the
affirmative
act
of
spomer
in
substituting
himself
for
berbling
in
this
court.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
one
in
the
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
yes.
i
can
see
that
point
but
i
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
what?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
think.
i
think
not.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
think
not.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice
?-
mr.
james
b.
zagel
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
return
to
the
point
that
we
have
departed
before,
so
far
as
i
can
tell
in
the
brief
period
of
time
that
i
have
had
to
review
materials
and
i
find
none,
i
find
almost
no
decided
cases
on
the
point.
the
only
indication
i
have
with
respect
to
substitution
of
parties
is
a
line
in
(inaudible)
on
supreme
court
practice
which
indicates
that
the
substitution
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
successor
will
continue
the
policy
which
was
responsible
for
the
litigation
and
that
if
that
policy
is
not
to
be
continued
it
is
the
burden
of
the
substituted
official
to
make
a
motion
and
to
prove
that
the
case
is
moot
and
i've
indicated
before
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
nor
there
--
will
there
be
on
the
part
of
my
client
to
indicate
that
he
would
change
the
policies
which
are
alleged
to
have
been
exercised
by
his
predecessor.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
my
client's
position
is
that
his
policy
would
not
deviate
from
the
policies
of
his
business.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
his
--
i
think
he
would
concede
that
he
would
do
the
acts
that
is
alleged
that
his
predecessor
states
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
felt
purposes
of
this
litigation,
in
some
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it's
my
--
to
answer
that
question
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
which
i'm
willing
to
do
but
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
if
the
allegation
is
?-
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
if
they
do
constitute
a
crime
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
one
of
the
points
that
was
made,
one
of
the
points
so
suggested
is
that
if
the
allegations
of
the
client
are
true,
one
of
the
appropriate
remedies
for
the
plaintiffs
below
who
wants
to
seek
federal
prosecution
of
the
state's
attorney.
that
is
one
of
the
alternative
remedies
and
if
the
policies
that
are
being
followed
by
this
state's
attorney
and
by
his
successor
constitute
federal
crimes
then
there
should
be
federal
prosecution.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
it
is.
it
is
necessary
not
only
to
preserve
the
litigation
generally
for
the
larger
issue.
i
rather
suspect
that
the
policies
followed
in
--
by
berbling
and
stripping
of
the
general
conclusory
allegations.
the
policy
is
followed
by
berbling
with
as
a
practical
necessity
be
followed
by
spomer.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
the
successor
comes
on
limit
so
long
as
the
successor.
well
--
my
answer
(voice
overlap)
he
couldn't
possibly
have
done
anything
alleged
because
he
wasn't
in
office.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
my
answer
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
my
answer
is
really
is
twofold.
the
first
part
of
the
answer,
these
are
basic
contention.
that
these
allegations
if
stated
against
spomer
directly
instead
of
had
to
continued
an
office,
if
berbling
continued
an
office
would
not
state
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
in
any
of
them.
it
--
it's
a
secondary
position
not
to
the
extent
that
they
do
are
found
to
state
an
action.
that
they
would
state
an
action
against
the
successor
in
office,
the
substitute
party
so
long
as
there
is
no
declaration
and
the
burden
is
upon
him
to
make
a
declaration.
that
he
is
going
to
deviate
from
those
policies.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
so,
yes,
that
would
be
a
status
although
i
tend
to
think
that
there
has
been
no
material
change.
so
far
as
i'm
aware
in
alexander
county
since
december
when
spomer
took
over.
it
might
also
be
said
that
the
seventh
circuit
that
at
the
time
the
ruling
was
issued
it
should
have
been
apparent
to
the
seventh
circuit
that
berbling
would
not
be
an
office
after
december
5
because
he
did
not
run
for
re-election.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
so.
i
think
so.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
yes,
although
it
could
be
the
term
at
the
time
they
issued
that
opinion
that
the
berbling
would
not
succeed
himself
in
office.
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
succeed
himself
an
office
simply
because
he
had
not
filed
for
re-election
in
the
filing
date
is
in
--
was
the
previous
december.
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
there
has
been
some
discussion
as
to
whether
the
argument
that
is
offered
here
and
i
suppose
with
respect
to
both
petitioners,
this
one
and
the
one
in
the
previous
cases
whether
the
argument
is
one
of
immunity
or
one
of
scope
of
remedy.
for
purposes
of
this
petitioner,
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference.
how
you
view
it
simply
because
whether
you
view
it
as
an
immunity
argument
or
as
a
scope
of
the
remedy
argument
that
position
of
the
petitioner
--
state's
attorney
is
taking
is
that
this
kind
of
remedy,
this
mandatory
injunction
could
under
no
circumstances
in
any
case
ever
be
appropriately
issued.
so
whether
the
argument
is
phrased
in
terms
of
scope
of
the
remedy
or
absolute
immunity,
its
functional
purpose
from
our
view
is
precisely
the
same.
i
might
add
also
that
although
i
think
that
--
and
i
agree
with
the
position
of
the
petition
the
previous
case,
with
respect
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy
directed
against
the
judges,
i
would
submit
that
the
argument
of
the
states
attorney
is
still
stronger
than
that
of
the
judges.
essentially,
what
the
seventh
circuit
would
force
the
united
states
district
judge
to
do
is
to
exercise
a
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
both
a
trial
judge
and
the
state
prosecutor.
i
think
it
is
improper
that
it
does
either
but
i
might
say
that
at
least
when
it
comes
to
exercising
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
the
state
trial
judge
the
united
states
district
judges
doing
something
that
is
not
too
far
remote
from
what
he
is
expected
to
do
with
his
own
docket.
because
the
federal
trial
judge
of
course
makes
decisions
as
to
bail
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
when
it
comes
to
exercising
supervisory,
excuse
me,
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
the
state's
attorney,
the
court
is
crossing
into
the
realm
of
prosecutor.
and
i
think
for
reasons
that
we
have
stated
innumerable
times
in
our
briefs
it
is
the
function
that
cannot
be
effectively
performed
by
most
judges
and
for
those
few
judges
who
could
effectively
perform
it.
it
would
be
highly
inappropriate
to
do
so.
i
might
add
also,
that
the
reason
that
this
ruling
is
so
particularly
crucial
for
prosecutors
throughout
the
nation
is
that
there
is
aside
from
situations
like
those
in
cairo,
illinois.
there
is
in
this
country
a
large
number
of
groups
of
people
who
have
severe
quarrels
with
the
way
criminal
justices
run
whose
quarrels
generally
fall
on
the
side
of
their
viewed
insufficient
prosecution.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
a
very
realistic
possibility
that
if
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit,
this
remedy
is
allowed
to
stand
that
we
will
open
a
real
pandora's
box
with
respect
to
suits
against
prosecutors.
now,
the
pandora's
box
argument
is
a
common
one
i
think
that
at
least
half
the
litigants
who
argued
cases
involving
basic
principles
of
law
will
use
a
variation
of
the
pandora's
box
argument
saying
if
you
do
this
then
the
walls
will
all
fall
down.
and
perhaps
there
is
a
hyperbole
in
that
argument
in
most
cases.
i
think
not
in
the
case
of
the
prosecutor.
there
is
presently
in
the
state
of
illinois,
at
least
several
groups,
who
are
complaining
vigorously
that
although
they
have
not
sued
yet
about
what
they
consider
to
be
insufficient
efforts
by
the
prosecutors
not
to
proceed
in
given
cases.
the
most
prominent
of
which
in
our
state
is
the
citizens
for
decent
literature
who
are
complaining
bitterly
about
the
failure
of
various
prosecutors
to
move
against
literature
they
consider
obscene.
there
is
a
group
of
people
who
claim
to
represent
rape
victims
who
are
concerned
about
the
policies
of
prosecution
with
respect
to
rape
cases.
there
are
groups
that
complain
about
the
prosecutions
with
respect
to
environmental
cases.
and
i
suspect
that
if
the
ruling
stands
up
most
prosecutors
who
have
adopted
a
policy
of
declining
of
anything.
any
violation
of
criminal
statues
involving
in
dispute
between
a
tenant
and
a
landlord,
i
suspect
that
both
the
tenants
and
the
landlords
will
be
in
federal
court
claiming
improper
prosecution.
and
i
might
add
further
that
purely
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
judge
could
administer
this
rather
a
mammoth
remedy
that
is
called
for.
there
is
the
--
the
basic
question
and
i
suppose
this
is
an
argument
that
speaks
more
to
an
immunity
argument
than
to
anything
else.
there
is
the
basic
question
of
forcing
the
prosecutor
to
spend
his
time
in
court
and
defend
his
policies
with
respect
to
discretionary
declamations
of
prosecutions.
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
i
don't
think
any
prosecutor
that
could
long
function
if
he
had
to
depose
on
declamations
of
prosecution.
i
doubt
that
there
is
a
prosecutor
in
this
nation
who
prosecutes
more
than
a
fraction
less
than
one-half.
certainly,
more
than
a
fraction
of
the
cases
that
are
brought
to
him
--
would
he
have
to
come
to
federal
court
and
explain
this
declamation
in
each
and
every
one
of
these
cases?
even
if
the
case
is
not
made,
even
if
the
petitioner
fails
to
make
his
case
so
the
plaintiffs
fail
to
make
their
case.
the
enormous
burden
on
the
prosecutor,
i
think
would
be
a
sufficient
to
justify,
as
it
does
in
other
areas,
the
application
of
an
absolute
immunity
doctrine.
and
it
is
clear
i
might
say.
it
is
clear
that
the
seventh
circuit
contemplated
that
the
federal
district
court
would
address
itself
to
individual
decisions.
there
is
a
certain
selective
blindness
exercised
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
with
respect
to
what
exactly
they
won
if
you
want
to
use
that
word
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
i
quote
from
the
language
on
the
--
of
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
that
said,
"an
initial
decree
might
set
out
the
general
tone
of
rights
to
be
protected
and
require
only
periodic
reports
of
various
types
of
aggregate
data
on
actions
on
bail
and
sentencing
and
disposition
of
complaints."
the
court
expressed
and
i
quote,
"complete
confidence
in
the
district
court's
ability
to
set
up
further
guides
is
required
and
if
necessary
to
consider
individual
decisions"
which
appears
at
page
415
of
468
f.2d.
so
we
are
in
effect
talking
about
review
of
individual
decisions
to
or
not
to
prosecute.
there
has
been
citation
of
authority
in
this
court
in
which
federal
courts
have
exercised
what
might
be
called
a
pretrial
supervision
over
state
prosecutor
by
enjoining
him
from
proceeding
in
a
particular
case.
i
state
as
we
have
stated
in
the
briefs
that
this
is
a
far
different
thing
from
exercising
a
general
power
to
force
the
prosecutor
to
prosecute
a
case
in
a
certain
way
and
i
might
add
that
the
complaint
was
not
limited
simply
to
the
initiation
of
criminal
proceedings.
there
were
elements
in
the
complaint
that
said
that
the
prosecutor
didn't
present
the
case
competently.
perhaps,
the
closing
argument
didn't
appeal
to
the
plaintiffs.
or
perhaps
the
way
a
witness
was
examined
didn't
appeal
to
the
plaintiffs.
you're
talking
about
very
detailed
regulation
of
the
way
a
prosecutor
tries
his
case
and
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit.
and
certainly
what
the
plaintiffs
contemplate.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
those
cases
in
which
preliminary
injunctions
have
been
granted
prior
to
trial
or
at
least
that
has
been
suggested
that
it
might
be
done
are
really
no
different
in
effect
than
a
form
of
accelerated
appellant
review.
so
the
court
saying
in
advance
that
this
prosecution,
this
particular
prosecution
is
brought
in
such
bad
faith
or
for
such
obvious
harassment
purposes
that
we're
going
to
stop
it
now.
and
the
basic
premise
is
that
if
we
did
not
stop
it
now,
we
would
just
have
to
reverse
it
later.
but
it
is
still
a
review
of
an
individual
case.
as
i
suggest
in
the
brief,
there
are
available
and
i
think
superior
remedies,
superior
to
that
suggested
by
the
seventh
circuit.
indeed,
i
would
say
that
each
of
the
remedies
considered
by
the
seventh
circuit
including
the
most
draconian
one
of
all
which
is
to
say
reversal
of
convictions
of
people
who
were
properly
prosecuted
because
the
prosecutor
refuses
to
proceed
against
other
people.
i
think
that
even
that
remedy
is
preferable
to
the
remedy
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
was
take
upon
itself
or
if
not
take
upon
itself
convey
a
power
to
the
federal
district
judges
that
no
court
should
under
any
conditions
ever
exercise
and
that
is
the
power
to
prosecute.
the
federal
judge
simply
should
not
service
a
prosecute.
either
in
state
or
federal
court
and
i
think
that
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
amounts
to
as
a
command
to
the
federal
judge
that
if
certain
cases
are
proven.
you
have
to
preempt
the
decision
of
the
prosecutor
in
state
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
have
--
mr.
zagel
before
you
get
started,
if
by
any
chance
you
lose
this
case,
are
you
going
to
pay
the
cost?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
(inaudible)
who
is
going
to
pay
the
cost?
yes,
my
client
can
pay
the
cost?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
is
the
customary
rule
on
this
(inaudible).
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
of
spomer?
yes,
he
is.
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
no,
that
would
be
the
natural
assumption
that
if
we
were
to
lose
the
case,
mr.
spomer
will
get
a
little
bit
of
from
the
clerk
of
the
court
for
the
cost
then
he
would
pay
it.
with
respect
to
the
point
on
substitution,
i
just
point
out
the
rule
483
of
this
court
provides
for
automatic
substitution
in
these
cases.
one
point
that
was
made
by
mr.
wiseman
is
that,
and
it
generally
has
been
and
i
suppose
a
perfectly
acceptable
tactic
for
him
in
the
course
of
argument
as
to
--
is
to
minimize
although
i
don’t
think
he
can
do
so
successfully
what
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
seventh
circuit’s
remedy.
in
one
of
the
words
he
used
is
that
that
somewhere
will
have
to
start
and
this
is
just
the
start
at
determining
what
the
relief
has
to
be
granted.
it’s
really
not
the
start
that
so
much
concerns
us.
it’s
where
the
finish
is
and
no
one
has
denied
yet
and
no
one
has
ever
offered
a
credible
argument
that
the
limits
of
this
doctrine
are
very
broad
indeed
and
i
might
add
that
even
the
start
has
to
be
a
substantial
burden
on
any
prosecutor.
even
a
hearing
has
to
be
a
burden
on
the
prosecutor
and
the
discovery
practice
as
well.
that
too
is
a
burden
and
an
unreasonable
one.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
he
may.
he
may
violate
1981.
and
what
if
he
does
it
knowingly,
willfully
and
does
he
violate
242?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
he
may.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
if
you
view
it
again
solely
as
an
immunity
argument
rather
than
as
a
remedy
argument.
yes,
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
since
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
that
the
two
basic
points
are
these,
if
the
--
what
the
state’s
attorney
is
doing
constitutes
a
federal
crime
in
violation
of
242.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that’s
correct.
that
is
their
point.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
if
you
take
it
literally.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
that’s
precisely
my
point.
if
you
view
it
solely
as
an
immunity
matter,
no,
my
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
you
also
have
as
i
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
in
that
respect,
basically
i
supposed
my
argument
then
goes
--
to
that’s
the
scope
of
the
remedy
rather
than
immunity.
i
think
that
that
is
inherent
and
the
fact
that
i
have
made
to
concessions
which
considering
the
fact
that
this
brief
was
filed,
not
only
in
behalf
of
spomer
but
on
behalf
of
the
national
district
attorney’s
association
as
well.
i
think
a
very
substantial
concession
be,
if
the
that
there
would
be,
if
the
allegations
were
all
true,
remedy
and
federal
criminal
prosecution
which
i
think
is
perhaps
the
greatest
single
deterrence.
and
secondly,
we
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
if
there
has
to
be
any
remedy
at
all,
between
private
parties
in
a
federal
court
that
that
remedy
rather
than
be
the
injunction
be
damages.
i
tend
to
think
that
there
is
a
strong
immunity
argument
against
damages
as
well.
what
i
am
trying
to
impress
upon
the
court
is
the
degree
of
opposition
and
the
degree
perhaps
of
maybe
outright
terror
would
be
the
best
word
with
which
a
state
prosecutors
would
view
proceedings
under
the
seventh
circuits
opinion.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
there’s
one
final
question
i
would
answer
with
respect
to
the
governor’s
power.
the
governor
has
no
power
in
illinois
at
all
over
the
prosecutor
and
nor
does
the
attorney
general
except
to
nolle
prosequi
a
criminal
charge.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is,
as
it
was
referred
to
in
the
previous
argument
the
next
case
involving
the
state's
attorney
if
it
would
help
the
court,
i
will
give
a
brief
outline
of
the
standing
of
the
various
parts
of
the
seventh
circuit
judgment
and
the
appeals
taken
there
from.
seventh
circuit
indicated
that
there
would
be
equitable
relief
available
if
the
case
were
proven
against
the
two
state
judges.
that
part
of
the
seventh
circuit
appeal
is
the
subject
to
the
previous
case.
the
seventh
circuit
also
indicated
that
there
would
be
mandatory
injunctive
relief
available
against
the
state's
attorney
of
alexander
county
and
that
part
of
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
is
the
concern
of
this
case.
there
is
a
third
petition
for
certiorari
filed
on
behalf
of
peyton
berbling,
the
immediate
past
state's
attorney
of
alexander
county
and
his
investigator
earl
shepherd
and
the
police
chief
of
cairo,
illinois,
chief
meisenheimer.
that
petition
concerns
the
portion
of
the
judgment
having
to
do
to
the
extent
that
it
does
with
injunctions
against
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that
is
pending.
the
petition
has
not
been
ruled
upon.
it
--
that
concerns
whatever
remains
of
the
injunction
with
respect
to
berbling
and
i
suspect
nothing
remains.
whatever
remains
of
the
injunction
with
respect
to
shepherd
and
meisenheimer
but
principally
the
third
case
is
concerned
with
the
damage,
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit.
the
only
two
cases
that
are
before
this
court
in
terms
of
certiorari
having
been
granted
have
to
do
with
the
injunctive
relief.
now
the
question
has
been
raise
during
the
course
of
the
previous
oral
argument
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
state's
attorney
spomer
was
not
named
as
an
original
defendant
in
this
case
and
that
there
are
no
specific
factual
allegations
against
him.
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
spomer
does
not
raise
that
argument
and
it
was
a
decision
by
mr.
spomer
consistent
with
my
advice
to
him
that
whatever
defense
he
would
have
and
whatever
claim
he
would
have
with
respect
to
the
correctness
of
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
carryover
of
the
allegations
of
berbling
to
allegations
against
spomer
that
he
should
not
and
he
is
so
decided
that
he
should
not
raise
that
point.
the
waiver
that
we
make
with
respect
to
any
claim
that
the
allegations
with
respect
to
berbling
do
not
carryover
to
spomer
may
give
this
court
an
indication
of
how
significant
the
basic
underlying
issue
is
both
to
the
state's
attorney
of
alexander
county
and
to
state
prosecutors
generally
in
this
country.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
problem.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
there
is
a
sufficient
case
of
controversy.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
there
is
a
sufficient
statutory
claim
against
the
office
of
the
state's
attorney
of
alexander
county.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
not.
i
am
of
course
aware
of
the
fact
that
such
a
contention
can
be
made
and
it
certainly
an
arguable
one.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
oh!
no.
i
have
done
many
things
in
the
court
--
course
of
my
practice
before
courts
of
the
last
resort
but
words
of
binding
cannot
and
have
no
power
of
words
that
i
do
not
use.
this
court
can
despite
the
waiver
made
by
spomer
decide
that
there
exist
no
case
or
controversy.
i
suggest
that
there
are
very
sound
reasons
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
there
is
--
the
complaint
is
specific
with
respect
to
those
actions
that
took
place
while
berbling
was
the
state's
attorney.
not
all
of
the
actions
or
not
all
the
specific
allegations
have
to
do
with
berbling
himself.
some
of
them
have
to
do
with
the
staff
in
his
office.
it
is
true
that
in
each
of
the
allegations
that
berbling's
name
is
mentioned.
there
are
two
things
that
ought
to
be
pointed
out
to
the
court.
the
first
is
that
there
has
been
no
allegation
or
no
claim
that
despite
the
fact
that
one
could
be
made
that
spomer,
the
state's
attorney
has
changed
any
of
the
policies
that
berbling
exercised
and
in
fact
there
is
the
affirmative
act
of
spomer
in
substituting
himself
for
berbling
in
this
court.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
one
in
the
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
yes.
i
can
see
that
point
but
i
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
what?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
think.
i
think
not.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
i
think
not.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
mr.
chief
justice
?-
mr.
james
b.
zagel
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
return
to
the
point
that
we
have
departed
before,
so
far
as
i
can
tell
in
the
brief
period
of
time
that
i
have
had
to
review
materials
and
i
find
none,
i
find
almost
no
decided
cases
on
the
point.
the
only
indication
i
have
with
respect
to
substitution
of
parties
is
a
line
in
(inaudible)
on
supreme
court
practice
which
indicates
that
the
substitution
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
successor
will
continue
the
policy
which
was
responsible
for
the
litigation
and
that
if
that
policy
is
not
to
be
continued
it
is
the
burden
of
the
substituted
official
to
make
a
motion
and
to
prove
that
the
case
is
moot
and
i've
indicated
before
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
nor
there
--
will
there
be
on
the
part
of
my
client
to
indicate
that
he
would
change
the
policies
which
are
alleged
to
have
been
exercised
by
his
predecessor.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
that
my
client's
position
is
that
his
policy
would
not
deviate
from
the
policies
of
his
business.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
his
--
i
think
he
would
concede
that
he
would
do
the
acts
that
is
alleged
that
his
predecessor
states
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
felt
purposes
of
this
litigation,
in
some
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it's
my
--
to
answer
that
question
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
which
i'm
willing
to
do
but
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
if
the
allegation
is
?-
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
if
they
do
constitute
a
crime
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
one
of
the
points
that
was
made,
one
of
the
points
so
suggested
is
that
if
the
allegations
of
the
client
are
true,
one
of
the
appropriate
remedies
for
the
plaintiffs
below
who
wants
to
seek
federal
prosecution
of
the
state's
attorney.
that
is
one
of
the
alternative
remedies
and
if
the
policies
that
are
being
followed
by
this
state's
attorney
and
by
his
successor
constitute
federal
crimes
then
there
should
be
federal
prosecution.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
it
is.
it
is
necessary
not
only
to
preserve
the
litigation
generally
for
the
larger
issue.
i
rather
suspect
that
the
policies
followed
in
--
by
berbling
and
stripping
of
the
general
conclusory
allegations.
the
policy
is
followed
by
berbling
with
as
a
practical
necessity
be
followed
by
spomer.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
the
successor
comes
on
limit
so
long
as
the
successor.
well
--
my
answer
(voice
overlap)
he
couldn't
possibly
have
done
anything
alleged
because
he
wasn't
in
office.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
no,
my
answer
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
my
answer
is
really
is
twofold.
the
first
part
of
the
answer,
these
are
basic
contention.
that
these
allegations
if
stated
against
spomer
directly
instead
of
had
to
continued
an
office,
if
berbling
continued
an
office
would
not
state
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
in
any
of
them.
it
--
it's
a
secondary
position
not
to
the
extent
that
they
do
are
found
to
state
an
action.
that
they
would
state
an
action
against
the
successor
in
office,
the
substitute
party
so
long
as
there
is
no
declaration
and
the
burden
is
upon
him
to
make
a
declaration.
that
he
is
going
to
deviate
from
those
policies.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
so,
yes,
that
would
be
a
status
although
i
tend
to
think
that
there
has
been
no
material
change.
so
far
as
i'm
aware
in
alexander
county
since
december
when
spomer
took
over.
it
might
also
be
said
that
the
seventh
circuit
that
at
the
time
the
ruling
was
issued
it
should
have
been
apparent
to
the
seventh
circuit
that
berbling
would
not
be
an
office
after
december
5
because
he
did
not
run
for
re-election.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
think
so.
i
think
so.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
yes,
although
it
could
be
the
term
at
the
time
they
issued
that
opinion
that
the
berbling
would
not
succeed
himself
in
office.
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
succeed
himself
an
office
simply
because
he
had
not
filed
for
re-election
in
the
filing
date
is
in
--
was
the
previous
december.
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
there
has
been
some
discussion
as
to
whether
the
argument
that
is
offered
here
and
i
suppose
with
respect
to
both
petitioners,
this
one
and
the
one
in
the
previous
cases
whether
the
argument
is
one
of
immunity
or
one
of
scope
of
remedy.
for
purposes
of
this
petitioner,
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference.
how
you
view
it
simply
because
whether
you
view
it
as
an
immunity
argument
or
as
a
scope
of
the
remedy
argument
that
position
of
the
petitioner
--
state's
attorney
is
taking
is
that
this
kind
of
remedy,
this
mandatory
injunction
could
under
no
circumstances
in
any
case
ever
be
appropriately
issued.
so
whether
the
argument
is
phrased
in
terms
of
scope
of
the
remedy
or
absolute
immunity,
its
functional
purpose
from
our
view
is
precisely
the
same.
i
might
add
also
that
although
i
think
that
--
and
i
agree
with
the
position
of
the
petition
the
previous
case,
with
respect
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy
directed
against
the
judges,
i
would
submit
that
the
argument
of
the
states
attorney
is
still
stronger
than
that
of
the
judges.
essentially,
what
the
seventh
circuit
would
force
the
united
states
district
judge
to
do
is
to
exercise
a
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
both
a
trial
judge
and
the
state
prosecutor.
i
think
it
is
improper
that
it
does
either
but
i
might
say
that
at
least
when
it
comes
to
exercising
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
the
state
trial
judge
the
united
states
district
judges
doing
something
that
is
not
too
far
remote
from
what
he
is
expected
to
do
with
his
own
docket.
because
the
federal
trial
judge
of
course
makes
decisions
as
to
bail
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
when
it
comes
to
exercising
supervisory,
excuse
me,
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
the
state's
attorney,
the
court
is
crossing
into
the
realm
of
prosecutor.
and
i
think
for
reasons
that
we
have
stated
innumerable
times
in
our
briefs
it
is
the
function
that
cannot
be
effectively
performed
by
most
judges
and
for
those
few
judges
who
could
effectively
perform
it.
it
would
be
highly
inappropriate
to
do
so.
i
might
add
also,
that
the
reason
that
this
ruling
is
so
particularly
crucial
for
prosecutors
throughout
the
nation
is
that
there
is
aside
from
situations
like
those
in
cairo,
illinois.
there
is
in
this
country
a
large
number
of
groups
of
people
who
have
severe
quarrels
with
the
way
criminal
justices
run
whose
quarrels
generally
fall
on
the
side
of
their
viewed
insufficient
prosecution.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
a
very
realistic
possibility
that
if
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit,
this
remedy
is
allowed
to
stand
that
we
will
open
a
real
pandora's
box
with
respect
to
suits
against
prosecutors.
now,
the
pandora's
box
argument
is
a
common
one
i
think
that
at
least
half
the
litigants
who
argued
cases
involving
basic
principles
of
law
will
use
a
variation
of
the
pandora's
box
argument
saying
if
you
do
this
then
the
walls
will
all
fall
down.
and
perhaps
there
is
a
hyperbole
in
that
argument
in
most
cases.
i
think
not
in
the
case
of
the
prosecutor.
there
is
presently
in
the
state
of
illinois,
at
least
several
groups,
who
are
complaining
vigorously
that
although
they
have
not
sued
yet
about
what
they
consider
to
be
insufficient
efforts
by
the
prosecutors
not
to
proceed
in
given
cases.
the
most
prominent
of
which
in
our
state
is
the
citizens
for
decent
literature
who
are
complaining
bitterly
about
the
failure
of
various
prosecutors
to
move
against
literature
they
consider
obscene.
there
is
a
group
of
people
who
claim
to
represent
rape
victims
who
are
concerned
about
the
policies
of
prosecution
with
respect
to
rape
cases.
there
are
groups
that
complain
about
the
prosecutions
with
respect
to
environmental
cases.
and
i
suspect
that
if
the
ruling
stands
up
most
prosecutors
who
have
adopted
a
policy
of
declining
of
anything.
any
violation
of
criminal
statues
involving
in
dispute
between
a
tenant
and
a
landlord,
i
suspect
that
both
the
tenants
and
the
landlords
will
be
in
federal
court
claiming
improper
prosecution.
and
i
might
add
further
that
purely
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
judge
could
administer
this
rather
a
mammoth
remedy
that
is
called
for.
there
is
the
--
the
basic
question
and
i
suppose
this
is
an
argument
that
speaks
more
to
an
immunity
argument
than
to
anything
else.
there
is
the
basic
question
of
forcing
the
prosecutor
to
spend
his
time
in
court
and
defend
his
policies
with
respect
to
discretionary
declamations
of
prosecutions.
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
i
don't
think
any
prosecutor
that
could
long
function
if
he
had
to
depose
on
declamations
of
prosecution.
i
doubt
that
there
is
a
prosecutor
in
this
nation
who
prosecutes
more
than
a
fraction
less
than
one-half.
certainly,
more
than
a
fraction
of
the
cases
that
are
brought
to
him
--
would
he
have
to
come
to
federal
court
and
explain
this
declamation
in
each
and
every
one
of
these
cases?
even
if
the
case
is
not
made,
even
if
the
petitioner
fails
to
make
his
case
so
the
plaintiffs
fail
to
make
their
case.
the
enormous
burden
on
the
prosecutor,
i
think
would
be
a
sufficient
to
justify,
as
it
does
in
other
areas,
the
application
of
an
absolute
immunity
doctrine.
and
it
is
clear
i
might
say.
it
is
clear
that
the
seventh
circuit
contemplated
that
the
federal
district
court
would
address
itself
to
individual
decisions.
there
is
a
certain
selective
blindness
exercised
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
with
respect
to
what
exactly
they
won
if
you
want
to
use
that
word
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
i
quote
from
the
language
on
the
--
of
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
that
said,
"an
initial
decree
might
set
out
the
general
tone
of
rights
to
be
protected
and
require
only
periodic
reports
of
various
types
of
aggregate
data
on
actions
on
bail
and
sentencing
and
disposition
of
complaints."
the
court
expressed
and
i
quote,
"complete
confidence
in
the
district
court's
ability
to
set
up
further
guides
is
required
and
if
necessary
to
consider
individual
decisions"
which
appears
at
page
415
of
468
f.2d.
so
we
are
in
effect
talking
about
review
of
individual
decisions
to
or
not
to
prosecute.
there
has
been
citation
of
authority
in
this
court
in
which
federal
courts
have
exercised
what
might
be
called
a
pretrial
supervision
over
state
prosecutor
by
enjoining
him
from
proceeding
in
a
particular
case.
i
state
as
we
have
stated
in
the
briefs
that
this
is
a
far
different
thing
from
exercising
a
general
power
to
force
the
prosecutor
to
prosecute
a
case
in
a
certain
way
and
i
might
add
that
the
complaint
was
not
limited
simply
to
the
initiation
of
criminal
proceedings.
there
were
elements
in
the
complaint
that
said
that
the
prosecutor
didn't
present
the
case
competently.
perhaps,
the
closing
argument
didn't
appeal
to
the
plaintiffs.
or
perhaps
the
way
a
witness
was
examined
didn't
appeal
to
the
plaintiffs.
you're
talking
about
very
detailed
regulation
of
the
way
a
prosecutor
tries
his
case
and
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit.
and
certainly
what
the
plaintiffs
contemplate.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
those
cases
in
which
preliminary
injunctions
have
been
granted
prior
to
trial
or
at
least
that
has
been
suggested
that
it
might
be
done
are
really
no
different
in
effect
than
a
form
of
accelerated
appellant
review.
so
the
court
saying
in
advance
that
this
prosecution,
this
particular
prosecution
is
brought
in
such
bad
faith
or
for
such
obvious
harassment
purposes
that
we're
going
to
stop
it
now.
and
the
basic
premise
is
that
if
we
did
not
stop
it
now,
we
would
just
have
to
reverse
it
later.
but
it
is
still
a
review
of
an
individual
case.
as
i
suggest
in
the
brief,
there
are
available
and
i
think
superior
remedies,
superior
to
that
suggested
by
the
seventh
circuit.
indeed,
i
would
say
that
each
of
the
remedies
considered
by
the
seventh
circuit
including
the
most
draconian
one
of
all
which
is
to
say
reversal
of
convictions
of
people
who
were
properly
prosecuted
because
the
prosecutor
refuses
to
proceed
against
other
people.
i
think
that
even
that
remedy
is
preferable
to
the
remedy
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
was
take
upon
itself
or
if
not
take
upon
itself
convey
a
power
to
the
federal
district
judges
that
no
court
should
under
any
conditions
ever
exercise
and
that
is
the
power
to
prosecute.
the
federal
judge
simply
should
not
service
a
prosecute.
either
in
state
or
federal
court
and
i
think
that
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
amounts
to
as
a
command
to
the
federal
judge
that
if
certain
cases
are
proven.
you
have
to
preempt
the
decision
of
the
prosecutor
in
state
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
i
have
--
mr.
zagel
before
you
get
started,
if
by
any
chance
you
lose
this
case,
are
you
going
to
pay
the
cost?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
(inaudible)
who
is
going
to
pay
the
cost?
yes,
my
client
can
pay
the
cost?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that
is
the
customary
rule
on
this
(inaudible).
mr.
james
b.
zagel
it
is
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
of
spomer?
yes,
he
is.
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
no,
that
would
be
the
natural
assumption
that
if
we
were
to
lose
the
case,
mr.
spomer
will
get
a
little
bit
of
from
the
clerk
of
the
court
for
the
cost
then
he
would
pay
it.
with
respect
to
the
point
on
substitution,
i
just
point
out
the
rule
483
of
this
court
provides
for
automatic
substitution
in
these
cases.
one
point
that
was
made
by
mr.
wiseman
is
that,
and
it
generally
has
been
and
i
suppose
a
perfectly
acceptable
tactic
for
him
in
the
course
of
argument
as
to
--
is
to
minimize
although
i
don’t
think
he
can
do
so
successfully
what
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
seventh
circuit’s
remedy.
in
one
of
the
words
he
used
is
that
that
somewhere
will
have
to
start
and
this
is
just
the
start
at
determining
what
the
relief
has
to
be
granted.
it’s
really
not
the
start
that
so
much
concerns
us.
it’s
where
the
finish
is
and
no
one
has
denied
yet
and
no
one
has
ever
offered
a
credible
argument
that
the
limits
of
this
doctrine
are
very
broad
indeed
and
i
might
add
that
even
the
start
has
to
be
a
substantial
burden
on
any
prosecutor.
even
a
hearing
has
to
be
a
burden
on
the
prosecutor
and
the
discovery
practice
as
well.
that
too
is
a
burden
and
an
unreasonable
one.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
he
may.
he
may
violate
1981.
and
what
if
he
does
it
knowingly,
willfully
and
does
he
violate
242?
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
he
may.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
if
you
view
it
again
solely
as
an
immunity
argument
rather
than
as
a
remedy
argument.
yes,
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
since
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
that
the
two
basic
points
are
these,
if
the
--
what
the
state’s
attorney
is
doing
constitutes
a
federal
crime
in
violation
of
242.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
that’s
correct.
that
is
their
point.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes,
if
you
take
it
literally.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
well,
that’s
precisely
my
point.
if
you
view
it
solely
as
an
immunity
matter,
no,
my
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
you
also
have
as
i
--
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
in
that
respect,
basically
i
supposed
my
argument
then
goes
--
to
that’s
the
scope
of
the
remedy
rather
than
immunity.
i
think
that
that
is
inherent
and
the
fact
that
i
have
made
to
concessions
which
considering
the
fact
that
this
brief
was
filed,
not
only
in
behalf
of
spomer
but
on
behalf
of
the
national
district
attorney’s
association
as
well.
i
think
a
very
substantial
concession
be,
if
the
that
there
would
be,
if
the
allegations
were
all
true,
remedy
and
federal
criminal
prosecution
which
i
think
is
perhaps
the
greatest
single
deterrence.
and
secondly,
we
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
if
there
has
to
be
any
remedy
at
all,
between
private
parties
in
a
federal
court
that
that
remedy
rather
than
be
the
injunction
be
damages.
i
tend
to
think
that
there
is
a
strong
immunity
argument
against
damages
as
well.
what
i
am
trying
to
impress
upon
the
court
is
the
degree
of
opposition
and
the
degree
perhaps
of
maybe
outright
terror
would
be
the
best
word
with
which
a
state
prosecutors
would
view
proceedings
under
the
seventh
circuits
opinion.
mr.
james
b.
zagel
yes.
there’s
one
final
question
i
would
answer
with
respect
to
the
governor’s
power.
the
governor
has
no
power
in
illinois
at
all
over
the
prosecutor
and
nor
does
the
attorney
general
except
to
nolle
prosequi
a
criminal
charge.
