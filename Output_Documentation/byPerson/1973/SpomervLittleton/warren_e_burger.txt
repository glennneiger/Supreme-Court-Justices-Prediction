we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-955,
spomer
against
littleton.
mr.
shapiro,
you
may
--
oh!
excuse
me,
mr.
zagel.
mr.
zagel
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
essence
he
wants
to
stand
in
berbling's
shoes
in
order
to
test
out
the
underlying
constitutional
issue
and
the
question
really
is
whether
that
involves
in
a
--
perhaps
an
advisory
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
after
lunch.
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
allow
you
little
extra
time.
counsel,
you
seem
to
have
been
interrupted,
mr.
zagel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
suppose,
concerns
say
that
your
posture
is
necessary
to
try
to
preserve
this
litigation
for
the
larger
issue
that
you've
talked
about
before
lunch?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
appears
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
designed
to
keep
the
litigation
alive
as
you
are
today
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
wiseman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that
could
be
traditionally
noticed
by
the
seventh
circuit,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
similarity
between
the
kind
of
continuing
monitoring
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
prescribed
here?
and
the
continuing
monitoring
and
that
the
sixth
circuit
prescribed
in
gilligan
against
morgan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
perhaps
the
national
guard
case
where
the
sixth
circuit
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
prescribe
the
proper
weapons
and
methods
and
procedures
for
the
national
guard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
governor
of
illinois
have
any
supervisory
power
over
a
local
prosecutor
as
for
example
the
state
of
new
york
provides?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
even
be
removed
by
him
as
they
can
in
new
