unknown
speaker
is
that
pending?
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
jurisdictional
problem?
unknown
speaker
but
if
these
claims
--
if
this
people
have
never
experienced
anything
at
the
hands
of
the
latest
prosecutor,
is
there
any
case
of
controversy
between
them
and
the
prosecutor?
unknown
speaker
statutory
claim
under
1983
or
1984?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
urge
that
your
waiver
is
burdening
on
us,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
what
is
there
in
the
complaint
that
goes
against
the
office?
unknown
speaker
this
sounds
like
a
case
with
somebody
is
charged
with
a
crime
of
murder
and
his
successor
comes
in
office
and
says,
i'm
also
guilty.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
shows
that
the
successor
in
office
intends
to
do
what
the
other
man
did?
no,
it's
not
in
this
record.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
cut
you
off?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
cut
you
off?
unknown
speaker
record-wise?
unknown
speaker
[interruption]
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
that
your
client
says
he
would
do
all
the
things
that
were
alleged
in
this
complaint?
unknown
speaker
my
specific
question
that
he
intends
to
do
the
type
of
things
that
are
alleged
in
this
complaint?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
he
--
admits
them
that
the
allegations
are
true?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking,
does
he
admit
them?
unknown
speaker
not
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation
does
he
admit
them
or
not?
does
he
intend
to
do
these
things?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
ask
you
to
go
outside
the
record.
but
what
if
the
allegations
as
alleged
amount
to
a
crime
under
242?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
as
he
says
he
is
going
to
violate
the
federal
statutes?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
thing
that
bothers
me
mr.
zagel,
in
so
far
as
the
this
is
a
1983
suit,
1983
in
terms
creates
an
action
only
against
and
i'm
reading
it,
"every
person
who
under
color
and
so
forth
subjects
or
causes
to
be
subjected,
any
citizen
to
a
deprivation
of
rights,
etcetera."
and
i
don't
see
how
this
pleaded
as
a
1983
action.
the
successor
comes
within
it.
unknown
speaker
at
the
times
those
things
were
arrested
and
done.
unknown
speaker
so
if
he
has
said
that
--
if
he
has
said
he
is
going
to
continue
the
policies
if
he
hasn't
done
it
he
is
threatening
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
or
he
can't
--
can
he
judicially
notice
the
fact
that
he
substituted
himself?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
before
you
do
whether
shepherd
is
--
has
been
employed
by
the
present
state’s
attorney?
unknown
speaker
so
he
has
an
agent?
continuous?
unknown
speaker
and
so
far
as
your
complaint
was
against
his
actions
as
an
agent
of
the
state’s
attorney,
there
is
a
continuity
then?
unknown
speaker
but
isn’t
the
issue
of
by
carriers’
liability
under
1983
somewhat
unsettled?
isn’t
that
kind
of
injecting
a
new
element
into
the
case
if
you
have
to
rely
on
that?
unknown
speaker
that
he
didn’t
give
your
clients
the
protection
of
the
criminal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
case
last
term.
the
linda
r.
or
linda
s.
case
on
standing,
(inaudible)
--
the
court
holding
the
lack
of
standing
in
a
person
to
complain
that
a
criminal
law
was
not
being
enforced
so
as
to
protect
her?
unknown
speaker
could've
been
more
--
no
any
more
pattern
than
there
was
in
this
case
last
term?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
it
customary
for
a
party
too?
unknown
speaker
do
you
admit
that
you
are
a
party
for
the
purpose
it
cost?
unknown
speaker
if
a
prosecutor
brings
or
refuses
to
bring
a
criminal
or
say
brings
a
criminal
prosecution
in
circumstances
where
he
ordinarily
wouldn’t
embrace
it
because
of
race,
would
you
suppose
he
violates
1981?
unknown
speaker
so
he
always
has
a
criminal
sanction
over
him.
any
way
if
he
intentionally
and
willfully
conducts
himself?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
cuts
--
he
--
that
cuts
both
ways
i
suppose
that
it
does
put
the
injunction
in
a
different
light
if
all
this
--
if
what
he
is
enjoined
from
doing
or
is
not
acting
intentionally
and
willfully
based
on
race?
unknown
speaker
one
file
that
had
it
both
ways,
as
well
as
a
remedy
and
--
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
after
all,
i
gathered
from
what
your
opponent
said
that
all
they
were
claiming
and
all
of
the
protection
against
were
intentional
and
lawful
acts
based
on
race.
nothing
--
not
a
mistake
or
maybe
not?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
that
if
you
take
that
literally,
it
means
that
242
would
be
violated
by
these
acts?
unknown
speaker
and
the
--
well,
doesn’t
that
put
the
injunction
and
issue
in
a
different
light
too,
if
you
are
enjoined
only
from
acting
intentionally?
unknown
speaker
certainly,
you
wouldn't
--
would
you
say,
the
immunity
reaches
the
court?
unknown
speaker
no,
immunity
is
not
(voice
overlap).
then
the
question
is
whether
equity
should
enjoin
it?
unknown
speaker
and
ordinarily
you’d
say
equity
doesn’t
enjoin
the
crime,
our
commission
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
that
the
--
here
you
have
a
high
policy
federal
statute?
1983
and
1981?
unknown
speaker
in
1983
having
been
held
to
be
exempt
from
one
of
their
restraints
on
a
federal
court?
in
the
injunction.
unknown
speaker
the
idea
would
be,
it
wouldn't
that
it
might
not
be
so
hard
to
defend
themselves
but
i
mean,
it
might
not
be
so
hard
to
win
but
it
will
be
terribly
burdensome
defending
himself
against
perhaps
a
series
of
unsubstantiated
charges?
unknown
speaker
is
that
pending?
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
jurisdictional
problem?
unknown
