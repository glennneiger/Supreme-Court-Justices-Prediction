arguments

mr.

you
may
proceed

corrected
as
to
future,
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
two
years
approximately
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
beginning
in
april
1970?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
for
how
long,
about
a
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
order
would
name
in
this
sequence
at
that
time
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
civil,
of
the
criminal
division
or
who
would
be
the
named
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
effect
this
was
following
the
practice
that
is
routinely
done
with
ordinary
letters
every
--
day-to-day
as
distinguished
from
applications
to
a
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
that
test
must
be
made
by
assuming
the
truth
and
accuracy
of
everything
that’s
in
the
paper
--
on
the
paper.
it
is
nevertheless
deficient,
if
that’s
the
word
of
the
statute,
insufficient
on
its
face?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
number
one
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
that
embrace
a
situation
where
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
field
or
his
assistant
just
went
out
and
placed
the
tap
without
any
authority
from
anybody,
would
that
be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
the
--
yes.
that
would
be
one
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
would
be
under
number
one
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
authority
whatever.
well,
i
was
starting
from
the
[voice
overlap]
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
there
would
be
a
spectrum
of
situations
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
under
--
this
would
all
fall
under
number
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
statute
would
have
a
different
meaning
mr.
solicitor
general
if
now
calling
your
attention
first
to
2518
where
all
the
language
is
mandatory
shall
be
made
in
writing,
shall
the
state
the
applicant’s
authority,
shall
include
the
following.
having
that
in
mind
and
then
dropping
down
to
(10)
(a),
instead
of
reading
as
it
does
now,
any
aggrieved
person
may
move
to
suppress.
thus
the
statute
had
read
that
any
evidence
obtained
in
--
not
in
conformity
with
the
following
paragraphs,
one,
two
and
three
shall
be
excluded
from
evidence
for
all
purposes.
do
you
think
my
hypothetical
statute
that
i’ve
just
tried
to
construct
would
be
a
different
statute
form
one
that
was
written?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
but
this
does
not
anywhere
in
the
statute
to
say
anything
about
what
the
court
shall
do.
it
says
what
the
party
may
do.
the
party
may
move
to
suppress.
that
certainly
gives
an
implication
that
the
courts
--
this
isn’t
an
idle
gesture
and
that
the
court
is
going
to
entertain
the
motion.
now,
what
is
the
range
of
the
judge’s
discretion
when
that
motion
is
made
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
how
about
number
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
does
incorporate
into
the
statute,
the
judicially
constructed
exclusionary
rule,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
question
about
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
respect
do
you,
distinguish
it
all
between
what
we
might
call
this,
the
lindenbaum
authorizations
and
those
actually
made
by
the
attorney
general
but
which
mr.
wilson
did
not
in
fact
act
upon.
is
there
any
difference
in
your
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
do
for
a
moment.
is
it
--
the
strength
of
your
argument
that
if
in
fact
the
attorney
general
who
had
the
power
did
make
the
decision
that
the
confusion
about
mr.
will
wilson
is
irrelevant
because
the
attorney
general
had
greater
power,
since
he
was
the
source
of
the
power,
it
has
made
no
difference,
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
spoke
of
a
special
unit
handling
these
matters.
was
that
a
special
unit
apart
from
the
criminal
division
or
within
the
criminal
division?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now
is
that
--
are
you
suggesting
that
that
had
a
certain
autonomy
and
that
they
were
functioning
in
this
special
field
on
their
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
autonomy,
i’m
speaking,
autonomy
from
the
regular
staff
line
of
command
of
the
criminal
division.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
smouse.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
your
case,
to
be
sure
i
have
it
absolutely
clear,
withstand
independent
--
independently
even
if
there
was
no
such
thing
as
the
doctrine
of
exclusion
of
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statute
has
prescribed
the
remedy,
is
your
case
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
get
that
last.
it
does
lead
to
an
identifiable
office,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
incumbent,
whoever
is
the
incumbent
of
that
office
is
the
identifiable
person,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whoever
is,
the
attorney
general
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it’s
an
identifiable
office
in
terms
of
which
changes,
in
terms
of
the
incumbency
from
time
to
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
attorney
general
have
under
this
statute
lawfully
designated
all
of
the
assistant
attorneys
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
acting
assistant
attorneys
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
do
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
in
the
statute
do
you
find
this
limited
to
those
confirmed
by
the
senate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
present
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
smouse,
is
it
essential
to
your
case
that
that
be
that
--
the
standard.
is
not
the
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
where
they
have
one
as
much
subject
to
the
political
process
in
the
sense
that
if
the
assistant
attorney
general
is
dismissed,
leaves
or
resigns,
the
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
is
there
at
sufferance.
are
not
all
the
political,
the
truly
political
appointees
whether
appointed
by
the
president
or
by
the
attorney
general,
are
they
not
at
all
responsive
to
the
political
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
the
statute
doesn’t
say
anything
about
senatorially
confirmed.
you
draw
that
from
the
legislative
history.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
got
it
from
the
language,
the
political
language
but
surely
a
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
selected
whether
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
himself
or
by
the
attorney
general,
but
in
fact
appointed
by
the
attorney
general
is
politically
responsive
is
the
sense
of
that
legislative
history,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
they
particularly
say
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
each
division
of
the
department
of
justice
has
one,
two
or
possibly
three
exempt
positions
at
the
top
echelon,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
they
are
not
embraced
within
this
political
process?
there’s
something
less
than
political
but
different
from
career?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
to
pursue
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
inquiry
a
few
moments
ago,
if
you
had
a
period
where
you
had
an
acting
attorney
general
appointed
under
a
recess
appointment,
who
might
act
for
quite
a
while
as
some
have,
you
would
be
immobilized
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn’t
you
--
wouldn’t
the
government
immediately
run
under
the
proposition
that
when
a
principal
ceased
to
hold
the
power
all
his
agents
fell
with
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
smouse.
mr.
hewitt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
essential
to
your
case
mr.
hewitt
that
the
court
was
in
fact
misled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
end
if
isn’t
it?
whether
the
court
was
affected
by
that
or
whether
it
was
not
affected
from
your
case,
that’s
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
even
if
you
stopped
before
you
got
to
what
the
judge
believed
or
what
he
thought
he
was
acting
on
or
what
he
relied
on,
you
think
you’d
have
your
case
in
the
same
posture
you
have
it
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
an
application
were
presented
to
a
district
judge
mr.
hewitt,
which
recited
the
correct
facts,
that
is
that
this
in
detail,
that
this
application
was
signed
by
mr.
sol
lindenbaum
on
behalf
of,
note
that
mr.
sol
lindenbaum
acting
for
the
attorney
general
authorized
mr.
will
wilson
to
make
this
application.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
--
you
think
that
would
not
comply
with
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
district
judge
might
look
at
the
statute
and
say,
“you
can’t
do
this
with
mr.
lindenbaum,
whoever
he
may
be,”
says
the
district
judge
out
in
california.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
correctly
recited,
this
application
was
authorized
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
by
his
designation
of
mr.
will
wilson,
would
you
think
the
district
judge
would
be
misled
in
the
same
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
does
not
the
greater
authority
of
the
attorney
general
swallow
the
lesser
authority
of
any
assistant
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
make
that
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
recall
now
mr.
hewitt
too
clearly,
did
judge
duniway
of
the
--
for
the
ninth
circuit
would
rely
on
both
1
and
2
of
section
10?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
2518?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i’m
talking
now
about
the
subdivisions
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
1,
2
and
3
that
the
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted.
judge
sobeloff
did
not
track
the
district
judge’s
inclusions
in
this
respect,
that
is
he
put
them,
this
is
on
number
2
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i’m
just
wondering,
did
judge
duniway
have
a
bracket
to
whole
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
1
and
2.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
assuming
hypothetically
that
2518
(10)
(a)
(1),
(2)
and
(3)
did
not
by
implication
cover
this;
certainly,
section
2515
is
explicit,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice

the
disposition
of
72-1319,
united

72-1057,

and
72-6160,

be
announced
by
mr.

chief

we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-1057

the

well,
let
me
get
that
last.
it
does
lead
to
an
identifiable
office,
does
it
not?
chief

warren
e.

well,
the
incumbent,
whoever
is
the
incumbent
of
that
office
is
the
identifiable
person,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.

whoever
is,
the

chief

so
it’s
an
identifiable

in

of
which
changes,
in
terms
of
the
incumbency
from

to
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
attorney
general
have
under
this
statute
lawfully
designated
all
of
the
assistant
attorneys
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.

and
acting
assistant

chief

they
do
not.
chief

where
in
the
statute
do
you
find
this
limited
to
those
confirmed

chief

the

chief

mr.

is
it
essential

--
the
standard.
is
not
the
deputy
assistant

where
they
have
one
as
much
subject
to
the
political
process
in
the
sense
that
if

the

not

the
political,
the
truly
political
appointees
whether
appointed
by
the

by

are
they
not
at
all
responsive
to

chief

warren
e.

only
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
the
statute
doesn’t
say
anything
about
senatorially
confirmed.
you
draw
that
from
the
legislative
history.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
got
it
from
the
language,
the
political
language
but
surely
a
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
selected
whether
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
himself
or
by
the
attorney
general,
but
in
fact
appointed
by
the
attorney

is
politically
responsive
is
the
sense
of
that
legislative
history,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
they
particularly
say
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
each
division
of
the
department
of
justice
has
one,
two
or
possibly
three
exempt
positions
at
the
top
echelon,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
they
are
not
embraced
within
this
political
process?
there’s
something
less
than
political
but
different
from
career?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
to
pursue
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
inquiry
a
few
moments
ago,
if
you
had
a
period
where
you
had
an
acting
attorney
general
appointed
under
a
recess
appointment,
who
might
act
for
quite
a
while
as
some
have,
you
would
be
immobilized
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn’t
you
--
wouldn’t
the
government
immediately
run
under
the
proposition
that
when
a
principal
ceased
to
hold
the
power
all
his
agents
fell
with
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
smouse.
mr.
hewitt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
essential
to
your
case
mr.
hewitt
that
the
court
was
in
fact
misled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
end
if
isn’t
it?
whether
the
court
was
affected
by
that
or
whether
it
was
not
affected
from
your
case,
that’s
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
even
if
you
stopped
before
you
got
to
what
the
judge
believed
or
what
he
thought
he
was
acting
on
or
what
he
relied
on,
you
think
you’d
have
your
case
in
the
same
posture
you
have
it
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
an
application
were
presented
to
a
district
judge
mr.
hewitt,
which
recited
the
correct
facts,
that
is
that
this
in
detail,
that
this
application
was
signed
by
mr.
sol
lindenbaum
on
behalf
of,
note
that
mr.
sol
lindenbaum
acting
for
the
attorney
general
authorized
mr.
will
wilson
to
make
this
application.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
--
you
think
that
would
not
comply
with
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
district
judge
might
look
at
the
statute
and
say,
“you
can’t
do
this
with
mr.
lindenbaum,
whoever
he
may
be,”
says
the
district
judge
out
in
california.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
correctly
recited,
this
application
was
authorized
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
by
his
designation
of
mr.
will
wilson,
would
you
think
the
district
judge
would
be
misled
in
the
same
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
does
not
the
greater
authority
of
the
attorney
general
swallow
the
lesser
authority
of
any
assistant
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
make
that
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
recall
now
mr.
hewitt
too
clearly,
did
judge
duniway
of
the

for
the
ninth
circuit

rely
on
both
1
and
2
of
section
10?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
2518?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i’m
talking
now
about
the
subdivisions
of

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

and

that
the

judge
sobeloff
did
not
track
the
district
judge’s
inclusions
in
this
respect,
that
is
he
put
them,
this
is
on
number
2
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i’m
just
wondering,
did
judge
duniway
have
a
bracket
to
whole
area?
chief
justice

e.

and

chief
