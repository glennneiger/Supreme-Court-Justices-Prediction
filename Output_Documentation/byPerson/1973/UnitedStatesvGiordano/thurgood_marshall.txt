justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
way
in
the
world
that
the
judge
could
know
that
mr.
lindenbaum
had
approved
it
and
not
the
attorney
general?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
was
a
reason
for
them
to
make
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you’re
actually
doing,
you
were
telling
the
judge
that
either
mr.
wilson
or
the
attorney
general
approved
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
fact
the
executive
assistant
was
doing
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
the
one
--
those
are
the
ones
i’m
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
--
mr.
wilson
wasn’t
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wilson
was
doing
what
mr.
lindenbaum
told
him
to
do
with
mr.
mitchell’s
signature.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
that
happens
so
often.
i
hope
it
doesn’t
happen
so
often
when
you
are
interfering
with
people's
rights
of
privacy
etcetera?
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay,
go
ahead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
[inaudible]
mr.
will
wilson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
he
didn’t
give
will
wilson
an
authority
while
he
was
out
of
town?
justice
thurgood
marshall
after
all,
will
wilson
was
approved
by
congress,
wasn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
mr.
lindenbaum
was
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
mean
congress,
i
mean
the
senate.
what
i
mean,
it
was
a
approved
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
--
why
i
think
your
answers
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
done
it
but
it’s
not
wrong
the
way
he
did
it
and
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
are
the
deputy
attorney
general
that
go
over
run
around
loose
over
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assistant
attorney
general?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
of
course
there
are,
the
attorney
general,
aren’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
don’t
--
they
carry
out
the
policy
of
the
attorney
general.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
when
you
carry
out
the
policy,
didn’t
he
participate
that
in
many
of
these
cases
as
mr.
lindenbaum
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
he
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
did?
who
was
his
deputy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
he
went
away
he
says
on
other
things,
you
take
over
too,
assuming
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
already
been
done,
hasn’t
it?
hadn't
the
department
of
justice
already
have
done
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
don’t
have
to
do
that
[inaudible],
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
the
audit
said
that
it
was
done
by
will
wilson
and
a
matter
of
fact,
it
had
been
done
by
john
mitchell?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
would
do
what
to
wilson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know,
it’s
not
what
i
said.
i
said
where
the
letter
is
signed
by
wilson
and
it
says
that
i
have
approved
this.
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
not
approved
this,
but
john
mitchell
is
courts
to
prove
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
wrong
for
what
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
though
the
subordinate
signed
it,
the
boss
decided
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
way
in
the
world
that
the
judge
could
know
