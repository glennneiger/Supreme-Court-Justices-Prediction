justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
did
this
happen
mr.
solicitor
general?
it
just
happened,
this
is
the
way
things
happen
to
work
out,
nobody
caught
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
order
that
came
back
down
from
the
attorney
general
actually
did
say,
you
are
authorized
to
notify
it,
didn’t
it
--
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fact
was
that
at
stage,
the
attorney
general
has
already
approved
it
and
in
effect
it
was
an
order
to
wilson
to
go
ahead
and
approve
it
himself,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
even
if
it’s
a
statutory
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
once
you
decide
what
that
is,
what
is
unlawful
then
you
get
to
your
point
that
the
--
if
you
decide
it’s
unlawful,
there's
no
discretion.
you
must
suppress
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
--
because
2515
said
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
is
not
2518,
2515
says,
it
must
be
suppressed,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
rely
on
a
confirmation?
justice
byron
r.
white
2515
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
both
unlawful.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
giordano
case
number
72-1057
comes
here
from
the
fourth
circuit
on
certiorari,
and
chavez
from
the
ninth
circuit
on
--
also
on
certiorari.
these
two
cases
raise
related
questions
under
the
federal
statute,
authorizing
official
wiretapping
under
a
court
order.
under
the
statute
only
the
attorney
general
or
an
assistant
attorney
general,
specially
authorized
by
him
is
permitted
to
approve
an
application
or
a
wiretap
order.
in
the
giordano
case,
the
attorney
general
had
authorized
his
executive
assistant
to
approve
wiretap
applications,
in
the
name
of
the
attorney
general
when
that
officer
was
absent
from
the
city.
the
question
is
whether
that
procedure
comports
with
the
act,
and
if
it
is
not
whether
the
evidence
obtained
from
a
wiretap
under
an
order
that
was
so
authorized
is
admissible
or
inadmissible.
we
hold
that
an
application
approved
in
that
manner
does
not
comply
with
the
act,
and
that
evidence
obtained
from
a
wiretap
under
such
an
order,
where
the
application
has
been
so
approved,
is
admissible
in
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
had
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion,
and
so
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
from
part
four
of
the
opinion.
he
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
otherwise
he
concurs
in
the
opinion.
