justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
the
fact
in
each
of
these
cases,
what
was
told
that
the
judge,
any
chances
was
not
quite
accurate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
wasn’t
my
question.
i
gather
though
that
what
the
information
the
judge
had
before
him
was
not
accurate
information
at
all,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that’s
[laughter]
rather
important,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
i
see
if
i
get
this
clearly.
18
u.s.c.
2518
(1)
(a),
i
think
that’s
the
one
you
just
referred
to,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
each
application,
that
means
the
application
to
the
judge,
does
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
shall
include,
shall
include
the
following
information:
(a)
the
identity
of
the
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officer
making
the
application
and
do
i
understand
that
none
of
these
applications
accurately
identified
the
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officer
making
the
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
officer
authorizing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
of
them
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
none
of
these
applications
complied
with
that
provision
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
i
suppose
mr.
solicitor
general
what
this
will
come
down
to,
is
being
as
you
opened
in
the
statement
a
statutory
matter
is
what
significance
did
the
congress
attach
to
that
provision
requiring
that
the
application
identify
the
officer
authorizing
the
application,
doesn’t
it?
not
withstanding
all
of
this,
if
the
congress
had
a
purpose
for
making
that
requirement
and
that
purpose
s
not
satisfied
by
these
procedures
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
depending
on
everything
you’ve
said
that
i
spoke
--
i
expect
to
–
it
is
still
a
statutory
violation,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
it
doesn’t
--
you
may
not
concede
it
but
that’s
what
the
issue
comes
down
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather,
when
you
get
to
whether
or
not
it
was
a
statutory
violation,
you
will
address
don’t
you
that
report
of
the
--
the
senate
report
in
which
--
in
the
dealing
with
this
requirement,
the
emphasis
was
on
the
lines
of
responsibility
leading
to
an
unidentifiable
person?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
this
provision
itself
should
go
a
long
way
for
guaranteeing
that
no
abuses
will
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
not
but
behind
the
scenes,
that’s
quite
true.
but
the
question
is
whether
what
was
before
the
judge
at
the
time
of
the
application
satisfied
that
requirement
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
effect
of
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
that
provision
2515,
whenever
any
wire
or
oral
communication
is
intercepted,
no
part
of
the
content
of
self-communication
and
no
evidence
derived
there
from,
may
be
received
in
evidence
in
any
trial
before
any
court,
disclosure
of
that
information
would
be
in
violation
to
this
chapter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
the
provision,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
of
these
cases
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
39?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
2518
is
to
be
read
without
reference
to
2515?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
2515
is
certainly
explicit,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
think
this
statute
is
certainly
is
a
model
of
clarity
by
any
means,
and
like
any
of
us
who
had
to
wrestle
with
it,
but
we
think
so
but
at
least
2515
is
susceptible,
isn’t
it?
and
the
interpretation,
no
evidence
derived
there
from,
maybe
received
in
evidence,
any
trial
before
any
court
that
the
disclosure
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
the
draft
of
this
statute,
mr.
solicitor
general
would
have
authorized
the
united
states
attorney
to
make
the
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
the
--
it
was
justice
that
came
in
and
said,
it
was
mr.
miller
wasn’t
it
that
preferred
it
limit
to
the
attorney
general
or
an
assistant
designated
by
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
know,
are
any
court
of
appeals,
the
other
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it’s
only
the
second
circuit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
the
last
acting
attorney
general,
mr
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
the
