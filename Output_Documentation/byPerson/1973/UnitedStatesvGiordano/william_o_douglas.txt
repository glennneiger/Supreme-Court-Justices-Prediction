it
is
hardly
ministerial
to
describe
the
issue
in
some
of
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
what
you
said
brought
me
up
rather
sharply
because
in
--
when
i
was
in
the
executive
branch,
this
was
a
recurring
problem
that
we
never
dreamed
to
delegate
anybody,
deciding
the
subpoenas
in
your
name?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
this
is
--
we’re
getting
at
the
same
thing.
justice
william
o.
douglas
they're
collecting
evidence.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
statute
provides
for
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
that
connection,
when
cases
come
here
from
the
state
courts
it’s
traditionally
been
the
argument
that
the
remedy,
the
sanctions
are
[inaudible]
and
prosecute
the
policemen,
or
the
man,
criminal
for
doing
this
unlawful
taps
or
secondly
the
citizen
who
send
your
--
sue
under
1983
for
damages,
do
you
think
if
those
alternatives
would
be
available
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
about
violations
of
a
procedure,
for
generating
the
search?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
justice
stewart
was
right
to
get
down
to
those
sanctions
and
unless
its
suppressed.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
argument
solicitor
general
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
man
is
is
not
in
the
prison,
it
has
echoes
of
the
harmless
error
argument.
everything
you
say,
there’s
nothing
--
they
violate
the
statute
that
it
was
--
in
an
irrelevant,
immaterial
way?
