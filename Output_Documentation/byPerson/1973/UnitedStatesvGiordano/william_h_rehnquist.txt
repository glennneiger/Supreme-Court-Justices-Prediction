congress
had
felt
all
that,
in
the
case
of
the
states
that
was
pretty
much
as
matter
for
the
states
to
decide
for
themselves
but
in
the
case
of
the
federal
government,
they
wanted
to
lay
down
more
stringent
standards
than
they
were
willing
to
impose
on
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
of
course
then
it's
virtually
an
abandonment
of
the
notion
that
you
don’t
--
that
you
want
to
identify
the
man,
to
say
so,
he
can
delegate
it
so
long
as
his
signature
appears
because
presumably
in
the
most
elaborate
bureaucracy
in
the
world,
the
headman
signature
appears
on
the
thing
before
it
goes
out?

did
robinson

but
there
was
an
appeal
of
the
court

appeals,

justice
william

rehnquist
do
you
think
your
case
is
stronger
or
weaker
on
respect
to
a
judge
made
exclusionary
rule
in
a
situation
like
this
where
congress
has
laid
down
statutory
qualifications
and
then
itself
provided
the
circumstances
under
which
there
should
be
suppression
or
in
a
case
like
mcnabb
where
simply
congress
has
enacted
a
statutory
prohibition,
has
said
nothing
about
suppression.

the
judges
freer
in

case

the

justice
william

well,
then
there
really
wouldn’t
be
any
of
our
supervisory
power,
or
just
be
a
statutory
interpretation.
