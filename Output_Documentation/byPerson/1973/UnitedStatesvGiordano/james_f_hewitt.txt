mr.
james
f.
hewitt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
while
the
issues
in
chavez
involve
both
types
of
wiretaps
here,
the
sol
lindenbaum
approved
tap
and
the
john
mitchell
approved
tap,
since
this
court
granted
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
limited
to
the
issue
of
the
tap
purportedly
approved
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
chavez
decision
which
based
the
decision
as
to
that
tap
solely
upon
the
application
of
2518,
i’ll
try
and
limit
my
remarks
to
that
aspect
to
this
total
problem,
but
there
maybe
some
overlapping
of
necessity.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
issue
is
important
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
involves
a
very
important
question
of
congressional
intent
in
the
enactment
of
this
legislation
that
affects
the
very
sensitive
area
in
this
modern
electronic
age.
and
secondly,
the
important
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
compliance
by
the
justice
department
with
this
mandate
of
congress
which
surrounds
virtually
this
authorization
to
engage
in
these
authorized
wiretaps.
it’s
obvious
i
think
from
the
legislative
history
and
certainly
from
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
institutional
decision
was
of
some
concern
to
congress.
mr.
justice
marshal
asked
the
question
of
how
often
do
these
institutional
decisions
happen
and
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
they
happen
often
enough
over
the
history
of
our
justice
department
that
congress
was
concerned
about
it
and
wanted
to
make
sure
that
these
wiretap
applications
would
not
be
the
subject
of
institutional
decisions,
they
would
not
be
rubber
stamped
and
they
would
not
be
handled
by
a
subordinate
members
of
the
justice
department
no
matter
how
knowledgeable
nor
how
responsible
they
might
be
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
legislative
history
is
clear,
that
congress
wanted
a
responsible
high
ranking
department
official
to
make
these
decisions
and
recognizing
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
conceivably
review
and
make
these
important
decisions
in
every
case,
he
was
empowered
to
designate
an
assistant
attorney
general,
a
specifically
identifiable
officer
within
the
department
to
act
on
these
applications
and
make
this
decisions
on
his
behalf.
now,
the
purpose
of
this
was
obviously
to
fix
responsibility
on
this
identifiable
person
so
that
in
later
years
or
should
a
wiretap
become
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion,
or
abuse
of
prosecuted
discretion,
that
congress
and
the
public
and
the
courts
could
put
their
finger
on
that
responsible
individual
and
point
the
finger
--
the
responsibility
to
him.
and
for
that
reason,
congress
made
a
rather
unique
provision
in
the
statute
that
he
be
identified
with
particularity
not
only
in
the
application
but
in
the
court
order
itself.
that
he’d
be
identified
in
the
reports
that
the
district
judge
must
make
within
10
days
after
the
completion
of
the
wiretap.
that
he’d
be
identified
by
the
administrative
officer
of
courts
and
the
annual
report
of
the
director
and
the
annual
report
of
the
judicial
conference,
so
that
this
particular
individual
must
be
identified
throughout
the
entire
reporting
scheme
as
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
wiretap
which
bears
his
name.
and
of
course,
the
way
to
get
this
information
is
to
have
him
set
forth
with
accurate
particularity
in
the
application
and
the
order.
now,
the
statutory
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
represent
the
respondents
in
chavez,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i’m
appointed
to
represent
the
respondent
apodaca
but
i’m
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
other
respondents
also.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that’s
correct
your
honor.
he
is
the
only
one
i
was
appointed
by
the
district
court
to
represent.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
correspondence
in
the
file
from
some
of
the
other
counsels
to
that
effect.
the
statute
sets
forth
in
essence
a
broader,
a
broader
set
of
requirements
than
are
customarily
have
found
in
the
search
warrants.
it
sets
forth
that
there
must
be
a
finding
of
need
for
the
wiretap.
there
must
be
a
finding
of
probable
cause
and
there
must
be
this
important
prosecutor
decision
by
this
responsible
officer.
the
mere
fact
that
the
district
judge
need
not
pass
upon
the
propriety
of
the
prosecuted
decision
of
the
responsible
officer,
doesn’t
make
it
any
less
and
important
prong
of
this
protective
device
that
congress
setup
within
the
statutory
scheme.
the
court
does
have
to
find
a
need
for
the
wiretap
and
that
other
methods
are
unlikely
to
succeed
if
tried
and
must
find
probable
cause,
but
the
court
relying
upon
the
representations
in
the
papers
presented
to
it,
must
assume
that
a
proper
prosecutor
determination
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
justifies
this
gross
intrusion
has
been
made
and
find
that
it
has
been
made
by
a
responsible
officer
as
named
in
the
statute
and
this
is
where
the
courts
were
misled
in
this
particular
case.
now,
the
government
doesn’t
seem
to
feel
that’s
a
particularly
important
factor
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor
because
the
statute
wasn’t
complied
with
if
the
wrong
person
was
placed
in.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it
is
unnecessary,
but
it
certainly
makes
the
violation
certainly
more
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
we
would
your
honor.
and
as
a
result
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it
would
be
bad
your
honor
because
it
identifies
the
wrong
person.
when
in
later
years
someone
wishes
to
put
the
finger
of
responsibility
for
the
chavez
wiretap,
they
would
go
to
the
records
of
the
court,
the
records
of
the
administrative
office
and
wilson
would
be
the
party
responsible.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
they
might
say,
“wilson
how
dare
you
authorize
this
improper
wiretap.”
mr.
wilson
will
say,
“i
didn’t
sign
that
letter,
it
was
signed
by
one
of
my
subordinates.”
this
is
exactly
what
congress
wanted
to
prevent.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
this
is
the
position
in
the
chavez
case
your
honor,
that
pretty
much
the
status
of
the
facts.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
because
the
order
must
identify
the
person
who
actually
approved
the
wiretap.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
it
must
identify
the
proper
person.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
so
that
this
accurate
information
can
you
might
say
be
disseminated
to
the
interested
parties,
congress
and
the
public
and
certainly
the
district
judge
who
makes
the
determination.
because
of
this
false
letter,
because
of
this
letter
bearing
someone
else’s
signature
purporting
to
be
will
wilson
and
purporting
to
state
in
the
body
of
the
letter
that
wilson
reviewed
this
file,
that
he
carefully
looked
at
it,
that
he
determined
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
requires
a
wiretap,
that
i
found
probable
cause,
i
found
that
other
needs,
i
apply
my
experience
and
my
position
as
assistant
attorney
general
and
i
make
this
important
decision.
he
represents
this
in
the
letter
that
wasn’t
even
signed
by
him.
as
a
result
of
that,
a
false
application
is
made
to
the
district
court.
the
determination
the
district
judge
makes
to
order
the
wiretap,
to
authorize
it
as
based
upon
a
false
representation.
false
information
is
incorporated
into
the
court
order
which
the
judge
signs
in
this
file.
it
causes
the
district
judge
to
make
a
false
report
to
the
administrative
office
that
wilson
had
authorized
this
tap.
it
causes
the
administrative
office
to
make
a
false
report
in
its
annual
report
which
is
subject
to
public
scrutiny.
the
entire
scheme
is
false
because
this
letter
is
not
true.
will
wilson
was
not
designated
to
authorize
the
tap
nor
did
he
ever
see
the
file.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
if
the
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
and
for
this
reason
your
honor.
nowhere
in
this
case
does
john
mitchell
say
that
he
ever
saw
this
file,
that
he
ever
reviewed
or
he
did
more
than
authorize
it.
will
wilson
says,
“i
have
carefully
reviewed
the
file.
i
had
exercised
my
discretion.
i
make
this
finding,
i
make
that
finding,
i’m
satisfied.”
if
mr.
mitchell
signed
this
letter
saying,
“i
personally
as
attorney
general
have
reviewed
this
file
and
made
these
determinations
then
i
think
the
district
judge
must
rely
upon
those
determinations.”
but
here,
the
district
judge
rightfully
and
justifiably
believed
that
these
decisions
were
made
by
will
wilson,
the
assistant
attorney
general
who
says
he
reviewed
the
file
and
made
these
important
decisions.
and
this
is
simply,
i
urge
your
honors,
it
isn’t
simply
the
finding
of
probable
cause
indeed.
i
think
the
prosecuted
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
the
type
of
case
that
justifies
a
wiretap
is
a
very
important
one
and
i
think
the
legislative
scheme
shows
that
there
was
not
to
be
a
rubber
stamp,
a
blanket
authority
to
tap
any
telephone.
only
those
phones
that
the
attorney
general
or
a
responsible
designated
assistant
finds
to
justify
this
intrusion
maybe
used
and
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
important
decisions
that
the
district
judge
was
misled
on
as
to
who
might
have
made
that
decision.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
that’s
not
a
particularly
important
facet
to
the
statutory
scheme
and
i
would
submit
to
you
your
honors
that
it
is
very
important.
that
it's
important
in
the
sense
that
from
the
congressional
record
on
august
11,
1969,
chairman
mcclellan
summarized
the
first
year
of
operation
unto
the
omnibus
crime
bill
and
he
stated
that
apparently,
and
i
call
the
courts
attention
to
page
23,
24-0,
chairman
mcclellan
says
apparently,
“the
prosecutor
screening
process
is
in
fact
having
a
healthy
effect
on
the
number
of
orders
applied
for
and
thus
granted.
indeed,
it
appears
that
a
majority
of
the
167
applications
that
were
approved
for
submission
to
the
new
york
courts
were
not
approved
in
their
original
form.”
he
states
also,
“i
would
suggest
that
the
application
should
be
more
complete
on
their
face.
our
thought
was
that
mandating
prosecutor
involvement
in
the
warrant
process
which
strengthened
it
by
guarantying
that
that
decision
to
use
these
techniques
would
be
preceded
by
a
careful
law
enforcement
screening
process.
apparently,
this
practice
is
being
meaningfully
followed
in
the
majority
of
cases.”
he
further
states,
“prosecutors
on
whom
the
administration
of
the
statute
rests
heavily
should
always
carefully
prepare
and
review
these
applications
in
light
of
the
law.
what
may
have
been
permissible
under
old
practice
is
not
necessarily
legal
now.
i
hope
too
that
our
judiciary
even
with
crowded
dockets
is
always
taking
the
necessary
time
to
examine
and
pass
on
all
applications
thoroughly.
the
part
they
must
play
in
scrutinizing
and
questioning
these
applications
as
well
as
requiring
strict
adherence
to
the
statutory
standards
cannot
be
over
emphasized.”
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
haven’t
your
honor,
i
found
it
just
the
other
day.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
i
will
your
honor.
i’ll
file
this
as
a
supplement
to
the
brief.
chairman
mcclellan
goes
on,
“i
realize
too
that
we’re
dealing
with
a
new
reporting
system
as
well
as
new
legislation
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
overly
critical.
i
do
however
want
to
admonish
every
law
enforcement
officer,
prosecutor
and
judge
involved
in
this
area
that
the
only
way
this
legislation
will
be
effective
in
combating
crime
is
by
strict
adherence
to
the
standards
it
contains.”
and
he
further
stated
later
that,
“my
purpose
in
making
these
remarks
has
been
to
help
assure
that
this
legislation
will
be
in
fact
followed
to
the
strictest
letter
of
the
law,
both
bringing
criminals
to
book
and
protecting
citizen’s
privacy.
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
it
can
be
utilized
as
an
efficient
tool
in
reducing
crime.”
he
states
as
i’ve
indicated,
“my
only
concern
at
the
moment
is
that
the
prosecutors
in
the
courts
that
has
a
responsibility
under
the
statute
would
not
become
careless,
but
will
remain
firm
in
their
determination
to
see
that
the
statute
is
strictly
followed.
if
the
statute
is
strictly
followed,
it
is
certainly
not
to
be
expected
that
any
unnecessary
invasion
of
privacy
will
result.”
i
think
this
is
the
undercurrent
--
that
underlies
this
legislation
is
that
there
are
these
strict
requirements.
these
important
decisions
by
prosecuting
officers
are
an
integral
part
of
the
scheme
to
set
in
motion
a
rather
unique
modern
type
of
invasion
of
a
citizen’s
privacy.
so
i
would
say
your
honors
that
if
the
decision
of
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
either
the
attorney
general
or
the
assistant
attorney
general
is
important
and
the
information
concerning
who
made
that
decision
is
of
equal
crucial
importance.
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
decision
in
chavez
relied
solely
upon
section
28
--
2518
which
is
the
deficiency
of
the
order,
in
effect
holding
that
order
that
misidentifies
the
approving
officer
is
the
same
as
an
order
that
would
leave
that
information
blank,
and
therefore,
it
would
be
defective
on
its
face.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
chavez
is
affirmed,
of
course,
that
would
take
care
of
the
giordano
matter
as
well,
since
not
withstanding
whether
mr.
lindenbaum
was
or
was
not
authorized
if
the
--
as
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
chavez,
if
the
order
itself
is
defective
and
thereby
vitiating
the
entire
validity
of
the
wiretap,
then
both
chavez
and
giordano
will
fall
accordingly
and
that
would
be
our
protective
position
with
respect
to
the
second
prong,
the
chavez
prong
of
the
argument.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
i
think
pen
registers
have
been
held
not
to
be
a
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor,
i
think
the
statutory
scheme
for
pen
registers
is
adequate
in
this
particular
case.
they
were
not
the
subject
of
the
motion
--
they
were
the
subject
to
the
motion
of
suppress
in
the
district
court
but
were
not
before
the
court
of
appeals
necessarily
as
an
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals.
our
--
the
decision
in
chavez
parallels
the
district
court
decision
in
giordano
under
the
name
focarelli
(ph)
where
the
district
judge
in
giordano
took
the
position
that
the
orders
itself
were
invalid
and
therefore
the
tap
was
initiated.
this
reasoning
was
adopted
in
chavez
which
was
considered
with
the
king
case
which
applied
the
same
reasoning
as
before
the
court
in
giordano
in
these
pair
of
cases.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it’s
a
little
unclear.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
and
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
think
judge
duniway
was
considering
that
probably
it
applied
to
both
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
--
both
unlawfully
intercepted
and
perhaps
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
--
valid
on
its
face.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
two.
i
would
disagree
with
my
co-counsel
or
associate,
mr.
smouse
to
one
extent.
i
think
perhaps
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
the
statute
was
not
broad
enough
to
cover
this,
certainly
there
would
be
an
inherent
power
on
the
part
of
this
court
to
remedy
this
by
fashioning
a
supervisory
rule.
i
think
even
though
not
--
even
though
there’s
no
constitutional
point
involved,
i
would
see
no
prohibition
on
this
court
in
excluding
this
evidence
on
the
basis
that
there
must
be
some
sanction
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
strict
statutory
requirements.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
it
was
the
intent
that
2518
(10)
are
pretty
much
set
forth
those
grounds
upon
which
traditional
search
and
seizure
concepts
have
led
to
the
suppression
of
evidence
and
here
in
a
situation
like
this,
a
search
warrant
affidavit
that
had
this
same
defects,
a
misidentification
of
the
affiant
certainly
if
the
court
has
the
inherent
power
to
suppress
that,
the
same
rationale
should
apply
to
the
orders
and
the
application
[voice

mr.
james
f.
hewitt
a
search
warrant
affidavit
that
misidentifies
the
affiant.
the
case
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor,
some
type
of
supervisory
rule
that
would
--
that
would
get
the
--
some
sanction
for
non-compliance.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
i
think
the
statute
covers
it,
but
i’m
not
sure
that
that
would
be
crucial
to
uphold
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
they
were
not
that
clear
as
to
the
rationale
for
the
suppression,
but
certainly
i
think
it's
implicit
and
judge
duniway’s
opinion
that
this
type
of
conduct
is
in
conflict
with
the
legislative
history
and
certainly
in
conflict
with
the
clear
statutory
language
and
there
must
be
some
sanction
for
its
violation.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
the
judges
would
be
freer
in
this
case
because
they
can
interpret
the
statute
unlawfully
intercepted
in
a
broad
fashion
to
include
those
same
traditional
defects
that
the
court
would
consider
defect
--
consider
controlling
in
a
typical
search
and
seizure.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
while
the
issues
in
chavez
involve
both
types
of
wiretaps
here,
the
sol
lindenbaum
approved
tap
and
the
john
mitchell
approved
tap,
since
this
court
granted
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
limited
to
the
issue
of
the
tap
purportedly
approved
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
chavez
decision
which
based
the
decision
as
to
that
tap
solely
upon
the
application
of
2518,
i’ll
try
and
limit
my
remarks
to
that
aspect
to
this
total
problem,
but
there
maybe
some
overlapping
of
necessity.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
issue
is
important
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
involves
a
very
important
question
of
congressional
intent
in
the
enactment
of
this
legislation
that
affects
the
very
sensitive
area
in
this
modern
electronic
age.
and
secondly,
the
important
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
compliance
by
the
justice
department
with
this
mandate
of
congress
which
surrounds
virtually
this
authorization
to
engage
in
these
authorized
wiretaps.
it’s
obvious
i
think
from
the
legislative
history
and
certainly
from
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
institutional
decision
was
of
some
concern
to
congress.
mr.
justice
marshal
asked
the
question
of
how
often
do
these
institutional
decisions
happen
and
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
they
happen
often
enough
over
the
history
of
our
justice
department
that
congress
was
concerned
about
it
and
wanted
to
make
sure
that
these
wiretap
applications
would
not
be
the
subject
of
institutional
decisions,
they
would
not
be
rubber
stamped
and
they
would
not
be
handled
by
a
subordinate
members
of
the
justice
department
no
matter
how
knowledgeable
nor
how
responsible
they
might
be
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
legislative
history
is
clear,
that
congress
wanted
a
responsible
high
ranking
department
official
to
make
these
decisions
and
recognizing
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
conceivably
review
and
make
these
important
decisions
in
every
case,
he
was
empowered
to
designate
an
assistant
attorney
general,
a
specifically
identifiable
officer
within
the
department
to
act
on
these
applications
and
make
this
decisions
on
his
behalf.
now,
the
purpose
of
this
was
obviously
to
fix
responsibility
on
this
identifiable
person
so
that
in
later
years
or
should
a
wiretap
become
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion,
or
abuse
of
prosecuted
discretion,
that
congress
and
the
public
and
the
courts
could
put
their
finger
on
that
responsible
individual
and
point
the
finger
--
the
responsibility
to
him.
and
for
that
reason,
congress
made
a
rather
unique
provision
in
the
statute
that
he
be
identified
with
particularity
not
only
in
the
application
but
in
the
court
order
itself.
that
he’d
be
identified
in
the
reports
that
the
district
judge
must
make
within
10
days
after
the
completion
of
the
wiretap.
that
he’d
be
identified
by
the
administrative
officer
of
courts
and
the
annual
report
of
the
director
and
the
annual
report
of
the
judicial
conference,
so
that
this
particular
individual
must
be
identified
throughout
the
entire
reporting
scheme
as
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
wiretap
which
bears
his
name.
and
of
course,
the
way
to
get
this
information
is
to
have
him
set
forth
with
accurate
particularity
in
the
application
and
the
order.
now,
the
statutory
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
represent
the
respondents
in
chavez,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i’m
appointed
to
represent
the
respondent
apodaca
but
i’m
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
other
respondents
also.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that’s
correct
your
honor.
he
is
the
only
one
i
was
appointed
by
the
district
court
to
represent.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
correspondence
in
the
file
from
some
of
the
other
counsels
to
that
effect.
the
statute
sets
forth
in
essence
a
broader,
a
broader
set
of
requirements
than
are
customarily
have
found
in
the
search
warrants.
it
sets
forth
that
there
must
be
a
finding
of
need
for
the
wiretap.
there
must
be
a
finding
of
probable
cause
and
there
must
be
this
important
prosecutor
decision
by
this
responsible
officer.
the
mere
fact
that
the
district
judge
need
not
pass
upon
the
propriety
of
the
prosecuted
decision
of
the
responsible
officer,
doesn’t
make
it
any
less
and
important
prong
of
this
protective
device
that
congress
setup
within
the
statutory
scheme.
the
court
does
have
to
find
a
need
for
the
wiretap
and
that
other
methods
are
unlikely
to
succeed
if
tried
and
must
find
probable
cause,
but
the
court
relying
upon
the
representations
in
the
papers
presented
to
it,
must
assume
that
a
proper
prosecutor
determination
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
justifies
this
gross
intrusion
has
been
made
and
find
that
it
has
been
made
by
a
responsible
officer
as
named
in
the
statute
and
this
is
where
the
courts
were
misled
in
this
particular
case.
now,
the
government
doesn’t
seem
to
feel
that’s
a
particularly
important
factor
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor
because
the
statute
wasn’t
complied
with
if
the
wrong
person
was
placed
in.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it
is
unnecessary,
but
it
certainly
makes
the
violation
certainly
more
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
we
would
your
honor.
and
as
a
result
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it
would
be
bad
your
honor
because
it
identifies
the
wrong
person.
when
in
later
years
someone
wishes
to
put
the
finger
of
responsibility
for
the
chavez
wiretap,
they
would
go
to
the
records
of
the
court,
the
records
of
the
administrative
office
and
wilson
would
be
the
party
responsible.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
they
might
say,
“wilson
how
dare
you
authorize
this
improper
wiretap.”
mr.
wilson
will
say,
“i
didn’t
sign
that
letter,
it
was
signed
by
one
of
my
subordinates.”
this
is
exactly
what
congress
wanted
to
prevent.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
this
is
the
position
in
the
chavez
case
your
honor,
that
pretty
much
the
status
of
the
facts.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
because
the
order
must
identify
the
person
who
actually
approved
the
wiretap.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
it
must
identify
the
proper
person.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
so
that
this
accurate
information
can
you
might
say
be
disseminated
to
the
interested
parties,
congress
and
the
public
and
certainly
the
district
judge
who
makes
the
determination.
because
of
this
false
letter,
because
of
this
letter
bearing
someone
else’s
signature
purporting
to
be
will
wilson
and
purporting
to
state
in
the
body
of
the
letter
that
wilson
reviewed
this
file,
that
he
carefully
looked
at
it,
that
he
determined
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
requires
a
wiretap,
that
i
found
probable
cause,
i
found
that
other
needs,
i
apply
my
experience
and
my
position
as
assistant
attorney
general
and
i
make
this
important
decision.
he
represents
this
in
the
letter
that
wasn’t
even
signed
by
him.
as
a
result
of
that,
a
false
application
is
made
to
the
district
court.
the
determination
the
district
judge
makes
to
order
the
wiretap,
to
authorize
it
as
based
upon
a
false
representation.
false
information
is
incorporated
into
the
court
order
which
the
judge
signs
in
this
file.
it
causes
the
district
judge
to
make
a
false
report
to
the
administrative
office
that
wilson
had
authorized
this
tap.
it
causes
the
administrative
office
to
make
a
false
report
in
its
annual
report
which
is
subject
to
public
scrutiny.
the
entire
scheme
is
false
because
this
letter
is
not
true.
will
wilson
was
not
designated
to
authorize
the
tap
nor
did
he
ever
see
the
file.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
if
the
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
and
for
this
reason
your
honor.
nowhere
in
this
case
does
john
mitchell
say
that
he
ever
saw
this
file,
that
he
ever
reviewed
or
he
did
more
than
authorize
it.
will
wilson
says,
“i
have
carefully
reviewed
the
file.
i
had
exercised
my
discretion.
i
make
this
finding,
i
make
that
finding,
i’m
satisfied.”
if
mr.
mitchell
signed
this
letter
saying,
“i
personally
as
attorney
general
have
reviewed
this
file
and
made
these
determinations
then
i
think
the
district
judge
must
rely
upon
those
determinations.”
but
here,
the
district
judge
rightfully
and
justifiably
believed
that
these
decisions
were
made
by
will
wilson,
the
assistant
attorney
general
who
says
he
reviewed
the
file
and
made
these
important
decisions.
and
this
is
simply,
i
urge
your
honors,
it
isn’t
simply
the
finding
of
probable
cause
indeed.
i
think
the
prosecuted
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
the
type
of
case
that
justifies
a
wiretap
is
a
very
important
one
and
i
think
the
legislative
scheme
shows
that
there
was
not
to
be
a
rubber
stamp,
a
blanket
authority
to
tap
any
telephone.
only
those
phones
that
the
attorney
general
or
a
responsible
designated
assistant
finds
to
justify
this
intrusion
maybe
used
and
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
important
decisions
that
the
district
judge
was
misled
on
as
to
who
might
have
made
that
decision.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
that’s
not
a
particularly
important
facet
to
the
statutory
scheme
and
i
would
submit
to
you
your
honors
that
it
is
very
important.
that
it's
important
in
the
sense
that
from
the
congressional
record
on
august
11,
1969,
chairman
mcclellan
summarized
the
first
year
of
operation
unto
the
omnibus
crime
bill
and
he
stated
that
apparently,
and
i
call
the
courts
attention
to
page
23,
24-0,
chairman
mcclellan
says
apparently,
“the
prosecutor
screening
process
is
in
fact
having
a
healthy
effect
on
the
number
of
orders
applied
for
and
thus
granted.
indeed,
it
appears
that
a
majority
of
the
167
applications
that
were
approved
for
submission
to
the
new
york
courts
were
not
approved
in
their
original
form.”
he
states
also,
“i
would
suggest
that
the
application
should
be
more
complete
on
their
face.
our
thought
was
that
mandating
prosecutor
involvement
in
the
warrant
process
which
strengthened
it
by
guarantying
that
that
decision
to
use
these
techniques
would
be
preceded
by
a
careful
law
enforcement
screening
process.
apparently,
this
practice
is
being
meaningfully
followed
in
the
majority
of
cases.”
he
further
states,
“prosecutors
on
whom
the
administration
of
the
statute
rests
heavily
should
always
carefully
prepare
and
review
these
applications
in
light
of
the
law.
what
may
have
been
permissible
under
old
practice
is
not
necessarily
legal
now.
i
hope
too
that
our
judiciary
even
with
crowded
dockets
is
always
taking
the
necessary
time
to
examine
and
pass
on
all
applications
thoroughly.
the
part
they
must
play
in
scrutinizing
and
questioning
these
applications
as
well
as
requiring
strict
adherence
to
the
statutory
standards
cannot
be
over
emphasized.”
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
haven’t
your
honor,
i
found
it
just
the
other
day.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
i
will
your
honor.
i’ll
file
this
as
a
supplement
to
the
brief.
chairman
mcclellan
goes
on,
“i
realize
too
that
we’re
dealing
with
a
new
reporting
system
as
well
as
new
legislation
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
overly
critical.
i
do
however
want
to
admonish
every
law
enforcement
officer,
prosecutor
and
judge
involved
in
this
area
that
the
only
way
this
legislation
will
be
effective
in
combating
crime
is
by
strict
adherence
to
the
standards
it
contains.”
and
he
further
stated
later
that,
“my
purpose
in
making
these
remarks
has
been
to
help
assure
that
this
legislation
will
be
in
fact
followed
to
the
strictest
letter
of
the
law,
both
bringing
criminals
to
book
and
protecting
citizen’s
privacy.
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
it
can
be
utilized
as
an
efficient
tool
in
reducing
crime.”
he
states
as
i’ve
indicated,
“my
only
concern
at
the
moment
is
that
the
prosecutors
in
the
courts
that
has
a
responsibility
under
the
statute
would
not
become
careless,
but
will
remain
firm
in
their
determination
to
see
that
the
statute
is
strictly
followed.
if
the
statute
is
strictly
followed,
it
is
certainly
not
to
be
expected
that
any
unnecessary
invasion
of
privacy
will
result.”
i
think
this
is
the
undercurrent
--
that
underlies
this
legislation
is
that
there
are
these
strict
requirements.
these
important
decisions
by
prosecuting
officers
are
an
integral
part
of
the
scheme
to
set
in
motion
a
rather
unique
modern
type
of
invasion
of
a
citizen’s
privacy.
so
i
would
say
your
honors
that
if
the
decision
of
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
either
the
attorney
general
or
the
assistant
attorney
general
is
important
and
the
information
concerning
who
made
that
decision
is
of
equal
crucial
importance.
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
decision
in
chavez
relied
solely
upon
section
28
--
2518
which
is
the
deficiency
of
the
order,
in
effect
holding
that
order
that
misidentifies
the
approving
officer
is
the
same
as
an
order
that
would
leave
that
information
blank,
and
therefore,
it
would
be
defective
on
its
face.
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
chavez
is
affirmed,
of
course,
that
would
take
care
of
the
giordano
matter
as
well,
since
not
withstanding
whether
mr.
lindenbaum
was
or
was
not
authorized
if
the
--
as
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
chavez,
if
the
order
itself
is
defective
and
thereby
vitiating
the
entire
validity
of
the
wiretap,
then
both
chavez
and
giordano
will
fall
accordingly
and
that
would
be
our
protective
position
with
respect
to
the
second
prong,
the
chavez
prong
of
the
argument.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
i
think
pen
registers
have
been
held
not
to
be
a
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor,
i
think
the
statutory
scheme
for
pen
registers
is
adequate
in
this
particular
case.
they
were
not
the
subject
of
the
motion
--
they
were
the
subject
to
the
motion
of
suppress
in
the
district
court
but
were
not
before
the
court
of
appeals
necessarily
as
an
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals.
our
--
the
decision
in
chavez
parallels
the
district
court
decision
in
giordano
under
the
name
focarelli
(ph)
where
the
district
judge
in
giordano
took
the
position
that
the
orders
itself
were
invalid
and
therefore
the
tap
was
initiated.
this
reasoning
was
adopted
in
chavez
which
was
considered
with
the
king
case
which
applied
the
same
reasoning
as
before
the
court
in
giordano
in
these
pair
of
cases.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it’s
a
little
unclear.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
and
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
i
think
judge
duniway
was
considering
that
probably
it
applied
to
both
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
--
both
unlawfully
intercepted
and
perhaps
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
--
valid
on
its
face.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
two.
i
would
disagree
with
my
co-counsel
or
associate,
mr.
smouse
to
one
extent.
i
think
perhaps
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
the
statute
was
not
broad
enough
to
cover
this,
certainly
there
would
be
an
inherent
power
on
the
part
of
this
court
to
remedy
this
by
fashioning
a
supervisory
rule.
i
think
even
though
not
--
even
though
there’s
no
constitutional
point
involved,
i
would
see
no
prohibition
on
this
court
in
excluding
this
evidence
on
the
basis
that
there
must
be
some
sanction
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
strict
statutory
requirements.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
it
was
the
intent
that
2518
(10)
are
pretty
much
set
forth
those
grounds
upon
which
traditional
search
and
seizure
concepts
have
led
to
the
suppression
of
evidence
and
here
in
a
situation
like
this,
a
search
warrant
affidavit
that
had
this
same
defects,
a
misidentification
of
the
affiant
certainly
if
the
court
has
the
inherent
power
to
suppress
that,
the
same
rationale
should
apply
to
the
orders
and
the
application
[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
a
search
warrant
affidavit
that
misidentifies
the
affiant.
the
case
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor,
some
type
of
supervisory
rule
that
would
--
that
would
get
the
--
some
sanction
for
non-compliance.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
i
think
the
statute
covers
it,
but
i’m
not
sure
that
that
would
be
crucial
to
uphold
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
they
were
not
that
clear
as
to
the
rationale
for
the
suppression,
but
certainly
i
think
it's
implicit
and
judge
duniway’s
opinion
that
this
type
of
conduct
is
in
conflict
with
the
legislative
history
and
certainly
in
conflict
with
the
clear
statutory
language
and
there
must
be
some
sanction
for
its
violation.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
the
judges
would
be
freer
in
this
case
because
they
can
interpret
the
statute
unlawfully
intercepted
in
a
broad
fashion
to
include
those
same
traditional
defects
that
the
court
would
consider
defect
--
consider
controlling
in
a
typical
search
and
seizure.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
your
honor.
thank
you.
