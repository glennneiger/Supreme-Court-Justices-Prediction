justice
potter
stewart
what
if
he
hadn’t
approved
that
after
he
got
back
from
a
month's
trip?
justice
potter
stewart
the
interception
would
have
taken
place.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
also
the
court,
not
have
determined
it,
that
the
--
that
will
wilson
had
approved
it
too
when
he
hadn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
will
wilson
had
been
specifically
designated
and
had
in
fact
approved
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
a
fact
it
would
have
been
approved
by
under
my
hypothetical
case
by
mr.
lindenbaum
who
was
orally
authorized
to
do
it
and
but
then
on
the
return
of
the
attorney
general
had
been
disapproved.
justice
potter
stewart
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
mr.
will
wilson?
justice
potter
stewart
it
turned
out
that
your
department,
hasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
the
facts
are
that
will
wilson
never
authorized
one
of
these
and
never
signed
the
letter.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
one
or
the
other
--
the
deputies
would
put
his
signature
on
it
with
a
rubber
stamp
or
make
some
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
or
write
out
his
name
as
over
his
signature?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
attorney
general
had
authorized?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
a
communication
from
the
attorney
general
to
attorney
general
wilson.
justice
potter
stewart
are
those
neutrally
exclusive
or
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
2518
can,
the
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
three,
no
court
has
held
the
three,
isn’t
out
here?
justice
potter
stewart
probably
there
are
good
many
other
provisions
in
the
statute
which
are
restrictions
and
limitations
and
conditions
limiting
the
circumstances
under
which
wiretapping
can
be
or
--
can
be
lawfully
carried
on
in
addition
to
the
ones
we’re
talking
about
here.
for
example,
let’s
take
for
example
18
united
states
code
2518
(1)
(c),
the
exhaustion
requirements
as
i
think
about
it,
i
would
--
do
you
have
to
--
there
has
to
be
a
statement
to
the
court
that
all
other
reasonable
means
have
been
tried
and
have
failed
or
have
an
explanation
of
why
they
had
not
been.
now,
let’s
say
that
that
was
put
in
conclusionary
form
that
looked
all
right
to
the
court
but
turned
out
to
be
absolutely
false,
concededly
false
that
no
effort
had
been
made
and
no
other
effort.
this
was
just
a
lazy
person
who
wanted
to
intercept
the
telephone
conversations.
what
do
--
wouldn’t
your
argument
mean
that
that
--
there
would
be
no
sanction
for
that
either.
there
could
be
suppression
because
that’s
not
constitutional
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’m
talking
about
--
i’m
really
not
talking
about
supervisory
powers.
well,
i’m
talking
about
the
meaning
of
2518
(10)
(a)
(1)
that
the
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted
and
then
your
point
as
i
gather
it
is
that
unlawfully
means
unconstitutionally.
that
may
oversimplify
your
point,
but
that’s
basically
it,
as
i
gather
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
just
had
been
exhausted
although
he
said
he
did
but
that
--
then
it
became
clear
--
justice
potter
stewart
one
or
another
that
he
hadn’t.
let's
say
he
was
in
good
faith.
if
he
thought
he’d
had
exhausted,
he
read
this
and
he
looked
out
at
it,
he
said
any
fellows,
eyewitnesses
to
that
crime
and
nobody
was
and
he
thought
that
was
enough
of
an
exhaustion.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
thought
your
argument
would
lead
to.
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
i
understand
that
but
--
so
your
point
really
is
that
unlawfully
means
unconstitutionally,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
may
apply
2518
(10)
(a)
(1).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
question
was
directed
to
one,
to
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
or
you
must
lead
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
get
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
that
otherwise
have
--
wouldn’t
and
could’ve
had
issued.
justice
potter
stewart
knowingly.
justice
potter
stewart
what
were
these
--
what
are
the
sanctions
then?
what
is
the
sanction
for
it?
this
–
that's
assuming
and
i
know
you
don’t
concede
but
let’s
assume
that
these
were
violations
of
the
statute.
what
are
the
sanctions?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
congress
has
enacted
this
law
and
said
what
they’d
wanted
to
take
place.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
congress
has
done
its
job.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
congress
here
wasn’t
concerned
really
with
the
--
with
good
faith.
it
was
primarily
concerned
with
limiting
the
conditions
and
circumstances
under
which
there
could
be
a
wiretap
or
a
wire
interception.
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
are
just
dead
letters
that
if
there’s
no
sanction.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
they’re
--
even
if
the
violations
are
in
all
good
faith,
whether
the
violations
of
the
kind
involved
in
the
cases
now
before
us
or
the
violation
of
the
kind
that
i
suggested
under
2510,
whatever
it
is
--
2518
(1)
(a)
--
(1)
(c),
no
exhaustion,
congress
said
there
cannot
be
even
if
it
should
--
must
not
be
wire
interceptions
until
all
other
means
have
failed
for
example
and
under
your
view,
they're
--
they're
just
--
will
continue
to
be
such
interceptions
if
you
get
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
means
these
words
are
just
precatory?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
--
your
argument
is
the
statute
would
not
have
been
--
it
would
not
be
under
a
one
or
two?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
or
three?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
it
would
have
been
an
unconstitutional
tap?
justice
potter
stewart
with
an
insufficient
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
would
be
very
convincing
if
the
sta
--
if
this
statute
now
before
us
had
simply
said
the
attorney
general.
but
when
it
adds
or
any
assistant
attorney
general
specially
designated
by
the
attorney
general
does
detract
from
the
argument
that
there’s
an
inherent
delegation
of
authority
to
delegate
to
other
people.
justice
potter
stewart
alter
ego.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
of
the
--
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was,
we’ve
just
--
we’ve
just
--
while
you’re
already
interrupted,
you
said
that
all
of
these
courts
with
the
exceptions
you’ve
now
noticed
--
noted
have
decreed
suppression.
have
all
of
them
without
exception
relied
on
2518
(10)
(a)
or
have
they
done
it
in
the
exercise
of
--
the
purported
exercise
with
some
supervisory
power?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they’ve
held,
more
accurately
they’ve
held
that
the
statute
compels
suppression,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
you
rely
on
the
2518
(10)
(a)
(1)
or
(2)
or
i
guess
the
answer
is
you
rely
on
both?
justice
potter
stewart
(2)
and
now
the
district
court
in
terms
of
(1),
wasn’t
it
[voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
in
burger
or
katz
that
i
can
remember,
you
tell
me
if
i’m
wrong,
said
that
in
a
federal
case,
the
attorney
general
or
some
specially
designated
assistant
attorney
general
had
to
approve
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don’t
suggest
that
anything
in
the
constitution
requires
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
take
it
as
[voice

justice
potter
stewart
were
there
pen
registers
involved
in
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
they
require
as
i
understand
that
all
that
they
reveal
is
the
numbers
called
from
a
particular
phone?
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
are
--
on
the
other
hand
that
you
needed
the
cover
by
the
constitution
in
the
fourth
amendment,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
to
suppress
what,
if
the
court
has
the
power?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
--
but
you're
suggesting
that
some
kind
of
a
mcnabb-mallory
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
we
find
its
--
this
isn’t
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
he
hadn’t
approved
that
after
he
got
back
from
a

justice

the
