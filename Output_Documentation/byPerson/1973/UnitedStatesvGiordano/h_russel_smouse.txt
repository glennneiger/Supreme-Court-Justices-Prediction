mr.
h.
russel
smouse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
giordano
case
the
court
has
confronted
with
compounded
violations
of
title
iii,
specifically
sections
2516
(1)
and
2518
(1)
(a)
and
(4)
(d).
as
for
the
section
2516
point,
the
fact
is
that
on
october
16,
1970,
francis
s.
brocato,
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
for
the
district
of
maryland
submitted
to
chief
judge
northrop
of
the
united
state
district
court
for
maryland,
an
application
for
an
order
authorizing
the
interception
of
wire
communications
on
the
telephone
of
my
client,
dominic
nicholas
giordano.
attached
to
the
application
as
exhibits
were
a
“will
wilson
letter”
to
mr.
brocato
and
the
affidavits
of
two
agents
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs.
the
will
wilson
letter
evidences
the
fact
that
mr.
brocato
had
requested
authorization
to
apply
for
the
wiretap
order,
this
request
having
been
made
to
then
attorney
general
john
n.
mitchell.
although
the
request
had
been
directed
to
the
attorney
general,
the
record
submitted
in
this
case
shows
that
it
never
was
reviewed
by
the
attorney
general
himself,
but
that
his
initials
had
been
placed
on
the
authorization
memorandum
by
mr.
sol
lindenbaum,
his
executive
assistant.
this
authorization
memorandum
had
then
been
dispatched
to
assistant
attorney
general
will
wilson
or
the
office
of
assistant
attorney
general
will
wilson
purportedly
designating
mr.
wilson
to
authorize
the
application
to
be
presented
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
the
record
in
this
case
and
in
the
case
of
murder
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
held
before
judge
merchants
(ph)
in
the
southern
district
of
florida,
evidences
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
had
never
specially
designated
any
of
his
assistant
attorneys
general
to
issue
wiretap
authorizations.
it
is
also
uncontested
that
the
will
wilson
letters
indeed
were
never
signed
by
mr.
wilson,
not
in
this
case
nor
indeed
in
any
of
the
host
of
cases
which
have
arisen
in
this
series
of
litigation.
there
was
subsequent
to
the
application
for
a
wiretap
order,
application
for
an
extension
order
dated
november
6,
1970,
some
21
days
after
the
original
application.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
indicated
perhaps
some
seven
days
after
the
original
application,
the
attorney
general
had
become
familiar
with
the
operative
facts.
the
affidavit
of
mr.
lindenbaum
indicates
that
some
21
days
later,
the
attorney
general
authorized
the
application
for
an
extension.
included
within
that
application
for
extension
was
another
will
wilson
letter
and
an
additional
affidavit
from
agent
abraham
azaon
(ph)
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs.
on
review
of
the
azaon
affidavit,
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
operative
facts
setting
forth
probable
cause
are
those
investigative
details
and
intelligence
which
developed
pursuant
to
the
original
wiretap.
the
government
i
believe
in
its
brief
indicates
that
the
azaon
application
reasserts
the
facts
that
was
set
forth
in
the
original
application,
indeed,
they
do
not.
it
merely
states
i
reassert
without
specifying
what
those
facts
were,
the
fact
set
forth
in
the
original
application,
indeed,
it
is
an
incorporation
by
reference
type
approach.
i
would
ask
this
honorable
court
to
look
critically
at
the
particular
facts
in
the
case
at
hand
as
indeed
i
suspect
they
are
at
perhaps
some
variance
from
the
facts
which
the
government
indicates
in
its
brief
developed
at
some
subsequent
point
in
time
with
regard
to
checking
with
the
attorney
general
and
apprising
him
of
the
facts
after
the
fact.
as
for
the
section
2518
point,
it
must
be
noted
that
not
only
did
mr.
wilson
not
sign
the
letter,
he
indeed
never
saw
any
of
the
papers
in
this
case
nor
indeed
did
the
attorney
general
prior
to
the
application
for
the
extension
order.
mr.
wilson
testified
as
i
indicated
before
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
in
the
marder
case,
at
which
time
he
stated
he
did
not
know
that
the
will
wilson
letter
was
being
submitted
to
united
state
district
courts
around
the
country.
in
fact,
he
testified
the
“did
not
know
exactly
what
was
made
of
them.”
he
did
not
know
that
mr.
lindenbaum
was
signing
the
attorney
generals
initials
to
authorization
memos.
he
did
not
know
that
anyone
other
than
the
attorney
general,
in
fact,
was
authorizing
wiretaps.
i
would
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
this
suggests
a
rather
amazing
lack
of
communication
within
the
department
of
justice.
this
incredibly
loose
procedure
led
the
late
judge
sobeloff
to
conclude
in
his
opinion
below
and
i
quote
“if
judge
northrop
had
been
aware
of
the
real
status
of
the
application,
that
neither
mitchell
nor
wilson
even
knew
of
it
and
that
the
application
had
been
approved
and
initialed
jnm
by
lindenbaum,
we
are
certain
that
he
would
have
refused
to
permit
the
wiretap.”
the
sequence
of
events
here
involve
i
submit
constitutes
the
“elaborate
paper
charade”
which
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
condemned
in
the
king
case.
it
is
significant
that
where
the
violations
herein
question
have
been
shown
to
exist
in
combination,
the
vast
majority
of
federal
courts
have
found
a
violation
of
2516
and
have
decreed
suppression
as
the
remedy.
in
addition
to
the
giordano
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
there
is
the
opinion
of
course
of
the
robinson
court
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
per
curiam
opinion
in
the
robert’s
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
king
case
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
mantello
case.
in
addition,
to
the
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
the
pisacano
case
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
second
circuit
which
was
later
followed
although
i
must
say
i
don’t
feel
embraced
by
the
opinion
in
the
becker
case,
judge
friendly
wrote
--
chief
judge
friendly
wrote
the
opinion
in
pisacano,
judge
mansfield
wrote
the
becker
opinion.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
the
second
circuit,
is
the
only
circuit
that
i
am
aware
of
mr.
justice
brennan
to
the
contrary.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
it
did
mr.
justice,
not
en
banc.
it
was
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
after
the
en
banc
hearing.
it
went
back
to
the
southern
district
of
florida.
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
conducted
in
the
marder
case
and
i
gather
the
case
is
now
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
again.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
the
original
opinion
resulted
in
a
petition
for
rehearing.
rehearing
was
conducted
en
banc,
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
the
southern
district
of
florida
in
the
marder
case.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
in
reliance
on
2515
and
2518
(10)
(a).
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
is
precisely
correct.
in
addition
to
the
circuits
which
have
so
held,
a
number
of
district
courts
in
other
circuits,
specifically
two
courts
i
believe
in
the
third
circuit
and
courts
in
the
sixth
circuit
have
ruled
in
like
manner.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
yes
your
honor,
we
feel
that
the
remedy
here
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
we
feel
that
title
iii
is
self
executing
as
to
remedy.
the
robert’s
courts
speaks
of
the
persuasive
reason
--
reasoning
of
judge
sobeloff
in
giordano.
indeed
giordano
seems
to
be
the
case
most
frequently
looked
to
for
guidance,
most
frequently
cited
and
whose
language
is
most
frequently
adopted
by
other
courts.
the
court’s
have
with
overwhelming
consistency
really
viewed
the
2516
defect
as
a
substantial
violation.
with
this
background
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
section
2516
with
the
rationale
for
that
section
and
speak
to
the
government’s
contentions
concerning
the
section.
judge
sobeloff
in
his
opinion
below
effectively
lays
to
rest
the
alter
ego
theory
which
has
with
recurring
predictability
been
advanced
by
the
government.
judge
sobeloff
stating
in
pertinent
part,
“the
alter
ego
theory
is
open
ended.
it
need
not
stop
with
lindenbaum
but
could
be
extended
with
an
equal
claim
of
validity
to
anyone
within
or
without
the
department
of
justice.
in
determining
who
qualifies
as
an
alter
ego,
it
would
permit
side
stepping
the
congressional
mandate,
fixing
the
level
of
those
who
maybe
designated
to
authorize
applications.”
senate
report
1097
is
instructive
wherein
referring
to
section
2516
(1),
it
is
stated
and
i
quote
this
language
which
has
earlier
been
referred
to
by
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
but
which
i
feel
bears
repeating,
“this
provision
centralizes
in
a
publicly
responsible
officials
subject
to
the
political
process,
the
formulation
of
law
enforcement
policy
on
the
use
of
electronic
surveillance
techniques.
centralization
will
avoid
the
possibility
that
divergent
practices
might
develop,
should
abuses
occur,
the
lines
of
responsibility
lead
to
an
identifiable
person.”
the
legislative
history
of
course
speaks
to
identifiable
person
and
not
an
identifiable
office.
in
the
first
robinson
case,
the
court
after
noting
this
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
submit
it
does
not
your
honor.
identifiable
persons
speaks
of
that
individual
either
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
he
is
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
yes,
he
is
mr.
chief
justice,
the
attorney
general.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
i
submit
to
what
the
senate
reflects
in
this
legislative
history
is
that
they
are
speaking
though
of
the
person
either
in
the
position
of
attorney
general
or
one
of
his
assistant
attorneys
general
who
has
gone
through
the
process
of
senatorial
confirmation.
the
senate
obliged
to
exercise
this
degree
of
supervision
shall
we
say
or
restraint
over
exercise
of
the
awesome
power
of
wire
surveillance.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
cannot
speak
to
acting
assistants,
i’m
not
sure
that
they
receive,
they
have
gone
through
the
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
they
have
not
gone
through
the
confirmation
process
i
would
say
no
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
in
the
legislative
history,
actually
senate
report
1097,
where
it
speaks
to
official
subject
to
the
political
process
and
i
submit
that
means
the
confirmation
process,
that
is
the
rationale
really
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
robinson
case
wherein
that
court
noted
by
expressing
its
intention
that
only
a
publicly
responsible
official
subject
to
the
political
process
could
initiate
a
wiretap
application.
congress
wanted
to
make
certain
that
every
such
matter
would
have
the
personal
attention
of
an
individual
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
would
your
honor
unless
he
had
as
i
believe
mr.
clinding
has
been
confirmed,
i
believed
he
had
been
confirmed
as
deputy.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
he
has
been
tested
by
the
political
process.[laughter]
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
they
are
involved
in
the
political
process
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
but
they
have
not
been
senatorially
confirmed
and
i
feel
that
senate
meant
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
do
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
confirmation
is
what
the
senate
had
in
mind.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
they
do
not
say
it.
i
fell
that
is
inherent
in
the
language
of
the
legislative
history
and
i
feel
that
the
interpretation
placed
on
that
history
by
a
number
of
lower
courts
which
have
looked
to
the
problem
is
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
believe
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
a
stamp
of
approval
has
not
been
placed
on
them
by
the
senate
in
an
area
where
the
senate
wanted
great
care
exercise
in
the
authorization
of
wiretap
surveillance.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
would
easily
be
met
mr.
chief
justice
had
his
predecessor
designated
an
assistant
attorney
general
to
exercise
authorization
in
this
area
and
the
congress
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice,
i
feel
that
if
the
attorney
general
had
exercised
the
foresight
here
to
designate
the
man
chosen
to
head
the
criminal
division
to
authorize
wiretap
applications
obviously,
there
would
not
be
this
host
of
cases
before
the
courts.
provision
for
delegation
was
made
so
that
the
government
could
operate
in
an
effective
fashion
in
the
area
of
criminal
investigation
and
in
utilization
of
wire
surveillance.
it
merely
required
some
delegation
within
that
authorized
for
the
statute
and
easily
enough,
the
attorney
general
could
have
designated
one
his
assistants
and
the
acting
attorney
general
who
might
succeed
him
would
have
the
benefit
then
of
a
person
properly
designated.
this
honorable
court
in
gelbard
through
mr.
justice
brennan
writing
for
the
majority
made
the
following
significant
comment
concerning
title
iii
in
noting
that
act
sets
forth
and
i
quote,
“an
approval
that
may
not
be
given
except
upon
compliance
with
astringent
condition,”
citing
18
u.s.c.
2516
and
2518
(1)
through
(8)
obviously
and
admittedly
the
gelbard
case
did
not
involve
any
of
the
issues
here
before
the
court
but
i
feel
that
language
is
helpful
and
instructive.
the
courts
i
submit
in
the
better
reason
cases
speak
in
terms
of
2516
being
enacted
as
a
necessary
safeguard
as
expressed
in
the
following
language
in
king.
the
act
in
its
legislative
history
may
clear
the
purpose
of
the
authorization
requirement
2516
(1),
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
grave
threat
to
the
privacy
of
every
american
that
is
posed
by
modern
techniques
of
electronic
surveillance.
in
order
to
insure
circumspection
in
their
use,
congress
erected
the
elaborate
procedural
safeguards,
then
citing
2516.
and
as
earlier
been
noted,
the
language
of
the
statute
authorizing
but
limiting
the
delegation
evolved
from
the
testimony
of
then
assistant
attorney
general
miller,
head
of
the
criminal
division.
the
responsibility
theory
which
the
government
has
advanced
in
his
brief
in
this
case
in
which
forums,
the
underlying
rationale
of
pisacano,
we
submit
ignores
the
complete
legislative
history
and
ignores
the
specifically
limiting
language
of
section
2516
and
as
i
noted
before,
judge
mansfield
in
the
second
circuit
in
writing
in
becker
expressed
no
great
enthusiasm
for
the
pisacano
holding
where
he
stated,
“we
feel
bound
to
follow
pisacano
especially
since
it
is
so
recent
and
the
facts
before
the
court
are
indistinguishable.
our
adherents
to
the
law,
the
circuit
has
thus
established
is
not
to
be
considered
as
an
approval
of
the
procedure
followed
by
the
attorney
general
and
his
staff.”
with
regard
to
the
general
delegation
of
authority,
section
28
u.s.c.
section
510
would
submit
that
as
stated
in
our
brief,
normal
rules
of
statutory
construction
reject
the
applicability
of
that
general
delegation
of
authority.
section
2516
is
narrow,
specific
and
limited
in
terms.
moreover,
28
u.s.c.
section
510
was
in
existence
prior
to
the
enactment
of
title
iii.
the
fifth
circuit
in
robinson,
i
submit
properly
concluded
that
2516
(1)
was
intended
to
act
as
a
limit
upon
section
510.
concerning
the
remedy,
the
statute
itself
in
sections
2515
and
2518
(10)
(a)
(1)
and
(2)
mandates
the
remedy
and
it
should
be
noted
that
the
violation
here
is
of
considerable
dimension.
this
is
not
an
isolated
case,
not
an
incidental
slip
up.
from
the
host
of
cases
where
the
violations
herein
question
have
been
framed,
it
clearly
appears
that
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
disregard
to
the
statutory
safeguards
of
title
iii
in
the
area
of
authorization
and
identification
were
continuing
and
constantly
recurring
within
the
department
of
justice.
the
government
seems
to
espouse
this
applicable
--
the
standard
suggested
by
the
american
law
institute.
it's
footnoted
on
page
41
of
the
government’s
brief
where
it
is
proposed
that
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
be
determined
by
the
substantiality
of
the
infringement
involved.
while
as
i
noted
before,
we
submit
that
the
statute
itself
mandates
the
remedy
and
that
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
the
judicially
framed
exclusionary
rule
even
looking
at
the
test
espoused
by
the
government,
it
must
be
recognized
that
the
course
of
conduct
engaged
in
by
the
department
of
justice
forded
the
clear
requirements
of
title
iii
and
the
purpose
of
the
sections
in
question
and
the
violation
of
them
as
i
noted
before
was
recurring
and
if
quantum
of
impropriety
is
to
be
the
applicable
standard
in
this
case
then
i
submit
that
suppression
must
necessary
follow.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
would
rely
on
both
your
honor.
in
fact
judge
sobeloff
i
believe
spoke
in
terms
of
(2)
and
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
veckerelli
(ph)
case
turned
it,
yes
your
honor
that
is
correct,
actually
turned
on
the
2518
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
2516
violation.
we
submit
that,
actually,
what
the
government
here
proposes
is
that
this
honorable
court
ignored
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
the
government
moreover
seems
to
fail
to
acknowledge
the
enormity
of
the
violation
involved
and
turns
its
argument
or
its
approach
on
a
proposition
that
the
violations
in
question
are
not
central
to
fourth
amendment
values
and
so
sanction
should
be
something
less
and
suppression.
i
submit
that
neither
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
or
legislative
history
nor
judicial
interpretation
would
support
this
contention.
this
honorable
court
in
burger
spoke
in
terms
of
protective
procedures
in
the
area
of
eavesdropping
which
of
course
would
embrace
wire
surveillance,
so
as
to
ensure
the
protection
of
inherent
fourth
amendment
rights.
i
would
submit
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
the
right
of
conversational
privacy.
as
noted
in
scot,
title
iii
represents
the
effort
of
congress
to
meet
the
concerns
expressed
by
this
honorable
court
in
burger
and
katz
and
to
structure
a
limited
system
of
wire
surveillance
and
electronic
eavesdropping
within
the
framework
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
guidelines
of
burger
and
katz.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
they
have
changed
and
apparently
corrected
their

mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
is

mr.

stewart,
there
is
no
such
language
in

and

mr.
h.
russel
smouse

do

burger
as
the
court
well
knows
spoke
in
terms
of
protective
procedures.
your
honor,
i
believe
in
katz
spoke
in
terms
of
appropriate
safeguards.
congress
cognizant
of
this
express
concerned
by
this
court
for
the
need
to
embrace
protective
procedures,
framed
title
iii
in
an
effort
to
meet
those
concerns
and
to
meet
congressional
concern
over
a
limited
approach
in
this
area.
again,
if
i
may
borrow
from
the
language
of
judge
sobeloff,
rejecting
the
government
contention
that
suppression
would
be
inappropriate,
he
stated
and
i
quote,
“this
is
a
beautiful
example
of
a
bootstrap
technique
characterization
with
which
judge
donahue
in
the
ninth
circuit
readily
agreed.”
he
goes
on
to
say,
“first,
the
government
minimizes
the
violation
of
the
various
statutory
provisions,
characterizing
them
as
technical
defects
and
then
in
typical
bootstrap
fashion
postulates
that
for
minor
violations,
there
should
be
no
sanctions.
the
defects
in
this
case
however
go
to
the
very
heart
of
title
iii.”
the
senate
report
dealing
with
section
2515
provides
that
this
section
must
be
read
in
light
of
section
2518
(10)
(a).
again,
the
gelbard
opinion
where
mr.
justice
brennan
wrote
for
this
court
is
instructive
in
noting
that
indeed
the
congressional
findings
articulate
clearly
the
intent
to
utilize
the
evidentiary
prohibition
of
2515
to
enforce
the
limitations
imposed
by
title
iii
upon
wiretapping
and
electronic
surveillance.
the
seventh
circuit
in
robert’s
meets
the
government’s
argument
as
to
the
drastic
remedy
of
suppression
by
noting
that
2515
and
2518
(10)
(a)
are
patently
clear
in
expressing
the
congressional
judgment
that
these
intercepted
communications
may
not
be
received
in
evidence.
this
whole
area
i
submit
is
placed
in
perspective
by
this
additional
cogent
statement
by
chief
judge
bazelon
in
the
case
of
in
re
evans
wherein
he
said,
“first,
2515
describes
in
the
most
sweeping
possible
terms
of
prohibition
against
the
use
of
evidence
tainted
by
an
awful
wiretap,
but
the
section
gives
no
indication
of
a
specific
remedy.
viewed
as
a
whole,
however,
omnibus
crime
control
act
does
provide
such
a
remedy.
the
motion
to
suppress
authorized
by
2518
(10)
(a).”
the
no
need
to
deter
argument
rejected
in
robinson
which
is
here
again
advanced
by
the
government
is
disposed
of
in
the
vicky
(ph)
case
in
the
following
fashion.
the
government
claims
that
no
real
deterrent
effect
would
result
from
suppression.
however,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
court
fashioned
exclusionary
rule.
what
we
have
here
is
a
separate
statutory
requirement
which
this
court
has
no
authority
to
ignore.
judge
becker
enunciated
the
potential
problem
in
the
narducci
case
wherein
he
stated,
“the
necessity
for
strict
compliance
with
the
statute
in
a
wiretap
situation
stems
as
much
from
the
precedence
setting
example
of
condoning
laxity
which
could
lead
to
further
laxity
in
years
to
come.”
as
for
the
2518
point,
i
will
defer
to
mr.
hewitt,
he’ll
argue
the
chavez
case.
however,
i
would
note
that
in
this
area,
the
congress
intended
if
indeed
it
be
a
matter
of
form,
that
form
be
treated
as
importantly
as
substance.
the
implementation
of
this
awesome
authority,
i
submit,
was
to
be
treated
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
mandate.
in
our
brief,
reference
is
made
to
a
course
of
conduct
here
engaged
in
by
the
department
of
justice
as
amounting
to
scheme
of
governmental
trickery.
on
reflection,
i
submit
and
confess
that
this
was
too
harsh
a
term
to
the
extent
that
was
too
harsh
a
judgment,
i
apologize.
but
if
use
of
so
dramatic
a
term
is
inappropriate,
i
would
submit
that
what
we
have
here
is
of
course
of
governmental
inattention,
indeed,
what
i
submit
does
amount
to
governmental
willfulness
and
governmental
sloppiness
of
a
quality
mounting
up
to
gross
mishandling
in
a
particularly
sensitive
area,
the
appropriate
remedy
for
which
must
necessarily
be
suppression
of
all
evidence
obtained
from
the
wiretaps
in
this
and
cases
similarly
situated.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
giordano
case
the
court
has
confronted
with
compounded
violations
of
title
iii,
specifically
sections
2516
(1)
and
2518
(1)
(a)
and
(4)
(d).
as
for
the
section
2516
point,
the
fact
is
that
on
october
16,
1970,
francis
s.
brocato,
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
for
the
district
of
maryland
submitted
to
chief
judge
northrop
of
the
united
state
district
court
for
maryland,
an
application
for
an
order
authorizing
the
interception
of
wire
communications
on
the
telephone
of
my
client,
dominic
nicholas
giordano.
attached
to
the
application
as
exhibits
were
a
“will
wilson
letter”
to
mr.
brocato
and
the
affidavits
of
two
agents
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs.
the
will
wilson
letter
evidences
the
fact
that
mr.
brocato
had
requested
authorization
to
apply
for
the
wiretap
order,
this
request
having
been
made
to
then
attorney
general
john
n.
mitchell.
although
the
request
had
been
directed
to
the
attorney
general,
the
record
submitted
in
this
case
shows
that
it
never
was
reviewed
by
the
attorney
general
himself,
but
that
his
initials
had
been
placed
on
the
authorization
memorandum
by
mr.
sol
lindenbaum,
his
executive
assistant.
this
authorization
memorandum
had
then
been
dispatched
to
assistant
attorney
general
will
wilson
or
the
office
of
assistant
attorney
general
will
wilson
purportedly
designating
mr.
wilson
to
authorize
the
application
to
be
presented
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
the
record
in
this
case
and
in
the
case
of
murder
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
held
before
judge
merchants
(ph)
in
the
southern
district
of
florida,
evidences
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
had
never
specially
designated
any
of
his
assistant
attorneys
general
to
issue
wiretap
authorizations.
it
is
also
uncontested
that
the
will
wilson
letters
indeed
were
never
signed
by
mr.
wilson,
not
in
this
case
nor
indeed
in
any
of
the
host
of
cases
which
have
arisen
in
this
series
of
litigation.
there
was
subsequent
to
the
application
for
a
wiretap
order,
application
for
an
extension
order
dated
november
6,
1970,
some
21
days
after
the
original
application.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
indicated
perhaps
some
seven
days
after
the
original
application,
the
attorney
general
had
become
familiar
with
the
operative
facts.
the
affidavit
of
mr.
lindenbaum
indicates
that
some
21
days
later,
the
attorney
general
authorized
the
application
for
an
extension.
included
within
that
application
for
extension
was
another
will
wilson
letter
and
an
additional
affidavit
from
agent
abraham
azaon
(ph)
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs.
on
review
of
the
azaon
affidavit,
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
operative
facts
setting
forth
probable
cause
are
those
investigative
details
and
intelligence
which
developed
pursuant
to
the
original
wiretap.
the
government
i
believe
in
its
brief
indicates
that
the
azaon
application
reasserts
the
facts
that
was
set
forth
in
the
original
application,
indeed,
they
do
not.
it
merely
states
i
reassert
without
specifying
what
those
facts
were,
the
fact
set
forth
in
the
original
application,
indeed,
it
is
an
incorporation
by
reference
type
approach.
i
would
ask
this
honorable
court
to
look
critically
at
the
particular
facts
in
the
case
at
hand
as
indeed
i
suspect
they
are
at
perhaps
some
variance
from
the
facts
which
the
government
indicates
in
its
brief
developed
at
some
subsequent
point
in
time
with
regard
to
checking
with
the
attorney
general
and
apprising
him
of
the
facts
after
the
fact.
as
for
the
section
2518
point,
it
must
be
noted
that
not
only
did
mr.
wilson
not
sign
the
letter,
he
indeed
never
saw
any
of
the
papers
in
this
case
nor
indeed
did
the
attorney
general
prior
to
the
application
for
the
extension
order.
mr.
wilson
testified
as
i
indicated
before
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
in
the
marder
case,
at
which
time
he
stated
he
did
not
know
that
the
will
wilson
letter
was
being
submitted
to
united
state
district
courts
around
the
country.
in
fact,
he
testified
the
“did
not
know
exactly
what
was
made
of
them.”
he
did
not
know
that
mr.
lindenbaum
was
signing
the
attorney
generals
initials
to
authorization
memos.
he
did
not
know
that
anyone
other
than
the
attorney
general,
in
fact,
was
authorizing
wiretaps.
i
would
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
this
suggests
a
rather
amazing
lack
of
communication
within
the
department
of
justice.
this
incredibly
loose
procedure
led
the
late
judge
sobeloff
to
conclude
in
his
opinion
below
and
i
quote
“if
judge
northrop
had
been
aware
of
the
real
status
of
the
application,
that
neither
mitchell
nor
wilson
even
knew
of
it
and
that
the
application
had
been
approved
and
initialed
jnm
by
lindenbaum,
we
are
certain
that
he
would
have
refused
to
permit
the
wiretap.”
the
sequence
of
events
here
involve
i
submit
constitutes
the
“elaborate
paper
charade”
which
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
condemned
in
the
king
case.
it
is
significant
that
where
the
violations
herein
question
have
been
shown
to
exist
in
combination,
the
vast
majority
of
federal
courts
have
found
a
violation
of
2516
and
have
decreed
suppression
as
the
remedy.
in
addition
to
the
giordano
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
there
is
the
opinion
of
course
of
the
robinson
court
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
per
curiam
opinion
in
the
robert’s
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
king
case
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
mantello
case.
in
addition,
to
the
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
the
pisacano
case
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
second
circuit
which
was
later
followed
although
i
must
say
i
don’t
feel
embraced
by
the
opinion
in
the
becker
case,
judge
friendly
wrote
--

mr.

the
second
circuit,
is
the
only
circuit
that
i
am
aware
of
mr.
justice
brennan
to
the
contrary.
mr.

it
went
back
to
the
southern
district
of
florida.
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
conducted
in
the
marder
case
and
i
gather
the
case
is
now
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit
again.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
the
original
opinion
resulted
in
a
petition
for
rehearing.

in
reliance
on
2515
and
2518
(10)
(a).
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
is
precisely
correct.
in
addition
to
the
circuits
which
have
so
held,
a
number
of
district
courts
in
other
circuits,
specifically
two
courts
i
believe
in
the
third
circuit
and
courts
in
the
sixth
circuit
have
ruled
in
like
manner.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
yes
your
honor,
we
feel
that
the
remedy
here
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
we
feel
that
title
iii
is
self
executing
as
to
remedy.
the
robert’s
courts
speaks
of
the
persuasive
reason
--
reasoning
of
judge
sobeloff
in
giordano.
indeed
giordano
seems
to
be
the
case
most
frequently
looked
to
for
guidance,
most
frequently
cited
and
whose
language
is
most
frequently
adopted
by
other
courts.
the
court’s
have
with
overwhelming
consistency
really
viewed
the
2516
defect
as
a
substantial
violation.
with
this
background
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
section
2516
with
the
rationale
for
that
section
and
speak
to
the
government’s
contentions
concerning
the
section.
judge
sobeloff
in
his
opinion
below
effectively
lays
to
rest
the
alter
ego
theory
which
has
with
recurring
predictability
been
advanced
by
the
government.
judge
sobeloff
stating
in
pertinent
part,
“the
alter
ego
theory
is
open
ended.
it
need
not
stop
with
lindenbaum
but
could
be
extended
with
an
equal
claim
of
validity
to
anyone
within
or
without
the
department
of
justice.
in
determining
who
qualifies
as
an
alter
ego,
it
would
permit
side
stepping
the
congressional
mandate,
fixing
the
level
of
those
who
maybe
designated
to
authorize
applications.”
senate
report
1097
is
instructive
wherein
referring
to
section
2516
(1),
it
is
stated
and
i
quote
this
language
which
has
earlier
been
referred
to
by
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
but
which
i
feel
bears
repeating,
“this
provision
centralizes
in
a
publicly
responsible
officials
subject
to
the
political
process,
the
formulation
of
law
enforcement
policy
on
the
use
of
electronic
surveillance
techniques.
centralization
will
avoid
the
possibility
that
divergent
practices
might
develop,
should
abuses
occur,
the
lines
of
responsibility
lead
to
an
identifiable
person.”
the
legislative
history
of
course
speaks
to
identifiable
person
and
not
an
identifiable
office.
in
the
first
robinson
case,
the
court
after
noting
this
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
submit
it
does
not
your
honor.
identifiable
persons
speaks
of
that
individual
either
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
he
is
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
yes,
he
is
mr.
chief
justice,
the
attorney
general.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
i
submit
to
what
the
senate
reflects
in
this
legislative
history
is
that
they
are
speaking
though
of
the
person
either
in
the
position
of
attorney
general
or
one
of
his
assistant
attorneys
general
who
has
gone
through
the
process
of
senatorial
confirmation.
the
senate
obliged
to
exercise
this
degree
of
supervision
shall
we
say
or
restraint
over
exercise
of
the
awesome
power
of
wire
surveillance.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
h.
russel

i
cannot
speak
to
acting
assistants,
i’m
not
sure
that
they

they
have
gone
through
the
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
they
have
not
gone
through
the
confirmation
process
i
would
say
no
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
in
the
legislative
history,
actually
senate
report
1097,
where
it
speaks
to
official
subject
to
the
political
process
and
i
submit
that
means
the
confirmation
process,
that
is
the
rationale
really
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
robinson
case
wherein
that
court
noted
by
expressing
its
intention
that
only
a
publicly
responsible
official
subject
to
the
political
process
could
initiate
a
wiretap
application.
congress
wanted
to
make
certain
that
every
such
matter
would
have
the
personal
attention
of
an
individual
appointed
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate.
mr.
h.
russel

i
would
your
honor
unless
he

as
i

mr.

has
been

i
believed
he
had

as

mr.
h.
russel
smouse
he
has
been
tested
by
the
political
process.[laughter]
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
they
are
involved
in
the
political
process
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
but
they
have
not
been
senatorially
confirmed
and
i
feel
that
senate
meant
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
do
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
confirmation
is
what
the
senate
had
in
mind.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
they
do
not
say
it.
i
fell
that
is
inherent
in
the
language
of
the
legislative
history
and
i
feel
that
the
interpretation
placed
on
that
history
by
a
number
of
lower
courts
which
have
looked
to
the
problem
is
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
believe
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
a
stamp
of
approval
has
not
been
placed
on
them
by
the
senate
in
an
area
where
the
senate
wanted
great
care
exercise
in
the
authorization
of
wiretap
surveillance.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
would
easily
be
met
mr.
chief
justice
had
his
predecessor
designated
an
assistant
attorney
general
to
exercise
authorization
in
this
area
and
the
congress
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice,
i
feel
that
if
the
attorney
general
had
exercised
the
foresight
here
to
designate
the
man
chosen
to
head
the
criminal
division
to
authorize
wiretap
applications
obviously,
there
would
not
be
this
host
of
cases
before
the
courts.
provision
for
delegation
was
made
so
that
the
government
could
operate
in
an
effective
fashion
in
the
area
of
criminal
investigation
and
in
utilization
of
wire
surveillance.
it
merely
required
some
delegation
within
that
authorized
for
the
statute
and
easily
enough,
the
attorney
general
could
have
designated
one
his
assistants
and
the
acting
attorney
general
who
might
succeed
him
would
have
the
benefit
then
of
a
person
properly
designated.
this
honorable
court
in
gelbard
through
mr.
justice
brennan
writing
for
the
majority
made
the
following
significant
comment
concerning
title
iii
in
noting
that
act
sets
forth
and
i
quote,
“an
approval
that
may
not
be
given
except
upon
compliance
with
astringent
condition,”
citing
18
u.s.c.
2516
and
2518
(1)
through
(8)
obviously
and
admittedly
the
gelbard
case
did
not
involve
any
of
the
issues
here
before
the
court
but
i
feel
that
language
is
helpful
and
instructive.
the
courts
i
submit
in
the
better
reason
cases
speak
in
terms
of
2516
being
enacted
as
a
necessary
safeguard
as
expressed
in
the
following
language
in
king.
the
act
in
its
legislative
history
may
clear
the
purpose
of
the
authorization
requirement
2516
(1),
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
grave
threat
to
the
privacy
of
every
american
that
is
posed
by
modern
techniques
of
electronic
surveillance.
in
order
to
insure
circumspection
in
their
use,
congress
erected
the
elaborate
procedural
safeguards,
then
citing
2516.
and
as
earlier
been
noted,
the
language
of
the
statute
authorizing
but
limiting
the
delegation
evolved
from
the
testimony
of
then
assistant
attorney
general
miller,
head
of
the
criminal
division.
the
responsibility
theory
which
the
government
has
advanced
in
his
brief
in
this
case
in
which
forums,
the
underlying
rationale
of
pisacano,
we
submit
ignores
the
complete
legislative
history
and
ignores
the
specifically
limiting
language
of
section
2516
and
as
i
noted
before,
judge
mansfield
in
the
second
circuit
in
writing
in
becker
expressed
no
great
enthusiasm
for
the
pisacano
holding
where
he
stated,
“we
feel
bound
to
follow
pisacano
especially
since
it
is
so
recent
and
the
facts
before
the
court
are
indistinguishable.
our
adherents
to
the
law,
the
circuit
has
thus
established
is
not
to
be
considered
as
an
approval
of
the
procedure
followed
by
the
attorney
general
and
his
staff.”
with
regard
to
the
general
delegation
of
authority,
section
28
u.s.c.
section
510
would
submit
that
as
stated
in
our
brief,
normal
rules
of
statutory
construction
reject
the
applicability
of
that
general
delegation
of
authority.
section
2516
is
narrow,
specific
and
limited
in
terms.
moreover,
28
u.s.c.
section
510
was
in
existence
prior
to
the
enactment
of
title
iii.
the
fifth
circuit
in
robinson,
i
submit
properly
concluded
that
2516
(1)
was
intended
to
act
as
a
limit
upon
section
510.
concerning
the
remedy,
the
statute
itself
in
sections
2515
and
2518
(10)
(a)
(1)
and
(2)
mandates
the
remedy
and
it
should
be
noted
that
the
violation
here
is
of
considerable
dimension.
this
is
not
an
isolated
case,
not
an
incidental
slip
up.
from
the
host
of
cases
where
the
violations
herein
question
have
been
framed,
it
clearly
appears
that
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
disregard
to
the
statutory
safeguards
of
title
iii
in
the
area
of
authorization
and
identification
were
continuing
and
constantly
recurring
within
the
department
of
justice.
the
government
seems
to
espouse
this
applicable
--
the
standard
suggested
by
the
american
law
institute.
it's
footnoted
on
page
41
of
the
government’s
brief
where
it
is
proposed
that
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
be
determined
by
the
substantiality
of
the
infringement
involved.
while
as
i
noted
before,
we
submit
that
the
statute
itself
mandates
the
remedy
and
that
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
the
judicially
framed
exclusionary
rule
even
looking
at
the
test
espoused
by
the
government,
it
must
be
recognized
that
the
course
of
conduct
engaged
in
by
the
department
of
justice
forded
the
clear
requirements
of
title
iii
and
the
purpose
of
the
sections
in
question
and
the
violation
of
them
as
i
noted
before
was
recurring
and
if
quantum
of
impropriety
is
to
be
the
applicable
standard
in
this
case
then
i
submit
that
suppression
must
necessary
follow.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
would
rely
on
both
your
honor.
in
fact
judge
sobeloff
i
believe
spoke
in
terms
of
(2)
and
--
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
veckerelli
(ph)
case
turned
it,
yes
your
honor
that
is
correct,
actually
turned
on
the
2518
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
2516
violation.
we
submit
that,
actually,
what
the
government
here
proposes
is
that
this
honorable
court
ignored
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
the
government
moreover
seems
to
fail
to
acknowledge
the
enormity
of
the
violation
involved
and
turns
its
argument
or
its
approach
on
a
proposition
that
the
violations
in
question
are
not
central
to
fourth
amendment
values
and
so
sanction
should
be
something
less
and
suppression.
i
submit
that
neither
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
or
legislative
history
nor
judicial
interpretation
would
support
this
contention.
this
honorable
court
in
burger
spoke
in
terms
of
protective
procedures
in
the
area
of
eavesdropping
which
of
course
would
embrace
wire
surveillance,
so
as
to
ensure
the
protection
of
inherent
fourth
amendment
rights.
i
would
submit
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
the
right
of
conversational
privacy.
as
noted
in
scot,
title
iii
represents
the
effort
of
congress
to
meet
the
concerns
expressed
by
this
honorable
court
in
burger
and
katz
and
to
structure
a
limited
system
of
wire
surveillance
and
electronic
eavesdropping
within
the
framework
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
guidelines
of
burger
and
katz.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
they
have
changed
and
apparently
corrected
their
procedures.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
no
such
language
in
burger
and
katz.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
do
not.
mr.
h.
russel
smouse
i
do
not.
burger
as
the
court
well
knows
spoke
in
terms
of
protective
procedures.
your
honor,
i
believe
in
katz
spoke
in
terms
of
appropriate
safeguards.
congress
cognizant
of
this
express
concerned
by
this
court
for
the
need
to
embrace
protective
procedures,
framed
title
iii
in
an
effort
to
meet
those
concerns
and
to
meet
congressional
concern
over
a
limited
approach
in
this
area.
again,
if
i
may
borrow
from
the
language
of
judge
sobeloff,
rejecting
the
government
contention
that
suppression
would
be
inappropriate,
he
stated
and
i
quote,
“this
is
a
beautiful
example
of
a
bootstrap
technique
characterization
with
which
judge
donahue
in
the
ninth
circuit
readily
agreed.”
he
goes
on
to
say,
“first,
the
government
minimizes
the
violation
of
the
various
statutory
provisions,
characterizing
them
as
technical
defects
and
then
in
typical
bootstrap
fashion
postulates
that
for
minor
violations,
there
should
be
no
sanctions.
the
defects
in
this
case
however
go
to
the
very
heart
of
title
iii.”
the
senate
report
dealing
with
section
2515
provides
that
this
section
must
be
read
in
light
of
section
2518
(10)
(a).
again,
the
gelbard
opinion
where
mr.
justice
brennan
wrote
for
this
court
is
instructive
in
noting
that
indeed
the
congressional
findings
articulate
clearly
the
intent
to
utilize
the
evidentiary
prohibition
of
2515
to
enforce
the
limitations
imposed
by
title
iii
upon
wiretapping
and
electronic
surveillance.
the
seventh
circuit
in
robert’s
meets
the
government’s
argument
as
to
the
drastic
remedy
of
suppression
by
noting
that
2515
and
2518
(10)
(a)
are
patently
clear
in
expressing
the
congressional
judgment
that
these
intercepted
communications
may
not
be
received
in
evidence.
this
whole
area
i
submit
is
placed
in
perspective
by
this
additional
cogent
statement
by
chief
judge
bazelon
in
the
case
of
in
re
evans
wherein
he
said,
“first,
2515
describes
in
the
most
sweeping
possible
terms
of
prohibition
against
the
use
of
evidence
tainted
by
an
awful
wiretap,
but
the
section
gives
no
indication
of
a
specific
remedy.
viewed
as
a
whole,
however,
omnibus
crime
control
act
does
provide
such
a
remedy.
the
motion
to
suppress
authorized
by
2518
(10)
(a).”
the
no
need
to
deter
argument
rejected
in
robinson
which
is
here
again
advanced
by
the
government
is
disposed
of
in
the
vicky
(ph)
case
in
the
following
fashion.
the
government
claims
that
no
real
deterrent
effect
would
result
from
suppression.
however,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
court
fashioned
exclusionary
rule.
what
we
have
here
is
a
separate
statutory
requirement
which
this
court
has
no
authority
to
ignore.
judge
becker
enunciated
the
potential
problem
in
the
narducci
case
wherein
he
stated,
“the
necessity
for
strict
compliance
with
the
statute
in
a
wiretap
situation
stems
as
much
from
the
precedence
setting
example
of
condoning
laxity
which
could
lead
to
further
laxity
in
years
to
come.”
as
for
the
2518
point,
i
will
defer
to
mr.
hewitt,
he’ll
argue
the
chavez
case.
however,
i
would
note
that
in
this
area,
the
congress
intended
if
indeed
it
be
a
matter
of
form,
that
form
be
treated
as
importantly
as
substance.
the
implementation
of
this
awesome
authority,
i
submit,
was
to
be
treated
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
mandate.
in
our
brief,
reference
is
made
to
a
course
of
conduct
here
engaged
in
by
the
department
of
justice
as
amounting
to
scheme
of
governmental
trickery.
on
reflection,
i
submit
and
confess
that
this
was
too
harsh
a
term
to
the
extent
that
was
too
harsh
a
judgment,
i
apologize.
but
if
use
of
so
dramatic
a
term
is
inappropriate,
i
would
submit
that
what
we
have
here
is
of
course
of
governmental
inattention,
indeed,
what
i
submit
does
amount
to
governmental
willfulness
and
governmental
sloppiness
of
a
quality
mounting
up
to
gross
mishandling
in
a
particularly
sensitive
area,
the
appropriate
remedy
for
which
must
necessarily
be
suppression
of
all
evidence
obtained
from
the
wiretaps
in
this
and
cases
similarly
situated.
thank
you.
