mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
two
cases,
united
states
against
giordano
and
united
against
--
united
states
against
chavez
which
involves
the
suppression
of
wire
interception
evidence
and
the
fruits
of
that
evidence
in
narcotics
cases.
the
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
and
ninth
circuits
respectively.
in
both
cases
the
district
court
suppressed
the
evidence
applying
title
iii
of
the
organized
--
of
the
title
iii
of
the
safe
streets
statute
and
this
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
this
court
granted
the
government
petition
for
certiorari.
these
two
cases
represent
a
great
many
cases.
some
of
them
pending
here
on
petitions
for
certiorari
and
others
awaiting
resolution
in
lower
courts
being
held
up.
the
issue
as
the
government
sees
it
is
entirely
a
statutory
one.
it’s
a
--
the
construction
of
title
iii
of
the
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968
and
the
government's
--
the
propriety,
the
adequacy
of
the
government’s
procedures
in
processing
applications
to
courts
for
orders
permitting
wire
interception.
the
--
in
addition
to
the
adequacy
of
those
procedures,
the
cases
raise
the
question
of
whether
assuming
the
procedures
were
in
some
degree
defective,
suppression
is
the
remedy
called
for.
at
the
outset
i’d
like
to
stress
what
these
cases
are
not
about.
there
are
no
constitutional
violations
in
our
view
in
these
cases,
no
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
those
provisions
of
this
statute
which
were
going
to
comply
with
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
burger
and
cass
were
fully
complied
with.
courts
did
pass
upon
probable
cause
and
all
other
fourth
amendment
elements.
there’s
no
contention
nor
i
think
could
there
be
any,
but
the
evidence
that
has
been
suppressed
is
not
reliable
evidence,
there
is
not
accurate
evidence.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
--
in
these
cases
of
convicting
innocent
persons.
i
think
as
we
look
at
the
case
and
the
facts,
it
will
also
become
perfectly
plain
that
the
government’s
procedures
which
in
one
or
two
respects
certainly
must
be
said
to
be
not
the
best
compliance
with
some
aspects
of
the
statute,
do
not
display
any
malevolent
purpose.
there
was
no
sinister
purpose,
there
was
no
purpose
of
hiding
anything
in
these
procedures
and
i
think
insofar
as
there
was
a
deviation
from
a
procedure,
we
can
just
--
we
can
demonstrate
that
it
was
a
harmless
error
and
an
error
i
might
add
which
is
now
have
been
corrected.
let
me
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it’s
been
corrected
for
some
time
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
70
--
1972,
the
last
correction
took
place
in
november,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
every
one
of
these
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
there
was
a
letter
authorizing
an
application
which
went
out
over
the
signature
of
mr.
will
wilson,
then
head
of
the
criminal
division.
the
letter
looked
as
if
mr.
will
wilson
had
made
the
operative
decision
to
authorize
the
application
to
the
court.
as
a
result,
the
court
orders
identified
mr.
wilson
as
the
person
who
had
authorized
the
application.
in
fact,
those
applications
had
been
authorized
either
by
the
attorney
general
in
most
cases
and
in
some
cases
by
the
executive
assistant,
the
attorney
general
mr.
sullivan
involved.
that
was
a
result
entirely
as
i
hope
to
show
of
the
way
the
internal
memorandum
were
drafted
in
the
department
of
justice
and
was
not
a
deliberate
misidentification
in
any
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
had
accurate
information
as
to
everything
except,
mr.
wilson’s
name.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
has,
i
think
it
has
importance
under
the
statute.
i
don’t
think
it
has
any
importance
that
we
justify
suppression
in
these
cases.
perhaps,
it
would
help
i
can
describe
the
general
procedures
that
were
followed
in
all
of
these
cases
and
the
statutory
provisions
that
are
claimed
to
be
violated
by
that
fact
and
then
come
to
the
particular
facts
of
these
two
cases.
when
it
was
thought
by
an
investigator
or
a
field
attorney
that
a
wire
interception
order
was
required
or
was
appropriate,
he
would
then
gather
together
the
information
and
affidavits
and
the
application
to
show
probable
cause,
the
necessity
for
the
use
of
wire
interception
as
a
technique
and
the
other
aspects
of
the
statute
calls
for.
he
would
forward
that
to
washington.
in
washington,
it
was
reviewed
by
an
attorney
in
the
special
unit
of
the
organized
crime
and
racketeering
section
of
the
criminal
division,
a
special
unit
setup
just
for
this
purpose.
that
was
the
main
review.
it
then
went
with
the
memorandum
from
the
attorney
in
that
unit
to
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
a
criminal
division
whereby
designation
it
was
reviewed
by
one
of
the
two
deputies,
one
of
the
two
deputies,
attorney
general’s
mr.
shapiro
or
mr.
peterson
at
that
time.
should
they
approve
and
i
should
stress
that
at
every
level,
disapproval
meant
it
was
sent
back.
it
did
not
--
if
anybody
disapproved,
it
did
the
applic
--
the
authorization
--
that
request
did
not
go
on
and
a
number
of
them
were
in
fact
sent
back.
should
they
approve
the
application
and
the
memo
were
sent
up
to
the
attorney
general’s
office
where
it
was
reviewed
by
the
executive
assistant
mr.
sol
lindenbaum,
who
was
been
the
executive
assistant
to
the
attorney’s
general
starting
with
attorney
general
mr.
ramsey
clark
and
is
still
the
executive
assistant
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
lindenbaum
would
review
it
and
then
send
it
on
to
the
attorney
general,
mr.
mitchell
with
his
recommendation.
through
1969
when
this
practice
--
when
the
experience
with
the
statute
first
began,
33
such
applications
were
authorized
by
mr.
mitchell
personally.
mr.
lindenbaum
in
1969
did
not
attaches
mr.
mitchell’s
initials
to
any.
they
were
all
--
everyone
was
done
by
mr.
mitchell.
as
1970
began
and
the
flow
of
these
applications
begin
to
increase
and
mr.
mitchell
began
to
do
some
traveling.
as
close
as
we
can
calculate
it,
about
april
1st,
1970
after
there
had
been
some
further
experience
beyond
the
33
applications
in
1969,
mr.
mitchell
authorized
orally
mr.
lindenbaum
to
act
on
his
behalf
when
mr.
mitchell
was
out
--
was
unavailable
and
could
not
be
reached
by
telephone
with
the
statement
that
when
he
returned,
mr.
lindenbaum
was
to
tell
him
what
he’d
done
in
this
respects
and
he
would
then
see
whether
he
approved
as
he
did
in
all
of
these
cases.
now
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
--
if
he
hadn’t
approve,
i
assume
that
the
interception
would
have
terminated.
but
mr.
lindenbaum
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
for
the
month,
mr.
justice
stewart,
correct.
i
want
to
--
i
wish
to
say
however
that
mr.
lindenbaum
was
operating
under
a
policy
established
by
mr.
mitchell
and
that
he
had
worked
on
these
things
with
mr.
mitchell
for
some
time
before
he
began
to
do
this
and
i
think
that
was
no
question
and
he
understood
the
policy
mr.
mitchell
was
applying.
and
i
should
also
stress
although
i’m
afraid
that
something
stressed
repeatedly,
that
although
the
interception
would
have
taken
place,
had
such
a
thing
occurred,
it
would
have
only
taken
place
after
a
court
had
determined
that
every
element
of
probable
cause
and
every
other
required
element
was
present.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
under
your
hypothetical
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
under
your
hypothetical
that
would
be
true.
however,
that
did
not
happen
and
these
procedures
are
no
longer
in
effect
so
it
cannot
happen.
now,
the
--
about
a
150
to
180
of
these
applications
out
of
--
appeared
to
have
been
initialed
by
mr.
lindenbaum
with
mr.
mitchell’s
signature.
now,
that’s
out
of
a
total
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
the
1971
when
these
practice
was
first
questioned
in
court
because
the
department
of
justice
said
no
inkling,
anybody,
they're
being
troublesome
about
this
practice.
when
they
were
first
questioned
in
the
court,
they
changed
it.
but
i
wish
to
say,
about
those
170
or
so
applications
that
were
authored
by
--
authorized
by
mr.
lindenbaum
putting
mr.
mitchell’s
signatures
on
the
memorandum,
that
a
great
many
of
those
were
in
fact
applications
that
had
been
authorized
by
mr.
mitchell
over
the
telephone.
mr.
lindenbaum
had
gotten
to
him
over
the
telephone,
had
read
hem
the
stuff
and
read
him
the
material
and
had
received
mr.
mitchell’s
approval.
and
so
that
mr.
lindenbaum
was
performing
in
those
cases
a
ministerial
act
only
of
doing
what
mr.
mitchell
conformed
we
should
do.
unfortunately,
mr.
lindenbaum
did
not
keep
a
record
of
the
telephone
calls
so
that
we
in
every
case
in
which
mr.
lindenbaum
put
mr.
mitchell
signatures
on
the
memorandum,
we
must
assume
that
that
maybe
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
telephone
authorization.
although
we
know
that
a
great
many
of
them
were
in
fact
authorized
by
telephone.
it’s
at
this
stage
that
the
first
problem
of
--
or
claim
of
violation
of
the
statute
occurs
because
in
title
iii,
18
u.s.c
2516,
it
is
provided
that
the
attorney
general
or
any
assistant
attorney
general
specially
designated
by
the
attorney
general
may
authorize
an
application
to
a
federal
judge.
and
the
claim
is
that
when
mr.
lindenbaum,
the
executive
assistant
applying
the
policy
laid
down
for
him
by
the
attorney
general
authorized
that
that
falls
outside
the
statute.
now,
the
second
issue
arises
because
of
the
form
of
the
memorandum
that
mr.
lindenbaum
or
mr.
mitchell
in
most
cases
actually
initialed.
the
form
of
the
memorandum
was
draft
--
the
memorandum
was
drafted
so
as
to
track
the
statute.
that
memorandum
was
drafted
by
so
far
as
we
can
tell
by
an
attorney
in
the
special
unit
which
first
reviews
these
things
and
send
up
with
the
file
from
mr.
mitchell
to
authorize
it.
and
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
special
delegation
so
that
when
the
memorandum
was
initialed,
it
went
back
down
to
the
criminal
division,
addressed
to
mr.
wilson
saying
pursuant
to
the
powers
conferred
on
me
by
section
2516
of
title
18,
you
are
hereby
specially
designated
to
exercise
those
powers
for
the
purpose
of
authorizing,
the
particular
trial
attorney,
to
make
the
above
described
application.
he’s
delegate
--
he’s
designated
solely
for
the
purpose
of
authorizing
it
so
that
it’s
understood
that
mr.
wilson
is
to
perform
a
ministerial
act.
he’s
not
designated
to
make
any
judgment.
in
fact
the
judgment
of
the
criminal
division
had
already
been
made
when
the
file
was
on
its
way
up
or
it
wouldn’t
have
gone
up.
the
net
result
was,
when
that
memorandum
went
down,
this
ministerial
act
of
affixing
a
--
mr.
wilson’s
signature
to
a
letter
was
performed
by
one
of
his
two
deputies,
both
of
whom
were
authorized
to
do
this
in
a
number
of
matters
to
mr.
henry
peterson
and
mr.
harold
shapiro.
the
letter
went
out,
as
we
have
noted,
looking
as
if
mr.
wilson
had
made
the
operative
decision
when
in
fact
the
attorney
general
had
made
the
operative
decision
or
in
some
cases,
the
attorney
general’s
executive
assistant.
and
the
attorney
in
the
field
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
about
this
memorandum
in
its
form
and
why
does
it
occur,
so
he
would
assume,
usually
that
mr.
will
wilson
had
made
the
operative
decision.
and
he
would
so
tell
the
court
and
it
is
claimed
there
and
the
court
would
include
that
fact
in
its
order
and
the
claim
therefore
is
that
section
2518
of
title
18
which
provides
that
each
application
shall
include
the
following
information;
(a)
the
identity
of
the
author
authorizing
the
application
and
in
4
(d);
the
identity
of
the
person
authorizing
the
application
must
be
in
the
judge’s
order,
the
wire
intercept
order.
in
all
of
these
cases
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
--
in
every
one
of
these
wire
intercept
order,
some
500
of
them,
mr.
wilson’s
name
appears,
criminal
division,
because
of
this
memorandum
and
forums
that
were
used
in
the
department.
there
is
no
--
all
of
the
cases
involved
what
we
call
the
will
wilson
issue
because
of
that
formal
letter
going
out.
only
some
of
the
cases
involved
the
question
of
the
delegation
by
mr.
mitchell
to
mr.
lindenbaum
of
the
authority.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
nobody
caught
it.
in
fact
mr.
justice
white
when
we
caught
--
when
the
department
caught
the
delegation
problem
because
litigation
arose
of
it,
the
delegation
from
mr.
mitchell
to
mr.
lindenbaum,
they
corrected
that.
they
didn’t
look
at
the
other
form
and
that
continued
until
litigation
began
over
that
form.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
right.
and
the
--
these
forms
--
this
was
a
new
statute,
when
mr.
mitchell
started
to
apply
it
working
with
the
statute,
hadn’t
been
used
before
and
that
there
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
--
some
of
this
relevant
positions
had
been
propositions,
had
been,
yes,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
did
identify
that
man,
that
was
the
trial
attorney,
or
the
investigator.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
they
did
not
invest
--
they
did
not
correctly
identify
the
officer
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
authorizing
the
application.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
will
wilson
certainly
never
signed
the
letter
and
the
best
that
can
be
said
about
the
authorization
procedure
is
that
if
delegation
is
permissible
in
this
area,
point
that
i
would
come
to,
he
had
delegated
on
the
way
up
the
power
to
approve
the
application
to
his
deputies,
two
deputies,
mr.
peterson
and
mr.
shapiro
and
they
did
approve
them
on
the
way
up.
when
the
memo
came
back
down,
mr.
wilson
made
no
operative
decision
and
neither
did
his
deputies
at
that
stage.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don’t
-
-
i
think
whether
the
--
used
the
stamp
or
facsimile,
i
don’t
know,
but
they
did
put
on
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
yes.
in
fact
that
there
are
many
as
i
intend
to
state,
there
are
many
cases
in
which
delegations
of
this
sort
or
authorizations
to
[inaudible].
in
the
case
of
mr.
wilson,
when
the
memorandum
came
back
down,
i
believe
it’s
quite
clearly
a
ministerial
act
at
that
stage
and
the
only
problem,
there’s
no
question
about
the
authority
to
put
on
the
name,
the
only
problem
is
that
when
it
--
when
the
letter
goes
out
that
way,
the
attorney
in
the
field
tells
the
court
that
mr.
wilson
made
the
operative
decision
when
in
fact
mr.
mitchell
made
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
only
meant
with
that
mr.
justice
douglas
was
that
the
fact
that
somebody
else
signed
mr.
wilson’s
signature,
i
think
was
ministerial.
the
fact
that
the
signature
should
not
have
been
there
as
the
person
authorizing
is
not
ministerial,
that’s
more
substantive.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
don’t
think
there
was
any
delegation
of
a
signing
of
subpoenas.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
had
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
had
the
letter
said,
this
letter
was
only
notifying
the
trial
attorney,
had
the
letter
said,
the
attorney
general
has
authorized
this
as
was
the
case
and
had
mr.
peterson
signed
mr.
wilson’s
name
to
a
statement
that
the
attorney
general
authorized
it,
i
don’t
think
there
would
have
been
any
problem,
that
would
have
been
a
ministerial
act.
the
problem
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
now,
the
problem
is,
the
identification
of
the
authorizing
officer,
not
the
affixing
of
the
signature.
not
the
question
of
which
person
affixed
the
signature.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
said
mr.
justice
white
that
you
are
specially
designated
to
act
in
this
matter
for
the
purpose
of
authorizing
the
application.
pursuant
to
the
powers
conferred
on
me
by
section
2516,
you
are
hereby
specially
designated
to
exercise
those
powers
for
the
purpose
of
authorizing
the
trial
attorney
to
make
the
above
described
application.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
were
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
unless
inquiry
was
made
mr.
justice
marshall
as
it
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
they
would
not.
i
think
however
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
fact
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
in
some
cases
the
executive
assistant
was
doing
it,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
the
--
in
no
case
was
the
judge
told
that
the
attorney
general
did
it.
he
was
always
told
that
mr.
wilson
did
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
even
in
the
case
when
the
attorney
general
was
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
--
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
that
some
of
these
cases,
but
i
might
say
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that’s
not
an
uncommon
situation
in
which
the
attorney
general
delegates
certain
functions
that
are
specified
by
statute
as
being
attorney
general’s
functions.
and
often,
nobody
knows
that
in
fact
the
operative
decision
was
made
by
someone
other
than
the
attorney
general.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
intend
to
discuss
at
some
length
of
fact.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
won’t
answer
it
now,
to
--
i
didn’t
mean
to
put
a
--
i
didn’t
mean
to
put
it
off.
i
just
meant
to
indicate
my
answer
which
is
that
i
think
nobody’s
right
of
privacy
was
interfered
with
in
these
cases
in
any
way.
these
were
all
cases
in
which
every
fourth
amendment
right
was
observed
and
in
which
in
fact
mr.
lindenbaum
applied
mr.
mitchell’s
policy
and
nothing
would
have
changed
had
mr.
mitchell
been
there.
same
interceptions
would
have
occurred.
the
same
findings
of
probable
cause
would
have
been
made.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
issue
comes
down
to
that,
certainly
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
it’s
neither
a
statutory
violation
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
delegation
from
mr.
mitchell
to
mr.
lindenbaum
nor
do
i
think
there
is
any
case
in
the
statute
or
elsewhere
for
suppression
of
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
indeed
--
i
will
come
to
that
and
indeed
in
terms
of
the
delegation
by
mr.
mitchell
to
mr.
lindenbaum,
i
would
contend
that
the
statutory
purposes
are
carried
out
precisely.
there
is
a
unitary
policy.
it
was
established
by
mr.
mitchell
and
mr.
lindenbaum
understood
it
and
carried
it
out
very
well
and
in
fact
the
attorney
general
was
responsible
and
there
has
been
no
question
about
fixing
the
responsibility
to
him.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
--
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
the
2518
(1)
and
(4)
(d)
question.
i
was
addressing
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--
2516
question
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
let
me
come
to
the
--
i
suppose
since
these
cases
are
so
general
in
their
impact,
i
need
not
perhaps
detail
particular
facts
of
this
case
and
how
it
happened
in
the
giordano
case.
mr.
lindenbaum
did
authorize
the
first
application.
when
the
time
came
seven
days
later,
i
believe
it
was
for
the
extension
order,
mr.
mitchell
was
back
in
the
office,
saw
what
had
been
done
and
signed
and
authorized
the
application
for
an
extension.
one
could
see
i
think
ratification
in
that,
but
the
issue
is
far
more
general
than
simply
this
one
case.
although
i
heard
that
when
one
case
but
not
others,
but
let
me
--
the
issue
is
quite
general.
the
issue
of
mr.
mitchell’s
delegation
to
mr.
lindenbaum,
the
2516
(1)
case
affects
60
cases
with
626
defendants.
the
issue
of
mr.
wilson
being
identified
as
the
authorizing
officer
which
is
the
2518
issue
affects
159
cases
with
1433
defendants.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
they
overlap
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
was
about
to
say
all
of
the
mitchell,
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
all
of
the
mitchell-lindenbaum
cases
are
also,
wilson,
a
few
cases
so
that
the
outside
figure
is
1433
defendants
in
these
organized
crime
cases.
there
are
525
applications
for
orders
which
are
at
stake.
in
fact
2
years
work
of
organized
crime
section
is
at
stake
in
these
cases.
i’ve
said
that
the
procedures
here
are
no
longer
in
use.
i
should
say
that
up
until
--
when
this
was
recognized
as
an
issue,
there
would
be
in
litigation,
they
moved
immediately
to
a
case
where
the
attorney
general
made
the
authorization.
the
paper
shows
he
made
the
authorization
and
the
court
has
told
that.
recently,
special
delegation
--
special
designation
has
been
made
to
mr.
henry
peterson,
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
criminal
division
and
he
is
now
making
the
authorizations.
we
argue
this
case
a
little
bit
in
reverse
of
what
would
seem
to
be
usual
order.
that
is
we
usually
argue,
we
didn’t
violate
a
statute,
but
if
we
argue
suppression.
we
argued
suppression
first
in
this
case
not
because
of
any
particular
doubt
about
the
or
feeling
of
weakness
about
the
statutory
argument
because
as
we
looked
at
it
we
felt
the
weight
of
this
case
is
not
our
desire
to
sustain
these
procedures
for
the
future.
they
are
of
no
value.
they
were
accidental
procedures
that
came
about
by
the
way
the
memorandum
were
drafted.
the
weight
of
this
case
is
the
preservation
of
all
of
these
prosecutions
against
defendants
as
to
which
they
government
feels
it
has
a
very
good
case
and
that
is
why
we
argued
the
suppression
point
first
to
indicate
what
the
government
perceives
as
the
importance
of
these
cases.
i
confess
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
any
case
for
the
suppression
of
vital
evidence
and
accurate
evidence
in
this
class
of
cases.
i
think
i
have
sufficiently
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
think
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
suppression
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
operative
provision.
no
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
the
disclosure
provision
goes
back
to
in
violation
of
the
subsection
and
so
forth
and
i
think
you
finally
have
to
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
you
have
to
go
to
2518
(10)
to
see
what
will
sustain
a
motion
to
suppress.
and
any
aggrieved
person
may
move
to
suppress
on
the
grounds
that;
(1)
the
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted,
the
court
below
said
that
that
applied
here.
(2)
the
order
of
authorization
or
approval
under
which
it
was
intercepted
is
insufficient
on
its
face
and
the
court
in
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
that
applied
here.
now,
i
don’t
think
those
provisions
can
be
read.
the
first
provision
i
think
can
--
the
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted
most
certainly
cannot
be
read
to
say
that
if
any
provision
of
this
title
was
deviated
from
in
any
way
a
suppression
is
called
for
because
it’s
an
unlawful
interception.
if
you
read
it
that
way,
there
would
certainly
be
no
reason
to
have
two
or
three
that
the
order
is
insufficient
on
its
face
or
that
the
interception
is
not
made
in
conformity
with
the
order
because
those
are
all
violations
of
the
statute
too.
and
further
more,
it
would
be
very
easy
to
draft
a
statute,
to
say
anytime
you
deviate,
the
evidence
is
suppressed.
that
is
not
what
was
done.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
on
page
39
of
our
brief,
we
quote
the
senate
report.
in
page
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
this
is
in
giordano,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
39.
we
quote
the
senate
report,
it
is
quoted
also
on
page
29
of
respondent
giordano’s
brief
but
i
think
the
passage
quoted
in
that
brief
cuts
off
both
the
–
trivial
too
soon.
the
provision,
section
2515
must
be
read,
the
senate
reports
says,
“in
light
of
section
2518
(10)
(a),”
which
is
the
point
we
have
just
been
making.
“it
largely
reflects
existing
law.”
then
further
down
it
says,
“there
is
no
intention
to
change
the
attenuation
rule
nor
generally
to
press
the
scope
of
the
suppression
rule
beyond
present
search
and
seizure
law.”
i
think
that
reading
of
legislative
history
supports
the
statutory
analysis
i
have
just
suggested
that
if
you
look
at
2518
(10)
(a),
one
obviously
means
the
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted.
i
think
that
means
under
present
search
and
seizure
law,
it
protects
fourth
amendment
values.
it
extends
fourth
amendment
values
in
one
respect
because
it
extends
them
to
grand
jury
proceedings
and
so
forth
where
the
fourth
amendment
might
not
otherwise
apply.
now,
i
don’t
think
the
misidentification
of
will
wilson
as
the
person
who
made
the
operative
decision
nor
the
delegation
in
some
cases
to
sol
lindenbaum
can
be
made
into
a
fourth
amendment
value
and
therefore
i
don’t
think
the
first
point
here
can
conceivably
be
used
to
suppress
the
evidence
of
these
cases.
if
you
go
on
to
the
second
point,
it
says
the
order
of
authorization
or
approval
under
which
it
was
intercepted
is
insufficient
on
its
face.
the
court
of
appeals
said
a
rather
peculiar
thing
i
think.
it
said
that
once
you
realize
that
will
wilson
didn’t
make
the
authorization
which
you
find
out
by
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing,
then
you’re
entitled
to
take
his
name
out
of
the
order,
that
leaves
the
blank
in
the
order
and
at
that
point
it
becomes
insufficient
on
its
face.
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
meaning
in
law
of
insufficiency
on
the
face
of
the
order.
that
order
was
not
insufficient
on
its
face.
it
recited
a
man
who
could
have
been
and
was
specially
designated
and
the
order
was
valid
on
its
face.
i
don’t
know
how
one
can
find
the
facial
invalidity
by
holding
a
hearing
to
find
out
if
the
underlying
facts
are
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
right
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
one
has
to
look
at
it
--
i
think
what
this
too
is,
is
obviously
a
back
stop
to
one.
the
--
(1)
says
of
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted.
(2)
says
insufficient
on
its
face.
that
means
that
the
man
who
receives
the
order
is
to
go
out
and
conduct
the
wire
interception.
if
he
looks
at
the
order
and
he
sees
that
it’s
wrong
on
its
face,
he’s
got
no
business
going
forward,
he
had
to
go
back
and
find
out
why
it’s
wrong.
and
that
of
course,
(3)
is
the
--
he
must
follow
the
order.
so
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no.
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
no
court
has
said
the
three
is
involved
here.
i
can’t
understand
the
facial
invalidity
argument.
respondent's
brief
in
the
giordano
case
cites
some
cases
which
do
not
seem
to
me
as
i
read
and
to
discuss
the
on
its
face
language,
but
in
fact
are
cases
that
say
that
you
may
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
find
out
that
a
witness
who
swore
to
probable
cause,
factual
and
probable
cause
was
not
the
right
witness
or
did
not
have
the
facts
and
so
forth,
the
cases
i
think
which
are
totally
in
apposite
to
the
construction
of
this
language
in
the
statute
about
invalidity
on
the
face
of
it.
i
think
that
when
one
gets
away
--
oh!
i
should
add
i
think
that
this
reading
not
only
comports
with
standard
statutory
analysis
and
what
the
indication
of
legislative
intent
that
we
have,
it
also
makes
common
sense
because
of
the
criminal
penalties
for
wrongful
disclosure
and
because
of
the
civil
liability
or
wrongful
disclosure.
it
seems
to
me
that
we’re
talking
about
fourth
amendment
values
privacy
in
those
areas
and
that’s
what
the
suppression
provisions
are
talking
about
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
but
--
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
i
would
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
in
cases
of
willful
misleading
of
a
court,
this
court
might
care
to
use
its
supervisory
powers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
that’s
the
core
of
the
point.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
would
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
that
in
a
case
where
the
investigator
you
mentioned
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
did
an
intention
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
it
was
in
good
faith
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
i
would
--
i
think
i
have
to
say
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
suppression
provisions
do
not
apply
to
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
congress
could
apply
them
at
any
time.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
terms
of
the
statute,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
terms
of
the
statute
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
probably
correct.
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
possibility
that
a
willful
violation
of
the
statute
might
be
read
either
under
one
as
a
reason
for
suppression
or
that
the
court
might
use
its
supervisory
powers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
i
would
like.
if
i
may
to
reserve
the
possibility
that
willful
violation
of
the
statute,
one
that
was
done
with
the
bad
motive
to
achieve
a
result
that
could
or
what
would
be
achieved.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
to
achieve
a
result
that
couldn't
otherwise
be
achieved.
i
should
point
out
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
that
would
certainly
mr.
chief
justice
be
a
violation
of
one.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
a
case
in
which
the
probable
cause
was
absent.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
certainly
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
certainly
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there
are
wide
varieties
of
situation
in
which
this
would
apply.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
for
example,
i
would
think
failure
to
minimize
the
number
of
interceptions,
failure
to
terminate
when
you
got
the
evidence
that
you’re
suppose
to
get.
i
think
those
are
all
cases
which
would
come
under
number
one.
there
are
a
great
many
of
them.
i
don’t
think
the
situation
we
have
here
today
is,
unless
one
reads
number
one
to
say
that
any
deviation
from
any
provision
of
the
statute
requires
suppression
and
i
don’t
think
one
can
read
it
that
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
they
lie
primarily
with
congress.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
i
meant
by
that
was
that
if
the
congress
wishes
to
add
a
sanction
that’s
where
the
sanction
should
come
from.
should
the
government,
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
should
the
government
having
once
realized
that
its
procedure,
well
i’m
unassuming
now
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
procedures
are
deficient,
should
the
government
once
realized
that
those
procedures
are
deficient
and
continue
with
the
process
then
i
think
i
would
have
no
particular
difficulty
in
saying
that
a
court
faced
with
that
kind
of
government
intransitives
ought
to
apply
as
a
supervisory
matter,
suppression.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
stewart
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
as
a
willful
disclosure
of
a
kind
that
the
statute
forbids
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
isn’t.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
i
doubt
mr.
justice
douglas
that
i
would
think
that
the
delegation
from
this
--
i’m
sure
i
would
think
that
the
delegation
from
mr.
mitchell
and
mr.
lindenbaum
does
not
generate
either
criminal
or
civil
liability
and
i
think
the
misidentification
of
mr.
wilson
does
not
generate
either
of
those
varieties
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
mr.
justice
stewart
--
i
mean
mr.
justice
douglas,
if
i
may
say
--
i
may
say
the
sanctions
have
been
specified
by
congress
and
the
fact
that
they
did
not
specify
this
sanction,
i
think
ought
to
mean
something
as
well
as
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
are
precatory
with,
if
i
may
say,
one
exception.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
courts
do
have
supervisory
powers
and
if
its
willful
or
if
it
continues
once
its
been
--
once
it
has
been
ruled
that
these
procedures
are
not
adequate
then
they’re
no
longer
precatory.
this
court
would
have
the
power
at
that
stage
to
begin
the
suppress
not
under
the
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
grounds
for
suppression
would
remain
the
same.
it
would
be
different
only
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
my
view
mr.
chief
justice,
if
a
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted
in
the
sense
that
we’ve
been
talking
about,
i
doubt
that
the
judge
has
any
discretion.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
i
would
think
he
had
no
discretion
there
either.
if
the
order
is
insufficient
on
its
face
i
think
the
evidence
must
be
suppressed
and
should
--
and
the
order
should
not
have
been
followed
by
the
man
who
went
out
and
apply
the
device
to
the
wire.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
if
he
doesn’t
follow
the
terms
of
the
order,
i
think
it
must
be
suppressed
as
well.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
if
2518
(10)
(a)
as
we
just
read
in
the
senate
report
here
a
moment
ago
on
page
39,
was
it
--
its
--
what
they
say
--
the
senate
said
that
2515
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
section
2518
(10)
(a).
i
think
2518
(10)
(a)
is
clearly
the
implementing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
terribly
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
one
has
to
discover
then
mr.
justice
brennan
what
disclosure
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter
and
then
you
get
back
to
the
suppression
provisions.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
question
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
the
2515
point
is
important
because
you
only
know
what
disclosure
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
in
violation
of
the
statute
by
knowing
what
may
not
be
disclosed.
that
is
what
may
--
must
be
suppressed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
douglas
i
think
there
is
an
echo
in
that
particularly
as
to
the
will
wilson
misidentification
issue.
i
--
but
i’m
but
--
it
is
a
harmless
error
for
this
reason.
no
constitutional
rights
were
violated.
no
wiretaps
occurred
that
would
not
otherwise
have
occurred.
the
evidence
is
accurate,
there’s
no
question
here
of
convicting
the
innocent
with
evidence
that
maybe
inaccurate.
and
there
was
no
deterrence
function
to
be
served
at
this
time.
these
are
abandoned
procedures,
the
department
of
justice
is
not
going
back
to
them.
there
was
no
purpose
in
them
in
the
first
place
except
a
mix
up
under
memorandum.
and
indeed
were
there
to
be
a
ruling
that
the
procedures
were
inadequate,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
every
reason
in
the
world
to
rule
that
--
that
ruling
had
prospective
application
only.
so,
there’s
no
deterrent
function
and
that
would’ve
--
that
would
adequately
serve
any
deterrent
function
there
was.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don’t
think
in
this
connection
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
would
make
any.
we
had
--
the
department
of
justice
had
excellent
reason
to
believe
that
mr.
mitchell
had
the
power
and
the
lawful
right
to
delegate
this
to
mr.
lindenbaum
and
perhaps
i
should
address
that
for
the
moment
because
this
certainly
goes
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
essentially
that
if
the
attorney
general
himself
made
the
decision
and
through
this
confusion
about
memorandum,
mr.
wilson’s
name
got
sent
out
when
it
shouldn’t
have,
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
error,
it
seems
to
be
that
it
shouldn’t
happen,
but
i
certainly
if
anything
is
harmless
error
that
is
--
there
is
certainly
no
reason
to
say
that
a
judge
who
has
found
all
the
constitutional
elements,
probable
cause,
need
for
wire
interception,
failure
of
other
techniques
and
so
forth
would
have
turned
down
the
application
had
he
been
told
that
the
attorney
general,
rather
than
the
assistant
attorney
general
has
authorized
it.
so
i
can’t
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
utterly
harmless
error.
but
on
the
lindenbaum-mitchell
delegation
which
i
think
is
the
next
question
that
follows
from
the
question
you
just
asked
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it’s
clear,
now
i’m
now
moving
from
the
argument
that
there
is
no
case
when
a
suppression
of
evidence.
and
if
there
were
a
case,
it
should
be
perspective
only
to
the
argument
that
in
fact
the
statute
was
complied
with
in
major
respects,
in
the
major
respects.
the
purpose
of
section
2516
(1)
which
is
the
section
that
governs
--
that
says
it
must
be
the
attorney
--
the
attorney
general
may
authorize
or
specially
designated
assistant
attorney
general
is
stated
in
language
in
the
senate
report
which
is
quoted
on
page
54
of
our
brief
in
the
giordano
case
and
the
purpose
is
to
centralize
policy
to
get
uniformity
of
policy
and
to
have
a
publicly
responsible
official.
i
think
both
of
those
purposes
were
completely
satisfied
when
the
attorney
general
said,
“when
i’m
unavailable,
mr.
lindenbaum
you
know
my
policies,
you
are
directly
in
the
attorney
general’s
office.
you
work
with
me
everyday,
when
i’m
unavailable
you
go
ahead
and
act.”
that
is,
that
purpose
is
served.
you
have
centralization,
a
unity
of
policy
and
you
have
mr.
mitchell
responsible.
now,
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
forbids
that
delegation.
i
think
rather
clearly
it
does
not
forbid
that
delegation.
you
have
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
at
page
60
and
this
is
by
no
means
our
only
reliance.
the
general
delegation
statute
for
the
department
of
justice,
28
u.s.c.
section
510,
it
gives
the
attorney
general
power
to
authorize
others
to
perform
any
function
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
law
generally
allows
delegations
of
this
sort.
we
have
cited
a
series
of
them
at
page
53
of
the
brief.
you
have
title
iii,
the
same
statute
we’re
dealing
with
here,
18
u.s.c.
2514
which
is
the
witness
immunity
statute
which
is
--
it’s
given
to
the
--
attorney
general
is
given
the
power
to
grant
a
witness
immunity
and
it
has
been
held
that
that
function
of
the
attorney
general,
given
to
the
attorney
general
by
the
statute
maybe
delegated.
you
have
i
think
an
even
clearer
example
in
the
second
paragraph
at
the
footnote
on
that
page,
in
the
case
of
jay
against
boyd
construing
8
u.s.c.
1254,
a
statute
which
says
that
the
attorney
general
“may
in
his
discretion”
suspend
the
part
--
deportation
of
any
alien.
that
language
seems
to
me
to
imply
even
more
than
the
language
in
the
statute
we’re
examining.
that
it
is
a
personal
decision
of
the
attorney
general
and
that
--
yet
this
court
has
held
that
that
statutory
power
maybe
delegated
and
in
kleindienst
against
mandel
which
is
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
that
footnote,
the
attorney
general
was
given
discretion
which
was
in
fact
in
that
case
exercised
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
he
delegated
it.
so
that
mr.
mitchell
and
mr.
lindenbaum
were
operating
against
the
background
of
statutes
was
a
general
delegation
statute
and
specific
other
statutes
giving
the
attorney
general
the
power
or
the
duty
to
do
things
which
had
been
delegated
in
which
delegations
have
been
upheld
in
the
past.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
think
to
this
extent.
i
think
there’s
a
limitation
obviously
but
i
think
the
limitation
is
best
read
as
to
the
office,
the
immediate
control
of
one
of
these
two
officials.
and
i
say
that
because
we
have
two
examples
in
our
brief
on
page
57
and
page
58
in
which
this
same
congress
had
provided
a
couple
of
months
before
that
something
must
be
done
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
deputy
attorney
general
which
parallels
the
language
we’re
talking
about
and
then
congress
went
on
and
said,
“which
function
may
not
be
delegated?”
now,
when
you
compare
that
with
the
language
here,
i
think
mr.
mitchell
and
mr.
lindenbaum
had
a
right
to
say,
here
as
an
attorney
general
and
a
deputy
attorney
general,
just
is
in
the
statute,
attorney
general
and
assistant
attorney
general.
in
the
civil
rights
act
they
say
it
may
not
be
delegated,
in
this
statute
they
don’t
say
it
which
i
think
gave
them
a
right
to
think
that
some
delegation
within
the
office
was
possible.
again,
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetics
act
which
we
discussed
on
page
50
has
the
same
kind
of
language
about
the
secretary
health,
education
and
welfare.
there
--
and
i
should
say
one
more
thing,
if
you
look,
if
one
looks
at
the
2516
(2),
we
see
that
congress
clearly
allows
hundreds
of
state
prosecutors
to
authorize
these
applications
and
in
fact,
in
the
legislative
history
which
we
quote
in
the
brief,
it
says
the
question
of
whether
the
state
officer
may
delegate,
state
attorney
general
may
delegate
will
be
controlled
by
the
law
of
delegation
of
the
state.
now,
that
takes
the
heart
out
of
this
argument
that
congress
was
so
concerned
that
the
attorney
general
himself
had
to
involve
himself
from
the
minutiae
of
every
application
for
a
wire
interception
order.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
was
a
draft
of
that
sort.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
that’s
correct
and
i
think
he
suggested
that
and
i
think
when
one
looks
at
that
against
the
law
of
delegation
and
the
su
--
and
the
law
of
no
delegation
which
congress
had
worked
out,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
they’re
talking
about
the
attorney
general
and
his
immediate
office
and
any
assistant
attorney
general
in
his
immediate
office
and
i
think
the
state
cases
indicate
the
same
policy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
very
curious
result
in
the
state
in
that
way
because
what
that
would
mean
is
that
congress
was
really
not
terribly
concerned
about
unitary
policies
of
any
kind.
they
were
more
suspicious
of
the
department
of
justice
of
the
federal
government
than
they
were
in
the
proliferation
of
state
and
local
and
county
governments
across
the
nation.
i
think
the
purpose
congress
had
was
in
unifying
policy,
they
did
not
mind
delegations
so
long
as
the
policy
was
unified
and
you
could
identify
the
man
who
was
responsible
even
though
it
delegated
it.
i
think
it’s
true
in
the
state
government,
i
think
that’s
true
in
the
federal
government
under
standard
delegation
law
that
we’ve
just
discussed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
when
i
said
delegation
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
i
meant
was
this
statutes
says
to
the
attorney
general,
unless
you
designate
an
assistant
attorney
general,
you
are
the
man
to
be
held
responsible
and
we
want
uniformity
of
policy
and
that
is
accomplished
when
he
takes
a
man
as
executive
assistant
whom
--
who
has
done
50
or
60
of
these
applications
and
says
now
you
know
my
policy,
when
i’m
unavailable,
act,
tell
me
when
i
get
back.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
consistent
with
what
we
mean
by,
it
limits
the
scope
of
delegation,
it
keeps
the
thing
within
a
narrow
campus.
it
seems
to
me,
given
the
state,
the
way
congress
treated
the
states,
it’s
the
much
more
realistic
reading
of
the
congressional
policy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it
might
have
been
better
mr.
justice
marshall
the
way
he
did
do
it
because
the
attorney
general
did
not
want
to
designate
any
assistant
attorney
general
to
exercise
this
operative
--
to
make
the
operative
decision.
he
thought
he
had
in
mr.
lindenbaum
and
in
fact,
he
did
have
in
mr.
lindenbaum,
a
man
who
would
follow
his
policies
exactly,
and
act
only
when
he
was
unavailable.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[attempt
to
laughter]
well,
it
varies
from
time
to
time
mr.
justice
marshall.
deputy
attorney
generals?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
run
around,
you
mean
are
there
irresponsible
assistant
attorney
generals?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
not
in
day-to-day
contact.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
do
indeed
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
wilson?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
apparently,
mr.
wilson
had
very
--
one
might
say
minimal
involvement
in
any
of
these
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
his
deputies
were
mr.
peterson,
mr.
shapiro
were
greatly
involved
as
the
memorandum
were
going
up,
they
approved
them.
but
the
operative
decision
was
mr.
mitchell’s
except
in
those
cases
where
he
was
unavailable
and
then
it
was
mr.
lindenbaum
carrying
out
mr.
mitchell’s
policies
and
i
think
mr.
mitchell
thought
that
that
was
greater
control
over
the
decision
than
it
would
have
been
had
he
designated
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
the
executive
assistant
acts
in
many
ways
for
the
attorney
general
on
routine
matters
when
he
understands
the
attorney
general’s
policy
in
many
cases
which
is
another
reason,
pardon
me,
which
is
another
reason
why
they
thought
this
was
perfectly
acceptable.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
within
the
organized
crime
section
of
the
criminal
division.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
didn’t
have
any
autonomy
in
that
sense.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
not
autonomy
mr.
chief
justice,
they
were
specialized
and
it
was
their
specialized
function
to
make
the
initial
review
of
these
matters
before
sending
it
up
the
hierarchy
through
the
criminal
division
but
they
had
no
autonomy.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
two
cases,
united
states
against
giordano
and
united
against
--
united
states
against
chavez
which
involves
the
suppression
of
wire
interception
evidence
and
the
fruits
of
that
evidence
in
narcotics
cases.
the
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
and
ninth
circuits
respectively.
in
both
cases
the
district
court
suppressed
the
evidence
applying
title
iii
of
the
organized
--
of
the
title
iii
of
the
safe
streets
statute
and
this
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
this
court
granted
the
government
petition
for
certiorari.
these
two
cases
represent
a
great
many
cases.
some
of
them
pending
here
on
petitions
for
certiorari
and
others
awaiting
resolution
in
lower
courts
being
held
up.
the
issue
as
the
government
sees
it
is
entirely
a
statutory
one.
it’s
a
--
the
construction
of
title
iii
of
the
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968
and
the
government's
--
the
propriety,
the
adequacy
of
the
government’s
procedures
in
processing
applications
to
courts
for
orders
permitting
wire
interception.
the
--
in
addition
to
the
adequacy
of
those
procedures,
the
cases
raise
the
question
of
whether
assuming
the
procedures
were
in
some
degree
defective,
suppression
is
the
remedy
called
for.
at
the
outset
i’d
like
to
stress
what
these
cases
are
not
about.
there
are
no
constitutional
violations
in
our
view
in
these
cases,
no
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
those
provisions
of
this
statute
which
were
going
to
comply
with
this
court’s
decisions
in
the
burger
and
cass
were
fully
complied
with.
courts
did
pass
upon
probable
cause
and
all
other
fourth
amendment
elements.
there’s
no
contention
nor
i
think
could
there
be
any,
but
the
evidence
that
has
been
suppressed
is
not
reliable
evidence,
there
is
not
accurate
evidence.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
--
in
these
cases
of
convicting
innocent
persons.
i
think
as
we
look
at
the
case
and
the
facts,
it
will
also
become
perfectly
plain
that
the
government’s
procedures
which
in
one
or
two
respects
certainly
must
be
said
to
be
not
the
best
compliance
with
some
aspects
of
the
statute,
do
not
display
any
malevolent
purpose.
there
was
no
sinister
purpose,
there
was
no
purpose
of
hiding
anything
in
these
procedures
and
i
think
insofar
as
there
was
a
deviation
from
a
procedure,
we
can
just
--
we
can
demonstrate
that
it
was
a
harmless
error
and
an
error
i
might
add
which
is
now
have
been
corrected.
let
me
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it’s
been
corrected
for
some
time
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
70
--
1972,
the
last
correction
took
place
in
november,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
every
one
of
these
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
there
was
a
letter
authorizing
an
application
which
went
out
over
the
signature
of
mr.
will
wilson,
then
head
of
the
criminal
division.
the
letter
looked
as
if
mr.
will
wilson
had
made
the
operative
decision
to
authorize
the
application
to
the
court.
as
a
result,
the
court
orders
identified
mr.
wilson
as
the
person
who
had
authorized
the
application.
in
fact,
those
applications
had
been
authorized
either
by
the
attorney
general
in
most
cases
and
in
some
cases
by
the
executive
assistant,
the
attorney
general
mr.
sullivan
involved.
that
was
a
result
entirely
as
i
hope
to
show
of
the
way
the
internal
memorandum
were
drafted
in
the
department
of
justice
and
was
not
a
deliberate
misidentification
in
any
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
had
accurate
information
as
to
everything
except,
mr.
wilson’s
name.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
has,
i
think
it
has
importance
under
the
statute.
i
don’t
think
it
has
any
importance
that
we
justify
suppression
in
these
cases.
perhaps,
it
would
help
i
can
describe
the
general
procedures
that
were
followed
in
all
of
these
cases
and
the
statutory
provisions
that
are
claimed
to
be
violated
by
that
fact
and
then
come
to
the
particular
facts
of
these
two
cases.
when
it
was
thought
by
an
investigator
or
a
field
attorney
that
a
wire
interception
order
was
required
or
was
appropriate,
he
would
then
gather
together
the
information
and
affidavits
and
the
application
to
show
probable
cause,
the
necessity
for
the
use
of
wire
interception
as
a
technique
and
the
other
aspects
of
the
statute
calls
for.
he
would
forward
that
to
washington.
in
washington,
it
was
reviewed
by
an
attorney
in
the
special
unit
of
the
organized
crime
and
racketeering
section
of
the
criminal
division,
a
special
unit
setup
just
for
this
purpose.
that
was
the
main
review.
it
then
went
with
the
memorandum
from
the
attorney
in
that
unit
to
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
a
criminal
division
whereby
designation
it
was
reviewed
by
one
of
the
two
deputies,
one
of
the
two
deputies,
attorney
general’s
mr.
shapiro
or
mr.
peterson
at
that
time.
should
they
approve
and
i
should
stress
that
at
every
level,
disapproval
meant
it
was
sent
back.
it
did
not
--
if
anybody
disapproved,
it
did
the
applic
--
the
authorization
--
that
request
did
not
go
on
and
a
number
of
them
were
in
fact
sent
back.
should
they
approve
the
application
and
the
memo
were
sent
up
to
the
attorney
general’s
office
where
it
was
reviewed
by
the
executive
assistant
mr.
sol
lindenbaum,
who
was
been
the
executive
assistant
to
the
attorney’s
general
starting
with
attorney
general
mr.
ramsey
clark
and
is
still
the
executive
assistant
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
lindenbaum
would
review
it
and
then
send
it
on
to
the
attorney
general,
mr.
mitchell
with
his
recommendation.
through
1969
when
this
practice
--
when
the
experience
with
the
statute
first
began,
33
such
applications
were
authorized
by
mr.
mitchell
personally.
mr.
lindenbaum
in
1969
did
not
attaches
mr.
mitchell’s
initials
to
any.
they
were
all
--
everyone
was
done
by
mr.
mitchell.
as
1970
began
and
the
flow
of
these
applications
begin
to
increase
and
mr.
mitchell
began
to
do
some
traveling.
as
close
as
we
can
calculate
it,
about
april
1st,
1970
after
there
had
been
some
further
experience
beyond
the
33
applications
in
1969,
mr.
mitchell
authorized
orally
mr.
lindenbaum
to
act
on
his
behalf
when
mr.
mitchell
was
out
--
was
unavailable
and
could
not
be
reached
by
telephone
with
the
statement
that
when
he
returned,
mr.
lindenbaum
was
to
tell
him
what
he’d
done
in
this
respects
and
he
would
then
see
whether
he
approved
as
he
did
in
all
of
these
cases.
now
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
--
if
he
hadn’t
approve,
i
assume
that
the
interception
would
have
terminated.
but
mr.
lindenbaum
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
for
the
month,
mr.
justice
stewart,
correct.
i
want
to
--
i
wish
to
say
however
that
mr.
lindenbaum
was
operating
under
a
policy
established
by
mr.
mitchell
and
that
he
had
worked
on
these
things
with
mr.
mitchell
for
some
time
before
he
began
to
do
this
and
i
think
that
was
no
question
and
he
understood
the
policy
mr.
mitchell
was
applying.
and
i
should
also
stress
although
i’m
afraid
that
something
stressed
repeatedly,
that
although
the
interception
would
have
taken
place,
had
such
a
thing
occurred,
it
would
have
only
taken
place
after
a
court
had
determined
that
every
element
of
probable
cause
and
every
other
required
element
was
present.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
under
your
hypothetical
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
under
your
hypothetical
that
would
be
true.
however,
that
did
not
happen
and
these
procedures
are
no
longer
in
effect
so
it
cannot
happen.
now,
the
--
about
a
150
to
180
of
these
applications
out
of
--
appeared
to
have
been
initialed
by
mr.
lindenbaum
with
mr.
mitchell’s
signature.
now,
that’s
out
of
a
total
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
the
1971
when
these
practice
was
first
questioned
in
court
because
the
department
of
justice
said
no
inkling,
anybody,
they're
being
troublesome
about
this
practice.
when
they
were
first
questioned
in
the
court,
they
changed
it.
but
i
wish
to
say,
about
those
170
or
so
applications
that
were
authored
by
--
authorized
by
mr.
lindenbaum
putting
mr.
mitchell’s
signatures
on
the
memorandum,
that
a
great
many
of
those
were
in
fact
applications
that
had
been
authorized
by
mr.
mitchell
over
the
telephone.
mr.
lindenbaum
had
gotten
to
him
over
the
telephone,
had
read
hem
the
stuff
and
read
him
the
material
and
had
received
mr.
mitchell’s
approval.
and
so
that
mr.
lindenbaum
was
performing
in
those
cases
a
ministerial
act
only
of
doing
what
mr.
mitchell
conformed
we
should
do.
unfortunately,
mr.
lindenbaum
did
not
keep
a
record
of
the
telephone
calls
so
that
we
in
every
case
in
which
mr.
lindenbaum
put
mr.
mitchell
signatures
on
the
memorandum,
we
must
assume
that
that
maybe
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
telephone
authorization.
although
we
know
that
a
great
many
of
them
were
in
fact
authorized
by
telephone.
it’s
at
this
stage
that
the
first
problem
of
--
or
claim
of
violation
of
the
statute
occurs
because
in
title
iii,
18
u.s.c
2516,
it
is
provided
that
the
attorney
general
or
any
assistant
attorney
general
specially
designated
by
the
attorney
general
may
authorize
an
application
to
a
federal
judge.
and
the
claim
is
that
when
mr.
lindenbaum,
the
executive
assistant
applying
the
policy
laid
down
for
him
by
the
attorney
general
authorized
that
that
falls
outside
the
statute.
now,
the
second
issue
arises
because
of
the
form
of
the
memorandum
that
mr.
lindenbaum
or
mr.
mitchell
in
most
cases
actually
initialed.
the
form
of
the
memorandum
was
draft
--
the
memorandum
was
drafted
so
as
to
track
the
statute.
that
memorandum
was
drafted
by
so
far
as
we
can
tell
by
an
attorney
in
the
special
unit
which
first
reviews
these
things
and
send
up
with
the
file
from
mr.
mitchell
to
authorize
it.
and
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
special
delegation
so
that
when
the
memorandum
was
initialed,
it
went
back
down
to
the
criminal
division,
addressed
to
mr.
wilson
saying
pursuant
to
the
powers
conferred
on
me
by
section
2516
of
title
18,
you
are
hereby
specially
designated
to
exercise
those
powers
for
the
purpose
of
authorizing,
the
particular
trial
attorney,
to
make
the
above
described
application.
he’s
delegate
--
he’s
designated
solely
for
the
purpose
of
authorizing
it
so
that
it’s
understood
that
mr.
wilson
is
to
perform
a
ministerial
act.
he’s
not
designated
to
make
any
judgment.
in
fact
the
judgment
of
the
criminal
division
had
already
been
made
when
the
file
was
on
its
way
up
or
it
wouldn’t
have
gone
up.
the
net
result
was,
when
that
memorandum
went
down,
this
ministerial
act
of
affixing
a
--
mr.
wilson’s
signature
to
a
letter
was
performed
by
one
of
his
two
deputies,
both
of
whom
were
authorized
to
do
this
in
a
number
of
matters
to
mr.
henry
peterson
and
mr.
harold
shapiro.
the
letter
went
out,
as
we
have
noted,
looking
as
if
mr.
wilson
had
made
the
operative
decision
when
in
fact
the
attorney
general
had
made
the
operative
decision
or
in
some
cases,
the
attorney
general’s
executive
assistant.
and
the
attorney
in
the
field
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
about
this
memorandum
in
its
form
and
why
does
it
occur,
so
he
would
assume,
usually
that
mr.
will
wilson
had
made
the
operative
decision.
and
he
would
so
tell
the
court
and
it
is
claimed
there
and
the
court
would
include
that
fact
in
its
order
and
the
claim
therefore
is
that
section
2518
of
title
18
which
provides
that
each
application
shall
include
the
following
information;
(a)
the
identity
of
the
author
authorizing
the
application
and
in
4
(d);
the
identity
of
the
person
authorizing
the
application
must
be
in
the
judge’s
order,
the
wire
intercept
order.
in
all
of
these
cases
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
--
in
every
one
of
these
wire
intercept
order,
some
500
of
them,
mr.
wilson’s
name
appears,
criminal
division,
because
of
this
memorandum
and
forums
that
were
used
in
the
department.
there
is
no
--
all
of
the
cases
involved
what
we
call
the
will
wilson
issue
because
of
that
formal
letter
going
out.
only
some
of
the
cases
involved
the
question
of
the
delegation
by
mr.
mitchell
to
mr.
lindenbaum
of
the
authority.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
nobody
caught
it.
in
fact
mr.
justice
white
when
we
caught
--
when
the
department
caught
the
delegation
problem
because
litigation
arose
of
it,
the
delegation
from
mr.
mitchell
to
mr.
lindenbaum,
they
corrected
that.
they
didn’t
look
at
the
other
form
and
that
continued
until
litigation
began
over
that
form.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
right.
and
the
--
these
forms
--
this
was
a
new
statute,
when
mr.
mitchell
started
to
apply
it
working
with
the
statute,
hadn’t
been
used
before
and
that
there
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
--
some
of
this
relevant
positions
had
been
propositions,
had
been,
yes,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
did
identify
that
man,
that
was
the
trial
attorney,
or
the
investigator.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
they
did
not
invest
--
they
did
not
correctly
identify
the
officer
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
authorizing
the
application.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
will
wilson
certainly
never
signed
the
letter
and
the
best
that
can
be
said
about
the
authorization
procedure
is
that
if
delegation
is
permissible
in
this
area,
point
that
i
would
come
to,
he
had
delegated
on
the
way
up
the
power
to
approve
the
application
to
his
deputies,
two
deputies,
mr.
peterson
and
mr.
shapiro
and
they
did
approve
them
on
the
way
up.
when
the
memo
came
back
down,
mr.
wilson
made
no
operative
decision
and
neither
did
his
deputies
at
that
stage.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don’t
-
-
i
think
whether
the
--
used
the
stamp
or
facsimile,
i
don’t
know,
but
they
did
put
on
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
yes.
in
fact
that
there
are
many
as
i
intend
to
state,
there
are
many
cases
in
which
delegations
of
this
sort
or
authorizations
to
[inaudible].
in
the
case
of
mr.
wilson,
when
the
memorandum
came
back
down,
i
believe
it’s
quite
clearly
a
ministerial
act
at
that
stage
and
the
only
problem,
there’s
no
question
about
the
authority
to
put
on
the
name,
the
only
problem
is
that
when
it
--
when
the
letter
goes
out
that
way,
the
attorney
in
the
field
tells
the
court
that
mr.
wilson
made
the
operative
decision
when
in
fact
mr.
mitchell
made
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
only
meant
with
that
mr.
justice
douglas
was
that
the
fact
that
somebody
else
signed
mr.
wilson’s
signature,
i
think
was
ministerial.
the
fact
that
the
signature
should
not
have
been
there
as
the
person
authorizing
is
not
ministerial,
that’s
more
substantive.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
don’t
think
there
was
any
delegation
of
a
signing
of
subpoenas.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
had
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
had
the
letter
said,
this
letter
was
only
notifying
the
trial
attorney,
had
the
letter
said,
the
attorney
general
has
authorized
this
as
was
the
case
and
had
mr.
peterson
signed
mr.
wilson’s
name
to
a
statement
that
the
attorney
general
authorized
it,
i
don’t
think
there
would
have
been
any
problem,
that
would
have
been
a
ministerial
act.
the
problem
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
now,
the
problem
is,
the
identification
of
the
authorizing
officer,
not
the
affixing
of
the
signature.
not
the
question
of
which
person
affixed
the
signature.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
said
mr.
justice
white
that
you
are
specially
designated
to
act
in
this
matter
for
the
purpose
of
authorizing
the
application.
pursuant
to
the
powers
conferred
on
me
by
section
2516,
you
are
hereby
specially
designated
to
exercise
those
powers
for
the
purpose
of
authorizing
the
trial
attorney
to
make
the
above
described
application.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
were
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
unless
inquiry
was
made
mr.
justice
marshall
as
it
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
they
would
not.
i
think
however
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
fact
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
in
some
cases
the
executive
assistant
was
doing
it,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
the
--
in
no
case
was
the
judge
told
that
the
attorney
general
did
it.
he
was
always
told
that
mr.
wilson
did
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
even
in
the
case
when
the
attorney
general
was
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
--
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
that
some
of
these
cases,
but
i
might
say
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that’s
not
an
uncommon
situation
in
which
the
attorney
general
delegates
certain
functions
that
are
specified
by
statute
as
being
attorney
general’s
functions.
and
often,
nobody
knows
that
in
fact
the
operative
decision
was
made
by
someone
other
than
the
attorney
general.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
intend
to
discuss
at
some
length
of
fact.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
won’t
answer
it
now,
to
--
i
didn’t
mean
to
put
a
--
i
didn’t
mean
to
put
it
off.
i
just
meant
to
indicate
my
answer
which
is
that
i
think
nobody’s
right
of
privacy
was
interfered
with
in
these
cases
in
any
way.
these
were
all
cases
in
which
every
fourth
amendment
right
was
observed
and
in
which
in
fact
mr.
lindenbaum
applied
mr.
mitchell’s
policy
and
nothing
would
have
changed
had
mr.
mitchell
been
there.
same
interceptions
would
have
occurred.
the
same
findings
of
probable
cause
would
have
been
made.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
issue
comes
down
to
that,
certainly
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
it’s
neither
a
statutory
violation
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
delegation
from
mr.
mitchell
to
mr.
lindenbaum
nor
do
i
think
there
is
any
case
in
the
statute
or
elsewhere
for
suppression
of
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
indeed
--
i
will
come
to
that
and
indeed
in
terms
of
the
delegation
by
mr.
mitchell
to
mr.
lindenbaum,
i
would
contend
that
the
statutory
purposes
are
carried
out
precisely.
there
is
a
unitary
policy.
it
was
established
by
mr.
mitchell
and
mr.
lindenbaum
understood
it
and
carried
it
out
very
well
and
in
fact
the
attorney
general
was
responsible
and
there
has
been
no
question
about
fixing
the
responsibility
to
him.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
--
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
the
2518
(1)
and
(4)
(d)
question.
i
was
addressing
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--
2516
question
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
let
me
come
to
the
--
i
suppose
since
these
cases
are
so
general
in
their
impact,
i
need
not
perhaps
detail
particular
facts
of
this
case
and
how
it
happened
in
the
giordano
case.
mr.
lindenbaum
did
authorize
the
first
application.
when
the
time
came
seven
days
later,
i
believe
it
was
for
the
extension
order,
mr.
mitchell
was
back
in
the
office,
saw
what
had
been
done
and
signed
and
authorized
the
application
for
an
extension.
one
could
see
i
think
ratification
in
that,
but
the
issue
is
far
more
general
than
simply
this
one
case.
although
i
heard
that
when
one
case
but
not
others,
but
let
me
--
the
issue
is
quite
general.
the
issue
of
mr.
mitchell’s
delegation
to
mr.
lindenbaum,
the
2516
(1)
case
affects
60
cases
with
626
defendants.
the
issue
of
mr.
wilson
being
identified
as
the
authorizing
officer
which
is
the
2518
issue
affects
159
cases
with
1433
defendants.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
they
overlap
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
was
about
to
say
all
of
the
mitchell,
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
all
of
the
mitchell-lindenbaum
cases
are
also,
wilson,
a
few
cases
so
that
the
outside
figure
is
1433
defendants
in
these
organized
crime
cases.
there
are
525
applications
for
orders
which
are
at
stake.
in
fact
2
years
work
of
organized
crime
section
is
at
stake
in
these
cases.
i’ve
said
that
the
procedures
here
are
no
longer
in
use.
i
should
say
that
up
until
--
when
this
was
recognized
as
an
issue,
there
would
be
in
litigation,
they
moved
immediately
to
a
case
where
the
attorney
general
made
the
authorization.
the
paper
shows
he
made
the
authorization
and
the
court
has
told
that.
recently,
special
delegation
--
special
designation
has
been
made
to
mr.
henry
peterson,
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
criminal
division
and
he
is
now
making
the
authorizations.
we
argue
this
case
a
little
bit
in
reverse
of
what
would
seem
to
be
usual
order.
that
is
we
usually
argue,
we
didn’t
violate
a
statute,
but
if
we
argue
suppression.
we
argued
suppression
first
in
this
case
not
because
of
any
particular
doubt
about
the
or
feeling
of
weakness
about
the
statutory
argument
because
as
we
looked
at
it
we
felt
the
weight
of
this
case
is
not
our
desire
to
sustain
these
procedures
for
the
future.
they
are
of
no
value.
they
were
accidental
procedures
that
came
about
by
the
way
the
memorandum
were
drafted.
the
weight
of
this
case
is
the
preservation
of
all
of
these
prosecutions
against
defendants
as
to
which
they
government
feels
it
has
a
very
good
case
and
that
is
why
we
argued
the
suppression
point
first
to
indicate
what
the
government
perceives
as
the
importance
of
these
cases.
i
confess
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
any
case
for
the
suppression
of
vital
evidence
and
accurate
evidence
in
this
class
of
cases.
i
think
i
have
sufficiently
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
think
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
suppression
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
operative
provision.
no
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
the
disclosure
provision
goes
back
to
in
violation
of
the
subsection
and
so
forth
and
i
think
you
finally
have
to
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
you
have
to
go
to
2518
(10)
to
see
what
will
sustain
a
motion
to
suppress.
and
any
aggrieved
person
may
move
to
suppress
on
the
grounds
that;
(1)
the
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted,
the
court
below
said
that
that
applied
here.
(2)
the
order
of
authorization
or
approval
under
which
it
was
intercepted
is
insufficient
on
its
face
and
the
court
in
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
that
applied
here.
now,
i
don’t
think
those
provisions
can
be
read.
the
first
provision
i
think
can
--
the
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted
most
certainly
cannot
be
read
to
say
that
if
any
provision
of
this
title
was
deviated
from
in
any
way
a
suppression
is
called
for
because
it’s
an
unlawful
interception.
if
you
read
it
that
way,
there
would
certainly
be
no
reason
to
have
two
or
three
that
the
order
is
insufficient
on
its
face
or
that
the
interception
is
not
made
in
conformity
with
the
order
because
those
are
all
violations
of
the
statute
too.
and
further
more,
it
would
be
very
easy
to
draft
a
statute,
to
say
anytime
you
deviate,
the
evidence
is
suppressed.
that
is
not
what
was
done.
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
on
page
39
of
our
brief,
we
quote
the
senate
report.
in
page
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
this
is
in
giordano,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
39.
we
quote
the
senate
report,
it
is
quoted
also
on
page
29
of
respondent
giordano’s
brief
but
i
think
the
passage
quoted
in
that
brief
cuts
off
both
the
–
trivial
too
soon.
the
provision,
section
2515
must
be
read,
the
senate
reports
says,
“in
light
of
section
2518
(10)
(a),”
which
is
the
point
we
have
just
been
making.
“it
largely
reflects
existing
law.”
then
further
down
it
says,
“there
is
no
intention
to
change
the
attenuation
rule
nor
generally
to
press
the
scope
of
the
suppression
rule
beyond
present
search
and
seizure
law.”
i
think
that
reading
of
legislative
history
supports
the
statutory
analysis
i
have
just
suggested
that
if
you
look
at
2518
(10)
(a),
one
obviously
means
the
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted.
i
think
that
means
under
present
search
and
seizure
law,
it
protects
fourth
amendment
values.
it
extends
fourth
amendment
values
in
one
respect
because
it
extends
them
to
grand
jury
proceedings
and
so
forth
where
the
fourth
amendment
might
not
otherwise
apply.
now,
i
don’t
think
the
misidentification
of
will
wilson
as
the
person
who
made
the
operative
decision
nor
the
delegation
in
some
cases
to
sol
lindenbaum
can
be
made
into
a
fourth
amendment
value
and
therefore
i
don’t
think
the
first
point
here
can
conceivably
be
used
to
suppress
the
evidence
of
these
cases.
if
you
go
on
to
the
second
point,
it
says
the
order
of
authorization
or
approval
under
which
it
was
intercepted
is
insufficient
on
its
face.
the
court
of
appeals
said
a
rather
peculiar
thing
i
think.
it
said
that
once
you
realize
that
will
wilson
didn’t
make
the
authorization
which
you
find
out
by
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing,
then
you’re
entitled
to
take
his
name
out
of
the
order,
that
leaves
the
blank
in
the
order
and
at
that
point
it
becomes
insufficient
on
its
face.
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
meaning
in
law
of
insufficiency
on
the
face
of
the
order.
that
order
was
not
insufficient
on
its
face.
it
recited
a
man
who
could
have
been
and
was
specially
designated
and
the
order
was
valid
on
its
face.
i
don’t
know
how
one
can
find
the
facial
invalidity
by
holding
a
hearing
to
find
out
if
the
underlying
facts
are
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
right
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
one
has
to
look
at
it
--
i
think
what
this
too
is,
is
obviously
a
back
stop
to
one.
the
--
(1)
says
of
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted.
(2)
says
insufficient
on
its
face.
that
means
that
the
man
who
receives
the
order
is
to
go
out
and
conduct
the
wire
interception.
if
he
looks
at
the
order
and
he
sees
that
it’s
wrong
on
its
face,
he’s
got
no
business
going
forward,
he
had
to
go
back
and
find
out
why
it’s
wrong.
and
that
of
course,
(3)
is
the
--
he
must
follow
the
order.
so
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no.
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
no
court
has
said
the
three
is
involved
here.
i
can’t
understand
the
facial
invalidity
argument.
respondent's
brief
in
the
giordano
case
cites
some
cases
which
do
not
seem
to
me
as
i
read
and
to
discuss
the
on
its
face
language,
but
in
fact
are
cases
that
say
that
you
may
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
find
out
that
a
witness
who
swore
to
probable
cause,
factual
and
probable
cause
was
not
the
right
witness
or
did
not
have
the
facts
and
so
forth,
the
cases
i
think
which
are
totally
in
apposite
to
the
construction
of
this
language
in
the
statute
about
invalidity
on
the
face
of
it.
i
think
that
when
one
gets
away
--
oh!
i
should
add
i
think
that
this
reading
not
only
comports
with
standard
statutory
analysis
and
what
the
indication
of
legislative
intent
that
we
have,
it
also
makes
common
sense
because
of
the
criminal
penalties
for
wrongful
disclosure
and
because
of
the
civil
liability
or
wrongful
disclosure.
it
seems
to
me
that
we’re
talking
about
fourth
amendment
values
privacy
in
those
areas
and
that’s
what
the
suppression
provisions
are
talking
about
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
but
--
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
i
would
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
in
cases
of
willful
misleading
of
a
court,
this
court
might
care
to
use
its
supervisory
powers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
that’s
the
core
of
the
point.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
would
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
that
in
a
case
where
the
investigator
you
mentioned
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
did
an
intention
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
it
was
in
good
faith
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
i
would
--
i
think
i
have
to
say
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
suppression
provisions
do
not
apply
to
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
congress
could
apply
them
at
any
time.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
terms
of
the
statute,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
terms
of
the
statute
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
probably
correct.
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
possibility
that
a
willful
violation
of
the
statute
might
be
read
either
under
one
as
a
reason
for
suppression
or
that
the
court
might
use
its
supervisory
powers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
i
would
like.
if
i
may
to
reserve
the
possibility
that
willful
violation
of
the
statute,
one
that
was
done
with
the
bad
motive
to
achieve
a
result
that
could
or
what
would
be
achieved.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
to
achieve
a
result
that
couldn't
otherwise
be
achieved.
i
should
point
out
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
that
would
certainly
mr.
chief
justice
be
a
violation
of
one.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
a
case
in
which
the
probable
cause
was
absent.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
certainly
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
certainly
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there
are
wide
varieties
of
situation
in
which
this
would
apply.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
for
example,
i
would
think
failure
to
minimize
the
number
of
interceptions,
failure
to
terminate
when
you
got
the
evidence
that
you’re
suppose
to
get.
i
think
those
are
all
cases
which
would
come
under
number
one.
there
are
a
great
many
of
them.
i
don’t
think
the
situation
we
have
here
today
is,
unless
one
reads
number
one
to
say
that
any
deviation
from
any
provision
of
the
statute
requires
suppression
and
i
don’t
think
one
can
read
it
that
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
they
lie
primarily
with
congress.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
i
meant
by
that
was
that
if
the
congress
wishes
to
add
a
sanction
that’s
where
the
sanction
should
come
from.
should
the
government,
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
should
the
government
having
once
realized
that
its
procedure,
well
i’m
unassuming
now
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
procedures
are
deficient,
should
the
government
once
realized
that
those
procedures
are
deficient
and
continue
with
the
process
then
i
think
i
would
have
no
particular
difficulty
in
saying
that
a
court
faced
with
that
kind
of
government
intransitives
ought
to
apply
as
a
supervisory
matter,
suppression.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
stewart
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
as
a
willful
disclosure
of
a
kind
that
the
statute
forbids
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
isn’t.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
i
doubt
mr.
justice
douglas
that
i
would
think
that
the
delegation
from
this
--
i’m
sure
i
would
think
that
the
delegation
from
mr.
mitchell
and
mr.
lindenbaum
does
not
generate
either
criminal
or
civil
liability
and
i
think
the
misidentification
of
mr.
wilson
does
not
generate
either
of
those
varieties
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
mr.
justice
stewart
--
i
mean
mr.
justice
douglas,
if
i
may
say
--
i
may
say
the
sanctions
have
been
specified
by
congress
and
the
fact
that
they
did
not
specify
this
sanction,
i
think
ought
to
mean
something
as
well
as
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
are
precatory
with,
if
i
may
say,
one
exception.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
courts
do
have
supervisory
powers
and
if
its
willful
or
if
it
continues
once
its
been
--
once
it
has
been
ruled
that
these
procedures
are
not
adequate
then
they’re
no
longer
precatory.
this
court
would
have
the
power
at
that
stage
to
begin
the
suppress
not
under
the
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
grounds
for
suppression
would
remain
the
same.
it
would
be
different
only
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
my
view
mr.
chief
justice,
if
a
communication
was
unlawfully
intercepted
in
the
sense
that
we’ve
been
talking
about,
i
doubt
that
the
judge
has
any
discretion.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
i
would
think
he
had
no
discretion
there
either.
if
the
order
is
insufficient
on
its
face
i
think
the
evidence
must
be
suppressed
and
should
--
and
the
order
should
not
have
been
followed
by
the
man
who
went
out
and
apply
the
device
to
the
wire.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
if
he
doesn’t
follow
the
terms
of
the
order,
i
think
it
must
be
suppressed
as
well.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
if
2518
(10)
(a)
as
we
just
read
in
the
senate
report
here
a
moment
ago
on
page
39,
was
it
--
its
--
what
they
say
--
the
senate
said
that
2515
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
section
2518
(10)
(a).
i
think
2518
(10)
(a)
is
clearly
the
implementing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
terribly
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
one
has
to
discover
then
mr.
justice
brennan
what
disclosure
would
be
in
violation
of
this
chapter
and
then
you
get
back
to
the
suppression
provisions.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
question
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
the
2515
point
is
important
because
you
only
know
what
disclosure
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
in
violation
of
the
statute
by
knowing
what
may
not
be
disclosed.
that
is
what
may
--
must
be
suppressed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
douglas
i
think
there
is
an
echo
in
that
particularly
as
to
the
will
wilson
misidentification
issue.
i
--
but
i’m
but
--
it
is
a
harmless
error
for
this
reason.
no
constitutional
rights
were
violated.
no
wiretaps
occurred
that
would
not
otherwise
have
occurred.
the
evidence
is
accurate,
there’s
no
question
here
of
convicting
the
innocent
with
evidence
that
maybe
inaccurate.
and
there
was
no
deterrence
function
to
be
served
at
this
time.
these
are
abandoned
procedures,
the
department
of
justice
is
not
going
back
to
them.
there
was
no
purpose
in
them
in
the
first
place
except
a
mix
up
under
memorandum.
and
indeed
were
there
to
be
a
ruling
that
the
procedures
were
inadequate,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
every
reason
in
the
world
to
rule
that
--
that
ruling
had
prospective
application
only.
so,
there’s
no
deterrent
function
and
that
would’ve
--
that
would
adequately
serve
any
deterrent
function
there
was.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don’t
think
in
this
connection
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
would
make
any.
we
had
--
the
department
of
justice
had
excellent
reason
to
believe
that
mr.
mitchell
had
the
power
and
the
lawful
right
to
delegate
this
to
mr.
lindenbaum
and
perhaps
i
should
address
that
for
the
moment
because
this
certainly
goes
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
essentially
that
if
the
attorney
general
himself
made
the
decision
and
through
this
confusion
about
memorandum,
mr.
wilson’s
name
got
sent
out
when
it
shouldn’t
have,
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
error,
it
seems
to
be
that
it
shouldn’t
happen,
but
i
certainly
if
anything
is
harmless
error
that
is
--
there
is
certainly
no
reason
to
say
that
a
judge
who
has
found
all
the
constitutional
elements,
probable
cause,
need
for
wire
interception,
failure
of
other
techniques
and
so
forth
would
have
turned
down
the
application
had
he
been
told
that
the
attorney
general,
rather
than
the
assistant
attorney
general
has
authorized
it.
so
i
can’t
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that’s
utterly
harmless
error.
but
on
the
lindenbaum-mitchell
delegation
which
i
think
is
the
next
question
that
follows
from
the
question
you
just
asked
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it’s
clear,
now
i’m
now
moving
from
the
argument
that
there
is
no
case
when
a
suppression
of
evidence.
and
if
there
were
a
case,
it
should
be
perspective
only
to
the
argument
that
in
fact
the
statute
was
complied
with
in
major
respects,
in
the
major
respects.
the
purpose
of
section
2516
(1)
which
is
the
section
that
governs
--
that
says
it
must
be
the
attorney
--
the
attorney
general
may
authorize
or
specially
designated
assistant
attorney
general
is
stated
in
language
in
the
senate
report
which
is
quoted
on
page
54
of
our
brief
in
the
giordano
case
and
the
purpose
is
to
centralize
policy
to
get
uniformity
of
policy
and
to
have
a
publicly
responsible
official.
i
think
both
of
those
purposes
were
completely
satisfied
when
the
attorney
general
said,
“when
i’m
unavailable,
mr.
lindenbaum
you
know
my
policies,
you
are
directly
in
the
attorney
general’s
office.
you
work
with
me
everyday,
when
i’m
unavailable
you
go
ahead
and
act.”
that
is,
that
purpose
is
served.
you
have
centralization,
a
unity
of
policy
and
you
have
mr.
mitchell
responsible.
now,
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
forbids
that
delegation.
i
think
rather
clearly
it
does
not
forbid
that
delegation.
you
have
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
at
page
60
and
this
is
by
no
means
our
only
reliance.
the
general
delegation
statute
for
the
department
of
justice,
28
u.s.c.
section
510,
it
gives
the
attorney
general
power
to
authorize
others
to
perform
any
function
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
law
generally
allows
delegations
of
this
sort.
we
have
cited
a
series
of
them
at
page
53
of
the
brief.
you
have
title
iii,
the
same
statute
we’re
dealing
with
here,
18
u.s.c.
2514
which
is
the
witness
immunity
statute
which
is
--
it’s
given
to
the
--
attorney
general
is
given
the
power
to
grant
a
witness
immunity
and
it
has
been
held
that
that
function
of
the
attorney
general,
given
to
the
attorney
general
by
the
statute
maybe
delegated.
you
have
i
think
an
even
clearer
example
in
the
second
paragraph
at
the
footnote
on
that
page,
in
the
case
of
jay
against
boyd
construing
8
u.s.c.
1254,
a
statute
which
says
that
the
attorney
general
“may
in
his
discretion”
suspend
the
part
--
deportation
of
any
alien.
that
language
seems
to
me
to
imply
even
more
than
the
language
in
the
statute
we’re
examining.
that
it
is
a
personal
decision
of
the
attorney
general
and
that
--
yet
this
court
has
held
that
that
statutory
power
maybe
delegated
and
in
kleindienst
against
mandel
which
is
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
that
footnote,
the
attorney
general
was
given
discretion
which
was
in
fact
in
that
case
exercised
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
he
delegated
it.
so
that
mr.
mitchell
and
mr.
lindenbaum
were
operating
against
the
background
of
statutes
was
a
general
delegation
statute
and
specific
other
statutes
giving
the
attorney
general
the
power
or
the
duty
to
do
things
which
had
been
delegated
in
which
delegations
have
been
upheld
in
the
past.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
think
to
this
extent.
i
think
there’s
a
limitation
obviously
but
i
think
the
limitation
is
best
read
as
to
the
office,
the
immediate
control
of
one
of
these
two
officials.
and
i
say
that
because
we
have
two
examples
in
our
brief
on
page
57
and
page
58
in
which
this
same
congress
had
provided
a
couple
of
months
before
that
something
must
be
done
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
deputy
attorney
general
which
parallels
the
language
we’re
talking
about
and
then
congress
went
on
and
said,
“which
function
may
not
be
delegated?”
now,
when
you
compare
that
with
the
language
here,
i
think
mr.
mitchell
and
mr.
lindenbaum
had
a
right
to
say,
here
as
an
attorney
general
and
a
deputy
attorney
general,
just
is
in
the
statute,
attorney
general
and
assistant
attorney
general.
in
the
civil
rights
act
they
say
it
may
not
be
delegated,
in
this
statute
they
don’t
say
it
which
i
think
gave
them
a
right
to
think
that
some
delegation
within
the
office
was
possible.
again,
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetics
act
which
we
discussed
on
page
50
has
the
same
kind
of
language
about
the
secretary
health,
education
and
welfare.
there
--
and
i
should
say
one
more
thing,
if
you
look,
if
one
looks
at
the
2516
(2),
we
see
that
congress
clearly
allows
hundreds
of
state
prosecutors
to
authorize
these
applications
and
in
fact,
in
the
legislative
history
which
we
quote
in
the
brief,
it
says
the
question
of
whether
the
state
officer
may
delegate,
state
attorney
general
may
delegate
will
be
controlled
by
the
law
of
delegation
of
the
state.
now,
that
takes
the
heart
out
of
this
argument
that
congress
was
so
concerned
that
the
attorney
general
himself
had
to
involve
himself
from
the
minutiae
of
every
application
for
a
wire
interception
order.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
was
a
draft
of
that
sort.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
that’s
correct
and
i
think
he
suggested
that
and
i
think
when
one
looks
at
that
against
the
law
of
delegation
and
the
su
--
and
the
law
of
no
delegation
which
congress
had
worked
out,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
they’re
talking
about
the
attorney
general
and
his
immediate
office
and
any
assistant
attorney
general
in
his
immediate
office
and
i
think
the
state
cases
indicate
the
same
policy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
very
curious
result
in
the
state
in
that
way
because
what
that
would
mean
is
that
congress
was
really
not
terribly
concerned
about
unitary
policies
of
any
kind.
they
were
more
suspicious
of
the
department
of
justice
of
the
federal
government
than
they
were
in
the
proliferation
of
state
and
local
and
county
governments
across
the
nation.
i
think
the
purpose
congress
had
was
in
unifying
policy,
they
did
not
mind
delegations
so
long
as
the
policy
was
unified
and
you
could
identify
the
man
who
was
responsible
even
though
it
delegated
it.
i
think
it’s
true
in
the
state
government,
i
think
that’s
true
in
the
federal
government
under
standard
delegation
law
that
we’ve
just
discussed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
when
i
said
delegation
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
i
meant
was
this
statutes
says
to
the
attorney
general,
unless
you
designate
an
assistant
attorney
general,
you
are
the
man
to
be
held
responsible
and
we
want
uniformity
of
policy
and
that
is
accomplished
when
he
takes
a
man
as
executive
assistant
whom
--
who
has
done
50
or
60
of
these
applications
and
says
now
you
know
my
policy,
when
i’m
unavailable,
act,
tell
me
when
i
get
back.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
consistent
with
what
we
mean
by,
it
limits
the
scope
of
delegation,
it
keeps
the
thing
within
a
narrow
campus.
it
seems
to
me,
given
the
state,
the
way
congress
treated
the
states,
it’s
the
much
more
realistic
reading
of
the
congressional
policy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it
might
have
been
better
mr.
justice
marshall
the
way
he
did
do
it
because
the
attorney
general
did
not
want
to
designate
any
assistant
attorney
general
to
exercise
this
operative
--
to
make
the
operative
decision.
he
thought
he
had
in
mr.
lindenbaum
and
in
fact,
he
did
have
in
mr.
lindenbaum,
a
man
who
would
follow
his
policies
exactly,
and
act
only
when
he
was
unavailable.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[attempt
to
laughter]
well,
it
varies
from
time
to
time
mr.
justice
marshall.
deputy
attorney
generals?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
run
around,
you
mean
are
there
irresponsible
assistant
attorney
generals?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
not
in
day-to-day
contact.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
do
indeed
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
wilson?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
apparently,
mr.
wilson
had
very
--
one
might
say
minimal
involvement
in
any
of
these
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
his
deputies
were
mr.
peterson,
mr.
shapiro
were
greatly
involved
as
the
memorandum
were
going
up,
they
approved
them.
but
the
operative
decision
was
mr.
mitchell’s
except
in
those
cases
where
he
was
unavailable
and
then
it
was
mr.
lindenbaum
carrying
out
mr.
mitchell’s
policies
and
i
think
mr.
mitchell
thought
that
that
was
greater
control
over
the
decision
than
it
would
have
been
had
he
designated
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
the
executive
assistant
acts
in
many
ways
for
the
attorney
general
on
routine
matters
when
he
understands
the
attorney
general’s
policy
in
many
cases
which
is
another
reason,
pardon
me,
which
is
another
reason
why
they
thought
this
was
perfectly
acceptable.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
within
the
organized
crime
section
of
the
criminal
division.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
didn’t
have
any
autonomy
in
that
sense.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
not
autonomy
mr.
chief
justice,
they
were
specialized
and
it
was
their
specialized
function
to
make
the
initial
review
of
these
matters
before
sending
it
up
the
hierarchy
through
the
criminal
division
but
they
had
no
autonomy.
thank
you.
