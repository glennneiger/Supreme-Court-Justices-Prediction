justice
byron
r.
white
i
must
confess
that
i
share
justice
stuart’s
confusion.
i
thought
that
the
salmon
issue
and
the
salmon
regulation
are
not
before
us
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
relevant
in
the
decision
of
this
case
or
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty
especially
as
applied
in
today
to
inquire
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
state
contributes
annually
to
the
steelhead
run?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not
resolve
but
is
it
relevant.
i
take
it
that
left
to
its
own
devises
the
steelhead
run
might
not
maintain
itself
at
the
present
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
native
steelhead
run
is
only
a
fraction
of
what
it
would
be
if
the
state
did
not
annually
feed
the
steelhead
in
the
puyallup?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
irrelevant
consideration
as
to
what
indian
--
what
in
common
with
others
ought
to
mean
in
a
treaty
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
of
accustomed
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
it
also
means
that
the
usual
and
custom
manner?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
pyallup
one
say
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
did
puyallup
say
anything
else
about
it
in
terms
of
how
the
means
to
likely
to
fish
even
if
they
have
the
right
to
fish
in
the
accustomed
places,
did
it
say
anything
about
whether
they
could
do
fishing
on
an
accustomed
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
treaty
would
give
the
--
treaty
fishing
right
do
you
think
would
cover
--
would
guarantee
the
right
for
indians
to
fish
commercially
even
though
at
the
time
the
treaty
was
assigned
that
they
have
never
fished
commercially?
they
have
simply
did
it
was
a
matter
of
subsistence.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
asking
whether
what
is
your
view
of
the
treaty?
would
the
treaty
guarantee
the
right
of
the
indians
to
fish
commercially
when
they
never
had
fished
commercially
to
time
the
treaty
itself
assigned?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
irrelevant
question
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
to
what
they
just
did
for
one
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that
they
set
up
indicated,
i
hope
to
standard,
they
have
set
up
for
future
years
would
be
based
on
what
is
necessary
of
conservation.
i
guess
it
is.
i
guess
it
would
be
if
you
said
that
they
had
the
supply
sports
fisherman?
justice
byron
r.
white
such
as
a
commercial
fishery?
justice
byron
r.
white
such
as
a
commercial
fishery?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
concede
--
you
do
not
attack
the
finding
that
if
you
take
into
consideration
a
number
of
fish
that
are
caught
in
the
sporting
business
that
to
allow
commercial
fishery
will
endanger
the
run.
as
long
as
you
accept
that
many
fishes
taken
by
the
sporting
industry,
then
the
supreme
court
is
quite
right
in
saying
that
commercial
fishery
can’t
be
allowed.
you
do
not
contest
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
the
court
found
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
fact
and
let
us
assume
you
accept
that.
now,
your
real
argument
is
that
this
sports
industry
should
not
be
able
to
take
that
many
fish,
if
it
means
cutting
the
indians
out
of
commercial
fishery?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
washington
could
if
we
agreed
with
you,
cease
putting
steelhead
in
the
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
suppose
mr.
sachse
that
what
would
be
--
what
is
obvious
necessary
to
conserve
conservation
or
to
conserve
the
runs
might
be
considerately
be
different
than
what's
necessary
when
the
fish
is
putting
in
61%
of
the
fish
that
are
caught?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
size
of
a
commercial
fishery
the
indians
are
talking
about
or
desire
to
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
ever
had
a
--
justice
byron

white
they
never
had
a
commercial
steelhead
fishery
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
has
never
been
a
commercial
steelhead
fisheries?
justice
byron

white
well,
in
the
hearing
of
the
--
in

to
find
that
the
indians
couldn’t
give
up
to
run
a
sport
fishery,
there
must
have
been
some
evidence
put
in
by
the
indians
as
to
what
kind
of
a
sport
fishery
--
justice
byron

--
commercial

they
were
talking
about?
justice
byron

what
did

even

justice

you
don’t
have
