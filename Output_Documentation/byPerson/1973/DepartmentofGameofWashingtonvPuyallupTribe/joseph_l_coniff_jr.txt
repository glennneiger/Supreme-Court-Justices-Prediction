mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
my
name
is
joseph
laurence
coniff
jr.
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general
from
the
state
of
washington
and
i
am
here
representing
the
washington
department
of
game.
as
i
am
sure,
the
court
is
aware,
this
is
the
second
time
that
this
particular
matter
has
been
before
the
court.
the
previous
occasion
was
of
course
in
1968
and
the
court
had
occasion
to
render
its
opinion
in
this
matter
in
391
u.s.
392.
this
case
basically
involves
a
further
clarification
of
the
treaty
language,
indian
treaty
language
pertaining
to
off
reserve
claim,
off
reservation
indian
fishing
rights
and
i
would
like
to
preliminary
note
to
the
court's
information
that
at
the
time
that
this
litigation
was
commenced
in
1963,
at
both
the
washington
department
of
game
and
washington
department
of
fisheries
were
party’s
plaintiff
and
adopted
the
same
position.
however,
i
have
been
instructed
to
advise
the
court
that
the
washington
department
of
fisheries
has
not
sought
review
of
the
lower
court
opinion,
which
is
now
before
you,
but
that
the
washington
in
department
of
game
has
authorized
and
instructed
me
to
file
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
of
course
the
court
has
granted.
i
should
also
advise
you
that
the
washington
department
of
fisheries
position
as
contrasted
to
the
washington
department
of
games
position
has
predicated
upon
its
reading
of
this
court’s
prior
opinion.
the
fishery's
position
appears
to
be
predicated
upon
the
concept
of
granting
to
indian,
treaty
indians,
special
indian
only
commercial
netting
seasons
for
salmon
in
the
fresh
water
streams
of
the
state
of
washington.
it
is
the
position
of
the
washington
department
of
game
before
this
court
that
the
position
of
our
sister
agency
is
incorrect
and
is
unlawful.
because
a
state
law
prohibits
the
use
of
this
type
of
set
net
or
commercial
netting
gear
on
the
catching
of
anadromous
fish
of
which
both
salmon
and
steelhead
are
anadromous
fish
in
off
reservation
waters.
and
in
reality,
the
position
which
has
been
adapted
by
the
fisheries
department
and
which
is
closely
parallel
by
the
federal
government’s
position
in
this
case
before
the
court
is
predicated
upon
the
assumption
that
the
state
administrative
agency
director
has
the
authority
by
regulation
to
issue
a
regulation
authorizing
activity,
which
the
state
legislature
has
prohibited.
and
it
is
game’s
position
that
a
fair
reading
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
puyallup
wan
and
in
particularly
the
language
utilized
by
justice
douglas
who
wrote
for
unanimous
court.
and
the
concluding
paragraph
of
that
opinion
which
emphasizes
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
the
treaty
fishing
clause
language.
that
language
is
that
the
right
to
fish
in
off
reservation
waters,
at
usual
and
accustomed
places
outside
reservation
boundaries
is
one
which
might
be
exercised
in
common
with
all
of
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
and
justice
douglas
speaking
for
the
court,
emphasized
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
that
language,
and
it
is
game’s
position
before
this
court
that
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
the
treaty
language
itself
require
a
reversal
of
the
lower
court.
in
other
words
gentlemen,
the
line
of
demarcation
should
be
the
reservation
boundaries
and
that
once
that
an
indian,
reservation
indian
moves
outside
of
the
reservation
boundaries
into
off
reservation
areas
that
he
is
fully
subject
and
amenable
to
the
jurisdiction
and
enforcement
if
you
will
of
state
conversation
laws,
rules
and
regulations,
pertaining
to
the
taking
of
fish.
and
this
would
include
salmon
as
well
as
steelhead.
i
believe
that
our
position,
i
mean
game’s
position
is
further
sustained
by
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
mescalero
apache
decision
versus
franklin
jones
which
is
41
law
week
4451.
this
decision
i
feel
is
of
very
critical
importance
to
the
legal
position
which
has
been
taken
by
the
department
of
game,
before
the
court,
and
that
deals
with
off
reservation
activities
on
part
of
the
indian
tribe
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
and
the
facts
of
the
case
are,
that
the
mescalero
tribe
pursuant
to
a
federal
program
constructed
a
ski
enterprise
in
an
off
reservation
location.
and
the
argument
was
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
could
not
impose
its
taxing
laws
to
this
particular
enterprise
and
this
court
citing
interestingly
enough
the
puyallup
decision
held
that
the
absent
federal
law
to
the
contrary,
indians
going
beyond
reservation
boundaries
have
been
generally
held
subject
to
non-discriminatory
state
law.
otherwise
applicable
to
all
citizens
of
the
state,
see
puyallup
tribe
versus
the
department
of
game
and
a
series
of
other
cases,
and
i
think
the
following
languages
in
that
paragraph
is
sufficiently
important
to
call
it
and
emphasize
it
to
the
court’s
attention.
in
discussing
racehorse,
it
states
that
principle,
the
racehorse
principle
is
as
relevant
to
a
states
tax
law
as
it
is
to
state
criminal
laws.
see
the
case
and
applies
as
much
to
tribal
ski
resorts
as
it
does
to
fishing
enterprises
citing
village
of
kate
v.
igen
(ph).
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
believe
ward
v.
racehorse
is
the
kind
of
general
language
that
you
are
referring
too.
that
the
facts
of
ward
v.
racehorse
involved
a
treaty
with
comparable
language,
involving
i
believe
it
was
the
vanic
tribe
in
the
state
of
utah
and
this
is
of
course
an
older
decision
of
the
court,
but
i
believe
that
it
has
been
revitalized.
and
that
particular
case
happen
to
involve
hunting
instead
of
fishing,
but
i
think
that
the
same
type
of
language
was
involved.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
well
that
my
point
is
your
honor
the
treaty
involved
in
ward
v.
racehorse
is
so
close
to
the
isaac
i.
stevens
treaties
that
were
confronted
with
in
the
state
of
washington
that
the
court’s
revitalization,
if
you
will
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine
of
ward
v.
racehorse,
i
believe
to
be
extremely
significant.
and
that
is
why
i
was
pointing
out
this
court’s
reliance,
and
i
believe
that
revitalization
of
the
ward
v.
racehorse
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
it
was
not
treated
in
puyallup
1
except,
as
i
understand
the
final
paragraphs
of
that
opinion
as
authored
by
justice
douglas
which
indicated
that
the
final
resolution
of
the
problem,
which
the
court
did
not
reach
in
that
opinion,
should
include
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
the
treaty
language
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
now,
i
would
submit
that
the
question
certainly
is
not
foreclosed
at
this
time,
particularly
in
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
the
mescalero
case
and
the
citation
of
ward,
and
i
believe
i
am
certainly
not
--
i
am
sure
when
i
say
equal
footing,
we
all
know
what
i
am
talking
about.
so,
i
am
not
going
to
go
back
and
try
to
run
that
one
through
again
unless
you
want
me
to.
but,
i
think
it
is
extremely
important
and
i
think
it
is
important
when
we
keep
in
mind
that
in
1854
and
55,
the
indians
who
were
residents
in
washington
territory
with
whom
governor
stevens
was
ordered
to
treat
were
not
citizens,
and
i
think
that
the
civil
war,
obviously
has
not
been
fought,
the
fourteenth
amendment
lay
in
the
unforeseeable
future.
it
of
course
was
not
adapted
until
1868.
and
so
when
we
look
at
the
actual
positions
of
the
parties,
the
american
commissioner
is
on
the
one
side
and
the
indian
people
on
the
other.
the
indians
were
being
asked
to
move
to
a
place
where
they
would
have
exclusive
rights.
they
do
have
exclusive
rights
within
their
reservation
boundaries
and
so
far
as
the
taking
of
fishing
game
is
concerned.
this
is
conceded
and
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
this
has
always
been
the
position
that
my
clients
have
taken.
we
have
no
jurisdiction
and
no
authority
to
go
into
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation
and
enforce
any
state
conversation
laws,
rules
or
regulations.
and
we
do
not
do
so.
so
when
we
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
in
some
instances,
there
are.
in
some
instances,
there
aren’t.
the
larger
tribes
act
for
example
the
yakima,
that
makah,
quinault,
some
of
these
larger
groups
not
only
have
printed
regulations
but
they
actually
have
an
enforcement
where
they
have
tribal
courts,
with
policemen.
i
happen
to
know
the
yakima
tribe
also
has
a
jail
and
i
do
understand
that
they
do
arrest
people
for
infractions
that
they
enforce.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
cannot
answer
you
on
my
own
personal
knowledge.
i
believe
that
it
is
true
in
some
instances,
generally
with
some
of
the
larger
tribes.
but
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
over
40
some
odd
tribes
listed
in
the
preambles
to
the
governor,
the
five
governor
isaac
i.
stevens
treaties.
and
that
some
of
these
tribes
were
in
reality
small
villages
in
1855,
and
so
some
of
the
memberships
and
some
of
the
groups
that
are
claiming
these
rights
within
the
state
of
washington
at
this
time
are
very
small
rather,
if
you
will,
fragmented
organizations
without
any
real
cohesive,
political
or
governmental
authority.
so,
when
we
say
the
word
indians,
you
still
have
to
take
it
a
step
further
in
terms
of
your
analysis
it’s
apples
and
oranges
when
you
get
down
to
the
reality
on
the
riverbank.
i
do
wanted
to
--
i
did
want
to
make
a
point
very
clear
however
for
the
record
that
we
are
not
here
discussing
any
attempted
entrenchment
if
you
will,
of
any
self
government
or
any
on
reservation
activity
on
the
part
of
any
indian
tribe
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
it
is.
i
believe
that
the
taking,
that
the
use
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
if
i
was
here
talking
about
is
the
extinction
of
the
fish,
then
i
would
agree
with
you.
but
to
me,
the
term
conversation,
i
know
it’s
something
more
than
simply
seeing
the
last
two.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well
yes
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
all
right,
i
think
i
might
refer
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
might
refer
the
court
to
the
appendix
in
number
247
october
term
1967.
this
is
the
complaint
at
page
six,
this
was
the
complaint
that
i
drafted
when
i
was
at
a
law
school
about
one
year
and
here
i
am.
but
i
wanted
to
point
out
what
the
complaint
was
asking
the
courts
to
do
and
i
do
not
think
we
have
reached
it.
i
do
not
think
we
have
reached
the
answer
yet.
paragraph
five
reads,
the
defendants
claim
special
privileges
are
immunities
from
the
application
of
valid
conservation
laws
of
the
state
of
washington
to
which
they
are
not
legally
entitled.
by
virtue
of
the
claims
special
privileges
or
immunities,
the
defendants
are
fishing
extensively
in
the
puyallup
river
and
commencement
bay
with
set
nets
and
drift
nets.
paragraph
six,
as
a
result
of
the
defendants
fishery,
the
anadromous
fish
runs
and
the
puyallup
river
will
be
virtually
extinguished,
exterminated
if
said
fishery
is
permitted
to
continue
and
no
adequate
and
speedy
remedy
and
so
forth
in
the
prairie.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
you
would
be
trading
the
resource
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
would
not
be
my
client’s
position
and
that
is
not,
i
do
not
believe
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
is
not
a
fair
reading
of
the
treaty
provision
and
it
is
not
a
fair
reading
of
the
decision
who
want
that
might
be
applicable
or
might
apply.
i
would
also
add
in
response
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
with
all
other
citizens
whether
it
be
sport
or
commercial,
i
would
like
to
point
out
there
is
no
discrimination
against
indians
to
go
outside
their
reservation
and
engage
in
either
sport
fishing
activities
or
commercial
fishing
activities
pursuant
to
state
regulations.
so
that
there
is
not
this
discrimination
and
really,
the
point,
the
reason
why
i
went
back
and
read
the
book
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
is
it,
it
is
a
quantification
question,
a
question
of
interpreting
the
language
and
attempting
to
quantify
it
and
i
am
submitting
to
the
court
that
if
fair
reading,
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
treaty
language
in
question
would
necessarily
imply
in
light
of
the
historical
circumstances
under
which
it
was
executed
that
indians
were
entitled
or
given
a
right
in
1854
-
55
not
to
be
discriminated
against,
keeping
in
mind
the
date,
the
historical
setting
in
which
these
treaties
were
executed,
that
fourteenth
amendment
was
in
the
future
and
if
pioneers
and
settlers
pursuant
to
government
policy
were
being
encouraged
to
move
out,
move
into
this
territory
and
let
us
settle
it,
let
us
take
it
over.
we
just
settle
things
with
the
nation
of
great
britain
and
we
wanted
to
the
hudson
bay
company
was
moving
out
and
we
wanted
to
populate
this
area.
the
government
obviously
had
a
problem.
they
had
to
go
out
and
treat
with
the
native
populations
and
part
of
the
deal
was
to
give
them
exclusive
rights.
to
give
them
a
place
to
reside
and
hopefully
to
be
integrated
into
society
in
sometime,
but
the
reservations,
--
the
subject
to
and
when
i
believe,
the
reservations
were
intended
to
be
temporary.
they
have
not
turned
out
to
be
that
way.
i
am
not
quarreling
with
that.
i
believe
that
is
the
law
today,
but
certainly
when
you
compare
the
exclusive
rights
to
fish
and
hunt
within
the
reservation
which
clearly
was
understood
i
believe
by
everyone
at
that
time,
i
think
you
keep
that
fact
in
mind
when
you
look
at
the
quantum
any
if
you
will
of
the
off
reservation
in
common
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
yes,
i
am
trying
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
in
my
view,
the
question
of
treaty
interpretation
does
not
depend
upon
the
species
of
fish.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
agree.
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
otherwise,
you
are
going
to
have
a
bifurcated
analysis,
a
bifurcated
law
if
you
will.
depending
upon
the
way
the
state
legislature
decides
to
classify
a
fish.
the
treaty
says
the
right
to
fish
at
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
in
common.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
do
not
agree
with
that
because
i
recognize
the
government
is
urging
upon
the
court
that
this
is
foreclosed.
i
am
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
the
treaty
does
not
say
salmon.
the
treaty
does
not
say
steelhead.
the
treaty
does
not
say
trout
or
bass
or
any
other
species.
it
says
the
right
to
fish
and
i
honestly
believed
that
the
impact
of
this
court’s
decision
would
be
to
establish
a
common
rule,
which
would
apply
to
all
species
of
fish,
which
might
be
subject
to
commercial
netting
activities
in
off
reservation
waters
of
the
state.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well?
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
is
not
my
real
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
perhaps,
i
did
not
express
myself
well
enough
in
my
statement
of
the
issues
in
the
brief
or
in
the
petition.
but
at
page
10,
the
first
issue
stated
in
my
brief
is
whether
the
equal
protection
concepts
in
the
treaty
phrase
is
common
with
all
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
it
means
that
treaty
indians
must
abide
by
state
conservation
laws
and
regulations
when
they
engage
in
fishing
in
off
reservation
waters
and
clearly
the
treaty
itself,
which
is
the
fundamental
predicate
from
which
we
are
going
to
legally
operate
does
not
make
this
distinction.
and
i
believe
that
the
actual
impact
of
any
decision
of
this
court
will
not
be
limited
to
given
specie
of
fish.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
it
would
be
as
appendix
a
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
file
on
september
20th
,
1972.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
and
it
is
in
appendix
which
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
now,
i
might
add
in
another
point
here
to
this
question
of
treaty
interpretation
which
i
feel
is
quite
humane
and
frankly,
i
feel
is
important
as
an
interpretive
aid
to
the
court
in
interpreting
the
content
or
quantification.
if
you
will
or
meaning
to
be
common
with
language
as
it
might
pertain
to
off
reservation
fishing
and
hunting
is
the
rather
interesting
fact
that
the
in
common
with
language
does
appear
in
another
context.
in
a
governor
steven’s
treaty
and
that
is
the
treaty
with
the
yakima.
now
the
treaty
with
the
yakima
provides
in
addition
to
the
usual
off
reservation,
usual
language
on
the
right
in
common
to
fish
at
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
station,
and
it
also
provides
the
following,
as
is
also
the
right
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
travel
upon
all
the
public
highways.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
rather
unusual
result
to
obtain
if
this
application
of
state
police
power
is
in
a
form
of
traffic
rules
and
regulations
on
public
highways.
if
there
is
a
constitutional
impediment
to
the
application
of
the
state
laws
in
that
regard
in
the
terms
of
the
fishing,
the
context
of
fishing
but
we
could
really
reach
the
very
strange
result
if
we
attempted
to
apply
that
rationale
to
this
language,
which
appears
in
the
treaty
with
the
yakima.
and
i
frankly
do
not
know
what
the
answer
would
be
to
the
problem
that
i
supposed,
but
i
am
relying
upon
the
language
in
the
yakima
treaty
at
least
as
an
interpretive
aid.
in
other
words,
where
the
same
languages
as
used
by
the
same
author,
in
this
case,
governor
isaac
i.
stevens.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
did
not
believe
that
that
is
--
in
my
judgment,
i
did
not
believe
that
that
would
resolve
the
question
for
you
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
studies
that
the
department
has
undertaken
regarding
the
extent
of
hatchery
contributions
to
sport
catch
reach
somewhat
varying
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
in
that
sense
it
maybe.
i
still
maintain
before
the
court
that
what
should
be
relevant
but
what
were
the
relative
circumstances
of
the
parties
read
the
entire
instrument
as
a
whole.
keeping
in
mind
the
exclusive
nature
of
the
rights,
which
were
to
be
granted
and
confirmed
to
the
indian
tribes
in
terms
of
their
on
reservation
fishing,
and
hunting
activities,
and
the
contrast
in
that
with
the
off
reservation
in
common
with
language,
keeping
in
mind
the
fact
that
indians
were
not
citizens
at
that
time,
and
keeping
in
mind
that
this
language
does
appear
in
another
context
in
that
article
iii
of
the
treaty
with
the
yakima
and
that
should
the
court
reach
a
result
in
interpreting
in
common
with
to
mean
exclusive
paramount
or
prior
in
some
sense.
so
that
they
have
a
right
to
catch
these
fish
perhaps
superior
to
all
other
citizens
that
they
may
be
able
to
catch
all
the
fish
and
the
citizens
not
any.
then
suppose
at
that
point,
your
honor
that
then
these
considerations
that
you
have
mentioned
of
the
extent
of
the
contribution
to
the
resource
by
public
funds
would
become
relevant
and
important.
but
unless,
i
believe
that
you
have
to
first
answer
or
reach
the
question
of
some
sort
of
quantification
and
it
is
only
at
that
point
that
you
would
then
begin
to
judicially
inquire
into
well,
--
perhaps
the
native
runs
would
not
be
as
high
with
absent
the
contribution
of
the
state.
and
i
might
add
that
the
federal
government
for
that
matter
to
the
resource
in
form
of
fish
passage
facilities
at
dams,
stream
plants,
projects,
hatchery
programs.
i
just
mentioned
the
washington
department
of
game,
our
lowest
study
shows
that
on
the
puyallup
with
the
lowest
contribution
in
a
single
year,
i
believe
was
60%
running
as
high
as
80%
of
total
catch
developed
from
our
hatching
program,
which
for
the
most
part
is
financed
by
the
sale.
approximately
80%
financed
by
the
sale
of
fishing
licenses
of
steelhead
punch
cards.
so,
the
sportsman
himself
are
--
you
might
say
paying
for
a
large
part
of
the
resource,
but
i
still
maintain
that
we
do
not
reach
this
question
unless
we
first
have
reached
the
fundamental
question
of
what
is
it
that
was
secured.
it
is
my
primary
argument
to
you
to
that
level
rather
than
to
the
level
that
you
have
suggested.
although
in
my
brief,
i
will
admit
i
do
take
an
alternative
position.
there
is
a
recent
opinion
post
to
puyallup
and
post
to
mescalero
a
copy
of
which
i
passed
to
be
you
at
large
with
clerk
of
the
court
entitled
settler
v.
yakima
tribal
council,
or
excuse
me,
yakima
tribe
court
was
issued
by
the
federal
district
court
for
the
federal
district
--
the
eastern
district
of
washington
by
the
honorable
george
h.
powell
on
september
26,
1973.
this
is
the
only
decision
that
i
am
aware
of
on
a
federal
level,
which
deals
with
puyallup
and
mescalero
and
the
issue
before
the
court,
it
is
not
obviously
in
my
brief.
as
i
mentioned
the
copiously
lies.
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
or
not
the
yakimas
passed
a
regulation
pertaining
to
off
reservation
fishing
by
yakima
indians
on
the
columbia
river,
and
then
went
down
on
the
river
and
arrested
a
couple
of
members
of
the
tribe
who
were
violating
those
regulations
for
about
60
miles
off
the
reservation,got
them
back
and
try
to
convict
them.
the
issue
then
was
whether
or
not
they
had
jurisdiction.
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
washington
relying
on
the
puyallup-mescalero
rationale
held
that
the
yakimas
do
not
have
extra
territorial
jurisdiction.
i
know
that
white
light
is
on
and
i
would
like
to
if
i
may
reserve
the
two
or
three
moments
remaining
to
me
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor,
(inaudible)
mr.
chief
justice.
first
point
i’d
like
to
make
is
that
steelhead
as
a
game
fish
may
only
be
taken
with
broken
line
in
waters
in
the
state
of
washington.
there
is
no
salt
water
or
marine
commercial
fishery
for
the
species
and
no
sport
fishery
to
any
substantial
extent
at
all
occurs
in
salt
water.
therefore,
the
only
place
where
steelhead
maybe
taken
under
state
law
is
by
hook
and
line
in
fresh
water
streams
at
the
very
same
locations
that
this
indians
are
claiming
rights
to
put
commercial
fish.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
no,
i
am
merely
advising
the
court
that
that
is
a
fact.
that
is
where
the
fishery
occurs,
that
is
the
sport
fishing
occurs.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
okay,
in
the
past
up
until
now,
that’s
where
it
has
occurred.
there
is
no
commercial
marine
fishery.
these
are
not
commercial
fish.
there
is
no
commercial
market
for
steelhead
in
the
state
of
washington.
they
are
a
game
fish
and
i
wanted
to
make
that
point.
second
point
is
i
wanted
to
just
simply
briefly
re
emphasize
mescalero-ward
versus
racehorse
as
a
part
of
the
reading
of
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
the
treaty
language.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct
and
i
agree
with
the
statements
made
by
counsel
the
way
the
issues
are
delineated
before
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
--
they
are
okay.
the
basic
way
that
they
where
wrong
is
that
they
are
allowing
the
director
of
the
department
of
fisheries
to
set
special
indian
only
seasons
for
commercial
harvest
of
fish
in
off
reservation
waters
contrary
to
the
treaty
language.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
understand
you.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
the
department
of
fisheries
has
not
the
department
of
game.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
they
have
in
a
number
of
fishes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
not
the
steelheads.
steelheads
are
under
game
jurisdiction,
the
salmon
are
under
the
fisheries
jurisdiction
bound
under
state
law.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
with
respect
to
steelhead
it
had
imposed
an
additional
burden
upon
the
washington
department
of
game
in
that,
it
has
to
demonstrate
annually
that
it
is
quote
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
under
all
series
of
court
challenges
and
that
leads
me
to
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
leave
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
under
the
language
of
opinion
that
it
indicates
that
the
sport
fishery,
being
a
very
efficient
fishery,
broken
line
is
opposed
to
a
net
would
be
satisfying.
and
then
if
it
can
be
demonstrated,
there
is
a
surplus
at
that
point;
it
is
then
incumbent
under
the
state
of
the
law,
under
the
opinion
below
to
establish
this
special
commercial
season
on
game
fish
of
steelhead
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
discrimination
under
state
law
in
off
reservation
areas.
there
is
and
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
civil
unrest
in
the
state,
a
great
deal
of
confrontations,
riverbank,
shoot
outs
if
you
will.
our
game
department
headquarters
have
even
been
taken
over.
offices
are
ransacked
and
so
forth
and
i
really
point
out
that
in
light
of
these
facts
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
are
a
number
of
pending
cases
including
us
versus
washington
that
there
is
a
definite
need
for
clarification
beyond
that
given
us
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
my
name
is
joseph
laurence
coniff
jr.
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general
from
the
state
of
washington
and
i
am
here
representing
the
washington
department
of
game.
as
i
am
sure,
the
court
is
aware,
this
is
the
second
time
that
this
particular
matter
has
been
before
the
court.
the
previous
occasion
was
of
course
in
1968
and
the
court
had
occasion
to
render
its
opinion
in
this
matter
in
391
u.s.
392.
this
case
basically
involves
a
further
clarification
of
the
treaty
language,
indian
treaty
language
pertaining
to
off
reserve
claim,
off
reservation
indian
fishing
rights
and
i
would
like
to
preliminary
note
to
the
court's
information
that
at
the
time
that
this
litigation
was
commenced
in
1963,
at
both
the
washington
department
of
game
and
washington
department
of
fisheries
were
party’s
plaintiff
and
adopted
the
same
position.
however,
i
have
been
instructed
to
advise
the
court
that
the
washington
department
of
fisheries
has
not
sought
review
of
the
lower
court
opinion,
which
is
now
before
you,
but
that
the
washington
in
department
of
game
has
authorized
and
instructed
me
to
file
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
of
course
the
court
has
granted.
i
should
also
advise
you
that
the
washington
department
of
fisheries
position
as
contrasted
to
the
washington
department
of
games
position
has
predicated
upon
its
reading
of
this
court’s
prior
opinion.
the
fishery's
position
appears
to
be
predicated
upon
the
concept
of
granting
to
indian,
treaty
indians,
special
indian
only
commercial
netting
seasons
for
salmon
in
the
fresh
water
streams
of
the
state
of
washington.
it
is
the
position
of
the
washington
department
of
game
before
this
court
that
the
position
of
our
sister
agency
is
incorrect
and
is
unlawful.
because
a
state
law
prohibits
the
use
of
this
type
of
set
net
or
commercial
netting
gear
on
the
catching
of
anadromous
fish
of
which
both
salmon
and
steelhead
are
anadromous
fish
in
off
reservation
waters.
and
in
reality,
the
position
which
has
been
adapted
by
the
fisheries
department
and
which
is
closely
parallel
by
the
federal
government’s
position
in
this
case
before
the
court
is
predicated
upon
the
assumption
that
the
state
administrative
agency
director
has
the
authority
by
regulation
to
issue
a
regulation
authorizing
activity,
which
the
state
legislature
has
prohibited.
and
it
is
game’s
position
that
a
fair
reading
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
puyallup
wan
and
in
particularly
the
language
utilized
by
justice
douglas
who
wrote
for
unanimous
court.
and
the
concluding
paragraph
of
that
opinion
which
emphasizes
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
the
treaty
fishing
clause
language.
that
language
is
that
the
right
to
fish
in
off
reservation
waters,
at
usual
and
accustomed
places
outside
reservation
boundaries
is
one
which
might
be
exercised
in
common
with
all
of
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
and
justice
douglas
speaking
for
the
court,
emphasized
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
that
language,
and
it
is
game’s
position
before
this
court
that
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
the
treaty
language
itself
require
a
reversal
of
the
lower
court.
in
other
words
gentlemen,
the
line
of
demarcation
should
be
the
reservation
boundaries
and
that
once
that
an
indian,
reservation
indian
moves
outside
of
the
reservation
boundaries
into
off
reservation
areas
that
he
is
fully
subject
and
amenable
to
the
jurisdiction
and
enforcement
if
you
will
of
state
conversation
laws,
rules
and
regulations,
pertaining
to
the
taking
of
fish.
and
this
would
include
salmon
as
well
as
steelhead.
i
believe
that
our
position,
i
mean
game’s
position
is
further
sustained
by
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
mescalero
apache
decision
versus
franklin
jones
which
is
41
law
week
4451.
this
decision
i
feel
is
of
very
critical
importance
to
the
legal
position
which
has
been
taken
by
the
department
of
game,
before
the
court,
and
that
deals
with
off
reservation
activities
on
part
of
the
indian
tribe
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
and
the
facts
of
the
case
are,
that
the
mescalero
tribe
pursuant
to
a
federal
program
constructed
a
ski
enterprise
in
an
off
reservation
location.
and
the
argument
was
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
could
not
impose
its
taxing
laws
to
this
particular
enterprise
and
this
court
citing
interestingly
enough
the
puyallup
decision
held
that
the
absent
federal
law
to
the
contrary,
indians
going
beyond
reservation
boundaries
have
been
generally
held
subject
to
non-discriminatory
state
law.
otherwise
applicable
to
all
citizens
of
the
state,
see
puyallup
tribe
versus
the
department
of
game
and
a
series
of
other
cases,
and
i
think
the
following
languages
in
that
paragraph
is
sufficiently
important
to
call
it
and
emphasize
it
to
the
court’s
attention.
in
discussing
racehorse,
it
states
that
principle,
the
racehorse
principle
is
as
relevant
to
a
states
tax
law
as
it
is
to
state
criminal
laws.
see
the
case
and
applies
as
much
to
tribal
ski
resorts
as
it
does
to
fishing
enterprises
citing
village
of
kate
v.
igen
(ph).
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
believe
ward
v.
racehorse
is
the
kind
of
general
language
that
you
are
referring
too.
that
the
facts
of
ward
v.
racehorse
involved
a
treaty
with
comparable
language,
involving
i
believe
it
was
the
vanic
tribe
in
the
state
of
utah
and
this
is
of
course
an
older
decision
of
the
court,
but
i
believe
that
it
has
been
revitalized.
and
that
particular
case
happen
to
involve
hunting
instead
of
fishing,
but
i
think
that
the
same
type
of
language
was
involved.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
well
that
my
point
is
your
honor
the
treaty
involved
in
ward
v.
racehorse
is
so
close
to
the
isaac
i.
stevens
treaties
that
were
confronted
with
in
the
state
of
washington
that
the
court’s
revitalization,
if
you
will
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine
of
ward
v.
racehorse,
i
believe
to
be
extremely
significant.
and
that
is
why
i
was
pointing
out
this
court’s
reliance,
and
i
believe
that
revitalization
of
the
ward
v.
racehorse
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
it
was
not
treated
in
puyallup
1
except,
as
i
understand
the
final
paragraphs
of
that
opinion
as
authored
by
justice
douglas
which
indicated
that
the
final
resolution
of
the
problem,
which
the
court
did
not
reach
in
that
opinion,
should
include
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
the
treaty
language
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
now,
i
would
submit
that
the
question
certainly
is
not
foreclosed
at
this
time,
particularly
in
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
the
mescalero
case
and
the
citation
of
ward,
and
i
believe
i
am
certainly
not
--
i
am
sure
when
i
say
equal
footing,
we
all
know
what
i
am
talking
about.
so,
i
am
not
going
to
go
back
and
try
to
run
that
one
through
again
unless
you
want
me
to.
but,
i
think
it
is
extremely
important
and
i
think
it
is
important
when
we
keep
in
mind
that
in
1854
and
55,
the
indians
who
were
residents
in
washington
territory
with
whom
governor
stevens
was
ordered
to
treat
were
not
citizens,
and
i
think
that
the
civil
war,
obviously
has
not
been
fought,
the
fourteenth
amendment
lay
in
the
unforeseeable
future.
it
of
course
was
not
adapted
until
1868.
and
so
when
we
look
at
the
actual
positions
of
the
parties,
the
american
commissioner
is
on
the
one
side
and
the
indian
people
on
the
other.
the
indians
were
being
asked
to
move
to
a
place
where
they
would
have
exclusive
rights.
they
do
have
exclusive
rights
within
their
reservation
boundaries
and
so
far
as
the
taking
of
fishing
game
is
concerned.
this
is
conceded
and
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
this
has
always
been
the
position
that
my
clients
have
taken.
we
have
no
jurisdiction
and
no
authority
to
go
into
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation
and
enforce
any
state
conversation
laws,
rules
or
regulations.
and
we
do
not
do
so.
so
when
we
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
in
some
instances,
there
are.
in
some
instances,
there
aren’t.
the
larger
tribes
act
for
example
the
yakima,
that
makah,
quinault,
some
of
these
larger
groups
not
only
have
printed
regulations
but
they
actually
have
an
enforcement
where
they
have
tribal
courts,
with
policemen.
i
happen
to
know
the
yakima
tribe
also
has
a
jail
and
i
do
understand
that
they
do
arrest
people
for
infractions
that
they
enforce.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
cannot
answer
you
on
my
own
personal
knowledge.
i
believe
that
it
is
true
in
some
instances,
generally
with
some
of
the
larger
tribes.
but
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
over
40
some
odd
tribes
listed
in
the
preambles
to
the
governor,
the
five
governor
isaac
i.
stevens
treaties.
and
that
some
of
these
tribes
were
in
reality
small
villages
in
1855,
and
so
some
of
the
memberships
and
some
of
the
groups
that
are
claiming
these
rights
within
the
state
of
washington
at
this
time
are
very
small
rather,
if
you
will,
fragmented
organizations
without
any
real
cohesive,
political
or
governmental
authority.
so,
when
we
say
the
word
indians,
you
still
have
to
take
it
a
step
further
in
terms
of
your
analysis
it’s
apples
and
oranges
when
you
get
down
to
the
reality
on
the
riverbank.
i
do
wanted
to
--
i
did
want
to
make
a
point
very
clear
however
for
the
record
that
we
are
not
here
discussing
any
attempted
entrenchment
if
you
will,
of
any
self
government
or
any
on
reservation
activity
on
the
part
of
any
indian
tribe
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
it
is.
i
believe
that
the
taking,
that
the
use
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
if
i
was
here
talking
about
is
the
extinction
of
the
fish,
then
i
would
agree
with
you.
but
to
me,
the
term
conversation,
i
know
it’s
something
more
than
simply
seeing
the
last
two.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well
yes
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
all
right,
i
think
i
might
refer
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
might
refer
the
court
to
the
appendix
in
number
247
october
term
1967.
this
is
the
complaint
at
page
six,
this
was
the
complaint
that
i
drafted
when
i
was
at
a
law
school
about
one
year
and
here
i
am.
but
i
wanted
to
point
out
what
the
complaint
was
asking
the
courts
to
do
and
i
do
not
think
we
have
reached
it.
i
do
not
think
we
have
reached
the
answer
yet.
paragraph
five
reads,
the
defendants
claim
special
privileges
are
immunities
from
the
application
of
valid
conservation
laws
of
the
state
of
washington
to
which
they
are
not
legally
entitled.
by
virtue
of
the
claims
special
privileges
or
immunities,
the
defendants
are
fishing
extensively
in
the
puyallup
river
and
commencement
bay
with
set
nets
and
drift
nets.
paragraph
six,
as
a
result
of
the
defendants
fishery,
the
anadromous
fish
runs
and
the
puyallup
river
will
be
virtually
extinguished,
exterminated
if
said
fishery
is
permitted
to
continue
and
no
adequate
and
speedy
remedy
and
so
forth
in
the
prairie.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
you
would
be
trading
the
resource
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
would
not
be
my
client’s
position
and
that
is
not,
i
do
not
believe
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
is
not
a
fair
reading
of
the
treaty
provision
and
it
is
not
a
fair
reading
of
the
decision
who
want
that
might
be
applicable
or
might
apply.
i
would
also
add
in
response
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
with
all
other
citizens
whether
it
be
sport
or
commercial,
i
would
like
to
point
out
there
is
no
discrimination
against
indians
to
go
outside
their
reservation
and
engage
in
either
sport
fishing
activities
or
commercial
fishing
activities
pursuant
to
state
regulations.
so
that
there
is
not
this
discrimination
and
really,
the
point,
the
reason
why
i
went
back
and
read
the
book
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
is
it,
it
is
a
quantification
question,
a
question
of
interpreting
the
language
and
attempting
to
quantify
it
and
i
am
submitting
to
the
court
that
if
fair
reading,
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
treaty
language
in
question
would
necessarily
imply
in
light
of
the
historical
circumstances
under
which
it
was
executed
that
indians
were
entitled
or
given
a
right
in
1854
-
55
not
to
be
discriminated
against,
keeping
in
mind
the
date,
the
historical
setting
in
which
these
treaties
were
executed,
that
fourteenth
amendment
was
in
the
future
and
if
pioneers
and
settlers
pursuant
to
government
policy
were
being
encouraged
to
move
out,
move
into
this
territory
and
let
us
settle
it,
let
us
take
it
over.
we
just
settle
things
with
the
nation
of
great
britain
and
we
wanted
to
the
hudson
bay
company
was
moving
out
and
we
wanted
to
populate
this
area.
the
government
obviously
had
a
problem.
they
had
to
go
out
and
treat
with
the
native
populations
and
part
of
the
deal
was
to
give
them
exclusive
rights.
to
give
them
a
place
to
reside
and
hopefully
to
be
integrated
into
society
in
sometime,
but
the
reservations,
--
the
subject
to
and
when
i
believe,
the
reservations
were
intended
to
be
temporary.
they
have
not
turned
out
to
be
that
way.
i
am
not
quarreling
with
that.
i
believe
that
is
the
law
today,
but
certainly
when
you
compare
the
exclusive
rights
to
fish
and
hunt
within
the
reservation
which
clearly
was
understood
i
believe
by
everyone
at
that
time,
i
think
you
keep
that
fact
in
mind
when
you
look
at
the
quantum
any
if
you
will
of
the
off
reservation
in
common
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
yes,
i
am
trying
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
in
my
view,
the
question
of
treaty
interpretation
does
not
depend
upon
the
species
of
fish.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
agree.
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
otherwise,
you
are
going
to
have
a
bifurcated
analysis,
a
bifurcated
law
if
you
will.
depending
upon
the
way
the
state
legislature
decides
to
classify
a
fish.
the
treaty
says
the
right
to
fish
at
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
in
common.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
do
not
agree
with
that
because
i
recognize
the
government
is
urging
upon
the
court
that
this
is
foreclosed.
i
am
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
the
treaty
does
not
say
salmon.
the
treaty
does
not
say
steelhead.
the
treaty
does
not
say
trout
or
bass
or
any
other
species.
it
says
the
right
to
fish
and
i
honestly
believed
that
the
impact
of
this
court’s
decision
would
be
to
establish
a
common
rule,
which
would
apply
to
all
species
of
fish,
which
might
be
subject
to
commercial
netting
activities
in
off
reservation
waters
of
the
state.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well?
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
is
not
my
real
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
perhaps,
i
did
not
express
myself
well
enough
in
my
statement
of
the
issues
in
the
brief
or
in
the
petition.
but
at
page
10,
the
first
issue
stated
in
my
brief
is
whether
the
equal
protection
concepts
in
the
treaty
phrase
is
common
with
all
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
it
means
that
treaty
indians
must
abide
by
state
conservation
laws
and
regulations
when
they
engage
in
fishing
in
off
reservation
waters
and
clearly
the
treaty
itself,
which
is
the
fundamental
predicate
from
which
we
are
going
to
legally
operate
does
not
make
this
distinction.
and
i
believe
that
the
actual
impact
of
any
decision
of
this
court
will
not
be
limited
to
given
specie
of
fish.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
it
would
be
as
appendix
a
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
file
on
september
20th
,
1972.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
and
it
is
in
appendix
which
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
now,
i
might
add
in
another
point
here
to
this
question
of
treaty
interpretation
which
i
feel
is
quite
humane
and
frankly,
i
feel
is
important
as
an
interpretive
aid
to
the
court
in
interpreting
the
content
or
quantification.
if
you
will
or
meaning
to
be
common
with
language
as
it
might
pertain
to
off
reservation
fishing
and
hunting
is
the
rather
interesting
fact
that
the
in
common
with
language
does
appear
in
another
context.
in
a
governor
steven’s
treaty
and
that
is
the
treaty
with
the
yakima.
now
the
treaty
with
the
yakima
provides
in
addition
to
the
usual
off
reservation,
usual
language
on
the
right
in
common
to
fish
at
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
and
station,
and
it
also
provides
the
following,
as
is
also
the
right
in
common
with
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
travel
upon
all
the
public
highways.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
rather
unusual
result
to
obtain
if
this
application
of
state
police
power
is
in
a
form
of
traffic
rules
and
regulations
on
public
highways.
if
there
is
a
constitutional
impediment
to
the
application
of
the
state
laws
in
that
regard
in
the
terms
of
the
fishing,
the
context
of
fishing
but
we
could
really
reach
the
very
strange
result
if
we
attempted
to
apply
that
rationale
to
this
language,
which
appears
in
the
treaty
with
the
yakima.
and
i
frankly
do
not
know
what
the
answer
would
be
to
the
problem
that
i
supposed,
but
i
am
relying
upon
the
language
in
the
yakima
treaty
at
least
as
an
interpretive
aid.
in
other
words,
where
the
same
languages
as
used
by
the
same
author,
in
this
case,
governor
isaac
i.
stevens.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
did
not
believe
that
that
is
--
in
my
judgment,
i
did
not
believe
that
that
would
resolve
the
question
for
you
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
studies
that
the
department
has
undertaken
regarding
the
extent
of
hatchery
contributions
to
sport
catch
reach
somewhat
varying
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
in
that
sense
it
maybe.
i
still
maintain
before
the
court
that
what
should
be
relevant
but
what
were
the
relative
circumstances
of
the
parties
read
the
entire
instrument
as
a
whole.
keeping
in
mind
the
exclusive
nature
of
the
rights,
which
were
to
be
granted
and
confirmed
to
the
indian
tribes
in
terms
of
their
on
reservation
fishing,
and
hunting
activities,
and
the
contrast
in
that
with
the
off
reservation
in
common
with
language,
keeping
in
mind
the
fact
that
indians
were
not
citizens
at
that
time,
and
keeping
in
mind
that
this
language
does
appear
in
another
context
in
that
article
iii
of
the
treaty
with
the
yakima
and
that
should
the
court
reach
a
result
in
interpreting
in
common
with
to
mean
exclusive
paramount
or
prior
in
some
sense.
so
that
they
have
a
right
to
catch
these
fish
perhaps
superior
to
all
other
citizens
that
they
may
be
able
to
catch
all
the
fish
and
the
citizens
not
any.
then
suppose
at
that
point,
your
honor
that
then
these
considerations
that
you
have
mentioned
of
the
extent
of
the
contribution
to
the
resource
by
public
funds
would
become
relevant
and
important.
but
unless,
i
believe
that
you
have
to
first
answer
or
reach
the
question
of
some
sort
of
quantification
and
it
is
only
at
that
point
that
you
would
then
begin
to
judicially
inquire
into
well,
--
perhaps
the
native
runs
would
not
be
as
high
with
absent
the
contribution
of
the
state.
and
i
might
add
that
the
federal
government
for
that
matter
to
the
resource
in
form
of
fish
passage
facilities
at
dams,
stream
plants,
projects,
hatchery
programs.
i
just
mentioned
the
washington
department
of
game,
our
lowest
study
shows
that
on
the
puyallup
with
the
lowest
contribution
in
a
single
year,
i
believe
was
60%
running
as
high
as
80%
of
total
catch
developed
from
our
hatching
program,
which
for
the
most
part
is
financed
by
the
sale.
approximately
80%
financed
by
the
sale
of
fishing
licenses
of
steelhead
punch
cards.
so,
the
sportsman
himself
are
--
you
might
say
paying
for
a
large
part
of
the
resource,
but
i
still
maintain
that
we
do
not
reach
this
question
unless
we
first
have
reached
the
fundamental
question
of
what
is
it
that
was
secured.
it
is
my
primary
argument
to
you
to
that
level
rather
than
to
the
level
that
you
have
suggested.
although
in
my
brief,
i
will
admit
i
do
take
an
alternative
position.
there
is
a
recent
opinion
post
to
puyallup
and
post
to
mescalero
a
copy
of
which
i
passed
to
be
you
at
large
with
clerk
of
the
court
entitled
settler
v.
yakima
tribal
council,
or
excuse
me,
yakima
tribe
court
was
issued
by
the
federal
district
court
for
the
federal
district
--
the
eastern
district
of
washington
by
the
honorable
george
h.
powell
on
september
26,
1973.
this
is
the
only
decision
that
i
am
aware
of
on
a
federal
level,
which
deals
with
puyallup
and
mescalero
and
the
issue
before
the
court,
it
is
not
obviously
in
my
brief.
as
i
mentioned
the
copiously
lies.
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
or
not
the
yakimas
passed
a
regulation
pertaining
to
off
reservation
fishing
by
yakima
indians
on
the
columbia
river,
and
then
went
down
on
the
river
and
arrested
a
couple
of
members
of
the
tribe
who
were
violating
those
regulations
for
about
60
miles
off
the
reservation,got
them
back
and
try
to
convict
them.
the
issue
then
was
whether
or
not
they
had
jurisdiction.
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
washington
relying
on
the
puyallup-mescalero
rationale
held
that
the
yakimas
do
not
have
extra
territorial
jurisdiction.
i
know
that
white
light
is
on
and
i
would
like
to
if
i
may
reserve
the
two
or
three
moments
remaining
to
me
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor,
(inaudible)
mr.
chief
justice.
first
point
i’d
like
to
make
is
that
steelhead
as
a
game
fish
may
only
be
taken
with
broken
line
in
waters
in
the
state
of
washington.
there
is
no
salt
water
or
marine
commercial
fishery
for
the
species
and
no
sport
fishery
to
any
substantial
extent
at
all
occurs
in
salt
water.
therefore,
the
only
place
where
steelhead
maybe
taken
under
state
law
is
by
hook
and
line
in
fresh
water
streams
at
the
very
same
locations
that
this
indians
are
claiming
rights
to
put
commercial
fish.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
no,
i
am
merely
advising
the
court
that
that
is
a
fact.
that
is
where
the
fishery
occurs,
that
is
the
sport
fishing
occurs.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
okay,
in
the
past
up
until
now,
that’s
where
it
has
occurred.
there
is
no
commercial
marine
fishery.
these
are
not
commercial
fish.
there
is
no
commercial
market
for
steelhead
in
the
state
of
washington.
they
are
a
game
fish
and
i
wanted
to
make
that
point.
second
point
is
i
wanted
to
just
simply
briefly
re
emphasize
mescalero-ward
versus
racehorse
as
a
part
of
the
reading
of
the
equal
protection
concepts
implicit
in
the
treaty
language.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct
and
i
agree
with
the
statements
made
by
counsel
the
way
the
issues
are
delineated
before
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
--
they
are
okay.
the
basic
way
that
they
where
wrong
is
that
they
are
allowing
the
director
of
the
department
of
fisheries
to
set
special
indian
only
seasons
for
commercial
harvest
of
fish
in
off
reservation
waters
contrary
to
the
treaty
language.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
understand
you.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
the
department
of
fisheries
has
not
the
department
of
game.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
yes,
they
have
in
a
number
of
fishes.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
not
the
steelheads.
steelheads
are
under
game
jurisdiction,
the
salmon
are
under
the
fisheries
jurisdiction
bound
under
state
law.
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
with
respect
to
steelhead
it
had
imposed
an
additional
burden
upon
the
washington
department
of
game
in
that,
it
has
to
demonstrate
annually
that
it
is
quote
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
under
all
series
of
court
challenges
and
that
leads
me
to
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
leave
--
mr.
joseph
l.
coniff,
jr.
under
the
language
of
opinion
that
it
indicates
that
the
sport
fishery,
being
a
very
efficient
fishery,
broken
line
is
opposed
to
a
net
would
be
satisfying.
and
then
if
it
can
be
demonstrated,
there
is
a
surplus
at
that
point;
it
is
then
incumbent
under
the
state
of
the
law,
under
the
opinion
below
to
establish
this
special
commercial
season
on
game
fish
of
steelhead
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
discrimination
under
state
law
in
off
reservation
areas.
there
is
and
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
civil
unrest
in
the
state,
a
great
deal
of
confrontations,
riverbank,
shoot
outs
if
you
will.
our
game
department
headquarters
have
even
been
taken
over.
offices
are
ransacked
and
so
forth
and
i
really
point
out
that
in
light
of
these
facts
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
are
a
number
of
pending
cases
including
us
versus
washington
that
there
is
a
definite
need
for
clarification
beyond
that
given
us
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
thank
you.
