mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
start
out
by
saying
that
i
think
the
department
of
game's
position
is
contrary
to
its
own
state
court's
finding,
contrary
to
its
own
department
fisheries
position,
tries
to
take
out
nothing
at
all,
just
out
of
air
on
argument
that
would
eradicate
the
third
article
of
the
treaty
with
the
puyallup’s
and
it
would
jeopardize
almost
every
indian
treaty
in
the
country.
the
idea
when
a
state
comes
in
to
the
state
that
it
can
then
ignore
whatever
treaty
had
been
made
by
the
united
states
prior
to
the
time
that
it
came
into
the
state
because
other
states
did
not
have
treaties
with
indians
and
this
would
have
to
be
equal
footing.
but
before
i
get
into
that
in
much
detail,
i
want
to
say
i
also
think
that
it's
based
on
total
misunderstanding
of
this
court’s
prior
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
coniff
argues
that
this
court’s
prior
decision
in
this
case
because
of
the
one
phrase
that
in
determining
whether
the
regulation
is
necessary
for
conservation
you
should
take
into
account
the
issue
of
equal
protection,
implicit
in
the
phrase
in
common
with
means
that
whatever
law
is
the
state
passes
that
labels
as
conservation
laws
apply
equally
to
the
indians
and
non-indians
in
the
state.
that
is
the
exact
position
that
this
court
rejected
when
it
affirmed
the
decision
below
in
the
prior
puyallup
case.
what
had
happened
there,
this
was
the
position
that
mr.
coniff
had
argued
in
the
lower
court
in
the
state
of
washington
in
1963,
i
think
it
was.
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
washington
in
1967
rejected
that
position
and
held
that
the
essence
of
this
opinion
is
and
the
decree
as
reframed
just
so
reflect.
one
if
a
defendant
proves
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
puyallup
tribe
and
two,
he
is
fishing
at
one
of
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
places
of
that
tribe.
three,
he
cannot
be
restrained
or
enjoined
from
doing
so
unless
he
is
in
violation
of
a
statute
or
regulation
that
the
department
has
promulgated
there
under
which
has
been
established
to
be
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
the
fishery.
and
when
this
court
had
the
case,
it
made
perfectly
clear
i
think
that
the
issue
was,
the
issue
was
the
following
that
in
the
treaty,
the
tribe
reserved
for
itself
the
right
to
fishing
off
reservation,
but
it
limited
that
right
and
that
it
is
fishing
in
common
with
the
people
of
this
state
and
the
court
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
usual
and
custom
places,
that’s
right.
there
is
no
issue
here
that
these
are
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
it
means
more
than
that
and
different
from
that
and
i
will
try
to
get
to
that
in
just
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
puyallup
one
says
that
the
treaty
doesn’t
say
anything
as
to
the
manner.
sir?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
puyallup
one
decision,
the
prior
decision
of
this
court?
i
think
it
said
that
the
state
is
free
to
regulate
the
manner
of
fishing
if
it
can
show
that
it
is
necessary
for
conservation
and
that
it
does
not
discriminate
against
the
indians
in
doing
so.
i
think
the
real
point
in
this
case
is
the
point
that
i
want
to
get
to
in
a
minute
is
whether
the
regulation
of
the
department
of
game
in
this
case
has
been
shown
to
be
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
fish.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes
sir
on
page
402
in
the
footnote,
it's
footnote
14,
the
court
said
as
to
a
regulation
concerning
the
time
and
manner
of
fishing
outside
the
reservation,
we
say
that
the
power
of
the
state
was
to
be
measured
by
whether
it
was
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
fish,
and
the
court
then
contrasted
the
lesser
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
indian
fishing
from
its
general
police
power
and
i
think
that
is
also
[voice
overlap]
in
the
affirmance
of
the
court
below.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
look
at
the
case
as
a
whole
and
i
would
say
that
this
case
affirmed
the
decision
below,
which
held
in
accordance
with
several
other
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
standard
is
whether
it
is
necessary
for
the
regulation
of
fish,
and
that
this
court
actually
went
further
with
puyallup.
it
said
that
the
court
should
show
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
regulation
of
fish
and
implicit
in
that
is
the
idea
that
the
regulation
should
not
be
discriminatory
against
the
indians
in
the
sense
that
it
should
not
make
them
bear
the
whole
burden
of
the
conservation
regulation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
to
start
of
with
the
court
in
puyallup
one
assumed
that
the
indian
did
fish
commercially.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that
would
be
a
difficult
question.
i
think
the
better
argument
would
be
--
the
better
answer
would
be
that
yes
that
it
did.
what
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
do
not
think
so
because
at
the
time
of
this
treaty,
these
indians
did
fish
commercially
and
the
record
when
the
case
was
here
before
statement
of
an
anthropologist
to
the
effect
that
these
indians
were
supplying
the
hudson
bay
company
with
their
salmon
and
steelhead
at
the
time
of
this
treaty
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
which
they
caught
with
nets.
they
fished
with
nets,
they
fished
commercially
and
i
think
also,
the
court
has
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes
sir.
well
let
me
say
this,
the
record
of
this
case
doesn’t
show
that
it
was
with
a
gill
net.
indians
in
that
general
area
did
fish
with
gill
nets
before
the
white
man
came
and
there
is
a
statement
to
that
effect
in
the
book
called
the
kroever
in
the
indians
of
the
northwest
coast,
which
describes
how
they
made
the
nets
and
how
the
big
nets
were.
it
is
not
the
gill
nets
and
not
an
invention
of
the
white
man.
i
think
a
good
deal
of
what
mr.
coniff
has
argued
were
the
same
points
that
where
argued
in
the
wyman’s
case
in
1905
and
that
where
rejected
in
that
case.
i
want
to
take
a
minute
on
that
and
then
i
want
to
get
into
the
questions
of
this
present
regulations
and
what
this
has
to
do
with
the
conservation
of
fish
today.
to
start
of
with,
when
the
treaty
was
made,
this
treaty
like,
treaty
with
yakamas
with
all
the
treaties
northwest
coast
did
three
things:
they
start
with
peaceful
treaties.
governor
stevens
was
sent
in
to
negotiate
with
the
indians.
in
each
treaty,
there
is
a
clause
in
which
the
indians
cede
to
the
united
states
a
very
large
section
of
land
that
they
had
occupied.
there
is
a
second
clause
in
which
the
indians
reserve
to
themselves
a
very
small
piece
of
land
on
which
they
were
to
live.
and
there
is
a
third
clause
in
which
they
reserve
to
themselves
the
right
of
fishing
at
all
their
usual
and
accustomed
places
in
common
with
the
people
of
the
territory
and
the
right,
putting
up
houses
and
so
forth
to
dry
their
fish
at
those
places.
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
that
third
clause
was
considered
necessary
for
them
to
be
able
to
maintain
themselves
if
the
land
they
were
giving
up
was
large.
the
land
they
were
keeping
was
too
small
for
them
to
make
a
living
on
and
the
treaty
was
negotiated
in
a
kind
of
jargon,
it
was
called
a
chinook
jargon.
there
is
also
evidence
in
the
first
record
here
that
the
treaty
was
translated
to
the
indians
in
very
simple
terms
and
what
it
obviously
meant
to
them
was
that
they
had
to
give
up
the
big
land.
they
had
to
live
on
the
smaller
land
but
they
could
continue
to
fish
at
the
usual
places
that
they
could
fish
but
that
they
were
no
longer
have
that
exclusive
right
that
the
settlers
would
be
able
to
fish
there
too.
it
is
just
--
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
said
they
submitted
to
regulation
by
the
state.
there
is
noting
in
it
that
said
we
want
to
be
sport
fisherman
and
go
out
and
angle.
they
were
fishing
to
feed
their
families
and
to
trade.
and
since
that
time,
they
continued
to
fish
that
way
except
when
the
state
has
prohibited
them
from
fishing
that
way.
now,
in
united
states
versus
winans,
1905,
winans
was
a
landowner
who
had
set
up
a
fish
wheel
to
make
a
large
commercial
fishery
on
the
columbia
river.
it
was
under
license
with,
from
the
state
and
also
under
state
law
no
one
would
have
the
right
to
come
on
his
land
anyway
to
fish.
winans
argued
that
all
the
treaty
means
is
that
indians
must
obey
all
the
fishing
laws
of
the
state
and
if
they
do,
they
can
then
continue
to
fish
but
they
had
no
special
treaty
right.
and
winans
argued
this
case
of
ward
versus
racehorse
that
had
been
decided
seven
or
eight
years
before
that
and
that
mr.
coniff
relies
on.
he
said,
the
treaty
may
have
been
fine
for
the
old
days
but
when
washington
came
into
this
state,
this
indians
lost
any
special
right
that
they
had
prior
to
that
time.
and
this
court
strongly
rejected
both
of
those
arguments
in
the
winans
case.
the
court
explained
that
the
right
to
fish
was
part
of
the
right
and
i
quote
here,
“not
much
less
necessary
to
the
indians
than
the
atmosphere
they
breathe.”
the
court
said
that
in
ceding
most
of
their
land,
they
did
not
cede
their
fishing
rights,
but
only
limited
them
to
be
no
longer
exclusive.
and
that
to
interpret
those
rights
retained
as
giving
them
nothing
more
than
they
would
have
without
the
treaty
would
be
in
the
words
of
the
court
an
impotent
outcome
to
negotiations
and
the
convention
that
would
seem
to
promise
more
and
to
give
the
word
of
the
nation
for
more.
the
court
also
said,
the
right
was
intended
to
be
continuing
against
the
united
states
and
its
grantees
as
well
as
against
the
state
and
its
grantees.
in
tully
versus
washington
in
1942,
justice
black
for
the
court
in
the
same
vain
strongly
supported
the
specialness
of
these
indian
fishing
rights
and
the
right
of
their
right
to
fish
even
without
paying
for
a
commercial
fishing
license.
still
that
was
argued
to
the
court
as
a
conservation
requirement,
to
have
them
pay
the
commercial
fishing
license.
justice
black
said,
even
though
this
method
maybe
both
convenient
and
its
general
impact
fair,
it
acts
upon
the
indians
as
a
charge
for
exercising
the
very
right
their
ancestors
intended
to
preserve.
it
cannot
be
reconciled
with
a
fair
construction
of
the
treaty.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
state
and
hold
the
state
statute
invalid
as
applied
in
this
case.
now,
justice
douglas
in
the
prior
puyallup
case
cited
both
those
cases
with
approval.
he
stated
that
the
court
say
that
he
would
not
say
the
fishing
regulation
had
to
be
indispensable
for
conservation,
but
they
would
say
it
had
to
be
necessary
for
conservation
and
they
could
not
discriminate
against
the
indians
and
then
remanded
the
case
for
trial
on
the
issue
of
whether
these
regulations
were
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
you
affirmed
and
remanded
for
a
trial
on
the
merits
on
the
question
of
whether
the
regulations
were
necessary
for
a
conservation
and
not
discriminate
against
the
indians.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
that
trial.
to
start
with
when
the
case
was
remanded,
the
department
of
fisheries
immediately
changed
its
position.
fisheries
had
argued
that
you
couldn’t
have
a
net
fishery
for
any
fish
in
the
puyallup
river.
fisheries
changed
this
and
they
argued
on
this
basis.
they
said
you
cannot
have
a
fishery
where
the
fish
spawn
and
you
cannot
have
a
fishery
where
the
fish
are
milling
about
in
the
same
fish
will
be
fished
over
and
over.
and
was
that
language
that
the
court
quoted
that
you
cannot
have
this
fishery
where
the
fish
were
milling
about
over
and
over.
well,
the
department
of
fisheries
did
a
reasonable
thing.
they
said,
we
will
prohibit
the
fishery
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
where
the
fish
mill
over
and
over
and
over
and
we
will
prohibit
the
fishery
20
miles
upstream
where
the
fish
are
actually
spawning
and
where
people
are
walking
around
there
with
nets
would
be
destructive
to
the
fish.
but
in
the
middle
area,
we
will
permit
a
limited
net
fishery
for
salmon.
there
is
still
a
dispute
between
the
tribe
and
the
department
of
fisheries
as
to
how
big
that
fishery
ought
to
be
but
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
for
salmon,
it
is
not
before
the
court
but
it
does
indicate
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
net
fishing
can
properly
be
manage
in
that
river.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
at
least
for
salmon.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there
at
least
a
dozen
statements
in
the
record
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
in
the
management
of
nets
and
so
forth
or
salmon
or
steelhead
that
steelhead
very
much
like
salmon
in
all
their
habits.
there
are
statements
that
steelhead
run
is
a
smaller
run.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
right.
now,
the
size
of
the
steelhead
population
in
this
stream
has
been
sufficient
every
year
in
recent
years.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no.
what
i
am
asking
you
to
do
is
to
affirm
the
state
trial
court's
finding
of
the
facts
and
to
reverse
state
supreme
court's
reversing
the
trial
court's
finding.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
they
haven’t
reversed
on
factual
ground.
they
have
reversed
on
misunderstanding
of
the
law
and
i
think
i
can
show
it
to
you
very
soon.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
just
want
the
court
to
understand
that
we
are
not
proposing
something
that
it
is
detrimental
to
the
fish
in
that
area
or
that
has
to
do
with
conservation.
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
the
state
has
the
right
to
appropriate
the
fish
first
for
sports
fisherman
and
to
totally
exclude
the
traditional
indian
fishing
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no
i
am
not
because
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
set
up
a
standard
that
has
assured
that
every
year
since
then,
that
the
indian
fishing
will
also
be
prohibited
and
that
has
occurred
in
each
year
since
then
and
--
let
me
show
you
this
language.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
let
me
give
you
two.
i
think
i
can
answer
this
graphically
for
you.
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
were
the
15
to
18,000
fish
were
being
taken
per
year
by
sports
fisherman.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
steelheads,
steelheads,
i’m
talking
only
about
steelheads.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
steelhead.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about.
and
the
most
succinct
statements
in
the
opinion
of
the
trail
court
says
in
view
of
the
large
number
of
steelhead
caught
in
the
puyallup
river,
it
would
seem
that
the
department
is
not
in
a
position
to
say
the
indians
can
be
entirely
excluded
from
the
exercise
of
any
special
right.
okay,
now,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
referred
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
sir?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
as
a
commercial
fishery
or
fishery
for
their
own?
yes,
such
as
commercial
fishery.
the
washington
supreme
court
reversed
that.
they
did
not
reverse
the
find.
they
did
not
argue
with
the
findings
that
13
to
18,000
fish
are
being
taken
each
year
by
sports
fisherman.
now
what
they
said
is,
the
catch
of
the
steelheads
for
fishery
alone
in
the
puyallup
river
leaves
no
more
than
a
sufficient
number
of
steelhead
for
escapement
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
the
steelhead
fishery
in
the
river.
and
so,
they
reversed
the
lower
court,
upheld
with
prohibition
for
fishing
for
steelheads
with
net
and
said
that
until
that
each
year
this
should
be
reviewed
and
when
there
are
enough
left
over
after
the
sport
fisherman
are
through,
the
indians
can
come
in
and
if
the
department
of
games
says
that
there
are
enough,
indians
can
fish
for
those.

i
have
the

to
it

my

mr.

it
is

it
is
in
this
–
mr.
harry

sachse
that
is
the
holding
in
the
case.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
washington
in
this
case,
but
the
supreme
court
clearly
established,
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
washington
clearly
established
a
priority
for
sports
fishermen
in
deciding
whether
an
indian
fishery
can
be
allowed
in
the
puyallup
river
and
they
have
established
that
priority
in
section
four
of
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
what
we
are
quarreling
about
and
we
are
also,
i
think
you
can
see
why
we
are
quarreling
about
it
because
the
department
of
game
of
the
state
of
washington
still
contests
the
right
of
the
indians
to
have
any
fishery
there
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
do
not
know
about
that.
the
evidence
doesn’t
show
one
way
or
another
as
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
the
court
found
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
my
real
argument
is
that
this
treaty
provided
the
indians
with
an
off
reservation
fishing
right
beyond
the
simple
fishing
of
other
people
in
the
state.
that
the
treaty
should
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
its
meaning
and
context,
which
was
that
these
people
would
be
able
to
some
extent
support
themselves
and
feed
themselves
from
these
fishing
rights.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
right,
that
they
can’t
take
the
entire
harvestable
fishery
here
and
devote
it
entirely
to
a
sports
fishery
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
(voice
overlap)
who
fish
here?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
at
all.
i
wish
to
point
out
also
that
the
federal
government
has
a
large
fishery
development
program
in
connection
with
indians
and
indian
reservations
and
then
just
in
general
and
that
the
federal
government
also
plants
fish
in
the
rivers.
though
not
in
the
puyallup
and
if
the
state
wanted
to
stop
planting
the
fish
in
the
puyallup,
the
federal
government
very
likely
would
stop
planting
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
to
this
extent
that
it
makes
the
larger
run,
it
makes
the
larger
harvestable
amount
and
to
take
that
harvest
full
amount
and
give
a
preference
to
sports
fisherman
for
that
harvest
amount
in
an
area
where
the
indians
have
traditionally
fished
and
where
they
relied
on
fishing;
part
of
their
life
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
not
--
there
is
nothing
in
--
as
to
second
part,
desire
to
conduct,
there
is
evidence
as
to
a
few
years
when
the
indian
owned
salmon.
when
the
indians
had
a
large
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
size
of
commercial
fishery
on
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
as
far
as
i
know
they
fished
steelhead
mainly
for
their
own
sustenance
and
there
is
no
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no
i
cannot
say
that
because
there
are
on
the
--
when
all
of
the
reservation
grants
since
there
is
a
commercial
steelhead
fishery
and
sports
fishery,
they
are
conducted
together
by
the
trial
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
let
me
say
this
that
the
indians
traditional
and
to
this
day
do
not
make
much
of
a
distinction
between
steelhead
and
salmon.
there
is
steelhead
and
salmon
guarderia,
it
is
salmony
guarderia,
the
big
fish
like
salmon
and
the
fish
the
same
way,
and
there
are
commercial
markets
for
steelhead
too.
but
there
is
no
solid
evidence
as
to
what
the
indians
would
want
if
for
instance,
they
were
allowed
to
fish
legally
for
these
fish.
now,
i
actually
say
this.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
determine
how
many
fish
the
indians
should
get
or
how
many
fish
the
sports
fisherman
should
get.
there
is
another
case
underway.
the
district
court,
the
federal
district
court
in
the
state
of
washington
call
it
united
states
versus
washington
where
the
attempt
is
somehow
to
quantify
the
fishing
rights
of
the
indians.
it
deals
primarily
with
salmon,
but
it
also
can
deal
with
the
steelhead
issue
and
there
is
a
very
big
record
there.
but
what
does
seem
to
clear
to
us
is
that
in
19
--
for
the
1970
regulation,
for
every
regulation
since
then
based
on
this
conclusion
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
that
the
sports
fisherman
have
to
come
first.
that
the
indians
are
being
deprived
of
their
share
of
the
fishing
for
steelhead
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
claim
a
discrimination
against
their
treaty
rights.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
a
denial
of
their
treaty
rights.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
there
is
a
discrimination
too.
i
do
claim
it
and
i
want
to
make
this
clear
that
the
indians
fish
in
the
rivers
and
there’s
--
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
the
record
on
this,
part
of
the
reason
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
money
to
go
out
and
fish
deep-sea
fishing
and
the
state
has
evidence
that
its
costs
$122.00
per
fish
to
catch
a
steelhead
as
a
sports
fish.
i
mean,
they
do
not
have
that
kind
of
money
and
they
have
always
fished
near
where
they
lived
in
the
river
where
they
can
fish
on
rather
occasional
basis
often
after
they
come
back
from
whatever
--
what
other
job
they
might
have
and
it
is
a
discrimination
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it's
like
this.
if
all
the
black
people
lived
in
a
particular
neighborhood
and
the
white
people
lived
in
a
different
neighborhood
and
the
court
said
in
this
black
neighborhood
nobody
can
work
in
his
yard.
in
this
neighborhood,
nobody
can
work,
nobody
can
have
a
business
and
the
other
neighborhood
you
can.
i
think
you
could
find
there
is
a
discrimination
there.
that
the
fishing
has
been
prohibited
in
the
place
where
the
indians
fish
and
it
is
deliberate,
it
is
deliberate.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
it
is
the
manner
of
fishing
that
this
indians
used
to
fish,
and
there
is
no
showing
that
it's
necessary
for
conservation
to
prohibit
that.
it
can
be
regulated
and
handled
very
well,
it
is
being
handled
on
indian
reservations
and
on
this
river
with
salmons.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
correct,
two
petitions.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
exactly
correct.
and
we
also
say
that
the
remedy
here
has
to
be
looked
to
carefully
because
the
indians
have
been
deprived
for
a
long
time
of
these
rights.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
holding
was
with
respect
to
1979
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
start
out
by
saying
that
i
think
the
department
of
game's
position
is
contrary
to
its
own
state
court's
finding,
contrary
to
its
own
department
fisheries
position,
tries
to
take
out
nothing
at
all,
just
out
of
air
on
argument
that
would
eradicate
the
third
article
of
the
treaty
with
the
puyallup’s
and
it
would
jeopardize
almost
every
indian
treaty
in
the
country.
the
idea
when
a
state
comes
in
to
the
state
that
it
can
then
ignore
whatever
treaty
had
been
made
by
the
united
states
prior
to
the
time
that
it
came
into
the
state
because
other
states
did
not
have
treaties
with
indians
and
this
would
have
to
be
equal
footing.
but
before
i
get
into
that
in
much
detail,
i
want
to
say
i
also
think
that
it's
based
on
total
misunderstanding
of
this
court’s
prior
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
coniff
argues
that
this
court’s
prior
decision
in
this
case
because
of
the
one
phrase
that
in
determining
whether
the
regulation
is
necessary
for
conservation
you
should
take
into
account
the
issue
of
equal
protection,
implicit
in
the
phrase
in
common
with
means
that
whatever
law
is
the
state
passes
that
labels
as
conservation
laws
apply
equally
to
the
indians
and
non-indians
in
the
state.
that
is
the
exact
position
that
this
court
rejected
when
it
affirmed
the
decision
below
in
the
prior
puyallup
case.
what
had
happened
there,
this
was
the
position
that
mr.
coniff
had
argued
in
the
lower
court
in
the
state
of
washington
in
1963,
i
think
it
was.
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
washington
in
1967
rejected
that
position
and
held
that
the
essence
of
this
opinion
is
and
the
decree
as
reframed
just
so
reflect.
one
if
a
defendant
proves
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
puyallup
tribe
and
two,
he
is
fishing
at
one
of
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
places
of
that
tribe.
three,
he
cannot
be
restrained
or
enjoined
from
doing
so
unless
he
is
in
violation
of
a
statute
or
regulation
that
the
department
has
promulgated
there
under
which
has
been
established
to
be
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
the
fishery.
and
when
this
court
had
the
case,
it
made
perfectly
clear
i
think
that
the
issue
was,
the
issue
was
the
following
that
in
the
treaty,
the
tribe
reserved
for
itself
the
right
to
fishing
off
reservation,
but
it
limited
that
right
and
that
it
is
fishing
in
common
with
the
people
of
this
state
and
the
court
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
usual
and
custom
places,
that’s
right.
there
is
no
issue
here
that
these
are
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
it
means
more
than
that
and
different
from
that
and
i
will
try
to
get
to
that
in
just
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
puyallup
one
says
that
the
treaty
doesn’t
say
anything
as
to
the
manner.
sir?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
puyallup
one
decision,
the
prior
decision
of
this
court?
i
think
it
said
that
the
state
is
free
to
regulate
the
manner
of
fishing
if
it
can
show
that
it
is
necessary
for
conservation
and
that
it
does
not
discriminate
against
the
indians
in
doing
so.
i
think
the
real
point
in
this
case
is
the
point
that
i
want
to
get
to
in
a
minute
is
whether
the
regulation
of
the
department
of
game
in
this
case
has
been
shown
to
be
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
fish.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes
sir
on
page
402
in
the
footnote,
it's
footnote
14,
the
court
said
as
to
a
regulation
concerning
the
time
and
manner
of
fishing
outside
the
reservation,
we
say
that
the
power
of
the
state
was
to
be
measured
by
whether
it
was
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
fish,
and
the
court
then
contrasted
the
lesser
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
indian
fishing
from
its
general
police
power
and
i
think
that
is
also
[voice
overlap]
in
the
affirmance
of
the
court
below.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
would
look
at
the
case
as
a
whole
and
i
would
say
that
this
case
affirmed
the
decision
below,
which
held
in
accordance
with
several
other
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
standard
is
whether
it
is
necessary
for
the
regulation
of
fish,
and
that
this
court
actually
went
further
with
puyallup.
it
said
that
the
court
should
show
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
regulation
of
fish
and
implicit
in
that
is
the
idea
that
the
regulation
should
not
be
discriminatory
against
the
indians
in
the
sense
that
it
should
not
make
them
bear
the
whole
burden
of
the
conservation
regulation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
to
start
of
with
the
court
in
puyallup
one
assumed
that
the
indian
did
fish
commercially.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that
would
be
a
difficult
question.
i
think
the
better
argument
would
be
--
the
better
answer
would
be
that
yes
that
it
did.
what
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
do
not
think
so
because
at
the
time
of
this
treaty,
these
indians
did
fish
commercially
and
the
record
when
the
case
was
here
before
statement
of
an
anthropologist
to
the
effect
that
these
indians
were
supplying
the
hudson
bay
company
with
their
salmon
and
steelhead
at
the
time
of
this
treaty
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
which
they
caught
with
nets.
they
fished
with
nets,
they
fished
commercially
and
i
think
also,
the
court
has
to
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes
sir.
well
let
me
say
this,
the
record
of
this
case
doesn’t
show
that
it
was
with
a
gill
net.
indians
in
that
general
area
did
fish
with
gill
nets
before
the
white
man
came
and
there
is
a
statement
to
that
effect
in
the
book
called
the
kroever
in
the
indians
of
the
northwest
coast,
which
describes
how
they
made
the
nets
and
how
the
big
nets
were.
it
is
not
the
gill
nets
and
not
an
invention
of
the
white
man.
i
think
a
good
deal
of
what
mr.
coniff
has
argued
were
the
same
points
that
where
argued
in
the
wyman’s
case
in
1905
and
that
where
rejected
in
that
case.
i
want
to
take
a
minute
on
that
and
then
i
want
to
get
into
the
questions
of
this
present
regulations
and
what
this
has
to
do
with
the
conservation
of
fish
today.
to
start
of
with,
when
the
treaty
was
made,
this
treaty
like,
treaty
with
yakamas
with
all
the
treaties
northwest
coast
did
three
things:
they
start
with
peaceful
treaties.
governor
stevens
was
sent
in
to
negotiate
with
the
indians.
in
each
treaty,
there
is
a
clause
in
which
the
indians
cede
to
the
united
states
a
very
large
section
of
land
that
they
had
occupied.
there
is
a
second
clause
in
which
the
indians
reserve
to
themselves
a
very
small
piece
of
land
on
which
they
were
to
live.
and
there
is
a
third
clause
in
which
they
reserve
to
themselves
the
right
of
fishing
at
all
their
usual
and
accustomed
places
in
common
with
the
people
of
the
territory
and
the
right,
putting
up
houses
and
so
forth
to
dry
their
fish
at
those
places.
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
that
third
clause
was
considered
necessary
for
them
to
be
able
to
maintain
themselves
if
the
land
they
were
giving
up
was
large.
the
land
they
were
keeping
was
too
small
for
them
to
make
a
living
on
and
the
treaty
was
negotiated
in
a
kind
of
jargon,
it
was
called
a
chinook
jargon.
there
is
also
evidence
in
the
first
record
here
that
the
treaty
was
translated
to
the
indians
in
very
simple
terms
and
what
it
obviously
meant
to
them
was
that
they
had
to
give
up
the
big
land.
they
had
to
live
on
the
smaller
land
but
they
could
continue
to
fish
at
the
usual
places
that
they
could
fish
but
that
they
were
no
longer
have
that
exclusive
right
that
the
settlers
would
be
able
to
fish
there
too.
it
is
just
--
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
said
they
submitted
to
regulation
by
the
state.
there
is
noting
in
it
that
said
we
want
to
be
sport
fisherman
and
go
out
and
angle.
they
were
fishing
to
feed
their
families
and
to
trade.
and
since
that
time,
they
continued
to
fish
that
way
except
when
the
state
has
prohibited
them
from
fishing
that
way.
now,
in
united
states
versus
winans,
1905,
winans
was
a
landowner
who
had
set
up
a
fish
wheel
to
make
a
large
commercial
fishery
on
the
columbia
river.
it
was
under
license
with,
from
the
state
and
also
under
state
law
no
one
would
have
the
right
to
come
on
his
land
anyway
to
fish.
winans
argued
that
all
the
treaty
means
is
that
indians
must
obey
all
the
fishing
laws
of
the
state
and
if
they
do,
they
can
then
continue
to
fish
but
they
had
no
special
treaty
right.
and
winans
argued
this
case
of
ward
versus
racehorse
that
had
been
decided
seven
or
eight
years
before
that
and
that
mr.
coniff
relies
on.
he
said,
the
treaty
may
have
been
fine
for
the
old
days
but
when
washington
came
into
this
state,
this
indians
lost
any
special
right
that
they
had
prior
to
that
time.
and
this
court
strongly
rejected
both
of
those
arguments
in
the
winans
case.
the
court
explained
that
the
right
to
fish
was
part
of
the
right
and
i
quote
here,
“not
much
less
necessary
to
the
indians
than
the
atmosphere
they
breathe.”
the
court
said
that
in
ceding
most
of
their
land,
they
did
not
cede
their
fishing
rights,
but
only
limited
them
to
be
no
longer
exclusive.
and
that
to
interpret
those
rights
retained
as
giving
them
nothing
more
than
they
would
have
without
the
treaty
would
be
in
the
words
of
the
court
an
impotent
outcome
to
negotiations
and
the
convention
that
would
seem
to
promise
more
and
to
give
the
word
of
the
nation
for
more.
the
court
also
said,
the
right
was
intended
to
be
continuing
against
the
united
states
and
its
grantees
as
well
as
against
the
state
and
its
grantees.
in
tully
versus
washington
in
1942,
justice
black
for
the
court
in
the
same
vain
strongly
supported
the
specialness
of
these
indian
fishing
rights
and
the
right
of
their
right
to
fish
even
without
paying
for
a
commercial
fishing
license.
still
that
was
argued
to
the
court
as
a
conservation
requirement,
to
have
them
pay
the
commercial
fishing
license.
justice
black
said,
even
though
this
method
maybe
both
convenient
and
its
general
impact
fair,
it
acts
upon
the
indians
as
a
charge
for
exercising
the
very
right
their
ancestors
intended
to
preserve.
it
cannot
be
reconciled
with
a
fair
construction
of
the
treaty.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
state
and
hold
the
state
statute
invalid
as
applied
in
this
case.
now,
justice
douglas
in
the
prior
puyallup
case
cited
both
those
cases
with
approval.
he
stated
that
the
court
say
that
he
would
not
say
the
fishing
regulation
had
to
be
indispensable
for
conservation,
but
they
would
say
it
had
to
be
necessary
for
conservation
and
they
could
not
discriminate
against
the
indians
and
then
remanded
the
case
for
trial
on
the
issue
of
whether
these
regulations
were
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
you
affirmed
and
remanded
for
a
trial
on
the
merits
on
the
question
of
whether
the
regulations
were
necessary
for
a
conservation
and
not
discriminate
against
the
indians.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
that
trial.
to
start
with
when
the
case
was
remanded,
the
department
of
fisheries
immediately
changed
its
position.
fisheries
had
argued
that
you
couldn’t
have
a
net
fishery
for
any
fish
in
the
puyallup
river.
fisheries
changed
this
and
they
argued
on
this
basis.
they
said
you
cannot
have
a
fishery
where
the
fish
spawn
and
you
cannot
have
a
fishery
where
the
fish
are
milling
about
in
the
same
fish
will
be
fished
over
and
over.
and
was
that
language
that
the
court
quoted
that
you
cannot
have
this
fishery
where
the
fish
were
milling
about
over
and
over.
well,
the
department
of
fisheries
did
a
reasonable
thing.
they
said,
we
will
prohibit
the
fishery
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
where
the
fish
mill
over
and
over
and
over
and
we
will
prohibit
the
fishery
20
miles
upstream
where
the
fish
are
actually
spawning
and
where
people
are
walking
around
there
with
nets
would
be
destructive
to
the
fish.
but
in
the
middle
area,
we
will
permit
a
limited
net
fishery
for
salmon.
there
is
still
a
dispute
between
the
tribe
and
the
department
of
fisheries
as
to
how
big
that
fishery
ought
to
be
but
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
for
salmon,
it
is
not
before
the
court
but
it
does
indicate
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
net
fishing
can
properly
be
manage
in
that
river.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
at
least
for
salmon.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there
at
least
a
dozen
statements
in
the
record
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
in
the
management
of
nets
and
so
forth
or
salmon
or
steelhead
that
steelhead
very
much
like
salmon
in
all
their
habits.
there
are
statements
that
steelhead
run
is
a
smaller
run.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
right.
now,
the
size
of
the
steelhead
population
in
this
stream
has
been
sufficient
every
year
in
recent
years.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no.
what
i
am
asking
you
to
do
is
to
affirm
the
state
trial
court's
finding
of
the
facts
and
to
reverse
state
supreme
court's
reversing
the
trial
court's
finding.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
they
haven’t
reversed
on
factual
ground.
they
have
reversed
on
misunderstanding
of
the
law
and
i
think
i
can
show
it
to
you
very
soon.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
just
want
the
court
to
understand
that
we
are
not
proposing
something
that
it
is
detrimental
to
the
fish
in
that
area
or
that
has
to
do
with
conservation.
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
the
state
has
the
right
to
appropriate
the
fish
first
for
sports
fisherman
and
to
totally
exclude
the
traditional
indian
fishing
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no
i
am
not
because
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
set
up
a
standard
that
has
assured
that
every
year
since
then,
that
the
indian
fishing
will
also
be
prohibited
and
that
has
occurred
in
each
year
since
then
and
--
let
me
show
you
this
language.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
let
me
give
you
two.
i
think
i
can
answer
this
graphically
for
you.
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
were
the
15
to
18,000
fish
were
being
taken
per
year
by
sports
fisherman.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
steelheads,
steelheads,
i’m
talking
only
about
steelheads.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
steelhead.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about.
and
the
most
succinct
statements
in
the
opinion
of
the
trail
court
says
in
view
of
the
large
number
of
steelhead
caught
in
the
puyallup
river,
it
would
seem
that
the
department
is
not
in
a
position
to
say
the
indians
can
be
entirely
excluded
from
the
exercise
of
any
special
right.
okay,
now,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
referred
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
sir?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
as
a
commercial
fishery
or
fishery
for
their
own?
yes,
such
as
commercial
fishery.
the
washington
supreme
court
reversed
that.
they
did
not
reverse
the
find.
they
did
not
argue
with
the
findings
that
13
to
18,000
fish
are
being
taken
each
year
by
sports
fisherman.
now
what
they
said
is,
the
catch
of
the
steelheads
for
fishery
alone
in
the
puyallup
river
leaves
no
more
than
a
sufficient
number
of
steelhead
for
escapement
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
the
steelhead
fishery
in
the
river.
and
so,
they
reversed
the
lower
court,
upheld
with
prohibition
for
fishing
for
steelheads
with
net
and
said
that
until
that
each
year
this
should
be
reviewed
and
when
there
are
enough
left
over
after
the
sport
fisherman
are
through,
the
indians
can
come
in
and
if
the
department
of
games
says
that
there
are
enough,
indians
can
fish
for
those.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
i
have
the
citation
to
it
in
my
brief.
it
is
at
page
573.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it
is
finding
--
it
is
point
number
four
page
573,
it
is
in
this
–
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
the
holding
in
the
case.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
washington
in
this
case,
but
the
supreme
court
clearly
established,
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
washington
clearly
established
a
priority
for
sports
fishermen
in
deciding
whether
an
indian
fishery
can
be
allowed
in
the
puyallup
river
and
they
have
established
that
priority
in
section
four
of
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
what
we
are
quarreling
about
and
we
are
also,
i
think
you
can
see
why
we
are
quarreling
about
it
because
the
department
of
game
of
the
state
of
washington
still
contests
the
right
of
the
indians
to
have
any
fishery
there
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
do
not
know
about
that.
the
evidence
doesn’t
show
one
way
or
another
as
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
the
court
found
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
my
real
argument
is
that
this
treaty
provided
the
indians
with
an
off
reservation
fishing
right
beyond
the
simple
fishing
of
other
people
in
the
state.
that
the
treaty
should
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
its
meaning
and
context,
which
was
that
these
people
would
be
able
to
some
extent
support
themselves
and
feed
themselves
from
these
fishing
rights.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
right,
that
they
can’t
take
the
entire
harvestable
fishery
here
and
devote
it
entirely
to
a
sports
fishery
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
(voice
overlap)
who
fish
here?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
at
all.
i
wish
to
point
out
also
that
the
federal
government
has
a
large
fishery
development
program
in
connection
with
indians
and
indian
reservations
and
then
just
in
general
and
that
the
federal
government
also
plants
fish
in
the
rivers.
though
not
in
the
puyallup
and
if
the
state
wanted
to
stop
planting
the
fish
in
the
puyallup,
the
federal
government
very
likely
would
stop
planting
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
to
this
extent
that
it
makes
the
larger
run,
it
makes
the
larger
harvestable
amount
and
to
take
that
harvest
full
amount
and
give
a
preference
to
sports
fisherman
for
that
harvest
amount
in
an
area
where
the
indians
have
traditionally
fished
and
where
they
relied
on
fishing;
part
of
their
life
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
not
--
there
is
nothing
in
--
as
to
second
part,
desire
to
conduct,
there
is
evidence
as
to
a
few
years
when
the
indian
owned
salmon.
when
the
indians
had
a
large
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
size
of
commercial
fishery
on
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
as
far
as
i
know
they
fished
steelhead
mainly
for
their
own
sustenance
and
there
is
no
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no
i
cannot
say
that
because
there
are
on
the
--
when
all
of
the
reservation
grants
since
there
is
a
commercial
steelhead
fishery
and
sports
fishery,
they
are
conducted
together
by
the
trial
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
let
me
say
this
that
the
indians
traditional
and
to
this
day
do
not
make
much
of
a
distinction
between
steelhead
and
salmon.
there
is
steelhead
and
salmon
guarderia,
it
is
salmony
guarderia,
the
big
fish
like
salmon
and
the
fish
the
same
way,
and
there
are
commercial
markets
for
steelhead
too.
but
there
is
no
solid
evidence
as
to
what
the
indians
would
want
if
for
instance,
they
were
allowed
to
fish
legally
for
these
fish.
now,
i
actually
say
this.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
determine
how
many
fish
the
indians
should
get
or
how
many
fish
the
sports
fisherman
should
get.
there
is
another
case
underway.
the
district
court,
the
federal
district
court
in
the
state
of
washington
call
it
united
states
versus
washington
where
the
attempt
is
somehow
to
quantify
the
fishing
rights
of
the
indians.
it
deals
primarily
with
salmon,
but
it
also
can
deal
with
the
steelhead
issue
and
there
is
a
very
big
record
there.
but
what
does
seem
to
clear
to
us
is
that
in
19
--
for
the
1970
regulation,
for
every
regulation
since
then
based
on
this
conclusion
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
that
the
sports
fisherman
have
to
come
first.
that
the
indians
are
being
deprived
of
their
share
of
the
fishing
for
steelhead
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
claim
a
discrimination
against
their
treaty
rights.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
a
denial
of
their
treaty
rights.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
there
is
a
discrimination
too.
i
do
claim
it
and
i
want
to
make
this
clear
that
the
indians
fish
in
the
rivers
and
there’s
--
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
the
record
on
this,
part
of
the
reason
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
money
to
go
out
and
fish
deep-sea
fishing
and
the
state
has
evidence
that
its
costs
$122.00
per
fish
to
catch
a
steelhead
as
a
sports
fish.
i
mean,
they
do
not
have
that
kind
of
money
and
they
have
always
fished
near
where
they
lived
in
the
river
where
they
can
fish
on
rather
occasional
basis
often
after
they
come
back
from
whatever
--
what
other
job
they
might
have
and
it
is
a
discrimination
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it's
like
this.
if
all
the
black
people
lived
in
a
particular
neighborhood
and
the
white
people
lived
in
a
different
neighborhood
and
the
court
said
in
this
black
neighborhood
nobody
can
work
in
his
yard.
in
this
neighborhood,
nobody
can
work,
nobody
can
have
a
business
and
the
other
neighborhood
you
can.
i
think
you
could
find
there
is
a
discrimination
there.
that
the
fishing
has
been
prohibited
in
the
place
where
the
indians
fish
and
it
is
deliberate,
it
is
deliberate.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
it
is
the
manner
of
fishing
that
this
indians
used
to
fish,
and
there
is
no
showing
that
it's
necessary
for
conservation
to
prohibit
that.
it
can
be
regulated
and
handled
very
well,
it
is
being
handled
on
indian
reservations
and
on
this
river
with
salmons.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
correct,
two
petitions.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
exactly
correct.
and
we
also
say
that
the
remedy
