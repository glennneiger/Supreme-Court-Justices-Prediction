justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
in
the
present
case
we
have
the
particular
words
of
a
particular
treaty,
don’t
we
general
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
of
taking
fish
in
all
usual
and
accustomed
grounds
or
stations
as
part
of
this
--
the
said
indians
in
common
with
to
all
citizens
of
the
territory.
our
concern
in
this
case
is
to
try
to
ascertain
the
meaning
of
those
particular
words
and
that
particular
treaty
rather
than
be
guided
by
the
general
kind
of
rules
to
which
you
have
been
referring
us?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that’s
not
the
type
of
language.
it
is
really
the
particular
words
of
a
particular
treaty
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
how
the
catch
is
going
to
be
divided
really?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
involves,
as
i
understand
it
at
least,
only
steelhead,
it
does
not
involve
salmon.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
this
issue,
i
thought
all
of
us
before
us
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
issue
could
arise
with
respect
to
any
kind
of
a
fish
but
i
thought
that
in
fact
in
this
case,
what
the
issue
was,
was
your
state
court's
treatment
of
the
steelhead.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be,
i
am
mistaken,
i
am
mistaken.
that
is
the
impression
i
got.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
real
reason
before
you
came
here
to
argue.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
where
can
find
the
opinion
of
your
state
court?
justice
potter
stewart
it
say
your
petition?
justice
potter
stewart
september
2otht.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
appendix
a
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
which
they
caught
with
nets?
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
supreme
court
have
done
that
we
affirm,
this
court
affirms?
justice
potter
stewart
we
did
not
remand
it
to
the
state
supreme
court,
we
affirmed
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
for
salmon
and
that
is
not
before
here?
justice
potter
stewart
the
department
of
fisheries
changed
its
mind?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
least
for
salmon.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
population,
the
size
of
population
might
be
quite
different
in
any
other
stream?
justice
potter
stewart
between
the
two
species?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
are
talking
about
steelhead,
are
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
exclusively,
are
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
so.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
that
is
what
you
are
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
do
you
find
that
language?
i
am
looking
at
the
petition
for
certiorari
of
the
department
of
game,
filed
september
21,
the
appendix.
is
it
around
page
five?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
573,
well
this
is
the
same
patronation
here.
page
573
a?
well,
that
is
not
where
it
is,
i
think
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
it
now.
but
the
holding
was,
wasn’t
it
and
only
as
justice
white
has
suggested
back
on
page
571
under
finding
four,
second
paragraph.
we
are
satisfied
from
the
record
in
the
present
case,
however
that
a
regulation
authorizing
an
indian
net
fishery
for
steelhead
for
the
year
1970
in
the
puyallup
river
would
have
been
destructive
to
the
conservation
of
this
steelhead
fishery.
and
the
department
of
games
contention
that
there
should
be
no
commercial
fishery
in
the
puyallup
river
for
steelhead
should
be
sustained
as
for
that
year.
that
is
the
holding
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you
think,
it’s
all
and
it’s
all
there,
that
is
what
you
are
quarreling
about?
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
matter
of
fact,
as
a
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
treaty
makes
it
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
cut
down
the
volume
of
sport
fishery.
justice
potter
stewart
so
long
as
the
fact
remains
as
they
are,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
say
there’s
not
enough
left
over
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
treaty
rights,
denial
of
their
treaty
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i?
see
if
i
understand
basically
what
this.
this
is
a
petition
and
a
cross
petition.
these
are
cause
petitions,
aren’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
brothers
in
the
other
side
i
gather
say
that
the,
you
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong
because
i
am
far
from
sure
that
i
do
understand
this
that,
but
the
game
commission
of
the
state
of
washington
says
that
the
washington
supreme
court
was
department
of
game
of
the
state
of
washington
says
that
the
washington
supreme
court
was
just
wrong
in
basic
principle
and
that
judge
hayle
is
dissenting
opinion
was
basically
correct.
would
you
understand
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say,
you
say
on
the
other
hand
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
was
basically
correct,
but
that
they
erred
in
giving
sole
priority
to
game
fishing
and
in
their
approach
that
if
and
only
if
they
were
enough
left
over
after
the
game
fisherman
got
all
the
fish
they
wanted,
only
then
could
the
indians
do
any
commercial
fishing
and
that
was
wrong,
that
was
the
only
thing
that
was
wrong
about
that
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
but
their
only
holding
was
with
respect
to
1970,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
said
they
applied
the
wrong
test
(voice
overlap)
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
your
own
state
supreme
court
didn’t
feel
bound
by
that,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
you
are
saying
it
is
the
law
that
the
steelhead
maybe
only
taken
by
line,
that
is
not
a
fact,
that
is
a
law?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
judge
hayle's
dissenting
opinion
was
correct,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
steelhead?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
succeeded
in
carrying
that
burden
every
year
beginning
1970?
justice
potter
stewart
of

in

we
