rehnquist
mr.
coniff,
was
your
answer
to
justice
stewart
and
justice
white’s
question
in
the
context
of
off
reservation
fishing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sachse,
as
i
read
puyallup
i
thought
at
least
on
page
398,
it
says
that
the
manner
maybe
regulated
in
the
interest
of
conservation.
it
doesn’t
say
that
it
has
to
be
necessary
for
a
conservation.
do
you
find
other
language
in
the
case
that
supports
your
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
weigh
a
statement
in
the
opinion
itself
if
it
seemed
to
conflict
with
the
statement
on
the
footnote?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sachse,
are
you
asking
us
to
make
a
review
of
state
court's
findings
on
facts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
test
do
we
apply
here
when
the
supreme
court
of
washington
has
reversed
on
a
factual
ground
the
superior
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it’s
a
misunderstanding
of
the
law,
why
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
get
into
all
the
testimony
below
as
to
whether,
you
know,
the
milling
and
that
sort
of
thing
if
it
is
strictly
a
point
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
claim
any
discrimination
against
the
indians
here,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
denial
of
their
treaty
rights
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
as
if
the
state
of
washington
were
saying
to
a
white
man
that
you
can
fish
commercially,
but
the
indians
can't.
the
regulation
applies
across
the
boarder.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
just
the
place,
it
is
a
manner
of
fishing
that
has
been
prohibited,
isn’t
it?
