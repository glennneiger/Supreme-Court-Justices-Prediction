these
cases
were
here
before
us
involved
the
construction
of
the
treaty
with
the
indian,
with
the
puyallup
tribe
which
we
held
previously,
in
the
prior
decision,
covered
commercial
fishing
by
nets
and
we
remanded
the
case
or
the
cases
that
were
here
before
for
reconsideration
by
the
washington
supreme
court,
reconciling
the
treaty
right
to
fish
by
nets
in
the
right
to
fish
by
hook
and
line
with
the
conservation
standards
that
are
--
we
emphasized
exists
in
the
cases
that
were
here
before.
on
the
remand,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
on
consideration
of
conversation
issue,
restricted
all
steelhead
fishing
in
this
particular
river,
the
puyallup
river
to
fishing
by
hook
and
line.
we
hold
that,
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
treaty
rights
of
the
indians.
the
commercial
fishing
by
nets
raises
considerable
problems
in
connection
with
the
conservation
problems
that
we
must
remand
the
case
we
feel
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
washington
so
that
some
equitable
solution
consistent
with
the
treaty
rights
can
be
worked
out.
our
views
our
elaborated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
white
has,
while
concurring
in
the
opinion,
has
filed
a
separate

which
the
chief
