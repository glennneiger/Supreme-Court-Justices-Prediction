justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
you’re
trying
to
show
is
that
it’s
just
as
if
he
applied
to
the
county
hospital
and
then
turned
down?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
all
these
questions
were
dressed
up
as
a
question
of
state
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
schroeder,
could
maricopa
county
impose
a
simple
residence
or
domicile
requirement
so
as
to
exclude
a
transient
from
coming
at
the
maricopa
county
hospital
and
getting
non-emergency
medical
care,
say
for
pre-existing
hernia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
theory
of
the
law,
on
which
side
would
that
fall?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
do
you
distinguish
starns
against
malkerson,
a
minnesota
resident
tuition
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
in
starns,
they
required
a
one
year
residency
requirement
before
you
could
get
non
--
before
you
get
resident
tuition
at
minnesota.
and
i
think
in
vlandis
last
year,
majority
of
the
court
approved
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
schroeder,
i
take
it
from
what
you
just
say
that
if
the
state
is
not
completely
disabled
from
burdening
the
right
to
travel,
but
it
depends
largely
on
what
interest
it
advances
for
doing
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
--
and
the
nature
of
your
argument
then
is
based
on
travel
rights
stated
in
shapiro
and
it
isn’t
an
equal
protection
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
chief
justice’s
hypothesis,
mrs.
schroeder,
i
take
it
that
perhaps
one
might
assume
if
the
man
lived
in
toronto,
that
he
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
it
make
any
difference
for
the
man’s
constitutional
rights?
your
client
came
from
new
mexico,
so
clearly
he
has
the
right
to
travel,
but
does
that
same
right
extend
to
people
who
are
not
citizens
and
simply
come
from
canada?
