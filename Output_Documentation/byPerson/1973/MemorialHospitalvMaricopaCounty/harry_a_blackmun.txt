justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
schroeder,
i
suppose
what
you’re
saying
there
is
that
if
the
county
can't
take
this
indigent
patient
on,
then
the
private,
not
for
profit
hospital
has
to
because
he’s
not
going
to
be
denied
health
care?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
a
county
measure.
now
suppose,
mr.
evaro
had
come
in
to
maricopa
county
from
the
adjoining
county
and
this
happened,
would
he
be
eligible
to
go
to
the
county
health
facility
back
in
the
other
county,
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
has
to
be
a
resident.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
just
ask
one
more
question
about
memorial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
in
fact
he
had
been
taken
in,
the
expense
of
his
care
would
not
have
been
born
by
the
county,
would
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
could
we
translate
that
into
a
medical
arena.
suppose
arizona
authorizes
its
county
hospitals
to
charge
“x”
dollars
to
a
nonresident,
an
“x”
minus
“y”
dollars
to
a
resident,
in
other
words,
a
discount
to
a
resident.
on
your
theory,
would
this
be
alright?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
do
you
think
it
was
a
matter
of
distinction
or
of
emphasis?
i
come
back
to
my
hypothetical
and
all
you
say
is
compelling
interest.
i’ve
never
know
quite
what
that
means
because
i
grope
for
a
case
where
we
have
upheld
a
statute
in
the
face
of
compelling
interest
standard.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
are
you
saying
that
carcinoma
is
necessarily
always
an
emergency
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then,
are
you
saying
that
carcinoma
is
always
a
nonemergency
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
normally,
that
would
be
a
medical
determination,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
mr.
--
going
back
to
my
hypothetical.
if
mr.
evaro
were
a
resident
of
a
state
outside
arizona,
and
were
down
there
for
a
vacation,
would
you
be
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
wouldn’t
at
all.
you
would
say
that
the
state
could
draw
the
distinction
between
a
resident
and
a
nonresident
so
far
as
its
facilities
are
concerned?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
then
you
client
is
willing
to
take
on
these
out
of
state
indigents
without
complain?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
doesn’t
that
also
impinge
upon
the
right
to
travel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
however
conceding
that
the
applicable
standard
is
that
of
the
compelling
state
interest?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
might
have
enough
time
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
carter,
the
--
am
i
correct,
however,
into
saying
that
the
practical
result
of
your
position
is
that
the
care
of
mr.
evaro
and
others
like
him
is
placed
upon
the
private
nonprofit
facility?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
does
mean
that
the
maricopa
--
that
the
memorial
hospital
has
to
take
care
of
mr.
evaro
free
of
charge?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
does
this
not
been
have
a
destructive
effect
upon
the
financial
integrity
of
these
institutions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
let
me
follow
through,
they
would
also
have
to
take
all
the
indigents
in
arizona
that
are
not
residents
of
arizona,
the
private
hospital
would?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
isn’t
it
better
for
the
municipal
facility
to
do
this
than
for
the
private
facility
in
which
has
other
indigent
claims
upon
them,
if
it’s
worth
its
salt?
justice
harry
a.
