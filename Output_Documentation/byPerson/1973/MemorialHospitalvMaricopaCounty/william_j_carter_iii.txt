mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
maricopa
county
which
is
a
territorial
subdivision
of
the
state
of
arizona
that
includes
the
city
of
phoenix
and
roughly
half
the
population
of
the
state.
i
would
--
this
would
be
relevant
as
i
get
into
my
argument.
the
county
maintains
a
large
modern
hospital,
approximately
500
beds
and
large
out-patient
clinic
department
because
it
has
a
statutory
duty
to
provide
medical
care
for
the
indigent
who
resides
in
the
county.
the
issue
before
this
court
which
i
agree
with
mrs.
schroeder
is
simply
whether
or
not
a
12-month
durational
residence
requirement
for
eligibility
for
medical
care
at
county
expense
violates
the
united
states
constitution.
i
think
it’s
a
relatively
simple
issue.
it
breaks
down
into
two
components.
one,
does
this
residency
requirement
in
any
way
penalizes
the
right
of
interstate
travel
and
two,
if
so,
is
there
a
compelling
state
interest
to
be
protected
by
imposing
that
penalty?
taking
the
last
first,
i
will
state
to
the
court
as
candidly
as
i
can
that
the
interest
which
i
suggest
is
compelling
is
money.
we
estimated
in
our
brief
that
the
cost
of
providing
medical
care
to
indigent
residents,
who
have
not
lived
in
this
county
for
one
year,
would
be
approximately
13%
of
the
budget
that
sums
for
medical
care.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
is
necessary
because
as
i
read
shapiro,
you
said
that
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
imposition
of
a
penalty.
and
you
went
on
to
say
that
for
the
purpose
of
general
welfare
that
fiscal
convenience
or
some
word
to
that
effect
was
not
compelling.
in
shapiro,
you
were
dealing
a
life
or
death
matter.
if
a
person
does
not
receive
food,
clothing
and
shelter,
he
will
die.
we’re
not
dealing
with
that
in
this
case.
i
would
agree
that
the
state
may
not
withhold
emergency
medical
care
on
the
basis
of
a
durational
residence
requirement
for
that
very
reason.
if
we
attempted
to
do
that,
we
do
indeed
be
conflicting
with
your
holding
in
shapiro.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
no,
your
honor.
i’m
not.
my
argument
is
alternative.
first,
that
there
is
no
penalty
and
second,
that
if
there
is,
the
interest
is
compelling.
my
primary
argument
is
that
there
is
and
that
this
residence
requirement
does
not
constitute
a
penalty.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
yes.
that
the
--
whether
or
not
--
the
test
to
be
employed
first
is
whether
or
not
the
durational
residence
requirement
constitutes
a
penalty
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
interstate
travel.
i
think
that
this
is
a
test
that
you
set
forth
in
dunn
against
blumstein.
and
it
has
to
be
examined
from
that
point
of
view.
if
you
take
the
major
durational
residence
requirements
which
have
been
struck
down
by
this
court,
all
of
those
cases
can
be
reconciled
with
starns
against
malkerson
in
which
you
upheld
a
durational
residence
requirement
or
university
tuition,
and
with
this
case.
in
the
shapiro
case,
the
person
involved
was
threatened
with
a
denial
of
an
absolute
necessity
of
life.
if
you
do
not
receive
clothing,
if
you
don’t
receive
food,
even
in
arizona
if
you
don’t
receive
shelter,
you’re
very
likely
to
die.
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
statute
that’s
involved
here.
if
you
do
find
yourself
with
a
medical
condition,
that
puts
you
in
that
situation,
then
you
are
entitled
to
receive
medical
care
at
public
expense,
provided
you’re
a
resident
regardless
of
the
term
non-residence.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
time
that
the
brief
was
filed,
we
calculated
that
the
cost
of
furnishing
non-emergency
medical
care
to
residents
of
the
state
who
were
indigent
but
had
not
resided
in
the
state
for
one
year
would
be
13%
of
the
amounts
presently
budgeted
for
furnishing
medical
care
to
the
indigents
who
have
lived
in
the
state
for
one
year.
since
that
time,
our
estimates
have
been
revised
and
it
is
now
closer
to
10%.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
know
whether
they’re
larger
or
smaller
but
i
think
that
the
standard
against
which
they
have
to
be
measured
is
different.
in
rivera
against
dunn,
you
upheld
a
decision
which
struck
down
a
new,
a
durational
residence
requirement
for
general
welfare
because
in
the
dunn
case,
the
only
justification
offered
was
the
cost,
but
the
durational
residence
requirement
has
to
be
--
the
penalty
has
to
be
measured
if
any,
must
be
measured
against
the
benefit
to
be
derived.
i
would
not,
for
example,
--
well,
in
maricopa
county,
we’re
talking
about
roughly
$2.5
million
a
year
at
present
rates
of
inflation
and
growth,
i
would
not,
for
example,
argue
that
this
is
a
compelling
state
reason
to
cease
private
property
without
due
process
of
law
or
abolish
the
courts
to
save
the
expense
of
affording
due
process
before
you
incarcerate
a
person
who
has
committed
a
crime.
i
think
that
the
penalty,
if
any,
must
be
weighed
against
--
that
the
interest
to
be
protected
must
be
weighed
against
the
advantage.
and
here,
i’m
offering
for
your
consideration
that
$2.5
million
does
as
a
consideration
outweigh
the
interest
in
non-emergency
medical
care
and
not
offering
money
as
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
what
is
an
emergency
and
what
isn’t
is
defined
in
the
statute
as
a
condition
threatening
life
or
limb,
but
in
practical
application,
an
emergency
is
whatever
the
doctor
at
the
emergency
receiving
room
wants
to
call
it.
we
operate,
the
only
way
that
i
know
of
to
determine
whether
any
medical
condition
is
an
emergency
is
to
have
the
person
examined
by
a
doctor.
and
for
that
reason
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
operate
as
a
part
of
the
hospital
an
emergency
receiving
room
which
is
open
without
question
to
anybody
who
comes
in,
regardless
of
any
condition
of
residence
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
the
doctor
is
an
employee
of
the
hospital
and
therefore
the
hospital
on
simple
theory
of
agency
would
be
bound
by
his
decision.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
the
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
oh,no,
your
honor.
we
would
not
be
bound
by
the
determination
of
a
private
physician.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
our
own
doctors
would,
that’s
correct,
who
are
hospital
employees.
the
normal
route
for
requesting
admission
would
be
the
emergency
room
and
if
the
doctor
there
thought
that
the
patient
had
a
life
threatening
condition,
he
would
be
admitted.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
well,
i
[attempt
to
laughter]
understand
what
you
say.
there’s
no
question
that
early
medical
treatment,
non-emergency
medical
treatment
is
a
benefit
and
i’m
sure
there’s
no
question
that
there
are
gray
areas
where
you
can
pin
someone
down
especially
a
person
like
me
without
any
medical
background.
but
the
principle
that
i’m
asserting
is
that
if
the
condition
is
life
threatening,
then
it
is
of
necessity
and
emergency
and
the
method
of
evaluating
that
condition
is
an
emergency
room
with
a
doctor
in
charge
who
would
rather
let,
keep
people
alive
than
let
them
die.
so,
it
is
much
less
inhumane
than
has
been
suggested.
there’s
been
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
case
of
vaughan
against
bower
in
which
this
court
upheld
a
decision
striking
down
a
durational
residence
requirement
for
treatment
at
the
arizona
state
hospital.
but
that
statute
contains
another
provision
which
was
such
a
flagrant
invasion
of
the
right
of
interstate
travel
that
the
case
striking
it
down
is
not
really
applicable
in
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
whether
the
exact
three
judges
were
the
same,
but
i
agree
that
valenciano
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
agree
that
valenciano
is
directly
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
court
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
would
still
offer
to
the
court
the
fact
that
in
the
vaughan
case,
the
statute
empowered
the
superintendent
of
the
state
hospital
to
take
the
recently
arrived
patient
in
his
hospital
and
put
him
or
her
on
a
public
conveyance
back
to
the
state
that
he
came
from.
this
is
a
float.
it
is
a
forcible
expulsion
of
a
person
from
the
state
who
has
recently
arrived
and
it
puts
the
entire
statute
in
a
completely
different
situation.
i
wouldn’t
for
a
moment
argue
that
maricopa
county
can
expel
anyone.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
well,
they
put
him
on
a
railroad
train
and
ship
him
out
of
town.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
it
is
a
direct,
physical
invasion
of
this
individual
autonomy.
there’s
no
statistical
evidence
that
the
durational
residence
requirement
in
this
case
has
deterred
anyone.
in
fact,
all
of
the
statistical
evidence
would
tend
to
suggest
that
there
has
been
no
deterrence
because
arizona
has
enjoyed
or
suffered
an
extraordinarily
high
rate
of
growth
rolled
up
to
other
states
in
the
union.
so,
it’s
necessary
in
looking
at
this
to
speak
conjecturally
to
examine
the
statute
and
conjecture
whether
or
not
it
does
constitute
a
penalty
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
interstate
travel.
and
i
would
suggest
then
the
penalty,
if
any,
that
it
imposes
is
identical,
or
of
like
degree
to
the
one
that
the
court
upheld
in
starns
and
spoke
more
specifically
of
in
vlandis
against
kline.
if
you
intend
to
live
in
a
state
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
no,
there
is
none
whatsoever.
in
starns,
there
were
several
reasons
advanced.
one
of
them
was
a
difficulty
of
ascertaining
the
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
bona
fides
of
the
residents
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
--
but
another
one
offered
and
the
one
that
i
would
offer
in
this
case
is
simply
a
determination
that
in
this
rather
more
limited
benefit,
the
state
could
reasonably
decide
to
extend
it
to
those
who
have
already
contributed
to
the
economy
of
the
state
by
paying
taxes
and
living
there.
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
indigents
are
taxpayers.
so,
an
indigent
who
has
lived
in
the
state
for
one
year
of
necessity
both
indirectly
and
directly
has
contributed
a
substantial
amount
to
tax
revenues
of
the
state.
the
argument
offered
in
starns
was
that
with
this
rather
limited
benefit,
not
a
life-threatening
or
life-giving
benefit
that
it
could
be
extended
only
that
the
legislature
could
reasonably
decide
to
extend
it
only
to
those
who
had
made
a
contribution
of
some
kind
by
their
presence
and
activity
to
the
state.
there
is
no
question
that
a
one
year
durational
residence
requirement
is
valuable
in
determining
bona
fides
of
residence.
i
hesitate
to
offer
to
this
court
because
you
didn’t
think
much
of
it
in
shapiro
or
dunn
but
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
valuable.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
as
i
read
shapiro,
the
state
is
entitled
to
find
out
whether
they
are
or
may
be
entitled
to
find
out
whether
a
person
is
in
fact
a
resident.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
but
it
may
not
impose
a
durational
residence
requirement
which
could
threaten
his
existence
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
as
a
means.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
am
not
offering
because
of
shapiro
and
because
of
dunn,
i
am
not
offering
the
convenience
of
ascertaining
residence
as
a
justification
for
the
statute
in
this
case.
i
recognize
that
the
court
has
already
taken
care
of
that
argument
for
me.
a
proponent
of
the
justification
that
i
did
offer,
i’d
like
to
describe
to
the
court
what
the
financing
of
the
county
hospital
is.
it’s
financed
principally,
approximately
90%
by
ad
valorem
taxes,
ad
valorem
property
taxes.
there
are
other
financing
devices,
but
they’re
minor.
the
ad
valorem
property
taxes
that
finance
it
are
imposed
strictly
on
property
within
the
jurisdiction
that
supports
the
hospital.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
get
a
great
deal
of
federal
money
for
our
health
services
department
but
most
of
it
is
earmarked
for
specialized
programs
which
do
not
have
a
durational
residence
requirement.
i’m
referring
to
programs
like
tuberculosis
control,
vd,
things
like
that.
that’s
the
essence
of
my
argument
that
if
the
court
matches
starns
against
shapiro
that
it’s
going
to
have
to
find
some
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
two
because
on
the
one
hand,
you
struck
down
a
durational
residence
requirement
as
a
condition
of
receiving
a
benefit
which
the
state
extended
to
its
citizens
and
in
the
other
you
upheld
it.
i
think
if
you
examine
those
cases,
that
the
only
distinction
which
can
be
made
between
the
two
is
that
in
the
case
of
shapiro
and
in
the
other
cases
like
dunn
that
there
was
either
a
life-threatening
condition,
or
a
an
invasion
of
a
fundamental
right
of
citizenship
such
as
voting
or
--
here
there
is
none.
the
condition
is
not
life-threatening
and
there
is
no
invasion
of
a
fundamental
right
of
citizenship,
therefore,
it
very
closely
resembles
the
durational
residence
requirement
in
starns.
i’m
not
for
a
moment
going
to
suggest
that
this
benefit
which
is
withheld
is
of
little
value,
but
the
same
is
true
of
reduced
tuition.
it’s
an
extremely
valuable
benefit,
but
it
is
not
a
life
giving
benefit.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
the
practical
result
of
my
position
is
hard
to
measure,
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
it
varies
with
the
facility
that
a
particular
county
has.
in
maricopa
county
hospital,
roughly
40%
of
our
patients
are
legally
indigent,
approximately
an
equal
number
are
not
legally
indigent,
however,
they
are
so
poor
that
they
cannot
pay
their
hospital
bills.
so,
we
go
through
the
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
evaro
could’ve
been
admitted
to
the
hospital
but
he
would
have
got
a
bill.
he
would
have
been
admitted
in
the
capacity
of
indigent.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
it
does
mean
that
there
are
some
cases
where
the
voluntary
hospitals
are
extending
care
to
people
who
would
not,
who
would
be
eligible,
but
for
the
durational
residence
requirement.
yes,
sir.
it
does
mean
that.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
to
the
extent
that
this
occurs,
it
causes
the
cost
of
that
to
be
passed
on
to
the
private
patient.
i
would
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
well,
they’re
required.
most
of
them
have
received
the
substantial
amount
of
hill-burton
funds,
federal
funds
for
their
construction
which
requires
that
they
do
some
indigent
work.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
county
hospital
rather
than
the
voluntary
hospital
in
maricopa
county
takes
the
bulk
of
the
people
who
are
ineligible
but
can’t
pay.
they
are
almost
half
our
hospital
population.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
you’re
sick
and
broke,
somebody’s
got
to
take
care
of
you
and
in
phoenix,
it’s
the
county
hospital
that
usually
does.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
agree
and
in
practice,
this
is
what
occurs.
we
have
an
awful
lot
of
un-collectible
bills.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
maricopa
county
which
is
a
territorial
subdivision
of
the
state
of
arizona
that
includes
the
city
of
phoenix
and
roughly
half
the
population
of
the
state.
i
would
--
this
would
be
relevant
as
i
get
into
my
argument.
the
county
maintains
a
large
modern
hospital,
approximately
500
beds
and
large
out-patient
clinic
department
because
it
has
a
statutory
duty
to
provide
medical
care
for
the
indigent
who
resides
in
the
county.
the
issue
before
this
court
which
i
agree
with
mrs.
schroeder
is
simply
whether
or
not
a
12-month
durational
residence
requirement
for
eligibility
for
medical
care
at
county
expense
violates
the
united
states
constitution.
i
think
it’s
a
relatively
simple
issue.
it
breaks
down
into
two
components.
one,
does
this
residency
requirement
in
any
way
penalizes
the
right
of
interstate
travel
and
two,
if
so,
is
there
a
compelling
state
interest
to
be
protected
by
imposing
that
penalty?
taking
the
last
first,
i
will
state
to
the
court
as
candidly
as
i
can
that
the
interest
which
i
suggest
is
compelling
is
money.
we
estimated
in
our
brief
that
the
cost
of
providing
medical
care
to
indigent
residents,
who
have
not
lived
in
this
county
for
one
year,
would
be
approximately
13%
of
the
budget
that
sums
for
medical
care.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
is
necessary
because
as
i
read
shapiro,
you
said
that
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
imposition
of
a
penalty.
and
you
went
on
to
say
that
for
the
purpose
of
general
welfare
that
fiscal
convenience
or
some
word
to
that
effect
was
not
compelling.
in
shapiro,
you
were
dealing
a
life
or
death
matter.
if
a
person
does
not
receive
food,
clothing
and
shelter,
he
will
die.
we’re
not
dealing
with
that
in
this
case.
i
would
agree
that
the
state
may
not
withhold
emergency
medical
care
on
the
basis
of
a
durational
residence
requirement
for
that
very
reason.
if
we
attempted
to
do
that,
we
do
indeed
be
conflicting
with
your
holding
in
shapiro.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
no,
your
honor.
i’m
not.
my
argument
is
alternative.
first,
that
there
is
no
penalty
and
second,
that
if
there
is,
the
interest
is
compelling.
my
primary
argument
is
that
there
is
and
that
this
residence
requirement
does
not
constitute
a
penalty.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
yes.
that
the
--
whether
or
not
--
the
test
to
be
employed
first
is
whether
or
not
the
durational
residence
requirement
constitutes
a
penalty
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
interstate
travel.
i
think
that
this
is
a
test
that
you
set
forth
in
dunn
against
blumstein.
and
it
has
to
be
examined
from
that
point
of
view.
if
you
take
the
major
durational
residence
requirements
which
have
been
struck
down
by
this
court,
all
of
those
cases
can
be
reconciled
with
starns
against
malkerson
in
which
you
upheld
a
durational
residence
requirement
or
university
tuition,
and
with
this
case.
in
the
shapiro
case,
the
person
involved
was
threatened
with
a
denial
of
an
absolute
necessity
of
life.
if
you
do
not
receive
clothing,
if
you
don’t
receive
food,
even
in
arizona
if
you
don’t
receive
shelter,
you’re
very
likely
to
die.
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
statute
that’s
involved
here.
if
you
do
find
yourself
with
a
medical
condition,
that
puts
you
in
that
situation,
then
you
are
entitled
to
receive
medical
care
at
public
expense,
provided
you’re
a
resident
regardless
of
the
term
non-residence.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
time
that
the
brief
was
filed,
we
calculated
that
the
cost
of
furnishing
non-emergency
medical
care
to
residents
of
the
state
who
were
indigent
but
had
not
resided
in
the
state
for
one
year
would
be
13%
of
the
amounts
presently
budgeted
for
furnishing
medical
care
to
the
indigents
who
have
lived
in
the
state
for
one
year.
since
that
time,
our
estimates
have
been
revised
and
it
is
now
closer
to
10%.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
know
whether
they’re
larger
or
smaller
but
i
think
that
the
standard
against
which
they
have
to
be
measured
is
different.
in
rivera
against
dunn,
you
upheld
a
decision
which
struck
down
a
new,
a
durational
residence
requirement
for
general
welfare
because
in
the
dunn
case,
the
only
justification
offered
was
the
cost,
but
the
durational
residence
requirement
has
to
be
--
the
penalty
has
to
be
measured
if
any,
must
be
measured
against
the
benefit
to
be
derived.
i
would
not,
for
example,
--
well,
in
maricopa
county,
we’re
talking
about
roughly
$2.5
million
a
year
at
present
rates
of
inflation
and
growth,
i
would
not,
for
example,
argue
that
this
is
a
compelling
state
reason
to
cease
private
property
without
due
process
of
law
or
abolish
the
courts
to
save
the
expense
of
affording
due
process
before
you
incarcerate
a
person
who
has
committed
a
crime.
i
think
that
the
penalty,
if
any,
must
be
weighed
against
--
that
the
interest
to
be
protected
must
be
weighed
against
the
advantage.
and
here,
i’m
offering
for
your
consideration
that
$2.5
million
does
as
a
consideration
outweigh
the
interest
in
non-emergency
medical
care
and
not
offering
money
as
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
what
is
an
emergency
and
what
isn’t
is
defined
in
the
statute
as
a
condition
threatening
life
or
limb,
but
in
practical
application,
an
emergency
is
whatever
the
doctor
at
the
emergency
receiving
room
wants
to
call
it.
we
operate,
the
only
way
that
i
know
of
to
determine
whether
any
medical
condition
is
an
emergency
is
to
have
the
person
examined
by
a
doctor.
and
for
that
reason
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
operate
as
a
part
of
the
hospital
an
emergency
receiving
room
which
is
open
without
question
to
anybody
who
comes
in,
regardless
of
any
condition
of
residence
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
the
doctor
is
an
employee
of
the
hospital
and
therefore
the
hospital
on
simple
theory
of
agency
would
be
bound
by
his
decision.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
the
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
oh,no,
your
honor.
we
would
not
be
bound
by
the
determination
of
a
private
physician.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
our
own
doctors
would,
that’s
correct,
who
are
hospital
employees.
the
normal
route
for
requesting
admission
would
be
the
emergency
room
and
if
the
doctor
there
thought
that
the
patient
had
a
life
threatening
condition,
he
would
be
admitted.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
well,
i
[attempt
to
laughter]
understand
what
you
say.
there’s
no
question
that
early
medical
treatment,
non-emergency
medical
treatment
is
a
benefit
and
i’m
sure
there’s
no
question
that
there
are
gray
areas
where
you
can
pin
someone
down
especially
a
person
like
me
without
any
medical
background.
but
the
principle
that
i’m
asserting
is
that
if
the
condition
is
life
threatening,
then
it
is
of
necessity
and
emergency
and
the
method
of
evaluating
that
condition
is
an
emergency
room
with
a
doctor
in
charge
who
would
rather
let,
keep
people
alive
than
let
them
die.
so,
it
is
much
less
inhumane
than
has
been
suggested.
there’s
been
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
case
of
vaughan
against
bower
in
which
this
court
upheld
a
decision
striking
down
a
durational
residence
requirement
for
treatment
at
the
arizona
state
hospital.
but
that
statute
contains
another
provision
which
was
such
a
flagrant
invasion
of
the
right
of
interstate
travel
that
the
case
striking
it
down
is
not
really
applicable
in
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
white,
i
don’t
whether
the
exact
three
judges
were
the
same,
but
i
agree
that
valenciano
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
agree
that
valenciano
is
directly
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
court
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
would
still
offer
to
the
court
the
fact
that
in
the
vaughan
case,
the
statute
empowered
the
superintendent
of
the
state
hospital
to
take
the
recently
arrived
patient
in
his
hospital
and
put
him
or
her
on
a
public
conveyance
back
to
the
state
that
he
came
from.
this
is
a
float.
it
is
a
forcible
expulsion
of
a
person
from
the
state
who
has
recently
arrived
and
it
puts
the
entire
statute
in
a
completely
different
situation.
i
wouldn’t
for
a
moment
argue
that
maricopa
county
can
expel
anyone.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
well,
they
put
him
on
a
railroad
train
and
ship
him
out
of
town.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
it
is
a
direct,
physical
invasion
of
this
individual
autonomy.
there’s
no
statistical
evidence
that
the
durational
residence
requirement
in
this
case
has
deterred
anyone.
in
fact,
all
of
the
statistical
evidence
would
tend
to
suggest
that
there
has
been
no
deterrence
because
arizona
has
enjoyed
or
suffered
an
extraordinarily
high
rate
of
growth
rolled
up
to
other
states
in
the
union.
so,
it’s
necessary
in
looking
at
this
to
speak
conjecturally
to
examine
the
statute
and
conjecture
whether
or
not
it
does
constitute
a
penalty
on
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
interstate
travel.
and
i
would
suggest
then
the
penalty,
if
any,
that
it
imposes
is
identical,
or
of
like
degree
to
the
one
that
the
court
upheld
in
starns
and
spoke
more
specifically
of
in
vlandis
against
kline.
if
you
intend
to
live
in
a
state
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
no,
there
is
none
whatsoever.
in
starns,
there
were
several
reasons
advanced.
one
of
them
was
a
difficulty
of
ascertaining
the
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
bona
fides
of
the
residents
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
--
but
another
one
offered
and
the
one
that
i
would
offer
in
this
case
is
simply
a
determination
that
in
this
rather
more
limited
benefit,
the
state
could
reasonably
decide
to
extend
it
to
those
who
have
already
contributed
to
the
economy
of
the
state
by
paying
taxes
and
living
there.
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
indigents
are
taxpayers.
so,
an
indigent
who
has
lived
in
the
state
for
one
year
of
necessity
both
indirectly
and
directly
has
contributed
a
substantial
amount
to
tax
revenues
of
the
state.
the
argument
offered
in
starns
was
that
with
this
rather
limited
benefit,
not
a
life-threatening
or
life-giving
benefit
that
it
could
be
extended
only
that
the
legislature
could
reasonably
decide
to
extend
it
only
to
those
who
had
made
a
contribution
of
some
kind
by
their
presence
and
activity
to
the
state.
there
is
no
question
that
a
one
year
durational
residence
requirement
is
valuable
in
determining
bona
fides
of
residence.
i
hesitate
to
offer
to
this
court
because
you
didn’t
think
much
of
it
in
shapiro
or
dunn
but
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
valuable.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
as
i
read
shapiro,
the
state
is
entitled
to
find
out
whether
they
are
or
may
be
entitled
to
find
out
whether
a
person
is
in
fact
a
resident.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
but
it
may
not
impose
a
durational
residence
requirement
which
could
threaten
his
existence
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
as
a
means.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
am
not
offering
because
of
shapiro
and
because
of
dunn,
i
am
not
offering
the
convenience
of
ascertaining
residence
as
a
justification
for
the
statute
in
this
case.
i
recognize
that
the
court
has
already
taken
care
of
that
argument
for
me.
a
proponent
of
the
justification
that
i
did
offer,
i’d
like
to
describe
to
the
court
what
the
financing
of
the
county
hospital
is.
it’s
financed
principally,
approximately
90%
by
ad
valorem
taxes,
ad
valorem
property
taxes.
there
are
other
financing
devices,
but
they’re
minor.
the
ad
valorem
property
taxes
that
finance
it
are
imposed
strictly
on
property
within
the
jurisdiction
that
supports
the
hospital.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
get
a
great
deal
of
federal
money
for
our
health
services
department
but
most
of
it
is
earmarked
for
specialized
programs
which
do
not
have
a
durational
residence
requirement.
i’m
referring
to
programs
like
tuberculosis
control,
vd,
things
like
that.
that’s
the
essence
of
my
argument
that
if
the
court
matches
starns
against
shapiro
that
it’s
going
to
have
to
find
some
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
two
because
on
the
one
hand,
you
struck
down
a
durational
residence
requirement
as
a
condition
of
receiving
a
benefit
which
the
state
extended
to
its
citizens
and
in
the
other
you
upheld
it.
i
think
if
you
examine
those
cases,
that
the
only
distinction
which
can
be
made
between
the
two
is
that
in
the
case
of
shapiro
and
in
the
other
cases
like
dunn
that
there
was
either
a
life-threatening
condition,
or
a
an
invasion
of
a
fundamental
right
of
citizenship
such
as
voting
or
--
here
there
is
none.
the
condition
is
not
life-threatening
and
there
is
no
invasion
of
a
fundamental
right
of
citizenship,
therefore,
it
very
closely
resembles
the
durational
residence
requirement
in
starns.
i’m
not
for
a
moment
going
to
suggest
that
this
benefit
which
is
withheld
is
of
little
value,
but
the
same
is
true
of
reduced
tuition.
it’s
an
extremely
valuable
benefit,
but
it
is
not
a
life
giving
benefit.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
the
practical
result
of
my
position
is
hard
to
measure,
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
it
varies
with
the
facility
that
a
particular
county
has.
in
maricopa
county
hospital,
roughly
40%
of
our
patients
are
legally
indigent,
approximately
an
equal
number
are
not
legally
indigent,
however,
they
are
so
poor
that
they
cannot
pay
their
hospital
bills.
so,
we
go
through
the
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
mr.
evaro
could’ve
been
admitted
to
the
hospital
but
he
would
have
got
a
bill.
he
would
have
been
admitted
in
the
capacity
of
indigent.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
it
does
mean
that
there
are
some
cases
where
the
voluntary
hospitals
are
extending
care
to
people
who
would
not,
who
would
be
eligible,
but
for
the
durational
residence
requirement.
yes,
sir.
it
does
mean
that.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
to
the
extent
that
this
occurs,
it
causes
the
cost
of
that
to
be
passed
on
to
the
private
patient.
i
would
--
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
well,
they’re
required.
most
of
them
have
received
the
substantial
amount
of
hill-burton
funds,
federal
funds
for
their
construction
which
requires
that
they
do
some
indigent
work.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
county
hospital
rather
than
the
voluntary
hospital
in
maricopa
county
takes
the
bulk
of
the
people
who
are
ineligible
but
can’t
pay.
they
are
almost
half
our
hospital
population.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
you’re
sick
and
broke,
somebody’s
got
to
take
care
of
you
and
in
phoenix,
it’s
the
county
hospital
that
usually
does.
mr.
william
j.
carter,
iii
i
agree
and
in
practice,
this
is
what
