ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
you
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
the
issue
before
you
is
the
constitutionality
of
an
arizona
statute
that
denies
medical
care
at
public
expense
to
residents
who
have
not
been
residents
a
year.
this
court
presumably
has
taken
jurisdiction
of
this
case
because
the
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
that
requirement
was
in
direct
conflict
with
the
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
arizona
which
invalidated
the
identical
provision
as
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
an
infringement
on
their
right
to
travel.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
in
almost
is
direct
conflict
with
a
determination
of
this
court
in
affirming
a
district
court
decision
in
arizona
which
invalidated
a
similar
durational
residence
requirements
for
mental
health
care
in
arizona.
the
case
arises
here
because
in
1971,
a
man
named
henry
evaro
moved
from
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
that
state
of
arizona,
intending
to
make
arizona
his
home
and
his
residence.
about
six
weeks
after
he
moved
to
arizona,
he
became
very
seriously
ill
with
an
acute
respiratory
illness.
he
was
gasping
for
breath.
it’s
been
stipulated
below
he
clearly
required
medical
attention
to
restore
his
health.
he
went
to
his
private
doctor,
but
his
private
doctor
told
him,
he
needed
hospitalization
and
referred
him
to
a
private
hospital,
memorial
hospital,
the
appellant
here.
when
he
went
to
memorial
hospital,
the
hospital
determined
that
he
was
indigent
and
asked
under
their
appropriate
procedures,
the
county
hospital
either
take
mr.
evaro
as
a
patient,
give
him
treatment
there
or
that
the
county
reimburse
memorial
hospital
for
the
cost
which
it
would
expend
in
giving
mr.
evaro
treatment.
the
county
refused.
in
doing
so
it
acted
in
accordance
with
the
statute
which
says
that
“unless
there
is
an
emergency”
and
i
will
discuss
that
exception
in
a
few
moments
if
it
please
the
court,
mr.
evaro
was
clearly
not
in
emergency
case
even
though
he
needed
care
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
the
county
said
that
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
it
could
not
give
him
care
because
he
had
not
been
a
resident
for
a
year.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
and
i’m
here
representing
mr.
evaro
and
that
hospital
because
the
private
hospitals
in
arizona
have
a
very
real
concern
in
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
sir.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
is
the
county
hospital
operated
at
public
expense,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that’s
true.
out
of
decency,
the
private
hospitals
will
take
on
as
many
patients
as
they
can.
they
can't
handle
it
all,
but
they
take
on
what
they
can
and
when
they
do,
the
cost
had
to
be
born
somewhere
and
they
are
passed
on
to
paying
patients
at
the
time
when
it’s
particularly
difficult
for
them
to
bear
this
cost
as
well.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
your
honor.
this
is
a
state
statute
which
imposes
a
county
residence
requirement.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
he
has
to
be
a
resident
of
the
county,
so
that
it
bars
all
those
like
mr.
evaro
who
travel
from
one
state
to
another
as
well
as
those
who
move
within
the
state
of
arizona.
the
statute
itself
was
passed
in
the
1930’s
at
a
time
when
the
legislature
was
very
much
concerned
about
the
tremendous
movement
of
people
in
the
united
states,
particularly
coming
into
arizona.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
your
honor,
the
statute
does
provide
that
if
the
county
is
unable
to
provide
care
at
the
county
hospital,
that
it
can
reimburse
private
hospitals,
provided
that
they
meet
the
residence
requirement.
when
this
statute
was
passed,
there
was
a
concern
appended
to
our
brief
legislative
history
showing
that
these
durational
residence
requirements
were
passed
at
the
time
when
there
was
a
great
deal
of
movement
throughout
the
country,
particularly
in
arizona.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
it
could’ve
been
accepted
at
the
county
hospital
because
he
wasn’t
eligible
for
treatment
at
county
expense.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
what
happened
here,
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
because
he
did
not
meet
the
residence
requirement,
the
private
hospital
which
cared
for
him
was
not
entitled
to
reimbursement
by
the
county.
most
of
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
he
was
referred
to
the
private
hospital,
but
had
he
gone
to
the
county
hospital,
the
county
hospital
would’ve
told
him
that
unless
you
can
pay
your
bills,
you
can't
--
we
can't
treat
you
here
and
he
would
have
to
go
elsewhere.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
except
that
it
happened,
so
he
went
to
a
private
hospital
which
did
give
him
treatment
at
considerable
expense.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
but,
your
honor,
this
--
i
don’t
think
there
can
be
a
serious
question
here
with
the
statute
imposing
this
requirement
and
enforced
in
this
manner.
the
statute
was,
of
course,
passed
when
the
state
was
concerned
about
people
coming
in.
it
was
passed
at
the
same
time
with
durational
residence
requirements
for
public
assistance.
cash
welfare
benefits
were
passed.
it
was
in
the
same
period
that
california
enacted
its
absolute
bar
to
indigents
in
the
state
that
would
struck
down
a
generation
that
go
by
this
court
in
edwards
versus
california.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
there
is
no
question.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
yes.
but
the
sole
issue
throughout
this
case
has
been
the
constitutionality
of
that
residence
restriction.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
certainly,
that’s
so
provided
expressly
in
the
statute.
when
these
durational
residence
requirements
were
enacted,
there
was
of
course
great
concern
and
those,
if
we
look
back,
even
in
the
30’s
realized
that
this
was
a
direct,
had
a
penalizing
effect
on
people
who
were
moving.
in
the
1930’s,
when
congress
first
faced
this
question
with
respect
to
a
public
assistance
benefits
under
the
social
security
act,
it
provided
that
durational
residence
requirements
in
that
area
under
federally
funded
programs
could
not
exceed
a
year.
by
the
time
that
congress
faced
the
question
of
medical
care
in
funding
state
programs
for
medical
care,
the
earliest
being
the
kerr-mills
act
in
1960,
congress
expressly
declared
that
no
state
program
under
congressional
ages
could
be
accepted
if
it
had
any
durational
residence
requirements
whatsoever
for
medical
care.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
that
statute
doesn’t
control
the
action
of
arizona
here
because
arizona
is
not
participating
in
those
programs
and
the
money
here
is
not
under
those
programs.
but
we
do
have
a
square
declaration
by
congress
that
these
durational
requirements
for
medical
care
are
not
sound
public
policy
and
telling
those
states
who
do
participate
in
federal
programs
that
they
cannot
have
them.
this
court
first
considered,
of
course,
the
question
of
durational
residence
in
the
welfare
field,
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
case
which
was
decided
in
1969
and
the
court
there
held
that
to
the
extent
that
states
may
enact
durational
residence
requirements
in
this
field
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
people
out,
penalizing
them
once
they
got
there,
encouraging
them
to
leave,
that
that
was
simply
not
permissible
purpose
for
legislation
and
it
held
that
absent
a
compelling
state
interest,
these
durational
requirements
cannot
stand.
now,
the
shapiro
case,
of
course,
dealt
with
subsistence
cash
welfare
payments.
this
is
medical
care.
we
think
that
if
there’s
any
distinction
between
the
two,
it’s
that
there’s
even
less
justification
for
having
these
requirements
for
medical
care,
then
so
happened
than
that
cash
assistance.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
the
restriction
here
is
broader
than
the
restriction
in
shapiro
because
it
hits
at
both
travel
within
states
and
travel
from
one
state
to
another.
this
particular
case
is
purely
interstate
travel.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
interstate,
your
honor.
yes,
because
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
--
the
appellant
here
moved
from
new
mexico
to
arizona.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
now,
i
think
that
the
difference
--
that
the
fundamental
importance
of
medical
care
can
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
while
congress
was
willing
to
tolerate
a
year
residence
requirements
in
the
area
of
cash
assistance,
it
required
that
they
could
not
stand
in
the
area
of
medical
care.
and
since
this
court’s
decision
in
shapiro,
as
you
can
see
from
a
little
chart
which
we
have
appended
to
our
brief
in
asking
states
what
they
are
doing
now
with
residence
requirements
in
the
medical
field.
there
are
45
states
that
are
not
enforcing
these
requirements
at
all.
there
are
only
a
handful
states
that
are
still
enforcing
it.
and
the
reason
for
it
is
clear
both
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
shapiro
and
as
a
simple
policy
matter
that
where
you
say
that
welfare
benefits,
cash
payments
have
to
be
made
to
people
regardless
of
the
length
of
time
that
they’ve
lived
in
the
state.
you
cannot
at
the
same
time,
unless
there
is
some
compelling
justification
that’s
not
here,
say
that
the
state
can
withhold
the
medical
care
which
may
be
necessary
to
get
people
off
the
relief
rolls
and
to
functional
members
of
the
society.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
your
honor,
that
is
not
this
case
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
the
similar
restriction,
distinction,
classification
among
residence
based
on
the
time
that
they’ve
been
there
would
not
be
present.
so
far,
there
has
been
--
i
can
only
say
that
that
would
be
the
next
case.
certainly,
it
would
be
and
is
not
required
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
the
--
our
position
is
that
we
cannot
distinguish
as
between
residents
based
on
the
length
of
time
that
they
have
resided.
we
do
not
go
so
far
to
say
that
there
are
--
there
may
certainly
other
considerations,
but
when
dealing
with
transients
who
have
a
place
of
residence
to
which
they
can
turn
to
for
care.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
your
honor,
that
case
and
there
have
been
several
others
that
have
determined
that
in
the
area
of
tuition
for
higher
education
that
we’re
dealing
with
fundamentally
different
thing.
a
luxury
perhaps
that
might
be
called
but
certainly
not
something
that
is
so
essential
to
human
existence
as
medical
care
or
the
kind
of
assistance
payments
involved
in
shapiro.
there
may
also
be
in
the
tuition
and
in
other
areas
to
which
shapiro
has
been
applied.
there
may
be
different
considerations
justifying
the
reason
for
a
residence
requirement,
administrative
concerns,
other
things
which
aren’t
here
which
certainly
were
not
present
in
shapiro.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
form
of
discrimination
as
between
residents
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
they
just
moved
would
be
discriminatory
and
would
have
to
be
--
there
would
have
to
be
a
compelling
reason
for
having
it.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
pardon
me?
approved
the
imposition
of
the
requirement?
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
certainly,
we
recognize,
this
court
has
affirmed
starns
but
let
me,
if
i
may,
simply
quote
to
you
from
what
the
starns
opinion
itself
says
which
is
that,
in
distinguishing
the
area
of
fundamental
necessities,
welfare,
medical
care
from
hospital
to
--
from
tuition,
it
says
that,
“shapiro
involved
the
immediate
and
pressing
need
for
preservation
of
life
and
health
for
persons
unable
to
live
without
public
assistance.”
and
it
distinguished
that
situation
from
the
tuition
situation
and
we
do
adhere
that
the
fundamental
point
here
is
that
we
do
deal
with
something
that
is
absolutely
fundamental
to
human
existence.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
in
this
particular
area,
it’s
difficult
to
think
of
one.
the
suggestion
has
been
made
and
i
believe
that
in
the
vlandis
versus
kline
opinion,
the
court
is
concerned
about
possible
administrative
difficulties
in
determining
when
a
person
is
a
resident
for
purposes
of
tuition
because
there
you
have
people
automatically
moving
from
one
family
and
taking
up
residence
somewhere
else.
that
certainly
is
not
a
problem
that
you
find
in
these
areas
with
welfare
assistance.
may
i
say
that
to
emphasize
just
how
necessary
this
kind
of
medical
care
is,
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
emergency
exception
that
is
urged
here
to
be
something
which
somehow
takes
us
out
of
the
shapiro
orbit?
the
fact
is
that
in
the
statute,
emergency
care
is
defined
as
that
care
which
is
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
life
or
limb.
that
means
by
definition
that
unless
death
is
eminent
or
amputation
is
necessary,
virtually,
that
the
care
will
not
be
provided.
in
the
context
of
this
very
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
someone
obviously
needed
medical
care
because
he
wasn’t
able
to
breathe,
but
he
wasn’t
going
to
stop
breathing
altogether,
so
he
was
denied
it.
in
other
situations,
cancer,
diagnosed
cancer
patients
have
been
denied
medical
care
because
they
did
not
meet
the
residence
requirement.
now
presumably,
because
although
their
disease,
unless
treated
at
an
early
stage,
would
be
fatal
eventually,
wasn’t
going
to
be
fatal
right
then.
there
are
situations
where
very
serious
burn
and
disfigurement
where
care
has
been
denied.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
i’m
saying
within
this
statute,
it
is
not
an
emergency
and
therefore
care
is
denied.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
i
am
--
i
don’t
know
for
what
purpose
this
emergency
exception
was
put
in.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
“if
you
are
in
emergency,
even
if
you
haven’t
met
the
durational
requirement,
we’ll
treat
you.”
then
we
must
look
to
see
what
an
emergency
is.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
it
is
a
medical
determination
but
it
--
but
it’s
not
always
made
by
a
medical
doctor.
that
is
one
of
the
problems
here
and
it
because
it’s
defined
in
the
statute
is
that
treatment
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
life.
as
it
is
applied
in
arizona,
it
means
that
those
suffering
from
cancer
are
not
considered
emergencies
and
therefore
denied
treatment
until
they
meet
the
residence
requirement.
if
that
being,
the
treatment
is
either
delayed
until
it
may
be
too
late
and
treatment
is
more
costly
where
the
person
is
made
to
suffer
throughout
the
waiting
period.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
what
was,
i’m
sorry?
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
was
a
--
yes,
a
mental
health.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
it
was.
it’s
said
that
if
the
patient
had
not
been
a
resident
for
a
year
then
there
would
be
a
transfer
back
to
the
state
where
the
patient
came
from.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
you
affirmed
the
district
court’s
decision
that
that
was
unconstitutional.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
i
certainly
do.
yes,
i
mentioned
that
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
i
think
it’s
and
i
believe
that
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
court
has
agreed
to
hear
this
one
because
there
was
such
a
direct
conflict.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
they
went
the
other
way
around.
the
three-judge
court
was
first,
vaughan
was
second.
the
only
thing
that
really
troubled
judge
craig
in
the
mental
health
case
was
that
he
was
troubled
that
perhaps
mental
health
wasn’t
quite
as
vital
to
human
existence
as
the
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
it
was
a
single
judge
and
who
get
in
the
mental
health
case
and
he
did
not
participate
in
the
valenciano
case.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
the
court
has
raised
the
question
of
interstate
versus
intrastate
travel.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
[voice
overlap]
pardon
me?
i’m
sorry.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
it
was
a
different
court,
yes.
but
excuse
me
if
i
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
i
--
there
we
have
two
three-judge
court
decisions.
i
apologize
to
the
court.
as
we
have
seen,
we
have
here
a
statute
which
affects
people
who
move
not
only
between
states
but
also
people
who
move
from
county
to
county.
a
suggestion
is
made
that
somehow
that
lessens
the
constitutional
infirmities.
the
fact,
is
that
here
we
have
purely
interstate
travel.
we
have
a
restriction
that
is
even
more
severe
than
the
restriction
in
the
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
we
certainly
would
and
we
point
out
that
in
dunn
versus
blumstein,
the
voting
rights
case.
now,
this
court
invalidated
both
the
state
residence
requirement
and
a
local
residents
requirement
for
voting
and
we
believe
that
the
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
the
local
residence
requirement?
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
so
that’s
exactly
what
we
have
here.
it
does
affect
interstate
travel.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
it
is
not.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
it
is
not.
and
i
--
but
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
its
opinion
in
upholding
the
statute
somehow
felt,
and
i
cannot
give
it
to
you
in
most
coherent
terms
because
i’m
not
sure
[attempt
to
laughter]
exactly
what
they
were
concerned
about.
but
i
think
they
felt
that
somehow
that
there
was
more
justification
perhaps
to
hitting
a
travel
between
counties
within
the
state
than
with
interstate
travel.
we
can
only
say
that
the
right
to
travel
has
to
be
a
fundamental
precept
that
applies
to
anyone
traveling
in
united
states
not
only
because
he
happens
to
cross
the
state
line
but
as
between
counties
within
the
same
state.
the
given
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
they
are.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
i
can't
tell
you,
your
honor,
whether
there
are
no
state
funds
but
they
are
principally
raised
by
county
revenues
[voice
overlap].
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
may
have
been
what
the
concern
was.
yes,
but
the
effect
of
the
statute
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that’s
correct.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
approximately
a
million.
the
state
has
approximately
two
million
total.
yes.
and
so,
one
of
the
reasons
presumably
was
is
that
maricopa
county
and
they
have
said
to
this
court
in
their
papers
to
the
court
that
they’re
concern
about
people
coming
not
only
from
outside
of
the
state
but
from
other
counties
in
arizona
too.
maricopa
county
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
ten.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
fourteen.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
there
are.
there
--
i
think
believe
there’s
approximately
one
county
has
no
medical
facility.
what
we
have
here
is
obviously
a
serious
penalty
on
those
who
travel.
it’s
one
which
can
be
justified
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
only
by
compelling
interest.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
i
think
that
the
two
have
to
be
read
together
to
a
certain
extent
because
in
shapiro,
the
court
said
that
because
the
classification
was
such
that
it
discriminated
against
those
who
had
only
recently
come
into
the
state
as
opposed
to
those
who
have
been
there
longer
that
that
kind
of
a
classification
could
be
justified
only
on
a
basis
of
a
compelling
interest.
so,
that
we
meet
that
equal
protection
point
of
what
is
there
a
reason
for
making
this
distinction.
and
what
the
court
said
in
shapiro
was
that
to
the
extent
that
the
justification
is
that
we
want
to
keep
people
out
or
to
encourage
them
to
move
once
they
get
here,
that
this
is
not
a
permissible
justification
at
all.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
if
we
had
a
non-indigent?
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
under
the
--
they
would
not
be
seeking
a
medical
care,
i
presume.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
we
are
here
because
the
statute
classifies
indigents
into
two
categories,
those
who
have
been
in
the
state
more
than
a
year
and
those
who
have
been
in
the
state
less
than
year.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
we
would
be
here
on
a
different
case.
we
would
not
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
the
county
hospital?
i
believe
that
there
are
facilities.
yes,
if
they
will
pay
the
cost
of
the
care.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
i’m
not
--
i
believe
that
that
is
true.
you
may
want
to
direct
that
question
to
the
counsel
for
the
county.
i
believe
that
if
you’re
willing
to
pay
then
the
county
makes
its
facilities
available
to
those
who
live
out
the
state
and
i
believe
that
this
in
the
abortion
decisions,
i
believe
that
this
court
squarely
held
that
a
state
couldn’t
limit
its
facilities
only
to
residents
in
the
state.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
the
residence
requirement
is
only
for
indigents.
it
is
our
clear
statement
that
for
those
indigents
who
have
lived
for
longer
than
a
year,
free
care
will
be
available
and
for
those
who
don’t
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
we
wouldn’t
be
here
on
this
case.
yes,
that’s
true.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
mr.
chief
justice,
the
answer
has
to
be
that
if
a
person
moves
to
the
state
of
arizona,
makes
that
his
residence
then
he
cannot
be
denied
the
care
simply
because
he
only
recently
moved.
regardless
of
whether
he
was
motivated
there
for
his
health
or
whether
he
moved
to
visit
his
family
or
for
whatever
reason.
in
this
case,
we
have
to
have
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
this
classification.
we
don’t
have
it.
we
have
the
county
saying
first
that
we
need
this
statute
in
order
to
keep
people
from
flooding
in.
well,
this
is
precisely
what
the
court
held
in
shapiro
was
not
a
legitimate
purpose
at
all.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
as
this
statute
is
drawn,
i
believe
that
it
is
not
limited
to
people
who
come
from
outside
of
the
united
states
to
the
united
states.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
that
right
wouldn’t
extend.
but
so
long
as
the
county
makes
its
facilities
available
to
residents
who
have
moved
from
canada
there
more
than
a
year,
then
it
shouldn’t
deny
them
because
they’ve
been
there
less
than
a
year.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
i
don’t
have
to
answer
in
this
case
because
we
have
a
resident.
we
do
not
assert
that
the
county
must
make
all
its
facilities
available
to
everyone
regardless
of
where
they
live
because
in
the
situation
of
a
transient,
of
someone
coming
is
dispositive,
someone
coming
from
the
state
of
washington
to
arizona,
he
can
go
back
to
washington
and
get
the
care.
for
someone
who
comes
to
maricopa
county,
moves
there
to
live
there,
he
has
no
place
elsewhere
he
can
return
to.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
there
are
problems
in
treating
indigents.
we
recognize
it
but
we’re
not
there
yet
in
this
case.
we
are
not
at
this
point
raising
that
case.
under
the
opinions
of
this
court,
i
have
not
indicated
that
these
welfare
assistance
programs
must
be
available
to
everyone
regardless
of
their
residence.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
it
does.
and
we
recognize
and
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
that
many
of
the
considerations
here
apply
equally
to
transients
as
well
as
to
residents
but
we
are
not
certain
in
this
case
that
the
facilities
must
be
open
to
that
extent.
but
it
certainly
must
--
they
must
be
open
to
residents
on
an
equal
basis
and
the
only
justification
from
the
county
that
we
have
is
that
it’s
going
to
be
more
costly.
this
is
precisely
what
was
held
in
shapiro
to
be
not
a
compelling
interest
and
not
one
which
can
justify
a
statute
like
this.
let
me
simply
say
in
conclusion
that
the
opinion
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
virtually
the
only
decision
in
the
welfare
field
which
had
sustained
the
validity
of
durational
requirements
like
this.
we
think
it
should
be
the
last.
the
discrimination
here
is
invidious
to
suffering
that
the
people
having
to
meet
these
requirements
is
real.
the
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
delay
treatment
until
it
is
more
costly
and
until
it
may
be
too
late
altogether.
and
it
is
to
transfer
a
burden
from
the
taxpayer
basis
as
a
whole
to
paying
patients
at
hospitals
in
the
time
when
they
can
at
least
afford
to
pay
that
cost.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
you
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
the
issue
before
you
is
the
constitutionality
of
an
arizona
statute
that
denies
medical
care
at
public
expense
to
residents
who
have
not
been
residents
a
year.
this
court
presumably
has
taken
jurisdiction
of
this
case
because
the
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
that
requirement
was
in
direct
conflict
with
the
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
arizona
which
invalidated
the
identical
provision
as
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
an
infringement
on
their
right
to
travel.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
in
almost
is
direct
conflict
with
a
determination
of
this
court
in
affirming
a
district
court
decision
in
arizona
which
invalidated
a
similar
durational
residence
requirements
for
mental
health
care
in
arizona.
the
case
arises
here
because
in
1971,
a
man
named
henry
evaro
moved
from
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
that
state
of
arizona,
intending
to
make
arizona
his
home
and
his
residence.
about
six
weeks
after
he
moved
to
arizona,
he
became
very
seriously
ill
with
an
acute
respiratory
illness.
he
was
gasping
for
breath.
it’s
been
stipulated
below
he
clearly
required
medical
attention
to
restore
his
health.
he
went
to
his
private
doctor,
but
his
private
doctor
told
him,
he
needed
hospitalization
and
referred
him
to
a
private
hospital,
memorial
hospital,
the
appellant
here.
when
he
went
to
memorial
hospital,
the
hospital
determined
that
he
was
indigent
and
asked
under
their
appropriate
procedures,
the
county
hospital
either
take
mr.
evaro
as
a
patient,
give
him
treatment
there
or
that
the
county
reimburse
memorial
hospital
for
the
cost
which
it
would
expend
in
giving
mr.
evaro
treatment.
the
county
refused.
in
doing
so
it
acted
in
accordance
with
the
statute
which
says
that
“unless
there
is
an
emergency”
and
i
will
discuss
that
exception
in
a
few
moments
if
it
please
the
court,
mr.
evaro
was
clearly
not
in
emergency
case
even
though
he
needed
care
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
the
county
said
that
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
it
could
not
give
him
care
because
he
had
not
been
a
resident
for
a
year.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
and
i’m
here
representing
mr.
evaro
and
that
hospital
because
the
private
hospitals
in
arizona
have
a
very
real
concern
in
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
sir.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
is
the
county
hospital
operated
at
public
expense,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that’s
true.
out
of
decency,
the
private
hospitals
will
take
on
as
many
patients
as
they
can.
they
can't
handle
it
all,
but
they
take
on
what
they
can
and
when
they
do,
the
cost
had
to
be
born
somewhere
and
they
are
passed
on
to
paying
patients
at
the
time
when
it’s
particularly
difficult
for
them
to
bear
this
cost
as
well.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
your
honor.
this
is
a
state
statute
which
imposes
a
county
residence
requirement.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
he
has
to
be
a
resident
of
the
county,
so
that
it
bars
all
those
like
mr.
evaro
who
travel
from
one
state
to
another
as
well
as
those
who
move
within
the
state
of
arizona.
the
statute
itself
was
passed
in
the
1930’s
at
a
time
when
the
legislature
was
very
much
concerned
about
the
tremendous
movement
of
people
in
the
united
states,
particularly
coming
into
arizona.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
your
honor,
the
statute
does
provide
that
if
the
county
is
unable
to
provide
care
at
the
county
hospital,
that
it
can
reimburse
private
hospitals,
provided
that
they
meet
the
residence
requirement.
when
this
statute
was
passed,
there
was
a
concern
appended
to
our
brief
legislative
history
showing
that
these
durational
residence
requirements
were
passed
at
the
time
when
there
was
a
great
deal
of
movement
throughout
the
country,
particularly
in
arizona.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
it
could’ve
been
accepted
at
the
county
hospital
because
he
wasn’t
eligible
for
treatment
at
county
expense.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
what
happened
here,
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
because
he
did
not
meet
the
residence
requirement,
the
private
hospital
which
cared
for
him
was
not
entitled
to
reimbursement
by
the
county.
most
of
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
he
was
referred
to
the
private
hospital,
but
had
he
gone
to
the
county
hospital,
the
county
hospital
would’ve
told
him
that
unless
you
can
pay
your
bills,
you
can't
--
we
can't
treat
you
here
and
he
would
have
to
go
elsewhere.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
except
that
it
happened,
so
he
went
to
a
private
hospital
which
did
give
him
treatment
at
considerable
expense.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
but,
your
honor,
this
--
i
don’t
think
there
can
be
a
serious
question
here
with
the
statute
imposing
this
requirement
and
enforced
in
this
manner.
the
statute
was,
of
course,
passed
when
the
state
was
concerned
about
people
coming
in.
it
was
passed
at
the
same
time
with
durational
residence
requirements
for
public
assistance.
cash
welfare
benefits
were
passed.
it
was
in
the
same
period
that
california
enacted
its
absolute
bar
to
indigents
in
the
state
that
would
struck
down
a
generation
that
go
by
this
court
in
edwards
versus
california.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
there
is
no
question.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
yes.
but
the
sole
issue
throughout
this
case
has
been
the
constitutionality
of
that
residence
restriction.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
certainly,
that’s
so
provided
expressly
in
the
statute.
when
these
durational
residence
requirements
were
enacted,
there
was
of
course
great
concern
and
those,
if
we
look
back,
even
in
the
30’s
realized
that
this
was
a
direct,
had
a
penalizing
effect
on
people
who
were
moving.
in
the
1930’s,
when
congress
first
faced
this
question
with
respect
to
a
public
assistance
benefits
under
the
social
security
act,
it
provided
that
durational
residence
requirements
in
that
area
under
federally
funded
programs
could
not
exceed
a
year.
by
the
time
that
congress
faced
the
question
of
medical
care
in
funding
state
programs
for
medical
care,
the
earliest
being
the
kerr-mills
act
in
1960,
congress
expressly
declared
that
no
state
program
under
congressional
ages
could
be
accepted
if
it
had
any
durational
residence
requirements
whatsoever
for
medical
care.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
that
statute
doesn’t
control
the
action
of
arizona
here
because
arizona
is
not
participating
in
those
programs
and
the
money
here
is
not
under
those
programs.
but
we
do
have
a
square
declaration
by
congress
that
these
durational
requirements
for
medical
care
are
not
sound
public
policy
and
telling
those
states
who
do
participate
in
federal
programs
that
they
cannot
have
them.
this
court
first
considered,
of
course,
the
question
of
durational
residence
in
the
welfare
field,
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
case
which
was
decided
in
1969
and
the
court
there
held
that
to
the
extent
that
states
may
enact
durational
residence
requirements
in
this
field
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
people
out,
penalizing
them
once
they
got
there,
encouraging
them
to
leave,
that
that
was
simply
not
permissible
purpose
for
legislation
and
it
held
that
absent
a
compelling
state
interest,
these
durational
requirements
cannot
stand.
now,
the
shapiro
case,
of
course,
dealt
with
subsistence
cash
welfare
payments.
this
is
medical
care.
we
think
that
if
there’s
any
distinction
between
the
two,
it’s
that
there’s
even
less
justification
for
having
these
requirements
for
medical
care,
then
so
happened
than
that
cash
assistance.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
the
restriction
here
is
broader
than
the
restriction
in
shapiro
because
it
hits
at
both
travel
within
states
and
travel
from
one
state
to
another.
this
particular
case
is
purely
interstate
travel.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
interstate,
your
honor.
yes,
because
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
--
the
appellant
here
moved
from
new
mexico
to
arizona.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
now,
i
think
that
the
difference
--
that
the
fundamental
importance
of
medical
care
can
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
while
congress
was
willing
to
tolerate
a
year
residence
requirements
in
the
area
of
cash
assistance,
it
required
that
they
could
not
stand
in
the
area
of
medical
care.
and
since
this
court’s
decision
in
shapiro,
as
you
can
see
from
a
little
chart
which
we
have
appended
to
our
brief
in
asking
states
what
they
are
doing
now
with
residence
requirements
in
the
medical
field.
there
are
45
states
that
are
not
enforcing
these
requirements
at
all.
there
are
only
a
handful
states
that
are
still
enforcing
it.
and
the
reason
for
it
is
clear
both
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
shapiro
and
as
a
simple
policy
matter
that
where
you
say
that
welfare
benefits,
cash
payments
have
to
be
made
to
people
regardless
of
the
length
of
time
that
they’ve
lived
in
the
state.
you
cannot
at
the
same
time,
unless
there
is
some
compelling
justification
that’s
not
here,
say
that
the
state
can
withhold
the
medical
care
which
may
be
necessary
to
get
people
off
the
relief
rolls
and
to
functional
members
of
the
society.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
your
honor,
that
is
not
this
case
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
the
similar
restriction,
distinction,
classification
among
residence
based
on
the
time
that
they’ve
been
there
would
not
be
present.
so
far,
there
has
been
--
i
can
only
say
that
that
would
be
the
next
case.
certainly,
it
would
be
and
is
not
required
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
the
--
our
position
is
that
we
cannot
distinguish
as
between
residents
based
on
the
length
of
time
that
they
have
resided.
we
do
not
go
so
far
to
say
that
there
are
--
there
may
certainly
other
considerations,
but
when
dealing
with
transients
who
have
a
place
of
residence
to
which
they
can
turn
to
for
care.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
your
honor,
that
case
and
there
have
been
several
others
that
have
determined
that
in
the
area
of
tuition
for
higher
education
that
we’re
dealing
with
fundamentally
different
thing.
a
luxury
perhaps
that
might
be
called
but
certainly
not
something
that
is
so
essential
to
human
existence
as
medical
care
or
the
kind
of
assistance
payments
involved
in
shapiro.
there
may
also
be
in
the
tuition
and
in
other
areas
to
which
shapiro
has
been
applied.
there
may
be
different
considerations
justifying
the
reason
for
a
residence
requirement,
administrative
concerns,
other
things
which
aren’t
here
which
certainly
were
not
present
in
shapiro.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
form
of
discrimination
as
between
residents
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
they
just
moved
would
be
discriminatory
and
would
have
to
be
--
there
would
have
to
be
a
compelling
reason
for
having
it.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
pardon
me?
approved
the
imposition
of
the
requirement?
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
certainly,
we
recognize,
this
court
has
affirmed
starns
but
let
me,
if
i
may,
simply
quote
to
you
from
what
the
starns
opinion
itself
says
which
is
that,
in
distinguishing
the
area
of
fundamental
necessities,
welfare,
medical
care
from
hospital
to
--
from
tuition,
it
says
that,
“shapiro
involved
the
immediate
and
pressing
need
for
preservation
of
life
and
health
for
persons
unable
to
live
without
public
assistance.”
and
it
distinguished
that
situation
from
the
tuition
situation
and
we
do
adhere
that
the
fundamental
point
here
is
that
we
do
deal
with
something
that
is
absolutely
fundamental
to
human
existence.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
in
this
particular
area,
it’s
difficult
to
think
of
one.
the
suggestion
has
been
made
and
i
believe
that
in
the
vlandis
versus
kline
opinion,
the
court
is
concerned
about
possible
administrative
difficulties
in
determining
when
a
person
is
a
resident
for
purposes
of
tuition
because
there
you
have
people
automatically
moving
from
one
family
and
taking
up
residence
somewhere
else.
that
certainly
is
not
a
problem
that
you
find
in
these
areas
with
welfare
assistance.
may
i
say
that
to
emphasize
just
how
necessary
this
kind
of
medical
care
is,
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
emergency
exception
that
is
urged
here
to
be
something
which
somehow
takes
us
out
of
the
shapiro
orbit?
the
fact
is
that
in
the
statute,
emergency
care
is
defined
as
that
care
which
is
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
life
or
limb.
that
means
by
definition
that
unless
death
is
eminent
or
amputation
is
necessary,
virtually,
that
the
care
will
not
be
provided.
in
the
context
of
this
very
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
someone
obviously
needed
medical
care
because
he
wasn’t
able
to
breathe,
but
he
wasn’t
going
to
stop
breathing
altogether,
so
he
was
denied
it.
in
other
situations,
cancer,
diagnosed
cancer
patients
have
been
denied
medical
care
because
they
did
not
meet
the
residence
requirement.
now
presumably,
because
although
their
disease,
unless
treated
at
an
early
stage,
would
be
fatal
eventually,
wasn’t
going
to
be
fatal
right
then.
there
are
situations
where
very
serious
burn
and
disfigurement
where
care
has
been
denied.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
i’m
saying
within
this
statute,
it
is
not
an
emergency
and
therefore
care
is
denied.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
i
am
--
i
don’t
know
for
what
purpose
this
emergency
exception
was
put
in.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
“if
you
are
in
emergency,
even
if
you
haven’t
met
the
durational
requirement,
we’ll
treat
you.”
then
we
must
look
to
see
what
an
emergency
is.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
it
is
a
medical
determination
but
it
--
but
it’s
not
always
made
by
a
medical
doctor.
that
is
one
of
the
problems
here
and
it
because
it’s
defined
in
the
statute
is
that
treatment
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
life.
as
it
is
applied
in
arizona,
it
means
that
those
suffering
from
cancer
are
not
considered
emergencies
and
therefore
denied
treatment
until
they
meet
the
residence
requirement.
if
that
being,
the
treatment
is
either
delayed
until
it
may
be
too
late
and
treatment
is
more
costly
where
the
person
is
made
to
suffer
throughout
the
waiting
period.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
what
was,
i’m
sorry?
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
was
a
--
yes,
a
mental
health.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
it
was.
it’s
said
that
if
the
patient
had
not
been
a
resident
for
a
year
then
there
would
be
a
transfer
back
to
the
state
where
the
patient
came
from.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
you
affirmed
the
district
court’s
decision
that
that
was
unconstitutional.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
i
certainly
do.
yes,
i
mentioned
that
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
i
think
it’s
and
i
believe
that
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
court
has
agreed
to
hear
this
one
because
there
was
such
a
direct
conflict.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
they
went
the
other
way
around.
the
three-judge
court
was
first,
vaughan
was
second.
the
only
thing
that
really
troubled
judge
craig
in
the
mental
health
case
was
that
he
was
troubled
that
perhaps
mental
health
wasn’t
quite
as
vital
to
human
existence
as
the
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
it
was
a
single
judge
and
who
get
in
the
mental
health
case
and
he
did
not
participate
in
the
valenciano
case.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
the
court
has
raised
the
question
of
interstate
versus
intrastate
travel.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
[voice
overlap]
pardon
me?
i’m
sorry.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
it
was
a
different
court,
yes.
but
excuse
me
if
i
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
i
--
there
we
have
two
three-judge
court
decisions.
i
apologize
to
the
court.
as
we
have
seen,
we
have
here
a
statute
which
affects
people
who
move
not
only
between
states
but
also
people
who
move
from
county
to
county.
a
suggestion
is
made
that
somehow
that
lessens
the
constitutional
infirmities.
the
fact,
is
that
here
we
have
purely
interstate
travel.
we
have
a
restriction
that
is
even
more
severe
than
the
restriction
in
the
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
we
certainly
would
and
we
point
out
that
in
dunn
versus
blumstein,
the
voting
rights
case.
now,
this
court
invalidated
both
the
state
residence
requirement
and
a
local
residents
requirement
for
voting
and
we
believe
that
the
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
the
local
residence
requirement?
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
so
that’s
exactly
what
we
have
here.
it
does
affect
interstate
travel.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
it
is
not.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
it
is
not.
and
i
--
but
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
its
opinion
in
upholding
the
statute
somehow
felt,
and
i
cannot
give
it
to
you
in
most
coherent
terms
because
i’m
not
sure
[attempt
to
laughter]
exactly
what
they
were
concerned
about.
but
i
think
they
felt
that
somehow
that
there
was
more
justification
perhaps
to
hitting
a
travel
between
counties
within
the
state
than
with
interstate
travel.
we
can
only
say
that
the
right
to
travel
has
to
be
a
fundamental
precept
that
applies
to
anyone
traveling
in
united
states
not
only
because
he
happens
to
cross
the
state
line
but
as
between
counties
within
the
same
state.
the
given
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
they
are.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
i
can't
tell
you,
your
honor,
whether
there
are
no
state
funds
but
they
are
principally
raised
by
county
revenues
[voice
overlap].
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that
may
have
been
what
the
concern
was.
yes,
but
the
effect
of
the
statute
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
that’s
correct.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
approximately
a
million.
the
state
has
approximately
two
million
total.
yes.
and
so,
one
of
the
reasons
presumably
was
is
that
maricopa
county
and
they
have
said
to
this
court
in
their
papers
to
the
court
that
they’re
concern
about
people
coming
not
only
from
outside
of
the
state
but
from
other
counties
in
arizona
too.
maricopa
county
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
ten.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
fourteen.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
there
are.
there
--
i
think
believe
there’s
approximately
one
county
has
no
medical
facility.
what
we
have
here
is
obviously
a
serious
penalty
on
those
who
travel.
it’s
one
which
can
be
justified
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
only
by
compelling
interest.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
i
think
that
the
two
have
to
be
read
together
to
a
certain
extent
because
in
shapiro,
the
court
said
that
because
the
classification
was
such
that
it
discriminated
against
those
who
had
only
recently
come
into
the
state
as
opposed
to
those
who
have
been
there
longer
that
that
kind
of
a
classification
could
be
justified
only
on
a
basis
of
a
compelling
interest.
so,
that
we
meet
that
equal
protection
point
of
what
is
there
a
reason
for
making
this
distinction.
and
what
the
court
said
in
shapiro
was
that
to
the
extent
that
the
justification
is
that
we
want
to
keep
people
out
or
to
encourage
them
to
move
once
they
get
here,
that
this
is
not
a
permissible
justification
at
all.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
if
we
had
a
non-indigent?
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
under
the
--
they
would
not
be
seeking
a
medical
care,
i
presume.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
we
are
here
because
the
statute
classifies
indigents
into
two
categories,
those
who
have
been
in
the
state
more
than
a
year
and
those
who
have
been
in
the
state
less
than
year.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
we
would
be
here
on
a
different
case.
we
would
not
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
the
county
hospital?
i
believe
that
there
are
facilities.
yes,
if
they
will
pay
the
cost
of
the
care.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
i’m
not
--
i
believe
that
that
is
true.
you
may
want
to
direct
that
question
to
the
counsel
for
the
county.
i
believe
that
if
you’re
willing
to
pay
then
the
county
makes
its
facilities
available
to
those
who
live
out
the
state
and
i
believe
that
this
in
the
abortion
decisions,
i
believe
that
this
court
squarely
held
that
a
state
couldn’t
limit
its
facilities
only
to
residents
in
the
state.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes.
the
residence
requirement
is
only
for
indigents.
it
is
our
clear
statement
that
for
those
indigents
who
have
lived
for
longer
than
a
year,
free
care
will
be
available
and
for
those
who
don’t
--
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
we
wouldn’t
be
here
on
this
case.
yes,
that’s
true.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
mr.
chief
justice,
the
answer
has
to
be
that
if
a
person
moves
to
the
state
of
arizona,
makes
that
his
residence
then
he
cannot
be
denied
the
care
simply
because
he
only
recently
moved.
regardless
of
whether
he
was
motivated
there
for
his
health
or
whether
he
moved
to
visit
his
family
or
for
whatever
reason.
in
this
case,
we
have
to
have
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
this
classification.
we
don’t
have
it.
we
have
the
county
saying
first
that
we
need
this
statute
in
order
to
keep
people
from
flooding
in.
well,
this
is
precisely
what
the
court
held
in
shapiro
was
not
a
legitimate
purpose
at
all.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
as
this
statute
is
drawn,
i
believe
that
it
is
not
limited
to
people
who
come
from
outside
of
the
united
states
to
the
united
states.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no,
that
right
wouldn’t
extend.
but
so
long
as
the
county
makes
its
facilities
available
to
residents
who
have
moved
from
canada
there
more
than
a
year,
then
it
shouldn’t
deny
them
because
they’ve
been
there
less
than
a
year.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
no.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
i
don’t
have
to
answer
in
this
case
because
we
have
a
resident.
we
do
not
assert
that
the
county
must
make
all
its
facilities
available
to
everyone
regardless
of
where
they
live
because
in
the
situation
of
a
transient,
of
someone
coming
is
dispositive,
someone
coming
from
the
state
of
washington
to
arizona,
he
can
go
back
to
washington
and
get
the
care.
for
someone
who
comes
to
maricopa
county,
moves
there
to
live
there,
he
has
no
place
elsewhere
he
can
return
to.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
well,
there
are
problems
in
treating
indigents.
we
recognize
it
but
we’re
not
there
yet
in
this
case.
we
are
not
at
this
point
raising
that
case.
under
the
opinions
of
this
court,
i
have
not
indicated
that
these
welfare
assistance
programs
must
be
available
to
everyone
regardless
of
their
residence.
ms.
mary
m.
schroeder
yes,
it
does.
and
we
recognize
and
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
that
many
of
the
considerations
here
apply
equally
to
transients
as
well
as
to
residents
but
we
are
not
certain
in
this
case
that
the
facilities
must
be
open
to
that
extent.
but
it
certainly
must
--
they
must
be
open
to
residents
on
an
equal
basis
and
the
only
justification
from
the
county
that
we
have
is
that
it’s
going
to
be
more
costly.
this
is
precisely
what
was
held
in
shapiro
to
be
not
a
compelling
interest
and
not
one
which
can
justify
a
statute
like
this.
let
me
simply
say
in
conclusion
that
the
opinion
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
virtually
the
only
decision
in
the
welfare
field
which
had
sustained
the
validity
of
durational
requirements
like
this.
we
think
it
should
be
the
last.
the
discrimination
here
is
invidious
to
suffering
that
the
people
having
to
meet
these
requirements
is
real.
the
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
delay
treatment
until
it
is
more
costly
and
until
it
may
be
too
late
altogether.
and
it
is
to
transfer
a
burden
from
the
taxpayer
basis
as
a
whole
to
paying
patients
at
hospitals
in
the
time
when
they
can
at
least
afford
to
pay
that
cost.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
