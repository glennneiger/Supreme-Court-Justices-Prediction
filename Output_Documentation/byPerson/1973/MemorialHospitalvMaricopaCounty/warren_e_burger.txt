mrs.

you

chief

warren
e.
burger
for
purposes
of
this
case,
let
me
see
if
i
get
it
clearly.
the
purposes
of
your
basic
issue,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
or
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
in
a
private
hospital
or
in
the
county
hospital?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
the
private
hospital
gets
into
the
picture,
it’s
only
as
a
surrogate
for
the
county,
on
your
theory,
is
it
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
first
applied
to
get
into
a
county
hospital?
chief

e.
burger
and
in
that
--
in
doing
that,
it
would
be
acting
in
effect
as
an
agent
or
surrogate
to
the
state,
that’s
your
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
one
question
to
see
just
how
far
this
goes.
suppose
a
patient
was
diagnosed
as
having
a
lung
disease,
tuberculosis,
up
in
toronto,
canada.
the
doctor
says,
what
you
need
is
warm
climate,
dry
climate,
dry
air,
so
arizona
is
the
place
for
you
to
go.
so,
he
flies
from
toronto
down
to
phoenix
and
comes
in
under
the
statute,
what
about
that?

regard

a
total

view

was
not?
