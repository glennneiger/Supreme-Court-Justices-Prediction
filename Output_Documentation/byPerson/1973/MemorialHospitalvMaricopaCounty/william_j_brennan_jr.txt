justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
schroeder,
is
memorial,
as
i
know,
it’s
nonprofit,
is
it
a
private
hospital
or
public?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
other
case
involved
maricopa
county
hospital,
doesn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that’s
a
public
hospital?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
there’s
no
question,
but
for
the
residence
requirement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
hospital
would
have
been
reimbursed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
the
county
for
the
services
given?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
recognizes
also
that
there’s
a
difference
that
shapiro
dealt
with
travel
between
states,
and
this
is
travel
within
the
state
between
counties,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
intrastate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess,
you
just
said
that
earlier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
schroeder,
what
was
the
statute
in
vaughan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
statute
in
vaughan?
we
affirmed
here
in
validation
of
that
statute
by
a
three-judge
court.
that
was
mental
health?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
a
residence
requirement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
affirmed
that
that
was
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
vaughan
was
at
three-judge
court
below,
wasn’t
it?
the
vaughan
court
was
a
three-judge
court.
we
affirmed
that
direct
[voice
overlap]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it,
if
this
were
county
to
county
case,
you
would
still
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
schroeder,
suppose
we
have
a
non-indigent,
not
an
indigent
here,
would
you
still
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
non-indigent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
expect
this
–
does
the
statute
preclude
the
county
from
taking
a
non-indigent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
how
about
someone
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
aren’t
state
facilities
available
to
non-indigents
at
all?
someone
coming
in
from
california
while
they
go
to
maricopa
hospital?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
looking
at
the
statute
on
its
face,
this
applies,
this
residence
requirement
apparently
applies
only
to
an
indigent
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
answer
to
our
question
is
to
the
non-indigent,
you
wouldn’t
be
here
under
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
would
it
make
a
difference
if
he
were
a
resident
of
the
state
of
washington?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
opposed
to
--
mr.
carter,
well,
do
you
agree
with
this
argument,
would
we
have
to
depart
or
retreat
from
something
they
serve
in
shapiro?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
just
looked
at
it,
the
same
three
judges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
court
thought
that
their
own
previous
decision
was
controlling?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
this
doesn’t
in
a
few
words,
so
i
would
compose
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
it,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
getting
to
be
--
it
doesn’t
matter
how
much
money
you
get
these
days,
that’s
true?
justice
william
j.
