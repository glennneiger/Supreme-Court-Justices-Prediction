justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
feel
that’s
rather
close
to
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
three-judge
court
on
this
statute
rely
on
the
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
would
have
been
a
fortiori
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
valenciano,
the
court
in
valenciano
ended
in
the
same
court,
the
same
three
judges?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
single
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
a
different
court
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
this
all
could
have
read
on
impeding
interstate
travel?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
you
have
a
local
residence
requirement
as
the
state
may
not
require
anything
but
you
might
have
to
live
for
a
year
in
the
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
i
understand
that,
but
so
the
case
is
from
intrastate
travel
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
necessarily?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
if
i
came
--
if
i
haven’t
been
a
resident
of
arizona
for
a
certain
length
of
time,
if
i
could
pay,
i
could
get
into
the
county
hospital,
say
for
some
special
treatment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
this
is
more
like
this
welfare
benefit
which
is
the
rational
basis
test
until
a
medical
need
becomes
acute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
the
three-judge
court
that
decided
that
case,
decided
valenciano
had
thought
that
vaughan
was
controlling?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
it
was,
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
our
affirmance
it’s
noted
in
out
opinion
in
valenciano?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
the
--
i
suppose
some
of
those
hospitals
or
most
of
them
are
required
to
do
some
indigency
work
or
they
lose
their
status,
their
tax
status?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
