justice
thurgood
marshall
because
as
i
have
ever
to
say
my
argument
was
made
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
is
cancer
not
an
emergency?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
can
the
doctor,
if
you
are
resident
--
can
the
doctor
say,
“you
don’t
need
treatment
and
not
treat
you”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
if
the
doctor
says,
i
think,
that
patients
should
be
hospitalized,
does
the
hospital
have
any
discretion
as
to
taking
that
patient
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
all
the
physicians
are
members
of
the
hospital
staff?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
the
private
physician?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
decide
whether
they
needed
treatment
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn’t
that
(inaudible)
difference
of
treatments
and
the
horrible
thing
you
said
that
were
involved
in
shapiro
in
cancer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
don’t
get
any
federal
money?
justice

this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
an
arizona
statute
which
required
a
year’s
residence
in
a
county
as
a
condition
to
an
indigent
is
receiving
nonemergency
hospitalization
or
medical
care
at
county
expense.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
holding
that
the
challenge
durational
residence
requirement
violates
equal
protection
clause.
the
residence
requirement
creates
an
invidious
classification
and
that
penalizes
the
right
of
interstate
migration,
and
denying
medical
care,
a
basic
necessity
of
life
to
indigent
newcomers.
a
classification
which
does
impinges
on
a
constitutional
protected
interest
can
only
be
sustained
on
the
showing
of
a
compelling
state
interest,
a
burden
here,
the
state
has
filed
to
meet.
its
asserted
purpose
of
deterring
the
immigration
of
indigents
is
a
constitutionally
impermissible
one.
the
other
purposes
stated
by
the
state
for
the
residence
requirement
do
not
satisfy
its
having
the
burden
of
justification.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
reversed.
