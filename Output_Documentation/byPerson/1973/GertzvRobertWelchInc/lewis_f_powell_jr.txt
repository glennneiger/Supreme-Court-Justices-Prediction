justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
involves
a
libel
action
by
a
reputable
attorney
against
a
magazine
that’s
falsely
libeled
him
of
leninist
and
a
communist
fronter.
the
district
court
denying
recovery,
held
that
the
subject
of
the
magazine
article
was
a
matter
of
public
interest.
the
court
therefore
applied
the
strict
standard
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
a
case
decided
here
in
1964.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
the
new
york
times
case,
this
court
held
for
the
first
time
that
where
a
public
official
was
a
plaintiff
in
a
libel
case,
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
prove
knowledge
of
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
of
truth.
the
new
york
times
standard
subsequently
was
extended
to
apply
it
to
public
figures
as
well
as
public
officials.
the
rationale
of
this
line
of
cases
is
grounded
of
course
in
the
first
amendment.
we
decline
today
to
extend
new
york
times
to
a
case
where
neither
a
public
official
nor
a
public
figure
is
a
plaintiff,
merely
because
the
publication
is
thought
to
be
a
matter
of
public
interest.
we
recognize
the
state’s
interest
in
protecting
the
reputation
of
private
individuals
must
be
balanced
against
the
first
amendment
interest.
accordingly
we
hold
that
the
states
may
allow
compensatory
damages,
for
libel
which
causes
injury
to
the
reputation
of
private
individuals
without
applying
the
strict
new
york
times
test.
but
we
would
not
approve
the
imposition
of
liability
without
fault
as
we
think
this
would
unduly
burden
a
free
press.
thus
with
regard
to
libel
suits
by
private
individuals,
the
states
will
be
free
to
apply
any
standard
which
does
not
impose
liability
without
fault,
such
as
of
negligence
standard.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
douglas,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
each
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
