stewart
there
were
concurrent
sentences,
as
i
remember
-
justice
potter
stewart
--
were
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
under
the
old
rules,
pre-benton
i
guess
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
wouldn’t
even
be
here,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
and
wouldn’t
have
been
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
after
it
upheld
the
validity
of
the
dyer
act.
justice
potter
stewart
changed
the
maryland
rules
a
little
bit?
justice
potter
stewart
who
ultimately
was
the
victim
of
the
fraud?
who
was
defrauded?
i
suppose
these
innkeepers
and
tradesmen
were
paid,
weren’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
suffer
an
ultimate
loss?
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
loss
was
suffered
by
the
louisville
bank.
justice
potter
stewart
although
the
victim
of
the
fraud
--
victims
of
the
fraud
were
the
four
people
covered
by
these
four
counts
innkeepers
and
others,
who
were
through
misrepresentation
caused
apart
with
their
rooms
or
their
services.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
there
was
no
--
the
fraud
was
perpetrated
therefore
against
the
tradesman
and
innkeepers,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
loss
of
the
louisville
bank
was
hardly
--
the
louisville
bank
was
not
defrauded,
was
it
because
no
misrepresentations
were
made
to
it?
justice
potter
stewart
taking
the
card
in
the
first
place?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
place
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
fraud,
the
actual
misrepresentation
was
made
to
the
innkeepers.
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
respect
to
the
first
count
at
least,
that
fraud
would
have
been
wholly
effective
with
or
without
any
use
of
the
mails,
wouldn't
it
because
as
soon
as
the
person
walked
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
soon
as
this
man
walked
out
of
the
motel
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
he
defrauded
that
innkeeper
and
therefore
no
use
of
the
mails
was
involved
or
at
all
at
that
point,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
your
point
is
that
he
perhaps
could
not
have
continued
to
commit
the
other
three
offenses
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
exception
of
the
delay
occasion
by
the
delay
in
the
mails
and
incidentally
your
argument
is
not
a
very
good
advertisement
for
the
post
office
department.
justice
potter
stewart
since
you
emphasize
the
great
delay.
but
as
to
anyone
of
these
counts,
the
fraud
could
have
been
complete
without
any
use
of
the
mail
at
all,
is
that
right,
certainly,
as
to
the
first
count?
justice
potter
stewart
showed
him
the
card
and
signed
it
whatever
you
do
and
so
the
bill
was
paid.
justice
potter
stewart
ended
right
then
and
there
without
any
use
of
the
mail.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
case
--
but
these
are
four
separate
counts.
if
it
had
been
one
count
and
you
could
have
said
at
one
count
or
covering
this
long,
this
fairly
extended
frolic,
as
you
call
it,
through
interstate
journey,
and
your
argument
were
that
he
could
not
have
continued
his
fraudulent,
has
continued
his
defrauding
of
these
innkeepers
except
by
the
delay
occasioned
by
the
mails,
that
would
be
one
thing
but
each
one
of
these
is
a
separate
count.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
(voice
overlap)
to
any
one
count
the
fraud
was
complete,
was
it
not
when
the
innkeeper
extended
the
credit?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
indicted
as
well
up
to
four
separate
defenses?
justice
potter
stewart
but
did
he
get
one
--
did
he
get
apparent
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
--
what
if
they
enacted
15
united
states
code
section
1644
without
the
limitation
to
$5,000
in
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
still
be
in
high
probate
except
for
the
$5,000
limitation.
justice
potter
stewart
no
questions
comes
to
constitutional
power
--
constitutional
power?
justice
potter
stewart
you
wouldn’t
have
to
have
any
use
of

at

justice

or
western
