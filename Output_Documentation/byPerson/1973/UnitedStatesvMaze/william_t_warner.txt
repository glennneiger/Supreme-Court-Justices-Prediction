mr.
william
t.
warner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
respond
directly
to
several
points
and
contentions
raised
by
mrs.
lafontant,
but
with
the
court’s
indulgence
i
would
like
to
do
within
the
context
of
presenting
two
major
considerations
which
i
feel
are
important
and
are
before
the
court
this
morning
in
this
case.
now
the
first
is
the,
what
we
consider
to
be
other
failure
of
the
government’s
proof
upon
the
issue
of
knowing
use
of
the
mails
including
the
so
called
delay
issue.
the
second
point
is
the
reasonableness,
propriety,
and
or
the
necessity
of
extending
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
to
this
case
and
other
cases
similar
to
it.
now,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
it’s
possible.
i
think
in
this
case
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
submit
that
it
would
to
the
extent
that
as
mrs.
lafontant
pointed
out
the
ultimate
loser
in
terms
of
who
ended
up
with
the
paying
the
bill
in
this
case
was
the
citizens
fidelity
bank
in
louisville,
kentucky.
they
took
the
responsibility.
they
had
to
pay
these
invoices.
maze
was
caught
in
kentucky.
he
was
caught
30
miles
from
louisville
and
presumably
as
we
cover
in
our
brief
and
as
a
matter
of
record,
the
kentucky
statutes
are
more
than
adequate
to
cover
every
aspect
of
the
so
called
scheme
from
the
misappropriation
or
theft
to
the
credit
card
right
on
through
to
the
defrauding
of
the
bank.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case,
i
think
should
be
pointed
out
was
not
as
broadly
drawn
as
the
government
contends.
it
said
that
a
very
carefully
drawn
opinion
and
it
said
essentially
that
the
government
did
not
prove
in
this
case
by
the
evidence
of
record
that
maze
could
have
foreseen
or
knew
that
mails
would
be
used
or
that
the
mails
were
inescapably
direct
incident
between
the
defrauding
of
the
innkeepers
and
the
defrauding
of
the
bank.
now,
i
think
it’s
significant
to
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
well
sir,
in
this
case,
there
were
four
vendors
who
testified.
two
stated
that
they
customarily
used
them
in
the
mails.
they
dropped
them
in
the
mails
and
they
were
sent
in.
one
said
--
testified
that
they
went
through
bank
channels,
that
was
the
extent
of
this
testimony
and
one
vendor
i
believe
was
indefinite
or
stated
he
didn’t
know.
so
the
proof
was
not
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
this
is
a
question
in
this
case
that
some
of
the
circuits
have
raised
with
respect
to
charging
a
defendant
such
as
maze
with
a
detailed
knowledge
of
the
very
complex
and
intricate
commercial
scheme.
i
assume
that
the
mails
were
used.
i
would.
but
there
may
be
other
ways.
i
don’t
know
how
the
banks
transmit
matters
of
this
type
and
maybe
like
they
do
checks
through
the
mail.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
on
this
proof
issue,
i
think
it’s
significant
in
response
partially
to
a
question
that
you
addressed
to
mrs.
lafontant.
maze
did
testify
in
this
case.
in
other
way
testified,
in
his
own
behalf,
but
he
gave
a
statement
to
the
postal
inspector.
now,
neither
the
postal
inspectors
or
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
tried
the
case
addressed
one
single
question
to
maze
on
the
knowing
use
of
the
mails
or
did
he
know
or
did
he
contemplate
or
could
you
know.
in
order
the
government
introduced
any
other
witness
as
on
this
issue
as
to
how
the
mails
are
necessary
incident
of
this
type
of
fraud.
now,
also,
i
want
to
point
out
that
at
this
point,
that
the
government
contends
that
there
are
six
circuits
which
support
this
so
called
per
se
doctrine
that
the
fraudulent
use
of
a
credit
card
is
per
se
the
use
of
the
mails.
now,
if
my
reading
of
the
cases
does
not
support
this
view,
there
are
at
least
two
circuits,
the
fifth
certainly
in
the
adams
case
which
was
the
fundamental
case
on
the
per
se
doctrine
supports
this
view.
the
seventh
circuit
does
and
perhaps,
i
am
sorry,
the
second
circuit
in
the
kellerman
series
of
cases
and
most
recently
the
third
circuit
in
the
ciotti
case.
now,
the
other
cases
involved
varying
kinds
of
fraud.
and
as
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
isaac’s
case
in
1968
that
the
forms
of
fraud
which
are
possible
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
are
multifarious
as
human
ingenuity
can
device,
and
i
think
that
this
should
be
kept
in
mind.
now,
the
government
case
on
the
knowing
use
of
the
mails
issue,
we
submit
is
built
on
a
series
of
presuppositions
and
assumptions.
now,
it’s
long
been
the
rule
under
our
system
of
jurisprudence
that
we
don’t
convict
people
upon
presuppositions
and
assumptions,
and
that
this
as
were
partially
at
least
where
the
government
case
failed.
now,
as
i
stated
earlier
in
response
to
chief
justice’s
question,
the
trouble
with
the
per
se
doctrine,
that
is
the
doctrine
that
the
fraudulent
presentation
and/or
use
of
the
credit
card
per
se
involves
the
mail
is
that
this
imposes
on
the
defendant
a
detailed
knowledge
of
a
very
complex
commercial
mechanism.
and
again,
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
in
this
case.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
stated
specifically
that
they
were
not
holding
that
credit
card
abuse
could
never
constitute
mail
fraud.
they
stated
in
this
case,
in
this
case
that
the
government’s
proof
had
failed.
now,
with
regard
to
the
alleged
scheme,
i
think
the
facts
are
significant
here.
the
card
was
misappropriated
stolen
on
april
10,
1971.
now,
maze
was
arrested
and
in
jail
on
may
9,
1971.
now,
there
was
no
extensive
long
range
scheme
such
as
the
one
in
the
chason
case
which
is
the
second
circuit
case
involving
a
man
who
obtained
a
credit
card
or
series
of
credit
cards
and
was
engaged
in
procuring
airline
tickets
or
in
the
ciotti
case,
kellerman
where
you
had
long
range
extensive
schemes
where
one
credit
card
after
another
was
used.
now,
also,
the
other
cases
that
upheld
use
of
the
mails
as
part
of
the
or
as
covered
under
mail
fraud
statute
have
involved
other
types
of
people,
businessmen
who
submitted
fraudulent
statements
for
the
purpose
of
getting
credit.
the
pereira
case,
a
very
sophisticated
person
who
as
the
court
knows
had
had
frauded
a
widow
over
a
long
period
of
time.
now,
it
is
possible.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
am
not
saying
or
arguing
this
morning
that
maze
didn’t
know
that
the
mails
would
be
used.
the
point
is
that
the
government
didn’t
prove
it.
now,
as
long
as
we’re
dealing
as
the
government
is
in
presuppositions
and
assumptions,
i
think
there
are
some
other
assumptions
that
could
just
as
recently
be
made.
that
maze
presumably
could
have
counted
on.
one,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
alluded
to
yesterday
and
that
is
the
chief
justice,
the
fact
that
the
vendors
themselves
might
for
some
reason
delay
a
week
or
ten
days
sending
in
their
invoices.
it’s
possible
that
maze
could
have
known
and
counted
on
the
fact
that
credit
card
issuer
such
as
the
banks
customarily
collects
statements
over
a
30-day
period.
now,
maze
first
went
to
california,
that
invoice
was
sent
in.
the
bank
didn’t
bill
him
meredith
right
away.
they
waited
until
the
end
of
the
month,
collected
all
his
invoices,
and
sent
them
out.
another
presupposition
which
could
be
indulged
in
this
case
is
that
maze
could
have
counted
on
the
fact
of
a
possible
breakdown
in
the
citizens
fidelity
banks
lost
card
or
stolen
card
procedure.
obviously,
it
may
take
ten
days
to
two
weeks
for
the
vendors
themselves
to
be
notified
and
in
this
case,
one
vendor
did
testify
that
it
took
three
weeks.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir
that’s
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
it
would
be.
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
would
point
in
that
regard,
dealing
with
such
a
presumption
to
the
recent
case
of
rewis
versus
the
united
states,
a
1971
case,
involving
the
travel
act.
and
there,
as
the
court
recalls,
a
gambler
or
a
person
running
a
gambling
establishment
in
florida
just
over
the
georgia
land
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
travel
act
and
the
basis
of
that
prosecution
was
that
he
could
reasonably
foresee
that
people
would
travel
interstate
from
georgia
to
patronize
his
gambling
establishment.
and
the
court
struck
down
that
presumption
and
raised
an
interesting
point
that
i
think
may
be
applicable
here.
they
stated
that
this
so
called
foreseeability
doctrine
which
is
present
in
the
maze
case
is
very
troublesome
when
it
applies
to
the
acts
of
others.
now,
in
the
--
with
regard
to
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
there
is
the
man
with
the
property,
he’s
got
it
in
his
hands.
now
in
the
rewis
case,
as
the
court
said,
i
think
correctly
in
that
case,
that
the
person
who
is
running
that
establishment
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
an
inference,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
your
honor,
on
the
--
on
the
presentation
of
some
evidence
to
the
jury,
there’s
some
proof
as
to
how
this
could
happen.
mr.
william
t.
warner
right.
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
i
feel
personally
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
a
holding
or
a
doctrine
which
went
the
--
totally
the
other
way
from
the
per
se
doctrine
in
credit
card
cases,
i
think
would
be
inappropriate
and
i
think
it’s
got
to
be
taken
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
what
we
are
in
effect
attacking
here
today
is
this
per
se
doctrine.
i
have
one
other
point
sir.
that
is
that
it
may
not
only
be
unreasonable,
but
i
think
in
view
of
the
existing
state
statute
since
it's
a
jurisdictional
problem,
which
i
want
to
get
to
shortly,
that
it
may
be
unnecessary.
now,
there’s
another
problem
again
responding
to
your
question
sir.
i
think
that
there
is
a
flaw
in
logic
here
somewhere.
the
government
says
that
because
the
defendant
in
this
case,
maze
intended
the
fraud
that
which
was
clearly
a
criminal
act,
and
the
jury
so
found
that
is
not
contested,
but
because
he
intended
the
criminal
act,
therefore,
he
intended
an
entirely
separate
criminal
act
which
is
the
use
of
the
mail
to
defraud.
and
in
my
view,
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court,
the
two
just
don’t
connect.
now,
the
second
point
that
maybe
and
certainly
is
we
feel
applicable
here
is
what
we
consider
to
be
an
unwarranted,
unnecessary
extension
of
federal
criminal
jurisdiction.
now,
it’s
an
elemental
principle
that
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
can
be
conferred
only
by
express
congressional
grant.
now,
this
principle
does
not
and
we
do
not
argue
here
this
morning,
prevent
the
courts
or
the
justice
department
in
any
way
from
a
reasonable
construction
of
a
criminal
statute,
but
in
this
case,
it’s
unnecessary
and
i’d
like
to
outline
why.
now,
in
two
recent
cases,
one
i
have
already
mentioned,
the
rewis
case
and
also
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
bass
which
was
also
a
1971
case,
the
court
enunciated
certain
policies.
now,
i
don’t
submit
that
these
cases
are
analogous
to
the
maze
case
because
both
of
those
cases
involved
a
single
statute.
here
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
there
are
in
effect
two
statutes
that
we
are
dealing
with,
but
the
court
there,
in
those
cases
stated
that
federal
jurisdiction
should
not
be
unnecessarily
injected
in
the
areas
which
would
affect
this
sensitive
state
federal
balance.
now,
the
policy
apparently
from
the
teaching
in
those
cases
is
that
without
a
clear
statement
from
the
congress
that
no
such
expansion
would
be
permitted
or
sanctioned.
now,
we
submit
in
this
case,
in
the
maze
case
that
there
has
been
such
a
clear
statement
by
congress
and
that
is
in
the
form
of
title
15,
section
1644.
now,
i
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
statute
which
is
set
forth
in
full
at
page
17
of
our
brief,
but
i
think
it’s
clear
from
that
legislative
history
as
recited
in
the
congressional
record
from
statements
and
remarks
made
by,
particularly
by
senator
long
on
the
florida
senate
that
the
court,
i’m
sorry,
the
congress
felt
that
there
was
no
adequate
protection
for
credit
card
fraud.
now,
there’s
one
other
significant
point
with
regard
to
the
enactment
of
this
legislation.
the
original
senate
bill
as
was
passed
was
section
134
of
title
5,
i
believe
of
the
truth
in
lending
act.
the
original
senate
bill
had
no
jurisdictional
limitation
other
than
the
interstate
commerce
requirement.
the
justice
department
came
in
and
said,
“we
want
a
$5,000
jurisdictional
limitation
in
this
because
of
the
administrative
problems
that
we
anticipate
encountering
in
administering
such
a
broadly
drawn
statute”
and
the
statute
was
subsequently
enacted
with
the
$5,000
requirement.
now,
i
think
it’s
clear,
again,
from
statement
or
policy
that
can
be
gleaned
from
a
recent
case
in
this
court,
the
erlenbaugh
decision
which
was
decided
a
little
less
than
a
year
ago,
erlenbaugh
against
united
states,
that
a
later
act
in
this
case
15
u.s.c.
1644,
can
to
a
great
extent
to
be
regarded
as
a
legislative
interpretation
of
an
earlier
act.
and
certainly
it’s,
i
think
a
well-settled
principle
of
statutory
construction
that
whenever
confess
passes
a
new
statute
it
acts
aware
of
all
previous
statutes
in
the
same
general
area.
now,
the
rewis
case
also
states,
expresses
this
court’s
concern
with
the
over
extension
of
limited
federal
police
resources.
and
i
think
it’s
ironic
in
this
case,
to
a
great
extent
that
the
justice
department
in
1970
in
urging
a
jurisdictional
limitation
upon
the
congress
expressed
almost
the
same
concern.
now,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
on
the
necessity
issue,
each
of
the
four
states
involved
has
a
specific
statute
dealing
with
credit
card
fraud.
the
state
of
kentucky
where
the
citizens
fidelity
bank
is
located
which
was
the
bank
that
ended
up
with
the
payment
in
this
case,
kentucky
has
probably
one
of
the
most
detailed
tough
credit
card
statutes
in
the
country
and
it
provides
for
misdemeanor
and
felony
penalties.
now
in
this
case,
maze
would
have
been
subjected
to
very
heavy
felony
penalties.
so
it's
not
a
question,
i
submit,
of
either
the
federal
government
entering
the
field
or
having
a
felon
escape
punishment,
this
is
not
the
case.
now,
there
has
been
no
showing
by
the
government
in
this
case
that
kentucky
officials,
louisville
police,
state
of
kentucky
are
either
unwilling
or
were
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
prosecute
maze
for
this
offense.
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
sir
the
postal
inspectors
acquired
the
evidence
in
this
case
from
the
citizens
fidelity
bank
and
i
could
only
assume
the
citizens
bank
would
have
responded
to
a
request
from
the
kentucky
police.
now,
that’s
where
the
evidence
ended
up.
that’s
where
the
invoices
were
and
that’s
where
all
the
evidence
was.
so
i
can
only
assume
that
it
would
have
been
no
more
difficulty
for
kentucky
police
than
for
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
sir
i’m
sure
they
would
have
been,
but
i
think
that
even
absent
that
consideration
that
the
state
investigative
facilities
could
have
gone
to
the
bank
and
said
we
want
to
see
the
same
records.
the
records
were
all
there,
right
in
louisville.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
understand
the
question.
mr.
william
t.
warner
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
they
were
from
other
states,
that’s
right.
this
was
done
not
infrequently
in
my
experience
in
kentucky
courts
that
out
of
state
witnesses
are
brought
in?
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
this
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
a
point
that
was
raised
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
chason
case
where
they
said
that
obviously,
the
interstate
character
and
i
think
that
is
valid
consideration.
but
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
alone
is
not
enough
to
warrant
federal
intrusion
into
this
kind
of
case.
now,
the
problem
is
and
i
think
it
was
raised
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
marshall
is
and
i
would
submit
for
the
court’s
consideration,
where
does
it
stop?
now,
i
raise
the
point
in
my
brief
that
if
the
government’s
position
is
sustained
and
the
per
se
rule
is
approved
or
expressed
as
policy
that
every
type
of
commercial
fraud
would
be
covered.
now,
i
since
learned
that
that’s
a
mistake.
i
want
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
an
indictment
returned
recently
in
the
united
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir?
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
no,
sir.
i’m
sorry,
i
have
a
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
--
it
was
decided
december
12,
1972.
i
don’t
have
the
u.s.
citation.
i
have
the
lawyer’s
edition
second.
but
as
an
example
of
the
kinds
of
cases
that
the
courts
will
face
and
this
court
will
face,
i
want
to
bring
to
your
attention
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
jasper
j.
mirabile
under
an
indictment
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
in
the
western
division.
its
number
73
cr
21060-4,
charging
of
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
1341
and
the
conduct
that
mr.
mirabile
is
charged
with
is
as
follows.
that
he
falsified
a
state
gross
receipts
tax
return
and
mailed
it
into
the
state
treasury
of
the
state
of
missouri,
and
the
defrauded
party
in
the
indictment
is
the
state
of
missouri,
stated
in
the
indictment
state
of
missouri.
now,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
that
constitutes
the
grossest
kind
of
overreaching
and
that
may
or
may
not
be
dismissed,
but
i
cited
as
an
example
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
could
be
or
may
be
possible
if
this
per
se
doctrine
is
not
struck
down.
now
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir
and
i
want
again
to
point
out
that
i’m
not
urging
on
the
court
the
view
that
the
use
of
a
credit
card
can
never
constitute
mail
fraud.
and
again,
i
would
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
no,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
have
some
doubts
about
that
by
reading
of
the
bass
case.
now,
i
just
don’t
know.
i’m
not
prepared
to
respond
to
that.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think,
now
you’re
assuming
that
the
interstate
commerce
requirement
would
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
there’s
no
question.
mr.
william
t.
warner
no
sir,
there’s
not
and
i
pointed
that
to
reinforce
my
argument
that
this
was
what
congress
did
intend
and
this
is
what
the
justice
department
asked
for
was
jurisdiction
only
in
cases
over
$5,000.
mr.
william
t.
warner
oh,
no,
sir.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
william
t.
warner
no,
they
could
be
carried
across
the
state
line
by
bicycle
or
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
that’s
right,
in
fact
similarly
transfer
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
that’s
a
very
valid
point
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
t.
warner
no,
sir.
nor
was
he
asked
any
questions
as
to
whether
he
had
used
the
mails
or
knew
that
the
mails
would
be
used.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i’m
sorry,
are
you
asking
if
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
that
he
caused
the
mails
to
be
used.
mr.
william
t.
warner
if
he
doesn’t
deposit
the
letter
himself,
the
statute
requires
that
he
caused
the
mails
to
be
used
in
some
way.
and
of
course
in
the
konashiki
(ph)
case
for
instance
where
the
life
insurance
agent
went
to
his
boss
and
filled
out
a
fraudulent
death
claim.
now,
he
was
in
the
business.
he
knew
that
his
boss
was
going
to
mail
that
application
to
the
home
office
because
he’d
mail
them
himself.
now,
this
is
where
we
think
the
maze
case
works.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
said,
i
thought
so,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
that’s
a
matter
of
proof,
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
and
perhaps
cases
like
it.
now
if
maze
as
an
example
had
been
asked
directly
the
question
on
cross-examination,
now
you
knew
that
that
vendor
would
mail
that
invoice
back
to
the
bank.
if
he
had
said
yes,
i
doubt
that
we
would
be
here
this
morning.
mr.
william
t.
warner
now,
one
other
final
point,
with
regard
to
a
point
or
question
that
was
raised
yesterday
by
mrs.
lafontant
about
this
business
of
concurrent
sentences
as
i
point
out
in
our
footnote
in
our
brief,
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
that
the
five-year
sentence
at
least
under
the
dyer
act
conviction
was
answered
by
the
four
convictions
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
if
this
conviction
or
the
sixth
circuit
decision
stands,
we
would
anticipate
a
motion
under
rule
35
to
district
court
for
reduction
of
sentence.
a
five-year
sentence
in
the
district
court
of
western
district
on
a
dyer
act
conviction
is
rather
unprecedented.
now
again,
the
government,
i
think
to
a
great
extent
in
this
case,
has
lit
off
a
kind
of
a
smoky
bonfire
on
this
issue
of
unless
the
court
overturns
the
sixth
circuit
decision
that
the
entire
credit
card
system
is
going
to
breakdown,
i
don’t
think
that’s
true.
i
think
their
adequate
state
laws
and
i
think
that
the
existing
federal
statutes
would
prevent
that.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
i’d
like
to
state
it’s
been
a
real
pleasure
and
fine
opportunity.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
respond
directly
to
several
points
and
contentions
raised
by
mrs.
lafontant,
but
with
the
court’s
indulgence
i
would
like
to
do
within
the
context
of
presenting
two
major
considerations
which
i
feel
are
important
and
are
before
the
court
this
morning
in
this
case.
now
the
first
is
the,
what
we
consider
to
be
other
failure
of
the
government’s
proof
upon
the
issue
of
knowing
use
of
the
mails
including
the
so
called
delay
issue.
the
second
point
is
the
reasonableness,
propriety,
and
or
the
necessity
of
extending
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
to
this
case
and
other
cases
similar
to
it.
now,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
it’s
possible.
i
think
in
this
case
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
submit
that
it
would
to
the
extent
that
as
mrs.
lafontant
pointed
out
the
ultimate
loser
in
terms
of
who
ended
up
with
the
paying
the
bill
in
this
case
was
the
citizens
fidelity
bank
in
louisville,
kentucky.
they
took
the
responsibility.
they
had
to
pay
these
invoices.
maze
was
caught
in
kentucky.
he
was
caught
30
miles
from
louisville
and
presumably
as
we
cover
in
our
brief
and
as
a
matter
of
record,
the
kentucky
statutes
are
more
than
adequate
to
cover
every
aspect
of
the
so
called
scheme
from
the
misappropriation
or
theft
to
the
credit
card
right
on
through
to
the
defrauding
of
the
bank.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case,
i
think
should
be
pointed
out
was
not
as
broadly
drawn
as
the
government
contends.
it
said
that
a
very
carefully
drawn
opinion
and
it
said
essentially
that
the
government
did
not
prove
in
this
case
by
the
evidence
of
record
that
maze
could
have
foreseen
or
knew
that
mails
would
be
used
or
that
the
mails
were
inescapably
direct
incident
between
the
defrauding
of
the
innkeepers
and
the
defrauding
of
the
bank.
now,
i
think
it’s
significant
to
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
well
sir,
in
this
case,
there
were
four
vendors
who
testified.
two
stated
that
they
customarily
used
them
in
the
mails.
they
dropped
them
in
the
mails
and
they
were
sent
in.
one
said
--
testified
that
they
went
through
bank
channels,
that
was
the
extent
of
this
testimony
and
one
vendor
i
believe
was
indefinite
or
stated
he
didn’t
know.
so
the
proof
was
not
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
this
is
a
question
in
this
case
that
some
of
the
circuits
have
raised
with
respect
to
charging
a
defendant
such
as
maze
with
a
detailed
knowledge
of
the
very
complex
and
intricate
commercial
scheme.
i
assume
that
the
mails
were
used.
i
would.
but
there
may
be
other
ways.
i
don’t
know
how
the
banks
transmit
matters
of
this
type
and
maybe
like
they
do
checks
through
the
mail.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
on
this
proof
issue,
i
think
it’s
significant
in
response
partially
to
a
question
that
you
addressed
to
mrs.
lafontant.
maze
did
testify
in
this
case.
in
other
way
testified,
in
his
own
behalf,
but
he
gave
a
statement
to
the
postal
inspector.
now,
neither
the
postal
inspectors
or
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
tried
the
case
addressed
one
single
question
to
maze
on
the
knowing
use
of
the
mails
or
did
he
know
or
did
he
contemplate
or
could
you
know.
in
order
the
government
introduced
any
other
witness
as
on
this
issue
as
to
how
the
mails
are
necessary
incident
of
this
type
of
fraud.
now,
also,
i
want
to
point
out
that
at
this
point,
that
the
government
contends
that
there
are
six
circuits
which
support
this
so
called
per
se
doctrine
that
the
fraudulent
use
of
a
credit
card
is
per
se
the
use
of
the
mails.
now,
if
my
reading
of
the
cases
does
not
support
this
view,
there
are
at
least
two
circuits,
the
fifth
certainly
in
the
adams
case
which
was
the
fundamental
case
on
the
per
se
doctrine
supports
this
view.
the
seventh
circuit
does
and
perhaps,
i
am
sorry,
the
second
circuit
in
the
kellerman
series
of
cases
and
most
recently
the
third
circuit
in
the
ciotti
case.
now,
the
other
cases
involved
varying
kinds
of
fraud.
and
as
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
isaac’s
case
in
1968
that
the
forms
of
fraud
which
are
possible
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
are
multifarious
as
human
ingenuity
can
device,
and
i
think
that
this
should
be
kept
in
mind.
now,
the
government
case
on
the
knowing
use
of
the
mails
issue,
we
submit
is
built
on
a
series
of
presuppositions
and
assumptions.
now,
it’s
long
been
the
rule
under
our
system
of
jurisprudence
that
we
don’t
convict
people
upon
presuppositions
and
assumptions,
and
that
this
as
were
partially
at
least
where
the
government
case
failed.
now,
as
i
stated
earlier
in
response
to
chief
justice’s
question,
the
trouble
with
the
per
se
doctrine,
that
is
the
doctrine
that
the
fraudulent
presentation
and/or
use
of
the
credit
card
per
se
involves
the
mail
is
that
this
imposes
on
the
defendant
a
detailed
knowledge
of
a
very
complex
commercial
mechanism.
and
again,
there
is
no
proof
in
this
record
in
this
case.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
stated
specifically
that
they
were
not
holding
that
credit
card
abuse
could
never
constitute
mail
fraud.
they
stated
in
this
case,
in
this
case
that
the
government’s
proof
had
failed.
now,
with
regard
to
the
alleged
scheme,
i
think
the
facts
are
significant
here.
the
card
was
misappropriated
stolen
on
april
10,
1971.
now,
maze
was
arrested
and
in
jail
on
may
9,
1971.
now,
there
was
no
extensive
long
range
scheme
such
as
the
one
in
the
chason
case
which
is
the
second
circuit
case
involving
a
man
who
obtained
a
credit
card
or
series
of
credit
cards
and
was
engaged
in
procuring
airline
tickets
or
in
the
ciotti
case,
kellerman
where
you
had
long
range
extensive
schemes
where
one
credit
card
after
another
was
used.
now,
also,
the
other
cases
that
upheld
use
of
the
mails
as
part
of
the
or
as
covered
under
mail
fraud
statute
have
involved
other
types
of
people,
businessmen
who
submitted
fraudulent
statements
for
the
purpose
of
getting
credit.
the
pereira
case,
a
very
sophisticated
person
who
as
the
court
knows
had
had
frauded
a
widow
over
a
long
period
of
time.
now,
it
is
possible.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
am
not
saying
or
arguing
this
morning
that
maze
didn’t
know
that
the
mails
would
be
used.
the
point
is
that
the
government
didn’t
prove
it.
now,
as
long
as
we’re
dealing
as
the
government
is
in
presuppositions
and
assumptions,
i
think
there
are
some
other
assumptions
that
could
just
as
recently
be
made.
that
maze
presumably
could
have
counted
on.
one,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
alluded
to
yesterday
and
that
is
the
chief
justice,
the
fact
that
the
vendors
themselves
might
for
some
reason
delay
a
week
or
ten
days
sending
in
their
invoices.
it’s
possible
that
maze
could
have
known
and
counted
on
the
fact
that
credit
card
issuer
such
as
the
banks
customarily
collects
statements
over
a
30-day
period.
now,
maze
first
went
to
california,
that
invoice
was
sent
in.
the
bank
didn’t
bill
him
meredith
right
away.
they
waited
until
the
end
of
the
month,
collected
all
his
invoices,
and
sent
them
out.
another
presupposition
which
could
be
indulged
in
this
case
is
that
maze
could
have
counted
on
the
fact
of
a
possible
breakdown
in
the
citizens
fidelity
banks
lost
card
or
stolen
card
procedure.
obviously,
it
may
take
ten
days
to
two
weeks
for
the
vendors
themselves
to
be
notified
and
in
this
case,
one
vendor
did
testify
that
it
took
three
weeks.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir
that’s
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
it
would
be.
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
would
point
in
that
regard,
dealing
with
such
a
presumption
to
the
recent
case
of
rewis
versus
the
united
states,
a
1971
case,
involving
the
travel
act.
and
there,
as
the
court
recalls,
a
gambler
or
a
person
running
a
gambling
establishment
in
florida
just
over
the
georgia
land
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
travel
act
and
the
basis
of
that
prosecution
was
that
he
could
reasonably
foresee
that
people
would
travel
interstate
from
georgia
to
patronize
his
gambling
establishment.
and
the
court
struck
down
that
presumption
and
raised
an
interesting
point
that
i
think
may
be
applicable
here.
they
stated
that
this
so
called
foreseeability
doctrine
which
is
present
in
the
maze
case
is
very
troublesome
when
it
applies
to
the
acts
of
others.
now,
in
the
--
with
regard
to
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
there
is
the
man
with
the
property,
he’s
got
it
in
his
hands.
now
in
the
rewis
case,
as
the
court
said,
i
think
correctly
in
that
case,
that
the
person
who
is
running
that
establishment
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
an
inference,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
your
honor,
on
the
--
on
the
presentation
of
some
evidence
to
the
jury,
there’s
some
proof
as
to
how
this
could
happen.
mr.
william
t.
warner
right.
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
i
feel
personally
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
a
holding
or
a
doctrine
which
went
the
--
totally
the
other
way
from
the
per
se
doctrine
in
credit
card
cases,
i
think
would
be
inappropriate
and
i
think
it’s
got
to
be
taken
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
what
we
are
in
effect
attacking
here
today
is
this
per
se
doctrine.
i
have
one
other
point
sir.
that
is
that
it
may
not
only
be
unreasonable,
but
i
think
in
view
of
the
existing
state
statute
since
it's
a
jurisdictional
problem,
which
i
want
to
get
to
shortly,
that
it
may
be
unnecessary.
now,
there’s
another
problem
again
responding
to
your
question
sir.
i
think
that
there
is
a
flaw
in
logic
here
somewhere.
the
government
says
that
because
the
defendant
in
this
case,
maze
intended
the
fraud
that
which
was
clearly
a
criminal
act,
and
the
jury
so
found
that
is
not
contested,
but
because
he
intended
the
criminal
act,
therefore,
he
intended
an
entirely
separate
criminal
act
which
is
the
use
of
the
mail
to
defraud.
and
in
my
view,
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court,
the
two
just
don’t
connect.
now,
the
second
point
that
maybe
and
certainly
is
we
feel
applicable
here
is
what
we
consider
to
be
an
unwarranted,
unnecessary
extension
of
federal
criminal
jurisdiction.
now,
it’s
an
elemental
principle
that
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
can
be
conferred
only
by
express
congressional
grant.
now,
this
principle
does
not
and
we
do
not
argue
here
this
morning,
prevent
the
courts
or
the
justice
department
in
any
way
from
a
reasonable
construction
of
a
criminal
statute,
but
in
this
case,
it’s
unnecessary
and
i’d
like
to
outline
why.
now,
in
two
recent
cases,
one
i
have
already
mentioned,
the
rewis
case
and
also
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
bass
which
was
also
a
1971
case,
the
court
enunciated
certain
policies.
now,
i
don’t
submit
that
these
cases
are
analogous
to
the
maze
case
because
both
of
those
cases
involved
a
single
statute.
here
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
there
are
in
effect
two
statutes
that
we
are
dealing
with,
but
the
court
there,
in
those
cases
stated
that
federal
jurisdiction
should
not
be
unnecessarily
injected
in
the
areas
which
would
affect
this
sensitive
state
federal
balance.
now,
the
policy
apparently
from
the
teaching
in
those
cases
is
that
without
a
clear
statement
from
the
congress
that
no
such
expansion
would
be
permitted
or
sanctioned.
now,
we
submit
in
this
case,
in
the
maze
case
that
there
has
been
such
a
clear
statement
by
congress
and
that
is
in
the
form
of
title
15,
section
1644.
now,
i
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
statute
which
is
set
forth
in
full
at
page
17
of
our
brief,
but
i
think
it’s
clear
from
that
legislative
history
as
recited
in
the
congressional
record
from
statements
and
remarks
made
by,
particularly
by
senator
long
on
the
florida
senate
that
the
court,
i’m
sorry,
the
congress
felt
that
there
was
no
adequate
protection
for
credit
card
fraud.
now,
there’s
one
other
significant
point
with
regard
to
the
enactment
of
this
legislation.
the
original
senate
bill
as
was
passed
was
section
134
of
title
5,
i
believe
of
the
truth
in
lending
act.
the
original
senate
bill
had
no
jurisdictional
limitation
other
than
the
interstate
commerce
requirement.
the
justice
department
came
in
and
said,
“we
want
a
$5,000
jurisdictional
limitation
in
this
because
of
the
administrative
problems
that
we
anticipate
encountering
in
administering
such
a
broadly
drawn
statute”
and
the
statute
was
subsequently
enacted
with
the
$5,000
requirement.
now,
i
think
it’s
clear,
again,
from
statement
or
policy
that
can
be
gleaned
from
a
recent
case
in
this
court,
the
erlenbaugh
decision
which
was
decided
a
little
less
than
a
year
ago,
erlenbaugh
against
united
states,
that
a
later
act
in
this
case
15
u.s.c.
1644,
can
to
a
great
extent
to
be
regarded
as
a
legislative
interpretation
of
an
earlier
act.
and
certainly
it’s,
i
think
a
well-settled
principle
of
statutory
construction
that
whenever
confess
passes
a
new
statute
it
acts
aware
of
all
previous
statutes
in
the
same
general
area.
now,
the
rewis
case
also
states,
expresses
this
court’s
concern
with
the
over
extension
of
limited
federal
police
resources.
and
i
think
it’s
ironic
in
this
case,
to
a
great
extent
that
the
justice
department
in
1970
in
urging
a
jurisdictional
limitation
upon
the
congress
expressed
almost
the
same
concern.
now,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
on
the
necessity
issue,
each
of
the
four
states
involved
has
a
specific
statute
dealing
with
credit
card
fraud.
the
state
of
kentucky
where
the
citizens
fidelity
bank
is
located
which
was
the
bank
that
ended
up
with
the
payment
in
this
case,
kentucky
has
probably
one
of
the
most
detailed
tough
credit
card
statutes
in
the
country
and
it
provides
for
misdemeanor
and
felony
penalties.
now
in
this
case,
maze
would
have
been
subjected
to
very
heavy
felony
penalties.
so
it's
not
a
question,
i
submit,
of
either
the
federal
government
entering
the
field
or
having
a
felon
escape
punishment,
this
is
not
the
case.
now,
there
has
been
no
showing
by
the
government
in
this
case
that
kentucky
officials,
louisville
police,
state
of
kentucky
are
either
unwilling
or
were
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
prosecute
maze
for
this
offense.
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
sir
the
postal
inspectors
acquired
the
evidence
in
this
case
from
the
citizens
fidelity
bank
and
i
could
only
assume
the
citizens
bank
would
have
responded
to
a
request
from
the
kentucky
police.
now,
that’s
where
the
evidence
ended
up.
that’s
where
the
invoices
were
and
that’s
where
all
the
evidence
was.
so
i
can
only
assume
that
it
would
have
been
no
more
difficulty
for
kentucky
police
than
for
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
sir
i’m
sure
they
would
have
been,
but
i
think
that
even
absent
that
consideration
that
the
state
investigative
facilities
could
have
gone
to
the
bank
and
said
we
want
to
see
the
same
records.
the
records
were
all
there,
right
in
louisville.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i’m
sorry,
i
didn’t
understand
the
question.
mr.
william
t.
warner
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
they
were
from
other
states,
that’s
right.
this
was
done
not
infrequently
in
my
experience
in
kentucky
courts
that
out
of
state
witnesses
are
brought
in?
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
this
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
a
point
that
was
raised
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
chason
case
where
they
said
that
obviously,
the
interstate
character
and
i
think
that
is
valid
consideration.
but
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
alone
is
not
enough
to
warrant
federal
intrusion
into
this
kind
of
case.
now,
the
problem
is
and
i
think
it
was
raised
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
marshall
is
and
i
would
submit
for
the
court’s
consideration,
where
does
it
stop?
now,
i
raise
the
point
in
my
brief
that
if
the
government’s
position
is
sustained
and
the
per
se
rule
is
approved
or
expressed
as
policy
that
every
type
of
commercial
fraud
would
be
covered.
now,
i
since
learned
that
that’s
a
mistake.
i
want
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
an
indictment
returned
recently
in
the
united
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir?
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
no,
sir.
i’m
sorry,
i
have
a
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
--
it
was
decided
december
12,
1972.
i
don’t
have
the
u.s.
citation.
i
have
the
lawyer’s
edition
second.
but
as
an
example
of
the
kinds
of
cases
that
the
courts
will
face
and
this
court
will
face,
i
want
to
bring
to
your
attention
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
jasper
j.
mirabile
under
an
indictment
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
in
the
western
division.
its
number
73
cr
21060-4,
charging
of
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
1341
and
the
conduct
that
mr.
mirabile
is
charged
with
is
as
follows.
that
he
falsified
a
state
gross
receipts
tax
return
and
mailed
it
into
the
state
treasury
of
the
state
of
missouri,
and
the
defrauded
party
in
the
indictment
is
the
state
of
missouri,
stated
in
the
indictment
state
of
missouri.
now,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
that
constitutes
the
grossest
kind
of
overreaching
and
that
may
or
may
not
be
dismissed,
but
i
cited
as
an
example
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
could
be
or
may
be
possible
if
this
per
se
doctrine
is
not
struck
down.
now
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir
and
i
want
again
to
point
out
that
i’m
not
urging
on
the
court
the
view
that
the
use
of
a
credit
card
can
never
constitute
mail
fraud.
and
again,
i
would
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
no,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
have
some
doubts
about
that
by
reading
of
the
bass
case.
now,
i
just
don’t
know.
i’m
not
prepared
to
respond
to
that.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think,
now
you’re
assuming
that
the
interstate
commerce
requirement
would
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
there’s
no
question.
mr.
william
t.
warner
no
sir,
there’s
not
and
i
pointed
that
to
reinforce
my
argument
that
this
was
what
congress
did
intend
and
this
is
what
the
justice
department
asked
for
was
jurisdiction
only
in
cases
over
$5,000.
mr.
william
t.
warner
oh,
no,
sir.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
william
t.
warner
no,
they
could
be
carried
across
the
state
line
by
bicycle
or
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
that’s
right,
in
fact
similarly
transfer
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
that’s
a
very
valid
point
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
t.
warner
no,
sir.
nor
was
he
asked
any
questions
as
to
whether
he
had
used
the
mails
or
knew
that
the
mails
would
be
used.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i’m
sorry,
are
you
asking
if
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
that
he
caused
the
mails
to
be
used.
mr.
william
t.
warner
if
he
doesn’t
deposit
the
letter
himself,
the
statute
requires
that
he
caused
the
mails
to
be
used
in
some
way.
and
of
course
in
the
konashiki
(ph)
case
for
instance
where
the
life
insurance
agent
went
to
his
boss
and
filled
out
a
fraudulent
death
claim.
now,
he
was
in
the
business.
he
knew
that
his
boss
was
going
to
mail
that
application
to
the
home
office
because
he’d
mail
them
himself.
now,
this
is
where
we
think
the
maze
case
works.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
said,
i
thought
so,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
i
think
that’s
a
matter
of
proof,
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
and
perhaps
cases
like
it.
now
if
maze
as
an
example
had
been
asked
directly
the
question
on
cross-examination,
now
you
knew
that
that
vendor
would
mail
that
invoice
back
to
the
bank.
if
he
had
said
yes,
i
doubt
that
we
would
be
here
this
morning.
mr.
william
t.
warner
now,
one
other
final
point,
with
regard
to
a
point
or
question
that
was
raised
yesterday
by
mrs.
lafontant
about
this
business
of
concurrent
sentences
as
i
point
out
in
our
footnote
in
our
brief,
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
that
the
five-year
sentence
at
least
under
the
dyer
act
conviction
was
answered
by
the
four
convictions
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
if
this
conviction
or
the
sixth
circuit
decision
stands,
we
would
anticipate
a
motion
under
rule
35
to
district
court
for
reduction
of
sentence.
a
five-year
sentence
in
the
district
court
of
western
district
on
a
dyer
act
conviction
is
rather
unprecedented.
now
again,
the
government,
i
think
to
a
great
extent
in
this
case,
has
lit
off
a
kind
of
a
smoky
bonfire
on
this
issue
of
unless
the
court
overturns
the
sixth
circuit
decision
that
the
entire
credit
card
system
is
going
to
breakdown,
i
don’t
think
that’s
true.
i
think
their
adequate
state
laws
and
i
think
that
the
existing
federal
statutes
would
prevent
that.
mr.
william
t.
warner
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
t.
warner
well,
i’d
like
to
state
it’s
been
a
real
pleasure
and
fine
opportunity.
thank
you,
sir.
