ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
following
a
jury
trial,
respondent
maze
was
convicted
of
four
counts
of
using
the
mails
to
defraud
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.,
section
1341,
and
of
one
count
of
knowingly
transporting
a
stolen
automobile
in
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
the
dyer
act.
he
was
sentenced
to
concurrent
terms
of
five
years
imprisonment
on
each
count.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
conviction
for
mail
fraud,
but
affirmed
the
dyer
act
conviction,
which
is
not
here
in
issue
now.
the
united
states'
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court,
reversing
the
conviction
of
the
four
counts
of
mail
fraud.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
that’s
true.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
concurrent
sentences,
five
years
each,
one
on
the
dyer
act
and
on
the
four
counts
of
mail
fraud
and
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
the
mail
fraud
count.
the
dyer
act
conviction
was
sustained
by
judge
mccree.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
sir.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true.
benton
versus
maryland
changed
that,
so
we’re
practically
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
right,
your
honor.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
correct.
he
will
be
serving
five
years
imprisonment
no
matter
what
this
court
does,
but,
it
will
have
an
effect
on
the
law
of
the
land
as
far
as
this
particular
issue
is
concerned
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
and
also
because
we
have
--
i’m
sorry,
mr.
justice.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
that’s
certainly
true
and
it’s
important
that
this
case
be
determined
here
because
we
do
have
a
division
in
the
circuits.
although
six
of
our
circuits
agree
with
the
government’s
position
is,
one
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
that
is
opposite
and,
of
course,
the
present
one
is
before
you
today.
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
government
did
not
show
that
the
mails
were
used
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraudulent
scheme.
but
that
respondent’s
transaction
was
completed
after
he
received
the
goods
and
services
from
each
motel
and
that
the
subsequent
billing
was
merely
incidental
and
collateral
to
the
scheme
and
not
a
part
of
it.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
use
of
the
mails
that
was
charged
in
the
indictment
and
shown
by
the
evidence
practically
may
be
said
to
have
been,
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraudulent
scheme,
in
violation
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
the
government
says
yes.
the
respondent
says
no.
for
a
period
of
two
months,
ending
in
april
of
1971,
the
respondent
lived
with
one
meredith
in
louisville,
kentucky
in
meredith’s
apartment.
he
stole
from
meredith’s
apartment
a
bankamericard
belonging
to
meredith,
all
of
his
identification,
including
his
wallet,
and
he
also
took
from
him
a
1968
pontiac
tempus
automobile
and
other
personal
items.
between
april
15
and
19
of
that
same
year,
he
used
this
credit
card
to
purchase
goods
and
services
from
merchants
in
california,
louisiana,
and
florida,
all
the
time
representing
himself
as
being
meredith.
for
example,
as
charged
in
the
indictment,
on
april
17,
he
charged
over
$88
at
the
sheraton
beach
inn
in
bennington
beach,
california.
and
just
two
days
thereafter,
he
charged
over
$96
at
the
sheraton
inn
in
san
diego,
california.
the
following
week,
he
made
charges
of
over
$62
at
the
quality
motel
capri
in
new
orleans,
louisiana
and
three
days
thereafter,
at
the
holiday
inn
in
fort
lauderdale,
florida,
he
ran
up
a
bill
of
over
$54.
subsequent
to
this,
the
citizens
national
bank
of
louisville,
kentucky
which
was
the
issuer
of
the
credit
card
received
by
mail
copies
of
the
purchase
invoices
representing
these
transactions
and
requesting
reimbursement.
such
invoices,
according
to
usual
business
practice,
were
customarily
mailed
to
the
bank
and
then
mailed
monthly
to
the
card
holder
with
the
bill
for
his
total
purchases.
one
hotel
owner
testified
that
they
are
delayed
for
two
or
three
weeks
or
even
longer
before
merchants
are
advised
that
a
particular
credit
card
is
being
used
fraudulently.
when
the
respondent
left
louisville,
kentucky
in
meredith’s
pontiac,
he
drove
to
several
states.
the
first
one
is
indianapolis,
indiana,
from
there
to
st.
louis,
missouri
and
to
florida.
he
went
to
california
and
to
new
orleans
and
he
finally
ended
up
in
knoxville,
tennessee
where
the
car
developed
transmission
trouble.
at
that
time,
he
had
his
car
towed
in
by
the
amco
people
down
there,
who
took
the
car
to
their
garage
to
service
it.
and
while
he
was
there,
he
borrowed
from
the
amco
people
another
car,
a
‘64
chevrolet.
he
told
them
that
he
needed
that
car
to
go
to
a
motel
to
stay
for
the
night
and
then
he
would
return
the
next
day
to
get
his
car.
he
never
returned.
he
was
found
two
days
later
in
a
semi-conscious
condition
in
kentucky
in
a
hit-and-run
accident
and
as
a
result
of
that,
he
was
charged
with
drunken
driving
and
leaving
the
scene
of
an
accident,
but
it’s
this
amco
car
that
is
the
subject
of
the
dyer
act
conviction.
now,
in
addition
to
the
dyer
act
charge,
the
respondent
was
indicted
on
four
counts
of
mail
fraud.
the
indictment
alleged
that
he
had
devised
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
kentucky
bank,
to
defraud
meredith,
the
card
holder,
and
merchants
by
using
the
bankamericard
without
authorization
and
falsely
securing
credit
from
persons
who
had
agreements
with
bankamericard
to
furnish
goods
and
services
on
credit
to
cardholders
and,
of
course,
on
the
condition
that
payment
would
be
made
when
due.
the
indictment
alleged
that
the
use
of
the
mails
was
also
part
of
the
scheme.
we
all
realize
that
in
the
last
decade,
one
of
the
most
significant
commercial
developments
have
come
about
--
has
come
about
and
that
is
the
emergence
of
the
credit
card
as
a
substitute
for
cash.
inherent
in
the
three-part
type
of
credit
card
system,
we
submit,
is
the
use
of
the
mails.
the
use
of
the
mails
is
a
necessary
and
essential
feature
of
the
collection
in
the
billing
systems
and
in
the
processing
of
the
sales
invoices.
it
is
common
knowledge
and
i
believe
anyone
over
21,
like
respondent
who
was
31,
to
charge
to
collect
goods
with
the
credit
card
knows
that,
first,
the
card
is
a
national
card.
he
knows
too
that
the
invoices
must
be
sent
to
the
card
issuing
company
and
in
many
instances,
that’s
across
state
lines,
for
payment
and
then
to
the
owner.
in
pereira,
this
court
established
a
broad
test
for
determining
whether
a
defendant,
in
setting
in
motion
a
chain
of
events
which
results
in
the
use
of
the
mails
by
another,
has
caused
a
mailing
within
the
meaning
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
and
the
court
held
in
pereira,
“where
one
doesn’t
act
with
knowledge
that
the
use
of
the
mails
will
follow
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
or
where
such
use
can
reasonably
be
foreseen
even
though
not
actually
intended,
then
he
causes
the
mails
to
be
used.”
but
the
sixth
circuit
already
has
conceded
the
respondent
had
caused
the
mailing
of
the
purchase
receipts
to
the
louisville
bank
from
the
motel
in
the
sense
that
the
court
said
that
he
should
reasonably
have
foreseen
that
this
use
of
the
mails
would
necessarily
occur.
but
it,
nevertheless,
held
that
these
mailings
were
not
a
significant
factor
in
the
success
of
the
scheme.
we
respectfully
submit
that
these
mailings
were
an
integral
part
of
the
respondent’s
scheme
because
with
the
delay
caused
by
the
mails,
it
enabled
him
to
go
on
longer
with
the
scheme
and
enabled
him
to
avoid
detection.
at
the
core
of
any
successful
credit
card
scheme
or
any
credit
card
involving
a
single
illegal
purchase
is
the
necessary
delay
in
detecting
the
fraud.
the
respondent
should
reasonably
have
foreseen
that
the
use
of
the
mails
would
prevented
apprehension
than
being
immediate
anyway.
and
detection
effort
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
would
be
delayed.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
a
merchant
not
to
turn
in
the
invoice,
but
i
would
certainly
say
that
if
it
had
not
been
turned
in,
then
we
wouldn’t
have
a
mail
fraud
violation
because
you
have
to
have
the
use
of
the
mail.
now
whether
they
could’ve
gotten
the
invoices
over
there
by
some
other
means
is
really
not
before
us,
but
i
would
say
if
any
other
means
was
chosen,
then
there
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
but,
wouldn’t
you
agree
though
that
by
having
to
use
the
mails
to
even
notify
the
louisville
bank,
they
gave
him
another
day?
by
the
next
day,
he’d
gone
to
another
state
so
that
even
if
he
just
had
the
delay
of
one
day
caused
by
the
mail,
it
would
bring
it
still
within
the
statute.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
in
this
case,
it
would
be
the
result
of
the
mail
because
the
mail
was
used.
now,
whether
it
was
mailed
within
the
same
state
or
across
state
lines
or
--
isn’t
really
the
point
at
issue
because
even
if
it
were
mailed
within
the
same
state,
it
would
take
a
day
and
he
would
be
on
his
way
to
the
next
jurisdiction.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
we
have
many
cases,
your
honor,
concerning
what
forged
checks
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
where
forged
checks
have
been
found
to
be
--
the
mail
fraud
statute
has
been
violated
where
a
forged
check
had
been
sent
through
the
mail
and
the
mail
has
been
used,
if
they
can
show
that
by
the
use
of
the
mails
was
more
than
incidental,
but
played
an
integral
part
in
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
i
would
say
if
he
could
foresee
the
use
of
the
mail
in
this
instance,
he
has
violated
it
in
this
case
too.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
the
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
the
main
person
that
was
defrauded
was
the
issuer
of
the
card,
but
also
the
person
he
stole
the
card
from
was
defrauded
too
because
he
had
to
pay
up
to
$50
to
bankamericard
for
--
well,
he
would’ve
had
to
pay
it
if
he
had
been
notified
on
time,
i
think
in
this
case
he
was
not,
he
didn’t
have
to
pay
it.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
you
had
what?
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
you
wouldn’t
see
it
as
part
of
the
whole
scheme
to
defraud
the
charge
at
issue
or
that
he
had
to
use
meredith
too.
but,
i
think
you
are
right
that
the
crime
against
meredith
would
be
larceny
or
embezzlement,
yes.
the
decision
in
the
parr
case,
decided
by
this
court,
upon
which
the
respondent
relies,
that
decision
did
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
once
defendant
has
obtained
that
which
he
had
gotten
fraudulently
and
has
set
out
to
obtain,
once
he
has
gotten
that,
it
doesn’t
hold
that
no
subsequent
mailing
could
form
the
basis
of
a
mail
fraud
prosecution.
in
the
parr
case,
the
essence
of
the
fraud
lay
in
the
abuse
of
the
petitioner’s
position.
in
that
instance,
which
we
may
all
remember
is
the
petitioner
and
several
other
people
who
were
trustees
and
on
the
board
and
also
who
had
certain
jobs
with
this
particular
corporation
took
from
the
corporation
or
bought
on
the
corporation’s
credit
gasoline
with
its
credit
card.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
thank
you.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
develop
a
little
more,
the
theory
expressed
yesterday
afternoon
that
this
case
involves
the
substantial
use
of
the
mails
or
the
use
of
the
mails
is
as
stated
in
pereira
incident
to
an
essential
part
of
the
scheme.
it
is
significant
to
the
respondent
when
on
a
cross
country
frolic
representing
himself
as
one
meredith
to
obtain
goods
and
services,
well
knowing
that
the
issuer
of
the
card
would
not
learn
of
the
fraudulent
scheme
until
the
purchase
invoices
which
within
the
use
of
business
practices
would
be
mailed
from
the
merchant
to
the
card
issuer.
and
according
to
the
testimony,
one
hotel
owner
as
a
delay
of
two
or
three
weeks
and
often
longer
before
the
merchants
learned
that
the
particular
credit
card
is
being
used
fraudulently.
there
is
no
doubt
from
the
record
that
this
respondent
used
the
mails
in
that
fashion.
there’s
no
doubt
that
upon
receipt
of
the
invoices
through
the
mails,
discovery
of
respondent’s
fraud
would
be
uncovered.
however,
if
the
card
issuer
was
present
with
the
merchant
when
the
respondent
presented
the
credit
card,
he
would
have
been
discovered
immediately,
and
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
it’s
inherent
in
the
credit
card
system
and
without
it
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
perpetrate
this
kind
of
fraud.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
right
the
fact
that
he
selected
it
isn’t
too
important
practice
that
has
caused
his
activity
created
the
cause
of
action
which
included
the
use
of
the
mails
which
was
a
pertinent
part,
an
essential
part
in
and
of
credit
card
scheme.
and
as
you’ve
indicated
mr.
chief
justice,
the
fact
the
mails
were
used
delayed
his
detection.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
he
did
testify
your
honor
and
he
admitted
the
use
of
the
credit
card.
he
admitted
that
bankamericard
belonged
to
meredith
and
that
he
had
taken
it
but
he
said
that
he
had
permission
to
use
the
credit
card,
as
well
as
permission
to
use
the
automobile.
but
with
all
the
evidence
that
was
adduced,
the
jury
did
not
believe
him
and
found
otherwise.
in
fact,
judge
mccree
of
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
the
evidence
was
overwhelming.
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
by
the
government
was
overwhelming
to
show
that
this
was
a
fraud
and
that
he
actually
did
not
have
permission
to
use
the
credit
card.
now,
this
case
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
i
would
assume
that
they
were
paid.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
no,
i
believe
the
ultimate
loss
would
have
been
with
the
citizens
national
bank
in
louisville,
kentucky
who
issued
the
card.
the
merchants
initially
were
out
of
their
merchandise
but
the
bankamericard
has
to
reimbursed
them.
so,
the
ultimate
true
victim
would
have
been
the
card
issuer
who
does
not
get
paid
because
even
the
cardholder
is
only
obligated
up
to
$50
and
in
some
instances
it’s
not
bad
if
he
has
dutifully
notified
the
card
issuer
that
his
card
has
been
stolen.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
in
this
case,
he
didn’t
do
that.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
certainly.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
i
interpret
this
fraudulent
scheme
as
beginning
with
the
idea
of
perpetrating
a
fraudulent
scheme
and
initially,
the
innkeepers
were
defrauded.
all
the
other
things
were
steps
in
following
that
including
a
cardholder
taking
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
taking
the
cards
from
him
and
misrepresentation
in
the
first
place.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
the
cardholder
himself
was
not
actually
defrauded
but
was
all
part
of
one
fraudulent
scheme.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
certainly.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true,
your
honor.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
he
had
defrauded
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
up
to
that
point,
that’s
right.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
without
having
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
[laughter
attempt]
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
will
agree
with
that.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
especially
as
to
the
first
count
if
he
turned
in
the
card
and
got
the
credit
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
and
there
was
no
use
of
the
mails.
it
would
have
ended
right
there.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
right.
but
that
is
not
our
case
in
that
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
i
would
be
willing
to
even
go
further
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
if
the
use
of
the
mails
were
not
involved
i
would
agree
with
that.
but
if
the
use
of
the
mails
were
involved
even
with
the
one
transaction,
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
would
be
violative
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
but
that’s
not
our
case.
our
argument
here
too
is
although
there
are
four
separate
counts,
we
consider
this
as
one
unitary
scheme
developed
from
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
five
years
each.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
hand-delivery.
i
agree
with
you.
right,
that
if
the
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
correct.
very
definitely.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
mr.
justice
powell?
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
i
would
say
that
he
could
have
brought
--
the
bank
could
have
brought
a
civil
action
against
maze,
the
respondent
here.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
right
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
analogous
situation.
i
believe
that
the
bank
could
have
brought
a
civil
action
against
the
respondent.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
in
fact,
it
may
have
been
--
it
would
have
been
a
few
left
for
them,
i’m
afraid,
because
he
--
one
reason
he
was
living
with
meredith
in
the
first
instance
was
that
he
had
no
job
and
suppose
he
was
looking
for
employment.
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is
very
definitely
the
bank
could
have
brought
a
civil
action
against
him.
this
case
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
right.
in
the
1970
amendment,
the
law
states
that
credit
card,
the
misuse
or
unauthorized
use
of
credit
cards
in
excess
of
$5,000
is
punishable.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
no,
and
--
no,
it
doesn’t.
it’s
just
that
the
department
of
justice
in
many
of
these
cases
has
not
prosecuted
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
as
such
but
even
where
they
do
it
has
to
be
one
of
interstate
commerce
as
this
case.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
i
don’t
know
the
real
interpretation
of
that
but
i
would
interpret
important
as
an
ongoing
scheme
more
than
one
little
act
of
a
felon
that
might
go
and
forge
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
no,
not
at
all
and
of
course
it’s
been
well-settled
that
one
act
can
violate
two
statutes
and
these
statutes
are
not
conflicting
in
any
way.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
from
reading
the
congressional
record,
mr.
justice
white,
i
gather
that
because
as
credit
card
business
had
just
mushroomed
so
quickly
and
banks
were
sending
cards
out
all
over
the
country
even
without
people
requesting
them
and
that
there
was
beginning
to
be
such
a
problem.
the
congress
addressed
itself
to
the
problem
to
make
sure
that
anyone
who
misused
a
card
would
be
punished.
they
made
it
for
$5,000.
i
think
senator
proxmire
had
said
that
he
talked
with
the
justice
department
and
they
had
suggested
using
the
figure
$5,000
because
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
oversee
all
of
the
credit
card
cases
under
this
section.
it
doesn’t
rule
out
the
mail
fraud
section
because
you
could
be
guilty
of
the
1970
amendment
act
and
also
mail
fraud
if
it
exceeded
$5,000.
but
the
people
under
$5,000,
we
contend,
are
still
covered
by
mail
fraud
because
even
though
they
passed
this
new
law,
there’s
nothing
in
conflict.
there’s
no
talk
of
repealing
the
earlier
law
and
i
don’t’
think
we
can
repeal
the
law
by
inference
or
implication
or
what
we
think
went
on
in
the
minds
of
the
lawmakers
at
that
time.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
that’s
true
and
then
just
the
unauthorized
use
is
efficient.
so
it’s
broader
in
the
sense
although
it’s
limited
because
of
the
$5,000
figure.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
no,
i
don’t.
all
i
can
say
is
there’s
nothing
in
the
congressional
record
to
indicate
that
they
knew
that
there
are
any
cases
thought.
we’ve
had
at
least
13
cases
involving
the
mail
fraud
statute,
most
of
them
before
1970.
so
that
they
should
have
been
aware
of
it
but
there
was
no
mention
of
it
and
the
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes.
we
have
them
in
six
of
the
jurisdictions,
the
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth,
seventh,
and
ninth.
all
say
that
the
mail
fraud
scheme
embraces
the
credit
card.
i
mean
the
mail
fraud
statute
embraces
the
credit
card
scheme.
the
last
case
was
--
it
just
came
down
october
17th
of
73
in
osher
in
the
second
circuit
which
went
along
with
the
majority
view.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
following
a
jury
trial,
respondent
maze
was
convicted
of
four
counts
of
using
the
mails
to
defraud
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.,
section
1341,
and
of
one
count
of
knowingly
transporting
a
stolen
automobile
in
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
the
dyer
act.
he
was
sentenced
to
concurrent
terms
of
five
years
imprisonment
on
each
count.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
conviction
for
mail
fraud,
but
affirmed
the
dyer
act
conviction,
which
is
not
here
in
issue
now.
the
united
states'
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court,
reversing
the
conviction
of
the
four
counts
of
mail
fraud.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
that’s
true.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
concurrent
sentences,
five
years
each,
one
on
the
dyer
act
and
on
the
four
counts
of
mail
fraud
and
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
the
mail
fraud
count.
the
dyer
act
conviction
was
sustained
by
judge
mccree.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
sir.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true.
benton
versus
maryland
changed
that,
so
we’re
practically
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
right,
your
honor.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
correct.
he
will
be
serving
five
years
imprisonment
no
matter
what
this
court
does,
but,
it
will
have
an
effect
on
the
law
of
the
land
as
far
as
this
particular
issue
is
concerned
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
and
also
because
we
have
--
i’m
sorry,
mr.
justice.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
that’s
certainly
true
and
it’s
important
that
this
case
be
determined
here
because
we
do
have
a
division
in
the
circuits.
although
six
of
our
circuits
agree
with
the
government’s
position
is,
one
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
that
is
opposite
and,
of
course,
the
present
one
is
before
you
today.
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
government
did
not
show
that
the
mails
were
used
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraudulent
scheme.
but
that
respondent’s
transaction
was
completed
after
he
received
the
goods
and
services
from
each
motel
and
that
the
subsequent
billing
was
merely
incidental
and
collateral
to
the
scheme
and
not
a
part
of
it.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
use
of
the
mails
that
was
charged
in
the
indictment
and
shown
by
the
evidence
practically
may
be
said
to
have
been,
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraudulent
scheme,
in
violation
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
the
government
says
yes.
the
respondent
says
no.
for
a
period
of
two
months,
ending
in
april
of
1971,
the
respondent
lived
with
one
meredith
in
louisville,
kentucky
in
meredith’s
apartment.
he
stole
from
meredith’s
apartment
a
bankamericard
belonging
to
meredith,
all
of
his
identification,
including
his
wallet,
and
he
also
took
from
him
a
1968
pontiac
tempus
automobile
and
other
personal
items.
between
april
15
and
19
of
that
same
year,
he
used
this
credit
card
to
purchase
goods
and
services
from
merchants
in
california,
louisiana,
and
florida,
all
the
time
representing
himself
as
being
meredith.
for
example,
as
charged
in
the
indictment,
on
april
17,
he
charged
over
$88
at
the
sheraton
beach
inn
in
bennington
beach,
california.
and
just
two
days
thereafter,
he
charged
over
$96
at
the
sheraton
inn
in
san
diego,
california.
the
following
week,
he
made
charges
of
over
$62
at
the
quality
motel
capri
in
new
orleans,
louisiana
and
three
days
thereafter,
at
the
holiday
inn
in
fort
lauderdale,
florida,
he
ran
up
a
bill
of
over
$54.
subsequent
to
this,
the
citizens
national
bank
of
louisville,
kentucky
which
was
the
issuer
of
the
credit
card
received
by
mail
copies
of
the
purchase
invoices
representing
these
transactions
and
requesting
reimbursement.
such
invoices,
according
to
usual
business
practice,
were
customarily
mailed
to
the
bank
and
then
mailed
monthly
to
the
card
holder
with
the
bill
for
his
total
purchases.
one
hotel
owner
testified
that
they
are
delayed
for
two
or
three
weeks
or
even
longer
before
merchants
are
advised
that
a
particular
credit
card
is
being
used
fraudulently.
when
the
respondent
left
louisville,
kentucky
in
meredith’s
pontiac,
he
drove
to
several
states.
the
first
one
is
indianapolis,
indiana,
from
there
to
st.
louis,
missouri
and
to
florida.
he
went
to
california
and
to
new
orleans
and
he
finally
ended
up
in
knoxville,
tennessee
where
the
car
developed
transmission
trouble.
at
that
time,
he
had
his
car
towed
in
by
the
amco
people
down
there,
who
took
the
car
to
their
garage
to
service
it.
and
while
he
was
there,
he
borrowed
from
the
amco
people
another
car,
a
‘64
chevrolet.
he
told
them
that
he
needed
that
car
to
go
to
a
motel
to
stay
for
the
night
and
then
he
would
return
the
next
day
to
get
his
car.
he
never
returned.
he
was
found
two
days
later
in
a
semi-conscious
condition
in
kentucky
in
a
hit-and-run
accident
and
as
a
result
of
that,
he
was
charged
with
drunken
driving
and
leaving
the
scene
of
an
accident,
but
it’s
this
amco
car
that
is
the
subject
of
the
dyer
act
conviction.
now,
in
addition
to
the
dyer
act
charge,
the
respondent
was
indicted
on
four
counts
of
mail
fraud.
the
indictment
alleged
that
he
had
devised
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
kentucky
bank,
to
defraud
meredith,
the
card
holder,
and
merchants
by
using
the
bankamericard
without
authorization
and
falsely
securing
credit
from
persons
who
had
agreements
with
bankamericard
to
furnish
goods
and
services
on
credit
to
cardholders
and,
of
course,
on
the
condition
that
payment
would
be
made
when
due.
the
indictment
alleged
that
the
use
of
the
mails
was
also
part
of
the
scheme.
we
all
realize
that
in
the
last
decade,
one
of
the
most
significant
commercial
developments
have
come
about
--
has
come
about
and
that
is
the
emergence
of
the
credit
card
as
a
substitute
for
cash.
inherent
in
the
three-part
type
of
credit
card
system,
we
submit,
is
the
use
of
the
mails.
the
use
of
the
mails
is
a
necessary
and
essential
feature
of
the
collection
in
the
billing
systems
and
in
the
processing
of
the
sales
invoices.
it
is
common
knowledge
and
i
believe
anyone
over
21,
like
respondent
who
was
31,
to
charge
to
collect
goods
with
the
credit
card
knows
that,
first,
the
card
is
a
national
card.
he
knows
too
that
the
invoices
must
be
sent
to
the
card
issuing
company
and
in
many
instances,
that’s
across
state
lines,
for
payment
and
then
to
the
owner.
in
pereira,
this
court
established
a
broad
test
for
determining
whether
a
defendant,
in
setting
in
motion
a
chain
of
events
which
results
in
the
use
of
the
mails
by
another,
has
caused
a
mailing
within
the
meaning
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
and
the
court
held
in
pereira,
“where
one
doesn’t
act
with
knowledge
that
the
use
of
the
mails
will
follow
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
or
where
such
use
can
reasonably
be
foreseen
even
though
not
actually
intended,
then
he
causes
the
mails
to
be
used.”
but
the
sixth
circuit
already
has
conceded
the
respondent
had
caused
the
mailing
of
the
purchase
receipts
to
the
louisville
bank
from
the
motel
in
the
sense
that
the
court
said
that
he
should
reasonably
have
foreseen
that
this
use
of
the
mails
would
necessarily
occur.
but
it,
nevertheless,
held
that
these
mailings
were
not
a
significant
factor
in
the
success
of
the
scheme.
we
respectfully
submit
that
these
mailings
were
an
integral
part
of
the
respondent’s
scheme
because
with
the
delay
caused
by
the
mails,
it
enabled
him
to
go
on
longer
with
the
scheme
and
enabled
him
to
avoid
detection.
at
the
core
of
any
successful
credit
card
scheme
or
any
credit
card
involving
a
single
illegal
purchase
is
the
necessary
delay
in
detecting
the
fraud.
the
respondent
should
reasonably
have
foreseen
that
the
use
of
the
mails
would
prevented
apprehension
than
being
immediate
anyway.
and
detection
effort
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
would
be
delayed.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
a
merchant
not
to
turn
in
the
invoice,
but
i
would
certainly
say
that
if
it
had
not
been
turned
in,
then
we
wouldn’t
have
a
mail
fraud
violation
because
you
have
to
have
the
use
of
the
mail.
now
whether
they
could’ve
gotten
the
invoices
over
there
by
some
other
means
is
really
not
before
us,
but
i
would
say
if
any
other
means
was
chosen,
then
there
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
but,
wouldn’t
you
agree
though
that
by
having
to
use
the
mails
to
even
notify
the
louisville
bank,
they
gave
him
another
day?
by
the
next
day,
he’d
gone
to
another
state
so
that
even
if
he
just
had
the
delay
of
one
day
caused
by
the
mail,
it
would
bring
it
still
within
the
statute.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
in
this
case,
it
would
be
the
result
of
the
mail
because
the
mail
was
used.
now,
whether
it
was
mailed
within
the
same
state
or
across
state
lines
or
--
isn’t
really
the
point
at
issue
because
even
if
it
were
mailed
within
the
same
state,
it
would
take
a
day
and
he
would
be
on
his
way
to
the
next
jurisdiction.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
we
have
many
cases,
your
honor,
concerning
what
forged
checks
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
where
forged
checks
have
been
found
to
be
--
the
mail
fraud
statute
has
been
violated
where
a
forged
check
had
been
sent
through
the
mail
and
the
mail
has
been
used,
if
they
can
show
that
by
the
use
of
the
mails
was
more
than
incidental,
but
played
an
integral
part
in
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
i
would
say
if
he
could
foresee
the
use
of
the
mail
in
this
instance,
he
has
violated
it
in
this
case
too.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
the
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
the
main
person
that
was
defrauded
was
the
issuer
of
the
card,
but
also
the
person
he
stole
the
card
from
was
defrauded
too
because
he
had
to
pay
up
to
$50
to
bankamericard
for
--
well,
he
would’ve
had
to
pay
it
if
he
had
been
notified
on
time,
i
think
in
this
case
he
was
not,
he
didn’t
have
to
pay
it.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
you
had
what?
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
you
wouldn’t
see
it
as
part
of
the
whole
scheme
to
defraud
the
charge
at
issue
or
that
he
had
to
use
meredith
too.
but,
i
think
you
are
right
that
the
crime
against
meredith
would
be
larceny
or
embezzlement,
yes.
the
decision
in
the
parr
case,
decided
by
this
court,
upon
which
the
respondent
relies,
that
decision
did
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
once
defendant
has
obtained
that
which
he
had
gotten
fraudulently
and
has
set
out
to
obtain,
once
he
has
gotten
that,
it
doesn’t
hold
that
no
subsequent
mailing
could
form
the
basis
of
a
mail
fraud
prosecution.
in
the
parr
case,
the
essence
of
the
fraud
lay
in
the
abuse
of
the
petitioner’s
position.
in
that
instance,
which
we
may
all
remember
is
the
petitioner
and
several
other
people
who
were
trustees
and
on
the
board
and
also
who
had
certain
jobs
with
this
particular
corporation
took
from
the
corporation
or
bought
on
the
corporation’s
credit
gasoline
with
its
credit
card.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
thank
you.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
develop
a
little
more,
the
theory
expressed
yesterday
afternoon
that
this
case
involves
the
substantial
use
of
the
mails
or
the
use
of
the
mails
is
as
stated
in
pereira
incident
to
an
essential
part
of
the
scheme.
it
is
significant
to
the
respondent
when
on
a
cross
country
frolic
representing
himself
as
one
meredith
to
obtain
goods
and
services,
well
knowing
that
the
issuer
of
the
card
would
not
learn
of
the
fraudulent
scheme
until
the
purchase
invoices
which
within
the
use
of
business
practices
would
be
mailed
from
the
merchant
to
the
card
issuer.
and
according
to
the
testimony,
one
hotel
owner
as
a
delay
of
two
or
three
weeks
and
often
longer
before
the
merchants
learned
that
the
particular
credit
card
is
being
used
fraudulently.
there
is
no
doubt
from
the
record
that
this
respondent
used
the
mails
in
that
fashion.
there’s
no
doubt
that
upon
receipt
of
the
invoices
through
the
mails,
discovery
of
respondent’s
fraud
would
be
uncovered.
however,
if
the
card
issuer
was
present
with
the
merchant
when
the
respondent
presented
the
credit
card,
he
would
have
been
discovered
immediately,
and
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
it’s
inherent
in
the
credit
card
system
and
without
it
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
perpetrate
this
kind
of
fraud.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
right
the
fact
that
he
selected
it
isn’t
too
important
practice
that
has
caused
his
activity
created
the
cause
of
action
which
included
the
use
of
the
mails
which
was
a
pertinent
part,
an
essential
part
in
and
of
credit
card
scheme.
and
as
you’ve
indicated
mr.
chief
justice,
the
fact
the
mails
were
used
delayed
his
detection.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
he
did
testify
your
honor
and
he
admitted
the
use
of
the
credit
card.
he
admitted
that
bankamericard
belonged
to
meredith
and
that
he
had
taken
it
but
he
said
that
he
had
permission
to
use
the
credit
card,
as
well
as
permission
to
use
the
automobile.
but
with
all
the
evidence
that
was
adduced,
the
jury
did
not
believe
him
and
found
otherwise.
in
fact,
judge
mccree
of
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
the
evidence
was
overwhelming.
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
by
the
government
was
overwhelming
to
show
that
this
was
a
fraud
and
that
he
actually
did
not
have
permission
to
use
the
credit
card.
now,
this
case
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
i
would
assume
that
they
were
paid.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
no,
i
believe
the
ultimate
loss
would
have
been
with
the
citizens
national
bank
in
louisville,
kentucky
who
issued
the
card.
the
merchants
initially
were
out
of
their
merchandise
but
the
bankamericard
has
to
reimbursed
them.
so,
the
ultimate
true
victim
would
have
been
the
card
issuer
who
does
not
get
paid
because
even
the
cardholder
is
only
obligated
up
to
$50
and
in
some
instances
it’s
not
bad
if
he
has
dutifully
notified
the
card
issuer
that
his
card
has
been
stolen.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
in
this
case,
he
didn’t
do
that.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
certainly.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
i
interpret
this
fraudulent
scheme
as
beginning
with
the
idea
of
perpetrating
a
fraudulent
scheme
and
initially,
the
innkeepers
were
defrauded.
all
the
other
things
were
steps
in
following
that
including
a
cardholder
taking
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
taking
the
cards
from
him
and
misrepresentation
in
the
first
place.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
the
cardholder
himself
was
not
actually
defrauded
but
was
all
part
of
one
fraudulent
scheme.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
certainly.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
true,
your
honor.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
he
had
defrauded
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
up
to
that
point,
that’s
right.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
without
having
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
[laughter
attempt]
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
will
agree
with
that.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
especially
as
to
the
first
count
if
he
turned
in
the
card
and
got
the
credit
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
and
there
was
no
use
of
the
mails.
it
would
have
ended
right
there.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
right.
but
that
is
not
our
case
in
that
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
i
would
be
willing
to
even
go
further
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
if
the
use
of
the
mails
were
not
involved
i
would
agree
with
that.
but
if
the
use
of
the
mails
were
involved
even
with
the
one
transaction,
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
would
be
violative
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
but
that’s
not
our
case.
our
argument
here
too
is
although
there
are
four
separate
counts,
we
consider
this
as
one
unitary
scheme
developed
from
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
five
years
each.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
hand-delivery.
i
agree
with
you.
right,
that
if
the
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
correct.
very
definitely.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
mr.
justice
powell?
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
i
would
say
that
he
could
have
brought
--
the
bank
could
have
brought
a
civil
action
against
maze,
the
respondent
here.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
right
and
i
think
that
this
is
an
analogous
situation.
i
believe
that
the
bank
could
have
brought
a
civil
action
against
the
respondent.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
in
fact,
it
may
have
been
--
it
would
have
been
a
few
left
for
them,
i’m
afraid,
because
he
--
one
reason
he
was
living
with
meredith
in
the
first
instance
was
that
he
had
no
job
and
suppose
he
was
looking
for
employment.
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is
very
definitely
the
bank
could
have
brought
a
civil
action
against
him.
this
case
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that’s
right.
in
the
1970
amendment,
the
law
states
that
credit
card,
the
misuse
or
unauthorized
use
of
credit
cards
in
excess
of
$5,000
is
punishable.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
no,
and
--
no,
it
doesn’t.
it’s
just
that
the
department
of
justice
in
many
of
these
cases
has
not
prosecuted
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
as
such
but
even
where
they
do
it
has
to
be
one
of
interstate
commerce
as
this
case.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
i
don’t
know
the
real
interpretation
of
that
but
i
would
interpret
important
as
an
ongoing
scheme
more
than
one
little
act
of
a
felon
that
might
go
and
forge
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
no,
not
at
all
and
of
course
it’s
been
well-settled
that
one
act
can
violate
two
statutes
and
these
statutes
are
not
conflicting
in
any
way.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
from
reading
the
congressional
record,
mr.
justice
white,
i
gather
that
because
as
credit
card
business
had
just
mushroomed
so
quickly
and
banks
were
sending
cards
out
all
over
the
country
even
without
people
requesting
them
and
that
there
was
beginning
to
be
such
a
problem.
the
congress
addressed
itself
to
the
problem
to
make
sure
that
anyone
who
misused
a
card
would
be
punished.
they
made
it
for
$5,000.
i
think
senator
proxmire
had
said
that
he
talked
with
the
justice
department
and
they
had
suggested
using
the
figure
$5,000
because
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
oversee
all
of
the
credit
card
cases
under
this
section.
it
doesn’t
rule
out
the
mail
fraud
section
because
you
could
be
guilty
of
the
1970
amendment
act
and
also
mail
fraud
if
it
exceeded
$5,000.
but
the
people
under
$5,000,
we
contend,
are
still
covered
by
mail
fraud
because
even
though
they
passed
this
new
law,
there’s
nothing
in
conflict.
there’s
no
talk
of
repealing
the
earlier
law
and
i
don’t’
think
we
can
repeal
the
law
by
inference
or
implication
or
what
we
think
went
on
in
the
minds
of
the
lawmakers
at
that
time.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
that’s
true
and
then
just
the
unauthorized
use
is
efficient.
so
it’s
broader
in
the
sense
although
it’s
limited
because
of
the
$5,000
figure.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
no,
i
don’t.
all
i
can
say
is
there’s
nothing
in
the
congressional
record
to
indicate
that
they
knew
that
there
are
any
cases
thought.
we’ve
had
at
least
13
cases
involving
the
mail
fraud
statute,
most
of
them
before
1970.
so
that
they
should
have
been
aware
of
it
but
there
was
no
mention
of
it
and
the
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes.
we
have
them
in
six
of
the
jurisdictions,
the
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth,
seventh,
and
ninth.
all
say
that
the
mail
fraud
scheme
embraces
the
credit
card.
i
mean
the
mail
fraud
statute
embraces
the
credit
card
scheme.
the
last
case
was
--
it
just
came
down
october
17th
of
73
in
osher
in
the
second
circuit
which
went
along
with
the
majority
view.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
