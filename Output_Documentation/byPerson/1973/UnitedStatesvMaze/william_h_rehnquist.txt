well,
it
seems
to
me,
the
real
explanation
for
delay
in
this
case
is
not
use
of
the
mails,
but
the
distance
from
the
point
of
origin
which
the
respondent
conducted
his
various
activity.
it’s
hard
for
me
to
follow
the
government’s
argument
that
implicit
in
the
use
of
the
mails
was
the
idea
of
delaying
the
discovery
because
it
seems
to
me,
once
he
was
in
fort
lauderdale
and
the
bank
was
in
louisville,
discovery
was
going
to
be
delayed
absent
of
telephone
communication
which
was
just
out
of
the
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
don’t
think
the
delay
was
caused
by
the
mails.
albeit
that
there’s
probably
a
lot
of
argument
contra
[attempt
to
laughter]
on
that
subject,
but
if
you’re
in
fort
lauderdale
and
mail
something
to
louisville
and
send
it
through
the
mail,
the
delay
in
the
people
in
louisville
finding
out
what
you’ve
sent
from
fort
lauderdale
isn’t
necessary
the
result
of
the
mail.
it’s
the
result
of
the
distance,
and
you
have
to
have
some
means
of
communication.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
have
some
coverage
under
the
truth
in
lending
section
where
you
didn’t
have
it
under
the
mail
fraud
section
too,
couldn’t
you
be
because
all
the
truth
in
lending
section
requires
is
affecting
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
a
certain
facility
that
the
federal
government
has
been
handling
something
like
that.
if
you’re
talking
about
a
motel
proprietor
fort
lauderdale,
if
you’re
talking
about
a
federal
prosecution,
the
fbi
agent
in
miami
can
go
out
and
talk
to
him.
if
you’re
talking
about
a
state
prosecution
in
kentucky,
somebody
from
the
local
county
attorney’s
office
has
got
to
fly
down
to
fort

to
him
or
else
you’ll
never
see
the
guy
before
you
put
him
to
stand?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
all
you
have
is
that
affecting
interstate
commerce
where
the
use
of
the

could
be
very
tangential
under
the
$5,000
statute

still

--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
credit
card
fraud
perpetuated
by
thomas
maze,
the
respondent
here,
was
within
the
prohibition
of
the
terms
of
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute.
in
the
early
spring
of
1971,
maze
forsook
the
jury
climate
of
the
ohio
valley
where
he
lived
and
went
on
a
trip
to
the
sun
bell,
by
presenting
a
bank
america
card
which
he
had
purloined
from
his
roommate.
maze
obtained
food
and
lodging
at
various
motels
located
in
california,
florida,
and
louisiana.
upon
his
return
to
louisville,
he
was
indicted
for
four
counts
of
violation
of
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute.
he
was
charged
with
devising
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
louisville
bank,
which
had
issued
the
bank
america
card,
his
roommate
meredith,
and
the
several
merchants
from
whom
he
had
obtained
goods
and
services.
the
only
mailings
involved
were
those
by
the
merchants
who
had
furnished
respondent
maze
with
goods
and
services.
they
later
mailed
the
sale
slips
to
the
louisville
bank
for
collection.
maze
was
found
guilty
by
a
jury
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
kentucky,
but
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
that
conviction
was
reversed.
the
critical
question
is
whether
these
mailings
by
merchants
may
be
said
to
have
been
for
the
purpose
of
executing
respondent’s
scheme?
the
mail
fraud
statute
has
had
a
long
and
illustrious
history
in
this
court
and
has
done
the
yeoman
service
in
the
prevention
of
fraud.
it
has
been
applied
by
the
court
to
corporate
looters
in
neighboring
maryland
to
conman
in
georgia
and
to
gigolos
in
the
sun
drenched
deserts
of
new
mexico.
by
giving
all
these
prior
precedents
full
value,
we
are
unable
to
take
the
additional
step
which
the
government
would
have
us
take
here.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
respondent
maze’s
scheme
had
reached
fruition
when
he
checked
out
of
the
motels
to
which
he
had
presented
the
card.
and
the
subsequent
mailings
by
the
merchants
and
motel
owners
cannot
be
said
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
executing
his
scheme.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
