chief

warren
e.

we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
maze.
mrs.
lafontant,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
there
in
the
morning,
mrs.
lafontant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
in
united
states
against
maze.
mrs.
lafontant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
other
hand,
if
hypothetically,
none
of
the
motels
or
stores
ever
sent
the
vouchers
in,
the
discovery
would
be
indefinitely
delayed
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
point
that
since
this
is
an
indispensable,
that
is
the
use
of
the
mail,
the
routine
process
of
bringing
this
to
the
notice
of
the
credit
company
is
an
indispensable,
integrated
part
of
the
whole
thing
and
it’s
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
he
didn’t
--
even
he
though
didn’t
select
the
mail
that
is
the
right
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
justify
in
this
case?
i
don’t
recall
from
the
record.
did
he
testify?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
going
back
to
the
hypothetical
--
going
back
to
the
hypothetical
i
put
to
you,
if
for
one
reason
or
another
the
tradesman
had
not
sent
the
vouchers
into
the
bank,
then
the
bank
could
never
have
been
defrauded,
could
it,
unless
they
made
personal
delivery
by
some
other
method
than
the
mail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
mail
was
an
indispensable
part
of
the
fraud
on
the
louisville
bank,
that
is
your
point,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
warner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
it
not
be
true,
mr.
warner,
that
if
you
left
this
local
prosecution,
there
would
be
prosecutions
in
four
states
or
three
states,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
were,
assuming
that
the
fact
proof
is
the
same
here,
it
would
be
potentially
one
suit
with
respect
to
each
act
of
defrauding
was
it
alleged
in
the
indictment,
am
i
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
else,
mr.
warner,
would
the
vouchers
reach
the
bank
in
louisville
in
the
normal
course
of
credit
transaction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
banks
not
use
the
mail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
challenged
to
the
government’s
position
is,
i
take
it,
that
the
per
se
rule
approach
impinges
on
the
presumptions
of
innocence
by
creating
a
presumption
of
some
kind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
if
the
courts
took
a
different
attack
and
this
is,
i
just
want
to
explore
it
with
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
familiar
with
the
rule
that
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
gives
rise
to
an
inference
which
the
jury
may,
if
it
wishes,
draw
from
the
totality
of
the
evidence
that
he
knew
it
was
stolen.
that’s
a
common
law
type
of
development
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
would
it
be
unreasonable
for
the
courts
do
you
think
instead
of
a
per
se
rule
to
develop
the
rule
that
the
possession
and
use
of
the
stolen
credit
card
creates
a
basis
for
inference
of
one
comparable
to
that
in
the
recently
stolen
property
setting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
the
possession
of
a
recently
stolen
credit
card
and
the
evidence
also
shows
the
fraudulent
use
of
it,
you’d
agree
up
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
a
common
law
type
of
rule
saying
from
at
that
point,
the
unexplained
--
the
unexplained
situation
would
give
rise
to
an
inference?
i’m
not
talking
about
a
presumption
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
inference
that
jury
might
draw
if
it
wished?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
such
a
rule
that
i
am
hypothesizing
would
not
--
would
not
get
the
government’s
home
free
by
any
means
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
it
would
mean
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
instruction
along
this
line.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
some
of
these
arguments
you’re
making
are
valid
arguments
to
be
addressed
to
congress
for
not
trying
to
give
too
much
of
a
federal
reach
for
a
court
to
consider
and
i
suppose
that’s
why
you’re
urging
among
us
that
sort
of
an
extension
approach,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
earlier,
you
knew
personally
that
if
the
mail
had
to
be
used
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
you
suggesting
then
that
some
people
might
be
held
under
the
statute
and
others
might
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
depending
on
their
sophistication
about
business
matters?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
all
of
the
points
you’re
making
in
this
direction
go
to
a
failure
proof
in
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
warner.
thank
you,
mrs.
lafontant.
mr.

to
thank
you
for
your
assistance

your

to

the
