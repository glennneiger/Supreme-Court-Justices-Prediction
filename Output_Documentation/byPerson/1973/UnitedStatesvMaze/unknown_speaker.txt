i
gather,
mrs.
lafontant,
that
this
new
70
legislation
and
the
truth
in
lending
act
--
unknown
speaker
--
that
makes
crime
of
fraudulent
use
of
credit
cards
but
that
applies
only
where
the
amount
involved
was
over
$5,000?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
noticed
in
your
footnote
at
page
37
of
your
brief,
you
suggest
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
just
as
it
has
been
following
something
like
this,
that
doesn’t
include
the
$5,000.
unknown
speaker
you
say
important
credit
frauds.
the
policy
prosecutes
under
the
mail
statute
only
important.
what’s
important?
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
i
gather
that
it’s
not
the
policy,
so
will
i
only
in
the
truth
in
lending
act
of
these
cases?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
new
act
was
prompted
at
all
by
decisions
such
as
the
one
in
here
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
were
those
cases
where
the
mail
fraud
statute
was
set
to
cover
the
transaction?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
our
cities.
