mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
court
acting
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
as
amended,
has
the
authority
to
order
arbitration
of
an
alleged
safety
dispute,
and
to
enjoin
a
work
stoppage
which
gave
rise
to
that
dispute.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
a
2:1
decision,
vacated
a
preliminary
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
district
court
acting
on
the
complaint
of
gateway
coal
company
had
issued
an
order
directing
arbitration
of
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
gateway
mine
was
rendered
unsafe
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
two
foremen
in
the
mine,
had
directed
that
the
foreman
be
suspended
pending
arbitration,
and
had
issued
an
injunction
preventing
the
gateway
employees
from
continuing
a
work
stoppage
and
furtherance
of
that
dispute.
the
sequence
of
events
leading
to
the
district
court's
order
began
on
april
15th
of
1971,
when
shortly
before
daylight,
it
was
reported
and
discovered
that
in
one
working
area
of
the
mine
there
was
a
reduction
in
airflow.
there
was
still
an
adequate
supply
of
air
substantially
above
the
federal
and
state
minimum
requirements.
no
one
had
noticed
any
difference
in
the
methane
level
in
the
mine
which
was
normally
two
tenths
of
1%.
substantially
below
the
minimum
requirements
of
federal
law
of
1%.
methane
is
detected
every
20
minutes,
there
is
a
requirement
of
federal
law
that
the
operators
check
for
methane.
no
one
had
noticed
any
diminution
or
rather,
any
increase
in
the
methane
level.
there
are
also
methane
monitors
on
the
cutting
machines
which
are
to
detect
changes
of
methane,
and
no
one
had
noticed
any
change
in
the
methane
level.
the
problem
was
traced
to
a
partial
blockage
of
an
intake
airway,
which
is
believed
to
have
occurred
at
4:30
a.m.
this
resulted
in
a
slight
short
circuiting
of
the
airflow
in
this
working
area
of
the
mine.
repairs
were
made
immediately
and
the
normal
airflow
was
restored.
the
miners
who
had
reported
to
work
on
the
first
shift
which
begins
at
8
a.m.
were
held
on
the
surface
until
the
repairs
were
completed.
they
were
told
to
standby
however,
a
number
of
them,
approximately
half
of
the
workforce
left.
the
remainder
of
the
workforce
went
in
at
about
10:30
in
the
morning.
and
the
mine
worked
without
incident
until
the
following
morning
when
the
first
shift
employees
reported
again.
at
that
time,
when
those
who
had
left
the
mine,
contrary
to
instructions,
found
out
that
they
were
not
to
receive
reporting
pay,
they
struck.
they
refuse
to
arbitrate,
they
struck.
subsequently,
the
union
requested
that
the
federal
and
safety
inspectors,
come
in
to
inspect
concerning
the
adequacy
of
the
repairs.
this
was
done
on
saturday
april
the
17th.
in
the
course
of
that
inspection,
the
inspectors
discovered
that
the
three
third
shift
foreman
had
failed
to
notice
and
detect
the
reduction
in
airflow
which
was
caused
by
the
fall
of
an
overcast,
which
is
believed
to
have
occur
at
4:30
a.m.
the
pre-shift
examination
should
have
taken
place
between
5
a.m.
and
8
a.m.
under
federal
law.
the
following
day
on
april
the
18th,
the
union
had
a
special
meeting.
and
at
that
meeting
the
union
attended
by
approximately
200
of
the
550
miners
of
the
gateway
mine,
the
men
voted
not
to
work
with
the
foreman.
by
this
time
the
company
gateway
had
suspended
two
of
the
foreman.
however
the
third
foreman
had
to
determine
not
to
suspend
pending
further
investigation,
because
he
was
the
one
that
had
reported
the
problem.
they
felt
that
he
was
in
a
different
position.
however,
the
company
reluctantly
agreed
to
the
union's
demand
that
it
suspend
all
three
foremen,
but
the
company
president
advised
the
district
president
of
the
umw
that
when
there
was
any
basis
for
him
to
put
the
three
foremen
back
to
work,
when
the
state
clarified
their
certification
status
that
he
intended
to
do
so.
at
that
time
he
believed
that
action
would
be
taken
to
determine
their
certification
status
and
under
pennsylvania
law,
a
foreman
cannot
work
without
being
certified,
and
there's
a
procedure
for
revocation
of
certification.
there
was
also
a
possibility,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
an
actuality
that
the
men
would
be
subject
to
criminal
misdemeanor
charges.
the
men
returned
to
work
on
april
the
19th
and
worked
without
incident
until
june
the
1st.
in
the
meantime,
the
criminal
misdemeanor
charge
was
filed
against
the
foreman,
and
on
april
29th
or
rather
on
may
29th
the
company
received
a
letter
from
the
department
of
environmental
resources
advising
the
company
that
it
did
not
intend
to
revoke
the
certifications
status
of
the
miners
or
rather
the
three
foremen,
and
at
the
company
was
at
liberty
to
return
the
foreman
to
work.
acting
on
this
letter,
which
as
i
indicated
went
to
the
union
with
the
copy
to
the
company.
the
company
reinstated
the
two
foreman.
one
had
retired
in
the
meantime
on
june
the
1st,
and
upon
the
act
of
the
company
in
returning
the
foreman
to
work,
the
union
struck,
took
unilateral
action
and
struck.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
about
six
weeks
later,
the
two
or
the
three
foremen
pleaded
nolo
contender,
and
they
were
fined
i
believe
$200
a
piece.
nothing
was
ever
done
with
respect
to
the
certification
status
of
the
active
foreman,
because
the
department
of
environmental
resources
decided
that
the
criminal
processes
were
inadequate
method
of
resolving
the
problem.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
the
dispute
had
its
origins
in
the
reporting
pay
issue.
the
strike
that
started
on
april
the
17th
started
before
there
was
any
or
rather
on
april
the
16th,
started
before
there
was
any
knowledge
of
any
problem
with
respect
to
foreman's
logs.
however,
after
the
strike
started
initially
over
this
reporting
pay
dispute,
it
was
converted
into
a
safety
dispute
or
an
alleged
safety
dispute
by
the
union.
our
position
is
that
the
dispute
as
to
whether
the
mine
was
rendered
unsafe
by
the
foreman,
is
clearly
one
which
is
subject
to
resolution
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
gateway
and
the
umw.
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
contains
a
very
broad
grievance
arbitration
clause.
it
would
be
difficult
to
write
a
broader
grievance
arbitration
procedure.
the
contract
states
that
the
parties
will
submit
to
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes
procedures.
all
disputes
between
them
as
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
agreement.
all
other
local
matters
and
any
local
trouble
of
any
kind
arising
at
the
mine.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
would
that
be
relevant?
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
believe
that
it
might
be
relevant,
yes
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
this
is
something
which
in
arbitrator
could,
and
i
believe
in
this
case
did
take
into
account.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
the
distinction
is
this,
under
pennsylvania
law
a
man
cannot
serve
as
a
foreman
unless
he
is
certified
by
the
state.
there
is
a
specific
period
of
experience
he
must
have
in
the
mine.
there
is
certain
training
that
he
must
have
before
he
can
achieve
certification
status.
there
is
also
a
procedure
under
pennsylvania
law
for
revocation
of
that
status,
and
if
his
license
to
practice
as
a
supervisor
in
the
mine
is
revoked,
then
it's
a
little
bit
like
a
driver's
license
he
can't
drive.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
that's
clear
in
the
record.
there
maybe
times
when
a
revocation
will
result
from
finding
of
criminal
violation,
but
this
is
by
no
means
automatic.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
completely
independent
proceedings.
the
one
is
in
the
court
and
the
other
is
an
administrative
proceeding
initially
with
the
department
of
environmental
resources.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
the
district
court
in
enjoining
the
work
stoppage,
as
i
say,
directed
arbitration
of
this
dispute,
which
was
whether
the
mine
was
rendered
unsafe
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
the
foreman
in
the
mine.
and
he
directed
that
the
foreman
be
suspended
until
the
arbitration
was
held,
and
that
if
the
arbitrator
sustained
the
company's
position
that
the
foreman
be
returned
to
work.
if
the
arbitrator
found
against
the
company,
then
they
wouldn't
be
returned
to
work,
which
i
think
was
a
very
sensible
solution
under
the
circumstances.
the
case
was
heard
by
an
arbitrator.
he
found
in
agreement
with
the
district
court
that
the
dispute
was
arbitrable.
that
was
the
first
issue
that
the
union
presented
to
him.
they
challenged
the
arbitrability,
he
found
that
it
was
arbitrable.
secondly,
he
found
that
the
decision
of
the
gateway
miners
to
refuse
to
work
with
the
foreman
was
unfounded,
and
he
also
found
that
the
mine
was
not
rendered
unsafe
by
reason
of
the
presence
a
foreman
in
the
mine.
however,
when
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
after
the
arbitrator's
decision,
the
majority
of
the
court
ruled
that
the
dispute
was
not
arbitrable.
the
conclusion
of
the
court
was
the
safety
disputes
are
sui
generis,
and
by
virtue
of
their
being
sui
generis
that
the
ordinary
presumption
of
arbitrability
of
disputes
set
forth
in
203
(d)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947,
and
as
stated
in
warrior
and
gulf
and
the
other
cases
in
the
steelworker
trilogy,
did
not
apply
to
a
dispute
regarding
safety.
the
majority
found
support
for
that
possession
it
said
in
section
502
of
the
act.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
said
that
the
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
said
that
the
arbitration
clause
did
not
expressly
provide
nor
unambiguously
provide
that
safety
disputes
were
to
be
arbitrated.
that's
the
way
the
court
handle
it
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
actually
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
because
in
footnote
1
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
well,
your
honor
most
then
if
you
said
that
then
you'd
have
a
problem
with
seniority
disputes.
here
you've
got
a
broad
overall,
all
encompassing
arbitration
clause.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes
it
was
under
footnote
1
the
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes,
well
in
the
unlikely
certainly
while
the
court
didn't
express
they
decided,
i
think
that
it
left
no
doubt,
and
in
view
of
its
holding
that
safety
disputes
are
sui
generis
by
their
nature,
it
seems
likely
to
me
in
reading
footnote
1
that
even
if
this
contract
had
specifically
provided
for
arbitration
of
safety
disputes
that
this
majority
with
judge
rosenn
dissenting,
would've
concluded
that
the
promise
to
arbitrate
safety
disputes
was
unenforceable.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
but
he
says
that
the
very
tenure
of
his
footnote
that
in
the
unlikely
event
that
a
safety
dispute
--
that
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
included
safety
disputes.
i
think
that
coupled
with
his
reasoning
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
he
did,
would
justify
an
assumption
that
even
if
this
contract
had
specifically
provided
for
arbitration
of
safety
disputes
that
the
majority
of
the
third
circuit,
that
majority
would've
ruled
that
promise
unenforceable.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
don't
think
there's
any
question.
in
effect
judge
hastie
created
what
i
would
call
a
"reverse”,
“presumption
of
none
arbitrability",
which
is
exactly
the
antithesis
of
203
(d)
and
in
301
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
section
502
the
deals
with
arbitration
of
safety
disputes.
it
just
doesn't
purport
to
deal
with
that
issue
and
consequently
there
is
nothing
in
502
which
requires
the
result
that
judge
hastie
came
to.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
sui
generis
approach
of
judge
hastie
certainly
nullifies
the
ordinary
presumption
in
favor
of
arbitrability,
and
the
intent
of
congress
that
all
disputes
of
whatever
kind
arising
out
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
should
be
resolved
by
peaceful
means
by
the
method
that
the
parties
chose.
and
in
this
case
the
parties
chose
arbitration
as
the
terminal
point
in
or
terminal
procedure
for
resolving
those
disputes.
and
i
think
that
there's
good
reason
for
that,
because
the
mind
isn't
rendered
any
more
safe
if
gateway
were
to
have
starved
these
people
into
submission.
assuming
that
there
was
a
bona
fide
safety
problem
for
the
sake
of
argument.
here
you
have
got
a
test
of
wills.
now
if
the
union
goes
out
on
strike,
maybe
it
can
force
the
company
to
change
its
position,
but
maybe
it
can't.
but
the
point
is
that
if
it
can't
that
if
the
gateway
had
starved
these
people
into
submission
that
wouldn't
have
made
the
mine
any
safer
or
any
less
safe.
it
would
not
have
changed
the
underlying
circumstances.
the
only
way
that
those
underlying
circumstances
can
be
corrected,
if
there
is
need
for
correction,
is
by
some
third
party
determination.
under
the
coal
mine
health
and
safety
act,
there's
a
provision
for
on-site
inspection
by
the
federal
mine
inspectors.
they
make
a
third
party
determination
when
they
decide
whether
there's
an
imminent
danger
which
requires
withdrawal
of
the
men
from
the
mine.
the
labor
board
under
section
502
and
ultimately
the
court
of
appeals.
it
makes
a
determination
of
the
bona
fideness
of
a
claim
of
abnormally
dangerous
conditions
when
502
is
brought
in
the
play.
so
that
there
are
many
times
when
third
parties
make
these
decisions,
and
it's
the
only
intelligent
way
to
approach
it.
self
help
is
not
the
answer.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
did
in
this
way.
first
let
me
answer
the
question
somewhat
differently.
first,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
procedure
or
the
procedures
of
the
mine
safety
program
were
ever
utilized
by
the
gateway
miners
that
the
district
court
so
held.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
secondly,
there
is
no
--
if
you
read
the
mine
safety
program,
it
does
not
permit
as
the
union
contends
that
the
miners
have
the
right
to
engage
in
a
safety
strike
anytime
that
they
believe
that
a
dangerous
condition
exists.
that
is
not
what
the
mine
safety
program
provision
says.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
did
in
this
context.
it
has
said
that
here
you're
faced
with
a
general
arbitration
clause
which
is
vague
or
general.
you
are
faced
with
a
specific
mine
safety
program,
and
consequently
the
court
interpreted
the
mine
safety
program
to
mean
that
safety
disputes
were
not
arbitrable,
but
that's
the
very
function
of
an
arbitrator,
and
not
the
court.
the
function
of
that
court
is
simply
to
determine
whether
on
its
face,
the
claim
is
subject
to
resolution
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
here
the
district
court
made
that
kind
of
analysis
ruled
at
the
dispute
of
the
foreman,
was
subject
to
resolution
on
its
face
was
subject
to
resolution
under
the
grievance
arbitration
clause.
and
the
arbitrator
ruled
that
the
dispute
was
arbitrable
too.
now,
in
effect
what
judge
hastie
did
was
to
nullify
that
arbitrator's
decision
by
interpreting
the
clause
on
the
merits
to
preclude
arbitration
of
all
safety
disputes.
i
think
that
that
was
improper.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes,
as
matter
fact
that
in
appendix
g
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
as
the
umpires
award
and
there
is
of
the
contentions
of
the
parties
with
respect
to
this
matters
are
set
forth
in
appendix
g.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
would
be
on
43
(a),
is
where
the
union's
contention
on
that
subject
is,
and
also
on
44
(a).
essentially
the
same
argument
was
made
to
the
arbitrator
as
is
made
in
this
court.
that
is
that
the
mine
safety
program
provision
operates
in
such
a
way
as
to
preclude
arbitration
of
safety
disputes.
the
arbitrator
decided
that
that
was
incorrect.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that
comes
about,
section
502
provides
that
the
quiting
of
labor
by
an
employee
or
employees
in
good
faith,
because
of
abnormal
conditions
at
the
place
of
employment
shall
not
deemed
a
strike
under
the
act.
consequently
such
a
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
it
comes
up
this
way.
the
company
discharges
employees.
they
assert
502
as
the
defense
for
their
engaging
in
a
refusal
to
work,
and
then
they
file
an
8
(a)
1,
8
(a)
3
charge,
and
it
comes
up
in
the
8
(a)
1,
8
(a)
3
context.
at
that
point
the
labor
board
must
decide
as
it
did
for
example
on
redwing
carriers
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
other
cases,
whether
the
activity
of
the
employees
was
protected
under
502.
if
so,
then
the
discharged
(inaudible)
violates
section
8
(a)
1
and/or
8
(a)
3.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
it
comes
up
the
reverse
way.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no.
and
we
would
agree
with
that.
that's
not
--
we
would
agree
with
that
and
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that
is
right.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
would
if
they
were
objective,
if
in
fact
this
were
true.
now
under
those
circumstances,
you
would
have
something
far
different
than
what
we
had
here.
and
i
think
that's
the
problem
here
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
constructed
a
subjective
test
rather
than
objective
test
in
determining
the
502,
or
in
interpreting
502.
that's
one
of
the
basic
problems
with
this
case.
they
did
not,
they
i
said
that
if
these
men
believe
that
a
safety
hazard
exists,
that
belief
is
un-reviewable
by
a
court.
and
that
is
not
what
502
says.
that
is
not
the
way
any
other
court
of
appeals
has
ever
interpreted
section
502.
that
is
not
the
way
the
labor
board
has
interpreted
502,
and
i
think
the
labor
board's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
entitled
to
considerable
deference.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
they
did
not
utilize
the
mine
safety
program
provision.
however,
we
say
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
they
did
strike
and
we
say
that
the
dispute
even
if
the
dispute
was
over
the
foreman
and
as
i
indicate
there's
at
least
a
series
of
question
as
to
whether
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
only
in
the
unsafe
area.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
all
employees
both
above
and
below
ground
and
on
all
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
absolutely
not.
they
struck
from
the
coal
tipple
to
the
preparation
plant,
both
of
which
were
above
ground.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
because
we
don't
have
to.
we
have
a
far
stronger
ground.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
well,
perhaps
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
light,
we
would
have
an
additional
basis
for
a
position.
but
the
other
basis
is
so
clear
that
we
didn't
feel
we
had
to
fall
back
on
that
position.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
if
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
take
up
several
statements
that
mr.
yablonski
made.
first,
his
reference
to
the
fact
that
mr.
kegel,
the
president
of
gateway,
testified
that
there
had
never
been
or
he
did
not
recall
any
arbitration
over
safety
with
respect
to
gateway.
that
in
itself
is
meaningless,
because
mr.
kegel
also
testified
that
he
believed
that
there
had
been
safety
disputes
arbitrated
under
this
agreement
with
other
companies,
and
in
fact
the
brief
submitted
amicus
curiae
by
the
bituminous
coal
operators
association
at
pages
15
to
16
states
that
at
least
40
cases
have
been
submitted
to
arbitration
under
the
1968
agreement
in
the
three
years
preceding
this
case.
secondly,
i
do
not
even
read
the
respondent's
brief
is
saying
that
safety
disputes
are
not
arbitrable.
what
they
say
is,
in
their
brief
that
they
have
the
choice.
that
they
have
the
right
to
either
submit
them
to
arbitration,
or
elect
to
strike.
that
is
not
what
mr.
yablonski's
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
they
made
that
claim
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
arbitrator.
he
ruled
that
other
kinds
of
safety
disputes
maybe
arbitrated
in
essence.
thier
argument,
as
mr.
yablonski
states,
is
he
says
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
mine
safety
programs
states
that
the
removal
of
the
mine
safety
committee
can
be
subject
to
arbitration
that
this
impliedly
excludes
all
other
types
of
safety
disputes.
it
doesn't
say
that
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
right.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
don't
agree
with
that.
the
mere
fact
that
the
mine
safety
program
says
that
this
type
of
dispute
maybe
submitted
to
arbitration,
doesn't
necessary
rule
out
the
fact
that
other
disputes
regarding
safety
maybe
submitted
to
arbitration.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
well,
even
this
provision
doesn't
provide
for
arbitration.
it
refers
the
parties
to
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes
procedure
for
arbitration.
in
other
words
the
mine
safety
program
provision
contains
no
provisions
specifically
dealing
with
arbitration.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
through
the
settlement
to
the
regular
grievance
arbitration
procedure.
the
same
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
it
just
says
that
kind
of
a
dispute
maybe
submitted
by
arbitration
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
but,
i
don't
think
that
that
means
necessarily.
there
are
others
which
are
not
subject
to
arbitration.
in
any
event
that's
a
question
concerning
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement
that
the
arbitrator
is
in
a
position
to
determine.
he
determined
that
against
the
union.
now,
finally
i
would
like
to
mention
the
fact
that
mr.
yablonski
says
that
judge
mccune
ruled
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
it,
because
the
arbitrators
already
decided
it.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that
is
exactly
right
that
is
my
position.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
before
that,
before
you
ever
get
to
that
point
the
union
has
to
invoke
the
mine
safety
procedures,
which
it
never
invoked.
they
never
made
the
request
to
management
for
withdrawal
of
the
manner,
or
any
of
those
things
that
are
provided.
the
only
way
you
get
to
the
terminal
point
of
the
mine
safety
program
is
if
they
invoke
the
procedure.
they're
in
the
position
of
relying
upon
a
procedure
that
they
never
invoked.
now,
one
other
thing
that
i'd
like
to
mention,
is
the
fact
there
was
no
ruling
by
judge
mccune
that
counsel
could
not
be
present
in
this
arbitration.
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
settlement
of
local
district
disputes
or
procedure
that
specifies
that.
that's
right
in
the
grievance
arbitration
clause.
i
don't
know
how
it
got
there,
but
it
is
there.
finally,
the
reason
that
the
award
was
--
the
arbitration
award
was
stricken,
because
in
point
of
time,
it
happened
to
come
down
after
the
record
had
been
transmitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
we
stated
in
footnote
12
to
our
reply
brief.
in
a
companion
or
related
case,
unites
states
steel
corporation
versus
umw
in
point
of
time
the
arbitration
the
word
came
down
before
the
record
was
transmitted
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it's
part
of
the
record
in
that
case.
and
finally,
obviously
that
court
must
still
consider
the
arbitration
award
material
to
this
proceeding,
because
it
plays
great
emphasis
on
it
and
its
decision,
and
it
is.
it
is
a
part
of
this
case.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
court
acting
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
as
amended,
has
the
authority
to
order
arbitration
of
an
alleged
safety
dispute,
and
to
enjoin
a
work
stoppage
which
gave
rise
to
that
dispute.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
a
2:1
decision,
vacated
a
preliminary
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
district
court
acting
on
the
complaint
of
gateway
coal
company
had
issued
an
order
directing
arbitration
of
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
gateway
mine
was
rendered
unsafe
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
two
foremen
in
the
mine,
had
directed
that
the
foreman
be
suspended
pending
arbitration,
and
had
issued
an
injunction
preventing
the
gateway
employees
from
continuing
a
work
stoppage
and
furtherance
of
that
dispute.
the
sequence
of
events
leading
to
the
district
court's
order
began
on
april
15th
of
1971,
when
shortly
before
daylight,
it
was
reported
and
discovered
that
in
one
working
area
of
the
mine
there
was
a
reduction
in
airflow.
there
was
still
an
adequate
supply
of
air
substantially
above
the
federal
and
state
minimum
requirements.
no
one
had
noticed
any
difference
in
the
methane
level
in
the
mine
which
was
normally
two
tenths
of
1%.
substantially
below
the
minimum
requirements
of
federal
law
of
1%.
methane
is
detected
every
20
minutes,
there
is
a
requirement
of
federal
law
that
the
operators
check
for
methane.
no
one
had
noticed
any
diminution
or
rather,
any
increase
in
the
methane
level.
there
are
also
methane
monitors
on
the
cutting
machines
which
are
to
detect
changes
of
methane,
and
no
one
had
noticed
any
change
in
the
methane
level.
the
problem
was
traced
to
a
partial
blockage
of
an
intake
airway,
which
is
believed
to
have
occurred
at
4:30
a.m.
this
resulted
in
a
slight
short
circuiting
of
the
airflow
in
this
working
area
of
the
mine.
repairs
were
made
immediately
and
the
normal
airflow
was
restored.
the
miners
who
had
reported
to
work
on
the
first
shift
which
begins
at
8
a.m.
were
held
on
the
surface
until
the
repairs
were
completed.
they
were
told
to
standby
however,
a
number
of
them,
approximately
half
of
the
workforce
left.
the
remainder
of
the
workforce
went
in
at
about
10:30
in
the
morning.
and
the
mine
worked
without
incident
until
the
following
morning
when
the
first
shift
employees
reported
again.
at
that
time,
when
those
who
had
left
the
mine,
contrary
to
instructions,
found
out
that
they
were
not
to
receive
reporting
pay,
they
struck.
they
refuse
to
arbitrate,
they
struck.
subsequently,
the
union
requested
that
the
federal
and
safety
inspectors,
come
in
to
inspect
concerning
the
adequacy
of
the
repairs.
this
was
done
on
saturday
april
the
17th.
in
the
course
of
that
inspection,
the
inspectors
discovered
that
the
three
third
shift
foreman
had
failed
to
notice
and
detect
the
reduction
in
airflow
which
was
caused
by
the
fall
of
an
overcast,
which
is
believed
to
have
occur
at
4:30
a.m.
the
pre-shift
examination
should
have
taken
place
between
5
a.m.
and
8
a.m.
under
federal
law.
the
following
day
on
april
the
18th,
the
union
had
a
special
meeting.
and
at
that
meeting
the
union
attended
by
approximately
200
of
the
550
miners
of
the
gateway
mine,
the
men
voted
not
to
work
with
the
foreman.
by
this
time
the
company
gateway
had
suspended
two
of
the
foreman.
however
the
third
foreman
had
to
determine
not
to
suspend
pending
further
investigation,
because
he
was
the
one
that
had
reported
the
problem.
they
felt
that
he
was
in
a
different
position.
however,
the
company
reluctantly
agreed
to
the
union's
demand
that
it
suspend
all
three
foremen,
but
the
company
president
advised
the
district
president
of
the
umw
that
when
there
was
any
basis
for
him
to
put
the
three
foremen
back
to
work,
when
the
state
clarified
their
certification
status
that
he
intended
to
do
so.
at
that
time
he
believed
that
action
would
be
taken
to
determine
their
certification
status
and
under
pennsylvania
law,
a
foreman
cannot
work
without
being
certified,
and
there's
a
procedure
for
revocation
of
certification.
there
was
also
a
possibility,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
an
actuality
that
the
men
would
be
subject
to
criminal
misdemeanor
charges.
the
men
returned
to
work
on
april
the
19th
and
worked
without
incident
until
june
the
1st.
in
the
meantime,
the
criminal
misdemeanor
charge
was
filed
against
the
foreman,
and
on
april
29th
or
rather
on
may
29th
the
company
received
a
letter
from
the
department
of
environmental
resources
advising
the
company
that
it
did
not
intend
to
revoke
the
certifications
status
of
the
miners
or
rather
the
three
foremen,
and
at
the
company
was
at
liberty
to
return
the
foreman
to
work.
acting
on
this
letter,
which
as
i
indicated
went
to
the
union
with
the
copy
to
the
company.
the
company
reinstated
the
two
foreman.
one
had
retired
in
the
meantime
on
june
the
1st,
and
upon
the
act
of
the
company
in
returning
the
foreman
to
work,
the
union
struck,
took
unilateral
action
and
struck.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
about
six
weeks
later,
the
two
or
the
three
foremen
pleaded
nolo
contender,
and
they
were
fined
i
believe
$200
a
piece.
nothing
was
ever
done
with
respect
to
the
certification
status
of
the
active
foreman,
because
the
department
of
environmental
resources
decided
that
the
criminal
processes
were
inadequate
method
of
resolving
the
problem.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
the
dispute
had
its
origins
in
the
reporting
pay
issue.
the
strike
that
started
on
april
the
17th
started
before
there
was
any
or
rather
on
april
the
16th,
started
before
there
was
any
knowledge
of
any
problem
with
respect
to
foreman's
logs.
however,
after
the
strike
started
initially
over
this
reporting
pay
dispute,
it
was
converted
into
a
safety
dispute
or
an
alleged
safety
dispute
by
the
union.
our
position
is
that
the
dispute
as
to
whether
the
mine
was
rendered
unsafe
by
the
foreman,
is
clearly
one
which
is
subject
to
resolution
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
gateway
and
the
umw.
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
contains
a
very
broad
grievance
arbitration
clause.
it
would
be
difficult
to
write
a
broader
grievance
arbitration
procedure.
the
contract
states
that
the
parties
will
submit
to
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes
procedures.
all
disputes
between
them
as
to
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
agreement.
all
other
local
matters
and
any
local
trouble
of
any
kind
arising
at
the
mine.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
would
that
be
relevant?
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
believe
that
it
might
be
relevant,
yes
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
this
is
something
which
in
arbitrator
could,
and
i
believe
in
this
case
did
take
into
account.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
the
distinction
is
this,
under
pennsylvania
law
a
man
cannot
serve
as
a
foreman
unless
he
is
certified
by
the
state.
there
is
a
specific
period
of
experience
he
must
have
in
the
mine.
there
is
certain
training
that
he
must
have
before
he
can
achieve
certification
status.
there
is
also
a
procedure
under
pennsylvania
law
for
revocation
of
that
status,
and
if
his
license
to
practice
as
a
supervisor
in
the
mine
is
revoked,
then
it's
a
little
bit
like
a
driver's
license
he
can't
drive.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
that's
clear
in
the
record.
there
maybe
times
when
a
revocation
will
result
from
finding
of
criminal
violation,
but
this
is
by
no
means
automatic.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
completely
independent
proceedings.
the
one
is
in
the
court
and
the
other
is
an
administrative
proceeding
initially
with
the
department
of
environmental
resources.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
the
district
court
in
enjoining
the
work
stoppage,
as
i
say,
directed
arbitration
of
this
dispute,
which
was
whether
the
mine
was
rendered
unsafe
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
the
foreman
in
the
mine.
and
he
directed
that
the
foreman
be
suspended
until
the
arbitration
was
held,
and
that
if
the
arbitrator
sustained
the
company's
position
that
the
foreman
be
returned
to
work.
if
the
arbitrator
found
against
the
company,
then
they
wouldn't
be
returned
to
work,
which
i
think
was
a
very
sensible
solution
under
the
circumstances.
the
case
was
heard
by
an
arbitrator.
he
found
in
agreement
with
the
district
court
that
the
dispute
was
arbitrable.
that
was
the
first
issue
that
the
union
presented
to
him.
they
challenged
the
arbitrability,
he
found
that
it
was
arbitrable.
secondly,
he
found
that
the
decision
of
the
gateway
miners
to
refuse
to
work
with
the
foreman
was
unfounded,
and
he
also
found
that
the
mine
was
not
rendered
unsafe
by
reason
of
the
presence
a
foreman
in
the
mine.
however,
when
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
after
the
arbitrator's
decision,
the
majority
of
the
court
ruled
that
the
dispute
was
not
arbitrable.
the
conclusion
of
the
court
was
the
safety
disputes
are
sui
generis,
and
by
virtue
of
their
being
sui
generis
that
the
ordinary
presumption
of
arbitrability
of
disputes
set
forth
in
203
(d)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947,
and
as
stated
in
warrior
and
gulf
and
the
other
cases
in
the
steelworker
trilogy,
did
not
apply
to
a
dispute
regarding
safety.
the
majority
found
support
for
that
possession
it
said
in
section
502
of
the
act.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
said
that
the
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
said
that
the
arbitration
clause
did
not
expressly
provide
nor
unambiguously
provide
that
safety
disputes
were
to
be
arbitrated.
that's
the
way
the
court
handle
it
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
actually
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
because
in
footnote
1
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
well,
your
honor
most
then
if
you
said
that
then
you'd
have
a
problem
with
seniority
disputes.
here
you've
got
a
broad
overall,
all
encompassing
arbitration
clause.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes
it
was
under
footnote
1
the
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes,
well
in
the
unlikely
certainly
while
the
court
didn't
express
they
decided,
i
think
that
it
left
no
doubt,
and
in
view
of
its
holding
that
safety
disputes
are
sui
generis
by
their
nature,
it
seems
likely
to
me
in
reading
footnote
1
that
even
if
this
contract
had
specifically
provided
for
arbitration
of
safety
disputes
that
this
majority
with
judge
rosenn
dissenting,
would've
concluded
that
the
promise
to
arbitrate
safety
disputes
was
unenforceable.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
but
he
says
that
the
very
tenure
of
his
footnote
that
in
the
unlikely
event
that
a
safety
dispute
--
that
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
included
safety
disputes.
i
think
that
coupled
with
his
reasoning
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
he
did,
would
justify
an
assumption
that
even
if
this
contract
had
specifically
provided
for
arbitration
of
safety
disputes
that
the
majority
of
the
third
circuit,
that
majority
would've
ruled
that
promise
unenforceable.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
don't
think
there's
any
question.
in
effect
judge
hastie
created
what
i
would
call
a
"reverse”,
“presumption
of
none
arbitrability",
which
is
exactly
the
antithesis
of
203
(d)
and
in
301
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
section
502
the
deals
with
arbitration
of
safety
disputes.
it
just
doesn't
purport
to
deal
with
that
issue
and
consequently
there
is
nothing
in
502
which
requires
the
result
that
judge
hastie
came
to.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
sui
generis
approach
of
judge
hastie
certainly
nullifies
the
ordinary
presumption
in
favor
of
arbitrability,
and
the
intent
of
congress
that
all
disputes
of
whatever
kind
arising
out
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
should
be
resolved
by
peaceful
means
by
the
method
that
the
parties
chose.
and
in
this
case
the
parties
chose
arbitration
as
the
terminal
point
in
or
terminal
procedure
for
resolving
those
disputes.
and
i
think
that
there's
good
reason
for
that,
because
the
mind
isn't
rendered
any
more
safe
if
gateway
were
to
have
starved
these
people
into
submission.
assuming
that
there
was
a
bona
fide
safety
problem
for
the
sake
of
argument.
here
you
have
got
a
test
of
wills.
now
if
the
union
goes
out
on
strike,
maybe
it
can
force
the
company
to
change
its
position,
but
maybe
it
can't.
but
the
point
is
that
if
it
can't
that
if
the
gateway
had
starved
these
people
into
submission
that
wouldn't
have
made
the
mine
any
safer
or
any
less
safe.
it
would
not
have
changed
the
underlying
circumstances.
the
only
way
that
those
underlying
circumstances
can
be
corrected,
if
there
is
need
for
correction,
is
by
some
third
party
determination.
under
the
coal
mine
health
and
safety
act,
there's
a
provision
for
on-site
inspection
by
the
federal
mine
inspectors.
they
make
a
third
party
determination
when
they
decide
whether
there's
an
imminent
danger
which
requires
withdrawal
of
the
men
from
the
mine.
the
labor
board
under
section
502
and
ultimately
the
court
of
appeals.
it
makes
a
determination
of
the
bona
fideness
of
a
claim
of
abnormally
dangerous
conditions
when
502
is
brought
in
the
play.
so
that
there
are
many
times
when
third
parties
make
these
decisions,
and
it's
the
only
intelligent
way
to
approach
it.
self
help
is
not
the
answer.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
did
in
this
way.
first
let
me
answer
the
question
somewhat
differently.
first,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
procedure
or
the
procedures
of
the
mine
safety
program
were
ever
utilized
by
the
gateway
miners
that
the
district
court
so
held.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
secondly,
there
is
no
--
if
you
read
the
mine
safety
program,
it
does
not
permit
as
the
union
contends
that
the
miners
have
the
right
to
engage
in
a
safety
strike
anytime
that
they
believe
that
a
dangerous
condition
exists.
that
is
not
what
the
mine
safety
program
provision
says.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
did
in
this
context.
it
has
said
that
here
you're
faced
with
a
general
arbitration
clause
which
is
vague
or
general.
you
are
faced
with
a
specific
mine
safety
program,
and
consequently
the
court
interpreted
the
mine
safety
program
to
mean
that
safety
disputes
were
not
arbitrable,
but
that's
the
very
function
of
an
arbitrator,
and
not
the
court.
the
function
of
that
court
is
simply
to
determine
whether
on
its
face,
the
claim
is
subject
to
resolution
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
here
the
district
court
made
that
kind
of
analysis
ruled
at
the
dispute
of
the
foreman,
was
subject
to
resolution
on
its
face
was
subject
to
resolution
under
the
grievance
arbitration
clause.
and
the
arbitrator
ruled
that
the
dispute
was
arbitrable
too.
now,
in
effect
what
judge
hastie
did
was
to
nullify
that
arbitrator's
decision
by
interpreting
the
clause
on
the
merits
to
preclude
arbitration
of
all
safety
disputes.
i
think
that
that
was
improper.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes,
as
matter
fact
that
in
appendix
g
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
as
the
umpires
award
and
there
is
of
the
contentions
of
the
parties
with
respect
to
this
matters
are
set
forth
in
appendix
g.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
would
be
on
43
(a),
is
where
the
union's
contention
on
that
subject
is,
and
also
on
44
(a).
essentially
the
same
argument
was
made
to
the
arbitrator
as
is
made
in
this
court.
that
is
that
the
mine
safety
program
provision
operates
in
such
a
way
as
to
preclude
arbitration
of
safety
disputes.
the
arbitrator
decided
that
that
was
incorrect.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
yes.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that
comes
about,
section
502
provides
that
the
quiting
of
labor
by
an
employee
or
employees
in
good
faith,
because
of
abnormal
conditions
at
the
place
of
employment
shall
not
deemed
a
strike
under
the
act.
consequently
such
a
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
it
comes
up
this
way.
the
company
discharges
employees.
they
assert
502
as
the
defense
for
their
engaging
in
a
refusal
to
work,
and
then
they
file
an
8
(a)
1,
8
(a)
3
charge,
and
it
comes
up
in
the
8
(a)
1,
8
(a)
3
context.
at
that
point
the
labor
board
must
decide
as
it
did
for
example
on
redwing
carriers
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
other
cases,
whether
the
activity
of
the
employees
was
protected
under
502.
if
so,
then
the
discharged
(inaudible)
violates
section
8
(a)
1
and/or
8
(a)
3.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
it
comes
up
the
reverse
way.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no.
and
we
would
agree
with
that.
that's
not
--
we
would
agree
with
that
and
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that
is
right.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
it
would
if
they
were
objective,
if
in
fact
this
were
true.
now
under
those
circumstances,
you
would
have
something
far
different
than
what
we
had
here.
and
i
think
that's
the
problem
here
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
constructed
a
subjective
test
rather
than
objective
test
in
determining
the
502,
or
in
interpreting
502.
that's
one
of
the
basic
problems
with
this
case.
they
did
not,
they
i
said
that
if
these
men
believe
that
a
safety
hazard
exists,
that
belief
is
un-reviewable
by
a
court.
and
that
is
not
what
502
says.
that
is
not
the
way
any
other
court
of
appeals
has
ever
interpreted
section
502.
that
is
not
the
way
the
labor
board
has
interpreted
502,
and
i
think
the
labor
board's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
entitled
to
considerable
deference.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
they
did
not
utilize
the
mine
safety
program
provision.
however,
we
say
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
they
did
strike
and
we
say
that
the
dispute
even
if
the
dispute
was
over
the
foreman
and
as
i
indicate
there's
at
least
a
series
of
question
as
to
whether
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
only
in
the
unsafe
area.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
all
employees
both
above
and
below
ground
and
on
all
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
absolutely
not.
they
struck
from
the
coal
tipple
to
the
preparation
plant,
both
of
which
were
above
ground.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
because
we
don't
have
to.
we
have
a
far
stronger
ground.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
well,
perhaps
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
light,
we
would
have
an
additional
basis
for
a
position.
but
the
other
basis
is
so
clear
that
we
didn't
feel
we
had
to
fall
back
on
that
position.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
if
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
take
up
several
statements
that
mr.
yablonski
made.
first,
his
reference
to
the
fact
that
mr.
kegel,
the
president
of
gateway,
testified
that
there
had
never
been
or
he
did
not
recall
any
arbitration
over
safety
with
respect
to
gateway.
that
in
itself
is
meaningless,
because
mr.
kegel
also
testified
that
he
believed
that
there
had
been
safety
disputes
arbitrated
under
this
agreement
with
other
companies,
and
in
fact
the
brief
submitted
amicus
curiae
by
the
bituminous
coal
operators
association
at
pages
15
to
16
states
that
at
least
40
cases
have
been
submitted
to
arbitration
under
the
1968
agreement
in
the
three
years
preceding
this
case.
secondly,
i
do
not
even
read
the
respondent's
brief
is
saying
that
safety
disputes
are
not
arbitrable.
what
they
say
is,
in
their
brief
that
they
have
the
choice.
that
they
have
the
right
to
either
submit
them
to
arbitration,
or
elect
to
strike.
that
is
not
what
mr.
yablonski's
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
they
made
that
claim
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
arbitrator.
he
ruled
that
other
kinds
of
safety
disputes
maybe
arbitrated
in
essence.
thier
argument,
as
mr.
yablonski
states,
is
he
says
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
mine
safety
programs
states
that
the
removal
of
the
mine
safety
committee
can
be
subject
to
arbitration
that
this
impliedly
excludes
all
other
types
of
safety
disputes.
it
doesn't
say
that
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
right.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
don't
agree
with
that.
the
mere
fact
that
the
mine
safety
program
says
that
this
type
of
dispute
maybe
submitted
to
arbitration,
doesn't
necessary
rule
out
the
fact
that
other
disputes
regarding
safety
maybe
submitted
to
arbitration.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
well,
even
this
provision
doesn't
provide
for
arbitration.
it
refers
the
parties
to
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes
procedure
for
arbitration.
in
other
words
the
mine
safety
program
provision
contains
no
provisions
specifically
dealing
with
arbitration.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
through
the
settlement
to
the
regular
grievance
arbitration
procedure.
the
same
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
it
just
says
that
kind
of
a
dispute
maybe
submitted
by
arbitration
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
but,
i
don't
think
that
that
means
necessarily.
there
are
others
which
are
not
subject
to
arbitration.
in
any
event
that's
a
question
concerning
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement
that
the
arbitrator
is
in
a
position
to
determine.
he
determined
that
against
the
union.
now,
finally
i
would
like
to
mention
the
fact
that
mr.
yablonski
says
that
judge
mccune
ruled
--
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
i
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
it,
because
the
arbitrators
already
decided
it.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
that
is
exactly
right
that
is
my
position.
mr.
leonard
l.
scheinholtz
no,
before
that,
before
you
ever
get
to
that
point
the
union
has
to
invoke
the
mine
safety
procedures,
which
it
never
invoked.
they
never
made
the
request
to
management
for
withdrawal
of
the
manner,
or
any
of
those
things
that
are
provided.
the
only
way
you
get
to
the
terminal
point
of
the
mine
safety
program
is
if
they
invoke
the
procedure.
they're
in
the
position
of
relying
upon
a
procedure
that
they
never
invoked.
now,
one
other
thing
that
i'd
like
to
mention,
is
the
fact
there
was
no
ruling
by
judge
mccune
that
counsel
could
not
be
present
in
this
arbitration.
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
settlement
of
local
district
disputes
or
procedure
that
specifies
that.
that's
right
in
the
grievance
arbitration
clause.
i
don't
know
how
it
got
there,
but
it
is
there.
finally,
the
reason
that
the
