number
72-782,
gateway
coal
against
united
mine
workers,
involves
a
dispute
between
gateway
coal
operating
a
mine
in
pennsylvania
and
the
umw.
certain
foremen
were
suspended
for
falsifying
records
as
to
airflow
conditions
in
the
mine.
when
the
company
reinstated
the
foremen
pursuant
to
authorization
from
state
authorities,
the
union
employees
walked
out
to
protest
the
alleged
safety
hazard
created
by
the
return
of
the
discharged
foremen.
the
union
refused
to
arbitrate
the
dispute,
contending
that
an
issue
of
mine
safety
was
not
subject
to
arbitration.
the
company
brought
suit
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
it
contended
that
the
broad
arbitration
clause
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
governed
the
dispute.
the
district
court
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
against
continuation
of
the
strike
and
ordered
arbitration.
in
addition,
the
court
suspended
the
foremen
pending
the
decision
in
arbitration.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari.
the
arbitration
clause
expressly
covers
any
local
trouble
of
any
kind
arising
at
the
mine.
the
clause
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
dispute,
although
that
was
no
express
agreement
not
the
strike.
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
that
a
contractual
duty
to
arbitrate,
gives
rise
to
an
implied
no
strike
obligation.
the
union
relied
on
section
502
of
the
act
which
provides
that
the
quiting
of
the
employees
in
good
faith
because
of
abnormal
and
dangerous
conditions
shall
not
be
deemed
a
strike.
we
conclude,
however,
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
502
is
not
applicable.
we
conclude
further
that
the
district
court
had
authority
to
enforce
the
no
strike
obligation.
we
noted
that
suspension
by
the
district
court
of
the
foremen
in
question,
pending
filed
arbitration
had
eliminated
any
threat
of
safety.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
