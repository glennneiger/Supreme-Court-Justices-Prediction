justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
he
had
any
rate
apply
a
much
stricter
standard
in
determining
whether
a
general
arbitration
clause
embraced
a
safety
matter,
than
has
been
customarily
applied
by
courts
in
determining
whether
a
general
clause
embraced
particular
matter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
yablonski,
before
you
get
into
that,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
about
the
stay
and
district
court
order
of
business.
did
the
district
court's
injunction
order
you
to
do
anything
more
than
to
arbitrate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
do
you
wait
to
seek
a
stay
in
the
court
of
appeals
until
you've
actually
gone
to
arbitration?
i
mean,
isn't
that
aspect
i
think
pretty
well
moot
by
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
petitioner
make
the
argument
that
even
if
it
wasn't
in
the
record
there,
it
was
in
the
public
record?
