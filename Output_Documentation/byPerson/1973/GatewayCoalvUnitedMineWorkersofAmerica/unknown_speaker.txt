unknown
speaker
whatever
happened
to
those
criminal
charges,
mr.
scheinholtz?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
what
is
the
company's
position
with
respect
to
the
strike?
that
is
the
reason
for
it,
was
it
the
reinstatement
of
the
foreman,
or
was
it
the
earlier
company
position
not
to
allow
pay?
unknown
speaker
but
the
majority
didn't
say
that
the
arbitration
clause
didn't
cover
this
to
dispute.
unknown
speaker
instead,
it
was
unenforceable.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
much
of
a
case
if
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
include
it
in
the
arbitration
provision
including
safety
disputes.
unknown
speaker
but
i
sort
of
had
the
impression
justice
brennan
indicated
the
third
circuit
would've
come
out
the
same
way.
unknown
speaker
purportedly
the
question
entirely
open
in
the
footnote
in
the
second
paragraph
on
footnote
1
on
page
18
(a)
of
the
petition
for
writ
certiorari,
said
it's
also
unnecessary
to
decide
whether
in
the
unlikely
cause
of
a
contract.
well
you
know
what
it
says?
unknown
speaker
now,
how
can
you
say
that
when
the
opinion
of
judge
hastie
explicitly
and
expressly
says
that
it's
unnecessary
to
decide
that
question?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sceinholtz,
may
i
ask
you,
you
suggested
on
(inaudible)
or
something
under
502
might
have
been
cognizable
by
the
national
labor
relations
board?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
come
about.
could
you
have
brought
an
unfound
--
unknown
speaker
could
the
company
have
initiated
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
but
the
company
could
not
--
unknown
speaker
it's
self
initiated.
unknown
speaker
would
you
argue
that
only
aside
from
the
arbitration
provision
this
strike
was
enjoinable
by
reason
of
the
union's
failure
to
follow
the
safety
provisions
of
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
and
they
did
strike.
unknown
speaker
safety
provision
would
say
"you
may
be
ordered
off
the
job
in
the
area
where
the
dangerous
safety
condition
exist?
unknown
speaker
and
then
all
employees
walked
off.
unknown
speaker
where
these
two
foreman
had
no
authority
whatsoever?
unknown
speaker
so
tell
me
why
you
wouldn't
make
that
argument
about
the
enjoinability
of
the
strike?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
part
of
the
case
against
you
is
that
the
provision
against
the
arbitration
shouldn't
apply
because
there's
another
provision
in
the
contract
governing
the
situation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
yablonski,--
equipment
or
is
that
--
unknown
speaker
in
what
status
did
this
case
come
here,
has
there
been
final
decision
on
the
case?
unknown
speaker
an
affirmance
-?
unknown
speaker
a
reversal,
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
you
were
defending
the
preliminary
injunction?
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
preliminary
injunction
involve
--
the
forbid
these
foreman
to
go
back
to
work?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
in
fact
arbitrated.
unknown
speaker
in
the
meantime.
unknown
speaker
but
without
the
foreman
being
at
work.
unknown
speaker
after
reversing
-?
unknown
speaker
because
that's
what
the
injunction
--
unknown
speaker
well,
you
were
ordered
to
go
to
arbitration
by
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
you
went
to
arbitration
without,
at
that
point
challenging
the
validity
of
the
order
upon
you
to
go
to
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
get
a
stay?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
problem.
did
you
ask
for
it?
unknown
speaker
what
way?
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
tell
me
why,
i
gather
that
your
basic
argument
is
that
this
was
not
an
arbitrable
dispute
because
the
contract
itself
did
not
make
it
arbitrable.
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
you
did
go
to
arbitration,
now
why?
unknown
speaker
but
why
didn't
you
take
his
order
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
get
a
stay.
unknown
speaker
yet,
nevertheless
appealing
the
basic
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
now
he
says
safety
disputes
were
not
arbitrable.
you
don't
mean
(inaudible)
you
mean
under
this
agreement,
they
were
--
unknown
speaker
now
you
to
take
into
position
this
is
a
contract
case?
unknown
speaker
provision
to
502
case
in
anyway.
unknown
speaker
the
original
general
agreement
with
the
industry,
did
you
get
back
under
the
history
of
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
mean
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
and
you
were
refused?
unknown
speaker
by
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
you
don't
know
whether
you
asked
them
before
that
first?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
the
complete
record
is
here
mr.
yablonski,
even
not
printed.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
crossfire
maybe
a
counsel
i
guess?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
i
gather
--
unknown
speaker
what
we
have
here
in
appendix
g,
i
gather
is
the
arbitrators
at
least
beginning
at
page
40
is
that
the
arbitrator's
opinion?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
notice
at
page
44
(a)
under
the
subhead
safety
starts
out
"the
union's
position
in
this
hearing
and
also
on
federal
court
is
that
safety
is
not
arbitrable
issue."
is
that
what
--
unknown
speaker
whatever,
this
indicates
that
the
union
did
--
unknown
speaker
--
protest
that
it
was
not
an
arbitrable
--
unknown
speaker
now,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
yablonski?
that's
what
carves
it
out
safety
matters,
are
they
the
provisions
at
pages
12
(a)
and
13
(a)?
unknown
speaker
and
that
all
precedes
the
provision
on
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes
in
the
text
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
because
as
you
said
that's
awfully
boarder
than
the
language,
isn't
it
at
13
(a),
or
should
any
local
trouble
of
any
kind
arise
at
the
mine.
unknown
speaker
who
is
it
that
removes
members
of
the
committee
who
act
arbitrarily
and
capriciously?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
the
union
refuses
then
it
goes
to
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
and
the
issue
at
stake
then
is
whether
the
committee
acted
to
arbitrarily
or
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
but
does
these
provisions
contemplate
that
in
addition
to
caring
out
the
procedures
of
the
mine
safety
provisions
here
run
through
these
that
the
union
--
unknown
speaker
well,
wait
a
minute,
should
the
union
also
strike
while
these
provisions
are
going
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
these
provisions
themselves
say
only
if
the
mine
committee
determines
that
a
section
of
mine
is
unsafe
while
employees
be
removed
from
that
section.
unknown
speaker
or
the
union
before
that
determination
is
made
walk
out?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
how
about,
did
the
mine
safety
committee
act?
unknown
speaker
what
did
it
say?
unknown
speaker
and
did
it
do
this,
mr.
yablonski?
in
those
special
instances
where
the
committee
believes
an
immediate
danger
exists,
and
the
committee
recommends
that
the
management
remove
all
mine
workers
from
the
unsafe
area.
the
operators
required
to
follow
the
recommendation
of
the
committee?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
this
is
the
basic
language
upon
which
you
rely.
unknown
speaker
that
sentence
there
was
read
by
my
brother
brennan?
unknown
speaker
and
you,
i
take
it
before
the
arbitrator,
you
said
that
whether
or
not
the
committee
acted
arbitrarily
or
not
was
an
issue
open
to
arbitration?
i
take
it
that's
what
the
arbitrator
said.
the
union
states
that
it
feels
the
only
issue
which
can
be
arbitrated
in
this
hearing
is
whether
or
not
the
safety
committee
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
alright,
now
your
position
nevertheless
is
that
even
though
the
management
challenges
the
action
of
the
committee,
and
it
claims
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
therefore
the
issue
becomes
arbitrable.
you
claim
that
the
union
may
strike
pending
that
determination
of
whether
the
safety
committee
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
boys
market?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
issue
of
arbitrariness
or
capriciousness
of
the
committee
is
arbitrable.
unknown
speaker
and
pending
that
arbitration,
you
claim
that
boys
market
does
not
preventive
strike?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
really
relying
on
that?
well,
as
i
remember
some
years
now
mr.
yablonski,
i
wrote
benedict
coal.
and
i
think
as
i
recall
it,
and
the
national
agreement
had
no
strike
provision
at
all,
did
it?
and
we
divided
equally
as
i
remember,
i
think
justice
stewart
then
is
judge
stewart
as
i
recall
it
on
the
sixth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
when
there's
a
promise
to
arbitrate,
does
it
make
any
different
whether
the
contract
has
a
no
strike
clause
in
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
boys
market
sort
of
settled
in?
unknown
speaker
but
then
we
rather
--
i
don't
know
some
--
but
we've
also
held
that
before
it
was
at
lucas
flower
or
box,
so
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
you
think
it's
the
norris
laguardia
question?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understood
mr.
yablonski,
and
as
my
brother
white,
and
this
is
at
43
(a),
you
agreed
with
what
the
umpire
said
here
namely
that
although
the
company
has
not
made
any
charge
against
the
safety
committee,
and
i
gather
you
did
not.
unknown
speaker
the
union
states
that
it
feels
the
only
issue
which
can
be
arbitrated
in
this
hearing
is
whether
or
not
the
safety
committee
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
for
the
moment
the
regular
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract
does
not
reach
safety
disputes.
let's
just
assume
that
for
the
moment.
then
the
only
other
grounds
for
arbitration
is
the
safety
provisions
--
the
safety
clauses
itself.
unknown
speaker
which
are
limited
to
deciding
whether
the
safety
committee
acted
arbitrarily
or
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
under
another
provision
not
this
one.
unknown
speaker
but
it
refers
you
to
another
provision
that
the
--
unknown
speaker
in
only
what
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
only
reference
with
respect
to
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
but
is
that
an
issue
we
have
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
there
hadn't
in
fact
an
arbitration
in
this
case,
i'm
sure
your
position
would
be
that
is
for
an
arbitrator
to
decide
not
for
the
court?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
the
provisions
under
the
mine
safety
clauses
for
arbitration
weren't
triggered
because
the
company
didn't
challenge
this
safety
committee.
unknown
speaker
whatever
happened
to
those
criminal
charges,
mr.
scheinholtz?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
what
is
the
company's
position
with
respect
to
the
strike?
that
is
the
reason
for
it,
was
it
the
reinstatement
of
the
foreman,
or
was
it
the
earlier
company
position
not
to
allow
pay?
unknown
speaker
but
the
majority
didn't
say
that
the
arbitration

it

to
do

(a),
or
should
any
local
trouble
of
any
kind
arise
at
the
mine.
unknown
speaker
who
is
it
that
removes
members
of
the
committee
who
act
arbitrarily
and
capriciously?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
the
union
refuses
then
it
goes
to
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
and
the
issue
at
stake
then
is
whether
the
committee
acted
to
arbitrarily
or
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
but
does
these
provisions
contemplate
that
in
addition
to
caring
out
the
procedures
of
the
mine
safety
provisions
here
run
through
these
that
the
union
--
unknown
speaker
well,
wait
a
minute,
should
the
union
also
strike
while
these
provisions
are
going
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
these
provisions
themselves
say
only
if
the
mine
committee
determines
that
a
section
of
mine
is
unsafe
while
employees
be
removed
from
that
section.
unknown
speaker
or
the
union
before
that
determination
is
made
walk
out?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
how
about,
did
the
mine
safety
committee
act?
unknown
speaker
what
did
it
say?
unknown
speaker
and
did
it
do
this,
mr.
yablonski?
in
those
special
instances
where
the
committee
believes
an
immediate
danger
exists,
and
the
committee
recommends
that
the
management
remove
all
mine
workers
from
the
unsafe
area.
the
operators
required
to
follow
the
recommendation
of
the
committee?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
this
is
the
basic
language
upon
which
you
rely.
unknown
speaker
that
sentence
there
was
read
by
my
brother
brennan?
unknown
speaker
and
you,
i
take
it
before
the
arbitrator,
you
said
that
whether
or
not
the
committee
acted
arbitrarily
or
not
was
an
issue
open
to
arbitration?
i
take
it
that's
what
the
arbitrator
said.
the
union
states
that
it
feels
the
only
issue
which
can
be
arbitrated
in
this
hearing
is
whether
or
not
the
safety
committee
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
alright,
now
your
position
nevertheless
is
that
even
though
the
management
challenges
the
action
of
the
committee,
and
it
claims
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
therefore
the
issue
becomes
arbitrable.
you
claim
that
the
union
may
strike
pending
that
determination
of
whether
the
safety
committee
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
boys
market?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
issue
of
arbitrariness
or
capriciousness
of
the
committee
is
arbitrable.
unknown
speaker
and
pending
that
arbitration,
you
claim
that
boys
market
does
not
preventive
strike?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
really
relying
on
that?
well,
as
i
remember
some
years
now
mr.
yablonski,
i
wrote
benedict
coal.
and
i
think
as
i
recall
it,
and
the
national
agreement
had
no
strike
provision
at
all,
did
it?
and
we
divided
equally
as
i
remember,
i
think
justice
stewart
then
is
judge
stewart
as
i
recall
it
on
the
sixth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
when
there's
a
promise
to
arbitrate,
does
it
make
any
different
whether
the
contract
has
a
no
strike
clause
in
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
boys
market
sort
of
settled
in?
unknown
speaker
but
then
we
rather
--
i
don't
know
some
--
but
we've
also
held
that
before
it
was
at
lucas
flower
or
box,
so
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
you
think
it's
the
norris
laguardia
question?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understood
mr.
yablonski,
and
as
my
brother
white,
and
this
is
at
43
(a),
you
agreed
with
what
the
umpire
said
here
namely
that
although
the
company
has
not
made
any
charge
against
the
safety
committee,
and
i
gather
you
did
not.
unknown
speaker
the
union
states
that
it
feels
the
only
issue
which
can
be
arbitrated
in
this
hearing
is
whether
or
not
the
safety
committee
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
for
the
moment
the
regular
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract
does
not
reach
safety
disputes.
let's
just
assume
that
for
the
moment.
then
the
only
other
grounds
for
arbitration
is
the
safety
provisions
--
the
safety
clauses
itself.
unknown
speaker
which
are
limited
to
deciding
whether
the
safety
committee
acted
arbitrarily
or
capriciously.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
under
another
provision
not
this
one.
unknown
speaker
but
it
refers
you
to
another
provision
that
the
--
unknown
speaker
in
only
what
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
only
reference
with
respect
to
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
but
is
that
an
issue
we
have
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
there
hadn't
in
fact
an
arbitration
in
this
case,
i'm
sure
your
position
would
be
that
is
for
an
arbitrator
to
decide
not
for
the
court?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
the
provisions
under
the
mine
safety
clauses
for
arbitration
weren't
triggered
because
the
company
didn't
challenge
this
safety
committee.
