mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i'm
somewhat
appalled
that
counsel
has
indicated
to
this
court
precisely
what
he
thinks
about
norris
laguardia.
throughout
25
minutes
of
argument,
counsel
has
failed
to
even
mention
the
words
"the
norris
laguardia
act."
this
court
--
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
your
decision
in
boys
markets
should
be
extended
to
cover
a
safety
disputed
coal
mine.
this
court
carved
out
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
brennan.
very
limited
exception
the
norris
laguardia
act,
counsel
has
failed
to
even
mention
the
words
of
norris
laguardia
act.
the
basic
charter.
the
magna
carta
of
american
labor.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
the
coal
industry
and
particularly
the
gateway
mine.
not
once
in
counsel's
argument
has
he
mentioned
the
fact
the
gateway
mine
is
classified
by
the
united
states
bureau
of
mines
as
an
especially
hazardous
coal
mine.
not
once
has
he
mentioned
the
fact
that
at
that
mine,
there
is
liberated
daily
4
million
cubic
feet
of
deadly
methane
gas.
nor
does
counsel
mention
that
at
the
gateway
mine,
it's
one
of
the
largest
underground
mining
complexes
in
the
united
states.
that
the
failure
of
these
foreman
interrupted
the
airflow
to
the
five
phase
area
of
that
mine.
now,
counsel
has
said
here
that
their
regular
requirements
in
the
five
phase
area,
the
regular
ventilation
requirements
were
28,000
cubic
feet
per
minute
at
the
last
open
crosscut.
the
federal
minimum
ventilation
standard
is
9,000
cubic
feet
per
minute.
the
state
minimum
standard
is
6,000
cubic
feet.
it
gives
your
honor,
some
idea
of
the
gassy
nature
of
this
mine.
the
federal
bureau
of
mines
was
requiring
them
to
pump
three
times
the
minimum
amount
of
air
into
that
section.
the
law
requires
the
1969
coal
mining
health
and
safety
act,
requires
foreman
that
are
working
on
the
shift,
to
protect
the
safety
of
the
men
coming
into
the
mine,
to
make
a
pre-shift
examination.
that
inspection
must
be
carried
out
within
three
hours
prior
to
the
commencement
of
that
shift.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that
is
with
the
anemometer
your
honor.
that
inspection
should've
been
conducted
on
april
15th,
between
the
hours
of
5
a.m.
and
8
a.m.
these
foreman
purportedly
made
that
test
and
they
logged
into
their
logbooks
28,000
cubic
feet.
the
record
in
this
case
conclusively
demonstrates
that
this
overcast
fell
around
4
a.m.
in
the
morning.
counsel
would
now
seem
to
be
arguing
here
contesting
that
matter.
he
didn't
argue
it
in
the
district
court,
because
there
was
a
water
gauge
on
the
main
fan
of
that
mine.
and
when
that
resistance
was
created
when
that
overcast
fell,
it
showed
up
on
that
water
gauge.
this
conclusively
established
in
this
record
that
that
overcast
fell,
and
that
it
fell
before
the
foreman
were
required
to
make
their
pre-shift
examination
including
the
testing
for
ventilation.
now,
counsel
has
not
said
that
the
boys
markets
case
decided
by
this
court,
involved
in
economic
dispute.
the
question
before
this
court
as
you
recall,
was
whether
or
not
supervisors
were
performing
bargaining
unit
work
by
stocking
shelves
in
the
supermarket
in
california.
i
submit
to
you
your
honors
that
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
case
here
involves
coal
miners
and
the
words
of
justice
hastie,
"men
in
an
industry
which
is
dangerous
at
best."
this
mine
classified
by
the
federal
bureau
of
mines
as
especially
hazardous.
counsel
does
not
say
that
in
the
boys
markets
case,
it
was
admitted
before
this
court
that
the
grievance
could
be
submitted
--
should
have
been
submitted
to
arbitration.
here
there
is
a
very
serious
dispute
that
has
started
in
the
district
court
and
still
exists
here.
that
safety
disputes
are
not
arbitrable
under
the
1968
coal
wage
agreement.
now
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
preliminary
injunction
entered
by
the
district
court
your
honor,
and
a
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
a
reversal
by
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
reversal
by
the
united
states
court
of
the
third
circuit.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no,
we
were
not
defending
your
honor,
we
sought
to
have
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
also
awarded
us
your
honor,
to
submit
the
matter
to
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes
it
was.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
was
arbitrated.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
foreman
were
not
at
work.
the
foreman
returned
to
work
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no
they
will
return
to
work
your
honor,
after
the
arbitrator
ruled
that
they
could
be
returned.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that's
what
judge
mccune's
decision
permitted.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
were
ordered
to
go
to
arbitration
by
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
your
honor
we
had
judge
mccune's
order
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
time.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
didn't
get
a
stay.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes
we
did.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
asked
for
a
stay,
i
believe
your
honor,
after
the
umpire's
decision
came
down
we
sought
in
the
alternative
before
judge
mccune.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
went
to
arbitration
your
honor,
because
judge
mccune
required
us
to
arbitrate
within
60
days
this
issue.
we
did
not
want
to
go
to
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
did
appeal
judge
mccune's
order.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
sought
a
stay
after
the
arbitrator
had
ruled
your
honor.
we
sought
a
stay
of
the
return
of
the
men,
of
the
foreman
to
the
mine,
or
in
lieu
thereof,
we
sought
a
$5
million
bond.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
contested
through
a
lot,
your
honor,
that
safety
disputes
were
not
arbitrable.
we
resisted
the
submission
of
these
matters
to
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
under
this
agreement,
precisely.
your
honor,
has
hit
the
nail
precisely
on
the
head.
what
is
involved
here
is
a
construction
of
the
1968
agreement.
now
-?
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
precisely,
and
the
record
in
this
case
on
the
score
is
rather
clear.
the
president
of
our
district
four
testified
that
safety
disputes
had
not
been
arbitrated
under
the
68
wage
agreement.
the
company's
own
president,
gateway's
own
president
testified
that
gateway
had
never
arbitrated
a
case.
he
couldn't
speak
for
the
rest
of
the
coal
industry,
but
he
testified
that
gateway
had
never
arbitrated
a
safety
case.
the
record
in
this
case,
the
evidence
presented
to
the
district
court,
i
think
rather
conclusively
establishes
that.
now
brought
before
you
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
i
haven't
yet
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no
we
did
not.
we
believe
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
contention
that
these
matters
are
not
in
the
record.
we
believe
they
were
in
the
public
record,
and
they
may
be
observed
by
this
court.
the
sentrilya
hearings
which
were
conducted
in
1947,
incidentally
those
hearings
were
being
conducted
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
at
the
very
same
time
that
both
the
house
and
the
senate
were
considering
taft-hartley.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
ordered
us
to
submit
the
matter
to
arbitration
and
ordered
the
strike
terminated
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
at
that
particular
point
in
time,
the
foreman
had
not
been
returned
to
work.
we
did
not
have,
at
least
my
view
at
that
point,
the
kind
of
persuasive
argument
that
we
could
make
after
the
foreman
were
ordered
back.
a
court
might
say
you're
premature
in
coming
in
here
and
asking
for
a
stay.
we
don't
know
that
an
arbitrator
might
say
that
the
mine
will
be
rendered
unsafe.
we
waited
until
the
arbitrator's
award
came
down,
and
the
foreman
were
to
go
to
work
then
we
thought
we
had
a
right
issue
to
take
before
court
and
to
ask
for
a
stay.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
sought
it
and
were
denied
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
your
honor,
i
honestly
can't
say
that
we
applied
to
the
court
of
appeals,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
we
believe
we
did.
i
can
recall
arguing
the
matter
before
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
us
and
when
it
ultimately
reversed
we
sought
before
the
third
circuit
your
honor,
expeditious
oral
argument
under
the
norris
laguardia
act,
and
it
was
granted.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no,
i
can't
recall
your
honor,
whether
in
this
record
we
had
asked
the
court
of
appeals
since
then.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
i
would
assume
that
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
there
is
no
dovetailing
of
these
procedures.
i
think
counsel
for
the
petitioner's
indicated
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
one
is
an
administrative
proceeding
and
the
other
is
a
regular
routine
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
well,
your
honor,
nothing
surprises
me
after
i
had
petitioner's
president
on
stand
in
terms
of
the
administrative
procedure.
petitioner's
president
conceded
under
cross
examination
that
he
has
spoken
with
the
man
who
was
then
responsible
for
conducting
the
decertification
proceedings,
and
had
informed
him
that
gateway
was
suffering
a
foreman
shortage.
all
of
this
predated
the
letter
that
was
sent
to
gateway
saying
"you
could
send
these
foreman
back
to
work.
given
that
ex
parte
communication
between
gateway
and
the
administrative
agency,
your
honor,
nothing
would
surprise
me.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
your
honor,
i
did
not
appear.
no
counsel
can
appearl.
i
was
very
unfortunate
that
under
our
arbitration
system,
which
judge
mccune
ruled,
we
believe
incorrectly
so,
counsel
were
not
permitted
to
appear
at
any
stage
of
the
arbitration
at
process.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes.
the
umpire
or
arbitrator
can
be
counsel
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
i
think
at
the
very
outset
of
those
proceedings
the
union
contested
it.
now
counsel
says
that
the
arbitrator
found.
i
think,
in
reality,
what
the
arbitrator
did
was
simply
follow
judge
mccune's
decision.
the
arbitrator's
decision
is
before
you,
is
before
this
court.
it
is
before
this
court
despite
the
fact
that
counsel
sought
to
permit
that
to
submit
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
the
courts
of
appeals
struck
it
from
the
record.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
next
sentence
indicates
that
he
was
fairly
following
judge
mccune's
order
submitting
this
matter.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
we
did.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
i
would
also
direct
your
honor's,
attention
to
page
38
(a)
of
the
appendix
submitted
at
the
time
the
briefs
were
submitted,
and
it's
in
the
little
brown
book.
page
38
(a),
the
petitioner
sought
when
it
was
a
party
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
submit
the
arbitrator's
decision,
and
there
is
a
supplemental
appendix.
page
38
(a)
reveals
that
the
court
of
appeals,
order
signed
by
judge
colodner,
struck
from
the
record
the
arbitrator's
decision
that
nonetheless
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no,
i
don't
believe
that
this
opinion
is
ever
published
anywhere
your
honor.
a
question
was
raised
mr.
justice
blackmun,
regarding
this
being
a
spurious
safety
case
that
this
was
in
reality
a
reporting
pay
case.
this
was
adopted
by
judge
rosenn
in
all
cander
and
it
is
repeated
here
by
the
petitioner
and
by
amici
in
support
of
the
petitioner's
position.
point
of
fact,
counsel
has
admitted
that
the
reporting
pay
dispute
occurred
on
april
16th.
the
strike
which
resulted
in
the
commencement
of
this
litigation,
occurred
a
month
and
a
half
later.
it
appears
to
me
that
if
there
is
a
red
herring
in
this
case,
if
there
is
pre-text
being
argued
by
any
party,
it
is
not
by
the
respondent,
but
by
the
petitioner.
petitioner
has
dragged
in
this
reporting
pay,
in
the
appendix
in
this
case,
the
complaint
at
page
7
of
the
appendix,
in
paragraph
10
in
the
complaint,
the
petitioner
when
it
filed
his
complaint
in
court,
said
the
employee
members
of
the
defendants
have
notified
plaintiff
that
the
illegal
work
stoppage
occurred,
because
the
defendant
local
number
6330
had
passed
a
resolution.
that
it's
employee
members
would
not
work
with
certain
assistant
mine
foreman
designated
and
assigned
by
plaintiff,
to
act
as
supervisors
at
gateway
in
their
own
verified
complaint.
they
stated
exactly
what
we
are
asserting
right
now.
they
seem
to
have
abandoned
it.
in
addition
to
this
disjointed
time
frame
that
they
present
to
your
honors,
that
all
of
a
sudden
a
work
stoppage
which
occurred
a
month-and-a-half
later,
after
the
reporting
pay
dispute
occurred,
and
coincidently
exactly
at
the
same
time
these
foreman
were
returned
to
their
positions.
they
would
have
your
honors,
believe
that
they
lost
their
holiday
pay.
the
company
reinstated
these
foreman
on
the
day
following
a
holiday.
a
day
the
coal
miners
were
required
to
work
if
they
were
to
collect
their
holiday
pay.
they
would
have
you
believe
that
the
miners
forfeited
their
entire
holiday
pay,
forfeited
two
weeks
work
following
that.
some
$296,000
in
lost
wages,
because
of
a
dispute
involving
perhaps
a
hundred
men
over
four
hours
reporting
pay.
i
repeat,
if
there
is
a
red
herring,
if
there's
a
pretext
in
this
case,
we
are
not
asserting
it.
it's
the
petitioner
that's
asserting
it.
now,
basically
what
is
involved
here
is
the
construction
of
the
1968
agreement.
the
relevant
provisions
begin
at
page
10
of
the
appendix.
it
is
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes
appears
at
page
13.
it's
a
broad
grievance
procedure.
we
do
not
deny
that.
but
petitioner
would
appear
to
assert
that
if
there
are
no
limitations
appearing
in
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes,
then
there
are
none,
and
that
is
where
we
differ.
petitioner
acknowledges
the
fact
that
national
disputes
are
carved
out
in
another
section
of
this
agreement,
and
outside
the
grievance
procedure.
that
appears
at
page
15
(a).
what
we
are
submitting
is
that
mine
safety
disputes
are
carved
out,
and
made
a
separate
part,
separate
procedure.
under
the
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement,
two
committees
are
recognized
at
the
mines.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor,
while
they
begin
at
page
10
(a),
the
mine
safety
program.oh
yes,
where
the
comprehensive
program
runs
to
the
middle
part
of
13
(a).
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
i
believe
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
acknowledge
that
your
honor.
we
say
that
looking
at
the
agreement,
looking
at
the
establishment
of
two
separate
committees
at
the
mine,
you
will
note
in
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes
at
the
second
step
of
the
grievance
procedure.
the
dispute
is
between
mine
management
and
the
mine
committee,
refers
to
as
the
pit
committee
at
many
mines.
the
pit
committee
or
the
mine
committee
handles
grievances.
the
safety
committee
handles
safety.
when
this
agreement
was
set
up
at
the
local
union
level,
grievances
were
handled
by
the
mine
committee,
safety
disputes
were
handle
by
the
safety
committee.
now
drawing
your
honors,
you
can
construe
a
contract
many
different
ways,
and
look
at
the
four
corners
of
the
agreement.
look
at
the
interrelationship
of
the
provisions.
directing
your
attention
to
the
bottom
of
page
12
(a)
of
the
appendix
talks
about
what
can
occur
if
that
safety
committee
declares
an
imminent
danger
to
exist
on
a
section
of
the
mine
or
in
the
entire
mine.
the
safety
committee
in
closing
down
an
unsafe
area
acts
arbitrarily
and
capriciously,
members
of
the
committee
maybe
removed
from
the
committee.
grievances
that
may
arise
as
a
result
of
the
removal
or
request
for
removal
of
a
member
of
the
safety
committee
under
this
section,
shall
be
handled
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
providing
for
settlement
of
disputes.
we
submit
that
the
parties
including
that
last
sentence
in
there,
meant
to
say
that
everything
else
impliedly,
everything
else
in
the
mine
safety
program
that
precedes
that
is
exempt
and
outside
the
arbitration
provisions.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
the
local
union,
the
company
requests
that
that
be
done.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes.
but
that
is
the
only
thing
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
right,
for
which
they
may
only
be
removed
from
their
office.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
question
has
been
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
i
think
the
contract
your
honor,
contemplates
the
work
stoppage.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that's
right,
it
contemplates
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
question
the
counsel
has
raised,
and
i'm
that
he
raised
it.
here
we
did
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
safety
procedure.
we
requested
an
inspection
to
be
made
at
that
mine
by
federal
and
state
mine
inspectors.
the
mine
safety
committee
when
accompanied
them
on
that
trip,
they
reported
to
the
local
union,
the
grievous
violations
that
had
been
committed.
the
logging
of
improper
entries
the
falsification
of
entries
by
these
foremen.
they
supported
a
resolution
brought
before
the
entire
membership
that
they
would
not
work
with
these
foreman,
and
all
of
this
was
communicated
to
management.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor,
the
mine
safety
committee
did
act.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
made
the
tour.
it
reported
to
the
membership
of
the
local
union,
and
the
local
union,
and
the
words
of
judge
hastie
acting
as
a
committee
of
the
whole
declared
that
none
of
its
members
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
did
with
the
local
union
as
a
buffer
between
the
committee
and
the
mine
operator.
it
added
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
it
is
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
it
is.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that
is
the
only
thing
under
the
contract
with
safety
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
there
is
nothing,
your
honor,
in
the
contract
or
anything,
anywhere
else
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that
is
precisely
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
it
is,
and
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
what
i'm
claiming
your
honor,
is
that
pending
that
decision,
the
contract
gives
these
men
that
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
and
mr.
chief
justice
burger
wrote
the
dissent
in
the
district
of
columbia
case.
your
honor
that
was
one
of
the
questions
that
was
before
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
court
of
appeals
never
reached
that
question
or
exists
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
today.
the
third
circuits
never
passed
upon,
never
saw
a
foot
to
pass
upon
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
raised
and
litigated
the
question.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
your
honor,
i
thought
in
boys
markets
there
was
an
expressed
no
strike
clause,
here
there
is
none.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
in
lucas
flower.
the
issue,
your
honor,
in
interpreting
the
1968
agreement
is
that
there
exists
this
but
in
circuits.
we
do
not
believe
that
that's
a
question
before
this
court.
we
think
that
it's
a
contract
question.
we
think
that
judge
hastie's
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes
we
do,
your
honor.
because
this
court
said
in
boys
markets,
mr.
justice
brennan's
language,
was
that
you
created,
the
carved
out
a
very
limited
exception.
judge
hastie's
decision
is
supported
by
section
502
in
terms
of
public
policy.
it
is
supported
by
the
1969
federal
coal
mine
health
and
safety
act.
it
is
supported
by
the
occupational
health
and
safety
act
of
1970.
it
is
supported
by
the
common
law
of
the
shop.
it
is
emanated
in
arbitration
after
arbitration
since
the
seminal
decision
of
harry
schurman
and
the
ford
motor
company
case
as
far
back
as
1944.
all
of
these,
we
believe
support
judge
hastie's
conclusion
that
safety
disputes
are
sui
generis.
in
conclusion,
in
dealing
with
norris
laguardia,
your
honors,
and
boys
markets,
this
court
said
in
boys
markets
that
you
did
not,
and
i
am
quoting
“undermine
the
vitality
of
norris
laguardia”.
you
said
that
it
was
not
every
strike
over
an
arbitrable
matter
that
was
necessarily
enjoinable.
given
the
nature
of
the
contract
involved
herein,
the
nature
of
the
dispute,
the
relevant
public
policy
and
common
law
of
the
shop.
the
ordering
of
injunctive
relief
here
by
the
district
court
collides
with
the
most
fundamental
of
equity
principles.
if
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate
in
the
case
such
as
this,
then
surely
the
class
of
disputes
falling
outside
the
ambit
of
boys
markets
is
in
infinitesimal,
and
norris
laguardia
is
truly
a
dead
letter
during
the
contract
term.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i'm
somewhat
appalled
that
counsel
has
indicated
to
this
court
precisely
what
he
thinks
about
norris
laguardia.
throughout
25
minutes
of
argument,
counsel
has
failed
to
even
mention
the
words
"the
norris
laguardia
act."
this
court
--
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
your
decision
in
boys
markets
should
be
extended
to
cover
a
safety
disputed
coal
mine.
this
court
carved
out
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
brennan.
very
limited
exception
the
norris
laguardia
act,
counsel
has
failed
to
even
mention
the
words
of
norris
laguardia
act.
the
basic
charter.
the
magna
carta
of
american
labor.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
the
coal
industry
and
particularly
the
gateway
mine.
not
once
in
counsel's
argument
has
he
mentioned
the
fact
the
gateway
mine
is
classified
by
the
united
states
bureau
of
mines
as
an
especially
hazardous
coal
mine.
not
once
has
he
mentioned
the
fact
that
at
that
mine,
there
is
liberated
daily
4
million
cubic
feet
of
deadly
methane
gas.
nor
does
counsel
mention
that
at
the
gateway
mine,
it's
one
of
the
largest
underground
mining
complexes
in
the
united
states.
that
the
failure
of
these
foreman
interrupted
the
airflow
to
the
five
phase
area
of
that
mine.
now,
counsel
has
said
here
that
their
regular
requirements
in
the
five
phase
area,
the
regular
ventilation
requirements
were
28,000
cubic
feet
per
minute
at
the
last
open
crosscut.
the
federal
minimum
ventilation
standard
is
9,000
cubic
feet
per
minute.
the
state
minimum
standard
is
6,000
cubic
feet.
it
gives
your
honor,
some
idea
of
the
gassy
nature
of
this
mine.
the
federal
bureau
of
mines
was
requiring
them
to
pump
three
times
the
minimum
amount
of
air
into
that
section.
the
law
requires
the
1969
coal
mining
health
and
safety
act,
requires
foreman
that
are
working
on
the
shift,
to
protect
the
safety
of
the
men
coming
into
the
mine,
to
make
a
pre-shift
examination.
that
inspection
must
be
carried
out
within
three
hours
prior
to
the
commencement
of
that
shift.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that
is
with
the
anemometer
your
honor.
that
inspection
should've
been
conducted
on
april
15th,
between
the
hours
of
5
a.m.
and
8
a.m.
these
foreman
purportedly
made
that
test
and
they
logged
into
their
logbooks
28,000
cubic
feet.
the
record
in
this
case
conclusively
demonstrates
that
this
overcast
fell
around
4
a.m.
in
the
morning.
counsel
would
now
seem
to
be
arguing
here
contesting
that
matter.
he
didn't
argue
it
in
the
district
court,
because
there
was
a
water
gauge
on
the
main
fan
of
that
mine.
and
when
that
resistance
was
created
when
that
overcast
fell,
it
showed
up
on
that
water
gauge.
this
conclusively
established
in
this
record
that
that
overcast
fell,
and
that
it
fell
before
the
foreman
were
required
to
make
their
pre-shift
examination
including
the
testing
for
ventilation.
now,
counsel
has
not
said
that
the
boys
markets
case
decided
by
this
court,
involved
in
economic
dispute.
the
question
before
this
court
as
you
recall,
was
whether
or
not
supervisors
were
performing
bargaining
unit
work
by
stocking
shelves
in
the
supermarket
in
california.
i
submit
to
you
your
honors
that
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
case
here
involves
coal
miners
and
the
words
of
justice
hastie,
"men
in
an
industry
which
is
dangerous
at
best."
this
mine
classified
by
the
federal
bureau
of
mines
as
especially
hazardous.
counsel
does
not
say
that
in
the
boys
markets
case,
it
was
admitted
before
this
court
that
the
grievance
could
be
submitted
--
should
have
been
submitted
to
arbitration.
here
there
is
a
very
serious
dispute
that
has
started
in
the
district
court
and
still
exists
here.
that
safety
disputes
are
not
arbitrable
under
the
1968
coal
wage
agreement.
now
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
preliminary
injunction
entered
by
the
district
court
your
honor,
and
a
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
a
reversal
by
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
reversal
by
the
united
states
court
of
the
third
circuit.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no,
we
were
not
defending
your
honor,
we
sought
to
have
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
also
awarded
us
your
honor,
to
submit
the
matter
to
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes
it
was.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
was
arbitrated.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
foreman
were
not
at
work.
the
foreman
returned
to
work
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no
they
will
return
to
work
your
honor,
after
the
arbitrator
ruled
that
they
could
be
returned.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that's
what
judge
mccune's
decision
permitted.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
were
ordered
to
go
to
arbitration
by
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
your
honor
we
had
judge
mccune's
order
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
time.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
didn't
get
a
stay.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes
we
did.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
asked
for
a
stay,
i
believe
your
honor,
after
the
umpire's
decision
came
down
we
sought
in
the
alternative
before
judge
mccune.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
went
to
arbitration
your
honor,
because
judge
mccune
required
us
to
arbitrate
within
60
days
this
issue.
we
did
not
want
to
go
to
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
did
appeal
judge
mccune's
order.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
sought
a
stay
after
the
arbitrator
had
ruled
your
honor.
we
sought
a
stay
of
the
return
of
the
men,
of
the
foreman
to
the
mine,
or
in
lieu
thereof,
we
sought
a
$5
million
bond.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
contested
through
a
lot,
your
honor,
that
safety
disputes
were
not
arbitrable.
we
resisted
the
submission
of
these
matters
to
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
under
this
agreement,
precisely.
your
honor,
has
hit
the
nail
precisely
on
the
head.
what
is
involved
here
is
a
construction
of
the
1968
agreement.
now
-?
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
precisely,
and
the
record
in
this
case
on
the
score
is
rather
clear.
the
president
of
our
district
four
testified
that
safety
disputes
had
not
been
arbitrated
under
the
68
wage
agreement.
the
company's
own
president,
gateway's
own
president
testified
that
gateway
had
never
arbitrated
a
case.
he
couldn't
speak
for
the
rest
of
the
coal
industry,
but
he
testified
that
gateway
had
never
arbitrated
a
safety
case.
the
record
in
this
case,
the
evidence
presented
to
the
district
court,
i
think
rather
conclusively
establishes
that.
now
brought
before
you
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
i
haven't
yet
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no
we
did
not.
we
believe
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
contention
that
these
matters
are
not
in
the
record.
we
believe
they
were
in
the
public
record,
and
they
may
be
observed
by
this
court.
the
sentrilya
hearings
which
were
conducted
in
1947,
incidentally
those
hearings
were
being
conducted
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
at
the
very
same
time
that
both
the
house
and
the
senate
were
considering
taft-hartley.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
ordered
us
to
submit
the
matter
to
arbitration
and
ordered
the
strike
terminated
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
at
that
particular
point
in
time,
the
foreman
had
not
been
returned
to
work.
we
did
not
have,
at
least
my
view
at
that
point,
the
kind
of
persuasive
argument
that
we
could
make
after
the
foreman
were
ordered
back.
a
court
might
say
you're
premature
in
coming
in
here
and
asking
for
a
stay.
we
don't
know
that
an
arbitrator
might
say
that
the
mine
will
be
rendered
unsafe.
we
waited
until
the
arbitrator's
award
came
down,
and
the
foreman
were
to
go
to
work
then
we
thought
we
had
a
right
issue
to
take
before
court
and
to
ask
for
a
stay.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
sought
it
and
were
denied
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
your
honor,
i
honestly
can't
say
that
we
applied
to
the
court
of
appeals,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
we
believe
we
did.
i
can
recall
arguing
the
matter
before
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
us
and
when
it
ultimately
reversed
we
sought
before
the
third
circuit
your
honor,
expeditious
oral
argument
under
the
norris
laguardia
act,
and
it
was
granted.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no,
i
can't
recall
your
honor,
whether
in
this
record
we
had
asked
the
court
of
appeals
since
then.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
i
would
assume
that
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
there
is
no
dovetailing
of
these
procedures.
i
think
counsel
for
the
petitioner's
indicated
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
one
is
an
administrative
proceeding
and
the
other
is
a
regular
routine
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
well,
your
honor,
nothing
surprises
me
after
i
had
petitioner's
president
on
stand
in
terms
of
the
administrative
procedure.
petitioner's
president
conceded
under
cross
examination
that
he
has
spoken
with
the
man
who
was
then
responsible
for
conducting
the
decertification
proceedings,
and
had
informed
him
that
gateway
was
suffering
a
foreman
shortage.
all
of
this
predated
the
letter
that
was
sent
to
gateway
saying
"you
could
send
these
foreman
back
to
work.
given
that
ex
parte
communication
between
gateway
and
the
administrative
agency,
your
honor,
nothing
would
surprise
me.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
your
honor,
i
did
not
appear.
no
counsel
can
appearl.
i
was
very
unfortunate
that
under
our
arbitration
system,
which
judge
mccune
ruled,
we
believe
incorrectly
so,
counsel
were
not
permitted
to
appear
at
any
stage
of
the
arbitration
at
process.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes.
the
umpire
or
arbitrator
can
be
counsel
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
i
think
at
the
very
outset
of
those
proceedings
the
union
contested
it.
now
counsel
says
that
the
arbitrator
found.
i
think,
in
reality,
what
the
arbitrator
did
was
simply
follow
judge
mccune's
decision.
the
arbitrator's
decision
is
before
you,
is
before
this
court.
it
is
before
this
court
despite
the
fact
that
counsel
sought
to
permit
that
to
submit
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
the
courts
of
appeals
struck
it
from
the
record.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
next
sentence
indicates
that
he
was
fairly
following
judge
mccune's
order
submitting
this
matter.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
we
did.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
i
would
also
direct
your
honor's,
attention
to
page
38
(a)
of
the
appendix
submitted
at
the
time
the
briefs
were
submitted,
and
it's
in
the
little
brown
book.
page
38
(a),
the
petitioner
sought
when
it
was
a
party
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
submit
the
arbitrator's
decision,
and
there
is
a
supplemental
appendix.
page
38
(a)
reveals
that
the
court
of
appeals,
order
signed
by
judge
colodner,
struck
from
the
record
the
arbitrator's
decision
that
nonetheless
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no,
i
don't
believe
that
this
opinion
is
ever
published
anywhere
your
honor.
a
question
was
raised
mr.
justice
blackmun,
regarding
this
being
a
spurious
safety
case
that
this
was
in
reality
a
reporting
pay
case.
this
was
adopted
by
judge
rosenn
in
all
cander
and
it
is
repeated
here
by
the
petitioner
and
by
amici
in
support
of
the
petitioner's
position.
point
of
fact,
counsel
has
admitted
that
the
reporting
pay
dispute
occurred
on
april
16th.
the
strike
which
resulted
in
the
commencement
of
this
litigation,
occurred
a
month
and
a
half
later.
it
appears
to
me
that
if
there
is
a
red
herring
in
this
case,
if
there
is
pre-text
being
argued
by
any
party,
it
is
not
by
the
respondent,
but
by
the
petitioner.
petitioner
has
dragged
in
this
reporting
pay,
in
the
appendix
in
this
case,
the
complaint
at
page
7
of
the
appendix,
in
paragraph
10
in
the
complaint,
the
petitioner
when
it
filed
his
complaint
in
court,
said
the
employee
members
of
the
defendants
have
notified
plaintiff
that
the
illegal
work
stoppage
occurred,
because
the
defendant
local
number
6330
had
passed
a
resolution.
that
it's
employee
members
would
not
work
with
certain
assistant
mine
foreman
designated
and
assigned
by
plaintiff,
to
act
as
supervisors
at
gateway
in
their
own
verified
complaint.
they
stated
exactly
what
we
are
asserting
right
now.
they
seem
to
have
abandoned
it.
in
addition
to
this
disjointed
time
frame
that
they
present
to
your
honors,
that
all
of
a
sudden
a
work
stoppage
which
occurred
a
month-and-a-half
later,
after
the
reporting
pay
dispute
occurred,
and
coincidently
exactly
at
the
same
time
these
foreman
were
returned
to
their
positions.
they
would
have
your
honors,
believe
that
they
lost
their
holiday
pay.
the
company
reinstated
these
foreman
on
the
day
following
a
holiday.
a
day
the
coal
miners
were
required
to
work
if
they
were
to
collect
their
holiday
pay.
they
would
have
you
believe
that
the
miners
forfeited
their
entire
holiday
pay,
forfeited
two
weeks
work
following
that.
some
$296,000
in
lost
wages,
because
of
a
dispute
involving
perhaps
a
hundred
men
over
four
hours
reporting
pay.
i
repeat,
if
there
is
a
red
herring,
if
there's
a
pretext
in
this
case,
we
are
not
asserting
it.
it's
the
petitioner
that's
asserting
it.
now,
basically
what
is
involved
here
is
the
construction
of
the
1968
agreement.
the
relevant
provisions
begin
at
page
10
of
the
appendix.
it
is
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes
appears
at
page
13.
it's
a
broad
grievance
procedure.
we
do
not
deny
that.
but
petitioner
would
appear
to
assert
that
if
there
are
no
limitations
appearing
in
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes,
then
there
are
none,
and
that
is
where
we
differ.
petitioner
acknowledges
the
fact
that
national
disputes
are
carved
out
in
another
section
of
this
agreement,
and
outside
the
grievance
procedure.
that
appears
at
page
15
(a).
what
we
are
submitting
is
that
mine
safety
disputes
are
carved
out,
and
made
a
separate
part,
separate
procedure.
under
the
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement,
two
committees
are
recognized
at
the
mines.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor,
while
they
begin
at
page
10
(a),
the
mine
safety
program.oh
yes,
where
the
comprehensive
program
runs
to
the
middle
part
of
13
(a).
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
i
believe
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
acknowledge
that
your
honor.
we
say
that
looking
at
the
agreement,
looking
at
the
establishment
of
two
separate
committees
at
the
mine,
you
will
note
in
the
settlement
of
local
and
district
disputes
at
the
second
step
of
the
grievance
procedure.
the
dispute
is
between
mine
management
and
the
mine
committee,
refers
to
as
the
pit
committee
at
many
mines.
the
pit
committee
or
the
mine
committee
handles
grievances.
the
safety
committee
handles
safety.
when
this
agreement
was
set
up
at
the
local
union
level,
grievances
were
handled
by
the
mine
committee,
safety
disputes
were
handle
by
the
safety
committee.
now
drawing
your
honors,
you
can
construe
a
contract
many
different
ways,
and
look
at
the
four
corners
of
the
agreement.
look
at
the
interrelationship
of
the
provisions.
directing
your
attention
to
the
bottom
of
page
12
(a)
of
the
appendix
talks
about
what
can
occur
if
that
safety
committee
declares
an
imminent
danger
to
exist
on
a
section
of
the
mine
or
in
the
entire
mine.
the
safety
committee
in
closing
down
an
unsafe
area
acts
arbitrarily
and
capriciously,
members
of
the
committee
maybe
removed
from
the
committee.
grievances
that
may
arise
as
a
result
of
the
removal
or
request
for
removal
of
a
member
of
the
safety
committee
under
this
section,
shall
be
handled
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
providing
for
settlement
of
disputes.
we
submit
that
the
parties
including
that
last
sentence
in
there,
meant
to
say
that
everything
else
impliedly,
everything
else
in
the
mine
safety
program
that
precedes
that
is
exempt
and
outside
the
arbitration
provisions.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
the
local
union,
the
company
requests
that
that
be
done.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes.
but
that
is
the
only
thing
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
right,
for
which
they
may
only
be
removed
from
their
office.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
question
has
been
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
i
think
the
contract
your
honor,
contemplates
the
work
stoppage.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that's
right,
it
contemplates
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
no,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
question
the
counsel
has
raised,
and
i'm
that
he
raised
it.
here
we
did
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
safety
procedure.
we
requested
an
inspection
to
be
made
at
that
mine
by
federal
and
state
mine
inspectors.
the
mine
safety
committee
when
accompanied
them
on
that
trip,
they
reported
to
the
local
union,
the
grievous
violations
that
had
been
committed.
the
logging
of
improper
entries
the
falsification
of
entries
by
these
foremen.
they
supported
a
resolution
brought
before
the
entire
membership
that
they
would
not
work
with
these
foreman,
and
all
of
this
was
communicated
to
management.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
your
honor,
the
mine
safety
committee
did
act.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
made
the
tour.
it
reported
to
the
membership
of
the
local
union,
and
the
local
union,
and
the
words
of
judge
hastie
acting
as
a
committee
of
the
whole
declared
that
none
of
its
members
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
it
did
with
the
local
union
as
a
buffer
between
the
committee
and
the
mine
operator.
it
added
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
it
is
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
it
is.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that
is
the
only
thing
under
the
contract
with
safety
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
there
is
nothing,
your
honor,
in
the
contract
or
anything,
anywhere
else
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
that
is
precisely
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes,
it
is,
and
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
what
i'm
claiming
your
honor,
is
that
pending
that
decision,
the
contract
gives
these
men
that
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
and
mr.
chief
justice
burger
wrote
the
dissent
in
the
district
of
columbia
case.
your
honor
that
was
one
of
the
questions
that
was
before
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
court
of
appeals
never
reached
that
question
or
exists
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
today.
the
third
circuits
never
passed
upon,
never
saw
a
foot
to
pass
upon
it.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
we
raised
and
litigated
the
question.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
your
honor,
i
thought
in
boys
markets
there
was
an
expressed
no
strike
clause,
here
there
is
none.
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
in
lucas
flower.
the
issue,
your
honor,
in
interpreting
the
1968
agreement
is
that
there
exists
this
but
in
circuits.
we
do
not
believe
that
that's
a
question
before
this
court.
we
think
that
it's
a
contract
question.
we
think
that
judge
hastie's
--
mr.
joseph
a.
yablonski
yes
we
do,
your
honor.
because
this
court
said
in
boys
markets,
mr.
justice
brennan's
language,
was
that
you
created,
the
carved
out
a
very
limited
exception.
judge
hastie's
decision
is
supported
by
section
502
in
terms
of
public
policy.
it
is
supported
by
the
1969
federal
coal
mine
health
and
safety
act.
it
is
supported
by
the
occupational
health
and
safety
act
of
1970.
it
is
supported
by
the
common
law
of
the
shop.
it
is
emanated
in
arbitration
after
arbitration
since
the
seminal
decision
of
harry
schurman
and
the
ford
motor
company
case
as
far
back
as
1944.
all
of
these,
we
believe
support
judge
hastie's
conclusion
that
safety
disputes
are
sui
generis.
in
conclusion,
in
dealing
with
norris
laguardia,
your
honors,
and
boys
markets,
this
court
said
in
boys
markets
that
you
did
not,
and
i
am
quoting
“undermine
the
vitality
of
norris
laguardia”.
you
said
that
it
was
not
every
strike
over
an
arbitrable
matter
that
was
necessarily
enjoinable.
given
the
nature
of
the
contract
involved
herein,
the
nature
of
the
dispute,
the
relevant
public
policy
and
common
law
of
the
shop.
the
ordering
of
injunctive
relief
here
by
the
district
court
collides
with
the
most
fundamental
of
equity
principles.
if
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate
in
the
case
such
as
this,
then
surely
the
class
of
disputes
falling
outside
the
ambit
of
boys
markets
is
in
infinitesimal,
and
norris
laguardia
is
truly
a
dead
letter
during
the
contract
term.
thank
you.
