justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn’t
judge
riley’s
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
give
the
impression
that
rule
of
the
superior
court
permits
the
raising
of
that
claim
as
a
defense
only,
but
that
if
you
want
a
money
judgment
on
your
counterclaim,
you
have
to
simply
pursue
a
different
remedy
in
the
superior
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
but
the
court
of
appeals
has
interpreted
that
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you’re
not
asking
us
at
any
rate
to
second
guess
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
the
rule
of
the
superior
court
reads,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that’s
just
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
rule
didn’t
mean,
as
i
read
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn’t
it
more
accurate
to
say
that
congress
thought
the
constitution
gave
a
right
to
the
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
miller,
i
understand
your
opponents’
contention
to
be
this
really
isn’t
a
summary
action
in
the
classic
sense
of
the
word,
that
the
rule
itself
allows
the
pleading
of
these
defenses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don’t
challenge
rule
5
(c),
do
you,
as
being
governing
in
a
case
like
this
unless
there’s
a
constitutional
impediment
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
tenant
fails
to
put
the
money
into
escrow
in
a
given
month?
what
consequences
befall
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
effect,
a
default
a
judgment
on
the
landlord’s
complaint?
