mr.
herman
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
mem
--
and
the
court.
in
connection
with
this
particular
question,
i
might
say
that
the
statute
was
repealed
in
1970.
the
statute
was
passed
by
congress
in
1921.
when
the
district
columbia
took
the
maryland
law
in
1899,
they
took
it
as
they
saw
it
in
that
particular
time
and,
the
question
about
forcible
entry
and
detainer
was
a
modern
method
then
to
get
possession.
they
have,
of
course,
ejectment
actions,
but
most
of
the
time,
they
use
a
forcible
entry
and
detainer.
this
was
not
a
jury
trial
because
it
was
referred
to
two
justices
of
the
peace
or
commissioners
who
had
no
right
to
instruct
the
jury,
had
no
right
to
grant
a
new
trial,
or
tell
the
jury
what
the
law
was.
now,
this
continued
on
until
1964
when
a
statute
was
passed,
giving
the
supreme
court
at
that
time
a
right
to
hear
these
cases
de
novo
and
a
jury
trial
in
the
supreme
court
if
there
was
a
loss
in
the
justices
of
the
peace
court.
mr.
herman
miller
in
1964.
i’m
sorry,
1864.
mr.
herman
miller
now,
this
continued
on
until
the
hof
case
was
decided
where
a
comprehensive
discussion
and
review
of
the
historical
situation
was
made
by
mr.
justice
story.
and,
it
was
held
at
that
time
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
not
a
common
law
court.
it
was
not
a
court
of
law
because
of
the
fact
that
i’ve
just
mentioned
and
decided
that
since
the
second
part
of
the
amendment
said
that
no
facts
should
be
reviewed
another
court,
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
it
was
review
of
the
facts
in
the
supreme
court
and,
it
was
held
that
though
there
was
a
hearing
and
a
trial
before
the
justices
of
the
peace
this
was
not
a
common
law
action
and,
therefore,
was
not
a
review.
this
went
on,
as
i
said,
until
1921
with
the
de
novo
proceedings.
now,
it
was
then
when
there
was
a
reorganization
of
the
court.
and
the
municipal
court
came
into
being,
giving
the
rights
and
power
to
pass
on
slander
and
tort
actions
and
so
forth,
that
they,
pardon
me
--
that
they
passed
the
law
to
state
that
a
jury
trial
will
be
had
in
cases
involving
possession.
it's
almost
a
repetitious
of
the
seventeenth
--
seventh
amendment.
all
the
language
of
the
seventh
amendment
was
there
plus
in
all
actions
involving
possession.
so,
congress
gave
the
court
the
right
to
hear
cases
involving
possession
with
a
jury
trial
and
took
it
away
in
1970.
congress,
having
the
power
to
give
it,
has
certainly
the
power
to
take
it
away.
now,
whatever
may
be
the
reason
it
was
taken
away,
the
fact
is
there’s
no
more
jury
trials
in
landlord
and
tenant
cases.
i
might
say
in
that
same
connection
that,
although
there
was
some
attempt
to
the
short
analogy
with
respect
to
ejectment,
the
ejectment
statute
is
still
on
the
books.
it’s
a
cumbersome
method.
it
requires
a
number
of
elements
to
be
shown
before
you
can
have
ejectment.
you
have
to
show
title.
you
also
have
to
give
the
tenant
a
right
to
redeem
in
six
months
and
causes
a
lot
of
damage
and
a
lot
of
harm.
so,
there’s
no
similarity
between
that
and
ejectment.
with
respect
to
the
other
two,
it
has
to
do
with
the
justice
of
the
peace.
you
still
couldn’t
get
any
common
law
trial
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
because
they
were
not
a
court.
now,
we
got
the
statute
of
19
--
mr.
herman
miller
you
could
have
it
on
a
trial
de
novo
--
mr.
herman
miller
yes,
in
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
herman
miller
well,
in
that
connection,
that
was
repealed
in
1921.
in
1921,
they
gave
the
municipal
court,
which
was
generally
the
organizations
of
that
court,
the
right
to
hear
jury
trials
--
mr.
herman
miller
this
was
a
statutory
proceeding.
it
does
not
exist
in
1799
in
england,
and
had
no
relevancy
between
the
two
procedures.
there
was
no
trial
de
novo
in
england
and
was
--
mr.
herman
miller
no,
because
of
the
number
of
cases
showing
that
there
was
no
common
law
court
in
which
such
an
action
could
be
had
before
a
jury.
mr.
herman
miller
this
was
a
statutory
proceeding
in
1864.
it
never
existed
before
that
particular
date.
so,
therefore,
it
couldn’t
have
been
in
existence
in
england
in
1799
when
the
matter
first
came
to
the
attention
of
the
district
of
columbia.
so,
i
don’t
see
how
they
could
they
say
that
you
had
a
jury
trial
at
that
particular
time
as
a
result
of
legislation
and
not
common
law.
there
was
no
common
law
right
to
it.
before
the
hof
case
said
that
there
was
no
common
law
proceeding
in
such
a
--
i’m
sorry,
such
a
proceeding.
and,
the
only
kind
of
a
jury
trial
you
could
have
is
before
the
commissioners
who
merely
drew
the
12
men
and
had
no
right
to
instruct
the
jury
to
do
otherwise.
now
in
1921,
as
i
say,
the
right
was
given
to
the
municipal
court
and
then
it
was
taken
away.
now
with
respect
to
the
second
point
made
by
the
petitioner
that
because
he
has
filed
a
counterclaim,
recoupment
is
set-off,
this
gives
him
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
of
course,
if
that
is
so,
that
would
be
present
in
every
one
of
these
122,000
cases.
such
a
claim
could
be
made
in
that
and
deprive
the
landlord
of
his
property
while
the
tenant
litigates
what
he
claims
to
be
his
rights,
as
criticized
by
this
court
in
the
normet
case.
the
normet
case
said
that
the
landlord
shouldn’t
be
required
to
stand
by
while
he
litigates
those
things.
and
when
you
go
into
that
particular
branch
of
the
procedure,
there’ll
be
discovery
and
all
kinds
of
reasons
for
delay.
my
experience
had
been,
and
i
guess
i
had
more
of
landlord
and
tenant
cases
than
anybody
in
the
city.
that
these
land
--
when
we
did
had
a
jury
right
under
13702,
the
jury
claim
was
made
and
interposed
merely
for
delay
because
practically
every
one
of
the
cases
at
least
result
in
a
tenant
moving
out
owing
four
or
five
months
rent
or
a
settlement
of
some
kind.
and,
as
i
am
informed
by
the
clerk,
that
out
of
600-somewhat
cases
juries
demands
were
made,
there
are
only
six
that
were
tried
in
the
last
year
before
the
abolition
of
the
jury
system
by
this
particular
case.
now
it
is
also
shown,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
creation
of
the
right
to
claim
the
money
for
violations
of
the
housing
regulations
in
javins
was
never
recognized
by
the
javins
case
as
a
legal
claim.
it
was
purely
an
equitable
claim.
and
on
page
19
of
the
amicus
curiae
brief,
there
is
a
referral
by
judge
wright
as
to
what
had
happened
with
respect
to
the
doctrine,
and
it
concludes
by
this
language.
“a
remedy
for
every
wrong
is
not
cognizable
by
the
courts
of
law
and
the
complexities
of
the
present
so
sure
have
brought
about
conditions
which
were
unknown
when
the
english
courts
of
equity
was
established.
it
was
realized
and
the
lower
court’s
decision
was
on
the
basis
that
when
a
claim
of
this
type
is
made,
it’s
purely
equitable
because
in
the
cited
case
of
molyneaux
versus
townhouse,
the
claim
for
non-payment
of
rent
is
made
and
if
the
tenant
can
show
he
paid
the
rent
or
he
had
a
right
to
pay
it,
this
would
give
him
a
right
to
equitable
conversion
and
have
his
tenancy
reestablished.”
in
other
words,
it
was
purely
a
suit
as
to
whether
the
rent
was
due.
if
the
rent
was
due,
he,
the
tenant
had
a
right
to
tender
all
the
rents
and
that,
would
reinstate
his
tenancy.
so,
that
was
all
purely
equitable0
and
the
defense’s
recoupment
is
set-off
and
counterclaim
were
considered
by
the
lower
court
as
being
purely
equitable
in
nature
and
therefore
not
triable
by
a
jury.
and,
therefore,
the
dairy
queen
case
has
no
application
because,
there,
the
issues
were
legal
and
equitable
and
here
they
are
purely
equitable.
to
show,
with
respect
to
a
jury
trial,
the
summary
action
would
be
destroyed
completely.
the
code
title
16-1501
makes
the
complaint
returnable
in
seven
clear
days.
it
is
only
necessary
if
you
cannot
find
the
defendant
to
post
a
summons
on
the
door.
mr.
herman
miller
you
mean
rule
5?
mr.
herman
miller
well,
i
have
some
difficulty
with
rule
5.
although
it
was
not
mentioned
in
my
brief,
it
does
not
do
complete
justice.
as
recited
rule,
the
rule
3
allows
the
landlord
to
ask
for
a
personal
money
judgment
if
the
tenant
makes
a
claim
for
recoupment
set-off
and
counterclaim.
but,
in
footnote
number
64
in
the
javins
case,
it
has
been
said
that
if
the
tenant
caused
the
damage,
then
this
was
not
be
a
defense
of
the
landlord’s
claim.
now,
if
the
tenant
caused
the
damage,
the
landlord
has
a
right
of
action
for
that
damage.
he
can’t
make
it
in
this
particular
claim
because
there’s
no
provision
in
the
rule.
then,
he’s
got
to
file
his
own
independent
action
to
make
his
claim
while
the
tenant
goes
ahead
with
his
claim
and
it
is
tried
it
seems
to
me.
in
order
to
have
a
due
process
situation,
all
the
claims
should
be
litigated
in
one
particular
action
and
this
cannot
be
done
under
rule
5
(c)
and
that’s
--
mr.
herman
miller
i
say
that
that
may
be
in
opposed
but
not
in
a
jury
trial,
instead,
enlarge
the
remedy
to
a
jury
trial.
the
tenant
may
file
these
kinds
of
claims
in
the
particular
action,
have
a
court
trial
and
if
he
can
show
by
these
defenses
that
there’s
no
rent
due,
the
case
of
the
landlord
falls.
that
would
be
the
end
of
it,
but
to
litigate
these
kinds
of
things
to
a
full
blown
action
of
law
would
destroy
the
summary
nature
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
herman
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
mem
--
and
the
court.
in
connection
with
this
particular
question,
i
might
say
that
the
statute
was
repealed
in
1970.
the
statute
was
passed
by
congress
in
1921.
when
the

the
question

possession.
they
have,
of
course,
ejectment
actions,
but
most
of
the
time,
they
use
a
forcible
entry
and
detainer.
this
was

mr.
herman
miller
in
1964.
i’m
sorry,
1864.
mr.
herman

now,
this
continued
on
until
the
hof

was
decided
where
a

that

it
away
in

congress,
having
the
power
to
give
it,
has
certainly
the
power
to
take
it
away.
now,
whatever
may
be
the
reason
it
was
taken
away,
the
fact
is
there’s
no
more
jury
trials
in
landlord

because
they

now,
we
got
the

of
19
--
mr.
herman

you
could
have
it
on

--
mr.

yes,

--
mr.

that
was

and
had
no

between
the
two
procedures.
there
was
no
trial
de

in

and
was
--
mr.

no,
because
of
the
number
of
cases
showing
that
there
was
no

in
which
such
an
action
could
be

mr.
herman

this
was

1864.
it
never
existed
before
that
particular
date.
so,
therefore,

1921,
as
i
say,
the
right
was
given
to
the
municipal
court
and
then
it
was
taken
away.
now
with
respect
to
the
second
point
made
by
the
petitioner
that
because
he
has
filed
a
counterclaim,
recoupment
is
set-off,
this
gives
him
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
of
course,
if
that
is
so,
that
would
be
present
in
every
one
of
these
122,000
cases.
such
a
claim
could
be
made
in
that
and
deprive
the
landlord
of
his
property
while
the
tenant
litigates
what
he
claims
to
be
his
rights,
as
criticized
by
this
court
in
the
normet
case.
the
normet
case
said
that
the
landlord
shouldn’t
be
required
to
stand
by
while
he
litigates
those
things.
and
when
you
go
into
that
particular
branch
of
the
procedure,
there’ll
be
discovery
and
all
kinds
of
reasons
for
delay.
my
experience
had
been,
and
i
guess
i
had
more
of
landlord
and
tenant
cases
than
anybody
in
the
city.
that
these
land
--
when
we
did
had
a
jury
right
under
13702,
the
jury
claim
was
made
and
interposed
merely
for
delay
because
practically
every
one
of
the
cases
at
least
result
in
a
tenant
moving
out
owing
four
or
five
months
rent
or
a
settlement
of
some
kind.
and,
as
i
am
informed
by
the
clerk,
that
out
of
600-somewhat
cases
juries
demands
were
made,
there
are
only
six
that
were
tried
in
the
last
year
before
the
abolition
of
the
jury
system
by
this
particular
case.
now
it
is
also
shown,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
creation
of
the
right
to
claim
the
money
for
violations
of
the
housing
regulations
in
javins
was
never
recognized
by
the
javins
case
as
a
legal
claim.
it
was
purely
an
equitable
claim.
and
on
page
19
of
the
amicus
curiae
brief,
there
is
a
referral
by
judge
wright
as
to
what
had
happened
with
respect
to
the
doctrine,
and
it
concludes
by
this
language.
“a
remedy
for
every
wrong
is
not
cognizable
by
the
courts
of
law
and
the
complexities
of
the
present
so
sure
have
brought
about
conditions
which
were
unknown
when
the
english
courts
of
equity
was
established.
it
was
realized
and
the
lower
court’s
decision
was
on
the
basis
that
when
a
claim
of
this
type
is
made,
it’s
purely
equitable
because
in
the
cited
case
of
molyneaux
versus
townhouse,
the
claim
for
non-payment
of
rent
is
made
and
if
the
tenant
can
show
he
paid
the
rent
or
he
had
a
right
to
pay
it,
this
would
give
him
a
right
to
equitable
conversion
and
have
his
tenancy
reestablished.”
in
other
words,
it
was
purely
a
suit
as
to
whether
the
rent
was
due.
if
the
rent
was
due,
he,
the
tenant
had
a
right
to
tender
all
the
rents
and
that,
would
reinstate
his
tenancy.
so,
that
was
all
purely
equitable0
and
the
defense’s
recoupment
is
set-off
and
counterclaim
were
considered
by
the
lower
court
as
being
purely
equitable
in
nature
and
therefore
not
triable
by
a
jury.
and,
therefore,
the
dairy
queen
case
has
no
application
because,
there,
the
issues
were
legal
and
equitable
and
here
they
are
purely
equitable.
to
show,
with
respect
to
a
jury
trial,
the
summary
action
would
be
destroyed
completely.
the
code
title
16-1501
makes
the
complaint
returnable
in
seven
clear
days.
it
is
only
necessary
if
you
cannot
find
the
defendant
to
post
a
summons
on
the
door.
mr.
herman
miller
you
mean
rule
5?
mr.
herman
miller
well,
i
have
some
difficulty
with
rule
5.
although
it
was
not
mentioned
in
my
brief,
it
does
not
do
complete
justice.
as
recited
rule,
the
rule
3
allows
the
landlord
to
ask
for
a
personal
money
judgment
if
the
tenant
makes
a
claim
for
recoupment
set-off
and
counterclaim.
but,
in
footnote
number
64
in
the
javins
case,
it
has
been
said
that
if
the
tenant
caused
the
damage,
then
this
was
not
be
a
defense
of
the
landlord’s
claim.
now,
if
the
tenant
caused
the
damage,
the
landlord
has
a
right
of
action
for
that
damage.
he
can’t
make
it
in
this
particular
claim
because
there’s
no
provision
in
the
rule.
then,
he’s
got
to
file
his
own
independent
action
to
make
his
claim
while
the
tenant
goes
ahead
with
his
claim
and
it
is
tried
it
seems
to
me.
in
order
to
have
a
due
process
situation,
all
the
claims
should
be
litigated
in
one
particular
action
and
this
cannot
be
done
under
rule
5
(c)
and
that’s
--
mr.
herman
miller
i
say
that
that
may
be
in
opposed
but
not
in
a
jury
trial,
instead,
enlarge
the
remedy
to
a
jury
trial.
the
tenant
may
file
these
kinds
of
claims
in
the
particular
action,
have
a
court
trial
and
if
he
can
show
by
these
defenses
that
there’s
no
rent
due,
the
case
of
the
landlord
falls.
that
would
be
the
end
of
it,
but
to
litigate
these
kinds
of
things
to
a
full
blown
action
of
law
would
destroy
the
summary
nature
of
the
proceeding.
