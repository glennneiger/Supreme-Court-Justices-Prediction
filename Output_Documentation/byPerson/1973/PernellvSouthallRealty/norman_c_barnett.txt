mr.
norman
c.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
present
case
comes
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
and
it
presents
the
question
of
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
an
action
brought
by
a
landlord
to
recover
possession
of
real
property
pursuant
to
the
district
of
columbia
statutory
eviction
proceeding
and,
also
it
raises
the
question
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
tenant’s
counter
claims
for
money
damages
brought
in
that
same
proceeding.
briefly
stated,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows.
in
august
of
1971,
the
respondent
landlord
sued
the
petitioner
for
possession
of
premises
held
under
a
lease
alleging
non-payment
of
rent
for
a
three-month
period.
on
the
answer
day,
the
tenant
filed
an
answer
denying
that
any
rent
was
owed
because
of
the
failure
of
the
landlord
to
maintain
the
premises
in
compliance
with
the
district
of
columbia
housing
regulations.
the
case
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
administrative
regulations
there
permit
a
tenant
to
raise
this
defense
at
a
possessory
action.
the
tenant
also
filed
affirmative
claims
seeking
a
money
judgment
for
expenses
incurred
by
him
to
repair
the
premises
and
for
return
of
rent
paid
while
the
landlord
was
in
breach
of
his
warranty.
the
applicable
rules
of
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
permit
the
tenant
to
raise
these
affirmative
defenses.
at
the
same
time,
on
the
answer
day,
the
tenant
demanded
a
trial
by
jury,
paid
the
requisite
fees,
and
complied
with
all
necessary
requirements
for
demand
of
jury
trial.
the
trial
judge
struck
the
jury
demand
over
the
objection
of
the
tenant
that
he
was
constitutionally
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury.
the
case
was
subsequently
tried
by
the
court
and
the
judgment
for
possession
was
rendered
for
the
landlord.
on
appeal,
the
court
below
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
holding
that
congress,
in
1970,
had
repealed
the
statutory
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
these
eviction
proceedings
and
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
seventh
amendment
in
such
proceedings.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
i
would
think
that
they
did,
your
honor.
the
trial
court
and
the
proceeding
at
the
trial
court
ended
in
a
judgment
for
the
landlord.
we
presume
that
it
was
a
judgment
on
the
counterclaims
as
well.
in
this
respect,
evidence
tending
to
proof
of
the
counterclaims
was
submitted
at
the
trial
court.
it
wasn’t
admitted
into
evidence
because
of
the
lack
of
an
authenticating
witness.
but,
nevertheless,
the
proper
was
made
and
we
assumed
that
the
trial
judge
did
rule
on
the
counterclaims.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
thrust
of
the
opinion,
your
honor,
is
to
require
the
tenant
to
bring
his
affirmative
claims
in
a
separate
proceeding.
the
point
here
is,
though,
that
the
rule
of
the
court
permits
the
tenant
to
bring
it
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
is
put
a
condition
on
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right,
and
it
certainly
hasn’t
shown
any
predominant
state
interest
for
the
reason
to
put
this
condition
on
the
right.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no,
your
honor.
we’re
not
at
all
asking
that,
but
the
rule
seems
to
be
clear
that
the
tenant
could
assert
the
counterclaim
in
the
possessory
action.
if
the
counterclaim
is
one
which
arises,
one
which
would
be
tried
by
jury
in
1791,
then
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well
as
i
read
it,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
tenant
may
very
well
have
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
if
he
brings
his
affirmative
claims
in
a
subsequent
proceeding.
and,
we
assume
that
that
means
he
has
the
right
of
jury
trial
on
those
claims.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
rule
specifically
says
that
he
can
recover
a
money
judgment.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
i’ll
read
the
rule
to
you.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
say
that
the
tenant
couldn’t
bring
the
counterclaims
in
the
possessory
action.
it
only
said
that
when
he
does
bring
those
claims
in
the
possessory
action,
he
waives
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
those
claims.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
in
a
separate
proceeding.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
we
assume
that
he
could.
there’s
a
question
there
whether
or
not
there
would
be
some
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
the
possessory
action.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well,
it
may
be
court
cost,
your
honor,
but
the
problems
are,
in
terms
of
administration
of
justice,
are
quite
serious
because
here
we
have
two
trials
instead
of
one,
the
same
witnesses,
the
same
evidence,
the
issues
on
the
possessory
action
and
the
counterclaims
clearly
overlap.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
that
might
be
the
case,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
but
we’re
not
dealing
here
with
any
equitable
claims.
all
the
claims
here
are--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
your
honor?
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
rule
of
the
superior
court,
your
honor.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
read
the
rule
to
you.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
i’m
not
sure
where
it
is
in
the
brief
at
this
point,
your
honor.
it’s
quite
brief.
i
think
i
could
read
it.
the
rule
provides,
it’s
rule
5
(b)
of
the
landlord
and
tenant
rules
of
the
superior
court.
“in
actions
in
this
branch
for
recovery
of
possession
of
property
in
which
the
basis
of
recovery
is
non-payment
or
rent
or
in
which
there
is
joined
a
claim
for
recovery
of
rent
in
arrears,
the
defendant
may
assert
an
equitable
defense
of
recoupment
or
set
off
or
a
counterclaim
for
a
money
judgment
based
on
the
payment
of
rent
or
on
expenditures
claimed
as
credits
against
rent.
that’s
the
particular
portion
that’s
found
in
our
main
brief,
your
honor,
at
page
7,
quoted
in
part
of
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
our
main
brief
at
page
7,
your
honor.
it
is
quite
clear
at
this
date
that
the
seventh
amendment
applies
to
the
district
of
columbia
in
capital
traction
versus
hof
decided
in
1899
this
court
squarely
held
that
the
seventh
amendment
was
applicable
to
the
district.
the
question
then
is
the
standard
to
be
applied
under
the
seventh
amendment.
it
is
quite
clear
from
various
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
seventh
amendment
preserves
the
right
to
jury
trial
as
it
existed
in
england
in
1791
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
since
1830,
this
court,
in
parsons
v.
bedford
and
subsequently
and
most
recently
in
ross
v.
bernhard
in
1970,
stated
that
the
test
to
be
applied
to
determine
the
seventh
amendment
right
is
to
look
to
the
closest
historical
counterpart
of
common
law
and
determine
there
if
the
nature
of
the
issue
to
be
resolved
is
legal
and,
thus,
triable
by
jury.
in
other
words,
the
reference
must
be
to
the
right
asserted
and
the
remedy
sought,
and
then
to
the
actions
in
england
in
1791.
the
test
does
not
require
that
there’d
be
a
precise
counterpart.
this
was
clearly
pointed
out.
it
doesn’t
matter
if
the
statute
--
if
the
present
day
action
is
embodied
in
a
statute.
i
think
the
point
there
is
quite
obvious
that
much
of
the
common
law
has
undergone
an
evolution
and
if
any
precise
counterpart
were
required,
then
certainly
the
seventh
amendment
would
be
in
anachronism.
most
of
the
recent
cases
involving
the
seventh
amendment
such
as
beacon
theaters
versus
westover,
dairy
queen
v.
wood,
and
ross
v.
bernhard
have
arisen
as
a
result
of
the
merger
of
law
and
equity
by
way
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
problems
of
merger
are
not
involved
in
this
case
because
it’s
never
been
suggested
that
a
suit
for
possession,
such
as
the
present
one,
was
ever
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
equity.
it’s
quite
clear
that
actions
for
possessions
of
real
property
present,
perhaps,
the
classic
case
of
actions
tried
by
juries
at
common
law.
this
court,
in
whitehead
v.
shattuck
and
again
restated
in
ross
v.
bernhard,
indicated
that
action
seeking
to
recover
possession
of
real
property
are
unmistakably
legal
actions
and
jury
trial
would,
thus,
be
permitted.
at
common
law,
since
feudal
times,
there
were
several
actions
available
to
determine
the
right
to
possession.
each
had
to
do
with
particular
circumstances
of
the
case.
in
our
brief,
we
deal
with
the
three-principle
actions:
the
writ
of
assize
of
novel
disseisin,
the
writ
of
entry,
and
the
writ
of
ejectment.
these
most
closely
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
this
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no
issue
of
title
is
involved
in
this
case
so
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
merely
the
right
of
possession,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
point
here,
firstly
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
forcible
entry
and
detainer
which
you
speak
of,
your
honor,
is
not
precisely
the
same
thing
as
what
we
have
here.
what
forcible
entry
and
detainer
is,
today
in
the
united
states,
is
not
the
same
as
it
was
in
england
in
1791.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no
question,
your
honor,
but
our
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
that
is
our
point,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
and
our
point
is
that
in
england
in
1791,
which
was
the
critical
date
for
application
of
the
seventh
amendment
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
--
the
forcible
entry
and
detainer
actions
were
purely
criminal
actions.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
to
possession.
they
merely
punished
a
person
who
entered
by
force.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
they
certainly
were,
your
honor,
but
justice
of
the
peace--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no,
ejectment
was
tried
in
the
king’s
bench.
the
assize
entry
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
ejectment
at
first
of
all,
was
purely
to
try
possession.
and,
most
of
the
cases
which
talk
about
ejectment,
it’s
always
says
that
the
question
in
ejectment
is,
first,
the
right
to
possession,
then,
the
right
to
title.
title
became
--
the
reason
title
got
into
ejectment
is
because
the
early
title
actions
were
very
complicated.
the
courts
of
the
king’s
bench
made
it
quite
easy
for
parties
to
try
title
and
ejectment.
what
happened,
ejectment
became
the
one
form
of
action
to
try
possession
around
the
1700s.
during
this
period,
it
was
the
simplest
action
where
anyone
could
try
either
possession
or
title,
but
there’s
no
question,
but
in
1791
they
did
try
possession,
but
the
forcible
entry
and
detainer
actions
did
not
try
possession.
they
merely
restored
a
party
who
was
ousted
by
force
back
to
possession,
whether
or
not
he
had
a
right
to
possession.
and
then,
they
left
the
parties
to
go
their
own
way
through
the
civil
actions
to
determine
the
right
to
possession.
another
point,
your
honor,
the
justices
of
the
peace
in
england
in
1791
bear
no
correspondence
to
the
justices
of
the
peace
as
we
think
of
them
today
or
as
they
existed
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
early
1800s.
they
were
courts
of
record.
they
were
held
--
they
were
appointed
by
the
king.
they
held
grand
juries.
they
tried
all
cases
involving
felonies,
except
treason.
in
short,
they
were
just
the
correspondents
of
our
modern
criminal
courts.
there’s
no
question
that
a
right
to
jury
trial
applied
there,
and
we
presume
that
the
jury
trial
there
was
much
the
same
as
we
consider
it
today.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
we
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
it’s
possible,
your
honor,
it’s
concerned
about
the
question
of
12
men
versus
more
than
12
questions
of
challenges
to
juries.
it’s
our
understanding
from
what
the
authorities
say.
there
is
a
problem
here
that
there
isn’t
a
lot
of
information
available.
we’ve
attempted
to
research
all
the
authorities
and
the
most
that
we
could
find
is
that
there
was
a
jury
trial
and
there
were
a
jury
trial
in
the
sense
that
we
have
a
jury
trial
today.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
hof
was
the
fact
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
district
of
columbia
did
not
have
the
power
to
instruct
or
superintend
the
jury.
he
was
a
man
who
had
not
learned
at
law.
the
basis
of
the
decision
really
is
that
it
wasn’t
a
court
of
record.
what
hof
said,
essentially,
was
that
“well,
maybe
the
premise
should
be
laid”
and
between
1801
and
1864
the
justice
of
the
peace
court
in
the
district,
being
the
lowest
court,
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
eviction
proceedings.
they
had
jury
trials.
the
judge
did
not
instruct
them.
the
jury
merely
decided
the
issue
once
the
evidence
was
presented.
in
1899,
long
after
this
period
of
between
1801
and
1864,
the
court
looking
back
said
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
trials
were
not
common
law
jury
trials.
the
court
below
attempted
to
rely
on
that
as
a
break
in
the
history
of
the
right
to
jury
trial,
that
if
there
is
no
question
that
congress
didn’t
intend
that
these
be
jury
trials,
the
courts
in
the
district
had
always
thought
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
jury
trials
were
common
law
jury
trials.
today,
the
entire
problem
doesn’t
exist
since
we
have
available
a
court
which
can
give
a
constitutional
jury
trial.
the
point
that
we
have
made,
your
honor,
i
believe
is
the
fact
that
the
three
common
law
actions
which
we
cite:
assize,
entry,
and
ejectment
were
the
principal
actions
to
try
the
right
to
possession,
and
those
actions
were
prevailing
in
1791,
the
critical
date
for
the
seventh
amendment,
and
therefore,
today,
we
should
have
a
jury
trial
on
the
action
in
the
statutory
proceeding.
much
has
been
said
by
the
respondents
in
the
amicus
curiae
about
the
fact
that
the
proceeding
that
we
have
is
a
summary
proceeding.
the
argument
there
is
that
the
summary
proceeding
is
inconsistent
with
the
right
to
jury
trial.
they
rely
very
heavily
on
this
court’s
decision
in
lindsey
v.
normet.
in
lindsey,
it
was
held
that
the
state
of
oregon
did
not
violate
the
equal
protection
or
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
restricting
the
issues
which
could
be
raised
in
an
eviction
proceeding.
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia,
as
we
noted,
however,
permits
a
tenant
to
defend
a
suit
for
non-payment
on
the
basis
of
a
breach
of
warranty.
moreover,
it
also
permits
the
counterclaims
to
be
filed
in
the
same
proceeding.
it’s
not
a
summary
proceeding
in
the
sense
of
the
oregon
case.
but
even
notwithstanding
that,
oregon
itself
permits
such
a
jury
trial
in
a
far
more
summary
proceeding
than
we
have
here
in
the
district.
the
term
“summary”
only
applies
to
a
shortened
or
simplified
procedure
such
as
restricting
the
litigable
issues,
short
return
dates,
unnecessary
responsive
pleadings,
and
limited
discovery.
the
historians
generally
agree
that
assize
of
novel
disseisin
and
entry
were
equally
as
summary
as
the
present
day
eviction
statutes.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
point
is,
your
honor,
these
cases
go
very
quickly.
they’re
very
simple
cases
to
try
before
a
jury.
there’s
no
reason
why
a
jury
trial
can’t
be
granted
the
same
day
as
a
judge
trial.
it’s
merely
a
scheduling
problem.
we
have
six-men
juries
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well,
that
may
be
a
little
misleading,
your
honor,
the
number
of
cases.
it’s
obvious
that
the
landlord
and
tenant
court
handles
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases,
most
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
pardon?
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well,
it’s
hard
to
say
a
day,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
in
the
year
1971,
the
court
handled
the
122,000
cases.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no,
your
honor.
it’s
quite
clear
that
they
couldn’t.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
it
may
not,
your
honor.
it’s
a
misleading
question.
the
point
is
or
my
answer,
i’m
sorry,
the
122,000
figure
really
is
meaningless
because
97%
of
those
cases
are
ended
at
the
threshold.
they’re
either
default
judgments.
they’re
settled.
they’re
dismissed.
it’s
obvious
that
the
landlords
use
the
landlord
and
tenant
court
as
a
collection
agency,
and
the
question
is
the
payment
of
rent.
the
jury
trials
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
alright.
one
other
point
i
think
that
is
quite
important
is
the
practical
abilities
and
limitations
of
jurors
which
the
court
referred
to
in
ross
versus
bernhard.
the
court
noted
there
that
this
may
be
--
have
a
consideration
on
the
applicability
of
the
seventh
amendment
right.
the
present
action
presents
perhaps
the
best
example
of
a
case
suitable
for
a
jury
determination.
as
i
indicated,
the
issues
are
not
complex
or
technical.
they
merely
involve
the
question
of
habitability,
a
term
very
easily
comprehended
by
jurors.
they
can
apply
their
common
experience
and
their
common
sense
to
such
a
problem.
it’s
judged
in
terms
of
the
local
housing
code
which
requires
things
like
sanitary
and
safety
conditions,
adequate
heat
and
hot
water.
this
--
the
suitability
is
certainly
amplified
in
light
of
the
highly
complex
commercial
disputes
which
are
routinely
submitted
to
juries
in
any
trust
matters
or
trademark
infringements,
and
the
like.
also,
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
social
consequences
of
an
eviction
are
very
serious,
perhaps
the
harshest
of
any
civil
remedy.
it
results
in
eviction
of
the
tenant.
his
family
is
thrown
in
the
street.
certainly,
this
may
be
equally
severe
to
a
criminal
conviction,
and
the
use
of
a
jury
is
certainly
appropriate
in
such
a
proceeding.
some
of
these
are
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
i’m
not
quite
sure,
your
honor,
because
the
statute
itself
was
repealed.
it’s
clear
that
congress
didn’t
intend
to
repeal
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
congress
thought
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
there’s
no
question,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well,
that’s
what
they
said,
your
honor.
they
specifically
stated
that
we
consider
it
superfluous
in
light
of
the
constitutional
right.
i
think
another
important
point
is
that,
irrespective
of
the
possessory
action,
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
on
our
counterclaims
as
the
results
of
the
beacon
and
dairy
queen
doctrine.
as
i
indicated,
the
issues
overlap.
there
may
be
serious
questions
of
collateral
estoppel
and
the
like.
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
thank
you,
your
honors.
just
briefly,
i’d
like
to
reply
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
had
asked
earlier
regarding
the
12
men
good
and
true
and
the
juries
which
existed
in
common
law.
i
think
that
i
failed
to
indicate
the
fact
that
this
court
has
certainly
recognized
the
fact
that
the
jury
system
has
been
evolving
for
centuries.
the
point
being
that
the
seventh
amendment
doesn’t
protect
the
procedural
incidence
of
a
jury
trial.
it
merely
protects
the
substance.
and,
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
substance
of
jury
trial
in
1791
was
quite
the
same
as
it
is
today.
as
we
have
traced
the
history,
perhaps
maybe
too
far,
back
to
the
11th
--
12th
century,
of
course
we
have
to
realize
the
juries
were
undergoing
change
during
that
time
and
this
is
when
juries
were
first
being
formulated.
mr.
miller’s
argument
appears
to
be
directed
at
what
occurred
after
1791,
the
hof
case
and
most
of
the
problems
there.
anything
occurring
after
1791
appears
to
be
irrelevant
for
the
jury
determination.
the
ross
test
seems
to
be
clear
that
we
have
to
look
to
the
common
law
of
england
in
1791.
in
hof,
i
think
it’s
important
to
show
that
the
mistake
that
was
made
that
the
courts
and
everyone
in
the
district
of
columbia
thought
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
jury
trials
were
common
law
jury
trials,
they
tried
debt
actions
over
$20.
they’re
jurisdiction
--
they’re
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
up
to
$50,
i
believe,
at
some
point
during
that
time.
mr.
miller
has
also
indicated
that
the
--
for
some
reason,
the
tenants
are
going
to
file
counterclaims
and
the
122,000
cases,
this
is
really
unrealistic.
it’s
quite
clear
that
jury
trials
are
not
demanded
except
in
the
very
few
cases.
as
he
indicated
himself,
only
eight
trials
occurred
in
1971,
eight
jury
trials.
i
think
17cases
went
to
jury
and
9
settled
before
the
jury
rendered
a
verdict.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
well,
of
course
he
characterizes
this
as
a
dilatory
purpose.
it’s
quite
obvious
that
landlord-tenant
cases,
like
any
other
case
where
jury
demands
are
filed,
that
most
cases
settle
the
trial
problems:
attorneys
not
having
time
to
go
to
trial,
this
type
of
problem,
and
the
parties
just
wanting
to
settle.
these
cases
settle
much
easier
than
a
normal
civil
action.
the
question
of
dilatoriness
is
certainly
mr.
miller’s
characterization.
in
fact,
the
landlord
is
quiet
adequately
protected
in
these
proceedings
because
of
this
protective
procedure
which
judge
wright
set
out
in
the
javins
decision
and
later
amplified
in
another
case,
bell
versus
tsintolas
realty.
that
procedure
permits
the
landlord
or
requires
the
tenant
to
put
into
the
registry
of
the
court
the
pending
rent
during
the
--
the
rent
pending
the
proceeding
until
the
trial
date
comes
up.
certainly,
what
the
landlord
is
seeking
in
these
cases
is
the
rent
and,
of
course,
as
long
as
he’s
protected,
the
court
has
held
of
the
money
in
an
escrow
account
which
it
can
disperse
at
the
end
of
the
case,
he’s
fully
protected.
so
it’s
certain
now
that
the
backlog
doesn’t
affect
the
landlord,
if
there
is
a
backlog
at
all.
in
1971,
the
chief
judge
of
the
superior
court
issued
a
ruling
whereby
jury
trials
in
landlord
and
tenant
cases
were
to
take
place
three
weeks
after
the
return
date,
within
three
weeks
after
the
return
date.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
judgment
would
be
rendered
for
the
landlord.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
indicated
the
chief
judge
had
imposed
a
three-week
limit
on
jury
trials.
this
is
at
the
time
when
the
question
was
in
dispute
before
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
in
practice
today,
judge
trials
in
the
landlord
and
tenant
court
are
backlogged
anywhere
from
four
to
six
weeks.
so
the
delay
argument,
the
dilatoriness,
i
think,
really
means
nothing.
finally,
i’d
like
to
conclude,
your
honor,
just
by
noting
the
historical
linage
in
this
case
being
so
clear.
mr.
miller
certainly
hasn’t
shown
us
anything
that
takes
away
from
that
and
the
court
has,
on
numerous
occasions,
indicated
that
all
possible
doubts
regarding
the
seventh
amendment
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
a
jury
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
present
case
comes
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
and
it
presents
the
question
of
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
an
action
brought
by
a
landlord
to
recover
possession
of
real
property
pursuant
to
the
district
of
columbia
statutory
eviction
proceeding
and,
also
it
raises
the
question
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
tenant’s
counter
claims
for
money
damages
brought
in
that
same
proceeding.
briefly
stated,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows.
in
august
of
1971,
the
respondent
landlord
sued
the
petitioner
for
possession
of
premises
held
under
a
lease
alleging
non-payment
of
rent
for
a
three-month
period.
on
the
answer
day,
the
tenant
filed
an
answer
denying
that
any
rent
was
owed
because
of
the
failure
of
the
landlord
to
maintain
the
premises
in
compliance
with
the
district
of
columbia
housing
regulations.
the
case
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
administrative
regulations
there
permit
a
tenant
to
raise
this
defense
at
a
possessory
action.
the
tenant
also
filed
affirmative
claims
seeking
a
money
judgment
for
expenses
incurred
by
him
to
repair
the
premises
and
for
return
of
rent
paid
while
the
landlord
was
in
breach
of
his
warranty.
the
applicable
rules
of
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
permit
the
tenant
to
raise
these
affirmative
defenses.
at
the
same
time,
on
the
answer
day,
the
tenant
demanded
a
trial
by
jury,
paid
the
requisite
fees,
and
complied
with
all
necessary
requirements
for
demand
of
jury
trial.
the
trial
judge
struck
the
jury
demand
over
the
objection
of
the
tenant
that
he
was
constitutionally
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury.
the
case
was
subsequently
tried
by
the
court
and
the
judgment
for
possession
was
rendered
for
the
landlord.
on
appeal,
the
court
below
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
holding
that
congress,
in
1970,
had
repealed
the
statutory
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
these
eviction
proceedings
and
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
seventh
amendment
in
such
proceedings.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
i
would
think
that
they
did,
your
honor.
the
trial
court
and
the
proceeding
at
the
trial
court
ended
in
a
judgment
for
the
landlord.
we
presume
that
it
was
a
judgment
on
the
counterclaims
as
well.
in
this
respect,
evidence
tending
to
proof
of
the
counterclaims
was
submitted
at
the
trial
court.
it
wasn’t
admitted
into
evidence
because
of
the
lack
of
an
authenticating
witness.
but,
nevertheless,
the
proper
was
made
and
we
assumed
that
the
trial
judge
did
rule
on
the
counterclaims.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
thrust
of
the
opinion,
your
honor,
is
to
require
the
tenant
to
bring
his
affirmative
claims
in
a
separate
proceeding.
the
point
here
is,
though,
that
the
rule
of
the
court
permits
the
tenant
to
bring
it
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
is
put
a
condition
on
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right,
and
it
certainly
hasn’t
shown
any
predominant
state
interest
for
the
reason
to
put
this
condition
on
the
right.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no,
your
honor.
we’re
not
at
all
asking
that,
but
the
rule
seems
to
be
clear
that
the
tenant
could
assert
the
counterclaim
in
the
possessory
action.
if
the
counterclaim
is
one
which
arises,
one
which
would
be
tried
by
jury
in
1791,
then
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well
as
i
read
it,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
tenant
may
very
well
have
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
if
he
brings
his
affirmative
claims
in
a
subsequent
proceeding.
and,
we
assume
that
that
means
he
has
the
right
of
jury
trial
on
those
claims.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
rule
specifically
says
that
he
can
recover
a
money
judgment.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
i’ll
read
the
rule
to
you.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
say
that
the
tenant
couldn’t
bring
the
counterclaims
in
the
possessory
action.
it
only
said
that
when
he
does
bring
those
claims
in
the
possessory
action,
he
waives
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
those
claims.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
in
a
separate
proceeding.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
we
assume
that
he
could.
there’s
a
question
there
whether
or
not
there
would
be
some
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
the
possessory
action.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well,
it
may
be
court
cost,
your
honor,
but
the
problems
are,
in
terms
of
administration
of
justice,
are
quite
serious
because
here
we
have
two
trials
instead
of
one,
the
same
witnesses,
the
same
evidence,
the
issues
on
the
possessory
action
and
the
counterclaims
clearly
overlap.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
that
might
be
the
case,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
but
we’re
not
dealing
here
with
any
equitable
claims.
all
the
claims
here
are--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
your
honor?
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
rule
of
the
superior
court,
your
honor.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
read
the
rule
to
you.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
i’m
not
sure
where
it
is
in
the
brief
at
this
point,
your
honor.
it’s
quite
brief.
i
think
i
could
read
it.
the
rule
provides,
it’s
rule
5
(b)
of
the
landlord
and
tenant
rules
of
the
superior
court.
“in
actions
in
this
branch
for
recovery
of
possession
of
property
in
which
the
basis
of
recovery
is
non-payment
or
rent
or
in
which
there
is
joined
a
claim
for
recovery
of
rent
in
arrears,
the
defendant
may
assert
an
equitable
defense
of
recoupment
or
set
off
or
a
counterclaim
for
a
money
judgment
based
on
the
payment
of
rent
or
on
expenditures
claimed
as
credits
against
rent.
that’s
the
particular
portion
that’s
found
in
our
main
brief,
your
honor,
at
page
7,
quoted
in
part
of
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
our
main
brief
at
page
7,
your
honor.
it
is
quite
clear
at
this
date
that
the
seventh
amendment
applies
to
the
district
of
columbia
in
capital
traction
versus
hof
decided
in
1899
this
court
squarely
held
that
the
seventh
amendment
was
applicable
to
the
district.
the
question
then
is
the
standard
to
be
applied
under
the
seventh
amendment.
it
is
quite
clear
from
various
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
seventh
amendment
preserves
the
right
to
jury
trial
as
it
existed
in
england
in
1791
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
since
1830,
this
court,
in
parsons
v.
bedford
and
subsequently
and
most
recently
in
ross
v.
bernhard
in
1970,
stated
that
the
test
to
be
applied
to
determine
the
seventh
amendment
right
is
to
look
to
the
closest
historical
counterpart
of
common
law
and
determine
there
if
the
nature
of
the
issue
to
be
resolved
is
legal
and,
thus,
triable
by
jury.
in
other
words,
the
reference
must
be
to
the
right
asserted
and
the
remedy
sought,
and
then
to
the
actions
in
england
in
1791.
the
test
does
not
require
that
there’d
be
a
precise
counterpart.
this
was
clearly
pointed
out.
it
doesn’t
matter
if
the
statute
--
if
the
present
day
action
is
embodied
in
a
statute.
i
think
the
point
there
is
quite
obvious
that
much
of
the
common
law
has
undergone
an
evolution
and
if
any
precise
counterpart
were
required,
then
certainly
the
seventh
amendment
would
be
in
anachronism.
most
of
the
recent
cases
involving
the
seventh
amendment
such
as
beacon
theaters
versus
westover,
dairy
queen
v.
wood,
and
ross
v.
bernhard
have
arisen
as
a
result
of
the
merger
of
law
and
equity
by
way
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
problems
of
merger
are
not
involved
in
this
case
because
it’s
never
been
suggested
that
a
suit
for
possession,
such
as
the
present
one,
was
ever
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
equity.
it’s
quite
clear
that
actions
for
possessions
of
real
property
present,
perhaps,
the
classic
case
of
actions
tried
by
juries
at
common
law.
this
court,
in
whitehead
v.
shattuck
and
again
restated
in
ross
v.
bernhard,
indicated
that
action
seeking
to
recover
possession
of
real
property
are
unmistakably
legal
actions
and
jury
trial
would,
thus,
be
permitted.
at
common
law,
since
feudal
times,
there
were
several
actions
available
to
determine
the
right
to
possession.
each
had
to
do
with
particular
circumstances
of
the
case.
in
our
brief,
we
deal
with
the
three-principle
actions:
the
writ
of
assize
of
novel
disseisin,
the
writ
of
entry,
and
the
writ
of
ejectment.
these
most
closely
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
this
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no
issue
of
title
is
involved
in
this
case
so
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
merely
the
right
of
possession,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
point
here,
firstly
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
forcible
entry
and
detainer
which
you
speak
of,
your
honor,
is
not
precisely
the
same
thing
as
what
we
have
here.
what
forcible
entry
and
detainer
is,
today
in
the
united
states,
is
not
the
same
as
it
was
in
england
in
1791.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no
question,
your
honor,
but
our
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
that
is
our
point,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
and
our
point
is
that
in
england
in
1791,
which
was
the
critical
date
for
application
of
the
seventh
amendment
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
--
the
forcible
entry
and
detainer
actions
were
purely
criminal
actions.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
to
possession.
they
merely
punished
a
person
who
entered
by
force.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
they
certainly
were,
your
honor,
but
justice
of
the
peace--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no,
ejectment
was
tried
in
the
king’s
bench.
the
assize
entry
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
ejectment
at
first
of
all,
was
purely
to
try
possession.
and,
most
of
the
cases
which
talk
about
ejectment,
it’s
always
says
that
the
question
in
ejectment
is,
first,
the
right
to
possession,
then,
the
right
to
title.
title
became
--
the
reason
title
got
into
ejectment
is
because
the
early
title
actions
were
very
complicated.
the
courts
of
the
king’s
bench
made
it
quite
easy
for
parties
to
try
title
and
ejectment.
what
happened,
ejectment
became
the
one
form
of
action
to
try
possession
around
the
1700s.
during
this
period,
it
was
the
simplest
action
where
anyone
could
try
either
possession
or
title,
but
there’s
no
question,
but
in
1791
they
did
try
possession,
but
the
forcible
entry
and
detainer
actions
did
not
try
possession.
they
merely
restored
a
party
who
was
ousted
by
force
back
to
possession,
whether
or
not
he
had
a
right
to
possession.
and
then,
they
left
the
parties
to
go
their
own
way
through
the
civil
actions
to
determine
the
right
to
possession.
another
point,
your
honor,
the
justices
of
the
peace
in
england
in
1791
bear
no
correspondence
to
the
justices
of
the
peace
as
we
think
of
them
today
or
as
they
existed
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
early
1800s.
they
were
courts
of
record.
they
were
held
--
they
were
appointed
by
the
king.
they
held
grand
juries.
they
tried
all
cases
involving
felonies,
except
treason.
in
short,
they
were
just
the
correspondents
of
our
modern
criminal
courts.
there’s
no
question
that
a
right
to
jury
trial
applied
there,
and
we
presume
that
the
jury
trial
there
was
much
the
same
as
we
consider
it
today.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
we
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
it’s
possible,
your
honor,
it’s
concerned
about
the
question
of
12
men
versus
more
than
12
questions
of
challenges
to
juries.
it’s
our
understanding
from
what
the
authorities
say.
there
is
a
problem
here
that
there
isn’t
a
lot
of
information
available.
we’ve
attempted
to
research
all
the
authorities
and
the
most
that
we
could
find
is
that
there
was
a
jury
trial
and
there
were
a
jury
trial
in
the
sense
that
we
have
a
jury
trial
today.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
hof
was
the
fact
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
district
of
columbia
did
not
have
the
power
to
instruct
or
superintend
the
jury.
he
was
a
man
who
had
not
learned
at
law.
the
basis
of
the
decision
really
is
that
it
wasn’t
a
court
of
record.
what
hof
said,
essentially,
was
that
“well,
maybe
the
premise
should
be
laid”
and
between
1801
and
1864
the
justice
of
the
peace
court
in
the
district,
being
the
lowest
court,
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
eviction
proceedings.
they
had
jury
trials.
the
judge
did
not
instruct
them.
the
jury
merely
decided
the
issue
once
the
evidence
was
presented.
in
1899,
long
after
this
period
of
between
1801
and
1864,
the
court
looking
back
said
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
trials
were
not
common
law
jury
trials.
the
court
below
attempted
to
rely
on
that
as
a
break
in
the
history
of
the
right
to
jury
trial,
that
if
there
is
no
question
that
congress
didn’t
intend
that
these
be
jury
trials,
the
courts
in
the
district
had
always
thought
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
jury
trials
were
common
law
jury
trials.
today,
the
entire
problem
doesn’t
exist
since
we
have
available
a
court
which
can
give
a
constitutional
jury
trial.
the
point
that
we
have
made,
your
honor,
i
believe
is
the
fact
that
the
three
common
law
actions
which
we
cite:
assize,
entry,
and
ejectment
were
the
principal
actions
to
try
the
right
to
possession,
and
those
actions
were
prevailing
in
1791,
the
critical
date
for
the
seventh
amendment,
and
therefore,
today,
we
should
have
a
jury
trial
on
the
action
in
the
statutory
proceeding.
much
has
been
said
by
the
respondents
in
the
amicus
curiae
about
the
fact
that
the
proceeding
that
we
have
is
a
summary
proceeding.
the
argument
there
is
that
the
summary
proceeding
is
inconsistent
with
the
right
to
jury
trial.
they
rely
very
heavily
on
this
court’s
decision
in
lindsey
v.
normet.
in
lindsey,
it
was
held
that
the
state
of
oregon
did
not
violate
the
equal
protection
or
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
restricting
the
issues
which
could
be
raised
in
an
eviction
proceeding.
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia,
as
we
noted,
however,
permits
a
tenant
to
defend
a
suit
for
non-payment
on
the
basis
of
a
breach
of
warranty.
moreover,
it
also
permits
the
counterclaims
to
be
filed
in
the
same
proceeding.
it’s
not
a
summary
proceeding
in
the
sense
of
the
oregon
case.
but
even
notwithstanding
that,
oregon
itself
permits
such
a
jury
trial
in
a
far
more
summary
proceeding
than
we
have
here
in
the
district.
the
term
“summary”
only
applies
to
a
shortened
or
simplified
procedure
such
as
restricting
the
litigable
issues,
short
return
dates,
unnecessary
responsive
pleadings,
and
limited
discovery.
the
historians
generally
agree
that
assize
of
novel
disseisin
and
entry
were
equally
as
summary
as
the
present
day
eviction
statutes.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
the
point
is,
your
honor,
these
cases
go
very
quickly.
they’re
very
simple
cases
to
try
before
a
jury.
there’s
no
reason
why
a
jury
trial
can’t
be
granted
the
same
day
as
a
judge
trial.
it’s
merely
a
scheduling
problem.
we
have
six-men
juries
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well,
that
may
be
a
little
misleading,
your
honor,
the
number
of
cases.
it’s
obvious
that
the
landlord
and
tenant
court
handles
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases,
most
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
pardon?
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well,
it’s
hard
to
say
a
day,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
in
the
year
1971,
the
court
handled
the
122,000
cases.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
no,
your
honor.
it’s
quite
clear
that
they
couldn’t.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
it
may
not,
your
honor.
it’s
a
misleading
question.
the
point
is
or
my
answer,
i’m
sorry,
the
122,000
figure
really
is
meaningless
because
97%
of
those
cases
are
ended
at
the
threshold.
they’re
either
default
judgments.
they’re
settled.
they’re
dismissed.
it’s
obvious
that
the
landlords
use
the
landlord
and
tenant
court
as
a
collection
agency,
and
the
question
is
the
payment
of
rent.
the
jury
trials
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
alright.
one
other
point
i
think
that
is
quite
important
is
the
practical
abilities
and
limitations
of
jurors
which
the
court
referred
to
in
ross
versus
bernhard.
the
court
noted
there
that
this
may
be
--
have
a
consideration
on
the
applicability
of
the
seventh
amendment
right.
the
present
action
presents
perhaps
the
best
example
of
a
case
suitable
for
a
jury
determination.
as
i
indicated,
the
issues
are
not
complex
or
technical.
they
merely
involve
the
question
of
habitability,
a
term
very
easily
comprehended
by
jurors.
they
can
apply
their
common
experience
and
their
common
sense
to
such
a
problem.
it’s
judged
in
terms
of
the
local
housing
code
which
requires
things
like
sanitary
and
safety
conditions,
adequate
heat
and
hot
water.
this
--
the
suitability
is
certainly
amplified
in
light
of
the
highly
complex
commercial
disputes
which
are
routinely
submitted
to
juries
in
any
trust
matters
or
trademark
infringements,
and
the
like.
also,
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
social
consequences
of
an
eviction
are
very
serious,
perhaps
the
harshest
of
any
civil
remedy.
it
results
in
eviction
of
the
tenant.
his
family
is
thrown
in
the
street.
certainly,
this
may
be
equally
severe
to
a
criminal
conviction,
and
the
use
of
a
jury
is
certainly
appropriate
in
such
a
proceeding.
some
of
these
are
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
i’m
not
quite
sure,
your
honor,
because
the
statute
itself
was
repealed.
it’s
clear
that
congress
didn’t
intend
to
repeal
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
congress
thought
--
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
there’s
no
question,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
well,
that’s
what
they
said,
your
honor.
they
specifically
stated
that
we
consider
it
superfluous
in
light
of
the
constitutional
right.
i
think
another
important
point
is
that,
irrespective
of
the
possessory
action,
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
on
our
counterclaims
as
the
results
of
the
beacon
and
dairy
queen
doctrine.
as
i
indicated,
the
issues
overlap.
there
may
be
serious
questions
of
collateral
estoppel
and
the
like.
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
thank
you,
your
honors.
just
briefly,
i’d
like
to
reply
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
had
asked
earlier
regarding
the
12
men
good
and
true
and
the
juries
which
existed
in
common
law.
i
think
that
i
failed
to
indicate
the
fact
that
this
court
has
certainly
recognized
the
fact
that
the
jury
system
has
been
evolving
for
centuries.
the
point
being
that
the
seventh
amendment
doesn’t
protect
the
procedural
incidence
of
a
jury
trial.
it
merely
protects
the
substance.
and,
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
substance
of
jury
trial
in
1791
was
quite
the
same
as
it
is
today.
as
we
have
traced
the
history,
perhaps
maybe
too
far,
back
to
the
11th
--
12th
century,
of
course
we
have
to
realize
the
juries
were
undergoing
change
during
that
time
and
this
is
when
juries
were
first
being
formulated.
mr.
miller’s
argument
appears
to
be
directed
at
what
occurred
after
1791,
the
hof
case
and
most
of
the
problems
there.
anything
occurring
after
1791
appears
to
be
irrelevant
for
the
jury
determination.
the
ross
test
seems
to
be
clear
that
we
have
to
look
to
the
common
law
of
england
in
1791.
in
hof,
i
think
it’s
important
to
show
that
the
mistake
that
was
made
that
the
courts
and
everyone
in
the
district
of
columbia
thought
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
jury
trials
were
common
law
jury
trials,
they
tried
debt
actions
over
$20.
they’re
jurisdiction
--
they’re
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
up
to
$50,
i
believe,
at
some
point
during
that
time.
mr.
miller
has
also
indicated
that
the
--
for
some
reason,
the
tenants
are
going
to
file
counterclaims
and
the
122,000
cases,
this
is
really
unrealistic.
it’s
quite
clear
that
jury
trials
are
not
demanded
except
in
the
very
few
cases.
as
he
indicated
himself,
only
eight
trials
occurred
in
1971,
eight
jury
trials.
i
think
17cases
went
to
jury
and
9
settled
before
the
jury
rendered
a
verdict.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
well,
of
course
he
characterizes
this
as
a
dilatory
purpose.
it’s
quite
obvious
that
landlord-tenant
cases,
like
any
other
case
where
jury
demands
are
filed,
that
most
cases
settle
the
trial
problems:
attorneys
not
having
time
to
go
to
trial,
this
type
of
problem,
and
the
parties
just
wanting
to
settle.
these
cases
settle
much
easier
than
a
normal
civil
action.
the
question
of
dilatoriness
is
certainly
mr.
miller’s
characterization.
in
fact,
the
landlord
is
quiet
adequately
protected
in
these
proceedings
because
of
this
protective
procedure
which
judge
wright
set
out
in
the
javins
decision
and
later
amplified
in
another
case,
bell
versus
tsintolas
realty.
that
procedure
permits
the
landlord
or
requires
the
tenant
to
put
into
the
registry
of
the
court
the
pending
rent
during
the
--
the
rent
pending
the
proceeding
until
the
trial
date
comes
up.
certainly,
what
the
landlord
is
seeking
in
these
cases
is
the
rent
and,
of
course,
as
long
as
he’s
protected,
the
court
has
held
of
the
money
in
an
escrow
account
which
it
can
disperse
at
the
end
of
the
case,
he’s
fully
protected.
so
it’s
certain
now
that
the
backlog
doesn’t
affect
the
landlord,
if
there
is
a
backlog
at
all.
in
1971,
the
chief
judge
of
the
superior
court
issued
a
ruling
whereby
jury
trials
in
landlord
and
tenant
cases
were
to
take
place
three
weeks
after
the
return
date,
within
three
weeks
after
the
return
date.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
judgment
would
be
rendered
for
the
landlord.
mr.
norman
c.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
indicated
the
chief
judge
had
imposed
a
three-week
limit
on
jury
trials.
this
is
at
the
time
when
the
question
was
in
dispute
before
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
in
practice
today,
judge
trials
in
the
landlord
and
tenant
court
are
backlogged
anywhere
from
four
to
six
weeks.
so
the
delay
argument,
the
dilatoriness,
i
think,
really
means
nothing.
finally,
i’d
like
to
conclude,
your
honor,
just
by
noting
the
historical
linage
in
this
case
being
so
clear.
mr.
miller
certainly
hasn’t
shown
us
anything
that
takes
away
from
that
and
the
court
has,
on
numerous
occasions,
indicated
that
all
possible
doubts
regarding
the
seventh
amendment
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
a
jury
trial.
thank
you.
