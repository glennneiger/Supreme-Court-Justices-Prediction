justice
potter
stewart
did
the
trial
court
deal
with
the
tenant’s
counterclaims?
justice
potter
stewart
and
had
ruled
against
the
tenant?
justice
potter
stewart
ejectment,
as
i
understand
it
or
as
i
remember
it
from
law
school,
was
an
action
that
tried
title
and
forcible
entry
and
detainer
was
an
action
to
try
the
right
of
possession.
this
is
the
latter,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
no
issue
of
title
is
involved
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
purely
the
issue
of
the
right
of
possession,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
remember
that,
that
was
tried
at
common
law
by
a
justices
of
the
peace
with
12
good
men
and
true,
but
who
were
not
considered
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
common
law
seventh
amendment
jury,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i’m
going
pretty
far
back.
i
don’t
have
any
practice
in
this.
i
haven’t
thought
about
it
in
a
long
time.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
--
but
the
point
is
--
your
point
is,
isn’t
it,
that
whether
or
not
the
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
is
applicable
depends
upon
the
historical
roots
of
what
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
district
action
is.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
were
the
justice
of
the
peace’s
actions?
justice
potter
stewart
not
king’s
bench
actions?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
ejectment
is
to
try
title,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
you
do
say
that
that
justice
of
the
peace,
12
men
and
true
was
the
equivalent
of
a
common
law
seventh
amendment
jury,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
i’d
learned
otherwise
in
law
school.
maybe
i
was
mis-taught.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
that’s
the
hof
case?
justice
potter
stewart
held
--
a
decision
by
this
court
held
that
a
jury
before
the
criminal
justice
of
the
peace
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
not
a
seventh
amendment
jury,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
suppose
that
even
if
you
shouldn’t
prevail
upon
your
historic
argument,
your
basic
constitutional
argument,
that
you
could
still
make
an
argument
that
congress
intended
--
congress
intended
that
there’d
be
a
jury
trial
and
there
is,
therefore,
an
implicit
statutory
right
to
a
jury
trial
here
whatever
the
constitution
or
common
law
right
may
or
may
have
not
been?
in
other
words
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
i
understand
it,
there
always
was
a
statutory
right
until
1970.
and
in
1970,
the
reorganization
of
the
courts
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
that
language
was
omitted,
but
that
the
clear
legislative
history
shows
that
the
reason
it
was
omitted
is
that
congress
thought
it
wasn’t
necessary
that
it
was,
to
use
the
words
of
the
committee
report,
superfluous.
and,
don’t
you
think
you
could
make
an
argument
that
there’s
a
statutory
right
to
a
jury
regardless
of
whether
you’re
right
or
wrong
on
your
historic
and
constitutional
analysis?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it’s
very
clear
that
congress,
is
it
not
or
am
i
mistaken
that
congress
thought
it
was
unnecessary
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that
congress
intended
to
give
a
statute
--
right
to
a
jury.
