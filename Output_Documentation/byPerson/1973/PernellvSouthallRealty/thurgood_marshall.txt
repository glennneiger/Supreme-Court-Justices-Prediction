justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
rule
say
you
can
recover
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
money
judgment
in
that
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
you
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
its
interpretation
of
its
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
he
file
another
claim
for
the
damages
with
a
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
a
separate
proceeding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
on
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
you
could
sue
and
you
could
recover?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
means
the
difference
is
filed
in
another
lawsuit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
means
$30.
that’s
how
it
is,
isn’t
it,
the
court
cost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don’t
you
have
some
actions
in
equity
where
you
can’t
recover
damages
and
if
you
want
damages,
you
have
to
go
over
the
laws
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
might
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you’re
dealing
with
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’re
dealing
with
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
me
any
other
case
with
--
on
a
jury
trial,
it’s
a
summary
trial
today
where
you
take
three
weeks
to
pick
a
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
cases
does
the
landlord
and
tenant
court
handle
in
a
day
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
hundreds
a
day
--
hundreds
a
day.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
they
do
that
in
many
cases
with
juries?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that’s
the
difference
between
summary
and
a
jury
trial,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
think
you
need
to
spend
that
much
time
with
the
word
“summary”
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
seventh
amendment
guarantees
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
in
civil
actions
brought
in
district
of
columbia
for
the
recovery
of
possession
of
real
properties.
few
months
after
renting
petitioner
house,
respondent
sought
to
evict
him
for
non-payment
of
his
rent.
petitioner
reclaimed
he
was
entitled
to
withhold
the
rent
because
the
premises
were
not
in
compliance
with
certain
district
of
columbia
housing
regulations.
he
also
claimed
that
respondent
had
agreed
to
waive
several
months
rent
return
for
repairs.
petitioner
requested
a
jury
trial
to
resolve
the
factual
questions
raised
by
these
pleadings.
the
trail
judge
however
refused
the
jury
trial
and
entered
judgment
against
petitioner
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
holding
that
a
jury
trial
was
not
constitutionally
required.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
find
that
examining
a
great
deal
of
historical
materials
and
conclude
that
the
right
to
recover
possession
of
real
property
was
a
right
as
obtained
and
protected
by
the
courts
of
the
common
law
at
the
time
the
seventh
amendment
was
adopted.
in
all
of
the
causes
of
action
developed
in
common
law
for
the
recovery
of
real
property,
the
parties
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
we,
therefore
hold
that
petitioner
was
entitled
under
the
seventh
amendment
to
a
jury
trial
in
this
eviction
suit.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceeding
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
douglas
concurred
in
the
result.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
rule
say
you
can
recover
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
money
judgment
in
that
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
you
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
its
interpretation
of
its

justice
thurgood

well,
could
he
file
