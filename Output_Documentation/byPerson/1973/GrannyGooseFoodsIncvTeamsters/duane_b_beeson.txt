mr.
duane
b.
beeson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
union
was
found
to
have
violated
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
case
more
than
six
months
after
it
had
been
issued
without
hearing,
and
was
adjudicated
guilty
of
criminal
contempt.
the
basis
upon
which
the
petitioners
seek
to
sustain
that
finding
which
was
over
turned
by
the
court
below,
is
that
section
1450
of
title
28
converted
the
temporary
retraining
order
of
the
state
which
is
i
say
was
issued
without
a
hearing
into
an
order
of
unlimited
duration
so
that
it
continued
on
in
perpetuity
until
such
time
as
the
federal
court
might
act
on
it.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
that
is
what
he
said
and
essentially,
that
is
quite
happened.
there
was
a
telephone
notice
given
which
is
a
matter
of
common
practice
in
this
jurisdiction.
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
union
did
appear
at
the
time
that
the
original
restraining
order
was
issued.
it
was
no
hearing
in
the
ordinary
sense.
the
attorney
under
those
circumstances
has
handed
the
papers
two
or
three
minutes
before
a
corporate
takes
place
with
the
judge
and
such
arguments
as
can
be
put
together
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
or
maybe
made.
i
was
not
the
attorney
who
was
present
on
that
occasion
but
i
think
that
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
practice
to
represent
that
this
is
the
way
that
it
works
out.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that
they
will
be
and
i
think
that
is
particularly
true
in
labor
dispute
cases.
there
was
no
hearing
in
the
sense
that
i
think
you
had
just
use
the
phrase
however
that
is
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
papers,
collect
evidence,
talk
with
the
clients
and
witnesses
and
so
forth
and
bring
forth
some
kind
of
considerations
which
will
support
the
respondent’s
position.
and
either
by
way
of
affidavits
or
oral
testimony,
there
was
nothing
of
that
kind.
this
is
an
informal
courtesy
type
of
proceeding
which
has
developed
in
the
bar
of
the
san
francisco
bay
area
in
state
of
california.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
i
would
say
that
your
honor.
the
application
for
a
restraining
order
was
going
to
be
determined
within
a
manner
of
minutes
or
half
an
hour
or
whatever
time
it
took
just
to
talk
about
the
case
a
little
bit,
and
that’s
what
happened.
now,
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
your
honor,
that’s
just
another
way
of
saying
when
shall
the
case
be
set
down
for
return
on
the
return
date
for
the
year
in
the
order
to
show
cause
by
preliminary
injunction
not
be
issued.
and
either
the
judge
will
or
will
not
enter
a
temporary
restraining
order
pending
that
date
depending
on
how
he
feels
about
the
case.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
am
sure
there
was
in
the
sense
that
issuance
of
the
restraining
order
without
a
hearing
was
opposed
on
whatever
basis
the
attorney
for
the
union
could
come
up
with
on
that
short
notice.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
motion
to
dissolve,
your
honor.
that
was
simultaneous
with
the
petition
for
removals
so
that
the
motion
to
dissolve
is
filed
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
next
step
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
proceeding
of
this
kind
would
be
the
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction
on
the
part
of
the
moving
party
namely
they
person
seeking
it
and
that
would
be
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
not
that,
not
certain
with
any
certainty.
the
reason
that
i
hesitate,
mr.
justice,
is
that
conceivably
we
might
have
tried
to
appeal
from
the
ruling
on
motion
to
dissolve.
i
do
not
think
that,
that
would
have
been
in
an
appealable
order.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
case
seemed
to
be
difficult
to
align
your
honor.
in
this
field,
they
turn
on
the
ruined
facts.
a
general
rule
of
course
is
that
the
grant
or
denial
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
is
not
appealable.
the
grant
or
denial
or
preliminary
injunction
is
appealable.
now
it
is
of
course
true
that
the
particular
label
that
may
be
put
upon
the
order
is
not
determined
too.
and
there
are
cases
in
which
where
the
nature
of
the
motion,
the
kind
of
evidence
that
was
brought
forth
the
argument
that
was
heard
is
such
as
to
be
the
equivalent
of
the
raising
the
issues
that
would
be
raised
under
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
motion
to
dissolve
was
made
in
the
federal
court
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that
is
correct.
it
was
not
made
in
the
state
court.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
we
had
a
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
which
was
limited
to
the
norris-la
guardia
issue.
the
raising
as
we
did
at
that
time,
the
law
as
was
reflected
in
sinclair
against
atkinson.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
it
was
the
solid
ground
which
the
respondent
union
raised.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
you
can
file
a
motion
to
dissolve
in
the
federal
district
court
on
any
ground
that
you
think
will
ultimately
prevail
i
suppose.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
propriety
of
the
issues
of
its
injunction,
your
honor
turns
at
all
together
at
different
considerations
and
those
which
are
raised
in
the
motion
--on
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dissolve.
we
raised
the
narrow
jurisdictional
issue
as
to
whether
the
injunction
could
be
maintained
in
the
federal
district
court.
now
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
i
suspect
that
the
considerations
which
would
have
been
put
forth
would
be
those
which
deal
with
the
nature
of
the
dispute
whether
or
not
this
was
the
situation
which
could
or
should
be
arbitrated
whether
or
not
the
union
and
the
employers
were
party
to
the
contract
which
the
petitioners
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
doubt
it
if
it
would
have
been
appropriate
to
do
so.
the
answer
to
your
question
certainly
is
yes
in
the
theoretical
abstract
way,
mr.
justice
white.
but
the
ordinary
development
of
cases
like
this
is
to
raise
the
broader
equitable
issues
in
connection
with
the
hearing
upon
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
which
ordinarily
comes
on
the
return
date.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
oh!
we
don’t
need
to
go
that
far.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
our
position
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
oh!
yes,
as
far
as
the
--
yes,
at
the
time
that
we
made
the
motion.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
we
were
very
confident
that
time.
[laughter]
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
your
honor,
the
sequence
of
the
events
was
that
we
filed
the
petition
for
removal
and
the
motion
to
dissolve
on
may
19
and
it
was
heard
on
may
27.
boys
markets
came
down
on
june
1.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
and
the
court,
district
court
declined
to
rule
from
the
bench
after
hearing
our
arguments
on
the
sinclair,
having
been
advised
that
this
court
had
boys
markets
under
consideration
and
what
finger
in
the
air
to
see
which
[voice
overlap]
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes.
and
then
as
soon
as
boys
markets
came
down,
the
motion
to
dissolve
was
denied
and
only
on
the
ground
that
boys
markets
had
require
that
result
which,
mr.
justice
brennan
was
a
wrong
conclusion
and
we
have
develop
these
points
to
some
extent
in
our
brief.
this
is
not
a
boys
market’s
case.
but
we
never
had
an
opportunity
that
makes
from
the
motion
to
dissolve
to
discuss
those
matters
because
boys
markets
at
that
time
was
still
pending
and
we
were
relying
upon
sinclair.
the
central
issues
in
this
case,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
think
is
the
correct
interpretation
and
construction
to
be
given
section
1450
of
title
28.
now,
we
start
in
addressing
ourselves
to
that
question
what
i
think
is
a
firm
premise
and
that
is
the
state
court
order
did
have
an
expiration
date,
a
terminal
date,
a
maximum
duration
of
20
days
after
its
original
issuance.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
on
june
7.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
this
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit.
both
the
dissenting
judge
and
the
majority
agreed
with
the
fact
that
you
had
a
limited
duration,
a
maximum
duration
of
20
days
with
respect
to
that
state
court
order.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
statute
reads
that
the
return
date
upon
the
issuance
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
shall
be
no
later
than
15
days
after
its
issuance
or
for
good
cause
showing
20
days.
now
the
court
below
felt
that
it
was
a
realistic
view
approach
to
assume
that
the
20-day
period
probably
would
have
been
used
up
and
proceedings
before
the
state
court
if
the
case
had
remained
there.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
good
sense
to
this
point
of
view
in
that
by
allowing
them
maximum
duration
to
a
state
court
order.
the
court
is
giving
the
maximum
application
to
a
section
1450
that
state
law
would
invite.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
state
law
makes
very
clear,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that,
that
order
would
have
been
invalid
under
state
law.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
in
california,
there
will
not
be
an
adjudication
of
contempt
or
disobeyance
of
the
void
order.
that’s
the
california
rule,
it’s
generally
applicable.
your
honor,
i
had
read
ex
parte
fisk
back
in
1885
and
united
mine
workers
and
in
re
greene,
and
some
of
the
other
cases.
the
federal
rule
may
be
difficult
to
define
in
a
cosmic
way
but
at
least
i
think
where
there
is
a
void
judgment
within
the
meaning
of
norris-la
guardia
because
there
was
lack
of
jurisdiction
to
enter
it,
along
with
the
lack
of
due
process
in
the
sense
that
the
opportunity
to
attack
and
challenge
the
order
was
never
really
fairly
permitted,
that
there
are
very
serious
and
cogent
reasons
for
refusing
to
find
a
criminal
contempt
on
those
circumstances
and
we
develop
that
quite
in
our
brief.
this
case
does
not
need
to
turn
on
that.
but
i
think
it’s
a
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
you
have
to
go
a
long
way
before
you
get
to
that
point
in
this
case.
disagreement
there
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
respondent
union
would
not
prevail
here
if
the
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
right
and
i
think
that
issue
has
to
be
read,
has
to
be
determined
by
reading
section
1450
in
the
light
of
relevant
federal
policy
and
i
think
that
is
the
central
of
point
that
we
must
ultimately
return
to
after
considering
everything
else.
and
the
words
of
section
1450
are
brief
and
certainly
do
not
necessitate
the
kind
of
reading
that
it
has
been
given
to
it
by
the
petitioners
and
by
the
dissenting
judge.
i
think
it
comes
too
loud
and
clear
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
it
means
exactly
put
our
position
is
in
this
case.
the
section
states
that
all
injunctions,
orders
and
other
proceedings
had
in
such
action
prior
to
its
removal
shall
remain
in
full
course
in
effect
until
dissolved
or
modified
by
the
district
court.
now
in
order
to
know
what
it
is
that
shall
remain
in
full
force
and
effect,
until
dissolved
or
modified,
i
think
that
we
are
necessarily
led
to
inquire
as
to
what
the
state
order
said,
and
what
the
state
law
is
that
put
places
its
laws
upon
that
order.
here,
we
start
as
i
indicated
with
the
premise
that
the
state
court
order
was
of
limited
duration
and
we
feel
that
it’s
quite
clear
as
you
read
section
1450,
that
the
purpose
and
intent
in
plain
meaning
of
the
language
is
to
retain
that
state
court
order
in
all
of
its
substance
and
all
of
its
terms,
and
all
of
its
conditions,
precisely
in
the
same
manner
in
which
it
was
issued.
the
order
here
is
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
it
would
be
no
different
than
if
it
had
an
expressed
terminal
date,
june
4,
june
7,
whatever.
and
i
think
that
mr.
tichy’s
argument
recognizes
that
his
position
would
have
to
be
the
same
even
basing
an
order
of
that
kind.
now,
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
at
the
time
we
filed
the
motion
to
dissolve
of
course
there
was
an
order
and
we
try
to
give
it
a
little
bit
just
as
quickly
as
we
could
be
because
we
thought
that
it
was
improper.
however,
with
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
period
which
state
law
permitted
it
to
exist
then
there
was
no
order.
and
that’s
what
the
majority
held
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
certainly,
that
would
be
in
the
case
in
the
state
court.
in
the
absence
of
consent
by
a
dependent
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
after
removal
was
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes
and
that’s
what
gives
rise
to
this
case.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
case
came
to
the
federal
court
by
way
of
removal
and
we
are
trying
to
find
out
what
section
1450
did
at
that
point
whether
it
maintained
the
order
and
precisely
the
same
terms
and
conditions
and
with
the
same
duration
that
it
had
or
whether
that
it
converted
it
into
a
restraining
order
without
duration.
and
that’s
the
central
issue.
and
i
think
that
the
--
to
read
the
language
as
though
this
transformation
took
place
is
to
take
it
very
strain
view
both
of
the
language
and
the
policy
considerations
which
underlie
restraining
orders.
certainly
in
the
abstract,
an
injunction
is
extraordinary
remedy
to
be
issued
only
upon
a
strong
showing
of
irreparable
injury
and
the
other
standard
criteria.
a
restraining
order
without
notice
and
without
a
hearing
is
an
injunction
in
its
most
extreme
form
and
it
would
ordinarily
be
thought
a
part
from
any
particular
statutory
considerations
we
have
at
the
moment.
that
anyone
seeking
to
maintain
a
restraining
order
in
effect
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
indefinitely
would
have
a
very
strong
burden
of
bringing
the
matter
on
for
a
hearing
and
permitting
the
parties
to
make
their
considerations
as
known
to
the
court
as
to
whether
it
should
continue
or
not.
now
there
are
strong
policy
considerations
in
federal
law
which
supports
our
position
in
this
respect.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
either
way,
and
that
we
say
that
section
1450
would
be
--
to
strain
a
concept
beyond
any
reasonable
means
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes
and
that’s
what
the
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
also,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
and
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
know
of
no
state
case
that
would
support
that
proposition.
and
i
disagree
with
it
as
a
matter
of
analysis
and
logic.
and
no
cases
have
been
decided
that
would
support
that
proposition.
i
think
that
we
have
the
same
considerations
in
california
law
that
would
basically
be
applicable
under
rule
65

that
before
a
preliminary
injunction
can
be
issued,
there
must
be
notice
of
a
hearing
upon
the
conventional
types
of
issues
that
are
raised
by
applications
for
preliminary
injunctions
and
that
that
would
be
required
in
california
law
in
no
less
than
federal
rule
65
(b).
rule
65
(b)
does
reflect
federal
law
generally.
and
section
7
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
also
reflects
federal
law
with
respect
to
labor
disputes.
both
place
very
strict
time
restrictions
upon
the
duration
of
temporary
restraining
orders
which
are
issued
without
hearings.
section
1450
does
not
to
be
interpreted
to
conflict
with
those
policy
considerations
and
i
might
say,
although
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
labor
dispute
case
and
we
think
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
case
that
falls
within
the
norris-la
guardia
act.
that
the
interpretation
of
section
1450
which
is
before
the
court
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
your
honor.
the
interpretation
of
such
section
1450,
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
is
one
which
has
general
application.
section
1450
applies
to
all
classes
of
cases,
labor
cases
as
well
as
the
one
that
is
governed
by
norris-la
guardia
as
well
as
a
case
generally.
and
it
is
appropriate
to
examine
section
65
(b)
and
norris-la
guardia
act
to
see
what
policy
considerations
there
are
that
might
help
us
construe
section
1450.
and
those
considerations
in
brief
are
that
temporary
restraining
orders
are
not
to
be
permitted
to
endure
indefinitely
without
a
hearing.
and
section
1450
plainly
lends
itself
to
a
reading
of
that
kind
and
it
is
perfectly
obvious
as
mr.
tichy
has
conceded
that
if
you
do
not
read
it,
section
1450
in
that
way,
you
are
confronted
with
the
conflict
between
the
meaning
of
section
65
(b)
and
norris-la
guardia
in
appropriate
case
on
one
hand,
and
section
1450
on
the
other.
we
are
suggesting
a
reading
which
is
supported
not
only
by
the
language
of
purpose
of
section
1450
but
also
one
which
is
congruent
with
the
policy
that
we
find
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
the
remaining
point
which
i
would
like
to
deal
with
briefly
is
the
contention
that
even
though
we
may
be
right,
with
respect
to
our
view
of
section
1450,
that
the
ruling
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
converted
the
restraining
order
into
a
preliminary
injunction
so
that
from
that
point
on,
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction
in
effect
and
that
would
have
the
consequence
of
continuing
the
restraint
irrespective
of
what
may
have
happen
to
the
temporary
restraining
order.
now,
this
consequence
is
not
one
which
i
believe
the
district
court
judge
thought
that
he
was
dealing
with
when
he
denied
the
order
to
dissolve.
he
made
very
clear,
that
he
felt
that
he
was
simply
construing
section
1450
to
keep
that
the
–
strike
that.
he
felt
that
the
only
issue
that
he
was
ruling
on,
was
the
narrow
issue
of
sinclair
against
atkinson
which
was
raised
by
the
motion
to
dissolve,
which
had
to
do
only
with
whether
or
not
there
was
jurisdiction
to
maintain
that
order
in
effect.
and
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
felt
that
he
was
doing
anymore
than
that.
and
the
order,
which
he
handed
down,
was
entitled
an
order
denying
motion
to
dissolve
temporary
restraining
order.
there
is
no
notice
by
any
party
that
there
would
be
an
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
connection
with
the
hearing
upon
the
motion
to
dissolve.
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
or
conclusions
of
law
entered
by
the
district
judge.
he
did
not
think
that
he
was
entering
a
preliminary
injunction.
and
there
was
no
opportunity
really.
well,
i
don’t
want
to
go
further
than
i
have
to.
there
was
no
actual
hearing
in
which
evidentiary
matters
or
other
matters
were
brought
forward
and
considered
and
decided
which
would
ordinarily
be
relevant
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
this
hearing
in
this
motion
had
to
do
solely
with
whether
or
not,
the
order
was
sustainable
and
then
why
norris-la
guardia
act
and
that
was
the
single
ruling
that
was
made.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
the
obligation
of
the
moving
party
who
is
seeking
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
oh,
i
suppose
we
could
move
to
modify
it
or
perhaps
move
to
the
dissolve
it.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
it
was
not
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that
is
precisely
our
position
and
is
the
position
of
the
majority
in
the
ninth
circuit
as
well
because
we
got
a
preliminary
injunction.
it’s
an
argument
that
it
is
a
sort
of
being
put
together
after
all
of
the
events
in
this
case,
trying
to
find
some
way
in
which
this
motion
to
dissolve
to
be
turned
into
the
preliminary
of
the
hearing
upon
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
but
analytically,
it’s
simply
can’t
be
sustained.
it
was
never
a
hearing
that
was
never
ruling
with
respect
to
the
inference
or
the
entry
or
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
thank
you.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
union
was
found
to
have
violated
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
case
more
than
six
months
after
it
had
been
issued
without
hearing,
and
was
adjudicated
guilty
of
criminal
contempt.
the
basis
upon
which
the
petitioners
seek
to
sustain
that
finding
which
was
over
turned
by
the
court
below,
is
that
section
1450
of
title
28
converted
the
temporary
retraining
order
of
the
state
which
is
i
say
was
issued
without
a
hearing
into
an
order
of
unlimited
duration
so
that
it
continued
on
in
perpetuity
until
such
time
as
the
federal
court
might
act
on
it.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
that
is
what
he
said
and
essentially,
that
is
quite
happened.
there
was
a
telephone
notice
given
which
is
a
matter
of
common
practice
in
this
jurisdiction.
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
union
did
appear
at
the
time
that
the
original
restraining
order
was
issued.
it
was
no
hearing
in
the
ordinary
sense.
the
attorney
under
those
circumstances
has
handed
the
papers
two
or
three
minutes
before
a
corporate
takes
place
with
the
judge
and
such
arguments
as
can
be
put
together
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
or
maybe
made.
i
was
not
the
attorney
who
was
present
on
that
occasion
but
i
think
that
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
practice
to
represent
that
this
is
the
way
that
it
works
out.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that
they
will
be
and
i
think
that
is
particularly
true
in
labor
dispute
cases.
there
was
no
hearing
in
the
sense
that
i
think
you
had
just
use
the
phrase
however
that
is
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
papers,
collect
evidence,
talk
with
the
clients
and
witnesses
and
so
forth
and
bring
forth
some
kind
of
considerations
which
will
support
the
respondent’s
position.
and
either
by
way
of
affidavits
or
oral
testimony,
there
was
nothing
of
that
kind.
this
is
an
informal
courtesy
type
of
proceeding
which
has
developed
in
the
bar
of
the
san
francisco
bay
area
in
state
of
california.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
i
would
say
that
your
honor.
the
application
for
a
restraining
order
was
going
to
be
determined
within
a
manner
of
minutes
or
half
an
hour
or
whatever
time
it
took
just
to
talk
about
the
case
a
little
bit,
and
that’s
what
happened.
now,
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
your
honor,
that’s
just
another
way
of
saying
when
shall
the
case
be
set
down
for
return
on
the
return
date
for
the
year
in
the
order
to
show
cause
by
preliminary
injunction
not
be
issued.
and
either
the
judge
will
or
will
not
enter
a
temporary
restraining
order
pending
that
date
depending
on
how
he
feels
about
the
case.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
am
sure
there
was
in
the
sense
that
issuance
of
the
restraining
order
without
a
hearing
was
opposed
on
whatever
basis
the
attorney
for
the
union
could
come
up
with
on
that
short
notice.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
motion
to
dissolve,
your
honor.
that
was
simultaneous
with
the
petition
for
removals
so
that
the
motion
to
dissolve
is
filed
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
next
step
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
proceeding
of
this
kind
would
be
the
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction
on
the
part
of
the
moving
party
namely
they
person
seeking
it
and
that
would
be
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
not
that,
not
certain
with
any
certainty.
the
reason
that
i
hesitate,
mr.
justice,
is
that
conceivably
we
might
have
tried
to
appeal
from
the
ruling
on
motion
to
dissolve.
i
do
not
think
that,
that
would
have
been
in
an
appealable
order.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
case
seemed
to
be
difficult
to
align
your
honor.
in
this
field,
they
turn
on
the
ruined
facts.
a
general
rule
of
course
is
that
the
grant
or
denial
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
is
not
appealable.
the
grant
or
denial
or
preliminary
injunction
is
appealable.
now
it
is
of
course
true
that
the
particular
label
that
may
be
put
upon
the
order
is
not
determined
too.
and
there
are
cases
in
which
where
the
nature
of
the
motion,
the
kind
of
evidence
that
was
brought
forth
the
argument
that
was
heard
is
such
as
to
be
the
equivalent
of
the
raising
the
issues
that
would
be
raised
under
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
motion
to
dissolve
was
made
in
the
federal
court
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that
is
correct.
it
was
not
made
in
the
state
court.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
we
had
a
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
which
was
limited
to
the
norris-la
guardia
issue.
the
raising
as
we
did
at
that
time,
the
law
as
was
reflected
in
sinclair
against
atkinson.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
it
was
the
solid
ground
which
the
respondent
union
raised.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
you
can
file
a
motion
to
dissolve
in
the
federal
district
court
on
any
ground
that
you
think
will
ultimately
prevail
i
suppose.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
propriety
of
the
issues
of
its
injunction,
your
honor
turns
at
all
together
at
different
considerations
and
those
which
are
raised
in
the
motion
--on
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dissolve.
we
raised
the
narrow
jurisdictional
issue
as
to
whether
the
injunction
could
be
maintained
in
the
federal
district
court.
now
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
i
suspect
that
the
considerations
which
would
have
been
put
forth
would
be
those
which
deal
with
the
nature
of
the
dispute
whether
or
not
this
was
the
situation
which
could
or
should
be
arbitrated
whether
or
not
the
union
and
the
employers
were
party
to
the
contract
which
the
petitioners
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
doubt
it
if
it
would
have
been
appropriate
to
do
so.
the
answer
to
your
question
certainly
is
yes
in
the
theoretical
abstract
way,
mr.
justice
white.
but
the
ordinary
development
of
cases
like
this
is
to
raise
the
broader
equitable
issues
in
connection
with
the
hearing
upon
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
which
ordinarily
comes
on
the
return
date.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
oh!
we
don’t
need
to
go
that
far.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
our
position
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
oh!
yes,
as
far
as
the
--
yes,
at
the
time
that
we
made
the
motion.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
we
were
very
confident
that
time.
[laughter]
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
your
honor,
the
sequence
of
the
events
was
that
we
filed
the
petition
for
removal
and
the
motion
to
dissolve
on
may
19
and
it
was
heard
on
may
27.
boys
markets
came
down
on
june
1.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
and
the
court,
district
court
declined
to
rule
from
the
bench
after
hearing
our
arguments
on
the
sinclair,
having
been
advised
that
this
court
had
boys
markets
under
consideration
and
what
finger
in
the
air
to
see
which
[voice
overlap]
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes.
and
then
as
soon
as
boys
markets
came
down,
the
motion
to
dissolve
was
denied
and
only
on
the
ground
that
boys
markets
had
require
that
result
which,
mr.
justice
brennan
was
a
wrong
conclusion
and
we
have
develop
these
points
to
some
extent
in
our
brief.
this
is
not
a
boys
market’s
case.
but
we
never
had
an
opportunity
that
makes
from
the
motion
to
dissolve
to
discuss
those
matters
because
boys
markets
at
that
time
was
still
pending
and
we
were
relying
upon
sinclair.
the
central
issues
in
this
case,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
think
is
the
correct
interpretation
and
construction
to
be
given
section
1450
of
title
28.
now,
we
start
in
addressing
ourselves
to
that
question
what
i
think
is
a
firm
premise
and
that
is
the
state
court
order
did
have
an
expiration
date,
a
terminal
date,
a
maximum
duration
of
20
days
after
its
original
issuance.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
on
june
7.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
this
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit.
both
the
dissenting
judge
and
the
majority
agreed
with
the
fact
that
you
had
a
limited
duration,
a
maximum
duration
of
20
days
with
respect
to
that
state
court
order.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
statute
reads
that
the
return
date
upon
the
issuance
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
shall
be
no
later
than
15
days
after
its
issuance
or
for
good
cause
showing
20
days.
now
the
court
below
felt
that
it
was
a
realistic
view
approach
to
assume
that
the
20-day
period
probably
would
have
been
used
up
and
proceedings
before
the
state
court
if
the
case
had
remained
there.
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
good
sense
to
this
point
of
view
in
that
by
allowing
them
maximum
duration
to
a
state
court
order.
the
court
is
giving
the
maximum
application
to
a
section
1450
that
state
law
would
invite.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
state
law
makes
very
clear,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that,
that
order
would
have
been
invalid
under
state
law.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
in
california,
there
will
not
be
an
adjudication
of
contempt
or
disobeyance
of
the
void
order.
that’s
the
california
rule,
it’s
generally
applicable.
your
honor,
i
had
read
ex
parte
fisk
back
in
1885
and
united
mine
workers
and
in
re
greene,
and
some
of
the
other
cases.
the
federal
rule
may
be
difficult
to
define
in
a
cosmic
way
but
at
least
i
think
where
there
is
a
void
judgment
within
the
meaning
of
norris-la
guardia
because
there
was
lack
of
jurisdiction
to
enter
it,
along
with
the
lack
of
due
process
in
the
sense
that
the
opportunity
to
attack
and
challenge
the
order
was
never
really
fairly
permitted,
that
there
are
very
serious
and
cogent
reasons
for
refusing
to
find
a
criminal
contempt
on
those
circumstances
and
we
develop
that
quite
in
our
brief.
this
case
does
not
need
to
turn
on
that.
but
i
think
it’s
a
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
you
have
to
go
a
long
way
before
you
get
to
that
point
in
this
case.
disagreement
there
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
respondent
union
would
not
prevail
here
if
the
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
right
and
i
think
that
issue
has
to
be
read,
has
to
be
determined
by
reading
section
1450
in
the
light
of
relevant
federal
policy
and
i
think
that
is
the
central
of
point
that
we
must
ultimately
return
to
after
considering
everything
else.
and
the
words
of
section
1450
are
brief
and
certainly
do
not
necessitate
the
kind
of
reading
that
it
has
been
given
to
it
by
the
petitioners
and
by
the
dissenting
judge.
i
think
it
comes
too
loud
and
clear
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
it
means
exactly
put
our
position
is
in
this
case.
the
section
states
that
all
injunctions,
orders
and
other
proceedings
had
in
such
action
prior
to
its
removal
shall
remain
in
full
course
in
effect
until
dissolved
or
modified
by
the
district
court.
now
in
order
to
know
what
it
is
that
shall
remain
in
full
force
and
effect,
until
dissolved
or
modified,
i
think
that
we
are
necessarily
led
to
inquire
as
to
what
the
state
order
said,
and
what
the
state
law
is
that
put
places
its
laws
upon
that
order.
here,
we
start
as
i
indicated
with
the
premise
that
the
state
court
order
was
of
limited
duration
and
we
feel
that
it’s
quite
clear
as
you
read
section
1450,
that
the
purpose
and
intent
in
plain
meaning
of
the
language
is
to
retain
that
state
court
order
in
all
of
its
substance
and
all
of
its
terms,
and
all
of
its
conditions,
precisely
in
the
same
manner
in
which
it
was
issued.
the
order
here
is
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
it
would
be
no
different
than
if
it
had
an
expressed
terminal
date,
june
4,
june
7,
whatever.
and
i
think
that
mr.
tichy’s
argument
recognizes
that
his
position
would
have
to
be
the
same
even
basing
an
order
of
that
kind.
now,
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
at
the
time
we
filed
the
motion
to
dissolve
of
course
there
was
an
order
and
we
try
to
give
it
a
little
bit
just
as
quickly
as
we
could
be
because
we
thought
that
it
was
improper.
however,
with
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
period
which
state
law
permitted
it
to
exist
then
there
was
no
order.
and
that’s
what
the
majority
held
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
certainly,
that
would
be
in
the
case
in
the
state
court.
in
the
absence
of
consent
by
a
dependent
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
well,
after
removal
was
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes
and
that’s
what
gives
rise
to
this
case.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
the
case
came
to
the
federal
court
by
way
of
removal
and
we
are
trying
to
find
out
what
section
1450
did
at
that
point
whether
it
maintained
the
order
and
precisely
the
same
terms
and
conditions
and
with
the
same
duration
that
it
had
or
whether
that
it
converted
it
into
a
restraining
order
without
duration.
and
that’s
the
central
issue.
and
i
think
that
the
--
to
read
the
language
as
though
this
transformation
took
place
is
to
take
it
very
strain
view
both
of
the
language
and
the
policy
considerations
which
underlie
restraining
orders.
certainly
in
the
abstract,
an
injunction
is
extraordinary
remedy
to
be
issued
only
upon
a
strong
showing
of
irreparable
injury
and
the
other
standard
criteria.
a
restraining
order
without
notice
and
without
a
hearing
is
an
injunction
in
its
most
extreme
form
and
it
would
ordinarily
be
thought
a
part
from
any
particular
statutory
considerations
we
have
at
the
moment.
that
anyone
seeking
to
maintain
a
restraining
order
in
effect
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
indefinitely
would
have
a
very
strong
burden
of
bringing
the
matter
on
for
a
hearing
and
permitting
the
parties
to
make
their
considerations
as
known
to
the
court
as
to
whether
it
should
continue
or
not.
now
there
are
strong
policy
considerations
in
federal
law
which
supports
our
position
in
this
respect.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
either
way,
and
that
we
say
that
section
1450
would
be
--
to
strain
a
concept
beyond
any
reasonable
means
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes
and
that’s
what
the
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
also,
your
honor.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
and
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
i
know
of
no
state
case
that
would
support
that
proposition.
and
i
disagree
with
it
as
a
matter
of
analysis
and
logic.
and
no
cases
have
been
decided
that
would
support
that
proposition.
i
think
that
we
have
the
same
considerations
in
california
law
that
would
basically
be
applicable
under
rule
65
(b)
that
before
a
preliminary
injunction
can
be
issued,
there
must
be
notice
of
a
hearing
upon
the
conventional
types
of
issues
that
are
raised
by
applications
for
preliminary
injunctions
and
that
that
would
be
required
in
california
law
in
no
less
than
federal
rule
65
(b).
rule
65
(b)
does
reflect
federal
law
generally.
and
section
7
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
also
reflects
federal
law
with
respect
to
labor
disputes.
both
place
very
strict
time
restrictions
upon
the
duration
of
temporary
restraining
orders
which
are
issued
without
hearings.
section
1450
does
not
to
be
interpreted
to
conflict
with
those
policy
considerations
and
i
might
say,
although
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
labor
dispute
case
and
we
think
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
case
that
falls
within
the
norris-la
guardia
act.
that
the
interpretation
of
section
1450
which
is
before
the
court
--
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
yes,
your
honor.
the
interpretation
of
such
section
1450,
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
is
one
which
has
general
application.
section
1450
applies
to
all
classes
of
cases,
labor
cases
as
well
as
the
one
that
is
governed
by
norris-la
guardia
as
well
as
a
case
generally.
and
it
is
appropriate
to
examine
section
65
(b)
and
norris-la
guardia
act
to
see
what
policy
considerations
there
are
that
might
help
us
construe
section
1450.
and
those
considerations
in
brief
are
that
temporary
restraining
orders
are
not
to
be
permitted
to
endure
indefinitely
without
a
hearing.
and
section
1450
plainly
lends
itself
to
a
reading
of
that
kind
and
it
is
perfectly
obvious
as
mr.
tichy
has
conceded
that
if
you
do
not
read
it,
section
1450
in
that
way,
you
are
confronted
with
the
conflict
between
the
meaning
of
section
65
(b)
and
norris-la
guardia
in
appropriate
case
on
one
hand,
and
section
1450
on
the
other.
we
are
suggesting
a
reading
which
is
supported
not
only
by
the
language
of
purpose
of
section
1450
but
also
one
which
is
congruent
with
the
policy
that
we
find
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
the
remaining
point
which
i
would
like
to
deal
with
briefly
is
the
contention
that
even
though
we
may
be
right,
with
respect
to
our
view
of
section
1450,
that
the
ruling
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
converted
the
restraining
order
into
a
preliminary
injunction
so
that
from
that
point
on,
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction
in
effect
and
that
would
have
the
consequence
of
continuing
the
restraint
irrespective
of
what
may
have
happen
to
the
temporary
restraining
order.
now,
this
consequence
is
not
one
which
i
believe
the
district
court
judge
thought
that
he
was
dealing
with
when
he
denied
the
order
to
dissolve.
he
made
very
clear,
that
he
felt
that
he
was
simply
construing
section
1450
to
keep
that
the
–
strike
that.
he
felt
that
the
only
issue
that
he
was
ruling
on,
was
the
narrow
issue
of
sinclair
against
atkinson
which
was
raised
by
the
motion
to
dissolve,
which
had
to
do
only
with
whether
or
not
there
was
jurisdiction
to
maintain
that
order
in
effect.
and
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
felt
that
he
was
doing
anymore
than
that.
and
the
order,
which
he
handed
down,
was
entitled
an
order
denying
motion
to
dissolve
temporary
restraining
order.
there
is
no
notice
by
any
party
that
there
would
be
an
application
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
connection
with
the
hearing
upon
the
motion
to
dissolve.
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
or
conclusions
of
law
entered
by
the
district
judge.
he
did
not
think
that
he
was
entering
a
preliminary
injunction.
and
there
was
no
opportunity
really.
well,
i
don’t
want
to
go
further
than
i
have
to.
there
was
no
actual
hearing
in
which
evidentiary
matters
or
other
matters
were
brought
forward
and
considered
and
decided
which
would
ordinarily
be
relevant
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
this
hearing
in
this
motion
had
to
do
solely
with
whether
or
not,
the
order
was
sustainable
and
then
why
norris-la
guardia
act
and
that
was
the
single
ruling
that
was
made.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that’s
the
obligation
of
the
moving
party
who
is
seeking
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
oh,
i
suppose
we
could
move
to
modify
it
or
perhaps
move
to
the
dissolve
it.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
it
was
not
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
duane
b.
beeson
that
is
precisely
our
position
and
is
the
position
of
the
majority
in
the
ninth
circuit
as
well
because
we
got
a
preliminary
injunction.
it’s
an
argument
that
it
is
a
sort
of
being
put
together
after
all
of
the
events
in
this
case,
trying
to
find
some
way
in
which
this
motion
to
dissolve
to
be
turned
into
the
preliminary
of
the
hearing
upon
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
but
analytically,
it’s
simply
can’t
be
sustained.
it
was
never
a
hearing
that
was
never
ruling
with
respect
to
the
inference
or
the
entry
or
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
thank
you.
