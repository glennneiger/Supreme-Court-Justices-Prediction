unknown
speaker
well
assuming
on
the
state
law,
ordinarily
is,
you
know,
we
don’t
second
guess
courts
of
appeals.
there
determination
with
state
law
assuming
now
that
state
law
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
by
26
would
have
terminated
this
interim
restraining
order
at
the
end
of
20
days.
suppose
you
had
never
got
to
the
federal
court,
what
would
have
been
necessary
under
the
california
procedure
to
convert
that
20-day
interim
restraint
into
a
temporary
injunction?
unknown
speaker
beyond
the
20-day
restoration?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
just
been
a
motion
as
they
made
it
in
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
to
dismiss
and
had
it
been
denied.
unknown
speaker
well
i
gather
this
is
an
argument
that
under
1450,
even
if
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
its
interim
restraining
order
had
a
terminal
date.
unknown
speaker
once
it
was
removed,
the
statute
operates
on
that
order
--you
bet
--they
continue
it
until
it
is
in
fact
dissolve.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
there
was
no
opportunity
for
the
kind
of
hearing
to
which
you
refer
under
your
practice?
unknown
speaker
it
did
file
a
motion
to
vacate.
unknown
speaker
and
what
step
was
denied
--
what
other
step
could
you
have
taken?
unknown
speaker
there’s
nothing
you
could
have
done.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
is
that
clear?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
union
took
made
no
effort
to
appeal
this
denial
issue?
unknown
speaker
would
you
renew
your
motion
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
could
you
renew
your
motion
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
it
was
made
in
this
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
and
did
you
have
a
hearing
on
the
motion
there?
unknown
speaker
limited
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
but
you
weren’t
limited?
i
mean,
you
could
have
attack
the
injunction
on
any
ground
you
want
it
to.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
that
question
another
way.
in
what
respect
did
your
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
fall
short
of
being
inadequate
hearing
on
the
issue
of
the
propriety
of
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
boys
market
done
while
that
was
pending
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
was
going
down
within
three
or
four
days,
was
it
that?
unknown
speaker
and
on
what
date
would
that
run
out
mr.
beeson?
unknown
speaker
june
7.
unknown
speaker
mr.
beeson,
you
speak
of
20
days.
isn’t
there
something
the
statute
about
15?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
we
disagree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
no!
i
gather
here.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
an
operative
restraint
on
december
4
when
the
conduct
which
was
held
contentious.
unknown
speaker
so
the
issue
before
us
is
was
or
it
wasn’t?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you’re
really
saying
is
that
within
we
have
20
days,
and
there’s
no
order
in
effect
after
20
days
to
be
dissolved
or
modified
by
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
beeson,
before
you
get
to
that,
it’s
your
position
either
under
the
california
law
of
20
days,
or
the
federal
law
of
10
days,
this
order
was
dead
in
20
days?
unknown
speaker
either
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
read
--
you
read
1450
as
reading
into
the
restraining
order
that
this
shall
expire
in
20
days,
just
as
if
it
was
written
in
there?
unknown
speaker
of
course
the
state
statute
put
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
despite
--
unknown
speaker
and
also
true
that
you
--
there
was
no
way
you
could
go
after
the
“preliminary
injunction?”
unknown
speaker
well
if
this
--
what
i
mean
is,
if
the
temporary
restraining
order
had
merged
into
a
preliminary
injunction,
you
not
only
did
not
have
a
hearing,
you
had
no
way
of
attacking
it,
am
i
right?
well,
you
could
not
move
to
dissolve
the
preliminary
injunction,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
but
it
wasn’t
the
preliminary
injunction?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
thought
that
was
your
position?
unknown
speaker
considering
the
absolute
validity
for
the
first
of
argument
and
the
temporary
order,
when
did
it
become
a
preliminary
injunction?
unknown
speaker
and
the
case
you
have
supports
that
is
what?
in
the
federal
or
california?
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
goes
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
i
understood.
unknown
speaker
where
in
your
brief?
i
have
missed
it.

unknown
speaker
they
said
it
well,
24,
25,
and
26.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
motion
to
dissolve
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
that's
upon
20
days?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
did,
california
law
that
will
break
it
up?
unknown
speaker
what
could
be
that,
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
is
it
good
to
engage
except
the
good
cause
is
20
days?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
statute
in
existence
in
california?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
20
days?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
make
any
motion
to
continue
it?
no.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
20
days,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
i
take
it
is
that
even
if
the
california
law
was
that
this
order
was
to
last
20
days,
the
federal
statutes
said
it
was
to
continue
until
it
was
dissolved.
unknown
speaker
only
aside
from
state
law.
unknown
speaker
that’s
your
fundamental
position.
unknown
speaker
and
then
if
you
get
a
temporary
restraining
order
that
says,
“this
restraining
order
shall
be
effective
for
20
days
and
not
one
minute
longer.”
when
it
goes
on
to
the
federal
court,
it
gets
automatically
as
extended?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
your
position?
unknown
