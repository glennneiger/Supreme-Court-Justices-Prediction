justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
as
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
1450
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
court
which
provides
that
in
cases
removed
from
state
to
federal
court,
state
court
orders
issued
prior
to
the
removal,
shall
remain
in
effect
after
removal
until
modified
or
dissolved
by
the
federal
court.
in
this
case
the
california
state
court
issued
a
ex
parte
temporary
restraining
order
against
certain
strike
activities
of
the
respondent
union.
the
case
had
been
then
removed
to
a
federal
district
court.
over
six
months
later,
the
union
began
its
strike
activities
again.
the
district
court
held
that
the
union
was
in
criminal
contempt
of
the
restraining
order
and
imposed
a
substantial
fine.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
restraining
order
had
expired
long
before
the
date
of
the
alleged
contempt.
the
court
reasoned
that
under
the
limitations
imposed
by
both
state
and
federal
laws
for
the
duration
of
ex
parte
temporary
restraining
orders,
the
order
could
not
have
remained
in
effect
more
than
20
days
after
it
was
issued.
it
held
that
section
1450,
was
not
intended
to
go
along
indefinitely
for
the
life
of
the
ex
parte
temporary
restraining
orders,
and
case
is
removed
to
federal
court.
for
the
reasons
expressed
more
fully
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
with
that
interpretation
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
therefore
affirm
its
judgment.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result,
in
which
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
powell
joined.
