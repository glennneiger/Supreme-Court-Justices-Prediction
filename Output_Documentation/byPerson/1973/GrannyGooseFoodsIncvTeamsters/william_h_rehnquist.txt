justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
the
judge
by
denying
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
to
dissolve
thereby
continued
the
order
in
effect.
that
really
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
you
are
making
here.
that
is
not
an
obvious
conclusion
just
a
statement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i'm
--
my
reading
on
the
record
and
you
may
certainly
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
is
that
the
union’s
basic
position
on
the
motion
to
dissolve,
was
that
sinclair
against
atkinson
prevented
the
continuance
of
this
restraining
order,
not
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
but
simply
because
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act.
and
i
don’t
make
perhaps
quite
as
easily
as
you
do
the
jump
that
sort
of
a
hearing
is
the
same
thing
as
if
the
union
had
come
in
and
move
to
dissolve
a
temporary
restraining
order
on
the
merits
in
effect
before
the
time
set
for
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
injunction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
even
if
they
have
never
made
any
motion,
it’s
still
fair
to
say
they
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
defend
their
rules,
give
them
the
authority
to
come
in
and
move
to
dissolve
a
temporary
restraining
order.
is
that
enough
just
the
fact
that
they
have
the
opportunity
to
do
it,
to
convert
a
temporary
restraining
order
into
preliminary
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
under
california
law
that
this
type
of
proceeding
taking
place
in
the
state
court
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
have
converted
the
temporary
restraining
order
into
a
preliminary
injunction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
order
by
its
terms
did
not
have
a
specific
terminal
date,
did
it?
it
just
said
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
just
said
pending
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
injunction
you
are
enjoined
from
doing
such
and
such.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
argument
i
understand
from
your
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
is
even
if
it
is
said,
you
are
enjoined
until
june
4
or
june
7
form
doing
this,
you
say
that
once
it
went
into
federal
court,
you
were
enjoined
in
july
and
august
as
well.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
not
at
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
had
basically
a
one,
two
punch,
the
removal
and
the
motion
to
dissolve
and
under
the
state
of
law
that
the
case
was
going
to
be
all
over.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
judge
of
the
superior
court
of
alameda
county
it
said
in
effect,
“i
don’t
care
what
state
law
says
and
what
limitations
are
on
a
temporary
restraining
order.
i
am
making
this
one
good
for
a
year
and
the
order
by
its
terms
provided
they
would
last
for
a
year.”
and
then
the
same
procedural
history
had
obtained.
do
you
think
that
you
would
have
been
bound
to
appeal
or
do
something
or
do
you
think
you
could
just
have
followed
at
the
order
at
the
end
of
20
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
do
you
challenge
that
invalidity?
do
you
have
to
appeal
as
some
of
our
cases
like
walker
against
birmingham
have
indicated
or
may
you
simply
disobey
it
even
though
by
its
terms,
it
prohibits
the
concept?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
disagree
with
mr.
tichy
that
a
comparable
motion
to
dissolve
if
it
had
been
made
a
superior
court
of
alameda
county,
you
say
that
would
not
have
converted
this
order
into
a
temporary
--
into
a
preliminary
injunction
under
california
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tichy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily,
you
did
had
a
hearing
on
preliminary
injunction,
and
the
court
had
said,
“all
right,
it’s
ordered
that
a
preliminary
injunction
issue.”
you
would
have
prepared
a
document
and
submitted
it
to
counsel
entitled
preliminary
injunction,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
how
do
this
appellation
case
and
the
others
that
you
cite
treat
that
problem?
that
basically,
you
need
not
only
a
hearing
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction,
but
when
the
court
rules,
you
need
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law,
and
a
description
of
the
conduct
to
be
enjoin.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
take
avenge
that
should
fill
an
affidavit
of
default,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
it
can
be
continued
on
the
court’s
motion,
you
would
not
have
to
apply
for
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
the

by
denying
the
