mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
in
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
presents
three
major
issues.
these
are,
whether
or
not
section
1450,
the
federal
removal
statute
takes
precedence
over
state
law
concerning
the
effective
period
of
a
removed
state
court
injunctive
order.
secondly,
whether
section
1450
takes
precedence
over
conflicting
provisions
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
thirdly,
whether
or
not,
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
dissolve
a
removed
state
court
restraining
order
is
tantamount
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
for
purposes
of
enforcement.
the
facts
in
this
case
arise
out
of
a
contractual
dispute
in
a
labor
situation.
teamsters’
local
70
and
the
companies
involved
here
had
for
many
years,
been
parties
of
national
master
freight
agreement
and
the
local
70
supplemental
agreement.
preparatory
to
1970
negotiations,
the
national
food
industry
negotiating
committee
of
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
notified
that
the
companies
that
the
union
committee
desire
to
negotiate
changes
and
revisions
in
the
existing
agreements.
the
critical
provision
here
is
that
the
notice
did
not
terminate
the
existing
agreements
but
they
did
continue
in
effect.
the
union,
teamsters
local
70,
was
most
desirous
to
break
away
from
national
negotiations
and
to
impose
a
new
independent
agreement
where
the
company
is
involved.
the
vehicle
which
used
to
enforce
this
approach
was
a
work
stoppage,
initially
against
granny
goose
foods
and
sunshine
biscuits,
and
normally
against
standard
brands.
the
companies
believed
that
because
it
was
compulsory
grievance
procedures
and
the
collective-bargaining
agreements,
that
the
matter
should
be
resolved
in
accordance
with
the
grievance
procedures
rather
than
through
work
stoppage.
consequently,
when
the
strike
continued
to
persist,
granny
goose
foods
and
sunshine
biscuits
went
into
state
court
to
seek
a
restraining
order
against
the
illegal
strike
activity.
in
advance
of
the
hearing,
the
attorney
for
local
70
was
notified.
he
in
fact
appeared
before
the
judge.
he
presented
arguments
to
the
court
that
he
believed
that
the
contract
had
not
been
breached,
that
there
was
no
basis
for
a
restraining
order
but
despite
the
existence
of
these
arguments,
a
restraining
order
was
in
fact
issued.
thereafter
the
picketing
of
work
stoppage
expanded
to
standard
branch,
where
standard
branch
of
course
joined
as
a
party
plaintiff
and
the
litigation
went
to
court
inside
of
modified
temporary
restraining
order.
but
prior
to
the
application,
again
local
70’s
attorney
was
advised.
he
did
not
personally
appear
in
alameda
county
there’s
a
practice
that
no
labor
injunction
will
issue
unless
the
labor
union’s
attorney
has
a
chance
to
make
the
position
of
the
union
known.
the
court
thereupon
insisted
the
counsel
for
the
union
be
called.
it
was
reached
in
his
office.
the
judge
talked
with
him
over
the
phone.
the
union’s
attorney
advised
he
was
relying
on
the
same
arguments
and
initially
presented
when
granny
goose
foods
and
sunshine
biscuits
appeared.
after
hearing
the
argument
of
counsel,
the
judge
then
granted
the
modified
restraining
order
which
is
an
issue
in
this
particular
case.
the
date
of
the
modified
restraining
order
was
may
18,
1970.
and
that
has
significance
to
this
court
in
the
boys
markets
versus
retail
clerks.
it
was
up
before
this
court
and
no
decision
have
been
rendered.
the
union
believes
that
atkinson
versus
sinclair
was
still
the
law
with
regard
to
federal
injunctive
orders
incite
to
have
the
matter
removed
to
federal
court.
and
what
has
to
be
a
classic
case
of
forum
shopping,
the
union
filed
a
petition,
removed
the
action
to
federal
court
hoping
to
rely
on
atkinson
versus
sinclair
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order,
and
an
essence
to
abate
the
entire
action
and
proceedings
that
occurred
in
state
court.
when
the
motions
came
on
for
hearing,
it
was
the
position
of
the
company’s
that
atkinson
versus
sinclair
was
that
the
applicable
law
this
court
having
indicated
enough
code
that
it
may
review
the
application
of
atkinson
versus
sinclair
and
having
before
it
boys
market.
we
relied
on
the
arguments
which
were
being
presented
to
this
court
the
boys
market.
the
judge
took
the
matter
under
submission
and
on
june
4,
1970,
seventeen
days
after
the
issuance
of
the
modified
temporary
restraining
order,
the
district
judge
denied
the
motion
to
dissolve
thereby
continuing
the
order
in
effect.
it’s
important
to
note,
that
between
june
4,
1970
and
december
1,
1970,
no
answer
or
responsive
pleading
was
ever
filed
by
the
union
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well,
i
think
there
are
two
points
to
be
made
here.
one
is,
that
the
contempt
proceedings
in
the
court
and
moving
on
a
motion
raised
by
the
union,
that
section
527
in
a
state
law
applied,
thereby
causing
abatement
of
the
order
after
15
days
replied
and
i
quote,
“i
am
satisfied
that
my
ruling
of
june
4
in
which
i
denied
the
motion
to
dissolve
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
continues
in
full
force
and
affect
the
orders.”
so
the
first
thing
we
have
is
the
judge’s
own
intention
as
submitted
in
the
contempt
proceeding.
secondly,
and
this
of
course,
gets
to
my
argument,
but
i’ll
address
myself
to
it
at
this
point.
we
are
talking
about
really
two
concepts
when
you
distinguish
between
a
restraining
order
and
a
preliminary
injunction.
in
a
restraining
order
situation,
generally
speaking,
you
wouldn’t
have
notice
or
opportunity
defend.
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
believe
that
that
did
exists
but
this
primary
distinction
between
a
preliminary
injunction,
and
a
temporary
restraining
order
has
noticed
an
opportunity
to
defend.
in
the
case
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order,
the
union
filed
the
notice.
in
fact,
i
had
an
order
short
in
time
for
the
hearing
on
that
particular
proceeding
and
an
essence
had
adequate
notice
by
its
ordered
mission
in
seeking
the
proceedings
and
obviously
had
the
opportunity
to
defend.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
the
choice
rest
entirely
with
the
union
as
to
which
argument
it
wish
to
present
on
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order.
now
i
could
have
raised
an
issue
as
to
the
merits.
it
could
have
controverted
the
factual
issues
but
it
did
not
do
so
and
chose
to
rely
exclusively
an
atkinson
versus
sinclair.
and
the
fact
that
it
chose
to
rely
on
a
narrow
tactical
approach
of
this,
did
not
deprive
of
the
opportunity
which
is
a
critical
point
i
believe
to
defend
on
whatever
point
it
felt
would
best
defeat
the
existence
of
the
restraining
order.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
in
this
case,
the
issue
that
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
vacating
the
contempt
judgment
was
the
fact
that
section
527
in
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure
apparently
imposed
some
sort
of
20-day
limitation
on
the
duration
of
state
court
orders.
now,
this
particular
section,
applies
only
to
orders
issued
without
notice
and
we
believe
that
there
was
adequate
notice
in
this
case
if
in
fact
the
court
had
reach
that
issue.
but
more
importantly
than
this,
the
law
in
california
is
that
where
you
have
proceedings
which
continue
the
order
in
effect.
and
they
take
into
account
such
things
as
merely
getting
a
continuance
on
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
in
fact
cases
which
are
cited
by
the
respondents
in
this
situation
rely
or
which
are
relied
upon
by
the
respondents
in
this
particular
case,
include
cases
where
the
court
specifically
note
that
you
can
continue
the
restraining
order
through
all
this
other
types
of
proceedings.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
it
would
have
continued
the
restraining
order
in
effect
and
the
domination
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
restraining
order
or
preliminary
injunction
would
be
a
relevant
for
contempt
purposes.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
if
the
union
had
taken
the
same
action
that
it
did
here
at
federal
court,
the
fact
that
that
motion
was
dissolved
i
believe
under
california
law,
it
would
have
the
effect
of
continuing
the
order
for
purposes
of
[voice
overlap]
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
that
would
automatically
have
converted
your
interim
restraint
into
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
believe
it
would,
your
honors.
and
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
the
point
that
you
raised
concerning
interpreting
state
law.
that’s
what
this
case
is
all
about.
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct,
it
would
require
federal
courts
and
all
of
the
50
jurisdictions
and
50
states
in
which
they
sought
to
go
into
a
wholesale
witch-hunt
to
determine
what
state
law
was
in
terms
of
restraining
orders
and
then
you
have
the
complex
ambiguities
which
are
present
in
this
case
resolving
and
conflicting
interpretations
which
might
exist,
despair
treatment
through
out
the
federal
judiciary
in
a
vast
ways
to
federal
time
involved
in
state
questions.
that’s
why
congress
when
it
enacted
section
1450
dealt
specifically
with
regard
to
the
duration
of
removed
orders
making
it
to
continue
in
effect
subject
only
to
dissolution
of
modification
to
avoid
this
wholesale
investigation
that
would
be
imposed
upon
the
federal
judiciary
in
cases
removed
from
state
court.
we
believe
that
the
particular
statute
in
this
case,
1450
is
clear
on
its
face.
it
talks
first
of
all
in
terms
of
all
injunctions.
it
is
not
restricted
to
injunctive
orders
which
have
no
duration
under
state
court.
secondly,
the
language
is
until
dissolve
or
modified
by
the
district
court.
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
this
restraining
order
was
set
for
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
correct.
that
is
an
essence
in
our
position,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
it
stands
from
--
excuse
me,
basic
concepts
of
congressional
legislation
and
that
being
that
the
right
to
remove
is
a
matter
of
legislative
raise.
and
the
union
in
this
case
assumed
the
benefits
as
well
as
the
burdens
of
the
statute.
the
benefit
it
thought
it
had
was
that
it
could
remove
the
state
court
to
a
forum
shopping
or
remove
the
federal
court
and
through
forum
shopping
obtain
the
benefits
of
atkinson
versus
sinclair
and
the
noble
matter
thrown
out.
the
burden
that
it
assumed
was
it
had
the
moving
obligation
to
go
into
court
and
seek
the
dissolution
or
modification
the
order.
and
until
it
did
so,
the
order
continued
in
effect
pursuant
to
section
1450.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
it
didn’t.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right,
your
honor
because
it
transferred
the
burden
of
proceeding
because
the
union
could
defend
it.
we
don’t
even
have
to
talk
about
it
in
a
labor
management
context.
the
defendant
is
the
only
person
that
can
remove
an
injunctive
proceeding
to
a
federal
court
because
a
complaint
for
injunctive
relief
would
be
directed
the
answer
to
defendant
and
only
the
defendant
has
a
right
under
the
act.
because
he
is
broken
up
to
process,
the
law
transfers
the
burden
from
the
plaintiff
to
the
defendant
to
bring
the
issue
before
the
court
because
the
plaintiff
would
have
brought
the
issue
before
the
court
under
his
original
order
has
been
deprived
of
that
because
the
action
of
the
defendant.
we
believe
that
with
regard
to
section
1450,
there
are
some
additional
factors
which
may
assist
the
court
in
its
interpretation.
in
this
regard
it’s
significant
to
note
that
there
are
attachment
provisions
in
section
1450
which
congress
specifically
makes
the
enforcement
subject
to
state
law.
it’s
obvious
in
drafting
1450
congress
had
its
command
the
language
to
make
a
state
court
order,
subject
to
state
law.
however,
it
did
not
do
so
with
regard
to
injunctives
and
retraining
orders.
the
only
conclusion
that
can
be
reached
is
not
making
it
referable
to
state
law
that
congress
intended
that
the
specific
language
of
1450
would
apply
under
the
restraining
order
would
continue
in
effect.
now,
just
to
add
some
emphasis
if
i
could
to
my
position,
that
this
would
involve
the
court
in
some
sort
of
wholesale
involvement
and
the
interpretation
of
state
law.
it’s
significant
to
note
that
there
at
least
three
major
arguments
that
could
be
made
in
a
support
of
the
position
that
527
did
not
cause
this
particular
order
to
dissolve.
first
of
all,
527
applies
only
to
orders
issued
without
notice.
in
this
case
definitely,
i
could
be
made
that
this
was
a
restraining
order
issue
with
notice.
additionally,
527
does
not
cause
an
order
to
expire
automatically.
if
there
is
some
act
of
continuance
in
this
case
we
believe
the
denial
to
motion
to
dissolve
was
an
essence
of
type
of
action
which
resolved
in
a
continuants.
and
more
importantly,
you
have
here
in
this
particular
situation,
a
15-day
statute.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
june
4th
order
it
was
17
days
after
the
issuance
of
the
modified
restraining
order.
and
the
judge
entered
into
some
sort
of
speculative
wishful
thinking
that
the
order
would
have
continued
in
effect
for
20
days
rather
than
15
days
and
it’s
in
fact
it
assumed
the
order
was
in
effect
on
june
4,
there
is
but
one
reason
that
it
could
have
been
in
effect
on
june
4
and
it
was
not
section
527
of
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure,
it
was
1450
which
we
rely
on
this
court.
we
also
believe
that
1450
must
take
precedence
over
the
federal
rules
and
several
procedure
more
particularly
rule
65
(b).
in
this
regard,
we
rely
on
28
u.s.c.
section
2071,
which
provides
that
the
rules
of
this
court
and
of
other
courts
must
be
consistent
with
acts
of
congress
to
the
extent
if
any,
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
rule
65
(b),
and
section
1450,
then
of
course
under
28
u.s.c.
2071
1450
would
prevail.
furthermore,
1450
is
specifically
directed
to
remove
orders.
rule
65
(b)
is
not.
it
is
resting
in
the
note
that
neither
the
legislative
history
of
rule
65
(b)
nor
the
legislative
history
of
1450
would
suggest
that
somehow
or
another
that
1450
was
in
any
respect
to
be
subservient
to
rule
65
(b).
and
furthermore,
even
if
65
(b)
did
apply
in
this
case,
it
applies
only
to
situations
where
there
is
an
order
issued
without
notice
and
as
we
indicated
previously
we
believe
that
there
was
efficient
notice
in
this
particular
case
to
dispense
any
of
the
time
limits
set
forth
in
65
(b).
in
summation,
we
believe
that
1450
should
prevail
over
state
laws
as
well
as
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
with
regard
to
the
duration
of
a
removed
state
court
restraining
order.
that
even
if
this
court
were
to
engage
in
analysis
of
the
state
law
or
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
65
(b),
that
the
order
would
have
still
continue
in
effect
and
the
contempt
proceedings
would
have
been
appropriate
at
the
time
they
occurred.
and
furthermore,
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order
was
tantamount
to
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction
for
purposes
of
continuing
the
injunction
effect
for
enforcement.
and
these
grounds,
jointly
and
alternatively,
we
submit
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
vacated
and
that
the
contempt
judgment
issued
by
the
district
court
should
be
reinstated
in
its
entirety.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
opportunity
to
defend
a
modified
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
case,
it
must
be
realized
that
this
was
an
amended
complaint
merely
to
include
an
additional
plaintiff.
there
had
been
a
prior
hearing
on
initial
temporary
restraining
order
and
which
according
to
my
affidavit
which
is
the
only
one
which
is
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case,
mr.
silbart
appeared
before
the
judge
and
argued
vigorously.
now,
there
is
also
within
my
affidavit
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
on
pages
52
and
53.
copies
of
the
documents
were
served
on
mr.
silbart
shortly
before
the
hearing
before
judge
locero.
both
mr.
silbart
and
i
were
present
at
this
hearing
and
mr.
silbart
presented
the
viewpoint
of
the
union.
and
that
there
was
breach
of
contract
and
that
the
court
should
not
grant
the
temporary
restraining
order
despite
argument
by
defendant’s
counsel
judge
locero
granted
the
temporary
restraining
order.
the
same
matter
is
contained
on
pages
50
and
51,
also,
one
of
my
affidavits
in
this
matter.
if
i
can
impress
the
court
of
one
thing,
i
wish
to
impress
it
of
this
fact.
we
do
not
believe
that
labor
injunctions
are
matters
which
are
easily
obtained
in
state
court.
there
are
very
rigorous
procedures
which
are
followed
because
very
basically,
the
san
francisco
bay
area
is
a
labor
area.
and
we
follow
these
rules
when
we
go
into
court
to
get
these
injunctive
orders,
and
when
the
attorney
for
the
union
comes
down
there
and
he
has
his
people
in
the
courtroom
before
he
goes
in
to
see
the
judge
and
he
says
there
are
strikers
and
there
are
in
strike.
he
goes
and
makes
the
best
arguments
that
he
can.
and
in
this
case,
he
contended
that
the
restraining
order,
excuse
me
--
that
the
contract
was
of
no
force
in
effect
and
therefore
was
not
being
breach
and
therefore
that
there
was
no
temporary
restraining
order
which
should
be
ordered.
under
the
circumstances,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
initial
complaint
and
initial
hearing,
then
an
amendment
of
the
complaint
just
to
add
an
additional
party
plaintiff
that
the
matter
was
discussed
with
the
counsel
for
the
union
in
advance
of
the
hearing,
that
the
court
in
fact
made
a
telephonic
communication
with
the
counsel
for
the
union
before
the
hearing
--
before
the
restraining
order
was
issued.
there
was
more
than
sufficient
time
to
be
familiar
not
only
with
the
moving
papers,
but
with
the
issues
which
were
involved
in
the
particular
situation.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
enforcement,
it
would
have
had
the
effect
of
preliminary
injunction
upon
the
denial
with
the
motion
to
dissolve
which
would
have
been
in
june
4,
1970.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
appellation
volunteers
cases
on
point,
i
believe
that
morning
telegraph
is
on
point.
in
fact,
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
a
restraining
order
is
tantamount
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
for
purposes
[voice
overlap]
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
and
i
wish
also
to
point
out,
that
this
has
been
considered
i
believe
by
the
appellate
courts
on
numerous
occasions
because
as
was
pointed
out
earlier
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
correct.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
in
those
particular
cases
felt
that
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
that
that
opportunity
was
given
to
the
defendant
to
raise
the
issues
which
were
in
defense
that
the
restraining
order
was
efficiently
particular
on
its
face
so
that
the
motion
denying
the
--
or
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
is
tantamount
to
the
reinstatement
of
the
restraining
order
was
a
preliminary
injunction.
now
in
these
cases,
one
additional
point
that
should
be
kept
in
mind,
with
regards
to
the
possibility
of
findings,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
there
was
no
answer
and
oppose
it
any
time
in
this
particular
case
even
up
through
the
situation
where
contempt
judgment
was
awarded.
so,
consequently
under
the
rule
8
(b)
of
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
all
allegations
or
complaints
are
admitted
including
those
factual
and
legal
conclusions.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
for
purposes
of
considering
the
complaint
as
a
setting
forth
-–excuse
me,
perhaps
i
should
state
it
this
way.
the
material
allegations
of
the
complaint
were
never
controverted.
and
the
issues
that
were
presented
in
terms
of
our
request
for
restraining
order
in
terms
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
and
the
issues
of
contempt
proceedings
are
very,
very
fundamental.
in
the
case
of
the
restraining
order
what
we
were
talking
about
was:
number
one
was
there
contract
in
effect
and
number
two
was
there
a
grievance
procedure,
and
number
three
was
there
a
strike?
when
we
got
to
the
motion
to
dissolve,
the
only
issue
which
the
union
chose
to
raise
was
whether
or
not,
atkinson
versus
sinclair
replied.
and
when
we
got
to
the
contempt
proceedings,
the
only
issue
was
whether
or
not,
there
was
in
fact
a
strike
occurring
at
that
particular
time.
now
all
of
these
things
were
totally
uncontroverted
particularly
at
the
contempt
stage
when
no
contrary
evidence
was
presented
or
whatsoever.
so
the
fundamental
factual
issues
were
always
undisputed.
it
was
a
legal
impact
to
be
given
to
those
particular
facts
which
was
this
positive
as
far
as
the
core
was
concerned
whether
or
not
a
restraining
order
should
be
issued
initially
whether
or
not
the
motion
to
dissolve
should
be
denied,
and
whether
or
not
a
contempt
judgment
should
be
entered.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
take
issue
with
that,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
under
1450
that
i
would
continue
to
have
a
restraining
order
if
it
continued
two
days
or
two
years.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
that
i
take
issue.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
mcdonald’s
case
which
is
cited
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
take
issue
with
the
interpretation
that
there
is
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
527
is
in
existence,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
your
honor.
it
says
on
its
face,
15
days
and
20
days
but
the
courts
have
long
since
recognized
and
then
i
cite
the
mcdonald
versus
superior
court
case
which
is
in
our
brief,
that
whether
it’s
good
cause
it
may
be
continued
for
a
longer
period
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
and
in
this
particular
issue
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
you
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
your
honor
in
the
mcdonald
versus
superior
court
case,
it
was
the
action
of
the
defendant
and
asking
for
continuance
on
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction
which
continued
that
outside
the
scope
of
527.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
precisely.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
our
fundamental
position.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
a
position,
i
believe,
not
only
of
the
companies
in
this
case
but
if
congress
enacting
1450
because
the
removal
action
that
surely
breaks
up
the
state
court
proceedings
and
because
the
defendant
shows
to
remove
it
and
he
has
a
burden
of
proceeding
to
dissolve
it.
i
wish
to
raise
a
couple
additional
points
before
my
time
runs
out.
first
of
all,
in
the
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
respondents
contended
that
this
was
a
boys
market
case.
it
wasn’t
until
they
filed
the
brief
in
this
matter
before
this
court
that
they
raise
the
issue
that
this
might
not
be
a
boys
market
case.
the
issue
was
never
litigated
before
and
under
rule
41
(d)
and
(e)
of
the
supreme
court,
it
is
not
properly
before
the
court
at
this
time.
furthermore,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
if
it
were
to
analyze
boys
market
and
answer
implications
from
the
policy
standpoint
of
this
case,
but
let’s
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
a
301
suit,
that
was
removed
from
state
court
to
federal
court.
and
from
the
time
of
lincoln
mills,
the
time
of
boys
market
it's
always
been
recognized.
this
has
been
the
purpose
of
301
to
define
state
courts
of
jurisdiction
on
this
matter.
and
if
we
were
now
to
impose
those
la-guardia
standards
on
every
state
court
removed
injunctive
order
which
are
more
stringent
than
state
court,
it
would
have
a
natural
effect
of
disposing
a
state
court
jurisdiction
because
unions
would
in
every
case
will
move
the
matter
to
federal
court
where
they
could
have
more
stringent
procedure
rules
which
the
employer
or
the
companies
would
have
to
meet
when
they
sought
to
maintain
an
injunctive
or
a
restraining
order.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right.
and
i
think
that
when
this
court
ruled
on
boys
market,
it
recognized
that
there
was
this
conflict
between
state
law
and
federal
law
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
boys
market
decision
overturn
atkinson
versus
sinclair.
we
believe
that
section
1450
is
in
fact
this
positive
in
this
particular
case
that
the
problems
that
we
have
had
to
go
through
here
today
analyzing
state
law
or
indicative
of
the
problems
of
the
entire
judiciary
would
have
to
go
through
with
every
removed
restraining
order
injunctive
order
case.
consequently,
we
believe
that
1450
should
prevail
over
state
laws
as
well
as
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
furthermore,
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order
was
tantamount
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
for
purposes
of
enforcement.
thank
you.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
in
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
presents
three
major
issues.
these
are,
whether
or
not
section
1450,
the
federal
removal
statute
takes
precedence
over
state
law
concerning
the
effective
period
of
a
removed
state
court
injunctive
order.
secondly,
whether
section
1450
takes
precedence
over
conflicting
provisions
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
thirdly,
whether
or
not,
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
dissolve
a
removed
state
court
restraining
order
is
tantamount
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
for
purposes
of
enforcement.
the
facts
in
this
case
arise
out
of
a
contractual
dispute
in
a
labor
situation.
teamsters’
local
70
and
the
companies
involved
here
had
for
many
years,
been
parties
of
national
master
freight
agreement
and
the
local
70
supplemental
agreement.
preparatory
to
1970
negotiations,
the
national
food
industry
negotiating
committee
of
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
notified
that
the
companies
that
the
union
committee
desire
to
negotiate
changes
and
revisions
in
the
existing
agreements.
the
critical
provision
here
is
that
the
notice
did
not
terminate
the
existing
agreements
but
they
did
continue
in
effect.
the
union,
teamsters
local
70,
was
most
desirous
to
break
away
from
national
negotiations
and
to
impose
a
new
independent
agreement
where
the
company
is
involved.
the
vehicle
which
used
to
enforce
this
approach
was
a
work
stoppage,
initially
against
granny
goose
foods
and
sunshine
biscuits,
and
normally
against
standard
brands.
the
companies
believed
that
because
it
was
compulsory
grievance
procedures
and
the
collective-bargaining
agreements,
that
the
matter
should
be
resolved
in
accordance
with
the
grievance
procedures
rather
than
through
work
stoppage.
consequently,
when
the
strike
continued
to
persist,
granny
goose
foods
and
sunshine
biscuits
went
into
state
court
to
seek
a
restraining
order
against
the
illegal
strike
activity.
in
advance
of
the
hearing,
the
attorney
for
local
70
was
notified.
he
in
fact
appeared
before
the
judge.
he
presented
arguments
to
the
court
that
he
believed
that
the
contract
had
not
been
breached,
that
there
was
no
basis
for
a
restraining
order
but
despite
the
existence
of
these
arguments,
a
restraining
order
was
in
fact
issued.
thereafter
the
picketing
of
work
stoppage
expanded
to
standard
branch,
where
standard
branch
of
course
joined
as
a
party
plaintiff
and
the
litigation
went
to
court
inside
of
modified
temporary
restraining
order.
but
prior
to
the
application,
again
local
70’s
attorney
was
advised.
he
did
not
personally
appear
in
alameda
county
there’s
a
practice
that
no
labor
injunction
will
issue
unless
the
labor
union’s
attorney
has
a
chance
to
make
the
position
of
the
union
known.
the
court
thereupon
insisted
the
counsel
for
the
union
be
called.
it
was
reached
in
his
office.
the
judge
talked
with
him
over
the
phone.
the
union’s
attorney
advised
he
was
relying
on
the
same
arguments
and
initially
presented
when
granny
goose
foods
and
sunshine
biscuits
appeared.
after
hearing
the
argument
of
counsel,
the
judge
then
granted
the
modified
restraining
order
which
is
an
issue
in
this
particular
case.
the
date
of
the
modified
restraining
order
was
may
18,
1970.
and
that
has
significance
to
this
court
in
the
boys
markets
versus
retail
clerks.
it
was
up
before
this
court
and
no
decision
have
been
rendered.
the
union
believes
that
atkinson
versus
sinclair
was
still
the
law
with
regard
to
federal
injunctive
orders
incite
to
have
the
matter
removed
to
federal
court.
and
what
has
to
be
a
classic
case
of
forum
shopping,
the
union
filed
a
petition,
removed
the
action
to
federal
court
hoping
to
rely
on
atkinson
versus
sinclair
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order,
and
an
essence
to
abate
the
entire
action
and
proceedings
that
occurred
in
state
court.
when
the
motions
came
on
for
hearing,
it
was
the
position
of
the
company’s
that
atkinson
versus
sinclair
was
that
the
applicable
law
this
court
having
indicated
enough
code
that
it
may
review
the
application
of
atkinson
versus
sinclair
and
having
before
it
boys
market.
we
relied
on
the
arguments
which
were
being
presented
to
this
court
the
boys
market.
the
judge
took
the
matter
under
submission
and
on
june
4,
1970,
seventeen
days
after
the
issuance
of
the
modified
temporary
restraining
order,
the
district
judge
denied
the
motion
to
dissolve
thereby
continuing
the
order
in
effect.
it’s
important
to
note,
that
between
june
4,
1970
and
december
1,
1970,
no
answer
or
responsive
pleading
was
ever
filed
by
the
union
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well,
i
think
there
are
two
points
to
be
made
here.
one
is,
that
the
contempt
proceedings
in
the
court
and
moving
on
a
motion
raised
by
the
union,
that
section
527
in
a
state
law
applied,
thereby
causing
abatement
of
the
order
after
15
days
replied
and
i
quote,
“i
am
satisfied
that
my
ruling
of
june
4
in
which
i
denied
the
motion
to
dissolve
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
continues
in
full
force
and
affect
the
orders.”
so
the
first
thing
we
have
is
the
judge’s
own
intention
as
submitted
in
the
contempt
proceeding.
secondly,
and
this
of
course,
gets
to
my
argument,
but
i’ll
address
myself
to
it
at
this
point.
we
are
talking
about
really
two
concepts
when
you
distinguish
between
a
restraining
order
and
a
preliminary
injunction.
in
a
restraining
order
situation,
generally
speaking,
you
wouldn’t
have
notice
or
opportunity
defend.
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
believe
that
that
did
exists
but
this
primary
distinction
between
a
preliminary
injunction,
and
a
temporary
restraining
order
has
noticed
an
opportunity
to
defend.
in
the
case
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order,
the
union
filed
the
notice.
in
fact,
i
had
an
order
short
in
time
for
the
hearing
on
that
particular
proceeding
and
an
essence
had
adequate
notice
by
its
ordered
mission
in
seeking
the
proceedings
and
obviously
had
the
opportunity
to
defend.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
the
choice
rest
entirely
with
the
union
as
to
which
argument
it
wish
to
present
on
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order.
now
i
could
have
raised
an
issue
as
to
the
merits.
it
could
have
controverted
the
factual
issues
but
it
did
not
do
so
and
chose
to
rely
exclusively
an
atkinson
versus
sinclair.
and
the
fact
that
it
chose
to
rely
on
a
narrow
tactical
approach
of
this,
did
not
deprive
of
the
opportunity
which
is
a
critical
point
i
believe
to
defend
on
whatever
point
it
felt
would
best
defeat
the
existence
of
the
restraining
order.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
in
this
case,
the
issue
that
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
vacating
the
contempt
judgment
was
the
fact
that
section
527
in
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure
apparently
imposed
some
sort
of
20-day
limitation
on
the
duration
of
state
court
orders.
now,
this
particular
section,
applies
only
to
orders
issued
without
notice
and
we
believe
that
there
was
adequate
notice
in
this
case
if
in
fact
the
court
had
reach
that
issue.
but
more
importantly
than
this,
the
law
in
california
is
that
where
you
have
proceedings
which
continue
the
order
in
effect.
and
they
take
into
account
such
things
as
merely
getting
a
continuance
on
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
in
fact
cases
which
are
cited
by
the
respondents
in
this
situation
rely
or
which
are
relied
upon
by
the
respondents
in
this
particular
case,
include
cases
where
the
court
specifically
note
that
you
can
continue
the
restraining
order
through
all
this
other
types
of
proceedings.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
it
would
have
continued
the
restraining
order
in
effect
and
the
domination
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
restraining
order
or
preliminary
injunction
would
be
a
relevant
for
contempt
purposes.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
if
the
union
had
taken
the
same
action
that
it
did
here
at
federal
court,
the
fact
that
that
motion
was
dissolved
i
believe
under
california
law,
it
would
have
the
effect
of
continuing
the
order
for
purposes
of
[voice
overlap]
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
that
would
automatically
have
converted
your
interim
restraint
into
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
believe
it
would,
your
honors.
and
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
the
point
that
you
raised
concerning
interpreting
state
law.
that’s
what
this
case
is
all
about.
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct,
it
would
require
federal
courts
and
all
of
the
50
jurisdictions
and
50
states
in
which
they
sought
to
go
into
a
wholesale
witch-hunt
to
determine
what
state
law
was
in
terms
of
restraining
orders
and
then
you
have
the
complex
ambiguities
which
are
present
in
this
case
resolving
and
conflicting
interpretations
which
might
exist,
despair
treatment
through
out
the
federal
judiciary
in
a
vast
ways
to
federal
time
involved
in
state
questions.
that’s
why
congress
when
it
enacted
section
1450
dealt
specifically
with
regard
to
the
duration
of
removed
orders
making
it
to
continue
in
effect
subject
only
to
dissolution
of
modification
to
avoid
this
wholesale
investigation
that
would
be
imposed
upon
the
federal
judiciary
in
cases
removed
from
state
court.
we
believe
that
the
particular
statute
in
this
case,
1450
is
clear
on
its
face.
it
talks
first
of
all
in
terms
of
all
injunctions.
it
is
not
restricted
to
injunctive
orders
which
have
no
duration
under
state
court.
secondly,
the
language
is
until
dissolve
or
modified
by
the
district
court.
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
this
restraining
order
was
set
for
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
correct.
that
is
an
essence
in
our
position,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
it
stands
from
--
excuse
me,
basic
concepts
of
congressional
legislation
and
that
being
that
the
right
to
remove
is
a
matter
of
legislative
raise.
and
the
union
in
this
case
assumed
the
benefits
as
well
as
the
burdens
of
the
statute.
the
benefit
it
thought
it
had
was
that
it
could
remove
the
state
court
to
a
forum
shopping
or
remove
the
federal
court
and
through
forum
shopping
obtain
the
benefits
of
atkinson
versus
sinclair
and
the
noble
matter
thrown
out.
the
burden
that
it
assumed
was
it
had
the
moving
obligation
to
go
into
court
and
seek
the
dissolution
or
modification
the
order.
and
until
it
did
so,
the
order
continued
in
effect
pursuant
to
section
1450.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
it
didn’t.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right,
your
honor
because
it
transferred
the
burden
of
proceeding
because
the
union
could
defend
it.
we
don’t
even
have
to
talk
about
it
in
a
labor
management
context.
the
defendant
is
the
only
person
that
can
remove
an
injunctive
proceeding
to
a
federal
court
because
a
complaint
for
injunctive
relief
would
be
directed
the
answer
to
defendant
and
only
the
defendant
has
a
right
under
the
act.
because
he
is
broken
up
to
process,
the
law
transfers
the
burden
from
the
plaintiff
to
the
defendant
to
bring
the
issue
before
the
court
because
the
plaintiff
would
have
brought
the
issue
before
the
court
under
his
original
order
has
been
deprived
of
that
because
the
action
of
the
defendant.
we
believe
that
with
regard
to
section
1450,
there
are
some
additional
factors
which
may
assist
the
court
in
its
interpretation.
in
this
regard
it’s
significant
to
note
that
there
are
attachment
provisions
in
section
1450
which
congress
specifically
makes
the
enforcement
subject
to
state
law.
it’s
obvious
in
drafting
1450
congress
had
its
command
the
language
to
make
a
state
court
order,
subject
to
state
law.
however,
it
did
not
do
so
with
regard
to
injunctives
and
retraining
orders.
the
only
conclusion
that
can
be
reached
is
not
making
it
referable
to
state
law
that
congress
intended
that
the
specific
language
of
1450
would
apply
under
the
restraining
order
would
continue
in
effect.
now,
just
to
add
some
emphasis
if
i
could
to
my
position,
that
this
would
involve
the
court
in
some
sort
of
wholesale
involvement
and
the
interpretation
of
state
law.
it’s
significant
to
note
that
there
at
least
three
major
arguments
that
could
be
made
in
a
support
of
the
position
that
527
did
not
cause
this
particular
order
to
dissolve.
first
of
all,
527
applies
only
to
orders
issued
without
notice.
in
this
case
definitely,
i
could
be
made
that
this
was
a
restraining
order
issue
with
notice.
additionally,
527
does
not
cause
an
order
to
expire
automatically.
if
there
is
some
act
of
continuance
in
this
case
we
believe
the
denial
to
motion
to
dissolve
was
an
essence
of
type
of
action
which
resolved
in
a
continuants.
and
more
importantly,
you
have
here
in
this
particular
situation,
a
15-day
statute.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
june
4th
order
it
was
17
days
after
the
issuance
of
the
modified
restraining
order.
and
the
judge
entered
into
some
sort
of
speculative
wishful
thinking
that
the
order
would
have
continued
in
effect
for
20
days
rather
than
15
days
and
it’s
in
fact
it
assumed
the
order
was
in
effect
on
june
4,
there
is
but
one
reason
that
it
could
have
been
in
effect
on
june
4
and
it
was
not
section
527
of
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure,
it
was
1450
which
we
rely
on
this
court.
we
also
believe
that
1450
must
take
precedence
over
the
federal
rules
and
several
procedure
more
particularly
rule
65
(b).
in
this
regard,
we
rely
on
28
u.s.c.
section
2071,
which
provides
that
the
rules
of
this
court
and
of
other
courts
must
be
consistent
with
acts
of
congress
to
the
extent
if
any,
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
rule
65
(b),
and
section
1450,
then
of
course
under
28
u.s.c.
2071
1450
would
prevail.
furthermore,
1450
is
specifically
directed
to
remove
orders.
rule
65
(b)
is
not.
it
is
resting
in
the
note
that
neither
the
legislative
history
of
rule
65
(b)
nor
the
legislative
history
of
1450
would
suggest
that
somehow
or
another
that
1450
was
in
any
respect
to
be
subservient
to
rule
65
(b).
and
furthermore,
even
if
65
(b)
did
apply
in
this
case,
it
applies
only
to
situations
where
there
is
an
order
issued
without
notice
and
as
we
indicated
previously
we
believe
that
there
was
efficient
notice
in
this
particular
case
to
dispense
any
of
the
time
limits
set
forth
in
65
(b).
in
summation,
we
believe
that
1450
should
prevail
over
state
laws
as
well
as
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
with
regard
to
the
duration
of
a
removed
state
court
restraining
order.
that
even
if
this
court
were
to
engage
in
analysis
of
the
state
law
or
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
65
(b),
that
the
order
would
have
still
continue
in
effect
and
the
contempt
proceedings
would
have
been
appropriate
at
the
time
they
occurred.
and
furthermore,
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order
was
tantamount
to
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction
for
purposes
of
continuing
the
injunction
effect
for
enforcement.
and
these
grounds,
jointly
and
alternatively,
we
submit
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
vacated
and
that
the
contempt
judgment
issued
by
the
district
court
should
be
reinstated
in
its
entirety.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
opportunity
to
defend
a
modified
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
case,
it
must
be
realized
that
this
was
an
amended
complaint
merely
to
include
an
additional
plaintiff.
there
had
been
a
prior
hearing
on
initial
temporary
restraining
order
and
which
according
to
my
affidavit
which
is
the
only
one
which
is
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case,
mr.
silbart
appeared
before
the
judge
and
argued
vigorously.
now,
there
is
also
within
my
affidavit
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
on
pages
52
and
53.
copies
of
the
documents
were
served
on
mr.
silbart
shortly
before
the
hearing
before
judge
locero.
both
mr.
silbart
and
i
were
present
at
this
hearing
and
mr.
silbart
presented
the
viewpoint
of
the
union.
and
that
there
was
breach
of
contract
and
that
the
court
should
not
grant
the
temporary
restraining
order
despite
argument
by
defendant’s
counsel
judge
locero
granted
the
temporary
restraining
order.
the
same
matter
is
contained
on
pages
50
and
51,
also,
one
of
my
affidavits
in
this
matter.
if
i
can
impress
the
court
of
one
thing,
i
wish
to
impress
it
of
this
fact.
we
do
not
believe
that
labor
injunctions
are
matters
which
are
easily
obtained
in
state
court.
there
are
very
rigorous
procedures
which
are
followed
because
very
basically,
the
san
francisco
bay
area
is
a
labor
area.
and
we
follow
these
rules
when
we
go
into
court
to
get
these
injunctive
orders,
and
when
the
attorney
for
the
union
comes
down
there
and
he
has
his
people
in
the
courtroom
before
he
goes
in
to
see
the
judge
and
he
says
there
are
strikers
and
there
are
in
strike.
he
goes
and
makes
the
best
arguments
that
he
can.
and
in
this
case,
he
contended
that
the
restraining
order,
excuse
me
--
that
the
contract
was
of
no
force
in
effect
and
therefore
was
not
being
breach
and
therefore
that
there
was
no
temporary
restraining
order
which
should
be
ordered.
under
the
circumstances,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
initial
complaint
and
initial
hearing,
then
an
amendment
of
the
complaint
just
to
add
an
additional
party
plaintiff
that
the
matter
was
discussed
with
the
counsel
for
the
union
in
advance
of
the
hearing,
that
the
court
in
fact
made
a
telephonic
communication
with
the
counsel
for
the
union
before
the
hearing
--
before
the
restraining
order
was
issued.
there
was
more
than
sufficient
time
to
be
familiar
not
only
with
the
moving
papers,
but
with
the
issues
which
were
involved
in
the
particular
situation.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
enforcement,
it
would
have
had
the
effect
of
preliminary
injunction
upon
the
denial
with
the
motion
to
dissolve
which
would
have
been
in
june
4,
1970.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
appellation
volunteers
cases
on
point,
i
believe
that
morning
telegraph
is
on
point.
in
fact,
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
a
restraining
order
is
tantamount
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
for
purposes
[voice
overlap]
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
and
i
wish
also
to
point
out,
that
this
has
been
considered
i
believe
by
the
appellate
courts
on
numerous
occasions
because
as
was
pointed
out
earlier
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
correct.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
in
those
particular
cases
felt
that
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
that
that
opportunity
was
given
to
the
defendant
to
raise
the
issues
which
were
in
defense
that
the
restraining
order
was
efficiently
particular
on
its
face
so
that
the
motion
denying
the
--
or
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
is
tantamount
to
the
reinstatement
of
the
restraining
order
was
a
preliminary
injunction.
now
in
these
cases,
one
additional
point
that
should
be
kept
in
mind,
with
regards
to
the
possibility
of
findings,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
there
was
no
answer
and
oppose
it
any
time
in
this
particular
case
even
up
through
the
situation
where
contempt
judgment
was
awarded.
so,
consequently
under
the
rule
8
(b)
of
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
all
allegations
or
complaints
are
admitted
including
those
factual
and
legal
conclusions.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
for
purposes
of
considering
the
complaint
as
a
setting
forth
-–excuse
me,
perhaps
i
should
state
it
this
way.
the
material
allegations
of
the
complaint
were
never
controverted.
and
the
issues
that
were
presented
in
terms
of
our
request
for
restraining
order
in
terms
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
and
the
issues
of
contempt
proceedings
are
very,
very
fundamental.
in
the
case
of
the
restraining
order
what
we
were
talking
about
was:
number
one
was
there
contract
in
effect
and
number
two
was
there
a
grievance
procedure,
and
number
three
was
there
a
strike?
when
we
got
to
the
motion
to
dissolve,
the
only
issue
which
the
union
chose
to
raise
was
whether
or
not,
atkinson
versus
sinclair
replied.
and
when
we
got
to
the
contempt
proceedings,
the
only
issue
was
whether
or
not,
there
was
in
fact
a
strike
occurring
at
that
particular
time.
now
all
of
these
things
were
totally
uncontroverted
particularly
at
the
contempt
stage
when
no
contrary
evidence
was
presented
or
whatsoever.
so
the
fundamental
factual
issues
were
always
undisputed.
it
was
a
legal
impact
to
be
given
to
those
particular
facts
which
was
this
positive
as
far
as
the
core
was
concerned
whether
or
not
a
restraining
order
should
be
issued
initially
whether
or
not
the
motion
to
dissolve
should
be
denied,
and
whether
or
not
a
contempt
judgment
should
be
entered.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
take
issue
with
that,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
under
1450
that
i
would
continue
to
have
a
restraining
order
if
it
continued
two
days
or
two
years.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
that
i
take
issue.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
mcdonald’s
case
which
is
cited
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
your
honor
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
i
take
issue
with
the
interpretation
that
there
is
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
527
is
in
existence,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
your
honor.
it
says
on
its
face,
15
days
and
20
days
but
the
courts
have
long
since
recognized
and
then
i
cite
the
mcdonald
versus
superior
court
case
which
is
in
our
brief,
that
whether
it’s
good
cause
it
may
be
continued
for
a
longer
period
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
and
in
this
particular
issue
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
you
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
no,
your
honor
in
the
mcdonald
versus
superior
court
case,
it
was
the
action
of
the
defendant
and
asking
for
continuance
on
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction
which
continued
that
outside
the
scope
of
527.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
precisely.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
our
fundamental
position.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that
is
a
position,
i
believe,
not
only
of
the
companies
in
this
case
but
if
congress
enacting
1450
because
the
removal
action
that
surely
breaks
up
the
state
court
proceedings
and
because
the
defendant
shows
to
remove
it
and
he
has
a
burden
of
proceeding
to
dissolve
it.
i
wish
to
raise
a
couple
additional
points
before
my
time
runs
out.
first
of
all,
in
the
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
respondents
contended
that
this
was
a
boys
market
case.
it
wasn’t
until
they
filed
the
brief
in
this
matter
before
this
court
that
they
raise
the
issue
that
this
might
not
be
a
boys
market
case.
the
issue
was
never
litigated
before
and
under
rule
41
(d)
and
(e)
of
the
supreme
court,
it
is
not
properly
before
the
court
at
this
time.
furthermore,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
if
it
were
to
analyze
boys
market
and
answer
implications
from
the
policy
standpoint
of
this
case,
but
let’s
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
a
301
suit,
that
was
removed
from
state
court
to
federal
court.
and
from
the
time
of
lincoln
mills,
the
time
of
boys
market
it's
always
been
recognized.
this
has
been
the
purpose
of
301
to
define
state
courts
of
jurisdiction
on
this
matter.
and
if
we
were
now
to
impose
those
la-guardia
standards
on
every
state
court
removed
injunctive
order
which
are
more
stringent
than
state
court,
it
would
have
a
natural
effect
of
disposing
a
state
court
jurisdiction
because
unions
would
in
every
case
will
move
the
matter
to
federal
court
where
they
could
have
more
stringent
procedure
rules
which
the
employer
or
the
companies
would
have
to
meet
when
they
sought
to
maintain
an
injunctive
or
a
restraining
order.
mr.
george
j.
tichy,
ii
that’s
right.
and
i
think
that
when
this
court
ruled
on
boys
market,
it
recognized
that
there
was
this
conflict
between
state
law
and
federal
law
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
boys
market
decision
overturn
atkinson
versus
sinclair.
we
believe
that
section
1450
is
in
fact
this
positive
in
this
particular
case
that
the
problems
that
we
have
had
to
go
through
here
today
analyzing
state
law
or
indicative
of
the
problems
of
the
entire
judiciary
would
have
to
go
through
with
every
removed
restraining
order
injunctive
order
case.
consequently,
we
believe
that
1450
should
prevail
over
state
laws
as
well
as
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
furthermore,
that
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order
was
tantamount
to
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
for
purposes
of
enforcement.
thank
you.
