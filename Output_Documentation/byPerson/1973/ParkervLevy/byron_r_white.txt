how
about
just
on
the
speech
side
mr.
solicitor
general,
how
much
would
the
military
lose
if
134
was
construed
or
held
or
redrafted
with
the
proviso
provided
this
will
never
apply
the
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
how
much
would
you
lose?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
to
then
draft,
do
the
best
you
could
in
drafting
some
kind
of
detailed,
or
a
little
bit
more
descriptive
statute
as
to
what
speech
was
proscribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
of
course
you
don?t
have
to
go
that
far
here,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don?t
have
to
--
why
do
you
have
to
meet
this
issue
the
way
that
you
are
talking
about?
if
it?s
so
true
as
you
say
it
is
that
this
conduct,
so
clearly
violated
with
this
core
conduct
within
134,
is
that
the
end
of
your
case
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
feel
you
have
to
meet
an
overbreadth
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you?ve
already
met
it,
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
must
conceive
though
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
think
the
things
you
did
in
the
average
case
that
there
would
be
a
lot
of
conduct
that
would
be
charged
under
134
that
would
be
held
not
to
be
covered
by
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you?ve
suggested
some
of
those
charges
weren?t
sustained.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they?re
nevertheless
there
are
some
that
you
could
never
imagine
to
be
coming
by
134.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
would
be
a
lot
of
conduct
that
you
would
say
is
a
[voice
overlap].
justice
byron
r.
white
more
than
anybody
would
suspect
was
coming
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
morgan,
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what
was
his
dermatological
training
that
he
had
and
secondly,
that
he
was
to
give
these
aide
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
period.
that?s
all
he
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
board
certified?
does
the
record
show
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
ever
practice
dermatology?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
his
supposed
training
of
these,
in
dermatology,
these
aide
people,
was
it
to
cure
people
or
the
opposite
as
i
think
you
have
just
inferred.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
just
examining
his
ethical
posture
which
you
told
me
about
the
dermatologist
being
in
effect,
syphilologist,
this
of
course
is
routine,
always
has
been.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
he
found
so
unethical
about
treating
natives
or
enlisted
people
or
officers
to
protect
themselves
against
venereal
disease
or
to
effect
cures
of
once
they
have
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
then
that
paramedical
people
are,
in
there
increasing
use
these
days
is
contrary
to
the
hippocratic
oath?
