mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal,
which
is
obviously
similar
in
many
respects
to
the
case
we?ve
just
heard
concerns
even
more
obviously
i
think
the
values
i
suggested
were
protected
by
article
134
and
here
article
133
as
well.
the
conduct
here
is
specially
egregious
and
i
think
it
is
impossible
for
anybody
to
say
that
the
appellee
here
could
not
have
known,
must
not
have
known
what
he
was
doing
was
prejudicial
to
good
order
and
discipline
was
not
the
standard
of
conduct
expected
of
an
officer
and
gentleman
and
indeed
of
course
he
was
also
convicted
under
article
90
for
the
direct
disobedience
of
the
lawful
order
of
the
superior
commissioned
officer.
upon
conviction,
captain
levy
was
sentenced
to
dismissal
from
the
service,
forfeiture
of
all
pay
and
allowances,
and
confinement
for
three
years
at
hard
labor.
now,
article
90
as
i
say
provides
for
the
punishment
of
anyone
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
who
willfully
disobeys
a
lawful
command
of
a
superior
commissioned
officer
and
the
specification
or
charge
levied
against
captain
levy
was
that
he
willfully
disobeyed
the
colonel?s
command
to
establish
and
operate
a
phase
two
training
program
for
special
forces
aide
men
in
dermatology.
and
the
evidence
showed
that
one
of
the
functions
of
the
hospital
to
which
he
was
assigned
which
was
fort
jackson,
south
carolina,
he
went
there
as
soon
as
he
was
taken
into
the
service,
was
to
train
special
forces
aide
men
where
men
capable
of
giving
certain
levels
of
medical
service
in
the
field.
captain
levy
was
the
chief
of
the
dermatology
service,
in
fact
he
was
the
only
trained
dermatologist
at
that
hospital
and
he
had
the
responsibility
to
conduct
this
training.
for
a
time
he
did
so
during
early
1966
and
then
he
did
so
with
increasing
irregularity
and
incompleteness.
reports
began
to
come
in
to
the
colonel,
colonel
francey
who
commanded
the
hospital
the
training
was
not
being
done
adequately.
he
investigated
and
discovered
that
captain
levy
had
by
now
totally
neglected
his
duties
in
training
aide
men.
he
called
colonel
levy
before
him
and
handed
him
a
written
order
to
conduct
the
training
required.
captain
levy
read
the
order,
announced
that
he
understood
it
but
further
announced
that
he
would
not
obey
it
because
there
is
medical
ethics.
he
was
told
that
obedience
was
nonetheless
expected,
he
persisted
in
his
refusal.
it
was
interesting
in
a
way
because
his
enlisted
subordinates
offered
to
carry
out
the
training
for
him
and
he
ordered
them
using
his
rank
as
a
captain,
not
to
conduct
the
training
of
these
special
forces
aide
men
and
threatened
them
with
punishment
if
they
disobeyed
his
order.
the
attorney
was
determined
that
nobody
was
going
to
receive
any
training
in
dermatology
in
that
hospital
and
he
used
his
rank
as
an
officer
to
carry
out
that
determination.
he
continued
to
persist
over
a
period
of
a
month
or
two
to
obey
that
order
and
ultimately
disciplinary
action
in
the
form
of
an
article
90
charge
was
levied
against
him.
now,
article
134,
as
we
just
heard
under
which
he
was
also
charged
prescribes,
among
other
things,
as
i
have
said,
all
disorders
and
neglects
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
in
the
armed
forces
and
all
conduct
and
nature
to
bring
discredit
upon
the
armed
forces.
the
specification
in
article
133
as
i
have
mentioned
as
the
--
provides
punishment
for
conduct
of
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman.
the
specification
under
134
is
set
forth
by
pages
8
and
9
of
our
brief
and
i
shall
merely
mention
some
of
the
statements
which
he
made
to
enlisted
men
under
his
command
and
to
others
apparently
coming
through
the
clinic.
the
statements
he
made
orally
contain
such
sentences
as,
?i
would
refuse
to
go
to
vietnam
if
ordered
to
do
so.
i
do
not
see
why
any
colored
soldier
would
go
to
vietnam.
they
should
refuse
to
go
to
vietnam
and
if
sent
should
refuse
to
fight.
if
i
were
a
colored
soldier
i
would
refuse
to
go
to
vietnam
and
if
i
were
a
colored
soldier
and
i
was
sent,
i
would
refuse
to
fight,?
and
then
he
referred
of
course
to
special
forces
personnel
as
liars,
thieves,
killers
of
peasants,
murderers
of
women
and
children
and
so
forth.
the
specification
under
article
133
is
much
the
same,
involves
the
same
allegations
of
the
same
kinds
of
remarks.
the
evidence
showed
that
during
1966,
while
he
was
on
duty
in
the
dermatology
clinic,
on
many
occasions,
captain
levy
made
remarks
of
this
nature.
he
engaged
in
conversations,
many
of
them
completely
one
sided
with
aide
men
undergoing
training
with
patients
and
visitors,
he
did
it
in
the
open,
in
the
presence
of
enlisted
men,
of
civilian
personnel
and
patients.
he
was
convicted
under
articles
90,
133
and
144
and
sentenced,
as
i
have
said,
he
exhausted
his
appeals
on
the
military.
ultimately,
after
much
litigation
he
warned
up
with
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania
which
denied
its
petition
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed,
holding
articles
133
and
134
unconstitutionally
vague.
it
also
held,
with
one
judge,
chief
judge
sykes
dissenting
that
the
possibility
of
prejudice,
under
article
90
for
the
direct
disobedience
of
a
lawful
order.
due
to
the
fact
that
trial
have
been
held
under
two
articles
held
unconstitutional,
required
that
the
article
90
charge
would
be
overturned
and
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
we
brought
this
case
here
on
appeal.
now
at
the
outset,
i
should
say
that
the
appellee?s
brief
raises
some
14
numbered
points
and
many
of
these
are,
i
supposed
offered
as
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
but
these
were
points
not
addressed
or
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
we
suggest
that
the
proper
way
to
handle
this
would
be
that
should
the
government
prevail,
on
its
arguments
on
133,
134
and
90,
that
the
proper
course
should
be
to
remand
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
consideration
of
all
these
other
points
which
it
did
not
consider
or
decide
and
a
decision
on
those
issues.
so
i
will
confine
myself
to
the
jurisdictional
objections
raised
here
and
to
the
argument
about
the
articles
themselves.
captain
levy
raises
two
jurisdictional
objections.
the
first
one
is
that
this
is
not
properly
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
under
28
united
states
code
section
1252.
i
don?t
--
we
have
explained
that
in
our
brief,
i
don?t
think
it
requires
extensive
argument
here.
the
court
noted
that
the
jurisdictional
question
was
reserved
and
noting
probable
jurisdiction.
1252
says
that
any
party
may
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
from
an
interlocutory
or
final
judgment
of
any
court
of
the
united
states,
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutionally
and
on
its
face.
it
provides
for
an
appeal
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
court
of
appeals
as
any
court.
an
act
of
congress
has
been
held
unconstitutionally.
the
reviser?s
notes
indicate
that
this
language
was
deliberately
chosen
to
allow
appeals
from
any
federal
court
decision
holding
an
act
of
congress
invalid.
in
addition
to
that,
we
rely
upon
the
fact
that
rule
44
of
the
federal
rules
of
a
public
procedure
prescribes
a
mechanism
for
notifying
the
attorney
general
constitutional
questions
arising
in
courts
of
appeals.
the
purpose
is
to
allow
the
attorney
general
to
intervene,
if
a
constitutional
question
about
a
federal
statute
is
raised
so
that
he
may
then
take
an
appeal
from
any
decision
against
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statute.
so
i
think
it?s
quite
clear
that
we
are
properly
here
on
an
appeal.
i
think
it
is
also
quite
clear
that
under
28
united
states
code
section
2103
that
if
we?re
not
properly
here
by
a
way
of
appeal,
this
should
be
treated
as
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
if
you
go
forward.
but
there
is
one
other
or
two
other
jurisdictional
points
raised
by
appellee.
the
first
one
is
that
a
government
attorney
filed
the
notice
of
appeal
in
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
that
government
attorney
was
not
an
attorney
of
record
in
this
case.
i
don?t
know
why
there?s
any
objection
to
the
filing
of
notice
of
appeal.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
in
the
middle
of
the
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
in
the
third,
in
the
eastern
district
and
the
department
of
justice
ordered
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
in
this
eastern
district
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
third
circuit.
he
was
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
government
and
i
cannot
understand
what
is
wrong
with
that
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
since
we
utterly
frivolous
objection.
the
other
objection
is
that
a
person
certifying
the
service
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
same
man
who
filed
it,
was
not
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court.
now
rule
10
of
this
court
says
that
these
appeals
are
to
be
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
rule
33
of
this
court.
that
we
did
as
to
the
manner
prescribed.
the
court
of
appeals
covering
the
person
who
must
certify
rules
will
seem
to
--
the
court
of
appeals
rules
cover
the
person
whom
was
certifies.
so
i
take
it
that
rule
33
is
questioned
as
to
persons
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
i
don?t
think
there?s
any
jurisdictional
question,
i
merely
discussed
it
because
when
it?s
raised
and
the
court
notes
that
it
wants
to
hear
about
it,
i
have
had
an
obligation
to
talk
about
it
unless
there
is
further
reason
to
discuss
it,
i
assume
to
passed
on
to
the
merits.
we
have
here
an
article
134
argument
which
is
much
the
same
as
the
argument
in
the
average
case,
and
i
like
to
read
the
page
just
like
part
of
that
quite
briefly.
as
mr.
justice
white
noted,
it
would
be
a
little
hard
to
attack
the
statute
facially
given
the
fact
that
as
to
certain
areas,
there
are
decided
cases
which
say
these
things
fall
within
134.
so
it
would
hard
to
strike
it
down
facially
on
those
grounds.
i
would
suggest
also
that
the
letter
carriers
case
and
broadrick
against
oklahoma
certainly
indicate
that
where
the
statute
applies
primarily
to
non-speech
activities,
facial
invalidation
may
not
be
called
for,
is
not
called
for.
finally,
not
only
our
vagueness
and
overbreadth
eliminated
by
the
fact
as
we?ve
already
considered,
now,
i
suggest
that
it
takes
less
than
30
days
when
one
enters
the
military
to
perceive
that
one
is
in
a
new
and
different
culture.
not
only
the
limiting
constructions,
the
contexts,
the
military
function,
all
of
which
is
obvious
to
anybody
in
it,
indeed
the
people
outside
it.
i
want
to
repeat
the
fact,
which
i
think
is
crucial
in
this
case,
and
that
is
it
would
be
impossible
to
write
a
detailed
code
of
conduct
under
134
or
the
article
133.
i
mentioned
in
the
speech
area
the
why
--
since
we
regulate
all
conduct
in
the
military,
unlike
the
civilian
world
which
is
possible
to
say
make
a
rifle
shot
statute
and
say
you
won?t
do
that.
we
regulate
all
conduct
in
the
military
world,
we
want
affirmative
action
out
of
the
military
in
the
way
we
are
doing
out
of
the
civilian
population.
the
military
has
a
defined
function,
it
has
a
goal.
civilian
society
has
no
single
goal.
for
that
reason
we
regulate
everything
towards
a
defined
goal,
the
goal
tells
us
what
conduct
violates
the
achievement
of
that
goal,
the
fact
that
everything
is
regulated
makes
it
impossible
to
write
a
detailed
code.
we
have
to
use
words,
which
men
have
common
understanding,
can
understand
when
they
realize
what
kind
of
a
society
they
are
living
in
and
what
its
object
is.
and
i
suggest
again,
there
are
many
areas
of
life,
other
than
the
military
where
we
have
found
it
either
impossible
or
not
desirable
to
write
a
code.
we
have,
as
i
say
i
suggest
the
sherman
act,
we
have
had
some
partial
attempts
to
codify
the
sherman
act,
and
they
either
turn
out
to
be
tumult
on
antitrust
law
which
is
--
does
not
guide
one
the
details
that
turned
out
to
be
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
those
codifications
in
themselves
turn
out
to
be
enormously
vague.
so
i
think
we
are
dealing
in
an
area
where
it
is
simply
impossible
to
write
the
detailed
code,
the
rifle
shot
series
of
statutes
that
we
would
cover
every
aspect
of
allowable
conduct
in
the
military.
that
being
true,
i
think
the
kind
of
articles
we
have
here
are
inevitable
and
desirable.
it
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
justice
white
i
think
in
that
case
the
military
would
immediately
have
to
draft.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
a
great
deal,
a
great
deal.
one
might
not
lose
much
in
a
conflict
like
world
war
ii
although
it
might
and
although
one
certainly
would
run
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i,
i
frankly,
i
have
tried
to
think
a
little
bit
about
what
kind
of
an
article
one
would
draft
and
i
frankly
think
it?s
impossible.
if
it
were
possible
for
strong,
legal
minds
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
tying
now
to
meet
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
to
meet
an
overbreadth
argument.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[laughter
attempt]
perhaps,
i
am
out
of
a
desire
to
point
out
that
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why,
how
it
can
be
met.
i
do
wish
to
suggest
that
if,
over
a
period
of
generations.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
don?t
think
that?s
very
common.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
some
of
them,
i
think
about
seven
of
the
total
were
not
sustained.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
that
list?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh
that
i
would
say
is
not
covered
by
134,
quite
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct,
that
is
quite
correct.
now
134
clearly
does
not
reach,
as
we
are
told
by
appellees
here,
any
conduct
the
military
does
not
like.
it
clearly
does
not
reach
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
clearly
also
is
not
a
catch
all.
134
expresses
the
rational
of
military
discipline
and
is
confined
to
that.
nothing
to
do
with
conduct,
somebody
may
not
like
or
a
catch
all
and
so
forth
but
i,
for
reasons
which
i
cannot
quite
articulate,
i
still
wish
to
express
a
point.
i
mean
i
can
articulate
the
psychology
that
impels
me
to
continue
to
try
to
distress
this
point
but
i
think
it
is
crucial
to
say
that
all
these
talk
about
oh
they
could
write
specific
articles
that
covered
all
these
things,
is
not
true.
if
this
court,
over
a
period
of
generations,
has
struggled
with
what
is
clear
and
present
danger
and
it
is
the
gravity
of
offense
discounted
by
its
improbability
and
so
forth
and
that
is
the
best
that
words
can
do
and
i
suspect
it
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
now
we
have
incitement
and
other
formulas
but
i
suggest
that
if
one
is
going
to
cover
much
conduct,
one
is
going
to
arrive
in
a
form
of
words
which
mean
something
to
a
man
of
common
understanding
about
which
you
can
play
semantic
games
with
and
if
you
take
it
completely
out
of
context,
completely
out
of
function
and
completely
out
of
history
it
was
used,
you
can
make
it
sound
vague.
i
think
this
was
being
done
here
with
134.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
article
133,
i
think
is
really
no
different
from
article
134
except
that
it
has
a
faintly
quaint
ring
to
it.
i
think
there?s
no
doubt
as
to
its
meaning.
it
applies
essentially
the
same
rational
as
does
article
134
but
i
suppose
it
stresses
the
fact
that
officers
are
held
to
a
higher
level
of
conduct
than
are
enlisted
men
and
properly
so.
this
article
refers
to
the
proper
standard
of
conduct
for
military
officers
and
that
too
is
not
defined
by
any
common
civilian
understanding
of
what
is
gentlemanly
conduct.
it
refers
to
the
conduct
expected
of
an
officer
because
of
its
military
function
and
because
misconduct
by
an
officer
is
much
more
damaging
to
the
military
than
individual
misconduct
by
enlisted
men
because
he
is
a
symbol
and
he
is
perceived
by
more
people
than
is
enlisted
men.
when
he
misbehaves,
a
great
many
of
people
see
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
appears
to
have
been
true
with
captain
levy,
mr.
justice
stewart.
he
was
a
very
unwilling
civilian
that
was
drafted.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
came
in
under
the
very
point
[voice
overlap].
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
had
his
induction
delayed
that
he
might
complete
his
medical
education
and
the
residency.
but
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
that?s
quite
true,
that?s
quite
true.
i
do
not
think
the
reluctance
of
some
enlisted
men
to
be
in
the
military
has
any
bearing
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
think
that?s
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
is
true,
that
may
stress
the
additional
need
for
article
134
rather
than
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
the
answer
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that?s
quite
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
has
come
pretty
far
from
its
roots
as
a
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that?s
quite
true
and
i
think
that
reflects
the
difference
between
the
british
and
american
experience
as
i
say,
the
wording
in
the
british
experience
probably
meant
that
you
would
be
cashiered
from
your
regiment,
regardless
of
its
regiment,
if
you
mentioned
the
lady?s
name
in
the
mess.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
it
comes
into
the
american
experience,
it
has
adopted
by
the
continental
congress
which
i
think
was
not
worried
about
cheating
a
polo
and
mentioning
a
lady?s
name
in
a
mess.
it
has
come
to
me
the
conduct,
the
standard
of
behavior
expected
of
an
officer
in
light
of
the
military
function
in
context
and
in
light
of
his
greater
duties.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
leadership
responsibilities.
and
i
think
that
has
different
historic
roots.
it
does
not
affect
the
fact
that
has
evolved
into
a
well
understood
standard
of
conduct
in
the
american
context.
some
of
these
statutes,
i
am
told
go
back
to
roman
times.
i
do
not
think
that
makes
them
less
valid.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
think
that?s
correct.
133
i
might
say
is
typically,
not
always
understand,
but
typically
charged
in
connection
with
another
article.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
doubt
that
in
the
ordinary
case,
mr.
justice
stewart
but
it
wasn?t
true
in
this
case
because
we
had
a
single
punishment
for
all
three.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
i
don?t
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
for
trial,
i
am
not
clear
that
there
has
to
be
a
single
punishment
awarded
that
they
could
not
divide
the
punishments
and
i
am
not
clear
about
that,
if
i
am
wrong,
they
had
a
single
punishment
for
all
charges.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
the
common
rule
as
we
say
it
in
our
brief
is
that
under
the
--
they
are
convicted
under
one
valid
charge
and
your
sentence
is
less
than
the
maximum
for
that
charge,
it
is
upheld
even
though
the
conviction
and
two
other
charges
is
overturned.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
--
the
due
problem.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
certainly
didn?t
intend
to
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
only
because
the
--
well,
you
don?t
have
to
necessarily
get
into
133
and
134
if
the
section
90
charge
is
upheld
and
the
only
challenge
to
adhere.
the
only
challenge
to,
i
am
sorry,
there
is
much,
there
are
many
challenges.
the
only
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
evidence
that
came
in
on
the
other
charges
might
have
prejudiced
this.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
then,
need
this
court
reach
the
134
and
133
charges?
no,
it
need
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
that?s
because
they
reviewed.
the
evidence
they
think
prejudice
of
nature.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that.
i
was
trying
to
--
i
was
suggesting
that
we?re
not
to
follow
that
rule.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you?ll
have
to
address
the
question
of
whether
that?s
right,
where
this
rule
can
be
applied.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
we
did.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that?s
right.
he
would
not
have.
if
he
had
held
the
article
90
conviction
in
the
clause
of
rule,
you
would
not
have
had
to
reach
134
and
133.
on
the
other
hand,
unless
there
is
a
jurisdictional
problem
with
the
average
case,
134
is
before
the
court
anyway,
i
will
quote
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
court
of
appeals,
if
one
sent
the
article
90
charge
back,
if
you
upheld
the
134
and
133
convictions,
nothing
would
happen.
in
fact,
that
goes
down.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
then
you
would
have
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
application
of
the
clause
of
rule
too
and
tell
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
if
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
application
of
the
clause
of
rule,
article
90
charged
would
have
to
get
back
for
retrial
in
a
court-martial.
if
you
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
clause
of
rule,
the
article
90
conviction
could
stand
by
itself.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
end
this
sentence,
end
this
sentence.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
quite
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
i
have
sufficiently
discussed
the
facial
invalidation
question
in
terms
of
letter
carriers
case,
the
impossibility
of
draft
in
a
code.
the
fact
that
133,
like
134
is
given
meaning
by
the
military
function
and
context
and
indeed,
here
captain
levy
was
warned
with
and
argued
with
concerning
his
behavior
and
part
of
the
133
charge
was
that
he
not
only
disobeyed
an
order
which
was
an
article
90
charge
but
went
back
for
the
enlisted
men
and
announced
to
them
he
had
disobeyed
an
order
and
would
not
obey
it,
which
was
a
133
charge.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal,
which
is
obviously
similar
in
many
respects
to
the
case
we?ve
just
heard
concerns
even
more
obviously
i
think
the
values
i
suggested
were
protected
by
article
134
and
here
article
133
as
well.
the
conduct
here
is
specially
egregious
and
i
think
it
is
impossible
for
anybody
to
say
that
the
appellee
here
could
not
have
known,
must
not
have
known
what
he
was
doing
was
prejudicial
to
good
order
and
discipline
was
not
the
standard
of
conduct
expected
of
an
officer
and
gentleman
and
indeed
of
course
he
was
also
convicted
under
article
90
for
the
direct
disobedience
of
the
lawful
order
of
the
superior
commissioned
officer.
upon
conviction,
captain
levy
was
sentenced
to
dismissal
from
the
service,
forfeiture
of
all
pay
and
allowances,
and
confinement
for
three
years
at
hard
labor.
now,
article
90
as
i
say
provides
for
the
punishment
of
anyone
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
who
willfully
disobeys
a
lawful
command
of
a
superior
commissioned
officer
and
the
specification
or
charge
levied
against
captain
levy
was
that
he
willfully
disobeyed
the
colonel?s
command
to
establish
and
operate
a
phase
two
training
program
for
special
forces
aide
men
in
dermatology.
and
the
evidence
showed
that
one
of
the
functions
of
the
hospital
to
which
he
was
assigned
which
was
fort
jackson,
south
carolina,
he
went
there
as
soon
as
he
was
taken
into
the
service,
was
to
train
special
forces
aide
men
where
men
capable
of
giving
certain
levels
of
medical
service
in
the
field.
captain
levy
was
the
chief
of
the
dermatology
service,
in
fact
he
was
the
only
trained
dermatologist
at
that
hospital
and
he
had
the
responsibility
to
conduct
this
training.
for
a
time
he
did
so
during
early
1966
and
then
he
did
so
with
increasing
irregularity
and
incompleteness.
reports
began
to
come
in
to
the
colonel,
colonel
francey
who
commanded
the
hospital
the
training
was
not
being
done
adequately.
he
investigated
and
discovered
that
captain
levy
had
by
now
totally
neglected
his
duties
in
training
aide
men.
he
called
colonel
levy
before
him
and
handed
him
a
written
order
to
conduct
the
training
required.
captain
levy
read
the
order,
announced
that
he
understood
it
but
further
announced
that
he
would
not
obey
it
because
there
is
medical
ethics.
he
was
told
that
obedience
was
nonetheless
expected,
he
persisted
in
his
refusal.
it
was
interesting
in
a
way
because
his
enlisted
subordinates
offered
to
carry
out
the
training
for
him
and
he
ordered
them
using
his
rank
as
a
captain,
not
to
conduct
the
training
of
these
special
forces
aide
men
and
threatened
them
with
punishment
if
they
disobeyed
his
order.
the
attorney
was
determined
that
nobody
was
going
to
receive
any
training
in
dermatology
in
that
hospital
and
he
used
his
rank
as
an
officer
to
carry
out
that
determination.
he
continued
to
persist
over
a
period
of
a
month
or
two
to
obey
that
order
and
ultimately
disciplinary
action
in
the
form
of
an
article
90
charge
was
levied
against
him.
now,
article
134,
as
we
just
heard
under
which
he
was
also
charged
prescribes,
among
other
things,
as
i
have
said,
all
disorders
and
neglects
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
in
the
armed
forces
and
all
conduct
and
nature
to
bring
discredit
upon
the
armed
forces.
the
specification
in
article
133
as
i
have
mentioned
as
the
--
provides
punishment
for
conduct
of
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman.
the
specification
under
134
is
set
forth
by
pages
8
and
9
of
our
brief
and
i
shall
merely
mention
some
of
the
statements
which
he
made
to
enlisted
men
under
his
command
and
to
others
apparently
coming
through
the
clinic.
the
statements
he
made
orally
contain
such
sentences
as,
?i
would
refuse
to
go
to
vietnam
if
ordered
to
do
so.
i
do
not
see
why
any
colored
soldier
would
go
to
vietnam.
they
should
refuse
to
go
to
vietnam
and
if
sent
should
refuse
to
fight.
if
i
were
a
colored
soldier
i
would
refuse
to
go
to
vietnam
and
if
i
were
a
colored
soldier
and
i
was
sent,
i
would
refuse
to
fight,?
and
then
he
referred
of
course
to
special
forces
personnel
as
liars,
thieves,
killers
of
peasants,
murderers
of
women
and
children
and
so
forth.
the
specification
under
article
133
is
much
the
same,
involves
the
same
allegations
of
the
same
kinds
of
remarks.
the
evidence
showed
that
during
1966,
while
he
was
on
duty
in
the
dermatology
clinic,
on
many
occasions,
captain
levy
made
remarks
of
this
nature.
he
engaged
in
conversations,
many
of
them
completely
one
sided
with
aide
men
undergoing
training
with
patients
and
visitors,
he
did
it
in
the
open,
in
the
presence
of
enlisted
men,
of
civilian
personnel
and
patients.
he
was
convicted
under
articles
90,
133
and
144
and
sentenced,
as
i
have
said,
he
exhausted
his
appeals
on
the
military.
ultimately,
after
much
litigation
he
warned
up
with
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania
which
denied
its
petition
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed,
holding
articles
133
and
134
unconstitutionally
vague.
it
also
held,
with
one
judge,
chief
judge
sykes
dissenting
that
the
possibility
of
prejudice,
under
article
90
for
the
direct
disobedience
of
a
lawful
order.
due
to
the
fact
that
trial
have
been
held
under
two
articles
held
unconstitutional,
required
that
the
article
90
charge
would
be
overturned
and
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
we
brought
this
case
here
on
appeal.
now
at
the
outset,
i
should
say
that
the
appellee?s
brief
raises
some
14
numbered
points
and
many
of
these
are,
i
supposed
offered
as
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
but
these
were
points
not
addressed
or
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
we
suggest
that
the
proper
way
to
handle
this
would
be
that
should
the
government
prevail,
on
its
arguments
on
133,
134
and
90,
that
the
proper
course
should
be
to
remand
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
consideration
of
all
these
other
points
which
it
did
not
consider
or
decide
and
a
decision
on
those
issues.
so
i
will
confine
myself
to
the
jurisdictional
objections
raised
here
and
to
the
argument
about
the
articles
themselves.
captain
levy
raises
two
jurisdictional
objections.
the
first
one
is
that
this
is
not
properly
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
under
28
united
states
code
section
1252.
i
don?t
--
we
have
explained
that
in
our
brief,
i
don?t
think
it
requires
extensive
argument
here.
the
court
noted
that
the
jurisdictional
question
was
reserved
and
noting
probable
jurisdiction.
1252
says
that
any
party
may
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
from
an
interlocutory
or
final
judgment
of
any
court
of
the
united
states,
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutionally
and
on
its
face.
it
provides
for
an
appeal
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
court
of
appeals
as
any
court.
an
act
of
congress
has
been
held
unconstitutionally.
the
reviser?s
notes
indicate
that
this
language
was
deliberately
chosen
to
allow
appeals
from
any
federal
court
decision
holding
an
act
of
congress
invalid.
in
addition
to
that,
we
rely
upon
the
fact
that
rule
44
of
the
federal
rules
of
a
public
procedure
prescribes
a
mechanism
for
notifying
the
attorney
general
constitutional
questions
arising
in
courts
of
appeals.
the
purpose
is
to
allow
the
attorney
general
to
intervene,
if
a
constitutional
question
about
a
federal
statute
is
raised
so
that
he
may
then
take
an
appeal
from
any
decision
against
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statute.
so
i
think
it?s
quite
clear
that
we
are
properly
here
on
an
appeal.
i
think
it
is
also
quite
clear
that
under
28
united
states
code
section
2103
that
if
we?re
not
properly
here
by
a
way
of
appeal,
this
should
be
treated
as
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
if
you
go
forward.
but
there
is
one
other
or
two
other
jurisdictional
points
raised
by
appellee.
the
first
one
is
that
a
government
attorney
filed
the
notice
of
appeal
in
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
that
government
attorney
was
not
an
attorney
of
record
in
this
case.
i
don?t
know
why
there?s
any
objection
to
the
filing
of
notice
of
appeal.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
in
the
middle
of
the
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
in
the
third,
in
the
eastern
district
and
the
department
of
justice
ordered
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
in
this
eastern
district
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
third
circuit.
he
was
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
government
and
i
cannot
understand
what
is
wrong
with
that
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
since
we
utterly
frivolous
objection.
the
other
objection
is
that
a
person
certifying
the
service
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
same
man
who
filed
it,
was
not
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court.
now
rule
10
of
this
court
says
that
these
appeals
are
to
be
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
rule
33
of
this
court.
that
we
did
as
to
the
manner
prescribed.
the
court
of
appeals
covering
the
person
who
must
certify
rules
will
seem
to
--
the
court
of
appeals
rules
cover
the
person
whom
was
certifies.
so
i
take
it
that
rule
33
is
questioned
as
to
persons
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
i
don?t
think
there?s
any
jurisdictional
question,
i
merely
discussed
it
because
when
it?s
raised
and
the
court
notes
that
it
wants
to
hear
about
it,
i
have
had
an
obligation
to
talk
about
it
unless
there
is
further
reason
to
discuss
it,
i
assume
to
passed
on
to
the
merits.
we
have
here
an
article
134
argument
which
is
much
the
same
as
the
argument
in
the
average
case,
and
i
like
to
read
the
page
just
like
part
of
that
quite
briefly.
as
mr.
justice
white
noted,
it
would
be
a
little
hard
to
attack
the
statute
facially
given
the
fact
that
as
to
certain
areas,
there
are
decided
cases
which
say
these
things
fall
within
134.
so
it
would
hard
to
strike
it
down
facially
on
those
grounds.
i
would
suggest
also
that
the
letter
carriers
case
and
broadrick
against
oklahoma
certainly
indicate
that
where
the
statute
applies
primarily
to
non-speech
activities,
facial
invalidation
may
not
be
called
for,
is
not
called
for.
finally,
not
only
our
vagueness
and
overbreadth
eliminated
by
the
fact
as
we?ve
already
considered,
now,
i
suggest
that
it
takes
less
than
30
days
when
one
enters
the
military
to
perceive
that
one
is
in
a
new
and
different
culture.
not
only
the
limiting
constructions,
the
contexts,
the
military
function,
all
of
which
is
obvious
to
anybody
in
it,
indeed
the
people
outside
it.
i
want
to
repeat
the
fact,
which
i
think
is
crucial
in
this
case,
and
that
is
it
would
be
impossible
to
write
a
detailed
code
of
conduct
under
134
or
the
article
133.
i
mentioned
in
the
speech
area
the
why
--
since
we
regulate
all
conduct
in
the
military,
unlike
the
civilian
world
which
is
possible
to
say
make
a
rifle
shot
statute
and
say
you
won?t
do
that.
we
regulate
all
conduct
in
the
military
world,
we
want
affirmative
action
out
of
the
military
in
the
way
we
are
doing
out
of
the
civilian
population.
the
military
has
a
defined
function,
it
has
a
goal.
civilian
society
has
no
single
goal.
for
that
reason
we
regulate
everything
towards
a
defined
goal,
the
goal
tells
us
what
conduct
violates
the
achievement
of
that
goal,
the
fact
that
everything
is
regulated
makes
it
impossible
to
write
a
detailed
code.
we
have
to
use
words,
which
men
have
common
understanding,
can
understand
when
they
realize
what
kind
of
a
society
they
are
living
in
and
what
its
object
is.
and
i
suggest
again,
there
are
many
areas
of
life,
other
than
the
military
where
we
have
found
it
either
impossible
or
not
desirable
to
write
a
code.
we
have,
as
i
say
i
suggest
the
sherman
act,
we
have
had
some
partial
attempts
to
codify
the
sherman
act,
and
they
either
turn
out
to
be
tumult
on
antitrust
law
which
is
--
does
not
guide
one
the
details
that
turned
out
to
be
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
those
codifications
in
themselves
turn
out
to
be
enormously
vague.
so
i
think
we
are
dealing
in
an
area
where
it
is
simply
impossible
to
write
the
detailed
code,
the
rifle
shot
series
of
statutes
that
we
would
cover
every
aspect
of
allowable
conduct
in
the
military.
that
being
true,
i
think
the
kind
of
articles
we
have
here
are
inevitable
and
desirable.
it
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
justice
white
i
think
in
that
case
the
military
would
immediately
have
to
draft.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
a
great
deal,
a
great
deal.
one
might
not
lose
much
in
a
conflict
like
world
war
ii
although
it
might
and
although
one
certainly
would
run
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i,
i
frankly,
i
have
tried
to
think
a
little
bit
about
what
kind
of
an
article
one
would
draft
and
i
frankly
think
it?s
impossible.
if
it
were
possible
for
strong,
legal
minds
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
tying
now
to
meet
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
to
meet
an
overbreadth
argument.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[laughter
attempt]
perhaps,
i
am
out
of
a
desire
to
point
out
that
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why,
how
it
can
be
met.
i
do
wish
to
suggest
that
if,
over
a
period
of
generations.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
don?t
think
that?s
very
common.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
some
of
them,
i
think
about
seven
of
the
total
were
not
sustained.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
that
list?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh
that
i
would
say
is
not
covered
by
134,
quite
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct,
that
is
quite
correct.
now
134
clearly
does
not
reach,
as
we
are
told
by
appellees
here,
any
conduct
the
military
does
not
like.
it
clearly
does
not
reach
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
clearly
also
is
not
a
catch
all.
134
expresses
the
rational
of
military
discipline
and
is
confined
to
that.
nothing
to
do
with
conduct,
somebody
may
not
like
or
a
catch
all
and
so
forth
but
i,
for
reasons
which
i
cannot
quite
articulate,
i
still
wish
to
express
a
point.
i
mean
i
can
articulate
the
psychology
that
impels
me
to
continue
to
try
to
distress
this
point
but
i
think
it
is
crucial
to
say
that
all
these
talk
about
oh
they
could
write
specific
articles
that
covered
all
these
things,
is
not
true.
if
this
court,
over
a
period
of
generations,
has
struggled
with
what
is
clear
and
present
danger
and
it
is
the
gravity
of
offense
discounted
by
its
improbability
and
so
forth
and
that
is
the
best
that
words
can
do
and
i
suspect
it
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
now
we
have
incitement
and
other
formulas
but
i
suggest
that
if
one
is
going
to
cover
much
conduct,
one
is
going
to
arrive
in
a
form
of
words
which
mean
something
to
a
man
of
common
understanding
about
which
you
can
play
semantic
games
with
and
if
you
take
it
completely
out
of
context,
completely
out
of
function
and
completely
out
of
history
it
was
used,
you
can
make
it
sound
vague.
i
think
this
was
being
done
here
with
134.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
article
133,
i
think
is
really
no
different
from
article
134
except
that
it
has
a
faintly
quaint
ring
to
it.
i
think
there?s
no
doubt
as
to
its
meaning.
it
applies
essentially
the
same
rational
as
does
article
134
but
i
suppose
it
stresses
the
fact
that
officers
are
held
to
a
higher
level
of
conduct
than
are
enlisted
men
and
properly
so.
this
article
refers
to
the
proper
standard
of
conduct
for
military
officers
and
that
too
is
not
defined
by
any
common
civilian
understanding
of
what
is
gentlemanly
conduct.
it
refers
to
the
conduct
expected
of
an
officer
because
of
its
military
function
and
because
misconduct
by
an
officer
is
much
more
damaging
to
the
military
than
individual
misconduct
by
enlisted
men
because
he
is
a
symbol
and
he
is
perceived
by
more
people
than
is
enlisted
men.
when
he
misbehaves,
a
great
many
of
people
see
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
appears
to
have
been
true
with
captain
levy,
mr.
justice
stewart.
he
was
a
very
unwilling
civilian
that
was
drafted.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
came
in
under
the
very
point
[voice
overlap].
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
had
his
induction
delayed
that
he
might
complete
his
medical
education
and
the
residency.
but
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
that?s
quite
true,
that?s
quite
true.
i
do
not
think
the
reluctance
of
some
enlisted
men
to
be
in
the
military
has
any
bearing
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
think
that?s
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
is
true,
that
may
stress
the
additional
need
for
article
134
rather
than
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
the
answer
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that?s
quite
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
has
come
pretty
far
from
its
roots
as
a
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that?s
quite
true
and
i
think
that
reflects
the
difference
between
the
british
and
american
experience
as
i
say,
the
wording
in
the
british
experience
probably
meant
that
you
would
be
cashiered
from
your
regiment,
regardless
of
its
regiment,
if
you
mentioned
the
lady?s
name
in
the
mess.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
it
comes
into
the
american
experience,
it
has
adopted
by
the
continental
congress
which
i
think
was
not
worried
about
cheating
a
polo
and
mentioning
a
lady?s
name
in
a
mess.
it
has
come
to
me
the
conduct,
the
standard
of
behavior
expected
of
an
officer
in
light
of
the
military
function
in
context
and
in
light
of
his
greater
duties.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
leadership
responsibilities.
and
i
think
that
has
different
historic
roots.
it
does
not
affect
the
fact
that
has
evolved
into
a
well
understood
standard
of
conduct
in
the
american
context.
some
of
these
statutes,
i
am
told
go
back
to
roman
times.
i
do
not
think
that
makes
them
less
valid.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
think
that?s
correct.
133
i
might
say
is
typically,
not
always
understand,
but
typically
charged
in
connection
with
another
article.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
doubt
that
in
the
ordinary
case,
mr.
justice
stewart
but
it
wasn?t
true
in
this
case
because
we
had
a
single
punishment
for
all
three.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
i
don?t
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
for
trial,
i
am
not
clear
that
there
has
to
be
a
single
punishment
awarded
that
they
could
not
divide
the
punishments
and
i
am
not
clear
about
that,
if
i
am
wrong,
they
had
a
single
punishment
for
all
charges.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
the
common
rule
as
we
say
it
in
our
brief
is
that
under
the
--
they
are
convicted
under
one
valid
charge
and
your
sentence
is
less
than
the
maximum
for
that
charge,
it
is
upheld
even
though
the
conviction
and
two
other
charges
is
overturned.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
--
the
due
problem.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
certainly
didn?t
intend
to
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
only
because
the
--
well,
you
don?t
have
to
necessarily
get
into
133
and
134
if
the
section
90
charge
is
upheld
and
the
only
challenge
to
adhere.
the
only
challenge
to,
i
am
sorry,
there
is
much,
there
are
many
challenges.
the
only
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
evidence
that
came
in
on
the
other
charges
might
have
prejudiced
this.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
then,
need
this
court
reach
the
134
and
133
charges?
no,
it
need
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
that?s
because
they
reviewed.
the
evidence
they
think
prejudice
of
nature.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that.
i
was
trying
to
--
i
was
suggesting
that
we?re
not
to
follow
that
rule.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you?ll
have
to
address
the
question
of
whether
that?s
right,
where
this
rule
can
be
applied.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
we
did.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that?s
right.
he
would
not
have.
if
he
had
held
the
article
90
conviction
in
the
clause
of
rule,
you
would
not
have
had
to
reach
134
and
133.
on
the
other
hand,
unless
there
is
a
jurisdictional
problem
with
the
average
case,
134
is
before
the
court
anyway,
i
will
quote
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
court
of
appeals,
if
one
sent
the
article
90
charge
back,
if
you
upheld
the
134
and
133
convictions,
nothing
would
happen.
in
fact,
that
goes
down.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
then
you
would
have
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
application
of
the
clause
of
rule
too
and
tell
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
if
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
application
of
the
clause
of
rule,
article
90
charged
would
have
to
get
back
for
retrial
in
a
court-martial.
if
you
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
clause
of
rule,
the
article
90
conviction
could
stand
by
itself.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
end
this
sentence,
end
this
sentence.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
quite
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
i
have
sufficiently
discussed
the
facial
invalidation
question
in
terms
of
letter
carriers
case,
the
impossibility
of
draft
in
a
code.
the
fact
that
133,
like
134
is
given
meaning
by
the
military
function
and
context
and
indeed,
here
captain
levy
was
warned
with
and
argued
with
concerning
his
behavior
and
part
of
the
133
charge
was
that
he
not
only
disobeyed
an
order
which
was
an
article
90
charge
but
went
back
for
the
enlisted
men
and
announced
to
them
he
had
disobeyed
an
order
and
would
not
obey
it,
which
was
a
133
charge.
