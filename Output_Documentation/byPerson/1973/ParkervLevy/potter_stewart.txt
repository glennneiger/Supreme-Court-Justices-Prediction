i
supposed
he
is
--
you
can
make
the
argument
that

be
valid
even

isn?t

as
against
the
argument
that

of

who
are
basically
unwilling

who?ve
been

that
would
not

be

he
was

justice

i

there
are

than
are

justice
potter
stewart
but
the
arguments
made,
that
these
are
basically
unwilling

we
are
talking
about
rather
than
professional
soldiers.
justice
potter
stewart
and
time
to
change
since
the
early
19th
century
when
the
lions
case
was
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
these
historic
roots
of
this
133,
i
will
go
back
to
the
british
articles
of
war
of
1765
which
provided
for
a
discharge
in
the
service
which
i
would
suppose
could
be
arguably
much
more
rational.
officers
do
presume
at
least
in
those
days
they
did
and
hopefully
they
still
do,
know
what
is
expected
out
of
them
as
officers
and
they
deviate
from
the
conduct
of
an
officer
and
a
gentleman,
they
should
no
longer
be
officers
but
that?s
quite
different
from
making
a
criminal
offense
which
is
now
is.
justice
potter
stewart
the
historic
roots
were
different
and
if
you
were
on
your,
even
if
you
cheated
that
polo
for
your
regimental
team
out
in
india,
it
might
be
conduct
unbecoming
of
an
officer
and
you
might
be
cashiered
out
of
the
regiment
as
an
officer.
justice
potter
stewart
but
to
make
that
sort
of
thing
a
criminal
offense
is
quite
a
--because
this
has
come
pretty
far
from
its
roots,
hasn?t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
criminal
offense
for
which
he
could
be
sent
to
prison.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
and
leadership
responsibilities.
justice
potter
stewart
better
or
worst
necessarily,
yes.
if
you
say
that
the
--
nowadays,
based
to
133
and
134
basically,
basically
the
same
except
that
133
is
applicable
exclusively
to
officers,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
133
is?
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
this
case,
you
say
article
90
and
article
133
and
134
and
i
think
i
heard
you
say
that
in
this
case,
at
least,
the
conduct,
how
it
thought
to
violate
article
133
was
the
same
conduct
that
was
thought
to
violate
article
134.
don?t
you
begin
getting
into
double
jeopardy
problems
when
you
make
two
offenses
out
of
one,
punish,
convict
somebody
for
twice,
for
one.
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
typically
do,
don?t
you,
in
the
military?
it?s
a
compulsory
joinder
i
think,
isn?t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
of
all
charges,
even
unrelated
ones,
isn?t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
therefore,
that
makes
it
even
worse,
you
can?t
tell,
can
you?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
sometimes
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
at
the
end
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
the
place
you
get
convictions
under
article
90
confirmed
are
reversed
as
in
the
court
of
military
appeals.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
giving
a
federal
district
court
very,
very
limited
jurisdiction
not
to
review
the
trial
errors
but
this
is
purely
a
jurisdictional
attack,
isn?t
it?
this
isn?t
a
matter
of
affirming
or
reversing
article
90
conviction,
that?s
the
function
of
the
court
of
military
appeals,
isn?t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
this
is
civil
action,
this
is
federal
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
good
deal
of
what?s
in
your
brief
i
suggest
is
just
not
open
to
a
federal
district
court
or
federal
court
of
appeals
under
the
system
of
military
justice
as
it?s
been
developed
in
this
country.
justice
potter
stewart
those
aren?t
three
cases.
those
are
two.
roe
against
wade
and
doe
against
bolton
are
the
abortion
case.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
not
and
the
abortion
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
as
my
brother
rehnquist
has
said,
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case,
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
brennan
have
joined.
the
court
today,
reversing
a
unanimous
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
upholds
the
constitutionality
of
the
two
so-called
general
articles
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
criminal
statutes
more
patently
unconstitutional
than
these
vague
and
uncertain
general
articles,
and
i
would,
accordingly,
affirm
the
judgment
before
us.
as
many
decisions
of
this
court
make
clear,
vague
statutes
suffer
from
at
least
two
fatal
constitutional
defects;
first,
by
failing
to
provide
fair
notice
of
precisely
what
acts
are
forbidden,
a
vague
statute
violates
the
first
essential
of
due
process
of
law.
no
one
may
be
required
at
peril
of
life,
liberty
or
property
to
speculate
as
to
the
meaning
of
criminal
statutes.
all
are
entitled
to
be
informed
as
to
what
the
state
commands
or
forbids.
words
which
are
vague
and
fluid
maybe
as
much
of
a
trap
for
the
innocent
as
the
ancient
laws
of
caligula.
secondly,
vague
statutes
offend
due
process
by
failing
to
provide
explicit
standards
for
those
who
enforce
them,
thus
allowing
discriminatory
and
arbitrary
enforcement.
it
is
plain
that
articles
133
and
134
are
vague
on
their
face;
indeed,
the
opinion
of
the
court
does
not
seriously
contend
to
the
contrary.
men
of
common
intelligence
including
judges
of
both
military
and
civil
courts,
must
necessarily
speculate
as
to
what
such
terms
as
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
and
conduct
of
a
nature
to
bring
discredit
upon
the
armed
forces
really
mean.
as
the
reports
of
military
courts
in
many
decided
cases
clearly
show
the
general
articles
are
in
practice
as
well
as
in
theory,
catch-alls,
designed
to
allow
prosecutions
for
practically
any
conduct
that
may
offend
the
sensibilities
of
a
military
commander.
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
a
line
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
beginning
with
the
case
of
dynes
against
hoover,
decided
in
1858
and
concluding
with
the
case
of
carter
against
mcclaughry,
decided
in
1902,
have
upheld
against
constitutional
attack
the
ancestors
of
today's
general
articles.
with
all
respect
for
the
principle
of
stare
decisis,
however,
i
believe
that
these
decisions
should
be
given
no
authoritative
force
in
view
of
what
is
manifestly
a
vastly
altered
historic
environment.
it
might
well
have
been
true
in
1858
or
even
in
1902
that
those
in
the
armed
services
knew,
through
a
combination
of
military
custom
and
instinct,
what
sorts
of
acts
fell
within
the
purview
of
the
general
articles.
throughout
much
of
this
country's
early
history,
the
standing
army
and
navy
numbered
in
the
hundreds.
the
cadre
was
small,
professional,
and
voluntary.
the
military
was
a
unique
society,
isolated
from
the
mainstream
of
civilian
life,
and
it
is
at
least
plausible
to
suppose
that
the
volunteer
in
that
era
understood
what
conduct
was
prohibited
by
the
general
articles.
it
is
obvious
that
the
army
into
which
dr.
levy
entered
was
far
different.
it
was
part
of
a
military
establishment
whose
members
numbered
in
the
millions,
a
large
percentage
of
whom
were
conscripts
or
draft-induced
volunteers,
with
no
prior
military
experience
and
little
expectation
of
remaining
beyond
their
initial
period
of
obligation.
levy
was
precisely
such
an
individual,
a
draft-induced
volunteer
whose
military
indoctrination
was
close
to
zero.
to
presume
that
he
and
others
like
him,
who
served
during
the
vietnam
era,
were
so
imbued
with
the
ancient
traditions
of
the
military
as
to
comprehend
the
arcane
meaning
of
the
general
articles
is
to
engage
in
an
act
of
judicial
fantasy.
in
today's
vastly
altered
historic
environment,
the
dynes
case
and
its
progeny
have
become
constitutional
anachronisms,
and
i
would
retire
them
from
active
service.
the
court
indicates
that
dr.
levy
should
at
least,
have
been
aware
that
his
conduct
was
violative
of
article
134,
since
one
of
the
specimen
charges
in
the
manual
relates
to
the
making
of
statements
"disloyal
to
the
united
states."
that
specification,
and
the
brief
reference
to
such
conduct
in
the
text
of
the
manual,
is
itself
so
vague
and
overbroad
as
to
have
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
at
least
one
federal
court.
but
even
if
a
consensus
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
"disloyal"
were
readily
attainable,
i
am
less
than
confident
that
dr.
levy's
attacks
upon
our
vietnam
policies
could
be
accurately
characterized
by
such
an
adjective.
however,
foreign
to
the
military
atmosphere
of
fort
jackson,
the
words
spoken
by
him
represented
a
viewpoint
shared
by
many
american
citizens.
whatever
the
accuracy
of
those
views,
i
would
be
loath
to
impute
disloyalty
to
those
who
honestly
held
them.
it
is,
of
course,
common
ground
that
the
military
is
a
specialized
community
governed
by
a
separate
discipline
from
that
of
the
civilian.
a
number
of
serviceman's
individual
rights
must
necessarily
be
subordinated
to
the
overriding
military
mission,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
military
may
constitutionally
prohibit
conduct
that
is
quite
permissible
in
civilian
life,
conduct
such
as
questioning
the
command
of
a
superior.
the
question
in
this
case,
however,
is
not
whether
the
military
may
adopt
substantive
rules
different
from
those
that
govern
civilian
society,
but
whether
the
serviceman
has
the
same
right
as
his
civilian
counterpart
to
be
informed
as
to
what
conduct
those
rules
forbid
before
he
can
be
criminally
punished
for
violating
them.
it
maybe
that
military
necessity
justifies
the
promulgation
of
substantive
rules
of
law
that
are
wholly
foreign
to
civilian
life,
but
i
fail
to
perceive
how
any
legitimate
military
goal
is
served
by
enshrouding
those
rules
in
language
so
vague
and
uncertain
as
to
be
incomprehensible
to
the
servicemen
who
are
to
be
governed
by
them.
indeed,
i
should
suppose
that
vague
laws,
with
their
serious
capacity
for
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement,
can
in
the
end
only
hamper
the
military's
objectives
of
high
morale
and
esprit
de
corps.
i
do
not,
for
one
moment,
denigrate
the
importance
of
our
inherited
tradition
that
the
commissioned
officers
of
our
military
forces
are
expected
to
be
men
of
honor,
nor
do
i
doubt
the
necessity
that
servicemen
generally
must
be
orderly
and
dutiful.
an
efficient
and
effective
military
organization
depends
in
large
part
upon
the
character
and
quality
of
its
personnel,
particularly
its
leadership.
the
internal
loyalty
and
mutual
reliance
indispensable
to
the
ultimate
effectiveness
of
any
military
organization
can
exist
only
among
people
who
can
be
counted
on
to
do
their
duty.
it
is,
therefore,
not
only
legitimate
but
essential
that
in
matters
of
promotion,
retention,
duty
assignment,
and
internal
discipline,
evaluations
must
repeatedly
be
made
of
a
serviceman's
basic
character
as
reflected
in
his
deportment,
whether
he
would
be
an
enlisted
man
or
a
commissioned
officer.
but
we
deal
here
with
criminal
statutes,
and
i
cannot
believe
that
such
meaningless
statutes
as
these
can
be
used
to
send
men
to
prison
under
a
constitution
that
promises
due
process
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
supposed
he
is
--
you
can
make
the
argument
that
this
may
be
valid
even
if
the
other
one
isn?t
because
as
against
the
argument
that

he
was

potter

potter

but
the
arguments
made,
that

are

are

and

will
go

of

the
two
so-called
general
articles
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
criminal
statutes
more
patently
unconstitutional
than
these
vague
and
uncertain
general
articles,
and
i
would,
accordingly,
affirm
the
judgment
before
us.
as
many
decisions
of
this
court
make
clear,
vague
statutes
suffer
from
at
least
two
fatal
constitutional
defects;
first,
by
failing
to
provide
fair
notice
of
precisely
what
acts
are
forbidden,
a
vague
statute
violates
the
first
essential
of
due
process
of
law.
no
one
may
be
required
at
peril
of
life,
liberty
or
property
to
speculate
as
to
the
meaning
of
criminal
statutes.
all
are
entitled
to
be
informed
as
to
what
the
state
commands
or
forbids.
words
which
are
vague
and
fluid
maybe
as
much
of
a
trap
for
the
innocent
as
the
ancient
laws
of
caligula.
secondly,
vague
statutes
offend
due
process
by
failing
to
provide
explicit
standards
for
those
who
enforce
them,
thus
allowing
discriminatory
and
arbitrary
enforcement.
it
is
plain
that
articles
133
and
134
are
vague
on
their
face;
indeed,
the
opinion
of
the
court
does
not
seriously
contend
to
the
contrary.
men
of
common
intelligence
including
judges
of
both
military
and
civil
courts,
must
necessarily
speculate
as
to
what
such
terms
as
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
and
conduct
of
a
nature
to
bring
discredit
upon
the
armed
forces
really
mean.
as
the
reports
of
military
courts
in
many
decided
cases
clearly
show
the
general
articles
are
in
practice
as
well
as
in
theory,
catch-alls,
designed
to
allow
prosecutions
for
practically
any
conduct
that
may
offend
the
sensibilities
of
a
military
commander.
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
a
line
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
beginning
with
the
case
of
dynes
against
hoover,
decided
in
1858
and
concluding
with
the
case
of
carter
against
mcclaughry,
decided
in
1902,
have
upheld
against
constitutional
attack
the
ancestors
of
today's
general
articles.
with
all
respect
for
the
principle
of
stare
decisis,
however,
i
believe
that
these
decisions
should
be
given
no
authoritative
force
in
view
of
what
is
manifestly
a
vastly
altered
historic
environment.
it
might
well
have
been
true
in
1858
or
even
in
1902
that
those
in
the
armed
services
knew,
through
a
combination
of
military
custom
and
instinct,
what
sorts
of
acts
fell
within
the
purview
of
the
general
articles.
throughout
much
of
this
country's
early
history,
the
standing
army
and
navy
numbered
in
the
hundreds.
the
cadre
was
small,
professional,
and
voluntary.
the
military
was
a
unique
society,
isolated
from
the
mainstream
of
civilian
life,
and
it
is
at
least
plausible
to
suppose
that
the
volunteer
in
that
era
understood
what
conduct
was
prohibited
by
the
general
articles.
it
is
obvious
that
the
army
into
which
dr.
levy
entered
was
far
different.
it
was
part
of
a
military
establishment
whose
members
numbered
in
the
millions,
a
large
percentage
of
whom
were
conscripts
or
draft-induced
volunteers,
with
no
prior
military
experience
and
little
expectation
of
remaining
beyond
their
initial
period
of
obligation.
levy
was
precisely
such
an
individual,
a
draft-induced
volunteer
whose
military
indoctrination
was
close
to
zero.
to
presume
that
he
and
others
like
him,
who
served
during
the
vietnam
era,
were
so
imbued
with
the
ancient
traditions
of
the
military
as
to
comprehend
the
arcane
meaning
of
the
general
articles
is
to
engage
in
an
act
of
judicial
fantasy.
in
today's
vastly
altered
historic
environment,
the
dynes
case
and
its
progeny
have
become
constitutional
anachronisms,
and
i
would
retire
them
from
active
service.
the
court
indicates
that
dr.
levy
should
at
least,
have
been
aware
that
his
conduct
was
violative
of
article
134,
since
one
of
the
specimen
charges
in
the
manual
relates
to
the
making
of
statements
"disloyal
to
the
united
states."
that
specification,
and
the
brief
reference
to
such
conduct
in
the
text
of
the
manual,
is
itself
so
vague
and
overbroad
as
to
have
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
at
least
one
federal
court.
but
even
if
a
consensus
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
"disloyal"
were
readily
attainable,
i
am
less
than
confident
that
dr.
levy's
attacks
upon
our
vietnam
policies
could
be
accurately
characterized
by
such
an
adjective.
however,
foreign
to
the
military
atmosphere
of
fort
jackson,
the
words
spoken
by
him
represented
a
viewpoint
shared
by
many
american
citizens.
whatever
the
accuracy
of
those
views,
i
would
be
loath
to
impute
disloyalty
to
those
who
honestly
held
them.
it
is,
of
course,
common
ground
that
the
military
is
a
specialized
community
governed
by
a
separate
discipline
from
that
of
the
civilian.
a
number
of
serviceman's
individual
rights
must
necessarily
be
subordinated
to
the
overriding
military
mission,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
military
may
constitutionally
prohibit
conduct
that
is
quite
permissible
in
civilian
life,
conduct
such
as
questioning
the
command
of
a
superior.
the
question
in
this
case,
however,
is
not
whether
the
military
may
adopt
substantive
rules
different
from
those
that
govern
civilian
society,
but
whether
the
serviceman
has
the
same
right
as
his
civilian
counterpart
to
be
informed
as
to
what
conduct
those
rules
forbid
before
he
can
be
criminally
punished
for
violating
them.
it
maybe
that
military
necessity
justifies
the
promulgation
of
substantive
rules
of
law
that
are
wholly
foreign
to
civilian
life,
but
i
fail
to
perceive
how
any
legitimate
military
goal
is
served
by
enshrouding
those
rules
in
language
so
vague
and
uncertain
as
to
be
incomprehensible
to
the
servicemen
who
are
to
be
governed
by
them.
indeed,
i
should
suppose
that
vague
laws,
with
their
serious
capacity
for
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement,
can
in
the
end
only
hamper
the
military's
objectives
of
high
morale
and
esprit
de
corps.
i
do
not,
for
one
moment,
denigrate
the
importance
of
our
inherited
tradition
that
the
commissioned
officers
of
our
military
forces
are
expected
to
be
men
of
honor,
nor
do
i
doubt
the
necessity
that
servicemen
generally
must
be
orderly
and
dutiful.
an
efficient
and
effective
military
organization
depends
in
large
part
upon
the
character
and
quality
of
its
personnel,
particularly
its
leadership.
the
internal
loyalty
and
mutual
reliance
indispensable
to
the
ultimate
effectiveness
of
any
military
organization
can
exist
only
among
people
who
can
be
counted
on
to
do
their
duty.
it
is,
therefore,
not
only
legitimate
but
essential
that
in
matters
of
promotion,
retention,
duty
assignment,
and
internal
discipline,
evaluations
must
repeatedly
be
made
of
a
serviceman's
basic
character
as
reflected
in
his
deportment,
whether
he
would
be
an
enlisted
man
or
a
commissioned
officer.
but
we
deal
here
with
criminal
statutes,
and
i
cannot
believe
that
such
meaningless
statutes
as
these
can
be
used
to
send
men
to
prison
under
a
constitution
that
promises
due
process
of
law.
