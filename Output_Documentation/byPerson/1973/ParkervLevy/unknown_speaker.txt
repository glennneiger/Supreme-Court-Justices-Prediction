we
finally
get

didn?t
we?
unknown

didn?t
we
get
rid
of
that?
unknown

(inaudible)
unknown

no,
he
--
unknown

he
reversed
the
--
he
would
not
follow
the
clause
of
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
what
i
am
asking,
if
we
do
sustain
the
90
conviction,
we
are
going
to
have
to
address
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
refusing
for
that
reason
not
to
reach
the
133
and
134.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
have
you
pleased
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
if
we
were
to
send
the
case
back
as
having
suggested
on
article
90
in
view
of
the
joinder
with
133
and
134,
would
it
be
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
reexamine
only
the
sentence?
in
other
words
these
three
charges
we?re
trying
to
gather
and
there
was
only
one
sentence.
as
i
understand
it,
the
briefing
in
this
case
that
there
really
isn?t
any
dispute
as
to
the
failure
to
obey
the
order.
so
if
there
have
been
a
trial
only
on
90,
certain
defenses
were
raised
but
they
did
not
go
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
order
was
disobeyed,
so
my
question
is
whether
if
it
where,
if
the
case
were
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
would
have
to
be
a
further
remand
to
the
court-martial
for
retrial
on
the
merits
or
whether
you
think
only
the
sentence
need
be
reexamined?
unknown
speaker
let?s
assume
we
disagree
with
the
government
on
133
and
134.
unknown
speaker
but
my,
my
difficulty
--
unknown
speaker
and
end
this
sentence.
unknown
speaker
well
my
difficulty,
mr.
solicitor
general
is
reading
me
a
brief
on
top
of
48.
i
do
not
see
that
you
addressed
the
closing
question.
we
submit,
however
that
even
if
133
and
134
were
held
on
constitution,
which
means
you
want
us
to
address
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
133
and
134.
my
suggestion
is
that
if
the
clause
of
rule
were
applicable
here
and
we
were
to
sustain
the
article
90
conviction,
we
do
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutionality
of
this.
unknown
speaker
but
we
will
have
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
thinking
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
it
could
exercise
its
discretion
to
refuse
to
apply
the
clause
of
rule.
unknown
speaker
where
did
he
have
his
residency?
unknown
speaker
we
finally
get
rid
of
that,
didn?t
we?
unknown
speaker
didn?t
we
get
rid
of
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
no,
he

unknown
speaker
he
