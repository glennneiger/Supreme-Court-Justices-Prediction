justice

brennan,
jr.
but
the
court
of
appeals
and
you
don?t,
as
i
have
reached
brief
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
do
not
quarrel
with
it.
i
held
here
that
they
would
not
apply
the
general
rule
if
anyone
of
the
charges
is
sustained,
then
it
is
irrelevant
that
the
other
two
may
be
upset
if
a
single
sentence
will
oppose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
wind
up
here
in
any
case,
peculiarity
is
associated
with
the
sentence
imposed
by
a
military
court,
render
this
case
appropriate
for
disgressionary
refusal
with
private
clause
and
general
sentence
rule,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
wondered
if
you?re
right
on
section
90,
then
why
do
we
have
to
get
in
to
133
or
134?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
let?s
assume
we
sustain
the
section
90
charges
independently.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that?s
what
you
say
that
you
needn?t
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
have
to
even
if
the
90
charge
was
good.
