you

justice

rehnquist
the
defense
that
the

requires
to
be
allowed.
justice
william

rehnquist
the
first
amendment
requires
that
he
would
be
permitted
to
present
his
objection
to
this
use
of
paramedics
before
the
court-martial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
appeelle
was
an
army
physician
with
the
rank
of
captain.
he
was
assigned
to
a
hospital
at
fort
jackson,
south
carolina.
in
1967,
he
was
convicted
by
a
general
court
martial
of
violations
of
articles
90,
133
and
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
his
article
90
conviction
was
for
willfully
disobeying
the
hospital
commandant's
order
to
establish
a
training
program
for
special
forces
aide
men.
his
convictions
under
133
and
134,
which
respectively
punished
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
and
all
disorders
and
neglects
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
in
the
armed
forces,
were
for
making
public
statements
which
urged
negro
enlisted
men
to
refuse
to
obey
orders
to
go
to
vietnam
and
which
referred
to
special
forces
personnel
as
liars,
thieves,
killers
of
peasants,
and
murderers
of
women
and
children.
after
exhausting
available
military
review,
he
sought
habeas
corpus
relief
from
the
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania.
he
claimed
among
other
things
that
both
articles
133
and
134
were
void
for
vagueness
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
overbroad
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
denied
relief,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed.
that
court
held
that
even
though
appellee's
own
conduct
fell
within
one
of
the
examples
of
article
134
violations
contained
in
the
manual
for
courts-martial,
appellee
had
standing
to
challenge
both
that
article
and
article
133
on
its
face.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
hold
that
both
articles
were
void
for
vagueness
and
that
a
new
trial
was
necessary
because
the
joint
consideration
of
the
charges
under
those
articles
with
the
article
90
charge
might
have
prejudiced
appellee's
right
to
a
fair
trial.
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
we
first
hold
that
articles
133
and
134
are
not
unconstitutionally
vague.
each
article
has
been
construed
by
military
authorities
to
limit
the
broad
reach
of
its
language
and
to
provide
examples
of
the
conduct
it
prohibits.
because
of
the
fact
there
is
differentiating
military
from
civilian
society,
congress
may
legislate
with
greater
breadth
and
flexibility
when
establishing
rules
governing
the
military
and
the
vagueness
standard
applicable
to
criminal
statutes
regulating
economic
affairs
applies
to
such
rules.
since
appellee
could
have
had
no
doubt
that
his
own
statements
violated
both
articles
133
and
134,
his
vagueness
challenge
must
fail.
we
also
hold
that
articles
133
and
134
are
not
overbroad.
the
necessity
for
obedience
and
consequently
for
discipline
in
the
military
makes
permissible
there,
what
would
not
be
permissible
in
the
civilian
contact.
there
is
a
wide
range
of
conduct
to
which
articles
133
and
134
maybe
applied
without
infringing
the
first
amendment,
because
appellee's
own
conduct
falls
clearly
within
that
range.
we
will
not
invalidate
either
article
133
or
article
134
at
his
behest
because
there
may
be
marginal
applications
of
them
which
would
infringe
first
amendment
values.
finally,
we
reject
appellee's
contention
that
his
article
90
conviction
should
be
invalidated
because
to
carry
out
the
hospital
commandant's
order
would
have
been
to
participate
in
a
war
crime
and
because
the
order
was
given
with
knowledge
that
it
would
be
disobeyed,
solely
to
increase
appellee's
punishment.
appelle's
remaining
contentions
which
were
not
passed
upon
by
the
third
circuit
should
be
addressed
in
the
first
instance
by
the
court
of
appeals
following
our
reversal
and
remand.

overbroad
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
denied
relief,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed.
that
court
held
that
even
though

own
conduct
fell
within
one
of
the
examples
of
article
134
violations
contained
in
the
manual

appellee
had

on

the

went
on
to

that
