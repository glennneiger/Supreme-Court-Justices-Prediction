mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
first
we
should
go
to
the
problem
that
developed
in
orloff
versus
willoughby
which
is,
the
government
noted
there,
the
supreme
court
did
that
the
parties
in
this
court
changed
their
position
as
nimbly
as
if
dancing
a
quad
drill.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
we
were
just
discussing
the
article
90
charge,
i
think
it?s
appropriate
to
go
to
the
record
in
the
case
where
the
prosecutors
state
in
the
record
that
the
order
charge
is
directly
related
to,
and
this
is
a
quote,
directly
related
to
and
intertwined
with
the
factual
basis
for
the
other
charges.
now
what
the
prosecutor
did
in
the
trial
was
to
take
the
additional
two
charges
we
had
that
were
dismissed
and
he
used
those
two
charges
plus
these
two
pure
speech
charges
and
use
those
charges
from
the
opening
statement
to
the
closing
argument
to
demonstrate
levy?s
opposition
to
the
war
which
went
to
the
question
of
intent
and
willfulness
on
the
disobedience
of
the
order.
it?s
so
limited
the
defense
in
the
presentation
of
its
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
considering
that
question
and
incidentally
all
questions
relating
to
the
order
charged
were
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
those
were
before
the
court
of
appeals
as
they
were
before
the
district
court
and
as
we
advised
the
solicitor
general
in
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm,
they
would
be
presented
by
us
because
they
are
implicit
in
his
request
that
the
conviction
under
article
90
be
affirmed.
now,
that's
first.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it?s
a
question
of
affirming
or
reversing
the
court
of
appeals
of
course.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
surely.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
suggest
that
it
not
only
is
but
it
necessarily
has
to
be
let
me
give
you
an
example,
under
the
order
charge
at
court-martial,
dr.
levy
contended
that
the
reason
he
could
not
obey
the
order
and
there?s
no
evidence
contrary
to
this,
absolutely
none.
the
colonel
said
that
levy
said,
?i
decline
the
order.
what
those
grounds
ethical?
and
levy,
a
physician,
this
is
not
a
fellow
just
standing
in
a
dermatology
clinic
at
fort
jackson,
south
carolina,
refusing
to
train
medical
person.
he
trained
everybody,
he
trained
doctors,
he
trained
all
medical
personnel
except
one
batch
and
they
were
combat
troops
and
he
said
he
had
an
ethical
right
not
to
train
them
and
the
law
officer
would
not
allow
that
as
a
defense
and
then
we
get
the
whelchel
v.
mcdonald
which
divest
them
of
jurisdiction.
and
beyond
that
levy
also
said,
he
says,
?i
will
not
train
special
forces
because
(a)
and
i
think
we
should
go
to
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton
and
the
abortion
cases
and
i
think
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that?s
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
abortion
cases,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
medical
ethics
because
it
appears
to
me
from
those
cases
that
no
one
can
be
ordered
for
instance,
even
though
abortions
are
now
legal
in
the
constitution.
no
one
can
be
ordered
to
perform
an
abortion
and
all
levy
says,
he
comes
into
the
army,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
under
the
doctor?s
draft,
all
doctors
are
drafted,
100%
of
them
most
in
the
united
states,
they
even
waive
at
this
time.
they
even
waive
physical
requirements.
he
has
no
previous
military
frame.
the
argument
and
the
brief
which
talk
about
previous
military
training
are
just
out
of
the
blue.
i
mean
he
doesn?t
have
any
in
the
record
clear
to
disclose
that.
he
comes
into
the
service
on
july
13,
as
i
recall
or
the
9,
he
gets
to
fort
jackson,
he
is
immediately
put
in
charge
of
the
dermatology
clinic
and
that
is
where
he
stays.
he
is
given
16
hours
of
military
training
at
the
outside
on
a
saturday
morning
and
during
that
period
of
time,
it
may
have
gone
to
26
hours.
he
almost
shoots
the
sergeant,
teaching
him
how
to
shoot
the
pistol
and
beyond
that
there
is
just
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
notice
or
anything
else
but
here?s
levy
in
the
dermatology
clinic
and
sent
to
him,
our
people
who
he
discovers
over
a
period
of
time
are,
as
he
states,
?killers
of
women
and
children,
murderers
of
peasants.?
now
when
he
looks
at
special
forces,
he
says
i
will
not
train
combat
troops.
(a)
they
are
combat
troops,
i
am
a
doctor
and
i
am
bound
by
an
oath
to
train
only
medical
personnel
and
he
says
(b),
they
are
using
medicine
for
political
and
military
purposes
and
it
is
undisputed.
because
the
colonel
who
set
up
the
program
said
that
is
exactly
what
they
are
doing,
he
thought
it
didn?t
work
good
than
bad
and
throughout
the
record
that?s
the
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
dermatological
training
that
he
had
was
that
he
had
completed
medical
school,
completed
his
residency
under
the
?berry
plan?
and
he
then
came
into
the
service.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
he
took
his
boards
i
think
approximately
a
year
after
he
got
into
the
service.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
he
board
certified
just
prior
to
the
time
or
around
the
time
of
the
order
on
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
privately?
not
prior
to
his
entry
into
the
service.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
his
purpose
was
to
train
people,
to
treat
people
and
what
was
he
to
train
them
to
treat?
problems
from
impetigo
to
gonorrhea,
syphilis,
the
bulk
of
the
work
in
the
clinic
related
to
venereal
disease.
there
were
17,500
patient
visits
a
year.
now
of
those
patient
visits,
most
of
them
are
the
largest
segment
related
to
venereal
disease.
in
that
group
of
patients
who
came,
there
were
two
categories,
service
and
non-service
dependents.
they
could
be
women,
others.
levy
objected
and
he
had
other
additional
medical
grounds,
number
one
physician-patient
privilege.
he
said,
?i
can?t
train
these
folks."
"i
can?t
train.?
he
couldn?t
train
the
people
without
the
aide
men
watching.
this
was
applicatory
training.
now
there
was
not
teaching,
in
the
ordinary
sense,
it
is
doctor?s
walking
through
with
special
forces
aide
men,
a
class
of
up
to
ten,
as
i
recalled
it
and
they
were
to
stand
and
stare
at
the
patients.
now
in
the
record,
i
mean
there
is
one
clearly
--
clear
place
where
another
physician
from
the
city
came
in
and
was
performing
the
training
when
levy
was
not
there
and
they
had
a
mrs.
helton,
and
mrs.
helton
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
but
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
right,
let
me
go
to
that.
first,
i
mentioned
mrs.
helton,
i
will
briefly
cover
that,
here
is
a
woman
patient
who
ten
people
are
suppose
to
watch
and
do
go
in
and
watch
troops
and
she
has
just
disturbed
to
death
and
everyone
asked
her
consent.
a
lot
of
levy's
patients
were
women.
the
second
thing
is
he
was
to
train
them
in
medical
usages
where
they
were
to
be
able
to
go
into
the
field
with
certain
kinds
of
diseases,
not
with
a
doctor
over
them.
no
medical
supervision
with
an
aide
team
and
special
forces.
they
were
to
go
out
and
carry
drugs
ranging
from
penicillin
to
chloromycin,
and
they
were
to
go
into
the
village
and
the
record
is
clear
on
this
as
sort
of
the
point
man
for
the
a
team.
their
job
was
not
to
give
the
a
team
itself
medical
care
primarily
but
to
give
it
to
the
civilians
who
they
recruited
and
the
civilian,
the
regular
defense
groups
of
up
to
1500
persons
and
they
were
to
provide
them
with
medical
care
but
this
was
the
on
tray
point
into
the
village.
what
did
they
not
do
ethically?
they
could
not
maintain
(a)
control
over
the
patients;
(b)
they
could
be
ordered
away
by
their
non-military,
by
non-medical
personnel;
(c)
they
had
complete
control
and
as
paramedics
did
not
work
subject
to
medical
supervision
in
the
field;
(d)
they
used
medicine,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
man
who
devised
the
program
himself,
they
used
the
medicine
as
the
on
tray
for
a
recruitment
technique
primarily
in
the
villages;
and
lastly,
it
was
undisputed
that
they
were
cross-trained,
each
of
them
and
were
primarily,
combat
soldiers
rather
than
medical
personnel.
now
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
nor
did
he
consider
a
violation
of
ethics
for
him
to
train
them
in
first
day.
all
people
he
said,
you
know,
that
there
was
no
question
about
that.
treat
as
a
physician,
yes.
train
in
first
aid,
yes,
but
this
was
more
advanced
medical
training.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
both,
he
knew
that
if
they
got
the
training,
that
they
did
not
work
on
their
medical
supervision,
there
was
some
statement
made
about
it
sporadically
trained
and
that
sort
of
thing.
this
is
a
learning
process
that
he
is
going
through
talking
with
special
forces
aide
men
amongst
others.
he
finally
comes
to
taking
these
positions
that
he
takes
orally,
never
on
a
public
speech
by
the
way
but
only
in
the
clinic.
and
as
he
did,
he
learned
what
they
did
and
what
they
were
doing
with
medicine
and
what
they
were
trained
to
do.
you
see,
unlike
dr.
levy
who
did
not
go
to
fort
sam,
houston
for
military
training
when
he
got
into
service,
special
forces
started
there,
then
the
aide
men
came
up
and
they
came
next
to
fort
jackson.
then
from
fort
jackson,
they
went
to
fort
bragg
where
finally
they
operated
on
a
dog
and
then
they
went
out
to
the
field.
and
dr.
levy
knew
all
that
by
the
time
he
disobeyed
the
order
and
he
knew
that
his
ethical
obligation
was
not
to
train,
other
than
medical
personnel
in
medicine.
that?s
combat
troops,
and
secondly
not
to
train
people
who
would
misuse
the
medicine
that
they
were
given,
they
use
it
for
political,
or
the
kinds
of
purposes
and
that
is
pretty
clear
that
that?s
an
ethical
concern.
the
problem
with
the
army
is
they
do
not
recognize
medical
ethics
including
the
privilege.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
hippocratic
oath?
i
think
we
set
it
forth
at
page
55
as
i
recall
in
my
brief,
i
am
just
trying
to
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
let
me
see
here.
yes,
page
55
and
on
56
we
set
up
the
specific
part.
?i
swear
that
according
to
my
ability
and
my
judgment
i
will
keep
this
stipulation.
if
i
preset
lecture
and
every
other
mode
of
instruction
i
will
--
acknowledge
of
the
art,
the
disciples
bound
by
stipulation
of,
according
to
the
law
of
medicine
but
to
no
others,
whatever
i
may
see
or
hear
in
the
lives
of
men
which
will
not
be
spoken
of
a
broad
eye
will
not
divulge
as
reckoning
all
that,
that
all
such
should
be
kept
secret.?
and
the
very
training,
the
nature
of
the
training
was
that
these
fellows
just
walked
into
the
clinic
and
stared
down
at
these
patients
and
watched
them
treat
patients
in
the
most
personal
situations.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
the
use
of
paramedical
people
is
fine
as
long
as
they
are
subject
to
medical
supervision
but
these
people
were
(a)
not
subject
to
medical
supervision
and
(b)
didn?t
use
paramedical
treatment
for
paramedical
purposes
as
even
a
primary
purpose.
they
use
it
for
a
combat.
the
military
are
glad
in
the
field
and
recruit
people
purpose.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
how
do
i
get
from
this
to
the
constitution?
i
do
it
easily
through
whelchel
v.
mcdonald
which
said
that
if
a
defense
is
not
allowed
and
that
case
it
was
an
insanity
defense
that
that
divest
the
court-martial
jurisdiction
on
that
basis
[voice
overlap]
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
the
first
amendment.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
present
his
ethical
concern
and
reason
for
declining
the
order.
now
first,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
he?s
brought
into
the
service,
after
orloff
versus
willoughby,
as
a
physician.
since
the
1800s,
physicians
can
only
be
brought
in
as
officers
in
(a)
since
orloff
v.
willoughby,
they
can
only
be
used
in
medical
capacities.
levy
cannot
be
ordered
to
take
a
gun,
shoot
and
do
those
kinds
of
things.
he
is
not
subject
to
that
kind
of
concern.
now
what
he
says
is
i
am
entitled
as
a
doctor
to
act
--
practice
as
a
doctor
and
i
am
protected
with
the
first
amendment
and
i
think
he
is
under
roe
and
under
doe.
i
think
we?re
getting
to
that
certainly
on
those
two
cases.
i
do
want
to
mention
that
dr.
levy
was
tried
and
convicted
as
you
well
know
for
conduct
unbecoming
of
an
officer
and
gentleman.
now,
there
is
no
clear
and
present
danger
there,
you
do
not
have
to
show
any
damage
there,
all
you
do
is
--
and
remember
these
are
pure
speech
charges,
the
conduct
charge,
the
order
charge
is
one
thing,
the
rest
of
the
charge
is
of
pure
speech,
he
is
not
doing
anything
but
talking,
just
talking.
and
where
is
he
talking,
he
is
talking
to
the
dermatology
clinic,
he
is
not
like
how
the
case
in
the
military
decided
after
this
that
said
a
man
can
be
prosecuted
under
133
for
carrying
a
sign
in
a
public
demonstration.
he
is
in
a
private
clinic.
there
are
utmost
13
people
who
have
heard
anyone
of
the
statements.
in
one
conversation
four
folks
heard
him.
now
he
is
in
private.
all
of
these
arguments
about
the
army
and
writing
statutes
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
that
would
be
fine
if
the
military
was
willing
to
give
up
what
it?
got.
and
what?s
it
got?
it?s
got
for
its
people
the
right
to
run
for
political
office.
now,
when
you
start
talking
about
statutes,
i
want
to
mention
two
things.
first,
if
it
is
too
difficult
to
write,
then
it
is
too
difficult
for
a
serviceman
to
understand
if
it
is
not
written.
and
the
second
thing
is,
that
army
regulation
600-20
paragraph
423
says
a
serviceman
?have
a
right
to
express
their
opinions
privately
and
informally
on
all
political
subjects
and
candidates
and
to
become
candidates
for
public
office.?
now
what
the
army
presently
has,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
you
were
asking
about
debating
societies.
it
looks
to
me
like
under
this
army
regulation
you
can
have
folks
in
the
same
company,
going
out
and
running
against
each
other.
now,
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
regulate
speech,
you
cannot
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
too
in
the
army
and
that
is
what
they
got
now.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
really,
it?s
that
is
only
a
part
of
it
and
of
course
that?s
a
medical
question,
as
far
as,
whether
it?
better
or
worse
like
if
you
gave
everybody
a
penicillin
shot
,
would
the
world
be
better
off
or
not
and
some
doctors
would
argue
either
way.
in
this
case
we
brought
forward
the
following
witnesses:
john
mayer
(ph),
dr.
saddap
(ph),
peter
bourne
of
the
walter
reed
institute
of
research
and
they
came
forward,
these
physicians
and
they
said
this
is
an
appropriate
ethical
concern.
they
said
we
recognize
this
and
physicians
who
were
in
the
army
said
if
they
had
levy?s
factual
knowledge
if
what
he
knew
was
true,
dr.
mauer
and
others,
they
would
not
give
training.
now
the
concern
was
just
not
to
how
this
treatment
came
on
the
field,
for
instance
dr.
bourne
came
to
a
different
conclusion
on
ethical
concerns.
he
thought
it
went
the
other
way
in
as
far
as
he
personally
was
concerned.
but
the
question
was,
may
the
physician
for
a
valid
ethical
concern
as
with
most
ethics,
is
it
right
or
wrong,
is
another
question.
and
levy?s
position
primarily
was
not
that
the
people
out
in
the
field
were
worst
off
or
better
off
with
medicine.
levy?s
position
was
that
they
were
military
personnel
using
medicine
for
military
and
political
purposes
and
that
(b)
would
never
know
whether
they
were
better
off
with
or
without
it
and
throughout
the
record
it
is
quite
interesting
to
go
back
and
see
what
special
forces
have
testified
about
the
quality
of
medical
care
out
there
in
the
field.
they
are
saying
they
go
in
and
they
use
words
like
panax,
witch
doctors
and
acupuncturists,
doctors
with
needles,
i
am
not
so
sure
those
folks,
myself
when
i
got
there,
were
better
off.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
as
to
whether
doctors
or
subordinate
officers
in
the
military
are
free.
yes,
there
is
no
question
that
you
can?t
to
that
to
a
chaplain,
there?s
no
question
that
there?s
an
attorney-client
privilege
in
the
military
but
there
is
no
physician-patient
privilege
recognized
and
doctors
are
different
and
the
nature
of
their
works
there.
now
i
want
to
mention
this
to
you,
as
far
as
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer,
a
gentleman
is
concerned.
there
was
a
case
in
1827
in
which
the
court-martial
decided
that
the
conduct
of
an
admiral,
the
first
jewish
commodore
rather
in
the
navy,
admiral
commodore
uriah
levy,
they
decided
then
that
the
conduct
of
a
dual
over
honor
was
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
but
not
that
of
a
gentleman.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
even
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
if
you
take
its
words
at
fair
meaning,
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
can
also
be
sometimes
itself.
conduct
becoming
a
gentleman.
and
that
the
statute
in
its
very
words
are
mutually
inconsistent
and
that
in
this
case
for
instance,
have
they
charged
dr.
levy?s
conduct
of
not
allowing
special
forces
to
walk
in
and
stare
at
his
woman-patients,
that
under
that
circumstance
lots
of
us
would
consider
the
conduct
would
have
been
appropriate
with
respect
to
a
gentleman
but
not
an
officer.
with
respect
to
134
and
133,
there
is
no
question
in
this
record
whether
dr.
levy
did
not
have
the
notice
that
the
appellant?s
case
is
based
on.
he
came
into
the
service,
he
did
not
get
the
training
other
army
doctors
get.
they
did
not
take
him
to
fort
sam
houston.
they
brought
him
in
and
they
put
him
in
the
clinic.
throughout
the
case,
there?s
no
--
there?s
not
an
iota
of
evidence
that
levy
knew
what
was
prohibited
or
what
wasn?t
prohibited
under
133
or
134.
now
beyond
that,
the
army
regulation
says
that
he
may
express
his
opinion
privately
and
informally
on
all
political
subjects
and
candidates
and
to
become
candidates
for
public
officers.
where
did
he
express
his
opinion?
he
did
it
in
his
office.
now
what
was
levy
doing
in
his
spare
time?
he
didn?t
join
the
officer?s
club,
that?s
in
the
record.
he
went
out
and
participated,
and
vote
a
registration
campaigns
in
civil
rights
work
in
civilian
clothes
off
post,
off
based.
and
we
have
been
attempting
a
civilian
counsel
with
a
clearance
for
top
secret
in
another
military
case
to
get
our
hands
on
the
very
g2-a
that
the
colonel
testified,
he
upgraded
the
charges
after
reading.
he
based
the
upgrading
of
charges
from
article
15
to
a
general
court-martial
after
he
read
the
g2-a.
they
gave
us
80
pages.
they
gave
our
military
counsel
180
pages
and
said
he
could
not
tell
me
what
was
in
it.
and
we
know
now
because
they
wrote
the
district
court
that
25
pages
came
from
non-army
sources
and
had
to
get
released
on
that
and
everything
down
the
line
but
the
very
charges
colonel
francey
testified
were
based
upon
the
g2-a
and
his
reading
of
it
and
he
upgraded
it
on
that
basis.
now,
this
--
with
respect
to
broadrick
and
with
respect
to
letter
carriers,
it
seems
to
me
that
levy
complies
completely
with
the
requirements
of
that
case
and
that
this
case
is
quite
appropriate
for
judgment.
in
broadrick
and
in
letter
carriers,
you
have
a
statute
which
goes
to
political
activity
and
in
effect
to
political
speech.
in
this
case,
you
have
a
statute
which
goes
to
everything
and
does
so
by
its
nature
and
because
that
is
what
the
service
wanted.
we
can
stand
up
here
and
talk
about
defining
and
doing
this
and
that
but
the
very
purpose
for
133
and
134
is,
to
catch
all
its
catch
22.
they
say
that
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
get
all
sorts
of
conduct.
to
talk
about
the
findings,
that
is
not
what
the
military
wants
with.
not
only
does
it
not
want
to
--
it
doesn?t
want
to
tell
you
about
political
speech,
it
wants
to
keep
its
political
speech
under
its
regulations
and
it
wants
to
keep
the
right
for
its
people
to
run
for
office.
now,
letter
carriers
didn?t
do
that,
broadrick
didn?t
do
that,
and
neither
of
those
two
cases
say
in
the
least
anything
which
in
any
way,
inhibits
the
right
of
dr.
levy
to
strike
down
these
two
statutes
on
behalf
of
himself,
not
on
behalf
of
some
conduct
for
someone
else.
now,
i
want
to
--
words
are
harsh,
dr.
levy
used.
not
so
harsh
in
retrospect
as
they
were
back
then.
he
was
on
overseas
at
a
military
post.
he
had
not
been
through
ever
basic
training.
he
was
at
fort
jackson,
south
carolina
in
a
dermatology
clinic.
he
didn?t
want
to
be
there
but
he
was
there
and
he
was
a
good
doctor,
the
records,
not
a
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
at
the
nyu
in
bellevue,
as
i
recall
it
or
downstate,
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
the
words
mean
but
it?s
in
new
york
city.
the
prosecutor
never
took
a
position,
we
all
noticed
at
the
trial.
if
you
will
go
to
page
2497
of
the
record,
the
prosecutor
says
of
course
the
government?s
position
is
like
any
law,
the
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
are
without
specific
notification
binding
on
any
individual
in
the
military
service.
it?s
only
when
we
get
here
that
the
quad
drills
stands.
now,
i
--
the
case
presents
many
questions
but
the
one
thing
that
the
case
does
not
present
is
a
doctor
who
refused
to
train
medical
personnel.
the
one
thing
that
the
case
does
not
present
is
a
circumstance
wherein
a
person
was
convicted,
wherein
a
person
was
convicted
for
anything
other
than
his
political
beliefs
and
beliefs
that
were
thrust
upon
him
and
charged
against
him
by
colonel
henry
franklin
francey.
i
have
an
extract
in
the
record
as
to
what
this
loyalty
means
and
what
this
affection
means
in
the
brief,
perhaps,
that
will
demonstrate
appropriately
that
tremendous
confusion
that
can
occur
with
the
use
of
words
that
nobody
knows
the
meaning
of.
but
i
know
the
meaning
of
a
three-year
sentence
which
he
received
and
the
meaning
of
that
sentence
was
that
these
officers
with
no
standard
for
judgment
and
a
prosecutor
with
no
standard
for
judgment
and
a
colonel
who
testified
on
the
basis
of
an
undisclosed-a,
he
was
charged
in
this
fellow
with
being
disloyal.
that
they
took
those
charges
and
catapulted
them
up
and
the
only
thing
that
was
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
or
a
gentleman
in
the
entire
case,
and
the
only
discredit
that
came
to
the
service
was
the
court-martial
process
in
the
fact
that
it
occurred.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
officer
who
testified
david
travis
at
that
time
perhaps
the
most
decorated
american
in
vietnam
combat
soldier,
who
said,
?sure
i
have
been
at
fort
jackson,?
and
he
was
black
?and
i?ve
been
with
dr.
levy
and
he?s
talked
to
me
and
i?ve
disagreed
with
him.?
but
he
says,
?that?s
what
i
am
in
vietnam
fighting
for.?
his
free
expression
then
i
asked
him,
?and
where
do
you
go
from
here??
and
he
said,
?back
to
vietnam.?
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
really
what
this
case
is
all
about.
it?s
the
right
of
a
person
to
express
themselves
freely,
in
private,
to
practice
medicine,
and
to
give
the
military
their
very
best
even
if
they
don?t
want
to
and
maybe
those
problems
will
go
away,
now
that
we?ve
come
to
the
position
that
we
do
not
have
a
drafted
military
service,
but
a
voluntary
military
service.
and
perhaps,
i
don?t
know
that
will
result
in
some
military
men
when
they
are
entering
the
service,
giving
up
some
of
those
rights
of
civilians.
if
it
does
and
they
are
going
to
write
a
statute,
they
better
get
away
from
saying
military
men
can
run
for
office
and
discuss
privately
any
political
matters
that
come
to
their
minds.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
first
we
should
go
to
the
problem
that
developed
in
orloff
versus
willoughby
which
is,
the
government
noted
there,
the
supreme
court
did
that
the
parties
in
this
court
changed
their
position
as
nimbly
as
if
dancing
a
quad
drill.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
we
were
just
discussing
the
article
90
charge,
i
think
it?s
appropriate
to
go
to
the
record
in
the
case
where
the
prosecutors
state
in
the
record
that
the
order
charge
is
directly
related
to,
and
this
is
a
quote,
directly
related
to
and
intertwined
with
the
factual
basis
for
the
other
charges.
now
what
the
prosecutor
did
in
the
trial
was
to
take
the
additional
two
charges
we
had
that
were
dismissed
and
he
used
those
two
charges
plus
these
two
pure
speech
charges
and
use
those
charges
from
the
opening
statement
to
the
closing
argument
to
demonstrate
levy?s
opposition
to
the
war
which
went
to
the
question
of
intent
and
willfulness
on
the
disobedience
of
the
order.
it?s
so
limited
the
defense
in
the
presentation
of
its
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
considering
that
question
and
incidentally
all
questions
relating
to
the
order
charged
were
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
those
were
before
the
court
of
appeals
as
they
were
before
the
district
court
and
as
we
advised
the
solicitor
general
in
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm,
they
would
be
presented
by
us
because
they
are
implicit
in
his
request
that
the
conviction
under
article
90
be
affirmed.
now,
that's
first.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it?s
a
question
of
affirming
or
reversing
the
court
of
appeals
of
course.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
surely.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
suggest
that
it
not
only
is
but
it
necessarily
has
to
be
let
me
give
you
an
example,
under
the
order
charge
at
court-martial,
dr.
levy
contended
that
the
reason
he
could
not
obey
the
order
and
there?s
no
evidence
contrary
to
this,
absolutely
none.
the
colonel
said
that
levy
said,
?i
decline
the
order.
what
those
grounds
ethical?
and
levy,
a
physician,
this
is
not
a
fellow
just
standing
in
a
dermatology
clinic
at
fort
jackson,
south
carolina,
refusing
to
train
medical
person.
he
trained
everybody,
he
trained
doctors,
he
trained
all
medical
personnel
except
one
batch
and
they
were
combat
troops
and
he
said
he
had
an
ethical
right
not
to
train
them
and
the
law
officer
would
not
allow
that
as
a
defense
and
then
we
get
the
whelchel
v.
mcdonald
which
divest
them
of
jurisdiction.
and
beyond
that
levy
also
said,
he
says,
?i
will
not
train
special
forces
because
(a)
and
i
think
we
should
go
to
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton
and
the
abortion
cases
and
i
think
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that?s
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
abortion
cases,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
medical
ethics
because
it
appears
to
me
from
those
cases
that
no
one
can
be
ordered
for
instance,
even
though
abortions
are
now
legal
in
the
constitution.
no
one
can
be
ordered
to
perform
an
abortion
and
all
levy
says,
he
comes
into
the
army,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
under
the
doctor?s
draft,
all
doctors
are
drafted,
100%
of
them
most
in
the
united
states,
they
even
waive
at
this
time.
they
even
waive
physical
requirements.
he
has
no
previous
military
frame.
the
argument
and
the
brief
which
talk
about
previous
military
training
are
just
out
of
the
blue.
i
mean
he
doesn?t
have
any
in
the
record
clear
to
disclose
that.
he
comes
into
the
service
on
july
13,
as
i
recall
or
the
9,
he
gets
to
fort
jackson,
he
is
immediately
put
in
charge
of
the
dermatology
clinic
and
that
is
where
he
stays.
he
is
given
16
hours
of
military
training
at
the
outside
on
a
saturday
morning
and
during
that
period
of
time,
it
may
have
gone
to
26
hours.
he
almost
shoots
the
sergeant,
teaching
him
how
to
shoot
the
pistol
and
beyond
that
there
is
just
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
notice
or
anything
else
but
here?s
levy
in
the
dermatology
clinic
and
sent
to
him,
our
people
who
he
discovers
over
a
period
of
time
are,
as
he
states,
?killers
of
women
and
children,
murderers
of
peasants.?
now
when
he
looks
at
special
forces,
he
says
i
will
not
train
combat
troops.
(a)
they
are
combat
troops,
i
am
a
doctor
and
i
am
bound
by
an
oath
to
train
only
medical
personnel
and
he
says
(b),
they
are
using
medicine
for
political
and
military
purposes
and
it
is
undisputed.
because
the
colonel
who
set
up
the
program
said
that
is
exactly
what
they
are
doing,
he
thought
it
didn?t
work
good
than
bad
and
throughout
the
record
that?s
the
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
dermatological
training
that
he
had
was
that
he
had
completed
medical
school,
completed
his
residency
under
the
?berry
plan?
and
he
then
came
into
the
service.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
he
took
his
boards
i
think
approximately
a
year
after
he
got
into
the
service.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
he
board
certified
just
prior
to
the
time
or
around
the
time
of
the
order
on
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
privately?
not
prior
to
his
entry
into
the
service.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
his
purpose
was
to
train
people,
to
treat
people
and
what
was
he
to
train
them
to
treat?
problems
from
impetigo
to
gonorrhea,
syphilis,
the
bulk
of
the
work
in
the
clinic
related
to
venereal
disease.
there
were
17,500
patient
visits
a
year.
now
of
those
patient
visits,
most
of
them
are
the
largest
segment
related
to
venereal
disease.
in
that
group
of
patients
who
came,
there
were
two
categories,
service
and
non-service
dependents.
they
could
be
women,
others.
levy
objected
and
he
had
other
additional
medical
grounds,
number
one
physician-patient
privilege.
he
said,
?i
can?t
train
these
folks."
"i
can?t
train.?
he
couldn?t
train
the
people
without
the
aide
men
watching.
this
was
applicatory
training.
now
there
was
not
teaching,
in
the
ordinary
sense,
it
is
doctor?s
walking
through
with
special
forces
aide
men,
a
class
of
up
to
ten,
as
i
recalled
it
and
they
were
to
stand
and
stare
at
the
patients.
now
in
the
record,
i
mean
there
is
one
clearly
--
clear
place
where
another
physician
from
the
city
came
in
and
was
performing
the
training
when
levy
was
not
there
and
they
had
a
mrs.
helton,
and
mrs.
helton
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
but
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
right,
let
me
go
to
that.
first,
i
mentioned
mrs.
helton,
i
will
briefly
cover
that,
here
is
a
woman
patient
who
ten
people
are
suppose
to
watch
and
do
go
in
and
watch
troops
and
she
has
just
disturbed
to
death
and
everyone
asked
her
consent.
a
lot
of
levy's
patients
were
women.
the
second
thing
is
he
was
to
train
them
in
medical
usages
where
they
were
to
be
able
to
go
into
the
field
with
certain
kinds
of
diseases,
not
with
a
doctor
over
them.
no
medical
supervision
with
an
aide
team
and
special
forces.
they
were
to
go
out
and
carry
drugs
ranging
from
penicillin
to
chloromycin,
and
they
were
to
go
into
the
village
and
the
record
is
clear
on
this
as
sort
of
the
point
man
for
the
a
team.
their
job
was
not
to
give
the
a
team
itself
medical
care
primarily
but
to
give
it
to
the
civilians
who
they
recruited
and
the
civilian,
the
regular
defense
groups
of
up
to
1500
persons
and
they
were
to
provide
them
with
medical
care
but
this
was
the
on
tray
point
into
the
village.
what
did
they
not
do
ethically?
they
could
not
maintain
(a)
control
over
the
patients;
(b)
they
could
be
ordered
away
by
their
non-military,
by
non-medical
personnel;
(c)
they
had
complete
control
and
as
paramedics
did
not
work
subject
to
medical
supervision
in
the
field;
(d)
they
used
medicine,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
man
who
devised
the
program
himself,
they
used
the
medicine
as
the
on
tray
for
a
recruitment
technique
primarily
in
the
villages;
and
lastly,
it
was
undisputed
that
they
were
cross-trained,
each
of
them
and
were
primarily,
combat
soldiers
rather
than
medical
personnel.
now
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
nor
did
he
consider
a
violation
of
ethics
for
him
to
train
them
in
first
day.
all
people
he
said,
you
know,
that
there
was
no
question
about
that.
treat
as
a
physician,
yes.
train
in
first
aid,
yes,
but
this
was
more
advanced
medical
training.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
both,
he
knew
that
if
they
got
the
training,
that
they
did
not
work
on
their
medical
supervision,
there
was
some
statement
made
about
it
sporadically
trained
and
that
sort
of
thing.
this
is
a
learning
process
that
he
is
going
through
talking
with
special
forces
aide
men
amongst
others.
he
finally
comes
to
taking
these
positions
that
he
takes
orally,
never
on
a
public
speech
by
the
way
but
only
in
the
clinic.
and
as
he
did,
he
learned
what
they
did
and
what
they
were
doing
with
medicine
and
what
they
were
trained
to
do.
you
see,
unlike
dr.
levy
who
did
not
go
to
fort
sam,
houston
for
military
training
when
he
got
into
service,
special
forces
started
there,
then
the
aide
men
came
up
and
they
came
next
to
fort
jackson.
then
from
fort
jackson,
they
went
to
fort
bragg
where
finally
they
operated
on
a
dog
and
then
they
went
out
to
the
field.
and
dr.
levy
knew
all
that
by
the
time
he
disobeyed
the
order
and
he
knew
that
his
ethical
obligation
was
not
to
train,
other
than
medical
personnel
in
medicine.
that?s
combat
troops,
and
secondly
not
to
train
people
who
would
misuse
the
medicine
that
they
were
given,
they
use
it
for
political,
or
the
kinds
of
purposes
and
that
is
pretty
clear
that
that?s
an
ethical
concern.
the
problem
with
the
army
is
they
do
not
recognize
medical
ethics
including
the
privilege.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
hippocratic
oath?
i
think
we
set
it
forth
at
page
55
as
i
recall
in
my
brief,
i
am
just
trying
to
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
let
me
see
here.
yes,
page
55
and
on
56
we
set
up
the
specific
part.
?i
swear
that
according
to
my
ability
and
my
judgment
i
will
keep
this
stipulation.
if
i
preset
lecture
and
every
other
mode
of
instruction
i
will
--
acknowledge
of
the
art,
the
disciples
bound
by
stipulation
of,
according
to
the
law
of
medicine
but
to
no
others,
whatever
i
may
see
or
hear
in
the
lives
of
men
which
will
not
be
spoken
of
a
broad
eye
will
not
divulge
as
reckoning
all
that,
that
all
such
should
be
kept
secret.?
and
the
very
training,
the
nature
of
the
training
was
that
these
fellows
just
walked
into
the
clinic
and
stared
down
at
these
patients
and
watched
them
treat
patients
in
the
most
personal
situations.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
the
use
of
paramedical
people
is
fine
as
long
as
they
are
subject
to
medical
supervision
but
these
people
were
(a)
not
subject
to
medical
supervision
and
(b)
didn?t
use
paramedical
treatment
for
paramedical
purposes
as
even
a
primary
purpose.
they
use
it
for
a
combat.
the
military
are
glad
in
the
field
and
recruit
people
purpose.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
how
do
i
get
from
this
to
the
constitution?
i
do
it
easily
through
whelchel
v.
mcdonald
which
said
that
if
a
defense
is
not
allowed
and
that
case
it
was
an
insanity
defense
that
that
divest
the
court-martial
jurisdiction
on
that
basis
[voice
overlap]
on
the
first
amendment.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
the
first
amendment.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
present
his
ethical
concern
and
reason
for
declining
the
order.
now
first,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
he?s
brought
into
the
service,
after
orloff
versus
willoughby,
as
a
physician.
since
the
1800s,
physicians
can
only
be
brought
in
as
officers
in
(a)
since
orloff
v.
willoughby,
they
can
only
be
used
in
medical
capacities.
levy
cannot
be
ordered
to
take
a
gun,
shoot
and
do
those
kinds
of
things.
he
is
not
subject
to
that
kind
of
concern.
now
what
he
says
is
i
am
entitled
as
a
doctor
to
act
--
practice
as
a
doctor
and
i
am
protected
with
the
first
amendment
and
i
think
he
is
under
roe
and
under
doe.
i
think
we?re
getting
to
that
certainly
on
those
two
cases.
i
do
want
to
mention
that
dr.
levy
was
tried
and
convicted
as
you
well
know
for
conduct
unbecoming
of
an
officer
and
gentleman.
now,
there
is
no
clear
and
present
danger
there,
you
do
not
have
to
show
any
damage
there,
all
you
do
is
--
and
remember
these
are
pure
speech
charges,
the
conduct
charge,
the
order
charge
is
one
thing,
the
rest
of
the
charge
is
of
pure
speech,
he
is
not
doing
anything
but
talking,
just
talking.
and
where
is
he
talking,
he
is
talking
to
the
dermatology
clinic,
he
is
not
like
how
the
case
in
the
military
decided
after
this
that
said
a
man
can
be
prosecuted
under
133
for
carrying
a
sign
in
a
public
demonstration.
he
is
in
a
private
clinic.
there
are
utmost
13
people
who
have
heard
anyone
of
the
statements.
in
one
conversation
four
folks
heard
him.
now
he
is
in
private.
all
of
these
arguments
about
the
army
and
writing
statutes
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
that
would
be
fine
if
the
military
was
willing
to
give
up
what
it?
got.
and
what?s
it
got?
it?s
got
for
its
people
the
right
to
run
for
political
office.
now,
when
you
start
talking
about
statutes,
i
want
to
mention
two
things.
first,
if
it
is
too
difficult
to
write,
then
it
is
too
difficult
for
a
serviceman
to
understand
if
it
is
not
written.
and
the
second
thing
is,
that
army
regulation
600-20
paragraph
423
says
a
serviceman
?have
a
right
to
express
their
opinions
privately
and
informally
on
all
political
subjects
and
candidates
and
to
become
candidates
for
public
office.?
now
what
the
army
presently
has,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
you
were
asking
about
debating
societies.
it
looks
to
me
like
under
this
army
regulation
you
can
have
folks
in
the
same
company,
going
out
and
running
against
each
other.
now,
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
regulate
speech,
you
cannot
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
too
in
the
army
and
that
is
what
they
got
now.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
really,
it?s
that
is
only
a
part
of
it
and
of
course
that?s
a
medical
question,
as
far
as,
whether
it?
better
or
worse
like
if
you
gave
everybody
a
penicillin
shot
,
would
the
world
be
better
off
or
not
and
some
doctors
would
argue
either
way.
in
this
case
we
brought
forward
the
following
witnesses:
john
mayer
(ph),
dr.
saddap
(ph),
peter
bourne
of
the
walter
reed
institute
of
research
and
they
came
forward,
these
physicians
and
they
said
this
is
an
appropriate
ethical
concern.
they
said
we
recognize
this
and
physicians
who
were
in
the
army
said
if
they
had
levy?s
factual
knowledge
if
what
he
knew
was
true,
dr.
mauer
and
others,
they
would
not
give
training.
now
the
concern
was
just
not
to
how
this
treatment
came
on
the
field,
for
instance
dr.
bourne
came
to
a
different
conclusion
on
ethical
concerns.
he
thought
it
went
the
other
way
in
as
far
as
he
personally
was
concerned.
but
the
question
was,
may
the
physician
for
a
valid
ethical
concern
as
with
most
ethics,
is
it
right
or
wrong,
is
another
question.
and
levy?s
position
primarily
was
not
that
the
people
out
in
the
field
were
worst
off
or
better
off
with
medicine.
levy?s
position
was
that
they
were
military
personnel
using
medicine
for
military
and
political
purposes
and
that
(b)
would
never
know
whether
they
were
better
off
with
or
without
it
and
throughout
the
record
it
is
quite
interesting
to
go
back
and
see
what
special
forces
have
testified
about
the
quality
of
medical
care
out
there
in
the
field.
they
are
saying
they
go
in
and
they
use
words
like
panax,
witch
doctors
and
acupuncturists,
doctors
with
needles,
i
am
not
so
sure
those
folks,
myself
when
i
got
there,
were
better
off.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
as
to
whether
doctors
or
subordinate
officers
in
the
military
are
free.
yes,
there
is
no
question
that
you
can?t
to
that
to
a
chaplain,
there?s
no
question
that
there?s
an
attorney-client
privilege
in
the
military
but
there
is
no
physician-patient
privilege
recognized
and
doctors
are
different
and
the
nature
of
their
works
there.
now
i
want
to
mention
this
to
you,
as
far
as
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer,
a
gentleman
is
concerned.
there
was
a
case
in
1827
in
which
the
court-martial
decided
that
the
conduct
of
an
admiral,
the
first
jewish
commodore
rather
in
the
navy,
admiral
commodore
uriah
levy,
they
decided
then
that
the
conduct
of
a
dual
over
honor
was
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
but
not
that
of
a
gentleman.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
even
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
if
you
take
its
words
at
fair
meaning,
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
can
also
be
sometimes
itself.
conduct
becoming
a
gentleman.
and
that
the
statute
in
its
very
words
are
mutually
inconsistent
and
that
in
this
case
for
instance,
have
they
charged
dr.
levy?s
conduct
of
not
allowing
special
forces
to
walk
in
and
stare
at
his
woman-patients,
that
under
that
circumstance
lots
of
us
would
consider
the
conduct
would
have
been
appropriate
with
respect
to
a
gentleman
but
not
an
officer.
with
respect
to
134
and
133,
there
is
no
question
in
this
record
whether
dr.
levy
did
not
have
the
notice
that
the
appellant?s
case
is
based
on.
he
came
into
the
service,
he
did
not
get
the
training
other
army
doctors
get.
they
did
not
take
him
to
fort
sam
houston.
they
brought
him
in
and
they
put
him
in
the
clinic.
throughout
the
case,
there?s
no
--
there?s
not
an
iota
of
evidence
that
levy
knew
what
was
prohibited
or
what
wasn?t
prohibited
under
133
or
134.
now
beyond
that,
the
army
regulation
says
that
he
may
express
his
opinion
privately
and
informally
on
all
political
subjects
and
candidates
and
to
become
candidates
for
public
officers.
where
did
he
express
his
opinion?
he
did
it
in
his
office.
now
what
was
levy
doing
in
his
spare
time?
he
didn?t
join
the
officer?s
club,
that?s
in
the
record.
he
went
out
and
participated,
and
vote
a
registration
campaigns
in
civil
rights
work
in
civilian
clothes
off
post,
off
based.
and
we
have
been
attempting
a
civilian
counsel
with
a
clearance
for
top
secret
in
another
military
case
to
get
our
hands
on
the
very
g2-a
that
the
colonel
testified,
he
upgraded
the
charges
after
reading.
he
based
the
upgrading
of
charges
from
article
15
to
a
general
court-martial
after
he
read
the
g2-a.
they
gave
us
80
pages.
they
gave
our
military
counsel
180
pages
and
said
he
could
not
tell
me
what
was
in
it.
and
we
know
now
because
they
wrote
the
district
court
that
25
pages
came
from
non-army
sources
and
had
to
get
released
on
that
and
everything
down
the
line
but
the
very
charges
colonel
francey
testified
were
based
upon
the
g2-a
and
his
reading
of
it
and
he
upgraded
it
on
that
basis.
now,
this
--
with
respect
to
broadrick
and
with
respect
to
letter
carriers,
it
seems
to
me
that
levy
complies
completely
with
the
requirements
of
that
case
and
that
this
case
is
quite
appropriate
for
judgment.
in
broadrick
and
in
letter
carriers,
you
have
a
statute
which
goes
to
political
activity
and
in
effect
to
political
speech.
in
this
case,
you
have
a
statute
which
goes
to
everything
and
does
so
by
its
nature
and
because
that
is
what
the
service
wanted.
we
can
stand
up
here
and
talk
about
defining
and
doing
this
and
that
but
the
very
purpose
for
133
and
134
is,
to
catch
all
its
catch
22.
they
say
that
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
get
all
sorts
of
conduct.
to
talk
about
the
findings,
that
is
not
what
the
military
wants
with.
not
only
does
it
not
want
to
--
it
doesn?t
want
to
tell
you
about
political
speech,
it
wants
to
keep
its
political
speech
under
its
regulations
and
it
wants
to
keep
the
right
for
its
people
to
run
for
office.
now,
letter
carriers
didn?t
do
that,
broadrick
didn?t
do
that,
and
neither
of
those
two
cases
say
in
the
least
anything
which
in
any
way,
inhibits
the
right
of
dr.
levy
to
strike
down
these
two
statutes
on
behalf
of
himself,
not
on
behalf
of
some
conduct
for
someone
else.
now,
i
want
to
--
words
are
harsh,
dr.
levy
used.
not
so
harsh
in
retrospect
as
they
were
back
then.
he
was
on
overseas
at
a
military
post.
he
had
not
been
through
ever
basic
training.
he
was
at
fort
jackson,
south
carolina
in
a
dermatology
clinic.
he
didn?t
want
to
be
there
but
he
was
there
and
he
was
a
good
doctor,
the
records,
not
a
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
at
the
nyu
in
bellevue,
as
i
recall
it
or
downstate,
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
the
words
mean
but
it?s
in
new
york
city.
the
prosecutor
never
took
a
position,
we
all
noticed
at
the
trial.
if
you
will
go
to
page
2497
of
the
record,
the
prosecutor
says
of
course
the
government?s
position
is
like
any
law,
the
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
are
without
specific
notification
binding
on
any
individual
in
the
military
service.
it?s
only
when
we
get
here
that
the
quad
drills
stands.
now,
i
--
the
case
presents
many
questions
but
the
one
thing
that
the
case
does
not
present
is
a
doctor
who
refused
to
train
medical
personnel.
the
one
thing
that
the
case
does
not
present
is
a
circumstance
wherein
a
person
was
convicted,
wherein
a
person
was
convicted
for
anything
other
than
his
political
beliefs
and
beliefs
that
were
thrust
upon
him
and
charged
against
him
by
colonel
henry
franklin
francey.
i
have
an
extract
in
the
record
as
to
what
this
loyalty
means
and
what
this
affection
means
in
the
brief,
perhaps,
that
will
demonstrate
appropriately
that
tremendous
confusion
that
can
occur
with
the
use
of
words
that
nobody
knows
the
meaning
of.
but
i
know
the
meaning
of
a
three-year
sentence
which
he
received
and
the
meaning
of
that
sentence
was
that
these
officers
with
no
standard
for
judgment
and
a
prosecutor
with
no
standard
for
judgment
and
a
colonel
who
testified
on
the
basis
of
an
undisclosed-a,
he
was
charged
in
this
fellow
with
being
disloyal.
that
they
took
those
charges
and
catapulted
them
up
and
the
only
thing
that
was
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
or
a
gentleman
in
the
entire
case,
and
the
only
discredit
that
came
to
the
service
was
the
court-martial
process
in
the
fact
that
it
occurred.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
officer
who
testified
david
travis
at
that
time
perhaps
the
most
decorated
american
in
vietnam
combat
soldier,
who
said,
?sure
i
have
been
at
fort
jackson,?
and
he
was
black
?and
i?ve
been
with
dr.
levy
and
he?s
talked
to
me
and
i?ve
disagreed
with
him.?
but
he
says,
?that?s
what
i
am
in
vietnam
fighting
for.?
his
free
expression
then
i
asked
him,
?and
where
do
you
go
from
here??
and
he
said,
?back
to
vietnam.?
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
really
what
this
case
is
all
about.
it?s
the
right
of
a
person
to
express
themselves
freely,
in
private,
to
practice
medicine,
and
to
give
the
military
their
very
best
even
if
they
don?t
want
to
and
maybe
those
problems
will
go
away,
now
that
we?ve
come
to
the
position
that
we
do
not
have
a
drafted
military
service,
but
a
voluntary
military
service.
and
perhaps,
i
don?t
know
that
will
result
in
some
military
men
when
they
are
entering
the
service,
giving
up
some
of
those
rights
of
civilians.
if
it
does
and
they
are
going
to
write
a
statute,
they
better
get
away
from
saying
military
men
can
run
for
office
and
discuss
privately
any
political
matters
that
come
to
their
minds.
thank
you.
