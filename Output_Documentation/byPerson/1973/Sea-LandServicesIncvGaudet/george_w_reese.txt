mr.
george
w.
reese
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
questions
that
we’re
asked
about
--
get
my
notes
--
about
the
inheritance
and
the
damages
of
particularly
interesting
in
louisiana
because
what
happened
to
this
judgment
is
the
lady
had
a
son
who
is
a
major
and
in
louisiana
with
one
child,
the
surviving
widow
inherits
the
community
property
which
has
happens
to
be
judgment
of
a
husband
as
a
community
property.
she
inherits
half
of
the
judgment
directly
and
her
child
who
is
a
major,
not
dependent
and
wouldn't
have
a
claim
under
moragne
by
the
(inaudible).
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes.
[laughter
attempt]
he
is
a
major
not
a
minor.
yes,
and
he
therefore
would
not
have
pecuniary
loss
involved
in
his
father’s
death
and
therefore
would
not
have
been
a
claimant
under
the
moragne
decision
and
he
did
inherit
the
--
what
we
call
the
--
well
his
mother
inherited
a
usufruct
of
his
half.
it
gets
a
little
complicated
depending
on
the
number
of
children.
if
there
are
more
children
the
mother’s
half
portion
goes
down,
the
children
portion
goes
up,
she
inherits
her
share,
her
portion
and
i
guess
they
called
fee
simple
in
common
law
and
she
gets
a
usufruct
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
word
is
in
common
law
part
but,
she
gets
to
use
of
it
during
her
lifetime
or
until
she
remarry.
mr.
george
w.
reese
sir?
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes,
i
think
it
is
life
status,
i’ve
never
taken
that
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
succession.
well,
i
thought
what
was
used
pretty
generally
too.
i’m
fairly
parochial
if
you
don’t
mind
to.
succession,
it’s
--
[laughter
attempt].
so
the
answer
is
that,
you
know,
this
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
this
lady
inheriting
this
entire
judgment.
louisiana
law
does
not
provide
for
that.
i
am
assuming
there
are
differences
in
states
all
over
the
union
which
make
the
inheritance
entirely
different.
in
most
state
as
i
understand
it
from
the
right
of
a
dependent
to
collect
money
damages
for
loss.
mr.
george
w.
reese
right,
yes
and
has
to
be
distributed
under
a
different
set
of
rules
then
your
decisions
in
moragne
are
going
to
be.
i
mean
in
the
outgrowths
of
your
decisions
in
moragne.
mr.
george
w.
reese
well,
i
don’t
(voice
overlap).
i’ll
produce
evidence
that
the
man
would
not
recover
from
his
condition.
counsel
defending
it
vociferously
defended.
mr.
george
w.
reese
we've
produced
no
actuary
at
the
time.
we
did
produce
medical
evidence
of
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
think
he
would
recover
to
be
able
to
perform
the
same
occupation
he
had
performed
before.
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes
sir.
mr.
george
w.
reese
very
practically
speaking,
i'll
say
there’s
no
doubt.
mr.
george
w.
reese
well,
let
me
say
that
there
is
a
principle
involved,
you
know
principle
of
law
involved.
i
don’t
know
and
i
don’t
think
any
of
us
here
now
looking
at
the
jury’s
verdict
whether
or
not
that
jury
took
into
consideration.
mr.
george
w.
reese
it
went
to
them
five
years
after
the
man
died.
mr.
george
w.
reese
right.
mr.
george
w.
reese
it’s
based
on
--
the
child
now
in
this
particular
case
doesn’t
have
any.
there
could
be
a
situation
for
instance
in
louisiana
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
well,
no.
i
am
saying
under
the
moragne
decision
because
you
all
said,
it
was
the
loss
of
those
loved
ones
and
their
particular
loss
involved.
so,
he
is
a
major,
would
have
no
pecuniary
loss
arising
out
of
it,
he
earns
a
decent
income.
there
is
a
possibility
in
louisiana
law
that
a
person
could
have
five
children
or
four
children
and
the
widow
who
is
the
big
looser
financially
might
end
up
only
getting
1/4
of
this
recovery,
and
the
children
would
get
the
other
--
at
least
the
fee
simple
of
the
other
--
of
the
rest
of
the
3/4
and
it
definitely
then
wouldn't
cover
no
matter
what
the
jury
gave
him
for
his
future
loss.
they
would
be
giving
money
to
four
children
who
don’t
need
the
money.
whereas
the
wife
who
took
the
pecuniary
loss
would
end
up,
with
a
lot
--
an
awful
lot
loss
after
paying
a
lawyer.
you
know,
it
is
a
contingent
fee
proposition.
there
are
a
lot
of
factors
involved
in
it
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
well,
i
agree
with
first
have
of
your
statement
and
disagree
with
the
second
half.
if
that's
already
being
done,
when
counsel
suggests
that
if
a
man
dies
before
the
thing
--
well
not
really
--
no
it
wouldn’t
fair
saying
that.
but
what
i
am
saying
is,
is
that
the
second
jury
would
have
--
of
the
second
fact
finder
would
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
which
part
of
a
$175,000.00
for
instance
took
credit
against
what
they
are
going
to
give
her
in
a
trial
for
her
own
pecuniary
loss,
i
mean
on
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
no,
sir.
it
was
dismissed
in
the
district
court,
reversed
in
the
circuit,
and
then
this
court
find
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
i
am
suggesting
it
is
absolutely
no
way
to
avoid
it.
yes,
sir.
definitely,
it
would
become
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
i
think
it
is
a
complicated
problem
which
is
what
we
suggested
in
the
brief
in
the
fifth
circuit
but
because
it
is
a
complicated
problem
or
because
it
creates
some
difficulty
in
the
ascertainment
of
damages.
you
know
i
think
that
principles
still
stands,
but
--
and
let
me
say,
i
admit
i
got
a
fairly
big
verdict
in
this
thing
but
the
verdict
could've
been
$35,000.00.
you
know
the
jury
could
have
decided
the
counsel
was
right
and
possibly
he
hadn’t
really
been
permanently
disabled
and
then
died
10
days
later
and
you'd
be
presented
with
an
entirely
different
set
of
facts
with
a
35-year-old
widow
and
you
know,
eight
minor
children.
it
could
work
out
that
way
too.
you
know,
so
what
we
are
talking
about
i
believe
is
the
principle
out
of
moragne.
you
know,
we’re
talking
about
sifting
down
[laughter
attempt]
sifted
right
back
up
to
you,
all
i
am
afraid.
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes
sir.
and
i
am
saying
that
had
this
man
died
before
the
date
of
judgment
that
same
situation
could
have
existed.
i
am
saying
that
--
what
i
am
suggesting,
if
the
rule
is
worked
out
that
the
second
jury
who
decides
the
wife’s
case
is
given
instructions
on
crediting,
the
money
the
she
received
--
that
she
received,
now,
not
that
the
whole
family
received,
but
that
she
received
as
a
result
to
this
thing,
yes,
they
could
end
up
paying
more
money,
there
isn’t
any
question
about
it.
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes.
mr.
george
w.
reese
excuse
me,
i
am
sorry
[laughter
attempt]
i
didn’t
mean
to
interrupt.
mr.
george
w.
reese
when
counsel
was
discussing
the
matter
of
the
various
statutes,
there
aren't
just
two
or
three,
you
know,
there
is
lord
campbell’s
act
which
by
the
way
is
what
the
fela
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
deal
is.
that’s
exactly
what
the
language
is
comes
right
out
of
it,
and
those
cases
are
based
the
mellon
and
those
cases
are
based
strictly
on
an
interpretation
of
those
words
which
say
that
the
claim
must
be
pending
at
the
time
of
the
decedent’s
death.
you
know,
it's
in
it
--
it
is
an
interpretation
of
legislative
intent.
you
cannot
get
around
it.
the
pure
death
claims
that
have
been
discussed
in
wilson
versus
masingill,
they
are
cases
that
say
exactly
what
i
am
suggesting
this
court
adopt
from
moragne.
i’m
not
coming
up
you
know
with
the
brand
new
approach.
i
admit
i’m
coming
here
with
the
minority
approach,
but
there
were
part
--
death
parts
survival
action
which
is
a
usual
thing
by
the
way.
i
think
that
there
are
very
few
pure
survival
statutes,
death
on
the
high
seas
happens
to
be
one.
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes,
i
am
suggesting
exactly
that.
and
if
you
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
right
and
the
reason
l
am
suggesting
it
is
that
congress
has
adopted
some
ancient
language
in
connection
with
the
fela.
mr.
george
w.
reese
no,
i
do
agree
with
that
and
i
do
agree
that
what
i
am
suggesting
is
a
minority
position
and
i
am
agreeing
that
congress
has
in
the
fela
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
adopted
the
lord
campbell
act.
mr.
george
w.
reese
and
other
things.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
w.
reese
no
doubt
about
it.
and
what
i
am
saying
here
this
after
--
well,
it
is
not
afternoon,
this
morning
is
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
legislature
--
legislation
and
arbitrating
this,
you
know
in
the
matter
of
admiralty
law
that
you
create
in
effect,
you
know
like
we
could
look
that's
clearly
in
the
eye
and
i
think
that
the
conflict
probably
is
between
a
very
harsh
rule
that
you
could
adopt
by
using
the
congressional
language
and
other
language
that
you
all
have
adopted
in
previous
cases
in
discussing
admiralty
and
the,
you
know,
type
of
feeling
you
ought
to
have
toward
the
wards
of
this
court
in
admiralty
matters.
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes,
it
would
help
my
case
and
by
the
way
(voice
overlap).
it
has
not
been
determined.
mr.
george
w.
reese
aren’t
you
also
assuming
the
cases
you’re
talking
about
and
still
come
in
with
the
fela,
you
still
have
the
opportunity
and
it
has
not
been
decided
yet
by
this
court
or
any
circuits
as
far
as
i
know
whether
moragne
is
limited
to
pecuniary
loss.
i
understand
that.
mr.
george
w.
reese
and
you
know,
that
is
another
day
and
another
hour
and
possibly
it
might
have
some
effect
on
your
decision
in
this
case.
i
think
that
is
basically
all
i
have
to
answer
in
connection
with
counsel’s
statement.
i
don’t
read
the
moragne
case
to
indicate
anything
but
that
you
can’t
recover,
maybe
all
wrote
it
differently
and
i'm
reading
it
wrong
ubt
i
don't
if
you
all
wrote
it
definitely
and
i
am
reading
it.
but,
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
a
pure
survival
action
in
moragne.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
--
it
reads
like
a
pure
death
claim.
it
reads
like
the
type
of
thing
wilson
versus
masingill
says
the
south
carolina
statutes
like.
any
other
questions?
thank
you
sir,
thank
you
sir.
mr.
george
w.
reese
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
questions
that
we’re
asked
about
--
get
my
notes
--
about
the
inheritance
and
the
damages
of
particularly
interesting

because
what
happened
to

is
the

the

which
has
happens
to

of

she
inherits
half
of
the
judgment
directly
and
her

who
is
a

not

and
wouldn't
have
a

mr.
george
w.

yes.
[laughter

he

a

yes,
and
he

would
not
have
pecuniary
loss
involved
in
his

and
therefore
would
not

and
he
did

the

well
his

a

of
his

it
gets
a

if

more
children
the
mother’s

goes

the

goes
up,
she
inherits
her

her

and
i
guess
they
called

in

and
she
gets

i

mr.

it
went
to
them
five
years
after
the
man
died.
mr.
george
w.
reese
right.
mr.
george
w.
reese
it’s
based
on
--
the

in

the
second
half.
if
that's
already
being
done,
when
counsel
suggests
that
if
a
man
dies
before
the
thing
--
well
not
really
--
no
it
wouldn’t
fair
saying
that.
but
what
i
am
saying
is,
is
that
the
second
jury
would
have
--
of
the
second
fact
finder
would
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
which
part
of
a
$175,000.00
for
instance
took
credit
against
what
they
are
going
to
give
her
in
a
trial
for
her
own
pecuniary
loss,
i
mean
on
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
no,
sir.
it
was
dismissed
in
the
district
court,
reversed
in
the
circuit,
and
then
this
court
find
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
i
am
suggesting
it
is
absolutely
no
way
to
avoid
it.
yes,
sir.
definitely,
it
would
become
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
i
think
it
is
a
complicated
problem
which
is
what
we
suggested
in
the
brief
in
the
fifth
circuit
but
because
it
is
a
complicated
problem
or
because
it
creates
some
difficulty
in
the
ascertainment
of
damages.
you
know
i
think
that
principles
still
stands,
but
--
and
let
me
say,
i
admit
i
got
a
fairly
big
verdict
in
this
thing
but
the
verdict
could've
been
$35,000.00.
you
know
the
jury
could
have
decided
the
counsel
was
right
and
possibly
he
hadn’t
really
been
permanently
disabled
and
then
died
10
days
later
and
you'd
be
presented
with
an
entirely
different
set
of
facts
with
a
35-year-old
widow
and
you
know,
eight
minor
children.
it
could
work
out
that
way
too.
you
know,
so
what
we
are
talking
about
i
believe
is
the
principle
out
of
moragne.
you
know,
we’re
talking
about
sifting
down
[laughter
attempt]
sifted
right
back
up
to
you,
all
i
am
afraid.
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes
sir.
and
i
am
saying
that
had
this
man
died
before
the
date
of
judgment
that
same
situation
could
have
existed.
i
am
saying
that
--
what
i
am
suggesting,
if
the
rule
is
worked
out
that
the
second
jury
who
decides
the
wife’s
case
is
given
instructions
on
crediting,
the
money
the
she
received
--
that
she
received,
now,
not
that
the
whole
family
received,
but
that
she
received
as
a
result
to
this
thing,
yes,
they
could
end
up
paying
more
money,
there
isn’t
any
question
about
it.
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes.
mr.
george
w.
reese
excuse
me,
i
am
sorry
[laughter
attempt]
i
didn’t
mean
to
interrupt.
mr.
george
w.
reese
when
counsel
was
discussing
the
matter
of
the
various
statutes,
there
aren't
just
two
or
three,
you
know,
there
is
lord
campbell’s
act
which
by
the
way
is
what
the
fela
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
deal
is.
that’s
exactly
what
the
language
is
comes
right
out
of
it,
and
those
cases
are
based
the
mellon
and
those
cases
are
based
strictly
on
an
interpretation
of
those
words
which
say
that
the
claim
must
be
pending
at
the
time
of
the
decedent’s
death.
you
know,
it's
in
it
--
it
is
an
interpretation
of
legislative
intent.
you
cannot
get
around
it.
the
pure
death
claims
that
have
been
discussed
in
wilson
versus
masingill,
they
are
cases
that
say
exactly
what
i
am
suggesting
this
court
adopt
from
moragne.
i’m
not
coming
up
you
know
with
the
brand
new
approach.
i
admit
i’m
coming
here
with
the
minority
approach,
but
there
were
part
--
death
parts
survival
action
which
is
a
usual
thing
by
the
way.
i
think
that
there
are
very
few
pure
survival
statutes,
death
on
the
high
seas
happens
to
be
one.
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes,
i
am
suggesting
exactly
that.
and
if
you
--
mr.
george
w.
reese
right
and
the
reason
l
am
suggesting
it
is
that
congress
has
adopted
some
ancient
language
in
connection
with
the
fela.
mr.
george
w.
reese
no,
i
do
agree
with
that
and
i
do
agree
that
what
i
am
suggesting
is
a
minority
position
and
i
am
agreeing
that
congress
has
in
the
fela
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
adopted
the
lord
campbell
act.
mr.
george
w.
reese
and
other
things.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
w.
reese
no
doubt
about
it.
and
what
i
am
saying
here
this
after
--
well,
it
is
not
afternoon,
this
morning
is
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
legislature
--
legislation
and
arbitrating
this,
you
know
in
the
matter
of
admiralty
law
that
you
create
in
effect,
you
know
like
we
could
look
that's
clearly
in
the
eye
and
i
think
that
the
conflict
probably
is
between
a
very
harsh
rule
that
you
could
adopt
by
using
the
congressional
language
and
other
language
that
you
all
have
adopted
in
previous
cases
in
discussing
admiralty
and
the,
you
know,
type
of
feeling
you
ought
to
have
toward
the
wards
of
this
court
in
admiralty
matters.
mr.
george
w.
reese
yes,
it
would
help
my
case
and
by
the
way
(voice
overlap).
it
has
not
been
determined.
mr.
george
w.
reese
aren’t
you
also
assuming
the
cases
you’re
talking
about
and
still
come
in
with
the
fela,
you
still
have
the
opportunity
and
it
has
not
been
decided
yet
by
this
court
or
any
circuits
as
far
as
i
know
whether
moragne
is
limited
to
pecuniary
loss.
i
understand
that.
mr.
george
w.
reese
and
you
know,
that
is
another
day
and
another
hour
and
possibly
it
might
have
some
effect
on
your
decision
in
this
case.
i
think
that
is
basically
all
i
have
to
answer
in
connection
with
counsel’s
statement.
i
don’t
read
the
moragne
case
to
indicate
anything
but
that
you
can’t
recover,
maybe
all
wrote
it
differently
and
i'm
reading
it
wrong
ubt
i
don't
if
you
all
wrote
it
definitely
and
i
am
reading
it.
but,
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
a
pure
survival
action
in
moragne.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
--
it
reads
like
a
pure
death
claim.
it
reads
like
the
type
of
thing
wilson
versus
masingill
says
the
south
carolina
statutes
like.
any
other
questions?
thank
you
sir,
thank
you
sir.
