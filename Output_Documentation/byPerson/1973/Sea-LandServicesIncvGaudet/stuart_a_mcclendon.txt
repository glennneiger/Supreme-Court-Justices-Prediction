mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
for
a
discussion
and
hopefully
a
clarification
of
the
rights
of
litigants
under
the
general
maritime
law
and
under
the
wrongful-death
recovery
allowed
by
the
court
in
the
moragne
case
in
1970.
at
that
time
when
the
court
overruled
the
harrisburg
and
allowed
recovery
under
general
maritime
law
for
wrongful-death,
the
court
did
not
set
any
stringent
or
specific
guidelines
for
future
cases
but
stated
that
the
siftings
through
the
court
would
bring
about
hopefully
a
consistent
law
in
this
area.
in
the
case
before
us
today,
mr.
gaudet
was
injured
in
1966.
he
was
a
foreman
longshoreman.
he
was
injured
aboard
a
vessel
in
the
mississippi
river
in
the
port
of
new
orleans.
he
instituted
suit
in
u.s.
district
court
and
brought
it
to
judgment
for
the
amount
of
$175,000.00.
ten
days
after
the
jury
award
which
was
rendered
in
the
court
of
proper
jurisdiction,
mr.
gaudet
died.
his
widow
did
not
come
in
to
those
proceedings
requesting
any
damages
for
his
death
or
any
modification
of
the
award.
post-trial,
motions
were
filed
and
these
were
rejected
by
the
trial
court.
the
matter
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
appeal
failed
and
the
judgment
was
obtained.
mrs.
gaudet
proceeded
with
a
separate
suit
alleging
that
she
had
sustained
severe
financial
loss
as
a
result
of
the
death
of
her
husband.
and
after
reversing
the
trial
court’s
rejection
of
her
claim,
the
fifth
circuit
had
rendered
the
decision
stating
that
the
previously
received
judgment
was
not
a
bar
to
her
actions
for
wrongful-death.
we
would
like
to
briefly
point
out
that
the
courts
have
recognized
although
at
times
have
been
confused
over
the
difference
between
a
survival
action
and
a
wrongful-death
action,
survival
being
purely
the
right
of
the
survivors
of
a
decedent
to
recover
for
the
damages
which
she
sustained
during
his
lifetime.
the
survival
action
the
damages
there
terminated
to
the
time
of
death.
the
wrongful-death
action
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
right
of
recovery
for
the
decedents
for
their
damages
sustained
after
the
death
of
the
individual.
this
court
has
dealt
with
these
matters
in
flynn
case
and
the
mellon
versus
goodyear
and
the
michigan
versus
vreeland
cases
and
all
of
these
were
fela
cases
which
took
lord
campbell’s
act
which
had
--
which
was
referred
to
in
the
moragne
decision
and
said
that
the
right
of
recovery
for
wrongful-death
is
a
right
which
only
exist
if
in
the
decedent
there
existed
a
right
at
the
time
of
his
death.
and
we
are
here
today
because
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
even
though
mr.
gaudet
had
received
a
judgment,
had
obtained
a
judgment
that
in
some
manner,
the
widow
had
a
right
to
go
file
with
the
claim
for
wrongful-death.
we
submit
that
the
claim
for
wrongful
death
is
a
derivative
action
and
is
derived
from
the
initial
tort,
the
initial
injury.
we're
not
dealing
of
an
instantaneous
death
which
was
not
dealt
within
these
cases.
we're
dealing
with
an
injury
which
results
in
certain
injuries
to
the
individual
and
then
it's
some
time
later
there
is
death,
weeks
or
months
or
in
some
of
these
cases
many
years
later.
and
the
courts
have
held
especially
under
mellon
case
that
the
right
is
a
derivative
right
and
it
derive
from
the
original
injury
which
the
injured
man
sustained
at
the
time
he
was
involved
in
the
accident,
and
if
there
is
no
viable
cause
of
action
or
right
on
his
part,
immediately
prior
to
his
death,
that
his
heirs
cannot
renew
their
right
to
claim
their
damages.
this
is
the
question
which
--
one
of
the
questions
before
the
court
today,
we
also
submitted
on
our
petition
for
writs
that
if
the
court
should
find
that
--
that
the
recovery
is
proper,
then
the
uniformity
which
is
desired
in
federal
law
and
admiralty
and
maritime
matters
and
which
has
been
consistently
followed
in
the
jones
act
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
and
in
the
cases
since
moragne
in
1972
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
departing
from
this
by
allowing
damages
for
nonpecuniary
loss.
all
of
the
cases
under
the
jones
act,
death
on
the
high
seas
in
general
maritime
law
have
stated
that
the
claim
of
the
defendant,
the
damages
of
the
defendant
must
pay
are
pecuniary
and
loss
of
love
and
affection,
society,
companionship,
consortium
are
not
recovered.
since
mrs.
gaudet
inherited
the
judgment
of
her
husband
in
the
amount
of
a
$175,000.00
and
eventually
collected
it,
we
submit
that
this
is
full
pecuniary
recovery
for
the
damages
that
were
sustained,
and
that
the
only
recovery
which
we
submit,
there
should
not
be
any
but
if
the
court
should
say
that
in
some
manner
a
cause
of
action
exist
even
though
there
wasn’t
one
at
the
time
of
death,
then,
we
submit
that
in
order
to
maintain
uniformity
that
only
non
--
only
pecuniary
losses
should
be
allowed
and
that
this
have
already
been
paid
in
this
case.
this
is
the
matter
before
the
court
today.
if
the
court
has
any
questions,
we
would
be
happy
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
i
don’t
feel
so
your
honor
that
it
--
there
was
no
question
that
she
was
the
proper
representative
in
a
surviving
spouse,
she
did
in
fact
inherit.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
no,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
we
submit
that
it
became
a
property
right
which
was
then
inherited
by
the
heirs
at
the
time
of
death
that
when
the
jury
award
was
rendered
that
a
cause
of
action
ceased
to
exist
and
it
was
merged
into
a
property
right
which
was
then
inherited
by
her.
that
the
cause
of
action
was
not
pending.
if
it
had
been
pending,
if
there
was
a
pending
claim
at
the
time
of
death,
we
feel
the
law
is
clear
that
there
can
be
an
amendment
or
a
merger
of
the
claim
of
the
decedent
for
his
damages
into
a
wrongful-death
action.
but
if
the
claim
of
the
decedent
for
his
damages
has
been
terminated
by
settlement,
by
proscription,
by
statute
of
limitations
or
by
judgment,
then
their
--
this
precludes
any
right
of
the
heirs,
of
the
–-
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir
and
there
are
minor
children,
wife
and
ascendants.
then
suppose
they
were
not
--
did
not
inherit
in
anyway
his
estate?
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
if
there
was
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
i
think
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
i'm
not
wanting
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
your
honor,
i’m
not
–-
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
i’m
not
wishing
to
argue
with
count
--
with
the
court
but
it
submitted
that
the
lord
campbell’s
act
actually
was
a
wrongful-death
statute
which
gave
to
the
dependents
a
right
to
--
and
then
to
cover
that
whole
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
an
independent
right
of
action
which
did
however
depend
upon
the
existence
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
of
a
right
at
the
time
of
death,
at
the
time
of
death.
and
in
the
carol
case
which
is
a
case
from
the
supreme
court,
the
court
said
the
two
can
be
merged
if
the
first
has
not
been
extinguished,
then
it
can
be
merged
into
the
claim
of
the
dependents,
but
they
are
two
separate
cause
of
action.
we
prefer
for
clarity
to
try
to
distinguish
between
a
survival
action
which
perhaps
half
of
the
states
have,
which
enables
the
representative
of
the
decedent
to
carry
on
the
claims
that
he
has
sustained
during
his
lifetime.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
exactly.
but
there's
–-
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
whereas
the
wrong
--
the
true
wrongful-death
act
which
is
the
lord
campbell
act
(voice
overlap)
in
which
every
state
has
is
the
right
of
the
dependents
to
sue
for
their
damages
which
have
occurred
of
course
after
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
for
the
loss.
yes,
sir.
but
the
lord
campbell’s
act
which
was,
you
might
say
the
original
true
wrongful-death
act
said
that
says
it
is
a
derivative
action
which
goes
back
to
the
initial
--
the
original
tort
that
in
order
for
the
dependents
to
exercise
their
cause
of
action
after
the
death
of
the
decedent,
there
had
to
be
in
existence
at
the
time
of
death
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
decedent
himself
to
sue
for
his
damages.
and
if
he
extinguished
that
right
in
some
manner
this
extinguishes
the
separate
right
of
the
dependents.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
i
believe
there
was
and
i
am
sure
counsel
would
bring
this
out
his
arguments.
the
award
was
a
$175,000.00
and
the
injury
was
a
back
injury.
he’d
had
surgery.
the
psychiatrist
did
said
that
it
had
created
emotional
problems
that
he'd
become
addicted
to
his
own
medication.
he
was
having
a
drug
addiction
problem
and
he
was
severely
emotionally
disturbed
and
he
was
about
45
year-old
man
at
the
time.
approximate
20-year
work
life
expectancy,
evidence
was
submitted
as
to
his
total
inability
to
work
for
life.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir,
this
was
a
contention
of
course,
being
a
jury
award,
there
was
no
breakdown
in
the
award
as
to
what
portion.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir,
yes,
they
did.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
no,
your
honor.
no
sir
because
of
the
desire
of
all
the
courts
to
bring
it
into
litigation
and
when
the
matter
was
--
was
the
evidence
was
produced
that
its
initial
trial,
it
anticipated
everything
that
would
happen
to
him.
now
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
we
submit
that
the
claim
of
the
dependent
--but
now
he
dies
and
the
impression
is
to
his
--
what
if
any
additional
cause
of
action
do
his
dependents
have
for
his
wrongful-death
attributable
to
that
same
tortuous
injury.
we
submit
your
honor,
that
since
it
is
a
derivative
right
which
goes
back
to
the
original
tort
and
must
continue
in
a
viable
state
until
the
death
that
the
judgment,
even
though
it
may
have
been
inadequate,(inaudible)
and
the
dependents,
small
children
perhaps
with
many
years
of
dependency
are
precluded
from
making
any
claim.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
well,
under
the
general
maritime
law,
under
the
law,
no,
under
the
statutes,
no
and
the
courts
of
course
have
gone
into
states
statutes
and
gone
into
the
state,
wrongful-death
and
to
the
state
survival
statutes.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir
and
of
course
loss
of
support
is
a
very
large
item
of
--
in
a
wrongful-death
claim,
in
the
event
that
death
has
occurred
almost
immediately
with
the
accident.
then
the
dependents
have
a
very
large
claim
for
the
loss
of
support.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
this
is
true.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
there
would
be
two
cause
of
action.
his
own
cause
of
action
would
survive
and
would
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
into
the
widow
or
representative.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
and
then,
there
would
come
into
existence
at
the
time
of
death,
a
wrongful-death
action
for
the
dependents
for
their
loss
of
the
loved
one.
there
would
be
two
causes
of
action,
but
there
was
only
one
wrong,
the
initial
accident.
the
courts
have
not
looked,
excuse
me,
at
the
death
as
a
wrong.
they
have
looked
at
it
more
as
an
item
of
damages
that
flowed
from
the
initial
wrong.
and
so
when
the
claim
of
the
decedent
has
been
extinguished
and
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
wrong,
the
courts
have
said
that
the
death
does
not
bring
into
existence
a
cause
of
action
--
it's
not
new
tort,
it's
just
an
element
of
damage.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
no,
sir,
they
may
be
merged
and
one
merged
die
in
the
carol
case
which
is
a
supreme
court
case
and
which
are
commonly
merged.
commonly
merged
when
death
occurs
shortly
after
the
accident
or
simultaneously
with
it,
of
course
if
it
is
a
simultaneous
death,
an
instantaneous
death,
there
would
be
no
survival
action.
yes
sir?
if
--
say
a
seaman
sues
for
injuries
under
the
jones
act
and
that
occurred
on
the
high
seas?
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
there
is
a
survival
--
well,
in
your
question
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
then
we
submit
that
he
would
have
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
we
don’t
have
holdings
on
jones
act,
your
honor.
we
don’t.
all
of
the
holdings
under
fela.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
let’s
see,
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
if
he
had
recovered
during
his
lifetime,
there
are
no
cases
under
death
on
the
high
seas
act
as
we
see
the
--
they
are
all
under
fela.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
actually
on
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
rule
is
rather
harsh.
it
says
that
if
the
injured
man
had
a
suit
underway
so
to
speak
and
he
dies,
then
all
of
his
claims
for
pain
and
suffering
are
extinguished.
it
cannot
be
passed
on
to
his
heirs
but
they
do
get
the
wrongful-death
claim
for
their
loss,
but
his
funeral
expenses
and
pain
and
suffering
claim
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
we
don’t
have
any
cases
under
death
of
the
high
seas
act.
but
if
it
is
a
result
of
the
fela
which
is
what
death
on
the
high
seas
is
change
from
the
(inaudible).
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
you’re
correct,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
then,
we
do
not
have
cases
and
we
do
not
know
of
cases
which
have
dealt
with
this
problem.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
did
not
include.
well,
no
service,
the
pain
and
suffering
would
be
the
decedents
of
the
claim.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
and
also
they
do
not.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
just
pecuniary
loss
on
the
death
on
the
high
seas.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
and
under
--
in
the
cases
since
moragne
except
for
a
louisiana
case,
there
has
been
only
recovery
for
pecuniary
loss.
we
will
reserve
the
rest
of
our
time.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
briefly
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir.
the
moragne
case
was
decided
to
provide
a
remedy
where
there
was
none
and
where
the
harshness
of
the
harrisburg
had
been
in
effect
made
a
mockery
out
of
it
over
the
years
by
various
bypass
procedures.
and
so
in
moragne
where
there
was
virtually
an
instantaneous
death,
a
widow
and
no
remedy
--
the
remedy
was
supplied
but
the
case
before
the
court
today
is
not
one
in
which
there
is
no
remedy.
the
remedy
was
perceived
and
the
fifth
circuit
points
out
the
problem
which
will
be
created
by
portion
one
of
the
damages
to
go
back
into
the
jury
award
and
try
to
determine
which
of
these
damages
where
anticipatory
of
the
death
or
of
the
loss
of
income
of
mr.
gaudet
in
the
footnote
on
page
4
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
again,
we
would
simply
point
out
that
the
fact
that
the
right
is
derivative
rather
than
representative,
is
in
our
opinion
the
crux
of
the
question
before
the
court.
if
the
original
tort
give
rise
to
two
causes
of
action
potentially,
then,
the
occurrence
of
the
death
is
not
that
which
creates
the
right
of
the
dependents
to
bring
their
action.
it's
the
original
tort
and
if
this
is
extinguished
by
the
injured
man
during
his
life,
the
courts
have
said
that
this
--
he
had
received
his
pecuniary
loss
and
you'are
opening
a
pandora’s
box
to
go
and
in
fact
to
carry
it
over.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
it
has
been
in
all
of
the
cases
your
honor.
well,
know.
nis
that
construction
of
the
statute
or
just
--
it
was
not
in
the
statute
--
statute.
no,
it
was
and
the
statute
just
set
damages
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
it
came
through
fela
and
it's
a
--
but
the
statute
set
damages.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
this
is
the
hiatus.
this
is
the
area
where
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir,
and
these
were
the
several
points
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir,
these
were
several
of
the
points
in
our
brief.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir,
whether
to
maintain
uniformity,
you’re
going
to
follow
what
has
been
done
in
the
other
act?
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
no,
sir,
that's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
it
is
a
question
of
compensation.
it
is
a
question
of
extinguishing
the
act
--
the
action
before
the
death
occurred.
it’s
scenario
were
--
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
a
true
counterpart
or
a
comparable
situation.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
it
is
the
love,
the
affection
and
relationship
of
the
husband
and
wife.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
it
is.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
for
a
discussion
and
hopefully
a
clarification
of
the
rights
of
litigants
under
the
general
maritime
law
and
under
the
wrongful-death
recovery
allowed
by
the
court
in
the
moragne
case
in
1970.
at
that
time
when
the
court
overruled
the
harrisburg
and
allowed
recovery
under
general
maritime
law
for
wrongful-death,
the
court
did
not
set
any
stringent
or
specific
guidelines
for
future
cases
but
stated
that
the
siftings
through
the
court
would
bring
about
hopefully
a
consistent
law
in
this
area.
in
the
case
before
us
today,
mr.
gaudet
was
injured
in
1966.
he
was
a
foreman
longshoreman.
he
was
injured
aboard
a
vessel
in
the
mississippi
river
in
the
port
of
new
orleans.
he
instituted
suit
in
u.s.
district
court
and
brought
it
to
judgment
for
the
amount
of
$175,000.00.
ten
days
after
the
jury
award
which
was
rendered
in
the
court
of
proper
jurisdiction,
mr.
gaudet
died.
his
widow
did
not
come
in
to
those
proceedings
requesting
any
damages
for
his
death
or
any
modification
of
the
award.
post-trial,
motions
were
filed
and
these
were
rejected
by
the
trial
court.
the
matter
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
appeal
failed
and
the
judgment
was
obtained.
mrs.
gaudet
proceeded
with
a
separate
suit
alleging
that
she
had
sustained
severe
financial
loss
as
a
result
of
the
death
of
her
husband.
and
after
reversing
the
trial
court’s
rejection
of
her
claim,
the
fifth
circuit
had
rendered
the
decision
stating
that
the
previously
received
judgment
was
not
a
bar
to
her
actions
for
wrongful-death.
we
would
like
to
briefly
point
out
that
the
courts
have
recognized
although
at
times
have
been
confused
over
the
difference
between
a
survival
action
and
a
wrongful-death
action,
survival
being
purely
the
right
of
the
survivors
of
a
decedent
to
recover
for
the
damages
which
she
sustained
during
his
lifetime.
the
survival
action
the
damages
there
terminated
to
the
time
of
death.
the
wrongful-death
action
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
right
of
recovery
for
the
decedents
for
their
damages
sustained
after
the
death
of
the
individual.
this
court
has
dealt
with
these
matters
in
flynn
case
and
the
mellon
versus
goodyear
and
the
michigan
versus
vreeland
cases
and
all
of
these
were
fela
cases
which
took
lord
campbell’s
act
which
had
--
which
was
referred
to
in
the
moragne
decision
and
said
that
the
right
of
recovery
for
wrongful-death
is
a
right
which
only
exist
if
in
the
decedent
there
existed
a
right
at
the
time
of
his
death.
and
we
are
here
today
because
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
even
though
mr.
gaudet
had
received
a
judgment,
had
obtained
a
judgment
that
in
some
manner,
the
widow
had
a
right
to
go
file
with
the
claim
for
wrongful-death.
we
submit
that
the
claim
for
wrongful
death
is
a
derivative
action
and
is
derived
from
the
initial
tort,
the
initial
injury.
we're
not
dealing
of
an
instantaneous
death
which
was
not
dealt
within
these
cases.
we're
dealing
with
an
injury
which
results
in
certain
injuries
to
the
individual
and
then
it's
some
time
later
there
is
death,
weeks
or
months
or
in
some
of
these
cases
many
years
later.
and
the
courts
have
held
especially
under
mellon
case
that
the
right
is
a
derivative
right
and
it
derive
from
the
original
injury
which
the
injured
man
sustained
at
the
time
he
was
involved
in
the
accident,
and
if
there
is
no
viable
cause
of
action
or
right
on
his
part,
immediately
prior
to
his
death,
that
his
heirs
cannot
renew
their
right
to
claim
their
damages.
this
is
the
question
which
--
one
of
the
questions
before
the
court
today,
we
also
submitted
on
our
petition
for
writs
that
if
the
court
should
find
that
--
that
the
recovery
is
proper,
then
the
uniformity
which
is
desired
in
federal
law
and
admiralty
and
maritime
matters
and
which
has
been
consistently
followed
in
the
jones
act
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
and
in
the
cases
since
moragne
in
1972
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
departing
from
this
by
allowing
damages
for
nonpecuniary
loss.
all
of
the
cases
under
the
jones
act,
death
on
the
high
seas
in
general
maritime
law
have
stated
that
the
claim
of
the
defendant,
the
damages
of
the
defendant
must
pay
are
pecuniary
and
loss
of
love
and
affection,
society,
companionship,
consortium
are
not
recovered.
since
mrs.
gaudet
inherited
the
judgment
of
her
husband
in
the
amount
of
a
$175,000.00
and
eventually
collected
it,
we
submit
that
this
is
full
pecuniary
recovery
for
the
damages
that
were
sustained,
and
that
the
only
recovery
which
we
submit,
there
should
not
be
any
but
if
the
court
should
say
that
in
some
manner
a
cause
of
action
exist
even
though
there
wasn’t
one
at
the
time
of
death,
then,
we
submit
that
in
order
to
maintain
uniformity
that
only
non
--
only
pecuniary
losses
should
be
allowed
and
that
this
have
already
been
paid
in
this
case.
this
is
the
matter
before
the
court
today.
if
the
court
has
any
questions,
we
would
be
happy
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
i
don’t
feel
so
your
honor
that
it
--
there
was
no
question
that
she
was
the
proper
representative
in
a
surviving
spouse,
she
did
in
fact
inherit.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
no,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
we
submit
that
it
became
a
property
right
which
was
then
inherited
by
the
heirs
at
the
time
of
death
that
when
the
jury
award
was
rendered
that
a
cause
of
action
ceased
to
exist
and
it
was
merged
into
a
property
right
which
was
then
inherited
by
her.
that
the
cause
of
action
was
not
pending.
if
it
had
been
pending,
if
there
was
a
pending
claim
at
the
time
of
death,
we
feel
the
law
is
clear
that
there
can
be
an
amendment
or
a
merger
of
the
claim
of
the
decedent
for
his
damages
into
a
wrongful-death
action.
but
if
the
claim
of
the
decedent
for
his
damages
has
been
terminated
by
settlement,
by
proscription,
by
statute
of
limitations
or
by
judgment,
then
their
--
this
precludes
any
right
of
the
heirs,
of
the
–-
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir
and
there
are
minor
children,
wife
and
ascendants.
then
suppose
they
were
not
--
did
not
inherit
in
anyway
his
estate?
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
if
there
was
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
i
think
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
i'm
not
wanting
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
your
honor,
i’m
not
–-
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
i’m
not
wishing
to
argue
with
count
--
with
the
court
but
it
submitted
that
the
lord
campbell’s
act
actually
was
a
wrongful-death
statute
which
gave
to
the
dependents
a
right
to
--
and
then
to
cover
that
whole
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
an
independent
right
of
action
which
did
however
depend
upon
the
existence
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
of
a
right
at
the
time
of
death,
at
the
time
of
death.
and
in
the
carol
case
which
is
a
case
from
the
supreme
court,
the
court
said
the
two
can
be
merged
if
the
first
has
not
been
extinguished,
then
it
can
be
merged
into
the
claim
of
the
dependents,
but
they
are
two
separate
cause
of
action.
we
prefer
for
clarity
to
try
to
distinguish
between
a
survival
action
which
perhaps
half
of
the
states
have,
which
enables
the
representative
of
the
decedent
to
carry
on
the
claims
that
he
has
sustained
during
his
lifetime.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
exactly.
but
there's
–-
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
whereas
the
wrong
--
the
true
wrongful-death
act
which
is
the
lord
campbell
act
(voice
overlap)
in
which
every
state
has
is
the
right
of
the
dependents
to
sue
for
their
damages
which
have
occurred
of
course
after
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
for
the
loss.
yes,
sir.
but
the
lord
campbell’s
act
which
was,
you
might
say
the
original
true
wrongful-death
act
said
that
says
it
is
a
derivative
action
which
goes
back
to
the
initial
--
the
original
tort
that
in
order
for
the
dependents
to
exercise
their
cause
of
action
after
the
death
of
the
decedent,
there
had
to
be
in
existence
at
the
time
of
death
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
decedent
himself
to
sue
for
his
damages.
and
if
he
extinguished
that
right
in
some
manner
this
extinguishes
the
separate
right
of
the
dependents.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
i
believe
there
was
and
i
am
sure
counsel
would
bring
this
out
his
arguments.
the
award
was
a
$175,000.00
and
the
injury
was
a
back
injury.
he’d
had
surgery.
the
psychiatrist
did
said
that
it
had
created
emotional
problems
that
he'd
become
addicted
to
his
own
medication.
he
was
having
a
drug
addiction
problem
and
he
was
severely
emotionally
disturbed
and
he
was
about
45
year-old
man
at
the
time.
approximate
20-year
work
life
expectancy,
evidence
was
submitted
as
to
his
total
inability
to
work
for
life.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir,
this
was
a
contention
of
course,
being
a
jury
award,
there
was
no
breakdown
in
the
award
as
to
what
portion.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir,
yes,
they
did.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
no,
your
honor.
no
sir
because
of
the
desire
of
all
the
courts
to
bring
it
into
litigation
and
when
the
matter
was
--
was
the
evidence
was
produced
that
its
initial
trial,
it
anticipated
everything
that
would
happen
to
him.
now
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
we
submit
that
the
claim
of
the
dependent
--but
now
he
dies
and
the
impression
is
to
his
--
what
if
any
additional
cause
of
action
do
his
dependents
have
for
his
wrongful-death
attributable
to
that
same
tortuous
injury.
we
submit
your
honor,
that
since
it
is
a
derivative
right
which
goes
back
to
the
original
tort
and
must
continue
in
a
viable
state
until
the
death
that
the
judgment,
even
though
it
may
have
been
inadequate,(inaudible)
and
the
dependents,
small
children
perhaps
with
many
years
of
dependency
are
precluded
from
making
any
claim.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
well,
under
the
general
maritime
law,
under
the
law,
no,
under
the
statutes,
no
and
the
courts
of
course
have
gone
into
states
statutes
and
gone
into
the
state,
wrongful-death
and
to
the
state
survival
statutes.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir
and
of
course
loss
of
support
is
a
very
large
item
of
--
in
a
wrongful-death
claim,
in
the
event
that
death
has
occurred
almost
immediately
with
the
accident.
then
the
dependents
have
a
very
large
claim
for
the
loss
of
support.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
this
is
true.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
there
would
be
two
cause
of
action.
his
own
cause
of
action
would
survive
and
would
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
into
the
widow
or
representative.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
and
then,
there
would
come
into
existence
at
the
time
of
death,
a
wrongful-death
action
for
the
dependents
for
their
loss
of
the
loved
one.
there
would
be
two
causes
of
action,
but
there
was
only
one
wrong,
the
initial
accident.
the
courts
have
not
looked,
excuse
me,
at
the
death
as
a
wrong.
they
have
looked
at
it
more
as
an
item
of
damages
that
flowed
from
the
initial
wrong.
and
so
when
the
claim
of
the
decedent
has
been
extinguished
and
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
wrong,
the
courts
have
said
that
the
death
does
not
bring
into
existence
a
cause
of
action
--
it's
not
new
tort,
it's
just
an
element
of
damage.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
no,
sir,
they
may
be
merged
and
one
merged
die
in
the
carol
case
which
is
a
supreme
court
case
and
which
are
commonly
merged.
commonly
merged
when
death
occurs
shortly
after
the
accident
or
simultaneously
with
it,
of
course
if
it
is
a
simultaneous
death,
an
instantaneous
death,
there
would
be
no
survival
action.
yes
sir?
if
--
say
a
seaman
sues
for
injuries
under
the
jones
act
and
that
occurred
on
the
high
seas?
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
there
is
a
survival
--
well,
in
your
question
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
then
we
submit
that
he
would
have
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
we
don’t
have
holdings
on
jones
act,
your
honor.
we
don’t.
all
of
the
holdings
under
fela.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
let’s
see,
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
if
he
had
recovered
during
his
lifetime,
there
are
no
cases
under
death
on
the
high
seas
act
as
we
see
the
--
they
are
all
under
fela.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
actually
on
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
rule
is
rather
harsh.
it
says
that
if
the
injured
man
had
a
suit
underway
so
to
speak
and
he
dies,
then
all
of
his
claims
for
pain
and
suffering
are
extinguished.
it
cannot
be
passed
on
to
his
heirs
but
they
do
get
the
wrongful-death
claim
for
their
loss,
but
his
funeral
expenses
and
pain
and
suffering
claim
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
we
don’t
have
any
cases
under
death
of
the
high
seas
act.
but
if
it
is
a
result
of
the
fela
which
is
what
death
on
the
high
seas
is
change
from
the
(inaudible).
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
you’re
correct,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
then,
we
do
not
have
cases
and
we
do
not
know
of
cases
which
have
dealt
with
this
problem.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
did
not
include.
well,
no
service,
the
pain
and
suffering
would
be
the
decedents
of
the
claim.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
and
also
they
do
not.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
just
pecuniary
loss
on
the
death
on
the
high
seas.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
and
under
--
in
the
cases
since
moragne
except
for
a
louisiana
case,
there
has
been
only
recovery
for
pecuniary
loss.
we
will
reserve
the
rest
of
our
time.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
briefly
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir.
the
moragne
case
was
decided
to
provide
a
remedy
where
there
was
none
and
where
the
harshness
of
the
harrisburg
had
been
in
effect
made
a
mockery
out
of
it
over
the
years
by
various
bypass
procedures.
and
so
in
moragne
where
there
was
virtually
an
instantaneous
death,
a
widow
and
no
remedy
--
the
remedy
was
supplied
but
the
case
before
the
court
today
is
not
one
in
which
there
is
no
remedy.
the
remedy
was
perceived
and
the
fifth
circuit
points
out
the
problem
which
will
be
created
by
portion
one
of
the
damages
to
go
back
into
the
jury
award
and
try
to
determine
which
of
these
damages
where
anticipatory
of
the
death
or
of
the
loss
of
income
of
mr.
gaudet
in
the
footnote
on
page
4
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
again,
we
would
simply
point
out
that
the
fact
that
the
right
is
derivative
rather
than
representative,
is
in
our
opinion
the
crux
of
the
question
before
the
court.
if
the
original
tort
give
rise
to
two
causes
of
action
potentially,
then,
the
occurrence
of
the
death
is
not
that
which
creates
the
right
of
the
dependents
to
bring
their
action.
it's
the
original
tort
and
if
this
is
extinguished
by
the
injured
man
during
his
life,
the
courts
have
said
that
this
--
he
had
received
his
pecuniary
loss
and
you'are
opening
a
pandora’s
box
to
go
and
in
fact
to
carry
it
over.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
it
has
been
in
all
of
the
cases
your
honor.
well,
know.
nis
that
construction
of
the
statute
or
just
--
it
was
not
in
the
statute
--
statute.
no,
it
was
and
the
statute
just
set
damages
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
it
came
through
fela
and
it's
a
--
but
the
statute
set
damages.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
this
is
the
hiatus.
this
is
the
area
where
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir,
and
these
were
the
several
points
--
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir,
these
were
several
of
the
points
in
our
brief.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir,
whether
to
maintain
uniformity,
you’re
going
to
follow
what
has
been
done
in
the
other
act?
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
no,
sir,
that's
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
sir.
it
is
a
question
of
compensation.
it
is
a
question
of
extinguishing
the
act
--
the
action
before
the
death
occurred.
it’s
scenario
were
--
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
a
true
counterpart
or
a
comparable
situation.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
it
is
the
love,
the
affection
and
relationship
of
the
husband
and
wife.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes,
it
is.
mr.
stuart
a.
mcclendon
yes
sir.
thank
you,
your
honor.
