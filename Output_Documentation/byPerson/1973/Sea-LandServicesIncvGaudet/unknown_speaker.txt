unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclendon,
you
indicated
that
mrs.
gaudet
inherited
the
estate
of
her
husband?
unknown
speaker
supposed
this
were
not
the
case
and
i
take
that
this
could
be
possible
in
louisiana,
i
do
not
know,
but
if
this
were
a
child,
if
there
were
no
widow
or
something,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
statement
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wondered
whether
there
was
any
legal
significance
in
the
fact
that
she
had
inherited
it.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
theory,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
does
not
depend
on
the
fact
of
inheritance.
that's
--
this
is
what
i
wish
to
be
assured
about.
suppose
there
were
no
widows,
supposed
mr.
gaudet
have
--
was
a
widower,
i
take
it
--
in
louisiana,
you
have
wrongful-death
of
possibilities
at
least
for
surviving
minor
children?
unknown
speaker
we’d
still
have
a
problem,
would
we
not?
unknown
speaker
alright
then.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclendon,
i
haven’t
thought
about
this
for
a
good
many
years
but
i
remember
there
are
two
different
basic
kinds
of
wrongful-death
actions.
one
is
lord
campbell’s
type,
the
lord
campbell’s
act
type
in
which
the
survivors
inherit
the
cause
of
action
that
the
decedent
would've
had,
and
then
there
is
a
quite
a
different
kind
of
statutory
action
which
the
survivors
have
given
an
independent
cause
of
action
for
the
death
of
the
decedent.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
about
that?
unknown
speaker
and
then
there
may
be
some
merged
classifications
somewhere
in
between
those
two
theoretical
causes
of
action
and
wouldn’t
it
depend
here
on
which
--
would
the
answer
to
the
problem
in
this
case
depend
upon
which
kind
of
wrongful-death
action
we've
--
the
court
was
talking
about
in
moragne?
unknown
speaker
or
moragne
as
it
sometimes
called?
unknown
speaker
an
independent
right
of
action?
unknown
speaker
of
a
right
of
action
by
the
decedent.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
a
survival
--
that's
the
inheritance
of
the
cause
of
action
that
the
decedent
had?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
another
theory.
unknown
speaker
for
the
loss
of
the
decedent
by
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
manner
of
damages?
now
in
this
--
now
in
the
original
action
here
by
the
decedent
was
it
shown
indisputably
that
there
was
total
and
permanent
disability?
unknown
speaker
total
and
permanent
disability?
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
the
defendant
disputed
that?
unknown
speaker
i'm
thinking
of
a
case,
let
us
take
a
case.
the
facts
in
this
case
really
are
not
all
that
--
they're
spelled
out
but
state
case
of
a
tortuous
injury,
personal
injury
that
appears
at
the
time
of
the
award
by
a
jury
to
the
injured
party
to
be
partial
permanent
disability,
let’s
say?
and
then
the
award
is
made
and
then
the
man
a
month
after
the
award
gets
complications
which
are
concededly
and
directly
attributable
to
this
personal
injuries,
and
he
then
dies
in
a
year.
and
now,
it
is
very
clear
that
he
is
a
total
loss
to
his
dependents
as
far
his
earning
power
goes,
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action
then
for
this
wrongful-death
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
to
him?
now,
i
know
that
it
is
very
clearly,
he
couldn't
bring
any
lawsuit
to
say,
well,
look
the
--
i
wish
the
jury
was
wrong
and
the
evidence
was
wrong,
i
fully
understand
that
that
is
common
place
he
can’t
bring
any
lawsuit.
his
lawsuit
is
settled,
rightly
or
wrongly.
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
elements
of
damage?
in
his
own
lawsuit,
of
course,
he
can
recover
i
assume
for
things
like
his
own
pain
and
suffering.
unknown
speaker
can
his
dependents
in
a
wrongful-death
action
recover
for
his
pain
and
suffering?
unknown
speaker
but
they
can
recover
on
the
other
hand
for
their
lawsuit
for
the
widow
can
recover
perhaps
--
you
say
not
in
maritime
law,
but
that’s
the
question,
but
there
might
be
other
elements
of
damage?
unknown
speaker
as
contrasted
to
his
pain
and
suffering
for
which
they
perhaps
could
not
recover,
they
could
on
the
other
hand
recover
for
their
lawsuit,
companionship
and
consortium?
unknown
speaker
loss
of
support.
but
it
should
would
be
less
maybe
than
his
own
cause
of
action
if
he
were
indeed
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
his
loss
of
earnings
would
be
greater
because
they
would
--
that
loss
would've
had
to
supported
him
during
the
balance
of
his
life,
and
now
he
is
dead?
unknown
speaker
yes
sir?
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
dies,
is
there
an
action
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
there?
unknown
speaker
on
example
of
whom?
unknown
speaker
in
the
access,
who
may
recover
right?
unknown
speaker
does
it
also
--
what
about
--
what
if
the
seaman
had
already
recovered
from
the
death
of
the
high
seas
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
submit
but
are
there
holdings?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
not
a
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
said
on
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
congress
has
not
made
it
a
precondition
that
a
cause
of
action
exist
at
the
time
of
death?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
he’s
already
recovered?
got
a
judgment?
unknown
speaker
jones
act
incorporates
fela,
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
something
else?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
involve
seaman?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
the
event
there
is
an
action,
the
elements
of
recovery
are
pecuniary
only?
unknown
speaker
a
survivor,
assuming
he
does
have
a
good
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
actually,
if
the
elements
who
is
damaged
do
not
include
pain
and
suffering
--
unknown
speaker
i
--
so
again,
i
ask
you,
does
not
conclude
the
damage
to
the
heirs
do
not
include
pain
and
suffering?
unknown
speaker
just
pecuniary.
unknown
speaker
and
the
same
is
true
under
the
--
unknown
speaker
under
the
jones
act.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
he
is
a
major
and
not
a
minor
or
is
he
major
in
the
army?
unknown
speaker
life
status.
unknown
speaker
life
status,
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
and
maybe
not,
yeah,
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
ask
mr.
reese,
if
this
judgment
which
he
recovered
includes
an
award
for
impaired
earnings
for
the
rest
of
his
life?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
what
i’m
trying
get
at
is
whether
they
went
to
the
jury
as
an
element
of
his
damages,
an
item
of
an
impaired
earnings
that
hereafter
instead
of
earning
$200.00
and
then
hope
to
earn
not
more
than
$50.00
a
week
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
actuarially
his
life
span
is
now
going
to
be
“x”
years?
unknown
speaker
so
that
--
so
then
--
that
in
terms
of
his
impaired
earning
ability?
unknown
speaker
and
so
there
is
a
misdamage
award,
an
element
of
a
compensation
for
impaired
earning
ability.
unknown
speaker
now,
that's
a
--
well,
if
that’s
true,
why
doesn’t
that
take
care
of
the
--
any
dependent’s
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
went
to
them
as
considered,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
they
were
told
to
consider
that
element,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
claim
of
dependency
would
his
wife
and
children
have?
unknown
speaker
why
doesn’t
it
have?
you
mean
under
louisiana,
it
doesn’t
have
any?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
theory
is
that,
then
all
the
members
of
the
family
together
can
recover
more
than
just
what
a
jury
would
award
for
loss
of
earnings
that
they
can
in
effect
duplicate
that
role
--
that
award
in
some
--
unknown
speaker
this
case
hasn’t
gone
to
trial
yet
in
the
court?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
still
have
to
go
to
trial,
i
mean
--
are
you
suggesting
now
that
it
might
become
an
issue
of
how
much
of
a
$175,000.00
is
to
be
credited
against
any
case
that
she
establishes
of
damages
as
dependents,
is
it
that?
unknown
speaker
how
are
can
going
to
breakdown
a
$175,000.00?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
theory,
i
take
it
that
the
defendant
can
be
required
to
pay
more
by
way
of
loss
of
earnings
then
the
first
jury
determined
the
plaintiff,
they
were
entitled
to
recover,
taking
both
suits
together?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
get
over
the
analysis
in
mellon
and
goodyear?
i
--
we
realize
that
was
a
fela
case
but
the
(inaudible)
was
a
settlement.
unknown
speaker
it
was
held
at
that
barred
on
the
claim
with
the
dependents
because
the
settlement
had
to
be
taken
to
have
included
any
dependency
claims.
well,
how
is
this
different?
unknown
speaker
that
is
alright.
unknown
speaker
so,
are
you
suggesting
that
for
purposes
of
moragne
and
for
the
people
who
will
get
the
benefit
of
the
moragne
decision
that
we
not
be
guided
by
what
the
congress
has
said.
the
rule
should
be
with
respect
to
seaman
or
with
respect
to
the
people
having
the
benefit
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act?
unknown
speaker
and
that
we
should
not
adopt
what
congress’
thought
should
be
available
to
seaman’s
survivors?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
must
say
though,
ordinarily
in
framing
admiralty
rules,
we
have
consulted
what
congress
has
done
in
cognate
situations,
haven't
we?
unknown
speaker
and
there
were
indications
in
moragne
also
that
perhaps
the
court
should
look
to
those
congressional
guidance.
unknown
speaker
in
--
on
this
very
subject.
unknown
speaker
wouldn’t
the
--
wouldn't
it
help
your
case
considerably
if
the
elements
of
damage
under
--
for
those
who
can
have
advantage
of
moragne,
were
not
limited
to
pecuniary
loss?
unknown
speaker
if
mellon
and
that
minor
cases,
if
they
haven’t
assumed
or
held
or
been
limited
to
pecuniary
loss,
it
may
be
that
precondition
of
cause
of
action
wouldn’t
have
obtained?
unknown
speaker
that
might
make
some
sense
if,
as
long
as
you
assume
that
the
or
as
long
as
you
hold
that
the
damages
recoverable
by
the
survivor
are
limited
to
pecuniary
loss?
now,
where
did
that
little
--
come
from,
that
the
survivors
under
the
jones
act
and
death
on
the
high
seas
and
fela
if
the
damages
of
survivors
are
limited
to
pecuniary?
unknown
speaker
that's
rule
of
lord
campbell’s
tom?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
a
widow
did
could
recover
for
consortium,
the
loss
of
consortium?
it
wouldn’t
make
much
sense
would
it
--
to
say
that
the
recovery
by
the
decedent
extinguished
the
--
would've
cause
of
action
--
really
what
made
my
attempt
was
--
unknown
speaker
make
more
sense
and
make
some
sense
if
you
talk
about
the
when
you
talk
about
pecuniary
loss.
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
this
consortium.
unknown
speaker
now
moragne,
so
we'd
feel
--
i
supposed
part
of
our
problem
is,
what
are
the
elements
of
damages
available
under
moragne?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
the
widow
was
not
a
party
to
his
lawsuit
alleging
a
loss
of
consortium,
was
she?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
still
uncompensated,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
was
their
relation
of
the
claim
for
loss
of
consortium?
unknown
speaker
if
common
law
it
could
be
--
unknown
speaker
we
are
in
civil
law
state
by
you’re
right
sir,
this
is
true.
unknown
speaker
well
of
course,
in
the
area,
we're
dealing
with
today
--
we're
framing
the
federal
admiralty
rule.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclendon,
you
indicated
that
mrs.
gaudet
inherited
the
estate
of
her
husband?
unknown
speaker
supposed
this
were
not
the
case
and
i
take
that
this
could
be
possible
in
louisiana,
i
do
not
know,
but
if
this
were
a
child,
if
there
were
no
widow
or
something,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
statement
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wondered
whether
there
was
any
legal
significance
in
the
fact
that
she
had
inherited
it.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
theory,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
does
not
depend
on
the
fact
of
inheritance.
that's
--
this
is
what
i
wish
to
be
assured
about.
suppose
there
were
no
widows,
supposed
mr.
gaudet
have
--
was
a
widower,
i
take
it
--
in
louisiana,
you
have
wrongful-death
of
possibilities
at
least
for
surviving
minor
children?
unknown
speaker
we’d
still
have
a
problem,
would
we
not?
unknown
speaker
alright
then.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclendon,
i
haven’t

about
this
for
a

i

and
that's
a

that's
the

of
the

that

unknown

but
there
is
another

for
the

by
then?

how

and
suffering
for
which
they
perhaps
could
not
recover,
they
could
on
the
other
hand
recover
for
their
lawsuit,
companionship
and
consortium?
unknown
speaker
loss
of
support.
but
it
should
would
be
less
maybe
than
his
own
cause
of
action
if
he
were
indeed
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
his
loss
of
earnings
would
be
greater
because
they
would
--
that
loss
would've
had
to
supported
him
during
the
balance
of
his
life,
and
now
he
is
dead?
unknown
speaker
yes
sir?
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
dies,
is
there
an
action
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
there?
unknown
speaker
on
example
of
whom?
unknown
speaker
in
the
access,
who
may
recover
right?
unknown
speaker
does
it
also
--
what
about
--
what
if
the
seaman
had
already
recovered
from
the
death
of
the
high
seas
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
submit
but
are
there
holdings?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
not
a
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
said
on
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
congress
has
not
made
it
a
precondition
that
a
cause
of
action
exist
at
the
time
of
death?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
he’s
already
recovered?
got
a
judgment?
unknown
speaker
jones
act
incorporates
fela,
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
something
else?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
involve
seaman?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
the
event
there
is
an
action,
the
elements
of
recovery
are
pecuniary
only?
unknown
speaker
a
survivor,
assuming
he
does
have
a
good
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
actually,
if
the
elements
who
is
damaged
do
not
include
pain
and
suffering
--
unknown
speaker
i
--
so
again,
i
ask
you,
does
not
conclude
the
damage
to
the
heirs
do
not
include
pain
and
suffering?
unknown
speaker
just
pecuniary.
unknown
speaker
and
the
same
is
true
under
the
--
unknown
speaker
under
the
jones
act.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
he
is
a
major
and
not
a
minor
or
is
he
major
in
the
army?
unknown
speaker
life
status.
unknown
speaker
life
status,
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
and
maybe
not,
yeah,
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
ask
mr.
reese,
if
this
judgment
which
he
recovered
includes
an
award
for
impaired
earnings
for
the
rest
of
his
life?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
what
i’m
trying
get
at
is
whether
they
went
to
the
jury
as
an
element
of
his
damages,
an
item
of
an
impaired
earnings
that
hereafter
instead
of
earning
$200.00
and
then
hope
to
earn
not
more
than
$50.00
a
week
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
actuarially
his
life
span
is
now
going
to
be
“x”
years?
unknown
speaker
so
that
--
so
then
--
that
in
terms
of
his
impaired
earning
ability?
unknown
speaker
and
so
there
is
a
misdamage
award,
an
element
of
a
compensation
for
impaired
earning
ability.
unknown
speaker
now,
that's
a
--
well,
if
that’s
true,
why
doesn’t
that
take
care
of
the
--
any
dependent’s
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
went
to
them
as
considered,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
they
were
told
to
consider
that
element,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
claim
of
dependency
would
his
wife
and
children
have?
unknown
speaker
why
doesn’t
it
have?
you
mean
under
louisiana,
it
doesn’t
have
any?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
theory
is
that,
then
all
the
members
of
the
family
together
can
recover
more
than
just
what
a
jury
would
award
for
loss
of
earnings
that
they
can
in
effect
duplicate
that
role
--
that
award
in
some
--
unknown
speaker
this
case
hasn’t
gone
to
trial
yet
in
the
court?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
still
have
to
go
to
trial,
i
mean
--
are
you
suggesting
now
that
it
might
become
an
issue
of
how
much
of
a
$175,000.00
is
to
be
credited
against
any
case
that
she
establishes
of
damages
as
dependents,
is
it
that?
unknown
speaker
how
are
can
going
to
breakdown
a
$175,000.00?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
theory,
i
take
it
that
the
defendant
can
be
required
to
pay
more
by
way
of
loss
of
earnings
then
the
first
jury
determined
the
plaintiff,
they
were
entitled
to
recover,
taking
both
suits
together?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
get
over
the
analysis
in
mellon
and
goodyear?
i
--
we
realize
that
was
a
fela
case
but
the
(inaudible)
was
a
settlement.
unknown
speaker
it
was
held
at
that
barred
on
the
claim
with
the
dependents
because
the
settlement
had
to
be
taken
to
have
included
any
dependency
claims.
well,
how
is
this
different?
unknown
speaker
that
is
alright.
unknown
speaker
so,
are
you
suggesting
that
for
purposes
of
moragne
and
for
the
people
who
will
get
the
benefit
of
the
moragne
decision
that
we
not
be
guided
by
what
the
congress
has
said.
the
rule
should
be
with
respect
to
seaman
or
with
respect
to
the
people
having
the
benefit
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act?
unknown
speaker
and
that
we
should
not
adopt
what
congress’
thought
should
be
available
to
seaman’s
survivors?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
must
say
though,
ordinarily
in
framing
admiralty
rules,
we
have
consulted
what
congress
has
done
in
cognate
situations,
haven't
we?
unknown
speaker
and
there
were
indications
in
moragne
also
that
perhaps
the
court
should
look
to
those
congressional
guidance.
unknown
speaker
in
--
on
this
very
subject.
unknown
speaker
wouldn’t
the
--
wouldn't
it
help
your
case
considerably
if
the
elements
of
damage
under
--
for
those
who
can
have
advantage
of
moragne,
were
not
limited
to
pecuniary
loss?
unknown
speaker
if
mellon
and
that
minor
cases,
if
they
haven’t
assumed
or
held
or
been
limited
to
pecuniary
loss,
it
may
be
that
precondition
of
cause
of
action
wouldn’t
have
obtained?
unknown
speaker
that
might
make
some
sense
if,
as
long
as
you
assume
that
the
or
as
long
as
you
hold
that
the
damages
recoverable
by
the
survivor
are
limited
to
pecuniary
loss?
now,
where
did
that
little
--
come
from,
that
the
survivors
under
the
jones
act
and
death
on
the
high
seas
and
fela
if
the
damages
of
survivors
are
limited
to
pecuniary?
unknown
speaker
that's
rule
of
lord
campbell’s
tom?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
a
widow
did
could
recover
for
consortium,
the
loss
of
consortium?
it
wouldn’t
make
much
sense
would
it
--
to
say
that
the
recovery
by
the
decedent
extinguished
the
--
would've
cause
of
action
--
really
what
made
my
attempt
was
--
unknown
speaker
make
more
sense
and
make
some
sense
if
you
talk
about
the
when
you
talk
about
pecuniary
loss.
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
this
consortium.
unknown
speaker
now
moragne,
so
we'd
feel
--
i
supposed
part
of
our
problem
is,
what
are
the
elements
of
damages
available
under
moragne?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
the
widow
was
not
a
party
to
his
lawsuit
alleging
a
loss
of
consortium,
was
she?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
still
uncompensated,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
was
their
relation
of
the
claim
for
loss
of
consortium?
unknown
speaker
if
common
law
it
could
be
--
unknown
speaker
we
are
in
civil
law
state
by
you’re
right
sir,
this
is
true.
unknown
speaker
well
of
course,
in
the
area,
we're
dealing
with
today
--
we're
framing
the
federal
admiralty
rule.
