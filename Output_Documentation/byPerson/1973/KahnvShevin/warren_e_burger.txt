mrs.
ginsburg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief

warren
e.
burger
if
you’d
like
to
lower
the
lectern,
you’ve
quite
the
liberty
to
do
so
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
don’t
want
it
whether
it
helps
--
even
when
it
helps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
even
if
it
does,
you
would
assume
on
that
assumption
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
only
way
we
could
do
it
or
could
we
simply
say
the
statute
is
invalid.
if
we
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
take
the
risk
of
you,
i
am
speaking
in
broad
terms,
a
litigant
takes
the
risk
of
destroying
an
entire
statutory
scheme,
when
they
attack
it
in
this
court
as
one
of
the
risks,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we’ll
not
ask
you
to
spend
one
minute
dividing
your
argument
counsel.
we’ll
let
you
start
fresh
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
arguments
in

yesterday,
we
had
another
case
involving
all

of
millions
of

but
the
case
was
here
just
as
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mckenzie,
are
you
suggesting
that
this
is
based
on
economic
need?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
it
was
based
on
economic
need,
why
doesn’t
it
say
so
instead
of
putting
it
on
widowhood?
chief

ask
a
question.
you’re
familiar
with
the
defunis
case
to
be
argued
this
afternoon?
chief

warren
e.

this,
perhaps,
is
an
unfair
question

does
your

this
case
with
respect
to
the
florida
classifications
bear
in
any
way
on
the
