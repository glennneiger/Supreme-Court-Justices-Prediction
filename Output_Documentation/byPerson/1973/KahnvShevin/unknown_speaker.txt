unknown
speaker
actually
he
didn’t
allege
that
in
the
trial,
didn’t
he
expressly
say
he
didn’t
want
to
raise
this
federal
question
there?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
clear.
you
are
arguing
that
sex
ought
not
to
be
treated
as
a
suspect
classification?
unknown
speaker
so
it’s
suspect
class?
unknown
speaker
generally,
isn’t
it
the
fact
that
the
court
has
found
classification
to
be
suspect
when
it
involves
a
discriminatory
classification
against
a
minority
group?
unknown
speaker
is
that
accurate?
unknown
speaker
because
the
paradigm
is
race?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
minority
race?
unknown
speaker
alienage
is
another?
possibly,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
the
suspect
classification
is
not
only
with
respect
to
discriminatory
classification
against
a
minority
group,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
traditionally,
up
till
now?
unknown
speaker
and
your
point,
i
gather,
is
that
i
don’t
know
if
you
mentioned
it
but
women
first
of
all
are
not
a
minority
group,
and
secondly,
since
courts
have
been
in
the
habit
to
view
any
classification
of
women
as
beneficent
--
unknown
speaker
--
provision
of
course
should
be
on
guard
and
not
--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
insofar
as
the
statute
does
not
differentiate
among
various
widows
or
various
categories
of
widows.
it’s
very
typical
of
tax
legislation
generally,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
certainly,
the
federal
income
tax
which
gives
every
taxpayer
an
exemption
of
$750
for
each
dependent
regardless
of
his
circumstances
or
the
dependents’
circumstances.
if
he
is
below
certain
age,
he
is
certainly
very
blunt
instrument.
and
insofar
as
this
--
unknown
speaker
--
as
this
legislation
fails
to
discriminate
as
among
various
categories
of
widows,
you
don’t
really
attack
it,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
no,
my
point
was.
perhaps,
i
didn’t
express
it
very
well.
you,
a
few
moments
ago,
spoke
and
said
that
the
legislation
is
applicable
whether
the
widow
be
a
millionairess
or
whether
she
be
a
poor
working
widow
or
whether
she
had
children
or
no
children,
and
so
on.
i
didn’t
really
understand
that
your
basic
attack
upon
this
legislation
was
premised
upon
that
fact.
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
think
so.
unknown
speaker
of
course
if
everybody
–
if
the
end
result
is
that
everybody
is
the
exemption
that’s
the
same
as
nobody
getting
an
exemption.
unknown
speaker
many
more
widows
than
widowers.
unknown
speaker
my
brother
marshall
suggests
that
is
the
question
ultimately
up
to
the
supreme
court
and/or
legislature
of
florida.
unknown
speaker
unlike
frontiero
in
that
respect.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
ginsburg,
pursuing
this
discussion,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
florida
court
would
have
not
only
authority
but
i
think
on
page
26
of
your
brief
you
said
it’s
a
responsible
court
it
would
in
effect
rewrite
this
statute
contrary
to
what
you
concede
to
be
as
plain
language
and
intent
that
a
court
would
do
that
rather
than
the
florida
legislation?
unknown
speaker
i
might
agree
with
that.
excuse
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
going
to
say
i
could
be
persuaded,
i
think,
to
agree
that
it
would
be
more
constructive
if
you
prevail
here
for
the
legislation
in
the
end
to
equalize
it.
but
i
was
curious
by
your
suggestion
that
the
court
itself
could
rewrite
a
perfectly
plain
statute
conceded
by
you
to
be
plain.
unknown
speaker
we
gone
that
far
but
i
didn’t
know
it
gone
that
far?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
he
suggest
in
welsh
but
--
unknown
speaker
--
this
court
has
never
done
that,
has
it?
that
was
his
point
of
view?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
that
was
the
fifth
vote
in
determining
this.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
definitely,
i
gather
you
recognize.
you
suggested
at
page
25
of
your
brief
that
if
we
agree
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
that
we
should
remand
for
consideration
whether
consistent
with
the
dominant
legislative
purpose
constitutional
infirmity
this
should
be
remedied
by
holding
the
exemption
available
to
all
widowed
property
owners.
we
wouldn’t
do
that
but
we
only
would
do
--
unknown
speaker
it
will
be
simply
remand
from
proceedings
not
inconsistent
--
unknown
speaker
--
without
making
any
suggestion.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
or
that
a
minor
repair
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i’m
sure
you’d
rather
that
it
weren’t.
