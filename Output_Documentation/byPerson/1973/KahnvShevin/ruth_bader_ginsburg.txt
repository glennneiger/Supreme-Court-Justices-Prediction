may
it
please
the
court.
appellant
mel
kahn,
a
florida
resident
is
a
widower.
in
january
1971,
based
on
his
status
as
a
surviving
spouse,
he
applied
to
the
dade
county
tax
assessor
for
a
property
tax
exemption.
the
statute
under
which
widower
kahn
sought
exemption
provided,
a
widow,
along
with
the
disabled
persons
is
entitled
to
exempt
$500
yearly
from
her
property
tax.
mel
khan
was
denied
the
claimed
exemption
solely
on
the
ground
of
his
sex.
requesting
judicial
review,
he
alleged
that
the
statute
under
which
he
claimed
exemption
have
been
interpreted
and
applied
in
conflict
with
the
equal
protection
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
original
complaint,
he
suggested
that
he
might
save
at
the
federal
question
till
a
later
time
but
then
the
federal
question
was
raised
and
decided
with
the
agreement
of
all
parties.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
apparently,
with
the
understanding
of
the
court
and
the
agreement
of
both
sides,
the
federal
question
was
heard
and
decided
both
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
appellant
sought
a
declaration
that
the
exemption
provision
is
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
excludes
widowers.
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
court
of
first
instance
held
that
the
statute
by
according
exemption
to
all
widows
and
excluding
all
widowers
discriminated
arbitrarily
between
widowed
persons
and
therefore
violated
the
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
state
and
federal
constitution.
on
appeal,
the
florida
supreme
court
reversed.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
distinction
between
surviving
spouses
though
based
solely
on
gender
did
not
deny
to
any
person
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
it
is
appellant’s
position
that
the
gender
based
distinction
upheld
by
the
florida
supreme
court
discriminates
invidiously
in
two
respects.
first,
most
obviously,
it
discriminates
against
men
who
have
lost
their
wives
more
subtly
but
as
surely
it
discounts
the
contribution
made
to
the
marital
unit
and
the
family
academy
by
the
female
partner
for
her
death,
occasions
no
exemption
for
the
surviving
spouse.
by
defining
the
exempt
person
as
widow,
rather
than
surviving
spouse,
this
provision
now
covering
the
blind
and
the
totally
disabled
along
with
the
widow
is
keen
to
a
classification
delineated
by
the
president
of
one
of
our
nation’s
leading
educational
institutions.
anticipating
an
increase
in
conscription
not
too
many
years
ago,
this
distinguished
educator
complained,
“we
shall
be
left
with
the
blind,
the
lame,
and
the
women.”
this
court’s
decision
in
reed
v.
reed
404
u.s.
and
its
judgment
in
frontiero
v.
richardson
411
u.s.
indicate
genuine
concern
to
analyze
sex
classifications
free
from
the
generalizations
of
the
victorian
age.
appellant
maintains
that
the
reed
standard
is
not
met
by
a
surviving
spouse,
tax
exemption
that
uses
gender
as
the
sole
criterion
for
qualification
or
if
need
is
the
concern
then
sex
should
not
be
a
substitute
for
an
income
test.
and
if
widowed
state
is
the
concern,
then
it
is
irrational
to
distinguish
between
taxpayers
based
on
their
sex.
far
from
constituting
a
rational
shorthand
but
distinguishing
between
taxpayers
on
the
basis
of
need
or
life
situation.
a
widow’s
only
classification
is
a
crude
device
that
originated
in
and
today
perpetuates
victorian
assumptions
concerning
the
station
of
men
and
women.
to
resolve
this
case,
the
court
need
not
go
beyond
the
scrutiny
employed
in
reed
and
followed
by
the
tenth
circuit
in
moritz
v.
commissioner
469
f.
2d.
the
decision
in
reed
and
the
judgment
in
frontiero
indicate
the
court’s
clear
willingness
to
give
sex
classifications
more
than
surface
examination.
however,
if
the
court
wants
to
consider
application
of
a
suspect
classification
doctrine
then
it
must
face
the
fact
that
problems
of
race
and
sex
discrimination
are
often
different
and
that
neither
women
nor
blacks
are
aided
by
lumping
the
two
together
for
all
purposes.
thus
far,
this
court
has
applied
the
label
suspect
classification
only
in
opinions
involving
discrimination,
hostile
to
groups
not
dominant
in
society.
but
whatever
may
be
said
for
a
one-way
suspect
classification
doctrine
in
cases
involving
racial
discrimination,
a
one-way
approach
in
sex
discrimination
cases
would
be
fought
with
danger
for
women
because
of
the
historic
tendency
of
jurors
to
rationalize
any
special
treatment
of
women
as
benignly
in
their
favor.
with
respect
to
race,
the
effects
of
officially
sanctioned
segregation
are
still
very
much
with
us
but
complex
doctrines
directed
to
the
continuing
impact
of
racial
segregation
are
not
necessarily
applicable
to
sex
discrimination.
the
difference
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
with
respect
to
the
educational
experience.
most
public
education
is
co-educational
though
females
have
been
segregated
and
restricted
in
some
areas,
most
notably
vocational
training
and
athletics.
but
generally,
females
participate
with
males
in
academic
programs,
in
elementary
and
high
school
and
in
fact,
tend
to
do
better
there
than
males.
for
many
females,
this
record
of
achievement
continues
into
college
and
university.
for
example,
females
outscore
males
on
the
law
school
admissions
test.
the
problem
for
women
is
that
along
the
way,
an
attitude
is
instilled
insidiously.
this
attitude
is
described
in
a
nutshell
in
graffiti
etched
on
a
college
library
carrel
in
the
early
1950s.
the
epigram
reads,
“study
hard,
get
good
grades,
get
your
degree,
get
married,
have
three
kids,
die,
and
be
buried.”
from
the
first
drop
line,
the
sex
of
the
writer
is
impossible
to
determine
from
the
second,
her
sex
is
impossible
to
mistake.
to
cure
the
problem,
thought
so
acutely
by
the
young
woman
who
wrote
those
words
and
so
many
others
like
her,
the
law
must
stop
using
sex
as
a
shorthand
for
functional
description.
it
must
deal
with
the
parent
not
the
mother,
with
the
homemaker
not
the
housewife,
and
with
the
surviving
spouse
not
the
widow.
to
appreciate
the
character
of
the
challenged
classification,
the
widow’s
only
exemption
must
be
viewed
in
historical
context.
the
exemption
became
part
of
florida’s
law
in
1885.
at
that
time,
indeed,
well
into
the
20th
century,
florida
law
routinely
differentiated
between
the
roles
of
men
and
women
and
particularly
married
men
and
married
women.
women
could
not
vote
nor
did
they
serve
on
juries
for
example.
well,
past
the
middle
of
the
20th
century,
in
fact
up
till
1968,
a
florida
married
woman
could
not
transfer
even
her
own
interest
in
real
property
without
her
husband’s
consent.
not
surprisingly,
the
married
woman
was
deemed
worthy
of
special
solicitude.
on
the
death
of
the
person,
the
law
regarded
as
her
guardian,
her
superior
not
her
peer.
while
the
widows
only
exemption
was
designed
with
the
19th
century
status
of
married
woman
in
mind.
the
florida
supreme
court
found
contemporary
justification
for
it
in
this
unquestionable
fact.
women
workers
as
a
class
do
not
earn
as
much
as
man.
this
well
known
and
still
wide
earnings
gap
according
to
the
florida
supreme
court
supplies
a
fair
and
substantial
basis
for
the
tax
classification
widow
rather
than
surviving
spouse.
but
beyond
doubt,
a
widow’s
only
exemption
has
no
impact
whatever
on
the
conditions
responsible
for
the
earnings
gap.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
am
arguing
that
if
first,
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
deal
with
that
question
in
this
case.
but
second,
that
if
sex
is
treated
as
a
suspect
classification
which
i
think
properly
it
is,
then
the
court
must
be
aware
that
the
arguments
that
we
give
special
scrutiny
only
to
lines
that
appear
to
disfavoring
women
will
be
ultimately
harmful
to
women
because
the
history
has
been
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
the
classification.
it
is
the
criterion
sex
that
is
suspect.
not
female
but
the
criterion
sex.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
court’s
precedent,
the
suspect
label
has
been
used
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
national
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
and
what
was
looked
at
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
alienage,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is
how
it
has
been
used
in
this
court’s
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
my
point
is
that
the
women
–
what
will
aid
woman
most
is
not
looking
to
see
whether
a
classification
is
benign
or
invidious
but
whether
it
is
a
sex
criterion,
as
a
shorthand
for
what
should
be
a
functional
criteria.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
is
if
it
ever
does
one.
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
have
not
yet
found
any
such
classification
in
the
law
that
genuinely
helps
from
the
very
short-sided
view
point
perhaps
such
as
this
one?
yes.
but
long
run?
no.
i
think
that
what
women
need
is
first
of
all
a
removal
of
exclusions
and
restricted
(inaudible).
they
are
the
only
population
group
that
today
still
faces
outright
exclusions
and
restrictive
(inaudible)
and
then
what
is
necessary
is
the
welcome
sign.
a
notice
that
in
the
professions,
in
trades
and
occupations
women
are
now
as
welcomed
as
men.
but
the
notion
that
they
need
special
favored
treatment
because
they
are
women
i
think
has
been
–
what
has
helped
to
keep
women
in
a
special
place,
and
has
kept
them
away
from
equal
opportunity
for
so
long.
in
other
words,
take
this
exemption.
it’s
not
the
purpose
of
this
exemption
to
eliminate
discrimination
against
women.
it
isn’t
the
purpose
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
pay
or
to
equalize
training,
study,
job
opportunities
for
them.
in
contrast
to
these
widows
exemption
are
measures
that
are
realistically
designed
to
promote
equal
opportunity
free
from
gender
based
discrimination,
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
for
example.
these
measures
focus
on
eliminating
sex
typing
of
this
very
order
as
the
essential
task.
nor,
can
an
exemption
of
this
kind
be
regarded
as
a
rational
welfare
measure
to
alleviate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
against
women.
as
a
welfare
measure,
supposedly
directed
to
the
authority
of
women
property
owners
to
pay
taxes,
the
exemption
is
incredibly
designed
that
encompasses
the
independently
wealthy
widow
and
at
the
same
time
it
excludes
the
women
who
encounters
perhaps
the
sharpest
discrimination.
the
female
had
a
household
who
never
marry
and
some,
the
classification
is
obviously
unrelated
to
any
biological
difference
between
men
and
women.
it
is
not
fairly
and
substantially
related
to
the
need
or
life
situation
of
the
individual
men
or
women
but
it
is
very
much
related
to
underestimation
of
the
women’s
contribution
to
the
family
economy.
significantly,
the
florida
supreme
court
on
other
days
has
demonstrated
its
understanding
of
the
very
real
and
substantial
economic
contribution
made
by
the
female
partner
whether
it’s
homemaker
to
gainful
employment
or
as
increasingly
the
case
through
productive
effort
both
in
and
outside
the
home.
in
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
the
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
classification
surviving
spouse
is
well-known
classification
in
both
state
and
federal
tax
law.
it
does
reflect
the
legislature’s
recognition
that
loss
of
a
spouse
is
a
unique
episode
in
a
person’s
life
and
i
am
not
challenging
the
classification
surviving
spouse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that’s
right.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
tax
assessor
call
in
each
individual
exempt
person
and
see
if
that
person
really
needs
the
exemption,
not
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
sex
criterion
is
invalid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
well,
if
this
court
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mel
khan
gets
the
tax
exemption
for
the
tax
year
in
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first,
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
insofar
as
it
discriminates
against
widowers,
i
think
that,
if
you
declare
the
gender
line
unconstitutional
which
is
the
only
thing
that
the
court
has
been
requested
to
do,
then
the
florida
supreme
court
should
be
free
to
consider
where
the
total
demolition
of
this
exemption
or
repairing
it
to
fit
the
constitutional
requirements
is
preferred.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
the
future.
widower
concept
is
exemption
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
not
familiar
with
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
am
asking
this
court
to
take
the
same
approach
that
was
taken
in
frontiero
last
semester,
where
a
group
of
service
spouses,
in
that
case
husbands,
did
not
qualify
for
the
exemption
because
the
statute
excluded
them
and
all
this
court
held
was
that
the
state
was
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
excluded
that
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
ultimately
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ultimately,
of
course
that
is
a
question
for
the
florida
supreme
court
to
answer
and
it
can
answer
that
question
for
itself.
but
it
would
be
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
the
reasonable
approach
for
either
the
florida
supreme
court
or
the
florida
legislature
to
take.
there’s
a
florida
problem
here
that
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
all
widowed
persons
get
the
exemption
and
we’re
talking
about
a
very
small
addition,
since
there
are
about
four
times
as
many
widows.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--
in
florida
as
widowers
i
suppose
that
a
reasonable
legislature
looking
at
that
logic
class
and
wanting
the
exemption
for
that
logic
class
would
extend
it
to
this
much
smaller
group
by
than
(voice
overlap)
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that’s
quite
correct.
yes.
all
we
ask
of
this
court
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
ask
this
court
to
declare
the
statute
defective
in
that
it
excludes
widowers,
and
the
remaining
relief
would
be
inappropriate
question
for
the
florida
supreme
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
has
two
choices
in
that
situation.
it
can
either
nullify
the
statute
in
which
case
it
is
totally
toward
the
legislature’s
will
or
it
can
modify
the
statute
to
meet
the
constitutional
equal
protection
requirement.
if
it
guesses
the
wrong
way
in
either
direction,
the
legislature
of
course
has
the
final
word.
but
the
court
faced
with
the
question,
should
we
take
this
exemption
away
from
the
three
quarters
of
the
population,
the
widow
population
that
now
gets
it,
rather
than
extend
it
to
the
one-quarter
that
doesn’t
in
order
to
preserve
what
the
legislature
did
do.
it
seems
to
me,
it’s
eminently
more
destructive
of
the
legislative
will
to
say
that
we
remove
this
exemption
altogether
than
to
say
we’ll
keep
what
you
wanted
and
then
just
add
this
much
smaller
group.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
number
of
state
courts
have
done
just
that.
we
have
cited
small
against
feezy
(ph)
for
example.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these
were
all
cases
where
a
statute
was
constitutionally
infirm
because
of
under
inclusion.
a
group
had
been
left
out
and
then
it
was
the
court’s
choice
to
determine
whether
it
wanted
to
knock
out
the
provision
altogether
or
to
do
well
as
mr.
justice
harlan
once
pointed,
the
choice
is
between
amputation
and
a
skin
graft.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
concurring
opinion
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
will
be
my
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
exactly
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that’s
quite
so.
yes.
what
we
seek
in
this
court
is
a
declaration
of
the
gender
line
is
unconstitutional,
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
exclude
widowers,
and
then
a
remand
before
the
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
that
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
that
you
would
be
clearer
and
provide
more
precise
instruction
to
the
florida
supreme
court
if
you
said
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
excluded
widowers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
brandeis
once
made
that
point
that
when
a
taxpayer
is
in
this
situation.
that
taxpayer
cannot
be
expected
to
have
a
situation
equalize
by
asking
the
taxpayer
to
increase
the
taxes
of
others
similarly
situated.
so
that
when
a
taxpayer
is
subject
to
a
discriminatory
tax
through
favoring
others.
the
only
equalization
possible
is
to
grant
that
taxpayer
the
exemption
afforded
to
others
and
then
change
for
the
future
can
be
made
so
that
all
persons
similarly
situated
will
either
be
included
or
excluded
from
the
exemption.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it’s
the
province
of
the
florida
supreme
court
to
decide
what
should
be
done
with
that
florida
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
can
do
what
justice
brandeis
suggested
in
the
iowa-des
moines
case
284
u.s.
and
that
is
to
say
that
this
appellant
must
be
granted
the
exemption
because
there
is
no
other
way
that
his
claim
of
the
denial
of
equal
protection
can
be
redressed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn’t
a
different
kind
of
exemption
but
the
same
situation
that
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
you
wouldn’t
be
rewriting
the
statute.
you
would
be
holding
that
the
statute
contains
a
constitutional
defect
at
the
classification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
not
be
rewriting
the
statute
for
anyone
other
than
our
claimant
who
made
a
timely
claim
for
this
exemption
and
whose
denial
--
to
whom
the
denial
of
equal
protection
cannot
be
redressed
in
any
other
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
call
the
extension
of
the
statute
to
widowers
a
minor
repair.
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
necessary
repair
to
preserve
its
constitutionality.
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first,
i
would
like
to
qualify
that
mobile
homes
are
not
subject
to
the
ad
valorem
property
tax.
article
vii,
section
1
of
the
constitution
exempts,
along
with
motor
vehicles,
mobile
homes.
then,
in
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
also,
i
would
like
to
qualify
the
statement
made
that
this
tax
is
subject
--
real
property
and
personal
property
are
subject
to
this
tax.
that’s
true
in
the
constitutional
description,
but
a
statute
exempts
all
household
goods
and
all
personal
effects
for
all
persons
whether
or
not
they’re
heads
of
family,
and
that’s
florida
statute
196.181.
in
fact,
the
legislature
has
twice
extended
this
constitutional
provision
that
we’re
talking
about
by
ordinary
statute.
and
then,
finally,
with
respect
to
a
point
that
came
out
yesterday,
recent
models
for
the
disposition
that
appellant
seeks
in
this
case
include
the
per
curiam
opinion
last
term
in
new
jersey
welfare
rights
organization
against
cahill
and
early
on,
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
opinion
in
graham
against
richardson.
both
of
those
opinions
dealt
with
constitutionally
under-inclusive
state
rather
than
federal
benefit
statutes,
and
both
are
cited
at
page
27
of
our
main
brief
and
in
a
footnote
at
page
8
of
our
reply
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
at
all.
the
defunis
case
raises
a
very
different
issue.
defunis
is
a
program
of
a
law
school
that
is
designed
to
open
doors
to
equal
opportunity,
to
assure
a
law
student
body
with
diverse
backgrounds
and
experience
and
to
what
defy
the
conspicuous
absence
of
minority
groups
in
the
profession.
it
is
not
a
welfare,
though
assumed,
based
on
the
assumed
inferior
capabilities
of
any
population
group.
no
rigid
race
line
is
presented,
as
we
have
here,
a
rigid
sex
line.
race
is
merely
one
of
the
many
characteristics
assessed
in
that
case.
but
most
significantly,
defunis
involves
no
general
law
classification.
it’s
a
measure
addressed
to
very
special
selection
problem
that
law
schools
have.
law
schools
have
the
very
hard
task
of
choosing
some
from
among
many
applicants
that
are
fit
to
pursue
their
educational
program.
by
contrast,
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
law,
general
application
of
the
law
with
respect
to
property
owners
where
there
can
be
no
justification
for
the
crude
device
of
labeling
any
group:
racial,
ethnic,
or
sexual
as
needy
persons.
and,
income
tax
is
readily
available
to
a
legislature
that
wishes
to
distinguish
on
the
basis
of
need,
and
immutable
birth
characteristic
should
be
irrelevant
for
general
law
purposes.
justice
ruth

and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellant
mel
kahn,
a
florida
resident
is
a
widower.
in
january
1971,
based
on
his
status
as
a
surviving
spouse,
he
applied
to
the
dade
county
tax
assessor
for
a
property
tax
exemption.
the
statute
under
which
widower
kahn
sought
exemption
provided,
a
widow,
along
with
the
disabled
persons
is
entitled
to
exempt
$500
yearly
from
her
property
tax.
mel
khan
was
denied
the
claimed
exemption
solely
on
the
ground
of
his
sex.
requesting
judicial
review,
he
alleged
that
the
statute
under
which
he
claimed
exemption
have
been
interpreted
and
applied
in
conflict
with
the
equal
protection
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
original
complaint,
he
suggested
that
he
might
save
at
the
federal
question
till
a
later
time
but
then
the
federal
question
was
raised
and
decided
with
the
agreement
of
all
parties.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
apparently,
with
the
understanding
of
the
court
and
the
agreement
of
both
sides,
the
federal
question
was
heard
and
decided
both
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
appellant
sought
a
declaration
that
the
exemption
provision
is
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
excludes
widowers.
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
the
court
of
first
instance
held
that
the
statute
by
according
exemption
to
all
widows
and
excluding
all
widowers
discriminated
arbitrarily
between
widowed
persons
and
therefore
violated
the
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
state
and
federal
constitution.
on
appeal,
the
florida
supreme
court
reversed.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
distinction
between
surviving
spouses
though
based
solely
on
gender
did
not
deny
to
any
person
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
it
is
appellant’s
position
that
the
gender
based
distinction
upheld
by
the
florida
supreme
court
discriminates
invidiously
in
two
respects.
first,
most
obviously,
it
discriminates
against
men
who
have
lost
their
wives
more
subtly
but
as
surely
it
discounts
the
contribution
made
to
the
marital
unit
and
the
family
academy
by
the
female
partner
for
her
death,
occasions
no
exemption
for
the
surviving
spouse.
by
defining
the
exempt
person
as
widow,
rather
than
surviving
spouse,
this
provision
now
covering
the
blind
and
the
totally
disabled
along
with
the
widow
is
keen
to
a
classification
delineated
by
the
president
of
one
of
our
nation’s
leading
educational
institutions.
anticipating
an
increase
in
conscription
not
too
many
years
ago,
this
distinguished
educator
complained,
“we
shall
be
left
with
the
blind,
the
lame,
and
the
women.”
this
court’s
decision
in
reed
v.
reed
404
u.s.
and
its
judgment
in
frontiero
v.
richardson
411
u.s.
indicate
genuine
concern
to
analyze
sex
classifications
free
from
the
generalizations
of
the
victorian
age.
appellant
maintains
that
the
reed
standard
is
not
met
by
a
surviving
spouse,
tax
exemption
that
uses
gender
as
the
sole
criterion
for
qualification
or
if
need
is
the
concern
then
sex
should
not
be
a
substitute
for
an
income
test.
and
if
widowed
state
is
the
concern,
then
it
is
irrational
to
distinguish
between
taxpayers
based
on
their
sex.
far
from
constituting
a
rational
shorthand
but
distinguishing
between
taxpayers
on
the
basis
of
need
or
life
situation.
a
widow’s
only
classification
is
a
crude
device
that
originated
in
and
today
perpetuates
victorian
assumptions
concerning
the
station
of
men
and
women.
to
resolve
this
case,
the
court
need
not
go
beyond
the
scrutiny
employed
in
reed
and
followed
by
the
tenth
circuit
in
moritz
v.
commissioner
469
f.
2d.
the
decision
in
reed
and
the
judgment
in
frontiero
indicate
the
court’s
clear
willingness
to
give
sex
classifications
more
than
surface
examination.
however,
if
the
court
wants
to
consider
application
of
a
suspect
classification
doctrine
then
it
must
face
the
fact
that
problems
of
race
and
sex
discrimination
are
often
different
and
that
neither
women
nor
blacks
are
aided
by
lumping
the
two
together
for
all
purposes.
thus
far,
this
court
has
applied
the
label
suspect
classification
only
in
opinions
involving
discrimination,
hostile
to
groups
not
dominant
in
society.
but
whatever
may
be
said
for
a
one-way
suspect
classification
doctrine
in
cases
involving
racial
discrimination,
a
one-way
approach
in
sex
discrimination
cases
would
be
fought
with
danger
for
women
because
of
the
historic
tendency
of
jurors
to
rationalize
any
special
treatment
of
women
as
benignly
in
their
favor.
with
respect
to
race,
the
effects
of
officially
sanctioned
segregation
are
still
very
much
with
us
but
complex
doctrines
directed
to
the
continuing
impact
of
racial
segregation
are
not
necessarily
applicable
to
sex
discrimination.
the
difference
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
with
respect
to
the
educational
experience.
most
public
education
is
co-educational
though
females
have
been
segregated
and
restricted
in
some
areas,
most
notably
vocational
training
and
athletics.
but
generally,
females
participate
with
males
in
academic
programs,
in
elementary
and
high
school
and
in
fact,
tend
to
do
better
there
than
males.
for
many
females,
this
record
of
achievement
continues
into
college
and
university.
for
example,
females
outscore
males
on
the
law
school
admissions
test.
the
problem
for
women
is
that
along
the
way,
an
attitude
is
instilled
insidiously.
this
attitude
is
described
in
a
nutshell
in
graffiti
etched
on
a
college
library
carrel
in
the
early
1950s.
the
epigram
reads,
“study
hard,
get
good
grades,
get
your
degree,
get
married,
have
three
kids,
die,
and
be
buried.”
from
the
first
drop
line,
the
sex
of
the
writer
is
impossible
to
determine
from
the
second,
her
sex
is
impossible
to
mistake.
to
cure
the
problem,
thought
so
acutely
by
the
young
woman
who
wrote
those
words
and
so
many
others
like
her,
the
law
must
stop
using
sex
as
a
shorthand
for
functional
description.
it
must
deal
with
the
parent
not
the
mother,
with
the
homemaker
not
the
housewife,
and
with
the
surviving
spouse
not
the
widow.
to
appreciate
the
character
of
the
challenged
classification,
the
widow’s
only
exemption
must
be
viewed
in
historical
context.
the
exemption
became
part
of
florida’s
law
in
1885.
at
that
time,
indeed,
well
into
the
20th
century,
florida
law
routinely
differentiated
between
the
roles
of
men
and
women
and
particularly
married
men
and
married
women.
women
could
not
vote
nor
did
they
serve
on
juries
for
example.
well,
past
the
middle
of
the
20th
century,
in
fact
up
till
1968,
a
florida
married
woman
could
not
transfer
even
her
own
interest
in
real
property
without
her
husband’s
consent.
not
surprisingly,
the
married
woman
was
deemed
worthy
of
special
solicitude.
on
the
death
of
the
person,
the
law
regarded
as
her
guardian,
her
superior
not
her
peer.
while
the
widows
only
exemption
was
designed
with
the
19th
century
status
of
married
woman
in
mind.
the
florida
supreme
court
found
contemporary
justification
for
it
in
this
unquestionable
fact.
women
workers
as
a
class
do
not
earn
as
much
as
man.
this
well
known
and
still
wide
earnings
gap
according
to
the
florida
supreme
court
supplies
a
fair
and
substantial
basis
for
the
tax
classification
widow
rather
than
surviving
spouse.
but
beyond
doubt,
a
widow’s
only
exemption
has
no
impact
whatever
on
the
conditions
responsible
for
the
earnings
gap.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
am
arguing
that
if
first,
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
deal
with
that
question
in
this
case.
but
second,
that
if
sex
is
treated
as
a
suspect
classification
which
i
think
properly
it
is,
then
the
court
must
be
aware
that
the
arguments
that
we
give
special
scrutiny
only
to
lines
that
appear
to
disfavoring
women
will
be
ultimately
harmful
to
women
because
the
history
has
been
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
the
classification.
it
is
the
criterion
sex
that
is
suspect.
not
female
but
the
criterion
sex.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
court’s
precedent,
the
suspect
label
has
been
used
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
national
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
and
what
was
looked
at
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
alienage,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is
how
it
has
been
used
in
this
court’s
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
my
point
is
that
the
women
–
what
will
aid
woman
most
is
not
looking
to
see
whether
a
classification
is
benign
or
invidious
but
whether
it
is
a
sex
criterion,
as
a
shorthand
for
what
should
be
a
functional
criteria.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
is
if
it
ever
does
one.
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
have
not
yet
found
any
such
classification
in
the
law
that
genuinely
helps
from
the
very
short-sided
view
point
perhaps
such
as
this
one?
yes.
but
long
run?
no.
i
think
that
what
women
need
is
first
of
all
a
removal
of
exclusions
and
restricted
(inaudible).
they
are
the
only
population
group
that
today
still
faces
outright
exclusions
and
restrictive
(inaudible)
and
then
what
is
necessary
is
the
welcome
sign.
a
notice
that
in
the
professions,
in
trades
and
occupations
women
are
now
as
welcomed
as
men.
but
the
notion
that
they
need
special
favored
treatment
because
they
are
women
i
think
has
been
–
what
has
helped
to
keep
women
in
a
special
place,
and
has
kept
them
away
from
equal
opportunity
for
so
long.
in
other
words,
take
this
exemption.
it’s
not
the
purpose
of
this
exemption
to
eliminate
discrimination
against
women.
it
isn’t
the
purpose
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
pay
or
to
equalize
training,
study,
job
opportunities
for
them.
in
contrast
to
these
widows
exemption
are
measures
that
are
realistically
designed
to
promote
equal
opportunity
free
from
gender
based
discrimination,
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
for
example.
these
measures
focus
on
eliminating
sex
typing
of
this
very
order
as
the
essential
task.
nor,
can
an
exemption
of
this
kind
be
regarded
as
a
rational
welfare
measure
to
alleviate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
against
women.
as
a
welfare
measure,
supposedly
directed
to
the
authority
of
women
property
owners
to
pay
taxes,
the
exemption
is
incredibly
designed
that
encompasses
the
independently
wealthy
widow
and
at
the
same
time
it
excludes
the
women
who
encounters
perhaps
the
sharpest
discrimination.
the
female
had
a
household
who
never
marry
and
some,
the
classification
is
obviously
unrelated
to
any
biological
difference
between
men
and
women.
it
is
not
fairly
and
substantially
related
to
the
need
or
life
situation
of
the
individual
men
or
women
but
it
is
very
much
related
to
underestimation
of
the
women’s
contribution
to
the
family
economy.
significantly,
the
florida
supreme
court
on
other
days
has
demonstrated
its
understanding
of
the
very
real
and
substantial
economic
contribution
made
by
the
female
partner
whether
it’s
homemaker
to
gainful
employment
or
as
increasingly
the
case
through
productive
effort
both
in
and
outside
the
home.
in
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
the
--
justice
ruth
bader

yes.
justice

the
classification
surviving
spouse
is
well-known
classification
in
both
state
and
federal
tax
law.
it
does
reflect
the
legislature’s
recognition
that
loss
of
a
spouse
is
a
unique
episode
in
a
person’s
life
and
i
am
not
challenging
the
classification
surviving
spouse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that’s
right.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
tax
assessor
call
in
each
individual
exempt
person
and
see
if
that
person
really
needs
the
exemption,
not
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
sex
criterion
is
invalid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
well,
if
this
court
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mel
khan
gets
the
tax
exemption
for
the
tax
year
in
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first,
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
insofar
as
it
discriminates
against
widowers,
i
think
that,
if
you
declare
the
gender
line
unconstitutional
which
is
the
only
thing
that
the
court
has
been
requested
to
do,
then
the
florida
supreme
court
should
be
free
to
consider
where
the
total
demolition
of
this
exemption
or
repairing
it
to
fit
the
constitutional
requirements
is
preferred.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
the
future.
widower
concept
is
exemption
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
not
familiar
with
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
am
asking
this
court
to
take
the
same
approach
that
was
taken
in
frontiero
last
semester,
where
a
group
of
service
spouses,
in
that
case
husbands,
did
not
qualify
for
the
exemption
because
the
statute
excluded
them
and
all
this
court
held
was
that
the
state
was
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
excluded
that
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
ultimately
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ultimately,
of
course
that
is
a
question
for
the
florida
supreme
court
to
answer
and
it
can
answer
that
question
for
itself.
but
it
would
be
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
the
reasonable
approach
for
either
the
florida
supreme
court
or
the
florida
legislature
to
take.
there’s
a
florida
problem
here
that
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
all
widowed
persons
get
the
exemption
and
we’re
talking
about
a
very
small
addition,
since
there
are
about
four
times
as
many
widows.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--
in
florida
as
widowers
i
suppose
that
a
reasonable
legislature
looking
at
that
logic
class
and
wanting
the
exemption
for
that
logic
class
would
extend
it
to
this
much
smaller
group
by
than
(voice
overlap)
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that’s
quite
correct.
yes.
all
we
ask
of
this
court
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
ask
this
court
to
declare
the
statute
defective
in
that
it
excludes
widowers,
and
the
remaining
relief
would
be
inappropriate
question
for
the
florida
supreme
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
has
two
choices
in
that
situation.
it
can
either
nullify
the
statute
in
which
case
it
is
totally
toward
the
legislature’s
will
or
it
can
modify
the
statute
to
meet
the
constitutional
equal
protection
requirement.
if
it
guesses
the
wrong
way
in
either
direction,
the
legislature
of
course
has
the
final
word.
but
the
court
faced
with
the
question,
should
we
take
this
exemption
away
from
the
three
quarters
of
the
population,
the
widow
population
that
now
gets
it,
rather
than
extend
it
to
the
one-quarter
that
doesn’t
in
order
to
preserve
what
the
legislature
did
do.
it
seems
to
me,
it’s
eminently
more
destructive
of
the
legislative
will
to
say
that
we
remove
this
exemption
altogether
than
to
say
we’ll
keep
what
you
wanted
and
then
just
add
this
much
smaller
group.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
number
of
state
courts
have
done
just
that.
we
have
cited
small
against
feezy
(ph)
for
example.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these
were
all
cases
where
a
statute
was
constitutionally
infirm
because
of
under
inclusion.
a
group
had
been
left
out
and
then
it
was
the
court’s
choice
to
determine
whether
it
wanted
to
knock
out
the
provision
altogether
or
to
do
well
as
mr.
justice
harlan
once
pointed,
the
choice
is
between
amputation
and
a
skin
graft.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
concurring
opinion
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
will
be
my
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
exactly
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that’s
quite
so.
yes.
what
we
seek
in
this
court
is
a
declaration
of
the
gender
line
is
unconstitutional,
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
exclude
widowers,
and
then
a
remand
before
the
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
that
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
that
you
would
be
clearer
and
provide
more
precise
instruction
to
the
florida
supreme
court
if
you
said
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
excluded
widowers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
brandeis
once
made
that
point
that
when
a
taxpayer
is
in
this
situation.
that
taxpayer
cannot
be
expected
to
have
a
situation
equalize
by
asking
the
taxpayer
to
increase
the
taxes
of
others
similarly
situated.
so
that
when
a
taxpayer
is
subject
to
a
discriminatory
tax
through
favoring
others.
the
only
equalization
possible
is
to
grant
that
taxpayer
the
exemption
afforded
to
others
and
then
change
for
the
future
can
be
made
so
that
all
persons
similarly
situated
will
either
be
included
or
excluded
from
the
exemption.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it’s
the
province
of
the
florida
supreme
court
to
decide
what
should
be
done
with
that
florida
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
can
do
what
justice
brandeis
suggested
in
the
iowa-des
moines
case
284
u.s.
and
that
is
to
say
that
this
appellant
must
be
granted
the
exemption
because
there
is
no
other
way
that
his
claim
of
the
denial
of
equal
protection
can
be
redressed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn’t
a
different
kind
of
exemption
but
the
same
situation
that
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
you
wouldn’t
be
rewriting
the
statute.
you
would
be
holding
that
the
statute
contains
a
constitutional
defect
at
the
classification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
not
be
rewriting
the
statute
for
anyone
other
than
our
claimant
who
made
a
timely
claim
for
this
exemption
and
whose
denial
--
to
whom
the
denial
of
equal
protection
cannot
be
redressed
in
any
other
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
call
the
extension
of
the
statute
to
widowers
a
minor
repair.
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
necessary
repair
to
preserve
its
constitutionality.
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first,
i
would
like
to
qualify
that
mobile
homes
are
not
subject
to
the
ad
valorem
property
tax.
article
vii,
section
1
of
the
constitution
exempts,
along
with
motor
vehicles,
mobile
homes.
then,
in
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
also,
i
would
like
to
qualify
the
statement
made
that
this
tax
is
subject
--
real
property
and
personal
property
are
subject
to
this
tax.
that’s
true
in
the
constitutional
description,
but
a
statute
exempts
all
household
goods
and
all
personal
effects
for
all
persons
whether
or
not
they’re
heads
of
family,
and
that’s
florida
statute
196.181.
in
fact,
the
legislature
has
twice
extended
this
constitutional
provision
that
we’re
talking
about
by
ordinary
statute.
and
then,
finally,
with
respect
to
a
point
that
came
out
yesterday,
recent
models
for
the
disposition
that
appellant
seeks
in
this
case
include
the
per
curiam
opinion
last
term
in
new
jersey
welfare
rights
organization
against
cahill
and
early
on,
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
opinion
in
graham
against
richardson.
both
of
those
opinions
dealt
with
constitutionally
under-inclusive
state
rather
than
federal
benefit
statutes,
and
both
are
cited
at
page
27
of
our
main
brief
and
in
a
footnote
at
page
8
of
our
reply
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
at
all.
the
defunis
case
raises
a
very
different
issue.
defunis
is
a
program
of
a
law
school
that
is
designed
to
open
doors
to
equal
opportunity,
to
assure
a
law
student
body
with
diverse
backgrounds
and
experience
and
to
what
defy
the
conspicuous
absence
of
minority
groups
in
the
profession.
it
is
not
a
welfare,
though
assumed,
based
on
the
assumed
inferior
capabilities
of
any
population
group.
no
rigid
race
line
is
presented,
as
we
have
here,
a
rigid
sex
line.
race
is
merely
one
of
the
many
characteristics
assessed
in
that
case.
but
most
significantly,
defunis
involves
no
general
law
classification.
it’s
a
measure
addressed
to
very
special
selection
problem
that
law
schools
have.
law
schools
have
the
very
hard
task
of
choosing
some
from
among
many
applicants
that
are
fit
to
pursue
their
educational
program.
by
contrast,
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
law,
general
application
of
the
law
with
respect
to
property
owners
where
there
can
be
no
justification
for
the
crude
device
of
labeling
any
group:
racial,
ethnic,
or
sexual
as
needy
persons.
and,
income
tax
is
readily
available
to
a
legislature
that
wishes
to
distinguish
on
the
basis
of
need,
and
immutable
birth
characteristic
should
be
irrelevant
for
general
law
purposes.
