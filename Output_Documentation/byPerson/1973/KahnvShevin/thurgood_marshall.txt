justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
ginsburg,
assume
and
argue
that
being
said
--
how
do
you
get
into
relief
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
we
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
gets
any
relief
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
if
we
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
they
just
ended
and
nobody
gets
other
than
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
this
case
in
this
court
which
says
that
that’s
not
for
the
courts
to
do
the
case
of
cummings
(ph)
against
the
board
of
education
in
georgia
1914
or
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it’s
a
case
where
--
it’s
just
like
this,
you
want
to
knock
out
and
then
this
court
said
that
if
you
do
that
and
nobody
gets
anything,
that’s
not
the
proper
place
with
equity
court
to
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
court
has
plenty
of
jurisdictions
over
the
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
army?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
do
not
have
it
on
the
state
of
florida.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you’d
be
perfectly
satisfied
if
the
end
result
of
this
case
is
that
would
it
get
nothing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don’t
--
you
still
--
we
cannot
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
are
we
obliged
to
suggest
to
them
what
they
should
do
or
can
we
do
anything
more
than
hold
that
statute
unconstitutional?
can
we
do
anything
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
entirely
different
from
this
case?
the
exemption
in
that
case
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
a
member.
but
wouldn’t
we
be
rewriting
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
if
we
say
that
you
must
include
the
others.
we
wouldn’t
be
rewriting
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
necessary
repair.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
florida
give
any
other
provision
in
benefit
of
women
in
their
taxation
other
than
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
i
would
assume
that
the
widow
before
she
becomes
a
widow,
if
what
you
say
is
true,
she
suffers
a
lot
too.
does
florida
recognize
that
in
this
taxing
scheme?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
single
out
the
widows?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
our
fact
says
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
the
same
as
they
are
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
women
allowed
to
make
contracts
when
this
constitution
was
first
adopted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn’t
there
a
provision
before
then
in
the
old
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
was
just
carried
over.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
it
originally
in
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
aren’t
women
in
a
little
disposition
now
than
they
were
in
1885,
little?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
can
you
put
them
in
a
class?
i
would
assume
that
there
are
some
widows
in
the
palm
beach
area
that
are
little
better
off
than
some
widowers
in
upper
part
of
florida.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
especially
true
in
taxation
i
assume.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
of
course
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
just
trying
to
get
the
reason
for
this
singling
out.
you
agree
this
is
solely
on
sex?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
strictly,
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
way
for
a
widower
to
become
a
widow?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
no
way
for
a
widower
to
become
a
widow.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it’s
sex.
what’s
wrong
with
admitting
that
it’s
based
on
sex?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
constitution
also
that
prevented
women
from
serving
on
juries,
didn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
they
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
they’ve
been
persuaded
to
let
women
serve
on
juries,
haven’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
back
in
the
19th
century?
in
the
original
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
time
of
the
original
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
$15?
justice
thurgood
marshall
gesture.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don’t
have
many
of
those
owning
homes,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
have
many
of
those
owning
homes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
they’re
mostly
renters,
aren’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wouldn’t
be
true
up
in
the
turpentine
area.
justice
thurgood
marshall
up
in
the
turpentine
area,
up
near
the
georgia
boarder.
they
don’t
own
anything
up
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it’s
still
at
rage
from
the
lower
person
to
the
highest
anywhere
you
go.
you
admit
that
and
i
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that’s
normal
for
taxation
and,
in
some
areas,
it
is.
it’s
the
question
of
whether
it’s
normal
here
where
you
draw
the
line
on
sex.
isn’t
that
the
real
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mrs.
ginsburg,
assume
and

that
being
