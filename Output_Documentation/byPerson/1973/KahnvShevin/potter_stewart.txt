justice

as
i
understand

the

was
that

i
think,
acknowledged
that
that
wasn’t
for
us
to
do
that.
the
limit
of

here
was
to
uphold
the

to

if
it’s
invalidated,
it
would
be

what
it
will.

justice

well,
i
think
my
brother

is
referring
to
the
fact
that
widows
own
a
great
deal
of
the
property
in
the
country
but
that
is
because
there
are
many,
many,
many
more
widows
than
there
are
widowers.

it
might

so,
this
wouldn’t--
justice

the
reason
for
my
question
is,
i
was
wondering
whether
this
exemption
could
validly
be
supported
as
a

where
they
might
enable

to
keep
