mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
pretty
good,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
that
part
of
the
argument
yesterday,
i
feel
that
it’s
necessary
this
time
to
clarify
some
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
is
a
claim
by
a
widower
that
he
has
been
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law
both
by
a
mandatory,
self-executing
provision
of
a
florida
constitution
and
by
a
statute
providing
exemption
from
ad
valorem
taxation
of
properties
with
a
value
of
$500
yearly
for
widows
but
not
for
widowers.
now,
that’s
important
for
two
reasons.
one,
first
of
all,
counsel
in
argument
yesterday
stated
that
this
was
a
deduction
from
taxation.
in
fact,
it’s
not
a
deduction.
it’s
an
exemption
to
the
amount
of
$500
which,
in
dollar
terms
translated
through
the
assessment
laws
of
florida,
comes
out
to
about
a
$15
amount.
secondly,
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
we
don’t
make
a
de
minimis
argument.
i
simply
wanted
to
clarify
the
fact
that
it’s
not
a
$500
deduction
from
tax
but
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
there
is
a
difference.
the
exemption--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
exemption
is
from
the
ad
valorem
value
of
the
property.
in
other
words,
if
property
is
worth
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
makes
a
difference
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
no
legal
difference
as
far
as
this
particular
case.
i
merely
wanted
to
clarify
the
fact,
your
honor.
secondly
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it’s
a
$15-benefit
and
i
was
merely
trying
to
put
it
in
perspective.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
and
we’re
not
making
an
argument
that
the
case
should
not
be
here.
the
other
question
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
other
question
though
is
of
more
significance
and
that’s
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with,
as
i
say,
not
simply
a
statute
but
a
provision
of
the
florida
constitution.
and
this
is
significant
in
that,
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
we
know
of
no
case
providing
for
this
court
or
the
florida
court
to
expand
a
provision
of
the
constitution
to
include
members
of
a
class
who
are
not
included
in
the
class
where
there
is
no
ambiguity,
and
i
think
that’s
important
in
the
discussion
yesterday
of
whether
it
could
be
sent
back
to
the
florida
supreme
court
for
the
purpose
of
expanding
the
class
in
the
statute.
it
isn’t
simply
a
statute.
it’s
a
florida
constitutional
provision
that
we’re
dealing
with.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
very
good.
they’ve
made
a
strong
argument
in
their
briefs
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
basically,
the
state
of
florida
has
two
positions.
first
of
all,
that
the
compelling
interest
tests
of
the
frontiero
plurality
should
not
be
applied
to
sex
classifications
and,
secondly,
that
the
classification
of
widows
to
the
exclusion
of
widowers
in
view
of
the
purpose
and
the
factual
realities
of
this
situation
does
not,
as
applied
to
the
appellant
here,
violate
the
equal
protection
either,--
whether
tested
by
frontiero
in
the
plurality
or
by
the
standard
in
reed,
if
in
fact
that’s
different
from
traditional
standards,
or
by
traditional
tax
classification
in
sex
standards.
and
i’ll
address
myself
first
to
the
traditional
test
because
i
feel
that,
under
that
test,
it’s
clear
that
the
distinction
here
meets
the
test.
first
of
all,
the
classification
we
have
is
a
classification
of
widows
and
widowers,
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
classification?
the
state
of
florida,
as
noted
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
recognizes
by
this
classification
that
women
and
especially
widows
are
an
economically
disadvantaged
class
in
our
society.
this
is
not
in
line
with
past
cases
where
stereotypes
were
developed
for
the
purpose
of
so-called
protective
legislation
for
denying
women
something
on
a
basis
of
a
stereotype
that
wasn’t
backed
up
by
facts
but
was
backed
up
by
beliefs
that
people
had,
by
mythology,
really.
it’s
not
based
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
what?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
widows,
yes,
i
would
say
that
widows
is
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
statistics
of
the
country
--
the
widows
are
to
the
country
--
i
think
the
widows
are
economically
disadvantaged.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right.
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
if
they--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i
think--
but,
basically,
the
fact
is
that
taking
a
widow
and
a
widower,
the
general
facts
are
that
a
widow
has
a
likelihood
if
she
must
transfer
into
the
job
market
of
not
being
able
to
earn
as
much
as
the
widower
simply,
if
for
no
other
reason,
then
the
fact
is
that
women
in
general
can
only
earn
--
are
only
earning
60%
of
what
men
earn.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
they
are
discriminated
against,
and
i
think
it’s
a
recognition
of
that
fact.
the
florida
statute
really
wrecking
and
constitutional
provision
merely
recognizes
the
women
not
because
of
any
inherent
problem
with
women
but
with
an
inherent
problem
with
our
society
that
hasn’t
been
corrected
yet
are,
in
fact,
discriminated
against.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
other
than
this
particular
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
provision?
i’m
not
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
women
other
than
widowers?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
provisions
that
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
it
was
the
wills
of
people
in
adopting
the
constitution
of
florida.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
this
constitution
was
adopted
in
1968,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
was
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
1885,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
in
a
better
position
now
than
they
were
in
1885?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
but,
clearly,
they
are
not
by
any
means
have
been
given
economic
equality
in
society,
and
i
think
this
is
a
recognition
of
that.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
i
think
the
law
has
always
recognized
that
no
class
is
going
to
be
perfect
even
if
we
took
$4,000
limen
than
anyone
who
earns
$4,000
or
less
should
get
$500
exemption
but
still
have
the
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
we
still
have
the
problem
of
saying
that
there
are
people
who
earn
$4,000
who
have
no
dependents
and
there
are
people
who
earn
$4,001
who
have
10
dependents
and
are
much
more
needy.
obviously,
for
the
purpose
of
taxation,
states
have
never
been
called
on
to
treat
every
case
on
an
individual
basis.
and,
i
think
that
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
court
will
recognize
that
that’s
not
a
practical
possibility.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i
would
say
it's
sex
as
tied
to
economic
reality.
in
other
words,
the
class
is
not
simply
actually
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
fact,
the
class
isn’t--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
other
than
sex?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
one,
the
fact
that
a
widower
being
a
man
is
recognized
as
having
greater
earning
potential
in
our
society
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
pardon?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
no,
there
is
no
way
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it’s
based
--
let’s
say
that
it’s
based
on
sex
is
accurate,
but
it’s
based
on
sex
plus
an
underlying
recognition
of
factual
difference
between
the
sexes
are
not
simply
a
stereotype
difference
between
men
and
women.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
the
law
of
florida
prevented
women
from
serving
on
juries.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
but
it
didn’t
prevent
them
from
showing
on
juries.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
women
were
not
prevented
from
serving
on
juries.
they
had
to
take
affirmative
action
to
indicate
a
desire
to
serve
on
juries.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
at
the
time
of
the
hoyt
case,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
at
the
time
the
original
constitution
of
florida.
i’m
not
prepared
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
i’m
suggesting
that
this
case
is
very
little
and
different
than
gruenwald
versus
gardner
which
was
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
because
i
think
it
recognizes
the
underlying
rationale.
the
class
is
not
simply
widows.
the
class
is
widows,
the
blind,
and
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
i
think
that
all
those
have
the
same
line
of
reasoning
running
through
them
for
different
reasons.
but
disabled
or
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
all
are
economically
disabled.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
works
to
benefit
the
wealthy
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
blind
person
also.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
right,
but
the
fact
is
that,
as
a
general
objective
analysis,
women
and
widows
are
not
in
the
same
economic
classification
as
our
widowers.
they
don’t
have
the
same
opportunities.
first
of
all,
a
woman
who
is
a
widow
is
either
one
of
two
possibilities.
one,
she’s
the
head
of
the
household,
the
same
as
the
widower
and,
in
that
case,
the
distinction
is
exactly
as
i’ve
said
that
she
has
to
--
she
does
not
have,
as
a
general
rule,
the
job
opportunity
that
the
male
does.
the
other
case
is
where
she
has
been
--
she
has
not
been
the
head
of
the
household
and
a
widow
--
then
the
husband
is
the
one
that
dies.
and,
in
that
case,
she
not
only
has
to
move
over
into
the
job
market
but
she
has
to
get
someone
to
replace
her
and
take
over
the
duties
that
she
had,
which
is
really
a
double
burden
compared
to
the
man
whose
wife
dies
who
simply
has
to
replace
the
functions
that
his
wife
had
in
the
family
unit.
she
has
to
do
both
that
and
move
over
into
the
job
market.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
she
hasn’t
--
well,
i
would
agree
that
they
aren’t
--
that
that’s
true
but
they’re
even
compounded
by
discrimination
and
that
the
job
opportunities
not
only
to
an
elderly
person
but
to
her
particularly
are
greatly
lessened
both
by
her
age
and
by
her
sex.
now,
as
to
the
general
classification,
the
traditional
test,
first
of
all,
if
the
court
is
to
use
that
test,
then
we
would
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
all
the
tax
cases
where
there
are
tax
classifications,
there’s
a
presumption
of
constitutionality,
a
heavy
burden
on
one
challenging
the
classification
to
show
no
conceivable
permissible
basis
and
it’s
been
recognized
that
the
classification
need
not
be
exact
or
have
mathematical
nicety.
clearly,
if
the
no
conceivable
rationale
purpose
test
is
to
be
used,
i’d
submit
that
the
appellant
here
has
not
met
that
burden.
not
only
is
there
a
conceivable
rational
purpose,
i
submit,
but
the
purpose
that
we’ve
offered
to
the
court
is
in
accordance
with
proper
tax
purpose
concerned
for
the
economically
disadvantaged
groups
in
society,
and
that
that’s
a
valid
social
concern.
secondly,
under
reed
versus
reed,
it’s
possible
that
that
case
could
be
read
to
say
that
there
is
an
additional
burden
that
the
court
is
going
to
place
on
the
state
where
it
makes
a
classification,
and
that’s
the
burden
of
justifying
a
rational
classification.
and,
i
submit
again
that
we
have
not
relied
on
stereotypes
that
women
are
either
physically
not
capable
of
doing
the
work
that
men
are
capable
of
doing
or
the
women
are
in
some
way,
because
they’re
the
creator
of
children,
that
they
should
stay
at
home.
we’re
not
saying
that.
we
believe
that
women
have
all
the
rights
that
men
have,
but
that
the
facts
of
our
society
are
that
women
have
not
yet
been
given
those
economic
rights
and
that,
until
they
do,
it’s
appropriate
for
the
state
of
florida
to
have
legislation
which
recognizes
that
and
gives
them
an
affirmative
chance
to
pull
themselves
to
attain
equality.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
it’s
a
small
amount
is
true.
but,
to
argue
that
the
state
of
florida
should
give
more,
the
determination
of
the
people
of
florida
was
that
it
was
an
appropriate
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
gesture,
and
it
is
the
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
fact
is
that
someone
at
a
low
level
of
income,
$15
-
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
annually,
may
enable
them
to
retain
property
which
they
would
otherwise
not
be
able
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
--
to
retain.
while
we
submit
that
the
plurality
opinion
in
frontiero,
frontiero
should
not
be
applied.
i
would
submit
that
based
on
that
decision,
the
classification
that
we’ve
established
is
sufficient.
that
case
specifically,
in
a
footnote,
refers
to
in
footnote
22
i
believe
it
is,
states
it
should
be
noted
that
these
statutes
and
those
are
the
statutes
in
frontiero
are
not
in
any
sense
designed
to
rectify
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
against
women
citing
gruenwald
versus
gardner
and
jones
versus
mayer
and
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach.
and,
on
the
contrary,
these
statutes
seize
upon
a
group
of
women
who
have
historically
suffered
discrimination
in
employment
and
rely
on
the
effects
of
this
past
discrimination
as
a
justification
for
heaping
on
additional
economic
disadvantages.
that
isn’t
the
case
that
we
have
here.
there’s
no
--
there
is
--
i
mean,
the
second
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
here.
there
is
no
purpose,
nor
result
of
heaping
additional
economic
disadvantages
on
women.
there
is
a
purpose
of
taking
affirmative
action
if
indeed
women
are
to
be
determined
to
be
a
suspect
classification
to
reduce
the
results
of
past
historic
discrimination,
so
that
even
under
frontiero
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
approve
this
classification.
however,
i
think
it’s
well
to
point
out
to
the
court,
and
we
submit,
that
this
court
has,
in
general,
limited
suspect
classifications
to
groups
which
sense
that
have
been
described
since
carrying
products
as
discrete
and
insular
minorities.
and,
i
would
submit
that
a
classification
based
on
sex
does
not
have
within
it
a
discrete
and
insular
minority
whether
be
it
the
plaintiff
here
who
is
a
male
seeking
to
have
the
statute
applied
to
him
or
else
struck
down
all
together.
clearly,
the
male
is
not
a
minority
in
a
group
where
men
and
women
are
equal
and
if
women
are
anything,
it
would
be,
i
guess,
a
philosophical
minority
and
that
they’ve
been
discriminated
against.
but,
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
court
has
found
that
a
philosophical
minority
qualifies
for
a
strict
scrutiny
and
i
think
it’s
proper
because
any
group
that
is
an
interest
group
is
a
minority
and
it
may
not
get
everything
at
once
out
of
the
judicial
process
and
it’s
not
for
the
court,
every
time
some
group
other
than
a
racial
classification
or
an
easily
identifiable
classification
like
that
comes
before
the
court
to
give
strict
scrutiny
to
something
that
doesn’t
--
to
a
statute
that
doesn’t
give
that
interest
group
what
it
wants.
and,
on
those
grounds,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
this
classification
should
be
upheld.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
this
is
--
no,
it’s
a
tax
on
both
real
and
personal
property.
it’s
on
any
ad
valorem
taxation
which,
in
ad
valorem
taxes
in
florida
are
both
on
real
and
personal
property.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it’s
assessed
at
100
--
by
constitution,
it’s
to
be
assessed
at
full
market
value,
100%.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
that’s
in
the
court’s
now
as
to
whether
in
fact
it
is
assessed
at
100%
of
market
value.
in
fact,
it’s
--
i
would
say,
assessed
between
80%
and
100%
of
market
value.
that’s
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
varies
by
counties.
that’s
right.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
assessors
of
the
counties
do
the
assessing.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
however,
to
add
to
that,
all
assessments
are
reviewed
for
the
purpose
of
equalization
by
the
department
of
revenue
of
the
state
of
florida.
so
that,
theoretically,
when
they
approve
it,
it’s
a
determination
that
that
county
is
at
100%
of
assessed
value.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
the
question
is
really
limited.
it
might
be
enough
for
one
widow.
it
might
not
be
enough
for
another.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
is
directly
at
100%
of
assessed
value,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
rate
would
generally
be
30
mills
which
would
translate
into
--
the
30
mills
would
translate
into
a
$15
exemption
under
this.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
$600.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
$600.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
7%
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right
and
i
think
that’s
just
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i
would
imagine
they
would
--
i
really
can’t
answer
that,
your
honor.
those
figures
were
drawn
out
because
we
were
especially
concerned
with
the
florida
situation.
i
imagine
that
they
would
probably
be
typical.
i
know
of
no
situation
in
florida
that
would
make
them
a
typical
on
a
national
basis,
but
i
can’t
represent
that
to
the
court.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
pardon?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
ones
below
the
poverty
level,
your
honor?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
not
necessarily
in
florida,
your
honor,
because
you
have
a
lot
of
very
poor
people
that
own
property
and
that
they
own
mobile
homes.
that’s
the
typical
situation
in
florida.
much
more
so
than
any
other
state.
i’d
say
a
much
larger
percentage
of
those
than
in
a
typical
state
would
be
in
a
position
where
they
were
in
property
ownership.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i’m
sorry?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
i
live
in
the
turpentine
area,
your
honor,
and
it’s
not
so
much
as
the
rest
of
the
state
but,
certainly,
it’s
a
mobile
home
area
the
same
as
the
other
part
of
the
state,
although
it’s
not
so
much
of
the
elderly
living
there.
so,
that’s
part
of
the
problem.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
we
submit
that
this
statute
is
a
wreck.
this
statute
and
constitutional
provision
are
a
recognition
of
the
economic
realities
of
the
state
of
florida.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
pretty
good,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
that
part
of
the
argument
yesterday,
i
feel
that
it’s
necessary
this
time
to
clarify
some
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
is
a
claim
by
a
widower
that
he
has
been
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law
both
by
a
mandatory,
self-executing
provision
of
a
florida
constitution
and
by
a
statute
providing
exemption
from
ad
valorem
taxation
of
properties
with
a
value
of
$500
yearly
for
widows
but
not
for
widowers.
now,
that’s
important
for
two
reasons.
one,
first
of
all,
counsel
in
argument
yesterday
stated
that
this
was
a
deduction
from
taxation.
in
fact,
it’s
not
a
deduction.
it’s
an
exemption
to
the
amount
of
$500
which,
in
dollar
terms
translated
through
the
assessment
laws
of
florida,
comes
out
to
about
a
$15
amount.
secondly,
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
we
don’t
make
a
de
minimis
argument.
i
simply
wanted
to
clarify
the
fact
that
it’s
not
a
$500
deduction
from
tax
but
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
there
is
a
difference.
the
exemption--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
exemption
is
from
the
ad
valorem
value
of
the
property.
in
other
words,
if
property
is
worth
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
makes
a
difference
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
no
legal
difference
as
far
as
this
particular
case.
i
merely
wanted
to
clarify
the
fact,
your
honor.
secondly
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it’s
a
$15-benefit
and
i
was
merely
trying
to
put
it
in
perspective.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
and
we’re
not
making
an
argument
that
the
case
should
not
be
here.
the
other
question
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
other
question
though
is
of
more
significance
and
that’s
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with,
as
i
say,
not
simply
a
statute
but
a
provision
of
the
florida
constitution.
and
this
is
significant
in
that,
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
we
know
of
no
case
providing
for
this
court
or
the
florida
court
to
expand
a
provision
of
the
constitution
to
include
members
of
a
class
who
are
not
included
in
the
class
where
there
is
no
ambiguity,
and
i
think
that’s
important
in
the
discussion
yesterday
of
whether
it
could
be
sent
back
to
the
florida
supreme
court
for
the
purpose
of
expanding
the
class
in
the
statute.
it
isn’t
simply
a
statute.
it’s
a
florida
constitutional
provision
that
we’re
dealing
with.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
very
good.
they’ve
made
a
strong
argument
in
their
briefs
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
basically,
the
state
of
florida
has
two
positions.
first
of
all,
that
the
compelling
interest
tests
of
the
frontiero
plurality
should
not
be
applied
to
sex
classifications
and,
secondly,
that
the
classification
of
widows
to
the
exclusion
of
widowers
in
view
of
the
purpose
and
the
factual
realities
of
this
situation
does
not,
as
applied
to
the
appellant
here,
violate
the
equal
protection
either,--
whether
tested
by
frontiero
in
the
plurality
or
by
the
standard
in
reed,
if
in
fact
that’s
different
from
traditional
standards,
or
by
traditional
tax
classification
in
sex
standards.
and
i’ll
address
myself
first
to
the
traditional
test
because
i
feel
that,
under
that
test,
it’s
clear
that
the
distinction
here
meets
the
test.
first
of
all,
the
classification
we
have
is
a
classification
of
widows
and
widowers,
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
classification?
the
state
of
florida,
as
noted
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
recognizes
by
this
classification
that
women
and
especially
widows
are
an
economically
disadvantaged
class
in
our
society.
this
is
not
in
line
with
past
cases
where
stereotypes
were
developed
for
the
purpose
of
so-called
protective
legislation
for
denying
women
something
on
a
basis
of
a
stereotype
that
wasn’t
backed
up
by
facts
but
was
backed
up
by
beliefs
that
people
had,
by
mythology,
really.
it’s
not
based
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
what?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
widows,
yes,
i
would
say
that
widows
is
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
statistics
of
the
country
--
the
widows
are
to
the
country
--
i
think
the
widows
are
economically
disadvantaged.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right.
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
if
they--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i
think--
but,
basically,
the
fact
is
that
taking
a
widow
and
a
widower,
the
general
facts
are
that
a
widow
has
a
likelihood
if
she
must
transfer
into
the
job
market
of
not
being
able
to
earn
as
much
as
the
widower
simply,
if
for
no
other
reason,
then
the
fact
is
that
women
in
general
can
only
earn
--
are
only
earning
60%
of
what
men
earn.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
they
are
discriminated
against,
and
i
think
it’s
a
recognition
of
that
fact.
the
florida
statute
really
wrecking
and
constitutional
provision
merely
recognizes
the
women
not
because
of
any
inherent
problem
with
women
but
with
an
inherent
problem
with
our
society
that
hasn’t
been
corrected
yet
are,
in
fact,
discriminated
against.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
other
than
this
particular
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
provision?
i’m
not
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
women
other
than
widowers?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
provisions
that
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
it
was
the
wills
of
people
in
adopting
the
constitution
of
florida.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
this
constitution
was
adopted
in
1968,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
was
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
1885,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
in
a
better
position
now
than
they
were
in
1885?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
but,
clearly,
they
are
not
by
any
means
have
been
given
economic
equality
in
society,
and
i
think
this
is
a
recognition
of
that.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
i
think
the
law
has
always
recognized
that
no
class
is
going
to
be
perfect
even
if
we
took
$4,000
limen
than
anyone
who
earns
$4,000
or
less
should
get
$500
exemption
but
still
have
the
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
we
still
have
the
problem
of
saying
that
there
are
people
who
earn
$4,000
who
have
no
dependents
and
there
are
people
who
earn
$4,001
who
have
10
dependents
and
are
much
more
needy.
obviously,
for
the
purpose
of
taxation,
states
have
never
been
called
on
to
treat
every
case
on
an
individual
basis.
and,
i
think
that
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
court
will
recognize
that
that’s
not
a
practical
possibility.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i
would
say
it's
sex
as
tied
to
economic
reality.
in
other
words,
the
class
is
not
simply
actually
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
fact,
the
class
isn’t--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
other
than
sex?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
one,
the
fact
that
a
widower
being
a
man
is
recognized
as
having
greater
earning
potential
in
our
society
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
pardon?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
no,
there
is
no
way
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it’s
based
--
let’s
say
that
it’s
based
on
sex
is
accurate,
but
it’s
based
on
sex
plus
an
underlying
recognition
of
factual
difference
between
the
sexes
are
not
simply
a
stereotype
difference
between
men
and
women.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
the
law
of
florida
prevented
women
from
serving
on
juries.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
but
it
didn’t
prevent
them
from
showing
on
juries.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
women
were
not
prevented
from
serving
on
juries.
they
had
to
take
affirmative
action
to
indicate
a
desire
to
serve
on
juries.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
at
the
time
of
the
hoyt
case,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
at
the
time
the
original
constitution
of
florida.
i’m
not
prepared
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
i’m
suggesting
that
this
case
is
very
little
and
different
than
gruenwald
versus
gardner
which
was
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
because
i
think
it
recognizes
the
underlying
rationale.
the
class
is
not
simply
widows.
the
class
is
widows,
the
blind,
and
the
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
i
think
that
all
those
have
the
same
line
of
reasoning
running
through
them
for
different
reasons.
but
disabled
or
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
all
are
economically
disabled.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
works
to
benefit
the
wealthy
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
blind
person
also.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
right,
but
the
fact
is
that,
as
a
general
objective
analysis,
women
and
widows
are
not
in
the
same
economic
classification
as
our
widowers.
they
don’t
have
the
same
opportunities.
first
of
all,
a
woman
who
is
a
widow
is
either
one
of
two
possibilities.
one,
she’s
the
head
of
the
household,
the
same
as
the
widower
and,
in
that
case,
the
distinction
is
exactly
as
i’ve
said
that
she
has
to
--
she
does
not
have,
as
a
general
rule,
the
job
opportunity
that
the
male
does.
the
other
case
is
where
she
has
been
--
she
has
not
been
the
head
of
the
household
and
a
widow
--
then
the
husband
is
the
one
that
dies.
and,
in
that
case,
she
not
only
has
to
move
over
into
the
job
market
but
she
has
to
get
someone
to
replace
her
and
take
over
the
duties
that
she
had,
which
is
really
a
double
burden
compared
to
the
man
whose
wife
dies
who
simply
has
to
replace
the
functions
that
his
wife
had
in
the
family
unit.
she
has
to
do
both
that
and
move
over
into
the
job
market.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
she
hasn’t
--
well,
i
would
agree
that
they
aren’t
--
that
that’s
true
but
they’re
even
compounded
by
discrimination
and
that
the
job
opportunities
not
only
to
an
elderly
person
but
to
her
particularly
are
greatly
lessened
both
by
her
age
and
by
her
sex.
now,
as
to
the
general
classification,
the
traditional
test,
first
of
all,
if
the
court
is
to
use
that
test,
then
we
would
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
all
the
tax
cases
where
there
are
tax
classifications,
there’s
a
presumption
of
constitutionality,
a
heavy
burden
on
one
challenging
the
classification
to
show
no
conceivable
permissible
basis
and
it’s
been
recognized
that
the
classification
need
not
be
exact
or
have
mathematical
nicety.
clearly,
if
the
no
conceivable
rationale
purpose
test
is
to
be
used,
i’d
submit
that
the
appellant
here
has
not
met
that
burden.
not
only
is
there
a
conceivable
rational
purpose,
i
submit,
but
the
purpose
that
we’ve
offered
to
the
court
is
in
accordance
with
proper
tax
purpose
concerned
for
the
economically
disadvantaged
groups
in
society,
and
that
that’s
a
valid
social
concern.
secondly,
under
reed
versus
reed,
it’s
possible
that
that
case
could
be
read
to
say
that
there
is
an
additional
burden
that
the
court
is
going
to
place
on
the
state
where
it
makes
a
classification,
and
that’s
the
burden
of
justifying
a
rational
classification.
and,
i
submit
again
that
we
have
not
relied
on
stereotypes
that
women
are
either
physically
not
capable
of
doing
the
work
that
men
are
capable
of
doing
or
the
women
are
in
some
way,
because
they’re
the
creator
of
children,
that
they
should
stay
at
home.
we’re
not
saying
that.
we
believe
that
women
have
all
the
rights
that
men
have,
but
that
the
facts
of
our
society
are
that
women
have
not
yet
been
given
those
economic
rights
and
that,
until
they
do,
it’s
appropriate
for
the
state
of
florida
to
have
legislation
which
recognizes
that
and
gives
them
an
affirmative
chance
to
pull
themselves
to
attain
equality.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
it’s
a
small
amount
is
true.
but,
to
argue
that
the
state
of
florida
should
give
more,
the
determination
of
the
people
of
florida
was
that
it
was
an
appropriate
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
gesture,
and
it
is
the
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
fact
is
that
someone
at
a
low
level
of
income,
$15
-
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
annually,
may
enable
them
to
retain
property
which
they
would
otherwise
not
be
able
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
--
to
retain.
while
we
submit
that
the
plurality
opinion
in
frontiero,
frontiero
should
not
be
applied.
i
would
submit
that
based
on
that
decision,
the
classification
that
we’ve
established
is
sufficient.
that
case
specifically,
in
a
footnote,
refers
to
in
footnote
22
i
believe
it
is,
states
it
should
be
noted
that
these
statutes
and
those
are
the
statutes
in
frontiero
are
not
in
any
sense
designed
to
rectify
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
against
women
citing
gruenwald
versus
gardner
and
jones
versus
mayer
and
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach.
and,
on
the
contrary,
these
statutes
seize
upon
a
group
of
women
who
have
historically
suffered
discrimination
in
employment
and
rely
on
the
effects
of
this
past
discrimination
as
a
justification
for
heaping
on
additional
economic
disadvantages.
that
isn’t
the
case
that
we
have
here.
there’s
no
--
there
is
--
i
mean,
the
second
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
here.
there
is
no
purpose,
nor
result
of
heaping
additional
economic
disadvantages
on
women.
there
is
a
purpose
of
taking
affirmative
action
if
indeed
women
are
to
be
determined
to
be
a
suspect
classification
to
reduce
the
results
of
past
historic
discrimination,
so
that
even
under
frontiero
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
approve
this
classification.
however,
i
think
it’s
well
to
point
out
to
the
court,
and
we
submit,
that
this
court
has,
in
general,
limited
suspect
classifications
to
groups
which
sense
that
have
been
described
since
carrying
products
as
discrete
and
insular
minorities.
and,
i
would
submit
that
a
classification
based
on
sex
does
not
have
within
it
a
discrete
and
insular
minority
whether
be
it
the
plaintiff
here
who
is
a
male
seeking
to
have
the
statute
applied
to
him
or
else
struck
down
all
together.
clearly,
the
male
is
not
a
minority
in
a
group
where
men
and
women
are
equal
and
if
women
are
anything,
it
would
be,
i
guess,
a
philosophical
minority
and
that
they’ve
been
discriminated
against.
but,
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
court
has
found
that
a
philosophical
minority
qualifies
for
a
strict
scrutiny
and
i
think
it’s
proper
because
any
group
that
is
an
interest
group
is
a
minority
and
it
may
not
get
everything
at
once
out
of
the
judicial
process
and
it’s
not
for
the
court,
every
time
some
group
other
than
a
racial
classification
or
an
easily
identifiable
classification
like
that
comes
before
the
court
to
give
strict
scrutiny
to
something
that
doesn’t
--
to
a
statute
that
doesn’t
give
that
interest
group
what
it
wants.
and,
on
those
grounds,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
this
classification
should
be
upheld.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
this
is
--
no,
it’s
a
tax
on
both
real
and
personal
property.
it’s
on
any
ad
valorem
taxation
which,
in
ad
valorem
taxes
in
florida
are
both
on
real
and
personal
property.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it’s
assessed
at
100
--
by
constitution,
it’s
to
be
assessed
at
full
market
value,
100%.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
that’s
in
the
court’s
now
as
to
whether
in
fact
it
is
assessed
at
100%
of
market
value.
in
fact,
it’s
--
i
would
say,
assessed
between
80%
and
100%
of
market
value.
that’s
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
varies
by
counties.
that’s
right.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
assessors
of
the
counties
do
the
assessing.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
however,
to
add
to
that,
all
assessments
are
reviewed
for
the
purpose
of
equalization
by
the
department
of
revenue
of
the
state
of
florida.
so
that,
theoretically,
when
they
approve
it,
it’s
a
determination
that
that
county
is
at
100%
of
assessed
value.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
the
question
is
really
limited.
it
might
be
enough
for
one
widow.
it
might
not
be
enough
for
another.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
it
is
directly
at
100%
of
assessed
value,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
rate
would
generally
be
30
mills
which
would
translate
into
--
the
30
mills
would
translate
into
a
$15
exemption
under
this.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
$600.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
$600.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
7%
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
that’s
right
and
i
think
that’s
just
--
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i
would
imagine
they
would
--
i
really
can’t
answer
that,
your
honor.
those
figures
were
drawn
out
because
we
were
especially
concerned
with
the
florida
situation.
i
imagine
that
they
would
probably
be
typical.
i
know
of
no
situation
in
florida
that
would
make
them
a
typical
on
a
national
basis,
but
i
can’t
represent
that
to
the
court.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
pardon?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
the
ones
below
the
poverty
level,
your
honor?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
not
necessarily
in
florida,
your
honor,
because
you
have
a
lot
of
very
poor
people
that
own
property
and
that
they
own
mobile
homes.
that’s
the
typical
situation
in
florida.
much
more
so
than
any
other
state.
i’d
say
a
much
larger
percentage
of
those
than
in
a
typical
state
would
be
in
a
position
where
they
were
in
property
ownership.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
i’m
sorry?
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
well,
i
live
in
the
turpentine
area,
your
honor,
and
it’s
not
so
much
as
the
rest
of
the
state
but,
certainly,
it’s
a
mobile
home
area
the
same
as
the
other
part
of
the
state,
although
it’s
not
so
much
of
the
elderly
living
there.
so,
that’s
part
of
the
problem.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
h.
mckenzie,
iii
we
submit
that
this
statute
is
a
wreck.
this
statute
and
constitutional
provision
are
a
recognition
of
the
economic
realities
of
the
state
of
florida.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
