justice
thurgood
marshall
first,
i
have
the
opinion
and
judgment
in
number
73-29,
corning
glass
works
versus
brennan,
and
73-695,
brennan
against
the
corning
glass
works.
these
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
both
cases
arise
under
the
equal
pay
act
of
1963,
which
requires
employers
to
pay
men
and
women
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
the
courts
below
were
in
conflict
on
the
principle
question
presented
which
seems
to
be
whether
corning
glass
works
violated
the
act
by
paying
a
higher
base
wage
to
male
night
shift
inspectors
than
it
pay
to
female
inspectors
performing
the
same
tasks
on
the
day
shift,
where
the
higher
wage
is
paid
in
addition
to
separate
night
shift
differentials
paid
to
all
employees
for
night
work.
but
the
reason
set
forth
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
with
the
second
circuit;
the
night
inspection
work
is
performed
under
similar
working
conditions
to
day
inspection
work,
as
the
words
“working
conditions”
are
used
in
the
act.
we,
therefore,
conclude
that
corning
violated
the
act
by
paying
women
less
than
men
for
equal
work.
we
also
hold
that
corning
could
not
remediate
this
violation
except
by
raising
the
wages
of
female
day
shift
inspectors.
therefore,
the
judgment
in
number
73-29
is
affirmed;
the
judgment
in
73-695
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
filed
dissenting
statement.
mr.
justice

no
