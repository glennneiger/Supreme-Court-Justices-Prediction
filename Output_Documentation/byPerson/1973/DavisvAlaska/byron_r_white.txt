justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
--
did
you
say,
you
wanted
to
use
the
record
to
impeach
his
credibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
alaska
supreme
court
mean
when
it
said
that
davis'
claim
is
not
to
be
interested
in
impeaching
the
juvenile,
but
rather
desire
to
show
bias,
prejudice
or
motive
and
that
the
witness
was
under
pressure
to
shift
suspicion
from
himself
to
another,
is
that
a
current
reflection
of
what
you
wanted
to
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
was
interested
in
introducing
the
record
to
show
that
he
had
a
criminal
record
and
he
might
not
be
reliable
or
truthful?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
kind
of
impeachment
goes
to
sort
of
a
general
attack
on
credibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
just
for
the
limited
purpose
of
showing
bias,
prejudice
or
motive
in
the
sense
that
he
had
some
special
reason
for
cooperating
with
the
police?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he
was
on
probation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
any
of
you
had
a
more
limited
reason
for
wanting
to
enter
--
to
use
the
record
then
you
might
have
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
appellant
--
he
claims
not
to
be
interested
in
impeaching
the
juvenile.
now,
we
put
that
aside
whatever
it
is,
you
are
left
with
something
that
is
less
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reason
i
was
interested
in
this
is
the
alaska,
the
state
supreme
court
seem
to
say
that
with
respect
to
this
limited
reason
for
wanting
to
use
the
juvenile
record
that
that
reason
was
amply
satisfied
by
this
scope
of
cross-examination
which
was
allowed.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
would
be
that
you
could
use
a
prior
criminal
record
for
impeachment
for
a
purpose
that
is
wholly
aside
showing
bias.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
and
he
may
not
be
truthful?
