and
it
might
be
that
a
jurisdiction
such
as
alaska
might
wholly
abolish
the
rule
that
permits
impeachment
simply
by
showing
a
prior
conviction
and
i
take
it
your
argument
doesn't
go
to
any
such
general
abolishment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
might
have
had
the
situation
for
showing
that
if
he
were
simply
charged
as
a
juvenile
and
not
even
finally
adjudicated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nothing
in
the
trial
court's
ruling
prevented
you
from
going
into
the
fact
that
the
safe
was
found
on
his
property
and
that
he
had
some
relationship
with
the
owner
of
the
truck,
and
you
were
perfectly
free
to
follow
up
that
as
you
chose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
couldn't
you
under
alaska
practice
had
moved
to
have
his
no
answer
to
your
question
whether
he
had
ever
been
questioned
by
a
police
officer
stricken
since
the
trial
judge
sustained
an
objection
to
the
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
then
treat
the
right
to
confront
not
mainly
the
right
to
cross-examine
generally,
but
the
right
to
cross-examine
about
any
subject
that
the
defense
counsel
chooses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
state
recognizes
a
husband-wife
marital
communication
privilege
and
that
privilege
is
claimed
by
a
witness
on
the
stand
as
being
cross-examined
by
defense
counsel,
do
you
think
that
the
state
court
has
to
abolish
that
in
the
interest
of
confrontation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
have
any
of
our
cases
ever
gone
there
far?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
are
arguing
for
the
state,
aren't
you?
justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
merriner,
does
alaska
practice
provide
an
opportunity
to
counsel
who
finds
himself
in
the
position
of
mr.
wagstaff
did
following
the
combined
answer
of
mr.
green
and
the
objection
by
the
prosecutor
and
the
sustaining
of
the
objection
to
the
question
to
at
least
allow
the
party
that
asked
the
question
and
got
what
is
basically
an
answer
to
a
question
that
has
been
ruled
to
be
impermissible
and
get
that
answer
stricken,
so
that
he
isn’t
both
bound
by
the
answer
and
still
precluded
by
the
court's
ruling
from
following
it
up?
