mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case
is
the
virtual
confrontation
of
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
against
a
state
statute
and
court
rule
which
provides
that
juvenile
record
shall
remain
secret
and
anonymous
in
virtually
all
cases,
save
when
the
juvenile
is
being
sentenced
as
an
adult
and
the
court
in
its
discretion
feels
that
the
juvenile
record
would
be
relevant
or
desirable.
in
this
particular
case,
the
statute
and
court
rule
was
applied
when
a
juvenile
was
testifying
for
the
prosecution
as
a
chief
identification
witness
against
the
accused,
petitioner
davis.
now
we
sought
at
trial
to
use
this
--
his
juvenile
record,
not
simply
to
impeach
his
character
with
prior
wrongful
acts,
but
rather
to
show
that
he
had
biased,
prejudiced
and
was
testifying
out
of
fear
and
favor
when
he
identified
petitioner
joshua
davis
at
trial.
the
court's
protective
order
or
the
court
entered
a
protective
order,
the
trial
court
did,
during
the
voir
dire
examination
for
the
jurors
and
at
that
time,
the
issues
were
fully
raised
or
actually
presented
in
our
briefs
today.
the
confrontation
issue
was
argued
to
the
trial
court.
there
has
here
been
a
significant
diminution
of
cross-examination
and
this
calls
into
question
integrity
of
the
whole
fact-finding
process
and
requires
that
the
competing
interest
be
closely
examined.
the
facts
of
the
davis
case
really
bespeak
the
legal
issues
raised.
a
safe
was
found
on
some
property
next
to
a
truck,
approximately
25
miles
from
north
of
anchorage,
alaska.
the
stepson
of
the
owner
of
this
property,
owned
this
particular
truck
and
was
on
a
probation
for
burglary
as
a
juvenile.
he
had
committed
acts
which
should
he
have
been
an
adult
would
be
burglary.
he
had
been
adjudicated
a
juvenile
delinquent
and
was
under
probation
at
that
time
to
the
juvenile
court,
he
was
sixteen
years
of
age
and
lived
on
this
particular
property.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
to
our
knowledge,
we
never
actually
were
provided
with
the
record
at
that
time,
but
the
respondent
has
admitted
in
essence
what
i
have
just
related
to
the
court
in
their
particular
brief,
we
don't
believe
that's
at
issue.
we
desired
to
bring
this
fact
out
to
the
jury
in
order
to
show
that
this
witness
was
initially
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
be
linked
into
a
burglary
charge
himself
because
this
witness
turned
out
to
be
the
key
critical
identification
witness
and
indeed
the
one
essential
witness
had
trialled
against
joshua
davis.
the
story
that
mr.
green,
the
boy
green
gave
to
the
police
officers
when
they
came
up
to
investigate
the
situation
was
that
earlier
in
the
day
he
had
been
walking
in
the
area
where
the
safe
was
found
and
observed
two
black
men
to
be
standing
near
a
recent,
a
late-model
chevrolet
automobile
metallic
in
color.
he
said
that
he
talked
to
them
briefly
and
asked
what
they
were
doing
there
and
he
asked
they
had
any
trouble
and
they
related
that
they
just
said
something
to
him,
“is
your
father
here?”
he
progressed.
he
said
no.
he
progressed
and
came
back
later
and
stated
that
he
observed
these
two
men
on
same
position,
one
with
a
crowbar.
he
stated
that
he
probably
could
identify
them.
the
next
day
green
was
taken
down
to
the
police
station
in
anchorage
and
apparently
coercive
environment
to
begin
with,
coupled
with
this,
he
was
taken
into
a
small
room
in
the
presence
of
four
detectives,
seated
between
the
two
chief
--
the
two
actual
investigating
officers,
one
of
them
was
packaging
pistols
apparently
in
connection
with
another
case
and
given
either
five
or
six
photographs
and
asked
to
see
if
he
could
identify
one
or
both
of
the
persons
that
he
claimed
to
have
seen
standing
where
this
safe
was
found.
now
at
this
particular
point
in
time,
our
theory
of
the
case
and
the
one
that
we
were
precluded
from
presenting
to
the
jury
was
that
green
was
under
a
lot
of
pressure
then
to
identify
someone
else.
he
in
his
own
mind
if
not
actually
was
a
suspect
of
this
burglary
and
was
under
strong
impetus
to
in
fact
pick
someone
out
of
these
photographs
in
order
to
take
the
heat
off
of
himself.
again,
the
jury
was
not
aware
of
these
circumstances.
he
did
in
fact
take
a
picture
out,
one
of
which
was
the
picture
of
joshua
davis.
there
was
a
subsequent
line
up
and
then
an
identification
at
trial.
our
point
is
that
when
this
initial
photographic
identification
was
made,
green
was
then
and
from
that
point
forward
locked
into
this
identification
and
this
was
the
critical
point
in
time
when
the
identification
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
in
the
trial?
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
i
did
not.
an
objection
was
made
at
that
time
when
i
asked
that
question.
there
was
a
negative
response.
that
objection
was
incomplete,
attempting
to
raise
in
the
jury's
mind
and
the
court
said
simply
i'll
sustain
the
objection
and
at
that
point
i
believe
that
the
court
and
the
record
reflects
was
referring
to
its
prior
protective
order
that
we
couldn't
get
into
that
particular
area.
respondent
attempts
to
limit
the
meaning
of
that
question
with
the
words
like
that.
i
think
when
the
question
is
read
in
conjunction
with
the
prior
questions
which
was
and
then
you
went
into
the
investigating
room
with
investigator
gray
and
investigator
weaver,
yeah,
and
they
started
asking
you
questions
about
the
incident,
is
that
correct?
yeah.
have
you
ever
been
questioned
like
that
before
by
any
law
enforcement
officers?
the
answer
was
no.
again,
we
feel
that
this
answer
itself
was
--
must
have
been
untruthful
and
we
were
precluded
from
showing
this
to
the
jury.
also
we
not
only
were
prohibited
from
cross-examining
green
on
this
point,
but
the
police
investigators
as
well
with
respect
to
particular
pressures
they
may
have
put
on
green
at
the
time
of
the
initial
photographic
identification.
particularly
investigator
gray
was
asked,
did
you
at
any
time
suspect
green
to
be
involved
in
this
burglary?
he
responded
no.
cross-examination
at
that
point
was
precluded
on
how
is
your
negative
response
consistent
with
your
knowledge
that
he
in
fact
was
a
juvenile
on
probation
for
burglary.
the
safe
was
found
on
his
land
next
to
his
truck.
again
that
question
was
precluded.
the
prosecution
at
trial
made
the
most
of
their
protective
order.
the
jury
was
in
essence
given
a
distorted
view
of
exactly
what
green
was
and
who
he
was.
the
protective
order
of
course
came
during
the
voir
dire
examination,
so
any
mention
of
the
problem,
the
juvenile
record
would
not
come
before
the
jury.
in
closing
the
argument,
the
prosecution
stated
that
the
petitioner's
entire
defense,
which
--
our
entire
defense
was
that
the
green's
identification
was
unreliable,
that
he
was
under
pressure.
we
tried
to
show
just
by
the
fact
that
he
was
--
the
safe
was
found
on
his
property
next
to
his
truck
that
he
would
be
under
pressure.
that
was
our
defense,
this
was
developed
an
opening
statement
throughout
the
trial
and
closing
argument.
the
prosecution
in
the
closing
argument
claimed
that
this
was
a
total
red
herring
issue,
one
that
we
had
just
made
up
and
that
there
is
no
basis
for
this
belief.
he
also
said
and
i
am
referring
to
pages
422
and
424
of
the
transcript
that
our
defense
of
bias
and
prejudice
in
fear
and
favor
on
part
of
green
came
as
a
result
of
pure
suspicion
of
society
and
suspicion
of
law
enforcement
officers.
of
course,
the
prosecutor
must
have
known
in
his
own
mind,
at
least,
the
origins
of
our
attack
on
witness
green's
credibility
and
any
bias
or
any
fear
and
favor
he
had
in
testifying,
that
came
from
other
independent
sources
than
that.
as
a
result
of
green's
identification
at
the
station
house,
his
search
warrant
was
obtained
for
the
car
belonging
to
petitioner
joshua
davis.
a
search
was
made
of
records
of
rental
car
agencies,
the
police
suspected
because
of
the
description
of
the
car,
maybe
it
is
a
rental
car.
they
found
the
car
rented
to
petitioner,
obtained
a
search
warrant
for
the
premises,
his
house
and
also
vehicle.
as
a
result
of
this
search,
they
found
evidence
inferentially
relating
petitioner's
car
to
being
present
perhaps
at
the
scene
or
actually
with
having
had
a
safe,
perhaps,
in
the
trunk
of
the
rented
car
at
one
time
as
to
extent
of
the
other
evidence
presented
against
petitioner
at
trial.
the
actual
evidence
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
were
insulation
fibers
that
could
have
come
from
a
safe
and
paint
chips
that
could
have
come
from
the
safe.
this
was
the
extent
of
the
identification
of
these
particular
substances.
there
was
no
--
there
were
no
fibers
or
paint
chips
found
on
petitioner's
clothing
or
on
shoes
or
nor
was
the
money
found
that
was
allegedly
in
the
safe.
none
of
the
things
that
the
search
warrant
basically
was
seeking
were
ever
found,
just
these
small
items
of
evidence.
this
is
important,
of
course,
to
lead
to
the
significance
of
green's
identification,
the
crucial
nature,
the
essential
nature
of
his
testimony.
its
essential
nature,
i
do
not
believe
is
actually
in
dispute.
it
was
admitted
at
trial
during
the
motion
for
a
protective
order
described
as
essential
witness
with
that
very
word.
also,
the
alaska
supreme
court
in
their
opinion
described
him
as
an
essential
witness,
that
the
case
could
not
have
been
made
without
him.
the
trial
judge
ruled
on
the
issue,
on
the
basis
strictly
of
the
state
statute
and
the
rule
involved.
he
initially
was
inclined
to
rule
in
our
favor
as
the
record
reflects
and
stated
when
he
reversed
himself
that
he
really
didn't
agree
with
what
he
was
doing,
but
he
felt
constrained
to
do
so
by
a
specific
court
rule
in
alaska
and
which
is
cited,
of
course,
he
is
doing--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
his
juvenile
record?
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
absolutely
not.
his
record
would
not
be,
he
did
not
testify
for
one
thing,
but
assuming
that
if
he
had
testified
then
the
state
statute
would
have
prohibited
and
the
rule
prohibited
from
being
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
as
it
should
be.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
the
different
is
what?
well,
in
this
case,
that
green
was
not
being
accused
of
anything,
the
record
was
not
sought
to
be
used
against
him
strictly.
it
was
sought
to
be
used
to
impeach
his
credibility,
not
even
necessarily
to
attack
his
character,
but
that
he
was
testifying
under
fear
and
favor
and
if
there
is
any
conflict
between
that
particular
state
law
and
rule
in
the
sixth
amendment,
then
the
statute
and
rule
must
exceed
to
the
sixth
amendment,
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
green's
credibility,
yes,
and
to
show
that
he
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes
it
is.
we
are
talking
about
impeachment
and
credibility.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
we
weren't
using
it
under
the
state
rule
of
evidence
which
provides
that
impeachment
of
character
may
come
about
by
showing
a
specific
bad
action
and
we
weren't
attempting
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
the
distinction
that
i
would
make
is
that
would
be
an
attack
on
the
witness's
character.
in
this
case,
we
wanted
to
make
a
specific
attack
on
his
credibility
to
show
bias
and
prejudice.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes.
that
--
there
would
be
two
parts
to
what
his
special
motive
for
the
identification
would
be.
the
first
part
would
be
to
take
the
pressure
off
himself
when
he
made
that
initial
identification
shortly
after
the
safe
was
discovered
on
his
property
next
to
his
trunk,
that
he
was
very
anxious
to
do
that,
that
the
investigation
be
turned
away
from
him,
at
least,
as
he
thought
in
his
own
mind,
and
secondly,
that
he
would
have
impetus
to
testify
just
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
was
on
probation
and
would
somehow
hope
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
i
don't
think
i
understand
your
question,
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
have
tried
to
cover
that
somewhat
in
my
reply
brief
that
when
the
term
impeachment
and
the
term
attack
on
credibility
have
been
used
somewhat
interchangeably
and
i
tried
to
distinguish
them
at
least
for
purposes
of
my
argument
in
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
in
support
of
our
position
also
make
that
distinction.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
don't
think
that
the
alaska
supreme
court
was
limiting
themselves
to
strictly
impeachment
in
the
terms
of
the
particular
civil
rule.
i
think,
they
were
talking
about
a
general
impeachment
attack
and
i
think
that
to
define
under
two
subheadings,
under
the
word
impeachment,
attack
against
character
and
attack
against
credibility.
the
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
agree
with
that
completely
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
what
report
must
have
made
was
using
--
they're
using
the
term
impeachment
as
a
word
of
art,
particularly,
and
i
cited
it
in
the
first
part
of
my
brief
under
alaska
civil
rule
43.
it
talks
about
impeachment
by
an
adverse
party
and
then
it
goes
on
that
a
party
may
not
be
impeached
by
evidence
of
wrong,
particular
wrongful
acts
except
that
it
maybe
shown
by
the
examination
of
the
witness
or
the
record
of
a
judgment
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
talking
about
then.
we
weren't
attempting
to
do
that,
although,
as
i've
argued
in
my
brief
i
think
that
that
even
should
be
allowed
and
let
the
jury
determine
the
particular
significance.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
wasn't
pushing
for
that
and
we
aren't
pushing
for
that
now
because
it's
not
necessary
in
this
case,
but
i
think
it
should
be.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
that
simply
this
person
is
a
bad
person.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
it
does
not
and
of
course
there
is
a
perceptible
trend
in
that
direction,
but
we
were
not
limiting,
we
were
not
offering
it
solely
for
that
purpose
and
actually
that
was
the
secondary
purpose.
the
primary
purpose
was
to
show
that
this
witness
in
his
own
mind,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
was
on
probation
for
burglary
would
feel
that
he
was
a
suspect.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
it
could
be
--
his
mind
is
what
is
critical
and
the
jury
should
be
allowed
to
determine
what
factors
were
present
in
his
mind,
what
pressures
he
would
feel.
we
relied
very
heavily
on
of
course
two
cases
where
this
is
discussed
greatly
off
a
case
in
smith
versus
illinois
and
i
think
those
cases
are
directly
applicable
here.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
i
think
that's
absolutely
correct
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
what
they
found,
but,
of
course,
the
questions
that
were
permitted
were
only
self-serving
general
questions
such
as
did
you
feel
you
are
under
pressure
mr.
green,
do
you
feel
you
might
be
a
suspect?
questions
like
this
which
he
answered
negatively,
which
he
would
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
but
that's
the
extent
of
it.
we
could
not
bring
it
home
to
the
juries
as
the
chief
justice
rabinowitz
points
out
in
his
dissent,
the
pressures
that
green
must
have
had
felt
in
his
own
mind
and
when
he
denied
that
he
felt
these
pressures
and
when
he
denied
that
he
had
ever
been
questioned
by
a
police
officer
before.
these
were
questions
that
were
ripe
for
exposure
and
cross-examination
that
the
witness
either
had
a
very
bad
memory
or
was
lying
or
whatever
other
reasons
can
be
expressed.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
it
was
not
my
objection.
it
was
--
i
think,
the
demotion
would
have
been
made
--
that
motion
to
strike
would
have
been
made
by
the
person
making
the
objection,
the
prosecutor.
i
think
that
the
normal
trial
practice
is
let
the
answer
stand,
it's
been
made.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
well,
i
didn't
know
was
of
course.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
you
know
i
would
be
bound
by
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
the
order,
protective
order
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes
your
honor,
thank
you.
now
with
respect
to
a
follow-up
on
that
particular
answer,
whether
that
should
have
been
done
at
trial,
i
think
you
should
look
back
to
the
court’s
initial
ruling,
the
--
when
the
protective
order
was
asked
for,
it
was
unequivocal,
it
cited,
the
court
says,
you
didn’t
want
to
go
in
this
area
at
all.
we
were
getting
into
that
area
a
little
bit
and
that’s
why
perhaps
it
was
not
pursued
at
that
time.
i
don’t
think
that
particular
question
is
essential.
it’s
another
--
it's
another
reason
why
cross-examination
should
have
been
allowed
on
that
particular
issue.
of
course,
we
never
know
again
what
the
cross-examination
of
his
record
would
have
revealed
and
that’s
the
whole
reason
of
permitting
cross-examination.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
would
say
what
prevented
me
from
doing
that
was
the
court's
indication
of
the
rule
on
protective
order
that
you
essentially
felt
that
his
juvenile
record
was
invalid,
that’s
how
i
will
answer
that
question,
i
do
answer
it.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that,
perhaps,
could
have
been
done
and
again,
the
reason
why
i
would
not,
is
because
of
the
protective
order
was
interpreted
and
the
force
of
it
and
the
rapid
objection
and
the
sustaining
of
it.
again,
the
critical
issue
are
not
these
particular
questions
because
we
don’t
know
what
the
answer
would
been
in
further
cross-examination.
the
critical
point,
the
essential
point
that
we're
making
is
the
jury
was
never
permitted
to
consider
what
pressures
green
was
under
when
he
made
the
initial
identification
at
the
station
house.
mr.
merriner
has
urged
what
he
characterizes
a
corroboration
argument
in
which
he
cites
much
evidence
that
didn't
even
go
to
jury.
the
proper
test
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
is
harmless
error,
a
constitutional
error
was
committed,
was
it
harmless?
can
we
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
one
juror
would
not
have
been
affected
by
this
information
and
i
submit
that
we
cannot.
the
jury
was
out
seven
hours
as
it
was.
the
evidence
that
was
cited
--
well,
when
we're
dealing
with
harmless
error
i
think,
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
usually
harmless
error
is
referring
to
tainted
evidence,
that
should
have
been
kept
out.
is
there
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
any
way
without
this?
in
this
case,
it's
exculpatory
evidence
that
the
jury
should
have
been
made
aware
of
in
a
little
different
situation
and
i
think
this
situation
that
was
discussed
in
the
case
(inaudible),
a
1971
case.
would
the
jury
have
been
affected
by
this
information?
can
we
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
jury
would
not
have
come
in
with
a
verdict,
that
this
would
not
have
raised
a
reasonable
doubt
in
their
mind?
in
the
corroboration
argument,
mr.
merriner
cites
and
backs
again
that
we
are
not
even
to
the
jury.
fibers
on
a
safe
had
matched
the
coat,
this
information
was
contained
in
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant,
never
submitted
to
the
jury.
rolls
of
bills
and
the
search
warrant
never
submitted
to
the
jury,
extension
of
the
contract
and
the
affidavit
for
search
warrant
never
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
of
the
rental
agreement,
yes.
these
are
not
proper
considerations
when
we're
discussing
harmless
error,
not
--
well
is
this
person
probably
guilty
or
looking
at
the
evidence
that
could
have
been
presented,
can
we
determine
whether
it’s
sufficient
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
guilt?
because
we
don’t
know
these
rulings,
how
the
trial
judge
would
have
ruled,
whether
this
information
is
admissible
in
the
first
place?
whether
in
fact,
the
fibers
did
match.
perhaps,
there
was
an
identification
by
an
fbi
expert
that
said,
they
did
not
match.
we
don’t
know
this.
so
that
information
cannot
be
considered,
and
i
think,
it’s
pretty
clearly
improper.
harmless
error
is
important
also
because
the
crime
was
burglary
and
larceny
that
he
was
convicted
of,
not
possession
of
stolen
property.
all
the
information
that
was
the
incriminating
evidence
if
it
can
be
characterized
that
which
really
incriminated
mr.
davis's
car
only
indicated
that
there
was
stolen
property
in
the
car,
not
that
the
burglary
and
larceny
have
been
committed,
because
there
were
other
fingerprints
found
at
the
scene,
not
his.
and
that’s
why
green’s
testimony
was
particularly
essential
that
he
established
a
link
in
the
prosecution’s
chain
of
evidence
of
recent
possession
and
his
testimony,
absent
his
testimony
there
could
have
been
a
conviction.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
am
saying
both,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
that
any
time
someone
is
testifying
against
the
accused
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
that
if
they
have
a
juvenile
record,
the
defense
has
a
right
to
bring
this
out
for
whatever
weight
it
might
have
to
the
jury.
that
fact
alone,
in
some
cases
it
could
be
very
relevant.
for
instance
in
the
alfred
fact
situation,
that
could
be
very
relevant,
but
that’s
for
the
jury
to
decide.
but
we
are
even
one
step
more
persuasive
than
that.
here
we
can
show
specific
reason
for
why
the
juvenile
record
should
be
brought
out.
i
think
in
conclusion
that
is--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
i
argued--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
argued
both,
mr.
justice
stewart,
to
the
supreme
court
i
am
arguing
now
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
be
brought
out
in
all
circumstances
when
someone
is
testifying
against
the
accused
in
a
criminal
proceeding
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
some
really
wild
fact
situation
that
where
it
would
be
terribly
abusive,
but
absent
that,
that
it
should
be
brought
out
and
let
the
jury
determine
whether
this
person
in
his
own
mind
would
have
some,
hold
the
benefit
of
his
position
with
the
prosecution,
the
government
is
offering
him
as
a
witness.
that’s
for
the
jury
to
decide
and
again
in
this
case,
it’s
much,
much
stronger
because
we
can
make
a
very
persuasive
argument
to
the
jury--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
the
per
se
rule,
yes
michigan
has
adopted
it.
although
the
mississippi
case,
the
hamburg
case,
the
trial
court
there
permitted
testimony,
the
cross-examination
showing
that
there
have
been
some
supervision
by
juvenile
authorities
but
they
felt
that
the
record
itself
shouldn’t
have
been
offered,
but
clearly
the
michigan
court,
the
three
cases
that
i
cited,
have
adopted
a
per
se
rule.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case
is
the
virtual
confrontation
of
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
against
a
state
statute
and
court
rule
which
provides
that
juvenile
record
shall
remain
secret
and
anonymous
in
virtually
all
cases,
save
when
the
juvenile
is
being
sentenced
as
an
adult
and
the
court
in
its
discretion
feels
that
the
juvenile
record
would
be
relevant
or
desirable.
in
this
particular
case,
the
statute
and
court
rule
was
applied
when
a
juvenile
was
testifying
for
the
prosecution
as
a
chief
identification
witness
against
the
accused,
petitioner
davis.
now
we
sought
at
trial
to
use
this
--
his
juvenile
record,
not
simply
to
impeach
his
character
with
prior
wrongful
acts,
but
rather
to
show
that
he
had
biased,
prejudiced
and
was
testifying
out
of
fear
and
favor
when
he
identified
petitioner
joshua
davis
at
trial.
the
court's
protective
order
or
the
court
entered
a
protective
order,
the
trial
court
did,
during
the
voir
dire
examination
for
the
jurors
and
at
that
time,
the
issues
were
fully
raised
or
actually
presented
in
our
briefs
today.
the
confrontation
issue
was
argued
to
the
trial
court.
there
has
here
been
a
significant
diminution
of
cross-examination
and
this
calls
into
question
integrity
of
the
whole
fact-finding
process
and
requires
that
the
competing
interest
be
closely
examined.
the
facts
of
the
davis
case
really
bespeak
the
legal
issues
raised.
a
safe
was
found
on
some
property
next
to
a
truck,
approximately
25
miles
from
north
of
anchorage,
alaska.
the
stepson
of
the
owner
of
this
property,
owned
this
particular
truck
and
was
on
a
probation
for
burglary
as
a
juvenile.
he
had
committed
acts
which
should
he
have
been
an
adult
would
be
burglary.
he
had
been
adjudicated
a
juvenile
delinquent
and
was
under
probation
at
that
time
to
the
juvenile
court,
he
was
sixteen
years
of
age
and
lived
on
this
particular
property.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
to
our
knowledge,
we
never
actually
were
provided
with
the
record
at
that
time,
but
the
respondent
has
admitted
in
essence
what
i
have
just
related
to
the
court
in
their
particular
brief,
we
don't
believe
that's
at
issue.
we
desired
to
bring
this
fact
out
to
the
jury
in
order
to
show
that
this
witness
was
initially
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
be
linked
into
a
burglary
charge
himself
because
this
witness
turned
out
to
be
the
key
critical
identification
witness
and
indeed
the
one
essential
witness
had
trialled
against
joshua
davis.
the
story
that
mr.
green,
the
boy
green
gave
to
the
police
officers
when
they
came
up
to
investigate
the
situation
was
that
earlier
in
the
day
he
had
been
walking
in
the
area
where
the
safe
was
found
and
observed
two
black
men
to
be
standing
near
a
recent,
a
late-model
chevrolet
automobile
metallic
in
color.
he
said
that
he
talked
to
them
briefly
and
asked
what
they
were
doing
there
and
he
asked
they
had
any
trouble
and
they
related
that
they
just
said
something
to
him,
“is
your
father
here?”
he
progressed.
he
said
no.
he
progressed
and
came
back
later
and
stated
that
he
observed
these
two
men
on
same
position,
one
with
a
crowbar.
he
stated
that
he
probably
could
identify
them.
the
next
day
green
was
taken
down
to
the
police
station
in
anchorage
and
apparently
coercive
environment
to
begin
with,
coupled
with
this,
he
was
taken
into
a
small
room
in
the
presence
of
four
detectives,
seated
between
the
two
chief
--
the
two
actual
investigating
officers,
one
of
them
was
packaging
pistols
apparently
in
connection
with
another
case
and
given
either
five
or
six
photographs
and
asked
to
see
if
he
could
identify
one
or
both
of
the
persons
that
he
claimed
to
have
seen
standing
where
this
safe
was
found.
now
at
this
particular
point
in
time,
our
theory
of
the
case
and
the
one
that
we
were
precluded
from
presenting
to
the
jury
was
that
green
was
under
a
lot
of
pressure
then
to
identify
someone
else.
he
in
his
own
mind
if
not
actually
was
a
suspect
of
this
burglary
and
was
under
strong
impetus
to
in
fact
pick
someone
out
of
these
photographs
in
order
to
take
the
heat
off
of
himself.
again,
the
jury
was
not
aware
of
these
circumstances.
he
did
in
fact
take
a
picture
out,
one
of
which
was
the
picture
of
joshua
davis.
there
was
a
subsequent
line
up
and
then
an
identification
at
trial.
our
point
is
that
when
this
initial
photographic
identification
was
made,
green
was
then
and
from
that
point
forward
locked
into
this
identification
and
this
was
the
critical
point
in
time
when
the
identification
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
in
the
trial?
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
i
did
not.
an
objection
was
made
at
that
time
when
i
asked
that
question.
there
was
a
negative
response.
that
objection
was
incomplete,
attempting
to
raise
in
the
jury's
mind
and
the
court
said
simply
i'll
sustain
the
objection
and
at
that
point
i
believe
that
the
court
and
the
record
reflects
was
referring
to
its
prior
protective
order
that
we
couldn't
get
into
that
particular
area.
respondent
attempts
to
limit
the
meaning
of
that
question
with
the
words
like
that.
i
think
when
the
question
is
read
in
conjunction
with
the
prior
questions
which
was
and
then
you
went
into
the
investigating
room
with
investigator
gray
and
investigator
weaver,
yeah,
and
they
started
asking
you
questions
about
the
incident,
is
that
correct?
yeah.
have
you
ever
been
questioned
like
that
before
by
any
law
enforcement
officers?
the
answer
was
no.
again,
we
feel
that
this
answer
itself
was
--
must
have
been
untruthful
and
we
were
precluded
from
showing
this
to
the
jury.
also
we
not
only
were
prohibited
from
cross-examining
green
on
this
point,
but
the
police
investigators
as
well
with
respect
to
particular
pressures
they
may
have
put
on
green
at
the
time
of
the
initial
photographic
identification.
particularly
investigator
gray
was
asked,
did
you
at
any
time
suspect
green
to
be
involved
in
this
burglary?
he
responded
no.
cross-examination
at
that
point
was
precluded
on
how
is
your
negative
response
consistent
with
your
knowledge
that
he
in
fact
was
a
juvenile
on
probation
for
burglary.
the
safe
was
found
on
his
land
next
to
his
truck.
again
that
question
was
precluded.
the
prosecution
at
trial
made
the
most
of
their
protective
order.
the
jury
was
in
essence
given
a
distorted
view
of
exactly
what
green
was
and
who
he
was.
the
protective
order
of
course
came
during
the
voir
dire
examination,
so
any
mention
of
the
problem,
the
juvenile
record
would
not
come
before
the
jury.
in
closing
the
argument,
the
prosecution
stated
that
the
petitioner's
entire
defense,
which
--
our
entire
defense
was
that
the
green's
identification
was
unreliable,
that
he
was
under
pressure.
we
tried
to
show
just
by
the
fact
that
he
was
--
the
safe
was
found
on
his
property
next
to
his
truck
that
he
would
be
under
pressure.
that
was
our
defense,
this
was
developed
an
opening
statement
throughout
the
trial
and
closing
argument.
the
prosecution
in
the
closing
argument
claimed
that
this
was
a
total
red
herring
issue,
one
that
we
had
just
made
up
and
that
there
is
no
basis
for
this
belief.
he
also
said
and
i
am
referring
to
pages
422
and
424
of
the
transcript
that
our
defense
of
bias
and
prejudice
in
fear
and
favor
on
part
of
green
came
as
a
result
of
pure
suspicion
of
society
and
suspicion
of
law
enforcement
officers.
of
course,
the
prosecutor
must
have
known
in
his
own
mind,
at
least,
the
origins
of
our
attack
on
witness
green's
credibility
and
any
bias
or
any
fear
and
favor
he
had
in
testifying,
that
came
from
other
independent
sources
than
that.
as
a
result
of
green's
identification
at
the
station
house,
his
search
warrant
was
obtained
for
the
car
belonging
to
petitioner
joshua
davis.
a
search
was
made
of
records
of
rental
car
agencies,
the
police
suspected
because
of
the
description
of
the
car,
maybe
it
is
a
rental
car.
they
found
the
car
rented
to
petitioner,
obtained
a
search
warrant
for
the
premises,
his
house
and
also
vehicle.
as
a
result
of
this
search,
they
found
evidence
inferentially
relating
petitioner's
car
to
being
present
perhaps
at
the
scene
or
actually
with
having
had
a
safe,
perhaps,
in
the
trunk
of
the
rented
car
at
one
time
as
to
extent
of
the
other
evidence
presented
against
petitioner
at
trial.
the
actual
evidence
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
were
insulation
fibers
that
could
have
come
from
a
safe
and
paint
chips
that
could
have
come
from
the
safe.
this
was
the
extent
of
the
identification
of
these
particular
substances.
there
was
no
--
there
were
no
fibers
or
paint
chips
found
on
petitioner's
clothing
or
on
shoes
or
nor
was
the
money
found
that
was
allegedly
in
the
safe.
none
of
the
things
that
the
search
warrant
basically
was
seeking
were
ever
found,
just
these
small
items
of
evidence.
this
is
important,
of
course,
to
lead
to
the
significance
of
green's
identification,
the
crucial
nature,
the
essential
nature
of
his
testimony.
its
essential
nature,
i
do
not
believe
is
actually
in
dispute.
it
was
admitted
at
trial
during
the
motion
for
a
protective
order
described
as
essential
witness
with
that
very
word.
also,
the
alaska
supreme
court
in
their
opinion
described
him
as
an
essential
witness,
that
the
case
could
not
have
been
made
without
him.
the
trial
judge
ruled
on
the
issue,
on
the
basis
strictly
of
the
state
statute
and
the
rule
involved.
he
initially
was
inclined
to
rule
in
our
favor
as
the
record
reflects
and
stated
when
he
reversed
himself
that
he
really
didn't
agree
with
what
he
was
doing,
but
he
felt
constrained
to
do
so
by
a
specific
court
rule
in
alaska
and
which
is
cited,
of
course,
he
is
doing--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
his
juvenile
record?
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
absolutely
not.
his
record
would
not
be,
he
did
not
testify
for
one
thing,
but
assuming
that
if
he
had
testified
then
the
state
statute
would
have
prohibited
and
the
rule
prohibited
from
being
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
as
it
should
be.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
the
different
is
what?
well,
in
this
case,
that
green
was
not
being
accused
of
anything,
the
record
was
not
sought
to
be
used
against
him
strictly.
it
was
sought
to
be
used
to
impeach
his
credibility,
not
even
necessarily
to
attack
his
character,
but
that
he
was
testifying
under
fear
and
favor
and
if
there
is
any
conflict
between
that
particular
state
law
and
rule
in
the
sixth
amendment,
then
the
statute
and
rule
must
exceed
to
the
sixth
amendment,
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
green's
credibility,
yes,
and
to
show
that
he
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes
it
is.
we
are
talking
about
impeachment
and
credibility.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
we
weren't
using
it
under
the
state
rule
of
evidence
which
provides
that
impeachment
of
character
may
come
about
by
showing
a
specific
bad
action
and
we
weren't
attempting
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
the
distinction
that
i
would
make
is
that
would
be
an
attack
on
the
witness's
character.
in
this
case,
we
wanted
to
make
a
specific
attack
on
his
credibility
to
show
bias
and
prejudice.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes.
that
--
there
would
be
two
parts
to
what
his
special
motive
for
the
identification
would
be.
the
first
part
would
be
to
take
the
pressure
off
himself
when
he
made
that
initial
identification
shortly
after
the
safe
was
discovered
on
his
property
next
to
his
trunk,
that
he
was
very
anxious
to
do
that,
that
the
investigation
be
turned
away
from
him,
at
least,
as
he
thought
in
his
own
mind,
and
secondly,
that
he
would
have
impetus
to
testify
just
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
was
on
probation
and
would
somehow
hope
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
i
don't
think
i
understand
your
question,
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
have
tried
to
cover
that
somewhat
in
my
reply
brief
that
when
the
term
impeachment
and
the
term
attack
on
credibility
have
been
used
somewhat
interchangeably
and
i
tried
to
distinguish
them
at
least
for
purposes
of
my
argument
in
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
in
support
of
our
position
also
make
that
distinction.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
don't
think
that
the
alaska
supreme
court
was
limiting
themselves
to
strictly
impeachment
in
the
terms
of
the
particular
civil
rule.
i
think,
they
were
talking
about
a
general
impeachment
attack
and
i
think
that
to
define
under
two
subheadings,
under
the
word
impeachment,
attack
against
character
and
attack
against
credibility.
the
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
agree
with
that
completely
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
what
report
must
have
made
was
using
--
they're
using
the
term
impeachment
as
a
word
of
art,
particularly,
and
i
cited
it
in
the
first
part
of
my
brief
under
alaska
civil
rule
43.
it
talks
about
impeachment
by
an
adverse
party
and
then
it
goes
on
that
a
party
may
not
be
impeached
by
evidence
of
wrong,
particular
wrongful
acts
except
that
it
maybe
shown
by
the
examination
of
the
witness
or
the
record
of
a
judgment
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
talking
about
then.
we
weren't
attempting
to
do
that,
although,
as
i've
argued
in
my
brief
i
think
that
that
even
should
be
allowed
and
let
the
jury
determine
the
particular
significance.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
wasn't
pushing
for
that
and
we
aren't
pushing
for
that
now
because
it's
not
necessary
in
this
case,
but
i
think
it
should
be.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
that
simply
this
person
is
a
bad
person.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
it
does
not
and
of
course
there
is
a
perceptible
trend
in
that
direction,
but
we
were
not
limiting,
we
were
not
offering
it
solely
for
that
purpose
and
actually
that
was
the
secondary
purpose.
the
primary
purpose
was
to
show
that
this
witness
in
his
own
mind,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
was
on
probation
for
burglary
would
feel
that
he
was
a
suspect.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
it
could
be
--
his
mind
is
what
is
critical
and
the
jury
should
be
allowed
to
determine
what
factors
were
present
in
his
mind,
what
pressures
he
would
feel.
we
relied
very
heavily
on
of
course
two
cases
where
this
is
discussed
greatly
off
a
case
in
smith
versus
illinois
and
i
think
those
cases
are
directly
applicable
here.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
no,
i
think
that's
absolutely
correct
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
what
they
found,
but,
of
course,
the
questions
that
were
permitted
were
only
self-serving
general
questions
such
as
did
you
feel
you
are
under
pressure
mr.
green,
do
you
feel
you
might
be
a
suspect?
questions
like
this
which
he
answered
negatively,
which
he
would
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
but
that's
the
extent
of
it.
we
could
not
bring
it
home
to
the
juries
as
the
chief
justice
rabinowitz
points
out
in
his
dissent,
the
pressures
that
green
must
have
had
felt
in
his
own
mind
and
when
he
denied
that
he
felt
these
pressures
and
when
he
denied
that
he
had
ever
been
questioned
by
a
police
officer
before.
these
were
questions
that
were
ripe
for
exposure
and
cross-examination
that
the
witness
either
had
a
very
bad
memory
or
was
lying
or
whatever
other
reasons
can
be
expressed.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
it
was
not
my
objection.
it
was
--
i
think,
the
demotion
would
have
been
made
--
that
motion
to
strike
would
have
been
made
by
the
person
making
the
objection,
the
prosecutor.
i
think
that
the
normal
trial
practice
is
let
the
answer
stand,
it's
been
made.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
well,
i
didn't
know
was
of
course.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
you
know
i
would
be
bound
by
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
the
order,
protective
order
--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes
your
honor,
thank
you.
now
with
respect
to
a
follow-up
on
that
particular
answer,
whether
that
should
have
been
done
at
trial,
i
think
you
should
look
back
to
the
court’s
initial
ruling,
the
--
when
the
protective
order
was
asked
for,
it
was
unequivocal,
it
cited,
the
court
says,
you
didn’t
want
to
go
in
this
area
at
all.
we
were
getting
into
that
area
a
little
bit
and
that’s
why
perhaps
it
was
not
pursued
at
that
time.
i
don’t
think
that
particular
question
is
essential.
it’s
another
--
it's
another
reason
why
cross-examination
should
have
been
allowed
on
that
particular
issue.
of
course,
we
never
know
again
what
the
cross-examination
of
his
record
would
have
revealed
and
that’s
the
whole
reason
of
permitting
cross-examination.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
would
say
what
prevented
me
from
doing
that
was
the
court's
indication
of
the
rule
on
protective
order
that
you
essentially
felt
that
his
juvenile
record
was
invalid,
that’s
how
i
will
answer
that
question,
i
do
answer
it.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
that,
perhaps,
could
have
been
done
and
again,
the
reason
why
i
would
not,
is
because
of
the
protective
order
was
interpreted
and
the
force
of
it
and
the
rapid
objection
and
the
sustaining
of
it.
again,
the
critical
issue
are
not
these
particular
questions
because
we
don’t
know
what
the
answer
would
been
in
further
cross-examination.
the
critical
point,
the
essential
point
that
we're
making
is
the
jury
was
never
permitted
to
consider
what
pressures
green
was
under
when
he
made
the
initial
identification
at
the
station
house.
mr.
merriner
has
urged
what
he
characterizes
a
corroboration
argument
in
which
he
cites
much
evidence
that
didn't
even
go
to
jury.
the
proper
test
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
is
harmless
error,
a
constitutional
error
was
committed,
was
it
harmless?
can
we
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
one
juror
would
not
have
been
affected
by
this
information
and
i
submit
that
we
cannot.
the
jury
was
out
seven
hours
as
it
was.
the
evidence
that
was
cited
--
well,
when
we're
dealing
with
harmless
error
i
think,
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
usually
harmless
error
is
referring
to
tainted
evidence,
that
should
have
been
kept
out.
is
there
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
any
way
without
this?
in
this
case,
it's
exculpatory
evidence
that
the
jury
should
have
been
made
aware
of
in
a
little
different
situation
and
i
think
this
situation
that
was
discussed
in
the
case
(inaudible),
a
1971
case.
would
the
jury
have
been
affected
by
this
information?
can
we
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
jury
would
not
have
come
in
with
a
verdict,
that
this
would
not
have
raised
a
reasonable
doubt
in
their
mind?
in
the
corroboration
argument,
mr.
merriner
cites
and
backs
again
that
we
are
not
even
to
the
jury.
fibers
on
a
safe
had
matched
the
coat,
this
information
was
contained
in
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant,
never
submitted
to
the
jury.
rolls
of
bills
and
the
search
warrant
never
submitted
to
the
jury,
extension
of
the
contract
and
the
affidavit
for
search
warrant
never
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
of
the
rental
agreement,
yes.
these
are
not
proper
considerations
when
we're
discussing
harmless
error,
not
--
well
is
this
person
probably
guilty
or
looking
at
the
evidence
that
could
have
been
presented,
can
we
determine
whether
it’s
sufficient
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
guilt?
because
we
don’t
know
these
rulings,
how
the
trial
judge
would
have
ruled,
whether
this
information
is
admissible
in
the
first
place?
whether
in
fact,
the
fibers
did
match.
perhaps,
there
was
an
identification
by
an
fbi
expert
that
said,
they
did
not
match.
we
don’t
know
this.
so
that
information
cannot
be
considered,
and
i
think,
it’s
pretty
clearly
improper.
harmless
error
is
important
also
because
the
crime
was
burglary
and
larceny
that
he
was
convicted
of,
not
possession
of
stolen
property.
all
the
information
that
was
the
incriminating
evidence
if
it
can
be
characterized
that
which
really
incriminated
mr.
davis's
car
only
indicated
that
there
was
stolen
property
in
the
car,
not
that
the
burglary
and
larceny
have
been
committed,
because
there
were
other
fingerprints
found
at
the
scene,
not
his.
and
that’s
why
green’s
testimony
was
particularly
essential
that
he
established
a
link
in
the
prosecution’s
chain
of
evidence
of
recent
possession
and
his
testimony,
absent
his
testimony
there
could
have
been
a
conviction.
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
am
saying
both,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
that
any
time
someone
is
testifying
against
the
accused
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
that
if
they
have
a
juvenile
record,
the
defense
has
a
right
to
bring
this
out
for
whatever
weight
it
might
have
to
the
jury.
that
fact
alone,
in
some
cases
it
could
be
very
relevant.
for
instance
in
the
alfred
fact
situation,
that
could
be
very
relevant,
but
that’s
for
the
jury
to
decide.
but
we
are
even
one
step
more
persuasive
than
that.
here
we
can
show
specific
reason
for
why
the
juvenile
record
should
be
brought
out.
i
think
in
conclusion
that
is--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
yes,
i
argued--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
i
argued
both,
mr.
justice
stewart,
to
the
supreme
court
i
am
arguing
now
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
be
brought
out
in
all
circumstances
when
someone
is
testifying
against
the
accused
in
a
criminal
proceeding
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
some
really
wild
fact
situation
that
where
it
would
be
terribly
abusive,
but
absent
that,
that
it
should
be
brought
out
and
let
the
jury
determine
whether
this
person
in
his
own
mind
would
have
some,
hold
the
benefit
of
his
position
with
the
prosecution,
the
government
is
offering
him
as
a
witness.
that’s
for
the
jury
to
decide
and
again
in
this
case,
it’s
much,
much
stronger
because
we
can
make
a
very
persuasive
argument
to
the
jury--
mr.
robert
h.
wagstaff
the
per
se
rule,
yes
michigan
has
adopted
it.
although
the
mississippi
case,
the
hamburg
case,
the
trial
court
there
permitted
testimony,
the
cross-examination
showing
that
there
have
been
some
supervision
by
juvenile
authorities
but
they
felt
that
the
record
itself
shouldn’t
have
been
offered,
but
clearly
the
michigan
court,
the
three
cases
that
i
cited,
have
adopted
a
per
se
rule.
thank
you.
