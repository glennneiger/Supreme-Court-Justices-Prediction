chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-5794,
davis
against
alaska.
mr.
wagstaff,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
his
only
collision
with
the
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
leave
that
police
station
situation,
i
noticed
on
page
34
that
you
were
referring
to
earlier,
there
was
a
general
question
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
had
you
--
this
is
addressed
to
green,
had
you
been
questioned
like
that
before
by
any
law
enforcement
officer?
i
would
assume
for
the
moment
at
least
that
that
was
some
kind
of
an
effort
to
perhaps
lay
grounds
for
impeaching
him
and
he
answered
no,
when
in
fact
as
we
now
know
on
the
total
record,
if
he
had
been
involved
as
a
juvenile
and
was
on
probation,
he
must
have
been
at
some
time
interrogated
by
police
officers
in
the
past.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
pursue
that
by
way
of
any
impeachment
at
a
later
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
character.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
separate
those
two?
i
confess
that
i
could
not
understand
what
the
supreme
court
opinion
meant
when
they
said
that
you
were
not
attacking
impeachment
but
whatever
name
you
will
call
it,
if
you
try
to
underline
the
jury's
acceptance
of
the
testimony
given,
it
is
impeachment,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
maybe
that
you
weren't
quite
pushing
for
that
in
the
state
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
merriner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
merriner,
we
now
know,
do
we
not,
that
on
page
34
he
did
answer
one
question
falsely?
whether
it
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that
it
was
a
false
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
it
was?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
then
if
that
extraordinary,
very
extraordinary
suggestion
that
you
make
were
possibly
true
that
they
didn't
question
him,
isn't
that
something
that
might
appropriately
been
the
scope
of
further
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course,
have
there
been
the
usual
scope
of
cross-examination,
we
might
have
a
record
that
would
disclose
some
reasons
that
we
can
now
only
speculate
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
are
you,
are
you
really
not
so
getting
pretty
close
if
not
on
a
harmless
error
argument
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
trial
judge
heard
his
answer
that
he
had
never
been
questioned,
if
not,
should
that
not
have
suggested
to
the
trial
judge
that
here
was
an
area
in
which
the
witness
was
not
being
completely
candid
with
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
mr.
wagstaff
then
should
have
asked
for
opportunity
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
pursue
the
cross-examination,
in
some
way,
that
would
lay
a
foundation
for
an
exception
to
the
alaska
rule
on
confrontation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
the
very
least
it
was
a
very
ambiguous
answer,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
it
was
the
duty
of
defense
counsel
to
pursue
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
merriner,
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
wagstaff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
anything
that
prevent
you
from
asking
the
court
to
give
you
a
hearing
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
pursue
your
question
on
page
34
which
at
least
was
very
ambiguous,
you'd
agree
and
then
also
to
develop
what
were
the
detailed
conversations
between
the
police
and
this
witness,
green,
between
the
time
they
first
contacted
him
and
the
day
of
the
trial
to
see
if,
for
example,
there
was
any
suggestion
that
if
he
didn’t
cooperate,
they
would
refer
this
to
his
probation
officer
or
other
comparable,
anything
to
prevent
you
from
doing
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
preserved
the
confidentiality
of
that
by
taking
this
kind
of
thing
in
chambers,
but
on
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in

alaska
for

stated
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning.

of
