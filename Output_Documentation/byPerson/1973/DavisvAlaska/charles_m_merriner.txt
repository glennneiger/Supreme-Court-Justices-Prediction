mr.
charles
m.
merriner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
read
this
court's
confrontation
cases
in
determining
the
damage
that
has
been
done
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process,
i
see
that
the
focus
is
on
two
things.
one
is
the
cruciality
of
the
un-confronted
testimony
and
the
other
is
that
this
court
likes
to
see
just
how
mislead
the
fact-finder
has
been
by
not
hearing
the
confrontation
that
has
been
denied.
and
i
must
concede
that
richard
green's
testimony
was
crucial
to
the
state's
case
against
joshua
davis.
my
argument
is
that
the
jury
was
not
significantly
mislead
by
the
denial
of
cross-examination,
by
not
having
heard
about
the
juvenile
record
and
by
not
hearing
cross-examination
in
this
area.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
no,
your
honor.
my
argument
is
that
the
testimony
was
reliable
enough
that
the
jurors
were
authorized
to
hear
it,
even
though
they
did
not
hear
these
facts
that
impeached
the
testimony
and
they
did
not
hear
cross-examination
in
that
area.
in
determining
just
how
mislead
the
jurors
were,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
here
at
the
outset
that
richard
green
was
on
the
stand,
he
was
immediately
cross-examined,
in
all
areas
except
this
one.
he
was
under
oath.
the
jury
was
able
to
observe
this
man's
demeanor
as
he
testified
and
although
mr.
wagstaff
could
not
cross-examine
him
in
this
one
area,
he
was
able
to
bring
out
questions
concerning
whether
or
not
this
person
thought
himself
to
be
under
suspicion
and
therefore,
whether
or
not
he
had
a
motive
to
quickly
identify
somebody
else
or
to
fabricate
his
story
in
order
to
help
himself
in
some
way.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
i
would
dispute
that
your
honor
and
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
mr.
chief
justice
i
pointed
out
in
footnote
3
on
my
brief,
it's
on
page
13
that
this
response
was
not
untruthful
because
this
inquiry
referred
to
being
questioned
as
a
prospective
witness
and
not
as
a
prospective
accused.
the
words
were,
have
you
ever
been
questioned
like
that
before?
this
man
was
a
witness
and
he
was
not
a
prospective
accused.
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
police
officers
questioned
him
at
all
when
he
was
picked
up
for
his
juvenile
violation.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
when
this
question
was
answered
in
this
way,
if
mr.
wagstaff
had
thought
here
that
there
was
perjury
involved,
he
could
have
asked
for
the
jury
to
be
excused,
could
have
gone
into
this
further,
but
there
was
an
objection
of
mr.
ripley,
the
prosecuting
attorney
said,
i
am
going
to
object
to
this,
your
honor.
it's
a
carry
on
with
rehash
of
the
same
thing.
he
is
attempting
to
the
raise
in
the
jury's
mind.
court
simply
said,
i
will
sustain
the
objection.
mr.
wagstaff
at
that
time
could
have
made
an
offer
of
proof,
an
offer
of
proof
that
perjury
had
been
committed.
and
if
he
could
have
shown
that,
then
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
have
had
to
have
allowed
in
this
juvenile
record,
because
if
you
have
got
perjury
on
the
stand,
certainly,
the
defense
counsel
should
be
able
to
impeach
with
whatever
means
is
necessary
to
bring
out
the
fact
that
there
has
been
perjury
on
the
stand.
as
the
record
now
stands
and
he
has
never
raised
this.
in
his
brief
he
simply
says
in
this
one
statement,
counsel
asked
if
he
had
ever
been
questioned
before
by
law
enforcement
officers?
his
answer
was,
no.
and
he
doesn't
say
in
there,
just
show
that
the
man
purged
himself,
the
implications
raised,
of
course,
and
that's
the
reason
i
have
put
in
my
footnote
3,
but
as
to
final
draw
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
oh,
yes,
but
of
course,
a
rule
cannot
stand
if
it's
unconstitutional
for
its
application,
to
be
--
for
it
to
be
applied
and
there
is
another
rule
in
the
alaska
criminal
rules,
rule
57
which
says
that
in
the
interest
of
justice,
we
can't
dispense
with
any
of
the
foregoing
rules.
the
rule
would
i
submit
have
had
to
have
been
abandoned
at
that
point,
if
during
the
offer
of
proof,
it
had
come
out
that
richard
green
had
perjured
himself
by
the
statement,
then
i
would
think
that
defense
counsel
would
have
been
able
to
bring
out
the
juvenile
record
at
that
point
or
his
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him
would
be
denied.
but
mr.
wagstaff
in
getting
off
this
point,
was
able
to
question
closely
about
whether
or
not
richard
green
considered
himself
under
suspicion.
and
as
the
alaska
supreme
court
stressed,
the
jury
was
able
to
observe
his
demeanor
while
he
was
being
questioned
this
way.
the
facts
that
work
out
from
the
jurors
did
somewhat
impeach
richard
green's
testimony
the
fact
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
did
somewhat
impugn
his
credibility
that's
being
a
larcenous
type
crime,
a
burglary
of
two
cabins.
the
fact
that
he
was
on
probation
showed
that
he
had
somewhat
of
a
motive
to
quickly
identify
somebody
else
to
hoist
the
blame
onto
someone
else
to
take
the
suspicion
that
he
felt
was
on
himself
or
perhaps
even
to
fabricate
his
story
in
order
to
aid
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
enforcement
people
he
had
to
deal
with.
but,
these
facts
are
not
that
impeaching
in
themselves.
as
for
the
argument
that
the
conviction
it
show
--
itself
impeaches
his
credibility
in
the
sense
that
this
was
a
larcenous
type
crime.
mr.
wagstaff
is
not
relying
much
upon
this
argument.
as
mr.
justice
white
was
bringing
out,
the
alaska
supreme
court,
indicated
in
the
opinion
that
this
was
not
mr.
wagstaff's
main
argument
that
it
should
have
been
brought
in
as
a
conviction
itself
to
impeach
credibility.
he
has
a
further
argument,
that
is,
that
there
was
a
motive
here
because
of
the
probation.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
mentioned
the
possibility
of
totally
abolishing
for
any
witness,
the
use
of
prior
records.
now
in
february
this
year,
alaska
--
the
alaska
supreme
court
did
promulgate
a
rule,
that
says
you
cannot
use
for
any
witness,
any
criminal
conviction
if
it
is
over
five
years
old.
i
can
see
problems
there.
if
there
is
a
perjury
conviction
and
that's
six
years
old
in
the
state's
witness
as
the
perjury
conviction
behind
him,
is
a
crucial
witness.
i
can
definitely
see
there
are
problems
that
the
defense
counsel
would
be
denied
his
right
to
confront,
if
he
could
not
answer
a
question.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
if
by
not
being
allowed
to
go
into
this
area,
the
jury
is
rather
greatly
misled
about
the
reliability
of
his
testimony,
that
testimony
is
crucial,
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
well,
i
know
in
washington
v.
texas,
this
court
stressed
the
fact
that
they
were
no
way
indicating
that
these
privileges
were
being
questioned.
but
i
could
see
the
possibility
of
the
defense
knowing
about
some
communication
made
to
a
husband,
wife
is
on
the
stand,
crucial
state's
witness.
some
communication
that
you
know,
she
tells
him,
i
am
going
to
get
up
on
the
stand
and
lie
and
i
can
see
there
that
if
the
state
just
went
ahead
and
applied
the
rule
without
any
much
consideration
about,
i
can
see
that
the
denial
of
confrontation
wouldn't
exist
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
no,
mr.
justice--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
i
am
arguing
here
that
the
focus
should
be
--
the
test
should
on
the
cruciality
of
the
testimony
to
just
how
misled
were
the
jurors.
now,
this
test
will
apply
to
any
fact
situation
or
apply
to
any
privilege
his
equity
of
privilege
whatever
and
it
maybe
that
all
rules
in
some
situations
would
have
to
fall.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
assuming
the
court
does
not
on
its
own
do
so.
now,
as
to
the
impeaching
quality
of
the
fact
that
richard
green
was
on
probation.
the
record
contains
no
indication
that
he
stood
to
gain
anything
significant
at
all
by
his
actions.
the
record
contains
no
indication
that
he
in
anyway
was
involved
in
that
burglary
that
he
stood
to
separate
probation
obligation.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
in
light
of
how
impeaching
these
facts
were
generally,
which
i
have
submit
are
not
that
impeaching
and
in
light
of
the
extensive
corroboration
of
this
man's
testimony,
it
seems
apparent
that
any
further
cross-examination
into
this
area
would
not
have
raised
any
hidden
doubts
in
the
jurors'
minds,
doubts
that
are
not
present
in
this
record.
this
extensive
corroboration
shows
that
his
testimony
would
not
have
cracked
under
further
examination.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
let
me
go
into
just
how
corroborative
this
testimony
was
and
i
think
that
when
you
realize
just
how
corroborated
it
was,
then
you
will
see
that
by
asking
these
further
questions,
that
testimony
would
not
have
been
changed.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
in
these
confrontation
cases,
that's
the
question
that
has
to
be
asked,
just
what
would
the
jurors
have
thought.
the
test
is
what
the
average
juror
would
have
thought,
an
average
(inaudible)
brings
up,
but
that
is
the
question
has
to
be
asked.
now
the
confrontation
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
it's
even
colder
than
this
up
then.[laughter]
but,
if
we
look
at
just
how
corroborated
his
testimony
was,
we'll
see
that
these
hidden
doubts
would
not
have
been
raised
by
further
examination,
any
significant
hidden
doubt.
now,
perhaps
most
importantly,
there
was
a
story
given
to
the
trooper
on
the
very
day
that
the
burglary
occurred
on
the
very
day
that
the
safe
was
found
out
at
his
stepfather's
property.
and
he
said
i
saw
these
two
men
beside
a
late
model,
metallic
blue,
chevrolet
sedan.
the
very
next
day
he
went
down
to
police
station.
he
picked
out,
out
of
six
pictures,
and
i
believe
the
record
will
show
that,
i
know
will
show
that
the
alaska
supreme
court
opinion
is
wrong
in
that
respect,
there
were
six
pictures.
they
are
identified
in
the
record,
exhibits
25-30
i
believe.
he
picked
out
and
also
the
alaska
supreme
court
opinion
is
wrong
when
it
says,
he
picked
two
pictures,
he
picked
out
one
picture,
the
record
will
show.
so
he
picked
out
of
six
pictures,
the
picture
of
the
petitioner.
he
was
able
to
do
this
even
though
it
was
ten
years
old.
he
did
not
show
the
petitioner
with
a
mustache
in
the
picture.
although
at
the
scene
of
the
burglary
he
had
a
mustache
at
the
lineup,
two
days
after
the
photo
lineup
he
had
a
mustache
and
two
days
after
the
photo
identification
there
was
a
capoeira
lineup.
he
again
picked
the
man
out,
out
of
a
group
of
seven
men.
he
picked
two
men
at
that
time,
one
as
representing
the
other
man.
so
he
picked
joshua
davis,
and
as
it
turned
out
the
evidence
was
that
joshua
davis
had
rented
a
late
model
of
1969,
burglary
having
occurred
in
february
of
1970,
metallic
blue,
chevrolet
impala.
at
this
point,
maybe
i
should
mention
that
mr.
wagstaff
contends
that
there
was
a
coercive
atmosphere
there.
yet,
there
really
is
nothing
in
record,
that
shows
there
wasn't
anything
suggestive
about
the
photo
identification,
nothing
at
all.
he
was
in
a
room
down
at
the
police
station
true,
but
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
no
indication
was
made
during
the
pick
out
of
such
and
such
a
picture.
his
testimony
to
that
affect
is
none
to
the
contrary.
nothing
at
all
on
the
record
showing
that
the
photo
identification
was
suggestive.
there
is
lots
of
evidence
about
how
this
lineup
was
conducted,
again
nothing,
the
capoeira
(ph)
lineup,
nothing
indicated,
that
wasn't
anyway
suggested.
now,
not
only
did
he
rent
the
car
that
was
described,
but
the
police
developed
evidence
or
discovered
evidence
that
on
the
day
of
the
burglary,
shortly
afternoon,
joshua
davis
extended
the
rental
contract
by
paying
from
a
large
roll
of
bills,
$50,
and
two
rolls
of
quarter.
and
the
story
that
richard
green
had
given
was
that
he
had
seen
these
men
out
there
shortly
before
noon.
also,
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
there
were
paint
chips
and
fibers,
found
that,
i
submit,
virtually
conclusively
show
that
that
safe
was
in
that
trunk.
now
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
when
you
look
at
the
harmless
error
argument,
you
look
at
whether
or
not
the
jury
would
have
been
swayed
to
vote
differently,
if
it
had
heard
this
evidence.
now
i
have
just
given
you
some
evidence
that
the
jury
hasn't
even
heard,
that
is,
the
contract
extension.
jury
never
heard
about
that.
i
submit
that
the
test
is
whether
or
not
this
evidence
was
reliable,
viewing
all
that
we
know
about
this
testimony,
you
know,
all
we
know,
was
it
reliable
enough
so
that
this
jury
was
given
reliable
testimony
was
not
misled
as
to
this
testimony,
so
that
an
innocent
man
was
not
convicted.
it
is
not
an
harmless
error
argument
as
such
and
that
you
do
look
at
other
evidences,
aside
from
what
the
record
contains,
not
that
the
jury
heard.
mr.
wagstaff
says
that
all
that
the
paint
chips
and
fibers
showed
was
that,
a
safe
could
have
been
in
the
safe.
the
fbi
agent
told
about
performing
a
microchemical
analysis
on
the
fibers
and
he
said
that
he
had
never
found
this
particular
composition
materials
in
the
fibers
anywhere
within
safes.
he
compared
the
fibers
from
the
safe
with
the
fibers
in
the
trunk,
he
said
they
matched.
he
said
that
just
by
looking
at
the
fibers
in
the
trunk,
he
could
almost
conclude
for
sure
that
they
came
from
a
mosler
safe,
this
was
a
mosler
safe,
and
you
have
the
paint.
there
were
three
layers
of
paint.
again
a
microchemical
analysis
on
each
layer
was
the
same.
the
evidence
virtually
shows
beyond
any
doubt
that
that
trunk
did
contain
that
safe
at
one
time.
also,
richard
green,
when
he
first
told
the
story
to
the
trooper,
said
that
the
man
he
talked
with,
whom
he
later
identified
as
joshua
davis,
who
was
wearing
a
brown
or
black
mackinaw
jacket.
when
the
safe
was
later
examined,
there
was
found
to
be
of
little
reddish
brown
material
on
one
of
the
rough
edges
where
it
had
been
broken
into.
joshua
davis's
description
is
given
by
richard
green
did
not
vary
from
his
actual
description
and
as
to
the
tires
in
the
reply
brief,
mr.
wagstaff
said
that
i
unduly
relied
upon
the
evidence
concerning
the
tires.
there
were
two
sets
of
tire
tracks
out
there,
and
one
set
of
tire
tracks
went
up
to
where
the
safe
was
found.
there
had
been
a
snow
two
or
three
days
earlier.
these
were
the
only
tire
tracks
there.
the
officer
investigator
gray
testified
that
he
examined
the
two
sets
of
tire
tracks,
both
appeared
to
be
made
by
snow
tires.
the
two
tracks
had
been
made
by
different
vehicles
and
then
when
he
was
asked
by
mr.
wagstaff,
at
questioning,
he
said
the
snow
tires
on
the
rear
of
the
vehicle
appeared
to
be
the
same
and
he
met
there
and
it
was
clear
from
the
questioning,
appear
to
be
the
same
on
these
tracks
that
led
up
to
the
place
where
the
safe
was
dumped
off,
as
the
tires
on
the
back
of
the
vehicle.
so
you
have
all
this
corroboration.
the
other
fact
that
he
was
on
the
stand
and
the
jury
was
able
to
observe
his
demeanor,
he
was
under
oath
to
the
extent
that
he
was
cross-examined
and
his
testimony
contained
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability
to
justify
the
jury
having
heard
this
testimony
even
without
the
denied
cross-examination.
the
jury
still
possessed
a
satisfactory
basis
for
examining
the
truthfulness
of
this
testimony
and
joshua
davis
was
not
denied
a
fair
trial.
in
the
confrontation
cases
of
this
court,
the
thing
is
look
not
only
to
the
damage
done
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process,
but
the
cases
look
to
the
underlying
reasons
behind
the
denial
of
the
confrontation.
and
if
there
has
been
a
significant
misleading
of
the
jury
concerning
crucial
testimony,
that
reason
has
to
be
closely
examined.
in
this
case
the
jury
was
not
significantly
misled
concerning
the
crucial
testimony,
but
even
if
we
close
examine
the
--
closely
examine
the
reason
behind
denying
the
cross-examination
in
the
area,
the
juvenile
record
here,
it
will
bear
up
to
the
the
scrutiny.
if
juvenile
records
had
to
be
revealed
in
cases
that
would
not
benefit
in
which
it
would
not
benefit
the
defense,
anymore
than
it
would
have
in
this
case,
then
many
juvenile
records
will
have
to
be
revealed.
and,
of
course,
that
will
open
somewhat
of
the
breach
and
the
juvenile
system
structure
and
there
will
be
an
attempted
to
damage
to
the
system
as
such
and
it
will
adversely
affect
many
juvenile
witnesses
who
have
juvenile
--
many
witnesses
who
have
juvenile
records
and
it
will
especially
affect
us,
you
are
still
being
rehabilitated
at
the
time
they
have
to
take
the
stand
such
as
was
the
case
here
with
richard
green.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
i
would
like
to
argue
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
i
would
argue
for
a
per
se
rule
if
i
felt
that
i
analytically
could,
but
take
the
situation
where
a
juvenile
is
told
by
his
judge.
now
you
finger
somebody
else
who
was
witty
there
and
testify
about
that
or
else
i
am
going
to
send
your
way
as
long
as
i
can,
you
had
a
situation
like
that
and
you
forbid
any
questioning
about
his
juvenile
appearance,
you
know,
before
that
court,
i
can
see
that
confrontation
would
be
denied.
here
he
had
a
definite
motive,
and
assuming
the
testimony
is
crucial
and
assuming
it's
not
greatly
corroborated
to
show
that
there
would
not
have
been
any
doubts
raised
by
having
cross-examination.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
well,
i
read
the
opinion
as
hedging
on
the
matter,
yes,
i
think,
it
did
and
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
no,
but
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
well,
we
do
have
the
other
rule
that
i
mentioned
about
how
the
interest
of
justice
can
call
the
rule
not
to
be
applied,
but
the
alaska
supreme
court,
when
it
discussed
this
issue,
a
rather
brief
discussion,
but
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
and
in
footnote
40
on
59a,
they
start
out
with
a
case
where
they
say
it
stands
for
this
juvenile
record
not
admissible
to
impeach
absence
special
circumstances.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
in
citing
a
case
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
i
would
think
they
would
be
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
i
think
these
cases
would
be
very
rare
and
they
will
not
be
a
great
breach
in
the
juvenile
secrecy
structure
as
such
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
the
case,
for
example,
where
the
judge
tells
them
you
get
on
the
stand
or
you
will
be
sentenced
more
than
you
would
be
ordinarily
or
a
case
like
where
there
has
been
perjury,
that
has
come
out
on
the
stand
and
you've
got
to
bring
up
the
juvenile
record
to
show
it,
in
cases
like
that.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
i
think
that's
all
i
have,
there
is
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
it
should
have
suggested
that
to
mr.
wagstaff,
whether
it
turned
out
like
that.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
he
should
have
at
least
done
that,
and
i
think
the
judge
had
a
duty
to
do
it
on
his
own
and
as
i
argue
in
that
footnote,
this
was
really
not
an
untruthful
reply.
he
had
never
been
questioned
like
that
as
far
as
we
know,
he
had
never
been
questioned
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
it
was
ambiguous.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
i
don’t
see
why
this
court
should
focus
upon
that
one
questions
and
say,
look
here
was
all
this
perjury
when
it
has
not
even
been
raised
in
the
brief,
has
not
been
raised
until
argument
now
and
the
lower
court
has
had
no
chance
at
all
to
rule
upon
that
particular
error,
if
that
was
error
at
that
one
point.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
as
fas
as
i
know,
yes.
he
could
have
argued
that
this
was
a
non-responsive
answer
and
i
am
not
bound,
he
could
have
made
that
argument
and
the
judge
certainly
within
his
discussion
could
have
stricken
that.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
well,
okay.
[laughter]
certainly,
he
was
responsive
to
the
--
thank
you.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
read
this
court's
confrontation
cases
in
determining
the
damage
that
has
been
done
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process,
i
see
that
the
focus
is
on
two
things.
one
is
the
cruciality
of
the
un-confronted
testimony
and
the
other
is
that
this
court
likes
to
see
just
how
mislead
the
fact-finder
has
been
by
not
hearing
the
confrontation
that
has
been
denied.
and
i
must
concede
that
richard
green's
testimony
was
crucial
to
the
state's
case
against
joshua
davis.
my
argument
is
that
the
jury
was
not
significantly
mislead
by
the
denial
of
cross-examination,
by
not
having
heard
about
the
juvenile
record
and
by
not
hearing
cross-examination
in
this
area.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
no,
your
honor.
my
argument
is
that
the
testimony
was
reliable
enough
that
the
jurors
were
authorized
to
hear
it,
even
though
they
did
not
hear
these
facts
that
impeached
the
testimony
and
they
did
not
hear
cross-examination
in
that
area.
in
determining
just
how
mislead
the
jurors
were,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
here
at
the
outset
that
richard
green
was
on
the
stand,
he
was
immediately
cross-examined,
in
all
areas
except
this
one.
he
was
under
oath.
the
jury
was
able
to
observe
this
man's
demeanor
as
he
testified
and
although
mr.
wagstaff
could
not
cross-examine
him
in
this
one
area,
he
was
able
to
bring
out
questions
concerning
whether
or
not
this
person
thought
himself
to
be
under
suspicion
and
therefore,
whether
or
not
he
had
a
motive
to
quickly
identify
somebody
else
or
to
fabricate
his
story
in
order
to
help
himself
in
some
way.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
i
would
dispute
that
your
honor
and
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
mr.
chief
justice
i
pointed
out
in
footnote
3
on
my
brief,
it's
on
page
13
that
this
response
was
not
untruthful
because
this
inquiry
referred
to
being
questioned
as
a
prospective
witness
and
not
as
a
prospective
accused.
the
words
were,
have
you
ever
been
questioned
like
that
before?
this
man
was
a
witness
and
he
was
not
a
prospective
accused.
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
police
officers
questioned
him
at
all
when
he
was
picked
up
for
his
juvenile
violation.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
when
this
question
was
answered
in
this
way,
if
mr.
wagstaff
had
thought
here
that
there
was
perjury
involved,
he
could
have
asked
for
the
jury
to
be
excused,
could
have
gone
into
this
further,
but
there
was
an
objection
of
mr.
ripley,
the
prosecuting
attorney
said,
i
am
going
to
object
to
this,
your
honor.
it's
a
carry
on
with
rehash
of
the
same
thing.
he
is
attempting
to
the
raise
in
the
jury's
mind.
court
simply
said,
i
will
sustain
the
objection.
mr.
wagstaff
at
that
time
could
have
made
an
offer
of
proof,
an
offer
of
proof
that
perjury
had
been
committed.
and
if
he
could
have
shown
that,
then
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
have
had
to
have
allowed
in
this
juvenile
record,
because
if
you
have
got
perjury
on
the
stand,
certainly,
the
defense
counsel
should
be
able
to
impeach
with
whatever
means
is
necessary
to
bring
out
the
fact
that
there
has
been
perjury
on
the
stand.
as
the
record
now
stands
and
he
has
never
raised
this.
in
his
brief
he
simply
says
in
this
one
statement,
counsel
asked
if
he
had
ever
been
questioned
before
by
law
enforcement
officers?
his
answer
was,
no.
and
he
doesn't
say
in
there,
just
show
that
the
man
purged
himself,
the
implications
raised,
of
course,
and
that's
the
reason
i
have
put
in
my
footnote
3,
but
as
to
final
draw
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
oh,
yes,
but
of
course,
a
rule
cannot
stand
if
it's
unconstitutional
for
its
application,
to
be
--
for
it
to
be
applied
and
there
is
another
rule
in
the
alaska
criminal
rules,
rule
57
which
says
that
in
the
interest
of
justice,
we
can't
dispense
with
any
of
the
foregoing
rules.
the
rule
would
i
submit
have
had
to
have
been
abandoned
at
that
point,
if
during
the
offer
of
proof,
it
had
come
out
that
richard
green
had
perjured
himself
by
the
statement,
then
i
would
think
that
defense
counsel
would
have
been
able
to
bring
out
the
juvenile
record
at
that
point
or
his
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him
would
be
denied.
but
mr.
wagstaff
in
getting
off
this
point,
was
able
to
question
closely
about
whether
or
not
richard
green
considered
himself
under
suspicion.
and
as
the
alaska
supreme
court
stressed,
the
jury
was
able
to
observe
his
demeanor
while
he
was
being
questioned
this
way.
the
facts
that
work
out
from
the
jurors
did
somewhat
impeach
richard
green's
testimony
the
fact
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
did
somewhat
impugn
his
credibility
that's
being
a
larcenous
type
crime,
a
burglary
of
two
cabins.
the
fact
that
he
was
on
probation
showed
that
he
had
somewhat
of
a
motive
to
quickly
identify
somebody
else
to
hoist
the
blame
onto
someone
else
to
take
the
suspicion
that
he
felt
was
on
himself
or
perhaps
even
to
fabricate
his
story
in
order
to
aid
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
enforcement
people
he
had
to
deal
with.
but,
these
facts
are
not
that
impeaching
in
themselves.
as
for
the
argument
that
the
conviction
it
show
--
itself
impeaches
his
credibility
in
the
sense
that
this
was
a
larcenous
type
crime.
mr.
wagstaff
is
not
relying
much
upon
this
argument.
as
mr.
justice
white
was
bringing
out,
the
alaska
supreme
court,
indicated
in
the
opinion
that
this
was
not
mr.
wagstaff's
main
argument
that
it
should
have
been
brought
in
as
a
conviction
itself
to
impeach
credibility.
he
has
a
further
argument,
that
is,
that
there
was
a
motive
here
because
of
the
probation.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
mentioned
the
possibility
of
totally
abolishing
for
any
witness,
the
use
of
prior
records.
now
in
february
this
year,
alaska
--
the
alaska
supreme
court
did
promulgate
a
rule,
that
says
you
cannot
use
for
any
witness,
any
criminal
conviction
if
it
is
over
five
years
old.
i
can
see
problems
there.
if
there
is
a
perjury
conviction
and
that's
six
years
old
in
the
state's
witness
as
the
perjury
conviction
behind
him,
is
a
crucial
witness.
i
can
definitely
see
there
are
problems
that
the
defense
counsel
would
be
denied
his
right
to
confront,
if
he
could
not
answer
a
question.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
if
by
not
being
allowed
to
go
into
this
area,
the
jury
is
rather
greatly
misled
about
the
reliability
of
his
testimony,
that
testimony
is
crucial,
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
well,
i
know
in
washington
v.
texas,
this
court
stressed
the
fact
that
they
were
no
way
indicating
that
these
privileges
were
being
questioned.
but
i
could
see
the
possibility
of
the
defense
knowing
about
some
communication
made
to
a
husband,
wife
is
on
the
stand,
crucial
state's
witness.
some
communication
that
you
know,
she
tells
him,
i
am
going
to
get
up
on
the
stand
and
lie
and
i
can
see
there
that
if
the
state
just
went
ahead
and
applied
the
rule
without
any
much
consideration
about,
i
can
see
that
the
denial
of
confrontation
wouldn't
exist
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
no,
mr.
justice--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
i
am
arguing
here
that
the
focus
should
be
--
the
test
should
on
the
cruciality
of
the
testimony
to
just
how
misled
were
the
jurors.
now,
this
test
will
apply
to
any
fact
situation
or
apply
to
any
privilege
his
equity
of
privilege
whatever
and
it
maybe
that
all
rules
in
some
situations
would
have
to
fall.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
assuming
the
court
does
not
on
its
own
do
so.
now,
as
to
the
impeaching
quality
of
the
fact
that
richard
green
was
on
probation.
the
record
contains
no
indication
that
he
stood
to
gain
anything
significant
at
all
by
his
actions.
the
record
contains
no
indication
that
he
in
anyway
was
involved
in
that
burglary
that
he
stood
to
separate
probation
obligation.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
in
light
of
how
impeaching
these
facts
were
generally,
which
i
have
submit
are
not
that
impeaching
and
in
light
of
the
extensive
corroboration
of
this
man's
testimony,
it
seems
apparent
that
any
further
cross-examination
into
this
area
would
not
have
raised
any
hidden
doubts
in
the
jurors'
minds,
doubts
that
are
not
present
in
this
record.
this
extensive
corroboration
shows
that
his
testimony
would
not
have
cracked
under
further
examination.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
let
me
go
into
just
how
corroborative
this
testimony
was
and
i
think
that
when
you
realize
just
how
corroborated
it
was,
then
you
will
see
that
by
asking
these
further
questions,
that
testimony
would
not
have
been
changed.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
in
these
confrontation
cases,
that's
the
question
that
has
to
be
asked,
just
what
would
the
jurors
have
thought.
the
test
is
what
the
average
juror
would
have
thought,
an
average
(inaudible)
brings
up,
but
that
is
the
question
has
to
be
asked.
now
the
confrontation
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
it's
even
colder
than
this
up
then.[laughter]
but,
if
we
look
at
just
how
corroborated
his
testimony
was,
we'll
see
that
these
hidden
doubts
would
not
have
been
raised
by
further
examination,
any
significant
hidden
doubt.
now,
perhaps
most
importantly,
there
was
a
story
given
to
the
trooper
on
the
very
day
that
the
burglary
occurred
on
the
very
day
that
the
safe
was
found
out
at
his
stepfather's
property.
and
he
said
i
saw
these
two
men
beside
a
late
model,
metallic
blue,
chevrolet
sedan.
the
very
next
day
he
went
down
to
police
station.
he
picked
out,
out
of
six
pictures,
and
i
believe
the
record
will
show
that,
i
know
will
show
that
the
alaska
supreme
court
opinion
is
wrong
in
that
respect,
there
were
six
pictures.
they
are
identified
in
the
record,
exhibits
25-30
i
believe.
he
picked
out
and
also
the
alaska
supreme
court
opinion
is
wrong
when
it
says,
he
picked
two
pictures,
he
picked
out
one
picture,
the
record
will
show.
so
he
picked
out
of
six
pictures,
the
picture
of
the
petitioner.
he
was
able
to
do
this
even
though
it
was
ten
years
old.
he
did
not
show
the
petitioner
with
a
mustache
in
the
picture.
although
at
the
scene
of
the
burglary
he
had
a
mustache
at
the
lineup,
two
days
after
the
photo
lineup
he
had
a
mustache
and
two
days
after
the
photo
identification
there
was
a
capoeira
lineup.
he
again
picked
the
man
out,
out
of
a
group
of
seven
men.
he
picked
two
men
at
that
time,
one
as
representing
the
other
man.
so
he
picked
joshua
davis,
and
as
it
turned
out
the
evidence
was
that
joshua
davis
had
rented
a
late
model
of
1969,
burglary
having
occurred
in
february
of
1970,
metallic
blue,
chevrolet
impala.
at
this
point,
maybe
i
should
mention
that
mr.
wagstaff
contends
that
there
was
a
coercive
atmosphere
there.
yet,
there
really
is
nothing
in
record,
that
shows
there
wasn't
anything
suggestive
about
the
photo
identification,
nothing
at
all.
he
was
in
a
room
down
at
the
police
station
true,
but
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
no
indication
was
made
during
the
pick
out
of
such
and
such
a
picture.
his
testimony
to
that
affect
is
none
to
the
contrary.
nothing
at
all
on
the
record
showing
that
the
photo
identification
was
suggestive.
there
is
lots
of
evidence
about
how
this
lineup
was
conducted,
again
nothing,
the
capoeira
(ph)
lineup,
nothing
indicated,
that
wasn't
anyway
suggested.
now,
not
only
did
he
rent
the
car
that
was
described,
but
the
police
developed
evidence
or
discovered
evidence
that
on
the
day
of
the
burglary,
shortly
afternoon,
joshua
davis
extended
the
rental
contract
by
paying
from
a
large
roll
of
bills,
$50,
and
two
rolls
of
quarter.
and
the
story
that
richard
green
had
given
was
that
he
had
seen
these
men
out
there
shortly
before
noon.
also,
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
there
were
paint
chips
and
fibers,
found
that,
i
submit,
virtually
conclusively
show
that
that
safe
was
in
that
trunk.
now
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
when
you
look
at
the
harmless
error
argument,
you
look
at
whether
or
not
the
jury
would
have
been
swayed
to
vote
differently,
if
it
had
heard
this
evidence.
now
i
have
just
given
you
some
evidence
that
the
jury
hasn't
even
heard,
that
is,
the
contract
extension.
jury
never
heard
about
that.
i
submit
that
the
test
is
whether
or
not
this
evidence
was
reliable,
viewing
all
that
we
know
about
this
testimony,
you
know,
all
we
know,
was
it
reliable
enough
so
that
this
jury
was
given
reliable
testimony
was
not
misled
as
to
this
testimony,
so
that
an
innocent
man
was
not
convicted.
it
is
not
an
harmless
error
argument
as
such
and
that
you
do
look
at
other
evidences,
aside
from
what
the
record
contains,
not
that
the
jury
heard.
mr.
wagstaff
says
that
all
that
the
paint
chips
and
fibers
showed
was
that,
a
safe
could
have
been
in
the
safe.
the
fbi
agent
told
about
performing
a
microchemical
analysis
on
the
fibers
and
he
said
that
he
had
never
found
this
particular
composition
materials
in
the
fibers
anywhere
within
safes.
he
compared
the
fibers
from
the
safe
with
the
fibers
in
the
trunk,
he
said
they
matched.
he
said
that
just
by
looking
at
the
fibers
in
the
trunk,
he
could
almost
conclude
for
sure
that
they
came
from
a
mosler
safe,
this
was
a
mosler
safe,
and
you
have
the
paint.
there
were
three
layers
of
paint.
again
a
microchemical
analysis
on
each
layer
was
the
same.
the
evidence
virtually
shows
beyond
any
doubt
that
that
trunk
did
contain
that
safe
at
one
time.
also,
richard
green,
when
he
first
told
the
story
to
the
trooper,
said
that
the
man
he
talked
with,
whom
he
later
identified
as
joshua
davis,
who
was
wearing
a
brown
or
black
mackinaw
jacket.
when
the
safe
was
later
examined,
there
was
found
to
be
of
little
reddish
brown
material
on
one
of
the
rough
edges
where
it
had
been
broken
into.
joshua
davis's
description
is
given
by
richard
green
did
not
vary
from
his
actual
description
and
as
to
the
tires
in
the
reply
brief,
mr.
wagstaff
said
that
i
unduly
relied
upon
the
evidence
concerning
the
tires.
there
were
two
sets
of
tire
tracks
out
there,
and
one
set
of
tire
tracks
went
up
to
where
the
safe
was
found.
there
had
been
a
snow
two
or
three
days
earlier.
these
were
the
only
tire
tracks
there.
the
officer
investigator
gray
testified
that
he
examined
the
two
sets
of
tire
tracks,
both
appeared
to
be
made
by
snow
tires.
the
two
tracks
had
been
made
by
different
vehicles
and
then
when
he
was
asked
by
mr.
wagstaff,
at
questioning,
he
said
the
snow
tires
on
the
rear
of
the
vehicle
appeared
to
be
the
same
and
he
met
there
and
it
was
clear
from
the
questioning,
appear
to
be
the
same
on
these
tracks
that
led
up
to
the
place
where
the
safe
was
dumped
off,
as
the
tires
on
the
back
of
the
vehicle.
so
you
have
all
this
corroboration.
the
other
fact
that
he
was
on
the
stand
and
the
jury
was
able
to
observe
his
demeanor,
he
was
under
oath
to
the
extent
that
he
was
cross-examined
and
his
testimony
contained
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability
to
justify
the
jury
having
heard
this
testimony
even
without
the
denied
cross-examination.
the
jury
still
possessed
a
satisfactory
basis
for
examining
the
truthfulness
of
this
testimony
and
joshua
davis
was
not
denied
a
fair
trial.
in
the
confrontation
cases
of
this
court,
the
thing
is
look
not
only
to
the
damage
done
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process,
but
the
cases
look
to
the
underlying
reasons
behind
the
denial
of
the
confrontation.
and
if
there
has
been
a
significant
misleading
of
the
jury
concerning
crucial
testimony,
that
reason
has
to
be
closely
examined.
in
this
case
the
jury
was
not
significantly
misled
concerning
the
crucial
testimony,
but
even
if
we
close
examine
the
--
closely
examine
the
reason
behind
denying
the
cross-examination
in
the
area,
the
juvenile
record
here,
it
will
bear
up
to
the
the
scrutiny.
if
juvenile
records
had
to
be
revealed
in
cases
that
would
not
benefit
in
which
it
would
not
benefit
the
defense,
anymore
than
it
would
have
in
this
case,
then
many
juvenile
records
will
have
to
be
revealed.
and,
of
course,
that
will
open
somewhat
of
the
breach
and
the
juvenile
system
structure
and
there
will
be
an
attempted
to
damage
to
the
system
as
such
and
it
will
adversely
affect
many
juvenile
witnesses
who
have
juvenile
--
many
witnesses
who
have
juvenile
records
and
it
will
especially
affect
us,
you
are
still
being
rehabilitated
at
the
time
they
have
to
take
the
stand
such
as
was
the
case
here
with
richard
green.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
i
would
like
to
argue
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
i
would
argue
for
a
per
se
rule
if
i
felt
that
i
analytically
could,
but
take
the
situation
where
a
juvenile
is
told
by
his
judge.
now
you
finger
somebody
else
who
was
witty
there
and
testify
about
that
or
else
i
am
going
to
send
your
way
as
long
as
i
can,
you
had
a
situation
like
that
and
you
forbid
any
questioning
about
his
juvenile
appearance,
you
know,
before
that
court,
i
can
see
that
confrontation
would
be
denied.
here
he
had
a
definite
motive,
and
assuming
the
testimony
is
crucial
and
assuming
it's
not
greatly
corroborated
to
show
that
there
would
not
have
been
any
doubts
raised
by
having
cross-examination.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
well,
i
read
the
opinion
as
hedging
on
the
matter,
yes,
i
think,
it
did
and
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
no,
but
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
well,
we
do
have
the
other
rule
that
i
mentioned
about
how
the
interest
of
justice
can
call
the
rule
not
to
be
applied,
but
the
alaska
supreme
court,
when
it
discussed
this
issue,
a
rather
brief
discussion,
but
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
and
in
footnote
40
on
59a,
they
start
out
with
a
case
where
they
say
it
stands
for
this
juvenile
record
not
admissible
to
impeach
absence
special
circumstances.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
in
citing
a
case
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
i
would
think
they
would
be
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
but
i
think
these
cases
would
be
very
rare
and
they
will
not
be
a
great
breach
in
the
juvenile
secrecy
structure
as
such
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
the
case,
for
example,
where
the
judge
tells
them
you
get
on
the
stand
or
you
will
be
sentenced
more
than
you
would
be
ordinarily
or
a
case
like
where
there
has
been
perjury,
that
has
come
out
on
the
stand
and
you've
got
to
bring
up
the
juvenile
record
to
show
it,
in
cases
like
that.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
i
think
that's
all
i
have,
there
is
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
it
should
have
suggested
that
to
mr.
wagstaff,
whether
it
turned
out
like
that.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
he
should
have
at
least
done
that,
and
i
think
the
judge
had
a
duty
to
do
it
on
his
own
and
as
i
argue
in
that
footnote,
this
was
really
not
an
untruthful
reply.
he
had
never
been
questioned
like
that
as
far
as
we
know,
he
had
never
been
questioned
--
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
it
was
ambiguous.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
yes,
i
don’t
see
why
this
court
should
focus
upon
that
one
questions
and
say,
look
here
was
all
this
perjury
when
it
has
not
even
been
raised
in
the
brief,
has
not
been
raised
until
argument
now
and
the
lower
court
has
had
no
chance
at
all
to
rule
upon
that
particular
error,
if
that
was
error
at
that
one
point.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
as
fas
as
i
know,
yes.
he
could
have
argued
that
this
was
a
non-responsive
answer
and
i
am
not
bound,
he
could
have
made
that
argument
and
the
judge
certainly
within
his
discussion
could
have
stricken
that.
mr.
charles
m.
merriner
well,
okay.
[laughter]
certainly,
he
was
responsive
to
the
--
thank
you.
