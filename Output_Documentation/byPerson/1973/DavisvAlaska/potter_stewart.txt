justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
chief
justice
boney
and
that
part
appearing
on
59a
of
the
appendix,
he
was
simply
describing
your
argument.
he
says
that
you
recognize
that
the
majority
of
the
case
law
is
against
you,
so
far
as
cross-examining
a
juvenile
prosecution
witness
goes,
in
order
generally
to
impeach
him
and
that
therefore
you
are
trying
to
take
your
case
out
of
this
general
rule
and
show
that
you
have
very
special
reasons,
special
circumstances
to
do
it
here
and
particularly
in
the
light
of
his
footnote
point
on
that
page.
now
you
know
what
you
argued
to
the
alaska
supreme
court,
i
don't,
but
this
seems
to
be
a
reflection
of
the
argument
you
made,
that
you
are
not
under
the
general
rule,
you
are
under
the
exception
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
special
circumstances
in
your
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
this
particular
witness
having
been
found
delinquent
by
reason
of
larceny
and
of
this
stolen
safe
having
been
found
next
to
his
trunk
and
therefore
that
he
was
under
some
particular
reason
to
testify
against
your
client,
that
that
wasn't
just
a
case
of
general
impeachment,
that's
what
i
understand,
is
that
my
--
justice
potter
stewart
one
has
read
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
went
on
to
think
that
if
that
was
your
purpose,
at
least
their
view
of
the
evidence
was
and
at
the
cross-examination
that
you
had
ample
opportunity
to
satisfy
that
purpose,
within
the
cross-examination
that
you
were
allowed?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
they
say?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
merriner,
you
began
this,
your
statement
by
saying
up
juvenile
records
have
to
be
revealed
in
a
case
that
would
not
be
of
greater
benefit
to
the
defense
than
in
this
particular
case.
are
you
suggesting
then
that
the
rule
should
not
be
that
the
juvenile
record
is
always
inadmissible
on
cross-examination
of
prosecuting
witness
for
purposes
of
impeachment,
but
that
there
be
a
case-by-case
rule
and
balancing
of
how
much
harm
is
done
to
the
defendant
by
nondisclosure
of
the
record,
how
much,
how
--
how
much
damage
would
be
done
to
the
particular
juvenile
by
disclosure
of
the
record
and
so
on,
or
are
you
trying
--
is
that
the
rule
that
do
you
think
the
court
--?
justice
potter
stewart
--
put
to
test
of
this
constitutional
area
or
are
you
on
the
other
hand
saying
that
there
ought
to
be
a
per
se
rule
that
if
a
state
has
expressed
a
public
policy
as
your
state
of
alaska
has,
that
juvenile
records
not
be
revealed
that
that
be
the
end
of
it,
that
they
never
be
revealed
on
cross-examination?
is
that
what
you
are
telling
us
that
it
ought
to
be
or
are
you
as
your
statement
just
suggested
--
suggesting
that
there
would
a
case-by-case
evaluation
and
a
balancing
in
each
case
depending
upon
the
specific
circumstances
of
each
case?
justice
potter
stewart
on
page
60a,
that's
at
bottom
of
page,
they
seem
to
be
hedging
a
little
bit
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
great
damage
was
done.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
citing
if
would
the
california
case
how?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
and
to
come
back
to
my
question,
what's
your
argument
is
to
us
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it
then
from
your
answer
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
that
you
concede
that
there
maybe
cases
where
a
denial
of
the
right
of
the
defense
counsel
to
ask
a
prosecutor
witness
about
his
juvenile
record
would
be
a
deprivation
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
about
that
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
these
cases
would
be
rare
and
this
is
not
one
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wagstaff,
are
you
contending
for
a
rule
that
would
prevent
defense
counsel
to
cross-examine
a
juvenile
prosecuting
witness
as
to
his
previous
record
in
all
cases,
even
though
the
state
had
a
policy
such
as
your
state
of
alaska
has,
keeping
such
records
confidential
or
are
you
simply
telling
us
that
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
important
to
protect
all
the
rights
of
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
supreme
court
of
alaska,
you
argued
that
your
case
was
different,
you
said
as
i
understand
that,
as
the
general
rule
is
you
can’t
bring
it
up
but
this
case
is
special
circumstance.
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
bring
that
argument
to
us,
are
you
arguing
that
the
general
rule
seems
to
be
conceded
in
the
states
is
simply
constitutionally
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact,
your
objections
are
that
if
we
set
at
this
particular
question,
i
got
it
from
the
brief,
i
haven’t
gone
beyond
them,
that
only
michigan
has
adopted
--

potter
stewart

me?
