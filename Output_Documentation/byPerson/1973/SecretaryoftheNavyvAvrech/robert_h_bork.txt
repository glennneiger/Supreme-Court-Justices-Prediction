mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
turns
on
the
constitutionality
of
article
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
that
article
punishes
among
other
things,
all
disorders
and
neglects
of
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
in
the
armed
forces.
in
all
conduct
of
a
nature
to
bring
this
credit
upon
the
armed
forces.
the
article
entered
our
military
jurisprudence
that
was
enacted
by
the
congress
in
1775
and
has
been
reenacted
repeatedly
since
then
by
congress.
the
first
reenactment
occurring
in
1806,
apparently
the
man
who
wrote
the
constitution
had
no
doubt
of
its
compatibility
with
this
article.
it’s
been
in
effect
as
an
organic
part
of
our
military
law
now
for
just
under
200
years
and
in
our
history
millions
and
tons
of
millions
of
service
man
and
woman
have
served
under
this
article.
it
is
a
settled
--
a
piece
of
our
jurisprudence,
i
suppose
as
there
is
at
stake,
in
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
article,
of
course
are
several
fundamental
values
of
our
society.
appellee
here
urges
the
values
of
fair
warning
in
due
process
and
free
speech.
i
will
attempt
to
show
that
article
134
is
fully
compatible
with
those
values
and
does
not
threaten.
but
must
also
be
recognized,
however,
is
that
the
judicial
destruction
of
article
134
would
jeopardize
two
other
important
values
in
our
society.
the
first
of
course
is
the
effect
of
those
american
armed
forces
upon
which
the
safety
of
the
nation
rests.
the
second,
however,
is
a
value
which
i
think
is
not
sufficiently
recognized.
and
that
is
the
importance
of
article
134
in
confining
the
role
of
the
military
in
our
national
political
processes
and
decisions.
should
speech
of
the
sort
involved
in
this
case
and
in
captain
levy’s
case
which
we
argue
next,
come
to
be
permitted
in
the
military?
there
would
be
real
danger
that
our
military
would
become
so
unreliable
as
to
frustrate
civilian
policy
to
be
unable
to
carry
out
civilian
policy.
but
worst
than
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
danger
of
a
politicized
military
establishment
with
all
the
dangers
that
prospect
poses
for
the
principle
of
civilian
control
of
the
military.
this
speech
in
these
cases
in
opposition
to
warnings
and
if
its
permissible
for
a
pfc
and
a
captain
to
make
these
publications
or
attempt
these
publications
and
make
these
speeches
under
these
circumstances,
then
i
do
not
see
why
it
will
not
be
permissible
equally
for
general
officers
and
admirals
to
address
their
troops
about
their
political
views
and
about
their
disagreement
with
the
president
of
united
states
and
about
their
disagreement
with
warnings.
we
are
not
dealing
with
small
issues
in
this
case.
the
appellee
mark
avrech
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
expunge
his
court-martial
conviction
which
was
under
article
80
which
punishes
attempts,
and
the
attempt
was
to
violate
article
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
the
district
court
dismissed
his
suit
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
article
134
as
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
conduct
underlying
this
court-martial
conviction
occurred
at
the
marble
mountain
air
facility
in
da
nang
in
vietnam
where
pfc
avrech
was
on
active
of
duty
with
the
marine
corps
in
a
combat
zone.
while
on
night
duty,
in
the
group
supply
officers
at
his
base,
avrech
typed
of
a
stencil
of
a
statement
entitled
“the
truth”
and
marked
volume
1,
number
1.
this
statement
is
set
out
in
full
at
pages
4
and
5
of
the
government’s
brief.
and
he
intended
to
circulate
it.
he
said
only
to
eight
or
10
of
his
friends
in
the
marine
corps.
the
statement
is
the
denunciation
of
the
united
states
military
rule
in
vietnam
and
it
contained
such
sentences
as
these.
“why
should
we
go
out
and
fight
there
in
the
south
vietnamese?
why
should
we
go
out
and
fight
with
their
battles
while
they
sit
home
and
complain
about
communist
aggression?
what
are
we
cannon
fodder
or
human
beings?”
going
on,
“the
united
states
has
no
business
over
here.
are
your
opinions
worth
risking
a
court-martial?
we
must
strive
for
peace
and
if
not
peace
then
a
complete
u.s.
withdrawal.
we
have
been
sitting
ducks
for
too
long.”
the
statement
is
more
extensive
than
that
and
that
is
in
tone
and
in
substance
a
denunciation
as
i
say
in
united
states
warnings.
i
think
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
had
pfc
avrech
succeeded
in
publishing
that
statement,
the
document
would
tend
to
create
disaffection
among
the
troops
and
it
would
certainly
create
lowered
morale
among
troops
in
a
combat
zone.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
certainly
would
stimulate
debate.
i
think
that
is
certainly
fair
mr.
chief
justice.
in
addition
to
that
apparently
although
he
was
not
charged
but
the
record
in
the
case
the
summary
of
the
record
in
the
case,
the
original
record
of
transcript
has
been
destroyed,
indicates
that
pfc
avrech
constantly
stimulated
debate
about
--
among
his
fellows,
about
the
wrongness
of
the
united
states
warnings.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
were
discussing
at
the
lunch
break
the
facts
of
this
case
having
typed
out
on
a
stencil
his
denunciation
of
the
warnings
in
united
states
for
circulation
to
the
troops
and
it
was
entitled
volume
1
part
1
because
pfc
avrech
testified
that
he
had
intended
to
publish
other
such
statements
as
his
thinking
developed
along
this
lines.
having
typed
up
this
first
statement,
avrech
attempted
to
gain
access
to
the
supply
office
mimeograph
machine
in
order
to
run
the
statement
off.
and
in
the
process
he
showed
in
to
a
corporal
who
controlled
the
machine,
the
corporal
took
the
statement
and
gave
it
to
a
superior
and
as
a
result,
avrech
was
tried
before
a
special
court-martial
on
charges
of
violating
articles
134
and
80.
the
court
martial
acquitted
him
on
the
article
134
charge
but
convicted
him
under
article
80
which
as
i
say
punishes
attempts
to
commit
offenses.
and
here
the
specification,
the
charge
under
article
80
charged
an
attempt
to
commit
an
offense
under
article
134
namely
an
attempt
to
publish
to
members
of
the
armed
forces
with
design
to
promote
disloyalty
and
disaffection
among
the
troops,
the
statement
disloyal
to
united
states.
this
charge
required
a
finding
of
specific
intent
and
was
modeled
on
a
standard
form,
contained
in
the
manual
for
court-martial.
upon
conviction,
avrech
was
reduced
in
rank
from
private
first
class
to
private,
sentenced
to
forfeiture
of
three
months’
pay,
and
sentenced
to
one
month
hard
labor
and
confinement.
the
commanding
officer
suspended
the
confinement
in
all
of
the
respects
to
the
regular
review
process
the
conviction
and
the
sentence
were
affirmed.
so
that
he
received
a
rather
mild
sentence
but
did
not
put
any
bad
conduct
discharge
in
his
record
and
did
not
confine
him
in
any
way.
the
appellee
challenged
this
conviction
under
one
fifth
amendment
doctrine
void
for
vagueness
and
two
aspects
of
first
amendment
doctrine
overbreadth
and
the
claim
that
the
statement
he
attempted
to
issue
was
protected
speech.
i
think
none
of
these
contentions
can
withstand
examination.
i
would
like
to
examine
the
vagueness
point
first.
i
think
it’s
essential
to
realize
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
parallel
statute
applied
to
the
civilian
population
would
be
unconstitutionally
vague.
nobody
would
know
in
a
free
and
permissive
society
what
was
conceivably
meant
by
something
like
disorders
and
neglects
to
the
prejudice
of
social
order.
the
difference
of
course
is
that
a
civilian
society
is
basically
a
free
society;
it
is
not
and
furthermore
it
has
no
single
mission
unlike
the
military.
the
military
society
is
an
ordered
society,
it
has
a
mission,
it
has
a
structure.
and
for
that
reason,
one
knows
what
tends
to
detract
from
that
mission,
what
tends
to
break
down
discipline
and
good
order.
now
counsel
for
the
appellee
argued
this
case
as
if
it
did
involve
a
statute
applied
to
the
civilian
population.
and
they
refused
i
think
to
face
the
only
issue,
the
real
issue
which
is
the
military
context
in
which
this
article
exists.
indeed
in
which
this
article
has
been
--
which
this
article
has
been
an
organic
part
for
200
years.
and
that
is
what
makes
all
the
difference
in
this
case.
that
context
and
the
limiting
constructions
given
by
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
give
article
134
the
definiteness
it
requires.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
military
context
did
not
give
it
sufficient
definiteness
mr.
justice
douglas
but
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
that
it
does.
one,
it
seems
to
me
extremely
telling
point
in
this
case
is
that
counsel
for
the
appellee
argued
this
case
by
a
series
of
hypothetic.
although
this
article
has
been
used
for
200
years,
they
do
not
cite
a
single
case
of
injustice
done
by
the
military
under
this
article.
they
do
not
cite
a
single
case
in
which
a
convicted
serviceman
could
not
--
in
which
a
convicted
serviceman
could
have
entertained
any
doubt
that
what
he
did
was
prejudicial
to
good
order
and
discipline
and
that
what
he
did
was
wrong
and
illegal
so
far
as
a
military
society
was
concerned.
whatever
superficial
plausibility
appellee's
challenge
has
is
gained
only
by
ignoring
the
meaning
given
by
military
function
in
context
by
ignoring
the
actual
operation
of
the
military
system
and
arguing
instead
from
wholly
imaginary
cases.
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
repeatedly
said
at
this
article
that
it
reaches
only
misconduct
and
disorders
which
are
directly
and
probably
prejudicial
to
good
order
and
discipline
so
that
the
construction
placed
upon
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
followed
by
the
courts-martial
is
that
the
tendency
to
injure
good
order
and
discipline
must
be
direct
and
it
must
be
obvious
or
reasonable
manner.
in
addition
to
that
of
course,
the
manual
for
courts-martial
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
discuses
at
page
7
(a)
this
article
and
the
specific
charge
of
disloyal
speech.
now,
knowledge
of
what
conduct
directly
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that’s
quite
true.
the
average
enlisted
man
is
not
although
more
enlisted
men
than
one
might
think
are.
particularly
enlisted
man
who
recognize
themselves
as
coming
into
--
brush
possibly
with
this
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know
that.
i
do
know
though
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
articles
of
war
--
the
articles
of
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
don’t
need
it
but
i
think
i
would
like
to
use
it
if
i
may.[laughter
attempt]
the
articles
are
explained
to
the
troops
as
part
of
their
basic
training.
the
manual
is
available
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
manual
is
really
as
available
to
an
enlisted
man
in
the
marine
corps
as
--
is
a
criminal
code
of
illinois
say
to
the
man
who
really
gets
under
pressure.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
manual
is
explained
and
the
articles
are
explained.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
but
aside
from
history
and
tradition,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
important
and
obvious
facts
about
this
case
is
that
the
military
does
comprise
a
specialized
community,
it
has
a
well
understood
and
a
specialized
function
which
is
something
a
civilian
community
does
not
have.
and
the
need
for
order
and
discipline
in
that
specialized
community
is
known
throughout
our
culture
and
it
is
obvious
to
everyone.
it
is
also
obvious
what
kinds
of
behavior
tend
to
break
that
down.
now,
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
military
use
of
this
kind
of
penal
statute
is
by
no
means
unique
in
our
law.
this
is
not
confined
to
military
law
of
any
means.
court’s
frequently
apply
standards
of
this
sort
when
they
are
given
content
by
an
understood
function
and
although
on
the
face
of
the
words
they
may
seem
vague
when
they
are
in
context
they
are
not
vague.
and
i
think
this
is
true
in
a
variety
of
areas
and
i
would
like
to
mention
a
few.
in
the
first
place
and
most
obviously
the
sherman
act
is
vague,
criminal
proscriptions
against
things
like
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
were
upheld
in
nash
against
united
states
largely
because
the
justice
holmes
said
because
of
the
antecedent
common
law
among
other
things.
the
antecedent
common
law
was
really
not
a
great
deal
of
help,
but
in
the
--
he
explained
further
in
international
harvester
against
kentucky
that
criminal
law
is
not
unconstitutional
merely
because
it
throws
upon
men
the
risk
of
rightly
estimating
a
matter
of
degree.
and
here
the
matter
of
degree
is
what
is
an
undue
restraint
of
trade.
between
the
obviously
illegal
and
the
plainly
lawful
there’s
a
gradual
approach
and
that
the
complexity
of
life
makes
it
impossible
to
draw
a
line
in
advance
without
an
artificial
simplification
that
would
be
unjust.
the
conditions
are
as
permanent
as
anything
human
and
conditions
there
of
course
were
the
conditions
of
trade
and
economics.
here
the
conditions
are
permission
and
understood
function
of
the
military.
and
the
great
body
of
precedents
on
the
civil
side
coupled
with
familiar
practice
make
it
comparatively
easy
for
common
sense
to
keep
to
what's
safe.
that
passage,
i
think
would
only
superficial
alterations
could
have
been
written
in
defense
of
article
134
and
article
134
if
i
may
say
so
is
if
anything
clear
than
the
sherman
act
was
before
that
we
received
construction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[voice
overlap]
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
may
i
speak
to
those
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
list
of
the
appendix
mr.
justice
stewart
requires
use
for
the
great
deal
of
caution.
if
you
will
look
at
those
cases
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
seem
to
have
mislaid
my
analysis
of
them,
a
number
of
them
for
example
are
cases
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
behavior
cited
there
was
not
a
violation
of
article
134.
those
are
merely
cases
when
somebody
was
charged.
and
in
addition
to
that,
for
example
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
not
mr.
justice
stewart
because
if
one
look
at
civilian
jurisprudence
and
look
at
the
number
of
cases
in
which
people
have
been
charged
of
murder
and
how
many
of
them
were
acquitted,
one
would
not
say.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
one
of
my
examples
here
is
man
slaughter
which
is
i
suppose
a
negligent
killing
under
the
circumstances
quite
vague
criminal
proscription.
but
i
wish
to
say
about
this
for
example
not
only
are
some
of
these
examples
in
the
appendix
held
not
to
be
violations
of
article
134.
in
addition,
some
of
them
are
not
described
fully
enough.
for
example,
cheating
at
bingo,
that
was
a
gentleman
who
was
calling
out
wrong
numbers
to
rig
the
game
with
serviceman
and
then
splitting
the
proceeds.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[laughter
attempt]
jumping
off
a
ship
which
sounds
a
little
bit
carefree,
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
a
man
who
made
a
large
wages
and
he
would
do
a
back
flip
off
an
aircraft
carrier
in
motion
and
cause
the
navy
to
just
send
a
story
about
the
rescue.
these
are
cases
when
you
look
at
the
four
case,
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
case
here
in
which
it
is
not
--
in
which
a
member
is
convicted,
in
which
it
is
not
clear
that
it
should
have
known
so
that
the
conduct
was
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
or
that
it
was
served
as
discrediting
in
the
eyes
of
the
civilian
population
in
which
he
was
dealing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
certainly
is
correct,
your
honor
but
any
deviation
from
ideal
conduct
is
not
charged
under
this
article.
it
has
to
be
a
serious
direct
obvious
impact
upon,
prejudicial
impact
upon
good
order
and
discipline.
anyone
who
has
lived
among
troops
knows
that
if
deviations
from
ideal
conduct
were
prosecuted,
we
would
have
nothing
to
courts-martial.
it
is
not
the
way
this
article
is
used
and
i
think
some
attention
has
to
be
given
the
way
this
article
is
used
and
the
way
it
is
controlled
by
the
court
of
military
appeals,
and
indeed
by
the
reviewing
legal
steps
that
go
over
everyone
of
this
convictions.
but
i
have
mentioned
the
vagueness
of
the
sherman
act
which
was
saved
by
its
context
and
by
our
knowledge
of
economics,
the
criminal
offense
of
man
slaughter,
we
rely
upon
the
common
understanding
of
man
as
to
what
is
dangerously
negligent
behavior
in
a
vast
multiplicity
of
examples
that
would
be
beyond
the
skill
of
a
legislative
craftsman
to
reach.
now
if
i
turn
to
examples
involving
speech,
i
might
mention
that
courts
often
permit
indefinite
wording
if
context
gives
the
wording
meaning
and
a
parallel
example
it
seems
to
me
is
grayned
against
city
of
rockford.
and
this
court
there
upheld
a
conviction
under
anti-noise
ordinance
that
published
the
willful
making
of
noise
or
diversion
that
took
disturbs
or
tends
to
disturb
the
peace
or
good
order
of
schools.
interpreting
it
to
apply
to
actual
or
imminent
interference
with
peace
or
good
order
and
relying
upon
the
school
of
context
as
giving
meaning
to
disturbance
as
impact
on
the
normal
activities
of
the
school.
the
context
there
gave
fair
notice
and
i
think
the
context
of
the
military
gives
fair
notice
to
a
statute,
to
an
article
which
is
written
very
much
like
the
anti-noise
ordinance
was
in
grayned
against
city
of
rockford.
i
might
also
suggest
that
courts
regularly
apply
penalties
for
contempt
of
court.
that
would
seem
to
be
a
fairly
vague
standard
and
it
does
inhibit
speech
quite
directly
but
it
is
made
sufficiently
definite
by
the
common
understanding
of
the
function
of
a
courtroom.
the
function
of
the
legal
system
and
what
that
function
requires
in
the
way
of
good
order
and
discipline
by
the
part
of
attorneys
who
take
argument
in
the
courtroom.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
cite
as
very
close
to
this
case
the
clear
and
present
danger
test.
that
is
a
test
that
is
read
into
criminal
statutes
on
speech
about
over-throw
of
the
government
or
violence,
the
advocacy
of
violence.
and
hence
it
becomes
a
warning,
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
is
a
warning
that
must
be
intelligible
to
those
the
law
threatens.
and
in
dennis
against
united
states,
this
court
explained
those
words
as
follows.
it
said
that
chief
judge
learned
hand
writing
for
the
majority
below
interpreted
the
phrase
as
follows.
“in
each
case,
courts
must
ask
whether
the
gravity
of
the
evil
discounted
by
its
improbability
justify
such
invasion
of
free
speech
as
is
necessary
to
avoid
the
danger.”
then
this
court
said,
“we
adopt
this
statement
of
the
rule
as
articulated
by
chief
judge
hand,
is
as
succinct
and
inclusive
as
any
other
we
might
device
at
this
time.”
it
takes
into
consideration
those
factors
which
we
deem
relevant
and
relates
their
significances,
more
we
cannot
expect
from
words.
it
seems
to
me
that
article
134
is
certainly
no
vaguer
than
that
standard.
i
agree
that
more
we
cannot
expect
from
words,
i
think
more
we
cannot
expect
from
words
in
the
context
to
which
134
is
applied.
i
think
it
does
an
equally
good
job
of
relating
the
factors
and
their
significances.
and
there
is
one
other
parallel
i’d
like
to
draw
that
between
article
134
and
hatch
act.
this
court
was
upheld
the
hatch
act
last
term
in
the
civil
service
commission
against
national
association
of
letter
carriers.
and
at
this
point,
i’m
discussing
not
so
much
vagueness
as
overbreadth
and
the
legitimate
interest
of
government.
this
court
held
in
the
civilian
context
that
the
legitimate
interest
of
government
in
good
government
and
in
a
fair
political
process
was
enough
to
uphold
the
hatch
act’s
restrictions
upon
government
employee’s
political
activities
against
first
amendment
claims.
so
here
i
think
the
legitimate
interest
in
an
effective
military
and
in
a
military
that
does
not
dictate
civilian
policy
either
by
becoming
ineffective
so
that
it
cannot
carry
outlaws,
or
by
becoming
so
politicized
that
it
refuses
to
carry
out
the
policy
made
by
civilians,
justifies
article
134
has
very
limited
inhibitions
on
speech
just
as
the
hatch
act
was
justified
for
parallel
reasons.
in
this
case,
i
think
it’s
obvious
that
the
publication
average
would
have
published,
would
have
tended
to
spread
disaffection
among
troops
in
the
combat
zone
and
that
cannot
be
tolerated
by
any
effective
military
organization.
there
may
have
been
armies
that
tolerated
that
kind
of
behavior
but
they
were
armies
on
the
verge
of
dissolution
and
not
armies
that
win
wars.
and
aside
from
the
tendency
to
disaffect
others,
statements
such
as
these
even
if
they
convince
no
one
of
a
deleterious
effect
upon
morale
because
they
signaled
to
others
that
at
least
one
man
in
the
unit
is
not
to
be
relied
upon.
it
is
already
disaffected
and
it
maybe
an
unreliable
and
dangerous
or
difficult
situation
which
i
think
is
surely
a
factor,
the
military
entitled
to
take
into
account.
it
is
apparent,
i
think
that
the
article
as
applied
in
this
case
was
not
unduly
vague
nor
does
it
violate
avrech’s
first
amendment
rights
since
those
rights
must
vary
according
to
the
time,
place
and
circumstance.
and
speech
of
this
sort
in
a
combat
zone
can
hardly
be
protected.
it
might
be
different
in
other
military
circumstances.
it
might
be
different
if
you
were
in
the
states
in
civilian
uniform
talking
to
man
off
base.
in
a
combat
zone
it
cannot
be
protected
speech
i
would
not
think.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
douglas
but
it
recognizes
that
each
of
these
standards
has
a
slightly
different
application
depending
upon
the
context
and
the
circumstances
in
which
it
must
be
applied.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
have
indeed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
frantz,
i
think
it
is
upheld
at
mr.
justice
stewart
within
the
last
year
or
two.
it’s
in
the
--
i
can
get
the
citation
for
you.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
quite
recently.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
it
was
the
frantz
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
that
is
an
argument
that
i
make
and
i
say
it
should
not
be
invalidated
on
its
face
again
for
two
other
reasons.
not
just
because
it
has
been
construed
so
often.
one
is
because
this
article
has
its
primary
impingement
upon
conduct
which
is
not
speech.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
i
think
as
i
say
for
one
thing
in
the
military
so
many
aspects
of
human
conduct
are
necessarily
regulated
that
are
left
completely
unregulated
in
civilian
life.
it
would
be
i
think
impossible
to
write
a
specific
and
definite
code
that
covered
all
of
the
things
that
might
prejudice
good
order
and
discipline
from
speech
to
non-speech.
that
being
the
case
to
strike
down
a
statute
like
this
on
its
face
i
think
makes
no
particular
sense.
you
would
have
to
strike
down
whatever
replaced
it
on
its
face
because
one
would
always
be
left
with
the
need
of
some
form
of
general
article.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
are
in
addition
areas
in
which
it
has
not
yet
been
applied
which
is
still
valid.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
did
give
that
speech
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
understand
that
i
am
informed
that
in
the
heated
debate
which
fall
on
this
publication
of
that
article
that
he
be
candid
slightly.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
had
not
occurred
to
me.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
need
it
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
because
civilian
society
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
stewart.
addressing
merely
the
speech
area,
i
think
that
there
are
numbers
of
ways
in
which
servicemen
can
find
prejudice
discipline
in
non-speech
ways
are
limitless
but
let’s
adjust
just
the
speech
area
which
is
only
a
minor
part
of
this
article.
one
ranges
from
the
serviceman
speaking
or
discussing
with
two
friends
off
base
over
a
drink
in
somebody’s
living
room
out
of
uniform.
the
aims
of
a
war
in
a
discursive
fashion
all
the
way
to
the
wide
variety
of
circumstances
to
the
serviceman
in
a
combat
zone
perhaps
in
actions
denouncing
what
they
are
doing
and
urging
others
to
pull
out
of
the
action.
there
are
so
many
gradations
and
variations
and
alterations
in
circumstances
between
there
that
i
cannot
imagine
that
one
could
draft
specific
articles
that
did
not
look
like
the
code,
the
internal
revenue
code
and
even
then
we
know
that
the
internal
revenue
code
has
its
areas
of
vagueness.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
it
would.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
certainly
would
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
they
are
too
many.
i
think
there
are
too
many
variations
and
circumstances
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
article
90
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
that’s
quite
correct
but
this
man
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
hardly
think
it’s
practical
mr.
justice
marshall
for
the
commanding
officer
to
go
about
catching
people.
investigating
people
to
see
what
they
were
likely
to
publish
and
then
issuing
an
order
not
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
that
would
be
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
no
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
does
not
look
to
me
like
that.
it
looks
to
me
like
unnecessarily
general
statement
because
it
is
impossible
in
any
length
sort
of
a
tax
code
which
would
not
give
notice
to
anybody
in
the
enlisted
level
to
convey
all
of
the
instances
in
which
the
military
may
object
to
behavior
being
obviously
prejudicial
to
good
order
and
discipline.
the
argument
you
will
make
that
the
commander
could
have
issued
a
direct
order
is
quite
true
but
that
would
be
an
argument
that
says
you
may
never
punish
for
any
attempt
to
do
anything
because
when
the
attempt
is
discovered,
the
commanding
officer
may
always
issue
an
order
not
to
do
it.
and
then
if
it’s
done,
he
may
be
punished
for
direct
disobedience
of
a
lawful
order
of
a
superior
commissioned
officer.
but
so
long
as
the
attempt
article
--
article
80
has
any
validity
and
i
don’t
think
it
is
questioned
for
this
that
is
valid
then
an
attempt
maybe
punished
although
the
commander
could
have
overlooked
it
and
just
issued
an
order.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
turns
on
the
constitutionality
of
article
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
that
article
punishes
among
other
things,
all
disorders
and
neglects
of
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
in
the
armed
forces.
in
all
conduct
of
a
nature
to
bring
this
credit
upon
the
armed
forces.
the
article
entered
our
military
jurisprudence
that
was
enacted
by
the
congress
in
1775
and
has
been
reenacted
repeatedly
since
then
by
congress.
the
first
reenactment
occurring
in
1806,
apparently
the
man
who
wrote
the
constitution
had
no
doubt
of
its
compatibility
with
this
article.
it’s
been
in
effect
as
an
organic
part
of
our
military
law
now
for
just
under
200
years
and
in
our
history
millions
and
tons
of
millions
of
service
man
and
woman
have
served
under
this
article.
it
is
a
settled
--
a
piece
of
our
jurisprudence,
i
suppose
as
there
is
at
stake,
in
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
article,
of
course
are
several
fundamental
values
of
our
society.
appellee
here
urges
the
values
of
fair
warning
in
due
process
and
free
speech.
i
will
attempt
to
show
that
article
134
is
fully
compatible
with
those
values
and
does
not
threaten.
but
must
also
be
recognized,
however,
is
that
the
judicial
destruction
of
article
134
would
jeopardize
two
other
important
values
in
our
society.
the
first
of
course
is
the
effect
of
those
american
armed
forces
upon
which
the
safety
of
the
nation
rests.
the
second,
however,
is
a
value
which
i
think
is
not
sufficiently
recognized.
and
that
is
the
importance
of
article
134
in
confining
the
role
of
the
military
in
our
national
political
processes
and
decisions.
should
speech
of
the
sort
involved
in
this
case
and
in
captain
levy’s
case
which
we
argue
next,
come
to
be
permitted
in
the
military?
there
would
be
real
danger
that
our
military
would
become
so
unreliable
as
to
frustrate
civilian
policy
to
be
unable
to
carry
out
civilian
policy.
but
worst
than
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
danger
of
a
politicized
military
establishment
with
all
the
dangers
that
prospect
poses
for
the
principle
of
civilian
control
of
the
military.
this
speech
in
these
cases
in
opposition
to
warnings
and
if
its
permissible
for
a
pfc
and
a
captain
to
make
these
publications
or
attempt
these
publications
and
make
these
speeches
under
these
circumstances,
then
i
do
not
see
why
it
will
not
be
permissible
equally
for
general
officers
and
admirals
to
address
their
troops
about
their
political
views
and
about
their
disagreement
with
the
president
of
united
states
and
about
their
disagreement
with
warnings.
we
are
not
dealing
with
small
issues
in
this
case.
the
appellee
mark
avrech
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
expunge
his
court-martial
conviction
which
was
under
article
80
which
punishes
attempts,
and
the
attempt
was
to
violate
article
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
the
district
court
dismissed
his
suit
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
article
134
as
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
conduct
underlying
this
court-martial
conviction
occurred
at
the
marble
mountain
air
facility
in
da
nang
in
vietnam
where
pfc
avrech
was
on
active
of
duty
with
the
marine
corps
in
a
combat
zone.
while
on
night
duty,
in
the
group
supply
officers
at
his
base,
avrech
typed
of
a
stencil
of
a
statement
entitled
“the
truth”
and
marked
volume
1,
number
1.
this
statement
is
set
out
in
full
at
pages
4
and
5
of
the
government’s
brief.
and
he
intended
to
circulate
it.
he
said
only
to
eight
or
10
of
his
friends
in
the
marine
corps.
the
statement
is
the
denunciation
of
the
united
states
military
rule
in
vietnam
and
it
contained
such
sentences
as
these.
“why
should
we
go
out
and
fight
there
in
the
south
vietnamese?
why
should
we
go
out
and
fight
with
their
battles
while
they
sit
home
and
complain
about
communist
aggression?
what
are
we
cannon
fodder
or
human
beings?”
going
on,
“the
united
states
has
no
business
over
here.
are
your
opinions
worth
risking
a
court-martial?
we
must
strive
for
peace
and
if
not
peace
then
a
complete
u.s.
withdrawal.
we
have
been
sitting
ducks
for
too
long.”
the
statement
is
more
extensive
than
that
and
that
is
in
tone
and
in
substance
a
denunciation
as
i
say
in
united
states
warnings.
i
think
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
had
pfc
avrech
succeeded
in
publishing
that
statement,
the
document
would
tend
to
create
disaffection
among
the
troops
and
it
would
certainly
create
lowered
morale
among
troops
in
a
combat
zone.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
certainly
would
stimulate
debate.
i
think
that
is
certainly
fair
mr.
chief
justice.
in
addition
to
that
apparently
although
he
was
not
charged
but
the
record
in
the
case
the
summary
of
the
record
in
the
case,
the
original
record
of
transcript
has
been
destroyed,
indicates
that
pfc
avrech
constantly
stimulated
debate
about
--
among
his
fellows,
about
the
wrongness
of
the
united
states
warnings.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
were
discussing
at
the
lunch
break
the
facts
of
this
case
having
typed
out
on
a
stencil
his
denunciation
of
the
warnings
in
united
states
for
circulation
to
the
troops
and
it
was
entitled
volume
1
part
1
because
pfc
avrech
testified
that
he
had
intended
to
publish
other
such
statements
as
his
thinking
developed
along
this
lines.
having
typed
up
this
first
statement,
avrech
attempted
to
gain
access
to
the
supply
office
mimeograph
machine
in
order
to
run
the
statement
off.
and
in
the
process
he
showed
in
to
a
corporal
who
controlled
the
machine,
the
corporal
took
the
statement
and
gave
it
to
a
superior
and
as
a
result,
avrech
was
tried
before
a
special
court-martial
on
charges
of
violating
articles
134
and
80.
the
court
martial
acquitted
him
on
the
article
134
charge
but
convicted
him
under
article
80
which
as
i
say
punishes
attempts
to
commit
offenses.
and
here
the
specification,
the
charge
under
article
80
charged
an
attempt
to
commit
an
offense
under
article
134
namely
an
attempt
to
publish
to
members
of
the
armed
forces
with
design
to
promote
disloyalty
and
disaffection
among
the
troops,
the
statement
disloyal
to
united
states.
this
charge
required
a
finding
of
specific
intent
and
was
modeled
on
a
standard
form,
contained
in
the
manual
for
court-martial.
upon
conviction,
avrech
was
reduced
in
rank
from
private
first
class
to
private,
sentenced
to
forfeiture
of
three
months’
pay,
and
sentenced
to
one
month
hard
labor
and
confinement.
the
commanding
officer
suspended
the
confinement
in
all
of
the
respects
to
the
regular
review
process
the
conviction
and
the
sentence
were
affirmed.
so
that
he
received
a
rather
mild
sentence
but
did
not
put
any
bad
conduct
discharge
in
his
record
and
did
not
confine
him
in
any
way.
the
appellee
challenged
this
conviction
under
one
fifth
amendment
doctrine
void
for
vagueness
and
two
aspects
of
first
amendment
doctrine
overbreadth
and
the
claim
that
the
statement
he
attempted
to
issue
was
protected
speech.
i
think
none
of
these
contentions
can
withstand
examination.
i
would
like
to
examine
the
vagueness
point
first.
i
think
it’s
essential
to
realize
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
parallel
statute
applied
to
the
civilian
population
would
be
unconstitutionally
vague.
nobody
would
know
in
a
free
and
permissive
society
what
was
conceivably
meant
by
something
like
disorders
and
neglects
to
the
prejudice
of
social
order.
the
difference
of
course
is
that
a
civilian
society
is
basically
a
free
society;
it
is
not
and
furthermore
it
has
no
single
mission
unlike
the
military.
the
military
society
is
an
ordered
society,
it
has
a
mission,
it
has
a
structure.
and
for
that
reason,
one
knows
what
tends
to
detract
from
that
mission,
what
tends
to
break
down
discipline
and
good
order.
now
counsel
for
the
appellee
argued
this
case
as
if
it
did
involve
a
statute
applied
to
the
civilian
population.
and
they
refused
i
think
to
face
the
only
issue,
the
real
issue
which
is
the
military
context
in
which
this
article
exists.
indeed
in
which
this
article
has
been
--
which
this
article
has
been
an
organic
part
for
200
years.
and
that
is
what
makes
all
the
difference
in
this
case.
that
context
and
the
limiting
constructions
given
by
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
give
article
134
the
definiteness
it
requires.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
military
context
did
not
give
it
sufficient
definiteness
mr.
justice
douglas
but
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
that
it
does.
one,
it
seems
to
me
extremely
telling
point
in
this
case
is
that
counsel
for
the
appellee
argued
this
case
by
a
series
of
hypothetic.
although
this
article
has
been
used
for
200
years,
they
do
not
cite
a
single
case
of
injustice
done
by
the
military
under
this
article.
they
do
not
cite
a
single
case
in
which
a
convicted
serviceman
could
not
--
in
which
a
convicted
serviceman
could
have
entertained
any
doubt
that
what
he
did
was
prejudicial
to
good
order
and
discipline
and
that
what
he
did
was
wrong
and
illegal
so
far
as
a
military
society
was
concerned.
whatever
superficial
plausibility
appellee's
challenge
has
is
gained
only
by
ignoring
the
meaning
given
by
military
function
in
context
by
ignoring
the
actual
operation
of
the
military
system
and
arguing
instead
from
wholly
imaginary
cases.
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
repeatedly
said
at
this
article
that
it
reaches
only
misconduct
and
disorders
which
are
directly
and
probably
prejudicial
to
good
order
and
discipline
so
that
the
construction
placed
upon
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
followed
by
the
courts-martial
is
that
the
tendency
to
injure
good
order
and
discipline
must
be
direct
and
it
must
be
obvious
or
reasonable
manner.
in
addition
to
that
of
course,
the
manual
for
courts-martial
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
discuses
at
page
7
(a)
this
article
and
the
specific
charge
of
disloyal
speech.
now,
knowledge
of
what
conduct
directly
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that’s
quite
true.
the
average
enlisted
man
is
not
although
more
enlisted
men
than
one
might
think
are.
particularly
enlisted
man
who
recognize
themselves
as
coming
into
--
brush
possibly
with
this
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know
that.
i
do
know
though
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
articles
of
war
--
the
articles
of
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
don’t
need
it
but
i
think
i
would
like
to
use
it
if
i
may.[laughter
attempt]
the
articles
are
explained
to
the
troops
as
part
of
their
basic
training.
the
manual
is
available
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
manual
is
really
as
available
to
an
enlisted
man
in
the
marine
corps
as
--
is
a
criminal
code
of
illinois
say
to
the
man
who
really
gets
under
pressure.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
manual
is
explained
and
the
articles
are
explained.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
correct.
but
aside
from
history
and
tradition,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
important
and
obvious
facts
about
this
case
is
that
the
military
does
comprise
a
specialized
community,
it
has
a
well
understood
and
a
specialized
function
which
is
something
a
civilian
community
does
not
have.
and
the
need
for
order
and
discipline
in
that
specialized
community
is
known
throughout
our
culture
and
it
is
obvious
to
everyone.
it
is
also
obvious
what
kinds
of
behavior
tend
to
break
that
down.
now,
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
military
use
of
this
kind
of
penal
statute
is
by
no
means
unique
in
our
law.
this
is
not
confined
to
military
law
of
any
means.
court’s
frequently
apply
standards
of
this
sort
when
they
are
given
content
by
an
understood
function
and
although
on
the
face
of
the
words
they
may
seem
vague
when
they
are
in
context
they
are
not
vague.
and
i
think
this
is
true
in
a
variety
of
areas
and
i
would
like
to
mention
a
few.
in
the
first
place
and
most
obviously
the
sherman
act
is
vague,
criminal
proscriptions
against
things
like
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
were
upheld
in
nash
against
united
states
largely
because
the
justice
holmes
said
because
of
the
antecedent
common
law
among
other
things.
the
antecedent
common
law
was
really
not
a
great
deal
of
help,
but
in
the
--
he
explained
further
in
international
harvester
against
kentucky
that
criminal
law
is
not
unconstitutional
merely
because
it
throws
upon
men
the
risk
of
rightly
estimating
a
matter
of
degree.
and
here
the
matter
of
degree
is
what
is
an
undue
restraint
of
trade.
between
the
obviously
illegal
and
the
plainly
lawful
there’s
a
gradual
approach
and
that
the
complexity
of
life
makes
it
impossible
to
draw
a
line
in
advance
without
an
artificial
simplification
that
would
be
unjust.
the
conditions
are
as
permanent
as
anything
human
and
conditions
there
of
course
were
the
conditions
of
trade
and
economics.
here
the
conditions
are
permission
and
understood
function
of
the
military.
and
the
great
body
of
precedents
on
the
civil
side
coupled
with
familiar
practice
make
it
comparatively
easy
for
common
sense
to
keep
to
what's
safe.
that
passage,
i
think
would
only
superficial
alterations
could
have
been
written
in
defense
of
article
134
and
article
134
if
i
may
say
so
is
if
anything
clear
than
the
sherman
act
was
before
that
we
received
construction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[voice
overlap]
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
may
i
speak
to
those
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
list
of
the
appendix
mr.
justice
stewart
requires
use
for
the
great
deal
of
caution.
if
you
will
look
at
those
cases
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
seem
to
have
mislaid
my
analysis
of
them,
a
number
of
them
for
example
are
cases
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
behavior
cited
there
was
not
a
violation
of
article
134.
those
are
merely
cases
when
somebody
was
charged.
and
in
addition
to
that,
for
example
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
not
mr.
justice
stewart
because
if
one
look
at
civilian
jurisprudence
and
look
at
the
number
of
cases
in
which
people
have
been
charged
of
murder
and
how
many
of
them
were
acquitted,
one
would
not
say.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
one
of
my
examples
here
is
man
slaughter
which
is
i
suppose
a
negligent
killing
under
the
circumstances
quite
vague
criminal
proscription.
but
i
wish
to
say
about
this
for
example
not
only
are
some
of
these
examples
in
the
appendix
held
not
to
be
violations
of
article
134.
in
addition,
some
of
them
are
not
described
fully
enough.
for
example,
cheating
at
bingo,
that
was
a
gentleman
who
was
calling
out
wrong
numbers
to
rig
the
game
with
serviceman
and
then
splitting
the
proceeds.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
[laughter
attempt]
jumping
off
a
ship
which
sounds
a
little
bit
carefree,
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
a
man
who
made
a
large
wages
and
he
would
do
a
back
flip
off
an
aircraft
carrier
in
motion
and
cause
the
navy
to
just
send
a
story
about
the
rescue.
these
are
cases
when
you
look
at
the
four
case,
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
case
here
in
which
it
is
not
--
in
which
a
member
is
convicted,
in
which
it
is
not
clear
that
it
should
have
known
so
that
the
conduct
was
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
or
that
it
was
served
as
discrediting
in
the
eyes
of
the
civilian
population
in
which
he
was
dealing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
certainly
is
correct,
your
honor
but
any
deviation
from
ideal
conduct
is
not
charged
under
this
article.
it
has
to
be
a
serious
direct
obvious
impact
upon,
prejudicial
impact
upon
good
order
and
discipline.
anyone
who
has
lived
among
troops
knows
that
if
deviations
from
ideal
conduct
were
prosecuted,
we
would
have
nothing
to
courts-martial.
it
is
not
the
way
this
article
is
used
and
i
think
some
attention
has
to
be
given
the
way
this
article
is
used
and
the
way
it
is
controlled
by
the
court
of
military
appeals,
and
indeed
by
the
reviewing
legal
steps
that
go
over
everyone
of
this
convictions.
but
i
have
mentioned
the
vagueness
of
the
sherman
act
which
was
saved
by
its
context
and
by
our
knowledge
of
economics,
the
criminal
offense
of
man
slaughter,
we
rely
upon
the
common
understanding
of
man
as
to
what
is
dangerously
negligent
behavior
in
a
vast
multiplicity
of
examples
that
would
be
beyond
the
skill
of
a
legislative
craftsman
to
reach.
now
if
i
turn
to
examples
involving
speech,
i
might
mention
that
courts
often
permit
indefinite
wording
if
context
gives
the
wording
meaning
and
a
parallel
example
it
seems
to
me
is
grayned
against
city
of
rockford.
and
this
court
there
upheld
a
conviction
under
anti-noise
ordinance
that
published
the
willful
making
of
noise
or
diversion
that
took
disturbs
or
tends
to
disturb
the
peace
or
good
order
of
schools.
interpreting
it
to
apply
to
actual
or
imminent
interference
with
peace
or
good
order
and
relying
upon
the
school
of
context
as
giving
meaning
to
disturbance
as
impact
on
the
normal
activities
of
the
school.
the
context
there
gave
fair
notice
and
i
think
the
context
of
the
military
gives
fair
notice
to
a
statute,
to
an
article
which
is
written
very
much
like
the
anti-noise
ordinance
was
in
grayned
against
city
of
rockford.
i
might
also
suggest
that
courts
regularly
apply
penalties
for
contempt
of
court.
that
would
seem
to
be
a
fairly
vague
standard
and
it
does
inhibit
speech
quite
directly
but
it
is
made
sufficiently
definite
by
the
common
understanding
of
the
function
of
a
courtroom.
the
function
of
the
legal
system
and
what
that
function
requires
in
the
way
of
good
order
and
discipline
by
the
part
of
attorneys
who
take
argument
in
the
courtroom.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
cite
as
very
close
to
this
case
the
clear
and
present
danger
test.
that
is
a
test
that
is
read
into
criminal
statutes
on
speech
about
over-throw
of
the
government
or
violence,
the
advocacy
of
violence.
and
hence
it
becomes
a
warning,
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
is
a
warning
that
must
be
intelligible
to
those
the
law
threatens.
and
in
dennis
against
united
states,
this
court
explained
those
words
as
follows.
it
said
that
chief
judge
learned
hand
writing
for
the
majority
below
interpreted
the
phrase
as
follows.
“in
each
case,
courts
must
ask
whether
the
gravity
of
the
evil
discounted
by
its
improbability
justify
such
invasion
of
free
speech
as
is
necessary
to
avoid
the
danger.”
then
this
court
said,
“we
adopt
this
statement
of
the
rule
as
articulated
by
chief
judge
hand,
is
as
succinct
and
inclusive
as
any
other
we
might
device
at
this
time.”
it
takes
into
consideration
those
factors
which
we
deem
relevant
and
relates
their
significances,
more
we
cannot
expect
from
words.
it
seems
to
me
that
article
134
is
certainly
no
vaguer
than
that
standard.
i
agree
that
more
we
cannot
expect
from
words,
i
think
more
we
cannot
expect
from
words
in
the
context
to
which
134
is
applied.
i
think
it
does
an
equally
good
job
of
relating
the
factors
and
their
significances.
and
there
is
one
other
parallel
i’d
like
to
draw
that
between
article
134
and
hatch
act.
this
court
was
upheld
the
hatch
act
last
term
in
the
civil
service
commission
against
national
association
of
letter
carriers.
and
at
this
point,
i’m
discussing
not
so
much
vagueness
as
overbreadth
and
the
legitimate
interest
of
government.
this
court
held
in
the
civilian
context
that
the
legitimate
interest
of
government
in
good
government
and
in
a
fair
political
process
was
enough
to
uphold
the
hatch
act’s
restrictions
upon
government
employee’s
political
activities
against
first
amendment
claims.
so
here
i
think
the
legitimate
interest
in
an
effective
military
and
in
a
military
that
does
not
dictate
civilian
policy
either
by
becoming
ineffective
so
that
it
cannot
carry
outlaws,
or
by
becoming
so
politicized
that
it
refuses
to
carry
out
the
policy
made
by
civilians,
justifies
article
134
has
very
limited
inhibitions
on
speech
just
as
the
hatch
act
was
justified
for
parallel
reasons.
in
this
case,
i
think
it’s
obvious
that
the
publication
average
would
have
published,
would
have
tended
to
spread
disaffection
among
troops
in
the
combat
zone
and
that
cannot
be
tolerated
by
any
effective
military
organization.
there
may
have
been
armies
that
tolerated
that
kind
of
behavior
but
they
were
armies
on
the
verge
of
dissolution
and
not
armies
that
win
wars.
and
aside
from
the
tendency
to
disaffect
others,
statements
such
as
these
even
if
they
convince
no
one
of
a
deleterious
effect
upon
morale
because
they
signaled
to
others
that
at
least
one
man
in
the
unit
is
not
to
be
relied
upon.
it
is
already
disaffected
and
it
maybe
an
unreliable
and
dangerous
or
difficult
situation
which
i
think
is
surely
a
factor,
the
military
entitled
to
take
into
account.
it
is
apparent,
i
think
that
the
article
as
applied
in
this
case
was
not
unduly
vague
nor
does
it
violate
avrech’s
first
amendment
rights
since
those
rights
must
vary
according
to
the
time,
place
and
circumstance.
and
speech
of
this
sort
in
a
combat
zone
can
hardly
be
protected.
it
might
be
different
in
other
military
circumstances.
it
might
be
different
if
you
were
in
the
states
in
civilian
uniform
talking
to
man
off
base.
in
a
combat
zone
it
cannot
be
protected
speech
i
would
not
think.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
douglas
but
it
recognizes
that
each
of
these
standards
has
a
slightly
different
application
depending
upon
the
context
and
the
circumstances
in
which
it
must
be
applied.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
have
indeed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
frantz,
i
think
it
is
upheld
at
mr.
justice
stewart
within
the
last
year
or
two.
it’s
in
the
--
i
can
get
the
citation
for
you.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
quite
recently.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
it
was
the
frantz
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
that
is
an
argument
that
i
make
and
i
say
it
should
not
be
invalidated
on
its
face
again
for
two
other
reasons.
not
just
because
it
has
been
construed
so
often.
one
is
because
this
article
has
its
primary
impingement
upon
conduct
which
is
not
speech.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
i
think
as
i
say
for
one
thing
in
the
military
so
many
aspects
of
human
conduct
are
necessarily
regulated
that
are
left
completely
unregulated
in
civilian
life.
it
would
be
i
think
impossible
to
write
a
specific
and
definite
code
that
covered
all
of
the
things
that
might
prejudice
good
order
and
discipline
from
speech
to
non-speech.
that
being
the
case
to
strike
down
a
statute
like
this
on
its
face
i
think
makes
no
particular
sense.
you
would
have
to
strike
down
whatever
replaced
it
on
its
face
because
one
would
always
be
left
with
the
need
of
some
form
of
general
article.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
are
in
addition
areas
in
which
it
has
not
yet
been
applied
which
is
still
valid.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
did
give
that
speech
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
understand
that
i
am
informed
that
in
the
heated
debate
which
fall
on
this
publication
of
that
article
that
he
be
candid
slightly.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
had
not
occurred
to
me.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
need
it
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
because
civilian
society
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
stewart.
addressing
merely
the
speech
area,
i
think
that
there
are
numbers
of
ways
in
which
servicemen
can
find
prejudice
discipline
in
non-speech
ways
are
limitless
but
let’s
adjust
just
the
speech
area
which
is
only
a
minor
part
of
this
article.
one
ranges
from
the
serviceman
speaking
or
discussing
with
two
friends
off
base
over
a
drink
in
somebody’s
living
room
out
of
uniform.
the
aims
of
a
war
in
a
discursive
fashion
all
the
way
to
the
wide
variety
of
circumstances
to
the
serviceman
in
a
combat
zone
perhaps
in
actions
denouncing
what
they
are
doing
and
urging
others
to
pull
out
of
the
action.
there
are
so
many
gradations
and
variations
and
alterations
in
circumstances
between
there
that
i
cannot
imagine
that
one
could
draft
specific
articles
that
did
not
look
like
the
code,
the
internal
revenue
code
and
even
then
we
know
that
the
internal
revenue
code
has
its
areas
of
vagueness.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
it
would.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
certainly
would
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
they
are
too
many.
i
think
there
are
too
many
variations
and
circumstances
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
article

that
is
quite
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
that’s
quite
correct
but
this
man
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
hardly
think
it’s
practical
mr.
justice
marshall
for
the
commanding
officer
to
go
about
catching
people.
investigating
people
to
see
what
they
were
likely
to
publish
and
then
issuing
an
order
not
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
that
would
be
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
no
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
does
not
look
to
me
like
that.
it
looks
to
me
like
unnecessarily
general
statement
because
it
is
impossible
in
any
length
sort
of
a
tax
code
which
would
not
give
notice
to
anybody
in
the
enlisted
level
to
convey
all
of
the
instances
in
which
the
military
may
object
to
behavior
being
obviously
prejudicial
to
good
order
and
discipline.
the
argument
you
will
make
that
the
commander
could
have
issued
a
direct
order
is
quite
true
but
that
would
be
an
argument
that
says
you
may
never
punish
for
any
attempt
to
do
anything
because
when
the
attempt
is
discovered,
the
commanding
officer
may
always
issue
an
order
not
to
do
it.
and
then
if
it’s
done,
he
may
be
punished
for
direct
disobedience
of
a
lawful
order
of
a
superior
commissioned
officer.
but
so
long
as
the
attempt
article
--
article
80
has
any
validity
and
i
don’t
think
it
is
questioned
for
this
that
is
valid
then
an
attempt
maybe
punished
although
the
commander
could
have
overlooked
it
and
just
issued
an
order.
