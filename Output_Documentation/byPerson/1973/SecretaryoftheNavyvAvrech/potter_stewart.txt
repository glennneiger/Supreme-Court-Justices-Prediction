justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general
you
said
earlier
that
your
brother
is
not
appointed
to
any
case
where
i
don’t
know
just
how
you
put
it.
i
think
where
there
has
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
i
think
you
said
whether
there
wasn’t
fair
notice
more
or
less,
but
i
am
looking
at
these
examples
in
the
appendix,
the
appellee’s
brief,
at
least
some
of
them
seem
to
me
to
be
arguably
while
they
are
all
of
course
conduct
falling
below
what
we
like
to
think
of
as
ideal.
some
of
them
have
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
good
order
and
discipline
of
the
armed
forces,
do
they?
i
mean
can
a
telephone
services
from
a
telephone
company
with
intent
to
defraud
for
example
or
negligent
failure
to
maintain
sufficient
bank
funds?
justice
potter
stewart
or
even
mistreatment
of
your
members
of
your
family
for
instance
or
refusing
to
testify
at
a
corners
in
quest?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
argue
that
both
ways
and
merely
i
would,
as
to
the
validity
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
well
but
we
know
what
murder
is.
it
does
involve
killing
another
human
being.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
assume
to
some
like
that,
that’s
why
i
didn’t
ask
you
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
any
deviation
from
ideal
conduct
by
a
man
in
uniform
tends
to
bring
discredit
upon
the
uniform
that
he
wears
and
the
military
organization,
to
which
he
belongs,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
explicitly
upheld
the
validity
of
article
134,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
how
recently?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event
quite
recently.
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
you
always
be
left
for
the
need
of
some
general
article?
i
understand
from
reading
these
briefs
over
the
weekend
but
i
don’t
have
in
mind,
i
think
it
was
a
former
high
ranking
military
officer
in
the
legal
department
who
has
written
an
article
or
given
a
speech
saying
to
the
effect
that
we
don’t,
the
military
doesn’t
need
this.
justice
potter
stewart
was
he
prosecuted
under
134?[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
all
seriousness,
why
do
you
say
then
there
is
--
the
military
needs
this?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
we
don’t
need
it
as
in
civilian
society.
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
say
it’s
diverse
and
permissive
and
free
and
the
military
is
an
authoritarian
organization
with
a
specific
mission.
i
understand
this
but
why
does
that
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
you
need
to
catch
all
thing
like
this.
what’s
wrong
with
spelling
out
what
you
don’t
want
soldiers
and
sailors
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
collateral
attack
but
i
mean
that
could
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case.
filed
in
the
district
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
no
custody
here.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
custody.
justice
potter
stewart
and
anybody
who
has
a
bad
conduct
discharge
walk
into
a
federal
district
court
and
ask
for
declaratory
judgment.

stewart
