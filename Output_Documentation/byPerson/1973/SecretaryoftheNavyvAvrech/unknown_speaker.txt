unknown
speaker
i
take
that
any
major
argument
is
that
that
because
the
article
has
been
construed
so
often
and
has
been
held
to
--
it
includes
so
many
things
that
the
very
least
it
should
not
be
invalidated
on
its
face.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
it
should
be
declared
invalid
on
its
face
in
connection
with
any
crime
that
should
be
tested
before
vagueness
has
applied.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
bowman
you
said
we
should
reach
it.
how
do
you
read
what
justice
clark
did
in
the
court
of
appeals?
did
he
invalidate
it
on
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
facially.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
mr.
bowman,
i
wonder
if
i
may
interrupt
you
before
you
get
fully
launched
on
your
argument
on
the
merits.
it
struck
me
there
might
be
a
question
here
about
the
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
this
isn’t
a
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
this
was
--
and
wasn’t
a
case
for
back
pay
in
the
court
of
claims?
unknown
speaker
what
form
in
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
generally
speaking
as
we
both
know
the
military
system
of
justice
is
quite
unrelated
to
the
civilian
courts
and
generally
the
only
place
where
there
is
an
intersection
of
their
jurisdiction
is
on
writ
of
habeas
corpus
attacking
the
very
jurisdiction
of
the
military
court,
isn’t
that
correct?
i
mean
other
cases
like
the
murdering
wives
cases
and
those
--
unknown
speaker
we
are
not
exhausting
administrative
remedies
anyway?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
about
the
jurisdiction,
does
your
jury
jurisdictional
question.
unknown
speaker
he
was
deprived
of
the
constitutional
right,
say
he
could.
unknown
speaker
i
say
if
that
was
your
case.
unknown
speaker
i
think
mr.
bowman
that
as
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
i
am
quite
certain
that
i
did,
he
freely
acknowledged
and
conceded
that
this
--
that
if
this
very
section
of
a
criminal
code,
federal
or
state,
it
would
be
unconstitutionally
vague
and
in
that
way
you
are
rather
been
asked
part
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
upheld
the
conviction
for
conduct
“a”
and
it
said
that
that
conduct
is
within
134.
let’s
assume
that
it
is
done
so
a
hundred
times.
now,
why
would
be
the
--
why
would
that
section
that
article
be
vague
as
to
someone
who
--
now
is
about
to
engage
in
the
same
company?
unknown
speaker
this
very
firmly
held
otherwise
in
upholding
the
validity
of
a
statute
that
talked
in
terms
of
the
detestable
and
abominable
crime
against
nature
and
held
that
a
judicial
construction
of
it
gave
forth
fair
warning.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
true
that
we
certainly
took
that
approach
last
year
in
water
carriers.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn’t
a
criminal
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
a
lot
of
cases,
say
once
the
statute
has
been
construed
as
just
as
though
the
--
i
read
that
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
so,
you’d
also
be
conceding
that
the
enforcing
authorities
wouldn’t
have
any
roving
authority
about
that
kind.
unknown
speaker
alright
that
may
be
but
nevertheless
to
that
extent
statute
in
this
case
should
not
be
declared
invalid
on
its
face.
if
the
statute
has
ever
been
construed
in
the
manner
that
we
have
been
talking,
the
statute
should
not
be
declared
for
invalid
on
its
face
here.
unknown
speaker
you
must
be
saying
under
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
never
construed
article
134
definitely
to
include
certain
conduct.
unknown
speaker
i
have
said
that.
unknown
speaker
right
how
about
the
once
that
it
--
where
it
has
to
affirm
convictions.
unknown
speaker
engaging
in
certain
conduct.
unknown
speaker
oh
no!
not
limited
but
at
least
for
the
next
fellow
who
does
not
engage
in
that
context.
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
of
variety
of
overbreadth
but
you
are
because
something
--
the
statute
still
could
be
vague
as
to
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
not
for
that
particular
conduct.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
affirms
a
conviction
for
certain
kinds
of
conduct
it
seems
to
me
it
has
said
that
134
covers
it.
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
any
major
argument
is
that
that
because
