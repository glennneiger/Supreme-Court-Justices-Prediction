justice
thurgood
marshall
solicitor,
the
average
enlisted
men
is
not
familiar
with
the
manual
at
all,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
wonder
how
many
manuals
of
courts-martial
they
have
in
vietnam
altogether?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
just
wondering
if
you
need
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
just
wondering
if
you
need
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
manual
isn't
explained
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
although
he
doesn’t
read
the
manual
himself.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
solicitor
on
this
one
way
we’d
be
urging
him
not
to
fight
wouldn’t
it
be
violating
conduct
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
such
as
specific
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
on
all
of
those
you
mentioned
specific
ones
that
could
be
covered
by
specific
article.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
particular
case
if
the
commanding
officer
had
said,
“private,
do
not
distribute
that”
and
he
distributed
it,
he
would
be
charged
with
what?
disobeying
an
order.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
wouldn’t
have
to
go
to
this
indefinite
one
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
first
place
he
goes
said
don’t
use
that
mimeograph
machine
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood
that
this
was
given
to
the
commanding
officer.
this
piece
of
paper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
that
stage
the
commanding
officer
could
have
said
one
or
two
things.
this
can’t
be
mimeograph,
it
can’t
be
distributed
or
he
could
order
them
not
to
distribute
it
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
instead
of
that,
you
bring
him
in
on
this
charge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
why
it
seems
to
me
that
the
availability
of
this
is
if
you
don’t
want
to
go
to
the
other
ones,
well
you
always
get
this
one.
well
doesn’t
it
look
to
you
like
the
one
where
if
you
can’t
get
to
anything
else,
i
got
you
on
this
one.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
you
win
would
that
open
up
every
bad
misconduct
charge
to
come
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
you.
i
am
talking
about
few
other
bad
conduct
discharges
and
few
others.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
all
have
a
course
of
action
for
declaratory
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
might
not
be
prepared
but
don’t
we
have
to
find
out
whether
or
not
we
have
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
jurisdiction
is
always
open.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
two
of
you
can
give
us
jurisdiction
by
agreement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
solicitor
general
said
the
fact
that
you’re
in
the
army
gives
you
a
little
more
knowledge
than
you
would
in
civilian
life.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
do
you
agree
that
after
you
have
been
in
the
army
about
30
days,
you
realize
that
you
for
various
reasons
you
find
out
you
don’t
have
the
same
freedom
of
speech
you
have
at
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
know
that
it
is
a
little
less.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
though
that
was
the
solicitor’s
point
that
in
that
framework,
the
longer
you
were
in
there
and
you
began
to
understand
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
limited
to
this
134
there
are
a
lot
of
other
ways
you
can
learn
not
only
134.
