mr.
dorian
bowman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
question
which
this
court
must
face
is
the
validity
of
article
134
and
in
the
course
of
my
argument
i
will
indicate
why
it
is
necessary
to
reach
that
issue
without
regard
to
the
specific
conduct
involved.
now
at
the
very
outset,
the
government
argues
that
balance
against
the
important
--
admittedly
important
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes
he
invalidated
the
first
two
clauses,
your
honor.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes.
i
am
sorry,
facially.
the
government
argues
that
balance
against
the
admittedly
valid,
admittedly
important
values
of
fair
warning
and
due
process,
one
should
balance
the
value
of
preventing
politicizing
the
armed
forces.
i
want
to
make
clear
that
whether
or
not
the
court
upholds
article
134
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
civilian
control
of
the
army.
if
there
is
particular
conduct
that
the
army
is
concerned
about
then
it
should
punish
it
under
clearly
existing
and
well
defined
statute
or
pass
a
new
statute.
you
cannot
uphold
an
otherwise
invalid
statute
just
because
you
don’t
like
certain
behavior.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
it’s
not.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
if
you
are
raising
the
collateral
attack
point
your
honor,
this
court
has
long
ago
as
smith
v.
whitney,
dynes
v.
hoover,
swaim
v.
united
states
raquel
v.
united
states
were
all
collateral
attack
cases.
they
were
not
habeas
cases.
smith
v.
whitney,
dynes
v.
hoover
were
brought
in
the
district
court,
district
of
columbia
whose
jurisdiction
was
the
same
as
the
district
court
here
when
it
was
brought.
furthermore,
in
this
court’s
case
of
gusik
v.
schneider
in
footnote
3
although
it
was
a
habeas
case,
the
court
explicitly
recognized
in
footnote
3
that
collateral
attacks
could
be
brought
by
methods
other
than
habeas
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
burns
v.
wilson
concurring
also
recognized
the
fact
that
collateral
attacks
could
be
broad.
i
might
say
that
the
government
--
this
issue
has
not
been
--
has
not
been
briefed
here,
it
wasn’t
raised
by
the
government
but
i
think
what
i
have
just
said,
this
is
sufficient
answer
to
this
court
has
held
that.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
am
sorry,
it
was
collateral
attack
to
set
aside
a
court-martial
conviction
on
the
same
grounds.
dynes
v.
hoover
of
course
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
here?
yes.
mr.
dorian
bowman
it
was
filed
in
district
court,
district
of
columbia
under
--
well,
we
had
jurisdiction
under
11-521.
also
and
which
did
not
i
might
add
at
that
time
require
a
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount.
we
also
filed
under
1331
and
alleged
$10,000.00
was
a
controversy
and
that
was
never
controverted
and
the
question
was
never
raised
by
the
government.
now
the
suggestion
that
that
to
this
court
that
in
deciding
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no
but
they
upheld
--
the
method
of
attempting
to
declare
the
court-martial
conviction
invalid,
i
admit
that
the
form
–
mr.
dorian
bowman
smith
v.
whitney
was
a
writ
of
prohibition
i
believe
brought
in
the
district
court.
dynes
v.
hoover
was
a
--
i’m
trying
to
remember
was
a
collateral
--
was
a
collateral
--
i
frankly
don’t
know.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes
well
in
--
but
in
burns
v.
wilson
it
was
not
attacking
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
your
honor
nor
was
in
gusik
v.
schneider
and
this
court
in
those
cases
did
not
state
and
certainly
didn’t
hold
that
habeas
corpus
was
the
only
method
by
which
one
could
bring
a
collateral
attack
against
a
court-martial
jurisdiction.
our
case
goes
to
the
very--
i
mean
obviously
as
the
statute
itself
under
which
the
court
was
operating.
mr.
dorian
bowman
excuse
me,
because
our
client
--
he
was
sentenced
to
three
months
in
prison
as
which
the
sentence
was
suspended.
so
he
couldn’t
have
possibly
brought
habeas
and
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
excuse
me.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no.
there
was
no
custody
and
i
might
say
that
to
limit
it
to
habeas
obviously
would
--
would
in
effect
give
the
military
control
of
who
could
bring
suits
and
who
could
not
because
as
in
this
case
they
could
simply
suspend
the
portion
of
the
sentence,
the
person
wouldn’t
be
in
custody
and
you
couldn’t
bring
suit.
now,
the
suggestion
--
again
i
might
say
that
that
--
at
that
court
should
reach
this
issue.
i
don’t
think
it
should
reach
it
without
full
briefing
because
the
issue
was
never
raised
below
and
hasn’t
been
--
hasn’t
frankly
been
brief
here.
now
the
suggestion
to
the
court
that
in
deciding
--
that
the
government
suggestion
to
the
court
in
deciding
the
question
of
the
validity
of
134,
this
court
should
not
be
misled
into
thinking
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
values
which
have
led
this
court
to
invalidate
vague
statutes
and
the
values
which
are
suggested
by
the
government.
now
turning
to
article
134,
i
think
the
significant
thing
about
article
134
is
that
it
has
always
been
recognized
to
be
broad
and
indefinite
and
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
all
the
historical
evidence
regarding
the
writers,
british
writers
going
back
to
the
1800s
and
the
american
military
writers
who
have
recognized
that
this
article
was
indefinite.
and
we
have
also
presented
testimony
of
congressional
hearings
in
1912,
1919,
1949
in
which
it
was
also
recognized
that
the
article
was
--
that
the
language
of
the
article
was
indefinite
and
the
government
doesn’t
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
because
your
honor
he
had
a
--
he
received
a
bad
conduct
discharge
your
honor.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
he
received
a
bad
conduct
discharge
taking
into
effect
two
convictions
because
following
this
conviction
your
honor.
he
was
convicted
i
believe
for
theft
of
a
camera,
your
honor.
so
taking
that,
the
military
took
both
of
them
into
account.
it’s
in
the
record,
specifically
to
both
into
account
and
giving
him
the
type
of
discharge
which
was
given
to
him.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i’ll
be
perfectly
honest
your
honor,
i
really
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
i
don’t
think
so,
if
we
win
--
well
if
we
win
on
this
perfectly
frankly,
i
will
go
back
and
attempt
to
get
to
his
type
of
discharge
here.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
am
not
prepared
at
this
time
to
talk
about
the
retroactivity
of
the
decision
your
honor.
it
would
only
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
i
think
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
that
i
believe
that
the
court
would
then
have
to
consider
the
type
of
situation
which
was
i
think
in
the
o’callahan
situation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
factors
which
were
involved
there
should
be
applied
to
allow
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
he
was
--
first
he
is
being
deprived
of
constitutional
right
here
too.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
think
so,
again
i
frankly
say
it’s
not
then
briefed,
i
am
really
not
very
familiar
with
the
cases
upon
that
this
court
decided
following
o’callahan
v.
parker
as
to
whether
or
not
who
could
come
in.
i
think
that
if
this
was
the
only
--
i’m
really
not
prepared
to
discuss
that,
your
honor
because
frankly
i
am
not
really
familiar
with
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
think
yes
and
i
think
if
your
honors
decide
the
issue
is
one
that
merits
full
consideration.
i
think
the
party
should
be
given
a
chance
to
brief
it
because
it
hasn’t
been
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
your
honor
i
realize
this
is
the
issue
and
i
am
only
urging
that
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
fully
agree
with
that
but
if
the
--
if
this
court
decides
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
really
an
important
one
in
all
collateral
attack,
i
really
think
that
it
should
be
briefed
fully
and
shouldn’t
be
done
just
on
this
record
and
frankly
on
cases
that
i
am
not
absolutely
and
completely
familiar
with
and
that
it
hasn’t
been
raised
below
ever.
now
the
government
really
doesn’t
seriously
challenge
the
historical
evidence
and
really
makes
no
effort
to
defend
the
language
itself.
and
grayned
v.
city
of
rockford
tells
us
that
statutes
such
as
this
are
vague
and
should
be
judged
on
their
face.
they
are
vague
because
they
offend
several
important
values.
one,
lack
of
fair
warning.
two,
lack
of
guidance
to
the
enforcing
authorities
leaving
them
with
uncontrolled
discretion
and
thirdly
where
statutes
affect
to
first
amendment
rights,
it
must
be
narrowly
drawn
to
save
this
from
the
vice
of
overbreadth.
and
a
statute
which
violates
anyone
of
these
values
should
be
struck
down.
now
the
government’s
principle
argument
regarding
a
projecting
is
that
the
court
shouldn’t
reach
the
statute
on
its
face.
and
the
government’s
position
apparently
is
that
if
avrech
was
aware
that
his
conduct
was
prohibited
by
article
134
that
ends
the
question
of
vagueness.
although,
we
don’t
concede
that
avrech
in
effect
had
fair
warning.
the
fallacy
of
the
government’s
argument
is
that
it
completely
ignores
the
second
value
which
is
a
lack
of
standards
to
guide
the
enforcing
authorities.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
you
cannot
leave
it
to
the
enforcing
authorities
to
determine
what
conduct
falls
within
a
statute.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
realize
that
i
was
--
i
didn’t
--
the
way
i
understood
i
didn’t
understand
that
he
would
concede
that
you
would
approach
it
on
its
face.
and
that
was
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
if
indeed
that
was
it,
i
gladly
accept
the
concession
that
the
court
should
have
reached
the
statute
on
its
face.
the
government
argues
then
that
if
the
court
reaches
the
statute
on
its
face
that
the
statute
is
not
invalid
and
it
sets
forth
several
reasons
both
in
its
brief
and
here
on
oral
argument
as
to
why
the
statute
is
not
invalid.
they
argue
in
the
brief
at
least
that
there’s
a
custom
in
practice
in
the
military
as
to
what
offenses
are
covered.
now
i
acknowledge
of
course
that
in
dynes
v.
hoover,
this
court
although
recognizing
the
apparent
in
the
terminus
of
the
article
held
that
there
was
a
custom
in
practice
in
the
military
as
to
what
offenses
are
covered.
well
i
suggest
to
you
that
what
this
court
did,
that
the
times
have
changed
since
dynes
v.
hoover.
dynes
v.
hoover
was
only
concerned
or
involved
itself
of
the
situation
where
there
was
a
small
professional
army.
now,
however
the
armies
have
obviously
changed
that
it
were
up
to
the
kind
of
this
conviction,
two
to
three
million
men
and
you
cannot
say
that
practical
men
in
the
navy
or
army
know
what
is
covered
by
this
article.
secondly,
the
history
of
the
article
has
certainly
changed
since
100
years
ago.
the
article
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
really
covers
a
growing
number
of
offenses.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
make
that
point
that
he
was
not
in
fact
aware.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
the
only
thing
that
he
said
your
honor
is
that,
“are
your
opinions
worth
risking
a
court-martial?
”and
that
we
urge
is
really
different
from
knowing
that
whether
or
not
your
conduct
is
covered
by
this
statute.
all
he
said
--
i
mean
i
think
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
but
he
has
to
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
think
he
has
to
know
something
more
than
that
his
views
are
going
to
be
displeasing
to
the
military.
and
even
if
he
did
have
fair
warning
which
again
as
i
say
he
didn’t.
that
doesn’t
meet
the
question
of
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
because
you
are
still
left
with
the
second
vice,
namely
the
failure
to
revive
guidance
for
enforcing
authorities.
moreover
the
government
--
if
you
are
looking
at
the
term
disloyalty
in
the
manual,
the
government
in
its
brief
freely
concedes
that
the
term
disloyalty
in
the
manual
is
vague
and
is
indefinite
and
you
cannot
tell
in
advance
the
government
states
in
his
brief
as
to
what
type
of
conduct
falls
within
the
manual's
definition
of
disloyalty.
now,
the
government
doesn’t
say
in
its
brief,
what
this
custom
in
practice
or
where
it
may
be
found.
and
it
suggests
that
perhaps
it
can
be
found
in
the
manual.
but
it
also
admits
that
the
manual
is
only
an
illustrative
guide
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
frequently
held
that
the
listing
of
an
offense
in
the
manual
doesn’t
mean
it’s
covered
by
article
134
and
it
is
also
held
that
the
failure
to
list
an
offense
in
the
manual
doesn’t
mean
that
it
is
not
covered.
so
the
manual
can
possibly
tell
you
what
is
custom
in
practice.
mr.
justice
clark
below
said
that
the
manual
is
only
a
mini
digest
of
the
roving
character
of
article
134.
now
the
government
suggests
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
because
--
well
first
i
would
argue
of
course
that
fair
warning
this
court
has
always
held
that
fair
warning
must
be
given
by
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
that
is
true
and
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
i
would
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
it
was
not
a
criminal
statute.
it
is
regulatory
statute
and
i
would
concede
i
think
after
i
say
--
the
argument
that
fair
warnings
be
given.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
would
say
that
if
there
was
a
specific
--
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
specifically
said
that
the
type
of
conduct
he
has
engaged
in
is
covered
by
article
134
then
i
would
have
to
concede
that
yes
indeed
he
did
that
very
well.
mr.
dorian
bowman
about
that
particular
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
dorian
bowman
if
that
is
the
case
but
that
is
not
the
case
here,
your
honor.
i
concede
that
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
said
that
this
particular
conduct
in
this
particular
circumstance
is
covered
by
the
statute
that
is
true
but
that
is
not
true
here.
mr.
dorian
bowman
that
is
quite
correct.
it
has
not
indeed
as
i
say,
it
has
stated
that
the
failure
to
list
an
offense
doesn’t
mean
that
it
cannot
be
covered
by
article
134.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes
but
the
court
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
it
has
affirmed
conviction
but
it
has
never
said
what
article
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
but
it
has
never
said
that
article
134
is
limited
to
that
conduct
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
in
that
particular
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes.
mr.
dorian
bowman
that
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
specifically
said,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
your
honor
but
it
doesn’t
done
that
with
respect
to
the
particular
conduct
that
we
are
involved
in
here.
now,
the
government
suggests
that
apart
from
what
the
manual
represents
as
a
repository
of
custom
in
practice
that
the
manual
gives
fair
warning.
now
the
inadequacy
of
this
is
as
i
have
shown
with
regard
to
custom
in
practice
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
frequently
held
that
offenses
which
are
not
covered
can
still
be
charged
under
134.
in
addition,
new
offenses
are
added
every
single
time
you
have
new
additions
of
the
manual.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
disloyalty
provision
here
was
added
in
1951
after
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
was
enacted
and
you
cannot
say
here
that
there
was
any
considered
legislative
judgment
that
this
particular
type
of
conduct
should
be
covered.
now,
the
government’s
principal
argument
i
think
really
goes
to
the
question
of
what
the
constitutional
rules
of
vagueness
which
we
have
been
discussing
had
any
application
to
the
military.
and
the
government
must
offer
some
justification
why
the
rules
for
the
military
should
be
different
and
it’s
not
enough
to
say
just
that
the
military
is
involved.
this
court
has
always
taken
the
approach
that
the
party
who
wishes
to
relax
constitutional
principles
must
have
the
burden
of
showing
why
those
principles
should
not
apply
in
a
particular
situation.
and
this
court
indicated
in
frontiero
and
toth
v.
quarles
that
this
rule
certainly
applies
to
the
military.
and
the
highest
military
courts
in
jacoby
and
tentia
(ph)
and
the
lower
federal
court
have
taken
that
approach
as
well
as
the
two
circuit
courts
here.
and
there
are
compelling
reasons
i
think
why
the
constitutional
standards
of
vagueness
should
apply
to
the
military.
in
the
first
case,
we
have
people
in
the
military
who
are
draftees
or
volunteers
who
live
their
civilian
life
for
at
least
a
period
of
two
years.
they
give
up
their
civilian
life.
they
make
sacrifices
and
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
why
with
regard
to
knowledge,
why
they
should
not
have
the
same
protections
with
regard
to
statutes
that
civilians
have.
furthermore,
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
is
a
penal
statute.
it’s
a
penal
statute
and
it
is
no
different
from
any
other
civilian
penal
statute.
it
imposes
penalties,
people
can
go
to
jail
for
this
and
there
is
no
reason
why
different
standard
should
apply.
and
the
government
offers
nothing
here
really
than
code
words
and
slogan
such
as
military
necessity
and
instead
of
any
analysis
of
the
issue.
now
i
admit
that
it
may
be
convenient
for
the
military
to
have
a
vague
and
overbroad
statute.
indeed
all
enforcing
authorities
i
am
sure
have
come
and
would
find
it
convenient
to
have
such
a
broad
statute.
to
have
an
open-ended
statute
but
that
is
precisely
why
this
court
has
struck
down
such
statutes
because
you
can’t
give
enforcing
authorities
wide
and
uncontrolled
discretion.
now
there
are
indeed
with
regard
to
solicitor
general’s
argument
that
the
military
needs
article
134,
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
at
least
several
military
man
who
don’t
agree
with
that,
who
say
that
we
can
get
by
without
article
134.
and
chief
judge,
the
army
board
of
review,
general
hodson
said
that
and
the
secretary
of
defense
own
task
force
on
the
administration
of
justice
recommend
that
article
i
which
included
by
the
way
the
judge
advocate
generals
recommended
that
article
134
be
abolished.
and
i
suggest
for
any
conduct
that
the
military
doesn’t
like,
they
have
a
very
simple
solution
and
that’s
to
go
to
congress
and
enact
specific
punitive
articles.
they
have
done
this
before
and
uniform
code
of
military
justice
was
adopted
in
1949.
there
was
certain
conduct
covered
by
article
134
which
was
--
which
were
made
into
specific
punitive
articles.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
presume
you
would
run
--
i
presume
--
i
think
you
could
draw
a
statute.
i
frankly
haven’t
thought
of
the
word
which
would
prohibit
all
--
which
prohibit
the
--
let’s
say
the
publication
of
any
statement
which
let’s
say
draws
into
question
of
governmental
policy.
i
think
you
would
then
of
course
run
into
the
first
amendment.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
frankly,
i
would
be
perfectly
honest,
your
honor
i
can’t.
i
have
not
thought
about
a
statute
sufficiently
to
draw
it
up
just
without
thinking
about
it.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
i
am
saying
that
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no.
if
there
is
a
particular
conduct
which
the
army
doesn’t
like,
they
should
go
and
enact
specific
articles.
i
am
not
prepared
this
time
to
draft
the
statute
right
now
as
what
could
be
covered.
i
think
that
you
could
draft
a
statute;
you
might
of
course
in
this
particular
context
run
into
first
amendment
question
as
to
whether
they
could
validly
pass
a
statute.
with
whether
such
i
would
withstand
this
court
scrutiny
but
frankly,
your
honor
i
am
not
prepared
to
this
time
draft
the
statute
which
might
cover
this
activity.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
your
honor
i
take
issue
with
that.
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
think
that’s
true
and
i
think
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
that
is
certainly
true
your
honor
but
it
is
certainly
no
indication
if
you
look
at
the
statute
at
the
manual
as
to
what
you
can
or
cannot
do.
obviously
when
you
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
i
agree
that
it
is
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
think
you
begin
to
understand
that
anything
you
do
which
the
commanding
officer
might
not
like,
you
do
risk
punishment
under
article
134.
i
admit
that
the
freedom
of
speech
is
less.
that
does
not
mean
and
i
won’t
go
into
it
now,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
the
test
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
that’s
true
but
article
134
does
stand
in
this
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
oh!
i
have
heard
about
kp
your
honor.
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
i
believe
suggested
to
the
solicitor
general,
if
the
military
could
easily
have
given
an
order
or
your
honor
did
and
order
not
to
do
what
he
did.
it
was
very
simple.
now
in
the
few
moments
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
i
think
it
would
certainly
have
taken
care
of
this
problem,
would
probably
take
care
of
a
lot
of
problems
in
the
military.
yes
if
you
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
i
don’t
think,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
the
way
that
cover
this
type
of
conduct
is
to
enact
specific
punitive
articles.
in
the
few
moments
remaining,
i
would
just
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
overbreadth.
article
134,
the
government
concedes
at
least
in
its
brief
reaches
first
amendment
--
reaches
first
amendment
activities
and
the
court
has
struck
down
statutes
and
if
government
concedes
that
the
court
has
struck
down
statutes
on
their
face
it
would
reach
first
amendment
activities.
the
government’s
point
here
is
that
since
article
134
covers
conduct
outside
of
the
first
amendment
as
well
as
within
the
first
amendment,
this
court
should
not
consider
the
statute
on
its
face.
now
the
government
cites
no
case
for
that
proposition.
frankly,
i
know
of
no
case
holding
that
because
a
statute
can
cover
all
types
of
conduct,
it
should
be
held
overbroad
because
it
impinges
on
the
first
amendment.
this
statute
because
it
is
all
embraced
it
covers
a
whole
variety
of
activity
including
first
amendment
activities
and
is
therefore
overbroad
and
should
be
struck
down.
thank
you.
mr.
dorian
bowman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
question
which
this
court
must
face
is
the
validity
of
article
134
and
in
the
course
of
my
argument
i
will
indicate
why
it
is
necessary
to
reach
that
issue
without
regard
to
the
specific
conduct
involved.
now
at
the
very
outset,
the
government
argues
that
balance
against
the
important
--
admittedly
important
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes
he
invalidated
the
first
two
clauses,
your
honor.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes.
i
am
sorry,
facially.
the
government
argues
that
balance
against
the
admittedly
valid,
admittedly
important
values
of
fair
warning
and
due
process,
one
should
balance
the
value
of
preventing
politicizing
the
armed
forces.
i
want
to
make
clear
that
whether
or
not
the
court
upholds
article
134
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
civilian
control
of
the
army.
if
there
is
particular
conduct
that
the
army
is
concerned
about
then
it
should
punish
it
under
clearly
existing
and
well
defined
statute
or
pass
a
new
statute.
you
cannot
uphold
an
otherwise
invalid
statute
just
because
you
don’t
like
certain
behavior.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
it’s
not.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
if
you
are
raising
the
collateral
attack
point
your
honor,
this
court
has
long
ago
as
smith
v.
whitney,
dynes
v.
hoover,
swaim
v.
united
states
raquel
v.
united
states
were
all
collateral
attack
cases.
they
were
not
habeas
cases.
smith
v.
whitney,
dynes
v.
hoover
were
brought
in
the
district
court,
district
of
columbia
whose
jurisdiction
was
the
same
as
the
district
court
here
when
it
was
brought.
furthermore,
in
this
court’s
case
of
gusik
v.
schneider
in
footnote
3
although
it
was
a
habeas
case,
the
court
explicitly
recognized
in
footnote
3
that
collateral
attacks
could
be
brought
by
methods
other
than
habeas
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
burns
v.
wilson
concurring
also
recognized
the
fact
that
collateral
attacks
could
be
broad.
i
might
say
that
the
government
--
this
issue
has
not
been
--
has
not
been
briefed
here,
it
wasn’t
raised
by
the
government
but
i
think
what
i
have
just
said,
this
is
sufficient
answer
to
this
court
has
held
that.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
am
sorry,
it
was
collateral
attack
to
set
aside
a
court-martial
conviction
on
the
same
grounds.
dynes
v.
hoover
of
course
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
here?
yes.
mr.
dorian
bowman
it
was
filed
in
district
court,
district
of
columbia
under
--
well,
we
had
jurisdiction
under
11-521.
also
and
which
did
not
i
might
add
at
that
time
require
a
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount.
we
also
filed
under
1331
and
alleged
$10,000.00
was
a
controversy
and
that
was
never
controverted
and
the
question
was
never
raised
by
the
government.
now
the
suggestion
that
that
to
this
court
that
in
deciding
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no
but
they
upheld
--
the
method
of
attempting
to
declare
the
court-martial
conviction
invalid,
i
admit
that
the
form
–
mr.
dorian
bowman
smith
v.
whitney
was
a
writ
of
prohibition
i
believe
brought
in
the
district
court.
dynes
v.
hoover
was
a
--
i’m
trying
to
remember
was
a
collateral
--
was
a
collateral
--
i
frankly
don’t
know.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes
well
in
--
but
in
burns
v.
wilson
it
was
not
attacking
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
your
honor
nor
was
in
gusik
v.
schneider
and
this
court
in
those
cases
did
not
state
and
certainly
didn’t
hold
that
habeas
corpus
was
the
only
method
by
which
one
could
bring
a
collateral
attack
against
a
court-martial
jurisdiction.
our
case
goes
to
the
very--
i
mean
obviously
as
the
statute
itself
under
which
the
court
was
operating.
mr.
dorian
bowman
excuse
me,
because
our
client
--
he
was
sentenced
to
three
months
in
prison
as
which
the
sentence
was
suspended.
so
he
couldn’t
have
possibly
brought
habeas
and
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
excuse
me.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no.
there
was
no
custody
and
i
might
say
that
to
limit
it
to
habeas
obviously
would
--
would
in
effect
give
the
military
control
of
who
could
bring
suits
and
who
could
not
because
as
in
this
case
they
could
simply
suspend
the
portion
of
the
sentence,
the
person
wouldn’t
be
in
custody
and
you
couldn’t
bring
suit.
now,
the
suggestion
--
again
i
might
say
that
that
--
at
that
court
should
reach
this
issue.
i
don’t
think
it
should
reach
it
without
full
briefing
because
the
issue
was
never
raised
below
and
hasn’t
been
--
hasn’t
frankly
been
brief
here.
now
the
suggestion
to
the
court
that
in
deciding
--
that
the
government
suggestion
to
the
court
in
deciding
the
question
of
the
validity
of
134,
this
court
should
not
be
misled
into
thinking
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
values
which
have
led
this
court
to
invalidate
vague
statutes
and
the
values
which
are
suggested
by
the
government.
now
turning
to
article
134,
i
think
the
significant
thing
about
article
134
is
that
it
has
always
been
recognized
to
be
broad
and
indefinite
and
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
all
the
historical
evidence
regarding
the
writers,
british
writers
going
back
to
the
1800s
and
the
american
military
writers
who
have
recognized
that
this
article
was
indefinite.
and
we
have
also
presented
testimony
of
congressional
hearings
in
1912,
1919,
1949
in
which
it
was
also
recognized
that
the
article
was
--
that
the
language
of
the
article
was
indefinite
and
the
government
doesn’t
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
because
your
honor
he
had
a
--
he
received
a
bad
conduct
discharge
your
honor.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
he
received
a
bad
conduct
discharge
taking
into
effect
two
convictions
because
following
this
conviction
your
honor.
he
was
convicted
i
believe
for
theft
of
a
camera,
your
honor.
so
taking
that,
the
military
took
both
of
them
into
account.
it’s
in
the
record,
specifically
to
both
into
account
and
giving
him
the
type
of
discharge
which
was
given
to
him.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i’ll
be
perfectly
honest
your
honor,
i
really
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
i
don’t
think
so,
if
we
win
--
well
if
we
win
on
this
perfectly
frankly,
i
will
go
back
and
attempt
to
get
to
his
type
of
discharge
here.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
am
not
prepared
at
this
time
to
talk
about
the
retroactivity
of
the
decision
your
honor.
it
would
only
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
i
think
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
that
i
believe
that
the
court
would
then
have
to
consider
the
type
of
situation
which
was
i
think
in
the
o’callahan
situation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
factors
which
were
involved
there
should
be
applied
to
allow
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
he
was
--
first
he
is
being
deprived
of
constitutional
right
here
too.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
think
so,
again
i
frankly
say
it’s
not
then
briefed,
i
am
really
not
very
familiar
with
the
cases
upon
that
this
court
decided
following
o’callahan
v.
parker
as
to
whether
or
not
who
could
come
in.
i
think
that
if
this
was
the
only
--
i’m
really
not
prepared
to
discuss
that,
your
honor
because
frankly
i
am
not
really
familiar
with
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
think
yes
and
i
think
if
your
honors
decide
the
issue
is
one
that
merits
full
consideration.
i
think
the
party
should
be
given
a
chance
to
brief
it
because
it
hasn’t
been
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
your
honor
i
realize
this
is
the
issue
and
i
am
only
urging
that
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
fully
agree
with
that
but
if
the
--
if
this
court
decides
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
really
an
important
one
in
all
collateral
attack,
i
really
think
that
it
should
be
briefed
fully
and
shouldn’t
be
done
just
on
this
record
and
frankly
on
cases
that
i
am
not
absolutely
and
completely
familiar
with
and
that
it
hasn’t
been
raised
below
ever.
now
the
government
really
doesn’t
seriously
challenge
the
historical
evidence
and
really
makes
no
effort
to
defend
the
language
itself.
and
grayned
v.
city
of
rockford
tells
us
that
statutes
such
as
this
are
vague
and
should
be
judged
on
their
face.
they
are
vague
because
they
offend
several
important
values.
one,
lack
of
fair
warning.
two,
lack
of
guidance
to
the
enforcing
authorities
leaving
them
with
uncontrolled
discretion
and
thirdly
where
statutes
affect
to
first
amendment
rights,
it
must
be
narrowly
drawn
to
save
this
from
the
vice
of
overbreadth.
and
a
statute
which
violates
anyone
of
these
values
should
be
struck
down.
now
the
government’s
principle
argument
regarding
a
projecting
is
that
the
court
shouldn’t
reach
the
statute
on
its
face.
and
the
government’s
position
apparently
is
that
if
avrech
was
aware
that
his
conduct
was
prohibited
by
article
134
that
ends
the
question
of
vagueness.
although,
we
don’t
concede
that
avrech
in
effect
had
fair
warning.
the
fallacy
of
the
government’s
argument
is
that
it
completely
ignores
the
second
value
which
is
a
lack
of
standards
to
guide
the
enforcing
authorities.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
you
cannot
leave
it
to
the
enforcing
authorities
to
determine
what
conduct
falls
within
a
statute.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
realize
that
i
was
--
i
didn’t
--
the
way
i
understood
i
didn’t
understand
that
he
would
concede
that
you
would
approach
it
on
its
face.
and
that
was
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
if
indeed
that
was
it,
i
gladly
accept
the
concession
that
the
court
should
have
reached
the
statute
on
its
face.
the
government
argues
then
that
if
the
court
reaches
the
statute
on
its
face
that
the
statute
is
not
invalid
and
it
sets
forth
several
reasons
both
in
its
brief
and
here
on
oral
argument
as
to
why
the
statute
is
not
invalid.
they
argue
in
the
brief
at
least
that
there’s
a
custom
in
practice
in
the
military
as
to
what
offenses
are
covered.
now
i
acknowledge
of
course
that
in
dynes
v.
hoover,
this
court
although
recognizing
the
apparent
in
the
terminus
of
the
article
held
that
there
was
a
custom
in
practice
in
the
military
as
to
what
offenses
are
covered.
well
i
suggest
to
you
that
what
this
court
did,
that
the
times
have
changed
since
dynes
v.
hoover.
dynes
v.
hoover
was
only
concerned
or
involved
itself
of
the
situation
where
there
was
a
small
professional
army.
now,
however
the
armies
have
obviously
changed
that
it
were
up
to
the
kind
of
this
conviction,
two
to
three
million
men
and
you
cannot
say
that
practical
men
in
the
navy
or
army
know
what
is
covered
by
this
article.
secondly,
the
history
of
the
article
has
certainly
changed
since
100
years
ago.
the
article
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
really
covers
a
growing
number
of
offenses.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
make
that
point
that
he
was
not
in
fact
aware.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
the
only
thing
that
he
said
your
honor
is
that,
“are
your
opinions
worth
risking
a
court-martial?
”and
that
we
urge
is
really
different
from
knowing
that
whether
or
not
your
conduct
is
covered
by
this
statute.
all
he
said
--
i
mean
i
think
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
but
he
has
to
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
think
he
has
to
know
something
more
than
that
his
views
are
going
to
be
displeasing
to
the
military.
and
even
if
he
did
have
fair
warning
which
again
as
i
say
he
didn’t.
that
doesn’t
meet
the
question
of
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
because
you
are
still
left
with
the
second
vice,
namely
the
failure
to
revive
guidance
for
enforcing
authorities.
moreover
the
government
--
if
you
are
looking
at
the
term
disloyalty
in
the
manual,
the
government
in
its
brief
freely
concedes
that
the
term
disloyalty
in
the
manual
is
vague
and
is
indefinite
and
you
cannot
tell
in
advance
the
government
states
in
his
brief
as
to
what
type
of
conduct
falls
within
the
manual's
definition
of
disloyalty.
now,
the
government
doesn’t
say
in
its
brief,
what
this
custom
in
practice
or
where
it
may
be
found.
and
it
suggests
that
perhaps
it
can
be
found
in
the
manual.
but
it
also
admits
that
the
manual
is
only
an
illustrative
guide
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
frequently
held
that
the
listing
of
an
offense
in
the
manual
doesn’t
mean
it’s
covered
by
article
134
and
it
is
also
held
that
the
failure
to
list
an
offense
in
the
manual
doesn’t
mean
that
it
is
not
covered.
so
the
manual
can
possibly
tell
you
what
is
custom
in
practice.
mr.
justice
clark
below
said
that
the
manual
is
only
a
mini
digest
of
the
roving
character
of
article
134.
now
the
government
suggests
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
because
--
well
first
i
would
argue
of
course
that
fair
warning
this
court
has
always
held
that
fair
warning
must
be
given
by
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
that
is
true
and
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
i
would
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
it
was
not
a
criminal
statute.
it
is
regulatory
statute
and
i
would
concede
i
think
after
i
say
--
the
argument
that
fair
warnings
be
given.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
would
say
that
if
there
was
a
specific
--
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
specifically
said
that
the
type
of
conduct
he
has
engaged
in
is
covered
by
article
134
then
i
would
have
to
concede
that
yes
indeed
he
did
that
very
well.
mr.
dorian
bowman
about
that
particular
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
dorian
bowman
if
that
is
the
case
but
that
is
not
the
case
here,
your
honor.
i
concede
that
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
said
that
this
particular
conduct
in
this
particular
circumstance
is
covered
by
the
statute
that
is
true
but
that
is
not
true
here.
mr.
dorian
bowman
that
is
quite
correct.
it
has
not
indeed
as
i
say,
it
has
stated
that
the
failure
to
list
an
offense
doesn’t
mean
that
it
cannot
be
covered
by
article
134.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes
but
the
court
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
it
has
affirmed
conviction
but
it
has
never
said
what
article
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
but
it
has
never
said
that
article
134
is
limited
to
that
conduct
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
in
that
particular
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes.
mr.
dorian
bowman
that
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
specifically
said,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
your
honor
but
it
doesn’t
done
that
with
respect
to
the
particular
conduct
that
we
are
involved
in
here.
now,
the
government
suggests
that
apart
from
what
the
manual
represents
as
a
repository
of
custom
in
practice
that
the
manual
gives
fair
warning.
now
the
inadequacy
of
this
is
as
i
have
shown
with
regard
to
custom
in
practice
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
frequently
held
that
offenses
which
are
not
covered
can
still
be
charged
under
134.
in
addition,
new
offenses
are
added
every
single
time
you
have
new
additions
of
the
manual.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
disloyalty
provision
here
was
added
in
1951
after
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
was
enacted
and
you
cannot
say
here
that
there
was
any
considered
legislative
judgment
that
this
particular
type
of
conduct
should
be
covered.
now,
the
government’s
principal
argument
i
think
really
goes
to
the
question
of
what
the
constitutional
rules
of
vagueness
which
we
have
been
discussing
had
any
application
to
the
military.
and
the
government
must
offer
some
justification
why
the
rules
for
the
military
should
be
different
and
it’s
not
enough
to
say
just
that
the
military
is
involved.
this
court
has
always
taken
the
approach
that
the
party
who
wishes
to
relax
constitutional
principles
must
have
the
burden
of
showing
why
those
principles
should
not
apply
in
a
particular
situation.
and
this
court
indicated
in
frontiero
and
toth
v.
quarles
that
this
rule
certainly
applies
to
the
military.
and
the
highest
military
courts
in
jacoby
and
tentia
(ph)
and
the
lower
federal
court
have
taken
that
approach
as
well
as
the
two
circuit
courts
here.
and
there
are
compelling
reasons
i
think
why
the
constitutional
standards
of
vagueness
should
apply
to
the
military.
in
the
first
case,
we
have
people
in
the
military
who
are
draftees
or
volunteers
who
live
their
civilian
life
for
at
least
a
period
of
two
years.
they
give
up
their
civilian
life.
they
make
sacrifices
and
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
why
with
regard
to
knowledge,
why
they
should
not
have
the
same
protections
with
regard
to
statutes
that
civilians
have.
furthermore,
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
is
a
penal
statute.
it’s
a
penal
statute
and
it
is
no
different
from
any
other
civilian
penal
statute.
it
imposes
penalties,
people
can
go
to
jail
for
this
and
there
is
no
reason
why
different
standard
should
apply.
and
the
government
offers
nothing
here
really
than
code
words
and
slogan
such
as
military
necessity
and
instead
of
any
analysis
of
the
issue.
now
i
admit
that
it
may
be
convenient
for
the
military
to
have
a
vague
and
overbroad
statute.
indeed
all
enforcing
authorities
i
am
sure
have
come
and
would
find
it
convenient
to
have
such
a
broad
statute.
to
have
an
open-ended
statute
but
that
is
precisely
why
this
court
has
struck
down
such
statutes
because
you
can’t
give
enforcing
authorities
wide
and
uncontrolled
discretion.
now
there
are
indeed
with
regard
to
solicitor
general’s
argument
that
the
military
needs
article
134,
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
at
least
several
military
man
who
don’t
agree
with
that,
who
say
that
we
can
get
by
without
article
134.
and
chief
judge,
the
army
board
of
review,
general
hodson
said
that
and
the
secretary
of
defense
own
task
force
on
the
administration
of
justice
recommend
that
article
i
which
included
by
the
way
the
judge
advocate
generals
recommended
that
article
134
be
abolished.
and
i
suggest
for
any
conduct
that
the
military
doesn’t
like,
they
have
a
very
simple
solution
and
that’s
to
go
to
congress
and
enact
specific
punitive
articles.
they
have
done
this
before
and
uniform
code
of
military
justice
was
adopted
in
1949.
there
was
certain
conduct
covered
by
article
134
which
was
--
which
were
made
into
specific
punitive
articles.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
i
presume
you
would
run
--
i
presume
--
i
think
you
could
draw
a
statute.
i
frankly
haven’t
thought
of
the
word
which
would
prohibit
all
--
which
prohibit
the
--
let’s
say
the
publication
of
any
statement
which
let’s
say
draws
into
question
of
governmental
policy.
i
think
you
would
then
of
course
run
into
the
first
amendment.
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
frankly,
i
would
be
perfectly
honest,
your
honor
i
can’t.
i
have
not
thought
about
a
statute
sufficiently
to
draw
it
up
just
without
thinking
about
it.
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
i
am
saying
that
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no.
if
there
is
a
particular
conduct
which
the
army
doesn’t
like,
they
should
go
and
enact
specific
articles.
i
am
not
prepared
this
time
to
draft
the
statute
right
now
as
what
could
be
covered.
i
think
that
you
could
draft
a
statute;
you
might
of
course
in
this
particular
context
run
into
first
amendment
question
as
to
whether
they
could
validly
pass
a
statute.
with
whether
such
i
would
withstand
this
court
scrutiny
but
frankly,
your
honor
i
am
not
prepared
to
this
time
draft
the
statute
which
might
cover
this
activity.
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
your
honor
i
take
issue
with
that.
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
think
that’s
true
and
i
think
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
that
is
certainly
true
your
honor
but
it
is
certainly
no
indication
if
you
look
at
the
statute
at
the
manual
as
to
what
you
can
or
cannot
do.
obviously
when
you
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
yes,
i
agree
that
it
is
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
i
think
you
begin
to
understand
that
anything
you
do
which
the
commanding
officer
might
not
like,
you
do
risk
punishment
under
article
134.
i
admit
that
the
freedom
of
speech
is
less.
that
does
not
mean
and
i
won’t
go
into
it
now,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
the
test
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well,
that’s
true
but
article
134
does
stand
in
this
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
oh!
i
have
heard
about
kp
your
honor.
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
i
believe
suggested
to
the
solicitor
general,
if
the
military
could
easily
have
given
an
order
or
your
honor
did
and
order
not
to
do
what
he
did.
it
was
very
simple.
now
in
the
few
moments
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
well
i
think
it
would
certainly
have
taken
care
of
this
problem,
would
probably
take
care
of
a
lot
of
problems
in
the
military.
yes
if
you
--
mr.
dorian
bowman
no,
i
don’t
think,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
the
way
that
cover
this
type
of
conduct
is
to
enact
specific
punitive
articles.
in
the
few
moments
remaining,
i
would
just
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
overbreadth.
article
134,
the
government
concedes
at
least
in
its
brief
reaches
first
amendment
--
reaches
first
amendment
activities
and
the
court
has
struck
down
statutes
and
if
government
concedes
that
the
court
has
struck
down
statutes
on
their
face
it
would
reach
first
amendment
activities.
the
government’s
point
here
is
that
since
article
134
covers
conduct
outside
of
the
first
amendment
as
well
as
within
the
first
amendment,
this
court
should
not
consider
the
statute
on
its
face.
now
the
government
cites
no
case
for
that
proposition.
frankly,
i
know
of
no
case
holding
that
because
a
statute
can
cover
all
types
of
conduct,
it
should
be
held
overbroad
because
it
impinges
on
the
first
amendment.
this
statute
because
it
is
all
embraced
it
covers
a
whole
variety
of
activity
including
first
amendment
activities
and
is
therefore
overbroad
and
should
be
struck
down.
thank
you.
