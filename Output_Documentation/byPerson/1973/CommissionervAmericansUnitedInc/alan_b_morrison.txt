mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
americans
united
is
before
this
court
today
largely
because
the
decisions
made
by
the
internal
revenue
service,
relating
to
the
administration
of
the
internal
revenue
codes'
provisions
regarding
charities.
the
service
has
decided
to
administer
these
provisions
by
a
system
of
advanced
rulings.
this
system
is
unique
to
the
internal
revenue
service
under
the
charitable
area
and
does
not
apply
with
near
the
force
in
this
area
as
it
does
in
other
areas
where
rulings
are
issued.
the
result
of
this
decision
by
the
service
is
that
a
ruling
that
an
organization
is
tax
exempt
is
not
merely
useful,
but
it’s
essential.
the
ruling
has
become
the
sine
qua
non
of
effective
fundraising
for
charitable
organization
and
the
denial
of
a
ruling
or
the
revocation
of
a
ruling
requires
immediate
action
on
behalf
of
the
charity
if
it
is
to
continue
without
serious
financial
difficulties.
as
mr.
crampton
explained,
there
are
two
aspects
of
a
charitable
ruling.
first,
that
the
charity
is
exempt
from
income
taxation.
this
is
relatively
unimportant
for
the
small
organizations,
but
to
a
large
university
with
a
significant
endowment,
the
exemption
from
income
taxation
can
be
important.
but
the
second
feature
and
by
far
the
more
important
because
it
is
essential
to
all
kinds
of
charities,
is
that
donations
are
deductible
from
the
income
of
the
donor
and
particularly
from
the
income
tax
of
the
donor
with
a
large
income.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
organization
qualifies
under
section
501
(c)
(3)
is
ultimately
one
for
the
courts
to
decide
under
the
test
laid
down
by
the
congress.
now,
the
service
could
have
decided
to
administer
these
provisions
without
a
system
of
advanced
rulings.
income
tax
matters
would
be
handled
like
other
income
tax
matters.
deductions
could
have
depended
upon
opinions
of
counsel
for
either
the
charity
or
for
the
donor.
but
the
service
decided
long
ago
that
a
system
of
issuing
advance
rulings
would
be
useful
both
to
the
service
and
to
the
taxpayers
to
let
everyone
know
where
they
stand
and
they
have
been
issuing
these
rulings
for
years.
in
fact,
in
1969
in
the
tax
reform
act,
the
congress
enacted
a
new
section,
section
508
which
requires
any
organization
seeking
a
501
(c)
(3)
status
to
notify
the
service
in
advance
that
they
are
going
to
claim
that
they
are
exempt,
so
the
service
can
begin
considering
the
question.
in
addition
to
the
issuance
of
rulings,
the
service
has
also
prepared
a
document
known
as
the
cumulative
list
of
exempt
organizations.
once
an
organization
has
a
ruling
that
it
is
exempt
under
501
(c)
(3),
it’s
name
is
added
to
the
list
and
the
service
no
longer
can
challenge
the
deductibility
of
gifts
added
to
that
for
an
organization
on
that
list.
if
the
organization
is
not
on
that
list,
it
creates
enormous
fundraising
problems
particularly
with
regard
to
the
large
donors
for
there
are
after
all
a
limited
number
of
funds
available.
and
the
absence
of
the
name
of
an
organization
from
that
list
puts
that
organization
at
a
serious
competitive
disadvantage
in
seeking
to
attract
funds.
in
effect,
the
ruling
is
a
license
that
operates
seriously
in
the
fundraising
areas.
as
the
courts
below,
the
court
below
here,
the
court
in
bob
jones
and
as
former
commissioner
thrower
indicated
these
are
very
serious
matters.
and
thus,
when
americans
united
had
its
501
(c)
(3)
status
revoked
in
1969,
it
caused
serious
financial
problems.
now,
it
was
still
and
is
today
still
exempt
from
income
taxation
under
501
(c)
(4).
therefore,
it
pays
no
income
taxes.
it
can’t
go
to
the
tax
court
to
seek
a
claim
for
refund
on
the
income
taxes.
the
only
other
tax
consequence
to
americans
united
itself
as
a
result
of
the
ruling
revocation
was
a
requirement
that
it
begin
to
pay
unemployment
taxes
commonly
referred
to
as
futa
which
in
the
four
years
between
the
revocation
and
today
has
never
amounted
to
more
than
$1,200,
a
really
trifling
amount
when
considered
in
the
light
of
the
real
consequences
which
is
the
lost
contributions.
in
fact,
these
futa
taxes
are
so
small
that
americans
united
has
paid
those
taxes
and
will
continue
to
pay
those
taxes
through
the
end
of
this
case
however,
long
it
takes
but
that’s
not
really
what
we’re
concerned
about
here.
the
prayer
for
relief
specifically
says,
the
complaint
specifically
says
we
are
not
seeking
to
enjoin
any
taxes
payable
by
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i’m
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
could
do
that
your
honor.
i
mean
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
it
could
have
been
done.
first,
let
me
say,
the
notion
that
we
could
raise
this
was
not
suggested
by
anyone
until
the
reply
brief
states
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
refund
suit
could
have
been
brought
your
honor,
but
it
is
fraught
with
difficulties.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
legal
issue
is
in
most
cases
the
same
as
the
deductibility
issue,
in
most
cases
i
say,
but
it
is
the
remedy
which
is
uncertain
albeit
not
for
americans
united
perhaps
but
for
a
number
of
other
organizations
which
are
in
the
very
similar
position.
first,
because
your
honor,
there
are
exemptions
from
futa
tax.
it
does
not
apply
to
any
organization
which
does
not
have
$1,500
a
year
in
wages
paid.
there
are
others
exemptions
for
small
organizations.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
we
first
say,
your
honor,
that
we’re
asking
this
court
to
establish
an
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act
to
construe
it
as
non-applicable
in
a
series
of
cases
and
we
believe
it
would
be
counterproductive
for
the
court
to
establish
rules
depending
upon
the
peculiarities
of
or
otherwise
very
similar
organizations.
but
moreover,
beyond
that
your
honor,
our
real
problem
is
not
whether
the
remedy
is
available,
but
whether
the
remedy
is
available,
but
whether
the
remedy
is
truly
adequate.
for
the
refund
suit
biggest
problem
as
is
the
suit
by
a
donor
is
that
it
does
nothing
to
stop
the
service
in
continuing
the
position
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
in
1876,
this
court
in
the
state
railroad
tax
cases
referred
to
the
anti-injunction
action
act
in
connection
with
the
refund
provisions
as
a
complete
system
of
corrective
justice.
and
in
those
days
where
the
only
questions
involved
were
the
questions
of,
would
the
taxpayer
get
back
the
taxes
plus
interest
that
he
paid,
it
was
a
complete
system.
and
as
in
williams
packing
it
was
a
complete
system
of
corrective
justice
where
the
only
thing,
anybody
was
seeking
a
refund
of
is
the
taxes
that
were
paid.
those
taxes
in
this
case
are
irrelevant.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
did
place
great
emphasis
on
--
upon
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
was
before
it,
your
honor
and
it
was
dismissed
in
the
footnote
as
being
so
far
from
the
mainstream
of
the
litigation
as
not
to
be
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
believe
americans
united
probably
could
have
on
the
assumption
that
first
it
was
not
mooted
out
and
we
take
a
different
view
of
the
scientology
case.
we
don’t
think
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
was
put
in
very
briefly
by
the
government
in
the
second
reply
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
the
court
of
appeals.
yes,
your
honor.
but
not
in
the
district
court
and
that
was
some
three-and-a-half
years
after
the
ruling
was
revoked.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
believe
they
did,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
believe,
there’s
also
a
possibility,
i’m
not
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
record
but
as
i
read
the
government’s
brief,
it’s
alleged
that
bob
jones
may
have
some
income
tax
liability
since
it
was
held
not
to
be
a
c-4
organization
as
was
our
organization.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
if
that’s
what
i
said
it
wasn’t
precisely
what
i
meant.
although
the
anti-injunction
statute
is
absolute
on
its
face
with
certain
specific
exceptions
largely
relating
to
the
tax
court
proceedings
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
same
way
that
this
court
has
been
doing
it
for
50
years
without
rewriting
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
to
begin
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
standard
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
standard
nut
margarine
case,
lipke
versus
lederer,
hill
versus
wallace,
and
the
case
we
rely
upon
most
allen
against
the
regents
of
georgia
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
want
you
to
say,
your
honor
that
it
is
the
outside
the
purposes
of
the
anti-injunction
action
since
as
your
honor
quite
correctly
pointed
out
earlier,
congress
obviously
did
not
have
charitable
organizations
in
mind
in
1867
when
it
wrote
this
provision.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
sir,
your
honor.
it
didn’t
have
a
great
many
things
in
mind.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
it
does
have
quite
an
impact.
for
in
our
view,
most
donors
and
particularly
large
donors
who
are
considering
making
a
sizable
gift
to
a
charitable
organization,
if
the
organization
is
not
on
the
list
as
americans
united
has
not
been.
most
of
these
or
many
of
these
persons
will
simply
deflect
the
contribution
to
another
organization
which
is
on
the
list.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
it
is
important
because
we
think
it’s
indicative
of
fact
that
this
case
is
not
dealing
primarily
with
the
orderly
process
of
the
collection
of
revenue
as
has
been
true
in
other
cases.
and
as
the
government’s
brief
says,
and
as
the
supreme
court
has
said
in
enochs,
the
manifest
purpose
is
to
ensure
the
orderly
process
of
the
collection
of
revenue.
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
far
from
the
mainstream
of
that
kind
of
problem.
and
its
particularly
important
because
of
the
great
need
that
this
taxpayer
has
to
have
his
ruling
of
equal
importance
is
the
fact
that
not
only
does
it
not
have
its
ruling
during
this
period
of
time,
but
that
throughout
the
entire
period
of
the
refund
litigation,
there
will
be
no
revenue
coming
in
because
of
the
laws
of
the
ruling.
and
this
is
important
because
even
if
we
win
the
refund
suit
at
the
district
court
level
after
having
waited
until
the
end
of
the
year
so
that
an
annual
tax
could
be
paid,
waited
to
file
a
claim
for
refund,
waiting
six
months
after
that,
thereafter
filing
the
complaint,
the
government
answering
60
days
later,
discovery
beginning
and
perhaps
the
government
discovering
an
issue
in
the
case
that
will
enable
it
to
prevail
for
reasons
other
than
the
reason
that
was
given
for
the
denial
of
deduction.
after
that
happens
and
even
if
we
win
the
case
in
the
district
court,
the
ruling
does
not
come
back
yet
for
according
to
the
government’s
theory
that
even
where
the
refund
suit
is
won,
there
is
still
no
right
to
have
the
ruling
restored.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
view
that
as
co-terminus,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
enacted
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
does
seem
broader
your
honor,
but
it
was
enacted
specifically
to
fill
a
loophole
that
had
been
created
that
some
of
the
courts
have
started
to
permit
declaratory
judgments
to
do
that
which
the
anti-injunction
act
could
not
do
and
it
was
intended
specifically
for
that
purpose
and
with
no
other
purpose
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
would
be
very
much
broader.
i
would
point
out
your
honor
that
section
1340
the
jurisdictional
section
uses
the
phrase
giving
the
district
court’s
jurisdiction
to
matters
arising
under
the
tax
law
which
might
even
seem
broader.
but
i
think
that
all
of
the
courts
have
considered
them
to
be
in
the
same
general
area.
it
was
enacted,
that
is
the
exception
to
declaratory
judgment
act
was
enacted
to
fill
a
specific
need
to
prevent
the
end
run,
if
you
will,
around
the
--
in
the
anti-injunction
action
and
therefore
we
consider
it
to
be
the
same.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
not
in
this
court.
no,
your
honor.
there
are
certain
cases
referred
to
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that’s
right
your
honor.
we
have
--
the
legislative
history,
we
quote,
i
believe
it’s
in
footnote
in
our
brief.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
footnote
6
--
footnote
5
on
page
6,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
it
makes
references
to
judge
thame's
discussion
of
the
legislative
history
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
that
it
does
indicate
that
that
is
the
case.
as
i
said,
the
real
loss
to
americans
united
in
this
case
is
the
lost
contributions
and
the
refunding
of
$1,200
plus
interest
is
not
going
to
do
anything
about
getting
that
back.
and
we
think
that
this
case
comes
within
this
court’s
exception
in
allen
against
the
regents
where
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
was,
like
this
case,
not
the
taxpayer,
that
is
not
the
person
against
whom
the
taxes
were
sought
to
be
collected.
and
that
--
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
where
the
plaintiff
had
no
plain
speedy
and
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“adequate”
because
that
is
in
our
view
the
touchstone
here,
that
the
remedy
suggested
by
the
government
is
not
adequate.
but
the
court
had
jurisdiction
not
withstanding
the
literal
language
of
the
anti-injunction
act.
we
believe
that
that
case
applies
here.
the
government
contends
that
allen
was
overruled
in
effect
by
williams
packing
company.
that
williams
packing
is
a
substitute
for
a
whole
long
line
of
cases
which
are
not
discussed
at
all
and
which
the
allen
decision
is
indicated
only
as
a
see
also
footnote.
the
decisions
in
allen
and
williams
packing
are
irreconcilable
for
one
very
important
reason.
the
williams
packing
decision
predicates
jurisdiction
upon
a
finding
that
under
no
view
of
the
facts
or
law
could
the
government
prevail,
but
in
allen,
not
only
could
the
government
not
prevail
but
in
the
very
same
opinion,
this
court
upheld
the
determination
that
the
statute
challenged
by
the
university
of
georgia
regents
was
constitutional.
therefore,
the
decisions
are
irreconcilable
and
the
government
must
contend
that
allen
was
overruled.
we
see
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
court
overruled
allen.
the
cases
are
different.
the
facts
are
different
and
we
suggest
that
the
decision
in
allen
against
the
regents
is
still
good
law
and
supports
this
case
as
do
other
cases
such
as
lipke
against
lederer,
which
dealt
primarily
with
the
problem
of
a
penalty
being
imposed
in
the
form
of
a
tax,
or
cases
involving
essentially
regulatory
matters,
hill
against
wallace.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
say
that
they
are
irreconcilable
if
the
government
statement
that
there
is
a
substitute
that
enochs
was
a
substitute
for
all
of
the
prior
decisions.
it
becomes
irreconcilable,
but
i
view
that
there
are
--
they
really
deal
with
two
different
kinds
of
exceptions.
there
are,
if
you
will,
parallel
different
classes
of
exceptions
and
that
the
allen
case
supports
the
decision
we’re
asking
this
court
to
affirm
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
we
believe.
i
misspoke
perhaps,
that
they
are
irreconcilable
only
if
you
accept
the
government’s
proposition
that
won
this
a
substitute
for
the
other.
we
believe
they
are
not
irreconcilable
and
that
they
simply
dealt
with
different
situation.
the
williams
packing
case
being
the
classic
case
of
a
taxpayer
seeking
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
its
own
taxes
claiming
verifiably
or
not
that
there
was
irreparable
harm.
this
court
said,
no,
in
that
situation,
irreparable
harm
and
the
adequacy
of
remedy
is
not
enough.
you
must
show
more
and
that’s
what
7421
says
and
we
agree
100%,
but
we
don’t
think
that
deals
with
this
case
where
there
are
different
problems
involved
than
in
that
situation.
all
that
we
are
seeking
here
is
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
question
of
whether
or
not
our
ruling
was
properly
revoked
during
the
course
of
the
litigation.
all
we
want
is
a
chance
to
obtain
an
injunction
so
that
we
will
not
have
to
wait
years
until
the
refund
suit
is
concluded.
we
are
not
as
the
government
suggests
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
38,
asking
for
an
automatic
right
to
retain
the
ruling
regardless
of
the
merits.
we
are
fully
aware
of
the
standards
both
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage
and
what
we
must
do
with
the
merits
in
order
to
retain
the
ruling
which
we
have
been
without
for
almost
four
years
now.
but
at
least,
it’s
a
chance
and
it’s
a
chance
for
organization
such
as
this,
an
equally
important
for
fledgling
organizations
which
have
no
financial
backing
to
rely
against
--
to
rely
on.
just
recently,
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
case
of
center
on
corporate
responsibility
against
schultz,
a
decision
which
the
government
referred
to
in
its
initial
brief
in
this
case,
but
did
not
refer
to
in
its
most
recent
brief,
an
unreported
decision,
but
now
appears
in
the
1974
cch
reporter
at
paragraph
9118,
where
this
court
or
that
court
upheld
the
plaintiff
and
held
that
the
service
had
illegally
ruled
that
it
was
not
entitled
to
a
deduction.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
that
very
case,
the
service
contended
that
in
spite
of
the
allegations
of
political
influence
and
no
basis
at
all
for
denying
the
deduction,
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
and
we
submit
that
7421
was
not
intended
to
apply
in
those
situations,
that
it
was
not
intended
to
act
where
there
was
no
complete
system
of
corrective
justice.
we
see
no
reason
to
this
to
apply
the
statute
which
was
obviously
not
intended
to
reach
charitable
organizations
and
there’s
every
reason
and
not
to
apply
it.
accordingly,
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
americans
united
is
before
this
court
today
largely
because
the
decisions
made
by
the
internal
revenue
service,
relating
to
the
administration
of
the
internal
revenue
codes'
provisions
regarding
charities.
the
service
has
decided
to
administer
these
provisions
by
a
system
of
advanced
rulings.
this
system
is
unique
to
the
internal
revenue
service
under
the
charitable
area
and
does
not
apply
with
near
the
force
in
this
area
as
it
does
in
other
areas
where
rulings
are
issued.
the
result
of
this
decision
by
the
service
is
that
a
ruling
that
an
organization
is
tax
exempt
is
not
merely
useful,
but
it’s
essential.
the
ruling
has
become
the
sine
qua
non
of
effective
fundraising
for
charitable
organization
and
the
denial
of
a
ruling
or
the
revocation
of
a
ruling
requires
immediate
action
on
behalf
of
the
charity
if
it
is
to
continue
without
serious
financial
difficulties.
as
mr.
crampton
explained,
there
are
two
aspects
of
a
charitable
ruling.
first,
that
the
charity
is
exempt
from
income
taxation.
this
is
relatively
unimportant
for
the
small
organizations,
but
to
a
large
university
with
a
significant
endowment,
the
exemption
from
income
taxation
can
be
important.
but
the
second
feature
and
by
far
the
more
important
because
it
is
essential
to
all
kinds
of
charities,
is
that
donations
are
deductible
from
the
income
of
the
donor
and
particularly
from
the
income
tax
of
the
donor
with
a
large
income.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
organization
qualifies
under
section
501
(c)
(3)
is
ultimately
one
for
the
courts
to
decide
under
the
test
laid
down
by
the
congress.
now,
the
service
could
have
decided
to
administer
these
provisions
without
a
system
of
advanced
rulings.
income
tax
matters
would
be
handled
like
other
income
tax
matters.
deductions
could
have
depended
upon
opinions
of
counsel
for
either
the
charity
or
for
the
donor.
but
the
service
decided
long
ago
that
a
system
of
issuing
advance
rulings
would
be
useful
both
to
the
service
and
to
the
taxpayers
to
let
everyone
know
where
they
stand
and
they
have
been
issuing
these
rulings
for
years.
in
fact,
in
1969
in
the
tax
reform
act,
the
congress
enacted
a
new
section,
section
508
which
requires
any
organization
seeking
a
501
(c)
(3)
status
to
notify
the
service
in
advance
that
they
are
going
to
claim
that
they
are
exempt,
so
the
service
can
begin
considering
the
question.
in
addition
to
the
issuance
of
rulings,
the
service
has
also
prepared
a
document
known
as
the
cumulative
list
of
exempt
organizations.
once
an
organization
has
a
ruling
that
it
is
exempt
under
501
(c)
(3),
it’s
name
is
added
to
the
list
and
the
service
no
longer
can
challenge
the
deductibility
of
gifts
added
to
that
for
an
organization
on
that
list.
if
the
organization
is
not
on
that
list,
it
creates
enormous
fundraising
problems
particularly
with
regard
to
the
large
donors
for
there
are
after
all
a
limited
number
of
funds
available.
and
the
absence
of
the
name
of
an
organization
from
that
list
puts
that
organization
at
a
serious
competitive
disadvantage
in
seeking
to
attract
funds.
in
effect,
the
ruling
is
a
license
that
operates
seriously
in
the
fundraising
areas.
as
the
courts
below,
the
court
below
here,
the
court
in
bob
jones
and
as
former
commissioner
thrower
indicated
these
are
very
serious
matters.
and
thus,
when
americans
united
had
its
501
(c)
(3)
status
revoked
in
1969,
it
caused
serious
financial
problems.
now,
it
was
still
and
is
today
still
exempt
from
income
taxation
under
501
(c)
(4).
therefore,
it
pays
no
income
taxes.
it
can’t
go
to
the
tax
court
to
seek
a
claim
for
refund
on
the
income
taxes.
the
only
other
tax
consequence
to
americans
united
itself
as
a
result
of
the
ruling
revocation
was
a
requirement
that
it
begin
to
pay
unemployment
taxes
commonly
referred
to
as
futa
which
in
the
four
years
between
the
revocation
and
today
has
never
amounted
to
more
than
$1,200,
a
really
trifling
amount
when
considered
in
the
light
of
the
real
consequences
which
is
the
lost
contributions.
in
fact,
these
futa
taxes
are
so
small
that
americans
united
has
paid
those
taxes
and
will
continue
to
pay
those
taxes
through
the
end
of
this
case
however,
long
it
takes
but
that’s
not
really
what
we’re
concerned
about
here.
the
prayer
for
relief
specifically
says,
the
complaint
specifically
says
we
are
not
seeking
to
enjoin
any
taxes
payable
by
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i’m
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
could
do
that
your
honor.
i
mean
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
it
could
have
been
done.
first,
let
me
say,
the
notion
that
we
could
raise
this
was
not
suggested
by
anyone
until
the
reply
brief
states
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
refund
suit
could
have
been
brought
your
honor,
but
it
is
fraught
with
difficulties.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
legal
issue
is
in
most
cases
the
same
as
the
deductibility
issue,
in
most
cases
i
say,
but
it
is
the
remedy
which
is
uncertain
albeit
not
for
americans
united
perhaps
but
for
a
number
of
other
organizations
which
are
in
the
very
similar
position.
first,
because
your
honor,
there
are
exemptions
from
futa
tax.
it
does
not
apply
to
any
organization
which
does
not
have
$1,500
a
year
in
wages
paid.
there
are
others
exemptions
for
small
organizations.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
we
first
say,
your
honor,
that
we’re
asking
this
court
to
establish
an
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act
to
construe
it
as
non-applicable
in
a
series
of
cases
and
we
believe
it
would
be
counterproductive
for
the
court
to
establish
rules
depending
upon
the
peculiarities
of
or
otherwise
very
similar
organizations.
but
moreover,
beyond
that
your
honor,
our
real
problem
is
not
whether
the
remedy
is
available,
but
whether
the
remedy
is
available,
but
whether
the
remedy
is
truly
adequate.
for
the
refund
suit
biggest
problem
as
is
the
suit
by
a
donor
is
that
it
does
nothing
to
stop
the
service
in
continuing
the
position
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
in
1876,
this
court
in
the
state
railroad
tax
cases
referred
to
the
anti-injunction
action
act
in
connection
with
the
refund
provisions
as
a
complete
system
of
corrective
justice.
and
in
those
days
where
the
only
questions
involved
were
the
questions
of,
would
the
taxpayer
get
back
the
taxes
plus
interest
that
he
paid,
it
was
a
complete
system.
and
as
in
williams
packing
it
was
a
complete
system
of
corrective
justice
where
the
only
thing,
anybody
was
seeking
a
refund
of
is
the
taxes
that
were
paid.
those
taxes
in
this
case
are
irrelevant.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
did
place
great
emphasis
on
--
upon
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
was
before
it,
your
honor
and
it
was
dismissed
in
the
footnote
as
being
so
far
from
the
mainstream
of
the
litigation
as
not
to
be
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
believe
americans
united
probably
could
have
on
the
assumption
that
first
it
was
not
mooted
out
and
we
take
a
different
view
of
the
scientology
case.
we
don’t
think
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
was
put
in
very
briefly
by
the
government
in
the
second
reply
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
the
court
of
appeals.
yes,
your
honor.
but
not
in
the
district
court
and
that
was
some
three-and-a-half
years
after
the
ruling
was
revoked.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
believe
they
did,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
believe,
there’s
also
a
possibility,
i’m
not
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
record
but
as
i
read
the
government’s
brief,
it’s
alleged
that
bob
jones
may
have
some
income
tax
liability
since
it
was
held
not
to
be
a
c-4
organization
as
was
our
organization.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
if
that’s
what
i
said
it
wasn’t
precisely
what
i
meant.
although
the
anti-injunction
statute
is
absolute
on
its
face
with
certain
specific
exceptions
largely
relating
to
the
tax
court
proceedings
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
same
way
that
this
court
has
been
doing
it
for
50
years
without
rewriting
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
to
begin
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
standard
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
standard
nut
margarine
case,
lipke
versus
lederer,
hill
versus
wallace,
and
the
case
we
rely
upon
most
allen
against
the
regents
of
georgia
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
want
you
to
say,
your
honor
that
it
is
the
outside
the
purposes
of
the
anti-injunction
action
since
as
your
honor
quite
correctly
pointed
out
earlier,
congress
obviously
did
not
have
charitable
organizations
in
mind
in
1867
when
it
wrote
this
provision.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
sir,
your
honor.
it
didn’t
have
a
great
many
things
in
mind.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
it
does
have
quite
an
impact.
for
in
our
view,
most
donors
and
particularly
large
donors
who
are
considering
making
a
sizable
gift
to
a
charitable
organization,
if
the
organization
is
not
on
the
list
as
americans
united
has
not
been.
most
of
these
or
many
of
these
persons
will
simply
deflect
the
contribution
to
another
organization
which
is
on
the
list.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
it
is
important
because
we
think
it’s
indicative
of
fact
that
this
case
is
not
dealing
primarily
with
the
orderly
process
of
the
collection
of
revenue
as
has
been
true
in
other
cases.
and
as
the
government’s
brief
says,
and
as
the
supreme
court
has
said
in
enochs,
the
manifest
purpose
is
to
ensure
the
orderly
process
of
the
collection
of
revenue.
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
far
from
the
mainstream
of
that
kind
of
problem.
and
its
particularly
important
because
of
the
great
need
that
this
taxpayer
has
to
have
his
ruling
of
equal
importance
is
the
fact
that
not
only
does
it
not
have
its
ruling
during
this
period
of
time,
but
that
throughout
the
entire
period
of
the
refund
litigation,
there
will
be
no
revenue
coming
in
because
of
the
laws
of
the
ruling.
and
this
is
important
because
even
if
we
win
the
refund
suit
at
the
district
court
level
after
having
waited
until
the
end
of
the
year
so
that
an
annual
tax
could
be
paid,
waited
to
file
a
claim
for
refund,
waiting
six
months
after
that,
thereafter
filing
the
complaint,
the
government
answering
60
days
later,
discovery
beginning
and
perhaps
the
government
discovering
an
issue
in
the
case
that
will
enable
it
to
prevail
for
reasons
other
than
the
reason
that
was
given
for
the
denial
of
deduction.
after
that
happens
and
even
if
we
win
the
case
in
the
district
court,
the
ruling
does
not
come
back
yet
for
according
to
the
government’s
theory
that
even
where
the
refund
suit
is
won,
there
is
still
no
right
to
have
the
ruling
restored.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
view
that
as
co-terminus,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
enacted
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
does
seem
broader
your
honor,
but
it
was
enacted
specifically
to
fill
a
loophole
that
had
been
created
that
some
of
the
courts
have
started
to
permit
declaratory
judgments
to
do
that
which
the
anti-injunction
act
could
not
do
and
it
was
intended
specifically
for
that
purpose
and
with
no
other
purpose
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
would
be
very
much
broader.
i
would
point
out
your
honor
that
section
1340
the
jurisdictional
section
uses
the
phrase
giving
the
district
court’s
jurisdiction
to
matters
arising
under
the
tax
law
which
might
even
seem
broader.
but
i
think
that
all
of
the
courts
have
considered
them
to
be
in
the
same
general
area.
it
was
enacted,
that
is
the
exception
to
declaratory
judgment
act
was
enacted
to
fill
a
specific
need
to
prevent
the
end
run,
if
you
will,
around
the
--
in
the
anti-injunction
action
and
therefore
we
consider
it
to
be
the
same.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
not
in
this
court.
no,
your
honor.
there
are
certain
cases
referred
to
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that’s
right
your
honor.
we
have
--
the
legislative
history,
we
quote,
i
believe

on

your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
it
makes
references
to
judge
thame's
discussion
of
the
legislative
history
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
that
it
does
indicate
that
that
is
the
case.
as
i
said,
the
real
loss
to
americans
united
in
this
case
is
the
lost
contributions
and
the
refunding
of
$1,200
plus
interest
is
not
going
to
do
anything
about
getting
that
back.
and
we
think
that
this
case
comes
within
this
court’s
exception
in
allen
against
the
regents
where
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
was,
like
this
case,
not
the
taxpayer,
that
is
not
the
person
against
whom
the
taxes
were
sought
to
be
collected.
and
that
--
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
where
the
plaintiff
had
no
plain
speedy
and
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“adequate”
because
that
is
in
our
view
the
touchstone
here,
that
the
remedy
suggested
by
the
government
is
not
adequate.
but
the
court
had
jurisdiction
not
withstanding
the
literal
language
of
the
anti-injunction
act.
we
believe
that
that
case
applies
here.
the
government
contends
that
allen
was
overruled
in
effect
by
williams
packing
company.
that
williams
packing
is
a
substitute
for
a
whole
long
line
of
cases
which
are
not
discussed
at
all
and
which
the
allen
decision
is
indicated
only
as
a
see
also
footnote.
the
decisions
in
allen
and
williams
packing
are
irreconcilable
for
one
very
important
reason.
the
williams
packing
decision
predicates
jurisdiction
upon
a
finding
that
under
no
view
of
the
facts
or
law
could
the
government
prevail,
but
in
allen,
not
only
could
the
government
not
prevail
but
in
the
very
same
opinion,
this
court
upheld
the
determination
that
the
statute
challenged
by
the
university
of
georgia
regents
was
constitutional.
therefore,
the
decisions
are
irreconcilable
and
the
government
must
contend
that
allen
was
overruled.
we
see
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
court
overruled
allen.
the
cases
are
different.
the
facts
are
different
and
we
suggest
that
the
decision
in
allen
against
the
regents
is
still
good
law
and
supports
this
case
as
do
other
cases
such
as
lipke
against
lederer,
which
dealt
primarily
with
the
problem
of
a
penalty
being
imposed
in
the
form
of
a
tax,
or
cases
involving
essentially
regulatory
matters,
hill
against
wallace.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
say
that
they
are
irreconcilable
if
the
government
statement
that
there
is
a
substitute
that
enochs
was
a
substitute
for
all
of
the
prior
decisions.
it
becomes
irreconcilable,
but
i
view
that
there
are
--
they
really
deal
with
two
different
kinds
of
exceptions.
there
are,
if
you
will,
parallel
different
classes
of
exceptions
and
that
the
allen
case
supports
the
decision
we’re
asking
this
court
to
affirm
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
we
believe.
i
misspoke
perhaps,
that
they
are
irreconcilable
only
if
you
accept
the
government’s
proposition
that
won
this
a
substitute
for
the
other.
we
believe
they
are
not
irreconcilable
and
that
they
simply
dealt
with
different
situation.
the
williams
packing
case
being
the
classic
case
of
a
taxpayer
seeking
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
its
own
taxes
claiming
verifiably
or
not
that
there
was
irreparable
harm.
this
court
said,
no,
in
that
situation,
irreparable
harm
and
the
adequacy
of
remedy
is
not
enough.
you
must
show
more
and
that’s
what
7421
says
and
we
agree
100%,
but
we
don’t
think
that
deals
with
this
case
where
there
are
different
problems
involved
than
in
that
situation.
all
that
we
are
seeking
here
is
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
question
of
whether
or
not
our
ruling
was
properly
revoked
during
the
course
of
the
litigation.
all
we
want
is
a
chance
to
obtain
an
injunction
so
that
we
will
not
have
to
wait
years
until
the
refund
suit
is
concluded.
we
are
not
as
the
government
suggests
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
38,
asking
for
an
automatic
right
to
retain
the
ruling
regardless
of
the
merits.
we
are
fully
aware
of
the
standards
both
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage
and
what
we
must
do
with
the
merits
in
order
to
retain
the
ruling
which
we
have
been
without
for
almost
four
years
now.
but
at
least,
it’s
a
chance
and
it’s
a
chance
for
organization
such
as
this,
an
equally
important
for
fledgling
organizations
which
have
no
financial
backing
to
rely
against
--
to
rely
on.
just
recently,
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
case
of
center
on
corporate
responsibility
against
schultz,
a
decision
which
the
government
referred
to
in
its
initial
brief
in
this
case,
but
did
not
refer
to
in
its
most
recent
brief,
an
unreported
decision,
but
now
appears
in
the
1974
cch
reporter
at
paragraph
9118,
where
this
court
or
that
court
upheld
the
plaintiff
and
held
that
the
service
had
illegally
ruled
that
it
was
not
entitled
to
a
deduction.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
that
very
case,
the
service
contended
that
in
spite
of
the
allegations
of
political
influence
and
no
basis
at
all
for
denying
the
deduction,
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
and
we
submit
that
7421
was
not
intended
to
apply
in
those
situations,
that
it
was
not
intended
to
act
where
there
was
no
complete
system
of
corrective
justice.
we
see
no
reason
to
this
to
apply
the
statute
which
was
obviously
not
intended
to
reach
charitable
organizations
and
there’s
every
reason
and
not
to
apply
it.
accordingly,
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you.
