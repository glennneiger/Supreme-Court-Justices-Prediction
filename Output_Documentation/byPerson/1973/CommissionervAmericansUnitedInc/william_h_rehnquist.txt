mr.
crampton,
what’s
your
interpretation
of
how
the
court
of
appeals
finding
that
the
government
at
least
had
an
arguable
case
on
the
merits.
how
did
they
get
around
the
williams
packing
statement
that
only
if
the
government
clearly
can’t
prevail
or
an
injunction
to
be
allowed?
i
don’t
mean,
what’s
the
government
position,
but
what’s
your
interpretation
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
many
--
many
of
our
cases
have
held
the
fact
that
constitutional
questions
raised
doesn’t
affect
the
applicability
of
the
anti-injunction
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it’s
really
been
a
burden.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
those
--
mr.
morrison
applied
to
other
organizations
but
not
to
“americans
united.”
how
does
that
bear
on
the
adequacy
of
americans
united's
remedy
at
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
really
saying
that
they
are
irreconcilable
or
that
they
deal
with
two
different
things?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
are
irreconcilable,
i
suppose
the
latest
in
time
would
prevail?
