chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-1371,
alexander
against
“americans
united.”
mr.
crampton,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose,
even
though
these
numbers
are
rather
formidable,
but
the
fact
is
that
only
a
small,
relatively
small
percentage
of
this
120,000
are
organizations
having
significant
amounts
of
money,
and
spending
significant
amounts
of
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
excluding
churches
for
the
moment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
red
cross
has
a
great
deal
of
money.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
wondering,
groping
for
whether
this
is
a
problem
obviously
you
couldn’t
conduct
visitation
of
120,000
or
even
20,000.
but
you
can
keep
a
pretty
close
idea
of
what
--
you
can
have
a
pretty
close
idea
what
the
large
organizations
are
doing
because
if
they’re
doing
a
lot
of
the
forbidden
activities,
then
that
becomes
quite
visible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
don’t
have
great
deal
concern
about
whether
local
parish
churches
are
conducting
lobbying
activities,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
individually?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
problem
is,
it’s
concentrated
in
a
relatively
few
of
the
total
of
120,000.
by
that,
i
mean
maybe
10
or
15
or
20,000,
but
that’s
relatively
few
of
the
total.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
there
are
quite
a
number
of
injunctions
added,
but
no
declaratory
judgment
in
the
traditional
sense,
aren’t
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
when
the
permanent
injunction
is
entered
the
court
has
declared
something,
but
it
isn’t
what
we
think
of
as
a
declaratory
judgment
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
been
puzzled
about
your
time
problem.
i
have
just
been
informed
that
the
electronic
system
has
failed
and
due
process
requires
that
we
allow
you
some
additional
time.
anyway,
we’ll
give
you
three
more
minutes
and
enlarge
your
friend’s
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
actually
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
morrison,
we’ll
enlarge
the
time
on
your
side
of
the
table
by
three
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
has
quite
an
impact
on
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
think
all
of
us,
everyone
on
this
bench
has
had
that
experience
as
a
lawyer,
but
that’s
not
the
heart
of
the
case,
is
it,
or
do
you
think
it
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
morrison,
may
i
help
you
if
i
alert
you
in
the
absence
of
our
lights.
since
you
got
about
two
minutes
left
before
you
impinge
on
mr.
salisbury’s
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
morrison.
mr.
salisbury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
salisbury,
while
you
stop
for
a
moment,
let
me,
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
at
one
focal
point
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
is
the
statement
at
the
end,
it's
on
page
40
of
the
petition
for
the
writ
that
the
possibility
of
success
is
not
so
certain
as
to
merit
the
enochs
exception
with
respect
to
7421
(a)
yet
not
so
frivolous
or
foreclosed
as
to
merit
the
denial
of
the
2282
motion.
i’m
not
exactly
sure
what
that
means
but
do
you
think
it’s
a
correct
statement
of
how
the
issue
should
be
resolved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
they
considered
the
matter
in
some
stage
of
judicial
act
requires
that
it
might
be
either
way,
isn’t
that
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
because
either
way,
doesn’t
anti-injunction
statute
control?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
was
the
standard
that
some
judges
thought
at
the
time
was
the
way
they
implement
the
anti-injunction
statute,
wasn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
asking
enochs
to
be
overruled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
have
you
paid
that
tax
before
this
episode?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn’t
be
depriving
on
something
you
have
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
you
win
--
if
you
win
therefore,
you
won’t
be
eligible
to
pay
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
the
case
after
lunch.[luncheon
recess]
mr.
salisbury,
you
have
about
two
minutes
left
and
the
electronics
are
still
not
functioning
and
so
we’ll
let
you
know
when
your
two
minutes
is
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
you
can
keep
an
eye
on
the
clock
too
while
you
are
arguing.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
mr.

you
have
anything
further

you
