justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
still
true
that
many
listed
aren't
even
in
existence
anymore?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
their
concern
is
on
returns,
isn’t
it,
under
congressional
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
different
from
the
others?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
allege
that?
they
did
allege
that
it
would
be
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
more
difficult
and
practically
put
them
on
the
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
--
aren’t
we
obliged
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
to
recognize
that?
all
in
all
it's
a
hearing
and
attempt
to
prove
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
have
to
offer
that
they
will
not
be
irreparably
harmed,
except
your
imagination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
if
they
were?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
real
problem
as
you
say
it’s
an
injunction
against
taxes,
and
they
say
it’s
an
injunction
against
their
organization
being
able
to
operate
and
i
recognize,
i
don’t
know
which
way
i
come
out,
but
i
think
there
is
a
little
difference
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
when
--
when
were
you
given
these
tax
deductions?
it
was
long
after
the
anti-injunction
statute,
wasn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
the
anti-injunction
statute
apply
to
tax-exempt
corporations
is
the
question
i
think?
you
say
it
does
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
or
do
you
say
it
does
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
say
does
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
number
one,
the
charitable
organization
exemption
came
later.
so
clearly
it
wasn’t
covered
--
wasn’t
intended
to
at
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
relief
here
is
no
relief
which
says
that
you
can’t
collect
taxes,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
donors
were
left
out
of
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
left
the
donors
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
what
i’m
talking
about.
what
we
have
now
two
organizations
and
not
the
donors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
morrison,
you
said
your
exception,
you
came
on,
you
wanted
us
to
establish
an
exception
to
merit
the
injunction
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
maybe
i
ought
to
warn
you.
the
answer
i’d
like
to
get
is
how
we
do
it
without
rewriting
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
case
did
we
rewrite
the
anti-injunction
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
start
all
over
again.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
how
do
you
want
us
do
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
didn’t
have
automobiles
in
mind
either?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
did
have
taxes
in
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
letter
is
not
in
the
record,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
will
prove
that
irs
sends
you
a
letter
and
says,
if
you
file
a
brief
amicus
in
this
court
you
are
influencing
legislation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
to
show
us
that
letter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all,
all
of
the
letters.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
irs
be
required
to
follow
that
as
to
their
contributors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
irs
could
go
along
with
what
the
court
said
about
it,
whichever
way
it
chose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
case
was
--
do
you
mean
that
irs
is
required
to
follow
that
as
to
contributors?
the
irs
says
you
don’t
have
to
pay
these
taxes.
can
irs
also
say,
but
we
will
still
deny
tax
exemption
to
the
contributors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
put
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
no
requirement
though?
that
would
be
up
to
irs,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
