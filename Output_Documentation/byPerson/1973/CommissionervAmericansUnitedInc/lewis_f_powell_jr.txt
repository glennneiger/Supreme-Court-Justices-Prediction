the
second
case,
which
is
alexander
versus
americans
united,
also
involves
the
anti-injunction
act
and
issues
similar,
in
many
respects,
to
those
in
the
case
just
announced.
here,
the
internal
revenue
service
revoked
respondent’s
ruling
letter
because
of
respondent’s
lobbying
activities.
the
effect
of
the
revocation
was
to
render
respondent
liable
for
federal
unemployment
taxes
and
also
to
terminate
its
eligibility
for
tax
deductible
contributions.
respondent
and
two
of
its
benefactors
sought
injunctive
relief
and
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
any
lobbying
provisions
of
the
court
were
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
suit
was
to
raise
constitutional
issues
rather
than
enjoin
collection
of
taxes.
we
conclude
that
the
anti-injunction
act
applies
even
when
constitutional
issues
are
raised
by
the
taxpayer.
we
hold
that
the
act
also
is
applicable
even
though
the
tax
consequences
affect
primarily
the
donors
rather
than
the
organization
holding
the
ruling
letter.
accordingly,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
the
