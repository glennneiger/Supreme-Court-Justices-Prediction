mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
proceedings
before
your
honor,
is
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
all
taxes
are
involved
and
the
basic
issue
is
a
procedural
one,
namely,
do
the
anti-injunction
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act
prevent
the
maintenance
of
this
action
for
injunctive
relief?
this
in
turn
requires
consideration
of
the
structure
which
congress
has
provided
for
the
litigation
of
tax
controversies
namely,
proceedings
to
the
tax
court
and
then
on
appeal
or
first
payment
of
the
tax
and
then
a
refund
suit
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
this
tax
procedure
is
expressly
protected
as
we
view
it
by
the
anti-injunction
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
i
realize
that
when
you’re
in
a
position
of
deferring
judicial
consideration
of
certain
questions
that
is
not
a
popular
position
to
take,
but
it
seems
to
us,
it’s
required
by
the
laws
and
by
the
need
of
the
united
states
to
protect
its
revenues.
the
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
complaint
and
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
sustained
by
the
district
court
and
then
reversed
in
part
by
the
circuit
court.
the
respondent,
americans
united
is
a
nonprofit
educational
corporation
organized
in
1948
under
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia.
its
purpose
as
stated
in
its
charter
is
to
defend
and
maintain
religious
liberty
in
the
united
states
by
the
dissemination
of
knowledge
concerning
the
constitutional
principle
of
the
separation
of
church
and
state.
in
1950,
americans
united
asked
the
internal
revenue
service
for
a
determination
that
it
was
exempt
from
tax
under
comparable
provisions
to
what
is
now
effective
in
the
internal
revenue
code
as
section
501
(c)
(3).
the
revenue
act
of
1954
in
three
sections
provides
for
charitable
deductible
gifts.
one
is
501
(c)
(3)
and
then
the
actual
deductions
allowed
in
170
(c)
(2)
and
then
2055
(a)
(2),
the
latter
being
the
estate
tax
cases.
each
of
this
provisions
limits
a
charitable
deductible
gift
to
an
organization
and
i’m
quoting,
“no
substantial
part
of
the
activities
of
which
is
carrying
on
propaganda
or
otherwise
attempting
to
influence
legislation,
with
minor
exceptions
no
deduction
is
allowed
to
taxpayers
for
political
contributions”
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
quoted
provision
on
the
exempt
organization
simply
carries
out
this
general
policy.
it
may
help
the
court
know
the
procedure
that
is
followed
in
these
cases.
an
organization
claiming
to
be
exempt
files
with
the
internal
revenue
service
a
treasury
department
form
1023
which
discloses
considerable
information
about
its
organization
and
its
form
and
the
pertinent
documents,
whether
it’s
a
successor
to
another
corporation,
a
description
of
its
activities,
any
financial
information
that
it
may
have
or
financial
information
of
predecessor,
and
it
must
show
that
there
will
be
no
return
of
assets
to
the
organizers,
a
sort
of
built-in
side
principle.
if
there
are
any
problems
arising
after
this
is
filed,
as
far
as
the
internal
revenue
is
concerned,
there
are
opportunities
for
conference
and
the
internal
revenue
service
is
quite
willing
to
discuss
the
situation
with
the
organization,
and
tell
them
in
what
particulars
they
do
not
believe
it
complies
and
ultimately
they
frequently,
generally
work
the
situation
out.
if
the
internal
revenue
service
is
satisfied,
it
issues
a
ruling
letter
to
the
exempt
organization
saying
that
it
finds
that
it
has
qualified
under
the
statute.
the
internal
revenue
service
of
course
reserves
the
right
to
look
at
the
operation
and
the
function
of
the
organization
in
later
years
to
see
that
it
is
operating
as
it
represented
it
would
and
furthermore
that
there’s
been
no
change
in
the
situations
that
might
require
a
further
review
of
the
matter.
this
court
some
years
ago
had
a
situation
in
the
american
automobile
association
cases
where
there
was
a
revocation
of
a
ruling
that
had
been
outstanding.
as
far
as
the
exempt
organizations
are
concerned,
there
were
13,000
of
these
ruling
letters
issued
in
the
last
fiscal
year.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
imagine
some
of
it
may
be
brought
to
our
attention
by
other
people
bringing
actions
to
withdraw
the
tax
exempt
status.
we
have
a
number
of
those
cases
and
of
course,
i
suppose,
informers
do
question.
now,
this
is
one
of
our
complaints
with
these
procedure
is
that
i
think
outsiders
use
the
internal
revenue
provisions
as
sort
of
a
club
to
accomplish,
a
purpose
that
they
disagree
with
them
and
to
a
certain
extent,
the
service
does
from
time-to-time
examine
this.
it's
--
i
suppose
they
have
the
same
problem
in
determining
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
don’t
think
they
require
any
reaffirmation
of
that.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that
could
very
well
be.
there
are
--
that’s
my
next
point.
there
are
120,000
of
these
organizations
listed
and
when
you
do
put
an
organization
on
the
list
of
a
cumulative
list
of
organizations
exempt
from
tax,
donors
may
rely
on
that
list
and
make
a
contribution
to
that
organization
with
the
complete
knowledge
that
the
internal
revenue
service
will
not
challenge
the
deduction
and
that’s
why
it’s
so
important.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh,
i’m
not
so
sure
your
honor.
some
of
these
are
churches
and
you
take
some
of
the
main
churches
that
have
tremendous
budgets
and
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
red
cross
might
be
one.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
that’s
true
and
i
think
--
and
the
large
organizations
they
would
–
they
would
just
like
that
in
order
the
income
tax
returns
they
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i’m
not
certain.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i’m
not
certain
about
that,
your
honor.
i
just
mentioned
this
[attempt
to
laughter]
as
an
organization
came
to
mind
having
a
substantial
budget.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh,
i
think
the
problem
with
the
lobbying
is
relatively
small
in
the
exempt
organization
figure.
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
on
that.
i
might
point
out
that
this
advanced
ruling
procedure
that
i’ve
just
been
discussing
in
our
view
i
think
is
unique
in
the
united
states.
it
originally
developed
without
any
statutory
sanction.
it
was
in
aid
to
the
service.
it
was
in
aid
to
the
taxpayers
and
a
convenience
for
all,
but
because
the
service
has
been
doing
--
it
doesn’t
seem
to
us
that
it
alters
the
litigation
process.
now,
in
1968
the
internal
revenue
service
did
take
a
look
at
“americans
united.”
it
reconsidered
the
situation
and
the
revoked
its
prior
letter.
in
doing
so,
it
set
forth
in
number
a
respondent’s
substantial
political
activities
and
invoiced
the
americans
united
in
part
that
by
engaging
in
general
legislative
activities
to
implement
your
views
and
by
urging
the
enactment
or
defeat
of
proposed
legislation
which
you
believe
inamicable
to
your
principles,
you
have
ceased
to
function
exclusively
in
the
educator’s
role
of
informant
and
thereby
encroaching
upon
the
proscribed
legislative
area.
the
internal
revenue
service
concluded
that
the
respondent
was
an
action
organization
and
not
entitled
to
an
exempt
status
under
501
(c)
(3)
and
the
regulations
there
under
and
that
therefore
contributions
to
it
would
no
longer
be
recognized
as
deductible.
shortly
thereafter,
the
internal
revenue
service
did
rule
that
the
respondent
was
an
exempt
under
section
501
(c)
(4)
as
a
“social
welfare”
organization.
so
it
as
an
organization
owes
no
taxes,
but
found
that
this
did
not
affect
the
contributions
to
it.
it
did
not
entitle
its
donors
to
the
charitable
deduction
and
the
exemption
under
501
(c)
(4)
also
required
americans
united
to
pay
employment
taxes.
in
july
of
1970,
the
respondents
brought
this
class
action
on
behalf
of
“americans
united,”
two
individuals
and
all
other
federal
taxpayers
similarly
situated
and
it
was
brought
against
the
commission
of
internal
revenue.
it
asked
for
a
three-judge
statutory
court,
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
and
alleging
that
the
exemption
clauses
of
section
501
(c)
(3)
are
unconstitutional
under
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
the
heart
of
the
complaint
as
we
view
it,
was
the
prayer
to
enjoin
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
from
enforcing
the
provisions
of
section
170
(c)
and
501
(c)
3.
respondent
asserts
in
his
brief
that
the
main
thrust
of
the
revocation
here
is
undeniably
the
imposition
of
a
significant
burden
on
respondent’s
fundraising
capabilities.
we
think
that
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it.
there’s
no
doubt
that
it
did
increase
the
burden,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
main
thrust
of
this
lawsuit
is
to
prevent
--
or
the
commissioner’s
action
is
to
prevent
the
use
of
tax
deductible
dollars
for
lobbying
which
congress
has
proscribed.
the
complaint
speaks
of
depriving
americans
united
of
contributions.
the
actual
effect,
however,
would
be
to
prevent
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
from
assessing
taxes
against
individuals,
corporations
and
the
states
who
would
be
making
contributions
to
americans
united
after
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
had
determined
that
it
no
longer
qualified.
it
is
primarily
this
obstruction
of
the
authority
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
that
government
believes
is
barred
by
the
acts
of
congress.
the
government
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court.
this
was
granted.
the
lower
court
relying
on
the
anti-injunction
act
and
declaratory
judgment
act.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
as
to
“americans
united,”
but
significantly
it
affirmed
as
to
the
two
individuals.
the
result
it
seems
to
us
is
to
permit
the
litigants
to
have
accomplished
indirectly
what
the
lower
courts
could
said
they
could
not
do
directly.
it
stated
in
other
way,
the
donors
as
individuals
could
not
enjoin
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
but
the
donors
by
using
the
so
called
tax
exempt
organization
as
a
party
have,
under
the
holding
of
the
lower
court,
accomplished
the
same
result.
i
think
it
might
help
very
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
the
result
under
the
holding
of
the
lower
court
would
be
that
the
injunction
should
--
the
case
was
referred
for
a
consideration
of
whether
or
not
the
injunction
should
be
granted.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
now,
this
would
open
it
up
for
hearing
on
the
merits
i
think
and
the
court
said
it
was
not
expressing
an
opinion
on
it.
but
we
think
that
procedurally,
there
was
no
ground
for
an
injunction
here
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
the
practical
effect
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
that
would
be
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
we
don’t
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
we’re
not
conceding
that.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
they’re
not
deprived.
they’re
deprived
of
tax
deductible
donations.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
that
depends
on
i
think
on
the
attitude
of
the
donors.
they
are
--
as
far
as
the
small
donations
are
concerned,
i
think
many
people
that
give
$10
to
the
college
don’t
care
whether
or
not
it’s
deductible
or
not
because
they’re
using
the
standard
deduction.
the
large
donors,
if
they
really
are
back
of
an
organization
like
this
would
probably
defer
making
the
gift
until
such
time
as
this
was
decided
if
the
tax
deduction
was
an
important
factor
to
them.
but
we
think
there’s
an
additional
burden
here,
but
we
don’t
think
that’s
anymore
of
an
irreparable
injury
than
are
many
other
situations
where
parties
are
forced
to
pay
taxes
and
then
litigate
or
wait
a
decision
of
a
question
of
law
or
fact
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
they
did
and
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
but
what
they
want
is
an
injunction
in
the
interim
and
we
think
that
they’re
not
entitled
to
that
under
the
anti-injunction
act.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think
that
--
i’m
not
saying
that
there
won’t
be
harmed,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
irreparable.
i
think
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
that
comes
right
back
to
williams
packing
case.
the
williams
packing
case
enforced
the
injunction
even
though
there
they
said
it
would
put
them
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
just
that
and
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
but
the
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
--
there
is
a
little
difference.
if
you
can
look
at
the
organization
but
i
think
when
you
look,
take
it
one
step
further,
you
are
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
we
say
it
does.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
but
the
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh,
yes.
the
action
right
here
says
that
he
can’t
collect
from
the
donors.
and
it
could
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
there
are
two
donors.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right,
it
did.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
if
the
donors
--
if
the
commissioner
is
enjoined
from
enforcing
the
provisions
under
the
statute,
he
can’t
go
after
the
donor.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
federal
unemployment
taxes
are
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
we
say
that
they
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right
and
we
are.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
we
ask
here
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
from
the
organization
itself.
now,
the
anti-injunction
act
as
your
honor
suggested
came
in
a
long
time
ago,
1867,
but
--
and
but
the
significant
thing
is
we
say
is
that
this
was
reaffirmed
by
congress
when
it
re-enacted
the
revenue
code
or
when
it
enacted
the
revenue
code
in
1954.
and
the
only
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act
that
we
believe
is
pertinent
is
the
one
this
court
announced
in
the
enochs
versus
williams
packing
company
case
where
the
taxpayer
alleged
it
would
go
into
bankruptcy
and
the
court
said
well,
still
the
statute
had
to
be
enforced.
unless
the
taxpayer
could
show
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
government
prevail
and
second,
that
equity
jurisdiction
exists
because
of
irreparable
injury
for
which
there
was
no
adequate
legal
remedy.
the
second
statute,
i’ve
been
talking
so
far
primarily
about
the
anti-injunction
act,
but
we
also
rely
equally
on
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
and
this
court
may
recall
that
that
was
originally
passed
in
the
early
1930s
and
was
silent
as
to
taxes.
there
were
several
attempts
made
shortly
thereafter
to
apply
that
statute
to
taxes
and
congress
in
1935
promptly
amended
the
act
to
provide
that
it
should
not
apply
to
any
suit
with
respect
to
federal
taxes.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
again
a
congressional
affirmance
of
the
anti-injunction
act,
at
least
a
philosophy
that
you
can’t
enjoin
taxes.
the
legislative
history
of
this
amendment
shows
clearly
that
congress
thought
the
existing
remedies
provided
--
existing
procedures
provided
ample
remedies
for
the
correction
of
tax
errors.
the
basic
complaint
of
the
respondent
is
that
the
action
of
the
internal
revenue
service
has
materially
deterred
its
contributors
and
i
think
this
is
true
as
i
have
mentioned.
but
i
think
the
same
could
be
said
for
the
failure
of
the
internal
revenue
to
issue
the
ruling
in
the
first
place.
but
where
there
is
a
factual
or
legal
controversy,
the
statutes
just
do
not
give
a
tax
exempt
status
pendente
lite
and
we
believe
it
should
not
be
the
role
of
the
courts
to
provide
one.
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws
has
been
delegated
to
the
treasury
and
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
if
the
internal
revenue
code
is
to
be
administered
by
injunctions
it
seems
to
us
that
nothing
but
chaos
is
going
to
be
the
end-result.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no
and
we
think
we
can
live
with
the
williams
packing
company
case.
the
--
you
see
those
two
tests
are
not
the
ones
they
are
meeting
here.
and
my
thought
on
--
continuing
my
thought
of
chaos
is
we
have
400
some
district
judges
and
a
number
of
suits
now
pending
where
the
--
which
request
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
to
reserve
--
to
remove
the
tax
exemption
of
such
organizations
as
labor
unions,
fraternal
clubs,
and
hospitals.
it’s
quite
conceivable
that
some
organization
which
is
opposing
the
views
of
the
americans
united
would
bring
a
similar
suit.
this
might
result
in
conflicting
injunctions
in
different
jurisdictions
and
complete
confusion
as
we
see
it.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
cited
two
of
these
cases.
one
is
the
cattle
feeders
case
out
in
oklahoma
and
which
the
--
enjoins
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
from
applying
a
ruling
that
the
internal
revenue
service
was
to
promulgate
regarding
year-end
purchases
of
feed
where
in
the
view
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
it
distorted
income.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
also
been
ordered
to
revoke
the
exemption
of
a
hospital
where
it
did
not
admit
indigent
patients.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
latter
case
is
another
example
of
the
use
of
the
tax
laws
anti-injunction
procedure
as
a
club
and
where
there
is
primarily
a
fight
between
private
parties.
it’s
our
view
that
the
administration
of
the
tax
law
should
not
be
by
injunction
and
that
if
the
internal
revenue
service
is
wrong
in
its
determination
regarding
americans
united
there
are
two
adequate
remedies
at
law.
the
first
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
is
a
suit
to
--
against
the
--
by
the
organization
itself
to
recover
the
employment
taxes
that
it’s
been
forced
to
pay.
in
such
a
proceeding,
it
can
come
in,
claim
it’s
exempt
under
section
501
(c)
(3)
and
argue
the
merits
of
that
position.
a
second
proceeding,
it
would
be
the
suit
by
what
the
briefs
refer
to
as
the
friendly
donor.
usually,
that’s
the
secretary
or
somebody
with
a
relatively
simple
return
perhaps
on
the
w-2
form.
they
make
a
contribution
to
an
organization
such
as
this,
file
a
claim
for
refund
and
then
litigate
it
and
that
is
a
decision
on
the
merits.
it’s
a
device
that’s
frequently
used
by
corporations
to
test
taxability
of
dividends.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that
allegation
is
made
and
i
think
they
do
refer
to
a
church
of
scientology
case
and
that
case
in
our
view
was
not
in
point.
that
was
a
question
whether
in
that
year,
money
enured
to
organizers
and
there
was
discovery
proceeding
as
i
understand
it.
they
were
convinced
that
it
did
not
enure
in
that
year
and
they
made
them
a
refund
and
mooted
it
out.
but
i
believe
the
service
would
welcome
a
chance
to
test
this
on
the
merits
and
certainly,
insofar
as
those
of
us
who
are
presently
in
the
department
of
justice
are
concerned,
we
think
this
is
the
way
to
meet
the
situation
and
i
have
told
a
number
of
tax-exempt
organizations
that
as
far
as
i
personally
was
concerned
will
meet
them
in
court
anytime
on
this
fact
question
and
get
it
decided.
and
i
think
the
internal
revenue
service
shares
that
view
and
they
would
honor
a
finding
like
that
assuming
of
course
that
the
operations
are
conducted
the
same
way
in
successive
years.
the
respondent
speaks
of
itself
as
being
a
principle
party
but
it
seems
to
us
here
in
legal
effect
it
is
acting
as
agent
for
its
contributors.
they
are
also
real
parties
and
interests
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
internal
--
the
injunction
would
prevent
the
internal
revenue
service
from
asserting
taxes
against
the
donors.
in
the
meantime,
the
statute
of
limitations
may
run.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
declaratory
judgment
isn’t
independent
reaffirmation
of
the
anti-injunction
case
and
that
both
of
these
simply
bar
the
present
type
of
an
action.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes,
we
say
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
no,
i
think
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
would
probably
be
a
little
bit
broader
because
when
you
use
the
phrase
with
respect
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
it’s
broader
and
it’s
a
more
recent
enactment.
it
mentions
the
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
haven’t
thought
about
that,
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor.
it
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
would
think
you
could
have
an
injunction
and
then
your
declaratory
judgment
might
not
be.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
they
are
not
quite
the
same.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
i
think
the
concepts
at
least
to
my
thinking
are
somewhat
different
and
i
come
back
to
mr.
justice
white's
point,
i
think
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
is
even
broader
than
the
anti-injunction
act.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
am
not
quite
sure.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
had
trouble
just
reading
how
they
were
getting
around
those
myself
but
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think,
yes.
whether
they
can
get
around
them
because
i
think
what
the
court
has
tried
to
construct
is
sort
of
a
detour
around
these
two
statutes
and
i’d
like
to
touch
briefly
on
this
question
that
you
raise
as
of
substantial.
the
theory
or
the
claim
is
that
a
large
organization
spending
“x”
percent
of
its
budget
can
do
more
permissible
lobbying
than
a
smaller
organization
spending
the
same
percent
of
its
budget.
i
think
it’s
significant
on
our
procedural
problem
here
that
the
lower
court
didn’t
hold
that
under
no
circumstance
could
the
government
prevail.
it
simply
said,
they
thought
this
might
--
ought
to
go
to
hearing
on
the
merits.
it’s
our
view
that
the
word
substantial
must
be
related
to
the
person
involved.
the
tax
laws
are
full
of
such
arbitrary
lines.
one
man
may
get
a
larger
charitable
or
medical
deduction
than
another.
one
man
may
get
a
deferral
of
a
larger
amount
on
his
installment
sale
than
another
because
it’s
a
bigger
transaction.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
in
my
judgment
is
a
rough
question
because
i
read
that
thing
and
i
tried
to
see
where
he
came
out
on
it
and
i
have
had
difficulty.
he
simply
seem
to
think
that
this
was
a
question
that
ought
to
be
–
raise
a
constitutional
point
perhaps
because
there
was
an
allegation
of
constitutional
issues,
this
shouldn’t
be
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right
and
we’ve
cited
them
in
our
brief
and
i
say
i
have
had
trouble
reading
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
to
see
where
he
just
avoids
the
statutes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
[laughter]
they’ll
have
an
opportunity
in
just
a
minute
to
explain
that
and
maybe
they
can
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
better
than
i
can.
i
might
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
so.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
true.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
and
you
wonder
what
the
test
might
be,
if
you
put
a
dollar
amount
in
then
an
organization
under
the
dollar
amount
might
devote
a
hundred
percent
to
it
whereas
a
bigger
organization
would
be
only
devoting
a
fraction
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
about
the
best
test
congress
could
device.
i
might
close,
i’m
concerned
about
my
time,
i
haven’t
seen
the
light,
but
we’d
like
to
say
that
while
we’re
not
unsympathetic
with
the
problem
of
the
americans
united
has,
we
believe
the
solution
is
on
legislation.
we
believe
that
solution
is
coming.
their
judicial
review
of
this
type
of
a
problem
is
presently
being
considered
in
the
field
of
pension
plans.
in
hr
4200,
93rd
congress,
the
first
session
in
section
601,
they
are
providing
for
or
al
least
proposed
to
provide
for
an
appeal
to
the
tax
court
from
rulings
in
the
pension
field.
i
understand
this
act
has
passed
both
houses
and
is
in
conference,
but
not
on
this
point.
the
section
--
a
committee
of
the
section
of
taxation
is
considering
a
similar
--
it
wouldn’t
affect
this
case.
no,
but
it
will
affect
future
if
this
is
enacted.
it
will
be
in
effect
the
exempt
organization.
but
a
committee
of
the
section
of
taxation
in
american
bar
association
is
presently
considering
whether
a
similar
recommendation
should
be
made
in
the
field
of
exempt
organizations.
that
isn't
cited
in
our
briefs,
but
you
can
find
a
reference
to
that
in
26
the
tax
lawyer
at
page
628.
it
seems
to
us
that
it’s
clearly
the
scope
of
this
legislation
is
to
be
determined
by
congress
and
we
submit
that
that’s
where
the
relief,
if
any,
should
be
and
not
by
seeking
a
judicial
remedy
here
which
in
our
view
the
statutes
just
did
not
provide
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
thank
you.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
thought
of
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
answer
with
a
little
--
in
a
little
more
detail
the
question
which
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
me
about
whether
or
not
returns
are
required.
i
knew
that
annual
returns
were
required,
but
i
wasn’t
concerned
--
i
didn’t,
my
recollection
wasn’t
too
clear
on
just
what
was
required
in
those
returns
as
to
the
continuing
of
material
relating
to
continued
tax
exemption.
i
am
now
advised
that
you
are
required
to
state
whether
or
not
you
have
made
any
change
in
your
activities,
but
other
than
that,
the
return
is
one
of
financial
information
and
of
course,
it
would
not
catch
a
situation
or
trigger
a
situation
where
perhaps
the
commissioner
has
changed
his
view
as
to
situations
such
that
might
have
here.
i’d
like
to
reply
very
briefly
to
counsel
suggestion
that
the
size
of
the
employment
taxes
has
some
factor.
i
don’t
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
it
at
all.
he
can
sue
for
$10
and
in
that
proceeding
argued
that
he
is
an
exempt
--
he
represents
an
organization
exempt
under
501
(c)
(3)
and
i
think
had
he
done
so,
this
question
would
have
been
decided
by
and
now
and
has
been
decided
on
its
merits.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
he
wants
a
determination
that
he
is
an
exempt
organization
and
i
think
he
would
have
gotten
it
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
because
i
think
to
get
the
refund
of
employment
taxes
the
court
would
there
to
determine
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
--
that
the
an
organization
is
exempt
under
501
(c)
(3).
now
to
the
extent
that
he
may
say
--
be
saying,
“i
want
to
do
something
for
other
organizations,”
our
position
is
that’s
not
the
case
here.
we’re
talking
about
“americans
united.”
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
as
to
future
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
they
would
and
i
think
that’s
their
policy
and
we
certainly
would
--
assuming
the
organization
continued
to
operate
the
same
way
in
later
years
that
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
test
case,
i
think
that
would
be
a
complete
answer
and
they
put
their
name
back.
they
do
require
them
to
file
an
application.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
the
way
the
procedure
that
they
have
is
the
irs
after
case
like
that
ask
you
to
submit
an
application
referring
to
the
case
as
the
reason
for
that
you’re
now
qualified
as
tax-exempt
organization.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
and
they
would
then
put
your
name
back
on
the
list.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think
that’s
right,
your
honor,
but
i
think
you
could
assume
a
good
faith
with
the
government
in
a
situation
like
that.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
am
not
sure
of
that
question,
your
honor.
i
know
they
can
under
social
security
taxes,
whether
they
can
under
employment
taxes,
i
don’t
know.
i
would
like
to
comment
just
briefly
on
the
allen
case.
in
that
situation,
the
university
of
georgia
was
a
collector
of
taxes.
it
was
not
a
taxpayer
and
so
it
had
not
means
of
independent
judicial
review
and
i
think
that
completely
distinguishes
that
case.
and
if
all
that
the
respondent
wants
is
a
determination
of
the
word
“substantial”
should
be
read
out
of
section
501
(c)
(3),
we
think
they
could
have
had
that
holding
if
their
right
made
in
a
refund
suit
and
that’s
the
place
to
do
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
it’s
our
view
that
it
would
because
that
suit
would
be
based
on
the
theory
that
we
are
an
exempt
organization
under
section
501
(c)
(3)
and
therefore
we
don’t
have
to
pay
the
futa
taxes
and
if
the
court
agreed
with
them,
you’d
have
a
determination
that
it
was
an
exempt
organization.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
proceedings
before
your
honor,
is
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
all
taxes
are
involved
and
the
basic
issue
is
a
procedural
one,
namely,
do
the
anti-injunction
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act
prevent
the
maintenance
of
this
action
for
injunctive
relief?
this
in
turn
requires
consideration
of
the
structure
which
congress
has
provided
for
the
litigation
of
tax
controversies
namely,
proceedings
to
the
tax
court
and
then
on
appeal
or
first
payment
of
the
tax
and
then
a
refund
suit
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
this
tax
procedure
is
expressly
protected
as
we
view
it
by
the
anti-injunction
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
i
realize
that
when
you’re
in
a
position
of
deferring
judicial
consideration
of
certain
questions
that
is
not
a
popular
position
to
take,
but
it
seems
to
us,
it’s
required
by
the
laws
and
by
the
need
of
the
united
states
to
protect
its
revenues.
the
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
complaint
and
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
sustained
by
the
district
court
and
then
reversed
in
part
by
the
circuit
court.
the
respondent,
americans
united
is
a
nonprofit
educational
corporation
organized
in
1948
under
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia.
its
purpose
as
stated
in
its
charter
is
to
defend
and
maintain
religious
liberty
in
the
united
states
by
the
dissemination
of
knowledge
concerning
the
constitutional
principle
of
the
separation
of
church
and
state.
in
1950,
americans
united
asked
the
internal
revenue
service
for
a
determination
that
it
was
exempt
from
tax
under
comparable
provisions
to
what
is
now
effective
in
the
internal
revenue
code
as
section
501
(c)
(3).
the
revenue
act
of
1954
in
three
sections
provides
for
charitable
deductible
gifts.
one
is
501
(c)
(3)
and
then
the
actual
deductions
allowed
in
170
(c)
(2)
and
then
2055
(a)
(2),
the
latter
being
the
estate
tax
cases.
each
of
this
provisions
limits
a
charitable
deductible
gift
to
an
organization
and
i’m
quoting,
“no
substantial
part
of
the
activities
of
which
is
carrying
on
propaganda
or
otherwise
attempting
to
influence
legislation,
with
minor
exceptions
no
deduction
is
allowed
to
taxpayers
for
political
contributions”
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
quoted
provision
on
the
exempt
organization
simply
carries
out
this
general
policy.
it
may
help
the
court
know
the
procedure
that
is
followed
in
these
cases.
an
organization
claiming
to
be
exempt
files
with
the
internal
revenue
service
a
treasury
department
form
1023
which
discloses
considerable
information
about
its
organization
and
its
form
and
the
pertinent
documents,
whether
it’s
a
successor
to
another
corporation,
a
description
of
its
activities,
any
financial
information
that
it
may
have
or
financial
information
of
predecessor,
and
it
must
show
that
there
will
be
no
return
of
assets
to
the
organizers,
a
sort
of
built-in
side
principle.
if
there
are
any
problems
arising
after
this
is
filed,
as
far
as
the
internal
revenue
is
concerned,
there
are
opportunities
for
conference
and
the
internal
revenue
service
is
quite
willing
to
discuss
the
situation
with
the
organization,
and
tell
them
in
what
particulars
they
do
not
believe
it
complies
and
ultimately
they
frequently,
generally
work
the
situation
out.
if
the
internal
revenue
service
is
satisfied,
it
issues
a
ruling
letter
to
the
exempt
organization
saying
that
it
finds
that
it
has
qualified
under
the
statute.
the
internal
revenue
service
of
course
reserves
the
right
to
look
at
the
operation
and
the
function
of
the
organization
in
later
years
to
see
that
it
is
operating
as
it
represented
it
would
and
furthermore
that
there’s
been
no
change
in
the
situations
that
might
require
a
further
review
of
the
matter.
this
court
some
years
ago
had
a
situation
in
the
american
automobile
association
cases
where
there
was
a
revocation
of
a
ruling
that
had
been
outstanding.
as
far
as
the
exempt
organizations
are
concerned,
there
were
13,000
of
these
ruling
letters
issued
in
the
last
fiscal
year.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
imagine
some
of
it
may
be
brought
to
our
attention
by
other
people
bringing
actions
to
withdraw
the
tax
exempt
status.
we
have
a
number
of
those
cases
and
of
course,
i
suppose,
informers
do
question.
now,
this
is
one
of
our
complaints
with
these
procedure
is
that
i
think
outsiders
use
the
internal
revenue
provisions
as
sort
of
a
club
to
accomplish,
a
purpose
that
they
disagree
with
them
and
to
a
certain
extent,
the
service
does
from
time-to-time
examine
this.
it's
--
i
suppose
they
have
the
same
problem
in
determining
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
don’t
believe
so.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
don’t
think
they
require
any
reaffirmation
of
that.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that
could
very
well
be.
there
are
--
that’s
my
next
point.
there
are
120,000
of
these
organizations
listed
and
when
you
do
put
an
organization
on
the
list
of
a
cumulative
list
of
organizations
exempt
from
tax,
donors
may
rely
on
that
list
and
make
a
contribution
to
that
organization
with
the
complete
knowledge
that
the
internal
revenue
service
will
not
challenge
the
deduction
and
that’s
why
it’s
so
important.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh,
i’m
not
so
sure
your
honor.
some
of
these
are
churches
and
you
take
some
of
the
main
churches
that
have
tremendous
budgets
and
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
red
cross
might
be
one.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
that’s
true
and
i
think
--
and
the
large
organizations
they
would
–
they
would
just
like
that
in
order
the
income
tax
returns
they
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i’m
not
certain.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i’m
not
certain
about
that,
your
honor.
i
just
mentioned
this
[attempt
to
laughter]
as
an
organization
came
to
mind
having
a
substantial
budget.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh,
i
think
the
problem
with
the
lobbying
is
relatively
small
in
the
exempt
organization
figure.
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
on
that.
i
might
point
out
that
this
advanced
ruling
procedure
that
i’ve
just
been
discussing
in
our
view
i
think
is
unique
in
the
united
states.
it
originally
developed
without
any
statutory
sanction.
it
was
in
aid
to
the
service.
it
was
in
aid
to
the
taxpayers
and
a
convenience
for
all,
but
because
the
service
has
been
doing
--
it
doesn’t
seem
to
us
that
it
alters
the
litigation
process.
now,
in
1968
the
internal
revenue
service
did
take
a
look
at
“americans
united.”
it
reconsidered
the
situation
and
the
revoked
its
prior
letter.
in
doing
so,
it
set
forth
in
number
a
respondent’s
substantial
political
activities
and
invoiced
the
americans
united
in
part
that
by
engaging
in
general
legislative
activities
to
implement
your
views
and
by
urging
the
enactment
or
defeat
of
proposed
legislation
which
you
believe
inamicable
to
your
principles,
you
have
ceased
to
function
exclusively
in
the
educator’s
role
of
informant
and
thereby
encroaching
upon
the
proscribed
legislative
area.
the
internal
revenue
service
concluded
that
the
respondent
was
an
action
organization
and
not
entitled
to
an
exempt
status
under
501
(c)
(3)
and
the
regulations
there
under
and
that
therefore
contributions
to
it
would
no
longer
be
recognized
as
deductible.
shortly
thereafter,
the
internal
revenue
service
did
rule
that
the
respondent
was
an
exempt
under
section
501
(c)
(4)
as
a
“social
welfare”
organization.
so
it
as
an
organization
owes
no
taxes,
but
found
that
this
did
not
affect
the
contributions
to
it.
it
did
not
entitle
its
donors
to
the
charitable
deduction
and
the
exemption
under
501
(c)
(4)
also
required
americans
united
to
pay
employment
taxes.
in
july
of
1970,
the
respondents
brought
this
class
action
on
behalf
of
“americans
united,”
two
individuals
and
all
other
federal
taxpayers
similarly
situated
and
it
was
brought
against
the
commission
of
internal
revenue.
it
asked
for
a
three-judge
statutory
court,
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
and
alleging
that
the
exemption
clauses
of
section
501
(c)
(3)
are
unconstitutional
under
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
the
heart
of
the
complaint
as
we
view
it,
was
the
prayer
to
enjoin
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
from
enforcing
the
provisions
of
section
170
(c)
and
501
(c)
3.
respondent
asserts
in
his
brief
that
the
main
thrust
of
the
revocation
here
is
undeniably
the
imposition
of
a
significant
burden
on
respondent’s
fundraising
capabilities.
we
think
that
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it.
there’s
no
doubt
that
it
did
increase
the
burden,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
main
thrust
of
this
lawsuit
is
to
prevent
--
or
the
commissioner’s
action
is
to
prevent
the
use
of
tax
deductible
dollars
for
lobbying
which
congress
has
proscribed.
the
complaint
speaks
of
depriving
americans
united
of
contributions.
the
actual
effect,
however,
would
be
to
prevent
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
from
assessing
taxes
against
individuals,
corporations
and
the
states
who
would
be
making
contributions
to
americans
united
after
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
had
determined
that
it
no
longer
qualified.
it
is
primarily
this
obstruction
of
the
authority
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
that
government
believes
is
barred
by
the
acts
of
congress.
the
government
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court.
this
was
granted.
the
lower
court
relying
on
the
anti-injunction
act
and
declaratory
judgment
act.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
as
to
“americans
united,”
but
significantly
it
affirmed
as
to
the
two
individuals.
the
result
it
seems
to
us
is
to
permit
the
litigants
to
have
accomplished
indirectly
what
the
lower
courts
could
said
they
could
not
do
directly.
it
stated
in
other
way,
the
donors
as
individuals
could
not
enjoin
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
but
the
donors
by
using
the
so
called
tax
exempt
organization
as
a
party
have,
under
the
holding
of
the
lower
court,
accomplished
the
same
result.
i
think
it
might
help
very
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
the
result
under
the
holding
of
the
lower
court
would
be
that
the
injunction
should
--
the
case
was
referred
for
a
consideration
of
whether
or
not
the
injunction
should
be
granted.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
now,
this
would
open
it
up
for
hearing
on
the
merits
i
think
and
the
court
said
it
was
not
expressing
an
opinion
on
it.
but
we
think
that
procedurally,
there
was
no
ground
for
an
injunction
here
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
the
practical
effect
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
that
would
be
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
we
don’t
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
we’re
not
conceding
that.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
they’re
not
deprived.
they’re
deprived
of
tax
deductible
donations.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
that
depends
on
i
think
on
the
attitude
of
the
donors.
they
are
--
as
far
as
the
small
donations
are
concerned,
i
think
many
people
that
give
$10
to
the
college
don’t
care
whether
or
not
it’s
deductible
or
not
because
they’re
using
the
standard
deduction.
the
large
donors,
if
they
really
are
back
of
an
organization
like
this
would
probably
defer
making
the
gift
until
such
time
as
this
was
decided
if
the
tax
deduction
was
an
important
factor
to
them.
but
we
think
there’s
an
additional
burden
here,
but
we
don’t
think
that’s
anymore
of
an
irreparable
injury
than
are
many
other
situations
where
parties
are
forced
to
pay
taxes
and
then
litigate
or
wait
a
decision
of
a
question
of
law
or
fact
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
they
did
and
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
but
what
they
want
is
an
injunction
in
the
interim
and
we
think
that
they’re
not
entitled
to
that
under
the
anti-injunction
act.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think
that
--
i’m
not
saying
that
there
won’t
be
harmed,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
irreparable.
i
think
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
that
comes
right
back
to
williams
packing
case.
the
williams
packing
case
enforced
the
injunction
even
though
there
they
said
it
would
put
them
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
just
that
and
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
but
the
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
--
there
is
a
little
difference.
if
you
can
look
at
the
organization
but
i
think
when
you
look,
take
it
one
step
further,
you
are
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor’s
question.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
we
say
it
does.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
but
the
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh,
yes.
the
action
right
here
says
that
he
can’t
collect
from
the
donors.
and
it
could
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
there
are
two
donors.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right,
it
did.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
if
the
donors
--
if
the
commissioner
is
enjoined
from
enforcing
the
provisions
under
the
statute,
he
can’t
go
after
the
donor.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
federal
unemployment
taxes
are
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
we
say
that
they
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right
and
we
are.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
we
ask
here
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
from
the
organization
itself.
now,
the
anti-injunction
act
as
your
honor
suggested
came
in
a
long
time
ago,
1867,
but
--
and
but
the
significant
thing
is
we
say
is
that
this
was
reaffirmed
by
congress
when
it
re-enacted
the
revenue
code
or
when
it
enacted
the
revenue
code
in
1954.
and
the
only
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act
that
we
believe
is
pertinent
is
the
one
this
court
announced
in
the
enochs
versus
williams
packing
company
case
where
the
taxpayer
alleged
it
would
go
into
bankruptcy
and
the
court
said
well,
still
the
statute
had
to
be
enforced.
unless
the
taxpayer
could
show
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
government
prevail
and
second,
that
equity
jurisdiction
exists
because
of
irreparable
injury
for
which
there
was
no
adequate
legal
remedy.
the
second
statute,
i’ve
been
talking
so
far
primarily
about
the
anti-injunction
act,
but
we
also
rely
equally
on
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
and
this
court
may
recall
that
that
was
originally
passed
in
the
early
1930s
and
was
silent
as
to
taxes.
there
were
several
attempts
made
shortly
thereafter
to
apply
that
statute
to
taxes
and
congress
in
1935
promptly
amended
the
act
to
provide
that
it
should
not
apply
to
any
suit
with
respect
to
federal
taxes.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
again
a
congressional
affirmance
of
the
anti-injunction
act,
at
least
a
philosophy
that
you
can’t
enjoin
taxes.
the
legislative
history
of
this
amendment
shows
clearly
that
congress
thought
the
existing
remedies
provided
--
existing
procedures
provided
ample
remedies
for
the
correction
of
tax
errors.
the
basic
complaint
of
the
respondent
is
that
the
action
of
the
internal
revenue
service
has
materially
deterred
its
contributors
and
i
think
this
is
true
as
i
have
mentioned.
but
i
think
the
same
could
be
said
for
the
failure
of
the
internal
revenue
to
issue
the
ruling
in
the
first
place.
but
where
there
is
a
factual
or
legal
controversy,
the
statutes
just
do
not
give
a
tax
exempt
status
pendente
lite
and
we
believe
it
should
not
be
the
role
of
the
courts
to
provide
one.
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws
has
been
delegated
to
the
treasury
and
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
if
the
internal
revenue
code
is
to
be
administered
by
injunctions
it
seems
to
us
that
nothing
but
chaos
is
going
to
be
the
end-result.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no
and
we
think
we
can
live
with
the
williams
packing
company
case.
the
--
you
see
those
two
tests
are
not
the
ones
they
are
meeting
here.
and
my
thought
on
--
continuing
my
thought
of
chaos
is
we
have
400
some
district
judges
and
a
number
of
suits
now
pending
where
the
--
which
request
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
to
reserve
--
to
remove
the
tax
exemption
of
such
organizations
as
labor
unions,
fraternal
clubs,
and
hospitals.
it’s
quite
conceivable
that
some
organization
which
is
opposing
the
views
of
the
americans
united
would
bring
a
similar
suit.
this
might
result
in
conflicting
injunctions
in
different
jurisdictions
and
complete
confusion
as
we
see
it.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
cited
two
of
these
cases.
one
is
the
cattle
feeders
case
out
in
oklahoma
and
which
the
--
enjoins
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
from
applying
a
ruling
that
the
internal
revenue
service
was
to
promulgate
regarding
year-end
purchases
of
feed
where
in
the
view
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
it
distorted
income.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
also
been
ordered
to
revoke
the
exemption
of
a
hospital
where
it
did
not
admit
indigent
patients.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
latter
case
is
another
example
of
the
use
of
the
tax
laws
anti-injunction
procedure
as
a
club
and
where
there
is
primarily
a
fight
between
private
parties.
it’s
our
view
that
the
administration
of
the
tax
law
should
not
be
by
injunction
and
that
if
the
internal
revenue
service
is
wrong
in
its
determination
regarding
americans
united
there
are
two
adequate
remedies
at
law.
the
first
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
is
a
suit
to
--
against
the
--
by
the
organization
itself
to
recover
the
employment
taxes
that
it’s
been
forced
to
pay.
in
such
a
proceeding,
it
can
come
in,
claim
it’s
exempt
under
section
501
(c)
(3)
and
argue
the
merits
of
that
position.
a
second
proceeding,
it
would
be
the
suit
by
what
the
briefs
refer
to
as
the
friendly
donor.
usually,
that’s
the
secretary
or
somebody
with
a
relatively
simple
return
perhaps
on
the
w-2
form.
they
make
a
contribution
to
an
organization
such
as
this,
file
a
claim
for
refund
and
then
litigate
it
and
that
is
a
decision
on
the
merits.
it’s
a
device
that’s
frequently
used
by
corporations
to
test
taxability
of
dividends.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that
allegation
is
made
and
i
think
they
do
refer
to
a
church
of
scientology
case
and
that
case
in
our
view
was
not
in
point.
that
was
a
question
whether
in
that
year,
money
enured
to
organizers
and
there
was
discovery
proceeding
as
i
understand
it.
they
were
convinced
that
it
did
not
enure
in
that
year
and
they
made
them
a
refund
and
mooted
it
out.
but
i
believe
the
service
would
welcome
a
chance
to
test
this
on
the
merits
and
certainly,
insofar
as
those
of
us
who
are
presently
in
the
department
of
justice
are
concerned,
we
think
this
is
the
way
to
meet
the
situation
and
i
have
told
a
number
of
tax-exempt
organizations
that
as
far
as
i
personally
was
concerned
will
meet
them
in
court
anytime
on
this
fact
question
and
get
it
decided.
and
i
think
the
internal
revenue
service
shares
that
view
and
they
would
honor
a
finding
like
that
assuming
of
course
that
the
operations
are
conducted
the
same
way
in
successive
years.
the
respondent
speaks
of
itself
as
being
a
principle
party
but
it
seems
to
us
here
in
legal
effect
it
is
acting
as
agent
for
its
contributors.
they
are
also
real
parties
and
interests
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
internal
--
the
injunction
would
prevent
the
internal
revenue
service
from
asserting
taxes
against
the
donors.
in
the
meantime,
the
statute
of
limitations
may
run.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
declaratory
judgment
isn’t
independent
reaffirmation
of
the
anti-injunction
case
and
that
both
of
these
simply
bar
the
present
type
of
an
action.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes,
we
say
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
no,
i
think
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
would
probably
be
a
little
bit
broader
because
when
you
use
the
phrase
with
respect
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
it’s
broader
and
it’s
a
more
recent
enactment.
it
mentions
the
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
haven’t
thought
about
that,
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor.
it
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
would
think
you
could
have
an
injunction
and
then
your
declaratory
judgment
might
not
be.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
they
are
not
quite
the
same.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
i
think
the
concepts
at
least
to
my
thinking
are
somewhat
different
and
i
come
back
to
mr.
justice
white's
point,
i
think
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
is
even
broader
than
the
anti-injunction
act.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
am
not
quite
sure.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
had
trouble
just
reading
how
they
were
getting
around
those
myself
but
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think,
yes.
whether
they
can
get
around
them
because
i
think
what
the
court
has
tried
to
construct
is
sort
of
a
detour
around
these
two
statutes
and
i’d
like
to
touch
briefly
on
this
question
that
you
raise
as
of
substantial.
the
theory
or
the
claim
is
that
a
large
organization
spending
“x”
percent
of
its
budget
can
do
more
permissible
lobbying
than
a
smaller
organization
spending
the
same
percent
of
its
budget.
i
think
it’s
significant
on
our
procedural
problem
here
that
the
lower
court
didn’t
hold
that
under
no
circumstance
could
the
government
prevail.
it
simply
said,
they
thought
this
might
--
ought
to
go
to
hearing
on
the
merits.
it’s
our
view
that
the
word
substantial
must
be
related
to
the
person
involved.
the
tax
laws
are
full
of
such
arbitrary
lines.
one
man
may
get
a
larger
charitable
or
medical
deduction
than
another.
one
man
may
get
a
deferral
of
a
larger
amount
on
his
installment
sale
than
another
because
it’s
a
bigger
transaction.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
in
my
judgment
is
a
rough
question
because
i
read
that
thing
and
i
tried
to
see
where
he
came
out
on
it
and
i
have
had
difficulty.
he
simply
seem
to
think
that
this
was
a
question
that
ought
to
be
–
raise
a
constitutional
point
perhaps
because
there
was
an
allegation
of
constitutional
issues,
this
shouldn’t
be
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right
and
we’ve
cited
them
in
our
brief
and
i
say
i
have
had
trouble
reading
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
to
see
where
he
just
avoids
the
statutes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
[laughter]
they’ll
have
an
opportunity
in
just
a
minute
to
explain
that
and
maybe
they
can
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
better
than
i
can.
i
might
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
so.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
true.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
and
you
wonder
what
the
test
might
be,
if
you
put
a
dollar
amount
in
then
an
organization
under
the
dollar
amount
might
devote
a
hundred
percent
to
it
whereas
a
bigger
organization
would
be
only
devoting
a
fraction
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
about
the
best
test
congress
could
device.
i
might
close,
i’m
concerned
about
my
time,
i
haven’t
seen
the
light,
but
we’d
like
to
say
that
while
we’re
not
unsympathetic
with
the
problem
of
the
americans
united
has,
we
believe
the
solution
is
on
legislation.
we
believe
that
solution
is
coming.
their
judicial
review
of
this
type
of
a
problem
is
presently
being
considered
in
the
field
of
pension
plans.
in
hr
4200,
93rd
congress,
the
first
session
in
section
601,
they
are
providing
for
or
al
least
proposed
to
provide
for
an
appeal
to
the
tax
court
from
rulings
in
the
pension
field.
i
understand
this
act
has
passed
both
houses
and
is
in
conference,
but
not
on
this
point.
the
section
--
a
committee
of
the
section
of
taxation
is
considering
a
similar
--
it
wouldn’t
affect
this
case.
no,
but
it
will
affect
future
if
this
is
enacted.
it
will
be
in
effect
the
exempt
organization.
but
a
committee
of
the
section
of
taxation
in
american
bar
association
is
presently
considering
whether
a
similar
recommendation
should
be
made
in
the
field
of
exempt
organizations.
that
isn't
cited
in
our
briefs,
but
you
can
find
a
reference
to
that
in
26
the
tax
lawyer
at
page
628.
it
seems
to
us
that
it’s
clearly
the
scope
of
this
legislation
is
to
be
determined
by
congress
and
we
submit
that
that’s
where
the
relief,
if
any,
should
be
and
not
by
seeking
a
judicial
remedy
here
which
in
our
view
the
statutes
just
did
not
provide
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
thank
you.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
thought
of
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
answer
with
a
little
--
in
a
little
more
detail
the
question
which
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
me
about
whether
or
not
returns
are
required.
i
knew
that
annual
returns
were
required,
but
i
wasn’t
concerned
--
i
didn’t,
my
recollection
wasn’t
too
clear
on
just
what
was
required
in
those
returns
as
to
the
continuing
of
material
relating
to
continued
tax
exemption.
i
am
now
advised
that
you
are
required
to
state
whether
or
not
you
have
made
any
change
in
your
activities,
but
other
than
that,
the
return
is
one
of
financial
information
and
of
course,
it
would
not
catch
a
situation
or
trigger
a
situation
where
perhaps
the
commissioner
has
changed
his
view
as
to
situations
such
that
might
have
here.
i’d
like
to
reply
very
briefly
to
counsel
suggestion
that
the
size
of
the
employment
taxes
has
some
factor.
i
don’t
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
it
at
all.
he
can
sue
for
$10
and
in
that
proceeding
argued
that
he
is
an
exempt
--
he
represents
an
organization
exempt
under
501
(c)
(3)
and
i
think
had
he
done
so,
this
question
would
have
been
decided
by
and
now
and
has
been
decided
on
its
merits.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
he
wants
a
determination
that
he
is
an
exempt
organization
and
i
think
he
would
have
gotten
it
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
because
i
think
to
get
the
refund
of
employment
taxes
the
court
would
there
to
determine
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
--
that
the
an
organization
is
exempt
under
501
(c)
(3).
now
to
the
extent
that
he
may
say
--
be
saying,
“i
want
to
do
something
for
other
organizations,”
our
position
is
that’s
not
the
case
here.
we’re
talking
about
“americans
united.”
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
as
to
future
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
they
would
and
i
think
that’s
their
policy
and
we
certainly
would
--
assuming
the
organization
continued
to
operate
the
same
way
in
later
years
that
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
test
case,
i
think
that
would
be
a
complete
answer
and
they
put
their
name
back.
they
do
require
them
to
file
an
application.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
the
way
the
procedure
that
they
have
is
the
irs
after
case
like
that
ask
you
to
submit
an
application
referring
to
the
case
as
the
reason
for
that
you’re
now
qualified
as
tax-exempt
organization.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
and
they
would
then
put
your
name
back
on
the
list.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think
that’s
right,
your
honor,
but
i
think
you
could
assume
a
good
faith
with
the
government
in
a
situation
like
that.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
am
not
sure
of
that
question,
your
honor.
i
know
they
can
under
social
security
taxes,
whether
they
can
under
employment
taxes,
i
don’t
know.
i
would
like
to
comment
just
briefly
on
the
allen
case.
in
that
situation,
the
university
of
georgia
was
a
collector
of
taxes.
it
was
not
a
taxpayer
and
so
it
had
not
means
of
independent
judicial
review
and
i
think
that
completely
distinguishes
that
case.
and
if
all
that
the
respondent
wants
is
a
determination
of
the
word
“substantial”
should
be
read
out
of
section
501
(c)
(3),
we
think
they
could
have
had
that
holding
if
their
right
made
in
a
refund
suit
and
that’s
the
place
to
do
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
it’s
our
view
that
it
would
because
that
suit
would
be
based
on
the
theory
that
we
are
an
exempt
organization
under
section
501
(c)
(3)
and
therefore
we
don’t
have
to
pay
the
futa
taxes
and
if
the
court
agreed
with
them,
you’d
have
a
determination
that
it
was
an
exempt
organization.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
yes.
