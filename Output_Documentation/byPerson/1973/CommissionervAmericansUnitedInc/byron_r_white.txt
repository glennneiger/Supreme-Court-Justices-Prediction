justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
they
might
not
need
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
otherwise,
i
mean
otherwise,
there’s
no
need
to
bar
an
injunction
unless
there’s
irreparable
injury.
justice
byron
r.
white
furthermore,
you
couldn’t
collect
certain
kinds
of
taxes
from
the
organization
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
federal
unemployment
taxes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
commissioner’s
action
stands
you
can
collect
it
--
federal
unemployment
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
injunction
stands,
you
cannot?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
the
organization
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
does
the
government
take
a
position
that
the
anti-injunction
act
has
the
same
impact
as
28
u.s.c.
2201?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
declaratory
judgments?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
think
the
prohibition
against
declaratory
judgments
is
any
broader
or
any
narrower
than
the
prohibition
against
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
want
to
know
--
i
want
to
know
what
the
government’s
position
is
with
respect
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don’t
you
have
to
have
in
effect
the
declaratory
judgment
before
you
can
have
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
has
to
be
some
legal
basis,
some
legal
basis
for
the
injunction.
i
mean
some
--
some
right
to
the
injunction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
may
not
have
some
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
many
not
have
something
called
a
declaratory
judgment
now,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
sued
for
refund
of
the
ones
you
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
sued
for
refund
of
your
futa
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
could
raise
this
for
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whether
--
whether
that
is
so
or
not,
is
it
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
could
have
raised
this
very
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
your
futa
taxes
were
validly
collected?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
trouble
is
that’s
the
very
purpose
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
is
not
as
to
put
off
to
refund
suits
the
decisions
of
questions
like
these?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
--
don’t
you
think
the
absence
of
any
alternative
remedy
was
an
important
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
don’t
know
what
it
would
have
done
if
the
issue
have
been
before
it
about
the
futa
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
rather
odd,
isn’t
it?
i
mean,
isn’t
it
because
you
could
have
had
that
decision,
you
could
have
this
very
issue
decided
in
the
refund
actually?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
that
the
issue
hadn’t
been
--
wasn’t
raised
until
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
there
been
any
judicial
constructions
of
it
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
government
apparently
thinks
that
it’s
broader.
it
doesn’t
concede
that
it’s
co-terminus
with
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
alright
i’ll
get
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can’t
say
there’s
no
other
remedy
available
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
didn’t
used
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
the
commissioner
forced
you
to
confer
this
to
employees,
you
weren’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
true
that
he
wants
something
more
than
get
a
refund
of
that
unemployment
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
has
many
--
much
broader
tax
implication
than
just
the
refund
of
the
employment
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
until
this
revocation
americans
united
did
not
pay
futa
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that’s
what
triggered
the
payment
of
futa
taxes?
justice
byron

what’s
the
