justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
i
gather
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
below,
i
gather
also
in
the
next
case,
the
court
in
that
case
was
that
really
neither
a
declaratory
judgment
nor
any
restraint
against
the
collection
of
taxes
has
been
sought,
but
that
we
have
to
read
these
proceedings
as
an
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
substantiality
exception.
and
that
that
involves
ninth
--
and
an
injunction
against
its
enforcement,
but
that
such
an
injunction
involves
neither
a
declaratory
judgment
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
nor
an
injunction
within
74
whatever
that.
it’s
not
that
--
that’s
in
effect
what
they
held,
didn’t
it?
do
i
read
the
opinions
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
but
surely
i’m
right
that
they
are
trying
to
get
around
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
say
that
this
was
neither?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn’t
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
that’s
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
isn't
that
the
rather
narrow
question
that
we
have
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
that
the
concurrence
of
this
opinion
was
a
model
of
lucidity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
on
the
substantiality
point,
in
a
practical
world
it’s
true,
isn’t
it?
organizations
opposed
to
the
point
of
view
of
this
one,
not
by
reason
of
their
greater
means
of
--
are
not
devoting
a
substantial
part
of
their
time
and
effort
to
lobbying,
but
it
may
be
if
not
a
substantial
part
but
in
the
aggregate
get
it
so
much
greater
part.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
is
this
--
what
this
organization
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
question
involved
in
bob
case?
did
bob
jones
university
also
have
available
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
look
down
on
such
as
in
the
exclusion
rather
than
the
declarative
judgments
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

co-terminus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
language,
it
certainly
seems
broader,
doesn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
you
have
to
take
that
position,
don’t
you
because
with
respect
to
taxes,
that’s
the
word
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

unemployment
taxes,
if
they
were
exempt
would
they
be
able
to
pay
those
voluntarily
and
cover
their
employees?
if
they
were
exempt
in
section
3,
organization?
