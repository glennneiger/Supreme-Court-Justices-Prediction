mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
as
the
former
house
counsel
and
litigation
attorney
for
americans
united
for
separation
of
church
and
state,
i
appear
before
you
to
argue
that
the
decision
of
the
a
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
upholding
the
right
of
americans
united
to
its
day
in
court
was
correct
and
should
be
upheld.
my
share
in
the
oral
argument
is
to
emphasize
just
a
few
points
which
makes
clear
that
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
which
holds
that
this
case
does
raise
a
substantial
constitutional
question
should
be
upheld.
i
fear
that
the
commissioner’s
counsel
have
misstated
inadvertently
the
legal
question
presented
where
in
their
brief
they
say
the
question
presented
is
“whether
the
respondent
is
barred
by
the
anti-injunction
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act
or
otherwise
from
obtaining
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
requiring
the
commissioner
to
issue
a
ruling
that
respondent
is
exempt
from
section
501
(c)
(3)
and
therefore
the
contributions
to
it
are
deductible
under
code
section
170
(c)
(2).
americans
united
has
never
argued
that
the
commissioner
should
rule
that
it
is
exempt
under
501
(c)
(3).
americans
united
has
sought
to
have
the
substantiality
clause
of
501
(c)
(3)
ruled
unconstitutional
expunged
as
it
were
from
501
(c)
(3).
thus,
directed
the
commissioner
could
and
should
exercise
his
discretion
and
determine
the
eligibility
of
americans
united
for
continuing
treatment
under
501
(c)
(3).
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
the
clause
has
many
other
qualifications
for
501
(c)
(3)
status
is
very
complicated
and
we
feel
that
we
could
qualify
on
all
of
them.
we
can’t
qualify
and
don’t
want
to
qualify
if
it
means
we
can’t
either
come
to
this
court
to
present
cases
or
we
can’t
go
to
congress
and
say
that
well
the
constitution
is
great
and
we
want
it
kept
that
way.
the
existence
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
well,
insofar
as
it
states
that
we
have
--
that
i
think
means
that
we
have
a
substantial
constitutional
question
involved
and
because
the
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
yes,
i
think
it
might
be
either
way.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
think
the
case
that
held
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
government
prevail
in
a
lawsuit
is
not
good
law
and
not
applicable
to
us
because
anybody
can
prevail.
it
is
not
a
good
standard.
the
enochs
case,
the
organization
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
yes,
i’m
hoping
that
judges
at
this
time
will
not
so
feel.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
no,
in
enochs,
the
organization
owed
a
tax.
now,
we
agree
that
if
americans
united
owed
a
tax,
that
we
should
have
paid
the
tax
and
then
gone
into
the
tax
court
and
sued
to
have
it
refunded,
but
we
don’t
have
any
such
tax
owed.
now,
way
at
the
end
of
the
whole
proceedings
it
was
suggested
we
could
in
effect
deprive
our
employees
of
their
rights
under
futa,
the
unemployment
compensation
act,
sue
to
get
the
money
back
and
then
go
in
and
not
argue
about
that,
argue
about
our
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
no,
no.
we
weren’t
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
but
from
that
day
on
we’ve
paid
--
we’ve
paid
their
unemployment
tax
and
we
would
continue
paying
that
tax
even
if
we
win
this
case
because
that’s
a
benefit
to
our
employees.
if
--
they
are
likely
to
lose
their
jobs
because
of
the
impact
of
this
ruling,
and
they
need
that
unemployment
tax.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
well,
it
is
i
think
if
your
honors
will
consider
the
remedy
that
we
should
not
pay
a
tax
which
we
want
to
pay.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
no,
but
i
don’t
think
we
will.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i’m
not
quite
certain,
but
i
don’t
think
we
were
eligible
to
pay
it
before.
once
we
changed
our
status
then
our
employees
could
obtain
unemployment
compensation
under
this
act.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
this
could
very
well
be
true.
now
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
revoked
the
privilege
of
americans
united
to
continue
soliciting
donors
who
in
turn
could
make
their
donations
out
of
pretext
income
and
the
reason
given
is
that
americans
united
total
activity
is
one
of
legislative
effort.
if
we
file
our
brief
amicus
with
this
--
before
this
court
which
we
do
quite
--
which
we
used
to
do
anyway
quite
frequently,
they
say
it’s
an
intent
to
influence
the
legislation
because
we
take
a
stand.
if
we
pray
as
agreed
opinion
like
everson
versus
the
board
of
education
it
isn’t
according
to
irs
an
attempt
to
influence
legislation
because
we
favor
the
opinion.
if
we
republished
james
madison’s
memorial
and
remonstrance,
it
is
an
attempt
to
influence
legislation.
everything
we
do
according
to
the
letters
we
have
from
irs
is
an
attempt
to
influence
legislation.
the
result
is
a
penalty
for
the
exercise
of
our
first
amendment
rights.
we
remain
tax
exempt.
that’s
not
a
right.
that’s
a
privilege
but
we
are
denied
the
support
of
our
donors
which
is
not
a
privilege
but
a
right.
these
donors
are
still
free
to
make
tax-exempt
donations
to
other
charities
and
other
causes
but
not
to
the
one
of
the
greatest
causes
of
all,
the
preservation
of
the
principal
separation
of
church
and
state
and
the
cause
dear
to
our
donors
and
a
cause
dear
the
merits
of
this
court.
it
must
be
remembered
also
that
in
our
argument,
americans
united
actually
is
arguing
that
no
organization,
not
even
the
roman
catholic
church
with
its
unlimited
resources
constantly
used
for
lobbying
should
be
put
to
the
test
of
the
substantiality
clause
of
501
(c)
(3).
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
as
i
read
the
revocation
letters.
one
of
the
--
we’ve
had
a
whole
series.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
was
shocked
when
we
got
the
letter.
i
was
the
attorney
that
had
to
try
to
keep
compliance,
but
i
gave
up
on
trying
to
see
that
absolutely
no
legislative
efforts
were
made.
when
they
came
back
to
me
and
said
that
everything
you
do
is
--
it
influences
legislation.
i
presume
that
this
case
will
be
reported
and
that
will
influence
legislation.
that
is
a
deprivation
of
our
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
we
haven’t
had
a
big
enough
record
because
we
haven’t
had
a
chance
to
get
into
the
court,
but
that
is
what
we
will
prove
in
the
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
am
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
will
prove
that
the
effect
of
their
letters
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
the
counsel
would
be
because
they
say
that’s
an
action
organization.
now,
they
are
changing
their
position
on
that
particular
point,
i
think,
due
to
various
pressures.
but
they
still
indicate
that
if
we
were
to
be
--
as
we’re
constantly
doing
--
going
before
the
congress
at
the
request
of
the
congress
to
say
what
we
think
about
the
first
amendment.
they
say
that
influences
legislation
and
it
probably
does.
but
we
say
we
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
influence
legislation.
now,
i
notice
that
the
time
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
thank
you.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
will
just
take
two
minutes
to
sort
of
finish
what
i
would
have
finished
before
lunch.
it’s
more
of
a
peroration,
but
when
we
have
our
day
in
court
on
the
merits
of
this
case,
we
will
show
that
the
501
(c)
(3)
as
presently
written
with
its
substantiality
cast
in
its
propaganda
bar
permit
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
in
fact,
invite
him
to
tear
out
the
heart
of
unpopular
causes,
unpopular
to
him
or
unpopular
to
the
particular
personnel
on
the
irs
handling
the
case.
and
it
does
tear
out
the
heart
of
our
organization,
americans
united
for
the
separation
for
church
and
state
and
we
have
suffered
irreparable
damage
already.
a
$90,000
loss
in
1972,
over
$200,000
loss
in
1973,
the
backlog
of
gifts
which
we
had
which
permitted
our
appearance
before
this
court
so
many
times
will
soon
be
decapitated.
already,
the
staff
has
been
cut
from
43
to
28.
our
mailing
list,
when
we
sent
out
the
educational
materials
explaining
to
the
people
what
this
court
holds
on
separation
of
church
and
state,
has
been
cut
from
200,000
to
a
132,000.
no
longer
has
americans
united
a
full
time
counsel
for
litigation.
this
litigation
is
handled
on
an
uncompensated
basis
by
mr.
morrison
and
myself.
surely,
a
substantial
constitutional
question
is
raised
when
a
statute
is
interpreted
to
permit
and
indeed
to
invite
the
stifle
free
speech
to
stop
those
seeking
a
redress
of
grievances
before
congress
and
before
the
courts.
no
briefs
amicus
had
been
filed
with
this
court
by
americans
united
since
the
revocation.
no
litigation
has
taken
place
bearing
our
name
as
plaintiffs
before
the
federal
court.
our
abilities
to
preserve
the
principle
of
separation
of
church
and
state
through
education
and
litigation
and
perhaps
bringing
our
points
to
congress
has
been
cut
out.
we
asked
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
be
upheld
and
on
behalf
of
those
who
dedicate
their
lives
to
religious
liberty,
both
catholics
and
protestants
alike,
we
thank
you
for
this
opportunity
to
present
our
views
to
you
in
whose
hands
religious
liberty
has
faired
so
well
in
this
county.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
as
the
former
house
counsel
and
litigation
attorney
for
americans
united
for
separation
of
church
and
state,
i
appear
before
you
to
argue
that
the
decision
of
the
a
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
upholding
the
right
of
americans
united
to
its
day
in
court
was
correct
and
should
be
upheld.
my
share
in
the
oral
argument
is
to
emphasize
just
a
few
points
which
makes
clear
that
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
which
holds
that
this
case
does
raise
a
substantial
constitutional
question
should
be
upheld.
i
fear
that
the
commissioner’s
counsel
have
misstated
inadvertently
the
legal
question
presented
where
in
their
brief
they
say
the
question
presented
is
“whether
the
respondent
is
barred
by
the
anti-injunction
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act
or
otherwise
from
obtaining
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
requiring
the
commissioner
to
issue
a
ruling
that
respondent
is
exempt
from
section
501
(c)
(3)
and
therefore
the
contributions
to
it
are
deductible
under
code
section
170
(c)
(2).
americans
united
has
never
argued
that
the
commissioner
should
rule
that
it
is
exempt
under
501
(c)
(3).
americans
united
has
sought
to
have
the
substantiality
clause
of
501
(c)
(3)
ruled
unconstitutional
expunged
as
it
were
from
501
(c)
(3).
thus,
directed
the
commissioner
could
and
should
exercise
his
discretion
and
determine
the
eligibility
of
americans
united
for
continuing
treatment
under
501
(c)
(3).
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
the
clause
has
many
other
qualifications
for
501
(c)
(3)
status
is
very
complicated
and
we
feel
that
we
could
qualify
on
all
of
them.
we
can’t
qualify
and
don’t
want
to
qualify
if
it
means
we
can’t
either
come
to
this
court
to
present
cases
or
we
can’t
go
to
congress
and
say
that
well
the
constitution
is
great
and
we
want
it
kept
that
way.
the
existence
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
well,
insofar
as
it
states
that
we
have
--
that
i
think
means
that
we
have
a
substantial
constitutional
question
involved
and
because
the
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
yes,
i
think
it
might
be
either
way.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
think
the
case
that
held
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
government
prevail
in
a
lawsuit
is
not
good
law
and
not
applicable
to
us
because
anybody
can
prevail.
it
is
not
a
good
standard.
the
enochs
case,
the
organization
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
yes,
i’m
hoping
that
judges
at
this
time
will
not
so
feel.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
no,
in
enochs,
the
organization
owed
a
tax.
now,
we
agree
that
if
americans
united
owed
a
tax,
that
we
should
have
paid
the
tax
and
then
gone
into
the
tax
court
and
sued
to
have
it
refunded,
but
we
don’t
have
any
such
tax
owed.
now,
way
at
the
end
of
the
whole
proceedings
it
was
suggested
we
could
in
effect
deprive
our
employees
of
their
rights
under
futa,
the
unemployment
compensation
act,
sue
to
get
the
money
back
and
then
go
in
and
not
argue
about
that,
argue
about
our
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
no,
no.
we
weren’t
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
but
from
that
day
on
we’ve
paid
--
we’ve
paid
their
unemployment
tax
and
we
would
continue
paying
that
tax
even
if
we
win
this
case
because
that’s
a
benefit
to
our
employees.
if
--
they
are
likely
to
lose
their
jobs
because
of
the
impact
of
this
ruling,
and
they
need
that
unemployment
tax.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
well,
it
is
i
think
if
your
honors
will
consider
the
remedy
that
we
should
not
pay
a
tax
which
we
want
to
pay.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
no,
but
i
don’t
think
we
will.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i’m
not
quite
certain,
but
i
don’t
think
we
were
eligible
to
pay
it
before.
once
we
changed
our
status
then
our
employees
could
obtain
unemployment
compensation
under
this
act.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
this
could
very
well
be
true.
now
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
revoked
the
privilege
of
americans
united
to
continue
soliciting
donors
who
in
turn
could
make
their
donations
out
of
pretext
income
and
the
reason
given
is
that
americans

total

is

if
we
file
our

the

is

we
remain

that’s
not
a

that’s
a
privilege
but
we
are
denied
the
support
of
our
donors
which
is
not
a
privilege
but
a
right.
these
donors
are
still
free
to
make
tax-exempt
donations
to
other
charities
and
other
causes
but
not
to
the
one
of
the
greatest
causes
of
all,
the
preservation
of
the
principal
separation
of
church
and
state
and
the
cause
dear
to
our
donors
and
a
cause
dear
the
merits
of
this
court.
it
must
be
remembered
also
that
in
our
argument,
americans
united
actually
is
arguing
that
no
organization,
not
even
the
roman
catholic
church
with
its
unlimited
resources
constantly
used
for
lobbying
should
be
put
to
the
test
of
the
substantiality
clause
of
501
(c)
(3).

franklin

salisbury
as
i
read
the
revocation
letters.
one
of
the
--
we’ve
had
a
whole
series.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
was
shocked
when
we
got
the
letter.
i
was
the
attorney
that
had
to
try
to
keep
compliance,
but
i
gave
up
on
trying
to
see
that
absolutely
no
legislative
efforts
were
made.
when
they
came
back
to
me
and
said
that
everything
you
do
is
--
it
influences
legislation.
i
presume
that
this
case
will
be
reported
and
that
will
influence
legislation.
that
is
a
deprivation
of
our
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
we
haven’t
had
a
big
enough
record
because
we
haven’t
had
a
chance
to
get
into
the
court,
but
that
is
what
we
will
prove
in
the
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
am
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
will
prove
that
the
effect
of
their
letters
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
the
counsel
would
be
because
they
say
that’s
an
action
organization.
now,
they
are
changing
their
position
on
that
particular
point,
i
think,
due
to
various
pressures.
but
they
still
indicate
that
if
we
were
to
be
--
as
we’re
constantly
doing
--
going
before
the
congress
at
the
request
of
the
congress
to
say
what
we
think
about
the
first
amendment.
they
say
that
influences
legislation
and
it
probably
does.
but
we
say
we
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
influence
legislation.
now,
i
notice
that
the
time
--
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
thank
you.
mr.
franklin
c.
salisbury
i
will
just
take
two
minutes
to
sort
of
finish
what
i
would
have
finished
before
lunch.
it’s
more
of
a
peroration,
but
when
we
have
our
day
in
court
on
the
merits
of
this
case,
we
will
show
that
the
501
(c)
(3)
as
presently
written
with
its
substantiality
cast
in
its
propaganda
bar
permit
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
in
fact,
invite
him
to
tear
out
the
heart
of
unpopular
causes,
unpopular
to
him
or
unpopular
to
the
particular
personnel
on
the
irs
handling
the
case.
and
it
does
tear
out
the
heart
of
our
organization,
americans
united
for
the
separation
for
church
and
state
and
we
have
suffered
irreparable
damage
already.
a
$90,000
loss
in
1972,
over
$200,000
loss
in
1973,
the
backlog
of
gifts
which
we
had
which
permitted
our
appearance
before
this
court
so
many
times
will
soon
be
decapitated.
already,
the
staff
has
been
cut
from
43
to
28.
our
mailing
list,
when
we
sent
out
the
educational
materials
explaining
to
the
people
what
this
court
holds
on
separation
of
church
and
state,
has
been
cut
from
200,000
to
a
132,000.
no
longer
has
americans
united
a
full
time
counsel
for
litigation.
this
litigation
is
handled
on
an
uncompensated
basis
by
mr.
morrison
and
myself.
surely,
a
substantial
constitutional
question
is
raised
when
a
statute
is
interpreted
to
permit
and
indeed
to
invite
the
stifle
free
speech
to
stop
those
seeking
a
redress
of
grievances
before
congress
and
before
the
courts.
no
briefs
amicus
had
been
filed
with
this
court
by
americans
united
since
the
revocation.
no
litigation
has
taken
place
bearing
our
name
as
plaintiffs
before
the
federal
court.
our
abilities
to
preserve
the
principle
of
separation
of
church
and
state
through
education
and
litigation
and
perhaps
bringing
our
points
to
congress
has
been
cut
out.
we
asked
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
be
upheld
and
on
behalf
of
those
who
dedicate
their
lives
to
religious
liberty,
both
catholics
and
protestants
alike,
we
thank
you
for
this
opportunity
to
present
our
views
to
you
in
whose
hands
religious
liberty
has
faired
so
well
in
this
county.
