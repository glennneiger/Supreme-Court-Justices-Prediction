e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
72-1254,
joseph
smith
against
goguen.
mr.
chase,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
will
take
us
just
to
about
termination
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
dispute
in
this
case
is
to
whether
this
was
a
flag?
i
missed
if
it
were
in
the
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
not
disputed
that
this
had
the
requisite
number
of
stars
and
stripes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there
are
quite
a
number
of
contemptuous
acts
as
the
term
you
used
that
may
go
unprosecuted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
the
acts
which
may
be
subject
to
a
particular
statute
are
not
necessarily
the
subject
of
a
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
let
you
begin
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
at
10
o’clock
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
number
1254.
mr.
chase.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me
mr.
lawson,
our
order
is
on
the
order
list
sequence
of
yesterday.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
the
extent
it’s
important.
we
must
take
the
record
as
it
comes
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thus,
there
are
ways
that
you
could
have
corrected
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
is
no
statute
about
black
armbands,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
some
statutes
prohibiting
i
think
the
use
of
the
certain
seals
for
commercial
purposes
for
example,
would
you
regard
that
an
impingement
of
first
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
because
it’s
a
commercial,
a
restraint
on
commercial
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
think
that’s
all
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
and
what
you’re
telling
us
really
is
there
is
no
harm
in
wearing
the
flag
on
the
seat
of
your
(inaudible)
but
there
is
harm
in
having
seal
of
the
united
states
used
in
a
commercial
enterprise.
let’s
say
on
a
pawnshop
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
start
selling
girly
magazines?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that’s
the
only
harm
you
see
in
it.
it
isn’t
the
matter
of
the
contempt
development?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
denigration.
there
is
no
denigration
factor
in
your
mind
in
that
analysis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
lawson.
you
have
few
minutes
left
mr.
chase.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
mean
that
the
prosecution
in
this
case
would
have
had
burden
of
showing
what
instructions
were
given
if
they
were
resting
on
the
proposition
that
the
rejected
instructions
were
redundant
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
sure
you
want
to
answer
yes
to
that?
if
you
have
got
an
appellant
that’s
trying
to
show
the
instruction
was
erroneously
refused.
might
it
not
be
up
to
him
to
show
not
only
the
instruction
was
refused
but
that
it
was
not
covered
by
other
instructions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
one
more
question,
general
chase.
i
might
take
it
that
your
argument
is
in
part
at
least
that
whatever
communication
was
involved
here
in
the
acts
of
the
respondent,
it
was
communication
by
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
disposition
in

72-1254,
smith

goguen

72-1264,
