mr.
charles
e.
chase
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
charles
chase
and
i’m
an
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
this
time,
i
would
like
to
with
the
leave
of
court
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
argument
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
alright.
your
honors,
this
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
which
that
court
ruled
that
the
massachusetts
flag
statute
was
vague
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
overly
broad
in
violation
of
first
amendment.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
on
january
30,
1970,
valerie
goguen
was
seen
on
the
main
street
leominster
massachusetts
with
a
small
american
flag
approximately
three
by
five
inches
or
four
by
six
inches
sewn
to
the
seat
of
his
pants
in
the
area
of
the
left
buttock.
a
police
officer
saw
him
standing
on
the
streets
of
leominster
and
saw
a
crowd
of
people
with
him.
the
police
officer
approached
him
and
spoke
to
him
about
the
flag.
thereafter
the
police
officer
went
to
the
leominster
district
court
and
swore
out
a
complaint
charging
that
valerie
goguen
did
treat
contemptuously
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
mr.
goguen
was
tried
in
the
local
district
court
and
found
guilty
by
a
judge.
he
exercised
his
right
for
a
trial
de
novo
to
worcester
superior
court.
a
trial
was
had
before
a
jury
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
mr.
goguen
was
sentence
to
six
months
in
the
house
of
correction.
execution
of
this
sentence
was
staid
pending
his
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court.
in
that
appeal
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
affirmed
the
conviction
unanimously
in
a
rescript
opinion.
after
that
in
february
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
as
it’s
used
in
massachusetts,
i
believe
it's
equivalent
to
a
per
curiam
opinion,
a
short
brief
opinion
in
which
the
issues
are
not
discussed
at
length.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
what
section
of
the
state?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
the
flag
statute
your
honor?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that
is
located
approximately
30
or
40
miles
northwest
of
boston.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
fairly
small
town.
i
would
believe
probably
30,000
or
40,000
people
now.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
not
that
we
can
gleam
from
the
record.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
the
only
thing
the
record
–-
mr.
charles
e.
chase
apparently,
your
honor.
it’s
unclear
as
to
what
exactly
he
was
doing
other
than
he
was
on
the
public
streets
of
leominster.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor
i
can
not
give
any
more
than
what
it’s
in
that
record
at
this
moment.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor,
may
i
say
that
our
office
became
involved
when
the
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed.
i
believe
my
brother
represented
him
at
the
superior
court
jury
trial
and
possibly
he
could
enlighten
the
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
you
have
the
entire
record
before,
your
honor,
in
the
appendix.
by
the
way,
it
is
just
a
seven-page.
it
fills
seven
pages
of
the
appendix
that
is
the
entire
appellate
record.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
all
i
know
of
your
honor.
that’s
all
that
the
federal
courts
had
when
they
decided
this
question.
on
february
23,
1972,
we
filed
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
in
june
of
1972
the
district
court
judge
granted
the
writ
saying
or
finding
that
mr.
goguen’s
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
according
to
the
statute.
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
or
affirmed
the
granting
of
the
writ,
i’m
sorry.
the
first
point
i
would
press
to
this
court
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
goguen
properly
exhausted
his
available
state
remedies
in
this
case.
by
that
i
mean,
was
it
proper
for
the
first
circuit
to
reach
a
facial
vagueness
claim
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
record
and
briefs
that
were
filed
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
if
you
study
those
briefs
and
tie
them
in
with
the
short
record
it
becomes
quite
clear
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
statute
gives
fair
notice
of
the
conduct
it
proscribes
whether
or
not
that
question
was
raised
on
the
sjc.
it
becomes
clear
that
it
wasn’t
appellee
in
his
brief
to
this
court
tells
us
that
the
essence
of
a
fourteenth
amendment
vagueness
claim
is
whether
or
not
fair
notice
is
given
and
yet
if
you
look
at
the
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
you
will
not
see
a
single
case
cited
for
that
proposition.
you
will
not
see
an
argument
developed
along
those
lines.
i
do
not
deny
that
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights
many
times
vagueness
and
overbreadth
are
closely
connected
and
intertwined.
and
yet,
the
question
i
think
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
it
was
permissible
for
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
to
handle
this
case
in
the
way
it
did
relative
to
fourteenth
amendment
vagueness.
in
other
words,
if
you
look
at
the
sj
or
the
supreme
judicial
court
opinion,
you
will
see
that
they
said
simply
this,
“whatever
the
uncertainties
in
other
situations,
we
find
no
vagueness
in
the
statute
as
applied
here.”
so
the
question
becomes,
should
the
first
circuit
have
reached
a
facial
vagueness
argument
in
light
of
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
said?
i
think
it’s
a
question
of
exhaustion
in
not
standing
because
the
supreme
judicial
court
never
faced
the
question.
if
the
issue
had
impressed
to
them
and
they
had
said,
no
we
find
that
this
man
has
no
standing
to
raise
a
facial
vagueness
argument
then
the
first
circuit’s
opinion
would
have
been
in
line.
in
other
words,
a
discussion
of
standing
to
raise
facial
vagueness
but
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
never
entertained
an
argument
because
one
was
never
made
to
them.
accordingly,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
find
that
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
was
violated
when
the
first
circuit
court
reached
a
facial
vagueness
claim.
assuming
though
that
the
first
circuit
court
could
consider
a
facial
vagueness
claim
properly,
we
submit
that
that
issue
was
wrongly
decided
by
the
first
circuit
court.
we
say
that
because
of
the
following
reasons.
this
statute
when
you
consider
whether
or
not
it
is
vague
on
its
face
has
a
very
narrow
subject
matter.
it
deals
with
the
united
states
flags.
it’s
not
dealing
with
loitering
or
noise
or
annoyance,
it’s
dealing
with
flags.
now,
if
a
person
is
going
to
violate
this
statute
he
immediately
knows
if
he
wants
notice
as
to
what
conduct
this
statute
proscribes,
he
immediately
knows
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
flags.
now,
if
he
wants
to
stay
clear
of
violating
this
statute,
he
just
has
to
stay
clear
of
doing
something
to
united
states
flag.
so
the
subject
matter
of
this
statute
is
uniquely
narrow.
now,
we
think
that
that
takes
some
of
vagueness
away
from
the
phrase
“treats
contemptuously”
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
we
would
say
no,
it
applies
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
--
only
to
actual
flags
because
the
massachusetts
statute
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
the
american
flag
is
a
cloth
flag
of
certain
dimensions.
there
is
an
official
dimension
and
there
are
other
dimensions
commercial
flags
that
are
put
out
to
use
in
parades
and
what
not
that
there
are
varying
sizes
to
united
states
flag
but
it
is
a
cloth
flag
that
can
be
affixed
to
a
pole
--
[voice
overlap].
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
on
a
question
of
vagueness
we
have
to
look
to
see
what
the
authorities
in
massachusetts
have
said
about
this
the
statute
since
it
was
enacted
in
1899.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
on
cloth?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i
would
say
that,
what
the
average
citizen
would
surmise
or
appreciate
as
a
flag
--
if
the
average
citizen
would
consider
that
the
flag,
it
would
be
a
flag.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
the
statute
is
directed
at
united
states
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
it’s
directed
at
united
states
flag,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
by
definition
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
by
definition
it
would
not
be
because
the
flag
of
the
united
states
has
the
appropriate
number
of
stars
and
stripes.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
doesn’t
have
to
be
any
particular
flag,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
no,
your
honor,
in
the
trial
court,
the
only
dispute
was
whether
or
not
the
flag
had
to
be
official
by
way
of
size
whatever
the
official
flag
is
four
by
six
feet.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
it
was
a
miniature
flag
with
the
appropriate
number
of
stars
and
stripes.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
a
flag
expert.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
apparently,
he’s
some
sort
of
an
expert
on
flag,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
the
defense
at
that
time,
mr.
goguen
said
that
if
he
was
to
be
convicted
under
this
statute,
he
had
to
have
done
something
to
an
official
flag
and
the
definition
of
an
official
flag
by
presidential
resolution
or
proclamation
is
a
flag
of
a
certain
size.
it’s
a
number
of
feet,
i
believe
its
four
by
six
feet
and
the
judge
at
the
trial
court
denied
that
instruction
you
would
not
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
i
wasn’t
involved
at
that
case,
i
never
met
the
man
and
i
don’t
think
i’ve
ever
met
a
vexillologist
in
my
life.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
besides
the
fact,
that
this
statute
deals
with
the
unique
narrow
subject
matter,
namely
flags.
we
think
it’s
clear
from
the
supreme
judicial
court
opinion
that
one
must
also
show
that
the
person
that
who
is
to
be
convicted
under
such
a
statute
intended
to
violate
the
statute
and
we
think
that
the
question
or
the
point,
the
necessity
of
having
prove
intent,
again,
narrows
the
reach
of
this
statute.
inadvertent
or
careless
acts
are
not
proscribed
by
the
statutory
language.
again,
when
you
talk
about
the
vagueness
of
the
statute,
there
are
accepted
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
and
construction
which
easily
apply
to
the
words
of
the
statute.
by
the
way,
the
first
26
words
of
the
massachusetts
statute
are
directed
toward
flag
desecration.
the
remainder
of
the
statute
talks
about
commercial
uses.
a
commercial
misuse
of
the
flag,
and
those
first
26
words,
the
key
desecration
words
goes
something
like
this.
“whoever
publicly
mutilates,
tramples
upon,
defaces
or
treats
contemptuously
the
flag
of
the
united
states
is
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.”
we
urged
upon
the
first
circuit
court,
the
principle
that
when
specific
in
general
words
are
associated
with
one
another
in
a
statute,
the
more
general
words
take
on
the
color
or
the
specific
or
a
meaning
analogous
to
those
of
the
specific
words.
and
what
we
urged
upon
the
first
circuit
court
was
that
the
phrase
“treats
contemptuously”
is
directed
at
the
same
type
of
act
that
the
first
three
desecration
words
in
the
statute
are
directed
at,
namely
acts
that
physically
dishonor
the
flag
or
affect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
we
say
that
the
act
of
affixing
a
flag
to
that
part
of
the
anatomy
physically
dishonors
the
flag
in
the
common
estimation
of
people
in
this
country.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
proscribed
under
the
language
of
the
statute.
because
of
the
common
usage
of
flags
in
this
country,
because
of
what
an
individual
would
read
or
would
see
from
that
specific
act.
if
i
saw
you
with
a
flag
on
your
lapel,
i
wouldn’t
think
you
we’re
trying
to
treat
the
united
states
flag
contemptuously.
i
don’t
see
many
people
wearing
something
on
the
seat
of
their
pants
though
when
they
intend
to
give
honor
or
respect
to
it.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
certainly,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor
again,
i
think
that’s
a
fairly
neutral
act.
at
least
the
way
your
usage
in
costume
has
developed
in
this
country.
the
whole
history
of
this
country,
you
see
so
many
war
movies
where
the
military
vehicles
have
flags
affixed
to
them
to
designate
their
country
or
origin
and
then
you
see
in
this
country,
a
number
of
vehicles
with
flag
decals
and
whatnot.
it’s
common
accepted
usage.
in
that
act,
you
don’t
hear
people
jumping
up
and
down
and
saying,
well
that
act
is
pulling
out
the
flag
to
dishonor.
it
is
a
fairly
neutral
act.
you
can’t
tell
by
that
specific
conduct
what
exactly
the
person
intended
or
who
has
affixed
the
flag
to
the
bumper
or
to
the
rear
window
or
decal
and
whatnot.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor,
i
have
not
seen
any
bathing
suit
with
a
flag
but
i
would
think
that
if
an
entire
american
flag
was
on
bathing
suit,
if
it
was
on
the
posterior
side
as
the
facts
are
in
this
case,
then
it
would
be
proscribe
by
the
wearing
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
true
your
honor
and
of
course
i
haven’t
seen
any
instances
in
massachusetts
where
people
have
worn
flags
on
the
seat
of
their
pants.
anything
having
to
do
with
the
flag
at
least
in
the
greater
boston
area
gets
reported
as
this
case
was
rightly
reported.
the
first
circuit
seems
to
make
the
point
that
they
think
a
lot
of
conduct
that
may
or
may
not
be
proscribed
by
the
statute
has
sort
of
gone
by
the
boards
because
people
have
been
arrested
and
then
the
prosecution
wouldn’t
be
pressed
and
the
people's
rights
are
being
infringed
upon.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
that
is
just
a
fortuitous
conclusion.
any
conduct
involving
the
flag
receives
wide
publicity
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i
have
been
there
your
honor
many
times,
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
no,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
office
is
a
(inaudible)
which
is
the
area
for
speech
giving
in
whatnot
and
i
haven’t
seen
any
flag
desecration
at
all.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
no
i
cannot
point
to
any
other
authority
other
than
what
is
already
have
been
presented
to
the
court.
i
believe
i’ve
given
all
of
it
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
i
would
make
reference
though
to
a
certain
opinions
of
the
attorney
generals
of
massachusetts
over
the
years
which
indicate
that
we’re
dealing
with
flag
legislation
and
the
only
thing
that
the
statute
directs
itself
to,
are
actual
flags,
not
symbols
or
emblems
that
might
look
like
the
flag
or
whatnot.
additionally,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
term
flag
in
the
massachusetts’
statute
means
flags
in
contradistinction
to
many
of
the
other
statutes
that
the
courts
have
dealt
with
over
the
past
few
years.
many
flag
statutes
defined
the
flag
to
mean
not
only
the
actual
flag
but
stars
and
stripes
and
hats
or
emblems
or
symbols
or
whatnot
even
the
federal
flag
statute
gives
a
very
broad
definition
of
the
word
flag
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
this
is
the
first
case
dealing
with
the
flag
desecration
words
in
the
statute
that
does
has
arrived
at
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.,
the
only
case.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
this
is
the
only
case
i’m
aware
of
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
i’m
aware
of
none
other
than
this
one.
i
don’t
know
of
my
brother.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
i
didn’t
mean
to
confuse
you.
the
first
circuit
suggested
that
and
i
believe
it’s
sort
of
fortuitous
because
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i’m
unaware
of
any
your
honor.
the
most
recent
interpretation
of
the
statute
prior
to
this
opinion
is
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
richardson
in
1968
dealing
with
a
painting
where
there
was
a
swatch
sticker
in
the
place
of
the
stars.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
to
the
jurisdictional
state,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
circuit
also
spoke
about
first
amendment
overbreadth.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
true,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
district
court
judge
was
a
massachusetts’
judge.
he
was
just
then
appointed
to
the
federal
district
court
and
since
going
up
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
right,
your
honor,
yes.
i
would
think
that
that
matter
should
be
kept
in
mind
relative
to
the
exhaustion
point
that
we
made
initially.
it
seems
to
me
that
although
we
didn’t
press
exhaustion
before
judge
campbell,
we
presented
him
with
the
entire
state
court
record
with
the
understanding
as
usual
when
we
defend
federal
habeas
corpus
petitions
that
he
would
look
to
that
state
court
record
to
make
sure
that
the
man
is
being
pressed
before
him
had
been
raised
and
decided
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
massachusetts
what,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
they
certainly
have
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
this
is
the
only
case
we
know.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
right,
your
honor
and
i
think
the
point
that
should
be
borne
in
mind
is
that
the
first
circuit
court
didn’t
look
to
any
of
the
rescript
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court.
none
at
all,
they
didn’t
speak
about
intent,
they
didn’t
speak
about
the
narrow
definition
of
flag.
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
first
circuit’s
conclusions
on
first
amendment
overbreadth.
the
first
circuit
said
in
so
many
words
that
all
flag
conduct
is
closely
akin
to
pure
speech
very
close
in
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit.
i
think
that
many
courts
would
disagree
with
this.
if
you
start
from
that
starting
point
though
that
all
flag
conduct
is
closely
akin
to
pure
speech.
it’s
very
difficult
to
come
up
with
a
valid
state
reasons
as
to
why
this
legislation
is
not
directed
towards
the
first
amendment
in
conduct
under
the
first
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
though
that
from
the
citations
in
massachusetts’
opinion,
massachusetts’
opinion
recognized
two
interests
namely,
the
very
diffused
meaning
of
the
united
states
flag
for
all
american
citizens.
it
can’t
be
constricted
and
equated
to
a
promotion
of
patriotism
and
loyalty
as
the
first
circuit
said.
it’s
much
broader
than
that.
it
includes
that
but
it’s
so
much
broader
for
all
americans,
the
flag
means
so
much
to
--
we
constrict
and
restrict
the
meaning
of
the
flag
just
to
that
i
think
does
deserve
as
to
what
the
flag
means
for
americans.
number
two,
as
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
showed,
they
cited
halter,
they
cited
chaplinsky
and
they
cited
sutherland
v.
dewulf.
all
of
these
opinions
go
to
the
question
of
a
preservation
of
the
public
peace.
now,
i
know
this
court
has
said
say
in
cohen
versus
california
that
an
undifferentiated
fear
of
a
disturbance
is
not
enough
to
restrict
first
amendment
rights.
but
i
think
when
you
think
about
the
flag
and
when
you
think
about
the
various
states
that
have
passed
legislation
in
this
area,
i
think
the
determination
they
have
made
is
that
flag
desecration
is
the
type
of
conduct
that
per
se
is
likely
to
incite
a
breach
of
the
peace
and
i
think
that
though
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
before
you
that
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
was
going
to
occur,
i
don’t
think
that
goes
to
defeat
this
interest.
i
think
a
legislature
can
make
a
valid
determination
that
certain
types
of
conduct
are
so
offensive
to
normal
community
standards
that
they’re
very
likely
to
create
a
breach
of
the
peace
and
that
in
the
interest
of
the
welfare
of
the
community,
certain
types
of
conduct
can
be
proscribed
such
as
flag
desecration.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
address
myself
to
a
few
points
brought
out
by
my
brother
during
his
argument.
one
point
he
made
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
activity
involved
in
this
case
amounts
to
an
attack
on
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
and
it
takes
exception
with
that
phrase
physical
integrity.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that
is
the
phrase
i
basically
used
in
my
brief
but
it
is
not
a
sacrosanct
phrase,
it
doesn’t
exhaust
the
state
interest.
i
would
just
cite
this
court
to
the
opinion
of
hoffman
versus
united
states
445
fed.
2d
226
where
they
spoke
about
conduct
that
physically
dishonors
the
flag
and
i
think
probably
that
that
phrase
physically
dishonor
is
more
the
aspect
of
this
particular
case.
there
was
a
dishonoring
of
the
flag
and
it
was
a
physical
dishonoring
of
the
flag
because
of
affixing
of
the
flag
to
the
posterior
anatomy
of
this
particular
individual.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor
we
would
urge
the
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
and
that
was
the
phrasing
in
the
complaint.
yes,
your
honor.
treat
contemptuously.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
we
would
as
a
--
yes,
they
urge
upon
this
court.
we
accepted
principle
of
statutory
interpretation
which
is
one
been
recognized
in
massachusetts
that
when
specific
words
and
more
general
words
are
associated
with
each
other
in
a
statute.
the
more
general
words
take
on
the
color
and
connotation
of
the
more
specific
and
are
in
that
sense.
we
streak
it
to
the
meaning
of
the
more
specific
words.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
no,
your
honor
but
that
is
an
accepted
principle
of
statutory
construction
in
massachusetts
and
there
are
four
or
five
cases
in
our
brief
showing
that
principle
in
operation.
i
cannot
deny
that
they
didn’t
mention
that
principle
but
i
think
it’s
clear
that
the
phrase
“treats
contemptuously”
is
directed
at
acts
of
the
same
type,
the
same
nature
namely
acts
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
all
three
of
those
first
phrases
are
directed
towards
physical
acts,
acts
that
affect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
my
brother
also
made
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
sentence
in
this
case
would
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights.
but
a
chilling
effect
on
what?
the
conviction
here
hasn’t
outlawed
the
use
of
the
flag
in
any
manner
of
means.
it
has
said
that
facts
that
desecrate
the
flag
will
be
punished
but
there
are
many
other
acts
that
protesters,
if
they
want
to
use
the
flag,
they
can
use
the
flag
and
also
it’s
a
demonstration.
they
are
just
supposed
to
not
desecrate
that
flag.
they
can
speak
all
man
of
violating
contemptuous
opinions
about
it
as
the
supreme
judicial
court
noted
in
this
rescript
opinion.
it
cited
the
street
opinion
and
said
he
was
not
prosecuted
for
words.
it
took
note
that
words
no
matter
how
contemptuous
about
the
flag
are
not
prosecutable.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor
but
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
there
were
certain
acts
of
which
the
conduct
is
so
egregious
saying
you
do
not
have
to
go
into
any
surrounding
circumstances
at
all
for
man
of
common
intelligence
to
agree
that
this
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i
believe
it
did
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
they
had
to
find
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
treat
the
flag
contemptuously.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
rescript
opinion
and
my
understanding
of
the
rescript
is
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
will
require
the
prosecution
to
prove
intent
and
any
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
no,
your
honor,
you
have
the
entire
record
before
you
including
the
briefs
that
were
presented
to
the
supreme
judicial
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
you
may
have
what
was
before
the
supreme
judicial
court
your
honor.
i’m
not
entirely
sure
of
everything
that
was
before
the
massachusetts
trial
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
anything
that
is
contained
in
the
bill
of
exceptions.
anything
that
the
defendant
saves
for
argument
on
appeal.
in
other
words,
i
believe
my
brother
did
say
the
fact
that
two
instructions
were
refused
at
the
trial
but
i
believe
he
said
those
to
be
argued
before
the
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
but
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
this.
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
is
bound
by
the
bill
of
exceptions,
they
cannot
go
beyond
that
and
it
is
up
to
the
parties
in
the
court
below
to
make
sure
that
everything
is
relevant,
it
gets
into
the
amended
bill
of
exceptions
or
bill
of
exceptions.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor
i
would
just
say
this,
for
my
knowledge
of
how
court
appeals
are
taken
in
massachusetts
that
the
losing
party
has
the
burden
of
putting
the
material
in
the
record
that
is
going
up
on
the
bill
of
exceptions.
the
prosecution
has
no
burden
to
compile
that
bill
of
exceptions.
the
losing
party
does
and
then
they
get
together
and
confer
with
the
trial
judge
and
there
is
an
agreement
as
to
whether
or
not
everything
in
the
bill
of
exceptions
should
be
there.
and
it’s
generally
worked
out
by
agreement
with
the
trial
judge
in
both
sides
but
it’s
the
losing
party
who
has
the
initial
burden
of
going
forward
to
compile
the
bill
of
exceptions.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
i
want
to
thank
the
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
certainly,
your
honor.
that
is
the
basis
of
my
argument.
i
think
it
seems
there
is
quite
clear
that
whatever
communication
was
involved
could
have
come
through
much
more
clearly
with
some
words
which
would
not
have
been
prosecuted.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
charles
chase
and
i’m
an
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
this
time,
i
would
like
to
with
the
leave
of
court
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
argument
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
alright.
your
honors,
this
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
which
that
court
ruled
that
the
massachusetts
flag
statute
was
vague
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
overly
broad
in
violation
of
first
amendment.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
on
january
30,
1970,
valerie
goguen
was
seen
on
the
main
street
leominster
massachusetts
with
a
small
american
flag
approximately
three
by
five
inches
or
four
by
six
inches
sewn
to
the
seat
of
his
pants
in
the
area
of
the
left
buttock.
a
police
officer
saw
him
standing
on
the
streets
of
leominster
and
saw
a
crowd
of
people
with
him.
the
police
officer
approached
him
and
spoke
to
him
about
the
flag.
thereafter
the
police
officer
went
to
the
leominster
district
court
and
swore
out
a
complaint
charging
that
valerie
goguen
did
treat
contemptuously
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
mr.
goguen
was
tried
in
the
local
district
court
and
found
guilty
by
a
judge.
he
exercised
his
right
for
a
trial
de
novo
to
worcester
superior
court.
a
trial
was
had
before
a
jury
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
mr.
goguen
was
sentence
to
six
months
in
the
house
of
correction.
execution
of
this
sentence
was
staid
pending
his
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court.
in
that
appeal
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
affirmed
the
conviction
unanimously
in
a
rescript
opinion.
after
that
in
february
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
as
it’s
used
in
massachusetts,
i
believe
it's
equivalent
to
a
per
curiam
opinion,
a
short
brief
opinion
in
which
the
issues
are
not
discussed
at
length.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
what
section
of
the
state?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
the
flag
statute
your
honor?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that
is
located
approximately
30
or
40
miles
northwest
of
boston.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
fairly
small
town.
i
would
believe
probably
30,000
or
40,000
people
now.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
not
that
we
can
gleam
from
the
record.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
the
only
thing
the
record
–-
mr.
charles
e.
chase
apparently,
your
honor.
it’s
unclear
as
to
what
exactly
he
was
doing
other
than
he
was
on
the
public
streets
of
leominster.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor
i
can
not
give
any
more
than
what
it’s
in
that
record
at
this
moment.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor,
may
i
say
that
our
office
became
involved
when
the
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed.
i
believe
my
brother
represented
him
at
the
superior
court
jury
trial
and
possibly
he
could
enlighten
the
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
you
have
the
entire
record
before,
your
honor,
in
the
appendix.
by
the
way,
it
is
just
a
seven-page.
it
fills
seven
pages
of
the
appendix
that
is
the
entire
appellate
record.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
all
i
know
of
your
honor.
that’s
all
that
the
federal
courts
had
when
they
decided
this
question.
on
february
23,
1972,
we
filed
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
in
june
of
1972
the
district
court
judge
granted
the
writ
saying
or
finding
that
mr.
goguen’s
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
according
to
the
statute.
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
or
affirmed
the
granting
of
the
writ,
i’m
sorry.
the
first
point
i
would
press
to
this
court
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
goguen
properly
exhausted
his
available
state
remedies
in
this
case.
by
that
i
mean,
was
it
proper
for
the
first
circuit
to
reach
a
facial
vagueness
claim
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
record
and
briefs
that
were
filed
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
if
you
study
those
briefs
and
tie
them
in
with
the
short
record
it
becomes
quite
clear
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
statute
gives
fair
notice
of
the
conduct
it
proscribes
whether
or
not
that
question
was
raised
on
the
sjc.
it
becomes
clear
that
it
wasn’t
appellee
in
his
brief
to
this
court
tells
us
that
the
essence
of
a
fourteenth
amendment
vagueness
claim
is
whether
or
not
fair
notice
is
given
and
yet
if
you
look
at
the
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
you
will
not
see
a
single
case
cited
for
that
proposition.
you
will
not
see
an
argument
developed
along
those
lines.
i
do
not
deny
that
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights
many
times
vagueness
and
overbreadth
are
closely
connected
and
intertwined.
and
yet,
the
question
i
think
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
it
was
permissible
for
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
to
handle
this
case
in
the
way
it
did
relative
to
fourteenth
amendment
vagueness.
in
other
words,
if
you
look
at
the
sj
or
the
supreme
judicial
court
opinion,
you
will
see
that
they
said
simply
this,
“whatever
the
uncertainties
in
other
situations,
we
find
no
vagueness
in
the
statute
as
applied
here.”
so
the
question
becomes,
should
the
first
circuit
have
reached
a
facial
vagueness
argument
in
light
of
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
said?
i
think
it’s
a
question
of
exhaustion
in
not
standing
because
the
supreme
judicial
court
never
faced
the
question.
if
the
issue
had
impressed
to
them
and
they
had
said,
no
we
find
that
this
man
has
no
standing
to
raise
a
facial
vagueness
argument
then
the
first
circuit’s
opinion
would
have
been
in
line.
in
other
words,
a
discussion
of
standing
to
raise
facial
vagueness
but
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
never
entertained
an
argument
because
one
was
never
made
to
them.
accordingly,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
find
that
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
was
violated
when
the
first
circuit
court
reached
a
facial
vagueness
claim.
assuming
though
that
the
first
circuit
court
could
consider
a
facial
vagueness
claim
properly,
we
submit
that
that
issue
was
wrongly
decided
by
the
first
circuit
court.
we
say
that
because
of
the
following
reasons.
this
statute
when
you
consider
whether
or
not
it
is
vague
on
its
face
has
a
very
narrow
subject
matter.
it
deals
with
the
united
states
flags.
it’s
not
dealing
with
loitering
or
noise
or
annoyance,
it’s
dealing
with
flags.
now,
if
a
person
is
going
to
violate
this
statute
he
immediately
knows
if
he
wants
notice
as
to
what
conduct
this
statute
proscribes,
he
immediately
knows
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
flags.
now,
if
he
wants
to
stay
clear
of
violating
this
statute,
he
just
has
to
stay
clear
of
doing
something
to
united
states
flag.
so
the
subject
matter
of
this
statute
is
uniquely
narrow.
now,
we
think
that
that
takes
some
of
vagueness
away
from
the
phrase
“treats
contemptuously”
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
we
would
say
no,
it
applies
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
--
only
to
actual
flags
because
the
massachusetts
statute
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
the
american
flag
is
a
cloth
flag
of
certain
dimensions.
there
is
an
official
dimension
and
there
are
other
dimensions
commercial
flags
that
are
put
out
to
use
in
parades
and
what
not
that
there
are
varying
sizes
to
united
states
flag
but
it
is
a
cloth
flag
that
can
be
affixed
to
a
pole
--
[voice
overlap].
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
on
a
question
of
vagueness
we
have
to
look
to
see
what
the
authorities
in
massachusetts
have
said
about
this
the
statute
since
it
was
enacted
in
1899.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
on
cloth?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i
would
say
that,
what
the
average
citizen
would
surmise
or
appreciate
as
a
flag
--
if
the
average
citizen
would
consider
that
the
flag,
it
would
be
a
flag.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
the
statute
is
directed
at
united
states
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
it’s
directed
at
united
states
flag,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
by
definition
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
by
definition
it
would
not
be
because
the
flag
of
the
united
states
has
the
appropriate
number
of
stars
and
stripes.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
doesn’t
have
to
be
any
particular
flag,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
no,
your
honor,
in
the
trial
court,
the
only
dispute
was
whether
or
not
the
flag
had
to
be
official
by
way
of
size
whatever
the
official
flag
is
four
by
six
feet.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
it
was
a
miniature
flag
with
the
appropriate
number
of
stars
and
stripes.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
a
flag
expert.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
apparently,
he’s
some
sort
of
an
expert
on
flag,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
the
defense
at
that
time,
mr.
goguen
said
that
if
he
was
to
be
convicted
under
this
statute,
he
had
to
have
done
something
to
an
official
flag
and
the
definition
of
an
official
flag
by
presidential
resolution
or
proclamation
is
a
flag
of
a
certain
size.
it’s
a
number
of
feet,
i
believe
its
four
by
six
feet
and
the
judge
at
the
trial
court
denied
that
instruction
you
would
not
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
i
wasn’t
involved
at
that
case,
i
never
met
the
man
and
i
don’t
think
i’ve
ever
met
a
vexillologist
in
my
life.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
besides
the
fact,
that
this
statute
deals
with
the
unique
narrow
subject
matter,
namely
flags.
we
think
it’s
clear
from
the
supreme
judicial
court
opinion
that
one
must
also
show
that
the
person
that
who
is
to
be
convicted
under
such
a
statute
intended
to
violate
the
statute
and
we
think
that
the
question
or
the
point,
the
necessity
of
having
prove
intent,
again,
narrows
the
reach
of
this
statute.
inadvertent
or
careless
acts
are
not
proscribed
by
the
statutory
language.
again,
when
you
talk
about
the
vagueness
of
the
statute,
there
are
accepted
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
and
construction
which
easily
apply
to
the
words
of
the
statute.
by
the
way,
the
first
26
words
of
the
massachusetts
statute
are
directed
toward
flag
desecration.
the
remainder
of
the
statute
talks
about
commercial
uses.
a
commercial
misuse
of
the
flag,
and
those
first
26
words,
the
key
desecration
words
goes
something
like
this.
“whoever
publicly
mutilates,
tramples
upon,
defaces
or
treats
contemptuously
the
flag
of
the
united
states
is
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.”
we
urged
upon
the
first
circuit
court,
the
principle
that
when
specific
in
general
words
are
associated
with
one
another
in
a
statute,
the
more
general
words
take
on
the
color
or
the
specific
or
a
meaning
analogous
to
those
of
the
specific
words.
and
what
we
urged
upon
the
first
circuit
court
was
that
the
phrase
“treats
contemptuously”
is
directed
at
the
same
type
of
act
that
the
first
three
desecration
words
in
the
statute
are
directed
at,
namely
acts
that
physically
dishonor
the
flag
or
affect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
we
say
that
the
act
of
affixing
a
flag
to
that
part
of
the
anatomy
physically
dishonors
the
flag
in
the
common
estimation
of
people
in
this
country.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
proscribed
under
the
language
of
the
statute.
because
of
the
common
usage
of
flags
in
this
country,
because
of
what
an
individual
would
read
or
would
see
from
that
specific
act.
if
i
saw
you
with
a
flag
on
your
lapel,
i
wouldn’t
think
you
we’re
trying
to
treat
the
united
states
flag
contemptuously.
i
don’t
see
many
people
wearing
something
on
the
seat
of
their
pants
though
when
they
intend
to
give
honor
or
respect
to
it.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
certainly,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor
again,
i
think
that’s
a
fairly
neutral
act.
at
least
the
way
your
usage
in
costume
has
developed
in
this
country.
the
whole
history
of
this
country,
you
see
so
many
war
movies
where
the
military
vehicles
have
flags
affixed
to
them
to
designate
their
country
or
origin
and
then
you
see
in
this
country,
a
number
of
vehicles
with
flag
decals
and
whatnot.
it’s
common
accepted
usage.
in
that
act,
you
don’t
hear
people
jumping
up
and
down
and
saying,
well
that
act
is
pulling
out
the
flag
to
dishonor.
it
is
a
fairly
neutral
act.
you
can’t
tell
by
that
specific
conduct
what
exactly
the
person
intended
or
who
has
affixed
the
flag
to
the
bumper
or
to
the
rear
window
or
decal
and
whatnot.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor,
i
have
not
seen
any
bathing
suit
with
a
flag
but
i
would
think
that
if
an
entire
american
flag
was
on
bathing
suit,
if
it
was
on
the
posterior
side
as
the
facts
are
in
this
case,
then
it
would
be
proscribe
by
the
wearing
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
true
your
honor
and
of
course
i
haven’t
seen
any
instances
in
massachusetts
where
people
have
worn
flags
on
the
seat
of
their
pants.
anything
having
to
do
with
the
flag
at
least
in
the
greater
boston
area
gets
reported
as
this
case
was
rightly
reported.
the
first
circuit
seems
to
make
the
point
that
they
think
a
lot
of
conduct
that
may
or
may
not
be
proscribed
by
the
statute
has
sort
of
gone
by
the
boards
because
people
have
been
arrested
and
then
the
prosecution
wouldn’t
be
pressed
and
the
people's
rights
are
being
infringed
upon.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
that
is
just
a
fortuitous
conclusion.
any
conduct
involving
the
flag
receives
wide
publicity
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i
have
been
there
your
honor
many
times,
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
no,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
office
is
a
(inaudible)
which
is
the
area
for
speech
giving
in
whatnot
and
i
haven’t
seen
any
flag
desecration
at
all.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
no
i
cannot
point
to
any
other
authority
other
than
what
is
already
have
been
presented
to
the
court.
i
believe
i’ve
given
all
of
it
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
i
would
make
reference
though
to
a
certain
opinions
of
the
attorney
generals
of
massachusetts
over
the
years
which
indicate
that
we’re
dealing
with
flag
legislation
and
the
only
thing
that
the
statute
directs
itself
to,
are
actual
flags,
not
symbols
or
emblems
that
might
look
like
the
flag
or
whatnot.
additionally,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
term
flag
in
the
massachusetts’
statute
means
flags
in
contradistinction
to
many
of
the
other
statutes
that
the
courts
have
dealt
with
over
the
past
few
years.
many
flag
statutes
defined
the
flag
to
mean
not
only
the
actual
flag
but
stars
and
stripes
and
hats
or
emblems
or
symbols
or
whatnot
even
the
federal
flag
statute
gives
a
very
broad
definition
of
the
word
flag
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
this
is
the
first
case
dealing
with
the
flag
desecration
words
in
the
statute
that
does
has
arrived
at
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.,
the
only
case.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
this
is
the
only
case
i’m
aware
of
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
i’m
aware
of
none
other
than
this
one.
i
don’t
know
of
my
brother.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
your
honor,
i
didn’t
mean
to
confuse
you.
the
first
circuit
suggested
that
and
i
believe
it’s
sort
of
fortuitous
because
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i’m
unaware
of
any
your
honor.
the
most
recent
interpretation
of
the
statute
prior
to
this
opinion
is
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
richardson
in
1968
dealing
with
a
painting
where
there
was
a
swatch
sticker
in
the
place
of
the
stars.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
to
the
jurisdictional
state,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
circuit
also
spoke
about
first
amendment
overbreadth.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
true,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
district
court
judge
was
a
massachusetts’
judge.
he
was
just
then
appointed
to
the
federal
district
court
and
since
going
up
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
right,
your
honor,
yes.
i
would
think
that
that
matter
should
be
kept
in
mind
relative
to
the
exhaustion
point
that
we
made
initially.
it
seems
to
me
that
although
we
didn’t
press
exhaustion
before
judge
campbell,
we
presented
him
with
the
entire
state
court
record
with
the
understanding
as
usual
when
we
defend
federal
habeas
corpus
petitions
that
he
would
look
to
that
state
court
record
to
make
sure
that
the
man
is
being
pressed
before
him
had
been
raised
and
decided
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
massachusetts
what,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
e.
chase
they
certainly
have
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
this
is
the
only
case
we
know.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that’s
right,
your
honor
and
i
think
the
point
that
should
be
borne
in
mind
is
that
the
first
circuit
court
didn’t
look
to
any
of
the
rescript
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court.
none
at
all,
they
didn’t
speak
about
intent,
they
didn’t
speak
about
the
narrow
definition
of
flag.
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
first
circuit’s
conclusions
on
first
amendment
overbreadth.
the
first
circuit
said
in
so
many
words
that
all
flag
conduct
is
closely
akin
to
pure
speech
very
close
in
the
opinion
of
the
first
circuit.
i
think
that
many
courts
would
disagree
with
this.
if
you
start
from
that
starting
point
though
that
all
flag
conduct
is
closely
akin
to
pure
speech.
it’s
very
difficult
to
come
up
with
a
valid
state
reasons
as
to
why
this
legislation
is
not
directed
towards
the
first
amendment
in
conduct
under
the
first
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
though
that
from
the
citations
in
massachusetts’
opinion,
massachusetts’
opinion
recognized
two
interests
namely,
the
very
diffused
meaning
of
the
united
states
flag
for
all
american
citizens.
it
can’t
be
constricted
and
equated
to
a
promotion
of
patriotism
and
loyalty
as
the
first
circuit
said.
it’s
much
broader
than
that.
it
includes
that
but
it’s
so
much
broader
for
all
americans,
the
flag
means
so
much
to
--
we
constrict
and
restrict
the
meaning
of
the
flag
just
to
that
i
think
does
deserve
as
to
what
the
flag
means
for
americans.
number
two,
as
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
showed,
they
cited
halter,
they
cited
chaplinsky
and
they
cited
sutherland
v.
dewulf.
all
of
these
opinions
go
to
the
question
of
a
preservation
of
the
public
peace.
now,
i
know
this
court
has
said
say
in
cohen
versus
california
that
an
undifferentiated
fear
of
a
disturbance
is
not
enough
to
restrict
first
amendment
rights.
but
i
think
when
you
think
about
the
flag
and
when
you
think
about
the
various
states
that
have
passed
legislation
in
this
area,
i
think
the
determination
they
have
made
is
that
flag
desecration
is
the
type
of
conduct
that
per
se
is
likely
to
incite
a
breach
of
the
peace
and
i
think
that
though
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
before
you
that
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
was
going
to
occur,
i
don’t
think
that
goes
to
defeat
this
interest.
i
think
a
legislature
can
make
a
valid
determination
that
certain
types
of
conduct
are
so
offensive
to
normal
community
standards
that
they’re
very
likely
to
create
a
breach
of
the
peace
and
that
in
the
interest
of
the
welfare
of
the
community,
certain
types
of
conduct
can
be
proscribed
such
as
flag
desecration.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
address
myself
to
a
few
points
brought
out
by
my
brother
during
his
argument.
one
point
he
made
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
activity
involved
in
this
case
amounts
to
an
attack
on
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
and
it
takes
exception
with
that
phrase
physical
integrity.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
that
is
the
phrase
i
basically
used
in
my
brief
but
it
is
not
a
sacrosanct
phrase,
it
doesn’t
exhaust
the
state
interest.
i
would
just
cite
this
court
to
the
opinion
of
hoffman
versus
united
states
445
fed.
2d
226
where
they
spoke
about
conduct
that
physically
dishonors
the
flag
and
i
think
probably
that
that
phrase
physically
dishonor
is
more
the
aspect
of
this
particular
case.
there
was
a
dishonoring
of
the
flag
and
it
was
a
physical
dishonoring
of
the
flag
because
of
affixing
of
the
flag
to
the
posterior
anatomy
of
this
particular
individual.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor
we
would
urge
the
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
and
that
was
the
phrasing
in
the
complaint.
yes,
your
honor.
treat
contemptuously.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
we
would
as
a
--
yes,
they
urge
upon
this
court.
we
accepted
principle
of
statutory
interpretation
which
is
one
been
recognized
in
massachusetts
that
when
specific
words
and
more
general
words
are
associated
with
each
other
in
a
statute.
the
more
general
words
take
on
the
color
and
connotation
of
the
more
specific
and
are
in
that
sense.
we
streak
it
to
the
meaning
of
the
more
specific
words.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
no,
your
honor
but
that
is
an
accepted
principle
of
statutory
construction
in
massachusetts
and
there
are
four
or
five
cases
in
our
brief
showing
that
principle
in
operation.
i
cannot
deny
that
they
didn’t
mention
that
principle
but
i
think
it’s
clear
that
the
phrase
“treats
contemptuously”
is
directed
at
acts
of
the
same
type,
the
same
nature
namely
acts
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
all
three
of
those
first
phrases
are
directed
towards
physical
acts,
acts
that
affect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
my
brother
also
made
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
sentence
in
this
case
would
have
a
chilling
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights.
but
a
chilling
effect
on
what?
the
conviction
here
hasn’t
outlawed
the
use
of
the
flag
in
any
manner
of
means.
it
has
said
that
facts
that
desecrate
the
flag
will
be
punished
but
there
are
many
other
acts
that
protesters,
if
they
want
to
use
the
flag,
they
can
use
the
flag
and
also
it’s
a
demonstration.
they
are
just
supposed
to
not
desecrate
that
flag.
they
can
speak
all
man
of
violating
contemptuous
opinions
about
it
as
the
supreme
judicial
court
noted
in
this
rescript
opinion.
it
cited
the
street
opinion
and
said
he
was
not
prosecuted
for
words.
it
took
note
that
words
no
matter
how
contemptuous
about
the
flag
are
not
prosecutable.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor
but
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
there
were
certain
acts
of
which
the
conduct
is
so
egregious
saying
you
do
not
have
to
go
into
any
surrounding
circumstances
at
all
for
man
of
common
intelligence
to
agree
that
this
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
i
believe
it
did
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
they
had
to
find
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
treat
the
flag
contemptuously.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
my
understanding
of
the
rescript
opinion
and
my
understanding
of
the
rescript
is
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
will
require
the
prosecution
to
prove
intent
and
any
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
no,
your
honor,
you
have
the
entire
record
before
you
including
the
briefs
that
were
presented
to
the
supreme
judicial
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
you
may
have
what
was
before
the
supreme
judicial
court
your
honor.
i’m
not
entirely
sure
of
everything
that
was
before
the
massachusetts
trial
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
anything
that
is
contained
in
the
bill
of
exceptions.
anything
that
the
defendant
saves
for
argument
on
appeal.
in
other
words,
i
believe
my
brother
did
say
the
fact
that
two
instructions
were
refused
at
the
trial
but
i
believe
he
said
those
to
be
argued
before
the
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor,
i
don’t
know
but
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
this.
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
is
bound
by
the
bill
of
exceptions,
they
cannot
go
beyond
that
and
it
is
up
to
the
parties
in
the
court
below
to
make
sure
that
everything
is
relevant,
it
gets
into
the
amended
bill
of
exceptions
or
bill
of
exceptions.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
yes,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
charles
e.
chase
well,
your
honor
i
would
just
say
this,
for
my
knowledge
of
how
court
appeals
are
taken
in
massachusetts
that
the
losing
party
has
the
burden
of
putting
the
material
in
the
record
that
is
going
up
on
the
bill
of
exceptions.
the
prosecution
has
no
burden
to
compile
that
bill
of
exceptions.
the
losing
party
does
and
then
they
get
together
and
confer
with
the
trial
judge
and
there
is
an
agreement
as
to
whether
or
not
everything
in
the
bill
of
exceptions
should
be
there.
and
it’s
generally
worked
out
by
agreement
with
the
trial
judge
in
both
sides
but
it’s
the
losing
party
who
has
the
initial
burden
of
going
forward
to
compile
the
bill
of
exceptions.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
i
want
to
thank
the
court.
mr.
charles
e.
chase
certainly,
your
honor.
that
is
the
basis
of
my
argument.
i
think
it
seems
there
is
quite
clear
that
whatever
communication
was
involved
could
have
come
through
much
more
clearly
with
some
words
which
would
not
have
been
prosecuted.
thank
you.
