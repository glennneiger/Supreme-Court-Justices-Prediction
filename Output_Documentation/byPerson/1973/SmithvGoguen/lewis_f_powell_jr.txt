justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
appellee
wore
a
smaller
representation
of
the
united
states’
flag
on
the
seat
of
his
trousers.
he
was
prosecuted
under
massachusetts
statute
that
subjects
to
criminal
liability
anyone
who
publicly
treats
contemptuously
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
although
other
portions
of
the
statute
deal
broadly
with
misuse
and
mutilation
of
the
flag,
appellee
was
charged
only
with
treating
it
contemptuously.
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
six
months
imprisonment.
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
affirmed
the
conviction.
thereafter
a
federal
district
court
found
the
statute
unconstitutionally
vague
and
overbroad
and
granted
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
agree
with
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
contempt
portion
of
the
statute
is
void
for
vagueness
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
statute,
whose
sweeping
language
has
never
been
narrowed
by
the
state
courts,
affords
inadequate
warning
of
the
forbidden
conduct.
moreover
it
leaves
the
police,
the
courts
and
juries
free
to
prosecute
and
impose
criminal
liabilities
on
little
more
than
their
own
preferences
for
treatment
of
the
flag.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
blackmun
and
rehnquist
have
filed
dissenting
opinions
in
which
the
chief
justice
had
joined.
