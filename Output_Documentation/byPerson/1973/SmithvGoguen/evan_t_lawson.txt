mr.
evan
t.
lawson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
evan
lawson
and
i
represent
the
appellee
in
this
case.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
at
the
close
of
argument
yesterday,
i
was
considering
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
had
asked
my
brother
mr.
chase.
i
felt
that
they
justified
some
immediate
answers
from
me
because
i
have
more
personal
knowledge
of
the
case
than
he
does.
a
question
was
raised
as
to
what
is
a
vexillologist.
a
vexillologist
is
a
flag
historian.
the
particular
gentleman
who
was
involved
in
this
case,
mr.
whitney
smith
is
the
secretary-general
of
the
international
federation
of
vexillology
and
he
has
written
the
definitive
book
on
the
subject
of
flags
and
their
history.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
best
seller
but
he
did
also
write
the
section
on
flags
in
all
of
the
encyclopedias
which
are
published
in
this
country.
his
purpose
in
testifying
was
really
twofold.
number
one,
his
testimony
was
directed
to
whether
the
flag
involved
in
this
case
conformed
to
the
official
standards
and
although
the
record
indicates
that
he
testified
that
it
did
conform
to
the
official
standards.
that’s
actually
a
misprint.
in
fact,
he
testified
that
it
did
not
conform
to
the
official
standards.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
the
proportions,
there
were
no
official
standards
regulating
a
given
size,
four
by
six,
three
by
five.
that
is
not
what’s
denoted
by
an
official
flag.
the
proportions
however,
the
relation
of
the
height
to
the
width
and
the
size
in
relative
proportion
of
the
stripes
and
the
field
with
the
stars
go,
are
all
regulated
by
a
federal
executive
order
pursuant
to
statute,
federal
statute.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
that’s
correct
and
this
flag
in
this
case
did
not
conform
to
those
proportions.
secondly
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
am
not
saying
that.
however,
i
think
that
the
state
should
to
avoid
vagueness
specify
whether
it
is
referring
to,
in
fact
the
flag
as
defined
officially
or
whether
it’s
referring
to
any
representation
that
could
look
like
a
flag.
some
statutes
and
some
states
refer
only
to
representations.
other
statutes
do
not
indicate
whether
they
apply
to
--
strictly
the
flag
or
just
the
stars
and
stripes
design
and
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
however,
at
the
trial
--
at
the
trial
mr.
smith
testified
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
type
of
flag
that
the
defendant
was
supposed
to
have
been
wearing.
in
other
words,
a
small
commercially
produced
cloth
flag
and
he
testified
that
those
flags
that
he
was
a
consultant
to
the
firms
which
produce
those
flags
and
those
flags
do
not
conform
to
the
executive
order.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it
did
not
appear.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
the
record
was
silent.
the
pants
were
not,
i
can
state
from
my
own
knowledge,
manufactured
that
way
but
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
he
sewed
them
or
not.
and
in
fact,
that’s
something
that
i
wish
to
bring
up
at
a
later
time
but
now
that
you
have
mentioned
it.
my
brother
has
argued
rather
strenuously
that
this
statute
applies
to
the
physical
integrity,
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
i
think
that
making
that
argument
really
highlights
the
vagueness
in
this
case
because
it
seems
to
me,
at
least,
that
there
is
no
possible
justification
for
saying
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
this
defendant
affected
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
by
doing
what
he
did
which
was
merely
displaying
it.
if
in
fact
you
assume
that
he
himself
sewed
it,
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
he
sewed
it
publicly.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
which
is
also
an
element
of
the
statute.
if
we
treat
this
as
a
continuing
offense
so
that
he’s
sewing
and
then
he’s
displaying
in
some
way
constitutes
a
public
sewing,
even
in
that,
by
that
stretch
of
the
imagination,
now
the
question
of
whether
sewing
something
onto
a
larger
piece
of
cloth,
let’s
say
affects
it’s
physical
integrity
and
is
certainly,
seriously
open
to
question.
i
would
strongly
argue
that
it
does
not
further
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don’t
think
that
anything
that
i
have
to
say
this
morning
really
hinges
on
that
misprint
on
the
record.
i’d
only
point
out
that
my
brief
is
--
my
brief
in
the
state
court
is
reproduced
in
the
record
and
in
that
brief,
there
is
a
section
dealing
with
the
official
flag.
i
believe
it's
page
25
of
the
appendix
and
in
the
brief
we
do
refer
to
the
testimony
as
saying
that
it
did
not
conform
to
the
official
standards
with
this
citation
to
the
bill
of
exceptions.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
agree.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
agree
and
i
think
that
this
is
really
a
matter
of
very
small
importance
to
my
argument.
second
question
that
was
asked
was
whether
there
were
any
prosecutions
in
massachusetts
under
the
statue
other
than
this
one
and
my
brother
was
not
aware
of
any.
i’m
personally
aware
of
at
least
five.
i
represented
two
other
individuals
who
were
prosecuted
under
the
statute
for
displaying
flags
on
various
portions
of
their
anatomy;
a
young
woman
who
had
her
flag
displayed
on
seat
of
her
pants
and
a
young
man
who
had
a
flag
displayed
in
a
crouch
area
of
his
pants.
i
further
represented
an
individual
who
was
charged
with
flag
burning
which
is
really
distinguishable
from
this
case
and
i
am
aware
of
a
prosecution
of
an
individual
for
displaying
a
flag
upside
down
on
a
back
of
a
jacket
in
massachusetts.
i
am
also
aware
of
another
flag
burning
prosecution
in
massachusetts.
so
that
this
is
by
far
not
the
only
prosecution
and
they
have
actually
been
enough
to
raise
some
significance.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
he
served
about
13
or
14
days
of
that
sentence.
and
of
course,
one
of
the
issues
here
is
whether
someone
who
does
what
this
respondent
did
should
be
sentenced
to
six
months
in
prison.
i
mentioned
this
not
merely
to
generate
some
sympathy
for
the
respondent
but
also
to
point
out
that
that
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights,
there
is
the
rubric
of
the
chilling
effect
and
certainly
the
widely
publicized
imprisonment
or
sentence
in
this
case
of
six
months
is
clearly
a
chilling
effect
to
be
had.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
first
of
all,
i
can
answer
the
second
question
first.
there
is
no
record
of
them
in
any
printed
court
opinions.
the
girl
who
i
represented
who
had
a
flag
on
the
seat
of
her
pants
wrote
an
essay
on
what
the
flag
means
and
received
a
lecture
from
the
judge
and
had
her
case
as
a
procedure
in
massachusetts
court
continuing
without
a
finding.
she
had
a
case
continued
for
six
months
without
a
finding
and
after
that
it
was
dismissed.
the
young
man
who
was
wearing
a
flag
upside-down
on
his
jacket
was
fined
in
the
district
court
and
appealed
that
to
massachusetts
superior
court
for
jury
trial
and
that
case
is
still
pending.
i
don’t
know
the
outcome
of
that
case.
in
one
of
the
flag
burning
cases
which
as
i
say
i
think
i
am
really
not
factually
on
point
with
this
case.
the
defendant
who
was
a
high
school
student
was
sentenced
to
i
think
three
months
in
the
massachusetts
district
court.
on
appeal
to
the
superior
court,
the
superior
court
judge
agreed
to
continue
her
case
without
a
finding
provided
that
she
would
walk
from
harvard
square,
i
think
to
downtown
boston
carrying
an
american
flag
and
she
did
that
and
that
was
how
that
case
was
disposed
off.
so
that
some
of
these
cases
have
been
disposed
off
in
non-criminal
ways.
one
case
that
i’m
aware
of,
the
district
court
judge
which
is
the
lowest
court
in
massachusetts
ruled
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
but
this
was
before
the
state
court
had
ruled
in
the
goguen
case
and
i
presume
that
his
ruling
is
not
imported
anywhere.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it
is
as
good
precedent
as
any
opinion.
as
i
say
it’s
closely
akin
to
--
as
mr.
chase
said,
closely
akin
to
a
per
curiam
opinion
in
this
court
and
this
rescript
is
rather,
at
least
in
my
experience,
is
rather
strange
rescript
and
that
it
says
a
little
bit
more
than
the
ordinary
rescript
does.
but
it
says
a
lot
less
than
of
course
an
opinion
which
is
carefully
laid
out.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes,
it
was.
it
was
rendered
after
all
argument
and
i
might
say
now
that
my
brother
has
said
that
we
cannot
raise
the
question
of
fourteenth
amendment
vagueness
here
because
it
wasn’t
presented
to
the
state
court
and
asked
you
to
conduct
what
appears
to
me
to
be
an
essay
contest
where
you
grade
our
briefs
and
determine
whether
they’re
acceptable
as
good
legal
writing.
however,
in
his
answer
in
the
federal
district
court
below,
he
admitted
that
we’d
raised
the
issue
and
had
he
not
admitted
it,
had
he
raised
the
question
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
vagueness
being
exhausted
in
the
state
court.
i
might
have
been
in
the
position
to
introduce
some
testimony
and
some
evidence
on
whether
this
matter
was
in
fact
discussed
in
oral
argument.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct
and
i
think
that
we
did.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
petition,
we
raised
both
vagueness
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
sense
of
lack
of
fair
notice
and
we
specifically
used
the
phrase
made
it
impossible
for
law
enforcement
officers
to
enforce
the
statute
fairly
and
we
also
raised
overbreadth
in
the
first
amendment
sense.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
don’t
think
i
can
make
the
flag
burning
argument
as
to
vagueness
because
the
statute
does
in
fact
specifically
say
that
you
may
not
burn
a
flag
in
massachusetts.
i
would
be
making
the
same
overbreadth
argument.
the
difference
would
be
in
the
analysis
of
the
overbreadth
argument
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
is
this
legitimate
state
interest
if
any
in
passing
this
kind
of
legislation.
certainly,
if
this
court
found
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag,
that
interest
would
be
served
by
statute
prohibiting
flag
burning.
but
would
not
be
served
by
prosecution
and
conviction
in
the
case
at
bar
where
there
was
no
conduct
affecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
from
that,
that’s
correct.
form
my
point
of
view,
there
is
no
different
interest.
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
state
has
no
interest
in
protecting
flag
per
se.
however,
i
can
see
that
cases
should
be
litigated
in
the
context
in
which
they
arise
and
that
therefore
either
that
this
court
could
say
for
example
there
maybe
a
state
interest
in
protecting
physical
integrity
but
it’s
necessary
--
it’s
not
necessary
to
decide
that
in
this
case.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct
and
as
long
as
the
point
is,
i
will
try
to
develop
that
argument.
i
think
that
the
question
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
it
belongs
to
the
individual
himself.
obviously,
statute
which
prohibited
burning
or
destroying
someone
else’s
property
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
and
that
there
will
be
no
argument
whatsoever
that
one
could
destroy
public
property
or
someone
else’s
property
in
the
interest
of
free
speech.
i
think
the
analysis
really
begins
with
this
court’s
decision
in
broadrick.
in
broadrick
which
was
discussing
first
amendment
standing.
the
court
talked
about
how
first
amendment
protection
becomes
attenuated
as
the
fact
situation
moves
along
that
continuum
from
the
spoken
and
printed
word,
to
over
a
conduct
which
may
be
otherwise
harmful.
at
one
end
of
a
spectrum,
you’d
have
a
speech
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
you’d
had
a
political
assassination.
both
of
which
are
arguable
communicative,
the
speech
is
clearly
protected.
the
political
assassination
is
clearly
unprotected.
we
argue
that
the
conduct
in
this
case
is
so
closely
akin
to
pure
speech
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
under
the
broadrick
analysis
that
you
don’t
apply
symbolic
speech
test
such
as
the
o’brien
test
here.
you
apply
a
direct
spoken
word
test
and
my
precedent
for
that
would
be
for
example
in
the
stromberg
case
displaying
a
red
flag
and
the
tinker
case
wearing
a
black
armband,
in
the
barnette
case
refusing
to
salute
the
flag.
all
of
those
cases
involved
conduct
which
is
otherwise
totally
harmless.
in
the
words
of
barnette,
no
rights
of
any
other
individuals
were
infringed
upon
by
the
conduct
of
the
appellee
and
therefore
this
case
should
be
treated
strictly
as
a
free
speech
case
and
not
as
the
case
involving
symbolic
speech
or
conduct.
even
if
you
were
to
treat
this
as
a
symbolic
speech
case
and
apply
the
o’brien
test.
i
would
urge
that
this
statute
and
the
facts
in
this
case
both
on
their
face
and
as
applied
to
this
appellee
fail
the
o’brien
test
miserably
and
one
area
of
o’brien
test
which
was
the
track
that
i
was
on
was
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
i
can
think
of
but
three
state
interests
which
you
could
postulate
in
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
one
would
be
to
protect
against
breaches
of
the
peace.
clearly
this
statute
is
not
narrowly
drawn
enough
to
do
that
and
secondly,
it’s
very
clear
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
was
no
breach
of
the
peace
eminent
or
otherwise.
a
second
state
interest
might
be
to
protect
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes.
i
agree
to
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think
i
can
amplify
on
that.
there
was
no
general
demonstration.
there
was
a
normal
group
of
people
on
the
street
and
when
the
policeman
began
questioning
goguen
who
was
talking
to
this
group
of
people.
the
people
in
the
group
started
laughing.
but
this
was
not
a
demonstration
by
anyone
other
than
goguen.
we
contend
however
that
this
very
clearly
was
a
demonstration
of
one.
and
that
goguen
himself
was
expressing
opinion.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
and
that
--
i
think
i
can
amplify
in
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think
i
can
amplify
in
the
record
and
say
that
goguen
got
out,
left
his
house,
walked
down
town
and
met
some
friends
of
his
standing
around
the
street
corner
and
basically
that
was
the
group
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
goguen
is
still
engaging
an
expressive
conduct
here.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
when
the
officer
arrived
goguen
was
standing
talking
to
a
group
of
people.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
as
far
as
i
know
that
it
was
just
a
casual
conversation.
and
that
this
is
something
akin
to
the
situation
where
one
of
us
might
place
a
political
bumper
sticker
on
our
car
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
some
political
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
not
in
the
context,
not
in
the
limited
factual
context
of
the
group.
however
in
the
context
of
the
times,
one
can
certainly
infer
that
this
was
at
the
height
of
the
protest
movement.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no.
i
think
not
only
did
the
officer
take
exception
to
the
fact
that
the
flag
was
on
the
seat
of
goguen’s
pants
but
goguen
obviously
conveyed
to
the
officer
a
powerful
feeling
of
contempt
for
the
flag
and
in
fact,
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
necessarily
a
finding
by
the
jury
in
order
to
convict
goguen
that
he
was
expressing
contempt
for
the
flag.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
by
the
way
he
was
displaying.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
now
this
is
very
much
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
don’t
think
that
i
can
precisely
define
what
he
was
trying
to
express.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
that’s
correct
and
there
was
a
good
reason
for
that
at
the
time
which
doesn’t
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
he
did
not
testify
on
my
advice.
in
any
event,
what
he
was
trying
to
express
cannot
be
precisely
defined.
i
will
grant
you
however
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
think
i
can
show
it
from
what
he
did.
first
of
all
there
is
a
finding
on
the
part
of
the
jury
that
he
expressed
contempt
for
the
flag
and
this
court
had
said
in
street,
that
that
kind
of
an
expression
is
constitutionally
protected.
precise
expression
has
never
been
prerequisite
for
first
amendment
protection.
i
would
for
example
refer
you
to
the
papish
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
march.
in
the
papish
case,
the
defendant
was
displaying
a
cartoon
which
showed
--
and
among
other
things,
she
was
displaying
a
cartoon
which
showed
the
police
officer
raping
the
statue
of
liberty.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don’t
believe
you
had
a
record
of
the
full
trial
but
you
certainly
had
the
words
of
street
which
we
use
in
that
case.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
true
but
what
i’m
urging
upon
you
is
that
when
you
communicate
not
through
words
but
through
the
use
of
symbols.
a
black
armband
for
example
can
be
ambiguous.
a
red
flag
can
be
ambiguous.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no
but
in
the
tinker
case,
there
was
a
school
regulation
forbidding
the
display
for
black
armband.
in
the
stromberg
case,
there
was
a
statute
forbidding
the
display
of
a
red
flag
and
in
the
goguen
case
there
was
statute
forbidding
the
display
of
contemptuous
feelings
about
the
flag.
so
that
in
each
case,
there
is
a
proscription,
an
official
proscription
against
the
particular
symbolic
form
of
expression
which
the
actor
is
trying
to
use.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don’t
believe
that
it
was
a
specific
school
regulation
against
the
wearing
of
armbands,
it
was
a
specific
school
regulation
against
engaging
in
certain
kinds
of
conduct
which
was
deemed
to
be
harmful
and
the
school
authorities
then
interpreted
the
wearing
of
the
black
armbands
as
being
harmful.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
apologize
if
i
misstated
it.
in
the
papish
case,
this
cartoon
which
shows
the
police
officer
raping
the
statue
of
liberty
could
certainly
be
subjected
to
varied
interpretations.
it
could
mean
for
example,
it
could
be
anti-police.
it
could
be
anti-law
enforcement
generally.
it
could
be
anti-america
and
the
fact
that
the
cartoon
is
susceptible
of
many
interpretations
did
not,
in
the
papish
case
relieve
it
of
constitutional
protection.
similarly,
i’d
urge
that
varied
forms
of
display
of
the
flag
which
express
contempt.
similarly
are
protected
even
though
you
can't
precisely
define
what
the
particular
actor
is
saying.
a
classic
example
is
poetry.
if
each
of
us
read
a
poem,
we
might
derive
a
different
meaning
from
the
words
of
the
poem.
in
that
sense,
the
poem
is
as
ambiguous
as
goguen’s
conduct
here
but
no
one
would
argue
that
that
a
poem
isn’t
constitutionally
protected
or
words
to
a
song.
i’d
like
to
get
back
to
the
state's
interest
in
prosecuting
goguen.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it’s
not
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes,
i
do.
it
was
decided
in
march
of
1973.
i
have
a
citation
to
the
supreme
court
reported
which
is
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
excuse
me?
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don’t
think

mr.
evan

this
is

mr.
evan
t.

that’s
correct.
mr.
evan

yes,
it
did.
it
was
a
--
well
it
came
from
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
a
case
involving
an

and
suit
brought
to

mr.
evan
t.
lawson

fed.
2d
136.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
the
state
interest
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--
is
the
states
interest
in
protecting
the
flag
in
and
off
itself
as
some
sort
of
a
symbol.
besides
the
fact
that
that
the
symbolic
significance
of
the
flag
has
been
recognized
certainly
by
this
court
in
halter
and
in
barnette,
the
court
also
has
recognized
that
the
state
has
no
interest.
the
government
has
no
interest
in
protecting
that
symbolic
significance
from
use
by
citizens.
barnette
expressly
i
think
said
that.
street
certainly
said
that.
chief
judge
lumbard
in
the
cahn
case
also
examined
a
hypothetical
state
interest
in
protecting
the
flag
as
a
symbol
and
found
that
there
was
no
state
interest
and
of
course
judge
coffin
in
this
case
arrived
at
a
similar
result.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
long
island
moratorium
--
in
long
island
vietnam
moratorium
committee
versus
cahn.
now
in
arriving
at
that
result
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
there
is
no
transcript
to
testimony
because
none
was
presented
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
in
massachusetts
this
appeal
was
pursuant
to
a
bill
of
exceptions
which
set
forth
a
summary
of
the
testimony.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
there
are
no
proceedings.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
there
is
no
record
of
the
proceedings.
they
have
only
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
rescript
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it
had
no
record
before
of
what
it
transpired,
either
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
or
in
the
state
superior
court
where
the
jury
trial
took
place.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
it
had
nothing
--
it
had
nothing
more
than
the
bill
of
exceptions.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes.
it
didn’t
have
the
bill
of
exceptions
report.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes.
the
bill
of
exceptions
is
a
part
of
the
appendix
here
and
was
before
the
united
states
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
matter.
i
see
my
time
is
almost
up.
one
thing
that
i
would
suggest
to
you
is
that
if
there
is
an
interest
in
protecting
the
flag
in
and
of
itself.
that
interest
is
subjected
to
almost
limitless
extension.
if
you’re
going
to
protect
the
flag,
why
not
protect
the
state
seal
as
well
or
the
federal
seal?
why
not
protect
the
national
anthem
as
in
fact
michigan
has
a
statute
which
prohibits
playing
the
national
anthem
or
--
and
other
than
the
normal
notes
or
the
prescribed
notes.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no.
we
don’t
--
i
don’t
quarrel
with
that
at
all
in
slight.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
would
say
that
that
is
the
reason.
i
think
the
rationale
behind
that
reason
is
that
they
could
--
there
is
a
finding
that
it’s
harmful
to
have
this
symbol
used
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think
that
that’s
all
right
and
i
think
under
the
rational
or
under
the
broadrick
analysis
for
example,
there
is
no
problem
in
differentiating
between
the
two
because
as
in
here
and
broadrick
and
street
and
stromberg
and
tinker.
the
conduct
is
harmless.
it’s
passive.
it
doesn’t
impinge
on
the
rights
of
anyone
else.
when
you’re
talking
about
using
the
flag
or
using
the
state
seal
for
commercial
purposes
or
using
it
perhaps
reproducing
it
for
purposes
of
counterfeiting
or
something
of
that
sort
then
the
conduct
moves
from
the
area
of
being
harmless
into
the
area
of
being
harmful
and
state
does
have
an
interest
certainly
in
regulating
harmful
conduct
even
if
they’re
arguably
speech
elements
involved.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct
and
the
reason
which
the
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that
is
correct
and
i
think
the
reason
for
it,
is
that
a
passerby
seeing
the
state
seal
could
be
misled
for
example
on
to
thinking
that
that
whatever
the
product
was,
was
federally
approved
or
federally
sanctioned
and
then
that
would
be
--
could
be
harmful.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no,
i
don’t
see.
i
don’t
think
that
from
the
point
of
view
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no,
there
is
none.
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
don’t
think
that
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
and
consistent
with
the
history
of
this
country
that
one
can
say
that
that
is
constitutionally
permissible
to
punish
denigration.
the
whole
idea,
a
flag
desecration
implies
that
there
is
some
--
there
is
some
mistake
or
sacred
power
connected
with
the
flag
and
historically
of
course,
it
was
only
at
the
turn
of
this
century
that
there
was
any
legislation
at
all
passed
regulating
conduct
relating
to
the
flag.
england
in
a
thousand
years
of
history
has
never
regulated
conduct
concerning
its
flag.
so
that
our
tradition,
our
democratic
tradition
i
think
shies
away
from
that.
thank
you.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
evan
lawson
and
i
represent
the
appellee
in
this
case.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
at
the
close
of
argument
yesterday,
i
was
considering
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
had
asked
my
brother
mr.
chase.
i
felt
that
they
justified
some
immediate
answers
from
me
because
i
have
more
personal
knowledge
of
the
case
than
he
does.
a
question
was
raised
as
to
what
is
a
vexillologist.
a
vexillologist
is
a
flag
historian.
the
particular
gentleman
who
was
involved
in
this
case,
mr.
whitney
smith
is
the
secretary-general
of
the
international
federation
of
vexillology
and
he
has
written
the
definitive
book
on
the
subject
of
flags
and
their
history.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
best
seller
but
he
did
also
write
the
section
on
flags
in
all
of
the
encyclopedias
which
are
published
in
this
country.
his
purpose
in
testifying
was
really
twofold.
number
one,
his
testimony
was
directed
to
whether
the
flag
involved
in
this
case
conformed
to
the
official
standards
and
although
the
record
indicates
that
he
testified
that
it
did
conform
to
the
official
standards.
that’s
actually
a
misprint.
in
fact,
he
testified
that
it
did
not
conform
to
the
official
standards.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
the
proportions,
there
were
no
official
standards
regulating
a
given
size,
four
by
six,
three
by
five.
that
is
not
what’s
denoted
by
an
official
flag.
the
proportions
however,
the
relation
of
the
height
to
the
width
and
the
size
in
relative
proportion
of
the
stripes
and
the
field
with
the
stars
go,
are
all
regulated
by
a
federal
executive
order
pursuant
to
statute,
federal
statute.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
that’s
correct
and
this
flag
in
this
case
did
not
conform
to
those
proportions.
secondly
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
am
not
saying
that.
however,
i
think
that
the
state
should
to
avoid
vagueness
specify
whether
it
is
referring
to,
in
fact
the
flag
as
defined
officially
or
whether
it’s
referring
to
any
representation
that
could
look
like
a
flag.
some
statutes
and
some
states
refer
only
to
representations.
other
statutes
do
not
indicate
whether
they
apply
to
--
strictly
the
flag
or
just
the
stars
and
stripes
design
and
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
however,
at
the
trial
--
at
the
trial
mr.
smith
testified
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
type
of
flag
that
the
defendant
was
supposed
to
have
been
wearing.
in
other
words,
a
small
commercially
produced
cloth
flag
and
he
testified
that
those
flags
that
he
was
a
consultant
to
the
firms
which
produce
those
flags
and
those
flags
do
not
conform
to
the
executive
order.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it
did
not
appear.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
the
record
was
silent.
the
pants
were
not,
i
can
state
from
my
own
knowledge,
manufactured
that
way
but
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
he
sewed
them
or
not.
and
in
fact,
that’s
something
that
i
wish
to
bring
up
at
a
later
time
but
now
that
you
have
mentioned
it.
my
brother
has
argued
rather
strenuously
that
this
statute
applies
to
the
physical
integrity,
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
i
think
that
making
that
argument
really
highlights
the
vagueness
in
this
case
because
it
seems
to
me,
at
least,
that
there
is
no
possible
justification
for
saying
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
this
defendant
affected
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
by
doing
what
he
did
which
was
merely
displaying
it.
if
in
fact
you
assume
that
he
himself
sewed
it,
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
he
sewed
it
publicly.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
which
is
also
an
element
of
the
statute.
if
we
treat
this
as
a
continuing
offense
so
that
he’s
sewing
and
then
he’s
displaying
in
some
way
constitutes
a
public
sewing,
even
in
that,
by
that
stretch
of
the
imagination,
now
the
question
of
whether
sewing
something
onto
a
larger
piece
of
cloth,
let’s
say
affects
it’s
physical
integrity
and
is
certainly,
seriously
open
to
question.
i
would
strongly
argue
that
it
does
not
further
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don’t
think
that
anything
that
i
have
to
say
this
morning
really
hinges
on
that
misprint
on
the
record.
i’d
only
point
out
that
my
brief
is
--
my
brief
in
the
state
court
is
reproduced
in
the
record
and
in
that
brief,
there
is
a
section
dealing
with
the
official
flag.
i
believe
it's
page
25
of
the
appendix
and
in
the
brief
we
do
refer
to
the
testimony
as
saying
that
it
did
not
conform
to
the
official
standards
with
this
citation
to
the
bill
of
exceptions.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
agree.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
agree
and
i
think
that
this
is
really
a
matter
of
very
small
importance
to
my
argument.
second
question
that
was
asked
was
whether
there
were
any
prosecutions
in
massachusetts
under
the
statue
other
than
this
one
and
my
brother
was
not
aware
of
any.
i’m
personally
aware
of
at
least
five.
i
represented
two
other
individuals
who
were
prosecuted
under
the
statute
for
displaying
flags
on
various
portions
of
their
anatomy;
a
young
woman
who
had
her
flag
displayed
on
seat
of
her
pants
and
a
young
man
who
had
a
flag
displayed
in
a
crouch
area
of
his
pants.
i
further
represented
an
individual
who
was
charged
with
flag
burning
which
is
really
distinguishable
from
this
case
and
i
am
aware
of
a
prosecution
of
an
individual
for
displaying
a
flag
upside
down
on
a
back
of
a
jacket
in
massachusetts.
i
am
also
aware
of
another
flag
burning
prosecution
in
massachusetts.
so
that
this
is
by
far
not
the
only
prosecution
and
they
have
actually
been
enough
to
raise
some
significance.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
he
served
about
13
or
14
days
of
that
sentence.
and
of
course,
one
of
the
issues
here
is
whether
someone
who
does
what
this
respondent
did
should
be
sentenced
to
six
months
in
prison.
i
mentioned
this
not
merely
to
generate
some
sympathy
for
the
respondent
but
also
to
point
out
that
that
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights,
there
is
the
rubric
of
the
chilling
effect
and
certainly
the
widely
publicized
imprisonment
or
sentence
in
this
case
of
six
months
is
clearly
a
chilling
effect
to
be
had.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
first
of
all,
i
can
answer
the
second
question
first.
there
is
no
record
of
them
in
any
printed
court
opinions.
the
girl
who
i
represented
who
had
a
flag
on
the
seat
of
her
pants
wrote
an
essay
on
what
the
flag
means
and
received
a
lecture
from
the
judge
and
had
her
case
as
a
procedure
in
massachusetts
court
continuing
without
a
finding.
she
had
a
case
continued
for
six
months
without
a
finding
and
after
that
it
was
dismissed.
the
young
man
who
was
wearing
a
flag
upside-down
on
his
jacket
was
fined
in
the
district
court
and
appealed
that
to
massachusetts
superior
court
for
jury
trial
and
that
case
is
still
pending.
i
don’t
know
the
outcome
of
that
case.
in
one
of
the
flag
burning
cases
which
as
i
say
i
think
i
am
really
not
factually
on
point
with
this
case.
the
defendant
who
was
a
high
school
student
was
sentenced
to
i
think
three
months
in
the
massachusetts
district
court.
on
appeal
to
the
superior
court,
the
superior
court
judge
agreed
to
continue
her
case
without
a
finding
provided
that
she
would
walk
from
harvard
square,
i
think
to
downtown
boston
carrying
an
american
flag
and
she
did
that
and
that
was
how
that
case
was
disposed
off.
so
that
some
of
these
cases
have
been
disposed
off
in
non-criminal
ways.
one
case
that
i’m
aware
of,
the
district
court
judge
which
is
the
lowest
court
in
massachusetts
ruled
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
but
this
was
before
the
state
court
had
ruled
in
the
goguen
case
and
i
presume
that
his
ruling
is
not
imported
anywhere.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it
is
as
good
precedent
as
any
opinion.
as
i
say
it’s
closely
akin
to
--
as
mr.
chase
said,
closely
akin
to
a
per
curiam
opinion
in
this
court
and
this
rescript
is
rather,
at
least
in
my
experience,
is
rather
strange
rescript
and
that
it
says
a
little
bit
more
than
the
ordinary
rescript
does.
but
it
says
a
lot
less
than
of
course
an
opinion
which
is
carefully
laid
out.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes,
it
was.
it
was
rendered
after
all
argument
and
i
might
say
now
that
my
brother
has
said
that
we
cannot
raise
the
question
of
fourteenth
amendment
vagueness
here
because
it
wasn’t
presented
to
the
state
court
and
asked
you
to
conduct
what
appears
to
me
to
be
an
essay
contest
where
you
grade
our
briefs
and
determine
whether
they’re
acceptable
as
good
legal
writing.
however,
in
his
answer
in
the
federal
district
court
below,
he
admitted
that
we’d
raised
the
issue
and
had
he
not
admitted
it,
had
he
raised
the
question
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
vagueness
being
exhausted
in
the
state
court.
i
might
have
been
in
the
position
to
introduce
some
testimony
and
some
evidence
on
whether
this
matter
was
in
fact
discussed
in
oral
argument.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct
and
i
think
that
we
did.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
petition,
we
raised
both
vagueness
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
sense
of
lack
of
fair
notice
and
we
specifically
used
the
phrase
made
it
impossible
for
law
enforcement
officers
to
enforce
the
statute
fairly
and
we
also
raised
overbreadth
in
the
first
amendment
sense.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
don’t
think
i
can
make
the
flag
burning
argument
as
to
vagueness
because
the
statute
does
in
fact
specifically
say
that
you
may
not
burn
a
flag
in
massachusetts.
i
would
be
making
the
same
overbreadth
argument.
the
difference
would
be
in
the
analysis
of
the
overbreadth
argument
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
is
this
legitimate
state
interest
if
any
in
passing
this
kind
of
legislation.
certainly,
if
this
court
found
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag,
that
interest
would
be
served
by
statute
prohibiting
flag
burning.
but
would
not
be
served
by
prosecution
and
conviction
in
the
case
at
bar
where
there
was
no
conduct
affecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
from
that,
that’s
correct.
form
my
point
of
view,
there
is
no
different
interest.
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
state
has
no
interest
in
protecting
flag
per
se.
however,
i
can
see
that
cases
should
be
litigated
in
the
context
in
which
they
arise
and
that
therefore
either
that
this
court
could
say
for
example
there
maybe
a
state
interest
in
protecting
physical
integrity
but
it’s
necessary
--
it’s
not
necessary
to
decide
that
in
this
case.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct
and
as
long
as
the
point
is,
i
will
try
to
develop
that
argument.
i
think
that
the
question
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
it
belongs
to
the
individual
himself.
obviously,
statute
which
prohibited
burning
or
destroying
someone
else’s
property
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it
would
be
perfectly
constitutional
and
that
there
will
be
no
argument
whatsoever
that
one
could
destroy
public
property
or
someone
else’s
property
in
the
interest
of
free
speech.
i
think
the
analysis
really
begins
with
this
court’s
decision
in
broadrick.
in
broadrick
which
was
discussing
first
amendment
standing.
the
court
talked
about
how
first
amendment
protection
becomes
attenuated
as
the
fact
situation
moves
along
that
continuum
from
the
spoken
and
printed
word,
to
over
a
conduct
which
may
be
otherwise
harmful.
at
one
end
of
a
spectrum,
you’d
have
a
speech
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
you’d
had
a
political
assassination.
both
of
which
are
arguable
communicative,
the
speech
is
clearly
protected.
the
political
assassination
is
clearly
unprotected.
we
argue
that
the
conduct
in
this
case
is
so
closely
akin
to
pure
speech
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
under
the
broadrick
analysis
that
you
don’t
apply
symbolic
speech
test
such
as
the
o’brien
test
here.
you
apply
a
direct
spoken
word
test
and
my
precedent
for
that
would
be
for
example
in
the
stromberg
case
displaying
a
red
flag
and
the
tinker
case
wearing
a
black
armband,
in
the
barnette
case
refusing
to
salute
the
flag.
all
of
those
cases
involved
conduct
which
is
otherwise
totally
harmless.
in
the
words
of
barnette,
no
rights
of
any
other
individuals
were
infringed
upon
by
the
conduct
of
the
appellee
and
therefore
this
case
should
be
treated
strictly
as
a
free
speech
case
and
not
as
the
case
involving
symbolic
speech
or
conduct.
even
if
you
were
to
treat
this
as
a
symbolic
speech
case
and
apply
the
o’brien
test.
i
would
urge
that
this
statute
and
the
facts
in
this
case
both
on
their
face
and
as
applied
to
this
appellee
fail
the
o’brien
test
miserably
and
one
area
of
o’brien
test
which
was
the
track
that
i
was
on
was
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
i
can
think
of
but
three
state
interests
which
you
could
postulate
in
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
one
would
be
to
protect
against
breaches
of
the
peace.
clearly
this
statute
is
not
narrowly
drawn
enough
to
do
that
and
secondly,
it’s
very
clear
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
was
no
breach
of
the
peace
eminent
or
otherwise.
a
second
state
interest
might
be
to
protect
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes.
i
agree
to
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think
i
can
amplify
on
that.
there
was
no
general
demonstration.
there
was
a
normal
group
of
people
on
the
street
and
when
the
policeman
began
questioning
goguen
who
was
talking
to
this
group
of
people.
the
people
in
the
group
started
laughing.
but
this
was
not
a
demonstration
by
anyone
other
than
goguen.
we
contend
however
that
this
very
clearly
was
a
demonstration
of
one.
and
that
goguen
himself
was
expressing
opinion.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
and
that
--
i
think
i
can
amplify
in
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think
i
can
amplify
in
the
record
and
say
that
goguen
got
out,
left
his
house,
walked
down
town
and
met
some
friends
of
his
standing
around
the
street
corner
and
basically
that
was
the
group
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
goguen
is
still
engaging
an
expressive
conduct
here.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
when
the
officer
arrived
goguen
was
standing
talking
to
a
group
of
people.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
as
far
as
i
know
that
it
was
just
a
casual
conversation.
and
that
this
is
something
akin
to
the
situation
where
one
of
us
might
place
a
political
bumper
sticker
on
our
car
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
some
political
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
not
in
the
context,
not
in
the
limited
factual
context
of
the
group.
however
in
the
context
of
the
times,
one
can
certainly
infer
that
this
was
at
the
height
of
the
protest
movement.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no.
i
think
not
only
did
the
officer
take
exception
to
the
fact
that
the
flag
was
on
the
seat
of
goguen’s
pants
but
goguen
obviously
conveyed
to
the
officer
a
powerful
feeling
of
contempt
for
the
flag
and
in
fact,
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
necessarily
a
finding
by
the
jury
in
order
to
convict
goguen
that
he
was
expressing
contempt
for
the
flag.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
by
the
way
he
was
displaying.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
now
this
is
very
much
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
don’t
think
that
i
can
precisely
define
what
he
was
trying
to
express.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
that’s
correct
and
there
was
a
good
reason
for
that
at
the
time
which
doesn’t
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
he
did
not
testify
on
my
advice.
in
any
event,
what
he
was
trying
to
express
cannot
be
precisely
defined.
i
will
grant
you
however
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
think
i
can
show
it
from
what
he
did.
first
of
all
there
is
a
finding
on
the
part
of
the
jury
that
he
expressed
contempt
for
the
flag
and
this
court
had
said
in
street,
that
that
kind
of
an
expression
is
constitutionally
protected.
precise
expression
has
never
been
prerequisite
for
first
amendment
protection.
i
would
for
example
refer
you
to
the
papish
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
march.
in
the
papish
case,
the
defendant
was
displaying
a
cartoon
which
showed
--
and
among
other
things,
she
was
displaying
a
cartoon
which
showed
the
police
officer
raping
the
statue
of
liberty.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don’t
believe
you
had
a
record
of
the
full
trial
but
you
certainly
had
the
words
of
street
which
we
use
in
that
case.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
true
but
what
i’m
urging
upon
you
is
that
when
you
communicate
not
through
words
but
through
the
use
of
symbols.
a
black
armband
for
example
can
be
ambiguous.
a
red
flag
can
be
ambiguous.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no
but
in
the
tinker
case,
there
was
a
school
regulation
forbidding
the
display
for
black
armband.
in
the
stromberg
case,
there
was
a
statute
forbidding
the
display
of
a
red
flag
and
in
the
goguen
case
there
was
statute
forbidding
the
display
of
contemptuous
feelings
about
the
flag.
so
that
in
each
case,
there
is
a
proscription,
an
official
proscription
against
the
particular
symbolic
form
of
expression
which
the
actor
is
trying
to
use.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
don’t
believe
that
it
was
a
specific
school
regulation
against
the
wearing
of
armbands,
it
was
a
specific
school
regulation
against
engaging
in
certain
kinds
of
conduct
which
was
deemed
to
be
harmful
and
the
school
authorities
then
interpreted
the
wearing
of
the
black
armbands
as
being
harmful.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
apologize
if
i
misstated
it.
in
the
papish
case,
this
cartoon
which
shows
the
police
officer
raping
the
statue
of
liberty
could
certainly
be
subjected
to
varied
interpretations.
it
could
mean
for
example,
it
could
be
anti-police.
it
could
be
anti-law
enforcement
generally.
it
could
be
anti-america
and
the
fact
that
the
cartoon
is
susceptible
of
many
interpretations
did
not,
in
the
papish
case
relieve
it
of
constitutional
protection.
similarly,
i’d
urge
that
varied
forms
of
display
of
the
flag
which
express
contempt.
similarly
are
protected
even
though
you
can't
precisely
define
what
the
particular
actor
is
saying.
a
classic
example
is
poetry.
if
each
of
us
read
a
poem,
we
might
derive
a
different
meaning
from
the
words
of
the
poem.
in
that
sense,
the
poem
is
as
ambiguous
as
goguen’s
conduct
here
but
no
one
would
argue
that
that
a
poem
isn’t
constitutionally
protected
or
words
to
a
song.
i’d
like
to
get
back
to
the
state's
interest
in
prosecuting
goguen.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it’s
not
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes,
i
do.
it
was
decided
in
march
of
1973.
i
have
a

to

mr.
evan
t.
lawson
the
state
interest
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
--
is
the
states
interest
in
protecting
the
flag
in
and
off
itself
as
some
sort
of
a
symbol.
besides
the
fact
that
that
the
symbolic
significance
of
the
flag
has
been
recognized
certainly
by
this
court
in
halter
and
in
barnette,
the
court
also
has
recognized
that
the
state
has
no
interest.
the
government
has
no
interest
in
protecting
that
symbolic
significance
from
use
by
citizens.
barnette
expressly
i
think
said
that.

certainly
said
that.
chief

also
examined
a

state
interest
in

found
that
there
was
no

court
of
massachusetts.
in
massachusetts
this
appeal
was
pursuant
to
a
bill
of
exceptions
which
set
forth
a
summary
of
the
testimony.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
there
are
no
proceedings.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
there
is
no
record
of
the
proceedings.
they
have
only
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
rescript
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
it
had
no
record
before
of
what
it
transpired,
either
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
or
in
the
state
superior
court
where
the
jury
trial
took
place.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
it
had
nothing
--
it
had
nothing
more
than
the
bill
of
exceptions.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes.
it
didn’t
have
the
bill
of
exceptions
report.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
yes.
the
bill
of
exceptions
is
a
part
of
the
appendix
here
and
was
before
the
united
states
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
matter.
i
see
my
time
is
almost
up.
one
thing
that
i
would
suggest
to
you
is
that
if
there
is
an
interest
in
protecting
the
flag
in
and
of
itself.
that
interest
is
subjected
to
almost
limitless
extension.
if
you’re
going
to
protect
the
flag,
why
not
protect
the
state
seal
as
well
or
the
federal
seal?
why
not
protect
the
national
anthem
as
in
fact
michigan
has
a
statute
which
prohibits
playing
the
national
anthem
or
--
and
other
than
the
normal
notes
or
the
prescribed
notes.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no.
we
don’t
--
i
don’t
quarrel
with
that
at
all
in
slight.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
well,
i
would
say
that
that
is
the
reason.
i
think
the
rationale
behind
that
reason
is
that
they
could
--
there
is
a
finding
that
it’s
harmful
to
have
this
symbol
used
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
i
think
that
that’s
all
right
and
i
think
under
the
rational
or
under
the
broadrick
analysis
for
example,
there
is
no
problem
in
differentiating
between
the
two
because
as
in
here
and
broadrick
and
street
and
stromberg
and
tinker.
the
conduct
is
harmless.
it’s
passive.
it
doesn’t
impinge
on
the
rights
of
anyone
else.
when
you’re
talking
about
using
the
flag
or
using
the
state
seal
for
commercial
purposes
or
using
it
perhaps
reproducing
it
for
purposes
of
counterfeiting
or
something
of
that
sort
then
the
conduct
moves
from
the
area
of
being
harmless
into
the
area
of
being
harmful
and
state
does
have
an
interest
certainly
in
regulating
harmful
conduct
even
if
they’re
arguably
speech
elements
involved.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that’s
correct
and
the
reason
which
the
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
that
is
correct
and
i
think
the
reason
for
it,
is
that
a
passerby
seeing
the
state
seal
could
be
misled
for
example
on
to
thinking
that
that
whatever
the
product
was,
was
federally
approved
or
federally
sanctioned
and
then
that
would
be
--
could
be
harmful.
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no,
i
don’t
see.
i
don’t
think
that
from
the
point
of
view
--
mr.
evan
t.
lawson
no,
there
is
none.
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
don’t
think
that
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
and
consistent
with
the
history
of
this
country
that
one
can
say
that
that
is
constitutionally
permissible
to
punish
denigration.
the
whole
idea,
a
flag
desecration
implies
that
there
is
some
--
there
is
some
mistake
or
sacred
power
connected
with
the
flag
and
historically
of
course,
it
was
only
at
the
turn
of
this
century
that
there
was
any
legislation
at
all
passed
regulating
conduct
relating
to
the
flag.
england
in
a
thousand
years
of
history
has
never
regulated
conduct
concerning
its
flag.
so
that
our
tradition,
our
democratic
tradition
i
think
shies
away
from
that.
thank
you.
