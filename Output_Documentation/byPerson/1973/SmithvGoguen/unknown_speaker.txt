unknown
speaker
what
does
that
mean,
rescript
opinion?
unknown
speaker
what
section
is
state
leominster?
unknown
speaker
where
is
it
located?
unknown
speaker
no,
this
leominster,
where
is
that
town?
unknown
speaker
small
town?
unknown
speaker
was
the
respondent
or
rather
the
appellee
engaged
in
any
sort
of
demonstration
or
anything
such
--
unknown
speaker
and
so
i’m
afraid,
nothing
like
that
was
going
on,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
he
was
just
walking
down
the
street.
he
just
decided
that
day
to
–-
unknown
speaker
--
actually
the
american
flag
sewn
on
or
else
it
is
sewn
american
flag
on
the
pants
he
had,
just
to
dress
that
way
that
day
so
far
--
unknown
speaker
it
does
say,
he
was
with
a
group
of
persons
but
it
doesn’t
even
say
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
group
or
just
whether
he
was
--
there
were
other
people
standing
there
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
know?
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
is
definitely
mr.
chase.
the
vexillologist?
unknown
speaker
vexillologist?
what’s
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
his
testimony
about
the
origin
of
the
flag
and
the
difference
and
standards
that
this
one
didn’t
conform
to
the
official
standard?
what
was
the
significance?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
many
vexillologists
in
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
i
never
heard
of
one
of
until
a
few
minutes
ago.
unknown
speaker
do
you
and
then
i
suppose
you
further
argued
that
the
appellee’s
actions
in
this
case
did
so?
unknown
speaker
why
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
flag
was
sewn
on
his
trousers.
what
if
it
had
been
sewn
on
his
lapel?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
see
some
pretty
odd
costumes
these
days?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
you
affixed
it
to
the
rear
bumper
of
your
car?
unknown
speaker
i’ve
seen
bathing
suits
in
flag.
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chase,
your
argument,
i
think
leads
up
to
what
you
call
in
your
brief
a
description
of
the
statute
as
protecting
only
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
massachusetts
cases
even
in
lower
courts
which
so
describe
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
i
noticed
that
the
rescript
opinion
seems
so
light
primarily
on
federal
cases
and
cases
in
this
court.
aren’t
there
any
decisions
on
just
doing
the
statute
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
noticed
of
its
opinion
doesn’t
cite
any
massachusetts
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
there
any
prosecutions
under
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
you
suggested
earlier
there
are
number
of
arrests
for
violation
of
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
know
of
any
arrests?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
one
that
you
have
appended
to
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
yes,
mr.
richardson
so
appended.
unknown
speaker
as
i
recall
the
panel
of
the
first
circuit
contained
no
massachusetts
judge.
unknown
speaker
who
is
that?
judge
campbell?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
that
would
be
right
that
judges
coffin
and
mcentee
at
least
had
a
long
experience
dealing
with
massachusetts
problems,
haven’t
they?
unknown
speaker
problems?
unknown
speaker
well,
judge
hamley
was
from
the
ninth
circuit
but
i
thought
the
judges
coffin
and
mcentee
are
not
strangers
to
massachusetts’
law.
but
you
have
pointed
out
there
is
no
massachusetts
case
that
you
know
of?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
have
no
particular
familiarity
with
the
flag
statute?
unknown
speaker
a
best
seller?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
size?
unknown
speaker
under
that
order,
you
can
have
a
flag
of
any
size
just
long
as
the
proportions
are
confirmed
to
the
terms
of
the
order.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
say
that
forbids
the
state
from
making
a
criminal
act
that
out
of
flag
discretion
as
long
as
the
state
identifies
the
flag
in
--
unknown
speaker
of
course
in
this
case,
we
don’t
know
what
the
proportions
were
because
it
was
either
three
by
five
or
four
by
six
and
those
are
different
--
unknown
speaker
--
proportions.
unknown
speaker
did
it
appear
whether
goguen
himself
sewed
this
flag
--
unknown
speaker
--
that
is
seen
in
his
pants
or
was
manufactured
pants
with
a
flag
on
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lawson,
does
any
part
of
your
presentation
here
depend
on
what
you
described
as
this
misprint
in
the
record
because
i
can
imagine
some
problem?
i
gather
your
opposition
counsel
wasn’t
present
at
the
trial
and
--
unknown
speaker
--
oh,
that
there
maybe
some
problems
as
to
any
sort
of
a
stipulation
or
anything
like
that.
unknown
speaker
has
the
respondent
served
any
part
of
that
six
months
sentence?
unknown
speaker
but
those
other
prosecutions
result
in
convictions
and
secondly,
if
so,
is
there
any
record
of
them
in
any
printed
court
opinions?
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
what’s
the
significance
as
precedent
in
massachusetts
practice
of
a
rescript
opinion?
unknown
speaker
was
that
opinion
rendered
after
in
all
argument?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that’s
on
the
assumption
that
you
raised
before
judge
campbell
in
the
district
court,
the
same
things
that
the
first
circuit
ultimately
went
off.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lawson,
you
mentioned
having
tried
a
couple
of
flag
burning
cases,
you
said
they
were
different
factually,
obviously
they
are.
if
you
had
a
flag
burning
case
here
this
morning,
would
you
be
making
the
same
arguments,
one
as
to
vagueness
and
two
as
to
the
first
amendment
that
you
make
in
your
briefs?
unknown
speaker
you’re
saying
that
maybe
a
different
state
interest
in
a
flag
burning
case
from
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
your
view
is
that
the
state
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
a
flag
from
physical
or
other
desecration
in
anyway
whatsoever?
unknown
speaker
we’re
assuming,
we’re
assuming
during
all
of
this
that
the
flag
is
--
not
somebody,
it
doesn’t
belong
to
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
a
big
property
or
somebody
else’s
property?
unknown
speaker
the
facts
of
this
case
such
as
we
have
them
in
a
very
fragmentary
and
skimpy
way?
unknown
speaker
when
he
indicates
that
he
was
with
the
group,
was
there
some
sort
of
demonstration
or
another?
unknown
speaker
was
this
so
called
group,
just
the
strangers
who
are
ordinarily
on
the
street
or
where
they
--
unknown
speaker
--
self-appointed
group?
unknown
speaker
what
was
going
on,
when
the
officer?
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
the
casual
conversation?
unknown
speaker
and
this
wasn’t
in
the
context
of
the
vietnam
war
protesters,
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
we
to
suppose
that
the
officer
then
simply
took
exception
to
the
fact
that
the
flag
was
on
the
seat
of
the
pants?
unknown
speaker
merely
by
wearing
it
or
because
of
something
he
was
saying?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
did
he
testify?
unknown
speaker
that’s
right
--
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
in
the
tinker
case,
there
was
a
specific
school
regulation
against
the
wearing
of
armband?
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently
i
misunderstood
your
former
statement.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do,
you’ve
talked
a
couple
of
times
about
the
papish
case.
unknown
speaker
and
i’m
not
familiar
with
it,
do
you
have
a
citation?
unknown
speaker
part
of
branzburg?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
with
branzburg?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you
meant
that
missouri,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
papish
v.
who?
unknown
speaker
1197?
unknown
speaker
and
it
came
from
--
by
the
district
court?
the
three-judge
district
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
the
court
of
appeals
citation?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
1993
supreme
court
1197.
unknown
speaker
which
was
judge
lumbard’s
case?
unknown
speaker
are
the
proceedings
of
the
trial
at
large
here
the
evidence,
the
transcript
to
the
testimony?
unknown
speaker
are
there
proceedings
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
here?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
any
record?
is
there
record
involved?
unknown
speaker
so
the
district
court
here
didn’t
have
that
record
before
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
bill
of
exceptions
is
summarized
the
testimony
though.
unknown
speaker
and
the
district
court
didn’t
have
that
report.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
want,
that’s
what
i
asked.
is
the
bill
of
exceptions
filed
here?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
general
chase
just
so
i
can
declare
--
tell
me
if
i’m
wrong.
as
i
understood,
the
provisions
of
section
5,
under
which
mr.
goguen
was
convicted,
were
these,
whoever
publicly
treats
contemptuously
the
flag
of
the
united
states,
wasn’t
that
it?
unknown
speaker
not
physically
dishonor
or
physically?
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
statutory
language?
unknown
speaker
publicly
treats
contemptuously
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
you
are
in
supreme
court
didn’t
rely
on
that,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
such
as
mutilate,
trample
upon,
defaces.
unknown
speaker
but
the
physical
desecration,
what
you
say
the
statute
is
complying
to
has
to
be
a
desecration
that
publicly
cast
contempt
on
the
flag,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
he
is
still
--
it’s
still
involved
in
the
statute
is
a
communication
process?
unknown
speaker
communication
process,
the
desecration
has
to
be
contemptuous
of
the
flag,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
did
the
instruction
of
the
jury
in
this
case
say
that
the
defendant
had
that,
the
jury
has
to
find
that
defendant
intended
to
cast
--
unknown
speaker
they
have
intended
to
cast
contempt
on
the
flag.
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
end
that
he
did
it?
unknown
speaker
you
just
don’t
have
it
and
you
don’t
have
an
urge,
no
extent
record
of
the
instruction
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
notice
that
apparently
the
defendant
files
certain
request
for
instructions
including
at
least
three
and
four
were
denied
so
something
less
that
the
defendant
requested
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
mean,
rescript
opinion?
unknown
speaker
what
section
is
state
leominster?
unknown
speaker
where
is
it
located?
unknown
speaker
no,
this
leominster,
where
is
that
town?
unknown
speaker
small
town?
unknown
speaker
was
the
respondent
or
rather
the
appellee
engaged
in
any
sort
of
demonstration
or
anything
such
--
unknown
speaker
and
so
i’m
afraid,
nothing
like
that
was
going
on,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
he
was
just
walking
down
the
street.
he
just
decided
that
day
to
–-
unknown
speaker
--
actually
the
american
flag
sewn
on
or
else
it
is
sewn
american
flag
on
the
pants
he
had,
just
to
dress
that
way
that
day
so
far
--
unknown
speaker
it
does
say,
he
was
with
a
group
of
persons
but
it
doesn’t
even
say
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
group
or
just
whether
he
was
--
there
were
other
people
standing
there
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
know?
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
is
definitely
mr.
chase.
the
vexillologist?
unknown
speaker
vexillologist?
what’s
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
his
testimony
about
the
origin
of
the
flag
and
the
difference
and
standards
that
this
one
didn’t
conform
to
the
official
standard?
what
was
the
significance?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
many
vexillologists
in
massachusetts?
unknown
speaker
i
never
heard
of
one
of
until
a
few
minutes
ago.
unknown
speaker
do
you
and
then
i
suppose
you
further
argued
that
the
appellee’s
actions
in
this
case
did
so?
unknown
speaker
why
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
flag
was
sewn
on
his
trousers.
what
if
it
had
been
sewn
on
his
lapel?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
see
some
pretty
odd
costumes
these
days?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
you
affixed
it
to
the

belong
to
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
a
big
property
or
somebody
else’s
property?
unknown
speaker
the
facts
of
this
case
such
as
we
have
them
in
a
very
fragmentary
and
skimpy
way?
unknown
speaker
when
he
indicates
that
he
was
with
the
group,
was
there
some
sort
of
demonstration
or
another?
unknown
speaker
was
this
so
called
group,
just
the
strangers
who
are
ordinarily
on
the
street
or
where
they
--
unknown
speaker
--
self-appointed
group?
unknown
speaker
what
was
going
on,
when
the
officer?
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
the
casual
conversation?
unknown
speaker
and
this
wasn’t
in
the
context
of
the
vietnam
war
protesters,
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
we
to
suppose
that
the
officer
then
simply
took
exception
to
the
fact
that
the
flag
was
on
the
seat
of
the
pants?
unknown
speaker
merely
by
wearing
it
or
because
of
something
he
was
saying?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
did
he
testify?
unknown
speaker
that’s
right
--
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
in
the
tinker
case,
there
was
a
specific
school
regulation
against
the
wearing
of
armband?
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently
i
misunderstood
your
former
statement.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do,
you’ve
talked
a
couple
of
times
about
the
papish
case.
unknown
speaker
and
i’m
not
familiar
with
it,
do
you
have
a
citation?
unknown
speaker
part
of
branzburg?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
with
branzburg?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you
meant
that
missouri,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
papish
v.
who?
unknown
speaker
1197?
unknown
speaker
and
it
came
from
--
by
the
district
court?
the
three-judge
district
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
the
court
of
appeals
citation?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
1993
supreme
court
1197.
unknown
speaker
which
was
judge
lumbard’s
case?
unknown
speaker
are
the
proceedings
of
the
trial
at
large
here
the
evidence,
the
transcript
to
the
testimony?
unknown
speaker
are
there
proceedings
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
here?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
any
record?
is
there
record
involved?
unknown
speaker
so
the
district
court
here
didn’t
have
that
record
before
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
bill
of
exceptions
is
summarized
the
testimony
though.
unknown
speaker
and
the
district
court
didn’t
have
that
report.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
want,
that’s
what
i
asked.
is
the
bill
of
exceptions
filed
here?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
general
chase
just
so
i
can
declare
--
tell
me
if
i’m
wrong.
as
i
understood,
the
provisions
of
section
5,
under
which
mr.
goguen
was
convicted,
were
these,
whoever
publicly
treats
contemptuously
the
flag
of
the
united
states,
wasn’t
that
it?
unknown
speaker
not
physically
dishonor
or
physically?
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
statutory
language?
unknown
speaker
publicly
treats
contemptuously
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
you
are
in
supreme
court
didn’t
rely
on
that,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
such
as
mutilate,
trample
upon,
defaces.
unknown
speaker
but
the
physical
desecration,
what
you
say
the
statute
is
complying
to
has
to
be
a
desecration
that
publicly
cast
contempt
on
the
flag,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
he
is
still
--
it’s
still
involved
in
the
statute
is
a
communication
process?
unknown
speaker
communication
process,
the
desecration
has
to
be
contemptuous
of
the
flag,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
did
the
instruction
of
the
jury
in
this
case
say
that
the
defendant
had
that,
the
jury
has
to
find
that
defendant
intended
to
cast
--
unknown
speaker
they
have
intended
to
cast
contempt
on
the
flag.
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
end
that
he
did
it?
unknown
speaker
you
just
don’t
have
it
and
you
don’t
have
an
urge,
no
extent
record
of
the
instruction
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
notice
that
apparently
the
defendant
files
certain
request
for
instructions
including
at
least
three
and
four
were
denied
so
something
less
that
the
defendant
requested
i
gather.
