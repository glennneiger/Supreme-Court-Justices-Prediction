period,
wasn't

justice
potter
stewart
but

justice
potter
stewart
i
think,
we
have
to
get
a
case
in
our
court
involving
american
soldiers
who
were
taken
prisoners
during
the
korean
hostility
saying
that
there's
no
defense
anyway
then
until
or
unless
you're
terminated
from
the
service
is
an
obligation
to
pay
your
salary?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
you
are
a
deserter
or
a
prisoner
war
or
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
simply
wouldn't
be
a
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
valid
case.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
the
case
mr.
solicitor
general
on
which
the
district
court
said
that

least

the

no
longer
anything
to
be
taken
very
seriously
or

that
effect.

like
that.
