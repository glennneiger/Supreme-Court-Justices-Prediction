mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
try
to
please
the
court
in
just
a
regard
if
i
can.
this
was
a
suit
brought
by
the
respondents,
the
reservists
committee
to
stop
the
war
in
several
named
members
of
the
military
reserve.
in
order
to
compel
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
secretaries
in
the
army,
navy
and
air
force,
to
remove
active
--
remove
congressmen
now
in
office
from
the
military
reserves
and
to
reclaim
paying
for
other
remedies
not
now
in
issue.
the
theory
of
the
case
is
that
the
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2,
which
the
second
half
that
clause
which
states
“no
person
holding
any
office
under
the
united
states,
shall
be
a
member
of
either
house
during
his
continuance
in
office."
clearly
the
case
is,
that
clause
places
an
obligation
upon
the
executive
branch
enforceable
by
the
courts
to
purge
from
the
reserve
ranks
all
congressmen
and
then
in
office.
the
courts
of
appeals
held
for
the
plaintiffs
the
respondents
here
in
a
summary
judgment
denying
the
government
summary
judgment
and
issue
the
declaratory
judgment
only.
the
court
--
i
am
sorry
--
the
district
court
did
that.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
opinion
except
for
one
remark
concerning
standing
which
we
will
come
to.
the
government
will
urge
reversal
hereupon
each
of
three
grounds.
we
will
urge
that
under
first
that
under
no
theory
of
standing
have
these
respondents
standing
to
maintain
this
action
either
as
taxpayers
or
as
citizens.
we
will
argue
second
that
the
question
of
whether
a
reserve
commission
is
an
office
that
disqualifies
it's
holder
from
membership
in
congress
is
an
issue
of
qualification
for
membership
of
congress
and
therefore
by
article
i,
section
5,
clause
1,
is
committed
to
the
exclusive
determination
of
the
house
in
which
the
member
sets
it
is
a
political
question
and
therefore,
nonjusticiable.
we
will
contend
finally
that
membership
in
the
reserves
particularly
of
the
type
involved
here
is
under
no
--
is
under
no
construction
of
the
word
“office”
and
“office”
within
the
meeting
of
the
constitutional
provision
employed.
we
have
discussed
standing
in
--
at
length
in
our
brief.
and
in
october,
in
the
richardson
case,
it
was
discussed
at
length,
and
i
think
it's
possible
to
fairly
brief
about
the
standing
issue
here
is
a
straightforward
one.
respondents
complained,
claim
standing
as
citizen
and
taxpayers.
and
the
injury
alleged
is
at
the
presence
of
congressmen
in
the
military
reserves
deprives
respondents
of
a
right
to
unbiased
consideration.
this
is
a
quotation
from
their
brief
“of
majors
before
the
congress
affecting
the
military
establishment
and
appropriations
therefore
and
majors
relating
to
military
action,
war
and
peace.”
the
district
court
as
i
say
denied
taxpayers
standing
but
granted
citizenship
standing.
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
cited
flast
against
cohen
and
does
seem
to
say
that
perhaps
there
was
taxpayers
standing
here
as
well
as
citizenship
standing.
i
think
it's
clear
that
there
no
standing
exist
under
either
theory.
our
brief
discusses
cases
such
as
the
students
challenge
the
regulatory
agency
procedures,
the
scrap
case
and
it's
a
--
we
discussed
at
some
length
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
extended
the
concept
of
standing
by
adding
to
the
kinds
of
injuries
that
may
be
considered.
but
so
far
as
we
know
there's
never
been
a
case
that
says,
there
need
not
be
direct
injury
specific
and
perceptible
harm
is
never
been
enough
in
this
court
were
a
plaintiff
to
alleged
an
interest
in
good
government
or
in
constitutional
principles.
and
we
think
that's
absolutely
clear
from
the
brief
and
from
frothingham
against
mellon,
the
sierra
club
case,
scrap
case,
ex
parte
levitt,
and
so
on.
a
respondent's
attempt
evade
this
body
of
law
with
the
contention
that
there
complain
alleges
very
specific
injuries
and
those
very
specific
injuries
turn
out
to
be
their
inability
to
influence
congress
which
is
not
specified,
we
don't
exactly
how
they
were
unable
to
influence
congress.
and
an
inability
they
say
to
join
with
others
in
an
effort
to
make
political
advocacy
effective.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
is
the
part
of
the
allegation
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
is
an
allegation
that
fails
because
it
is
entirely
speculative.
we
don't
know
specifically
what
measures
where
affected
by
this
attitude.
we
do
not
even
know
in
fact
that
the
attitude
exists.
respondents
assume
a
one-way
relationship
between
the
membership
and
the
reserves
and
the
political
attitude.
the
respondents
themselves
are
reserve
as
to
appear
the
whole
political
attitude
is
not
in
conformity
with
those
they
alleged
that
congressmen
hold
or
the
reserves.
the
other
point
about
that
statement
however
is
that
the
citation
in
naacp
versus
button
is
--
only
beside
the
point
because
there
is
no
allegation
here
and
either
could
we
not
with
anybody,
and
most
particularly
not
the
congress
has
taken
any
action
which
prevents
respondents
from
joining
together
to
make
their
political
advocacy
effective.
the
only
claim
is
an
attitudinal
claim,
a
claim
about
the
attitudes
of
congress
or
about
congressional
reservists.
so
that
for
these
reasons,
they
have
alleged
the
most
specific
injury,
no
specific
action.
secondly,
they
are
really
complaining
about
attitudes
that
don't
correspond
to
their
own.
and
assume
as
i
say
a
simple
one-way
relationship
but
is
not
shown
and
i
don't
think
it
could
be
shown.
and
indeed
it
occurs
to
me,
because
i
think
about
that,
that
i
don't
know
how
long
we
try
an
issue
like
that.
if
you
try
to
make
a
question
of
congressional
attitudes,
a
question
of
fact
to
show
an
injury,
you
would
have
to
try
the
issue
of
congressional
motivation
on
particular
pieces
of
legislation,
the
motivation
of
individual
congressmen
and
that's
an
issue
which
this
court
have
en
loath
to
get
into
at
least
of
fletcher
against
peck
in
1810.
finally,
i
think
it's
clear
that
respondents
are
asserting
no
more
than
the
interest
of
citizens
in
the
conduct
of
government,
and
that
is
precise
to
the
interest
to
this
case
as
this
court
has
again
begin
in
baker
against
carr
and
ex
parte
levitt
said
“it
does
not
suffice
to
confer
standing.”
i
think
the
political
nature
of
respondents
theory
of
standing
and
what
the
breads
of
that
theory
really
appears
that
in
page
ten
of
their
brief
in
which
they
discussed
the
fact
to
this
court,
by
expanding
the
concepts
of
standing
has
done
much
to
permit
grievances
of
private
citizens
against
something
describe
as
an
increasingly
all-powerful
government
to
be
litigated
in
the
courts
and
not
fought
in
the
streets.
so
i
take
it
as
a
general
right
of
petition
by
citizens
directed
to
the
court
that
is
advocated
here
for
political
grievance,
and
that
is
a
theory
of
standing
the
court
has
never
accepted.
and
i
think
should
not
accept
or
obvious
article
iii
policy
reasons.
they
do
attempt
to
analogize
their
case
to
baker
against
carr,
that
however
was
a
case
in
which
under
represented
citizens
could
prove
arithmetically
that
their
votes
were
be
valued
as
much
as
if
their
balance
have
been
burned
or
the
voting
age
have
been
raised
selectively
for
their
counties
and
we
have
already
seen
the
reasons
why
that
kind
of
perceptible,
calculable
injury
is
not
present
in
this
case.
i
should
say
about
ex
parte
levitt,
the
respondents
say,
albeit,
in
their
brief
on
page
16,
that
levitt's
only
interest
in
seeking
the
disqualification
of
mr.
justice
black
on
the
first
section
of
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2
about
senators
are
not
being
appointed
to
civil
office.
a
more
image
being
been
increased
during
the
time
he
was
a
senator.
they
say
of
that,
that
mr.
levitt's
status
was
only
that
of
a
member
of
the
bar
and
he
did
not
assert
with
justice
black's
alleged
ineligibility
could
in
any
way
deprive
him
levitt
of
unbiased
consideration
by
the
court.
the
moving
papers
on
that
case
is
a
matter
of
fact
state
only
that
mr.
levitt
was
a
member
of
this
bar
of
this
court,
however
the
court
took
it
in
the
opinion
as
both
a
citizenship
claim
and
a
member
of
the
bar
claim
and
this
allowed
standing
in
the
case.
i
think
it
would
be
instructed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
a
petition
filed
directly
in
this
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it's
a
--
it's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
wasn't
the
complaint
mr.
justice
douglas,
it
was
just
a
motion
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
was
a
motion
to
have
the
court
issue
an
order
to
show
a
cause
why
mr.
justice
black
should
not
be
disqualified
from
sitting
on
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
be
instructive
i
think
to
imagine
whether
the
result
would
have
been
any
different
in
that
petition
had
mr.
levitt
alleged
that
this
clause
was
designed
to
eliminate
bias
and
then
mr.
justice
black's
service
in
the
senate
was
likely
to
biased
in
favor
of
broad
national
powers,
a
position
which
mr.
levitt
did
not
like.
i
think
i
cannot
believe
at
that
allegation
which
would
make
this
case,
which
would
make
the
levitt
case
just
like
the
case
before
us
would
have
been
enough
to
get
mr.
levitt's
standing
in
that
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
indeed
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
in
that
sense
he
would
have
a
much
better
claim
to
standing
than
the
respondents
here
have.
but
if
you
turn
to
it
as
citizenship
standing
in
the
levitt
case
and
make
the
additional
allegation
that
i
have
supposed
that
as
a
citizen
he
was
disturbed
by
the
judicial
attitudes
of
mr.
justice
black
and
that
he
could
not
report
with,
perhaps
do
things
that
he
disapprove
of
politically
or
judicially
or
some
other
way.
i
don't
think
that
allegation
would
have
conferred
standing
in
the
levitt
case
and
yet
that
allegation
makes
the
standing
issue
there
precisely
the
same
as
it
is
in
this
case.
flast
against
cohen,
i
will
say
only
the
taxpayer
does
--
standing
here
does
not
exist
because
flast
against
cohen
lays
down
two
requirements.
the
first
is,
that
the
congressional
action
challenge
must
have
been
an
action
under
the
taxing
and
spending
clause.
and
second
is
that
the
action
must
be
in
derogation
of
a
constitutional
provision
which
was
intended
to
operate
as
a
restriction
upon
the
taxing
and
spending
power,
neither
of
those
is
true
here
obviously
because,
the
status
of
congressmen
as
reservists
is
not
congressional
action
under
the
taxing
and
spending
clause.
and
the
second
test
is
not
met
for
the
reason
that
this
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2
is
obviously
as
i
think
both
sides
in
this
case
agree,
designed
to
prevent
the
executive
domination
of
the
legislative
branch.
it
is
not
designed
to
limit
the
taxing
and
spending
power,
now
the
district
court
denied
taxing.
taxpayers
standing,
emphasizing
this
ground
and
i
would
refer
the
court,
if
i
may
to
pages
29
and
30
of
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
where
the
district
court
is
reasoning
upon
that
point
is
contained.
i
will
not
dwell
upon.
i
think
the
article
iii
reasons
why
standing
remains
the
crucial
concept
to
the
function
of
constitutional
review
or
judicial
review.
a
concept
that
requires
that
cases
come
up
in
specific
factual
context
which
are
instructive
as
to
what
general
principles
mean
and
to
prevent
to
federal
court
to
be
drawn
in
the
philosophic
debates
immediately
after
the
passage
of
legislation
before
anybody
can
show
any
direct
specific
harm
or
how
the
legislation
works.
i
would
like
instead
the
pass
if
i
may
to
the
second
of
our
arguments
which
is
that
this
claim
is
a
political
question
which
is
therefore
nonjusticiable.
as
baker
against
carr,
tells
us
a
political
question
arises
among
other
ways
when
there's
a
textually
demonstrable
commitment
of
an
issue
to
a
board
and
branch
of
government.
and
the
qualification
clause
under
article
i
section
5,
clause
1,
states
that
each
house
shall
be
the
judge
of
the
elections,
returns
and
qualifications
of
its
own
members.
the
only
question
therefore
is
whether
the
second
half
of
article
i
section
6,
clause
2,
states
a
qualification
for
membership
in
congress
that
does,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
it
is
a
nonjusticiable
issue,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
douglas.
but,
if
congress
is
the
exclusive
judge
of
this
issue
--
then
i
think
the
--
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
but
--
but
in
order
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
quite
correct.
it
is
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
quite
correct.
however
the
issue
of
the
qualifications
will
have
to
be
decided
by
the
court
in
order
to
order
--
to
issue
an
order
to
the
executive
branch
to
remove
these
reservists
--
these
congressmen
from
the
reserve
rules,
so
that
the
court
would
happen
necessarily
to
judge
the
issue
which
we
think
is
committed
exclusively
to
the
congress.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
by
that
you
mean,
if
he
has
been
seated
by
congress
and
still
there
the
congress,
in
that
sense,
judge
the
issue.
i
think
you
need
to
go
no
further
because
i
think
the
issue
is
solely
for
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
i
don't
think
that
would
be
different.
the
reason
i
don't
is,
that
is
seems
to
me
of
the
issue
was
exclusively
committed
to
congress
then
distinction
is
like
that
or
not
for
the
court,
they
might
be
for
congress.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
douglas
that
is
a
very
good
question.
let
me
just
--
that
--
if
he
suited
for
his
salary
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
i
would
--
i
think
i
would
say
that
probably
would
not
be
a
justiciable
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
so
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
so
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
so,
but
i
think
that
if
the
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
reached
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
the
other
way,
i
think
they
would
--
i
think
in
fairness
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
i
would
have
to
say,
should
the
court
decide
where
defense
i
would
think
it
will
not
be
a
justiciable
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
quite
right
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
a
question
however
the
test
--
the
--
the
test
limits
of
my
theory
i
must
say.
but
i
think
that
it
is
a
--
it
would
be
nonjusticiable
if
it
were
a
defense.
but
i
think
it's
easy
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
a
qualification
for
congress.
this
court
has
never
passed
upon
(voice

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
congress,
mr.
chief
justice
has
--
has
vacated
seats
and
expelled
members
upon
the
ground
that
other
kinds
of
commissions
in
the
armed
services
were
incompatible
with
the

in

did
constitute

mr.

the
matter
is
not
close,
repeatedly
congress
has
acted
under
these
clause
to
vacate
seats
and
is
recently
is
1963,
the
senate
passed
a
resolution
which
was
acted
upon
requesting
the
senate
judiciary
committee
to
consider
the
issue
of
reserved
memberships.
i
think
the
issue
is
too
clear
actually
for
a
much
discussion,
i
think
when
i
--
the
facts
of
the
kinds
of
reserve
commissions
that
these
congressmen
hold
are
such
that,
nobody
would
conclude
that
there
were
officers
on
the
united
states.
so
that
i
think
congress'
recent
inaction
is
entirely
executable.
but
i
--i
would
like
to
reserve
the
facts
of
those
for
the
moment
to
a
demonstration
that
in
fact
this
does
did
a
qualification.
the
text
and
structure
of
this
statute,
“no
person
holding
any
office
shall
be
a
member.”
sounds
very
much
like
a
qualification
for
a
membership
in
congress
and
indeed
that
is
precisely
the
same
structure
that
the
constitution
uses
in
article
i
sections
2
and
3
when
it
states
“no
person
shall
be
a
member
of
the
house”
states
the
age
and
the
residence
requirements
and
so
forth.
in
addition
to
that,
if
you
look
at
the
two
parts
of
article
i
section
6,
clause
2,
the
first
part
says,
“no
senator
or
representative
shall
be
appointed
to
office
in
the
certain
circumstances.
the
second
half
says
“no
person
who
is
on
office
shall
be
a
senator,
a
member
of
either
house.
so,
that
obviously
the
first
part
states
a
qualification
for
office
and
the
second
part
states
a
qualification
for
a
membership
in
the
house.
and
we
know
of
the
age
and
residence
requirements
of
articles
i
sections
2
and
3
for
the
house
and
senate
are
not
the
exclusive
statements
of
qualifications
because
of
the
case
of
roudebush
v.
hartke
where
it
is
stated
that
indeed
the
17th
amendment
states
a
qualification.
i
think
the
history
of
the
adoption
of
this
claus
is
adequately
treated
in
our
brief
on
pages
34
and
35.
i
think
the
history
of
the
way
this
clause
came
into
being
demonstrates
that
it
was
intended
as
a
qualification
for
a
membership
in
the
house,
and
that
this
different
way
of
stating
the
two-halves
of
the
clause
was
intentional
and
indeed
i
would
refer
the
court
particularly
to
the
quotation
on
page
35
of
our
brief
of
number
30
--
number
52
of
the
federal
list
in
which
james
madison
listed
this
precise
part
of
article
i
section
6,
clause
2
as
a
qualification
for
a
congressmen.
beyond
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
white
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
white
i
--
i
thought
we
were
discussing
the
first-half
of
the
clause.
the
president
certainly
could
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that's
all
it
does
to
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it's
optional
with
the
executive,
should
he
decide
that
it's
bad
policy
to
have
two
offices
of
any
kind.
i
don't
think
this
is
not
as
for
two
positions
of
any
kind
combined
but
i
don't
think
is
an
already
an
obligation
to
refuse
reserve
membership
to
congressmen
i
think
both
because
i
think
this
is
not
an
option
of
states
but
more
importantly
in
the
present
context
because
it
is
a
political
question
committed
to
congressmen.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
so,
i
don't
believe
so,
oh
--
oh
you
mean
necessarily
assume.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
depends
on
which
issue
you
reach
first
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
i
could
not
honestly
answer
that,
the
affirmative
necessarily
assumed
that
to
get
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
so
to
speak.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
entirely
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
entirely
correct,
if
--
if
one
takes
that
is
an
arguendo
position
that
is
entirely
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
an
addition
in
our
brief
which
i
shall
not
re
--
recapitulate.
a
lengthy
history
of
congresses
the
treatment
of
article
i
section
6,
clause
2
as
a
--
as
a
qualification
over
which
it
has
exclusive
control,
the
earliest
case
which
is
cited
is
that
of
--
in
1803
of
representative
van
ness,
respondents
cite
that
case
to
argue
that
the
militia
commission
there
involved
was
like
a
reserve
commission
today,
i
don't
know
about
that,
i
don't
know
the
historical
record
well
enough
on
the
record
i
have
doesn't
disclose
enough
about
that
militia
commission.
be
that
as
it
may,
what
it
does
show
is
that
congress
thought
it
had
control
of
that
issue
as
a
qualification
issue
and
that
--
these
early
cases
which
on
our
brief
are
really
quite
important
because
there
are
very
close
to
the
time
of
constitutional
convention
and
the
congress
clearly
thought,
it
was
in
control
of
this
issue.
and,
i
should
stress
that
congress
also
has
thought
that
it
decides
the
meaning
of
this
clause
as
well
as
the
facts
as
in
--
we
--we
show
on
our
brief
on
page
39
that
in
1806
for
example,
the
congress
decided
that
a
government
contractor
was
not
an
officer
within
the
meaning
of
this
clause.
i
should
say
that
respondent's
brief
on
this
point
seems
to
me
to
contain
to
non
sequitur.
pages
28
and
29,
the
respondents
argue
from
the
purpose
of
the
incompatibility
clause
which
is
to
ensure
the
separation
of
the
executive
legislator
branches.
then
in
the
middle
of
page
29,
they
say
the
purpose
is
obviously
equally
well
served
and
incompatibility
eliminated
whether
the
one
office
or
the
other
is
vacated.
hence,
the
incompatibility
clause
operates
as
a
restrain
on
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative.
both
are
under
on
equal
obligations,
i
think
that
is
a
non
sequitur
of
course
if
there
is
a
--
an
incompatibility,
i
think
there
is
not,
it
would
be
cured
equally
whether
the
legislature
or
the
executive
operator
but
that
kind
of
argument
means
that
there
is
no
issue
in
the
exclusive
control
of
another
court
and
branch
of
government
because
you
can
always
say
well,
whenever
is
--
whatever
is
troublesome,
is
cured
equally
well,
if
the
court
acts
instead
of
the
congress
of
if
the
executive
acts
instead
of
the
congress.
so
the
statement
to
that,
the
incompatibility
if
it
exists
would
be
eliminated
if
the
executive
were
required
to
act
in
no
way
demonstrates
that
the
issue
in
fact
is
committed
to
the
executive
or
to
the
courts
and
the
constitution
we
think
the
fact
demonstrates
the
contrary,
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
say
just
a
word
in
conclusion
about
what
these
reserve
commissions
are,
because
i
think
they
have
been
overstated.
we
have
here,
in
the
active
standby
reserve
which
i
think
is
the
only
reserve
status
that
can
even
arguably
be
called
an
office,
20
members
of
congress
in
the
inactive
standby
reserve,
we
have
12
members
of
congress.
i
won't
mention
the
inactive
standby
reserve
again
because
the
inactive
standby
reserve
receives
nothing
and
may
not
train
even
if
he
volunteers
for
it.
it's
an
honorary
status.
then
we
have
58
members
of
congress
who
are
retired
without
pay
and
i
take
of
one,
i've
got
to
include
them
on
this.
they
are
in
107
congressmen
we're
talking
about,
but
they
certainly
is
can
hardly
be
called
an
office
to
be
retired
without
pay,
there
are
16
congressmen
retired
with
pay
of
them
six
are
retired
for
disability,
ten
for
after
period
of
service.
so
we
have
at
20
reservists
in
the
active
standby.
now,
i
think
it's
demonstrable
that
in
the
active
standby
that
is
not
only
--
not
an
office
on
united
states
but
there
is
no
executive
control
over
these
men.
and,
recall
the
hardwell
case
which
is
discussed
in
both
briefs
which
suggested
that
an
office
on
the
united
states
is
defined
by
tenure
duration,
emolument
and
duties.
none
of
these
categories
accept
the
active
standby
has
any
possibility
of
falling
within
that
definition.
an
active
standby
reserve
may
apply
for
training
but
it's
entirely
voluntary.
he's
not
called
up,
he
receives
no
pay
while
he
is
in
training.
he
receives
no
allowances,
he
pays
for
his
own
food,
he
plays
--
pays
for
his
own
uniform.
he
pays
for
his
own
travel.
the
only
expense
for
the
government
involved
as
opposed
to
going
to
the
firing
range
and
use
up
ammunition.
but
one
thing
he
can
do
is
by
training
regularly
at
his
own
expense,
is
acquire
training
points
towards
retirement.
he
gets
one
training
point
if
he
volunteers
for
this
training,
for
each
four-hour
drill
and
one
training
point
for
each
day
of
summer
activity.
and
if
he
gets
a
minimum
of
50
for
20
years,
he
then
gets
a
relatively
small
pension
at
the
age
of
60
but
that
is
the
entire
financial
connection
that
any
of
these
reservist
has
and
it's
very
small
and
very
few
congressmen
indeed
goes
to
that
training.
now,
the
respondents
i
have
cited
on
pages
40
and
41
of
their
brief
elements
of
executive
control
over
these
reservists.
i
think
i
have
shown
just
a
right
little,
but
let
me
take
them
by
category.
the
respondents
state
that
these
reservists
are
subject
to
call
by
the
president.
that
is
true,
only
with
respect
to
the
ready
reserve
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
one
congressman
in
the
ready
reserve.
he
can
be
removed
from
that
only
with
the
consent
of
a
governor
of
his
state
because
it's
a
national
guard
position,
he
is
not
involved
in
this
case
because
the
case
is
against
the
governor
or
him.
of
the
active
standby
reserve,
they
can
be
called
by
the
president
only
if
congress
declares
a
natural
--
national
emergency
or
war
under
10
united
states
code
section
6782.
so
they
are
not
a
subject
to
call
by
the
president
unless
congress
authorizes
the
call
as
the
salaries
and
expenses,
there
are
none,
there
is
a
very
small
possibility
for
some
of
them
of
a
small
pension
at
the
end
of
20
years.
if
the
respondents
say
that
they
are
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
the
only
time,
any
of
these
reserves
is
so
subject
is
when
he
is
on
--
when
he
has
voluntarily
gone
into
training
and
voluntarily
submitted
himself
to
the
code.
the
retired
reservist
is
subject
to
the
code
only
when
he
is
receiving
hospitalization.
there
is
a
mention
of
the
enlistment
term
--
enlistment
term
and
the
oath
unless
one
of
these
congressmen
is
in
the
reserve
because
he
has
a
remaining
obligation
after
having
been
drafted.
he
has
no
term
and
can
resign,
in
the
oath
he
takes
is
simply
the
one
we
all
take
to
support
and
defend
the
constitution.
i
think
it
is
entirely
plane
from
what
i've
said
that
out
of
the
107
congressmen
in
the
reserves,
only
20
are
in
the
status
where
they
can
do
anything
to
gain
any
benefit.
very
few
of
them
do,
they
train
at
their
own
expense
and
i
don't
think
under
the
definitions
of
the
cases,
it
could
in
any
sense
be
called
an
office
onto
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
i
guess
i
would
suggest
precisely
that
the
inactive
standby
is
really
an
honorary
status
but
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
--i
would
prefer
that
--
that
of
the
--
the
retired
reservists,
50
of
them
are
without
pay,
a
very
few
of
these
congressmen
have
any
substantial
connection
with
the
military
and
such
as
it
is,
it's
purely
voluntarily
at
their
own
expense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
district
court
said
that
the
concept
of
standing
i
believe
had
been
almost
amended
in
this
circuit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
try
to
please
the
court
in
just
a
regard
if
i
can.
this
was
a
suit
brought
by
the
respondents,
the
reservists
committee
to
stop
the
war
in
several
named
members
of
the
military
reserve.
in
order
to
compel
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
secretaries
in
the
army,
navy
and
air
force,
to
remove
active
--
remove
congressmen
now
in
office
from
the
military
reserves
and
to
reclaim
paying
for
other
remedies
not
now
in
issue.
the
theory
of
the
case
is
that
the
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2,
which
the
second
half
that
clause
which
states
“no
person
holding
any
office
under
the
united
states,
shall
be
a
member
of
either
house
during
his
continuance
in
office."
clearly
the
case
is,
that
clause
places
an
obligation
upon
the
executive
branch
enforceable
by
the
courts
to
purge
from
the
reserve
ranks
all
congressmen
and
then
in
office.
the
courts
of
appeals
held
for
the
plaintiffs
the
respondents
here
in
a
summary
judgment
denying
the
government
summary
judgment
and
issue
the
declaratory
judgment
only.
the
court
--
i
am
sorry
--
the
district
court
did
that.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
opinion
except
for
one
remark
concerning
standing
which
we
will
come
to.
the
government
will
urge
reversal
hereupon
each
of
three
grounds.
we
will
urge
that
under
first
that
under
no
theory
of
standing
have
these
respondents
standing
to
maintain
this
action
either
as
taxpayers
or
as
citizens.
we
will
argue
second
that
the
question
of
whether
a
reserve
commission
is
an
office
that
disqualifies
it's
holder
from
membership
in
congress
is
an
issue
of
qualification
for
membership
of
congress
and
therefore
by
article
i,
section
5,
clause
1,
is
committed
to
the
exclusive
determination
of
the
house
in
which
the
member
sets
it
is
a
political
question
and
therefore,
nonjusticiable.
we
will
contend
finally
that
membership
in
the
reserves
particularly
of
the
type
involved
here
is
under
no
--
is
under
no
construction
of
the
word
“office”
and
“office”
within
the
meeting
of
the
constitutional
provision
employed.
we
have
discussed
standing
in
--
at
length
in
our
brief.
and
in
october,
in
the
richardson
case,
it
was
discussed
at
length,
and
i
think
it's
possible
to
fairly
brief
about
the
standing
issue
here
is
a
straightforward
one.
respondents
complained,
claim
standing
as
citizen
and
taxpayers.
and
the
injury
alleged
is
at
the
presence
of
congressmen
in
the
military
reserves
deprives
respondents
of
a
right
to
unbiased
consideration.
this
is
a
quotation
from
their
brief
“of
majors
before
the
congress
affecting
the
military
establishment
and
appropriations
therefore
and
majors
relating
to
military
action,
war
and
peace.”
the
district
court
as
i
say
denied
taxpayers
standing
but
granted
citizenship
standing.
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
cited
flast
against
cohen
and
does
seem
to
say
that
perhaps
there
was
taxpayers
standing
here
as
well
as
citizenship
standing.
i
think
it's
clear
that
there
no
standing
exist
under
either
theory.
our
brief
discusses
cases
such
as
the
students
challenge
the
regulatory
agency
procedures,
the
scrap
case
and
it's
a
--
we
discussed
at
some
length
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
extended
the
concept
of
standing
by
adding
to
the
kinds
of
injuries
that
may
be
considered.
but
so
far
as
we
know
there's
never
been
a
case
that
says,
there
need
not
be
direct
injury
specific
and
perceptible
harm
is
never
been
enough
in
this
court
were
a
plaintiff
to
alleged
an
interest
in
good
government
or
in
constitutional
principles.
and
we
think
that's
absolutely
clear
from
the
brief
and
from
frothingham
against
mellon,
the
sierra
club
case,
scrap
case,
ex
parte
levitt,
and
so
on.
a
respondent's
attempt
evade
this
body
of
law
with
the
contention
that
there
complain
alleges
very
specific
injuries
and
those
very
specific
injuries
turn
out
to
be
their
inability
to
influence
congress
which
is
not
specified,
we
don't
exactly
how
they
were
unable
to
influence
congress.
and
an
inability
they
say
to
join
with
others
in
an
effort
to
make
political
advocacy
effective.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
is
the
part
of
the
allegation
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
is
an
allegation
that
fails
because
it
is
entirely
speculative.
we
don't
know
specifically
what
measures
where
affected
by
this
attitude.
we
do
not
even
know
in
fact
that
the
attitude
exists.
respondents
assume
a
one-way
relationship
between
the
membership
and
the
reserves
and
the
political
attitude.
the
respondents
themselves
are
reserve
as
to
appear
the
whole
political
attitude
is
not
in
conformity
with
those
they
alleged
that
congressmen
hold
or
the
reserves.
the
other
point
about
that
statement
however
is
that
the
citation
in
naacp
versus
button
is
--
only
beside
the
point
because
there
is
no
allegation
here
and
either
could
we
not
with
anybody,
and
most
particularly
not
the
congress
has
taken
any
action
which
prevents
respondents
from
joining
together
to
make
their
political
advocacy
effective.
the
only
claim
is
an
attitudinal
claim,
a
claim
about
the
attitudes
of
congress
or
about
congressional
reservists.
so
that
for
these
reasons,
they
have
alleged
the
most
specific
injury,
no
specific
action.
secondly,
they
are
really
complaining
about
attitudes
that
don't
correspond
to
their
own.
and
assume
as
i
say
a
simple
one-way
relationship
but
is
not
shown
and
i
don't
think
it
could
be
shown.
and
indeed
it
occurs
to
me,
because
i
think
about
that,
that
i
don't
know
how
long
we
try
an
issue
like
that.
if
you
try
to
make
a
question
of
congressional
attitudes,
a
question
of
fact
to
show
an
injury,
you
would
have
to
try
the
issue
of
congressional
motivation
on
particular
pieces
of
legislation,
the
motivation
of
individual
congressmen
and
that's
an
issue
which
this
court
have
en
loath
to
get
into
at
least
of
fletcher
against
peck
in
1810.
finally,
i
think
it's
clear
that
respondents
are
asserting
no
more
than
the
interest
of
citizens
in
the
conduct
of
government,
and
that
is
precise
to
the
interest
to
this
case
as
this
court
has
again
begin
in
baker
against
carr
and
ex
parte
levitt
said
“it
does
not
suffice
to
confer
standing.”
i
think
the
political
nature
of
respondents
theory
of
standing
and
what
the
breads
of
that
theory
really
appears
that
in
page
ten
of
their
brief
in
which
they
discussed
the
fact
to
this
court,
by
expanding
the
concepts
of
standing
has
done
much
to
permit
grievances
of
private
citizens
against
something
describe
as
an
increasingly
all-powerful
government
to
be
litigated
in
the
courts
and
not
fought
in
the
streets.
so
i
take
it
as
a
general
right
of
petition
by
citizens
directed
to
the
court
that
is
advocated
here
for
political
grievance,
and
that
is
a
theory
of
standing
the
court
has
never
accepted.
and
i
think
should
not
accept
or
obvious
article
iii
policy
reasons.
they
do
attempt
to
analogize
their
case
to
baker
against
carr,
that
however
was
a
case
in
which
under
represented
citizens
could
prove
arithmetically
that
their
votes
were
be
valued
as
much
as
if
their
balance
have
been
burned
or
the
voting
age
have
been
raised
selectively
for
their
counties
and
we
have
already
seen
the
reasons
why
that
kind
of
perceptible,
calculable
injury
is
not
present
in
this
case.
i
should
say
about
ex
parte
levitt,
the
respondents
say,
albeit,
in
their
brief
on
page
16,
that
levitt's
only
interest
in
seeking
the
disqualification
of
mr.
justice
black
on
the
first
section
of
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2
about
senators
are
not
being
appointed
to
civil
office.
a
more
image
being
been
increased
during
the
time
he
was
a
senator.
they
say
of
that,
that
mr.
levitt's
status
was
only
that
of
a
member
of
the
bar
and
he
did
not
assert
with
justice
black's
alleged
ineligibility
could
in
any
way
deprive
him
levitt
of
unbiased
consideration
by
the
court.
the
moving
papers
on
that
case
is
a
matter
of
fact
state
only
that
mr.
levitt
was
a
member
of
this
bar
of
this
court,
however
the
court
took
it
in
the
opinion
as
both
a
citizenship
claim
and
a
member
of
the
bar
claim
and
this
allowed
standing
in
the
case.
i
think
it
would
be
instructed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
a
petition
filed
directly
in
this
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it's
a
--
it's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
wasn't
the
complaint
mr.
justice
douglas,
it
was
just
a
motion
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
was
a
motion
to
have
the
court
issue
an
order
to
show
a
cause
why
mr.
justice
black
should
not
be
disqualified
from
sitting
on
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
be
instructive
i
think
to
imagine
whether
the
result
would
have
been
any
different
in
that
petition
had
mr.
levitt
alleged
that
this
clause
was
designed
to
eliminate
bias
and
then
mr.
justice
black's
service
in
the
senate
was
likely
to
biased
in
favor
of
broad
national
powers,
a
position
which
mr.
levitt
did
not
like.
i
think
i
cannot
believe
at
that
allegation
which
would
make
this
case,
which
would
make
the
levitt
case
just
like
the
case
before
us
would
have
been
enough
to
get
mr.
levitt's
standing
in
that
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
indeed
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
in
that
sense
he
would
have
a
much
better
claim
to
standing
than
the
respondents
here
have.
but
if
you
turn
to
it
as
citizenship
standing
in
the
levitt
case
and
make
the
additional
allegation
that
i
have
supposed
that
as
a
citizen
he
was
disturbed
by
the
judicial
attitudes
of
mr.
justice
black
and
that
he
could
not
report
with,
perhaps
do
things
that
he
disapprove
of
politically
or
judicially
or
some
other
way.
i
don't
think
that
allegation
would
have
conferred
standing
in
the
levitt
case
and
yet
that
allegation
makes
the
standing
issue
there
precisely
the
same
as
it
is
in
this
case.
flast
against
cohen,
i
will
say
only
the
taxpayer
does
--
standing
here
does
not
exist
because
flast
against
cohen
lays
down
two
requirements.
the
first
is,
that
the
congressional
action
challenge
must
have
been
an
action
under
the
taxing
and
spending
clause.
and
second
is
that
the
action
must
be
in
derogation
of
a
constitutional
provision
which
was
intended
to
operate
as
a
restriction
upon
the
taxing
and
spending
power,
neither
of
those
is
true
here
obviously
because,
the
status
of
congressmen
as
reservists
is
not
congressional
action
under
the
taxing
and
spending
clause.
and
the
second
test
is
not
met
for
the
reason
that
this
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2
is
obviously
as
i
think
both
sides
in
this
case
agree,
designed
to
prevent
the
executive
domination
of
the
legislative
branch.
it
is
not
designed
to
limit
the
taxing
and
spending
power,
now
the
district
court
denied
taxing.
taxpayers
standing,
emphasizing
this
ground
and
i
would
refer
the
court,
if
i
may
to
pages
29
and
30
of
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
where
the
district
court
is
reasoning
upon
that
point
is
contained.
i
will
not
dwell
upon.
i
think
the
article
iii
reasons
why
standing
remains
the
crucial
concept
to
the
function
of
constitutional
review
or
judicial
review.
a
concept
that
requires
that
cases
come
up
in
specific
factual
context
which
are
instructive
as
to
what
general
principles
mean
and
to
prevent
to
federal
court
to
be
drawn
in
the
philosophic
debates
immediately
after
the
passage
of
legislation
before
anybody
can
show
any
direct
specific
harm
or
how
the
legislation
works.
i
would
like
instead
the
pass
if
i
may
to
the
second
of
our
arguments
which
is
that
this
claim
is
a
political
question
which
is
therefore
nonjusticiable.
as
baker
against
carr,
tells
us
a
political
question
arises
among
other
ways
when
there's
a
textually
demonstrable
commitment
of
an
issue
to
a
board
and
branch
of
government.
and
the
qualification
clause
under
article
i
section
5,
clause
1,
states
that
each
house
shall
be
the
judge
of
the
elections,
returns
and
qualifications
of
its
own
members.
the
only
question
therefore
is
whether
the
second
half
of
article
i
section
6,
clause
2,
states
a
qualification
for
membership
in
congress
that
does,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
it
is
a
nonjusticiable
issue,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
douglas.
but,
if
congress
is
the
exclusive
judge
of
this
issue
--
then
i
think
the
--
pardon
me?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
but
--
but
in
order
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
quite
correct.
it
is
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
quite
correct.
however
the
issue
of
the
qualifications
will
have
to
be
decided
by
the
court
in
order
to
order
--
to
issue
an
order
to
the
executive
branch
to
remove
these
reservists
--
these
congressmen
from
the
reserve
rules,
so
that
the
court
would
happen
necessarily
to
judge
the
issue
which
we
think
is
committed
exclusively
to
the
congress.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
by
that
you
mean,
if
he
has
been
seated
by
congress
and
still
there
the
congress,
in
that
sense,
judge
the
issue.
i
think
you
need
to
go
no
further
because
i
think
the
issue
is
solely
for
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
i
don't
think
that
would
be
different.
the
reason
i
don't
is,
that
is
seems
to
me
of
the
issue
was
exclusively
committed
to
congress
then
distinction
is
like
that
or
not
for
the
court,
they
might
be
for
congress.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
douglas
that
is
a
very
good
question.
let
me
just
--
that
--
if
he
suited
for
his
salary
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
i
would
--
i
think
i
would
say
that
probably
would
not
be
a
justiciable
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
so
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
so
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
so,
but
i
think
that
if
the
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
reached
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
the
other
way,
i
think
they
would
--
i
think
in
fairness
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
i
would
have
to
say,
should
the
court
decide
where
defense
i
would
think
it
will
not
be
a
justiciable
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
quite
right
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
a
question
however
the
test
--
the
--
the
test
limits
of
my
theory
i
must
say.
but
i
think
that
it
is
a
--
it
would
be
nonjusticiable
if
it
were
a
defense.
but
i
think
it's
easy
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
a
qualification
for
congress.
this
court
has
never
passed
upon
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
congress,
mr.
chief
justice
has
--
has
vacated
seats
and
expelled
members
upon
the
ground
that
other
kinds
of
commissions
in
the
armed
services
were
incompatible
with
the
membership
in
the
house
did
constitute
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
the
matter
is
not
close,
repeatedly
congress
has
acted
under
these
clause
to
vacate
seats
and
is
recently
is
1963,
the
senate
passed
a
resolution
which
was
acted
upon
requesting
the
senate
judiciary
committee
to
consider
the
issue
of
reserved
memberships.
i
think
the
issue
is
too
clear
actually
for
a
much
discussion,
i
think
when
i
--
the
facts
of
the
kinds
of
reserve
commissions
that
these
congressmen
hold
are
such
that,
nobody
would
conclude
that
there
were
officers
on
the
united
states.
so
that
i
think
congress'
recent
inaction
is
entirely
executable.
but
i
--i
would
like
to
reserve
the
facts
of
those
for
the
moment
to
a
demonstration
that
in
fact
this
does
did
a
qualification.
the
text
and
structure
of
this
statute,
“no
person
holding
any
office
shall
be
a
member.”
sounds
very
much
like
a
qualification
for
a
membership
in
congress
and
indeed
that
is
precisely
the
same
structure
that
the
constitution
uses
in
article
i
sections
2
and
3
when
it
states
“no
person
shall
be
a
member
of
the
house”
states
the
age
and
the
residence
requirements
and
so
forth.
in
addition
to
that,
if
you
look
at
the
two
parts
of
article
i
section
6,
clause
2,
the
first
part
says,
“no
senator
or
representative
shall
be
appointed
to
office
in
the
certain
circumstances.
the
second
half
says
“no
person
who
is
on
office
shall
be
a
senator,
a
member
of
either
house.
so,
that
obviously
the
first
part
states
a
qualification
for
office
and
the
second
part
states
a
qualification
for
a
membership
in
the
house.
and
we
know
of
the
age
and
residence
requirements
of
articles
i
sections
2
and
3
for
the
house
and
senate
are
not
the
exclusive
statements
of
qualifications
because
of
the
case
of
roudebush
v.
hartke
where
it
is
stated
that
indeed
the
17th
amendment
states
a
qualification.
i
think
the
history
of
the
adoption
of
this
claus
is
adequately
treated
in
our
brief
on
pages
34
and
35.
i
think
the
history
of
the
way
this
clause
came
into
being
demonstrates
that
it
was
intended
as
a
qualification
for
a
membership
in
the
house,
and
that
this
different
way
of
stating
the
two-halves
of
the
clause
was
intentional
and
indeed
i
would
refer
the
court
particularly
to
the
quotation
on
page
35
of
our
brief
of
number
30
--
number
52
of
the
federal
list
in
which
james
madison
listed
this
precise
part
of
article
i
section
6,
clause
2
as
a
qualification
for
a
congressmen.
beyond
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
white
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
white
i
--
i
thought
we
were
discussing
the
first-half
of
the
clause.
the
president
certainly
could
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that's
all
it
does
to
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it's
optional
with
the
executive,
should
he
decide
that
it's
bad
policy
to
have
two
offices
of
any
kind.
i
don't
think
this
is
not
as
for
two
positions
of
any
kind
combined
but
i
don't
think
is
an
already
an
obligation
to
refuse
reserve
membership
to
congressmen
i
think
both
because
i
think
this
is
not
an
option
of
states
but
more
importantly
in
the
present
context
because
it
is
a
political
question
committed
to
congressmen.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
so,
i
don't
believe
so,
oh
--
oh
you
mean
necessarily
assume.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
depends
on
which
issue
you
reach
first
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
i
could
not
honestly
answer
that,
the
affirmative
necessarily
assumed
that
to
get
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
so
to
speak.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
entirely
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
entirely
correct,
if
--
if
one
takes
that
is
an
arguendo
position
that
is
entirely
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
an
addition
in
our
brief
which
i
shall
not
re
--
recapitulate.
a
lengthy
history
of
congresses
the
treatment
of
article
i
section
6,
clause
2
as
a
--
as
a
qualification
over
which
it
has
exclusive
control,
the
earliest
case
which
is
cited
is
that
of
--
in
1803
of
representative
van
ness,
respondents
cite
that
case
to
argue
that
the
militia
commission
there
involved
was
like
a
reserve
commission
today,
i
don't
know
about
that,
i
don't
know
the
historical
record
well
enough
on
the
record
i
have
doesn't
disclose
enough
about
that
militia
commission.
be
that
as
it
may,
what
it
does
show
is
that
congress
thought
it
had
control
of
that
issue
as
a
qualification
issue
and
that
--
these
early
cases
which
on
our
brief
are
really
quite
important
because
there
are
very
close
to
the
time
of
constitutional
convention
and
the
congress
clearly
thought,
it
was
in
control
of
this
issue.
and,
i
should
stress
that
congress
also
has
thought
that
it
decides
the
meaning
of
this
clause
as
well
as
the
facts
as
in
--
we
--we
show
on
our
brief
on
page
39
that
in
1806
for
example,
the
congress
decided
that
a
government
contractor
was
not
an
officer
within
the
meaning
of
this
clause.
i
should
say
that
respondent's
brief
on
this
point
seems
to
me
to
contain
to
non
sequitur.
pages
28
and
29,
the
respondents
argue
from
the
purpose
of
the
incompatibility
clause
which
is
to
ensure
the
separation
of
the
executive
legislator
branches.
then
in
the
middle
of
page
29,
they
say
the
purpose
is
obviously
equally
well
served
and
incompatibility
eliminated
whether
the
one
office
or
the
other
is
vacated.
hence,
the
incompatibility
clause
operates
as
a
restrain
on
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative.
both
are
under
on
equal
obligations,
i
think
that
is
a
non
sequitur
of
course
if
there
is
a
--
an
incompatibility,
i
think
there
is
not,
it
would
be
cured
equally
whether
the
legislature
or
the
executive
operator
but
that
kind
of
argument
means
that
there
is
no
issue
in
the
exclusive
control
of
another
court
and
branch
of
government
because
you
can
always
say
well,
whenever
is
--
whatever
is
troublesome,
is
cured
equally
well,
if
the
court
acts
instead
of
the
congress
of
if
the
executive
acts
instead
of
the
congress.
so
the
statement
to
that,
the
incompatibility
if
it
exists
would
be
eliminated
if
the
executive
were
required
to
act
in
no
way
demonstrates
that
the
issue
in
fact
is
committed
to
the
executive
or
to
the
courts
and
the
constitution
we
think
the
fact
demonstrates
the
contrary,
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
say
just
a
word
in
conclusion
about
what
these
reserve
commissions
are,
because
i
think
they
have
been
overstated.
we
have
here,
in
the
active
standby
reserve
which
i
think
is
the
only
reserve
status
that
can
even
arguably
be
called
an
office,
20
members
of
congress
in
the
inactive
standby
reserve,
we
have
12
members
of
congress.
i
won't
mention
the
inactive
standby
reserve
again
because
the
inactive
standby
reserve
receives
nothing
and
may
not
train
even
if
he
volunteers
for
it.
it's
an
honorary
status.
then
we
have
58
members
of
congress
who
are
retired
without
pay
and
i
take
of
one,
i've
got
to
include
them
on
this.
they
are
in
107
congressmen
we're
talking
about,
but
they
certainly
is
can
hardly
be
called
an
office
to
be
retired
without
pay,
there
are
16
congressmen
retired
with
pay
of
them
six
are
retired
for
disability,
ten
for
after
period
of
service.
so
we
have
at
20
reservists
in
the
active
standby.
now,
i
think
it's
demonstrable
that
in
the
active
standby
that
is
not
only
--
not
an
office
on
united
states
but
there
is
no
executive
control
over
these
men.
and,
recall
the
hardwell
case
which
is
discussed
in
both
briefs
which
suggested
that
an
office
on
the
united
states
is
defined
by
tenure
duration,
emolument
and
duties.
none
of
these
categories
accept
the
active
standby
has
any
possibility
of
falling
within
that
definition.
an
active
standby
reserve
may
apply
for
training
but
it's
entirely
voluntary.
he's
not
called
up,
he
receives
no
pay
while
he
is
in
training.
he
receives
no
allowances,
he
pays
for
his
own
food,
he
plays
--
pays
for
his
own
uniform.
he
pays
for
his
own
travel.
the
only
expense
for
the
government
involved
as
opposed
to
going
to
the
firing
range
and
use
up
ammunition.
but
one
thing
he
can
do
is
by
training
regularly
at
his
own
expense,
is
acquire
training
points
towards
retirement.
he
gets
one
training
point
if
he
volunteers
for
this
training,
for
each
four-hour
drill
and
one
training
point
for
each
day
of
summer
activity.
and
if
he
gets
a
minimum
of
50
for
20
years,
he
then
gets
a
relatively
small
pension
at
the
age
of
60
but
that
is
the
entire
financial
connection
that
any
of
these
reservist
has
and
it's
very
small
and
very
few
congressmen
indeed
goes
to
that
training.
now,
the
respondents
i
have
cited
on
pages
40
and
41
of
their
brief
elements
of
executive
control
over
these
reservists.
i
think
i
have
shown
just
a
right
little,
but
let
me
take
them
by
category.
the
respondents
state
that
these
reservists
are
subject
to
call
by
the
president.
that
is
true,
only
with
respect
to
the
ready
reserve
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
one
congressman
in
the
ready
reserve.
he
can
be
removed
from
that
only
with
the
consent
of
a
governor
of
his
state
because
it's
a
national
guard
position,
he
is
not
involved
in
this
case
because
the
case
is
against
the
governor
or
him.
of
the
active
standby
reserve,
they
can
be
called
by
the
president
only
if
congress
declares
a
natural
--
national
emergency
or
war
under
10
united
states
code
section
6782.
so
they
are
not
a
subject
to
call
by
the
president
unless
congress
authorizes
the
call
as
the
salaries
and
expenses,
there
are
none,
there
is
a
very
small
possibility
for
some
of
them
of
a
small
pension
at
the
end
of
20
years.
if
the
respondents
say
that
they
are
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
the
only
time,
any
of
these
reserves
is
so
subject
is
when
he
is
on
--
when
he
has
voluntarily
gone
into
training
and
voluntarily
submitted
himself
to
the
code.
the
retired
reservist
is
subject
to
the
code
only
when
he
is
receiving
hospitalization.
there
is
a
mention
of
the
enlistment
term
--
enlistment
term
and
the
oath
unless
one
of
these
congressmen
is
in
the
reserve
because
he
has
a
remaining
obligation
after
having
been
drafted.
he
has
no
term
and
can
resign,
in
the
oath
he
takes
is
simply
the
one
we
all
take
to
support
and
defend
the
constitution.
i
think
it
is
entirely
plane
from
what
i've
said
that
out
of
the
107
congressmen
in
the
reserves,
only
20
are
in
the
status
where
they
can
do
anything
to
gain
any
benefit.
very
few
of
them
do,
they
train
at
their
own
expense
and
i
don't
think
under
the
definitions
of
the
cases,
it
could
in
any
sense
be
called
an
office
onto
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
i
guess
i
would
suggest
precisely
that
the
inactive
standby
is
really
an
honorary
status
but
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
--i
would
prefer
that
--
that
of
the
--
the
retired
reservists,
50
of
them
are
without
pay,
a
very
few
of
these
congressmen
have
any
substantial
connection
with
the
military
and
such
as
it
is,
it's
purely
voluntarily
at
their
own
expense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
district
court
said
that
the
concept
of
standing
i
believe
had
been
almost
amended
in
this
circuit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
the
case.
