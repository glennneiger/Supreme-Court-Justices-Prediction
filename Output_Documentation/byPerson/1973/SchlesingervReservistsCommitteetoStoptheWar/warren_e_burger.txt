chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
to
72-1188
schlesinger
against
reservists
committee.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
i'm
not
sure
just
what
considerations
impelled
us
to
enlarge
the
time
to
an
hour
and
a
half
here.
i
want
to
assure
both
counsel
that
there
will
be
no
penalty
impose
if
you
find
yourself
to
one
hour,
total
half
hour
each
or
something
near
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
that
the
theory
is
that
the
117
or
whether
number
of
members
who
hold
reserve
commissions
are
not
receptive
to
the
arguments,
political
arguments
that
they
want
to
advance,
that
they're
not
has
to
open-minded
as
congressmen
generally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
was
not
the
main
burden
of
mr.
levitt's
complaint?
was
that
one
of
the
nine
members
of
the
court
was
not
legally
here
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he's
a
member
of
the
bar
or
is
a
potential
litigant
who
he
had
a
case
here.
and
it
might
otherwise
be
equally
divided
without
the
vote
of
that
man's
member
and
then
it
could
be
quite
important
to
him
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
it
might
be
different
if
after
a
man
was
selected
to
either
house
you
were
then
confronted
with
the
situation
of
a
new
commission
emanating
from
the
executive
branch
to
the
member
of
congress
for
the
first
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there's
a
certain
element
to
speculate
a
hypothetical
element
in
that
question
as
it
was
attempted
to
be
because
--
because
that
was
the
attitude
of
the
military
establishment.
they
wouldn't
have
these
commissions
outstanding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
congress
would
still
retain
the
right
to
and
not
to
exclude
but
to
expel
a
member
of
this
ground.
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
matter
is
not
closed
when
they
are
seated
in
the
first
instance
by
any
means.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
passing
on
the
levitt
case
back
in
the
'30s
the
court
assumed
that
there
was
a
direct
violation
of
the
constitutional
provisions
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
necessarily
assumed.
you
could
say
that
it
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
as
to
the
past,
both
of
these
men
are
something
like
kentucky
colonels
in
terms
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dobrovir?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
the
bar
was
anymore
absolute
than
the
bar
that
the
court
was
dealing
with
in
the
levitt
case,
the
appointment
of
the
member
of
the
house
or
senate
who
had
voted
for
an
increase
or
in
salary
or
voted
for
the
creation
of
the
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
equally
explicit,
is
this
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
that
in
your
brief
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
arises,
does
is
not
in
connection
with
the
language
of
baker
against
carr
having
to
do
with
textually
committed
to
another
branch
by
the
language
of
the
constitution
and
that's
the
argument
of
the
government
on
one
leg
here
that
this
whole
subject
was
textually
committed
and
therefore,
it
is
a
nonjusticiable
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
mr.
levitt
had
much
of
the
same
thing
in
mind
when
he
came
here.
he
was
going
to
try
to
enforce
for
all
the
people
of
the
united
states,
the
very
explicit
provisions
in
the
fourth
part
of
that
clause
that
absolutely
precluded
the
appointment
of
a
member
of
the
senate
or
the
house
to
this
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
under
those
circumstances.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
don't
however.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
--
if
you
take
your
hypothetical
case
--
if
they
simply
say
the
court
has
no
power
even
if
the
court
says
it
has
power,
then
you
have
the
confrontation
of
what
was
discussed
to
some
extent
in
the
baker
against
carr
and
several
other
earlier
cases
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
let's
pursue
it
and
says
that
the
executive
branch
follows
it
but
congress
passes
an
act
unanimously
reinstating
the
commissions
of
these
officers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
the
type
of
confrontation
that
the
framers
talked
about
and
what
the
court's
have
talked
about
from
time
to
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
baker
against
carr,
then
it
went
into
some
specific
details
about
that,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
no
matter,
i
just
wanted
to
interrupt
your
argument
any
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
confrontation
problem
is
there
is
it
not
when
you
--
just
as
the
confrontation
problem
was
inherent
in
the
levitt
case.
in
the
levitt
case,
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
1930s
had
nominated
and
the
senate
had
confirmed
as
a
member
of
this
court,
a
person
in
--
according
to
the
allegations,
direct
violation
of
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
constitution.
so,
that
the
court
then
was
confronted
among
other
factors,
standing
in
other
questions,
it
was
confronted
with
making
a
decision
which
the
other
two
branches
had
already
passed
on,
had
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
court
said
this
is
the
kind
of
question
the
courts
can't
get
into,
won't
get
into.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
relevant
if
you
went
to
trial
on
the
merits,
this
is
highly
hypothetical
now.
if
the
members
--
117
members
of
congress
showed
that
a
99%
of
the
time
they
voted
just
the
way
your
committee
has
been
advocating
that
--
that's
a
relevant
inquiry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
if
the
member
of
congress
is
appointed
to
a
presidential
commission
that
he
suffers
the
same
bar?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dobrovir
do
you
have
further
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
of
course
a
state
function
in
--
in
the
roudebush
case
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
a
federal
matter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
--
that
function
was
just
like
counting
the
ballots
in
the
first
instance
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
also
have
to
announce
number
72-1188,
schlesinger
against
the
reservists
committee
to
stop
the
war.
this
case
also
involves
the
question
of
standing
to
bring
suit
in
the
federal
courts,
and
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
review
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justices
douglas,
brennan
and
marshall
have
filed
or
joined
in
the
dissenting
opinions
of
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
