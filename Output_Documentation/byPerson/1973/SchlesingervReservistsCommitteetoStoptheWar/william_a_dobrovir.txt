mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
this
court
today
is
the
interpretation
of
incompatibility
clause
of
the
constitution,
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2
which
prohibits
the
same
individual
from
holding
at
the
same
time
executive
branch
office
and
be
seated
in
the
congress.
and
solicitor
general
has
stated
the
three
issues
which
are
raised
before
this
court.
first
of
all,
seems
to
us
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
reserve
commission
is
an
office
which
the
clause
prohibits
a
member
of
congress
from
holding
while
he
remains
a
member.
secondly,
whether
the
plaintiffs
here
have
a
standing,
whether
we
have
proper
parties
to
raise
that
issue
and
thirdly,
even
if
the
answer
to
the
first
two
questions
is
yes,
whether
this
is
a
political
question
that
the
court
should
not
decide.
the
clause
is
older
than
our
constitution,
it
appeared
first
in
the
articles
of
confederation
and
i
believe
was
first
proposed
eight
days
after
our
nation
was
born
on
july
12,
1976
in
the
continental
congress.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
basic
--
the
basic
principle
that
a
member
of
continental
congress
should
not
hold
any
office
at
that
time
under
any
of
the
states
because
we
had
a
very
rudimentary
national
government
was
in
the
article
v,
i
believe
of
the
articles
of
confederation
and
the
clause
was
stated
in
the
articles
of
confederation
as
in
--
in
terms
that
no
member
of
the
continental
congress
shall
hold
any
office
as
to
which
there
are
salaries,
emoluments
or
other
--
article
v,
clause
2
of
the
articles
of
confederation
--
nor
shall
any
person
being
a
delegate
be
capable
of
holding
any
office
unto
the
united
states
for
which
he
or
any
other
for
his
benefit
receives
any
salary
fees
or
emoluments
of
any
kind.
the
matter
was
debated
at
a
considerable
length
during
the
constitutional
convention
and
the
debates
are
quoted
in
our
brief
and
also
with
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
i
won't
repeat
them
but
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
statements
of
mr.
elbridge
jerry,
mr.
george
mason,
madison,
hamilton,
and
others
that
the
purpose
of
the
clause
was
to
prevent
an
evil
which
was
quite
palpable
and
obvious
to
the
framers,
an
evil
that
they
saw
rise
in
the
english
parliamentary
system
under
which
the
officers
of
--
that
the
crown
by
holding
out
the
possibility
of
office
and
appointing
members
of
parliament
to
office
was
able
to
control
votes
in
the
parliament.
and
so,
they
erected
an
inflexible
and
absolute
barrier
as
they
thought,
against
any
member
of
the
legislative
branch,
the
house
of
the
senate.
having
before
him
the
possibility
as
to
dangle
--
possibly
dangle
before
in
the
words
i
think
of
george
mason
by
the
executive
of
an
office
which
might
then
influenced
his
vote,
or
influence
his
activities
in
a
manner
favored
by
an
executive.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
bar
had
a
different
purpose,
as
i
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
it's
equally
explicit
but
there
was
--
i
don't
know
if
i
can
find
the
right
word
but
i
think
there
was
more
of
an
effect,
a
desire
of
an
effect
beforehand
in
the
first
half
of
article
i,
section
6
in
which
they
were
speaking
directly
to
the
members
of
congress,
to
say,
you
shall
not
create
offices,
you
shall
not
create
or
increase
the
emoluments
of
offices
to
which
you
then
may
seek
appointment
and
this
was
something
rather
more
directly
aimed
at
preventing
any
activity
by
the
members
of
congress.
the
second
half
of
the
clause,
the
debates
made
it
quite
clear,
were
aimed
not
only
at
the
congress
but
indeed,
primarily
according
to
the
debates
at
the
executive
branch
to
prevent
the
executive
branch
from
encroaching
upon
from
influencing
the
congress.
the
bar
is
no
less
absolute
but
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
there
were
these
two
different
evils
that
they
were
aiming
at.
the
clause
had
a
curious
history
and
in
attempting
to
find
why
it
ended
up
with
the
language
that
it
presently
has,
we
found
that
as
it
came
out
of
the
committee
of
detail
on
august
6,
and
this
is
in
the
district
court's
opinion
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
page
19,
it
said,
the
members
of
each
house
shall
be
ineligible
to
and
incapable
of
holding
any
office
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
during
the
time
for
which
they
shall
respectively
be
elected
and
the
members
of
the
senate
shall
be
ineligible
to
and
capable
of
holding
any
such
office
for
one
year
afterwards.
this
was
the
incompatibility
clause
on
that
date.
it
then
came
out
of
the
committee,
it
went
into
the
committee
of
eleven
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
34
of
the
government's
brief.
the
members
of
each
house
shall
be
ineligible
to
any
civil
office
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
during
the
time
for
which
they
shall
respectively
be
elected
and
no
person
holding
any
office
under
the
united
states
shall
be
a
member
of
either
house
during
his
continuance
in
office.
in
that
form,
the
clause
stated
two
things,
it
said
no
member
shall
hold
any
office
while
he
remains
a
member
and
no
person
holding
any
office
shall
be
a
member.
in
the
committee
of
eleven,
according
to
ferrand,
that
clause
was
--
that
language
was
amended
by
the
insertion
after
the
words,
united
states
of
the
following
words
created
where
the
emoluments
whereof
--
have
been
increased
because
the
clause
as
it
stood
did
not
have
within
it
the
prohibition
that
you
--
mr.
chief
justice,
just
referred
to
against
the
one
that
was
involved
in
levitt,
against
members,
against
the
congress
creating
offices
and
then
obtaining
their
own
appointments
to
them.
and
the
way
in
which
this
was
accomplished
was
by
insertion
of
that
language.
the
rest
of
the
clause
remained
the
same.
we
cannot
speculate
because
there
is
no
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
debates
as
to
what
the
framers
had
in
mind
in
doing
this.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
by
doing
that,
they
intended
to
make
the
clause
expressly
applicable
only
to
a
member
only
to
say
that
a
person
holding
an
office
shall
not
be
a
member
which
is
the
interpretation
of
the
government
has
urged
upon
this
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
--
what
happened
to
the
clause
during
the
debates
does
not
--
it
cannot
lead
us
to
that
conclusion
and
that
the
history
of
it
and
its
final
language
does
support
our
contention
that
the
clause
is
intended
as
an
absolute
bar
against
members
holding
any
office.
this
is
in
turn
supported
by
the
later
history
of
the
clause
and
in
particular,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
1899
house
report
2205
which
is
cited
in
portions
of
which
you
quoted
in
our
brief.
but
on
50
--
page
57
of
that
report,
the
congress
refers
to
the
interpretation
of
the
provision
by
james
wilson
who
was
one
of
the
framers
--
indeed
who
is
one
of
the
framers
who
himself
argued
against
the
insertion
of
the
incompatibility
clause
in
the
constitution
and
who
also
was
one
of
the
first
members
of
this
court.
and
the
--
the
report
shows
that
in
states
--
that
in
lectures
he
delivered
in
1790
and
1791,
he
took
the
view
and
stated,
with
respect
to
this
clause
that
it
is
a
provision
by
which
the
members
of
the
legislature
will
be
precluded
while
they
remain
such
from
offices
and
then
he
said
that
this
provision
finds
with
great
propriety
--
a
place
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
in
this
important
particular,
it
has
a
decided
superiority
over
the
constitution
of
great
britain.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
provision
is
(voice
overlap)
--
that
provision
is
not
quoted
in
our
brief.
i
only
found
it
yesterday
afternoon,
your
honor.
so
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
intention
of
the
framers
was
that
members
of
congress
while
they
remain
members
of
congress
shall
not
hold
any
other
office.
there
is
a
second
principle
which
is
likewise
set
out
--
expanded
in
great
length
in
the
same
report
beginning
on
page
64
and
going
on
over
the
page
69
of
that
report
in
which
many,
many
cases
decided
by
the
state
courts
of
the
united
states
and
by
the
courts
of
great
brittain
were
cited
as
establishing
the
--
the
proposition
that
when
there
are
incompatible
offices,
when
the
same
person
is
appointed
to
an
office
which
is
incompatible
with
an
office
which
he
already
holds.
that
when
he
qualifies
and
accepts
the
second
office,
he
automatically
vacates
the
first,
that
the
proposition
as
--
as
stated
in
short
hand
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
second
office
vacates
the
first.
in
this
case,
as
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
every
member
who
is
a
reservist
was
in
the
reserves
prior
to
his
election
to
the
congress
and
the
application
of
that
principle
would
require
that
on
accepting
and
qualifying
as
a
member
of
congress,
he
should
automatically
have
vacated
his
office
as
a
member
of
the
reserves.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
as
we
read
these
--
as
we
read
these
authorities,
it
--
it
seems
to
say
automatically.
now
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
say
that
of
course,
that
did
not
occur
because
there
had
to
be
some
further
action
by
one
or
the
other
of
the
parties.
either
the
person
holding
the
commission
who
had
just
been
elected
to
congress
or
the
executive
branch
which
continued
to
maintain
him
in
that
status
in
order
--
in
order
--
in
fact
for
the
status
to
end
but
in
law,
it
would
seem
according
to
these
authorities
that
he
should
be
held
to
have
vacated
the
office.
and
all
that
remains
is
that
--
that
vacation
be
declared
by
a
body
competent
to
declare
it.
which
brings
us
to
this
--
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
--
the
clause
establishes
a
qualification
which
is
exclusively
committed
to
the
congress.
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
it
speaks
as
a
qualification
and
just
like
the
qualifications
of
age
and
inhabitancy
and
citizenship,
it
is
the
kind
of
qualification
which
this
court
in
powell
v.
mccormack
said
was
committed
only
to
the
congress
and
which
could
not
be
adjudicated
by
a
court.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
difference
in
that
--
those
qualifications
--
are
matters
--
as
we
said
in
our
brief
matters
of
--
of
pre-existing
fact
which
no
one
can
change
and
i
supposed
that
even
the
doctrine
that
these
are
matters
which
are
exclusively
committed
to
the
congress
cannot
be
absolute,
that
for
example,
if
the
congress
were
all
of
a
sudden
by
vote
to
say
that
a
senator
who
was
60
years
old
was
only
20
years
old
and
thereby
expel
him
from
the
congress,
that
one
way
or
another,
that
senator
would
have
the
right
to
have
some
court,
a
federal
court
and
ultimately
this
court
somehow
or
other
review
that
determination.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
relief
we
ask
for
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
marshall
was
a
mandamus
or
an
injunction
extended
to
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
three
service
secretaries
requiring
them
first
of
all
to
strike
from
the
roles
of
the
reserves,
any
member
of
congress
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
we
don't
think
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
we
are
not
sir.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
are
not
sir.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
don't
believe
that
this
--
that
the
qualification
matters
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no
sir,
by
no
means.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
qualification
matter
is
a
--
a
significant
issue
in
this
case
but
it
has
been
raised
and
has
been
argued
effectively
by
the
government
and
we
felt
that
we
should
respond
to
it
in
the
way
in
which
--
in
which
we
(inaudible)
i
think
your
honor's
answer
is
perhaps
the
simplest
and
the
best
answer
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
is
the
argument
--
that
it
is
a
textually
demonstrable
commitment
of
the
matter
to
a
coordinate
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
our
standing
army
--
argument
is
premised
upon
the
fact
that
this
clause
was
intended
to
prevent
this
duality
of
office
in
order
to
benefit
citizens
of
this
nation
as
a
body
politic
in
order
to
prevent
and
influence
upon
the
congress
that
the
executive
branch
might
exercise
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
any
litigant
who
comes
to
this
court,
who
comes
into
the
federal
court's
raising
a
constitutional
issue
is
going
to
seek
it
and
if
he
prevails
obtaining
enforcement
of
that
constitutional
provision,
generally
for
all
of
the
people
of
the
united
states.
what
this
court
has
said
however
is
that
a
litigant
must
himself
show
some
particularized
injury
and
i
think
that
contrary
to
the
characterization
of
the
record
made
in
the
government's
--
the
government's
papers.
we
have
showed
that
kind
of
particularized
injury
we
have
shown
as
much
injury
as
a
person
damaged
by
the
violation
of
this
clause
could
show,
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaints
that
our
attempts
to
influence
members
of
congress
in
connection
with
particular
kinds
of
issues
have
been
inhibited
because
the
--
these
members
of
congress
--
because
of
their
reserve
connection
which
we
alleged
is
absolutely
barred
by
the
constitution
--
are
biased,
biased
not
in
any
corrupt
or
fraudulent
sense
but
biased
by
reason
of
this
reserved
connection.
a
connection
which
we
though
--
which
we
submit
was
intended
by
a
prophylactic
kind
of
rule,
never
to
exist
intended
by
the
framers
never
to
exist.
those
allegations
were
made
in
our
complaint
and
there
was
never
any
answer
filed
to
the
complaint
and
therefore
under
rule
8(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
those
allegations
must
stand
admitted.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
district
court
did
not
issue
an
injunction,
the
district
court
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
your
honor.
we
did
not
appeal
it
because
the
declaratory
judgment
act
expressly
provides
that
if
the
parties
--
if
the
defendants
against
whom
a
declaratory
judgment
has
issued
do
not
comply
with
it,
the
district
court
retains
continuing
jurisdiction
and
we
could
go
back
and
ask
for
further
equitable
relief.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
have
not
because
we
don't
feel
that
it
is
yet
--
yet
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
district
court
stated
in
its
opinion
that
it
was
of
opinion
that
it
had
no
doubt
that
the
executive
branch
and
the
members
of
congress
affected
by
the
declaratory
judgment
would
be
able
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
declaration
of
the
legal
principle
and
we
have
no
doubt
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
district
court
and
--
and
affirms
the
declaration
of
the
meaning
of
the
constitutional
clause
as
stated
by
the
district
court
that
the
executive
branch
will
comply
and
that
the
members
of
congress
will
comply.
while
we
have
gotten
into
the
question
of
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
if
they
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,i
--
i
would
be
--
let
me
say
this
very
seriously
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
almost
be
the
end
of
our
constitution
if
the
executive
branch
failed
to
follow
an
order
by
a
district
--
an
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
that
kind
of
confrontation
was
the
very
thing
dealt
with
very
specifically
in
marbury
v.
madison
and
kilbourn
v.
thompson
in
this
established
principle
of
our
jurisprudence
that
if
congress
passes
an
act
which
turns
out
to
be
unconstitutional,
the
courts
declare
it
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i'm
--
i'm
afraid,
i
don't
have
in
my
mind
the
--
the
passages
and
baker
v.
carr
that
you
referred
to,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i'm
happy
to
try
to
answer
the
questions
if
perhaps
you
could
be
--
you
could
help
me.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
see
--
i
see
your
honor
's
point.
i
will
only
say
this
that
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
there
are
some
kinds
of
questions
that
courts
won't
get
into.
if
--
if
the
congress
were
to
pass
--
were
to
enact
the
statute,
putting
all
these
reserve
commissions
back
--
back
into
effect
after
the
executive
branch
had
--
had
removed
them
from
--
from
this
office.
you
would
have
an
act
of
congress
which
presumably
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
kilbourn
v.--
in
kilbourn
v.
thompson,
which
has
been
quoted
often
and
recently
by
the
court,
the
court
said
that
the
declaration
of
a
constitutional
provision
is
what
--
is
the
duty
and
--
the
province
and
the
duty
of
this
court.
and
while
i
supposed
in
those
early
days
too,
the
court
may
have
had
in
mind
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
a
direct
confrontation.
nevertheless,
the
court
had
to
do
its
duty
and
presumably,
the
congress
would
do
its
duty
and
i
don't
--
supposed
there
is
much
difference
between
an
act
of
congress
that
would
establish
--
that
would
declare
in
effect
reserve
commissions
that
had
been
--
that
had
been
declared
unlawful
and
any
other
act
of
congress
insofar
as
it
may
be
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
court
and
the
executive
prohibited
from
enforcing
it.
we
are
not
asking
for
any
relief
to
be
--
any
relief
against
the
congress
and
in
all
of
the
cases
in
which,
acts
of
congress
are
declared
un
--
unconstitutional.
no
relief
is
sought
against
the
congress,
the
relief
runs
through
the
executive
branch
which
is
thereby
prohibited
from
taking
action
or
enforcing
the
unconstitutional
act
of
congress
and
what
we
would
have
here
then
would
be
an
act
of
congress,
a
piece
of
legislation,
unconstitutional
by
the
previous
declaration
of
this
court
which
the
executive
which
would
be
prevented
from
enforcing
because
the
writs
of
this
court
do
run
to
the
executive
and
the
act
of
congress
would
sit
there
in
the
books
ineffective
like
many
other
acts
of
congress
--
like
those
other
acts
of
congress
which
have
been
declared
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
would
be
the
resolution
under
our
governmental
system
of
this
conflict.
i
would
like
to
close
with
a
--
some
discussion
of
standing.
the
principles
of
flast
v.
cohen
are
not
--
i
don't
think
a
procrustean
bed.
it
doesn't
say
if
you
are
--
you
have
18
different
items
and
if
you
have
16
of
them
--
you
have
standing
but
if
you
only
have
15
of
them
--
you
don't.
flast
v.
cohen
is
a
very
subtle
exposition
of
constitutional
principles
under
article
iii,
what
makes
a
case
a
controversy
and
secondly,
what
then
--
what
then
--
assuming
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
should
make
this
court
stay
its
hand
as
a
matter
of
self-restraint,
and
i
don't
think
we
can
talk
in
terms
of
well,
you
know,
that
was
only
a
taxpayer's
case.
the
court
was
--
the
court
was
expounding
on
what
kind
of
specific
relationship
between
the
litigant
and
two
things,
the
matter
he
was
challenging,
the
specific
action
of
the
government
that
he
was
challenging
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
constitutional
provision
that
he
was
invoking
on
the
other.
if
that
relationship
--
those
two
relationships
were
sufficiently
specific,
then
that
established
the
clear
controversy
which
gave
this
court
jurisdiction
under
article
iii
and
i
think,
without
trying
to
push
these
facts
--
the
facts
of
this
case
under
--
in
--
into
a
specific
channel,
i
think
we
can
say
that
as
citizens
who
have
--
who
have
attempted
to
petition
the
congress,
who
have
attempted
to
persuade
and
to
convince
members
of
congress,
we
have
an
interest
in
the
matter
we
are
challenging,
a
specific
interest
in
the
matter
we
are
challenging
which
is
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
reserve
officers
in
the
committee.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
don't
assume
it,
your
honor.
this
--
this
is
the
experience
that
--
that
our
members
have
had
in
--
insofar
as
they
have
exercised
their
lobbying
--
their
lobbying
function
with
respect
to
the
congress
that
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
try
to
go
beyond
of
what
is
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
don't
stop
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that's
right.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
our
concrete
allegation
is
very
simply
this
--
that
by
reason
of
their
reserve
of
their
reserve
membership,
they
have
used
--
they
are
influenced
by
the
executive
branch
because
of
this
reserve
connection
in
ways
which
would
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well
our
reserve
--
the
reserve
members
of
our
committee,
i
supposed
could
be
called
a
dissident
--
a
dissident
faction
in
the
reservist.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
supposed
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
don't
think
it's
imagining,
your
honor,
i
would
say,
this
--
that
we
would
rely
on
--
on
the
allegations
in
our
complaint
--
we
think
that
they
are
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
went
to
trial
on
the
merits
and
that
--
and
that
turned
out
to
be
the
proof
then,
we
would
loose
on
--
those
allegations
of
our
complaint
with
not
--
we
would
lose
on
that
point
and
i
suppose,
we
would
then
--
no,
we
would
not
have
a
standing
if
there
were
a
trial
on
the
merits
on
this
issue.
the
point
is
that
the
government
did
not
choose
to
challenge
these
allegations
and
there
was
no
trial
on
the
merits,
so
they
stand
uncontroverted
in
the
record.
but
i
suppose
i
should
conclude
by
just
replying
very
briefly
to
the
question
raised
by
my
brother
about
--
that
this
office
is
so
minor
and
so
tenuous
in
office
that
it
should
--
that
it
--
that
it
is
not
intended
to
be
prohibited
by
the
--
by
the
clause.
and
i
think
in
response
to
this
i
would
quote
again
from
the
18
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
is
right,
your
honor.
i
would
quote
again
from
the
1899
report
in
which
it
was
said,
“it
maybe
said
that
there
are
many
offices
under
the
united
states
of
little
importance
and
carrying
little
or
no
pay
and
that
it
cannot
be
possible
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
contemplated
forbidding
a
member
of
the
national
legislature
to
hold
one
of
these
small
offices.”
this
is
not
the
question.
no
line
could
be
drawn
between
the
large
and
the
small
office.
the
principle
declared
was
that
a
member
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
shall
not
hold
any
office
under
the
united
states
and
retain
his
seat
as
a
national
legislator.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
was
one
of
the
matters
that
was
considered
by
the
congress
in
this
very
comprehensive
1899
report
and
i
--
as
i
read
the
language,
i
think
they
at
least
felt
that
any
kind
of
office,
however
10
u.s.
if
may
be
was
barred
by
the
clause.
now,
it's
important
i
think
to
note
that
in
1899
even
though
the
report
was
very
specific
and
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes,
your
honor.
first,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
justiciability.
i
would
like
to
point
out
very
simply
that
the
question
of
a
conflict
which
i
think
is
the
prevailing,
the
principle
behind
justiciability
what
is
intended
to
be
prevented
will
not
exist
in
this
case
that
here
as
in
powell
v.
mccormack
and
i
am
referring
to
the
opinion
at
395
u.s.
at
page
548.
the
determination
of
our
claim
here
would
require
no
more
than
an
interpretation
of
the
constitution
and
this
is
falls
within
the
traditional
role
accorded
to
courts
to
interpret
the
law.
that
--
the
referral
so
to
roudebush
v.
hartke
in
which
the
court
held
--
this
court
held
that
it
did
not
violate
the
justiciability
principle
to
permit
a
court
to
order
a
recount
in
a
senatorial
election
because
to
do
so
within
no
way
impinge
upon
or
interfere
with
the
function
of
the
senate
in
later
determining
the
qualification
of
its
own
members
that
the
senate
is
free
to
accept
or
reject
the
apparent
winner.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes
it
was
but
the
court
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
court
--
the
court
indicates
very
expressly
in
footnote
23
just
mentioned
the
fact
that
this
is
a
qualification
committed
to
the
senate
and
discussed
it
in
those
terms.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
would
--
i
would
only
submit
that
--
that
nothing
this
court
does
will
interfere
with
the
power
of
the
senate
where
it
has
--
itself
to
determine
the
qualifications
of
any
of
its
members
and
there
are
political
considerations
both
ways
involved
in
what
the
congress
may
do
which
is
not
what
this
court
does
or
what
any
court
does.
and
that
this
court's
determination
will
in
no
way
either
inhibit
or
--
or
impose
any
requirement
on
the
congress
with
respect
to
the
qualification
of
a
member.
and
perhaps
there
is
indeed
wisdom
in
the
court's
deciding
questions
like
this
because
as
this
court's
said
in
--
in
brewster,
this
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
perhaps
should
not
lay
aside
its
normal
activities
and
take
on
the
responsibility
in
the
court's
words,
to
police
and
prosecute
the
myriad
activities
of
its
members.so
it
may
be
that
this
is
the
kind
of
decision
which
in
the
separation
of
powers
under
our
constitution,
the
court
should
undertake.
with
respect
to
standing
which
is
an
important
issue
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
important
that
the
injury
here
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
intent
of
the
framers.
in
the
intent
of
the
framers,
i
think
it's
clear
was
to
avoid
even
the
potential
of
any
conflict
of
interest.
even
the
potential
of
any
executive
influence
and
i
could
refer
to
--
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
dixon-yates
case
the
united
states
versus
mississippi
valley
generating
company.
in
particular
364
u.s.
at
page
549
in
which
discussing
another
conflict
of
interest
provision
that
in
a
statute,
the
court
said
that
the
statute
is
directed
not
only
at
this
honor.
but
also
a
conduct
that
tempts
dishonor
and
thus
as
in
board
of
governors
v.
agnew
which
was
cited
by
the
district
court
at
a
potential
and
that
as
the
court
continued
on
page
551
of
the
opinion
in
mississippi
valley
that
it
was
intended
by
the
congress
in
that
statute
to
establish
a
rigid
rule
of
conduct
and
i
think
that
the
incompatibility
clause
is
no
less
rigid.
with
respect
further
to
this
matter
of
injury
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
--
to
its
--
to
the
recent
decision
in
the
united
states
versus
scrap
and
to
point
out
that
there
where
users
of
the
environment,
users
of
the
parks
were
able
to
show
the
possibility
of
injury
by
way
of
the
littering
of
the
areas
that
they
use
for
recreational
purposes.
that
is
much
like
what
we
have
here
where
we
have
shown
--
we
have
shown
very
clearly
the
potential
for
harm.
the
possibility
of
littering
there,
the
potential
for
damage
to
the
--
to
our
ability
to
influence
members
of
congress
here
and
there
is
a
further
analogy
i
think
and
that
there,
the
court
found
that
those
individual
plaintiffs
were
users
of
the
specific
recreational
areas
in
question
here.
we
too
have
shown
that
we
are
in
that
sense
users
of
the
congress.
we
attempt
to
influence
the
congress.we
lobby
the
congress.
finally,
i
think
in
view
of
the
emphasis
the
court
has
put
on
ex
parte
levitt,
it
might
as
be
well
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
the
ex
parte
levitt
is
a
very
peculiar
kind
of
decision
in
that
as
--
as
the
court
has
pointed
out.
it
was
reached
on
the
basis
of
a
motion
filed
in
this
court
for
a
permission
to
file
a
petition
that
justice
black
not
be
permitted
to
take
his
seat.
and
i
went
back
and
read
the
opinion,
the
cases
that
were
cited
by
the
court.
first
of
all,
the
first
case
was
tyler
v.
judges
in
179
u.s.
405
where
the
court
there
citing
(inaudible)
on
pleadings
discussed
the
fact
that
a
party
to
have
standing
must
be
one
whose
legal
right
has
been
affected.
and
then
southern
railroad
versus
king,
that
one
i
didn't
understand
because
that
seemed
only
to
involve
the
sufficiency
of
an
answer
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
repugnance
of
a
statute
to
the
commerce
clause.
in
newman
versus
frizzell,
that
was
a
suite
in
quo
warranto
to
challenge
the
appointment
of
a
dc
commissioner
and
the
court
held
that
the
--
the
writ,
quo
warranto
was
not
available
to
someone
who
himself
did
not
claim
a
right
to
hold
the
office.
fairchild
v.--
versus
hughes
was
a
suite
to
declare
the
female
suffrage
amendment
to
the
constitution
null
and
void.
and
justice
brandeis
said
that
this
was
not
a
case
or
controversy
because
among
other
things
in
this
--
in
--in
mr.
fairchild's
own
state,
new
york,
women
had
been
granted
the
right
to
vote
so
that
the
amendment
did
not
do
him
any
greater
injury
than
he
had
already
suffered
by
the
activist's
own
legislature
and
i
think
it's
implicit
in
that
case
that
if
it
had
been
otherwise,
he
might
well
have
had
standing.
and
finally
of
course,
the
court
cited
massachusetts
v.
mellon,
and
i
won't
--
i
won't
go
into
that
any
further
i
think
what
frothingham
v.
mellon
means
today
was
very
carefully
explained
by
this
court
in
flast
v.cohen.
where
--
why
levitt
is
important
is
that
it
has
been
cited
by
this
court
in
two
or
three
recent
cases
in
particular
in
laird
versus
tatum.
and
there,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
the
context
in
which
it
was
cited,
cited
in
the
context
of
a
situation
where
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
that
particular
case,
themselves
had
admitted
that
they
had
not
been
injured
that
they
had
suffered
no
inhibition
of
their
own
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights
on
the
basis
--
on
the
basis
of
the
surveillance
that
have
been
visited
upon
them.
and
so,
i
--i
would
submit
that
ex-parte
levitt
does
not,
this
very
brief
and
per
curiam
opinion
on
a
motion
by
mr.
levitt
as
a
--
as
a
member
of
the
bar
should
not
--
should
not
be
adopted
by
this
court
as
a
limiting
principle
and
as
--
as
--
and
the
taking
away
from
what
this
court
has
--
has
granted
in
effect
in
flast
v.
cohen.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
this
court
today
is
the
interpretation
of
incompatibility
clause
of
the
constitution,
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2
which
prohibits
the
same
individual
from
holding
at
the
same
time
executive
branch
office
and
be
seated
in
the
congress.
and
solicitor
general
has
stated
the
three
issues
which
are
raised
before
this
court.
first
of
all,
seems
to
us
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
reserve
commission
is
an
office
which
the
clause
prohibits
a
member
of
congress
from
holding
while
he
remains
a
member.
secondly,
whether
the
plaintiffs
here
have
a
standing,
whether
we
have
proper
parties
to
raise
that
issue
and
thirdly,
even
if
the
answer
to
the
first
two
questions
is
yes,
whether
this
is
a
political
question
that
the
court
should
not
decide.
the
clause
is
older
than
our
constitution,
it
appeared
first
in
the
articles
of
confederation
and
i
believe
was
first
proposed
eight
days
after
our
nation
was
born
on
july
12,
1976
in
the
continental
congress.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
basic
--
the
basic
principle
that
a
member
of
continental
congress
should
not
hold
any
office
at
that
time
under
any
of
the
states
because
we
had
a
very
rudimentary
national
government
was
in
the
article
v,
i
believe
of
the
articles
of
confederation
and
the
clause
was
stated
in
the
articles
of
confederation
as
in
--
in
terms
that
no
member
of
the
continental
congress
shall
hold
any
office
as
to
which
there
are
salaries,
emoluments
or
other
--
article
v,
clause
2
of
the
articles
of
confederation
--
nor
shall
any
person
being
a
delegate
be
capable
of
holding
any
office
unto
the
united
states
for
which
he
or
any
other
for
his
benefit
receives
any
salary
fees
or
emoluments
of
any
kind.
the
matter
was
debated
at
a
considerable
length
during
the
constitutional
convention
and
the
debates
are
quoted
in
our
brief
and
also
with
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
i
won't
repeat
them
but
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
statements
of
mr.
elbridge
jerry,
mr.
george
mason,
madison,
hamilton,
and
others
that
the
purpose
of
the
clause
was
to
prevent
an
evil
which
was
quite
palpable
and
obvious
to
the
framers,
an
evil
that
they
saw
rise
in
the
english
parliamentary
system
under
which
the
officers
of
--
that
the
crown
by
holding
out
the
possibility
of
office
and
appointing
members
of
parliament
to
office
was
able
to
control
votes
in
the
parliament.
and
so,
they
erected
an
inflexible
and
absolute
barrier
as
they
thought,
against
any
member
of
the
legislative
branch,
the
house
of
the
senate.
having
before
him
the
possibility
as
to
dangle
--
possibly
dangle
before
in
the
words
i
think
of
george
mason
by
the
executive
of
an
office
which
might
then
influenced
his
vote,
or
influence
his
activities
in
a
manner
favored
by
an
executive.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
bar
had
a
different
purpose,
as
i
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
it's
equally
explicit
but
there
was
--
i
don't
know
if
i
can
find
the
right
word
but
i
think
there
was
more
of
an
effect,
a
desire
of
an
effect
beforehand
in
the
first
half
of
article
i,
section
6
in
which
they
were
speaking
directly
to
the
members
of
congress,
to
say,
you
shall
not
create
offices,
you
shall
not
create
or
increase
the
emoluments
of
offices
to
which
you
then
may
seek
appointment
and
this
was
something
rather
more
directly
aimed
at
preventing
any
activity
by
the
members
of
congress.
the
second
half
of
the
clause,
the
debates
made
it
quite
clear,
were
aimed
not
only
at
the
congress
but
indeed,
primarily
according
to
the
debates
at
the
executive
branch
to
prevent
the
executive
branch
from
encroaching
upon
from
influencing
the
congress.
the
bar
is
no
less
absolute
but
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
there
were
these
two
different
evils
that
they
were
aiming
at.
the
clause
had
a
curious
history
and
in
attempting
to
find
why
it
ended
up
with
the
language
that
it
presently
has,
we
found
that
as
it
came
out
of
the
committee
of
detail
on
august
6,
and
this
is
in
the
district
court's
opinion
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
page
19,
it
said,
the
members
of
each
house
shall
be
ineligible
to
and
incapable
of
holding
any
office
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
during
the
time
for
which
they
shall
respectively
be
elected
and
the
members
of
the
senate
shall
be
ineligible
to
and
capable
of
holding
any
such
office
for
one
year
afterwards.
this
was
the
incompatibility
clause
on
that
date.
it
then
came
out
of
the
committee,
it
went
into
the
committee
of
eleven
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
34
of
the
government's
brief.
the
members
of
each
house
shall
be
ineligible
to
any
civil
office
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
during
the
time
for
which
they
shall
respectively
be
elected
and
no
person
holding
any
office
under
the
united
states
shall
be
a
member
of
either
house
during
his
continuance
in
office.
in
that
form,
the
clause
stated
two
things,
it
said
no
member
shall
hold
any
office
while
he
remains
a
member
and
no
person
holding
any
office
shall
be
a
member.
in
the
committee
of
eleven,
according
to
ferrand,
that
clause
was
--
that
language
was
amended
by
the
insertion
after
the
words,
united
states
of
the
following
words
created
where
the
emoluments
whereof
--
have
been
increased
because
the
clause
as
it
stood
did
not
have
within
it
the
prohibition
that
you
--
mr.
chief
justice,
just
referred
to
against
the
one
that
was
involved
in
levitt,
against
members,
against
the
congress
creating
offices
and
then
obtaining
their
own
appointments
to
them.
and
the
way
in
which
this
was
accomplished
was
by
insertion
of
that
language.
the
rest
of
the
clause
remained
the
same.
we
cannot
speculate
because
there
is
no
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
debates
as
to
what
the
framers
had
in
mind
in
doing
this.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
by
doing
that,
they
intended
to
make
the
clause
expressly
applicable
only
to
a
member
only
to
say
that
a
person
holding
an
office
shall
not
be
a
member
which
is
the
interpretation
of
the
government
has
urged
upon
this
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
--
what
happened
to
the
clause
during
the
debates
does
not
--
it
cannot
lead
us
to
that
conclusion
and
that
the
history
of
it
and
its
final
language
does
support
our
contention
that
the
clause
is
intended
as
an
absolute
bar
against
members
holding
any
office.
this
is
in
turn
supported
by
the
later
history
of
the
clause
and
in
particular,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
1899
house
report
2205
which
is
cited
in
portions
of
which
you
quoted
in
our
brief.
but
on
50
--
page
57
of
that
report,
the
congress
refers
to
the
interpretation
of
the
provision
by
james
wilson
who
was
one
of
the
framers
--
indeed
who
is
one
of
the
framers
who
himself
argued
against
the
insertion
of
the
incompatibility
clause
in
the
constitution
and
who
also
was
one
of
the
first
members
of
this
court.
and
the
--
the
report
shows
that
in
states
--
that
in
lectures
he
delivered
in
1790
and
1791,
he
took
the
view
and
stated,
with
respect
to
this
clause
that
it
is
a
provision
by
which
the
members
of
the
legislature
will
be
precluded
while
they
remain
such
from
offices
and
then
he
said
that
this
provision
finds
with
great
propriety
--
a
place
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
in
this
important
particular,
it
has
a
decided
superiority
over
the
constitution
of
great
britain.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
provision
is
(voice
overlap)
--
that
provision
is
not
quoted
in
our
brief.
i
only
found
it
yesterday
afternoon,
your
honor.
so
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
intention
of
the
framers
was
that
members
of
congress
while
they
remain
members
of
congress
shall
not
hold
any
other
office.
there
is
a
second
principle
which
is
likewise
set
out
--
expanded
in
great
length
in
the
same
report
beginning
on
page
64
and
going
on
over
the
page
69
of
that
report
in
which
many,
many
cases
decided
by
the
state
courts
of
the
united
states
and
by
the
courts
of
great
brittain
were
cited
as
establishing
the
--
the
proposition
that
when
there
are
incompatible
offices,
when
the
same
person
is
appointed
to
an
office
which
is
incompatible
with
an
office
which
he
already
holds.
that
when
he
qualifies
and
accepts
the
second
office,
he
automatically
vacates
the
first,
that
the
proposition
as
--
as
stated
in
short
hand
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
second
office
vacates
the
first.
in
this
case,
as
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
every
member
who
is
a
reservist
was
in
the
reserves
prior
to
his
election
to
the
congress
and
the
application
of
that
principle
would
require
that
on
accepting
and
qualifying
as
a
member
of
congress,
he
should
automatically
have
vacated
his
office
as
a
member
of
the
reserves.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
as
we
read
these
--
as
we
read
these
authorities,
it
--
it
seems
to
say
automatically.
now
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
say
that
of
course,
that
did
not
occur
because
there
had
to
be
some
further
action
by
one
or
the
other
of
the
parties.
either
the
person
holding
the
commission
who
had
just
been
elected
to
congress
or
the
executive
branch
which
continued
to
maintain
him
in
that
status
in
order
--
in
order
--
in
fact
for
the
status
to
end
but
in
law,
it
would
seem
according
to
these
authorities
that
he
should
be
held
to
have
vacated
the
office.
and
all
that
remains
is
that
--
that
vacation
be
declared
by
a
body
competent
to
declare
it.
which
brings
us
to
this
--
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
--
the
clause
establishes
a
qualification
which
is
exclusively
committed
to
the
congress.
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
it
speaks
as
a
qualification
and
just
like
the
qualifications
of
age
and
inhabitancy
and
citizenship,
it
is
the
kind
of
qualification
which
this
court
in
powell
v.
mccormack
said
was
committed
only
to
the
congress
and
which
could
not
be
adjudicated
by
a
court.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
difference
in
that
--
those
qualifications
--
are
matters
--
as
we
said
in
our
brief
matters
of
--
of
pre-existing
fact
which
no
one
can
change
and
i
supposed
that
even
the
doctrine
that
these
are
matters
which
are
exclusively
committed
to
the
congress
cannot
be
absolute,
that
for
example,
if
the
congress
were
all
of
a
sudden
by
vote
to
say
that
a
senator
who
was
60
years
old
was
only
20
years
old
and
thereby
expel
him
from
the
congress,
that
one
way
or
another,
that
senator
would
have
the
right
to
have
some
court,
a
federal
court
and
ultimately
this
court
somehow
or
other
review
that
determination.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
relief
we
ask
for
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
marshall
was
a
mandamus
or
an
injunction
extended
to
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
three
service
secretaries
requiring
them
first
of
all
to
strike
from
the
roles
of
the
reserves,
any
member
of
congress
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
we
don't
think
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
we
are
not
sir.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
are
not
sir.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
don't
believe
that
this
--
that
the
qualification
matters
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no
sir,
by
no
means.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
qualification
matter
is
a
--
a
significant
issue
in
this
case
but
it
has
been
raised
and
has
been
argued
effectively
by
the
government
and
we
felt
that
we
should
respond
to
it
in
the
way
in
which
--
in
which
we
(inaudible)
i
think
your
honor's
answer
is
perhaps
the
simplest
and
the
best
answer
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
is
the
argument
--
that
it
is
a
textually
demonstrable
commitment
of
the
matter
to
a
coordinate
branch
of
the
government.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
our
standing
army
--
argument
is
premised
upon
the
fact
that
this
clause
was
intended
to
prevent
this
duality
of
office
in
order
to
benefit
citizens
of
this
nation
as
a
body
politic
in
order
to
prevent
and
influence
upon
the
congress
that
the
executive
branch
might
exercise
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
any
litigant
who
comes
to
this
court,
who
comes
into
the
federal
court's
raising
a
constitutional
issue
is
going
to
seek
it
and
if
he
prevails
obtaining
enforcement
of
that
constitutional
provision,
generally
for
all
of
the
people
of
the
united
states.
what
this
court
has
said
however
is
that
a
litigant
must
himself
show
some
particularized
injury
and
i
think
that
contrary
to
the
characterization
of
the
record
made
in
the
government's
--
the
government's
papers.
we
have
showed
that
kind
of
particularized
injury
we
have
shown
as
much
injury
as
a
person
damaged
by
the
violation
of
this
clause
could
show,
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaints
that
our
attempts
to
influence
members
of
congress
in
connection
with
particular
kinds
of
issues
have
been
inhibited
because
the
--
these
members
of
congress
--
because
of
their
reserve
connection
which
we
alleged
is
absolutely
barred
by
the
constitution
--
are
biased,
biased
not
in
any
corrupt
or
fraudulent
sense
but
biased
by
reason
of
this
reserved
connection.
a
connection
which
we
though
--
which
we
submit
was
intended
by
a
prophylactic
kind
of
rule,
never
to
exist
intended
by
the
framers
never
to
exist.
those
allegations
were
made
in
our
complaint
and
there
was
never
any
answer
filed
to
the
complaint
and
therefore
under
rule
8(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
those
allegations
must
stand
admitted.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
district
court
did
not
issue
an
injunction,
the
district
court
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
your
honor.
we
did
not
appeal
it
because
the
declaratory
judgment
act
expressly
provides
that
if
the
parties
--
if
the
defendants
against
whom
a
declaratory
judgment
has
issued
do
not
comply
with
it,
the
district
court
retains
continuing
jurisdiction
and
we
could
go
back
and
ask
for
further
equitable
relief.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
have
not
because
we
don't
feel
that
it
is
yet
--
yet
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
district
court
stated
in
its
opinion
that
it
was
of
opinion
that
it
had
no
doubt
that
the
executive
branch
and
the
members
of
congress
affected
by
the
declaratory
judgment
would
be
able
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
declaration
of
the
legal
principle
and
we
have
no
doubt
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
district
court
and
--
and
affirms
the
declaration
of
the
meaning
of
the
constitutional
clause
as
stated
by
the
district
court
that
the
executive
branch
will
comply
and
that
the
members
of
congress
will
comply.
while
we
have
gotten
into
the
question
of
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
if
they
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,i
--
i
would
be
--
let
me
say
this
very
seriously
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
almost
be
the
end
of
our
constitution
if
the
executive
branch
failed
to
follow
an
order
by
a
district
--
an
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
that
kind
of
confrontation
was
the
very
thing
dealt
with
very
specifically
in
marbury
v.
madison
and
kilbourn
v.
thompson
in
this
established
principle
of
our
jurisprudence
that
if
congress
passes
an
act
which
turns
out
to
be
unconstitutional,
the
courts
declare
it
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i'm
--
i'm
afraid,
i
don't
have
in
my
mind
the
--
the
passages
and
baker
v.
carr
that
you
referred
to,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i'm
happy
to
try
to
answer
the
questions
if
perhaps
you
could
be
--
you
could
help
me.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
see
--
i
see
your
honor
's
point.
i
will
only
say
this
that
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
there
are
some
kinds
of
questions
that
courts
won't
get
into.
if
--
if
the
congress
were
to
pass
--
were
to
enact
the
statute,
putting
all
these
reserve
commissions
back
--
back
into
effect
after
the
executive
branch
had
--
had
removed
them
from
--
from
this
office.
you
would
have
an
act
of
congress
which
presumably
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
kilbourn
v.--
in
kilbourn
v.
thompson,
which
has
been
quoted
often
and
recently
by
the
court,
the
court
said
that
the
declaration
of
a
constitutional
provision
is
what
--
is
the
duty
and
--
the
province
and
the
duty
of
this
court.
and
while
i
supposed
in
those
early
days
too,
the
court
may
have
had
in
mind
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
a
direct
confrontation.
nevertheless,
the
court
had
to
do
its
duty
and
presumably,
the
congress
would
do
its
duty
and
i
don't
--
supposed
there
is
much
difference
between
an
act
of
congress
that
would
establish
--
that
would
declare
in
effect
reserve
commissions
that
had
been
--
that
had
been
declared
unlawful
and
any
other
act
of
congress
insofar
as
it
may
be
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
court
and
the
executive
prohibited
from
enforcing
it.
we
are
not
asking
for
any
relief
to
be
--
any
relief
against
the
congress
and
in
all
of
the
cases
in
which,
acts
of
congress
are
declared
un
--
unconstitutional.
no
relief
is
sought
against
the
congress,
the
relief
runs
through
the
executive
branch
which
is
thereby
prohibited
from
taking
action
or
enforcing
the
unconstitutional
act
of
congress
and
what
we
would
have
here
then
would
be
an
act
of
congress,
a
piece
of
legislation,
unconstitutional
by
the
previous
declaration
of
this
court
which
the
executive
which
would
be
prevented
from
enforcing
because
the
writs
of
this
court
do
run
to
the
executive
and
the
act
of
congress
would
sit
there
in
the
books
ineffective
like
many
other
acts
of
congress
--
like
those
other
acts
of
congress
which
have
been
declared
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
would
be
the
resolution
under
our
governmental
system
of
this
conflict.
i
would
like
to
close
with
a
--
some
discussion
of
standing.
the
principles
of
flast
v.
cohen
are
not
--
i
don't
think
a
procrustean
bed.
it
doesn't
say
if
you
are
--
you
have
18
different
items
and
if
you
have
16
of
them
--
you
have
standing
but
if
you
only
have
15
of
them
--
you
don't.
flast
v.
cohen
is
a
very
subtle
exposition
of
constitutional
principles
under
article
iii,
what
makes
a
case
a
controversy
and
secondly,
what
then
--
what
then
--
assuming
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
should
make
this
court
stay
its
hand
as
a
matter
of
self-restraint,
and
i
don't
think
we
can
talk
in
terms
of
well,
you
know,
that
was
only
a
taxpayer's
case.
the
court
was
--
the
court
was
expounding
on
what
kind
of
specific
relationship
between
the
litigant
and
two
things,
the
matter
he
was
challenging,
the
specific
action
of
the
government
that
he
was
challenging
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
constitutional
provision
that
he
was
invoking
on
the
other.
if
that
relationship
--
those
two
relationships
were
sufficiently
specific,
then
that
established
the
clear
controversy
which
gave
this
court
jurisdiction
under
article
iii
and
i
think,
without
trying
to
push
these
facts
--
the
facts
of
this
case
under
--
in
--
into
a
specific
channel,
i
think
we
can
say
that
as
citizens
who
have
--
who
have
attempted
to
petition
the
congress,
who
have
attempted
to
persuade
and
to
convince
members
of
congress,
we
have
an
interest
in
the
matter
we
are
challenging,
a
specific
interest
in
the
matter
we
are
challenging
which
is
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
reserve
officers
in
the
committee.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
don't
assume
it,
your
honor.
this
--
this
is
the
experience
that
--
that
our
members
have
had
in
--
insofar
as
they
have
exercised
their
lobbying
--
their
lobbying
function
with
respect
to
the
congress
that
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
try
to
go
beyond
of
what
is
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
don't
stop
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that's
right.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
our
concrete
allegation
is
very
simply
this
--
that
by
reason
of
their
reserve
of
their
reserve
membership,
they
have
used
--
they
are
influenced
by
the
executive
branch
because
of
this
reserve
connection
in
ways
which
would
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well
our
reserve
--
the
reserve
members
of
our
committee,
i
supposed
could
be
called
a
dissident
--
a
dissident
faction
in
the
reservist.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
supposed
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
i
don't
think
it's
imagining,
your
honor,
i
would
say,
this
--
that
we
would
rely
on
--
on
the
allegations
in
our
complaint
--
we
think
that
they
are
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
we
went
to
trial
on
the
merits
and
that
--
and
that
turned
out
to
be
the
proof
then,
we
would
loose
on
--
those
allegations
of
our
complaint
with
not
--
we
would
lose
on
that
point
and
i
suppose,
we
would
then
--
no,
we
would
not
have
a
standing
if
there
were
a
trial
on
the
merits
on
this
issue.
the
point
is
that
the
government
did
not
choose
to
challenge
these
allegations
and
there
was
no
trial
on
the
merits,
so
they
stand
uncontroverted
in
the
record.
but
i
suppose
i
should
conclude
by
just
replying
very
briefly
to
the
question
raised
by
my
brother
about
--
that
this
office
is
so
minor
and
so
tenuous
in
office
that
it
should
--
that
it
--
that
it
is
not
intended
to
be
prohibited
by
the
--
by
the
clause.
and
i
think
in
response
to
this
i
would
quote
again
from
the
18
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
is
right,
your
honor.
i
would
quote
again
from
the
1899
report
in
which
it
was
said,
“it
maybe
said
that
there
are
many
offices
under
the
united
states
of
little
importance
and
carrying
little
or
no
pay
and
that
it
cannot
be
possible
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
contemplated
forbidding
a
member
of
the
national
legislature
to
hold
one
of
these
small
offices.”
this
is
not
the
question.
no
line
could
be
drawn
between
the
large
and
the
small
office.
the
principle
declared
was
that
a
member
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
shall
not
hold
any
office
under
the
united
states
and
retain
his
seat
as
a
national
legislator.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
was
one
of
the
matters
that
was
considered
by
the
congress
in
this
very
comprehensive
1899
report
and
i
--
as
i
read
the
language,
i
think
they
at
least
felt
that
any
kind
of
office,
however
10
u.s.
if
may
be
was
barred
by
the
clause.
now,
it's
important
i
think
to
note
that
in
1899
even
though
the
report
was
very
specific
and
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes,
your
honor.
first,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
justiciability.
i
would
like
to
point
out
very
simply
that
the
question
of
a
conflict
which
i
think
is
the
prevailing,
the
principle
behind
justiciability
what
is
intended
to
be
prevented
will
not
exist
in
this
case
that
here
as
in
powell
v.
mccormack
and
i
am
referring
to
the
opinion
at
395
u.s.
at
page
548.
the
determination
of
our
claim
here
would
require
no
more
than
an
interpretation
of
the
constitution
and
this
is
falls
within
the
traditional
role
accorded
to
courts
to
interpret
the
law.
that
--
the
referral
so
to
roudebush
v.
hartke
in
which
the
court
held
--
this
court
held
that
it
did
not
violate
the
justiciability
principle
to
permit
a
court
to
order
a
recount
in
a
senatorial
election
because
to
do
so
within
no
way
impinge
upon
or
interfere
with
the
function
of
the
senate
in
later
determining
the
qualification
of
its
own
members
that
the
senate
is
free
to
accept
or
reject
the
apparent
winner.
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
yes
it
was
but
the
court
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
the
court
--
the
court
indicates
very
expressly
in
footnote
23
just
mentioned
the
fact
that
this
is
a
qualification
committed
to
the
senate
and
discussed
it
in
those
terms.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
well,
i
would
--
i
would
only
submit
that
--
that
nothing
this
court
does
will
interfere
with
the
power
of
the
senate
where
it
has
--
itself
to
determine
the
qualifications
of
any
of
its
members
and
there
are
political
considerations
both
ways
involved
in
what
the
congress
may
do
which
is
not
what
this
court
does
or
what
any
court
does.
and
that
this
court's
determination
will
in
no
way
either
inhibit
or
--
or
impose
any
requirement
on
the
congress
with
respect
to
the
qualification
of
a
member.
and
perhaps
there
is
indeed
wisdom
in
the
court's
deciding
questions
like
this
because
as
this
court's
said
in
--
in
brewster,
this
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
perhaps
should
not
lay
aside
its
normal
activities
and
take
on
the
responsibility
in
the
court's
words,
to
police
and
prosecute
the
myriad
activities
of
its
members.so
it
may
be
that
this
is
the
kind
of
decision
which
in
the
separation
of
powers
under
our
constitution,
the
court
should
undertake.
with
respect
to
standing
which
is
an
important
issue
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
important
that
the
injury
here
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
intent
of
the
framers.
in
the
intent
of
the
framers,
i
think
it's
clear
was
to
avoid
even
the
potential
of
any
conflict
of
interest.
even
the
potential
of
any
executive
influence
and
i
could
refer
to
--
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
dixon-yates
case
the
united
states
versus
mississippi
valley
generating
company.
in
particular
364
u.s.
at
page
549
in
which
discussing
another
conflict
of
interest
provision
that
in
a
statute,
the
court
said
that
the
statute
is
directed
not
only
at
this
honor.
but
also
a
conduct
that
tempts
dishonor
and
thus
as
in
board
of
governors
v.
agnew
which
was
cited
by
the
district
court
at
a
potential
and
that
as
the
court
continued
on
page
551
of
the
opinion
in
mississippi
valley
that
it
was
intended
by
the
congress
in
that
statute
to
establish
a
rigid
rule
of
conduct
and
i
think
that
the
incompatibility
clause
is
no
less
rigid.
with
respect
further
to
this
matter
of
injury
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
--
to
its
--
to
the
recent
decision
in
the
united
states
versus
scrap
and
to
point
out
that
there
where
users
of
the
environment,
users
of
the
parks
were
able
to
show
the
possibility
of
injury
by
way
of
the
littering
of
the
areas
that
they
use
for
recreational
purposes.
that
is
much
like
what
we
have
here
where
we
have
shown
--
we
have
shown
very
clearly
the
potential
for
harm.
the
possibility
of
littering
there,
the
potential
for
damage
to
the
--
to
our
ability
to
influence
members
of
congress
here
and
there
is
a
further
analogy
i
think
and
that
there,
the
court
found
that
those
individual
plaintiffs
were
users
of
the
specific
recreational
areas
in
question
here.
we
too
have
shown
that
we
are
in
that
sense
users
of
the
congress.
we
attempt
to
influence
the
congress.we
lobby
the
congress.
finally,
i
think
in
view
of
the
emphasis
the
court
has
put
on
ex
parte
levitt,
it
might
as
be
well
--
mr.
william
a.
dobrovir
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
the
ex
parte
levitt
is
a
very
peculiar
kind
of
decision
in
that
as
--
as
the
court
has
pointed
out.
it
was
reached
on
the
basis
of
a
motion
filed
in
this
court
for
a
permission
to
file
a
petition
that
justice
black
not
be
permitted
to
take
his
seat.
and
i
went
back
and
read
the
opinion,
the
cases
that
were
cited
by
the
court.
first
of
all,
the
first
case
was
tyler
v.
judges
in
179
u.s.
405
where
the
court
there
citing
(inaudible)
on
pleadings
discussed
the
fact
that
a
party
to
have
standing
must
be
one
whose
legal
right
has
been
affected.
and
then
southern
railroad
versus
king,
that
one
i
didn't
understand
because
that
seemed
only
to
involve
the
sufficiency
of
an
answer
to
raise
the
issue
of
the
repugnance
of
a
statute
to
the
commerce
clause.
in
newman
versus
frizzell,
that
was
a
suite
in
quo
warranto
to
challenge
the
appointment
of
a
dc
commissioner
and
the
court
held
that
the
--
the
writ,
quo
warranto
was
not
available
to
someone
who
himself
did
not
claim
a
right
to
hold
the
office.
fairchild
v.--
versus
hughes
was
a
suite
to
declare
the
female
suffrage
amendment
to
the
constitution
null
and
void.
and
justice
brandeis
said
that
this
was
not
a
case
or
controversy
because
among
other
things
in
this
--
in
--in
mr.
fairchild's
own
state,
new
york,
women
had
been
granted
the
right
to
vote
so
that
the
amendment
did
not
do
him
any
greater
injury
than
he
had
already
suffered
by
the
activist's
own
legislature
and
i
think
it's
implicit
in
that
case
that
if
it
had
been
otherwise,
he
might
well
have
had
standing.
and
finally
of
course,
the
court
cited
massachusetts
v.
mellon,
and
i
won't
--
i
won't
go
into
that
any
further
i
think
what
frothingham
v.
mellon
means
today
was
very
carefully
explained
by
this
court
in
flast
v.cohen.
where
--
why
levitt
is
important
is
that
it
has
been
cited
by
this
court
in
two
or
three
recent
cases
in
particular
in
laird
versus
tatum.
and
there,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
the
context
in
which
it
was
cited,
cited
in
the
context
of
a
situation
where
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
that
particular
case,
themselves
had
admitted
that
