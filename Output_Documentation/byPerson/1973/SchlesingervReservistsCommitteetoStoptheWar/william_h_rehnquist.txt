justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
at
least
preferred
to
the
courts
of
opinion
there,
the
court
would
have
ruled
the
same
way
even
if
it
satisfied
itself
that
there
have
been
a
direct
violation
of
the
constitution
--
that
it
affected
in
no
way
it's
determination
to
standing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words
the
remedy
--
the
remedy
there
is
that
the
president
in
1937,
the
court
was
saying
you
should
apply
the
--
should
not
--
have
nominated
and
the
senate
should
not
have
not
confirmed
but
having
done
so
the
court
wasn't
going
to
get
into
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
standing
argument
is
--
is
dependent
to
a
certain
extent,
isn't
it?
on
the
question
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
you
about,
about
the
fact
these
people
are
congressmen.
i
--
i
doubt
that
you
would
claim
standing
to
going
to
the
district
court
and
say
mr.
x
who
is
not
a
member
of
congress
really
shouldn't
be
on
the
reserve
roles
because
he's
got
bad
eyesight.
you
--
you're
standing
argument
is
dependent
on
the
fact
that
these
people
are
not
only
disqualified
from
the
reserve
but
that
they
are
congressmen.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
--
which
are
normal
--
say
as
the
garden

reserve
requirement
that
the
guy
have
corrected
20-20
vision
wouldn't
be
anything
like.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
you
--
you're
standing
according
depends
partly
on
the
fact

you're
a

whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
