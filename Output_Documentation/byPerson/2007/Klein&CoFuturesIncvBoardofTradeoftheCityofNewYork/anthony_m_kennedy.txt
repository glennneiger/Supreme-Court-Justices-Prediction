anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose,
to
narrow
that
hypothetical,
that
there's
a
rule
that
you
can't
be
an
employee
of
the
clearinghouse
or
the
exchange
if
you
have
a
conviction
for
fraud,
and
they
don't...
they're
negligent
and
careless
about
enforcing
that
rule
and
that
fraud
causes
the
loss.
under
either
your
theory
or
the
government's
theory,
would
there
be
liability,
and
is
there
a
difference
between
those
two
theories?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
my
hypothetical
there
is
a
transaction
and
there
are
actual
damages...
i'm
reading
from...
from
(b)(c).
there's
been
a
transaction
and
the
liabilities
for
damages
sustained
by
a
person
who
engaged
in
the
transaction
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
buyer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
under
that
reading
they
should
have
used
the
word
"and"
rather
than
"or".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
which
is
subject
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the...
the
buy
and
the
sell
contract
will
be
worth
nothing
if
it
isn't
cleared.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know.
but
you
want...
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
clearing
is
no
part
of
the
transaction,
but
the
clearing
is
necessary
to
make
a
transaction
go
forward.
otherwise
the
contract
is
just
a
nullity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
that
subject
and
you...
your
client
obviously
has
an
institutional
interest
in
the
case,
assuming
you
don't
prevail,
is
the
government's
theory
much
broader
and
more
undesirable
in
your
view
than
that
offered
in
klein
brief?
i
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
ask
mr.
days
if
he
accepted
the
government's
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
instances
where
multiple
parties
who
are
injured
sue
under
state
law,
or
is
this
generally
deemed
preemptive,
or
it
just
doesn't
happen,
or--
