justice
david
h.
souter
i
think--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is...
i
don't
want
to
reduce
the
issue
down
to
something
too
simplistic,
but
is
there
a
rule
that
says
don't
lie,
don't
commit
fraud?
justice
david
h.
souter
am
i...
am
i
right
that
we
really
do
not
have
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--am
i
correct
that
we
really
do
not
have
to
determine
that
issue
this
morning?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
we
have
to
determine
is
whether
it
is
possible
for
the
petitioner
here
to
be
within
the
class
of
those
with
standing?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stewart--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
stewart,
may
i
go
back
to
the
question
of
multiple
recoveries.
and
by
that
term,
as
i
understand
it,
the
term
does
not
mean
duplicating
recoveries.
and
i
don't
understand...
and
this
is
what
i
want
you
to
explain...
why
there
couldn't
be
a
recovery
in
a
case
analogous
to
this
both
by
the
fcm
and
by
the
ultimate
customer.
let's
assume
that
the
settlement
price
is,
in
fact,
rigged.
the
fcm
cannot
meet
the
resulting
margin
call
and
folds,
and
hence
a
situation
like
this.
and
this
happens
quickly
enough
so
that
the
ultimate
transaction
is
never
consummated.
so
that
the...
the
contracting
party
on
the
fcm
side
of
the
trade
doesn't
get
the
benefit
of
what
would
have
been
a
favorable
contract.
couldn't
you
have
recovery
in
that
case
both
by
the
customer
and
the
fcm?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
be
that
i
don't
understand
how
it
works.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
my
hypo,
the
fcm
is
claiming
damages
because
his
business
folds.
so
the
damages
are
not
limited
simply
to
those
flowing
from
this
transaction
itself.
the
customer
is
claiming
damages
for
failure
to
consummate
a
contract
that
would
have
been
favorable
to
him.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
i
am
assuming--
justice
david
h.
souter
neither
are
they
the
person
who
can
end
up
personally
liable,
and...
i
mean,
they
don't
have...
they
are
not
subject
to
margin
calls.
there
is
something
very
different
about
this
set
of
relationships
from
the
broker/seller
relationship
in
buying
and
selling
a
house.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
saying
that
because
a
trade
is
on
or
subject
to,
the
only
thing
that
can
be
on
or
subject
to
is
a
trade.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that...
that's
the
point
at
which
we
have
difficulty
following
your
argument.
why...
what
is
your
reason,
textual
or
otherwise,
for
saying
that
because
a
trade
is
on
or
subject
to,
no
other
subtransaction
can
be
on
subject
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
if...
if
your
ultimate,
let's
say,
policy
reason
for
confining
it
to
that
is
the...
is
the
policy
against
multiple
recovery.
justice
david
h.
souter
their
current
argument
is,
basically,
that's
all
congress
was
thinking
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
as
i
understand
your
position,
it's
something
more.
congress
was
also
thinking
probably
about
multiple
recovery,
and
it
didn't
want
that.
and
we
will
impute
that
intent
to
congress
because
multiple
recovery
would
be
a
very
bad
thing
for
the
industry.
that's
basically
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
