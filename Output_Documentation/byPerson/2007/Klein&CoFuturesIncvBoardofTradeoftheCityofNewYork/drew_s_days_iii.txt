mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
clearing
futures
commodity
merchant,
an
fcm,
such
as
petitioner,
has
standing
to
sue
contract
markets
and
clearing
organizations
of
contract
markets
under
section
25
(b)(1)
of
the
act
for
their
bad
faith
failure
to
enforce
rules
that
are
required
by
the
act
and
by
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission.
the
court
of
appeal's
contrary
ruling
should
be
reversed
for
three
reasons,
because
it's
contrary
to
the
text
of
25(b)(1),
it
ignores
the
essential
rule
of
clearing
fcm's
such
as
petitioner
recognized
by
the
commodity
exchange
act,
as
well
as
long-standing
industry
rules
and
practices...
an
assessment
with
which
the
expert
federal
agency,
the
commodity
future
trading
commission
concurs...
and
it's
in
cross
purposes
with
the
goal
that
congress
sought
to
achieve
in
enacting
an
express
private
right
of
action
in
25(b)(1)
against
contract
markets,
namely
to
ensure
the
existence
of
fair
and
orderly
markets
through
a
system
of
effective
subregulation.
the
plain
language
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
confers
statutory
standing
on
petitioner
to
bring
this
private
right
of
action
against
respondents.
25(b)(1)
makes
no
reference
to
buyer
or
seller
but
instead
confers
standing
on
any
person
who
engaged...
a
person
who
engaged
in
any
transaction
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
contract
market
or
licensed
board
of
trade.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
we
view
this
as
several
subsidiary
transactions
that
ultimately
end
in
the
consummation
of
the
contract,
but
with
respect
to
the
rules
that
we
have
in
mind...
first
of
all
rule
6
(a)
talks
about...
that
can
be
found
in
the
blue
brief
at
1a...
that
such
contract
executed
or
consummated
by
or
through
a
member
of
such
contract
market.
this
is
a
clearing
fcm
that
does
this.
and
6
(a),
along
with
the
knife
rule,
that
is
the
contract
markets
rule
121(f)
and
306(i)(2),
essentially
indicate
the
following
arrangement:
no
contract
can
be
dealt
with
or
entered
into
on
a
contract
market
without
a
guarantee
from
the
clearing
fcm.
the
fcm
becomes
the
buyer
and
seller
with
respect
to
that
particular
contract.
it
assumes
that
contract
and
then,
after
assuming
that
contract,
has
to
clear
it
immediately,
indeed,
within
one
hour.
so
that's...
those
are
the
rules
under
the
statute
and
with
respect
to
the
contract
market.
with
respect
to
the
clearing
organization,
rule
401(a),
which
is
found
at
the
red
brief
at
6a,
indicates
that
the
clearing
point,
the
clearing
fcm
is
the
point
that
deals
with
the
clearing
organization.
and
at
that
point,
there's
no
communication,
no
contact...
no
contract
between
the
investor
and
the
clearing
organization.
the
clearing
organization
becomes
the
buyer
and
seller.
in
other
words,
the
contract
is
between
a
clearing
fcm
on
one
side
of
the
contract
and
a
clearing
fcm
on
the
other
side
of
the
contract.
the
clearing
organization
becomes
the
buyer
and
seller,
but
before
that
happens,
it's
clear
that
the
clearing
organization
views
the
clearing
fcm
as
the
party
to
the
contract.
it
is
not
the
investor.
it
is
not
any
other
party.
the
important
thing
also
about
this
process
is
that
the
clearing
fcm
is
always
financially
liable
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
transaction,
this
process,
to
the
very
end.
that
is,
from
the...
executing
the
contract
and
the
consummation
of
the
contract.
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
talk
about
buyer
or
seller
and
treat
a
clearing
fcm
as
a
mere
creditor
or
agent
really
misses
entirely
the
role
that
clearing
fcm's
play
in
this
process.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
it's...
it
is
clear,
as
i
indicated
with
respect
to
the
rule
of
the
contract
market,
that
the
clearing
fcm
is
required
to
clear
that
particular
order
or
contract.
and,
therefore,
at
that
point,
the
clearing
requires
some
information
about
the
settlement
price.
here
the
allegation
is
that
there
was
fraud
at
the
point
where
the
settlement
price
was
set.
that
then
created
a
problem
with
the
clearinghouse,
and
at
the
clearing
process
there
was
also
a
continuing
violation
because
at
both
points
the
contract
market
and
the
clearing
organization
should
have
been
applying
their
rules
effectively
and
carefully,
and
we
suggest
here
that
that
was
done
in
bad
faith.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
cause
of
action,
we
understand,
requires
that
there
be
a
showing
of
bad
faith.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
in
fact,
the...
in
order
to
be
a
contract...
a
market
designated
by
the
cftc
and
by
the
statute,
there
has
to
be
a
commitment
to
avoiding
price
manipulation
and
cornering
the
market
or
various
other
things
of
that
kind.
so
that's
in
the
statute,
and
it's
also
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
cftc.
that's
a
basic
understanding.
that's
a
given.
indeed,
with
respect
to
the
whole
question
of
settlement
prices
and
margins,
the
understanding
of
those
who
participate
in
a
commodity
futures
market
is
that
they
will
establish
their
margins
with
the
expectation
that
those
rules
will
be
applied
fairly
and
firmly
and
in
good
faith.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
excuse
me?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
what--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--absolutely.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
this
is
a
standing
case,
sir.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
congress
had
in
mind
a
limitation
of
the
standing
position...
that
is
standing...
a
right
to
those
who
participate
in
the
process,
when
it
talks
about
a
person
who
engaged
in
a
transaction
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
contract
market--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
a
transaction
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
contract
market.
she
would
not
or
he
would
not
be
a
person
whose
transaction,
that
is
the
employment
contract,
would
be
carried
out
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
contract.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
the
statute
itself
talks
about
the
responsibilities
of
the
contract
market
or
the
clearing
organization.
and
it
describes
transactions,
and
transactions
are
described
broadly
but
not
in
a
way
that
would
encompass
the
examples
that
you
gave,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
it's
derived
from
the
statute,
if
one
looks
at
rule
2(i)
in
the
statute.
that
describes
transactions
in
a
variety
of
ways.
it's
not
in
any
of
the
appendices,
but
it
can
be
located,
i
believe,
on
page
5
of
the
yellow
brief,
where
we
talk
about
that
and
indeed
the
interpretation
that
was
given
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
ken
roberts
case,
which
we
also
cite
at
that
page
in
the
yellow
brief.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
want
to
focus
on
transaction.
there's
nothing
that
i've
been
able
to
find,
nothing
that
the
cftc
has
indicated
in
this
respect
that
would
cover
the
hypothetical
that
you
and
chief
justice
roberts
had
mentioned.
theoretically,
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that...
in
fact
not
theoretically,
yes,
i
would
say
the
transaction
does
not
incorporate
those
ancillary
rules
of
an
operation
of
a
contract
market.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
it
is
a
broad
definition,
but
it
focuses
on
the
process
of
the
execution
and
consummation
of
the
contract,
not
matters
that
are
unrelated.
i
would
view,
as
was
indicated
in
the
american
agricultural
movement
case,
these
people
as
nonparticipants
in
the
operation
of
the
core
function
of
a
contract
market.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
right.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.

mr.

mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
i
don't
know,
justice
breyer,
whether
you're
heading
toward
the
concern
that's
expressed
by
the
respondents,
namely
that
25(b)(1)
does
not
contain
in
that
second
part
of
the
statute
a
reference
to
a--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--clearing
organization.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think
that
is...
"so
what"
is
a
proper
response,
i'm
glad
you
said
it
rather
than
i,
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--we
have...
we
have,
we
think,
standing
with
respect
to
a
transaction
that
occurred
on
the
contract
market
even
if
the
respondents'
argument
is
persuasive
that
it
didn't
happen
on
the
clearing
organization
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
clearing
organization.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
well--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
limitations
with
respect
to
25(b)(1).
as
i
indicated,
nonparticipants
in
the
market
are
not
explicitly
covered
by
this,
but
also
one
has
to
understand
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
bad
faith
and
there
are
no
punitive
damages.
there
are
actually
damages
and,
therefore,
this
limits
the
extent
to
which
this
provision
can
be
used
by
someone
who
is
not
within
the
category
that
i
described.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
as
to
him,
yes--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
is
right.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that's
not
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that's
not
correct,
justice
breyer.
the
clearing--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
it's
hard
to
know
who
walks
on
what
floor.
i
think
what
is
clear
about
this
industry
is
that
it
is
the
clearing
fcm
who
is
always
at
the
center
of
this,
the
essential
participant
in
this
entire
process.
the
fcm's
may
not
know
who
the
customer
is.
they
certainly
don't
know
who
the
customer
is
on
the
other
side.
the
clearinghouse
doesn't
know
who
the
customer
is,
or
the
investor
is.
so
the
investor
actually
plays
a
very
small
role
other
than
putting
up
his
or
her
money
at
the
beginning
of
the
process.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
we
don't
argue
that
investors
are
barred
from
bringing
suits
under
25(b)(1).
they
would
be
persons
who
engaged
in
transactions
on,
or
subject
to,
the
rules
of
the
contract
market.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
that...
that's
certainly
been
the
case
in
leist
where
judge
friendly
wrote
the
opinion.
and
also--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
mentioned--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
one...
the
contract
market
requires
that
the
clearing
fcm
clear
a
contract
with
one
hour...
assume
the
contract.
so
the
assuming
of
the
contract
and
the
clearing
required
by
the
rules
of
the
contract
market
is
a
violation
of
the
cea.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
your
honor,
as
indicated,
the
transaction
is
the
process
of
assuming
this
contract
and
then
going
toward
the
clearing...
clearing
organization
to
clear
it,
and
it's
the
clearing
organization,
setting
the
settlement
price,
which
really
dictates
what
happens
on
the
clearing
organization.
so
it's
the
setting
of
the
settlement
price
which
is
the
key
point.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
there
are
two
parties
here.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
there
is
a...
we
can
view
this
as
one
sole
transaction,
as
one
transaction
with
a
number
of
subsidiary
activities
along
the
process
between
execution
and
consummation,
or
one
can
view
various
transactions
that
ultimately
end
up
with
the
consummation
of
the
contract.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
one
way
or
another.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
oh,
absolutely.
well,
they
are
same
thing.
you
mean
the
clearing
fcm
and
the
organization.
thank
you.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
your
honors,
mr.
pincus
has
identified
what
he
views
as
some
temporal
gap
between
the
entering
into
a
contract
and
the
involvement
of
this...
the
clearing
fcm.
that
simply
is
not
the
case.
klein
had
a
prior
commitment
to
clear
eisler's
trade;
so
even
at
the
time
that
eisler
was
trading,
that
had
to
be
done
with
the
understanding
that
klein
was
going
to
back
him
up.
if
one
looks
at
the
gray
brief
at
page
21,
it
references
to
the
rule
of
knight...
rules
of
knight
116
and
118
that
make
this
very
clear.
the
story
is,
as
we've
indicated,
that
throughout
this
process
the
clearing
fcm
is
financially
liable
and,
therefore,
is
on
the
hook.
when
congress
enacted
the
statute,
it
was
concerned
with
protecting
the
public
and
maintaining
credibility.
we
think
that
this
cause
of
action,
this
express
cause
of
action
for
allowing
fcms
to
sue,
is
most
reliant
to
the
objectives
of
congress:
the
faithful
execution
by
an
fcm
that
deals
directly
with
these
entities,
the
clearinghouse
and
the
commodity
contract
market.
thank
you
very
much.
