mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
court
may
assume
that
the
word
25(b)(1)
is
limited
to
the
purchase
and
sale
of
futures
and
options
contracts.
the
court
may
also
assume
that,
in
order
to
engage
in
such
a
transaction,
a
person
must
be
a
necessary
and
direct
participant
in
the
transaction.
even
under
those--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--when
i
say
"assume",
i
am
saying
that
the
court
need
not
decide
at
this
point
how
far,
if
at
all,
beyond
the
core
transactions
that
occur
on
contract
markets
the
statute
breaches.
that
is,
with
respect
to
the
hypothetical
case
of
an
exchange
or
a
clearinghouse
that
has
an
anti-discrimination
rule
and
is
alleged
to
have
violated
that
rule.
yes,
on
the
one
hand,
you
could
say
that
in
literal
terms
that
is
a
transaction
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
exchange.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
there
is
significant
force
to
respondents'
contention
that
that
seems
very
far
afield
from
what
was
the
core
of
congress's
concern.
and
with
respect
to
the
anti-discrimination
hypothetical,
there
would
also
be
the
argument
that
there
is
a
different
federal
statute.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
court
can
at
least
start
from
the
assumption
that
congress
referred
to
transactions
on,
or
subject
to,
the
rules
of
the
contract
market.
and
none
of
the
things
that
have
been
posited
in
the
hypotheticals,
the
anti-discrimination,
would
be
transactions
on
a
contract
market.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
they
would
be
subject
to
the
rules.
but
our
point
here
is
that
the
united
states
and
the
cftc
have
not
had
occasion
to
decide
how
far,
if
at
all,
beyond
the
core
transactions
on
the
contract
market
the
statute
extends.
but
our
point
is,
even
if
we
look
at
the
core
of
what
congress
was
driving
at,
the
buying
and
selling
of
futures
options
contracts,
the
clearing
fcm
is
a
proper
plaintiff
because
it
assumes
direct
contractual
liability
to
the
clearinghouse.
even
before
the
clearing
process
is
completed,
it
was
defined
as
the
buyer
or
seller
of
the
contracts
in
the
nyfe
rules,
and
its
participation
is
essential.
now...
now,
we
have
a
somewhat
different
conception
of
the
relevant
transaction
than
does
the
petitioner.
in
our
view,
when
eisler
executed
his
trades
on
the
floor
of
the
exchange,
he
set
in
motion
a
process
that
would
quickly
and
inevitably
culminate
in
the
clearing
of
the
trades
by
the
clearing
organization,
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
there
would
be
an
array
of
contractual
relationships.
klein
would
have
a
contractal
obligation
to
the
clearinghouse.
the
clearing
fcm
on
the
other
side
of
the
trade
would
have
its
own
obligation
to
the
clearinghouse.
klein
would
have
an
agreement
with
its
customer,
first
west,
that
would
entail
rights
and
obligations
running
between
them.
and
there
would
be
a
similar
set
of
rights
and
obligations
on
the
other
side
of
the
trade.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
incorrect.
i
think
the
customer
would
also
be
an
appropriate
plaintiff,
that
is,
the
customer
would
have
his
own
rights
and
obligations
arising
out
of
the...
the
contract
with
the
clearing
fcm.
but
the
fact
that
they
might
both
be
conceivable
plaintiffs
wouldn't
mean
that
they
could
both
recover
in
the
same
case.
remember
that
the
statute
limits
recovery
to
actual
losses.
so
if
the
customer
here,
eisler
and
first
west,
had
paid
the
required
additional
margin
to
klein,
and
klein
had
discharged
its
obligation
to
the
clearinghouse,
klein
would
still
be
a
person
who
had
engaged
in
a
transaction.
but
klein
wouldn't
be
able
to
recover
because
he
would
have
suffered
no
actual
losses.
so
it's
the
person
who
bears
the
actual
loss
at
the
end
of
the
day
who
would
be
the
appropriate
plaintiff.
and
the
fact
that
in
some
cases
that
might
be
the
customer
and
in
other
cases
it
might
be
the
clearing
fcm
doesn't
mean
that
there
would
be
duplicative
recovery
in
a
single
case.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
a
purchase
or
sale,
although
we
would
extend...
i
mean
we
would
interpret
the
clearing
process
as
part
of
the
purchase
or
sale.
and
the
reason
we
would
do
that
is
that
clearing
occurs
inevitably
by
operation
of
law,
as
it
were.
that
is,
once
eisler
executes
his
trades,
klein
has
no
discretion
as
to
whether
to
discharge
its
obligation
to
clear
the
trades.
klein
had
previously
entered
into
a
commitment
to
guarantee
the
trades
that
eisler
made.
and,
therefore,
what...
klein's
obligations
to
the
clearinghouse
followed
directly
and
inevitably
from
the
initial
trade
on
the
floor
of
the
exchange.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it
is
a
different
thing
and
there
are
two
different
bases
on
which
the
court
could
rule
in
our
favor,
that
is,
rule
306(i)(2)
of
the
rules
of
the
exchange
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
these
trades
specified
that...
and
that's
reproduced,
i
guess,
at
page
14a
of
the
blue
brief.
and
it
said...
a
second
sentence
of
rule
306(i)(2)
says
every
such
contract
when
made
by
a
trading
member
shall
be
made
on
behalf
of
a
clearing
member,
who
shall
be
the
buyer
or
seller
of
said
contract
on
the
terms
set
forth
therein.
so
one
way
to
rule
for
klein
in
this
case
is
to
simply
say
even
if
we
focus
entirely
on
the
moment
at
which
the
trade
was
executed,
under
the
rules
of
the
exchange,
klein
was
deemed
to
be
the
buyer
or
seller.
but
we
are
also
making
the
different
argument
and
in
a
sense
we
think
the
more
important
practical
argument,
that
regardless
of
where
the
contract
ran
during
the
brief
period
before
the
clearing
process
was
consummated,
the
salient
factor
is
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
clearing
process,
the
clearinghouse
would
look
directly
and
only
to
klein
for
satisfaction
of
any
obligations
arising
out
of
unsuccessful
trades.
in
a
sense
the
clearinghouse
could
be
analogized
to
a
department
store
in
which
only
the
clearing
members
have
charge
accounts.
and
in
order
for
anyone
else
to
make
a
purchase,
he
has
to
make
prearrangements
with
a
charge
account
holder
to
have
permission
to
charge
things
to
his
accounts.
and
that's
essentially
what
was
done
here.
in
order
for
eisler
to
execute
trades
on
the
floor
of
the
exchange,
he
had
to
have
the
prior
commitment
from
klein
that
eisler
would
be
allowed
to
charge
trades
to
client's
account.
and
in
that
situation,
we
think
it's
entirely
natural
to
say
that
klein
engaged
in
the
transaction,
even
though
eisler
was
making
the
decisions
as
to
exactly
what
trades
to
execute.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
i
think
the
second
circuit's
error
was
not
really
that
it
had
a
misconception
of
how
narrow
or
broad
the
private
right
of
action
is.
the
second
circuit's
error
was
that
it
misunderstood
the
role
that
a
clearing
fcm
plays
in
the
process.
the
clearing
fcm
doesn't
simply
facilitate
the
formation
of
contracts
between
other
people.
the
clearinghouse
assumes
direct
contractual...
i'm
sorry.
i
mean
the
clearing
fcm
assumes
direct
contractual
liability
to
the
clearinghouse.
and
that's
fundamental
to
the
operation
of
the
contract
markets.
that
is,
the
point
of
the
clearinghouse
is
to
give
investors
assurance
that
if
their
trades
are
successful,
they
will
get
paid.
and
in
order
for
the
clearinghouse
to
pay
the
winners,
it
has
to
have
confidence
that
it
will
be
able
to
collect
from
the
losers.
and
the
way
that
it
has
that
confidence
is
by
identifying
a
small
number
of
people,
clearing
fcm's,
who
have
demonstrated
financial
wherewithal
and
integrity,
and
saying
we
are
going
to
look
only
to
you
to
satisfy
these
obligations.
we
are
not
going
to
put
ourselves
in
the
business
of
going
after
large,
large
numbers
of
individual
investors
to
ensure
that
losing
trades
will
be
paid.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
sure
if
i...
if
i
fully
understand
the
hypothetical.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
to
answer
a
variant
of
it,
i
think
there
could
be
cases
in
which
both
the
customer
and
the
clearing
fcm
recovered
something.
that
is,
say
there
is
a
loss
of
a
million
dollars
that's
attributable
to
malfeasance
by
the
exchange,
and
the
customer
comes
up
with
half
of
that
money...
$500,000.
and
the
clearinghouse
uses
that
to
discharge
half
of
its
own
obligation
to
the
clearinghouse.
now,
in
that
case,
both
the
customer
and
the
clearing
fcm
might
have
a
cause
of
action
for
$500,000.
so
there
would
be...
there
could
be
multiple
recoveries
in
the
sense
that
you're
describing.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
you
assume
that
consequential
damage
is
arising
out
of
the
loss
of
the
business--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--could
be
part
of
actual
losses,
then
there
would
be
no
barrier
to
each
party,
the
clearing
fcm
and
the
customer
recovering
what
it
actually
lost.
our
point
is
that
there
is
no
danger
that
because
the
clearing
fcm
is...
there
is
no
danger
that
because
the
clearing
fcm
is
liable
for
a
million
dollars
to
the
clearinghouse
and
the
customer
is
liable
to
the
clearing
fcm,
each
for
a
million
dollars,
that
they
will
both
get
a
million
dollars.
it's
only
the
person
who
bears
the
actual
loss.
