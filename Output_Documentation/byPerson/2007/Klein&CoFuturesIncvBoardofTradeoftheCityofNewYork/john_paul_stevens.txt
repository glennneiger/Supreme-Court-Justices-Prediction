but
even
if
it's
a
term
of
art,
do
you
contend
that
client
was
not
engaged
in
a
transaction
subject
to
the
rules.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
scope
of
the
term
"transaction"
in
your
view?
what
does
it
cover?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact
between
either
the
buyer
or
the
seller
and
the
clearinghouse,
not
the
clearinghouse,
the
fcm
or
whatever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
who
are
the
parties
to
the
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
intermediaries
are
not
subject
to
the
transaction
either
though
they
are
liable
either
for
the
purchase
rights
or
the
sale
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
not
parties
to
the
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
can
expose
them
to
millions
of
dollars
in
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
are
subject
to
liability
if
the
transaction
doesn't...
isn't
consummated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
persons
engaged
in
contracts
subject
to
the
rules...
are
they
persons
engaged
in
transactions
subject
to
the
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
are
subject
to
the
rules
in
your
view?
it
doesn't
include
the
fcm,
it
doesn't
include
the
broker,
it
doesn't
include
the
trader.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
under
the
impression
from
the
briefs,
and
maybe
i'm
wrong,
that
you
did
not
defend
the
reasoning
of
the
second
circuit.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
was
the
principal
basis
for
its
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
mr.
pincus,
even
if
you
limit
it
to
the
word
"trades",
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
only
parties
to
the
trade
are
the
original
buyer
and
the
original
seller.
there
are
two
intermediates
who
participate
in
the
execution
of
the
trade.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
include
this
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
do
you
say
that
klein
had
no
role
in
it?
it
was
an
indispensable
party
to
the
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
it
was
completed
he
participated,
he
was...
he
functioned
as
a
guarantor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
cleared
by
the
time
it
was
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
distinction
between
a
and
d,
but
before
it
can
be
consummated
b
and
c
have
to
play
a
role.
justice
john
paul
stevens
aren't
there
lots
of
situations
in
which
a
various...
serious...
harms
a
whole
bunch
of
people,
and
they
all
recover?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
agree
if
the
client
had
been
trading
on
its
own
account
with
a
scalper,
it
would
have
been
able
to
recover
for
the...
for
its
loss
to
itself;
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
trading
for
itself
and
some
for
other
customers,
it
only
can
recover
half
of
those.
does
that
make
sense?
