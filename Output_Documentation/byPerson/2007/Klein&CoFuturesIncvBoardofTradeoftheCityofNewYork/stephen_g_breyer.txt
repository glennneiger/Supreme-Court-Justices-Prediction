justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you...
i
find
it
difficult...
i'm
finding
it
difficult
to
follow
the
exact
language
on
page
4a
of
the
appendix,
of
(b)(1)(c).
to
you,
that's
probably
the
key
provision,
right?
and
that's
in
the
blue
brief.
and
catch
me
when
i
read
it
wrong,
if
i
do.
as
i...
as
i
see
it,
it
says...
and
here
it
says
"a
clearing
organization".
that's
what
we
are
interested
in
here,
the
clearing
organization.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
a
clearing
organization
that
doesn't
enforce
a
bylaw
properly
or
a
rule
or
reg
properly,
which
is
what
you're
saying
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
clearing
organization
got
all
mixed
and
it
all--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
they're
liable
for
actual
damages
to
a
person
who
engaged
in
a
transaction
in
a
contract
market.
that's
what
it
says.
and
the
contract
market
is
the
futures
exchange.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
the
clearing
organization.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they're
liable
to
that
person
for
the
actual
losses
that
resulted
from
his
transaction
in
the
futures
exchange...
as
such
transaction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
your
claim...
they
were
caused
by
the
failure
of
the
clearinghouse
to
follow
its
rules.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
just
read
that,
we
have
a
case
where
the
clearing
organization
didn't
follow
its
rules
the...
my
client
engaged
in
a
transaction
over
the
futures
exchange.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
was
caused
harm
because
the
clearing
organization
didn't
follow
its
rules.
you
say
that's
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
i
understand
that
correctly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
clearing
organization.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
then
the
response
i'm
going
to
ask
them
is,
so
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you're
going
to...
but
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
you're
going
to
be
more
favorable
to
this
than
i
expect
your
opponent.
i
mean,
there
is
nothing
really
linguistically
or
otherwise
wrong
if
you
had
a
statute
that
said
people
in
the
badminton
court
have
to
play
carefully.
and
if
they
hurt
somebody
on
the
merry-go-round,
they
are
liable.
and
so
people
in
the
contract
market
have
to
play
carefully,
and
if
they
have
hurt
somebody
over
at
the
futures
exchange,
they
are
liable.
but
it
says
those
people
in
the
futures
exchange
are
people
who
engage
in
a
transaction
on
the
futures
exchange.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
they
said
well,
by
odd
fluke
of
fate,
your
clients
didn't.
it
was
the...
rather,
their
client
who
actually
went
into
the
futures
exchange
and
bought
the
commodity.
your
point,
i
take
it,
is...
well
that's
true,
but
my
client
did
something,
he
guaranteed
that
commodity
transaction
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
futures
exchange,
and
that's
what
makes
him
a
player
in
the
futures
exchange.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
guaranteed
through
the
clearinghouse
the
payment
of
the
contract
made
on
the
futures
exchange--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
he
didn't
make,
but
he
guaranteed
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
made
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
didn't
walk
on
to
the
floor
and
make
it.
it
was
his
client
who
walked
on
to
the
floor
and
said
whatever.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
had
to
pick
it
up
in
an
hour.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so
therefore
any
transaction
wouldn't
happen
in
your
hypothetical,
because
if
i
understand
it
correctly...
the
buyer
and
the
seller,
who
by
the
way
are
normally
represented
by
clearing-houses
by
klein,
or
by
brokers
like
klein,
but
in
this
case
apparently
they
weren't...
they
make
the
transaction
in
the
pit
and
then
the
rules
of
the
exchange
say
that
the
clearing-house
has
to
pick
it
up,
a
clearing
member
within
one
hour,
and
at
that
point
that
person...
the
clearing
member,
the
broker,
i
guess,
this
klein
type
person...
becomes
legally
responsible
for
seeing
that
the
money
is
put
up.
now,
it
doesn't
require
a
big
stretch...
in
fact,
zero
stretch,
of
the
word
transaction,
to
think
that
word
transaction
covers
that
entire
process.
from
the
moment...
and
by
the
way
the
whole
process
is
governed
by
the
rules
of
the
futures
exchange...
so
there
are
rules
in
there.
so
why
do
you...
what
reason
is
there
for
taking
that
word
transaction,
cutting
out
about
two-thirds
of
the
important
event,
ignoring
the
fact
that
it
is
covered
by
the
rule
of
the
future
exchange,
and
limiting
it
to
the
physical
moment
when
somebody
enters
the
pit
in
an
unusual
case
and
says
"i
buy
for"...
and
then
another
person
says
"i
sell
for"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
is
there
any
reason
that
the
word
"transaction"
would
have...
serves
a
purpose
by
being
so
limited?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
congress
would
congress
have
wanted
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
a
reason.
i
want
to
know
what
reason,
what
harm
will
be
done
if
in
fact
we
take
the
word
"transaction"
and
say
the
word
"transaction",
while
it's
capable
of
the
interpretation
you
give,
is
also
capable
of
an
interpretation
that
includes
all
the
near
contemporaneous
events,
including
the
financing
and
guarantees?
like
a
mortgage
in
selling
a
house.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
also
is
linguistically
possible.
what
harm
will
be
done--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
the
second
is
chosen
and
not
the
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
got
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
got
that
when
you
said
there
were
two.
what's
the
second?
