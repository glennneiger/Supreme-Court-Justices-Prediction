well,
when
you
began
by
saying
we
could
begin...
we
could
assume
certain
things,
was
it
included
in
the
things
that
we
could
assume...
was
it
the
proposition
that
the
transaction
was
limited
to
a
purchase
or
sale?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
different
from
saying
under
the
exchange
rule
the
fcm
is
actually
the
party
that
enters
into
the
trade.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
is
the
clear...
there
is
no
clear
definition.
there
is
no
definition
whatsoever,
anywhere,
of
"transaction".
