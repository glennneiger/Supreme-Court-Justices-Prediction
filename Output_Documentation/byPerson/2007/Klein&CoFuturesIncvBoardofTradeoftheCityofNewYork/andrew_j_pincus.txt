mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
because
i
think
it
explains
why
the
comments
that
mr.
stewart
started
with
are,
in
fact,
compelled
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
25
(a)
talks
about
a
person
who
engages
in
any
transaction
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
contract
market.
and
i'm
focusing
on
the
"on
or
subject
to
the
rules.
"
if
the
petitioners
claimed
in
their
opening
brief
any...
the
fact
that
any
transaction
was
governed
by
any
rule,
as
in
the
court's
discrimination
hypotheticals,
was
enough,
then
the
"on"
would
be
superfluous.
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
for
"on",
because
surely
a
transaction
on
a
contract
market
has
to
be
governed
by
the
rules
of
the
contract
market.
so
i
think
that
shows
why
"on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of.
"
is
a
term
of
art.
it
has
a
special
meaning
here.
and
the
only
kinds
of
transactions
that
are
either
on
or
subject--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
what
congress
was
explaining
there
is
it
wasn't
saying
any
transaction
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
contract
market,
because
that
would
be
all
of
the
court's
hypotheticals
and
discrimination
and
everything
else,
and
the
word
"on"
wouldn't
be
there.
and
so
by
using
"on",
which
by
definition
"on"
has
to
be
subsumed
in
the
rules
because
if
a
transaction
is
on
a
contract
market,
surely
is
in
some
way
governed
by
a
rule.
so
if
congress
meant
to
cover
every
transaction
that
is
in
any
way
governed
by
a
rule,
it
wouldn't
have
had
to
include
"on".
so
the
reason...
the
fact
that
"on"
is
there
means,
as
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
that
this
is
a
special
transaction
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
singles
out
a
very
special
category
of
transactions.
and
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
but
the
fact
that
congress
put
"on"
in
there
means
that
it
was
trying
to
capture
something
other--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
the
reason
that
"on"
is
there
is
that
congress
was
signaling
that
it
wasn't,
that
the
second
part
of
the
clause
or
"subject
to
the
rules"
didn't
literally
mean
or
subject
to
any
rule,
because
if
it
literally
meant
that,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
include
"on".
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no.
this
is
an
argument
that
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
that
a
transaction
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
is
a
special
kind
of
transaction.
it's
a
term
of
art
in
the
statute,
and
a
term
of
art
that
refers
to
trades.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
we
do.
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
the
transaction
that
is
referred
to
there
are
the
transactions
that
include,
either
at
the
trading
pit
or
a
small
category
of
off
pit
trades
that
are
permitted
by
section
c
of
the
commodities
exchange
act.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
covers
the
trade...
the
contract
that
occurs
at
the
pit
at
the
moment...
during
open
when
one--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
fcms
may
or
may
not
be
involved.
in
this
case
klein
wasn't
involved,
because
eisler
was
a
floor,
had
floor
privileges
and
he
actually...
he
was
the
person
who
was
at
the
pit
engaging
in
these
transactions.
so
our...
our
view
is
that
the
transaction,
to
start
with
that,
either
occurs
at
the
pit
when
an
offer
is
made,
an
open
outcry,
and
it's
accepted
at
that
moment
that
transaction
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
parties
to
that
transaction
are
the
buyer
and
seller,
the
customers,
the
people
that
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
they
are
not
parties
to
the
transaction.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
at
the
moment,
your
honor,
they
may
not
even
be
identified.
at
the
moment
that
transaction
occurs--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--under
the
rules
of
the
clearing
organization.
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
it
could...
what
the
clearing
process
does
after
the...
after
that
contract
is
formed
is
to
eliminate,
to
provide
a
way
to
strip
out
the
credit
risk
that
ordinarily
wouldn't
be
there.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
the
contract
is
a
nullity.
and
in
fact,
if
for
example
a
he
contract
was
made
at
the
pit,
and
for
some
reason
the...
the
clearing
member
who
was
to
clear
the
transaction
went
bankrupt
that
day
and
didn't
exist,
and
therefore
that
transaction
was
not
cleared,
that
transaction
would
still
be
enforceable
as
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
it
has
to
be
cleared
in
an
hour
to
go
through
the
clearing
process.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
let
me
first
point
out,
your
honor,
it's
not
an
unusual
case.
there
frequently
may
be
a
case
even
where...
either
where...
even
where
both
sides
are
represented
by
floor
brokers,
where
the
floor
broker
who
is...
who
is
representing
the
party
in
the
trade
is
not
the
clearing
member.
that
happens
all
the
time
and
that's
why
the
rules
say
that
the
clearing
member
doesn't
have
to
even
be
designated
until
one
hour
after
the
trade.
so
hard
to
say
that
the
clearing
member
engages
in
that
transaction
on
the
floor
when
he...
when
it
may
not
be
designated.
the
reason
for
the
division
is
that
congress
set
out
a
clear
rule
here.
the
transaction
it
referred
to,
it
used
the
language
that
it
used
elsewhere,
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
particularly
in
defining
the
functions
of
floor
trader
and
floor
broker.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
do
say
that,
your
honor.
because...
let
me
address
first
your
question
about
why
congress
couldn't
use
buyer
or
seller.
here
congress
had
to...
needed
a
construction
that
would
link
the...
the
transaction
that
was
being
targeted
with
the
rules
of
the...
of
the
contract
market,
because
that
was
going
to
be
the
test
here,
was
it's
all
about
whether
or
not
contract
market
violated
its
rules,
and
so
it
needed
a
construction
that
referred
to
a
transaction
because
those
are
the
things
that
are
governed
by
the
rules
of
the
contract
market
that
might
be
misapplied
in
the
work...
in
the
way
that
a,
b
and
c
talk
about.
so
it
would
have
had
to...
even
if
it
had
used
the
phrase,
you
know,
"purchased"
or
"sold",
a
commodity
for
future
delivery
or
an
option
on
a
contract
for
future
delivery...
it
would
still
have
to
say
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
contract
market,
in
order
to
link
back
to
what
it
was
doing,
which
was
creating
a
cause
of
action
for
the
violation
of
the
contract
markets
own
rules
with
respect
to
a
transaction
that
was
subject
to
those
rules.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
because
it...
it
would
have
to
talk
about--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
because
then
in
the...
several
lines
down
it
talks
about
actual
loss
and
it
would
have
to
say
buyers
and
sellers
there
as
well.
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
it
would
be
referring
back
to
buyer
or
seller.
but
i
think
the
key
here
is
for
congress,
given
the
structure
of
the
act,
"any
transaction
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
contract
market.
"
is...
are
these
transactions.
those
are
the
only
transactions
that...
that
meet
that
test.
those
are
the
transactions,
that
very
same
phrase
is
used
in
defining
the
functions
of
the
floor
broker
and
the
floor
trader
who
execute
the
transactions
on
the
floor,
and
so
by
using
that
phrase,
congress
was
tying
back
to
something
that
it
had
a
clear
definition
of.
let
me--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
there
is
no
definition
of
transaction,
your
honor,
but
in
the
definitions
of
floor
trader
and
floor
broker,
the
phrase
"on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
contract
market.
"
appears
again
in
defining
what
they
do,
and
so
those
are
the
people
who
are
at
the
pit,
either
executing
for
their
own
account
or
for
a
customer's
account,
the
trades.
and
so
by
using
that
very
phrase
in
defining
what
they
do...
which
appears
by
the
way
on,
in
the
discussion
on
pages
5
and
6--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't...
we
don't
think
they
are,
because
they
are
acting
as--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
certainly
a
floor
trader
is
because
that's
someone
who
is
trading
for
his
own
account.
a
floor
broker
who's
merely
representing
a
customer
is
just
like
someone
at
a
house
closing,
if
you
can't
make
the
house
closing
you
appoint
someone
to
close
the
house.
they
aren't
the
ones
who
engage
in
the
transaction;
you
do.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
those
people
also
have...
well,
the...
the
floor
broker
is
not
subject
to
a
margin
call.
he
is
subject
to
liability
for
other
things
that
he
may
do
wrong,
but
for
his
role
as
a
floor
broker
he
is
not
subject
to
margin
responsibility.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
if
that
was
all
the
second
circuit
said,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
would
be
wrong,
but
the
second
circuit
recognized
that
the...
klein
here
had
a
risk,
a
credit
risk
because
it
had
backed
up
the
credit
of
its
customer,
eisler,
and
that's
why
in
the
lessons
learned
report
that
the
cftc--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
is
the
job
of
the
clearing
member
of
what
an
fcm
does.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
but
as
the
second
circuit
went
on
to
note,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
credit
risk
here,
that
klein
is
taking
a
risk
based
on
the
credit
of
his
customer
eisler...
as
the
cftc
noted,
there
is
nothing
in
the
rules
that
require
clearing
members
to
only
accept
minimum
margin,
and
it's
the
job
of
a
clearing
member
to...
to
look
into
both
the
credit-worthiness
of
its
customers
and
the
risks
of
the
various
transactions
that
are
open
and
demanding
more
margin.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
we
don't...
to
the
extent
petitioners
claim
that
the
second
circuit
based
its
reasoning
on...
on
the
imputation
into
25(b)
of
the
limitations
in
25(a),
we
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
there
was
a
second
basis
to
its
decision,
which
talked
about
the
fact
that
klein
didn't
engage
in
trading,
and
we
agree
with
that
basis
because
that's
what
we're
arguing
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
it...
it
certainly
would
be
better
if
the
phrase
"transaction
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
contract
market.
"
meant
"trade"
and
we
were
only
discussing
how
expansive,
how
elastic
the
definition
of
"trade"
was.
we
would
still
take
the
position
that
it's
not
elastic
enough
obviously
to
include
clearing
members,
but
we
think
that,
given
the
language
that
congress
used
and
the
fact
that
that
language
is
used
to
refer
to
that
"on
or
subject
to"
formulation
is
repeatedly
used
to
refer
to
trades,
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
trades
have
to
be
what
it
is.
otherwise,
when
the
statute
talks
about
the
fact
that
a
floor
broker
engages
in
activities
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
contract
market,
it
could
be
talking
about
discrimination
and
all
kinds
of
other
activities.
but
even
with
respect
to
the
narrower
formulation
urged
by
the
solicitor
general,
we
think
that
it
is
not
right
for
several
reasons:
first
of
all
the
language
of
the
statute,
as
i
said,
but
there's
a
clarity
problem.
if
once
you
move
beyond
that
contract
that
is
executed
and
becomes
complete
on
the
pit,
how
far
do
you
go?
there's
clearing
before
the
contract
is
executed
on
the
pit...
at
the
pit.
there
may
be
antecedent
activities...
for
example,
someone
who
doesn't
have
floor
privileges
has
to
go
through
an
fcm.
there
may
be
an
introducing
broker
that
introduces
that
customer
to
the
fcm
or
all
of
those
activities
which
are
specified
in
the
statute
just
like
the
subsequent
clearing
activity
is
specified
in
the
statute.
are
they
also
shoe-horned
into
the
definition
of
trade?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
that's
where--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
although
obviously
the
parties
haven't
briefed
the
current
law.
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
current
law
doesn't
change
the
equation
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no.
our
position
is,
again,
the
"on
or
subject
to"
language,
we
believe,
quite
clearly
refers
to
trades
and
that
congress's
technical
correct
substitution
of
registered
entities
doesn't
change
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because...
because
trades
are
the
only
thing
that
fit
those
two
criteria.
only
trades
are...
can
be
under
the
statute
either
on
the
contract
market,
either
because...
because
they
are
executed
at
the
pit
or
so-called
off-market
trades
as
referred
to
in
section
6(c)...
very
small
categories
of
off-market
transactions--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
are
the
equivalent
of
trades
but
can
occur
off-market.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
second
part
of
our
argument.
once
we
reach
the
point
where
it's
trade,
then
the
question
is
what
does
trade
mean?
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
we
believe
that
it...
there
are...
at
the
pit,
again,
that
the
transaction,
the
on
transaction,
the
transaction
that
occurs
on,
is
the
open
outcry
transaction
where,
in
this
case,
eisler
made
an
offer
and
some
other
floor
trader
accepted
it,
and
that
was
complete
there.
klein
has
no
role
in
that
transaction,
and
clearing
members
do
not
have
a
role
in
that
transaction.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
they
come
in
later.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
was
a
subsequent
party.
it
had
subsequent
role--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
it
was
not...
it
need
not
be
clear
at
the
moment
of
that
the
trade
is
executed
at
the
pit
who
the
clearing
member
will
be.
often
it
won't
be.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no...
well,
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
"over",
your
honor.
what
happens
in
the
process,
if
i
can
just
lay
it
out
for
one
minute,
is
the
transaction
occurs
at
the
pit.
it's
recorded.
the
clearing
member--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
that
activity
is
over.
i'll
try
to
use
neutral
words.
that
activity
at
the
pit
is
over.
the
next...
that
data,
who
bought,
who
sold,
and
maybe
the
clearing
members
for
those
two
parties
are
identified.
maybe
they're
not.
they
might
not
be
identified
for
an
hour
according
to
the
rules.
so
something
happened
at
the
pit.
it's
then
entered
into
the
computers,
and
at
some
subsequent
point,
yes,
the
clearing
members
will
be
identified
and
the
trade
will
be
cleared.
our
point
is
that
is
subsequent
activity.
that
is
activity...
that's
the
clearing
process.
it's
important,
but
there
is
enforceable
contract
before
the
clearing
event
occurs.
nothing
in
the
rules
say
that
the
contract
is
unenforceable.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
in...
because
in
the
environment
that
congress
was
operating
just
following
this
court's
decision
in
curran,
the
focus
entirely
was
on
protecting
investors.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
harm
that
will--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
harm...
two
categories
of
harm:
first,
a
lack
of
clarity.
we
don't
know,
as
i
said,
how
far
back
are
we
going.
the
statute
requires,
for
customers
that
are
not
trade,
not
exchange
members,
they
have
to
go
to
an
introducing
broker.
they
have
to
go
then
to
an
fcm.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
a
rule
that
says
we're
going
to
read
"transaction"
broadly,
and
so
anyone
who
has
anything
to
do
with
any
aspect
of
the
trade,
either
before
it
or
afterward,
is
covered,
all
of
these
antecedent
people,
just
in
terms
of
the
statutory
language,
are
people
who
have
a
role.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
it's
hard
to
see
in
the
language
where
congress
would
have
drawn
the
line.
i
think
the
problem
is
the
lack
of
clarity.
we
certainly
won't
know,
if
the
court
says
we
are
going
to
move
beyond
this
core
transaction
and
encompass
some
of
the
ancillary
activities--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--okay.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
let
me
just
add
to
the...
to
the
first
that
there
are
subsequent
activities.
there
also
are
arrangements
set
up
with
banks
that
automatically
supply
margins,
that
facilitate
transactions.
and
so
the
question
will
be,
aren't
those
banks
who
play
an
important
liquidity
role,
aren't
they
part
of
a
transaction?
the
second
reason
is
the
reason
involved--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
they
are--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
it
has
to
have
an
arrangement,
and
that
fact
is
a
rule
of
the
exchange.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
so
it
depends
what
rule.
again,
we're--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--on
the
rule
where
we're
not
going
to
know
what
the
answer
is.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
it
does
have
that
concern,
justice
ginsburg,
which
is
why
mr.
stewart
said
that
the
court
should
sort
of
take
this
case
on
certain
assumptions
because,
as
he
recognized,
the
theory
that
even
the
government
put
forward
in
its
brief--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
it's
certainly
their
position
that
klein
has
standing,
but
in
terms
of
the
consequences
of
a
ruling
by
the
court
that
the
statute
goes
beyond
the
core
activity,
i
think
the
government's
suggestion
sort
of
shows
that
even
the
government
is
not
sure,
once
you
embark
on
that
exercise,
where
the
boundary
line
is.
and
i
would
point
out
the
government
is
not
asking
for
deference
in
this
case
nor
could
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
do,
your
honor,
and
the
second
reason
is
involved
in
the
government's
response
to
justice
souter's
question
about
multiple
recoveries.
if
all
of
these
various
people
can
assert
claims,
then
there
is
certainly
a
risk,
and
a
significant
risk,
that
all
of
these
various
people
will
assert
different
kinds
of
monetary
harm
that
they
will
claim
is
actual
loss.
in
this
case
the
principal,
actual
loss,
as
we
discussed
in
the
second
argument
in
our
brief,
is
claimed
as
the
loss
from
the
destruction,
allegedly
caused
from
the
destruction,
of
klein's
business.
if
there
was
a
bad-enough
event
on
an
exchange,
all
of
the
people
in
this...
in
the
row
from
the
introducing
broker
down
to
the
end,
down
to
the
bank,
could
claim
that,
because
there
was
a
foul-up
in
the
electronic
reporting
system
and
trades
were
misreported
for
a
week
and,
when
they
were
unwound,
the
consequences
of
that
where
lots
of
bankruptcies
in
the
futures
industry,
that
all
of
those
liabilities
get
pegged
to
the
contract
market.
as...
as
the
fia--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--there
are,
justice
stevens,
but
this
is
a
particular
kind
of
industry.
as
the...
as
the
futures
industry
association
notes
in
its
brief,
every
day
more
than
$5
trillion
worth
of
contracts
are
traded
on
futures
exchanges.
there
is
a
huge
amount
of
concentrated
risk
in
contract
markets.
if
the
contract
markets
are
going
to
be
made
liable
to
a
vast
array
of
people,
there
is
a
very
serious
risk
that
financial
jeopardy--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
if
it
had
been
trading
for
its
own
account.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
it
does,
because
klein
is
a
market
insider.
it
has
ways
to
protect
itself
other
than
suing
the
contract
market.
it
can
certainly
sue
its
customer.
it
has
ways
of
protecting
itself,
as
the
cftc
report
said,
in
terms
of
demanding
more
margin,
in
terms
of
watching
the
risk
in
its
customer's
portfolio,
in
terms
of...
of
hedging
its
own
risk.
it's
an
insider,
and
it
can
do
that.
what
congress
was
concerned
with
here...
and
the
reason
our
construction
of
the
statute
makes
sense...
is
that
it
protects
the
outsiders,
the
pc
investors
who
are
at
the
core
of
the
concern
here,
without
imposing
a
broad
array
of
liability
on
the
contract
markets,
who
are
in
the
middle
of
a
huge,
huge
amount
of
financial
risk,
which
really
puts
them
in
the
position
of
shouldering
risk
that's
intolerable.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
there
are
options.
i
mean
one
of
the
things
that
klein
says
here
is
that
this
is
its
only
option.
it
can
go
to
the
ftc.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
ftc
order
against
eisler
assessed
a
civil
penalty
but
then
said
the
order
could
be...
it
said
that
obligation
could
be
fufilled
by
paying
the
injured
parties.
klein...
to
the
extent
klein
has
an
injury,
the
ftc...
the
cftc
in
a
similar
case
could
do
the
same
thing.
there
are
state
law
claims.
there
are--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
it
does.
it
adds...
in
our
construction
"the
transactions
that
are
on"
are
the
transactions
that
occur
on
the
floor.
the
transactions
that
are
"subject
to
the
rules"
are
the
ex-pit
transactions.
once
you
say
mr.
days
of
anti-discrimination
rule.
so
it
has
to
have
a
limited
meaning;
and,
by
coupling
it
with
"on",
we
think
that
congress
made
clear
it
was
referring
to
trades.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because
then
you
wouldn't
capture
a
category...
because
then
congress
would
have
left
out
a
category
of
trades.
congress
meant
to
capture
investors
who
trade.
there
are
two
categories
of
transactions
that
meet
that
test:
those
that
occur
on
the
exchange,
on
the...
physically
on
the
pit,
and
those
that
are
within
the
industry
called
off-exchange
or
off-pit
transactions
defined
in
section
6(c)
of
the
act...
of
the...
of
the
statute.
and
so
by...
the
second
phrase
is
meant
to
capture
those
trades
that
may
involve
investors
but
don't
occur
at
the
pit.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
the
policy
reason
is
the
risk
of
multiple
recoveries
in
an
area
where
there
is
a
huge
amount
of
risk.
the
contract
market
is
at
the
center
of
things,
of
these
$5
trillion
a
day.
and
so
congress
wrote
very
carefully,
and
congress's
focus
was,
in
the
wake
of
curran...
and
given
what
it
said...
was
investors.
because
the...
the
implied
cause
of
action
that
the
court
recognized
in
curran
was
all
about
investors.
the
rationale--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
um,
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
rules
and
whether
the
rules
are
relevant
here.
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
used
a
phrase
in
the
statute,
and
that
it...
that
that
cannot
be
changed
by
a
rule
that
says...
if
an
exchange
adopted
a
rule
that
said
some
transaction
was
on,
or
subject
to,
the
rules
of
it,
that
wouldn't
be
enough
to
put
it
into
the
statutory
language.
the
test
is
what
congress
meant.
thank
you.
