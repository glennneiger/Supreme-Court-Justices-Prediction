mr.
days,
can
i
interrupt
you
there,
and
ask,
if
you
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
would
define
the
transactions...
the
particular
transactions
on
which
you
rely
to
come
within
that
provision
and
what
rules
of
the
exchange
or
the
clearinghouse
do
you
say
was
violated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
think
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you've
talked
about
the
transaction,
but
i
also
ask
you,
what
were
the
rules
that
the
defendants
violated,
the
rules
of
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
an
argument
for
this
case
because
that
absence
has
been
cured.
wasn't
that
in
the
2000
amendment
that...
that
they
changed
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
list
to
registered
entity
and
which
does
include
clearinghouse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
judge
friendly
refer
to
the
fcm
as
a
central
player
or
a
principal
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
isn't
it
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
guarantee,
the
relationship
between
the
clearing
organization
and
the
clearinghouse...
the
clearing
organization
has
to
give
a
guarantee
and
has
to
put
up
margin?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
is
a
transaction
between
the
clearinghouse
and
the
clearing
organization.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
if
we
accept
your
view
of
it,
allowing
the
fcm
to
sue,
then
there
could
be
multiple
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
why
the
second
circuit
was
wrong
in
saying
it
was
just
like
a
securities
broker?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pincus,
if
your
view
were
correct
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
congress
to
say
"buyers
and
sellers"
or
even
"trade",
but
it
used
a
word
"transaction"
that
you
say
has
a
special
meaning
in
this
context,
but
"transaction"
appears
all
through
the
law
and
usually
it's
a
term
that
has
encompassing
meaning,
like
in
the
federal
rules
"any
transaction
or
occurrence",
and
you
would
say
that
congress
has
given
it
here
this
very
constrained
meaning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
it
just
say
sustained
by
a
buyer
or
seller?
"shall
be
liable
for
actual
damages
sustained
by
a
buyer
or
seller.
"
why...
why
would
it
need
to
be
any
more
complicated
than
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
everything
else
is
the
same,
instead
of
"a
person",
just
"buyer
and
seller".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
know
why.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
recognize
that
the
second
circuit
was
wrong
when
it
said
that
this
fcm
is
just
like
a
securities
broker.
he
is
just
making
a
deal
for
a
commission.
it
seems
to
me
that
that...
that
was
not
proper.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
just
klein.
it's
every
fcm.
that
is
the
job
of
an
fcm.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's
not...
not
comparable
to
just
a
broker
who
executes
my
order
for
shares
and
gets
a
commission
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pincus--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--justice
kennedy
was
asking
you
about
the
government's
position.
one
of
the
positions...
one
aspect
of
the
government's
position
is
that...
that
you
would
not
dispute
that
a
person
who
engaged
in
a
transaction
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
clearinghouse
would
be
a
proper
plaintiff
under
the
current
law.
well,
certainly
the
fcm
is
a
person
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
clearinghouse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
i
thought
your
position
was.
so
that's
not
an
accurate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--characterization.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
only
one
that
has
this
relationship
that's
different
from
an
ordinary
broker,
the
only
one
is
the
fcm.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they're
not
people
who
are
at
risk.
i
mean
if
there...
if
it's
a
broker
who
was
just
executing
a
trade
for
a
commission
is
not
at
risk,
but
this
fcm
is
at
risk,
in
this
transaction,
series
of
transactions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
some--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
pincus--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the...
the
agency
that's
supposed
to
be
the
supervisor
of
this
area,
the
cftc,
is
taking
the
position
that
the
government
presented
to
us
today.
apparently,
it
doesn't
have
the
concern
that
you
have
just
expressed
about
reaching
people
who
are
not
themselves
subject
to
the
regulation
of
the
exchange,
the
clearinghouse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
what
he
was
telling
us
was
that,
even
if
you
assume
that
klein
has
that,
even
if
you've
assume
that.
