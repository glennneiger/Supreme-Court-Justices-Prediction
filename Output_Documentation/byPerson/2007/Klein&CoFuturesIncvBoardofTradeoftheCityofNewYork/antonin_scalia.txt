what
is
the
transaction...
what
is
the
single
transaction
that
you
think
brings
your
client
within
this
language?
justice

what

the
transaction,

i'm
not
talking
about
what
the
rule
is
that
was
violated.
it
says
"who
engaged
in
any
transaction
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
such
contract
market.
"
what
is,
in
brief,
"the
transaction"
you're
relying
upon?
justice

scalia
the
transaction
does
not
require
two
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
one-party
transaction?
justice
antonin

mr.
pincus,
will
you
satisfy
me
on
one
point.
i...
i
understand
your
argument
about
what
"transaction"
means.
but
even
if
i
accept
that
argument,
explain
to
me
again
why
"or
subject
to
the
rules"
doesn't
add
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
enough
to
just
say
"transactions
on"
if
that
was
their
meaning?
why
did...
did
they--
