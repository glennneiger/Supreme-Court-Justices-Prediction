chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-1265,
klein
&
co.
futures
v.
board
of
trade
of
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
days?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
days,
suppose
that
the
exchange
has
a
standard
sort
of
nondiscrimination
provision
with
respect
to
employment
practices,
and
it...
an
employee
asserts
that
she
was
discriminated
against
in
the
promotion
review.
would
she
be
covered
by
this
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
transaction
would
be
her
annual
employment
review
that
she
alleges
violated
the
exchange
rule
saying
the
exchange
would
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so...
so,
the
transaction
has
some
substantive
limitation
that
is
derived
from
where?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
aren't
these
ancillary
rules?
when
i
think
of
a
futures
exchange
market
and
the
transaction,
i
think
of
the
buyers
and
the
sellers,
you
know,
the
longs
and
the
shorts,
and
this
strikes
me
as
just
kind
of
the
paperwork
in
the
back
office.
why
is
that,
why
should
we
assume
that's
covered
by
the
term
"transaction"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
these
people...
you
mean
the
ones
in
our
hypotheticals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
concern
on
the
other
side,
i
take
it,
is
that
it's
not
just
limited
to
transactions
on
the
exchange,
but
transactions
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
contract
market.
and
i
understood
you,
in
response
to
the
hypothetical
that
justice
kennedy
posed,
that
you
indicated
that
transaction
has
some
substantive
limit
to
it,
and
if
that's
the
case,
which
seems
to
me
an
awfully
large
concession,
then
we
have
to
figure
out
what
the
limit
is.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
could
just
as
easily
be
limited
to
the
transaction
between
buyers
and
sellers
of
futures
contracts
as
between
all
these
subsidiary,
ancillary,
collateral,
whatever
transactions
that
simply
implement
that
broader
transaction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
mean
the...
the
market
is
about
investors.
it's
about
buyers
and
sellers.
now,
you're...
the
clearinghouse
and
these
fcm's
may
or
may
not
be
covered
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
it's
an
awful
big
stretch
to
say
they
are
central
to
the
market.
what's
central
to
the
market
are
the
investors.
that's
why
they
have
these.
they
wouldn't
have
this
market
for...
for
your
clients,
i
mean
for
the
clearinghouse
or
anything
else.
the
market
is
there
for
the
buyers
and
the
sellers.
that's
the
central
transaction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
days,
we'll
give
you
a
minute
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where...
where
do
all
of
those
assumptions
come
from?
i
would
have
thought
the
limitation
of
"transaction"
beyond
the
plain
language
would
be
a
significant
concession
in
this
case.
i
mean--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
we
have
to
figure
out
what
was
the
core
of
congress's
concern
and
limit
"transaction"
in
that
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
would
be
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
contract
market.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
following
you.
i
think
justice
kennedy's
question
still
applies.
your
argument
assumes
that
the
"or"
is
an
"and".
i
mean,
you
don't
need
to
have
a
transaction
"on"
at
all.
it
can
be
simply
one
subject
to
the
rules.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
fact
that
congress
put
"on"
in
there
and
then
followed
it
with
"or"
means
you
don't
have
to
worry
what
"on"
means
if
you're
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
contract
market.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
like
ejusdem
generis
argument.
you're
saying,
we
should
interpret
"subject
to
the
rules"
in
the
same
light
that
we
interpret
"transaction"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
answer
would
be
that
those
transactions
are
not
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
exchange.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
don't
care
what
kind
of
arrangement
the
fcm
might
have
with
its
bank.
that's
up
to
the
fcm.
there's
no
exchange--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
you
still
owe
justice
breyer
his
second
reason.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
mr.
days,
you
have
a
minute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
days.
the
case
is
submitted.
