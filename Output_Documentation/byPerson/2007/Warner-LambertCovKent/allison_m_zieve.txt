ms.
allison
m.
zieve
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
warner-lambert
marketed
a
defective
product.
it
withheld
information
about
the
injury
the
product
could
cause,
and
the
product
caused
injury
to
a
great
many
patients,
including
respondents.
they
sued
warner-lambert
alleging
traditional
state
law
claims,
such
as
product
defect
and
failure
to
warn.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
explaining
why
the
misrepresentation
exception
to
the
michigan
defense
does
not
implicate
the
concerns
that
were
raised
by
the
court
in
buckman.
specifically,
the
court
in
buckman
identified
three
problems
or
concerns
that
it
thought
warranted
pre-emption
in
that
case:
that
the
claim
alleged
would
cause
companies
to
submit
too
much
information
and
slow
down
the
510(k)
process;
that
the
claim
alleged
might
cause
companies
not
to
submit
products
for
approval
because
of
concern
about
off-label
use;
and
that
the
claim
would
cause
an
unwarranted
intrusion
on
the
fda's
decisionmaking
about
how
to
police
and
enforce
fraud
against
it.
so
the
question
is:
does
the
michigan
law
implicate
these
three
concerns
any
more
than
traditional
state
tort
litigation
against
a
drug
company?
i'll
start
with
what
i
think
are
the
easy
ones.
for
three
reasons,
the
michigan
statute
creates
no
incentive
for
manufacturers
to
submit
unnecessary
information
to
the
fda.
unlike
the
streamlined
510(k)
clearance
process
that
was
at
issue
in
buckman,
in
this
case
we
have
a
drug
approval.
drugs
are
required
to
go
through
a
comprehensive
pre-market
approval
process.
the
regulations
require
submission
of,
"all
available
information
about
the
safety
of
a
drug,
including
demonstrated
or
potential
adverse
effects.
"
i
was
quoting
from
314.50(b)(5).
as
warner-lambert
points
out
in
its
brief,
a
typical
new
drug
application
can
be
thousands
of
pages
long.
so
there's
not
really...
not
only
is
there
not
evidence
that
this
12-year-old
statute
will
lead
companies
to
submit
information
that
the
fda
doesn't
want
and
doesn't
need;
but
it's
really
unclear
what
such
evidence
would
be
because,
after
all,
companies
are
required
to
submit
all
safety
information
to
the
fda,
and
it's
safety
information
that
would
be
relevant
to
a
finding
under
the
michigan
exception.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
no,
your
honor.
the
discovery
in
a
case
like
this...
there
is
no
evidence
to
suggest
it
would
be
any
broader
or
more
burdensome
than
discovery
in
a
typical
product
liability
case
against
a
drug
company.
in
that
regard,
mr.
joseffer
is
wrong
that
there
was
no
discovery
in
this
case.
these
cases
are
part
of
a
multidistrict
litigation
and
there
was
a
significant
amount
of
discovery.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
i
think
i
have
a...
state
law
torts
suits
aren't
seeking
to
make
a
determination
about
whether
the
product
should
have
gone
on
the
market.
the
purpose
of
the
state
law
tort
suit
is
to
compensate
injured
patients.
that's
a
fundamentally
different
role.
it's
complementary
to
the
fda's
role,
but
it's
different.
and
i
think
your
question,
though,
really
goes
more
to
the
broader
issues
that
the
court
will
consider
next
term.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
but
that
is
not--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
this
case
doesn't
seek
to
pull
rezulin
from
the
market.
well,
first
of
all,
rezulin
was
pulled
from
the
market
seven
years
ago.
but
that
is
not
the
goal
of
this
case.
the
goal
of
this
case
is
to
pay...
to
get
compensation
for
people
who
suffered
serious
liver
damage,
every
single
one
of
them.
about
a
third
of
the
patient-respondents
died
from
the
liver
damage
caused
by
rezulin,
and
what
they're
seeking
here
is
not
a
regulatory
remedy;
they're
seeking
damages
and
compensation
for
that.
and
the...
the
place
where
we
started
with
the--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
under
michigan
law,
the
plaintiffs
can
only--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--the...
if
i
can
just
back
up
to...
to
the
structure
of
the
michigan
statute--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--i
promise
will.
[laughter]
the
michigan
statute
takes
as
its
starting
point
the
notion
that
federal
approval
is
reliable
evidence
that
a
drug
company
has
satisfied
the
duty...
state
law
duties
of
care
owed
to
patients,
and
then
it
says:
but
there
are
a
couple
of
situations
where
that
reliability
is
drawn
into
question.
so,
if
the
company
bribes
the
fda
or
the
if
the
company
misrepresented
important
information
to
the
fda,
then
the
approval
is
no
longer
a
sufficient
basis
on
which
we
can
just
say
that
approval
in
and
of
itself
means
that
the
manufacturer
satisfied
state
law
duties.
and
so,
the...
the
purpose
of
the
finding
about
whether
there
was
misrepresentation
and
what
the
results
of
it
might
have
been
is
not
to
police
enforcement
with
fda
requirements,
and
it
is
not
to
force
the
drug
off
the
market.
it
is
only
a
hurdle
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
get
past
so
it
can
litigate...
he
or
she
can
litigate
her
state
law
claim
the
same
way
plaintiffs
will
be
litigating
those
claims,
and
did
litigate
those
claims,
with
respect
to
rezulin
in
states
across
the
country.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes.
in
michigan
they
will
have
to
present
evidence
that
if
the
company
had
been
honest
with
the
fda,
the
product
wouldn't
have
been
approved.
the
discovery
in
this
case
shows
that
it
doesn't...
at
least
in
this
case,
that
wouldn't
present
a
big
problem.
first
of
all,
there
is
evidence
in
this
case,
testimony
from
the
medical
officer
who
reviewed
the
information,
that
rezulin
would
not
have
been
approved
as
a
standalone
therapy,
that
it
is
infused
without
insulin
or
another
drug,
if
the
company
hadn't
lied
about...
withheld
adverse
event
reports.
but
certainly
in
the
typical
case
a
lot
of
the
information
that
comes
out
with
respect
to
what
went
on
before
the
fda,
not
only
is
it
submitted
in
product
liability
cases
in
the
first
instance
by
the
manufacturer
to
show
all
of
the
hurdles
they
had
to
go
through
to
get
on
the
market,
doesn't
that
show
our
product
was
safe,
but
a
lot
of
it
you
can
get
in
discovery
from
the
company,
themselves,
as
happened
in
this
case.
a
lot
of--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--there
are
no
michigan
cases
explaining
just
what
you
need
to
show
to
satisfy
the
defense,
so
it
is
unclear
whether
you
have
to
show
that
you
met...
if
it
is
the
right
chemical
formula,
with
the
label
originally
approved,
or
does
compliance
with
approval
mean
that
you
also
had
to
show...
one
of
the
terms
of
approval
is
that
you
continued
to
update
your
label
when
you
become
aware
of
new
safety
information;
would
you
have
to
show...
a
manufacturer
have
to
show
that
to
show
that
the
defense
was
satisfied.
there's
no
cases
under
michigan
law
which
tell
us--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--absolutely,
we
could.
showing
that
the
exception
applies
is
just
the
first
step
to
being
able
to
litigate
this
case
the
way
plaintiffs
litigated
these
cases
in
california,
and
illinois,
and
new
york,
and
other
states.
there
was
rezulin
litigation
throughout
the
country.
and,
again,
the
point
about
discovery
is
that
the
broad
discovery
that
was
done,
a
lot
from
warner-lambert,
some
from
the
fda,
that
was
no
different
discovery
really
than
would
be
required
under
michigan.
it's
all
there.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
of
course,
in
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
it
wouldn't,
because
rezulin
is
off
the
market
and
unapproved.
but
even
as
a
general
matter
it
doesn't
affect
fda's
regulation
because,
as
i
said
in
response
to
justice
stevens,
the
effect
of
making
that
showing
and
the
jury
agreeing
that
the
product
wouldn't
have
been
approved
is...
there's
no
regulatory
effect.
the
effect
is
that
the
plaintiff
can
then
go
ahead
and
litigate
her
case
like
she
could
in
any
other
state.
and
that's
why...
that's
because
what
michigan
is
doing
is
not
policing
enforcement.
it
is
just
defining
the
parameters
of
the
compliance--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
the
parties
may
seek
discovery.
there
hasn't
been
enough
michigan
litigation
for
us
to
know
exactly
how
it
would
work;
but,
certainly,
the
courts
in
michigan
should
be
trusted
to
use
their
discretion
to
keep
discovery
under
control
as
they
do
in
every
case.
the
rezulin
litigation--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
those
are
some
of
the
background
facts
that
happened
here.
but
i
don't
think
those
are
the
facts
that
go
to
a
showing
of
what
the
fda
would
have
done
if
warner-lambert
had
made
honest
disclosures,
because
actually
those
facts
tend
to
suggest
that
the
fda
did
know
what
was
going
on.
but
later
the
second
medical
officer,
the
one
who
did
recommend
approval...
the
approval
came
in
two
stages.
one
was
for
use
as
a
combination
therapy
with
insulin
and
another
drug
called
metformin,
and
later
there
was
an
approval
for
use
of
rezulin
on
its
own.
that
is
the
use
that
happened
to
affect
all
of
my
clients,
and
that's
the
use
where
we
already
have
a
medical
officer
who
testified
that
the
agency
would
not
have
approved
for
that
use
if
the
company
hadn't
withheld
safety
information.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
deposition
testimony
from
that
medical
officer,
for
example.
there
are
e-mails.
we
cited
a
couple
of
e-mails
in
the
red
brief
of
things
that
were
stated
at
the
time:
one
an
e-mail
to
warner-lambert
and
one
from
a
medical
officer
to
his
superior
talking
about
the
way
in
which
warner-lambert
made
it
harder...
to
be
kind
to...
for
them
to
assess
what
the
true
safety
profile
of
the
drug
was.
there
is...
as
i
said,
there
was
a
very
large
amount
of
rezulin
discovery
done
in
the
mdl,
most
of
which
is
under
a
protective
order.
so
i
don't
know
everything
that's
in
there,
but--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--no
more
so
than
product
liability
litigation
in
any
other
state.
as
i
said,
the
deposition
that
happened
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff's
committee
asked...
they
negotiated
discovery
with
the
fda
in
the
rezulin
cases
in
general,
not
looking
at
michigan
specifically
at
all.
they
got
some
discovery
from
the
fda
and
the
deposition
of
the
medical
officer.
there's
also
a
lot
of
information
about
approved
drugs
that
the
fda
posts
as
a
matter
of
course
on
its
website,
including
the
medical
officer
reviews
that
form
the
basis
for
the
approval
decision.
but
even
in
other
cases,
for
instance,
the
vioxx
mdl
that
was
pending
in
louisiana,
the...
in
that
case
the
fda
wasn't
as
interested
in
negotiating,
and
there
was
motions
to
suppress
and
a
motion
to
compel.
and
the
judge
had
to
decide
whether
to
allow
an
fda
medical
officer
to
be
deposed;
and
in
that
case,
did.
there
are
other
cases
where
the
fda
has
not
wanted
discovery
and
has
successfully
opposed
it.
the
fda
has
regulations
about
that,
and
there's
no
evidence
that
it's
burdening
the
fda
to
cooperate
to
some
degree
in
discovery
or
the
judges
are
allowing
plaintiffs
to
overrun
the
fda
with
requests
they
can't
handle.
but,
more
importantly--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--i
don't
know
if
they
still
could,
but
presumably
sometime
in
the
past
they
could
have.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
the
job
the
fda
is
going
to
do,
even
if
it
agrees
with
a
plaintiff,
is
to
sanction
the
company,
perhaps,
or
to
ask
it
for
different
information.
it
does
have
the
ability
to
withdraw
approval--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--there's
no
way
for
a
plaintiff
to
compel
the
fda
to
look
into
a
situation
of
a
manufacturer
being
dishonest
for
the...
or
to...
even
if
the
fda
starts
a
process
for
a
plaintiff
to
compel
the
agency
to
make
a
finding
that
the
company
withheld
material
information,
and
we
would
not
have
approved
it
otherwise.
and
even
if
the
agency
chose
to
do
that,
it
wouldn't
be
of
any
help
to
the
plaintiff
because
the
plaintiff's
family
is
seeking
compensation
because
the
breadwinner
is
dead,
or
the
person
is
impeded
in
their
ability
to
make
a
living
in
the
future
and
has
huge
medical
bills
now.
and
the
fda's
finding
that,
yes,
the
company
really
acted
badly
isn't
going
to
do
anything
to
help
that...
that
family.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
but,
again--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--with
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
the
question,
because
if
the
jury...
if
a
michigan
jury
is
wrong
about
what
would
have
happened
if
warner-lambert
hadn't
acted
so
badly,
the
result
is
that
ms.
kent
and
the
other
plaintiffs
get
to
litigate
their
claims.
the
result
is
not...
there
is
no
regulatory--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--that
is
the
law
in
every
state.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
right.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
absolutely.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes.
the
fda
approval,
federal
approval,
and
state
tort
actions
have
co-existed
since
1938.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
right.
michigan
chose--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--to...
not
to
create
a
new
claim
as
the
plaintiffs
tried
to
do
in
buckman,
but,
rather,
to
take
a
traditional
claim
and
restrict
plaintiff's
ability
to
prevail
on
it.
this
is
not
an
expansion
of
state
tort
law.
it
is
a
considerable
narrowing
of
state
tort
law.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
and
i
would
go
even
further.
it's
not
just
pro-manufacturer.
this
statute
is
the
most
deferential
to
the
fda
of
any
state
tort
law
in
the
country.
other
states
will
allow
a
manufacturer
to
present
evidence
of
compliance
to
show
the
product
wasn't
defective,
and
that's
non-dispositive
evidence
in
almost
every
state.
and
then
a
plaintiff
can
come
back
and
say:
oh,
but
look,
they
didn't
comply
in
these
ways.
and
that
wouldn't
be
dispositive
either
in
most
states.
but
only
in
michigan
not
only
is
the
manufacturer's
compliance
defense
dispositive
in
the
majority
of
cases,
but
the
evidence
of
non-compliance
isn't
even
allowed
as
a
rebuttal
unless
the
plaintiff
can
show
that
it
actually
was
a
material
non-compliance
that
would
have
made
a
difference.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
only
to
the
extent
that
they
simply
thought
it
wasn't
relevant.
and
there
are
states
that--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--sure.
and
there
are
states
that
don't
allow
compliance--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--there
are
states
that
don't
allow
compliance
evidence
if
the
plaintiff
shows
material
misrepresentation,
"material"
being
that
it
could
have...
could
have
influenced
the
agency
without
a
finding
that
it
did
or
would
have
influenced
the
agency,
but
just
that
it
was
pertinent
information.
and
in
those
cases,
this
is
discussed
in
common...
either
the
restatement.
in
such
a
case
some
states
would
say
that
the
compliance
evidence
then
can't
come
in.
and
it
is
sort
of
the
same
theory
as
michigan's,
but
just
not
as
strict
against
the
plaintiffs,
that
if
you
can't
trust
the...
the
compliance
evidence
isn't
relevant.
it's
not
meaningful
if
you
can't
trust
it.
because
the--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--if...
if
the
traditional
tort
system
as
it
exists
in
most
every
state
is
not
pre-empted,
then
michigan's
statute
is
not
pre-empted.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
michigan
statute
is
unique
with
respect
to
the
finding...
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
finding
of
how
the
fda
would
have
acted
if
the
manufacturer
had
not
made
certain
representations.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
texas
has
a
similar
statute
except
it
doesn't
have
that
last
element.
and
one
of
the
questions
on
severability
is
whether...
if
you
think
just
that
element
is
pre-empted,
whether
you
can...
whether
michigan
would
want
to
sever
that
one
element.
and
then
there
are
a
number
of
states
that
limit
punitive
damages
liability
but
along
the
lines
of
texas,
not
michigan.
so,
again,
that
last
element
is
not
required.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
believe
it
went
into
effect
in
march
of
'96.
so,
seven
years.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
we
were
unable
to
find
any
reported
cases
or
westlaw
discussion
of--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
in
the
sixth
circuit
the
plaintiff
said:
we
can't
prove
the
exception,
but
it
is
pre-empted
and
not
severable.
so
we...
so
that
the
the
statute
would
fall.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
in
footnote
4
of
the
second
circuit's
decision,
justice
calabrezze
points
out
that
certification
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
would
also
be
an
option,
and
an
option
that
the
court
doesn't...
that
court
didn't
even
get
to.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
no,
it
wasn't.
and
this
court
has
no...
has
no
practice
with
respect
to
deferring
to
state
law
questions
that
were
decided
by
courts
of
appeals
in
a
different
case.
that
is,
this
case
didn't
come
to
the
court
from
the
sixth
circuit.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
right.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes.
it
was
a
good
try.
but
i
think
that
the
severability
argument
is
very
closely
tied
to
the
reason--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
that's
right.
i
mean,
i
think
the
fact
that
michigan
is
such
a
pro-manufacturer
state--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--that's
right.
the...
and
the
reason
for
severability,
though,
was
quite
tied
to
the
whole
reason
why
we
think
there's
not
preemption
in
the
first
place,
which
is
that
the
statute
really
needs
to
be
looked
at
as
a
whole.
you
can't...
you
can't
understand
what
the
exception
is
trying
to
accomplish
without
putting
it
in
the
context
of
the
statute.
after
all,
it
is...
it's
subparagraph
(8)
of
subsection
(5)
of
the
michigan
statute.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
