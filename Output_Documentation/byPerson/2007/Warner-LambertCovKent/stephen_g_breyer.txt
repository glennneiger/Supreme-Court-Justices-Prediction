justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
just
say
you
use
something
like
primary
jurisdiction
said
that
they
actually
have
to...
to
withdraw
it.
now,
if
the
fda...
this
is
what
justice
stevens
said
in
his
concurring
opinion,
which
i
thought
had
a
lot
to
be
said
for
it...
that
if
you
had
a
system
where
the
fda
did
withdraw
it
and
found
fraud,
you
could
ask
them,
and
then
nothing
wrong
with
the
plaintiff
going
ahead
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
any
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
makes...
makes
it
worse,
in
a
sense,
because
what
you're
saying
to
me
anyway...
and
you
can
explain
why
i'm
not
right...
that
all
of
the
three
things
that
you
mentioned
are
only
aspects
of
something
much
more
fundamental
that
underlies
all
these
cases...
medtronics,
drugs,
all
of
them.
you
came
up
and
began
and
said
this
drug
has
side
effects
that
hurt
people.
and
that's
a
risk
when
you
have
a
drug,
and
it's
a
terrible
thing
if
the
drug
hurts
people.
there's
a
risk
on
the
other
side.
there
are
people
who
are
dying
or
seriously
sick,
and
if
you
don't
get
the
drug
to
them
they
die.
so
there's
a
problem.
you've
got
to
get
drugs
to
people
and
at
the
same
time
the
drug
can't
hurt
them.
now,
who
would
you
rather
have
make
the
decision
as
to
whether
this
drug
is,
on
balance,
going
to
save
people
or,
on
balance,
going
to
hurt
people?
an
expert
agency,
on
the
one
hand,
or
12
people
pulled
randomly
for
a
jury
role
who
see
before
them
only
the
people
whom
the
drug
hurt
and
don't
see
those
who
need
the
drug
to
cure
them?
now,
that
it
seems
to
me
is
congress's
fundamental
choice,
and
congress
has
opted
for
the
agency.
and
that's
why
we're
here--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
you
want
the
jury
to
do
it.
and
it
seems
to
me,
reading
buckman,
that
buckman
says
the
agency
should
do
it.
so
that's
what
underlies
all
my
reactions
to
this,
and
i
might
as
well
get
it
right
out
so
that
you
can
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ms.
zieve,
it
doesn't
object
to
a
system
where
the...
a
court...
the
state
would
come
in
and
give
you
your
tort
suit
if
it's
really
true
that
the
agency
would
withdraw
this
drug.
but
what
you
want
is
to
be
able
to
convince
the
jury
that
there
was
fraud
in
a
situation
where
the
agency
doesn't
say
there
was
fraud.
so
what
you're
doing
is
removing
a
drug
from
the
market
that
they
want
out
there.
now,
that's
the
theory
of
buckman.
the
theory
of
buckman
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
want
to
save
people
whom
you
say
they
shouldn't
because
the
drug
shouldn't
be
there.
i
overstate
it
slightly.
so,
explain
to
me
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it
will
lead
to
the
drug
being
withdrawn,
in
which
case
there
may
be
just
as
many
people
on
the
other
side
who
are
dying,
dead,
no
breadwinner,
et
cetera,
because
they
didn't
get
a
necessary
drug.
and
that's
why
what
worries
me
is
what
happens
if
the
jury
is
wrong?
you
are
absolutely
right
when
you
say
you
cannot
make
the
fda
go
into
this
matter
and
withdraw
a
drug;
and
they
are
absolutely
right
when
they
say
we
cannot
promise
you
that
juries
will
be
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
the
question
is:
who
is
more
likely
to
be
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
think
they
should
be
able
to
litigate
a
claim
where
the
fda
has
approved
a
drug.
now,
is
that
the
law
in
most
places?
where
the
fda
has
approved
a
drug
for
use
and
the
doctor
follows
the
label
and
the
label
is
all
okay,
is
it
the
case
that
somebody
can
come
in
and
say,
despite
that,
this
drug
is
on
balance
harmful,
and
i
get
compensation?
this
is
a
serious
question.
i'm
not
sure
how
it
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
next
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
that's
where
i
am
missing
you.
why,
then,
does
michigan
even
have
this
thing?
in
other
words,
why...
you
are
saying
if
they
didn't
have
it
at
all,
you
would
go
ahead
and
bring
your
tort
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
to
me,
which
is
a
good
answer,
is
you
are
saying:
look
at
the
basic
tort
system
here.
and
if
you
can
do
that,
you
can
do
this.
is
that...
do
you
see
where
i'm--
