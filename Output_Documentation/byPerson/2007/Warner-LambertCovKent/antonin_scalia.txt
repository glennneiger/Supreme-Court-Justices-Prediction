justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
what
if
the
statute
didn't
have
that
provision,
but
it
just
said
you
can
bring
a
state
tort
action
when
the
conditions
approved
by
the
fda
for
the
marketing
of
this
drug
have
not
been
complied
with?
that's
all
it
says.
now,
would
you
knowledge
that
that...
that
that
suit
could
be
brought?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
duty
that
is
defined
by
the
fda.
and
i
didn't
hear
your
answer.
would
that
suit
be
allowable
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me...
what
i
worry
about
is
that
if
we
say
in
this
case
it
treads
too
much
into
the
fda's
own
responsibility
to
say
what
material
should
have
been
provided
to
the
fda,
it
seems
to
me
the
next
what
could
be
more
central
to
the
fda...
to
the
fda's
job
than
determining
whether
the
conditions
the
fda
prescribed
for
the
marketing
of
the
drug
have
indeed
been
observed?
that's
central
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
one
can
also
reason
in
the
opposite
direction;
that
is
to
say,
one
can
know
from
the
medical
devices
portion
of
the
fda
that
congress
has
no
objection
to
private
tort
actions
that...
where
the
medical
device
manufacturer
has
not
observed
the
requirements
that
the
fda's
approval
impose,
right?
we
know
from
that
section
that
congress
has
no
objection
to
that
there.
you
can
probably
guess
that
congress
has
no
objection
to
it
in
the...
in
the
drug
field
as
well
as
the
medical
devices
field.
and
if
i
make
that
guess,
what
is
so
different
about
having
a
jury
second-guess
the
provision
of
information
portion?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is...
it
is
more
of
a
stick
in
the
eye
of
the
federal
government
to
create
a
cause
of
action
that
consists
of
defrauding
the
federal
government,
which
is
what
was
at
issue
in
buckman.
the
very
cause
of
action
was
providing
false
information
to
the
fda.
here
the
cause
of
action
is
a
standard
tort
cause
of
action
for
marketing
a
defective
product.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
defense
itself,
which
says
that
the
defense
is
available
if
not
only
the
drug
was
approved
for
safety
and
efficacy,
but
also
if
the
drug
and
its
labeling
were
in
compliance
with
the
fda's
approval
at
the
time
the
drug
left
the
control
of
the
manufacturer?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
wrong
to
say
that
that's...
you
know,
that
that's
interfering
with
the
fda's
bailiwick?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
let
a
jury
decide
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume...
i
assume...
you
don't
stop
between
sentences,
so
i
hate
to
interrupt
you.
[laughter]
i
assume
that
if
this
drug
were
still
on
the
market,
you
could
bring
forward
the
information
that
you
have
alluded
to
about
the
withholding
of
necessary
data
by
warner-lambert,
and
the
fda
would
certainly
be
able
to
consider
that
and
decide
whether
sanctions
were
necessary,
withdrawing
of
the
drug
was
necessary.
in
this
case,
the
drug
has
already
been
withdrawn.
so
i
assume
the
fda
has
at
least
a
reduced
incentive
to
go
into
these
questions.
i
guess
they
still
would
want
to
go
into
them
if
warner-lambert
were
really
a
bad
actor.
they
could
impose
some
sanctions,
couldn't
they,
even
though
the
drug
was
already
withdrawn?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
we
could
have
two
different
rules:
one
for
drugs
that
are
still
out
there
and
one
for
drugs
that
have
since
been
withdrawn?
because
i
frankly
see
little
incentive
for
the
fda,
you
know,
to
go
back
over
past
mistakes.
the
drug
now
having
been
withdrawn,
it
doesn't
matter.
but
if
the
drug
was
still
out
there,
it
seems
to
me
you
could
come
forward,
and
i
would
be
much
less
sympathetic
to
what
you're
trying
to
do.
you
could
trust
the
fda
to
do
the
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
once
it
sanctions
the
plaintiff,
the
government
can't
make
the
argument
you
are
interfering;
you
are
second-guessing
the
fda.
the
fda
would
have
said:
you
didn't
give
us
information
that
was
necessary;
and
had
we
known
this,
we
wouldn't
have
gone
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
sixth
circuit
case?
it
must
have
involved
this,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
what
is
your
position
on
severability?
why
shouldn't
we...
you
know,
we
usually
accept
the
circuit
court's
determination
as
to
what
the
state
law
is.
michigan
is
in
the
sixth
circuit.
and
i
think
it's
overwhelmingly
likely
that
the
second
circuit
would
defer
to
the
sixth
circuit's
view.
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
unless
they
choose
not
to
change
their
mind.
i
mean,
they
did
say
that
they're
bound
by
this
by
garcia
as
to
questions
of
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
said
that:
we
are
bound
by
garcia
as
to
questions
of
state
law.
