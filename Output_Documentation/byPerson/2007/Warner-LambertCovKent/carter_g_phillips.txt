mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
six
years
ago,
this
court
in
buckman
recognized
that
policing
fraud
against
federal
agencies
is
hardly
a
field
the
states
have
traditionally
occupied.
based
on
that
premise,
this
court
in
buckman
struck
down
a
novel
state
tort
that
was
based
on
the
whole
concept
of
fraud
on
the
fda.
and
the
court
concluded
that
that
tortious
analysis
as
a
matter
of
state
law
would
inevitably
conflict
with
the
fda's
responsibility
to
police
fraud.
a
responsibility
that
the
court
recognized
was
essentially
cradle
to
grave
covered
by
federal
law.
it
arises
out
of
federal
law,
it
is
regulated
by
federal
law
and
it
is
ultimately
terminated
by
federal
law.
michigan
has
adopted
a
unique
product
liability
statute,
and
on
the
one
hand
confers
a
very
broad
immunity
of
defense
against
all
product
liability
claims
for
manufacturers
who
comply
with
the
fda's
requirements.
but
then
on
the
other
hand,
withdraws
that
immunity
for
the
defense,
this
is
pda
app.
42a,
if
the
manufacturer
intentionally
withholds
from
or
misrepresents
to
the
united
states
food
and
drug
administration
information
concerning
the
drug
that
is
required
to
be
submitted
pursuant
to...
and
then
it
goes
and
lists
very
specific
provisions
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act...
and
the
drug
would
not
have
been
approved
or
the
food
and
drug
administration
would
have
withdrawn
approval.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
a
statute
that
would
more
consciously
and
openly
tread
into
exactly
the
same
territory
that
this
court
declared
in
buckman
as
a
matter
of
exclusive
federal
and
concern
not
available
to
the
states
to
regulate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
will
acknowledge
that's
a
fundamentally
different
issue,
justice
scalia,
because
there
you
are
talking
about
what
duties
are
owed
to
the
public
that
are
enforced
by
the
fda
and
potentially
are
enforceable
by
the
states
as
well.
but
here
we're
talking
about
duties
that
are
owed
from
the
manufacturer
exclusively--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
suit
would
not
be
barred,
i
don't
think,
by
buckman.
i
think
the
question
there
will
really
go
to
what
the
court
is
going
to
decide
next
term
in
wyeth
as
to
how
far
when
if
you
have
fda
approval
of
certain
activities
that
that
has
the
effect
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
think
it
is
an
unreasonable
next
step,
but
it
is
clearly
the
next
step
that
has
to
be
taken.
because
what
this
court
decided
in
buckman...
and
it's
central
and
candidly
we
are
here
seeking
a
very
narrow
ruling
from
the
court
is
that
when
you're
defining
the
relationship
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
seller
of
the
drugs
and
the
fda
in
terms
of
the
disclosure
of
information
to
that
entity
and
the
determination
both
whether
that
information
is
adequate
to
allow
the
agency
to
perform
its
business
and
then,
more
fundamentally,
whether
or
not
the
agency
is
acting
in
accordance
with
its
own
exclusive
authority
to
decide
how
to
proceed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
argument
you
just
made,
justice
scalia,
would
have
led
the
court
to
the
opposite
result
in
buckman,
because
what's
the...
you
know,
if
congress
didn't
care
about
allowing
state
tort
law
to
be...
to
serve
as
the
enforcement
mechanism,
then
why
wouldn't
you
allow
them
to
do
that
in
that
context
as
well?
and
this
court
said
the
reason
is
because
there
is
a
very
uniquely
federal
interest
in
taking
care
of
the
business
and
the
relationship
between
those
two
entities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
when
you
say
"here"
what
we're
talking...
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
very
unique
state
statute
that
is
the
sole
basis
on
which
the
tort
liability
is
set
aside.
we're
not...
we're
not
pre-empting
the
underlying
tort
claims
by
the
federal
law
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
state
statute
pre-empts
the
common
law
court
claims.
that
first
portion
of
the
defense
wipes
those
out.
so
it's
not
pre-emption
of
the
traditional
state
law
cause
of
action,
as
the
second
circuit
wrongly
evaluated
it.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
provision
that
in
the
most
exquisite
terms
says:
allow
the
state,
either
by
the
court
or
the
juries,
to
evaluate
the
adequacy
of
the
information
that
the
fda
required.
and
it's
important
to
understand
how
that
plays
out,
because
what
it
says
is
pursuant
to
those
statutes.
it
specifically
identifies
provisions
in
the
statutes.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
how
the
fda...
how
the
fda
interprets
those
statutes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
what
you're
basically
arguing
for
is
an
argument
i
think
one
of
the
amici
made
on
the
other
side,
which
is:
does
the
greater
power
include
the
lesser
power?
that
is,
if
we
had
the
authority
not
to
give
you
a
defense
in
the
first
place,
don't
we
have
the
authority
to
use
this
as
a
lever
in
order
to
allow
us
essentially
to
undertake
to
regulate
in
precisely
the
same
way
the
fda
would?
and
the
answer
is:
no,
because
this
is
not
a
situation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
it
is
an
unconstitutional
condition.
but
i
think
the
bottom
line
is
it's
not
a
question
of
us
taking
the
bad
with
the
good.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
federal
government
has
an
independent
interest,
and
it
is
the
federal
government's
independent
interest
that
is
being
essentially
wiped
away.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
that's
clearly
a
question
of
state
law.
i
mean,
that's
a
severability
issue
to
be
sure.
and
i...
but
i
think
it's
not
fair
to
condemn
the
way
the
sixth
circuit
analyzed
this
case.
what
the
sixth
circuit
said
is
if
it's
still
available
to
the
state
to
come
in
after
the
fda
has
both
found
that
there
has
been
a
material
deception
of
one
sort
or
another
and
that
the
fda
has
decided
to
withdraw
the
product
as
a
consequence
of
that,
and
that...
and
then
state
law
is
allowed
to
come
in
and
enforce
product
liability
claims
under
those
circumstances,
that
the
legislature
would
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
with
that
arrangement.
and,
candidly,
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
asked
for
before
both
the
second
circuit
and
this
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
question
goes
to
how
far
that
response
goes.
if
you
in
fact
instructed,
if
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
if
it
found,
and
then
just
quoted
the
language
of
the
statute
that
there's
no,
then
i'd
say,
yes,
that
is
pre-empted
in
precisely
the
same
way.
and
the
language
the
court
used
in
buckman
was
"critical
element".
if
the
fda's
regulatory
authority
is
a
critical
element
of
the
case,
then,
yes,
it
is
pre-empted.
whether
or
not...
whether
evidence
by
itself
would
be
a
critical
element
is
harder
to
tell.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
the
government
is
probably
in
a
better
position
to
evaluate
that
than
i
am.
but,
you
know--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
what
the
court
said
in
buckman
about
that
probably
applies
equally
here,
which
is
that,
rather
than
look
to
see
whether
there
is,
in
fact,
going
to
be
an
interference,
we
ought
to
recognize
that
this
is
a
territory
that
is
locked
off
exclusively
to
the
federal
government's
control,
and
we
shouldn't...
and
there
shouldn't
be
that
external
pull,
the
extraneous
pull,
that
state
law
provides
under
these
circumstances.
and
the
same
logic
obviously
applied
here
would
say:
we
don't
wait
until
there's
a
serious
interference
with
how
the
fda
is
trying
to
do
its
job;
we
try
to
prevent
that
because
there's
no...
there's
no
legitimate
state
interest
to
be
served
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
the
bribery
statute,
because
again
that
doesn't
go
to
the
direct
relationship
between
the
manufacturer
or
the
seller
or
the
regulated
entity
and
the
fda
itself.
that
goes
to
the
relationship
between...
that...
that
is
governed
by
a
different
set
of
laws.
and
i
think
it's
traditionally
been
the
case
that
states
are
in
fact
entitled
to
enforce
laws
against
bribery
of
federal
officials.
so
i
don't
think
the
same...
as
i
say,
what
i'm
looking
for
here
is
an
extremely
narrow
ruling
from
this
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
when
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i'm
not
going
to
let
a
jury
decide
that.
[laughter]
what
the
district
court
found
here,
obviously,
was
that
there
was
compliance,
because
the
other
side
didn't
challenge
the
compliance.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and,
candidly,
i
think
that
is
going
to
happen
99.999
percent
of
the
time,
because
that's
not
going
to
be
the
issue.
but,
you
know,
could
it
eventually
be
a
problem
if
a
state
jury...
if
a
state
court
were
to
decide
that
there
hasn't
been
compliance?
it
seems
to
me
that's
much
closer,
again,
to
what
you're
going
to
take
up
again
next
term
in
wyeth.
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
issue,
but
it's
a
very
different
one
from
the
question
of
how
do
you
regulate
the
relationship
between
a...
the
regulated
entity
and
the
fda
in
terms
of
the
information
flow
that
goes
between
those
two
entities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
even
if
there
is
no
pre-emption
on...
on
the...
well,
i
hope
i
win
this
case
regardless.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
well...
you
mean
i
would
have
won
this
case
on
the
merits
of
it?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
clearly
we
know
that
the
fda
didn't
withdrew
this
as
a
consequence
of
fraud.
so
in
that
sense,
i
suppose
you're
right,
but...
but
the
reality
is
that
the
more
fundamental
problem
remains,
whether
or
not
these
kinds
of
statutes
are
still
out
there,
are
going
to
create
this...
as
the
court
said...
extraneous
pull.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
don't
have
any
problem
with
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
we
were
very--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
the
court
wanted
to
go
that
way,
that's
fine.
i
don't
think
it's
presented
in
this
case,
but
that
wouldn't
present
any
problem
for
us.
i
think
what
we...
what
we
have
here
is
the
second
circuit
is
wrong,
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
hopefully,
i'll
give
you
back
some
of
that
time,
so
you
can
get
to
lunch.
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
best
case
for
us
without
buckman
would
have
been
hoyle
versus
united
technologies.
that's
a
case
involving
again
a
uniquely
federal
interest.
and
the
advantage
of
that
particular
case
is
it
also
reflects
that
pre-emption
is
not
an
all
or
nothing
proposition.
you
can
preempt
out
the
specific
parts
that
is
offensive
and
retain
the
part
of
state
law
that
is
not
offensive.
and
that's
precisely
what
we're
trying
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
that's
what
made
it
a
uniquely
federal
interest.
but
i
don't
know
that
it's
any
more
a
uniquely
federal
interest
than
this
one.
at
least
this
is
the
way
the
court
has
analyzed
both
of
them
in
buckman.
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect
to
severability,
i
think,
frankly,
the
second
circuit
already
answered
the
question.
they
said
that
we
would
defer
to
the
sixth
circuit
under
factors
and
then
analyze
certification.
and
it
concluded
that,
given
the
clarity
of
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
garcia,
that
there's
nothing
left
to
be
decided
on
that
issue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
you...
if
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
would
suggest
you
read
the
petition
appendix
14a,
where
it
says
on
the
one
hand,
under
factors
we
are
bound
to
follow
garcia's
conclusions
as
to
questions
of
michigan
state
law,
and
then
the
footnote
reflects
that
the
sixth
circuit
in
garcia
had
clearly
decided
the
severability
issue
here.
so,
frankly,
if--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
spoke
specifically
to
the
issue
and
recognized
the
right
outcome.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
but
there
is
a
discussion
of
that
in
the
sixth
circuit
decision.
garcia
specifically
deals
with
that,
because
it
says
the
bitter
that
you
have
to
take
is
if
the
fda
in
fact
makes
all
of
the
very
specific
and
intricate
findings
that
are
required
by
the
exception
and
concludes
that
the
product
should
be
withdrawn
for
fraud,
then
in
fact
you
get
the
bitter,
which
is
that
the
lawsuit
goes
forward
under
those
circumstances,
and
that
that's
the
reasonable
compromise
that
the
state
legislature
had
in
mind
or
would
have
been
satisfied
with.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
all
i'm
saying
is
i
think
the
court
addressed
that
in
garcia
and
specifically
concluded
that
the
legislature
in
fact
would
have
passed
that;
and
that
traditionally,
the
second
circuit
would
defer,
as
would
this
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
clearly
it's
not
foreclosed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
justice
scalia,
i'd
like
to
answer
your
question
about
if
we
were
going
forward
with
respect
to
withdrawal
as
opposed
to
looking
back.
i
mean,
the
fda
still
has
the
authority
to
order
disgorgement,
to
order
restitution
for
victims.
i
think
the
notion
that
the
fda
is
indifferent
to
claims
of
fraud
is
just...
is
flatly
offensive.
the
reality
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
whatever
injuries...
yeah,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
sweep
of
restitution
would
be,
but
disgorgement
of
profits
would
certainly
provide
a
mechanism
for
providing--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
understand
that.
all
i'm
suggesting,
justice
stevens,
is
that
there
are
remedial
mechanisms
still
available
to
the
fda
if
in
fact
it
concluded
that
there
was
some
problem,
and
that
those--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
as
i
understood
the
fda's
position
is
that
they
have
pretty
broad
remedial
authority
and
that
it
extends
to
some
form
of
restitution
to
the
victims.
so
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
there
is
a
provision
for
citizen
petitions
that
exists,
that's
cited.
so,
yes,
there
is
a
mechanism.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no.
it
entertains
it.
in
point
of
fact,
there
was
a
petition
filed
by
public
citizen
to
withdraw
rezulin
in
this
specific
case,
and
it
was
reviewed
and
it
was
rejected
for
exactly
the
reason
justice
breyer
identified,
because
if
you
took
it
off
the
market,
people
would
die.
that
was
the
concern
that
drove
the
fda
to
say:
we're
not
going
to
do
that
under
these
circumstances.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honors.
