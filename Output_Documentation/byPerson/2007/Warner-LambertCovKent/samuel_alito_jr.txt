justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
explain
why
you
think
mr.
joseffer
was
wrong
when
he
argued
that
having
a
jury
decide
whether
the
fda
would
have
approved
the
drug
or
would
have
withdrawn
it
from
the
market
if
additional
or
different
information
had
been
supplied
is
incorrect?
doesn't
that...
wouldn't
that
very
seriously
interfere
with
what
the
fda
is
doing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
wouldn't
be
discovery
of
internal
processes
within
the
fda?
there
wouldn't
be
experts
testifying
about
what
the
fda
would
or
would
not
have
done?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
evidence
would
you
introduce
to
prove
the...
to
prove
the
exception
if
the
second
circuit's
decision
stands?
