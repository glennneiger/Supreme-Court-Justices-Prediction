justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
will
hear
argument
in
warner-lambert
against
kimberly
kent.
mr.
phillips,
whenever
you're
ready
we
will
be
happy
to
hear
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
may
i
ask
this
question
that's
related
to
justice
ginsburg's,
but
not
the
same.
you
are
saying
that
the
defense
is
not
pre-empted;
the
response
to
the
defense
is
what
is
pre-empted
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
didn't
have
a
statute
at
all
and
you
just
had
a
common
law
lawsuit
in
which
you
defended
on
the
ground
of
compliance
with
the
federal
statute
shows,
the
federal
program,
shows
a
lack
of
negligence.
and
then
it
then
came
back
with
the
rebuttal:
yes,
but
your
compliance
was
tainted
by
fraud,
the
same
kind
of
thing.
would
that
response
be
pre-empted
in
a
common
law
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
finish
with
one
other
thought
before--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
one
of
your
arguments
and
the
government's
argument,
this
is
very
burdensome
to
the
fda
because
we
have
all
this
litigation.
in
all
the
years
we
have
had
this
kind
of
tort
litigation,
has
this
issue
ever
proved
to
be
burdensome
to
the
government
in
any
of
these...
these
attempts
to
make
out
this
charge
and
this
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
three
or
four
states
that
have
these
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
most
states
don't
have
these
statutes.
i
wonder
if
the
problem
is
really
as
serious
as
everybody--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
there
can
also
be
the
same
argument
for
pre-empting
the
section,
the
subpart
(b)
of
michigan
statute,
the
bribery
exception?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
what
you
are
saying
is:
we're
going
to
win
this
case
even
if
there
were
no
pre-emption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
have
such
a
burden
of
proving
that
the
drug
wouldn't,
in
fact,
have
been
withdrawn
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
joseffer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
sort
of
general
question?
apart
from
buckman
itself,
which
describes
a
very
serious
theoretical
problem,
as
i
understand
it,
there
must
have
been
a
fair
amount
of
litigation
over
the
years
where
the
regulatory
compliance
defense
was
raised
or
challenged
or
so
forth.
is
there...
are
there
any
reported
cases
describing
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
to
the
government,
when
the...
as
the
result
of
debate
about
these
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
whole
theoretical
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
litigation
is
not,
not
new.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
would
you...
is
the
bribery
exception
also
pre-empted,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
do
you
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--supposing
the...
supposing
the
official
pleaded
guilty
to
bribery.
would
it
be
pre-empted
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
we've
got
a
lot
of
theoretical
litigation
out
here
without
much
actual
experience
with
any
of
these
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
zieve.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
prove
that
the...
an
exception
to
the
defense
applies
and
still
lose
your
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
something.
in
the
other
case,
the
plaintiff
is
the
one
who
argued
there
was
pre-emption,
and
the
whole
statute
was
invalid,
and
not
the
defendant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
i
missed
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
defendants
kind
of
take
the
risk
when
they
make
the
argument
they
are
making.
they
have
a
chance
to
either
lose
or
win.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
is
no
severability,
the
defense
is
gone,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
five
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
restitution
for
victims
include
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
not
talking
about
profits
when
you
have
an
injured...
a
patient
who
died
as
a
result
of
malpractice
or
something.
that's
not
disgorgement
of
profits.
that's
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
couldn't
give
recovery
to
a
class
action
of
a
couple
of
hundred
plaintiffs
who
were
injured,
could
it?
no
such
remedy
under
the
fda,
or
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
is
taken
under
advisement.
