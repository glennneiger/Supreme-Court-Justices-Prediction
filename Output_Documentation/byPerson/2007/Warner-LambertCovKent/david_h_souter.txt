justice
david
h.
souter
does
your
argument
carry
to
the
point
of
the
same
argument
when
regulatory
compliance
is
raised
as
a
defense,
or
regulatory
violation
is
raised
as
a
ground
for
liability?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
whenever
you...
whenever
you
raise
fda
compliance,
there
is
at
least
the
potential
for
a
response
that
they...
they
defrauded
the
fda;
they
didn't
tell
them
what
they
should
have,
and...
you
know,
vice
versa,
when...
when
it's
raised
on
the
other
side.
so
you
always
have
the
potential
there
for...
for
just
what
concerns
you,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
the
withdrawal
element,
withdrawal
of
approval
that
kills
it
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
get
beyond
the
element
of
what
the
fda
would
have
done
if
it
had
known,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
get
into
an
issue
which
is
likely
to
arise
by...
whenever,
by
one
side
or
the
other,
the
question
of
regulatory
approval
is...
is
offered
as
a
mere
matter
of
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
what
you've
got
here,
except
that
the
mere
admissibility
of
the
evidence
turns
in
part
on
what
the...
the
fda
would
have
done.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
essentially...
i
mean
you...
the
fact
is
the
evidence
of
the
fda
approval
is
made
admissible
and
conclusive,
and
whether
that
in
fact
may
be
admitted
is
subject
to
the...
what
is
it...
clause
(b)
that
you
object
to,
but
it
comes
down
to
a
question
of
admissibility.
