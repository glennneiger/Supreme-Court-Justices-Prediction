justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
isn't...
isn't
the
standard...
in
the
standard
tort
claim,
no
michigan
statute,
but
a
defense
that's
available
to
a
drug
manufacturer
who
is
charged
with
putting
on
the
market
a
defective
drug,
its
regulatory
compliance,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
the
state
of
michigan
has
said:
drug
dealers...
i'm
sorry...
drug
sellers...--
[laughter]
--drug
manufacturers,
we
are
going
to
give
you
an
invigorated
defense.
instead
of
just
saying
you
show
regulatory
compliance,
we're
going
to
take
you
off
the
hook
altogether,
except
if
you
didn't
come
clean
with
the
fda,
if
you
withheld
information
or
misrepresented
information.
it
seems
to
me
that
what...
you
could
say
this
is
just
like
buckman,
but
you
could
also
say
this
is
giving
the
manufacturer
an
invigorated
regulatory
compliance
defense.
so
why
shouldn't
it
be
looked
at
as
the
second,
rather
than
the
first?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you're
right
in
your
argument,
the
michigan
statute
provided
two
things:
one
good
for
the
manufacturer,
immunity;
two,
a
qualification
on
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
those
two
can't
be
unstuck.
so
to
strike
out
one,
as
was
done
in
the
sixth
circuit
case,
and
not
the
other
is
certainly
not
faithful
to
the
michigan
legislature
that
put
these
two
things
together.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
joseffer,
let's
assume
that...
that
you're
right.
the
second
circuit,
because
it
thought
your
position
it
was
wrong,
never
got
to
the
severance
question.
it
had
been
decided
by
some
intermediate
appellate
court.
but
would
it
not
be
appropriate
then
to
leave
it
to
the
second
circuit
on
remand,
if
it
chooses
to
use
the
michigan
certification
process
to
say,
well,
we
want
to
find
out
from
the
michigan
supreme
court
whether
they
think
that
the
sweet
stays,
but
the
bitter
goes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't...
in
this
case
one
of
the
charges
was
that
the
original
fda
examiner
had
recommended
against
approval
for
this
drug,
and
then
something
happened
inside
the
fda,
and
that
examiner
was
taken
off
the
matter,
and
another
one
who
approved
it
was
put
on?
isn't
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
fda
would
want
to
police
itself
and
not
have
state
courts
look
into?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is:
would
we
be
disrupting
the
fda
by
taking
depositions
of
examiners
to
find
out
what
went
on
at
the
fda?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
been
contested,
and
we
are
going
to
hear
that
case
next
term.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
but
it's
been--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--at
least
since
the
1930's,
state
tort
litigation
of
the
very
kind
that
justice
breyer
has
described
has
gone
on.
isn't
that
so?
that
you...
even
though
the
fda
has
approved
a
drug,
an
injured
party
can
say
this
was
a
defective
drug,
and
the
manufacturer
says
regulatory
compliance.
that's
a
defense.
and
you
would
say
it's
a
defense,
but
not
a
conclusive
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
how...
that's
how--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
would
you
say
that
my
characterization
of
it
when
mr.
phillips
was
presenting
his
case,
that
this
is
an
invigorated
regulatory
compliance
defense,
that
it
is
more
favorable,
far
more
favorable,
to
the
manufacturer
than
the
standard
regulatory
compliance
because
it
says
that
the
manufacturer
is
immune,
totally
immune,
unless...
and
then
the
exception
that
we
are
debating
here.
but
it
is
a
deliberately
pro-manufacturer
measure.
it
gives
the
manufacturer
an
immunity
that
the
regulatory
compliance
defense
does
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
zieve,
how
many
states
have
a
statute
like
michigan's?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
other
state
does
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
was
there
any
experience
with
this
in
michigan?
how
many
years
was
it
in
operation
before
the
sixth
circuit
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
there
been
many
trials
to
test
this
theory
that
it
would
be
disruptive,
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
discussion
in
the
sixth
circuit
was
not
very
extensive
on
this
point,
on
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
didn't
think
that
the
second
circuit
discussed
severability,
but
i
can
go
back
and
check.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
it
had
been
raised
there,
but
they
didn't
get
to
it
because
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
a
very,
very
quick...
it
isn't
a
very
thoroughly
reasoned
discussion.
it's
a
is
very...
it's
just
one
paragraph.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
because
it
is
odd...
i
mean,
it
is
odd
that
you'd
have
a
statute
that
says:
manufacturer,
we're
going
to
give
you
immunity,
but
there's
an
exception.
they
seem
so
tied
together
and
it
really
would
be
a
case
of
letting
one
side
keep
the
sweet
and
get
rid
of
the
bitter.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is...
that
there
was
no
discussion
of
that
in
the
sixth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
is
whether
the
legislature
would
have
passed
the
statute
that
it
did
if
in
a
case
like
this
one
the
manufacturer
could
have
the
immunity
without
the
exception.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be...
it
would
be
open
to
the
second
circuit
on
remand
because
it's
not
foreclosed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
told
us
in
its
brief
that
the
fda
has
no
system
for
addressing
public
complaints...
this
was
in
their
brief
at
page
24...
because
that
would
divert
attention
from
their
primary
mission.
so
there's
no
action
for
fraud
that
one
can
bring
to
the
fda.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
fda
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
about
it?
