justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
arguing
an
unconstitutional
condition,
in
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
leaving
aside
buckman,
what's
your
strongest
case
in
support
of
your
position?
besides
that
it
is
a
new
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this...
this
tracks
somewhat
justice
stevens'
question.
do
we
know
in
this
case,
would
this
have
taken
two
or
three
days
of
testimony?
was
there
discovery?
was
it
a
thousand
documents?
or
three
documents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
converse
of
that
is
that
the
discovery
is
exhaustive
and
quite
burdensome.
i
mean,
you're
trying
to
say,
well,
don't
worry;
there's
thousands
of
documents
here;
they
won't
be
submitting
anything
else.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
that
cuts
against
you
when
we're
talking
about
the
intrusiveness
on
the
federal
scheme
because
you
have
to
have
federal
regulators
go
back
through
all
of
this
stuff
again.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
premise
still
is,
is
that
the
drug
should
not
have
been
marketed,
or
is
that
your
premise?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
your
purpose
is
different,
but
the
premise
on
which
you
operate
is
that
the
drug
should
not
have
been
sold.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
back
up
as
long
as
you
want
as
long
as
you
come
forward
and
answer.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
aren't
you
going
to
tell
this
jury
that
the
drug
should
not
have
been
on
the
market?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
under
the
michigan
scheme
you
don't
have
to
show
that.
you
just
show
approval,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case
in
michigan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
your
view
could
a
state
prohibit
introduction
of
evidence
by
the
defendant
that
the
drug
was
approved
by
the
fda?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
all
they
say
in
the
statute:
we
just
think...
they
just
think
this
is
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
don't
think
that's
consistent
with
your
position.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
was
special
consideration
because
of
military
considerations.
