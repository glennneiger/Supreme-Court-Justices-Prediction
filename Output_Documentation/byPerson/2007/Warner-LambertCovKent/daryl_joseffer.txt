mr.
daryl
joseffer
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
michigan
statute
presents
the
same
conflict
this
court
found
in
buckman,
because
it
requires
the
determination
of
fraud
on
the
fda
as
a
necessary
predicate
for
establishing
liability.
and
as
this
court
explained
in
buckman,
the
relationship
between
a
federal
agency
and
the
entities
it
regulates
is
inherently
federal.
and
that's--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--it
could
depend,
because
in
our
view
what's
pre-empted
here
is
a
state
court
determination...
under
buckman,
what's
pre-empted
is
a
state
court
determination
of
whether
the
fda
was
defrauded
as
part
of
fda's
approval
process.
so,
for
example,
under
any
circumstance,
if
a
jury
is
being
instructed
to
find
whether
fda
was
defrauded
as
part
of
the
approval
process,
we'd
say
there's
pre-emption.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well...
and
what
we
would
say
is
not
pre-empted...
i
mean,
it's
hard
to
analyze
this
in
the
abstract
without
a
record
as
to
what
a
jury
was
actually
being
asked
to
do.
but
if
you
had
a
situation
where
it
was,
say,
a
design
defect
claim,
and
the
jury
was
being
asked
to
decide
whether
this
design
is
defective,
and
that's
what
it's
looking
at,
and
in
connection
with
that
the
jury
is
instructed
that
two
relevant
things
it
can
consider
are,
first,
the
fact
of
fda's
approval
determination
and,
second,
the
circumstances
surrounding
that
approval
determination,
then
that
by
itself,
we
would
say,
is
not
pre-empted
by
buckman,
really
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
pre-emption
normally
applies
to
legal
theories,
such
as
claims
or
defenses,
not
the
mere
admissibility
of
evidence;
and
the
second
is
that
fda's
core
prerogatives
here,
as
the
administrator
of
its
own
drug
approval
process,
are
to
determine
whether
it
has
been
defrauded
and
what
to
do
about
that.
and
if
the
jury
is
not
being
asked
to
find
those
things,
but
instead
is
just
considering
evidence
in
connection
with
something
else,
we
would
say
that
that
is
what's
not
pre-empted.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
that's
part
of
it
but
not
all
of
it.
i
mean,
in
our
view,
fda,
as
the
administrator
of
its
own
approval
process,
needs
absolute
discretion
to
determine
what
must
be
submitted
to
it
as
part
of
its
own
approval
process,
whether
it
is
misled
as
part
of
its
own
approval
process;
whether
as
you
said
it
would
have
made
a
different
determination
in
the
absence
of
any
fraud.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
if
it
really
is
a
mere
matter
of
evidence,
and
that's
not
what
the
jury
is
be
asked
to
find...
and
by
the
way,
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
there's...
that
there's...
it's
settled
common
law
tradition
in
this
type
of
litigation,
because
the
context
here,
where
a
federal
agency
does
a
product-specific
approval
based
in
part
on
a
submission
of
information
from
a
manufacturer,
that's
not
a...
that's
a
question
that,
first,
is
of
relatively
modern
vintage
and,
second,
is
not
terribly
common.
so
there's
not
really
a
uniform,
deeply
rooted
common
law
tradition
here.
but
if
all
we
were
talking
about
was
the
mere
admissibility
of
evidence,
we
would
agree
that
that
was
not
pre-empted.
but
if
you
look
at--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
no--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
it's
not
because
the
statute
expressly
requires,
as
a
predicate
for
liability,
a
finding
that
the
information
disclosure
requirements
of
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
were
violated.
the
jury
has
to
find
what
was
required
to
be
submitted
to
fda,
was
it
submitted
to
fda
and
was
fda
misled?
and
if
you
had
a
state
administrative
agency
that
was
set
up
to
tell
companies
what
they
must
or
must
not
submit
to
fda,
as
part
of
fda's
own
approval
process,
the
conflict
with
fda's
ability
to
administer
its
own
approval
process
would
be
manifest.
and
it's
no
different...
as
in
regal,
the
juries
instead
of
agencies
would
be
making
those
determinations
in
individual
cases.
and
if
i
could
illustrate
the
concern
which
this
court
explained
in
buckman,
it's
that...
just
two
fda
regulations.
the
first
explains
that
the
technical
section
of
a
new
drug
application
must
provide
information
and
data
in
sufficient
detail
to
permit
the
agency
to
make
a
knowledgeable
judgment.
now,
because
that
is
an
extremely
subjective
standard,
another
fda
regulation...
and
by
the
way,
these
are
on
pages
142a
and
186a
of
the
petition
appendix...
the
second
goes
on
to
explain
that
the
type
and
quantity
of
information
that
must
be
submitted
to
fda
necessarily
depends
on
the
particular
drug.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
nothing
that...
that
that's
beyond
the--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
it's
also
a
relatively
new
problem,
and
what...
because...
because
it's--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right,
but
the
product-specific
approvals,
and
the
desire
to
probe
into
the
circumstances
surrounding
a
product-specific
approval,
is
of
relatively
modern
vintage.
and
buckman
itself
stands
for
the
proposition
that
that
was
not
a
traditional
state
inquiry
at
that
time.
and
buckman
certainly
has
not
encouraged
a
significant
increase
in
such
litigation
since
then.
so
this
is
something
that
there's
not
been
a
whole
lot
of.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
it
is.
it's
a
novel
type
of
situation
where
you're...
where
you're
talking
about
the
federal
government's
prerogatives
to
administer
its
own
approval
processes.
there
hasn't
been
a
lot
of
state
court
litigation
on
this,
in
part
because
it's
so
obviously
a
federal
matter.
i
mean,
if
a
state
supreme
court
wanted
to
tell
litigants,
private
litigants
before
this
court
what
they
could
and
couldn't
say
in
their
briefs
to
this
court,
the
conflict
would
be
obvious
and
therefore
the
state
supreme
court
would
never
do
it.
and
you
have
a
similar
problem
here
where
the
state
is
essentially
telling
companies
what
they
must
or
must
not
be
telling
fda,
and
there's
just
an
obvious
intrusion
there
with
fda's
ability
to
administer
its
own
approval
process.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
and,
i
mean,
as
you
know,
we
don't
have
a
position
on
the
state
law
severability
question,
because
our
concern
here
is
protecting
fda's
prerogative
to
administer
its
own
process,
not
with
whether
the
plaintiff
or
defendant
ultimately
wins.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
it
was.
and
one
of
the
things
that
that
brings
up,
in
the
sixth
circuit
it
was
actually
the
plaintiff
who
was
advocating
federal
pre-emption
there,
because
she
thought
that
she
would
then
win
on
severability
analysis
and
would
thereby
knock
out
the
entire
state
statute.
what
that
underscores
is
that
the
unusual
federal
pre-emption
question
here
is
not
necessarily
one
that
is
even
bad
for
plaintiffs.
it
just
protects
the
important
federal
prerogative
of
fda's
ability
to
administer
its
own
drug
approval
process.
but...
but
to
answer
your
question,
i
mean,
we
don't
have
a
question...
a
position
on
that
analysis,
but
i
mean,
among
the
procedural
options
that
are
available,
as
you
said,
i
mean,
you're
right.
michigan
does
have
a
state
certification
process
that,
if
people
thought
appropriate,
could
be
used.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
i
mean,
this
case
was
resolved
promptly
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
but
if
you
were
going
to
seriously
litigate
the
question,
you
would
have
to
know...
in
order
to
put
this
in
context,
to
determine
things
like
withholding
and
materiality...
you'd
have
to
know
everything
that
fda
had
before
it,
what
fda
thought
was
required
as
part
of
that
process.
you
would
then
have
to,
i
suppose,
depose
fda
witnesses
as
to
what
they
would
have
found
to
be
misleading
and
what
decisions
they
might
have
made
in
hypothetical
circumstances.
and
those
are
incredibly
intrusive
inquiries
that,
one,
distort
manufacturers'
incentives
in
dealing
with
fda
in
the
first
place;
two,
if
this
was
seriously
going
to
be
litigated
would
require,
i
assume,
quite
a
lot
of
discovery
from
fda,
which
we
would
resist,
but
that's
not
to
say
that
we
would
necessarily
succeed
in
our
objections.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
that's
a...
there's
a
very
different
analysis
there.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
but
we
do
think
that
that
would
be
pre-empted
because...
for
a
slightly
different
reason,
which
is
that
the
relationship
between...
the
bribery
of
a
federal
official
in
connection
with
his
federal
duties
is
obviously
a
matter
of
paramount
federal
concern,
and
when
the...
especially
when
the
state
is
looking
at
that
for
purposes
of
essentially
second-guessing
the
validity
of
a
regulatory
determination
that
fda
had
made--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--obviously,
it
still
gets
much
closer,
and
at
that
point,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
you
know,
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
issues
surrounding
this
case,
but
none
of
them
actually
seem
to
be
presented
in
this
case,
because
here...
i
mean,
the
statute
clearly
requires
a
determination
of
fraud
on
the
fda,
including
all
the
elements
i
mentioned,
as
a
necessary
predicate
for
recovery;
and,
two,
fda
has
not
made
such
a
determination.
thank
you.
