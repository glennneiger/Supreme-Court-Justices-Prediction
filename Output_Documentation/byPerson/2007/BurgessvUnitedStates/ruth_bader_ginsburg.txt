justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
going
on
with
this
line?
you
say
that
both
the
802(13)
definition
has
to
be
satisfied
and
the
44
definition,
right?
but
was
802(13)
ever
applicable
to
this
situation?
what
was
the
law
prior
to
the
1994
amendment?
there
was
a
section,
wasn't
there,
that
defined
"felony
drug
offense"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
take
a
look
at
that
provision
that
was
in
841(b)(1)?
because
it
seems
that
it
would
be
duplicative
of
802(13).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
read...
read
the
end
of
it.
read
on
where
it
says,
"or
a
felony
under
any
law
of
a
state
or
foreign
country.
"
et
cetera.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
defines
what
the
felony
is:
"a
felony
under
any
law
of
a
state
or
foreign
country
that
prohibits
or
restricts
conduct
relating
to
narcotic
drugs,
marijuana.
"
et
cetera.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
you
need
to
look--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fisher,
could
i
just
go
back
to
what
you
quoted.
are
you
quoting...
you're
quoting
a
sentencing
guideline,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
a
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
of
course,
they
had
to
leave
it
on
the
books
because
they
need
a
definition
of
"felony".
"felony"
has
to
be
defined
in
many
places,
but
this
is
a
definition
of
"felony
drug
offense".
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--just
one.
you
said
that
in
most
states
what
burgess
did,
his
crime,
simple
possession,
would
not
encounter
a
sentence
of
upward
of
one
year.
did
you
do
a
survey?
did
you
document
that
in
your
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
suppose
it
might
for
countries
that
use
that
classification,
for
common
law
countries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
information
we
have
in
the
brief
says
that
there
are
two
states
that
have
dropped
those
labels.
are
there
more
than
new
jersey
and
maine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
petitioner
keith
burgess
pleaded
guilty
to
a
federal
drug
offense
that
ordinarily
carries
a
10-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
that
minimum
doubles
to
20
years
for
defendants
previously
convicted
of
a
felony
drug
offense.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
burgess'
prior
south
carolina
conviction
for
cocaine
possession
punishable
by
more
than
one
year's
imprisonment
but
classified
by
state
law
as
a
misdemeanor
ranks
as
a
felony
drug
offense.
two
statutory
definitions
figure
in
our
decision.
the
first
defines
the
unadorned
term
felony
to
mean,
any
offense
classified
by
applicable
federal
or
state
law
as
a
felony.
the
second
defines
the
term
felony
drug
offense
to
mean
a
drug
offense
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
more
than
one
year
under
any
law
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
or
foreign
country.
burgess
argues
that
a
crime
counts
as
a
felony
drug
offense
only
if
it
qualifies
under
both
definitions
that
is,
the
offense,
he
urges,
must
be
both
classified
as
a
felony
under
the
law
of
the
punishing
jurisdiction
and
punishable
by
more
than
one
year
in
prison.
the
government
in
contrast
reads
the
definition
of
the
term
“felony
drug
offense”
as
the
exclusive
reference.
defendants
convicted
of
drug
felonies
in
violation
of
federal
law
whose
prior
drug
crimes
were
punishable
by
more
than
one
year
in
prison.
the
government
urges
must
receive
a
20-year
minimum
sentence
regardless
of
the
punishing
jurisdictions
classification
of
the
prior
offense.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
government
as
did
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
we
granted
review
to
resolve
a
circuit
split,
and
now
affirmed.
for
purposes
of
the
federal
sentencing
enhancement
we
hold,
the
definition
of
the
compound
term
“felony
drug
offense,”
and
only
that
definition
counts.
among
our
reasons,
congress
used
the
words,
“felony
drug
offense”
as
a
term
of
art.
a
definition
stating
what
a
term
means
as
the
definition
of
felony
drug
offense
does,
generally
excludes
any
unstated
meaning.
furthermore,
in
law
books,
the
word
felony
is
commonly
defined
to
mean
a
crime
punishable
by
more
than
one
year
in
prison.
defining
felony
drug
offense
just
that
way
as
congress
did,
leaves
no
blank
for
a
discrete
statutory
definition
of
felony
to
fill.
our
reading
avoids
anomalies
that
would
arise
if
two
different
definitions
governed
the
application
of
the
20-year
federal
minimum
sentence.
the
statutory
definition
of
felony
includes
state
and
federal
offenses
but
does
not
include
foreign
offenses.
congress'
definition
of
felony
drug
offense
however,
expressly
includes
foreign
offenses,
holding
that
both
definitions
apply
moreover,
would
leave
unanswered
the
appropriate
classification
of
drug
convictions
in
jurisdictions
that
do
not
label
offenses
as
felonies
or
misdemeanors.
our
construction
of
the
statute
hardly
renders
the
separate
definition
of
felony
extraneous,
that
definition
is
controlling
for
the
many
statutory
provisions
that
use
the
word
felony
unmodified.
the
statute's
drafting
history
reinforces
our
reading
of
the
legislative
text.
in
1994,
congress
amended
the
definition
of
felony
drug
offense.
it
replaced
the
words
“offense
that
is
a
felony
under
any
law
of
the
state,”
with
the
words
"offense
that
is
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
more
than
one
year
under
any
law
of
a
state."
an
evident
purpose
of
the
1994
revision
was
to
eliminate
disparities
resulting
from
divergent
state
classifications
of
offenses
by
adopting
a
uniform
federal
standard
based
solely
on
the
authorized
length
of
imprisonment.
finally,
burgess
urges
us
to
decide
the
case
in
his
favor
based
on
the
rule
of
lenity,
the
touchstone
of
that
rule
is
statutory
ambiguity
because
congress
expressly
defined
felony
drug
offense
in
the
manner
coherent,
complete,
and
by
all
signs
exclusive.
there
is
no
ambiguity
for
the
rule
of
lenity
to
resolve.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
