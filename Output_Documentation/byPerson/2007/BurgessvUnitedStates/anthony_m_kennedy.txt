is
it
time-honored
since
granderson?
is
that
the
first
time
we
did
it?
justice
anthony

as
to
sentences?

--better
example.
it
doesn't
quite
work
because
it
does
not
supersede
the
term
"debtor"
that
was
used
earlier.
in
the
government's
submission
at
least
in
this
case,

so
it
seems
to
me
they're
not
comparable
in
that
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
what
happened
in
south
carolina?
could
he
on
those
facts
and
under
the
charges
have
been
sentenced
to
more
than
a
year?
it
was
just
that
the
judge
gave
him
less
than
a
year?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
he,
himself,
was
eligible
for
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
us
just
a
little
bit
about
the
rule
of
lenity?
you
want
us
to
apply
sort
of
a
watered
down
discount
rule
of
lenity
in
sentencing
cases?
and
do
you
have
authority
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
after
we
said
in
granderson
the
rule
of
lenity
applies
without
qualifying
or
modifying
it
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
there
has
to
be
a
real
ambiguity.
i
mean,
if
there
is
a
plausible
defendant-friendly
interpretation,
that
doesn't
trigger
the
rule
of
lenity,
does
it
or
doesn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
in
a
context
where
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
conduct
was
criminal
at
all
not
since.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
apply
clear
statement
rule
to
the
sentencing
code,
i
don't
think
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
beyond
the
second
sentence.
