mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
rule
of
lenity
requires
that
any
penal
statute
the
government
seeks
to
enforce
against
an
individual
must
clearly
and
unambiguous
apply
to
him
and,
as
the
government
acknowledges
its
brief
in
this
case,
this
court
has
applied
the
rule
of
lenity
in
numerous
recent
cases
involving
mandatory
sentencing
provisions.
a
reaffirmation
of
that
time-honored
principle
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
decide
this
case.
the
20-year
mandatory--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
the
rule
of
lenity
has
been--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--as
to
sentencing?
no,
in
the
mid-20th
century,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
bell
decision
written
by
justice
frankfurter
and
in
ladner,
both
involved
the
degree
of
punishment
which
the
defendant
would
receive.
there
are
other
cases:
in
1980
the
simpson
case,
and
bifulco
around
the
same
time.
so
this
court
has
a
history
of
applying
the
rule
of
lenity
with
equal
force
to
sentencing
provisions
as
it
does
to
statutes
demarcating
criminal
conduct
or
not.
and
of
course,
as
the
green
brief
specially
highlights,
the
very
essence
and
the
core
of
the
rule
of
lenity
derives
from
the
english
common
law,
which
is...
which
was
designed
to
invoke
the
rule
of
lenity
to
avoid
mandatory
punishment,
not...
not
so
much
whether
conduct
was
criminal
or
not.
so
we
think
that
applying
that
rule
in
a
straightforward
manner
to
this
case
requires
a
reversal.
the
20-year
mandatory
minimum
in
section
841(b)(1)(a)
applies
only
to
defendants
who
have
a
prior
conviction
for
a,
quote,
"felony
drug
offense".
now,
a
sensible
reading
of
that
provision
is
that
a
state
law
misdemeanor
simply
does
not
constitute
a
felony
drug
offense.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
that's
all
you
had
on
the
statute
books
this
might
be
an
easier
case.
but
as
you
know,
i
think,
above
section
44
and
section
13
the
term
"felony"
is
described
and
defined
as
"a
crime
that
is
classified
as
a
felony
under
federal
or
state
law.
"
and
so
when
you
start
with
section
841(b)(1)(a),
which
uses
the
term
"felony
drug
offense",
and
you
go
to
the
definitional
section,
the
first
thing
you
come
to
is
the
definition
of
felony,
which
says
a
crime
classified
as
such.
and
then,
as
you
say,
in
section
44
you
reach
another
definition.
so
we
think
that
at
the
very
least
you
have
an
ambiguity
here
in
which
congress
has
given
two
facially
applicable
definitions
to
the
operative
provision
of
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
in
a
sense
it's
our
position
that
both
are
at
issue
here.
the
term
"felony",
which
is
within
the
term
"felony
drug
offense",
is
also
at
issue
here.
and
as
we've
pointed
out
in
pages
11
and
12,
11
and
12
of
our
yellow
brief,
it's
not
uncommon
for
congress
to
have
two
separate
definitions
one
of
which
is
a
single
term
within
a
broader
term
in
a
statute.
and
so
the
mere
fact,
as
the
government
would
argue,
that
the
word
44
does
not
mean
that
congress
meant
that
to
be
the
sole
definition.
we've
given
three
examples
on
pages
11
and
12
where
the
sensible
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
congress
attempted
to
nest
the
definition
of
a
single
term
within
the
definition
of
a
broader
term.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
there
is
an
agreement
between
us
and
the
government
on
this
point.
we
cite
in
our
blue
brief
statutes
from
arizona
as
well
as
a
couple
of
other
states
where
there
are
crimes
that
are
classified
as
felonies
but
punishable
in
less
than
a
year.
and
in
those
cases
we
agree
with
the
government
that
that
is
the
effect
of
the
1994
conforming
amendments,
is
to
exclude
those
outlier
states
that
take
low-level
crimes
and
nonetheless
classify
them
as
felonies.
what
this
case
is
about--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
that
works
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
justice
alito.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
it
is
quite
plausible
that
the
language
that
congress
added
has
very
little
practical
effect.
and
that
flows
from
the
fact
that
congress
called
these
nothing
more
than
conforming
amendments,
so
congress
apparently
wasn't
trying
to
accomplish
any
dramatic
change
here
and
i
think
it
might
help
to
understand
by
looking
at
the
other
outlier
states
that
the
government
claims
got
swept
in
with
the
1994
amendments.
we
cite
statutes
from
states
like
colorado.
perhaps
if
i
used
a
concrete
example.
take
possession
of
a
single
ounce
of
marijuana.
that
is
one
of
the
crimes
in
arizona
that
we
were
just
talking
about,
that
is
a
felony
punishable
by
no
more
than
a
year.
there
are
a
few
other
states
who
are
outliers
in
a
different
sense,
in
which
they
call
these
crimes
misdemeanors,
like
the
vast
majority
of
states,
but
make
them
punishable
by
18
months
or
more.
and
so
what
the
government's
position
is
is
that
in
1994
when
congress
passed
a
conforming
amendment
to
exclude
a
couple
of
outlier
states
like
arizona,
it
was
trying
to
sweep
in
for
the
first
time
into
section
841(b)(1)(a)
outlier
states
like
colorado
that
treat
low-level
drug
crimes,
low-level
drug
possession
crimes,
as
misdemeanors
that
are
punishable
by
more
than
a
year.
so
we
think,
for
the
very
reasons
the
government
explains,
that
congress
is
trying
to
avoid
disuniformity
and
happenstance
according
to
how
a
few
local
jurisdictions
might
treat
certain
drug
crimes,
that
it
makes
sense
to
read
the
'94
conforming
amendments
as
requiring
both
the
one-year
punishment
rule
and
the
felony
classification
requirement.
and
if
you
have
any
doubt
on
that,
we
submit
it
really
makes
sense
to
remember
that
what
we're
what
talking
about
here
is
a
mandatory
minimum.
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
we've
cited
a
case
in
our
brief
in
the
second
circuit
that
deals
with
that
exact
problem,
at
least
with
the
new
jersey
problem.
and
what
the
courts
did
and
what
they
have
done
in
other
circumstances
where
there's
a
felony
classification
requirement
is
they
simply
take
the
crime
in
new
jersey
and
analogize
it
to
a
comparable
federal
or
local
state
crime,
and
if
it
was...
if
it
would
be
classified
as
a
felony
in
that
local
jurisdiction,
then
courts...
and
this
is
even
before
the
1994
amendments...
courts
have
treated
it
as
a
felony.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
believe,
justice
alito,
this
was
a
case
before
1994,
so
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right,
because
that
is
the
federal
definition
of
a
felony,
and
so
that
was
the
analogy
that
the
second
circuit
was
able
to
draw
here
and
reach
what
we
think
is
a
commonsense
way
to
deal
with
the
unusual
problem
of
new
jersey.
another--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--all
three
of
them
do,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
they're
pages
11
and
12
of
the
yellow
brief.
and
so
the
first
place
to
start
is
looking
at
the
bottom
of
page
11,
where
the
term
"employee"
is
defined
in
one
provision
of
the
federal...
of
the
federal
statutory
code.
and
then
the
terms
"employee
of
the
capitol
police",
"employee
of
the
house
of
representatives.
"
are
also
defined,
and
they're
defined...
and
those
broader
definitions
are
in
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
12.
and
so
you
see
that
there,
after
having
defined
the
term
"employee",
the
word
"employee"
is
not
repeated
in
those
definitions.
they
talk
about
"a
member"
or
"an
officer"
or
"an
individual".
and
so
it's
much
like
the
circumstance
here,
where
a
more
generic
term
is
used
in
the
broader
definition,
but
it
makes
sense
to
read
in
the
original
definition.
the
same
thing
i
think
you
can
see
in
the
middle
of
page
12
with
the
part
of
the
bankruptcy
code
that
we've
given
this
court.
the
word
"debtor"
is
defined
in
a
certain
way,
and
then
later
on
in
the
definitional
provision,
the
term
"debtor's
principal
residence"
is
defined
as
"a
residential
structure"
and
such
and
such.
again
the
word
"debtor"
is
not
repeated
in
the
broader
definition,
but
we
think
the
only
way
to
make
sense
of
it
is
to
import
the
definition
of
the
single
term
into
the
broader
term.
if
congress
had
wanted--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
there
might
be,
you
know,
a
very
rigid
plain-text
argument
that
might
be
made.
the
point
is
that
congress
used...
defined
the
term
"debtor's
principal
residence"
without
using
the
term
"debtor"
again
and
defined
it
somewhere
else.
my--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
then
i
think
i'd
refer
you
back
to
the
employee
example.
i
mean,
no
example
is
going
to
be
exactly
on
all
fours.
i'm
happy
to
acknowledge
that.
the
idea
that
i'm
trying
to
get
across
is
it's
not
unusual
for
congress
to
define
single
terms
that
are
nested
within
larger
terms.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
one
way
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--okay.
i
think
one
way
to
understand
how
this
statute...
if
congress
had
wanted
to
do
what
the
government
says
it
wanted
to
do,
how
congress
could
have
made
it
absolutely
clear...
while
we
have
the
yellow
brief
open,
we
can
look
at
page
13.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
for
a
time,
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but...
so
when
the
statute
was
originally
passed,
802(13)
was
the
sole
definition
of
'94
amendments,
a
definition
of
841(b)(1)(a)--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but
that
itself
just
used
the
word
802(13).
so,
again,
i
think
there
is
an
agreement
between--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--are
you
looking,
justice
ginsburg,
at
the
1988
version
of
the
statute?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
because--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--oh,
this
is
at
13a
of
the
blue
brief,
justice
scalia.
so,
at
page
13a
it
says,
"for
purposes
of
this
subparagraph,
the
term
"felony
drug
offense"
means
an
offense
that
is
a
felony
under
any
provision
of
this
subchapter,
under
any
federal
law.
"
now,
the
word
802(13).
if
i
understand--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
but
i
think,
again,
the
word
802(13)
as
of
1988--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--because
there
isn't
the
explicit
classification
requirement.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
the
latter
language,
justice
ginsburg,
is
defining--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--"drug
offense",
whereas
the
word
"felony"
i
think
is
not
a
self-defining
term
in
that
statute
as
it's
written.
and
to
understand
whether
we're
talking
about
something
like
a
one-year
rule
or
a
classification
requirement,
the
reader
needs
to
go
back
to
the
definitional
section.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
as
of
1988?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
it
says
"a
felony
under
the
law
of
a
state.
"
so
i
think
the
classification
requirement...
i
don't
think
it's
inconsistent
with
it.
it
might
clarify
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
guess
you
could,
but
then
you
wouldn't
have
a
definition;
then
you'd
have
to
figure
out
how
to
define
"felony",
whether
it
was
a
classification
or
a
one-year
rule
or
something
else.
i
think
the
natural
reading,
again,
would
be
a
classification
requirement
to
the
extent
to
which
you
couldn't
look
further
than
that
provision
of
the
statute,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
we
don't
disagree
with
the
government
that
the
one-year
rule
does
serve
the
purpose
of
helping
iron
out--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
with
due
respect,
if
you
look
at
the
way
different
states
treat
drug
crimes--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
what
i'm
trying
to
respond...
different
states
treat
drug
crimes
dramatically
different,
and
this
is
so...
i
think
it's
common
sense
that
states
treat
different
crimes...
treat...
different
states
punish
the
same
crime
differently.
and
that's
nowhere
more
true
than
in
drug
crime,
because
there's
a
great
amount
of
experimentation
that
goes
on
in
the
states.
and
one
of
the
things
that
certain
states
do,
like
colorado,
is
take
very
low-level
drug
crimes
and
punish
them
by
more
than
a
year,
in
part
so
they
can
give
treatment
and
keep
people
in,
prison,
long
enough
to
have
treatment
take
hold,
whereas
some
other
states
treat
drug
crimes
very
differently.
so
you
have
a
patchwork
whether
you
look
to
the
classification
or
whether
you
look
to
the
one-year
rule.
that's
why
we
think
it
makes
sense
to
use
both.
now,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
do
what
the
government
is
suggesting,
which
is
have
the
one-year
rule
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
way
of
determining
whether
you
have
a
felony
before
you,
it
could
have
very
easily
said
so.
and
there's
an
example...
and
this
is
at
page
13
of
the
yellow
brief...
of
what...
of
what
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
do.
they
define...
in
a
"career-offender
provision"
there
is
a
definition
of
"felony"
there
that
is
quite
explicit.
they
say
a
"felony"
is
"an
offense
punishable
by
more
than
a
year,
regardless
of
whether
such
an
offense
is
specifically
designated
as
a
"felony".
"
so
there
are
other
provisions
where
congress
could
have
looked
and
it
would
have
been
well
aware
of
how
to
make
absolutely
plain
what
it
was
trying
to
accomplish
in
the
statute.
now,
we
don't
think
that
the
government's
reading
is
implausible,
justice
breyer,
for
the
reason--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
i'm
quoting
the
sentencing
guideline,
although
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act
you
can
find
another
place
where
congress
dealt
with
this
problem
explicitly.
it
said
that
felonies
are
crimes
punishable
more
than
a
year;
however,
if
the
state
classifies
the
crime
as
a
misdemeanor,
it
has
to
be
punishable
by
more
than
two
years.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
justice
scalia,
with
the
problem--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--not
necessarily,
but
leaving
that
clause--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
our
position
is,
justice
scalia,
that,
standing
alone,
i
will
grant
you;
but
the
problem
as
we
see
it
in
this
case
is
that
that
is
left
out.
in
a
very
common
problem,
how
to
define
a
felony,
they
leave
out
that
explicit
statement
of
whether
classification
is
important.
and
what
is
more,
in
the
same
definitional
provision--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
there's
a
good
reason
why
congress
put
it
in,
and
that's
because
it
is
a
continually
vexing
problem,
how
to
define
what
is
a
felony.
that's
why
congress
did
it
explicitly
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
that's
why
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
explicit
here.
and
leaving
that
out,
and
against
the
backdrop
of
a
statute
where
the
classification
rule
was
the
controlling
rule
for
over
a
decade,
and
where
they
leave
that
classification
rule
in
the
very
same
definitional
provision
of
the
statute,
we
think,
gives
rise
to
an
ambiguity.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
with
all
due
respect,
what
congress
did
is
they
left
802(13)
on
the
books,
which
does
turn
on
classifications.
and
it's
not...
even
though
it
is
a...
it
is
something
of
a
patchwork,
it
is
not
unusual
at
all
to
have
very
serious
consequences
turn
on
whether
something
is
classified
as
a
"felony"
or
not.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
again,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
is
right.
but
then
what
congress
could
have
done
is
use
the
language
that
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
use,
or
something
comparable
to
make
clear
its
intent.
and
the
classification
of
a
felony
or
not
a
felony,
as
this
court
knows,
has
a
time-honored
import.
things
like
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
bear
arms,
the
right
to
various
civil
rights
turn
on
whether
somebody
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor.
and,
again,
this
brings
us
in
a
sense
back
to
the
rule
of
lenity
because
one
of
the
principal
reasons
for
the
rule
of
lenity
is
fair
notice.
now,
this
court,
as
early
as
the
mcboyle
decision
recognized
that
we're
dealing
with
something
of
a
fiction
when
we
imagine
an
offender
is
looking
at
the
statutory
books
to
decide
whether
certain
conduct
is
prohibited
or
not.
but
in
the
context
of
recidivist
enhancements
that
lead
to
mandatory
minimums,
we're
talking
about
very
real
and
serious
notice
problems.
imagine
the
conscientious
public
defender
advising
someone
like
mr.
burgess
as
to
whether
he
should
plead
guilty
to
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony.
this
happens
in
states
across
the
country
that
have
three-strike
provisions,
that
have
very
serious
immigration
consequences
turning
on
"felony"
or
"misdemeanor".
that
lawyer
might
have
concluded,
as
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
did,
that
pleading
to
a
misdemeanor
here
would
not
expose
mr.
burgess
in
the
event
he
was
convicted
of
a
later
crime
to
such
a
serious
punishment
as
the
20-year
mandatory
minimum
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
burgess's
crime,
possession
of
cocaine,
was
punishable
by
up
to
two
years.
so,
yes,
he
received
a
sentence
far
less
than
that.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
the
crime
to
which
he
pled
guilty
was
punishable
by
two
years.
but
you
should
understand
that
that
kind
of
hypothetical,
punishable-by
problem
is
one
i
know
this
court
dealt
with
a
couple
of
months
ago
in
the
rodriguez
case.
and
you
should
understand
that
not
just
what
congress,
under
the
government's
view,
had
been
looking
to
sweep
in
outlier
states
like
colorado,
but
if
the
government
prevails
in
the
rodriguez
case
where
the
term
1994
amendments,
which
were
termed
"conforming
amendments",
have
an
even
far
more
sweeping
effect
and
bring
in
lots
of
state-law
misdemeanors
that
were
never
covered
by
the
prior
act.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
but
i
said
earlier,
justice
ginsburg,
giving
the
example
of
possession
of
one
ounce
of
marijuana,
that
the
vast
majority
of
states
punished
that
as
a
misdemeanor
by
less
than
a
year.
mr.
burgess's
crime,
at
best,
was
a
misdemeanor
punishable
by
less
than
a
year
under
federal
law,
but
different
states
treat
that
crime
differently.
and
i
think
a
majority
of
those,
a
majority
of
states,
would
treat
that
as
a
crime
punishable
by
more
than
a
year
and
classified
as
a
"felony.
"
"if
there
are
no
more
questions--
"
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
might
pick
up
where
justice
kennedy
left
off
with
the
rule
of
lenity,
because
we
don't
want
this
court
to
lose
sight
of
the
importance
of
the
rule
of
lenity
in
this
case.
it's
not
our
position
that
the
government's
reading
is
unreasonable.
it
is
simply
our
position
that
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
a
possible
one
and
that
congress
may
have
been--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think,
justice
kennedy,
a
fair
way
to
ask
yourself
the
question
is,
would
the
statute
here
rise
to
the
level
of
a
plain
statement
of
a
kind
that
is
required
to,
for
example,
abrogate
sovereign
immunity
or
to
realign
the
federal
state
balance.
the
term
"clear
statement"
and
"clear
and
definition
statement"
that
is
used
in
the
historical
context--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
that's
what
the
historical
cases
say.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
with
all
due
respect.
if
you
look
at
the
examples
in
blackstone,
that's
the
greenbury
cite,
if
you
look
at
this
court's
earliest
cases,
chief
justice
marshall
wrote
for
the
court
in
wiltberger
that
even
though
it's
extremely
improbable
that
congress
wanted
the
result
that
the
defendant
presses,
the
court
is
nevertheless
going
to
insist
on
it,
because
it
is
not
unambiguously
clear
this
was
congress'
intent.
and
so,
it's
easy
to
forget
given
the
modern
proliferation
of
federal
criminal
statutes
how
rare
criminal
cases
used
to
be
in
this
court.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
this
is
very
important,
justice
scalia,
your
cases,
especially
the
historical
cases
and
the
modern
ones,
i
think,
waffle
in
different
directions,
but
there
are
plenty
of
cases
from
this
court
that
are
much
more
than
a
tie-breaker
in
the
sense
of
the
rule
of
lenity
and
say,
we
require
clear
and
definite
terms,
that's
the
phrase
justice
frankfurter
used
to
repeat.
justice
holmes
said
the
statute
must
be
clear.
even
up
to
granderson
it
says--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
but
for
the
reason--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
with
due
respect
what
you're
going
to
do
is
actually
reduce
the
number
of
cases
this
court
hears,
because
once
you
have
a
clear
statement
rule,
two
things
are
going
to
happen.
the
lower
courts
are
going
to
find
it
more...
easier
to
resolve
these
kinds
of
cases
because
just
like
in
the
sovereign
immunity
and
federalism
context,
it's
much
easier
to
look
for
a
clear
statement.
and
even
more
importantly,
congress
will
know
that
when
it
legislates
in
the
realm
of
criminal
sentencing,
that
it
needs
to
be
clear,
and
it
will
solve
this
case...
this
court
the
problem,
perhaps,
of
having
four
or
five
cases
on
its
docket
every
term
involving
circuit
splits
and
how
to
apply
mandatory
minimums
in
the
vast
labyrinth
of
federal
criminal
sentencing
provisions.
so
we
think
this
court
can
rest
assured,
of
course,
that
if
it
rules
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
congress
doesn't
like
the
result,
that
it
is
well
and
able
and
ready
to
step
in
to
solve
that
problem.
the
problem
is,
is
that
if
this
court
accepts
broad
readings
of
the
government,
from
the
government
of
criminal
statutes,
that
the
institutional
forces
that
drive
legislation
are...
make
it
much
less
likely
that
congress
can
step
in
to
solve
that
problem
in
favor
of
criminal
defendants.
so
for
the
reasons
we've
explained,
we
think
this
court
should
go
back
to
the
historical
understanding
brought
forward
to
the
present
of
the
importance
of
the
rule
of
lenity,
and
in
this
case
find
that
the
statute
does
not
clearly
and
unambiguously
apply
to
petitioner.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit
the
case.
