justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
following
true,
that
if
you
are
right
the
reason
congress
passed
this
new
definition
was
it
wanted
to
take
those
handful
of
states
which
have
felonies
as
a
year,
the
ones
justice
alito
is
talking
about,
and
make
clear
that
they
are
not
covered?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
if
the
government's
right,
then
the
reason
congress
did
this
is
that
it
recognized
what
i
think
is
the
truth,
that
felonies
and
misdemeanors
are
defined
differently
in
many
different
ways
under
the
laws
of
many
different
states
and,
in
a
matter
where
so
much
prison
time
turns
on
it,
wished
to
create
a
single,
uniform
definition.
now,
if
that's
right,
i'm
asking
myself
which
is
a
more
plausible
purpose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't,
because
if
you're
right,
then
you
first
have
to
look
to
the
patchwork
quilt
of
laws
in
all
the
different
states
to
see
whether
those
different
states
define
the
conduct
as
misdemeanors
or
felonies.
and
then,
having
solved
the
patchwork
problem,
we
add
on
the
requirement
of
one
year.
and
so
the
bite
of
the
new
definition
would
be
what
justice
alito
said
and
nothing
else.
now,
that's...
and,
yet,
on
the
government's
interpretation,
the
bite
is
to
create
a
single,
readily
applied,
uniform
rule.
now,
if
i
ask
myself
which
of
those
is
most
plausible,
i
hate
to
tell
you
which
answer
i
get.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right?
i
mean,
i
put
that
out
to
give
you
a
chance
to
say.
i'm
not
sure
i
am
right.
