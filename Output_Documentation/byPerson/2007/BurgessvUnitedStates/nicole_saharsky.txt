ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
answered
the
question
presented
in
this
case
when
it
adopted
an
express
definition
for
"felony
drug
offense".
under
that
definition,
"felony
drug
offense"
means
an
offense
punishable
by
more
than
one
year
of
imprisonment
under
certain
state,
federal,
or
foreign
drug
laws.
there
is
no
textual
basis
for
going
beyond
that
definition
to
also
require
that
an
offense
be
classified
as
a
"felony".
the
enhancement
trigger
in
the
sentencing-enhancement
provision
is
a
felony
drug
offense,
and
the
way
that
the
definition
works
is
that
you
take
the
definition
congress
provided
for
"felony
drug
offense".
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
the
term
"felony
drug
offense",
the
"drug"
component
we
understand
to
be
the
component
that
says
"an
offense"
that
prohibits...
"under
law
that
prohibits
or
restricts
conduct
related
to
narcotic
drugs,
marijuana,
anabolic
steroids--
"
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--there
is
a
definition
of
802.
it
refers
back
to
the
general
definition
of
321
of
the
controlled--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
term
"felony
drug
offense"
has
only
the
meaning
that
congress
gave
to
it.
in
the
words
it
shows
that
it
be
punishable
by
more
than
one
year
under
state,
federal
or
foreign
law
relating
to
those
particular
drugs.
in
fact,
the
question
that
you
asked
shows
why
petitioner's
reading
of
the
statute
cannot
be
correct,
that
you
can't
use
both
the
definition
of
"felony
drug
offense"
that
congress
provided
and
try
to
import
in
separate
definitions
for
"felony"
and
separate
definitions
for
"drug",
because
the
definition
of
"drug"
in
the
controlled
substances
act
is
very
broad
and
applies
to
many
different
kinds
of
drugs,
whereas
the
definition
of
"felony
drug
offense"
only
refers
to
offenses
that
involve
narcotic
drugs,
anabolic
steroids,
marijuana
or
depressant
or
stimulant
substances.
in
the
same
way,
this
shows
why
petitioner
cannot
be
correct
that
the
definition
of
"felony"
also
must
be
brought
into
"felony
drug
offense",
because
congress
chose
that
the
measure
of
seriousness
in
"felony
drug
offense"
is
an
offense
punishable
by
more
than
one
year.
and
it
actually
took
out
of
the
statute
the
measure
of
seriousness
which
is
classification
as
a
felony.
so
to
bring
that
requirement
back
in
would
undo
the
change
that
congress
made
in
1994.
that's
the
language,
justice
ginsburg,
that
we
were
looking
at
at
the
bottom
of
the...
at
the
back
of
the
blue
book.
in
1988
it
said
""felony
drug
offense"
means
an
offense
which
is
a
felony.
"
and
that
language
was
taken
out
and
congress
replaced
it
with
this
new
language,
which
says
"punishable
by
more
than
one
year
of
imprisonment.
"
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
congress
chose
the
words
that
it
did,
"punishable
by
more
than
one
year.
"
because
it
believed
it
to
be
a
good
measure
of
seriousness.
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
like
blanton
versus
city
of
north
las
vegas
that
the
term
of
imprisonment
that
a
legislature
chooses
is
a
good
measure
of
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
there
may
be
offenses
that
a
state
classifies
as
more
or
less
serious
based
on
punishment,
but
congress
wanted
to
do
its
best
to
get
uniformity
in
provision...
in
this
provision.
so
what
it
did
here
was
to
take
out
this
requirement
that
would
look
to
varying
state
and
foreign
laws
and
instead
have
one
that
was
just
based
on
term
of
imprisonment.
and
actually
this...
this
raises
a
very
serious
problem
with
petitioner's
reading
of
the
statute,
which
is
with
respect
to
foreign
offenses.
the
"felony
drug
offense"
definition
allows
an
enhancement
based
on
state,
federal
or
foreign
offenses,
and
the
definition
of
"felony"
unadorned
and
standing
by
itself
doesn't
refer
to
foreign
offenses
at
all,
which
means
that
there
is
a
serious
ambiguity
if
both
apply
as
to
what
would
be
done
in
the
case
of
trying
to
enhance
based
on
a
foreign
offense.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
there
are
countries
that
do
use
the
felony-misdemeanor
distinction.
there
are
some
that
do
not.
but
we
understand
in
1994
that
congress...
the
change
congress
made
to
be
one
that
eliminates
those
kinds
of
ambiguities.
and
certainly,
if
congress
had
thought
in
1994
that
both
the
separate
definition
of
felony
and
the
definition
of
felony
drug
offense
mattered,
that
it
would
have
placed
foreign
offenses
in
the
definition
of
felony,
and
it
didn't
do
that
here.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
new
jersey
and
maine
are
the
only
ones
that
i'm
aware
of.
certainly,
as
this
court
discussed
in
some
previous
questions,
there
may
be
ways
in
which
courts
could
try
to
work
around
ambiguities
that,
for
example,
existed
in
the
statute
1990...
prior
to
1994,
to
figure
out
how
offenses
in
new
jersey
should
be
treated.
but
the
fact
that
congress
made
the
change
in
1994
to
pick
clear
language
that
would
just
turn
on
the
authorized
term
of
imprisonment
shows
that
that's
what
should
be
used,
that
choice
should
be
given
effect.
the
fact
that
courts
might
be
able
to
deal
with
an
ambiguous
statute
certainly
does
not
give
license
to
create
one
where
it
doesn't
otherwise
exist.
there's
an
example
the
petitioner
raised,
which
is
how
violent
felonies
are
treated
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
and
i
think
that
that...
that
illustrates
how
congress
could
have
done
what
petitioner
wanted
if
that
was,
in
fact,
its
intent.
in
the
acca,
a
violent
felony,
which
could
be
the
basis
for
a
sentence
enhancement,
is
defined
as
various
violent
offenses
that
are
punishable
by
imprisonment
exceeding
one
year.
but
then
congress
specifically
decided
that
it
wanted
to
exempt
state
misdemeanor
offenses
that
it
didn't
consider
serious
enough
to
qualify
as
violent
felonies.
so
it
exempted
state
offenses
that
are
classified
as
misdemeanors
and
punishable
by
less
than
two
years.
and
we
think
that
the
congress'
treatment
in
the
acca
exempting
specific
state
offenses
shows
that
if
congress
had
wanted
to
exempt
offenses
classified
as
misdemeanors
in
the
way
that
petitioner
suggests,
then
it
would
have
done
so
in
that
way.
congress
chose
a
meaning
here
for
"felony
drug
offense"
and
we
think
that
it
needs
to
be
given
effect.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
the
government--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
government's
position
is
that
the
rule
of
lenity
operates
in
the
same
manner
in
both
the
defining
the
offense
context
and
in
the
sentencing
context.
the
point
that
we
were
making
in
our
brief
is
that
the
purposes
behind
the
rule
of
lenity
are
really
implicated
to
a
lesser
extent
when
we're
talking
about
sentencing,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
mandatory
minimums,
because
there's
not
a
question
of
whether
the
offense
conduct
at
issue
is
illegal,
and
there's
not
a
question
about
the
maximum
offense,
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
the
person
could
be
subject
to.
so,
our
brief
should
be
best
understood
as
a
response
to
petitioner's
extensive
historical
discussion
of
the
rule
of
lenity
and
a
suggestion
that
it
applies
with
even
more
vigor
in
the
context
of
mandatory
minimums.
we
don't
think
that
that's
the
case,
but
at
the
same
time
we
are
not
suggesting
there
is
a
new
different
rule
of
lenity
in
this
context.
and
again,
we
don't
see
this
as
a
rule
of
lenity
case.
congress
picked
a
particular
definition
and
it
used
those
terms...
that
term
"felony
drug
offense"
to
trigger
each
of
the
sentencing
enhancement
provisions
here.
we
don't
think
there
is
any
reason
to
look
beyond
it.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
government
submits
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
