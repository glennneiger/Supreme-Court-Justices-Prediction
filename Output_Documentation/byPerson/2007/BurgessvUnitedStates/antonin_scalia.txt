you
say
there
are
other
examples
where
a...
a
noun
that
is
nested
in
another
definition
is
separately
defined
and
the
two
are
read
together.
how
are
those
phrased?
i
mean,
i
could
understand
what
you
say
if
this
provision
here
read
"the
term
"felony
drug
offense"
means
a
felony
that
is
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
more
than
one
year.
"
then
i'd
go
back
to
the
"felony"
definition
for
what
a
felony
means,
but
it
doesn't
repeat
the
"felony".
"the
term
"felony
drug
offense"
means
an
offense
that
is
punishable
by
imprisonment
for.
"
--do
any
of
the
examples
of
nesting
that
you...
that
you
bring
forward
read
this
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
ones
are
they?
where
are
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
would
we
find
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
the
definitional
section
contradicts...
contradicts
what's
in
(b)(1)(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
it
contradicts
it
because
the
"felony"
definition
is
classified
as
felony
by
federal
or
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
"under
any
provision
of
this
subchapter
or
any
other
federal
law
that
prohibits
or
restricts.
"
and
then
in
the
last
part,
"under
any
law
of
a"...
of
"state"...
it
picks
up
"state"...
"or
a
foreign
country".
802(13).
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
say
that
there
"felony"
stands
on
its
own,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think...
you
think
it
would
mean
something
different
if
you
just
left
out
the
"regardless
of"
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
"prior
adult
federal
or
state
conviction
for
an
offense
punishable
by
death
or
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
one
year.
"
you
think
it
means
something
different
without
the
"regardless".
justice
antonin
scalia
not
at
all?
not
possibly.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
say
that
"regardless"
clause
is
extraordinary
and
i
would
not
want
to
have
to
deal
with
such
prolix
statutes
on
a
regular
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
statutes
exist
like
that,
my
goodness?
you
want
the
government
to
be
held
in
all
statutes
to
a
level
that
is
clear
enough
to
satisfy
the
clear
statement--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
what
the
rule
of
lenity
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
our
cases
reflect
what
you're
saying?
i
thought
our
cases
on
the
rule
of
lenity
say
that
where
there
is
an
ambiguity
you
give
the
tie
to
the
defendant.
