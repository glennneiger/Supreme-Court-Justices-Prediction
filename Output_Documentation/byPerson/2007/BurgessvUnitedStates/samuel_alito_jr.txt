justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i...
could
i
ask
you
what
you
think
congress
might
have
been
trying
to
do
with
the
1994
amendment
under...
under
your
reading?
before
1994
the
offense
had
to
be
classified
as
a
felony.
then
they
added
this
definition
of
"felony
drug
offense",
and
as
i
understand
it
your
reading
is
that
now
the
offense
must
be
classified
as
a
felony
and
it
must
be
punishable
by
more,
by
imprisonment
for
more
than
a
year.
what
would
be
the
reason
for
adding
this
new
requirement
as
you
see
it,
that
it
be
punishable
by
more
than
a
year,
if
there
were
not
offenses
that
were
classified
by
states
as
felonies
but
were
punishable
by
less
than
a
year?
i
can't
see
the
point
unless
the
point
was
to
rule
those
out.
and
you
haven't
cited
any
state
statute
in
your
brief
that
involved
an
offense
that
was
classified
as
a
felony
and
is
punishable
by
less
than
a
year.
you
cited
a
couple
that
were
punishable
by
exactly
a
year,
not
more
than
a
year
but
exactly
a
year.
so
is
it
your,
your
theory
that
the
reason
for
adding
this
new
language
was
to
make
it
clear
that
those
offenses
where
the
maximum
was
12
months,
as
opposed
to
12
months
and
a
day,
would
not
be
counted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
i
could
just
come
back
to
that.
i
looked
at
those.
you
cite
ohio,
north
carolina,
and
arizona
and
those
are
all
punishable
by...
they
all
have
a
maximum
term
of
12
months,
not
less
than.
so
the
difference
is
between
12
months
and
12
months
and
a
day?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
is
it
plausible
that's
the
reason
why
congress
added
this
language?
they
didn't
want...
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
these
felonies
that
were
punishable
by
just
12
months
would
not
be
counted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
you
do
with
someone
who
was
convicted...
had
a
prior
conviction
of...
for
importing
10
tons
of
heroin
in
new
jersey,
for
example,
where
there
are
no
felonies?
what
would
you
do
with
that,
a
very
serious
drug
offense
in
a
state
that
doesn't
use
the
term
"felony"
at
all
or
a
foreign
conviction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
they
did...
what
they
did
in
the
second
circuit
case
was
to
say
this
is
punishable...
this
offense
is
punishable
by
more
than
a
year
in
new
jersey
and
therefore
it's
a
felony.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
know.
and
that's
how
they
analogized
it
to
a
felony.
