chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-11429,
burgess
versus
united
states.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
the
rule
of
lenity
depends
upon
of
course
some
ambiguity
in
the
term,
the
definition
says
"1
year.
"
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
state
classification.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
obviously
one
is
a
definition
of
"felony"
and
the
other
is
the
definition
of
"felony
drug
offense"
and
the
term
that's
at
issue
here
is
"felony
drug
offense".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
on
that...
just
on
that
last
one,
are
you
saying
that
if
it
doesn't
say
"debtor's
residential
structure",
you'd
think
it
was
somebody
else's
residential
structure?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
a
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
code
that
deals
with
debtors
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
whose
residential
structure
they
would
be
talking
about,
even
though
they
don't
repeat
"debtor".
it
strikes
me
as
quite
different
than
the
provision
we
have
before
us
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's
such
a
vexing
problem,
why
would
congress
have
incorporated
the
problem
into
the
definition
of
"felony
drug
offense"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
seem
to
suggest
that
it's
a
vexing
problem
that
"felony"
is
defined
differently
in
different
states.
and,
yet,
you
say
that
the
term
"felony",
which
relies
on
how
it's
defined
by
different
states,
was
incorporated
in
the
felony
drug
offense,
which
seems
to
have
a
quite
clear
definition
of
punishable
by
more
than
one
year.
if
they
don't
want
to
repeat
the
problem
that
"felony"
is
defined
differently
in
different
states,
they
would
not
do
what
you're
suggesting,
which
is
incorporate
it
wholesale
into
the
latter
definition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
"drug"
a
nested
term
in
that?
it
doesn't
really
define
"drug".
do
they
look
somewhere
else
for
that
definition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
a
place
you
would...
is
that
a
place
you
would
look
if
you
didn't
know
what
they
meant
by
"drug"?
if
an
issue
arose
whether,
you
know,
a
natural
narcotic,
i
mean
is
that
a
drug
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
is
nested
in
this
definition,
"felony
drug
offense"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
your
friend's
argument
that
the
classification...
or
the
term,
more
than
one
year
or
less
than
one
year,
doesn't
always
have
to
do
with
how
serious
they
view
the
offense,
but
they
may
impose
a
sentence
of
more
than
one
year
to
allow
time
for
rehabilitation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
saharsky.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
the
case
is
submitted.
