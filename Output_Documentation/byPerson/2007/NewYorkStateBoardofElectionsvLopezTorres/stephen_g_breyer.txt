justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
theory
of
this,
i
take
it,
is
that,
just
as
you
said,
voters
elect
convention
delegates,
and
those
convention
delegates
choose
the
official
nominee,
say,
of
the
democratic
party.
so
that
nominee
goes
on
to
the
final
ballot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
then
of
the
fact
that
the
convention
delegates
when
they
meet
won't
let
people
who
would
like
the
position
of
the
judge
appear
before
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
how
are
the
delegates
to
find
out
the
qualifications?
in
other
words,
if
that's
the
intent
of
this
statute,
then
you
have
a
statute
that's
designed
on
the
one
hand
to
have
convention
delegates
who
will
choose,
and
on
the
other
hand
to
prevent
the
convention
delegates
from
finding
out
the
qualifications
of
the
different
applicants,
in
which
case
it
would
seem
to
be
a
statute
that
would
give
the
actual
power
of
selection
to
the
leader
or
the
chairman...
i
forget
the
title...
of
the
democratic
party.
and
i
don't
know
about
the
constitutionality
of
that
or
not.
in
other
words,
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you're
not
sure,
it's
difficult....
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean
i
don't
see
how
you
avoid
answering
justice
stevens's
hypothetical?
the
reason
i
think
you
have
to
answer
it
is
because
the
new
york
system
is
the
system
he
described
in
the
hypothetical,
with
a
safety
valve.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
safety
valve
being
that
the
party
leaders
cannot
just
choose
anybody.
i
mean,
if
it
looks
they're
going
to
choose
something
really
nutty,
then
there
will
be
opposition
to
these
delegates
and
something
will
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
have
leeway,
but
you
can't
go
too
far.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
like
that.
that's
why
i
say
you
have
to
answer
it.
if
you
feel
that
that's
so
terrible,
then
you
say
no,
the
constitution
forbids
that,
though
you'd
have
to
explain,
wouldn't
you,
why,
with
all
its
faults,
that
is
not
better
in
the
judgment
of
new
york
than
a
system
where
people
raise
$4
million
from
the
lawyers
in
order
to
run
for
office?
