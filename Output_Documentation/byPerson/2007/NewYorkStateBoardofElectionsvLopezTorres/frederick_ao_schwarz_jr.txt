mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
a
robust
record,
the
district
court,
confirmed
in
great
detail
by
the
second
circuit,
found
that
there
were
severe
burdens
placed
upon
insurgents
and
placed
upon
party
members
who
wished
to
band
together
to
support
a
candidate.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
two...
there
was
no
specific
finding
that
was
a
burden,
you're
correct.
i
have
two
additional
points
to
make.
first,
if
you
look
at
john
dunne's
amicus
brief,
john
dunne
was
a
republican
leader
in
the
state
of
new
york.
he
was
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
for
many
years
in
the
state
senate.
and
he
on
page
19
of
his
brief
describes
how
it
was
impossible
even
for
him
to
get
admitted
as
a
delegate,
and
it
wasn't
worthwhile
to
try
and
be
a
lone
gadfly.
secondly,
the
courts
analyzed
the
burden
in
terms
of
the
difficulty
of
assembling
and
running
a
slate
of
delegates,
a
slate
that
cut
across
the
various
assembly
districts,
and
the
court
found--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--well,
the--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--i...
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think
if
you
think
about
the
question
of
do
the
party
leaders
have
the
right
to
stifle
the
voices
of
ordinary
members,
one
should
conclude
no,
and
it's
very
different
from
your
decision
in
jones.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
okay.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
the
right
of
association
does
not
include
the
right
to
use
an
election
system
imposed
by
the
state
which
makes
it
impossible.
that's
where
the
burden
comes
from.
it's
because
the
state
has
imposed
this
system
on
every
party.
so
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
countervailing
right
on
the
other
side.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
in
the...
i
would
say
in
the
first
place
i'd
have
to
start
out
by
saying
there's
not
the
case
on
all
fours
like
this.
the...
then
i
would
say
that's
quite
clear
why
that
would
be,
because
there's
no
system
like
this
in
the
united
states
and
never
has
been.
the...
i
guess
i
would
say
after
that
point,
that
the
cases...
first,
there
are
principles
in
your
cases.
there's
a
principle
being
worried
about
the
effect
of
state
laws
serving
to
entrench
power.
that's
a
theme
that
runs
through
all
your
cases.
secondly,
there
is
in
your
cases
the...
many,
many
cases
that
hold
what's
important
is
to
make
a
realistic
assessment
of
how
a
statute
actually
works.
now,
having
said
those
two
points
by
way
of...
three
points
by
way
of
preliminary,
first,
there's
nothing
on
all
fours
and
really
you
wouldn't
expect
it,
then
what
are
cases
that
i
think
are...
that
bite
in
our
favor?
well,
there
are
principles
in
the
cases.
i
would
start
with
storer
and
storer
says
in
assessing
severe
burden
what
you
want
to
look
at
is
the...
is
the
realistic
effect
of
whether
people
have
gotten
on
the
ballot.
and
storer
says
if
you
find
that
happens
rarely,
while
it's
not
conclusive,
it's
the...
it's
indicative
that
there
is
a
severe
burden.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
well,
but
the
principles
of
whether
the
election,
general
election
cases
and
the
primary
cases
should
apply,
it
seems
to
me
are
the
same
principles.
the
root
principles
that
apply
are
the
same
ones.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
please.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
there
absolutely
is,
your
honor.
we
do
not
claim
here
that
any
convention
is
inappropriate.
conventions
are
appropriate.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
as
long
as
that
convention
does
not
set
up
severe
barriers
to
people
competing;
and
i
would
say
even
if
you
look
at
the
board
of
elections'
own--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--i
wouldn't
put
it
as
being
penalized,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
the--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--but
it's
what
we
seek
and
we
think
the
courts
below
appropriately
granted,
your
honor.
the...
but
it's
not
penalizing
the
state
for
doing
something;
it's
saying
if
do
you
this,
and
if
you
severely
burden,
as
after
an
extensive
fact-finding
hearing
the
court
held
the
statutes
do,
then
you
have
to
show
that
there's
a
compelling
justification.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
yeah.
i
guess
i
want
to
make
two
comments.
first,
it
seems
to
me
the
principles
that
are
in
your
direct
election
cases,
and
also
primary
cases
like
kusper
and
the
panish
v.
lubin
or
lubin
v.
panish,
where
the
court
took
the
language
in
your
williams
case
about
you
ought
to
be
worried
if
there
are
multiple
parties
competing,
clamoring
for
a
place
on
the
ballot,
and
said,
well,
that
should
also
apply...
this
court
said
that
should
also
apply
in
a
primary
context
where
there
are
multiple
people
seeking
to...
to
attain
a
nomination.
now,
should
it
matter
because
here
the
primary
or
the
election...
it's
really
an
election
but
the
state
happens
to
call
it
a
primary...
should
it
matter
that
that
is
in
the
preliminary
stage,
in
the
nomination
stage?
i
would
suggest
it
should
not.
now,
i
think
your--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--i
think
i
would
like
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
law
as
i
think
you've
described
it
and
a
different
law
that
justice
scalia
described.
i
think
the
law
that
justice
scalia
described
would
be
constitutional.
if
what
the
state
did
is
to
say,
you
the
party
decide
on
what
to
do,
i
think
the
state
is
then
not
putting
a
thumb
on
the
scale;
the
state
is
not
interfering
with
the
disputes
within
the
party.
however,
on
the
statute
that
i
think
you
described,
justice
souter,
where
the
state
says,
we
decree
that
for
every
party
the
leader
shall
make
the
decision,
i
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional
because
the
state
has
no
business
intervening
in
the--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--i'm
sure
the
party
likes
it.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
well,
the...
first,
on
the
consent
of
the
party
leaders,
which
is
really
what
we
have
here,
of
course
they
are...
they
like
the
system
because
the
state
system
entrenches
them.
and...
and
this
court--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--well,
because
the
federal
system
provides
that
there
shall
not
be
elections.
here
elections--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--well,
i
would
still
suggest,
your
honor,
that,
as
we
see
the
case
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
but
our
case
is
much
stronger
than
that
because,
in
any
event,
there
is
here
an
election
for
delegates.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
yes.
they
would
not
listen
to
her,
and
they
said:
we
won't
listen
to
you
in
this
particular
case;
we
won't
listen
to
you
because
you
declined
to
hire
an
unqualified
person
as
your
law
clerk.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
let
me
try
two
things.
first,
that
never
has
worked.
and
it...
it
has
to
be...
at
least
using
the
storer
analysis
of
what
actually
happens,
the
fact
that
never
in
the
history
of
new
york,
not
in
the
republican
party,
not
in
the
democratic
party,
not
in
new
york
city,
not
in
upstate,
never
has
someone
who
was
opposed
by
the
party
boss
been
able
to
become
a
judge.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
but
the...
you
know,
this
isn't
an
issue
that
divides
by
ideology.
it's...
really,
the
question
here
is
if
you
have
a
statute
that
makes
it
difficult
for
the
voters
to
participate,
to
have
a
voice.
that's
really
the
question.
and
if
i
could
use
something
that
the
board
of
elections'
brief
conceded
in
both
their
reply
and
their
opening
brief,
they
said
a
person...
they
said
that
party
members
who
wanted
to
attempt
to
assemble
a
slate
to
try
to
influence
the
decision
at
the
convention
would
be
"well
served"...
that's
their
exact
words...
to
assemble
and
run
a
slate.
but
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
found
that
it
was
impossible...
severely
burdensome,
actually
impossible...
for
that
burden
to
be
met.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
if
it
said
delegates
will
be
selected--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i'm
not...
i
think
that...
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
it's
different
than
justice
souter's
hypothetical.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
have
a
position
on
that
one
way
or
the
other.
what
i
do
say,
though,
is
this
court
in
your
minnesota
republican
party
v.
white
decision
said
it
makes...
and,
you
know,
the
question
of
whether
judges
should
be
elected
or
appointed
is
a
controversial
question.
but
this
court
in
that
decision
said
that
if
you're
going
to
have
an
election...
and
here
we
have
elections
for
delegates...
if
you're
going
to
have
an
election,
you
shouldn't
structure
that
election
in
a
way
that
makes
it
in
that
case
extremely
difficult
or
impossible
or
forbidden--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--well,
the...
i
do
believe
that
the
election
of
the
delegates
raises
the
constitutional
questions
about
has
the
state
put
its
thumb
on
the
scale,
has
the
state
done
something
that
severely
burdens
the
voters.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
well,
i
think
here
it
is
the
right
not
to
be
burdened,
severely
burdened,
in
an
election.
and
that
just
runs
through
all
your
cases--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--we
have
never
said
that
there's
a
right
to
win.
we
have
only
said
there's
a
right
to
meaningfully
participate.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
no.
it's
a
compete
argument,
not
an
access
argument.
and
i
do
think
the
constitution
should
be
read
to
say
that
if
the
state
passes
laws
that
make
it
very
hard
for
voters
to
band
together
or
for
insurgent
candidates
to
compete,
then...
and
it
is
a
severe
burden,
they
have
to
justify
it.
and,
by
the
way,
they
haven't
sought
in
their
papers
to
justify
it.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
the
problem
is
that
in
the
real
world
the
statutes
work
to
entrench
the
power
of
the
party
leaders
and
to
prevent
voters
from,
to
use
the
board
of
elections'
reply
brief,
i
think,
on
page
5,
to
use...
or
17,
to
use...
the
voters
are
not
able
to
band
together
to
try
and
influence
the
results
at
the
conventions.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
we...
we
have
no
problem
with
the
convention,
but
we
don't
think
that
the...
either
the
insurgent
candidate
or
the
band
of
voters
who
wish
to
support
that
person
should
be,
by
the
state,
fenced
out,
severely
burdened
from
attempting
to--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
no,
that's...
that's
not--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
if
you
want...
if
we
want
to
call
that
fencing.
i
don't
call
that
fencing.
that's
the...
if
the
convention
is
one
that
is
put
together
without
the
state
burdening
the
ability
for
people
to
get
involved--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--i
think
you
should
also
look
at
the...
since
the
party
leaders
run
slates
and
they
have
no
difficulty
in
running
slates
because...
for
various
reasons
that
the
courts
found,
i
think
you
should
look
at
the
question
of
slates
as
well
as
individual
delegates.
and
in
considering
individual
delegates,
i
do
think
that
mr.
dunne's
amicus
brief
which
describes,
on
his
page
19,
indicates
that,
you
know,
it's...
it's
a
little
unrealistic
to
think
that
anybody
other
than--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--no,
he
wasn't--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--he
wasn't
trying
to
be
a
judge,
your
honor.
he...
he
speaks
about
his
desire
to
be
a
delegate
and
his
being
told
that,
you're
not
sufficiently
reliable;
we're
not
going
to
let
you
be
a
delegate.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
if
he
wanted
to
be
a
single
person
running...
appearing
as
a
gadfly--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--he
needs
the
500
signatures.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
i
think
we
have
a
difficult
case,
if
you
don't
think
that's
sufficient
burden.
if
you
think--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--no,
i...
i'm
not...
i'm
agreeing
with
the
chief
justice
that
i
think
that,
if
you
thought
that
just
running
for
one
delegate
slot
was
sufficient
to
solve
the
problem
of
a
state
statute
that
was
designed...
their
words,
their
admission...
to
entrench
the
power
of
the
party
leaders,
i
think
that
gives
us
a
problem.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
the
safety
valve
being?
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
well--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--the
record,
your
honor,
and
this
is
an
extensive
record,
shows
that
the
party
leaders
can
choose
and
do
choose
people
who
are,
to
use
your
word,
who
are--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--we...
no,
we...
we
have
not
said
that
there
needs
to
be
a
primary.
we
haven't
said
that.
and
sometimes
our
opponents
leave
the
impression
that
we
have
said
that.
you
know,
there
are...
get
rid
of
the
leaders--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--yes,
the...
but
the
judge,
your
honor...
the
judge
did
two
things
in
imposing
that
remedy,
three
or
four
things
actually:
he
said,
first,
i'm
not
going
to
micromanage.
i
think
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional.
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
all
the
details
of
fixing
it
because
the
legislature
should
do
that
and
the
federal
courts
shouldn't
do
that.
second,
he
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
fall-back
position
in
the
state
statutes
is
there
is
a
primary
if
there
is
no
other
system
in
place.
but,
third
and
most
important,
he
stayed
his
decision
to
give
the
legislature
time
to
address
the
question,
and
they
were
well
on
their
way
to
addressing
it
when
this
court
gave
us
the
opportunity
to
be
here.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
no,
they...
they're
entitled
to
do
that.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
well,
the--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--if
you
look
at
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
our
favor,
the
state
bar,
the
city
bar,
the
fund
for
the
modern
courts,
the
city
of
new
york
all
filed
a
brief
in
which
they
say,
we
think
the
right
solution
is
to
have
an
appointive
system,
and
they're
working
to
try
to
have
that
happen.
and
the
governor
has
put
forward
a
bill
for
an
appointive
system.
but,
they
say--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--no,
not--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--no,
it
could
be
a
role
for
the
voters
that
does
not
burden
them
in
the
way
this
statute
burdens
them.
and
the...
that
brief
by
the
state
bar
and
the
bar
of
the
association
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
other
groups
who
are
strongly
in
favor
of
an
appointive
system,
say
to
this
court,
this
is
the
worst
of
all
worlds.
and
it...
this
system,
as
also
the
amicus
brief
from
the
former
judges
who
were
responsible
for
appellate
judges
responsible
for
administering
the
new
york
state
system,
says
that
this
system
has
undermined
judicial
independence
and
undermined
confidence
in
the
courts.
and
that
is...
you
know...
that
is
clearly
correct--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--yes,
the...
actually
the
feerick
report,
which
found
that
the
party
leaders
all
over
state
however
have
always
made
the
picks,
they
voiced
a
favoring
amending
the
law.
they...
they
think
the
law
needs
to
be
amended.
and
chief
judge
kaye,
in
her
remarks
after
the
decisions
came
down
and
after
the
feerick
commission
report
came
out,
said
the
problems
that
had
been
revealed
in
this
case
are
pervasive
both
systemically
and
geographically.
the
feerick
commission's
view
is
that,
unless
there's
public
financing,
in
which
case
they'd
favor
some
more
involvement
by
the
voters,
is
simply
amend
the
portions
of
the
law
that
make
it
so
burdensome
on
competitors,
on
voters.
we're...
we're
neutral.
we
just
say
this
law
is
unconstitutional.
and
how
it
should
be
amended
is
up
to
the
legislature,
but
that
it
should
be
amended
is...
there's
a
powerful
case
and,
you
know,
i
don't
know
where
i
am
on
the
time
here,
but
i
commend
to
you
the
various
amicus
briefs
that
have
come
in
on--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--no,
they
also
speak--
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
--speak
about
the
constitution,
and,
indeed,
it's
not
very
often
that
you
find,
on
a
constitutional
issue,
both
the
washington
legal
foundation
and
the
aclu
coming
in,
as
they
have
come
in,
to
assert
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
statute.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
yes,
but
then
i...
i
think
you
should
look
at
the...
what
you've
said
in...
not
you,
but
your
predecessor
said
in
eu,
about
we've
never
held
that
a
political
party's
consent
will
cure
a
statute
that
otherwise
is
violative
and,
there
are
other
quotes
in
justice
scalia's
tashjian
opinion
and
in...
in
several
other
cases
to
that
effect.
mr.
frederick
a.o.
schwarz,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
olson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
