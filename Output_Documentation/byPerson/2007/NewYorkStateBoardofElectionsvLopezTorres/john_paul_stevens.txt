well,
what
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--didn't
justice
kennedy
asked
if
the
kusper
case
was
correctly
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
schwarz.
supposing
that
the
statute
did
not
contain
the
delegate-selection
process
and
instead,
said:
delegates
shall
be
selected
by
the
county
chairman
in
each
county
and
by
the
organization.
would
it
then
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
party
officials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
saying
just
eliminate
this
whole
folderol
about
picking
delegates
and
say
the
county
chairman
shall
pick
the
delegates,
period.
i
don't
see
why
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schwarz,
you're
talking
about
the
election
of
the
judge
or
the
election
of
the
delegate?
i
think
you're
mixing
two
oranges
and
apples
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it...
the
evidence
shows
the
thumb
on
the
scale
is
just
as
strong
as
if
the
party
chairman
picked
the
delegates.
and,
therefore,
it
seems
to
me,
it
presents
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
enact
a
statute
that
allows
the
party
chairman
to
pick
the
delegates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
all
policy
arguments
about
why
this
is
a
terrible
statute.
they're
not
necessarily
constitutional
arguments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
a
vast
difference.
