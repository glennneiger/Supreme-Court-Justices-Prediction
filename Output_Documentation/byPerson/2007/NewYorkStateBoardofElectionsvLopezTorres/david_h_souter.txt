justice
david
h.
souter
the,
the
problem
that
i
have
in
the
analogy
you
are
drawing
on
the
application
of
your
principle
based
on
the
general
election
cases
is
this:
there
is
concededly...
and
you
mentioned
this
earlier...
there
is
concededly
no
unreasonable
barrier
to
somebody
who
wants
to
become
a
delegate.
he's
got
to
get
500
signature,
but
that
can
be
done.
the
burden
that
i
understand
that
your
clients
are
complaining
about
is
the,
in
effect,
the
burden
of
influencing
the
ultimate
decision-maker
to
decide
to
nominate
that
person.
and
that
burden
is...
is
focused
on
two
points:
number
one,
the
entrenched
power
of
the
political
bosses;
and
number
two,
the
difficulty...
well,
i
guess
three
points...
the
difficulty
of
fielding,
for
a
dissident
to
field
a
whole
slate
of
candidates
who
in
effect,
once
elected,
would
make
the
nomination
desired;
or,
three,
the
capacity
of
the
intending
or
the
aspiring
candidate
to
influence
the
delegates
directly
once
they're
selected,
because
the
time
is
short.
and
those
aren't...
those
aren't,
it
seems
to
me,
complaints
about
access
to
the
electoral
process.
they're
complaints
about
the
capacity
to
influence
those
who
are
elected,
who
make
the
ultimate
decision.
and
that's
the
difficulty
i
have
in
the
analogy
that
you
are
drawing
or
the
parallel
that
you
are
making
between
the
direct
election
cases
and
your
claim
here.
could
you
comment
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
still
the
case
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
nub
of
your
claim
is
that
the
intending
judicial
candidate
cannot
effectively
politic,
does
not
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
getting
selected;
and
i
don't
see
that
as
a...
as
a
direct
ballot
access
claim.
let
me
put
the
question
in
another
way:
your...
your
friend
on
the
other
side,
mr.
rossman,
in
response
to
a
question,
said
that
if
this
election
of
the
judicial
candidate
for
the
party
were
made
directly
by
the
political
bosses,
whatever
their
titles
are,
the
ones
who
are
supposedly
in
control
here,
he
would
not
see
any
constitutional
objection
to
that.
what
if
new
york
had
a
system
that
provided
precisely
for
that?
the
political
bosses,
as
i
understand
it,
get
elected
every
2
years
and
the
state
law
would
provide
that
those
party
bosses,
whatever
their
title
is,
would
in
fact
select
the
candidate.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
party
isn't
objecting.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
party...
the
party
likes
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
are
the...
the
claim
here:
these
people
are
not,
as
i
understand
it,
bringing
a
case
on
behalf
of
rights
of
the
party.
they're
bringing
a
case
based
on
a
premise
of
a
principle
of
participation,
which
is
theirs.
and
that's
why,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
hypo
that
i
posed
is
not
significantly
different,
provided
the
parties
aren't
objecting,
in
which
we
have
a
different
case.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
my
hypo
is
not
significantly
different
from
the
one
that
gave
rise
to
the
question
that
mr.
rossman
answered.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
federal
system
in
practice
entrenches
united
states
senators.
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that,
in
terms
of
political
participation
on
the
part
of
an
intending
or
an
aspiring
judge
that
the
system
that
i
suggested
in
the
hypo,
in
which
the
party
bosses
select
the
nominee,
is
for
constitutional
purposes
significantly
different
from
the
federal
system
for...
for
picking
district
judges.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
and
in
my
hypo
the
only
election
is
the
election
for
the
party
boss.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
isn't
your
argument
still
that,
because
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
participation
of
the
intending
judicial
candidate,
there
is
ultimately
a
constitutional
problem?
so
let
me
pose
a
different
question
to
you,
and
this
one
is
not
hypothetical.
the
nub
of
your
case
is
that
the
political
bosses
in
effect
are
controlling
the
process
because
they
tell
the
delegates
who
to
vote
for.
does
your...
does
the
intending
judicial
nominee
whom
you
represent
have
any
difficulty
in
getting
to
the
political
bosses
and
saying:
i
want
you
to
consider
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
they...
for
political
reasons,
they're
saying:
we
don't
like
you.
there
are...
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
go
to
united
states
senators,
and
the
united
states
senators
say:
scram;
we
don't...
we
don't
like
you;
your
politics
aren't
good
enough
for
us.
and
so
i'm
not
saying
that...
that...
on
my
hypo
the
person
who
lobbies
the
bosses
directly
is...
is
claiming
a
right
to
success.
i
think
they're
claiming
a
right
to
have
a
chance
to
influence
the
process.
and
why
don't
they
have
the
chance
by
going
to
the
boss?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
don't
know
of
any
enemy
of
a
united
states...
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
what
you
are
calling...
and
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
maybe
i
misunderstand
this.
i
think
what
you
are
calling
the
severe
burden
is
the
difficulty
of
assembling
a
whole
slate
that
can
control
the
meeting
or
have
a
majority
in
the
ultimate
meeting
of
that
delegate,
of
those
delegates,
and
therefore
actually
select
the
candidate
who
wants
to
put
the
slate
together.
and
it's
control
over
result
rather
than
the
capacity
of
any
individual
to
get
elected
a
delegate
which
i
think
you
are
objecting
to.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
when
you
say
"meaningfully
participate"
you
talk
about
putting...
and
candidly
talk
about
putting...
a
slate
of
delegates
together.
if
i
put
a
slate
of
delegates
together,
it
is
because
once
those
delegates
are
selected
they're
going
to
support
me;
and
that's
why
it...
i
think
your
real
argument
is
not
that
somebody
has
difficulty
becoming
a
candidate
for
a
delegate
or
even
getting
elected
one.
the
difficulty
that
you're
claiming
is
that
it's
hard
for
the
intending
judicial
candidate
to
assemble
a
large
enough
group
of
people
to
give
that
candidate
success
once
the
delegates
are
elected.
it's
a
success
argument
that
you
are
making,
not
an
access
argument.
