assuming
that
the
plaintiffs
have
associational
rights
at
stake
here,
isn't
this
a
case
where
there's
a
conflict
between
two
associational...
two
sets
of
rights
of
association?
you
have
the
party
hierarchy
who
wants
to,
in
your
own
words,
fence
out
the
insurgents.
that's
a
right
not
to
associate.
and
then
you
have
the
insurgents
who
want
to
be
fenced
in?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
different
from
the
cases
that
you
rely
on?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
charged
language:
they
have
the
right
to
stifle.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
insurgents,
do
they
not...
does
not
the
right
of
association
include
the
right
not
to
associate?
