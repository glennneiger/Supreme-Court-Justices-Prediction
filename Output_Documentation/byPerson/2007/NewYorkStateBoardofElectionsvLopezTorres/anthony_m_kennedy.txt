just
focus
on,
if
you
would,
mr.
olson,
on
the
election
for
the
delegates.
now,
suppose
it
were
shown...
a
hypothetical
case...
that
it's
extremely
difficult
to
get
on
that
ballot.
you
need,
let's
say,
2,000
signatures
in
30
days.
would
there
be
a
constitutional
issue
raised
by
that
situation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
hypothetical
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
kusper,
the
kusper
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
we
have
made
it
very
clear
that
if
you're
going
to
use
a
primary
system,
you
can't
have
such
burdensome
registration
requirements
that
the
primary
system
is
not,
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
to
all
intents
and
purposes
open
to
those
who
wish
to
participate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
that
in
kusper,
if...
if
there
was
reasonable
access
to
a
general
election,
you
can
structure
and
stifle
the
primary
any
way--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
just
looking
at
the
principle
here,
and
it
may
be
that
you'll
say
that
there's
no
burden
here,
et
cetera.
but
i
just
want
to
know:
isn't
there
a
constitutional
principle
that
we
are
entitled
and
we
must
look
at
the
fairness
of
the
primary
system
insofar
as
participation
of
the
voters?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
make
it
clear,
is
it
your
position
that,
with
reference
to
this
election
for
delegates,
the
state
can
make
it
as
burdensome
as
it
chooses
on
those
who
wish
to
put
themselves
forward
on
the
ballot
as
a
proposed
delegate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
there
is
a
state-mandated
primary,
i
thought
it's
basic
law
that
the
state
may
not
place
unduly
restrictive
barriers
to
participation
in
that
primary.
i
think
that's
a
given,
it
seems
to
me.
now,
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
then
we
can
argue
about
whether
the
burden
is
too
great
here,
which
it
may
not
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
a
political
party
could
say,
you
can't
vote
in
our
primary
unless
you've
been
a
member
of
our
party
for
4
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
would
be
a
state-mandated
party
primary
for--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--election--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
burden
on
a
single
delegate
wanting
to
be
on
the
ballot?
i
think
that
requires
500
votes,
and
there
was
no
specific
finding
that
that
was
burden,
was
there?
or
am
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
your...
what
are
you
best
cases
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
could
interrupt,
justice
breyer,
for
just
a
moment.
but
in
the
minnesota
case
the
thumb
on
the
scale
was
to
deprive
the
constituents
of
a
first
amendment
right.
smith
v.
allwright,
it
was
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
race.
here
what
we're
asking
is:
what
is
the
substantive
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
state...
the
trial
court
didn't
find
that
that
was
a
burden.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
the
state,
your
mean
the
state
statute?
