that
convention...
conventions
can
come
in
all
sizes
and
shapes.
the
argument
here
is
that
this
system
shuts
out
rank-and-file
party
members
and
gives
the
total
control
to
the
party
leaders,
and
that
the
preliminary
was
the
primary
or
selection
of
delegates,
but
it's
really
a
sham
because
nobody
is
going
to
run
for
that
except
the
party
faithful,
someone
picked
by
the
party
boss.
so
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
this
system,
as
complicated
as
it
is,
reduces
to
the
party
leaders
choose
the
candidates.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
party
is...
you're
identifying
the
party
with
the
party
leader
because
the
argument
comes
down
to
this
is
not
the
rank
and
file
that's
making
this
election;
this
is
the
party
leader;
and
the
party
might
like
that
or
the
leadership
might
like
that,
but
the
rank
and
file
might
not,
and
the
argument
is
that
they
have
rights
of
association,
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
practice,
how
many
people
other
than
the
slate
selected
by
the
party
leaders
run
in
new
york
for
this
delegate
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
autonomy
of
the
party
and,
let's
say,
the
leader
is
the
justification
for
this,
the
party...
how...
how
autonomous
can
a
party
be
when
it's
told,
even
if
you
want
to
be
more
democratic
about
how
you
choose
your
candidates,
you
can't
because
new
york
is
forcing
this
system
on
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
storer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could
a
state
decide
it
doesn't
want
candidates
to
have
any
part
in
this
delegate-selection
process?
it
thinks
it's
unseemly
to
have
would-be
judges
engage
in
that
kind
of
activity.
so
it
structures
the
system
that
says
that
they
choose
delegates
for
a
convention,
but
we
don't
want
those
delegates
to
be
the
delegates
of
any
particular
candidate.
we
want
to
insulate
this
process
from
would-be
candidate
influence.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the...
that's
the
remedy
that,
the
temporary
remedy,
that
you
sought
was...
at
the
bottom
line,
the
court's
order
was,
until
new
york
reacts
to
this
decision,
the
candidates
will
be
chosen
by
primary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
also
one
view,
i
think
it
was,
in
the
feerick
report
that
said,
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
would
be
to
return
us
to
the
primary
system
this
system
was
intended
to
replace.
