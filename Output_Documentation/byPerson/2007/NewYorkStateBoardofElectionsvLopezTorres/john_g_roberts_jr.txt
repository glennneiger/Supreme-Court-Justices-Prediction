chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-766,
new
york
state
board
of
elections
v.
torres.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
right
to
regard
the
election
of
delegates
here
as
a
primary
election?
my
understanding,
of
course,
is
that
that
simply
elects...
it
doesn't
get
you
on
the
ballot.
it
elects
delegates
who
then
exercise
the
choice.
do
you
think
our
primary
election
cases
are
transferable
to
this
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
rossman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
that
the
state
can
make
the
judgment
that
it's
more
likely
that
the
delegates
would
be
informed
about
the
qualifications
of
candidates
for
judgeship
than
voters?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
rossman.
mr.
schwarz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
a
general
election
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you
about
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
suppose
the
state
doesn't
think
that
direct
voter
election
of
judges
is
a
good
idea,
that
it
thinks
there
ought
to
be
some
insulation
to
avoid
the
problems
of
judges
campaigning
and
raising
money
and
all
that;
yet,
at
the
same
time
they
want
some
participation
by
the
voters
in
the
process.
is
there
any
way
they
can
achieve
that
objective,
to
have
the
nominees
actually
chosen
not
by
the
voters
but
by
a
convention,
and
yet
have
some
role
by
the
voters?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
just
asking
is
there
a
way
to
have
a
convention
with
some
role
by
the
voters
or
the
party--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
doesn't
that
seem
kind
of
odd,
that
if
a
state
can
have
no
role
for
voters,
it
can
have
a
pure
convention,
that
they're
penalized
if
they
have
some
role
for
voters?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
being
found
unconstitutional
is
a
pretty
severe
penalty.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
all
right,
i
take
it,
if
they
don't
prevail?
for
example--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
other
side
says
that
your
argument
is...
is
implicated
whenever
a
convention
leads
to
a
different
nominee
than
the
primary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
the
convention
deciding
that
the
nominee
is
going
to
be
someone
other
than
the
person
who
would
prevail
in
the
primary
election.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
all
right
to
fence
them
out
to
that
extent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
it,
in
evaluating
the
burden,
we
should
look
at
how
difficult
it
is
for
someone
to
be
elected
a
delegate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
that
because
mr.
dunne
was
not
supported
by
the
party
members
at
the
convention--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--for
whatever
higher
office--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
did
he
have
to
do
to
become
on
the
ballot
for
delegate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
500
signatures,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
we
don't
think
that's
a
sufficient
burden,
do
you
lose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
it's
not
realistic
that
one
way
they
would
address
it
is
by
having
an
entirely
appointed
system?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
they
are
entitled
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
a
practical
matter,
is
that
a
realistic
option
in
new
york?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
he
has.
i
mean
that's
in
his
interest.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
i
read
a
representation
somewhere
in
the
briefs
that
it's
unrealistic
to
expect
that
new
york
would
move
to
an
entirely
appointive
system.
so
that
the
options,
if
you're
successful,
the
options
will
either
be
direct
election
of
judges
or
a
pure
convention
with
no
role
for
the
voters
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
not
often
you
have
both
the
democratic
party
and
the
republican
party...--
[laughter]
--supporting
it
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
schwarz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
