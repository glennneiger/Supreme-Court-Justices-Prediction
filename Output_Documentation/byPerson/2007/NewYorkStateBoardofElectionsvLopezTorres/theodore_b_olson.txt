mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
10
years,
new
york
relied
on
political
party
primaries
to
nominate
general
election
candidates
for
supreme
court
justice,
but
that
process
discouraged
qualified
candidates
and
spawned
unseemly,
expensive,
and
potentially
corrupting
fundraising
by
judicial
candidates.
so
the
legislature
substituted
an
indirect
party
primary
system
at
which
delegates
are
elected
who,
in
turn,
select
general
election
candidates
at
political
party
conventions.
the
second
circuit
concluded
that
the
delegate
convention
statutes
enabled
political
parties
to
exercise
too
much
influence
at
the
expense
of
the
insurgent
party
members
or
insurgent
candidates
and
struck
those
statutes
down
as
facially
unconstitutional
and
reinstated
the
discredited
primary
process.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
delegate-convention
system
is
facially
unconstitutional
because
it
allows
party
leaders
to
defeat
the
aspirations
of
party
insurgents.
states
have
broad,
as
this
case
has
repeatedly
held...
broad
constitutional
latitude
to
prescribe
the
time,
place,
and
manner
of
elections,
particularly
elections
for
state
office.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
in
the
first
place,
as
you
know,
justice
kennedy,
that...
that
is
not
the
case
here.
it
takes
500
signatures--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
it
were
an
impossible
burden
to
get
on
the
ballot,
i
still
don't
think
that
first
amendment
associational
rights
would
be
involved.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
think
the
kusper
case
goes
that
far,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that,
as
the
cases
of
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
the
other
factor
that
is
involved
here
is
that,
provided
that
there
is
reasonable
access
to
the
general
election,
which
is
another
factor
in
this
case,
then
the
constitutional
rights
to
associate
are
satisfied.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
the
case
that
maybe
best
answers
that
is
the
munro
case,
in
which
the
state
of
washington's
practice...
and
there
was
a
different
practice
of
the
state
of
washington
before
this
court
earlier
this
week.
but
at
that
point
in
time
the
process
was
that
there
was
an
open
blanket
primary,
which
was
not
held
unconstitutional
at
that
point,
where
the
major
candidates...
the
one
and
two
positions
of
the
major
candidates
of
each
of
the
political
parties
would
get
on
the
ballot,
and
then
the
socialist
party
was
complaining
because
it
took
1
percent
of
the
votes
of
the
primary
process
to
get
on
the
general
election
ballot.
this
court
held
that
that...
that
that
was
not
an
impossible
burden,
and
that...
the
principle
from
that
case
and
the
other
cases,
the
american
political...
american
party
of
texas
v.
white
and
so
forth,
the
court's
jurisprudence
has
held
that,
as
long
as
there
is
reasonable
access
for
a
candidate
or
a
political
party
to
the
general
election
process,
then
it
does
not
have
to
be
provided
in
that
level
in
the
primary.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
your
primary
election
cases
talk
in
terms
of,
the
ones
that
have
been
mentioned
in
the
briefs
here,
talk
particularly
in
terms
of
protection
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
this
is...
it's
called
a
primary,
but
it's
an
election
of
delegates
by
party
members
that...
and
then,
when
those
delegates
get
together,
they
go
to
the
convention.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
the
nomenclature
makes
so
much
difference
as
this
is
a
process
that
the
state
has
allowed
the
party
to
implement
to
choose
its
leadership.
the
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
there
is
no
point
in
the
process--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
the
state
requires
it,
but
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
the
principle
that
the
respondents
in
the
second
circuit
advance.
it
would
strike
down
the
conventions,
because
conventions
are,
by
definition,
selections
of
individuals
to
represent
the
broader
constituency
at
a
subsequent--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think,
justice
kennedy,
as
long
as
the
system
in
the
state
provides
a
reasonable
access
to
candidates
and
political
parties
to
the
election
process,
that
there
is
not
a
first
amendment
right
with
respect
to
the
primary
process
or
the
preliminary
process,
which
in
this
case
includes
both
the
so-called
delegate
selection
primary--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
clear
the
state
has
the
right,
and
this
court
has
said
so
in
the
american
party
of
texas
v.
white,
that
the
state
can
require
either
a
primary
election
or
a
convention.
the
court
specifically
addressed
that.
in
fact,
what
the
court
said:
it
is
too
plain
for
argument
that
a
state
may
insist
that
intraparty
competition
be
settled
by
primary
or
convention.
that's
the
holding
of
that
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
california
republican
party
v.
jones
case,
a
cite
quoting
the
eu
case,
the
eu
case
that
the
court
had
decided
before,
is
that
the
political
party
has
the
right
to
select
its
leadership,
to
select
its
nominating
process,
to
select
its
candidates,
and
to
exclude
members.
so,
justice
ginsburg,
the
party
has
the
right,
even
arbitrarily,
as
long
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
violated
in
an
election
context,
to
exclude
members
of
its
party.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
by
primary
or...
or
by
convention.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
right.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
can,
justice
scalia,
but
the
state
must
respect
the
rights
of
the
political
parties
in
determining
who
their
leaders
and
candidates
must
be.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
i
totally
agree
with
you.
but
i'm
answering
hypothetical
questions
with
respect
to
something
else.
what
this
court
has
said,
that
this
court
vigorously
protects
the
special
place
the
first
amendment
reserves
for
the
protection
by
which
a
party,
political
party,
selects
a
standard-bearer.
selecting
a
candidate
is
selecting
the
person
that
will
communicate
the
party's
interests--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
they
have
rights
of
association,
but
they
have...
they
have
associated
in
a
political
party
which
has
elected
leadership
which
makes
decisions,
justice
ginsburg.
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
belong
to
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party.
the
rank
and
file,
so
forth...
the
definition
of
"insurgent",
which
is
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
here,
are
people
that
are
rebelling
against
the
duly
elected
leadership
of
the
political
party.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
may
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--let
me
say,
justice
kennedy,
that
i
may
be
wrong
in
terms
of
what
this
court's
decisions
stand
for
with
respect
to
ultimately
allowing,
as
far
as
associational
rights
are
concerned,
individuals
and
parties
access
to
the
total
electorate.
but
even
if
your
premise
is
correct
that
there
must
be
an
open
access
in
a
reasonable
way
to
either
the...
to
both
the
primary
and
the
general
election,
then
this
process
is
reasonable.
it's
not
unreasonably
difficult
for
a
person
to
participate.
let
me
say...
let
me
enumerate
the
ways.
an
individual,
a
rank-and-file
member,
can
campaign
and
vote
for
delegates.
an
individual
might
become
a
delegate
himself
by...
or
herself,
by
getting
500
names
on
a
signature,
and
that's
far
below
what
this
court
has
indicated
before
was...
was
an
acceptable
level
of
requirement
of
access
to
the
ballot.
an
individual
can
attempt
to
form
delegate
slates,
can
attempt
to
persuade
the
delegates,
can...
the
individual
can
form
or
switch
parties.
in
this
case
the
respondent
lopez
torres,
actually
in
the
2003
election,
became
a
candidate
at
the
general
election
for
supreme
court
justice
of
the
working
families
party,
and
she
did
that
without
giving
up
her
registration
and
membership
in
the
democratic
party.
she
was
in
that
election
and
she
lost.
finally,
and
this
is
even
if
she
hadn't
been
able
to
secure
the
nomination
of
that
political
party,
she
could
run
in
the
general
election.
there's
access
to...
it
takes
3500
to
4,000
signatures
to
run
as
an
independent
body
in
the
general
election.
so
there
is
way
after
way
after
way
for
individuals
in
new
york
to
participate
in
the
election
process.
so
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
to
the
extent
that
your
statement
of
the
principle
with
respect
to
access
to
both
the
primary
and
the
general
election
is...
is
the
law
of
this
court,
then
that
access
exists
here.
but
i
come
back
to
the
point
that
political
parties
have
the
greatest
possible
latitude...
yes,
justice
scalia,
that
the
court
has
upheld
certain
restrictions
with
respect
to
how
the
nominee
of
the
party
gets
selected.
but
the
court
has
also
said
that
when
the
party
is
in
that
process,
its
powers
and
rights
and
first
amendment
freedoms
to
elect
the
standard-bearer,
to
select
the
standard-bearer,
are
at
their
apogee,
because
the
person
selected
as
a
candidate,
whether
that
person
might
be
the
most
favorable
person
to
the
rank
and
file,
the
duly
elected
leadership
of
the
political
party
might
decide,
well,
that
person
really
isn't
qualified
to
be
a
supreme
court
justice
even--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--except
in
the
context
of
analyzing
what
state
requirements
have
been?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
aside--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
the
only
cases--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
only
cases
that
i
would
submit,
that
i'm
aware
of,
that
would
answer
that
would
be
equal
protection
clause
cases,
because
the...
these...
the
political
party
is
a
group
of
people
that
decide
to
form
together
because
of
common
beliefs.
in
the...
that
is
the
maximum
freedom
that
we
allow
for
associations.
with
all
the
business
about
smoke-filled
rooms
and
things
like
that,
people
have
the
right
to
decide,
make
decisions--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
i...
i
don't...
in
an
association--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
a
party
might--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--a
party
would...
there's
two
questions
there.
if
the
party
wants
to
have
a
4-year
requirement
before
you
can
be
a
part
of
that
association,
i
can't
understand
what
the
first
amendment
associational
right
would
be.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
the
state
imposed
that,
the
party
could
say,
well,
that's
unreasonable;
we
want
to
open...
in
fact,
the
court
decided
this
by
saying
that
the...
the
party
who
wanted
to
could
allow
independents
to
vote.
if
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i'm
not...
i
think
i
tried
to
answer
that
the
best
i
could
by
saying
that
i
think
the
import
of
the
cases,
without
getting
into
the
specifics
of
that,
are
that
if
you
have
a
reasonable
access
by
individuals
or
political
parties
to
the
electoral
process,
that
satisfies
the
constitution.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
second
circuit
reinstalled
what
the
new
york
legislature
found
to
be
a
bad
system,
that
it
discouraged
qualified
candidates
and
it
encouraged
this
unfortunate,
unseemly
race
for
money.
the
respondents
just
said
that
that
is
not
what
they
were
interested
in
doing,
but
their
prayer
for
their
relief,
on
page
35
of
their
complaint,
calls
for
a
direct
primary
election
for
the
supreme
court.
with
respect
to
the
kusper
case,
justice
kennedy,
i
gave
that
a
little
bit
more
thought.
that...
that
case
focused
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
inhibiting
the
rights
of
an
individual
who
wanted
to
participate
in
a
way
that
the
party
wanted
that
individual
to
participate.
that
long
period
of
time
prevented
both
the
individual
and
the
association
from
associating
together,
which
is
why--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
but...
and
to
the
extent
that
it
was...
it
was...
part
of
that
is
answered
by
your
clingman
case
which
just
came
relatively
recently,
where
the
party
wanted
independents
to
vote
in
the
primary
and
the
supreme
court...
this
court
said
that
the
state
had
to
let
that
happen.
with
respect
to
time
periods
between
when
you
had
to
identify
yourself
as
a
party
member
this
court
held
in
the
rosario
case
that
a
certain
length
of
time
is
appropriate
under
the
system.
with
respect
to
mr.
dunne,
we've
heard
about
him.
he
may
have
had
a
desire
to
be
a
delegate
but
he
never
tried
to
get
the
500
signatures.
it
says
that
right
on
his...
on
page
19
of
his
brief...
the
brief
that
my
colleague
was
quoting.
with
respect
to
the
questions
that
i
think
both
justice
stevens
and
justice
souter
were
asking,
could
the
state
lodge
the
candidate
selection
or
the
delegate
selection
process
in
the
party
leaders,
i
can't
conceive
of
how
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
if
the
parties
wanted
to
select
the
delegates
or
select
the
candidates
to
be
their
standard
bearers,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
within
the
right
of
an
association
to
do;
and
would
be
perfectly
appropriate,
provided
that
there
was
an
access
for
independents
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
but
i
think
those
hypothetical
questions
are
could
the
state
vest
that
authority.
finally
i
think
it's
important
to
say...
oh,
one
more
preliminary
point.
it
is
competitive
in
new
york.
it
may
not
be
perfectly
competitive,
as
is
the
case
of
90
percent
of
the
congressional
districts
in
this
country,
which
are
said
not
to
be
competitive.
but
in
new
york,
six
sitting
judges
testified
in...
in...
in
the
lower
court
that
they
successfully
lobbied
delegates
to,
you
know,
to
be
candidates.
so
that
happens.
between
1900
and
2002,
this
is
appendix
130,
nearly
one
fourth
of
the
general
elections
in
new
york
were
competitive.
lopez
torres,
the
respondent,
received
25
votes
at
the
2002
judicial
selection
convention,
and
many
of
the
districts
in
new
york
are
not
dominated
by
a
single
party.
so
the
final
point
is
it
is
important
to
emphasize
this
is
a...
a
challenge
on
its
face
to
the
statute
that
simply
creates
a
delegate
election
and
it
then
creates
a
convention.
neither
of
those
provisions
can
possibly
be
constitutional,
and
so
what
the
respondents
are
complaining
about
is
what
party
bosses
do.
but
on
page
38
of
their
brief,
they
state
categorically
that
the
constitutional
offense
is
not
the
fact
that
party
leaders
act
as
one
would
expect
in
choosing
nominees.
in
other
words,
they
act...
party
leaders
act
like
party
leaders
and
exercise
their
influence.
they're
not
saying
that
that's
unconstitutional.
what
they're
saying
is
that
a
statute
that
allows
party
leaders
to
be
party
leaders,
to
be
constitutional,
to
act
in
ways
which
are
not
only
permissible
under
the
constitution
as
they
knowledge,
but
constitutionally
protected,
is
somehow
constitutional.
that
simply
is
not
consistent
with
any
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
which
says
that
political
parties
must
have
the
maximum
opportunity
to
select
their
leadership.
thank
you.
