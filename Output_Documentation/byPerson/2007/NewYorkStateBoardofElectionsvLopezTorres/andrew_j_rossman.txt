mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
justice
kennedy's
question
regarding
the
election
of
delegates
and
fairness
for
voters.
there
are
two
responses:
in
this
case
that
i
have...
this
case,
there
was
conceded
below
that
the
requirement
for
delegates
of
getting
only
500
signatures
was
no
barrier
at
all.
and
secondly,
i
would
say
that
in
considering
that
question,
justice
kennedy,
the
important
thing
is
to
consider
what
is
the
intended
role
that
the
state
gives
to
the
participants
in
this
process?
and
what
the
role
here
is
that
individual
voters
have
the
opportunity
to
vote
for
local
delegates
who
are
to
represent
their
interests
at
the
convention.
as
cousins
instructs,
once
they
have
the
opportunity
to
pull
a
lever
for
the
delegate
that
shares
their
values
and
their
preferences,
their
right
of
suffrage
is
satisfied.
what
they
do
not
have,
what
respondents
and
what
the
lower
courts
would
like
to
have
exist
but
doesn't
exist
and
isn't
required
under
the
constitution,
is
the
opportunity
for
rank-and-file
voters
to
vote
directly
for
the
candidates
at
the
nomination
stage,
and
that's
the
difference
between
a
delegate-based
convention
and
a
primary.
if
we
agree,
and
i
think
the
court
would
agree,
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
primary...
that's
something,
in
fact,
that's
conceded
in
this
case;
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
a
primary...
then
there
is
no
state
requirement
that
there
be
a
direct
opportunity
for
association
between
voter
and
candidate
at
the
nomination
phase;
that
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
and
constitutional
for
that
association
to
be
between
voter
and
delegate,
and
the
voters
then
rely
on
their
locally...
elected
delegates
to
advance
their
interest
in
the
convention
process.
that's
the
difference
between
a
convention
and
a
primary.
we
think
it's
a
critical
one
here.
so
the
cases--
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
--in
new
york
city,
the
evidence
below
was
that
approximately
12
to
13
percent
of
delegate
slates
are
contested.
what
we
suggest
is
that
the
availability
of
a
contest
is
the
key.
it's
not
the
frequency
of
the
contest,
because
there's
also
evidence
in
the
record
that
for
open
primaries
for
civil
court,
which
is
the
closest
parallel,
that
those
are
only
contested
28
percent
of
the
time.
so
the
fact
that
an
election
is
not
contested,
that
there
may
be
voter
apathy
out
there,
that
there
may
be
party
unity
that
causes
people
to
rally
behind
the
parties
and
their
leadership,
is
not
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
well,
that
is
not
the
general
case
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
but
even
if
it
is,
the
important
thing
is
not
that
individual
candidates
appear
to
politic
before
the
delegates,
it's
that
delegates
have
the
freedom
under
the
statute
to
vote
for
whatever
candidate
they
like.
there's
evidence
that
there's
legislative
intent
that,
in
fact,
candidates
not
appear
at
the
convention
because
it
would
be
unseemly
for
them
to
do
so.
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
let
me
respond
to
the
most
difficult
part
of
your
question
first,
which
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
party
leader
selecting
a
candidate
we
think
is
not
troublesome
at
all.
in
fact,
there
are
many
instances
in
new
york
and
in
other
states
where
the
political
leaders,
through
their
structure,
do
pick
the
candidates,
for
example
in
the
case
of
vacancy
election,
which
this
court
upheld
as
constitutional
in
the
rodriquez
case.
but
the
question
that
i
think
that
you're
asking
is,
is
there
some
denial
of
voter
or
delegate
education,
and
does
that
pose
a
constitutional
problem?
we
have
here
a
bare
statutory
framework
and
the
statutory
framework
does
not
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
preclude
the
ability
of
delegates
to
become
educated
about
the
candidates.
within
that
bare
statutory
framework.
the
parties
themselves,
through
what
we
contend
is
core
associational
activity
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
participate
in
their
own
way
of
choosing
in
educating
delegates
and
in
putting
forth
the
candidacies
of
judicial...
potential
judicial
nominees.
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
in
fact,
we
think
that
is
the
very
judgment
that
the
state
has
made
here.
and
when,
as
mr.
olson
said,
when
it
went
from
a
primary
to
a
convention
process,
the
idea
behind
it
in
part
was
that
the
delegates
could
be
more
educated,
would
be
expected
to
be
more
educated
than
rank-and-file
voters
would
be
about
judges.
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
that
rank-and-file
voters
are
not
educated
hardly
at
all
about
the
judge
candidates
that
they
select.
so
we
think
this
is
clearly
a
legislative
sensible
policy
choice
to
put
the
selection
process
in
the
hands
of
those
who
have
the
motivation
and
the
opportunity
to
become
more
educated
about
those
that
they're
selecting.
now,
one
thing
that
needs
to
be
recalled
in
this
process
is,
of
course,
it
is
not
merely
a
state-run
election.
as...
as
the
court
observed
in
jones,
it
is
a
party
affair,
too.
so
there
are
core
first
amendment
rights
of
the
parties
themselves
that
attach.
and
the
question...
i
think
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
whether
there's
confusion
between
the
party
leaders
and
the
parties,
it
is
our
reading
of
the
eu,
tashjian
and
jones
cases
that
the
court
has
recognized
that
parties
have
a
structure
and
have
the
core
constitutional
right
to
create
their
own
structure,
and
their
leadership
can
make
choices
for
the
parties.
so
they
can
choose
to
endorse
candidates,
for
example.
they
can
choose
to
associate
or
not
associate
with
particular
individuals.
and
that's
a
choice
that's
made
here
by
duly
elected
leaders
of
the
parties.
and
if
there's
a
problem
with
that,
the
remedy
for
that
problem
is
in
the
political
arena.
the
remedy
is
for
the
rank-and-file
voters
to
vote
their
party
leaders
out
when
they
come
up
for
election
if
they
adopt
a
process
that
they
don't
like
or
they
think
squelches
the
input
of
the
rank-and-file
members.
so
the
reason
that...
the
reason
why
that's
not
happening
here,
we
believe,
could
be
attributable
to
one
of
two
things.
it
could
be
attributable
to
apathy,
which
the
constitution
does
not
have
a
prerogative
to
stamp
out,
or
it
could
be
attributable
to
party
unity
and
the
fact
that
leaders
are
sensitive
to
who
will
be
best
to
advance
the
interests
of
their
rank-and-file
members.
but
we
don't
think
there's
a
constitutional
problem
with
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
well,
the
only
system
that
new
york
is
forcing
is
a
bare
framework
for
representative
democracy.
it's
a
convention.
it's
no
different
than--
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
--absolutely
not.
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
we
absolutely
agree.
the
parties
intervened
from
the
outset
of
this
case,
both
major
parties,
because
they
share
the
view
that
the
system
is
better
than
a
primary
would
be,
and
they
believe
that
their
right--
mr.
andrew
j.
rossman
--well,
however
the
legislative
process
has
unfolded,
in
1921,
multiple
times
since,
and
to
the
present
when
the
legislature
filed
an
amicus
brief
with
the
second
circuit,
the
legislature
has
clearly
been
in
support
of
this.
and
we
think
it's
within...
it's
a
core
state
power,
it's
a
sensible
legislative
choice
that
they
have
made.
it'
ss
within
the
contours
of
american
party
of
texas
v.
white,
which
recognized,
as
justice
scalia
observed
moments
ago,
that
the
state
can
choose
to
have
primaries
or
conventions.
where
the
state
has
chosen
to
have
conventions,
party
rights
attach
to
that.
and
the
one
thing
that
the
lower
court
did
that
we
urge
the
court
to
consider
to
be
quite
inappropriate
was
to
apply
strict
scrutiny
to
what
is
routine
core
party
associational
activity.
leaders
developing
candidacies,
recommending
candidates,
endorsing
candidates,
and
fielding
delegates
who
they
think
are
loyal
to
the
interests
of
the
party,
that
doesn't
deserve
strict
scrutiny.
at
worst,
we
think
there's
no
burden
here
to
the
rank-and-file
voters
to
force
them
to
participate
in
the
party's
own
convention.
but
even
if
there
were
some
burden,
at
worst,
we
think
that
there
are
countervailing
rights
here.
and
where
there
are
countervailing
rights
the
court
should
prefer
to
the
legislative
expertise
here,
and
the
expertise...
thank
you,
your
honor.
