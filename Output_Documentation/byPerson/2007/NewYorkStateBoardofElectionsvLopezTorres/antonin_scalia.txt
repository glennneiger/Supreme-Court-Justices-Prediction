the
state
has
not
allowed
it.
the
state
has
required
it,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
although
if
we...
if
we
hold
it
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
require
it,
i
suppose
it
would
also
be
unconstitutional
for
the
state
merely
to
allow
it,
wouldn't
it?
so
that
this
manner
of
selecting
judges
in
any
other
state,
if
it
has
been
voluntarily
adopted
by
the
party,
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if...
what
if
it
were
the
parties
that
objected
to
this
and
not
some
individual
who
said,
i'm
not
being
given
enough
voice
in
the
party?
what
if
the
parties
said,
we
don't
want
to
select
our
candidates
this
way?
is
it
clear
that
the
state
could
impose
it
upon
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
state
can
restrict
that
right
if
it
wants
to.
the
state
can
require
the
party
to
select
its
candidates
by...
by
primary.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
by
convention.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
state
wants
to
do
it
by
smoke...
if
the
party
wants
to
do
it
by
smoke-filled
room,
the
state
can
say,
if
it
wishes
to
say,
you
can't
do
it
by
smoke-filled
room.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that...
but
that's
not
the
issue
here.
the
state
and
the
party
are
in
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
is
not
trying
to
coerce
the
party
into
doing
something
that
it
doesn't
want
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we...
have
we
imposed
any
such
restrictions
on
our
own,
as
opposed
to
merely
upholding
restrictions
that
were
imposed
by
the
state?
that
is
to
say,
have
we
held
that
the
constitution
itself
imposes
certain
restrictions?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
want
a
case
where
the
state
did
not
impose
the
restriction
and
it
was
up
to
us
to
decide
whether
the
state
could
do
that
or
not,
but
rather
the
state
said
the
party
can
do
whatever
it
wants,
and
we
have
disallowed
what
the
party
itself
chose
under
no
compulsion
from
the
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
basis
of
some
constitutional
principle
apart
from
the
equal
protection
clause--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
the
thirteenth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
parties
are
not
protesting
in
this
case,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
and
when
that
situation
arises,
i
suppose
we
can...
we
can
decide
it.
but
it's
not
here.
the
parties
are
totally
happy
with
this
and
would
do
it
on
their
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
it
is
probably
likely
the
parties
got
this
system
adopted
by
the
new
york
legislature.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
general
election
case,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schwarz...
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
person
wouldn't
be
opposed
if
he
approached
the
boss
and
the
boss
said:
yeah.
boy,
i
really
like
you.
that
person
would
automatically
not
be
a
rebel.
he'd
be
part
of
the
establishment.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not.
you're
really
arguing
against
the
whole
purpose
this
scheme,
which
is
not
to
have
judges
popularly
elected.
and
you're
saying
no,
we
want
them
popularly
elected.
the
purpose
of
the
scheme
is
to...
is
to
have
the
people
elect
delegates
and
have
delegates
use
their
good
judgments
as
to
who...
as
to
who
the
best
judge
would
be.
but
you
say,
no,
we
want
the
people
to
have
an
input.
i
mean,
it's
contrary
to
the
whole
purpose
of
the
scheme.
of
course
it
works
the
way
you
say
it
does.
it
is
designed
to
work
that
way.
it's
a
basic
judgment
not
to
have
judges
popularly
elected,
and
your
objection
amounts
to
saying
no,
judges
ought
to
be
popularly
elected.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying
the
state
could
compel
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
state
could
permit
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
the
new
york
states
manner
of
selecting
its
supreme
court
justices.
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
state
is
not
the
state's
highest
court,
but
rather
its
trial
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
there
are
a
total
of
328
supreme
court
justices
who
are
elected
to
14-year
terms
in
each
of
the
state's
12
judicial
districts.
since
1921,
the
state
has
required
political
parties
to
nominate
their
candidates
for
the
supreme
court
by
a
convention
composed
of
delegates
elected
by
party
members
in
a
delegate
primary,
held
in
september.
the
primary
is
held
in
each
of
the
state's
150
assembly
districts
to
select
delegates
to
the
convention
for
the
judicial
district
in
which
the
assembly
district
is
located.
anyone
can
run
for
delegate
by
submitting
to
the
board
of
elections
a
designating
petition
signed
by
500
enrolled
party
members
who
reside
in
the
relevant
assembly
district.
the
nominating
conventions
take
place
in
each
judicial
district
one
to
two
weeks
after
the
delegate
primary.
the
persons,
a
convention
nominates,
appear
automatically
on
the
general
election
ballot
along
with
the
nominees
of
other
qualifying
parties
and
along
with
independent
candidates
who
collect
the
certain
number
of
signatures.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
candidates
who
failed
to
secure
the
nominations
of
their
parties,
voters
who
--
who
supported
those
candidates
and
a
public
interest
organization.
they
filed
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
contending
that
new
york's
convention
system
violates
the
first
amendment
rights
of
challengers
running
against
candidates
favored
by
party
leaders.
they
sought
an
injunction
mandating
a
direct
primary
election
to
select
supreme
court
nominees.
the
district
court
gave
the
--
the
relief
requested
and
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
and
hold
that
new
york's
election
law
does
not
violate
respondents'
first
amend
of
rights.
respondents
first
invoked
the
first
amendment
rights
of
political
parties
to
associate
with
their
members,
to
limit
their
membership
and
to
select
their
candidates
in
a
manner
that
best
represents
their
political
platforms.
such
a
right,
we
have
held,
protects
a
party
from
excessive
state
interference
in
party
affairs.
in
the
present
case,
however,
the
party's
associational
rights
are
at
issue,
if
at
all,
only
as
a
shield
and
not
as
a
sword.
both
the
democratic
and
state
--
both
the
democratic
and
republican
state
parties
appeared
as
amici
to
defend
new
york's
election
law,
so
the
parties,
as
far
as
it
appears,
one
to
select
their
nominees
by
convention.
respondents
thus,
cannot
rely
on
the
right
that
the
first
amendment
confers
on
political
parties.
respondents
also
contend,
however,
that
new
york's
electoral
system
violates
their
own
first
amendment
rights
because
it
does
not
assure
them
a
fair
chance
of
prevailing
in
their
party's
candidate's
election
process.
that
asserted
right
finds
no
support
in
our
precedence.
even
if
we
acknowledged
that
an
individual
has
a
first
amendment
right
to
run
in
a
party
primary
without
undue
state
imposed
impediment,
new
york's
500
signature
requirement
for
delegate
candidates
is
entirely
reasonable.
a
state
may
demand
a
minimum
degree
of
support
before
giving
someone
access
to
a
ballot.
respondents'
real
complaint
is
that
they
have
no
realistic
chance
of
prevailing
at
the
convention
because
the
party
leadership's
preferred
delegates
are
always
elected
to
the
convention
and
the
party
leadership's
proposed
nominees
always
win
in
the
convention.
but
if
this
true,
it
says
no
more
than
that
the
party
leadership
has
more
widespread
support
than
candidates
not
supported
by
the
party
leadership.
no
new
york
law
compels
election
of
the
leadership
slate
or
for
that
matter
compels
the
delegates
selected
on
the
leadership
slate
to
vote
the
way
the
leadership
desires.
and
no
state
law
prohibits
an
unsupported
candidate
from
attending
the
convention
and
seeking
to
persuade
the
delegates
to
vote
for
her.
our
cases
invalidating
ballot
access
requirements
have
focused
on
the
requirements
themselves.
for
example,
an
excessive
--
a
requirement
of
a
--
of
an
excessively
high
number
of
signatures
and
not
--
they
have
not
focused
on
the
manner
in
which
political
actors
function
under
those
state
requirements.
here,
respondents
complain
none
of
the
state
law
but
of
the
voter's
preference
and
their
elected
delegates'
preference
for
the
choices
of
the
party
leadership.
to
be
sure,
we
have
permitted
states
to
set
their
faces
against
party
bosses
by
requiring
party
candidate
selection
through
processes
more
favorable
to
insurgence
such
as
the
direct
primary
that
respondents
seek,
but
to
say
that
the
state
can
--
can
require
this
is
a
far
cry
from
saying
that
the
constitution
demands
it.
none
of
our
cases
establish
a
candidate's
constitutional
right
to
have
a
fair
shot
at
winning
a
party's
nomination.
party
conventions
with
their
attended
smoke
filled
rooms
and
domination
by
party
leaders
have
long
been
an
accepted
manner
of
selecting
party
candidates.
if
they
have
their
disadvantages,
so
does
the
direct
primary
which
new
york
used
to
employ
for
the
nomination
of
supreme
court
justices,
but
abandoned
86
years
ago
because
it
left
judicial
selection
to
voters
entirely
uninformed
about
judicial
qualifications
and
placed
a
high
premium
on
the
ability
to
raise
a
lot
of
money.
finally,
we
give
no
weight
to
respondent's
assertion
that
a
first
amendment
right
exists
in
the
present
case
because
of
the
special
factor
that
party
loyalty
in
new
york
state
renders
the
general
election
ballot
in
each
district
uncompetitive.
candidates
who
fail
to
obtain
their
party's
nomination
can
still
get
on
that
general
election
ballot
by
submitting
enough
signatures.
this
ensures
that
respondents
have
an
opportunity
to
appear
on
the
general
election
ballot
which
is
all
that
the
protection
of
their
asserted
interest
requires.
respondents'
demand
that
we
counteract
this
special
factor
of
the
voter's
party
loyalty,
their
demand
that
we
counteract
this,
turns
the
first
amendment
on
its
head.
the
first
amendment
creates
an
open
marketplace
where
ideas
may
compete
without
government
interference.
it
does
not
call
on
the
federal
courts
to
manage
the
market
by
preventing
too
many
buyers
from
settling
upon
a
single
product.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
eight
justices
join
the
opinion
of
the
court.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined
in
part.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
