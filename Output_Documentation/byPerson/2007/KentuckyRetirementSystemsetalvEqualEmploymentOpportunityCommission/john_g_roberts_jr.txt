we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-1037,
kentucky
retirement
systems
v.
eeoc.
mr.
klausner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
always
based
on
age
plus
service.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
is
there
any
reason...
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
we
should
view
this
as
a
retirement
plan
and
there
are
a
number
of
ways
you
can
be
eligible
for
retirement:
age
plus
years
of
service,
but
another
way
you
can
be
eligible
is
disability.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
effect
of
this
litigation
is
that
policemen
or
firefighters
who
are
injured
and
become
disabled
now
get
lower
benefits
for
disability?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
fine
for
them
to
use
that,
but
you're
saying
it's
not
fine
for
them
to
use
any
element
of
age
in
making
that
computation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though,
under
the
federal
law,
they
can
use
age
as
the
exclusive
requirement
in
determining
retirement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
prevent
the
state
from
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
younger
disabled
workers
have
not
had
the
same
opportunity
that
older
disabled
workers
have.
and
it
results...
if
we
adopt
your
system
where
you
can
look
only
at
years
of
service,
what
it,
in
effect,
is
going
to
do
is
to
prevent
kentucky
from
giving
disability
benefits
to
older
workers
who
become
disabled.
for
example,
if
you
have
two
workers,
one
who
starts
work
at
18
and
acquires
years
of
service,
say,
12
years
of
service
and
becomes
disabled,
you
would
say,
well,
you
can
take
those
years
of
service
into
account.
the
older
worker
who
begins
at
age
30
and
is
disabled
in
his
first
year
on
the
job,
you
say,
well,
you
can
only
look
at
years
of
service.
you
can't
impute
to
both
of
them
retirement
age.
so
the
30-year-old
who
becomes
disabled
has
to
get
less,
fewer
benefits
than
the
18-year-old
who
becomes
disabled.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
now,
mr.
klausner,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
klausner.
the
case
is
submitted.
