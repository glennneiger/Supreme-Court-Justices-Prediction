mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
calculating
the
retirement
benefits
owed
to
disabled
workers,
kentucky
uses
age
as
an
explicit
decisionmaking
factor
in
a
way
that
disadvantages
older
employees.
although
kentucky
may
be
able
to
establish
on--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
does
in
the
sense
that,
with
respect
to
disabled
employees,
two
employees
who
have
the
same
total
years
of
actual
service
but
who
are
of
different
ages
may
receive
dramatically
different
benefits.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's...
let
me
direct
your
attention
to
the
relevant
provision
of
the
kentucky
statute,
and
it's
at
page
7a
and
8a
of
the
blue
brief.
this
is
with
respect
to...
it's
true
that,
for
a
normal
retirement,
an
individual
either
has
to
be
age
55
with
5
years
of
service
or
have
20
years
of
service
at
whatever
age.
but
if
you
look
at
the
requirements
for
disability
retirement
in
particular,
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
it
says:
"any
person
may
qualify
to
retire
on
disability
subject
to
the
following.
"
"the
person
shall
have
60
months
of
service,
12
of
which
shall
be
current
service
credited
under
provisions
of
kentucky
law.
"
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
they...
they
are
different
in
the
sense
that
they
are
calculated
differently.
that
is,
if
all
kentucky
had
done
was
say--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
program--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
incorrect.
there
are
two
distinct
functions
of...
there
are
two
distinct
differences
between
disability
retirement
and
normal
retirement:
the
first
is
that
the
eligibility
criteria
are
different.
in
order
to
qualify
for
normal
retirement,
you
have
to
be
either
55
years
old
with
5
years
of
service
or
have
20
years
of
service.
for
disability
retirement,
you
become
eligible
if
you
are
of
any
age
and
are
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability
and
have
at
least
five
years
of
service.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
you
can't.
the
first
thing
i
would
say
about
that
exception
is
it
refers
specifically
to
a
minimum
age,
and
what
that
was
intended
to
make
clear
was
that
to
the
extent
that
kentucky
allows
55-year-olds
to
retire
with
only
5
years
of
service,
but
requires
a
45-year-old
to
have
20
years
of
service,
that
minimum
age
would
not
violate
the
statute.
now,
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
cline,
that
provision
in
a
sense
is
superfluous
because
the
younger
worker
wouldn't
have
an
adea
claim
anyway.
but
the
reference
to
a
minimum
age
is
intended
to
address
that
situation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
is
certainly
not
illegitimate
for
kentucky
to
say:
we
want
to
be
more
generous
to
people
who
are
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability
than
to
people
who
choose
to
retire
voluntarily
when
they
are
physically
capable
of
continuing
to
work.
and
so
if
kentucky
wants
to
say,
in
the
case
of
an
individual
who
is
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability,
we
will
add
additional
years
in
computing
benefits
to
estimate
the
number
of
years
this
person
would
have
worked
had
he
or
she
not
become
disabled,
that's
fine
as
well.
what
they
can't
do,
at
least
what
they
can't
do
without
establishing
one
of
the
affirmative
defenses,
is
use
age
as
a
proxy,
as
the
basis
for
deciding
how
many
years
would
this
person
have
worked
if
he
or
she
had
not
become
disabled
because--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
they
are
going
to
give
the
45-year-old
with
10
years
of
service
10
years
of
credit,
they
have
to
give
the
55-year-old
10
years
of
service...
with
10
years
of
service
10
years
of
credit,
again,
unless
they
can
establish
the
cost-justification
defense.
and
part
of
the
argument
they
are
making
is
it
would
be
unduly
expensive
to
guarantee
the
55-year-old
an
additional
10
years
of
service,
because
it's
much
more
likely
that
the
55-year-old
will
become
disabled
than
it
is
with
the
45-year-old.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
to
go
back
to
the
question
you
were
asking
mr.
klausner,
i
think
if
we
were
looking
at
the
class
of
voluntary
retirees,
it
would
be
an
accurate
generalization
to
say
that
those
above
55
were
likely
to
have
fewer
years
of
service
than
the
younger
people.
because
the
only
way
that
a
younger
person
could
qualify
for
normal
retirement
would
be
to
amass
20
years
of
service;
whereas,
the
older
person
could
do
it
with
fewer
years.
but
if
you
are
looking
at
people
who
want
to
continue
working
but
who
are
prevented
from
doing
so
by
reason
of
disability,
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
older
people
are
going
to
have
spent
less
time
in
the
line
of
fire
than
the
younger
people.
and,
in
any
event,
the
comparison
that
we
are
making--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
we're
looking
at
the
class
of
people
who...
including
over
55-year-old
and
under
55-year-old...
who
want
to
continue
working
but
who
have
been
prevented
from
doing
so
by
reason
of
disability,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
older
people
within
that
class,
as
a
group,
will
have
fewer
years
in
the
line
of
fire
than
the
younger
people.
and,
in
any
event--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
no.
under
their
belt.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
not
just
happenstance,
because
if
you're
guessing
the
likely
tenure
of
service
of
people
who
take
voluntary
normal
retirement
before
age
55,
in
a
sense
you
are
skewing
the
class,
because
the
only
people
who
can
do
that
under
kentucky
law
are
people
with
at
least
20
years
of
service.
so
the
voluntary
retirees,
the
younger
people,
as
a
group,
are
likely
to
be...
have
longer
tenure.
but
that
generalization
doesn't
hold
true
with
respect
to
people
who
are
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
our
point
is
that
they
should
use
the
same
computation
methodology
for
both
categories
of
employees.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
incorrect,
and
that
was
really
the
point
i
was
making
by
quoting
from
the
kentucky
law
on
page
7a
and
8a.
the
kentucky
provision
that
i
quoted
was
the
provision
that
establishes
eligibility
for
disability
retirement.
and
it
says,
as
the
criterion
for
eligibility,
beyond,
of
course,
the
fact
of
disability,
the
person
shall
have
60
months
of
service.
so
an
individual
under
kentucky
law
who
is
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability
and
has
at
least
five
years
of
service
is
eligible
for
disability
retirement.
the
imputation
of
additional
years
of
service
is
not
necessary--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--exactly.
well,
the
purpose
of
defining
the
category
of
eligible
persons
is
to
make
sure
that
they
do
get
a
retirement
benefit
even
though
they
wouldn't
satisfy
the
normal
age
and
service
requirements
for
ordinary
retirement.
and
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
kentucky
can
say
we
want
to
define
a
separate
category
of
individuals
who
don't
satisfy
normal
age
and
service
rules
but
who
should,
nevertheless,
be
given
a
retirement
benefit
because
they
have
been
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability.
that's
fine.
and
if
they
use
the
same
computation
methodology,
namely,
some
factor
of
actual
years
of
service
times
final
compensation
times
a
multiplier,
as
they
do
for
normal
retirement,
that
would
be
fine.
our--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
again,
there
is
a
an
explicit
exemption
in
the
adea
for
a
minimum
retirement
age.
and
so
it
wouldn't
have
violated...
even
apart
from
this
court's
decision
in
cline,
it
wouldn't
have
violated
the
adea
to
say
an
individual
who
is
55
with
five
years
of
service
can
get
retirement,
even
though
a
younger--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
again,
i
think
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
are
a
couple
of
things
i'd
say.
the
first
is
that
the
act
is
quite
specific
in
saying
that
a
state
may
establish
a
minimum...
may
establish
a
retirement
age
with
respect
to
its
state
police
and
firefighters,
but
it
doesn't
say
the
adea
is
inapplicable
to
police
and
firefighters
who
are
over
age
55.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
are
several
different
answers
i
would
give.
the
first
is
if
the
greater
included
the
lesser,
it
would
be
permissible
for
kentucky
to
say:
we
will
keep
the
over
55-year-old
people
on
the
work
force,
but
we'll
pay
them
less
because
of
their
age.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
incorrect,
that
is,
the
two
justifications
that
have
been
given
for
the
disparate
treatment
of
older
workers
are,
first,
younger
workers
as
a
group
are
likely
to
need
more
of
a
boost;
and,
second,
the
younger
disabled
person
probably
would
have
worked
longer
if
he
had
not
become
disabled.
and
so
this
replicates
the
situation
that
would
have
prevailed.
i
think,
whether
or
not
you
want
to
think
of
those
as
stigmatizing
stereotypes,
it's
quite
clear
that
neither
of
those
generalizations
could
typically
be
used
as
a
basis
for
age-based
disparities.
for
instance,
nobody
would
claim
that
an
employer
could
pay
the
older
workers
less
because
they
are
likely
to
be
less
in
need
of
financial
assistance.
and
with
respect
to
the
initial--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
on
the
whole,
the
benefit
bears
a
close...
the
retirement
benefit
bears
a
close
relationship
to
what
you
have
done.
that
is,
the
benefit
is
calculated
on
the
basis
of
actual
years
of
service,
and
the
purpose
clearly
is,
in
part,
to
reward
the
employee
for
service
to
the
employer.
but
with
respect
to...
and
that's
the
way
it's
done
with
respect
to
the
older
disabled
worker.
his
benefits
are
computed
based
on
what
years
of
service
he
has
actually
contributed
to
the
employer.
with
respect
to
the
younger
people,
it's
not
based
on
that
alone.
rather,
the
state
imputes
additional
years--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
there
could
be
a
range
of
alternatives.
one
alternative,
for
instance,
would
be
for
every
disabled
worker
of
whatever
age
impute
an
additional
five
years
of
service
as
something
of
a
rough
estimate
of
the
number
that
person
might
have
worked
if
he
or
she
had
not
become
disabled.
another
possibility
would
be
to
impute
years
of
service
up
to
10
or
20.
again,
there
would
be
probably
an
infinite
number
of
ways
it
could
be
done
as
long
as
age
were
not
used
as,
as
the
basis.
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
say
about--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
other
thing
i
would
say
about
that
justification,
which
rests
on
i
think
the
valid
statistical
correlation
between
how
old
you
are
at
the
time
that
you're
disabled
and
how
much
longer
you
would
have
worked.
again,
whether
or
not...
i
think
you
wouldn't
think
of
that
as
an
invidious
stereotype.
but
again,
it's
not
a
generalization
that
could
typically
be
used
as
a
basis
for
age-specific
decisions.
for
example,
the
wirtz
report
makes
clear
that
the
paradigmatic
pre-ada
practice
that
congress
wanted
to
get
rid
of
was
a
limit
of
age
50
or
age
45
and
an
employer
saying:
we're
not
going
to
hire
anybody
who
is
over
that
age.
and
certainly
the
employer
could
say
justifiably
as
a
group
people
above
that
age
are
likely
to
have
fewer
work
years
ahead
of
them
than
people
below
that
age.
and
if
that
generalization
could
provide
a
basis
for
an
explicit
age-based
distinction,
the
act
would
really
be
eviscerated.
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
respond
to
is
the
suggestion
that,
while
we
might
be
able
to
tease
this
out
of
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
this
is
certainly
an
unintended
consequence.
it
is
not
something
that
congress
would
have
wanted.
i
think,
to
the
contrary,
this
is
not
identical
but
very
similar
to
the
type
of
disparity
that
was
present
in
betts.
that
is,
in
betts
the
individual
was
over
the
age
of
normal
retirement
but
had
elected
to
keep
working.
she
became
disabled
and
was
prevented
from
continuing
to
work.
she
was
eligible
for
normal
retirement
benefits.
she
wanted
to
collect
disability
retirement
benefits,
because
again,
the
reason
for
her
retirement
was
disability.
she
was
told
that
she
couldn't
do
it.
and
the
state's
computation
methodology
for
calculating
disability
retirement
benefits
was
significantly
more
generous
than
the
one
that
it
offered
for--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think,
first,
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
way
that
the
word
vii.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
court
in
thurston
has
said
the
language
of
the
adea
should
be
construed
similarly
to
that
of
title
vii
because
the
basic
anti-discrimination
prohibition
was
drawn
in
haec
verba
from
title
vii
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
older
workers's
benefit
protection
act
when
congress
amended
the
statute
to
cover
fringe
benefits,
which
the
court
in
betts
had
held
were
not
covered.
congress
did
that
by
enacting
a
new
29
u.s.c.
630(l)
to
say
the
term...
that
the
phrase
"terms
and
conditions
of
employment"
includes
fringe
benefits.
and
the
legislative
history
explains
that
congress
could
have
achieved
the
same
result
by
adding
a
reference
to
fringe
benefits
in
the
basic
anti-discrimination
provision
contained
in
29
u.s.c.
623(a),
but
the
congress
chose
not
to
do
that
because
it
wanted
to
maintain
the
similarity
in
wording
between
the
adea's
anti-discrimination
provision
and
that
of
title
vii
in
order
to
reinforce
the
inference
that
the
two
were
to
be
construed
in
pari
materia.
the
other
thing
i
would
say
with
respect
to
your
reference
to
age
distinctions
that
are
not
based
on
stereotypes
is
again
to
return
to
what
i
was
discussing
earlier.
the
two
justifications
that
have
been
offered
are
first,
younger
people
are
likely
to
have
fewer
financial
resources,
so
they
need
more
of
a
boost;
the
second
is
the
younger
worker
probably
would
have
worked
longer
if
he
hadn't
become
disabled
and
therefore
this
is
replicating
the
situation
that
would
have
prevailed
absent
the
disability.
and
again,
my
point
is,
whether
or
not
you
think
of
those
as
invidious
stereotypes,
they
are
plainly
not
generalizations
that
could
typically
be
used
to
justify--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
discrimination
is
if
you
imagine--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it
depends
on
other
variables.
for
instance,
if
you
have
a--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--as
to
the
person
who
is
five
years
away
from
qualifying
by
reason
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--years
of
service,
if
that
person
is
younger
than
50,
then
they'll
be
treated
the
same,
because
each
of
them
will
have--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
it
is
a
discrimination
on
the
basis--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it
wouldn't...
there
wouldn't
be
any
claim
of
disparate
treatment
with
respect
to
those
two
individuals.
but
if
you
have
an
individual
who
is
55
years
old
with
15
years
of
service
and
50
years
old
with
15
years
of
service,
they
are
both
equally
close
to
the
20-year
threshold
for
qualifying
for
normal
retirement
on
the
basis
of
years
of
service.
yet
the
50-year-old
gets
5
imputed
years
added
and
gets
a
significantly
larger
benefit
than
the
55-year-old.
their
justification
is,
well,
the
55-year-old
is
already
eligible
for
normal
retirement
and
therefore,
it's
fair
to
treat
him
differently.
and
the
point
i
was
making
with
reference
to
the
kentucky
code
is
the
50-year-old
who
is
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability
is
also
eligible
for
retirement.
it's
called
disability
retirement.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
if
all
the
state
did
was
to
say
disability
retirement
benefits
will
be
available
to
people
who
have
at
least
five
years
of
service
and
are
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability
and
we
are
excluding
people
who
are
above
55,
in
and
of
itself
that's
fine.
if
the
only
purpose
of
excluding
the
older
workers
is
to
make
clear
that
they
can't
get
both
benefits
simultaneously,
there
is
no
problem
with
that.
our
problem
is
that,
having
defined
the
class
of
persons
eligible
for
disability
benefits
to
include
only
those
who
are
under
55--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--they
did
use
a
more
generous
computation
methodology.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
only
one
benefit.
and
really,
that's
part
of
our
point.
it's
only
one
benefit,
so
why
would
they
say
that
people
who
are
older
will
have
their
benefits
computed
using
a
different
formula
than
people
who
are
younger?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
first,
we
are
not
preventing
kentucky
from
imputing
additional
years.
we
are
simply
saying
the
method
of
determining
how
many
years
will
be
imputed,
absent
an
affirmative
defense,
can't
be
dependent
on
the
employee's
age.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
quite
sure
if
i
understand
the
question,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
there
would
be
anything
wrong
with
kentucky
saying
we
are
going...
in
fact,
this
is
what
we
are
asking
for.
if
kentucky
wants
to
say
a
younger
person
who
is
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability
will
be
treated
as
though
he
were
55
years
old,
that's
fine.
if
they
give
him
disability
benefits
and
they
calculate
the
benefits
using
actual
years
of
service
as
they
do
for
the
other...
for
the
older
employees,
that
there
is
no
adea
problem
with
that.
our
problem
is
that
they
say
we
are
treating
him
as
though
he
had
worked
additional
years
until
he
was
55
when
he
hasn't,
and
when
the
older
employee
isn't
given
that
same
opportunity.
and,
again,
it
is
true
that
kentucky's
system
is
particularly
generous
to
older
employees
who
want
to
retire
voluntarily.
they
can
retire
with
as
little
as
five
years
of
service,
even
though
the
younger
worker
would
have
to
have
more.
but
the
people
on
whose
behalf
the
eeoc
is
suing
have
not
derived
any
of
that
benefit.
these
were
people
who
did
not
retire
voluntarily.
they
were
people
who
were
eligible
for
retirement
benefits,
but
chose
to
remain
in
the
work
force.
and,
essentially,
they
are
being
told,
in
estimating
how
many
more
years
you
would
have
worked,
we
are
going
to
have
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
the
answer
is
zero,
even
though
their
very
circumstances,
the
fact
that
they
continued
to
work
after
they
could
have
retired,
belie
that
assumption.
and
just
a
final
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
betts,
is
that
the
system
here
is
not
identical,
but
very
similar
to
the
system
that
was
at
issue
there,
in
the
sense
that
an
older
worker
who
was
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability
got
a
lower
benefit
than
she
would
have
received
if
she
had
been
younger
with
the
same
years
of
service
and
the
same
disability.
it
couldn't
be
clearer
that
congress
wanted
to
overturn
that
decision.
that
was
the
impetus
for
the
enactment
of
the
owbpa.
so
i
think
there
is
really...
it's
not
correct
to
suggest
that,
even
if
we
win,
this
is
somehow
an
unintended
consequence
of
what
congress
did.
this
is
the
very
situation
that
congress
wanted
to
cover
while
providing
an
affirmative
defense
to
employers
who
can
satisfy
it.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
not
available
for
a
regular
retiree,
and
it's
not
available
for
a
person
who
is
eligible
for
normal
retirement
but
becomes
disabled
and
is
forced
to
retire
for
that
reason.
if
the
only
problem
were
that
kentucky
made
those
benefits
available
to
people
who
were
forced
to
retire
due
to
disability,
that
wouldn't
be
an
adea
violation,
so
long
as
they
made
those
benefits
available
to
the
older
worker
who
was
also
forced
to
retire.
but
i
take
your
point
that
those
aspects
of
the
statute
introduce
a
further
element
of
age
discrimination
without
even
the
justification
that
kentucky
has
proffered
for
the
imputed
years.
with
respect
to
the
children,
in
particular,
that
seems
to
be
the
only
other
area
in
the
plan
in
which
kentucky
is
directly
targeting
the
people
who
are
in
greatest
financial
need,
at
least
by
one
measure
having
dependent
children,
and
yet
the
older
workers
are
left
out
of
that
entirely.
