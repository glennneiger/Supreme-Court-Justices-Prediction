you're
saying
you're
one
step
removed.
you're
making
your
determination
on
the
basis
of
eligibility
for
retirement,
which
in
turn
is
based
on
age.
and
you're
saying
that
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
be
in
better
shape
if
it
was
in
legislative
history
and
not
in
the
preamble.
we
probably
would
take
it
into
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
does
that
matter?
i
mean,
the
exception
in
the
statute
is
for...
for
retirement,
taking
age
into
account
for
retirement,
is
narrowly
crafted.
it
says
that
they
can
make
any
decision
about...
they
can
require
the
attainment
of
a
minimum
age
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
normal
or
early
retirement.
now,
we
have
not
read
that
to
exclude
adding
an
additional
element
to
age,
namely
age
plus
years
of
service.
we
don't
say
that
that
disables
you
from
the...
from
that
exemption.
why
can't
you
add
a
third
factor?
age,
years
of
service,
and
disability.
justice
antonin
scalia
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
say
that
again.
just
say
the
last
thing
again.
i
didn't
follow
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i...
i
think...
you
mean
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
under
their
belt.
i
see.
