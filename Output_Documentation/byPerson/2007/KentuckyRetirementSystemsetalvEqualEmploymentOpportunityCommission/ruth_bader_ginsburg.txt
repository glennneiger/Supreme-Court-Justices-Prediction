i
think
the
congress
recognized
that
what
they
were
protecting
was
not
age
as
such,
but
old
age,
where
in
the
other
case
they
say
it's
the
racial
criterion
and
whether
it's...
or
the
sex
criterion,
whether
it's
a
man
that's
adversely
affected
or
a
woman
it
doesn't
make
any
difference;
title
vii
applies
to
them
both.
but
the
age
discrimination
act
doesn't
apply
to
younger
workers.
it
doesn't
say
that
you
can't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age,
so
you
can't
prefer
the
older
person
over
the
younger
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
one
little
piece
of
it
that
seems,
that
clearly
does
favor
the
younger
retiree.
and
that's
the...
what
is
it...
you're
guaranteed,
what
was
it,
at
least
25
percent
of
your
final
monthly
salary.
that's
not
under...
for
a
regular
retiree;
and
also
this
10
percent
that
you
get
added
on
for
each
child...
that's
not
part...
that's
somebody
who
is
disabled
gets
that,
but
not
somebody
who
is
already
a
retiree.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
that
answer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's
take
the
one
who
gets
over
the
five-year
initial
period.
the
disability
pay
when
you
no
longer
can
be
in
the
hazardous
occupation,
it
will
begin
immediately,
right?
you
don't
wait
until
you
get...
you're
55
to
get
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
with
respect
to
that,
mr.
stewart,
the
problem
that
justice
breyer
brought
up,
you...
if
you
would
look
to
your
brief,
page
30,
footnote
13,
the
question
is,
so
we
have
this...
if
we
take
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
how
can
we
deal
with
a
person
in
her
30s
who
becomes
disabled
when
she
is
making
a
low
salary
and
has
only,
say,
10
years
of
service?
she
is
going
to
get
a
very
low
disability.
and
you
say
that's
one
thing
that's
all
right.
on
a
prospective
basis,
what
could
kentucky
do?
one
is
give
the
younger
workers
only
their
actual
years
of
service,
which
mr.
klausner
said
is
what
is
happening,
and
therefore,
these
people
are
getting
a
lot
less
than
they
used
to
get.
and
then
you
say,
oh,
but
there's
another
way,
and
that
is
to
impute
additional
years
of
service
on
an
age-neutral
basis.
and
you're
not
specific
about
what
would
the
age-neutral
basis
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
before
you
finish,
that
little
piece
that
seems
to
be
favoring
the
younger
worker
that
you
guaranteed
at
least...
what
was
it,
25
percent
of
your
final
monthly
salary,
and
you
get
10
percent
for
each
child...
now
that
does
seem
to
be
something
that's...
that's
not
available
for
a
regular
retiree.
