justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
sometimes
based
on
age,
sometimes
years
of
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
your
plan
does
not
provide
a
disability
benefit
just
as
a
disability
benefit?
the
only
time
disability
is
relevant
is
when
it
determines
whether
or
not
a
person
will
become
eligible
for
the
regular
retirement
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
for
the
old
person
who
has
already
reached
retirement
age
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
get
a
disability
benefit
is
common
to
everybody
subject
to
the
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
because
of
the
period
necessary
to
qualify
for
retirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
you.
is
there...
is
it
your
position
there
is
a
disability
benefit
that
is
different
from
the
retirement
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
that
all
that
disability
did
was
determine...
help
get
a
man
who
is
disabled
eligible
for
the
retirement
benefit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
only
function
it
provides.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
boils
down
to
the
claim
that
people
who
have
already
reached...
become
eligible
for
retirement
by
either
age
or
period
of
service,
the
state
has
a
duty
to
give
them
a
chance
to
recover
a
disability
benefit
if
they
give
a
disability
benefit
to
younger
workers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
computation
is
for
a
different
purpose
in
that...
in...
for
the
younger
workers
the
purpose
is
to
make
them
eligible
for
retirement.
for
the
older
workers,
they
are
already
eligible
for
retirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
term
"eligibility
for
retirement",
as
used
in
that
part
of
the
statute,
is
referring
to
actually
the
same
thing
as
retirement
achieved
by
getting
their...
getting
credit
for
post-disability
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
right
on
that
point.
supposing
you
have
two
different
people
retire,
one...
that
become
disabled,
rather...
one
because
he's
five
years
short
of
the
age
eligibility
and
the
other
because
he's
five
years
short
of
years
of
service,
so
it
would
be
a
younger
person,
and
both
would
have
become
eligible
for
retirement
in
five
years
after
their
disability.
are
they
treated
the
same
way
under
the
plan?
and
if
they
are,
where
is
the
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
first
of
all,
tell
me
whether
they're
treated
the
same
way
under
the
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
other
variables?
justice
john
paul
stevens
years
of
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
hypothesis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
how
is
that
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
even
discrimination
as
far
as
i
see
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
your
claim
boils
down
to
an
argument
that
the
statute
requires
someone
who
is
already
qualified
for
retirement
to
get
a
disability
benefit
that
the
younger
person
would.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
basic
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
you
talking
about
two
benefits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
not
two
benefits.
it's
only
one.
