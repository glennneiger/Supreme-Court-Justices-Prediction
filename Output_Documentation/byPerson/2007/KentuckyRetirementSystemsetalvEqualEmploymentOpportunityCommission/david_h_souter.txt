justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
answer,
as
i
understand
it,
to
justice
breyer's
question
was,
could
be
boiled
down
to
this:
the
person
whose
disability
benefit
or
total
benefit
following
disability
is
calculated
on
the
basis
of
age
55,
is
less
likely
to
have
worked
or
is
likely
to
have
worked
less
long
than
the
person
whose
benefit
is
imputed
and
calculated
on
the
basis
of
20
years.
and
because
the
odds
are
that
we'll
say
the
person
in
the
55-year-old
category
has
worked
less
and
endured
less
risk,
it
is,
therefore,
fair
to
impute
less
time
on
average
to
such
a
person,
and
therefore,
give
a
lower
benefit.
you're
saying
there
is
a
tradeoff.
and
the
tradeoff
is
because
the
55-year-old
retiree
may
get
a
benefit
after
very
little
work
and
very
little
risk,
it
is
therefore
fair
and
not
a
discrimination
that
on
the
average
the
windfall
is
less
for
that
person
by
the
imputation
than
the
windfall
to
the
person
who
retires
on
the
basis
of
age
20.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
you're
sticking
in
a
word,
"arbitrary",
that
appears
nowhere
in
the
body
of
the
statute.
you
picked
it
up
from
the
preamble,
and
that's...
and
you're
interpreting
the
statute
with
that.
and
it
isn't
customary
for
this
court
to
take
words
that
don't
appear
in
the
text
of
the
statute
and
read
them
in,
based
on
some
statement
of
purpose
or
preamble.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
is
saying
one
thing
more.
he
is
saying
it's
also
highly
unlikely
that
the
55-year-old
has
worked
as
long
subject
to
risk
at
the
point
at
which
the
calculation
is
made
than
is
the
case
with
the
person
who
retires
on
the
basis
of
20
years.
and
so
that
there
is
a
tradeoff.
and,
therefore,
you
constantly
analyze
this
as
the
kind
of
garden
variety
of
discrimination
based
on
age
which
congress
was
aiming
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
i
didn't
get
it
either.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
are
exactly
the
same
people.
the
only
thing
that
distinguishes
the
one
class,
those
who
voluntarily
do
and
those
who
are
disabled,
is
happenstance;
and
the
happenstance
is
disability
in
the
line
of
service.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
reason
for
that
is
that
we
accept
the
criterion
at
the
outset
that
your
pay
bears
some
relationship
to
what
you
do.
we
are
now
in
a
situation
in
which
the
benefit
does
not
bear
a
relationship
to
what
you
are
doing
or
going
to
do.
