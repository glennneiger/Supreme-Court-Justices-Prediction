that
would
be
a
good
argument
if
the
sole
basis
for
retirement
under
your
system
was
years
of
service,
but
it's
not
just
years
of
service,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
can't
take
your...
you
couldn't
take
your
statute
and
erase
all
the
references
to
age
and
have
the
statute
work,
could
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
because
the
ada
expressly
allows
them
to
do
that;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
kentucky
is
trying
to
do
is
to,
at
least
in
part,
provide
make-whole
benefits
for
a
police
officer
who
becomes
disabled
below
the
age
of
55.
so
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
say
we
want
to
give
you
the
benefit
that
you
would
have
received
if
you
had
not
been
hurt
on
the
job
and
therefore
unable
to
work
and
had
been
able
to
work
to
the
normal
retirement
age.
now,
if
that's
correct,
is
that
an
illegitimate
objective?
and
if
it's
not
an
illegitimate
objective,
is
there
any
way
that
they
can
do
that
consistent
with
your
understanding
of
the
adea?
because
when
someone
is
over
the
retirement
age,
it's
rather
hard
to
see
how
many
years
you
would
add
on
projecting
how
long
that
person
would
continue
to
work
beyond
the
age
of
retirement
eligibility.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
they
want
to
do
that
and
they
have
a
case
of
a
police
officer
who
works
beyond
55...
the
officer
is
55-plus
with
10
years
of
service
and
then
becomes
disabled...
you
say
they
have
to
give
that
person
10
years
of
credit.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
do
you
that,
aren't
you
going
to
be...
you're
going
to
be
undercompensating
the
younger
person
who
gets
disabled
and
overcompensating
the
people
over
55
who
gets
disabled
who
may
not...
it
may
not
be
realistic
to
think
that
someone's
going
to
continue
to
work
as
a
police
officer
until
65.
i
don't
know.
