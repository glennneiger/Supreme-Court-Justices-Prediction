mr.
robert
d.
klausner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
retirement
eligibility
in
kentucky
is
based
on
20
years
of
service
or
age
55.
age
is
not
the
only
determinant.
and
"age"
is
not
a
bad
word.
as
justice
white
said
in
mcmann
v.
united
airlines,
all
retirement
plans
necessarily
make
distinctions
based
on
age.
here
it
is
age
or
service.
and
the
eeoc's
focus
on
age
alone
fails
to
appreciate
that
kentucky
is
an
integrated,
consolidated
retirement
plan
with
the
goal
of
providing
benefits
to
all
qualified
workers.
to
say,
as
the
eeoc
does,
that
all
younger
workers
will
always
fare
better
than
all
older
workers
is
factually
wrong,
and
it
fails
to
appreciate
the
myriad
factors
that
go
into
determining
pension
amounts.
it's
not
age
alone
that
determines
the
result.
age
is
a
factor.
it's
not
the
factor.
the
plan
is
not
facially
discriminatory,
it's
not
arbitrary,
and
it
doesn't
violate--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--no,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--if
the
eeoc's
chart
were...
correct,
that
would
be
true,
your
honor,
limited
only
to
the
amount
of
imputed
service.
the
person
who
began
younger
in
the
example
which
your
honor
used
would
get
more
imputed
service.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
no,
your
honor.
that's
only
in
the
case
of
disability.
in
a
normal
requirement
setting,
one
works
a
number
of
years
and
you
get
two
and-a-half
percent
of
your
salary
for
each
year
that
you
worked.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
that's
right.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
they
impute...
yes,
your
honor.
they
impute
the
additional
service
to
you.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
it's
only
partially
right,
mr.
justice.
justice
breyer,
the
reason
that
you
get
additional
before
age
55
is
the
same
as
the
reason
why
you
get
extra
before
you
reach
20
years.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
your
only
partially--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--the
difference
is
that
the
imputed
service
comes
before
55,
because
you're
not
eligible
for
after
55
or
after
20
years
you
are
eligible
for
benefits--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--if
you
were
disabled
before
normal
retirement,
you
receive
imputed
service.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
correct.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
the
reason
for
that,
justice
breyer,
is
as
follows:
the
person
who's
49
and
gets
disabled,
assuming
he
does
not
have...
he
or
she
doesn't
have
20
years
of
service,
can't
retire.
the
person
who
is
55
in
your
example
can
leave
tomorrow.
additionally,
the
person
who
begins
work
older
starts
out
closer
to
retirement.
we
are
not
talking
about
two
different
groups
of
people.
the
plan
favors
the
older
worker
by
saying
on
the
day
you
begin
work,
you're
always
closer
to
retiring
than
a
younger
person.
the
purpose
of
the
imputed
service
is
to
try
to
replicate
as
closely
as
possible
within
some
financial
limits
set
by
the...
by
the
general
assembly
of
kentucky
what
you
would
have
received
had
you
made--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--my
response,
justice,
is
this.
they
start
out
un-alike.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
person
who
was
in
55
in
your
example,
a,
is
already
eligible
for
benefit.
he
doesn't
have
to
wait
to
be
disabled.
he
may
leave
tomorrow.
the
person
who
starts
younger,
particularly
in
a
public
safety
retirement
plan,
spends
more
time
in
the
line
of
fire
than
the
person
who
starts
older.
the
person
who
starts
older
takes
advantage
of
the
fact
that
in
this
retirement
plan
you
can
retire
with
as
little
as
five
years
of
service.
actually
a
person
who
is
55
is
eligible
for
a
benefit
after
only
a
month.
in
fact,
kentucky
may
be
the
only
plan
in
the
country
that
does
that.
but
where
they
don't
start
out
alike
and
where
the
eeoc's
chart
is
based
on
fallacy
is
that
the
person
who
began
older
in
work
in
your
example
was
always
closer
to
retirement,
they
needed
less
years.
the
purpose
of
the
plan
for
disability
purposes,
which
is
not
a
separate
plan,
it's
simply
a
means
of
getting
one
to
normal
retirement
who
is
not
otherwise
eligible.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
respectfully,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that's
not
entirely
correct,
for
this
reason.
the
plan
makes
the
determination
of
eligible
to
retire
on
20
years
or
age
55
with
five
years.
in
other
words,
it
makes
the
determination
not
based
on
age
but
on
pension
status,
that
is,
eligibility
to
receive
an
unreduced
normal
retirement.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
right.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
as
i
noted
before,
it's
about
retirement
eligibility,
not
about
age.
in
hazen
paper
you
dealt
with
the
question
of
an
individual
who
was
fired
because
they
were
about
to
meet
the
10-year
vesting
requirement
in
a
private
sector
plan.
the
person
was
also
over
the
age
of
40.
the
court
found
that
it
wasn't
an
age
discrimination
case
because
it
said
that
age
was
merely
correlated
with
what
the
court
called
pension
status.
i
think
pension
status
and
retirement
eligibility,
which
can
occur
at
20
years
or
it
can
occur
at
age
55
with
some
service,
is
exactly
the
same.
in--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--that's
correct,
justice.
one
needs
some
service,
but
one
may
retire
at
55
or
one
may
retire
at
20
years.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
no.
and
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
pension
statutes
are
required
to
eliminate
any
use
of
age
at
all.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
the
ada
is
designed
to
eliminate
arbitrary
age
discrimination.
that
is
where
the
design
of
the
plan
is
motivated
by
a
policy
of
the
employer
to
discriminate,
to
provide
less
solely
because
of
the
individual's
age.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
aware
that
the
preamble
alone
doesn't
direct,
and
i
understand
that
the
operative
language
is
in
623(a).
but
i
think
that
the--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--i
think,
justice,
the
legislative
history
is
important
for
this
reason.
when
title
vii
was
first
written
age
was
included
and
then
it
was
taken
out,
and
there
was
a
reason
why
it
was
taken
out:
because
there
is
never
a
reason
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
there
is
never
a
reason
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
national
origin
or
religion;
but
in
government
retirement
plans,
which
are
paid
for
life
and
in
which
the
calculation
is
determined
in
part
on
age,
on
how
long
someone
will
live
and
how
long
they've
worked
and
that
interrelationship,
i
think
congress
recognized
age
is
qualitatively
different.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
justice
ginsburg,
i
understand
this
court's
holding
in
cline
was
that
the
statute
is
intended
to
protect
the
relatively
older
as
it
relates
to
the
relatively
younger.
but
you
also
said
in
cline
that
age
is
qualitatively
different,
because
what
gives
age
reason
in
terms
of
discrimination
is
when
it's
arbitrary.
that
is,
when
it
is
invidious,
and
that's
the
distinction
between
the
title
vii
cases
that
the
government
relies
on,
and
why
i
think
hazen
paper
is
important,
because,
as
the
court
said,
unless
you
can
show
in
a
disparate
treatment
case
that
the
policy
is
motivated
by
age,
then
i
think
that
the...
the
intent
goes.
and
the...
one
cannot
draw
from
the
face
of
the
kentucky
statute...
and
that's
what
this
is;
this
was
a
challenge
that
said
the
statute
discriminates
on
its
face...
that
the
only
inference
that
one
can
have
is
that
the
design
of
the
plan
is
motivated
to
pay
older
people
less.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
that
is
correct,
but
justice
ginsburg,
that
type
of
disability
is
not
the
disability
which
was
at
issue
in
this
particular
case.
that
is
for
a
person
who
is
disabled
from
any
ability
to
work,
period,
in
other
words,
the
social
security
standard
of
disability.
the
disability
at
issue
in
this
case
was
the
inability
to
work
as
a
public
safety
officer,
in
this
case
a
police
officer.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
that's
correct.
this
isn't,
for
example,
a
stand-alone
disability
insurance
policy.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
it
is
common
subject
to
everyone
in
the
plan
without--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--and
i...
you
certainly
said
it
better
than
i
did,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
disability
fills
in...
it
covers
a
gap.
disability
is
designed
to
cover
you
in
most
instances
from
the
time
you
get
five
years
of
service...
and
by
the
way,
you're
uncovered
in
this
plan
for
disability
for
the
first
five
years
of
employment
except
for
a
very
limited,
specific
number
of
instances
in
which
only
total
disability
from
all
work
applies.
so
in
the
case
of
the
individual
who
the--
eeoc
talks
about
as
having
been
discriminated
against,
if
you
were
a
younger
worker
for
the
first
five
years
of
employment
you
would
have
been
not
covered.
a
55...
for
any
benefit
at
all.
a
person
who
starts
at
21
and
gets
disabled
from
work
as
a
police
officer
or
firefighter
for
the
first
five
years
of
employment
has
no
protection
at
all.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
no,
ma'am.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
imputed
services.
and
it's
essentially...
we
say
if
during
this
gap
of
time
before
normal
retirement,
this
risk
that's
covered,
that
if
this
disabling
event
occurs,
we
advance
you
to
normal
retirement
immediately
and
try
to
replicate
as
closely
as
possible
the
benefit
that
one
would
have
achieved
had
you
worked
to
the
closest--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--point
of
eligibility.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
is
the
person
who
has
either
20
years
or
is
55
on
the
day
they
become
disabled
is
already
eligible
to
retire.
the
plan
is
a
single
plan
that
provides
a
benefit.
if
you
start
older,
you
have
to
work
less
to
get
there.
by
the
same
token,
by
starting
closer
to
retirement
you
need
less
added
to
your
balance
to
bring
you
to
normal
retirement.
in
the
example--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--there's
reasons
why
that
isn't
done.
number
one,
to
follow
your
example,
justice
breyer,
for
current
employees,
people
hired
before
2004,
of
which
there
were
several
hundred
thousand,
you'd
have
to
lower
the
benefit
to
follow
your
example.
the
kentucky
constitution
forbids
lowering
the
benefits.
actually,
the
commonwealth,
in
response
to
the
liability
in
this
case,
did
change
the
disability
benefit.
for
people
hired
after
2004,
they
slashed
its
economic
value
substantially,
and
now
everybody
just
gets
a
certain
amount
of
disability.
it
doesn't,
however,
accomplish
the
commonwealth's
goal
of
attracting
and
retaining
employees
to
do
hazardous
duty
jobs.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
much
lower.
it's
a
substantial
reduction.
they
just
get
a
small
piece
of
change.
it's
interesting,
you
know,
in
the
federal
civil
service
retirement
system,
the
police
officers,
for
example,
who
work
in
this
court,
if
they
become
disabled,
they
have
imputed
service
to
an
age.
it's
a
very
similar
system.
in
fact,
all
employees
in
both
fers,
the
federal
employees'
retirement
system,
and
the
civil
service
employees'
retirement
system,
both
participate
in
a
program
where
age
is
imputed
to
normal
retirement.
it's
a
common
practice,
as
the
court
can
see
from
the
amicus
briefs.
it's
a
common
practice
throughout
the
united
states.
i
think--
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
--you
may
get
to
this
result
in
this
way:
if
you
determine
that
age
is
not
the
driver,
that
is,
that
because
you
have
a
plan
that
has
normal
retirement
based
on
service
alone,
a
38-year-old
employee
who
gets
disabled
with
18
years
of
service
gets
two
years
of
imputed
service.
the
45-year-old,
in
your
example,
who
started
at
35
would
get
10
years.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
i
think
your
honor
you
can
reach
the
result
in
this
way.
the
statute
was
challenged
as
being
facially
discriminatory,
and
i
think
under
this
court's
precedents
for
facial
discrimination,
one
would
have
to
say
that
the
only
reasonable
inference
in
the
statute,
by
its
mere
use
of
age,
is
that
you
say
that
it
starts
out
presumptively
discriminatory.
what
the
government
has
really
argued
here
is
an
as-applied
circumstance.
they
said
the
effect
of
the
statute
in
certain
cases,
and
in
those
circumstances
the
statute
would
stand
on
its
face
and
if
there
is
a
circumstance
in
which
someone
effectively
is
discriminated,
then
you
look
to
see
are
there
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
that
effect...
that
take
effect
in
this
instance?
secondly,
i
think
the
court
can
determine...
and
i
think
this
is
the
question
that
is
the
next
step
after
hazen,
where
you
said
that
age
correlated
with
pension
status,
in
that
case
being
vested
for
10
years.
the
question
is,
if
a
plan
has
eligibility
to
retire
as
its
motivation,
that
is,
it
is
service
regardless
of
age
or
age
plus
service,
is
it
really
motivated
by
age?
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
kennedy,
clearly
is
no.
the
one
thing
i
would
add
is
if
you
look
at
the
statute
in
betts,
the
ohio
case,
which
is
the
last
time
an
age
case
on
a
public
plan
got
to
this
court,
in
the
ohio
plan
you
couldn't
get
a
disability
because
you
were
60,
but
you
could
also
retire
in
that
plan
just
like
kentucky
on
years
of
service
alone,
but
a
years-of-service
retiree
in
ohio
could
get
a
disability.
that's
not
true
in
kentucky.
somebody
who
starts
as
a
firefighter
at
18
no
longer
has
disability
protection
at
38
years
old.
a
person
who
starts
as
a
police
officer
at
45
retains
disability
coverage
until
they're
55.
i
think...
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
alone
enables
you
to
get
there.
and
i
think
to
get
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question...
and
i
don't
believe
i
fully
answered
on
this
issue
of
the
role
of
the
word
"arbitrary"
in
the
statute...
i
think
that
that
gives
that
word
meaning,
not
just
because
it's
in
the
preamble,
but
because
it's
in
the
legislative
history,
and
the
evil
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
to
is
what
is
it
that
we're
trying
to
prevent?
we're
trying
to
create
job
opportunities
for
older
workers,
and
what
congress
said
after
betts
is
you
want
to
make
sure
benefit
plans
are
covered.
and
i
think
kentucky
has
accomplished
both.
it
doesn't
use
a
retirement
age,
as
many
employers
do.
again,
the
federal
government
forces
police
officers
and
firefighters
out
of
their
jobs.
firefighters
at
55,
police
officers
at
57.
kentucky
doesn't.
the
program
doesn't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age.
if
there's
no
question,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
d.
klausner
i'd
like
to
start
back
where
we
just
left
off
with
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
the
guaranteed
benefit.
if
a
person
is
38
years
old
and
has
20
years
of
service,
that
benefit
is
not
available.
if
you're
50
years
old
with
5
years
of
service,
the
benefit
is
available.
the
benefit
is
not
available
to
the
38-year-old
because
that
person
is
eligible
to
retire
on
a
normal
retirement
benefit.
age
isn't
the
driver.
eligibility
for
retirement
is
the
motivation.
and
while
my
brother
says
that
congress
wanted
to
overturn
betts,
what
they
wanted
to
overturn
in
betts
was
the
language
in
this
court's
decision
that
cast
doubt
on
whether
pension
plans
were
generally
covered
by
the
language
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
and
the
older
workers
benefits
protection
act,
if
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history,
was
focused
far
less
on
what
happened
in
a
public
employee
retirement
system.
the
real
issue
that
congress
focused
on,
if
one
looks
at
the
house
and
senate
reports,
is
they
said
there
is
a
problem
in
private
industry
in
the
rust
belt
that
normal
retirement
eligibility
is
being
used
to
force
people
not
to
get
some
other
benefit
in
some
other
stand-alone
plan.
that's
not
the
issue
here.
and
the
plan
in
betts
is
no
more
like
kentucky's
plan
than
the
thurston
plan.
in
thurston,
the
pilot
case,
no
pilot
over
60,
no
matter
how
skillful,
had
bumping
rights
to
be
a
flight
engineer.
in
kentucky,
one
with
20
years
of
service,
regardless
of
age,
is
in
the
same
posture
as
someone
who
is
55
with
a
minimum
service.
my
brother
also
pointed
you
to
a
provision
in
the
kentucky
statute
on
pages
7a
and...
page
7a
in
the
appendix.
look
also
at
2a,
which
defines
normal
retirement
to
be
55
with
5
years
of
service,
or
20
years
of
service
regardless
of
age.
the
methodology
for
determining
disability
in
this
case
is
exactly
the
same.
it's
based
on
your
proximity
to
normal
retirement,
not
based
on
your
age.
one
example
was
given.
if
a
person
is
45
years
old
with
4
years
of
service
and
became
disabled,
that
person
would
get
nothing
because
they
haven't
met
the
five-year
service
requirement.
but
a
55-year-old
with
4
years
of
service
has
a
normal
retirement
benefit.
it's
about
limited
government
resources
not
being
duplicated,
and
perhaps
that's
the
reason
why
the
eeoc
adopted
its
regulation
on
december
26th
coordinating
retiree
health
care.
the
rationale
they
gave
was
we
looked
at
all
the...
all
the
ways
to
do
this,
and
we
couldn't
come
up
with
a
reason
to
do
it
any
other
way.
in
the
sixth
circuit
federal
argument,
judge
boggs
noted
in
his
dissent...
chief
judge
boggs
noted
he
asked
the
eeoc
for
a
reason
on
how
to
fix
this,
and
they
couldn't
give
him
one.
what
this
case
is
about
is
about
being
fair
to
workers
without
regard
to
age.
all
the
people
who
run
these
plans,
who
fund
these
plans,
who
are
in
these
plans,
are
all
lined
up
on
kentucky's
side
of
the
table.
that
should
tell
you
that
it's
neither
arbitrary
nor
discriminatory.
the
plan
is
fair,
and
the
plan
does
not
violate
the
law.
we
ask
you
to
reverse
the
decision
below
and
reinstate
the
district
court's
original
final
summary
judgment.
thank
you.
