this
has
been
very
helpful,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
to
raise
a
question
about
the
fairness
of
your
opening
statement.
you
began
by
saying
something
to
the
effect
that
this
does
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age.
it
does.
age
is
the
explicit
factor
that
the
statute
uses
in
order
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question.
and
the
act
does
not
prohibit
the
use
of
age
in
all
circumstances
to
which
it
applies,
but
it
does...
the
act
goes
on
to
prohibit
the
use
of
age
in
some
of
the
circumstances.
and
one
of
those
circumstances
is
the
hypothetical
of
the
55-plus-year-old
person
used
in
justice
breyer's
statement
and
example.
so,
it
is
not
correct,
it
seems
to
me,
for
you
to
say
that
this
does
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age.
now,
maybe
there
is
some
good
reasons
for
doing
that,
you
can
get
into
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
does
make
an
explicit
determination
based
on
age
as
to
some
people.

suppose
i
can't
make
that
assumption
or
adopt
that
premise.
is
there
another
basis
on
which
to
reach
the
result?
i
think
this
does
explicitly
discriminate
based
on
age
as
to
some
people,
and
you're
telling
me
you
don't
want
me
to
do
that.
but
suppose
i
don't
agree
with
you.
is
there
some
other
way
to
reach
the
result?
