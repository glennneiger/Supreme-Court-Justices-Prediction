justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
the
part
that
they
are
saying
is
arbitrary
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
appreciate
your
correcting
me
if
i
don't
understand
it
correctly,
is
that
you
get
double
your
pension
at
55
if
you've
worked
20
years
as
opposed
to
10.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
worker
who
has
been
there,
he's
qualified,
he
has
only
worked
for
10
years
and
now
he's
55
years
old.
there
is
a
chart
in
the
sg's
brief,
and
as
i
read
that
chart,
he
got
amount
"x".
he
started
at
45,
he
ended
up
at
55,
he
gets
"x".
if
he
started
at
35
and
worked
for
20
years,
he
would
get
much
more
than
"x".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
would
get
20
years
rather
than
10;
is
that
right?
i'm
not
talking
about
a
disabled
person.
i'm
talking
about
anybody.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
a
person
works
for
20
years,
he
gets
more
than
if
he
worked
for
10
years;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
he
is
disabled.
and
when
he's
disabled,
if
he's
disabled
after
working
only
10
and
he
is
45
years
old,
they
pretend
he
had
worked
the
full
20?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
i
understand
it.
now,
this
individual
says,
i
was
working
there
after
the
age
of
55,
i
only
worked
for
14
years,
now
i
become
disabled.
if
i
become
disabled
before
i
was
55,
let's
say
i
had
six
years
to
go,
they
would
give
me
six
years
extra.
but
because
i
was
disabled
after
i'm
55,
i
get
nothing
extra.
nothing
is
imputed.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
ask
you
for
the
reasons.
i
want
to
know
if
i'm
factually
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
am
i
factually
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
giving
me
reasons.
i'll
ask
you
in
a
second
for
the
reasons.
i
want
to
know
if
what
i
said
is
factually
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
not
after?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now
i'll
say
that
i
think
is
the
discrimination
of
which
he
is
complaining.
and
now
what
he
would
like
to
know
is
what
possible
reason
is
there
for
that
difference?
now
i'd
like
to
hear
what
the
reason
is
that
justifies
that
difference.
you
give
him
six
extra
years
when
he
retired
after
14
years
and
though
he
was
only
49
years
old,
and
you
don't
give
him
even
one
extra
year
when
everything
else
was
the
same
but
he
retired
after
he
was
55.
now,
explain
to
me
what
the
reason
is
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
he
says
now,
what
he
says
to
that,
i
take
it,
is
fine.
he
is
49
years
old.
he
has
six
years
to
go
to
qualify
for
retirement,
so
let
him
retire.
if
you
let
him
retire,
and
you
gave
him
14
years
of
credit,
you
would
be
treating
him
just
like
you're
treating
me.
but
in
addition
to
letting
him
retire,
you
give
him
six
extra
years
of
credit,
which
at
two
and-a-half
percent
per
year.
good,
i'm
glad
you
do
that.
give
me
the
six
extra
years
at
two
and-a-half
percent
as
well.
treat
us
alike.
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
the
point,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there...
that's
what
the
complaint
is,
i
think,
that
you
say
it's
the
second
part
that
you
just
said.
what
you
do
when
the
person
is
disabled
and
he
is
not
yet
55...
he
hasn't
qualified
yet...
is
you
both
qualify
him,
and
when
you
qualify
him
you
give
him
credit
for
years
he
hasn't
worked.
now,
the
older
person
who
is
still
working
and
is
also
disabled
says:
fine,
you
let
me
retire,
but
you
don't
give
me
any
extra
years.
now
that's
the
complaint,
i
think.
so
that
if
you
had
a
person
who
had
started
at
45,
eligible
to
retire
at
55,
works
for
4
years
and
becomes
disabled,
he
is
credited
with
14
years;
while
the
person
who
started
at
35
and
at
45
becomes
disabled,
he
is
given
20
years.
he
is
given
the
10
extra
years.
so
the
first
person,
older
person,
says:
you
gave
him
some
extra
years;
you
didn't
have
to
give
him
those
extra
years
in
order
to
qualify
him
to
retire.
you
could
have
just
said
you
can
retire,
but
you
gave
him
10
extra
years
and
you
give
me
no
extra
years.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
need
anything
to
bring
you
to
normal
retirement.
you
could
rewrite
the
plan
and
say
when
a
person
becomes
disabled
you
get
retirement,
right
at
that
moment.
you
could
say
that.
and
what
the
plaintiff
is
saying
is,
why
don't
you
say
that?
though
it's
a
bit
mean.
but
i
think
what
he
would
probably
like
is
you
would
extend
the
extra
years
to
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
that's
why
i
think
the
result
in
this
case
is
just
terrible.
i
think
it
takes
disabled
people
and
cuts
their
benefits
with
no
benefit.
i
cannot
believe
for
two
minutes
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
result.
but
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question
was
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
to
get
to
that
result
under
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
ask
you
this
sort
of
basic
question:
does
it
use
age
any
differently
than
it
uses
years
of
service?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
wrong
with
using
that
as
a
benchmark?
if
you
can
fire
a
person
when
he
is
55,
why
can't
you
use
it
as
a
benchmark
as
to
how
much
you're
going
to
give
a
disability
person
on
pension?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
lesser
or
greater...
this
would
be
an
instance
where
greater
includes
lesser
for
the
reason
that
this
lesser
business
has
no
stereotypes.
all
they're
trying
to
do
is
to
help
people
who
are
disabled
at
a
time
when
they
are
younger
and
probably
have
fairly
good
expenses,
and
everybody
gets
this
kind
of
insurance.
and
this
man
who
is
the
plaintiff
here
had
it,
too,
while
he
was
there.
so
it's
true
you
are
really
using
in
a
minimal
sense
age,
but
you
are
doing
it
in
a
statute
that
permits
you
to
do
it
because
it's
a
lesser
version
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
it's
inapplicable.
i
wasn't
saying
it's
inapplicable.
what
i
am
worried
about...
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
people
using
absolutely
mechanical
rules,
and
particularly
when
you
talk
about
pension
systems,
which,
of
course,
age
is
relevant
to
a
pension
system,
and
what
they
do
is
find
comparisons;
and,
before
you
know
it,
you
are
in
the
kind
of
a...
of
a
hamburger
situation
where
it's
so
chopped
up
that
perfectly
worthwhile
things
are
forbidden.
and
this
would
seem
to
be
a
number
1
exhibit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because
what
you
are
looking
at
is
to
see
whether
the
purpose
of
congress
is
somehow
implicated,
a
purpose
designed
to
prevent
stereotypical
thinking
from
being
used
to
put
older
people
at
a
disadvantage.
and
there
is
no
indication
that
this
is
so
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what's
the
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
this
idea,
which
is...
would
this
wreck
the
statute?
you
say
we're
talking
about
age,
which
is
not
an
immutable
characteristic.
everybody
goes
through
it.
everybody
is
younger,
everybody
is
older.
and
therefore
we
take
the
word
"discriminate"
and
the
word
"discriminate"
in
this
context,
when
considered
in
terms
of
pension
requirements,
which
inevitably
are
age
mixed
to
a
considerable
degree,
means
that
if
there
are
plausible
justifications
and
no
significant
reason
for
thinking
that
it
reflects
stereotypical
thinking,
that
it
does
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
word
"discriminate".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
started
out
by
saying,
that's
why
i
said
that
this
is
not
an
immutable
characteristic,
and
it
is...
that's
why
i
put
all
the
qualifications
in
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
be
the
same
as...
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
now...
i'm
thinking
the
problem
is
we
are
going
into
the
package;
we
are
starting
opening
up
the
package
that
the
55-year-old
retiree
normally
gets.
suppose
they
said
this:
here's
what
we'll
do
to
the
disabled
person.
we'll
treat
him
just
as
if
he
retired
at
55.
he
is
only
35;
and,
moreover,
at
55
when
you
retire
in
our
police
force,
we
give
you
a
big
party
and
a
gold
watch.
well,
we
don't
do
that
if
you
retire
later
on.
same
kind
of
claim.
why
not?
over
65
years
old,
he
retired.
hey,
you
didn't
give
him
the
gold
watch.
why
did
you
give
the
other
person
the
gold
watch?
you
said
the
reason
is
we
treat
them
all
like
we
treat
them
when
you
retire
at
55.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
fair,
that
you
don't
understand.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
now,
the
second
one,
kentucky
retirement
systems
v.
eeoc
is
more
complicated.
it
involves
a
very
complicated
retirement
pension
system
that
kentucky
has
so
i'll
simplify
it
for
discussion
and
if
you
want
the
whole
complication,
you
have
to
read
the
opinion.
the
system
permits,
but
it
doesn't
require,
certain
workers
like
policemen
to
retire
at
age
55
and
get
a
pension.
now,
for
a
worker
who
becomes
seriously
disabled
before
he
be
60
–
before
he
becomes
55,
he
gets
a
pension
too
because
kentucky
does
that
by
pretending
that
the
worker
had
worked
till
the
age
of
55.
so
he
gives
the
--
they
give
the
worker
credit
for
years
of
work
that
he
didn't
actually
work
and
i
call
those
phantom
years.
and
if
you're
disabled
before
you're
55,
you
get
these
phantom
years
to
bring
you
up
to
the
age
55
and
then
they
figure
out
what
the
pension
would
have
been
if
he'd
really
done
it.
well
in
this
case,
a
worker
became
seriously
disabled
after
he
was
55
and
eligible
for
a
pension.
and
he
complains
that
kentucky
system
amounts
to
age
discrimination.
he
points
out
that
kentucky
would
give
55
--
give
phantom
years
to
a
worker
who
became
disabled
before
he
reach
55,
"but
what
about
me?"
he
says,
"i
–
i
reached
55
and
then
i
became
disabled
so
i
don't
get
any
phantom
years.
that's
seems
like
age
discrimination
just
based
on
the
fact
that
whether
you
are
older
or
younger
than
55."
now,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that,
but
we
don't
agree
with
that,
we
reverse.
“we
agree
that
kentucky
treated
the
two
workers
differently,
but
we
don't
think
that
difference
amounts
to
discrimination
because
of
age."
those
are
the
words
of
the
adea,
that's
what
the
adea
forbids,
discrimination
because
of
age.
"rather,
we
think
what's
going
on
is
that
kentucky
is
simply
trying
to
give
a
pension
to
workers
who
became
disabled
before
they
reached
retirement
age."
kentucky
gives
the
phantom
years
to
those
workers
because
otherwise
they
couldn't
qualify
for
a
pension.
kentucky
doesn't
give
phantom
years
to
workers
who
became
disabled
after
they
reach
say
55
because
those
workers
already
have
qualified
for
a
pension.
they
don't
need
any
phantom
years
to
become
qualified.
so,
age
is
certainly
a
factor
that
ordinarily
qualifies
workers
for
a
pension,
but
it
is
pension
status,
"are
you,
mister
disabled
worker,
already
qualified
for
a
pension
or
not
already
qualified
for
a
pension?"
that's
what
matters
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
phantom
years
are
added.
that
is
what
explains
the
difference
in
treatment.
so,
age
is
in
a
sense
an
artifact
of
the
pension
eligibility
rules.
it
is
not
the
reason
or
even
a
reason
for
the
discrimination.
so,
we
conclude
kentucky
systems
does
not
embody
the
sort
of
discrimination
that
congress
sought
to
eliminate
in
the
adea,
and
so
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
statute's
prohibition.
now,
we
have
been
pretty
careful
to
limit
our
holding
to
this
quite
special
case
of
differential
treatment
based
on
pension
status,
and
pension
status
is
a
circumstance
that
the
adea
and
the
social
security
law
too
both
treat
as
special,
specifically
authorizing
age-related
rules
that
in
other
areas
they
might
bar.
now,
we
also
list
in
a
number
of
other
features,
quite
a
few
features
of
this
case
that
make
it
special
for
age
discrimination
purposes.
the
upshot
is
that
where
an
employer
treats
employees
differently
based
on
their
pension
status
and
even
if
the
pension
status
does
depend
on
age,
the
plaintiff
still
has
to
show
that
that
age
made
a
difference
rather
than
just
a
pension
status,
that
it
was
actually
motivated
this
discrimination
or
there's
a
reason
for
it
that
was
based
upon
age
and
not
pension
status.
now,
we
explain
this
--
it's
more
complex
even
than
i've
suggested
and
we
explained
it
all
in
our
decision.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
with
which
justices
scalia,
ginsburg,
and
alito
have
joined.
