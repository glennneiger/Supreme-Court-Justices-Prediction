excuse
me.
it
wasn't
contested
in
smith?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
go
back
over
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
it
have
been
said
in
smith
that...
that
trading
it
for
drugs
was
not
the
only
way
in
which
the
offense
could
have
been
committed?
couldn't
the
same
thing
have
been
said
in
smith?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
issue
in
smith
was
weapon
versus
nonweapon,
and
that's
not
what
you're
arguing
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
here
is
use
versus
nonuse,
active
employment
versus
passive
receipt?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
are
making
his
argument.
i
think
you're...
you're
too
humble,
the
argument
you're
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
of
course,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
bailey,
i
suppose.
you
know,
what
was
there
in
bailey
except...
what
was
the
term,
linguistic...
nothing
but
a
linguistic
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
bailey
doesn't
make
any
more
sense
either
from
a
policy
standpoint.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
sometimes
we
rely
on
linguistics,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
sometimes
the
words
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
enough
to
say
we
don't
usually
talk
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
end
of
it.
we
don't
talk
that
way.
we
don't
say
use
a
car
when
you
buy
a
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
wouldn't
making
a
material
misstatement
in
order
to
obtain
a
gun
constitute
a
use
of
the
gun...
as
much
as
it,
the
receipt
of
the
gun
constitutes
a
use
of
the
gun
here?
what's
the
difference
between
the
two
situations?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
you
believe
smith.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
you
believe
smith.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
there's...
they
refer
to
crimes
in
which
there
has
been
a
receipt
but
there
has
also
been
a
conveyance.
why
do
you
focus
on
the
receiver
rather
than
the
conveyer?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
involved
in...
that
broadens
that
enormously,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
be...
it
could
have...
it
is
intended
to
be
used,
not
necessarily.
as...
as
your
opponent
pointed
out,
this
section
does
not
focus
on
the
individual.
it
focuses
on
the
firearm,
simply
for...
for
confiscation
of
the
firearm.
and,
therefore,
it
suffices
if
either
side
intended
it
to
be
used.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
recipient
who
intended
it
to
be
used
even
though
it's
a
receipt
crime.
it
was
intended
to
be
used
by
the
other
side.
wouldn't
that
make
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
page
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
were
doubtful
about
whether
the
"possession"
thing
applies
here.
i
don't
know.
possesses
a
firearm
in
furtherance
of
the
crime...
i
mean,
the
crime
has
been
completed
by
the
time
the...
the
person
who
is
receiving
the
gun
has
possession
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
hard
to
say
it's
in
furtherance
of
the
crime
when
the
crime
is
over
once
he
gets
it.
his
possession
is
not
in
furtherance
of
the
crime,
it
seems
to
me.
it's
the
other
person's
possession
that's
in
furtherance
of
the
crime.
he
possesses
it
so
he
can
turn
it
over,
which
is
the
crime.
but
i
mean
i'm
just
not
all
that
sure
that
you
have
a
hundred
percent
easy
case
on
the
possession
point.
