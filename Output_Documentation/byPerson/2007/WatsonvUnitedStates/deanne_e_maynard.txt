ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
used
the
firearm
by
accepting
it
in
exchange
for
his
drugs.
in
doing
so
petitioner
used
it
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime.
although
the
situation
in
smith
was
different,
the
principle
of
smith
is
that
use
of
a
firearm
as
an
item
of
trade
or
commerce...
specifically
used
as
the
medium
of
exchange...
is
a
use
falling
within
the
meaning
of
section
924(c).
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
and
the
petitioner
did
use
it
here,
your
honor.
in
agreeing
to
take
it
in
exchange
for
a
certain
amount
of
his
drugs--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
you
buy
the
car,
then
you
have
used
the
car
as
an
item
of
trade
or
commerce
during
or
in
relation
to
that
commercial
transaction.
we
don't
usually
talk
that
way
but
we
do...
and
one
can--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
as
long
as--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well
here,
your
honor,
it's
important
to
put
it
into
statutory
context,
of
course,
and
the
statutory
context
asks
whether
or
not
one
has
used
the
firearm
during
or
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime,
here
a
drug
transaction.
and
i
do--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
one
can
employ
use
in
a
natural
way
to
mean
receipt
in
the
way
that
petitioner
used
the
firearm
here.
the
subway
system
uses
tokens.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
used
the
gun
as
a
medium
of
exchange
to
sell
my
drugs.
just
in
the
same
way
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
believe
in
any
barter
transaction,
your
honor,
in
particular,
where
one
side
has
said
as
they
negotiate
it
out,
i
will
sell
you
this
amount
of
drugs
for
this
particular
firearm,
then
both
have
used
the
gun
as
the
medium
of
exchange--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--and...
and
the
drug
dealer
used
the
gun
as
the
medium
of
exchange
to
complete
his
drug
sale,
and
i
do
think
we
do
sometimes
use
"use"
in
that
way,
justice
stevens.
the
subway
system
uses
tokens.
the
metro
system.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well
in
a--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--you
would
have
certainly
used--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
sword
as
weapon.
there
is
no
exchange
there,
your
honor.
here
it's
crucial,
because
you
have
during
your
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime,
which
here
is
the
drug
exchange,
just
like
in
smith.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
he
agrees
to
trade
his
drugs
for
the
gun
as
the
currency
to
close
the
drug
transaction,
i
believe
he
has
used
the
gun
in
the
way
that
we
normally
use
the
word.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no.
i
think
the...
i
think
the
crime
is
the
taking
of
the
firearm
in
exchange
for
the
drugs.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
one
could
make
the
argument,
justice
souter,
that
an
agreement
alone
is
a
use
once,
one
agrees
to
use
the
gun
as
the
medium
of
exchange
to
sell
one's
drugs.
the
government
is
not
pressing
that
point
here
today
and
we
don't,
and
the
court
need
not
go
that
far
because
here
petitioner
did
receive
the
drugs,
and
the
reason
that
possibly
the
agreement
line
goes
too
far
is
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
smith
where
the
court
pointed
out
that
someone
who
makes
a
material
misstatement
in
order
to
acquire
a
gun
is
clearly
not
using
the
gun,
but
the
court
gave
examples
of
receipt
offenses
in,
in
the
forfeiture
provisions
in
section
924(d)
where
receipt
of
a
firearm
is
a
use
under
the
statute.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
one
could
make
the
argument,
your
honor,
as
i
said,
that
making
material
statement.
i'm
saying
the
court
in
smith--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
because...
and
that's
why
the
government
is
drawing
the
line
today
at
actual
receipt,
and
that's...
that's
all
that's
involved
in
this
case.
the
actual
taking
of
the
firearm
where
then
you
have
all
the
dangers
present
with
which
congress
was
concerned,
which
is--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
there
are
two
points
in
response
to
that,
your
honor.
one
is
that
if
the
buyer
of
drugs
buys
the
distribution
quantity,
then
we
do
often
treat
the
buyer
as
a
distributor
under
the
distribution
statute.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
when
congress...
no
that's
correct,
your
honor;
but
in
those
cases
where
congress
uses
words,
like
it
does
in
the
distribution
statute,
that
clearly
targets
one
side
or
other
of
the
transaction.
but
here
what
the
court
is
interpreting
is
the
much
broader
word,
924(d)'s
forfeiture
provisions
that
congress
employed
the
word
use
broadly
in
section
924(d)
and
used
it
to
include
receipt
crimes;
and
smith
cites
several
examples
of
receipt
crimes
that
smith
believed
was
a
use,
including
unlicensed
receipt
of
a
firearm
from
out
of
state,
receipt
of
a
stolen
firearm
and
receipt
of
a
firearm
with
an
intent
to
commit
a
felony;
and
in
context
congress
clearly
did
use
924(d).
if...
if
in
response
to
their
argument
in
ponce,
their
argument
about
(d)(1),
the
forfeiture
provisions
in
(d)(1)
and
d
3,
i
do
think
those
provisions
strongly
support
the
government's
argument
here.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
because
our
reading,
justice
scalia,
gives
full
effect
to
the
provisions
that
congress
has
carefully
chosen
to
place
in
(d)(3)
and
the
petitioner's
reading
does
not.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
and
if
i
could
explain
it.
in
(d)(1)...
it's
on
page
8a
of
our
brief,
(d)(1)...
in
924(d)(1)
congress
provided
two
principal
ways
in
which
the
government
can
forfeit
firearms.
the
first
is
if
an
offense
is
completed,
the
government
can
forfeit
a
firearm
that
is
involved
in
or
used
in
that
offense.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes
it
does,
your
honor;
but
that
actually
strengthens
my
point.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well
yes,
your
honor,
but
if
you
allow
me
to
continue
on,
further
on
in
(d)(1)
congress
used
a
narrow
subset
of
crimes
some
of
which
include
receipt
crimes
where
it
only
used
the
word
use
and
that's
the
logic
to
this
court's
decision
in
smith
and
it
applies
equally
here.
further
down
in
(d)(1)
congress
allowed
the
government
to
forfeit
firearms
intended
to
be
used
in
certain
very
specific
listed
crimes,
and
in
other
words
to
forfeit
the
firearms
before
the...
the
crime
actually
is
committed.
some
of
those
crimes
include...
receipt
crimes...
include
the
very
receipt
crimes
listed
by
this
court
in
smith'
and
so
given
that
congress
believed
that
the
firearms
intended
to
be
used
in
purely
receipt
crimes
were
ultimately
going
to
be
used
by
the
receipt,
congress
employed
the
term
here
very
broadly
including
to
receipt
of
a
firearm.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
if
you
were
to
interpret
(d)(3)
in
that
way,
your
honor,
you
would
do
great
violence
to
what
congress
intended.
if
i
can
point
you
to
page
10-a
of
our
brief
in...
it's
(d)(3)
that
sets
forth
very
particularly
the
crimes
that
congress
thought
the
government
should
be
able
to
forfeit
firearms
before
the
crime
occurs.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
it's
on
the
government's
gray
brief,
10-a.
in
(e)
of
922...
this
is
924.
i'm
sorry,
924(d)(3)(e
).
it
includes
any
offense
described
in
section...
and
it
lists
several
examples
including
922(n).
and
922(n)
is
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
2-a,
which
makes
it
a
crime
for
someone
under
felony
indictment
to
ship,
transport,
or
receive
a
firearm.
now,
under
petitioner's
reading
they
would
say:
well,
that's
fine.
that
still
has
meaning.
under
our
reading
of
"use",
the
government
can
forfeit
firearms
that
the
person
under
felony
indictment
intends
to
ship
or
transport,
but
cannot
forfeit
firearms
that
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
don't
think
that
it's...
several
responses,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it's
unnatural
to
use
"use"
to
mean
"receipt"
when
you're
talking
about
using
something
as
a
medium
of
exchange
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime.
because,
as
i
said
before,
company
stores
use
script.
american
stores
use
dollars.
french
stores
use
euros.
we
can
use
the
word
"use"
and
then
have
to
wait--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--no,
your
honor.
i
disagree.
i
think
when
a
company
store
uses
script,
that
means
it
accepts
script
as
money
from
the
company
employees.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
that
far
here,
your
honor,
because
the
"use"
here
is
use
as
a
medium
of
exchange.
so
the
court
need
go
no
further.
and
that's
another
response
to
justice
breyer.
the
court
need
go
no
further
than
it
did
in
smith,
which
you...
it
doesn't
have
to...
we
have
much
more
than
receipt
simpliciter
here,
justice
breyer.
we
have
the
negotiated
transaction
where
he
received
the
firearms
as
the
medium
of
exchange.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor,
if
you
take
it
as
the
medium
of
exchange
to
sell
your
drugs.
he
doesn't
dispute
that
he
engaged
in
a
drug
trafficking
crime,
and
he
doesn't
dispute
that
he
took
the
gun
as
the
currency
to
close
that
drug
deal,
and
that
is
a
use
within
the
meaning...
within
a
natural
meaning
of
"use",
if
it
is
used
as
currency.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
in
any
bartering
exchange,
justice
kennedy--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--any
person--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
imagine...
imagine
a
statute
that
made
it
a
crime
to
use
united
states
currency
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime.
a
drug
dealer
who
sold
his
drugs
for
cash
would
surely
be
in
violation
of
that
statute.
this
is
no
different.
the
court
has
already
held
that
using
the
firearm
as
currency
is
a
violation
of
the
statute.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
i
think
they
are
using
it
as
the
medium
of
exchange,
which
i
think
even
under
the
sentence
rationale
in
smith...
such
as...
such
as
statutes,
if
you
would
say:
well,
what's
the
normally
intended
use
of
united
states
currency?
and
that
would
be
as
the
medium
of
exchange,
and
both
parties
would
be--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
but
the
court
has
already
held
that
using
a
gun
as
the
medium
of
exchange
falls
within
the
statute.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
the
rationale
necessary
to
the
holding
in
smith,
your
honor,
was
that
use
of
a
gun
as
an
item
of
trade
or
commerce,
specifically
as
the
medium
of
exchange,
is
the
"use".
and,
in
fact,
smith
refers
several
times
to
an
earlier
d.c.
circuit
decision
in
harris,
a
per
curiam,
a
public
per
curiam,
in
which
two
members
of
this
court
were
on
the
panel,
that
involved
this
very
fact
pattern,
where
the...
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
in...
in
bailey,
your
honor,
the
court
required
a
use
that
makes
the
gun
an
operative
factor,
a
use
that
changes
the
circumstances
where
both
parties
are
aware
the
gun
is
being
used.
this
is
a
far
cry
from
bailey.
this
is
not
locked-up
weapons
where
only
one
party
is
aware
of
their
existence
to
protect
the
store
of
drugs.
this
gun
was
front
and
center,
part
and
parcel,
of
the
drug
transaction.
it
was--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
government's
position.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
do
not
know
the
specific
circumstances
of
the
charging
decision
here,
justice
ginsburg,
but
in
the
fifth
circuit
the
law
was
already
clear
that
this
was
a
use.
and,
indeed,
when
congress
amended
the
statute
post
bailey
to
expand
this
court's
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
"use",
there
was
no
need
to
address
this
particular
fact
pattern
because
most
of
the
circuits
had
been--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
either
of
those
questions,
but
i
do
know
that
we
argued
in
our
opposition
to
the
cert
petition
that
this
question
doesn't
have
much
going-forward
significance
because
of
that
new
amendment.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
it's
part
and
parcel--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
the
petitioner
agreed
with
you
on
that,
your
honor,
but
four
circuits
have
agreed
with
the
government.
on
the
going-forward
basis,
we
think
we
do
have
a
good
argument.
here,
and
in
your
hypothetical,
imagine
the
situation
where
the
gun
is
turned
over
first,
and
then
the
payment...
and
then
the
drugs
are
traded.
it
would
certainly
seem
that
you
possessed
it
in
furtherance
there.
i
think
it
is
possession
in
furtherance
in...
in...
because
it
is
the
sine
qua
non
of
drug
transactions.
it's
the
very
part
and
parcel
of
drug
transactions.
but
it
does...
this
case
does
matter
to
the
government
because
the
government
has
prosecuted
peeople
properly,
it
thinks,
under
the
"use"
prong
of
the
statute.
those
people
are...
currently
stand
convicted;
and,
as
experience
proves
post-bailey,
if
this
court
were
to
rule
against
the
government
here,
that
could
have
an
effect
on
those
people's
current
incarceration.
if
i
could
get
back
to
my
922(d)
point,
just
to
finish
up,
which
is
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--no,
your
honor.
of
course
if
the
court
feels
that
these
people
are
properly
convicted,
then,
you
know,
they
can
pursue
whatever
remedies
they
may
have.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
it...
that
it
is
of
ongoing
importance
to
the
government,
even
though
as
a
prospective
matter
the
government
may
be
able
to
charge
this
conduct
under
possession
and
furtherance.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
right,
your
honor.
from
now
on,
the
government
could
charge,
if
you
rule
against
us
in
this
case,
we
believe
we
can
charge
this
conduct
under
possession
and
furtherance.
however,
my
point
is...
is
that
we
nevertheless
care
about
the
result
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
people
in
this
situation
have
used
a
firearm
as
a
medium
of
exchange
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime
and
stand
properly
convicted.
it
was
only
to
make
the
point
that
the
government
does
have
an
interest
in
how
the
court
rules
in
this
case
and
that
it's
not
meaningless
to
us
which
prong
applies
here.
back
to
the
922(d)(4)
point,
the...
under
petitioner's
reading,
it
would
mean
that
the
government
can't
forfeit
firearms
in
a
situation
like
someone
under
felony
indictment
ships
or
transports...
intends
to
ship
or
transform
a
firearm.
under
petitioner's
reading
the
government
can
forfeit
that
because
they
consider
that
to
be
active
verbs,
but
under...
if
the
person
under
felony
indictment
simply
intends
to
receive
a
firearm,
the
government
would
have
to
wait
until
that
person
receives
the
firearm
in
order
to
be
able
to
forfeit
it,
and
that
is...
i
suggest
that
no
rational
congress
would
have
meant
that
by
referring
to
the
provision.
they
do
point
to...
well,
if
there...
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
government
believes
that
this
crime,
this...
that
the
use
of
the
gun
in
this
manner
is
a
crime,
that
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
wanted
the
defendant
in
smith
to
stand
convicted
of
this
crime
but
to
leave
the
drug
dealer
who
ends
up
with
the
gun
not
with
the
punishment
for
this
crime.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
whose
trunk
is
it
in,
your
honor?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
he
has
constructive
possession
of
it,
justice
stevens,
and
he's...
i
believe
he
would
have
received
it
and
that
would
be
sufficient.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but...
i
mean
bailey
makes
examples
to
things
that
would
involve
an
active
employment
including
reference
to
a
gun
that...
if
the
reference
to
a
gun
changes
the
circumstances
of
the
underlying
offense.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
and
if
the
court
wanted
to
limit
it
to
"use"
means
that
you've
actually
taken
possession
of
it
because
that...
that's
all
the
government
is
defending
here.
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
that's
what
happens
in
most
of
the
cases.
i...
i
would
also
like
to
say
in
response
to
their
point
about
the
government
sting,
that
if
you
look
at
the
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
there
are
many
cases
where...
that
indicate
these
kinds
of
trades
do
happen
in
the
real
world
absent
government
involvement.
for
example,
in
the
first
circuit's
decision
in
cotto,
which
is
currently
pending
before
the
court,
the...
the
person
who
ultimately
came...
became
the
confidential
informant...
before
that
the
drug
deal
her
sold
to
her
drugs
for
guns
on
20
separate
occasions.
so
this
does
go
on--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--we...
we
believe--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--there
is
no
attempt
offense
under
section
924(c),
justice
breyer.
you
can
use
a
gun
during
and
in
relation
to
an
attempted
drug
crime,
but
you
can't
attempt
to
use
a
gun.
the...
the
government
believes
it
could,
on
a
going-forward
basis,
charge
possession...
oh,
you're
asking
me
about
whether
we
could
charge
aiding
and
abetting
going
forward.
the...
the
seventh
ccircuit
has
suggested
in
dick
that
that
would
be
open
to
the
government
to
charge.
i
think
that...
and
potentially,
even
though
it
wasn't
in
the
indictment
here,
it
could
be
read
into
the
indictment.
but
there
are
two
possible
issues:
one
that
my
colleague
has
pointed
out,
which
is
in
some
cases
where
congress
has
criminalized
one
side
of
the
transaction
but
not
the
other.
and
so
that
might
be
the
situation
here.
the
court--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
there
are
six
circuits
on
our
side
of
the
conflict
and...
so
it...
it...
i
don't
know.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
