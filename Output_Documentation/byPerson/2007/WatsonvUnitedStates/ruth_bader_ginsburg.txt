justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
address
first
whether
receipt
of
the
gun
constitutes
possession
of
the
gun?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
under
the
statute
as
amended,
possession
is
also
indictable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
smith,
the
court
said
that
the
reason
that
selling
the
gun
in
exchange
for
drugs...
what
was
dangerous
about
that
was
the
potential
for
instantly
converting
the
gun
from
currency
to
a
cannon.
but
here
isn't
that
even
all
the
more
of
concern
because
one
who
receives
the
gun
can
instantly
turn
it
around
and
shoot
the
drug
seller?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
the
same
on
both
sides.
it
seems
to
me
in
both
cases
there
is
a
risk
of
using
the
gun.
the
one
who
comes
in
with
the
gun
can
use
it;
the
one
who
receives
the
gun
can
use
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
koch,
but
the
government
answers
that,
a
dollar
for
coffee,
by
saying
it
depends
what
question
you
ask.
so
if
you
ask
was
the
coffee
part
of
a
beverage
transaction,
the
answer
would
be
of
course
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
gun
transaction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
remember
whether
you
ask
in
your
brief
as
an
alternative
argument
for
the
overruling
of
smith.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
to
be
used
by
somebody,
some
human,
and
the
human
in
this
case
is
mr.
watson.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
answer
to
my
question,
you
said
you
were
not
urging
the
overruling
of
smith?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
has
a
gun
in
his
hand
he
is
certainly
carrying
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was...
watson
possessed
the
gun,
would
you
agree
with
that,
in
furtherance
of
the
transaction?
would
you
say
that
this
case
fits
the
statute,
as
amended,
so
it
could
have
been
charged
as
possession?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
was
it...
why
wasn't
possession
charged
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
prosecution
would
certainly
want
to
assure
the
success
of
the
argument;
and
if
this
is
clearly
possession,
why
wasn't
possession
charged?
and
does
the
department
of
justice
give
any
guidance
to
prosecutors
since
the
1988
amendment
on
what
to
charge
in
these
situations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
smith,
in
smith,
justice
o'connor
used
the
illustration
turning
currency
into
a
cannon.
you
can't
do
that
very
well
if
the
gun
is
in
a
car,
in
a
locked
trunk
in
a
car
on
the
street.
you
can't
turn
the
currency,
the
gun,
into
a
cannon.
