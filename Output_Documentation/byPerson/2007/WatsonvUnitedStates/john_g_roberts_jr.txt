chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-571,
watson
v.
united
states.
mr.
koch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
have
the
same
question
as
justice
ginsburg.
it
seems
to
me,
absent
some
precedents
which
narrows
this
definition,
that
that
would
have
been
the
way
to
charge
your
client.
that's
not
what
was
charged;
that's
not
the
indictment;
that's
not
what
you're
arguing.
so
i
guess
the
question
is
more
appropriate
for
the
government.
but,
if,
following
justice
ginsburg's
question,
this
covers
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does,
then
we're
not
arguing
about
very
much.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
koch,
let's
say
that
the
parties
to
the
transaction
are
concerned
about
avoiding
exposure
under
the
money-laundering
statute,
and
so
they
got
together
and
said:
all
right,
we
are
going
to
have
this
deal.
what
can
we
use
besides
money?
and
they
say:
well,
let's
use
guns,
or
let's
use
a
gun.
and
the
seller
of
the
drugs
says:
okay.
i'm
willing
to
use
that.
isn't
he
using
the
gun
in
furtherance
of
the
transaction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
being
actively
employed
as
the
consideration
in
the
sale.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
being
shot,
but
it's
still
being
employed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
natural,
grammatical
construction
to
say
he's
willing
to
use
the
gun
for
the
consideration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
subsection
(b)
is
not
charged
in
the
indictment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
but
that
was
not
charged
in
the
indictment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
section
2(b)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
koch.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
have...
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
say...
let's
say
you
have
a
duel,
and
each
person
in
the
duel
needs
to
have
a
weapon.
one
person
has
a
gun;
the
other
person
has
the
sword.
would
you
say
the
person
with
the
sword
is
using
the
gun
in
the
duel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
you
can't
have
a
duel
without
both
people
having
weapons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
person--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--each
person
in
the
drug
exchange
brings
to
the
table
what
they've
got.
the
one
has
the
drugs;
the
other
brings
the
gun.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
person
with
the
drugs
is
using
the
gun.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
cuts
the
other
way.
congress
knows
how
to
say
involved
in
if
it
wants
to
reach
that
broadly,
and
it
didn't
do
it
under
the
provision
in
which...
pursuant
to
which
mr.
watson
was
indicted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
congress
passes
a
statute
saying
anyone
who
uses
a
gun
in
a
crime
of
violence
gets
an
additional
sentence,
the
person
who
is
shot
is
using
the
gun
in
a
crime
of
violence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
that
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense:
that
the
transaction
be
negotiated
in
advance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think...
i
don't
see
how
your
hypothetical
advances
the
argument.
i
mean,
i
don't
necessarily
agree
that
someone
who
sells
drugs
for
currency
is
using
the
currency
in
the
transaction.
they
are
accepting
it.
it
is
what
they
want.
that's
not
the
same
as
using
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
what
weakens
your
hypothetical.
it's
not
the
normal
use
of
a
gun
as
a
medium
of
exchange.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
held
that
the
person
who
does
use
the
gun,
which
is
the
natural,
grammatical
construction,
uses
the
firearm.
that's
quite
a
bit
different
than
the
question
of
whether
someone
who
receives
it
as
the
consideration
is
using
the
firearm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
just...
i
don't
understand
the
significance
of
the
argument
you
just
made.
are
you
saying
that
because
some
people
might
be
let
out
of
prison
if
we
correctly
construed
the
statute,
we
should
read
it
your
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
was
your
point
referring
to
the
people
who
were
convicted
under
this
statute...
under
this
construction
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
argument
you
made
earlier
was
that
this
may
not
be
of
particular
ongoing
significance
because
of
the
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
maynard.
mr.
koch,
you
have
4
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
koch.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
in
case
06-571,
watson
versus
united
states,
which
he
asked
me
to
announce.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner,
michael
a.
watson
traded
narcotics
for
a
pistol
and
was
indicted
for
using
a
pistol
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
section
924(c)(1)(a).
he
pleaded
guilty,
but
reserved
the
right
to
appeal
on
the
ground
that
receiving
a
firearm
in
exchange
for
narcotics
is
not
use
of
a
firearm
within
the
meaning
of
section
924
(c)(1)(a).
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
argument.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
hold
that
watson's
conduct
does
not
constitute
use
of
a
firearm,
we
reverse.
we
have
construed
the
same
provision
twice
before.
both
times,
we
relied
primarily
on
the
ordinary
or
natural
meaning
of
the
verb
"in
context".
this
appeal
to
ordinary
english
leaves
the
government
without
much
of
a
case
for
--
for
in
regular
speech,
we
would
not
say
that
watson
used
a
firearm
by
merely
receiving
it
in
a
barter
transaction.
the
government's
two
main
arguments
for
trumping
ordinary
english
are
unavailing.
first,
the
government
argues
that
under
a
neighboring
provision,
section
924(d)(1),
the
verb
used
is
employed
in
a
manner
that
includes
receipt
in
barter.
it
asks
us
to
import
this
meaning
into
section
(c)(1)(a),
but
this
argument
over
reads
our
precedence
and
forgets
that
in
the
two
different
subsections,
the
common
verb
speaks
to
different
issues
in
different
voices
and
at
different
levels
of
specificity.
second,
the
government
warns
that
a
decision
in
favor
of
watson
would
create
unacceptable
asymmetry
with
smith
versus
united
states,
a
prior
case
in
which
we
held
that
trading
of
firearm
for
narcotics
does
constitute
use
of
the
firearm.
whatever
the
tension
between
the
--
that
result
in
the
outcome
here,
law
depends
on
respect
for
language
and
would
be
served
better
by
statutory
amendment
if
congress
sees
asymmetry,
then
by
racking
statutory
language
to
cover
a
policy
it
fails
to
fit.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
