justice
stephen
g.

what
do
you
have
besides
the
linguistic
argument?
i
mean,
when
i
start
out,
i
can't
think
of
a
reason
why
congress
wouldn't
want
to
penalize
the
buyer,
not
the
seller.
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute
that
does
catch
your
client,
if
they
had
only
charged
him
with
the
right
part.
but
no
one
in
his
right
mind
would
ever
rely
on
a
ruling
in
your
favor
to
actually
engage
in
such
a
transaction,
since
it
would
violate
the
statute
in
15
different
ways.
i
exaggerate,
but
you
see
the
point.
so
you
have
a
linguistic
argument
which
people
are...
you're
right,
i
think,
in
saying
it's
awkward
but
not
impossible.
and,
therefore,
awkward
but
not
impossible;
we
create
an
anomaly
in
the
law.
i
can't
think
of
a
reason
why
to
do
it.
so
what
else
do
you
have?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
sometimes
we
try
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
want
to
put
you
in
a
whipsaw
here.
[laughter]
sometimes
policy
seems
relevant,
too,
to
figure
out
what
congress
wanted.
but
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
i
had,
which
is
do
you
want
to
us
overturn
smith?
are
you
asking
that,
because
i
could
understand
it
more
easily
if
you
said,
look,
both
sides
of
the
transaction
should
be
treated
alike,
but
they
should
be
both
outside
the
word
"use".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
receives
the
gun
and
it
could
have
been
loaded.
and
if
it
was
loaded,
you
receive
a
loaded
gun,
and
you're
there
and
you
give
the
money
for
the
gun
and
you
have
the
gun
and
somebody
comes
up,
maybe
you'll
shoot
him.
i
mean,
that
seems
like
a
risk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
bailey
involved
a
guy,
he
had
the
gun
in
a
locked
thing
in
the
trunk
of
his
car,
which
is
a
little
different
from
holding
it
in
your
hand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
what...
this
is
what
is
bothering
me
about
your
side
of
this
case.
i
start
thinking
this
is
a
total
fluke.
normally,
you
would
charge
him
under
"possession
in
furtherance
of",
which
you
didn't
for
reasons
i
don't
know.
or
he
would
be
an
accessory,
which
he
isn't
here
because
the
other
side
was
a
government
agent.
so
we've
got
a
fluke.
now,
if
i
accept
your
linguistic
approach,
i
don't
know
what
i'm
getting
into.
imagine
an
artillery
team.
one
loads
the
ammunition;
the
other
pulls
the
trigger.
we
say
the
team
used
the
ammunition,
but
the
guy
who
pulled
the
trigger
by
himself
didn't.
think
of
a
baseball
team.
the
pitcher
doesn't
use
the
bat,
but
the
team
does.
now,
if
i
take
your
linguistic
approach,
where
am
i
in
respect
to
other
statutes?
but
if
i
deny
your
linguistic
approach
on
the
ground
that
it's
unnatural
to
say
"use"
of
the...
the
individual
used
it,
all
i've
done
is
create
a
fluke
case
because
it
will
never
come
up
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
those
are
all
examples
that
i
used
the
gun
to
pay
for
the
item.
you
don't
use
the
word
"use"
when
you're
the
seller.
it
doesn't
fit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
is
there
any
reason
in
such
a
case,
if
you
lost
this
case,
in
the
future
could
you
not
just
charge,
as
justice
alito
said,
that
they're
a
principal
in
the
possession
by
the
seller?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
government
is
not
involved?
and
if
the
government's
involved
on
the
other
side,
i
guess
you'd
have
to
charge
an
attempt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
your...
your
practical
argument
then
is
that
there
has
been
considerable
reliance
on
your
interpretation
to
the
extent
that
many
people
have
been
convicted
under
it.
how
many?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
about?
have
any
rough
idea?
