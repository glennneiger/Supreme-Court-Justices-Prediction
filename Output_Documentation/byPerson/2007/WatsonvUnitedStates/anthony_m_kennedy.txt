but...
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
all
watson
did
was
to
receive
the
gun.
but
he
agreed
to
accept
the
gun
as
payment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
sense
he
used
a
gun.
it
wasn't
his
gun
yet,
but
he
agreed
that
if
the
gun
would
be
brought
to
the
scene
of
the
transaction,
that
he
would
accept
receipt
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
says,
you
get
a
gun,
you
put
it
in
your
car,
you
come
to
my
house,
you
bring
that
gun
with
you,
and
i
will
give
you
drugs.
i
think
in
a
sense
he's
using
the
gun.
it's
through
the,
the
actions
of
another
that
he
is
doing
it
to
be
sure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps.
but
it
seems
to
me
to
unduly
constrict
the
case
to
say
that
all
he
did
was
receive
it.
he
did
more
than
that.
he
agreed
in
advance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
he
received
the
gun,
loaded
it
and
said,
well,
now,
let's
renegotiate
this
transaction?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
he
doesn't
brandish
it.
he
just,
he
puts
it
in
his
pocket
and
he
says:
let's
renegotiate
this.
what
result?
could
the
government
charge
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
you
could
say
we
used
the
gun
in
order
to
complete
the
drug
transaction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
the
parties
are
viewed
collectively
so
that
in
justice
breyer's
example
the
pitcher
and
the
batter
used
a
ball
and
a
bat.
is
that
your
position?
and
in
this
case
the
seller
and
the
buyer
used
drugs
and
a
gun.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
that
fit
with
the
words
of
the
statute,
any
person
who--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--even
though
it's
a
collective
enterprise,
you
can
still
focus
on
one
of
the
parties
and
prevail.
is
that
your
position?
