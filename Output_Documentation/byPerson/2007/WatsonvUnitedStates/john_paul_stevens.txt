justice
john
paul
stevens
he
agreed
to
let
the
other
party
to
the
transaction
use
a
gun
to
pay
for
the
drugs,
the
other
party
to
make
the
use
of
the
gun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
on
the
other
side
of
the
transaction,
it's
perfectly
natural
to
say
i
used
the
gun
for
the
transaction.
what
is
the
converse
sentence?
i
used
the
gun--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
didn't
use
the
gun
as
a
medium
of
exchange.
i
accepted
the
gun
as
a
medium
of
exchange.
he
didn't
use
it
until
he
got
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
have
the
simple
sentence.
i
used
the
gun
to
pay
for
the
drugs...
that's
easy,
but
you
don't
have
a
simple
countervailing
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
but
justice
breyer
made
the
very
persuasive
argument
that
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
treat
both
sides
of
the
transaction
exactly
the
same;
but
isn't
it
the
fact
that
in
many
drug
transactions
the
buyer
is
not
treated
the
same
way
as
the
seller?
it's
a
crime
to
sell
poison
drugs
but
it
may
not
be
a
crime
to
buy
the
poison
drugs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
generally
speaking
buyers
and
sellers
are
not
always
treated
alike
in
the
criminal
law,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
argument
in
justice
o'connor's
opinion
was
largely
linguistic.
the
natural
use
of
the
word
"use"
is
to
say:
i
used
it
to
pay
for
the
gun...
i
used
it
to
pay
for
the
drugs,
rather.
but
you
don't
have
a
countervailing
sentence
that
fits
into
anything
in
her
opinion,
and
you
haven't
really
answered
his
reliance
on
the...
on
the
other
case,
which
requires
active
use.
justice
john
paul
stevens
something
just
occurred
to
me.
when
you
distinguish
the
case,
our
unanimous
opinion
requiring
active
use,
you
said,
well,
that...
that
gun
was
in
the
trunk
of
a
car
so...
what
if
this
gun
had
been
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
also
and
the
guy
said,
well,
it's
now...
that's
your
gun?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
just
transferred
ownership
in
exchange
for
drugs
with...
by
transferring
title
to
a
gun
that
was
located
in
the...
in
the
trunk
of
a
car.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it...
it
was
not
sufficient
in...
in
bailey
in
any
case,
but
it
would
be
sufficient
here
because
it
played
a
role
in
the
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
