justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it...
why
isn't
your
argument
more
directly
that
the
issue
here
is...
is
nonweapon
use
by
a
versus
nonweapon
use
by
b?
you
represent
b
and
you
say
b
wasn't
the
one
who
used
it
in
a
nonweapon
sense?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
you
are
right,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
not...
as
you
said
before,
you're
not
arguing
for
the
overruling
of
smith,
and
therefore,
you
concede
that
the
other
party
to
the
transaction
used
the
gun.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
a
nonweapon
sense.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
really
not
a
bad
one.
i
mean,
you
don't...--
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
does
not
answer
the
question
use
by
whom.
as
i
understand
it,
we
are
not
really
arguing
about
whether
the
gun
was
used
in
the
transaction;
we
are
arguing
about
whether
the
defendant
was
the
one
who
used
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
mean,
the
problem
you,
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
that
you
can't
totally
paper
over
is
that
that's
not
usually
the
way
we
talk.
i
mean,
if
i
buy
a
car,
and
pay
money
for
it,
i
do
not
use
the
car
in
the
transaction.
it's
what
i
have
after
the
transaction
is
complete;
and
you,
you
got
that
kind
of
linguistic
problem
here,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
adds
an
additional
element
you
have
to
prove
but
it
doesn't
answer
the
linguistic
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
only
way
you
can
make
that
argument
is
to
define
the
crime
as
consisting
of
the
agreement
as
opposed
to
the
consummated
transaction.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
he
was
using
it
because
he
agreed
to
accept
it.
