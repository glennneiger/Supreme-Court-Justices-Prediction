mr.
karl
j.
koch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
watson's
receipt
of
a
firearm
in
exchange
for
drugs
does
not
constitute
the
use
of
that
firearm
as
the
word
18
u.s.c.
section
924(c)(1)
for
two
principal
reasons.
first,
applying
the
plain
and
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
"use",
the
receipt
of
a
thing
is
not
the
use
of
that
thing.
there
is
no
grammatically
proper
way
to
say
that
someone
uses
a
firearm
when
all
that
person
does
is
receive
it.
second,
treating
receipt
as
use
under
the
statute
conflicts
with
this
court's
decision
in
bailey
v.
united
states,
which
held
that
use
requires
active
employment.
and
i'll
address
those
two
points
in
turn.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
yes,
ma'am.
i
believe
receipt
does
constitute
possession.
however,
of
course,
possession
standing
alone
under
this
court's
decision
in
bailey
does
not
constitute
use.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
possession
in
furtherance
of
the
offense
is...
is...
would
be
indictable.
that...
that
was
not
charged
in
this
particular
case.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the...
that
the
circumstances
of
this
case
might
not
call
that
into...
into
play
simply
because
his
possession
really
was...
was
incidental,
and
it
was
following
the
conclusion
of
the
drug
transaction.
so
i
think...
i
question
whether
the
possession
in
furtherance
would
necessarily
apply
here.
of
course,
it
was
not
charged.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
understand,
your
honor.
my
only
point,
again,
would
be,
that
recognizing
that
"in
furtherance",
at
least
by
the
authors
of
that
language,
would
suggest
it
to
mean
something
more
than
"in
relation
to,
".
i
think
the
question
could
legitimately
be
asked
in
a...
in
a
transaction
like
this,
where
the
possession
basically
is
what
he
was
attempting
to
achieve
and
did,
in
fact,
achieve,
but
after
the...
at
the
end
transaction.
i
don't...
i
can't
answer
whether
or
not,
ultimately,
that
would
be...
deemed
to
be
in
furtherance
or
not.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
don't
believe
that
the...
that,
given
what
the...
what
this
court
has
said
in
bailey,
that
that
would
constitute
active
employment
still.
the--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--however,
the...
from
the
standpoint--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--yes,
sir.
from
the
standpoint
of
the...
of
the
seller...
from
the
standpoint
of
the
drug
seller,
who's
ultimately
still
doing
nothing
more
with
respect
to
the
gun,
i
think
the
focus
has
to
be
on
what
are
his
activities?
he
hasn't
even
come
into
possession
of
it
in
the
example
that
your
honor
has
given.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
that
we
would...
that
we...
that
it
could
be
held
in
the
absence
even
there
of
even
possession...
whether
or
not
that
would
be
enough
to
constitute
the
use.
that
would
be
the
first
question
that
would
occur
to
me.
the...
certainly
grammatically,
and
dealing,
of
course,
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
grammatically
the
question
on
the
table
is:
when
interpreting
18
u.s.c.
section
924(c)(1)
giving
it,
as
this
court
held
in
smith,
its
plain
and
ordinary
meaning,
the
example
that
was
used
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
united
states
v.
stewart,
i
thought,
was
appropriate,
where...
the
coffee
shop
example,
where
you
have
the...
the
individual
buying
the
coffee,
and
you
have
the
cashier.
the...
the
customer
doesn't...
the
customer
comes
in
and
pays
with
the
dollar.
the
cashier
accepts
the
dollar,
but
the
cafeteria
isn't
using
the
dollar
by
receiving
it
as
payment.
it's
just
receiving
it.
likewise,
the
customer
isn't
using
the
coffee
through
the
act
of
receiving
it.
he's
getting
it.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
do
think
that
there
are
distinctions
between
the
two
conducts,
sir.
first
of
all,
certainly
the
person
that...
that
has
the
gun
and
is
bringing
it
into
that
transaction
i
would
suggest,
as
a
practical
matter
presents
a
different
type
of
risk.
he's
got
the
gun.
he's
in
control
of
it.
he's
going
to
decide
when
and
if
to
hand
it
over
and
in
what
condition
it
would
be
when
he
hands
it
over,
or
not
to
hand
it
over
at
all.
so
that
the--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--i
think--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--well,
assuming
of
course
it
would...
in
smith
the
court
held
that
that
is
a
use
within
the
term
of
the
statute.
i
think
that
the...
looking
at...
this
does
not
do
violence
to
this
court's
decision
in
bailey.
there
still
has
to
be
some
active
employment.
the
person
on
the
drug
end
of
the
transaction
is...
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
gun,
doesn't
even
possess
the
gun,
which...
before
the
other
party
decides
to
hand
it
over.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
he
could
if
the
gun
was
handed
over
in
a
condition...
first
of
all,
there...
were
there
bullets
or
not?
that's
going
to
be
up
to,
at
the
first
instance,
whether
he
brings
them
or
not,
the
gun
seller.
the
gun
seller
can
decide
whether
to
hand
it
over--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--i
will...
i
will
grant
your
honor
there's
obviously
risk
presented
by
the
presence
of
the
gun
potentially
by
either
party.
i
would
suggest
that,
as
between
the
two
parties,
the
fellow
that
shows
up
with
the
gun
who's
going
to
decide
when
and
if
to
hand
it
over
and
in
what
condition,
cocked,
uncocked,
loaded
or
unloaded,
et
cetera,
is
in
somewhat
more
control.
all
that
being
said,
one
still
gets
back
to
the
central
point,
which
is,
regardless
of
congress's
purpose
or
desires
here,
they
still
chose
words
that
had
fairly
common
meanings,
in
this
case
"use".
and
very...
it's
grammatically
impossible,
i'd
suggest,
in
the
straightforward
transaction
and
trade
situation
to
suggest
that
the
guy
that's
receiving
the
gun
is
using
it
by
receiving
it,
any
more
than
the
cashier
is
using
the
dollar
that
i
pay
for
the
cup
of
coffee
with.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
do
think
that
there...
that's
an
issue
that's
been
raised.
i...
i
question
whether,
when
the
underlying
offense
itself
is
the
transaction
and
these
are
the
only
two
parties,
whether
or
not
aiding
and
abetting
liability
would
be
intended
to
extend
that
far,
any
more
than
it
would
be,
for
example,
to
a
drug
purchaser
being
charged
with
aiding
and
abetting
the
distribution
of
drugs.
certainly,
given
the
severe
penalties
involved,
i...
i'm
a
little
uncomfortable
with
that
being
a
usage
of
that
statute
or
usage
of
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute.
i
also
would
point
out
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
these
cases
do
involve
police
informants,
practically
all
of
them.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
that
is
what
that
statute
says,
sir.
there
is
some
jurisprudence,
and
i'm...
it
may
be
older
in
nature...
that
deals
with
two
parties
to
a
transaction
and
whether
or
not
aiding
and
abetting
liability
can
be
used,
again
going
back
to
my
drug
purchaser
situation.
and
i
question
whether
or
not
the...
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
can
be
used.
it
would
basically,
in
the
drug
context,
read
out
the
possession
statute.
every
drug
buyer
could
be
charged
with
distribution
as
a
principal
under
section
2.
the...
again,
of
course
that's
not
charged
here,
and
i've
not...
i've
not
seen
cases
where
that
has
been
charged.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
18
u.s.c.
section
2
was
what
i
understood
the
question
to
be,
judge.
i
apologize.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
no,
sir.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
it
was
not.
now,
the...
the
government's
brief
concedes
it
would
not
be
natural
to
say
that
the
customer
in
my
example
with
the
coffee
used
the
coffee.
unless
we're
prepared
to
discard
that
standard
usage
of
words
and
sacrifice
it
for
the
purpose
that
we
believe
congress
intended,
then
i
think
that
the
analysis
really
does
stop
there
if
one's
reading
the
language
of
the
statute
and
applying
it.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
one
of
the
problems--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--yes,
ma'am.
one
of
the
problems
i
think
that
that
raises
that
i
see
in
different
contexts
with
this
is
the
different
ways
that
the
word
"use"
is
used
in
an
active
or
passive
context.
one
might
see
two
people
to
that
transaction
and
ask,
is
a
dollar
being
used
in
that
transaction?
and
i
think
that
we
would
all
fairly
say
yes.
but
the
focus
in
924(c)
is
on
that
defendant:
did
he
use
it?
just
in
the
coffee
shop
example,
did
the
cashier
use
the
dollar?
or
in
my
example,
did
mr.
watson
use
the
firearm?
and
i
think
that
that's...
that's
the
question
that
needs
to
be
asked
and
when
that
question
is
asked
in
that
format,
then
the
answer
i
suggest
is
no.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
did
not
raise
that
in
the
briefs,
no,
ma'am.
with
regards
to
bailey,
which
i
think
answers
to
a
great
extent
some
of
the
questions
presented
here,
bailey
of
course
held
that
924(c)(1)
requires
evidence
sufficient
to
show
an
active
employment
of
the
firearm
by
the
defendant.
mr.
watson
here
did
not
actively
employ
the
firearm.
bailey
narrowed
the
category
of
uses
that
fell
within
the
statute.
to
quote
bailey,
it
said
"it's
undeniable
the
active
employment
reading
of
use
restricts
the
scope
of
924(c)(1).
"
that's
the
jewel
of
that
case.
bailey
held
that
use
requires
active
employment,
not
only
in
general
but
by
the
defendant.
more
importantly
perhaps
to
this
case,
bailey
held
that
possession
alone
is
not
use,
and
here
mr.
watson
was
trying
to
achieve
possession,
but...
and
ultimately
when
he
did
get
possession,
he
had
it
instantaneously.
so
looking
at
it
from
a
temporal
standpoint,
first
he
receives
the
gun.
before
that
point
he
doesn't
have
possession,
so
he
doesn't
even
rise
to
the
level
of
bailey.
after
that
point,
all
he
did
was
possess
it
for
an
instant,
still
not
enough,
i'd
suggest,
to
qualify
as
active
employment
or
use
under
bailey,
the
most
recent
definition
that
we
have
available.
there's
an
argument
presented
by
the
government
that
feeds
off
of
smith's
use
of
924(d)
which
i
wanted
to
mention
briefly.
the...
and
that
is
the...
the
importation
of
the
definition
of
the
term
924(d),
the
forfeiture
provision
of
the
statute,
into
924(c).
in
smith,
the
court
held
that
there
were
predicate
offenses
for
924(d)
in
which
the
only
way
that
the
weapon
could
be
used
was
in
a
non-weapon
use,
which
is
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
the
smith
case,
and
therefore
the
court
found,
looking
at
those
predicate
offenses
that
had
non-weapon
uses
only,
that
therefore
the
term
924(d)
must
include
non-weapon
use.
that
logic,
however...
and
that's
the
argument
made
by
the
government...
that
doesn't
translate
into
the
situation
we
have
here.
it's
addressed,
by
the
way,
on
page
9
of
our
reply
brief
in
some
detail.
i'll
talk
about
it
briefly.
first
of
all,
924(d)
is
a
forfeiture
provision
and
the
focus
there
necessarily
is
on
the
firearm,
not
on
the
defendant.
the
language
in
924(d)
is,
quote,
"any
firearm
or
ammunition
intended
to
be
used
in
one
of
the
predicate
offenses.
"
that's
compared
with
924(c),
which
states
"any
person
who
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime
uses
or
carries
a
firearm.
"
so
you
have
firearm
intended
to
be
used
on
the
one
hand,
versus
a
person
who
uses
a
firearm.
one
might
say
perhaps
that
in
this
transaction
a
firearm
was
used,
but
not...
that's
a
different
thing
from
saying
that
mr.
watson
used
the
firearm.
it's
a
passive
versus
active
formulation.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
well,
ma'am,
i
think
under
smith
the
human
that's
using
the
firearm
in
the
transaction
is
actually
the
person
that
came
with
the
firearm
to
use
it
to
purchase
drugs.
and
as...
as
smith
said
that
that
was
definitely
a
use,
it
wasn't
even
really
contested
in
smith.
and
so
i...
and
i'm
not
contesting
for
this
case
obviously
that
that
person
that
showed
up
with
the
gun
is
using
the
gun
to
get
drugs.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
beg
your
pardon,
judge.
i
meant
that
the
court,
in
its
holding...
i
recognize
that
it
was
contested.
in
its
holding,
the
court
said
that
it
tended
to
focus
more
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
nonweapon
use
would...
would
be
required.
but
the...
certainly
as
between
the
two
parties
in
this
transaction,
the
guy
that
shows
up
with
the
gun
trying
to
use
it
to
get
drugs
is
certainly
making
use
of
it
in
a
way
that,
that
recipient
is
not.
the...
in,
in
smith,
the
court
reached
the
opinion
it
did
about
the
meaning
of
the
term
"use"
only
because
there
were,
there
were
predicate
offenses
in
which
the
only
uses
available
were
nonweapons
uses.
by
contrast,
here
the
predicate
offenses
that
are
suggested
to
import
this
definition
of
"use",
there
aren't
any
predicate
offenses
in
which
the
only
way
to
commit
the
offense
is
through
receipt.
i'll
grant
you
that
there
are
predicate
offenses
in
which
receipt
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
the
offense
can
be
committed,
but
it's
not
the
only
way.
and
so
that
logical
step
can't
be
made,
as
it
arguably
could
have
been
in
smith.
and
finally,
unlike
the
situation
in
smith,
here
we
know
that
the
predicate
offenses
can't
be
interpreted--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
in
smith
the
argument,
as
i
took
it
from
the
opinion,
justice,
was
that
the...
when
one
looked
at,
at
the
predicates,
there
were
several
which
had,
according
to
the
opinion,
only
nonweapon
uses.
so
if,
if
it's
used
or
intended
to
be
used
in
committing
one
of
those
offenses
and
one
looks
at
those
offenses
and
there's
only
nonweapon
uses,
then
so
the
argument
goes,
that
means
nonweapon
uses
are
part
of
use.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
agree
that
certainly
mr.
watson
didn't
use
it
in
any
weapons
sense.
so
if
there
is
a
use
at
all,
it
would
be
in
a
nonweapon
sense.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
i
believe
you're
right.
that
is
another
way.
it's
not...
it's
not
the
direction
that
we
went,
but
that
makes
sense.
the...
what
we
focused
on
was
use
or
not
at
the
first
instance.
and
smith
having
decided
that
in
that
case
use
and
defining
it
broadly
to
include
a
nonweapon
use
here,
we're
getting
to
the
point
where
there's
no
use
at
all
in
the
first
place.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
yes.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
would
suggest,
sir,
that
the
agreement
couldn't
rise
to
the,
to
the
level
of
active
employment
as
that
term
is
used
in
bailey.
in
other
words,
at
that
point
all
he
has
done
is
make
a
statement
that
he'll
accept
something
if
it's
offered.
whereas
in
bailey--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--we...
i
would
take
the
position
that
he
certainly,
in
a
situation
like
that
where
he
is,
he
is
not
possessing
the
gun,
he
is
expressing
his
intentions
or
desires
with
respect
to
it.
but
he
is
not
in
a
position
to
do
anything
more
than
that.
i
don't
think
that
that
fits
within
the
definition
of
"use".
i
don't
think
that
if
i
say
that,
that
i'd
like
to
buy
your
house
and
if
you'll
sell
it
to
me,
that
i'm
using
the
house.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
it
is
correct
that
when
he...
that
although
he
initially
wanted
to
ask
how
much
the
gun
was--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--factually
what
happened
was
that
he
wanted
to
buy
a
gun.
and
then
the
police
officer,
the
undercover
people
said,
well,
instead
of
giving
money,
we'll
take
drugs
for
it,
which
of
course,
brought
us
within
the
statute.
that's
the
factual,
particular
factual
circumstances
here.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
bailey.
i
have
this
court's
decision
in
bailey,
your
honor,
namely
there
that
it
can't
just
be
a
use.
even
if
we
were
to
go
ahead
and
hold
our
mouths
and
make
that
awkward
formation
and
say
what
he
did
was
a
use,
it's
still
not
rising
to
the
level
as
bailey
interpreted
the
term
of
active
employment.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
guess
ultimately--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--i
do
think--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
i
do
think--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--i
do
not
believe
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
overrule
smith
in
order
to
rule
for
the
petitioner
here,
because
of...
because
of
the
differences,
first
of
all
linguistically;
and
secondly
because
of
the
reliance
on
bailey.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
that's
correct.
that
being
said,
i
think
that
there
is,
there
are
arguments
that
can
be
presented,
they
were
presented
in
smith,
as
to
whether
one
could
take
one
position
or
the
other.
but
it
doesn't,
it
doesn't
do
violence
to
smith
to
hold
for
the
petitioner
here.
ultimately,
when
you
look
at
the
bailey
decision
and
at
the
facts
of
bailey,
and
there
you
have
people
riding
around
with
guns
in
the
trunk
of
their
car,
and
that's
held
not
to
be
a
use
within
the
statute.
well,
here
watson
didn't
even
do
that.
he
never
had
the
guns
in
the
first
place
going
into
the
transaction.
so
it
seems
to
me
if
bailey--
mr.
karl
j.
koch
--under
bailey,
however,
if
all
he
did
was
receive
the
gun,
hold
it
in
his
hand,
bailey
says
that's
not
enough,
that's
not
a
use.
and,
of
course,
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
as
bailey...
as
bailey
thought
very
clearly,
if
he
then
takes
the
gun
and
uses
it
to
communicate
a
threat
to
the
other
party,
then
he
is
making
a
use.
he
is
now
actively
employing
it,
in
this
case,
as
a
threatening
item.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
your
honor,
i
believe
if
the
jury
was
to
find
in
that
factual
scenario
that
that
was...
that
he
was,
in
fact,
silently
making
reference
to
the
gun,
then
i
think
that
gets
you
within
bailey.
there's
all
kinds
of
things
mr.
watson
could
do
beyond
what
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
would
turn
it,
what
he
did,
into
active
employment
and
use.
but
merely
getting
it
and
putting
it...
and
holding
it,
which
are
the
facts
in
this
record,
doesn't...
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
use
under
bailey.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
there
were...
there
were
actually
two,
two
different
fact
patterns
in
the
consolidated.
one
had
a
gun
that
was
locked
up
in
another
room,
the
other
one
had
guns
in
the
trunk,
with
expert
testimony
being
that
that
was
the
typical
method
of
drug
dealers
to
protect
their
drugs
and
things.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
he
did
have
the
gun
in
his
hand
then
he
would
be
carrying
it
under
muscarello
and
the
other
cases.
that's
correct.
yes,
ma'am.
recognizing
again
i
just
would
point
out
that
whatever
condition
mr.
watson
had
the
gun
in
and...
in
this
record
that's
unloaded...
was
the
choice,
not
of
mr.
watson
but
of
the
people
that
brought
him
the
gun.
in
this
clip
fed
gun
it
was
up
to
him
whether
you
give
him
a
clip
or
not,
without
which
the
gun
is
useless,
which
in
this
case
was
the
choice
of
the
police
officers
as
to
how
they
were
going
to
hand
it
to
him.
i
have
no
other...
nothing
else,
unless
there's
any
questions.
mr.
karl
j.
koch
thank
you,
your
honor.
as...
as
i
indicated
before
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
to
overrule
smith
to
rule
for
the
petitioner,
but
if...
if
consistency
on
both
sides
of
the
transaction
is
desired
and
certainly
something
has
to
go,
i
would
suggest
it
ought
to
be
smith
because
otherwise
you're
stuck
with
bailey
and
with
what
i
suggest
are
settled
principles
of
statutory
construction.
the...
i
think
smith
takes...
takes
it
about
as
far
as
it
could
go,
and
you're
having
to
make...
you
have
to
make
a
number
of
linguistic
compromises
to
get
to
the
smith
result
to
begin
with.
the...
with
regard
to
the...
the
charging
as
possession
or
furtherance
or
not,
again
it's
not
before
us,
it's
not
part
of
this
case
i
would
suggest
that
mr.
watson
possessed
this
firearm
as
a
consequence
of
a
drug
transaction
rather
than
in
furtherance
of
a
drug
transaction.
i
do
think,
and
it's
obvious
from
other
statutes
in
the
neighborhood,
that
congress
certainly
knows
how
to
say
"receive"
and
"accept"
and
words
of
that
nature,
if
it
was
its
intent
to...
to
make
the
receipt
of
a
weapon
or
bring
that
within
the
ambit
of
this...
of
this
particular
statute.
i
don't
think
it's
enough
to
say,
as
my
opponent
does,
use
as
a
medium
of
exchange
if
it's
a
crime
for
example
to
use
a
forged
instrument.
the
guy
who
accepts
it
doesn't
use
it,
i
don't
think
by
any
reasonable
interpretation.
so
i
think
that
that...
that
really
stretches
this
farther
than
it
should
go.
lastly,
i
would
point
out,
and
again
this
is
in
our
brief
around
page
9,
with
respect
to
this
924(d)
argument,
one
of
the
predicate
offenses
that's
used
in
924(d)
is
922(j),
which
includes
language
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
receive,
possess,
conceal,
store,
barter,
sell,
or
dispose
of.
"
et
cetera.
well,
922(j),
yet
we
know
from
bailey
that
"possess"
in
and
of
itself
can't
be
a
use.
and
that's
just
one
of
the
reasons
why
that
argument
unfortunately
falls
apart
when
one
is
trying
to
import
those
definitions
of
use
into
this
statute.
i
have
nothing
further.
