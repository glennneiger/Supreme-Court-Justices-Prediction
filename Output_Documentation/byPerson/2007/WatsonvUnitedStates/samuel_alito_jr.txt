well,
if
we
look
at
this
transaction,
a
guns-for-drugs
transaction,
is
there...
can
you
think
of
any
good
reason
why
congress
would
want
to
prescribe
a
5-year
penalty
for
the
person
who
hands
over
the
gun,
but
not
any
penalty
for
the
person
who
receives
the
gun
and
hands
over
the
drugs?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
so
that
the...
the
risk
is
congress
was
worried
that
somebody
would
go
to
a
transaction
like
this
with
a
gun
originally
intending
to
trade
it
for
drugs
and
then
when
one
person
gets
there,
a
person
decides
to
shoot
somebody
with
the
gun?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that's
why
they
would
penalize
one
side
of
this
transaction
and
not
the
other?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
person
who
hands
over
the
gun
is
not
a
government
agent
or
informant,
is
there
any
doubt
that
the
person
who
hands
over
the
drugs
can
be
charged
with
using
the...
the
gun
under
18
u.s.c.
section
2(b)?
he
causes...
the
person
who
hands
over
the
gun,
to
do
something
that
is
a
crime.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you're
relying
on
the
language
of
924.
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
2(b),
is
there
any
doubt
that
this
situation
would
fall
squarely
under
it?
"whoever
willfully
causes
an
act
to
be
done
which
if
directly
performed
by
him
would
be
an
offense
against
the
united
states
is
punishable
as
a
principal.
