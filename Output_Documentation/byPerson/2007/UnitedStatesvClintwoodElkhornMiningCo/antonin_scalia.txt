mr.
jay,
is
the
government
running
with
the
fox
and
chasing
with
the
hounds?
you
want
us
to
apply
the
provisions
governing
the
internal
revenue
code
with
regard
to
whether
the
statute
has
expired,
but
when
it
comes
to
interest
you
say
oh,
no,
no,
no,
that
doesn't
apply.
why?
why
shouldn't
the
two
go
pari
passu,
as
we
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
yes,
they
make
the
same
mistake,
but
that
doesn't
justify
your
making
the
same,
the
same
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
either,
you
know,
they're
both
in
one
pot
or
they're
both
in
the
other
pot.
and
both
sides
want
to...
want
to
split
them
up,
but
why
don't
they
go
together?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i
thought
you
were
making
a
second
argument,
that
even
if
they
were
entitled
to
it
despite
the
statute,
they
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
interest.
you
don't
make
that
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
plus
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
certain
it
was
valid
if
this
coal
was
not
shipped
overseas.
you're
putting
an
awful
burden
on
the
government
to
know
when
the
coal
is
severed
and
shipped.
you're
saying
if
they
mistake
a
shipment
as
being
only
for
domestic
use
rather
than
for
shipment
abroad,
they
don't
have
any
basis
whatever
for
the
tax
claim.
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
export
clause
so,
so
significant?
the
only
other
self-executing
constitutional
clause
that
provides
for
damages
automatically
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
takings
clause.
and
we
have
allowed
the
states
to
require
claimants
to
jump
through
innumerable
hoops.
they
have
to
exhaust
all
their
administrative
remedies
before
they
can
bring
a
suit
here.
why...
why
is
the
export
clause
any...
any
more
sacrosanct?
justice
antonin
scalia
volenti
non
fit
injuria.
if
indeed
the
taxpayer
pays
out
the
money
for
an
unconstitutional
export
tax,
it
seems
to
me
that
person
has
no
claim
until
he
complies
with
the
administrative
procedures
that
render
that
tax
unconstitutional.
but
up
until
the
point
where
he
is
paying
it
voluntarily,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
saying
it
has
to
be
made
at
the
moment
they
pay
their
taxes.
i'm
just
saying
until
it's
made
there
is
no
unconstitutional,
unconstitutional
export
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
what
very
narrow
exception?
it
didn't
apply
the
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
the
two
go
together?
if
you
could
bring
an
injunction
action,
surely
you
don't
have
to
pay
the
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
what
she
is
saying.
she
is
saying
that
those
conditions
exist
here.
that
this
is
not...
not
a
plausible
tax;
and,
therefore,
she
could
have
gotten
an
injunction;
and,
therefore,
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
she
doesn't
have
to
go
through
the
tax
provisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
say
the
same
about
the
tax
on
oleomargarine.
it
is
a
perfectly
valid
tax
but
not
when
you
impose
it
on
nuts.
and
here
the
tax
on
coal
is
a
perfectly
valid
tax,
but
not
when
you
impose
it
on
coal
that's
in
the
stream
of
export.
