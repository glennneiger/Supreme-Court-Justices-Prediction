justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know,
what
happened
before
the
tucker
act
with
inverse
condemnation
claims?
the
government
violates
the
fifth
amendment
takings
clause
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
takings
clause
applied
to
the
fifth
by
inverse
condemnation,
and
there
is
no
tucker
act.
was
there
a
constitutional
cause
of
action
for
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
there
any
other
cases
where
they
said,
well,
it's
not
in
the
stream
of
commerce
yet,
and
there
was
an
intermediate
broker,
or
anything
like
that?
are
there
any
complexities
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
none
of
these
cases
did
they
have
those
sorts
of
problems?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
here
there
was
a
payment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
different
than
if
you
try
to
enjoin
the
collection
at
the
outset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
argument
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
we...
if
we
accept
your
view
in
this
case,
they
can
go
in
a
district
court
and
enjoin
them.
it's
not
a
tax.
the
tax
injunction
act
doesn't
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
which
is
just
what
justice
ginsburg's
questions
point
out.
and
earlier
i
had
indicated
that
in
this
case
they
did
pay
the
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
distinction.
it
may
be
that
you
would
prevail
in
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they
tried...
if
they
tried...
do
you
think
they
could
enjoin
the
collection
of
a
tax
refund?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
i
mean,
in
your
argument
you
say
it
is
absolutely...
that
it
doesn't
apply.
just
get
an
injunction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
we'll
invent
the
hypothetical
company
that
is
going
to
go
broke
and
all
that
stuff.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
you're
saying
it
isn't
a
tax
for
your
purposes,
and
then
in
my
hypothetical
case
you
say
you
have
to
go
through
the
tax
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
same
with
your
answer,
what
i
thought
was
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
interest
the
same
in
amount
in
either
case?
