it
might
help
if
you
raise
that
lectern
a
bit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
thank
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
shouldn't
it
be
a
suit
contesting
the
constitutionality?
i
mean,
in
the
usual
case
where
you
seek
a
refund,
there
are
adjustments
that
have
to
be
made.
but
here,
if
the
only
question
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax,
then
what
is
the
point
of
going
through
any
kind
of
administrative
process
of
the
refund
route?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
7422(a)
had
said
any...
any
internal
revenue
tax,
including
a
tax
imposed
in
alleged
violation
of
the
export
clause,
that
would
cut...
cut
out
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations,
right?
if
it
said
the
refund
procedure
applies
to
any
internal
revenue
tax
including
one
imposed
in
alleged
violation
of
the
export
clause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing
different
from
what
it
is
now,
but
just
congress
makes
clear
that
a
tax
and
alleged
violation
of
the
export
clause
falls
within
the
term
"any
internal
revenue
tax"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
didn't
have
to
pay--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
what
about
the
deficiency
procedure?
and
i
don't
know
if
that
applies
with
excise
taxes,
but
suppose
they
didn't
pay
this
tax
and
they
get
a
notice
of
deficiency.
where
would
they
go?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
it's
both.
you're
not
saying
it's
"either/or"
because
for
three
years
you
did
use
the
refund
procedure.
so
you
used
the
refund
procedure
for
the
years
that
were
within
the
three-year
period,
and
then
for
the
years
that
were
outside
the
three-year
period,
you
have
this
other
theory.
so
you're
not
saying
this
is
not
for
refund.
that
route
is
closed.
the
only
route
is
this
constitutional...
this
claim
directly
under
the
export
clause.
but
your
own
conduct
seems
to
have
been
it's
our
option.
we
can
treat
it
as
a
refund
claim
or
we
can
treat
it
as
a
constitutional
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
what
were
you
just
telling
us
is
that
this
is
not
a
refund
claim;
this
is
a
constitutional
claim.
but
you
are
now
saying,
i
think,
that
it's
both;
it's
whatever
the
taxpayer
or
the
plaintiff
wants
it
to
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying
you
get
interest
too
in
either
way.
you're
saying...
i
thought
you
said
for
the
three
years
that
are
within
the
three-year
refund
limit,
you
get
interest
and
then
you're
also
saying,
going
back
six
years,
you
also
get
interest.
you're
not
saying
that
if
you...
if
you're
outside
the
refund
procedure
you
don't
get
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
2411...
2411
is
what
you
use
in
the
court
when
you
have
a
straight
tax
refund
claim.
it's
not
as
though
2411
is
there
for
some
other
claim.
it's
what
you
get
when
you
go
to
court
and
you're
suing
for
a
refund.
that's
2411.
that's
applicable
if
you
get
a
judgment
for
an
overpayment
in
respect
of
any
internal
revenue
tax.
that's
what...
it's
in
title
28,
but
that's
what
it's
for.
it's
for
an
overpayment
in
respect
of
any
internal
revenue
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
the
use
of
any
internal
revenue
tax,
and
your
whole
argument
is
this
isn't
an
internal
revenue
tax.
so
it's
clearly
not
an
internal
revenue
tax
that
you
have
a
constitutional
claim
directly
under
the
constitution,
so
how
does
it
become
for
purposes
of
2411
an
internal
revenue
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
agree
in
your
basic
claim
that
if
the
government
is
treating
it
as
an
internal
revenue
tax,
which
it
certainly
didn't,
you'd
say
that
works
only
for
the
interest,
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
jay,
i
hope
in
the
15
minutes,
you
will
state
what
the
government's
position
is
on
this
enochs
case
that's
been
mentioned
at
least
a
dozen
times.
