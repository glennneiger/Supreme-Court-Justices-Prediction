mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
sought
and
received
a
full
refund
of
the
tax
they
paid
on
exported
coal
for
the
full
three-year
period
permitted
them
by
the
tax-refund
statute.
what
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
permitted
them
to
do
was
to
bring
an
additional
action
for
indistinguishable
relief,
but
for
a
three-year
period
beyond
what
the
tax-refund
statute
permits.
we
submit
that
that
decision
was
erroneous
for
two
principal
reasons:
first,
the
plaintiff--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--hang
on.
is
that
better,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
jay
thank
you.
the
plain
and
unabiguous
terms
of
the
tax-refund
statute,
section
7422(a),
expressly
provide
that
any
claimant
who
alleges
that
a
tax
has
been
illegally
assessed,
no
matter
the
reason,
must
before
proceeding
to
court
file
a
refund
claim
with
the
internal
revenue
service
within
three
years
after
filing
the
tax
return
on
which
the
illegal
tax
was
paid.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
interest
provision
is
in
fact
a
key
part
of
the
tax-refund
statute
and
so
respondent's
attempt
to
invoke
the
tax-refund
judgment
interest
provision
is
inconsistent
with
their
theory,
that
they're
proceeding
outside
the
scope
of
the
tax--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
we
think,
your
honor--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
we
think
the
whole
case
is
in
the
title
26
pot,
your
honor,
that
the
whole
case
should
proceed
under
the
provisions
of
title
26,
meaning
that
respondents
have
already
received
the
full
tax
refund
to
which
they
are
entitled.
and
to
be
sure,
they
received
interest
on
that
refund.
and
had
they
to
sue
for
it,
they
would
have
received
interest
under
section
2411.
but
because
they
are...
because
they
are
no
longer
able
to
proceed
under
the
exclusive
tax-refund
procedure,
of
course
we
think
that
they...
that
they
can't
plead
around
that
by
claiming
constitutional
damages
instead.
but
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
them
and
agree
that
they
could
pursue
damages
for
a
violation
of
the
export
clause,
section
2411
does
not
apply
to
such
a
claim
because
it's
not
a
claim
for
an
overpayment
of
tax.
the
term
6402,
which
is
the
linchpin
of
the
tax-refund
statute.
and
the...
when
a
taxpayer
has
made
an
overpayment,
that
triggers
the
obligation
of
the
irs
to
provide
a
tax
refund
if
one
is
timely
sought,
and
if
one
isn't
timely
sought,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
brockamp
case,
the
congress
has
provided
an
unusually
emphatic
limitation
on
the
commissioner's
ability
to
refund.
mr.
william
m.
jay
that's
right.
mr.
william
m.
jay
that's
right.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
on
the
interest,
your
honor,
we're
saying
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
interest
on
the
three
years.
mr.
william
m.
jay
it
is
the
former,
your
honor--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--because
we're
saying
that
because
respondents
waited
for
21
years
while
paying
the
tax
without...
without
filing
a
refund
claim,
that
they're
limited
to
the
three
years
immediately
preceding
the
refund
claim--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--no.
if
they
were
entitled
to
sue,
not
under
the
tax...
under
the
tax
code
at
all,
but
on
the
theory
countenanced
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
this
is
not
a
suit
for
a
tax
refund
at
all,
but
a
suit
for
damages
arising
directly
under
the
constitution--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--then
there
is
no
provision
in
title
28
or
anywhere
else
that
provides
the
required
express
provision--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--of
interest
that's
necessary
to
award
interest
against
the
government.
mr.
william
m.
jay
in
the
context
of
the
coal
tax,
your
honor,
and
the
export
clause
claim,
the
purpose
of
requiring
exhaustion,
requiring
respondents
to
proceed
before
the
irs,
is
that
the
coal
tax
is
exempt
from
taxation
under
the
constitution
only
if
the
coal
at
the
moment
the
tax
is
imposed,
which
in
this
case
is
when
it's
first
sold
by
the
manufacturer,
the
mining
company,
if
at
that
moment,
the
coal
was
in
the
stream
of
export.
and
in
the
context
of
the
coal
industry
that
can
be
a
fairly
fact-specific
question,
and
the
irs
technical
advice
memorandum
that
we've
cited
on
page
11
of
our
reply
brief
explains
that
to
some
degree.
so
it's
possible
for
a
timely
refund
claim
to
allow
the
irs
to
examine
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
transaction
and
determine
whether
in
fact
the
coal
was
in
the
stream
of
export
at
all.
further,
the
irs...
if
it
has
only
an
excise
tax
return
from
the
taxpayer,
irs
has
no
idea
what
percentage
of
that
coal
was
exported.
well
over
90
percent
of
the
coal
mined
in
the
united
states
remains
in
the
united
states
and
there's
nothing
on
form
720,
the
excite
tax
return,
that
specifies
how
much
of
that
coal
is
exported.
so
effectively
by
filing
the
two-page
refund
claim
the
taxpayer
puts
the
irs
on
notice
of
what
percentage
of
coal
in
the
given
years
was
in
fact
in
the
stream
of
export
when
it
was
sold,
whether
in
fact
the
broker
or
whoever
purchased
it
actually
purchased
it,
actually
exported
it
from
the
country,
and
also
how...
what
the
dollar
amount
of
tax
refund
is
being
sought.
so
all
of
those,
we
think,
are
perfectly
valid
purposes
for
requiring
a
short
but
reasonable
time
to
proceed
before
the
irs.
and
if
the
irs
denies
the
claim,
then
of
course
respondents
could
have
proceeded
directly
to
court.
the
irs
did
not
in
fact
deny
their
claim,
and
the
irs
has
issued
a
notice
of
acquiescence
specifying
that
the
coal
tax...
coal
taxpayers
who
paid
this
coal
tax
and
filed
timely
refund
claims
will
receive
a
refund
to
the
full
extent
that
congress
has
permitted
the
irs
to
grant
refunds.
mr.
william
m.
jay
plus
interest,
that's
right,
your
honor.
under
section
6611,
interest
is
fully
available
on
refunds.
and
again,
if
the...
if
the
irs
had
denied
the
claims
and
respondents
had
been
forced
to
go
to
court,
they
would
have
received
interest
accounting
for
that
time
delay
as
well.
so
we
think
that
section
7422
is
the
exclusive
means
of
bringing
a
claim
that
a
tax
was
illegally
or
erroneously
assessed
or
collected.
the
terms
of
the
statute
are
clear;
they're
unambiguous;
and
they're
exclusive.
7422(a)
simply
is
the
only
way
of
bringing
this
claim.
and
we
think
that
whether
respondents
denominate
their
claim
as
a
statutory-refund
claim
or
a
constitutional
claim,
the
terms
of
section
7244(a)
plainly
cover
it.
so
we
think
that
the
court
need
not
necessarily
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
export
clause
creates
a
self-enforcing
cause
of
action
at
all.
mr.
william
m.
jay
to
file
a
timely
refund
claim,
your
honor?
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
the
constitutional
violation
would
have
taken
place
before
in
your
honor's
hypothetical.
mr.
william
m.
jay
in
the
mckesson
case,
your
honor,
the
court
outlined
a
number
of
the
options
that
taxing
authorities
have
to
respect
their
strong
fiscal
interest
in
the
stability
of
their
tax
revenues
while
providing
appropriate
relief.
and
the
court
listed
as
one
way
in
which
states
can...
states
and
other
taxing
authorities
can
protect
that
by
providing
a
short
statute
of
limitations.
the
court
also
suggested
that--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
your
honor,
in
mckesson
the
court
pointed
to
another
alternative,
which
is
requiring
that
the
tax
be
paid
under
protest.
and
that
effectively
is
a
statute
of
limitations
of
zero
days,
in
that
when...
you
know,
that
when
the
tax
is
paid,
the
taxpayer
has
to
identify
the
basis
of
the
constitutional
challenge
and
the
amount
being
paid
under
protest.
and
under...
and
before
the
tucker
act,
and
indeed
in
the
early
years
of
the
tucker
act,
taxes
had
to
be
paid
under
protest
or
the
taxpayer
was
out,
was
out
the
remedy
against
the
collector.
and
congress
has
since
provided
that
in
general
taxpayers
don't
have
to
pay
their
taxes
under
protest.
instead,
they
can
bring
a
refund
claim
within
three
years
afterwards.
but
that
three-year
limitation
period,
while
relatively
generous,
is
absolute.
and
the
court
held
in
the
brockamp
case
that
the
three
years
can't
be
extended,
not
even
for
an
individual
taxpayer
suffering
from
senile
dementia
for
the
entire
time
period.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
we
think...
i
want
to
clarify,
your
honor,
that
any
lawsuit,
whether
it's
on
respondent's
theory
or
on
our
theory,
any
lawsuit
that's
filed
is
in
fact
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
william
m.
jay
if
the
only...
if
the
only
basis
for
the
taxpayers'
recovery
is
that
the
taxpayer
has
paid
a
tax
and
the
tax
was
illegally
or
erroneously
assessed
because
it
was
unconstitutional,
we
think
that
section
7422(a)
and
the
associated
time
limits
provide
the
procedure
for
recovering
under
the
tucker
act.
section
2501,
which
is
what
respondents
contend
is
the
only
procedure
that
applies
to
the
claims
that
they
have
brought,
section
2501,
as
the
court
recognized--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
the
congress
has
made
no
distinction
in
the
statute
between
one
type
of
constitutional
claim
and
another,
or
indeed
one
type
of
illegality
or
another.
and
we've
cited
some...
some
examples
in
our
opening
brief
of
numerous
constitutional
provisions
that
taxpayers
may
bring
challenges
under.
and
there
are
at
least
five
clauses
in
the
original
constitution
that
regulate
the
federal
government's
taxing
authority.
there
are
at
least
four
more
that
regulate
the
states,
and,
you
know,
not
to
mention
the
bill
of
rights.
so
constitutional
claims
are
commonly
brought
by
taxpayers
against
federal
taxes,
and
the
tax-refund
procedure
provides
a
full...
a
fully
effective,
fully
adequate
way
of
vindicating
that
right.
the
only
requirement
is
that
it
be
submitted
in
writing
to
the
irs
within
three
years
after
filing
the
tax
return
in
question.
mr.
william
m.
jay
before
there
was
the
tucker
act,
your
honor,
when
the
government
took
property
and
was
obliged
to
pay
compensation,
the
claim
was
presented
to
congress;
and
congress
could
legislative
relief
by
a
private
bill.
eventually,
congress
created
the
court
of
claims
purely
as
an
article
i
tribunal.
there
was
no
judicial
review
because
the
decisions
were
always
subject
to
revision
by
congress.
and
eventually
congress,
having
tired
of
adjudicating
all
these
claims
in
a
legislative
manner,
gave
the
court
of
claims
independent
status
with
its
decisions
reviewable
in
article
iii
courts.
and
so,
by
enacting
the
tucker
act,
takings
claims
became
brought
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
so,
because
we
think
section
7422(a)
is
a
completely
adequate
remedy
for
any
constitutional
claim
that
respondents
might
bring,
we
submit
that
this
court's
bivens
cases
and
this
court's
unlawful-tax
cases
show
that
there
is
no
warrant
to
create
a
new
cause
of
action
directly
under
the
constitution
in
circumstances
like
this
where
the
taxpayer
has
a
fully
effective
remedy,
allows
that
remedy
to
become
time-barred,
but
instead
brings
a
claim,
purportedly
under
the
constitution,
against
the
identical
defendant,
in
the
identical
forum
seeking
the
identical
relief.
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
has
never
fashioned
a
bivens-type
implied
cause
of
action
for
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
indeed,
in
bush
versus
lucas,
schweiker
versus
chilicky,
and
other
cases,
the
court
has
recognized
that
when
congress
has
legislated
a
remedial
scheme,
it
doesn't...
this
court
will
still
stay
its
hand
before
creating
a
new
bivens
action,
even
if
that
remedial
scheme
has
very
short
time
limits,
such
as
the
30-day
time
limit,
the
civil
service
remedies
that
were
at
issue
in
bush,
or
the
exhaustion
requirement
of
title
vii
which
substitutes
for
an
equal-protection
claim
for
federal
employees.
even
in
those
circumstances,
and
even
if
the
remedies
that
are
available
are
equitable
and
not
money
damages,
even
in
those
circumstances
this
court
will
not
create
a
new
cause
of
action
for
money
damages.
and
in
this
case,
if
respondents
had
filed
in
a
timely
way
in
this...
referring
to
the
relief
that
they're
seeking
in
this
case,
they're
seeking
relief
for
1994,
1995
and
1996.
if
they
had
filed
by
april
30th,
1997,
by
which
point
cyprus
amex
coal
company
was
already
vigorously
litigating
the
constitutionality
of
the
coal
excise
tax
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
if
they
had
filed
by
that
time,
they
could
have
received
full
relief.
so
their
failure
to
assert
their
rights
in
a
timely
way
certainly
didn't
give
the
court
of
appeals
warrant
to
create
a
new
bivens-type
implied
right
of
action.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'll
reserve.
mr.
william
m.
jay
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i'll
be
glad
to,
your
honor.
enochs
case
construed
not
section
7422,
but
section
7421,
the
injunction
act
provision
of
the
tax
code.
and
the
question
in
enochs
was
whether
the
taxpayer
simply
by
alleging
that
the
tax
was
so...
so
invalidly
applied
that
it
was
only
in
the
guise
of
the
tax
could
avoid
paying
the
tax
and
bring
an
injunctive
claim.
the
court
in
enochs
held
that
it
could
not
because
the
taxpayer
had
not,
in
fact,
satisfied
the
basic
requirement
of
all
claims
for
injunctive
relief
as
irreparable
injury.
and
the
court
also
held
that
whether
a
tax
is
defensible
for
purposes
of
this
very
narrow
exception
is
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
information
to
the
government
at
the
time
of
suit.
so
in
this--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--as
the
court
was
preserving,
i
think,
in
dicta,
though,
because...
because
the
court
ultimately
denied
the
exception
in
that
case
and
in
each
case
since,
preserving
the
holding
in
standard
nut
and
margarine,
a
case
from
the
1920's.
justice
breyer
alluded
to
this
when
he
asked
my
friend,
ms.
millett,
about
whether
this
exception
is
geared
primarily
to
factual
issues
or
to
legal
issues.
in
standard
nut
and
margarine
the
government
had
decided
to
attempt
to
impose
a
tax
meant
for
oleomargarine
on
a
product
made
entirely
from
nuts.
and
this
court,
you
know,
without
construing
the
tax-injunctive
provision,
simply
referring
to
principles
of
equity,
this
court
held
that
the
government's
theory
of
assessing
the
tax
was
simply
in
the
guise
of
a
tax
and
it
permitted
the
injunctive
claim
to
proceed.
in
williams
packing
the
government's...
the
government
had
a
collateral
basis
for
assessing
the
tax,
and
so
the
taxpayer
was
remitted
to
the
same
remedy
that
any
taxpayer
who
wants
to
challenge
a
tax
as
having
been
unlawfully
assessed
or
collected
is
subject
to;
that
is,
to
pay
the
tax,
file
a
refund
claim,
and
if
the
refund
claim
is
upheld
either
by
the
irs
or
subsequently
in
court,
to
receive
a
full
refund
with
interest.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
if
you
can
satisfy
the
requirements
for
injunctive
relief...
and
williams
packing,
the
taxpayer,
couldn't;
and
in
the
cases
since
the
taxpayer
couldn't...
then
the
court
can
enjoin
the
collection
of
the
taxes
applied
to
you.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
think
i
have
three
responses
to
that.
one
is
that
we
don't
think
that
a...
an
exception
to
the...
to
7421
should
carry
over
into
section
7422.
but
even
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
this
is
a
facially
constitutional
tax.
the
tax
is
imposed
on
coal
mined
in
the
united
states.
and
if
no...
if
none
of
the
coal
that
is
subject
to
the
tax
is
ever
in
the
stream
of
export
when
the
tax
is
imposed,
then
the
tax
is
perfectly
constitutional.
and
that
is
why
section
4121
remains
on
the
books
today.
the
tax
is
unconstitutional
only
in
certain
narrow
circumstances
when
the
coal
actually
is
is
in
the
stream
of
export.
as
i
explained--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--but
if
one
of
these
coal
companies
had
sought
to
enjoin
the
tax,
the
government
would
have
pointed
to
the
provision
in
williams
packing
that
says
that
whether
the
tax
is
defensible
is
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
information
available
to
the
government
at
the
time
of
suit
until
the
taxpayer
demonstrates
that
the
coal
is
actually
in
the
stream
of
export,
which
is
precisely
what's
done
during
the
refund
process
that
the
taxpayers
used
in
this
case
to
show
that
their
coal
was
in
the
stream
of
export
when
they
obtained
the
refund.
that's
what...
that's
how
they
obtained
a
full...
full
relief.
but,
in
any
event,
the
history
of
this
litigation
shows
that
this
is
not...
this
is
not
a
claim
about
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
the
tax
because
the
tax
continued
to
be
collected
without
protest
in
the
case
of
the
respondents
here
for
21
consecutive
years.
and
by
the
time
they
filed
for
a
refund
this
court
had
decided
ibm.
it
had
decided
u.s.
shoe.
the
district
court
had
decided
ranger
fuel,
and
the
government
had
announced
that
it
would
not
appeal
the
decision
in
ranger
fuel
striking
down
the
coal
tax.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
for
that...
for
that
entire
time
the
government
had
no
basis
on
which
to
defend
the
tax.
i
mean
the
government
had
colorable
arguments
to
defend
the
tax
at
issue
in
u.s.
shoe
in
june
1996.
and
it
had
colorful
arguments
to
defend
the
harbor
maintenance
tax
in
u.s.
shoe.
i
may
have
misspoke.
ibm
in
1996,
and
u.s.
shoe
in
1998.
so
to
say
that
during
the
period
at
issue
in
this
case,
1994
through
1996,
the
tax
was
so
facially
invalid
that
the
narrow
williams
packing
exception
to
another
statutory
provision
justifies
respondents'
attempt
to
circumvent
the
tax
refund
statute,
we
just
think
is
not
correct.
in
the
case
of
a
taxpayer
who...
who
can
satisfy
the
exception,
you
know,
the
tax
code
does,
indeed,
put
that
taxpayer
to
the
choice.
it
gives
them
a
fully
effective
post-payment
refund
remedy
where
they
can
avoid
any
penalties
and
interest
by
paying
the
tax
and
litigating
for
a
full
refund.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
don't
think
that
we
need
to
go
beyond
the
first
clause,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
mean
the
court
construed
a
similar
provision
in
flora
versus
united
states
in
1960,
which
explained
that
"any
sum"
is
a
cumulative
provision.
so
that
if
something
is
within
the
scope
of
an
internal
revenue
tax
alleged
to
have
been
erroneously
or
illegally
collected
or
assessed,
that's
as
far
as
you
need
to
go.
mr.
william
m.
jay
no.
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
holding
in
flora
is
that
if
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
the
first
provision,
then
you
would
need
to
look
at
the
second...
actually
the
third
provision,
the
"any
sum"
language.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
my
specific
response,
your
honor,
first
is
that
in
this
case
the
tax
simply
was
not
in
the
guise
of
a
tax.
but
even
if,
you
know,
today,
if
the
taxpayer
were...
if
a
taxpayer
were
alleging
that
the
coal
tax
were
in
the
guise
of
a
tax
and
that
it,
therefore,
could
bring
a
prepayment...
a
prepayment
action,
it
does
not
then
follow
that
the
taxpayer
could
still
after
the
fact,
if
it
opted
not
to
bring
that
prepayment
action,
the
taxpayer
could
then
escape
the
three-year,
nontollable,
unusually
emphatic
limitation
period
that
applies
to
a
claim
for
a
postpayment
remedy,
which
is
the
exclusive
means
of
obtaining
a
postpayment
remedy.
and,
you
know,
the
courts
recognized
time
and
again
that
taxing
authorities
have
a
strong
interest
in
fiscal
stability,
and
it
effectively
closes
the
books
on
a
particular
tax
year.
so
that
taxpayers,
after
the
tax
is
paid,
if
they
want
to
protest
the
tax,
they
have
three
years
in
which
to
put
the
government
on
notice.
that,
you
know,
even
if
the
claim
is
this
tax
is
so
beyond
the
pale
that
it
can't
be
defended,
they
have
to
put
the
government
on
notice
of
that
claim.
and
if
they
do,
then
the
irs
considers
it;
and
if
the
irs
turns
them
down,
then
they
can
proceed
to
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
federal
claims.
in
addition,
i
think
i
just
wanted
to
clarify
one
point
about
the
availability
of
prepayment
remedies
in
this
case.
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
my
friend,
miss
millett,
was
correct
about
the
fact
that
this
excise
tax
does
not...
is
not
susceptible
to
the
deficiency
proceeding
in
tax
court.
and
we
have
cited
in
footnote
7
of
our
reply
brief
at
page
16
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
another
route
if
the
taxpayer
feels
strongly
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
tax
and
is
willing
to
take
the
chance
that
if
the
taxpayer's
position
is
rejected,
that
the
taxpayer
may
be
liable
for
penalties
and
interest
for
not
paying
the
tax.
i
mean,
of
course,
the
general
rule
is
that
the
taxpayer
is
expected
to
pay
the
tax
and
proceed
postpayment
by
putting
the
irs
on
notice
of
the
claim.
but
congress,
in
section
6330(c)(2)(b)
of
title
26,
has
provided
some
limited
ability,
if
a
taxpayer
has
not
previously
been
able
to
litigate
the
merits
of
the
tax,
the
taxpayer
has
a
limited
opportunity
to
do
so
first
before
the
irs,
then
in
tax
court,
and
then
before
the
court
of
appeals.
and,
again,
on
miss
millett's
supposition
that
this
is
a
completely,
clearly
unconstitutional
tax,
then
the
taxpayer
would
have
the
option
of
doing
that.
again,
the
refund
scheme
is
set
up
so
that
if
the
taxpayer
doesn't
want
to
take
the
chance
that
its
argument
will
not
be
accepted,
the
taxpayer
has
a
simple,
open
remedy:
to
file
a
refund
claim
at
any
point
within
three
years.
that's
exactly
what
respondents
did
not
do
for
the
21
consecutive
years
that
they
paid
this
tax
without
complaint.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions?
