justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
explain
one
thing
to
me?
i
take
it
that
they...
everybody
says
they
went
through
all
the
right
irs
hoops
to
get
back
three
years'
worth
of
damages,
i.e.,
they
get
their
payments
back
and
they
get
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
they
want
is
they
want
three
years
before
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they're
too
late
under
title
26.
so
what
you're
saying
is,
one,
you
can't
get
any
interest
and,
two,
you
can't
get
your
money
back
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
saying
for
three
years
they're
home-free.
they
get
their
payment
back
and
they
get
their
interest.
now
let's
go
to
the
three
preceding
years.
i'm
a
little
confused
about
that
because
i
can't
work
out...
i
suppose
that
the
government
is
saying:
you
get
nothing,
you
don't
get
your
money
back,
and
you
don't
get
your
interest.
or
is
the
government
saying:
you
get
your
money
back;
you
just
don't
get
the
interest?
which
is
it?
and
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
the
latter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
point
is
that
you
don't
have
to
go
through
the
refund
requirements
of
7422
if
the
government
was...
although
it
did
ask
for
the
money
as
a
tax,
they
are
really
out
to
lunch?
i
mean,
the
trouble...
is
there
any
authority
for
an
argument
like
that?
i
mean,
the
trouble
i
guess
that
i
would
have
that
argument
is,
one
is
linguistic,
because
it
goes
on
to
say
"or
of
any
sum
alleged
to
have
been
excessive
or
in
any
manner
wrongfully
collected.
"
and
then
the
other
thing
is
just
common
sense:
suppose
you
have
an
insane
tax
collector.
you
know,
i
mean,
that
could
happen.
and
the
insane
tax
collector
they
discover
some
years
later
has
been
assessing
all
these
penalties
for
no
reason
and
people
have
been
paying
some
of
them
because,
terrible
tragedy,
terrible
thing.
but
i
guess
they'd
be
stuck,
i'd
always
thought,
with
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations,
so
even
those
it's
really
nuts.
now,
is
there...
is
there
any
authority
for
us
making
a
distinction
between
an
insane...
to
get
an
extreme,
an
insane
assessment
of
a
tax
and
just
a
wrongful
assessment
of
a
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
"any
sum",
"in
any
manner"?
you
know,
what
about
that
language?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"any
sum
in
any
manner
wrongfully
collected.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
their
argument
is,
i'm
terribly
sorry,
that
if
the
way
you're
hurt
is
you
paid
a
tax
you
shouldn't
pay
and
you
want
to
get
a
refund,
go
through
the
administrative
procedure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
looking
at
your
argument,
i
see
it
now,
i
think,
if
i'm
right.
you're...
that
it
would
have
very
broad
reach.
it
would
reach...
it
doesn't
just
concern
the
constitutional
claim;
it
concerns
any
claim
you'd
have
against
the
irs.
and
there's
authority
that
says
if
the
irs's
position
is
too
far
out,
you
can
go
get
an
injunction.
that's
what
you're
pointing
to.
and
then
you're
argument
is,
because
of
that
authority,
that
kind
of
an
exception
for
the
far
out
irs
claim
also
applies
to
the
statute
of
limitation
and
administrative
requirement.
and
your
problem
is
the
latter
has
never
been
held.
and
the
reason
that
that's
a
problem,
i
take
it,
is
because
when
you're
talking
about
injunctions,
you're
talking
about
basic
equity,
but
when
you're
talking
about
later
on
administrative
requirements,
there's
really
no
reason
they
couldn't
have
filed
the
claim.
and
if
we
were
to
accept
an
argument
on
the...
to
the
contrary
and
analogize
it,
it's
going
to
cut
through
rules,
regulations,
statutes,
constitutional
claims,
everything,
really
making
a
hash
of
their
provision
there...
of
the
administrative
provision.
so,
what
is
your
response
to
that
thought
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
do
you
want
to
do
about
your
argument,
as
i
hear
it,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
claim
that
you're
asserting
to
get
the
money
back.
it
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
irs's
defense
and...
well,
can
you
do
it
that
way?
can
you
say
the
word
"any
tax"
or
"any
claim"...
i
can't
remember
that
other.
what
was
it?
it
was
any...
"any
sum"...
"any
sum"
or
"any
tax".
can
you
say,
well,
it
means
one
thing
if
they
are
saying
that
the
reason
they
want
it
back
is
that
it
violates
the
constitution,
and
those
words
mean
a
different
thing
if
the
reason
that
you
want
it
back
is
it
violates
an
irs
reg;
it
violates
an
irs
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
doesn't
mean
anything
different
and
then
if
the
very
far-out
claim
to
a
tax
is
so
far
out
it
isn't
a
tax,
that
would
be
true
in
the
regulation
context,
in
the
statutory
context
as
well
as
the
constitutional
context.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
is
the
government's
view
that
the
money
that
they
are
seeking
here,
if
you
look
at
7422,
that
it
falls
within
the
language
of
any
internal
revenue
tax
alleged
to
be
erroneously
or
illegally
assessed
or
the
language
"any
sum
alleged
to
have
been
in
any
manner
wrongfully
collected.
"
or
both?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
when
i
decide
this
case,
i
should
forget
the
words
"any
sum"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
means
that
if,
in
fact,
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
word
"tax",
then
it
is
not
within
"any
sum"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
enochs...
she
is
quite
right,
your
opposing
lawyer...
it
says
the
exaction
is
merely
in
the
guise
of
a
tax.
and
when
it
says
it
is
within
the
guise
of
a
tax,
then
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
tax
injunction
act.
and
there
it
says
if
it
is
clear
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
government
ultimately
prevail,
the
central
purpose
of
the
tax
injunction
act
is
inapplicable.
and
then
it's
just
in
the
guise
of
a
tax.
and
that,
she
says,
is
the
test
we
should
apply
here.
so
that's
where
i
think
justice
ginsburg
began.
what
is
your
specific
response
to
that?
