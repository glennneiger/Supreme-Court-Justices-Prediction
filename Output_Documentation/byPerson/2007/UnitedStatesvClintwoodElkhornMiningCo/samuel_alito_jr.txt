do
you
think
there
are
any
circumstances
in
which
a
taxpayer
can
bring
a
claim
under
the
tucker
act
for
the
refund
of
an
unconstitutional
tax?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

well,
any
situation
in
which
such
a
suit
can
be
brought
without
having
filed
a
claim
previously
with
the
irs?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
just
to
be
clear,
so
your
argument
is
not
limited
to
the
export
clause.
it
doesn't
matter
what
provision
of
the
constitution
the
tax
violates.
the
same
rule
would
apply?
