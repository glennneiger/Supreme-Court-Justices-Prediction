ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction
and
the
problem,
as
this
court's
precedent
has
made
clear
in
enochs
versus
williams
packing,
is
that
if
government...
if
the
government
wants
to
enjoy
the
special,
extraordinary
protections
of
the
tax-refund
scheme,
it
has
to
assert
a
plausible
basis
for
tax
liability.
it
hasn't
done
that
here.
there
was
never
any
claim
that
they
have
any
legitimate
right
to
this
revenue
as
a
source,
as
a
basis,
for
taxes;
that
they
have
any
legitimate
tax
regulatory
power
over
this
export
process;
or
that
they
have
any
legitimate
basis
for
defending
the
statute
as
constitutional
under
any
circumstances
of
the
law--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--justice
stevens,
that's
because
my
clients
are
not
fortune
100
companies,
and
i
don't
think
the
constitution
or
the
congress
imposes
a
tax
or
tax
code
that
require
that
sort
of
level
of
scrutiny.
i've
got...
we've
clients
here
that
are
small.
they
have
no
in-house
lawyers
and
they
had
accountants
who
paid
the
taxes.
and
so
the
short
answer
is
they
didn't
notice.
it's
not
that
they
looked
at
it
and
thought
it
was
constitutional.
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
as
soon
as
anybody
looked
at
this
statute,
as
soon
as
anybody...
the
courts,
the
government
that
collected
the
tax
for
20
years
and
did
have
a
constitutional
duty
to
look
at
the
constitution,
as
soon
as
anyone
looked
at
it,
there
was
no
defense
offered.
this
is
an
extraordinary
case,
where
the
government
made
no
effort
to
defend
this
tax
whatsoever
in
district
court.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice
kennedy,
there
is
a
statutory
definition,
26
u.s.c.
4221,
that
deals
with
stream
of
commerce
and
it
mirrors
this
court's
decision
in
the
a.g.
spalding
case,
which
says
that
either
the
direct
sales
or
if
your
manufacturer
doesn't
sell
directly
to
the
exporter
or
it
has
the
broker,
so
one
or
two
steps,
is
stream
of
commerce,
and
after
that
it's
not
going
to
be.
that's
the
same
thing
this
court
did
in
a.g.
spaulding.
if
someone
wanted
to
fight
about
that
statutory
application,
they
wouldn't
be
raising
a
constitutional
claim
like
we
are
here.
what
happened--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--not
in
these
cases.
my
clients...
i
think
almost
in
all
of
the
claims
they
directly
exported
it
themselves.
there
was
no
dispute
whatsoever.
if
there's
a
debate,
factually
or
legally,
about
whether
this
is
the
stream...
if
it's
not
in
the
export
stream.
if
it's
not
in
the
export
stream,
it's
not
an
export
or
a
violation.
if
there
is
a
factual
debate,
it
wouldn't
fall
within
the
enochs
versus
williams
packing
exception.
there
was
no
factual
debate.
there
is
a
stipulated
judgment
in
this
case.
what
enochs
tells
us,
again,
is
that
the
government
can't
have
a
tax
be
a
tax
solely
for
the
purpose
of
curtailing
constitutional
recovery.
that's
the
only
way
that
this
was
a
legitimate
tax
in
their
view,
not
to
collect
revenue.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
it
would
clear
up
an
awful
lot.
if
i
could
just
clarify,
though.
what
this
court
held
in
enochs
versus
william
packing
is
that
the
phrase
"any
tax"
only
applies
if
the
government
is
at
least
willing
to
assert
a
plausible
defense
for
the
tax.
and
so
it
would
depend
on
whether
any
tax
would
still
include
that
limitation
in
your
scenario,
if
they
are
willing
to
assert
a
plausible
export
clause.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
then
i
think
my
position
would
be
that
it
does
not,
because
this
court
has
held
for
half
a
century
without
congress
changing
it
that
any
tax
means
a
tax
that
the
government
asserts
is
valid.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
correct.
it
has
to
assert
that
it's
valid.
otherwise
it's
in
the
guise
of
a
tax
and
it
doesn't
fall--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
problem
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
were
two
statutes.
there
was
a
statute
imposing
the
coal
tax,
26
u.s.c.
4121...
this
is
all
on
the
first
page
of
our
brief...
and
then
there
was
an
amendment
to
the
exemption
for
exports
in
26
u.s.c.
4221
that
specifically
said
the
general
tax
exemption
for
exports
does
not
apply
to
this
coal
tax,
and
that
provision
captured
nothing
but
exports
of
coal.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
authority
is
this
court's
unanimous
opinion
in
enochs
versus
williams--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--which
said
that
if...
we
are
dealing
with
the
same
language...
no
suit
shall
be
maintained
for
any
tax
in
any
court.
and
it
said
in
that,
that
statutory
language,
"any
tax"
means
something
that
the
government
can
plausibly
defend
as
a
tax.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
again,
the
key
language--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
this
court
dealt
with
that,
i
think
it's
in...
i
think
in
dalm,
and
sometimes
it
has
its
own
rules
in
the
taxing,
but
this
is...
the
question
is
any
tax,
and
any
tax
doesn't
mean
something
that's
just
in
the
guise
of
tax,
whether
the
guy
is
insane
or
congress
just
forgot
to
read
the
export
clause.
but
as
soon
as
we
look,
everyone
knows
this
is
unconstitutional,
then
understand
what
the
impact
of
that
is.
that
means
the
only
way
this
is
a
legitimate
tax
under
the
government's
rule,
the
only
legitimate
tax
function
that
this
serves
is
to
cut
off
constitutional
remedies.
that's
its
only
role.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
this
court
said
in
enochs
that
you
don't...
that
tax...
the
whole
point
of
the
tax
exemption
act
is
to
funnel
everybody
in
for
tax
refund
procedure.
and
this
court
said
you
don't
have
to
go
if
it
is
not
a
tax.
and
what
they
mean
by
not
a
tax,
is
that
it
can't
plausibly
be
defended
by
the
government
as
a
tax.
this
doesn't
happen
often.
this
is
an
extraordinary
exception.
but
this
is
the
case
where
it
did.
and
if
the
government--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no.
it's
unbending
and
wrong
whether
it's
within
six
years
or
ten
years.
but
we
agree
that
a
constitutional
right
can
have
a
statute
of
limitation...
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right
that
doesn't
have
any
statute
of
limitations,
i
don't
know
what
it
is
and
it's
not
this
one.
the
question
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
because
it's
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
and
congress
determined
what
the
right
statute
of
limitation
is
for
a
constitutional
claim,
and
that's
six
years.
if
congress
had
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
under
the
tucker
act
for
all
constitutional
claims,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we
don't...
to
the
export
clause,
right,
distinguishes
between
three
years
and
six
years
in
its
own
right.
what
the
export
clause
does,
though,
there
is
the
statutory
construction
argument
and
we
have
the
enochs
argument,
but
we
also
think
there
are
substantial
constitutional
concerns
here.
and
the
export
clause
makes
it
most
imperative
for
this
court
to
continue
to
adhere
to
its
definition
of
any
tax,
and
that's
because--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--because
we
don't...
under
the
constitution
the
government
hasn't
done
anything
wrong
unless...
until...
unless
and
until
it
actually
effects
a
taking
and
doesn't
pay
for
it
through
process.
those
processes
are
how
we
determine...
get
to
the
point
where
there
has
been
an
actual
constitutional
violation
here.
no
administrative
process
is
necessary
to
have...
to
know
that
tax
has
been
posed
on
exports.
and
what's
distinct
about
the
export
clause,
to
get
back
to
chief
justice
roberts'
question,
is
that
it
is...
this
court
said
unanimously
in
u.s.
shoe,
a
simple,
direct,
unqualified
prohibition
on
congressional
tax
power
in
terms,
and
it
disallows
any
effort
to
raise
revenue
through
the
tax
power
act.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
congress
eliminated
in
the
early
1920s
any
prepayment
protest
requirement
under
the
tax
law.
and
the
tax
law...
the
internal
revenue
code
applies
sweepingly
to
americans
across
this
country,
vast
majority
of
whom
are
not
equipped
with
tax
lawyers
at
their
side
to
make
protests
at
the
moment
they
pay
their
taxes.
that's
never
been
required.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
right.
until
the
tax...
well,
it
would
be
an
unconstitutional
statute
on
the
books.
no
one
has
been
injured
by
it
or
affected
by
it
until
somebody
actually
pays
it
or
is
required
by
the
government
to
pay
it.
i
don't
dispute
that,
but
keep
in
mind
we're
dealing
with
a
tax
refund
scheme.
the
tax
refund
scheme
is
an
extraordinary
creature
in
the
law
for
many
good
reasons
but
that...
that
reverses
the
order
of
everything.
it
makes
you
pay
before
any
entitlement
has
been
shown
to
that
money
by
the
government.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it's
only--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's
only
different
in
the
sense
that
government's
interests
are
less,
and
the
government's
interests
are
most
acute
in
having
people
pointed
to
the
tax-refund
scheme,
this
court
has
said
time
and
again,
before...
to
pay
first
and
fight
later.
and
as
a
result...
i
mean,
if
it's
most
acute--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there...
there's
nowhere
for
them
to
go
for
this
particular
tax.
you
can't
go
to
tax
court.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
because
tax
court
doesn't
apply
to
excise
taxes
for
the
most
part.
there
may
be
a
few
exceptions.
it
essentially
applies
to
income
gift
and
estate
taxes,
and
it
certainly
didn't
apply
to
this
provision
here.
they
could
have...
they
could
have
gotten
the
assessment
and
gotten
on
the
phone
with
an
irs.
otherwise
they'd
have
to
wait
for
a
lien
or
levy.
now,
the
government,
by
the
way,
has--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
know.
we
couldn't
have--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
they
couldn't
because
in
addition
to
showing
the
government's
imposition
of
the
tax
is
legally
indefensible,
you
still
have
to
show
entitlement
to
an
injunction,
and
unless
you
can
establish
irreparable
harm
just
by
paying
money,
which
i'm
not
aware
of
any
coal
company
that
could
have,
you
could
have
gotten
an
injunction.
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--you
can't
get
an
injunction
just
because
something
is
unlawful.
that's
never
been
allowed
under
equity.
you
also
have
to
show
irreparable
harm.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
i
mean,
it's
not
a
question
of
inventing.
this
court
dealt
with
exactly
that
question
in
enochs,
where...
enochs
versus
williams
packing,
and
later
again
in
south
carolina
versus
regan,
and
commissioner
versus
shapiro...
that
you
can't
just
come
in
and
say
it's
unlawful,
that
you
actually
have
to
then
establish
irreparable
harm.
everything
in
the
tax
scheme
points
to
taxpayers
with
enormous
penalties
and
enormous
risks
to
pay
first,
fight
later.
and
when
a
taxpayer
does
that,
it's
also--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's
the
government
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's
the
government
that
wants
to
have
it
both
ways.
it
wants
to
say
it
is
a
tax
just
for
purposes
of
making
it
a
nonconstitutional
case
under
the
tucker
act
and
to
make
it
the
tax
scheme,
but
in
no
way
is
this
defensible
as
a
tax.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
have
two
responses:
one,
it's
going
to
have
far
less
effect
on
this
situation,
in
the
post-payment
situation,
than
it
did
in
enochs,
where
it
wasn't
limited
to
the
export
clause.
this
situation
is
only
going
to
work
where
you
not
only
establish
the
government
has
no
basis
for
this
tax,
a
hard
thing
to
do,
but
that
you
have
a
money-mandating
constitutional
provision.
there
aren't
many
of
them.
if
you
don't
have
a
money-mandating
position,
you've
got
nowhere
else
to
go
but
the
tax
scheme.
so
it's
extremely
limited,
but
i
want
to
get
back...
this
is
not
about
an
equity
rule.
this
court
was
specific
in
enochs
versus
williams
packing,
when
it
said,
our
prior
decision
under
miller
versus
standard
nut,
in
which
you
had
done
a
more
generous
view
of
this
get
around
the
tax
injunction
act,
was
wrong,
because
the
tax
injunction
act
is
not
an
equitable
rule.
enochs
was
a
statutory
construction
rule.
pages
6,
7,
and
8
of
that
decision
make
it
plain
in
terms...
you
talk
about
what
the
act
requires,
and
the
language
of
this
court
is
construing
is
the
phrase
"any
tax".
and
if
it
has
no
legitimate
basis,
then
it's
in
the
guise
of
a
tax.
that
same
language
has
been
on
the
books
for
almost
half
a
century.
congress
went
back
from
the
tax
injunction
act
eight
times
without
changing
it
in
response
to
this
court's
decisions.
enochs
has
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
five
times.
congress
enacted
an
entirely
new
internal
revenue
code
in
1986
that
used
that
7422,
with
this
court's
five
decisions
on
the
book
and
kept
that
language.
and
it
makes
sense.
congress
doesn't...
doesn't
enact
a
tax
where
it's
only
tax
function--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
not
saying
that
"any
tax"
means
anything
different.
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
if
you
succeed--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
because
you
have
to
have
a
money-mandating
claim
under
the
constitution
to
fall
within
the
tucker
act.
the...
this
court
said,
the
tucker
act
for
purposes
of
the
statutory
claims
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
as
this
court
said
in
kreider,
takes
three
years
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
so
i
don't
think,
after
kreider,
that
you
would
still
have
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations
under
the
tucker
act
for
a
statutory
tax
claim.
the
difference
is
constitutional
enforcement,
and
this
is
fundamentally
a
constitutional
right
that's
being
enforced.
and
the
question
is,
would
congress
had
thought...
this
is
all
a
question
of
statutory
construction...
would
congress
have
thought
this
is
more
a
constitutional
claim
or
a
tax
claim?
and
they've
made
the
sensible
decision,
at
least
as
this
court
construed
it
in
enochs,
in
south
carolina
versus
regan...
addressed
it
in
janis
and
bob
jones
university
and
the
americans
united
case,
all
of
which
are
in
our
brief--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--one
can
get...
there
is
nothing
in
the
tax
administrative
scheme
where
one
when
shows
up
to
file
a
tax
refund
where
you
say
if
i
go
by
this
route,
i'm
waiving
all
others.
it's
not
like
i'm
agreeing
to
go
go
through
arbitration
and
forgoing
my
rights
to
go
through
a
court
procedure.
congress
has--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it's
a
constitutional
claim
to
get
your
tax
money
back.
that's
right.
and
the
administrative
scheme
is
fully
amenable
to
that.
that's
certainly
the
government's
position,
and
we
don't
disagree.
the
question
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes.
absolutely.
we
could
get
it
on
both
grounds,
but
you
get--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
but
that's
because
we're...
i
mean,
there's
a...
there's
a
separate
interest
provision
in
the
tax
code
for
the
administrative
refund
procedure.
they
don't
really
an
28
u.s.c.
2411.
i
think
it's
26
u.s.c.
6511.
but
there's
a
specific
administrative
brief
on
tax...
i'm
sorry,
interest
provision
for
the
administrative
refund
scheme.
and
so,
under
that,
when
you're
in
the
administrative
scheme,
you
get
what
the
administrative
scheme's
interest
provision
gives
you.
we
don't
dispute
that.
and
then
the
question
is,
once
you've
gone
to
court,
the
relevant
interest
provision
is
the
one
in
28
u.s.c.,
not
in
the
tax
code,
by
the
way,
but
in
28
u.s.c.,
providing
them...
providing
for
interest
when
you've
recovered
an
overpayment
of
taxes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
because
in
2411
it
cross-references
the...
well,
let
me
clarify.
there
is
one
potential
wrinkle,
but
generally
speaking
2411
if
you
look
at
it,
and
it's
at
the
end
of
the
cross-references--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--this
is
all
on
page
4a
of
the
government's
brief
if
you
want
to
see
where
it
cross-references
the
internal
revenue
interest
provisions.
no,
there's
nothing
there
that
says
you
have
to
have
gone
through
the
administrative
scheme.
all
you
have
to
have
is
an
overpayment.
if
you
have
an
overpayment,
under
bonwit
teller--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question,
justice
ginsburg.
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
you
don't
have
to
go
through
the
refund
scheme
to
get
this.
this
interest
would
apply
in
bonwit
teller
for
accounts
stated,
in
the
rosenman
case
for
deposit
on
taxes.
that's
how
we
read
it.
your
second
point,
yes,
that
if
we
say
this
is
not
a
plausible
tax
under
enochs
versus
williams,
that
i
think,
and
if
this
court
agrees,
that
this
is
not
a
tax
under
enochs
versus
williams,
so
that
we're
not
bound
by
7422,
then
i
agree
that
our
interest
argument
becomes
harder
at
that
point
textually.
i
will
tell
you
that
i
still
think
the
fact
that
they
say
"in
respect
of
any
internal
revenue
tax.
"
gives
us
room
to
say
that
where
the
government
has
at
least
treated
it
and
collected
the
money
as
though
it
were
an
internal
revenue
tax,
that
might
be
a
way
to
get
interest.
if
this
court
agrees,
though,
that
it's
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--only...
i'm
sorry.
only
because
we
have
the
"in
respect
of
language".
that's
the
only...
but
if
this
court
disagrees
with
that,
and
we
recognize
it's
harder
if
this
court
agreed,
we
have
a
separate
constitutional
argument
that
the
export
clause,
just
like
the
just
compensation
clause
requires
interest
paid
in
its
own
right.
and
so
that's
the
alternative
basis.
and
this
court,
of
course,
can
affirm
the
judgment
on
any
basis
supported
by
the
record.
but
i
want
to
get
back.
very
clearly
that
there
is,
the
bottom...
i
mean,
justice
scalia,
you
talked
about,
you
know,
which
pot
you
want
to
put
this
in.
the
rarity
of
this
case
and
what's
unique
about
it
is
that
the
government
came
in
agreeing
up
front,
stipulated
judgment,
no
fact
dispute,
no
law
disputes,
this
is
in
the
pot
of
no
legitimate
status
of
the
tax.
no
claim
whatsoever.
the
government
couldn't
think
of
anything.
but
for
purposes
of
limiting
your
constitutional
relief,
then
it's
in
the
pot
of
a
legitimate
tax
and
we
think
they
can't
have
it
both,
ways
and
particularly
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
this
is
ultimately
a
question
of
which
scheme
is
better
fitted
to
vindicating
the
constitution.
and
congress
said
any
tax,
just
like
it
said
in
the
tax
injunction
act.
this
court
has
said
what
any
tax
means.
it
said
it
five
times
after
enochs.
and
congress
has
not
reacted
to
it.
stare
decisis
applies
most
powerfully
in
the
statutory
construction
congress...
context,
and
if
congress
thought
there
were
a
problem
with
what...
with
how
this
court
defined
any
tax,
it
would
have
said
so.
it
could
have
done
so.
it's
had
half
a
century
to
do
something.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
the
tucker
act
doesn't
use
the
word
"any
tax"
in
defining
the
statute
of
limitations.
it's
a
statute
of
limitations
for
constitutional
claims.
our
argument
is
what
the
word
7422
and
does
it
force
us
to
go
through
the
tax
refund
scheme.
our
argument
is,
as
this
court
said
unanimously
in
enochs...
the
decision
has
never
been
questioned
by
any
justice
of
this
court...
that
any
tax
does
not
apply
if
it
had
no
tax
status
for
any
other
purpose.
it
can't
be
just
to
limit--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
not
sure...
i'm
not
sure
it
would
have
come
out
differently.
maybe
they
would
have
explained
things
differently.
but
this
court
said
in
most
cases
the
question
is
which
statutory
scheme
is
better
fitted.
and
at
two
levels
we
think
the
tucker
act
is
better
fitted
for
this
claim.
one,
because
any
tax
only
applies
when
there
is
asserted
legitimate
basis
for
the
tax;
and
two,
the
export
clause
is
a
unique
limitation,
specifically
denies
the
government
any
authority
to
use
exports
as
a
source
of
revenue.
and
you
have
a
refund
scheme
here
that
has
been
designed
over
the
years
specifically
to
protect
revenue
interest,
to
make
you
pay
the
revenue
first
and
have
them
hold
it.
it's
not
just
holding
them
for
six
months.
they
had
to
pay
every
two
weeks.
but,
of
course,
the
government
didn't
treat
that
as
paid
for
purposes
of
interest
until
the
end
of
the
quarter
when
a
return
was
filed.
that's
one
way
why
the
interest
calculation
might
be
different
under
the
tucker
act
than
it
would
be
under
the
refund
scheme,
just
the
timing
of
whether
it's
the
deposit
or
the
actual
return.
justice
kennedy,
i
forgot
to
get
back
to
you
on
that.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
the
export
clause
can
be
fully
enforced
by...
which
it's...
it's
not
a
suggestion
and
it
doesn't
say
when
you're
doing
your
tax
stuff,
it's
okay
if
you
slop
on
on
exports
a
little
bit.
exports
are
completely
off
limits
to
the
tax
power.
and
congress
using
its
tax
power
to
create
a
tax
scheme
that
specifically
preserves
and
protects
revenue
and
is
not
a
revenue
neutral
system
is
not
the
best
scheme
for
vindicating
the
export
clause.
it's
not
better
for
that.
it
is
at
cross
purposes
with
the
export
clause.
but
the
bottom
is
this
court
doesn't
need
to
get
to
that
constitutional
question.
we
think
it
certainly
informs
the
analysis.
it
certainly
is
enough
of
a
constitutional
concern
or
doubt
to
conclude
that
enochs
still
applies
any
tax
in
the
tax
injunction...
any
tax
in
any
court.
no
suit
shall
be
maintained
for
any
tax
in
any
court
means
the
same
thing
in
7422
that
it
means
in
the
tax
injunction
act.
if
congress
thought
it
meant
something
different,
it
has
had
half...
almost
half
a
century
to
tell
us.
it
hasn't
done
that,
and
the
export
clause
can't
serve
its
unique
historical
function
of
keeping
government's
tax
regulatory
hands
off...
hands
off
the
tax
export
process
and
the
revenue
out
of
the
federal
fisc
unless
this
is
treated
as
a
constitutional
claim.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
