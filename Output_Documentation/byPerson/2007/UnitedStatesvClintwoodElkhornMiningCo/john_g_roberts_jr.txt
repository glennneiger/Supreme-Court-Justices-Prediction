chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-308,
united
states
versus
clintwood
elkhorn
mining
company.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
the
irs
say
that
the
statute...
or
congress,
i
guess,
say
the
statute
of
limitations
is
one
month?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
anything
after
that,
any
constitutional
violation
after
that,
is
just
not
remediable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
five
weeks
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
talking
about...
we're
talking
about
the
constitution
here.
and
in
effect...
i
mean,
i
assume
i
could
run
through
the
usual
routine.
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
say
they
could
have
a
statute
of
limitations
of
two
days,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
do
you...
i
take
it,
though,
that
you
concede
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
under
the
tucker
act,
right?
i
mean,
your
brief
says
this
is
an
unbending
and
unqualified
prohibition
on
the
use
of
exports
except
up
to...
if
it's
before
six
years
and
one
day.
you
are
taking
an
adamant
position
with
respect
to
three
years
but
you
give
up
six
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so...
so,
the
rhetoric
in
your
brief
how
this
is
a
constitutionally
based
prohibition
is
not
pertinent?
you're
saying
if
the
statute
was
clear
and
it
said
three
years,
that
would
be
fine,
even
though
it's
a
claim
under
the
export
clause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
plus
you
get
interest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
give
all
of
this
up
when
it
comes
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
mean,
the
government's
argument
could
be
just
as
implausible
as
you
suggested
it
is
here.
but
if
it
involves
a
claim
six
years
and
one
day
out,
it's
just
too
bad.
it
doesn't
matter
that
it's
a
constitutional
claim.
it
doesn't
matter
how
erroneous
the
government's
position
was,
because
the
government
can
impose
limitations
like
that
even
on
the
assertion
of
constitutional
claims.
that's
all
they
are
doing
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
say
just
as
unanimously
a
couple
of
things
last
year
on...
term
as
well
in
jencks
and
certainly
the
federal
circuit's
decision
wouldn't
have
come
out
the
same
if
they
had
had
hinck's
term
of
trust
on
the
books.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
jay,
you
have
15
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
the
third
case
beginning
this
afternoon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
other
tax
case
number
07-308
united
stated
versus
clintwood
elkhorn
mining
company.
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
tax
payer
seeking
a
refund
of
taxes
unlawfully
assessed
must
file
a
refund
claim
with
the
irs
before
bringing
suit.
this
refund
claim
must
be
filed
within
three
years
of
the
filing
of
the
tax
return.
read
together,
these
provisions
may
clear
that
a
tax
payer
cannot
bring
suit
against
the
government
for
a
refund
unless
a
claim
has
been
filed
with
the
irs
within
the
time
limits
that
i
just
described.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
three
coal
companies
who
were
subject
to
a
tax
on
coal
exports.
in
1998,
that
tax
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
under
the
export
clause
of
the
constitution
which
states
that
"no
tax
or
duty
shall
be
laid
on
articles
exported
from
any
state."
now,
after
the
coal
tax
was
invalidated,
the
companies
sought
refunds
of
the
taxes
they
had
paid.
for
taxes
paid
between
1997
and
1999,
the
companies
complied
with
the
refund
scheme
just
described
and
their
taxes
were
refunded
in
full,
with
interest.
they
could
not,
however,
comply
with
the
code's
refund
procedures
for
taxes
paid
between
1994
and
1996.
so
for
those,
they
went
straight
to
court
under
general
provisions
allowing
suit
against
the
government.
those
provisions
have
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations
more
generous
than
the
code
provisions.
the
court
of
appeals
let
them
do
that
but
we
will
not.
the
outcome
here
is
clear
given
the
plain
language
of
the
relevant
statutes
section
7422
of
the
code
states
that,
"no
suit
shall
be
maintained
in
any
court
for
the
recovery
of
any
internal
revenue
tax
alleged
to
have
been
erroneously
or
illegally
assessed
or
collected,
or
of
any
penalty
claimed
to
have
been
collected
without
authority
or
of
any
sum
alleged
to
have
been
excessive,
or
in
any
banner
wrongfully
collected
until
a
claim
a
for
refund
has
been
filed
with
the
irs.
what's
more,
the
time
limits
for
filing
such
a
claim
with
the
irs
apply
to
any
tax
imposed
by
the
internal
revenue
code.
given
that
language,
we
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
that
the
statute
covers
the
taxes
that
issue
here
and
bars
the
company's
suit.
now
the
companies
argue
for
a
different
result
here,
because
the
coal
tax
at
issue
was
assessed
in
violation
of
the
export
clause,
but
it
is
well
establish
that
constitutional
claims
can
be
time
barred
and
that
they
can
be
subject
to
administrative
exhaust
in
requirements.
we
do
not
see
anything
special
about
the
export
clause
or
about
the
taxes
that
issue
here
that
would
justify
overwriting
the
plain
language
of
the
statutes.
we
reversed
the
judgment
below,
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
