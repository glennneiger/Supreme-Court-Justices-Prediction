justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
where
as
i
took
it
he
identifies
a
problem
that
he
sees
in
this
portion
of
this
act
which,
should
the
limit
be
exceeded
by
our
opponent,
then
we
can
go
to
the
party
and
the
party
can
give
us
more?
now,
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
he
has
correctly
identified
a
problem
with
that.
now,
my
understanding
is
that
once
the
limit
is
exceeded
and
you
have
this
extra
amount,
three
things
happen:
one,
an
individual
could
contribute
two
or
three
times
the
amount
to
the
party
directly.
a
second
possibility
is
an
individual
who
has
exceeded
the
global
amount
now
gets
a
bump
up
and
can
contribute.
and
the
third
thing
is
the
party
thing.
so
focus
on
that
statute
where
this
is
written.
in
your
opinion,
if,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
there
were
a
problem
with
the
party,
would
that
particular
form
of
words
in
the
statute
be
severable
from
the
rest
of
it?
