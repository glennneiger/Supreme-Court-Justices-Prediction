mr.
andrew
d.
herman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
government
may
regulate
the
personal
spending
of
a
candidate
on
behalf
of
his
own
campaign.
this
is
an
activity
that
constitutes
political
expression
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment,
yet
bcra
section
319
seeks
to
deter
and,
failing
that,
penalizes
such
protected
political
expression.
even
if
this
court
finds
that
the
harms
upon
speech
of
section
319
are
modest,
the
provision
still
fails
to
satisfy
any
constitutional
standard.
it
furthers
no
legitimate
governmental
purpose
and
conversely
increases
the
undue
influence
of
contributions
upon
federal
candidates.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
harm
from
section
319
is
that
he
is
burdened
from
the
beginning
of
his
campaign
throughout
every
step
with
the
knowledge
that
any
time
he
spends
money
he
is
going
to
be
providing
his
opponent
with
an
advantage;
he
is
going
to
be
enhancing
his
opponent's
speech.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
that
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
making
it
easier
for
a
self-financed
candidate's
opponent
to
respond
to
that
speech.
in
essence,
what
section
319
says
is,
we
are
going
to
make
it
easier
for
your
opponent
to
beat
you.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
yes.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
that
the
government
cannot
take--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--your
honor,
buckley
is
on...
there
is
not
anything--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
can't
concede
that,
and
this
is
the
reason
why.
if
section
319
operates
as
it's
intended
to,
it
will
deter
self-financed
candidates
from
ever
reaching
that
$350,000
threshold
and
triggering
the,
quote
unquote,
"more
speech".
what
it
is
really
designed
to
do
at
every
single
step--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--we
have
very
little
experience
under
the
statute,
justice--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--for
the
2006
campaign?
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
well,
justice
souter,
in
fact
it
did
deter
my
client.
if
you
look
at
his
election
in
its
totality,
his
opponent
spent
over
$5
million.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
absolutely.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
justice
souter,
respectfully,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
categorically
say
that
it
did
not
deter
my
client
when
he
was
outspent
by
$3
million
in
that
campaign.
as
he
went
through
the
campaign
against
his--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--your
honor,
he
actually
did
spend
$2
million.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
potentially.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
your
honor,
if
the
basis
for
the
statute
is
to,
quote
unquote,
$1.4
million
even
though
he
had
already
outspent
my
opponent
by
$3
million.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
there
is,
justice
alito.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
because
his
incumbent
opponent
from
the
last
two
elections
has
announced
his
retirement
and
so
mr.
davis
will
now
be
facing
very
likely
primary
challengers,
and
then
if
he
were
to
prevail
in
the
primary
he'll
be
meeting
a
non-incumbent
challenger
in
the
general
election
as
well.
so
it's
an
open
seat.
and
again,
one
of
the
great
deficiencies
of
319
is
that
it
fails
to
take
into
account
any
of
the
advantages
of
incumbency,
not
just
the
financial
advantages
but
the
inherent
advantage
that
each
and
every
incumbent
brings
to
an
election
when
he
or
she
runs
for
re-election,
the
fact
that
the
incumbent
has
much
greater
status
as--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--first
of
all,
the
statistics
here
are
incomplete
because
basically
the
briefing
in
this
case
was
concluded
in
early
september
of
2006,
before
a
lot
of
primaries
occurred
for
the
2006
house
election.
and
so
i
think
referring
to
those
numbers...
the
fec
has
never...
we've
never
received
any
additional
numbers
for
the
effect,
but--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--the
other
number
that
was
cited
is
that
only
2
of
60
incumbents
actually
triggered
the
millionaires'
amendment
in
those--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--that's
certainly
our
argument,
justice
scalia.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
the...
the
fact
that
the
statute
expands
the
supposedly
anti-corruptive
$2300
to
$6900
and
allows
a
national
party
to
make
coordinated
communications
of
an
unlimited
amount
in
response
to
the,
what
buckley
called
"ameliorative
speech"
by
a
self-financer,
would
also
increase
the
perception
that...
that
our
candidates
are
there
to
be
bought.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
mr.
davis
had
sat
down
and
read
all
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
before
he
decided
to
run,
he
wouldn't
have
seen
a
word
in
there
about
leveling
the
playing
field.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
can
think
of
one
off
the
top
of
my
head
which
is
not
this
case,
and
that's
public
funding.
if
congress
were
truly
concerned
about
providing
a
boost
to
minor
party
candidates
who
may
not
be
able
to
raise
the
$2300
to
begin
with,
much
less
take
advantage
of
the
benefits
of
319,
or
wanted
to
boost
self-financed
candidates
who,
say,
like
mr.
derossett
in
the
amicus
brief,
in
his
amicus
brief,
who
mortgaged
his
house
or
others
who
have
encumbered
their
pensions
and
raised
$350,000
or
$400,000
and
then
triggered
the
amendment,
if
they
wanted
to
foster
all
of
those
people
of
modest
means
to
participate,
then
the
easiest
way
and
the
way
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
buckley
is
to
institute
a
public
funding
system
and
allow
them
to
choose.
they
can
raise
private
funds
if
they'd
like;
they
could
do
it
personally
with
their
own
money;
or
they
could
take
whatever
amount
that
the...
that
the
state
was
willing
to
give
them--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--but
this
court's
analysis
in
buckley...
the
public
funding
analysis
in
buckley
does
not
center
on
leveling
the
playing
field
or
providing
equality
for
all
candidates.
it--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--i--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
and
there's
a
reason
why
there's
a
distinction
between
an
anti-corruptive
purpose
and
a
leveling-the-playing-field
purpose.
when
congress
legislates
to
deal
with
the
actuality
or
appearance
of
corruption,
they
are
legislating
uniformly
and
they're
not
taking
an
interest
in
the
outcome,
in
the
competitiveness.
when
they
are
talking
about
leveling
the
playing
field,
one
of
the
players
on
that
playing
field
are
incumbent
members
of
congress.
it's
like
saying
that
we're
going
to
trust
basketball
players
not...
to
call
their
own
out-of-bounds
plays.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
justice
ginsburg,
in
buckley
there...
there
was
no
lid
on
personal
expenditures.
the
court
struck
down
that
aspect
of
buckley
and
upheld
the
public
funding
provision.
so
the
court
was--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but...
but
again,
if
you're
going
to
make
a
comparison
to
the
public
funding
system
in
buckley
that
was
approved
by
this
court,
that
system
was
indifferent
to
the...
the
source
or
the
amount
of
funds.
all
the
court
said
there...
or
the
equality...
that
that
statute
was
indifferent
to
whether
the
playing
field
was
level.
all...
all
buckley
said
and
all
congress
said
in
enacting
the
public
funding
was
we
want
to
take
the
allegedly
corruptive
private
funds
out
of
the
system,
and
we
want
to
replace
it
with
public
funds
and--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--justice
alito,
leveling
the
playing
field
is...
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
congress
would
start
to
do
that
without
implicating
their
own
interest.
when
you
say
that
you're
going
to
level
the
playing
field,
congress
has
to
look
at
the
whole
playing
field.
they
can't
just
carve
out
a
section
that
applies
to
other
people
and
not
talk
about
their
interest
in
leveling
the
playing
field.
i
think
it's
a
very
difficult
road
to
go
down.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
well,
it's
an
attempt
to
do
that.
and
again,
in
buckley
this
court
said
that...
that
congress
has
no
interest
in
determining
whether
speech
is
excessive
or
unwise
or
wasteful.
that's...
that's
ultimately
the
purview
for
the
voters,
and
that's
really
the
fallacy
in
319
at
its
heart,
is
there's
no
such
thing
as
secret
self-funders.
they
will...
everything
that
they
do
is
disclosed
in
the
same
way
that
all
other
expenditures
and
contributions
are
disclosed
in
quarterly
and
pre-election
reports.
certainly,
in
many
cases,
their
opponents
are
going
to
make
the
case
that
this
wealthy
person
is
out
of
touch,
they
don't
represent
the
district,
your
vote
is
not
to
be
bought.
and
then
ultimately
the
voters
will
have
the
determination
on
what
kind
of
candidate
they
want.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
it
certainly
is
in
this
area
and
in
many
congressional
districts
in
the
united
states.
and
that's
a
very
good
point,
justice
scalia.
this
provision
affects
less...
about
a
quarter
of
what
it
costs
to
run
a
competitive
race
in
2006.
so
certainly
it's
not
as
if
congress
said,
well,
if
you
spend
some
disproportionate
amount
of
money
to
a
congressional
race,
if
you
go
ten
times
over
what
it
should
cost,
we're
going
to
step
in.
they
said--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--i
think
it
would
be
equally
unconstitutional,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
if
you're
talking
about
the
tailoring
of
the
statute,
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
something
that's
relevant.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
tom
reynolds.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
he
can
receive
up
to
100
14
percent
of
whatever
that
opfa
number
is...
the--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--the
purported
difference
in
funds.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy?
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
well,
again,
your
honor,
if
you're
making
a
distinction...
when
you
talk
about
the--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--well,
the
statute
talks
about
the
less
wealthy
candidate.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
the
best
argument,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
money
and
speech
are
synonymous
in
an
electoral
context,
and
it's
inappropriate
for
the
government
to
say
that
you,
as
the
purportedly
wealthier
candidate,
have
too
much
speech;
that
that's
enough
speech
from
you.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
well--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--i--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
of
course,
the
party
would
have
to
make
a
determination
if
they
felt
that
this
person
was--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--well,
justice
kennedy,
if
you
refer
to
colorado
ii,
where
this
court
talked
about
the
facts
that...
where
this
court
upheld
limitations
on
party,
unlimited
party-coordinated
communications,
because
that...
allowing
the
party
to
do
so
would
raise
the
possibility
of
evading
the
contribution
limits.
and
so
accordingly
they
upheld
the
42...
the
$42,000
limit
on
coordinated
communication.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
it
is
less
violative
of
the
first
amendment,
but,
again,
this
court
has
made
the
distinction
between
contribution
limits,
which
it
found
was
a
reasonable
burden
on
the
constitution,
and
expenditure
limits,
which...
which
are
not.
this--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--it
does
not
limit
the
restrictions.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
that
is,
that
is
correct.
but--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--he
is...
my
candidate,
my
client,
is
subject
to
restrictions.
the
statute
in
its
entirety--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--absolutely
not,
justice
stevens.
but
for
many...
for
many
self-financed
candidates,
the
fact
that--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--the
contribution
limits
apply
to
him
as
they
would
to
any
other
candidate
except
for
his
opponent.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
he
cannot
have
the
same
level
of
support.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
of
course,
it
can
be
vital
in
an
election,
and
it
can
be
vital
for
a
candidate
who
may
be
a
candidate
of
modest
means.
that
would
be
certainly
one
way
for
them
to
generate
support.
did
he
convince
their
party
that
they
were
worthy
of
that
support?
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
not...
only
as
determined
by
the
party's
decision
as
to
how
they
feel
about
the
candidate's
positions.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
they
certainly
have
that
opportunity,
but
under...
under
a
limit,
under
the
$42,000
limit,
as
opposed
to
essentially
an
infinite
limit
when
you're
dealing
with
a
self-funded
candidate.
and
incidentally,
justice
stevens,
to
address
something
else
that
you
just
brought
up,
for
many
self-financed
candidates
the
fact
that
they
don't
take
money
from
their
party
or
from
donors
or
from
pacs
is
a
significant
issue
for
them
in
their
campaign.
i
mean
certainly
for
mr.
davis,
the
fact
that
he
is
independent
and
can
make
his
own
determinations--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--he
is
the
ultimate
independent.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
you
cannot
corrupt
yourself.
and,
again,
the
voters
will
get
to
decide
whether
they
want
someone
who
is
like
that
or
they
want
someone
who
is
more
in
tune
with,
say,
what
the
party
wants
or
with
what
his
donors
want.
i
mean,
that's
really
the
essence
of
our...
of
our
electoral
system.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
mr.
chief
justice,
they
are
interested
in
those
candidates
only
inasmuch
as
they
get
elected.
the
moment
that
the
public
turns
on
them,
they
won't
be
interested.
and
certainly
the
public
was
not
particularly
interested
in
mitt
romney,
who
spent
a
significant
amount
of
money
on
his
own
behalf,
and
many
other
spectacular
flameouts.
[laughter]
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
i
apologize.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
let
me
just
add...
let
me
just
add
one
other
thing.
the
government's
own
experts,
all
of
their
information
is
derived
from
an
individual
who
is
quoted
as
saying
that
self-financed
candidates
rarely
win,
and
when
they
do,
it's
usually
for
some
other
reason.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they
don't
always
make
great
candidates
because
they're
not
within
the
mainstream.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
let
me
answer
this...
the
discussion
about
the
quote
"parity
principle".
in
this
case,
mr.
davis
was
outspent
by
$3
million,
yet
the
parity
principle
would
have
allowed
his
opponent
to
raise
another
$1.4
million.
the
district
court
has
never
answered...
never
answered
that
flaw
in
the
statute.
i
haven't
seen
any
explanation
of
how
that
creates
parity
when
the
higher
fund--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--for
his
opponent?
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
he
went
into
the
election,
justice
ginsburg,
with
about
a
$1.15
million
war
chest.
and
then
he--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--he
was
a
chairman
of
the
nrcc.
he
was
an
excellent
fundraiser.
[laughter]
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
i
would
agree
with...
with
my
friend
that
we
have
no
interest
in
leveling
up.
that's...
that's...
as
an
independent
candidate,
mr.
davis
is
forgoing,
for
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
his
funding,
contributions
from
private
sources,
and
he
has
no
interest
in
fostering
higher
contribution
limits
for
anyone.
let
me
also
discuss
the
intent...
excuse
me...
the
disclosure
very
briefly.
there
has
been
some
discussion
about
how
this
is...
it's
very
similar
to
independent-expenditure
disclosure.
it's
really
not.
what
the...
what
the
statute
requires
is
that
a
self-financed
candidate
declare,
at
the
very
start
of
his
campaign,
whether
he
intends
to
spend
more
than
$350,000.
that,
as
the
government's
brief
acknowledges,
has
no
analogue
in
any
other
disclosure
provision,
and
it
serves...
it
serves
no
purpose.
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
inform
the
electorate
of
anything
other
than
that
this
gentleman
is
going
to
be
self-financing.
it
certainly
doesn't
address
corruption.
it's
simply...
simply
harassment
of
a
self-financer
requiring
them
to
go
on
the
record--
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
andrew
d.
herman
certainly.
and
then,
finally,
there
is
a
reference
to
this...
this
is
the
ultimate
soft
money.
we
would
submit
this
is
the
ultimate
hard
money.
this
is
money
that
was
raised
by
mr.
davis.
he
earned
it.
he
is
entitled
to
spend
it
as
he
wishes,
and
he
is
certainly
entitled
to
spend
it
furthering
his
candidacy.
now,
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
