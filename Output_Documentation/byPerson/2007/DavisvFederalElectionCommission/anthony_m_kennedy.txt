i'd
like
to
ask
about
the
provisions
of
the
statute
which
allow
the
candidate
who
doesn't
have
the
personal
funds...
what
was
the
name
of
the
challenger
in
this
case?
not
davis...
reynolds?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
reynolds...
to
receive,
is
it,
unlimited
contributions
from
his
own
party?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
had
a
statute
which
either
explicitly
said
or
has
the
effect,
as
this
does,
that
the
less
wealthy
challenger,
the
challenger
in
reynolds'
position,
has
more
access
and
more
support
from
his
party
than
the
challenger
does
from
his
party?
what
is
your
best
case
that
indicates
that
that
is
unconstitutional,
and
what
is
your
argument
that
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
concerns
me
in
this.
what
is
your
best
argument
that
differential
treatment
of
the
candidates
vis-a-vis
support
from
their
respective
parties
is
unconstitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
statute
makes
that
distinction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
distinction
is
somewhat
questionable,
and
i'm
asking
you
for
your
best
statement
of
the
theory
as
to
why
it's
unconstitutional
and
your
best
case
to
show
that
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
make
that
argument
to
the
statute
generally.
is
there
any
more
specific
argument
that
you
can
make
in
the
context
of
the
less
well-funded
candidate
having
more
support
from
the
party
than
the
well-funded
candidate
had?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
particular
vice
of
the
statute,
and
i
want
to
know
if
there
is
a
formulation
that's
more
precise
than
the
general
attack
that
you
made...
that
you
make.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
party
for
the
less
well-funded
candidate
has
the
option
to
have
much
closer
ties,
much
greater
involvement,
than
the
party
for
the
other
candidate;
and
that
seems
to
me
highly
problematic.
and
i
want
to
know
the
best
case
that
you
have
for
that
proposition
and
the
best
statement
of
law
that
can
you
give
me
for
why
that
is
unconstitutional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
he
cannot
have
the
support
from
his
party
that
the
opponent
can
have
from
the
opponent's
party.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
the
same
level
of
support.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
party
support
sometimes
important
in
an
election?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
anything
in
colorado
indicate
that
there
can
be
a
differential
between
the
party
support
given
to
one
candidate
and
the
party
support
given
to
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
just
money.
it's
the
quality
and
kind
of
speech.
you're
saying,
the
government
is
saying,
the
statute
says,
that
the
underfunded
candidate
has
less
access
to
coordinated
expenditures
with
the
party
than...
than
the
other
party...
than
the
other
candidate.
and
the
cases
have
acknowledge,
the
statute
acknowledges,
that
coordinated
expenditures
have
a
particularly
potent
force,
and
you
are
saying
candidates
are
treated
differently
in
the
access
to
this
kind
of
speech.
and
i
know
of
no
precedent
of
this
court
that
says
one
party
is
entitled
to
assistance
from
a
certain
segment
and
another
party
is
not,
based
on
the...
the
content
of
the
speech.
and
that's
exactly
what
this
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
in
the
statute
and
it's
part
of
the
challenge.
i
agree
that
it's
been
given
a
relatively
minor
position,
but
it's
of
great
concern
to
me
because
it
puts
this
court,
it
puts
this
statute,
in
the
position
of
preferring
one
kind
of
speech
over
another.
and
we
simply
do
not
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
argument
is
not
properly
before
us
when
we
are
judging
the
validity
of
the
statute
that's
been
challenged?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
provisions--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
provisions
of
the
law
which
prefers
one
candidate
over
the
other
with
respect
to
coordinated
expenditures
has
an
impact
on
campaign
strategy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
solicitor
general,
you're
defending
this
statute
on
its
face,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
facial
invalidity
of
substantial
proportions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
which
says
that
independently
wealthy
candidates
generally
have
different
sorts
of
views
than
other
people?
