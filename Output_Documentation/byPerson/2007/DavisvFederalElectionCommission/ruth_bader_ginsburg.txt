justice
ruth
bader

how
is
the
government
speaking?
you
have
already
acknowledged
that
the
wealthy
candidate
can
spend
as
much
as
he
or
she
wants
and
the
end
result
of
this
scheme
is
that
there
will
be
more,
not
less,
speech
because
the
non-affluent
opponent
will
now
have
money
to
spend
that
he
didn't
have
before.
so
i
think
you
have
to
concede
that
overall
the
scheme
will
produce
more
political
speech,
not
less.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
done
it?
i
mean,
we
do
have
some
experience
under
the
statute
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
a
four-year
record
and
the
numbers
are
rather
startling
that...
is
it
110
senators
or
representatives
qualified
for
the
enhanced
contributions
and
only
6
of
them
were
incumbents?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
that's
so,
one
of
the
reasons
that
has
been
given
for
this
statute
is
that
it
encourages
the
parties
to
favor
the
wealthier
candidates;
it
deters
people
who
are
non-affluent
but
highly
meritorious.
so...
and
it
gives
the
public
the
perception
that
the
seats
in
our
congress
are
there
to
be
bought
by
the
wealthiest
bidder.
and
if
there's
anything
to
that...
well,
do
you
reject
that
out
of
hand
as
what
the
statute
is
all
about?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought...
i
thought
your
brief...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
said
at
one
stage
that
there
is...
what
congress
was
driving
at
is
a
valid
concern,
but
there
are
less
restrictive
alternatives.
and
i
was
trying
to
find
what
those
less
restrictive
alternatives
were.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
there
something
different
between
what
the
statute
was
at
the
time
of
buckley,
that
a
lid
on,
you
can't
spend
more
than
x
amount
of
money,
and
a
statute
that
says
we're
going
to
let
you
spend,
the
sky
is
the
limit
for
you,
but
we're
going
to
give
a
boost
to
your
opponent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
the
statute
as
it
was
originally
enacted
by
congress
did
have
expenditure
limits
and
this
court
said
that
was
no
good.
this
statute
doesn't
have
that
problem
because
it
doesn't
put
a
lid
on
the
candidates
self-financing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
clarify
with
respect
to
that
question
two
things:
the
party
is
not
at
liberty
to
give
anything
it
wants.
you
explained
that
it
would
be...
it's
tied
to
that
formula.
so
the
wealthy
person
could
still
have
a
lot
more
to
spend.
but
the
party
also
is...
there's
no
obligation
of
the
party
to
give
one
cent
to
anybody
that
it
doesn't
choose
to
give
money
to;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
problem
is
it's
every
$10,000.
as
you
pointed
out,
it
doesn't
require
more
disclosure.
all
of
this
information
would
be
disclosed
under
the
system
without
this
24-hour,
and
that
i
think
is
the
complaint,
the
burden
of
having
every
time
you
spend
$10,000
to
file
something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
i
thought
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
justice
breyer's
question,
general
clement,
was
he
asked
you
to
assume
that
that
was
unconstitutional,
and
you
were
answering
if
it
was
unconstitutional.
but
there
is
one
person
whose
speech
is
being
discouraged
in
the
picture,
and
that's
the
contributor
to
the
self-financed
candidate.
you
have
to
recognize
that
that
one
can't
speak
as
much
vis-a-vis
the
contributors
to
the
other
candidate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
the
money
come
from?
was
it
a
war
chest
left
over
from
prior
campaigns?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
because
he
didn't...
his
opponent
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
relaxed
contribution
limits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
he
was
just
a
good
fundraiser?
that--
