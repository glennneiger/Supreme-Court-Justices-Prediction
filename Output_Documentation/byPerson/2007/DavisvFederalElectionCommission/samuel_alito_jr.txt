justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
this
statute
will
have
any
greater
or
different
effect
of
mr.
davis
in
the
upcoming
election
than
it
did
in
the
last
election?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
if...
even
if
leveling
the
playing
field
is
not
generally
a
compelling
or
maybe
even
a
permissible
interest,
is
it
a
stronger
interest
when
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
playing
field
is
not
level
is
other
action
that
congress
has
taken?
if
there
weren't
expenditure
limits,
then
self-financed
candidates
wouldn't
perhaps
have
as
much
of
an
advantage
as
they
do.
so
if
we
accept
the
world
in
which
contribution
limits
are
constitutional,
it...
does
that
provide
a
basis
for
congress
to
try
to
rectify
at
least
in
part
what
it
itself
has
done
by
imposing
the
contribution
limits?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
isn't
there
something
very...
isn't
there
something
very
strange
about
having
different
contribution
limits
for
candidates
in
an
election?
do
you
think
it
would
be
constitutional
for
congress
to
say
that
the...
the
contribution
limits
for
incumbents
is
x,
but
for
challengers
it's
2x
or
one-half
x?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
is
it
that
there
is
a
serious
corruption
problem
in
most
instances
if
a
contributor
gives
more
than
$2,300
to
a
candidate,
but
there
is
no
serious...
presumably
congress
doesn't
think
there
is
a
serious
corruption
problem
when
this
statute
kicks
in
and
somebody
gives
$6,900
to
a
candidate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
there
a
difference,
because
it
may
take...
it
may
take
more
money
to
campaign
for
a
particular
office,
and
so
the...
it
might
take
a
greater
amount
to
have
a
corrupting
influence
on...
on
that
particular
race
than
on
a
race
where
the
total
amount
spent
is...
is
lower.
but
here
you're
not
talking
about
different
offices.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
it
applies
different
limits
to
different
in
the
same...
to
candidates
in
the
same
race.
so
why
would
mr.
davis
be
subject
to
potential
corruption
if
he
got
2,300...
$2,301
from
a...
from
a
contributor,
but
his
opponent
in
exactly
the
same
race
would
not
be
exposed
to
corruption
if
he
got
$6,900?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
you
address
justice
scalia's
question
about
leveling
up
and
leveling
down?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
federal
campaign
finance
law
limits
the
contributions
to
candidates
for
the
house
of
representatives
may
receive
from
individuals
and
political
parties.
these
limits
generally
apply
equally
to
all
candidates.
however,
section
319
of
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act
of
2002,
part
of
the
so-called,
“millionaires
amendment,”
departs
from
this
general
rule.
when
a
self-financing
candidate
spends
more
than
$350,000
of
personal
funds
and
certain
other
conditions
are
met.
section
319(a)
expands
the
normal
contribution
limits
but
only
for
the
candidate's
non-self-financing
opponent.
to
make
it
possible
to
tell
when
this
--
a
symmetrical
regime
applies,
section
319(b)
requires
the
self-financing
candidate
to
disclose
certain
information
about
his
or
her
personal
campaign
expenditures.
appellant
jack
davis,
a
candidate
for
the
house
in
2004
and
2006
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
sections
319(a)
and
(b).
a
three-judge
panel
with
the
district
court
concluded
that
davis
had
standing
but
rejected
his
challenge
on
the
merits,
and
davis
appealed
to
this
court.
we
agree
that
davis
possesses
spending
and
that
his
claims
are
not
moved.
however,
we
conclude
that
sections
319(a)
and
(b)
violate
the
first
amendment
and
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
if
section
319(a)'s
expanded
contribution
limits
were
available
to
both
self-financing
and
non-self-financing
candidates,
davis
would
have
no
constitutional
claim.
by
expanding
contribution
limits
only
for
non-self-financing
candidates
however,
section
319
(a)
burdens
the
self-financing
candidate's
right
in
the
words
of
buckley
versus
valeo
to
spend
personal
funds
to,
"vigorously
and
tirelessly
advocate
his
own
election."
section
319(a)
does
this
because
if
a
candidate
vigorously
exercises
the
right
to
use
personal
funds
for
campaign
speech
that
candidate's
opponent
obtains
substantial
and
unprecedented
fund
raising
advantages.
this
burden
is
not
justified
by
any
compelling
state
interest.
reliance
on
personal
funds
rather
than
campaign
contributions
reduces,
rather
than
increases
the
threat
of
corruption
and
perception
of
corruption.
and
we
have
never
recognized
the
interest
that
the
government
has
asserted
in
defending
the
constitutionality
of
this
provision,
that
is
an
interest
in
leveling
electoral
opportunities
as
a
legitimate
government
interest.
endorsing
that
interest
would
have
ominous
implications
for
voter's
authority
to
evaluate
the
strengths
of
candidates
for
public
office.
because
section
319(a)'s
asymmetrical
contribution
regime
imposes
a
significant
burden
on
first
amendment
rights
that
is
not
justified
by
a
compelling
state
interest
that
cannot
withstand
first
amendment
scrutiny.
and
because
section
319(b)'s
disclosure
requirements
exist
merely
to
implement
section
319(a)'s
unconstitutional
regime
to
burden
those
requirements,
imposes
likewise
unwarranted.
