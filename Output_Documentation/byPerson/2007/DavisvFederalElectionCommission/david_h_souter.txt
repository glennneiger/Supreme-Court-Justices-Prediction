justice
david
h.
souter
well
your
clients...
wasn't
your
client's
latest
filing
that
he
intended
to
spend
a
million
dollars.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
it
didn't
deter
him.
you're
in
the
position
in
which
it
clearly
didn't
deter
your
client.
he
says,
i'm
going
to
spend
three
times
as
much
as
the
threshold
figure,
and
there
is
no
empirical
evidence
that
it's
deterring
anybody
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
we
expect
a
chill
argument
to
at
least
have
a
ring
of
plausibility?
and
your
chill
argument
is
that
it
is
deterring.
it
didn't
deter
your
client.
there
is
no
indication
that
it
would
deter
anybody
else
and
i
have
to
say
i
don't
see
why
it
would.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
if
the...
if
the
other
side
had
not
had
an
enhanced
spending
capacity,
your
client
would
then
have
spent
$2
million?
justice
david
h.
souter
whatever
it
is,
i
mean
are
you
saying
that
if
the...
if
the
client...
if
the
opposing
party
had
not
had
an
enhanced
spending
capacity
your
client
would
have
spent
even
more?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
seems
to
substantiate
the,
at
least
the
ostensible
basis
for
this
statute.
