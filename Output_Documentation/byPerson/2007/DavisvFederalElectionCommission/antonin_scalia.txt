mr.
herman,
can
the
government
respond
to
political
speech?
the
government
can
have
a
position
on
smoking
cigarettes,
it
can
have
a
position
on
a
lot
of
things,
but
can
it
have
a
position
on
whether
the
republican
party
or
the
democratic
party
should
win
the
next
election?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
distinction
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
usually
evaluate
restrictions
on
first
amendment
rights
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
chill
that
was
imposed
by
the
government
was
actually
effective
in
stifling
the
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
person
goes
ahead
and
speaks
anyway,
is
he
estopped
from
saying
that
the
government
was
chilling
his
speech
nonetheless?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that's
what's
going
on
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
says
that
in
fact
more
and
quite
a
bit
more
incumbents
went
over
the
$350,000
personal
funding
limits
than
non-incumbents.
something
like...
i
don't
know,
14-2
or
something
like
that
in
the
last
election,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that
could
mean
that
the
millionaires
have
already
been
elected
and
are
now
pulling
up
the
ladder
after
them.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
wouldn't
level
the
playing
field.
i
mean,
the
other
side,
the
millionaire,
won't
take
the
public
funding
and
he'll
spend
his
millions
and
whoever
gets
the
public
funding...
or
are
you
saying
the
public
funding
should
match
whatever
the
other
side
pays?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
think
that's
a
valid
constitutional
objective,
to
level
the
playing
field?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
we
should
trust
our
incumbent
senators
and
representatives
to
level
the
playing
field
for
us?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
we're
talking
about
in
leveling
the
playing
field,
i
guess,
is
leveling
the
amount
of
speech
that
each
side
has,
to
make
sure
that
each
side
has
the
same
amount
of
speech.
is
that...
is
that
what's
going
on
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
we...
are
we
talking
wealthy
people
here?
what's
the
average
price
of
a
home
in
the
united
states?
i
think
it's
a
good
deal
above
$350,000,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
limit
those
restrictions
on
your
candidate.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
simply
makes
the
imposition
of
the
restrictions
uneven.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it
prohibit...
i
thought
it
prohibited
him
from
raising
funds
in
the
amount
from
as
wealthy
donors
as
his
opponent
can
now
go
to?
don't
those
limits
on
contributions
continue
to
apply
to
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
is
more
incorruptible
than
the
millionaire,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ultimate
incorruptible.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
penalized
his
own
spending.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
means
he
is
willing
to
accept
the
penalty
in
the
next
election
even
if
this
case
doesn't
come
out
in
his
favor.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
prove
that
it
isn't
a
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
really
a
proper
function
of
government,
to
look
out
over
there
and
say,
we're
going
to
even
the
playing
field
in
this
election?
what
if
some...
one
candidate
is
more
eloquent
than
the
other
one?
you
make
him
talk
with
pebbles
in
his
mouth
or
what?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
campaign
finance
regimes
we've
approved
up
to
now,
the
significant
limitations,
have
had
an
anti-corruption
rationale.
there
is
no
anti-corruption
rationale
here.
the
only
purpose
of
this
is
to
level
the
playing
field.
and
i
am
deeply
suspicious
of
allowing
elections
to
be
conducted
under
a
regime
whereby
congress
levels
the
playing
field.
that
seems
to
be
very
dangerous.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
that's
what
a
facial
challenge
essentially
consists
of.
you
don't
look
to
see
whether
in
fact
the
harmful
first
amendment
effect
has
occurred;
you
look
to
whether
it
opens
up
the
possibility
for
that
to
occur.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
go
in
before
the
election
and
say:
look,
i'm
about
to
be
terribly
disadvantaged;
my
opponent
is
about
to
have
all
of
these
coordinated
expenses
and
i'm
not
able
to.
and
you're
going
to
say:
oh,
we
have
to
wait
until
the
election
is
over
to
see
whether
in
fact
that
happens.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
a
situation
a
facial
challenge
is
designed
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
one
party
has
more
time
on
his
hands?
he's...
he's
unemployed,
so
he...
you
know,
he
can
go
around,
whereas
the
other
party
has
to...
has
to
hire
people
to
speak
for
him.
he
has...
he
has
a
job
most
of
the
time.
are
you
going
to
even
that
disparity,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
understand
leveling,
leveling
contribution
limits
when
you're
worried
about
corruption,
i
can
understand
that.
but
doing
it
just
to...
to
make
sure
that
there
is
an
even
playing
field,
i...
there's
just
no
end
to
that.
and
it
just
isn't
money
that
makes
it
an
even
playing
feed.
a
lot
of
other
factors...
incumbency,
the
war
chest
that
incumbents
have
which...
money
from
the
last
election,
that
isn't
counted
for...
for
the
millionaires'
provision.
there
are
so
many
factors
that...
that
go
to
making
the
even
playing
field
that
i...
i'm
just
very
reluctant
to
acknowledge
a
congressional
power
to...
to
sit
in
judgment
of
our
elections
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
price
of
accepting
the
government
subsidy.
they're...
nobody
is
accepting
a
government
subsidy
here.
the
man
is
spending
his
own
money--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
a
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
theory
that
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
anyway?
is
that
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
can
chop
it
up
this
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
we
found...
we
were
of
the
view
that
all
of
the
provisions,
that
the
benefits
given
to
the
other
side
here
are
bad.
i
suppose
we
could
even...
re-even
the
playing
field
by
either
denying
those
benefits
to
the
candidate
opposing
the
appellant,
the
petitioner
here,
or
we
could
do
the
opposite
and
eliminate
similar
restrictions
upon...
upon
the
petitioner.
do
you
have
any
idea
which
way
we
ought
to
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
advises
the
other
side
that
they
should
get
ready
to
raise
more
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
i
mean
if
you
say
all
of
the
rest
of
the
statute
is
okay,
that's
certainly
reasonable.
if
you're
going
to
let
the
guy
go
above
the
limits
that
would
otherwise
apply,
it's
useful
to
let
him
know
in
advance
so
he
can
start,
you
know,
beating
the
bushes,
right?
