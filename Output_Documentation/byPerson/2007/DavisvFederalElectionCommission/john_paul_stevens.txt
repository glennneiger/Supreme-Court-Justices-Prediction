justice
john
paul
stevens
why
can't
he
go
out
and
raise
funds?
does
the
statute
prohibit
him
from
raising
funds
from
third
parties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they
certainly
can
allocate
funds
more
generously
to
one
candidate
than
another;
can't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
one
of
the
virtues
of
the
independent
self-financed
candidate
is
he
can
emphasize
his
independence?
so
he
very
rarely
is
going
to
complain
about
not
being
able
to
get
too
much
money,
enough
money
from
outside
sources.
and
isn't
it
a
fact
that
most
of
them
do
finance
a
very
significant
24
percentage
of
their
total
campaign
costs?
