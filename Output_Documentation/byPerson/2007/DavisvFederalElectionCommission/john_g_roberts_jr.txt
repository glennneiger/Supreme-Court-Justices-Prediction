chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-320,
davis
v.
the
federal
election
commission.
mr.
herman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
no
restriction
whatsoever
on
the
wealthier
candidate.
he
can
spend
as
much
of
his
money
as
he
wants.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if,
for
example,
somebody
takes
out
a
television
ad
that
says
smoking
this
type
of
cigarette
is
actually,
is
not
harmful
to
you.
the
government
is
free
to
take
out
a
contrary
ad
saying,
no,
it
is
and
so
you
shouldn't
do
it,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
governmental
responses
to
the
exercise
of
free
speech
are
not
automatically...
don't
automatically
burden
the
exercise
of
that
speech.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
why
does
it
burden
it
for
the
government
to
make
it
easier
for
private
citizens
to
respond
to
that
speech.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
case
supports
that
proposition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
government
can't
engage
in
political
speech.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
think
that
would
be
any
more
constitutional
than
this,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
said
earlier
that
money
is...
money
is
speech
in
this
area.
so
i
take
it
you
think
that
the
restrictions,
otherwise
applicable
restrictions
on
the
less
wealthy
candidate,
raise
problems
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
law
eases
those
problematic
restrictions.
it's
less
violative
of
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
your
candidate
isn't
subject
to
any
restriction
at
all
on
what
he
can
spend
and
his
opponent
is
subject
to
less
restrictions.
it
seems
to
me
the
first
amendment
comes
out
better.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think...
i
mean,
obviously
you're
correct
that
this
system
benefits
incumbents,
but
it
benefits
your
client
in
a
particular
way
as
well.
the
parties
are
certainly
interested
in
candidates
who
will
fund
themselves
because
that
presents
less
strain
on
the
party's
resources.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
we
need
characterizations
of
the
political
candidates...--
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
this
forum.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
herman.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general,
we
haven't
talked
yet
about
the
disclosure,
the
special
disclosure
requirements
in
that
money
is
speech,
and
in
a
first
amendment
area
it
strikes
me
as
very
problematic
that
the
government
requires
you
to
disclose
in
a
differential
way
how
you
intend...
when
you're
spending
a
particular
amount
of
money
and
on
such
precise
day-by-day
requirements.
i
mean,
is
there
any
other
area...
if
you're
writing
a
book,
you
don't
have
to
disclose
to
the
government
when
you're
going
to
publish
it
and
how
far
along
you're
getting
in
the
draft.
and
yet,
it
just
seems
this
is
the
same
sort
of
thing
in
the
election
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
those
are
applicable
across
the
board.
these
are
special
disclosure
requirements
for
people
who
are
going
to
engage
in
additional
speech.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
wouldn't
you
think
they
would
require
more
detailed
and
more
expeditious
disclosure
of
the
associational
link
than
of
the
self-funding?
and
yet
it's
the
exact
opposite?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the...
what
if
the
restriction
were
more
tailored,
if
congress
decided
the
one
area
where
the
wealthy
really
have
an
advantage
is
buying
television
time,
so
that's
what
we're
going
to
restrict.
if
the
wealthy
individual
buys
a
certain
amount
of
television
time,
we're
going
to
allow
contributions
to
the
less
wealthy
candidate
to
buy
television
time.
they
think
the
money
is
not
as
big
a
deal
in
the
other
areas.
would
that
be
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
congress
decided
that
a
debate
on
a
particular
issue
was
distorted
by
the
wealth
of
owners
of
newspapers?
and
so
it
passed
a
law
saying
that
people
who
are
responding
to
that
are
relieved
of
the
tax
burden
they
would
otherwise
have
to
pay,
on
whatever
their...
you
know,
sales
tax
on
pamphlets
that
they
want
to
sell.
would
that
be
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
level
the
playing
field
on
the
debate
on
that
particular
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no...
so
you
can
tax...
you
can
tax
a
newspaper,
but
you
cannot...
you
don't
have
to
tax
people
who
are
responding
to
the
newspaper?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
taxing
power
is
an...
is
a
limit
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
any...
any
organization
that
engaged
in
lobbying.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
there
no
limitation
on
the
rationale
of
leveling
the
playing
field
throughout
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
trying...
it's
certainly
trying
to
chill
self-financing
by
burdening
it
when
it
reaches
a
certain
level.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
law
expressed
a
displeasure
at
the
introduction
of
self-financing
and
said
that,
as
you
have
these
very
rapid
disclosures,
that
the
less
wealthy
candidate
can
accept
contributions
whatever,
twice
the
amount
of
whatever
the
self-financed
candidate
is
spending
on
his
campaign?
is
that
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he...
you
know,
the
millionaire,
as
we
are
talking
about,
spends...
discloses
that
he
has
spent
$500,000.
then
the
contribution
limits
are
off
the
table
for
the
less
wealthy
candidate
to
the
tune
of
a
million
dollars,
in
other
words
twice
as
much
as
the
self-financed
candidate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
not?
because
as...
your
point
in
this
case,
rather
than
the
hypothetical,
is
that
the
self-financed
candidate
is
not
burdened
in
any
way,
but
simply
that
his
opponent
has
benefited.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
true
in
the
case
of
my
hypothetical
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
all
the
arguments
that
you
gave
before,
like
the
self-financed
candidate
wants
to
be
able
to
say
he
doesn't
rely
on
contributions
and
so
on,
those
would
still
be
equally
applicable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a
qualitative
argument
you're
making
but
a
quantitative.
at
some
point,
the
benefit
to
the
opponent
gets
to
be
too
much
of
a
chill
on
the
self-financed
candidate,
but
under
this
system
you
think
it's
below
the
line.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
mr.
herman,
you
may
take
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
herman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
in
case
07-320,
davis
versus
federal
election
commission.
