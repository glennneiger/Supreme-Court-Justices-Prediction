mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
appellant's
claim
here
is
an
odd
sort
of
first
amendment
complaint.
he
does
not
suggest
that
section
319
has
limited
his
own
spending
at
all.
in
fact,
he
has
twice
spent
a
substantial
amount
of
his
own
money
in
excess
of
the
statutory
triggers.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well...
and
we
can
talk
about
that
as
well,
but
i
think
it's
worth
recognizing
that
his
own
spending
is
unlimited
both
in
theory
and
in
fact.
and,
if
anything,
he
has
announced
his
intent
this
next
time
around
to
spend
even
more
of
his
own
money.
and
the
other
thing
that
i
think
is
relevant
is
his
experience
is
not
atypical
in
this
regard.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
think
in
any
way
it's
a
penalty.
and
i
think
in
order
to
understand
it
as
a
penalty
you
have
to
accept
the
proposition
that
you
start
out
with
a
constitutional
entitlement
to
speak
freely
without
the
opportunity
for
the
other
side
to
respond,
and
i
don't
think
the
constitution
recognizes
this.
this
isn't
a
context
where
they
forced
the
appellant
to
pay
for
the
other
side's
speech,
as
in
tornillo,
or
carry
the
speech,
as
in
pg&e.
and
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
look
at
the
record
here
and
suggest
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here
was
actually
limit
or
deter
self-financing.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
2x
would
be
constitutional.
and
i
think
most
people
would
be
surprised
if
congress
passed
the
statute
that
gave
more
generous
contribution
limits
to
challengers,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
perfectly
appropriate
regime
because
it
would
recognize
that
incumbents
have
certainly
built-in
advantages
such
that
the
relatively
low
hard
money
contribution
caps
have
a
greater
influence,
greater
impact
on
a--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
scalia,
i
think
there's
an
important
distinction
that
was
suggested
in
one
of
justice
alito's
question,
between
the
government
trying
to
level
the
playing
field
in
the
abstract
and
the
government
looking
out,
not
at
the
eloquence
of
candidates,
but
at
its
own
campaign
finance
regime
after
this
court's
decision
and
recognizing
that,
look,
the
differential--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
again,
justice
scalia,
though,
you
start
with
the
anti-corruption
rationale
that
underlies
the
hard
money
contribution
caps.
and
what
congress
has
recognized
is
that
after
buckley
and
after
this
court
said
that
a
candidate's
ability
to
self-finance
is
unlimited,
it's
recognized
that
in
a
subset
of
elections
where
somebody
is
going
to
spend
an
awful
lot
of
their
own
money
to
self-finance,
the
ordinary
hard
money
contribution
caps
are
going
to
have
a
potentially
skewing
effect.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
what
i
would
say
is,
if
you
analogize
to
a
system
where
congress
decided
that
because
of
the
advantage
that
incumbents
have,
there
is
a
greater
scope
for
coordination
of
the
party
with
the
challengers,
i
would
certainly
be
here
defending
that
statute.
i
would
like
to
make
clear,
though,
justice
kennedy,
in
fairness,
that
this
focus
on
the
coordinated
expenditures
of
the
parties
has
really
not
been
the
focus
of
appellant's
challenge
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
let
me
say
two
things
about
the
fact
that
this
was
not
the
gravamen
of
the
challenge
here,
because
one
reason
i
think
that's
clear
is
if
you
look
at
the
record
here,
at
the
point
that
the
record
closed
in
this
case
no
party
had
taken
advantage
of
that
coordinated
expenditures
provision.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
saying
that
this
record
would
not
allow
you
to
invalidate
the
statute
on
that
ground.
the
record
at
the
time
that
it
closed
should...
there
was
no
time
that
a
party
had
taken
advantage
of
that.
now,
i
understand
that
it's
outside
the
record,
but
i
understand
after
the
record
closed
there
were
some
coordinated
expenditures.
but
another
thing
i
would
certainly
want
to
know
before
i
considered
that
challenge,
justice
kennedy,
is
whether
this
particular
appellant
had
coordinated
expenditures
from
his
own
party
up
to
the
limit,
because
we
know
as
a
general
matter
that
there
is...
parties
will
fund
different
candidates
differently
or
may
fund--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--some
and
not
others.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again,
justice
kennedy,
in
fairness,
though,
i
mean,
one
would
expect
if
that
were
the
nature
of
the
claim,
that
at
a
minimum
we
would
know
two
facts
that
i
don't
know,
aren't
in
the
record.
one
is
whether
or
not
his
candidate
reached
the
cap
from
his
party's
coordinated
expenditures,
because
if
he
didn't
i
don't
see
why
that
individual
would
have
standing.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
am
defending--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
always
thought
it
was
harder
to
bring
a
facial
challenge,
not
easier
to
bring
a
facial
challenge.
and
i
realized
that
we
relaxed
the
normal
rules
about
as-applied
challenges
in
the
first
amendment
context,
but
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
limit
to
that,
too.
and
i
think
in
a
case
where
we
don't
know
the
fundamental
facts
that
at
least
i'd
want
to
know
before
even
evaluating
that
challenge,
i
think
it
would
be
bad
for
us
to
invalidate
the
statute,
it
would
be
wrong
for
us
to
invalidate
the
statute
on
those
grounds.
and
i
think
i
would
still
be
here
defending
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
i
don't
think
mere
theoretical
possibility
is
enough,
even
in
the
first
amendment
context.
and
i
still
think
you
ask
the
question:
does
this
individual
even
have
standing
to
bring
the
first
amendment
challenge?
and
i
would
think
an
element
of
standing
to
bring
the
first
amendment
challenge
justice
kennedy
has
in
mind
would
be
a
candidate
who,
first
of
all,
his
opposing
candidate
took
substantial
amounts
of
excess
contributions.
but
at
a
bare
minimum,
i
would
think
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
say
that,
look,
i
took
up
to
the
cap
of
the
coordinated
contributions
from
my
party
and
i
would
have
loved
to
have
gotten
more,
the
party
was
willing
to
give
me
more,
but
i
wasn't
able--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
there
is
two
things.
there
is
whether
you
can
bring
a
facial
challenge
or
not
and
there's
when
you
can
you
bring
it.
and
i
think
if
you
go
in
and
allege
that
all
of
those
things
are
likely,
then
you
probably
have
standing
at
the
outset.
but
those
allegations
weren't
made
here.
the
focus
of
this
case
has
always
been
on
the
contribution
levels
and
the
contribution
provisions
of
this
statute.
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
analysis
is
quite
similar,
so
i'm
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
all
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
and
as
you
suggest,
it's
an
unlikely
challenge
to
be
brought
because
often
times
the
self-financer
is
advertising
his
independence
from
party
and
contributors
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
but
i
think
that
they
do
have
different
ways
of
raising
the
funds
necessary
to
mount
their
campaigns.
and
i
think...
to
get
back
to
the
focus
of
this,
i
think
all
that
the
court
needs
to
recognize
is
that
the
buckley
decision
itself
has
created
a
potential
anomaly,
because
if
you
want
to
think
about
self-financing,
you
can
think
about
it
as
being
the
ultimate
form
of
soft
money,
because
the
constitution
itself
precludes
congress
from
limiting
the
amount
of
self-funding.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
other
contexts
within
the
election
area
where
there
are
comparable
disclosure
requirements.
and
i
think
i
would
point
you
to
the
mcconnell
case
and
the
fact
that
this
court
approved
a
24-hour
disclosure
requirement
for
electioneering
communications.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
mean,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that's
right
in
a
sense
that
these
are
disclosure
requirements
that
apply
across
the
board.
the
timing
is
triggered
particularly
by
a
candidate's
contribution
to
their
own
campaign.
so
that's
the
way
in
which
they're
different.
but
i
think
it's
worth
focusing
on
that,
because
i
actually
think
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
implicated
by
a
disclosure
of
a
candidate's
contribution
to
his
or
her
own
campaign
are
actually
less
significant
than
generally
is
true
of
campaign
finance
disclosure,
because
what
this
court
talked
about
in
buckley
as
the
primary
concern
in
the
disclosure
context
was
the
associational
rights
that
are
reflected
when
somebody
contributes
to
a
candidate
or
an
organization
makes
an
electioneering
communication
on
behalf
of
a
candidate.
i
think
those
associational
interests
are
obviously
not
implicated
when
all
you're
forcing
someone
to
disclose
is
the
amount
that
they
spent
on
their
own
campaign.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
i
would
think
the
constitution
would
be
more
concerned
about
the
disclosing
the
associational
link
because
there
is
more
than
one
constitutional
interest
at
issue.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
this
as
a
whole
there
really
isn't
a
differential
regime.
every
electioneering
communication
from
the
first
$10,000
has
to
be
disclosed.
if
anything,
the
complaint
should
be
the
electioneering
communication
should
come
in
here
complaining
about
the
fact
that
these
self-financing
candidates
get
a
free
pass
for
the
first
$350,000
of
their
financing,
before
the
disclosure
requirements
kick
in.
so
i
mean,
i
really
think
this
is
a
relatively
modest
disclosure
provision
and
it
arises
in
a
context
where
there
aren't
associational
interests.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that's
the
same
in
the
electioneering
communications,
which
is
it's
triggered
for
$10,000
but
i
think
it
continues
to
be
triggered.
now,
it
isn't
the
nature
of
the
challenge,
so
i
may
be
wrong
about
that,
but
i
think
that's
the
way
that
that
works.
in
any
event,
i
think
it's
a
fair
point
here
that
the
fact
that
you
trigger
additional
disclosures
with
each
$10,000
i
think
is
useful
in
informing
the
electorate;
but
i
also
think
it's
fair
to
say
is
necessary
in
order
for
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
statute
to
operate,
because
what
they
want
to
do
is
they
want
to
enable
as
a
self-financed
candidate
spends
additional
money
as
the
election
date
approaches,
they
want
to
put
the
opponent,
if
they
have
otherwise
reached
the
cap
of
what
they
can
raise
in
additional
funds
in
a
position
to
continue
to
raise
additional
funds.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it
would
be
constitutional,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
reacting
to
the
same
basic
phenomenon,
which
is
one
aspect
of
the
campaign
finance
regime
gives
self
financers
an
ability
to
spend
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
and
creates
a
potential
disparity.
what
creates
the
disparity
is
the
fact
that
you
have
relatively
low
hard
money
contribution
caps,
and
congress
recognized--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
justice
scalia,
and
again
i
think
there's
an
important
distinction
between
trying
to
level
the
playing
field
in
every
respect--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
mean,
in
an
odd
way
i
think
this
principle
is
actually
implicit
in
the
plurality
opinion
against...
in
randall
v.
sorrell.
i
know
you
didn't
join
that
opinion,
but
in
that
opinion
this
court
said,
the
plurality
said,
that
contribution
limits
can
in
some
ways
be
too
low
because
if
they're
too
low
they
preclude
the
ability
for
somebody
to
raise
enough
money
and
that
exaggerates
the
advantages
that
incumbents
have.
and
i
think
congress
really
made
an
analogous
judgment
here.
i'm
not
suggesting
it
was
constitutionally
compelled,
but
they
made
an
analogous
judgment,
which
is
there
is
more
than
one
source
of
advantage;
one
source
of
advantage
is
the
self-financing
candidate's
ability
to
spend
unlimited
amounts
of
their
own
money.
they
respected
the
fact
that
that's
a
constitutional
entitlement,
but
they
said
it's
not
that
in
the
abstract
that's
the
problem;
it's
the
combination
of
unlimited
self-financing
and
relatively
low
hard
money
contribution
caps--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
they
relaxed
the
one
thing
that
they
could
control,
which
was
the
cap.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
might
be
and
it's
not
that
radically
different
than
what
this
court
approved
in
ragan
against
taxation
without
representation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--maybe
there
are
differences
in
that
particular
context.
maybe
the
freedom
of
press
clause
informs
the
analysis.
but
this
court
has
upheld
the
regime
that
withheld
tax
benefits
to
an
organization
if
it
engaged
in
lobbying;
and
at
the
same
time
this
court
said
that
it
was
okay
to
give
those
tax
benefits--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
but
the
next
couple
of
lines
of
the
opinion
said:
and
it's
okay
if
we
give
those
tax
benefits
back
to
a
veterans
organization,
but
only
veterans
organizations.
so
i
just
think
what
that
case
shows
up
is
that
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
government
has
a
fair
amount
of
flexibility.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
there
is...
there
is
a
limiting
principle,
and
i
think
that,
importantly,
there
is
a
limiting
principle
that's
very
applicable
to
this
very
context,
which
is
i
think
if
congress
went
to
the
point
where
they
weren't
doing
what
i
think
they're
doing
here,
which
is
not
trying
to
limit
the
amount
of
self-financing,
but
using
it
as
a
mechanism
here
to
identify
particularly
costly
races
where
they
should
raise
the
contribution
limits,
if
they
went
further
and
basically
said
we're
going
to
give
you
public
financing
if
your
opponent
self-finances,
and
we're
going
to
give
you
two
dollars
for
every
dollar
that
your
opponent
self-finances,
i
think
at
that
point
as
a
practical
matter
the
regime
would
operate
as
a
ban
on...
as
a
cap,
just
like
this
court
held
in
buckley.
but
i
think
that's
the
way
to
approach
this
issue,
which
is
to
basically
say
if
what
congress
is
doing
is
really
trying
to
effectively
cap
self-expenditures,
then
congress
cannot
do
that;
but
if
what
congress
is
doing
is
giving
candidates
choice
and
is
trying
to
react
to
the
regulatory
environment
created
by
self-financing--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
i
really
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
description
of
what
happened
here,
because
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
record
here...
i
know
not
everybody
likes
to
do
that...
but
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
record
here,
you
will
see
that
both
parties
in
this,
the
opponents
and
the
proponents
of
this
amendment,
realize
that
they
couldn't
limit
self-financing
and
that
they
were
unlikely
to
limit
self-financing
because
it's
such
an
attractive
option
for
parties
and
for
candidates.
and
both
parties
took
it
as
a
given
that
the
effect
of
section
319
and
its
senate
counterpart
would
be
to
put
more
money,
not
less
money,
into
electoral
speech.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
alito,
what
i
would
say
is
that
what
the
relaxation
of
the
contribution
limits
reflects
is
an
adjustment
of
other
interests;
and
i
don't
think
in
principle
what
congress
has
done
here
is
different
from
what
a
number
of
states
do,
which
is
they
say
for
the
race
for
governor
the
contribution
cap
limit
is
going
to
be
2,000;
for
state
auditor
it
will
be
a
little
less;
and
for
local
representative
it
will
be
substantially
less.
now,
i
suppose
somebody
could
have
come
in
and
said,
look,
you
know,
the
race
for
governor
you
can
give
$2,000;
you
can
only
give
a
1,000
for
this
representative
race,
so
surely
that's
irrational
because
the
state
has
recognized
that
a
contribution
of
$2,000
is
noncorrupting.
it's
not
the
way
it's
ever
proceeded
and
i
think
this
court's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
but
i
think
you're
talking
about
congress
using
a
mechanism
that
is
equally
effective
in
identifying
races
that
are
likely
to
be
more
expensive.
when
one
party
is
spending
more
than
$350,000
of
their
own
money,
that's
every
bit
as
likely
to
be
a
more
expensive
race
than
the
race
for
governor
or
state
treasurer
or
a
local
representative.
and
that's
why
i
think
this
is
so
responsive
to
the
problem
that
congress
recognized
with
the
combination--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
can
i
say
two
things
in
response
to
that?
one
is
it
would
not
be
unprecedented
for
this
court
to
approve
a
regime
where
the
choices
of
the
candidates
led
to
different
contribution
levels
in
the
exact
same
race
for
the
exact
same
office,
because
that's
what
happens
in
buckley
in
the
public
financing
scheme
that
this
court
approved.
if
somebody
accepts
public
financing
for
the
general
election
for
presidency,
they
are
effectively
agree
to
a
zero
contribution
limit;
whereas,
their
opponent,
minor
party
opponent
for
example,
would
be
subject
to
higher
contribution
level.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
one--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
one
of
the
prices
of
accepting
the
government
subsidy
in
buckley
was
to
agree
to
limit
your
own
financing
of
your
own
campaign
to
$50,000.
now,
their
whole
theory
of
this
case
is
that
somehow
a
benefit
to
their
opponent
is
the
same
thing
as
a
detriment
to
themselves.
and
it
seems
to
me
that...
i
mean,
the
base
lines
here
are
sufficiently
manipulable;
the
analogy
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
certainly
would,
justice
breyer,
and
one
thing
to
keep
in
mind
in
interpreting
the
statute
is
that
it
has
section
401
of
the
original
bcra...
i
think
we
have
it
at
page
28
of
our
brief...
is
what
i
would
describe,
i
think,
as
a
"super-severability"
clause,
because
it
says
not
only
are
unconstitutional
provisions
severable,
but
even
unconstitutional
applications
of
the
same
provision
are
severable.
and
i
think
there
would
be
no
problem
effectively
leaving
the
statute
with
the
disclosure
requirements
in
place
and
two
of
the
three
means
of
taking
advantage
of
additional
opportunities
that
the
statute
affords
challengers.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
so
i
certainly
think
it
would
be
severable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
to
the
contrary,
on
the
theory
that
this
statute
operates
on
this
record
without
that
provision
being
implicated
at
all.
i
mean,
in
the
first
applications
of
this,
the
entirety
of
the
2004
election
cycle,
no
party
took
advantage
of
the
coordinated--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--contributions.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
mean,
i
would
concede
that
there
will
be
these
differential
limits,
but
it's
based
on
the
choice
of
the
candidate
to
engage
or
not
in
self-financing,
and...
i
mean,
the
restriction
there
is
much
more
substantial
than
the
public
financing
scheme
approved
by
this
court
in
buckley,
because
in
the
general
election
if
the
candidate
decides
that
it's
going
to...
that
a
candidate
is
going
to
take
the
public
financing
scheme
then
in
the
general
presidential
election
i
can't
give
even
a
dollar
to
that
candidate.
and
it's
also
i
think
worth
recognizing
that
in
buckley
this
court
recognized
that,
for
constitutional
and
associational
rights
purposes,
it's
really
the
ability
to
associate
with
the
candidate
by
giving
any
contribution,
rather
than
the
amount
of
the
contribution,
that
satisfies
that
limit.
in
all
events,
this
is
not
a
challenge
that's
being
brought
by
contributors.
and
i
think
it's
worth
recognizing
that
appellant,
even
though
some
of
its
challenge,
and
i
would
say
the
gravamen
of
the
challenge,
sounds...
his
challenge
sounds
in
equal
protection
terms,
he
doesn't
really
want
a
leveling-up
where
the
opportunity
would
be
for
contributors
to
both
candidates
to
make
triple
the
$2300
limits.
he
really
wants
to
keep
the
yoke
of
relatively
low
contribution
limits
on
his
opponents.
and
that's
why
i
think
this
is
such
an
odd
first
amendment
challenge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
i
have
the
hypo.
if
he
can
spend
twice
as
much?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
i'm
understanding
the
hypo
which
we
were
just
talking
about
contribution
limits,
because
there
are
no
expenditure
limits,
if
i'm
understanding
the
hypo
right,
i
think
that
would
still
be
okay.
i
mean,
i
think
if
congress
had
decided
here
that
if
a
self-financer
spends
beyond
a
certain
amount,
then
what
is
important
is
that
then
the
contribution
limits
would
be
lifted
entirely.
i
suppose
congress
could
do
that,
as
long
as
they
maintained
what
they
called
the
"parity
principle"
or
the
"proportionality
principle",
which
is
in
no
circumstance
will
the
opponent
be
able
to
raise
more
than
the
amount
of
the
additional
spending.
and
if
your
hypo
is
suggesting
that
that
would
be
relaxed
so
that
they
could
raise
twice
as
much,
i
think
that
would
raise
more
difficult
constitutional
questions.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
again,
if
i'm
understanding
the
hypo
right,
i
think
you
would
say
there
that
the
candidate
is
effectively
burdened
because
if
you
get
to
the
point
where
you're
past
what
i
would
call
$2
additional
additionally,
i
think
at
that
point
a
rational
candidate
is
not
going
to
engage
in
self-finance.
and
so
in
practice,
the
provision
would
operate
as
an
absolute
cap,
rather
than
the
way
it
operates
here,
which
is
not
as
a
cap.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
numbers
in
the
record,
joint
appendix
page
89--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they
would,
but
i
do
think
the
statute
in
practice
would
operate
quite
differently.
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
very
helpful
that
we
have
a
record
here
in
this
case
that
we
can
cite
to.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
put
it
differently
and
say
we're
not
arguing
for
a
principle
without
limits,
but
what
i
would
say
is
that
we
really
benefit
here
from
the
fact
that
this
court
found
no
standing
for
the
challenge
to
the
millionaires'
provision
in
mcconnell,
and
we
have
a
record
of
actual
experience.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
may
i
answer
the
question?
i
mean,
you're
right
that
to
the
extent
that
this
says
this
really
sounds
as
an
equal
protection
case
more
than
a
first
amendment
case,
at
the
remedial
stage
you'd
ask
the
question:
should
we
level
up
and
have
both
candidates
have
a
larger
cap
or
should
we
level
down
and
hold
them
both
to
the
$2300
level?
i
would
say
two
things,
if
i
may.
one
is
it's
no
accident
that
appellant
isn't
asking
you
to
level
up
because
what...
they're
not
interested
in
doing
additional
financing;
they're
really
taking...
interested
in
taking
advantage
of
keeping
the
opponent
down
to
the
$2300
level.
the
only
other
thing
that
i
would
say
about
this
choice
between
leveling
up
and
leveling
down
is
i
would
say
that
the
statute
that
would
have
relaxed
the
caps
for
both
candidates
would
pose
the
same
first
amendment
issue
as
this
statute.
and
so
it
really
is,
at
bottom,
an
equal
protection
claim
that
you
have
before
you.
thank
you.
