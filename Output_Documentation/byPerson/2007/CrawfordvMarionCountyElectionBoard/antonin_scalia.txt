before...
before
we
get
to
that,
can
we
talk
about
standing
a
little?
who
are
the...
who
are
the
complainants
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
courts
below
are
sometimes
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
still
have
to
identify
individuals
who
are
members.
now,
what
does
it
take
to
be
a
member
of
the
democratic
party
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought...
i
thought
they
took
the
position
that
anybody
who
voted
or
intended
to
vote
democratic
is
a
member
of
the
democratic
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
way
in
which
you
can
say...
and
i
thought
this
was
the
theory
of
associational
standing...
that
this
individual
has
voluntarily
given
this
organization
the
right
to
represent
that
person
for
particular
purposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
i'm
willing
to
have
the
democratic
party
represent
me
for
all
sorts
of
purposes.
and
these
people
can
bring
their
own
individual
challenges.
i
mean,
i'm
not
questioning
their
ability
to
do
it.
but,
but
why
is
the
democratic
party
their
representative?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
organization
had
members.
i
mean,
you
did
join
that
organization.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
identified
members
who
would
be,
who
would
be
annoyed
by
the
noise.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
even
in
its
own
right,
it
has
to
identify
somebody
that's
a
member
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly,
democrats
in
particular,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
did
you
have
anybody
who
said,
i
don't
have
a
voter
id?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
plan
to
come
in
this
next
election,
i
plan
to
vote,
and
i
don't
have
a
voter
id
card?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
we
know
that
that
religious
exemption
won't
be
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
that
that
religious
exemption
won't
be
made?
nobody's
asserted
it.
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
i
mean
in
this
in
this
case
you're
claiming
there's
a
problem
for
people
who,
for
religious
reasons,
don't
want
to
have
their
photograph
taken.
do
we
know
that
if
that's
the
reason
that
they
assert,
i
can't
get
the
photograph,
the
state
will
say
you
can't
vote?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
burden
if
you're
not
indigent?
justice
antonin
scalia
17
miles
is
17
miles
for
the
rich
and
the
poor.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
people
who
are
dead
or
have
moved
away
would
certainly
not
be
objecting.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wasn't
talking
about
that.
i
was
talking
about
whether
there
is
a
genuine
threat
of
fraud
which
the
state
is
moving
to
eliminate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
your
assertion
that,
you
know,
it's
not
much
of
a
problem
because
the
person
whom
you're
impersonating
would
find
out
about
it.
i
mean...
but
that's
certainly
not
the
case
for
people
who
have
moved
away
or
people,
you
know,
the
people
in
the
graveyards
that
are
still
on
the
rolls.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
say
likely.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why,
why
can't
the
people
injured
by
this
law
appear
themselves
and
say
the
law
can't
be
applied
to
us?
you
seem
to
accept
that
a
facial
challenge
is
appropriate
here.
why
is...
some
different
kind
of
a
facial
challenge.
i
thought
in
the
usual
facial
challenge
you
have
to
show
that
there
is
no
situation
in
which
the
law
cannot
be
constitutionally
applied.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
are
we
arguing
about
whether
there
is
one
half
of
one
percent
of
the
electorate
who
may
be
adversely
affected
and
as
to
whom
it
might
be
unconstitutional?
that
one
half
of
one
percent,
if
and
when
it
is
sought
to
be
applied
to
them,
have
a
cause
of
action
to
say
you
can't
apply
it
to
me.
but
why...
what
precedent
is
there
for
knocking
down
this
entire
law
on
a
facial
challenge
when
i
think
everybody
agrees
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
it
doesn't
impose
a
significant
hardship?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
scare
you,
mr.
fisher,
that
there
can't
be
a
facial
challenge?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
every
facial
challenge
is
an
immense
dictum
on
the
part
of
this
court,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
court
is
sitting
back
and
looking
at
the
ceiling
and
saying,
oh,
we
can
envision
not
the
case
before
us,
but
other
cases.
maybe
it's
one
half
of
one
percent
or
maybe
it's
45
percent,
who
knows.
but
we
can
imagine
cases
in
which
this
law
could
be
unconstitutional,
and
therefore,
the
whole
law
is
unconstitutional.
that's
not
ordinarily
the
way
courts
behave,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
we've
done
that
in
the
first
amendment
area.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you...
you
have
your
photograph
taken
when
you
register.
you're
really
an
out
of
state
person,
you
go
in
and
register,
you
make
up
an
address,
you
come
in,
you
have
your
photograph
taken;
it
proves
that
you
were
the
person
that
registers.
it
doesn't
prove
that
you
were
the
person
that
lives
at
that
address,
or
that
you
are
of
such
and
such
an
age
and
whatnot,
which
the...
the
means
of
identification
that
you
require
would
show,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't,
can
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
national
policy
it
to
make
it
both
easy
to
register
and
easy
to
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
for
nonindigent
people.
i
mean,
there
may
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--some
very
well
to
do
elderly,
you
don't
drive,
and
they
are
in
the
same
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
need
a
birth
certificate
to
get
a
passport?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
so
maybe
that's
unconstitutional
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
provisional
ballots
would
be
counted,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
provisional
ballots
would
be
counted.
the
ones
that
were
unconstitutionally
prevented
from
voting...
those
claims
would
be
counted.
justice
antonin
scalia
things
called
class
actions,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
do
you
do
with
illiterates
who
don't
have
a
signature?
do
you
match
"xs",
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
aren't
there
going
to
be
problems
under
any
system
you
imagine?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
increments,
why
shouldn't
we
also
ask
whether
our
judgment
does
more
harm
than
good;
whether...
whether
the
remedy
for...
for
the
inconvenience
to
a
small
number
of
people
is
to
wash
away
the
whole
statute,
which
in
most
of
its
applications
is
perfectly
okay?
why
don't
we
do
that
weighing
of
benefits
and
burdens
of
increments
versus
needs?
