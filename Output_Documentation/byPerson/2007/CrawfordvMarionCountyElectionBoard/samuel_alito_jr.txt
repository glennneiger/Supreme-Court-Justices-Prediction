justice

a.
alito,
jr.
well,
is
it
your
position
that
a
state
can't
require
any
form
of
identification
and
can
only
require
a
signature,
or
would
some
lesser
form
of
identification
than
indiana
has
required
be
constitutional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
the
answer
to
my
question?
is
any
form
of
voter
identification
beyond
a
signature
permissible
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
this
is
not
a
problem
at
all,
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
the
commission
on
federal
election
reform
that
was
co
chaired
by
former
president
carter
and
former
secretary
of
state
baker
recommended
a
voter
id
requirement,
and
many
other
countries
around
the
world
have
voter
id
requirements?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
would
they
even
require
that
if
it's
not
any
problem
at
all?
doesn't
it
at
least
show
that
it
is
a
problem
of
some
dimension,
maybe
not
as
severe
as
indiana
claims,
but
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
sort
of
photo
id
problem,
requirement,
if
there
were
no
problem
whatsoever.
isn't
that
true?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you
concede
that
some
kind
of
voter
id
requirement
is
appropriate,
the
problem
that
i
have
is
where
you
draw
the
line
on
a
record
like
this
where
there's
nothing
to
quantify
in
any
way
the
extent
of
the
problem
or
the
extent
of
the
burden,
how
many
people
will
actually
be
prevented
from
voting
or
significantly
burdened
from
voting
as
a
result
of
the
requirement?
how
do
we
tell
whether
this
is
on
one
side
of
the
line
or
the
other
side
of
the
line?
