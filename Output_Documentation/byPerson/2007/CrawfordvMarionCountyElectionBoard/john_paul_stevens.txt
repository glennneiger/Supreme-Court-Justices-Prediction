mr.
smith,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
the
extent
to
which
the
political
parties
help
people
get
their
ids,
as
they
sometimes
drive
them
to
the
polls
for
voting
and
so
forth,
the
part
they
play
in
this
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
fair
to
presume
that
the
parties
would
play
a
role
in
helping
people
get
registered
and
getting
to
the
polls?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't...
you
don't
have
the
photo
identification
required
at
registration,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
you
have
the
same
from
in
being
sure
the
registration
is
correct?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
you
require
photo
id
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
policy
to
have
it
tougher
to
vote
than
to
register?
that
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
unrealistic
to
assume
it
would
be
easier
to
file
a
lawsuit
and
go
off
with
the
burden
of
litigation
rather
than
go
back
to
get
the
second
affidavit?
if
you're
challenging
two
affidavits,
you
know,
to
have
a
federal
case
over
it
seems
a
little
bit
improbable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
look
at
the
real
world
impact
and
you
ask
whether
the
democratic
party
has
standing
to
challenge
the
law,
is
it
relevant
that
the
state
legislature
is
split
entirely
on
party
lines?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
you
think
it's
fair
to
infer
that
this
law
does
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
democrats
that
is
different
from
its
impact
on
the
republicans?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
three
cases
come
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
cases
concerned
indiana's
voter
identification
law
passed
in
2005
that
requires
indiana
voters
to
present
government-issued
photo
identification
before
voting.
promptly,
after
the
law's
enactment,
petitioners
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana,
seeking
to
enjoin
election
officials
from
enforcing
the
law.
petitioners
argued
that
the
voter
id
law
unconstitutionally
burdens
indiana
citizens'
right
to
hold
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
specifically,
they
claimed
that
indiana's
interest
in
enacting
such
a
law
to
combat
in-person
fraudulent
voting,
did
not
justify
the
burdens
of
voter
id
law
imposed
on
voters
who
did
not
already
have
acceptable
photo
identification.
the
district
court
rejected
petitioners'
arguments
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
election
officials.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
both
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
noted
the
absence
of
any
plaintiffs
who
claimed
that
the
law
would
deter
them
from
voting.
we
granted
certiorari
because
of
the
importance
of
these
cases
to
voting
laws
throughout
the
country
and
we
now
affirm.
in
the
opinion
that
i
have
authored
through
which
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy,
we
hold
that
the
petitioners'
evidence
is
not
sufficient
to
support
a
facial
attack
on
the
validity
of
indiana's
voter
id
law.
indiana's
interest
in
preventing
voter
fraud
in
safeguarding
public
confidence
in
elections
are
legitimate
and
weighty
and
petitioners
have
failed
to
prove
an
excessive
burden
on
any
class
of
voters
because
petitioners
advanced
a
broad
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
voter
id
law
and
seek
to
invalidate
in
its
entirety,
they
bearing
a
specially
heavy
burden
of
persuasion.
for
further
--
for
reasons
further
elaborated
in
our
opinion,
they
have
not
met
that
burden.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
which
justice
thomas
and
justice
alito
has
joined.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
and
justice
breyer
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
