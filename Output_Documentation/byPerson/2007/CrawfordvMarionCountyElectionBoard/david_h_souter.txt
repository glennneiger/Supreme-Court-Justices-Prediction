justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
though,
mr.
smith,
the
trial
court
didn't
rely
on,
simply
on
the
associational
standing
of
the
democratic
party,
did
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
doing
so
by
forcing
them
to
get
people
properly
identified.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
telling
us
that,
you
know,
we've
got
to
be
careful
and
it's
difficult.
but
justice
alito's
question
is:
what
are
we
supposed
to
look
at,
how
are
we
supposed
to
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
get
down...
let's
get
down
to
the
question
of
quantification,
which
is
one
of
the
issues
that
he
raised.
what's
your
response
to
the
issue
that
there
is
no
quantification
of
the
actual
burden
measured
by
the
number
of
voters
who
are
going
to
be
adversely
affected?
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
talk
about
indiana.
what
have
you
got...
what
is...
what
is
your
best
argument
for
indiana?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
many
of
them
are
going
to
suffer
from
an
unreasonable
denial
of
an
opportunity
to
get
the
id
which
the
state
will
provide
through
the
bureau
of
motor
vehicles?
how
do
we
quantify
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know
that.
that's
why
it's
a
tough
issue.
but
how
do...
how
are
we
going
to...
how
is
a
court
going
to
arrive
at
some
kind
of
a
bottom
line
judgment
on
this
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
that's
on...
that's
on
the
other
side
of
the
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
walk...
walk
us
through...
if
you
were
writing
the
opinion
and
what
you
wanted
to
put
in
the
opinion
was
a
reasonable
estimate
of
the
number
of
people
who
are
going
to
be
substantially
burdened
in
having...
who
do
not
now
have
the
identification,
substantially
burdened
in
getting
it.
what
approximate
number
would
you
arrive
at
and
how
would
you...
how
would
you
get
to
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
accept
the
figure
of,
what,
about
50,000,
to
be
further
discounted
by
those
who
might
vote
absentee
and
so
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
just
want
to...
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
figure.
mr.
smith
was
starting
with
400
and
then
getting
it
down
2
and
so
on.
and
my
recollection
in
the
red
brief
is
that
you
said,
all
right,
let's
take
the
43,000
figure.
i
forget
what
you
discounted
it
for,
but
it
got
it
down
to
25,000.
some
of
those
would
be
able
to
vote
absentee,
but
this...
i
take
it
you're
conceding
that,
at
least
subject
to
some
discount,
there
are
probably
about
25,000
people
who
may
be
affected
by
this
adversely.
is
that
clear?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
a
little
bit
of
a
stretch,
too,
when
you
say
"infinitesimal"?
i
mean,
if
you
take
your
two
thirds
figure
and
so
on,
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
you're
probably
going
to
get
down
to
something
like
10,000
people
or
10,000
plus
who
are
going
to
be
affected
in
the
sense
that
they're
going
to
have
to
scurry
around
if,
if
they're
going
to
get
the
appropriate
id?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
10...
isn't
the
concern
over
10,000
voters
a
sufficiently
substantial
concern
to...
to
be
considered
as
something
more
than
merely
de
minimis
and
is
something
that
should
count
in
a
facial
challenge?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
haven't
endorsed...
i
mean,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
we
haven't
endorsed
a
registration
procedure
that
would
require
as
much
documentation
and
as
much
travel
as...
as
the...
as
this
voter
id
procedure
would
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
agree
that
if
you're
going
to
take
the...
if
this
court
takes
the
salerno
standard,
there
can
never
be
a
facial
challenge
to
a
registration
requirement,
a
voter
id
requirement.
in
other
words,
it's
not
merely
that
this
facial
challenge
would
be
knocked
out;
there
never
could
be
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
salerno
says
unless
there
are
no
cases,
the
facial
challenge
is
inappropriate.
and
that...
in
the
real
world
that
will
never
be
true
with
respect
to
a...
a
voter
id
law,
will
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
never
will
be
true,
will
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
never
be...
if
that's
going
to
be
the
standard,
there
will
never
be
a
facial
challenge.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
never
will
be
there
one,
will
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
as
to
a
pre
enforcement
facial
challenge
to
a
law
like
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
want
you
to
answer
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
not
going
to
have
facial
challenges
here,
are
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
making
the
argument
that
you
can
place
a
heavier
burden
on
voters
to
identify
themselves
because
your
state
officials
refuse
to
follow
the
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that's
the
argument
you
were
just
making.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
when
we
identify
the
duplicates,
the
local
officials
are
still
leaving
them
in
the
polls.
i
mean,
surely
you're
not
going
to
rest
your
case
on
that,
are
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
still
making
the
argument
that
there's
a
lack
of
confidence
because
our
local
officials
won't
cull
the
rolls
of
dead
voters.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
there
is
a
reasonable,
obvious
step
you
can
take
to
make
your
officials
obey
the
law
when
you
tell
them
how
to
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
now
wait
a
minute.
are
you
telling
me
that
you
are
limited
by
some
federal
statute
from
preventing
local
officials...
i'm
sorry,
from
forcing
local
officials
to
take
the
action
to
cull
the
rolls
of
dead
voters,
when
you
have
identified
those
dead
voters
for
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
it's
indiana's
responsibility
to
cull
those
rolls.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
a
legitimate
argument
to
say
we
can
put
a
heavier
burden
on
identifying...
on
voters
to
identify
themselves
because
our
officials
are
being
contumacious.
you
don't
rest
on
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
good.
i
thought
you
were.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
didn't
make
that
argument
now.
i
mean
we
don't
have
to
wait
until
after
an
election
to
hear
that,
any
more
than
we
have
to
wait
until
after
an
election
to
identify
the
voters
that
justice
ginsburg
has.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
be
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
would
be
a
virtue,
but
one
of
the
vices
would
be
that
it
would
be
after
the
election
and
the
entire
matter
would
be
academic
for
another
2
years,
until
another
2
years
had
passed.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
we
assume
that
everyone
who
has
a
decent
claim
under
this
act
went
through
the
hoops
to
get
the
provisional
ballot
at
the...
wherever
the
county
office
is
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
an
assumption
which
need
not
necessarily
be
made.
