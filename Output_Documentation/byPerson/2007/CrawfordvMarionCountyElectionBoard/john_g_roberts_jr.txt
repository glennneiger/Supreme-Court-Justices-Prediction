chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-21
and
07-25,
crawford
v.
marion
county
election
board
and
indiana
democratic
party
v.
secretary
rokita.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
can
limit
your
standing
argument
to...
i
guess
it's
based
on
the
affidavits
of
ms.
holland
and
ms.
smith,
the
one
who
is
a
clerk
for
the
democratic
party
and
the
other
who
is
a
judge
for
the
democratic
party.
we
don't
have
to
agree
with
you
that
anybody
who
votes,
might
vote
democratic,
is
enough
to
give
you
standing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
understood
judge
barker
to
say
that
you
had
not
come
up
with
a
single
instance
of
somebody
who
was
denied
the
right
to
vote
because
they
didn't
have
a
photo
id.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
elections
were
conducted
under
this
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
why...
and
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
one
even
though
the
state
will
provide
them
with
one
if
they
don't
have
one,
subject
to
some
identification?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
be
potentially
constitutional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
we
should
ignore
your
religious
objection
argument
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
far
away
is
the
furthest
county
seat
for
somebody
in
the
county,--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--county
seats
aren't
very
far
for
people
in
indiana.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have...
the
record
shows
that
fewer
than
1
percent
of
people
in
indiana
don't
have
a
photo
id.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
do
the
voting
rolls.
i
thought
the
district
court
found
41--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--mr.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--41.4
percent
of
the
people
on
the
voting
rolls
in
indiana
were
either
dead
or
they
were
duplicate
entries.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
take
issue
with
the
41.4
percent
figure
for
bad
entries
on
the
voting
registration
rolls?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
this
is
one
of
them,
i
suppose,
requiring
photo
id?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
don't
you
think
if
you
have
the
voter
rolls
with
a
significant
number
of
bad
registrants,
either
dead
or
duplicates,
that
that
presents
a
significant
potential
for
fraud?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
it's
less
of
an
issue.
if
somebody
wins
an
election
by
500,000
votes,
you
may
not
be
terribly
worried
if
some
percentage
were
cast
by
fraud,
but
you
might
look
to
the
future
and
realize
there
could
be
a
closer
election
and
there...
it's
a
type
of
fraud
that,
because
it's
fraud,
it's
hard
to
detect.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
problem
with
the
duplicate
entries
is
there
may
be
two
entries
for
john
smith
because
john
smith
has
moved
and
the
voter
registration
hasn't
been
updated.
so
all
you
need
is
somebody
else
to
go
in
and
say:
i'm
john
smith,
this
is
my
address.
and
later
in
the
day
somebody
else
comes
in
and
says:
i'm
john
smith
and
this
is
my
address.
and
because
they're
duplicates
it's
really
difficult
to
check.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
help
you
get
it.
they
say
if
you
don't
have
an
id
we'll
give
you
one.
if
you
don't
have
a
photo
id,
come
in
and
we'll
give
you
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
documentation
did
president
carter
and
secretary
baker
propose
to
require
for
their
photo
ids?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
fisher,
you
make...
rely
on
the
argument
that
40
percent
of
the
registrants...
or
not
registrants,
the
people
on
the...
yes,
registrants...
on
the
voter
list
are...
are
not
accurate.
that
argument
is
a
little
difficult
to...
to
take
because
what
you're
saying
is
we
do
such
a
lousy
job
on
registration
that
we
should
be
able
to
do
a...
have
a
more
stringent
voting
requirement.
why
do
you
do
such
a
lousy
job
on
registration?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
were
sued
by
the
federal
government
because
you
did
such
a
bad
job.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
presumably
the
challenges
could
be
adjudicated.
you
have
10
days
to
go
down
to
the
courthouse
when
you
file
a
provisional
ballot,
and
if
it
turns
out
the
election
was
decided
by
three
votes
and
there
are
30
provisional
ballots,
presumably
the
challenge
can
be
brought
at
that
point
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
there
is
standing
in
this
case
to
bring
the
facial
challenge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
mr.
smith,
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
it
serves
no
purpose.
what
if
we
determine
that
it
does
serve
a
purpose
in
preventing
fraud.
how
are
we
supposed
to
weigh
that
against
your
asserted
burden
on
the
right
to
vote?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
