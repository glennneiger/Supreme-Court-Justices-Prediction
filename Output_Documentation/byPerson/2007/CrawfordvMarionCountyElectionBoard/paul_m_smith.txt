mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
law
that
directly
burdens
our
most
fundamental
right,
the
right
to
vote.
those
indiana
voters
who
lack
the
identification
now
required
by
the
new
photo
id
law
must
overcome
substantial
practical
and
financial
burdens
before
they
can
continue
to
exercise
their
constitutional
right.
now,
the
state
says
that
those
burdens
are
justified
by
the
need
to
stamp
out
the
scourge
of
voter
impersonation
fraud
at
the
polls,
but
this
court
has
made
clear
many
times
that
such
a
justification
should
not
just
be
accepted
at
face
value,
but
instead
it
should
be
scrutinized
to
assure
that
the
claimed
state
interest
is
both
real
and
sufficiently
weighty
to
justify
the
burden
being
imposed
on
constitutional
rights.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
there
are
many
plaintiffs,
your
honor,
including
the
ones
that
the
courts
below
found
have
standing,
the
democratic
party.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely,
and
especially
when
i'm
a
petitioner
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
but
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
democratic
party
was
found
to
have
standing
correctly,
i
believe,
on
at
least
two
grounds,
associational
standing
as
well
as
what
you
might
call
haven
standing,
the
organizational
interest
being
impaired
by
virtue
of
this
law.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
in
indiana
you
become
a
member
of
the
democratic
party
by
participating
in
party
affairs.
they
did
identify
members
who
are
activists,
who
are
poll
workers,
and
that's
why
the
district
court
said
that
as,
as
to
the
equal
protection
claim
those
people
were
sufficient
to
satisfy
associational
standing.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
there
are
different
degrees
of
membership,
different
ways
to
become
a
member,
as
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there
is
no
formal
method
of
induction
as
you
would
have
in
the
elk's
club
or
something,
your
honor.
but
there
clearly
are
methods
by
which
you
become
a
participant
in
the
affairs
of
the
party.
for
example,
to
vote
in
the
primary
you
have
to
aver
that
you
have
either
supported
democratic
candidates
in
the
last
election
or
intend
to
in
a
future
election.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
because
they
have...
the
democratic
party
is
an
association
of
people
joined
together
to
elect
candidates
of
a
particular
kind
and
those
people
include
many
people
who
are
burdened
by
this
law.
this
seems
to
be
the
absolutely
quintessential
case
for
associational
standing,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
as
well
on
havens
realty
and
said
that
the
organizational
interests
of
the
party
are
being
impaired
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
this
is
putting
a
burden
on
them
achieving
their
goal,
the
democratic
party's
goal,
of
electing
its
candidates.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
extend
resources
getting
people,
get
their
identification.
it's
very
much
like
the
metropolitan
washington
airports
authority
case
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
which
involved
a
nonprofit
organization
aimed
at
trying
to
keep
the
noise
level
down
at
national
airport
that
was
impaired
by
an
unconstitutional
statute
in
that
case
as
well.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i'd
note,
your
honor,
that
in
the
hunt
case
itself
there
were
no
members.
the
court
said
it
doesn't
really
matter
because
the
state
agency
that
had
associational
standing
in
hunt
functioned
for
all
purposes
as
the
representatives
of
those,
of
those
apple
farmers,
but
there
was
no
formal
membership
organization,
no
members
per
se
at
all.
but
the
court
said
that
shouldn't
make
a
difference
because
there's
really
no
actual
functional
difference
between
the
two
situations.
i
would
certainly
submit--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well
your
honor,
the
thing
that
confines
the
rationale
is
it
has
to
be
something
that
relates
as
well
to
the
purpose
of
the
organization,
of
the
association,
the
reason
why
these
people
are
bound
together
as
a
group,
and
that
is
of
course
to
get
people
to
vote
and
vote
to
support...
support
the
goals
of
the
organization,
support
the
candidates,
the
nominees
of
the
organization.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but
we
also
have
other
people
in
the
record,
your
honor...
for
example,
theresa
clemente,
others
who
are
active
poll
workers,
activists
in
the
party,
who...
had
been
polled
and
found
that
they
didn't
have
ids
and
that
they
would
be
burdened
by
the
difficulty
of
getting
ids.
so
that
that...
there
is
specific
standing
evidence
in
there
of
specific
people
who,
much
more
than
just
your
average
voter,
are
active
in
party
affairs.
they
may
not
have
a...
be
card
carrying
members
of
the
democratic
party,
but
they
are
as
much
a
part
of
the
democratic
party
as
anybody
possibly
could
be,
who
were
identified
in
response
to
interrogatories,
about
9
or
10
of
them,
and
were
found
to
be
satisfactory
for
purposes
of
standing
by
the
district
court
on
the
equal
protection
claim.
now,
in
addition
i
would
note
as
i
suggested
to
justice
souter,
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
associational
standing
because
the
democratic
party
clearly
is
injured
in
its
own
right
as
an
organization.
now,
if
i
could
turn
to
the
merits
then,
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no.
when
it's
in
its
own
right
the
association,
the
organization,
is
injured,
your
honor.
now,
the
question...
if
what
you're
suggesting,
is
there
enough
evidence
here
that
people
are
actually
being
prevented
from
voting?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
a
great
deal
of
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
burdens
that
are
imposed
on
people
who
try
to
comply
with
this
law
and
continue
exercising
their
constitutional
right
to
vote.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
the
record
in
this
case
was
made
when
an
election
had
not
yet
happened.
so
that
comment,
while
it
was
certainly
made,
i
don't
quite
understand
its
significance.
this
case
was
brought
to
try
to
prevent
an
irreparable
loss
of
constitutional
rights
in
advance
of
the
implementation
of
this
law.
i
think
it
had
been
used
in
two
little
towns
in
'05,
montezuma,
indiana,
but
other
than
that--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i'm
not
even...
there
were
a
couple
of
hundred
people
that
had
voted
under
the
law,
but
nobody
else
had
yet,
at
that
point.
now,
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
that's
the
9
or
10
people
who
came
from
the
poll
worker
survey.
there
was
also
a
considerable
amount
of
testimony
about
other
people
who
said
they
wanted
to
vote,
who
spoke
to
many
of
the
other
plaintiffs,
mr.
crawford,
the
naacp
chapter.
there's
a
lot
of
other
plaintiffs
who
also
submitted
evidence
of
people
saying:
i
don't
have
an
id,
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
one,
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
vote.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
but
what
the
state
did
in
2002
was
it
ratcheted
up
the
difficulty
of
getting
one
by
requiring
for
the
first
time
that
you
have
an
original
certified
birth
certificate
that
you
paid
for
and
that...
and
then
you
have
to
go
through
the
hoops
of
what
kind
of
identification
you
need
for
that.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
it
may
well
be
possible
that
there's
certain
situations
that
it
could
require
it.
each
case
is
a
balancing
test.
as
the
court
said
in
timmons,
you
have
to
make
hard
judgments
on
the
specific
facts
of
each
case
and
identify
both
the
state
interest
being
served,
the
incremental
state
interest
being
served,
and
the
degree
of
the
burdens.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
it's
readily
available
and
not
especially
burdensome
and
there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
it
is
preventing
a
fraud
of
some
sort,
serving
some--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
true--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
it
is
certainly
true
that,
in
fact,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
any
significant
amount
of
fraud
that
is
still
occurring
with
the
existing
system
of
voter
identification.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think...
i
think
that
the
current
system
works
just
fine.
so
if
there's
any
degree
of
burden
being
imposed
on
the
voter
by
some
additional
identification
requirement,
then
i
would
say
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
if
you
had
a
world
in
which
that
were
true,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
potentially
constitutional.
that's
a
very
different
world
than
the
one
we
live
in,
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i
was
assuming
that
we
would
make
some
additional
exemptions
for
particular
people
with
those
kinds
of
problems,
if
people
can't
have
one.
if
the
question
is,
if
everybody
has
a
photo
id
in
their
pocket
is
it
constitutional
to
require
them
to
show
them
at
the
voting
booth,
the
answer
to
that
i
think
is
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
i'm
not...
i'm
not--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
must
be
misunderstanding.
we
have
every
reason
to
think
that
they
will
let
them
vote.
the
only
problem
with
that
exemption,
like
the
indigency
exception,
is
that
it's
kind
of
gratuitively
burdensome
in
that
you
have
to
go
down
to
the
county
seat
to
vote
every
time;
you
can't
vote
in
your
polling
place
because
you
have
to
fill
out
this
affidavit
every
time
you
vote.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
either
way,
your
real
voting
place
is
going
to
be
the
county
clerk's
office
in
the
county
seat,
forever.
that's...
it's
not
that
they
won't
do
it;
it's--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
don't
know
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no.
if
you're
an
indigent
person,
your
honor,
in
lake
county,
in
gary,
indiana,
you'd
have
to
take
the
bus
17
miles
down
to
crown
point
to
vote
every
time
you
want
to
vote.
and
if
you're
indigent
that's
a
significant
burden,
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
it's...
it's
less
of
a
burden,
your
honor,
considerably
less
of
a
burden.
you--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--public
transportation,
because
the
person
presumably
has
no
access
to
an
automobile
because
they
don't
have
a
driver's
license
and
they're
indigent
and
they're
living
in
gary,
indiana.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that
is
not
what
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
and
it's
not
what
the
district
court
said.
i
think
it's...
it
would
be
really
a
travesty
if
this
court
decided
the
case
on
that
assumption.
what
the
district
court
said
is
if
you
compare
the
voting
age
population
in
the
census
to
the
total
number
of
driver's
licenses
and
ids
that
have
been
issued,
you
get
that
disparity
of
43,000
or
1
percent,
but
what
the
district
court
went
on
to
say
is
this
is
probably
not
accurate
because
the
total
of
licenses
and
ids
includes
all
the
people
who
have
died
and
left
the
state
and
their
licenses
are
still
unexpired.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
no.
the
population--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--so
sorry.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but
she
wasn't
looking
at
the
voting
rolls.
she
was
comparing
population
in
the
census
as
of
2005
with
the
driver's
license
records.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
i
have
no
reason
to...
it
may
have
gotten
better
now.
they
apparently
have
instituted
a
lot
of
efforts
in
the
last
3
years
to
make
it
better,
but--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no,
i
was
referring
to
actually
cleaning
up
the
voter
rolls
in
compliance
with
the
consent
decree
they
signed
with
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
suppose.
i
don't
know
if
i
can
say
significant.
the
situation
has
existed
for
now
a
number
of
years,
and
the
salient
fact
here
is
that
there's
not
a
single
recorded
example
of
voter
impersonation
fraud.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
it's
actually
not,
your
honor.
it's
the
type
of
fraud
that
the
elections
commission
said...
found
is
unlikely,
the
most
unlikely,
because
it's
not
that
hard
to
detect.
when
you're
going
into
the
polls
and
saying,
i'm
joe
smith,
you're
dealing
with
a
neighborhood
person
who
knows
a
lot
of
people
who
are
there,
you
have
to
match
that
person's
signature.
and
if
that
person
shows
up
later
on
to
vote--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
the
duplicates,
presumably,
are
in
two
different
places,
right.
so
they
would
vote
in
two
different
places.
but
if...
what
the...
the
fraudfeasor
doesn't
know
is
where
the
real
john
smith
is
going
to
vote.
so
if
he
goes
in
and
votes
in
one
place
and
says,
well,
i'm
going
to...
i
expect
he's
going
to
go
in
the
other
place,
sooner
or
later,
if
you
had
any
significant
amount
of
this
kind
of
fraud
occurring,
people
would
be
coming
in
and
saying
i
can't
vote.
somebody
says
i
already
voted.
it's
not
happening
and,
indeed,
every
single
indication
in
this
record
is
that
the
evidence
of
this
kind
of
fraud
occurring,
to
call
it
scant
is
to
overstate
it.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
your
honor.
i
was
talking
about
the
disparity
between
the
number
of
people
in
the
voting
age
population
and
the
number
of
licenses
and
saying
you
can't
assume
it's
only
a
one
percent
differential.
it's
actually
more
like
an
eight
or
nine
percent
differential.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
question
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--it's
certainly
possible
that
someone
could
commit
this
kind
of
a
crime.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
one
of
the
things
that
makes
it
less
likely
is
if
you
try
to
actually
affect
an
election
you
need
to
sway
a
lot
of
votes.
and
in
order
to
do
that
this
way
you'd
have
to
have
100
or
200
or
500
co
conspirators,
each
of
them
assigned
an
identity,
learning
the
signature
of
that
person,
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--first
of
all,
on
the
point
of
the
anecdotes,
i
would
encourage
you
to
look
at
the
brennan
center
brief.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
many
kinds
of
fraud
do
get
caught,
and
they
are
no
more
easily
detected
than
this
kind
of
fraud
to
be
detected.
but
this
kind
of
fraud
is
not
being
caught.
no
one
has
been
punished
for
this
kind
of
fraud
in
living
memory
in
this
country.
this
is
not--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
but
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--first
of
all...
first
of
all,
you
talk
about
deterring
it.
you
deter
it
by
the
signature
match,
by
having
to
have
the
same
age,
by
having
to
get
past
people
who
know
a
lot
of
the
people
in
the
precinct,
and
by
having
very
severe
criminal
penalties.
and
then
you
have--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--what
they
recommended,
your
honor,
is
exactly
what
justice
ginsburg
anticipated,
which
is
get
everybody
the
cards,
and
then
we'll
be
like
europe,
and
everything
will
work
really
fine,
and
it'll
actually
help
the
poor
to
have
these
ids
for
a
lot
of
other
purposes.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
would
encourage
the
court
to
refer
to
the
democratic
party
exhibit
18,
which
is
an
article
by
carter,
president
carter,
and
secretary
baker,
following
on
their
report,
saying,
look,
there's
a
problem
here;
that
12
percent
of
the
voting
age
population
of
this
country
doesn't
have
a
license;
we
did
not
recommend
this
being
a
mandatory
thing
until
we
get
those
licenses
in
those
people's
hands.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
some
states
don't
have
signature
matches.
there
may
have
been
a
minimal
amount
of
additional
benefit
in
some
states
from
having
that
added.
that
was
a
decision
they
ultimately
made,
with
some
dissents.
the
reality,
though,
is
if
you
do
it
not
their
way,
but
the
indiana
way,
which
is
to
say
you
need
an
id,
we're
not
going
to
help
you
get
it,
in
fact
we're
going
to
ratchet
up
the
requirements
for
making
you
get
it,
and
we're
going
to
charge
you
money
for
it,
then
what
you
have
is
a
very
different
system.
then
you
have--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but
what
the
record
shows
is
that
60
percent
of
the
time,
when
people
go
in
and
ask
for
one,
they
get
sent
home,
because
they
don't
have
the
right
documentation
because
the
rules--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--your
honor,
i
think
they
were
very
strong
on
having
this
birth
certificate
requirement,
as
well.
so
they...
they
were
talking
about
the
real
id
law
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so
i'm
not
specific
about
what
the
report
says
on
that,
but
they
certainly
thought
there
should
be...
obviously,
in
the
wake
of
9/11
there
is
some
concern
about
giving
out
these
things
too
readily.
so
i'm
reasonably
sure
they
supported
a
birth
certificate
requirement
as
well.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
it
is
a
difficult
area
of
the
law
for
you
for
that
reason,
justice
alito.
but
if
you
like
at
timmons
what
it
says
is
there's
no
litmus
test,
there's
no
escaping
the
hard
judgments.
this
is
the
area
where
the
courts
have
to
be
not
too
deferential
even
though
there
are
hard
judgment
calls
about
matters
of
degree,
because
this
is
an
area
where
the
concern
is
that
the
legislative
branch
and
the
executive
branch
are
going
to
abuse
their
power
to
regulate
the
electoral
process
to
find
subtle
ways
to
skew
the
outcome
on
election
day.
as
john
hard
ely
says,
this
is
an
area
where
judicial
review
is
the
most
important,
the
most
legitimate.
and
so
you
can't
shy
away
from
that
even
though
there
are
difficult
matters
of
balancing
involved
and--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--you
are
supposed
to
look
at
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
the
id,
what
assistance
is
provided
or
not
being
provided,
how
much
it
costs.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
answer
is
that
there's
plenty
of
evidence
in
the
record
about
the
number
of
people
in
this
country
who
don't
have
ids.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
best
argument
for
indiana
is
if
you
take
the
district
court's
43,000
figure
and
you
adjust
it
for
the
two
factors,
death
and
departure,
that
i
mentioned
before,
the
number
becomes
more
like
400,000
people
in
the
state
of
indiana
who
lack
ids
and
are
of
voting
age,
eligible...
voting
age
population
people.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
is
obviously
for
each
person
a
different
matter
of
degree.
the
burdens
here
are
along
a
whole
spectrum
because
some
people
don't
have
a
birth
certificate,
some
people
have...
don't
have
a
birth
certificate,
but
they
have
money.
some
people
don't
have
a
birth
certificate
and
they
don't
have
money.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
because
you...
you
basically
have
to
take
into
account
all
of
those
factors:
how
many
people
are
potentially
affected;
how
difficult
it
is;
how
similar
it
is
to,
say,
a
poll
tax,
for
example,
and
say...
and
then
look
at
what
purpose
is
being
served
here.
is
there
any
real
incremental
benefit
to
anything
by--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
of
that
400,000
voting
age
people,
probably
about
half
of
them
are
registered
voters.
it
stands
to
reason
that
most
of
them
are
lower
income
people,
and
that
therefore,
the
burden
even
of
having
to
pay
for
the
birth
certificate
is
a
significant
one.
that...
so
that
a
very
substantial
portion
of
that
200,000
people
in
order--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i'm
not
aware
of
anything,
your
honor.
this
is
a
fairly
new
law
at
the
time
this
record
was
being
put
together
in
2005.
but
certainly,
the
parties--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--but,
you
know,
what
there
is
in
the
record,
your
honor,
is
the
testimony
from
the
lafayette
urban
ministry,
which
helps
the
needy
in
lafayette,
indiana.
they
had
150
people
come
to
them
and
say:
we
want
your
help
to
get
ids.
a
year
later,
less
than
75
had
succeeded
because
they
found
themselves
caught
in
this
catch-22,
where
they
went
to
get
a
birth
certificate,
they
didn't
have
a
driver's
license,
they
didn't
have
the
other
kinds
of
very
narrowly
specified
ids
they
needed,
and
so
they
were
basically
in
this
bureaucratic
maze,
and
they
couldn't
get
out
of
it
even
with
the
kind
of
assistance
you're
imagining,
your
honor.
if
i
might
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
let
me
start
by
addressing
the
question
of
what
reasonable
alternatives
there
are
to
the
strict
law
that
we
are
dealing
with
here.
this
is
the
most
strict
law
in
the
country.
and
what
you
have
when
you
look
at
the
range
of
laws
that
are
out
there
in
other
states
is
a
very
different
set
of
responses
that
occur
when
a
voter
shows
up
without
an
id
in
hand.
in
michigan
and
several
other
states,
for
example,
the
response
is
to
say:
all
right,
we
are
going
to
make
you
fill
out
an
affidavit
attesting
to
who
you
are,
and
that
you
are
a
registered
voter;
that
you
live
in
this
precinct;
and
we'll
let
you
go
ahead
and
vote
a
regular
ballot.
that
in
those
states
they...
they
consider
that
a
sufficient
safeguard
while
looking
at
the
ids
of
all
the
people
who
have
the
ids.
in
florida
they
have
a
different
approach,
which
is
to
let
you
vote
a
provisional
ballot,
and
then
what
they
do
is
they
judge
your
signature
match
later
on
in
exactly
the
same
process
that's
used
for
absentee
ballots.
we
have
a
lot
of
information
in
this
record
about
why
it's
okay
to
have
absentee
ballots
allowed
without
an
id
in
indiana,
and
they
say,
well,
we
have
these
specialized
committees
that
know
how
to
do
signature
matches;
and
they
are
trained;
and
so
we
get
thousands
of
these
absentee
ballots
in.
but
we
can
very
carefully
scrutinize
them.
you
could
do
very
easily
do
exactly
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
provisional
ballots
cast
by
people
who
show
up
without
their
id
without--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes,
there
are;
and
it's
this
court's
job
under
the
burdick
line
of
cases
to
weigh
the
benefits
and
the
burdens
and
come
out
with
the
appropriate
decision
about
whether
the
legislature
went
too
hard...
far.
let
me
talk
a
little
bit
about
this
facial
versus
as
applied
approach.
to
paraphrase
king
lear:
that
way
lies
madness,
your
honor.
this
court
has
never
looked
at
these
issues
on
an
as
applied
basis.
the
burdick
test,
in
its
very
nature,
is
about
facial
weighing
of
systemic
benefits
and
burdens
from
the
particular
rule.
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that,
because
the
concern
is
systemic;
that
the
burdens
that
are
being
imposed,
a
whole
range
of
them
depending
on
the
kind
of
people
involved
and
their
particular
circumstances,
will
have
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
election
overall.
imagine,
if
you
will,
what
it
would
be
like
to
try
to
have
all
these
class
actions
being
brought,
some
by
the
people
who
don't
have
ids,
some
by
the
people
who
have
ids
but
don't
have
enough
money.
you
would
have
to
figure
out
exactly
how
much
money
people
are
allowed
to
have
in
order
to
be
in
this
exempt
class.
the
courts
would
then
be
creating
exempt
classes,
trying
to
decide
whether
the
legislature
would
have
wanted
an
exemption
drawn
or
not.
the
whole
thing
would
be
a
complete
and
utter
morass.
and,
ultimately,
even
if
you
did
carve
out
an
exception
for
indigent
people
or
for
some
other
group
of
people,
you
ultimately
would
leave
untouched
the
real
problem,
which
is
the
concern
that
even
for
people
who
are
relatively...
suffer
relatively
minor
inconvenience,
maybe
one
percent
of
them
are
not
going
to
show
up
and
vote.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
legislature
may
have
been
trying
to
accomplish
here.
so
that
is
not
the
way
the
jurisprudence
in
this
area
ever
looks
at
it.
nobody
applied
the
poll...
nobody
challenged
the
poll
tax
as
applied.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that
it
imposes
a
range
of
burdens
on
people
from
quite
severe
to
less
severe,
and
those
burdens
vastly
outweigh
the...
any
incremental
state
interest
that
is
being
served,
your
honor.
that's
our...
our
analysis,
and
i
think
it's
certainly
completely
consistent
with
every
decision
right
up
through
klingman
a
couple
of
years
ago.
that's
the
test
that
this
court
applies.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
you
have
to
make
some
judgment
about
the
incremental,
additional
benefit
above
what's
already
been
in
place
for
decades,
and
it
worked
extremely
effectively,
your
honor.
and,
obviously,
you
do
the
balancing.
i'm
just
the
advocate
here.
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
say
is
there
any
real
benefit
here
compared
to
these
burdens?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
number
of
people
who
are
adversely
affected
is
part
of
the
analysis.
but
if
you
come
in
and
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
essentially
no
real,
significant
benefit
from
making
all
of
these
other
people
who
have
ids
show
them,
then
the
balance
comes
out
that
you
throw
the
law
out.
that's
the
way
the
analysis
works.
