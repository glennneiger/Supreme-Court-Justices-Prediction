g.

you
don't
really...
i
mean,
that's
what
i
wonder
if
there
is
no
such
evidence.
how
could
you
get
evidence?
it
used
to
be
common
maybe
urban
legends,
but
of
political
bosses
voting
whole
graveyards
of
dead
people.
all
right.
now,
that
would
be
almost
impossible
to
catch,
i
think.
someone
walks
in,
saying:
i'm
joe
smith.
he
doesn't
say:
i'm
joe
smith
dead.
he
says,
i'm
joe
smith,
and
he
signs
something.
and
the
poll
worker
looks
at
it
and
the
signature
looks
very
weird.
well,
what's
the
poll
worker
supposed
to
do?
he's
not
going
to
go
disrupt
the
election.
and
is
there
going
to
be
a
policeman
there
to
follow
this
person
home?
of
course
not.
so
that's
their
claim.
their
claim
is
that
we
have
a
lot
of
anecdotes
and
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
fraud
that
you
really
just
can't
catch
at
the
poll.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
because
that's
their
argument
on
the
other
side.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
there
are
arguments
on
both
sides.
but
at
the
heart
of
this
is
what
was
judge
posner's
claim
and
others
that
this
isn't
the
kind
of
fraud
that
you
can
just
dismiss
and
say
it
never
happens
because
the
person
would
walk
into
the
poll
later
and
try
to
vote.
what
they
are
talking
about
is
what
justice
scalia
was
talking
about,
and
i'm
simply
trying
to
focus
your
answer
on
that
part
of
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
say
that's
because
you
can't
catch
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
would
you
catch
it,
which
is
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you're
worried
about
fraud--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you're
worried
about
fraud,
what
i
don't
understand,
and
i'd
like
to
track
it
through
with
you,
is
the
registration
system.
as
i
read
the
indiana
voter
registration
application,
all
a
person
has
to
do
to
register
is
to
write
in,
enclose
a
utility
bill
that
has
his
name
and
address,
and
if
he
doesn't
have
a
photo
id,
he
can
write
the
four
numbers
of
his
social
security;
and
if
he
doesn't
have
that
either
he
doesn't
have
to
do
anything,
and
they
will
give
him
a
number...
and
you
mail
it
in.
and
you're
registered.
so
all
a
person
who
have
to
do
if
he
wants
to
be
fraudulent
is
make
out
a
fraud
one
of
those,
and
he
has
a
photo
id;
he
can
go
to
the
polls.
so
my
question
to
you
is
this:
given
that
system
of
registration,
focusing
on
the
issue
before
us,
why
don't
you
just
say
and
we'll
give
to
you...
you
put
on...
if
you
don't
have
a
photo
id,
we'll
give
you
one.
now
there
it
would
not
stand
as
an
obstacle;
that
apparently
is
what
georgia
has
done.
and
it
doesn't
require
people
to
go
out
and
spend
$10
or
$5
or
something
digging
up
their
birth
certificate,
which
if
you
tried
to
do,
is
quite
a
job
for
many
people.
and
therefore,
you'd
have
all
the
things
you
want.
all
you
would
do
is
with
the
43,000
people
who
don't
have
the
ids,
you'd
say
we'll
get
you
one.
no
big
deal.
you
have
a
photo
machine
there
when
they
come
in
to
register;
they
have
to
go
down;
you
take
a
picture
of
them
and
you
hand
it
to
them.
and
i
would
think
that
that
less
restrictive
way
would
satisfy
your
anti
fraud
interests
far
better
than
the
way
you've
chosen,
but
i
leave
my
judgment
out
of
it.
i
just
would
like
you
to
talk
through
why
that
isn't
a
less
restrictive
way,
which
is
far
better
in
achieving
your
anti
fraud
interests,
or
at
least
as
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
are
going
to
give...
all
we
are
doing
is,
we
will
give
you
the
photo.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
validity.
that
photo
proves
that
mr.
smith
who
comes
in
and
asks
for
it
is
the
same
mr.
smith
who
registered
to
vote.
and
that's
all
your
system
does
in
the
first
place.
so
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
arguing
about
that.
i'm
saying
your
whole...
i'll
repeat
it
once
more.
i'm
saying
your
whole
system
is
a
system
designed
to
assure
that
the
person
at
the
voting
booth
is
the
same
as
the
person
who
registers.
i
accept
that,
absolutely
right.
and
i'm
simply
saying
given
that,
why
didn't
you
say
mr.
proto...
mr.
likely,
like
to
register:
"come
in.
"
"if
you
don't
have
a
photo
id,
we
will
give
you
one.
"
now,
what's
the
objection
to
that?
