mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
any
system
of
voting
that
involves
registrations
or
precincts
will
necessarily
require
some
mechanism
for
ascertaining
a
voter's
identity.
accordingly
petitioners
cannot
take
issue
that
the
constitutionality
of
some
mechanism
for
ascertaining
voter
id.
and
i
take
it
from
today's
argument
that
they
would
concede
the
constitutionality
of
a
signature
match
requirement.
likewise,
nobody
can
really
dispute
the
proposition
that
a
government
issued
photo
id
is
an
awfully
good
way
of
verifying
someone's
identity.
so
the
dispute
really
boils
down
to,
in
a
system
where
the
states
can
legitimately
ask
for
some
kind
of
basis
to
ascertain
id,
can
they
insist
on
a
particularly
good
one,
the
photo
id?
and
we
would
suggest
that
there's
nothing
in
the
first
or
fourteenth
amendments
that
precludes
that
from
happening.
now,
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
this
challenge,
i
think
one
thing
that's
very
evident
from
the
questions
is
this
was
a
challenge
that
was
brought
to
the
statute
on
its
face
and
was
brought
before
there
was
any
enforcement
of
the
statute
or
any
significant
enforcement
of
the
statute.
now,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
there's
a
better
way
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
these
statutes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
mean
i
can
understand
that
you're
concerned
with
that
aspect
of
the
statute
and
the
fact
that
you
can't
execute
an
indigency
affidavit
in
the
polling
place.
i
don't
know
why
that's
a
basis
for
a
facial
challenge
though.
in
particular,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
plaintiffs,
the
individual
members,
if
they
are
members
of
the
indiana
party
that
have
been
identified,
they've
certainly
identified
people
who
do
not
have
the
id
currently.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
were
specific
as
to
whether
they
were
indigent
or
not.
i'm
not
sure
the
individuals,
the
nine
individuals,
were
really
parsed
out
that
way.
and
i
would
think
the
far
better
way
to
go
about
dealing
with
that
issue
is
to
take
as
a
starting
point...
i
mean
you
pointed
out
that
there
were
32
provisional
ballots
cast
in
the
marion
county
election.
now,
i
gather
from
the
state
that's
something
like
0.02
percent
of
the
ballots
cast.
so
it
suggests
that
this
is
not
a
monumental
problem,
but
those
32
provisional
ballots
seem
to
me
to
be
32
possible
plaintiffs
with
a
much
more
concrete
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--than
anything
we
have
before
us.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and,
justice
ginsburg,
i
mean
i
see
your
concern,
and
i
think
if
we
had
an
as
applied
challenge
that
wasn't
this
kind
of
grab
bag
challenge
that
looks
at
all
the
various
different
classes
of
people
that
might
be
adversely
affected,
if
we
had
a
challenge
that
focused
on
that
particular
issue,
i
would
imagine...
i
don't
know
for
sure...
i
would
imagine
that
the
state
would
probably
put
on
some
evidence
that
says,
look,
there's
a
reason
we
did
it
that
way;
we
piggybacked
on
the
general
provisional
ballot
provisions
and
what
we
decided
is
that,
if
we
had
people
executing
indigency
affidavits
at
the
polling
place,
it
would
add
to
the
lines
as
the
the
polls.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
with
respect,
justice
souter,
i
mean
that's
not
the
way
this
challenge
proceeded.
i
mean
there
was
a
challenge
to
everything
under
the
sun,
to
the
whole
sort
of...
this
statute
ab
initio,
and
it
wasn't
something
that
really
put
the
state
on
notice
that
that
was
the
nub
of
the
dispute
and
would
put
evidence
in
the
record
that
might
join
the
issue.
and
again
i
would
say,
of
course,
if
there
were
that
kind
of
as
applied
challenge,
one
of
the
virtues
of
it
would
be
that
the
remedy
at
the
end
of
the
day
would
not
be
to
strike
the
statute
down
on
its
face,
but
it
would
be
an
injunction
consistent
with
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
nayot
that
said,
look,
you
need
to
have...
you
need
to
be
enjoined
to
offer
the
affidavits
at
the
polling
place--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
at
this
point,
like
i
said...
i
mean
we
have
these
32
potential
plaintiffs.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
if
the
claim
could
be
brought
in
sufficient
time,
i
suppose
it
would.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but,
conversely,
nowhere
is
it...
nowhere
is
it
a
rational
assumption
that
all
32
of
these
individuals
has
a
great
claim.
it
may
be
that
some
of
them
are
people
who
just
forgot
their
id--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
for
those
people
i
don't
think
they
have
much
of
a
claim.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
mean
i
think
there's
a
rationale
justification
for
that
which
is
that,
you
know,
if...
especially
if
there
are
only
a
handful
of
these
people,
is
do
you
really
want
to
instruct
every
poll
worker
at
every
precinct
on
how
to
deal
with
this
unusual
situation
or
do
you
want
to
say,
you
know,
that's
sort
of
an
outlying
situation,
let's
instruct
one
poll
worker
at
the
county
elections
office
how
to
deal
with
it?
now,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
you
may
not
be
persuaded
that
that's
the
way
to
do
it.
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
argument,
but
an
as
applied
challenge
could
focus
like
a
laser
beam
on
those
particular
voters
and
those
challenges.
you
could
have
particular
indigent
voters
in
front
of
you.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
preferable
way
to
adjudicate
this
kind
of
claims,
and
i
think
what
this
court
could
do
is
this
court
could
reject
the
facial
challenge
that
is
before
it
here
that
leave
open
the
possibility
of
that
as
applied
challenge,
or
one
could
certainly
imagine
a
veteran
who
has
a
federal
photo
id
without
an
expiration
date
who
comes
into
court
and
says,
look,
it's
irrational
to
make
me
go
get
a
different
form
of
id.
that
as
applied
challenge--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
see
any
reason
why
they
couldn't
be.
i
mean
it
might
depend
a
little
bit
on
the
nature
of
the
challenge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
is
true,
and
there
is
a
provision
for
judicial
review
under
indiana
law,
of
the
provisional
ballots,
if
there's
an
ongoing
dispute.
but
i
also
take
the
point
that
some
of
this
could
be
taken
care
of
well
in
advance
of
the
election,
which
is
actually,
i
think,
a
very
healthy
way
to
deal
with
election
disputes.
and
so
my
hypothetical
veteran
with
the
card,
he
has
got
the
card
in
his
wallet
right
now,
or
her
wallet
right
now.
they
can
go
get--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--you
know,
it
may
be,
justice
stevens,
that
it's
easier
to
get
somebody
to
help
you
out
with
the
federal
case
than
it
is
with
the
second...
with
the
second
affidavit.
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
you
know,
i
think
if
you
look
around
where
there
have
been
these
laws--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
i
think,
if
you
look
where
there
have
been
these
laws,
there
have
been...
the
one
observed
phenomenon
definitely
is
litigation.
so
i
do
think
that
these
claims
will
be
brought.
i
just
really
think
that
in
choosing
the
mode
of
litigation,
you
know,
justice
kennedy
for
the
court
in
the
partial
birth
case
said
that
as
applied
challenges
are
the
basic
building
block
of
adjudication.
and
this
seems
like
a
particularly
appropriate
case
to
apply
that
lesson,
because
i
can
imagine
there--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it's
a
close
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
say
that
i
think
there
is
standing.
i
think
the
standing
that
exists
here
is
the
standing
to
represent
the
nine
or
so
individuals
that
are
addressed
specifically
on
pages
49a
and
51a
of
the
district
court
opinion.
those
are
individuals
who
do
not
have
photo
ids.
i
think
that
as
to
the
membership
issue,
boy,
if
the
indiana
democratic
party
has
any
members,
its
probably
these
individuals,
because
they
are
poll
workers
and
active
in
the
parties.
and
what
i
would
say
about
those
individuals,
though,
is
that
it
is
telling
that
the
only
individuals
they
have
been
able
to
identify
who
don't
have
photo
ids
also
happen
to
be
elderly
individuals
who
can,
by
right,
vote
by
absentee
ballot.
now,
that's
not
to
say...
and
i
would...
i
would
concede
there
is
a
legally
protected
interest
in
voting
in
person
sufficient
to
cross
the
article
iii
threshold.
but
i
think,
when
you
are
looking
for
the
real
world
impact,
it
is
telling
that
the
people
they
have
been
able
to
identify
do
have
a
ready
mechanism
available
to
them.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
may
i
answer
the
question?
you
know,
i
don't
think
that's
relevant
in
this...
i
would
hate
to
think
that
a
party
line
vote
would
necessarily
give
the
other
party
standing
as
a
general
rule.
i
don't
think
that
you
would
adopt
that,
and
this
goes
out
of
the
record,
of
course,
to
a
recent
study.
but
the
one
study
that's
been
done
actually
shows
that
the
democratic
party
did
well
in
the
2006
elections,
and
turnout
went
up
a
little
bit.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again,
if
i
could
answer,
i
mean
i
would
just
say
that,
you
know,
if
this
was
a
cleverly
designed
mechanism
by
the
republican
party
to
disadvantage
the
democratic
party,
at
least
in
2006
it
looks
like
it
went
pretty
far
awry
from
their
perspective.
