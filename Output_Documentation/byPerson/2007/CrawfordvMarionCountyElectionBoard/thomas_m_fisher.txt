mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
any
kind
suggesting
that
400,000
people
in
indiana
lack
this
form
of
identification.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--we've
never
had
a
problem.
in
fact,
that
data
was
submitted
by
the
plaintiffs.
it
came
from
the
bureau
of
motor
vehicles
and
was
matched
against
census
data.
i
don't
think
there's
ever
been
any
dispute
about
the
accuracy
of
the
record.
now,
the
judge
did
acknowledge
that
there
might
be
some
outliers
one
direction
or
another,
but
those
cannot
possibly
account
for
10
times
the
number.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
we
would
say
that
that's
the
number...
that's
the
number
that
could
conceivably
be
inconvenienced
by
this
law.
now,
to
put
that
in
perspective,
i
think
you
have
to
compare
it,
for
example,
to
the
number
of
people
who
are
not
registered
to
vote,
because
there
again
that's
an
incidental
burden.
that
is
something
that
inconveniences
some
people.
and
we're
talking
about
35
times
more...
in
terms
of
a
percentage,
we're
talking
about
66.8
percent
or
so
of
the
population
that
reports
being
registered
to
vote,
far
short
of
the
percentage
based
on
the
calculations
of
the
district
court
or
anything
in
the
ballpark
of
that
that
don't
have
photo
identification.
so
we're
talking
about
an
infinitesimal
portion
of
the
electorate
that
could
even
be,
conceivably
be
burdened
by
this.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
and
at
that
level,
you're
talking
about
less
than
a
half
a
percent
of
the
total
electorate.
this
is...
this
is--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
if
that's
going
to
be
the
case,
then
you're
going
to
have
a
big
problem
with
voter
registration,
which
is
a
far
bigger
problem
for
more
voters.
that
is
a
procedure
that
the
court
has
long
accepted,
has
endorsed
multiple
times,
and
yet
continues--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--the
point
i'm
making
is
that
if
we're
going
to
look
at
the
percent
conceivably
burdened
by
the
law,
then
voter
registration
is
called
into
question.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
democratic
party
argues
against
that.
i
think
in
their
reply
brief
they
accepted
that
that's
a
possible
response.
now,
it's
also
terribly
significant
that
we
don't
have
anybody
in
front
of
this
court
in
this
case
who's
injured
by
this
law.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
agree
with
that.
i
don't
think
that
that...
that
we
take
any
issue
with
that
notion.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
none.
i
think
that
that's
exactly
the
point.
that's
why
we
argue
there's
no
standing.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
case.
and
if
you
look
back
at
marston,
the
voter
registration--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
i
hope
not.
but
i
think
that
the
court
has
shown--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--right.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
terribly
significant,
because
if
you
have
an
as
applied
challenge--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--as
to
an
as
applied
challenge?
i
don't
know
why
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
think
it
could
be
pre
enforcement
and
as
applied
in
a
way
that
could
have
ultimately--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i'm
sorry.
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
should
hope
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
with
respect,
your
honor,
for
all
we
know,
those
may
have
been
fraudulent
ballots.
it
may
well
be
the
case
that
all
32
did
not
show
up
to
validate
their
votes
are
fraudulent.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
and
that
goes
back
to
how
we
would
know,
because
without
an
id
check,
it's
impossible
to
detect
this
kind
of
fraud.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
because
i
think
we
want
to
have
an
idea
that
has
some
integrity
to
it.
i
mean,
this
is
a
balancing
test
that
the
legislature
itself
went
through,
which
is
to
say
they
wanted
to
adopt
a
form
of
identification
that
might
be
effective
and
has
been
proven
effective
and
has
been
accepted
the
world
over
as
the
standard
form
of
identification.
and--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i
think
again
that
we,
on
the
front
end
part
of
it
is
we
are
hamstrung
on
how
we
can
regulate
voter
registration,
in
part
by
the
national
voter
registration
act.
let
me
just
make
that
part
of
it
clear.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
think
in
part
it's
the
administrative
apparatus.
i
mean,
we
are
buying
into...
right
now
into
a
system
that
already
exists,
and
in
fact
with
voter
registration
at
the
dmv
as
it's
required,
in
many
ways
that
is
what
we
have.
you
go
to
the
dmv
anyway
for
other
things.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
no,
we
don't.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
think
there
are
problems
with
that.
that...
that
was
a
different
battle--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--no.
i
think
that's
the
main
point
here,
which
is
it's
at
that
point
where
the
ballot
is
being
cast,
which
is
where
we
want
identification,
and
where
we
want
to--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
we...
well,
i
think
we
may
very
well,
but
i
think
the
policy--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
i
think
the
policy
struck
nationally,
under
the
motor
voter,
is
to
have
an
easy
registration
system,
so
that
it
may
be
problematic
to
introduce
additional
limits.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
the
theory
is
easy--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
and
tough
to
cheat,
hopefully,
is
the
backside
of
that,
which
is
what
the
idea
is
trying
to
do.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
that...
that
part
of
the
responsibility
there
does
lie
again
with
the
national
voter
registration
act
which
limits
how
we
may
maintain
those
lists.
the
problem
has
grown
since--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--there
may
be...
there's
part
of
it
is
the
responsibility
on
our
end,
but
part
of
it
is
also
the...
the
hoops
we
have
to
jump
through
pursuant
to
the
national
voter
registration
act,
and
we've
got
a
situation
unfortunately
where
with
inflated
voter
lists,
with
reports
of
fraud
around
the
country,
the
general
assembly
is
generally
concerned
about
voter
confidence
and
the
legitimacy
of
elections,
and
that's
precisely
what
this
law
is
trying
to
target.
trying
to
reassure
voters--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--we
are
among
the
most
inflated.
i
can't
give
you
precise
ranking
but
the
expert
that
we
brought
forward
said
we
are
among
the
most
inflated.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
that's
right,
and
we
are
taking
those
steps.
now
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that...
that
the
parties
to
the
consent
decree
at
the
state
level,
while
they
can't
identify
individuals
who
have...
have
dormant
registrations,
and
they
can
send
those
names,
names
that
can
be
canceled
to
the
local
authorities,
the
local
authorities
are
under
no...
no
responsibility
under
the
consent
decree
or
otherwise
to...
to
cancel
those.
and
in
fact
the
expert
report
that
we
had
indicated
that
there
were
a
number...
in
1998,
i
think...
a
number
of
duplicates
and
decedent
registrations
that
were
sent
to
the
local
authorities,
only
30
percent
of
which
were
canceled.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
it's
part
of
it,
is--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
i
think
the
larger
point
is
that
when
we've
got
a
situation
where
there
is
an
obvious
gap
in
security
at
the
polls,
where
the
public
expects
to
show
id...
and...
as
they
would
in
any
ordinary,
everyday
situation...
that
is
going
to
create
a
lack
of
confidence,
particularly
when
combined
with
what
we
have
ended
up
with.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
not
explicitly.
that
is
true;
that's
part
of
the
argument,
but
the
other
part
is
that
there
is
a
reasonable
and
obvious
step
to
take
to
ensure
that
there
is
no
fraud
at
the
polls.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
we
are
limited
even
at
that
by
the
nvra.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
but
i
am
saying--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--consistent
with
the
nvra,
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
no,
not
at
all--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--no,
that's
not
my
theory.
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--who...
right,
and
who
would
have
to
pay
a
fee
to
get...
to
get
the
id.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
that's
right.
anybody
who--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
and
who
can
also
vote
absentee
without
id.
but
anybody
who
forgets
their
identification
on
election
day,
for
example,
would
have
to
go
through
the
same
process,
where
they
would
cast
a
provisional
ballot
and
then
have
to
return
to
the
clerk
with
in
10
days.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
or
a
nonindigent
person
who
doesn't
have
id
but
then
needs
to
go
to
the
dmv.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
let
me
do
point
out
one
category
where
there
are
some
reasonable
alternatives.
with
respect...
in
indiana...
with
respect
to
the
elderly
who
can
swear
that
they
were
never
issued
a
birth
certificate,
there
is
an
alternate
means
of
identification,
but
that's
the
only
category.
the
other
thing
we
run
into
is
the
real
id
act.
if
indiana
wants
to
have
an
identification
card
that
can
be
acceptable
in
federal
facilities,
it's
going
to
have
to
have
minimal
criteria
for
issuing
those
photo
identifications.
and
so
i
think
with
respect
to
that,
it
would
not
be
permissible
to
get
around
a
birth
certificate,
which
is
kind
of
a
foundational
document.
i
mean
there
are
alternatives,
such
as
a
passport,
but
i
don't...
you
know,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
that's
necessarily
going
to
be
easier
than
it
is
to
get
a
birth
certificate.
it's
just
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
yes.
and
it...
it's
worth
bearing
in
mind
that
this
form
of
identification
is
necessary
to
do
so
many
everyday
activities,
and
it's
not
as
if
the
state
of
indiana
went
out
and
created
an
entirely
new
system
to
impose
on
the
entire
electorate,
that
everybody
would
have
to
start
from
square
one.
the
vast
majority
of
voters
are
already
in
compliance
with
this
law,
and
the
decision
of
the
general
assembly,
that
it
is
a
reasonable
step
to
take
for
a
measure
of
election
security
to
bring
the
state's
voting
system
into
the
21st
century
and
to
require
the
same
photo
identification
that
you
have
to
show
typically
to
get
on
an
airplane,
to
get
into
many
federal
courthouses,
is
a
reasonable
step
in
the
right
direction
to
preserve
voter
confidence.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
thank
you.
