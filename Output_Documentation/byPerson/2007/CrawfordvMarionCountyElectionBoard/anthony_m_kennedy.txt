justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
think
it's
hard
to
confine
your
rationale
if
you
say
that
any
association
could
sue.
if
it
says,
you
know,
there
are
people
that
if
they
knew
what
we
were
doing,
if
they
knew
this
problem
they
would
really
want
us
to
sue
on
their
behalf,
i
don't
know
if
i'm
going
to
confine
your
rationale.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
clearly
you
answer
all
of
those
questions
that
you've
just
posed,
that
you've
just
responded
with,
"no".
so
then
your
answer
to
justice
alito
should
be
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
although
that
leads
to
the
next
question,
is
whether
or
not
there
are
ways
in
which
the...
the
central
purpose
of
this
law
can
be
preserved
but
it
could
be
less
stringent.
but
i'd
like
you
to
respond
to
both
of
those
things.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
wasn't...
that
wasn't
the
problem
i
had
with
your
answer
to
that
question.
you
posed
a
number
of
questions
to
justice
alito,
or
a
number
of
responses,
but
to
each
one
of
those
your
own
answer
in
the
brief
was
no,
and
therefore
your
question...
the
answer
to
justice
alito's
question
should
be
no,
there
is
no
system
that
you
know
of
that
can
impose
a
photo
id.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
answer
is
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
even
so
is,
there
anything
that
prohibits
the
state
from
confirming
the
validity
of
the
registration
at
the
polling
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
thought
that
the
birth
certificate
requirement
for
indigent
people
was...
was
burdensome,
are
there
any
states
that
have
alternates
to
birth
certificates?
do
neighbors
come
in
and
testify
that
this
is
the
person?
and
i
was
going
to
ask
the
petitioners'
counsel
if
there's
some
areas
where
this
statute...
where
the
central
purpose
and
the
central
function
of
this
statute
can
be
preserved
but
there
can
be
some
reasonable
alternatives
for
people
who
have
difficulty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
did
that,
i
assume
challenges
could
be
made
in
advance
of
the
election.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
invalidate
a
statute
on
the
ground
that
it's
a
minor
inconvenience
to
a
small
percentage
of
voters?
