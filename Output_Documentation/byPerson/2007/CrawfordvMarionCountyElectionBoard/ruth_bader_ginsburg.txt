mr.
smith--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--suppose
at
the
time
of
registration
there
was
a
photograph
taken
right
in
the
registration
place
and
on
the
spot
they
gave
you
an
id
with
that
photo,
and
everybody
who
registers
would
get
one
and
there
isn't
any
question
of
paying
money
to
get
a
birth
certificate.
would
that
be
satisfactory?
ir
that...
if
you
could
make
a
photographic
id
universally
available,
you
would
still
have
the
problem
of
the
religious
objectors,
but
wouldn't
everybody
else
be
covered?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
could,
you
could
do
it
twice.
you
could
make
the
two
trips,
one
to
your
local
place
and
one
to
the
distant
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand,
they
were
going
to
have
some
years
in
between
when
their
proposal
was
enacted,
and
they
were
going
to
have
a
mobile
unit
going
around
to
all
the
neighborhoods,
lots
of
advertising,
because
a
premise
of
that
carter-baker
report
was
that
everybody
would
easily
and
costlessly
get
this
photo
id.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is
not
the
case
that
you
are
confronting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
the
reason
they
are
bringing
a
facial
challenge
is
because
the
horse
is
going
to
be
out
of
the
barn.
they
will
have
the
election,
and
just
what
they
are
afraid
of
could
happen,
that
the
result
will
be
skewed
in
favor
of
the
opposite
party,
because
there
are
people
who
have
not
been
able
to
vote.
so,
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
what
is
the
impact
of
this,
they
are
in
this
bind
after
the
election...
well...
they've
always...
already
lost
that
one.
now,
there
is
something
in
the
briefs
that
happened
after
this
case
was
instituted,
but
we
know
from
marion
county
that
there
were
34
people
who
were
not
able
to
have
a
vote
counted.
and
of
those
34,
only
two
ended
up
qualifying
after
the
fact.
so,
we
know
that
in
that
one
particular
county,
most
of
the
people
who
were
unable
to
satisfy
the
requirement
initially
ended
up
not
satisfying
it.
is
that...
i
mean
that's
not
hypothetical.
that's
real.
but
it
does
give
you
some
confirmation
that
it
isn't
mere
speculation
that
there
are
going
to
be
many
people
who
will
not...
whose
vote
will
not
count.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
the
same
board
that
said
in
all
our
experience,
in
all
of
our
memory,
there
has
never
been
an
impersonator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
indiana
stack
up
against
other
states
in
the
inflation
of
the
voter
rolls?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
are
under
a
consent
decree
to
do
something
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
aspect
of
your
system...
i
know
your
time
is
about
to
expire...
but
it
seems
to
me
that
every
indigent
person
in...
who
doesn't
have
a
photo
id
is
put
to
a
burden
that
the
mass
of
voters
are
not
put
to...
that
is
either
the
two
step
process
and
not
going
to
my
local
precinct,
but
having
to
go
to
the
county
courthouse.
that
burden
is
on
every
indigent
person
who
doesn't
have
a
photo
id,
so
we
are
not
speculating
about
numbers.
that
would
be
true
for
every
indigent
person
who
doesn't
have
photo
id,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
can
go
home
and
get
the
identification
and
go
back
to
their
precinct;
that's
what
the
indigent
can't
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
do
that,
general
clement,
i'd
like
to
you
to
concentrate
on
the
one
group
of
people
where
i
think
you
can
make
a
facial
challenge
and
may
not
all
speculating,
and
that's
the
indigent
people
who
can't
get...
don't
have
the
photo
id.
they
don't
drive,
and
they
can't
get
up
the
money
to
get
the
birth
certificate
or
whatever
else.
they
do
have
a
burden
that,
it
seems
to
me,
the
state
could
easily
eliminate
if
they
want
those
people
to
vote,
and
that
is
to
say
okay,
do
the
affidavit,
the
whole
thing
in
your
local
precinct;
we'll
make
it
easy
for
you
and
not
send
you
away,
send
you
off
to
the
county
courthouse
to
get
it
validated.
why...
why,
if
you
really
wanted
people
to
vote,
wouldn't
you
do
it
that
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--just
on...
just
on
that
one
class
of
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
not
going
to
change
after
the
election.
i
mean
here
is
a
group
of
people
who
are
being
put
to
a
burden
of
going
someplace
else.
and
my
only
question
is,
why
couldn't
the
system
make
it
easy
for
them
if
we
really
want
to
help
america
to
vote,
all
americans,
and
say
we'll
do
it
in
the
local
precinct,
somebody
will
be
there
to
help
you
fill
out
the
affidavit,
instead
of
doing
it
in
a
way
that's
really
going
to
discourage
people
from
voting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
not
concentrating--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
was
trying
to
deal
with
this
one
category
of
person,
and
the
state...
it
was
addressed,
and
the
state
said,
well,
we
can't
do
it
that
way
because
that
will
lead
to
congestion
at
the
polling
place.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
powerfully
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
claim
that
there
are
so
few
of
these
people
it's
not
really
a
problem.
if
there
are
so
few
of
them,
then
i
don't
understand
why
they
should
be
put
to
the
burden
of
going
someplace
other
than
the
polling
place.
