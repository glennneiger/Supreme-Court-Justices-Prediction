let
me
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
question
because
i
think
your
brief
really
goes
astray
on
that.
think
of
the
many
situations
like
the
remainderman
who
is
the
trustee.
he
has
to
look
out
for
the
interests
of
the
live
tenant,
but
he's
going
to
keep
all
the
rest,
so
maybe
he
wants
to
be
economical.
that's
not
saying
that
he
is.
so
i've
always
understood
that
the
term
"conflicting
interests"
means
just
that;
you
have
conflicting
interests.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
necessarily
slide
over
into
misconduct.
and
i
think
that
if
you
would
keep
that
separation
in
mind,
is
there
a
conflicting
interest?
yes,
there
is.
has
the
trustee
in
fact
slipped
and
taken
unfair
advantage
because
of
the
conflicting
interests?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you
come
to
the
end
of
the
line.
you
have
to
prove
that
the
authority
was
misused.
and
as
i
understand
the
sixth
circuit's
decision,
what
those
judges
were
doing,
they
say
we're
going
to
look
at
this
with
some
skepticism
because
of
the
conflict.
and
let
me
give
you
a
concrete
example.
this
woman
got
social
security
disability
benefits
and
she
did
it
at
the
suggestion
of
metlife
is;
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
got
a
lawyer
that
they
recommended
that
she
have.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
point
is
they
came
to
her
and
said:
get
social
security
disability
benefits.
now,
to
get
those
she
would
have
to
show
that
she
is
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
here
is
a
company
that
says:
tell
the
u.s.
government
that
you
are
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
but...
and
then
we'll
recoup
all
that
money
that
we
paid
out
to
you;
but
then
when
we
get
a
chance
to
look,
look
it
over,
we'll
say
you're
not
disabled.
why
isn't
it
appropriate
to
regard
just
that
set
of
circumstances
with
suspicion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i'm
not
questioning
that
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
sounds
fine.
it's
a
question
of
why,
after
helping
her
tell
the
government
that
she
was
totally
disabled,
they,
after
the
initial
two-year
period,
turned
around
and
said
she's
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
these
facts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
the
trier...
i
mean
erisa,
yes,
it
certainly
says
you
can
be
both
the
plan
administrator
and
the
payor,
but
all
it
says
is
that
that's
permissible.
but
it
also
provides
for
review
of
those
decisions,
judicial
review
in
court.
and
here
is,
say,
a
district
court
is
looking
at
it
and
says:
i
don't
understand
why
the
company
didn't
look
at
the
doctor's
explanation
and
put
such
heavy
weight
on
a
checkmark.
and
i
also
don't
understand
the
suggestion
that
she
is
totally
disabled
to
the
government
and
then
saying,
well,
she's
really
not,
in
this
very
close
time
frame.
so
it
might
be
okay
and
it
might
not.
i
am
in
equipoise
about
this
case,
not
the
terms
of
the
plan
but
the
decision
that
was
made
to
deny
her
benefits.
so
which
way
do
i
call
it?
that's
the
question
that
justice
souter
posed,
and
you
seem
not
to
want
to
face
up
to
it
and
answer
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
that
bear
on
making
a
determination
that
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--employee...
that
the
plan
administrator
has
to
make:
is
this
person
disabled
and
is
she
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where,
where
is
this
decision
from
that
you're--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
one
feature
of
this
that
i
don't
understand.
it
was
referred
to
very
swiftly
in
judge
merritt's
separate
opinion.
he
said
at
one
point
there
was
a
proposal
by
metlife
that
they
give
this
woman
a
trial
run
at
a
sedentary
job
to
see
if
she
could
do
it.
and
he
said
that
that
made
a
lot
of
sense
to
him,
and
it
was
metlife's
proposal,
but
then
it
got
withdrawn.
could
you
clarify
what
that
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
did
metlife
withdraw
that
proposal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
was
not
what
dr.
patel
said,
but
how
did
that
proposal
get
dropped?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
would...
how
would
you
verbalize
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
everybody
talks
about
yes,
it's
a
factor,
it's
a
relevant
factor.
but
if
you
are
writing
an
opinion
to
give
clear
instructions
to
the
district
judges
who
are
the
first-instance
judicial
decisionmakers,
what
do
you
tell
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we
look
at
firestone,
it's
rather
laconic.
it's
just
says...
it
says,
ordinarily,
if
you
don't
have
this
discretionary
authority,
it's
de
novo
review.
and
then...
this
is
on
page
115.
it
says
if
the
fiduciary
has
discretionary
authority
to
determine
eligibility
benefits,
then
it's
not
de
novo.
and
what
more
does
it
say?
i
don't
see
that
it
says
anything
more
than
that.
