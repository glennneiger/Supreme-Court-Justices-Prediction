justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
going
to
let
you
answer
this
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
want
you
to
work
mine
in
if
you
can.
the
problem
that
i'm
having
is
what
to
say
in
the
opinion.
now,
could
i
say
this?
firestone,
yes,
that's
the
way
to
put
it
as
a
standard.
you
can
also
teach
through
example.
so
i
look
at
this
case,
i
say:
you
want
to
know
what
that
means,
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion;
it's
perfect.
okay?
so
i've
got
firestone...
my
opinion
so
far
is
two
words:
"firestone,
perfect".
now,
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
other
than
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
know
what
to
look
to
in
trust
law.
i
mean,
all
that's
happened
here,
every
life
insurance...
every
company,
every
life
insurance
company
has
the
kind
of
conflict
that
you're
talking
about.
every
company
has
the
kind
of
conflict
you're
talking
about.
and
an
automobile
company
might
make
shoddy
merchandise
so
it
can
make
more
money
in
the
short
run.
how
does
trust
law
keep
that
kind
of
conflict?
now,
it
can't
be
and
it
isn't,
because
i've
looked
it
up,
i
think,
that
trust
law
says
that
every
distribution
by
a
trustee
whose
own
fee
depends
on
the
size
of
the
trust
is
conflicted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
doubt,
since
banks
are
trustees,
i
doubt
but
i'm
not
sure
here...
3--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
banks
are
trustees...
suppose
you
were
to
say,
look,
the
bank
has
an
interest
in
maximizing
the
amount
of
money
in
its
account
and
therefore
every
decision
of
a
distribution
of
such
trustee
is
subject
to
some
special
thing.
now,
the
problem
for
me
in
this
case
is
what
in
trust
law
do
i
analogize
it
to,
not...
i
don't
doubt
for
a
second
the
26
law
professors,
et
cetera...
though
i
do
really
sometimes,
but
not
in
this
case.
[laughter]
the...
the...
so
what
do
i
look
to?
and
where
i
ended
up
was
i'd
like
an
answer
to
what
i
asked
the
other
side.
i
ended
up,
i
can't
do
better
than
firestone,
i
ought
to
write
two
words
in
this
opinion,
and
the
standard,
perfect;
from
the
opinion
below,
perfect.
you
want
to
know
what
i
mean,
read
the
opinion
below.
okay?
now,
what's
your
view
on
all
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
overstated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
take
the
examples
that
i
gave.
it's
an
ordinary
insurance
policy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's,
you
see,
their
point.
their
point
is
this
is
just
an
ordinary
insurance
company,
an
ordinary
policy,
and
it's
really
like
a
bank
that's
a
trustee
that
in
fact
takes
money
that
hasn't
been
distributed
and
puts
it
on
its
own
account.
they
make
money
for
that,
from
that.
so
there
is
a
conflict.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
that
kind
of
conflict.
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
bank
makes
its
money
by
putting
money
in
an
account,
paying
interest
and
lending
it
at
more
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
chase
manhattan
bank
has
$14
trillion
in
trust
accounts,
and
if
they
just
put
in
for
three
days
money
into
an
interest-bearing
account
and
lend
it
out
for
5
minutes,
they
will
make
$1
billion.
okay.
you
see,
they
are
finding
these
kinds
of
conflicts
everywhere.
and
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
what
i
think
if
i
were
to
add
something
i'd
say,
look
at
this
carefully,
judge,
look
at
it
carefully;
but
if
all
you
find
is
an
ordinary
insurance
company
doing
ordinary
work
and
there
is
no
ground
for
suspicion,
proceed
to
step
two.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
an
example
in
trust
law
where,
say,
a
bank's
a
trustee
and
they
self-insure
in
some
area?
is
there
ever
a
case
in
trust
law
that
found
that
to
be
a
conflict.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
you
can
easily
transpose
this
to
other...
trusts
are
run
by
banks
often
that
are
trustees.
they're
huge,
and
they
might
self-insure
in
simple...
in
certain
circumstances,
in
which
case
you
reproduce
something
like
the
conflict
that's
at
issue
here.
and
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
think
that...
my
guess,
but
i
don't
know.
that's
why
i'm
so
nervous.
is
there
any
example
where
that
kind
of
thing
has
ever
been
held
to
be
a
conflict
of
interest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
analogy?
i
agree
with
your
basic
point.
if
i
encapsulate
it,
you
may
or
may
not
agree
with
my
encapsulation.
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
argument
between
learned
hand
and
felix
frankfurter
under
what
"substantial
evidence"
meant.
and
like
learned
hand,
your
side,
i
think,
or
the
first
argument,
wants
to
find
an
absolute
standard,
a
perfect
analogy,
which
frankfurter
said
you
can't
do.
very
well.
what's
worrying
me
is
what
is
the
analogy?
because
you're
not
saying
it's
just
conflict-of-interest
law.
you
are
analogizing
it
to
a
trustee
who
himself
is
a
remainderman.
and
it's
at
that
point
that
i
begin
to
get
off
this
boat
because
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
right
analogy.
now,
you've
looked
through
lots
of
cases.
your
colleague
knows
it
better
than
you,
and
he
hasn't
come
up
with
something
that's
a
better
analogy.
but
do
you
see
what's
bothering
me?
so,
therefore
i'm
back
where
i
started:
two-sentence,
two-word
opinion.
we
did
our
best
in
firestone
and
this
decision
below
is
a
good
illustration
of
how
to
do
it.
what
can
you
add
to
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
first
case
is
metropolitan
life
insurance
v.
glenn
and
has
to
do
with
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
which
we
all
know
as
erisa.
now
that
act
allows
a
person
who
has
--
has
been
denied
health
benefits
or
disability
benefits,
certain
others
under
the
employee
benefit
plan
to
challenge
in
federal
court
the
denial.
in
an
earlier
case
called
firestone
tire
&
rubber,
we
held
that
trust
law
supplies
the
relevant
standard
of
review
when
they
bring
their
lawsuit.
applying
that
law,
we
said
that
when
a
benefit
plan
gives
the
plan
administrator
discretion
to
make
benefits
decisions,
a
court
should
review
the
administrator's
decision,
i
mean
the
decision
denying
health
benefits
say
to
a
worker.
the
court
should
review
it
under
an
abusive
discretion
standard
and
we
said
that
if
the
administrator
is
laboring
under
a
conflict
of
interest,
the
conflict
should
be
weighed
as
a
factor
but
may
conduct
that
abuse
of
discretion
review.
now
in
this
case,
metlife
an
insurance
company
is
both
the
administrator
and
the
insurer
of
the
sears,
roebuck
disability
plan.
so,
it
evaluates
a
worker's
claim,
is
it
right
or
wrong
and
then
if
the
claim
is
right,
as
insurer,
it
pays
the
claim.
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
is
a
conflict
of
interest
and
it
should
be
treated
as
a
factor
in
deciding
whether
metlife's
decision
and
discretionary
decisions
in
denying
permanent
disability
benefits
to
the
respondent
ms.
wanda
glenn
takes
that
conflict
of
interest
into
account.
now,
we
granted
review
to
determine
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
finding
that
metlife
did
have
a
conflict
of
interest
and
we
also
said
if
that's
so
we
will
consider
how
courts
should
account
for
such
a
conflict
on
judicial
review.
since
that
was
the
question,
two
questions
and
the
answer
that
we've
given
is
we
first
conclude
in
the
administrator
of
a
plan
that
both
evaluates
and
pays
the
claim
does
have
a
conflict
of
interest
of
the
kind
that
firestone
mentioned.
it's
quite
clear
when
the
employer
is
administering
and
also
evaluating
the
claim,
paying
the
claim
because
then
every
dollar
the
employee
says,
"i
won't
pay"
is
the
extra
dollar
he
has
in
his
own
pocket.
so,
that's
a
conflict.
the
conclusions
will
be
less
clear
when
it's
an
insurance
company
that's
performing
that
dual
role
because
they
do
have
a
professional
interest
in
fair
claims
evaluation,
that's
insurance
companies
are
in
the
business
of
doing
in
part,
but
although
these
marketplace
pressures
provide
a
reason
why
a
professional
insurer
might
have
a
less
serious
conflict
than
an
employer
would,
we
still
think
that
some
kind
of
conflict
exists.
so,
turning
to
the
question
and
of
how
a
court
should
account
for
the
conflict,
we
simply
apply
firestone's
teaching
and
it
is
just
one
factor
among
many.
we
add
firestone
means
what
it
says
and
firestone
said
it's
a
factor.
that's
what
it
is,
it's
a
factor.
when
judges
review,
the
lawfulness
of
a
denial
of
benefits,
they
all
account
for
many
different
considerations
of
which
is
one,
that's
just
the
third
way
of
saying
what
i've
already
said
twice.
the
factor
may
be
--
account
for
a
lot
more,
where
for
example,
the
administrator
is
an
insurance
company
with
a
history
of
biased
claims
proceeding.
on
the
other
hand,
that
factor
could
account
a
lot
--
for
a
lot
less
where
the
administrator
has
a
history
of
setting
up
internal
procedures
and
checks
that
try
to
minimize
any
financial
incentive
to
deny
claims.
so,
that's
the
best
we
could
do
and
we
look
at
this
case
and
say,
"we
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
got
it
right.
"and
they
said
the
insurance
company
was
wrong
and
should
have
paid
the
money
to
ms.
glenn
and
we
agree
with
her
about
that
and
they
applied
the
proper
standard
then
we
affirm
the
court's
decision.
so
we
have
an
example
here
of
what
we
think
went
right.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined
or
at
least
that's
fairly
--
