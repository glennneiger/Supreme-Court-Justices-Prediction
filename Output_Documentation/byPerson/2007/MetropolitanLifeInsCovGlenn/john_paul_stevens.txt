yes.
but
as
i
understand
your
brief,
you
say
the
conflict
of
interest
is
only
relevant
if
it
affected
the
decision.
but
how
does
the
plaintiff
prove
that
it
affected?
what
sort
of
evidence
would
go
to
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
just
saying
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
have
an
overwhelming
case.
i
don't
think
you'd
need
the
conflict-of-interest
point
in
that
kind
of
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
can
understand
that
in
normal
trust
situations,
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
you're
going
to
prove
an
insurance
company's
particular
claim
adjustment
was
really
motivated
by
a
conflict
of
interest
rather
than
thinking
the
claim
wasn't
valid.
