does
it
have
to
be
just
the
specific
decisions?
suppose
that
the
company
does
not
have
clear
rules
of,
what
do
you
call
them,
firewalls
between
the
profit
side
and
the
claims
processing
side.
would
that
be
enough
to
cause
a
greater,
more
searching
standard
of
review,
say
de
novo?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
you're
saying,
a,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
potential
conflict
is
not
enough;
b,
the
fact
that
there
are
no
procedures
in
the
company
to
ensure
that
the
conflict
doesn't
affect
the
judgment,
that
is
not
enough
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
positing.
does
the
fiduciary
at
least
have
the,
the
burden
of
production
to
show
that
it
has
established
clear
lines
of
demarcation,
firewalls,
whatever
you
call
them,
within
the
company?
does
it
have
at
least
that
obligation
going
forward?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
i
don't
know
what
effect
you're
giving
to
the
fact,
as
the
earlier
questions
have
indicated,
that
there
is
a
structural
conflict.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
to
say
that
it's
irrelevant
that
a
company
does
not
have
procedures
to
insulate
the
profit
section
from
the
claims
processing
section?
i'll
use
those
terms.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
the
insurance
company
shows
or
may
be
required
to
show,
at
least
by
the
burden
of
production,
that
it
has
established
firewalls,
very
careful
procedures,
written
regulations
that
claims
administrators
are
not
to
consult
with
the
people
that
set
policy
and
prices.
does
that
suffice
to
permit,
simply,
abuse
of
discretion
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
there
is
nothing
the
fiduciary
can
do
in
order
to
avoid
intrusive...
highly...
a
high
degree
of
scrutiny
in
review
of
every
close
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
all
insurance
company
claims
adjustors
have
less
deferential
review
than
independent
claims
administrators?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
institute
an
industrywide
rule
differentiating
insurance
companies
from
other--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
an
insurance
company...
i'll
just
repeat
my
earlier
question...
has
done
the
best
that
it
can
do
to
have
a
firewall,
independence
and
so
forth.
does
that
bear
on
whether
or
not
the
less
deferential
standard
of
review
is
invoked?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
makes
no
difference
what...
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
policies
of
the
companies
are
insofar
as
the
standard
of
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
bears
upon
the
question
justice
breyer
asked,
which
we
never
could
get
completely
answered.
can
you
tell
me
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
wrong
here?
