justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
argument
that
i
understood
you
to
make
in
your
brief.
is
that
a
change
from
the
position
you
took
in
your
brief?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
just
get
this
clear?
i
thought
your
position
in
your
brief
was
that
there
has
to
be
a
demonstration
that
the
conflict
had
an
effect
on
the
decision
before
there
is
any
departure
from
the
standard
abuse
of
discretion--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
standard
of
review.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
problem
with
that
is
the
court
needs
to
know
what
the
standard
of
review
is
before
it
gets
to
the
merits.
and
how
is
the
court
going
to
know
whether
conflicting
interests
played
a
role
in
the
outcome
of
a
particular
benefits
determination
without
looking
at
the
merits
of
the
case
unless
there
is
going
to
be
a
lot
of
discovery
about
internal
processes
at
metlife
and
how
you
treat
the
people
who...
who
gets
promoted
among
the
benefits
administrators
and
all
of
that?
and
that's
what
i
don't
understand
about
that
position.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
does
a
reviewing
court
know
how
far
it
can
go
from
the
outer
boundary
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness
when
there
is
a
conflicting
interest?
is
it
always...
and
i
don't
know
how
thin
you
can
slice
these
standards
of
review.
is
it
always,
let's
say
90
percent
of
the
way
to
the
outer
boundary;
or
sometimes
it
would
be
80
percent;
sometimes
it
would
be
70
percent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
it
work
like
that
depending
on
the
facts
of
the
case?
