justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
neither,
neither
does
the
fact
that
there
may
be
dual
capacities
eliminate
the
fact
that
there
are
contrary
tugs
on
the,
the
individual
or
the,
or
the
organization
that
has
the
dual
responsibilities,
and
there's
no
reason
that
the
law
should
be
blind
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
let's
assume...
let's
assume
that
i'm
reviewing
it,
and
i...
i
don't
find
it
as
clear
as
you
do,
and
i'm
on
the
fence.
being
on
the
fence,
may
i
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
therefore
i
will
say,
okay,
i
wouldn't
know
for
sure
how
to
go
in
this
case,
but
i
see
the
conflict
of
interest
and
that's
enough
to
make
me
say
more
probably
than
not
there
was
a
reflection
of
the
self-interest
of
the
provider,
rather
than
the
interest
of
the...
of
the
insured
here;
and,
therefore,
i'm
going
to
find
that
the...
that
the
conflict
did
disadvantage
the
person
insured.
that
would
be,
i
take
it
on
your
view,
a
reasonable
application
of
firestone.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
just
told
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
just
told
you
how
it
weighed.
i'm
sitting
on
the
fence.
i'm
not
sure
what
to
do.
i
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
there
is
conflicting
interest
here;
and,
therefore,
i
conclude
that
the
conflicting
interest
is
the
reason
for
the
decision
and
i
hold
against
the
company.
is
that
a
misapplication
of
firestone?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
my
hypothetical
is
the
hypothetical
of
the
person
making
the
decision.
i
put
myself
in
that
person's
position
and
i'm
saying
i
can
think
of
reasons
that
might
result
in
concluding
that
this
was
a
reasonable
decision,
period.
and
i
can
think
of
reasons
that
might
result
in
concluding
that,
in
fact,
this
was
a
decision
that
had
been
made
against
the
interest
of
the
insured
because
the
person
making
the
decision
itself
had
an
interest
in
it.
i'm
not
sure
which
way
to
go,
but
i
now
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
there
was
this
conflicting
interest
in
the
person
or
the
organization
that
made
the
decision,
and
for
that
reason,
i
am
going
to...
i'm
going
to
break
the
tie,
and
i'm
going
to
conclude
that
the
conflict
was
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
insured.
i'm
going
to
rule
against
the
company.
i
understood
that
you
said
that
would
be
a
proper
application
of
firestone.
is
that
still
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
in
my
hypothetical,
i've
taken
into--
justice
david
h.
souter
--factors
that
say
the
company
was
right,
factors
that
say
the
company
is
wrong.
i'm
not
sure
which.
they
seem
evenly
balanced
to
me,
until
i
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
there
was
conflicting
interest,
and
i
say
that's
enough
to
tip
it.
and
it
does
tip
it,
and
i
rule
against
the
company.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
am
i
right
or
wrong
under
firestone?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be,
but
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
not
going
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
not
going
to
help
the
appellate
court,
my
friends
here
who
have
to
review
my
decision.
they
want
to
know
whether
i
was
right
or
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr....
mr.
rosenkranz.
i
think
you
set
up
basically
three
different
kinds
of
scenarios.
and
i
want
to
set...
i
want
to
put
them
into
my
own
words
and...
and
have
you
tell
me
whether
i
understand
your...
your
point
correctly.
scenario
number
one
is
the
case...
in
each
of
these
scenarios,
we
have
the
same
relationship
between
the...
in
effect,
the
trustee
and...
and
the
beneficiary
that
we
have
here.
there...
there
is
a...
there
is
a
built-in
conflict.
we
don't
know
what
its
effect
is.
in
scenario
number
one,
the...
the
evidence
is
that
the
person
making
the
benefits
decision
says
let's
let
this
person
suffer
so
that
we
can
keep
the
money.
that
is
the
easy
case.
scenario
number
two--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
right,
the...
the
e-mail
shows
up.
in...
in
case
number
two,
there...
there
is
what
you
referred
to
as
a
decision
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
but
instead
of
being
sort
of
in
the
core
of
the
center
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
it's
close
to
the
edge.
a
decisionmaker
could
look
at
that
decision
and
say
if
there
is
no
reason
to
be
suspicious
about
it,
it's
still
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
a
conflict.
but
if
the
decisionmaker
knows
that
there
is
this
kind
of
structural
conflict,
the
decisionmaker
can
say
look,
i
wasn't
born
yesterday;
the
reason
it's
so
close
to
the
edge
is
that
they
were
giving
way
to
their
own
self-interest
in
the
conflict,
and
i'm
going
to
decide
for
the
beneficiary
and
against
the
company.
case
number
three
is
the
case
of
the
person
right
on
the
fence,
the
decisionmaker.
the
decisionmaker
says,
i've...
i've
looked
at
everything
there
is
to
look
at
and
i
cannot
decide
for
sure
what
this
is,
whether
it
was
a
legitimate
decision
or
a
conflicted
one
in
the...
in
the
decisionmaker's
favor,
unless
i
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
there
is
this
structural
conflict.
justice
david
h.
souter
no
the
decisionmaker
is
the
person
who
made
the
beneficiary...
the
benefits
decision.
and
if
i
take
into
consideration
the
structural
conflict,
that
gives
the
decision
to
the
beneficiary
and
against
the
company.
now,
in
case
number
two,
it's
close
but
the...
but
the
fact
of
the
conflict
is
regarded
as,
itself,
as
substantive
evidence
and
it...
it
results
in
a
decision
for
the
beneficiary.
in
case
number
three,
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise,
and
to
get
off
equipoise,
the
conflict
rule
is
taken
as
the
tiebreaker.
my
understanding
is
that
your
view
is
the
proper
way
to
consider
the
conflict
under
firestone
is,
as
i
did
in
my
hypo,
in
both
case
number
two
and
case
number
three.
am
i
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
when
we
take...
it
is
taken
as
substantive
evidence
to...
to
get
us
out
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness
in
case
number
two.
it
breaks
the
tie
in
case
number
three.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
the
record
has
the
structural
context.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
in
my
hypothetical
you
weren't
at
the
center
of
the
zone
of
reasonable;
you
were
close
to
the
edge.
justice
david
h.
souter
number
three
honor
we
can't
make
up
our
mind.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
you...
i
guess
you
are
saying
it
may
be
considered
as
substantive
evidence
but
it
is
not
a
process
tiebreaker?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
here
are
two
ways
you
could
do
it.
you've
spoken
of
reasonableness
analysis.
by
"reasonableness
analysis",
i
mean
and
i
assume
you
mean
that
the
person
who
is
judging
the
action
taken
says:
here
are
the
good
reasons
on
one
side
that
support
the
action;
and
here
are
the
reasons
on
the
other
side
that
in
fact
are
critical
of
it,
suggest
that
it
was
wrong.
which
one
of
these
sets
of
reasons
is
the
strongest?
that's
what
i
sort
of
mean
by
"reasonableness
analysis".
there
are
two
ways
that
the
structural
conflict
could
be
taken
into
consideration
in
reasonableness
analysis.
one
is
it
could
be
taken
into
consideration
during
this...
we'll
call
it
the
step
one
process.
we
put
the
structural
conflict
on
the...
on
the
side
of
the
scale
that
weighs
against
affirming
the
decision.
a
second
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
go
through
reasonableness
analysis
leaving
the
conflict
aside
for
the
moment,
and
say,
on
regular
reasonableness
analysis,
do
the
reasons
support
the
decision
predominantly
or
do
they
go
against
it,
and
let
it
go
at
that.
but
when
that
kind
of
"reasonableness"
analysis
results
in
something
close
to
equipoise,
then
we
take
the
structural
conflict
into
consideration;
and
that's
what,
in
effect,
sort
of
breaks
the
tie.
which
of
those
models
do
we
use?
do
we
use
the
structural
conflict
as
a
reason
in
the
step
one
weighing,
or
do
we
use
the
structural
conflict
as
a
tiebreaker.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
question
of
when
you
use
it;
and
on
the
first
hypothetical,
you
may
not
have
to
use
it
at
all.
on
the
second
hypothetical,
you
have
to
use
it
because
you
can't
make
a
decision
any
other
way.
so
you're
saying:
use
it
at
step
one
as
one
of
the
substantive
reasons
in
your
weighing
analysis?
