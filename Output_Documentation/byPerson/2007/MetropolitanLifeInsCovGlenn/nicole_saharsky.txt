ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
should
not
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
conflict
of
interest
that
exists
when
an
administrator
both
evaluates
and
pays
claims.
instead,
an
administrator's
discretionary
decisions
should
be
reviewed
for
reasonableness
where
the
conflict
of
interest
is
considered
as
a
factor.
and
what
that
means--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
we
agree
with
the
point
you're
making,
that
the
question
in
all
of
these
cases
is
the
reasonableness,
where
there's
a
discretionary
clause,
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
administrator's
determination.
that
is
the
ultimate
inquiry,
and
there
are
any
number
of
other
facts
and
circumstances
that
could
suggest
that
the
decision
is
unreasonable.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
and
one
fact--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
conflict
of
interest.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
in
very
close
cases.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
this
is
a
standard
that
comes
from
trust
law,
the
reasonableness
standard,
and
this
court
has
recognized
similar
standards
in
all
different
areas
of
the
law
where
they've
talked
about...
where
you've
talked
about
reasonableness
and
abuse
of
discretion
review--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--in
every
case,
the
court
would
need
to
make
a
decision
about
reasonableness,
and
in
the
cases
where
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest
that
needs
to
be
weighed
what
the
court
would
do
is
take
a
close
look
at
the
administrator's
rationale--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--first
of
all,
this
court
should
say
that
firestone
correctly
set
out
the
framework
for
the
de
novo
default
standard
of
review
and
what
should
happen
in
the
case
of
a
discretionary
determination
where
the
plan
confers
discretion--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that
review
should
be
under
the
trust
law
standard.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
both
on
pages
111
and
on
115,
this
court
was
looking
to
the
law
of
trusts.
there's
a
more
extensive
discussion
on
page
111,
where
it
says,
for
example,
"if
the
trustee
is
given
power
to
construe
disputed
or
doubtful
terms,
in
such
circumstances
the
trustee's
interpretation
will
not
be
disturbed
if
reasonable.
"
and
then
on
page
115,
using
that
abuse
of
discretion
reasonableness
standard,
the
court
said
"if
there
is
a
benefit
plan
that
gives
discretion
to
an
administrator
that
is
operating
under
a
conflict,
the
conflict
must
be
weighed
as
a
factor.
"
and
firestone
told
this
court
to
look
to
trust
law
and
trust
law...
we
think
the
best
examples
there
are
the
situations
of
a
trustee
who
is
also
a
beneficiary
or
a
trustee
who
is
also
a
remainderman.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
the
standard
of
review
would
be
the
same,
which
is
review
for
reasonableness,
but--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
standard
of
review
is
the
same,
but
the
outcome
could
be
different
in
that
case
because
what
the
insurance
company
did
should
be
taken
into
account
when
the
court
is
making
a
judgment
call,
the
same
kind
of
judgment
call
that
courts
have
made
in
equity
cases
for
years.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
but--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
sixth
circuit
correctly
determined
that
there
needed
to
be
greater
scrutiny
to...
to
the
claims
determination
in
this
case.
we
would
quarrel
with
the
sixth
circuit's
analysis
calling
that
abuse
of...
or,
i'm
sorry,
arbitrary
and
capricious
review
because
we
don't
think
that
that
analogy
to
administrative
law
makes
sense.
but
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
was
correct
in
this.
there
were
a
number
of
factors
here,
for
example
the
social
security
determination,
metlife's
participation
in
that,
that
has
suggested
that
this
decision
was
unreasonable
and
could
not
be
upheld.
conflict
of
interest
was
a
factor.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
we
think
that
the
answer--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--we
think
that
the
answer
comes
from
trust
law.
we
think
that
the
answer
comes
from
trust
law,
and
these
are
judgment
calls
that
courts
need
to
make--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--about
whether
a
decision
was
reasonable.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's
true,
but
that's
balanced
against
the
strict
fiduciary
duties
in
erisa,
that
in
cases
of
a
conflict
of
interest
suggests
that
the
plan
administrator's
determination
needs
to
get
additional
scrutiny.
i
understand
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
structural
conflict
should
be
used
in
the
weighing
although,
for
the
purposes
of
your
hypothetical,
i
see
the
answer
as
being
the
same
in
both
situations
that
you
posited.
that
the
conflict
of
interest
would
only
make
a
difference
in
close
cases,
yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that,
we
think,
would
be
more
consistent
with
purposes--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--can
i
answer
the
question?
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
the
problem
with
this
inquiry
is
that
reasonableness
does
not
have
mathematical
standards.
it's
a
determination
that
the
court
needs
to
make
weighing
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
conflict
is
one
of
many
factors
like
the
social
security
administration's
determination
and
how
it
was
treated
in
this
case
that
suggests
that
the
plan
administrator's
determination
was
unreasonable.
i
can't
tell
you
that
it
weighs
10
11
percent
or
20
percent
in
every
case.
it
is
something
that
the
court
has
to
take
into
account.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
thank
you.
