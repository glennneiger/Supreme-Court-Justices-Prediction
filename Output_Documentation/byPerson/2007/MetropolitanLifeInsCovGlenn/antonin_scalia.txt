what
do
you
mean
by...
let's
get
straight
by
what
we
mean
by
"in
actuality
conflicted".
isn't
the
fiduciary
who
has
a
financial
interest
in
actuality
conflicted?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
aren't
we
talking
in
this
case
always
about
fiduciaries
who
are
in
actuality
conflicted.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
that's,
that's
a
conflicted
fiduciary
who
allows
the
conflict
to
warp
its
judgment.
but
the
conflict
exists
whether
you,
whether
you
give
it
effect
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
let's
call
that
a
conflicted
fiduciary,
somebody
who
has
two
loyalties,
whether
or
not
he
allows
the
one
loyalty
to
distort
his
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
you
say
you
should
take
it
into
account,
but
if
it
was
a
reasoned
decision,
which
is
the
test
whether
or
not
he's
a
fiduciary,
if
it's
a
reasoned
decision
the
fact
that
he's
a
fiduciary
makes
no
difference,
right?
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
make
a
difference
then.
what
was
a
reasoned
decision
for
someone
who
doesn't
have
a
conflict
becomes
an
unreasoned
decision
simply
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
has
a
conflict?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
posner,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
ought
to
be
looked
at
with
suspicion,
whether
or
not
the
person
making
the
decision
has
a
conflict.
i
mean
that
smells
bad
or
doesn't
smell
bad,
as
you
say,
either
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
am
still...
listen,
i
know
that
we're
responsible
for
this
because
we
said
it
in
firestone.
we
said
that
a
conflict
of
interest
should
be
weighed
as
a
factor.
if
that
means
anything,
it
seems
to
me
it
means
that
sometimes
that
weight
will
make
the
difference.
so
at
least
sometimes...
but
you're
not
willing
to
admit
that...
at
least
sometimes
you
would
say,
oh,
yes,
this
is
a
reasonable
decision
and
had
this
decision
been
made
by
a
fiduciary
without
a
conflict,
it
would
be
perfectly
okay
because
it's
reasonable.
that's
the
test.
however,
since
this
fiduciary
has
a
conflict,
what
was
a
reasonable
decision,
whoof,
the
added
weight,
it
becomes
an
unreasonable
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
you
mean
by
giving
it
some
weight?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
a
perfectly
reasonable
decision
becomes
unreasonable
simply
because
you
have
a
conflict?
justice
antonin
scalia
dictum.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i
don't
like
about
the
dictum
is
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
lovely
to
say
weigh
it
as
a
factor,
it
gets
the
case
off
our
docket
and
it's
fine.
but
what
does
it
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
mean
that
a
perfectly
reasonable
decision
that
is
within
the
discretion...
i
mean
this
plan
says
that
metlife
will
have...
knowing
that
it
will
have
the
conflict,
that
they
will
make
the
decisions
and
so
long
as
they
are
not
arbitrary,
they
are
valid.
now,
let's
take
a
perfectly
reasonable
decision.
it
is
not
arbitrary.
does
giving
weight
to
the
existence
of
the
conflict
which
the
settlor
of
the
plan
expected
to
exist,
does
giving
weight
to
that
mean
that
what
was
reasonable
becomes
unreasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
then
it
means
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
trust
law
doesn't
say.
trust
law
does
not
establish
a
different
standard
of
judicial
review
for
the
conflicted
trustee.
justice
antonin
scalia
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
say
that
one
of
the
things
that
can
make
it
unreasonable
is
the
mere
fact
that
there
exists
this...
this
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
renders
what
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
decision
unreasonable.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
that.
in
very...
what
kind
of
a
standard
is
that,
"in
very
close
cases"?
how
is...
how
are
you
going
to
review
a
court?
i
mean,
give
it
some
weight
in
very
close
cases?
it
slops
over.
this
is
not
a
standard.
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
what
you're
telling
the
courts
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
mind
reasonableness
and
i
don't
mind
abuse
of
discretion.
but
you're
telling
me
that
even
when
the
reasonableness
standard
is
met,
if
there
is
this
conflict,
if
it's
close...
how
close
is
close?
you...
suddenly
it
flops
over
the
edge.
i
mean,
you
know,
close
to
the
out...
it's...
it's
beautiful
art,
but
i
don't
understand
how
it
turns
into
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you're
at
all
saying
that
it's
the
same
standard
of
review.
you
keep
saying
that,
and
your
friend
said
it,
but
it's
not
the
same
standard
of
review.
you
say
it's
still
the
reasonableness
standard
of
review,
but
then
you
say,
however,
the
mere
fact
of
the
existence
of
the
conflict
does
at
the
edges
make
unreasonable
what
used
to
be
reasonable.
that
is
a
different
standard
of
review.
it
means
you
are
not
using
a
single
reasonableness
standard
of
review.
you're
arguing
for
a
second
standard
of
review
that
is
so
vague
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
why
not
just
say
that
the
district
court,
when
there
is
a
conflict
of
this
sort,
has
to
spend
two
more
hours
considering
the
case?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
clear
rule,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you're
going
to
do
that,
you
have
to
tell
me
how
much
it
weighs.
you
see,
if
you
use
it
in
step
two
when
things
are
in
equipoise,
it
doesn't
matter
how
much
it
weighs.
it's
enough
if
it
weighs
a
feather.
in
the
equipoise
case
you
come
out
the
other
way.
but
if
you're
going
to
use
it
in
the
first
structural
system
to
determine,
you
know,
how
much
each
side...
i
have
to
know
its
weight.
and
there
is
no
indication
whatever
as
to
what
its
weight
is.
it's
really
up
to
the
district
judge,
i
guess,
to
decide
how
much
weight
he
is
going
to
give
to
the
fact
that
there
is
this
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
weighing
reasonableness.
i'm
weighing
that
factor
of
the
conflict.
that's
what
you
ask
us
to
weigh.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
reasonableness.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
should
only
use
it
as
a
tiebreaker,
i
suggest,
if
you
can
tell
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
you
just
say?
i
don't
understand
that.
the
conflict
was
intended
by
the
employer.
he
appointed
the--

intended
by
