ms.
amy
k.
posner
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
two
reasons,
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong
to
hold
that
a
company
that
is
an
erisa
claim
fiduciary
and
that
separately
funds
the
plan's
liabilities
must
always
be
deemed
to
be
operating
under
a
conflict
of
interest
that
changes
the
employer's
designated
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
of
review
under
its
plan
document.
and
the
first
reason
is
one
that
we're
on
common
ground
with
and
that
is,
as
this
court
recognized
in
pegram
v.
herdrich,
erisa
explicitly
authorizes
companies
like
metlife
to
fulfill
both
fiduciary
and
nonfiduciary
functions
as
long
as
it
does
not
in
actuality
commingle
those
functions.
the
mere
fact
that
the
potentiality
of
conflict
is
inherent
in
all
of
these
commonplace
dual
arrangements
in
erisa
welfare
benefit
plans
is
not
enough
on
its
own
to
displace
the
employer's
designated
abuse
of
discretion
standard
of
review.
and
secondly--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--no,
your
honor,
it
should
not
be
blind.
and
as
firestone
recognized,
though,
if
in
fact
there
is
a,
an
entity
that
is
in
actuality
conflicted,
a
claim
administrator,
then
that
conflict
doesn't
change
the
standard
of
review.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
we're
using
the
words--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--no,
your
honor.
we
are
using
these
terms
to
designate
in
actuality
a
conflicted
fiduciary
is
one
that
has
been
infected
or
the
decision
was
infected
by
the
conflict.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
is
a
conflict
that
we're
saying
is
a
potential
conflict.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
yes.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
firestone,
your
honor,
when
there
is
an
actual
conflict,
that's--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--that's
exactly
the
distinction
that
we
are
making
by
using
actual
and
potential
or,
as
this
court
said,
possible
and
actual
in
firestone.
and
where
that
slip
occurs
in
trust
law
or
in
erisa
and
it
infects
the
decision,
the
firestone
court--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--i
don't
think
it
would
ever
result
in
a
de
novo
review.
i
think
what
it
is
is
a
factor
that
should
be
weighed
with
all
the
other
factors
that
go
to
the
actual
benefits
decision.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
no.
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
if--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--no,
your
honor,
it
does
not,
and
as
the
united
states--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--that's
a
structural
conflict
that
erisa
anticipates
and,
as
the
united
states
said
in
its
brief
to
this
court
in
pegram
v.
herdrich,
that
erisa
tolerates
this
dual
role
and
this
level
of
conflict
in
order
to
keep
these
plans
that
are
so
vital
in
our
country's
economic
interests
in
underlying
the
employee's
well-being--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--no,
justice
kennedy,
absolutely
not.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
if
there
were
such
a
fiduciary
that
factor
must
be
weighed,
but
it
doesn't
change
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
it
means
again,
remembering
that
these
are
claims
under
29
u.s.c.
1132(a)(1)(b)
for
benefits
due
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
it's
very
important
that
the
courts
remember
to
look
at
the
terms
of
those
plans--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--as,
as
in
trust
law...
and
if
you
look
at
the
cases
in
trust
law,
what
the
court
needs
to
look
at
when
the
settlor,
here
the
employer,
designates
the
discretionary
authority
under
the
terms
of
the
trust
or
the
plan
is
that
that
conflict
comes
into
play
if
it
seems
that
it's
been
breached.
but
you
also
have
to
remember
exactly
what
the
purpose
of
the
trust
is,
and
so
you
need
to
protect
the
employer's
interest
in
having
benefits
paid
in
meritorious
cases
and
not
paid
in
nonmeritorious
cases.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
it
remains
in
the
discretion
because
this
court
said
that
that
freedom
of
contract
that's
so
important
to
erisa,
to
keep
the
benefits,
the
employers
interested
in
offering
benefits--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
certainly
not.
again,
it
must
be
a
factor
that's
weighed
with
the
other
factors.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
yes--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--and
i--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--in
this
case...
and
this
case
i
think
presents
a
very
narrow
question
for
the
court,
and
that
is
where
there
is
the
dual
role
inherent
in
the
plan
but
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
it
infected
the
decision,
if
it
must
be
given
weight
in
answer
to
the
court's
second
question,
then--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--she
actually
applied
herself.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
metlife
recommended
a
lawyer
to
her
and
also
said
she
could
use
her
own
lawyer,
which
was
consistent
with
the
plan
design.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
correct.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
because,
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
that
letter
was
written
to
the
respondent
here
in
october
of
2000,
in
fact
metlife
had
granted
her
benefits.
and
the
action
of
helping
an
employee
perfect
their
entitlement
to
social
security
is
in
fact
not
a
conflict
at
all.
it's
a
fiduciary
obligation
under
the
terms
of
a
plan
and
it
helps
the
employee
as
well.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
when--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--the...
the
reason
is...
and
it's
unfortunate
that
often
social
security
makes
the
same
decision
that
the
plan
fiduciary
has
made
two
years
earlier,
and
the
government
is
looking
backwards
at
certain
evidence
that
may
not
be
before
the
erisa
plan
fiduciary.
the
erisa
plan
fiduciary
at
that
two-year
point
is
looking
at
that
evidence
at
that
time
and
at
a
change
in
the
terms
of
the
plan.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
justice
scalia--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--i
think--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--yes,
justice
scalia--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--but--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--it
depends
on
how
close
that
reasonable
decision
is
to
the
line,
and
in
this
case
the
decision
was
not
one
that
this
mere
dual-role
conflict,
the
lowest
level
of
conflict
that
can
exist,
can
push
that
reasonable
decision
over.
and
i--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--you...
i
think
under
firestone
you
have
to
take
that
into
account.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
again,
depending
upon
how
these
things
weigh.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
yes.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
no,
it
would
not
be.
but--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
the
brief
acknowledges
that
there
are
various
conflicts
that
exist
here.
the
conflict
that
erisa
tolerates
and
recognizes
as
being
everyday,
ordinary
practice
that
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
employee
benefits
of
this
country
to
remain
vital,
and
that
is--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--that's
correct,
justice
alito.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
and
i
took
justice
souter's
hypothetical
to
mean
that
there
had
been
a
conflict
that
seriously
weighed
on
his
view.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
i
think
that
that
could
be.
the
problem
with
all
of
these
cases
and
when
you
look
at
them--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--well,
again,
we're
looking
at
conflict
as
if
it's
the
only
factor
here,
and
when
we
look
at
these
cases--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--you're
saying
that--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--i
think--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--again,
i
think
that
it's
very
important
to
look
at
the
employer's
plan
and
this
employer
specifically.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
the
answer
is--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--the
answer
is
you
could
be
right
or
you
could
be
wrong,
but
it's--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--so
important--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--these
matters
are
so
fact-specific.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
okay,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
your
honor,
the
problem
with
the
hypothetical
as
you
just
stated
is
that
you've
taken
the
employer's
contract
out
of
the
calculation,
and
that
the
employer
has
the
right
to
determine
its
own
plan
and
design
those
plans
as
they
see
fit
in
order
to
keep
these
vital
economic
safety
nets
available,
affordable
and
capable
of
providing
a
safety
net
to
the--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--because--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--you
can't
make
that
determination,
justice
ginsburg,
out
of
the
context
of
the
plan
design.
this
plan
design
says
that
social
security
can
be...
can
be
an
offset,
estimated
or...
or
received.
it
says
that
the
plan
administrator
or
the
fiduciary
not
only
has
discretionary
authority
to
determine
eligibility
for
benefits
and
to
construe
the
terms
of
the
plan,
but
that
its
decision
may
not
be
overturned
unless
arbitrary
and
capricious.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
we
believe
that
it's
the
justice
alito
hypothetical,
where
it
does
play
a
role.
where
it
doesn't
play
a
role,
it
should
have...
our
first
answer...
our
answer
to
the
first
question
is
it
should
have
no
weight.
however,
i
understand
that
we've
moved
beyond
that
to
the
second
question.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
no...
yes,
justice
alito,
and
i
think
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
there.
the
merits
of
the
case
must
certainly
be
scrutinized,
and
they
can
be
scrutinized
for
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
that's
the
important
issue.
it's
scrutinizing
the
merits
of
the
case,
whether
or
not
the
medical
and
vocational
information
supports
the
decision.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
there
are
cases,
your
honor,
where
can
you
see
that,
for
instance,
when
you
look
at
the
medical
evidence,
that
the
administrator
shows
in
its
claim
file,
which,
unlike
any
other
area
of
the
law,
the
whole
process
is
transparent
under
erisa;
and
there
may
really
not
be
any
evidence
that's
supporting
it,
or
so
little
that
it's
hard
to
understand
how
that
fiduciary
could
possibly
have
reached
that
decision.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
that's
actually
the
standard,
though,
justice
stevens,
in
trust
law
also.
because
when
you
read
these
cases
and
you
look
at
the
examples
in
the
restatement,
when
the
trustee
has
an
acknowledged
conflict
and
the
settlor
nevertheless
vests
in
that
trustee
discretionary
authority,
then
in
order
for
a
court
to
displace
that
trustee's
judgment
the
court
must
find
that
the
trustee
actually
acted
from
conflict
and
in
controverse...
in
contraverdia...
oh,
my
goodness...
and
did
not
follow
the
terms
of
the
plan.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
that
is
a
problem,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
you...
you
read
the
cases
and
the
files,
as
i'm
sure
you
have,
and
it's
apparent
that
there
are...
let
me
use
post
v.
hartford
as
an
example,
if
i
may.
in
post
v.
hartford
there
is
a
majority
opinion
that
overruled
the
hartford's
discretion
based
merely
on
minor
irregularities.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
post
v.
hartford,
your
honor,
is
at
501
fed.
3d
154.
it's
the
case
that...
it's
a
third
circuit
case
from
2007
that
the
respondent
very
heavily
relies
upon,
and
it's
a
glaring
example
of
what's
gone
wrong
in
the
analysis
here,
because
in
post
v.
hartford
there's
a
majority
opinion
that
overruled
the
hartford's
discretion
based
on
minor
irregularities,
what
it
called
as
minor
irregularities,
merely
because
they
existed.
the
dissenting
judge
looked
at
the
medicals
and,
even
under
the
third
circuit's
heightened
scrutiny,
which
automatically
it
applies
to
insurance
companies
regardless
of
the
situation,
that
justice
said
the
medical...
that
judge,
sorry...
said
that
the
medical
evidence
very
clearly
supported
the
hartford's
decision.
and
what
we
are
hoping
will
come
out
of
this,
your
honors,
is
that
in
fashioning
what
should
happen
in
these
cases,
that
the
fact
that
these
are
claims
for
benefits
under
the
terms
of
the
plan
must
really
be
important,
not
just
minor
irregularities
and
whether
this
was
done
right
or
that
was
done
right.
that's...
that's
a
cause
of
action
under...
under
1132(a)(2),
and
the
respondents
are
relying
very
heavily
on
the
replacement
of
the
fiduciary,
of
the
trustee.
that's
not
the
issue
here.
that's
an
(a)(2)
claim
under
1109
where
you
could
replace
the
fiduciary.
here
we
are
talking
about
were
these
benefits
properly
denied
or
not?
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--yes.
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg,
that
judge
merritt
was
looking
at
a
provision
of
the
plan
that...
actually,
i'll
tell
you
where
it
is.
it's
at
170a
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
that
provision
allows
rehabilitative
employment
for
a
disabled
person.
in
early
2002,
metlife
did
refer
the
file
to
a
vocational
rehabilitation
specialist
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
respondent
was
eligible
for
that.
in
doing
that,
a
letter
was
sent
to
the
treating
physician,
dr.
patel,
asking
specifically
what
she
could
do
in
an
eight-hour
day;
could
she
do
full-time
sedentary
work;
and
if
there
were
any
physical
barriers.
and
that's
that
march
12th,
2002,
letter...
it
was
not
a
form...
which
he
filled
out
and
said
in
an
eight-hour
day
she
could
sit
for
eight
hours;
she
could
stand
for
four
hours;
and
she
could
walk
for
two
hours;
that
she
could
do
full-time,
sedentary
work,
and
that
there
were
no
physical
barriers
otherwise
blocking
her
ability
to
do
that.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
well,
there
was
no
proposal,
your
honor,
but
it
was
given
to
a
rehabilitation
specialist
to
work
that
up
to
see
if
she
was
disabled
and
eligible
for
rehabilitative
employment,
because
her
treating
physician
responded
to
that
inquiry
by
saying
she
could
do
sedentary
work,
she
retained
that
physical
capacity,
which
was
consistent
with
what
he
said
in
january
of
'02
and
again
in
june
of
'02.
that
provision--
ms.
amy
k.
posner
--there
was
no
proposal,
your
honor.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
plan...
it's
at
170a
of
the
joint
appendix...
which
allows
for
rehabilitative
employment
for
disabled
people
who
may
have
the
physical
capacity
to
do
work
they
were
not
doing
before.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
k.
posner
thank
you
your
honor.
on
question
one,
i
think
it's
important
to
know
that
the
zone
of
reasonableness
and
the
size
of
the
field
is
set
forth
by
the
employer
when
it
designates
discretionary
authority
and
says
that
the
standard
of
review
is
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
one
in
court,
which
is
the
same
in
erisa
as
an
abuse-of-discretion
standard.
and
the...
and
the
fact
that's
common
and
known
to
the
employer
in
setting
forth
that
standard,
that
there
is
this
dual
role,
shouldn't
change
that
analysis
at
all,
nor
should
it
come
into
play
in
any
significant
way
whatsoever
in
these
decisions.
but
on
question
two,
if
there
is
a
conflict
that
influence,
that's
not
what
the
employer
was
anticipating.
and
so
it...
it
changes
the
size
of
the
permissible
field.
and
to
get
to
justice
scalia's
point,
the
actual
conflict
there
does
matter
because
it
changes
the
size
of
the
field.
it's
not
what
the
employer
was
intending
in
its
plan.
now,
if...
also
on
question
two,
if
you
