chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-923,
metropolitan
life
insurance
versus
glenn.
miss
posner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
that
work?
i
don't
understand.
you
go
through,
you've
got
a
decision,
whatever,
it's
a
health
insurance
decision
that
this
procedure...
to
determine
that
this
procedure
is
not
covered
under
the,
the
plan,
that
the
fiduciary
has
the
discretion
to
make
that
determination.
but
you
say,
aha,
he's
got
a
conflict
of
interest,
so
that's
a
factor
we
take
into
account.
well,
how
does...
what
does
that
mean?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right,
you've
got
two
cases,
one
where
the
person
does
not
have
a
conflict
of
interest
under
a
particular
plan,
the
other
where
he
does.
it's
the
same
decision:
we're
not
going
to
cover
this
procedure.
how
is
the
review
different
in
each
of
those
cases
as
a
practical
matter?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i
don't
see
an
answer
to
my
question
yet.
how
does
the
review
differ
as
a
functional
matter?
he
says
he
looks
at
it
and
says,
well,
normally
that
would
be
within
the
discretion,
but
i've
got
to
remember
he's
got
a
conflict,
so
i'm
going
to
determine
that
this
particular
procedure
should
be
covered
because
of
the
conflict.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
justice
souter's
question
and
justice
alito's
question
highlight
for
me
what
i
think
is
the
central
issue.
justice
souter
had
asked
you
whether
the
conflict
comes
into
play,
you
know,
when
it's
a
tie.
and
you're
right
on
the
fence,
and
you
say,
well,
the
conflict's
a
factor,
so
it
tips
over
in
the
employee's
favor.
justice
alito's
question
asked
you
whether
or
not
the
conflict
has
to
play
a
role
in
the
decision.
i
don't
know
how
that
would
be,
but
let's
say,
for
example,
the
insurance
company
is
doing
well
and
so
they
say,
well,
we
allow
coverage
for
this
procedure.
all
of
a
sudden,
the
insurance
company
looks
like
it's
not
doing
so
well,
it's
not
going
to
meet
the
quarterly
targets
or
whatever,
so
it
says,
well,
we're
no
longer
going
to
allow
coverage
for
that
procedure.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
conflict
itself
that
affects
which
way
it
comes
out.
now,
which
is
right:
justice
souter's
case
in
which
the
conflict
tips
the
scales,
no
matter
what
the
reason
is;
or
justice
alito's
case
where
the
conflict
plays
a
role
in
the
decision
process?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
rosenkranz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
trust
law
doesn't
take
into
account
what
we
have
said
repeatedly
in
our
erisa
decisions,
which
is
we
want
to
encourage
people
to
set
up
erisa
plans.
and
that
has
affected
the
standards
that
we've
adopted,
for
example,
that
we
even
allow
a
conflict
of
interest
like
this
to
exist.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
is
going
to
hurt
beneficiaries
under
erisa
plans
because
people
are
going
to
say,
as
they're
perfectly
free
to
do...
people,
the
employers,
are
going
to
say,
as
they
are
perfectly
free
to
do,
you
know,
i'm
just
not
going
to
do
it;
if
we're
going
to
have
judges
looking
at
these
claims
decisions
on
a
de
novo
basis,
who
knows
how
much
it'll
end
up
costing
me,
so
i'm
not
going
to
set
up
these
plans.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you...
which
position
do
you
adopt?
it
was
only
posed
as
hypothetical,
so
i
don't
mean
to
attribute
the
position
to
you;
but
the
justice
souter
hypothetical
or
the
justice
alito
hypothetical?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
sounds
like
the
justice
alito
hypothetical.
in
other
words,
the
extra
scrutiny
has
to
be
consonant
with
the
purpose.
the
purpose
is
to
protect
against
the
conflict.
so
if
the
scrutiny
doesn't
reveal
that
the
conflict
played
a
role,
then
it's...
then
it's
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we've
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
judicial
eyes
today,
but
it
doesn't...
it
makes
it
sound
as
if
abuse-of-discretion
review
is
nothing,
and
with
the
added
factor
you
want
to
look
more
closely.
courts
undertaking
abuse-of-discretion
review
don't
do
it
blindly.
they
look
at
it.
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
they
give
deference
on
the
judgment
calls.
and
i'm
still
not...
i
still
don't
understand
how
the
added
factor
or,
in
your
case,
the
added
seven
factors
affects
that
issue
of
deference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
under
trust
law--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
don't
have...
we
don't
have
an
established
policy
of
encouraging
people
to
establish
trusts.
we
do
have
reflected
in
our
decisions
an
established
policy
of
encouraging
people
to
set
up
erisa
plans.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief

john
g.

miss
posner,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
