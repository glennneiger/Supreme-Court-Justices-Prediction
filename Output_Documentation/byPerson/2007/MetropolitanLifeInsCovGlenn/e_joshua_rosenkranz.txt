mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
got
it
right
in
firestone
when
it
said,
of
course
a
conflict
must
be
weighed.
there's
no
reason
for
this
court
to
override
its
well-reasoned
and
unanimous
conclusion
which--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--it
was
dictum,
your
honor,
but
it
was
very
well-considered
dictum
because...--
[laughter]
--the
only
issue
before
the
court
so
far
as
the
parties
thought
was
what
is
the
effect
of
this
dual
role
that
firestone
had?
and
this
court
did
not
answer
that
question,
but
that's
what
the
parties
were
arguing
about.
so
this
court
correctly
discerned
the
rule
from
trust
law.
it
correctly
discerned
and
balanced
erisa's
policies
and,
if
anything--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the
answer--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--absolutely,
your
honor.
the
answer
is
yes
in
many
circumstances.
and
the
beauty
of
the
court's
invocation
of
trust
law
is
that
trust
law
answers
the
question.
trust
law
says
that
when
you
have
a
fiduciary
with
a
conflict,
you
apply
especially
careful
scrutiny.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
i
understand,
and
this
court
considered
that
in
firestone,
the
litigation
cost
and
the
added
administrative
costs,
and
this
court
concluded
en
route
to
de
novo
review
that
the
1132(a)(1)(b)
remedy
is
so
infused
with
the
interests
of
ensuring
that
the
beneficiaries
get
their
benefits
due,
that
that
is
the
interest
that
the
courts
weigh
most
in
determining
the
standard
of
review.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
the
answer
is
both.
they
can
happen
under
both
circumstances...
circumstances.
but
let
me
explain
why.
what
trust
law
does
is
to
say
we
apply
especially
careful
scrutiny.
and
the
scrutiny
has
to
be
consonant
with
the
purpose
of
the
scrutiny,
which
is
to
ensure
that
the
conflicted
fiduciary
does
not
end
up
subconsciously
or
consciously
tilting
the
scale.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor,
because
what
trust
law
says
is
that
you
apply
especially
careful
scrutiny,
which
entails
two
things.
the
first
thing
is
what
this
court
called
keeping
the
judicial
eye
peeled
for
conflict
of
interest
in
rush.
so
that's
an
examination
of
the
record
of
the
decisionmaking
process.
you
kick
the
tires,
you
test
the
judgments,
as
the
sixth
circuit
did
in
this
case,
and
you
ask
yourself,
is
this
the
work
of
an
unbiased
fiduciary?
the
second
thing
is
to
imagine
a
zone
of
reasonableness
within
which
a
reasonably
prudent
trustee
might
land
and
then
say
to
yourself
at
the
outer
limits
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
we
will
accept
the
judgment
of
an
unconflicted
fiduciary
because
there
is
no
reason
for
us
to
suspect
that
he
reached
that
result
because
of
the
bias.
for
a
conflicted
fiduciary
you
can
contract
that
zone
of
reasonableness.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
it
absolutely
does,
and
the
26
law
professors
in
the
amicus
brief
that
they
filed
with
this
court
explain
exactly--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--absolutely--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--so
let
me
break
it
down
and
first
turn
to
the
premise.
it
is
simply
not
correct
that
every
employer
is
conflicted.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
okay.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
okay.
but
the
bank
example,
your
honor,
that
is
not
a
pressure,
which
is
kind
of
a
business
pressure,
that
trust
law
recognizes
as
a
conflict
of
interest.
trust
law
acknowledges
that
trustees
are
often,
almost
always,
in
the
business
of
administering
trusts,
and
they
don't...
they
make
their
money
by
doing
the
job
well.
the
big
difference
is
we
are
talking
here
about
a
direct
impact
on
the
bottom
line.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--justice
breyer,
it's
just
wrong
under
trust
law
and
it's
wrong
under
the
facts,
as
everyone
knows
them
to
be
in
the
insurance
industry.
the
insurance
industry
makes
its
money
on
the
differential
between
the
premiums
that
it
charges
and
the
payouts
in
claims.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
but...
so
let
me
give
an
example
from
real
life.
metlife,
for
example,
shells
out
$14
billion
a
year
in
erisa
covered
claims.
if
it
denies
one
out
of
a
hundred
claims
improperly,
we
are
talking
about
$140
million.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor,
the
first
thing
to
say
is
that...
if
that
is,
in
fact,
an
authorized
transaction,
that
would
fall
under
the
self-dealing
rules
of
trust
law,
and
trust
law
self-dealing
rules
are
situations
in
which
the
set
law
has
actually
suspended
the
duty
of
loyalty
of
the
trustee...
that's
correct...
of
the
trustee.
that
is
absolutely
impermissible
under
erisa.
you
cannot
suspend
the
duty
of
loyalty
under
erisa.
there
is
a
clear
provision
about
that.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
says
that
explicitly
in
the
claim
file?
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
the
decisionmaker
here
is
the
court
reviewing?
or--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--to
consider
it,
yes,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
in
case
number
two,
if
you
are
right
at
the
edge
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness
and
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record
to
raise
suspicions
about
the
process
by
which
the
decisionmaker
got
there--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor,
except
for
that
what
would
appear
to
be
at
a...
right
at
the
outer
bounds
of
reasonableness
for
an
unconflicted
fiduciary
could
knock
you
over
the
fence,
to
use
your
honor's
earlier
analogy,
for
a
conflicted
fiduciary.
definitely
not
for
scenario
two.
if
the
decisionmaker
is
correct
in
the
judgment
of
the
court,
"gee,
i
don't
know
where
to
go,
this
is
really
close.
"
well,
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
in
fact,
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
you're
right
at
the...
the
target
center
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
then
no,
a
court
would
absolutely
not
hold--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--number
three.
in
number
three,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--but
the
decisionmaker,
you
said,
your
honor,
in
number
three,
could
not
make
up
its
mind.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
and
if
the...
and
if
the
court
confirms
yes;
the
decisionmaker
was
right
that
this
was
really
close;
you're
right
at
the
target
center
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness
and
the
conflict
of
interest
doesn't
push
you
over.
the
only
thing
that
the
conflict
of
interest
could
do
there
is
the
judicial
eye
becomes
peeled
for
other
evidence
of
conflict
which
would
end
up--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
let
me
rephrase
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
two
things.
the
first
is
especially
careful
scrutiny,
just
in
the
abstract,
stepping
back
from
the
hypothetical,
means
that
you
focus
really
carefully
on
the
process
by
which
the
decision
was
made,
as
the
sixth
circuit
did
in
this
case.
"this
is
strange,
they
are
completely
ignoring
this
evidence.
"
"they
are
cherry
picking.
"
"they
are
doing
about-faces.
"
that's
one.
secondly,
if
you
are
at
the
target
center
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
and
none
of
those
procedural
irregularities
have
arisen,
to
be
sure
that
the
district
court
reviewing
would
affirm
that
judgment--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
where
the
court
can't
calibrate.
what
the
court
can
do
is
provide
very
clear
guidance
to
the
lower
courts.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
i--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i
would
say
first
and
foremost...
i
would
say
three
things
to
the
district
courts.
number
one,
this
is
not
just
some
form
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
agency
review
with
just
a
little
bit
more
bite.
this
is
reasonableness
review
under
trust
law,
which
is
very,
very
different.
number
two,
the
judicial
eye
is
peeled,
as
this
court
said
in
rush,
for
conflict
of
interest.
kick
the
tires.
here
are
seven,
eight,
nine
illustrations
of
the
sorts
of
things
that
lower
courts
should
be
on
the
lookout
for
as
they
are
trying
to
discern
whether
the
conflict
tainted
the
result.
number
three,
if...
if
you
are
at
the
outer
bounds
of
reasonableness
for
an
unconflicted
trustee,
you
can
contract
that
zone
of
reasonableness
because
you
don't...
when...
when
an
unconflicted
trustee
is
right
at
the
outer
edge,
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
his
motive.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor.
it
would
be
a
factor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
first,
just
to
be
clear,
we
are
talking
about
still
a
deferential
standard.
it's
just
not
as
deferential
as
it
would
otherwise
be.
absolutely.
an
insurer
can
come
in
and
say,
look,
we've
created
all
these
procedures;
they
have
mitigated
the
conflict,
but
it
can
never
get--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor,
unless
the
insurance
company
comes
in
and
can
demonstrate
in
a
case
that
we've
never
heard
of--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
one
very
important
thing
to
say
about
that
is
that
under
trust
law,
an
authorized
conflict.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
i
don't
understand
the
hypothetical,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--only
where
what
the
bank
is
doing
is
engaging
in
self-dealing
that...
of
the
sort
that's
authorized.
thank
you,
your
honor.
