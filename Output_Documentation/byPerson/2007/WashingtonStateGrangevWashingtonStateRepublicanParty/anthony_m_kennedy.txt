justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
you...
you
didn't
quite
answer
that
question.
you
said,
oh
no,
and
you
gave
an
explanation.
but
just
as
a
matter
of
the
historical
record--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--justice
alito's
question
was
accurate
with
respect
to
the
proponent's
position,
was
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
your
position
that
the
parties
are
not
really
injured
or
affected
by
this,
and
the
parties'
position
is
that
they
are,
who
should
we
believe?
i
mean,
it's
hard
for
you
to
tell
the
parties
that
they
don't
know
what's
in
their
best
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
is
evidence
that,
in
other
states,
those
who
preached
racial
hatred
have
tried
to
associate
themselves
with
a
particular
party,
much
to
the
concern
of
that
party,
and
i
see
nothing
in
your
position
that
would
prevent
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
the
remedy
for
the
party,
you
said,
to
have
more
speech
for
the
party,
to
say
that
this
is
not
their
candidate,
etcetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
court
has
said
that
parties
could
be
strictly
limited
in
the
amount
of
moneys
they
spend
to
endorse
a
particular
candidate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
think
the
law
can
have
it
both
ways.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
the
counsel
for
the
respondents,
and
you
can
answer
as
well,
can
you
explain
to
me
briefly
the
existing
structure
for
the
republican
party,
the
democratic
party,
to
say
mr.
smith
is
our
nominee?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
it's
not
just
a
rhetorical
flourish.
it's
true;
when
the
state
says
that
you
take
the
position
that
you
are
entitled
to
say
on
the
ballot
who
your
nominee
is,
that
has
to
be
a
correct
statement
of
your
position
given
this
statute
and
given
the
issues
presented
to
us
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
that
just
somewhat
hyperbolic?
it
seems
to
me
he
is
right
based
on
your...
on
the
position
you're
now
stating.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
were
an
empirical
study
that
washington
voters
know
about
this
system,
and
that
80
percent
of
the
washington
voters
know
that
the
party
has
not
endorsed
any
one
of
these...
all
of
these
candidates.
that
it's
just
say
a
statement
of
preference,
that
that's
all
it
means;
the
voters
know
this.
is
your
position
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
my
submission,
or
my
hypothetical
and
it's
just
a
hypothetical,
is
that
no
one
is
misled
by
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
accept
the
hypothetical
as
true.
then
what's
the
injury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
be
the
validity
or
the
invalidity,
in
your
view,
of
a
scheme
which
said
that
the
ballot
has
one
candidate
who
says,
smith,
republican
nominee,
and
the
other
candidates...
other
candidates
say,
republican
preference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
can't
answer
my
question?
you
can't
hypothesize
any
legitimate
state
interest
for
doing
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
when
the
court
writes
this
opinion,
what's
the
fairest
statement
of
the
state's
interest
in
this
requirement?
what
do
you
think
is
the
fairest
statement
of
the
state's
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
there's
no
legitimate
interest?
it's...
it's
an
unfair
question,
i
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
going
to
ask
the
state
the
same
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
state
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
weakening
the
influence
of
political
parties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
found
that
that
was
the
necessary
effect
of
this
ballot
measure,
then
would
it
be
invalid?
