you
have
two
choices
and
i
think
there's
another
one
on
page
12,
is
there
not?
so
are
you
representing,
general
mckenna,
that
one
of
these
will
be
what
the
state
of
washington
ballot
will
look
like?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
mckenna,
may
i
ask
you
at
that
point--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
that's
a
correct
statement
of
your
position.
i
didn't
understand
you
to
take
the
position
that
a
candidate
has
a
constitutional
right
to
state
on
the
ballot.
the
state
of
washington
has
chosen
to
give
the
candidate
that
option,
but
is...
i
have
not
read
anything
in
your
brief
that
suggests
that
a
candidate
has
a
right
to
do
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
say
that
it
is
unlikely
voters
will
be
mistaken,
that
they
will
mistakenly
consider
a
statement
of
party
preference
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
party
endorsement.
you
did
say
that,
and
on
what
basis
are
you
predicting
that
the
statement
of
preference
will
not
be
confused
with
a
statement
of
endorsement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
that
right
come
from?
i
thought
in
jones,
the
court
had
said
if
you
had
just
a
blanket
primary,
with
no
indication
of
party
affiliation,
that
that
would
be
constitutional.
and
if
that's
so,
then
parties
don't
have
any
right
to
have
a
candidate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would
have
no
objection
if
this...
everything
was
the
same,
except
no
party
affiliation
were
shown.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
we
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
one
associate...
this
one...
i
think
general
mckenna
told
us
that
in
the
state
of
washington
people
do
not
register
membership
in
one
party
or
the
other,
so
how
does
the
republican
party
determine
who
is
a
republican?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
who
do
you
consider
a
member
of
the
party?
if
you
say
i
am
a
republican
in
the
state
of
washington,
what
does
that
mean?
it
doesn't
mean
i
registered
republican
because
washington
doesn't
register
people
by
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
one
of
those,
contributing
funds
is
enough?
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
convention
if
you
are--
