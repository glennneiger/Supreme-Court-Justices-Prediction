justice
david
h.
souter
general,
as
i
understand
it
the
parties
are
now
free
to
come
up
with
any
scheme
they
want
to
for
selecting
an
official
candidate.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
the
democratic
party
decides
to
have
a
state
convention.
if
the
law
in
washington
provided
that
the
nominee
selected
by
that
convention
could
state
on
the
ballot
not
merely
a
preference
for
democrats,
but
a
statement
that,
i
am
the
nominee
of
the
democratic
party,
your
position
in
this
case
i
take
it
would
be
exactly
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know
any
democrats
who
go
around
saying
i
prefer
the
democratic
party
who
do
not
regard
themselves
and
register
themselves
as
democrats?
i
mean,
in
the
real
world
i
don't
know
that...
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
fatal
to
your
case,
but
in
the
real
world,
it
seems
to
me
the
distinction
you're
drawing
is
simply
not
drawn.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
helpful
to
your
case,
but,
going
back
to
my
question,
do
you
know
any
people
who
go
around
saying,
well,
you
know,
i
really
prefer
the
democrats;
i'm
a
republican
myself?
i
mean
that,
that
doesn't
happen.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
always
one.
but
seriously,
as
a
systemic
matter,
do
you
really
think
that's...
that's
a
distinction
that
anyone
would
recognize?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
isn't
responsive
to
my
question.
do
you
really
think
that
that
distinction
is
a
distinction
which
is
accepted
as
a
working
way
of
thinking
in
this
world?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
really
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
means
that
they...
they
will
prefer
the
candidate
of
one
party
or
another,
assuming
they
vote
and
there's
no
independent
candidate
running.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
declaration,
the
very
assumption
of
status
as
an
independent
says,
i
don't
as
a
systemic
matter
prefer
one
party
to
the
other;
a
pox
on
both
their
houses.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
could.
but
do
you
really
think,
again,
in
the
real
world,
that
that's
why
people
register
themselves
as
independents?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
however
the
statement
is
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
may
not
claim
that
on
the
ballot
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you...
what
do
you
say
about
the
fact
that
you
have
a
right
to
select
and
designate
an
official
candidate
and
it's
independent
of
this
ballot
procedures?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
if
the
rationale
in
jones
was
that
the
defect
was
that
the
association,
political
association,
was
being
adulterated
by
the
method
of,
of
the
use
of
ballots,
to
select
what
was
an
official
nominee,
that
problem
does
not
exist
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
in
practical
terms,
this
is
a
nomination,
even
though
there
may
be
a
separate
official
nomination
that
nobody
pays
attention
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
is
one
party
going
to
the
trouble
of
establishing
a
convention
system
to
make
nominations?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
will
pay
no
attention,
i
take
it,
in
the
sense
that
there
will
be
nothing
indicating
an
official
nomination
on
the
ballot
itself.
but
as
i...
i
am
also
assuming
that
the
parties
through
a
convention,
or
whatever
other
scheme
they
can
come
up
with,
can...
can
designate
an
official
nominee
quite
independently
of
this
ballot.
and
if
they
do
so
designate,
they
can
campaign
on
that
person's
behalf.
the
person
in
campaigning
can
say,
i
am
the
official
nominee
of
the
x
party.
and
those
facts
are
true,
aren't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
that
a
right
to
nominate
has
to
be
a
right
to
exclude
everyone
from
the
ballot
except
the
nominee...
everyone
from
the
ballot
under
that
banner,
from
the
nominee.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
have
identified...
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
you've
identified
two
separate
problems
with
the...
with
the
scheme
as
you
see
it.
one
is,
as
you
put
it,
that
it
masks
the
identity
of
an
official
nominee,
and
the
other
is
that
it
in
effect
allows
competition
on
the
ballot
by
a
person
under
the
same
party
banner
with
the
official
nominee.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i...
no,
i
understand
that
to
be
your
position,
but
my
question
is,
and
i
realize
there
is
a
certain
awkwardness
to
this,
but
we...
we've
got
to
face
it:
if
the
masking
of
the
identity
of
the
candidate
is
the
real
flaw,
then
the...
the
hypothetical
that
was
included
in
the...
in
jones,
in
the
dictum,
of
the...
of
the
party
that...
of
the
ballot
that
has
no
party
identification
whatsoever,
that
would
equally
be
bad,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it's
the
masking
that's
the
problem,
the...
the
nominee
is
going
to
be
just
as
well
masked
on
the
ballot
or
better
masked
on
the
ballot
that
allows
no
statement
of
preference
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
fatally
your
case,
but
i
mean
it's...
it's
something
we
need
to
be
careful
about
when
we're
doing
our
thinking,
and
that's
why
i'm
pressing
you
on
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if...
but
if
it's
just
masking
in
a
partisan
system,
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
the
same
argument
that
you
make
when
you
say,
by
allowing
statements
of
preference,
we
obscure
the
character
of
the
official
nominee
and
in
effect
allow
somebody
to
have
a...
a
second
shot
at...
at
getting
republican
support
as
a
republican.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it's
masking
in
a
partisan
ballot
that's
the
real
problem,
there's
only
one
objection
and
the
objection
is
not
so
much
the
masking
as
it
is
the
submergence
of
the
official
nomination
by
allowing
competition
under
the
party's
name
by
another
candidate.
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
