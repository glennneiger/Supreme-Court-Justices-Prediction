mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
adopting
initiative
872,
washington's
voters
followed
this
court's
guidance
in
california
democratic
party
v.
jones.
they
adopted
a
top-two
election
system.
by
so
doing
the
voters
eliminated
the
crucial
constitutional
defect
of
a
partisan
blanket
primary
because
in
the
top-two
system
the
voters
are
no
longer
selecting
the
party's
nominees
for
the
november
election.
the
ninth
circuit
nonetheless
ruled
that
initiative
872
is
unconstitutional,
holding
that
allowing
each
candidate
to
state
his
or
her
personal
party
preference
on
the
ballot
would
create
the
appearance
of
association
between
a
political
party
and
candidate.
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first,
the
ninth
circuit's
appearance...
of-association
conclusion
assumes
that
top-two
ballots
will
look
the
same
as
ballots
under
a
party
nominating
election
system.
they
will
not.
the
top-two
ballot--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
we
have
not
had
an
election,
and
the
secretary
of
state
was
enjoined
by
the
district
court
before
having
the
opportunity
to
promulgate
the
regulations
governing
the
ballot
after
872's
adoption.
however,
your
honor,
we
may
look
to
the
declaration
of
candidacy
form,
which
the
secretary
of
state
did
have
the
opportunity
to
promulgate,
which
appears
in
the
corrected
joint
appendix
at
pages
592-593.
and
what
we
see
there,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that,
unlike
the
old
declaration
of
candidacy
form,
we
have
the
candidates
declaring
themselves
as
a
candidate
for
the
office
of
blank,
and
instead
of
saying
that
they're
a
candidate
of
a
party,
they
say...
that
you
have
an
opportunity
to
check
off
the
box
that
my
party
preference
is
blank
or
i'm...
i
am
an
independent
candidate;
or,
under
initiative
872,
if
they
check
neither
box,
that
will
be
left
blank
on
the
ballot.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
the
voters
could
have
chosen
to
allow
candidates
to
include
other
information.
in
fact,
in
the
state's
earliest
days
candidates
were
given
five
words
they
could
use
for
whatever
expression
they
wished.
but
the
voters
chose
to
allow
an
expression
of
party
preference,
which
the
state
is
allowed
to
do.
the
state
is
not
required
to
allow
the
ballot
to
be
a
form...
forum
for
political
expression,
but
the
state
is
allowed
to
do
so
and
has
chosen
to
do
in
this
way.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
your
honor,
because
there
is
an
immense
difference
between
the
top-two
system
and
the
system
that
replaces
the
old
blanket
nominating
primary.
the
immense
difference
is
of
course
that
the
first
stage
of
this
two-stage
general
election
process
is
no
longer
being
used
to
select
the
nominees
of
the
parties,
which
was
identified
as
the
one
characteristic
in
jones--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--well,
the
grange
was--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
grange
also
said
in
the
voters'
pamphlet
statement,
quote,
"this
system
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
partisan
blanket
primary
save
the
constitutionally
crucial
one:
primary
voters
are
not
choosing
a
primary's
nominee.
"
that's
joint
appendix
79.
so,
yes,
they
were
campaigning
for
it,
but
i
believe
that
the
relevant
state
purpose
or
regulatory
interest
in
allowing
an
expression
of
party
preference
is
the
same
as
we
see
referenced
in
tashjian
and
in
anderson
v.
celebrezze.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
all
the
major
cases
underlying
this
one
were
as-applied
challenges.
the
parties
were
able
to
bring
in,
in
all
those
cases,
evidence.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
parties
will
be
harmed
by
the
expression
of
party
preference.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
scalia,
there
may
be
an
association
in
the
dictionary
sense,
in
the
same
way
that
a
candidate
who
expressed
a
preference
for
one
public
policy
versus
another
may
be
associated.
but
in
the
constitutional
sense,
this
court
has
found
that
there
is
a
forced
association
only
when
the
objecting
party
is
compelled
to
speak
it
or
when
the
objecting
party
is--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--your
honor,
i
would
refer
the
justices
to
pages
2
and
3
of
the
grange
yellow
brief
where
two
sample
ballots
are
laid
out
that
incorporate
the
language
from
the
declaration
of
candidacy
regulations.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
this
is
what
the
ballots
will
look
like.
and...
and
until
the--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--justice
ginsburg,
these
are
two
examples
of
what
the
ballot
is
likely
to
look
like,
although
it's
frankly
also
likely
to
have
even
more
information
stating
the
difference
between
expressing
a
preference
and
expressing
a
formal
association.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
it
will
say,
your
honor,
if
you
would
look
to
the
sample--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--it
will
stay
that
it
is
not
a
statement
by
the
political
party
identifying
that
candidate.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
it
will
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
there
would
not
be,
justice
stevens,
no.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
it
would
be
equally
constitutional
if
we
prevented
someone,
yes,
sir,
from
expressing
a
party
preference
or
affiliation.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor,
because
they
will
be
promulgated
under
regulations
established
by
the
state
secretary
of
state.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
washington
state
nearly
all
voters
vote
by
mail
now.
so
they...
over
90
percent
of
voters
and
eventually
nearly
100
percent
of
voters
will
be
voting
by
mail
and
will
receive
the
same
ballot
form,
with
the
same
ballot
instructions
and
explanations
as
in
the
samples
that
i've
showed
you.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
refer
you,
justice
scalia
to
ja-415.
section
9.5(5)
of
initiative
872
requires
the
candidate
to
sign
a
notarized
declaration,
quote,
"stating
that
the
information
provided
on
the
form
is
true.
"
so
they
are
signing
declarations...
a
declaration
which
is
notarized
saying
that
everything
that
they
have
put
on
the
form
is
true.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
justice
scalia,
it
is
expression
of
preference.
it
is
a
subjective
expression.
it
would
be
difficult
to
disprove.
however,
if
a
candidate
were
to...
let's
say
the
chairman
of
the
state
republican
party
filed
a
declaration
of
candidacy
and
said,
i
prefer
the
democratic
party.
the
democratic
party
would
have
many
opportunities
to
object.
and
you
know,
the
ballot
is
not
even
the
most
important
source
of
information
that
voters
have,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
tashjian
and
celebrezze.
so
there
would
be
many
opportunities.
if
there
is
a
concern
about
false
statements,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
the
correct
approach
is
to
provide
for
more
speech,
not
to
limit
the
speech
of
all
the
candidates
by
refusing
to
permit
them
to
express
their
preferences.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
specific
instance.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
not
had
a
chance
to
even
hold
an
election.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
kennedy,
the
candidates
will
be
expressing
a
preference,
this
is
true
if
they
wish
to.
but
there
will
be
many...
first
of
all,
that
is
not
compelled
speech
by
the
party;
and
secondly,
it
is
not
compelling
the
party
to
accept
that
person
as
a
member,
as
a
member.
as
the
emergency
rules
for
the
declaration
and
as
a
sample
ballot
show,
we'll
be
very
explicit
in
explaining
to
the
voters
that
someone
claiming
a
preference,
it's
not
a
statement
by
the
party
that
they're
claiming
the
person
as
a
member
or
a
formal
association.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
what--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--but
there
will
be
many
opportunities--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--your
honor,
if
i
can
use
an
example
that
might
help
illustrate
our
point.
imagine
that
mr.
dale
from
the
boy
scouts
v.
dale
case
moved
to
washington
state
and
wanted
to
run
for
office,
and
imagine
that,
instead
of
saying
party
preference,
the
voters
had
said,
well,
you
can
choose
to
list
any
organization
for
which
you
have
a
preference,
a
political
organization
or
another;
and
that
mr.
dale
decided
to
express
a
preference
for
the
boy
scouts.
mr.
dale
would
be
exercising
his
own
speech,
but
that
would
not
be
the
same
thing
as
compelling
speech
by
the
boy
scouts.
nor
would
he
be
compelling--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--allowing...
mr.
chief
justice,
allowing
mr.
dale
to
say
he
has
a
preference
for
the
boy
scouts
i
don't
think
can
reasonably
be
confused
with
him
claiming
that
he
is
a
member,
particularly
when
as
applied--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be
harder
to
argue
from
our
side.
but
your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit
only
assumed
that
the
ballot
would
look
like
the
ballot
on
page
1
of
the
grange
yellow
brief.
they
assumed
that
the
ballot
would
look
exactly
like
the
ballot
in
a
nominating
primary,
and
our
point
here
is
that
it
will
not.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
state
law
would
not
permit
that.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
alito,
the
state
could
have
chosen
to
allow
people
to
change
their
preference
expression.
but
the
state
did
not
and
the
state
is
not
required
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
there
is
also...
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
also
an
important
practical
consideration
here.
and
the
court
has
recognized
the
state
has
regulatory
practical
interests--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--yes.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
you're
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
candidates
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
any
information
on
the
ballot
like
an
expression
of
party
preference.
and
i
was
about
to
say,
there
is
a
very
important
practical
reason
to
require
candidates
to
decide
what
their
preference
will
be
listed
as
and
to
keep
it
the
same.
the
reason
is
that
we
have
to
have
time
to
print
the
ballots
and
produce
the
ballots
in
time
to
send
out
3
weeks
before
the
election,
when
over
90
percent
of
voters
begin
voting
by
mail.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
on
two
bases,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
basis
is
that,
as
we've
shown
with
the
sample
ballots
from
the
grange
brief,
the
state
will
be
extremely
explicit
in
stating
that
the
candidate's
claim
of
preference
or
statement
of
preference
is
not
the
party's
statement
that
the
candidate
is
a
member,
endorsee,
nominee,
or
what
have
you.
the
second
basis
is
i
think
just
the
general
basis
this
court
has
recognized
in
tasjian
and
in
anderson
v.
cellebreze,
where
the
court
expressed
a
greater
faith
in
the
ability
of
individual
voters
to
inform
themselves
beyond
just
the
balance.
there
are
so
many
other
sources
of
information.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
justice
scalia,
i
respectfully
disagree.
this
is
not
an
association
in
the
constitutional
sense.
it
is
merely
an
expression
of
preference,
which
we...
which
initiative
872
in
its
open
language
and
which
the
ballot
will
carefully
distinguish
from
claiming
a
formal
association.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
i
think
it's
helpful
to
think
of
the
expression
of
party
preference
as
a
subset
of
party
affiliation.
in
other
words,
someone
might
be
a
party
affiliate--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--well,
the
example
of
senator
lieberman
comes
to
mind,
where
he
said
i
really
prefer
the
democrats
and
i'm
running
as
an
independent.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
i
think
that
we
are
permitted
to
allow
people
to
express
their
preference.
many
of
these
people
who
do
so
would
be
independents,
i
think.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes.
yes,
i
do,
justice
souter.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
in
washington
state
over
40
percent
of
the
voters,
for
example,
identify
themselves
by...
as
independents.
keeping
in
mind
we
have
no
party
registration
in
washington
state,
over
40
percent
of
voters
when
asked
say
i'm
an
independent;
i
may...
and
that
does
not
mean
they
may
not
prefer
one
party
over
the
other,
they
may
not
generally
vote
for
one
party
or
the
other,
but
they
think
of
themselves
as
independent.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
souter,
it
may
also
mean
that
i
choose
not
to
formally
affiliate
with
the
party,
even
though
i
prefer
that
party's
policies,
goals.
you
look
at
the
independent--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--we
have
no
registration
in
washington
state,
justice
souter.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
where
individuals
have
run...
have
run
for
office
as
independents
and
then
have
chosen
to,
you
know,
attend
the
caucus
meetings
of
the
democratic
party,
for
example.
so,
yes,
it
does
happen.
and
the
point
is
that
people
are
allowed
to
do
this,
but
they're
not
required
to.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
your
honor,
as
legal
counsel
for
the
state
we've
analyzed
that
question,
and
have
concluded
that
unless
and
until
the
legislature
chooses
to
alter
the
statute
to
harmonize
at
a
practical
level,
the
way
that
we
will
apply
that
statute
is
to
count
the
votes
of
the
party
cast
for
the
party's
official
nominee.
the
person
who
has
been
identified
the
party
through
their
separate
nominating
process,
for
example,
through
a
convention,
that
person
will
be
identified.
and
they
will
campaign
as
"the
nominee".
they
will
explain
that
to
the
voters
in
every
way
possible,
and
we
will
count
the
votes
cast
for
that
person
in
calculating
whether
the
5
percent
threshold
has
been
met.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
well,
the
initiative
872,
justice
kennedy,
repealed
the
old
state
law
which
required
the
parties
to
use
the
state
primary
to
select
their
nominees.
and
initiative
872,
in
fact,
is
silent
on
the
procedures
the
parties
will
follow.
so
they
are
left
as
they
were
back
in
the
early
days
of
statehood
to
decide
for
themselves
how
to
designate
their
nominees.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no.
actually,
your
honor,
they
have.
in
fact,
the
republican
party
after
initiative
872
was
adopted
and
before
it
was
enjoined
adopted
rules
and
procedures
for
holding
nominating
conventions.
and
they
also,
for
example,
adopted
a
rule,
which
is
rule
5,
that
they
said
that
if
an
incumbent
runs
and
receives
66
percent
of
the
support
at
the
nominating
convention,
no
other
republican
can
go
onto
the
ballot.
this
is
their
claim.
no
other
republican
can
go
onto
the
first
stage
ballot
and
claim
to
be
a
republican.
that
is
their
assertion.
only
that
one
person
can
go
on
with
the
"r"
after
his
name...
an
idea
that
we
basically
reject
if
it
means
that
no
one
else
can
even
express
a
preference
for
the
republican
party.
but
we
agree
that
only
one
candidate
will
be
allowed
to
truthfully
claim
that
he
or
she
is
the
nominee
of
the
party
if
the
party
has
gone
through
a
nominating
process
of
its
own.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
are
not.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
justice
scalia,
they
did
not
check
with
the
state
officials.
they
cite
in
the
record
letters
from
a
couple
of
county
auditors.
but
the
county
auditors
have
no
independent
authority.
they
operate
under
the
secretary
of
state's
rules.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
yes,
sir,
justice
scalia,
they
may.
i
would
just
like
to
close
this
part
of
my
argument,
if
i
may,
by
pointing
out
that
in
our
view
the
voters
have
adopted
a
top-two
election
system
which
vindicates
both
the
rights
of
the
parties
and
the
people.
the
parties
can
select
their
standardbearers
without
any
state
interference,
adopting
their
own
nomination
process.
and
the
people
are
not
limited
to
candidates
selected
by
the
parties.
they
have
more
choice,
which
is
a
value
that
was
validated
in
the
jones
decision,
albeit
holding
that
you
can't
do
that
with
nonmembers
selecting
the
party's
nominees.
the
parties,
though,
argue
that
no
candidate
can
even
state
an
expression
of
party
preference,
cannot
make
an
expression
of
party
preference
on
the
ballot
without
the
party's
consent.
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion,
the
parties
are
really
claiming
they
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
require
the
state
to
place
a
single
candidate
of
their
choosing
on
the
ballot.
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
13--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--mr.
chief
justice,
they
make
that
claim
without
the
benefit
of
any
evidence.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court
and
the
parties
simply
assume
this
will
happen,
and
they
assume,
for
example,
that
ballot
looks
just
like
the
old
nominating
primary
ballot,
when,
in
fact,
as
we've
shown,
it
clearly
will
not.
and,
of
course,
we
don't
believe
trademark
law
applies
here
in
this
case,
although
i
can
address
that
if
you
wish.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
they
deserve
protection,
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
merely
allowing
someone
to
express
their
party
preference
somehow
will
mislead
the
voters.
this
court
has
shown
more
faith
in
the
voters
than
that.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
justice
kennedy,
the
state's
interest
is
what
we
have
said
it
is
all
along.
it
is
to
convey
some
information
on
the
ballot
in
the
same
way
that
the
party
label
does.
i
have
noticed
that
the
political
parties
have
never
objected
to
having
their
nominees
listed
on
the
ballot
as...
you
know,
as
such.
in
this
case
it's
an
expression
of
party
preference,
to
be
sure,
and
nothing
more
than
that;
and
there
is
useful
information
which
is
conveyed.
we
are
not
required
to
allow
it,
but
the
voters
have
chosen
to
allow
it.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
your
honor.
i
did
not
say
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
said
that
that
would
be
a
different
argument.
it
might
be
a
more
difficult
argument.
the
ninth
circuit
assumed
that
that
is
what
the
ballot
would
look
like,
even
though
there
was
not
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit
reaching
that
conclusion.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
well,
i
would
defend
it,
your
honor,
by
saying
that
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
let's
apply
it.
and
if
there
is
evidence--
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
--it
would...
it
could
be
unconstitutional,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
were
evidence
that
the
voters
were
misled
or
confused.
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
an
excellent
opportunity
to
point
out
that
the
letter
after
the
name,
whether
it's
the
letter
as
on
page
one
of
the
grange
ballot
or
an
expression
of
party
preference
on
pages
two
and
three,
is
not
the
only
information
on
the
ballot.
as
we've
shown
in
the
samples,
there
will
be
lots
of
other
information
on
the
ballot
which
clearly
distinguishes
the
expression
of
party
preference.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
in
the
scenario
or
the
ballot
on
page
1,
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
what
would
happen
is
the
secretary
of
state
would
still
provide
the
additional
language.
if
that
additional
language
is
not
provided,
if
it
were
just
that
bare
ballot
with
no
explanatory
language,
then,
yes,
it
would
be
much
harder
to
defend
as
being
constitutional.
but
that,
in
fact,
is
not
the
way
it's
going
to
work.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
but
the
key
here,
your
honor,
is
that
even
under
the
ballot
on
page
one,
what
is
not
happening
under
top-two
is
that
the
nominee
of
the
party
is
not
being
selected.
that's
not
happening
any
more.
and
in
jones
the
court
said
that
the
top-two
is
the
same
in
all
characteristics
save
one,
which
is
the
result
of
the
nominee
not
being
selected.
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
happening
under
top-two:
the
nominee
is
not
being
selected;
and,
as
applied,
we
are
going
to
be
providing
lots
of
other
information
on
the
ballot
to
make
it
very
clear
what
the
expression
"party
preference"
means.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
i
think
your
honor
you
would
have
to
find
there
is
a
severe
burden
on
the
parties
and
subject
the
provision
to
party
presence
to
strict
scrutiny.
and
if
you
did
that,
and
it
were
unconstitutional,
as
it
probably
would
be
in
that
instance,
it
would
be
severable,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
mckenna
it
has
legitimate
interest
indicating
something
about
party
on
the
ballot.
this,
the
same
legitimate
interest
that
occurs
in
a
nominating
primary
where
the,
where
the
party,
where
all
the
candidates
who
have
filed
under
that
office
are
going
to
miss
the
party
in
terms
of
conveying
our...
on
the
question
of
receiveribility
i
think
washington
law
applies
here
the
mcgowan
three-part
test
which
is
paralleled
under
federal
severability
and
booker
simply
states
that
an
act
or
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
no
its
entirety
unless
it's
believed
the
voters
would
not
have
passed
one
without
the
other
or
unless
the
validation
party
to
accomplish
the
legislative
purposes
clearly
understands
in
this
case
the
main
purpose
was
to
preserve
choice.
it
was
called
the
people's
choice
initiative.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
