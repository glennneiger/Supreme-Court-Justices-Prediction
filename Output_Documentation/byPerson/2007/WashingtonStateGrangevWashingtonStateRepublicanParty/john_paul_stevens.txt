justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
alito
can
defend
his
own
question,
but
he
asked
whether
or
not
the
grange
stated
that
this
was
the
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
state
law
that
would
prevent
you
from
requiring
a
candidate
to
be
a
member
of
the
party
whose
preference
he
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
under
the...
under
the
court's,
holding
it
would
be
equally
unconstitutional
if
he
did
that,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
indeed,
there's...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence,
any
historical
evidence,
that
any
candidate
has
ever
done
what
justice
scalia
suggests?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
it's
hypothetical,
i
suppose,
but
supposing
the
statute
further
provided
that
a
candidate
may
not
designate
a
preference
unless
he
has
been
a
registered
member
of
that
party
for
at
least
a
year,
and
otherwise
the
statute
is
exactly
how
it
is
now.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
my
hypothesis
the
person
is
a
real
republican.
he
is
just
not
the
one
selected
as
the
candidate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
information
is
by
statute
true,
in
my
hypothetical
he
must
be
a
member,
but
still
you
make
the
same
objections.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
stating
to
suppress
information.
so
the
plaintiff
says
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
nominee
or
the
convention
from
publicizing
widely
the
fact
that
the
convention
picked
me
as
their
standard
bearer.
the
fact
that
some
other
member
of
the
party
gets
his
name
on
the
ballot
doesn't
prevent
the
public
from
being
informed
about
the
truth,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
prevent
him
from
running
and
saying
he
is
a
republican.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
don't
you
think
it's
relevant
information?
wouldn't
a
voter
like
to
know
whether
a
person
preferred
the
democrats
or
the
republicans?
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
if
true.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question:
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
exactly...
what
relief
did
the
district
court
grant?
did
he
enjoin
the
entire
blanket
primary
or
just
the
designation
of
parties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
was
the
narrowest
relief
he
could
have
granted
to
avoid
the
constitutional
difficulty
that
you
see?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
be
administerable
if
it
was
severed,
if
the
preference
provision
was
just
deleted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
confused
about
the
difference
between
a
facial
challenge
and
an
as-applied
challenge.
on
the
one
hand,
it's
very
helpful
to
you.
there's
no
evidence
out
there
that
this
has
ever...
this
has
ever
been
a
problem,
so
you've
got
to
attack
it
right
away,
but
then
you
have
this
relief
that
basically
enjoins
the
whole...
whole
procedure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
also
seems
highly
improbable
if
you
have
a
nominee
as
a
result
of
a
convention,
everybody
reads
the
newspapers,
they
know
who
the
republican
nominee
is,
that
there's
going
to
be
such
confusion
that
everybody
thinks
it's
one
or
two
of
the
other
people
who
also
put
an
r
after
their
name.
the
likelihood
of
massive
confusion
seems
highly
improbable
to
me.
i
mean
you...
you
have
your
own
convention
where
you
nominate
the
republican
nominee,
your
preferred
candidate,
and
that's
publicized
generally
throughout
the
state,
and
you're
concerned
that
somebody
going
into
the
ballot
box
won't...
won't
understand
what's
been
going
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
again,
the
ballot's
not
the
only
information
available
to
voters
when
they
go
into
the
polls.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
also
true
that,
by
hypothesis,
there
will
be
other
candidates
beside
the
one
r
and
the
one
d?
if
there
aren't
at
least
two
r's
and
two
d's,
there
is
no
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
point
is
there
could
never
be
a
ballot
just
like
this,
what
your
opponents
are
talking
about,
because
there
are
always
going
to
be
at
least
two
or
three
r's
and
two
or
three
d's.
and
the
sample
shows
there
is
only
one,
which
must
then
be
the
party
chosen...
i
mean
the
nominee
chosen
at
the
convention.
