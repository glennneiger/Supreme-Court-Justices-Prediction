chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-713,
washington
state
grange
v.
washington
state
republican
party
et
al.,
consolidated
with
06-730,
washington
v.
washington
state
republican
party
et
al..
general
mckenna.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
give
us
assurance
that
they
will
not?
i
take
it
we
don't...
we
haven't
had
an
election
under
this
system,
so
we
don't
know
what
the
ballots
are
going
to
look
like.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
telling
us
that
that's
what
the
ballots
are
going
to
look
like?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
just
hasn't
been
an
election
under
this,
under
this
law,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
nobody
is
voting
for
mr.
dale
perhaps
on
the
misimpression
that
he
is
affiliated
with
the
boy
scouts,
and
that's
what
undermines
the
boy
scouts'
associational
rights.
people
are
going
to
think
he's
associated
with
the
boy
scouts
even
though
they
may
want
to
disassociate
themselves
with
him.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
if
it
were
that
way,
in
other
words
if
the
ballot
looked
like
the
ballot
on
page
1
of
the
grange
reply
brief,
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
these
preference
statements
continue
under
the
general
election?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
change
between
the
primary
and
the
general
election?
can
you
say
my
preferred
party
is
the
republican
party,
so
you
get
more
republican
votes
to
get
you
over
the
hump
so
you
are
one
of
the
two,
and
then
in
the
general
election
say,
my
preference
is
the
democratic
party,
because
there
are
more
democratic
voters?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
saying...
your
argument
is
that
they
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
put
their
preference
on
the
ballot,
but
somehow
when
the
general
election
comes
along
that
first
amendment
right
evaporates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
not
allowed
to
split
the
ballot
in
their
preference,
are
they,
say
i
prefer
one
party
on
domestic
issues,
i
prefer
the
other
party's
position
on
foreign
affairs?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
clearly,
it's
just
like
a
trademark
case.
i
mean,
they're
claiming
their
people
are
going
to
be
confused.
they
are
going
to
think
this
person
is
affiliated
with
the
democratic
or
republican
party
when
they
may,
in
fact,
not
be
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
didn't
suggest
it
would
be
a
trademark
violation.
i
think
i
said
it
was
just
like
the
same
analysis.
and
i
don't
know
why
you
would
give
greater
protection
to
the
makers
of
products
than
you
give
to
people
in
the
political
process.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
white.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
have,
for
example,
a
disclaimer,
it
seems
to
me
that
undermines
your
argument
that
they
are
successfully,
anyway,
purporting
to
carry
the
party's
message.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
libertarians
have
a
lot
more
rules
than
the
other
parties.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
white.
general
mckenna,
you
have
4
minutes
relating.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
you
did
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
could
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
mean
how
would
you
defend
that?
i
mean--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we
are
assuming
it
is
applied
in
the
way
that
is
shown
on
the
grange
reply
brief
at
page
1.
if
it
were
applied
in
that
way,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
it
just
says
r
or
d.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
state
has
no
legitimate
interest
it's
going
to
fail
any
level
of
scrutiny.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
