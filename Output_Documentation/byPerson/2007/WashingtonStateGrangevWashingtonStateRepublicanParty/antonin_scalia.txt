we
know
what...
what
it's
going
to
be
like.
we
don't
know
the
exact
phrasing
on
the
ballot,
but
we
do
know
that
a
candidate
is
allowed
to
associate
himself
with
a
party,
but
a
party
is
not
allowed
to
disociate
itself
from
the
candidate.
i
am
less
concerned
about
the
fact
that
the
candidate
can't
say
i'm
the...
i'm
the
no-taxes
candidate,
than
i
am
about
the
fact
that
he
can
associate
himself
with
the
republican
party
or
the
democratic
party
on
the
ballot
and
that
party
has
no
opportunity
on
the
ballot
to
say,
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
person.
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a
great
disadvantage
to
the
parties.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
a
first
amendment
forced
association.
i'm
talking
about
an
association
for
purposes
of
making
this
a
fair
election
at
which
the
parties
have
an
opportunity
to
nominate
and
support
their
own
candidates.
and
what
this
system
creates
is
a
ballot
in
which
an
individual
can
associate
himself
with
the
republican
party,
but
on
the
ballot
the
republican
party
is
unable
to
dissociate
itself
from
that
candidate.
justice
antonin
scalia
will,
will
it
say
whether
the
party
that
is
preferred
likes
this
candidate?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
can
say
yes
or
no
to
that.
will
it
say
whether
the
party
for
which
he
expresses
a
preference
claims
or
disclaims
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
please
answer
yes
or
no.
will
it
say
whether
the
party
for
which
he
has
expressed
a
preference
claims
or
disavows
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
iis
there
any,
what
should
i
say,
truth
investigation
by
the
state
of
washington?
suppose
a
candidate
who
has
been
a
democrat
all
his
life,
has
run
for
office
as
a
democrat,
agrees
with
all
the
positions
of
the
democratic
party,
chooses
to
state
on
the
ballot:
i
prefer
the
republican
party.
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess...
how
can
you
say
it's
false?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
thinks
he
prefers
it,
i
guess
he
prefers
it,
even
though
it's
contrary
to
his
entire
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
enough
that...
that
there's
no
claim
of
party
endorsement.
there
is
a
claim
of
associating
himself
with
the
party,
and
if
he
associates
himself
with
the
party
it
seems
to
me
the
party
should
be
able
to
disassociate
itself
from
him.
and
i
think
it
harms
the
party
not
to
permit
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
mckenna,
i'm
interested
in
how
this
new
system
meshes
with
the
otherwise
quite
partisan
nature
of
washington's
election
laws.
for
example,
the
major
political
parties
have
a
certain...
certain
benefits
that
are
not
given
to
minor
parties,
and
the
major
parties
are
determined
on
the
basis
of
obtaining
more
than
a
certain
percentage,
i
think
it's
5
percent,
in
a
statewide
election.
how
are
you
going
to
figure
out
whether
the
republican
party
has,
has
gotten
more
than
5
percent
when
all
you
have
is
somebody
who
expresses
a
preference
for
the
republican
party,
although
he's
not
really
a
republican?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
have
not
devised
a
structure
that
we
know
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
of
the
briefs
says
that
the
republicans...
i
think
the
republicans
or
the
democrats
checked
with
the,
with
the
state
election
officials
who
said
that
there's
no
provision
for
convention,
for
nomination
by
convention.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
can...
they
can
conduct
conventions
if
they
wish?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
you
to
say
that
you
have
a
right
to
a
partisan
process
in
which
your...
only
your
nominee
is
shown.
i
thought
you're
saying
that
if
it
is
a
process
in
which
party
affiliation
is
shown,
then
your
endorsed
candidate
should
be
set
aside
somehow.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
candidates'
party
preferences.
they
can
make
that
known
to
the
voters
in
the
newspapers
when
they
run.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
the
republican
party
endorsement,
but
i
prefer
the
republican
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
the
state's
interest
was
to...
to
do
what
we
disapproved
in
jones
without
seeming
to
do
what
we
disapproved
in
jones.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
did,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
have
said
that.
