mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
candidates
are
the
party's
messengers
to
win
over
the
public
on
the
important
issues
of
the
day.
initiative
872
converts
the
established
right
of
political
parties
to
select
their
messengers
into
a
mere
right
to
endorse.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
as
the
secretary
of
state
pointed
out...
and
this
is
at
ja-363...
the
secretary
of
state
indicated
the
state
would
pay
no
attention
to
the
party's
nominating
conventions
and
instead
would
continue
to
allow
candidates
to
use
party
labels
just
as
they
had
in
the
primary
before.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
it
does,
it
does,
your
honor.
and
it
does
in
the
manner
that
this...
the
candidates
who
were
selected
at
the
initiative
872,
the
modified
blanket
primary,
are
going
to
be
carrying
the
party's
standard
in
the
general
election.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
we
adopted...
the
republican
party,
the
democratic
party
and
the
libertarian
party
all
adopted
rules
governing
nomination
of
our
candidates
by
convention.
we
corresponded
with
all
of
the
county
auditors
who
would
be
conducting
partisan
elections
in
2005,
and
we
received
identical
letters
from
all
four
of
them
indicating
that
they
had
consulted
with
the
secretary
of
state
and
that
the
initiative
contemplated
no
partisan
nomination
process
separate
and
apart
from
the
primary.
the
secretary
of
state
received
copies
of
those
letters;
the
secretary
of
state's
public
statements
with
respect
to
those
letters
was
that
they
would
pay
no
attention
to
the
nominating
process.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
they
are,
your
honor,
but
that
converts
the
right
to
nominate
to
a
mere
right
to
endorse,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
ability
to
endorse
a
candidate
is
no
substitute--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--to
be...
to
be
a
meaningful
right
to
nominate,
yes,
your
honor.
it--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
parties
have
a
constitutional
right
to
place
their
party
name
on
a
truly
nonpartisan
ballot,
and
i
think
what
the
jones
court
was
hypothesizing
was
the
true
nonpartisan
primary
where
there
are
no
party
identifications.
our
objection
is
not
to
a...
necessarily
to
a
nonpartisan
ballot.
it's
to
a
partisan
ballot
where
the
state
is
going
to
put
someone
else
on
that
ballot
using
our
party's
name
and
competing
against
our
nominee
under--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--that--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--that
would
not
violate
our
first
amendment
rights,
your
honor.
washington--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
state
is
still
then
resolving
what
is
an
internal
factional
fight
between
real
republicans
using
a
blanket
ballot
where
voters
from
rival
parties
are
able
to
determine--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
then
the
blanket
is
still
selecting
which
republican
advances
to
the
general
election.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
i'm...
i'm
not--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--the
political
parties
have
the
right
to
nominate
their
candidate
and
restrict
the
use
of
the
party
name
to
candidates
who
have
been
authorized
to
use
that.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
that,
that...
that
is
our...
is
our
position,
justice
scalia.
we
are
not
suggesting
we
have
a
right
to
a
partisan
process.
washington's
constitution
makes
its
legislative
elections
a
partisan
process,
but
once
the
state
has
decided
to
use
partisan
identification
as
the
sole
information
that's
presented
on
the
ballot,
it
is
telling
the
voters
that
this
is
the
most
important
thing
for
you
to
be
considering
when
you--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
jones
with
the
comparison
of
the
mario
cuomo/edward
koch
race,
it
is
for
the
political
parties
to
be
able
to
resolve
that
internal
party
competition.
initiative
872
still
uses
blank--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question,
justice
stevens.
the
republican
party
would
not
prevent
the
unsuccessful
candidate
from
running
in
the
election.
he
could
run--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--on...
having
him
listed
on
the
ballot
where
the
state
is
indicating
that
that
is
the
most
important
information
to
consider,
the
partisan
affiliation,
and
the
state
has
hypothesized
through
the
grange
reply
brief
that
there
are
all
these
other
possible
formulations
to
ballot.
however,
before
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
state's
petition
appendix
at
page
24a,
the
ninth
circuit
squarely
put
to
the
state's
attorney
the
question:
how
would
candidates
be
designated
on
the
ballot
where
you
had
two
republicans
who
had
competed
against
each
other
in
the
party's
nominating
process,
and
one
had
been
selected;
and
a
third
candidate
who
had
absolutely
no
affiliation
with
the
party
also
entered
the
race.
and
the
state
told
the
ninth
circuit
yes,
they
would
be
identified
identically
on
the
ballot.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
notion
that
disclaimers
are
necessary,
and
the
state
indicates
that
they
will
spend
a
million
dollars
to
try
to
clear
this
up,
is
evidence
of
the
confusion
that's
likely
to
occur.
but
even
if
the
state
does
come
forward
and
put
all
these
disclaimers
and
preferences
on,
what
the
state
is
essentially
doing
on
the
ballot
is
masking
who
the
republican
party's
nominee
is
by
the
presence
of
other
candidates--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--the
interest
then
is
that
you
still
have
two
republican-identified
candidates
who
are
purporting
to
carry
the
party's
message
to
the
voters,
and
the
voters
are
resolving
that
intra-party
competition.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
well,
if
you
have
the
disclaimer,
your
honor,
and
the
statements
that
this
doesn't
really
mean
anything,
then
you
would
come
to
the
question
of
what
legitimate
state
interest
is
being
advanced
by
having
someone
put
republican
on
the
ballot
as
their
party
preference,
when
it
in
fact
means
nothing;
it
does
not
mean
they
are
associated
with
the
party.
it
does
not
mean--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--at...
do
you
mean
a
legitimate
republican
candidate?
or--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--the
three
political
parties
each
have
different
definitions
and
ways
to
become...
ways
to
become
affiliated
with
the
party.
under
the
republican
party
rules
if
you
identify
yourself
to
the
republican
party
that
yes,
i
am
a
republican,
you
attend
our
caucus
and
convention
system,
you
contribute
funds
to
the
party,
you
can
be
a
member
of
the
republican
party.
the
libertarians--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
convention,
but
there
is
also
a
difference
there
between
being
a
rank-and-file
member
and
being
a
spokesman
of
the
party.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
libertarians,
though,
for
instance.
the
libertarians
require
you
to
sign
a
membership
application
and
all
members
of
the
libertarian
party
in
washington
must
sign
a
pledge
that
they
oppose
the
use
of
force
in
the
resolution
of
political
disputes.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
yes.
after
the
party
has
already
resolved
its
internal
disputes
and
determined
who
its
spokesman
will
be,
the
state
allows--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--any
candidate
to
appropriate
the
name
and
compete
against
our
nominee.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
because
what
it
is,
in
this
instance,
initiative
872
is
a
partisan
primary
that
would
mask
the
identity
of
the
party
nominee.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
no,
justice--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--well...
and
i
think
it's...
it's
the
masking
in
the
context
of
a
partisan
system.
the
state
may
elect
to
have
nonpartisan
offices,
and
many
local
offices
throughout
the
west
are
nonpartisan.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
i...
i
think,
justice
souter,
that
it...
that
it
is
two
separate
inquiries.
first
you
have
the
difficulty
that
as
a
practical
matter
these
candidates
will
be
identified
as
republican
nominees
or
republican
candidates,
but
even
if
the
state
were
able
to
posit
sufficient
disclaimers
and
caveats,
that
the
state
has
shown
no
valid
interest
in
allowing
a
candidate
to
use
the
name--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--well,
it's...
it's
relevant
information,
justice
stevens,
only
to
the
extent
that
it
connects
the
candidate.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
to...
to
the
extent
it
connects
the
candidate
to
the
political
party
and
its
positions
on
the
issues.
and
as
the
state
points
out
in
its
reply
brief--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
the
district
court
enjoined
the
entirety
of
initiative
872
because
it
determined
that
the
party
preference
provisions
of
initiative
872
were
not
severable
under
washington
state's
test
for
severability.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
i...
i
think
that
was
the...
i
think
that
was
the
appropriate,
and
it
is
a
narrow
relief.
the
court
looked
at
the
structure
of
the
initiative,
the
connection
of
the
party
preference,
and
the
party
preference
provisions
permeate
initiative
872,
and
determined
that
severability
was
not
appropriate.
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
because...
and
what
the
state
and
the
grange
argued
below
is
that...
they
actually
argued
for
severance
because
that
would
then
convert
initiative
872
into
a
truly
nonpartisan
primary,
but
that's
not
what
was
on
the
ballot.
if
you
take
a
look
at...
it's
ja
400.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
well,
the
court
asked
general
mckenna
a
question
during
his
argument
about
whether
the
problem
had
ever
occurred
with
a
false-flag
candidate
capturing
a
party's
name
on
the
ballot.
it
has
not
under
initiative
872
because
it
was
enjoined
before
being
effective.
but
at
page
ja
239
there's
testimony
that--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--your
honor,
it's...
the
state
has
indicated
that
our
nominee,
the
unsuccessful
nominee
and
the
false-flag
candidate
would
all
be
listed
on
the
ballot
identically.
the--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--no,
but
it's
the
only
information
presented
to
the...
the
voters
at
the
critical
moment
when
they're
casting
their
ballot,
and
as
this
court
has
noted
in...
with
respect
to
term
limits
or
provision
of
truthful
information
regarding
race
on
a
ballot,
a
state
cannot
put
its
thumbs
on
the
electoral
scales
by
favoring
one
group
of
candidates
over
another.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
that's...
that's
exactly
the
case,
justice--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--and
with
respect
to
the
importance
of
party
designations
and
party
information
on
the
ballot,
last
term
the
chief
justice,
in
wisconsin
right
to
life,
ordered
a
study
that
showed
that
85
percent
of
voters
couldn't
name
a
single
candidate
for
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
in
their
own
district,
but
the...
the
voters
know
the
political
parties.
the
political
parties
spent,
in
our
case,
a
century
and
a
half
and,
in
the
democratic
party's
case,
200
years
developing
a
message
and
developing
a
set
of
principles
with
which
the
parties
are
associated,
and--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--i
think
the
question
there,
your
honor,
is
what
is
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
in
putting
that
information
on
the
ballot?
at...
their
reply
brief
at
page
6,
the
state
says
an
independent
who
does
share
the
views
of
either
the
republican
or
democratic
party
may
prefer
the
republican
party.
that
preference
may
be
because
that
independent
is
running
in
a
district
that's
70
percent
republican.
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
in
providing
that
information
that
says,
i
prefer
the
republican
party,
where
it
connotes
no
connotation,
no--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--i...
i
cannot,
your
honor,
because
either...
if
there
is
legitimate
state
interest,
the
interest
is
in
providing
information
about
that
candidate's
positions
and
linkages
to
the
republican
party
by
saying,
my
preference
is
republican
because
i
believe
what
the
republicans
are,
whether
that
candidate
is
david
duke,
in
the
republican
case,
or
in
the
case
of
the
democrats,
a
lyndon
larouche
candidate.
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
i
think
the
fairest...
the
fairest
statement
of
the
state
interest
would
be
that
the
state
has
no
interest
in
creating
the
impression
of
false
associations
or
allowing
opportunistic
candidates
to
appropriate
the
political
party--
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
--that...
that
would
be
an
acceptable
phrasing
of
the
state's
interest
as
well,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
mr.
john
j.
white,
jr.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
initiative
872
is
unconstitutional
and
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
affirmed.
