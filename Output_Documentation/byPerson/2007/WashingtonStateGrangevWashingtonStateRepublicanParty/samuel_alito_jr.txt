justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
say
that
the
purpose
of
allowing
a
candidate
to
declare
a
preference
is
simply
to
convey
useful
information
to
voters,
but
once
you
decided,
once
the
state
decided,
that
the
ballot
was
not
going
to
indicate
party
affiliation,
why
do
you
limit
candidates
to
the
names
of
parties?
why
don't
you
allow
them
to
pick
some
other
phrase
that
better
expresses
their
point
of
view?
somebody
may
want
to
say,
i'm
the
pro-environment
candidate,
or
i'm
the
no-new-taxes
candidate.
why
do
you
limit
them
to
saying
democrat,
republican,
libertarian,
et
cetera?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
that
and
wasn't
the
purpose
that
was
offered
by
the
proponent
of
the
initiative
to
try
to
get
around
the
decision
in
jones,
to
change
the
system
as
little
as
possible?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
will
the
ballots
necessarily
be
the
same
in
every
county?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
some
of
the
counties
have
paper
ballots,
some
of
the
counties
have...
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
can't
you
do
that,
if
the
purpose
is
to
provide
accurate
information
about
a
candidate's
position.
suppose
the
candidate
prefers
one
party
at
the
time
of
the
primary
and
then
something
happens.
the
issues
change.
the
person...
the
candidate
says:
well,
now
my
preference
is
really
for
the
other
party.
i
was
close
before
and
i've
swung
over
to
the
other
side.
if
that's
accurate
information
about
where
the
candidate
stands
at
the
time
of
the
general
election,
why
can't
that
be
put
on
the
ballot,
unless
you're
trying
to
indicate
affiliation
rather
than
really
preference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
to
clarify
something
you
said
during
your
initial
argument?
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
sample
ballot
on
page
1
of
the
grange
reply
would
be
unconstitutional.
