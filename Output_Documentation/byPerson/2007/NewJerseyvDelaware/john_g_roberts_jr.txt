chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
134
on
our
original
docket,
new
jersey
v.
delaware.
mr.
farr.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
you
have
one
of
these
wharves
that
goes
beyond
the
low-water
mark
and
there
are
two
people
at
the
end
of
it
and
one
of
them
shoots
the
other,
would
they
be
prosecuted
for
murder
in
delaware
or
new
jersey?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suspect
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
would.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
split
that
difference?
i
mean
let's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
mean,
how
do
we
decide
the
difference
between
those
two
cases?
and
applicable
here,
for
example,
let's
say
it's
perfectly
fine
for
new
jersey
to
build
a
wharf
out
there,
but
they
can't
use
it
for
liquified
natural
gas,
which
delaware
may
conclude
poses
particular
problems
that
other
uses
don't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
how
come
your
position
in
my
murder
hypothetical
was
what
it
was?
because
i
assume
murder
is
not
a
riparian
use
either.
and
yet,
why
would
delaware
have
jurisdiction
over
a
casino
but
not
over
a
crime?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
here
decide...
under
your
view
the
case
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
use
of
the
wharf
for
a
liquified
natural
gas
terminal
is
a
traditional
riparian
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
let's
say
delaware,
it's
not
liquified
natural,
gas
but
it's,
you
know,
bulk
shipments.
is
that
a
traditional
riparian
right
that
delaware
could
not
prohibit
or
is
it
something
that
it
could
prohibit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
so
what
we
want
to
know
it
whether
or
not
there
are
constraints
in
the
compact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
permit...
a
permit
for
the
project
or
a
permit
for
the
wharf?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
what
does
the
1905
compact
give
new
jersey?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
left
under
your
reading
of
virginia
v.
maryland?
i
understood
that
case
to
say...
i
mean
it's
the
same
thing,
the
maryland
boundary
goes
to
the
low-water
mark
on
the
virginia
shore.
yet
this
court
held
that
that
did
not
include
police
power
to
prevent
the
particular
riparian
use
at
issue
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
case
here
as
well.
there's
no
doubt
that
new
jersey
under
the
compact
has
the
right
to
grant
riparian
rights,
including
wharfing
out,
that
go
beyond
the
low-water
mark.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
i
understand
our
decision
in
virginia
v.
maryland
it's
that
withdrawing
of
the
water
is
a
carve
out
of
maryland's
police
power
that
would
otherwise
apply.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
now
why
isn't
there
a
limited
carve
out
on
the
new
jersey
side
of
similar
riparian
rights?
in
other
words,
new
jersey
has
the
authority
to
authorize
wharfing
out
and
to
that
extent,
it's
a
carve
out
of
delaware's
police
power.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
that
work?
what
if
new
jersey
says
to
the
wharf
owners
you
must
dredge
around
your
wharf
because
we
think
it's...
you
know,
silt
is
depositing,
and
delaware
says
you
may
not
dredge
around
your
wharf
because
we
think
it's
going
to
disturb
the
oysters?
who...
how
do
you
concur
jurisdiction
work
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
something
they
do
have
the
authority
to
regulate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
farr,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
farr,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
as
purely
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--matter
of
curiosity?
the
parties
talk
about
the
duke
of
york's
grant
to
william
penn
in
this
case,
but
nobody
ever
explains
where
delaware
came
from.
how
did
that...
where
did
delaware...
i
mean
a
grant
to
william
penn
is
pennsylvania.
where...
when
did
delaware--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
