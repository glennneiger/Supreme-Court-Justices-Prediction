mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
the
1905
compact
between
delaware
and
new
jersey
did
not
settle
the
boundary
dispute
between
them,
new
jersey
nevertheless
agreed
to
dismiss
the
suit
that
it
had
filed
before
this
court
to
determine
the
boundary.
and
the
reason
for
those
two
seemingly
contradictory
facts,
i
think,
is
because
the
compact
did
resolve
permanently
certain
issues
of
jurisdiction,
implementing
rules
that
could
be
administered
without
regard
to
where
the
boundary
was.
thus
in
particular
article
vii,
the
provision
of
the
compact
that's
particularly
at
issue
in
this
case,
provided
that
each
state
could
continue
to
exercise
its
traditional
riparian
authority
over
the
riparian
owners
on
its
side
of
the
river
according
to
its
laws.
now,
the
special
master
i
think
fundamentally
changed
the
nature
of
the
compact
by
superimposing
the
boundary
line
into
the
terms
of
an
agreement
that
was
meant
to
operate
without
it.
and
i
think
he
did
so
because
he
mistakenly
applied
the
presumption
that
all
promises
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
and
territory
must
be
unmistakable;
and
this
court,
however,
had
said
several
years
before,
in
virginia
versus
maryland,
that
that
presumption
simply
is
not
applicable
to
compacts
that
are
entered
into
when
the
boundaries
between
the
states
are
disputed.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
several
things
about
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
language
"continue
to"
necessarily
brings
in
the
historical
antecedents
of
regulation
of
riparian
matters
by
both
states.
it's
undisputed
in
this
case
that
on
new
jersey's
side
of
the
river,
that
is
with
respect
to
riparian
owners
on
the
new
jersey
side,
new
jersey
had
exercised
full
and
exclusive
authority
over,
for
example,
wharfing
out
to
navigable
water,
the
building
of
piers
and
wharfs
to
do
that,
the
granting
of
lands,
without
any
involvement
whatsoever
by
delaware.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no.
i
think
what--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
history
doesn't
show
anything--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--specific
about
that
kind
of
law.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
without
the
compact
that
would
be
true,
but
i
think
what
the
compact
is
saying
is
that
you
get
to
retain
the
degree
of
power
on
your
own
side
of
the
river
that
you
had
before,
without
regard
ultimately
to
where
the
boundary
is
determined
to
be.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
souter,
i
think
that
the
difficulty
with
that
question
is
it
assumes
knowledge
of
where
the
boundary
is.
in
other
words,
when
one
talks
about
new
jersey
getting
a
new
power
to
grant
lands
that
are
within
delaware,
that
is
a...
that
is
a
question
that
necessarily
assumes
that
the
boundary
has
to
be
part
of
that
understanding.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
of
course.
it
is...
it
is
saying
"may
continue
to
grant
riparian
rights
and
lands
under
its
laws.
"
so
it
is
not
simply
the
language
"may
continue".
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
laws
have
to
refer
specifically,
obviously,
to
granting
delaware
land.
it
did
have
provision
for
granting
laws
beyond
the
low-water
mark
in
new
jersey.
many
of
the
grants
before
1905
specifically--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
what
i
think
you're
suggesting,
justice
souter,
i
think,
is
what...
what
fundamentally
alters
the
nature
of
the
compact
is
to
assume
that
new
jersey
had
certain
powers
up
until
the
time
the
boundary
line
was
determined,
and
then
it
lost
those
powers
after
the
boundary
line
was--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--you
see,
i
think
there
are
two
problems
with
that,
justice
souter.
first
of
all,
the
very
notion
that
there
would
be
something
left
if
the
boundary
line
was
determined
to
be
at
the
low-water
mark
on
the
new
jersey
side...
in
other
words,
that
article
7
would
continue
to
operate;
it
would
just
operate
subject
to
the
boundary...
at
least
in
the
context
of
the
riparian
right
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
right
to
wharf
out
to
navigable
water,
that
right
is
essentially
meaningless
if
you
stop
at
the
low-water
mark.
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
and
what
the
special
master's
recommendation
essentially
does,
it
says
new
jersey
has
no
right
to
authorize
wharfing
out
to
navigable
water
without
delaware's
consent.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--basically,
i
think
what
you
have
said,
justice
alito,
is
exactly
right.
it
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
depends
on
the
form
of
the
grant,
but,
typically,
if
new
jersey--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
conveys
an
interest
in
the
land
that
allows
the
doing
of
the
activity--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--for
which
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
because
delaware
has
essentially
said
in
article
vii,
we
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
new
jersey
may
continue
to
do
this.
it
was
doing...
i
mean
this
land--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
what
we
are...
what
we're
talking
about,
i
think,
is
we're
talking
about
granting
the
interest
in
land
that
is
necessary
for
the
riparian
owner
to
be
able
to
wharf
out.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
in...
in...
there
was
a
gambling
offense
at
the
end
of
a
pier
in...
in...
that
proceeded
from
the
new
jersey
shoreline,
in
19...
in
the
late
1950's
in
a
case
called
the
federenco
case,
which
i
don't
have
the
cite
for
immediately.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
held
that
that
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
new
jersey,
and
delaware
filed
a--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--delaware
filed
a
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
supporting
that
position.
so...
but
if
i
could
return
just
for
a
second
to
justice
souter's
point
and
justice
scalia's
point,
if
one
thinks
for
a
moment...
we're...
we're
trying
to,
i
think,
interpret
the...
the
1905
compact
as
it
must
have
been
understood
by
the
commissioners
who
drafted
it.
and
so
i
think
that,
unlike
the
special
master,
who
at
the
time
he's
interpreting
it,
knows
where
the
boundary
line
is,
we
have
to
think
about,
first
of
all,
would
the
commissioners
essentially
have
been
saying
to
new
jersey,
as
your
hypothesis
would
suggest,
that
each
state
on
its
own
side
of
the
river
has
the
right
to
grant
riparian
rights
and
lands
and
exercise
riparian
jurisdiction
subject
to
the
boundary
line,
which
for
new
jersey
would
mean
that,
in
fact,
if
it
lost
the
boundary
case,
it
would
effectively
have
no
riparian
jurisdiction
at
all?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
may
say,
the
quote
is
longer
than
that
and
in
a
critically
important
way.
it
says
it
may
not
do
that
"except
as
herein
expressly
set
forth.
"
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
mean,
obviously,
we're...
we're
debating
the
meaning
of
article
vii,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
article
vii
is
an
express
provision
herein,
meaning
in
the
compact.
so
that
what
article
vii
is
aiming
at,
it
seems
to
me,
if
we
are
correct
that
it
is
essentially
meant
to
operate
without
respect
to
the
boundary,
would
expressly
set
forth
a
cession.
and
i
might
point
out
that
when
this
case
was
before
this
court
or
the
two
states
were
before
this
court
back
in
1934,
delaware's
counsel
before
this
court
said
pretty
much
exactly
what
i'm
saying
this
morning:
that...
and
this
is
on
page
44
of
our
blue
brief,
but
said
that
the
compact
of
1905
in
his
view
ceded
to
the
state
of
new
jersey
all
the
right
to
control
the
erection
of
those
wharves,
meaning
wharves
that
were
constructed
by
new
jersey
riparian
owners
past
the
low-water
mark,
and
to
say
who
shall
erect
them.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
as
far
as
state
jurisdiction
goes,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
not
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
riparian
structures
such
as
piers
and
wharves
and
other
kinds
of
acknowledged
riparian
rights.
with
respect
to
matters
that
are
nonriparian,
for
example,
if
a
riparian
owner
in
new
jersey
wanted
to
construct
a
hotel
that
was
beyond
the
low-water
mark,
that
would
not
be
a
riparian
use.
and
delaware--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
i
think
what
you've
done,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
is
i
think
you've
detached
the
purpose
of
a
wharf
from
the
wharf
itself.
the
purpose
of
a
wharf
is
the
loading
and
unloading
of
goods.
that's
what...
what
they
are
used
for.
vessels
draw
up,
tie
up
and
unload
or
load
goods
and/or
passengers.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
under
state
law,
yes,
it
could,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
agree
with
that.
there's
no
question
that
it
is
subject
to
limitation.
the
question
is,
whose
laws
apply?
who...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
question
that
article
vii
expressly
answered.
article
vii
again
says
"each
state
on
its
own
side
of
the
river.
"
--which
is
not
a
designation
that
is
limited
by
the
boundary,
because
delaware
made
that
argument
to
the
special
master,
the
special
master
rejected
it,
and
delaware
did
not
file
exceptions
in
this
court.
so
"on
its
own
side
of
the
river.
"
i
think
is
properly
taken
to
mean
with
respect
to
the
riparian
owners
on
its
bank
of
the
river.
those
riparian
owners...
i
mean,
excuse
me...
"each
state
may
continue
on
its
own
side
of
the
river
to
exercise
riparian
jurisdiction
of
every
kind
and
nature,
make
grants
of
riparian
rights
and
land
under
the
respective
laws
of
the
states.
"
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
unfortunately,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
phrase
"toward
the
new
jersey
side".
i
mean,
between
the
low-water
mark--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
it's...
literal
ownership
of
the
land
begins
at
the
high-water
mark
on
the
new
jersey
side
and
ends
at
the
low-water
mark
on
the
new
jersey
side,
its
actual
ownership.
under
the
compact,
we
believe
delaware
has
ceded
to
it
the
right
to
grant
certain
interests
in
subaqueous
land
to
the
extent
but
only
to
the
extent
that
they
are
necessary
to
allow
owners
in
new
jersey,
riparian
owners,
to
exercise
riparian
rights,
provided
that
the
new
jersey
state
law
grants
them
that
right.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
they
were--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
again,
the
question
that
you're
asking
assumes
that
the
negotiators
were
coming
into
the
negotiation
with
their
boundary
positions
fixed
and
that
they
were
essentially
horse-trading
within
the
bounds
of
the
different
positions
taken
by
the
two
states.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
there's
the
possibility
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
what
i'm
suggesting
with
respect
to
this
narrow
category
of
riparian
rights.
just
as
that's
true,
for
example,
in
article
i.
new
jersey
has
the
right
to
serve
criminal
process
with
respect,
for
example,
to
crimes
that
occur
on
the
eastern
half
of
the
river,
which
is
something
that
new
jersey
clearly
would
not
have
had
if
it
ultimately
lost
the
boundary
dispute;
whereas
delaware
got,
in
article
ii,
the
authority
to
serve
process
for
crimes
occurring
on
the
western
half
of
the
river,
which
it
would
have
had
anyway,
whether
it
won
or
lost
the
boundary
dispute,
assuming
that
the
half
of
the
river
refers
to
the
channel.
so
i
mean...
let
me--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
exception--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
you've
asked
a
very
good
question,
but...
but
i
guess
i
think
it
is...
it's
quite
specific,
because
the
question
is,
what
do
the
terms
"on
its
own
side
of
the
river.
"
mean?
those
obviously
have
some
geographical
impact
here,
and
indeed
in...
before
the
special
master,
delaware's
position
was
yes,
that
is
a
geographical
designation,
but
what
it
means
is
"up
to
the
boundary
line".
in
other
words,
up
to
the
low-water
mark.
as
i
say,
the
special
master
rejected
that
position.
delaware
did
not
file
exceptions
from
that
position.
so
i
think
we
can
accept
at
this
point
in
the
case
that's
not
what
means.
so
the
question
then
is:
what
does
it
mean?
and
it
seems
to
me
what
it
means
is,
with
respect
to
the
riparian
property
owned
by
new
jersey
citizens
on
the
new
jersey
side
of
the
river,
delaware
citizens
on
the
delaware
side
of
the
river.
and
what
it
is
therefore
doing
is
saying
each
state
may
control
and
determine
the
rights
of
its
citizens
who
own
riparian
property--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--regardless
of
where--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
there
are
two
questions
there,
justice
stevens,
if
i
can
separate
them
for
a
moment.
as
far
as
state
law
goes,
purely
state
law,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
new
jersey
determines
what
can
and
cannot
be
done--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--on
a
wharf.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
under
state...
by
applying
delaware
state
law,
i
think
it
cannot
impose
any
limits.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
riparian
rights.
because
once
it--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
this
is,
i
think,
why
i
was
trying
to
separate
it
into
two
parts.
what
i've
left
out,
the
part
i've
left
out
so
far,
is
federal
law.
federal
law
has
a
significant
amount
to
say
about
what
happens
with
respect
to
piers
and
wharves--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--in
any
state.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
mean,
it
does
impose
a
limit,
but
we
don't
think
those
limits
are
valid
under
article
vii
of
the
compact.
i
think
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--no,
no,
they
cannot.
they...
what
this
does
is
it
says,
for
new
jersey
riparian
owners,
when
they
are
building
wharves
and
piers,
they
are
subject
to
the
laws
of
new
jersey.
"the
respective
states"
means
that
the
laws
of
one
state
or
the
laws
of
the
other
state,
depending
on
which
side
of
the
river
you're
on.
so
they
are
subject
to
new
jersey
law.
now,
obviously,
any
pier
or
wharf
that
interfered
with
navigation
interferes
with
the
federal
navigational
servitude.
so
that
would
be
subject
to
review
under
federal
law.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
i
would
say
it
does
have
a
right
there
because
that
is
not
a--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
not
a
riparian
use.
we're
talking
about--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--exactly.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
because
i
think
we're
talking
about
now
what
happens
with
respect...
i
mean,
if
we're
talking...
this
was
a
gambling...
it
wasn't
a
casino.
this
was
a
gambling
offense
that
took
place
on
a
facility
that
actually
was
used
for
the
loading
and
unloading
of
ships.
the
gambling
was
an
outside
activity
not
relating
to
the
use
of
the
wharf.
so
i
think
the
understanding
was
that
riparian
jurisdiction
of
every
kind
and
nature
would
be
sufficient
to
say,
once
you
have
built
the
wharf
and
it
is
a
legitimate
riparian
purpose
not
subject
to
delaware
laws,
then
new
jersey
would
apply
its
criminal
laws
as
well.
and
as
i
say,
delaware
filed
an
amicus
brief...
unfortunately,
we
don't
have
a
copy
of
it
in
the
record...
but
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
noted
that
delaware
supported
new
jersey's
jurisdiction
over
that
gambling
offense.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
assume--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
think
the
fact
is
that
this
is
why
one
needs
to
give
some
sort
of
practical...
take
a
practical
view
of
what
article
vii
is
talking
about.
article
vii...
the
two
riparian
rights
that
are
of
particular
interest
and
were
established
clearly
in
1905,
obviously
subject
to
the
state
limitations,
were,
first
of
all,
the
right
to
draw
water,
the
riparian
right
that
was
at
issue
in
virginia
v.
maryland,
where
the
court
said
maryland
can't
apply
its
police
power,
i
might
point
out.
the
second
was
piers
and
wharves.
obviously,
a
pier
and
a
wharf
that
stops
at
the
low-water
mark
is
of
no
use
at
all.
it's
got
to
get
out
to
the
navigable
water.
that's
where
the
ships
are.
it's
the
willie
sutton
principle.
so
once
have
you
that,
if
you're
going
to
have
riparian
rights,
you've
got
to
have
the
ability
to
grant
some
interest
in
lands
so
that
they
can
exercise
their
right
out
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
meaningful.
and
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
why--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--no,
that's
what...
i
mean,
"riparian
lands"
could
mean
the
lands
on
the
bank,
but
i
think
that's
not
what
they're
talking
about
in
this
context.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think,
because
of
the
context
here,
when
it's
linked
with
the
rights,
that
the
necessary...
the
limitation
that
justice
alito
mentioned
gives...
colors
it
essentially
to
say
this
is
what
we're
talking
about.
and
after
all,
this
is
similar--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct,
because
this
is
settling...
1
the
point
of
it
is
to
settle
and
avoid
future
controversy
with
respect
to
the
river,
and
those
are
the
lands
that
are
under
the
river.
if
i
could
reserve--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
true.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
true.
although
i
might
point
out
that,
as
the
weggle
declaration
says
in
the
record...
and
i
can
get
a
citation
to
that
in
a
moment,
it's
in
our
brief...
that
actually
is
a
relatively
small
amount
compared
to
much
dredging
that
went
on
prior
to
1905.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
the
delaware
river,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
not...
i
think
the
second
figure
may
be
short.
but
nonetheless,
i
don't
argue
with
the
premise.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
i
just
say
two
things,
and,
first
of
all,
something
that
we
haven't
really
talked
about
this
morning.
with
respect
to
matters
of
nuisance
and
all,
federal
law
provides
a
substantial
array
of
laws:
the
clean
water
act,
the
clean
air
act,
the
coastal
zone
management
act,
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
all
of
those
things.
anything
built
out
from
new
jersey
has
to
undergo
federal
review;
and,
subject
to
the
compact,
delaware
has
rights
to
participate
at
that
federal
level.
so
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
and
what
the
bill
of
complaint
deals
with,
is
the
question
of
whether
delaware
can
do
what
it
did
here,
which
is
apply
its
state
law
enacted
under
its
police
power
to
say
that
a
proposed
project,
riparian
project,
for
the
new
jersey
side
is
impermissible
and
cannot
be
built.
so
we
are
dealing
just
with
the
law
of
state
versus
state.
now...
so
i'd
like
to
suggest
if...
if
we
put
ourselves
in
the
shoes
of
the
commissioners
who
were
negotiating
this
compact
in
1905,
what
is
the
likely
reaction
if
article
vii...
if,
now,
delaware
had
proposed
at
the
time
that,
instead
of
the
language
as
it
is
now,
at
the
end
of
article
vii
the
words
were
added
"subject
to
the
police
power
of
the
other
state?
"
new
jersey
obviously
would
have
had
the
reaction
to
that
that
that
is
something
that
depends
on
the
boundary.
there
is
no
chance
that
new
jersey
is
going
to
be
able
to
exercise
any
police
power
on
the
delaware
side,
because
there
is
no
boundary
dispute
that
would
involve
that.
so
this
would
essentially
be
a
one-way
veto
that
delaware
would
be
trying
to
add
to
the
contract
to
say:
could
we...
we'll
be
able
to
override
any
riparian
structure
under
our
police
power.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
except
for
the
fact
that,
again,
if
we
put
ourselves
in
their
shoes,
it
seems
to
me
what
new
jersey
would
say
is:
if
you
are
proposing
that
you
can
veto
all
of
our
riparian
projects
using
your
police
power
because
of
your
view
of
the
boundary,
why
are
we
dismissing
the
case
that
we
just
filed,
or
filed
in
1877--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--to
determine
the
boundaries?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
to
the
extent
that
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
is
inconsistent
with
the
power
of
the
state,
the
authority
of
the
state,
to
authorize
a
pier
or
wharf
for
the
purposes
for
which
piers
and
wharves
are
used,
which
is
the
loading
and
unloading
of
goods.
if
that
is
what
the
state...
if
that
is
what
new
jersey
has
done,
that
is
not
subject
to
an
override
or
a
veto
by
delaware
exercising
its
police
power.
i
mean
this
was
an
important
value
at
the
time
that
the
compact
was
enacted,
and
new
jersey
would
not
have
lightly
let
delaware
veto
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
of
course.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
oh,
there
were...
i
think
there
were
further
grants
along
the
process
and
further
division
of...
of
territory.
i
think
some
of
that
is
actually
explained
in
new
jersey
v.
delaware,
too.
i
may
be
leading
you
in
the
wrong
direction,
but
i
don't
think
so.
