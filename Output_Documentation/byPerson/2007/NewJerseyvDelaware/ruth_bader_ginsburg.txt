mr.
farr,
one
of
the
striking
things
about
this
compact
is
that
to
the
extent
that
it
is
definite,
there
is
a
lot
in
here
in
detail
about
service
arrests
on
the
river
and
about
fishing,
but
then
you
get
to
these
two
articles
at
the
end
and
they
certainly
don't
have
that
same
definite
detailed
quality.
as
i
read
the
article
vii
that
you're
stressing,
it
says...
let's
see...
"may
continue
to
exercise".
so
it
seems
to
me
that
"may
continue
to"
was
just
whatever
was
the
status
quo,
that
will
continue;
not
to
do
anything
dispositive,
just
whatever
was
will
continue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
farr,
what
about
the
article
that
follows
article
vii?
article
viii
says:
"nothing
herein
contained
shall
affect
the
territorial
limits,
rights,
or
jurisdiction
of
either
state
in
or
over
the
delaware
river.
"
so
that's
a
qualification
at
least
on
every
other
article.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
i
don't
see
anything
expressly
set
forth
in
vii,
which
just
says
"may
continue
to",
which
says
the
status
quo
is
maintained.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
suggests--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
still
an
extraordinary
power
for
one
state
to
give
up.
if
delaware...
if
that
land...
they
didn't
settle
the
boundary,
but
it
might
be
on
the
delaware
side.
if
delaware
was
giving
up
so
much,
what
did
it
get
in
exchange?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i'm
not
assuming
that.
i'm
assuming
it's
unknown,
but
there
is
the
possibility
that
it's
going
to
end
up--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--end
up--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
a
possibility
that
it
will
end
up
on
the
delaware
side.
and
you're
suggesting
that
delaware
relinquished
all
of
its
regulatory
authority
and
gave
it
to
new
jersey,
no
matter
where
the
boundary
turned
out
to
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
was
in
fact
in
this
project,
was
there
not,
there
was
required
dredging
of
1.24
million
cubic
yards
of
submerged
soil
that
would
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the
delaware
side
of
the
boundary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
this
extended
out
more
than
any
prior
exercise
of
riparian
rights.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
this
was
going
to
be
2,000
feet,
and
the
greatest
extension
up
until
then
was
between
500
and
600.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
rather
recent
that
delaware
has
gotten
into
the
business
of
regulating
at
all.
i
thought
that
for
most
of
this
period
until
the
'60s,
delaware
just
wasn't
doing
anything
unless
something
was
a
nuisance,
and
that
didn't
come
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
talking
about
nuisance.
you're
talking
about
delaware's
environmental
laws.
that's
what
this
project
concerns.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
were
saying
delaware's
environmental
laws
trump
whatever
riparian
right
new
jersey
can
grant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
used
the
word
"riparian
jurisdiction".
we
have
riparian
rights.
that's
a
familiar
term.
riparian
jurisdiction
which
is
used
in
article
vii
is
a
novelty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
this
court
has
original
jurisdiction,
that
is,
it
serves
as
a
tribunal
of
first
and
last
resort
in
controversies
between
states
of
the
united
states,
and
this
is
such
a
case.
delaware
and
new
jersey
seek
this
court's
resolution
of
a
dispute
concerning
their
respective
governing
authority
over
a
portion
of
the
delaware
river
within
a
circle
of
12
miles
centered
on
the
town
of
new
castle,
delaware.
in
an
earlier
contest,
resolved
in
1934,
we
upheld
delaware's
claim
of
sovereignty
over
the
river
and
the
subaqueous
soil
within
the
circle
up
to
the
low-water
mark
on
new
jersey's
side.
prior
to
our
1934
boundary
determination
in
1905,
the
two
states
had
entered
into
a
compact
which
congress
subsequently
ratified.
the
1905
compact
accommodated
both
states'
concerns
on
matters
over
which
they
had
crossed
swords,
service
of
civil
and
criminal
process
on
vessels
and
rights
of
fishery
within
the
twelve-mile
zone.
although
the
parties
were
unable
to
reach
agreement
on
the
location
of
the
interstate
boundary
at
that
time,
the
1905
compact
contained
two
jurisdictional
provisions
relevant
to
the
current
dispute.
new
jersey
places
heavy
weight
on
article
vii
which
gave
each
state
on
its
own
side
of
the
river,
authority
to
convey
riparian
lands
and
rights
and
to
exercise
riparian
jurisdiction
of
every
kind
and
nature.
delaware
stresses
article
viii
of
provision
apparently
geared
to
the
still
unresolved
boundary
dispute,
absent
an
expressed
statement
to
the
contrary,
article
viii
states,
no
provision
of
the
compact
should
be
read
to
affect
the
territorial
limits,
rights
or
jurisdiction
of
either
state
over
the
delaware
river
or
the
ownership
of
the
subaqueous
soil
thereof.
this
third
and
perhaps
final
chapter
in
the
delaware
river
12
miles
circle
dispute
was
sparked
by
delaware's
refusal
to
grant
british
petroleum
a
permit
to
construct
in
the
river
a
liquefied
natural
gas
unloading
terminal.
the
terminal
would
extend
some
2000
feet
from
new
jersey's
shore
and
to
territory
over
which
delaware
is
sovereign.
it
would
comprise
a
6000
square
foot
unloading
platform
and
a
multipart
delivery
system
to
pipe
the
liquefied
gas
from
super
tankers
to
storage
and
processing
facilities
in
new
jersey.
relying
on
article
vii
of
the
1905
compact,
new
jersey
urged
that
it
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
projects
spreading
out
from
its
shores
including
wharves
extending
past
the
low-water
mark
on
new
jersey's
side
into
delaware
territory.
delaware
asserted
regulatory
authority
undiminished
by
article
vii,
over
structures
located
within
its
borders
like
the
liquified
natural
gas
unloading
facility.
in
support,
delaware
emphasized
article
viii
of
the
1905
compact
and
our
1934
decision
settling
the
boundary.
the
special
master
we
appointed
to
superintend
the
proceedings
recommended
a
determination
that
delaware
had
authority
to
approve
or
disapprove
the
proposed
liquefied
natural
gas
terminal
concurrently
with
new
jersey
to
the
extent
that
the
project
reached
beyond
new
jersey's
border
and
extended
into
delaware's
domain.
we
accept
the
special
master's
recommendation
in
principal
part.
article
vii
of
the
1905
compact,
we
hold,
did
not
secure
to
new
jersey
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
riparian
improvements
of
whatever
kind
commencing
on
new
jersey
shores.
the
parties'
own
conduct,
since
the
time
delaware
has
endeavored
to
regulate
coastal
developments,
supports
the
conclusion
to
which
other
relevant
factors
point,
delaware
has
authority
overlapping
new
jersey's
to
accept,
reject,
or
regulate
riparian
structures
and
operations
of
extraordinary
character
extending
outshore
of
new
jersey's
domain
into
territory
over
which
delaware
is
sovereign.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
alito.
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
