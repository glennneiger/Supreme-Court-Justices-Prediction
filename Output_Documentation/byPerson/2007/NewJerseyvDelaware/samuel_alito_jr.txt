what
right
do
you
think--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
right
do
you
think
new
jersey
has
now
with
respect
to
the
subaqueous
land?
is
it
simply
to
authorize
it
to
be
disturbed
to
the
extent
necessary
to
construct
a
wharf,
or
does
it
go
any
further
than
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
you're
eliminating
the
right
to
wharf
out.
before
1905,
new
jersey
was
allowing
the
construction
of
wharves,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
true...
we
can
look
and
see
what
was
authorized
or
not
before
1905.
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
ability
to
wharf
out
is
a
classic
american...
a
classic
riparian
right--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--under
u.s.
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
in
deciding
whether
to
allow
someone
to
wharf
out,
the
state
with
jurisdiction
would
decide
whether
the
wharf
was
consistent
with
state
objectives,
safety
objectives,
interference
with
navigation
and
so
forth?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
article
vii
says
that
each
state
on
its
own
side
of
the
river
may
continue
to
make
conveyances
of
riparian
rights.
so
why
doesn't
that
mean
that
each
state
is
continued...
continues
to
have
the
ability
to
authorize
the
wharfing
out
and
to
decide
whether
particular
wharves
are
consistent
with
the
state's
police
powers?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
separate
these
two,
then
the
riparian
right
is
worthless,
is
it
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
worthless
if
you
separate
those
two.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
say,
new
jersey
can
authorize
wharfing
out,
except
delaware
can
say
you
can't
wharf
out,
because
it's
inconsistent
with
our
police
power,
then...
then
the
authorization
to
allow
wharfing
out
is
meaningless.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what's
the
point
you
just
made
that
delaware
can't
prohibit
a
coal
wharf
but
it
cannot
prohibit
a
liquified
natural
gas
wharf?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--not
what
delaware
will
do
or
did
do.
can
it,
could
it
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
delaware
prohibit
a
coal
wharf?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
wouldn't
delaware's
police
power
allow
it
to
require
the
demolition
of
all
existing
wharfs?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
who
decides
whether
it's
a
nuisance?
if
delaware
says
that
docking
a
sailboat
is
a
nuisance,
who
decides
that?
does
all
of
this
have
to
be
decided
by
us
in
original
cases?
[laughter]
