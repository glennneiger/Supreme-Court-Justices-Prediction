mr.
farr,
is
there--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
there
a
limit
on
new
jersey's
rights?
as
long
as
it's
building
a
wharf,
can
it
do
anything
it
wants
to
on
that
or
is
there...
for
example,
could
it
dam
up
the
navigable
part
of
the
river
in
order
to
build
a
superstructure
on
the
wharf?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
i
should--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
should
rephrase
it.
to
what
extent,
if
any,
does
delaware
place
a
limit
on
the
way
in
which
new
jersey
may
exercise
its
riparian
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
limit
whatsoever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if...
even
if
the
building
of
the
wharf
interfered
with
the
navigation
on
the
river?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
just
asking,
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
delaware
law
place
any
limit
on
what
new
jersey
may
do
in
exercising
its
riparian
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
can
they
validly
impose
a
limit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
about
the
example
of
using
a...
setting
a
gambling
casino
or
something
at
the
end
of
the
wharf,
well
into
delaware
territory?
you'd
say
delaware
has
no
right
to
object
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
a
riparian
use.
justice
john
paul
stevens
anything
involving
loading
and
unloading
of
ships
and
so
forth
would
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
right
there,
mr.
frederick?
do
you
contend
that
they
may
no
longer
build
wharves
that
go
beyond
the
state
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
boundries
don't
matter
completely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
the
difference
between
withdrawing
water
as
not
being
subject
to
the
police
powers.
that
could
mean
they
could
drain
the
river,
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frederick,
does
the
riparian
right
include
the
right
to
dump
refuse
or
sewage
into
a
river?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
though
that
would
create
a
nuisance
across
the
river,
you
could...
they
still
would
have...
who
would
trump?
who
would
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
assuming
something
that
pollutes
the
river.
