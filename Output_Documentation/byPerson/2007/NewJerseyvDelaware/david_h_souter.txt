justice
david
h.
souter
so
your...
your
argument...
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
that
easy,
because
your
argument
is
assuming
that
by
virtue
of
the
"may
continue"
language,
the
state
of
new
jersey
acquires
a
new
power,
and
the
new
power
in
effect
is
to...
is
to
make
grants
of
subaqueous
land
that
belonged
not
to
new
jersey
but
to
delaware,
and
that's
the
stretch.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
such
an
extraordinary
position
or
proposition,
that
you've
got
to
have
something
more
specific
than
"may
continue"
in
order
to
construe
that
as
meaning
an
agreement
which
was
intended
to
give
new
jersey
the
power
to
grant
away
delaware
land.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
simply
saying
that
your
position...
and
i
accept
your
position...
that
the
compact
is
intended
to
continue
to
operate
whether
or
not
the
boundary
is...
is
ultimately
determined,
and
if
so,
after
it
is
ultimately
determined...
and
once
we
get
to
that
point
of
continuing
to
operate
after,
then
necessarily
the
only
way
it
can
operate
on
your
theory
is
to
give
new
jersey
the
power
to
grant
delaware
land.
and
if
new
jersey
has
that
power,
it
must
have
been
a
power
that
was
intended
in
the
1905
compact,
and
that
intent
strikes
me
as
a
very
extraordinary
intent;
and...
and
my...
the
point
of
my
question
was
the
application
of
the
compact
in
the
new
circumstances,
as
you
claim
it
to
be,
would
be
so
extraordinary
that
you
ought
to
have
language
more
specific
than
"may
continue"
in
order
to
establish
that
extraordinary
result.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
emphasize
"under
its
laws",
then
don't
you
lose?
because
new
jersey
does
not...
i
presume
new
jersey
does
not
have
law,
for
example,
in
its
constitution,
providing
that
it
can
grant
delaware
land.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i'm
going
on
the
assumption
that
it,
in
fact,
had
jurisdiction;
that
it
had
land
below...
beyond
the
low-water
mark.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
didn't
so
much
lose...
i
mean
it
had
a
generalized
recognition
of
power.
in
order
to
exercise
that
power,
it
had
to
possess
certain
attributes,
i.e.,
land.
once
it
lost
that
land,
it
had
nothing
to
exercise
the
power
over.
in
fact,
it
had
a
little
bit
left.
it
had
the
distance
between
the
high
and
the
low-water
marks,
so
it
still
had
the
power.
but
the...
the
recognition
of
the
power
in
1905
was,
in
effect,
a
formula;
and
the
formula
depends
on
facts
to
be
applied;
and
the
facts
changed
once
the
boundary
was
determined.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
delaware
took
the
position
that
there
simply
is
the
maximum
amount
of
allowable
building
in
the
river,
and
from
now
on
it
will
not,
in
fact,
agree
to
grant,
authorize,
whatever
the
title
is,
any
further
wharves
and
piers
on
new
jersey's
side?
does
delaware
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
passed
a
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
statute
effective?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
talking
about
a
new
statute.
delaware
says
enough
is
enough;
no
more
wharfs
and
piers
from
the
new
jersey
side.
is
that
statute
effective
and
enforceable?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
mr.
frederick,
if
the...
if
the
legislature
of
delaware
passes
that
statute,
i
assume
they
intend
it
to
mean
what
it
says.
and
as
against
a
claim
by
new
jersey
or
on
behalf
of
a
new
jersey
grantee,
is
that
delaware
statute
effective?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
depends
on
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
forget
the
federal
right
now.
we're
talking
about
construing
a
compact.
so
far
as
this
compact
is
concerned,
so
far
as
the
domestic
laws
of
the
two
states,
new
jersey
and
delaware,
are
concerned,
would
the
delaware
statute
be
effective?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
asking
you
what
delaware
would
say.
i
think
i
can
imagine
what
delaware
would
say.
i
want
to
know
whether
delaware
would
prevail
when
it
got
here--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
is
before
there
was
all
these
wharves
were
out
here,
and
delaware
is
now
saying
the
facts
have
changed.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
again,
you're
changing
the
hypothetical.
your
answer,
i...
the
answer
that
you
just
gave,
i
presume
would
be
the
same
whether
delaware
had
passed
any
particular
statute
regarding
wharfage
from
the
new
jersey
side
or
whether
it
had...
you
were
giving
an
answer
which
took
into
consideration
the
compact
but
which
basically
depended
upon
we'll
call
it
the
general
riparian
law.
the
question,
however,
is
the
effectiveness
of
a
delaware
statute
directed
specifically
to
this
issue
that
says
"no
more".
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
your
answer
to
justice
alito
is,
tell
me
more
about
the
circumstances
and
i
will
then
give
you
an
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
understood
your
earlier
answer
to
be
exactly
what
justice
scalia
said.
are
you
now
saying
that
delaware
can
prevent
it
only
on
the
grounds
of
preventing
a
nuisance?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
saying
whether
that
would
be
a
classic
exercise.
is
that
the
only
circumstance
in
which
it
can
be
exercised,
or
conversely,
does
delaware
have
the
authority
to
say
no
simply
because
it
says
no?
i
thought
your
answer
the
first
time
around
finally
was
the
latter.
it
can
say
no.
and
i
think
that's
what
my
brother
scalia
thought.
now
are
you
saying
it
can
say
no
only
if
there
is
a
nuisance
or
some
other
specified
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
can
limit
it,
i
presume,
subject
to
some
reasonable
rule
of
health
and
safety?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
it
simply
cannot
say
as
a
matter
of
legislative
view
case
no
more
wharfs?
