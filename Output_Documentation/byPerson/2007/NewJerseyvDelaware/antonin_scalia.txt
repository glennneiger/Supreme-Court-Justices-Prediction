justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
clear
that
new
jersey
believed
when
it
had
authorized
somebody
to
wharf
out,
that
the
person
who
wharfed
out
was
not
subject
to
new
jersey's
environmental
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
history
doesn't
show
anything
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it...
if
it
would
have
been
subject
to
new
jersey's
environmental
laws,
had
new
jersey
owned
the
bed
of
the
river
into
which
the
wharf
was
extended,
by
parity
of
reasoning
it
seems
to
me
the
wharf
would
be
subject
to
delaware's
environmental
laws
if
delaware
owns
the
bed
of
the
river.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
have
a
more
basic
question.
assume...
assuming
that
the
subaqueous
land
belongs
to
new
jersey
and
that
new
jersey
gives
a
private
individual
a
right
to
wharf
out
into
the
delaware,
does
that
individual
acquire
ownership
of
the
land
under
the
water,
assuming
new
jersey
owns
the
subaqueous
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
normally,
authority
to
wharf
out
doesn't
convey
the
land
with
it;
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
wharf.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
wharf.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if...
if
merely
authority
to
wharf
out
would
not
even
convey
new
jersey's
own
land,
how
can
you
argue
that,
by
reason
of
this
compact,
it
implicitly
conveyed
what
is
now
delaware's
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
continue
to
wharf
out,
but
not
continue
to
grant
subaqueous
land,
which
you
say
doesn't
go
with
wharfing
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
new
jersey...
could
new
jersey
prevent
its
use
for
liquified
gas?
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
but
new
jersey
had
given
this
riparian
owner
the
right
to
wharf
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
obviously,
the
right
to
wharf
out
does
not
include
the
right
to
use
the
wharf
for
whatever
you
like,
and
the
only
thing
we're
arguing
about
is
whether
it
is
new
jersey
or
delaware
that
can
impose
limitations.
but
that
it
is
subject
to
limitation
is,
it
seems
to
me,
absolutely
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
farr,
could
you
tell
me...
one
thing
in
article
vii
perplexes
me.
why
does
it
say
that
each
state
may
"make
grants,
leases,
and
conveyances
of
riparian
lands
and
rights?
"
"rights"
i
can
understand.
but
why
would
they
say
"conveyances
of
riparian
lands"?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
obviously
each
state
can...
riparian
lands
are
within
each
state.
nobody
questioned
that
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
"riparian
lands"
means
the
land
under
the
wharf?
that's
a
strange
use
of
"riparian
lands".
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
other
instance
where
people
talk
of
riparian
lands
and
they
mean
land
extending
under
the
water?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
position,
that
"lands"
means
the
lands
under
the
water?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
asking
about
under
this
thing.
forget
about
the
commerce
clause.
and
it's
obvious
what
the
purpose
of
the
hypothetical
is.
you're
saying
that
to
give
you
the
right
to
wharf
out
does
not
mean
that
you
can
use
the
wharf
for
any
purpose
that's
contrary
to
the
police
power
prescriptions
of
delaware.
that
is
reasonable
enough.
well,
what
if
one
of
the
police
power
prescriptions
is
you
can't
have
a
wharf?
now,
you
know,
can
you
flatly
contradict
what
article
vii
says?
and
i
really
think
you
ought
to
give
that
one
away.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
wharf
that
didn't
go
beyond
a
low-water
mark?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
they
do,
jump
onto
the
land?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
a
wharf
that
is
just
ugly
is
okay.
your
answer
to
justice
souter
is,
delaware
can't
say
no
more
wharfs.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
mr.
frederick,
you
say
that
the...
that
the
police
power
of
delaware,
despite
article
vii,
includes
the
power
to
require
you
to
get
a
license
before
you
can
wharf
out
from
the
new
jersey
shore?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
delaware
can
say
no
you
can't
wharf
out
unless,
you
get
a
license
from
us,
despite
article
vii.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
goes
beyond
the
boundary.
if
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
other
side
of
the
boundary
you
don't
need
article
vii.
new
jersey
can
allow
anything
to
be
done
up
to...
up
to
the
low
water
mark,
but
you're
saying
that
despite
article
vii
delaware
can
say
no,
you
cannot
wharf
out
until
you
get
a
license
from
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you've
just
read
article...
article
vii
out
of
the
compact.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
gives
nothing
to
new
jersey.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
they
can
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
it
pays.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
new
jersey
does
not
have
full
property
in
the
shore
of
the
delaware?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
that's
no
basis
for
distinguishing.
what
else
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
it's
up
to
maryland
what's
a
concern.
if
maryland
doesn't
want
any
water
taken,
why
isn't
that
a
valid
exercise
of
maryland's
police
power?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
even
acknowledge
that.
you
deny
even
that.
you
have
said
that
delaware
can
prevent
the
wharfing
out
and
say
you
can't
wharf
out
unless
you
get
a
license
from
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
he
is
not
done.
as
a
matter
of
police
power,
however,
they
can
do
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
one-way
pass.
why
shouldn't
it
be
a
one-way
veto?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
give
delaware
anything.
