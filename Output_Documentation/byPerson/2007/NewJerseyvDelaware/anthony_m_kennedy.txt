justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
you
asking
us
to
reject
the
concept
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
all
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
your
view
to
what
extent
does
this
involve
subaqueous
lands
toward...
and
i'll
just
put
"toward"...
the
new
jersey
side?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
position
on
where
new
jersey's
jurisdiction
begins
and
ends
with
reference
to
subaqueous
lands.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's...
article
i...
that's
an
exception.
and
you
don't
have
the
benefit
of
that
exception
when
you're
talking
about
article
vii.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
exception
is
not
that
specific
as
to
the...
as
to
the
extent
of
the
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
you're
running
away
from
the
hypothetical.
i
have
the
question
that
justice
souter
has,
basically
to
what
extent
does
concurrent
jurisdiction
apply,
what
are
the
limits
that
we
will
apply
in
later
cases
to
implement
this
concept
of
concurrent
jurisdiction?
in
the
laws
of
some
states
you
can't
overburden
an
easement.
if
you
give
a
power
company
an
easement,
it
can't
put
huge
300-foot
structures
on
the
easement
without
taking...
is
that
the
kind
of
analysis
that
we
have
to
apply
in
order
to
make
your
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
the
master's
concurrent
jurisdiction
theory
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
assumes
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
wharf.
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
police
power
means
that
there
cannot
be
a
wharf
if
new
jersey
says
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
seems
to
me
inconsistent.
if
delaware
says
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
saying
that
new
jersey
has
a
right
to
wharf
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
where...
what...
where
do
you
draw
the
line,
what
is
your
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view
a
riparian
right
exists
only
to
say
whether
there
should
be
a
wharf.
the...
the
state
with
jurisdiction
over
the
riparian
right
has
no
interest
in
what's
going
to
happen
on
that
wharf,
or
what
the
wharf
is
going
to
look
like?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
case...
and
i
could
ask
mr.
farr
the
same
question...
do
i
consult
in
order
to
give
content
to
the
term
riparian
rights?
where
can
i
see
what
the
substance
of
riparian
rights
is,
in
the...
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
or
in
other
leading
decisions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
state
of
new
jersey
allow
the
wharf
to
be
built
for
some
unspecified
purpose,
just
let
it
stick
out
there
until
it
decides
what
it
wants
to
do
with
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
a
hypothetical,
could
it
do
that?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
would
be
a
very
stupid
riparian
use,
but
could
it
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
saying
that
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
are
saying
that
the
concept
of
"riparian
rights"
displaces
the
police
power,
to
a
large
extent.
