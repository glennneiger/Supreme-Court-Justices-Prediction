mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
can
be
summarized
in
two
words:
boundaries
matter.
boundaries
determine
where
states
can
make
grants
of
land,
and
they
determine
where
a
state
can
exercise
its
police
powers.
and
with
respect
to
both
principle,
the
special
master
got
it
exactly
right.
nothing
in
article
vii
or
elsewhere
in
the
compact
of
1905
precludes
the
state
of
new
jersey
from
exercising
its
police
powers
within
the
boundary
determined
by
this
court
in
its
1934
boundary
decision.
and,
in
fact,
at
291--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
our
position
is
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
they
can...
under
delaware
law,
a
riparian
owner
in
new
jersey
can
extend
past
the
low-water
mark
as
has
been
permitted
by
new
jersey,
by
delaware
in
every
single
instance
since
1961
when
delaware
enacted
subaqueous
land
laws,
except
the
two
times
where
new
jersey
riparian
owners
sought
to
violate
delaware's
laws
by
building
lng
facilities:
in
1972
when
the
el
paso
company
sought
to
build
an
lng
facility
and
was
denied
by
delaware
and
new
jersey
acquiesced
in
that
denial,
and
then
in
2005
when
delaware
made
the
status
determination
that
the
crown
landing
facility
was
a
prohibited
bulk
transfer
facility
precluded
by
delaware
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
delaware
can
exercise
its
police
authority
as--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
statute
is
not
effected
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
give.
nothing
in
delaware
subaqueous
land
laws
goes
to
clutter,
visual
or
otherwise,
on
the
bank.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
statute
would
be
subject
to
delaware
takings
law,
and
delaware
has
found
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
depends.
justice
souter,
it
depends.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitution
of
delaware.
a
private--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
delaware
statute
would
not
be
affected
by
the
1905
compact,
justice
souter,
because
delaware
would
assert
presumably,
if
defending
that
law,
that
it
was
subject
to
regular
police
power
restrictions.
but
those
police
power
restrictions--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
that
delaware
would
prevail
on
a
blanket
prohibition
of
the
exercise
of
riparian
rights
by
new
jersey
landowners.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
delaware
has
always
permitted
the
exercise
of
riparian
rights
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--delaware
certainly
has
the
power,
under
our
theory
of
the
case
as
recommended
by
the
special
master,
to
implement
its
police
powers.
those
police
powers
are
always
subject
to
constitutional
constraints.
and
under
the
hypothetical
you
posed,
as
extreme
as
it
is,
justice
souter,
the
constitution,
both
under
delaware
law
and
under
the
united
states
constitution,
might
well
say
the
state
has
gone
too
far
in
exercising
its
police--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i'm
not
sure
that
you
would
need
to
go
that
far,
certainly
in
light
of
the
practical
realities
of
the
150
years
of
shared
use
of
the
delaware
river,
justice
kennedy.
importantly,
under
new
jersey's
theory,
to
go
to
your
hypothetical,
justice
souter,
where
the
entire
bed
of
the
river
within
the
twelve-mile
circle
would
be
built
out,
that
would
be
a
functional
abrogation
of
this
court's
boundary
decision,
because
this
court
held
that
the
land
under
the
piers
was
not
belonging
to
new
jersey
and
that
an
attempt
to
extend
the
entire
boundary
outward,
water-ward,
would
be
overriding
what
this
court
determined
was
the...
easement.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
becomes
a
dormant
commerce
clause
problem,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia,
under
a
broad
theory
of
where
the
boundary
is
in
matters,
it
would
require
new
jersey
to
have
access
to
grant
delaware
lands.
and
under
our
theory
as
accepted
by
the
special
master,
that
would
not
be
permitted.
if
it
is
simply
a
question
of
use,
we
would
acknowledge
that
the
new
jersey
riparian
owner
can--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--there
were
only
two
proven
in
the
record,
justice
alito,
and
neither
of
which
was
proved
in
this
record
to
go
beyond
the
low-water
mark.
but,
yes,
you're
right.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
parts
of
the
twelve
mile
circle--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
in
parts
of
the
twelve
mile
circle,
justice
scalia,
particularly
in
gloucester
county,
there's
marshy
area
where
the
low-water
area
extends
hundreds
of
feet
into
the
river.
and
that
is
where
the
boundary
is...
is
determined.
and
it
was
not
necessary
in
some
places
within
the
twelve
mile
circle
to
go
beyond
the
low-water
mark
in
order
to
build
a
pier--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--certainly.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
certainly.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
justice
alito.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
last
part
of
your
question,
justice
alito,
is
where
the
rub
lies,
because
riparian
law
was
subject
to
the
individual
determination
of
what
a
riparian
right
was,
and
how
the
state's
regulation
of
that
right
as
a
private
property
right
would
be
determined.
what
this
court's
cases
uniformly
hold
is
that
the
police
power
trumps
that
private
riparian
right,
and
this
was
recognized
by
the
attorney
general
for
new
jersey.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
because
wharfing
out
is
always
dependent
on
whether
or
not
it
is
so
far
into
the
river
to
impede
the
navigable
channel,
to
become
a
nuisance,
and
none
of
the
cases
by
this
court
talking
about
wharfing
rights
concern
the
police
powers
issued
by
the
state.
cummings
v
the
city
of
chicago
held
that
the
federal
riparian
right
given
to
the
wharf
owner
in
chicago
was
not...
could
not
override
a
state's
determination
of
how
the
wharf
could
be
built,
that
police
power.
hudson
v
mccarter--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
are
not
going
that
far,
justice
kennedy.
what
we
are
saying--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--a
wharf
that
impedes
navigation
is
a
nuisance
that
is
subject
to
classic
police
power
restrictions.
a
wharf
that
does
not
have
any
of
those
consequences
is
permitted
and
delaware
has
permitted
those
wharves.
in
fact
even
recently
when
the
state
of
new
jersey
petitioned
to
delaware
to
obtain
a
permit
for
the
fort
mott
state
recreational
park,
delaware
granted
that
to
them.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
delaware
cannot
say
no
more
wharfs,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
that's
really
at
the
rub
of
this
case,
which
is
what
you
do
on
the
wharf.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
all
of
the
law
and
evidence
suggests
that
it
is
not.
in
fact,
the
riparian
grants
that
new
jersey
issued
after
its
wharf
act
of
18
never
contained
a
specification
of
use.
they
admitted
in
the
record--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--delaware
has
permitted
that.
the
keystone
facility
allows
for
bulk
shipments
of
coal
to
be
delivered
and
offloaded
within
the
twelve
mile
circle.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
are
distinctive
rights.
it's
like...
it's
like
zoning
laws,
justice
kennedy.
you
can
own
a
piece
of
land
but
that
does
not
mean
that
you
can
override
the
police
powers
of
the
state
by
what
you
do
on
land.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
delaware's
subaqueous
lands
act
makes
that
distinction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
as
a
matter
of
police
power--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--delaware
has
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it...
yes.
it
could.
that
if...
if
it
were
deemed
to
be
a
proper
exercise
of
its
police
authority,
yes,
it
could.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
the
answer,
justice
souter,
is
not
decided
by
the
facts
on
the
case
here
but
rather
on
the
individual
circumstances.
i
appreciate
that
there
are
hypotheticals
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--indeed.
because
there
are
constitutional
constraints.
there
are
dormant
commerce
clause
considerations.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
compact
does
not
contain
the
constraints,
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
recognized
it,
and
this
is
at
the
appendix
starting
at
905
of
the
delaware
appendix.
in
1867
in
new
jersey,
attorney
general
robeson
issued
a
very
lengthy
and
scholarly
opinion
on
the
difference
between
the
powers
that
a
state
could
exercise
over
riparian
rights,
and
he
distinguished
in
that
opinion
between
what
he
called
the
great
public
uses,
which
would
be
for
defense,
for
the
environment,
for
protection
of
the
people's
safety,
and
what
were
deemed
to
be
public
uses.
those
who
would
be
using
those
riparian
lands
for
a
railway
bridge
or
a
terminal
that
would
be
for
commercial
purposes.
and
he
said
that
in
the
instance
of
the
great
public
uses,
there
would
not
be
a
need
to
pay
compensation
because
that
great
public
right
overrided
the
riparian
proprietor's
exercise
of
riparian
right.
with
respect
to
the
public
use,
however,
and
this
is
at
page
910
to
911
delaware's
appendix,
he
said
that
with
respect
to
those
public
uses,
there
might
be
a
requirement
for
a
taking
or
a
payment
of
compensation.
and
so
justice
souter,
i
appreciate
that
our
position
has
a
frustration,
in
the
sense
that
it
does
require
individual
facts.
but
i
would
submit
to
you
that
in
the
160
years
in
which
the...
new
jersey
citizens
have
been
wharfing
into
the
delaware
river,
delaware
has
permitted
that
in
every
single
instance,
except
two.
and
there
are
both
liquified
natural
gas
facilities.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is
correct
that
delaware
regulated
by
the
common
law,
justice
ginsburg,
but
as
the
special
master
correctly
found
just
because
the
limitation
under
the
fx
judicial
precedents
is
for
nuisances
does
not
mean
there
is
no
regulation.
when
delaware
chose
to
override
its
common
law
riparian
jurisdiction
by
implementing
statutes,
new
jersey
acceded
to
them
to
the
point
that
in
its
consideration
of
coastal
zone
management
laws
in
the
1970s,
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
was
specifically
consulted
whether
compliance
with
the
federal
statute
and
delaware
statutes
was
necessary.
and
in
1980
issued
a
coastal
zone
management
plan,
new
jersey
did...
that
recognized
that
if
there
was
an
lng
facility,
the
agreement
of
both
states
was
necessary.
the
deponents
in
this
case,
every
single
one
of
them
from
the
new
jersey
side,
including
persons
who
had
worked
for
the
state
for
nearly
30
years,
said
that
the
entire
time
they
had
worked
for
the
state,
if
the
project
crossed
the
boundary
there
had
to
be
a
permit
obtained
from
the
state
of
delaware.
we
would
submit
that
the
constant--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
the
wharf
extended
beyond
the
boundary
line,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
permit
for
the
wharf,
and
that
permit--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
gives
new
jersey
the
right
to
say
who
shall
be
the
riparian
owners
to
exercise
their
rights,
what
they
can
do,
and
up
to
the
point
where
there
would
be
an
encroachment
of
the
police
power
of
the
state,
the
permission
to
do
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
leading
decision
of
this
court,
justice
kennedy,
is
a
case
called
shively
v
bowlby,
which
was
decided
a
few
years
before
the
1905
compact;
and
in
that
case
this
court
went
through
an
exhaustive
determination
to
show
what
the
riparian
rights
were,
state
by
state
by
state.
the
purpose
there
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
oregon
riparian
land
owner
had
rights
that
were
consistent
under
oregon
common
law
with
those
granted
in
a
deed
by
congress,
and
in
order
to
do
that
the
court
went
through
a
very
long
examination
and
analysis
of
riparian
rights
as
they
existed
in
all--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i'm
saying
yes,
that
under
delaware's...
no,
it's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
it
goes
beyond
the
boundary,
that
is
the
position
new
jersey--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
have--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
there
are
prohibited
uses,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
you
have
to
get
a
license
under
new
jersey
law,
too,
and
that's
the
whole
point
of
state
officials
by
new
jersey
saying
compliance
had
to
be
with
both
laws.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
protects
the
new
jersey
landowners
who
in
the
interregnum
between
the
1905
compact
and
this
court's
boundary
determination
would
have
faced
the
uncertainty
that
their
grants
would
be
deemed
puerperous
by
delaware.
what
this
court
said
in
its
boundary
decision
was
that
the
mere
use
of
those
was
recognized
by
delaware
under
the
common
law,
was
not
deemed
to
be
a
nuisance,
but
in
this
court's
decision
in
coffee
versus
groover,
a
grant
made
by
a
state
that
does
not
have
lawful
title
to
the
land
would
be
deemed
invalid.
that
case,
which
was
decided
in
the
late
1880s,
invalidated
grants
that
had
been
made
by
the
state
of
florida
at
a
time
when
the
boundary
was
uncertain.
and
this
court
said
that
those
grants
were
invalid
in
light
of
the
uncertain
title
that
the
state
had
when
it
made
those
grants.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
those
would
be
deemed
takings,
justice
alito.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
it
can
be
acquired
by
compensation,
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
decision
in
virginia
v.
maryland
is
distinguishable
in
a
number
of
ways,
and
if
i
could
take
a
moment
to
go
through
those
ways.
the
first
is
that
it
involved
a
different
compact
with
different
language.
the
1785
compact
between
virginia
and
maryland
specifically
provided
that
each...
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
have
"full
property
in
the
shores
of
the
potomac
river.
"
the
court
construed
the
phrase
"full
property"
to
include
riparian
rights.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
black-jenkins
award
issued
to
resolve
the
boundary
line
was
decided
in
1877.
and
in
that
arbitration
decision,
maryland
specifically
represented
that
the
boundary
should
be
drawn
around
the
wharves
that
were
on
the
virginia
side
of
the
boundary
so
that
the
boundary,
instead
of
being
at
the
low-water
mark,
would
carve
out
every
pier
that
had
been
constructed.
the
arbitrators
rejected
that,
but
in
the
process
provided
that
the
riparian
owners
on
the
virginia
side
could
go
beyond
the
low-water
mark...
that
is
a
direct
quote...
"beyond
the
low-water
mark
to
exercise
their
riparian
rights.
"
congress--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
doubt
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
what
the
phrase
"own
side"
means.
and
we
think
the
better
reading
of
own
side
is
captured
by
the
grants
part
of
the
special
master's
recommendation
is
that
own
side
means
the
boundary.
but
to
the
extent
that
a
right
can
be
exercised,
a
riparian
right
authorized
by
new
jersey
beyond
the
low-water
mark,
it
is
still
subject
to
the
police
powers.
and
at
page
10
of
the
special
master's
report
in
virginia
v.
maryland,
the
special
master
specifically
said
this
case
does
not
concern
the
exercise
of
the
police
powers,
but
rather
the
mere
withdrawal
of
the
water.
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
the
types
of
general
police
powers
that
would
apply
to
the
riparian
right.
and
finally,
i
would
note
that
the
special
master
was
the
same.
he
was
uniquely
positioned
in
this
case
to
assess
the
applicability
of
virginia
v.
maryland
because
he
had
been
the
special
master
in
that
case,
too.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
what
the
court
held
and
what
was
decided
in
that
case
was
that
the
taking
of
the
water
by
virginia
was
not
to
the
level
where
it
would
give
rise
to
the
kind
of
police
concern
that
maryland
might
express.
the
court
left
that
issue
open.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
would
be
a
valid
exercise,
but
i
was
answering
mr.
chief
justice's
question
about
what
is
left
of
it.
and
the
question,
what
is
left
of
it
is
that
virginia
can
continue
to
withdraw
water
from
the
potomac
river.
whether
there
should
be
a
problem
in
the
future
about
overwithdrawing
or
an
exercise--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
would...
it
would
be
a
limited
carve
out,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is
a
limited
carve
out
to
the
extent
of
permitting
the
wharfing
out,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
it
is
a
nuisance
you
cannot
get
a
license.
that
is
classic
riparian
law,
mr....
justice--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i'm
saying
yes.
that
would
be
a
classic
exercise
of
riparian--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--let
me
try
it
this
way.
as
a
limitation
of
a
riparian
right,
the
state
of
delaware
can
limit
the
length
of
the
wharf,
whether
the
wharf
goes
in
ordinary
circumstances,
but
as
to
a
prohibition,
it
cannot
do
so
unless
it
is
a
nuisance
as
a
matter
of
riparian
jurisdiction.
as
a
matter
of
police
power--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
the
state
can
limit
the
activities
that
can
occur
on
the
wharf.
and
that
is
the
crucial
distinction
here.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
typically
the
corps
of
engineers
determines
that
issue
as
a
matter
of
application
of
the
1899
rivers
and
harbors
appropriations
act.
section
10
of
that
act,
justice
alito,
the
corps
of
engineers
has
the
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
docking
or
wharfing
in
a
navigable
waterway
of
the
united
states
would
constitute
a
nuisance
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
environmental
laws
would
apply
to
the
project.
the
position
of
delaware
is
not
that
bp
can't
build
its
wharf.
it's
that
it
can't
engage
in
a
prohibited
use
on
that
wharf.
the
wharf
itself
is
not
a
nuisance.
it
does
not
violate
any
normal
standard
of
riparian
use.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
as
i
matter
of
both
states'
laws,
justice
kennedy,
that's
not
how
either
state
does
it.
both
states
now
require
as
part
of
the
environmental--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
that,
yes,
it
could
do
that
if
its
intent
was
to
achieve
access
to
the
navigable
waterway.
but
both
states,
both
new
jersey,
outside
the
twelve-mile
circle,
and
delaware
apply
police
powers
now
so
that
permits
have
to
be
required
when--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
is
an
easy
one,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
new
jersey
has
conceded
that
it
does
not
have
the
authority
to
regulate
dredging
within
the
twelve
mile
circle.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
the
point.
riparian
jurisdiction
is
quite
limited.
it
concerns
only
certain
aspects
of
the
riparian
owner's
access
to
the
waterways,
and
that
limitation
of
that
property
right
has
been
recognized
for
centuries
by
this
court
and
others
courts.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i'm
using
it
in
the
term
that
the
special
master
did
it,
which
is
the
state's
jurisdiction
to
govern
the
exercise
of
riparian
rights.
it
is
not
a
term
of
art.
farnham's
treatise,
which
is
another
source
of
where
riparian
rights
traditionally
have
been
recognized,
did
not
use
that
phrase,
and
the
parties
could
not
find
any--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
is
a...
yes,
it
is
a
part
of
the
classic
riparian
right,
intakes
and
discharges,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
police
power
would
prevail
on
that,
because
what
you
dump
is
what...
is
where
everything
matters.
if
the
dumping
is
simply
water
that
doesn't
have
any
ecological
effects,
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
would
be
subject
to
the
environmental
laws.
that's
classic
police
power
recognized
by
this
court
in
hudson
v.
mccarter.
