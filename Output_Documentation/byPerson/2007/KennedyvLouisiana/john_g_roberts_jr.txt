chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-343,
kennedy
versus
louisiana.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
speaking
of
roper
and
atkins,
is
it...
is
it
only
work
in
one
way?
how
are
you
ever
supposed
to
get
consensus
moving
in
the
opposite
direction?
in
other
words,
you
look
to
the
number
of
states
under
roper
and
atkins
who
impose
it,
and
you
say,
well,
most
of
them
are
abolishing
it,
so
we
think
it's
unconstitutional,
combined
with
other
factors.
now,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
trend
the
other
way,
how
does
that
happen?
as
soon
as
the
first
state
says,
well,
we're
going
to
impose
the
death
penalty
for
child
rape,
you
say,
well,
there
isn't
a
consensus,
so
it's
unconstitutional.
and
do
20
states
have
to
get
together
and
do
it
at
the
same
time?
or
how
are
they
supposed
to
move
the
inquiry
under
atkins
and
roper
in
the
opposite
direction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
trend
since
1995,
'90,
has
been
more
and
more
states
are
passing
statutes
imposing
the
death
penalty
in
situations
that
do
not
result
in
death.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask...
we
will
put
that
to
one
side,
but
how
much
movement
you
need.
i'm
more
interested
in
the
analytic
question:
how
does
it
happen?
i
mean
because
your
position
would
be
every
one...
a
case
in
every
one
of
those
states,
whatever
the
number
is,
is
unconstitutional
because
we've
said
the
trend
is
the
other
way.
well,
how
does
a
trend
ever
get
started
in
the
opposite
direction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
want
to
say
this
is...
you
want
to
say
this
is
unconstitutional
because
most
states
do
it
the
other
way.
and
i
assume
if
a
similar
case
arose
in
texas
involving
capital
punishment
in
a
nondeath
case,
you
would
say
well,
most
go
the
other
way.
in
other
words,
if
you
knock
them
down
one
by
one,
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
get
a
trend
going.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
somebody
in
this
case
is
tried
and
convicted
under
that
law,
you
would
say:
well,
that's
unconstitutional
because
there
is
not
a
sufficient
trend
in
favor
of
that.
and
it
just
seems
to
me
that
that
understanding
of
atkins
and
roper
prevents
the
development
of
the
law
except
in
one
direction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but,
as
i
pointed
out,
it
is
very
expensive
to
run
a
regime
in
which
you
have
the
death
penalty.
and
i
can
see
the
legislators
in
those
states
saying,
well,
we've
got
coker
on
the
books.
we've
only
got
one
state.
why
would
we
want
to
be
the
second
state
and
go
through
this
process
and
then
have
the
supreme
court
throw
it
out?
you
know,
everyone
is
waiting
for
the
next
state.
i
mean
it's
a
very
difficult
process,
it
seems
to
me,
to
run
the
evolution
of
the
law
in
both
directions.
and
then
if
you're
insisting
on
a
trend
of
whatever...
i
don't
know
what
the
number
is,
15,
or
20,
or
30
states...
it
just
can't
materialize
when
you
have
coker
there
and
you
have
atkins
looking
only
in
one
direction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
wonder
if
atkins
and
roper
are
qualitatively
different,
considering
the
mental
retardation
of
the
offender,
the
youth
of
the
offender.
those
are
issues
that
go,
as
we
said
in
roper
and
atkins,
to
culpability.
in
other
words,
they
are
focused
on
the
offender.
this
is
quite
different.
it
is
focused
on
the
nature
of
the
offense.
and
i
wonder
if
that's
more
something
on
which
we
have
less
basis
for
determining
the
issue
than
a
legislature.
we
can
look
at
the
question
of
characteristics
of
the
offender
and
make
a
judgment
about
that.
i
don't
know
how
we
decide
this
for
the
reason
you
were
just
saying:
what
crimes
are
more
serious
than
others?
i
wonder
if
it
brings
into
play
our
jurisprudence
on
things
like
the
three-strikes
law
and
others
where
we
sort
of
say:
we
can't
judge
how
serious
crimes
are
and
which
ones
are
more
serious
than
others,
and
so
we
leave
that
to
another
branch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we're
talking
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
were
talking
about
evolving
trends,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
society's
recognition
of
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
of
rape
has
evolved
even
since,
the
period
since
coker.
now
isn't
that
something
that
we
should
take
into
consideration?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
certainly
involved...
evolved
since
the
time
of
blackstone
and
even
since...
as
i
say,
even
since
coker.
so
while
coker
may
have
thought
rape
of
an
adult
wasn't
serious
enough
to
warrant
the
death
penalty
when
the
legislature
had
made
a
contrary
determination,
perhaps
that
would
be
addressed
differently
if...
differently
today;
and
certainly
rape
of
a
child
would
be
understood
not
to
be
not
included
in
coker's
analysis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
coker,
of
course,
repeatedly
in
the
statement
of
the
facts
and
the
analysis,
repeatedly
referred
to
the
victim
as
an
adult
woman.
it
seems
to
me
the
court
was
taking...
was
being
very
careful
to
leave
open
the
question
of
what
would
be
the
analysis
in
the
case
of
a
child.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
ms.
clark.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
it
sufficient...
why
isn't
it
sufficient
narrowing,
even
after
coker,
that
they
make
the
death
eligibility
rape
of
a
child
under
12
as
opposed
to
under
16?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
clark.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
cruz?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cruz.
mr.
fisher,
we'll
give
you
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
thought...
the
bulk
of
your
argument,
though,
it
seems
to
me,
would
not...
would
be
the
same
in
a
recidivist
case,
because,
of
course,
that
doesn't
result
in
death
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
i
don't...
it
is
sort
of
a
factual
distinction
but
i
don't
see
how
it
helps
your
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
sort
of
trends
that
they
look
to
in
roper
and
atkins...
i
mean,
you
had
different
crimes
that
carried
the
capital
punishment
as
well.
i
don't
think
we're
looking
at
trends
in
that
regard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
07-343,
kennedy
versus
louisiana.
