justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no...
there
is
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
particular
kind
of
crime
has
not
been
the
subject
of
a
supreme
court
opinion.
my
problem
is
i
can
think
of
many,
many
awful,
truly
horrible
circumstances
that
categorized
in
many
different...
under
many
different
criminal
statutes;
i'm
not
a
moralist.
i'm
a
judge.
as
a
judge,
i
look
at
the
law.
it
seems
for
43
years,
no
one
has
been
executed
but
for
murder.
moreover,
this
court
has
never
approved
the
execution
for
any
crime
other
than
murder
in
those
43
years.
right.
if
i
accept
your
argument,
since
i'm
not
a
moralist,
since
i
can
think
of
horrible
things
all
over
the
place,
have
i
then
opened
the
door
so
that,
in
fact,
states
will
find
lots
of
different
crimes
which
are
seriously
horrible;
and
suddenly,
we
will
be
in
the
business
of
creating
under
the
constitution
some
kind
of
highly
complex
categorization,
really
a
moral
categorization
of
crime,
method
of
commitment,
method
of,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
answer
is
yes?
your
answer
is
if
we
take
your
position
and
that's...
i'm
not
saying
it's
not
a
good
argument,
just
take
your
position,
but
if
we
take
your
position,
i
can
think
of
instances
of
kidnapping;
i
can
think
of
instances
of
torture.
i
can
think
of
instances
all
over
the
place
which
are
truly
horrible.
but
then
to
take
your
position,
what
we're
going
to
do
is
we
are
going
to
say
legislatures
all
over
the
country
do
have
the
right
under
the
constitution
to
go,
try
to
categorize
horrible
by
horrible,
not
just
death.
not
just
murder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
perhaps
at
the
time,
200
years
ago,
that's
true.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
not
true...
i've
read
the
definition
of
section
41
of
rape
under
the
louisiana
code.
i
won't
repeat
it
but
it's
very
broad.
and
it
can
broad
in
the
sense
that
rape
itself
can
include
a
vast
number
of
instances
of
child
molesting,
each
of
which
is
bad;
but
there
are
degrees.
so
i
suppose
that
child
molesting
of
all
those
kinds
that
are
listed
in
41
(c)(1)
and
(2),
which
you
know
i'm
sure,
would
count
as
rape
if
committed
on
a
person
under
12.
some
are
absolutely
horrible.
some
are
just
bad.
but
that's
what
the
other
side
means
when
he
says
it
gives
tremendous
discretion
to
the
prosecutor
to
pick
and
choose
who
should
be
executed
needs
further
narrowing.
what's
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
are
the
only
two.
so
these
other
things
don't
count.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you...
can
you
give
me
one
second
on
my
own
error
here,
but
i
just
traced
the
statute
through.
what
i
did
was
i
looked
at
section
42.
it
says,
"aggravated
rape
is
a
rape
committed
upon,
et
cetera.
"
and
then
it
says
"where
the
victim
is
under
the
age
of
13.
"
right.
so
it
doesn't
say
what
rape
is.
so
i
assumed
it
picked
up
the
definition
of
rape
from
section
41.
and
section
41
defines
rape
as
anal
or
oral
or
vaginal
sexual
intercourse,
and
then
in
section
three
it
defines
oral.
now
am
i
right;
is
that
the
correct
statutory
thing,
or
is
there
some
other
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
go
back
to
my
if
that
is
the
right
statutory
thing,
because
it
seems
to
cover,
particularly
in
its
definition
of
oral
intercourse,
a
very
wide
range
of
child
molesting,
all
of
which
i
agree
is
quite
bad,
but
it's
still
a
very,
very
wide
range.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
it
wasn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean,
my
question
relates
back
to
what
justice
souter
was
talking
about,
about
the
narrowing
of
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
started
out
by
saying
it's
the
worst
cases
of
child
abuse,
and
that's...
child
rape...
and
that's
why
i
was
interested
in
the
definition.
it
seems
to
me
this
definition
simply
covers
all
instances
of
some
kind
of
physical
intercourse
with
a
child,
including
oral,
vaginal,
anal.
i
can't
imagine
one
that
wouldn't
be
covered
if
the
victim
of
this
is
under
the
age
of
13.
now,
am
i
right
in
thinking
it's
not
the
worst
instances;
it's
every
instance
of
rape
defined
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
amendment--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thank
you.
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
will
you
give
us
one
sentence
or
two
on
the
response
to
all
the
professionals
who've
commented
in
the
briefs
in
saying
the
death
penalty
here
will
make
this
situation
worse?
