mr.
r.
ted
cruz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
few
evolving
standards
of
decency
are
more
pronounced
that
the
growing
understanding
in
modern
society
of
the
unique
and
irreparable
harm
caused
by
violent
child
rape.
from
jessica's
laws
to
megan's
laws
to
the
laws
at
issue
here,
elected
legislatures
have
repeatedly
acted
to
deter
and
to
punish
violent
child
rape.
in
particular,
the
legislatures
of
seven
states
have
determined
that
the
very
worst
child
rapists
should
be
eligible
for
the
most
serious
punishment.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
talking
about
the
effect
of
coker.
and
justice
kennedy,
you
raised
in
particular
the
dual
aspects
of
coker.
what
we
suggest
the
effect
of
coker
is,
is
that
it
has
been
under
a
cloud
of
confusion.
a
fair
reading,
a
careful
reading
of
coker
in
my
judgment,
it's
clear
coker
does
not
reach
this
instance.
the
court
bent
over
backwards
to
explicitly
specify
that
it
was
adult
rape,
and
indeed
the
question
presented
in
the
briefing
in
coker
not
use
the
word
adult
rape
at
all.
it
was
phrased
generally
in
terms
of
rape,
and
the
court
repeatedly
and
i
would
suggest
not
accidently
added
the
word
adult.
but
that
being
said,
the
states
have
operated
since
coker
under
a
great
deal
of
confusion
as
to
what
exactly
coker
meant.
and,
indeed,
in
1981
the
florida
supreme
court
struck
down
their
law
believing
that
it
was,
quote,
"compelled"
by
coker.
and
the
state
legislatures
when
they
act
today...
in
the
state
of
texas...
texas
is
the
most
recent
state
to
even
act
one
of
these
laws.
when
the
state
legislature
was
considering
it,
the
state
legislature
asked
the
attorney
general's
office
for
advice
specifically
on
whether
coker
allowed
that.
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
confusion.
as
petitioner
argues
quite
passionately,
those
that
are
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
for
child
rape
argue
vociferously
that
coker
does
not
allow
it,
as
petitioner
has
done
in
many,
many
pages
of
briefing.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
you're
not
exactly
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
statute
that
is
being
challenged
in
this
case
was
the
pre-amended
statute.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
so
oral
was
not
in
it.
and
it
wasn't
13;
it
was
12.
so
the
statute
under
which
patrick
kennedy
was
convicted
was
only
vaginal
or
anal
rape.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
exactly.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
exactly
rate.
and
so
that
was
a
substantial
narrowing.
it
was
11
and
younger,
and
it
was
only
vaginal
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--and
anal.
beyond
that,
however,
the
juries
that
have
considered
this
so
far...
and
it
has
been
a
limited
circumstance
because
of
the
distorting
effect
of
coker...
but
the
juries
that
have
considered
this
so
far
and
the
prosecutors
that
have
prosecuted
have
shown
every
ability
to
distinguish
truly
egregious
rapes.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
kennedy,
petitioners
assert
that
that
is
the
case,
that
a
plea
bargain
has
been
offered
in
every
instance.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
source
of
that
assertion,
but
at
least
with
respect
to
the
state
of
texas,
we
don't
have
information
one
way
or
the
other
in
terms
of
the
conduct
of
louisiana
prosecutors.
what
we
can
say
is
that
the
cases
that
have
been
prosecuted...
the
two
individuals
currently
on
death
row,
patrick
kennedy
and
mr.
davis,
committed
crimes
that
are
just
unspeakable.
and
in
both
of
them,
they
were
not
children
that
were
close
to
the
age;
they
were
in
this
case
an
eight-year-old
little
girl;
in
patrick
kennedy's
case,
a
five-year-old
child.
they
were
crimes
that
were...
and
that's
part
of
the
evolving
concept
of
decency.
part
of
the
reason
the
states
are
acting
is,
in
modern
times,
we're
seeing
crimes
that
20,
30,
40,
years
ago,
people
wouldn't
imagine.
we're
seeing
predators
that
seek
out
young
children
and
do
abominable
things
to
them.
and
that's
why
legislatures
are
acting.
i
will
point
out
mr.
fisher
speculated
that
if
this
court
made
clear
that
coker
does
not
prevent
a
narrow
statute
focused
at
child
rapists,
he
speculated
that
the
states
would
not
act.
i'm
standing
here
on
behalf
of
nine
states.
there's
an
additional
state,
missouri,
that
is
implicated;
there's
the
state
of
louisiana.
you
have
11
states.
and
i
say
i
find
that
speculation
extremely
difficult
to
believe.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
those
professionals...
that
is
their
opinion
on
a
difficult
policy
question.
the
amici
states
are
not
here
advocating
that...
that
capital
punishment
for
child
rape
is
or
isn't
a
terrific
idea.
what
we
are
advocating
is
that
there
is
an
evolving
understanding
of
the
enormous,
unique,
irreparable
harms
to
children,
and
it's
elected
legislatures
that
can
sit
and
listen
to
those
advocates
from
the
groups,
listen
to
the
empirical
data,
consider
the
deterrence
effect...
consider
all
of
these
and
decide
one
way
or
the
other.
i
would
fully
expect,
in
time,
some
states
would
act
to
establish
capital
punishment
and
others
would
not.
and
that
that's
precisely
how
the
laboratories
of
democracy
should
operate.
with
respect
to
the
decisions,
the
prior
decisions,
that
this
court
has
had
in
atkins,
in
roper,
and
aldo
tison
and
enmund,
i
think
all
of
those,
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
are
about
culpability.
they
are
about
saying...
atkins
and
roper
both
dealt
with
a
class
of
offenders
that,
for
characteristics,
had
limited
culpability.
in
this
instance,
patrick
kennedy
is
a
300-pound
man
who
violently
raped
an
eight-year-old
girl.
on
any
measure,
he
is
exquisitely
culpable.
and
the
question,
as
this
court
put
it
in
roper,
as
to
the
eighth
amendment
inquiry
as
to
the
death
penalty
is
whether
the
offender
can
be
reliably,
quote,
"be
classified
among
the
worst
offenders.
"
under
almost
any
analysis,
someone
who
commits
the
sort
of
unspeakable
crime
that
patrick
kennedy
commits
is
reliably
classified
among
the
worst
offenders.
i
would
point
out...
a
question
justice
stevens
asked,
you
know,
has
any
nation
internationally
gone
backwards?
it's
interesting
if
you
look
at
the
history
in
england.
england
actually
has
gone
back
in
force.
blackstone
actually
talks
about
how
rape
under
saxon
law
was
punishable
by
death,
and
then
there
was
a
period
1285
where
the
punishment
was
relaxed
to
loss
of
the
eyes
and
testicles.
that
was
william
the
conqueror's
kinder,
gentler
version.
[laughter]
and
blackstone
describes,
quote,
"that
previous
lenity
being
productive
of
the
most
terrible
consequences,
it
was
subsequently
necessary
to
return
to
making
it
a
capital
offense.
"
and
so
england
had
that
history.
it
is
not
presently
a
capital
offense
in
england.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i'm
not
aware
of
a
decision
doing
so,
but
the
analytical
predicate
for
the
evolving
standards
of
decency...
this
court
said
over
and
over
again
the
most
reliable
indicium
is
the
objective
judgment
of
elected
legislatures.
and
in
this
instance,
the
legislatures--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
kennedy,
there
are
three
possible
narrowing
factors
that
occur
to
me.
we
would
submit
the
statute
is
sufficiently
narrow
as
drafted,
but
beyond
that,
the
one
that
has
been...
the
four
states
that
have
most
recently
acted
have
used
recidivism
as
a
narrowing
factor.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
prior
conviction.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
correct.
there
are
two
other
narrowing...
narrowing
aggravators
that
could
be
applied.
one
would
be
especially
heinous
or
vile
rapes.
the
aggravated
rape
that
justice
powell
discussed
in
his
coker
opinion,
a
really
brutal
case,
which
both
florida
and
georgia
have...
i
would
note
petitioner
says
patrick
kennedy
could
not
be
convicted
in
any
other
state.
in
florida
and
georgia,
if
they
concluded
that
his
violent
rape
requiring
surgery
to
correct
was
especially
violent
and
heinous,
he
could
be
convicted
in
either
of
those
states.
or,
finally,
there
could
be,
as
in
lowenfield,
an
aggravator
for
multiple
victims.
some
of
the
worst
of
these
child
rapists
rape
more
than
one
child.
and
so
that
is
another
potential
aggravator
that
a
state
could
choose.
