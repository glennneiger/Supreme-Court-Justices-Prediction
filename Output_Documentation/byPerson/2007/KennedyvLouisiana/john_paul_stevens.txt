justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
just
clarify
about
the...
were
those
injuries
permanent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were
not
permanent
injuries.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
looking
for
time,
let
me
ask
you
one...
one
question
that
interests
me
but
is
a
little
divorced
from
the
terms
of
the
arguments
so
far.
i
know
it
is
not
popular
to
refer
to
refer
to
international
commentary
on
issues
like
this,
but
the
english
law
lords
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
discussing
the
international
principle
that
nations
that
retain
the
death
penalty
may
not
extend
the
death
penalty
to
crimes
to
which
it
does
not
presently
apply.
they
suggest
that
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
there's
sort
of
a
correspondence
to
our
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
have
generally
governed
our
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence.
it's
kind
of
a
one-way
rachet,
we
look
at
trends
in
one
direction
but
we
don't
look
to
see
if
you
suddenly
have
changed
gears
and
go
in
the
other
direction.
could
you
just
comment
on
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
asking
that.
i
just
used
that
as
an
analogy
to
our
evolving
standards
of
decency
cases
which
has
been
part
of
our
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
that
sort
of
is
a...
one
way
direction
in
which
these
cases
go.
do
you
think
it's
appropriate...
are
you
aware
of
any
case
saying
we
can
turn
around
and
go
in
another
direction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
know
more
about
the
crime
now
than
we
did
40
years
ago?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
has
that
sort
of
a
different
direction
from
evolving
standards
of
decency
occurred
at
all
since
we
first
announced
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
and
jurisprudence
in
this
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
about
the
comment
on
the
international
community's
view
that
it
is
really
a
one
way
rachet?
mr.
cruz:
you
know,
the
law
lords'
brief...
i
have
to
admit
personally
i
found
really
quite
astonishing,
and
i
was
harkened
back
to
some
of
the
issues
this
court
considered
in
the
medeillin
case
because
the
law
lords'
brief
argued
that
the
united
states...
that
this
court
has
no
ability
to
determine
that
any
other
crime
is
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
and
there
were
two
bases:
one
was
a
treaty
that
the
united
states
has
never
ratified.
and
secondly
was
this
inchoate
international
law
understanding
that,
because
other
nations
have
made
a
policy
determination
about
the
death
penalty,
that
it
is
forbidden
to
the
u.s.
congress,
it
is
forbidden
to
the
states
of
the
united
states,
and
it
is
forbidden
to
this
court
to
ever
acknowledge
there
is
a
crime
that
is
consistent
with
our
constitution.
that
brief,
to
my
mind,
embodied
all
of
the
dangers
of
the
very
broad
arguments
that
we're
being
presented
in
medeillin,
that
ultimately
the
constitutional
and
the
people
of
this
country
determine
what
is
permissible
and
what
is
lawful.
this
court
has
chosen
to
look
to
other
nations
for
guidance,
but
that
brief
didn't
say
this
is
guidance.
that
brief
said
the
united
states
is
foreclosed
from
ever
doing
this
because
other
nations
have
made
determinations
under
their
law.
