ms.
juliet
l.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
very
savage
rape
of
an
8-year-old
child
by
her
stepfather.
he
raped
her
so
brutally
that
he
tore
her
entire
perineal
opening
from
her
vaginal
opening
and
to
her
anal
opening.
he
tore
her
vagina
on
the
interior
such
that
it
separated
partially
from
her
cervix
and
allowed
her
rectum
to
protrude
into
her
vagina.
invasive
emergency
surgery
was
required
to
repair
these
injuries.
it
is
louisiana's
position
that
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
preclude
the
state
of
louisiana
from--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--your
honor,
those
injuries,
after
surgery
they
did
heal.
so
the
surgery
was
required
to
repair
them.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
in
the
sense
that
they
healed,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
was
a
performance
injury
inflicted
upon
a
child
wants...
just
psychologically
and
mentally
as
well
as
physically.
as
an
initial
matter,
i
would
like
to
address
the
coker
question.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
coker
was
limited
to
the
rape
of
an
adult
woman.
there
are
at
lease
14
separate
references
in
the
opinion
to
an
adult
woman
or
to
an
adult
female.
the
only
reference--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--yes,
your
honor,
i
understand
that...
that
sort
of
a
tension,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
for
the
defendant,
he's
the
one
asking
the
court
to
create
this
broad
categorical
restriction
and
he's
saying
that
it
clearly
precludes
it.
at
the
same
time
he's
saying
that
states
have...
have
responded
to...
to
coker,
that
somehow
that...
the
fact
that
there's
not
a
greater
existence
of
the
rape
of
a
child
rape
laws
is
somehow
not
controlled
by
the
fact
that
it
has
been
misinterpreted,
and
he
point
out
in
his
brief
several
instances
of
courts
where
they
specifically
misinterpret
that
holding.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
your
honor,
i
think
the
constitution
by
only
precluding
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
there
are
certain
crimes
that
by
their
nature
are
so
heinous
that
the
death
penalty--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
with
child
rape
there
is
something
very
unique
and
horrible
about
this
crime.
it's
not
true
of
every
kidnapping.
it's
not
true--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--your
honor,
i'm
slightly
confused
as
to
what
you're
referring
to
in
terms
of
a
wide
variety
of
acts,
because
louisiana
revised
statute
3
14:
42
that
patrick
kennedy
was
convicted
under,
it
only
provides
that
he
could
be
convicted
of
aggravated
rape
of
a
child
under
12
where
he
had
anal
intercourse
or
vaginal
intercourse
with
that
child.
those
are
the
only
two
methods--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
only
anal
or
vaginal
rape.
and
i
would
submit
that
that
is
in
itself
a
very
narrow
crime.
this
is
fundamentally
different,
i
think,
from
homicide,
where
in
homicide
the
narrowing
was
required
because
homicides
were
committed
under
circumstances
where
the
offender
himself
perhaps
lacks
intent
to
kill
traditionally,
but
accidentally
committed
the
murder
during
the
course
of
another
felony.
or
where
the
offender
himself
acted
with
reckless
disregard
but
another
person
committed
it
during
the
course
of
the
felony.
so
there
was
a
wide
variety
of
intents
with
which
the
crime
was
committed.
there
was
a
wide
range
of
circumstances
under
which
the
crime
was--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
the--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
about
murder
about
the
category
being
so
broad,
the
class
being
so
broad,
the
range
of
actions
being
so
broad
that
when
the
court
was
looking
at...
in
furman...
what
kind
of
homicides...
how
do
we
know
whether...
why
this
person
is
getting
the
death
penalty
and
why
this
person
isn't,
what
is
the
standard
that
guides
it,
they
were
looking
at
situations
where
murders
like
the...
ini
furman
his
actions
were
described
as
tripping
over
a
wire
as
you
left
the
house
and
accidently
shooting
the
homeowner
through
the
front
door.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
louisiana
law
we
define...
we
have
deliberate
murder,
a
law
enforcement
official,
and
that
by
the
category
of
the
victim
that
is
at
stake
there
that
crime
is
narrowed,
and
that
is
provided
for
in
louisiana
law.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
that
is.
that's
further
narrowing.
it
is,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
it
is
not
clear
from
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
narrowing
would
be
required
in
a
non-homicide
circumstance
to
begin
with,
especially
one
where
here
we
have
defined
the
offense
so
narrowly
that
it
is...
that
under
the
law
that
patrick
kennedy
was
convicted
it
was
only
children
under
12.
those
kind
of
offenses,
rapes
under
those
circumstances
are
not
committed
accidentally.
they're
never
committed
without
some
form
of
premediation
and
deliberation.
it's
just
something
that
is
fundamentally
and
uniquely
different
for
murder.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
i...
if
i
understand
what
you're
asking,
with
regard
to
murder
again,
murder
traditionally
is
a
very
broad
crime.
so,
i
think
what
louisiana
did
is
they
defined
murder
to
account
for
many
ways
in
which
it
could
be
committed.
they
labeled
one
class
of
them
as
being--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--well,
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
though
i
think
that
perhaps--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--well,
not...
i
agree
in
the
sense
that--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--yes,
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
i
think,
if
i
can
address
this
perhaps
without
a
specific
yes
or
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
the
homicide
statute
draws
specifically
a
large
class
and
specifically
narrows
it.
the
rape
statute
in
itself
narrowly
defines
the
target
group
without
making
reference
to
the
broader
class.
i
think
is--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
actually,
in
caddo
parish,
the
man
who
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
there
had
a...
had
a
female
cohort,
so
to
speak
who
was
involved
in
the
rape
with
him,
who
i
believe
has
not
been
tried
yet;
but
she
participated
in
the
rape
with
him,
and
therefore
as
a
principal
who
with
specific
intent
is
alleged
to
have
committed
the
offense
as
well.
so
both
male
and
female
could
be
convicted
of
this
offense,
if
he
commits
this
offense,
and
both
male
and
female
children
could
be
victims
of
this
offense;
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--well,
first
of
all,
i
certainly
recognize
that
there
are
approximately
28
international
countries
that
would
permit
the
death
penalty
for
rape.
however,
this
court
in
its
jurisprudence
has
never,
ever
based
its
determination
solely
upon
that
factor.
in
certain
instances,
the
court
has
looked
to
that
to
confirm
its
own
decision
in
the
matter,
but
it's
never
been
controlling.
i
would
point
out,
though,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
that...
that
there
are
no...
there
are
no
treaties
that
are
controlling
upon
the
united
states
or
this
court
that
would--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--i
think
we
can,
especially
where,
as
here,
that
turn-around,
that
determination
is
based
upon
a
unique
understanding
of
how
this
crime
seriously,
gravely
affects
children
in
a
manner--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--well,
i
think
that
we
do.
i
think
that
that
is
solely
reflected
in
the
child
pornography
laws
that
have
come
about
since
then.
in
osborne
versus
ohio,
the
court
said,
after
coker,
you
can't
even
possess
child
pornography
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home.
so
i
think
that...
because
it
is
so
harmful.
and
i
think
that
that
along
with
megan's
law,
i
think
that
those
sort
of
cases
are
also
recognition
of
the
fact
that
we
now
know
more
about
this
crime.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
that
is
the
correct
statutory
thing.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
i
was
trying
to
make
this
clear--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--well,
i
think
that
all
sexual
intercourse
is...
i
think
that's
a
pretty
definite
offense,
despite--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--but
also
i
would
suggest
that
the
point
is
here
is
that
patrick
kennedy
was
not
convicted
under
that
provision.
he
was
convicted
under
the
earlier--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--right.
right.
i
would
agree
that
some
of
the
definition
of
the
offenses
was
narrower
under
the...
terms
that
patrick
kennedy
was
convicted
under
than
it
is
today.
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
in
enmund
what
the
court
was
looking
at
was,
when
the
court
addressed
the
issue
it
didn't
simply
say
a
human
life
wasn't
taken.
it
went
on
to
look
at
is
robbery
itself,
the
underlying
offense,
a
crime
serious
enough
to
warrant
the
death
penalty?
in
tison,
the
court
was
trying
to
address
what
are
the
limits,
i
believe
of
the
felony
murder
doctrine
as
applied
to
homicide
when
the
defendant
himself...
what...
what
participation
in
the
offense
did
he
have
to
reach
that
level
in
which
he
would
suffer
the
death
penalty.
i
think
that's
very
different
from
a
case
like
this
where
the
offender
absolutely
committed
the
offense,
where
the
offender
absolutely
does
not
act
by
accident
or
without
premeditation
or
deliberation,
and
directly
causes
that
terrible
harm
himself.
i
think
the
verdict--
ms.
juliet
l.
clark
--thank
you,
your
honor.
