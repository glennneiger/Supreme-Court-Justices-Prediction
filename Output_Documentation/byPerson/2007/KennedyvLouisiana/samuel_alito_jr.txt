do
you
think
that
all
these
other
states,
if
told
that
it
is
permissible
to
have
the
death
penalty
for
child
rape
at
least
under
some
circumstances,
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
worst
case
of
child
rape
that
can
be
envisioned
is
still
less
heinous
than
any
murder
that
qualifies
for
the
death
penalty?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
plurality
opinion
in
coker
said
this:
life
is
over
for
the
victim
of
the
murderer.
for
the
rape
victim,
life
may
not
be
nearly
so
happy
as
it
was.
now,
you
think
that's
something
that
would
be
written
today?
