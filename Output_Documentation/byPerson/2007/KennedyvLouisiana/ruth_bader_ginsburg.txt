can
you
go
over
that,
mr.
fisher?
because
the...
there
was
a
plurality
opinion,
right,
in
coker?
and
justice
powell
wrote
separately,
and
i
thought
he
left
open
an
outrageous
rape
resulting
in
serious,
lasting
harm
to
the
victim.
he
said
that
the
coker
jury
was
not
asked
and
could
not
have
found
from
the
facts
in
that
case
that
the
offense
was
outrageous
or
want
only
violent
in
that
it
involved
a
aggravated
battery.
so
you
don't
have
an
opinion
of
five
justices
saying
that,
in
any
and
all
circumstances,
rape
that
leaves
the
victim
alive
cannot
be
punished
by
the
death
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
questioning...
you're
saying
it's
off
the
chart
because
the
court
held
that
you
cannot
have
a
death
penalty
for
rape.
and
i
suggested
that
that's
not
so
clear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
any
rate--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
were
four
justices
on
the
plurality
opinion.
that
was
the
only
point
i
wanted
to
make.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
brief
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
several
states,
and
the
argument
that's
made
in
that
brief
on
the
point
that
the
chief
justice
has
raised
is
we
can
never
know
whether
there
is
a
consensus
one
way
or
another
so
long
as
coker
seems
to
cover
the
waterfront,
so
long
as
coker
admits
of
the
interpretation
that
you
cannot
have
the
death
penalty
for
rape,
period.
so
the
argument
is
on
this
question...
not
talking
about
the
universe
of
crimes,
but
as
to
rape...
we
cannot
know
if
there
is
a
consensus
one
way
or
another
until
this
court
clarifies
what
coker
stands
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was,
at
least
in
the
amici
briefs
in
coker...
may
not
have
been
explicit
in
the
court's
decision...
but
the
argument
was
made
that
the
rape
law
in
question,
the
georgia
law,
came
from
an
earlier
tradition
when
a
woman
was
regarded
as
as
good
as
dead
once
she
was
raped;
and
the
crime
was
thought
to
be
an
offense
against
her
husband
or
her
father
as
much
as
it
was
to
her.
and
that
was
the
background
of
coker,
plus
the
racial
element
in
it
was
very
strong.
i
imagine
that
that...
if
the
question
were...
the
coker
question
were
to
come
up
again,
those
would
still
be
factors.
i
mean,
the
notion
was
that
making
rape
equivalent
to
murder
was
no
kindness
to
women,
because
it
said
once
you've
been
raped,
you're
spoiled.
that's
not...
there's
no
parallel
with
child
rape.
so
i
think
that
what
was
going
on
under
the
surface
in
coker
is
quite
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
isn't...
it
isn't
the
notion
that
she's
somebody
else's
property;
and...
which
was
the
history
of
the
rape
statutes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
25
years,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
one
respect
is
broader,
and
perhaps
whether
it
assists
your
position,
coker
is
a
crime
that
could
have
only
a
female
victim
and
a
male
perpetrator,
but
this
child
rape
statute
as
i
understand
it
could
be
the...
the
victim
could,
male
or
female;
the
perpetrator
could
be
male
or
female.
