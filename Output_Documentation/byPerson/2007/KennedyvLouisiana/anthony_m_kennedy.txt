what
about
treason?
even
the
countries
of
europe
which
have
joined
the
european
convention
on
human
rights,
i
believe
they
make
an
exception
to
the
prohibition
of
the
death
penalty
for
treason.
you
can
slaughter
your
fellow
citizens,
but
if
you
offend
the
state
you
can
be
put
to
death.
is
treason
an
exception
from
the...
our
ban
on
the
death
penalty
except
for
murder?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
fisher,
your
white
light
is
on,
and
you
do
want
to
protect
your
rebuttal
right,
but
you
began
by
indicating
that
this
statute
could
be
narrowed.
it
could
be
narrowed
by
a
requirement
of
recidivist
behavior.
are
there
any
other
narrowing
categories?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
they
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
both...
both
sides
have
something
of
a
dilemma
with
coker,
because
if
you
say
that
it
does
not
control
this
case,
then
the
consensus
or
the
lack
of
consensus...
or
the
consensus
is
more
reliable.
if
you
say
it
does
control
this
case,
then
the
consensus
is
not
so
reliable;
and
both
sides
have
that
duality
that
they
have
to
confront.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
was
some
indication
that
in
most
cases
the
prosecutors,
in
part
to
see
if
they
can
get
a
plea
bargain,
begin
by
saying
they're
going
to
charge
with
the
death
penalty.
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
prosecutorial
discretion.
again,
it
cuts
to
weight.
in
one
sense,
it's...
it's
a
check,
so
that
only
the
most
egregious
cases
are
covered.
on
the
other
hand,
there's
a
temptation
to
overreach,
and
it's
an
argument
that
petitioners
make
for
saying
that
the
death
penalty
should
not
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
were
asked
to
draft
this
statute
that
we
have
here
and
you
have
just
the
definition
of
the
first
statute
with
the...
what
we
call
aggravated
kind
of...
and
you
have
the
age
limit,
would
any
other
limiting
categories
occur
to
you
as
being
inconsistent
with
sound
statutory
drafting
and
sound
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
prior
conviction--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
prior
offenses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
in
front
of
us
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
not
a
speech
case
where
you
have
standing
to
object
to
the
statute
that
can...
would
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
others--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
is...
contradicts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
by
a
louisiana
jury
of
raping
his
stepdaughter.
she
was
eight
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
in
addition
to
mental
anguish,
she
sustained
serious
physical
injuries,
injuries
that
required
emergency
surgery.
these
are
described
in
detail
in
the
opinion.
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
death.
he
challenged
his
sentence
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eighteenth
amendment,
that
provision
is
applicable
to
the
states
via
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
petitioner's
death
sentence.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
question,
whether
the
eight
amendment
bars
louisiana
from
imposing
the
death
penalty
for
the
rape
of
a
child
where
the
crime
did
not
result,
and
did
not
--
was
not
intended
to
result
in
the
death
of
the
victim.
the
eight
amendment
requires
a
punishment
for
a
crime
be
graduated
and
proportioned
to
the
offense.
we
determined
whether
this
requirement
has
been
fulfilled
not
by
the
standards
that
prevailed
when
the
eight
amendment
was
adopted
in
1791,
but
by
considering
the
standards
of
decency
that
marked
the
progress
of
our
maturing
society.
the
opinion
discusses
the
precedents
which
control
our
eight
amendment
analysis
in
the
case
and
the
opinion
discusses
a
number
of
supreme
court
precedents.
three
of
the
principal
cases
we
discussed
in
the
opinion
are
these,
two
are
recent
ones,
roper
versus
simmons,
that
case
held
that
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
applied
to
a
person
who
was
under
18
when
the
crime
was
committed.
and
another
is
atkins
versus
virginia
holding
the
penalty
cannot
be
imposed
on
a
mentally
retarded
person.
then
there
is
this
third
case
that
we
will
discuss
briefly
here,
which
is
coker
versus
georgia
an
older
case
dating
from
1977.
in
coker,
the
court
held
that
the
death
penalty
could
not
be
imposed
for
the
rape
of
an
adult,
where
the
crime
did
not
result
and
was
not
intended
to
result
in
the
death
of
the
victim.
the
case
before
us,
of
course,
involves
the
rape
of
a
child.
in
these
and
other
cases
discussed
in
the
opinion,
the
court
was
guided
by
objective
indicia
of
society's
standards,
as
expressed
in
legislative
enactments
and
state
practice
with
respect
to
executions.
we
follow
that
same
approach
here,
based
both
on
consensus
and
our
own
independent
judgment.
our
holding
is
that
this
sentence
does
violate
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments,
the
louisiana
statute
is
unconstitutional.
the
opinion
reviews
the
history
and
present
status
of
state
law
on
the
issue
of
capital
punishment
for
child
rape.
six
states
now
permit
the
death
penalty
for
this
crime.
by
contrast,
45
jurisdiction,
44
states
plus
the
federal
government
prohibit
the
execution
of
child
rapist.
our
opinion
compares
these
statistics
with
the
data.
the
court
relied
upon
in
roper
and
atkins,
and
in
the
felony
murder
case
enmund
versus
florida.
though
our
review
of
national
consensus
is
not
confined
to
tallying
the
number
of
states
with
applicable
death
penalty
legislation,
it
is
of
significance
that
the
number
of
jurisdiction
that
would
prohibit
petitioner's
execution
exceeds
the
number
of
jurisdictions,
we
considered
in
those
earlier
precedents.
the
opinion
also
relies
upon
other
measures
of
consensus
including
statistics
about
the
number
of
executions.
no
individual
has
been
executed
for
the
rape
of
an
adult
or
child
since
1964,
and
no
execution
for
any
other
non-homicide
offense
has
taken
place
since
1963.
louisiana
is
the
only
state
since
the
court's
1972
decision
in
furman
that
has
sentenced
an
individual
to
death
for
the
crime
of
child
rape.
petitioner
is
one
of
only
two
individuals
now
on
death
row
in
the
united
states
for
a
non-homicide
offense.
the
state
of
louisiana
has
argued
that
states
have
felt
constrained
by
this
court's
holding
in
coker.
the
state
says
that
this
is
blocked,
the
development
of
legislative
consensus.
we
see
no
clear
indication
of
this
for
the
reasons
discussed
at
length
in
the
opinion.
furthermore,
consensus
has
never
been
dispositive.
in
the
end,
our
judgment
--
in
our
own
judgment
must
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
question
of
the
acceptability
of
the
death
penalty
under
the
eight
amendment.
it
is
obvious
that
the
rape
in
this
case
caused
the
victim
prolonged
physical
and
mental
suffering.
nonetheless,
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
excessive
or
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
mandates
that
the
state's
power
to
punish
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
evolving
standards
of
decency
in
the
maturing
society.
it’s
an
established
principle
that
decency,
in
its
essence,
presumes
respect
for
the
individual
and
thus
moderation
or
restraint
in
the
application
of
capital
punishment.
difficulties
in
administering
the
penalty
to
ensure
against
its
arbitrary
and
capricious
application
require
a
caution
at
this
stage
of
evolving
standards
and
expanding
the
death
penalty
to
an
area
where
standards
to
confine
its
use
are
indefinite
and
obscure.
we
find
significant
the
number
of
executions
that
would
be
allowed
under
respondent's
approach
approximately
5,702
incidents
of
rape
of
a
child
under
the
age
of
12
were
reported
nationwide
in
the
year
2005.
this
is
almost
twice
the
total
incidence
of
intentional
murder
for
victims
of
all
ages
reported
during
the
same
period.
we
do
sanction
the
death
penalty
for
this
rape
offense,
the
number
of
permissible
executions
could
not
be
reconciled
with
our
evolving
standards
of
decency
and
the
necessity
to
constrain
the
use
of
the
death
penalty.
we
hold
that
as
it
relates
to
violent
offenses
against
individual
persons,
the
death
penalty
is
disproportionate
and
an
excessive
punishment
where
death
did
not
result
from
the
crime.
our
ruling
is
consistent
with
justifications
offered
for
the
death
penalty,
true,
we
cannot
say
that
the
death
penalty
will
serve
no
retributive
or
deterrent
function
in
this
case.
but
a
number
of
factors
demonstrate
the
serious
negative
consequences
of
making
child
rape
a
capital
offense.
seeking
the
death
penalty
for
child
rape
forces
a
moral
choice
on
the
child
victim
who
testifies.
she
is
not
of
mature
age
to
make
that
choice.
in
addition,
the
problem
of
unreliable,
induced,
or
even
imagined
to
child
testimony,
heightens
the
risk
of
wrongful
convictions.
there
also
is
the
problem
of
under
reporting
of
child
rape,
which
diminishes
the
penalty’s
deterrent
effect.
and
by
making
the
punishment
for
child
rape
and
murder
equivalent,
a
state
that
punishes
child
rape
by
death
may
remove
a
strong
incentive
for
the
rapist
not
to
kill
the
victim.
one
last
point
there
as
mentioned,
it’s
been
argued
that
our
determination
that
the
death
penalty
for
child
rape
is
unconstitutional,
will
block
further
consensus
in
favor
of
the
penalty
from
developing.
this
concern
overlooks
the
meaning
and
full
substance
of
the
established
proposition
that
the
eight
amendment
is
defined
by
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
mark
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society,
and
that
principle
requires
that
use
of
the
death
penalty
be
limited
and
restrained,
and
reserved
for
the
worst
offenders
and
offenses.
in
most
cases,
justice
is
not
better
served
by
terminating
the
life
of
the
perpetrator
rather
than
confining
him
and
preserving
the
possibility
of
rehabilitation.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined.
