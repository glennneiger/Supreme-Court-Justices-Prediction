justice
antonin
scalia
our
jurisprudence
just
requires
the
narrowing
of
the
death
penalty
to
be...
to
particularly
heinous
crimes.
and
one
could
say
that
rape
is
in
and
of
itself
particularly
heinous,
rape
of
a
child
of
12
or
under.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
you
describe
a
particularly
heinous
rape
of
a
child
under
12?
what
would
make
it
particularly
heinous?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
suppose
the
state
says
that
all
recidivist
rapists
of
children
under
12
will
suffer
the
death
penalty.
does
it
have
to
narrow
that
class
further?
i
mean,
the
need
for
narrowing
depends
upon
how
narrow
the
class
is
described
in
the
first
place.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
the
law
says
you
have
to
be
a
recidivist,
you
have
to
have
all
the
other
factors
that
you
just
mentioned,
if
the
law
said
that,
would
you
come
in
and
say,
"oh,
no,
you
can't
just
give
everybody
who
commits
that
crime
the
death
penalty?
"
you
have
to
narrow
the
class.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
strange
way
of
making
a
majority,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
two
people
who
think
even
the
death
penalty
for
murder
is
no
good,
they're
going
to
form
the
majority
of
people
who
consider
whether
a
lawful
death
penalty
can
be
imposed
for
rape.
i
think
at
least
in
those
circumstances,
you
have
to
discount
the
people
who
would
not
allow
the
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances
for
any
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he...
he
is
not
considering
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether...
whether
a
permissible
death
penalty
can
be
imposed
for
this
crime.
these
parties
say
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
permissible
death
penalty.
i
mean,
it
would
be...
if
that
wrinkle
isn't
there,
we
should
iron
it
in
pretty
quickly.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
nice.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
say
that's
nice.
we're
in
effect...
in
effect
prohibiting
the
people
from
changing
their
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
--about
what
justify's
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
we
say
in
atkins
that
it's
the
trend
that
counts;
it's
not
the
number?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trend...
the
trendy
expression
hoist
by
your
own
petard:
the
trend
here
is
clearly
in
the
direction
of
permitting
more
and
more...
of
more
and
more
states
permitting
the
capital
punishment
for
this
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
even
have
to
say
"the
extent
allowed
by
the
united
states
supreme
court.
"
they
can
pass
a
law
that
seems
to
contradict
a
prior
opinion
of
ours;
can't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
abraham
lincoln
should
they
could,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
really
think
that
if
this
court
held
in
the
present
case
that
the
death
penalty
can
be
imposed
for
the
rape
of
a
child
under
12,
do
you
really
think
that
the
trend
would
not
continue,
that
there
would
not
be
more
states
to
enact
such
a
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
there
would
be
more?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it
would
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
a
federal
treason
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
doesn't
require
murder;
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
treason
is
worse
than
child
rape?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
do
you
do
view
recidivism?
i
mean,
i
assume
even
if
you
don't
oppose
the
death
penalty,
you're
going
to
get
a
good
number
of
years,
right?
so
you
are
going
to
be
40
years
in
prison,
come
out
and
do
it
again?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
is
an
unrealistic
condition
that
you
have
raped
a
12-year...
a
child
twice.
the
first
time
you
do
it
and
are
convicted
of
it,
you'll
be
sent
up
for
long
enough
that
you
won't
have
the
chance
to
do
it
a
second
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
the
way
they
used
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
clark,
what
do
you
do
with
the
requirement
that
our
cases
have
imposed?
it
is
not
a
requirement
i
agree
with,
but
it
is
certainly
one
our
cases
have
imposed,
that
you
cannot
leave...
leave
it
to
the
jury
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty
or
not
even
for
murder,
but
rather
you
have
to
narrow
the
class
of
people
who
have
committed
that
particular
crime
so
that...
so
that
the
imposition
won't
be
random.
although
later,
we
say
you
have
to
let
the
jury
consider
any
mitigating
factory
which
makes
it
random;
but
nonetheless,
our
cases
do
say
you
have
to
narrow
the
class
of
murderers
who
can
be
given
the
death
penalty.
wouldn't
the
same
apply
to
the
class
of
child
rapists?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
intentional
murder
of
a...
of
a
law
officer
would
need
no
further
narrowing?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you?
do
you
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
the...
didn't
the
louisiana
statute
that...
that
was
at
issue
in
lowenfield
produce
the
result
that
if
you
committed
intentional
murder
of
a
law
enforcement
officer,
it
was
up
to
the
jury
whether
to
give
you
the
death
penalty
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
not
the
same
result
be...
be
achieved
by
a
statute
that
said
if
you
intentionally
kill
a
law
enforcement
officer,
you
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty?
wouldn't
it
be
precisely
the
same
degree
of
narrowing?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
all
child
rape.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
all
child
rape.
it
was
only
children
up
to
the
age
of
11.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
the
difference.
if
you
have
a
general
murder
law
with
an
aggravating
factor
of
killing
of
a
law
officer,
okay,
the
jury
can
decide
from
the
whole
category
of
killings
of
law
officers
who
gets
the
death
penalty
and
who
doesn't.
why
is
that
any
different
from
what
happens
when
you
have
a
statute
that
makes
it
a
capital
offense
to
kill
a
law
officer,
without
any
further
qualification?
it's
exactly
the
same
result.
it
goes
to
the
jury.
this
person
killed
a
law
officer.
it
is
up
to
you
whether
you
give
him
the
death
penalty
or
not.
