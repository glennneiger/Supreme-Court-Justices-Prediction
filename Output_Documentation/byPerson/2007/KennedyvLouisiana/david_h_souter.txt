justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
if,
instead,
the
state
simply
defined
the
class
as
the
class
of
those
who
commit
rape,
and
then
listed
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
the
rape
of
a
child
under
12
years
old?
that
would
be
perfectly
consistent
with
the
narrowing
jurisprudence,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
even...
even
with
respect
to...
now,
i'm
asking
you
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
forget
my
question
again
for
a
minute.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
on
the
plurality
analysis,
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it
is,
if
there
is
any
question
left
in
coker,
in
effect
it's
answered
by
enmund/tison.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
then
that's
a
different
reason.
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
your...
to
your
answer
on
the
murder
question?
and
that
was
you
said
there's...
there's
a
murder
analog
to
this
narrow
definition,
and
you
gave
the
example
of
the
murder
of
the
law
enforcement
officer.
and
that
raises
a
question
that
i
had
about
how
lowenfield
ought
to
be
read.
the
example
that
you
gave
was
one
of
the
five
instances
which
the
court
said
out
in
the
lowenfield
opinion
quoting
the
louisiana
statute.
in
each
of
those
five
instances,
nothing
need
be
proved
except,
as
you
have
put
it,
the
narrowing
circumstance
in
the
law
enforcement
officer
in
your
example.
but
under
the
louisiana
statute
which
passed
muster
in
lowenfield,
there
were
five
analogs
of
which
the
law
enforcement
officer
was
one.
each
of
those
crimes
was
defined
as
a
killing
with
a
specific
intent
to
kill
or
specific
intent
to
inflict
great
bodily
harm.
and
then
in
each
one
of
these
instances,
there
was
an
extra
element
added:
law
enforcement
officer,
intent
to
kill
more
than
three
people
in
lowenfield,
and
so
on.
in
fact,
child
under
12
was
one
of
the
examples.
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
one
way
to
read
the
louisiana
statute
there
consistently
with
the...
with
the
value
that
justice
scalia's
question
raised
is
this:
that
louisiana,
in
effect,
had
created
a
general
crime
of
murder
with
specific
intent
to
kill
or
inflict
great
bodily
harm.
and
then
it
had
given
five
instances
in
which,
as
i
put
it
a
moment
ago,
there
was
an
extra
element:
and
that
extra
element,
whether
it
be
killing
more
than
two
people,
whether
it
be
killing
a
child
under
12,
law
enforcement
officer,
functioned
like
the
aggravating
circumstance;
so
that,
in
fact,
we
didn't
have
a
statute
that
merely
said
if
you
kill
a
law
officer
intentionally,
that's
capital,
period.
what
we
had
was
a
capital
scheme
that
says
if
you
kill
with
specific
intent
to
kill
or
inflict
great
bodily
harm,
that's
murder.
and
if
you
commit
one
of
these
other
five
other
elements,
that
narrows
it
down
to
capital
murder.
isn't
that
a
proper
way
of
reading
the
louisiana
murder
statute
from
which
you
took
your
example?
and
if
it
is,
isn't
that
example
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
you're
arguing
here
that
you
can
simply
define
child
rape
as
capital
and
let
it
go
at
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
quite
agree
with
that.
my
point
was
just
this:
you
made
the
argument...
as
i
understood
it
a
moment
ago...
that
the
louisiana
child
rape
statute
is
not
unique;
that,
in
fact,
louisiana
defines
other
crimes
very
narrowly,
so
that
you
were
making
a
different
kind
of
argument.
you
were
saying
we
in
louisiana
define
murder
of
a
law
enforcement
officer
very
narrowly.
no
requirement
to
add
any
narrowing
or
aggravating
circumstance
there,
and
the
statute
passed
muster.
and
my
point
simply
is,
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
to
read
the
louisiana
statute.
the
louisiana
statute
instead
says
killing
with
intent
et
cetera
is...
is
capital
murder
if
there
is
a
further
circumstance
added
to
it;
and
five
are
given.
so
all
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
your
capital
murder
passed
muster
under
lowenfield
is
authority
for
saying
that
the
child
rape
statute
passes
muster
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
find
out
how
much.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't...
isn't
the
difference...
isn't
the
difference
just
what
justice
scalia
brought
up
in
an
earlier
question
to
mr.
fisher?
he
said
what
seems
to
count,
the
way
we
have
targeted
our
jurisprudence,
turns
on
how
you
define
the
class
that
is
narrowed.
and
my
suggestion
to
you
was
that
the
class
that
is
narrowed
under
your
homicide
statute
is
a
class
that
consist
of
all
killing
with
specific
intent
to
kill
et
cetera,
which
is
then
narrowed
by
five
different
circumstances
set
out.
here,
the
class
is
defined
as
child
murder,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
aggravating
circumstances,
the
possible
aggravating
circumstances
that
narrows
it
any
more;
and
isn't
that
distinction
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
about
the
effect
of
enmund
and
tison
as
a...
as
a
means
to
understand
how
we
ought
to
read
coker?
you
know
what
i'm
getting
at.
