mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
country
has
not
executed
anyone
for
a
rape
of
any
kind
in
over
43
years.
louisiana's
attempt
to
reintroduce
this
practice
into
american
society
violates
the
eighth
amendment
for
two
distinct
reasons.
first,
a
long-standing
national
consensus
exists
against
it.
indeed,
louisiana's
capital
rape
law
is
particularly
at
odds
with
national
values
because
louisiana
is
the
only
state
in
which
petitioner,
as
a
non-recidivist,
could
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
second,
louisiana's
law
violates
this
court's
eighth
amendment-narrowing
jurisprudence.
it
gives
juries
unfettered
discretion
to
choose
who,
among
the
vast
class
of
offenders
convicted
of
child
rape,
may
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
now,
this
is
in
stark
contrast
to
the
handful
of
other
states
that
have
capital
rape
laws
that
they've
recently
enacted.
texas,
for
example,
requires
an
offender
to
have
served
a
prior
sentence
for
the
same
crime
of
25
years
before--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it's
no
doubt
a
serious
crime,
justice
scalia,
but
i
believe
this
court's
narrowing
jurisprudence
requires
narrowing
beyond
a
particularly
heinous
crime.
of
course,
in
godfrey
and
gregg
against
georgia,
this
court
said
that
deliberate
murder
is
not
on
its
own
enough
to
subject
an
offender
to
the
death
penalty.
so
there's
two
problems
that
arise
with
louisiana's
statute
in
the
context
of
this
court's
narrowing
jurisprudence.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
there
could
be
several
aggravating
facts
that
would
make
a
rape
of
a
child,
or
indeed
of
any
person,
a
particularly
egregious
crime,
but
in
coker
against
georgia,
this
court
did
not
simply
hold
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibited
imposing
the
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape;
it
held
that
this
court...
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibited
imposing
the
death
penalty
for
rape
with
aggravating
circumstances.
remember
in
coker
against
georgia,
there
were
two
aggravating
circumstances
in
that
case.
first,
the
offender
was
a
recidivist.
he
had
been
convicted
of
rape
three
times,
was
a
convicted
murder
who
had
escaped
from
prison.
second,
he
committed
the
rape
in
the
course
of
committing
other
very
serious
felonies,
including
kidnapping
and
robbery.
and
so,
at
the
very
minimum,
the
state
stands
here
with
the
burden
today
to
say
that
an
average
child
rape
is
worse
than
the
crime
in
coker,
that
this
court
held
was
not
sufficiently
superior--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
no
question
that
would
be
a
much
stronger
argument
under
this
court's
narrowing
jurisprudence.
now,
you'd
still
be
left
with
two
problems
with
that
kind
of
a
statute:
first,
you'd
still
potentially
be
left
with
the
problem
that
this
court
addressed
in
furman
and
all
the
subsequent
cases
of
having
a
large
class
of
offenders
of
which
only
a
few
get
the
death
penalty.
now,
there
needs
to
be
some
reason
to
differentiate.
the
state
might
well
say...
especially
the
state
of
texas
and
other
states
that
have
these
very
severe
recidivist
requirements
might
say
that
is
good
enough,
but
they'd
still
be
left
with
the...
with
the
argument
that
they
would
have
to
make
that
a
person
who
convicts...
who
commits
child
rape
and
does
not...
it
does
not
result
any
death,
is
a
worse
offender
than
somebody
who
deliberately
kills
somebody--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--on
average.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'm
not
sure
it
would,
justice
souter.
remember
coker
tells
us,
i
think,
that
you
can't
simply
start
with
rape
and
then
add
an
aggravating
circumstance,
in
terms
of
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence.
but
even
if
you're
asking,
just
in
terms--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--let
me
first
say
that
the
state
hasn't
alleged
those
things
that
justice
powell
identified.
so,
even
if
justice
powell's
opinion
controlled,
i
think
we
would
prevail
here.
but
remember--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
my
understanding
of
this
court's
marks
rule
is
that
the
narrowest
opinion
that
commands
a
majority...
so
justice
powell's
opinion
was
actually
a
seventh
vote.
if
you
count
the
two
justices
on
this
court
who
held
the
death
penalty
was
unconstitutional
across
the
board
and
add
the
four
that
constituted
the
plurality
in
coker,
we
think
the
plurality
opinion
becomes--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
controlling
one.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
wrinkle
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
says
that
if
a
justice
is
too
far
out
of
the
mainstream
that
their
vote
is
discounted.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but
i
want
to
try
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--fair
enough.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
okay.
thank
you.
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
okay.
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
right,
and
it's
also
answered
by
simply
the
empirics
across
the
country
right
now,
if
you
did
nothing
more
than
applied
the
roper
and
atkins
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
it's
possible,
but
this
court
has
understood...
i
think
well
understood
that
it
is
a
practical
problem.
it
is
one
that
gives
this
court
caution
before
ruling
a
law
unconstitutional.
here,
i
don't
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--you're
going
to
need
to
gravel--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
the
case,
justice
scalia.
and,
of
course,
there
are
narrower
ways
to
decide
this
case
that
could
leave
open
the
possibility
of
future
developments.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
answer
your
question
and
say
i
think
there
may
be
a
misunderstanding
that
this
court
really
needs
to
address
that
in
this
case,
because
we
have
had,
since
1995
when
the
state
of
louisiana
passed
this
law
and
the
year
after
when
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
upheld
it
in
a
very
widely
covered
opinion
from
which
this
court
denied
certiorari,
there
has
been
a
national
debate
for
12
or
13
years
already
as
to
the
propriety
of
imposing
the
death--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
right.
you
have
to
ask
yourself
the
question
whether
that
is
enough.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
this
court
said
in
atkins--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--clearly,
i
think
that
atkins
and
roper
look
at
trend
among
other
things.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
remember
that
there
were
20
states
in
each
of
those
cases
that
allowed
the
death
penalty
under
those
circumstances,
but
i
think
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
whether
the
movement
that's
occurred
over
the
past
dozen
years
is
enough
to
matter.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
as
it
happened
here,
states
can
pass
laws,
and
they
can
bring
prosecutions
potentially
reaching--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
a
state
could
do
something
like
what
georgia
has
done,
which
is
pass
a
law
that
says
that
the
death
penalty
is
permissible
in
a
given
crime...
in,
for
example,
rape...
to
the
extent
allowed
by
the
united
states
supreme
court,
which
is
the
extent
allowed
by
the
eighth
amendment.
if
several
states
pass
laws
like
that,
eventually
this
court
even...
let's
say
the
court
decides
this
case
in
my
favor
today.
eventually
this
court
could
take
notice
of
that
and
take
certiorari
and
again
decide
whether
or
not
the
eighth
amendment
was--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--of
course.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
there's
no
double
about
that,
and
it
happens
frequently.
now
i
want
to
ask
about--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--as
i
said,
it
may
be
practically
difficult,
but
it's
not
impossible,
because
this
court
could
eventually
take
notice
of
what
it
was
seeing.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
ask--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
first,
it
is
a
theoretical
argument
that
doesn't
have
any
factual
underpinning.
there
is
no
evidence
in
any
state
legislature
that
coker
has
stood
in
the
way
of
enacting
statutes
like
this.
and,
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
to
this
court
to
remember,
if
there
were
any
overhang
or
distorting
effect
of
coker,
it
certainly
would
have
gone
away
by
1996
when
the
louisiana
supreme
court
laid
out
a
very
detailed
opinion
explaining
why
a
law
like
this
could
be
constitutional
and,
in
effect,
exhorting
other
states
to
pass
laws
like
it.
and
so
for
a
dozen
years
in
death-penalty
jurisdictions
there
has
been
a
very
vigorous
effort
by
proponents
of
these
laws
to
get
statutes
like
this
passed.
and
look
what
we
end
up
with.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
bring
myself
back
to
your
trend
question.
what
we
end
up
with
is
exactly
the
same
number
of
states
allowing
the
death
penalty
here
as
allowed
it
in
coker
in
1977.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
there
are,
no
doubt,
various
legislative
considerations.
i
just
would--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--oh,
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
absolutely,
i
think
that
it
would
not
continue.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if...
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
not
just
the
louisiana
supreme
court;
but
in
2004,
when
patrick
kennedy
was
put
on
death
row
in
louisiana,
in
light
of
this
court's
atkins
and
roper
jurisprudence,
notice
was
served
in
all
death-penalty
jurisdictions
that
if
you
want
a
law
like
this,
you've
got
a
few
years
to
pass
it
before
this
case
gets
to
the
supreme
court.
i
think
that's
why
you
have
seen
an
uptick
of
two
or
there
other
states
passing
laws
in
the
last
couple
of
years.
but,
again,
all
that
has
done
is
recreate
the
situation
this
court
faced
in
1977
in
coker,
where
six
states
would
have
allowed
the
death
penalty
for
child
rape.
and
in
roper
this
court
emphasized
that
it
would
be
very
ironic
to
find
a
trend
or
a
lack
of
movement
dispositive
if
the
reason
for
that
action
more
recently
is
because
long
ago
society
recognized
that
this
was
an
improper
punishment
and
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
they
may
well,
justice
alito.
it's
important
to
recognize
not
just...
well,
in
roper
this
court
said...
i
think
it
addressed
a
similar
question.
there
has
to
be
a
line
somewhere
in
terms
of
the
eighth
amendment.
now,
we
can
imagine
a
terribly
serious
case
with
a
juvenile
offender
who
is
17
years
old,
for
example,
but
drawing
a
line
in
a
place
that
makes
sense
almost
all
of
the
time
is
the
best
we
can
do.
if
a
state
were
to
come
up
and
make
the
argument
today
that:
imagine
the
most
heinous
child
rape
you
can,
first
of
all,
it
wouldn't
say
that
under
the
narrowing
problem
because
of
maynard
against
cartwright.
but,
more
importantly,
other
states
would
beg
to
differ.
look
at
utah.
utah
thinks
the
next
most
serious
crime
after
murder
is
assault,
an
aggravated
assault
on
a
prison
guard.
south
dakota
thinks
the
next
most
serious
crime
after
murder
is
aggravated
kidnapping.
once
you
roll
the
line
back
from
the
line
established
in
coker,
which
is
requiring
the
death
of
the
victim,
it
becomes
extraordinarily
difficult
to
figure
out
where
the
line
is
going
to
be
drawn
for
eighth
amendment
purposes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
this
court
has
always
differentiated
its
proportionality
analysis
from
capital
to
a
non-capital
context.
in
coker,
enmund,
tison,
all
of
those
cases,
rest
to
a
significant
degree
on
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
i
think
perhaps
the
best
discussion
is
made--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
of
course,
this
court
has
never
answered
that,
but
i
think
there
is
every
reason
to
believe--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--of
course.
there
is
every
reason
to
believe--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
it
does
not.
it
requires
a--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
your
honor.
and
i
think
if
anyone
thought
that
the
treason
laws
were
implicated
here,
you
might
have
different
parties
before
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
blackstone
thought
treason
was
more
serious
than
murder.
it
has
traditionally
been
the
most
serious
crime
that
a
person
can
commit,
and
i
think
historically,
as
well
at
nationally,
that
is
still
the
sentiment
that
is
shared.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
now--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
don't
think
societal
attitudes
have
changed
very
much.
but
to
the
extent
any
of
it
has,
what
this
court
said
in
atkins
is
you
look
to
the
expertise
of
professional
organizations;
and
i
think
it
is
relevant
here
that
if
the
state
stands
up
and
says
well,
the
reason
why
we
are
doing
this
is
because
of
more
enlightened
attitudes
about
the
harm
that
occurs
in
child
rape,
all
of
the
professional
organizations
sex
assault
groups,
social
workers,
and
the
like
that
deal
with
that
crime,
like
here
in
the
amicus--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--perhaps
not.
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
this
court
chooses
its
words...
other
parts
of
the
coker
decision
i
think
make
clear
that
the
court
understood
that
rape
was
an
extraordinarily
serious
crime.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
ginsburg,
i
think,
although
not
with
the
same
historical
pedigree,
the
same
argument
is
being
put
forward
by
the
state
today,
that
by
definition,
for
a
child
to
have
been
raped
is
tantamount
to
having
been
killed,
and
the
social
workers
and
sex
assault
experts
here
today
i
think
are
telling
you
with
this
one
voice,
we
very
much
want
to
avoid
sending--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
fair
enough,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
think
also
i'd
like...
perhaps
justice
alito
was
right,
that
looking
at
the
court's
opinion
gives
us
the
best
indication
of
the
analysis;
and
i
think
the
parts
that
you
were
reading
are
from
the
earlier
part
of
the
opinion
where
the
court
was
saying
that
rape
in
general
is
not
as
serious
as
murder,
but
the
end
of
the
plurality
win
in
coker
is
very
emphatic.
it
says,
that
doesn't
end
the
question,
because
we
have
two
very
serious
aggravating
circumstances
and
this
is
a
particularly
serious
incident
of
rape.
even
then,
the
court's
words
were,
that
does
not
change
the
fact
that
the
victim
is
not
killed.
so
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--we
don't
argue
otherwise.
we
understand
coker
says
adult
woman.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
rationale
of
coker,
and
not
just
the
rationale
requiring
somebody
to
have
died,
but
also
the
objective
rationale
in
coker,
of
saying
we
understand
in
the
past
four,
five
years,
there's
been
a
handful;
of
states
that
have
come
forward
with
laws
like
this
but
we
nonetheless
find
a
national
consensus
against
it.
look
at
the
numbers
in
coker.
you
had
30
people
on
death
row
over
the
span
of
five
or
six
years
for
rape,
as
compared
to
this
case,
you
have
two
people
on
death
row
over
a
span
of
13
years.
even
the
practices
on
the
ground
indicate
quite
strongly
that
society
and
even
louisiana...
look
at
louisiana
where
in
direct
contrast
to
the
way
they
prosecute
murder
cases,
in
which
it
is
common
for
the
prosecution
to
take
the
position
that
the
death
penalty
is
the
only
appropriate
punishment
for
this
crime,
they
offer
life
imprisonment.
they've
offered
life
in
prison
in
every
single
child
rape
case
they've
prosecuted
in
the
in
the
last
13
years.
the
only
reason
you
have
patrick
kennedy
here
today
and
one
other
offender
on
death
row
is
because
they
insisted
on
their
innocence.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
there
are
two
ways
to
decide
this
case
on
more
narrow
grounds,
i'll
offer
this
answer
to
your
question.
first,
this
court
could
say
that
louisiana
is
the
only
state
that
doesn't
require
recidivism,
so
it
fails
the
substantive
tison
roper
analysis.
it
could
also
say
that...
that
louisiana's
law
isn't
sufficiently
narrow.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
if
the
question
is
could
there
be
another
particularly
heinous
circumstance
that
you,
just
in
the
context
of
narrowing
would
be
enough,
one
might
imagine
other
aggravating
circumstances.
coker
wouldn't
be--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--one
could
imagine
something
like
torture
or
extraordinarily
serious
harm
in
a
case,
something
like
that.
but
again,
that
would--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
not
sure
what
the
question
is.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
perhaps
the
states
want
to
speak
to
that.
they're
the
ones
that
put
it
in
their
law.
but
it
reinforces--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes,
in
texas
and
a
couple
of
other
states.
i
think
it
reinforces
the
fact
that
they
think
that
by
and
large
child
rape
is
not
serious
enough
even
in
those
states
to
trigger
the
death
penalty,
and
so
they're
looking
for
an
extraordinarily
small
class.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
would
like
to
address
first
the
narrowing
component
of
this
case
and
then
turn
to
the
idea
of
trends
on
the
first
question
presented.
first,
the
reasons
for
this
court's
narrowing
jurisprudence
is
to
avoid
a
situation
in
which
a
few,
only
a
few
offenders
out
of
a
vast
pool
are
given
the
death
penalty,
and
there's
no
legal
principled
explanation
to
describe
why
those
offenders
get
the
death
penalty.
ms.
clark
says
that
louisiana's
law
is
narrow.
well,
if
you
just
look
at
empiric,
as
best
as
we've
been
able
to
gather
statistics
and
texas
has
some
similar
statistics
in
its
brief,
we're
talking
about
under
louisiana's
definition
of
child
rape
about
five
times
as
many
individuals
per
year
as
are
convicted
of
deliberate
murder.
this
is
enormous
class.
and
what
you
end
up
with
is
only
one
every
several
years
getting
the
death
penalty.
that
is
the
definition
of
arbitrary
and
capriciousness.
justice
breyer,
mr.
cruz
is
right,
louisiana
supreme
court
at
58(a)
addressed...
addressed...
as
existed
at
trial,
it
included
oral
rape.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
under
ex
post
facto
which
is
the
operative
one
or
not,
but
it
doesn't
matter
because
even
the
anal
or
vaginal
component
statute
still
gets
you
five
times
as
many...
than
just
absolutely
being
struck
by
lightning.
even
in
louisiana
simply
consensual
sex
between
an
18-year-old
and
a
12-year-old
is
a
capital
offense.
and
so
we
don't
think
louisiana's
law
sufficiently
narrows.
mr.
cruz
says--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
is
with
respect
to
narrowing,
because
mr.
cruz...
the
only
answer
to
that,
i
think
is
what
mr.
cruz--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--we
absolutely
do--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--there's
square
precedent,
unanimous
holding
of
this
court
in
maynard
against
cartwright
so
that
you
can't
justify
a
statute
that
fails
to
narrow
on
as
applied
grounds.
the
constitutional
infirmity
is
the
fact
that
it
gives
unfettered
discretion
to
prosecutors
and
juries
to
choose
who
to
give
the
death
sentence
to.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
jury
has
discretion.
but
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
you
have
a
much
smaller
pool
of
offenders
and
a
much
higher
likelihood
the
jury
is
going
to
return
death.
here
you
have
have
a
vast
pool
and
literally
persons
one
out
of
every
several
years
getting
the
death
penalty.
if
i
could
say
a
thing...
two
things
about
the
trend
argument
that
the
states
have
putting
forward?
first,
remember
there's
no
trend
whatsoever
with
respect
to
non-recidivists.
the
other
states
that
have
passed
laws
in
child
rape
context
for
capital...
making
it
a
capital
crime
and
even
in
the
meagan
law
and
others
is
all
about
recidivism.
louisiana
is
not
part
of
that
trend.
louisiana
stands
alone.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
it
would
give
you
a
narrower
way
to
do
this
case.
you
could
say
that
under
the
analysis...
roper
actions
louisiana
stands
alone
in
terms
of
what
is
national
consensus.
in
enmund
this
court
said
that
it
is
not
enough
for
other
states
to
make
the
basic
crime
a
capital
offense.
we
look
to
see
whether
if
the
other
states
require
an
aggravating
circumstance,
that
the
state
before
the
court
does
not;
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
makes
the
offender
more
culpable
or
the
crime
more
serious.
we
exclude
those
states
from
our
bean
counting
analysis.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
we're
looking
at
trends,
perhaps
i
can
leave
you
with
this:
again,
remember
what
we
have
in
terms
of
a
trend.
all
we
have
done
in
the
past
30
years
is
returned
to
the
place
that
we
were
years
ago
in
coker.
in
coker
when
you
read
that
opinion,
six
states
make
child
rape
a
capital
offense.
through
all
the
might
and
effort
of
proponents
of
these
laws,
what
they've
been
able
to
accomplish
over
31
years
is
to
bring
it
back
exactly
where
we
were
in
coker
this.
this
court's
whole
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
is
based
on
the
idea
that
a
few
states
may
well
have
laws
making
something
a
capital
crime
and
may
choose
to
be
outliers,
but
the
very
notion
of
this
court's
proportionality
jurisprudence
is
that
when
states
are
outliers,
and
especially
in
a
case
like
this,
when
even
are
those
outlier
states
impose
the
death
penalty
so
rarely
and
freakishly,
that
is
a
situation
where
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
tolerate
it.
