and
it
would
also,
i
take
it,
be
circumventing
what
could
happen
in
the
district
court.
you
have
to
move
very...
seven
days
in
the
district
court
for
mathematical
error,
and
that's
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
than
for
assistance--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--perhaps
that's
after
a
new
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
if
it's...
what
happens
if
the
sentence
is
five
years,
reversed
on
appeal,
error
in
evidence,
same...
same
offense,
same
indictment?
then
you
have
to
comply
with
the
vindictiveness
rules
before
he
can
give
a
higher
sentence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
think
is
the
rule
if
there's
a
new
trial
and
the
judge
says,
you
know,
what
about
this,
i
heard
the
evidence
again;
i
think
i'm
going
to
increase
the
sentence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what's
sua
sponte--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
a
resentence.
there's
a
new
judgment,
a
new
conviction.
what
happens
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
actually
rule
35
was
changed
because
it
used
to
be
based
on
the
mandate.
but
now
rule
35
says
you
can
reopen
within
seven
days
after
the
verdict
or
finding
of
guilty.
so
that
would
indicate
under
the
rules
that
the
mandate
is
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
within
the
scope
of
the
appeal,
which
brings
us
right
back
to
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
about
your
initial
premise.
i...
i
take
it
the
policy
here
is
that
the
defendant
who
appeals
ought
to
know
what's
at
stake
in
the
appeal.
he
shouldn't
be
surprised.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
he
cross-appeals,
fine;
if
he
doesn't
cross-appeal,
he
knows
what
the
stakes
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
now
you're
saying
that
if
the
sentence
is...
is
vacated,
they
can
start
all
over?
that
the
district
court
can't
start
all
over
if
it's
still
in
the
district
court.
why
should
the
court
of
appeals
have
any
more
authority
than
the
district
court
does?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
this
were
to
be
a
more
frequent
occurrence,
i.e.,
plain
errors,
then
we
were
to
rule
for
you
and
court
of
appeals
generally
would
do
this,
then
a
defendant
might
think
twice
about
appealing
in
a
complex
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
there's
nothing
that
could
happen...
once
the
district
court
rules
and
the
seven
days
for
error
goes
by,
there's
nothing
that
anybody
can
do
to
raise
it.
