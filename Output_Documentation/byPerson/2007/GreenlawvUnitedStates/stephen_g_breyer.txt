justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
if
it's
just
the
converse
case?
the
same
thing,
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
a
government
appeal.
the
sentence
was
10
years.
the
government
thinks
it
should
be
20.
on
appeal,
the
appellate
court
thinks
the
government
is
wrong,
and
moreover,
the
appellate
court
discovers
an
error:
it
should
have
been
one
year.
and
you're
saying,
well,
according
to
you,
not
only
is
the
court
of
appeals
helpless,
but
the
district
court
is
helpless.
so
this
person
is
in
jail
for
nine
years
where
he
shouldn't
have
been.
that's
your
position
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
a
pretty
tough
position.
it...
it
seems
to
me
there
could
be
errors...
and
i
guess
if
he's
sentenced
to
death,
it's
the
same.
i
mean,
the...
the...
it's
a
pretty
tough
position,
isn't
it?
that
there
is
no
authority
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
or
in
the
district
court,
or
anywhere
in
the
system
to
create...
to
correct
a
serious
error
where
a
person
could,
in
fact,
be
in
prison
for
a
long
time
contrary
to
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
it
supposed
to
work
in
your
system
that
we
get
those
errors
corrected?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
(2)(a)
and
(b)
i
thought...
do
i
not
have
this
right,
(2)(a)
and
(b)
say
the
same
thing
as
(1)?
it
says
if
the
sentence
is
too
high
says
the
defendant's
appeal,
then
what
you
do
is
you
vacate
it
and
send
it
back
with
such
instructions
as
the
court
considers
appropriate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
subject
to
(g),
which
has
to
do
with
the
district
court.
then
the
other
part
says
if
it
is
too
low
and
it
was
the
government
that
appealed,
the
court
shall
set
it
aside
and
send
it
back
with
such
instructions
as
it
considers
appropriate,
again
subject
to
(g).
so
all
three
say
the
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
do
you.
if
it's
too
high...
wait.
wait.
if
it
is
too...
ah.
[laughter]
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
way
to
do
this
then
is...
is...
i
see...
this
section
foresees
basically
what
the
other
side
is
saying.
it
foresees
it,
because
it's
a
very
unusual
case
what
happened
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
way
you
should
handle
it,
given
this
section,
is
the
court
of
appeals
would
send...
i'm
trying
this
on...
the
court
of
appeals
says,
well,
it's
the
defendant
that
appealed,
who
appealed.
he
says
the
sentence
is
too
high.
given
what
we
have
in
front
us
in
the
issues,
he's
right;
now
we've
noticed
that
there's
is
other
problems
here.
so
what
we
do
is
send
it
back
for
resentencing.
and,
judge,
when
you
resentence,
look
at
it.
and
see
if
maybe
we're
right.
that
would
be
a
perfectly
fair
way
to
handle
it,
and
a
normal
way
to
handle
it.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
don't
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
could
do
you
this?
because
this
is
quite
helpful
to
me.
reading,
i
started
out
where
justice
scalia
was
at
the
beginning
of
this
argument.
i
thought
the
district
court
normally
has
it
open,
to
the
judge,
to
resentence.
resentence
is
resentence.
you
can't
be
vindictive,
but
that's
the
limit.
that's
how
it
works
normally,
i
thought.
and
given...
if
that's
so,
then
you
look
at
the
three
sections
we
just
saw,
try
to
read
them
together,
and
say
they
certainly
are
written
with
the
notion
that
the
noticing
of
a
plain
error
on
the
other
side
is
going
to
be
few
and
far
between
if
ever.
so
the
normal
way
to
handle
it
is
just
what
we
said:
the
judge
decides
on
the
record
and
the
appeal...
i
decide
this
for
the
defendant
here.
but
i've
noticed
something,
says
the
writing
judge.
and
of
course
it's
open
on
resentencing
to
go
into
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you
were
going
to
do
something
other
than
that,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
you'd
have
to
have
a
reason,
and
it
would
have
to
be
a
fairly
good
reason.
so
you
don't
close
off
the
escape
hatch
because
we
can't
all
foresee
the
future
perfectly,
but
you
say
it's
going
to
be
few
and
far
between.
now
does
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
