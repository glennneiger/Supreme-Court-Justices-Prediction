justice
antonin
scalia
i
could
have
sworn
that
i've
seen
more
than
one
petition
for
certiorari
in
which
the
claim
is
that
the
sentence
was
increased
on
remand
vindictively.
i'm
sure
i've
seen
cert
petitions
like
that.
and
you're
telling
me
that
the
assertion
of
vindictiveness
is
unnecessary,
and
it
just
can't
be
increased
on
remand?
but
all
you
have
is
a
court
of
appeals
case
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
asked
this
question?
we're
going
to
get
a
totally
different
case
here.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
sort
of
an
important
part
of
your
case
that
the
cross-appeal
rule
was
an
established
rule.
you
now
knowledge
that
it's
not
an
established
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
jurisdictional
but
well-established.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
it
is
a
well-established
at
least
rule
of
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
to
be
said
against
that?
how
many
courts
of
appeals
do
not
apply
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
didn't
apply
it
under
this
statute.
i
am
saying,
apart
from
this
statute,
what
courts
of
appeals
in
other
cases
deny
the
existence
of
a
cross-appeal
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
maynard--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
many
of
these
horribles
really
exist,
however
we
decide
this
case.
i
don't
know
that
anybody
says
that
if
there
is
not
a
firm
rule
requiring
the...
a
cross-appeal,
i
don't
know
that
anybody
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
search
the
record
and
correct
any
errors
below.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
talks
about
the
general--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
general
cross-appeal
rule--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
happens
all
the
time,
that
there's
an
error
in
the
judgment
which
the
court
of
appeals
does
not...
does
not
reach
because
there's
no
court...
no
cross-appeal.
it's
totally
unexceptionable.
justice
antonin
scalia
me,
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
could
we
discuss...
let's
leave
aside
for
the
moment
what
the
background
rule
of
law
is
and
discuss
whether...
i
guess
it
was
your
first
point...
whether
this
particular
statute
proscribes
the
answer,
and
therefore,
we
don't
have
to
go
any
further.
why
do
you
say
it
proscribes
the
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
would...
why
would
congress
want
a
different
disposition
for
(f)(1)
than
for
(f)(2)?
it's
clear
under
(f)(2)
if
the
sentence
is
outside
the
applicable
guidelines
and
the...
or
if
the
departure
is
based
on
an
impermissible
factor
or
is
to
an
unreasonable
degree
or
the
sentence
was
imposed
for
an
offense
for
which
there
is
no
applicable
guideline
and
its
plainly
unreasonable,
for
that,
it
is
clear
that
if
it
hasn't
been
raised
by
one
or
the
other
party,
the
court
doesn't
get
into
it.
why
would
it
want
a
different
rule
for
those
two?
in
other
words,
i'm
saying
that
far
from
supporting
your
case,
as
your
brief
suggests,
(f)(2)(a)
and
(a)
seems
to
me
harms
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
it's
too
high
and
the
defendant
has
appealed.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
it's
too
high
and
the
government
has
appealed.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
too
high
and
the
government
has
appealed,
you
don't
get
any
relief
under...
under--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
course,
that
difference
disappears
if
you
say
that,
in
fact,
the
whole
thing
assumes
that
the
factor
complained
of
has
been
brought
to
the
court's
attention
by
the
proper
person.
so
that
(f)(1)
assumes
that
if
it's
the
government
appealing
in
violation
of
law
because
the
defendant
was
given
too
little,
or
if
it's
the
defendant
appealing
because
in
violation
of
law
that
he
was
given
too
much,
it
makes
much
more
sense
that
way,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
enough
to
say,
well,
we've
noticed
by
the
way
we're...
you
know,
in
looking
at
the
proper
appeal
by
the
proper...
my
goodness,
look
what
we've
noticed.
it's
not
that.
you're
saying
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
search
the
record.
it
has
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
errors
in
favor...
or
harming
the
other
party
who
has
not
cross-appealed.
and
that's
a
considerable
burden,
as
judge
boudin's
opinion
on
the
court
of
appeals
makes
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
precisely
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
why
we
have
tried
to
pare
down
what
is
jurisdictional.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
argument
is
not
an
argument
under
the
statute?
this
is
an
argument
giving
your
interpretation
of
what
the
background
rule
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
limit
the
background
rule
to
plain
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
it
was
a
violation
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
we
mean
by
the
"sentencing
packaging
rule"?
justice
antonin
scalia
getting
what
he
deserves,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
(e)
also
contradicts
(f)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--(2)(a)
and
(b)
because
in
some
of
those
cases
it
doesn't
determine
that
if
the
appeal
has
been
brought
by
the
wrong
party.
