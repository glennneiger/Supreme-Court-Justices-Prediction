ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
increasing
petitioner's
sentence
for
two
reasons:
first,
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
do
so
in
the
absence
of
a
notice
of
appeal
by
the
government
under
18
usc
3742(b).
second,
even
assuming
it
did
not
strictly
lack
jurisdiction,
it
nevertheless
violated
the
mandatory
claim-processing
rule
that
a
judgment
may
not
be
increased
in
favor
of
an
appellee
in
the
absence
of
a
timely--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--those
cases
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
finding
of
jurisdictional,
justice
alito,
because
in
those
cases
the
court
of
appeals
has
granted
the
defendant's
requested
relief,
and
it
has
vacated
the
judgment
at
the
request
of
the
defendant.
and
then,
once
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
what
the
district
court
may
lawfully
do
would
turn
on
the
scope
of
the
mandate,
not
on
principles
of
the
cross-appeal
rule.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
found
an
error
at
the
defendant's
request,
yes,
justice
stevens,
and
remanded
it,
depending
on
the
scope
of
the
mandate
and
under
the
scope
of
the
mandate--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--but
it
would
have
been
a
key
difference
in
the
sense
that
they
would
have
found
some
of
the
defendant's
claims
on
appeal
correct.
here
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
all
of
the
defendant's
claims;
and,
nevertheless,
in
the
absence
of
a
government
appeal,
increased
the
petitioner's
sentence.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
it
would
have
depended
on
how
the
mandate
was
worded.
but
if
they
vacated
the
sentence
in
its
entirety
and
remanded
it,
the
district
court
could
have
imposed
a
lawful
sentence
at
that
time.
yes.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
true.
but
i
understood
justice
alito's
hypothetical
to
posit
a
situation
where
at
the
defendant's
request
his
sentence
was
vacated.
and
then
what
the
district
court
could
do
on
remand
would
depend
on
the
scope
of
the
mandate.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
before
the
district
court,
justice
ginsburg,
the
government
would
be
required
to
press
the
law.
and,
as
it
did
here,
the
law
is
that
under
924(c)
this
is
a
second,
or
subsequent,
conviction
in
count
10;
and
it
is
error.
petitioner
should
have
been
sentenced
to
a
second,
or
subsequent,
sentence
of
25
years
on
count
10.
so
if
it
were
back
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
were
free
under
the
scope
of
the
court
of
appeals
mandate
to
impose
sentence,
then
the
government
would
be
obligated
to
argue
the
law
before
the
district
court.
what--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
courts
of
appeals
have
different
rules,
your
honor,
about
whether
or
not
a
general
mandate
of
the
type
that
you
posit
should
be
assumed
to
open
up
all
issues
for
sentencing
or
not.
and
there's
actually
some
disagreement
in
the
circuit
on
what
one
assumes
from
a
general
mandate.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
no,
your
honor.
i
think
rule
35
speaks
to
what
the
district
can
do
within
seven
days
of
renouncing
the
sentence.
once
the
sentence
is
timely
appealed,
if
the
defendant
were
to
prevail
or
if
the
government
were
to
prevail
in
a
case
in
which
the
government
had
actually
appealed
and
it
were
to
be
remanded,
then
the
defendant--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--within
the
scope
of
the
mandate.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
don't
think
it
is
anomalous,
your
honor,
in
a
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
over
a
claim,
grants
the
requested
relief,
and
vacates
the
sentence.
for
then,
what
the
district
court
can
do
can
turn
on
the
scope
of
the
court
of
appeals
mandate.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
don't
know
there's
any
court
of
appeals
that
has
held
that
it
could
do
that.
it--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i'm
not
sure
that
that's...
i
don't
know
the
precise
contours
of
that,
justice
souter,
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
grants
the
petitioner's
request
to
vacate
the
sentence--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--and
then
remands
for
resentencing,
in
a
general
way,
that
could
leave
open
to
the
district
court
the
ability
to
resentence.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
one--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--given
the
lack
of
an
appeal
here.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
by
the
government?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i...
i
suppose
it...
it
might
do
that.
i
suppose
it...
it
might
be
able
to
do
that.
here--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that's
right.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
right.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
because
it...
once
the
court...
if
the
petitioner...
i
mean...
at
any
risk
in
any
appeal,
and
this
is
true
in
civil
cases,
too,
you
know,
if
you
seek
a
new
trial
on
damages,
for
example,
in
a
civil
case,
because
of
instructional
error,
and
you
go
back,
i
think,
you
know,
the
jury
who
decides
the
damages
a
second
time
isn't
bound
by
the
first
jury's
decision.
any
time--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
if
the
court
of
appeals
finds
error
in
the
sentence
it
vacates
under
the...
the
remedial
provisions
in
3742
for
the...
for
the
court...
for
the
district
court
to
resentence
the
petitioner.
for
example--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
if
the
defendant
wins
in
the
sentencing
appeal,
there...
there's
always
a
chance
that
on...
on
remand,
the...
the
district
court
will
reconfigure
the
sentence.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
i
think,
you
know,
if
you
look
at
cases...
recent...
i
think
post-booker
for
example--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--right.
i
was
going
to
use
the
booker
case
as
an
example.
post-booker,
you
know,
defendants
have
appeals,
saying
i
was
innocent,
or
mandatory
guidelines
regime,
and
i
want
to
be
sentenced
under
the
advisory
guidelines
regime.
and
when
those
is
cans
have
gone
back,
this...
courts
of
appeals
have...
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
the
district
court
is
not
bound
by
original
sentence...
it's
not
free
from
the
mandatory
guidelines.
it
can
consider
all
the
factors
as
instructed
by
the
court,
and
isn't
simply
decrease
the
sentence.
and
i
think--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
i
think
in
this
situation,
actually...
it
definitely
is
a
rule
of
appellate
court
procedure.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
and
it's
definitely
a
mandatory--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
that's
correct.
if
you
succeed
on
your
appeal
you
may
end
up
in
the
district
court
worse
off
than
when
you
began.
but
the
issue
before
this
court
is
what
can
a
court
of
appeals
do
in
the
absence
of
a
party
pressing
a
claim
before
it.
and--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--no.
all
they...
all
they're
doing,
your
honor,
as
we
requested,
is
rejecting
the
petitioner's
claims
on
appeal.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
the
government
is
not
agreeing
that
there
was...
with
the
petitioner
there
was
no
deal
error.
what
the
government
is
saying...
the
question
is...
so
this
is
not
a
situation
like
you're
positing,
where
the
parties
are
trying
to
agree
to
the
governing
law.
this
is
a
question
of
which
issues
are
properly
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
start
with.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
fair
enough.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
fair
enough,
but
here
it
is,
there's
no
disagreement
about
what
the
merits
of
the
governing
law
is;
the
question
is,
is
that
question
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
the
government
didn't
cross-appeal,
justice
ginsburg.
but
there
are
good
reasons
why
the
government
wouldn't
cross-appeal
in
any
given
case.
there
are
8,000
plus
adverse
decisions
against
the
government
in
2007,
and
reasons
why
the
government
might
not
cross-appeal
or
appeal
in
a
given
case
include
the
length
of
the
sentence
the
person
has
already
received,
whether
there's
a
need
for
clarification
of
a
particular
question
of
law,
whether
this
is
a
recurring
error--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--but
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
the
amicus
is
arguing
that's
the
meaning
of
3742--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--in
general--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--but
there--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--exactly,
your
honor.
and
that...
the
danger
to
parties,
in
particular
to
the
government
in
having
courts
reach
out
and
arrogate
to
themselves
the
decision...
thank
you...
the
decision
to
appeal
is...
is
illustrated
by
this
particular
case.
in
footnote
6
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
it
recognizes
a
second
error
that
aggrieves
the
government,
deciding
it
was
plain--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
if
i
could
make
two
points.
the
court
of
appeals
actually
found
two
errors
that
aggrieved
the
government
here,
justice
stevens,
and
ruled
for
us
only
on
one.
so
in
a
case
where
we
didn't
notice
an
appeal,
on
an
issue
we
did
not
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
us.
and
second,
i'm
aware
of
no
case
in
this
court
where
this
court
has
reached
out
to
find
plain
error
on
behalf
of
a
nonpetitioning
respondent
or
a
non-appealing
appellate.
