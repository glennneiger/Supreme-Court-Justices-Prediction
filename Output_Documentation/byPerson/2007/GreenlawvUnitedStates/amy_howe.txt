ms.
amy
howe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
over
200
years,
this
court
has
held,
without
exception,
that
an
appellate
court
may
not
modify
a
judgment
in
a
party's
favor
unless
that
party
has
filed
a
notice
of
appeal.
such
a
rule,
this
court
has
explained,
serves
important
interests
in
notice
and
finality.
in
1984,
congress
enacted
the
sentencing
reform
act
against
the
backdrop
of
this
well
settled
rule.
in
18
u.s.c.
section
3742,
congress
provided
for
limited
appellate
review
of
sentencing
errors.
nothing
in
the
text,
structure,
or
history
of
section
3742
reflects
any
intent
by
congress
to
deviate
from
the
inveterate
and
certain
cross-appeal
rule,
nor
is
there
any
reason
why
sentencing
appeals
should
be
treated
any
differently
from
other
appeals.
instead,
section
reflects
traditional
principles
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
in--
ms.
amy
howe
--no.
it
could
not
have
because
the
government--
ms.
amy
howe
--if...
he
would
have
been
foreclosed,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
howe
simply
that
the...
the
district--
ms.
amy
howe
--this
is
a...
the
case
actually
in
united
states
versus
harvey,
which
was
a
case
out
of
the
third
circuit,
and,
although
the
district
court
could
order
the
same
sentence,
it
can't
increase
the
sentence.
yes.
it
would
be
circumventing
the
cross-appeal
rule.
ms.
amy
howe
no.
it's
based
on
the
cross-appeal
rule.
ms.
amy
howe
certainly.
i
mean,
our
argument
would
be
that
the...
you
know,
if
the
court
of
appeals
can't
order
the
sentence
increased,
that
on
remand
the
district
court
couldn't
circumvent
the
cross-appeal
rule
by
increasing
the
sentence
as
well.
ms.
amy
howe
no,
that's
certainly
true,
that
it
would
be
circumventing
the
cross-appeal
rule
to
allow
the
district
court
to
do
something
that--
ms.
amy
howe
--yes,
under
this
rule.
ms.
amy
howe
yes,
the
district
court
has,
i
believe,
seven
days
to
correct
the
sentence.
ms.
amy
howe
no.
this
would
not
be
a
mathematical
error,
but--
ms.
amy
howe
--yes,
we--
ms.
amy
howe
--perhaps.
ms.
amy
howe
i
think
it
might
be
different
if
it
were...
if
there
were
a
new
trial
on
the
same
indictment.
but...
you
know,
going
back
to
the
cross-appeal
rule,
i
mean,
the
court
of
appeals
could...
the
district
court
could
certainly
impose
the
same
sentence.
ms.
amy
howe
well,
our
argument
would
be
that
the
government
had
forfeited
the
right
to
make
that
argument
and
that
the
district
court
would
not
be...
you
know,
that
would
essentially
be
sua
sponte
ordering--
ms.
amy
howe
--you
know,
if
the
government
had--
ms.
amy
howe
--new
judgment
and
conviction...
it...
the
rule
may
be
different.
unless
double
jeopardy
may
apply
as
well.
ms.
amy
howe
i...
i'm
not
sure.
ms.
amy
howe
42.
ms.
amy
howe
certainly,
justice
ginsburg.
and
that...
this
is
reprinted
on
page
5a
of
the
government's
brief.
and
the
inference
that
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
you're
drawing
and
that
the
amicus
would
have
you
draw
is
that
the
fact
that
the
subsection
(f)(2),
which
is
on
page
6a,
subsection
(f)(2)(a)
and
(b)
refer
to
whether
the
appeal
has
been
filed;
whereas,
subsection
(f)(1)
says
not,
which
means
that,
in
some
circumstances,
the
cross-appeal
rule
does
not
apply
in
circumstances
such
as
that.
but
our
interpretation,
which
we
think
is
the
correct
one,
is
that
the
only
reason
that
subsection
(f)(1)
does
not
refer
to
whether
an
appeal
has
been
filed
is
that
subsection
(f)(1)
refers
to
the
kind
of
claims
that
both
defendants
and
the
government
can
bring;
whereas,
subsection
(f)(2)
parallels
subsections
(a)(3)
and
(b)(3),
but
(c),
only
the
defendant
can
appeal
an
upward
departure;
only
the
government
can
appeal
a
downward
departure.
and
our
interpretation,
again,
which
we
think
is
the
correct
one,
is
that
subsection
(f)(1)
doesn't
need
to
refer
to
whether
an
appeal
has
been
filed,
because...
because
both
the
defendant
and
the
government
can
bring
those
kinds
of
appeals.
and
even
if
you
don't
agree
with
that
interpretation,
i
think
it's
worth
noting
that
the
amicus...
that
the
amicus's
construction
is
further
flawed
for
three
reasons.
and
the
first
is
that
that
would
cause
subsection
(f)(2)
to
operate
illogically.
there's
no
reason
why
the...
for
example,
if
you
had
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
had
appealed
and
the
government
had
not
appealed,
under
this
interpretation
the
court
of
appeals
could
increase
a
sentence
if
it
found
there
had
been
a
misapplication
of
the
guidelines
that
would
result
in
an
increase
in
the
defendant's
sentence;
but
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
be
allowed
to
increase
the
defendant's
sentence
if
it
found
that
there
was
an
unwarranted
downward
departure,
because
the
government
had
filed
a
notice
of
appeal.
we
don't
think...
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
we
don't
think
there's
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
intended
for
it
to
operate
this
way.
the
second
reason
is
that
this
is
a
very
thin
reed
to
rest
this
construction
of
the
statute
on,
given
that
congress
must
have
been
aware
of
the
cross-appeal
rule.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
it
would
have
departed
from
two
centuries
of
appellate
practice
in
this
way,
based
on
this...
this
very
thin
reed,
and
in
fact
we
know
from
the
organized
crime
control
act
of
1970
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
cross-appeal
rule
because
in
that
case
it
expressly
carved
out
that
exception--
ms.
amy
howe
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
amy
howe
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
ms.
amy
howe
well--
ms.
amy
howe
--i
have
three
points,
justice
breyer.
the
first
is
that
congress
must
have
been
aware
of
this
scenario
in
particular
because
in
the
organized
crime
control
act
of
1970,
when
the
government
appeals,
that...
in
those
provisions,
that
brought
up
the
defendant's
sentence
and
his
conviction
for
review.
and
congress
decided,
for
whatever
reason,
not
to
continue
that...
that
exception
to
the
cross-appeal
rule
when
it
enacted
the
sentencing
reform
act.
the
second
point,
justice
breyer,
is
that
we're
not
aware
that
there's
actually
any
body
of
case
law
in
which
this
happened.
no
one
has
pointed
to
any
cases
in
which
this
has
actually
happened.
the--
ms.
amy
howe
--the
cross-appeal
rule
itself
is
not
statutory,
but--
ms.
amy
howe
--it
is
indeed,
justice
stevens,
but--
ms.
amy
howe
--it
is
not
surprising,
but
we
know
from
the
organized
crime
control
act
that
congress
certainly
was
aware
of
the
cross-appeal
rule,
because
in
that
case
it
did
carve
out
a
limited
exception.
and
my
third
point,
justice
breyer,
returning
to
your
question,
is
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
may
well
have
an
argument,
may
be
able
to
seek
post-conviction
relief
under
section
2255,
as
the
government
acknowledges
in
its
brief.
so
he
may
be
able
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
under
section
2255
and
obtain
relief
in
that
manner.
ms.
amy
howe
well,
we
do
believe
it
is
jurisdictional,
justice
scalia.
in
the
morley
case,
which
we
think--
ms.
amy
howe
--we
believe
it
is
both
well-established
and
jurisdictional.
and
we
believe,
in
particular,
when
you're
talking
about
sentencing,
even
if
you
don't
agree
with
us
that
the
cross-appeal
rule
generally
is
jurisdiction,
we
believe
that
section
3742
is
jurisdictional.
because
it
sets
out
in
subsections
a
and
b,
the
kinds
of
errors
that
defendants
and
the
government
can
bring.
but
we
also
believe
that
it
ultimately
doesn't
matter
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
because
even
if,
as
amicus
concedes,
it
is
merely
a
rule
of
practice,
it
is
a
rule
of
practice
that
is
not
subject
to
exception,
and
mr.
greenlaw
timely
invoked
it
at
his
earliest
opportunity.
ms.
amy
howe
absolutely.
ms.
amy
howe
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
certainly
does
not
apply
it.
the
tenth
circuit--
ms.
amy
howe
--they
acknowledge.
ms.
amy
howe
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
both
regard
it
is
a
rule
of
practice
that
may
be
subject
to
exceptions
and
exceptional
circumstances.
but,
even
if
it
is
a
rule
of
practice,
justice
scalia,
we
still
prevail
because
mr.
greenlaw
has
timely
invoked
it
at
his
earliest
opportunity
and
because
in
a
sentencing
context
it
is
not
subject
to
any
exception.
ms.
amy
howe
it
makes
a
difference,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
sense
that
it
cannot
be
waived
if
it
is
jurisdictional.
the
court
can
raise
it
at
any
time.
if
it
is
a
rule
of
practice,
it
is
subject
to
exception
below.
in
this...
as
in
this
case
with
this
rule,
the
court
has
not
found
an
exception
in
over
200
years.
the...
in
the
sentencing
context
in
particular,
it
is
not
subject
to
exception.
and
mr.
greenlaw
timely
invoked
it.
if
this
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
amy
howe
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
two
points.
the
first
is
that
the
amicus
argues
that
subsection
(e)
of
section
3742
provides
the
answer
in
this
case:
that
upon
a
review
of
the
record
the
court
of
appeals
shall
determine.
and
so
his
argument
is
that
this
authorizes
and,
in
fact,
requires
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
any
of
the
errors
that
are
outlined
in
subsection
(e)
have
occurred.
but
(e)
can't
possibly
be
this
sort
empowering,
roving,
free-standing
authority
that
the
amicus
believes
it
is.
because
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
subsection
(e),
all
it
provides...
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
it
merely
provides
the
scope
of
review...
that,
upon
review
of
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals
shall
determine.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
a
notice
of
appeal
has
been
filed,
how
the
record
got
there.
and
to
figure
out
those
things
you
have
to
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute.
and
when
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
it
is
clear
that
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
are
the
provisions
that
provide
for
appellate
jurisdiction
in
sentencing
cases.
amicus
also
tries
to
argue
that,
you
know--
ms.
amy
howe
--(f)(2)and
then--
ms.
amy
howe
--that's
absolutely
right.
that
merely
provides
the
remedy,
justice
scalia.
and
the
amicus
tries
also
to
argue
that
this
is
not
some
sort
of
free-standing,
roving
appellate
authority.
that,
you
know,
for
example,
if
the
case
is
brought
under
(a)(1),
a
violation
of
law,
the
court
of
appeals
only
needs
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
violation
of
law.
but
he
also
argued
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
obligated
to
scour
the
record
for
errors.
it
is
only
to
notice
plain
error.
but
if
one
should
start
placing
these
limits,
these
limits
come
from
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
and
the
background
of
traditional
appellate
practice.
and
once
you
start
placing
these
limits
which
do
not
appear
in
the
text
on
subsection
(e),
the
entire
construction
falls
apart.
the
second
point
i
would
make
is
that
the
amicus
argues
that,
somehow,
section
3742
represents
as
a
break
from
the
past;
that
congress
did
not
have
in
mind
the
background
of
this
well-established
appellate
procedure.
but
in
section
3742
congress
made
clear...
may
i
finish...
it
was
only
providing
for
limited
appellate
review.
and
if
you
are
going
to
treat
sentencing
cases
differently
in
light
of
this
court's
historic
practice
of
construing
the
availability
of
government
appeals
narrow
rate,
you
need
to
treat...
you
need
to
be
even
more
reluctant
to
deviate--
