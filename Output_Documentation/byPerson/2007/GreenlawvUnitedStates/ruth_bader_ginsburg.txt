justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
based
on
any...
any
precedent
of
this
court's?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
just
on
the
cross-appeal
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
would
not
be
a
mathematical
error?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
double
jeopardy
if
it's
a
new
judge?
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
go
back
to
where
you
started,
and
that
was
with
the
statute,
37...
what
is
it?
42?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--(f).
and
the...
that
has
two
subparts,
and
the
first
part
just
says
the
court
of
appeals
can
decide
whether
a
sentence
was
imposed
in
violation
of
law,
period.
and
(2)
has
two
subparts
that
refer
to
the
party
appealing.
so
why
doesn't
the
first
one
cover
both
sides
when
the
second
one
is
distinctly
divided
into
(a)
and
(b)
parts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
difference
does
it
make?
now,
you
said
this
is
a
jurisdictional
rule
because
its
no
rule.
what
difference
does
it
make
if
it
is
labeled
"jurisdictional",
or
if
it
is
just
regarded
as
a
tight
procedural
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
the
prosecution
didn't
ask
for
it?
i
thought
that
you
were
relying
on
the
division
of
authority
between
the
executive,
the
prosecutor,
and
the
court.
and
that
is
that
a
court
reacts
to
the
charges
that
the
prosecutor
brings,
and
if
the
prosecutor
isn't
asking
for
a
higher
sentence,
the
court
has
no
authority
to
grant
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
why
wouldn't
the
prosecutor
still
have
control
and
say:
judge,
the
government
is
asking
for
ten
years,
no
more?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
the
government
cross-appeal
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jorgensen,
suppose
i
think
there's
a
larger
anterior
question
to
all
of
this?
and
that
is
what
i
suggested
in
the
colloquy
with
ms.
howe,
we
have
a
system
in
which
the
prosecutor
can
bring
charges.
the
judge
may
think,
my
goodness,
looking
at
this
set
of
facts,
you
could
have
charged
much
more.
the
judge
can't
do
that,
he
can't
tell
the
prosecutor
you
have
to
charge
"y"
in
addition
to
"x".
the
government
chooses
not
to
appeal.
now,
what
right
does
the
court
say,
i
know
you
didn't
appeal,
government,
but
should
have
so
we're
going
to
take
care
of
it
for
you?
it
seems
to
me
that
our
system
rests
on
a
principle
of
party
presentation
as
many
systems
do
not.
in
many
systems,
the
court
does
shape
the
controversy
and
can
intrude
issues
on
its
own.
but
in
our
adversarial
system,
we
rely
on
counsel
to
do
that
kind
of
thing.
so,
my
problem
with
your
whole
position,
without
getting
down
to
particular
statutory
provisions,
is
what
business
does
the
court
have
to
put
an
issue
in
the
case
that
counsel
chose
not
to
raise?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
he
doesn't
have
to
pursue
it
if
the
government
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
understand
that
a
party
couldn't
voluntarily
withdraw
a
notice
of
appeal.
i
mean,
suppose
the
only
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
get
into
this
is
because
the
defendant
has
pursued
an
appeal.
suppose
this
comes
up
and
the
defendant
says,
oh,
my
goodness,
i
stand
to
get
15
more
years
in
prison;
i'm
withdrawing
my
notice
of
appeal.
there's
nothing
before
the
court
of
appeals
then.
nothing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
petitioner,
michael
greenlaw
was
convicted
of
several
drug
and
firearm
felonies,
and
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
nearly
37
years.
in
calculating
his
total
sentence,
the
district
court
made
a
mistake
overlooking
a
controlling
decision
of
this
court
and
despite
the
government's
objection,
the
district
court
imposed
a
10-year
sentence
on
account
that
carried
a
25-year
mandatory
minimum
term.
greenlaw
appealed
urging
among
other
things
that
his
sentence
was
too
high.
anything
more
than
15
years
total,
he
argued,
would
be
excessive.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
all
of
greenlaw's
arguments
but
it
did
not
stop
there.
although,
the
government
had
not
asked
for
a
higher
sentence
by
appealing
or
cross-appealing,
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
initiative
held
that
greenlaw's
sentence
was
too
low
and
ordered
the
district
court
to
add
15
years
to
his
prison
term.
we
vacate
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
and
hold
that
because
the
government
did
not
appeal
or
cross-appeal,
greenlawâ€™s
sentence
should
not
have
been
enlarged.
in
both
civil
and
criminal
cases
in
the
first
instance,
and
not
appeal,
courts
in
the
united
states
generally
followed
the
principle
of
party
presentation,
that
means
the
parties
and
not
the
court
frame
the
issues
for
decision
and
the
courts
play
a
reactive
role,
they
serve
as
impartial
arbiters
of
matters,
the
parties
present
to
them.
the
cross-appeal
rule,
pivotal
in
this
case,
is
both
informed
by,
and
illustrative
of
the
party
presentation
principle.
under
that
rule,
appellate
courts
may
not
reach
out
to
correct
the
sentencing
error
when
the
government
has
not
invited
such
error
correction
by
appealing
or
cross-appealing.
in
other
words,
it
takes
a
cross-appeal
to
justify
a
remedy
in
favor
of
the
appellee.
this
court
has
called
the
cross-appeal
rule
inveterate
and
certain,
and
has
in
no
case,
ordered
an
exception
to
it.
no
exception
is
warranted
here.
a
provision
congress
enacted
guides
our
decision,
congress
instructed
that
the
government
may
not
pursue
an
appeal
of
a
criminal
sentence
without
the
personal
approval
of
the
attorney
general,
the
solicitor
general
or
the
solicitor
general's
designated
deputy.
this
provision
gives
the
top
representatives
of
the
united
states
in
litigation,
the
prerogative
to
seek
or
forgo
appellate
correction
of
sentencing
errors,
however
plain
they
may
be.
we
would
diminish
the
force
of
that
instruction
while
we
permit
appellate
courts
to
overwrite
the
assessment
of
those
justice
department
officers.
for
these
reasons
and
others
detailed
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
ordering
greenlaw's
sentence
increased
even
though
the
government
did
not
ask
for
a
higher
sentence
by
pursuing
a
cross-appeal.

dissenting
opinion

which
