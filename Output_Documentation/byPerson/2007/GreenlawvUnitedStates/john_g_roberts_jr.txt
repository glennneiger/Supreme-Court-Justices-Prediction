chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-330,
greenlaw
versus
united
states.
ms.
howe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
it
would
depend
on
what
the
mandate
from
the
court
of
appeals
said.
if
the
mandate
said
the
sentence
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
resentencing,
it
seems
to
me
that
leaves
open
the
full
range
of
legitimate
sentencing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
court
of
appeals...
if
your
argument
is
correct,
the
court
of
appeals
is
limited
solely
by
virtue
of
the
failure
to
file
a
notice
of
cross-appeal.
that...
that's
a
limitation
that
wouldn't
apply
in
the
district
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
howe.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
usually
the
mandate
in
these
cases
simply
says,
you
know,
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court.
if
that's
all
the
mandate
says,
does
that
authorize
the
district
court
to
do
the
right
thing
under
the
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the...
the
defendant
who
is
appealing
has
to
be
very
careful
about
the
relief
he
requests?
he
says
i
don't
want
the
sentence
vacated;
i
want
the
sentence
reduced
to
five
years
instead
of
10.
and
nothing
else?
that's
the
only
relief
i
seek?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
that
context,
aren't...
aren't
you
concerned
about
enlisting
the
court
of
appeals
in
doing
something
illegal?
i
mean,
they
know
that
what
they're
authorizing,
or
imposing
really,
as
a
sentence
is
illegal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
reminded
of
what
we
do
in
statutory
cases.
if
one
party
says
this
is,
it
should
be
read
a,
and
the
other
party
says
it
should
be
read
b,
we've
had
cases
where
we
say,
well,
they're
both
wrong,
and
we're
going
to
read
the
statute
as
c
because
we
the
court
want
to
do
the
right
thing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
in
my
hypothetical
they
weren't
agreeing.
one
side
was
saying
b,
the
other
side
was
saying
a.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
right
answer
was
c.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
problem
of
getting
the
solicitor
general's
office
to
authorize
the
appeal?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
maynard.
mr.
jorgensen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's
discretionary,
how
would
you...
i
assume
it's
reviewable
for
abuse
of
discretion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
would
you
know
whether
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
not?
i
mean,
the
issue
is
going
to
be
the
same
in
every
case.
there
was
no
cross-appeal.
if
there
had
been,
we
would
have
increased
the
sentence,
and
one
court
of
appeals
says,
well,
we're
not
going
to
do
it;
and
the
other
court
of
appeals
says,
yes,
we're
going
to
do
it.
which
one
is
reversed
for
abuse
of
discretion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
might
say
that.
but
i
mean...--
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
it's
such
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
it's
such
a
plain
error,
it's
fair
to
to
ask
why
the
government
didn't
cross-appeal.
if
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
howe,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
miss
howe.
mr.
jorgensen,
you
have
briefed
and
argued
this
case
as
an
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
judgment
below
on
appointment
by
the
court.
we
thank
you
for
undertaking
and
discharging
that
assignment.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-330,
greenlaw
versus
united
states.
