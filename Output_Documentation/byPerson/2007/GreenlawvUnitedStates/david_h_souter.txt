justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
understand
your
mandate
rule
as
being
consistent
with
your
general
theory
of
the
case.
because
if
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
order
this
kind
of
relief,
how
could
it
be
that
the
court
of
appeals'
mandate
would
authorize
the
relief?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you've
either
got
to
take
the
position
that
the
mandate
is,
in
effect,
a
kind
of
neutral
order.
the
district
courts
may
or
may
not
have
authority
to
do
something
after
the
mandate
comes
down.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
take
the
position
that
the
mandate,
itself,
by
the
court
of
appeals
will,
itself,
determine
what
the
district
court
can
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
because,
in
effect,
i
think
you
are
saying,
by
structuring
the
mandate
in
a
certain
way,
the
court
of
appeals
can
open
the
door
to
something
that
the
court
of
appeals,
itself,
could
not
do.
but
by
structuring
the
mandate
in
a
different
way,
the
court
of
appeals
can
cut
off
the
possibility
of
district
court
orders
of
a
sort
that
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
do.
and
that
seems...
that
is
what
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
your
theory
of
the
limited
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
let's
consider...
assuming
that
the
mandate
leaves
open...
the
question
open
entirely
for
the
district
court.
you
said
ultimately
what
the
district
court
can
do
depends
on
the
mandate.
can
the
court
of
appeals
also
by
mandate
say:
and
by
the
way,
district
court,
because
we
couldn't
increase
the
sentence
here,
you
can't
do
it
either?
is
that
open
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
is
the
play
in
the
mandate
that
you
are
assuming
when
you
say
it
depends
on
the
mandate?
what
the
district
court
can
do
would
depend
on
the
mandate.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
is
the...
what
option
does
the
court
of
appeals...
given
the
limits
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
itself
can
order,
what
are
the
options
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
in
writing
the
mandate
that
will
determine
what
the
district
court
can
do?
what
are
you
getting
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
now
you
say
that
could
leave
open...
if
a
mandate
is
general,
that
could
leave
open.
can
the
mandate
be
specific
in
precluding?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
if
that's
the
case,
if
the...
if
the...
if
it
cannot
be
structured
by
the
request
for
relief
as
the
chief
justice
is
suggesting,
then
on
the
government's
theory,
in
a
case
like
this,
if
the
defendant
wins
on
appeal,
he
is
in
serious
trouble
when
that
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court;
whereas
if
he
loses,
he
can't
be
any
worse
off
than
he
is
now.
that's
a
strange...
that's
a
strange
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
effect
that
means
then...
and
this...
i
didn't
understand
this
to
be
your
position...
but
that
means,
in
effect,
that
the
cross-appeal
rule
is
essentially,
as
you're
arguing
for
it,
a
formality.
it
limits
what
the
district
court
can
do,
but
it
is
not
a
rule
that
embodies
the
notion
that
when
a
defendant
appeals
the
defendant
ought
to
know,
in
effect,
what
he
can
gain
and
what
he
can
lose;
because
if,
on
your
theory,
if
the
defendant
wins
and
there's
a
mandate
back
to
the
district
court,
it
is
wide
open.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
want
to
look
at
them
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is
first.
and
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
the
defendant
wins,
and
he
cannot
by
his
request
for
leave
limit
the
relief,
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
then
when
the
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
in
effect,
the
slate
is
totally
blank
and
he's
starting
all
over
again
and
he
is
subject
to...
to
whatever
outer
limits
he
would
have
been
subject
to
in
the
first
instance.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
cross-appeals
rule
is
essentially
a
rule
of
appellate
court
procedure
and
nothing
more.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it
doesn't
go
beyond
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
a
blunder?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
jorgensen,
may
i
take
you
back
to
something
you
mentioned
earlier
in
the
argument?
and
i
thought
i
followed
it
at
the
time,
and
i
may
not
have
understood
you.
as
i
recall,
you
were
explaining
the
difference
between
(f)(1)
and
(f)(2)(a)
and
(b)
by
saying
that
in
(f)(1),
which
was...
which
does
not
embody
any
condition
on
who
has
appealed--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
concern
is
that,
if
there
is
an
error,
it's
an
error
which
will
in
effect
infect
all
cases.
it's
a
circuit
error,
and
it's
potentially
there
for
any
case
that
comes
along
for
sentencing;
whereas,
in
(f)(2),
if
there's
an
error,
the
limited
damage
is
simply
to
the
case
itself,
to
the
particular
defendant.
where
i
don't
follow
that
reasoning
is
in
the
fact
that
f
1
refers
not
only
to
an
incorrect...
to
a
violation
of
law,
but
incorrect
application
of
sentencing
guidelines,
which
would
seem
to
include
a...
the
particulars
of
a
given
case.
so
am
i
either
misunderstanding
your
argument
or
maybe
misunderstanding
subsection
1.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
all
it
said,
i
would
certainly
understand
your
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
the
problem
i
still
have
is
some
incorrect
applications
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
pre-booker
were,
in
fact,
violations
of
law.
but
not
all
of
them
were,
any
more
than
all
of
them
are
now.
but
forget
the
situation
now.
not
all
of
them
were.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
draw
the
sort
of
nonporous
distinction
that
you
are
drawing.
i
mean
it
is
a
good
try;
but
even
pre-booker
there
are
some
incorrect
applications
that
could
have
been
corrected
on
an
abuse
standard
that
were
not
properly
described
as
violations
of
law
per
se.
