justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
i've
been
thinking
about
this
case.
supposing
your
client
prevailed
on
appeal
and
they
held
a
resentencing.
could
the
district
judge
have
increased
the
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
district
judge
could
not
have
increased
it?
if
they
sent
it
back
for
a
new
sentencing,
a
fresh
hearing
on
what
the
sentencing
should
be,
would
the
district
judge
have
been
foreclosed
from
giving
a
higher
sentence
than
he
gave
the
first
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say,
if
it
was
a
capital
case
and
he
won
on
appeal,
he
could
get
the
death
sentence
the
second
time
around,
which
is
a
little
more
serious
sentence.
why
couldn't
he
have
gotten
a
higher
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
believe
you
say
it
has
decided
not
to
make
an
exception
to
the
cross-appeal
rule.
of
course,
the
cross-appeal
rule
itself
is
not
statutory,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
an
arguable
rule
among
the
courts
of
appeal
as
to
whether
there
is
such
a
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
not
surprising
that
congress
didn't
make
exception
to
a
rule
that
isn't
that
firmly
established.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
this
very
case
could
the
court
of
appeals
said:
we
will
grant
the
appellant
a
new
sentencing
hearing
and
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
for
resentencing;
and,
by
the
way,
district
judge,
when
you
do
the
resentencing,
take
a
look
at
the
section
that
imposes
a
mandatory
minimum?
could
they
have
done
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
could
have
ended
up
with
precisely
the
same
result
that
they
ended
up
with
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
one
question?
this
problem
has
been
around
for
a
long,
long
time;
and
sometimes
cross-appeals...
courts
of
appeals
have
corrected
what
they
thought
was
plain
error,
and
without
a
cross-appeal
there.
has
that
generated
a
whole
lot
of
problems
over
the
years?
i
mean
there
are
isolated
cases
that
you've
all
been
able
to
find
searching
30
or
40
years
of
jurisprudence,
but
i
don't
see
any
widespread
problem
being
generated
by
the
courts
of
appeals
who
have
disagreed
with
your
view.
