mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
questions
really
in
this
case,
and
the
court
need
not
resolve
all
of
them
depending
upon
how
it
resolves
the
others,
but
some
of
them
get
lost
sometimes,
so
i
would
like
to
state
what
the
three
are.
the
three
are
first,
does
section
3742
provide
an
answer?
is
it
an
affirmative
grant
of
power
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
eighth
circuit
to
give
the
right
answer
when
the
petitioner
asked
them
is
my
sentence
imposed
in
violation
of
law?
or
is
it
a
limit
on
the
court's
power
telling
them
they
cannot
provide
him
with
relief?
that's
the
first
question.
if
the
court
concludes
that
it's
neither...
if
a
court
a
court
concludes
either
that
it
is
a
grant
of
jurisdiction,
or
rather
a
power...
or
that
it's
not,
that
it's
an
affirmative
limit,
then
the...
if
the
court
concludes
that
3742
is
more
like
1291,
just
a
general
appellate
statute
that
does
not
give
the
answer
here,
then
the
court
has
to
go
on
to
decide
is
this
case...
is
this
rule,
this
cross-appeal
rule,
in
the
criminal
context
not
the
civil
context
that
is...
that
is
subject
of
this
200
years
of
discussion,
but
in
the
criminal
context
is
it
a
jurisdictional
limit
on
what
the
courts
can
do
or
is
it
a
rule
of
practice.
and
then
finally,
if
the
court
concludes...
if
the
court
concludes
it
is
a
jurisdictional
limit,
then
that's
the
end.
if
the
court
concludes
that
it
is
a
rule
of
practice,
the
final
third
question
is:
is
it
a
waivable
rule
of
practice
or
is
it
a
firm
and
inflexible
rule
of
practice?
i
think
what
often
gets
assumed.
but,
of
course,
in
kontrick,
in
bowles,
the
court
addresses
the
issue
in
that
case...
in
those
cases
and
decides
whether
the
rule
of
practice
at
issue
in
that
case--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
ginsburg,
is
multi-part,
and
i'll
try
to
move
through
it
quickly.
this
court
had
said...
made
the
very
point
that
you
made
at
the
charging
stage.
that
at
the
charging
stage
the
court...
the
district
court
cannot
decide
what
a
criminal
will
be
charged
with;
but
that
once
the
trial
has
proceeded
to
judgment,
that
prosecutorial
discretion
is
at
an
end.
i
wish
i
could
remember
the
name
of
the
case,
but
justice
scalia
was
the
author.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
the
point
being
that
once
a
crime
has
been
proven,
the
law
kicks
in,
and
the
defendant
must
be
sentenced
in
accordance
with
lawful.
the
same
is
true
on
appeal.
i'm
not
advocating
here
for,
i
think,
what
your
question
would
assume,
which
would
be
a
roving
court
of
jurisdiction...
a
roving
court
of
appeals
that
could
reach
out
and
take
jurisdiction
over
a
case
that
has
not
been
brought
to
it.
under
3742
no
one
questions
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
over
the
very
sentencing
issues
because
somebody
has
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
brought
it
to
the
court.
the
only
question
is
when
the
defendant
says
to
the
court
under
3742(a)(1)
was
my
sentence
imposed
and
the
statutory
languages
in
violation
of
law,
can
the
eighth
circuit
provide
the
right
answer
or
is
it
powerless
to
provide
the
right
answer
to
only
provide
an
answer
that
benefits
him?
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
i
believe
that
it
does,
justice,
because
everybody
agrees
that
the
sentencing
reform
act
was
a
clean
break
with
the
past
and
imposed
an
entirely
new
regime.
so,
the
talk
about
the
regime
of
the
past
is
somewhat
beside
the
point.
so
then
you
get
down
to
the
language
itself
of
section
3742.
under
(a),
it
provides
that
a
defendant
may
ask
the
court
of
appeals
was
my
sentence
imposed
in
violation
of
law;
and
under
(b)(1),
the
government
can
raised
same
appeal.
then
under
(d),
the
parties
certify
to
the
court
or
bring
to
the
court
the
record
that
they
think
addresses
the
issue
that
either
side
raised;
and
then
in
(e),
the
court...
(e)
says
the
court
shall
decide
whether
it
was
imposed
in
violation
of
law;
and
then
(f)(1)
says
if
the
court
determines
that
it
was
imposed
in
violation
of
law,
it
shall
send
it
back
with
instructions.
now,
the
main
answer
to
that
is
well,
(f)(1)...
you
have
to
get
all
the
way
to
(f)(1)
before
you
have
got
the
answer.
and
that's
unsurprising.
i
don't
think
any
member
of
the
court
would
say
that
the
eighth
circuit
lacks
the
power,
is
barred
from
noticing
the
924(c)
error
here.
certainly
the
eighth
circuit
could
see
it;
certainly
the
eighth
circuit
could
say
it.
i
see
the
error
here.
the
only
question
is,
can
it
provide
the
remedy?
and
that's
what
(f)(1)
says.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
if
i
can
give
a
two-part
answer,
justice.
first,
the
court
is
not
in
the
practice
of
overturning
what
the
plain
language
says
on
a
sort
of
legislative
history
or
surmising
what
congress
may
have
been
motivated
by.
but
even
if
it
were,
there
is
a
clear
answer.
(f)(1)
subsumes
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)
and
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2).
and
the
questions
under
those
statutes
or
rather
those
provisions
are
legal
questions.
the
kind
of
questions
was
this
sentence
imposed
under
(a)(1),
(b)(1)
in
violation
of
law
or
(a)(2),
(b)(2),
was
it
an
incorrect
application
of
sentencing
guidelines?
if
the
court
of
appeals
gets
that
wrong,
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that's
going
to
be
imposed
in
everybody
else's
case.
under
(3)
and
(4)
it's
this
defendant's
case.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
indeed.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
you're
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
so
the
question
is,
why
would
congress
say
what
is
plainly
said,
which
is
under
(f)(1)
violations
of
law
and
incorrect
applications
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
the
court
gives
the
right
answer
no
matter
who
appeals.
but
under
(f)(2)
congress
specifies
it
matters
under
this
who
appeals.
and
the
reason
is,
in
those
instances,
it
is
too
high
in
this
defendant's
case,
and
this
defendant
can
be
entrusted
to
forward
his
own
cause;
but
under
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2),
then
you
get
a
court
of
appeals
precedent
that
gives
the
wrong
answer,
if
a
question
of
law
or
the
application
of
the
sentencing
guidelines.
so
there
is
a
difference
between
(a)(1),
(a)(2),
(b)(1),
(b)(2)
as--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--that...
that...
if
the
court
were
to
go
there,
justice,
i
believe
that
goes
back
to
you
previous
question
of:
should
we
assume
or
should
the
court
believe
that
congress
was
aware
of
its
history--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--it
is
a
very--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--well,
importantly,
justice,
one,
two,
three,
and
four,
one
being:
is
it
posed
in
violation
of
law?
two:
is
it
incorrection
application
of
sentencing
guideline
(c)(3)?
or
is
it
too
high?
there's
a
body
of
case
law
as
to
what
kind
of
a
field...
fields
fit
within
what
category.
and
the
parties
and
the
courts
of
appeals
are
united
in
believing
that
the
petitioner's
question
in
this
case
fits
within
(a)(1):
was
his
sentence
imposed
in
vital
of
law.
but,
as
you
know,
the
court
created
the
reasonableness
question
in
booker,
and
then
the
courts
of
appeals
have
agreed
that
that
fits
in
within
(a)(1).
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
indeed.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
indeed,
although
it
is
what
3742
says,
and
i
believe
it's
actually
not
that
different
than
what
happens
with
jurisdictional
issues.
the
court
must
resolve
those
that
are
brought
to
it.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
and
then
the
court
notices
the
ones
that
are
obvious,
has
a
duty
to
look
for
them
because--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--and
on
that
question,
i...
before
the
time
runs
out,
i
want
to,
justice
scalia,
follow
up
on
your
question,
which
is:
what
if
the
court
assumes
that
3742
does
not
provide
the
answer?
which
is
i
believe
where
you're
going.
then
the
court
confronts
the
question
of,
is
the
cross-appeal
rule
jurisdictional
or
a
rule
of
practice?
now,
the
court
has
provided
the
answer
to
that
once
in,
i
believe
it
said,
langnes,
and
said
that
it
is
a
rule
of
practice.
and
then
since,
there's
been
obviously
a
long
period
of
time.
and
then
the
court
has
had
its
series
of
cases
contra
bowles,
arbaugh.
and
under
those
cases,
there
is
no
good
argument
that
it's
jurisdictional.
the
teachings
of
those
cases
is
that
the
court
has
used
the
phrases
"power"
and
"jurisdiction"
too
broadly,
too
loosely,
and
is
now,
as
you
say,
trying
to
cut
back
on
those
jurisdictional
limits.
and
a
rule
like
this
can
only
be
jurisdictional
if
it's
based
on
a
statute,
and
i
believe
all
the
parties
agree
this
rule
is
not
based
on
a
statute.
so
then
that
gets
us
finally
to
the
question
of,
if
3742
does
not
provide
the
answer
and
it
is
a
rule
of
practice,
is
it
a
mandatory
rule
of
practice,
an
inflexible
rule
of
practice?
or
one
where
the
court
can
use
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
to
apply
it
when
it's
invoked?
and
the...
there
can
be
no
question
that
there
are
discretionary
rules
of
practice.
indeed,
in
bowles,
the
one
issue
on
which
all
nine
justices
agreed
is
just
that:
justice
souter,
writing
for
the
dissent,
would
have
found
that
that
rule
or
practice
was
discretionary.
justice
thomas,
writing
for--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--indeed.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
i
believe
the
one
that
refused
to
correct
such
a
plain
error,
obviously.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
but
your
question
was,
what
is
the
standard?
if
i
may,
i
believe
that's
the
question.
and
the
court
has,
i
think,
provided
the...
several
formulations
of
what
the
standard
is.
in
langnes,
the
court
said
good
cause
was
the
standard.
in
reynolds,
which
contrary
to
what
petitioner
said
was
a
case
where
this
court
afforded
relief
on
a
sentence
to
a
criminal
petitioner
who
had
not
brought
that
issue
to
this--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--i--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--i
believe
it
does
work,
justice
breyer.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
and
i
believe
it--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
yes...
yes,
your
honor,
i
would.
and
that
does
not
really
contradict
what
the
eighth
circuit
did
here.
rule
52(b)
is
really
another
formulation
of
the
very
same
thing
that
the
court
said
in
langnes;
that's
good
cause.
in
neztsosie,
it...
the
court
phrased
it
"countervailing
considerations"
which
outweigh
the
institutional
interests
in
fair
notice
and
repose.
and,
of
course,
rule
52(b)
talks
about
"fairness,
integrity,
and
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
"
they're
all
different
formulations
of
the
same--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--of
the
same--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here,
justice,
on
that.
the
government
has
been
very
careful
not
to
say
or
urge
you
on
reply...
to
ask.
i
believe
it
was
a
blunder,
and
so
to
adopt--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--a
blunder.
so,
to
adopt
the
government's
rule
is
to
adopt
a
new...
a
new
exclusionary
rule
that
the
defendant
goes
free
when
the
constable
blunders.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
that's
true,
justice.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
well,
the
first
part
of
your
question
was
true,
justice
kennedy,
but
respectfully
the
second
part
was
not.
in
the...
the
way
it
currently
works,
under
the
rules,
a
defendant
must
file
his
notice
of
appeal
before
the
government
files
it.
and
so,
as
it
currently
stands,
he
makes
his
choice
before
he
ever
knows.
there
is
no
extra
burden
that
would
be
placed
on
him.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
that's
exactly
right.
and
the
government
makes
that
point
that
at
some
point,
if
the
government
raises
its
appeal,
he
could
strike
a
deal
with
them.
now,
it's
not
correct
to
assume
that
he
could
then
unilaterally
walk
away
because
there
is
a
notice
of
appeal,
the
government's
notice
of
appeal.
so
he
has
to
strike
a
deal
with
the
government
at
that
point.
that's
no
different
than
in
this
case.
at
oral
argument,
the
eighth
circuit
asked
both
parties
about
this
error.
he
could
have
struck
a
deal
then.
if
this
case
turns
on
notice,
there
isn't
a
notice
problem
here.
it's
all
over
the
record.
it's
raised
at
sentencing.
it's
raised
on
appeal.
it's
discussed
in
the
briefs.
it's
discussed
at
oral
argument.
this
error
was
known
to
all.
now--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--that's
a
critical
difference,
justice
ginsburg.
you're
exactly
right
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
have,
under
3742,
a
notice
of
appeal,
or
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
but
under
the
hypothetical
we
were
discussing,
i
perhaps
assumed
incorrectly.
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
the
defendant
files
his
notice
of
appeal
before
the
government
ever
files;
then
subsequently
the
government
files
as
well.
now,
if
the
defendant
withdraws,
there's
still
a
notice
of
appeal
before
the
court.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
but
if
the
government
had
never
filed,
you're
exactly
right
that
the
defendant
could
take
his
back.
but
the
problem
is
it
doesn't
answer
justice
kennedy's
question.
his
question
was:
isn't
a
defendant
entitled
to
know
that
he's...
that
the
government
might
appeal,
that
he
might
be
at
risk,
that
there
might
be
a
problem
here?
and
my
point
is
he
doesn't
know
under
the
current
system
anyway.
he
has
to
make
his
choice
before
the
government
ever
makes
its
choice.
now--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--right.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
well,
justice
souter,
the
lines
between
a
1,
2,
3,
and
4
are
not
as
bright
as
they
might
be.
but
when
congress
enacted
it,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
of
why
might
congress
have
done
this
when
it
wrote
it,
which
was
before
booker,
which
introduced
some
additional
theory
as
to
which
of
those
four
does
an
appeal
fit
within,
one
was:
is
it
imposed
in
violation
of
law?
and,
using
that
clear
language,
you
can
imagine
the
congress
would
be
concerned
that
violations
of
law
not
go
unremedied.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
and
then
2
is
an
incorrect
application
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
which,
again,
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
were
intended
to
be,
i
believe,
mandatory.
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
indeed.
there
isn't
that
much
of
a
difference
between
1
and
2.
but
then
when
you
get
to
3
and
4,
then
you
get
into
the
language
that
addresses
the
particulars
of
this
case:
was
this
defendant's...
was
the
application
to
this
defendant
too
high
based
on
an
unreasonable
fact
or
to
an
unreasonable
degree,
i
believe
is
the--
mr.

--i
think
that's
right,
justice
souter.
and
i
could
only
say
that
what
we're
doing
here
is
we
are
hypothesizing
why
would
congress
have
said
what
they
said;
and
it
is
a
dangerous
game
to
play.
but
that
is
my
best
hypothesis.
but
it
does
say
what
it
says.
now,
if
i
can
return...
and
i
hope
this
is
helpful...
to
the
questions
that
began
the
entire
argument,
which
is
the
sentencing...
the
sentence
packaging
rule
or
the
sentencing
package
rule
which
justice
breyer
addressed,
i
believe
the
right
answer
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
is
that
under
the
way
the
sentencing
package
rule
works,
which
is
applied,
i
believe,
by
all
circuits,
is
that
if
any
part
of
a--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--that's
a
very
good
question,
justice
scalia.
under
section
3553(a)
after
the
sentencing
reform
act
was
imposed,
judges
were...
district
judges
were
empowered
and
given
the
obligation
to
build
a
sentence
that
took
into
consideration
a
number
of
competeding
factors
such
that
you
might,
if
you
were
a
judge,
a
district
judge,
reduce
a
sentence
under
one
count
of
an
indictment
if
you
were
going
to
give
more
under
another;
and
you
put
together
a
sentencing
package;
and
then
that's
the
sentence
that
the
defendant
receives.
and
then
when
that
goes
up
on
appeal,
if
any
part
of
that
package
is
undone,
the
whole
package
is
undone.
this
is
the
rule
that
the
circuits
follow.
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
they
have
a
precedent
of
this
court
to
fall...
to
base
that
on.
but
it
is
the
rule
that
is
nearly
uniformly
followed.
so
then
when
the
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
is
free
to
construct
a
new
sentence.
so,
as
here,
if
the
defendant
had
prevailed
in
any
way,
then
back
on
remand
the
district
judge
could
have
imposed
the
same
sentence.
now,
a
limit
on
that,
justice
scalia,
is
the
vindictiveness
cases.
that
if
there
is
any
evidence
that
the
increased
sentence,
making
the
sentence
the
same
or
more
is
as
a...
you
know,
it's
a
pay
back--
mr.
jay
t.
jorgensen
--exactly.
and
that
can't
be
done.
but,
otherwise,
with
that
narrow
exception,
the
sentence
can
be
exactly
the
same,
even
though
the
defendant
prevailed
on
appeal.
now,
that
played
out
exactly
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
when
it
went
back
to
the
district
court,
the
defendant
said
to
the
district
court:
don't
give
me
more.
you
can
fit
the
new
fifteen
years
within
what
i
already
have.
give
me
what
i
already
have.
and
the
district
judge
said:
no.
i'm
going
to
give
you
more.
now,
the
answer
clearly,
i
think,
cannot
turn
on
the
fact
that
the
seventh...
excuse
me...
the
eighth
circuit
knew
the
answer.
we
had
some
questions
about
what
if
the
eighth
circuit
said:
well,
i
see
an
error
here,
but
i
don't
know
how
it
affects
your
sentence,
so
i
am
sending
you
back.
would
that
be
okay?
but
it
can't
turn
on
the...
that
the
seventh
circuit
knew
in
this
instance
that
he
would
get
an
increased
sentence
as
versus
it
would
be
okay
to
send
it
back
without
saying
what
the
effect
would
be
for
the
district
judge
to
impose.
and,
justice
kennedy,
your
question
was:
what
happens
if
there's
a
new
trial?
as
my
children
would
say,
it
is
a
complete
do-over.
when
the
trial
starts
all
over
again,
new
facts
are
found
or
not
found,
and
the
sentence
is
completely
constructed
all
over
again
based
on
the
facts
as
found
by
the
jury
in
the
second
trial.
if
i
can
end,
justices,
i
would
end
by
saying
that
i
believe
section
3742
does
provide
the
answer
here.
congress
provided
a
clean
break
with
the
past.
the
idea
that
congress
was
aware
of
a
clear
rule
that
they
would
have
followed,
i
think,
is
contradicted
by
reynolds,
where
this
court
did
the
opposite;
langnes,
where
this
court
said
that
the
cross-appeal
rule
was
a
rule
of
practice,
not
a
jurisdictional
limit;
and
the
confusion
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
believe
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
on
whether
it
is
well-established
is
that
in
the
civil
context
i
believe
the
d.c.
third,
fourth,
eighth,
and
ninth
circuits
say
that
this
is
a
rule
of
practice
while
the
senate
has
debated
it
back
and
forth.
and
in
neztsosie
the
court
noted
this
confusion
and
noted,
indeed,
that
some
of
the
circuits
are
internally
inconsistent
as
to
what
the
rule
is.
it
is
slightly
different
in
the
criminal
context.
i
believe
the
eighth
and
the
tenth
circuits
have
not
followed...
have
not
followed
the
rule,
while
the
second,
third,
fourth
and
seventh
have;
and
the
fifth
is
internally
inconsistent.
i
may...
i
may
have
some
error,
honestly,
in
that
recitation.
i
did
it
from
memory
when
you
asked.
but
my
point,
i
think,
comes
through
no
matter
what,
which
is:
how
could
congress
have
assumed
this
is
a
clear
rule
and,
when
we
write
these
words,
the
courts
will
know
that's
what
we
mean,
when
there's
all
this
confusion
amongst
the
courts?
thank
you,
your
honors.
