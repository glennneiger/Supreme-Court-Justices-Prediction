where
does
it
say
that
(a)(1)
is
available
only
against
the
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
own
argument
was
that
(a)(3)
is
the
catchall.
so
if
(a)(2),
which
is
described
as
very
precise,
if
that's
applicable,
you
would
not
get
to
(a)(3).
you
would
be
asking
us
at
this
point
to
assume
that
somehow
the
(a)(2)
case
folds,
and
then
we
flip
over
into
(a)(3).
but
why
should
we
get
there
prematurely?
it
seems
to
me
if
it's
right
that
(a)(2)
comes
before
(a)(3),
it
isn't...
it's
not
quite
a
ripeness
issue,
but
it's
close
to
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
would
you
clarify
what
the
government's
position
is
on
this
(a)(1)(b)
argument?
are
you
saying
it
is
available,
but
(a)(2)
is
available?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
now
we
know
what
benefits
would
be
due
because
he
has
withdrawn,
but
when
he
made
this
complaint
and
he
hadn't
been
withdrawn,
he
could
have
made
an
unwise
investment
the
next
time.
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
russell
was
about
a
welfare
plan,
not
a
pension...
and
as
i
recall,
the
plaintiff
in
russell
was
seeking
medical
benefits
that
she
didn't
get
and
she
wanted,
not
the
benefits
because
she
did
get
those,
she
wanted
straight
out
damages,
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
for
delay
in
the
receipt
of
benefits.
that's
quite
a
different
thing
from
saying
i
want
the
contributions
made
so
that
i
will
get
the
benefits
to
which
i'm
entitled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
you
would
agree
that
(a)(1)(b)
is
not
available?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
the
plan
other
than
a
collection
of
individual...
i
mean
the
trustee
is
the
trustee
for
the
plan.
all
of
the
assets
are
there.
the
individuals
do
not
have
them
in
their
pockets.
so
the
trustee
is
managing
this
fund,
which
is
then
segmented
into
accounts
for
each
individual.
so
i
think
your...
your
suggestion
is
that
these
defined
contribution
plans,
they
come
out
entirely
because...
because
of
the
segmented
accounts.
so
you
could
never
bring
a
claim
because
it
would
always
be
an
individual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
said...
you
said
it
doesn't
have
to
be
every
single
member
of
the
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
it
has
to
be
more
than
one.
how
then
do
we
read
the
statute
to
say,
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
plan
as
a
whole
because
there
may
be
some
people
that
are
not
entitled
to
this?
how
do
we
get
that
number
between
more
than
one
and
less
than
everybody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm...
i'm
asking
you
just...
in
your...
you
have
said,
you
conceded,
that
to
bring
the
suit
against
the
trustee,
it
doesn't
have
to
involve
every
member,
every
contributor
to
this
defined
contribution
plan.
but
it
has
to
involve--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--more
than
one.
so
that's
the
question
i'd
like
to
you
address.
you
recognize
that
there
can
be
a
claim
against
the
fiduciary
for
breach
of
trust
on
behalf
of
contributors
to
the
plan?
so
in
that
lawsuit,
how
many
people
would
there
have
to
be
to
qualify?
you
say
not
everybody,
but
more
than
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
example.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what?
what
other
remedies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
this
isn't...
you
said
it
isn't
a
claim
for
benefits.
it's
a
clam
for
lost
profits.
you
said
that
a
few
times.
i
thought
(a)(1)(b)
is
a
claim
for
benefits,
current
or
future.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know,
because
in
making
this,
hitching
your
wagon
to
the
(a)(1)(b)...
i
thought
you
were
arguing...
what
did
you
say
the
remedy
for
this
person
would
be?
assuming
it's
true
that
he
put
in
his
slip
and
he
said
invest
in
x
set
of
mutual
funds
and
the
trustee
missed
it,
lost
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
his
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
what
you
argue
in
your
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
did
you
argue
is
his
remedy,
in
your
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
that
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't
know
until
he
got
the
report.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
much
too
late.
it's
over
and
done.
it
wasn't
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take,
because
this
case
was
tossed
out
on
the
pleadings,
the...
there
are
forms
to
fill
out
and
says
i
want
this
set
of
investments
as
opposed
to
that
set
of
investments.
the
contributor
fills
out
that
form,
gives
it
to
the
fiduciary.
a
careless
employee
for
the
fiduciary
loses
it,
and
that's
the
story.
so
what's
the
remedy
for
the
contributor
who
gave
his
instruction
that
weren't
followed,
not
out
of
anything
deliberate
but
just
carelessness?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
enjoining
him
to
be
careless?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
say
i
want
these
funds
invested
in
this
particular
set
of
shares
for
this
period,
for
this
six-month
period,
then
two
years
later
you
can
have
that
trade
made?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
never
available
in
a
court
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
what
is
it?
it's
got
to
be
something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
isn't
like
a
cleanup.
