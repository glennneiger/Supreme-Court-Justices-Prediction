wouldn't
the
theory
be
that
if
ultimately
the
other
accounts
could
be
robbed
to
sort
of
make
up
for
at
least
part
of
the
loss
of
this
one,
that
for
a
loss
to
any
account
is
a
threat
to
all
the
others?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
is
an
oddity
but
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
roberts'
argument
that
the
only
recovery
under
(a)(1)(b)
is
against
the
plan,
and
the
plan
doesn't
have
the
money
in
the
account
so
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
any
relief
it's
got
to
come
from
the
fiduciary
and
that
gets
you
into
(2).
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
we've
got
to
assume
at
this
point
that
we've...
we've
got
a...
a
section
(2)
claim
before
us
and
the
argument
simply
is,
is
that
in
effect
to
be
disallowed
because
it
should
have
been
an
(a)(1)(b)
claim?
and
the
argument
that
the
united
states
has
made,
the
argument
that
the
other
side
has
made
is,
we
cannot
get
to
any
money
under
(a)(1)(b).
we've
got
to
get
that
from
the
fiduciary
and
we
can
only
do
that
under
(2).
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
argument
of
the
united
states
is
you
can't
rob
peter
to
pay
paul,
so
that
if
in
fact
his
account
didn't
have
the
money,
the
plan
didn't
have
any
place
to
get
the
money,
and
the
only
way
the
money
could
be
had
would
have
been
from
a
fiduciary,
which
again
gets
you
to
subsection
(2).
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
answering
a
different
question
in
that
response.
the
argument
here
is
basically
an
argument
between
the
possibility...
an
argument
based
on
the
claim
that
under
(a)(1)(b)
you
can't
go
against
the
fiduciary.
the
only
way
you
can
get
the
money
is
from
a
fiduciary
and
therefore
(a)(1)(b)
would
have
been
of
no
value
to
you.
do
you...
do
you
take
issue
with
that
premise?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
then
doesn't
that
leave
you
in
the
position
of
having
to
say
that
you've
either
got
to
bring
the
claim
under
(a)(1)(b),
or
you've
got...
subsection
(2)...
or
you've
got
to
bring
it
under
subsection
(3)?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
answer,
if
the
premise
you
have
just
agreed
to
is
correct,
will
be,
"you
bet.
"
"he
is
entitled
to
have
another
$150,000
in
his
account
for
the
benefit
of
future
payments
to
him.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
"but
we
haven't
got
the
money
and
we
can't
rob
peter
to
pay
paul
and
therefore
we
are
very
sorry,
go
away.
"
that
would
necessarily
be
the
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
going
to
the...
it
seems
to...
with
respect,
i
think
that's
going
to
the
merits.
and
the
question
is,
if
you
can
recover
against
anybody,
the
claim
is,
the
argument
is
you're
going
to
get
nowhere
under
(a)(1)(b)
because
the
plan
can't
help
you
by
itself.
the
only
way
you
can
get
any
value
from
your
lawsuit
is
by
going
against
the
fiduciary.
maybe
you
have
good
reasons
to
defend
that,
but
if
you're
going
to
have
a
suit
against
anyone,
it's
got
to
be
under
subsection
(2).
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they're
saying
they
are
careful
and
interrelated
provisions
mean
that
you
got
to
go
under
subsection
(2).
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
i
think
saying,
we...
we
agree
with
you
that
ultimately
(1)(b)
couldn't
get
you
any
relief
because
the
fiduciary...
the
plan
doesn't
have
any
money.
and
you're
now
arguing,
well,
if
you
go
against
the
fiduciary,
ultimately
we
have
a
good
defense
to
that.
but
the
fact
is,
the
question
before
us
is
whom
do
you
sue
and
under
what...
under
what
section?
and
i
think
your
own
logic
forces
you
to
say
that...
that
has
got
to
be
subsection
(2).
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
hasn't
been
reached
yet,
has
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
arguing
that
ultimately
he
couldn't
prove
damages.
we're
talking
about
allegations
at
the
pleading
stage.
let
me
ask
you
a
slightly
different
question.
you
said
there's
no...
there's
no,
as
justice
scalia
put
it,
there's
no
slush
fund;
there's
no
pooled
assets
here.
all
the
assets
are
assets
which
are
accounted
for,
attributable
to,
individual
accounts.
therefore
there
can
be
no...
there
can
be
no
loss
to
the
plan
which
is
not
a
loss
to
an
individual
account,
can
there
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
is
your
theory
on
how
we
determine
whether
a
loss
to
the
plan
from
an
individual
account
suffices
as
a
loss
to
the
plan
for
purposes
of
pleading?
has
it
got
to
be,
you
know,
500
losses
out
of
1000?
i
don't
see
why
that
should
make
a
difference.
i'm
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
why
doesn't
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there's
something
i'm
not
understanding
about
your
argument.
when
you
say
the
nature
of
the
fiduciary
breach
pleaded
is
what
makes
the
difference,
i
am
understanding
you
to
be
answering
the
question
whether
on
the
merits
ultimately
there
will
be
a...
they
will
be
able
to
make
out
a
claim.
and
i
am
saying,
as
i
said
once
before,
that
that
seems
to
me
a
question
that
comes
after
you
answer
the
question
before
us.
and
the
question
before
us
is
not
whether
ultimately
you've
stated
a
winning
claim,
but
whether
ultimately...
whether
right
now
you
have
stated
a
claim
for
a
loss
to
the
plan.
now,
that
is
not
your
view.
why
is
it
that
i
am
taking
your
answer
to
be
an
answer
on
the
merits
to
a
different
question
and
you're
saying
my
answer,
i.e.,
nature
of
duty
breached
or...
is
one
that
goes
to
the
question
of
pleading
at
this
stage?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
do
that
in
two
accounts
is
that
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it...
if
it
is
the...
and
i
still
don't
get
this,
but
if
it
is
the
nature
of
the
particular
dereliction
in
duty
that
counts,
why
do
we
need
more
than
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
an
individualistic
kind
of
breach
when
it
is
viewed
as...
as
only
one
account,
but
it
is
a
breach
against
the
plan
when
it
is
understood
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
plan
except
an
aggregation
of
accounts.
you
can't
have
a
breach
against
one
without
a
breach
against
the
plan.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why,
if
that
is
your
answer,
why
does
it
matter
what
the
nature
of
the
dereliction
is?
because
you're...
you're
saying
the...
the
really
important
question
is
the
nature
of
the
dereliction.
if
it
is,
then
i
don't
see
why
the
multiple
of
the
number
of
accounts
affected
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
then
you've
got
a
lot
of
plaintiffs
but
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be
close
to
the
way
you
read
it,
but
why
is
your
reading
correct?
why
should
that
make
any
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
will...
which
will
get
him
nothing.
