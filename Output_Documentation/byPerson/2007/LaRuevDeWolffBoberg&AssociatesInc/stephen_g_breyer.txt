stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why?
why?
that's
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
case.
i
mean...
imaginary
example...
a
plan,
a
thousand
members.
the
trustee
invests
in
a
thousand
diamonds.
he
puts
it
in
a
bank
deposit
vault.
one
day
he
takes
all
500
diamonds
and
runs
off
to
martinique.
we
catch
him
enjoying
the
sun.
we
can
sue
him
under
(2),
right?
that's
what
(2)
is
there
for,
right?
right.
okay.
now,
everything
is
the
same
except
each
of
the
thousand
diamonds
was
put
in
individual
safe
deposit
box
with
the
participant's
name
on
it.
everything
else
is
the
same.
why
should
it
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
interested
in
that
question.
i'm
interested
in
my
question.
why
isn't
it
available
under
(a)(2)?
in
both
cases,
the
trustee
took
500
diamonds
that
belonged
to
the
plan
and
went
to
martinique.
now,
if
you
can
sue
him
when
the
plans
are
all
put
in
one
big
safe
deposit
box
with
the
diamonds,
why
can't
you
sue
him
when
they're
put
in
500
small
safe
deposit
boxes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
go
back
to
amend
my
example.
he
only
took
one
diamond.
it
was
a
big
vault
he
took
it
from...
one
diamond.
you
still
have
the
claim,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
big
vault.
he
took
it
from
one
big
safe
deposit
box...
one
diamond.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
this
is
just
there
in
the
big
vault.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course.
well...
no,
no.
i'm
going
to,
of
course,
ask
you,
since
you
seem
to
be
turning
this
thing
on
how
individualized
this
loss
was,
well,
it
was
just
one
diamond,
out
of
thousand.
now
obviously
i'm
going
to
ask
you,
because
i
haven't
yet
heard
the
answer...
at
least
i
didn't
seem
to
hear
it...
what
the
difference
is
whether
that
one
diamond
came
from
a
big
vault
or
from
one
little
safe
deposit
box
with
the
participant's
label
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
the
same
kind
of
loss.
and
what
we
have
here
is
the
footnote
that
was
alleged
in...
written
in
the
opinion...
we
assume
the
defendant's
conduct
amounted
to
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duties.
so
therefore
all
of
the
discussion
you
have,
that
maybe
it
didn't...
well,
maybe
you're
right.
but
we
better
send
it
back
so
that
they
can
decide
that
question.
and
i
just
don't
see
what
the
other
difference
is.
it
can't
be
a
difference
in
the
size
of
the
diamond.
and
people
are
saying,
well,
why...
well,
you
see
the
question.
