mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
erisa
authorizes
a
participant
in
a
defined
contribution
plan
to
sue
to
recover
losses
to
the
plan
caused
by
a
fiduciary
breach
even
if
the
losses
are
attributable
to
the
participant's
individual
plan
account.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's...
that's
theoretically
possible
because
the
loss
to
the...
loss
to
this
individual
account
is
a
loss
to
the
plan.
although
it's
unlikely
that
a
participant
that
has
no...
that
is...
whose
own
benefits
are
not
going
to
be
affected
has
much
incentive
to
sue,
and
it's
also
possible
that
a
court
might
conclude
if
such
a
participant
did
bring
suit,
that
such
a
suit
shouldn't
proceed
under
prudential
standing
principles
or
because
the
suit
wouldn't
be
appropriate,
but
here--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
we
agree
that
a
loss
to
any
account
is
a
threat
to
the
plan
as
a
whole,
but
i
think
for
a
different
reason.
we
don't
think
that
you
could
rob
the
other
accounts
to
pay
this...
this
participant.
that
would
likely
violate
the
fiduciary's
duty
of
loyalty
to
those
participants,
the
fiduciary
duty
of
prudence
under...
under
erisa.
it
would
also
probably
violate
the
terms
of
the
plan,
because
they
have
a
right
to
future
benefits
by
the
amount
that's
in
their
allocation
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
implication
is
that
the
suit
is
against
the
plan
or
against
a
fiduciary
in...
under
(a)(1)(b).
against
the
plan
or
against
the
fiduciary
whose
initial
capacity
is
representative
of
the
plan.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
you
can't
sue
the
fiduciary
under
(a)(1)(b),
that
just
reinforces
the
point
even...
even
more,
your
honor,
that
petitioner's
cause
of
action
here
arises
under
(a)(2)
because
he
is
seeking
relief
for
the
plan
not
relief
from
the
plan.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
under
(a)(1)(b),
most
courts
require
that
the
suit
be
brought
against
the
plan.
i
think
the
suit
in
certain
circumstances
could
be
brought
against
the
fiduciary
to
require
the
fiduciary
to
take
action
that
is
required
by
the
terms
of
the
plan
such
as
if
you
fought
against
the
fiduciary
to
pay
benefits
out.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and
if
it's
not
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duties,
petitioner
will
lose
on
the
merits
or
on
remand
in
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on
facts
that
could
be
decided.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
both
of
a
failure
to
follow
the
terms
of
the
plan
and
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
prudence,
because
when
a
plan
provides
that
participants
can
direct
their
investments--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
case
was
dismissed
on
the
pleadings,
your
honor,
and
it
alleges
that
there
was
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
and
respondent
hasn't
disputed,
in
fact,
that
the
plan
requires
participants...
allows
participants
direct,
in
fact--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
but
the
inferences
shouldn't
be
construed
against
the
plaintiff
in
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
pleadings,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
that,
respondent's
answer...
this
is
on
page
2a
of
the
red
brief...
admitted
that
participants
in
the
dewolff
plan
are
permitted
to
direct
the
investment
of
their
contributions
to
the
plan.
that's
in
paragraph
eight
on
page
2a.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
certainly
true,
your
honor.
but
here,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
there
was
a
fiduciary
breach.
that's
on
page
3a
in
the
star
footnote
of
the...
it's
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
second-guess
that,
particularly
since
respondent
didn't
argue
in
its
motion
to
dismiss
that
there
was
no
fiduciary
breach
here.
so
the
case
comes
to
the
court
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
fiduciary
breach.
and
these
are
very
important
questions
concerning
whether
assuming
there
is
a
fiduciary
breach,
a
participant
in
a
defined
contribution
plan
can
sue
to
recover
for
the
plan
the
losses
to
the
plan
that
are
caused
by
that
breach
when
the
losses
are
attributable
only
to
that
individual's
account.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
don't
think
that
there
is
a
claim
at
this
point
under
(a)(1)(b),
because
the...
the
money
the
petitioner
seeks...
what's
happened
here
is
he
has
alleged
that
there
has
been
a
fiduciary
breach
that
caused
a
loss
to
the
plan.
the
appropriate
remedy
for
that
is
a
recovery
from
the
fiduciary
in
its
personal
capacity
to
put
the
money
back
in
the
plan.
that's
what
section
502(a)(2)
provides.
once
the
money
is
back
in
the
plan
and
then
it's
allocated
pursuant
to
the
duty
of
prudence
to
the
petitioner's
account,
then
if
the
plan
didn't
pay
out
the
money
to
him
when
he
was
entitled
to
it,
which
he
appears
to
be
entitled
to
it
now
since
he
has
withdrawn
his
account
balance,
he
would
have
a
502
(a)(2)
claim...
a
502(a)(1)(b)
claim,
excuse
me...
but
he
doesn't
have
a
claim
under
that
provision
now.
we...
at
least
we
think
it's
very
unlikely
that
he
does,
because
generally
plans
provide
that
the
benefits
that
are
owed
to
people
are
the
money
that
are
in...
in
the
account.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
right,
and
then
he
would...
it
would
be
even
clearer,
i
think
that
he
has
no
(a)(1)(b)
claim,
if
he
didn't
have...
say
he
was
still
participating
in
the
plan
and
he
wasn't...
he
hadn't
withdrawn
his
account
balance
and
didn't
have
a
right
to
withdraw
his
account
balance
at
that
time,
then
he
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
any
benefits
from
the
plan.
the
crux
of
the
matter
here
is
that
the
plan
has
suffered
a
loss
and
that
the
appropriate
remedy
is
against
the
fiduciary
in
his
personal
capacity;
(a)(1)(b)
doesn't
provide
for
suits
against
the
fiduciary
in
his
personal
capacity
to
recover
money
for
the
plan.
it
provides,
again,
suits
against
the
plan
to
pay
money
out
of
the
plan.
this
money
isn't
in
the
plan;
it
can't
paid
from
the
accounts
of
other
participants
because
it
would
breach
these
duties
under
erisa.
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
get
the
money
back
in
the
plan.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
because
(a)(1)(b)
provides
an
action
for
benefits
from
the
plan
and
(a)(2)
provides
an
action
against...
it's
a
different...
against
a
different
defendant
for
a
different
kind
of
claim.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
it's
a
claim
for
benefits
under
(a)(1)
or
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan,
such
as
if
the
fiduciary
says,
"i'm
just
not
going
to
follow
your
instruction.
"
and
the
participant
wants
a
clarification
of
that
and
an
order
compelling
the
fiduciary
in
his
official
capacity
to
do
that,
yes,
that
would
be
a
suit
under
(a)(1)(b)
and
there
would
be
no
suit
under
(a)(2).
there's
only
a
suit
under
(a)(2)
if
there
are
losses
to
the
plan
and
if
the
remedy
is
to
put
the
money
back
in
the
plan
by
getting
it
from
the
breaching
fiduciary.
if
i
could
turn
to
(a)(3)
just
very
briefly,
your
honor.
we
think
that
suits
against
fiduciaries
to
recover
losses
by
fiduciary
breaches
are
also
authorized
by
section
502(a)(3),
which
provides
for
appropriate
action,
i
believe.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
that's
1132(a)(3).
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
of
the
united
states
code,
29
u.s.c.
1132.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
okay.
i
apologize.
that...
that
provision...
my
time.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
provision
provides
for
appropriate
equitable
relief,
and
a
suit
against
a
fiduciary
to
recover
losses
caused
by
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
seeks
equitable
relief
because
it's
analogous
to
an
action
for
breach
of
trust
seeking
the
equitable
remedy
of
surcharge.
thank
you.
