chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
06-856,
larue
v.
dewolff,
boberg
&
associates.
mr.
stris.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
plan
itself
is
nowhere
in
the
record,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
the
summary.
and
i
looked
at
the
summary
and
saw
nowhere
the
rules
about
investment
options,
what
you
get
to
choose,
how
often...
and
for
all
we
know,
the
plan
might
say
you
have
no
choice
about
investment
options,
it's
all
going
to
be
invested
in
t-bills
or
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
in
the
record
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that's
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari,
and
i
don't
believe
that's
in
the
record.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
that's
the
summary
of
the
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
summary
on
the
page
you
mentioned
says
that
you
will
be
able
to...
you
have
certain
investment
choices
are
available
to
you,
and
that
the
administrator
will
provide
you
with
information
on
what
they
are
and
how
you
can
change
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
don't
know
those
details,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
also
presumably
more
obviously
constitute
a
breach
of
the
plan,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
position
is
anything
that
is
remediable,
if
that's
a
word,
under
(a)(1)
can
also
be
pursued
under
(a)(2)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
me
step
back.
do
you
agree
that
you
could
bring
an
action
under
(a)(1)
for
this
breach
of
the
plan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
approach,
if
can
you
go
under
(a)(2)...
you're
right
that
we
judicially
have
developed
a
number
of
glosses
on
(a)(1),
including
i
think
most
importantly
the
firestone
deference
principle.
but
if
you're
right
that
you
can
go
under
(a)(2),
then
all
of
that
work
has
been
in
vain.
you
can
avoid
all
the
limitations
on
(a)(1)
just
by
saying
we
want
the
same
relief
under
(a)(2).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
told
me
earlier
that
any
breach
of
the
plan
was
a
fiduciary
duty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
you're...
the...
what
is
it...
the
obverse
or
the
converse
of
that
you're
saying
is
not
true.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i...
i'm
not
sure
about
your
characterization
that
he
would
pick
the
pockets
of
the
other
plan
participants.
by
definition
he
only
prevails
if
this
was
a
benefit
to
which
he
was
entitled
under
the
plan.
so
that
doesn't
seem
unfair
to
the
other
plan
participants.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
may
or
may
not
have
the
money.
you
could
have
failed
to
follow
his
instructions
in
a
way
that
enriched
the
plan,
and
it's
simply
a
question
of
getting
that
money
properly
allocated
rather
than
improperly
allocated
to
the
other
plan
participants
who
are
picking
the
pocket
of
your
client.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stris.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
means
every
participant,
right?
in
other
words,
for
the
failure
of
the
plan
to
follow
this
individual's
instructions,
any
participant
in
the
plan
can
bring
suit
under
(a)(2)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
know
that
this
is
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
under
(a)(2)
without
having
the
plan
before
us?
in
other
words,
it
may
not
be
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
follow
an
instruction
from
somebody
if
the
plan
provides
a
different
way
in
which
those
instructions
are
going
to
be
handled.
i'd
say,
as
i
think
a
lot
of
these
plans
do,
you
can
change
your
investment
options
only
during
a
particular
period.
well,
if
the
instruction
came
at
a
different
time,
it
wouldn't
be
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duties
because
it
wasn't
a
breach
of
the
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought
his
argument...
his
argument
reduces
to
the
fact
that
it's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
because
it's
a
breach
of
the
plan.
but
if
not
a
breach
of
the
plan,
then
it's
not
a
breach--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
we
need
to
know...
we
need
to
know
what
the
plan
provides
before
we
can
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
pleadings
don't
include
the
plan.
so
we
have
to
assess
the
pleadings
without
the
terms
of
the
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
don't
know
under
what
terms.
i
mean
i've
seen
plans
where
you
are
entitled
to
direct,
but
that's
subject
to
conditions
and
limitations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
if
it
is
within
(a)(1)(b)
that
it's
therefore
not
within
(a)(2)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
your
answer
would
be
yes.
in
other
words,
if
it's
in
(a)(1),
it's
not
in
(a)(2).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
gies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
there
is
a
suit
under
(a)(1)(b)
for
a
breach
of
the
plan
by
a
fiduciary,
do
you
agree
that
the
plan,
if
it's
liable,
could
then
sue
the
fiduciary?
i
realize
i'm
talking
about
a
suit
by
one
of
your
clients
against
the
other,
but
would
that
be
a
feasible
result
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
view
it
as
a
lost
profits
claim.
would
your
position
be
different
if
he
directed
a
sale
of
the
stock
and
then
the
stock
went
down
30
points
instead
of
going
up?
that's
not
lost
profits.
that's
avoiding
losses
to
the
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gies.
the
case
is
submitted.
