mr.
peter
k.
stris
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
the
first
question
on
which
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
sections
502(a)(2)
and
409
of
erisa
permit
restoration
of
"any
losses
to
the
plan".
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
never
thought
the
day
would
come,
justice
scalia,
when
i
was
described
as
working
with
erisa
all
of
the
time,
but
i
will
tell
you
the
code
provision.
the
code
provision
is...
for
502(a)(2)
of
erisa...
is
29
u.s.c.
1132(a)(2).
it's
found
on
page
10a
of
the
blue
brief.
section
409
of
erisa
is
u.s.c.
1109,
and
i
was
quoting
specifically
from
1109(a),
and
that
is
found
on
page
9a
of
the
blue
brief.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
now,
the
statute
plainly
states
that
"any
losses
to
the
plan"
may
be
recovered
if
they
were
caused
by
fiduciary
breach.
our
position
on
the
(a)(2)
question
is
straightforward.
the
plain
meaning
of
"any
losses
to
the
plan"
includes
any
diminution
in
value
of
defined
contribution
plan
assets,
regardless
of
the
number
of
participants
ultimately
affected.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
the
summary
plan
description
was
attached
to
the
complaint.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
respectfully,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
not
true.
i
would
point
your
attention
to
page
19a
of
the
appendix
to
the
brief
in
opposition.
and
this
is
the
page
of
the
summary
plan
description
that
makes
clear
that
participants
in
the
plan
like
mr.
larue
will
have
the
opportunity
to
direct
their
investments.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
yes.
and
to
be
clear,
justice
scalia--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--it
is
page
19a
of
the--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--it
is
in
the
record;
it
was
attached
to
the
complaint
that
was
filed
by
mr.
larue
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
the
summary
plan
description,
that's
correct.
and
as
you
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
summary
plan
description
and
the
plan,
the
summary
plan
description
governs;
it's
a
legitimate
document.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that's
true,
but
this
case
was
decided
at
the
pleading
stage.
and
so
to
be
clear,
we
alleged
that
the
right
given
to
mr.
larue
under
the
plan
was
violated.
if
true,
then
that
would
constitute
a
fiduciary
breach.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
yes,
that's
correct;
and
that
is
a
fiduciary
breach.
under
404
(a)(1)(d),
failure
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
plan
is
a
classic
example
of
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
no,
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
think
that's
far
from
clear,
but
what
is
clear
is
that
we
could
not
recover
what
we
wanted
under
(a)(1).
(a)(1)
only
permits
a
lawsuit
against
the
plan.
here
the
plan
doesn't
have
the
funds
that
are
relevant.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
the
specific
language
of
(a)(1)
doesn't
state
that.
it
states
that
you
can
get
benefits
due
under
the
plan,
or
you
can
enforce
your
rights
under
the
plan.
i'm
not
aware
of
a
single
case,
justice
ginsburg,
where
an
(a)(1)(b)
action
has
been
permitted
to
recover
personally
from
a
fiduciary.
that
is
the
purpose
of
(a)(2),
which
specifically
states
that
you
can
personally
recover
from
a
fiduciary.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
think
the
answer
to
that...
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
that's
incorrect.
and
the
first
reason
is
502
(a)(2),
unlike
502(a)(3),
is
not
a
catchall
provision,
so
if
he
has
a
remedy
under
502(a)(2)--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--right.
and
it
is...
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
that
provision
is
mutually
exclusive
with
another
provision.
so
my
first
response
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
is
that
even
if
he
could
have
proceeded
under
(a)(1)(b),
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
he
had
to,
if
he
wanted
to
proceed
under
the
express
terms
of
(a)(2).
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
what
i
would
say
to
that,
justice
scalia,
and
is
that
this
administrative
exhaustion
requirement
that
you're
referring
to
is
a
judicial
gloss
on
the
statute.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
express
terms
of
(a)(2),
which
the
plain
language
authorizes
restoration
to
the
plan
of
any
losses
to
the
plan
for
any
breach
of
duty--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
would
not
agree
with
that
characterization
because
there
are
very
few
cases
where
the
specific
conditions
for
(a)(2)
are
met.
you
would
need
to
prove
a
loss
to
the
plan.
in
welfare
plan
cases,
for
example,
you
would
not
be
able
to
proceed
under
(a)(2)
because
you
would
never
be
able
to
show
that
the
fiduciary
breach
caused
a
loss
to
the
plan.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
no,
that's
not
true.
there
are
two
requirements
for
an
(a)(2)
action.
one
is
that
there
be
a
fiduciary
breach.
that's
what
you
just
spoke
to
when
you
referred
to
a
breach
of
the
term
of
the
plan.
but
there's
a
second
important
requirement
which
goes
to
the
heart
of
why
(a)(2)
is
what
it
is.
there
must
be
a
loss
to
the
plan.
this
court
recognizes--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
don't
read
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
that
way.
i
read
it
as...
as
dicta,
not
an
alternative
holding.
and
to
be
clear,
the
respondents
concede
that
point
on
page
5
of
their
brief
in
opposition,
and
i
quote.
they
state:
"after
suggesting
this
claim
may
have
been
waived.
"
and
then
they
proceed.
so
even
respondent
agrees
that
it
was
merely
dicta--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--not
in
my
opinion,
but
that's
an
issue
that
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
lower
courts
will
need
to
resolve.
if
they
interpret
their
opinion
as
having
held
that,
certainly
we
would
be
precluded.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
they
held,
and
i
think
we
have
a
very
strong
argument
that
we
pled
a
502(a)(2)
claim
as
required
under
the
federal
rules.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
yes.
that
is
a
classic
action
under
(a)(1)(b),
your
honor.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
no.
i
don't
agree
with
that
characterization.
in
a
defined
benefit
plan
of
which
a
welfare
plan
is
the
classic
example--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--there
are
no
assets
that
you
have
an
entitlement
to
as
a
beneficiary.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
that's...
you
have
entitlement
to
a
contractually
provided
benefit.
so,
if
there
is
a
fiduciary
breach
in
terms
of
the
administrator
stating,
"we're
not
going
to
give
you
this
cancer
treatment
that
really
was
provided
under
plan--
"
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--or,
"we're
not
going
to
give
you
this
drug--
"
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that
breach
doesn't
cause
any
diminution
in
value
in
plan
assets.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
with
respect,
i
think
that
that
is...
that's
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
the
argument
that
you
made
is
that
a
loss
occurs
if
your
fiduciary
duty
claim
is
successful.
that's
another
statute.
that's--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--let
me
take
a
step
back
because
i
think
we
are
100
percent
in
agreement,
but
i
want
to
be
clear
what
our
position
is.
under
the
factual
scenario
that
you
described,
i
agree
with
you
100
percent
that
you
would
need
to
proceed
under
(a)(1)(b),
because
you
would
be
requesting
a
benefit
that
you
are
entitled
to
under
the
plan.
in
this
case,
the
only
benefit
that
you
are
entitled
to,
if
you
are
a
participant
in
an
individual
account
plan,
is
the
value
of
the
contributions
that
you've
put
or
your
employer
has
put
into
the
account,
as
they
have
either
appreciated
or
depreciated.
so
my
first
response...
it's
actually
the
second
response
i
was
going
to
give
earlier
that
i
never
got
to
is
that
i
believe
that
it's
not
clear
that
there
is
even
a
legitimate
(a)(1)(b)
claim
that
mr.
larue
could
have
asserted
here
because--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
and
then
one
of
two
things
at
that
point
would
happen,
justice
scalia.
either
he
would
get
paid
by
the
plan,
which
would
pick
the
pockets
of
the
other
participants
and
require
the
plan
to
then
bring
an
action
under
(a)(2)--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--which
is
perfectly
legitimate,
but
my
response
to
that
is
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute
to
suggest
that
that
is
required.
if
he
has
an
action
to
do
that
directly
under
(a)(2),
there's
no
language
in
the
statute
to
suggest
that
he
need
bring
an
(a)(1)
action
first
and
require
the
plan
to
then
proceed
under
(a)(2).
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
a
defined
contribution
plan
is
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
assets
that
have
been
allocated
to
a
group
of
participants.
so,
if
those
assets
are
depleted
through
fiduciary
breach,
which
is
what
occurred
here,
and
you
bring
a
claim
saying
that
your
interest
in
the
plan
was
depleted,
if
you
brought
that
claim
against
the
plan,
the
plan
no
longer
has
the
money.
so
either
they
can
pay
you--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--well,
i
think
under
the
example
that
you
just
gave,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
would
not
be
a
loss
to
the
plan.
our
fundamental
argument
about
the
plain
text
of
this
statute
is
that
a
loss
to
the
plan
is
a
diminution
in
plan
assets.
if
i'm
a
participant
in
a
plan,
and
the
administrator
doesn't
like
me
and
takes
my
money
and
allocates
it,
just
because
they
feel
like
it,
to
another
participant
in
the
plan,
it
is
not
our
position
that
there
would
be
a
claim
under
(a)(2)
because
there
has
been
no
diminution
in
plan
assets.
one
would
need
to
proceed
under
(a)(3).
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
first,
it
may
end
up
the
same
way
depending
on
how
the
facts
play
out,
which
is
the
perfect
evidence
for
my
point,
which
is
502(a)(3)
of
erisa
has
been
interpreted
as
a
catchall
provision.
502(a)(2)
is
anything
but.
it
sets
forth
very
specific
conditions
and
very
specific
relief
that
is
available
if
those
conditions
are
met.
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
availability
of
a
potential
remedy
under
(a)(1)
precludes
a
remedy
under
(a)(2).
now,
my
second
response,
justice
scalia,
is
that
depending
on
how
the
facts
play
out,
the
result
may
not
be
as
you
suggest.
the
plan
may
choose
not
to
go
after
the
fiduciary,
and
if
that's
the
case,
all...
at
most
my
client
could
get
is
a
declaration
under
(a)(1)
that
doesn't
ultimately
get
him
any
money.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
think
that
that--
mr.
peter
k.
stris
--i
think
in
an
individual
account
plan,
that
presents
a
very
difficult
question.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
think
probably
he
would
not
be
able
to
recover
that
money.
i
think
that
money
would
be
lost
and
he
would
have
no
remedy
because,
at
that
point
in
time,
someone
is
going
to
lose.
either
my
client
is
not
going
to
recover
money
that
he
is
entitled
to
or
other
participants
in
the
plan
are
going
to
have
money
taken
away
from
them.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
for
that.
erisa
imposes
a
duty
of
loyalty
to
all
plan
participants.
if
they
breach
a
fiduciary
duty
which
causes
a
diminution
in
plan
assets
that
ultimately
will
affect
only
one
participant,
there
is...
it
goes
against
the
very
core
of
erisa
to
say
that
they
can
remedy
that
by
taking
money
from
innocent
fellow
participants.
and
that
really
goes
to
the
core
of
the
difference
between
an
(a)(2)
claim
and
an
(a)(3)
claim
on
one
hand,
and
an
(a)(1)
claim
on
the
other
hand.
one
thing
is
clear
here.
whether
or
not
mr.
larue
could
have
brought
an
(a)(1)(b)
claim,
it
would
not
under
any
circumstances
have
resulted
in
getting
money
from
the
fiduciary
back
into
the
plan.
absent
money
being
returned
to
the
plan,
there
can
be
no
meaningful
remedy
for
the
breach
that
occurred.
so
it
returns
us
to
the
core
question
in
this
case,
which
is
were
the
terms
of
(a)(2)
satisfied?
now,
the
court
of
appeals
basically
advanced
two
arguments
as
to
why
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
should
be
ignored.
the
primary
argument
was
a
fundamental
misinterpretation
of
this
court's
opinion
in
russell.
so
i'd
like
to
speak
about
that.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
certainly
if
you
agree
with
us
on
(a)(2),
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
reversed
on
that
issue.
we
ask
that
you
also
reach
the
(a)(3)
question,
because
this
case
was
decided
at
the
pleading
stage.
although
it
may
be
unlikely,
there
are
two
reasons
why
we
might
need
to
avail
ourselves
of
(a)(3)
on
remand.
the
first
is
that
facts
could
develop.
i
don't
have
any
reason
to
believe
they
will,
but
facts
could
develop
where
there
is
a
loss
to
mr.
larue's
beneficial
interest
but
not
a
loss
to
the
plan.
in
other
words,
they
took
his
money
and
they
gave
it
to
someone
else.
we
should
be
able
to
plead,
if
we
have
a
cognizable
claim
under
two
statutes,
both
of
them
and
then
discover
the
relevant
facts.
the
second
reason
why
you
should
reach
the
(a)(3)
question
is
additional
relief
may
be
available
under
(a)(3)
that
is
not
available
under
(a)(2).
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
our
theory
of
surcharge,
and
it's
also
the
government's
theory,
is
that
surcharge
is
a
make-whole
remedy
for
pecuniary
losses
that
are
caused
by
a
breach
of
trust.
it
is
clear
that
the
core
losses
are
diminution
in
trust
assets
or
failure
of
trust
assets
to
appreciate.
but
there
are
individual
pecuniary
losses
that
were
historically
remediable
under
surcharge.
for
example,
if
you
paid
out
of
pocket
for
an
auditor
to
figure
out
what
the
extent
of
a
fiduciary
breach
was,
a
premerger
court
of
equity
would
not
only
surcharge
your
harm,
the
harm
to
your
interest
in
the
trust,
but
they
also
would
return
to
you
the
money
that
you
spent
for
that
audit.
mr.
peter
k.
stris
well,
the
court
certainly
may
choose
not
to
reach
the
(a)(3)
issue,
so
i
can't
speak
to
that.
but
what
i
can
say
is
that
the
dicta
in
varity
that
describes
(a)(3)
as
a
catchall
provision...
it
is
clear
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
if
the
release
is
coterminous
under
the
two
provisions,
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
us
to
proceed
under
(a)(3).
but
that
is
not
a
pleading
question.
my
position
as
to
why
