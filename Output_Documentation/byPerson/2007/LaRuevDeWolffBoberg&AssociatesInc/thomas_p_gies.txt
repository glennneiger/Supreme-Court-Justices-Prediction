mr.
thomas
p.
gies
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
in
our
view
suggests
an
awkward
reading
of
section
409,
one
that
is
particularly
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
structure
of
the
civil
enforcement
provisions
of
section
%
02,
1132
of
the
u.s.
code,
starting
of
course
with
section
(a)(1)(b).
to
us
this
is
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
of
the
kind
of
case
the
court
was
talking
about
in
russell
and
what
russell
has
been
assumed
to
have
been
meant--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--you're
right,
your
honor,
that
that
is
certainly
distinguishable
on
the
facts.
we
think
the
central
teaching
of
russell,
though,
applies
with
equal
force
to
a
defined
contribution
case
like
this,
for
several
reasons.
the
first
of
which
is
that
russell
has
been
assumed
to
reflect
the
dicing
that
we
are
talking
about
which
provision
in
section
502
is
appropriate.
individual
claims
have
traditionally
been
brought
either
under
(a)(1)(b)
or
under
(a)(3).
when
a
claim
is
being
brought
on
behalf
of
the
plan
as
a
whole,
russell
teaches
and...
and
helps
define
when
those
claims
are
available.
it
is
an
odd
case
here,
where
the
plan
is
a
defendant,
to
at
the
same
time
assert
that
this
claim
is
being
brought
on
behalf
of
the
plan.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
well,
because
neither
(a)(2)
or
(a)(1)(b)
were
invoked
in
the
district
court
and
the
case
comes
up
on
a
very
spares
record,
it's
hard
to--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--the
difference
between
defined
contribution
plans
and
defined
benefit
plans
in
erisa
is
an
important
consideration
in
answering
that
question.
(a)(1)(b),
the
first
clause,
speaks
of
recovering
benefits
due
to
him.
as
you
know
from
our
briefs
we
argue
this
is
a
case
for
lost
profits,
not
benefits,
certainly
not
vested
benefits
in
the
way
the
court
used
the
term
in
firestone.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
(a)(1)(b)
definitely
was
available
for
the
petitioner
here.
what
relief
he
might
have
recovered
under
(a)(1)(b)
had
he
invoked
that
provision
remains
to...
would
have
remained
to
have
been
seen
had
it
been
invoked.
there
are
three--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--it
would
only
get
you
into
subsection
(2)
if
it
could
be
argued
that
that
claim
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
plan
as
a
whole,
as
this
court
has
taught
in
russell;
and
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
one
way
to
think
about
this
in
terms
of
which
provision
applies
to
which
of
these
claims,
is
whether
congress
really
intended
for
these
individual
kinds
of
"he
said;
she
said"
claims
to
be
brought.
we
think
not.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
well
we
think...
no.
no,
your
honor.
in
general
we
do
not
take
issue
with
that
premise.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
we
think
not
for
this
reason.
the
second
clause
of
(a)(1)(b)
permits
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
his
rights
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
this
is
a
case
that
if
you
give
the
petitioner
full
benefit
of
the
doubt
probably
could
have
been
resolved
with
a
telephone
call.
(a)(1)(b)
permits
an
action
to
enforce
his
rights
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
well,
we
think--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--well,
we
think
not
with
respect,
justice
souter,
for
this
reason.
keep
in
mind
the
theory
here
is
one
for
lost
appreciation
in
the
account.
this
plan
does
not
have
pooled
assets.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
souter,
is
that
it
reflects
how
careful
and
interrelated
these
provisions
in
502
are.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
to
which
we
say--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--well,
one
more
answer
to
your
question
about
(a)(1)(b),
justice
souter,
is
this:
as
you
know,
erisa
is
a
statute
that
provides
for
limited
remedies,
and
the
question
of
what
remedies
might
be
available
under
(a)(1)
and
whether
or
not
this
defendant
would
be
solvent
or
somebody
else
would
have
to
be
impleaded
in
our
view
need
not
be
decided
in
this
case.
we
think
it's
sufficient
to
identify
that--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--as
another
remedy
that
could
have
been
pursued
here.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
yes,
it
is,
and
it's
also
possible
depending
on
the
facts.
and
again,
from
this
sparse
record,
it's
hard
to
know
that
there
could
be
an
action
filed
against
whoever
it
was
who
is
alleged
to
have
made
the
mistake.
one
of
the
issues,
of
course,
in
this
case
is
it's
not
clear
who
made
the
mistake
or
whether
or
not
the
mistake
was
in
fact
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
what
you're
talking
about
i
think,
justice
scalia--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--was
a
plan
that
provides
for
pool
of
assets.
this
plan
does
not.
and
so
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
there
is
no
other
place
to
get
the
money
from,
which
we
think
is
another
reason
why
this
is
not
an
appropriate
claim
under
(a)(2).
it
is
not
losses
to
the
plan
in
the
conventional
way
we
understand
those
words.
but
the--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--well,
we
think
that
(a)(2),
properly
read,
does
not
permit
an
individual
claim.
(a)(3)
permits
a
claim
for
equitable
relief,
and
(a)(1)(b)
would
permit
a
claim
for
benefits
for
the
other
two.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
we
think
relief
in
that
situation,
including
recovery
of
the
diamonds
and
any
profits
associated
with
it,
would
be
available
under
(a)(3).
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i
think
the
structure
of
defined
contribution
plans
makes
that
a
little
inapt
of
an
analogy,
with
respect,
justice
breyer.
in
this
plan,
as
we
know,
the
assets
are
not
pooled.
it
is,
of
course,
the
sum
and
total
of
the
individual
plan
accounts,
but
the
question
of
legal
ownership
is
different
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
in
this
case
it
ought
to
be
read
as
losses
to
the
plan.
here
it
is
by
definition
the
most
individual
kind
of
claim
that
anybody
could
think
about.
it
is
a
run
of
the
mill,
as
alleged
claim
between
an
investor
and
a
stockbroker
essentially
that
the
stockbroker
did
not
execute
the
trade.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
yes,
we
do.
for--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--for
two
reasons,
first
of
all,
there
was
no
distribution
until
after
he
cashed
out
and,
second,
the
nature
of
this
claim,
again,
is
for
lost
profits.
it
is
not
for
benefits
as
in
the
sense
of
a
defined
benefit
plan.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
no.
because
there's
no
way
to
imagine
that
anybody
made
out
on
this.
this
is
a
case
where
the
investment
instruction
was
not
followed.
there's
no
way
to
imagine
that
my
clients
made
any
money
on
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
yes,
i
don't
think
the
actual
number
makes
any
difference,
but
i
think
the
nature
of
the
allegation,
the
type
of
fiduciary
breach,
does.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
in
the
"stock
drop"
cases--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--because
of
the
words
502.
the
words
"losses
to
the
plan"
connotes
something
collective.
the
example--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i
would...
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
useful
way
to
think
about
it
either,
justice
ginsburg,
which
is
why
i
think
the
right
way
to
think
about
it
in
the
context
of
this
statute
is
to
think
about
the
nature
of
the
allegation
at
the
pleading
stage.
in
the
stock
drop
cases,
the
fiduciary
breach
alleged
is
an
imprudent
investment
in
holding
company
stock.
i
think
the
diamond
analogy
is
closer
to
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i
think
that's
too
harsh
a
rule.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
well,
as
we've
argued
we
think
it
ought
to
be
a
substantial
subset
reflecting
the
nature
of
the
breach
alleged.
that
is,
something
systemic,
something
that
affects
the
interests
of
the
plan
as
a
whole
rather
than
just--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--one
individual
plan
participant.
for
example,
the
choice
of
an
imprudent
investment,
your
honor,
where...
and
that's
where
most
of
these
stock
drop
cases
come...
they
involve
company
stock
held
in
401(k)
plans,
and
the
allegation
is
that
it
is
imprudent
to
continue
to
hold
the
shares
of
the
stock.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
it...
it
very
well
might
be.
two--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--because--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--because
the
nature
of
the
dereliction
of
duty
here
is
the
most...
hard
to
conceive
of
a
more
individualistic
kind
of
a
breach.
this
is
just
one
dispute,
one
he
said/she
said
between
a
participant
and
the--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--to
which
we
would
say,
justice
souter,
that
it's
qualitatively
different
to
breach
a
duty
as
alleged
here
on
an
individual
basis,
on
a
one-transaction
basis,
in
one
account--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--well,
i
suppose
you
could
imagine,
justice
souter,
a
fact
pattern
where
there
was
evidence...
not
in
this
case,
of
course...
that
there
was
a
pattern,
a
systemic
failure
to
handle
properly
investment
requests
made
by--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--well
we
think
that
comes
closer
to
what...
how
we
read
russell
and
how
russell
has
been
understood.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
because
in
context
with
the
rest
of
502,
502(a)(2)
has
been
understood,
and
we
think
for
good
reason,
not
to
apply
to
an
individual
case.
there
are
other
remedies
available,
in
(a)(1)(b)--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--in
(a)(1)(b),
and
in
(a)(3)
for
equitable
relief.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
the
third
part
of
(a)(1)(b)
permits
a
participant
to
sue
to
enforce
his
rights
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
it
might
have
got
him
the
trade
made,
maybe
a
few
days
late.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
and...
and
is
that
a--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--and...
and
is
it
identified
in
one
account?
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
well,
that's...
that's
a
fundamental
difference.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
it's
still
the
same
kind
of
loss,
obviously.
you're
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i
do
indeed,
justice
breyer.
i
think
the
structure
of
the
plan
bears
something
on
the
right
answer
because
this
plan
does
not
have
pooled
assets
accounts,
there
is
no
way
that
this
alleged
loss
could
have
had
any
impact
on
any
other
plan
participant,
nor
could
any
recovery
here
benefit
the
plan
as
a
whole.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i'd
give
the
same
answer,
justice
stevens,
in
a
situation
like
this
with
what
i
call
the
classic
one-off,
he
said/she
said
request
to
make
a
brokerage
trade.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
i
could
imagine
a
situation
where
the
percentage
gets
so
high
that
the
assets
might
be
held
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
be
more
easily
seen
to
be
a
loss
to
the
plan
as
a
whole.
for
example,
in
some
of
these
plans
there's
a--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--that...
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
probably
depends
in
your
hypothetical
on
the
nature
of
the
asset.
if
it's
mutual
fund
shares,
as
in
this
plan
held
by
individuals,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference.
some
plans
hold
assets
in
common.
this
one
does
not.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
well,
we
certainly--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--i'm
fortunate
to
have
that
not
as
my
job,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
but
i
think...
i
think
it's
clearly
right
as
this
discussion
indicates
that
the
right
place
to
begin
here
is
with
(a)(1)(b).
if
you
have
a
claim
like
this,
you
look
at
the
statute,
it
comes
first.
it
has
the
benefit
of
being
first
on
the
page.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
right.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
that's
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer
because
this
is
a
defined
contribution
plan
and
not
a
defined
benefit
plan
and
this
is
a
claim
for
lost
profits.
it's
not
an
easy
claim
for
lost
benefits.
now
that's
why
the
second
clause
of
(a)(1)(b),
to
enforce
his
rights
under
the
plan,
we
think
is
the
best
part
of
(a)(1)(b)
that
this
individual
could
pursue.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
we
did
not,
but
our
amici
did.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
what
we
argue
in
our
brief
and
what
we
still
say
is
that
he
could
have
pursued
equitable
relief
under
(a)(3).
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
he
could
have
picked
up
the
telephone
and
called
and
said,
like
i
think
most
of
us
would,
say
i
asked
you
to
sell
my
sells
of
stock
and
it
hasn't
happened
yet.
and--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--well,
that's
not
so
clear
from
the
record,
justice
ginsburg,
but
in
any
case
what
equitable
relief
under
(a)(3),
just
as
(a)(1)(b)
would
permit
him,
is
to
get
an
injunction
to
force
the
trade
to
be
executed.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
it
may
or
may
not
be
much
too
late,
justice
ginsburg,
which
we
think
is
another
reason
why
as
to
(a)(2),
we
think
it's
unlikely
that
congress
intended
every
one
of
these
he
said/she
said
cases
to
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
for
damages.
there
would
be
no
end
to
the
kinds
of
claims
that
one
could
imagine.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
well,
certainly
injunctive
relief
under
(a)(3)
would
have
been
available.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
enjoining
him
to
execute
the
trade
was
clearly
a
remedy
available.
and
perhaps
there
would
have
been
a
remedy--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--well,
we
think
the
fact
that
it
took
him
so
long
to
sue
is
another
reflection
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
claim
for
damages.
had
he
really
intended
the
trade
to
have
been
made,
the
normal
thing
to
have
done
would
be
to
call
up
and
say
my
trade
wasn't
made,
please
make
it.
and
if
that
he
didn't
get
an
adequate
response,
you'd
bring
an
action
for
an
injunction.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
and
we
think
the
congress--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--we
think
that
congress
did
not
want
those
kinds
of
claims
to
be
brought
under
(a)(2)
precisely
for
that
kind
of
reason.
there
would
be
no
end
to
the
kind
of
arguments
about
damages.
and
those
kind
of
cases
impose
costs
that
will
ultimately
be
borne
by
the
plans,
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
purpose
in
erisa
to
encourage
plan
formation.
so
this
statute
on
this
kind
of
a
situation
may
provide
him
some
remedies
but
maybe
not
a
complete
remedy
for
loss
of
all
the
profits
that
he
claims
he
was
denied.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
we
think
we
have
a
different
situation
indeed
if
there
actually
had
been
a
distribution
here
and
the
amount
of
the
account
had
gone
down
between
the
alleged
mistake
and
the
distribution.
there
is
clear
as
a
claim
for
benefits
under
(a)(1)(b),
and
there
i
think
quite
easily
the
court
could
say
that
in
that
situation
the
full
value
of
the
account
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
mistake
would
be
benefits
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
and
we
think
that's
a
material
distinction
between
this
case
and
others,
including
the
case
called
glories
v.
charles
schwabb
that
comes
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
now
with
respect
to
(a)(3),
we
think
that
the
equitable
relief
is
properly
understood
not
to
include
compensatory
damages
and
that
this
court's
decisions
have
been
clear
on
that.
as
to
surcharge,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
one...
the
best
that
one
could
say
is
that
it
was
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
and
not
typically
available
in
the
course
of
equity
as
this
court
has
understood--
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
--and
never
available
in
a
court
of
law.
you're
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
well,
i
think
what
it
was,
as
i
understand
the
history
of
the
equity
jurisprudence,
is
that
you
could
only
sue
the
trustee
in
the
equity
courts.
and
so
if
you
needed
to
get
money
and
if
it
was
a
damages
claim,
that
was
the
only
place
where
you
could
bring
the
action.
mr.
thomas
p.
gies
it
is
not,
your
honor.
as
we
understand
the
argument
on
surcharge,
it
is
separate
from
clean
up
and
we
understand
that
and
accept
that.
but
it
still
sounds
more
like
damages.
it
sounds
something
very
different
from
what
congress,
we
think,
meant
when
they
wrote
the
language
of
502.
unlike
the
landrum
griffin
act,
which
permits
actions
for
damages,
erisa
does
not,
and
landrum
griffin
was
one
of
the
statutes
on
which
erisa
was
based.
it
also
has
fiduciary
duty
obligations.
it
also
has
the
interests
of
beneficiaries,
members
of
labor
unions
at
heart.
and
unlike
this
provision
in
erisa,
the
landrum
griffin
act
explicitly
permits
an
action
for
damages.
and
we
think
that's
further
evidence
of
the
fact
that
appropriate
equitable
relief
in
a
situation
like
this
under
(a)(3)
does
not
include
a
claim
like
this
for
compensatory
damages.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
