justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
whether
the
(a)(2)
argument
would
be
available
to
you
on
remand
even
if
we
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
that
provision?
didn't
judge
wilkinson
say
pretty
clearly
that
the
argument
had
been
waived?
he
said,
"even
if
the
argument
were
not
therefore
waived.
"
doesn't
that
mean
that
it
was
waived?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
maybe...
maybe
they've
waived
the
waiver,
but
judge
wilkinson
is
a
careful
writer,
and
if
you
use
the
subjunctive
there...
"even
if
the
argument
were
not
therefore
waived.
"
--doesn't
that
mean
it
was
in
fact
waived?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
agree
to
you
on
(a)(2),
is
there
any
need
to
get
to
(a)(3)?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
that
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
dispute
that
there
was
not...
that
there
was
a
loss
to
the
plan
in
the
literal
sense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
if
you
accept
the
truth
of
his
allegations,
wouldn't
the
plan
have
greater
assets
than
it
had?
