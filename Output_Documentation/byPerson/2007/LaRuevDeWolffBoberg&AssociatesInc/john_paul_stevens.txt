justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
a
question
about
your
individual
point?
what
if
the
individual's
account
was
60
percent
of
the
assets
of
the
total
plan?
because
different
accounts
are
of
different
sizes.
would
you
give
the
same
answer
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
was
90
percent,
you'd
give
the
same
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
just
one
individual,
as
far
as
we
know
it's
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
total.
that's
the
whole
case
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
first
of
the
two
cases,
larue
against
the
dewolff
associates,
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
petitioner
filed
the
action
against
his
former
employer
in
the
defined
contribution
punishment
--
pension
plan
that
it
administers.
the
plan
permits
participants
such
as
larue
to
direct
the
investment
of
their
contributions
in
accordance
with
specified
procedures
and
requirements.
he
alleges
that
the
plan
administrator
failed
to
follow
his
investment
directions
and
that
that
failure
resulted
in
the
depletion
of
the
value
of
his
interest
in
the
plan
by
approximately
$150,000
and
that
that
failure
was
a
–
a
breach
of
duty
under
the
terms
of
the
employment
retirement
income
security
act,
erisa.
the
district
court
granted
the
respondent's
motion
for
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings
and
the
court
of
the
appeals
affirmed.
relying
on
our
opinion
in
the
--
the
russel
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
erisa,
section
502(a)(2)
provides
remedies
only
for
entire
plans
and
not
for
specific
individuals.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
vacate
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
for
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
although
502(a)(2)
does
not
provide
a
remedy
for
individual
injuries
distinct
from
plain
injuries,
the
provision
does
authorize
recovery
for
–
for
fiduciary
breaches
that
impair
the
value
of
plan
assets
in
a
participant's
individual
account.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
that
justice
kennedy
has
joined.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
that
justice
scalia
has
joined.
