justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
code
numbers
of
those?
i
really
get
confused
with
you
people
who
work
with
erisa
all
the
time...
can
refer,
you
know
section
3
of
erisa.
i
use
the
code.
what...
what
code
sections
are
you
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
wasn't
in
the
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
in
the
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine,
so
why
doesn't
he
proceed
first
under
(a)(1)(b),
against
the
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
plan
owes
him
this
money.
and
if
the
plan
turns
around
and
says
well,
you
know
the
fiduciary
didn't
invest
your
funds
the
way
it
was
supposed
to,
the
plan
still
owes
him
the
money,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
(a)(1)(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
is...
there
is
this
to
suggest
that
only...
only
that
manner
of
proceeding
preserves
the
structure
of...
of
the
legislation
which
is
that
you're
supposed
to
first
apply
to
the
plan
and
exhaust
your
remedies
there
before
you
come
into
court;
and
interpreting
it
that
way
would
preserve
that...
that
exhaustion
requirement.
you
have
to
apply
to
the
plan
first,
and
if
you
establish
that
the
plan
owes
you
money,
then
it's
a
loss
to
the
plan
and
you
can
sue
in
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
come
back
to
your
earlier
point
that
the
second
requirement
of
(a)(2)...
it's
actually
a
requirement
of
1109--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
not
met.
and
that
is...
that
is
to...
to
make
good
to
such
plan
any
losses
to
the
plan
resulting
from
each
such
breach.
in
these
welfare
plans,
if
you
sue
the
plan,
claiming
some
welfare
benefits
that
haven't
been
provided,
wouldn't
the
plan
have
to
provide
those
benefits?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
be
a
loss
to
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
an
entitlement
to
certain...
certain
welfare
payments.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
if
you
sue
the
plan
and
require
the
plan
to
pay
what
the
plan
has
committed
to
pay,
whereupon
the
plan
would
have
a
right
of
action
against
the
fiduciary,
i
assume,
for
the
fiduciary's
failure
to
do
what
he
was
supposed
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
would
preserve
the
necessity
of
going
through
the
exhaustion
requirement
first.
you
apply
to
the
plan
and
say
the
plan
owes
me
this
cancer
treatment,
and
the
plan
says
"yes,
we
do"
or
"no,
we
don't".
if
it
says
"yes,
we
do",
it's
liable
to
you
and
then
the
plan
can...
can
recover
over
against
the
trustee.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
just
if
the
money
is
payable
to
him
today.
it
says,
"to
enforce
his
rights
under
the
terms
or
to
clarify
his
rights
to
future
benefits
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
there's
no
money
in
his
account,
it
seems
to
me
he
could
bring
an
action
to
clarify
that
even
if
there
is
no
money
in
his
account
the
plan
owes
him
future
benefits
in
that
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
plan
wouldn't
necessarily
pay
out
any
money.
what
would
happen
is,
after
the
administrative
determination
by
the
plan
that
it
does
owe
the
money,
he
would
sue
the
plan
for
the
money
and
the
plan
would
implead
the
trustee
who
was
responsible
for
this.
it
ends
up
the
same
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
happen
if
the
trustee
does
not
have
the
money?
the
trustee
not
only
squandered
your
client's
money;
he
squandered
his
own.
he's
just
really
in
bad
shape.
he
has
no
money
to
cough
up.
what
happens
to
your
client?
doesn't
your
client
get
that
money
from
the
plan
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
picking,
as
you
put
it,
by
picking
the
pockets
of
the
other
plan
participants?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
answer
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
participated
in
the
plan.
it
was
a
failure
of
the
trustee
for
the
plan.
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
plan
should
be
liable
for
it.
i
mean
that's
how
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
section
(a),
(a)(1)(b)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unlike
section
(a)(2),
which
refers
you
to
1109,
does
not
say
who
gets
sued.
under
1109
it's
clear
who
gets
sued.
it's
the
fiduciary
who
gets
sued.
i
find
it
very
curious
that
(a)(1)(b)
just
says
a
civil
action
may
be
brought
to
recover
benefits
due
to
him
under
the
terms
of
his
plans
or
to
clarify
his
right
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
implication
there
is
that
the
suit...
the
suit
is
against
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
where?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
well.
but
i'm
just
talking
right
now
of
(a)(1)(b),
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
logical
reading
of
that
is
that
the
suit
is
against
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
1132
we
are
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
united
states
code.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
useful
to
have
a
code.
it
really
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
entirely
clear
that
the
plan
itself
does
not
have
any
money
to
pay
this
off
unless
it
takes
the
money
from
other
individual
accounts?
i
thought
one
of
the
briefs
said
that...
that
some
plans
have
independent
funds.
i
forget
what
sources
they
came
from,
but
some
slush
fund
that
they
could
use
for
this
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
called
a
slush
fund.
i
know
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
i
could
understand
your
case
if
you
said
even
if
there
were
a
hundred
diamonds,
each
of
them
in
an
individual
plan,
there
still
is
no
loss
to
the
plan
until
the
plan
itself
has
been
held
liable
to
make
up
for
the
loss.
up
until
that
point,
it's
just
a
loss
in
each
of
the
individual
accounts.
but
you're
not
willing
to
say
that.
you
say
at
some
ineffable
point
it
becomes
a
loss
to
the
plan.
i
think
there
is
a
clear
line
between...
between
saying
there
is
no
loss
to
the
plan
unless...
unless
the
plan
is
first
adjudicated
to
be
liable;
then
there
is
a
loss
to
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
prior
to
that
it's
just
a
loss
to
the
individual
account.
that
makes
some
sense.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
how
that
works.
i
can't
understand
how
your
system
works.
you're
telling
me
it
depends
on
how
big
the
diamond
is
and...
and
what
kind
of
a
breach
it
was.
how
can
we
write
an
opinion
like
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
done
meanwhile?
he
came
in
right
at
the
bottom
and
a
week
later,
it
had
gone
up
30
points.
justice
antonin
scalia
--no
remedy?
