why...
why
isn't
that
an
equally
response
to
what
justice
ginsburg
just
gave
as
a
recitation
of
what
the
what
the
judge
had
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
she
quoted
and
summarized
the
judge
saying
he's
going
to
do
it
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
anybody
knows
that
what
the
judge
is
getting
at
is
i'm
going
to
put
him
away
as
long
as
i
can
put
him
away.
isn't
that
just
as
much
notice
or
just
as
much
a...
a
stimulus
to
the
response
that
you
want
to
give,
as
your
reformulation
of
the...
of
the
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
not
the
question
of
notice;
it's
the
question
of
time
to
respond.
