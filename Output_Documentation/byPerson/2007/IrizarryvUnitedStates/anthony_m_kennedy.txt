justice

may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
rule:
it
says
before
the
court
may
depart
from
the
applicable
sentencing
range
on
a
ground
not
identified
for
departure.
can
a
pre-sentence
report
say
possible
grounds
for
departure
are
as
follows,
and
then
list
them?
or
does
this,
in
your
view,
mean
that
"identified
for
departure"
means
as
recommended
by
the
pre-sentencing
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
the
pre-sentencing
report
just
list
a
series
of...
a
whole
series
of
factors
saying
these
are
possible
grounds
for
departure?
would
that
comply
with
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
future
dangerousness...
future
dangerousness
be
something
that
could
be
put
in
the
report
and
that
would
cover
these--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
the
latest
thing
we're
talking
about
very
much.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
standardized?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
unworkable
or
is
there
just
as
many
impracticalities
as
the
rule.
