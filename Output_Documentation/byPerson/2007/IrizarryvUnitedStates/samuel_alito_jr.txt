justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
district
court
in
this
case
had
said
i'm
considering
an
above-guidelines
sentence
based
on
facts
that
are
in
the
record
in
the
pre-sentence
report
to
protect
the
public
from
further
crimes
of
the
defendant.
would
that
be
adequate
notice?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
seem
to
be
requiring
a
very
specific
kind
of
notice,
almost
as
if
the
district
court
has
to
say
this
is
the
sentence
that
i'm
considering,
and
these
are
the
exact
reasons
that
i'm
considering;
now
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
what
you're
asking?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why
would
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
shouldn't
this
rule
be
dealt
with
by
further
rulemaking?
it
is
very
clear
that
when
32(h)
was
adopted,
departure
had
a
specific
meaning
under
the
guidelines.
and
what
we're
talking
about
now
was
not
contemplated
at
all
by
the
rulemakers
at
that
time.
now,
applying
3553(a)
in
this
situation
raises
different
problems,
and
there
are
issues
regarding
the
specificity
of
the
notice
that's
required
and
the
timing
of
the
notice.
why
shouldn't
this
be
dealt
with
by
further
rulemaking
when
those...
where
those
things
can
be
handled
in
a
comprehensive
way
rather
than
by
the
haphazard
development
of
case
law
by
the
courts
of
appeals
if
we
agree
with
your
position.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
saying--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--are
you
saying
that
if
they
had
in
mind
at
the
time
that
booker
might
be
coming
down
the
road.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
would
be
non-guidelines
variances
from
the
sentencing
guidelines.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
specific
does
the
notice
have
to
be?
i
take
it
it's
not
enough
just
to
recite
one
of
the
3553(a)
factors.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
was
required
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
didn't
the
decision
that
the
guidelines
are
not
mandatory
make
what
used
to
be
known
as
guidelines
departures
completely
irrelevant?
a
case
that
would
qualify
for
a
guidelines
departure
would,
by
definition,
be
a
case
in
which
the
3553(a)
factors
justified
a
sentence
other
than
a
guidelines
sentence?
so
i
don't
understand
why
there's
any
need
to
go
through
the
departure
analysis
any
longer
at
all.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
just
don't
understand
that.
you're
not...
a
court...
a
sentencing
court,
after
concluding
that
there
is
no
ground
for
a
departure
under
booker
and
the
later
cases,
then
has
to
consider
the
3553(a)
question.
so
the
decision
about
the
departures
is
irrelevant.
it
is
not
dispositive;
and,
if
the
court
finds
that
the
case
qualified
for
a
guidelines
departure,
as
i
said
before,
by
definition,
that
is
going
to
be
a
case
where
the
3553(a)
factors
warranted
a
non-guidelines
sentence
anyway.
so
it
seems
like
a
useless
appendage
at
this
point.
