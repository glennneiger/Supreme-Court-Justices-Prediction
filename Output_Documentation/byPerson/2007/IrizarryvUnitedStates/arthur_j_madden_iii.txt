mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
sentencing
process
case.
the
first
step
of
the
sentencing
process
described
by
the
court
in
rita,
as
noticed,
broke
down
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
first
learned
that
the
district
court
contemplated
a
non-guideline
sentence
when
it
was
pronounced.
the
grounds
for
that
statutory
maximum
sentence
were
not
noticed
and
the
issues
were,
therefore,
not
litigated.
the
government
here
agrees
that
the
lack
of
notice
was
error
and
advocates
notices
for
all
sentences
outside
the
guidelines.
this
is
the
correct
result.
because
it's
only
through
notice
can
the
sentencing
court
subject
a
defendant's
sentence
to
the
thorough
adversarial
testing
contemplated
by
federal
sentencing
procedure.
that
quote
comes
from
rita
and
relies
upon
rules
32(f),
(h),
(i),
and
a
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
burns.
that
law
controls
the
decision
in
this
case.
the
position
of
the
amicus--
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--the...
the...
the
notice
that
suggested...
the
guidelines
departure
which
is
suggested
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
pre-sentence
report,
is
very
specific.
it
is
directed
toward
the
4a1.3
departure.
the
concerns
raised
by
that
are
completely
different
than
the
grounds
on
which
the
court
departed.
so,
no,
that
wasn't
adequate
notice.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
well,
it
was
looked
at
in
the
context
of
the
sixth
level
enhancement
for
intent
to
carry
out
the
threat,
and
it
did
come
up
in
the
context
of
acceptance
of
responsibility.
but
both
look
at
different
issues
than
the
ground
that
the
sentence
was
ultimately...
the...
the
upward
non-guideline
sentence
was
ultimately
imposed
on.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
think
first
it
would
seem
to
make...
it
would
not
make
sense
to
demand
notice
for
a
finite
range
of
factors,
but
no
notice
for
a
potentially
broader
one.
that
seems
counter-intuitive.
but--
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--but
the...
the
decision
of...
in
burns,
i
think,
answers
the
question
because
unless
there's...
if
a
party
is
not
focused...
and
generally
the
parties'
papers
and
the
psr
will
focus
the
issues.
but
in
the
few
cases
where...
where
an
extraneous
sentencing
consideration
that's
important
enough
to
drive
the
sentence
up
or
down
is
raised,
in
order
to
have
adversarial
testing
of
that
important
issue,
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
notice.
and
it's
not...
variance
is
not
what
we're
calling
a
variance,
a
non-guidelines
sentence
is
not
a
pure
exercise
in
policy
even
in
kimbrough.
that
was
a
policy
disagreement
but
it
was
driven
by
facts,
and
the
defendant
in
that
case,
the
appellant,
gave
notice
that
they
were
going
to
be
challenging
it,
and...
and
there
was
a
factual
presentation.
so
the
record
was
in
the
right
shape
to
make
the
policy
determination.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
i
remember
that
system.
i
think
the...
the
answer
is
that...
that
it...
it's
important...
the
requirement
is
essential
for
purposes
of
advocacy
on
the
issues.
burns...
burns
reflects
the
court's
understanding
again
of
what
congress
intended
in
the
sentencing
reform
act.
they
said
congress
intended
notice
and
litigation.
now,
this
court
had
to
make
some
excisions
on
sixth
amendment
grounds
in
what
congress...
what
congress
could
do,
but
their
intent
hasn't
changed.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
no.
not
on
the
grounds
here.
it's
close.
it's
closer.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
reading
it
backward
from
what
the
comment...
the
explanation
of
the
sentence
at
the
end
backwards
to
what
the
grounds
were
and
the
notice
should
have
been,
her
finding
was
that...
that
he
would
continue
to
be
a
threat
regardless
of
the
supervision
we
are
under.
that
was
the
key.
to
say
if
there
is
nothing
other
than
maximum
incapacitation
which
will
prevent
him
from
being
a
danger
in
the
future,
if
that
was
the
issue,
if
the
question
is:
is
there
any
lesser
sentence
than
maximum
extra
incapacitation,
then
everyone
could
have
litigated,
that
would
have
been
the
issue
that
was
on
the
table.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
yes.
and
i
think
that
goes
with
the
justice's
second
question.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--content...
it
needs
to
be
specific...
it
needs
to
be
specific
enough
so
that
the
facts
that
get
litigated
are
the
ones
that
are
ultimately
recited
by
the
court
for
the
reason
for
the
non-guidelines
sentence.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
i
think
if...
if
she
would
have
said
something
to
the
effect
that...
and
this
sometimes
happens
during
the
course
of
a
sentencing,
that's
a
different
issue...
but
here's
what's
on
my
mind.
i'm
concerned
that
only
extra
prison
time,
incapacitation
for
as
long
as
i
can
give
him,
will
do
the
job
of
protecting
society.
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
if
that
was
the...
now
isn't
the
written,
formal,
this
is
during
the
context
of
the
sentencing...
the
way
it
comes
out,
then
the
response
would
be
something
like,
"judge,
there's...
there
is
psychiatric
evidence
or
psychological
evidence
that's
developed
that
i'd
like
to
put
on
bearing
on
that
issue
in
light
of
the
report
from
buttner,
the
new
report
that
just
came
into
the
record
right
before
the
sentencing,
that
goes
directly
to
the
issue
of
amenability
to
treatment;
and
you're
concerned
that
only
maximum
incapacitation
will
address
the
issue.
"
"i
think
that's
how
that...
that's
how
it
should
have
played
out.
"
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
the--
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
yes,
and
that
goes
to
the
timing
question.
when
she
said
that,
the
next...
in
the
same
paragraph,
was...
and,
and
therefore,
it's
a
60-month
sentence.
that...
that
discussion
didn't
occur...
the
notice
didn't--
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--at
that
point
it
was
explanation,
it
explanation
of
what
she
was
doing,
not
notice
of
what
she
was
going
to
do
at
a
time
when
it
would
have
made
a
difference.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
usually.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
i--
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--i
think
in...
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
and
the
government
concedes
this
in
the
brief
or
acknowledges
it,
that
while
there
are
infinite
number
of
variables
that
lurk
in
every
case,
practically,
there
are
not
that
many
that
are
actually
there.
those
are
usually
identified
in
the
pre-sentence
report
which
you
have
way
in
advance
or
in
advance.
there
are...
the
parties
have
a
duty
to
identify
the
issues
that
are
going
to
be
litigated;
and
that's
done.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
yes.
and
that's
typically--
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--no.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
no,
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that's
what
occurs.
and
then
the
parties
have
a
duty
to
interject
issues
that
they
think
ought
to
drive
the
guidelines
or
non-guidelines
either
way.
and
the
bar
is
actually
getting
better
at
that
than
when
this
occurred
in
picking
up
on
3553(a)
factors,
and
i
think
the
problem
is
actually
going
to
become
lesser
over
time.
so
only
in
the
extraordinary
cases...
and
burns
was
an
extraordinary
case...
where
an
issue
that
is
important
to
the
judge
isn't
flagged
in
the
papers...
does
the
duty
arise
to
let...
let
the
parties
know
what
considerations
they
should
focus
their
attention
on,
so
that
they
can
be
litigated.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
usually,
the
interests,
of
course,
are
different.
the...
the
interests
of
the
defendant
in...
in
a
lower
sentence,
i
think,
is
different
than
defending
against
a
higher...
a
higher
sentence;
but
yes,
i
think
it
is
appropriate.
and
the
rule
says...
rule
32(h)
only
speaks
to
the
judge.
but
i
think
the
parties
in
their
positions
are
required
by
the
local
rule
in
the
southern
district
of
alabama
and
the
federal
rule
generally
to
put
their...
their
positions
in
writing
in
advance
of
the
hearing.
i
think
our
rule,
i
believe,
is
seven
days.
so
that
when
the
judge,
before
getting
ready
to
sentence,
looks
at
the
issues,
the
people
with
the
heightened
interest
in
them
have
already
identified
what
they
are.
so
the
only...
it's
only
the
residual
issues
that
are
picked
up
by
rule
32.
it
occurs
very
infrequently
in
practice.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
it
is...
you
know,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
extremely
wasteful.
it
does
not
promote
focused
advocacy.
the
sentences
that
are
going
to
come
out
of
that
kind
of
system
won't
be
on
a
developed
record.
the
sentences
in
the
aggregate
will
be
less
reliable
for
purpose
of
evolution
of
the
guidelines.
there's...
there
are...
the
reasons
for
notice
i
think
are
in...
notice
is
important
not
only
for
the
individual
defendant
but
there's
institutional
interests
as
well.
it's
a...
it's
a
fairly
rarely
occurring
phenomenon
where
rule
32(h)
comes
into
play.
the
rule
as
written
doesn't
demand
any
changes.
it
is
a
matter
of
interpretation.
and
the
sentencing
commission
itself
defines
a
departure
as
any
non-guidelines
sentence.
that
fits
within
the
literal
language
of
rule
32(h).
this
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
this
case.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
well,
the
court
in
rita,
which
was
after
booker,
discussed
in
fact,
the
sentencing
court,
applying
the
guidelines
in
individual
cases,
may
depart
either
pursuant
to
the
guidelines
or
since
booker
by
imposing
a
non-guidelines
sentence.
the
word
departure--
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--it...
it
had
a
narrower
meaning
but...
but
the
rule
32(h)
was
to
implement
the
structure
of
rule
32,
that's
what
burns
said.
and--
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that
answers
the
question,
because
under
the
prior
structure
of
the
rule,
the
pre-sentencing
was
supposed
to
set
out
all
of
the
factors
and
(h)
was
just...
just
a
stopgap.
the
provision
that
came
in
in
december
of
'07
that
says
that
the
court
can
request
other
factors,
i
think
is
just
that
an
authorization
to
the
probation
officer
to
look
at...
to
look
at
other
factors
and
to
think
more
broadly.
but
i
don't
think
that
should
be
read
as
limiting
the
scope
of
32(h)
simply
to
what
would
be
traditional
guideline
departures.
if
i
could,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
thank
you.
i
think
justice
breyer
is
correct
that
rule
32(e)
is...
requires
that
the
parties
have
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
matters
appropriate
to
the
sentencing.
that
opportunity
extends
to
not
only
guidelines
departures
but
also
what
has
been
called
variances.
there
are
two
reasons
why
it's
important
that
that...
that
right
comes
with
a
notice
requirement.
the
first
is
that
fairness
for
the
individual
defendant,
the
ability
to
litigate
the
issues
that
are
going
to
make
a
difference
in
his
sentencing.
the
other
is
that
it
permits
as
an
institutional
issue
effective
appellate
review,
if
there's
a
developed
record
and
evolution
of
the
guidelines
by
looking
at
the
aggregate
of
cases.
if
the
court's
decision
is
that
we're
going
to
exempt
from
notice
requirement
the
cases
that
are
going...
the
sentences
that
are
going
to
be
driven
towards
the
margin,
high
or
low,
the
goal
of
uniformity
that
congress
sought
in
the
sentencing
reform
act
would
be
lost.
and
i
submit
that
that's
an
independent
reason
why
the
court
ought
to
require
notice
is
because
otherwise,
it's
inviting
the
sentencing
disparities
which
the
architecture
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
is
designed
to
eliminate.
as
far
as
workability,
it
is
extremely
rare
that
the
issues
aren't
flagged
in
the
papers.
it
is
not
going
to
come
up
frequently.
rule
32(h)
issues
don't
come
up
terribly
frequently,
at
least
in
my
practice
in
the
appellate
cases.
five
circuits
below
have...
saw
no
workability
problem
with
extending
the
notice
requirement
of
rule
32(h)
to
variances
as
well.
mr.
arthur
j.
madden,
iii
thank
you.
