what
would
have
been?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
much
time...
this
is
two
questions;
time
question
and
the
content
question.
what
would
she
have
had
to
say
to
comply
with
the
rule
as
you
read
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
complex
answer.
and
i...
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
clear
case
of
what
was
in
the
judge's
mind.
she
said
i
have
a
record
here
of
repeated
e-mails
to
this
woman,
threatening
to
kill
her,
threatening
to
kill
her
new
husband,
threatening
to
kill
her
mother.
he
did
it
again
and
again
and
again.
i
have
seen
this
person,
he
appeared
before
me.
it
is
my
educated
prediction
that
he
will
do
it
again.
so
i'm
going
to
put
him
away
for
as
long
as
i
can.
that's...
her
reasoning
process
is
not
at
all
mysterious.
what
notice
is
the
defendant
lacking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
we
put
into
rule
32(h),
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
the
3553(a)
factors,
when
we
know
that
the
rule
makers
did
make
a
change
in
2007?
that
is
they
put
3553(a)
into
32(d)(2)(f);
so
they
made
a
change
there
and
they
said
the
judge
could
ask
to
have
these
things
included
in
the
pre-sentence
report;
but
they
left
(h)
looking
like
it's
dealing
just
with
the
guidelines.
why
couldn't
the
court
say
well,
we
didn't
put
3553
in
(h),
and
so
it's
not
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
couldn't
you
have
asked
at
the
hearing,
couldn't
you
ask
the
judge:
judge,
please
have
a
continuance
here
because
you
have
taken
us
by
surprise
and
we'd
like
to
offer
some
evidence
that
you...
that
might
influence
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when?
i
asked
mr.
madden
and
didn't
get
a
precise
answer:
when
does
this
notice
have
to
be
given?
we're
told
that
the
court
itself
did
not
get
the
full
sentencing
packet
until
seven
days
before
the
hearing.
so
when
must
this
notice
be
given
and
how
much
does
it
have
to
say?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
think
that
this
case
is
a
poor
example
because
you're
urging
us
to
apply
the
harmless
error
rule
and
say
this
case
would
have
come
out
the
same
way--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we...
if
we
grant
the
review
so
we
can
resolve
the
question,
does
the
judge
have
to
give
notice
or
not?
and
if
she
has
to
give
notice,
what
time?
what
content?
but
now
you're
urging
us
to
say...
to
do
something
that
ordinarily
this
court
doesn't
do,
that
trial
judges
do,
to
deal
with
harmless
error,
which
would
be
spending
our
time
on
this
very
particular
case
setting
no
law
for
any
other
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
it
would
be
easy
for
a
district
judge
to
escape
any
obligation
to
give
32(h)
notice
because
he
could
simply
say:
oh,
yeah,
before
i
would
have
ranked
this
as
a
sentencing
guidelines
matter,
but
now
i'm
treating
it
as
a
3553(a)
factor,
so
i
don't
have
to
bother
with
32(h)
anymore.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
it
just
whatever
is
the
reason
that
the
judge
is
considering
is
going
outside
the
advisory
guidelines,
whatever
that
reason
is,
just
say
it.
so
the
judge
says...
could
say
here,
"i'm
contemplating
going
outside
because
i
don't
think
that
this
man
is
going
to
stop
these
threats.
"
period.
that's
all.
