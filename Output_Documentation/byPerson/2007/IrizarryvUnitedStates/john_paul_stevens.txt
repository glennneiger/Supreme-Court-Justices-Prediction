justice
john
paul
stevens
could
we
go
back
to
the
example
for
just
a
minute?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
fully
understand
it.
why
couldn't
that
issue
have
been
adequately
discussed
at
a
hearing
in
which
there
was
no
particular
notice,
but
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
the
judge
said,
this
is
what
i'm
planning
to
do
because
i'm
worried
that
they
won't
get
treatment
in
prison
and
so
forth?
well,
wouldn't
the
government
have
had
an
opportunity
to
then
say,
judge,
you
overlooked
this
fact?
and
wouldn't
all
involved
in
the
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
couldn't
the
lawyer
have
done
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
that
solves
the
problem
because
the
judge
apparently
was
operating
under
a
misunderstanding
of
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
lawyer
could
say
you're
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
your
experience,
do
judges
often
bring
in
experts
on
this
kind
of
stuff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
judges...
do
judges
say,
"oh,
this
is
very
interesting;
i'm
going
to
have
a
new
hearing?
"
i
mean,
how
long
do
these
hearings
go
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
that,
routinely
in
sentencing
matters,
you
have
expert
who
come
in
and
advise
the
judge
of
programs
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
we
are
asked
to
determine
whether
rule
32(h)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
requiring
notice
when
a
district
judge
imposes
a
sentence
that
departs
from
the
recommended
federal
guidelines
range
applies
even
when
the
district
judge
imposes
a
non-guideline
sentence
not
as
a
departure
governed
by
the
rules
found
in
the
guidelines
but
rather
has
a
variance
from
the
non-advisory
guidelines.
petitioner
pleaded
guilty
to
one
count
of
making
a
threatening
interstate
communication.
the
pre-sentence
report
prepared
by
the
probation
office
recommended
a
guideline
sentence
at
a
range
of
from
41
to
51
months
of
imprisonment.
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
the
district
judge
explained
why
she
had
concluded
that
the
guidelines
range
would
not
provide
an
appropriate
sentence
and
actually
sentenced
the
petitioner
to
the
statutory
maximum
the
60
months
and
upward
variance
of
nine
months.
defense
counsel
objected
to
the
sentence
on
the
ground
that
the
judge
had
not
given
notice
that
she
was
contemplating
a
sentence
higher
than
the
guidelines
range.
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
petitioner's
sentence.
we
granted
certiorari
because
the
court
of
appeals
are
divided
with
respect
to
rule
32(h)
applies
to
variances.
rule
32(h)
was
promulgated
in
response
to
our
5-to-4
decision
in
1991
in
united
states
against
burns.
by
interpreting
the
earlier
version
of
rule
32
to
require
notice
of
contemplated
departures,
we
avoided
answering
the
constitutional
question
whether
such
notice
would
be
required
by
the
due
process
clause.
because
the
guidelines
range
are
now
advisory,
the
concerns
that
motivated
the
majority
in
burns
do
not
provide
a
sufficient
basis
for
extending
rule
32(h)
to
cover
variances
from
the
guidelines
range.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
kennedy,
souter,
ginsburg
have
joined.
