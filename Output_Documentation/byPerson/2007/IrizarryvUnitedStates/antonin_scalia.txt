justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know
this...
this
provision
32(h),
really
doesn't...
does
simply
not
work
with
post-booker
guidelines.
you
either
have
to
say
it
was
designed
for
a
different
regime,
and
therefore,
has
no
effect
now
after
booker,
or
else
you
have
to
expand
it
beyond
what
it
says,
because
may
depart
from
the
applicable
sentencing
range
on
a
ground
not
identified,
under
the
mandatory
guidelines,
they
were
identified
grounds
for
departure.
and
you
had
some...
the
court
could
look
at
those
and
say,
gee,
am
i
going
to
pick
one
of
these,
if
so
i'll
let
him
know.
but
you
can
depart
now
simply
on
the
ground
that
you
don't
agree
with
the...
with
what
the
guidelines
say
as...
is
that
what
you
would
call
a
ground
of
departure?
it's
simply
a
ground
of
disagreement,
i
would
suppose.
why
shouldn't
we
hold
32(h)
simply.
simply
has
no...
no
application
under
the
new
system?
or
at
least
hold
that
all
it
applies
to
are
departures
within
the
meaning
of
the
old
mandatory
guidelines
system?
which
is
a
much
narrower
category
of
departures.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
is
counter-intuitive
to
provide...
to...
to
require
notice
when
the
number
of
grounds
is
finite.
but
if
the
number
of
grounds
is
infinite,
i'm
much
less
inclined
to
read
it
as
even
applicable
to
the
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
post-booker
the
guidelines
are
advisory,
and
the
district
judge
has
discretion
as
to
the
sentence.
now,
in
the
bad
old
days,
when
the
statute
said
20
to
40,
and
the
judge
decided
to
give
you
40,
he
didn't
have
to
give
you
notice
of
why
he
was
giving
you
the
highest
sentence.
and
now
that
we've
returned
to
a
system
that
is
closer
to
that,
why
should
we
interpret
32(h)
as
imposing
a
very
difficult
to
comply
with
requirement
that
didn't
exist
under
the...
under
the
pre-pre-booker
system?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
she
supposed
to
do?
usually
there...
there's
just
one
sentencing
hearing,
right?
and
there's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
pre-sentence
report
which
both
parties
have.
and
sometimes
there
are
witnesses
who
come
in.
sometimes
the
injured
parties
or
the
relatives
of
the
deceased
party
come
in;
and...
and
usually
the
sentence
is
imposed
at
the
end
of
that
proceeding.
now
when
is...
when
is
the
judge
supposed
to
be
so
precise
as
to
what
particular
matters
induce
her
to...
to
raise
this
sentence
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
have
a
recess?
or
maybe
reschedule
the
sentencing
for...
for
a
week
later
so
that
the
judge
can
decide
in
detail
what
particular
factors
motivate
her?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
if
it
is
in
the
pre-sentence
report,
is
that
enough
notice?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
it
is
in
the
pre-sentence
notice
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
say
i
plan
to
rely
on
this
aspect
of
the
pre-sentence
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
what
it
meant
when
32(h)
was
promulgated.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
apply
departure
to
post-booker;
but
at
the
time
this
rule
was
adopted,
departure
did
not
consist
of
that;
it
consisted
of
something
much
more
narrow.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
ground
is
i
just
simply
believe
that
the
guidelines'
recommendation
for
arson
when
there
are
people
in
the
building
is
simply
too
low?
okay?
you
give
notice
of
that.
what
good
is
giving
notice
of
that
going
to
do?
is
too
low.
isn't
too
low.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
almost,
you
know,
a
determination
of
the
judge's
gut
feeling
of
what
is
condign
punishment
for
a
particular--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
a
lot
of
cases,
though,
it
will
be
impossible
for
judges
to
make
their
determination
the
night
before,
take
home
the
pre-sentence
report,
and,
you
know,
stuff
from
the
trial
and
focus
on
the
next
morning's
sentencing
hearing.
