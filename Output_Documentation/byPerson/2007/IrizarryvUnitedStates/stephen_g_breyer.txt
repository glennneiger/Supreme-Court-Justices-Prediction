stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is
the
32(h)
obligation
relevant?
that
is,
looking
through
the
history
of
it,
i
see
that
in
32(i)(c)
it
says
that
the
government
has
to
allow
the
parties'
attorneys
to
comment
on
the
determination
of
the
probation
officer
and
other
matters
relating
to
an
appropriate
sentence.
then,
in
a
case
called
burns
v.
united
states,
this
court
says
that
that
right
to
comment
includes
a
right
to
notice.
and
so
all
that
32(h)
did
was
to
take
what
was
already
the
law
and
make
specific
that
it
includes
a
right
to
notice.
i
take
it
that
was
what
they
were
up
to.
but
even
if
you
didn't
have
32(h),
you
would
have
precisely
the
same
right
once
you
got
32(i)(c)
together
with
the
case
of
burns.
so
i
don't
know
where
that
leaves
me,
except
thinking
it
doesn't
matter,
because
the
defendant
has
precisely
the
same
right
either
way.
and
i
guess
it's
easier
just
to
say
"departure"
means
generally
all
kinds
of
departures
including
not
applying
it.
that's
not
a
stretch
of
the
language.
it
is
quite
right
it
is
not
consistent
with
what
they
thought
they
were
up
to,
but
not...
it
is...
maybe
before...
if
they
had
passed
this
before
hawaii
became
a
state,
you
could
say:
well,
they
didn't
think
it
would
apply
in
hawaii.
so
what?
i
mean
would
you
address
that,
general?
