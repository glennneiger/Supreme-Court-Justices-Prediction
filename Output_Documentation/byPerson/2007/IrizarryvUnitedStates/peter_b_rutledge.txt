mr.
peter
b.
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
has
before
it
today
two
alternative
grounds
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
the
first
is
suggested
by
justice
ginsburg
and
chief
justice
roberts
that
paragraph
78
of
the
presentence
report
put
the
parties
on
adequate
notice
that
they
could
engage
in
a
full
adversarial
testing
outweighing
the
defendant's
future
dangerousness
against
his
amenability
to
alternative
methods
of
treatment.
the
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
judgment
below
is
that
suggested
by
justice
scalia
and
justice
alito,
namely:
that
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
32(h)
was
drafted
for
a
different
era,
an
era
of
mandatory
guidelines.
and
there
is
no
reason,
particularly
in
light
of
the
right
rulemaking
process,
to
extend
rule
32
to
an
advisory
guideline
era.
mr.
peter
b.
rutledge
justice
ginsburg,
i
understand
your
concern
about
the
possibility
that
district
judges
might,
i
guess
in
theory,
attempt
to
do
an
end
run
around
rule
32(h)
by
recasting
a
departure
decision
as
a
variance
decision.
and,
admittedly,
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
the
ground
for
a
departure
on
rule
32(h)
has
some
overlap
with
the
ground
for
a
variance
under
3553(a),
but
i
would
offer
several
responses.
my
first
response
is
that
i
feel
the
court
crossed
that
bridge
a
little
bit
in
the
booker
remedial
opinion
when
it
created
an
advisory
guidelines
system.
the
whole
premise
of
the
advisory
guidelines
system
was
to
enhance
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge.
my
second
answer
would
be
that
district
judges
still
have
a
reason
to
engage
in
the
departure
calculation.
as
this
court
made
clear
in
rita,
district
judges
must
begin
by
consulting
the
guidelines.
and
the
second,
third,
fifth,
sixth,
eighth,
and
tenth
courts
of
appeal
all
have
interpreted
that
obligation
to
consult
the
guidelines
to
include
consideration
of
possible
grounds
for
departure.
of
course,
this
court's
decision
in
kimbrough
made
clear
that
even
if
those
two
grounds
don't
provide
the
judge
adequate
incentive
to
engage
in
a
departure
calculation,
that
there
is
yet
another
reason;
and
that
is
because
it
may
affect
the
scrutiny-of-reasonableness
review.
as
the
court
explained
in
kimbrough,
when
a
district
judge
departs
from
the
guidelines,
the
district
judge's
determination
may
be
entitled
to
greater
respect
when
the
judge
makes
the
determination
that
a
case
takes...
that
a
circumstance
takes
the
case
outside
of
the
heartland.
mr.
peter
b.
rutledge
justice
alito,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court's
booker
and
post-booker
jurisprudence
has
made
the
departure
determination
irrelevant.
indeed,
just
this
last
friday,
the
sentencing
commission
posted
on
its
website
additional
proposed
amendments
to
the
sentencing
guidelines
that
would
inject
new
grounds
for
departures
including
fraud
for
emergency
assistance
and
violations
of
federal
food
and
drug
laws
that
entail
a
risk
of
serious
bodily
injury.
departures
remain
relevant
to
the
guidelines
because
they
are
the
basis
upon
which
the
commission
can
continue
to
fulfill
its
mandate
to
provide
for
the
type
of
uniform
sentencing
that
still
is
possible.
mr.
peter
b.
rutledge
well,
it
may
well
be
the
case,
justice
alito,
that
as
this
court's
booker
jurisprudence
unfolds,
that
the
concept
of
a
departure
declines
in
importance,
in
addition
with
respect
to
the
32(h)
obligation
for
notice.
mr.
peter
b.
rutledge
certainly,
justice
breyer.
if
we
were
to
put
32(h)
to
one
side
and
consider
the
effect
of
rule
32(i)(1)(c),
then
the
court
confronts
the
question
whether
the
basic
ideas
that
animated
its
decision
in
burns
should
be
extended
in
an
advisory-guidelines
era.
and
burns,
at
bottom,
rested
on
two
distinct
strands
of
reasoning.
one
was
the
question
of
unfair
surprise.
and
we
think,
with
that
respect,
that
the
post-booker
era
is
different
from
the
pre-booker
era.
and
the
reason
why,
justice
breyer,
is
because
pre-booker
the
parties
came
to
the
sentencing
hearing
with
an
expectation
of
a
within-guidelines
sentence.
and
post-booker,
particularly
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
rita,
the
parties
cannot
come
to
the
sentencing
hearing
with
that
expectation
because
the
district
judge
may
not
presume
the
reasonableness
of
the
within-guidelines
sentence.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
burns
rested
on
concerns
of
unfair
surprise,
the
rationale
has
dropped
out
after
booker.
now,
there
is
a
second
strand
of
reasoning
to
burns
which
justice
ginsburg
alluded
to,
which
is
this
question
of
full
adversarial
testing.
and
i
agree
with
you,
chief
justice
roberts,
that
chief
judge
boudin's
decision
in
the
vega-santiago
case
provides
the
pathway
here.
judges
engage
in
this
kind
of
discretionary
act
all
the
time.
parties
come
to
the
hearing
with
a
theory,
a
theory
of
how
the
judge
should
exercise
her
sentencing
discretion
within
a
known
range,
and
knowing
the
applicable
legal
criteria,
and
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and
we
believe
that,
particularly
in
light
of
the
recent
amendment
to
section
32(d)(2)(f),
that's
going
to
include
the
possibility
of
the
3553
factors...
3553,
a
factor
in
the
presentence
report,
that
the
parties
are
going
to
have
the
opportunity
to
come
to
the
hearing
with
the
ability
to
engage
in
full
adversarial
testing.
mr.
peter
b.
rutledge
i
accept
the
first
part
of
that
premise,
chief
justice
roberts:
that
they
are
may
be
rare
cases
of
truly
unfair
surprise.
what
i
don't
necessarily
accept
is
that
notice
has
to
be
the
straitjacketed
remedy
for
district
judges
in
all
of
those
instances.
there
may
be
other
mechanisms
such
as
if
the...
if
the
fact
is,
if
you
will,
sprung
on
the
parties
in
the
midst
of
the
hearing,
a
motion
for
a
continuance,
as
the
government
indicates
on
page
44
of
its
brief,
may
be
a
mechanism
to
control
against
those
cases
of
truly
unfair
surprise.
and
then
a
court
of
appeals
under
this
court's
decision
in
pickett,
reviewing
the
appropriateness
of
granting
or
denying
the
continuance,
can
base
its
appellate
review
on
whether
or
not
unfair
surprise--
mr.
peter
b.
rutledge
--that
is
an
abuse
of
discretion--
mr.
peter
b.
rutledge
--i...
i
don't
think
that
it
presents
a
concern
of
impracticability,
justice
kennedy,
for
one
simple
reason;
and
that
is
by
relying
on
a
mechanism
such
as
the
continuance,
the
parties
are
given
the
opportunity
to
identify
for
the
court
whether
or
not
there's
a
concern
of
unfair
surprise;
and
if
there
is,
the
district
judge
is
in
the
position
to
decide
whether
or
not
she
believes
that
the
continuance
is
necessary.
if
the
notice
claim
only
arises
at
the
time
that
the
sentence
is
entered,
there's
relatively
little
opportunity
at
that
point
for
the
district
judge
to
go
back
and
reconsider
the
record
on
the
basis
of
unfair
surprise.
and
that
sort
of
takes
me
to
the
basic
point
that
justices
souter,
alito
and
justice
ginsburg
all
talk,
about
which
is
the
fundamental
unworkability
of
the
notice
rule
and
advisory
guidelines
system.
as
the
judges...
the
district
judges
explained
to
us
in
the
recent
rulemaking
proceeding
contemplating
a
amendment
to
rule
32(h),
they're
concerned
that
extending
this
rule
to
variances
will
make
it
quite
difficult.
we
know
that
district
judges
often
receive
these
packets
of
sentencing
information
only
seven
days
before
the
sentencing
hearing.
several
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
giving
notice
at
the
sentencing
hearing
is
not
timely.
and
even
if
the
timeliness
concern
can
be
overcome,
there
are
serious
problems
in
workability
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
notice.
the
best
that
the
petitioner
and
the
government
the
instruct
this
court
on,
in
terms
of
how
the
adequacy
standard
is
going
to
work,
is
that
it
has
to
be
context-specific;
and
if
we
put
ourselves
in
the
shoes
of
a
district
judge
that
now
has
to
engage
in
a
discretionary
act
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
notice
that
i've
given
is
adequate
turns
on
the
context,
doesn't
provide
a
great
deal
of
guidance
to
the
district
judge.
we
know,
for
example--
mr.
peter
b.
rutledge
--i...
certainly,
justice
ginsburg.
and
i've
wrestled
with
that
own
question
in...
in
my
mind.
if
this
judge
were
to
have
said
i'm
thinking
of
sentencing
outside
the
guidelines
because
i'm
dealing
with
an
individual
who
has
a
demonstrated
ability
to
stalk
and
threaten
his
ex-wife,
would
that
have
been
adequate?
and
interestingly,
i
think
pages
23
and
126
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
illustrate
that
either
the
answer
to
that
question
is
going
to
be
"not
necessarily",
or
otherwise
appellate
judges
are
going
to
be
strung
up
having
to
unpack
whether
or
not
notice
is
adequate,
because
it
is
petitioner's
petition
in
this
case
that
even
if
the
defendant
had
been
put
on
notice
as
to
the
future
dangerousness,
that
that
did
not,
quote,
"put
the
defendant
on
notice"
that
the
district
judge
supposed
the
futility
of
treatment
might
justify
an
outside-the-guidelines
sentencing.
here's
the
essential
workability
problem.
we
know
from
this
court's
decision
in
rita
that
the
basic
vision
in
the
post-booker
world
is
to
encourage
judges
to
provide
reasoned
sentencing
decisions,
where
a
degree
of
reasoning
may
depend
a
little
bit
upon
whether
the
judge
is
engaging
an
inside-the-advisory-guidelines
sentence,
or
an
outside-the-advisory-guidelines
sentence.
in
the
event
that
a
district
judge
engaging
in
an
outside-the-guidelines
sentence,
she
is
now
walking
into
a
trap.
because
if
she
imposes
it
based
on
a
determination
about
the
defendant's
future
dangerousness,
and
then
in
an
attempt
to
provide
a
full
explication
of
her
reasoning
makes
a
statement
about
the
amenability
or
non-amenability
of
the
defendant
to
alternative
forms
of
treatment,
the
aggrieved
party
will
seize
on
that
extra
statement
and
bring
it
back
to
the
pre-sentencing
report
and
the
parties'
pleadings
and
said
we
may
have
had
notice
as
to
ground
one
to
the
variance
but
we
didn't
have
notice
as
to
ground
two.
or
we
may
have
had
notice
as
to
ground
one
and
two,
but
we
didn't
have
any
as
to
ground
three.
this
is
the
essentially
workability
concern
that
we
believe
that
the
district
judges
raised
when
they
expressed
their
discomfort
with
the
proposed
amendments
to
rule
32(h);
and
precisely
why
we
think
the
more
prudent
course
is
to
affirm
the
judgment
below,
either
on
the
narrow
ground
that
i
started
start
with,
the
chief
justice's
question
suggested,
or
alternatively
on
the
broader
grounds
suggested
by
justice
scalia's
questions,
that
the
resume
that
emerged
at
the
time
of
mandatory
guidelines
should
not
be
extended
to
the
time
of
advisory
guidelines.
and
if
i
could
make
one
last
observation,
and
then
i'll
complete
my
argument
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
in
december
of
2007,
the
advisory
committee
on
criminal
rules
formed
a
subcommittee
to
study
this
problem.
if
the
court
consults
the
minutes
of
that
meeting,
they
didn't
form
that
subcommittee
because
they
were
awaiting
this
court's
decision
in
irizarry.
they
formed
that...
cert
hadn't
been
granted
in
irizarry.
they
formed
that
subcommittee
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
was
whether
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions
in
gall
and
kimbrough
a
notice
requirement
was
still
necessary;
and
second
was
the
consideration
that
in
light
of
the
breadth
of
the
3553(a)
factors
a
notice
requirement
should
be
removed
altogether.
the
more
prudent
course
either
for
the
narrow
grounds
suggested
by
chief
justice
roberts
or
the
broader
grounds
suggested
by
justice
scalia
is
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i
would
be
happy
to
yield
back
the
balance
of
my
time.
