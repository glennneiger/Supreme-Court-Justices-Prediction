mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
rule
32
requires
the
district
court
to
provide
notice
before
any
departure
from
the
guidelines
range
based
on
a
ground
not
previously
identified
by
the
psr
of
the
parties,
including
a
departure
based
on
the
factors
in
section
3553(a).
non-guideline
sentences
under
section
3553(a)
fall
squarely
within
the
term
departure,
both
as
defined
in
the
dictionary
and
as
defined
in
the
guidelines.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
first
of
all,
as
enacted
rule
32(h)
requires
notice
of
all
deviations
from
the
guidelines
range,
and
by
its
plain
terms
it
continues
to
do
that.
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--either
way--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
they
were
focused
on
guidelines
authorized
departures
because
those
were
the
only
ones
that
were
legally
authorized
at
the
time.
but
the
fact
is
that
they
required
notice
of
all...
that...
that...
that
they
were
requiring
notice
of
all
deviations
that
were
available.
now
they
should
require
notice...
at
a
minimum,
rule
32(h)
is
still
there
and
it
continues
to
apply
to
traditional
departures.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
it--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
yes.
one
of
the...
they
have,
your
honor.
one
of
the
things
that
the
advisory
committee
stated
that
it
was
going
to
consider
was...
was
lower
court
decisions
on
the
question...
on
the
question
of
whether
notice...
the
current
text
of
rule
32(h)
requires
notice
to
be
given.
so
that
might
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
that
some
people
in
the
conference
were
reluctant
to
adopt
an
amendment.
another
reason
was
that
they
knew
that
the
courts
were
considering
the
question,
and
many
people
expressed
concern
that
an
amendment
was
premature,
that
the...
that
the
conference
should
await
further
guidance
from
the
courts
and
from
this
court.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
true.
some
judges
did
object
to
that.
but
others...
as
i
said,
there
were
other...
some
judges
expressed
support
for
that
interpretation,
and
there
were
varying
reasons
that
were
motivating
different
people
in
the
conference
to
take
the
position
that
the
conference
should
wait.
the
fact
is...
and
so
the
court
shouldn't
construe
from
the
failure
to
enact
an
amendment
just
like
the
court
is
reluctant
to
construe
from
the
failure
to
amend
a
statute
that
the
current
provision
doesn't
require
notice.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
so,
because
they've...
they've
referred
it
back
to
the
subcommittee
and
said
they
want
to
wait
and
see
what...
what
this
court
does
and
what
the
courts
to.
so,
they're
waiting
for
you.
doesn't
seem
like
in
that
circumstance
it
makes
sense
for
you
to
wait
for
them.
but
however
you
interpret
the
current
rule...
and
the
question
before
you
is
what
the
current
rule
requires.
however
you
interpret
that
it
doesn't
circumvent
the
rulemaking
process--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no.
i
think
that
the
pre-sentence
report
doesn't
actually
have
to
recommend
it.
the
pre-sentence
report...
and
they
generally
have
a
section
that
does
this
although,
although
often
they
don't
identify--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
mean,
at
a
certain
point
it
wouldn't,
but
if
it
listed
more
than
one
as
a
possible
ones
and
they
were
identified
with
sufficient
specificity
to
enable--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
it...
it...
it
certainly
could,
your
honor.
and
the
psr
here
includes--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
required.
no.
but
what...
what
it
does
show
is
that
this
is
a
possibility
that
an
out
of
guidelines
sentence
is
a
possibility
and
this
is
the
ground
on
which
it
is
a
possibility.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
parties
can--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
parties...
the
parties
would
be
able
to
focus
on
that
and
try
to
inform
the
judge's
decision
on
that.
but
that's
not
the
only
kind
of...
that's
not
the
only
kind
of
ground
on
which
a
court
might
vary,
and
that
may
not
be
one
for
which
advance
notice
would
be
particularly
helpful,
but
there
are
many
on
which
it
is.
if
i
can
give
an
example
of
a
case
we
recently
confronted,
for
example?
we
had
a
case
in
which
a
judge
imposed
probation
on
a
defendant
who
was
convicted
of
soliciting
child
pornography
because
the
judge
was
under
the
belief
that
prison
couldn't
provide
the
necessary
treatment.
we
hadn't
presented
any
evidence
on
available
treatment
programs,
but
we
certainly
would
have
done
that
if
we
had
had
notice
that
the
court
was
contemplating
varying
on
that
ground.
and
because
we
didn't
do
that,
there
was
no
adversary
presentation
of
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
could...
we
could
certainly
do
that.
but
that's
an
after
the...
you
know,
that
would
be
an
after-the-fact
situation.
what...
what
rule
32
is
trying
to
do
is
set
up
a
procedure
so
that
in
every
case,
in
every
case
you
get
the
adversarial
presentation
on
the
grounds--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
it's...
it's
a
context-specific
question.
the
question
is,
is
the
notice
reasonable,
which
means
it
has
to
give
the
parties
enough
time
to
present
the
adversarial
process
on
the
question.
now,
in
the
vast
majority,
all
but
the
most
unusual
cases
notice
a
day
or
two
in
advance
would
be
specific.
and
in
many
cases,
notice
that
the
hearing
itself
would
be
sufficient.
i
think
in
this
case,
for
example,
notice
that
the
hearing
itself
would
certainly
have
been
sufficient;
but...
but
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
several
reasons;
for
all
the
reasons,
your
honor,
that
we
said
that
the...
that
it's
failure
to
give
notice
of
a
variance
here
was
harmless.
first
of
all,
the
psr
had
already
identified
a
possible
departure
on
a
very
similar
ground.
second
of
all,
the
petitioner's
future
dangerousness
was
central
to
the
victim
impact
testimony
of
his
wife
who
had
notice
was
going
to
testify.
he
knew
from
the
psr
what
she
was
going
to
say.
in
addition,
it
was
central
to
dispute...
potential
adjustment
to
the
guidelines'
range.
so,
his
future
dangerousness
was--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
but
i
think
in
this
circumstance,
for
example,
there
would
be...
another
example
would
be
often
if
the
victim
impact
testimony...
there
hadn't
been
identified
as
a
potential
ground
for
departure
on
it,
but
the
judge
heard
victim
impact
testimony,
but
the
defendant
knew
the
victim
was
going
to
testify,
had
the
general
sense
it
and
the
judge
when
it
heard...
when
she
heard
it
decided,
wow,
you
know,
this
really
makes
me
think
i
should
take
it
out
of
the
sentence,
i
think
that
because
the...
because
the
defendant
knew
that
the
testimony
was
going
to
be
there,
knew
the
gist
of
it
and
was
prepared
to
respond
to
it,
would
probably
be
sufficient
to
give
notice
at
that
time
then.
for
instance,
if
the
judge
relied
on
remorse
in
allocution...
lack
of
remorse
in
allocution
that's
another
example
where
i
think,
you
know,
notice
at
the
hearing
would
pretty
much--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
judges...
judge
scalia:...
decide
it
a
week
in
advance.
do
judges
do
that,
decide
a
week
in
advance?
i
doubt
it.
the
judges
are
reviewing
the
material.
i
don't
think
they
are
doing
it
a
week
in
advance.
they're
getting
the
material
a
week
in
advance.
they
are
reviewing
it
before
the
sentencing
hearings.
and
the
notice
requirement
has
not
been
unduly
burdensome
for
traditional
departures--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
they
don't--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that...
it
is
true
that
they
go
into
the
hearing
with
an
open
mind,
but
it's
also
true
that
before
the
hearing,
they're
going
to
have
some
sense
based
on
the
written
materials
that
they've
reviewed
and
based
on
the
parties'
identifications
of
what
they
think
the
appropriate
sentence
is.
as
petitioner's
counsel
explained,
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
the
psr,
the
parties
are
already
going
to
identify
the
potential
grounds
for
a
variance,
and
so
it's
very
few
cases
that
there's
going
to
be
a
ground
that's
going
to
come
out--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
at
a
minimum,
the
court
would
have
to
identify
the
relevant
3553(a)
factor.
i
think
then
what
more
is
required
depends
a
little
bit
on
the
particular
factor,
the
record
in
the
case.
again,
the
test
is
to
ensure
that
they
focus
adversarial
presentation.
if
it's
a
really
an
open-ended
factor,
like
the
nature
and
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
the
defendant's
characteristics,
obviously
more
is
going
to
be
required.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
here
i
think
it
would
have
been
sufficient
for
the
judge
to
say.
i'm
contemplating
a
variance
under
section
3553(a)(2)(c),
based
on
the
fact
that
petitioner's
conduct
indicates
that
he
is
likely
to
commit
future
crimes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
we
don't
think
that
notice
of
the
specific
fact
on
which
the
court
is
going
to
rely
is
required.
that
would
start
to
make
the
notice
requirement
unworkable,
but
i
don't
think
that's
how
it's
been
interpreted,
to
require
the
very
specific
facts
in
the
departure
context.
the
same
situation,
the
parallel
thing
applies
here.
as
i
was
going
to
say
before
on
the
burdensomeness,
it
hasn't
been
burdensome,
unduly
burdensome,
to
require
notice
for
traditional,
and
there
really
isn't
any
reason
to
think
that
it
would
be
different
for
here.
and
to
get
back
to
something
earlier
as
well
that
we're
were
talking
about,
the
key
fact
is
rule
32(h)
does
indisputably
require
notice
for
traditional
departures.
and
a
notice
requirement
for
variances
is
essential
to
prevent
evisceration
of
that
notice
requirement
because
a
court
can
always
impose
the
same...
use
a
variance
to
impose
the
same
sentence
that
it
could
have
imposed
as
a
guidelines
departure.
so
that
notice
requirement,
which
is
still
in
the
rule,
is
going
to
basically
become
meaningless
unless
the
word
"departure"
is
given
it
full
scope
and
construed
to
include
variances.
and
notices
of
variances
is
also
necessary
for
the
focused
adversarial
testing
that
rule
32
requires
for
the
reason
the
court
said
in
burns.
if
the
parties
don't
know
what
the
potential
grounds
for
a
non-guidelines
sentence
are,
then
what
they're
likely
to
do
is
either
address
the
possibility
of
an
above-guidelines
sentence
in
a
random
and
wasteful
way
by
trying
to
conceive
of
every
possible
grounds
or
they're
just
not
going
to
address
it
at
all,
like
in
the
example
that
i
gave
before
when
we
just
didn't
address
the
potential
variance
based
on
prison
not
providing...
being
able
to
provide
the
appropriate
treatment.
and
it's
still
important,
even
after
booker,
to
have
adversarial
testing
of
that
issue.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
what
we
would
have
liked
to
do
is
bring
in
people
to
explain
to
the
judge
these
are
the
programs
that
are
available.
this
is--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
how
it
works.
well,
i
think
the
lawyer
probably
could
have
said
we
have...
we
have
treatments
and
they
work.
but
then
the
judge
said--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
based
on
this--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
think
that
what
the
judge
thought
was
that
there
were
no
available
treatments
that
would
work.
and
it--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that...
you
know,
it
might
have
dissuaded
the
judge
there,
but
it
didn't
give
us
the
opportunity
to
bring
in
somebody
who--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--who
knows
how
it...
you
know,
who
knows
what
the
programs
are,
to
explain
it.
whatever
the
judge
said,
yes,
i
know
you
have
these
programs,
but
the
programs
that
you
can
do
in
prison...
you
know,
i
just
don't
think
that
those
are
effective.
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
judge
is...
you
know,
counsel
can
make
the
argument.
but
in
certain
cases,
the
ability
to
present
actual
evidence
on
it
is
going
to
be
an
important...
is
going
to
be
an
important
factor.
there's,
you
know,
other
examples:
for
instance,
if
the
judge
varies
on
grounds
that
there's
no
treatment
available
for
other
things
or
that
people
have
been
permanently
psychologically
scarred,
and
the
other
side
wants
to
bring
forward
counter-evidence
and
testimony.
there
are
numerous
ones.
that's
the...
that's
the
essence
of
what
the
requirement--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--and
the
rules
get
at.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
judges...
do
judges
bring
in
experts?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
would
have...
if...
i
think
that
we
would...
could
bring
in
someone
and
testify
about...
to
present
evidence
on
that
for
sure,
if
the
judge
was
thinking
of
imposing
probation
because
there
was
no
treatment
program.
it
wouldn't
have
to
go
on
for
very
long,
but
we
could
have
someone
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
and...
and
do
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
not
routinely,
but,
you
know,
generally
that's
not
an
issue.
that's
why
we
didn't
do
it
in
this...
in
this
particular
sentencing
hearing.
the
point
is
that,
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
do
that.
and
so
a
judge
that's
operating
under
that
and
it's
going
to
vary
on
that
ground
isn't
going
to
get
that
information
because
we're...
as
you
say...
we're
not
going
to
just
want
to
delay
all
the
hearings
for
that
reason.
and
so
that...
it's
really
the
reason
that
the
requirement
in
the
existing
rule
is
there,
and
the
reasons
behind
that
apply
with
equal
force
in
the
variance
context.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes...
i
mean,
it's
not
the
best...
it's
not
the
best
example
to
illustrate
to
the
court
why
notice
is
required
because
here
we
do
think
that
the
error
was
harmless
for
various
reasons.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
we
think
the
court
should,
you
know,
first
obviously
address
the
rule
32
question
on
which
it
granted
certain
certiorari,
but
after
doing
that,
we
think
the
court
should
address
the
harmless
error
question
because
that
will
provide
useful
guidance
to
the
lower
courts.
there
are
likely
to
be
a
lot
of
harmless
error
cases
because
half
of
the
circuits
have
erroneously
concluded
that
the
rule
doesn't
require
notice,
and
they
could
benefit
from
an
illustration
of
how
to
apply
it
in
this
particular
context--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--involving
variance.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
think
this
is
an
easy
case
for
an
appellate
court
to
address
because--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--regarding
whether
the
notice
would
be
adequate--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
but
the
questions
about
adequacy
of
notice
are
really
no
different
in
kind
than
the
same
questions
that
come
up
for
the
traditional
departure
rule.
it's
still
going
to
be
there,
however
this
court
resolves
the
case
for
the
notice
of
guidelines
departures.
so
i
don't
think
that
you're
opening
a...
whole
new
questions
about
adequacy,
just
as
like
you're
not
opening
up
a
whole
set
of
new
questions
about
timing.
those
questions
are
there,
and
the
courts
are
going
to
have
to
confront
them.
but
in
discussing
the
harmlessness
issue
here,
you
could
shed
some
light
on
those
questions
that
can
provide
some
guidance
for
the
lower
courts
that
will
be
useful
to
them
in
the
future.
and
we
would
urge
you
to
do
that.
turning
to
the
harmlessness,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
psr
gave
notice...
do
you
want
me
to
continue?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
sure.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
future
dangerousness
was
central
to
sentencing,
it's
also
true
that
the
evidence
that
petitioner
now
says
he
wouldn't
have
presented
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference
because
his
counsel
essentially
made
the
same
argument
to
the
district
court,
and
he
could
have
used
the
expert
testimony
to
support
that
argument,
but
he
chose
not
to.
the
district
court
had
already
rejected
the
defense
of
expert
diagnosis
the
petitioner
was
delusional
and
could
be
treated
with
anti-psychotic
drugs
and
adopted
the
government
expert's
diagnosis
that
petitioner
had
a
personality
disorder
that
was
longstanding
and
unlikely
to
change.
