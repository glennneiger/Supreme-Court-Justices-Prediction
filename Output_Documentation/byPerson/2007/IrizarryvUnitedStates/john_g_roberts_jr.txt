chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-7517,
irizarry
versus
united
states.
mr.
madden.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
may
not
have
had
notice
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
an
alternative
procedure
and
medication
audit
would
help,
but
you
certainly
knew
that
future
dangerousness
was
going
to
be
on
the
table.
and
if
you
had
a
response
to
that,
which
is,
well,
if
he
took
his
medication,
it
wouldn't
be
a
problem,
i
assume
you
would
have
prepared
for
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yeah,
i...
but
in
terms
of
what
issues
might
suggest
themselves
to
a
judge
sentencing
this
particularly
defendant,
i
would
have
thought
future
dangerousness.
i
mean,
you
have
an
individual
who
has
leveled
particular
threats
with
some
degree
of
certainty
that
he
intends
to
pursue
them,
i
would
have
thought
that
would
have
been
one
of
the
first
things
a
sentencing
judge
would
look
at.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
defendant
have
an
obligation
to
give
notice,
both
to
the
government
and
i
suppose
to
the
judge,
saying
at
the...
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
we're
going
to
say
this?
so
the
judge
can
get
ready
for
it?
or
the
government
can
get
ready
for
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
point
made
by
chief
judge
boudin
in
his
recent
opinion,
is
that
now
that
we
look
more
carefully
at
the
3553
factors,
counsel
has
to
come
in
prepared
to
address
all
of
those?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
rules
advisory
committee
is
currently
considering
whether
or
not
to
change
this,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
nobody
in
that
process
has
suggested,
well,
it's
too
bad
you've
already
decided
this
in
32(h)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
lot
of
judges
objected
to
the
idea
they
would
adopt
the
position
you're
urging
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
inferring
from
the
failure
to
act.
it
is
just
a
recognition
that
these
things
are
looked
at
very
carefully
by
the
rules
committees
and
they
look
at
it
in
a
broad
way
and
take
in
all
the
information.
we
know
they're
doing
that
now.
and
we
would
be
kind
of
jumping
the
gun
and
short
circuiting
that
process.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
that
be?
they're
talking
about
an
expert
and
all
that.
he's
not
going
to
be
hanging
around
the
courthouse.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
all
goes...
that
all
goes
to
the
harmless
error
question.
is
that
the
only
time
in
which
notice
at
the
sentencing
hearing
is
going
to
be
adequate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you're
really
asking
them
to
sentence
first
and
hearing
afterward.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
the
whole
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
to
find
out
what
factors
are
pertinent
and
all
that.
you're
asking
the
judge
to
come
to
that
determination
before
the
hearing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
disagree
with
the
petitioner
on
the
specificity
of
notice
required?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you
think
you
have
a
particularly
good
case
that
they
are,
again
you
make
that
point
to
the
judge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
can
see
what
the
last
report
about
these
programs
was
like,
you
wouldn't
think
that.
and
i
think
a
reasonably
competent
judge
is
not
going
to
say,
i
don't
want
to
see
it.
or
maybe
he
will
based
on
his
own
experience
in
dealing
with
those
types
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
suppose
we'll
have--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
suppose
we'll
have
a
lot
of
appeals
about
the
adequacy
of
the
notice.
you
and
the
petitioner
disagree
on
that,
and
appellate
courts
will
have
to
address
that
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
this
may
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
this
may
be
an
easy
case,
but
you
can
imagine
others
that
aren't
going
to
be.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
continue.
finish.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rutledge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
accept
chief
judge
boudean's
safety
valve
as
well?
in
other
words,
if
the
basis
for
the
variance
is
going
to
be
a
matter
of
surprise,
then
notice
is
required?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
madden,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
rutledge,
you
briefed
and
argued
the
case
as
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
judgment
below
upon
appointment
by
this
court,
and
we
thank
you
for
undertaking
and
discharging
that
assignment.
the
case
is
submitted.
