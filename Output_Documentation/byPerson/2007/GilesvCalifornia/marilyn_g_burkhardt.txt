ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
crawford
this
court
made
clear
that
in
order
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
confrontation
clause
we
look
to
the
common
law
and
particularly
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
framing.
and,
as
we
have
shown
in
our
briefs,
the...
california's
forfeiture
rule
did
not
exist
in
common
law.
it
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
the
framing.
and
the
common-law
concept
that
is
embodied
in
the
confrontation
clause
has
grave,
practical
importance
to
defendants,
and
particularly
to
the
defendant
in
this
case,
because
the
application
of
this
new
forfeiture
rule
that
california
created
deprived
the
petitioner
of
his
right
to
present
a
fair
claim
of
self-defense.
basically,
the
statement
that
was
admitted
accused
the
petitioner
of
having
viciously
attacked
miss
avie
and
having
threatened
her
at
knifepoint
and
having
threatened
to
kill
her.
and
the
admission
of
this
statement,
which
he
never
had
a
chance
to
cross-examine
or
attempt
a
cross-examination,
obviously
was
highly
prejudicial
because
it
indicated
to
the
jury
that
he
was
planning
to
kill
her.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the...
her
statement
came
in,
in
the
prosecution's
case-in-chief.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
yes.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
the
difference
is
that
his
statements
about
her
went
solely
to
his
state
of
mind.
they
did
not
come
in
for
their
truth,
but
her
statements
came
in
for
their
truth.
so
it
really
isn't
an
apples-and-oranges
comparison.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
indeed,
of
course.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
exactly.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
he
did
indicate
that
he
was
going
to
present
a
claim
of
self-defense,
and
i
believe
he
indicated
that
he
was
going
to
testify.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
fact
that
it
was
a
self-defense
claim
is
irrelevant.
this
testimony
would
have
come
in...
her
testimony
or
hearsay
statements
would
have
come
in
even
if
he
hadn't
presented
a
self-defense
claim.
it
just
was
a
coincidence
in
this
case.
and
california
claims
that
they
have
a
right
to
introduce
such
testimonial
statements
in
any
case
in
which
they
can
show
that
the
defendant
was
the
cause
of
the
witness's
absence.
i
mean
the
case--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--right.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
i
do.
it...
it
doesn't
really
go
to
any
of
the
claims--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--well,
the
injustice
here,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
he
doesn't
have
a...
any
meaningful
opportunity
to
contest
what
the
police
officer
says
she
said
because
he
never
had
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
her.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
not
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
it
goes
much
further;
and,
indeed,
the
state
has
not
cited
one
single
case
at
common
law
or
after
that
supports
its
view
that
this
rule
is
proper.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
yes.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
no.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
justice
breyer,
the
confrontation
clause
sets
forth
a
basic
policy,
which
is
that
we
are
to
have
live
testimony
in
court.
we
have
to
have
witnesses
available
in
court.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
in
crawford
this
court
said
we
do
look
to--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--well,
that's
sort
of...
that
sounds
like,
say,
the
situation
in
crawford
that--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--sets
forth
the
proper
contours,
which
is
that
any
exception
to
the
confrontation
clause
must
be
very,
very
narrow.
and
they
approved
an
exception
for
witness
tampering
which
is
deeply
embedded
in
the
common
law.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
your
honor--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--yes,
it
was.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
that
is
right.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
yes,
there
was.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
that's
correct.
but
the
dying
declaration...
the
fact
that
the
dying
declaration
rule
existed
with
its
very
specific
elements
shows
powerfully
that
no
general
rule
existed
such
as
the
california
rule,
because
if
the
california
rule
had
existed--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--because
the
forfeiture
rule
at...
which
is
a
separate...
entirely
a
separate
rule
of
common
law,
did
require
intent
to
prevent
testimony.
it
has
always
been
viewed
that
way
from
its
inception
in
lord
morley's
case--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--correct.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
that's
right.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
that's
right.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
correct.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
yes,
as
a
spouse.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
i'm
sorry?
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
in
crawford
it
was
a
spouse.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
that's
right.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
under...
under
crawford?
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
i
don't
think
it
was.
hearsay
was
absolutely
inadmissible.
and
there
were
just
very,
very
narrow
exceptions
under
the
common
law.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
of
course.
especially
in
the
case
of
an
unavailable
witness.
in
lord
morley's
case
they
set
forth
rules.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it
depends
on
whether
it
was
deemed
to
be
testimonial
or
not.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
it's
not
an
issue
in
our
case.
i
mean
perhaps.
i
mean
obviously,
as
you
point
out,
if
she
had
made
a
statement
to
a...
not
a
police
officer...
to
a
friend,
family
member,
or
whatever,
a
nontestimonial
statement,
then
that
probably
could
come
in.
but
what
is
at
issue
here--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--yes.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
the
courts--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--that
is--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--that's
perhaps
nontestimonial.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--well,
the
court
hasn't
fully
described
all
of
the
parameters
of
"testimonial".
but
our
case
does
not
involve
that
issue,
because
this
statement
is
clearly
testimonial.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
no,
not
necessarily.
i
think
it's
very
significant
that
the
court
of
appeals...
neither
the
california
supreme
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
engaged
in
a
harmless-error
analysis.
and
that
statement
that
you
quote
presupposed
that
the
testimonial
hearsay
statement
at
issue
was
a
large
factor
in
coming
to
that
conclusion.
so,
you
know,
no,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
that
really
went--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--no.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
no.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
there
was
a
specific
finding
of
fact
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
did
not
intend
to
kill
her...
he
did
not
kill
her
to
prevent
testimony.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
by,
you
know,
analyzing
the
evidence.
i
mean,
obviously,
there
are
many
ways,
and
perhaps
he
made
a
statement.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
that...
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
doesn't
make
an
awful
lot
of
sense
because
that
indicates
that
he
killed
her
in
order
to
prevent
her
from--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--well,
first
of
all,
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
found
that
he
did
not
kill
her
to
prevent
testimony.
the
california
supreme
court
basically
adopted
that
finding--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--and
the
state
never
challenged
it.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
the
courts
have
been...
federal
and
state
courts
have
been
making
that
factual
finding
for...
for
decades
under
the
federal
rule,
and
under
the
carlson
line
of
cases.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
correct.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
that's
highly
speculative.
there
was
no
proceeding.
there
was
no
indication
in
the
record
that...
that
her
assault
claim
was
ever
going
to
ripen
into
any
kind
of
criminal
proceeding
at
all.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
that
was--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--no.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
no.
that
is
the
common
law.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
the
hypothetical
assumes
something
which
is...
which
your
honor
admits
is...
is
simply
not
the
case.
i'm
going
to
suppose
assuming--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--that
it
was
there,
i
suppose
the
court
could...
could
rule
on
the
basis
of
that,
but
that
it's
definitely
not
the
case
and
has
never
been
the
case.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
i...
i
think
the
english
authorities
do
foreclose
it,
because
the
dying
declaration
cases,
and
there
are
dozens
of
them,
would
not
have
come
out
as
they
did
if
this
expansive
forfeiture
rule
had
existed.
it
would
make
no
sense.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
that's
right.
but
with
this...
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
this:
that
under
california's
theory,
if
the
defendant
is...
causes
the
absence
of
the
witness,
and
all
you
need
to
show
is
causation,
then
the
witness's
testimonial
statement
will
come
in;
but
under
the
dying
declaration
rule
mere
causation
is
not
sufficient.
you
have
to
also
show
other
factors
in
very...
particularly
that
the...
that
the
witness
was
aware
of
impending
death.
that
requirement
is
totally
superfluous
under
the
california
theory;
and
yet
it...
the
fact
that
no
lawyer
or
no
judge
for
hundreds
of
years
ever
suggested
that
in
those
cases--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--they
are
just
murders.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
they
are
just
murders,
your
honor.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
the
ones
we
cite
are
murders
and
they
are
murder
cases
in
criminal
cases.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
you
know,
it
specifically
goes
to...
the
element
of
the
dying
declaration
is
that
the
statement
has
to
relate
to
the
specific
cause
of
the
death.
so
it
really
does.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
the
death
doesn't
have
to
be
imminent
specifically.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
but
the
perception
is...
the
declarant
has
to
believe--
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
--it
applies
powerfully
in
many,
many
instances
to
criminal
cases;
and
that
fact...
and
that
has
existed
for...
for
centuries...
shows
that
there
was
no
general
rule
that
all,
you
know,
needed
to
do
was
to
be
accused
of
murdering
the
victim;
because
otherwise
if
california
rule
had
existed,
there
would
be
no
need
to
make
this
other
showing
in
the
dying
declaration
cases.
and
in
many
cases,
as
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
and
as
the
nacdl
has
cited,
evidence...
important
evidence
was
kept
out.
testimonial
hearsay
accusations
were
kept
out...
from
the
victim
accusing
the
defendant
were
kept
out
because
they
didn't
meet
the
specific
requirements,
specifically
the
sense
of
impending
death.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
well,
not
under
the
common
law.
it
was...
it
was
one
rule
under
the
common
law.
it
was
only
later
that
it
operated
as
two
separate
rules
of
confrontation
and
a
hearsay
rule.
under
the
common
law
all
you
needed
to
show
was
the
dying
declaration,
then
it
was
admissible
for
all
purposes.
there
was
no
distinction
between
confrontation
and
hearsay
at
that
time.
and
so
therefore,
again...
it
just...
if
all
you
needed
to
show
was
that
the
defendant
caused
or
likely
caused
the
absence
or
killed
the
victim,
then
all
of
those
cases
went
the
wrong
way;
all
of
that
evidence,
the
victim's
accusations,
would
have
come
in...
automatically.
and
they
did
not
come
in;
in
case
after
case
we
have
showed
that.
we
have
cited
some
dozens
of
cases
that
show
that.
and
the
state
has
not
cited
even
one
single
case,
not
one,
which
shows
at
common
law
that
this
evidence
here
would
have
come
in.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
ms.
marilyn
g.
burkhardt
it
state
said
that
there
is
no
equity
on
the
side...
on
petitioner's
side,
and
that's
simply
not
true.
the
statement
is
a
testimony
statement;
under
crawford,
it
clearly
must
be
excluded;
and
for
the
reason
that
it
is...
you
know,
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
right
to
test
the
accuracy
of
that
statement
and
to
expose
its
falsity.
he
claims
the
statement
isn't
true;
and
under
crawford,
the...
the
framers
have
prescribed
a
categorical
procedural
rule
for
testing
whether
a
statement
is
reliable,
and
that's
the
right
to
confrontation;
and
he
was
deprived
of
that
right
and
this
in
turn
derived
him
of
fair...
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
the
framers
in
adopting
the
confrontation
clause
understood
its
parameters
to
include
certain
narrow
exceptions.
and
the
exception...
one
of
the
exceptions
was
a
witness
tampering
exception;
and
that
had
a
very
rational
basis,
because
what
it
meant,
in
essence,
is
if
the
defendant
is
going
to
act
against
the
criminal
trial
system
from
which
he
demands
and
requires
justice,
he
cannot
at
the
same
time
intentionally,
deliberately
manipulate
and
thwart
the
criminal
justice
system
by
preventing
the
appearance
of...
of
necessary
witnesses.
so
in
that
case,
when
he
does
something
of...
to
that
effect,
then
it's
fair,
it's
equitable
and
reasonable;
he
cannot
profit
from
his
own
wrong.
and
that
maxim
that
a
person
cannot
profit
from
his
own
wrong
was
meant
to
apply
to
that
situation.
it
wasn't
meant
to
apply
in
the
broad,
generalized,
amorphous
sense
that
the
state
suggests,
because
that
would
effectively
substitute
in
some
sort
of
amorphous
notions
for
reliability
of...
i'm
sorry,
fairness...
for
the
amorphous
notions
of
reliability
standard
that
this
court
just
rejected
by
overruling
roberts.
in
fact,
what's
happened
here
is
the
state
is
attempting
to
resuscitate
roberts
and
to
eviscerate
crawford;
and
it
is
no
accident
that
this
whole
issue
arose
after
crawford.
this
is
a
post-crawford
invention.
it
did
not
even
exist
before.
and
it's
not...
the
ink
on
crawford
was
barely
dry
before
the
supreme
court
of
kansas,
like
six
weeks
later,
enacted
this...
this
first
forfeiture-by-causation
rule;
and
then
a
number
of
states
such
as
california
followed,
and
they
all
cite
each
other
as
authority.
but
nothing
before,
because
nothing
before
existed.
and
when
this
court
in
crawford
said
we
accept
the
rule
of
forfeiture
by
wrongdoing,
we
submit
that
the
court
couldn't
possibly
have
meant
this
broad
standard
that
california
created,
because
it
did
not
exist
at
that
time.
we
suggest
that
what
this
court
meant,
as
it
indicated
in
davis,
is
the...
essentially
the
federal
rule
entitled
forfeiture
by
wrongdoing,
which
is
specifically
directed
to
witness
tampering.
and
that
said...
and
codifies,
as
this
court
said
in
davis,
the
doctrine
of
forfeiture
that
has
existed
at
the
common
law;
that
was...
that
has
been
understood
for
hundreds
of
years,
that
was
carried
forward
and
preserved
in
reynolds,
and
then
it
was
further
carried
forward
to
the
federal
rule.
that's
all
we
want.
we
want
the
rule
as
it
has
always
existed,
not
some
new
expanded
rule
that
the...
california
has
just
created
to
undermine
and
eviscerate
my
client's
rights
to
confrontation.
we
are
just
asking
for
a
fair
trial,
which
he
did
not
get.
and
the
notion
that
he
is
profiting.
well,
in
that
sense,
everyone
profits
from
the
confrontation
clause.
it
was
designed
to
protect
defendants
from
encroachment
on
the
state.
it
was
designed
to
provide
defendants
a
fair
trial.

yes.
it
could
go
back
to
a
harmless
error
question
or
perhaps
a
new
trial.
they
can
retrial...
retry
him.
they
have
plenty
of
evidence
on
which
to
retry
him
in
this
case.
this
is
why...
that's
all
we
are
asking
for,
a
fair
trial,
not
a
trial
under
a
brand-new
standard
which
they
concocted
for
the
purpose
of
eviscerating
crawford,
which
is
exactly
what
happened.
