justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
the
distinction
you're
drawing
at
the
present
time
or
at
least
since
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted.
we
have
two
regimes.
we
have
the
constitutional
condition
and
we
have
hearsay
rules.
justice

but
with
respect
to
the
common
law
as
it
stood
at
the
time
that
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted,
there
wasn't
such
a
distinction;
was
there?
in
other
words,
to
the
extent
that
the
confrontation
right
is
informed
by
the
common-law
antecedent,
the
common-law
antecedents
were
not
drawing
the
line
that
you
are
drawing;
were
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
that
is
the
case,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
haven't
answered
justice
scalia's
question.
because
justice
scalia's
question
says:
let's
just
talk
about
common-law
antecedents
for
a
moment;
and,
given
common-law
antecedents,
why
were
people
worried
about
the
consciousness
of
death
under
the
dying
declaration
rule
if
there
was
this
broader
rule
which
is
supposed
to
inform
our
understanding
of
the
confrontation
right,
which
would
have
let
it
in
simply
because
the
crime
had
forfeited
the
right
to
object.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
still
have
not
answered
his
question.
