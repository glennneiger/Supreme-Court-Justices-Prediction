justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
that
the
difference
is
that
his
statements
about
her
were
subject
to
cross-examination.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
her
statements
about
him
were
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
following
you.
is
there...
is
there
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
so
long
as
the
hearsay
is
brought
in,
in
rebuttal?
is
there
a
rebuttal
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
thinking
about
cambridge
and
not
england.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do
any
of
them
have
anything
to
do
with
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
besides
which,
the
question
that
justice
breyer
was
asking
was
already
answered
in
crawford;
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
case
from
which
he
dissented.
but
we
did
say
that
the
meaning
of
the
confrontation
clause
is
the
meaning
it
bore
when
the
people
adopted
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
instead
of
intent,
the
dying
declaration
rule
required
knowledge
by
the
declarant
that
the
declarant
was
about
to
die.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
evidence
of
truthfulness
was
apparently
that
the
person
was
about
to
enter
the
next
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
most
of
us
don't
lie
at
that
particular
moment.
whereas,
in
the
confrontation
clause
situation
you
have
a
totally
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
jumped
off
in
crawford,
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
thought
that
the
common
law
rule
is
that
you
have
to
have
rendered
the...
intentionally
rendered
the
witness
unavailable
with
regard
to
the
particular
trial
that's
before
the
court.
not
rendering
the
witness
unavailable
for
some
other
litigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
it
was
some
other
litigation
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
didn't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
didn't
put
it
in
those
very
words,
but
i
think
a
lot
of...
of
the
quotations
from
opinions
cited
by
your
friend
seemed
to
me
to
say
that.
but
why
don't
you
start
off
by
telling...
by
explaining
to
us
why
these
many
cases
excluded
the
dying
declaration
of
the
murdered
person
when...
if
it
could
not
be
shown
that
the
murdered
person
knew
when
the
declaration
was
made
that
he
or
she
was
dying?
if
the
rule
that
you're
announcing
was
the
rule
at
common
law,
all
of
those
would
have
come
in
because
that
declaration
said
this
defendant
killed
me.
and,
therefore,
it
would
have
been
true
in
all
of
those
cases
that
this
defendant
procured
the
absence
of
the
witness
from
the
trial.
how
do
you
explain
that.
and
there
are
many
cases.
it's
not
just
a
few.
the
requirement
in
the
dying
declaration
cases
that
the...
that
the
declarant
be
aware
of
impending
death
is
uniform.
why
even
bother
with
that
requirement
if
it
could
all
come
in
under...
under
this
procurement
of
the
absence-of-the-witness
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
my
question.
why
wasn't
it
enough
for
the
prosecution
to
say:
this
dying
person
said
that
this
defendant
killed
her;
therefore,
this
declaration
can
come
in
because
this
defendant
procured
the
absence
of
this
declarant
by
killing
her?
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody
even
ever
makes
those
arguments.
they
fight
it
out
on
whether
the
declarant
was
aware
of
impending
death
or
not,
but
that
would
have
been
totally
irrelevant
if
it
all
comes
in
under...
under
the
rule
that
you're
arguing
for
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it
have
to
be
interpreted
that
way?
you
don't
contend
it
could
be
interpreted
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
because
it
says
so,
i
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
us
one
case
from
the
common
law,
just
one,
in
which
the
procurement
of
a
witness's
absence
exception
to
the
confrontation
clause
was
applied
where
there
was
no
intent
to
prevent
the
witness
from
testifying?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you
do
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
want
us
to
get
caught
up
in
the
limitations
of
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
a
fault,
it's
a
fault
that
also
exists
with
the
rule
being
argued
by
your
opponent,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
i
have
to
take
that
back.
maybe
it...
it's
very...
it
would
be
very
unusual
that
someone
would
kill
a
victim
in
order
to
prevent
her
testifying
at
a
murder
trial
which
is
not
yet
in
prospect
because
you
haven't
murdered
her.
so
these
cases
may
be
very
rare.
so
maybe
that
is
an
advantage
of
her
rule
over
yours,
that
you
would
very
rarely
have
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
very
crime
for
which
he's
being
prosecuted
in
order
to
apply
the...
the
exception
to
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
rare
on
her
theory;
it
wouldn't
be
rare
on
yours.
it
happens
all
the
time
on
yours,
i
would
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
the
petitioner
dwayne
giles
was
tried
in
california
state
court
for
shooting
to
death
his
ex-girlfriend,
brenda
avie.
giles
claimed
that
he
had
acted
in
self
defense.
to
cast
doubt
on
this
account,
prosecutor's
sought
to
introduce
into
evidence
statements
that
avie
had
made
to
a
police
officer,
about
three
weeks
before
the
shooting
in
which
she
had
said
the
giles
had
accused
her
of
having
an
affair
and
then
choked
and
punched
her,
and
threatened
her
with
a
knife.
the
trial
court
allowed
these
statements
to
come
into
evidence
over
giles's
objection.
a
jury
convicted
giles
of
first-degree
murder
and
he
appealed,
claiming
among
other
things
that
the
admission
of
avie's
statements
violated
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
california
court
of
appeal
and
the
california
supreme
court
affirmed
giles'
conviction.
they
concluded
that
although
the
sixth
amendment
of
our
constitution
ordinarily
requires
that
defendants
have
the
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross-examine
the
witnesses
who
give
testimony
against
them,
giles
forfeited
his
constitutional
objection
to
the
introduction
of
un-confronted
testimony
from
avie
because
he
committed
the
murder
for
which
he
was
on
trial.
and
it
was
this
criminal
act
that
made
avie
unavailable
to
testify.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
sixth
amendment
provides
that,
“in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.”
this
provision
aims
to
prevent
criminal
defendants
from
being
convicted
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
the
founding
generation
regarded
as
unreliable.
it
does
not
admit
of
open-ended
exceptions
to
be
established
by
the
courts.
we
have
therefore
held
that
a
defendant
maybe
convicted
based
on
the
testimony
of
a
witness
whom
the
defendant
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
only
when
the
testimony
falls
within
an
exception
to
the
confrontation
right
that
was
established
when
the
sixth
amendment
was
adopted.
there
was
at
that
time
no
exception
to
the
confrontation
right
sweeping
in
every
case
in
which
in
the
view
of
the
judge,
a
defendant
committed
an
intentional
act
that
rendered
a
witness
unavailable
to
testify.
common-law
courts
did
recognize
a
doctrine
of
forfeiture
by
wrongdoing
but
it
was
much
narrower
in
scope.
they
allowed
the
introduction
of
statements
by
an
absent
witness
who
was
“detained”
or
“kept
away”
by
the
“means
or
procurement”
of
the
defendant.
cases
and
treatises
before
and
after
the
founding
indicate
that
this
rule
applied
only
when
the
defendant
engaged
in
conduct
designed
to
prevent
a
witness
from
testifying.
thus,
where
the
evidence
at
a
murder
trial
indicated
the
defendant
murdered
the
victim
but
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
testimony.
courts
routinely
excluded
the
murdered
victim's
un-confronted
testimony
unless
it
fell
within
a
separate
exception
to
the
confrontation
rule
for
statements
of
a
speaker
who
was
both
on
the
brink
of
death
and
was
aware
that
he
was
dying.
not
only
was
the
broad
forfeiture
rule
that
the
state
advocates
here
not
established
at
the
time
of
the
founding
but
it
has
not
been
established
in
this
country
since
the
founding.
we
have
identified
no
decision
before
1985
invoking
forfeiture
as
a
basis
for
admitting
the
testimony
of
an
absent
witness
unless
the
defendant
engaged
in
conduct
intended
to
prevent
the
witness
from
testifying.
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
which
we
have
previously
described
as
codifying
the
forfeiture
doctrine
also
require
this
kind
of
specific
intent.
as
to
all
but
one
of
the
state
evidentiary
codes
that
contain
forfeiture
exceptions
to
their
hearsay
rules.
there's
nothing
mysterious
about
the
limits
of
the
forfeiture
exception
to
confrontation,
unless
courts
admitted
un-confronted
testimony
when
a
defendant
took
acts
aimed
at
preventing
a
witness
from
testifying,
defendants
would
have
an
intolerable
incentive
to
bribe,
intimidate,
or
even
kill
witnesses
against
them.
but
beyond
this
carve
out
necessary
to
protect
the
integrity
of
judicial
proceedings,
the
notion
that
judges
may
strip
the
defendant
of
a
right
that
the
constitution
deems
essential
to
a
fair
trial,
on
the
basis
of
a
prior
judicial
assessment
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
as
charged
does
not
sit
well
with
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
it
is
akin,
one
might
say,
to
"dispensing
with
jury
trial
because
a
defendant
is
obviously
guilty."
while
states
may
not
abridge
the
constitutional
rights
of
criminal
defendants
in
order
to
combat
domestic
violence,
it
is
true
and
this
was
a
domestic
violence
case.
it
is
true
that
acts
of
domestic
violence
are
often
intended
to
dissuade
a
victim
from
resorting
to
outside
help.
prior
abuse
or
threats
of
abuse
meant
to
dissuade
the
victim
from
seeking
help
would
be
highly
relevant
in
assessing
whether
a
subsequent
act
of
wrongdoing
was
intended
to
prevent
a
victim
from
giving
testimony.
the
state
courts
did
not
consider
giles's
intent
because
they
found
intent
irrelevant
to
the
forfeiture
exception
to
the
confrontation
guarantee.
this
view
of
the
law
was
error,
but
the
state
courts
are
free
to
consider
evidence
of
the
defendant's
intent
on
remand.
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
vacated,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
as
has
justice
alito.
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
kennedy
have
joined.
