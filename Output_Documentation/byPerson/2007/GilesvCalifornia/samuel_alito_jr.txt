justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
whether
there
is
really
anything
involved
in
this
case?
both
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
rational
trier
of
fact
would
have
concluded
that
the
shooting
was
excusable
or
justifiable.
doesn't
that
virtually
guarantee
that
if
there
was
an
error
here,
it
was
harmless
error?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
is
that
correct?
weren't
they
concluding
that,
based
on
the
independent
evidence,
it
was
virtually
inconceivable--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
the
record
show
what
happened
after
the
police
went
and
received
the
statements
by
ms.
avie?
did
she
ask...
did
she
ask
to
have
charges
brought?
did
the
police
file
a
complaint?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
nothing
happened?
they
took
this
statement
and
that
was
it?
