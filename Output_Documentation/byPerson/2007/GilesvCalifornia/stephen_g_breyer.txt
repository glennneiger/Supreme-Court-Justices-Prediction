justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
much
are
we
supposed
to
follow
the
common
law,
in
your
opinion,
as
it
was
in
the
18th
century
or
12th
century,
or
something?
i
mean
suppose,
to
take
a
fanciful
example...
i
mean...
but
suppose
there
was
a
common-law
rule.
and
i
know
there
wasn't,
but
suppose
there
was
a
common-law
rule
that
said
in
cases
involving
witches
you
cannot
admit
any
evidence
because
either
the
witch,
the
accused
witch,
came
up
out
of
the
water
when
they
were
dunking
her,
and,
therefore,
she
is
guilty,
so
there
is
no
need;
or
she
is
under
water,
which
shows
she
is,
you
know,
guilty,
but
you
can't
cross-examine
a
person
under
water.
now
if
there
were
a
rule
like
that,
would
we
now
incorporate
it
into
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
the
answer
is
meant
to
be
no.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
let's
get
more
realistic.
there
are
all
kinds
of
rules--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
so
there
are
all
kinds
of
rules
of
disqualification
of
witnesses
in
the
17th
and
18th
century.
you
couldn't
testify.
in
this
case
there
would
have
been
no
admission
if
she
had
been
married
to
the
man
instead
of
being
his
girlfriend.
you
couldn't
have
a
spouse;
you
couldn't
have
an
interested
party;
you
couldn't
have
a
child
who
didn't
understand
the
oath;
you
couldn't
have
a
person
who
was
an
atheist;
you
couldn't
have
somebody
who
was
a
convicted
felon.
so
now
are
we
supposed
to
incorporate
all
of
these
things
into
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
confrontation
clause
that
you
couldn't
cross-examine
person
who
didn't
understand
the
meaning
of
the
oath?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
about
a
person
who...
the
same
facts
that
he
could
not...
wasn't
eligible
to
testify?
at
common
law
you
never
could
have
gotten
that
person
to
testify
in
court,
no
matter
what.
and,
therefore,
what?
that's
what
i'm
asking,
if
we
are
supposed
to
follow
all
of
the
contours
of
that
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but,
now,
does
that
make
sense?
for
example,
if
this
woman
had
been
married,
she
could
not.
she...
her
testimony...
whether
your
client
deliberately
procured
her
absence,
accidentally
procured
her
absence,
whatever
he
did,
that
testimony
could
not
have
come
in,
is
that
right,
if
she
was
married
to
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
drive
at
what
the
contours
are.
which
ones
do
we
ignore,
and
which
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
think
i
did--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
joined
crawford,
and
justice
scalia
would
like
to
kick
me
off
the
boat,
which
i'm
rapidly
leaving
in
any
event,
but
the...--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
but
my
question...
i
want
to
go
back
because
what
i'm
finding
difficult
is...
well,
let's
take
the
specific
case.
suppose
they
had
been
married.
if
they
had
been
married
in
1789,
i
guess,
or
1750,
or
1400,
or
whenever,
her
testimony
would
not
have
come
in
regardless.
i
think
i'm
right
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
as
a
spouse.
and,
therefore,
whether
he
procured
her
absence
or
not
is
beside
the
point.
now,
do
we
follow
that
rule
under
the
confrontation
clause
today?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason,
i
think,
is...
i
think,
if
i
understand
justice
scalia's
question,
take
ordinary
hearsay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
there's
a
reason
for
keeping
it
out,
though
there
are
many
exceptions.
now
take
that
subset
of
ordinary
hearsay
where
it
was
a
statement
made
purposefully
to
go
to
trial.
now
there
is
especially
good
reason
for
keeping
it
out,
so
like
a
double
reason.
and
i
think
he
finds
it
odd
that
we,
under
the
common
law,
putting
us
back
then,
would
say
there's
an
exception
where
there's
especially
good
reason
for
keeping
it
out,
see,
in
the
testimonial
case,
an
exception
where
you
go
get
the
person
murdered,
but
you
didn't
do
it
purposefully.
but...
but
there
is
no
exception
in
just
where
there's
only
the
ordinary
reason
for
keeping
it
out.
it
should
seem
to
work
the
other
way
around.
now,
to
me
that
suggests
that
maybe
we
shouldn't
follow
completely
the
common
law
as
it
evolved
in
evidentiary
principles.
maybe
we
have
to
assume
an
intent
to
allow
the
contours
of
the
confrontation
clause
to
evolve
as
the
law
of
evidence
itself
evolves.
otherwise,
we
get
caught
up
in
these
logical
contradictions.
what
do
you
think
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
see
what
my
question
was?
my
question
is
the
same
question
i
asked
your
fellow
counsel.
my
question
is,
since
i
led
you
to
the
point
where
you
were
willing
to
say
maybe
there
is
some
flexibility
here,
what?
that's
where
i'm
having
the
trouble.
what
precisely
are
the
principles
i
should
follow
to
prevent
my
going
back
to
look
at
they
dunked
witches,
but
allowing
the
heart
of
crawford
to
be
maintained.
how
do
i
do
it?
i
don't
know
if
you
can
answer
that
question,
but
that's
the
problem
that
i'm
having.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
think
these
cases
come
in...
this
problem
comes
in
with
spousal
abuse.
now,
i
don't
know
what
the
numbers
are,
but
i
bet
you
could
find
numbers.
i
suspect,
but
i
don't
know,
that
in
many
cases
where
there's
a
death
in
that
kind
of
situation,
maybe
it
is
accidental.
maybe
the...
maybe
the
man
who
is
beating
up
his
wife
didn't
really
want
her
to
die.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
that
to
me,
i
guess,
suggests
that
that's
in
favor
of
your
rule,
i
think.
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
that
would
be
true,
whether
it
was
intended
or
whether
it
isn't
intended.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whether
it's...
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
how
to
even
administer
even
a
criminal/civil
distinction.
