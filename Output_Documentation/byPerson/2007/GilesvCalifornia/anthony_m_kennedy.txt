anthony
m.

but
we
are
not...
well,
but
we
are
talking
about
the
door...
the
door
opening
here
at
trial.
did
he
give
notice
that
he
was
going
to
testify
in
california?
do
they
have
some
rule
that
if
you're
going
to
testify,
you
have
to
give
notice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
tends
to
diminish
somewhat,
but
not
entirely,
your,
i
think,
quite
proper
response
that
this
came
in
on
direct
not...
not
cross.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course...
of
course,
that's
true.
that
is
the
reason
for
the
confrontation...
confrontation
rule.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
is
responsive
to
his
defense;
and
you
say,
well,
it's
his
state
of
mind,
and
her
testimony
was
general.
i
think
it
does
go
to
his
state
of
mind.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
are
talking
here
about
the
definition
or
the
contours
of
the
equitable
rule,
the
forfeiture
rule,
for
confrontation.
and
i
think
perhaps
what
justice
ginsburg
was
suggesting,
and
certainly
what
i
was
suggesting,
is
that
when
we
are
looking
at
whether
or
not
there
is
a
forfeiture,
we
are
talking
about
equitable
considerations.
now,
it's
true
in
this
case
we
are
presented
with
an
instance
that
i've
never
seen,
which
is
that
the
murder
itself
makes
the
declarant
unavailable
for
purposes
of
the
equitable
exception.
and
it
is
true
that
that
goes
much
further
than
the
common
law
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
think
what
justice
breyer
is
saying--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
i
think
what
justice
breyer's
line
of
questioning
points
out
is
that
there
were
other
provisions
of
the
evidence
rule
followed
in
england
which
would
not
allow
the
testimony
to
come
in,
in
the
first
place.
in
this
case,
we
wouldn't
even
have
the
issue
before
us
if
the
testimony
were
not
admissible
as
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
it
is
admissible.
then
we
have
to
ask
if
it
conforms
with
the
confrontation
clause,
which
is
the
issue
we
have.
but
because
of
the
restrictions
he
points
to,
there
was
never
the
occasion
for
the
common
law
to
explore
the
boundaries
of
the
forfeiture
exception
in
the
confrontation
context.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's...
let's
assume
that
the
only
case
on
the
books
pre-1789
was
morley,
in
which
the
defendant
did
specifically
intend
to
keep
the
witness
away
from
the
trial.
but
let's
assume,
contrary
to
fact,
that
the
morley
case
gave
a...
a
very
sweeping,
expansive
definition
of
the
equitable
forfeiture
rule
and
said
the
defendant
cannot
profit
by
his
own
wrong.
could
we
take
that
general
language
pre-1789
and
say
that
it
supports
the
rule
today,
assuming
we
could
find
that
in
the
morley
case
or
other
aspects
of
the
common
law?
or
would
we
be
just
confined,
as
you
understand
crawford,
to
the
specific
holding
of
morton
that
there
has
to
be
a
specific
intent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
please...
please
make
the
supposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
well,
suppose
we
read
the
english
authorities
that
it
does
not
foreclose
the
expansion
of
the
equitable
forfeiture
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
find
that
difficult
to
understand
because
the
dying
declaration
rule
came
up
in
many
instances
when
the
confrontation
rule
was
not
involved
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
really?
i
thought
they
came
in,
in
civil
cases
all
the
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i...
i
agree...
i'll
check
the,...
check--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
forfeiture
rule
is
designed
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
confrontation
rule.
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
comes
in.
you
still
need
another
hearsay
exception
which
will
allow
it
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it
was...
if
it
was
testimony.
there
are
a
lot
of
declarations
that
are
not
testimonial,
and
the
rule
is
very
important
for
those.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
also
declarations
that
are
testimonial,
in
which
case
we
look
to
the
confrontation
concept.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
to
the
extent
that
crawford
is
confined
simply
to
testimonial
statements,
any
number
of
statements--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
will
come
in
under
the
california
evidence
rule
are
simply
not
controlled
by
the
confrontation
clause
anyway.
it's
just...
it's
a
standard
hearsay
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
record
show
or
did
the
trial
indicate
anything
that
he
told
the
police
on
the
prior
occasion?
they
went
into
different
rooms
and
they
each
gave
statements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
it's
an
astonishingly
broad
exception
you're
asking
for.
on
the
other
hand,
testimonial
statements
are
all
that's
involved,
and
so
that's
a
narrow
class,
and
maybe
that
balances
out.
i'm
not
sure.
but
may
i
just
ask
and
you
can
comment
on
it
if
you...
may
i
ask:
the
defendant
gave
notice
that
he
would
testify?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
california
law
requires
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
it
does
not
require
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
unavailability
is
caused
by
the
defendant's
negligence.
defendant
negligently
runs
over
the
victim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
over
the
declarant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it's
negligence.
