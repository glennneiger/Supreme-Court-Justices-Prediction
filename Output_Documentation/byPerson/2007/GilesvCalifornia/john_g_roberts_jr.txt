chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-6053,
giles
versus
california.
ms.
burkhardt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was
a
dying
declaration
rule
at
the
common
law;
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
didn't
require
any
inquiry
into
the
intent
of
the
person
responsible
for
the
death,
or
the
imminent
death,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
the
dying
declaration
rule
didn't
require
intent,
why
should
yours?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
the...
the
testimony
of
someone
who
heard
her
say
something,
was
that
admissible?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
under
the
common
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
like
in
the
case
of
an
unavailable
witness?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
know
in
this
case
that
part
of
his
intent
was
not
to
prevent
her
from
testifying
at
trial?
i
mean,
it's
obvious
that
he
was
upset
about
something
else,
but
maybe
in
his
mind
he
is
saying,
oh,
boy,
if
she
has
talked
to
people
about
how
i'm
going
to
kill
her,
i'd
better
do
it
so
that
she
can't
testify.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
are
we
ever
going
to
know
that
in
a
typical
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
take
a
case
like
this,
i
don't
understand
how
that
finding
could
have
been
made.
he
knew
that
she
had
reported...
that
she
had
said
to
her
friends
he
is
going
to
kill
me;
he
is
going
to
kill
me.
and
then
he
figures
he'd
better
do
it
or
it's
going
to...
his
self-defense
claim
is
going
to
look
a
lot
weaker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
sorry
it
doesn't.
it
means
that
that
may
have
been
part
of
his
motive,
to
kill
her.
because
i'm
not
just
going
to
beat
her
up
this
time;
i'm
actually
going
to
kill
her
because
otherwise
i'm
going
up
the
river.
here
he
gets
a
great
benefit
from
murdering
her
which
is
that
her
testimony
is
not
available.
we
usually
under
our
system
don't
try
to
give
benefits
to
murderers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that,
and
you've
said--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--excuse
me,
counsel.
you've
said
that
already.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
don't
understand
under
the
legal
standard
we
might
adopt,
how
that
sort
of
finding
makes
sense.
i
mean,
you
don't
ask
him
why
did
you
kill
her;
was
it
to
prevent
her
testimony
or
not?
that's
not
available
in
the
inquiry.
so
how
can
that
sort
of
factual
finding
be
made?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
burkhardt.
mr.
de
nicola.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
suppose
that
there
are
a
lot,
a
lot
of
situations
in
which
a
dead
victim
has
made
statements
pertinent
to
the
murder.
so
wouldn't
your
rule
drive
a
pretty
big
hole
through
crawford?
this
is
not
an
isolated
instance
where
the
victim
said
something
about
the
murderer.
that
would
seem
to
be
a
fairly
common
situation,
because
most
murders
involve
people
who
know
each
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you're...
it's
certainly
true
that
this
issue
would
come
up
in
domestic
abuse
cases--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
at
all
limited.
i
assume
you
have,
you
know,
gang
cases--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--any
case
in
which
have
you
familiarity
between
the
victim
and
the
defendant,
which,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
most
typical
case,
but
it's
not
simply
in
any
way
limited
to
the
domestic
abuse
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
your
rule
wouldn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the
situation
in
which
the
case
arises--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--also
would--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--certainly
not.
it
comes
up
quite
frequently,
i
would
assume--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
you
often
have
an
association
with--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
burkhardt,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-6053
giles
versus
california.
