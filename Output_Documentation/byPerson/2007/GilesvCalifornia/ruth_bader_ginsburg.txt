justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
got...
he
got
on
the
stand,
and
he
said
some
very
nasty
things
about
her.
i
mean
he
painted
her
as
aggressive,
vengeful.
isn't
there
a
legitimate
rebuttal
when
he
is
painting
her
as
the
aggressor,
and
she
has
given
a
statement
that
suggests
that
he
is
the
one
who
was
aggressive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
could
it
have
come
in
as
rebuttal
of
his
testimony,
the
same
testimony
by
the
police?
was
it
the
police
officer
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--took
her
statement?
okay.
he
gets
on
the
stand,
and
he
says
all
of
these
unpleasant
things
about
her.
and
then
the
state
says,
okay,
now
we
have
our
chance,
and
we
are
going
to
put
in
her
statement
through
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
to
rebut
what
he
has
just
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
they
would
be
wrong...
maybe
they
would
be
wrong
in
another
case,
but
we
have
this
case,
and
justice
scalia
has
suggested,
i
take
it,
that
this
testimony
could
not
come
in
even
by
way
of
rebuttal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
by
way
of
cross-examination.
do
you...
do
you
share
that
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
may
go
to
his
credibility.
he
has
just
painted
a
picture
of
this
woman
which
is
quite
different
from
what
her
statement
to
the
police
officer
would
portray.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
your
answer
was
that
in
crawford
that
was
the
situation.
it
was
a
spouse;
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
crawford.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
was
the
defendant
who
said
he
didn't
want
her
to
testify.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
some
things
that
are
not
just
testimonial.
for
example,
suppose
she
left
a
sealed
letter.
she
has
been
murdered,
and
the
letter
is
to
be
opened
only
upon
her
death,
and
the
letter
says:
if
i
was
done
in,
go
after
him.
could
that
come
into
evidence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
it?
i'm
just
giving
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
what's
the
line
between
what...
i
understand
that
she
is
accusing
him
to
a
police
officer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
that's
testimonial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
she
is
talking
to
a
friend
and
saying
that
she
is
scared
to
death
of
this
man--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
friend
could
testify?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
difference?
if
this
rule
is
going
to
separate
the
testimonial
from
the
nontestimonial,
you
have
to
be
able
to
tell
when
it's
one
and
when
it's
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
here
it's
his
own
murder
trial.
so
he
didn't
murder
her
so
that
she
couldn't
be
a
witness
at
the
trial
for
her
murder.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
might
have
murdered
her
because
she
had
good
grounds
to
get
him
indicted
on
criminal
assault
charges.
maybe
he
murdered
her
so
that
she
would
not
be
available
to
testify
at
such
a
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
mean,
what
you
just
said,
that
this
is
not
a
problem
in
states
that
have
adopted
the
federal
rules
of
evidence?
because,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
an
exception,
the
standard
exception,
for
when
the
defendant
procures
the
witness's
absence
for
the
very
purpose
of
preventing
the
witness
from
testifying
at
a
particular
trial.
that's
the
exception
that's
in
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
you
don't
have
an
exception,
a
hearsay
exception,
for
just
being
responsible
for
the
witness's
unavailability.
so
practically,
this
couldn't
come
in
under
a
hearsay
objection
in
places
that
have
the
federal
rules
of
evidence;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
a
problem
that
was
brought
out
in
the
briefs
with...
this
man
is
standing
trial
before
a
jury
that's
going
to
determine
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
if
this
testimony
is
going
to
come
in,
the
judge
has
to
make
some
kind
of
a
preliminary
finding
that
he
killed
her
in
advance
of
the
jury
making
that
determination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you're
right,
it
would
go
back
on
the
harmless
error
question,
right?
