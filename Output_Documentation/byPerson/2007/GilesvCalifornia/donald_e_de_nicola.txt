mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
want
to
start
off
by
correcting,
i
think,
the
impression
that
the
common
law
ever
stated
a
rule
that
intent
to
tamper
was
a
prerequisite
for
keeping
out
the
evidence
of
a...
of
a
victim
of
a
murderer.
and
i
don't
think
this
court,
in
the
reynolds
case,
has
ever...
or
in
the
subsequent
cases,
has
ever
stated
such
a
rule.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
i
think,
as
justice
kennedy's
question
suggested,
that
there
are
different
elements
to...
that
need
to
be
surpassed
before
the
dying
declaration
would
come
in.
what
happens
in
the
dying
declaration
situation,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
no
validation
or
vindication
of
the
defendant's
cross-examination
rights;
and
that's
what
we
are
interested
in
here
today:
how
the
common
law
would
have
treated
the
cross-examination
right
of
a
defendant
who
killed
a
witness.
the
dying
declaration
rule
certainly
cabins
the
admissibility
of
dying
declarations
for
reliability
reasons,
but
it
did
not
detract
from
the
fact
that
the
evidence
of
the
dying
declaration
came
in
peculiarly
when
the
defendant
killed
the
victim
of
the
crime,
the
witness
whose
testimony
was
coming
in.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
it
wouldn't--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--no,
because
under
the
rule
i'm
arguing
for,
and
why
the
prosecutor
wouldn't
have
succeeded
in
making
that
argument,
the
rule
i'm
arguing
for
is
simply
that
in
the
situation
where
the
defendant
kills
the
witness
the
common
law
did
not
recognize,
or
there
is
no
strong
case
authority
that
would
indicate
that
the
common
law
would
recognize,
a
confrontation
right
with
respect
to
that
defendant
against
his
witness's
statement.
nevertheless,
the
common
law
puts
some
other
nonconfrontation
restrictions
on
the
admissibility
of
the
dying
declaration.
those
were
reliability-based
restrictions.
reliability-based
restrictions
can't
determine
the
scope
of
the
confrontation
right.
under
crawford,
the
confrontation
right
is
a
separate
process
that
has
to
be
adhered
to
and
can't
be
substituted
with
another
reliability-assessment
machine
unless
there
is
a
rule
that
would
have
let
that
statement
in
that
doesn't
depend
on
a
reliability
assessment.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
let
me...
let
me
take
a
different
tack.
under
the
common-law
rule,
if
the
defendant
killed
the
witness
and
the
witness's
statement
met
the
dying
declaration
criteria,
that
statement
would
come
in
against
the
defendant.
but
if
the
defendant
killed
the
same
victim
and
you
had
another
witness
who
witnessed
the
crime
and
made
a
dying
declaration
that
qualified
under
the
rule,
that
dying
declaration
describing
the
defendant's
infliction
of
the
mortal
blow,
that
dying
declaration
would
not
have
come
in.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes,
but
i
think...
but
i
think,
with
respect
to
testimonial
statements,
it...
i
think
it
gives
you
an
insight
into
what
the
common
law
would
have
done
with
respect
to
the
alleged
confrontation
rights
of
the
murderer
against
the
victim
to
know
that
when
the
defendant
murdered
the
victim,
the
victim's
dying
declaration
came
in
without
regard
to
confrontation.
it
might
not
have
been
excluded
because
it
might
not
have
met
other
criteria,
but
it
would
have
come
in
without
confrontation.
and
it
would
have
come
in
without
confrontation
in
a
way
that
the...
the
mere
witness
who
makes
a
dying
declaration
and
witnesses
the
same
crime
would
not
have
come
in.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
i
think
it
would...
it...
i
think
it
would,
it
would
apply
in
murder
cases
with
respect
to
the
statements
of
the
victim.
so
i
think
the...
i
think
the
application
of
the
forfeiture
rule
on
a
murder
basis
as
we
are
suggesting
here,
yes,
i
think
it
would--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--right.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
like
the
california
supreme
court
recognized,
and
it
was
buttressed,
i
think,
by
this
court's
decision
in
davis,
simply
because
the
defendant
might
forfeit
his
confrontation
rights
because
he
murders
the
victim,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
forfeits
his
other
hearsay-rule
protections
or
his
other
constitutional-reliability
protections
or
his
right
to
impeach
the
hearsay
declarations
of
the
unavailable
witness
or
his
right
to
contradict
them
or
his
right--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--yes.
if
the
federal
rule
were
interpreted
to
require
the
intent
to
tamper,
in
any
jurisdiction
that
decided
as
a
matter
of
their
own
hearsay
policy
that
they
wanted
to
govern
the
admissibility
of
evidence
along
those
lines,
then,
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
i
don't
know
exactly
whether
the
federal
rule
has
uniformly
been...
been
interpreted
to
require
a
specific
intent.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
there
is...
i
don't
think...
for
example,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
federal
case
that's
been
cited
where
the
forfeiture
has
been
denied
in
a
situation
where
the
defendant
murdered
the
witness.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
i
don't...
i
don't
think
i
have
the
case--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--that...
that
applied
the
rule.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
a
case
that
articulated
the
rule
in
a
way
that
would
have
limited
its
application.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
we
can
certainly
take
account,
for
example,
of
situations
that
the
common
law
might
not
have
faced
or
might
not
have
recognized
as
representing
a
problem
of
relevant
evidence
to
a
crime.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
that,
although
the
confrontation
clause
under
crawford
would
be
accepted
under
the
governing
common-law
rule
at
the
time,
the
governing
common-law
rule
at
the
time
included
this
forfeiture
doctrine,
and
the
forfeiture
doctrine
i
think
has
been
recognized...
has
been
based
on
the
maxim
and
the
principle
that
no
one
may
profit
from
wrongdoing.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
well,
again,
i
think...
i
think
the
resort
to
the...
to
the
maxim
and
the
equitable
principles
that
we
know
that
common
law
subscribed
to
and
that
common
law
subscribed
to
those
principles
in
this
precise...
as
a
rule
to
decide
how
to
resolve
this
particular
kind
of
issue
where
the
defendant's
wrongdoing
makes
the
witness
unavailable,
that
the...
that
because
the
common
law
accepted
this
maxim,
that
we
can...
we
can
look
and
apply
those
principles
to
the
situation
even
though
there
might
not
have
been
the
precise
common-law
case
an
all
fours.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
the
record
doesn't
show,
your
honor.
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes,
yes,
in
terms
of...
because
that
was
a
description
of
the
event
that
led
to
the
admissibility
of
the
statement.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
no.
but...
but
to
the
extent
that
this
is
a
case
where
the...
the
crime
occurs
after
there
had
been
this
prior
report
to
an
official,
this
case
is
somewhat
closer
to
the
witness
tampering
scenario
that
my
opponent
says
characterized
the
admissibility
of
these
cases
at
common
law.
so
it's
not...
it
wouldn't
be
a...
a
departure
from
the
theory
that
they
are
proposing
to
recognize
that
in
this
situation
it's...
it's
essentially
similar.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
prior
to
trial,
there
was
a
discussion
about
what
sort
of
defense
he
was
going
to
be
putting
on,
and
he
clearly
indicated--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--no.
no.
it
just--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--it
doesn't
require
that.
it
just...
it
happened
that,
in
discussing
the
admissibility
of
all
this
other
evidence
he
wanted
to
bring
in
to
put
words
in
the
mouth
of
the
victim,
the
court
inquired
about
how
that
would
be
linked
up
to
the
defense
of
self-defense.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
and
that's
why
the
defendant's
lawyer
indicated
that
the
client
would
be
testifying
and
putting
on...
putting
on
a
defense
of
self-defense.
now,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the...
if
you
look
at
the
maxim,
the
logic
or
the
rational
of
the
forfeiture
rule,
it
doesn't
admit
of
any
exception
for
motive
to
tamper.
the
motive-to-tamper
rule
that
my
opponent
is
proffering
here
i
think
is
alien
to
the
rationale
of
the
maxim.
the
maxim
is
that
no
one
shall
profit
from
wrongdoing.
the
superimposition
of
an
intent
requirement
or
a
motive
requirement
wouldn't
change
the
fact
that,
with
that
intent
or
without
the
intent,
there
would
be
the
same
profit
from
the
wrongdoing.
there
would
be
the
same
damage
to
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
trial
because
the
truth-finding
function
of
the
criminal
trial
would
be
damaged
by
allowing
the
wrongdoing
to
be
used
as
the
basis
for
keeping
out
the
statement
of
the...
of
the
witness,
of
the
victim
of
the
crime,
and
allowing
the
defendant
to
substitute
in
its
stead
his
own
one-sided
or
half-true
version
of
the--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--i
think
if
that
were--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--yes.
i
think
if
that
were
a
crime,
certainly,
i
think
it
would
clearly
satisfy--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--if
it's
mere
negligence?
if
it's
mere
negligence,
certainly
that's
a...
that's
a
tougher
call,
and
it
might
be
that
in
a
situation
of
noncriminal
conduct
the
intent
to
tamper
conceivably
could
play
a
role
in
elevating
that
conduct
to
the
kind
of
wrongdoing
that
would
trigger
the
rule.
but
i
think
as
long
as
you
have
criminal
conduct
and
certainly
where
you
have
a
murder,
the
rule
would
be
triggered
and
the...
the
inquiry
would
then
be
whether
or
not
there
was
causation
and
whether
or
not
there
would
be
this
profit.
and
the
intent
to
tamper
doesn't
really
relate
to
the
purpose
of
the
rule
to
prevent
the
profiting.
so
you
have
the
same
profit,
the
same
damage
to
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
the
same
prejudice
to
the
state,
which
is
denied
the
live
testimony
of
the
victim.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
happened...
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case,
so
that
would
be,
i
think,
the
template
for
what
would
happen
in
future
cases.
one
i
think
preliminary
point
is
that
in
the
california
supreme
court,
giles
essentially
conceded
that
the
forfeiture
rule,
when
it
was
otherwise
applicable,
does
apply
in
the
case
where
you
have
the
wrongdoing
being
the
same
crime
that's
charged.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
it's
also...
it's
not...
it's
not
unlike
the
way
a
federal
court
would
have
a
foundational
hearing
to
make
a
preliminary
determination
about
the
admissibility
of
a
co-conspirator's
hearsay
statement
in
a
case
where
the
crime
charged
is
conspiracy.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
i
think
it...
i
think
it
would
be
rare.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
but...
but
it's
not...
but
it's
not
unheard
of,
and
there
is...
there
is
a
pedigree
for
it,
and--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--but
nevertheless
i
think
the...
the
idea
that
you
could
have
the
hearing
even
though
it's
the
same
issue
that
goes
before
the
jury,
i
think
is
not
an
obstacle
to
applying
the
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes,
i
think
it...
i
think,
again,
regardless
of
what
defendant's
intent
is,
the
rule
and
the
logic
of
the
rule
applies.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
but
i
think
the
same,
you
know,
as
was
said
before,
the
argument
that
what
came
in,
in
this
case,
was
this
damaging
evidence
that...
that
undermined
the
defendant's
self-defense
claim.
well,
that
evidence
would
come
in
even
under
the
theory
that
intent
to
tamper
were
required
for...
for
the
forfeiture,
as
well
as
under
our
theory.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
no.
it
wouldn't
be
limited
to
the...
this
case,
it
wouldn't
be
limited
to
the
domestic
abuse
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
okay--
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
--no.
no.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
in
gang
cases,
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
de
nicola
yes.
and
i
think
it
can
come
up
in
cases
of...
of
abuse
of
children,
as
another
example.
so
i
think
because
there's
no
equitable
argument
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
about
why
this
rule,
this
no-profit
rule,
would
depend
on
an
intent
to
tamper,
i
think
if
you
transport
that
back
into
the
common
law,
the
same
rule
and
the
same
principles
of
applying,
and
you
would...
you
would
have
i
think
the
same
results.
excuse
me.
i
think...
again,
well,
i
don't
want
to
repeat
myself,
but
i
guess
i
just
want
to
again
emphasize
that
the...
that
the
logic
of
the
rule
really
doesn't
admit
of
an
intent
requirement.
nothing
in
this
court's
cases
has
ever
dictated
an
intent
requirement.
nothing
in
the
common-law
cases
has
ever
articulated
an
intent
requirement,
and
in
the
common-law
cases
the
rule
that
we
are
advancing
is
justified
by
the
maxim
that
applied
at
the
common
law,
and
it
was
also
justified...
well,
at
least
i
think
an
insight
into
how
common
law
would
have
devalued
the
confrontation
rights
of
the
killer
against
the
witness
can
be
seen
in
the
dying
declarations
case.
because
even
though
they
might
ultimately
have
proved
inadmissible
on
another
ground,
where
the
special
criteria
for
the
dying
declaration
cases
was
not
met,
those
cases
nevertheless
are
instances
where
the
evidence
comes
in
against
the
defendant
where
he
kills
the
victim.
the
slayer's
cases
that
were
recognized
at
common
law
where
no
intent
was
required
before
somebody
would
be
barred
from
receiving
an
inequitable
distribution
from
an
insurance
policy,
or
from
a
testator,
those
cases
were
also
decided
at
common
law
under
this
maxim.
and
the
ultimate...
i
think
the
ultimate
element
to
the
analysis
that
proves
dispositive
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
benefitting
from
the
wrongdoing.
my
opponent
says
that
there's
no
benefit
from
the
wrongdoing
unless
there
is
an
intent
to
commit
the
wrongdoing
in
the
first
place,
but
that's
palpably
not
so
because
you...
because
you
have
the
benefit
if
you
have
the
benefit.
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is...
an
intent
requirement
might
be
perceived
as
necessary
to
provide
some
level
of
moral
blameworthiness
in
terms
of
exploiting
the
wrongdoing,
that
exploitation
occurs
in
any
event
when
the
defendant
seeks
to
take
advantage
of
the
wrongdoing
by
making
the
objection
and,
as
in
this
case,
exploiting
it
even
further
at
trial.
so
the
equities
of
the
situation...
there's
no,
i
think,
personal
equity
that
weighs
in
the
balance
on
the
basis
of...
in...
on
the
side
of
keeping...
keeping
the
evidence
out.
where
there
is
the
wrongdoing
and
the
causation
and
the
profit
from
the
wrongdoing,
the
statement
should
come
out...
should
be
admitted
without
regard
to
the
mental
state
