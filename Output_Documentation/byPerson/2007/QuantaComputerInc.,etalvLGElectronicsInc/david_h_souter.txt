justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
one...
there's
one
more
wrinkle
that
you
don't
expressly
advert
to
and
that
is
the
argument
that
what
is
in
issue
here
are
the...
are
the
systems
and
methods
patents,
rather
than
the...
the
equipment
component
patents.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
with
respect
to
the
equipment
component
patents
nothing
is
being
retained,
but
with
respect
to
the
systems
and
method
patents
nothing
was
being
granted.
what
is
your
answer
to
that
answer
to
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
answer
simply
is
that
that
the
argument
rests
upon
a
mistake
of
fact
which
has
not
been
challenged
in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
every
infringement
of
the
license
is
necessarily
an
unauthorized
sale.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
could
be
a
restriction
in
the
license
which
is
not
a
restriction
on
sale
and
that
could
be
violated.
and
the
exhaustion
doctrine
would
still
apply,
and
you
might
have
remedies
in
some
another
theory,
i.e.,
contract.
justice
david
h.
souter
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
no.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
it's
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
but
assuming
a
simple
notice,
the
answer
to
his
bicycle
hypo
is
yes,
they
can
chase
me
down
the
road.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
because
they're
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--they're
saying
the
reason
they
have
done
so
is
that
the
following
distinction
is
significant.
there's
a
distinction
between
a
license
that
says
you
can't
sell
this
unless
certain
conditions
are
satisfied
and,
on
the
other
hand,
a
license
that
says
you
can
sell
this,
but
if
you
sell
it
to
a
buyer
who
is
described
by
conditions
a
and
b,
you've
got
to
tell
the
buyer
that
we're
going
to
make
a
claim
against
a
and
b.
and
the
ones...
in
the
first
example,
there
is
a
limit
to
the
right
to
sell.
in
the
second
example,
there
is
no
limit
on
the
right
to
sell,
but
there's
a
warning
about
what
we're
going
to
do
if
you
do
sell
under
certain
conditions.
and
i
think
they're
saying
that
unless
you
have
a
contract
of
the
former
sort
which
limits
your
right
to
sell,
then
when
you
do
sell,
exhaustion
applies
and
whatever
you
may
do
against
the
ultimate
buyer
is...
is
a
contract
problem
or
what-not,
but
it's
not...
it's
not
a
matter
of
patent.
justice
david
h.
souter
number
one,
do
you
think
i
am
being
correct
in
characterizing,
describing
the
distinction
they
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
b,
if
i
am,
why
isn't
that
distinction
an
answer
to
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i
understand
where
you're
going.
so
then
what
you're
saying,
i
guess,
is
that
the
real
issue
does
not
involve
this
distinction
between
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--a
limited
right
and
a
right--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
go
after
people--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
it...
what
it
involves
is
the
statement
that
they
make
that
if
you
license
the
manufacture,
use,
and
sale
of
a
particular
component
and
that
particular
component
has
only
one
reasonable
use--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
you
have
necessarily
licensed
them
to
sell
with
that
ultimate
use
in
mind,
and
when
you
do...
when
you
license
them
to
sell,
the
patent-exhaustion
doctrine
attaches
to
any
patent
right
that
you
may
have,
whether
you
call
it
system--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
whether
you
call
it
component.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
are
saying
that
argument
is
no
good
because
that,
in
fact,
is
an
implied
license
argument,
and
there
were
findings
that
there
was
no
implied
license.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
understand
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
difference
between
"conditional
sale"
and
"limited
sale"...
you
are
saying
they
used
the
word
"conditional".
you
are
saying
it
was
a
"limited
sale"
that
only...
a
"limited
license".
it
only
licensed
patents
a
and
b
and
not
patents
c
and
d.
