justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
subsequent
conduct.
if
the
implied
license
occurred,
it
didn't
occur
at
the
time
of
the
sale;
and
it
couldn't
be...
it
couldn't
be
negated
at
the
time
of
the
sale.
if
it
occurred,
it
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
license,
right,
from
the
patentee
of
the
patent
at
stake.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
was
no
such
notice
there.
there
was
no
such
statement
there
that
this
does
not...
you
don't
have
the
right
to
sell
this
for
its
normal
uses?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
the
horse
is
out
of
the
barn.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
i
mean
if
both
parties...
if
both
parties
agree
to
that
notice,
i
guess
that
would
be
something
else.
did
both
parties
agree
to
that
notice?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that...
that
doesn't
matter
to
me.
what
matters
to
me
is
whether
it
was
prior
to
the
license.
if
there
was
an
implied
license
here,
it
occurred
at
the
time
that
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
give
the
licensee...
you
implicitly
give
the
licensee
the
right
to
permit
the
people
to
whom
he
sells
the
product
to
use
the
license.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
given
to
the
licensee
surely.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
it's
implicit,
unless
it's
implicit
when
you
sell
a...
a
bicycle
pedal
that
can
only
be
used
in
bicycles.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
notice.
that's
later.
that's
downstream.
that's
after
the
license.
that's
at
the
time
of
the
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
when
you
say
that
was
resolved
adversely,
you
say
there
was
a
finding
of
no
implied
license.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
a
finding
of
no
implied
license
from
lge
to
intel
or
no
implied
license
from
intel
to
the
buyers?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
crucial...
is
that
the
crucial
step?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
that
was
an
implied
license
from
lge
to
intel,
then
intel
would
have
authority
to
sell...
to
sell
these
things
for
their...
for
their
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
exhaustion,
if
intel
got...
if
intel
got...
i'm
sorry.
yes,
if
intel
got
an
implied
license
to
the
system
from
lge
when
it
sold
those
products,
it
seems
to
me
the
exhaustion
doctrine
would
take
hold
and
would...
would
apply
to
that
implied
license
just
as
it
applied
to
the...
to
the
license
of
the
chips.
