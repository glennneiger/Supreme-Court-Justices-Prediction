justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
give
you
a
specific
example?
i
think
the
chief
has
something
on
this
order
in
mind.
could
the
patentee
say
to
the
licensee,
to
the
intel,
that,
i
license
you
to
sell
only
to
buyers
who
have
a
license
from
the
patentee?
could...
could
the
licensee
be
limited
in
that
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
explain
to
me...
perhaps
i
should
ask
mr.
phillips
this
question...
but
why
isn't
it
done
that
way?
the
way...
if
the
patentee
wants
to
maintain
control
further
down
the
line,
why
doesn't
the
patentee
just
limit
the
licensee
to
selling
to
people
who
are
licensed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hungar,
is
there
a
reason
why
congress
codified
this
doctrine
in
the
copyright
act,
but
not
in
the
patent
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
pto
didn't
take
any
position
on
whether
it
should
be
codified?
