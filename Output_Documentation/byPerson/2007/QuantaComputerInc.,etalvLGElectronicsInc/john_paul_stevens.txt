justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
mahoney,
can
i
just
get
one
thing
straight
in
my
mind.
which
transaction
triggered
the
exhaustion
doctrine
in
your
judgment,
the
general
license
to
intel
or
the
sale
by
intel
to
quanta.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
license
unrestricted?
that's
one
of
the
reasons
i
asked
the
question.
wasn't
there
a
use
restriction
on
the
resale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
condition
that
it
be
sold
to
someone
who
would
not
use
it
on
non-intel
products.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
mahoney,
i
understand
that's
really
the
way
it's
been
litigated,
but
i
have
to
confess
i
was
puzzled
by
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
that
the
granting
of
the
license
constituted
a
sale
for
exhaustion
purposes,
and
they
cited
the
masonite
case
for
that
proposition,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
support
that
proposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
exhausted
by
the
manufacturer,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
exhausted
under
this
view
by
the
licensee's
sale
of
an
article
that
it
manufactured
pursuant
to
the
license.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
seems
to
think
there's
no
distinction
between
the
sale
itself
and
the
basic
underlying
license,
whereas
i
had
thought
for
years
that
there
was
recognized
a
distinction
between
those
two
transactions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
this
case
would
come
out
differently
if
instead
of
just
requiring
a
notice
that
the...
the
item
should
only
be
used
on
intel
products,
that
had
been
a
condition
of
the
license.
if
the
license
itself
said
you
may
manufacture
and
sell
to
only
people
who
agree
to
use
the
product
exclusively
with
intel
products?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
key
fact
in
this
case
is
it
was
just
a
requirement
of
giving
notice
rather
than
a
condition
in
the
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
big
key
is
what
is
an
authorized
sale?
and
i'm
asking
you
if
the...
if
the
license
agreement
to
the...
to
intel
had
said
you
may
only
sell
to
people
who
agree
to
use
the
products
on
the
patentee's
products,
that
then
would...
and
they
did
otherwise,
they
didn't
get...
then
it
would
not
have
been
an
authorized
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
you
do
not
defend
the
mallinckrodt
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you
also
do
not
challenge
the
proposition
that
the
sale
by
the
licensee
in
this
case
should
be
treated
as
a
first
sale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
other--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
the
reason
that
there's
no
implied
license
here,
one,
because
you
got
the
notice,
or
two,
because
the
component
has
uses
in
other
kinds
of
methods
than
the
patented
method?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
the
notice
on
that
to
defeat
the
implied--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
court
below
did
not
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
might
be
non-infringing
uses,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
relied
on
the
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
be
kind
of
an
unusual
answer
to
the
implied
license
argument,
because
normally
it
doesn't
depend
on
what
the
patentee
decides
to
say
somewhere
down...
down
the
line.
that's
kind
of
an
unusual
reason
for
not
finding
an
implied
license,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
sit
down,
to
what
extent
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
already
adopted
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
not
get
your
theory
of
the
case
out
of
my
reading
of
their
opinion.
