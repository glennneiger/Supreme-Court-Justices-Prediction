chief

john

roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-937,
quanta
computer
v.
lg
electronics.
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
that's
true
then
this
case
really
isn't
a
big
deal
at
all.
it
just
depends
on
exactly
how
you
word
the
contract
when
the
patentee
sells
it
to
a
purchaser.
you
can
word
it...
in
other
words,
you
can
word
it
in
such
a
way
that
the
patentee's
rights
extend
further
downstream
and
you're
saying
all
this
case
turns
on
is
whether
the
wording
here
was
correct
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
understand
your
position
to...
to
acknowledge
that
they
could
have
structured
the
sale
to
intel
in
such
a
way
as
to
achieve
the
same
result
that
you're
saying
is
so
bad
under
the
patent
laws.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
parties
are
unwilling
to
spell
out
exactly
how
this
is
going
to
work
out
in
their
contract,
and
each
side,
it
prefers
to
take
their
chances
on
how
the
federal
circuit's
going
to
rule.
it's
easier
to
sell
these
things
if
they're
not
encumbered
by
these
additional
license
requirements
and
the
manufacturer
presumably
gets
a
lot
more,
but
there's
a
lot
of
uncertainty,
uncertainty
that
could
have
been
cured
by
how
the
contract
was
drafted,
and
people
prefer
to
live
with
that
uncertainty
and
litigate
rather
than
clear
it
up
in
the
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
fine,
and
the
person
who
wrote
that
provision
knows
that
the
question
of
how
the
patent-exhaustion
doctrine
applies
is
the
subject
of
great
confusion,
so
much
confusion
that
the
supreme
court's
going
to
have
to
decide
it,
and
yet
they
put
that
in
there
rather
than
spelling
out
in
the
contract
exactly
which
they
had
in
mind,
whether
or
not
you
could
impose
these
further
restrictions
or
couldn't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
wasn't
clear
to
the
federal
circuit,
i
guess.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
mr.
hungar?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
although
you
think
it
can
be
overridden
simply
by
providing
in
the
contract
that
the
same
rights
and
remedies
would
be
available?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
mere
license
can
prevent
the
application
of
the
patent-exhaustion
doctrine?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
would
be
patent
infringement
by
the
use
of
the
product
by
the
people
that
intel
sold
to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
sound
like
your
friend
on
the
other
side,
the
respondent,
had
actually
won
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
an
important
question.
i
understood
the
argument
at
page
16
of
your
brief
to
say
that
the
patent-exhaustion
doctrine
doesn't
apply
in
that
situation
and
that
you,
therefore,
can't
have
the
rights
and
remedies
under
patent
law.
you
told
me
earlier
that
if
the
person
to
whom
intel
sells
the
product
uses
it
contrary
to
the
license
stipulation,
they
would
be
liable
for
patent
infringement.
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
suggests
to
me
that
you're
saying
only
that
they're
liable
to...
for
contract
infringement,
and
that's
a
very
big
difference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sale
from
whom
to
whom?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
you...
well,
but
what
you
say
in
your
brief
is
that
in
the
situation
we're
talking
about
the
licensee
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
patentee.
now,
if
that's
right
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
telling
me
that
the
patent
remedies
are
available
and
not
simply
contractual
remedies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
or,
more
pertinently,
it
can
only
sell
if
the
person
they
sell
to
agrees
not
to
use
the
product
in
a
certain
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
that's
the
critical
point.
you're
telling
me
that
if
the
buyer,
in
other
words,
the
kind
of
third
person
in
this
chain,
uses
the
patented
article
in
a
way
that
is
contrary
to
the
license
that
was
given
to
the
second
person
in
the
chain,
then
he
is
liable
for
contributory
infringement
under
the
patent
laws
and
not,
as
i
understood
you
to
answer
to
justice
breyer,
only
under
contract
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
sue
under
patent
law
or
just
contract
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there's
nothing
to
do
with
these
chipsets
other
than
use
them
in
the
computers.
i
mean,
you
don't
put
them
on
your
shelf.
they're
not
good
for
anything
other
than
using
in
the
computer.
so
saying
there's
a
separate
patent
for
how
you
use
them
with
the
other
systems
doesn't
seem
to
be
very
significant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
in
the
world
does
clause
3.8
of
the
license
mean?
it
says,
"notwithstanding
anything
to
the
contrary
in
this
agreement,
the
parties
agree
that
nothing
herein
shall
in
any
way
limit
or
alter
the
effect
of
patent
exhaustion
that
would
otherwise
apply
when
a
party
hereto
sells
any
of
its
licensed
products.
"
in
other
words,
the
patent
exhaustion
doctrine
may
not
apply
for
all
the
reasons
that
we've
been
talking
about,
but
it
applies
in
the
way
it
would
apply
if
we
just
sold
these
licensed
products.
that
seems
to
me
to
give
away
everything
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
the
notice
says.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
argument
didn't
prevail
last
year
in
the
ksr
case,
right?
i
mean,
we're...
we've
had
experience
with
the
patent
office
where
it
tends
to
grant
patents
a
lot
more
liberally
than
we
would
enforce
under
the
patent
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
the
way
you
achieve
that
result
is
to
condition
the
sale.
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
expand
what
you
get
under
a
condition
to
what
you
get
under
a
notice.
and
the
reason
that
troubles
me
is
because
if
you
had
imposed
a
condition
on
the
sale,
intel
wouldn't
have
paid
you
as
much
for
it.
but
you
say,
all
right,
we'll
take
the
money
because...
additional
money
because
there's
no
condition,
but
we
want
to
achieve
the
same
result
because
of
the
notice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they're
happy
with
that
because
the
notice
says
you
can't...
you
can
only
use
this
with
intel
products.
so
they're
happy
with
that
solution
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
ms.
mahoney,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
the
case
is
submitted.
