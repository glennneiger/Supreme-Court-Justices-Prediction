justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
couldn't
put
in...
you
are
authorized
to
sell
the
bicycle
pedals
that
i
have
patented
only
if
you
impose
a
restriction
that
will
tell
the
bicycle
user
that
he
must
send
me
a
check
for
$15
in
addition
to
whatever
he
pays
you.
that
sounds
unlawful
under
contract
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
you
are
going
to
have...
i
mean,
there's
a
doctrine
that
you
cannot
impose
equitable
servitude's
upon
chattel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
contract
law
doctrine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
thought
is
that
the
reason
that
these
things
are
important
and
you
can't
just
draft
your
way
around
them
is
because
there
are
antitrust
doctrines,
there
are
contract-law
doctrines,
that
also
limit
in
significant
ways
what
you
can
and
cannot
write
into
a
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there's
a
reason,
i
guess,
that
would
be
so.
imagine
that
i
want
to
buy
some
bicycle
pedals,
so
i
go
to
the
bicycle
shop.
these
are
fabulous
pedals.
the
inventor
has
licensed
somebody
to
make
them,
and
he
sold
them
to
the
shop,
make
and
sell
them.
he
sold
them
to
the
shop.
i
go
buy
the
pedals.
i
put
it
in
my
bicycle.
i
start
pedaling
down
the
road.
now,
we
don't
want
19
patent
inspectors
chasing
me
or
all
of
the
other
companies
and
there
are
many
doctrines
in
the
law
designed
to
stop
that.
one
is
the
equitable
servitudes
on
chattel.
another
is
the
exhaustion
of
a
patent.
and
now
you
talk
about
implied
license.
i
would
say,
why
does
it
make
that
much
difference?
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
after
those
pedals
are
sold
to
me
under
an
agreement
that
the
patent...
you
know,
you
have
a
right
to
sell
them
to
me...
why
can't
i
look
at
this
as
saying
that
patent
is
exhausted,
the
patent
on
the
pedals
and
the
patent
for
those
bicycles
insofar
as
that
patent
for
the
bicycles
says
i
have
a
patent
on
inserting
the
pedal
into
a
bicycle.
call
it
exhaustion,
call
it
implied
license.
who
cares?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
but
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
of
course,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
probably
no,
but,
but,
but,
but.
now
you
can
clarify
this
because
i
may
be
off
on
a
wrong
track.
i
thought
we're
talking
about
using
the
sold
item
in
those
mechanisms
which
account
for
virtually
almost
the
only
logical
use
of
the
sold
item.
thus,
if
you
took
the
bicycle
blanks...
not
the
bicycle
blanks;
they
are
eyeglass
blanks.
i'm
mixed
up
between
bicycles
and
eyeglasses,
there
we
are.
but
if
you
took
the
eyeglass
blanks
and
you
use
them
for
the
purpose
of
growing
plants
instead
of
inserting
them
into
eyeglasses,
i
guess
we'd
have
had
a
different
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
take
it
here
they
are
using
those
chips
in
those
mechanisms
that
the
chips
are
almost
exclusively
designed
for
and
there
isn't
much
else
to
use
them
for.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
now
if
it
should
be
protected...
and
here
i'm
not
sure
i'm
understanding
it,
so
correct
me.
let's
suppose
we
have
this
contract.
so
everything
is
identical
except
we've
got
my
bicycle
example
in
here
because
i'm
more
comfortable
with
that.
i
know
how
to
ride
a
bicycle
and
i
don't
know
how
to
work
the
chips.
so
what
i
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you
see
the
analogy
i'm
making.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
i
do
i
go
to
the
shop
and
i
buy
this,
this
mechanism
with
the
pedals
on
it,
and
then
i
insert
it
in
my
bicycle.
now,
actually
i
need
help
in
doing
that,
but
i
do
it.
okay.
now
i
start
pedaling
off,
and
now
what
is
it
for
all
these
things
here
that
would
stop
that
original
inventor
from
catching
me
and
hauling
me
into
court,
and
say,
what
you've
done,
breyer,
is
you've
put
my...
my
mechanism
here
in
this
bicycle
and
i
happen
to
have
a
patent
on
the
system.
and
now
you
start
talking
to
me
about,
well,
the
patent
was
exhausted
on
the
bicycle--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--pedals,
but
not
on
the
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
agree
that
shouldn't
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
i
follow
you
and
i
write
an
opinion
just
for
you,
what
stops
it
from
happening?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
isn't
it
in
your
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
doesn't
it
mean
that?
why
isn't
it
in
your
case
equally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
that
they
just
got
it
all
wrong?
you
mean
it
should
be
that
they
got
it
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
so
if
i
go
in
the
bicycle
shop,
i
go
in
the
bicycle
shop
and
i
buy
the
pedals
and
then
they
give
me,
you
know,
one
of
these
pieces
of
paper
that
has
all
of
the
42,000
words
on
it
and
there
in
these
42,000
words
it
says,
and
now
you
are
put
on
notice
that
once
you
put
it
in
your
bicycle
and
you
pedal
away,
they're
going
to
get
you
and
you're
going
to
be
hauled
into
patent
court,
then...
then
that's
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
explain...
now
this
you
might
know
because
it's
just
following
up
on
what
justice
souter
said
better
than
i
did.
i
think
from
these
briefs
i've
gotten
the
impression
that
at
least
some
people
think
that
where
you
invent
a
component,
say,
like
the
bicycle
pedals,
and
it
really
has
only
one
use,
which
is
to
go
into
a
bicycle,
it's
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
get
a
patent
not
just
on
that
component
but
to
also
get
a
patent
on
the
system,
which
is
called
handlebars,
body,
and
pedals.
and
since
that's
just
a
drafting
question,
all
that
we
would
do
by
finding
in
your
favor
is
to
destroy
the
exhaustion
doctrine,
because
all
that
would
happen,
if
it
hasn't
happened
already,
is
these
brilliant
patent
lawyers,
and
they
don't
even...
they
can
be
great
patent
lawyers,
not
just
fine
lawyers,
and
just
draft
it
the
way
i
said
and
that's
the
end
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
and
that's
why
it
is
preferable
to
say
it
is
exhausted.
what
is
exhausted?
one,
the
patent
on
this
component
and,
two,
the
patent
on
any
system
involving
this
component
where
that
system
is
the
only
reasonable
use
of
the
component,
rather
than
using
the
terminology
"implied
license".
now,
i
think
that's
an
argument
that's
being
made
in
some
of
these
briefs,
and
if
so
i'd
like
to
you
reply.
