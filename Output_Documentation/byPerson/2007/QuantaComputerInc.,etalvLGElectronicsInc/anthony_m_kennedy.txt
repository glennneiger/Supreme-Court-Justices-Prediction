justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see
your
white
light
is
on.
i
have
just
one
question.
are
there
cases
where
some
downstream
restrictions
on
use
might
be
necessary
to
prevent
the
patent
from
becoming
worthless,
i.e.,
in
the
biological
area
for
replication
of
seeds
in
agriculture
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
univis
was
one
of
your
principal
cases.
