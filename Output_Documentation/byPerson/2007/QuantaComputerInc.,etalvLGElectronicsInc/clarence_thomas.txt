thomas
the
first
case
is
quanta
computers
--
computer
versus
lg
electronics,
number
06-937.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
respondent
owns
a
portfolio
of
computer
related
patents
and
licensed
rather
broadly
those
patents
to
intel
corporation
to
make
use
and
sell
products
practicing
those
patents.
a
separate
agreement
required
intel
to
give
notice
to
its
customers
that
the
customers
had
not
been
granted
a
license
to
practice
the
patents
using
non-intel
parts.
petitioners
purchased
microprocessors
and
chipsets
from
intel
that
were
designed
to
practice
the
patents
when
connected
to
memory
and
buses,
and
buses
here
of
course,
computer
buses
are
just
connections
that
carry
data
from
one
computer
component
to
another
or
from
one
computer
to
another.
petitioners
constructed
computers
that
practiced
the
patents
using
the
intel
products
combined
with
memory
and
buses
and
respondents
sued,
alleging
patent
infringement.
petitioners
countered,
invoking
the
longstanding
doctrine
of
--
of
patent
exhaustion
whereby
the
first
authorized
sale
of
a
patented
item
exhausts
the
patent
holder's
rights
to
that
item.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
disagreed.
it
held
that
exhaustion
is
limited
to
patent
claims
for
physical
objects
and
does
not
apply
to
patent
claims
for
methods
or
process
like
those
included
in
respondent's
patents.
in
the
alternative,
it
held
that
the
sale
of
the
intel
products
to
petitioners
was
not
authorized
by
the
license.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
first,
nothing
in
this
court's
approach
to
patent
exhaustion
supports
respondent's
argument
that
method
patents
cannot
be
exhausted.
we
have
previously
applied
the
doctrine
to
method
patents
and
failure
to
do
so
here
would
undermine
the
purposes
of
exhaustion.
second,
we
consider
the
extent
to
which
a
product
must
embody
a
patent
in
order
to
trigger
exhaustion.
applying
the
analysis
used
in
united
states
versus
univis
lens
company,
we
hold
that
exhaustion
was
triggered
by
the
sale
of
the
intel
parts
because
their
only
reasonable
and
intended
use
was
to
practice
the
patent
and
because
they
embodied
essential
features
of
the
patented
invention.
the
intel
products
embody
the
essential
features
of
respondent's
patents
because
they
were
designed
to
carry
out
all
of
the
patent's
inventive
--
inventive
processes
and
need
only
be
combined
with
standard
components.
finally,
we
note
that
intel's
sale
of
the
products
to
petitioner
was
authorized.
nothing
in
the
license
agreement
restricts
intel's
right
to
sell
its
products
to
purchasers
who
intend
to
combine
them
with
non-intel
parts
nor
can
a
notice
provision
in
the
separate
agreement
create
limitations
not
contained
in
the
license
itself.
intel's
authorized
sale
to
petitioner
thus
exhausted
the
patents
and
as
a
result,
respondent
can
no
longer
assert
its
patent
rights
against
petitioners.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
