ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
this
court's
exhaustion
cases,
exhaustion
has
always
been
triggered
when
two
criteria
have
been
satisfied
and
the
district
court
properly
dismissed
these
claims
because
it
found
that
they
were
satisfied
here
on
the
undisputed
facts.
the
first
is
that
there
must
be
an
authorized
sale
under
the
patent
that
was
allegedly
infringed.
that's
never
been
in
dispute
in
this
case.
the
federal
circuit
recognized
that
intel
was
authorized
to
sell
these
components
under
the
system
and
method
patents
at
issue
in
the
case
that
have
been
allegedly
infringed.
and
the
second
criteria
is
that
the
article
sold
must
be
one
that
falls
within
the
protection
of
the
patent
that
was
allegedly
infringed,
here
the
system
and
method
patents.
but
as
univis
holds,
that
test
doesn't
apply
simply
to
articles
that
would
directly
infringe
the
patent,
because
the
law
with
contributory
infringement
standards
provides
that
protection
to
the
patent
owner
also
to
articles
that
would
contributorily
infringe.
in
other
words--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
think
they
work
in
combination
here,
your
honor,
because
once
the
sale
was...
once
the
license
was
entered
into
with
intel
and
once
unrestricted
rights
were
given
to
make,
use
and
sell
components
that
would
infringe,
otherwise
infringe
these
patents,
there
was
really
nothing
else
that
could
happen--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
there
was...
what
there
was,
the
sale
was
authorized.
the
sale
was
authorized.
what--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
think
that's
what
the
lower
courts
found
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
argument
has
ever
been,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
just
like
bobbs-merrill.
there
is
a...
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
difference
between
actually
conditioning
the
seller's
authority
to
sell
to
someone
who's
going
to
use
it
for
some
prohibited
purpose,
and
that
would
be
a
case
like
general
talking
pictures,
where
it
says,
you
do
not
have
authority
to
sell
to
someone
who's
going
to
use
it
for
the
home
market.
but
bobbs-merrill
says
if
what
you
do
instead...
it
was
a
copyright
case
that
was
applied
in
motion
picture
patents.
if
what
you
do
instead
is
you
give
them
authority
to
sell,
you
don't
say
you'll
be
in
breach
if
you
sell
it
to
somebody
who's
going
to
sell
books
at
below
the
retail
price
i've
specified,
if
instead
what
you
do
is
say,
you
have
to
agree
you'll
give
them
notice
that
the...
that
the
owner
of
the
invention,
or
in
that
case
the
copyright,
is
not
agreeing
to
your
use
of
these
books
or
sale
of
these
books
at
below
a
certain
price,
that
doesn't
count.
there's
still
an
authorized
sale,
that
when...
that
you
can't...
that
the
patent
owner
can't
try
to
retain
part
of
the
monopoly
right
to
sell.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
the
wording
hasn't
been
in
dispute,
but
a
lot
of
important
things
turn
on
it,
because
of
course
if
intel
didn't
have
the
authority
to
make
these
sales,
it
would
be
liable
for
contributory
infringement.
and
undoubtedly
when
intel
decided
how
much
to
pay
for
this
license
it
cared
deeply
about
whether
it
was
going
to
be
exposed
to
that
liability.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
once
they
have
an
authorized
sale,
then
the
results
are
different,
because
if
there
has
been
an
authorized
sale--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--they
could
do
that,
and
let
me
explain
the
consequences
of
doing
that.
if
intel
then
under
those
circumstances
sold
to
a
buyer
who
did
not
have
a
license,
intel
would
be
liable
for
contributory
infringement
because
it
wouldn't
be
an
authorized
sale,
and
the
buyer
would
be
liable
for
infringement
because
it
didn't
acquire
the
goods
through
an
authorized
sale.
if
the
buyer
instead
has
the
license,
has
obtained
the
license
from
the
patentowner,
then
there
has
been
an
authorized
sale
and
any
remedies
that
the
owner
of
the
patent
would
have
against
the
buyer
would
be
those
found
in
contract,
because
the
triggering
line
under
this
court's
cases
is
has
there
been
an
authorized
sale?
and
this
makes
perfect
sense
because--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--presumably
because
in
this
circumstance...
it's
not
in
the
record...
but
presumably
intel
wouldn't
agree
to
these
terms
unless
it
in
fact
was
given
authority
to
sell,
no
matter
how
it
was
going
to
be
used,
because
otherwise
it
would
still
be
on
the
hook
for
liability.
and...
and
presumably
they
could
have
done
something
that
would
have
required
an
agreement
with...
you
know,
between...
only
sell
to
someone
with
an
agreement.
but
for
whatever
reason
the
parties
didn't
negotiate
that
term.
perhaps
intel
wasn't
willing
to
do
it
that
way.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
i
think
that
this
court's
ruling
would
certainly
make
things
clear,
but
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
contract
recognizes
that
the...
specifically
says
that,
notwithstanding
anything
to
the
contrary,
the
ordinary
operation
of
patent
exhaustion
is
supposed
to
apply
here.
in
other
words,
i
think
intel
knew--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but,
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
univis
lens,
as
the
district
court
recognized,
the
answer
in
this
case
is
actually
quite
clear
what
the
patent-exhaustion
doctrine
would
require.
and
the
reason
it's
clear--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
wasn't
clear
to
the
federal
circuit,
but
it
was
clear
to
the
district
court,
showing
that
the
idea
that
somehow
it
was
absolutely
known
to
everybody
what
the
outcome
of
this
issue
would
be
is
not
correct.
the
district
court,
i
think
correctly,
understood
that
univis
lens
was
the
controlling
case.
of
course,
the
federal
circuit
didn't
even
cite
it.
but
the
district
court
found
that
the
univis
lens
standard
was
satisfied
because
these
components
were
necessarily
manufactured
in
a
manner
that
satisfied,
that
included
the
functionality
of
the
system
and
method
patents
at
issue
here.
at
30a,
the
district
court
looks
to
lge's
own
claim
charts
and
says
that
their
own
allegations
show
that
they
were
manufactured
in
a
way
that
met
many
of
the
limitations
of
the
claims.
in
addition,
at
67
of
the
petition
appendix,
she
says
that
by
attaching
the
components,
the
intel
chips,
to
the...
the
other
generic
wires
and
memory,
it
necessarily
caused
these
products
to
infringe.
and,
at
46,
she
says,
"failure
to
follow
intel's
design
specifications
would
render
the
computers
inoperable.
"
so,
this
is
a
case
where
there's
just
no
question
that
if
lge's
allegations
are
correct
these
products
would
have
contributorily
infringed.
so
intel
knew
that
in
order
to
avoid
potential
liability
to...
to
lge,
that
it
had
to
get
full
authority
to
sell,
and
it
did.
and
there's
never
been
any
dispute
about
that.
instead,
there's
simply
the
federal
circuit's
view
that
even
if
you
have
an
authorized
sale,
that
the
patentowner
is
nevertheless
allowed
to
say,
okay,
i
authorize
the
seller
to
sell
it
to
anybody,
but
i
want
to
retain
the
right
to
control
the
use
of
the...
of
the
buyer.
and
that's
exactly
what
this
court's
cases
have
always
said,
with
the
exception
of
a.b.
dick,
cannot
be
done
because
the
whole
point
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
is
to
demarcate
the
line
between
where
the
monopoly
power
to
control
rights
to
use
and
sell
end
and
where
any
rights
under
contract
must
begin.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
the
way
the
case
has
been
litigated
from
the
outset
as
well
as
the
terms
of
the
contract.
at
page
5
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
federal
circuit
acknowledges
that
intel
had
full
authority
to
sell
these
components
under
all
of
the
patents,
including
the
system
and
method
patents.
if
it
didn't
have
authority
to
manufacture
and
sell
under
the
system
and
method
patents,
it
would
be
potentially
liable
for
contributory
infringement.
and
in
fact
lge
has
acknowledged
in
its
brief
in
footnote
7
that
intel
isn't
potentially
liable
for
contributory
infringement
under
the
terms
of
this
agreement.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
absolutely
has
not.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
the
component
patents
are
not
at
issue
here
at
all.
and
the
idea
that
you
couldn't
have
one
patent
on
a
component
and
another
patent
on
a
system
where
the
component
would
contributorily
infringe
is
nonsensical.
these
components
had
thousands
of
patents
on
them.
and
certainly
the
argument
isn't
that
by
authorizing
the
sale
of
the
component
all
of
the
owner's
rights
are
released
in
that.
if,
instead,
there
had
been
a
sale
of
a
component
where
a
patent
owner
says,
i'll
authorize
you
to
sell
my...
my...
that
component
under
my
component
patent,
but
if
you
sell
it
under
my
system
patent...
i'm
not
giving
you
authority
to
sell
it
under
my
system
patent,
so
if
you
sell
it,
i'm
going
to
sue
you
for
infringement,
that
didn't
happen
here,
and
it's
never
been
litigated
in
that
way.
instead,
that
first
criteria
of
the
authorized
sale
has
plainly
been
satisfied,
and
the
only
question
in
this
case
has
been
whether
or
not
this
satisfied
the
contributory
infringement
standard
that
univis
lens
uses
to
define
what
articles--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
all
that
that
really
is
saying
is
that
at
a
point
when
you
enter
into...
a
patentowner
enters
into
an
unrestricted
license
to
make,
use,
and
sell
with
a
manufacturer,
then
at
that
point
any
articles
that
are
manufactured
under
that
license,
effectively
the
patent's
been
exhausted.
but
i
think
it's
easier
to--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no.
for
contributorily
infringing--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but...
right,
manufactured
pursuant--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
i
think
that
it
just
means
that
once
you
have
that
transaction
any
sales
that
occur
for
those
articles
under
that
license
are
going
to
be
exhausted
by
definition.
but,
you
know,
we
have
certainly
focused
on
the
sale
of
the
articles
to
quanta
from
intel,
and
i
think,
you
know,
it
makes
sense
to
look
at
it
that
way.
and,
as
indicated,
there
really
is...
there
have
been
arguments
that
somehow
this
deprives
the
patentowner
of
the
right
to
collect
its
full
royalty,
but
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
because
if
you...
if
you
look
at
the
rights
that
are
afforded
under
contributory
infringement,
what
congress
has
done
in
section
271(c)
and
what
this
court
had
done
before
was
to
say
that
if
you
are
the
owner
of
a
system
patent
or
a
method
patent,
you
can
go
ahead
and
collect
your
royalty
when
someone
sells
a
product
that
will
contributorily
infringe.
in
other
words,
your...
your
product
is
sufficiently...
your
patent
is
sufficiently
embodied
in
those
contributorily
infringing
products
that
it's
appropriate
for
you
to
collect
your
royalty
there.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
lge
did
get
its
royalty
from
intel,
did
give
them
authority
to
sell
products
which
would
otherwise
contributorily
infringe,
and
now
what
it's
seeking
to
do
is
to
say,
despite
the
authorized
sale,
despite
the
fact
it
would
contributorily
infringe,
we
want
to
collect
another
royalty
from
the
buyer
of
the
product
that
can't
use
it
for
any
other
purpose.
why?
well,
because
we
have...
we
had
them
sent
a
notice
that
said
we
wanted
to
do
that.
under
this
court's
cases,
that
is
completely
impermissible.
in
two
cases
in
particular,
motion
picture
patents,
they
tried
to
do
the
exact
same
thing.
and
in
the
millinger
case
the
patentowner
said
that
it
had
never
gotten
paid
for
the
extension
rights
under
its
patent.
and
this
court
said:
nope;
once
you've
sold
the
article,
that's
the
royalty
you
get.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
what
we're...
exhaustion
is
triggered
when...
with
respect
to
the
rights
to
control
and
use.
rights
to
make
are
treated
differently.
univis,
of
course,
though,
holds
that
when
you're
talking
about
the
sale
of
a
contributorily
infringing
product,
you're
really
talking
about
the
right
to...
to
make
it,
to
use
it,
to
complete
the...
complete
the
article.
but
i
think--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
is,
absolutely.
it
holds...
in
other
words,
what
univis
holds
is
that
when
you
have
an
article
that
is
uncompleted...
it's
not
finished...
as
in
this
case,
by
the...
the
sale
will...
will
mean,
by
definition,
that
you
can
use
it
to
complete
the
article.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i'd
like
to
start
by
emphasizing
what
counsel
did
not
say.
he
never
said
that
intel
lacked
the
authority
under
the
system
and
method
patents
to
sell
these
components.
he
never
said
that.
in
fact,
he
said
that
intel
was
released.
why
were
they
released?
this
would
have
been
contributory
infringement,
otherwise.
the
reason
they
were
released
was
because
they
had
the
authority
under
this
license
to
sell
these
components
under
the
system
patent.
and
that's
what
the
federal
circuit
acknowledged,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
recognized,
and
it's
never
been
in
dispute.
their
position
is
simply
that,
despite
that,
despite
express
authority
to
sell
these
under
that
patent...
not
just
under
some
other
patent,
under
the
patents
at
issue
here...
that
they
can
enforce
conditions
on
post-sale
use.
and
that's
what
this
court
has
never
allowed.
univis
is
on
all
fours.
they
say,
well,
that
just
involved
a
single
patent.
well,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it
just
involves
a
single
patent,
too.
the
whole
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
quanta's
taking
of
the
components
and
combining
them
with
some
generic
things
like
wires
and
memory
necessarily
infringed
under
lge's
allegations.
and
the
district
court
found
that
they
would,
and
that's
not
in
dispute.
and
what
that
means
is
that,
just
as
in
univis
where
you
had...
the
court
finds
there
were
really
two
products
there.
it
finds
there
were
two
different
commodities,
the
lens
blank
and
the
finished
lens.
it
says
under
miller,
the
miller/tydings
act,
these
are
two
different
commodities,
and
the
patent
was
only
on
the
finished
lens.
but,
in
order
to
make
that
finished
lens,
you
had
to...
you
had
to
make
a
lens
blank
that
would
embody
many
of
the
limitations
of
the
claim.
that's
exactly
what
the
district
court
found
happened
here.
for
this,
when
intel
manufactured
these
chips,
the
microprocessors
and
the
chipsets,
it
manufactured
them
in
a
way
that
embodied
many
of
the
limitations
of
the
system
and
method
patents
that
are
at
issue
here.
so,
as
in
the
language
of
univis,
there
they
said,
well,
we
are
dealing
with
a
product
that
is
being
manufactured
in
multiple
stages.
and
during
that
first
stage,
while
it's
true
it
wasn't...
it
didn't
directly
infringe
because
the
lens
blank
wasn't
the
patented
product,
they,
nevertheless,
practiced
the
patent
in
part.
why?
because
they...
they...
some
of
the...
while
manufacturing
it,
they
have
met
some
of
the
limitations
of
the
claim.
and
they
said
when
that
lens
blank
was
sold,
that
it
exhausted
the
rights
of
the
patent
owner
to
enforce
any
conditions,
any
type
of
conditions
on
use
or
resale
after
that
sale.
and
it
didn't
have
to
rely
on
implied
license
because
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
once
there
is
an
authorized
sale
of
a
product
that
is
protected
by
the
patent
that
covered
that
final
finished
product,
exhaustion
is
triggered.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
and
they
said,
oh,
but
you
could
disclaim
that
with
an
agreement.
well,
in
univis
there
was
an
agreement.
the
purchaser
of
that
lens
blank
specifically
agreed
by
contract
that
it
would
only
use
it
in
certain
ways
and
only
charge
certain
prices.
so
they
expressly
disclaimed,
you
know,
the
idea
that
they
were...
that
they
couldn't
use
it
in
those
ways.
and,
nevertheless,
this
court
found
exhaustion.
when
the
district
court
found
no
"implied
license",
all
the
court
was
saying
was,
well,
under
the
federal
circuit
precedent
"implied
license"
is
an
"equitable
doctrine".
i
see
my
time
is
finished.
thank
you.
