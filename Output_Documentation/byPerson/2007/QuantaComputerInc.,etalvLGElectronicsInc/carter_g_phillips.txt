mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
souter,
i
want
to
go
to
your
question,
because,
frankly,
i
think
it
is
the
key
to
the
entirety
of
this
case.
and
that
is,
what
is
the
"it"
that
we
are
talking
about?
and
what's
absolutely
critical
here
is,
yes,
there
was...
you
know,
this
is
the
first
sale
doctrine.
it's
easy
to
call
it
patent-exhaustion,
but
the
truth
is
it's
the
first
sale
doctrine.
and
the
question
is,
what
was
sold
here?
and
the
only
sale
that
was
involved
here
was
the
chipsets.
and
there
is
a
completely
separate
patent
that
deals
with
the
rest
of
the
system
and
that
deals
with
the
method.
and
nothing...
and
this
is
the
key
point
of
this.
the
exhaustion
doctrine
only
goes
as
far
as
the
sale.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
would
be...
and
that's
why
you
would
ordinarily...
you
don't
deal
with
this
as
an
exhaustion
issue.
that's
why
you
would
deal
with
this
as
an
implied
licensing
issue.
the
assumption
would
be,
in
the
absence
of
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary,
that
if
i'm
selling
you
something
that
only
has
a
single
use
and
that's
in
a
separate
patent,
that
you
in
fact
are
being
licensed
to
go
and
use
it
that
way.
but
what's
absolutely
critical
in
this
case
is
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
there
was
any
implied
license.
and
it's
important
to
realize
this.
even
as
we
approach
this
case,
we
didn't
sue
for
any
of
the
activities
that
predated
when
the
other
side
received
its
notice.
we
sued
only
for
the
activities
post
notice.
why?
because
at
that
stage
it
was
absolutely
clear
that
there
was
no
implied
license
any
longer
and
there's
no
basis
for
expanding
the
exhaustion
doctrine
to
try
to
fill
that
void.
the
exhaustion
doctrine
ought
to
be
retained
as
a
very
narrow
first
sale
doctrine,
because
it
doesn't
have
any
congressional
support
or
approval
at
this
point.
it
is
a
logical
way
of
proceeding.
it
protects
people
against
being
surprised
when
they
purchase
a
particular
product.
but
to
go
beyond
that
and
to
say
that
simply
because
that
sale,
that
particular
product
is,
quote,
an
"essential
feature"
of
a
separate
patent
and
therefore
you
have
now
exhausted
the
rights
to
that
second
patent
seems
to
me
a
stretch
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
have
any
problem
with
your
hypothetical
because
it's
not
this
case.
your
hypothetical
deals
with
the
situation
of
what
would
have
happened
if
you
had
bought
the
chip.
would
we
be
in
a
position
to
say,
even
though
you
bought
the
chip,
we
nevertheless
want
to
retain
some
right
to
come
out...
to
come
after
you
claiming
we
still
have
a
patent
in
that
chip?
and
the
answer
is
no.
we
exhausted...
that
was
exhausted
by
the
sale
of
the
chip.
the
question
is
if
you
buy
a
pedal,
can
you
then
take
that
pedal
that
was
designed
for
a
bicycle,
put
it
into
a
stair
master--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--patent
in
the
stair
master--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
true.
but
the...
but
the
point
here
is
that
that's
not
the
relevant
distinction.
it's
not
whether
or
not
this
is
in
some
sense
an
essential
use.
what
this
court
said
in
univis
is
that
this
would
be
a
very...
that
would
have
been
a
very
different
case
if
there
had
been
a
separate
patent
on
the
grinding
and
finishing
of
those
lenses.
and
that
is
precisely
our
case.
there
is
a
separate
patent
when
you
take
those
components
and
you
then
put
them
into
our
separate
system.
and
from
my
perspective,
your
honor,
the
better
way
to
analyze
this
is
not
as
a
question
of
exhaustion.
let's
keep
the
exhaustion
doctrine
where
it
fits.
it's
a
first
sale
component.
you
buy
it,
you
exhaust.
let's
use
the
implied
licensing
as
the
mechanism
for
dealing
with
related
patents.
but
the
beauty
of
that
in
this
case,
obviously,
is
that...
is
that
the
implied
license
in
this
case
the
courts
below
have
flatly
said
doesn't
exist.
and
it
goes
to
the
point
that
you
made,
justice
breyer,
as
well
when
you
said,
you
know,
i
buy
this
and
i
sort
of
assume
that
i'm
going
to
be
able
to
use
it
in
a
particular
way.
these...
this
is
a
$10
billion
company
that
at
the
time
they
bought
these
components,
these
chips,
received
explicit
and
specific
notice
that
the
one
thing
they
could
not
do
was
use
these
chips
to
build
new
systems
and
then
sell
those
systems,
obviously,
beyond...
you
know,
under
a
completely
separate
patent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
it's
not
as
though
they
didn't
know
what
they
were
getting
when
they
bought
it.
they
bought
cheap
chips
and
turned
them
into
$2,000
laptops
because
they
didn't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
because
that...
that
depends
on
the
scope
of
the
patent
exhaustion
doctrine.
if
the
patent
exhaustion
doctrine
is
limited
to
the
sale
of
the
specific
product...
let's
for
instance
assume
for
a
moment
that
what
in
fact
happened
was
that
intel
sold
the
system,
rather
than
the
chips.
then
that
would...
that
would
exhaust
the
patent
doctrine.
now,
you
know,
the
question
is...
and
here
there
is
a
disconnect
in
some
respects
between
the
mallinckrodt
decision
in
the
federal
circuit
and
some
of
this
court's
previous
decisions
on
to
the
extent
to
which
you
can
condition
a
sale,
and
i
think
in
some
ways
that
language
may
have
been
given
up
what
rights
we
might
have
been
able
to
assert
under
mallinckrodt
on
a
somewhat
broader
basis.
but
i
don't
think
it
can
be
read
any
further
than
that,
and
it
certainly...
and
the
key
to
this
is
it
certainly
doesn't
in
any
way
waive
our
rights,
you
know,
as
an
implied
license
matter,
because
that's...
specifically
what
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
is
there
is
no
implied
license
in
this
particular
context,
and
so
therefore
for
them
to
prevail
they
have
to
expand
the
patent
exhaustion
doctrine
or
the
first
sale
doctrine
beyond
the
first
sale;
and
that
i
submit
to
you
is
something
that's
simply
not
appropriate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
do
not
defend
the
mallinckrodt
decision,
justice
stevens,
and
clearly
i
don't
believe
i
have
to.
all
i
need
to
do
is
have
this
court
recognize
that
the
central
limiting
feature
of
univis
was
the
fact
that
it
was
all
one
patent
and
that
all
you
were
doing
was
fulfilling
the
rights
that
had
been
provided
for
you
in
that
single
patent,
and
that
that
that's
fundamentally...
and
that
the
court
recognized
that
if
there
were
a
separate
patent
involved
and
you
were
trying
to
enforce
those
rights,
that
would
be
a
completely
different
matter.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
the
chip.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely.
there's
no
question
about
that.
we
have
never
challenged
that,
and
i
think
the
point
i
made
earlier
is
also
valid.
we
didn't
challenge
their
use,
their
otherwise
infringement
of
our
system
until
we
gave
them
notice;
and
at
that
point
we
said
there
is
no
implied
license,
because
i
do
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
a
fair
point,
and
it's
the
same
point
justice
breyer
made,
which
is,
look,
if
you
buy
something
and
you
think
this
is
your
normal
assumption
that
you're
going
to
use
it
in
a
particular
way,
that
ought
to
be
protected.
i
think
that's
ordinary
kind
of
contract
expectation
rules.
but
the
point
here
is
that
the
language
of
this
notice
could
not
have
been
plainer
to
anyone--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--me
too.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
pedal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
in
that...
in
that
particular
context,
in
the
absence
of
relatively
clear
notice,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
reasonable
to
potentially
find
that
there
was
an
implied
license
to
use
it
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the
courts
below
specifically
analyzed
whether
there
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
no.
they
got
it
right
because
there
was
very
specific
and
explicit
notice
provided
to
the
purchaser
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
that,
while
this
clearly
gives
you
the
right
to
use
this
particular
product,
what
it
doesn't
give
you
the
right--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
justice
breyer,
we
can
quarrel
about
sort
of
the
nature
of
the
notice
and
what
notice
is
adequate
to
do
that,
but
the
basic
point
here,
which
i
think
is
indisputable,
is
that,
one,
the
notice
here
is
quite
clear.
it's
one
page.
it's
very
specific.
these
are
very
sophisticated
parties
and
they
understood
that
they
were
not
obtaining
an
implied
license
by
purchasing
the
chips
rather
than
going
out
and
purchasing
the
systems.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
to
be
sure.
if
i
have
separate
patent
on
the
bicycle,
i'm
entitled
to
stop
people
from
using
that
particular
bicycle.
now,
generally
speaking,
to
be
sure,
you
don't
go
after
the
consumers
because
most
people
who
are
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
don't
develop
a
really
good
following
by
suing
their
ultimate
consumers.
so
what
you
do
is
you
find
the
people
who
are
in
the
middle,
the
middle
spot,
who
are
actually
doing
the
manufacturing
and
who
are
in
fact
violating
the
patent,
and
that's
who
you
go
after.
and
in
this
context--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--precisely...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
better
answer
is
one,
because
they
had
clear
notice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
think
there
is
an
argument
as
to
whether
there
might
be
non-infringing
uses.
we
disagree
about
that.
but
i
think
the
better
argument
is
one.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
the
court
below
did
not
rely
on
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
right.
well,
i
mean,
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
much...
it
was
a
much
easier
case,
frankly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean
i
think
the
district
court
just
said,
look,
that...
you
know,
ordinarily
you
would
say,
if
you're
buying
something
with
the
understanding
that
you're
going
to...
that
its
primary
or
maybe
exclusive
use
will
be
in
a
particular
way,
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
implied...
you
could
imply
a
license
by
those
facts
alone.
then
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
implication
has
in
some
sense
been
clearly
overridden
by
the
conduct
of
the
parties
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
once
he
received...
and
once
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
but
every...
every
sale
after--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
no,
but
that
just
means
that
the
patent--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
you
mean
both
intel
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
yes.
both
intel
and...
and
quanta
clearly
agreed...
i
mean,
both
intel
and
and
lg
clearly
agreed
to
that,
if
that's
what
you're
asking
about.
but
the...
but
the
point
here
is
that
the
notice
was
prior
to
the
sale.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
of
the
sale.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
when
else...
an
implied
license
clearly
can't
extend
to
the
ultimate
purchaser
until
the
ultimate
purchaser
gives
something.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
we
clearly
didn't
do
that.
that...
i
mean
that...
the
two
court
rulings
clearly
resolved
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
if
i
say
at
the
time,
"but
you
cannot
use
it
in
a
bicycle
because
it
has
a
separate
patent,
and
therefore--
"
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
that's
exactly
what
the
notice
says.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
goes
to
clear...
i
mean,
but
that
goes
to
the
clear
understanding...
i
mean
the
question
is...
if
the
question
is
did
intel
have
the
right
to
sell
the
system
as
a
system,
the
answer
is
yes.
it
was
licensed
to
do
that.
but
it
didn't
sell
the
system
as
a
system.
it
sold
the
components
of
the
system.
and
then
the
question
is,
does
it
have
as
a
consequence
of
that
some
kind
of
an
implied
license
to
do
this?
and
the
courts
below
both
specifically
held
no.
and
i
think
the
other
thing
about
this,
justice
scalia,
is
that
this
was
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
both
courts
below
held
that
that's
not
the
question
presented.
in
order
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
prevail,
they
have
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
an
exhaustion
concept.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
the
question
presented
in
the
petition.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
the
problem--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
so.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because,
because
it
ignores
the
fact
that
there
are
separate
patents
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
that...
there
is
an
issue.
i
mean
i
don't
think
there's
a
question
that...
you
know,
as
to
how
far
you
can
go
down
the
road
in
trying
to
condition
a
particular
sale.
i
thought
this
court
may
have
resolved
this
already.
mallinckrodt
leaves
that
issue
open,
but
that's
not...
that's
not
the
question.
the
issue
here
is
if
i
sell
to
you,
justice
souter,
a
particular
chip,
whether
i
condition
it
or
not,
i
think
that's...
to
me
that's
unenforceable.
but
the
question
is,
can
you
then
take
that
chip
and
use
it
to
violate
a
separate
patent?
and
the
reason
you
know
that
it's
not
exhaustion--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
later.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
let
me
further--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
that
clearly
understates
the
role
of
the
pto
in
granting
a
separate
patent.
i
mean,
this
is
not...
these
are
not
things
you
pick
up
at
the
corner
drugstore.
you
have
to
justify
them.
and
if
you
look
at
section
282,
"a
patent
shall
be
presumed
valid.
"
each
claim
shall
be
presumed
valid
independently
of
the
validity
of
other
claims.
and
there's
an
independence
that's
embedded
in
this
entire
scheme.
if
it's
true
that
the
pto
has
in
fact
granted
patent
rights
on
something
that's
fundamentally
not
different
from
the
other...
from
some
other
patent,
the
solution
to
that
is
a
validity
challenge.
and
candidly,
i
think
that's
exactly
what
all
of
those
arguments
are--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--is
patent
validity
challenges.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
all...
i'm
not...
i'm
not
particularly
criticizing
the
pto.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
statutory
scheme
presumes
that
there
is
a
separateness
when
a
patent
is
issued
and,
therefore...
and
which
is
why...
again,
the
first...
there's
no
reason
to
go
to
an
expansion
of
the
first-sale
doctrine
in
order
to
deal
with
the
kinds
of
problems
you
have
here
because
in
general...
in
general
you
can
deal
with
it
as
a
matter
of
implied
license,
but
that
issue
has
been
resolved
adverse
to
the
other
side
in
this
case,
and
there's
no
reason
to
sort
of
fill
in
that
void.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
from
intel
to
the
buyers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
that's...
that's
the
critical
component
of
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
buyer
would
have
to
assert
exhaustion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure,
intel
has
the
authority
to
sell
these
things,
and
it
has
the
authority
to
sell...
it
depends
on
what
the
things
are.
it
has
the
authority
to
sell
the
chips.
it
has
the
authority
to
sell
the
systems,
but
what
it
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
do
is
to
allow
somebody
downstream
to
take
the
chips
and
put
them
into
the
separately
patented
systems,
and
the...
and
the
people
downstream
know
that
they
don't
have
that
entitlement.
justice
souter,
to
me
the
patent-exhaustion
doctrine
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
it
shouldn't,
that
the
exhaustion
doctrine
should
be
retained
as
a
first-sale
doctrine
alone.
that's
the
way
it's
always
been
understood
for
150
years.
and
to
expand
it
this
way
is
to
undermine
the
rights
of...
in
the
separate
patents.
and
now
i'll
try
to
make
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
to
justice
souter.
read
the
reply
brief:
a
sale
authorized
by
one
patentee
does
not
exhaust
patents
held
by
a
different
patentee.
so
we
wouldn't
even
be
in
this
case
if
it
turned
out
that
we
didn't
just...
we
didn't
happen
to
have
all
of
these
rights
in
the
first
place.
i
mean,
if
they
bought
the
chips
and
if
wang
had
held
on
to
some
portion
of
the
system
patent
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
that
wang
would
have
the
full
opportunity...
that
sale
didn't
exhaust
their
rights
in
that
patent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean
there
can't...
there's
no
serious
basis
for
doubting
what
intel
knew
precisely
what
it
was
getting
in
this.
it
was
getting
peace
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
in
terms
of
litigation,
and
it
knew
that
there
were
separate
patents
here
and
that
when
it
sold
the
chips
it
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
assume
that
there
would
be
exhaustion.
that's
the
provision
you
read.
but
when
it
sells
the
chips,
it
didn't
know
and
it
specifically
gave
notice
that
it
recognized
that
that
doesn't
remotely
say
what
the
right
answer
is
with
respect
to
the
systems
and
with
respect
to
the
methods.
and
that
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
fundamental
distinction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's
part
of
the
reason
why
it
was
negotiated
in
that
way.
but
i
mean
that
is...
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
particular
issue
by
reference
to
that
particular
limitation.
the
reality
is
if
we
entered
into
the
same
agreement
with
amd,
which
is
one
of
the
other
chipmakers,
i
am
sure
they
would
ask
for
the
same
restriction
on
it:
that
you
could
only
do
it
with
amd
products,
as
well.
i
mean
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
underlying
problem
that
we
are
confronting
in
this
particular
context.
it
seems
to
me
the
fundamental
issue
here
is
they
have
a
limited
right
when
they
purchase
that
product.
they
didn't
get
the
right
to
make
other
products.
they
didn't
get
the
right
to
breach
or
infringe
a
completely
separate
patent.
and
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
all
that
is
before
the
court,
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean
they
recognized
specifically
that
these
are
completely
separate.
that
the
claims
that
are
at
issue
here
are
different
from
the
amounts
that
were...
from
the
products
that
were,
in
fact,
purchased.
so
the
elements,
the
constituent
elements,
they
have
clearly
embraced.
the
conclusion,
they
have
clearly
not
embraced.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
my--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
what
i
was
actually
saying
is
that
if
you
read
the
language
in
4a
and
5a
where
it
says:
the
patents
asserted
by
lge
do
not
cover
the
products
licensed
to,
or
sold
by,
intel.
they
have
to
be
combined
with
additional
components.
and
then
in
5a
they
say:
notably,
the
sale
involved
a
component
of
the
inserted,
patented
invention,
not
the
entire
patented
system.
so
they
recognize,
to
my
mind,
what
are
the
predicate
factual
bases
from
which
i
say
the
"exhaustion
doctrine"
shouldn't
have
been...
shouldn't
have
been
triggered.
but,
to
be
sure,
they...
they...
it
was
a
much
easier
task
for
them
because
they...
as
far
as
they
are
concerned,
all
kinds
of
conditions
are
permissible.
and
we
don't
need
that
in
order
to
win
this
case.
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
embrace
that
particular
approach.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
ask
you
to
affirm
the
decision.
