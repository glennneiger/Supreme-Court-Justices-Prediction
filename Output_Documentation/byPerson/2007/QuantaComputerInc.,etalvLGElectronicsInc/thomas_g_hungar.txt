mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
150
years
this
court
has
held
that
an
authorized
sale
removes
the
particular
item
sold
from
the
protection
of
the
patent
laws.
the
court
below
erroneously
transformed
that
patent-exhaustion
doctrine
from
a
definitional
principle
that
delimits
the
scope
of
the
patent
grant
into
an
optional
default
assumption
that
can
be
discarded
at
the
whim
of
the
patentee.
if
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct,
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
like
univis,
motion
picture
patents,
straus,
bauer
and
boston
store
would
have
to
have
gone
the
other
way,
because
in
each
of
those
cases
this
court
held
that
the
exhaustion
principle
overrode
express
restrictions
that
the
patentee
had
attempted
to
impose
on
after-sale
use
or
resale
by
an
authorized
purchaser.
this
court
should
follow
its
precedents
and
reaffirm
the
principle
that
the
patent-exhaustion
doctrine
precludes
a
patentee
from
employing
the
patent
law
to
enforce
post-sale
restrictions
on
use
or
resale
by
authorized
purchasers,
that
is--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we...
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
record
that
would
explain
that,
your
honor.
presumably
it's
because
congress
wanted
to
specify
particular
limits,
which
section
109
of
the
copyright
act
does.
it
wanted
to
specify
particular
limits
to
define
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
in
the
copyright
context
in
a
way
that
it
has
not
sought...
found
it
necessary
to
do
in
the
patent
area.
but
there's
no
legislative
history
about
this.
i
mean,
this
court
has
said
that
the
1952
act
codified,
recodified,
and
readopted,
reaffirmed,
the
principles
of
the
court's
cases
on
infringement
generally.
obviously--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i'm
not
aware
of
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1952
codification
on
the
subject
of
the
patent
exhaustion
doctrine
one
way
or
the
other;
but,
obviously,
congress
did
not
express
any
dissatisfaction
with
it.
it
did
change
certain
aspects
of
patent
law,
but
it
did
not
attempt
in
any
way
to
override
or
change
the
effect
of
the
first-sale
doctrine,
which
under
this
court's
cases
has
been
perfectly
clear
for
well
over
a
century
and
has
the
effect
we've
suggested.
and
we
submit
that,
although
the
respondent
essentially
ignores
or
runs
away
from
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals,
we
submit
it's
important
for
this
court
to
explicitly
address
and
explicitly
reject
the
federal
circuit's
misunderstanding
of
the
patent-exhaustion
doctrine,
its
view
that
a
patentee
can
essentially
override
it
simply
by
attaching
a
notice
to
the
article
that
has
been
sold
in
an
authorized
sale.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it
depends
a
little
bit
on
what
contract
we're
talking
about
and
what
it
says.
it
is
true,
as
justice
stevens
indicated,
it
has
always
been
true,
that
this
court
has
deemed
a
license
under
a
patent
to
be
different
from
a
sale
of
a
particular
article
under
a
patent.
it
is
the
sale
of
the
article
that
exhausts.
the
license
does
not...
exhaustion
doesn't...
isn't
relevant
at
the
mere
licensing
stage.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
only
at
the...
only
at
the
level
of
the
licensee.
that
is,
if
it
is
true,
as
ms.
mahoney
said,
if
the...
if
lg
here
had
given
a
restricted
license
that
restricted
the
right
to
sell,
that
said
you
can
only
sell
in
these
instances,
and
if
intel
then
sold
outside
those
permitted
instances,
that
would
be
patent
infringement.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
because
it
was
an
unauthorized
sale.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
that's
right.
if
this
had
been
an
authorized
sale...
i
mean
an
unauthorized
sale,
they
would
win.
but,
of
course,
it's
been
accepted
throughout
the
case,
and
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
said
at
page
5a,
and
it's
been
undisputed,
that
intel
had
the
right
to
sell
these
items
to
these
petitioners.
they
had
the
right
to
sell.
it
was
not
infringing.
and
if
it's
not
"infringing",
by
definition,
it's
an
"authorized"
sale.
it's
authorized
under
the
patent
explicitly
by
the
license
agreement.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
might
be
lawful.
you
could
certainly
do
what,
in
fact,
i
think
some
of
the
seed
companies--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
would
not
be
enforceable
as
a
matter
of
patent
law
against
the
authorized
purchaser.
if...
if
the
licensee
does
what
the
licensee
is
obligated
to
do,
it
imposes
the...
it
attaches
the
notice
or
it
requires
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well...
but,
your
honor,
it
all
goes
back
to
the
question:
was
there
an
authorized
sale
of
the
article
at
issue?
if
the
sale
is
authorized,
if
what
the
licensee--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
sale
from
the
licensee
to
the
purchaser.
the
license
is
not
a
sale...
is
not
a
sale
for
purposes
of
the
patent
exhaustion.
i
think
that
the
federal
circuit
was
just
wrong
in
saying
that,
because
what
the
patent-exhaustion
doctrine
talks
about
is
the
sale
of
an
article.
all
the
cases
say
the
sale
of
the
particular
article
removes
that
article
from
the...
from
the
patent
monopoly.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no.
what
we're
saying
is
this.
if...
if
the
licensee
has
a
restricted
license,
that
is
its
right
to
sell
is
restricted,
it
can
only
sell
on
mondays
and
not
on
tuesdays--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--and
it
sells
on
a
tuesday.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
fine.
if
they
have
that
restriction
and
they
sell
and
they
do
not...
they
do
not
obtain
the
contractual
promise
of
the
party
that
they
are
obligated
to
obtain,
they're
violating
the
terms
of
their
right
to
sell.
it's
patent
infringement
by
the
seller,
and
if
the
buyer
uses
it
it's
patent
infringement
by
them
as
well.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
because--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--if...
in
your
hypothetical,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
an
unauthorized
sale.
the
licensee
does
not
have
the
right
to
sell
under
the
patent
in
those
circumstances,
and
therefore
the
exhaustion
principle
does
not
apply.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct.
likewise,
what
happens
in
the
real
world
is
the
patentee,
if
the
patentee
wants
to
restrict
what
people
can
do
downstream,
they
say
to
the
licensee,
you
can
only
sell
if
you
obtain
a
contractual
promise
from
the
purchaser.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
in
if
those
circumstances,
if
quanta
had...
if
that...
if
that
license
condition--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but
let
me
be
clear.
the
key
distinction
is
between
an
authorized
sale
and
an
unauthorized
sale.
so
if
there
is
an
authorized
sale,
that
is,
intel--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i
think
i
haven't
been
clear,
because
i
want
to
make
sure
that
that
the
consequences
are
clear--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--correct,
and
it
would
be
patent
infringement.
but
if
they
sold
and
the
purchaser
did
agree,
they
did
enforce
that
requirement,
they
did
require
the
purchaser
to
sign
a
promise...
may
i
finish,
your
honor...
to
promise
to
limit
the
use
and
the
purchaser
then
violated
that
promise,
the
point
is
that
would
be
a
breach
of
contract
but
it
would
not
be
patent
infringement
because
the
sale
was
authorized,
the
patent
monopoly
ends
and
only
contract
principles
control
thereafter.
