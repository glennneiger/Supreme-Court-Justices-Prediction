justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
consider
that
in
your
case,
given
that
the
application
to
reopen
was
made
when
there
were
only
two
days
left
to
run
for
the
termination
of
the
voluntary
departure
time...
in
other
words,
it
was
your
delay,
not
the
government's,
that
made
it
impossible
to
decide
this
in
the
requisite
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't...
why
isn't
it
fair
to
say:
you
have
the
short
time
frame
by
statute
to
leave
the
country
if
you've
left
in
voluntary
departure.
yet,
the
government
has
provided
reopening
for
all
aliens.
okay.
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say
that,
by
asking
for
reopening
when
you've
gotten
permission
to
voluntarily
depart
within
"x"
days,
you
are
relinquishing
your
voluntary
departure
status?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
a
perfect
reconciliation
of
the
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
raised
the
question,
as
i
remember,
when
you
put
it
in
the
cert
petition.
the
government
advised
against
granting
on
that
question
and
limiting
it
to
the
question
of
having
it...
having
it
both
ways,
keeping
your
voluntary
departure
and
moving
to
reopen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
existed?
you're
not
saying
something
that
came
up
later?
what
was
the
ground
that
the,
in
this
case,
that
wasn't
brought
up
by
the
first
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
going
back
to
the
question
that
justice
alito
put
to
you,
that
he
would
then
be,
and
you
agree
this
is
what
you
asked
for
first,
like
any
other
removable
alien.
and
justice
alito
asked
you:
well,
then
he
could
be
removed
immediately,
is
that
not
so?
my
understanding
was,
yes,
that's
so,
but
you
can
move
for
a
stay
of
removal
when
you
have
a
reopening
pending.
is
that
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
why
did
the
government
advise
this
court
not
to
grant
cert
on
question
number
1,
which
was:
i
want
to
apply
to
reopen
and
simultaneously,
i
want
to
withdraw
my
voluntary
departure
and
be
just
like
any
other
removable
alien,
take
my
chances
just
like
anyone
else?
the
government
said
don't
present
that...
court,
don't
consider
that
question.
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
seems
that
this
litigant
said,
number
one,
i
don't
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
status
of
i
have
to
get
out,
but
i
can
do
so
voluntarily.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
do
is
to
move
to
reopen,
withdraw
my
voluntary
departure.
and
then
the
second
thing
was,
if
i
can't
do
that,
please
extend
my
voluntary
departure
time
while
i
move
to
reopen.
it
seems
that
this
litigant
is
being
put
in
a
bind
by
not
allowing
this
court
to
consider
what
was
the
alien's
first
preference,
that
is,
to
withdraw
the
voluntary
departure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
the
solution
to
withdraw,
relinquish
the
voluntary
departure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
the
provision
that
he
can
get
a
stay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
because
he
would
then
be
back...
if
he
stays
here
after
the
period
is
run,
then
he
has
relinquished
the
voluntary
departure.
he
is
like
any
removable--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
not
to
stay...
but
he
would
not
be
hanging
on
to
his
voluntary
departure.
that's
gone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
you
say...
you
say
that
under
the
current
regime,
the
voluntary
departure
application,
granted,
is
irrevocable.
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
regulations
don't
say
that.
the
regulations
are
just
blank.
it
doesn't
say
and
if
you
do
this
it's
irrevocable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
order
didn't
say
he
couldn't
withdraw?
