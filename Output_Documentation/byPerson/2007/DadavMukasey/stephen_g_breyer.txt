justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
appeal?
i
mean,
what
happens?
they
file
a
motion
to
reopen,
denied.
now,
can
they
appeal
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
and
how
much
time
does
that
take?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
but
how...
do
they
then
appeal
the
motion
to...
they
appeal
the
motion...
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
reopen
or
how
long...
where
do
they
go?
do
they
have...
this
is
the
board,
so
they
go
right
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
long
do
those
take
on
average?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
interested
in
the
problem.
i'm
interested
in
how
much
added
time
it
actually
means.
so
let's
go...
if
you
win,
how
much
additional
time
in
a
typical
case
would
the
alien
have
before
he
has
to
leave?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then,
and
then
do
you
in
addition
ask
for
cert
or
is
it
not
in
addition?
are
you
including
that
within
the
13
months?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
would
you
just
guess
on
the
basis
of
your
experience?
i'm
not
holding
you
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what
i'm
wondering
here,
and
this
is
because
i
see
two
contrary
things,
if
for
to
you
win
it
means
that
you
are
adding
an
average
of,
say,
400
days
to
a
stay
where
congress
said
we
want
you
to
stay
no
more
than
60
days
or
120?
that's
pretty
hard
for
me
to
reconcile,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
that's
the
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
having
a
lot
of
trouble
understanding
the
case,
because
it's
so
complicated.
if
you...
could
you
track
it
through
for
a
minute?
i
mean,
as
i
understand
this,
this
probably
doesn't
concern
people
who
want
to
voluntarily
depart
before
their
case
is
finished,
right?
where
they
don't
reopen
because
there
is
nothing
to
reopen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we're
at
a
person
who
is
before
the
board
or
before
the
hearing
examiner
and
he
wants
to...
he
is
now
got
a
final
order
against
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
now
you
say
to
him
i'll
tell
you
what
we'll
do
to
you:
you
leave,
go,
good-bye,
and
we'll
let
you
pursue
your
appeals
anyway,
but
from
out
of
the
country.
that's
true?
just
tell
me
if
i'm
getting
it
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
reopening.
i'm
talking
about
appeals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
can
you
go
to
court,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
no
problem.
you
say
go,
good-bye,
and
we'll
give
you
some
good
deals
here
if
you'll
really
go,
but
you
pursue
your
appeals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i'm
asking,
i'm
getting
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
motions
to
reopen
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
but
you
can
go
to
there?
you
go
to
the
bia?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
why
wouldn't
you
treat--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--cannot.
okay.
but
you
can
go
to
the
bia?
leaving
the
country?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
go
anywhere.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
lose
all
your
appeals,
not
just
your
motion-to-reopen
appeals
if
you
leave
the
country?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
okay.
so
you
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
your
basic
is...
don't
tell
me
if
i'm
right
if
i'm
wrong,
please.
the...
the...
what
i'm
thinking
your
basic
problem
or
position
is
and
why
you've
got
into
this,
is
because
you
think
any
really
meritorious
case
where
there
should
be
reopening
will
be
pointed
out
to
the
board
before
there
is
a
final
order
in
effect
and
before
voluntary
departure
becomes
an
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
we
decide
against
you,
then
you're
thinking,
well,
what
will
happen
in
every
case
is
after
there
is
a
final
order,
the
alien
will
move
for
a
motion
to
reopen
because
he
will
get
a
few
extra
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
gets
a...
several--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
i
got
it
right,
what
your
point
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
they
don't
provide
for
it,
and
they
don't
say
you
can't
do
it,
why
isn't
it
arbitrary
not
to
let
him
do
it?
i
mean...
what...
if
it's...
if
it's
arbitrary--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
sounds
almost
arbitrary
to
say
to
a
person,
look,
if
you
think
you
have
some
new
evidence
and
want
to
reopen,
do
it.
but
congress
wanted
you
to
get
out
of
here
in
respect
to
this
60
days,
so
you
have
to
give
up
that.
you're
not
getting
those
benefits.
now,
it's
a
tough
bargain,
but
it
seems
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
don't
see
is
to
say
once
you
ask
for
this
you
can
never
get
status
adjustment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
not
apply
them
to
this
person?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
about
this?
i'm
just
trying
this
out.
you
don't
have
to
respond
if
you
don't
want
to.
but
you
say,
look,
the
ag
in
his
rules
here,
really
tried
to
reconcile
the
two
interests
that
we
talked
about
in
our
prior
conversation.
now
hypothetically,
i
suppose
you
say
that
was
a
reasonable
way
of
going
about
this,
and
we
remand
for
consideration
about
whether
this
prior
situation
that
you
couldn't
do
that
was
arbitrary,
capricious,
abuse
of
discretion,
or
your
failure
to
apply
it
retroactively
to
a
certain
class
of
people
was
arbitrary,
capricious,
abusive
discretion?
