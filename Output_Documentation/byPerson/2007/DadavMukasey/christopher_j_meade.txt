mr.
christopher
j.
meade
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
provided
that
certain
aliens,
including
those
with
good
moral
character,
are
eligible
for
voluntary
departure.
congress
has
also
provided
that
all
aliens
may
file
one
motion
to
reopen
raising
new
facts
within
90
days.
the
question
is
how
to
reconcile
these
two
provisions.
the
parties
agree
on
two
key
points:
first,
the
government
agrees
that
the
statute
can
be
read
to
preserve
motions
to
reopen
for
voluntary
departure
recipients.
second,
the
government
agrees
that
such
aliens
can
file
a
motion
to
reopen;
and
if
the
immigration
official
happens
to
act
quickly
enough,
the
alien
will
receive
a
ruling.
but,
under
the
government's
view,
if
the
official
does
not
act
quickly
enough,
the
alien
is
denied
an
adjudication.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
have
two
responses,
one
relating
to
this
particular
case
as
well
as
the
cases
in
general.
but,
as
to
this
particular
case,
mr.
dada
found
new
counsel,
which
took
a
week;
and
in
the
remaining
time
he
prepared
a
motion
to
reopen
with
80
pages
of
exhibits
including
affidavits,
five
letters,
medical
documents,
financial
records
including
tax
returns.
and
that's
why
it
took
an
additional
two-and-a-half
weeks
to
do
the
motion
to
reopen.
but,
as
a
general
matter,
aliens
file
at
different
periods
during
the
period.
for
example,
in
the
eleventh
circuit
case
of
ugokwe
the
alien
filed
with
30
days
left
in
the
period,
and
the
government,
the
agency,
didn't
act
in
time.
but
what
happens
in
the
agency
is
that
motions
to
reopen
are,
in
fact,
decided
relatively
quickly...
just
not
quickly
enough.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
how
many--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--we've
looked
for
that
statistic,
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
statistic.
however,
there
are
numerous
cases
presenting
very
sympathetic
facts
which
show
grants
of
motions
to
reopen.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes,
i
do.
as
a
general
matter,
there
are
10,000
motions
to
reopen
filed,
but
that's
for
all
aliens,
for
all
removal
proceedings.
since
voluntary
departure
is
roughly
10
percent
of
all
removals,
we
estimate
that's
roughly
a
thousand
motions
to
reopen
filed
by
voluntary
departure
recipients.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
not
necessarily.
there
are...
the
statute
governs
when
a
motion
to
reopen
is
proper,
and
the
attorney
general
determined,
even
under
the
previous
statutory
scheme--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
two
responses:
first,
there
are
sanctions
for
frivolous
filing
under
the
immigration
proceedings.
second,
the
attorney
general,
under
the
old
regime
that
wasn't
tightened...
the
attorney
general
concluded
that
there
was
no
pattern
of
abuse
of
motions
to
reopen.
and,
third,
going
forward,
this
is
not
a
risk
because--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--when
you
say
that
they're
not
diligently
pursuing
their
rights,
i
am
not
clear--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--generally,
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes.
not
necessarily
equitable
tolling,
but,
yes,
automatic
tolling
under
the
statute.
but
to
show
quickly--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--that--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
the
option
that
the
government
is
proposing
prospectively.
it
is
also
something
that
my
client
requested
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
before
the
board,
before
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
cert
petition,
and
in
our
opening
brief.
that
is
one
way
to
reconcile
the
two
statutory
provisions
which
the
government
is
proposing
on
an
ongoing
basis
that
will
not
apply
to
our
client.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
that
regulation
is
subject
to
litigation.
that
would
be
another
way
to
solve
the
problem
as
you
suggest.
it
would
be--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--excuse
me?
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
it
was
not
directly
challenged
because
the
fifth
circuit
is
one
of
the
circuits
that
says
that
the
motion...
that
regulation
is
valid.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
your
honor,
as
to
voluntary
departure
recipients,
this
court
can
construe
the
statute
to
avoid
the
conflict
here.
and,
moving
forward,
the
government
has
a
proposed
solution
which,
if
adopted,
will
resolve
the
question
on
an
ongoing
basis.
some
of
the
examples
of
the
facts
that
arise
in
motions
to
reopen
are
seen
in
various
cases.
for
example,
a
child
newly
diagnosed
with
mental
disabilities
as
in
the
azarte
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
a
parent
newly
diagnosed
with
health
problems
as
in
the
bia
case
of
diaz
mucho--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--with
respect,
that's
not
an
option
to
our
client.
our
client
tried
to
do
that,
but
was
not
permitted.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
the
problem
is
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
motion
to
reopen.
a
motion
to
reopen,
by
its
very
nature,
is
based
on
changed
circumstances,
circumstances
that
were
not
available
at
the
original
time
of
the
hearing.
so
a
person
could
enter
and
accept
voluntary
departure
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
and,
because
of
circumstances
that
change,
that,
by
definition,
he
or
she
could
not
have
known
about,
is
then
in
a
bind
when
he
wants
to--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--the
circumstances
here
is
that
previous
counsel
had
failed
to
submit
an
application
and
supporting
evidence.
and
under
the
bia
case
law
that's
a
proper
vehicle
for
a
motion
to
reopen.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
it
was
a
file
for
adjustment
of
status,
an
application
for
adjustment
of
status
and
supporting
documents,
as
well
as
the
supporting
evidence
showing
that
this
was
a
bona
fide
marriage.
and
the
bia
has
numerous
cases
which
says
that
a
motion
to
reopen
of
this
type
is
a
valid
motion
to
reopen.
now,
of
course,
the
agency
didn't
rule
on
whether
the
facts
did
or
not...
did
or
did
not
need
a
motion
to
reopen.
so
that
question
isn't
before
the
court.
but
the
other
cases
show
the
various
kinds
of
tracks
that
come
up
to
establish
a
motion
to
reopen
and
why
it's
an
important
part
of
the
immigration
process.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
justice
souter,
that's
unclear.
the
agency
didn't
ask...
didn't
answer
that
in
the
first
instance.
there
has
never
been
a
reason
given
throughout
the
entire
litigation,
and
now
there
is
some
irony--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
it
wasn't
the
ij.
it
was
before
the
board.
it
was
presented
to
the
board,
and
the
board's
order
only
said
he
is
ineligible
for
this
relief
because
he
has
overstayed
the
voluntary
departure
period.
but
there
is
some
irony--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
the
agency
has
never
given
a
reason
for
why
they
did
not
accept
the
withdrawal,
although
there
is
some
irony
in
the
fact
that
the
proposed
solution
going
forward
would
give
aliens
exactly
what
my
client
asked
for
if
the
agency--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
it
wouldn't
have
mooted
the
motion
to
reopen.
motions
to
reopen
are
available
to
all
aliens
subject
to
a
final
order,
including
criminal
aliens,
including
some
accused
of
terrorism.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
not
once
he
had
left
the
united
states.
but
all
my
client
wants...
all
my
client
wanted
at
that
time
was
to
be
placed
in
the
same
circumstance
as
all
other
aliens
subject
to
a
final
ruling.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
have
three
responses,
justice
scalia.
first,
i'll
agree
that
the
alien
can
file
the
motion
to
reopen.
the
only
question
is
whether
it's
going
to
be
adjudicated
in
time.
second,
as
for
the
question
of
the
bargain,
whether
giving
up
appeals
is
part
of
the
bargain,
all
parties
agree
that
an
alien
who
accepts
voluntary
departure
can
continue
to
appeal
to
the
board,
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
only,
the
only
adjudicatory
process
that
the
government
says
that
my
client
is
not
entitled
to
now
is
one
motion
to
reopen.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
one
final--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--one
final
response
is
that
in
the
government's
proposed
regulation,
an
alien
is
permitted
to
file
a
motion
to
reopen
notwithstanding
having
been
granted
voluntary
departure,
which
indicates
that
the
government
itself
does
not
think
that
the
bargain
includes...
or
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
bargain
to
include
a
waiver
of
the
one
motion
to
reopen
which
all
aliens
are
entitled
to
file.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes.
if
you
have
a
final
order
of
removal,
yes,
you
can
file
for
a
stay
once
you
have
a
final
order.
so
my
client
is
in
a
worse
position.
because
he's
under
the
voluntary
departure
grant,
he
cannot
get
the
same
ability
for
a
stay
that
those
who
are
subject
to
a
final
removal.
so
the
irony
is--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--i--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
the
problem,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
agency
would
need
to
act
within
the
short
time
period.
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--that's
true,
justice
kennedy.
but
that's
essentially
the
same
action
that
would
be
needed
to
decide
the
motion
to
reopen
in
the
first
place.
motions
to
reopen
are
discretionary.
they
go
to
the
same
board
member
that
had
decided
the
original
appeal.
so
it
does
not
take
much
time
or
effort
for
the
agency
to
be
able
to
decide
these,
as
is
reflected
by
the
general
time
periods
for
adjudication.
for
example,
in
the
dekoladeno
case
on
the
fourth
circuit,
the
motion
was
decided
in
23
days.
in
the
sidikhouya
case
out
of
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--it's
a
discretionary
determination
to
the
single
board
member.
and
the
board
member
could
deny
the
motion
to
reopen,
even
when
there's
a
prima
facie
case.
all
they
have
to
do
is
look
to
see
if
it...
in
the
subset
of
cases
that
the
agency,
exercising
its
own
discretion,
where
they
agree
that
a
motion
to
reopen
is
proper.
and
all
we're
asking
for
in
this
case,
not
special
procedures,
not
anything
added
to
the
motion
to
reopen
process,
but
only
the
right
to
have--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
reopen,
at
that
point
there
would
be
a
final
order
in
effect.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
one
difference,
though,
between
petitions
for
review
and
motions
to
reopen
is
that
petitions
for
review
can
be
decided
from
outside
the
country
under
the
1996
amendments.
and
motions
to
reopen
under
the
agency's
regulations,
cannot.
so
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
ability
for
an
alien--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--petitions
for
review
take
longer.
according
to
the
agency's
current
regulations,
they
take
approximately,
i
believe,
13
months
or
so
is
what
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--your
honor,
i
don't
have
those
exact
statistics.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
there
might
be
cases
where
alien
seek
cert
as
well.
but
for
the
most
part--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
one
of
the
answers
on
that
question
on
the
petition
for
review
front
is
exactly
what
the
government
has
proposed
in
its
rule
going
forward,
which
is
that
an
alien
who
has
voluntary
departure
can
file
a
petition
for
review,
but
by
doing
so
the
voluntary
departure
grant
terminates
and
they're
in
the
same
position
as
other
aliens,
on
the
same
level
playing
as
other
aliens.
that's
the
solution
being
proposed
by
the
government
going
forward,
and
as
to
the
petition
for
review
hypothetical
that
would
also
apply.
that
would
just
put
my
client
in
the
same
position
as
all
other
aliens,
including
criminal
aliens.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
just
for
the
motion,
just
for
the
time
that
the
motion
to
reopen
is
decided.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
thank
you
for
the
correction,
justice
scalia.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no,
chief
justice
roberts.
the
difference
is
that
petitions
for
review
can
be
adjudicated
from
outside
the
country,
so
whether
the
alien
is
here
or
abroad
he
can
get
an
adjudication
of
his
motion...
of
his
petition
for
review,
and
that
was
a
change
under
the
1996
act.
the
problem
for
motions
to
reopen
is
that
an
alien
cannot
receive
an
adjudication
at
all.
he
can't
stay.
he
can't
go.
there's
no
way
for
those
new
facts.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes,
that's
true.
that
is
not...
that
is
by
regulation,
although
that
regulation
applies
to
all
motions
to
reopen,
not
just
for
the
subset
of
motions
to
reopen
or
voluntary
departure
recipients.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no.
the
problem
is
that
for
an
alien,
for
many
aliens
covered
by
voluntary
departure,
once
they
leave
the
country
they
are
subject
to
various
unlawful
presence
bars.
so
by
leaving
the
country
these
bars
are
triggered
and
they
cannot
get
the
same
relief
from
outside
the
country.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
even
with
voluntary
departure.
leaving
the
country
triggers
these
bars.
once
you're
outside
the
country
you
cannot
reapply
for
admission
for
in
some
cases
up
to
10
years,
and
that
precludes
the
ability
to
leave
the
country
and
seek
the
relief,
even
if
you
have
a
marriage
to
a
united
states
citizen,
even
if
there
are
extreme
circumstances
in
a
particular
case
that
need
to
be
addressed
and
that
would
be
addressed
under
a
motion
to
reopen.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
absolutely.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no.
we
just
want...
under
the,
under
the
question...
under
the
government's
proposed
rule
or
under
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--right.
well,
the
tolling
solution,
the
tolling
construction,
would
permit
tolling
during
the
voluntary
departure
period
and
during
the
voluntary
departure
period
there
is
no
final
order
in
effect.
so
yes,
it
would
toll
the
time
for
leaving
the
country.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes.
that's
governed
by
the
agency's
own
regulations
that
say
that
there's
no...
the
ultimate
order
of
deportation
does
not
go
into
effect
until
an
overstay
of
a
voluntary
departure
period.
one
thing
that
is--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
you're
absolutely
right.
i
was
addressing
the
tolling
construction
with
mr.
chief
justice.
but
as
to
the
government's
proposed
rule
under
the
proposed
rule
and
what
my
client
asks
for,
the
time...
the
alien
would
be
automatically
subject
to
a
final
order
and
could
be
deported
involuntarily
so
long
as
the
alien
did
not
get
and
obtain
a
stay
of
deportation
from
the
agency
or
the
court,
so
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
if
the
agency
acted
quickly
enough
and
involuntarily
deported
someone
within
that
time--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
that
that
regulation
is
problematic,
although
the
court
does
not
need
to
address
it
in
this
case.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
the
government's
arguments
on
the
statutory
interpretation
in
this
case
are
undermined
by
its
own
proposed
rule
for
at
least
five
reasons.
first,
their
proposed
rule
makes
clear
that
the
government
agrees
that
the
statute
can
be
read
to
have
multiple
meanings.
second,
the
proposed
rule
makes
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
voluntary
departure
recipients
to
waive
the
motion
to
reopen
in
accepting
voluntary
departure.
third,
the
rule
stresses
the
importance
of
motions
to
reopen
and
their
importance
in
bringing
changed
facts
to
the
agency's
attention.
fourth,
the
proposed
rule
turns
on
unilateral
action
of
the
alien
and
permits
that
unilateral
action
to
terminate
the
voluntary
departure
grant.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
my
understanding
is
that
the
time,
that
the
time
is
actually
relatively
short,
that
they
are
generally
decided
within
90
days.
they're
procedures
passed
by
the...
by
regulation
which
indicate
that
they
go
to
the
same
board
member.
there
has
been
streamlining
procedures
by
the
agency
in
the
early
2000,
2001,
2002
period
which
helped
expedite
these.
and
actually,
the
time--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--i
do
not
think
that
there
will
be
many
additional
motions
to
reopen,
if
that
happens.
certainly,
if
the
government
has
a...
if
the
proposed
rule
is
adopted,
the
number
of
motions
to
reopen
will
not
be
affected,
because
prospectively,
the
solution...
the
problem
will
have
been
solved,
and
this
case
we'll
only
be
dealing
with
people
in
the
pipeline,
people
who
have
already
made
decisions
about
whether
to
file
a
motion
to
reopen
or
not.
so
assuming
that
the
government's
proposed
rule
is
enacted
in
anything
like
its
proposed
form,
then
there
will
be
no
problem
going
forward.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no,
that's
not
correct,
with
respect.
under
the
government's
proposed
rule,
the
alien
would
be
placed
in
the
same
position
as
other
aliens
and
would
be...
and
there
would
be
no
additional
incentive
to
file
a
motion
to
reopen.
under
the
government's
proposed
rule,
the
period
would
not
toll,
the
voluntary
departure
grant
would
expire,
and
the
alien
would
be
placed
in
the
same
position
as
otherwise--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--our
interpretation
is
the
statute
is
subject
to
multiple
interpretations.
but
the
one
thing
that
the
statute
does
not
permit
is
the
solution,
the
construction
that's
being
proposed
by
the
government
in
this
case.
the
government...
the
statute
would
permit
tolling.
the
statute
permits
reconciling
the
provisions
as
the
government
proposes
going
forward.
but
the
one
thing
that
the
statute
does
not
permit
is
the
government's
position
in
this
particular
litigation.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
the
motions
to
reopen
are
subject
to
statutory
and
regulatory
limits.
moreover,
the
time
period--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--i'm
saying
that
there...
aliens
could
choose
to
do
so,
but
i
disagree
that
there
would
be
a...
many
additional
motions
to
reopen.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes.
that's
part
of
the
answer,
yes,
justice
scalia.
but
in
addition,
the
length
of
time
of
adjudication
is
entirely
within
the
agency's
control.
it
can
take
two
days,
two
weeks,
two
months,
or
if
it
takes
longer--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--no.
but
the
answer
is
that
there...
it
is
within
their
control,
so
the
length
of
tolling
under
any
tolling
rule
is
not
within
the
control
of
the
alien.
it's
within
the
control
of
the
agency.
this
court...
as
to
your
question,
justice
alito,
on
the...
with
the
regulations
with
respect
to
withdraw
in
this
case,
the
agency
is
silent
on
that.
it's
unclear
to
me
why
the
agency...
may
i
finish...
it's
unclear
why
the
agency
did
not
give
my
client
the
request
he
requested,
and
we
ask
that
this
court
either
grant
tolling
or
interpret
the
statute
consistent
with
the
government's
proposed
rule.
