if
an
alien
has
not
been
diligently
pursuing
his
or
her
rights,
you
would
argue
the
person
was
still
entitled
to
equitable
tolling
if
the
alien
files
a
motion
to
reopen?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
generally
a
requirement
for
equitable
tolling:
a
person
has
to
have
been
diligently
pursuing
his
rights?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
don't
advocate
the
adoption
of
that
here.
you
say
if
you
file
a
petition...
a
motion
to
reopen,
you
get
automatic
equitable
tolling.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
voluntary
withdrawal
had
been
withdrawn
successfully,
he
would
then
have
been
subject
to
the
alternate
order
of
removal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
he
could
have
been
removed
immediately?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that
would
have
mooted
the
motion
to
reopen,
wouldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
it
remain
pending
once
he
had
left
the
united
states?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
basis
for
the
rule
that
an
alien
can't
withdraw,
can't
seek
to
withdraw
a
request
for
voluntary
departure?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
is
no
regulation
that
prohibits
it.
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
your
position
that
the
statute
requires
tolling?
