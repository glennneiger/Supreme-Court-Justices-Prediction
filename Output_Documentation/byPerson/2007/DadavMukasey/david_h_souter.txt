justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
wasn't
directly
challenged
here,
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
regulation
was
not
directly
challenged
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
meade,
why
was
your
client
not
allowed
to
withdraw
the
voluntary
departure
option,
withdraw
from
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
all
we
have
on
the
record
is
just
an
ij's
determination
that
he
would
not
accept
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at
the
time
he
filed,
he
had
not
overstayed,
because
he
filed
on
friday
afternoon,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
maybe
the
point
is
we
didn't
have
time
to
rule
on
it
simply
because
he
filed
it
on
friday
afternoon
and
he
had
to
leave
on
sunday,
and
therefore,
we
should
not
take
that
as
a
determination
that
had
he
filed
in
time
for
timely
action
by
the
court
he
would
have
been
denied.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be.
but
congress
passed
a
statute
that
grants
a
statutory
right
to
file
a
motion
to
reopen
no
matter
what
the
relief
is.
and
the
thing
that
seems
strange
to
me,
i
guess
to
carry
justice
scalia's
question
one
step
further,
is
what
seems
strange
to
me
is
that
congress
would
have
granted
that
right
in
effect
across
the
board,
regardless
of
what
the
reason
for
the
reopening
might
be
and
yet
would
have
done
so
knowing
that
the,
that
the
time
for
adjudication
before
the
ij
is
likely
to
take
longer
than
the
period
of
the,
prior
to
the
moment
of
required
departure.
it
sounds
as
though
congress
on
your
view
would
be...
would
have
been
giving
a
right
to
reopen
that
in
practical
terms
in
most
cases
will
avail
the
alien
absolutely
nothing
because
he'll
have
to
get
out
before
there
can
be
an
adjudication.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
isn't
the
question
in
this
case
whether
what
congress
did
was
as
modest
as
you
say?
because
if
it
is
as
modest
as
you
say,
then
in
at
least
a
substantial
category
of
cases
in
which
a
motion
to
reopen
will
be
filed,
it
will
in
fact
be
no
time
in
the
real
world
to
act
on
that
motion
before
the
voluntary
departure
date.
and
the
question
is
did
congress
really
intend
a
right
to
reopen
that
is
as
modest
as
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
seems
strange
that
it
would
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was...
was
the
regulation...
was
the
current
regulation
in
place
at
the
time
of
the
'96
act,
that
the...
that
the
departure
of
the
alien,
whatever
the
term
is,
waives
the
motion
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so,
we
assume
that
congress
knew
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
then
congress
knew
at
the
time
of
the
'96
act
that,
if
in
fact
the
motion
to
reopen
was
filed
in
the
normal
course,
it
probably
couldn't
be
heard
prior
to
the
date
at
which
(a)
the
alien
either
will
overstay
and
be
in
trouble
for
that
or
(b)
will
have
departed
and,
under
the
existing
regulatory
regime,
have
forfeited
his
right
to
reopen.
and
it's
the
strangeness
that
congress
would
want...
would
have
wanted
to
extend
the
right
to
reopen
to
a
statutory
level
under
these
circumstances
unless
it
contemplated
some
kind
of
a
tolling
scheme
that
would
avoid
this
sort
of
kafka-esque
result.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
can't
get
to
court
if
you
haven't
been
to
the
bia,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
and,
again,
we
are
talking
about
a
short
period
of
time,
like
30
days.
in
practical
terms
there's
no
way
he
is
going
to
get
through
the
bia
in
30
days.
and,
therefore,
when
he
leaves
the
country,
he
cannot
then
try
to
get
or
complete
his
bia
review,
and
he
therefore
will
have
no
chance
to
get
into
court,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
you
could.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
by
doing
that
you
do
preserve
your
right
to
appeal;
and
you
will
preserve
your...
will
you
also
preserve
your
right
to
go
to
court
if
you
lose
in
front
of
the
bia.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
we
got
that
straight.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
reason
he
could
not
unilaterally
relinquish
the
voluntary
departure
status
as
distinct
from
having
to
get
approval
from
the
board
or
bureaucrat?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
address
the
issue,
and
my
question
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
board
is
saying,
look,
i'm
granting
your
request...
we
are
granting
your
request
for
a
voluntary
departure
status
and
there
are
certain
consequences
that
that
status
carries.
he
is
saying,
on
my
hypothesis,
i
relinquish
that
status.
why
are
conditions
that
attach
when
he
has
the
status
an
indication
that
he
cannot
voluntarily
relinquish
that
status
without
further
action
by
the
board?
