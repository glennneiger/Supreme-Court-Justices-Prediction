mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
reopen
does
not
automatically
suspend
the
obligation
of
an
alien
to
leave
the
united
states
within
the
time
that
was
specified
in
the
board's
order
granting
permission
to
depart
voluntarily.
the
grant
of
voluntary
departure
reflects
an
exchange
of
benefits
between
the
government
and
the
alien
and
petitioner's
automatic
tolling
rule
would
greatly
subvert
that
reciprocal
arrangement
by
giving
the
alien
the
unilateral
and
automatic
ability
to
extend
the
substantive
terms
of
the
immigration
relief
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
let
me
make
one--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--let
me
make
one
point
clear
at
the
outset.
petitioner's
motion
to
reopen
was
not
dismissed
because
he
was
not
able
to
file
one.
it
was
denied
because
he
was
not
eligible
for
the
underlying
substantive
relief
that
he
requested
in
this
motion.
overstaying
a
voluntary
departure
period
does
not,
for
example,
bar
an
alien
from
obtaining
asylum
or
withholding
of
removal
on
a
motion
to
reopen.
it's
only
the
particular
substantive
form
of
relief
that
he
requested
in
his
motion
to
reopen
that
is
at
issue,
and
that
was
denied.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
all
respect,
that's
not
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
again,
both
prior
to
1996
and
after
1996
congress
specified
that
an
alien
who
overstays
the
voluntary
departure
period
is
ineligible
for
three
forms
of
discretionary
relief.
now
it's
voluntary
departure,
cancellation
or
removal,
or
adjustment
of
status.
that
was
true
both
beforehand
and
afterhand.
before
1996,
there
was
no
statutory
limitation
on
the
time
for
either
a
motion
to
reopen
or
voluntary
departure.
congress
was
concerned
about
abuses
on
both
of
those
fronts,
and
what
it
did
in
1996
was
to
compress
the
voluntary
departure
time
for
60
days
because
it
was
concerned
about
how
long
the
agency
was
allowing
agents...
aliens
to
remain
in
the
country
under
orders
of
voluntary
departure.
and
what
it
did
with
respect
to
motions
to
reopen
was
very
modest.
it
just
put
in
statutory
form
a
limitation
that
the
agency
had
put
in
place
pursuant
to
a
statutory
directive
to
place
time
and
number
limitations
on
motions
to
reopen
because
of
congress's
concern
about
abuse.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--two
responses
to
that.
with
respect
to
the
voluntary
departure,
congress
anticipated
that
the
alien
was
going
to
leave
under
the
order
of
voluntary
departure,
not
remain
here.
and
prior
to
1996,
just
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
regulation
has
been
a
fundamental
part
of
motions
to
reopen
going
back
at
least
until
the
1960s.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
yes,
we
do
have.
and
that's
part
of
the
arrangement.
the
only
thing...
and
that
regulation
was
repromulgated
as
part
of
general
motion
to
reopen
regulation
in
1995.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
again,
if
i
may,
the...
what
congress
had
in
mind
with
the
deal
of
granting
voluntary
departure
was
it
greatly
constricted
the
time
to
leave.
you
have
to
leave
in
60
days,
and
if
you
don't
leave
in
60
days,
you're
not
going
to
get
voluntary
departure
adjustment
of
status
or
cancellation
or
removal.
it
didn't
affect
the
eligibility
for
other
substantive
relief
that
an
alien
might
file
for
in
a
motion
to
reopen,
such
as
asylum,
such
as
if
he
has
new
evidence
going
to
the
ground
of
removal.
but
congress
was
particularly
concerned
not
to
allow
these
three
forms
of
discretionary
relief
to
remain
available.
and
so
i
think
congress
necessarily
would
have
been
unconcerned
about
whether,
if
an
alien
did
file
a
motion
to
reopen
within
that
greatly
constricted
60-day
period...
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
board
gave
30
days...
congress
wasn't
concerned
about
preserving
the
underlying
substantive
eligibility
for
those
forms
of
discretionary
relief,
because
it
made
that
part
of
the
deal,
that
alien
was
giving
up
if
he
left...
if
he
didn't
leave
the
country,
he
was
giving
up
that.
those
were
lesser
order
forms
of
relief
that
congress
was
making
available,
but
it
did
did
not
take
away,
for
example,
the
right
to
apply
for
asylum
or
withholding.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
that
had
not
been...
led
to
widespread
litigation
in
the
courts.
this
automatic
tolling
rule
is...
was
what
we
were
fundamentally
concerned
about.
in
fact,
we
told
the
court
not
to
take
the
case
at
all
because
the
new
regulations
were
under
consideration.
but
that
particular
provision...
issue
has
not
generated
that
much
litigation.
this
automatic
tolling
rule
has,
and
more
than--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
court
rewrote
the
question
presented
so
as
not
to...
not
to
address
that,
so
i
think
it's
not
before
the
court
right
here.
but...
but
beyond
that,
the
deal,
the
arrangement...
the
attorney
general
has
a
lot
of
discretion
how
to
implement
the
voluntary
departure
provision.
in
fact,
he
has
the
authority
to
eliminate
voluntary
departure
for
additional
categories
of
people
who
are
not
eligible
under
the
statute
itself.
so
whether
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
regulations
do
not
provide
for
it,
and
it's
inconsistent
with
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
far
as
i'm
aware
there
is
no
regulation
that
prohibits
it,
but
the
order
is
a
grant
of
voluntary
departure,
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
order
says
you're
granted
permission
to
depart
voluntarily
within
30
days;
if
you
do
not,
the
following
consequences
flow
from
that.
nothing
in
the
board's
order
would
allow
the
alien
to
avoid
those
consequences
by
saying
on
the
28th
day,
after
all
i
don't
want
to
do
that.
and
this
matter
of
implementing
the
voluntary
departure
agreement
is
part
of
a
general
scheme
of
a
quid
pro
quo
between
the
alien
and
the
united
states.
the
voluntary
departure
is
granted
under
circumstances
where
the
alien
doesn't
have
that
option.
so
unilaterally...
allowing
the
alien
unilaterally
to
do
that
now
is
not
provided
for.
now,
that
doesn't...
that
doesn't
take
away
from
the
attorney
general's
discretionary
authority
in
implementing
the
act
to
provide
for
that,
which
is
what
he
has
proposed
in
the
new
rule.
but
this
case
has
to
be
decided
under
the...
under
the
rules
that
are
now
in
effect.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
but
the
people--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
he...
if
he
leaves
the
country,
i
believe
he
can
still
appeal
to
the
bia.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
justice
breyer,
under
the
statutory
review
provisions,
you
can...
you
can
petition
for
review
and
leave
the
country
and
still
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
i
could
just
correct.
i'm
incorrect
that
you
can
have
your
appeal
adjudicated
if
you
leave
the
country.
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
understand
that.
the
appeal
from
the
immigration
judge
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
where
you
go
after--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i've
been
informed
that
you...
that
if
you
leave
the
country,
you
cannot
pursue.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
you
can't...
you
can't
go
to
the
bia.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
you
can't...
you
cannot
go
to
the
bia.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
your
administrative
appeals.
you
do
not...
the
statute
has
been
amended
to
allow
you
to
petition
for
review
in
a
court
if
you
leave
the
country.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
which
was
a
change
from
what
was
before
this
court
in
stone.
in
1996
congress
amended
the
act
to
allow
an
alien
to
continue
to
challenge
the
final
removal
order
after
he
leaves
the
country
in
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
believe...
i
believe
that's
true
unless--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that...
i
think
that
would
be
correct
unless...
i
don't
think
this
has
ever
come
up
that
i'm
aware
of,
about
whether
you
could
go
to
court
from
an
immigration
judge's
decision
where
you've
left
the
country
and
therefore
can't
appeal
to
the
bia.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
just
don't
know
the
answer...
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
because
i'm
not
sure
that
scenario
has
come
up,
because
usually,
if
somebody
wants
to
contest,
they're
not
going
to
leave
the
country
before
they
have
to,
and
if
you
appeal
from
the
immigration
judge
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
that
suspends
the
finality
of
the
order
of
removal
or
the
order
of
voluntary
departure
that
the
immigration
judge
has
entered.
so
if
you
appeal...
if
you
want
to
stay
in
the
country,
all
you
have
to
do
is
file
an
automatic
appeal
with
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
that
suspends
the
finality
of
the
departure
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
you
do.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
you
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
a
motion
to
reopen
arises
only
after
the
board
has
issued
a
final
order
on
your
appeal.
so
if
you
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
if
the
board
rejects
your
claim
on
the
merit,
and
reinstates
the
voluntary
departure
period
to
allow
you
to
enter
again--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
until
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
the
immigration
judge.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
i
suppose
you
could
do
that,
but
the...
but
the
appeal...
it
would
be
like
a
motion
to
reopen
in
the
district
court
while
you've
got
an
appeal
to
the...
to
the
bia.
i...
i
think
once
the
appeal
goes
to
the
board...
this
case
involves
motions
to
reopen
filed
with
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
not
with
the
immigration
judge,
and
so...
the
alien
here
conceded
his
deportability,
sought
a
continuance,
and
that
was
denied.
he
had
no
other
substantive
grounds
of
relief.
he
asked
for
voluntary
departure.
that
was
granted.
he
took
an
appeal
to
the
bia
arguing
he
should
have
been
granted
a
continuance;
the
board
affirmed;
reinstated
a
30-day
departure
period;
and
then
he
wanted
to
seek
reopening.
and
one
question
that
justice
breyer
asked
about,
what
if
reopening
is
denied
would
the
automatic
tolling
rule
continue?
i
suppose
the
alien
could
file
a
motion
to
reconsider
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
reopen,
and
if
you
had
an
automatic
tolling
rule,
it
would...
it
would
last
as
long
as
it
took
the
board
to
act
on
the
motion
to
reopen,
which
is...
which
60,
90,
120
days.
in
this
past
fiscal
year
the
board
on
motions
to
reopen
resolved
i
think
only
about
55
percent
of
those
within
90
days.
the
board
has
a
huge
backlog,
and
we're
talking...
and
so
we
are
talking
about
the
very
kind
of
abuse
of
the
immigration
system
that
this
court
was
concerned
about--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that...
that's
true.
it
has--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
although--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
it's
not
subject
to
the
appeal
as
such
but
the
board
procedures
take
account
of
developments
that
happen
while
the
case
is
on
appeal,
which
is
that
you
can
file
with
the
board
while
your
appeal
is
pending
and
ask
for
a
motion
to
remand
on
the
ground
that
new
evidence
has
come
up.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
adjustment
of
status,
where...
the
alien's
wife
has
filed
a
petition
for
immediate
relative
status
to
let
the
alien
get
a
visa,
if
while
the
case
is
pending
on
appeal
that
petition
has
been
granted,
then...
then
it
would...
then
all
the
alien
has
to
do
is
file
a
motion
with
the
board
and
say
there
is
new
information;
please
remand
it
back
to
the
immigration
judge.
so
a
lot
of
times
what
has
happened
is...
maybe
intervening
things
have
happened
but
the
alien
doesn't
do
anything
about
it
during
the
year
that
the
appeal
is
pending
with
the
board
of
immigration
appeals;
then
there
is
a
final
order
and
the
alien
rushes
in
with
the...
with
the
new
information
at
that
point,
where
if
you
had
only
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
board
while
the
appeal
was
pending,
it
could
have
been
remanded.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that...
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
more
than
a
few
extra
days.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
an
automatic
tolling
period.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
that
is
correct
and
i...
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
if
you're
talking
about
changed
circumstances
or
new
evidence
that
arises
after
the
ij
has
rendered
his
decision,
that's
a
period
that
might
be
a
year;
it
might
be
a
year
and
a
half.
new
developments
or
changed
circumstances
are
far
more
likely
to
have
happened
during
that
period
of
time
than
they
would
during
a
30-day
period
of
voluntary
departure
that...
that
the
board
reinstates
at
the
conclusion
of
the
appeal.
so
an
alien
in
this
position
who
has
been
granted
voluntary
departure
and
knows
that
a
motion
to
reopen
may
not
be
a
realistic
option,
if
he
wants
to
seek
adjustment
of
status
or
cancellation
of
removal,
the
solution
to
that
is
to
be
alert
and
attentive
and
file
something
with
the
board,
if
there
are
in
fact--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
would
be...
that
would
be
one...
as
the
attorney
general
said
in
his
proposed
regulations,
that
would
be
one
way
to
administer
the
program,
but
the
act
does
not
compel
that.
the
act
does
not
compel--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
the
alien
is
still
subject
to
deportation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
he
could
get...
he
could
get
a
stay
of
removal,
and
the
same...
same
thing
is
true
here,
if
the...
if
the
alien
remains
in
the
country,
his
voluntary
departure
period
expires,
he
could
file
for
a
stay
of
removal
with
the
board
or
he
could
file
for
a
stay
of
removal
with
the
court
of
appeals
if
he
wants
to
file
a
petition.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
but...
but
like
any
person,
he
could
file
a
motion
for
a
stay
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
prevent
his
deportation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that...
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
as
i
say,
the
way
that...
the
board's
order
grants
him
permission
to
voluntary
depart
and
says
the
following
consequences
will
attach
if
you
do
not.
nothing
in
the
board's
order
allows
him
to
withdraw.
it
grants
him
that
permission.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
it
probably
forecloses
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
it's
the...
it's
the
content
of
the
board's
order
that...
that
says
you
have
60
days
to
depart
and
if
you
do
not,
the
following
consequences
attach.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
i...
the
statute
and
regulations
just
don't
provide
for
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he...
he
requested
it
at
the
outset.
the
case
has
proceeded
on
the
sense
that
that
is...
that
that
is
the
arrangement,
that...
that
the
reciprocal
benefits
and
burdens
that
the
government
and
the
alien
have
undertaken--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
i'm
not
standing
here
defending
the
contrary
position
as
an
overarching
policy
matter,
because
after
all
the
attorney
general's
proposed
regulations
provide
for
that.
my--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
they
are
now
drafted
they
would
apply
prospectively.
but
my
only
point
is
that
voluntary
departure
and
motions
to
reopen
are
administered
under
the
statute
and
the
regulations
and
the
bia
orders
that
are
entered
under
the
current
regulatory
framework,
which
has
a
different
sort
of
deal
between
the
alien
and
the
government
in
mind,
and
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
essentially...
i
think
essentially
yes.
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
and
i
want
to
qualify
my
answer
in
a
further
respect...
that
regulations
with
respect
to
voluntary
departure
being
granted
by
the
board
don't
say
anything
like
that.
but
i
am
informed
by
the
executive
office
of
immigration
review
that
if
the
immigration
judge
grants
voluntary
departure
and
the
alien
appeals
to
the
board,
the
ordinary
course
would
be
for
the
board
to
reinstate
voluntary
departure
if
it
rejects
the
alien's
appeal.
but
if
on
appeal
the
alien
requests
that
voluntary
departure
not
be
reinstated
once
the
board's
order
is
entered,
then
the
board
will
omit
that
from
its
final
order
of
removal.
but
petitioner
here
did
not
request
on
his
appeal
to
the
board
that
the
board
not
reinstate
a...
order
a
voluntary
departure
if
it
had
affirmed
on
the
merits.
and
so
the
board
went
forward
on
the
assumption
that
the
alien
had
requested
voluntary
departure,
entered
an
order
on
that
assumption,
and
once
it's
entered,
it's
a
final
order
that
would
require
some
amendment
of
the
order,
in
order
to...
in
order
to
be
changed
under
the
current
regime.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
didn't.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think...
i
think
if
the
court
wants
to
get
into
the
question
of
whether
he
could
withdraw
it,
the
proper
thing
for
the
court
to
do
would
be
to
reject
the
petitioner's
argument
that
there
is
an
automatic
tolling
rule,
because
that's
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
congress'
deliberate
intention
to
impose
a
short
deadline
and
not
let
the
agency
extend
that,
but
to
remand
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
for
an
explanation
as
to
whether
he
could
withdraw
his
request
for
voluntary
departure.
i
don't
think
the
court
should
decide
that
question
on
its
own.
i
think
that
should
be
remanded
to
the
board.
if
in
the
meantime
the
attorney
general
issues
regulations
that
provide
for
withdrawal
of
the
request,
maybe
because
his
case
would
be
back
before
the
board,
those
new
regulations
could
be
applied.
but
whether
that...
the
alien
should
be
allowed
to
do
that
is
fundamentally
a
question
for
the
attorney
general
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
it
was
elected
before
the
immigration
judge.
that's
where
you
request
it.
if
the
immigration
judge
rejects
your
arguments
against
removability,
grants
you
voluntary
departure--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--you
can.
and
you
can
get
120
days
of
time
to
depart.
you
can
do
that.
people
who
don't
want
to
contest
the
removability
at
all--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
in
the
contested
cases,
you
would
ask
for
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
before
the
immigration
judge.
that
gets
suspended
if
you
appeal
to
the
bia
because
the
order
is
not
final.
it
doesn't
become
final
until
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
affirms.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
do
not.
i
asked
that
question,
and
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
the
fundamental
automatic
tolling
rule
that...
the
fundamental
inconsistency
of
that
automatic
tolling
rule
with
what
congress
did
in
1996,
because
it
shortened
to
60
days
the
time
limit
in
which
an
alien
can
depart.
it
also
eliminated
a
prior
exception
that
had
been
the
law
that
allowed
an
exception
to
the
consequences
for
somebody
who
overstayed
even
the
much
longer
voluntary
departure
period
for
exceptional
circumstances.
congress
repealed
that
exception.
prior
to
1996,
the
board
in
the
case
we
cite
in
our
briefs
called
matter
of
shaar,
held
that
if
an
alien
is
granted
voluntary
departure
and
files
a
motion
to
reopen,
it
rejected
two
arguments.
one
is
that
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
reopen
was
itself
exceptional
circumstances
that
eliminated
the
deadline.
it
rejected
that.
it
also
in
an
en
banc
decision
rejected
the
automatic
tolling
rule
that
petitioner
is
arguing
for
here
under
a
situation
in
which
congress
had
granted
a
long
time
for
aliens
to
voluntarily
depart.
we
think
it
defies
common
sense
to
suggest
that
when
congress
compressed
the
time
to
60
days,
it
meant
to
at
the
same
time
reverse
what
the
board
had
done
in
matter
of
shaar
and
granted
an
automatic
tolling
rule,
not
even
one
under
the
control
of
the
immigration
authorities,
but
an
automatic
tolling
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
simply
by
the
unilateral
act
of
filing
a
motion
to
reopen.
and
the
board
in
matter
of
shaar
addressed
all
of
those
things.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
filed,
followed
matter
of
shaar,
in
the
intervening
years
since
1997...
and
importantly,
i
would
like
to
point
this
out,
too,
when
petitioner
sought
a
motion
for
reopening,
he
relied
on
a
board
decision
called
villarde,
which
recognized
that
in
some
circumstances
an
alien
may
file
a
motion
to
reopen
to
try
to
get
adjustment
of
status
if
there
has
been
intervening
development
with
respect
to
an
immediate
relative
petition
filed
by
a
spouse.
the
board
adopted
that
rule
in
this
en
banc
published
decision
villarde,
but
said
one
of
the
qualifications
for
being
eligible
for
that
relief
is
that
you
not
be
barred
under
matter
of
shaar,
which
means
you
not
be
barred
by
having
overstayed
your
voluntary
departure
period.
so,
in
the
very
procedure
that
petitioner
invoked
in
this
case,
there
is
a
published
board
decision
post-1997
that
relies
on
that...
that
relies
on
that
rationale,
and
the
board
has
followed
that
consistently.
it
is
at
the
very
least
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
act
for
the
attorney
general
not
to
allow
the
undermining
of
this
tightened
voluntary
departure
system
by
providing
for
reopening.
i
should
also
point
out
that
this
is
not
tolling
in
the
normal
sense.
tolling
usually
arises
where
a
person
has
a
claim
and
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
for
filing
a
claim
before
a
forum.
petitioner
here
was
already
granted
voluntary
departure.
the
60-day
time
limit
is
not
a
procedural
statute
of
limitations.
it
is
a
limitation
on
substantive
immigration
relief.
and
we
think
it's
particularly
odd
that
the
filing
of
a
procedural
motion
to
reopen
would
have
the
effect
of
changing
the
statutorily
limited
time
in
which
an
alien
could
voluntarily
depart
the
united
states.
