justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
he's
not
in
the
same
circumstance.
i
mean,
he's
made
his
choice.
he
was
offered
voluntary
departure,
which
had
advantages.
he
could
arrange
his
affairs
and
go
when
he
wanted
within
60
days.
what
he
gave
up
was
the
ability
to
appeal
the
determination.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
as,
as
outrageous.
i
mean,
it
happens
all
the
time.
when
a
criminal
defendant
pleads
to
a
lesser
charge,
he
gives
up
the
ability
to
appeal.
and
that's
what's
going
on
here.
he
has
gotten
the
advantage
of
a
voluntary
departure
and
given
up
the
ability
to
appeal.
i
don't
bleed
for
him.
it
seems
to
me
it's
an
option
presented
before
him
and
he
took
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
still
and
all,
it's
part
of
the
deal.
even
better.
he
hasn't
even
given
up
all
his
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just,
part
of
the
deal
he
gave
up
this
little
ability
to
reopen,
and
that's...
that's
the
choice
he
made
when
he
accepted
voluntary
departure.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
your
discussion
with
justice
breyer
you
seemed
to
be
saying
that
he
can
hang
around
right
through
the
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
by
regulation,
though,
that
he
can't,
he
cannot
pursue
that
from
out
of
the
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i'm
not
following
this.
i
thought
the
assumption
was
we're
going
to
be
using
the
government's
new
proposed
system,
in
which
the
acceptance
of
voluntary
departure
is
eliminated
when
you
file
a
reopening
petition,
right.
so
can
the
government
then
proceed
to
deport
you
involuntarily
or
is
that
also
going
to
be
stayed
until,
until
completion
of
the
reopening
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that,
that
involuntary
deportation
would
effectively
cancel
the,
the
petition
for
reopening,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
are
you
willing
to
leave
the
involuntary
deportees
in
that
position,
whereas
you're
not
willing
to
leave
the
voluntary
deportees
in
that
position,
that
their
reopening
petition
just
vanishes?
why
is
it
any
fairer
for
the
involuntary
deportees
than
for
the
voluntary?
in
fact
it's
probably
fairer
for
the
voluntary
because
they
made
their
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
i
think,
i
think
that
your,
your
opposing
counsel
gave
a
good
answer
to
that.
i
also
thought
it
was
a
quid
pro
quo,
but
it's
a
very
strange
quid
pro
quo.
i
could
understand
the
government
saying,
look,
if
you
accept
voluntary
departure
your
reopening
is
dead;
you
have
to
choose
between
asking
for
reopening
or
voluntary
departure.
but
that's
not
the
quid
pro
quo
you're
saying
that
the
government
is
adopting.
the
quid
pro
quo
is
if
you
accept
voluntary
departure
you
roll
the
dice
as
to
whether
your
reopening
petition
will
be
decided
in
time.
it
isn't
dead.
it's
still
there,
but
you
just
have
to
hope
that
it
will
be
decided
before
you
get
deported.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
you
said
you
can
or
you
can't
from
out
of
the
country?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why,
if
you
want
to
have
a
petition
for
reopening,
why
don't
you
just
file
an
appeal
and
then
file
a
petition
for
reopening
and
the
appeal
will
enable
you
to
stay
in
the
country
until
your...
your
petition
for
reopening
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
appealing
the
immigration
judge's
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
immigration
judge's
decision,
you're
appealing
that
to
the
bia.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that...
that
enables
you
to
stay
in
the
country--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
at
the
same
time
you
file
a
petition
to
reopen
the...
the
administrative
law
judge's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
with
counsel
for
the
government
as
to
how
long
it
typically
takes
for
these
motions
to
reopen
to
be
disposed
of?
he
said
something
like
55
percent
take,
what,
more
than--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
answer
is
yes,
but
the
attorney
general's
rule
would
prevent
that...
proposed
rule
would--
