justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
say
that
tolling
is
automatic,
which
i
assume
is
your
position,
would
it
be
possible
under
the
statutes
to
say
that
tolling
is
not
automatic
but
can
be
permitted
in
the
discretion
of
the
hearing
officer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
are
we
then
just
inventing
something
that's
not
in
the
statute
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
all
it
needs
to
do
is
to
say,
we'll
grant
you
an
extension
while
we
look
at
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
your
client
or
some
other
client,
assuming
the
government
wins
in
this
case,
leaves
within
the
60-day
period
and
the
petition
for
rehearing
is
forwarded,
can
he
take
all
these
affidavits
and
apply
for
an
adjustment
of
status,
or
is
that
much
longer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
with
voluntary
departure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
one
question?
and
i'm
not
sure
the
progression
in
which
justice
breyer
was
going
to
begin.
i
take
it
that
the
motion
to
reopen
has...
shows
new
evidence,
new
factors,
new
circumstances;
and
that
would
be
unavailable
on
the
appeal,
because
the
record
hasn't
been
supplemented.
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
while
you
have
an
appeal...
while
you
have
an
appeal
from
what
was
in
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
don't
have
the
motion
to
reopen
then
the...
then
the
new
material
is
not
subject
to
the
appeal,
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
one
of
your...
in
one
of
your
arguments
earlier
you
said
the
whole
idea
of
voluntary
departure
is
to
expedite
the
proceedings
and
so
forth.
i
assume
that
voluntary
departure
is
never
elected
as
an
option
before
the
board
rules.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
it...
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
the
removal...
at
the
outset,
you
don't
elect
voluntary
departure
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no.
i
mean
in
a
contested
case.
