chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-1181,
dada
v.
mukasey.
mr.
meade.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
many
of
those
are...
are
granted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
percentage
of
motions
to
reopen
are
granted
in
favor
of
the
alien?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
many...
do
you
know
how
many
are
filed
on
an
annual
basis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
would
be
no
reason
not
to
file
one
of
these
if
you
were
subject
to
voluntary...
if
you
elected
voluntary
departure,
and
it
extended
your
time
to
stay,
right?
seemingly,
everybody
would
file
one
of
these
if
we
rule
in
your
favor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
dealing
with
people
who
have
already
broken
the
law.
so
you're
saying
they
are
likely
to
follow
the
statute
that
says
only
file
a
motion
to
reopen
under
these
circumstances?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
another
way
to
reconcile
the
two
that
i
think
would
be
beneficial
to
your
client,
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
open
to
us,
is
to
address
the
government's
view
that,
when
you
voluntarily
depart,
your
motion
to
reopen
is
automatically
withdrawn.
that
is,
as
i
gather,
set
forth
only
in
a
regulation
and
not
the
statute.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were...
if
i
thought
it
important
to
reconcile
the
two,
i
would
be
much
more
concerned
about
that
interpretation...
that
the
motion
to
reopen
is
automatically
withdrawn...
than
i
would
suggest
we
start
incorporating
equitable
tolling
rules
and
all
of
that.
but,
i
take
it,
the
vulnerability
of
that
regulation
is
probably
beyond...
beyond
debate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
don't
address
it
here,
there's
going
to
be
another
case
in
a
year
or
18
months
where
that's
going
to
be
raised?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
all
these
cases,
if
you
think
you
have
a
good
case
on
the
motion
to
reopen,
all
you
have
to
do
is
give
up
the
benefits
that
you
have
availed
yourself
under
voluntary
departure,
and
then
the
motion
to
reopen
is
not
automatically
withdrawn.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
mean
he...
you
should
not
elect
voluntary
departure
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
were
those
circumstances
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
presumably
it
doesn't
take
them
much
time
because
when
someone
elects
voluntary
departure
they
don't
have
to
address
it.
i
mean,
this
would
obviously
increase
the
volume
of
motions
to
reopen.
as
i
said,
i
don't
see
know
why
anybody...
why
everybody
wouldn't
file
one,
because
it
extends
their
stay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
your
position
that
the
right
to
appeal
is
taken
away,
just
as
under
the
current
regime
the
motion
to
reopen
is
taken
away?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
to
argue
that
the...
my
understanding
is
that
once
the...
let's
say
it's
the
government's
proposed
regulation
and
the
motion
for...
or
the
voluntary
departure
is
withdrawn
to
enable
you
to
consider
the
motion
to
reopen.
they
can
proceed
with
deportation
at
that
time,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you...
you
almost
have
to
be
arguing
that
the
motion
to
reopen
tolls
the
time
for
deportation
as
well,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
under
your
position,
i
guess,
is
what
your
position
is
on
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
government
cannot
enter
a
deportation
order
during
a
voluntary
departure
period.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
meade.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
very
strange
statutory
quid
pro
quo,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
do
that,
the
alien
is
still
subject
to
deportation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
know
what
percentage
of
these
motions
to
reopen
are
granted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
meade,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
any
estimate
about
how
many
more
motions
to
reopen
will
have
to
be
considered
if
your
client
prevails
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
don't
understand
that,
because
my...
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
in
every
case
grant
an
effective
extension
of
the
time
which
you
would
have
to
depart
if
you
had
filed
a
motion
to
reopen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
answered
my
question
with
respect
to
the
government's
proposed
regulation.
but
under
your
position
that
would
allow
the
voluntary
departure
option
to
remain
open,
then
anyone
who
exercised
that
option
would
want
to
file
a
motion
to
reopen
because
it
would
extend
their
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
answer
is
yes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
if
it
has
10,000
of
these
a
year,
as
you
told
me
in
your
opening
argument.
i
mean,
it
takes
some
time
to
address
them.
you
can't
say
all
they
have
to
do
is
decide
them
all
within
two
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
06-1181,
dada
versus
mukasey,
which
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
