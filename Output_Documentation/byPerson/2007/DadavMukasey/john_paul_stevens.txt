are
you
asking
for
automatic
tolling
just
until
the
motion
to
reopen
is
decided

until
the
motion
is

also
the
appeal

he

samson
dada,
petitioner
in
this
case
and
a
citizen
of
nigeria,
overstayed
his
temporary
visa.
the
department
of
homeland
security
sought
petitioner's
removal.
as
an
alternative
to
involuntary
removal,
petitioner
requested
voluntary
departure.
this
is
a
form
of
discretionary
relief
that
allows
certain
favored
aliens
to
leave
the
country
willingly.
this
option
gives
the
alien
certain
advantages.
the
immigration
judge
found
petitioner
removable,
but
granted
the
request
for
voluntary
departure.
two
days
before
expiration
of
the
voluntary
departure
period,
petitioner
moved
to
reopen
his
deportation
proceedings.
later,
the
bia
denied
the
motion
to
reopen
because
petitioner
had
overstayed
his
departure
period.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
regarding
whether
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
reopen
automatically
tolls
the
voluntary
departure
period
pending
the
motion's
disposition.
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
today
and
authored
by
justice
kennedy,
we
hold
that
the
automatic
tolling
is
not
available.
tolling
would
fundamentally
alter
the
voluntary
departures
quid
pro
quo
between
the
government
and
the
alien.
it
would
allow
the
alien
to
remain
in
the
united
states,
but
give
the
government
no
benefit
in
return,
but
we
also
cannot
accept
the
government's
argument.
the
government
urges
that
congress
intended
that
the
alien,
an
alien
granted
voluntary
departure
must
relinquish
the
statutory
right
to
seek
--
to
seek
reopening.un
der
the
government's
view
an
alien
granted
voluntary
departure,
but
whose
circumstances
have
changed
in
a
manner
cognizable
on
a
motion
to
reopen,
has
two
unappealing
choices.
one,
he
or
she
can
leave
the
united
states
in
accordance
with
the
voluntary
departure
order,
but
the
motion
to
reopen
will
be
deemed
withdrawn.
two,
if
the
alien
wishes
to
pursue
reopening
and
remains
in
the
united
states
to
do
so,
he
or
she
risks
the
expiration
of
the
statutory
period
and
ineligibility
for
adjustment
of
status,
the
underlying
relief
sought.
this
poor
choice
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
plain
text
of
a
motion
to
reopen
statute.
it
guarantees
to
each
alien
the
right
to
file
"one
motion
to
reopen
proceedings
under
this
section"
and
nothing
in
the
statutes
or
past
use
for
past
usage
with
respect
to
voluntary
departure
indicates
it
cannot
coexist
with
the
motion
to
reopen.
particularly
where
the
plain
text
reveals
no
limitation,
we
must
be
reluctant
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
remove
for
a
protective
class
of
aliens
a
safeguard
as
important
as
the
motion
to
reopen.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
an
alien
granted
voluntary
departure
should
be
permitted
to
unilaterally
withdraw
that
election.
that
request
must
be
made
before
the
departure
period
expires.
this
approach,
while
by
no
means,
the
only
solution
to
the
untenable
conflict
between
the
voluntary
departure
scheme
and
the
motion
to
reopen,
avoids
both
the
quixotic
results
of
the
government's
proposal
and
the
elimination
of
benefits
to
the
government
that
would
follow
from
petitioner's
tolling
rule.
this
petitioner
requested
withdrawal
of
his
motion
for
voluntary
departure
prior
to
expiration
of
the
30-day
departure
period.
the
bia
should
have
granted
this
request.
we
find
this
same
mistake
implicit
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
justice
alito
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
