argument
next
in
case
06-1413,
mead
westvaco
v.
the
illinois
department
of
revenue.
ms.
brinkmann.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
ohio?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
brinkmann,
you
begin
your
brief
by
saying
this,
a
paper
company,
that
happens
to
own
a
data
processing
company.
why
couldn't
you
equally
say
this
is
a
data
processing
company
that
happens
to
own
a
paper
company?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
lexis/nexis
has
been
a
data
processing
company
since
whenever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
the
oldest...
whichever
is
oldest
isn't
the
one
that
gets
to
be
regarded
as
the
dominant
partner,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
general
electric
a
light
bulb
company
or,
since
it
owns
nbc,
a
media
company.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
they
sell
paper
in
illinois?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
lexis
sells
data
services
in
illinois,
too.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
doesn't...
i
mean,
you
just
said,
as
i
understand
it,
illinois
has
the
right
to
tax
lexis
under
business
activities
in
illinois.
illinois
would
argue
the
reason
it
has
a
capital
gain
is
partly
because
they
were
doing
business
in
illinois
and
so
we
should
be
entitled
to
part
of
that
capital
gain.
almost...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
pretty
easy
if
they
get
to
tax
2
percent
of
lexis's
business,
well
then
maybe
they
should
get
2
percent
of
the
capital
gain
when
it's
sold
or
tax
2
percent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
it
kind
of
like
futures
hedging?
i
mean,
you've
got
a
paper
company
and
then
you've
got
something
that
is
sort
of
the
paperless
aspect,
and
they
can
look
at
it
and
say,
well,
we're
kind
of
hedging
our
paper
business
by
investing
heavily
in
something
that's
supposedly
going
to
take
away
the
need
for
paper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
brinkmann,
one
thing
that
concerns
me
is
how
this
will
complicate
the
process.
i
think,
with
respect
to
ordinary
income,
the
states
work
this
out,
and
they
figure
we
get
5
percent
because
we
have
5
percent
of
the
presence
or
business,
whatever.
now,
they're
going
to
have
that,
and
they're
going
to
have
an
overlay
on
that.
they're
going
to
say,
well,
it's
5
percent;
but,
you
know,
we
sold
this
asset
that
doesn't
have
any
connection
to
illinois;
and
that's
part
of
the
income
we've
got.
so
you
don't
get
quite
5
percent
of
all.
and
another...
illinois
is
going
to
come
back
and
say,
well,
yes,
but
you
sold
this
other
one;
and,
as
to
that
one,
you've
got
sufficient
connection
with
illinois.
it
seems
to
me
it's
going
to
be
impossible
to
sort
this
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
barov.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
why
isn't
your
friend
correct
that
you
have
waived
any
argument
based
on
the
presence
of
lexis
in
illinois?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's...
they
are
very
different
from
your
current
argument,
which
you
emphasize
that
whether
they
are
unitary
or
not,
lexis/nexis
was
in
illinois.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
now,
as
to
that
argument,
at
least
i
am
very
reluctant
to
overturn
a
state
court
on
an
argument
that
they
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
consider.
and
whether
it's
technically
waived
because
you
raised
it
in
the
trial
court
or
not,
it
certainly
was
not
an
argument
you
made
to
the
illinois
appellate
courts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
wasn't
in
allied-signal.
in
allied-signal
the
asset
that
was
sold
was
in
new
jersey,
and
that
was
totally
irrelevant
to
how
we
treated
the
issue
in
that
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
why
it's
even
more
dramatic
to
me
that
you
didn't
raise
the
argument
based
on
the
lexis
connection
to
illinois.
that's
the
basis
on
which
your
auditor
is
claiming
these
taxes;
and,
yet,
you
don't
even
raise
it
before
the
illinois
appellate
court
as
a
ground
for
being
able
to
reach
the
lexis/nexis
income.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
couldn't
do
anything
more
if
we
said
you
haven't
waived
it,
we
couldn't
do
anything
more
than
send
it
back.
you're
telling
us
lexis
has
this
presence
in
illinois,
but
we
have
nothing
in
the
record
about
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
just...
usually
appellate
courts
don't
make
findings.
that's
why
i'm
curious--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
thought...
i've
been
looking,
too.
i
thought
18a
does
say
that
they
had
$46
million
of
sales
attributable
to
lexis/nexis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
only
46
million.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
said
46,
not
hundreds
of
millions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
brinkmann,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
brinkmann,
your
final
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
brinkmann,
on
the
waiver
point...
i'm
looking
at
page
18a...
it
not
only
says
that
lexis/nexis
contributed
$46
million
from
its
presence
in
illinois;
it
begins
the
sentence
by
saying
"as
the
department
notes,
$46
million
of
mead's
income
came
from
lexis/nexis
activities
in
illinois.
"
so
that
doesn't
sound
like
a
waiver
of
that
point
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
initially,
it's
about
the
context
in
which...
what
i
regard
as
an
important
fact...
was
raised,
whether
it
was
raised
in
the
context
of
an
argument
on
unitary
business
or
whether
or
not
they
went
too
far,
but
the
stubborn
fact
is
still
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
remarkably
enough,
we
have
two
tax
opinions
to
announce
today.
the
first
is
by
justice
alito.
