mr.
brian
f.
barov
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
illinois
is
not
attempting
to
tax
income
earned
outside
its
borders.
to
the
contrary,
the
income
it
seeks
to
tax
here
is
income
earned
by
mead
on
its
electronic
publishing
business,
lexis,
which
conducted
substantial
business
in
illinois.
mead
paid
taxes
on
the
income
that
the
electronic
publishing
business
earned.
yet,
it
now
contends
that
the
constitution
bars
it
from
taxing
any
of
the
gains
it
realized
on
the
sale
of
lexis,
even
though
illinois
undeniably
contributed--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--no,
your
honor.
it's--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--if
this...
if
they
were
unitary,
yes,
then
lexis's
presence
in
illinois
would
be
irrelevant
to
this
case,
if
they
met
the
unitary
business
doctrine.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
under...
under
those
bare
facts,
probably
there
would
be
not
a
sufficient
connection.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
because,
your
honor--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--there's
a
two
part
answer
to
that
question...
those
questions,
your
honor.
first,
there's
a
second
avenue
of
state
taxation
that's
been
well
recognized
by
this
court
for
at
least
80
years,
which
is
that
if
a
business
conducts
business
in
a
state,
a
state
has
a
tax...
has
the
right
to
tax
a
share
of
that
business.
and
that's
all
illinois
did
here.
when
it
apportioned
the
income
in
this
case,
it
apportioned
the
income
only
based
on
lexis's
in
state
illinois
presence.
so
under
that
avenue
alone,
the
tax
is
constitutional.
the
second--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--right.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
no,
your
honor.
mead
received
the
tax...
the
gain
for
the
sale
because
lexis
was
a
division
of
mead,
and
the
only
tax
paying...
the
only...
there
is
no...
there
was
no
legal
entity
known
as
"lexis"
at
the
time
that
lexis
was
sold.
it
was
assets...
it
was
assets
owned
by
the
mead
corporation.
now,
mead
received
the
benefit...
the
gain
on
the
sale
because
mead
was
the
only
tax
paying
entity
in
this
case.
so
mead
was
conducting
a
business
in
illinois
called
"lexis",
and,
therefore,
illinois
could
tax
at
least--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--yes.
illinois
could
have
taxed
based
on
the--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--but
the...
but
the
point,
your
honor,
is
that
lexis
had
a
presence
in
illinois.
it
was
conducting
business
in
illinois.
that,
alone,
gave
illinois
the
power
to
tax
a
share
of
the
income--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--no.
illinois
can't
tax
that
state
because
there
is
no
relationship...
there
has
to
be
some
relationship,
you
know,
between
illinois
and
the
tax
paying
activity
and
the
taxpayer.
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
there
was
none.
but
there
is
a...
but
let
me,
if
i
can,
address
that
prong
of
the
analysis,
also.
here
there
was
a
much
closer
connection
between
lexis
and
mead
than
simply
that
of
a
passive
investment.
it
wasn't
just
that
mead
helped
lexis
buy,
make,
handle
acquisitions.
they
were
involved
in
the
actual
acquisitions
themselves,
in
purchasing
and
contracting
to
make
those
acquisitions.
mead
was
involved
in
many
of
the...
in
controlling
lots
of
their
capital
investment,
its...
and
its...
it
was
also
involved
in
manipulating
excess...
in
their
excess
cash.
and
there
is
a
whole...
there
was
a
host
of
facts
that
supported
a
closer
relationship
between
mead
and
lexis
than
simply
that,
that
passive
investment.
so
whether...
even
if
you
are
looking
at
it
from
the
operational
function
point
of
view,
there
was...
there
was
a...
a
sufficient
connection
between
lexis
and
mead
beyond
that
of
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
under
our
tax
laws--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--this
would
have
probably,
i
think,
your
honor...
i
believe
this
would
have
been
apportioned
as
business
income
under
illinois
law.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
i
don't
know
what
ohio
did.
they...
mead
has
never
cited
anything
in
the
record
to
support
the
contention
that
it
has
been...
that
it
was
allocated
all
to
ohio.
my
understanding
of
ohio
law
at
the
time
was
they...
they
have
the
same
business
income
test,
basically,
that
illinois
does.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
different
states
have
different
rules,
your
honor,
and
these
are
state-law
rules,
not
constitutional
rules,
about
allocation
and
apportionment.
some
states
will
allocate
an
intangible
capital
gain
like
this
to
their
own
domicile
state.
other
states
will
apportion
it
based
on
the
share
of
income
that
is
done
in
the
state.
again,
i
don't
know
what
ohio
did.
but
the
point
is
that's
a
rule...
that's
a
state-law
rule
of
choice,
not
a
rule
of...
a
constitutional
rule.
i
think
this
court
has
been
pretty
clear
in
the
mobil
oil
case
that
these...
those...
that
doesn't
have
a
constitutional
significance.
that
when
a
state,
a
domicile
state,
and
a
state
where
a
source...
which
is
the
source
of
income,
when
those
conflict,
in
fact,
this
court
has
signaled
that
apportionment
is
the
default
rule.
and
that
the
source
state
actually
would
have...
the
source
state
would
win
that
confrontation.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
yes,
they
would,
your
honor.
but
they
would
be
limited
in
how
much
of
that
capital
gain
they
could
apportion.
they
would
apportion
it
limited
to
the
amount
of
income
that
arose
in
illinois.
and
that's
what
the
auditor
did
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
right,
and
then
that
would
be
put...
that
would
be
put
into--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--yes,
it
would
be.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
your
honor,
two
reasons:
first,
under
the...
they
have
cited
basically
two
basis
grounds
for
waiver,
one
under
illinois
law
and
under
this
court's
rules.
but
they
misstate
illinois
law
in
the...
on
the
waiver
regard.
the
cases
and
rules
they
cite
to
stand
for
a
simple
proposition
that
a
point
not
raised
in
a
brief
before
a
particular
court
can't
be
raised
on
oral
argument.
but
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
been
clear
on
"otherwise"
is
that
an
argument,
even
if
it's
not
raised
in
the
appellate
court,
as
long
as
it's
raised
in
the
trial
court
in
support
of
a
judgment,
may
be
raised
in
a
reviewing
court
on
further
review.
i
can
provide
a
couple
of
cites,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
yes,
your
honor.
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and...
but
i
think,
as
this
court
set
forth
in
caterpillar
v.
lewis,
it
is
a
predicate
to
the
intelligent
resolution
of
this
case.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
certainly,
your
honor.
but
new
jersey
was
taking
a
very
different
position
in
that
case.
they
were
making
a
much
broader
argument
than
we
are
making
here.
they
were
trying
to
overturn
the
entire
unitary
doctrine.
and
so
they
may
have...
they
may
have
chosen
not
to
make
that
argument.
it
may
very
well
have
been
in
that
case
that
asarco's
apportionment
factors
in
that
case
were
so
minimal
that
it
wasn't
worth
their
making
that
argument.
but,
for
whatever
reason,
they
weren't
interested
in
taxing
based
on
the
source
alone.
but
here,
as
the
facts
show,
illinois
did
tax.
we
taxed
lexis,
or
the
gain
on
lexis,
pursuant
to
lexis'
in
state
apportionment
factors.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
it
was
computed...
what
the
department
did
in
this
case
is
it...
it
took
the
entire
gain
that
put...
that
went
into
mead's
apportionable
tax
base.
but,
then,
in
order
to
find
the
illinois-lexis
share
of
the
gain,
he
looked
at
the...
he
looked
at
lexis's
illinois
sales
and
illinois's...
lexis's
illinois
payroll
and
pulled
that
amount
out,
which
was
about
four
percent
of
the
gain,
and
put
that
into
mead's--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--right.
you
use
a
different
formula.
you
use
a
two
factor
formula,
but
it
was
just
related
to
mead's
sales,
not
to--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--no,
your
honor,
it
wasn't.
i
mean
lexis
did
considerable
business
in
illinois,
and
the
auditor
was
isolating
illinois's
business
in
attempting
to
accurately
value
the
amount
of
gain
that
should
be
attributable
to
mead
based
on
lexis's
illinois
presence.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--the
trial
court...
actually
the
appellate
court
ruled
on
whether
the
state
law
tests
had
been
met
at
the
time.
and
when
it
went
up
on
appeal
we...
we
prevailed
in
the
appellate
court
based
on
operational...
i'm
sorry,
in
the
trial
court,
based
on
the
court's
finding
the
operational
function
had
been
met.
that's
how
the
appellant
framed
the
issue,
and
the
case
sort
of
turned
on
really
illinois
state
law's
interpretation
of
allied-signal.
but,
you
know,
at
this
point
the...
the
facts
and
the
law
are
clear
and
a
decision--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--correct,
yes.
yes,
they
did.
at
this
point,
your
honor,
i
mean,
to
render
a
decision
that
doesn't
take
into
account
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
economic
reality,
accordingly
would
be
artificial.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
yes,
it
is
in
the
record.
the
auditor's...
i
mean,
the
stipulation
itself
shows
that
lexis
was
in
illinois.
and
the
illinois
appellate
court
made
a
finding
that
the
presence
of
lexis...
mead
to
tax
nexis
with
illinois
was
undisputed.
so
the
illinois
appellate
court
recognized
that
lexis
had
a
taxing...
adequate
taxing
connection
with
illinois.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
that
is...
i
don't
have
the
page
cite
handy,
your
honor,
but
the
appellate
court
did
make
a
finding
that
it
was
undisputed
that
the--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--i'm
sorry.
made
a
statement.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
there
was,
there
was
a
long
stipulation,
yes,
your
honor,
and
plus
there
was
exhibits
attached
to
the
stipulation,
which
are
reflected
in
our
briefs,
that
discuss
in
detail
what
mead
and
lexis
were
both
doing,
at
least
their
relationship
to
each
other.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
no,
your
honor.
but
in
allied-signal
there
was...
examples
were
given
of
certain--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--i
guess
on
that
point
i
would
disagree
with
you
a
bit,
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
very...
they're
different
types
that
look
at
different
relationships.
so
one
doesn't...
while
the
same
facts
can
support
them
in
instances,
you
can
have
situations
where
a
business
is
unitary
but
not
operational
or...
i'm
sorry,
an
asset
is
operational,
but
isn't
necessarily--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
your
honor,
on
that
point
i
disagree.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
i
think
there
is...
i
mean,
they're
both
ways
of
reaching
the
overall
unitary
principle,
whether
you
can
show
the
intangible
flow
of
assets...
of
value
between
a
company...
i
can
give
you
an
example,
say,
of
a
company
that
would
be
unitary
but
where
the
operational
function
analysis
wouldn't
apply
is
the
container
corp.
type
fact
pattern,
where
you
have
a
domestic...
a
domestic
parent
providing
value
out
to
the
foreign
subsidiaries,
but
there
is
nothing
sort
of
flowing
back
to
the
domestic
parent.
they're
not
really
using
those
subsidiaries
in
the
domestic
business.
but
nevertheless,
there
is
enough
value
being
thrown
out
that
it
passed
the
unitary
threshold.
the
unitary...
the
unitary...
i'm
sorry.
the
operational
function
analysis
or
test
or
principle,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
arises
in
the
examples
given
in
allied-signal.
as
you
said,
you've
got
something
which
isn't
really
part
of
the
rest
of
your
business,
but
you're
using
it
in
that
business
to
support
it
way
beyond
just
a
passive
investment.
and
this...
in
this
case,
that's
how
mead
was
using
lexis.
they
were
using
it
to
support
their,
the
value
of
their
multiple,
their
multi
state
business,
by
manipulating...
by
making
capital
contributions,
manipulating
corporate
structures,
and
bringing
back
that
tax
and
net
loss
carryforwards,
which
increased
the
value,
which
increased
their
business
activities.
so
this
case
actually
is
that...
is
that...
falls
within
that
paradigm
also.
it's
not
unlike
any...
like
either
of
those
hypotheticals
in
allied-signal,
not
unlike
the
use
of
working...
investment
of
working
capital.
so,
yes,
both...
the
test,
while
there
are
facts
that
overlap
them,
they
can
show
that
there
are
different
relationships.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
create
a
separate
doctrine
again.
i
think
these
are
both
considered
different
ways
of
showing
the
intangible
flow
of
value,
the
significant
links
between
a
business
that
give
rise
to
constitutional
apportionment.
and
whether
they're
considered
separate
analyses...
they
have
been
described
by
some
academics
as
corollaries
of
each
other.
it's
certainly,
given
this
court's
signals
in
allied-signal,
i
think
it's
certainly
appropriate
where
the
facts
arise
to
make
the
constitutional
finding
based
on
the
operational
function
that
an
asset
serves
in
a
business.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
i
don't
know,
your...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
i
hope
not.
in
any
event,
your
honor--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--in
any
case,
your
honor,
as
you
said,
as
i've
said,
there
are
two
possible
ways
that...
two
different
constitutional
paths
or
theories
that
we
can
go
down
in
this
case
to
meet
the...
that
allows
illinois
to
apportion.
independent
of
the
operational
links,
mead
can
tax
the
gain
on
lexis
simply
because
lexis
conducted
business
in
illinois.
a
state
may
tax
a
nonresident's
investment
income
based
on
its
investment
in
a
separate
business,
and
that's
exactly
what
illinois...
that's
another
way
to
uphold
the
illinois
appellate
court's
decision.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
that's
possible,
your
honor,
but
it's...
first,
there
is
no...
there's
no
evidence
that
ohio
in
fact
did
that.
but
i
think
the
mobil
oil
case
should
have
disposed
of
that,
that
contention,
because
this
court
rejected
a
similar
argument
that
the
mere
possibility
of
taxation
by
a
domiciliary
state
foreclosed
taxation
by
a
state
where
the
business
was
present.
and
under
mobil
oil,
when
a
resident
state's
claim
and
a
source
state's
claim
conflict,
this
court
indicated
that
the
resident
state's
claim
must
yield
to
that
of
the
source
state.
so
there
should
be
no
issue
of
multiple
taxation
in
this
case.
just...
chief
justice
roberts,
just
to
go
back
to
your
question,
it's
page
11a
of
the
pet.
app.
where
the
appellate
court
said:
"mead
does
not
dispute
that
lexis/nexis
had
the
requisite
connection
or
nexus
with
illinois.
"
mr.
brian
f.
barov
right.
certainly.
there
was
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
sales
in
illinois.
so
that's
really
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
i'm
sorry.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
i'm
sorry.
in
1994,
yes,
that's
correct.
the...
and
again
there's...
both
mead
and
lexis...
as
both
mead
and
lexis
had
adequate
constitutional
connection
here,
there
is
no
basis
not
to
sustain--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
it's--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--well,
it's
relevant
if,
only
if,
this
court
finds
that
there
was
no
operational
relationship
between
lexis
and
mead.
then
lexis's
presence
in
illinois
becomes
relevant
because
in
that
case,
whether
you
look
at
this
as
a
separate
business
conducted
by
mead
or
whether
it
was
even
a
passive
investment
of
mead's,
illinois
can
still
tax
it
in
the
manner
that
it
did
by...
by
isolating
the
values
of
lexis's...
that
lexis
earned
in
illinois.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
that
's
correct.
there
was
no
j.c.
penney,
a
state
can
tax
a
nonresident
on
an
investment
in
that
state
as
well
as
the
tax
is
properly
prorated
to
the
amount
of
income
that
rose
within
that
state.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
one
taxpayer
and
it
was
mead.
that
was
the
only
party
that
could
have
been
taxed.
that's
correct.
so
here,
in
this
case,
mead
is
taking
an
all
or
nothing
approach
to
taxation
but
this
could...
this
disregards
the
connections
between
mead's
electronic
publishing
business
in
illinois.
and
the
court
should
decline
to
rule
in
their
favor.
in
fact--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--you
have
to
establish
a
connection
with
the
taxpayer's
activities
in
the
taxing
state.
that's
the
constitutional
touchstone.
so
if
mead...
whether
mead
was
running
a
business
in
illinois
or
investing
in
illinois
or
had
a
unitary
business
that
operated
in
illinois,
those...
that's
the...
that
provides
a
sufficient
link.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
so
that
provides
the
taxing...
the
ability--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--no,
your
honor.
under
international
harvester,
i
think
that
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
even
a
passive
investment
can
be
taxed
by
a
state.
if
mead...
mead
can
be
taxed...
even
if
lexis
was
a
passive
investor
and
mead
was
only
investing
in
illinois,
illinois
could
still
tax
mead
on
the
value
of
its
investment
that
arose
in
illinois.
and
so
mead
realized
the
gain.
mead
is
the
taxpayer.
mead
can
be
taxed
as
long
as
the
tax
is
properly
prorated
to
the
illinois
presence,
which
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
exactly.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
well,
no,
your
honor.
it's...
under
this...
then
under
this
court's
precedent,
that
you're
looking
for
the
source
state,
the
activity
of
the
business
was
conducted
in
the
source
state.
now,
in
this
case
it
happened
that
the
amounts
are
fairly
close
to
each
other.
so
if
there
is
any
question
about
it,
there's
no...
you
know,
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
that
arises
out
of
that.
but
clearly
this...
i
mean
it's
settled
precedent
that
a
state
can
tax
based
on
income...
the
income
that
arose
in
that
state
and
that's
what
happened
here.
indeed,
to
accept
mead's
contention
which
also
would
create
a
constitutional
loophole
that
for
income
in
ae
state's
marketplace
helped
create
but
which
a
state
cannot
recover,
the
illinois
court's
decision
permitting
illinois
to
tax
a
fraction
of
the
gain
should
be
affirmed.
and
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--in
the
abstract,
yes,
you
could,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
f.
barov
no,
your
honor,
but
again,
your
honor--
mr.
brian
f.
barov
--your
honor,
this
is...
but
your
honor,
international
harvester
is
the
perfectly
precise
fact
pattern
where
this
court
upheld
a
tax
on
a...
on
investors,
on
the
shareholder's
investment
in
a
state
in
which
they
were
not
present,
so...
but
in
this
case
mead
had
an
independent
tax
presence
also
in
illinois.
so
that
issue
just
doesn't
arise
in
this
case.
