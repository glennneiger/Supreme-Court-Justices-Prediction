justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
thinking
about
that
part
correctly?
i...
i
found
this
difficult.
i
go
back
to
the
railroad;
that
seems
the
easiest
case.
you
have
a
railroad
in
50
states,
and
illinois
finds
it
very
hard
to
evaluate
its...
evaluate
its
value,
its
railroad
property
in
illinois,
because
the
value
of
that
depends
on
service
everywhere.
so
the
court
says
that's
the
unitary
principle;
and
really
what
you're
supposed
to
look
at
is
whether
when
you
look
at
the
supposedly
separate
part
of
the
business,
does
that
separate
part
of
the
business
contribute
to
the
whole
thing?
so
that
if
you
were
in
fact
trying
to
say
what
is
illinois
doing
without
considering
that
separate
part,
it
would
be
tough
to
do.
i
mean,
that's
the
underlying
theme.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that's
so,
there
is
no
second
test.
i
mean,
i
grant
you
there
is
language,
but
really
what
people
have
done
is
they've
said,
we
are
here
in
a
special
situation
because
we
have
an
interest
in
another
company,
and
that's
a
special
part
of
our
business,
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
rest
of
the
business.
and
then
the
argument
is
no,
it
does
have
something
to
do
with
the
rest
of
the
business.
and
if
it
does,
like
it
provides
you
with
working
capital,
it's
just
like
the
railroad
track
in
california
vis
a
vis
illinois.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
doesn't,
it
doesn't.
so
now,
if
that's
right,
then
it's
the
form
of
analysis
rather
than
the
result
that's
wrong
in
the
court
below.
because
they
start
talking
about
two
separate
tests
and
then
people
argue
whether
the
second
should
swallow
up
the
first,
and
at
that
point
i
get
totally
lost.
it's
fairly
long,
but
i'd
appreciate
your
evaluating
what
i've
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
the
question.
i
thought
that
the...
i
agree
with
the
same
question
justice
kennedy
had.
suppose
that
i'm
a
massachusetts
company
that
sells
tables,
and
i
sell
some
tables
in
illinois.
and
one
day
i
take
some
of
the
money,
and
i
buy
an
iron
mine
in
new
mexico.
and
then
i
sell
the
iron
mine.
and
illinois,
not
massachusetts,
wants
to
impose
a
tax.
and
suppose
there
is
no
connection
whatsoever
between
the
iron
mine
and
anything
else
but
for
four,
which
are
the
four
listed
on
page
13a:
one,
that
i
have
contributed
capital
support
to
the
iron
mine.
two,
i
approve
the
major
capital
expenditures
of
the
iron
mine,
sitting
in
my
office
in
massachusetts.
three,
sometimes...
and
this
is
a
tougher
one...
i
call
the
iron
mine
a
division
of
my
table
company.
and,
four,
i
sometimes
retain
tax
benefits
and
control
over
the
extra
cash
of
the
iron
mine,
but
i'm
not
using
it
in
my
day
to
day
work.
now,
are
those
four
things
alone
sufficient
for
illinois
to
tax
the
sale
of
my
iron
mine?
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
way
they
presented
it.
maybe
it
is
a
unitary
business
really,
but
i
guess
we
have
to
send
it
back
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
this
case?
that's
what
they
said
it
was.
that's
what
they
said,
perhaps
wrongly,
that
this
isn't
a
unitary
business.
and,
therefore,
we
are
left
with
those
four
facts,
and
why
not
send
it
back
and
say
you
haven't
reached
the
unitary
business
question;
go
reach
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
what
could
it
be?
that
is...
as
i
read
this,
i
thought,
well,
there
is
no
separate
test.
it's
just
there's
a
certain
situation
that
comes
up
fairly
commonly
where
someone
claims
that
an
asset
of
a
company
was
really
quite
separate,
and
therefore
when
they
get
income
from
it
or
they
sell
it
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
business.
and
the
answer
is:
it
did
have
something
to
do
with
your
business,
you
used
the
working
capital
and
so
forth,
in
which
case
it's
part
of
the
business.
so
how...
how
is
it...
how
is
it
different
from
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
agree
with
that,
do
you
really
agree,
because
if
you
agree
with
that
there's
no
such
separate
test,
this
court
was
wrong
to
consider
it
separately,
the
lower
court,
and
they
should
have
reached
the
question
they
didn't
reach,
which
was
is
this
whole
thing
one
single
business,
which
is
normally
called
the
unitary
business
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
all
right.
