ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ruling
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
in
this
case
radically
expanded
the
court's
operational
function
test.
the
state
tax
at
issue
violates
the
principles
of
constitutional
limitations
on
state
taxing
authority
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first,
the
factors
relied
on
by
the
appellate
court
here
for
functional...
for
operational
function
would
mean
that
ownership
and
investment
would
meet
that
standard.
but
that's
what
this
court
rejected
in
allied-signal.
a
state
does
not
have
the
authority
to
reach
out
to
tax
all
investments
owned
by
a
company
that
does
business
in
the
state.
the
operational
function
demands
more.
it
applies--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
it's
a
division
does
not
mean
that
it
meets
either
the
operational
function
test
or
the
unitary
business
test.
a
long
line
of
cases
from
this
court
tell
us
that.
it--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
but
the
exxon
case
involved
divisions,
and
it
went
in
favor
of
the
state
taxing
authority.
but
the
court
applied
a
straightforward,
unitary
business
analysis
to
that.
and,
your
honor,
this
dates
back
to
the
adams
express
case
of
1897.
the
court
in
that
case
said
it's
not
ownership.
it's
about
the
use,
the
unitariness
of
use,
not
of
ownership.
mobile
followed
on
that.
mobile
talked
about
the
fact
that
it's
not
the
corporate
form
that
matters.
it
pointed
out
that
that
could
have
little
to
do
with
the
underlying
determination
of
apportionment,
which
depends
upon
whether
it's
a
discrete
business
enterprise.
and
then
following
on
the
heels
of
that
analysis
in
mobil,
the
court
applied
it
to
the
exxon
case
that
involved
divisions.
that
was
a
vertically
integrated
corporation.
it's
very
different
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
it
reached
a
different
result.
moreover,
the
woolworth
case
involved
subsidiaries.
three
out
of
the
four
of
them
were
100
percent
wholly
owned.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
if
it
was
a
capital
gain,
your
honor,
on
the
sale
of
investment,
the
court's
longstanding
cases
teach
that
it
is
the
domicile
that
taxes
that
commercial
gain.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
if
there
was...
the
domiciliary
state
generally
is
the
state
which
has
the
authority
to
tax
an
income
on
a
capital
gain--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
what
the
court
explained
in
mobil,
for
example,
if
it
is
under
the
unitary
business
principle,
then
the
state
in
which--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--if
the...
there
was
sufficient
nexus
to
the
company
doing
business--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
they
would
be
able
to
tax
the
ongoing
business
activity
in
that
state.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
sale
of
the
business
would
be
to
the
domicile
of
the
seller.
they
would
be
able
to--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
unless,
as
the
court
recognized
in
mobil,
there
is
this
unitary
business
exception,
because
the
state's
ability
to
tax
begins
at
the
starting
point
at
the
territorial
limitations
of
the
state.
and
the
court
has--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
the
area--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
but
it
does
come
back
to
the
taxing,
the
right
of
the
domicile
state
to
tax
on
a
sale--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
right,
your
honor,
unless--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--ohio
would
allocate
the
entire
gain
as
a
capital
gain
on
an
intangible
that
was
sold
in
the
state
of
ohio.
that
would
be
allocated
in
its
entirety
to
illinois.
now,
what
the
court
has
recognized
is
that
default
principle
sometimes
gives
way
when
that
gain
has
had
enough
connection
to
business
activity
in
another
jurisdiction.
that's
where
these
issues
arise,
because
there
are
states
taxing
multi
state
activities.
and
that's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--not
if
ohio
had
the
constitutional
right
to
allocate
that
tax
to
ohio,
as
it
does.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
it
allocates
it
to
the
state
of
ohio.
the
only
exception
for
that
would
be
in
a
situation,
not
the
facts
here,
but
if
that
capital
gain
either
served
an
operational
function
to
the
business
activities
that
were
conducted
in
another
state,
then
that
state
would
have
a
right
to
apportion
it
and
tax
its
portion
of
that
or
if
the
operational
function
applied.
and
that
is
because
the
activity
now
has
transformed
from
just
a
capital
gain
that's
connected
to
the
domiciliary
state
of
the
seller
to
a
business
income
because
it
is
part
of
this
unitary
business.
that's
why
the
other
state
has
a
right
to
apportion.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
not
the
situation
here.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
under
ohio's
laws
this
would
be
allocated
to
that
state.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
because
it's
a
capital
gain
on
a
sale
of
an
investment.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
this
has
been
a
paper
company
since
1846.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
under
the
court's
unitary--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no.
but
when
you
do
the
analysis,
you're
looking
at
the
taxpayer,
which
is
mead
corporation.
and
it
clearly
has
a--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
would
have
to
know
many
more
facts
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
but
i...
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
evasive--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
an
analytical
construct
that
we're
doing
here.
we're
looking
at
the
taxpayer
who
is
being
taxed,
the
mead
corporation.
so
you
look
at
its
business
that's
being
conducted
in
illinois.
they
have
a
unitary
paper
company
that's
vertically
integrated
that's
doing
business
activities
in
illinois.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
but
when
you're
looking...
and
for
both
purposes,
your
honor,
for
state
tax
on
the
operating
income
of
both
of
those
businesses,
illinois
does
have
a
right
to
apportion
those
taxes.
and
those
taxes
were
paid
without
objection
by
both
of
those
businesses.
we're
talking
about
a
tax
on
a
different
event,
on
a
capital
gain
on
a
sale
of
the
business
in
ohio.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
that
is
a
belated
argument
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
raised
in
this
court.
it
did
not
present
an
argument
to
the
illinois
appellate
court
based
on
lexis/nexis's
connection
to
illinois.
it
raises
a
host
of
jurisdictional,
procedural
and
substantive
bars.
under
the
rules
of
illinois,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
that
argument
is
waived.
this
comes
to
the
court
from
a
state
court,
not
a
federal
court
of
appeals.
because
of
that
waiver,
it's
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground.
moreover,
that
argument
wasn't
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
either.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
that
would
certainly
be
a
matter
for
the
illinois
court
rather
than
for
this
court,
your
honor.
but
in
addition,
i
think
any
disposition
on
the
merits
of
that
issue
would
be
a
ruling
by
this
court
that
would
be
trumping
that
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
waiver.
moreover,
this
argument
wasn't
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
either.
and
the
court's
precedent,
of
course,
and
practice
would
not
be
to
address
that.
particularly
in
this
case,
it
denied
notice
to
the
amici
who
would
be
affected
by
this
argument.
but
turning
to
the
substance
of
it--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
i
apologize
if
i
misspoke.
ohio
would
allocate,
i
mean,
take
the
entire
gain
for
itself
as
the
domicile
state
of
the
seller--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--of
the
investment.
in
other
factual
scenarios,
if
it
turns
out
that
that
asset
actually
was
not
an
investment
and
in
fact
had
enough
connection
to
the
business
activities
in
illinois
because
it
was
really
the
supplier
of
the
raw
materials,
or
the
two
examples
that
this
court
has
given
as
operational
functions
is
the
interest
on
the
bank
account,
which
is
the
working
capital,
or
the...
the
futures
hedging
against
the
raw
material
of
corn.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
under
the
operational
function
test,
it
has
to
be
a
much
closer
nexus
to
the
operating,
the
operations
of
the
paper
company;
and
short
of
that
operational
function...
or
if
it
were
part
of
the
unitary
business,
the
domiciliary
state
would
allocate.
and
if
i
could
turn--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
that's
contrary
to
the
court's
long
standing
recognition
that
something
that
enriches
the
taxpayer
is
not
necessarily
part
of
the
unitary
business's
operational
function.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
that
isn't
the
operational
connection
that
justifies
a
state--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
i
think
not,
if
we
look
at
allied-signal,
we
look
at
woolworth,
and
we
look
at
asarco.
allied-signal
was
a
sales
and
investment...
and
getting
back
to
the
point
about
the
argument
really
was
waived
about
the
connection
with
lexis/nexis
in
illinois,
those
were
the
same
facts
in
allied-signal.
the
investment
there
was--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
in
allied-signal,
the
investment
there
was
also
doing
business
within
the
state.
in
the
exxon
case,
there
were
divisions
to
which
this
court
applied
the
entire
unitary
business
principle,
because
what
the
court
has
said
repeatedly
in
mobil,
in
exxon,
in
all
these
cases,
it's
not
the
corporate
form;
it
is
whether
there
is
a
discrete
business
enterprise;
and
asarco
speaks
to
this.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct.
we
have
four
or
five
cases
here.
one
of
them
does
involve
divisions,
exxon,
but
in
that
case
it
was
a
vertically
integrated
corporation,
and
the
state
prevailed
in
that
case,
but
it
did
not
change
the
analysis
that
applied.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
has,
your
honor.
it
goes
back
to
principles
that
ownership
do...
does
not
determine;
simply
because
there
is
a
business
operating
in
the
state,
the
state
does
not
have
the
right
to
tax
every
investment
that's
owned
by
that.
that
dates
back
to
1897.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
the
operating
income
within
the
state's
apportioned.
but
if
you
look
to
the
business
activity
of
the
taxpayer
mead,
operating
in
illinois,
it
is
that
nexus
on
which
illinois
is
claiming
that
they
have
a
right
to
tax
here.
and
if
we
look
at
the
woolworth
case,
for
example,
i
think
that
is
also
instructive.
those
were
four
subsidiaries.
three
of
them
were
100
percent
wholly
owned,
and
the
court
expressly
said
we
recognize
they
are
wholly
owned
subsidiaries.
these
could
be
integrated
divisions,
and
they
said,
that
is
not
significant,
if
they
are
independent,
different
business
enterprises.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
no,
in
fact
there
were
also
some
foreign
subsidiaries,
i
believe,
involved
in
the
asarco
case,
for
example,
your
honor,
and
the
same
analysis
applied...
you
know,
whether
it
was
vertically
integrated
and
whether
or
not
it
met...
the
unitary
business
test
goes
back
to
three
core
principles,
and
this
court
has
said
at
least
four
if
not
five
times
that
the
unitary
business
principle
is
the
linchpin
of
apportionment.
that
is
whether
or
not
there
is
functional
integration.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
is
no
virtual
integration;
there
is
no
sharing
of
centralized
management;
there's
no
economies
of
scale.
we
think
this
is
unassailable
in
the
stipular
record--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
would--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
contributing
to
the
business.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
there...
on
this
record,
there's
no
question
that
the
lexis/nexis
cannot
meet
the
unitary
business
test.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
our
position
is
on
the
record
here,
your
honor,
the
stipulated
record,
that
it's
unassailable.
but
we
do--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--and
then
that's
our
position,
obviously,
on
the
record,
your
honor;
but
we
agreed
this
was
properly
raised
in
the
appellate
court,
as
opposed
to
the
other
argument
which
was
not.
and
this
also
was
mentioned
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
as
opposed
to
their
other
argument,
which
was
not.
so
we
do
think
the
court
could
reach
this
argument,
and
we
maintain
that
on
this
record
the
linchpin
of
apportionment
giving
the
right
of
a
state...
and
this
is
a
right
to
extend
beyond
its
territory.
the
court
has
already
let
it
go
beyond
its
territory
to
get
to
something
outside
the
state
if
it's
part
of
the
unitary
business...
the
railroad
case,
the
express
case.
and
in
that
situation
there
are
three
factors,
none
of
which
can
be
met
on
this
record.
there
was
no
shared,
centralized
management,
none.
there
was
no
integrated
functions,
none.
and
there
were
no
economies
of
scale.
lexis/nexis
did
not
even
get
a
discount
on
any
paper
they
bought
from
mead.
they
were,
you
know,
minor
customers
of
each
other.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no.
it
will
continue
to
get
income
tax
on
an
apportioned
basis
before
and
after.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
lexis/nexis
continues
to
operate.
it's
now
owned
by
reed
elsevier.
so
it
would
continue
to
pay
an
apportioned
income
tax.
it's
a
different
event
here,
your
honor.
it
is
the
sale
of
an
investment
that
occurred
in
ohio.
and
as
the
domicile
state,
ohio
has
provided
benefits
to
the
corporate
headquarters,
to
management--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
not
the
commercial
domicile,
your
honor.
there
is
a
distinction
in
all
of
these
cases
between
the
state
of
incorporation
and
the
commercial
domicile.
the
commercial
domicile--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
this
has
been
going
on
since
at
least
1992
in
the
allied-signal
case.
the
lower
courts,
the
state
courts,
except
for
the
court
in
this
case,
have
been
able
to
apply
that
easily.
in
order
to
take
the
expansive
view
of
illinois
here,
you
would
be
undermining
allied-signal,
which
had
the
same
facts
as
in
this
case,
not
to
mention
asarco,
woolworth.
and
i
would
just
say,
before
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
allied-signal
was
the
case
in
which
this
court
was
faced
with
new
arguments
raised
by
the
states,
at
argument.
you
went
back
and
had
resupplemental
briefing
and
reargument,
and
questioned
in
your
questions
to
those
parties
whether
or
not
asarco
and
woolworth
should
be
revisited
and
overruled.
so
the
allied-signal
case
took
into
account
all
of
these
concerns
and
came
back
with
a
ringing
affirmation
of
the
linchpin
of
an
apportionability
for
state
taxation
being
the
unitary
business
test
with
the
operational
function
aspect.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
think
that
the
finding
is
that
it
is
not
unitary.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
if
it
were
unitary,
but
we
think
there's
no
way
this
record
could
meet
the
standards
compared
to
woolworth,
asarco.
in
all
those
cases,
they
were
much
closer.
thank
you.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
have
four
very
quick
points,
your
honor.
two
go
into
this
new,
very
breathtaking
argument
that
the
state
is
making
based
on
lexis/nexis's
presence
to
the
state.
concerning
illinois
law,
if
you
look
repondents'
brief
in
opposition,
on
page
12
at
note
4,
they
cite
the
same
illinois
law
we
do,
trying
to
argue
that
we
had
waived
arguments
in
the
brief
in
op,
so
we
are
on
pretty
solid
ground
there.
i
think
it's
their
cert
page,
they
were
agreeing
with
us
on
what
the
illinois
law
meant.
on
the
substance
of
it,
i
think
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
brought
out
the
weaknesses.
their
position
would
lead
to
taxes
on
all
stock
sales.
any
state
where
an
investment
was
doing
business
could
then
reach
out
and
apportion
the
gain
on
that.
and
as
far
as
international
harvester
and
j.c.
penney,
those
were
tax
on
the
investment,
not
the
investor.
and
the
dissent...
that
was
the
dispute...
the
majority.
it
was
the
incident
of
the
tax
fell
on
the
invest...
the
investment
that
was
doing
business
in
the
state.
the
state
concedes,
your
honor,
on
justice
ginsburg's,
the
distinction
between...
the
sale
of
assets
and
the
sale
of
stocks
that
you
were
concerned
about.
on
page
43,
they
concede
and
i
think
it's
very
well
recognized
through
mobil
and
exxon
and
woolworth
that
"apportionment
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
form
a
business
organization
takes.
"
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
finally
i
would
point
out,
on
the
question
you
asked...
i
think
it
was
justice
ginsburg...
what
illinois
would
do
in
this.
interestingly--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
record
in
this
case
at...
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
it's
at
c-851.
it's
exhibit
1,
to
the
stipulation
of
facts.
it
indicates
that
interest
and
dividends
allocable
are
allocable
to
illinois
if
the
commercial
domicile
is
in
illinois.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
this
is
the
illinois
return,
and
the
question
was
what
illinois
would
do?
and
they
say
commercial
domicile,
we
get
your
interest
and
dividends.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
at
one
point,
after
they
got
through
the
unitary
business
and
operational
functional
analysis,
there
was
an
argument
about
whether
it
was
grossly
disproportionate,
and
that's
where
some
of
that
information
came.
it
was
never
in
the
context
of
this
legal--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--there
are
facts,
your
honor,
but
the
illinois
law
is
very
clear;
it's
rule
341(h)(7)
and
(i)
which
applies
to
applee.
if
you
don't
raise
a
point
in
the
appellate
court,
it
is
waived.
that's
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground.
and
it's
a
very
breathtaking
argument,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
that
also
wasn't
brought
forth
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
thank
you,
your
honor.
