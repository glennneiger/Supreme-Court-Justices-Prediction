how
can
you
call
it
a
passive
investment,
not
only
when
there
was...
i
think
undisputedly...
as...
as
much
interest
and
activity
in
nexis's
business
planning
by
the
mead
people?
but
to
my
mind
even
more
importantly,
when
in
fact
mead,
i
think
a
couple
of
times,
merged
with...
with
nexis...
with
lexis...
when
that
provided
a
tax
advantage,
by...
by
giving
them
loss
carryforwards
that
reduced
their
taxes.
why
isn't
it
fair
to...
to
say
under
the
operational
function
test
that
if...
if
the
company
is...
if
nexis
is...
is
mergeable
with
mead
when
it
produces
a
tax
advantage
and
is
certainly
in
a
very
operational
sense
functional
then,
because
it's
saving
them
a
lot
of
money...
and
that's,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
passive
investment.
if
it's
usable
in
a
merger
scenario
there,
it
ought
when
the...
when
the
tide
turns
be...
be
regarded
as
close
enough
in
operational
function
to
be
taxable
when
the
gain
comes
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
right.
but
weren't
the
enrichment
cases
in
which
income
was
being
generated
by
an
investment?
the
investor,
of
course,
was
the...
was
the
taxpayer
company,
and
it
simply
reaped
the
benefits
of
a
profitable
investment.
that's
something
very
different
from
merging
corporations,
then
unmerging
them,
and
then
merging
them
again
to
provide
not
merely
enrichment,
but
great
tax
savings;
and
if
they
are
operationally
close
enough
to
produce
great
tax
savings,
why
shouldn't
they
be
treated
as
operationally
close
enough
when
in
fact
they...
they
produce
a
capital
gain?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
gain
alone
certainly
is
not.
if
they
had
absolutely
done
nothing
but
make
their
investment
and
wait
to
see
whether
the
ship
came
in,
i
would
understand
your
argument.
but
between
the
investment
and
the
return
of
the
ship,
they
were
merging
these
corporations
back
and
forth
for...
for
their...
for
mead's
tax
advantage.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
take
it
out...
take
the
facts
of
this
case
out
of
the
sort
of
the
paradigm
of
the...
the
operational
or
the
nonoperational
function
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
we
start...
i
don't
mean
to
cut
off
your
argument,
but
don't
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
this
is
not
a
unitary
business?
wasn't
that
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
which
was
not
disturbed
on
appeal?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can
say
it
if
you
want,
but
i
wanted
to
make
sure--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
barov,
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
an
earlier
answer
to
see
how
far
you
would
go
with
the
position
that
you
took.
assume
that,
exclusive
of
nexis,
mead
is
the
same
kind
of
unitary
corporation
as
under...
under
everybody's
understanding
now.
assume,
also,
as
you
suggested
in
a
hypo,
that
lexis
was
doing
business
in
illinois.
so
that
at
least
a...
a
portion
of
its
own
activity
could
be
taxed
in
illinois.
and
assume,
third,
that
the
relationship
between
mead
and
lexis
is
simply
one
of
passive
investment.
mead
simply
bought
a
lot
of
stock,
maybe
100
percent
of
the
stock
at
the
right
time;
and,
otherwise,
it
kept
hands
off.
and
at
this
point
mead
now...
now
sells.
on...
on
your
theory,
would...
would
the
state
of
illinois
be
able
to
tax
a
portion
of
the
capital
gain?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that
would
be,
in
effect,
the
portion
of
the
nexis
business,
total
business
that
took
place
in
illinois,
total
sales,
total
payroll,
however
you
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
the
only
point
i
wanted
to
be
clear
on
to
understand
your
position
is
that
purely
passive
investment
would
be
enough
to
trigger
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
