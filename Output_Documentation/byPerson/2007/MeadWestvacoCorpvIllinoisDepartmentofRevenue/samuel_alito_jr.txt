this
is
meadwestvaco
corporation
versus
illinois
department
of
revenue.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
appellate
court
of
illinois.
the
petitioner
is
a
successor
in
interest
to
the
mead
corporation,
an
ohio
corporation,
engaged
in
the
production
and
sale
of
paper
goods.
the
respondent
is
the
illinois
department
of
revenue.
we
have
been
asked
to
decide
whether
a
tax
levied
by
illinois
on
an
apportioned
share
of
the
capital
gain
that
mead
realized
in
1994,
violates
the
commerce
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
united
states
constitution.
in
1994,
mead
realized
the
capital
gain
on
the
sale
of
one
of
its
divisions,
the
online
research
service
lexis/nexis.
the
state
of
illinois
took
the
position
that
an
apportioned
share
of
this
gain
was
taxable
in
illinois.
mead
paid
the
tax
under
protest
and
filed
this
suit
in
state
court.
the
trial
court
found
that
lexis/nexis
was
not
part
of
the
unitary
business
that
mead
conducted
in
illinois,
but
that
the
state
could
nevertheless
tax
an
apportioned
share
of
the
gain
because
lexis/nexis
serves
an
operational
function
in
that
business.
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
affirmed.
it
agreed
that
lexis
served
an
operational
function
in
meadâ€™s
business
and
did
not
reach
the
question
whether
lexis
and
mead
formed
a
unitary
business.
as
we
explain
at
greater
length
in
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
the
concept
of
operational
function
simply
identifies
one
way
in
which
an
asset
can
form
part
of
the
tax
payer's
unitary
business.
the
operational
function
test,
as
the
state
courts
termed
it,
was
not
intended
to
supplement
the
unitary
business
principle
with
a
separate
ground
for
apportionment.
once
the
court
determines
that
two
businesses
are
not
unitary,
the
constitutional
inquiry
is
generally
at
an
end.
the
trial
court
here
found
that
lexis
and
mead
were
not
unitary,
but
the
appellate
court
of
illinois,
relying
on
its
operational
function
analysis,
made
no
such
determination.
it
is
free
to
consider
that
question
on
remand
and
we
express
no
opinion
on
it
now.
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
is
vacated
and
this
matter
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings,
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
