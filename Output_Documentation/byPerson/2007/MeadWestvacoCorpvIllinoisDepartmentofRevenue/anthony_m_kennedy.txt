no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
the
same--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
this
is
part
of
the
substance.
i
thought
that
as
part
of
one
of
your
answers
you
said
that
ohio
is
free
to
allocate
part
of
this
capital
gains
tax
to
illinois?
did
i
hear
you
say
that,
because
i
don't
understand
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
this
is
a
passive
investment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
like
to
intrude
on
the
white
light,
but
if
i
could
just
ask
one
question.
if
the
unitary
tax
argument
has
been
preserved
and
is
met
and
if
there's
a
finding
that
they
are
unitary,
does
illinois
have
the
right
to
tax
the
sale,
or
to...
to
a
portion
of
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
assume...
assume
it
is
unitary.
can
illinois
then,
in
your
view,
have
a
part
of...
tax
part
of
the
gain
on
the
sale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
did
not
proceed
on
the
unitary
business
there,
let's
take
that
off
the
table.
it
seems
to
me
that
lexis's
presence
in
illinois
is
quite
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that,
under
your
theory,
you
could
tax
the
sale,
even
if
lexis
were
not
in
illinois
at
all,
just
because
mead
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
i
can
just
add
on
to
that
same
question:
if
you're
going
to
have
the
unitary
tax
theory,
that's...
that's
very
helpful.
but
if
we
take
the
unitary
tax
theory
off
the
table,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
confusing
the
law
by
having
some
midway
test.
i
don't
know
what
your
theory
is,
that...
in
relation
to
this
part
of
justice
breyer's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
mead
didn't
receive...
pardon
me...
lexis
didn't
receive
the
money
for
the
sale,
mead
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
unless,
again,
if
mead's
presence
or
nonpresence
is
simply
irrelevant
to
what
happened
here,
absent
a
unitary
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
if
there
had
been
a
separate
corporation
and
that
lexis
was
a
subsidiary
corporation
and
the
subsidiary
was...
it
was
sold,
that,
again,
absent
a
finding
of
unitary,
illinois
then
could
have
had
a
tax?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so,
then,
the
asset
stock
doesn't
make
any
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
gets
back
to
justice
stevens's
initial
hypothetical.
if
you
live
in
new
york
and
you
have
an
investment
in
a
company
that
does
a
lot
of
business
in
illinois
and
you
in
new
york,
a
resident
individual,
sell
that
stock,
under
your
theory
illinois
could
tax
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
those
factors
are
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
fact
of
sale.
it's
just
whimsical.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sale.
the
reason
we
use
apportionment
in
other
cases
is,
just
as
in
justice
breyer's
railroad
example,
there
is
no
other
way
to
tell,
and
so
forth.
but
here
the
presence
of
lexis
in
illinois
is
wholly
accidental
with
reference
to
what
went
on
in
the
sale.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
different--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
proration,
it
seems
to
me...
that
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
extent
of
lexis
in
illinois--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--nor
does
it
have
to
do
with
the
extent
of
mead
in
illinois.
