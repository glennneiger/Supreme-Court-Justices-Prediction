justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
go
back
to
sort
of
a
fundamental
question
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
know
the
answer
to.
supposing
we
don't
have
corporations
here,
but
an
individual
resident
of
new
york
owned
this
whole
business
and
a
big
bunch
of
it
was
activities
in
illinois,
and
he
sold
the
business.
would
illinois
have
the
authority
to
impose
any
tax
on
that
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
it's
not
the
domicile.
the
owner
lives
in
new
york.
the
business
is
all
over
the
country,
but
does
millions
of
dollars
of
business
in
illinois.
and
they
sell
the
whole
business.
would
the
owner
be
subject
to
any
tax
of
any
kind
in
illinois
on
that
transaction?
could
he
constitutionally
be
subjected
to
any
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--assume
it's
not
the
domiciliary
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
we
get
an
answer
without
reference
to
cases?
do
you
think
illinois
would
have
the
authority
to
impose
a
tax
on
that
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
millions
of
dollars
of
business
in
illinois,
that's
my
assumption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
tax
the
sale
of
the
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
only
the
domicile
could
impose
a
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
owned
a
truck
instead
of
a
business,
they
could
tax
that
transaction,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
just...
it
shows
my
ignorance,
but
if
the
unitary
business
approach
to
taxation
was
not
applied
in
this
case,
how
did
you
compute
the
amount
of
the
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
use
a
different
formula
from
the
normal
three
factor
formula
to
compute
the
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
illinois
courts,
they
did
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
the
tax
is
impermissible,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
other
states
have
sought
to
tax
the
capital
gain
on
this
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
far
as
we
know,
illinois
is
out
on
its
own
here?
