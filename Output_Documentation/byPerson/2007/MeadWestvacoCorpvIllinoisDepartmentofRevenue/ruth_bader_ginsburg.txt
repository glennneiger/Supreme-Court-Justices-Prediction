justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
saying
to
me,
ms.
brinkmann...
we
talk
about
an
asset,
an
investment.
this
was
one
company.
this...
it's
strange
to
talk
about
unitary
basis
or
investment.
this
is
a
division
of
one
company.
and
we
are
talking
about
a
sale
of
assets.
not
the
sale
of
stock
of
a
subsidiary.
so
what
more
is
there
than
this
is
one
company,
it
sells
some
of
its
assets?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
any
cases...
do
we
have
any
decisions
that
go
against
the
state
taxing
authority
that
involve
divisions
as
opposed
to
subsidiaries?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is...
what
does
the
domicile
state...
we
have
ohio.
but
you
say
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
not
state
tax
policy,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
the
only
state
that
has
authority
to
tax
the
capital
gain
is
ohio?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
ohio...
would
ohio
give
credit
for
the
tax
that
its
sister
state
thinks
is
due?
what
is,
in
fact,
ohio's
tax
law
in
this
respect?
does
ohio
give
credit
to
taxes
paid
by
other
states...
to
other
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i
have
an
answer
to
a
very
simple
question?
if
illinois
claimed
the
tax,
would
ohio
give
credit
for
the
tax
paid
in
illinois?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
what...
what
ohio
does
in
these
situations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
the
answer
both?
why
isn't
the
answer
both,
just
as
here
it
is
both
a
paper
or
office
supply
company
and
a
lexis/nexis,
electronic
data
company?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
raising
it
in...
in
support
of
the
judgment.
so
if
it's
novel,
but
it
supports
the
judgment,
then
at
least
shouldn't
the
illinois
courts
have
a
chance
to
look
at
it
and
say,
oh,
that's
what
we
really
meant,
we
just
got...
explained
it
the
wrong
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
a
sale
of
stock
in
that
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
the
sale
of
a
subsidiary.
and
here
we
have
a
sale
of
assets
of
one
company,
and
that's
why
it's
so
hard
for
me
to
see
this,
as,
why
are
we
talking
about
unitary
or
not?
there
is
only
one
company;
it's
mead.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
told
me
that
there
was
no
case
that
the
tax...
taxing
authority
lost
that
involved
divisions
of
a
single
company
and
sale
of
assets,
rather
than
the
sale
of
stock.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we're
talking
about
what
due
process
permits
states
to
do,
and
you're
asking
us
to
declare
a
restriction
that,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
never
been
declared
in
any
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
just
that
it's
an
investment,
it's
not
just
that
it's
holding
on
to
the
shares
in
another
company.
it's
both
of
these
are
ongoing
businesses,
lexis/nexis
and
mead,
and
they
are
both
generating
income,
and
all
along
illinois
has
been
taxing
the
income
of
both
of
them,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
weren't
those
foreign
corporations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
running
them
as...
as
a
single
company
would
have
been
a
little
harder.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
there
is,
ms.
brinkmann.
the
illinois
appellate
court
never
got
to
that
question.
illinois
argued
all
along
this
is
a
unitary
business.
the
only
one
who
said
it
wasn't
was
this
trial
court,
and
the
illinois
intermediate
appellate
court
says,
well,
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that
because
if
you
use
the
other
label,
operational
function,
that
comes
out
all
right,
too.
but
this
argument
was
certainly
the
number
one
argument
that
illinois
was
making.
it
lost
only
in
the
trial
court
on...
on
it.
and
the
appellate
court
said
we
don't
have
to
get
to
it.
so
i
think
your
answer
to
justice
souter
really
wasn't
accurate
because
it
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--all
we
know
is
that
a
trial
judge
said
that
was
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
when
we're
talking
about
due
process
and
commerce
clause
limitations
on
what
states
can
tax,
we
ought
to
ask
ourselves
if
those
three...
is
that
it?
if
we're
trying
to
measure,
is
there
a
sufficient
relationship
between
lexis/nexis,
mead,
and
the
state
of
illinois
to
make
it
fair
for
them
to
tax?
and
you
say,
oh,
yes.
each
year
when
they're
making
income,
when
they
are
a
going
concern,
illinois
can
get
a
piece
of
it.
but
when
the
assets
are
sold,
assets
that
would
have
generated
income
for
illinois
year
after
year,
but
when
those
assets
are
sold,
illinois
can
get
nothing
to
represent...
to
substitute
for
that
stream
of
income
that
it
would
have
gotten.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
lexis/nexis
is
gone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it
had
been
delaware,
and
there
was
nothing
there
in
delaware
except
it
was
a
delaware
corporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
what...
or
did
you
know
what
ohio
did
in
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
what
would
you
say...
i
mean,
we
talk
about
apportioning
income
and
allocating
income,
allocating
to
the
commercial
headquarters.
what
in
an
enterprise
like
this
would
you
say
is
allocated
to
the
commercial
headquarters
as
opposed
to
being
apportioned
among
all
the
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
i'm
not
following
your
argument,
because
i
thought
that
the
argument
that
this
was
a
unitary
enterprise
was
made
in
the
illinois
appellate
court,
and
the
appellate
court
recognizes
that
it
was
made,
and
said
we
are
not
going
to
reach
it
because
we
have
this
operational
function
test?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
sort
of
stipulation
between
the
parties
to
say
what
each,
what
lexis/nexis
was
doing
in
illinois,
what
mead
was
doing
in
illinois?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
ask
you
about
the
theory
that
both
the
trial
court
and
the
intermediate
appellate
court
went
on,
this
operational
function
test,
which
has
been
brought
up
in
a
few
of
our
cases,
but
i
don't
know
any
that
was
decided.
did
we
ever
have
any
case
that
turned
on
the
operational
function
test
to
hold
for
the
state
taxing
authority?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
one
of
the
problems
with
applying
it
as
you
urge
here
is
that
that
would
just
override...
why
would
anyone
go
to
the
trouble
of
making
a
case
under
the
so
called
unitary
business
test,
because
the
operational
function
test
would
be
much
easier
to
meet?
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
say
you...
but
you
would
be
asking
us,
if
you
were
going
to
go
on
that
operational
function,
to
take
two
examples
that
were
given
in
allied-signal
that
are
quite
different
from
what's
involved
here,
and
to
make
that
a
doctrine
when
you
recognize
that
we
have
never
used
that
theory
to
hold
for
a
state
taxing
authority
in
the
context
of
a
multi
state
enterprise?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
illinois...
if
ohio
is,
in
fact,
taxing
the
whole
gain
at
its
full
rate
on
the
theory
that
this
entire
income
should
be
allocated
to
ohio,
then
you
do
have
an
element
of
double
taxation,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
"it"
to
tax,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
the
time
of
this
sale
of
lexis/nexis
assets,
there
was
only
one
taxpayer;
it
was
mead.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ohio.
