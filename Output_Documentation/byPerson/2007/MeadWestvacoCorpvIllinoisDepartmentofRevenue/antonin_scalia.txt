you
can't
have
a
unitary
business...
a
person
who
is
a
unitary
business.
i
mean,
a
person
can't
be
unitary
with
exxon.
i
mean,
when
you
speak
of
a
unitary
business
you're
talking
about
a
corporation
which,
you
know,
is
unitary
with
another
corporation.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
put
it
into
a
personal
taxation
scheme,
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
unitary
business
notion
has
no
application
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
not
wager,
however,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
taxing
mead,
not
nexis/lexis?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
relevance
is
it
that
nexis/lexis
has
business
in
illinois?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
that's
fine
if
that's
who
you're
taxing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
might
say
that
i
don't
follow
that.
it
seems
to
me
what
you
can
establish
from
the
fact
that
it
did
a
lot
of
business
in
illinois
is
that
can
you
tax
it
and...
but
i
don't
see
how.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
case
like
that
where
your
ability
to
tax
a
surviving
corporation
has
to
do
with,
not
whether
the
surviving
corporation
itself
has
sufficient
contacts
with
the
state,
but
whether
some
other
corporation
that
has
disappeared
now
but
that
merged
into
it
had
sufficient...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
establish
connection
with
the
taxpayer.
not...
not
with
somebody
from
whom
the
taxpayer
made
some
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
isn't
established
by
the
mere
fact
that
lexis/nexis
did
business
there.
ultimately
you
have
to
come
down
to
connecting
it
to
mead,
either
by
your
unitary
business
doctrine
or
by
this
functional
doctrine
that
you're
relying
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
tax
me
on
stock...
on
stock
that
i
own
on
companies
that
do
business
in
illinois?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
state
that
tries
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
extraordinary.
i
don't
know
of
any
tax
that
a
state
could
possibly
impose,
that
no
state
has
imposed.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
illinois
or
ohio,
were
you
talking
about?
