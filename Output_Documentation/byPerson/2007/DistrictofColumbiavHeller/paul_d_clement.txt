mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
amendment
to
the
constitution,
as
its
text
indicates,
guarantees
an
individual
right
that
does
not
depend
on
eligibility
for
or
service
in
the
militia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
we
don't
take
the
position
that
the
preamble
plays
no
role
in
interpreting
the
amendment.
and
we
would
point
to
this
court's
decision
in
miller,
for
example,
as
an
example
of
where
the
preamble
can
play
a
role
in
determining
the
scope--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--oh,
i
suppose
it
probably
does
define
two
rights
that
are
closely
related.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
the
better
view,
and
a
number
of
state
courts
that
have
interpreted
analogous
provisions
have
distinguished
between
the
two
rights
and
looked
at
them
differently.
and,
obviously,
the
term
"keep"
is
a
word
that
i
think
is
something
of
an
embarrassment
for
an
effort
to
try
to
imbue
every
term
in
the
operative
text
with
an
exclusively
military
connotation
because
that
is
not
one
that
really
has
an
exclusive
military
connotation.
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
"keep"
was
precisely
the
word
that
authorities
used
in
statutes
designed
specifically
to
disarm
individuals.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg,
and
just...
i
mean,
to
give
you
a
clear
example,
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
kind
of
plastic
guns
or
guns
that
are
specifically
designed
to
evade
metal
detectors
that
are
prohibited
by
federal
law
are
not
"arms"
within
the
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
and
are
not
protected
at
all.
and
that
would
be
the
way
we
would
say
that
you
should
analyze
that
provision
of
federal
law,
as
those
are
not
even
arms
within
the
provisions
of
the
second
amendment.
i
think
to
make
the
same
argument
about
machine
guns
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
argument,
to
say
the
least,
given
that
they
are
the
standard-issue
weapon
for
today's
armed
forces
and
the
state-organized
militia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
has
no
application
there.
as
i
say,
i
think
the
term
"arms",
especially
if
miller
is
going
to
continue
to
be
the
law,
is
influenced
by
the
preamble.
but
the
way
we
would
look
at
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
kennedy,
we
would
analyze
it
this
way,
which
is
we
would
say
that
probably
the
thing
that
was
foremost
in
the
framers'
minds
was
a
concern
that
the
militia
not
be
disarmed
such
that
it
would
be
maintained
as
a
viable
option
to
the
standing
army.
but
especially
when
you
remember,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
that
the
constitution
in
article
i,
section
8,
clauses
15
and
16,
the
militia
clauses,
as
unamended,
gave
the
federal
power...
the
federal
authorities
virtually
plenary
authority
to
deal
with
the
organization
and
regulation
of
the
militia.
the
most
obvious
way
that
you
could
protect
the
militia--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--except
for
that
which
is
reserved
in--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes...
no,
absolutely.
there
is
something
reserved
in
clause
16.
but
let
me
just
say,
if
the
second
amendment
had
the
meaning
that
the
district
of
columbia
ascribes
to
it,
one
would
certainly
think
that
james
madison,
when
he
proposed
the
second
amendment
would
have
proposed
it
as
an
amendment
to
article
i,
section
8,
clause
16.
he
didn't.
he
proposed
it
as
an
amendment
to
article
i,
section
9,
which
encapsulates
the
individual
rights
to
be
free
from
bills
of
retainder
and
ex
post
facto
clauses.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think...
i
think
pennsylvania
and
vermont
are
the
ones
that
most
obviously
protected.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
know
about
quite
clearly.
the
textual
indication
in
the
state
amendments
that
probably
most
obviously
goes
in
the
other
direction
is
the
phrase
"keep
and
bear
arms
for
the
common
defense.
"
and,
of
course,
there
was
a
proposal
during
the
debate
over
the
second
amendment
to
add
exactly
those
words
to
the
second
amendment,
and
that
proposal
was
defeated,
which
does--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
which
aspect
of
that
did
you
have
in
mind?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
but
i
don't
think
that
ever
made
it
to
the
floor
of
the
house
or
the
senate
that
i'm
aware
of.
and
i
think
that
this
happened
at
the
actual
senate
floor.
there
was
a
proposal
to
add
the
words
"in
the
common
defense",
and
that
was
rejected.
i
mean,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
do,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
in
that
regard
it
is
telling
that...
i
mean,
there
are
a
variety
of
provisions
in
our
bill
of
rights
that
were
borrowed
from
the
english
bill
of
rights.
two
very
principal
ones
are
the
right
to
petition
the
government
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
i
don't
think
it's
an
accident--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
you
could
say
the
same
thing
for
every
provision
of
the
english
bill
of
rights.
and
obviously,
when
those
were
translated
over
to
our
system
you
had
to
make
adjustment
for--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
souter.
and
the
way
i
counted
it,
i
only
found
three
provisions
in
the
english
bill
of
rights
that
had
a
comparable
reference
to
parliament.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
again,
that
is
also
true
and
is
also
relatively
unique
to
this
amendment.
and
if
i
get
to
the
point
in
the
argument
where
i
talk
about
why
we
think
that
something
less
than
strict
scrutiny
is
appropriate,
i
think
i
would
point
precisely
to
those
elements
of
the
english
bill
of
rights
as
being
relevant.
but
what
i
was
about
to
say
is
i
think
what
is
highly
relevant
in
considering
the
threshold
question
of
whether
there's
an
individual
right
here
at
all
is
that
the
parallel
provisions
in
the
english
bill
of
rights
that
were
borrowed
over
included
the
right
to
petition
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
both
of
those
appear
with
specific
parallel
references
to
the
people.
they
are
both
rights
that
are
given
to
the
people.
and
as
this
court
has
made
clear
in
verdugo-urquidez,
that's
a
reference
that
appears
throughout
the
bill
of
rights
as
a
reference
to
the
entire
citizenry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
way
i
would
read
it,
justice
souter,
is
that
"keep"
is
really
talking
about
private
possession
in
the
home.
and
the
way
that
i
would
look
at
it
is
in
order
to
exercise,
for
example,
an
opportunity
to
hunt,
that
you
would
need
to
bear
the
arms
as
well.
and
i
would
point
you...
i
think
it's
a
useful
point--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
say
that
and
so
would
madison
and
so
would
jefferson,
i
would
submit.
they
use--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
will
grant
you
this,
that
"bear
arms"
in
its
unmodified
form
is
most
naturally
understood
to
have
a
military
context.
but
i
think
the
burden
of
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
to
make
it
have
an
exclusively
military
context.
and
as
a
number
of
the
briefs
have
pointed
out,
that's
not
borne
out
by
the
framing
sources.
in
one
place,
although
it's
not
bearing
arms,
it's
bearing
a
gun,
i
think
it's
highly
relevant
that
madison
and
jefferson
with
respect
to
this
hunting
bill
that
jefferson
wrote
and
madison
proposed,
specifically
used
in
the
hunting
context
the
phrase
"bear
a
gun",
and
so
i
do
think
in
that
context--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
again,
i
think
various
phrases
were,
were
used.
i
also
think
that
some
of
the
disarmament
provisions
specifically
used
the
word
"keep".
and
so
i
think
there
is
some
independent
meaning
there,
which
is
one
point.
and
then
i
do
think
that,
even
in
the
context
of
bearing
arms,
i
will
grant
you
that
"arms"
has
a
military
connotation
and
i
think
miller
would
certainly
support
that,
but
i
don't
think
it's
an
exclusively
military
connotation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
absolutely.
and
i
grant
you
if
this,
if
the
second
amendment
said
"keep
and
bear
arms
for
the
common
defense.
"
this
would
be
a
different
case.
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean
it's...
it's
my
friends
from
the
district
that
are
emphasizing
that
no
word
in
the
constitution
is
surplusage.
so
i
would
say
that
in
a
context
like
this
you
might
want
to
focus
both
on
"keep"
and
on
"bear
arms".
mr.
paul
d.
clement
okay.
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
standard
and
my
light
is
indeed
on,
so
let
me
do
that.
i
think
there
are
several
reasons
why
a
standard
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief
rather
than
strict
scrutiny
is
an
appropriate
standard
to
be
applied
in
evaluating
these
laws.
i
think
first
and
foremost,
as
our
colloquy
earlier
indicated,
there
is...
the
right
to
bear
arms
was
a
preexisting
right.
the
second
amendment
talks
about
"the
right
to
bear
arms",
not
just
"a
right
to
bear
arms".
and
that
preexisting
always
coexisted
with
reasonable
regulations
of
firearms.
and
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
souter,
to
be
sure
when
you're
making
the
translation
from
the
english
bill
of
rights
you
always
have
to
deal
with
parliamentary
supremacy.
but
it
is
very
striking
that,
as
justice
stevens
said,
the
right
was
conditioned
on
the
conditions,
which
i
think
meant
what
class
you
were,
and
also
subject
expressly
to
the
parliament,
the
laws
of
parliament.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia,
let
me
make
two
related
points.
one,
even
in
the
first
amendment
context,
this
court
has
recognized...
and
i
point
you
to
the
court's
opinion
in
robertson
against
baldwin,
which
makes
this
point
as
to
both
the
first
and
the
second
amendment.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
certain
pre-existing
exceptions
that
are
so
well
established
that
you
don't
really
even
view
them
as
second
amendment
or
first
amendment
infringement.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
like
libel,
and
i
would
say
like
laws
barring
felons
from
possessing
handguns.
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
that
gets
to
the
self-defense
component
and
i
don't
know
that
i
ever
got
a
chance
to
fully
answer
your
question
on
that,
justice
kennedy,
which
is
we
would
say,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
preamble
makes
it
clear
that
the
preeminent
motive
was
related
to
ensuring
that
the
militia
remained
a
viable
option
vis-a-vis
the
standing
army,
the
operative
text
is
not
so
limited.
and
i
think
in
that
regard
it's
worth
emphasizing
that
the
framers
knew
exactly
how
to
condition
a
right
on
militia
service,
because
they
did
it
with
respect
to
the
grand
jury
clause,
and
they
didn't
do
it
with
respect
to
the
second
amendment.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
alito,
let
me
answer
the
question
in
two
parts
if
i
can,
because
i
think
the
analysis
of
the
trigger
lock
provision
may
well
be
different
than
the
analysis
of
the
other
provisions.
with
respect
to
the
trigger
lock
provision,
we
think
that
there
is
a
substantial
argument
that
once
this
court
clarifies
what
the
constitutional
standard
is,
that
there
ought
to
be
an
opportunity
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
urge
its
construction,
which
would
allow
for
a
relatively
robust
self-defense
exception
to
the
trigger
lock
provision.
and
this
court
could
very
well,
applying
ashwan
to
prevent...
principles
allow
for
that
kind
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--if
that's
going
to
be
the
exception,
it
could
clearly
be
inadequate.
and
i
think
that...
i
mean
the
district
of
columbia
can
speak
to
this,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if,
for
example,
the
police
were
executing
a
warrant
at
evening
and
had
cause
for
doing
it
at
evening
and
saw
somebody
with
a
loaded
gun
on
their
night
stand,
no
children
present
without
a
trigger
lock,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
good
test
case
to
decide
whether
or
not
their
construction
would
provide
for
an
exception
to
the
trigger
lock
provision
in
that
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
it
did,
i
think
then
the
statute
might
well
be
constitutional.
if
it
didn't,
in
my
view,
it
probably
wouldn't
be.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
in
our
view
it
makes
a
world
of
difference,
justice
ginsburg,
because
we
certainly
take
the
position,
as
we
have
since
consistently
since
2001,
that
the
federal
firearm
statutes
can
be
defended
as
constitutional,
and
that
would
be
consistent
with
this
kind
of
intermediate
scrutiny
standard
that
we
propose.
if
you
apply
strict
scrutiny,
i
think
that
the
result
would
be
quite
different,
unfortunately.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
say
a
couple
of
things
about
that,
which
is
to
say
that
if
this
court
were
to
decide
this
case
and
make
conclusively
clear
that
it
really
was
focused
very
narrowly
on
this
case
and
it
was
in
some
respects
applying
a
sui
generis
test,
we
think
that
would
be
an
improvement
over
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
which
is
subject
to
more
than
one
reading,
but
as
justice
ginsburg's
question
just
said,
it's
certainly
susceptible
to
a
reading
that
it
embodies
strict
scrutiny.
in
fact--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
our
principal
concern
based
on
the
parts
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
seemed
to
adopt
a
very
categorical
rule
were
with
respect
to
machine
guns,
because
i
do
think
that
it
is
difficult...
i
don't
want
to
foreclose
the
possibility
of
the
government,
federal
government
making
the
argument
some
day...
but
i
think
it
is
more
than
a
little
difficult
to
say
that
the
one
arm
that's
not
protected
by
the
second
amendment
is
that
which
is
the
standard
issue
armament
for
the
national
guard,
and
that's
what
the
machine
gun
is.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
why
one
might
worry
about
that
is
one
might
read
the
language
of
page
53a
of
the
opinion
as
reproduced
in
the
petition
appendix
that
says
once
it
is
an
arm,
then
it
is
not
open
to
the
district
to
ban
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
is
not
strictly
a
complete
ban
because
it
exempts
pre-1976
handguns.
the
federal
ban
on
machine
guns
is
not,
strictly
speaking,
a
ban,
because
it
exempts
pre...
pre-law
machine
guns,
and
there
is
something
like
160,000
of
those.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i...
i
hope
that
you
read
it
that
way.
but
i
would
also
say
that
i
think
that
whatever
the
definition
that
the
lower
court
opinion
employed,
i
do
think
it's
going
to
be
difficult
over
time
to
sustain
the
notion...
i
mean,
the
court
of
appeals
also
talked
about
lineal
descendants.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that,
you
know,
just
as
this
court
would
apply
the
fourth
amendment
to
something
like
heat
imagery,
i
don't
see
why
this
court
wouldn't
allow
the
second
amendment
to
have
the
same
kind
of
scope,
and
then
i
do
think
that
reasonably
machine
guns
come
within
the
term
"arms".
now,
if
this
court
wants
to
say
that
they
don't...
i
mean...
i
mean...
we'd
obviously
welcome
that
in
our...
in
our
obligation
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
acts
of
congress.
the
one
other
thing
i
would
say
is
that
this
is
an
opinion
that
is
susceptible
of
different
readings.
it's
interesting
that
respondents'
amici
have
different
characterizations
of
it.
the
goldwater
institute
calls
it
strict
scrutiny;
the
state
of
texas
calls
it
reasonable...
reasonableness
review.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you.
