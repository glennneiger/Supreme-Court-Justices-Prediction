justice
john
paul
stevens
may
ask
this
question,
mr.
dellinger?
to
what
extent
do
you
think
the
similar
provisions
in
state
constitutions
that
were
adopted
more
or
less
at
the
same
time
are
relevant
to
our
inquiry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
talking
about
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
the
contemporaneous
actions
of
the
states,
before
or
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
second
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
bill
of
rights
only
protected
the
rights
of
protestants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
was
suitable
to
their
conditions
then
as
allowed
by
law,
so
it
was...
it
was
a
group
right
and
much
more
limited.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question.
do
you
think
it
has
the
same
meaning
that
it
would
have
if
it
omitted
the
introductory
clause
referring
to
militia?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
some
weight
should
be
given
to
the
clause.
and
also,
the
other
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is:
does
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
define
one
or
two
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
a
right
to
keep
arms
and
a
right
to
bear
arms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
plenary
authority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
appoints
the
officers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
he
was
guided
at
all
by
the
contemporaneous
provisions
in
state
constitutions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
many
of
them
protected
an
individual
right?
just
two,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
others
quite
clearly
went
in
the
other
direction,
did
they
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
also
a
proposal
to
make
it
clear
there
was
an
individual
right,
which
was
also
rejected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
pennsylvania
proposal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
provision
has
the
additional
limitation
to
"suitable
to
their
conditions",
and
a
large
number
of
people
were
not
permitted
to
have
arms.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
miller,
but
the
massachusetts
declaration.
"the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
for
the
common
defense.
"
is
what
is
the
normal
reading
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
right
to
keep
and
bear...
i'm
sorry.
it's
one
right
to
keep
and
bear,
not
two
rights,
to
keep
and
to
bear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question:
in
answering
yes,
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
the
reference
to
the
militia
in
the
second
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that
is...
to
understand
the
amendment,
you
must
pay
some
attention
to
the
militia
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
limits
the
kinds
of
arms
to
be
appropriate
to
a
militia,
why
does
it
not
also
limit
the
kind
of
people
who
may
have
arms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
you
include
self-defense,
but
only
two
states,
pennsylvania
and
vermont,
did
refer
to
self-defense
as
a
permissible
justification
and
all
of
the
others
referred
to
common
defense
or
defense
of
the
state,
and
in
the
articles
of
confederation
and
the
constitution
itself
there
is
no
reference
to
self-defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
1895.
i'm
talking
about
contemporaneous
with
the
adoption
of
the
second
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
the
text
of
the
state
constitutional
provisions,
two
of
them
refer
to
self-defense.
the
rest
refer
only
to
common
defense;
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
judicial
interpretation
sometimes
is
controlling
and
sometimes
is
not.
but
the
text
itself
does
draw
a
distinction,
just
as
the
second
amendment
does.
it
doesn't
mention
self-defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
look
at
the
individual
rights
i
suppose
you
start
back
in
1689,
the
declaration
of
rights
in
england.
and
the
seventh
provision
that
they
talked
about
said
that:
"the
subjects
which
are
protestants
may
have
arms
for
their
defense
suitable
to
their
conditions
and
as
allowed
by
law.
"
now
do
you
think
the
term
"suitable
to
their
conditions"
limited
the
number
of
people
who
had
access
to
arms
for
self-defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
that
the
second
amendment
is
a
departure
from
the
provision
in
the
declaration
of
rights
in
england?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that's
not
really
your...
you
would
not
confine
the
right
the
way
the
english
did
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
the
right
of
self-defense
was
the
heart
of
the
second
amendment,
in
your
view.
strangely
that
some
provisions
suggested
that
and
were
not
accepted
by
the
authors
of
the
second
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
pennsylvania.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
are
you,
in
effect,
reading
the
amendment
to
say
that
the
right
shall
not
be
unreasonably
infringed
instead
of
shall
not
be
infringed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
can...
consistent
with
your
view,
we
can
simply
read
this:
"it
shall
not
be
unreasonably
infringed?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
about
a
state
university
wants
to
ban
students
having
arms
in
the
dormitory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
bare
fact.
that's
what...
a
state
regulation
prohibits
students
from
having
arms
on
campus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
have
to
think
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
two
dissenting
opinions
that
justice
breyer
and
i
have
filed
set
forth
independent
reasons
for
concluding
that
the
court
is
quite
wrong
today.
the
fact
that
individuals
may
enforce
the
right
protected
by
the
second
amendment
tells
us
nothing
about
the
scope
of
the
right.
guns
are
used
to
hunt,
for
self
defense,
to
commit
crimes,
for
sporting
activities
and
to
perform
military
duties.
the
second
amendment
plainly
does
not
protect
the
right
to
use
a
gun
to
rob
a
bank.
it
is
equally
clear
that
it
does
encompass
the
right
to
use
weapons
for
certain
military
purposes,
whether
it
also
protects
the
right
to
--
to
posses
and
use
guns
for
non-military
purposes
like
hunting
and
personal
self
defense
is
the
question
presented
by
this
case.
rather
than
attempt
to
summarize
my
lengthy
opinion,
i
shall
merely
identify
eight
reasons
why
most
judges
would
endorse
the
narrower,
militia
related
reading
of
the
amendment.
first,
it
is
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
27-word
text.
that
text
protects
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
makes
no
mention
of
any
non-military
use
of
a
firearm.
it
protects
the
preexisting
right
to
use
guns
by
members
of
a
militia.
the
centerpiece
of
the
court's
analysis
of
the
text
today
is
its
assumption
that
the
words
"the
people"
describe
the
same
class
of
persons
as
those
words
described
in
the
first
and
fourth
amendments,
all
members
of
the
political
community,
not
in
unspecified
subset
like
just
the
militia.
but
it
is
well
established
that
the
people
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
include
convicted
felons
and
mentally
incompetent
persons
and
many
that
are
not
capable
of
handling
firearms.
the
court
assures
us,
however,
that
law
abiding
and
responsible
citizens
are
the
only
subset
of
people
entitled
to
bear
arms.
but
that
assurance
which
comes
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
totally
eviscerates
the
basis
for
the
court's
elaborate
attempt
to
justify
its
claim
that
the
text
means
more
than
it
says
and
serves
a
purpose
far
broader
than
that
identified
in
its
preamble.
second,
if
the
text
were
ambiguous
and
the
long
discussion
of
language
in
the
court's
opinion
may
support
its
clearer
that
it
is
ambiguous
at
the
very
least,
i
don't
think
it
is
ambiguous,
but
if
it
were,
the
clear
statement
of
purpose
in
its
preamble
would
provide
the
basis
for
--
for
resolving
any
ambiguity.
the
preamble
clearly
contemplates
the
use
of
arms
in
a
militia.
third,
the
principle
draftsman
of
the
amendment,
james
madison,
not
man
who
wrote
generations
later
and
commentators
and
so,
james
madison
and
those
who
participated
in
the
deliberations
leading
to
the
enactment
of
the
amendment
considered
and
rejected
proposal
similar
to
those
contained
in
some
contemporary
state
constitutions
which
the
majority
opinion
quotes
at
length
which
would
have
protected
none
military
uses
of
weapons.
thus
a
fair
analysis
of
the
original
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
amendment
supports
a
narrower
reading.
fourth,
it
is
the
reading
that
this
court
adopted
in
1939
in
miller,
an
unanimous
opinion
which
speaks
for
itself,
do
not
accept
the
summary
of
the
opinion
you
have
just
heard.
for
example,
the
concern
about
only
one
party
participating
in
the
argument
was
also
true
of
marbury
against
madison,
a
case
which
should
not
be
ignored
just
for
that
reason.
the
word
stare
decisis
which
do
not
appear
in
the
majority
opinion
today
would
normally
compel
--
would
normally
counsel
adherence
to
settled
law.
fifth,
no
previously
unavailable
historical
evidence
has
surfaced
since
the
1939
when
miller
was
described
the
decided
nor
does
the
court
rely
on
any
such
evidence
as
a
basis
for
distinguishing
miller
in
making
a
new
law
and
is
making
a
new
law
today.
sixth,
not
only
hundreds
of
federal
judges
but
also
countless
legislatures
have
relied
on
the
view
endorsed
in
miller,
the
view
was
perfectly
clear
to
them.
seventh,
regulation
of
the
civilian
use
of
firearms
raises
complex
and
critically
important
questions
of
public
policy
that
have
heretofore
and
resolve
exclusively
by
the
political
branches
of
our
government,
this
court
should
stay
out
of
that
political
thicket.
eighth,
the
chasm
between
the
court's
rather
grandiose
and
detailed
analysis
and
its
narrow
holding
demonstrates
that
this
is
just
the
first
in
the
series
of
decisions
that
the
court
will
be
required
to
make
in
order
to
define
the
dimensions
of
its
newly
discovered
right.
the
courts
claim
that
the
amendment
was
a
codification
of
a
common
law
rule,
not
mentioned
any
memo
is
fully
consistent
with
an
expectation
that
its
dimensions,
the
dimensions
of
the
rule
must
be
determined
by
the
process
of
common
law,
case-by-case
adjudication.
unlike
other
common
law
rules,
however,
and
especially
those
fashioned
in
england
and
particularly
the
english
bill
of
rights
rule,
this
rule
is
not
subject
to
amendment
by
the
legislature.
justice
breyer's
separate
dissent
an
opinion
explains
why
at
a
minimum
the
district
of
columbia's
laws
amount
to
reasonable
and
appropriate
regulation
consistent
with
the
second
amendment.
he
explains
that
there
is
no
sound
basis
--
sound
legal
basis
for
launching
the
courts
on
the
formidable
and
perilous
mission
began
today.
in
our
view,
there
is
no
untouchable
constitutional
right
guaranteed
by
the
second
amendment
to
keep
loaded
handguns
in
the
house
in
urban
areas.
it
was
only
a
few
years
after
the
decision
in
miller
that
justice
frankfurter
wrote
his
famous
opinion,
warning
of
the
perils
of
this
court's
into
a
--
entry
into
a
political
thicket.
the
political
thicket
that
the
court
has
decided
to
enter
today
is
different
from
but
no
less
controversial
than
the
one
that
concerned
justice
frankfurter,
a
genuine
judicial
conservative.
what
impact
the
court's
totally
unnecessary
entry
into
this
attainable
will
have
on
the
ongoing
debate
between
the
advocates
and
opponents
of
gun
control
and
indeed,
on
this
court's
role
as
a
guardian
of
the
rule
of
law
in
a
matter
that
will
be
debated
by
future
historians
at
length.
it
is,
however,
clear
to
us
that
adherence
through
a
policy
of
judicial
restraint
would
be
far
wiser
than
the
bold
decision
announced
today.
