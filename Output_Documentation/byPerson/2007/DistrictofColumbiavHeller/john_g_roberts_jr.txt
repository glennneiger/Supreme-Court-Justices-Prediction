chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
today
in
case
07-290,
district
of
columbia
versus
heller.
mr.
dellinger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you're
right,
mr.
dellinger,
it's
certainly
an
odd
way
in
the
second
amendment
to
phrase
the
operative
provision.
if
it
is
limited
to
state
militias,
why
would
they
say
"the
right
of
the
people"?
in
other
words,
why
wouldn't
they
say
"state
militias
have
the
right
to
keep
arms?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
that's
right,
doesn't
that
cut
against
you?
if
the
militia
included
all
the
people,
doesn't
the
preamble
that
you
rely
on
not
really
restrict
the
right
much
at
all?
it
includes
all
the
people.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
that
concedes
your
main
point
that
there
is
an
individual
right
and
gets
to
the
separate
question
of
whether
the
regulations
at
issue
here
are
reasonable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
your
reading
of
the
militia
clause,
the
militia
clause
specifically
reserves
certain
rights
to
the
states
by
its
terms.
and
as
i
understand
your
reading,
you
would
be
saying
the
second
amendment
was
designed
to
take
away
or
expand
upon
the
rights
that
are
reserved,
rather
than
simply
guaranteeing
what
rights
were
understood
to
be
implicit
in
the
constitution
itself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
militia
clause,
article
i,
section
8,
says
certain
rights
are
reserved
to
the
states
with
respect
to
the
militia.
and
yet
you're
telling
us
now
that
this
was
a
very
important
right
that
ensured
that
they
kept
arms,
but
it
wasn't
listed
in
the
rights
that
were
reserved
in
the
militia
clause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is...
what
is
reasonable
about
a
total
ban
on
possession?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
have
a
law
that
prohibits
the
possession
of
books,
it's
all
right
if
you
allow
the
possession
of
newspapers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
regulation...
the
regulation
at
issue
here
is
not
one
that
goes
to
the
number
of
guns.
it
goes
to
the
specific
type.
and
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
in
your
brief
that
because
rifles
and
shotguns
are
not
banned
to
the
same
extent
as
handguns,
it's
all
right
to
ban
handguns.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
accurate
to
say
the
opinion
below
allowed
those.
the
law
that
the
opinion,
the
court
below,
was
confronted
with
was
a
total
ban,
so
that
was
the
only
law
they
considered.
if
the
district
passes
a
ban
on
machine
guns
or
whatever,
then
that
law...
that
law
would
be
considered
by
the
court
and
perhaps
would
be
upheld
as
reasonable.
but
the
only
law
they
had
before
them
was
a
total
ban.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
allowed
to
carry
the
weapons
that
are
allowed?
i
read
the
"carry
clause"
to
apply
without
qualification.
so
while
you
say
you
might
be
able
to
have
a
shotgun
in
the
home,
you
can't
carry
it
to
get
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
remain,
mr.
dellinger.
we'll
make
sure
you
have
rebuttal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dellinger.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
these
various
phrases
under
the
different
standards
that
are
proposed,
"compelling
interest",
"significant
interest",
"narrowly
tailored",
none
of
them
appear
in
the
constitution;
and
i
wonder
why
in
this
case
we
have
to
articulate
an
all-encompassing
standard.
isn't
it
enough
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
existing
right
that
the
amendment
refers
to,
look
at
the
various
regulations
that
were
available
at
the
time,
including
you
can't
take
the
gun
to
the
marketplace
and
all
that,
and
determine
how
these...
how
this
restriction
and
the
scope
of
this
right
looks
in
relation
to
those?
i'm
not
sure
why
we
have
to
articulate
some
very
intricate
standard.
i
mean,
these
standards
that
apply
in
the
first
amendment
just
kind
of
developed
over
the
years
as
sort
of
baggage
that
the
first
amendment
picked
up.
but
i
don't
know
why
when
we
are
starting
afresh,
we
would
try
to
articulate
a
whole
standard
that
would
apply
in
every
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
this
law
didn't
involve
a
restriction
on
machine
guns.
it
involved
an
absolute
ban.
it
involved
an
absolute
carry
prohibition.
why
would
you
think
that
the
opinion
striking
down
an
absolute
ban
would
also
apply
to
a
narrow
one...
narrower
one
directed
solely
to
machine
guns?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
gura.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
a
conscientious
objector
who
likes
to
hunt
deer
for
food,
you
would
say,
has
no
rights
under
the
second
amendment.
he
is
not
going
to
be
part
of
the
militia.
he
is
not
going
to
be
part
of
the
common
defense,
but
he
still
wants
to
bear
arms.
you
would
say
that
he
doesn't
have
any
rights
under
this
amendment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
parallel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
there
any
parallel
at
the
time
that
the
amendment
was
adopted
to
the
machine
gun?
in
other
words,
i
understand
your
point
to
be
that,
although
that's
useful
in
modern
military
service,
it's
not
something
civilians
possess.
was
there
anything
like
that
at
the
time
of
the
adoption,
or
were
the
civilian
arms
exactly
the
same
as
the
ones
you'd
use
in
the
military?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
the
trigger-lock
provisions
that
are
at
issue
here,
why
aren't
they
similar
to
the
various
provisions
that
justice
breyer
mentioned
like
the
gunpowder
restriction?
in
other
words,
for
reasons
of
domestic
safety,
they
said
you
can't
store
the
gunpowder
anywhere
but
on
the
top
floor.
why
isn't
the
modern
trigger-lock
provision
similar
to
those?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
is
always
a
risk
that
the
children
will
get
up
and
grab
the
firearm
and
use
it
for
some
purpose
other
than
what
the
second
amendment
was
designed
to
protect.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
right.
but,
i
mean,
you
don't
necessarily
expect
a
young
child
to
be
able
to
reassemble
the
pistol.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about...
what
about
age
limits...
you've
got
to
be
over
18
or
you've
got
to
be
over
21
to
get
a
license?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
age
limit
necessarily
the
same
nationwide?
maybe
16
in
wyoming
makes
more
sense
but
21
in
the
district.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
would
define
"reasonable"
in
light
of
the
restrictions
that
existed
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
adopted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
you
can't
take
it
into
the
marketplace
was
one
restriction.
so
that
would
be...
we
are
talking
about
lineal
descendents
of
the
arms
but
presumably
there
are
lineal
descendents
of
the
restrictions
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
gura.
mr.
dellinger,
10
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
before
you
start
with
it,
how
many
minutes
does
it
take
to
remove
a
trigger
lock
and
load
a
gun?
because
both
the
gun
has
to
be
unloaded;
it
has
to
have
a
trigger
lock
under
the
district
laws.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
disassembled--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
either
case
it
has
to
be
unloaded,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
law,
as
i
understand
it,
says
that
the
gun
has
to
be
unloaded.
so
under
your
hypothetical,
i
assume
that
would
violate
the
district's
law
if
the
gun
is
still
loaded.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
long
does
it
take?
if
your
interpretation
is
correct,
how
long
does
it
take
to
remove
the
trigger
lock
and
make
the
gun
operable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
like
that?
is
it
a
numerical
code?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
you
turn
on
the
lamp,
you
pick
up
your
reading
glasses...--
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
may
not
matter,
but
i'd
like
some
idea
about
how
long
it
takes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
proportionate,
in
other
words
you're
saying
your
interest
is
allowing
self-defense
in
the
home--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--does
it
really
make
sense
to
say
the
best
self-defense
arm
is
a
rifle,
as
opposed
to
a
pistol?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
related
point.
do
you
understand
the
ban...
the
carry
ban
to
apply
if
you
carry
the
firearm
from
one
room
in
the
house
to
another?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
the...
why
is
the
d.c.
law
phrased
in
those
terms?
in
other
words,
if
you
can't
have
a
handgun
at
all,
why
do
you
have
a
separate
provision
saying
that
you
can't
carry
it
anywhere?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
that
covered
by
the
provision
that
you
have
the
right
to
keep
arms?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dellinger.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
also
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-290,
district
of
columbia
versus
heller.
