could
you
go
back
to
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
just
wondered
if
you
could
say
in
a
minute.
one
possibility
is
that
the
amendment
gives
nothing
more
than
a
right
to
the
state
to
raise
a
militia.
a
second
possibility
is
that
it
gives
an
individual
right
to
a
person,
but
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
people
to
have
guns
to
form
a
militia.
assume
the
second.
if
you
assume
the
second,
i
wanted
you
to
respond
if
you...
unless
you
have
done
so
fully
already,
to
what
was
the
chief
justice's
question
of
why,
on
the
second
assumption,
this
ban
on
handguns,
not
the
other
part,
of
the
district
of
columbia,
a
total
ban,
why
is
that
a
reasonable
regulation
viewed
in
terms
of
the
purposes
as
i
described
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
that
this
is
unreasonable,
and
that
really
is
my
question
because
i'd
like
you
to
assume
two
things
with
me,
which
you
probably
don't
agree
with,
and
i
may
not
agree
with
them,
either.
[laughter]
but
i
just
want
you
to
assume
them
for
the
purpose
of
the
question.
all
right.
assume
that
the...
that
there
is
an
individual
right,
but
the
purpose
of
that
right
is
to
maintain
a
citizen
army;
call
it
a
militia;
that
that's
the
basic
purpose.
so
it
informs
what's
reasonable
and
what
isn't
reasonable.
assume...
and
this
is
favorable
to
you
but
not
as
favorable
as
you'd
like...
assume
that
we
are
going
to
decide
whether
something
is
proportionate
or
apply
an
intermediate
standard
in
light
of
the
purpose.
now,
focus
on
the
handgun
ban.
as
i
read
these
80
briefs...
and
they
were
very
good,
i
mean
really
good
and
informative
on
both
sides...
and
i'm
trying
to
boil
down
the
statistics
where
there
is
disagreement,
and
roughly
what
i
get...
and
don't
quarrel
with
this
too
much;
it's
very
rough...
that
80,000
to
100,000
people
every
year
in
the
united
states
are
either
killed
or
wounded
in
gun-related
homicides
or
crimes
or
accidents
or
suicides,
but
suicide
is
more
questionable.
that's
why
i
say
80,000
to
100,000.
in
the
district,
i
guess
the
number
is
somewhere
around
200
to
300
dead;
and
maybe,
if
it's
similar,
1,500
to
2,000
people
wounded.
now,
in
light
of
that,
why
isn't
a
ban
on
handguns,
while
allowing
the
use
of
rifles
and
muskets,
a
reasonable
or
a
proportionate
response
on
behalf
of
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
didn't
read...
i
read
the
two
military
briefs
as
focusing
on
the
nature
of
the
right,
which
was
quite
a
pretty
good
argument
there
that
the
nature
of
the
right
is
to
maintain
a
citizen
army.
and
to
maintain
that
potential
today,
the
closest
we
come
is
to
say
that
there
is
a
right
for
people
to
understand
weapons,
to
know
how
to
use
them,
to
practice
with
them.
and
they
can
do
that,
you
see,
with
their
rifles.
they
can
go
to
gun
ranges,
i
guess,
in
neighboring
states.
but
does
that
make
it
unreasonable
for
a
city
with
a
very
high
crime
rate,
assuming
that
the
objective
is
what
the
military
people
say,
to
keep
us
ready
for
the
draft,
if
necessary,
is
it
unreasonable
for
a
city
with
that
high
crime
rate
to
say
no
handguns
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
want
to
say
yes,
that's
correct,
but
i
want
to
hear
what
the
reasoning
is
because
there
is
a
big
crime
problem.
i'm
simply
getting
you
to
focus
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
brings
me
back
to
the
question
because
blackstone
describes
it
as
a
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
"under
law".
and
since
he
uses
the
words
"under
law",
he
clearly
foresees
reasonable
regulation
of
that
right.
and
so
does
the
case
not
hinge
on,
even
given
all
your
views,
on
whether
it
is
or
is
not
a
reasonable
or
slightly
tougher
standard
thing
to
do
to
ban
the
handgun,
while
leaving
you
free
to
use
other
weapons?
i
mean,
i
notice
that
the
militia
statute,
the
first
one,
spoke
of
people
coming
to
report,
in
1790,
or
whenever,
with
their
rifles,
with
their
muskets,
but
only
the
officers
were
to
bring
pistols.
so
that,
to
me,
suggests
they
didn't
see
pistols
as
crucial
even
then,
let
alone
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
response
to
the
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
now,
when
say
"keep"
and
"bear",
i
mean
you
are...
i
think
you're
on
to
something
here.
because
you
say
let's
use
our
common
sense
and
see
what
would
be
the
equivalent
today.
fine.
if
we
know
that
at
the
time,
in
1789,
massachusetts
had
a
law
that
said
you
cannot
keep
loaded
firearms
in
the
house,
right,
and
you
have
to
keep
all
of
the
bullets
and
everything
and
all
of
the
powder
upstairs,
why
did
they
have
that
law?
to
stop
fires
because
it's
dangerous?
they
didn't
have
fire
departments.
now
we
do...
or
they
weren't
as
good.
we
now
have
police
departments,
and
the
crime
wave
might
be
said
similar
to
what
were
fires
then.
and,
therefore,
applying
the
similar
kind
of
thing,
you
say:
fine,
just
as
you
could
keep
pistols
loaded
but
not...
not
loaded.
you
had
to
keep
powder
upstairs
because
of
the
risk
of
fire.
so
today,
roughly,
you
can
say
no
handguns
in
the
city
because
of
the
risk
of
crime.
things
change.
but
we
give
in
both
instances,
then
and
now,
leeway
to
the
city
and
states
to
work
out
what's
reasonable
in
light
of
their
problems.
would
that
be
a
way
of
approaching
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
self-defense
being
the
harm.
and
i
agree
with
you
that
this,
the
firearm
analogy,
floats
up
there,
but
it
isn't
going
to
decide
this
case,
the
massachusetts
statute.
i
agree
with
you
about
that.
what
you've
suddenly
given
me
the
idea
of
doing,
which
i'm
testing,
is
to
focus
not
just
on
what
the
kind
of
weapon
is...
don't
just
look
to
see
whether
it's
a
cannon
or
a
machine
gun,
but
look
to
see
what
the
purpose
of
this
regulation
is,
and
does
it
make
sense
in
terms
of
having
the
possibility
of
people
trained
in
firearms?
let's
look
at
those
military
briefs.
let's
say
that
the
generals
have
it
right,
there
is
some
kind
of
right
to
keep
trained
in
the
use
of
firearms
subject
to
regulation.
we
have
regulation
worried
about
crime,
back
to
my
first
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thinking
of
your
exchange
with
the
chief
justice
and
think
of
the
trigger
lock
in
your
view
and
what
the
question
was,
do
you
want...
i
don't
know
how
well
trigger
locks
work
or
not...
but
do
you
want
thousands
of
judges
all
over
the
united
states
to
be
deciding
that
kind
of
question
rather
than
the
city
councils
and
the
legislatures
that
have
decided
it
in
the
context
of
passing
laws?
i
mean,
isn't
there
an
issue
here
and
a
problem
with
respect
to
having
courts
make
the
kinds
of
decisions
about
who
is
right
or
not
in
that
trigger-lock
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whose
judgment
is
that
to--
