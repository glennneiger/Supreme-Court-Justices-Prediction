justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
the
concerns,
mr.
dellinger,
of
the
framers,
was
not
to
establish
a
practice
of
amending
the
constitution
and
its
important
provisions,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
an
interpretation
of
the
second
amendment
differing
from
that
of
the
district
court
and
in
miller
and
not
advanced
particularly
in
the
red
brief,
but
that
conforms
the
two
clauses
and
in
effect
delinks
them.
the
first
clause
i
submit
can
be
read
consistently
with
the
purpose
i've
indicated
of
simply
reaffirming
the
existence
and
the
importance
of
the
militia
clauses.
those
were
very
important
clauses.
as
you've
indicated,
they're
in
article
i
and
article
ii.
and
so
in
effect
the
amendment
says
we
reaffirm
the
right
to
have
a
militia,
we've
established
it,
but
in
addition,
there
is
a
right
to
bear
arms.
can
you
comment
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
makes,
it
does...
i
think
you're
quite
right
in
the
brief
to
say
that
the
preface
shouldn't
be
extraneous.
this
means
it's
not
extraneous.
the
constitution
reaffirms
the
rights,
reaffirm
several
principles:
the
right
of
the
people
to
peaceably
assemble,
the
right
to
be
secure
in
their
homes,
the
tenth
amendment
reaffirms
the
rights,
and
this
is
simply
a
reaffirmation
of
the
militia
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
the
subject
is
"arms"
in
both
clauses,
as
i've
suggested
is
the
common
subject,
and
they're
closely
related.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
the
clause,
the
second
clause,
the
operative
clause,
is
related
to
something
other
than
the
militia?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
well,
then--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
concern
of
the
remote
settler
to
defend
himself
and
his
family
against
hostile
indian
tribes
and
outlaws,
wolves
and
bears
and
grizzlies
and
things
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
second...
the
second
amendment
doesn't
repeal
that.
you
don't
take
the
position
that
congress
no
longer
has
the
power
to
organize,
arm,
and
discipline
the
militia,
do
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
was
supplementing
it.
and
my
question
is,
the
question
before
us,
is
how
and
to
what
extent
did
it
supplement
it.
and
in
my
view
it
supplemented
it
by
saying
there's
a
general
right
to
bear
arms
quite
without
reference
to
the
militia
either
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there's
no
question
that
the
english
struggled
with
how
to
work
this.
you
couldn't
conceal
a
gun
and
you
also
couldn't
carry
it,
but
yet
you
had
a
right
to
have
it.
let
me
ask
you
this:
do
you
think
the
second
amendment
is
more
restrictive
or
more
expansive
of
the
right
than
the
english
bill
of
rights
in
1689?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that
would
be
more
restrictive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
purposes
of
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
there
is
no
showing
that
rifles
and
handguns.
i
think
you
meant
rifles
and
other
guns.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
what?
what
is
the
purpose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
could
just
have
one
follow-on
on
justice
ginsburg
real
quick.
do
those
states...
justice
ginsburg
asked...
that
distinguish
among
weapons,
state
constitutional
provisions
do
not
do
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
i
did
interrupt
justice
breyer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
your
view
this
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
of
people
living
in
the
wilderness
to
protect
themselves,
despite
maybe
an
attempt
by
the
federal
government,
which
is
what
the
second
amendment
applies
to,
to
take
away
their
weapons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree
that
miller
is
consistent
with
what
you've
just
said,
but
it
seems
to
me
miller,
which
kind
of
ends
abruptly
as
an
opinion
writing
anyway,
is
just
insufficient
to
subscribe...
to
describe
the
interests
that
must
have
been
foremost
in
the
framers'
minds
when
they
were
concerned
about
guns
being
taken
away
from
the
people
who
needed
them
for
their
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
madison
was
guided
by
the
experience
and
the
expressions
of
the
right
in
english
law,
including
the
bill
of
rights
of
1689?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
would
you
say
like
protecting
yourself
against
intruders
in
the
home?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
it
also
be
simply
to
reaffirm
that
the
provisions
in
the
main
text
of
the
constitution
remain
intact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
were
about
to
tell
us
before
the
course
of
the
questioning
began
about
the
other
purposes
that
the
amendment
served.
i'm...
i
want
to
know
whether
or
not,
in
your
view,
the
operative
clause
of
the
amendment
protects,
or
was
designed
to
protect
in
an
earlier
time,
the
settler
in
the
wilderness
and
his
right
to
have
a
gun
against
some
conceivable
federal
enactment
which
would
prohibit
him
from
having
any
guns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
are
not
appropriate
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
that
miller,
as
we're
discussing
it
now,
and
the
whole
idea
that
the
militia
clause
has
a
major
effect
in
interpreting
the
operative
clause
is
both
overinclusive
and
underinclusive.
i
would
have
to
agree
with
justice
ginsburg
that
a
machine
gun
is
probably
more
related
to
the
militia
now
than
a
pistol
is.
but
that...
that
seems
to
me
to
be
allowing
the
militia
clause
to
make
no
sense
out
of
the
operative
clause
in
present-day
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
point
is:
why
is
that
of
any
real
relevance
to
the
situation
that
faces
the
homeowner
today?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
being
faithful
to
miller.
i
suggest
that
miller
may
be
deficient.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
to
be
clear...
and
i
don't
want
to
misstate
your
position,
but
my
understanding,
i
at
least
inferred
that
you
would
consider
it
reasonable
to
ban
shipment
of
machine
guns
and
sawed-off
shotguns
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
at
least
to
me
the
question
is,
what
would
be
the
constitutional
basis
for
insisting
on
justice
scalia's
suggestion
that
you
need
a
number
of
guns?
you
have
argued,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
district
or
a
government
could
prohibit
just
what
he
said,
unless
you
needed
one
to
take
to
the
militia.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
about
the
constitutional
standard
you
apply
to
a
hypothetical
statute
which
would
prohibit
the
guns
justice
scalia
described.
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
validity
of
such
a
hypothetical
law?
