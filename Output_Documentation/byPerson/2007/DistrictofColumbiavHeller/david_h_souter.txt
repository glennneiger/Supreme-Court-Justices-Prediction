justice
david
h.
souter
so
what
you
are...
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
individual
has
a
right
to
challenge
a
federal
law
which
in
effect
would
disarm
the
militia
and
make
it
impossible
for
the
militia
to
perform
those
functions
that
militias
function.
isn't
that
the
nub
of
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
isn't
it...
isn't
it
more
restrictive
in
the
sense
that
the
english
bill
of
rights
was
a
guarantee
against
the
crown,
and
it
did
not
preclude
parliament
from
passing
a
statute
that
would
regulate
and
perhaps
limit--
justice
david
h.
souter
--here
there
is
some
guarantee
against
what
congress
can
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
there
one
difference?
not
every
provision
of
the
english
bill
of
rights
had
an
express
reference
to
permission
by
law,
which
is
a
reference
to
parliamentary
authority.
so
that
there...
there...
there
was
a
peculiar
recognition
of
parliamentary
legislative
authority
on
this
subject.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
another
point,
which
is
to
the
same
point,
and
that
is
consistent
with
your
emphasis
on
the
people
was
your
emphasis
a
moment
ago
on
the
distinction
between
keeping
and
bearing
arms.
the
"keep"
part
sounds
in
your,
in
your
mind
at
least,
to
speak
of
an
individual
right
not
necessarily
limited
by,
by
the
exigencies
of
military
service.
my
question
is,
if
that
is
correct
and
"keep"
should
be
read
as,
in
effect,
an
independent
guarantee,
then
what
is
served
by
the
phrase
"and
bear"?
in
other
words,
if
the
people
can
keep
them
and
they
have
them
there
for
use
in
the
militia
as
well
as
to
hunt
deer,
why
do
we...
why
do
we
have
to
have
a
further
reference
in
there
to
a
right
to
bear
as
well
as
to
keep
arms?
and
my
point
is
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
"keep
and
bear"
forms
one
phrase
rather
than
two.
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
answer
is
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
wait
a
minute.
you're
not
saying
that
if
somebody
goes
hunting
deer
he
is
bearing
arms,
or
are
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
somebody
going
out
to...
in
the
eighteenth
century,
someone
going
out
to
hunt
a
deer
would
have
thought
of
themselves
as
bearing
arms?
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
they
talk?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
"arms"
that
has
the
kind
of
the
military...
the
martial
connotation,
i
would
have
thought.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
want
to
talk
about
the
standard,
and
your
light's
on.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
have
the
first
clause?
i
mean
what
is
it
doing...
i
mean
what
help
is
it
going
to
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any...
is
there
any
record
evidence
that
the
anti-federalist
objections
to
the
constitution
that
ultimately
resulted
in
the
second
amendment
were
premised
on
any
failure
to
recognize
an
individual
right
of
self-defense
or
hunting
or
whatnot,
as
distinct
from
being
premised
on
concern
about
the
power
of
the
national
government
and
the
militia
clauses
in
article
1?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
they
didn't...
they
didn't
limit
it
to
self-defense.
i
mean,
what
provoked
it,
as
i
understand
it,
was
concern
about
the
militia
clauses,
and
here
i
mean
you're
certainly
correct.
i
agree
with
you.
pennsylvania
went
beyond
that.
it
was...
it
was
one
of
three
states,
as
i
understand,
that
did
go
beyond
it.
but
the
provocation
for
getting
into
the
subject,
as
i
understand
it,
was,
in
each
instance
including
pennsylvania,
concern
over
the
national
government's
power
over
militias
under
article
1.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
we
also
look
to
current
conditions
like
current
crime
statistics?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
they
consider
the
extent
of
the
murder
rate
in
washington,
d.c.,
using
handguns?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question
is
whether
they
may
consider
those
statistics,
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think...
i
don't
want
you
to
misunderstand
my
question.
my
question
is
that
by
looking
to
the
statistics,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is
only
sort
of
one
reasonable
response
to
them.
i
want
to
know
whether...
whether
the
policymakers
may
look
to
them;
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
may
be.
i
just
want
to
make
sure
you're
not
making
the
argument
that
because
there
was
not
a
comparable
homicide
rate,
or
for
that
matter,
a
comparable
need
for
self-defense
from
handgun
use
in
1792,
that
there...
1790...
that
therefore,
the
statistics
of
today
may
not
be
considered?
you're
not
making
that
argument?
