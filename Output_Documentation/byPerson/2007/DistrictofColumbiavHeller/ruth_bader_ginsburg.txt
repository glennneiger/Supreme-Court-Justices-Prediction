mr.
dellinger--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--short
of
that,
just
to
get
your
position
clear,
short
of
reactivating
state
militias,
on
your
reading
does
the
second
amendment
have
any
effect
today
as
a
restraint
on
legislation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't,
as
far
as
i
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
there
a
leeway
for
some
weapon
prohibition?
let
me
ask
you,
in
relation
to
the
states
that
do
have
guarantees
of
the
right
to
possess
a
weapon
at
home:
do
some
of
those
states
say
there
are
certain
kinds
of
guns
that
you
can't
have,
like
machine
guns?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
in
interpretation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
means
all.
it
doesn't
mean...
"keep",
on
your
reading,
at
least
if
it's
consistent
with
miller,
keep
and
bear
some
arms,
but
not
all
arms.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we're
going
back
to
the
english
bill
of
rights,
it
was
always
understood
to
be
subject
to
the
control
and
limitation
and
restriction
of
parliament.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
are
legislative
restrictions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i
interrupt
for
a
minute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
about
standards
and
stop
words
like
strict
scrutiny.
does
it
make
a
practical
difference
whether
we
take
your
standard
or
the
strict
scrutiny
that
was
in
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion?
and
specifically
there
is
a
whole
panoply
of
federal
laws
restricting
gun
possession.
would
any
of
them
be
jeopardized
under
your
standard?
and
the
same
question
with
the
district
scrutiny,
does
it
make
any
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
did.
it
said
it's
just
like
the
first
amendment.
first
amendment
has
exceptions,
but
strict
scrutiny
applies.
it
says
strict
scrutiny
applies
here
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
a
limitation?
is
it
any
limitation
on
the
legislature?
is
the
first
clause
any
limitation
on
the
legislature?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
were
thinking
of
17
and
45?
people
who
were
over
45
had
no...
they
didn't
serve
in
the
militia.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
example?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
wouldn't
the
machine
gun
qualify?
general
clement
told
us
that's
standard
issue
in
the
military.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
this
time...
i
would
just
like
to
follow
up
on
what
you
said,
because
if
you
were
right
that
it
was
at
that
time,
yes;
but
that's
not
what
miller
says.
it
says
that
the
gun
in
question
there
was
not
one
that
at
this
time...
this
time,
the
time
of
the
miller
decision...
has
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
preservation
or
efficiency
of
a
well-regulated
militia.
so
it's
talking
about
this
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it's
a
fundamental
right,
what
about
licensing?
one
piece...
we've
talked
about
trigger
locks,
we've
talked
about
the
ban
on
handguns,
but
there
is
also
a
requirement
that
there
be
a
license
for
possession
of
a
handgun.
assuming
you're
right
on
the
first
question,
that
you
couldn't
flatly
ban
handguns,
what
about
a
requirement
that
you
obtain
a
license
to
carry...
to
have
a
handgun?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
this
very
law?
if
you
take
out
the
ban...
there
is
a
law
on
the
books.
it's
one
of
the
ones
that
you
challenged.
it's
section
22-4504(a).
wouldn't
that
be
okay...
would
that
be
okay?
it
says
that
you
have
to
have
a
license
to
carry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
just
says...
it
says
you
have
to
get
a
license
if
you
want
to
possess
a
gun.
what
kind
of
standard?
it
just
says
you
have
to
have
a
license.
