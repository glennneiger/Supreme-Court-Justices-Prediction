your
argument
is
that
its
purpose
was
to
prevent
the
disarming
of
the
organized
militia,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
that
was
the
purpose,
then
how
could
they...
how
could
the
framers
of
the
second
amendment
have
thought
that
it
would
achieve
that
purpose,
because
congress
has
virtually
plenary
power
over
the
militia
under
the
militia
clauses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
even
if
you
have...
even
if
you
have
a
rifle
or
a
shotgun
in
your
home,
doesn't
the
code
prevent
you
from
loading
it
and
unlocking
it
except
when
it's
being
used
for
lawful,
recreational
purposes
within
the
district
of
columbia?
so
even
if
you
have
the
gun,
under
this
code
provision
it
doesn't
seem
as
if
you
could
use
it
for
the
defense
of
your
home.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
amendment
is
intended
at
least,
in
part
to
protect
the
right
to
self-defense
in
the
home,
how
could
the
district
code
provision
survive
under
any
standard
of
review
where
they
totally
ban
the
possession
of
the
type
of
weapon
that's
most
commonly
used
for
self-defense,
and
even
as
to
long
guns
and
shotguns
they
require,
at
least
what
the
code
says
without
adding
a
supposed
gloss
that
might
be
produced
in
a
subsequent
case,
that
even
as
to
long
guns
and
shotguns
they
have
to
be
unloaded
and
disassembled
or
locked
at
all
times,
even
presumably
if
someone
is
breaking
into
the
home?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
anything
to
show
that
the
district
council
ever
considered
the
issue
of
self-defense?
that...
because
they
banned
handguns
and
they
had
this
provision
on
the
trigger
lock
which...
and
the
issue...
my
question
with
the
trigger
lock
doesn't
have
to
do
with
whether
trigger
locks
are
generally
a
good
idea.
it's
whether
you're
ever
allowed
to
take
it
off
for
purposes
of
defense.
there's
no...
is
there
anything
to
show
that
the...
that
the
council
actually
considered
what
sort
of
weapon
is
appropriate
for
self-defense?
