mr.
alan
gura
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
all
50
states
allow
law-abiding
citizens
to
defend
themselves
and
their
families
in
their
homes
with
ordinary
functional
firearms
including
handguns.
now,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
one
point
that
was
raised
lately
by
the
general--
mr.
alan
gura
--okay.
i'd
like
to
respond...
certainly,
justice
scalia.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
the
point
about
the...
the
district
of
columbia's
position
over
the
years
with
respect
to
the
functional
firearms
ban.
the
petitioners
have
had
two
opportunities
to
urge
courts
to
adopt
this
so-called
self-defense
exception
which
they
construed
in
the
amendment.
the
first
opportunity
came
in
1978
in
mcintosh
versus
washington,
where
the
petitioners
urged
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
uphold
the
law
because
it
was
irrational
in
their
view
to
prohibit
self-defense
in
the
home
with
firearms.
they
deemed
it
to
be
too
dangerous,
and
this
was
a
legitimate
policy
choice
of
the
city
council,
and
they
actually
prevailed
in
that
view.
the
second
opportunity
that
the
petitioners
had
to
urge
this
sort
of
self-defense
construction
was
actually
in
this
case
in
the
district
court.
we
had
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
we
made
certain
factual
allegations
in
this
motion,
and
on
page
70a
of
the
joint
appendix
we
see
portions
of
our
statement
of
undisputed
material
facts.
fact
number
29,
which
was
conceded
by
the
district
of
columbia,
reads:
the
defendants
prohibit
the
possession
of
lawfully
owned
firearms
for
self-defense
within
the
home,
even
in
instances
when
self-defense
would
be
lawful
by
other
means
under
district
of
columbia
law.
the
citation
for
that
is
a
functional
firearms
ban,
and
that
point
was
conceded.
certainly
the
idea
that
people
can
guess
as
to
when
it
is
that
they
might
render
the
firearm
operational
is...
is
not
a
one
that
the
court
should
accept,
because
a
person
who
hears
a
noise,
a
person
who
perhaps
is
living
in
a
neighborhood
where
there
has
been
a
spate
of
violent
crimes,
has
no
idea
of
when
the
district
of
columbia
would
permit
her
to
render
the
firearm
operational.
and,
in
fact,
there
is
a
prosecution
history
not
under
this
specific
provision,
but
certainly
other
under
gun
prohibition...
laws
that
we
are
challenging
here
today
to
prosecute
people
for
the
possession
or
for
the
carrying
of
a
prohibited
firearm
even
when
the
police
ruled
the
shooting
has
been
lawful
self-defense,
when
there
is
no
prosecution
for
assault
or
attempted
murder
or
anything
of
that--
mr.
alan
gura
because,
your
honor,
for
the
same
reason
it
was
offered
by
numerous
military
officers
at
the
highest
levels
of
the
u.s.
military
in
all
branches
of
service
writing
in
two
briefs,
they
agree
with
us
that
the
handgun
ban
serves
to
weaken
america's
military
preparedness.
because
when
people
have
handguns...
handguns
are
military
arms,
they
are
not
just
civilian
arms...
they
are
better
prepared
and
able
to
use
them.
and,
certainly,
when
they
join
the
military
forces,
they
are
issued
handguns.
and
so
if
we
assume
that
the
sort
of
military
purpose
to
the
second
amendment
is
an
individual
right,
then
the
handgun
ban,
as
noted
by
our
military
amici,
would
impede
that.
mr.
alan
gura
the
answer
is
yes,
as
justice
scalia
noted,
and
it's
unreasonable,
and
it
actually
fails
any
standard
of
review
that
might
be
offered
under
such
a
construction
of
individual
rights
because
proficiency
with
handguns,
as
recognized
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
by
the
first
circuit
in
cases
back
in
1942...
that
was
a
handgun
case
where
the
first
circuit
examined
the
restriction
on
the
carrying
of
the
30-caliber
revolver.
and
the
first
circuit
accepted,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice,
that
proficiency
in
use
and
familiarity
with
the
handgun
at
issue
would
be
one
that
would
further
a
militia
purpose.
and
so--
mr.
alan
gura
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
gura
yes,
your
honor,
we
must--
mr.
alan
gura
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
militia
clause
informs
the
purpose...
informs
a
purpose.
it
gives
us
some
guidepost
as
to
how
we
look
at
the
second
amendment,
but
it's
not
the
exclusive
purpose
of
the
second
amendment.
certainly,
the
founders
cared
very
much
about--
mr.
alan
gura
--it
is
a
limitation
to
one
extent,
your
honor,
the
extent
recognized
in
miller
where
the
miller
court
asked
whether
or
not
a
particular
type
of
arm
that's
at
issue
is
one
that
people
may
individually
possess.
it
looked
to
the
militia
clause
and,
therefore,
adopted
a
militia
purpose
as
one
of
the
two
prongs
of
miller.
and
so,
certainly,
if
there
were...
if
the
court
were
to
continue
miller...
and
miller
was
the
only
guidance
that
the
lower
court
had,
certainly,
as
to
what
arms
are
protected
or
unprotected
by
the
second
amendment.
and
yet--
mr.
alan
gura
--it
does
not
eliminate
the
kind
of
people,
your
honor,
because
the
second
amendment
is
the
right
of
the
people.
and
it
would
certainly
be
an
odd
right
that
we
would
have
against
the
congress,
if
congress
could
then
redefine
people
out
of
that
right.
congress
could
tomorrow
declare
that
nobody
is
in
a
militia,
and
then
nobody
would
have
the
right
against
the
government.
mr.
alan
gura
well,
certainly,
there
were
many
people
who
were
not
eligible
for
militia
duty,
or
not
subject
to
militia
service,
who
nevertheless
were
expected
to,
and
oftentimes
did,
in
fact,
have
guns.
mr.
alan
gura
well,
we
do
acknowledge
that,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
gura
well,
it
was
a
way
in
which
to
remind
us...
the
framers
certainly
felt
that
a
militia
was
very
important
to
the
preservation
of
liberty.
the
framers
had
just
fought
a
revolutionary
war
that
relied
heavily
on
militia
forces,
and
so
they
wanted
to
honor
that
and
remind
us
as
to
the
purpose...
one
purpose,
not
the
exclusive
purpose,
but
a
purpose...
of
preserving
the
right--
mr.
alan
gura
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
that
view
was
taken
by
william
raleigh
in
his
1828
treatise,
view
of
the
constitution.
raleigh
was,
of
course,
a
ratifier
of
the
second
amendment.
he
sat
in
the
pennsylvania
assembly
in
1790.
and
if
you
look
at
his
description
of
the
second
amendment,
he
bifurcates
it.
first,
he
discusses
the
militia
clause,
and
he
lavishes
some
qualified
praise
on
it.
and
then--
mr.
alan
gura
--oh,
yes.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
was
derived
from
blackstone.
it
was
derived
from
the
common-law
english
right
which
the
founders
wanted
to
expand.
in
fact,
the
chapter
in
which
blackstone
discusses
this
in
his
treatise,
his
fifth
auxiliary
right
to
arms,
is
entitled--
mr.
alan
gura
--well,
certainly
they
saw--
mr.
alan
gura
--well,
my
response
is
that
the
government
can
ban
arms
that
are
not
appropriate
for
civilian
use.
there
is
no
question
of
that.
mr.
alan
gura
that
are
not
appropriate
to
civilian
use.
mr.
alan
gura
for
example,
i
think
machine
guns:
it's
difficult
to
imagine
a
construction
of
miller,
or
a
construction
of
the
lower
court's
opinion,
that
would
sanction
machine
guns
or
the
plastic,
undetectable
handguns
that
the
solicitor
general
spoke
of.
the
fact
is
that
this
court's
miller
test
was
the
only
guidance
that
we
had
below,
and
i
think
it
was
applied
faithfully.
once
a
weapon
is,
first
of
all,
an
"arm"
under
the
dictionary
definition...
and
webster
has
a
very
useful
one...
then
you
look
to
see
whether
it's
an
arm
that
is
meant
to
be
protected
under
the
second
amendment,
and
we
apply
the
two-pronged
miller
test.
and
usually
one
would
imagine
if
an
arm
fails
the
miller
test
because
it's
not
appropriate
for
common
civilian
applications--
mr.
alan
gura
--but
it's
not
an
arm
of
the
type
that
people
might
be
expected
to
possess
commonly
in
ordinary
use.
that's
the
other
aspect
of
miller.
miller
spoke
about
the
militia
as
encompassing
the
notion
that
people
would
bring
with
them
arms
of
the
kind
in
common
use
supplied
by
themselves.
and--
mr.
alan
gura
--that's
correct.
the
time
frame
that
the
court
must
address
is
always
the
present.
the
framers
wished
to
preserve
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
they
wished
to
preserve
the
ability
of
people
to
act
as
militia,
and
so
there
was
certainly
no
plan
for,
say,
a
technical
obsolescence.
however,
the
fact
is
that
miller
spoke
very
strongly
about
the
fact
that
people
were
expected
to
bring
arms
supplied
by
themselves
of
the
kind
in
common
use
at
the
time.
so
if
in
this
time
people
do
not
have,
or
are
not
recognized
by
any
court
to
have,
a
common
application
for,
say,
a
machine
gun
or
a
rocket
launcher
or
some
other
sort
of--
mr.
alan
gura
--at
the
time
that...
even
at
the
time
miller
was
decided,
the
civilian
arms
were
pretty
much
the
sort
that
were
used
in
the
military.
however,
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
a
machine
gun
could
be
a
d.c.
circuit's
wording,
of
anything
that
existed
back
in
1791,
if
we
want
to
look
to
the
framing
era.
machine
guns--
mr.
alan
gura
--your
honor,
even
within
the
militia
understanding,
the
understanding
of
the
militia
was
always
that
people
would
bring
whatever
they
had
with
them
in
civilian
life.
so
if
a
machine
gun,
even
though
it
may
be
a
wonderful--
mr.
alan
gura
--it's
only
of
relevance
if
the
court
wishes
to
continue
reading
the
militia
clause
as
informing
the
type
of
weapon
which
is
protected.
mr.
alan
gura
i
agree
with
your
honor,
and
certainly
in
our
brief
we
suggest
that
the
militia
emphasis
of
miller
is
not
useful
as
a
limiting
principle
to
the
type
of
arms
that
may
be...
that
may
be
permitted.
because,
on
the
one
hand,
there's
a
great
deal
of
weaponry
that
might
be
wonderful
for
military
duty
but
is
not
appropriate
for
common
civilian
use,
which
would
not
be
protected
even
under
the
miller
test's
first
prong.
and,
on
the
other
hand,
everything
that
civilians
today
might
wish
to
have
in
ordinary
common
use...
handguns,
rifles,
and
shotguns...
are
militarily
useful
weapons.
so
we
de-emphasize
the
military
aspects
of
miller
as
being
ultimately
not
very
useful
guidance
for
courts.
and
the
better
guidance
would
be
to
emphasize
the
commonsense
rule
that
i
think
judges
would
have
really
no
trouble
applying,
and
we
do
this
all
the
time
in
constitutional
law:
to
simply
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
whichever
arm
comes
up
at
issue
is
an
arm
of
the
kind
that
you
could
really
reasonably
expect
civilians
to
have.
mr.
alan
gura
the
legislature
has
a
great
deal
of
leeway
in
regulating
firearms.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
however,
i
wouldn't
draw
a
complete
analogy
between
the
boston
fire
ordinances
that
your
honor
notes
and
the
functional
firearms
ban.
first,
even
the
boston
firearms
ordinances
did
not
include
handguns
actually.
at
the
time
the
word
"firearm"
was
not
understood
to
include
pistols.
general
gage's
inventory
of
weapons
seized
from
the
americans
in
boston
included
some
1800
or
so
firearms
and
then
634
pistols.
nowhere
in
the
boston
code
do
we
see
a
prohibition
on
keeping
loaded
pistols
in
the
home.
and
certainly
the
idea
that...
that
self-defense
is
a
harm
is
one
that
is--
mr.
alan
gura
--well,
back
to
your
honor's
first
question,
we
don't
agree
that
the
military
purpose
is
the
exclusive
purpose
of
the
second
amendment.
and
we
also
don't
agree
that
it
could
be
a
reasonable
regulation
or
under
any
standard
of
review
to
prohibit
people
from
having
functional
firearms
in
their
own
home
for
purposes
of
self-defense.
mr.
alan
gura
well,
originally
it
was
not.
but
what
we've
seen
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we've
seen--
mr.
alan
gura
--1783
i
believe
was
the
statute.
mr.
alan
gura
your
honor,
the
state
courts
interpreting
those
provisions
that
you
reference
had
a
different
interpretation.
for
example,
in
1895
massachusetts--
mr.
alan
gura
--well,
at
the
time
we
haven't
seen
state
court
decisions
from
exactly
that
era.
mr.
alan
gura
on
their
literal
text,
yes.
but
judges
did
not
interpret
them
that
way,
for
example
in
north
carolina--
mr.
alan
gura
--while
it
might
not
mention
self-defense,
it
was
clear
that
the
demands
that
the
states
made
at
the
ratifying
conventions
were
for
an
individual
right,
and
madison
was
interested
in--
mr.
alan
gura
--it
was
in
england,
but
that
was
criticized
by
the
framers.
st.
george
tucker's
edition
of
blackstone--
mr.
alan
gura
--it's
quite
clearly
an
expansion
upon
it.
mr.
alan
gura
i
think
the
common
law
of
england
is
a
guide,
and
it's
always
a
useful
guide
because
that's
where
the...
where
we...
where
we
look
to,
to
interpret--
mr.
alan
gura
--it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
and
it's
also
useful
to
see
how--
mr.
alan
gura
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
gura
yes,
justice
souter.
if
we
look
to,
for
example,
the...
the
demands
of
the
pennsylvania
minority,
the
anti-federalists
there
were
extremely
influential.
they
couched
their
demands
in
unmistakably
self-defense
terms.
in
fact,
they
added
a
provision--
mr.
alan
gura
--justice
souter,
we
wouldn't
see
the
history
that
way.
certainly
there
is
agreement
that
the
militia
clauses
in
the
constitution
were
controversial.
and
there
were
separate
amendments
that
were
proposed
and
always
rejected
that
would
have
addressed
that
explicitly.
in
fact,
if
we
look
at
virginia's
proposals,
it's
agreed
by
the
petitioners
that
virginia
was
the
model
for
the
bill
of
rights
and
specifically,
of
course,
for
the
second
amendment.
we
saw
one
set
of
proposed
amendments
from
virginia
entitled
bill
of
rights,
and
the
second
amendment
language
comes
from
paragraph
17
of
that
bill
of
rights.
and
then
we
see
a
list
of
other
amendments,
and
then
we
have
the
11th
proposed
amendment,
which
speaks
exactly
to
the...
reverting
control
over
the
militia
back
to
the...
back
to
the
states.
now,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
virginia
would
have
made
the
same
demand
twice,
that
they
would
have,
like
all
the
other
demands,
it
had
separate
"keep
and
bear
arms"
provisions
and
separate
militia
provisions,
that
people
were
being
duplicative
for
no
reason.
the
fact
is
that
the
militia
concerns
were
heard
and
they
were
voted
down,
and
the
second
amendment
concerns
were
the
ones
that
the
federalists
were
easily
agreeable
to
because
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
by
individuals
was
not
controversial,
it
would
not
have
altered
the
structure
of
our
constitution,
and
so
those
were
agreed
to
quite
readily.
mr.
alan
gura
well,
it's
not
similar
because
the
modern
trigger-lock
provisions
are
aimed
squarely
at
self-defense
in
the
home.
there
is
no
risk
today
that
the
kind
of
powder
we
use--
mr.
alan
gura
--oddly
enough,
a
child
can
access
a
firearm
stored
consistently
with
the
district's
law,
that
is,
a
firearm
which
is
disassembled
and
unloaded,
nothing
would
prevent
a
child--
mr.
alan
gura
--that's
true,
your
honor.
however,
better
safe
storage
approach
is
the
one
used
by
the
majority
of
jurisdictions,
i
believe,
that
do
have
such
laws,
which
is
to
require
safe
storage,
for
example,
in
a
safe.
and
that
is
a
reasonable
limitation.
it's
a
strict
scrutiny
limitation.
whatever
standard
of
view
we
may
wish
to
apply,
i
think,
would
encompass
a
safe
storage
provision.
but
this
is
not
a
safe
storage
provision
because
we
have
specific
exceptions
that
allow
you
to
actually
use
the
firearm
in
recreational
shooting
and
also
in
a
place
of
business.
and
we
have
litigation
history
from
washington,
d.c.,
that
tells
us
that
we
are
not
supposed
to
have
an
operable
firearm
for
purposes
of
self-defense
because
they
simply
do
not
trust
people
to
defend
themselves
in
our
home.
and...
and
self-defense
is
the
heart
of
the
second
amendment
right.
that
is
what
blackstone
was
getting
at
when
he
spoke
of
the
fifth
auxiliary
right
to
arms,
because
it
protected
the
right
of
personal
preservation.
mr.
alan
gura
which
provisions
were
those,
justice
stevens?
mr.
alan
gura
well,
pennsylvania's
provision
was
certainly
influential.
remember,
madison
was
trying
to
mollify
the
anti-federalists'
concerns.
the
second
amendment
is
clearly
addressed
to
pennsylvania
and
new
hampshire
and
new
york
and
all
these
other
states
that
were
demanding
a
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms,
and
there
was
always
understood
to
be
an
individual
right
because
that
is
the
way
in
which
the
right
that
was
violated
by
the
british
in
the
war
of
revolution
that
occurred
not
too
long
ago.
and...
i'm
finished.
mr.
alan
gura
when
a
fundamental
right
is
at
stake,
there
is
a
role
for
judicial
review,
your
honor.
we
are
not
going
to
see
a
thousand
judges
review
such
laws
because
washington,
d.c.'s
is
the
only
example
of
it.
mr.
alan
gura
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
depend
on
the
licensing
law
itself.
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
the
concept
of
licensing
so
long
as
it's
done--
mr.
alan
gura
--so
long
as
the
licensing
law
is
not
enforced
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner,
so
long
as
there
are
some
hopefully
objective
standards
and
hopefully
some
process
for--
mr.
alan
gura
--well,
the
government
could
set
reasonable
standards
for
that,
your
honor.
the
government
could
require,
for
example,
knowledge
of
the
state's
use
of
force
laws.
they
can
require
some
sort
of
vision
test.
they
could
require,
perhaps,
demonstrated
competency.
and
those
are
the
types
of
things
that
we
sometimes
see;
background
checks,
of
course.
those
are
going
to
be
reasonable
licensing
requirements.
however,
if
the
license
requirement
is
we
only
wanted
to
give
licenses
to
people
who
look
a
certain
way
or
depends
on
how
we
feel
or
if
the
licensing
office
is
only
open
thursdays
at
3:00
in
the
morning...
i
mean,
it
all
depends
on
the
implementation.
and--
mr.
alan
gura
--well,
certainly
the
age-of-majority
issue
is...
is
an
appropriate
one.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
problem
with
requiring
a
majority
age
18
and
then
21
for--
mr.
alan
gura
--courts
would
have
to
examine
those
at
some
point.
the
government
would
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
it
confronted
and
enact,
up
to
some
point,
an
age
limit.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
have
an
age
limit
that
goes
beyond
21,
because
that's
the
majority
age
for
most
things
in
the
united
states.
and,
in
fact,
we
have
the
voting
rights
cases
from
the
late
'60s
where--
mr.
alan
gura
--there
is
that
inherent
aspect
to
every
right
in
the
constitution.
mr.
alan
gura
well,
yes,
your
honor,
to
some
extent,
except
the
word
"unreasonable"
is
the
one
that
troubles
us
because
we
don't
know
what
this
unreasonable
standard
looks
like.
mr.
alan
gura
that's
another
way
to
look
at
it,
your
honor.
certainly--
mr.
alan
gura
--those
restrictions--
mr.
alan
gura
--framing
our
practices
would
inform
the
kind
of
restrictions
that
would
be
accepted.
but
even
beyond
that,
they
also
inform
the
contours
of
the
right.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
for
example,
we
have
the
emerson
decision
now
for
seven
years,
and
the
way
that
that
court
has
examined
the
second
amendment
when
they
get
these
felon
and
possession
bans
and
drug
addict
and
possession
challenges,
what
they
say
is,
these
people
simply
are
outside
the
right,
as
historically
understood
in
our
country.
and
that's
a
very
important
aspect
to
remember,
that
the
second
amendment
is
part
of
our
common
law
tradition,
and
we
look
to
framing
our
practices
in
traditional
understandings
of
that
right
to
see
both
the
reasonableness
of
the
restrictions
that
are
available
as
well
as
the
contours.
mr.
alan
gura
to
some
extent,
your
honor,
but
we
have
certainly--
mr.
alan
gura
--if
we
were
to
consider
the
extent
of
the
murder
rate
with
handguns,
the
law
would
not
survive
any
type
of
review,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
gura
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
gura
well,
those
statistics
might
be
considered
in
some
way,
the
fact
is
that
at
some
point
there
is
a
role
for
judicial
review.
and
you
can't
just
grab
at
statistics...
and
some
of
the
statistics
that
were
used
here
are
very
weak,
and
studies
that
have
been
rejected
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences
repeatedly.
i
mean,
we
don't
really
have...
it's
hard
to
say
that
those
laws--
mr.
alan
gura
--to
some
degree,
yes,
policymakers
have
to
be
informed
by
what's
going
on
in
order
to
make
policy.
however,
there
are
constitutional
limitations
enforced
by
courts
that
are
going
to
limit
those
policies.
and
when
you
have
a
ban
which
bans
40
percent
of
all
weapons
that
are
the
type
of
weapons
used
by
civilians,
80
percent
of
all
self-defense
occurs
with
handguns;
when
you
have
that
kind
of
ban,
functional
firearms
ban,
these
are
extreme
measures--
mr.
alan
gura
--no,
your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
we
can
always
debate
these
things,
but
the
object
of
the
bill
of
rights
is
to
remove
certain
judgments
from
the
legislature,
because
we
can
make
policy
arguments,
normative
arguments
about
many
provisions
of
the
constitution.
but
to
make
those
arguments
and
say,
well,
we've
decided
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
no
longer
a
good
idea
and,
therefore,
we
are
going
to
have
restrictions
that
violate
that
stricture
in
the
bill
of
rights,
that
shouldn't
pass
judicial
review.
at
some
point
you
have
to
go
to
article
5
if
you
think
that
the
constitution
is
impractical.
mr.
alan
gura
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
gura
certainly
that
creates
some
sort
of
an
evidentiary
record.
conceivably
that--
mr.
alan
gura
--we
would
have
to
do--
mr.
alan
gura
--some
fact
finding.
it's
something
that
might
be
doable,
but
again,
that's
so
far
from
what
we
have
here.
we
have
here
a
ban
on
all
guns,
for
all
people,
in
all
homes,
at
all
times
in
the
nation's
capital.
that
quite
simply
is
too
broad
and
too
sweeping
under
any
level
of
review.
thank
you,
your
honor.
