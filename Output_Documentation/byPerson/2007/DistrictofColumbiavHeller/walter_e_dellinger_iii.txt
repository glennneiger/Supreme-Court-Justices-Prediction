mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
amendment
was
a
direct
response
to
concern
over
article
i,
section
8
of
the
constitution,
which
gave
the
new
national
congress
the
surprising,
perhaps
even
the
shocking,
power
to
organize,
arm,
and
presumably
disarm
the
state
militias.
what
is
at
issue
this
morning
is
the
scope
and
nature
of
the
individual
right
protected
by
the
resulting
amendment
and
the
first
text
to
consider
is
the
phrase
protecting
a
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
in
the
debates
over
the
second
amendment,
every
person
who
used
the
phrase
"bear
arms"
used
it
to
refer
to
the
use
of
arms
in
connection
with
militia
service
and
when
madison
introduced
the
amendment
in
the
first
congress,
he
exactly
equated
the
phrase
"bearing
arms"
with,
quote,
"rendering
military
service".
we
know
this
from
the
inclusion
in
his
draft
of
a
clause
exempting
those
with
religious
scruples.
his
clause
says
"the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed,
a
well
armed
and
well
regulated
militia
being
the
best
security
of
a
free
country,
but
no
person
religiously
scrupulous
of
bearing
arms
shall
be
compelled
to
render
military
service
in
person.
"
and
even
if
the
language
of
keeping
and
bearing
arms
were
ambiguous,
the
amendment's
first
clause
confirms
that
the
right
is
militia-related.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
the
phrase
"the
people"
and
the
phrase
"the
militia"
were
really
in...
in
sync
with
each
other.
you
will
see
references
in
the
debates
of,
the
federalist
farmer
uses
the
phrase
"the
people
are
the
militia,
the
militia
are
the
people.
"
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
i
do
believe
it
includes
all
the
people
in
the
sense
of
verdugo-urquidez,
all
those
who
are
part
of
the
polity.
what...
what
defines
the
amendment
is
the
scope
and
nature
of
the
right
that
the
people
have.
it's,
it
is
a
right
to
participate
in
the
common
defense
and
you
have
a
right
invocable
in
court
if
a
federal
regulation
interferes
with
your
right
to
train
for
or
whatever
the
militia
has
established.
so
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
kennedy,
i
think
any
interpretation
that
delinks
the
two
clauses
as
if
they
were
dealing
with
related
but
nonetheless
different
subject
matters
has
that
to
count
against
it,
and
what
you
don't
see
in
the
debates
over
the
second
amendment
are
references
to,
in
those
debates,
the
use
of
weapons
for
personal
purposes.
what
you
see
is
the
clause
that,
that
literally
transposes
to
this:
"because
a
well
regulated
militia
is
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be--
"
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think,
as
this
court
unanimously
held
in
miller,
or
at
least
noted
in
miller...
i'll
leave
aside
the
debate.
the
court
unanimously
said
in
miller
that
the
second
amendment
must
be
interpreted
in
light
of
its
obvious
purpose
to
ensure
the
continuation
and
render
possible
the
effectiveness
of
the
military
forces.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
but
once
you
assume
that
the
clause
is
designed
to
protect
the
militia,
it...
surely
it's
the
militia
that
decides
whether
personal
possession
is
necessary.
i
mean,
miller...
what
makes
no
sense
is
for
miller
to
require
the
arm
to
be
militia-related
if
the
right
is
not,
and
the
key
phrase
is
"bear
arms".
if
people--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
i
think--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
second
clause,
the
phrase
"keep
and
bear
arms",
when
"bear
arms"
is
referred
to...
is
referred
to
in
a
military
context,
that
is
so
that
even
if
you
left
aside--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
not
the
discourse
that
is
part
of
the
second
amendment.
and
when
you
read
the
debates,
the
congressional
debates,
the
only
use
of
the
phrase
"keep
and
bear
arms"
is
a
military
phrase,
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--when
blackstone
speaks
of
the
personal
guarantee,
he
describes
it
as
one
of
the
use
of
weapons,
a
common
law
right.
and
if
we're
constitutionalizing
the
blackstonian
common
law
right,
he
speaks
of
a
right
that
is
subject
to
due
restrictions
and
applies
to,
quote
"such
weapons,
such
as
are
allowed
by
law.
"
so
blackstone
builds
in
the
kind
of
reasonableness
of
the
regulation
that
the
district
of
columbia
has.
now,
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
don't
dispute,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
second
amendment
is
positive
law
that
a
litigant
can
invoke
in
court
if
a
state
were
to
decide
after
recent
events
that
it
couldn't
rely
upon
the
federal
government
in
natural
disasters
and
wanted
to
have
a
state-only
militia
and
wanted
to
have
everybody
trained
in
the
use
of
a
weapon,
a
federal
law
that
interfered
with
that
would
be
a
law
that
could
be
challenged
in
court
by,
by
an
individual.
i
mean,
i
think
the
better--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
would,
justice
ginsburg,
if
the
state
had
a
militia
and
had
attributes
of
the
militia
contrary
to
a
federal
law.
and
if
it
didn't--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--as
far
as
i
know,
today
it
doesn't.
and
i'm
not...
and
the
respondents
make
that,
that
argument
that
the
amendment
is
without
a
use.
but
you
don't
make
up
a
new
use
for
an
amendment
whose
prohibitions
aren't
being
violated.
i
mean--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
because,
i
think,
justice
alito,
that
those
who
wanted
to
retake
state
authority
over
the
militia
didn't
get
everything
they
wanted.
madison
actually
did
this
somewhat
reluctantly
and
wanted
to
maintain
national
control.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
but
if...
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
the
federal
government
could
abolish
the
state
militia.
it
may
be
presupposed
by
the
article
i,
section
8,
clauses
15
and
16,
and
by
the
second
amendment
that
the
states
may
have
a
militia.
that
issue
has
been
left
open
as
to
whether
you
could
do
that,
and
it
can
be
called
into
federal
service
but
only
in
particular
circumstances.
now
i
think
the
better
argument
for
the
other
side,
if,
if
there
is
to
be
a
militia
relatedness
aspect
of
the
second
amendment,
as
we
think
clear
from
all
of
its
terms,
then
heller's
proposed
use
of
a
handgun
has
no
connection
of
any
kind
to
the
preservation
or
efficiency
of
a
militia
and
therefore
the
case
is
over.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
the,
the
question
exactly,
but--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
debate
over
the
militia
clause...
what
is
shocking
about
the
militia
clauses
is
that
this
is
a,
a
new
national
government
that
for
the
first
time
has
the
power
to
create
a
standing
army
of
professionals.
the
militia
were
people
who
came
from
the
people
themselves,
put
down
their
weapons
of
trade.
the
states
were
devoted
to
the
ides
of
their
militia
of
volunteers,
and
of
all
the
powers
granted
to
the
federal
government
one
of
the
most
surprising
was
to
say
that
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
organize,
arm,
and
discipline
the
militia
and
to...
even
though
the
officers
could
be
appointed
by
the
state,
the
discipline
had
to
be
according
to
congress.
and
this
was...
this
caused
a
tremendous
negative
reaction
to
the
proposed
constitution.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
restricted
in
our
view
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
to
interfere
with
the
arming
of
the
militia
by
the
states.
and
the
word
that
caused
the
most
focus
was
to
"arm"
and
that
is
to
disarm.
now,
what
i
think
is
happening
is
that
two
different
rights
are
being
put
together.
one
was
a
textual
right
to
protect
the
militia.
i
think
the
better
argument
for
the...
for
the
other
side,
for
mr.
heller,
is
that
the
amendment's
purpose
is
militia
protective,
but
it
was
overinclusive
in
the
way
that
several
of
you
have
suggested,
and
that
is
that,
as
the
court
below
said,
preserving
the
individual
right,
presumably
to
have
guns
for
personal
use,
was
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
the
militia
could
serve
when
called.
but
that
right,
this
right
of
personal
liberty,
the
blackstonian
right,
is
an
unregulated
right
to
whatever
arm,
wherever
kept,
however
you
want
to
store
it,
and
for
the
purposes
an
individual
decides,
that
is
a
libertarian
ideal.
it's
not
the
text
of
the
second
amendment,
which
is
expressly
about
the
security
of
the
state;
it's
about
well-regulated
militias,
not
unregulated
individual
license,
as
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
and
if
the
court--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
they
are
highly
relevant
to
your
inquiry
because
now
42
states
have
adopted
constitutional
provisions.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
you're
talking
about
at
the
time.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
that
the...
the
state
amendments
are
generally
written
in
different...
in
different
terms.
if
you're
going
to
protect
the
kind
of
right
that
is...
that
is
being
spoken
of
here,
different
from
the
militia
right,
the
plain
language
to
do
it
would
be
"congress
or
the
states
shall
pass
no
law
abridging
the
right
of
any
person
to
possess
weapons
for
personal
use.
"
and
that's
not
the
right
that
is
created
here.
one
of
the
troublesome
aspects
of
viewing
this
as
a
right
of
personal
use
is
that
that
is
the
kind
of
fundamental
liberty
interest
that
would
create
a
real
potential
for
disruption.
once
you
unmoor
it
from...
or
untether
it
from
its
connection
to
the
protection
of
the
state
militia,
you
have
the
kind
of
right
that
could
easily
be
restrictions
on
state
and
local
governments
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
it
doesn't
address
the
same
subject
matter
as
the
english
bill
of
rights.
i
think
it's
related
to
the
use
of
weapons
as
part
of
the
civic
duty
of
participating
in
the
common
defense,
and
it's...
and
it's...
it's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that...
that
could
well...
the
answer
then
would
be--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--parliament
could
regulate.
and
blackstone
appears
to
approve
of
precisely
the
kinds
of
regulations
here.
now--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--this
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
that
is...
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
the
different
kind
of
right
that
you're
talking
about,
to
take
this
to
the
question
of...
of
what
the
standard
ought
to
be
for
applying
this,
even
if
this
extended
beyond
a
militia-based
right,
if
it
did,
it
sounds
more
like
the
part
of
an
expansive
public
or
personal...
an
expansive
personal
liberty
right,
and
if
it...
if
it
is,
i
think
you
ought
to
consider
the
effect
on
the
42
states
who
have
been
getting
along
fine
with
state
constitutional
provisions
that
do
expressly
protect
an
individual
right
of...
of
weapons
for
personal
use,
but
in
those
states,
they
have
adopted
a
reasonableness
standard
that
has
allowed
them
to
sustain
sensible
regulation
of
dangerous
weapons.
and
if
you--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--what
is
reasonable
about
a
total
ban
on
possession
is
that
it's
a
ban
only
an
the
possession
of
one
kind
of
weapon,
of
handguns,
that's
been
considered
especially...
especially
dangerous.
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
it's
not,
and
the
difference
is
quite
clear.
if...
if
you...
there
is
no
limit
to
the
public
discourse.
if
there
is
an
individual
right
to
guns
for
personal
use,
it's
to
carry
out
a
purpose,
like
protecting
the
home.
you
could
not,
for
example,
say
that
no
one
may
have
more
than
50
books.
but
a
law
that
said
no
one
may
possess
more
than
50
guns
would...
would
in
fact
be
i
think
quite
reasonable.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct
because
there
is
no
showing
in
this
case
that
rifles
and
handguns
are
not
fully
satisfactory
to
carry
out
the
purposes.
and
what...
and
what
the
court
below
says
about...
about
the
elimination
of
this--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
i'm
sorry.
rifles
and
handguns.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
purpose...
if
the
purpose...
if
we
are
shifting
and
if
we
assume
for
a
moment
arguendo
that
you
believe
this
is
a
right
unconnected
to
the
militia,
then
the
purpose
would
be,
say,
defense
of
the
home.
and
where
the
government
here,
where
the...
where
the
correct
standard
has
been
applied,
which
is
where
a
state
or
the
district
has
carefully
balanced
the
considerations
of
gun
ownership
and
public
safety,
has
eliminated
one
weapon,
the
court
below
has
an
absolutist
standard
that
cannot
be
sustained.
the
court
below
says
that
once
it
is
determined
that
handguns
are,
quote,
"arms",
unquote,
referred
to
in
the
second
amendment,
it
is
not
open
to
the
district
to
ban
them.
and
that
doesn't
promote
the
security
of
a
free
state.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
and
here
what
the
opinion
below
would
do
instead...
would...
it's
hard
to
see
on
the
opinion
below
why
machine
guns
or
armor-piercing
bullets
or
other
dangerous
weapons
wouldn't
be
categorically
protected--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--in
those
states--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
it's
not
in
the
text
of
the
state
constitutional
provision;
it's
in
their--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--reasonable
application.
and
here,
the
question
is
how
has
the
balance
been
struck?
the
district
allows
law-abiding
citizens
to
have
functioning
firearms
in
the
home.
from
the
time
it
was
introduced
in
1976,
it
has
been
the
consistent
position
that
you're
entitled
to
have
a
functioning
firearm.
at
issue
is
the
one
type
of
weapon--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
number
of
machine
guns,
i
believe,
is
in
excess
of
a
hundred
thousand
that
are
out
there
now,
that
are--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
there
are
300
million,
but
whether
that's
common
or
not,
but
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--but
it's
the...
the
court
protects
weapons
suitable
for
military
use
that
are
lineal
descendants.
i
don't
know
why
an
improved
bullet
wouldn't
be
covered,
unless
you
adopt
the
kind
of
reasonableness
standard
that
we
suggest,
where
you
look
to
the
fact
that...
and
i
don't...
some
people
think
machine
guns
are
more
dangerous
than
handguns...
they
shoot
a
lot
of
people
at
once...
but
a
handgun
is
concealable
and
movable.
it
can
be
taken
into
schools,
into
buses,
into
government
office
buildings,
and
that
is
the
particular
danger
it
poses
in
a
densely
populated
urban
area.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
let
me
fight
back
on
the
notion
that
it's
a...
it's
a
total
ban.
it's
not
as
if
every
kind
of
weapon
is
useful.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
you
can...
you
can
with
a
proper
license.
the
district
has
made
it
clear
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
interprets
its
laws
to
allow
a
functioning
gun.
and
to
say
that
something
is
a
total
ban
when
you
own
only
one
particular
kind
of
weapon
would
apply
to
a
machine
gun
if
it
were
or
came
into
common
use
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
not
the
city's
position,
and
we
have
no
dispute
with
the
other
side
on
the
point
of
what
the
right
answer
should
be.
it
is
a
universal
or
near
universal
rule
of
criminal
law
that
there
is
a
self-defense
exception.
it
goes
without
saying.
we
have
no
argument
whatsoever
with
the
notion
that
you
may
load
and
have
a
weapon
ready
when
you
need
to
use
it
for
self-defense.
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it's
a
reasonable
regulation
for
two
kinds
of
reasons.
first,
in
order...
the
amendment
speaks
of
a
well-regulated
militia.
perhaps
it's
the
case
that
having
everybody
have
whatever
gun
they
want
of
whatever
kind
would
advance
a
well-regulated
militia,
but
perhaps
not.
but,
in
any
event--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--when
you...
when
you
have
one--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
every...
every
phrase
of
the
amendment,
like
"well
regulated",
"security
of
the
state",
is
something
different
than
a...
a
libertarian
right.
here
you
have,
i
think,
a
fully...
on
this,
particularly
on
a
facial
challenge,
there
is
no
showing
that
rifles
and
shotguns
are
not
fully
available
for
all
of
the
purposes
of
defense.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
district
militia
is
an
entity
that
needs
individuals
to
have
their
own
handguns.
you...
you...
there
is
a
step
that
is...
that
is
missing
here.
the
well-regulated
militia
is
not
necessarily
about
everyone
having
a
gun.
a
militia
may
decide
to
organize...
be
organized
that
way,
in
which
case
you
would
have
a
different
notion.
but
here,
i
think,
when
you
come
down
to
apply
this
case,
if
you
look
at
about
five
factors,
that
other
weapons
are
allowed,
important
regulatory
interests
of
these
particularly
dangerous
weapons
are...
is
clearly
a
significant
regulatory,
and
important
regulatory,
interest.
in
two
respects
this
is
removed
from
the
core
of
the
amendment.
even
if
it
is
not
limited
to
militia
service,
even
in
the
court
below,
no
one
doubts
that
that
was,
as
the
court
below
said,
the
most
salient
objective.
so
this
is
in
the
penumbra
or
the
periphery,
not
the
core.
it
was
undoubtedly
aimed
principally,
if
not
exclusively,
at
national
legislation
which
displaced
the
laws
in
all
of
the
states,
rural
as
well
as
urban.
here
you've
got
local
legislation
responsive
to
local
needs,
and
this
is
local
legislation
in
the
seat
of
the
government
where
congress,
which
was
created
in
order
to
protect
the
security
of
the
national
government,
and
where
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
assume
that
this
is
the
one
place
that
you're
not
going
to
incorporate
it,
the
one
area
in
the
united
states
where
no
government,
free
of
restrictions
of
the
second
amendment,
could
control
dangerous
weapons.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
am
sure
he
was
influenced
by
that,
although
i
think,
honestly--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
address
first
why
this
law
is
reasonable
and
should
be
sustained,
and
why
the
judgement
below
has
to
be
reversed,
however,
whatever
position
you
take
on
the
theories
of
the
amendment.
and
in
defending
the
eminent
reasonableness
and
careful
balance
of
this
law,
i
need
to
start
with
the
trigger
law,
about
which
justice
alito
asked.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
those
are
alternatives,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
just
a
trigger
lock.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there
are
some
versions
of
the
trigger
lock
that
allow
you
to
put
the
trigger
lock
on
and
then
load
the
gun.
but
the
piece
that
goes
in
the
trigger
mechanism,
even
someone
as
clumsy
as
i
could
remove
it
in
a
second--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--you
know,
it's
a
question
of
where
you
put
the
parenthesis.
i
read
that
as
disassembled
and
unloaded
or
under
a
trigger
lock,
and
that's
the,
that's
the
way
the
district--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--you...
you
place
a
trigger
lock
on
and
it
has...
the
version
i
have,
a
few...
you
can
buy
them
at
17th
street
hardware...
has
a
code,
like
a
three-digit
code.
you
turn
to
the
code
and
you
pull
it
apart.
that's
all
it
takes.
even...
it
took
me
3
seconds.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
you
can
have
one
with
a
numerical
code.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
let
me
tell
you.
that's
right.
let
me
tell
you
why
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
doesn't...
this
doesn't
matter,
for
two
reasons.
the
lesson--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
took
me
3
seconds.
i'm
not
kidding.
it's...
it's
not
that
difficult
to
do
it.
that
was
in
daylight.
the
other
version
is
just
a
loop
that
goes
through
the
chamber
with
a
simple
key.
you
have
the
key
and
put
it
together.
now,
of
course
if
you're
going...
if
you
want
to
have
your
weapon
loaded
and
assembled,
that's
a
different
matter.
but
here's
where
i
want
to
address
the
trigger
lock.
here's
why
it
doesn't
matter
for
the
handgun
law.
the
district
believes
that
what
is
important
here
is
the
ban
on
handguns.
and
it
also
believes
that
you're
entitled
to
have
a
functional,
usable
weapon
for
self-defense
in
the
home,
and
that's
why
this
is
a
very
proportionate
law.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
is...
there
has
been
no
showing
here
that
a
rifle
or
a
shotgun
is
inadequate
for
the
purposes
of
self-defense
in
this
facial
challenge.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there
are
decisions
in
the
district
of
columbia
about
the
right
of
self-defense
that
apply
to
this.
but
here's
the
most
important
point.
it
cannot
affect
the
validity
of
the
handgun
law.
if
you
disagree
with
us
that
my
statements
are
not
sufficient
to
say
that
we
believe
that
the
law
should
be
read,
given
the
self-defense
compulsion,
to
allow
whatever
use
makes
it
functional,
if
you
don't
agree
with
that
and
if
you
think
there's
a
controversy
on
this
point,
because
we
believe
you
should
have
a
functional
firearm
available
in
the
home
of
law-abiding
citizens
who
wish
one,
if
we
are
wrong
about
that
and
the
trigger
lock
is
invalid,
that
has
no
effect
on
the
handgun
ban.
that
is
to
say,
the
trigger
lock
applies
to
all
weapons.
if
it's
valid
and
it
means
what
they
say
it
does,
none
of
the
weapons
would
work.
we
don't
need
a
handgun;
it's
unusable.
if
it's
invalid
or
if
it
has
the
construction
we
believe,
it
cannot
possibly
affect
the
handgun
law.
if
you
strike
down
the
trigger
lock
law,
you're
throwing
us
in
the
briar
patch
where
we
think
it's
where
we're
happy
to
be
if
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
make
clear
in
the
trigger
lock
law
what
we
have
said
here
today,
that
it's,
it's
available
for
self-defense.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
only
applies
if
it's...
if
it's
unregistered.
now,
you
can't
register
a
handgun,
you
can't
carry
a
handgun,
but
that's
because
its
both...
its
possession
is
prohibited.
that
is
to
say
you
can't
carry
marijuana
or
heroin
from
one
room
to
the
other
either,
because
you
can't
use
it
at
all,
i
think.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
it's...
it's...
the
carry
provision,
you
cannot
carry
unregistered
firearms.
that's
just
a
general
requirement,
that
firearms
be
registered.
you're
not
allowed
to
register
handguns
is
the
mechanism
by
which
they
are
prohibited.
now,
here
is...
to
address
your
question
about
why
a
ban
is
unreasonable,
the
one
thing
we
know
the
second
amendment
is
not
about
is
it's
not
about
the
interest
of
collectors.
some
people
collect
guns
the
way
they
do
stamps,
and
if
that
were
what
the
amendment
were
about
then
prohibiting
someone
from
having
a
particular
type
of
gun
would
prevent
them
from
completing
the
set.
but
the
notion--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
the
word
"keep"
would
encompass...
"keep"
can
encompass
every
use
of
an
arm,
and
that's
why
it
provides
no
limit
at
all,
unless
you
read
it
in
combination
with
"keep
and
bear"
and
that
in
combination
with
"well-regulated
militia".
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--of
course
you
could
do
that.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
and
like
the
district
that
allows
that,
as
every
state
does.
there
are--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
do
not
know
why
that
would
pass
the
reasonableness
scrutiny,
but
this
law
would
because
a
powerful,
overwhelming
case
could
be
made
that
you're
eliminating
the
one
type
of
weapon...
this
law
is...
is
designed
only
for
the
weapon
that
is
concealable
and
movable,
that
can
be
taken
into
schools
and
onto
the
metro,
can
be
easily
stolen
and
transmitted
among--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--you
would
apply
this
standard.
you
would
ask
whether
the
ban
is
one
that's
carefully
balanced
considerations
of
gun
ownership
and
public
safety.
i
don't
see
how,
once
we
are
in
the
land
where
you...
where
there
is
a
right,
there
is
a
far
weaker
case
if
there
is
any
need
for
public
safety
to...
to
limit
the
number
of
guns
one
has.
here
there
is
an
overwhelming
case
and
we
are
talking
about
local
legislation.
i
know,
justice
kennedy,
that
you
would
be
concerned
about
a
national
government
which
sets
a
single
standard
for
rural
and
urban
areas,
for
east
and
west,
north
and
south.
here
you
have
legislation
that
is
adopted
by
a
group
of
citizens
in
the
district,
operating
under
the
authority
of
congress,
but
it
is
local
legislation.
and
if
it's
still
good
law,
that
states
and
local
governments
across
the
country
can
strike
these
balances,
as
they
have,
it
would
be
deeply
ironic
to
preclude
the
district
of
columbia
as
being
the
only
place
that
could
enact
legislation
free
of
the
strictures
of
the
second
amendment.
and
when
you
ask
about
the
statistics,
what
is
critical
here
is
not
to
apply
the
kind
of
categorical
standard
the
court
below
did
or
a
kind
of
strict
scrutiny
that
would
strike
this
law
down.
this
is
an
area,
unlike
areas
where
government
regulation
is
presumptively
illegitimate,
this
text
contemplates
regulation
of
inherently
dangerous
weapons.
and
where
the
battle...
the
great
battle
over
methodology,
to
which
justice
breyer
replied,
in
these
briefs...
indicates
that
this
is
the
kind
of
right...
where
you
have
disputes
among
experts,
it's
a
kind
of
right
where
even
if
you
recognize
it,
deference
needs
to
be
given
to
the
legislative
resolution
rather
than
have
courts
try
to
decide
how
best
to
resolve
the
statistical
and
methodological
debates.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
