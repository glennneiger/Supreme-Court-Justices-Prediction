chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-210,
bridge
versus
phoenix
bond
&
indemnity.
mr.
becker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
all
the
shell
corporations
still
bidding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
becker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
debruin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what...
would
your
position
be
different
if
the
county
were,
in
fact,
injured;
we
didn't
have
the
zero-percent
situation
but
different
percentages?
your
client
would
not
be
able
to
sue
them,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
does
that
do
to
your
statutory
argument?
in
other
words
under
your
statutory
argument,
you
still
could
sue;
but
because
of
other
considerations
you
can't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
happens...
what
happens
if
some
of
the
bids
were
more
than
zero,
and
some
weren't?
you
get
to
sue
for
part
of
the
damages,
and
the
county
gets
to
sue
for
the
rest?
or
how
do
you
divvy
that
up?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
suppose
since
we
are
talking
about
a
rotational
rule,
you
could
have...
what
are
these,
monthly
or
annually...
one,
possibly,
cycle
where
it's
all
zero
percent,
and
then
others
where
it
isn't,
and
then
another
where
it
is.
and
that
would
affect
the
rotation
in
a
way
that
would
injure
your
client
but
would
also
injure
the
county.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
that
every
other
bidder
in
this
situation
is
a
viable
plaintiff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
in
other
cases
where
if
we
adopt
the
rule
you
argue
for,
that
wouldn't
be
confined
at
all.
for
example,
in
a
situation
where
a
competitor
is
defrauding
a
supplier,
every
competitor
no
matter
how
many
there
were,
could
bring
a
rico
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
regardless
of
how
many
competitors
there
are?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
debruin.
mr.
miller?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
with
respect
to
federal
government
contracts,
can
disappointed
bidders
sue
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
if
there
are
50
disappointed
bidders?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
becker,
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
