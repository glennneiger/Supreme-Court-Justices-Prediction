mr.
theodore
m.
becker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
both
parts
of
the
question
presented
in
this
case
should
be
answered
"yes".
for
a
treble
damage
civil
rico
claim
based
on
fraud,
someone
must
rely
on
the
alleged
misrepresentation,
and
that
someone
must
be
the
plaintiff.
but
that's
the
very
nature
of
a
fraud
claim.
plaintiffs
here
claim
that
they
were
injured
by
reason
of
a
rico
violation,
the
predicate
acts
of
which
involved
a
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud.
but
no
one
in
this
case
is
arguing
that
a
civil
rico
claim
based
on
fraud
can
proceed
without
someone
relying.
so
some
reliance
is
required;
the
only
question
is
who
must
rely?
and
we
submit
that
the
natural
answer
is
the
plaintiff.
a
plaintiff
who
hasn't
relied
to
his
detriment
on
an
alleged
misrepresentation
hasn't
been
defrauded;
he
hasn't
been
injured
by
reason
of
a
scheme
to
defraud.
plaintiffs
here
haven't
alleged
that
they
relied
on
any
misrepresentation;
they
haven't
even
alleged
that
they
received
a
misrepresentation.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
there
would
be
a
criminal
rico
prosecution
because,
under
the
neder
case,
we
know
that
reliance,
justifiable
reliance,
and
injury
is
not
required.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
justice
scalia,
those
cases
as
well
as
the
rice
versus
manley
new
york
case,
the
cheese
buyer's
case,
similar
situation,
do
exist,
but
they
are
really
tortious
interference
with
business
expectancy
cases.
and
we
believe
that
the
law
makes
that
clear.
when
rico
was
enacted
in
1970,
the
law
even
in
new
york,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
had
evolved
to
the
extent
where...
where
there
were
some
references
to
fraud
in
those
early
cases
in
the
19th
century.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
mail
fraud
statutes.
but
i
will
say,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
government's
position
here
seeks
to
extend
the
mail
fraud
statute
far
beyond
what
this
court
did
in
neder.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
made
the
exact
same
argument
in
neder
as
it
did
to
this
court,
and
the
court--
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
--i
think
that
in
criminal
mail
fraud,
reliance
is
not
required,
justice
kennedy.
and
that's
what
the
neder
court
held.
but
in
doing
so,
it
looked
to
the
common
law
and
imposed
a
materiality
requirement.
and
the
only
reason
that
the
neder
case
ruled
that
it's
not
required
in
criminal
mail
fraud
is
because
no
one
has
to
be
injured;
there
does
not
have
to
be
a
completed
scheme.
civil...
there
is,
of
course,
no
private
right
of
action
in
mail
fraud.
and
when
we
look
to
whether
or
not
someone
has
a
civil
claim
under
rico
through
the
predicate
act
of
mail
fraud,
we
have
to
go
through
1964(c),
the
"injured
by
reason
of"
requirement.
as
this
court
found
in
holmes,
the
common-law
requirement
of
proximate
cause
applies,
we
submit
so
does
the
common-law
element
of
reliance,
justifiable
reliance,
apply
in
a
civil
rico
case
predicated
on
mail
fraud.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
well,
justice
souter,
of
course,
in
holmes
the
court
was
looking
at
the
"injured
by
reason
of"
language
and
looked
to
the
clayton
act
and
looked
to
the
sherman
act
before
it,
where
congress
used
precisely
the
same
language.
certainly
rico
doesn't
have
proximate
cause
in
its
text
at
all.
the
reason...
the
very
reason
that
the
common
law
does
apply
when
you
are
construing
a
mail
fraud
predicate
act
through
a
civil
rico
claim
is
because
congress
has
not
told
us
what
"defraud"
means.
it
has
not
defined
"scheme
to
defraud",
and
of
course
that's--
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
--because
in
other
cases
where
this
court
has
looked
at
the
same
type
of
situation,
the
neder
case,
field
versus
mans,
for
example,
where
there
is
not
a
definition
of
a
term
such
as
fraud,
the
court
has
looked
to
the
common
law
to
define
that
term.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
except,
justice
souter,
that
the...
the
requirement
that
there
need
to
be
an
indictable
offense
is
not
enough
to
make
out
a
civil
fraud
because
criminal
law
recognizes
a...
an
uncompleted
fraud,
simply
a
scheme,
where
here,
if
you're
talking
about
a
completed
fraud,
for
someone
to
be
injured
by
reason
of
a
fraud,
it
has
to
be
completed
and
someone
has
had
to
rely
on
it.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
i...
we...
we
believe
it
does.
if
your
honor
will
contrast
the
salinas
case
with
the
beck
versus
prupis
case,
we
believe
it's
the
similar--
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
--all
right.
i
will.
in
the
salinas
case,
which
was
a
criminal
rico
case,
the
court
ruled
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
a
wrongful
overt
act
in
order
to
make
out
a
criminal
cause
of
action
for
conspiracy
under
the
rico
statute.
and
the
reason
was
because
all
you
need
is
the
agreement
and
any
acts.
this
was
a
situation
where
a
sheriff
actually
was
the
wrongdoer,
but
the
deputy
sheriff
took
some
innocent
acts
that
were
in
furtherance
of
conspiracy.
the
court
said
that's
conspiracy.
however,
in
the
beck
versus
prupis
case,
the
court
said
that
for
civil
rico
cause
of
action
based
on
conspiracy,
you
need
to
look
at
the
combination
between
1964(c),
the
"injured
by
reason
of"
language,
and
the
actual
statutory
language.
and
since
conspiracy
is
not
defined
in
the
rico
statute,
the
court
looked
to
the
common
law,
and
the
common
law
requires
that
there
needs
to
be
an
unlawful
overt
act
or
tortious
act
in
order
to
make
out
a
common-law
cause
of
action
for
conspiracy.
and
the
court
ruled
that
that
was
necessary.
we
think
it's
the
exact
same
relationship
salinas
is
to
beck
as
neder
is
to
this
case.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
because
no
representation
has
been
made
to
the
plaintiff,
and
the
plaintiff
hasn't
relied
on
the
misrepresentation
that
was
made
to
the
county.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
without
the
misrepresentation
to
the
county,
justice
kennedy?
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
well,
i
think
this--
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
--we
think
it's
necessary,
your
honor.
the
other
aspect,
of
course,
in
the
hypothetical
is
that
there
needs
to
be
some
direct
injury,
and
we
don't
believe
that
a
direct
injury
is
presented
here.
in
order
to...
in
anza
and,
of
course,
before
in
holmes,
the
court
set
forth
three
basic
guidelines
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
was
sufficient
proximate
cause
to
bring
a
cause
of
action
under
civil
rico,
and
in
anza
under
mail
fraud.
we
don't
think
those
three
are
enough
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
well,
justice
souter,
first,
we
disagree
that
the
rotational
allocation
is
well
pled
fact.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
toward
the
last
several
pages
and
in
footnote
7,
the
actual
sale
and
the
bidding
is
nothing
like
the
concept
of
rotational
allocations.
but
putting
that
aside
for
a
moment,
the
county
certainly
could
be
a
victim.
first
of
all,
the
county...
this
is
a
violation
of
an
administrative
rule.
that's
what
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case,
an
alleged
violation.
the
county
has
made
the
rule
possibly
for
the
purpose
that
your
honor
just
articulated,
although
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
let
us
know
that.
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
these
types
of
rules
exist
for
the
benefit
of
the
property
owners,
and
that's
because
the
illinois
supreme
court
in...
the
same
plaintiff
brought
a
case
challenging
a
very,
very
similar
rule.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
justice
souter,
zero
percent
is
by
no
means
guaranteed.
that's
only
been
the
last
few
years.
in
fact,
in
the
2000
case
before
the
illinois
supreme
court--
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
--including
the
bidders
and
the
plaintiffs,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
well,
i
think
that
they
certainly
could
not
prove
injury
as
a
matter
of
proof.
the
problem
with
that,
of
course,
is
in
a
rico
case
it
takes
five
years
to
get
there.
and
someone
can
artfully
plead...
use
two
words
with
no
elaboration
at
all,
"rotational
allocation".
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
that's
correct,
justice.
we...
we
are...
we
have
raised
below,
but
not
in
this
court,
that
there
was
not
sufficient
injury,
directness
of
injury;
and
it
can't
be
proved
in
this
court.
i
think
it
comes
into
play
in
the
reliance
concept
under
proximate
causation.
and
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
recognize
that,
in
the
context
of
a
civil
rico
claim
based
on
fraud,
that
there
is...
there
is
nothing
that
is...
that
is
revolutionary
about
finding
that
a
reliance
requirement
should
be
applied.
this
case,
as
the
court
knows,
was
originally
dismissed
by
chief
judge
holderman
on
that
very
basis.
if
we
have...
if
we
were
to
accept...
if
the
court
were
to
accept
our
opponents'
position,
a
remarkable
array
of
lawsuits
could
be
brought
as
rico
actions:
competitor
versus
competitor
for
harm
that
allegedly
is
caused
by
false
statements
to
customers,
suppliers,
distributors,
marketing
agencies,
government
entities;
consumer
or
end
user
versus
manufacturer
for
harm
allegedly
resulting
from
false
statements
to
the
first
buyer
in
a
distribution
chain.
and
the
circuit
court
cases
in
the
fifth...
fourth
and
fifth
and
sixth
and
eighth
and
eleventh
circuits
have
recognized
this,
and
they
require
reliance
as
a
part
of
proximate
causation,
and
we
believe
this
court
should
do
the
same.
i
also
wanted
to
make
the
point
that
to
elaborate,
in
the
neder
case,
the
government...
and
this
is
a
case
where
the
government
ostensibly
argues
that
it
wants
us
not
to
restrict
civil
rico
claims.
but
in
the
neder
case
the
government
made
the
very
same
argument
in
trying
to
expand
mail
fraud
claims
under
the
criminal
statutes.
and
i
think
that's...
that's
a
sub
rosa
issue
in
this
case.
the
court
nine
years
ago
specifically
said
in
a
unanimous
opinion,
with
chief
justice
rehnquist
writing
for
the
court,
that
the
court
disagreed
that
mail
fraud
was
moored
to
the
common
law
of
fraud,
and
it
is
not
unmoored
in
the
neder
case.
they
said
it
was
moored,
and
even
in
a
criminal
prosecution
materiality
is
required.
and
although
justifiable
reliance
and
injury
is
not
required
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
to
unmoor
the
mail
fraud
statute
in
a
civil
rico
context
and
to
then
make
the
argument
that
all
sorts
of
other
claims
can...
can
also
be
included
such
as
tortious
interference...
because
at
its
heart
this
is
a
tortious
interference
case.
we
know
that
because
the
plaintiffs
pled
it
in
their
complaint.
that's
their
pendant
state
court
action.
and
that's
where
this
case
should
be.
it
should
be
a
tortious
interference
case.
if
they
can
prove
that
case
and
if
they
have
pled
it,
then
they
have
a
remedy.
if
they
can't,
they
don't.
but
the
problem
is
that
to
give
the
civil
rico
tool,
to
call
"racketeers"...
to
call
your
competitor
a
"racketeer"
and
to
seek
treble
damages
and
attorney's
fees
in
this
kind
of
such
an
attenuated
situation,
should
not
be
something
that
the
court
condones.
and
it's
different;
if
you
google
my
clients,
you'll
come
up...
they
will
come
up
as
racketeers
now,
and...
and
that's
the
problem
that
we
have.
if
there
were
a
reliance
requirement,
you
could
immediately
tell
if
this
was
a
situation
where
the
common
law--
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
--well,
i
didn't
concede
that
my
client
would
be
indictable
for
mail
fraud.
i
think
that
there
would
have
to
be...
we'd
have
to
take
a
careful
look
at
the
indictment,
certainly.
but
i
will
say
that...
that
i
do...
i
do
say
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
does
not
require
justifiable
reliance
or
injury.
i
think
the
problem
is
when
you
ask
the
direct...
my
client
hasn't
been
indicted
for
mail
fraud,
and
i
don't
think
it's
any...
it's
any
oversight
because
this
has
been
a
very
well
known
case
in
cook
county.
i
think
the
reason,
if
one
were
to
ask
me
why
my
client
hasn't
been
indicted
for
mail
fraud,
is
because
they
didn't
commit
it,
because
the
county
in
its
own
rule...
the
treasurer
wrote
the
rule
and
expressly
says
in
the
rule
that
she
has
the
exclusive
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
rule.
she
has
not
so
determined.
and
this
case
has
been
pending
now
for
close
to
over
three
years.
the
treasurer
is
aware
of
it,
and
we
know
that,
and
she
still
has
not
determined
that
there
has
been
a
violation.
so
if
there
hasn't
been
a
violation
of
the
rule,
there
is
no
criminal
mail
fraud
violation
either.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
yes,
justice
souter,
and
also
all
of
the...
al
of
the
plaintiffs...
the
respondents
are
still
bidding,
which
i
think
is
an
interesting
fact.
and
it's
not...
it's
in
the
record
because
they
have
an
amended
complaint
where
they
have
pled
subsequent
sales.
that's
how
far
afield
from
the
law
of
fraud
this
is
going.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
mr.
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
if
all
of
them
aren't,
it's
simply
because
there
may
be
new
corporations
that
are,
and
they
are
formed
not
for
the
purpose
of
defrauding
anybody,
but
for
tax
purposes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd...
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
thank
you.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
what
congress
intended
is
that,
yes,
in
the
comments
to
the
enactment
of
rico,
congress
did
say
that
it
was
trying
to
protect
legitimate
competitors
from
illegitimate
conduct
or
unlawful
conduct.
this
case
has
now
morphed
into
a
situation
where
competitors
are
using
rico
as
an
anticompetitive
device,
and
that's
what
we
believe
the
reliance
requirement
will...
will
at
least
rein
in,
totally
consistent
with
the
common
law.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
impose
any
requirement
on
rico
that
does
not
already
exist
by
reason
of
the
common-law
meaning
rule.
actually,
we
believe
our
opponents
and
the
s.g.
are
asking
this
court
to
expand
rico
by
unmooring
it
from
the
common
law.
we
believe
that
beck
versus
prubis
is
exactly
the
same
situation
and
the
same
analysis.
although
1962(d),
which
is
a
substantive
conspiracy
violation
of
rico,
was
at
issue
in
beck
versus
prupis,
you
get
to
the
same
situation
just
as
an
extra
step.
here's
the...
here's
the
analysis.
you
look
to
19...
they
have
a
conspiracy
count
of
course.
but
you
look
to
1962(c),
and
it
says
that
"any
person
injured
by
reason
of.
"
--if
you
read
in
1964(c)
to
it...
by
reason
of
a
rico
violation
or
a...
or
a
racketeering
activity
"shall
have
a
cause
of
action.
"
now,
you
look
to
racketeering
activity
in
1961,
and
that
has
a
hundred
and
something
predicate
acts,
one
of
which
is
mail
fraud.
you
look
at
mail
fraud,
and
it
says
"a
scheme
to
defraud".
it
uses
the
word
"defraud".
what
does
that
mean?
it's
the
same
place;
you
just...
you
just
need
to
take
one
more
step
to
get
there,
but
it's
the
same
place
the
court
found
itself,
we
submit,
in
beck
versus
prupis.
if
criminal
conspiracy
means
the
same
thing
as
civil
conspiracy,
beck
versus
prupis
would
not...
the
court
would
not
have
held
what
it
did
in
beck
versus
prupis.
and
if
mail
fraud
only
means
an
indictable
offense
and
nothing
more
under
the
criminal
law,
it
should
be
the
same
as
the
civil
law,
then
there
would
be
no
common-law
meaning
rule.
to
apply
the
common-law--
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
--justice
souter,
we
respectfully
disagree
and
refer
the
court
to
field
versus
mans,
where
it
was
bankruptcy
fraud.
and
i
believe...
the
exact
same
thing.
what
does
bankruptcy
mean?
what
does
mail
fraud
mean?
well,
they
looked
to...
the
court
looked
to
the
common
law
meaning
rule,
and
looked
to
the
elements
you
need
for
fraud
in
order
to
determine
what
has
to
be
proved
for
bankruptcy
fraud.
mr.
theodore
m.
becker
not
from
the
statute
we
don't,
justice
souter.
there
is
no
definition
of
mail
fraud
in
the
statute.
the
only
reason
we
know
what
it
means
is
because
the
court
has
construed
it
over
the
years.
in
order
to
construe
it
now
in
a
civil
context,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
common
law
meaning
rule
because
that's...
the
analog
is
fraud;
that's
the
obvious
source
to
look
to
the
common
law.
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
make
a
few
other
points.
first
of
all,
i
cannot
leave
this
podium
and
leave
this
court
under
the
impression
that
there
is
directness
of
injury.
there
are
195
bidders.
the
plaintiffs
themselves
alleged
this
in
paragraph
46,
our
joint
appendix
20
and
21.
without
belaboring
it,
the
last
few
pages
of
our
reply
brief
show
all
of
the
things
that
would
have
to
be
shown
in
order
to
have
even...
even
a
remote
directness
of
injury
in
this
case.
so
the...
we
have
not...
we
have
not
in
any
way
conceded
that
the
requirements
of
anza
or
holmes
have
been
met.
and...
but
i
think
our
brief
adequately
deals
with
that.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
rico
and
mail
fraud
don't
reach
everything
actionable
at
common
law.
i
mean,
if
there
was
an
argument,
that
would
mean
that
civil
rico
in
every
case
involving
a
false
statement...
every
case
involving
a
false
statement,
no
matter
to
whom
it's
made,
would
be
a
civil
rico
case.
the
general
idea
of
protecting
competitors
doesn't
mean
that
congress
provided
that
anything
that
anyone
says
to
anybody
violates
civil
rico.
that's
not
the
way
that
this
court
interprets
statutes;
and
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
at
all
as...
that
the
rotational
basis
applies
only
when
bids
are
at
zero
percent.
in
the
year
2000
the
illinois
supreme
court
confronted
the
same
plaintiff
in
this
case,
phoenix
bond,
challenging
a
very
similar
rule
because
at
that
point
in
time
there
was
collusion
including
the
same
plaintiff
to
keep
the
penalty
rate
at
18
percent.
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
the
rule
will...
is
something
that
the
treasurer
has
the
right
to
make
to
try
to
regulate
the
bids,
and
the
treasurer
certainly
can
be
a
victim
of
this
situation.
if
the
bid
is
not
perceived
as
fair,
the
treasurer
will
not
have
enough
bidders
in
order
to
sell
all
the
bids,
and
therefore,
the
county
will
not
be
paid
the
unpaid
taxes.
if
the
treasurer
thought
that
there
really
was
a
misrepresentation
here
made
by
the
petitioners,
the
treasurer
would
have
a
very
great
incentive
and
a
very
great
state
in
enforcing
this
rule;
and
the
treasurer
did
not,
we
believe
because
the
treasurer
doesn't
believe
there
is
any
violation.
the...
the
other
ways
that
the
county
could
be
injured
are
that
if
the...
if
the
penalty
rate
goes
up
beyond
zero
percent,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
same
number
of
bidders
will...
will
come
to
the
sale.
there...
i
also
want
to
refer
the
court
to
other...
this
is
not
new.
in
safeco
insurance
just
recently,
last
term,
the
court
asked...
was
asked
to
define
the
term
"willfulness"
in
a
civil
liability
provision
of
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
and
the
court
observed
that
there
is
different
meanings
in
the
civil
and
criminal
law
to
the
term
"willfulness".
in
farmer
versus
brennan
the
court
recognized
different
uses
of
the
term
"recklessness"
in
the
civil
and
criminal
contexts.
so
once
again
we
are
asking
this
court
to
rule
consistent
with
the
common
law
meaning
rule
that
the...
a
civil
rico
action
predicated
on
mail
fraud,
where
one
is...
it
has
to
fulfill
the
requirement
that
you
have
been...
the
plaintiff
has
been
injured
by
reason
of
mail
fraud
or
racketeering
activity.
the
plaintiff
must
rely
on
a
misrepresentation
or
the
fraud
directly,
because
that's
the
essence
of
civil
fraud.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
