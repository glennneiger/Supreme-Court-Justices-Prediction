suppose
in
a
tortious
interference
case,
the
two
tort...
there
are
two
tort
feasors,
and
they
communicate
with
each
other
by
mail.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
mail
fraud
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
my...
in
my
hypothetical,
there
was
no...
there
was
no
reliance
on
anything
said.
it
was
just
used
to
facilitate
the
scheme.
and
i
assume
the
plaintiff
could
recover.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
without
the
mail
fraud
violation...
let's
assume...
the
tort
would
have
been
unsuccessful.
it
would
not
have
been
complete.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
let's
assume
that.
and
it
was
directed
at
this
class
of
persons
and
it
was
relied
upon
by
the
county.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
certainly
sufficient
under
the...
it's
a
mail
fraud
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
refer
to
the
mail...
the
civil
rico
refers
to
whether
it's
a
mail
fraud
violation.
you
want
to
assume
this
additional
reliance
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
it
your
view
that
assume...
assuming
there
is
a
state
law
cause
of
action
for
tortuous
interference,
that
if
that
tortious
interference
was
effected
through
the
use
of
the
mails
by
the
co-tort
features,
that
that
automatically
invokes
the
rico
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
that
there
are
predicate
acts,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
the
law
generally
in
the
states
that
an
unsuccessful
bidder
can
sue
the
successful
bidder
if
the
successful
bidder
misstated
qualification?
