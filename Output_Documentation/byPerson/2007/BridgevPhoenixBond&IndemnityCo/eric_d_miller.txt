mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
rico
provides
a
cause
of
action
to
plaintiffs
who
have
suffered
injuries
by
reason
of,
that
is,
proximately
caused
by,
a
rico
violation.
now,
when
the
rico
violation
is
predicated
on
an
act
of
mail
fraud,
the
plaintiff
ordinarily
will
need
to
show
that
somebody
relied
on
the
false
statements
in
order
to
establish
that
the
fraud
was
even
a
"but
for"
cause
of
injury.
a
plaintiff
who
can
establish
that
it
was
the
one
who
relied
on
the
false
statements
would
be
able
to
show
proximate
causation.
but
that's
not
the
only
way
to
establish
proximate
causation,
and
there
is
no
basis
for
this...
for
the
imposition
of
a
per
se
rule
requiring
that
the
plaintiff
be
the
one
who
has
relied.
instead
when
a
defendant
creates
a
scheme
to
defraud
that
induces
reliance
by
one
party
in
order
to
injure
another
party,
the
injured
party
should
have
a
cause
of
action
under--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--my
understanding
is
that
the
case
has
established
that
they
can.
again,
since
this
came
up
after
the
briefing,
one
illustrative
example
is
in
the
eighth
circuit,
iconco
against
jensen
construction
company,
which
is
622
f.
2d
1291.
in
that
case,
it
was
a
contract
that
was
set
aside
for
small
businesses,
and
the
company
got
the
contract
by
falsely
claiming
to
be
a
small
business.
and
then
in
a
diversity
case
applying
iowa
law,
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
the
disappointed
bidder
could
bring
an
action
for
fraud
and
unjust
enrichment
against
the
successful
bidder.
so
i
think
that...
and
that's
of
a
piece
with
the
long
common-law
tradition,
going
back
to
cases
like
rice
against
manley,
where--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
it
would
be
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
to
establish
that,
but
for
the
fraud,
it
would
have
gotten
the
contract.
so
in
most
cases
of
contracting,
that's
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
a
plaintiff
to
show.
this--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--is
somewhat
usual.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
no,
the
participants
in
the
lottery
in
that
case
would
have
a
cause
of
action
because
they
have
paid
money
to
the
person
running
the
lottery.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think...
i
think
the...
the
common-law
measure
of
damages
would
be...
would
be
what
they
paid
in
that
situation.
but
certainly
the
recovery
for
disappointed
bidders
in
cases
like
this,
does
have
a
long
common-law
tradition,
and
with
the
more
modern
elaboration
of
tort
law,
as
demonstrated
by
the
secondary
statement,
it
has
sometimes
been
given
a
different
label,
and
that
is
either
"injurious
falsehood"
or
"intentional
interference
with
a
prospective
contractual
relation.
"
but
at
its
heart,
the
action
that's
at
issue
here
is
one
that's
for
fraud.
but
i
would
like
to
say
in
response
to
some
of
justice
alito's
questions
that,
with
respect
to
the
beck
case
and
the
relevance
of
it,
that
ultimately
in
our
view
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
the
common
law
would
have
allowed
recovery
in
this
case,
and
that's
because,
unlike
in
beck
where
the
court
had
to
consider
what
is
the
meaning
of...
what
does
it
mean
to
be
injured
by
reason
of
a
conspiracy?
and
the
court
answered
that
question
by
looking
at
the
common
law
of
civil
conspiracy.
that
mode
of
analysis
would
be
appropriate
here
if
the
relevant
predicate
under
1961
were
fraud
or
any
conduct
involving
fraud
or
otherwise
made
reference
to
common-law
fraud.
but,
of
course,
1961
does
not
say
that;
it
says
"any
act
which
is
indictable
under
section
1341.
"
the
mail
fraud
statute.
so
under...
given
the
structure
of
the
statute,
the
only
inquiry
is:
is
the
injury
incurred
by
reason
of
an
act
which
is
indictable
under
1341?
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
1964(c)
refers
you,
as
you
noted,
to
1962,
which
simply
says
"conspiracy".
and
so
the
court
in
beck
explained
that
to
figure
out
how
you
tell
when
someone
has
been
injured
by
civil
conspiracy,
there
is
a
body
of
law,
the
common
law,
that
answers
that
question.
there
is
no
corresponding
common-law
principle
of
what
it
means
to
be
injured
by
an
act
of
mail
fraud
because
there
is
no
common
law
of
mail
fraud
per
se;
it's
a
statutory
creation.
and
so
the
relevant
inquiry
is
simply:
did
the
conduct
violate
the
mail
fraud
statute,
section
1341?
not
was
it
common
law
fraud?
mr.
eric
d.
miller
no.
i
think
that's
right.
and
certainly
the
1964,
it
does
refer
to
the
common-law
requirements
of
proximate
cause.
but
that...
that
language...
1961.
and
in
the
context
of
many
of
those
acts,
reliance
would
be
completely
inappropriate.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
i
think
the
conduct
that
is
alleged
here
really
does
go
to
the
core
of
what
rico
is
intended
to
redress.
congress
made
clear,
in
the
finding
that
accompanied
the
statute,
that
one
of
its
principal
concerns
was
that
criminal
enterprises
could
use
illegal
means
to
compete
unfairly
with
legitimate
businesses.
and
so
if
a
business...
a
criminal
business
were
to
use
threats
of
violence
directed
at
its
competitor's
customers
to
get
them
to
switch
their
business
to
it,
the
competitor
would
have
a
cause
of
action
for
that.
and
then
the
same
should
be
true,
we
submit,
if
the
business
uses
fraud
directed
at
its
competitor's
customers
to
induce
them
to
switch
their
business.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
