justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
about
a
case,
say,
you've
got
organized
crime
wants
to
get
rid
of...
an
organized
crime
enterprise
wants
to
get
rid
of
rivals,
so
it
makes
misrepresentations
about
those
rivals
to
customers
and
suppliers,
not
to
the...
to
the
rival.
so
there
was
no...
there
is
no
misrepresentation
made
to
the
plaintiff
but
to
the
plaintiff's
customers
and
suppliers.
so
on
your
theory,
is
there
no
rico
claim
because
the
misrepresentation
was
made
to
someone
other
than
the
plaintiff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
no
civil
case
in
that...
in
that
situation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
isn't
it...
there
is
reliance
on
their
allegations
by
the
county.
the
county
thinks
that
each
bidder
is
putting
in
only
one
bid.
so
the
county
has
been
deceived,
and
the
plaintiff
suffers
the
effect
of
that
deception.
why
doesn't
that
qualify?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that's
a
different
point,
the
point
that
you
made
in
your
reply
brief,
that
maybe
there
isn't
this
rotational
system,
and
maybe
they
can't
prove
that
they
were...
that
they
were
injured;
that
they
would
have
gotten
a
greater
share.
but
your
case
is
about...
it
doesn't
matter
even
if
you...
you
have
to
accept
the
allegations
of
their
complaint
as
true,
even
if
everything
they
say
in
the
complaint
is
true,
they
have
no
claim.
they
have
no
rico
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
have
to
assume
what
they
say
about
the
rotational
system
is
right
and...
but...
but
you
are
hanging
your
hat
on
no
misrepresentation
was
made
to
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
go
back
to
a
statement
you
made?
i
thought
you...
you
conceded
that
on
their
allegations
your
client
would
be
indictable
for
mail
fraud?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those...
those
weren't
mailed,
or
at
least
that's
not
what
you're
relying
on.
you're
not
relying
on
the
affidavits
that
make
the
misrepresentation
using
the
mails.
i
thought
your
reliance
on
the
mails
is
only
the
tail
end
of
this
transaction,
the
notices
that
get
sent
to
the
property
owners.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
becker
says
they
were
interference
with
a
business
relationship,
not
fraud.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
concern,
because
rico
can
be
a
very
broad
statute,
is
that
if
you
are
right,
then
any
unsuccessful
bidder
could
look
through
a
rival's
submission,
find
a
false
statement,
and
sue
under
rico.
