justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
isn't
the
difference
that,
in
holmes,
it
was
the
textual
basis
"by
reason
of"
through
which
the...
as
we
read
it...
the
proximate
cause
standard
was...
was
brought
into
the
statute.
here,
in
fact,
there...
there
isn't
any
text,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you
can...
can
rely
on.
the
fact
of
fraud
itself
doesn't
do
it
because
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
an
offense
for
which
an
individual
should
be
prosecuted.
so
it's
looking
to
the
criminal
rather
than
the
civil
model.
and
isn't
that
the
distinction,
in
effect,
a
textual
distinction,
between
holmes
as
a
means
for
importing
proximate
cause
and
the
statute
in
this
case
as
a
means
for
importing
first-party
reliance?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
hasn't
it
done
so
simply
or
sufficiently
done
so
by
referring
to
the...
in
effect...
the
criminal
mail
fraud
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we
didn't
have...
i
don't
think
we
had
in
those
cases
the
phrase
that
occurs
here.
i
think
the
phrase
here
is
"could
be
prosecuted
or
indicted"
for
something...
i
think
it
was
prosecution...
which
tends
to
narrow
it
down
to
the
criminal
model,
rather
than
allowing
us
to
roam
into
the
civil
field.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
well,
that
means
that
to
that
extent
the
criminal...
in
effect...
the
criminal
cause
of
action
is
narrowed
down.
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
the
statute
contemplated
adopting
a
civil
model
regardless.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
going
to
have
to
help
me
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
isn't
the
problem
with
your
argument
that
if
this
isn't
direct
enough,
there
is
no
injury
at
all?
the
county
isn't
hurt
by
this.
the
county
has
got
its
rotational
scheme
basically
to
avoid
favoring
particular
bidders
who
appear
in
multiple
guises,
but
the
county
isn't
getting
hurt.
so
that
if
it's
not
direct
enough
for...
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
to
sue,
then
nobody
has
a
direct
enough
interest
or
can
show
direct
enough
causation
for
rico.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
could
the
property
owner
be
hurt
if
there
is...
if
we
are
dealing
in
a
situation
here
in...
in
which
the
penalty
is
zero
percent,
and
everybody
is
bidding
zero
percent,
then
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
property
owner
isn't
going
to
get
hurt
no
matter
who
ends
up
with
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
the...
that's
the
case
here.
so
if
your
direct-injury
requirement,
as
you
construe
it,
applies
here,
i
think
we
are
still
left
with
a
situation
in
which
on
these
facts,
nobody
would
be
injured,
because
nobody...
or
nobody
would
be...
be
able
to
prove
injury
by
a
sufficient
direct
route
to
establish
causation.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
your
client
still
bidding
on...
on
these--
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't...
isn't
the
weakness
of
the
argument
that
you're,
in
effect,
dividing
mail
and
fraud?
you're
saying
there
are
two
requirements,
and
therefore,
fraud
here
is
just
like
conspiracy
in
beck.
but
in
fact,
mail
fraud
is...
is
a
single
term
of
art.
it
refers
simply
to
a
criminal
violation
for
which
there...
there
is
no
exact
civil
counterpart.
and
so,
if
you
take
mail
fraud
as
being
a
unified
term
of
art,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
falls
apart,
because
you
can't
treat
the
fraud
in
the
mail
fraud
the
way
you
treated
the
conspiracy
standing
alone
in
beck.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
was
no
definition
of
bankruptcy
fraud
as
a
separate
definition,
was
there?
whereas
in
mail
fraud,
we
know
what
it
means.
