justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
explain
why
your
argument
is
consistent
with
beck
versus
prupis?
in
that
case,
couldn't
the
plaintiff
show
that
it
was
injured
by
reason
of
the
criminal
violation
that
was
alleged,
the
rico
conspiracy;
and,
yet,
the
court
said
something
more
was
required,
taking
an
additional
requirement
from
the
law
of
civil
conspiracy?
how
is
your
argument
here
consistent
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but...
well,
the
meaning
of
a
rico
conspiracy
in
the
criminal
context
is
very
well
known.
i
don't
know
why
it
matters
whether
it
is
defined
in
the
statute
or
not;
and
there
is
no
requirement
in
that
that
anybody
be
injured
by
virtue
of
an
unlawful,
overt
act.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
appropriate
there
to
look
to
the
law
of
civil
conspiracy
and
yet
inappropriate
here
to
look
to
the
law
of
civil
fraud?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
understand
that,
but
when
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
consists
of
predicate
acts
of
mail
fraud,
why
isn't...
why
does
not
beck
point
you
to
the
word
rico
statute?
so
why
if
you
look
to
civil
conspiracy
to
understand
what
rico
statute,
why
do
you
not
look
to
rico
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
can
say
the
same
in
beck.
it
would
make
civil
conspiracy
the
predicate
act
in
rico,
rather
than...
the
rico
violation,
rather
than
criminal
conspiracy.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
rico
statute
doesn't
say
you
can
recover
if
you're
injured
by
reason
of
conspiracy,
without
any
elaboration.
it
says
"by
reason
of
a
violation
of
this
statute.
"
and
therefore
you
look
to
1962(d),
which
tells
you
what
the
violation
is.
it's
a
rico...
it's
a
criminal
rico
conspiracy.
so
i
just
don't
see
how
that
argument
works.
