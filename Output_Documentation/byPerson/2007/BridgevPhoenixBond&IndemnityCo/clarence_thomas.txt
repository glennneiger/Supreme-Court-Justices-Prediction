the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
bridge
versus
phoenix
bond
&
indemnity
company,
number
07-210.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
each
year,
the
cook
county
illinois
treasurer's
office
holds
a
public
auction
at
which
it
sells
tax
liens
that
it
has
acquired
on
the
property
of
delinquent
taxpayers.
prospective
buyers
bid
on
the
liens,
not
in
cash
amounts
but
rather
by
stating
a
percentage
penalty,
the
property
owner
must
pay
the
winning
bidder
to
clear
the
lien.
because
liens
acquired
in
this
manner
are
valuable
commodities,
the
auctions
are
marked
by
a
stiff
competition
and
most
parcels
attract
multiple
bidders
willing
to
accept
a
zero
percent
penalty.
to
break
the
tie
among
zero
percent
bidders,
the
country
allocates
liens
on
a
rotating
basis
thereby,
ensuring
a
fair
apportionment
of
liens.
in
order
to
present
manipulation
of
its
rotational
allocation
system,
the
county
adopted
the
so-called
"single
simultaneous
bidder
rule,"
which
requires
bidders
to
bid
in
their
own
names
and
prohibits
them
from
using
agents
or
related
entities
to
submit
simultaneous
bids
for
the
same
parcel.
upon
registration,
each
bidder
must
submit
a
sworn
affidavit
affirming
that
it
complies
with
the
county's
rule.
the
parties
in
this
case
were
regular
participants
in
the
tax
sale.
respondents
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
petitioners
had
fraudulently
obtained
a
disproportionate
share
of
liens
by
submitting
false
attestations
of
compliance
with
the
county's
rule
and
collusively
bidding
on
the
same
parcels.
respondents
alleged
a
cause
of
action
under
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act
or
rico,
which
provides
a
right
of
action
for
treble
damages
to
any
person
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
rico's
criminal
prohibitions,
including
its
prohibition
on
conducting
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
respondents
alleged
that
petitioners
violated
rico
through
pattern
of
mail
fraud
because
they
used
the
mail
in
furtherance
of
their
fraudulent
scheme
when
they
sent
property
owners
various
notices
required
by
illinois
law.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
respondent's
complaint
holding
that
they
failed
to
state
a
claim
under
rico
because
they
did
not
receive
and
therefore
did
not
rely
on
petitioner's
false
attestations
of
compliance
with
the
county's
rules,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
a
party
directly
insured
by
a
fraudulent
misrepresentation
may
state
a
claim
under
rico
even
if
he
did
not
rely
on
misrepresentation.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
applicable
statutory
provisions
require
a
plaintiff
alleging
injury
by
reason
of
a
pattern
of
mail
fraud
to
show
that
it
relied
on
the
defendant's
misrepresentations.
it
is
undisputed
that
a
showing
of
reliance
is
not
required
to
establish
a
violation
of
rico's
criminal
prohibition.
and
rico
provides
a
right
of
action
to
any
person
injured
by
reason
of
a
violation,
not
merely
to
those
who
rely
on
the
misrepresentation.
accepting
these
allegations
as
true,
respondents
clearly
were
injured
by
petitioners'
violation
of
the
act.
they
lost
valuable
liens
they
otherwise
would
have
been
awarded.
rico's
plain
terms
thus
provide
them
with
the
cause
of
action.
petitioners
argue
however
that
we
should
presume
that
congress
intended
reliance
to
be
an
element
of
rico
claims
based
on
fraud
because
reliance
is
an
element
of
common-law
fraud.
but
congress
made
mail
fraud,
not
common-law
fraud
to
predicate
act
under
rico,
and
mail
fraud
is
a
statutory
offense
distinct
from
common-law
fraud.
while
we
generally
presume
that
congress
intends
to
adopt
the
subtle
meaning
of
common-law
terms
it
uses,
here,
congress
did
not
use
a
term
with
a
saddled
common-law
meaning
nor
does
a
plaintiff
alleging
injury
by
reason
of
a
pattern
of
mail
fraud
have
to
show
that
it
relied
on
the
defendant's
misrepresentations
in
order
to
establish
proximate
causation.
there
is
no
common-law
principle
that
a
fraudulent
misrepresentation
can
cause
legal
injury
only
to
those
who
rely
on
that
misrepresentation.
to
the
contrary,
the
common-law
has
long
recognized
that
plaintiffs
can
recover
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
whereas
here,
their
injuries
result
directly
from
the
defendant's
fraudulent
misrepresentations
to
a
third-party.
finally,
we
reject
petitioner's
argument
that
we
should
require
a
showing
of
first-party
reliance
in
order
to
avoid
the
overfederalization
of
traditional
state-law
claims.
we
have
repeatedly
refused
to
adopt
narrowing
constructions
of
rico
in
order
to
make
it
conformed
to
a
preconceived
notion
of
what
congress
intended
to
proscribe
and
we
see
no
reason
to
change
course
here.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
statute's
text
for
a
first-party
reliance
requirement.
and
if
the
absence
of
such
a
requirement
leads
to
the
undue
proliferation
of
rico
suits,
the
correction
must
lie
with
congress.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
