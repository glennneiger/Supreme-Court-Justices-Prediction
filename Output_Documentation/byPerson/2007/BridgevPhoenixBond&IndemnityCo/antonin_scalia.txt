but
that
doesn't
even
comport
with
common-law
civil
cases.
i
mean,
for
a
long
time
courts
have
allowed
someone
who's
been
euchred
by
a
competitor's
misrepresentations
to
his
customers.
an
old
new
york
case
that
was
discussed
in
the
briefs
that
i
used
to
teach
in
contracts
class,
where
he
told
somebody
that
the
horse
was
no
longer
for
sale
and
it
was
still
for
sale,
and
the
person
who
wanted
to
sell
the
horse
at
the
higher
price
should
have...
to
buy
the
horse
should
have
had
a
cause
of
action,
even
though
the
representation
was
not
made
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i...
am
i
reading
these
provisions
wrong?
i
thought
you
were
proceeding
in
a
1961,
and
that
the
conspiracy...
the
conspiracy
provision
is
1962(c).
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
conspiracy
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
looking
on
page
2
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
have
i...
have
i
been
misinformed?
the
blue
brief,
page
2,
maybe
that's
wrong,
but
that's
what
it
says.
it
says
1962(c),
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
conspire
to
violate
any
of
the
provisions
of
subsections
(a),
(b)
or
(c).
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see,
i
see,
i
see.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
is
it...
i
really
worry
about
adopting
a
rule
which
would
produce
the
result
that
whenever
anyone
makes
a
false
statement
in
an
official
form,
someone
who
is
deprived
of
a
business
opportunity,
or
at
least
can
say
so,
can
bring
a
rico
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
you
show...
why
couldn't...
that's
like
the
situation
where
a
company
runs
a...
runs
a
lottery
and
in
fact
misrepresents
what
the
odds
are.
and
then
you
mean
the
people
can't
recover
because
they
couldn't
show
that
they
would
have
won?
it
seems
to
me
you
can
calculate
the
difference
in
the
odds
or
something
and
place
some
value
on
that.
is
it
really
painless
to
say,
you
know,
i'm
running
a
lottery
and
your
chances
of
winning
are
one
in
a
thousand,
and
everybody
buys
a
ticket
on
that
basis,
and
it
turns
out
that
really
your
chances
are
one
in
a
million?
nobody
has
a
cause
of
action
because
nobody
can
prove
he
would
have
won?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
they
can
get?
just
what
they
paid
for
the
ticket?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
it's
because
there's
no
common-law
equivalent.
i
think
it's
simply
because
the
word
19...
under
1962(c).
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
conspire.
"
and
we
have
to
interpret
the
word
"conspire",
and
we
say
we
give
it
its
common-law
meaning;
whereas,
for
a
violation
of
the
general
racketeering
statute,
there's...
there's
no
equivalent
reference
to
a
word
that
we
have
to
give
content
to.
it
just
says...
unless
it's
the
word
"indictable".
