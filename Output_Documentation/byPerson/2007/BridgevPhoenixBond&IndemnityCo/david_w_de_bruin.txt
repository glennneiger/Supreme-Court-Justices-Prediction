mr.
david
w.
debruin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
presumed
true
in
this
case
that
petitioners
submitted
false
affidavits,
filled
the
auction
room
with
related
entities,
and
obtained
thousands
of
liens
that
would
have
been
awarded
to
respondents
and
other
bidders,
causing
them
injury
in
fact.
i
submit
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
on
those
facts
respondents
can
establish
proximate
cause,
and
specifically
whether
in
order
to
do
so
they
must
establish
that
they
personally
received
and
relied
upon
the
false
statements
at
issue.
i
submit
that
this
court
already
has
established
in
its
decisions
in
holmes
and
in
anza
the
proper
test
for
proximate
cause.
and
no
claim
has
been
made
in
this
case,
at
least
not
until
perhaps
briefly
this
morning,
that
the
respondents
cannot
establish
proximate
cause
under
the
standards
set
forth
in
those
cases.
moreover,
no
argument
is
made
that
the
standards
articulated
in
holmes
and
in
anza
are
insufficient
to
ferret
out
the
appropriate
cases
that
can
go
forward;
that
those
cases
produce
anomalous
results
either
here
or
in
any
other
case
that
has
been
decided.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
your
honor,
all
of
the
elements
of
rico
would
have
to
be
established.
there
would
have
to
be
predicate
acts
of
mail
fraud.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
and
they
would
have
to
form
a
pattern
and
all
the
other
requirements
that
were
significant
would
have
to
be
met,
but
yes.
and
i
submit
in
this
case
there
is
no
serious
dispute
but
that
the
allegations
over
the
course
of
many
years
of
the
complaint
established
indictable
mail
fraud.
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
fact
pattern
is
under
the
common
law
tortious
interference
or
some
other
common-law
tort.
the
question
is:
do
the
facts
as
alleged
make
out
indictable
mail
fraud?
there
is
no
question
but
the
mail
fraud
statute
is
broad.
it
prohibits
any
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud;
and
i
believe
that
if
the
facts
here
were
proved,
the
submission
of
false
affidavits
to
the
county
on
a
regular
basis,
there
is
no
need
under
mail
fraud
to
prove
reliance.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
mails
here
are
an
essential
component
to
allow
this
fraud
to
have
any
effect.
if
it
weren't
for
the
use
of
the
mail,
the
petitioners
could
never
realize
the
economic
value
of
the
liens
that
they
obtained
through
the
fraud.
and
in
that
sense
the
use
of
the
mails
are
essential
to
the
scheme.
and
that's
what
this
court
held
in
the
schmuck
decision:
that
the
mails,
themselves,
don't
have
to
be
false
so
long
as
the
use
of
the
mails
is
essential
to
the
scheme.
here
it
clearly
is.
absent
the
notices
given
to
property
owners,
there
would
be
no
way
for
the
petitioners
to
realize
the
value
of
the
liens
and
obtain
the
benefit
of
the
fraud
by...
by
making
the
false
statements
to
the
county
and
literally
obtaining
thousands
of
additional
liens
that
otherwise
would
have
gone
to
other
entities.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
the
court
has
already
addressed
that
in
anza
and
has
made
clear
that
if
in
an
appropriate
case
the
government
had
been
harmed
and
was
in
fact...
could
be
expected
to
sue,
as
it
was
in
anza...
in
that
case
the
claim
was
that
the
defendant
had
not
paid
its
taxes
to
the
state
of
new
york.
and
the
court
found
that
new
york
was
the
directly
injured
party,
could
be
expected
to
sue,
and
under
anza
there
was
no
proximate
cause.
we
accept
that
test.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
well,
we
have
to
establish
predicate
acts
of
mail
fraud,
but
we
also
have
to
establish
proximate
cause.
and
under
anza
the
failure
was
an
inability
to
prove
proximate
cause.
in
this
case
it
has
not
been
seriously
disputed
that
we
satisfy
the
factors
set
forth
in
anza.
the
county
was
not
harmed.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
well,
the
only
time
that
the
affidavits
and
the
representations
in
this
case
have
effect
is
if
all
the
bids
are
zero.
the
county,
in
order
to
protect
itself
from
property
owners,
provides
that
if
there
are
multiple
bids
above
zero,
the
county
will
not
issue
the
lien.
it
holds
the
lien
itself.
the
only
time
that
this
rule
comes
into
effect
where
there
is
a
rotational
award
is
if
the
county
is
paid
its
taxes
in
full,
and
there
are
multiple
bidders
at
zero
percent.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
not
the
way
the
county
administers
these
auctions.
if
that
happened...
and
it
certainly
could
happen...
that
the
bidding
process
that
takes
the
penalty
down
stopped
at
five
percent
or
two
percent,
the
county
rules
under
the
program
at
issue
provide
the
county
will
not
apply
the
rotational
system.
it
won't
award
the
lien
at
all.
the
rotational
rule
only
applies
when
there
are
multiple,
zero-percent
bids.
and
respondents
will
show,
as
this
case
goes
forward,
that
they
can
identify
the
specific
properties
on
which
there
were
multiple
bids;
that
the
petitioners
and
the
related
entities,
which
they
will
prove
are
related,
received
liens
and
thereby
increased
to
the
thousands
the
number
of
valuable
liens
that
the
petitioners
got,
leaving
the
respondents
essentially
with
hundreds
of
liens.
the
key
is,
the
central
question
is,
whether
petitioners
can
show
proximate
cause
under
the
standards
in
holmes
and
anza.
and
under
anza
what
this
court
held
is
the
central
question
for
proximate
cause
is
the
directness
between
the
violation
alleged
and
the
injury.
and
in
this
case
there
is
a
direct
relation
between
the
violation
of
mail
fraud
alleged,
the
predicate
acts,
and
the
injury
that
respondents
have
incurred.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
justice
alito,
beck
was
a
completely
different
case.
the
issue
in
beck
was...
section
1964(c)
says
that
the
plaintiff
must
prove
injury
by
reason
of
a
violation
of
the
act.
and
the
violation
of
the
act
at
issue
in
beck
was
1962(d),
which
is
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
other
provisions.
and
so
what
the
court
was
looking
at
was
the
word
"conspiracy",
which
was
not
defined
in
the
statute.
and
the
court
applied
the
accepted
rule
that
where
a
word
is
not
defined,
the
court
can
assume
that
congress
intended
its
ordinary
meaning.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
but
the
court
looked
to--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--well,
it
looked
to
conspiracy
to
make
up
the
elements
of
the
civil
cause
of
action
there.
but
here
the
relevant
provision
that
is
relied
upon
is
1962(c),
which
is
a
violation
of
rico.
and
we
also
alleged
16,
1962(d).
but
in
(c)
the
violation
of
rico
is
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
none
of
those
words,
"conducting
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise.
"
are
words
that
petitioners
contend
you
look
to
the
common
law
to
define.
there
could
be
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
that
would
consist
of
fraud,
of
violence,
of
bribery
all
together.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
1961
is
the
definitions.
we
allege
a
violation
of
both
1962(c)
and
1962(d).
mr.
david
w.
debruin
1962(d)
is
the
conspiracy.
we
allege
a
violation
of
that.
we
also
allege
a
violation
of
1962(c).
mr.
david
w.
debruin
your
honor,
the
citation
appears
at
the
bottom
of
the
quote,
the
way
it's
set
forth
on
page
2.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
so
if
you
look
at
the
very
first
quotation,
you'll
see
where
it
follows.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
so
in
this
case,
we
allege
both
a
violation
of
1962(c)
and
(d).
1962(c)
prohibits
conducting
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
that
pattern
may
consist
of
fraud,
violence,
bribery--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--i
would
say
two
things:
first,
what
that
argument
would
do
would
make
essentially
common-law
fraud
the
predicate
act
under
rico,
when
instead
it
is
indictable
mail
fraud,
not
common-law
fraud.
and--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--well,
the
court,
again,
in
beck,
was
looking
to
the
common-law
word
"conspiracy"
to
apply
it
in
different
contexts.
there
is
not
a
common-law
fraud
that
is
actionable
under
rico.
but
secondly,
even
if
you
accept
that
test,
justice
alito,
under
the
common
law
of
fraud,
there
is
no
doubt
that
claims
like
ours
were
actionable
and
were
actionable
as
fraud.
the
case
that
justice
scalia
referenced
to,
the
common-law
cases
involving
the
buyer
of
cheese
and
other
facts,
those
were
actionable
as
fraud
where--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--well,
under
the
law
of
torts
as
it
has
evolved,
there
are
different
labels
that
are
applied.
but
what
was
critical
is
that
that
conduct,
the
interference
through
fraud
with
a
contract
of
another,
was
actionable
at
the
common
law.
the
plaintiff
could
make
out
a
claim
and
recover
damages,
even
though
the
plaintiff
had
not
received
the
statement
at
issue
and
had
not
relied
on
the
statement
at
issue.
so
that
even
if,
under
rico,
you
were
to
look
for
civil
purposes
to
a
common-law
analogue,
the
common
law
made
clear
that
these
kinds
of
claims
were
actionable,
whatever
label
might
be
applied
to
them
today
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the...
of
the
tort.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
not
true
for
the
reasons
this
court
set
forth
in
anza.
the
standards
set
forth
in
holmes
and
in
anza
are
very
rigorous
tests
to
establish
proximate
cause.
so
the
merely
assertion
of
falsity
by
a
competitor...
i
mean,
anza
involved
a
competitor
situation.
there
the
claim
was
that
had
been
mail
fraud
that
caused
the
competitor
harm.
the
court
recognized
in
anza
that
that
case
was
different
than
holmes.
there
was
an
allegation
of
a
direct
injury
in
anza,
but
nevertheless
the
relation
between
the
violation
and
the
harm
was
far
less
direct
than
it
is
in
this
case,
as
judge
easterbrook,
chief
judge
easterbrook
explained.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
justice
scalia,
i
would
say
two
things:
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
critical
to
realize
that
congress
enacted
rico
to
protect
competitors.
one
of
the
principal
motivations
behind
rico
was
to
protect
legitimate
businesses
that
are
injured
in
their
business
or
property
by
reason
of
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
as
defined
under
the
statute.
that's
number
one.
number
two,
there
are
important
restrictions
that
this
court
repeatedly
has
recognized.
it's
not
enough
that
there
be
a
single
act.
there
must
be
predicate
acts
that
are
a
pattern
of
activity.
"pattern"
doesn't
just
mean
two.
it
means
a
continuing
threat
of
continuing
criminal
activity.
there
must
be
proximate
cause
under
holmes
and
anza.
all
of
those
restrictions
exist.
and
only
if
the
plaintiff
can
successfully
navigate
all
of
those
things,
proving
not
common-law
fraud
but
indictable
criminal
activity,
proving
a
pattern
of
continuing
criminal
activity,
proving
proximate
cause,
only
then
can
the
plaintiff
make
out
a
rico
violation.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
in
this
case,
we
don't
submit
that
we
are
the
only
potential
plaintiffs.
that
there
were
other
bidders...
the
bidders
at
these
auctions
fall
into
perhaps
two
different
categories.
many
bidders...
over
50
percent
of
all
the
registered
bidders
receive
fewer
than
10
liens.
in
other
words,
they
are
at
the
auction
to
bid
on
a
specific
property
or
small
number
of
properties.
then
there
are
other
what
i
would
call
professional
tax
buyers,
who
basically
do
research,
identify
the
most
attractive
properties,
and
we
will
show,
are
essentially
bidding
on
the
same
group
of
properties.
and
those
are
the
properties
at
issue.
those
are
the
bidders
at
issue.
it
is
more
than
just
the
respondents,
but
it
is
a
relatively
small
group--
mr.
david
w.
debruin
--well,
i
think
the
court...
again,
if
you
look
to
the
anza
case,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
if
a
rico
defendant
takes
actions
that
simply
enhance
the
defendant's
own
competitive
position,
which
was
the
allegation
in
anza,
that
that
may
not
be
enough
to
establish
proximate
cause.
but
whereas
here
the
foreseeable
and
clear
effect
of
defendant's
actions
is
to
work
a
direct
injury
on
competitors
and,
in
fact,
on
no
one
else,
not
on
the
county,
not
on
the
property
owners,
but
only
on
competitors,
that
was
within
the
ambit
of
what
congress
sought
to
protect
in
rico.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
well,
yes.
as
this
court
recognized
in
storey
parchment
and
hazeltine,
in
antitrust
cases
as
well
as
rico
cases,
damage
issues
have
to
be
worked
out.
but
the
fact
that
there
may
be
multiple
bidders
that
you
may
have
to
award
damages
to
a
group
does
not
defeat
the
claim.
the
defendant
cannot
come
into
court
and
say
because
damages
here
have
to
be
allocated
among
a
larger
number
of
people,
you
can't
establish
a
claim.
mr.
david
w.
debruin
justice
kennedy,
the
common-law
rule
actually
was,
i
believe,
in
27
of
40
states...
this
unfortunately
came
up
after
the
briefing...
that
a
disappointed
bidder
could
bring
an
action
at
the
common
law
if
the
allegation
was
one
of
fraud
in
the
procurement.
so
that
the
common
law
did
not
provide
an
absolute
bar
to
claims
like
this.
now,
again,
the
issue
is:
will
the
claims
satisfy
holmes
and
anza?
there
is
no
argument
here
that
that
standard,
the
framework
this
court
established
first
in
holmes
and
then
applied
in
anza,
that
that
framework
is
inadequate,
that
it
produces
an
anomalous
result
here
or
will
produce
an
anomalous
result
in
other
cases.
it's
a
very
rigorous
test.
this
court
looked
at
directness;
it
looked
to
the
suitability
of
other
plaintiffs;
it
looked
to
whether
the
harm
was
derivative.
that's
a
quintessential
proximate
cause
analysis.
proximate
cause
is,
historically
through
the
common
law,
a
very
fact-based
intensive
test.
but
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
ability
of
the
rico
plaintiff
to
overcome
that
test,
it's
a
significant
showing
that
must
be
met.
chief
judge
easterbrook,
in
this
case,
went
through
the
anza
factors
very
methodically.
he
showed
that,
under
each
factor,
proximate
cause
clearly
can
be
met
under
the
common
law.
the
respondents
were
directly
injured
in
a
significant
and
substantial
way,
and
that
is
sufficient,
i
submit,
to
make
out
the
elements
of
the
rico
claim,
assuming
all
the
other
elements
are
also
met.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
