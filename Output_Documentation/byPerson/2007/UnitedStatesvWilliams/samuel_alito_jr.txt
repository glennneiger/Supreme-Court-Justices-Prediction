well,
general
clement,
is
there--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--is
there
anything
to
suggest
that
some
of
these
hypotheticals,
where
people
get
child
pornography
unsolicited
in
the
mail
or
that
kids
at
school
are
showing
each
other
not
just
dirty
pictures
but
actual
child
pornography,
are
situations
that
occur
with
any
frequency
in
the
real
world?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
you
say
is
the
best
realistic
example
that
you
can
provide
to
show
that
this
is
overbroad?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doing...
doing
what?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
here
we
have...
we
have
one
statute
that
covers
advertising,
promoting,
presenting,
distributing,
and
soliciting.
suppose
that
all
of
those
activities
were
not
lumped
together
in
one
statute,
and
there
was
a
separate
provision
for
each,
and
suppose
that
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
problem
with
one
of
them.
let's
say
promotes
or
presents.
would
all
of
the
others
fall
as
well,
under
the
overbreadth
doctrine,
if
they
were
set
out
in
separate
statutory
provisions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
one
person
says
to
another,
can
we
get
some
child
pornography,
how
is
that
solicitation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
oh,
"can
you
get
me".
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
think
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
asking
someone
for
child
pornography
is
protected?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
it's
not
thought
at
that
point.
it's
a
request
to
obtain
contraband,
which
fuels
the
production
of
the
contraband.
is
it
protected
by
the
first
amendment
or
not,
soliciting
child
pornography?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
to
fall...
to
fall
under
the
statute
or
to
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
or
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
which
is
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
mean
the
model
penal
code
has
a
general
prohibition
of
soliciting
illegal
activities.
are
you
saying
that
that's...
that
provision
violates
the
first
amendment?
because
it's
just
words?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
thought
the
word
in
the
statute
is
"solicit".
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you're
asking
somebody
for
child
pornography,
you're
not
presenting
child
pornography.
