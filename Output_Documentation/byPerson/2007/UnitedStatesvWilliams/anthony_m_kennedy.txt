suppose
the
distributor
attaches
the
movie
review.
it's
in
[amazondotcom,]
and
then
it
has
the
movie
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
your
answer
to
the...
all
of
the
hypotheticals
that
are
put
forth
in
the
coalition
for
free
speech,
the
catholic
bishops,
the
advertisement
in
[amazondotcom]
or
netflix,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's...
pardon
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
there
are
minors,
so
that
the
content
aspect
of
it
is
film.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
there
are
real
minors
in
some
of
these
things.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
one
had
a
hand
held
video
at
a
school
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
two
things
that
you...
that
all
of
us
have
to
work
with
here.
one
is
the
scienter
component
here.
is
that
overly
broad,
vague,
and
so
forth?
the
other
is
the
content.
and
my
concern
is
the
same
as
that
indicated
by
justice
stevens
at
the
outset.
there
are
some
terrible
practices
in
the
child-trafficking
area
where
children
are
held
in
brothels
for
the
most
debased
of
acts.
there
are
abuses
in
prisons,
abuses
in
schools.
if
there
are
videotapes
showing
those
things,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
is...
that
they're
clearly
covered
by
the
statute,
and
maybe
even
a
killing
of
a
little
girl
in
public
might
be
sadistic.
assume
that
that's
covered
by
the
statute.
is
there
anything
in
the
"presents"
and
the
"promotes"
language
in
the
scienter
component
of
the
statute
that
gives
some
protection
to
these
materials?
is
it
just
as-applied?
is
that
what
we
have
to
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
want
the
public
to
see
this
to
show
them
how
bad
it
is,
and
that
is
permitted
under
the
statute,
because
it
is
not
"presenting"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree
with
you
that
we
have
different
motives.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
statute
covers
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
if
we
were
going
to
do
that
it
would
be
simpler
and
maybe
prudent
for
us
to
reexamine
our
overbreadth
rule.
your
client
here
falls
within
none
of
these
examples.
he
was
convicted
of
having
what
everyone
recognizes
as
not
only
child
pornography
but
involving
a
very
small
child.
and
he
knew
what
it
was.
and
he...
and
he
conveyed
that
belief.
given
the
fact
that
it
would
appear
that
child
pornography
is
a
growing
problem,
a
serious
problem
on
the
internet,
maybe
we
should
examine
the
overbreadth
rule
and
just
say
that
your
client
cannot
make
this
challenge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
reject
the
overbreadth
challenge
here
and
still
leave
an
overbreadth
doctrine
for
some
other
cases?
i'm
not
sure
how
we
could
do
that.
