mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
made
clear
that
speech
proposing
an
unlawful
transaction
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
speech
that
falsely
proposes
an
unlawful
transaction
is
likewise
unprotected.
the
statute
at
issue
here
properly
construed
does
no
more
than
prohibit
efforts
to
offer
or
solicit
materials
that
are
contraband
and
then
prevents
somebody
from
turning
around
after
soliciting
or
offering
contraband
and
suggesting
that
the
materials
either
did
not
exist
or
were
not
contraband
after
all.
the
statute
does
not
prohibit
truthful
speech
about
lawful
materials.
accordingly,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
striking
the
statute
down
on
its
face.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
think
that
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
we
don't
think
that
that
would
involve...
in
the
first
point,
we
don't
think
it
would
involve
presentation
or
promotion
of
the
movie
in
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
we
think
those
terms
are
really
limited
to
efforts
to
make
the
product
available
to
the
market.
and
i
think
if
you
read
those
terms
in
conjunction
with
each
other,
they
are
all
directed
at
efforts
to
make
the
product
available
to
the
market.
now,
so
if
the
person
whose
actually
distributing
the
film
wants
to
try
to
market
it
as
actual
child
pornography,
then
i
suppose
that
would
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
but
a
movie
reviewer
does
not
have
anything
to
worry
about
in
the
first
instance
because
i
don't
think
that
would
come
within
the
term--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again,
justice
kennedy,
it
might
be
conceptually
possible
for
somebody
to
market,
let's
say
a
mainstream
movie,
on
the
basis
of
a...
either
their
own
statement
or
an
attached
review,
that
misrepresents
the
nature
of
the
movie
and
makes
a
claim
for
the
movie,
that
it's
actual
child
pornography.
i
suppose
in
that
unusual
circumstance,
it
would
be
covered.
but
i
guess
it
would
be
equally
possible
for
somebody
to
take
one
of
the
countless
mainstream
movies
that
portrays
a
murder
on
screen,
and
say
this
is
actually
a
snuff
film.
there's
actually...
this
was
a
snuff
film.
this
was
an
actual
murder.
now,
somebody
who
did
that
would
be
clearly
misrepresenting
the
film.
i
don't
think
they
would
turn
around
if
somebody
tried
to
do
something
about
that
false
or
misleading
speech
and
be
able
to
defend
on
that
speech
because
it
would
be
clearly
false
and
misleading
speech.
and
i
think
what
is
important
here
is
if
the
underlying
movie
is
not
child
pornography,
then
truthful
efforts
to
promote
that
movie
won't
be
captured.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
the
movie
itself
comes
within
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
if
it
were
done
in
a
sufficiently
graphic
way,
that
it
was
captured--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
there's...
i
guess
there's
an
anterior
problem,
which
is
if
the
depiction
were
sufficiently
graphic--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
person
that
would
have
that
film
would
be
in
possession
of
child
pornography,
which
itself
would
be
a
problem
under
the
statute.
he's
in
the
possession
of
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
that
might
be
an
example
where,
starting
with
the
basic
prohibition
on
the
possession
of
child
pornography,
that
might
be
a
situation
where
there
was
a
valid
as-applied
challenge.
and
that
also
might
be
a
situation
where
there
would
be
a
valid
as-applied
challenge
to
the
pandering
and
solicitation
provision.
but
i
think
the
proper
way
to
analyze
that
is
to
ask
first
whether
or
not
something
is
covered
by
the
basic
prohibition.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
agree,
and
i
think
in
theory,
at
least,
there
may
be
valid
as-applied
challenges
to
the
underlying
prohibition.
and
this
court
of
course
in
ferber
recognized
that
possibility
in
upholding
the
basic
prohibition
on
the
promotion
of
child
pornography
in
that
context.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
is,
justice
ginsburg
but
i
think
in
context
that
would
not
be
something
that
comes
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
and
again,
if
you
start
with
the
proposition
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
understand
that,
justice
ginsburg.
what
i
would
say
is
this
statute
in
order
to
apply,
at
least
the
way
we
interpret
it,
requires
both
an
objective
and
a
subjective
component.
and
so
you
would
have
to
have
a
situation
where
that
promotion
of
the
movie
objectively
would
lead
somebody
to
believe
that
you're
marketing
in
a
manner
that
portrays
it
as
actual
child
pornography.
now
i
think
what
you've
just
said
right
there
would
probably
fail
at
the
objective
test
because
i
think
particularly
when
you
start
talking
about
it
being
a
motion
picture
and
the
like,
the
natural
assumption...
let's
say
it's
a
mainstream
motion
picture,
is
going
to
be
oh,
that's
just
actors,
it's
probably
adult
actors,
or
a
body
double
or
something.
i
don't
think
that
comes
within
the
statute.
the
other
thing
that's
required,
of
course,
is
a
subjective
component...
specific
intent
is
the
way
that
we
would
read
the
statute.
and
clearly
the
person
who's
marketing
lolita
itself
and
wants
people
to
go
see
it
in
a
mainstream
box
office
does
not
have
the
intent
to
convey
to
people
that
this
is
actual,
forbidden
child
pornography.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
souter,
i
would
say
that
the
better
answer
is
no,
that
he
has
not.
now--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
souter,
i
would
say
no
for
a
more
fundamental
reason,
which
is
i
think
you
have
to
read
two
provisions
of
the
statute
here
in
pari
materia.
and
the
other
provision
i
think
that
is
relevant
is
the
affirmative
defense
that's
in
subsection
(d)
of
the
statute,
which
is
at
6a
of
the
appendix
to
our
opening
gray
brief.
and
that
provides
an
affirmative
defense
in
the
situation
where
somebody
is
in
possession
of
child
pornography.
now,
the
first
problem
the
person
who
gets
child
pornography
in
the
mail
has
is
that
the
statute...
the
bans
of
possession
would
apply.
now,
there's
an
affirmative
defense.
the
affirmative
defense
is
specific
to
possession,
but
one
of
the
things
that's
a
prerequisite
to
qualify
for
the
affirmative
defense,
which
is
in
(d)(2)(b)
is
that
you
have
to
afford
that
material...
you
have
to
afford
the
agency,
the
law
enforcement
agency,
access
to
the
material.
now--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--you're
right,
justice
souter,
but
that
is
a
problem
both
for
the
prohibition
on
possession
and
it
is
not
a
unique
problem
for
the
pandering
solicitation
provision.
and
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
you
might
have
to
if...
in
that
situation,
you
might
have
to
actually
present
your
affirmative
defense
in
some
case
is
a
reason
to
strike
a
ban
on
possession
as
overbroad.
but
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
souter,
let
me
try
two
responses.
one
is
i
do
think
you
have
a
problem
even
in
possession
because
once
you
get
it
in
the
mail,
your
possession
of
it
is
knowing.
and
that
is
precisely
why
congress
included
this
affirmative
defense
in
the
statute.
the
second
thing
i
would
say
though
is
again,
we
have
to
read
these
statutes
in
pari
materia,
and
if
one
of
the
ways
you
qualify
for
the
affirmative
defense
is
you
afford
access
to
law
enforcement
agency
of
the
material,
i
don't
think
that
which
is
a
prerequisite
for
qualifying
for
the
affirmative
defense
can
be
independently
prohibited--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--by
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well...
and,
again,
i
think
if
you
did
no
more
than
that,
i
don't
know
that
you
would
necessarily
be
covered
by
the
statute,
but
if
you
said
i
got
this
disgusting
child
pornography
in
the
mail,
it's
clearly
unlawful,
here
take
a
look,
i
mean
i
suppose
that
is
covered
by
the
statute.
but
that
doesn't
seem
like
a
natural
reaction.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
we
would
take
the
position
that
even
if
you
are
presenting
the
material,
making
it
available,
but
you're
not
charging
for
it,
you're
not
exchanging
it,
you're
just
offering
it
for
free,
here's
a
quick
free
look,
it's
still
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
breyer,
i
mean,
you
know,
i
think
you
could
certainly
interpret
the
statute
to
write
around
that
problem
if
you
wanted
to,
but
i
do
think
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
terms
"promotes,
distributes,
presents,
and
advertises.
"
is
to
capture
not
just
somebody
who
is
making
that
available
to
the
market
for
sale
or
for
barter,
but
also
somebody
who
says
look,
i
have
child
pornography,
i
want
to
get
you
interested
in
this,
this
is
the
real
stuff,
here
take
a
look.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
here...
i
mean
i
think
my
first
cut
at
drawing
the
line
would
to
be
say
it's
not
a
problem
to
say,
can
you
believe
what
i
got
in
the
mail,
and
talk
to
your
neighbor
about
it,
describe
it.
on
the
other
hand,
i
do
think
you're
presenting
the
materials
if
you
say,
i
got
this
in
the
mail,
look
at
this,
isn't
this
disgusting,
this
is
clearly
child
pornography.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
you
think
though--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
if
you
think
that's
the
difference
between
expanding
this
statute
in
some
enormous
way
and
not,
then
i
would
invite
you
to
have
a
more
restrictive
view
of
"presents".
and
we
certainly
want
you
to
interpret
the
statute
in
a
way
that
renders
it
not
overbroad.
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
made
clear
on
a
number
of
occasions
that,
before
you
get
to
the
overbreadth
analysis,
you
are
applying
the
early
constructions
to
make
sure
that
the
statute
if
possible--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--is
construed
to
be
constitutional.
but
if
i
could
just...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there
may
be
a
distinction
to
be
drawn.
we
certainly
don't
think
that
it's
limited
to
commercial
speech
if
by
"commercial
speech"
you
mean
only
efforts
to
buy
or
sell
or
even
only
efforts
to
barter.
because
we
think
that
somebody
who
sort
of
systematically
is
operating
a
web
site
where
they
are
giving
away
child
pornography
and
advertising
it
as
such
would
be
clearly
covered
by
the
statute.
so,
to
the
extent
that
the
distinction
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
is
at
the
line
where
you
would
say
you're
giving
it
away
gratis,
we
think
that's
still
covered.
now,
i
gather
that
maybe
justice
breyer
had
a
different
conception
in
mind,
that
you
really
have
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
in
fairness,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
we
had
a
slightly
broader
conception
of
"presents".
what
we
were
thinking
that
"presents"
means
is
really
when
you
are
not
just
sort
of...
you
know...
in
some
abstract
way
talking
about
presenting
the
material,
but
you're
actually
furnishing
the
material
to
somebody
else.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--not
at
all,
justice
alito,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
point
with
respect
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
i
mean
you
have
to
remember
that
the
materials
that
we're
talking
about
here
are
in
the
main
materials
that
are
unlawful
even
to
possess.
and
it
is
also
true
that
the...
in
the
wake
of
ferber,
a
pretty
good
job
was
done
of
getting
these
materials
out
of
the
real
world.
so
the
kind
of
pictures
that
are--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--infrequently
occurs...
especially
in
the
real
world,
which
is
to
say
when
pictures
or
magazines
are
being
handed
around
from
adolescent
to
adolescent,
there
is
really
no
reason
in
the
world
to
suspect
that
what's
being
handed
from
adolescent
to
adolescent
is
child
pornography
as
opposed
to
adult
pornography...
playboy
and
that
sort
of
thing.
because
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
in
the
wake
of
ferber,
a
pretty
good
job
has
been
done
in
stamping
out
child
pornography
in
the
real
world.
it
has
moved,
unfortunately,
on
to
the
internet.
and,
in
that
context,
when
people
are
promoting
it
as
actual
child
pornography
or
soliciting
it
as
actual
child
pornography--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
does,
justice
stevens,
but
so,
too,
for
the
basic
prohibition.
and
i
think
what's
important
here
is
there
may
be
some
definitional,
you
know,
questions.
or
you
may
have
a
view
that
there
are
applications
of
the
statute
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
but
what's
important,
i
think,
is
that
this
pandering
and
solicitation
provision
doesn't
add
some
new
definition,
some
more
aggressive
definition.
it
simply
picks
up
the
notion
of
the
basic
definition
of
child
pornography,
and
it
says
that
if
you're
taking
materials
and
you
are
offering
them
to
the
market
as
actual
child
pornography,
if
you
are
soliciting
actual
child
pornography,
then
the
government
can
go
after
the
direct
acts
of
solicitation
and
offering
and...
and...
prosecute
those
acts
without--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
if
the
scienter
requirements
are
satisfied
and
i'm
consciously
trying
to
get
you
to
believe
that
even
though
i
have
something
that
for
some
technical
reason
is
not
the
real
thing,
what
i'm
offering
you
is
the
real
thing,
the
statute
does
target
that.
but
that
seems
to
me
to
not
be
a
first
amendment
problem.
it
seems
to
be
a
natural
consequence
of
congress
taking
the
court's
advice
in
free
speech
coalition
and
moving
from
a
prohibition
on
materials
that
had
been
pandered
to
the
actual
acts
of
pandering
and
solicitation
themselves.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
we
think
that
all
those
hypotheticals
are
taken
out
with
more
than
one
reason.
i
mean,
i
think
from
the
catholic
bishops--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
are
there
real
minors
engaging
in
forbidden
activity?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
actual
child
pornography?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
if
the
underlying
material
is
actually
child
pornography,
then
you
may
be
in
a
different
situation.
all
of
the
hypotheticals
in
that
brief
were
with
materials...
the
underlying
materials
were
not
child
pornography.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction,
because
if
you're
taking
a
movie
like
"traffic"
or
"american
beauty",
which
is
not
child
pornography--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
you're
simply
truthfully
promoting
it,
you
have
nothing
to
worry
about
with
this
statute.
now,
if
you
took
something...
i
also
think
that
the
catholic
bishop
situation
isn't
covered,
because
that
is
not
promoting,
presenting
and
distributing--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean,
again...
i
mean,
if
you
had
a
hand
held
video
and
the
video
itself
was
child
pornography,
and
then
you
got
that
on
the
internet
or
otherwise
and
decided
you
wanted
to
promote
that,
i
mean
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--here
is
how
i
would
try
to
analyze
it,
justice
kennedy,
which
is
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
an
as-applied
challenge
there
because
the
basic
prohibition
on
child
pornography
that
would
apply
to
the
underlying
materials,
there
would
be
an
as-applied
exception
to
that.
and
therefore,
the
pandering
and
the
solicitation
of
that
would
be
equally
outside
the
constitutional--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean
there
would
be
another
way
to
try
to
get
at
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
there
might
be
a
way
in
which
the
statute
could
cover
it,
and
it
would
be,
as
follows,
which
basically
is
if
i'm
going
to
portray
that
as
material
that
is...
and
i'm
going
to
portray
it
only
in
a
way
that
makes
it
clear
that
i
have
a
valid
as-applied
challenge,
then
i'm
not
sure
i
would
be
satisfying
the
objective
and
the
subjective
scienter
requirements
for
that
statute.
because
it
would
be
clear
that,
although
i
was
presenting
it
as
visual
depictions
of
children
who
had
that
happen
to
them,
i
was
presenting
it
exclusively
for
its
scientific,
artistic,
literary
value.
and,
therefore,
in
a
sense,
i
was
building
my
as-applied
challenge
into
the
way
i
was
marketing
it.
i
think
you
could--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
that's
exactly
right.
and
that's
why
i
would
think
the
logical
way
to
proceed
would
be
you
would
find
an
as-applied
exception
to
the
basic
prohibition.
and
then,
naturally,
that
would
apply
to
the
pandering
provision.
i
was
only
sort
of
suggesting,
if
pressed,
that
in
some
ways
it
might
actually
be
easier
to
find
a
way
to
get
that
outside
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
pandering
and
solicitation
provision
than
for
the
possession
for
this.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
that
is
not
correct,
justice
souter.
and
i
would
say
that
that
hypothetical
is
outside
the
ambit
of
the
statute
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
that
the
movie
reviewer
is
promoting
or
presenting
the
underlying
materials.
they
would
be
out
for
that
reason.
i
also
think
they
would
be
out
because,
when
you
started
applying
the
objective
and
the
subjective
requirements
of
the
statute,
you
would
not
find
either
of
them
satisfied
with
respect
to
that.
if
i
know
you're
talking
about
a
mainstream
movie,
and
you
say
it
depicts
sex
with
a
minor,
i'm
not
going
to
naturally
think
that
comes
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute,
that
it
is
actual
child
pornography
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
souter,
that's
why
i
think
it
is
important
to
have
both
an
objective
and
a
subjective
requirement.
and
i
think
the
objective
requirement
alone
would
take
that
out.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
we
would
use
a
reasonable
person.
that's
why--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--exactly,
and
that's
why
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
would
be
fine,
justice
souter,
and
if--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
i
would
submit
that
even
a
17
year
old,
non-law
student
would
know
that
movies
depict
things
that
don't
actually
happen.
when
they
see
a
murder
on
screen,
that's
not
actually
a
murder.
and
so
i
think
they
would
understand
that
that's
a
movie.
it's
not
child
pornography.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
"traffic"
is
not
child
pornography.
i
understand
that
the
actress
was
17
at
the
time
of
the
film,
but
we
don't
think
that
comes
within
the
ambit
of
the
basic
prohibition
on
child
pornography,
because
we
think
that
simulated
sexual
activity
has
to
be
interpreted
with
enough
subtlety
that
it
doesn't
capture
that.
and
that's
the
position--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
does.
but
so
does
the
statute
in
ferber.
and
we
don't
think
that
introduced
any
overbreadth
or
vagueness
that
was
fatal.
this
statute
here
just
picks
up
on
that
definition.
it
doesn't
add
to
it.
if
i
may
reserve--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
overbreadth,
as
this
court
has
reminded
us
any
number
of
times,
is
strong
medicine,
and
that
is
why,
even
in
the
first
amendment
context,
as-applied
challenges
remain
the
basic
building
blocks
of
adjudication.
rejection
of
this
overbreadth
challenge
here
does
not
mean
that
the
courts
will
not
be
open
to
here
as-applied
challenges
going
forward.
of
course,
the
respondent
here
has
no
claim
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
you
could,
justice
kennedy.
you
could...
i
mean
the
burden
here
is
on
the
challenger
who
doesn't
say
that
the
statute's
unconstitutional
as-applied
to
them
to
show
substantial
overbreadth
in
absolute
terms
and
relative
to
the
statute's
legitimate
sweep.
and
it's
interesting
that
neither
respondent
nor
the
court
of
appeals
ever
engaged
in
that
latter
inquiry.
and
that's
a
critical
inquiry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg
i'm
not
urging
that
you
get
rid
of
overbreadth
doctrine
once
and
for
all...
probably
be
in
the
government's
interest.
i
am
simply
saying
that
if
you
apply
overbreadth
analyses,
the
way
it
supposed
to
be
applied
it's
not
satisfied
here.
it's
not
just
enough
for
you
to
envision
a
couple
of
hypotheticals.
it
has
to
be
the
overbreadth
has
to
be
substantial
relative
to
the
legitimate
sweep
of
the
statute.
this
court
in
virginia
against
hicks
said
faulted
the
lower
court
opinion
because
it
had
no
analyses
whatsoever
of
valid
versus
invalid
applications.
the
proportionality
aspect
of
this
courts
overbreadth
jurisprudence
was
ignored
entirely.
that
could
be
verbatim
the
holding
of
this
case.
the
11
circuit
did
engage
in
that
relative
analysis.
when
my
brother
was
asked
for
empirical
evidence
about
the
comparison
he
said
he
didn't
have
any.
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
that's
fatal
to
his
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think,
in
the
way
i
would
explain
that
is
i
didn't
think
you
get...
you
found
there
was
such
absolute
overbreadth
that
you
didn't
even
reach
the
proportionality
inquiry.
in
any
invent
hicks
was
decided
afterwards,
and
i
think
hicks
makes
very
clear
that
you
have
to
have
both
absolute
and
relative.
i
would
say
one
last
thing,
though.
this
is
first
and
foremost
you
start
with
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
facts
of
this
case
i
think
caution
against
reading
the
word
presents
out
of
the
statute
or
reading
it
unduly
narrowly.
the
gravamen
of
the
pandering
here
was
not
just
the
offer
of
pictures
of
this
individual
and
his
daughter,
but
was
his
claim
that
i
can
post
these
actual
images
of
child
pornography
on
this
group
site
because
i'm
for
real
and
i'm
not
an
undercover
agent.
now
that
seems
to
be
within
the
epicenter
of
the
statute
but
it's
not
for
profit.
it
was
doing
it
to
establish
his
bona
fide.
thank
you.
