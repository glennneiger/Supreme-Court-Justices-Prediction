chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-694,
united
states
v.
williams.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
i
could
start
with
one
of
the
more
compelling
hypotheticals
on
the
other
side.
let's
say
i'm
a
movie
reviewer.
i
write
a
review
saying
this
is
an
awful
movie.
it
portrays
child
pornography.
aren't
i
presenting
information
in
a
way
that
would
cause
others
to
believe
that
the
movie
contains
child
pornography,
and
wouldn't
that
be
covered
by
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
a
very
different
thing.
i
read
your
brief
the
same
way
justice
breyer
did
and
particularly
footnote
4
of
the
reply
brief,
which
i
understood
to
be
giving
"presents",
for
example
in
this
statute,
a
promotional
meaning
in
light
of
the
other
words
around
it,
"advertises,
promotes"
and
simply
telling
your...
you
know,
your
neighbor,
i
got
this,
what
should
i
do
about
it,
isn't
promotional.
it
may
be
in
a
technical
term
"presents",
but
it's
not
promotional.
and,
again,
i
understood
your
brief
to
suggest
that
you
have
to
interpret
all
of
those
words
in
an
advertising,
soliciting
sense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
understanding
was
not
that
it
was
limited
to
commercial
speech.
that
was
clear
from
the
footnote
that
i
cited.
but
that
"presents"
was
limited
to
promotional
activity.
it's
one
thing
to
present
and
say
either
whether
to
law
enforcement
or
your
neighbor;
it's
another
thing
to
promote
the
child
pornography.
and
i
thought
your
brief
was
adopting
a
limited
construction
of
words
like
"presents"
that
would
cover
only
promotional
activity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
lost...
in
your
answer,
i
lost
a
negative
or
something.
are
you
saying
that
this
type
of
activity
frequently
occurs
or
infrequently
occurs?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
diaz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there's
a
difference,
isn't
there,
between
beliefs
and
thoughts
about...
what,
the
legality
of
a
particular
type
of
pornography
or
something
like
that,
and
a
factual
matter?
i
thought
this
was
child
pornography?
saying
this
regulates
thoughts
and
beliefs,
those
are
two
quite
different
questions,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
an
entirely
different
thing
to
say
that
this
car
is
a
great
car
and
it
turns
out
not
to
be
a
great
car,
and
to
say
what
you
have
is
either...
is
not...
is
child
pornography
when,
in
fact,
it's
not.
those
are
two
different
things.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
statute
has
an
objective
component.
to
the
objective
observer,
it
must
reasonably
cause
them
to
believe
that
it's
actually
child
pornography.
so
that...
that
would
be...
that
would
prevent
sort
of
the
vague
puffery
that
you're
talking
about
from
being
covered
while
still
covering
something
that
satisfies
both
the
subjective
and
objective
test.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
that
is
responsive
to
justice
kennedy's
point.
you
wouldn't
be
carving
it
out
of
the
first
amendment.
you
would
be
saying
we're
going
to
treat
this
area
like
other
areas,
which
would
say
that
whoever
is
challenging
it
has
to
show
that
they're
a
problematic
case.
in
other
words,
your
client
is
relying...
he
didn't
produce
lolita.
you're
relying
on
the
effect
on
other
people,
and
that
is
what
our
overbreadth
doctrine
allows,
if
there's
a
substantial
amount
of
speech
that's
protected.
and
what
i
understood
the
question
to
suggest
is
that
we
would
wait
basically
for
as-applied
challenges
when
lolita
is
being
prosecuted
and
we
would
hear
from
them,
but
not
in
your
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
the
boundary
between
what
is...
what
should
be
protected
in
relation
to
what's
unprotected.
so
what's
the
ratio
between
legitimate
films
like
lolita
and
illegitimate
child
pornography?
in
other
words,
is,
in
fact,
the
protected
material
substantial
in
relation
to
the
law's
legitimate
sweep?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
diaz.
general
clement,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general,
the
case
is
submitted.
