justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if
you
call
up
your
neighbor
and
say
god,
i
got
this
disgusting
child
porn
in
the
mail?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
have
a
problem
not
just
with
the
presenting,
not
just
with
the
pandering
of
it.
you
have
a
problem
with
the
mere
possession
of
it.
you
have
to
find
some
exception
for
that
anyway.
you
have
to
find
some
as-applied
challenge
exception
for
the
mere
possession
of
it,
even
if
you
don't
pander
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
use
a
seven
year
old
for
the
objective
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
would
use
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--reasonable
adult,
i
had
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
just
good
honest
liars,
right?
i
had
thought
that
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
was
to
protect
speech
that
had
some
value,
and
that
the
reason
obscenity
is
excluded
entirely
from
first
amendment
protection
is
that
it
has
no
redeeming
social
value.
what
social
value
do
you
find
in
being
able
to
lie
about
the
content
of
what
you're
offering
to
somebody
else?
you
say
somehow
if
you're
lying
about
it,
oh,
well,
then
the
first
amendment
protects
that.
i
would
think
if
you're
lying
about
it,
it
is
clearer
than
ever
the
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
it.
there
is
no
social
value
in
protecting
lies.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
depends
on
what
they're
lying
about.
if
they're
lying
about
the
value
of
what
they're
selling,
you
know,
it's
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
what
social
value
are
we
protecting
here,
by
protecting
the
lie
about
whether
this
thing
that
really
isn't
child
pornography
is?
what...
why
would
we
want
to
protect
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
complaining
about
the
degree
of
the
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
seem
to
think
we
are
punishing
the
lying.
i
don't
read
the
statute
as
punishing
the
lying.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
be
punished
even
if
it
were
true.
what
is
being
punished
is
the
pandering.
you
are
the
one
that's
bringing
in
the
lying
example.
you
say,
my
goodness,
even
if
the
pandering
is
a
lie,
pandering
is
pandering.
and
i
don't
see
why
there
is
some
special
protection
against
pandering
when
in
addition
to
pandering,
you're
lying.
maybe
you
ought
to
get
extra
penalty.
[laughter]
but,
in
fact,
the
statute
does
not
provide
extra
penalty.
it
just
provides
a
penalty
for
pandering.
and
i
don't
know
why
it's
a
good
defense
to
that
to
say,
oh,
i
was
actually
lying.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
of
those
verbs
only
become
pandering
when
they
are
attached
to
explicit
sexual
material.
when
you
promote
explicit
sex,
you
are
pandering.
i
mean,
the
word
pandering
does
have
a
sexual
connotation.
i...
i
think...
i
had
thought
it
was
accepted
that
we
have
here
a
statute
that's
directed
against
pandering.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
it
lessen?
i
assume
whatever
you
put
in
an
appendix,
saying
all
these
other
situations
that
are
not
before
us
are
not
covered.
isn't
that
the
most
blatant
dictum?
but...
but...
and,
of
course,
we're
not
bound
in
later
cases
by
our
dicta.
but
come
to
think
of
it,
i
guess
the
whole
doctrine
of
overbreadth
rests
upon
dictum,
doesn't
it?
it...
it
rests
upon
our
determination
in
this
case,
which
involves
somebody
who
undoubtedly
was
selling
child
porn,
and
a
horrible
kind
of
child
porn...
we
say
in
this
case,
oh,
we
can...
we
can
contemplate
other
cases,
where
we
would
not
hold
the
person
guilty.
that
is
all
dictum,
too,
isn't
it?
so
i
guess
the
whole
doctrine
is...
is
based
on
dictum.
so
we
may
as
well
put
it
in
all
an
appendix.
let's
put
our
dictum
in
an
appendix.
i
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
congress
has
sought
in
recent
years
to
legislate
against
the
increasing
flow
of
child
pornography,
that
is
pornography
using
child
subjects,
although
obscenity
has
no
first
amendment
protection,
pornography
does,
the
difference
between
the
two,
you
know
it
when
you
see
it.
the
task
of
--
of
controlling
child
pornography
--
child
pornography
can
be
constitutionally
proscribed,
that
is
the
use
of
children
for
production
of
pornographic
material,
but
the
task
of
--
of
preventing
it
is
difficult
because
modern
imaging
techniques
make
it
almost
impossible
to
prove
that
what
appears
on
the
screen
is
an
actual
child
rather
than
a
technological
creation.
four
terms
ago,
in
ashcroft
versus
free
speech
coalition,
we
held
that
the
first
amendment
was
violated
by
a
provision
of
the
child
pornography
protection
act
of
1996
which
criminalized
the
possession
of
material
that
had
been
pandered
as
child
pornography,
even
if
the
material
was
not
actually
child
pornography,
we
said
that
was
unconstitutional.
in
response,
congress
enacted
in
2003,
a
new
statute
that
punishes,
not
the
possession
of
child
pornography,
but
the
pandering
or
solicitation
of
material
as
child
pornography,
even
if
the
material
is
not
child
pornography
and
indeed,
even
if
no
material
exists
at
all.
in
april
2004,
respondent,
michael
williams,
was
arrested
after
he
posted
a
link
in
an
internet
chat
room
to
pornographic
images
of
young
children.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
violation
of
the
new
statute,
but
reserved
the
right
to
challenge
its
constitutionality.
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed
his
conviction,
finding
that
the
statute
was
overbroad
and
impermissibly
vague.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
we
hold
that
the
statute
is
neither
overbroad
nor
permissibly
--
impermissibly
vague.
a
statute
is
unconstitutionally,
overbroad
if
it
criminalizes
a
substantial
amount
of
constitutionally
protected
activity.
the
first
step
in
overbreathe
analysis
is
obviously
to
determine
what
it
is
that
the
statute
proscribes,
we
can't
determine
whether
it
reaches
a
substantial
amount
of
protected
activity
without
first
knowing
what
it
covers.
the
statute
in
this
case
punishes
"any
person
who
knowingly
advertises,
promotes,
presents,
distributes
or
solicits
any
material
or
purported
material
in
a
manner
that
reflects
the
belief
or
that
is
intended
to
cause
another
to
believe
that
the
material
or
purported
material
is
or
contains
child
pornography."
child
pornography
under
the
statute
includes
both
illegally
obscene
images,
obscenity
can
be
proscribed
even
if
it
doesn’t
involve
children,
whether
real
or
virtual
of
children
engaged
in
specified
sexual
conduct
and
it
includes
pornographic
images
of
real
children
engaged
in
such
conduct.
these
categories
precisely
track
the
types
of
sexually
explicit
images
that
we
have
held
are
constitutionally
proscribable.
five
additional
features
of
the
statute
bear
mention.
first,
the
placement
of
the
word
"knowingly
indicates
the
statute”
and
includes
a
scienter
requirement
for
every
element.
second,
the
statute’s
key
verbs
“advertises,
promotes,
presents,
distributes
or
solicits”
are
reasonably
read
to
have
transactional
connotations.
that
is
to
say,
the
statute
penalizes
speech
that
accompanies
or
seeks
to
induce
a
transfer
of
child
pornography
from
one
person
to
another.
the
transactions
need
not
be
commercial
however
and
the
transfer
can
be
for
free.
third,
the
phrase
"in
a
manner
that
reflects
the
belief"
reflect
--
requires
both
that
a
defendant
have
a
subjective
belief
that
the
material
is
child
pornography
and
that
his
statements
or
actions
objectively
convey
that
belief
to
the
listener.
fourth,
the
phrase
"in
a
manner
that
is
intended
to
cause
another
to
believe"
requires
that
a
defendant
subjectively
intend
to
make
the
listener
believe
that
the
material
is
child
pornography
and
–
and
last,
the
sexual
conduct
alleged
to
be
depicted
in
the
material
must
reach
a
high
level
of
explicitness.
we
conclude
that
the
statute
is
not
overbroad.
it
criminalizes
--
only
offers
to
provide
or
requests
to
obtain
child
pornography.
that
is
to
say,
it
punishes
speech
seeking
to
conclude
illegal
transactions.
such
speech
--
such
speech
is
categorically
excluded
from
first
amendment
protection.
the
eleventh
circuit
believed
that
only
commercial
offers
to
engage
in
--
in
illegal
transactions
are
categorically
excluded,
but
that
is
wrong.
free
distribution
of
contraband
has
no
more
social
value
than
market
exchanges
of
contraband.
the
eleventh
circuit
further
believed
that
the
fact
that
no
child
pornography
need
exist
to
trigger
the
statute,
rendered
it
unconstitutional.
but
the
fact
that
a
defendant
is
mistaken
about
the
contraband
nature
--
nature
of
what
he
seeks
to
distribute
or
what
he
seeks
to
acquire,
does
not
immunize
him
from
criminal
punishment.
factual
impossibility
is
not
a
defense
to
inchoate
crimes.
for
example,
congress
may
punish
one
who
sells
what
he
believes
to
be
classified
information
even
if
he
is
mistaken
concerning
its
classified
character.
we
see
no
justification
for
creating
an
exemption
to
that
general
principle
of
the
law,
when
the
underlying
material
unbeknown
to
one
or
both
of
the
parties
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
respondent
and
amici
raised
a
host
of
fanciful
hypotheticals
to
try
to
demonstrate
that
the
statute
is
overbroad,
but
none
of
them
show
that
the
statute
reaches
a
substantial
amount
of
protected
speech.
we
also
conclude
that
the
statute
is
not
impermissibly
vague.
this
is
not
a
statute
that
punishes
annoying
or
indecent
conduct,
terms
that
without
statutory
definitions
or
narrowing
context
require
subjective
judgments.
each
of
the
elements
of
the
statute
is
a
clear
question
of
fact.
the
eleventh
circuit
thought
it
problematic
that
some
of
those
facts
relate
to
the
defendant's
intent
and
belief,
but
juries
pass
on
questions
of
intent
and
belief
all
the
time.
what
renders
a
statute
vague
is
not
the
difficulty
of
proving
the
incriminating
fact,
but
rather
the
indeterminacy
of
precisely
what
the
incriminating
fact
is.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
