mr.
richard
j.
diaz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
pandering
provision
of
the
protect
act
carries
a
5-year
mandatory
minimum
prison
term
and
a
possible
20-year
prison
term,
has
no
affirmative
defense
provision.
it
is
unconstitutionally
vague
and
overbroad,
because
on
its
face
it
captures
protected
speech
about
materials.
and
it
captures
speech
about
materials
that
may
not
even
in
fact
exist.
the
language
"in
a
manner
that
reflects
the
belief,
or
that
is
intended
to
cause
another
to
believe.
"
does
not
sufficiently
define
prohibited
conduct
giving
law
enforcement
unfettered
discretion
to
subjectively
enforce
the
statute.
in
essence,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
held,
the
determination
does
not
rest
on
what
materials
contain,
but
rather
on
how
someone
conveys
his
or
her
impression
about
what
the
materials
convey.
in
other
words,
this
statute,
in
short,
punishes
thought,
beliefs,
expressions,
and
opinions.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
one
of
the
problems
with
the
statute,
and
just
another
example
of
what
we've
been
talking
about
here...
[amazondotcom]
and
netflix...
there's
also,
for
example,
a
series
of
photography
that
we've
seen
nationwide
by
famous
photographers
of
minors
or
children,
photographers
of
child
modeling
agencies--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--if--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--correct.
the
problem
is
if
i
were
to
take
anything
such
as
the
cnn
video
of
an
actual
sexually
explicit
conduct
involving
a
minor,
or
if
i
were
to
take
any
of
these
films,
if
i
were
to
start
an
internet
blog
and
say,
look,
this
film
contains
sexual
conduct
of
a
minor,
and
i
think
we
should
do
something
about
this,
i
think
we
should
form
a
coalition
or
i
think
we
should
boycott
it.
and
i
am
conveying
the
belief.
i
am
intending
to
make
you
believe
that
what
those
materials
contain,
albeit
what
they
really
have
or
what
they
really
are,
is
illegal.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
protected.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
if
the
material
substantively
violates
the
statute,
then
the
mere
possession
of
them
is
illegal.
and
there
is
a
defense
under
the
possession
part
of
the
statute
for
presenting
them
to
the
police
within
a
certain
amount
of
time
and
within
a
certain
manner
of
your
conduct.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
the
possession
of
the
materials.
we're
talking
about
the
expression
about
what
the
materials
contain.
even
if
you're
wrong
about
it,
even
if
you're
mistaken,
even
if
you're
lying
about
it,
even
if
you're
bragging
about
it,
the
traditional
prankster,
as
senator
leahy
said
in
the
congressional
report,
one
of
the
things
we're
concerned
about
with
the
statute
is
that
it
could
capture
people
who
are
expressing
salacious
thoughts.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
one
of
the
problems
with
the
issue
of
social
value
and
lying
is
that
we
don't
put
people
in
jail
for
5
mandatory
minimum
years
or
20
years
in
prison
for
simply
lying.
we
simply
don't
do
that.
i
agree
with
your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--and
i
agree
with
your
honor...
justice
scalia,
that
we
have
a
slew
of
state
statutes
particularly
in
the
area
of
consumer
fraud.
if
i
pretend
to
have
something
that's
illegal
and
offer
it
to
you
or
promote
it
to
you
or
advertise
it
to
you,
and
i
have
nothing,
then
that
person
can
and
should
be
punished,
but
not
for...
not
under
this
statute.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
we
necessarily
do
not
want
to
protect
that.
but
we
don't
punish
it
with
a
5
to
20-year
prison
sentence.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
it
is
not
just
the
degree
of
the
penalty.
the
statute
doesn't
just
cover
liars,
justice
scalia.
it
also
covers
people
who
are
mistaken.
it
covers
exaggeration.
it
covers
puffing.
for
example,
if
i
have
a
legitimate
clean
videotape
that
i
want
to
duplicate,
i
may
be
violating
trademark
or
other
patent
laws
or
whatnot,
but
i
want
to
take
this
and
i
want
to
sell
it
in
the
marketplace
over
the
internet.
and
i
exaggerate
by
the
words
that
i
choose
to
use
in
promoting
that
tape
for
commercial
purpose,
for
example,
and
i'm
exaggerating.
that
person
if
they
market
the
materials
in
a
way
that
causes
the
potential
buyers
to
believe
that
what
it
has
is
illegal,
even
if
i'm
just
puffing
or
bragging,
the
car
salesman
in
a
car
sales
situation,
we
don't
like
it--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--i
think
it
could
be
very...
in
the
real
world
i
think
it
is
very
easy
for
a
person
to
puff
about
what
materials
contain
that
are
lawful
to
possess,
such
as
titanic,
lolita
or
american
beauty.
and
all
you
would
have
to
say
is,
put
a
trailer
on
it
and
say
that
this
is
hot
graphic
teen
sex,
and
you're
puffing
about
what
it
really
is.
we
know...
you
know
it
really
isn't.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
if
a
person
listens
to
or
hears
somebody
describe
titanic,
lolita,
american
beauty
or
any
of
the
films
of
the
like
as
hot
graphic
teen
sex,
i
think
a
reasonable
ordinary
person
could
believe
that
what
is
being
portrayed
is
proscribed
material,
even
if
it
doesn't
exist,
or
even
if
it
exists
and
is
protected
under
ferber.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
i
don't
think...
i
think
the
statute
covers
people
who
brag,
people
who
puff,
people
who
tell
the
truth,
who--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--but
the
problem
with
the
statute,
while
it
does
capture
pandering
and
illegal
conduct,
it
goes
beyond
that
and
captures
a
slew
of
innocent
conduct
which
we
discussed
this
morning
in
the
examples--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--the
best
and
realistic
example
would
be
any
person,
not
necessarily
[amazondotcom]
or
netflix,
it
could
be
a
private
citizen.
it
could
be
a
religious
leader
of
a
religious
group,
regardless
of
what
type
of
religion
we're
talking
about.
it
could
be
any
of
those
people--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--who
look
at
the...
the
nan
goldin
pictures,
who
look
at
lolita,
traffic
and
all
of
these
other
movies
and
harbor
a
belief
that
it
is
obscene,
which
is
one
of
the
two
types
of
materials
that's
proscribed.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
my
opinion,
justice
breyer,
is
that
could
be
done.
we
could
put
a
dozen
or
two
dozen
or
three
dozen,
an
exponential
number
of
examples,
that
would
be
excluded.
essentially
we
would
be
writing
an
affirmative
defense
into
the
statute
or
an
absolute
defense
that
would
prohibit
even
the
prosecution.
the
concern
that
that
raises
for
me,
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
is
you're
still
going
to
have
a
chilling
on
free
speech.
there
are
still
going
to
be
people
out
there
who
are
not
covered
by
one
of
these
examples
who
we
haven't
thought
of,
and
that
person
is
going
to
be
afraid
to
express
opinions.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
the
court
can
certainly
do
that,
justice
kennedy.
essentially,
though,
i
think
what
the
court
would
be
doing
would
be
taking
the
four
areas
of
speech
that
have
been
taken
out
of
the
first
amendment
protection,
which
is
defamation,
the
fighting
words
under
brandenburg,
miller,
which
is
obscenity,
and
the
additional
extension
of
ferber.
now
what
we
would
be
doing
is
carving
yet
another
area
of
speech
out
of
the
first
amendment,
and
we're
just
going
to
continue
chipping
it
away
and
chipping
it
away.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
that
certainly
could
be
done,
mr.
chief
justice.
again,
and
as
i
suggested
earlier,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
we're
not
talking
about
anything
less
than
a
criminal
statute,
a
criminal
statute
that
implicates
the
first
amendment,
freedom
and
thought
which
this
court
since
its
very
existence
has
said
we
have
to
honor
and
respect,
even
if
people
are
thinking
about
nasty
or
dirty
things.
that's
what
this
country
is
based
upon,
and
the
grave
concern
if
we're
going
to
do
it
on
an
as-applied
challenge,
is
people
who
might
be
afraid
to
express
their
views
about
whether
this
is
or
is
not
obscene.
it's
is
the
parent
of
a
neighborhood
group
who
see
a
movie
and
wants
to
tell
everybody
about
it
and
say,
look--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--i
believe
that
that
would
more
narrowly
tailor
the
statute,
but
i
don't
believe,
justice
alito,
that
it
would
solve
the
problem
of
chilling
speech.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
that...
it
could
be,
and
that
would
depend.
i
agree
with
your
honor,
justice
souter,
that
we
have
this
world
or
this
universe
of
overbroad
speech,
and
the
appendix
would
shrink
it
and
make
it
narrower.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
with
respect,
my
initial
response
to
justice
breyer's
suggestion,
if
you
will,
was
the
same
as
your
honor,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
know
that
creating
an
appendix
of
examples
is
going
to
cure
the
problem.
i
do
concede
that
it
would
lessen
the
problem.
we
would...
we
would--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--in
answer
to
your
honor's
question
or
comment...--
[laughter]
--the...
i
agree
that
the
issue
of
overbreadth
is
something
where
we're
looking
at
boundaries.
and
that's
really
what
i
think
the
court
does
in
a
situation
of
overbreadth
analysis.
you
look
at
the
boundaries.
how
much...
how
far
we've
gone
outside
of
the
boundaries
of
what
is
protected.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
the
problem
is
we
don't
have
an
empirical
answer,
a
mathematic
answer
to
that
question.
what
we
do
know
is
that
films
like
lolita,
american
beauty,
and
whatnot,
which
if
presented
in
a
certain
way
can
bring
people
under
the
coverage
of
the
statute,
have
received
acclaim
around
the
world,
i
mean
all
sorts
of
academy
awards.
they're
seen
time
and
time
again.
they're
seen
on
netflix.
they're
seen
on
cable
tv.
to
this
day,
some
of
these
movies
have
been
around
for
30
years.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
my
response,
justice
breyer,
is
that
if
you
take
the
word
"present"
and
you
give
it
the
meaning
that
it
was
given
in
ferber,
you
make
the
statute
narrower.
you
make
it...
bring
it
into
more
of
a
constitutionally
acceptable
realm,
but
i
respectfully
do
not
believe
that
it
cures
the
entire
problem,
and
my
basis
for
saying
that
the
question
of
justice
souter
of
the
solicitor
general.
you
know...
the
concern
is,
when
you
don't
have
lawyers
who
understand
these
hypertechnical
meanings
that
the
court
is
going
to
give
and
the
interpretations
we're
going
to
put
on
them--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--i
think
it
would,
but
concededly
to
a
lesser
degree,
because
once
you
make
it
clear
as
to
what
matters
are
not
covered
by
the
statute,
it
makes
it
easier
for
people
to
conform
their
conduct
and
their
words
accordingly.
the
concern
that
i
have
is
that
it
still
chills
a...
it
still
chills
free
speech.
if
a
person
looks
at
an
appendix
or
looks
at
the
rationale
in
the
court's
opinion
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--certainly,
and
i
go
back
to
the
question
of
justice
breyer
which
is
adolescents,
17
year
olds,
18
year
olds,
who
like
to
look
at
these
types
of
materials
and
one
of
them
could
simply
say
to
another
over
the
internet,
you
know,
do
you
think
we
can
get
some
hardcore
child
porn?
he's
soliciting
child
porn
from
another
person,
and
that
individual,
that
17
year
old
kid,
who's
fantasizing
or
experimenting
with
his
own
sexuality,
can
go
to
jail
for
5
to
20
years.
and
we
see
that
in
everyday
america,
in
high
schools
around
the
country.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
if
he's
soliciting
materials
under
sub
(i)
or
sub
(ii)
of
the
statute,
of
the
pandering
provision
of
the
statute,
yes.
that
person
can
be
prohibited.
excuse
me,
that
person
can
be
prosecuted.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
your
honor,
i
cannot
cite
a
specific
example,
but
i
can
certainly
tell
your
honor
this...
prosecutions
from
1997
to
2004
have
increased
over
452
percent.
the
conviction
rate--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--exactly.
and
the
conviction
rate
is
99.6
percent.
and--
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
--"can
you
get
me".
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
"can
you
get
me".
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
first
of
all,
it
may
not
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
but
it
shouldn't
be
captured
by
this
statute,
which
puts
that
17
year
old
in
jail
for
5
to
20
years.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
i
don't
think
that
it
is
necessarily
not
covered
by
the
first
amendment.
i
think
certainly
the
first
amendment...
and
this
court
has
held,
that
we
protect
salacious
thoughts,
salacious
ideas.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
i
think
the
first
amendment
is
implied,
but
i
don't
think
it
becomes
criminal
conduct
until
you
get
to
either
an
attempt,
solicitation,
or
a
conspiracy.
you
have
to
do
more
than
just
say
i
would
like
to
get
it
or
can
you
get
it
for
me,
to
be
guilty
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
right.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
to
fall
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
and
another
example
that
comes
to
mind
is
a
person
has
material
which
they
believe
is
child
pornography.
they
give
it
to
somebody
else,
such
as
lolita,
for
an
opinion
and
they
present
to
it
that
person.
one
of
the
biggest
problems
or
one
of
the
biggest...
the
verb
that's
most
objectionable
in
the
statute
is
"present",
because
it
does
not
have
to
have
any
commercial
requirement.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
solicitation
is
a
crime
in
and
of
itself,
and
talking
about
or
expressing
a
desire
to
obtain
is
not...
doesn't
quite
go
to
the
level
of
solicitation
or
intent,
where
there
has
to
be
a
proximity
in
time,
in
immediacy,
and
a
certain
geographical
proximity
between
the
words
and
the
comment
that
you
intend.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
well,
there's
"solicit"
and
there's
also
"present".
it
works
in
both
directions.
mr.
richard
j.
diaz
correct.
i
agree.
thank
you,
your
honor.
