justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
ferber
confined
the
meaning
of
child
pornography
to,
i
think,
the
greater
extent
than
this
statute
does.
it
talks
about
artistic
value,
but
this...
there
were
several
examples
given
in
the
briefs.
one
was
this
film
depicts
12
year
old
child
having
sexual
relations
with
an
old
man.
now
that
statement
could
be
perceived
as
this
film
shows
child
pornography.
just
that
statement.
but
it's
a
truthful
statement
about
lolita,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
if
you
say...
if
you
say,
12
year
old
child...
this
film
shows
a
12
year
old
child,
and
it
doesn't
tell
you
that
the
person
who's
playing
a
12
year
old
is
a
young
adult?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
just
wanted
to
clarify
the
footnote
to
which
the
chief
referred,
that
footnote
4
in
your
reply
brief.
it
says,
to
the
contrary,
the
government's
brief
expressly
acknowledges
that
the
statute's
proscription
encompasses
noncommercial
speech.
so
i
think
justice
breyer's
suggestion
that
you
said
in
your
brief,
that
the
statute
is
limited
to
commercial
speech,
is
something
that
you...
say,
no,
that's
not
so;
we
say
it
encompasses
noncommercial
speech.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though...
even
though
what
you
are,
in
fact,
showing
or
presenting
does
not
fit
the
definition?
even
if
what
you're
showing...
you
say,
have
i
got
some
hot
child
porn
and
here
it
is,
and
the
"it"
is...
is...
an
adult
pretending
to
be
a
child,
or
a
virtual
image.
so
the...
the
problem
is
not
an
accurate
representation
that
this
is
hardcore
porn,
and
it
is,
but
saying,
have
i
got
the
real
stuff,
but
what
you
present
is
not
at
all
the
real
stuff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could...
just
one
question.
you
mentioned
a
film,
17
year
old
playing
that
part.
but
you
said
that
wouldn't
be...
that
wouldn't
fit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
statute
says
simulated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
"present"?
the
word
"pandering"
itself
is
not
used
in
the
statute.
it
uses
a
lot
of
words,
"promote"
and
"advertise"...
well,
maybe
that's
just
redundant.
i
guess
that
would
be
the
government's
position...
but
"present",
"distribute"...
what
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
rewrite...
and
essentially
rewriting
the
law,
and
that's
my
question
about
this
technique
that
justice
breyer
has
proposed.
this
court
is
not
generally
in
the
business
of
writing
appendices
that
say
well,
the
statute
couldn't
apply
in
this
situation,
and
it
couldn't
apply
and
as
long
as
we
put
those
contours
around
it.
certainly
the
court
could
write
an
opinion
that
would
inform
congress
why
this
particular
statute
as
written
is
overbroad,
and
explain
what
kind
of
statute
wouldn't
be
overbroad.
but
for
the
court
itself,
i
think
that
that...
i
don't
know
any
instance
in
which
we
have
provided
that
kind
of
appendix
that
said
things
that
are
like
traffic,
they're
okay,
and
things
that
are
like
something
else
are
not
okay.
i
don't
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
see
them
getting
prosecuted
in
any
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
you
have
there
been
such
cases?
a
lot
of
states
have
pandering
laws
now,
and
is
the
case
that
you
posit
a
case
that
has
occurred
in
any
of
those
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
that's
because
the
quantity
of
material
has
increased.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
only
thing
that
limits
the
statute
is
the
first
amendment.
what
else...
you
say
it
may
not
be
covered
by
the
first
amendment.
what
else
gives
you
a
right
to
challenge
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
is
it
different
it
would
be
strange
to
trust
out
the
document...
the
doctrine
as
i...
as
i
understand
it
is
what
we
relied
on
when
we
had
the
predecessor
to
this
statute
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
that
occur
in...
free
speech
coalition.
