supposing
the
underlying
movie
is
a
depiction
of
atrocities
being
committed
in
some
foreign
country,
in
a
war
zone
or
something,
by
soldiers
who
rape
young
kids.
and
so
it
comes
within
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute.
and
if
one
said
i'd
like
to
take
a
look
at
this
movie,
wouldn't
that
be
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
movie
itself
would
be
pictures
of
soldiers
raping
young
kids.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
news...
i'm
thinking
of
the
news
reel...
somebody
makes
as
exhibit
at
a
war
crimes
trial,
or
something
like
that...
sees
this
actually
happening.
now,
as
i
understand
the
language
of
the
statute,
if
the
person
who
had
that
film
described
it
to
someone
he
wanted
to
send
it
to,
he
would
violate
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are.

stevens
depiction
of
a
war
crime
taking
place?
he
saw
that
on
camera...
that
would
be
a
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
agree
i
guess
that
there
are
some...
there
would
be
some
valid
as-applied
challenges
to
this
statute.
