justice
david
h.
souter
well
what
if
an
individual
received
actual
child
pornography
in
the
mail
that
had
not
been
solicited.
and
he
calls
the
chief
of
police
in
town
and
says
i
just
opened
my
mail,
and
this
envelope
is
full
of
child
porn.
and
he's
right.
i
mean,
there
are
no
body
doubles.
this
is
the
real
thing
in
here.
he
has
presented
child
pornography
to
that
chief
of
police
and
he's
violated
the
statute,
hasn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
no,
but
you
say
no
because
we
won't
enforce
it
that
way.
but
the...
but
the
objective
component
and
the
subjective
component
in
my
example
are
both
satisfied.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
fine,
but
before
you
get
to
that
point,
you
have...
there's
still
an
indictable
offense.
you
don't
prevent...
you
don't
present
affirmative
defenses
until
you're
already
indicted.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
ban
on
possession
is
not
the
real
problem
because,
under
a
normal
possession
statute,
you
would
indeed
have
a
problem
not
merely
in
terms
of...
that
could
be
raised
not
merely
by
affirmative
defense
but
as
an
element
of
the
statute.
if
the
possession
is
merely
a
matter
of
happenstance,
there's
an
intent
problem
and
presumably
there's
no...
there's
no
offense.
there's
no
knowing
offense
in
acquiring
material
for
the
possession.
but
in
the
pandering
statute,
what
we've
got
here
is
there
is...
as
you
put
it
earlier,
there
is
an
understanding
which
happens
to
be
correct,
objectively
correct,
that
there
is
child
porn,
and
there
is
a
very
clear
intent
to
convey
that
message
by
way
of
presenting
this
material
to
a
third
party,
in
this
case
the
police.
so
i
think
this
is
not
merely
comparable
to
the
problem
of
haphazard
possession.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
would
you
do
it
in
the
case...
you
mentioned
that
if
there
is
not
actual
child
porn
shown,
and
there
is
a
truthful
or
honest
statement
about
it,
that
there
is
nothing
to
worry
about.
but
what
about
the
movie
reviewer
who
is
reviewing
the
latest
re-release
or
something
of
the
"lolita"
film
and
says
this
depicts
sexual
activity
with
a
minor?
that
statement
is
true.
it
would
be
taken
by
some
naive
people
as
saying
boy,
this
is
what
it
shows,
the
real
thing.
that
is
a
truthful
statement.
and
yet,
it
would
still
fall
within
the
prohibition
of
the
statute.
as
i
understand
your
position,
the
only
way
that
statement
would
be
truthful
in
a
way
that
would
excuse
would
be
if
the
reviewer
said
this
depicts
sexual
activity
with
a
minor,
but
of
course
the
actor
wasn't
really
a
minor.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
you
are
17
years
old
and
you
haven't
gone
to
law
school
and
you
haven't
read
these
cases?
you
may
very
well
assume
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
we
use...
wouldn't
we
use
a
reasonable
personal
of
the
sort
who
goes
to
movies?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
would
suppose
my
17
year
old,
non-law-school
graduate
would
be
within
the
ambit
of
the
reasonable
class.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
problem
the
problem
of
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
he
said,
you
know,
what
if
we
have
this
appendix
and
we
list...
i
forget
what
he
said,
three
dozen
examples
that
the
solicitor
general
says
wouldn't
be
covered
and
that
sounds
fine
to
us.
your
answer
was
well,
there
would
still
be
some
examples
not
covered.
but
isn't...
isn't
the
answer
to
that
that
there
would
be
some
conceivable
overbreadth,
i
suppose,
no
matter
what
the
appendix
said?
somewhere
out
there
there
would
be
an
example
not
covered
that
would
be
the
basis
for
an
as-applied
challenge,
but
there
wouldn't
be
substantial
overbreadth.
and
isn't
that
the
case?
that
if
justice
breyer's
hypo
were
in
fact
the
decision
of
this
case,
there
wouldn't
be
a
fair
argument
that
there
is
any
substantial
overbreadth
left
to
the
statute,
isn't
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
answer
to
that
you
may
still
have
some
overbreadth
left,
but
it's
not
substantial?
most
17
year
olds
are,
in
fact,
going
to
realize
that
the
real
thing
is
not
going
on
in,
you
know,
the
lolita
movie.
and
if
we
accept
that
as
a
factual
proposition,
which
was
the
solicitor
general's
answer,
and
if
we
also
accept,
not
by
way
of
appendix
but
way
of
rationale
in
the
opinion,
that
these
various
activities
have
got
to
be
given
an
essentially
commercial
or
quasi-commercial
character,
so
that
they
don't
pick
up
the
conversations
with
the
neighbor,
then
that's
simply
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
that
could
be
part
of
our
rationale.
if
we
accept
the
factual
proposition
about
what
reasonable
viewers
are
likely
to
know,
and
we
engage
in
that
kind
of
interpretation
following
the
solicitor
general's
view
of
how
this
serial
list
of
activities
should
be
construed,
don't
we
eliminate
the
possibility...
wouldn't
we
eliminate
the
possibility
of
substantial
overbreadth?
some
things
may
get
by.
there
may
still
be
legitimate
applied
challenges,
but
substantial
overbreadth,
would
that
be
left?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
can,
but
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
class
of
activities
that
would
not
be,
in
effect,
insulated
from
indictment
by
these
two
steps
in
the
opinion,
that
would
be
of
substantial
character?
