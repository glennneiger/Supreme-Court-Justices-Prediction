g.

indeed,
it
is
covered
by
the
statute
because
i
read
your
brief
as
saying
that
the
statute
applies
only
in
instances
where
either
you're
trying
to
sell
it
or
trade
it.
that
is
what
you're
trying...
now
it
seems
to
me
a
different
matter
if
it's
covering
only...
covering
as
well
instances
where
somebody's
simply
showing
it
to
someone
else
to
show
him
what
he
got
in
the
mail.
well,
i'd
appreciate
clarity
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
covered
by
the
statute,
what
you're
going
to
do
then
is
suddenly
criminalize
what
could
be
an
awful
lot
of
activity
that
goes
on
in
schools
all
over
the
place
and
somebody
has...
they
think
it's
funny,
and
maybe
it
isn't
funny,
but
they
think
it
is
and
it's
kind
of
school-boy
behavior,
and
they're
showing
this
stuff
around,
not
totally
certain
what
it
is.
suddenly
that
can
become
a
federal
crime.
seems
like
quite
an
extension.
and
i
thought
you'd
written
your
way
out
of
that
problem,
and
now
i
think
you
haven't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
take
it
as
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
take
it
as
that.
i
would
say
looking
and
presenting
to
schoolmates
dirty
pictures
is
a
fairly
common
adolescent
and
post-adolescent
activity.
and
i
would
suspect
a
very
high-level
percentage
of
that
class
of
people
don't
examine
too
carefully
what
the
age
of
the
individuals
depicted
is,
and
many
might
misrepresent
what
that
age
is.
so
this
sounds
like
a
statute
that
has
enormous
reach,
whereas
previously
i
thought
it
hadn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
none
of
those...
i
mean,
we've
gone
through
this
with
the
solicitor
general.
he
went
through
every
example
in
his
brief
that
you've
been
able
to
produce,
and
he
said
they
aren't
caught
by
the
statute.
what's
wrong
with
what
he
said?
why
isn't
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
photographers,
for
example.
that's
not
child
pornography.
and
if
it
was,
they
would
have
to
act...
if
it
is
child
pornography
under
ferber,
it
isn't
protected.
if
it
isn't
child
pornography
under
ferber,
well,
then
there's
no
problem.
okay.
that's
their
view
of
the
photographers.
and
the
same
with
amazon,
the
same
with
netflix.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
problem
with
ferber,
you
said.
same
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
your
response
to
what
he
said?
it
is
the...
with
possession.
you
possess
these
materials.
what
you
are
trying
to
do
is
take
them
to
the
police
and
stop
them.
under
ferber,
is
that
protected
or
not?
if
it
is
protected,
as
i
think
it
would
be,
so
is
it
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
under
ferber
he's
going
to
go
right
to
jail
because
he
has
them.
i
would
think
it
would
be
protected.
i
can't
imagine
somebody
who
collects,
on
these
sites
where
they
are
molesting
children,
material
to
prevent
children
being
molested
and
presents
it
to
the
proper
authority
is
going
to
be
prosecuted
under
the
new
york
statute
in
ferber.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
we
did
this?
what
would
you
think
about
an
opinion,
and
why,
which
says
the
following?
we
take
every
one
of
those
examples
and
all
the
ones
listed
here
and
put
them
in
appendix
a,
and
the
opinion
says
this
is
the
solicitor
general's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
as
amended,
say
with
the
word
presentment,
which
comes
out
of
promotion
infer,
and
we
think
under
that
interpretation
of
the
statute,
none
of
these
things,
nor
anything
like
them,
could
be
prosecuted.
and
if
so
understood,
we
can
find
no
example,
at
least
none
not
present
in
ferber
itself,
where
this
would
be
overbroad.
therefore,
it
is
constitutional.
i'm
not
saying
that
is
my
view.
i
am
saying
simply
i
want
to
know
your
opinion
about
what
would
be
wrong
with
such
an
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
the
point
of
the...
the
point
of
the
appendix,
which
unfortunately
has
the
failing
of
many
charming
metaphors,
is
that
it
has
acquired
a
life
of
its
own.
[laughter]
it
distracts
from
the
question.
but
it...
as
i
read
the
solicitor
general's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
amended
it,
taking
the
word
"presentment"
from
its
context
in
ferber,
where
it
was
part
of
the
definition
of
promotion,
i
thought
that
was
the
appendix.
at
least,
that's
my
hypothetical
question.
and
so
whether
you
like
appendices
or
don't
like
appendices,
you
could
focus
on
why
isn't
it
the
appendix
i'm
talking
about?
he's
filled
it
with
qualifications
using
the
words
"knowingly,
reasonable",
and
a
context
that
if
it
is
not
purely
commercial,
as
i
understood,
is
at
least
commercial
plus
a
few
things
such
as
bartering.
that
was
really
my
question,
and
you've
come
back
to
american
beauty
and
so
forth,
and
if
there's
one
thing
i
think
his
definition
keeps
out
of
this
discussion,
it
is
american
beauty
and
traffic,
because
i
don't
see
under
his
interpretation
how
anyone
could
conceivably
be
prosecuted
even
if
he's
talking
to
a
group
who
have
never
seen
a
movie.
that
isn't
a
reasonable
group
of
people.
so
what
is
your
response
to
what
he
said?
