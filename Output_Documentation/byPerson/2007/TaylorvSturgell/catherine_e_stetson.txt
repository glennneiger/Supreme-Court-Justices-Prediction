ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
scalia,
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
question
that
you
posed
earlier
regarding
privity
and
what
it
really
means,
because
that's
what
has
given
rise,
i
think,
to
all
of
these
vexing
hypotheticals
and
to
your
concern
about
this
being
nothing
more
than
a
completely
freewheeling,
totality-of-the
circumstances
test.
the
problem,
i
think,
that
you're
confronting
is
that
you
don't
have
the
usual
place
that
you
plant
your
foot
whenever
you
try
to
develop
a
categorical
rule.
you
don't
have
a
statutory
text.
you
don't
have
a
constitutional
text.
this
is
a
federal
common-law
issue;
and,
as
this
court
unanimously
acknowledged
in
1996,
what
our
notions
are
of
privity
are
changing,
and
they
continue
to
change.
in
1942,
when
the
first
restatement
was
issued,
"privity"
was
defined
as
control,
or
successor
in
interest,
or
representation.
in
1982,
when
the
second
restatement
was
issued,
62
category
that
mr.
hallward-driemeier
just
mentioned,
which
we
can
call
"shenanigans".
the
notion
of
privity
is
underpinned
in
every
single
one
of
those
contexts
by
a
couple
of
basic
inquiries,
and
this
is
what
makes
it
something
much
more
confined
than
a
freewheeling,
totality-of-the-circumstances
test.
the
inquiries
are:
what
are
the
relationships
between
these
two
litigants,
these
two
serial
litigants,
and
how
have
they
conducted
themselves
in
this
litigation?
and
this
in
turn,
i
think,
gets
to
the
dialogue
that,
justice
souter,
you
were
having
with
my
colleagues.
your
first
question
was...
posited
the
situation
where
one
plaintiff
sues
and
loses
and
comes
to
another
and
says:
please
try
again
for
me.
that
is
precisely
this
case.
and
we
don't
have
to
get
into--
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
--i
agree
with
you
the
d.c.
circuit
didn't
find
collusion,
looking
at
petitioner's
appendix
17-a
at
two
things:
the
timing
of
the
suit
and
the
sharing
of
discovery.
but
we
don't
need
to
get
into
the
evidence
of
collusion
because
what
the
d.c.
circuit
concluded
as
a
predicate
finding
for
its
close...
relationship
holding
was
that
there
was
a
request
from
mr.
herrick
to
mr.
taylor
to
assist
in
the
repair
of
his
plane.
and
you
can
see
this
play
out
very
tellingly
at
joint
appendix
31
to
32.
if
you
look
there,
this
is
the
motion
to
allow
discovery.
joint
appendix
31
is
where
mr.
taylor
relays
at
length
the
tenth
circuit
argument
and
the
tenth
circuit
ruling.
the
first
full
paragraph
on
joint
appendix
32
begins:
"mr.
herrick
has
now
requested
mr.
taylor
to
assist
in
the
repair
of
his
plane.
"
now,
mr.
herrick,
you
can
see
from
the
first
exhibit
to
fairchild's
summary
judgment
motion
in
district
court,
page
161,
mr.
herrick
has
six
full-time
mechanics.
he
lives
in
jackson
hole.
his
mechanics
work
in
minneapolis.
he
doesn't
need
mr.
taylor,
who
lives
in
iowa,
to
actually,
physically
assist
with
the
repair
of
his
plane.
what
he
needs
is
someone
with
whom
he
doesn't
have
an
extant
employment
relationship,
who
lives
in
a
different
circuit,
to
get
those
documents.
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
two
responses,
your
honor:
the
first
is
that
conclusion
was
precisely
the
conclusion
that
was
drawn
by
the
d.c.
circuit
on
the
close-relationship
point.
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
17-a,
the
conclusion
on
close
relationship
was
predicated
on,
among
other
things,
the
critical
fact
of
the
request
from
mr.
herrick
to
mr.
taylor
to
repair
the
plane.
that
is
what
made--
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
--the
district
court,
in
fact,
held
precisely
that.
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
in
joint
appendix
35-a...
in
petitioner's
appendix
35-a
the
district
court
concluded
as
a
factual
finding
that
there
was
deliberate
maneuvering
based
on
two
things.
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
well,
i'm
going
to
resist
you
slightly,
justice
ginsburg.
i'm
not
sure
that
is
out
of
the
case.
it
is
very
curious.
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
what
the
district
court
found
constituted
collusion
was
identical
interests
and
the
request.
what
the
d.c.
circuit
found
did
not
constitute
collusion
was
the
timing
of
the
foia
action
and
the
sharing
of
discovery.
so
they're
operating
on
the
collusion
front
on
two
completely
parallel
paths.
but
on
the--
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
--the
discussion
that
precedes
the
reviewing
of
the
bidding
references
with
respect
to
the
close-relationship
finding
the
request
from
mr.
herrick
to
mr.
taylor
to
assist
in
the
repair
of
his
plane,
the
request
that
is
featured
in
joint
appendix
32
as
the
preceding
factor
to
the
filing
of
the
foia
action.
and
i
grant
you,
that
does
make
this
case
quite
unique.
it
does
make
it
quite
similar
to
the
1897
case
from
the
the
eighth
circuit,
and
i
think
it
is
quite
telling
that
we
haven't
found
another
analogue.
that
doesn't
mean
that
this
doesn't
fall
well
within
the
wheelhouse
of
privity
cases
that
this
court
is
quite
comfortable
with.
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
well,
it
depends
on...
it
depends
on
a
couple
of
things,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
first
thing
it
depends
on
is
a
finding
that
the
interests
of
the
association
and
of
the
members
is
identical.
not
just
common,
not
just--
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
--right.
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
i
think...
i
think
the
interests
need
to...
to
be
identical.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
enough
just
to
have
a
common
cause.
the
interests
were
found
in
this
case
to
be
identical
because
one
was
literally
factually
derivative
of
the
other.
and
i
want
to
make
a
point
clear
about
the
difference
between
foia
standing
such
as
it
is,
and
the
interest
that's
being
represented
in
this
case.
the
fact
that
mr.
taylor,
after
learning
of
mr.
herrick's
defeat,
decided
to
perfect
his
foia
rights
and
sue
in
federal
court
gave
him
standing.
that
was
all
it
gave
him.
what
it
did
not
do
is
give
him
a
free
pass
from
a
res
judicata
inquiry.
and
justice
scalia
and
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
points
about
foia
not
requiring
a
motive,
that's
absolutely
right
at
the
agency
level.
but
at
the
point
where
a
disappointed
foia
requestor
comes
into
court
and
asks
to
be
heard
on
the
same
claim
representing
somebody
else's
interest,
on
its
face,
at
joint
appendix
32,
that's
the
point
where
the
judicial
doctrine
of
res
judicata
kicks
in.
that's--
ms.
catherine
e.
stetson
--that
is
right.
that
is
absolutely
right.
the
reason
that
mr.
taylor
is
barred
is
not
just
because
he's
asking
for
these
same
documents.
these
are
incredibly
unusual
documents;
they
don't
have
great
public
appeal;
but
the
reason
he's
barred
is
because
mr.
herrick
requested
his
assistance
in
the
repair
of
the
airplane.
mr.
taylor
sought
the
same
documents
for
exactly
the
same
reason
to
be
used
to
exactly
the
same
end
purpose.
that
should...
i
think...
give
the
petitioner
a
great
deal
of
comfort
in
this
regard.
we
are
not
advocating
nor
is
the
government,
a
privity
rule
that
is
going
to
result
in
the
widespread
preclusion
of
foia
plaintiffs
who
seeks
the
same
documents
for
independent
reasons;
but
when
someone
comes
to
the
court
pressing
someone
else's
interests,
that
is
a
square
privity
issue,
and
he
should
be
barred.
