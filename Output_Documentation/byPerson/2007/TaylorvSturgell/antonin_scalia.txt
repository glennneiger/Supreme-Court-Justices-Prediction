justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
a
reason
to
file
a
foia
request
anyway,
right?
just
the
naked
curiosity
justifies
your
obtaining
the
documents,
right?
i
mean
this
is
a
lawsuit
that
does
not
require
a
reason
except
i
want
the
documents.
you've
got
them.
i'm
entitled
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
somebody
could
have
walked
in
off
the
street
and
filed
this
same
lawsuit,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
although
it
is
not
really
just
your
argument;
it
is
also
foia;
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
your
clear
rules?
give
me...
set
it
forth
clearly,
what
you
think
it
takes.
number
one,
do...
do
you
have
to
know
you're
going
to
be
bound
at
the
time
the
first
suit
is
brought?
that
isn't
the
requirement,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
are
your
tests?
how
many?
five?
four?
it
is
not
a
totality
of
the
circumstances,
test
though,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
some
criteria.
what
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
representative
that
they
agreed
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
in
a
class
action,
where
they
have
the...
the
ability
to
bow
out
if
they
want,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
mean,
and
the
individual's
ability
to
withdraw
from
the
class,
if
he
doesn't
want
to
be
bound
by
this
suit,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
crucial.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can
use
it
accurately,
bring
it
back
to
what
it
really
means...--
[laughter]
can
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
company
is
represented
by
the
same
law
firm?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you'd
also
say
that
if
the
company
paid
for
the
suit.
the
company
just...
"i
don't
want
to
be
in
control
of
it.
"
"i
don't
want
you
to
sue
in
my
name,
but
i
think
this
is
a
good
thing
for
you
to
do,
so
i'll
pay
for
it.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
the
company
says,
"absolutely
i
do
not
want
you
to
represent
me.
"
that
is
in...
in
a
letter.
okay?
so
it's
clear
that
the
law
firm
is
not
representing
the
company,
but
the
company
thinks
that
it's
a
good
idea
to
have
this
lawsuit
and
yeah,
i'll
bankroll
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you've
got
to
give
that
one
away.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he...
if
he
was
his
agent...
and
this
goes
to
justice
ginsburg's
line
of
inquiry...
suppose
in
the
second
case
herrick
tells
him
i
want
you
to
bring
a
suit
on
my
behalf.
he
says
fine,
i'll
do
that.
he
brings
that
suit.
and
then
taylor
says,
you
know,
i
also
want
to
bring
a
suit
on
my
own.
and
he
brings
another
suit,
not
as
agent
for
herrick.
i
suppose
he
could
do
that,
couldn't
he?
the
first
would
be
thrown
out
because
it's
herrick's
second
suit.
but
the...
taylor's
own
suit
would
remain
taylor's
own
suit,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
there's
no
more
collusion
or
anything
else,
he's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
hope
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a...
it's
a
standard
privity
case.
it
is
privity
in
reverse.
i
suppose
a
subsequent
owner
of
real
estate
is
in
privity
with,
and
therefore,
bound
by
a
judgment
concerning
the
real
estate
rendered
against
the
prior
owner.
but
it's
probably
also
true
that
when
there's
a
suit
by
a
later
owner,
the
prior
owner
cannot
then
bring
in
court
a
claim
based
upon
the
same...
the
same
matters
that
the
subsequent
owner
relied
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
up
privity
instead
of
down
privity.
wouldn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--counsel,
you
have
described
for
us
a
thousand-headed
monster
of
litigation,
and
your
proposal
for
a
solution
is
to
cut
off
one
eyebrow.
you're
going
to
solve
just
the
case
of,
you
know,
two
people
building
an
airplane.
you
agree,
anybody
else
in
the
association
can
file
a
lawsuit.
anybody
else
in
the
united
states
can
file
a
lawsuit,
even
if
they're
not
in
the
association.
it
seems
to
me
that,
you
know,
in
order
to
cut
off
an
eyebrow,
i'm
not
willing
to
make
a
whole
lot
of
incursion
upon
our
traditional
rules
of
who's
bound
by
a
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
we
stretch
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
sort
of
a
totality-of-the-circumstances
test
in
every
case,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
look
at
the
whole
thing,
and
we
say,
you
know,
close
enough
relationship.
it
is
not
close
enough;
close
enough.
you
need
a
better
rule
than
that
for
something
that,
you
know,
is
a
threshold
issue
in
a
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
as
bad.
you're
absolutely
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
the
opinion
said
is
to
review
the
bidding.
there
is
record
evidence
that:
one,
taylor
and
herrick
had
identical
interests;
two,
taylor's
interest
was
adequately
represented
in
herrick;
three,
herrick
and
taylor
had
a
close
working
relationship
relative
to
these
successive
cases.
and
that's
enough.
that's
enough
to
show
collusion.
