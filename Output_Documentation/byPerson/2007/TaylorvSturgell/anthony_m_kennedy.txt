justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
this
case
had
been
one
in
which
were
notice,
before
the
suit
was
filed...
or
at
the
outset
of
the
suit,
and
some
encouragement
to
go
ahead
with
the
suit,
would
that
have
fit
your,
i
guess,
second
category
of
adequate
representation,
adequate
opportunity
to
have
your...
a
case
heard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
from
a
fair--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that
is
because?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
doesn't
that
fit
at
least
the
semantic
version
of
the
category
you
gave
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
list
of
factors
is
cumulative?
they
are
not
independent
categories?
your
category
number
2
then
is
not
a
stand-alone
category
for
barring...
for
barring
the
second
plaintiff?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
that's
not
what...
that's
not
what
your
second
category
was.
i
understand
privity,
but
you
didn't...
you
weren't
just
trying
to
restate
the
concept
of
privity
in
your
second
category,
were
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
otherwise
you
would
have
just
said
privity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
