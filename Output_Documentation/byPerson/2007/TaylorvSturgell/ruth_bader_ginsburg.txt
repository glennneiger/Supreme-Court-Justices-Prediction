justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
claim
that
justice
souter
has
posited
is
not
one
that
the
second
person
would
have
been...
he
was
soliciting.
he
was
solicited
to
be
a
plaintiff
in
that
second
case.
that
is
not
the
case
that
is
involved
here.
as
far
as
we
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
far
as
we
know,
taylor
didn't
even
know
about
the
first
case.
he
brings
the
second
case.
there
is
no
indication
that
it
was
solicited
by
herrick.
so
i
don't
know
why
you're
even
reaching
the
case
where
someone...
someone
is...
you
say
has
to
be
controlled,
but
why
are
we
getting
into
the
details
of
such
a
situation
when
we
have
no
solicitation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
does
cover
idle
curiosity.
i
mean,
i
suppose
if
anyone
in
the
courtroom
were
to
file
a
request
for
the
same
information,
there
could
be
no
argument
that
there
would
be
any
kind
of
preclusion
just
because
it's
been
heard
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
judge's
obligation
to
look
out
for
the
trial
to
see,
for
example,
any
settlement
has
to
be
approved
by
the
judge
to
make
sure
it
is
fair
to
the
absent
class
members.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
word
that
we
use
is
privity.
if
you
are
in
privity
with
somebody
else,
you
can...
that's
a
pre-existing
legal
relationship.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
the
beneficiary
and
the
trustee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
the
case
here.
it
is
the
same
lawyer
that's
involved?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
case
of
the
chief's
hypothetical,
of
course,
it
would
never
come
up,
if
the
client
sends
another
lawyer
to
bring
this.
but
there's
no
automatic
preclusion
in
that
relationship
as
there
is
in
the
traditional
relationship.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
that
not
like
montana,
where
the
government
was
not
a
party
to
the
case
but
it
was
in
control
of
what
the
contractor
was
doing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
think
that
somebody
who
finances...
who
solicits
a
litigation,
recruits
someone
to
bring
the
case,
pays
for
it,
and
then
says,
"i
recruited
a
very
good
law
firm,
so
i
can
stay
out
of
it.
"
"i'm
not
going
to
try
to...
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
law,
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
manage
this
case.
"
but
someone
who
recruits
the
firm
and
pays
for
it
wouldn't
be
bound.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
explain
to
me
how
that
could
possibly
work?
i
can
understand
that
you're
making
an
argument
that
the
second
case,
there
was
a
recruitment,
there
was
collusion
or
whatever.
but
for
all
we
know
from
this
record,
how
could
taylor
possibly
be
bound
when
herrick's
suit
is
over?
because
as
far
as
we
know,
taylor
never
heard
of
that
first
case.
how
can
somebody
be
bound
by
a
litigation
in
which
they
had
no
notice,
no
opportunity
to
be
heard?
so
if
we
freeze
the
situation
at
the
end
of
case
one,
how
could
taylor
possibly
be
bound?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
he's
asking
for
herrick
who
is
bound
by
the
first
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
what
you're
saying
is
the
person
who
is
really
in
the
second
case
is
the
same
person
who
was
in
the
first
case,
and
taylor
is
simply
acting
as
an
agent
to
give
herrick
another
chance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
talking
about
binding
taylor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
finding
of
that.
there
was
no
finding
here
of
agency
relationship.
there
was
no
finding
of
collusion.
that
would
be
a
different
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
it
said
it
wasn't
reaching
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
in
the...
in
the
restatement
of
judgment,
as
far
as
i
know,
all
of
the
examples
involve
a
representational
relationship
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
first
litigation.
there's
nothing
in
the
restatement
that
suggests
that
preclusion
would
be
proper
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
here--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
agree
with
me
about
the
facts
that
we're
dealing
with
here?
as
far
as
the
first
case
is
concerned,
no
evidence
that
taylor
even
knew
that
herrick
was...
herrick
was
bringing
that
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
and
while
the
litigation
is
ongoing,
taylor
doesn't
know
about
it,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
and
is
there
any
evidence
that
herrick
asked
taylor
to
file
a
foia
request--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--after
herrick
lost
his
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question,
mr.
hallward-driemeier,
is:
did
herrick
ask
taylor
to
file
that
foia
suit?
and
i
think
your
answer
is
no.
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
evidence
that
herrick
financed
the
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
evidence
that
herrick
called
any
of
the
shots
in
that
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
case,
the
decision
that
we're
reviewing
didn't
find
any
of
those
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
another
member
of
the
club,
let's
say
another
member
of
the
aviation
association
who's
interested
in
antique
planes,
just
files
a
foia
request,
would
that
person
be
precluded
who
is...
who
knows
that
herrick
brought
a
suit
and
lost?
he's
just
a
member
of
the
club.
he
doesn't
want
to
help
herrick
restore
the
plane.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
question
was
just
a
member
of
the
association,
whether--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
why
does
there
have
to
be
any
interest?
going
back
to
a
question
i
think
justice
scalia
asked,
we're
dealing
with
a
most
unusual
statute.
you
don't
have
to
have
any
reason
for
a
foia
request.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
what
the
hypothetical
is.
i
mean
it
is
certainly
not
the
case
that...
let's
say
you
have
a
whole
busload
of
people
who
get
injured
in
the
same
accident.
plaintiff
one
sues
and
loses.
two
sues
and
loses.
three
is
not
precluded.
four
is
not
precluded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
all
that
has
been
proved,
the
problem
is
that
the
d.c.
circuit
said:
we're
not
going
to
look
into
what
they
call
strategic
whatever.
we're
going
to
take
it
just
as
it
is,
with
none
of...
no
showing
that
these
two
are
in
cahoots.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
showing
that
herrick
ever
asked
taylor...
well,
there
is
a
showing
that
they're
interested
in
rebuilding
this
plane
or
restoring
the
plane.
but
we
don't
have...
and
the
d.c.
circuit
said
it
was
not
relevant
to
its
analysis.
yes,
i
would
totally
agree
with
you
if
we
have
a
recruiting
situation,
if
we
have
a
financing
situation.
but
the
d.c.
circuit
said:
well,
that's
irrelevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
out
of
the
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
said:
we
do
not
need
to
determine
whether
they
count
as
tactical
maneuvering.
we
do
not
do
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could
be
remanded.
it
could
be
remanded
with
instructions
that
the
collusion
question
is
still
open.
prove
it.
it
hasn't
been
proved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anyone...
anyone
in
this
audience,
and
anyone
in
the
association
would
be
a
proper
foia
plaintiff;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
stetson
said
that
the
district
court
unlike
the
court
of
appeals,
did
find
collusion,
and
she
referred
to
a
page
that
i
didn't
check.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
basic
tenet
of
our
system
of
justice
is
that
anyone
who
states
a
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted
is
entitled
to
his
or
her
own
day
in
court.
therefore,
a
judgment
in
a
lawsuit
generally
does
not
bind
the
person
without
a
party
to
the
suit.
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
is
there
a
virtual
representation
exception
to
this
general
rule.
petitioner
brent
taylor
filed
suit
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
seeking
certain
documents
from
the
federal
aviation
administration.
greg
herrick(ph)
taylor's
friend
had
previously
brought
an
unsuccessful
suit
seeking
the
same
records.
the
two
men
have
no
formal
legal
relationship
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
taylor
controlled
finance,
participated
in
or
even
knew
about
herrick's
earlier
suit.
nonetheless,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
found
that
taylor's
suit
was
precluded
by
the
judgment
against
herrick.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
herrick
had
virtually
represented
taylor
in
the
prior
adjudications.
under
the
multifactor
test
announced
by
the
d.c.
circuit,
herrick
qualified
as
taylor's
virtual
representative
because
herrick's
incentive
to
litigate
was
at
least
as
strong
as
taylor's.
the
two
men
sought
release
of
the
same
documents
were
close
associates
and
hired
the
same
lawyer.
we
disapproved
the
doctrine
of
preclusion
by
a
virtual
representation.
and
therefore,
vacate
the
d.c.
circuit's
judgment.
as
our
decision
is
confirmed,
there
are
several
exceptions
to
the
rule
against
non-party
preclusion.
but
the
doctrine
of
virtual
representation
adopted
by
the
d.c.
circuit
is
broader
and
cloudier
than
any
of
the
exceptions
we
have
approved.
our
opinion
explains
why
we
find
the
doctrine
an
unwarranted
departure
from
the
general
rule
that
every
person
is
entitled
to
his
or
her
own
day
in
court.
it
was
a
result
reached
by
the
d.c.
circuit
nevertheless
justifiable
under
one
of
the
established
grounds
for
nonparty
preclusion.
most
of
those
grounds
have
no
application
here,
but
one
might
cover
this
case.
preclusion
would
be
appropriate
if
taylor,
in
pursuing
his
own
suit,
is
acting
not
independently,
but
as
herrick's
agent.
we
remand
to
give
the
courts
below
an
opportunity
to
address
that
yet
unresolved
issue.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
