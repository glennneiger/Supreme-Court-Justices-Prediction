well,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
actually
say
there
was
no
collusion,
or
did
it
say,
we
don't
need
to
reach
that
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
these
facts
do
not
necessarily
show
collusion
to
avoid
the
preclusive
effects
of
herrick?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
do
not
need
to
determine
whether
they
count
as
tactical
maneuvering.
they
did
find...
they
did
say
there
was
a
close
working
relationship
relative
to
the
successive
cases.
didn't
they
say
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
could
he
continue
to
solicit
other
members
of
the
association
to
file
foia
suits
all
over
the
country
until
they
finally
got
a
favorable
decision?
