justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
you
had
a
case
and
there's
a
suspicion
of
something
like
that
that's
here,
although
the
courts
below
did
not
so
find?
what
if
you
had
a
case
in...
like
this
in
which
the
first
litigant
said
to
the
second,
i
brought
my
case
and
i
lost.
i
want
you
to
try
again
for
me?
and
if
you
do
and
you
win,
i
will
give
you
a
job
making
use
of
the
fruits
of
the
litigation?
would
there
be
an
estoppel
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
why.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
held,
as
i
recall,
specifically,
i
think,
that
there
was
no
collusion
found.
and
the
suggestion
was
that
if
collusion
had
been
found...
and
i
was
giving
you
an
example
of
something
that
i
would
call
collusion
at
least...
that
the
result
might
have
been
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
my
example
have
done
so?
in
my
example
the
agreement
was
i
lost;
please
try
again
for
me.
and
if
you
win,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
job
making
use
of
the
fruits
of
the
lawsuit.
would
that
agreement
not
have
been
enough
to...
to
sustain
a
collusion
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
that...
why
should
that
matter?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
but
if
we
adopted...
as
i
understand
it,
if
we
adopted
your
theory
across
the
board,
it
would
preclude...
it
would
preclude
a
preclusion
in
the
case
of
my
hypothetical,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
get
at.
should
we,
by
adopting
your
theory,
eliminate
the
possibility
of
preclusion
in
the
case
that
i
put
to
you?
and
you're
saying,
i
guess:
well,
if...
even
there,
there
should
be
no
preclusion
unless
the
first
party
controlled
the
case
in
the...
controlled
the
second
case.
and
my
question
is:
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
think
that
the
collusion
point
was
perhaps
just
ill-phrased
here?
there
was
no
collusion,
certainly,
in
the
sense
that
there
was
any
kind
of
secret
dealing
going
on.
the
second
lawsuit,
the
people
involved
in
it,
couldn't
taylor...
couldn't
have
been
more
candid,
i
guess,
about
what
was
going
on.
and
so
there
was
no
collusion
in
the
sense
of
concealment
or
underhandedness.
do
you
think
that
is
perhaps
the
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
no
collusion;
and
that,
therefore,
we
ought
to
discount
that
finding?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
here
the
close
relationship
seems
to
boil
down
to
this,
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
here
because
i
may
be
missing
some
fact.
but
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
any
reason
for
taylor's
participation
or
taylor's
bringing
this
lawsuit
could
be
found
except
the
reason
of
trying
to
relitigate
herrick's
lawsuit
so
that
taylor
would
then
either
get
the
job
or
have
an
easier
time
fulfilling
the
job
of
fixing
up
the
airplane.
i
can't
think
of
any
other
reason
on
the
facts
as
i
understand
them
from
the
briefs.
is
there
a...
on
the
facts
of
case,
any
other
possible
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
why
else
would
he
be
doing...
why
else
would
he
have
been
doing
this?
what
does
the
record
show
as
another
possible
explanation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
somebody
walked
in
off
the
street
and
began
this
lawsuit
and
had
absolutely
no
connection
with
herrick,
and
so
on,
the
issue
of
preclusion
wouldn't
come
up,
or
at
least
it
wouldn't
come
up
in
the
context
that
it
comes
up
here.
but
this
isn't
somebody
who
walked
in
off
the
street,
and
the
claim
is
there
is
a
preclusion
doctrine
because
of
the
relationship
between
party
one
and
party
two.
and
the
fact
that
anybody
who
comes
in
off
the
street
could
have
asked...
could
have
made
the
same
request,
in
effect,
is
not
an
answer
to
the
collusion
claim;
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
look,
i
concede
we
can
all
see
where
you're
going,
but
isn't
the
problem
this:
in
effect,
you're
asking
us
to
infer
a
finding
of
fact,
and
we're
not
the
trial
court.
you've
raised
a
good
circumstantial
suspicion
case;
but,
either
because
it
wasn't
raised
by
your
predecessor
counsel
as
well
or
because
the...
for
some
reason
the
district
court
just
would
not
buy
it,
that's
the...
the
conclusion
that
you
want
us
to
draw
isn't
before
us.
and
i
don't
see
that
we're
the
appropriate
court
to
draw
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
at
no
point
did
the
d.c.
circuit
or
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
it,
say
that
request,
in
effect,
was
a
request
to
relitigate
this
matter
so
that
we
both,
the
owner
of
the
plane
and
the
repairer
of
the
plane,
would
have
what
i
was
seeking
in
my
first
lawsuit.
they
never
actually
crossed
the
line
and
drew
that
conclusion;
did
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
did
it--
