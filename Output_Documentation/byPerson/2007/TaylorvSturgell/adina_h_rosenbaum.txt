ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
basic
principle
of
american
law
that
a
lawsuit
does
not
decide
the
rights
of
non-parties.
that
basic
principle
has
a
few
narrow
exceptions,
none
of
which
applies
here.
taylor
had
no
involvement
in
the
prior
case.
he
had
no
legal
relationship
with
any
parties
to
that
case.
and
no
party
to
that
case
had
the
legal
authority
to
represent
him.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
i
think
that
would
depend
on
whether
the
association
in
that
case
had
the
authority
to
bring
that
case
on
behalf
of
that
individual.
in
order
for
a
person
to
be
bound
on
the
basis
of
representation
in
the
prior
case,
the
party
to
the
prior
case
had
to
have
the
authority
to
bring
the
case
on
behalf
of
that
other
person.
it
had
to
be
a
representational
relationship
where
the
party
for
the
first
case
is
exercising
the
authority
to
represent
the
later
case.
and
there
has
to
be
a
relationship
that
exists
at
the
time
of
the
first
litigation.
someone
can't
retroactively
be
represented
during
the
first
litigation.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
no,
not
just
on
those
facts.
and
i
do
want
to
emphasize--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--first
that
is
a
big
shift
from
what
was
decided
blow.
what
the
court
held
below
was
that
herrick
represented
taylor
in
the
previous
case.
it
did
not
hold
that
taylor
was
somehow
representing
herrick
in
this
case.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
collusion
is
sort
of
a
pejorative
way
of
saying
an
agreement.
an
agreement
can
be...
can
lead
to
preclusion
under
a
certain
circumstances
instances,
but
for--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--no,
not
without
the
party
to
the
first
case
controlling
the
second
case.
but
this
court
does
not--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--because
what's
being
protected
here
is
the
person's
right
to
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
their
claim.
and
in
that
case--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--second
claim.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
exactly.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
exactly.
this
court
does
not
need
to
decide
what
sort
of
solicitation
or
recruitment
or
agreement
would
reasonably--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--well,
again,
that's
a
question
of
whether
that
second
party
is
acting
as
an
agent
for
the
first
party
and
really
just
trying
to
relitigate
that
first
party's
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and
if
the
second
party
is
an
agent,
then
the
second
party
can
be
precluded.
but,
again,
exactly
what
would
constitute
that
agency
is
not
something
that
this
court
needs
to
decide,
because
the
facts
here
do
not
demonstrate
that
taylor
was
representing
herrick
in
this
case.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
no
collusion
because
the
facts
that
are
in
the
record
about
the
relationship
between
taylor
and
herrick
do
not
demonstrate
that
there
was
any
collusion.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
it
said
that
the
facts
were
ambiguous,
and
it
did
not
need
to
decide
it.
but
it
also
specifically
said
that
on
the
facts
before
it,
that
taylor
could
have
brought
an
entirely
separate,
independent
case,
separate
from
herrick.
so--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--yes.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
they
did
say
that.
but,
again,
that
just
brings
up
the
question
of
what
sort
of
relationship
is
necessary
for
the...
there
to
be
preclusion.
and
many
people
have
close
relationships
but
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
those
people
are
bound,
or
expect
to
be
bound,
by
decisions
in
each
others'
cases,
particularly--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--yes.
first,
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
agreement,
or
the
record
does
not
show
and
there
was
no
agreement
between
them
to
actually
work
on
the
plane.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
taylor
is
the
executive
director
of
the
antique
aircraft
association,
and
he
is
someone
who
is
interested
in
antique
aircraft
and
in
aviation
generally.
and
after
reading
herrick's
decision...
his
explanation
in
the
motion
for
discovery
for
filing
his
foia
request
is
that
he
read
the
decision
in
herrick,
and
that
he
understood
it
to
mean
that
he
was
legally
entitled
to
the
records.
and
so--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--yes.
it
requires
the--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--anyone
who
was
interested
in
the
record
could
file
a
foia
request
for
them.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
it
shows
that
the
problem,
if
it
exists,
of
there
being
repeated
litigation
over
the
same
records
is
not
one
that
would
be
solved
through
preclusion.
and
respondents
have
not
shown
there
actually
is
a
problem
with
repeated
litigation
over
the
same
records.
and
the
department
of
justice
represents
the
defendants
in
all
foia
cases,
so
they
would
be
able
to
know
if
that
was
a
problem
that
came
up
again
and
again.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
the
question...
that
would
then
come
down
to
whether
or
not
he
controlled
the
first
case,
because
one
of
the
categories
in
which
people
are
bound
by
prior
litigation
in
which
they
were
not
themselves
parties,
is
if
they
had
control
over
the
first
case
and
had
the
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
in
that
case.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
but
he
was
not
in
control
of
the
first
case
and
did
not
get
his
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
that
case--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--if
he
was
not
in
control
of
that
first
case,
yes,
he
could
go
ahead
as
an
individual
if
he
was
not...
if
he
is
not
representing
the
association
in
the
second
case,
but
is,
instead,
representing
himself.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
that
would
come
down
to
what
the
definition
of
"solicit"
was
and
whether
those
people
were
acting
as
agents
of
that
person
who
is
doing
the
soliciting.
but,
again,
this
court
does
not
need
to
decide
exactly
what
sort
of
solicitation
would
create
that
agency
relationship,
because
the
facts
in
the
record
here
do
not
show
that
that
is
what
happened
here.
and
also
foia
is
set
up
to
allow
there
to
be
repeated
litigation
over
the
same
records.
under
foia,
every
requester
has...
every
person
has
the
right
to
request
records.
and
once
they
have
requested
those
records
and
been
denied
them,
they
have
suffered
a
concrete
and
particular
injury;
and
they
have
the
right
to
seek
judicial
review
of
that
injury.
so
that
makes
this
case
different
from
the
taxpayer
standing
in...
cases
cited--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--that
is
the
way
congress
set
up
foia
is
to...
to
give
people
that
statutory
entitlement
to
the
records.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
exactly.
and
if
there
were
some
problem
with
people...
with
there
being
multiple
requests
for
the
same
records,
that
would
be
a
problem
for
congress
to
solve.
and
congress
has
all
sorts
of
creative
ways
of
solving
problems
when
it
thinks
that
they
are,
in
fact,
problems.
it
can
channel
all
litigation
into
one
court
or
into
one
court
of
appeals
like
it
does
for
patent
cases
to
more
easily
create
precedent,
or
it
didn't
have
to
create
foia
to
create
this
statutory,
individual
entitlement
to
begin
with.
it
could
have
sent
up
foia
more
like
a
qui
tam
case
in
which
one
person
did
represent
the
whole
public
or
the
government
in
requesting
records.
but
that's
not
what
congress
did.
congress
did
give
every
person
the
right
to
records
and
the
right
to
seek
judicial
review
when
they
were
denied
records.
and
we
can
disagree
about
whether
that
was
something
congress
should
have
done,
but
that
is
what
congress
did
and
congress's
chosen
scheme
should
not
be
altered
through
the
back
door
of
preclusion
doctrine.
the
amorphous
factors
used
by
the
lower
courts
to
hold
taylor
bound
also
have
their
problems
in
terms
of
judicial
efficiency
and
people
coming
into
court.
those
factors
do
not
give
guidance
either
to
lower
courts
or
to
litigants
themselves
about
who
can
be
bound.
i
mean,
a...
in
a
threshold
area
like
res
judicata,
it
is
particularly
important
to
have
clear
rules
about
who
can
be
bound,
to
move
on
quickly
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
without
having
to
go
through
a
lot
of
collateral
litigation;
but
the
factors
used
by
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
provide
those
clear
rules.
and
they
also
don't
provide
clear
rules
to
litigants
about
when
they
will,
in
fact,
be
bound
by...
when,
in
fact,
they
will
be
bound
by
a
case.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
no.
there
are
certain
legal
relationships
that
would
not
require
someone
to
be...
to
know
even
of
the
case
at
the
first
suit.
for
example,
a
successor
in
interest
to
property
can
buy
the
property--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--after
the
first
suit,
yet
is
nonetheless
bound
by
the--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--no,
it's--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--there
are
an--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--well,
agency
would
fall
into
a
larger
category
of,
that
there
are
certain
legal
relationships
that
treat
people
as
the
same
person
for
res
judicata
purposes
and
often
for
other
purposes;
and
those
are
substantive
relationships
created
by
underlying
substantive
law.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
people
can
also
be
bound
when
they
have...
have
had
their
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
in
the
prior
case,
through
some
involvement
in
that
case.
so
for
example,
in
montana
versus
united
states
this
court
held
that
the
government
was
bound
because
it
had
controlled
the
contractor
who
brought
the
prior
case.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
and
then
people
can
be
bound
when
they
were
represented
in
the
prior
case.
and
in
that
case,
they
did
have
their
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
the
prior
case
just
through
a
representative.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
exactly.
someone
who
had
the
authority--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--well,
a
class
action
is
a
very
good
example
of
that
representational
relationship,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
used
language
that
is
very
similar
to
the
rationales
used
for
class
actions,
talking
about
identity
of
interests
and
adequacy
of
representation,
but
it
did
not
include
any
of
the
protections
that
are
inherent
in
class
actions:
the
factors
that
need
to
be
looked
at
to
make
sure
that
class
treatment
is
appropriate.
the
specification
of
who
is
and
is
not
in
the
class.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
yes.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
that
is
crucial
in
class
actions.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
yes.
that
was
absent
here
also.
in
this
situation,
no
one
understood
that
first
case
to
be
litigating
the
rights
of
anyone
but
mr.
herrick.
mr.
herrick
did
not
understand
that
that's
what
was
happening.
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
understand
that
was
what
was
happening,
and
taylor
did
not
understand
what
was
happening.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
the
category
of
having
the
full
and
fair
opportunity--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--to
litigate
to
the--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--case...
no.
and--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--that
is
because
that
would
basically
be
setting
up
a
system
of
mandatory
voluntary
intervention.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
because
that
person
still
is
not
receiving...
is
not
fully
and
fairly
litigating
that
case.
they
are
not
involved
in
that
case,
under
that
hypothetical.
and
they're
not
in
control
of
that
case.
merely
knowing
about
a
case,
knowing
that
one
could
voluntarily
intervene
is
not
enough.
and
this
court
has
stated--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--it
can
be
in
certain
circumstances.
just
because
a--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--yes.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
but--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--the
category
talking
about--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--full
and
fair
litigation?
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
the
problem
with
the
term
"privity"
is
that
privity
is
often
used
as
somewhat
at
the
conclusion--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--to
mean
that
someone
is
bound
by
the
prior
case.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
what
is
generally
meant
by
the
privity,
or
often...
the
way
the
word
is
often
used
to
mean
that
a
substantive
legal
relationship,
but
lower
courts
have
sometimes
put
the
control
cases
in
the
category
of
privity.
they
have
sometimes
put
the
adequate
representation
cases
in
the
category
of
privity.
so
just
talking
about
privity,
it...
doesn't
really
give
the
bounds
of
who
would
be
bound
by--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--who
would...
if
the
company
filed
its
own
foia
case,
we
request
on
behalf--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--and
the
law
firm
brought
it
on
behalf
of
the
law
firm--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--but
the
company
is
bringing
it
on
behalf
of
the
company?
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
then
they
are
separate
requestors
who
each
have...
who
have
their
own
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
their
own
foia
claim.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
yes.
even
if
they're
represented
by
the
same
law
firm.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
yes.
but--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--well,
people
are
not
generally
precluded
because
of
their
lawyers'
actions
in
prior
cases.
and
this
court--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--the
question
there
would
come
down
to
whether
the
company
was
representing
the...
whether
the
law
firm
in
that
instance
was
representing
the
company
with
the
authority
to
be
representing
the
company.
in
that--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--i
think
it
would
go
to
the
underlying
agreement
between
the
law
firm
and
the
company
and
whether
the
company
had
somehow
given
the
law
firm
authority
to
be
filing
this
foia
request
and
then
filing
the
lawsuit.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
right.
again,
if
the
company
was
in
control,
and
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
that
sort
of
agreement
that
it
was
represented--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--i
think
that
could
be
an
indicator
that
the
company
was...
that
the
law
firm
was
representing
the
company.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
if
the
law
firm
does
not
have
the
authority
to
represent
the
company,
then
it's
hard
to
see
how
the
company
could
be
bound
by
a
decision--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--i
think
that
that's
a
harder
instance.
and
that
really
goes
back
to
why
it
means
to--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--control
a
case.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
no.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
again
it
comes
back
to
whether
those
people
have
given
the
person
bringing
the
case
the
authority
to
represent
them
in
that
lawsuit.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
yes,
and
i
still
think
in
that
situation
there
also
would
not
be
preclusion.
but
the
questions
of
when
someone
controls
a
prior
case
are
very
different
from
what
happened
here
where
there
was
no
notice
of
that
prior
litigation,
but--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--if
they
had
not
given
the
law
firm
the
authority
to
represent
them
in
that
particular
case,
then
they
are
not
bound.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
well,
then
that
is
sort
of
standard
representation
by
a
law
firm
of
a
company,
and
those
people
would
be
legally
represented
in
that
lawsuit,
have
had
their
day
in
court
and
would
be
bound
by
that
decision.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
thank
you.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
thank
you.
first,
i
want
to
address
the
two
cases
brought
up
by
the
government.
in
des
moines
valley
railroad
that
was
someone
who
had
the
right
to
the
land
because
of
a
grant
from
the
government.
in
that
case,
specifically,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
government...
that
congress
had
passed
a
law
that
had
the
government
give
up
all
interest,
that
showed
that
the
government
had
given
up
all
interests
in
the
land.
and
in
the
rock
island
railroad
case,
that
had
to
do
with
a
beneficiary
and
the
administrator
of
an
estate.
these
are
legal
relationships
that
give
rise
to
privity,
and
that's
exactly
the
point.
there
are
relationships
that
do
give
rise
to
privity,
but
the
relationship
between
taylor
and
herrick
is
not
one
of
them.
the
government
also
pointed
out
that
foia
requestors
can
bring
suit
in
different
venues,
and
that
is
the
case.
they
can
bring
it
in
the
district
of
columbia,
where
the
records
are,
or
where
they
are.
but
as
they
pointed
out,
that
is
the
way
that
foia
is
set
up.
congress
allowed
requestors
to
bring
suits
in
different
places,
and
that's
not
the
way
congress
needed
to
establish
foia.
it
could
have
made
one
place
the
sole
venue
for
bringing
suit
under
foia
but
it
did
not.
and--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--so
they
bring--
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
--i
think
what
would
have
to
be
looked
at
there
is
control
or
representation.
but
again,
the
facts
here
do
not
show
that
there
is
any
agreement
between
taylor
and
herrick
to...
there's
no
agreement
either
to
repair
the
plane;
but
more
specifically,
there
are
no
agreements
to
bring
this
lawsuit.
so
this
court
does
not
need
to
reach
the
question
of
exactly
what
sort
of
agreement
would
lead
to
preclusion,
and
the
problem
with
the
lower
court's
decision
here
is
that
they
did
just
look
at
a
grab
bag
of
amorphous
factors
to
hold
taylor
bound.
they
talk
about
a
close
relationship
without
it
being
the
sort
of
relationship
under
which
one
party
is
representing
the
other
or
under
which
they
have
a
legal
relationship.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
the
district
court
did
think
that
there
was
tactical
maneuvering
happening
here.
but
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
concluding
that
there
had
been
an
agreement
between
them.
ms.
adina
h.
rosenbaum
yes.
the
court
could
remand
it
and
then
the
district
court
would
have
the
discretion
to
allow
the
case
to
go
forward
as
it
saw
fit.
and
the
problem...
the
problem
with
the
factors
looked
at
by
the
lower
courts,
with...
basing
privity
on
just
amorphous
facts
and
basically
just
having
courts
check
their
gut
about
whether
or
not
that
relationship
is
sufficient,
is
that
it
ends
up
with
people
being
found
in
privity
when
they
did
not
actually
have
their
right
to
be
heard,
the
way
taylor
did
not
here.
instead,
privity
should
be
based
on
underlaying
rationales
that
protect
the
litigant's
right
to
be
heard
and
ensure
that
they
do
have
their
day
in
court.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions.
