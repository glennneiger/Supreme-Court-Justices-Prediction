mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
the
precise
formulation
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
may
be
somewhat
novel,
its
holding
of
a
finding
of
privity
here
is
consistent
with
well-established
principles
of
res
judicata.
where
multiple
persons
engage
in
coordinated
successive
litigation
to
vindicate
a
joint
interest
with
respect
to
which
a
judgment
in
favor
of
any
of
them
will
benefit
all,
then
a
judgment
in
the
first
litigation
in
which
that
interest
is
adequately
represented
binds
the
others
as
well.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
think
it's
important
to
start
by
recognizing
that
even
petitioner
acknowledges
that
there
can
be
circumstances
in
which
taylor
would
be
bound,
even
though
at
the
time,
at
the
end
of
herrick's
litigation,
he
had
no
notice,
he
had
not
participated.
and
that
is,
on
their
view
and
ours
as
well,
that
if
herrick
had
thereafter
created
an
agency
relationship
with
taylor,
and
taylor
then
as
agent
went
and
brought
the
second
foia
suit--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
right.
and...
but
all
of
that
can
exist
or
be
created
after
the
first
litigation
is
over.
and
so
the
absence
of
notice
in
the
first
case--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's...
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well...
but
taylor
in
the
second
suit
that
he
brings
as
agent
to
advance
the
interests
of
herrick
would
be
bound.
taylor
would
be
barred.
his
suit
would
be--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
i
don't...
the
court
certainly
did
not
find
that
there
was
no
collusion.
i
agree
that
the
court
didn't
reach--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--it
didn't
reach
the
question
of
what
they
called
"tactical
maneuvering".
i
think
that
there
is
a...
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
that
taylor
was
herrick's
agent;
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
critical
to
find
that
he
was
his
agent
in
the
very
technical
sense
of
the
restatement
of
agency.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no.
no,
taylor--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--if
taylor
brought
the
second
suit
in
his
own
name
and
it
was
found
to
be
barred
by
res
judicata,
a
third
suit
in
taylor's
own
name
would
likewise
be
barred.
and
there's
a
case
that
i
think
illustrates
this
point
perhaps
better
than
any
of
those
we
cited
on
our
brief,
unfortunately.
but
i
think
it's
helpful--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--because...--
[laughter]
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
proves
the
point
that
has
been
the
sort
of
underlying
concern
of
many
of
the
questions:
what
happens
when
you're
just
shy
of
a
true
agency
relationship?
and
the
case
is
united
states
versus
des
moines
valley
railroad.
it's
an
eighth
circuit
case,
84
f.
40
from
1897.
but
importantly,
this
court
quoted
it
at
length
in
the
chicago,
rock
island
and
pacific
railroad
versus
schendel
case--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--yes.
yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
the
schendel
case
is
270
u.s.
611.
and
they
discuss
des
moines
valley
at
page
619.
and
what
had
happened
in
des
moines
valley
was
that
the
united
states
had
granted
some
land
to
the
state
of
iowa,
which
in
turn
passed
to
the
railroad,
which
in
turn
sold
to
one
claimant.
there
was
another
person
who
claimed
directly
from
the
united
states
as
a
homesteader.
there
had
been
litigation
between
the
person
claiming
via
the
railroad
and
the
homesteader
as
to
who
had
title
to
the
land.
and
the
judgment
in
state
court
was
adverse
to
the
homesteader.
and
what
happened
later,
about
10
years
later,
was
that
the
united
states
brought
suit
to
have
declared
invalid
the
title
of
the
person
claiming
via
the
railroad.
and
the
district
court
actually
initially
questioned
whether
the
united
states
had
standing
to
bring
the
case
at
all.
they
viewed
it
as
fairchild's
case.
that
was
the
homeowner...
the
homesteader,
a
little
coincidence
with
this
case,
which
also
has
a
fairchild.
but
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
it
wasn't
deciding
whether
the
united
states
had
standing
to
bring
the
case
in
its
own
name...
the
case
was
litigated
by
the
united
states
attorney...
they
looked
to
the
purpose
that
the
united
states
sought
to
vindicate.
they
said
that
the
united
states
does
not
seek
to
obtain
title
to
this
property
for
itself
again.
they
are,
in
a
sense,
lending
their
name
to
allow
fairchild
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
now,
there
was
no
control
that
fairchild
had
over
the
united
states.
fairchild
didn't
direct
the
united
states
attorney
who
was
representing
the
united
states.
but
the
united
states
had
taken
up
the
interest
of
fairchild,
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
it
had
standing
to
sue
itself--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
think
what
your
honor
is
reacting
to
is
the
reality
of
the
situation
seems
to
be
that
there's
a
sufficient
relationship
between
these
two
that
they
ought
to
be
barred.
but
there
is
no
section
of
the
restatement
(second)
that
specifically
governs
this
case.
and
petitioner's
view,
which
is
that
somehow
the
restatement
(second)
has
become
codification
of
res
judicata
law
would
not
permit
it.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
that
the
restatement
(second)
does
not,
for
example,
state
the
law
which
we
all
know
and
which
petitioner
concedes
is
the
case,
and
that
is
that
the
agent
who
brings
the
second
lawsuit
is
bound,
even
if
the
agency
relationship
arose--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--after
the
first
relation
was
concluded.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
what
the
evidence
shows
is
that
herrick
made
taylor
aware
of
the...
of
the
outcome
of
the
litigation,
but
we
don't
have--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--there's
no
evidence
of
that.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
the--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
evidence
is
that
herrick
asked
taylor
to
help
him
fix
the
plane,
the
plane
and
its
restoration
being
the
object
of
herrick's
own
foia
case.
taylor,
in
order
to
get
those
documents,
which
were
essential--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--to
the
restoration
of
the
plane--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--there
is
no
evidence
that
herrick
asked
taylor
specifically
to
file
the--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the...
there
is
no
specific
evidence
of
that.
the
counsel
on
the
other
side--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
counsel
on
the
other
side
filed
an
affidavit
that
said...
it
was
very
carefully
crafted,
i
think...
that
there
was
no
attorney-client
relationship
with
herrick
with
respect
to
this--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no,
that's
right.
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
was
the
fact
that
taylor
had
made
herrick's
interest
his
own
and
brought
the
suit
in
order
to
vindicate
the
exact
same
interests
that
herrick,
himself,
had
already
litigated
and
lost.
and
that
was
to
get
the
documents
to
restore
herrick's
plane.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no,
that
person
is
not
barred.
and--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
think
in...
your
honor's
first
question
to
opposing
counsel
was
such
that,
yes,
i
think
that
if
that
was
the
individual
whose
interest
was
relied
upon
to
give
an
association
standing,
that
it
would
bind
the
individual
whose
name
and
interest
was
relied
on.
and
this
is
in
some
ways
the
reverse
situation
where--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no,
the
court
of
appeals
was
clear
that
just
a
common
membership
in
an
association
or
just
a
common
interest
would
not
be
enough.
they...
they
distinguished
the
situation
of
a
common
interest
in
a...
in
the
same
objective--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that...
that's
true.
we
think
that
that,
in
fact,
makes
foia
even
more
susceptible
to
this
kind
of
vexatious
litigation
that
petitioner
seems
to
think
is
entirely
permissible.
and
the
courts
have
held
that
the--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
because
foia
allows--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--a
number
of
defendants--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
foia
allows
the
case
to
be
brought
in
a
number
of
different
venues.
it
can
be
brought
in
the
venue
of
the...
where
the
requestor
lives,
where
the
documents
are
located,
or
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
and
so
a
person
such
as
herrick
could
ask
for
assistance
on
his
project,
the
project
of
rebuilding
the
plane,
of
people
scattered
throughout
the
country.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
and
they
could
maintain
it
throughout
the
country.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
in
foia,
especially
an
exemption
4
case,
there
are
special
burdens
on
the
government.
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
exemption
is
warranted.
so
the
plaintiff
can
just
sort
of
lob
anything
in
there.
the
government...
there
is
the
burden
of
persuading
the
court
in
each
case
that
the
exemption
is
warranted.
fairchild,
a
private
party
that
wants
to
protect
its
own
property
interests
in
the
trade
secret,
is
forced
to
go
around
the
country
litigating
this
over
and
over
and
over
again
as
well.
and
the
courts
that
have
considered
the
question
recognize
that
the
public-right
nature
of
the
interest
is
one
that
makes
application
of
the
rule
particularly
appropriate
because
both
the
interests
of
the
individual
litigant,
the
plaintiff,
is
reduced,
but
also
the
opportunity
for
vexatious
relitigation
is
increased
multiple
times
because
of
the
almost
infinite
number
of
potential
plaintiffs.
this
case
was
decided
by
the
lower
court
on
the
basis
of
the
relationship
between
herrick
and
taylor.
it
was
the
fact
that
taylor
had
taken
up
herrick's
own
interest.
there
was
the
interest
in
the
project.
the
project
was
the
restoration
of
the
plane.
herrick
owned
the
plane.
herrick
had
brought
suit
based
on
that
interest
and
lost.
he
asked
taylor
to
help
him
in
that
project.
taylor
then
brings
the
suit
to
get
the
same
documents
for
the
same
purpose.
and
we
think
that
the
u.s.
versus
des
moines
valley
railroad
case
is
an
example
where,
just
shy
perhaps
of
an
actual
agency
relationship,
because
there's
no
control
in
des
moines
valley,
that
still
the
fact
that
the
second
litigant
has
volunteered
to
take
their
name
to,
in
a
sense,
take
advantage
of
the
fact
they
have
independent
standing--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--we
are
not
advocating
a
broad
rule.
we,
in
fact--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--think
that's
one
of
the
virtues
of
our
argument:
that
where
there
is
a
document
that
is
of
true
public
interest
such
that
multiple
individuals
on
entirely
independent
grounds
might
well
seek
it,
they
would
not
be
barred.
but
where
a
document
has
commercial
value
like
this
one
does
to
mr.
herrick,
so
that
he
can
restore
his
plane
without
going
to
the
incredible
expense
of
developing
another
manner
to
prove
to
the
faa
the
airworthiness
of
that
plane,
there
is
that
commercial
value
that
gives
him
the
incentive
to
try
to
relitigate
over
and
over
again.
and
on
petitioner's
view,
as
long
as
he
stops
just
shy
of
an
agency
relationship,
he
can
do
that
throughout
the
country.
and
this
is--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
the
rule
is
a
broader
rule.
and
we've
pointed
out
that
it
has
in
common
with
the
rule
with
respect
to
co-beneficiaries
that
existed
since
the
1800s
at
the
very
latest,
the
rule
as
stated
in
section
48
of
the
restatement,
which
is
an
example,
a
counter-example,
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
question
about
whether
it
always
had
to
be
a
pre-existing
legal
relationship,
because
section
48
deals
with
a
particular
situation
where
there
are
multiple
individuals
who
can
claim
for
personal
injury
of
one
of
them.
and
the
section
is
stated
in
terms
of
another
person,
not
a
family
member.
and
the
commentary
to
this
section
makes
clear
that
although
most
situations
where
it
would
apply
would
be
family
members,
it
also
applies
to...
and
i
want
to
quote
it:
"a
de
facto
connection
may
sometimes
suffice
as
well
as
a
formally
valid
one.
"
so
the
law
of--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--but
it
recognizes
there
could
be
a
close-enough
relationship
between
the
two
such
that
the
purposes
of
the
rule
would
be
satisfied,
but
there
is
no
legal,
familial
relationship.
and--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--they
didn't
need
to
because
of
the
fact
that
taylor
had
voluntarily
taken
up
herrick's
interests
to
get
a
second
bite
at
the
litigatory
apple,
as
the
first
circuit
put
it.
and
it
is
not
the
fact,
as
petitioner
would
argue,
that
every
time
another
person
has
an
individual,
standing
right
to
sue
under
a
statute,
that
it
means
that
that
person
necessarily
gets
to
relitigate
where
a
person
with
whom
they
have
a
close
relationship
such
as
this
has
already
litigated
and
lost.
and
so,
getting
back
to
your
honor's
question--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
interesting
that
the
restatement
with
respect
to
the
third
category
in
the
reply
brief...
they
called
it
the
third
category
of
control
perhaps.
it
is
described
in
the
restatement
in
comment
to
section
62
as
where
the
person
falls
short
of
becoming
a
party
but
which
justly
should
result
in
his
being
denied
an
opportunity
to
relitigate.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that
is
the
nature...
that
is
the
nature
of
res
judicata
principles.
that
it
is
not:
can
you
avoid
this
by
avoiding
the
legal
technicalities?
it
is
the
substance
of
the
relationship
that
counts.
thank
you,
your
honor.
