chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-371,
taylor
versus
sturgell.
ms.
rosenbaum.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
have
a
situation
where
it
is
an
associational
standing
case,
and
an
individual
is
the
one
that's
relied
upon
give
the
association
standing,
in
that
case
is
the
individual,
even
though
he's
not
bringing
the
suit,
is
he
barred
by
the
association's
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
if
it
is
the
executive
director
of
the
association,
and
the
suit
is
brought
in
the
name
the
association,
and
they
lose.
can
he
bring
suit
as,
you
know,
i'm
just
joe
blow,
but
i
happen
to
be
the
executive
director,
but
i'm
bringing
this
in
my
own
name?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
say
that
it
is
somebody
above
him,
you
know,
the
president
of
the
association,
who
decides
what
lawsuits
are
brought,
and
he's
just
the
executive
director?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
recommended
to
the
president,
said
we
ought
to
file
this
lawsuit.
the
president
said
okay,
and
they
did,
and
then
they
lost.
can
he
go
ahead
as
an
individual?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
means
your
statement
implicates
very
serious
questions
of
standing
under
article
iii,
whether
congress
can
say
create
the
injury
by
saying
you've
been
denied
records
and,
therefore,
you
have
standing.
i
think
that's...
i
wouldn't
go
ahead
assuming
that
that
was
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
have
a
situation
where
a
client
has
retained
a
law
firm
to
do
something
and
the
law
firm
as
part
of
its
normal
activity
files
a
foia
request?
they
think
something
useful
is
going
to
come
up
there,
and
it's
denied,
and
the
law
firm
on
its
own,
and
not
as
the...
not
as
retained
by
the
company
files
a
foia
suit?
in
that
case,
is
the
company
bound
by
the
determination
in
the
case?
or
can
they
then
file
another
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
the
law
firm...
the
law
firm
files
its
own
foia
request,
and
it
is
denied,
and
they
litigate
that,
and
then
they
lose,
and
the
company
brings
a
foia
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but...
i
guess
to
be
fair
to
my
hypothetical,
it
was
the
company
that
was
paying
for
what
the
law
firm
was
doing.
it
just
wasn't
the...
the
filing
of
the
suit.
the
law
firm
went
off
on
it
own.
maybe
it
does
it
all
the
time
when
they
have
a
case,
they
think
this
might
be
helpful
and
they
are
filing
a
foia
request.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
purely
a
formal
inquiry?
in
other
words,
let's
say
the
company
is
paying
the
law
firm
to
represent,
but
the
law
firm
just
filed
in
its
own
name?
does
that
make
a
difference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
a
company--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--let's
say
some
group,
say,
public
citizen
litigation
group
sends
a
fundraising
thing
around
saying
we
think
all
our
members
ought
to
contribute
to
a
special
fund
so
that
we
can
bring
a
lawsuit
under
foia.
are
all
of
those
individual
contributors
then
bound
by
the
result?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
make
as
difference
if
it's
one
company
as
opposed
to
40
donors?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
in
the
previous
hypothetical
there
was
no
authority
to
represent.
they
just
said,
"i
think
this
is
a
good
idea,
here's
the
money.
"
"here.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
controls.
so
there
are
three
companies,
and
they
each
have...
you
know,
they
can
vote.
they
each
have
33-percent
control.
are
they
each
bound,
or
because
they
didn't
control
it
none
of
them
are
bound?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
said,
yes,
you
can
represent
us,
and
we're
three
different
companies,
and,
you
know,
it's
a
majority
vote
as
to
what
you
can
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
you
make
your
friend
on
the
other
side
aware
that
you'd
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
if
he's
the
individual
in
the
club
that
gave
the
club
standing,
associational
standing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
an
approach
that
only
applies
in
foia
cases?
i
would
assume
in
every
other
case
you
have
the
normal
article
iii
requirements
of
injury,
which
limits
exactly
who
can
sue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
stetson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
associational
cases:
the
association
brings
a
suit
in
the
interests
of
the
members?
are
those
members
bound?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
association
standing
cases
we
talk
about
germane,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
stetson.
ms.
rosenbaum,
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
two
people
get
together
who
want
the
same
documents
for
the
same
purpose,
which
is
they
think
they're
going
to
make
money
off
of
it.
and
they
say
which
ever
gets
it
we'll
share
with
the
other
and
we'll
split
the
money
we're
going
to
get?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
separate...
separate
suits,
separate
requests,
separate
suits.
they
just
want
to
double
their
chances
of
getting
the
documents,
but
they
agree
to
split.
they
think
they're
going
to
make
a
hundred
dollars
off
of
this
and
agree
to
split
it
50-50,
regardless
of
who
wins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
we
need
to
remand
this
for
consideration
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
agreement,
if
we
conclude
that
what
we
see
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
isn't
enough?
as
i
understand,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
an
agreement
was
necessary.
so
regardless
of
what
the
district
court
said,
al
thought
that
was
an
issue
that
was
litigated,
it
was
not
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
rosenbaum.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-371,
taylor
versus
sturgell.
