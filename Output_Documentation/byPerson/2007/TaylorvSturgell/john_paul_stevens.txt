justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
a
general
question
here.
why
isn't
the
defense
of
stare
decisis
adequate
to
take
care
of
all
your
problems?
justice
john
paul
stevens
repeated
requests--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
they're
all
the
same,
wouldn't
they
say,
well,
that's
the
same
case
we
had
last
week?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct,
and
he's
the
one
who
raised
the
suit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
any...
defeat
the
suit
by
claiming
there
was
preclusion
because
of
a
suit
in
another
jurisdiction,
rather
than
stare
decisis?
