but
would
you...
would
the
monitoring
suffice?
in
other
words,
you
started
out
by
saying
there
is
no
way
that
it
could
be
administered
and
assure
100
percent
against
risk,
so
it
would
be
helpful
if
you
clarified:
yes,
there
is
a
way
of
monitoring
adequately
and
tell
us
what
that
would
be,
or
no,
there
is
no
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
verrilli,
i
think
that
your
main
argument
in
this
case,
i
mean,
there's...
barbituate
only
seems
to
have
come
up
rather
late
in
the
day,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
but
your
main
arguments
seem
to
be
that
the
controls
were
inadequate.
so
you
were
beginning
to
say
what
controls
would
be
necessary
to
render
this
procedure
constitutional,
and
one
that
you
said...
trained
personnel
to
monitor
the
flow.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--two
questions:
who
would
the
trained
personnel
be?
and,
the
second
question,
what
would
be
the
measures
that
they
would
employ?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
use
those
emts?
would
they
be
qualified?
would
the
team
that
inserts
the
iv,
would
that
team
be
qualified?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
government
has
told
us
they
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
federal
response.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
englert,
i
thought
that
there
wasn't
a
serious
question
about
who
inserts
the
iv,
that
those
are
trained
people,
but
the
point
that
was
highlighted
was
that
the
people
who
control
the
flow
into
the
iv
connection,
that
those
people
have
no
training,
the
ones
that
are
called
executioners,
the
ones
who
operate
the,
what
is
it,
the
syringe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
also
are
not
trained
people.
i
think
what
seems
puzzling
to
me
is
the
state
has
made
an
effort
to
make
sure
that
the
people
on
the
team
that
inserts
the
iv,
that
those
are
well-trained
professional
people,
but
then
apparently
they
leave
the
room,
so
that
once
the
iv
is
inserted
there
is
no
professional
person
that
has
any
further
part.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
still
unclear
why
they
should
make
such
an
effort
to
get
trained
personnel
in
the
first
instance
and
then
even
if
they
are
in
the
next
room,
why
isn't,
why
did
they
deliberately
pick
nonprofessional
people
to
both
administer
the
drugs
and
to
check
the
inmate
for
consciousness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
reasons.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
have
you
that
expert
team
and
it
seems
that
they
would
be
preferable
to
executioners
who
have
no
professional
qualifications.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean
the
people
who
administer
the...
who
place
the
iv
lines.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
executioners
are
also
not
visible
to
the
public?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
finding
that
the
second
drug
serves
no
therapeutic
purpose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre
would
you
explain
to
me
why
the
federal
government
has
picked
five
grams
instead
of
three.
