chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
the
case
07-5439,
baze
v.
rees.
mr.
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
verrilli,
your
argument
is
based
on
improper
administration
of
the
protocol.
you
agree
that
if
the
protocol
is
properly
followed
there
is
no
risk
of
pain?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
expert...
i'm
looking
at
page
493
to
494
of
the
joint
appendix...
agreed
that
if
the
two
grams
of
sodium
pentothal
is
properly
administered,
the
way
he
put
it,
in
virtually
every
case
there
would
be
a
humane
death.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
method
has
never
been
tried,
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
know
whether
there
are
risks
of
pain
accompanying
that
method?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
record
establishes
that
the
second
drug
that's
used
here
is
used
to
prevent
involuntary
muscle
contractions.
that
would
not
be...
there
wouldn't
be
a
safeguard
against
that
under
one
drug
protocol,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you...
do
you
agree
that
that
is
an
appropriate
problem
to
be
addressed
by
the
execution
protocol,
that
they
should
try
to
reduce
the
likelihood
of
involuntary
muscle
contractions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that
their...
one
of
their
reasons
was
that
it
would
enhance
the
dignity,
not
only
of
the
procedure
as
a
whole,
but
also
to
the
condemned.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
we
do
with
the...
if
you
prevail
here,
and
the
next
case
is
brought
by
someone
subject
to
the
single
drug
protocol
and
their
claim
is:
look
this
has
never
been
tried.
we
do
know
that
there's
a
chance
that
it
would
cause
muscle
contractions
that
would
make
my
death
undignified.
it
will
certainly
extend
how
long
it
takes
to
die,
so
i'm
subject
to
a
lingering
death
and
the
more
humane
protocol
would
be
the
three
drug
protocol?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
objections
that
would
apply
even
to
your
single
drug
protocol.
you
tell
us
that
one
reason
this
challenged
protocol
doesn't
work
is
because
people
will
mix
the
drugs
in
the
wrong
way,
including
the
sodium
pentathol.
that
objection
would
still
be
there
if
we
adopted
your
alternative,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
focusing
specifically
on
the
mixing
of
the
drugs.
the
mixing
of
the
sodium
pentathol
would
be
undertaken
under
the
kentucky
procedure
and
under
your
proposed
alternative,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
verrilli.
mr.
englert?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
kentucky
law
do
anything
other
than
adopt
the
avma
guidelines.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
presumably
it
would
depend
upon
whatever
new
alternative
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
proposed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
mr.
garre?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
garre.
mr.
verrilli,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
anesthesia
concern
of
course
is
you
don't
want
to
kill
the
person
when
you're
administering
just
anesthesia
in
a
surgery
so
you
would
want
somebody
trained
there
to
ensure
that
you
could
bring
them
back
if
anything
went
wrong
that
concern
is
not
present
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
announcement
in
case
numbers
07-5439,
baze
et
al.
versus
rees,
commissioner
of
the
kentucky
department
of
corrections.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
kentucky's
method
of
carrying
out
a
capital
sentence
by
means
of
lethal
injection
violates
the
eighth
amendment's
ban
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishments.
36
states
and
the
federal
government
use
lethal
injection
for
capital
punishment
and
most
of
them
use
the
same
protocol
as
that
used
by
kentucky.
this
consists
of
the
sequential
intravenous
administration
of
three
drugs.
the
first,
sodium
thiopental,
induces
unconsciousness.
the
second,
pancuronium
bromide,
suppresses
physical
movement
and
the
third,
potassium
chloride,
stops
the
heart.
the
parties
agree
that
successful
delivery
of
the
first
drug
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
prisoner
from
experiencing
severe
pain
that
would
otherwise
result
from
the
administration
of
the
second
and
third
drugs.
petitioners
concede
that
an
execution
under
kentucky's
procedures
would
be
humane
and
constitutional
if
performed
properly.
they
claim
however
that
there
is
a
significant
risk
that
the
procedures
will
not
be
properly
followed
so
that
the
first
drug,
sodium
thiopental
will
not
be
correctly
administered.
they
contend
that
subjecting
those
condemned
to
death
to
that
risk
violates
the
eighth
amendment
given
alternative
procedures
that
they
assert.
kentucky
could
employ
to
obviate
the
risk.
the
kentucky
trial
court
held
extensive
hearings,
and
entered
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
upholding
kentucky's
procedures
as
constitutional.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
affirmed
holding
that
the
state's
procedures
do
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment
because
they
do
not
create
substantial
risk
of
wanton
and
unnecessary
infliction
of
pain.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirmed.
seven
justices
agree
with
this
disposition
although
for
somewhat
different
reasons.
in
a
plurality
opinion
expressing
my
views
that
is
joined
by
justices
kennedy
and
alito,
we
explained
that
to
prevail
under
eighth
amendment
claim,
petitioners
must
show
a
substantial
risk
of
serious
harm.
petitioner's
primary
contention
is
that
the
risks
they
have
identified
can
be
eliminated
by
adopting
certain
alternative
procedures.
ones
that
they
believe
will
improve
the
likelihood
of
proper
delivery
of
the
thiopental.
because
our
cases
require
a
proof
of
a
substantial
risk,
a
prisoner
may
not
succeed
on
his
eighth
amendment
claim
merely
by
showing
a
slightly
or
marginally
safer
alternative.
otherwise,
courts
would
become
embroiled
in
endless
litigations
seeking
to
determine
best
practices
for
capital
punishment,
an
issue
that
would
often
turn
on
scientific
controversies
beyond
judicial
expertise.
such
an
approach
would
with
no
justification
intrude
on
the
role
of
the
states
in
implementing
execution
procedures,
a
role
that
by
all
accounts,
the
states
have
fulfilled
by
providing
for
progressively
more
humane
manner
of
implementing
capital
punishment.
therefore,
a
state's
refusal
to
adopt
an
alternative
execution
procedure
may
violate
the
eighth
amendment
only
where
the
alternative
procedure
is
feasible,
readily
implemented,
and
in
fact,
significantly
reduces
a
substantial
risk
of
severe
pain.
petitioners
have
not
made
such
a
showing.
kentucky
has
put
numerous
safeguards
in
place
to
ensure
that
the
prisoner
will
be
safely
sedated.
the
state
employs
qualified
trained
professionals
to
establish
the
iv
catheters
through
which
the
drugs
are
administered
and
those
same
professionals
established
both
primary
and
secondary
iv
sites
so
that
if
an
insufficient
dose
of
the
first
drug
is
initially
administered,
an
additional
dose
can
be
given
through
the
secondary
site.
problems
administering
a
proper
amount
of
sodium
thiopental
are
readily
observable
and
the
warden
and
deputy
warden
remain
with
the
prisoners
to
watch
for
problems
that
may
arise
during
the
execution.
likewise,
the
alternatives
offered
by
petitioners
fall
far
short
of
establishing
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
they
advocate
a
one-drug
protocol
that
relies
solely
on
large
dose
of
sodium
thiopental.
but
no
state
has
adopted
such
a
protocol
and
petitioners
have
not
carried
their
burden
of
showing
that
it
would
be
an
equally
effective
manner
of
imposing
a
death
sentence.
petitioners
also
fault
kentucky
for
lacking
a
systematic
mechanism
for
monitoring
the
prisoner's
level
of
sedation.
but
the
testimony
in
this
case
showed
that
a
proper
dose
of
thiopental
obviates
the
concern
that
a
prisoner
will
not
be
sufficiently
sedated.
the
procedures
are
in
place
to
help
ensure
delivery
of
a
proper
dose
and
that
the
proposed
additional
monitoring
mechanisms
have
their
own
problems.
reasonable
people
of
good
faith
disagree
on
the
morality
and
efficacy
of
capital
punishment.
and
for
many
who
oppose
it,
no
method
of
execution
would
ever
be
acceptable.
this
court
however
has
ruled
that
capital
punishment
is
constitutional
and
so
there
must
be
a
means
to
implement
it.
petitioners
have
not
shown
that
the
means
chosen
by
kentucky
means
it
shares
with
most
states
administering
capital
punishment
and
the
federal
government
constitute
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
this
court
has
never
invalidated
a
particular
method
of
execution,
yet
our
society
has
steadily
moved
to
more
humane
methods
of
carrying
out
capital
punishment
culminating
in
today's
consensus
on
lethal
injection.
court
decisions
have
not
been
necessary
to
achieve
this
progress
and
this
court's
approval
of
a
particular
method
in
the
past
has
not
precluded
legislatures
from
taking
steps
to
continue
that
progress.
there
is
no
reason
i
suppose,
that
today's
decision
will
be
any
different.
the
decision
below
is
affirmed.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
stevens
