what
are
they?
that
is,
i
was...
i
can't
find...
what
should
i
read?
because
i've
read
the
studies.
i've
read
that
lancet
study,
which
seemed
to
me
the
only
referee
for
it
said
it
wasn't
any
good.
and
i've
read
the
zimmer
study
and
i
found
in
there
an
amazing
sentence
to
me
which
says
that
the
netherlands
information
task
force
concluded
it
is
not
possible
to
administer
so
much
of
it
that
a
lethal
effect
is
guaranteed.
they're
talking
about
thiopental.
so
i'm
left
at
sea.
i
understand
your
contention.
you
claim
that
this
is
somehow
more
painful
than
some
other
method.
but
which?
and
what's
the
evidence
for
that?
what
do
i
read
to
find
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
what
they're...
they're
giving
a
three
gram
dose,
i
take
it,
and
if...
or
two
grams
or
three
grams;
i
thought
it
was
three
grams
here.
and
i
ended
up
thinking
of
course
there
is
a
risk
of
human
error.
there
is
a
risk
of
human
error
generally
where
you're
talking
about
the
death
penalty,
and
this
may
be
one
extra
problem,
one
serious
additional
problem.
but
the
question
here
is
can
we
say
that
there
is
a
more
serious
problem
here
than
with
other
execution
methods?
i've
read
the
studies.
what
else
should
i
read?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
we
do
with
the
euthanasia...
instead
of
talking...
i
looked;
i
found
it
more
important
to
look
at
what
they
do
with
euthanasia
than
to
look
at
what
they
do
with
animals,
frankly,
and
i
was
therefore
taken
aback
with
the
sentence
i
just
read
to
you.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
do
we
do
about
the
point...
the
point
that
the
doctors
or
the
nurses
say
it's
unethical
to
help
with
an
execution?
i
mean,
if
we
are
going
to
talk
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty
per
se,
that
isn't
raised
in
this
case.
and
what
the
other
side
says
is,
well,
you're
just
trying
to
do
this
by
the
back
door,
insist
upon
a
procedure
that
can't
be
used.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to,
i
mean,
i
can't,
i
don't
know
if
"substantial"
is
the
right
word
to
capture
it.
perhaps
the
right
word
is
is
there
a
significant
risk
that
can
be
easily
averted
and
what
i'm
worried
about
here
is
do
we
or
do
we
not
send
it
back,
i'm
quite
honestly
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
in
this
netherlands
euthanasia
report
they
both
recommend
pancuronium
and
say
that
the
thiopental
alone
doesn't
work
not
even
in
grams
of
three
doses
in
all
cases
but
they
think
the
contrary
and
if
there
is
uncertainty
here
should
we
send
it
back
for
consideration
of
all
these
things
in
a
more
full
hearing
under
a
standard
that
does
allow
comparisons
with
other
methods
not
to
find
a
comparison
not
too
fine
a
comparison
but
at
least
a
practical
comparison.
