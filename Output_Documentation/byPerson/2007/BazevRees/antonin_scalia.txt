who
would
be
a
medical
doctor...
and
medical
doctors,
according
to
the
code
of
ethics
of
the
american
medical
association,
can't
participate.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
verrilli,
this
is
an
execution,
not
surgery.
the
other
side
contends
that
you
need
to
monitor
the
depth
of
the
unconsciousness.
when
you
expect
to
bring
the
person
back
and
do
not
want
harm
to
occur
to
the
person.
but
they
assert
that
to
know
whether
the
person
is
unconscious
or
not
all
it
takes
is
a
slap
in
the
face
and
shaking
the
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
their
contention.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
regard
to
the
trial
court's
failure
to
make
findings
about
the
availability
of
people
to
do
this
and
about
the
possibility
of...
practical
possibility
of
more
effective
and
less
painful
drugs,
was
that
a
failure
to
ignore
evidence
that
you
produced?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
introduce
evidence
to
show
that
indeed
medically
trained
personnel
were
readily
available
to
do
the
things
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
very
reluctant
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court
so
we
can
have
a
nationwide
cessation
of
all
executions
while
the
trial
court
finishes
its
work
and
then
it
goes
to
another
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
ultimately,
well,
it
could
take
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
want
that
to
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
been
discussing
this
as
though
that
is
a
constitutional
requirement.
where
does
that
come
from,
that
you
must
find
the
method
of
execution
that
causes
the
least
pain?
we
have
approved
electrocution,
we
have
approved
death
by
firing
squad.
i
expect
both
of
those
have
more
possibilities
of
painful
death
than
the
protocol
here.
where
does
this
come
from
that
in
the,
in
the
execution
of
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
killing
people
we
must
choose
the
least
painful
method
possible?
is
that
somewhere
in
our
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
the
concern
was
with
torture,
which
is
the
intentional
infliction
of
pain.
now,
these
states,
the
three-quarters
of
the
states
that
have
the
death
penalty,
all
except
one
of
whom
use
this
method
of
execution,
they
haven't
set
out
to
inflict
pain.
to
the
contrary,
they
have
introduced
it
presumably
because
they,
indeed,
think
it's
a
more
humane
way,
although
not
one
that
is
free
of
all
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unnecessary
and
wanton,
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
you're
changing
your
position.
you
said...
you
just
said
earlier
that
we
didn't
have
to
find
the
least
painful
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you're
not
using
the
least
painful
way,
you
are
inflicting
unnecessary
pain,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
rectify
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
hanging
certainly
would,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
hard
question?
is
that
a
hard
question,
whether
hanging
would,
whether
you
had
experts
who
understood
the
dropweight,
you
know,
that
was
enough
that
it
would
break
the
neck?
justice
antonin
scalia
hanging's
no
good.
what
about
electrocution?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be,
it
has
to
be
painless?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
you'd
have
to
show
it's
unusual,
not
painless.
i
mean,
cruel
and
unusual
is
what
we're
talking
about.
there's
no
painless
requirement
in
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
this
unnecessary
pain
requirement
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
dictum
in
our
cases,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
dictum
in
our
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
part
of
the
analysis,
this
never
ends.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
part
of
the
analysis,
there
will
always
be
some
claim
that
there
is
some
new
method
that's
been
devised,
and
once
again
executions
are
stayed
throughout
the
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
who
oppose
capital
punishment
entirely
across
the
board
are
quite
willing
to
take
a
careful
look
at
everything.
they
are
quite
willing
to
take
a
look
at
other
alternatives.
that's
the
problem
we
come
up
with
a
decision
that
requires
a
careful
look
in
every
case
whenever
there
is
a
newly
developed
method
of
execution
the
problem
will
always
be
before
us
and
executions
will
always
be
impermissible.
we
agree
with
those
concerns,
justice
scalia,
i
want
to
be
clear.
our
standard
is
not
a
least
risk--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
that
substantial,
that
comparison
with
other
possibilities
is
not
necessary
so
long
as
the
only
risk
that
is
coming
is
a
risk
of
negligence
or
improper
execution
of
what,
of
what
the
protocol
requires
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
that
so
long,
so
long
as
the
only
risk
comes
from
negligent
application
of
the
protocol,
no
comparison
is
required?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
we
decided
that,
if
we
decided
that
if
this
protocol
is
properly
executed,
it
does
not
create
a
substantial
risk
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter
wouldn't
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
would
not
have
another
case
in
front
of
us
next
year.
