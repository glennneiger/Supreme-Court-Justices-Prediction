mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
verrilli
and
i
agree
that
if
the
first
drug
is
properly
administered
there
will
be
a
painless
death.
it
is
only
if
the
first
drug
is
not
properly
administered
that
there
is
any
possible
constitutional
argument
in
this,
in
this
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
because
the
administration
of
the
first
drug
is
so
important,
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
safeguards
kentucky
has
in
place
to
make
sure
that
the
first
drug
is
properly
administered.
contrary
to
what
mr.
verrilli
has
suggested,
kentucky
has
excellent
safeguards
in
place.
let
me
start
with
who,
who
puts
in
the
iv
line,
which
is
the
most
critical
step
of
the
process.
kentucky
uses
what
is
probably
literally
the
best
qualified
human
being
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
to
place
the
iv
line.
it
uses
a
phlebotomist
who
in
her
daily
job
works
with
the
prison
population.
the
problems
the
prison
population--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
training
is
a
certain
amount
of
learning
followed
by
on-the-job
experience.
this
person
places
30
needles
a
day
in
the
prison
population
and
at
page
273
of
the
joint
appendix
it
points
out
that
she
works
in
her
daily
job
with
the
prison
population.
so
what
she
is
used
to
from
many
years
of
working
with
the
prison
population
is
the
kind
of
problems
of
compromised
veins
we
have
in
the
inmate
population
specifically.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it's
someone
like
the
person
who
inserts
an
iv
in
a
hospital.
the
experts
in
this
case
all
agreed
that
in
a
hospital
setting
ivs
are
not
inserted
by
medical
doctors,
they
are
inserted
by
phlebotomists.
that's
what
they
do.
they
teach
medical
residents
how
to
insert
ivs
because
doctors
in
training
don't
know
how
to
do
this.
and
it's
what's
somewhat
derisively
referred
to
as
scut
work
in
the
hospital
setting.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
kentucky
has
safeguards
in
place
to
make
sure
that
the
inmate
is
asleep
before
the
second
and
third
drugs
are
given.
now,
with
respect
to
those
people's
training,
it's
not
accurate
that
they
have
no
training.
kentucky
has
had
one
execution
since
1998,
since
it
adopted
lethal
injection,
one
execution
altogether
by
lethal
injection.
it's
had
100
practice
sessions.
kentucky
requires
monthly
practice
sessions
every
month
by
the
execution
team
because
it
is
very
concerned
to
get
it
right.
now,
with
respect
to
pushing
the
iv,
those
are
people
whose
training
is
participation
in
the
practice
sessions,
but
to
make
sure
that
the
first
drug
has
had
its
intended
effect,
the
warden
and
the
deputy
warden
are
in
the
execution
chamber.
they
are
literally
right
on
top
of
the
inmate.
it's
suggested
in
the
briefs
that
they're
feet
away.
that's
not
accurate.
the
record
reflects
they
are
inches
away.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's...
to
say
they
leave
the
room
is
accurate,
but
the
suggestion
that
they
have
no
further
part
is
misleading.
they
go
into
the
next
room.
they
watch
through
a
one-way
mirror,
carefully
watching
to
make
sure
nothing
has
gone
wrong.
they're
in
close
proximity
to
the
inmate
and
they
are
watching
now
with
respect
to
the
warden
and
deputy
warden
it's
been
suggested
they
don't
know
what
to
look
for.
that's
false.
the
record
shows
otherwise.
the
main
problem
in
the
executions
that
have
gone
wrong
the
main
problem
is
an
iv
goes
into
tissue
instead
of
the
vein.
if
that
happens,
dr.
dershowitz
testified,
pages
600
to
601
of
the
joint
appendix
the
inmate
would
be
awake
and
screaming.
the
warden
and
the
deputy
warden
know
how
to
tell
the
difference
between
someone
whose
eye
haves
closed
and
who
seems
to
have
gone
to
sleep
and
someone
who
is
awake
and
screaming.
it's
not
just
dr.
dershowitz,
it's
dr.
haas
and
dr.
highland,
pages
353
and
386
of
the
joint
appendix
also
testified
that
this
would
be
clear.
now,
mr.
verrilli
says
use
a
blood
pressure
monitor
as
a
safeguard.
justice
kennedy
said
doesn't
the
record
show
that
that's
not
of
any
use
at
very
low
blood
pressures,
and
justice
kennedy
is
exactly
correct,
at
page
578
of
the
joint
appendix.
dr.
dershowitz
testified
that
the
blood
pressure
cuff
simply
would
have
no
usefulness
in
monitoring
at
this
level
of
introduction
of
the
barbituate.
mr.
verrilli
has
mentioned
the
one
drug
protocol
at
some
length
this
morning
and
has
said
it
is
certain
to
cause
death
if
three
grams
of
sodium
thiopental
are
administered.
his
expert,
dr.
heath,
page
499
of
the
joint
appendix,
was
asked
let's
assume
that
you
don't
take
any
other
measures
and
gave
a
three-gram
dose
of
sodium
thiopental,
what
would
you
expect
to
happen?
i
would
expect
the
blood
pressure
to
drop.
would
that
kill
them?
no,
i
wouldn't
expect
it
to
cause
death.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--justice
stevens,
let
me
be
very
precise
in
this
answer,
if
i
can.
what
is
clear
is
that
a
rapidly
administered
three
or
five
gram
dose
of
a
barbituate
would
cause
death
in
normal
circumstances.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
problematic
actually.
this
is
all
way
outside
the
record.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
the
human
body
can't
take
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
the
barbituates,
so
it
actually
becomes
problematic
to
go
past
five
grams,
which
is
why
nobody
comes
goes
higher
than
five
grams.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
not
effective.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
it's
more
than
unpleasant
appearance
of
death,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
the
drug
that
creates
the
risk
of
excruciating
if
and
only
if
the
first
drug
is
improperly
administered.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
and
the
justification
is
many
safeguards
are
in
place
to
make
sure
the
first
drug
is
properly
administered
so
it
doesn't
create
any
real
risk.
and
second,
it
does
bring
about
a
more
dignified
death,
dignified
for
the
inmate,
dignified
for
the
witnesses.
it's
not
just--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
a
substantial
risk
of
excruciating
pain,
a
substantial
risk
of
excruciating
pain--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
if
i
may
answer
your
question
a
little
bit
indirectly.
that
risk
cannot
be...
the
risk
of
pain
can
be
avoided
by
single
drug
protocol,
but
there's
not
a
certain
death
with
one
drug
protocol.
it's
also
a
very...
it
takes
a
very
long
time
to
die
with
one
drug
protocol.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
again,
your
honor,
this
is
way
outside
the
record.
what
dr.
dershowitz--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
no.
they
use
a
single
drug
with
animals
because
that
is
the
tradition
the
american
veterinary
medical
association
has
come
up
with,
using
somewhat
different
considerations.
that's
what
they've
come
up
with--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
use
of
pancuronium
bromide
or
any
neuromuscular
blocking
agent,
any
paralytic,
is
barred
by
kentucky
law--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--in
the
veterinary
setting
someone,
some
appropriate
policymaker
has
made
the
decision
that
what
they
perceive
as
risks
outweigh
the
benefits.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--all
the
kentucky
law
does
is
forbid
the
use
of
a
neuro
muscular
blocking
agent
euthanizing
animals
and
that's
there
is
no
record
of
this
but
presumably
that's
because
veterinarians
told
the
state
legislature
that
was
a
good
idea.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
much
is
reasonable.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
what's
deleterious
about
using
the
second
drug
we
all
agree
is
if
the
first
drug
is
maladministered
it
can
cause
pain.
if
the
first
drug
is
not
maladministered
no
pain,
no
pain
in
humans,
no
pain
in
animals,
the
judgment
was
made
weighing
the
costs
and
benefits
in
the
veterinary
context
not
to
use
the
second
drug,
the
judgment
has
been
made
by
everyone
who
has
looked
at
this
in
the
death
penalty
context
to
use
the
second
drug.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
the
length
of
time
it
takes
to
die.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
you
go
outside
the
record
of
this
case
in
which
the
record
wasn't
allowed
go
into
the
harbison
record
the
logic
i
believe
dr.
dershowitz
testified
he
would
expect
it
to
take
30
minutes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
depends
on
how
large
the
risk
of
excruciating
pain
is
here
there
is
very
little
evidence
risk
of
excruciating
pain.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
that
is
one
of
my
points
but
that's
not
my
whole
point
justice
souter.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
take
a
look
at
speaking
rhetorically,
one
can
take
a
look
at
the
list
of
so-called
botched
executions
in
this
country,
the
appendix
to
professor
xxxx
law
review
article,
the
death
penalty
information
center
website.
the
so-called
botched
executions
aren't
executions
in
which
there
was
pain.
they
are
executions
in
which
in
the
overwhelming
majority
one
of
three
things
happened.
it
took
a
long
time
to
find
a
vein
and
that's
the
only
reason
they
say
it
was
botched
or
the
inmate
showed
muscle
movements
the
exact
same
thing
the
pancuronium
bromide
prevents
and
with
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
there
was
any
pain
accompanying
those
muscle
movements
the
advocates
on
the
other
side
suggest
those
are
botched
executions
or
somebody
made
a
human
error
and
didn't
get
the
vein
properly.
those
are
the
cases
like
the
clark
execution
in
ohio
where
the
man
said
"it's
not
working".
you
don't
need
medical
training
to
tell
when
the
guy
says
it's
not
working
that
it
hasn't
gone
into
the
vein.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
beyond
the
absolute
bare
minimum
likelihood
that
is
inherent
in
any
process
that
involves
human
beings.
they
argue
the
mixing
of
the
drugs
is
a
problem.
there
is
a
finding
of
fact
to
the
contrary
by
the
district
court
well
supported
by
evidence.
they
argue
that
the
placing
of
the
ivs
is
a
problem
kentucky
really
doesn't
have
the
best
qualified
person
in
the
state
to
place
the
ivs,
they
argue
that
there
is
a
risk
because
the
people
watching
don't
know
what
to
look
for.
all
they
need
to
look
for
is
swelling,
whether
the
person
is
awake,
that's
noticeable
to
a
lay
observer.
they
argue
that
the
personnel
monitoring
the
execution
are
not
sufficiently
close
which
is
false.
the
warden
is
inches
away.
that's
the
testimony--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--there
are
reasons
for
that
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
okay.
to
administer
the
drugs
the
only
trained
personnel,
the
only
so-called
trained
personnel
are
the
people
who
are
barred
by
the
ama
ethics
requirements
and
by
kentucky
law
from
administering
the
drugs.
doctors
and
nurses.
as
to--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
expert
team
the
people
who
have
had
100
practice
sessions
since
the
last
execution
are
the
people
who
administer
the
drugs.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
i
think
what's
properly
before
the
court
is
only
the
latter
question.
but
obviously--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i...
the
court
could
write
an
opinion
either
way,
obviously.
there
is
a
good
reason
to
hold
that
the
use
of
the
second
drug
is
permissible.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--petitioner's
own
brief
acknowledges
that
the
three-drug
protocol
can
be
applied
constitutionally.
judge
fogel
in
the
morales
case...
california--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--every
state
that
has
publicly
said
what
it
uses,
uses
the
three-drug
protocol.
it
would
be
very
strange
to
hold
that
that
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
no.
14
legislatures
have
required
it.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
three-drug
protocol.
justice
ginsburg,
back
to
your
question.
there
is
a
reason
why
the
iv
team
members
leave
the
room.
the
curtains
are
opened
after
the
ivs
are
placed,
and
the
people
in
the
room
can
be
seen
by
the
victim's
families,
by
the
inmate's
families
and
by
the
media.
protecting
the
anonymity
of
members
of
the
execution
team
is
extremely
important.
they
are
subject
to
all
kinds
of
pressures
if
their
anonymity
is
not
protected.
so
instead
of
staying
in
the
room,
they
go
again
behind
a
one-way
mirror
in
an
adjacent
room
where
they
have
an
extremely
good
line
of
sight
to
the
ivs.
this
is
actually
covered
in
the
trial
record
in
this
case,
that
they
do
have
a
good
line
of
sight.
and
it's
not...
nothing
really
changes
because
they
go
into
another
room.
pages
210
and
286
to
287
of
the
joint
appendix
is
where
there
is
testimony
that
the
people
in
the
adjacent
room
do
have
a
good
view
of
the
iv
line.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
the
purpose
it
serves
is
the
purpose
of
dignifying
the
process
for
the
benefit
of
the
inmate
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
witnesses.
the
chief
justice
said,
isn't
there
going
to
be
litigation
against
another
protocol
as
soon
as
it's
adopted,
and
yes,
mr.
verrilli
will
say
that's
silly,
to
protect
the
dignity
of
the
inmate,
that
argument
will
fail.
but
the
history
of
death
penalty
litigation
suggests
that
the
next
advocate
who
comes
along
representing
an
inmate
will
say,
the
one
drug
protocol
is
no
good
because
it
doesn't
do
enough
to
protect
the
dignity,
or
the
two
drug
protocol
is
no
good
because
it
doesn't
do
enough
to
protect
dignity.
with
respect
to
the
time
it
takes
to
carry
out
an
execution
and
whether
that's
a
legitimate
consideration,
i
actually
invite
the
court's
attention
to
one
of
the
briefs,
amicus
briefs,
filed
in
support
of
petitioners,
the
human
rights
watch
brief,
which
in
turn
cites
the
decision
of
the
un
human
rights
committee
in
the
ng
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
question.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'll
tell
you
frankly
how
you
could
hold
that.
what
will
happen
in
the
next
case
is
they
will
say:
this
issue
wasn't
raised
in
the
trial
court
in
kentucky,
therefore
the
supreme
court
decided
this
case
on
an
inadequate
factual
record,
and
therefore
the
court
should
take
a
new
look
at
it
because
life
and
death
are
at
stake.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
correct.
if
the
standard
is
truly
eliminating
all
unnecessary
risk
of

what
they
have

the
last
220

which
is
to
use
different

at
different

and
