justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
verrilli,
are
we
in
the
difficult
position
in
hearing
your
answers
that,
in
effect,
we're
being
asked
to
make
findings
of
fact
about
the
availability
of
medical
personnel
and
the
feasibility
of
training
and
so
on
that
the
trial
court
never
made
because
it
didn't
think
it
had
to
make
a
comparative
analysis
here,
so
that
if,
in
fact,
the
comparative
analysis
is
crucial
to
the
case,
we
should
send
the
thing
back
for
factfinding
by
a
trial
judge
rather
than
trying
to
do
it
here.
should
we
remand
if
we
accept
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
state
of
the
evidence.
it
really
goes
to
an
understanding
of
your
position
that
was
discussed
a
little
bit
earlier
about
the
preferability
of
simply
barbiturate
dose
as
opposed
to
the
three-drug
combination.
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
evidence
was...
and
i
think
it
was
undisputed
evidence...
that
three
grams
of
the
barbiturate
actually
used
would
be
sufficient
to
cause
death;
is
that
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
was
undisputed?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if
the
current
three-gram
dosage
were
used
and
the
second
and
third
drugs
were
not
administered,
death
would
occur
based
on
the
undisputed
evidence
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
secondly,
my
understanding,
my
recollection,
is
that
in
a
couple
of
places
in
your
brief,
one
at
least,
you
referred
to
the
preferability
of
administering
a,
and
i
think
the
term
was,
massive
dose
of
barbiturate,
which
i
took
to
mean
more
than
the
three
grams.
is
that
what
you
meant?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
the
massive
dose.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
about
what
the
enhanced
dose
would
appropriately
be
if
you
decided
or
if
a
protocol
author
decided
that
there
would
be
no
chance
whatsoever
that
death
would
not
occur,
and
the
amount
should
be
greater
than
three
grams?
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
about
how
much
there
ought
to
be
if
you
were
going
to
go
above
three
grams?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
this
is
obvious,
but
i
wondered
when
i
went
through
the
brief.
i
assume
this
phlebotomist
is
not
an
md?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
training?
i
mean,
"phlebotomist"
is
somebody
who
works
with
veins,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
somebody
like
the
red
cross
worker
who
puts
in
the
needle
when
somebody
donates
blood.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it
required
by
kentucky
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
something
more
is
involved
than
merely
veterinary
practice.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
but
in
the
setting
of
kentucky
law
the
legislature
of
kentucky
has
said
we
are
going
to
make
this
a
legal
requirement
and
i
assume
they
had
some
reason
for
it
other
than
the
fact
that
vets
do
it
that
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
was
that
necessary
to
pass
a
law
if
the
standard
veterinary
practice
was
not
to
use
t
i'm
obviously
trying
to
get
to
what
evidence
we
have
here
for
a
finding
somewhere
that
we
can
take
into
consideration
that
there
is
a
comparative
benefit
under
the,
under
the
veterinary
practice
as
distinct
from
the
protocol
which
has
been
devised
so
isn't
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
kentucky
legislature
needs
some
kind
of
a
finding
came
to
some
kind
of
a
conclusion
that
in
fact
there
was/seug
deleterious
about
using
the
second
drug.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
cost
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
but
the
only
cost
that
you
have
identified
in
using
the
one
drug
only
are
number
one,
the
appearance
cost
which
you
equated
with
dignity
in
your
response
to
justice
stevens
and
number
two,
the
possibility
and
i
don't
know
how
strong
a
possibility
but
the
possibility
that
the
one
drug
would
not
work.
is
there
any
other
cost?
in
using
one
drug.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
you
don't
have
a
figure
for
that,
justice
stevens
said
10
minutes
and
i
don't
think
you
had
a
clear
answer
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
there
was
likely
to
be
more.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
30
minutes
is
against
some
risk
of
excruciating
pain
is,
that
in
effect
is
it
reasonable
to
say
30
minutes
is
too
long.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
your
point
that
there
is
simply
no
quantification
of
what
that
risk
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay
what's
your.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
nub
of
your
argument
really
is
they
have
not
made
a
case
or
they
do
not
have
a
record
case
for
any
significant
likelihood
of
excruciating
pain.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
to
the
response
which
i
think
was
in
the
briefs
that
the
substantiality
requirement
has
been
derived
in
the
course
of
conditions
of
confinement...
sort
of
litigation...
and
we
really
should
regard
execution
as
sort
of
a...
a
separate
subject
for
purposes
of
coming
up
with
a
standard.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
did
for
purposes
of
making
a
habeas
1983
distinction,
but
i...
is
the
distinction
supportable
when
we
come
down
to
the
question
whether
there
should
be
a
standard
specific
to
execution
as
opposed
to
other
conditions?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes
but
if
we
don't
do
something
like
that
in
this
case
mr.
garre
another
case
is
going
to
come
along
and
we
are
going
to
be
right
back
here
a
year
from
now
or
18
months
from
now
and
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
get
one
case
litigated
thoroughly
and
get
the
issue
decided
rather
than
simply
wait
here
for
another
one
to
wind
its
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure
but
if
we
decide
it
on
this
basis
the
next
petitioner
is
going
to
say
i'm
coming
into
court
with
evidence
these
people
did
not
present
and
therefore
we
are
going
to
have
a
new
case
and
new
round
of
litigation
and
i
think
what's
disturbing
justice
breyer
what's
disturbing
me
and
others
is
we
want
some
kind
of
a
definitive
decision
here,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
expeditious
way
of
getting
it
if
comparison
analysis
is
appropriate
and
i
will
be
candid
to
say
i
think
it
is
is
to
send
this
case
back
and
say
okay
do
a
comparative
analysis,
make
the
findings
and
we
will
then
have
a
case
that
will
in
effect
resolve
the
issue
as
much
as
one
case
can
ever
do.
