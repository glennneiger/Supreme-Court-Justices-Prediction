mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
ask
this
court
to
invalidate
a
method
of
execution
that
everyone
agrees
is
entirely
pain
free
when
followed
and
to
order
the
state
of
kentucky
to
adopt
a
method
that
has
never
been
used
in
any
execution
and
is
out
of
step
with
the
laws
and
practice
in
every
death
penalty
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states.
the
proposed
constitutional
standard
that
petitioners
say
requires
this
extraordinary
result
has
several
fundamental
flaws.
first,
it
is
at
odds
with
this
court's
precedence
establishing
a
substantial
risk
threshold
for
claims
of
future
injury
in
the
eighth
amendment
context
and
this
court's
cases
holding
that
the
added
anguish
caused
by
the
negligent,
accidental
or
inadvertent
infliction
of
pain
is
not
the
unnecessary
infliction
of
pain
prescribed
by
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
marshall
wrote
that
for
the
court
in
the
estelle
v.
gamble
opinion
on
page
105,
and
this
court
has
reiterated
the
principle
that
negligent,
accidental
or
inadvertent
infliction
of
pain,
however
strong
or
anguishing,
is
not
proscribed
by
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
a
few
things.
we
are
here
today
in
this
section
1983
action,
because
this
court
and
the
hill
case
and
the
nelson
case
analogized
methods
of
execution
claims
to
conditions
of
confinement
claims
insofar
as
these
claims
are
not
directed
to
the
punishment
itself,
but
to
the
manner
in
which
punishment
is
implemented
or
carried
out.
so
this
court
itself
under
the
hill
and
nelson
case
put
these
types
of
cases
into
the
conditions
of
confinement.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
think
it
is,
justice
souter.
the
substantial
risk
standard
that
the
court
has
applied
in
the
farmer
v.
brennan
case
and
the
hiland
v.
mckinney
case...
applied
to
conditions
of
confinement
claims...
where
inmates
faced
the
risk
of
an
excruciating
pain
or
even
death.
if
the
risk...
if
the
standard
that
the
court
applies
to
someone
who
is
forced
to
spend...
to
live
with
a
five
pack
a
day
smoker
is
substantial
risk,
even
though
that
person
faces
the
risk
of
developing
lung
cancer,
which
everybody
would
agree
is
excruciatingingly
painful
death
they're
not
sure
why
the
constitution
would
place
any
different
standard
with
respect
to
the
types
of
claims
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think
that
that
could
be
part
of
the
analysis...
that
you
would
look
to
other
feasible
available
alternatives.
although
i
would
say
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
justice--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
we
agree
with
that,
and
that's
why
we
think
that
petitioner's
standard
is
wrong.
it's
going
to
lead
to
endless
litigation
and
a
regime
in
which
there
is
no
finality.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make,
in
response
to
justice
alito,
is
that
as
a
threshold
matter,
this
court
case
is
establishing
that
you
have
to
show
with
respect
to
the
method
you're
challenging,
a
risk
that
is
more
than
the
risk
of
negligence
or
accident
in
the
method
that
is
being
carried
out.
and
again,
estelle
v.
gamble
establishes
that,
farmer
v.
brennan
reiterates
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
the
way
that
we've
described
it,
justice
kennedy,
is
you
that
have
to
show
a
substantial
risk
that
the
method
you're
challenging
would
impose
a
considerably
greater
degree
of
pain
than
other
available
feasible
alternatives.
but
to
get
into
that
kind
of
comparative
inquiry,
we
do
think
that
you
have
to
get
over
the
first
threshold
established
by
this
court's
cases...
that
you're
arguing
about
something
other
than
the
accidental
or
negligent
infliction
of
pain,
and
we
don't
think
petitioners
in
this
case
have
even
gotten
over
that
hurdle.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
threshold
two
would
as
well
because
once
you're
into
that
kind
of
comparative
inquiry
you
would
still
have
to
take
a
careful
look
at
the
feasible
other
alternative
and
no
one
has
ever
tried
the
one
drug
alternative.
justice
breyer
you're
right
we
don't
know
whether
it's
going
to
work
in
practice.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
the
answer
is
no.
first
and
foremost
they
had
an
opportunity
to
develop
the
one
drug
alternative
below.
they
made
no
effort
to
present
any
evidence
on
that.
the
record
is
completely
undeveloped
and
typically
this
court
doesn't
allow
people
to
go
back
and
relitigate
a
case
again.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think
that
this
court
should
decide
the
issue.
we
think
it
should
decide
it
by
saying
petitioners
have
not
established
a
constitutionally
significant.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
let
me
make
two
responses
to
that
if
i
could
again
we
don't
think
petitioners
have
shown
anything
close
to
a
substantially
of
risk
that
would
get
you
into
that
comparative
analysis
here
and
second
a
virtue
in
allowing
there
is
a
virtue
in
not
going
further
in
this
case
and
allowing
the
states
themselves
to
continue
to
assess
this
matter.
the
states
have
continuously
reassessed
and
repeated
modifications
to
their
lethal
injection
protocols
three
states
within
the
last
years
have
taken
major
internal
reviews
of
the
three
drug
protocol
california
tennessee
and
florida
they
have
all
concluded
that
additional
safeguards
were
warranted
but
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
would
be--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
probably
true.
there
is
no
shortage
of
imagination
on
the
death
penalty
advocates
that
have
brought
those
kinds
of
claims
but
a
decision
along
those
lines
would
go
a
great
way
to
providing
greater
clarity
and
certainly
in
this
area.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
may
i
answer
the
question.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes
your
honor.
the
federal
government
concluded
that
that
was
an
appropriate
dosage
to
ensure
a
deep
consciousness
among
the
condemned
inmate.
other
jurisdictions
have
picked
three
grams
and
i
would
say
that
the
federal
government
is
currently
considering
whether
five
or
three
is
the
correct
dosage.
but
the
federal
government--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--unconsciousness,
yes
to
render
the
inmate
deeply
unconscious
for
a
number
of
hours
that's
established
by
the
record
thank
you
very
much.
