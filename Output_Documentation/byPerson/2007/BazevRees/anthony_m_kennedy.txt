justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it
were
properly
administered,
would
you
have
a
case
here?
let's
assume
100
percent
of
cases
are
properly
administered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
my
question--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let's
assume
hypothetically,
and
we
know
this
isn't
true,
that
100
percent
of
the
time
it's
properly
administered.
then
do
you
have
an
argument
to
present
to
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
were
interrupted,
and
you
gave
justice
ginsburg...
you
said
you
have
two
problems
for
monitoring.
she
asked
you
who
would
do
this
and
what
measures
would
they
use.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
were
never
able
to
get
to
the
second.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
to
the
cuff,
i
thought
the
record
was
rather
clear
that
it
is
just
not
used
at
these
low
blood
pressure
levels.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
standard
is
that
there
has...
well,
don't
let
me
misphrase
it
for
you,
but
there
have
to
be
other
obvious
available
alternatives.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
threshold
one
is
the
only
safeguard
you
have
against
justice
scalia's
concern
against
endless
litigation,
or
does
your
threshold
two
do
the
same
thing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
mean
to
say
unconsciousness.
