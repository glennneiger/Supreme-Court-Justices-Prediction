well,
that
seems
to
be
a
big
part
your
argument,
but
it
doesn't
appear
that
that
argument
was
raised
at
all
in
the
kentucky
courts,
and
it
seems
that
there
is
virtually
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
shows
that
that's
practical
or
that
it's
preferable
to
the
three-drug
protocol.
it
may
well
be,
but
without
anything
in
the
record
of
this
case,
how
could
we
hold
that
the
three
drug
protocol
is
unconstitutional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
was
it
raised?
the
citations
in
the
brief
that
was
submitted
by
your
co-counsel
are
inaccurate
to
show
that
it
was
raised
in
the
kentucky
courts.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
that's...
that's
the
trial
court,
and
you
think
that
just
the
word
an
"alternative
chemical
poses
less
risk"
is
sufficient
to
raise
the
argument
that
the
three-drug
protocol
is
unconstitutional,
because
a
single
drug
protocol
involving
thiopental
is
preferable.
that
one
word?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
your
position
that
every
form
of
execution
that
has
ever
been
used
in
the
united
states,
if
it
were
to
be
used
today,
would
violate
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
which
form
that's
been
used
at
some
time
in
an
execution
would
not
violate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
no
doubt
that
the
three
judge
protocol
that
kentucky
is
using
violates
the
eighth
amendment,
but
you
really
cannot
express
a
judgment
about
any
of
the
other
methods
that
has
ever
been
used?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
any
comparative
element
in
the
substantial
risk
standard,
if
it
were
clearly
established,
undisputed
that
there
was
an
alternative
method
that
was
much
less
risky,
would
there
be
an
eighth
amendment
problem
with
the
state
or
the
federal
government
nevertheless
persisted
in
using
a
method
that
was
inferior?
