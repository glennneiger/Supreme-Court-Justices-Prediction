but
do
you
also
agree
with
the
counter-proposition
that
if
it
is
not
properly
administered
there
is
some
risk
of
excruciating
pain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
agree
that
if
that
risk,
say,
occurred
in
every
case,
that
it
would
violate
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
clear
that
a
five
gram
administration
of
that
drug
would
be
fatal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
it's
in
this
document
that
we
received
the
last
few
days,
this
long
deposition
of
dr.
dershowitz.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
doesn't,
if
you
just
administered
more
of
the
drug,
then
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
contend
that
the
second
drug
in
the
three-drug
protocol
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
execution
effective?
justice
john
paul
stevens
particularly
the
one
that
the
chief
justice
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
want
to
have
unpleasant
appearance
of
death
at
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
justification
for
the
second
drug
when
it
does,
that
is
the
drug
that
creates
the
risk
of
excruciating
pain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
dignity
of
the
process
outweighs
the
risk
of
excruciating
pain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
the
risk
of
excruciating
pain
outweigh
the
risk
of
an
undignified
death?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
a
minimal
risk.
everyone
who
goes
through
the
process
knows
there
is
some
risk
of
excruciating
pain
that
could
be
avoided
by
a
single-drug
protocol.
would
he
prefer
to
say,
i
want
to
die
in
a
dignified
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
"very
long?
"
"10
minutes?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
use
a
single
drug
protocol
for
animals
because
it's
more
humane
than
the
three
drug
protocol.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
englert,
can
i
ask
you
a
rather
basic
question?
do
you
think
the
constitutionality
of
the
three-drug
protocol
itself
is
at
issue
in
this
case
or
merely
the
question
whether
kentucky
has
done
an
adequate
job
of
using
that
protocol?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
we
just
decide
this
on
the
ground...
and
the
record
is
very
persuasive
in
your
favor,
i
have
to
acknowledge...
but
if
we
decide
the
fact
that
kentucky
is
doing
an
adequate
job
of
administering
this
protocol,
that
would
leave
open
the
question
whether
the
basic
use
of
this
second
drug,
which
does
nothing
but
avoid
unpleasantness
of
the
visitors,
is
itself
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
have
to
wait
for
another
case
to
decide
that
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i...
to
be
very
honest
with
you,
i
think
that
you're...
you
make
a
very
strong
case
on
the
administration
in
kentucky
on
the
record
in
this
case,
but
i'm
terribly
troubled
by
the
fact
that
the
second
drug
is
what
seems
to
cause
all
the
risk
of
excruciating
pain,
and
seems
to
be
almost
totally
unnecessary
in
terms
of
any
rational
basis
for
a
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
decide
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
have
been
in
this
very
case,
it
may
be.
but
that
leaves
often
a
whole
other
area
of
litigation,
is
what
troubles
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
no
legislature
has
ever
required
it,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
three-drug
protocol?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we
held
that
that
justification
was
insufficient
to
justify
this
protocol,
it's
hardly
likely
we
would
hold
that
it's
so
serious
and
make
the
whole
procedure
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
interest
in
protecting
the
dignity
of
the
inmate
and
of
the
observers
is
the
justification
for
the
second
drug.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
held
that
that...
that
that
justification
is
insufficient
to
justify
the
protocol,
how
could
we
ever
hold
that
that
justification
is
so
serious
as
to
make
the
whole
procedure
unconstitutional.
