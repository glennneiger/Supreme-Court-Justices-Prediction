mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
kentucky's
lethal
injection
procedures
pose
a
danger
of
cruelly
inhumane
executions.
if
the
first
drug
in
the
three-drug
sequence,
the
anesthetic
thiopental,
is
not
effectively
administered
to
the
executed
inmate,
then
the
second
drug,
pancuronium,
will
induce
a
terrifying
conscious
paralysis
and
suffocation
and
the
third
drug,
potassium
chloride,
will
inflict
an
excruciating
burning
pain
as
it
courses
through
the
veins.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
disagree
with
that
respectfully,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
protocol
simply
does
not
address
several
key
steps
where
risks
can
arise
and,
beyond
that,
the
protocol's...
and
i
think
this
is
critically
important...
the
protocol's
procedures
for
monitoring
to
assure
that
the
inmate
is
adequately
anesthetized
are
practically
nonexistent.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
is
true,
but
there
can
be
no
guarantee
that
it
will
be
properly
administered
and
that
is
because
even
in
clinical
settings
there
are
always...
there
is
always
the
potential
for
difficulty
which
manifests
itself
in
actual
problems,
for
example
in
the
setting
of
an
iv.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if
there
were
a
way
to
guarantee
that
the
procedure
worked
every
time,
then
we
wouldn't
have
substantial
risk.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
if
the
100
percent
of
the
time
the
dose
of
anesthetic
is
properly
administered
into
the
condemned
inmate,
then
we
don't
have
a
significant
risk.
of
course
that
is
not
what
the
record
in
this
case
establishes.
the
record
establishes
the
contrary.
there
is...
you
cannot
assure
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
guarantee
of...
of
successful
administration
of
the
anesthetic.
and
that
is
why
the
monitoring
part
of
the
process
is
so
critical.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
we
have
tried
to
suggest
in
our
brief
that
there
is
a
way
to
monitor
effectively
even
with
the
three-drug
protocol.
it's
challenging.
the
key
component
of
that
is
that
one
needs
a
person
trained
in
monitoring
anesthetic
death
to
participate
in
the
process.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
that's
why
there
is
another
practical
alternative
here,
which
solves
that
problem,
which
is
the
single
dose
of
barbituate,
which
does
not
require
the
participation
of
a
medically
trained
professional.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
justice
alito,
i
do
think
and
i'd
like
to
provide
the
references
where
it
is
raised
and
then
the
evidentiary
references
that
support
the
argument--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
at
page
684
of
the
joint
appendix,
the...
this
is
the
trial
brief,
the
brief
raised
in
the
trial
court...
one
assertion
made
there
is
that
an
alternative
chemical
or
combination
of
chemicals
that
poses
less
risk
of
unnecessary
pain
and
suffering
during
an
execution
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
then...
and
then,
no.
and
then
later,
on
page
701,
the
brief
argues
that
there
are
nonpainful
ways
of
stopping
the
heart.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
thiopental
is
a
barbiturate
and
by
definition
will
inflict
death
painlessly.
the
record
in
this
case
establishes...
each
expert,
the
petitioner
s
expert
and
respondents'
expert,
testified
that
it
is
guaranteed
at
the
three
gram
dose
to
cause
death.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
record
references,
which
i
think
the
record
pretty
clearly
establishes,
your
honor,
that
death
is
certain
to
occur
through
the
use
of
thiopental
at
the
three
gram
dose.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
to
refer
instead
to
the
expert
testimony
in
this
case
which
says
that
death
is
certain
to
occur,
and
in
addition,
that
medical
testimony
in
this
case
that
it
is
certain
to
occur
in
a
very
few
minutes.
those
are
the
transcript
references
that
we
provided
at
page
18
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
it
has
never
been
tried
on
humans.
that
is
correct.
it
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
you
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
by
definition,
barbituates
cannot
inflict
pain
and
do
not
inflict
pain.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
yes
there
would,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
reality
is
that
thiopental
and
other
barbituates
are
anti-convulsives.
their
point
is
to...
among
other
things
to
suppress
any
involuntary
muscle--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
because
to
the
extent
that
the
reason
that
they
are
offering
to
do
it,
is
because
of
the
potential
for
discomfort
that
it
may
cause
the
audience
given
the
risk
that
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
given
the
extent
to
which
it
increases
the
risk
that
there
can
be
ineffective
anesthesia,
and
it
can
go
undetected,
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
be
an
argument
of
sufficient
force
to
justify
using
it
despite
that
risk
particularly
when
it
seems
to
us
that
the
issue
of
dignity
can
be
addressed
by
communication
with
the
audience.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
with
respect
to
the
lingering
death
point,
i
think
it
would,
this
court's
cases
are
talking
about
is
the
consciousness
of
lingering
death
and
the
torture
that
that
imposes,
which
you
wouldn't
have
of
course
in
this
situation.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
credible
argument
that
the
use
of
a
barbituate
alone
could
inflict
pain.
they
do
not
inflict
any
pain.
now,
of
course
there
are
possibilities
of
maladministration,
but
not
maladministration
of
a
one
drug
protocol
that
results
in
any
pain,
and
therefore
there
is
just
not
a
credible
eight
amendment
argument.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
couldn't
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
because
there
is
no
pain.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
monitor
for
anesthetic.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
to
ensure
that
anesthetic
depth
has
been
achieved
and
maintained.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
trained
personnel
could
be
a
physician,
a
nurse
or
anyone
trained
by
them
adequately
in
this
process.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
one
point
of
the
one-drug
protocol,
of
course,
is
to
demonstrate
that
we
are
not
doing
that.
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
can't
have
it
both
ways
with
respect
to
the...
the
issue
of
the
participation
of
medically
trained
personnel.
on
the
one
hand,
they
cannot
say
that
we
have
qualified
medically
able
personnel
participating
in
this
process
and
that's
our
guarantee
of
its
efficacy,
and
on
the
other
hand
say
a
requirement
of
having
trained
qualified
personnel
participate
is
impossible.
and
they
do
say
that.
for
example
the
emts
that
participate
in
kentucky
are
under
the
same
ethical
set
of
issues
as
doctors
are.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
with
additional
training
they
could
be
qualified.
they
aren't
qualified
by
virtue
of
their
training
to
become
emts.
they
would
have
to
be
additionally
trained.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
is
true
justice
souter
that
the
trial
court
did
not
make
factual
findings
on
a
whole
range
of
issues
with
respect
to
the
difficulties
of
constituting
the
proper
dose,
the
risk
of
catheter
placement,
the
risk
of
blowouts,
the
risk
of
mixing
up
syringes,
and
the
adequacy
of
the
monitoring.
and
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
it
did
so
because
it
didn't
believe
that
that
was
particularly
relevant
to
the
issue
before
it.
and
that's
the...
the
basis
of
our
disagreement
with
respect
to
the
legal
test.
now,
it
is...
it
is
our
position
that
the
record
is
sufficiently
clear
and
sufficiently
uncontradicted
on
the
key
points
with
particular
respect
to
monitoring
that
the
court
would
not
have
to
remand
but
it
certainly
would
be
a
reasonable
thing
to
do
in
view
of
the
deficiencies
in
the
actual
findings.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
second,
it's
a
combination.
they
would
use
the
available
equipment,
ekg
and
blood
pressure
cuff
which
is
the
standard
practice
used
for
monitoring
for
unconsciousness,
but
in
addition,
as
the
expert
testimony
in
the
case
established,
you
have
to
have
close...
close
visual
observation
by
the
trained
person.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
there
was
some
question
about
whether
the
third
device
that
this
monitor
is
used
but
the
blood...
the
tracking
of
blood
pressure
is
a
critical
way
of
monitoring
for
unconsciousness
as
is
the
ekg
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there
is
no
slap
in
the
face.
there
is
no
shaking
the
person.
there's
no
testing
of
that
kind
whatsoever
under
the
kentucky
protocol.
so
even
under
that
understanding,
which
we
don't
think
is
correct,
that...
we
don't
have
that
here
and
that's
one
of
the
problems.
all
there
is,
is
visual
observation
by
an
untrained
warden
and
an
untrained
deputy
warden
who
had
testified
in
this
case
that
they
don't
know
what
to
look
for
to
determine
whether
somebody
is
conscious
or
unconscious.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
we
introduced
evidence
that
medically
trained
personnel
were
ready
available,
but
we
did
introduce
evidence
about
what
needed
to
be
done
and,
of
course,
as
i
said,
kentucky
like
the
other
states
had
their
ability
to
bring
medically
qualified
personnel
to
bear
to
run
this
process.
and
so
i
do
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
suggest--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
why
i
suggested
that
there
is...
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
record
here
because
the
undisputed
expert
testimony
on
these
key
issues
shows
the
deficiencies
in
the
protocol.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
each
side's
expert
testified
to
precisely
the
same
thing.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
three
grams
was
certain
to
cause
death.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
record
establishes
that
death
is
certain.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
three
grams
is
a
massive
dose.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
if
one
had
any
doubt
about
the
certainty
of
the
effect
of
causing
death,
one
could
always
just
increase
the
dose.
but
the
record
here
is
that
three
grams--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
there's
anything
in
the
record,
your
honor.
there
is
discussion
in
the
amicus
briefs
about
some
other
jurisdictions
that
have
gone
as
high
as
five
grams.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
because,
as
i've
tried
to
say
earlier,
even
if
there
is
maladministration--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
correct.
but
the
difference
is
if
there's
an
error
at
that
stage
in
the
process
and
the
execution
proceeds,
there
may
be
a
problem
that
needs
to
be
fixed,
but
it
will
not
be
a
problem
that
causes
any
pain,
and
that's
the
critical
difference
because
if
it
doesn't
cause
pain
it
can't
be
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
don't
make
the
argument
that
states
are
required
to
choose
the
least
painful
method
possible.
our
standard
is
grounded
on
three,
i
think,
extremely
solid,
well-established
points
of
eighth
amendment
doctrine.
the
first
one
is
this:
the
core
concern
of
the
eighth
amendment
at
the
time
of
its
founding,
of
course,
was
precisely
the
question
of
whether
the
carrying
out
of
death
sentences
would
inflict
torturous
deaths.
so
we're
at
the
core
of
the
historical
concern.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
the
second
principle,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court's
cases,
including
the
ones
that
your
honor
averted
to,
have
said
that
the
standard
is
whether
the
means
of
execution
inflicts
unnecessary
pain.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
the...
with
all
due
respect,
wilkerson
and
kemmler
say
"unnecessary
pain".
resweber
says
"unnecessary
pain
and"--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
that's
correct,
because--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
because,
justice
scalia,
our
position
is
that
the
pain
that
is
inflicted
here
when
this
goes
wrong
is
torturous,
excruciating
pain
under
any
definition.
we're
not
talking
about
a
slight
increment
different.
we're
talking
about
the
infliction
of
torturous
pain.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
would
have
to
suggest
it
to
the
test
that
we
are
advocating,
which
it
would...
whether
there
is
a
risk
of
torturous
pain.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
it
would
have
to
be
subjected
to
the
test.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if
there
is
a
risk
of
torturous
pain
and
if
there
are
readily
available
alternatives
that
could
obviate
the
risk,
then
any
significant
risk--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
it
would
depend.
the
argument
about
electrocution,
justice
scalia,
is
whether
or
not
it
is
painless,
and
that
was
its
point
when
it
was
enacted,
that
it
would
be
a
painless
form
of
death.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
does
not,
but
that
was
its
point,
and
i
think
one
would
have
to
subject
it
to
the
test
to
see
whether
it
inflicts
severe
pain
that
is
readily
avoidable
by
an
alternative.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
electrocution
may
well.
but
it
would
depend
again,
your
honor.
if
it
could
be
established
that
it
was
painless,
that
there
wasn't
a
risk
that
it
could
go
wrong
in
a
way
that
inflicts
excruciating
pain
then
it
would
be
upheld.
if
it
couldn't,
it
wouldn't.
that
does
seem
a
serious
question.
obviously,
the
court
granted
certiorari
to
consider
it
a
few
terms
ago.
but
that
would
be
the
test,
the
mode
of
analysis
here,
and
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there
is
an
unnecessary
pain
requirement.
there
is
also,
justice
scalia--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--from
this
court's
cases.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
it
comes
from
this
court's
cases.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
more
than
that.
and
pinetti
is
one
case
that
shows
it,
because
there's
a
case
in
which
the
eighth
amendment
forbid
the
execution
of
a
person
who
was
insane
at
the
time
of
execution.
in
that
situation
there
is
no
intent
on
the
part
of
the
people
carrying
out
the
execution
to
inflict
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
this
court
didn't
require
intent
in
pinetti.
in
fact,
it
said
something
quite
different,
really
the
polar
opposite.
it
said
that
the
states
have
to
have
in
place
procedures
to
ensure
that
there
wasn't
an
arbitrary
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
in
that
circumstance,
without
any
requirement
of
intent.
the
gregg-woodson-lockett
cases
don't
have
a
requirement
of
intent,
and
the
kemmler
and
wilkinson
cases
don't
have
a
requirement
of
intent
in
them
either.
with
respect
to
the
"unusual"
character
of
it,
just
drawing
from
the
dictionary
definitions
that
your
honor
posed
in
the
harmline
case,
this
is
unusual
in
precisely
that
way
in
that
it
is,
if
your
honor
will
just
bear
me,
it
is
such
that
does
not
occur
in
ordinary
practice.
so
i
do
think
it's
unusual
in
that
sense.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,

they
have...
they
have
zero
expertise
in
pushing
drugs.
they
have
expertise
in
placing
the
line.
they
have
expertise
in
finding
a
vein.
they
have
no
more
experience
pushing
drugs
than
the
person
who
pushes
the
drugs.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
risk
here
is
real
that
is
why
in
the
state
of
kentucky
it's
unlawful
to
euthanize
animals
in
the
way
that
kentucky
carries
out
its
executions
that's
true
not
only
with
the
use
of
pancuronium,
kentucky
also
says
one
cannot
use
anything
other
than
barbiturates,
one
cannot
use
potassium
unless
someone
trained
in
ensuring
effective
anesthesia
is
participating
in
the
process
and
what
that
is
is
a
marker
that
this
is
a
real
danger
sufficiently
real
that
it's
not
tolerated
with
animals.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
nor
is
it
present
with
respect
to
euthanizing
animals
and
nevertheless
it's
the
danger
of
the
anesthesia
going
wrong
there
can
be
a
torturous
pain
inflicted
that
has
led
veterinarians
after
careful
consideration
to
say
you
have
to
have
somebody
in
the
process
who
is
trained
in
monitoring
anesthetic
death
and
justice
breyer
if
i
could
refer
back
to
your
netherlands
point
my
understanding
is
that
in
the
netherlands
there
is
a
doctor
present
who
is
trained
in
anesthesiology
who
administers
this
whole
process
and
so
the
risk
is
dramatically
different
in
a
situation
where
you
have
that
trained
person
there
than
the
situation
we
have
in
kentucky
now
with
respect
to
the
other
states
and
the
other
so-called
botched
executions
that
my
friend
mr.
englert
referred
to
is
just
not
right
to
say
that
they
were
all
about
cut
downs
and
small
problems.
the
record
finds
a
fact
in
the
morales
case
with
respect
to
the
11
lethal
injection
studied
there,
there
were
evidence
that
six
of
the
eleven
were
inadequately
anesthetized
from
which
one
can
readily
infer
they
would
have
suffered
grave
pain...
and
indeed
the
state's
expert
in
that
case
admitted
it
was
likely
that
one
of
the
eleven
was
not
adequately
anesthetized
at
the
time
that
the
pancuronium
and
potassium
were
put
in
the
system...
similarly
in
the
brown
case
in
north
carolina
of
the
five
lethal
injections
studied
there
the
evidence
credited
by
the
district
court
was
that
with
respect
to
four
of
them
the
condemned
inmate
was
on
the
gurney
gasping
struggling
not
the
kind
of
involuntary
twitching
that
mr.
englert
is
worried
about
but
clear
evidence
that
the
anesthetic
is
not
working...
now
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
case...
with
respect
to
the
lethality
of
thiopental
at
page
492
of
the
joint
appendix
dr.
heath
says
that
thiopental
will
be
lethal
by
itself
three
grams
at
page
494
he
says
indeed
it
will
be
lethal
by
itself
in
virtually
every
case
at
two
grams.
at
page,
at
page
forgive
me
i
don't
have
the
page
number
reference
handy
but
dr.
dershowitz
the
state's
expert
says
the
same
thing
now
the
reference
that
mr.
englert
referred
to
at
page
499
is
where
dr.
heath
is
being
asked
a
question
of
well
would
you
expect
death
to
occur
when
three
grams
are
administered
but
he
is
being
asked
a
series
of
questions
about
administration
in
a
surgical
procedure
which
are
using
ventilators
and
other
procedures
to
keep
the
person
alive
and
he
said
in
that
setting
the
answer
is
no
so
that's
just
not
a
fair
representation
of
the
record
at
all
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
we
ought
to
analogize
this
to
the
deliberate
indifference
standard
and
convictions
of
confinement
cases
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
here
which
is
that
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
is
making
a
deliberate
choice
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
deliberate
choice
here
to
use
chemicals
that
create
this
danger
and
given
that
it
has
done
so
it
ought
to
have
the
commensurate
obligation
to
take
the
reasonable
steps
necessary
to
obviate
the
risk.
