we're

this
case
arises
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
of
1967,
the
adea.
the
petitioner,
federal
express
corporation,
as
is
well-known
here
and
around
the
world,
provides
mail
pickup
and
delivery
services
to
customers
worldwide.
respondents
are
14
current
and
former
fedex
couriers
over
the
age
of
40.
they
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
fedex
had
implemented
productivity
initiatives
that
tied
the
courier's
compensation
and
continued
employment
to
certain
performance,
benchmarks,
for
instance
the
number
of
stops
a
courier
makes
per
day
and
respondents
claim
these
initiatives
violated
the
ada
--
adea.
our
opinion
today
simply
addresses
a
procedural
problem
and
not
that
main
substantive
issue.
the
question
before
us
is
the
timeliness
of
the
suit
filed
by
one
of
the
plaintiffs
below
referred
to
as
the
respondent.
the
district
court
granted
motion
--
petitioner's
motion
to
dismiss.
it
found
that
the
respondent
had
not
filed
an
eeoc
charge
before
she
commenced
the
suit
in
court
and
this
did
not
meet
the
statutory
requirement
according
to
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari.
we
now
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
the
case
presents
two
distinct
questions,
what
is
a
charge
as
the
ada
uses
--
adea
uses
that
term
and
were
the
documents
respondent
filed
in
december
2001,
a
charge.
the
petitioner
urges
--
the
employer
urges
as
to
condition
the
definition
of
charge
enhance
an
employee's
ability
to
sue
upon
the
eeoc's
fulfilling
a
mandatory
duty
to
notify
the
charged
party
and
initiate
a
conciliation
process.
respondent
argues
that
a
charge
need
contain
only
an
allegation
of
discrimination
and
the
name
of
the
employer.
the
eeoc
submits
that
the
proper
test
for
determining
whether
a
filing
as
a
charge
is
whether
the
filing
taken
as
a
whole,
should
be
construed
as
a
request
by
the
employee
for
the
agency
to
take
whatever
action
is
necessary
to
vindicate
her
rights.
the
eeoc
has
adopted
this
position
in
the
governmentâ€™s
amicus
brief
and
in
various
internal
policy
directives
that
it
is
issued
to
its
fielded
officers
over
the
years.
and
in
our
view,
the
agency's
policy
statements
interpret
not
only
the
regulations,
but
also
the
statute
itself.
assuming
these
interpretive
statements
are
not
entitled
full
chevron
deference,
they
are
entitled
to
a
measure
of
respect
under
the
less
deferential,
skidmore
standard.
the
agency's
interpretation
is
and
its
interpretative
position
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
framework
and
we
conclude
as
follows.
in
addition
to
the
information
required
by
the
regulations,
that
is
to
say
an
--
an
allegation
in
the
name
of
the
charged
party,
if
a
filing
is
to
be
deemed
a
charge,
it
must
be
reasonably
construed
as
a
request
for
the
agency
to
take
remedial
action
to
protect
the
employees'
rights,
or
otherwise
settle
the
dispute
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
the
next
question
is
whether
the
filing
here
meets
that
test?
the
agency
says
it
does,
we
agree.
respondent's
completed
intake
form
contained
all
of
the
--
information
outlined
in
the
regulations.
and
the
affidavit
that
the
respondent
submitted
along
with
the
form
is
properly
construed
as
a
request
for
the
agency
to
act.
the
employer's
interest
in
this
case
were
given
a
short
shrift,
for
it
was
not
notified
of
the
complaint
until
the
employee
filed
a
suit.
the
court
adheres
the
merits
of
this
litigation,
can
attempt
to
remedy
of
the
deficiency
by
staying
the
proceedings
to
allow
an
opportunity
for
conciliation
and
settlement.
but
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
establishing
a
clearer,
more
consistent
process
lies
with
the
agency.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
scalia
has
joined.
