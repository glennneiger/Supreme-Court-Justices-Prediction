justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
that...
that
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
argument.
you
say
since...
since
the
eeoc
must
give
notice
when
a
charge
is
filed,
if
it
doesn't
give
notice,
no
charge
has
been
filed.
that
doesn't
make
sense.
i
mean,
it's
just
like
saying,
you
know,
you
have
a
civil
rule,
a
rule
of
civil
procedure,
that
says,
you
know,
after
a
complaint
has
been
filed
there
shall
be
an
answer
within
60
days.
and
if
no
answer
is
filed,
no
complaint
has
been
filed?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
just
doesn't
track.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
give
me
another
one
that
will
enable
me
to
rule
in
your
favor?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
now,
does...
does
the
person
who's
filed
a
proper
charge
know
whether
notice
has
been
given
or
not?
is
a
copy
of
the
notice
always
given
to
the
filer.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
said
it
wasn't
a
charge,
didn't
it?
didn't
it
say
that
it's
not
a
charge?
justice
antonin
scalia
precharge
counseling.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
eliminate
the
whole
purpose
of
the...
of
the
preliminary
document,
to
weed
out
those
charges
that
relate
to
employment
in
france?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
will...
it
will
be
a
charge
even
if
it's
in
france?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
what
it
boils
down
to
is
it'll
be
a
charge
if
we
decide
to
give
notice,
and
it
won't
be
a
charge
if
we
don't
decide
to
give
notice.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
very
nice
for
the
eeoc,
but
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--intake
questionnaire.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
thought
you
said
you
were
deprived
of
something
else.
i
mean,
the
statute
provides
for
a
conciliation
process
in
which
you
can
talk
to
the
employee
and
say,
you
know,
what
happened?
and
you
may
well
be
able
to
satisfy
the
employee
with...
before...
before
she
lawyers
up.
i
think
it's
a
big
disadvantage
to...
to
have
no
contact
with
the
employee
until
there's
a
lawyer
on
the
other
side,
and
you
can't
talk
to
her
confidentially;
you
can't
make
a
conciliation
notice.
i
think
that's
a
considerable
disadvantage,
and
it's...
it's
a
situation
that
the
statute
did
not
envision.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
you
can't
conciliate
after
suit
anyway.
you
can
negotiate
with
the
lawyer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
other
side.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
is
your
test?
when
is
it
a
charge?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
don't
tell
me
when
notice
is
given.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
goodness.
it's
like
saying
there's
no
complaint
until
an
answer
is
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
not
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
only
because
i'm
sane.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
can't
be
equitable
tolling
unless
she
has
really
filed
a
charge.
so
sooner
or
later...
you
cannot
run
away
from
it...
you're
going
to
have
to
give
us
a
definition
of
what
a
charge
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
only
going
to
give
her
equitable
tolling
if
in
fact
she's,
she's
filed
a
charge.
and
you
don't
give
me
any...
unless
you
want
to
fall
back
on
the
manifest
destiny
rule
or...--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
after
the
real
charge
was
filed
or
what
everybody
concedes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
charge
form.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
suit
was
pending
at
that
time.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
pretty
risky.
justice
antonin
scalia
answer
my
question.
was
suit
already
filed
at
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
i'm
sorry.
247
during
that
whole
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
number
of
mistakes
they
have
made;
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
astounded
if
that's
the
only
number
of
mistakes
they
made,
from
19--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
with
respect
to
fed
ex.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's...
what's
wrong
with
this?
why
don't
i...
i
mean,
i
do
believe
that
the
thing
either
is
a
charge
or
isn't
a
charge
before
the
eeoc
decides
whether
it's
going
to
give
notice
or
not.
it
either
is
or
isn't.
now,
what
about
this:
it
is
a
charge
if
it
reasonably
appears
to
be
a
charge,
or
if
you
want
to
say
"manifest
intent",
that's
okay,
too.
now,
if
you
signed
a
document
which...
which
says
that
it
is
a
prefiling
document
and
the
purpose
is
to
discuss
a
future
charge,
it
seems
to
me
you
know,
or
ought
to
know,
that
this
is
not
a
charge.
and
we
can't
run
the
system
for
people
who
are
either
illiterate
or
don't
even
have
friends
who
are
literate.
we
can't
run
a
system
that
way.
so
i
look
at
this,
and
i
say
this
is
not
a
charge.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
the
eeoc
chooses
to
give
notice,
then
i
guess
you
could
say
one
that's
close
to
the
boundary
line
becomes
a
charge
retroactively,
and
there
is...
there
is
no
harm
done.
you
can
have
the
counseling,
and
so
forth.
but
when
you
come
in
with
something
that
doesn't
look
like
a
charge,
it
seems
to
me
if
there
is
no
notice
given
and
you
get
into
the
situation
that
is
here
where
the
company
has
been
deprived
of
the
conciliation
opportunity,
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
preserve
evidence
and
whatnot,
it
seems
to
me
the
fault
should
lie
on
your
client,
because
she
filed
something
that
any
reasonable
person
should
know
is
not
a
charge.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
it
was,
this
thing
says
it's
a
precharge
document.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
think...
why
do
you
think
they
must
have
lost
it?
why
did
you
think
they
must
have
lost
it:
because
she
hadn't
been
given
a
number?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
they
treat
it
as
a
charge,
they
don't
docket
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
think
the
problem
here
is
the
eeoc,
rather
than
anybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does,
indeed,
have
this
form
which
says...
which
says
that
its
purpose...
information
provided
on
this
form
will
be
used
by
commission
employees
to
determine
the
existence
of
the
facts
relevant
to
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
and
to
provide
such
precharge
filing
counseling,
blah,
blah,
blah.
all
of
that,
however,
is
contained
as
part
of
the
privacy
act
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
the
filer
is
not
interested
in
keeping
any
of
it
confidential,
i
wouldn't
even
read
the
privacy
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
kind
of
an
agency
is
this?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
that
appear?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
its
very
definition
of
a
"charge",
it
says
a
charge
shall
be
in
writing
and
shall
name
the
prospective
respondent
and
shall
generally...
shall
generally
allege
the
discriminatory
acts.
that's
what
it
must
contain.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that
anything
that
contains
that
is
a
charge.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
could
write
out
something
that
contains
all
three
of
those
things.
would
that
be
a
charge?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
let's
try
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
all
intake
questionnaires
are
a
charge,
because
they
all
contain
that.
i
mean
that
definition
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the...
with
the
agency's
assertion
that
it
has
something
called
an
intake
questionnaire
which
does
not
constitute
a
charge
unless...
i
don't
know...
unless
there's
manifest
whatever
it
is.
that's
inconsistent
because
all
of
those
intake
questionnaires
contain
all
of
that
information--
justice
antonin
scalia
--set
forth
in
26.3.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
heytens,
let
me
tell
you
going
in
that
my...
my
main
concern
in
this
case,
however
the
decision
comes
out,
is
to
do
something
that
will
require
the
eeoc
to
get
its
act
in
order,
because
this
is
nonsense:
these
regulations
that
are
contradicted
by
forms;
this
failure
to
give
notice,
but
it's
okay
because
it's
a
charge
anyway.
this
whole
situation
can
be
traceable
back
to
the
agency,
and
i...
whoever
ends
up
bearing
the
burden
of
it,
it's
the
agency's
fault,
and
this
scheme
has
to
be
revised.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
within
10
days
of
the
charge,
but
that
assumes,
it
seems
to
me,
what's
to
be
proven.
i
mean
what
is
the
charge?
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
the
prefiling,
the
intake
thing,
is
not
a
charge,
there
is
no
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
not
make
that
not
a
charge
by
saying
in
bold
letters
on
the
top:
this
is
not
a
charge.
if
you
want
a
charge,
ask
for
form
5?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
the
courts
have
to
struggle
with
this
when
the
agency
could
put
in
bold
letters
at
the
top:
this
is
a
charge
or
this
is
not
a
charge?
why
do
federal
district
judges
have
to
inquire
into
manifest
intent
from
now
until
doomsday?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that
in
cfr?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
heytens,
what's
your
solution
for
the
situation
where
the
eeoc
treats
it
as
a
charge,
but
doesn't
give
notice,
which
is
what
has
happened
here?
how
do
you
think
that
should
play
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
fix
it?
you
haven't
gotten
notice,
you
haven't
had
a
chance
to
conciliate...
how
do
we
fix
it?
