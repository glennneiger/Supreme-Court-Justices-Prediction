well,
eeoc
form
5
is
labelled
"charge".
and
would
it
be
your
position
that
if
an
employee
filled
out
that
form
and
submitted
it
to
the
eeoc,
but
the
eeoc
made
a
mistake
and
did
not
notify
the
employer,
that
that
would
not
be
a
charge?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
employee
files
an
intake
questionnaire
but
not
a
form
5,
would
you
say
that
there
would
be
equitable
tolling,
or
would
you
say
that
the
employee
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
equitable
tolling
because
the
employee
didn't
file
the
right
form?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
much
difference
between
the
substance
of
these
two
forms,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
form
5,
i
think,
requires
a
listing
of
the
number
of
employees
that
the
employer
has.
what...
they
basically
cover
the
same
ground.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
point
of
these
statistics?
to
show
that
conciliation
wouldn't
have
done
any
good?
is
that
what
you--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
if
the
person
fills
out
an
intake
form,
checks
the
box
that
says
"i
do
not
consent
to
have
my
employer
notified?
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
an
employee
files
something
like
that
and
says
i
don't
consent
to
notification
of
the
employer,
can
that
be
a
charge?
