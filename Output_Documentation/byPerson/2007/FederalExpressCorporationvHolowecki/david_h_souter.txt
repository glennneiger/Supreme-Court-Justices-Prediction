justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
should
the...
the
filing
fee
penalty,
in
effect,
go
to
the
plaintiff
when
it
wasn't
the
plaintiff's
fault?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you
to
this
extent:
as
i
understand
it,
if...
your
position,
if
the
plaintiff
had
filed
on
form
5
and
the
eeoc
had
done
nothing
and
the
plaintiff
then
brought
suit,
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
is
it...
how
is
it
new?
i
thought
that
you
argued
for
that
test
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
didn't...
didn't
your
brief
say
that
was
the
appropriate
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you...
i
know
you're
bound
by
precedent,
but
if
you
think
it's
wrong,
you
can
say
it's
wrong.
and,
as
i
understand,
you
did
not
say
it
was
wrong;
you
adopted
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
may
be
none,
but
if
the...
if
the
employee
indicates
by
the
box
checked
that
the
employee
does
not
want
the
company
to
know
that
the
employee
is
making
whatever
this
is,
this
statement--
justice
david
h.
souter
--how
can
it
be
regarded
as
a
charge
against
the
employer
which
sets
in
effect
a
litigation
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
okay
because
on
that
criterion
your...
your
client
said,
yes,
you
can
tell
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
