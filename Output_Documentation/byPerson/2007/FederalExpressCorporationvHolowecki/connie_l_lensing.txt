ms.
connie
l.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
clearly
set
out
a
statutory
scheme
in
which
timely
notice
and
the
opportunity
for
conciliation
are
required
before
an
age
discrimination
private
suit
may
be
brought.
while
our
position
is
that
reading...
the
reading
of
adea
section
626(d)
as
a
whole
shows
that
"charge"
encompasses
notice,
even
if
that
definition
is
too
broad
and
you
accept
only
a
content
definition
of
"charge",
it
is
clear
from
the
structure
of
the
statute
that
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
conciliate
before
a
lawsuit
commences
is
required.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
we
think
the
better
rule
is
that
it
would
not
be
a
charge
until
notice
is
given,
because
that's
the
only
rule
that
is
faithful
to
the
statute,
that
notice
is
required.
but
equitable
tolling
is
available
for
such
a
mistake
and
that's
the
exact
situation
in
which
equitable
tolling
should
be
used,
to
rectify
a
true
mistake
on
the
eeoc's
part
at
the
time,
rather
than
what
they
have
been
engaging
in
of
late,
which
is
second
guessing
the
decision
made
at
the
time.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well,
justice
ginsburg,
to
begin
with,
the
plaintiff
never
requested
that
the
court
do
that.
but
in
a
broader
sense,
it's
not
the
proper
thing
to
do
because
there's
a
very
big
difference
in
conciliation
after
notification
and
before
a
lawsuit
has
been
filed.
there
is...
the
emphasis
is
on
let's
get
this
conciliated,
if
possible.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well,
congress
believed
that
notice
and
a
chance
to
conciliate
without
a
lawsuit
was
the
proper
way
for
this
to
be
done,
and
there
is
a
difference
in
efforts
to
conciliate
before
and
after
a
lawsuit
is
filed.
and
if--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--i
think
it
could
be
dismissed
without
prejudice.
i
think
that
that's
fine,
because
then
you
would
have
an
opportunity,
as
in
this
case
where
there
is
a
proper
charge,
to
have
that
period
of
conciliation,
and
the
plaintiff
would
not
be
out
anything
other
than
the
filing
fee,
which
the
employer
is
out
a
little
bit,
too,
because
the
employer
never
got
a
prompt
notice
at
the
time
of
the
first
situation.
but
the
biggest
reason--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--well,
you
know,
i
would
submit
that
perhaps
it
is
the
plaintiff's
fault
when
the
plaintiff
does
not
do
everything
a
plaintiff
can
to
be
sure
that
a
charge
is
filed.
this
particular
form,
for
instance,
stated
that
it
is
for...
pre
charge
counseling
is
the
purpose,
and
that
it's
to
determine
potential
charges.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
that
is
true,
and
equitable
tolling
is
available.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well,
justice...
sorry.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
justice
scalia,
i
understand
your
hesitancy
to
accept
our
definition
of
"charge"
as
including
notice,
but
the
other
view--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--it
is...
it
is
just
as
true
and
the
results
are
just
the
same
if
you
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
you
uphold
the
sense
of
the
statute
and
you
understand
that
the
requirement
before
bringing
a
suit,
whether
or
not
notice
is
part
of
the
definition
of
"charge".
but
there
is
a
requirement
under
the
statute
that
notice
and
an
effort
to
conciliate
be
made
before
the
suit
is
brought.
so
understanding
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
upholding
that
purpose,
that
it's
a
requirement,
an
indispensable
prerequisite
to
a
lawsuit,
is
a
different
way
of
getting
to
the
same
result.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
i
don't
know
if
it
always
is.
certainly
when
it's
not
given,
it
is
not.
but,
yes,
i
think
the
person
easily
can
contact
or
find
out
from
the
eeoc,
what
is
happening
with
my,
what
she
believes
or
may
not
believe
is
a
charge.
in
this
particular
case,
certainly
she
did
within
the
time
limits
because
she
filed
a
charge
later.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well,
i
think
that
the,
the
practice
has
been
so
inconsistent
and
that's
part
of
the
problem.
two
field
agents
in
this
particular
case,
one
in
'01
and
one
in
'02,
because
she
submitted
the
questionnaire
twice,
two
field
agents
did
decide
that
it
was
not
a
charge
and
did
not
treat
it
as
a
charge...
no
charge
number,
no
notice.
they
decided
it
was
not
a
charge.
and
so
no
form
5--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
website
says,
for
instance,
until
2
months
ago...
for
2-1/2
years
the
web
site,
which
is
probably
the
way
the
agency
gets
out
information
to
more
people
and
more
employees
than
any
other
way,
says
when
the
completed
signed
form
5
is
received
back
in
the
field
office--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--well,
this...
right.
received
back
in
the
field
office...
in
this
case,
for
instance,
both
the
questionnaire
and
the
charge
were
filled
out
by
her,
by
the,
by
the
employee.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
it...
the
form
does
say,
the
form
that
she
filled
out,
the
intake
questionnaire,
does
say
that
someone
will
talk
with
you
after
you
fill
this
out.
it
does
not
say
that
they
will
fill
out
the
charge.
in
our
experience
the
charge
is
very
often
filled
out
by
the
employee.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
yes,
it
did.
well,
it
did
not
say
that
this
is
not
a
charge,
which
i
think
would
be
a
better
practice
if
it
did
say
that
in
the
future.
but
it
said
the
purpose
of
this
is
for
precharge
counseling--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--and
for
determination
whether
we
have
jurisdiction
over
potential
charges.
so
we
think
the
plain
language
of
the
form--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--we
do
not
know,
or
i
do
not
know.
it
is
not
in
the
record.
you're
correct.
the
problem
is,
is
that
the
practice
at
eeoc
has
been
so
inconsistent,
both
the,
what
they
call
a
charge,
what
they
recognize
as
a
charge,
and
their
treatment
of
documents
as
a
charge.
again,
the
web
site
clearly
says
a
form
5
that
is
signed
and
completed
and
received
back
in
the
field
office
is
a
charge.
that
is
when
your
charge
is
filed.
and
yet
we
have
two
memos
that
went
out,
one
after
the
edelman
case
and
one
after
the
opening
brief
in
this
case,
to
field
agents
that
say,
no,
you're
supposed
to
use
this
manifest
intent
test.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
the
plaintiff
does
not
lose.
and
that
is
the
difference
in
this
situation
and
the
logan
case,
which
the
government,
i
think,
and
also
the
respondent
have
cited.
the
plaintiff
does
not
lose,
because
equitable
tolling
is
available.
now,
in
our
case--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
where
equitable
tolling
comes
in.
that's
the
purpose
of
equitable
tolling.
if
the
situation
is
that
you
have
missed
the
time
to
file
the
charge,
either
the
180
or
the
300
days,
equitable
tolling
saves
from
you
that.
in
other
words,
you
can
now
file
the
charge.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
ms.
kennedy
didn't
need
equitable
tolling,
because
in
this
case
she
caught
the
situation
before
the
time
ran
and
she
filed
a
charge.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
she
chose
not
to
file
a
lawsuit
based
on
that
charge,
and
she
decided
to
do
that
for
quite
some
time.
she
did
finally
get...
you
know,
once
the
charge
was
filed,
the
eeoc
recognized
it
as
a
charge,
they
gave
notice
to
us,
the
employer.
they
began
the
time--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--well,
not
after
the
lawsuit
was
dismissed,
your
honor.
i
mean
after
the
lawsuit
was
dismissed,
she
got
the
right
to
sue
letter
and
she
still
did
not
bring
a
lawsuit.
she
had
90
days
from
the
right
to
sue
letter
and
she
still
did
not
bring
a
lawsuit.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
pardon
me?
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
yes,
your
honor.
but,
you
know,
the
equitable
tolling
is
not
needed
where
you
file
within
the
180
or
300
days.
all
you
have
to
do
is
file
a--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--we
were
in
a
lawsuit,
your
honor,
and
so
that
sort
of
changes
everything.
we
can't,
we
can't
talk
to
her.
we
can't...
you
know,
the
discovery
process
is
what
you
then
would
use
to
investigate,
rather
than
an
informal
investigation.
and
that
never
occurred
and
that's
part
of
the
problem
here,
because
we
spent
a
long,
long
time
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
it
was
finally
dismissed.
then
it
was
on
appeal,
and
it's
still
on
appeal.
so
we
haven't
had
that
opportunity,
although
she
is
a
current
employee;
that
this
has
been
in
litigation,
and
that
changes
the
face
of
conciliation
completely.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
i
think
that
unless
she
was
relying
on
the
eeoc,
and
there
have
been
cases
like
that
in
which
the
eeoc
says,
the
field
agent
says,
that's
all
you
need
to
do,
this
is
a
charge
and
notice
is
going
to
issue.
if
that
were...
if
there
were
some
evidence
of
that
in
the
record,
which
of
course
this
record
is
completely
silent.
the
plaintiff
chose
to
put
no
information
in
about
whether
she
believed,
didn't
believe
or
what
she
was
relying
on.
but
in
a
situation
where
the
eeoc
misleads
her,
yes.
i
would
certainly
say
no
in
a
situation
where
the
form
clearly
says
that
it's
precharge.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
there
is
very
little
difference,
you're
exactly
right,
in
the
information
requested.
the
difference
is
that
one
is
an
intake
questionnaire
and
not
a
charge,
and
the
other
is
a
charge.
and
the
eeoc,
which
we
think
is
a
good
idea,
has
had
a
multistep
process,
so
that
lay
people
that
come
in
and
say,
you
know,
i
have
this
charge
of
discrimination,
it
happened
to
me
when
i
was
working
in
france,
they
can
go
through
those
and
say
that's
not,
that's
not
a
charge,
and
they
can
read
through
them
and
not
have
to
process
everything
as
a
charge.
that's
the
reason
for
the
intake
questionnaire.
but
it
is
simply
giving
the
information
to
the
eeoc
and
not
a
charge,
and
must
be
treated,
must
be
treated
differently.
you
know,
going
back,
justice
ginsburg,
because
i
don't
think
i
ever
finished
the
answer
to
your
question
some
time
ago.
one
of
the
problems
with
staying
the
lawsuit
is
if
that
were
the
answer,
then
we
would
be
doing
away
with
presuit
notice,
because
anybody
could
go
in
on
an
intake
questionnaire
a
year
later
because,
remember,
nothing
is
happening
to--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--but
that
is
the
problem.
if
you...
they
are
routinely
not
giving
notice
of
intake
questionnaires,
and
they
are
not
supposed
to.
we
agree
with
them.
and
twice
this
happened.
and
only
5
years
later
after
it
got
to
this
court
did
the
eeoc
write
a
memo
and
say,
oh,
those
field
agents
were
wrong.
but
we
need
to
take
the
opinion
of
the
eeoc
at
the
time.
and
of
course
this
was
a
very
reliable,
very
justified
opinion
of
the
field
agents
because
it
clearly
said
on
the
form
it
was
precharge.
but
if
you...
if
you
just
say
the
lawsuit,
that
means
that
anybody
that
files
an
intake
questionnaire
can
come
in
2
years
later
because
it's
not
being
processed,
so
no
notice
to
sue
letter
will
ever
go
out,
and
so
there
is
no
end
to
the
statute.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well,
that's...
that's
an
interesting
form
because
that
means
it
you
come
in
the
day
after
the
act
of
discrimination,
that
form
is
filled
out;
it
is
neither
a
complaint
nor
a
charge.
who
knows
what
it
is
until
300
days
run.
so
at
the
end
of
300
days,
if
the...
if
the
complainant
has
not
filed
another
writing,
then
there...
there
can
be
no
prompt
notice.
then
it
is...
has
morphed
into
a
charge;
then
there
can
be
no
prompt
notice
to
the
employer.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
but
they
won't
know
if
it's
a
charge
until
the
entire
time
runs,
to
know
if
it's
the
only
timely
filed
document,
because
it
says
it's
only
a
charge
if
you
don't
file
anything
else
on
time.
you
have
300
days
to
do
that.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
if
it's
the
only
timely
document
filed--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--means
that
no
other
document
within
the
time
period,
which
is
300
days.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
in
deferral
stage.
yes.
that's
the
form,
yes,
your
honor,
the
form
in
footnote
3,
i
believe,
of
the
eeoc's
brief.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
i'm
sorry.
footnote
2,
i
think,
on
page
3.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
this
will
be
a
charge,
if
no
other
timely
allegation
of
discrimination
is...
is
filed.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
it
does.
it
does
completely.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
right.
it
should
be.
now,
i
think
the
practical
matter
is,
justice
scalia,
that
if
nobody
does
anything
ever...
you
don't
file
suit,
you
don't
try
to
rely
on
it...
they
don't
give
notice
and
they
don't--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--exactly.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
which
can
only
happen
at
the
end
of
a
long
period
of
time,
which
means
that
the
notice
will
not
be
prompt.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well,
the...
the
regulations
are
certainly
entitled
to
deference,
and
taken
as
a
whole,
the
regulations,
just
as
the
statutes,
require
notice.
but
what
the
eeoc's
position
is,
is
the
regulations
that
describe
what
a
charge
is
are
not
enough,
and
the
entire
definition
is
not
embodied
in
the
regulations.
you
have
to
go
to...
to
memos
we
wrote
and
to
a
compliance
manual,
which
is
not
in
the
record
and
is
not
attached
to
the
brief
and
is
not
available
to
employees
or
most
lawyers,
readily.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--well,
i
agree
if
we
get
the
notice,
we
cannot
complain.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
i...
i--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--justice
breyer,
i
agree.
if,
for
instance,
a
plaintiff
gave
us
the
notice
and
the
eeoc
didn't...
didn't
file
it,
i
agree,
because
notice
is
the
important
thing;
but
that's
not
what
happened.
that
is
just
simply
not
what
happened.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
intake
questionnaire.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
if
they
treat
it
as
a
charge
and
give
notice,
i
have
no
problem.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well,
where
do
you...
the
problem
is
that
there
no
place
to
complain.
you
didn't
get
notice;
you
didn't
get
a
chance
to
conciliate;
the
entire--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--exactly.
if
you're
not,
it
doesn't
matter.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well
it's...
it's
the
situation
where
you
are
hurt
that's
the
problem.
the
problem
is
that
we
need
a
better
rule
that's
faithful
to
the
statute,
where
notice
is
given.
and--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--we
didn't
have
prompt
notice.
we
could
not
investigate--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--well,
we
don't--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
only
prejudice,
and
this
is
what
somewhat
speculatory
because
it
did
not
happen;
but
generally
if
you
have
prompt
notice,
particularly
without
a
lawsuit,
you
can
investigate;
and
if
you
don't
have
prompt
notice,
sometimes
you
have
destroyed
documents
in
the
regular
course
of
your
business
that
are
helpful
to
you.
that
has
happened
to
us.
you
have
employees
who
are
witnesses
who
are
gone;
you
don't
know
where
they
are.
you
have
all
sorts
of
things
that--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--do
i
believe
that's
true
in
this
case?
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
that
is
true.
had...
had
this...
well,
the
charge,
the
only
timely
charge
we
did
get
notice
of,
and
so
if
there
had
not
been
a
lawsuit
we
could
have
investigated,
and
you're
a
little
bit
estopped
from
the
investigation
when
a
lawsuit
is
pending
because
you've
got
rules
of
discovery
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--and
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
i
think
they
did...
the
statute
did
envision
it
because
it
does
require
prompt
notice.
that's...
that's
exactly
where
i
was
going
next,
is
it's
notice
for
investigation
and
the
opportunity
to
conciliate
without
a
lawsuit
pending.
and
particularly
in
this
suit
and
in
many
others
now,
when
you
have
the
piggyback
situation,
a
plaintiff
is
in
a
lawsuit
and
others
are
attempting
to
piggyback
off
of
her
charge,
she
may
not
at
that
point
feel
that
she
can
conciliate
just
for
her...
herself;
but
before
suit,
that
is
a
very
good
situation.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
right.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
didn't
finish
the
question
you
had
asked
me
about
deference
in
the
auer
case.
the
auer
case
is
an
interpretation
of
a
regulation,
and
in
this
case
the
regulation
says
nothing
about
manifest
intent,
and
that
is
just
a
wholly
new
situation
that--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--well,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
the
test
had
been
administered
by
other
courts
which
required
evidence--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--because
in
that
court
we
were
bound
by
precedent
and
that
was
the
test,
but
we
said--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--well,
we...
the
manifest
intent
test
that
we
talked
about
was
the
one
the
courts
have
used,
which
is
the
situation
we
were
talking
about,
where
equitable
tolling
should
occur.
and
that
is
where
you
have,
in
the
record,
reliance
on
the
eeoc
that
you've
done
everything
you
need
to
do
and
this
is
a
charge.
that
is
not
the
case
under
the
second
circuit's
ruling,
where
they
just
say:
just
look
at
the
document
and
if
you
think
that
she
wanted
you
to
file
a
charge,
that's
enough.
that's
a
very
different
intent
test
than
the
other
courts
accept.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
when
notice--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well...
i'm
not...
and
that's
what
i'm
saying--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--but...
but
notice
is
required
for
the
suit.
so,
while
a
charge
may
be
a
charge
before
notice
is
given,
and
i
understand
your
reluctance
to
accept
that
definition,
but--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--a
point
well
taken.
we
still...
we
still
get
to
the
same
place
if
you...
if
you
accept
the
position
that
notice
is
required
in
the
statute
and
suit
can't
be
brought.
maybe
there
is
a
minimal
charge,
but
suit
cannot
be
brought
on
that
minimal
charge
until
notice
is
given,
is
a
more
sane
way
to
put
it.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
the
burden
is
on
the
eeoc,
and
that
is
why
there's
equitable
tolling.
but
the
plaintiff
needs
to
demonstrate
in
the
record
she's
done
everything
she
can.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
a
charge--
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
--no.
a
charge
needs
to
clearly
delineate
that
it's
a
charge.
and
i
think
the
eeoc
could
do
that
if
they
knew
they
had
to
live
by
that,
and
then
we're
perfectly
happy
with
the
eeoc
defining
"charge"
as
long
as
they
consistently
define
it
and
give
us
notice.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
first
of
all,
in
this
case
the
affidavit
attached
to
the
intake
questionnaire
began...
and
this
is
at
joint
appendix
266...
with
the
statement,
"i
have
been
assured
of
confidentiality
by
the
eeoc.
"
so
it
is
a
confidentiality
concern.
congress
determined
that
there
must
be
an
opportunity
for
conciliation
before
a
lawsuit
was
filed.
we
never
saw
the
numbers
that
are
not
in
the
record,
that
were
testified
to
today,
but
if
247
charges
were
filed
against
fed
ex,
in
that
period
of
time
we
had
25
age
discrimination
cases.
so
conciliation
before
a
case
does
work.
and
i
appreciate
those
numbers
because
it...
it
just
shows
that
we
conciliate,
we
look
into
it,
but
you
can't
do
it
once
the
lawsuit
is
filed.
the
best
rule
obviously
are
the
clear
forms
that
many
of
you
have
mentioned
today.
one
can
say
it's
not
a
charge.
the
other
one
can
say
it
is
a
charge,
and
this
could
all
be
a
situation
where
you'd
have
only
rare
occurrences
where
notice
was
not
given.
ms.
connie
l.
lensing
well,
this
particular
case,
she
could...
may
i
answer?
she
could
have
filed
her
lawsuit,
she
had
a
charge.
she
chose
not
to
file
a
subsequent
lawsuit
60
days
later.
this
lawsuit
was
properly
dismissed.
the
opportunity
to
file
another
lawsuit
was
there.
she
didn't
need
equitable
tolling
because
she
caught
it
and
she
filed
a
charge,
indisputable,
and
we
did
get
notice
of
the
charge
in
july.
i
think
it
was
filed
the
very
end
of
may;
we
got
it
in
july.
thank
you.
