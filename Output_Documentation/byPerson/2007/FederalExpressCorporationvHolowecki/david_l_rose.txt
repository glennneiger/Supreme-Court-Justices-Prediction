mr.
david
l.
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
initially.
and
i'll
make
them
briefly,
and
i'll
try
not
to
re
cover
the
ground
that's
been
covered
by
a
number
of
the
questions.
the
first
major
point
is
that
the
statute
and
the...
well,
this
has
been
made
sort
of...
the
statute
and
the
regulations
state
that,
after
a
charge
has
been
filed,
the
responsibility
for
sending
the
notice
and
docketing
the
case
is
upon
the
commission.
it's
not
on
the
aggrieved
individual.
the
argument
that
a
petitioner
has...
the
charging
party,
excuse
me,
or
aggrieved
individual
has
a
duty
to
provide
notice
is
just
absolutely
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
as
justice
scalia
was
just
stating.
i
want
to
make
a
second
point
which
ha
also
been
alluded
to
by,
i
think,
justice
breyer
and
others.
the
petitioner
suffered
no
harm
from
the
fact
ms.
kennedy
filed
a
form
283
rather
than
a
form
5,
which
is
entitled
eeoc
did
not
give
prompt
notice
to
the
defendant
federal
express,
the
petitioner
here,
on
may
30th.
eeoc
did
not
send
the
notice
of
the
filing
of
the
charge
until
sometime
after
august
20th,
2002.
that
is,
it
was
more
than
60
days.
so
that
even
though
the
charge
was
filed
and...
eeoc
did
absolutely
nothing
with
it.
no
notice.
and
it's
in
the
appendix,
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
294-296.
mr.
david
l.
rose
form
5.
mr.
david
l.
rose
the
charge
form
5
was
file
on...
well,
she
signed
it
on
the
30th.
it
may
have
been
filed
a
couple
of
days
later.
but
whatever
it
was,
that
was
submitted.
i
sent
it
to
the
eeoc
by,
i
think,
fed
ex.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
used
fed
ex--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--i
used
fed
ex
for
a
record
because
i
can
use
their
tracking.
some
of
the
tracking
documents
are
in
the
joint
appendix.
i
dealt
with...
i
dealt
with
fed
ex
in
the
bost
case.
i
call
it
bost.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
bosst>
["]
or
boest>
["].
he
calls
himself
tony,
so
i
don't
know.
in
any
event--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--yes,
sir.
suit
had
been
filed
earlier.
mr.
david
l.
rose
all
right,
let
me
address
your
question,
if
i
may.
there
is
a
period
for
conciliation.
we
have
records
from
the
eeoc
which
we
sent
copies
of
to
opposing
counsel
by
email
yesterday,
and
perhaps
we
should
have
done
it
earlier,
that
show
that
something
like
240...
i
may
have
the
wrong
number...
over
200
cases
that
were
filed...
charges,
excuse
me,
by
eeo...
filed
by
employees
of
fed
ex
with
the
eeoc.
not
one
had
been
conciliated
from
1997
through
2005.
not
one.
zero.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no.
that's
the
only
mistakes
that
we
know
that
eeoc
made
with
respect
to...
i'm
not
saying
that
all
of
them
should
have
been
served
or
anything
like
that,
but
there
were--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--no,
no.
this
is
only
with
respect
to
fed
ex.
mr.
david
l.
rose
and
it's
age
claims.
mr.
david
l.
rose
that
date
is...
i
had
to
ask
for
it,
but
it
is
public,
and
i
checked
again
yesterday
with
counsel
for
the
eeoc,
which
i'm
also
representing
here
today.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
it's
relevant
because
this
is
a
complaint
that
was
dismissed
before
any
evidence
was
taken,
and
therefore
any
set
of
facts
that's
alleged
in
the
complaint
is
assumed
to
be
true
for
purposes
of
its
trial
b
motion.
so
there
was
no
discovery.
we
didn't
have
a
chance
to
do
any
discovery.
the
district
court
threw
us
out
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
it
was
morphed
into
a
summary
judgment
motion
functionally,
but
on
the
very
limited
topic
of
what
there
was.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
and,
furthermore,
i
cite
to
you
the
fact
that
since--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--eeoc
does
very
little
within
2
months,
your
honor,
of
anything,
of
receipt
of
the
charge.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no.
i
think
conciliation
is
important.
i
think
what...
if
this
is
treated
as
the
charge,
as
i
think
it
should
be,
under
the
definition
in
the
regulation,
it's...
it's
in
16...
29
cfr
1626.
it's
in
3.6
and
8(b)
of
that
regulation.
the
original
document
is
a
charge
because
it
identified
the
respondent,
identified
the
kind
of
discrimination,
and
the
person
signed
it.
that's
all
that's
needed
under
the
regulation.
that
regulation
is
lawful.
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
think
that's
a
question
that's
not
presented
here,
and
i
think
that's
a
question
that
is
best...
best
left
to
eeoc.
the...
that
form
says
on
it
that
we
don't...
you
don't
need
to
let
us
notify.
there's
a
footnote
or
something.
we
don't...
you
don't
need
to
let
us...
you
don't
need
to
agree
at
this
stage--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--right.
mr.
david
l.
rose
your
honor,
i
differ
on
this.
i
think
many
reasonable
persons
don't
know
what
a
charge
is,
particularly
if,
like
miss
kennedy,
she
had
never
filed
a
charge
before.
and
just
let
me
complete
it
if
i
may.
she
had
never
filed
a
charge
before.
she
had
never
complained.
she
had
tried
to
complain
internally,
but
she
had
never
filed
a
charge
before.
she
didn't
know
what
it
was.
i--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--your
honor,
it
says...
if
you
look
at
the
two
part
form,
it's
very
small
writing.
it's
at
the
bottom.
it
doesn't
say
it's
a
precharge
form.
it
says
the
purpose
of
this
questionnaire
is
to
solicit
information
to
enable
the
commission
to
avoid
mistakes.
and
then
it
says
routine
uses,
and
it
says
potential
charges,
complaints
or
allegations,
and
to
provide
counseling--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--it's
two...
i'm
sorry.
it's
265,
i
believe,
(j)
265,
it's
the
two
page
printout.
and
the
handwriting
is
her
handwriting
on
the
top.
that's
a
xerox
of
her
handwriting.
justice
scalia,
i
would
further
add
that
i...
she
was
not
my
client
when
she
filled
this
out,
as
this
document
makes
clear,
because
she
checked
the
box
"not
represented".
by
the
time
i
asked
her
if
she
had
filed
a
charge,
and
she
said,
oh,
yes,
i
went
and
got
the
document
from
the
eeoc,
and
i
sent
it
in.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no.
but...
but
it
is,
your
honor...
this
is
in
the
complaint,
the
facts
that
are
supposed
to
be
alleged.
as
we
said
in
the
complaint,
that
the
parties
had
given
notice
to
eeoc
of
the
overall
system.
incidentally,
there
is
another
respondent
named
robertson,
who
did
have
a
live
charge
and
a
right
to
sue
letter
which
was
running
out,
which
is
why
we
filed
this
in
may
rather
than
in
june
or
july.
i
also...
i
think
i
said
that
eeoc
did
not,
in
fact,
give
notice
to
eeoc...
to
fed
ex
until
sometime
after
august
20th,
which
was
much
more
than
60
days
from
the
filing
of
the
charge.
so--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
l.
rose
she
had
friends
who
had
filed
charges
before.
she
had
met
with
them.
much
of
this
i
can--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--they
had
all
filled
out
intake
questionnaires.
many
of
them
had
filed
charges
thereafter.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
i
mean,
there's
a
whole...
she
is
from
the
same
station...
she
was
from
the
same
station
as
mr.
freeman,
who
filed
a
suit
way
back
in
1999
with
a
group
of
other
people.
so
this
language
was
around,
and
the
couriers
were
friends,
some
of
them
at
least,
and
they
discussed
the
matter
with
each
other.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
because
i
spoke
to
her
in
january,
and
i
believe
it
was...
this
is
not
on
the
record,
but
it's
compatible
with
my
allegations
in
the
complaint.
this
is
not
on
the
record,
but
she...
i...
i
never
had
seen
her
in
person,
and
i
spoke
to
her,
and
she
said
she
had
been
to
eeoc,
and
she
filed
it.
and
then
i
called
her
in
january
and
said...
late
january,
i
think...
did
eeoc
give
you
a
number?
i
didn't
know
the
difference
then
between
a
complaint...
between
a
form
5
and
a
form
283.
it
was
not
something...
i
had
been
practicing
mostly
title
vii
work,
but
i
had
had
some
age
cases
before
then.
and
i
didn't
know
the
difference
in
the
forms.
and
i
had
a
form
on
my
computer
that
i
had
people
fill
out
which
says
"charge",
but...
so
she...
i
said
they
must
have
lost
it.
why
don't
you
go
down
and...
she
said,
well,
i'll
file
it
again.
i
said
fine.
mr.
david
l.
rose
by
february,
i...
i
don't
think
we
had
the
retainer,
but
i
had
talked
to
her,
and
i...
and
she
signed
the
retainer
either
in
late
january
or
early
february.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
because
it
hadn't
been
docketed.
it's
like
a
clerk.
they...
you...
it's
similar
to
what
the
courts...
the
courts
do.
they
get
a
new
thing,
and
they
docket
it.
the
problem
with
eeoc
is,
when
they
get
a
new
thing
that's
not
a
form
5,
they
don't
docket
it.
this
didn't
get
docketed.
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
don't
know
when
they
docketed
the
form,
the
form
5,
that
she
filed.
but
the
timing
suggests
they
did
not
docket
it
until
august,
sometime
after
august.
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
exactly.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
she
probably
didn't,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
david
l.
rose
sure.
mr.
david
l.
rose
right.
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh,
it's--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--i
think
the
law
says
that
it
could
be
a
defense
but
it's
an
affirmative
defense
and
it's
not--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--right.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i'd
say
the
law
is,
your
honor,
what
the
regulation
says.
the
regulation
was
adopted
in
1983
after
notice
published
in
the
1981
regulation
says
that
any
document
that
has,
identifies
the
employer,
essentially
respondent,
and
identifies
the
nature,
general
nature
of
the
charge
and
is
signed
is
a
document.
by
the
way?
mr.
david
l.
rose
it's
in
all
the,
it's
in
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
it's
toward
the
end
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
david
l.
rose
that
sounds
right.
yes.
it's
351
if
you
look
on
the
351,
three,
it
says
in
the
middle
there,
in
the
middle
of
that
dense
paragraph,
it
says
that
most
clearly
in
six
which
is
on
351.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
oh,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
let
me...
let
me
refer
you
to
the
next
page,
then,
your
honor,
which
is--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--which
is
(a)
and
(b).
"notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
(a)
of
8
above
of
this
section,
a
charge
is
sufficient
when
the
commission
receives
from
the
person
making
the
charge
either
a
written
statement
or
information
reduced
to
writing
by
the
commission
that
conforms
to
the
requirements
of
1626.
"
which
i
just
read
on
page
351.
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
like
that
one,
too,
your
honor.
[laughter]
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
think
that
it...
it
really
depends
whether
the
employee
has
put
on
top
of
it...
i
think
you
need...
i
think
there
is
a...
we
take
the
position
that
if
it
meets
the
definition
of
1626.3,
or
the
other
parts
of
1626,
it
is
a
charge.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
think--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--i
think
the
last
question
was
whether
if...
if
she
checked
the
other
box,
it
would
be;
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
consistency
on
what
eeoc
has
done
in
that
situation.
mr.
david
l.
rose
right.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
think
that's
why
the
better
reading
probably,
as
your
honor
suggests,
is
that
it's
not
a
charge
if
that's
all
the
form
is,
and
she
checks
only--
mr.
david
l.
rose
--absolutely.
