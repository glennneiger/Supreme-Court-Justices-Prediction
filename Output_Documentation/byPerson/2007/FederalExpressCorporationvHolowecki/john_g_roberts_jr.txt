chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-1322,
federal
express
corporation
v.
holowecki.
ms.
lensing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think...
i
think
you're
right
about
that.
i
mean,
once
the
lawyer's
involved
and
they're
in
litigation
and
all
that,
they're
not
going
to
take
conciliation
efforts
with
the
same
light
as
before.
but
the
question
is
whether
the
remedy
for
that,
which
is
some
unfairness
to
you,
is
to
throw
the
suit
out
or
try
to
fix
it
as
much
as
possible,
such
as
through
a
stay
or
dismissing
without
prejudice
or
something.
why
should
the
plaintiff...
it's
not
his
fault
that
the
eeoc
didn't
notify
you.
why
should
he
suffer
the
categorical
sanction
of
dismissal
simply
because
it's
a
little
unfairness
to
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
know...
perhaps
this
is
a
question
your
friend
on
the
other
side
will
be
able
to
answer
better
than
you.
but
do
we
know
where
she
got
the
form,
why
she
filled
it
out?
i
couldn't
find
in
the
record
whether
this
was
given
to
her
by
someone
at
the
eeoc
or
whether
she
downloaded
it
from
the
website
or
what.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
agree
completely
with
everything
you
said.
i
just
don't
understand
your
leap
from
government
incompetence
to
saying
the
plaintiff
loses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
ms.
kennedy
is
entitled
to
equitable
tolling
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
she,
reasonably
or
otherwise,
thought
there
already
was
a
lawsuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
you
undertake
conciliation
efforts
after
her
formal,
her
filing
of
the
form
5
charge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
government
relied
in
its
brief
very
heavily
on
the
chevron
case,
saying
we
should
defer
to
the
agency's
regulations,
and
on
the
auer
case,
saying
we
defer
to
the
agency
to
tell
us
what
its
regulations
mean.
and
you
didn't
cite
either
of
those
cases
in
your
reply
brief.
so
i
wonder
what
your
answer
is
to
that
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you're
only...
when
you
say
you're
hurt,
the
only
prejudice
that
you
rely
on
is
the
fact
that
you
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
go
through
prelitigation
conciliation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but...
but
my
point
is,
you're
not
alleging
prejudice
from
the
lack
of
prompt
notice.
in
other
words,
it's
not
a
situation
where
you'd
say
if
we
had
notice
we
would
have
done
this,
and
that
would
have
prevented
everything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
only
prejudice
is
the
lack
of
conciliation
period.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
lensing.
mr.
rose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
rose,
i'm
having
trouble
figuring
out...
she
not
only
filed
this
intake
questionnaire;
she
also
filed
a
lengthy
affidavit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
did
all
this
stuff
come
from?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
these
friends
file
charges
on
intake
questionnaires?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
form
5.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
know
why
she
signed
the
intake
questionnaire
on
two
different
dates?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
were
representing
her
at
that
point?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
351?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
like
my
cite
better.
if
you
look
at
1626.3
on
page
351,
it
says:
""charge"
shall
mean
a
statement
filed
with
the
commission
by,
or
on
behalf
of,
an
aggrieved
person
which
alleges
that
the
main
prospective
defendant
has
engaged
in,
or
is
about
to
engage
in,
actions
in
violation--
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
rose.
mr.
heytens.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
should
we
defer
to
an
agency
regulation
when
people
in
the
agency
hardly
ever
follow
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
didn't...
in
this
case
you
didn't
treat
it
as
a
charge,
because
you
didn't
give
notice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
give
chevron
deference
to
things
like
your
internal
compliance
manual
and
these
other
memos?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
heytens.
miss
lensing,
you
have
a
minute
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
miss
lensing.
the
case
is
submitted.
