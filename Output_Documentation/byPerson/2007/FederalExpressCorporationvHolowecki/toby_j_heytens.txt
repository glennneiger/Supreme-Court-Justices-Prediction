mr.
toby
j.
heytens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--the
agency
absolutely
agrees
with
that,
your
honor,
and
the
agency
has
taken
a
number
of
concrete
steps,
some
of
which
we
illustrate
in
our
brief,
to
deal
with
what
in
reality
is
a
very
serious
problem.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out,
therefore,
right
at
the
start,
that
the
problems
that
arose
in
this
case
are
in
some
measure...
not
exclusively
but
in
some
measure...
a
reflection
of
when
it
arose.
ms.
kennedy
submitted
her
form
in
december
of
2001.
that
was
before
the
edelman
litigation;
and,
most
importantly,
it
was
before
the
february
21st,
2002,
memo
that
was
issued
in
response
to
the
edelman
litigation.
now,
some
members
of
the
court
may
recall
that
one
of
the
problems
that
surfaced
at
the
time
of
edelman
was
that
the
agency,
or
at
least
some
of
the
field
offices
of
the
agency,
had
a
practice
of
not
serving
notice
until
after
they
received
a
verified
form
5.
and
the
february
21st
memo
was
to
say
that
needs
to
stop
right
now
because
our
statutory
obligations
require
us
to
serve
notice
within
10
days
of
the
charge.
so
that
happened
immediately
following
the
edelman
litigation,
which
was,
regrettably,
after
this
case
arose.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
sure.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that's
correct.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
that's
correct,
as
well,
justice
scalia,
and
it's
important
that--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--two
responses
to
that,
justice
scalia:
first
of
all
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that,
from
our
perspective,
the
test
is
an
objective
intent
test
that
looks
to
the
intent
of
the
employee,
not
the
intent
of
the
eeoc
in
promulgating
a
form.
and
the
reason
that's
important--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--the
fundamental
source
of
the
problem,
justice
scalia,
is,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
vast
majority
of
people
who
initiate
eeoc
proceedings
are
lay
people
who
aren't
familiar
with
the
statute.
and
the
other
dilemma
is
that
a
great
many
of
the
initial
contacts
with
the
eeoc...
the
eeoc,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
got
176,000
initial
contacts
in
fiscal
year
2006.
of
those,
32,000
of
them
came
in
by
mail...
mail
from
lay
people
who
have
no--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--certainly,
justice
breyer.
the
definition
of
"charge"
is
the
one
the
chief
justice
cited.
it
is
in
1626.3
of
the
regulations,
and
that's--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--the
word
"manifest
intent"
is
not
set
forth
expressly
there.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
just
as
a
point
of
clarification,
justice
breyer,
the
three
requirements
that
i
believe
you
just
referred
to
are
in
1626.6,
which
is
the
provision
of
the
regulations
labeled
"form
of
charges".
we
are
saying
that
it's
in
construction
of
1626.3,
the
definition
of
"charge".
now,
i
concede
that
the--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--sure.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
four
places,
justice
breyer:
first
of
all,
you
could
go
to
the
final
rule
as
it
was
promulgated
in
1983.
there
was
an
issue
that
came
up
when
the
agency
promulgated
the
final
rule
that
the
definition
of
1626.3,
was
ambiguous
and
unclear.
and
in
the
final
rule
at
volume
48
of
the
federal
register,
page
138,
the
eeoc
stated
that
one
of
the
distinctions
between
a
charge
and
a
complaint
is
that
a
complaint
is
a
way
for
the
eeoc
to
receive
information
about
allegations
of
discrimination
where
"the
party
providing
the
information
does
not
wish
to
file
a
charge.
"
that
was
in
the
final--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--in
our
view,
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
complaint
would
include,
in
a
typical
case,
an
intake
questionnaire,
but
a
complaint
is
broader.
a
complaint
refers
under
the
regulations
to
any
way
that
the
eeoc
receives
information
about
discrimination.
the
reason
that's
contained
in
the
age
act
regulations
is
because,
unlike
title
vii,
the
eeoc
doesn't
need
a
formal
charge
in
order
to
initiate
its
own
proceedings.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it's
not
fair
to
say
that
people
in
the
agency
very
rarely
follow
it.
we
would
agree
that
in
certain--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--it's
true
that
in
this
case
the
document
was
not
docketed
as
a
charge,
and
that's
true;
we
know
that.
the
problem
is,
because
it
arose
before
edelman
and
because
it
arose
before
the
february
21st,
2002,
memo,
we
simply
don't
know
why
it
wasn't
treated
as
a
charge.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
yes.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
48
federal
register
138,
justice
breyer.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
it
is
not
codified
in
the
cfr.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
the
second
place
it
is
in
section
2.2
(b)
of
the
compliance
manual.
that
language
has
been
contained
since
at
least
1988,
if
not
sooner,
and
it's
quoted
on
page
16
of
our
brief.
the
third
place
you
would
look
is
the
february
21st,
2002
memo
which
is
on
the
eeoc's
web
site.
and
it's
also
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
which
directs
use
of
the
compliance
manual;
and
it's
also
the
august
13th,
2007
memo,
which
is
also
attached
to
our
brief,
and
what
is
also
contained
on
the
agency's
web
site.
so
this
is
not
something--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
certainly
do
not
assert,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
compliance
manual
gets
chevron
deference.
in
our
view,
the
compliance
manual
represents
the
agency's
considered
judgment
about
the
proper
interpretation
of
its
regulations,
and
is
thus
entitled
to
deference
under
auer.
the
petitioners
don't
allege
that
our
regulations
don't
get
chevron
deference.
the
eeoc
has
clearly
been
given
the
authority
to
issue
regulations
dealing
with
this
topic.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
in
situations
where
the
form
5
is
filled
out
in
the
office,
justice
ginsburg,
yes,
that's
correct.
sometimes
people
mail
in
modified
form
5,
but
official
issues
where
it's
done
during
the
office
visit,
my
understanding
is
that
the
typical
practice
it's
filled
out
by
the
eeoc
office.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
in
situations
where
the
employer
does
not
receive
notice,
justice
scalia?
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
the
first
thing
we
think...
at
that
point,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
task
is
to
try
to
recreate
as
well
as
possible
the
situation
that
should
have
existed,
and
the
commission
agrees
notice
should
have
been
given.
so
the
first
thing,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
the
employer
should
be
entitled
to
a
stay
of
the
litigation
for
up
to
60
days
to
attempt
to
intent
to
work
out,
absent
discovery
requests,
absent
motions
practices...
the
problem...
justice
scalia,
you
raised
the
problem
that
at
that
point,
the
person
probably
has
a
lawyer
and
you
can't
talk
to
him,
but
there's
really...
but
i
think
that's
conceptually
a
separate
question,
for
two
reasons.
first,
they
might
have
had
a
lawyer
when
they
filed
the
charge,
in
which
case
the
same
problem
you
discussed
would
arise;
but
the
flip
side
is
it
they
could
also
be
pro
se
after
they
filed
a
lawsuit,
in
which
case
the
ex
parte
bar
wouldn't
count
either.
so
i
think
it's
conceptually,
although
i
can
see
it's
probably
related
in
practice,
it's
at
least
conceptually
different.
the
second
thing
we
think,
and
it's
been
explored
during
the
oral
arguments
so
far,
if
the
employer
could
allege
or
show
some
concrete
prejudice
as
a
result
of
not
having
received
notice,
then
the
district
court
should
take
that
into
account.
but
in
this
case
federal
express
has
simply
not
alleged
any
concrete
prejudice.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
the
precise
words
manifest?
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
then--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
but
i
would
say,
justice
breyer,
the
word
intend
is
in
fact
in
the
1983
final
rule;
it
says
where
the
person
"does
not
intend
to
file"...
i
apologize,
justice
breyer.
as
i
stand
here,
the
word
is
"wish",
"does
not
wish
to
file
a
charge.
"
the
language
in
the
compliance
manual
which
is
repeated
in
the
memorandum
is
well,
is
it
states
that
you
look
at
whether
the
submission
constitutes
a
clear
request
for
the
agency
to
act,
which
we
think,
though
not
exactly
the
words
manifest--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
ask...
in
our
view
that
if
she
had
checked
the
box
saying
do
not
disclose
for
identity,
this
would
not
have
been
a
charge.
thank
you.
