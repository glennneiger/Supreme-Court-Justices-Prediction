justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
they
do
that
why
can't...
and
you
don't...
if
they
don't
give
you
the
notice,
well,
then
you
can
complain,
they
didn't
give
us
the
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
you're
not
hurt
by
it,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
don't
get
it,
you
can't
complain,
if
you
actually
knew
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
didn't
know
about
it,
then...
then
you
have
a
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
well,
then
you'd
have
the
complaint
if
you
didn't,
et
cetera,
but
so
what?
in
other
words,
if
the
eeoc
wants
to
have
a
very
broad
definition
that
turns
90
percent
of
its...
whatever
this
thing
is
called,
the
statement...
i
forgotten
the
name,
sorry.
what's
the
name
of
this
document?
the
intake
questionnaire.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
if
it
has
a
broad
definition
that
says
this
counts
as
a
charge,
so
what?
let
it
do
it.
who's
hurt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they
don't,
you
complain
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
complain
just
as
you're
doing
now,
in
court.
you
just
the
same
words,
but
instead
of
using
the
words
as
against
the
word
"charge",
you
use
those
same
words
you've
all
said
in
your
excellent
arguments,
except
you
attack
the
fact
you
didn't
get
the
notice,
and
there
you're
really
hurt.
or
if
you're
not,
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
so
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
they
made
a
mistake
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
think
miss
lensing,
one
of
her
more
basic
points
is
this:
there
is
a
statute.
and
the
statute
says
the
eeoc
shall
send
prompt
notice
in
part
to
the
conciliation.
and
she
adds,
if
we
get
the
notice,
we
also
start
getting
evidence
and
preserving
it
and
talking
to
people.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
they
would
like
to
do
with
that
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
replied
to
that,
well,
okay,
they
complain
about
the
lack
of
notice.
but
her
response
is,
sure,
they
sometimes
don't
give
notice
when
they
file
a
charge.
that's
just
a
mistake.
but
if
you
start
calling
these
documents
charges,
well,
they
never
give
notice,
so
they
will
never
do
it.
it
will
be
a
big
problem,
so,
therefore,
don't
call
them
charges.
now,
i
want
to
know
what
your
answer
is
to
the
first
part
of
what
i
said.
my...
i
was
assuming
that
if
the
employer
is
really
hurt,
there
is
a
statute
and
a
rule
and
the
statute
and
the
rules
say
you
have
to
give
notice
and
if
they
are
hurt
by
that,
they
can
complain
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
must
make
mistakes
in
their
history
when
they
file
charges
and
didn't
give
notice.
so
what
does
the
law
tell
us?
if
you
found
it
any
case
ever
where
the
eeoc
didn't
give
the
notice,
now
the
complainant
files
a
lawsuit
and
it's
not
the
complainant's
fault,
her
response
is
work
out
some
kind
of
equitable
tolling.
but
there
must
be
law
on
this,
because
this
couldn't...
this
is
a
big
agency
and
they
must
have
sometimes
in
the
past
forgotten
to
give
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
the
law
say
happens
when
they
don't
give
notice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
defense.
i
mean,
it's
not
this
complainant's
fault.
it's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you'd
have
to
work
out
some
kind
of
equitable
tolling
or
something.
i
think
she's
right
about
that.
there
is
no
law
to
your
knowledge
or
what
is
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
practical
problem:
i
want
to
know
where
do
i
read
what
the
definition
of
a
eeoc
rules.
the
three
criteria
that
it
has
certain
information
in
it
can't
be
the
rule.
it
can't
be
the
rule
because
we
already
know
that
it
isn't
a
charge
if
the
person
says
i
don't
want
it
to
become
public.
so,
where
do
i
read
the
rule
that
you
just
said?
that
it...
an
intake
questionnaire
that
satisfies
these
three
conditions
becomes
a
charge
if
it
reflects
the
manifest
intent
of
the
person
who
files
it
that
it
be
a
charge.
you
said
that.
that's
a
pretty
modestly
clear
rule,
except
it
isn't
totally.
and
they
qualify...
where
do
i
read
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
use
the
word
there
"manifest
intent"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
well,
i
read
those
regs,
and
those
regs
had
a
definition
that
can't
possibly
be
right
as
applied
to
"intake
questionnaire",
because
they
make
it
a
charge
when
the
person
says
i
don't
want
notice.
so
we
know
that
isn't
the
thing.
i
also
know
what
you
just
said
does
sound
like
a
rule.
i
just
want
to
know
where
to
read
it,
because
i
don't
think
you'd
refer
to
a
rule
of
an
agency,
though
normally
we
do...
but
you
don't
refer
to
a
rule
that
doesn't
exist;
you
don't
refer
to
a
rule
that
nowhere
can
be
found;
you
don't
refer
to
a
rule
that
is
internally
inconsistent.
so,
before
i
defer,
i
would
just
like
to
know
where
the
clear
rule
that
you
stated
can
be
found.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
just
want
to
read
it
somewhere.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
if
i
were
not
here
having
you
in
front
of
me,
as
many
people
don't
have
you
in
front
of
them,
where
i
would
go
to
read
just
what
you
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
said
there
were
going
to
be
four
places.
i
want
to
write
them
down.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
is
48
fed.
reg.
148?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
138.
now,
the
other
three.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
on
the
notice
point.
going
back
to
the
other,
more
important
point,
your
words
that
i
found
quite
useful
are
the
"manifest
intent",
that
shows
a
manifest...
are
those
words
going
to
be
in
these
four
sources
that
i
look
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
suspect
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
therefore...
i'm--
