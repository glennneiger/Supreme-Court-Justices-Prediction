justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
don't
we
do
exactly
that
here?
i
mean,
you
say
that
the
proper
thing
to
do,
now
a
charge
labelled
form
5
has
been
filed,
is
to
dismiss
this
lawsuit;
and
then
we
wait
60
days;
and
the
identical
lawsuit
is
reinstated.
why
shouldn't
the
court
simply
toll
the
case
and
say,
now
we
have
a
proper
form
5.
the
employer
didn't
get
a
chance
to
engage
in
settlement.
so
we
hold
on
to
the
case
and
allow
the
60
days
to
elapse,
and
then
the
complaint
is
there.
why
isn't
that
the
appropriate
solution
for
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
the
same
complaint
could
be
filed
at
the
end
of
the
conciliation.
what
difference
does
it
make
that
you
have
a
piece
of
paper
there?
what
i
don't
understand
is
the
only
effect
of
your
position...
dismiss
the
whole
thing,
60
days,
start
over...
is
you're
making
the
plaintiff
file
an
additional
filing
fee.
the
complaint
has
already
been
filed.
the
filing
fee
has
been
paid.
now,
everything
would
work
out
just
the
same
except
the
plaintiff
has
to
pay
a
second
filing
fee.
in
the
court
there
are
certain
inefficiencies
if
it's
first
dismissed
and
then
they
have
to
docket
it
again.
so
i
don't
see
any...
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
sense
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
after
she
had
a
lawyer.
but
is
it...
is
it
not
the
practice
at
the
eeoc
when
you're
dealing
with
an
unrepresented
person
who
files
the
intake
questionnaire
and
if
the
sec
reviewer
thinks
that
it
fits
within
the
statute,
that
the
form
5
will
be
filled
out,
not
by
the
layperson,
but
by
the
eeoc
officer
herself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
the
question.
the
question
i
asked
is
if
they
decide
that
the,
what
the
intake...
the
information
on
the
intake
questionnaire
fits
within
the
statute
so
that
the
claim
can
go
forward,
isn't
it
the
practice
not
to
ask
the
layperson
to
fill
out
the
form
5,
but
for
the
eeoc
to
do
it
itself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
has
to
be
signed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
she
filled
out
hers
after
she
was
already
in
court
and
had
a
lawyer.
but
i
thought
that
this
statute,
as
all
the
statutes
eeoc
administers,
are
designed
for
claims
that
are
put
forth
initially
largely
by
unrepresented
people.
and
the
notion
is
that
the
agency
should
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
for
them
to
get
through
the
legal
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happens...
what
happens
if...
in
this
case
it's
not
a
problem,
but
i
can
imagine
it
would
be
in
many
cases...
if
you
have
a
300-day
or
a
180-day
problem,
you
withdraw
the
complaint,
and
then
you're
out
there
and
the
clock
keeps
ticking,
and
you
get
past
the
300
days
and
you
are
totally
out.
that's
why
it's
important
not
to
follow...
to
say,
well,
it's,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
if
we
dismiss
this
complaint,
she
comes
back
in
60
days.
well,
but
60
days
may
be
360
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
she
appealing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
she
appealing
the
dismissal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
understand
that,
because
eeoc
is
a
responsible
agency.
congress
has
told
it:
you
weed
out
the
people
complaining
about
something
that
happened
in
paris,
and
then
you
give
notice.
but
the
notice
obligation...
and
i
understand
it
is
eeoc's,
not
the
complainant's.
so
we
would
not
expect
this
agency...
yes,
it
messed
up
in
this
case...
routinely
not
to
give
notice,
routinely
not
to
engage
the
employer
in
conciliation
efforts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
new
form,
the
eeoc's
new
form...
i
suppose
responsive
to
this
case
and
others
like
it...
that
says
if
you
don't
file
any
other
administrative
complaint,
we'll
count
the
intake
questionnaire
as
the
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
eeoc
treats
it
as
a
charge,
then
the
eeoc
is
obliged
to
give
notice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where...
where
does
it
say
if
you
don't
file
it's
only--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
new
form.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
where
in
the
form
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
new
form
does
say
that,
that
if
no
other
paper
is
filed,
this
can
be
treated
as
a
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
whether
that's
true
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
whether...
i
mean
the
difference...
what
you
are
suggesting
would
be
perfectly
fine
is
once
the
charge
was
filed,
and
this
is
a
lawsuit,
and
then
you
would
investigate
or
whatever,
but
you
would
be
under
exactly
the
same
disadvantage
if
the
time
lapse
has
meant
that
employees
have
left,
that
you
have...
you
have
removed
evidence
as
old
and
disposable.
it
wouldn't...
you
would...
on
your
scenario
of
what
would
be
the
right
way
to
do
this
lawsuit,
you
would
be...
you
would
suffer
the
same
disabilities
in
terms
of
documents
and
witnesses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
she
had
the
obligation
to
give
notice,
you
would
have
a
much
stronger
argument,
but
the
statute
places
that
burden
on
the
eeoc,
not
on
the
lay
complainant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
where...
you're
reading
from
where?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
a
complaint
different
from
an
intake
questionnaire?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
heytens,
is
it
true
that
the
form
5
for
somebody
who's
not
represented
by
counsel
is
usually
done
by
eeoc
itself?
is
it
that
true?
