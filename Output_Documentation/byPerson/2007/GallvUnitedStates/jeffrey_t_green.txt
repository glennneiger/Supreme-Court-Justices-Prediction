mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
judge
robert
w.
pratt
of
the
southern
district
of
iowa
sentenced
brian
michael
gall
on
may
27,
2005,
he
found
mr.
gall
to
be
an
individual
who
had
fully
rehabilitated
himself
by
having
voluntarily
withdrawn
from
a
conspiracy
five
years
earlier,
by
remaining
crime-free
throughout
that
period,
by
having
rid
himself
of
his
addictions,
by
having
graduated
from
college,
by
having
learned
a
trade,
by
having
built
a
successful
and
thriving
business.
judge
pratt
carefully
weighed
the
section
3553(a)
factors
and
in
a
ten-page
sentencing
memorandum
set
forth
cogent
reasons
why
a
sentence
of
probation
would
better
fit
the
purposes
and
factors
specified
in
section
3553(a)
than
a
sentence
of
incarceration.
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
extraordinary
circumstances
test
that
we
would
ask
the
court
to
overturn
today.
the
eighth
circuit
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
judge
pratt,
saying
that
judge
pratt
had
placed
too
much
weight
on
mr.
gall's
voluntary
withdrawal
from
the
conspiracy
and
in
so
doing
had
not
satisfied
or
overcome
the
extraordinariness
barrier.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
certainly,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
probably
be
arguing
something
of
the
reverse.
[laughter]
it
is...
it
is
an
abuse
of
discretion--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--yes,
that's
certainly
true,
but
in
this
instance
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
applies.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no.
i
wouldn't
say...
well,
let
me...
the
district
court
was
certainly
not
irrational
in
our
view.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
it
would
have
to
be.
i
hesitated
because
there...
there
might
be
instances
in
which,
as
indeed
the
government
admits
in
its
brief,
that
the
reasons
and
the
facts
and
circumstances
don't
logically
cohere
with
the
sentence
that's
given.
in
other
words,
if
all
of
the
circumstances
and
facts
point
a
certain
way...
in
this
instance,
for
example,
they
point
to
a
downward
departure...
and
suddenly
the
judge
goes
up
to
the
statutory
max,
that
might
be
an
instance
in
which
a
court
of
appeals
could
say
no
reasonable
judge
would
have
imposed
that
sentence.
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
reason
for
doing
so.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
justice
ginsburg,
when
someone
leaves
the
conspiracy
and
blows
the
whistle,
typically,
that
individual
is
not
charged.
the
department
of
justice,
for
example,
in
its
antitrust
division
says
that
if
a
corporation
or
individual
comes
to
it
and
blows
the
whistle
on,
say,
a
price-fixing
conspiracy,
that
individual
is
never
charged
to
begin
with.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
that's
true,
your
honor.
there
are
instances
in
which--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--yes,
but
the
point
is
that
blowing
the
whistle
is...
is
not
only
a
voluntary
withdrawal,
but
also
something
so
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
what
prosecutors
typically
see
that
that
individual,
typically
or
generally
is
the
individual
that
receives
immunity
or
amnesty
in
the
case.
to
respond
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
money
that
mr.
gall
made,
he
did
not
use
it,
and
there's
no
information
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
he
built
his
business
on
the
basis
of
the
use
of
that
money.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no,
there
was
not,
and
in
part
because,
as
the
sealed
volume
of
the
appendix
demonstrates,
mr.
gall
did
not
at
that
point
have
money
to
pay
a
fine.
remember
that
he
was...
he
left
the
conspiracy
in
september
of
2000.
he
was
not
approached
by
agents
until
late
2003.
he
was
not
charged
until
2004
and
was
not
sentenced
until
2005.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i...
i--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--yeah,
well,
i'm
happy
to
swallow
in
that
sense.
[laughter]
there's
no
doubt
about
the
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--there
is...
there
isn't
much
left
besides
the
fact
that
it
is
abuse
of
discretion
review.
that
there
is
no
robust
substantive
component
to...
to
reasonableness
review
of
sentences,
is
really
a
complaint
about
abuse
of
discretion
review.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
not
necessarily.
i
think
if...
if
a
judge--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--not
necessarily
for
consideration
of
age,
but
a
court
of
appeals
could
say
to...
to
such
a
judge...
and
i
am
sure
that
one
of
the
parties
would
point
this
out,
would
say
you
considered
it
last
time;
you
didn't
consider
it.
you've
been
seesawing
back
and
forth
on
this.
the
court
of
appeals
could
say--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--explain
why--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--yes,
both...
both
would
be
upheld.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
if
somebody
said--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
well,
it
does
require
a
broader
view,
and
certainly
a
judge
could--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--there
would
be.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
and
i
was
about
to
add--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--i
would...
i
would
imagine
a
judge
would
want
to
look
at...
at
cases
from
the
whole
country.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
certainly
they
have--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--it
did
in
establishing
the
guidelines.
there
are
disputes
about
whether
the
commissioners
actually
modified
the
guidelines
on
the
basis
of
what
judges
have
actually
done.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
exactly.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
that's...
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
so
there
is
a
component
to
this
in
which
a
judge
might
want
to
look
through
legal
database,
for
example,
or
even
a
blog
or
something
like
that,
and
look
and
see--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
certainly.
and
one
of
our
responses,
justice
kennedy,
to
the
issue
of
there
not
being
a
robust
component
of
substantiveness...
or...
excuse
me...
of
substantive
review
of
sentences
if
that
congress
can
fix
that.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
if
the
unwarranted--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--a
court
of
appeals
could,
yes,
i
think
it
could
that.
they
could
ask
an
explanation.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i
think
that's
correct.
a
common
law--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--that's...
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
yes.
yes,
and
that
is...
that
is
one
danger
of
the
extraordinary
circumstances
test.
in
fact,
there's
two
dangers
in
that--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--i
believe
that
congress
could
pass
such
a
statute,
yes.
but...
but...
i
hesitate
to
add
that,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
constitutional
grounding
for
individualized
sentencing
and
age
is
a
key
factor
with
respect
to
individualized
sentencing,
i...
i
want
to
hesitate
and
i
want
to
waver.
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--well,
in
response
to
that
question
and
your
earlier
question,
justice
ginsburg,
certainly
congress
could,
to
fix
the
entire
problem
here,
could
adopt
the
solution
that
we
proposed
in
booker
and
in
fanfan
that
to
say
that...
that
in
order
to
enhance
a
sentence
at
all,
that
has...
it
has
to
be
a
fact
found
by
the
jury,
what's
so-called
blakelyizing
of
the
guidelines.
that's
one
way
to
do
it.
congress
could
also,
as
has
been
suggested
and
i
believe
legislation
has
been
introduced
on
this,
they
could
make
the
guidelines
essentially
topless,
so
that
there...
so
that
there
was
complete--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--no,
i
don't
think
that
it
could.
any
time
congress--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--well,
it
could
delegate
the
authority.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
and
this
court
has
said
it's
all
right
for
congress
to
delegate
the
authority
to
the
commission.
but
the
problem,
justice
alito,
comes
whenever
we
limit
the
statutory
continuum
from
zero
to
the
statutory
maximum
sentence,
if
we
overlay
a
consideration.
if
on
the
extraordinary
circumstances
test
we
make
the
guidelines
the
benchmark
and
we
tether
or
we
measure
from
the
guidelines,
we
have
then
set
a
kind
of
statutory
range.
if
congress
says
to
a
commission,
we
want
you
to
develop
a
kind
of
mini-guideline
based
upon
age,
we
think
that
there
might
be
departure
in
some
circumstances
but
not
other
circumstances,
that
might
be
an
instance
where
we
are
setting
a
kind
of
ceiling
and
a
floor
and
a
range
within
the
otherwise
broader
statutory
continuum.
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
in
that
instance,
though,
we
run
into
the
problem
that
justice
scalia
identified
and
that
problem
is
we
start
to
get
limitations
based
upon
certain
factors,
and
the
courts
of
appeals--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--to
see
whether...
the
point
is
to
see
whether
or
not
the
reasons
that
are
offered
in
those
cases
turn
out
to
be
valid,
cogent--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--certainly
the
court
should
look
at
the
reasons
and
should
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
reasons
are
rationally
grounded
in
section
3553(a).
but
our
position
is
once
they
are,
that's...
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
that...
that's
correct,
and
that's
essentially
the
kind
of
system
that
we've
got
now.
this
is
not
a
fulsome
abuse
of
discretion
review
throughout
the
range
of
sentencing.
what
we
have
now
is
a...
on
this
extraordinary
circumstances
test
is
a...
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
substitution
of
judgment.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
30
to
37
months,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
examples
out
there.
one,
this
case
poynter
out
of,
out
of
the
sixth
circuit,
where
the
judge
went
all
the
way
up
to
the
absolute
statutory
max
in
a
child
pornography...
or
rather,
a
child
molestation
case,
on
the
ground
that,
first,
the
statutory
max
will
take
care
of
any
unwarranted
disparity.
that's
not...
that's
not
really
a
cogent
reason
and
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
we
have
another
case
out
of
the...
recently
out
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
valdes,
in
which...
in
which
the
court
departed
upwards
on
the
ground
of
the
fact
that
the
check
that
had
been
written
that...
the
fraudulent
check
that
had
been
written,
had
been
written
to
the
district
court.
and
so
the
court
was
angry
that
its
own
court
had
been...
or
the
neighboring
court
had
been
duped.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i
do
think
that's
unreasonable,
your
honor.
i'll
go
that
far.
i'll
admit
that
much.
certainly
that's
not
like
the
famous
yankees
and
red
sox
example.
that's
not
rationally
grounded
in
section
3553(a)
factors.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no,
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
pointed
at
the
end
of
our
merits
brief,
page
35
and
36,
we
point
to
other
cases
where
courts
have
given
lenient
sentences
because
of
a
voluntary
rehabilitative
effort
by
the
defendant.
and
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
in
no
way...
or
indicated
in
no
way
did
judge
pratt
rely
on
improper
factors
in
deciding
the
sentence.
it
had
a
complaint
about
his
reliance
on
age,
but
really
that
was
a--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i
would
find
such
an
absolute
policy
disagreement
difficult
as
well,
justice
breyer.
and
the
reason
why
it's
difficult
is
because
it
is
not
sentencing
in
accordance
with
section
3553(a).
section
3553(a)
requires
consideration
of
the
individual
characteristics
of
the
defendant
and
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime.
in
koon,
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--exactly.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
the
words
should
be
these
with
respect
to
policy
judgments:
the
district
court
may
consider
policy
disagreements
with
the
sentencing
guidelines
or
may
disagree
with
the
policies
stated
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
or
underlying
those
guidelines,
as
long
as
that
disagreement
is
rationally
or
reasonably
grounded
in
the
facts
of
the
case,
that
it
fits
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
and
in
so
doing--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--yes
and
no.
the
yes
part
is--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--okay.
the
yes...
the
yes
part
is
that...
that
it
is
in
accordance
with
the...
the
majority
opinion
in
rita
and
other
cases,
there
is
an
invitation
to
district
courts
to
reconsider
if
they
find...
if
they
so
find
it
necessary,
the
facts...
or
rather,
excuse
me,
the
policies
as
articulated
in
the
sentencing
guidelines.
they
are
free
to
do
that.
but
under
section
3553(a),
justice
scalia,
that
has
to
be
rationally
grounded
in
the
case
before
them.
this--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
relevance
and
rational--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--if
the
district
court
applied
that
as
a
policy
across
all
cases
that
come
before
it
involving
crack
or
powder
cocaine,
justice
scalia,
that
is
an
abdication
of
the
district
court's
duty
under
section
3553(a).
and
under
this
court's
opinion--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--no,
no,
i'm
not,
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
yes,
it
has
to...
it
does
not
have
to
follow
the
guidelines
and
it
can
disagree,
but
it
has
to
tie
that
disagreement
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
no,
because
i
don't
think
a
district
judge
would
have
to
find
that
the
case
was
somehow
an
outlier.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
well,
the
facts
of
a
case
where
there's
a
disagreement
with
a
policy
might
be,
for
example,
the
policy
might
be...
let's
take
embezzlement
because
i
don't
want
to
tread
on
my
colleague's
argument.
let's
take
embezzlement--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--age
is
a
good
example.
justice...
or,
excuse
me...
judge
pratt
in
his
sentencing
memorandum,
said...
cited
studies
that
show
that
young
people's
risk
inhibition
behavior
is
not
quite
as
well
developed
as
people
later
on,
and
that
recidivism
drops
remarkably
as
you
move
forward
into
your
20s.
now,
he
did
not
rely
on
that
argument
in
order
to
impose
the
sentence
he
did.
he
used
that
as
a
contrast
to
say
this
where
is
brian
gall
was
when
he
was
a
member
of
this
conspiracy
and
look
at
where
he
has
gotten
to,
having
fully
rehabilitated
himself.
so
that
is
a
means
by
which
a
judge
can
say,
you
know,
the
policy
of
the
guidelines
may
be
that
age
should
be
a
discouraged
factor,
but
it
could
be
relevant
in
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
but
not
necessarily,
because
a
district
judge
who
is
looking
the
defendant
in
the
eye,
and
is
the
best
placed
judicial
actor
to
make
that
decision,
may
say
i
see
a
21-year-old
in
front
of
me
who
is
uniquely
mature.
that
is
a...
that
is
a
quintessential
multifarious,
pleading,
narrow,
shifting
fact;
the
district
judge
may
make
the
decision.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
well,
he...
he
may
have
rejected
it...
if...
i
wouldn't
even...
dare
say
that
in
a
multiplicity
of
cases.
he
may
have
rejected
it
in
this
particular
case
and
said,
i
see
a
defendant
in
front
of
me
who
is
immature,
as
mature
as
the
other
defendants,
and
this
study
backs
me
up.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
reminder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
i--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
--because
it...
because
it
sets
a
presumptive
sentence
and
that
presumptive
sentence
is
exactly
like...
is
the
guideline
sentence.
and
it
says
to
the
district
court:
you
must
overcome
a
presumption
against
a
sentence
that
is
some
unspecified
distance
from...
from
the
guidelines.
we
don't
know
because
we
can't
estimate
exactly
how
far
it's
from.
but
what
happens,
and
what
will
quickly
happen,
is
that
there's
going
to
be
a
kind
of...
maybe
in
the
eighth
circuit
it's
one
standard
deviation;
maybe
in
the
second
circuit
it's
two
standard
deviations.
but
pretty
soon
we
are
going
to
have
a
kind
of
guidelines
with
a
penumbra
beyond
which
you
can't
go.
it
is,
as
was
indicated
in
the
rita
opinion,
a
presumption
of
unreasonableness.
it
says
to
the
district
court,
you're
making
a
risk
if
you
go
outside
the
guidelines.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
green
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
most
bluntly,
an
i-know-it-when-i-see-it
test
or
a
holistic
test
is
not
likely
to
generate
much
in
the
way
of
warranted
uniformity
either.
justice
scalia,
you
pointed
out,
in
your
question
about
whether
this
sentence
was
excessive
or
not
on
the
basis
of
the...
of
the
facts,
that
the
government
is
blowing
smoke
with
respect
to
its
statement
that
the
guidelines
is
purely
advisory.
well,
it's
not
only
doing
that;
it's
removing
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
judge.
it's
saying
to
the
district
judge,
you
must
demonstrate
to
us
facts.
you
must
come
to
us
with
facts
that
not
only
consist
of
explanations
of
reasons
but
are
sufficiently
persuasive
or
compelling
to
overcome
our
natural
resistance
to
an
outside-the-guidelines
sentence.
that
i
submit
is,
as
articulated
earlier,
making
the
guidelines
presumptive.
and
it
imposes
a
fact-finding
requirement
that
is
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
about
whether
the
prosecutor
had,
in
fact,
heard
all
of
the
evidence
with
respect
to...
or
stated
all
the
evidence
to
the
district
court
with
respect
to
mr.
gall.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
he
most
certainly
did.
and
i
agree
with
my
colleague
that
this
case
is
the
mirror
of
rita.
in
rita,
the
district
judge
was
presented
with
a
wealth
of
facts
about
mr.
rita's
prior
good
works,
his
military
service,
et
cetera.
here,
the
district
judge
was
again
presented
with
a
wealth
of
facts
with
respect
to
mr.
gall's
voluntary
rehabilitation,
with
respect
to
his
having
grown,
developed,
and
established
a
business
and
rid
himself
of
crime
and
drugs.
and
this
district
judge
exercised
his
discretion
to
go
down
on
the
basis
of
those
facts
and
imposed
a
sentence
of
probation.
and,
justice
stevens,
the
eighth
circuit,
even
before
the
guidelines,
even
before
the
booker
case,
in
1993,
in
1999,
in
cases
called
one
star
and
decora
respectively,
went
down
from
even
higher
levels
to
probation
based
upon
the
particular
facts
of
the
case.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
overturn
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
abandon
the
extraordinary
circumstances
test.
thank
you.
