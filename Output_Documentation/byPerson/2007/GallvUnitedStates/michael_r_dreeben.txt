mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
appellate
courts
confronted
with
the
task
of
conducting
reasonableness
review
need
some
benchmarks
for
how
to
distinguish
between
sentences
that
are
outside
the
guidelines
and
reasonable
and
sentences
that
are
outside
the
guidelines
and
are
not.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
an
appellate
court
can
reasonably
decide
that
it
should
take
a
harder
look
at
a
case
that
is
significantly
or
extraordinarily
outside
the
guidelines
and
look
to
see
whether
that
sentence
is
supported
by--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
stevens,
we
don't
have
a
fixed
percentage.
we
don't
endorse
that
kind
of
analysis.
i
think
that
the
appropriate
way
to
look
at
it
is
to
see
all
different
factors
converging
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
warrants
this
harder
look.
it
could
be
a
different
type
of
sentence.
here
you
have
a
probation
sentence
as
opposed
to
a
prison
sentence
when
the
guidelines
call
for
up
to
three
years
of
imprisonment.
it
could
be
couched
in
the
number
of
levels
that
the
judge
has--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't.
but
i
would
say--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
courts
of
appeals
have
generally
relied
on
a
"i
know
it
when
i
see
it.
"
kind
of
approach,
which
i
think
is
reasonable
in
this
area
of
the
law,
because
you
see
sentences
that
are
simply
out
of
kilter
with
what
the
guidelines
range
is,
and
it
raises
a
question
in
the
court's
mind,
why?
if
you
saw
a
judge
who
said
the
guidelines
range
here
is
30
to
37
months
for
petitioner
and
i'm
going
to
sentence
him
to
24
months
and
the
judge
gives
the
same
reasons
as
he
gave
here,
no
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
think
this
requires
a
particularly
hard
look
or
any
greater
justification
than
what
the
judge
did.
the
court
will
understand
that
that's
what
abuse
of
discretion
review
means
in
an
advisory
system.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
is,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because,
justice
scalia,
i
start
with
a
fundamentally
different
concept
of
reasonableness
review
than
merely
is
it
possible
to
articulate
a
reasoned
basis
for
sentencing
the
defendant
that
way.
i
start
with
the
proposition
that
this
court
adopted
reasonableness
review
in
booker
as
a
means
of
helping
to
achieve
congress's
objective
of
increased
uniformity
without
attempting
to
attain
the
degree
of
uniformity
that
had
prevailed
under
the
mandatory--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
there's
a
difference,
justice
scalia,
from
saying
that
the
guidelines
are
advisory
and
therefore
a
court
can
give
a
different
sentence
than
what
the
guidelines
call
for,
and
saying
that
basically
advisory
guidelines
means
the
judge
can
do
whatever
policy
judgment
the
judge
wants,
without
regard
to
what
degree
of
variance
you
achieve.
from--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
you
can
disagree
fundamentally,
and
i
think
at
one
level
every
variance
is
a
disagreement
with
the
sentence
that
the
guidelines
would
produce.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
fits
in
with
my
prior
statement
because
what's
at
issue
in
a
case
like
this
is
not
whether
the
judge
can
disagree
with
the
judgment
of
the
guidelines
and
say
youth
matters,
but
whether
the
judge
can
do
so
to
such
an
extent
that
the
result
is
unwarranted
disparity
beyond
what
needs
to
be
tolerated
in
order
to
achieve
a
system
that
complies
with
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
has
to
be
a
substantive
fairness
component,
justice
souter,
and
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantive
excessiveness
component.
in
other
words--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
actually
view
it
as
the
broader
category
but
i
think
the
two
of
them
work
together.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
is
the
fundamental
difference
that
i
think
exists
between
what
petitioner
is
offering
and
what
the
government
is
offering.
we
all
agree
that
irrational
sentences
and
procedurally
defective
sentences
are
to
be
set
aside
on
reasonableness
review.
but
where
we
disagree,
i
think,
is
whether
a
judge
on
a
court
of
appeals
panel
can
look
at
the
results
reached
by
the
district
judge
and
conclude,
this
is
an
excessive
sentence
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
think
that
the
judge
can
do
that
on
a
court
of
appeals
and
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
a
sentence
is
excessive,
a
starting
point
is
to
compare
what
the
judge
did
to
what
the
guidelines
range
does.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
unless,
justice
scalia,
the
judge
offers
sufficiently
cogent,
persuasive
reasons
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
concludes
that
this
is
indeed
a
reasonable
sentence,
given
the
reasons
that
the
judge
has
articulated
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
the
facts
before
him.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he...
he
did
say
that
justice
scalia.
but
appellate
review
is
conducted
through
the
lens
of
3553(a)
and
3553(a)
directs
the
judge
to
consider
a
variety
of
things
in
addition
to
the
history
and
characteristics
of
the
defendant,
which
is
where
youth
comes
in.
it
also
directs
the
court
to
consider
the
severity
of
the
offense
and
the
need
for
just
punishment.
it
directs
the
court
to
consider
deterrence
considerations,
and
it
directs
the
court
to
consider
the
need
to
avoid
unwarranted
disparities
between
similarly
situated
defendants,
and
that's
where
this
court
fell
down.
it's
not
that
what
the
court
said
was
wholly
unreasonable,
although
in
one
respect,
i
think,
with
the
emphasis
on
withdrawal
for
the
reasons
that
justice
ginsburg
mentioned,
the
judge
did
overstate
the
point.
but
the
judge
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
defendant
who
over
a
7-month
period
engaged
in
a
sustained
drug
conspiracy
at
age
21,
not
as
an
adolescent,
and
made
30
to
$40,000
for
that.
and
the
result
is
that
this
judge
concluded
that
defendant--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
i
think
that
there
are
cases
throughout
the
federal
system
that
have
resulted
in
probation
for
defendants
who
committed
similar
crimes
to
this,
maybe
not
as
severe
as
this
defendant.
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
ones
that,
i
think,
have
been
the
most
appealing
for
probation
sentences
are
cases
in
which
the
defendant's
culpability
is
very
low.
the
defendant
played
a
minor
role
in
the
offense,
perhaps
assisting
a
boyfriend
or
a
friend--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
only
cases
that
i
can
think
of...
and
i
was
trying
to
get
to
this
point,
justice
stevens...
are
ones
in
which
courts
conclude
there
are
compelling
family
circumstances
where
individuals
will
be
very
badly
hurt
in
the
defendant's
family
if
no
one
is
available
to
take
care
of
them,
and
the
defendant
has
really
devoted
his
activities
to
doing
that,
and
there's
no
replacement;
and
the
costs
to
society
would
be
too
high
in
those
circumstances,
courts
have
concluded,
to
justify
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
i'm
not
saying
that
petitioner
is
the
most
culpable
defendant
that
could
be
sentenced
under
this
statute.
this
is
a
statute
that
carries
a
range--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--let
me
try
to
draw
one
distinction
and
make
a
point
about
proportionality
that
i
think
is
not
encompassed
within
what
you
said.
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
judge
forming
a
view
based
on
the
defendant's
character
and
behavior
in
front
of
the
court
and
the
history
as
revealed
in
the
presentence
report
where
the
judge
has
an
institutional
advantage
over
an
appellate
court
for
obvious
reasons.
and
this
was
recognized
in
koon
versus
united
states.
it
hasn't
changed
today.
on
the
other
hand,
a
district
court
has
a
disadvantage,
really,
in
formulating
broad
policy
as
compared
to
the
sentencing
commission.
because
the
sentencing
commission
has
the
ability
to
absorb
vast
amounts
of
data
and
to
consider
the
views
of
all
segments
of
the
criminal
justice
community
and
to
respond
to
congress.
and
it
is
really
the
component
of
the
sentencing
process
where
you
would
expect
broad
policy
to
be,
as
an
initial
matter,
best
formulated.
now--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
i
said
to
justice
scalia,
they're
not
mandatory,
and
the
judge
does
have
the
freedom
to
challenge
the
judgment
that
the
sentencing
commission
has
drawn.
but
on
appellate
review,
the
normal
factors
that
go
into
which
institutional
actor
is
best
situated
to
decide
a
question
tilts
in
favor
of
a
more
rigorous
form
of
review
for
pure
policy
disagreements
for
not
only
the
reason
that
the
sentencing
commission
is
better,
but
for
the
reason
that
if
you
license
all
district
courts
to
come
up
with
their
own
broad,
abstract
policies,
you
end
up
with
474
sentencing
commissions
who
are
operating--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
hope
not,
justice
breyer.
and
i
hope
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
i
said,
the
section
3553(a)
process
is
a
holistic
one.
there
are
seven
different
factors
listed
in
section
3553(a);
and
the
commission,
when
it
formulated
the
guidelines,
looked
at
the
same
sorts
of
factors
and
attempted
to
balance
them.
this
judge
here
did
not
devote
particularly
significant
consideration
at
all
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
sold
10,000
ecstasy
pills,
which
have
the
potential
for
causing
significant
harm.
and
he
earned
a
great
deal
of
money
out
of
it.
he
didn't
give
the
money
back.
he
may
have
invested
it
in
the
house
that
he
bought.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
reasonableness
requires
more
of
a
balance
of
the
policies
and
a
consideration
of
the
overall
goal
of
the
system
of
achieving
uniformity.
and
i
think
perhaps
the
best
way
to
illustrate
the
point
is
through
a
hypothetical
similar
to
the
one
that
justice
kennedy
posed.
suppose
that
a
district
judge,
confronting
petitioner,
said:
you
were
a
college
student.
you
had
every
advantage
in
life.
you
were
21;
you
weren't
a
kid.
you
made
$40,000
over
seven
months.
and
when
it
suited
you,
you
pulled
out,
and
you
did
nothing
to
disrupt
the
conspiracy.
now,
i
have
a
statutory
range
here
of
zero
to
20.
and,
although
the
guidelines
call
only
for
30
to
37
months,
i
think
you
should
go
to
jail
for
15
years.
i
don't
see
petitioner
as
really
offering
a
court
of
appeals
or
the
criminal-justice
system
as
a
whole
a
way
for
someone
to
step
in
and
say
that's
excessive.
it
doesn't
leave
room
to
make
reasoned
distinctions
among
the
kinds
of
defendants
who
violate
this
statute,
and
it
doesn't
provide
any
check
on
aberrant
or
outlier
outcomes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
the
competing
rule
of
mere
rationality
or
the
judge
did
something
that's
reasonable
is
pretty
much
a
one-way
ticket
to
disparity.
because
it
means
that
every
district
judge
would
get
the
opportunity
to
say:
i've
seen
the
guidelines,
but
i
don't
agree;
and,
as
a
result,
i'm
giving
the
15-year
sentence
to
mr.
gall
versus
all
the
way
down
to
probation,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
would
have
to
affirm
both.
now,
i
am
trying--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
question
i
think
here
is
how
advisory
do
they
have
to
be
in
order
to
comply
with
this
court's
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
and
the
remedial
opinion
in
booker,
as
i
understand
it,
answered
that
question
by
saying
they're
not
mandatory,
but
the
features
of
the
appellate
review
and
continued
existence
of
the
sentencing
commission
are
going
to
work
significantly
to
achieving
congress's
objectives
of
increased
uniformity.
and
the
nine
courts
of
appeals
that
have
adopted
proportionality
review,
even
if
they
may
have
used
slightly
different
words
to
express
it,
are...
i
think,
responding
to
a
fundamental
intuition,
which
is
how
do
i
know
if
the
sentence
in
front
of
me
is
likely
to
be
significantly
outside
the
norm.
and
second,
if
it
is,
should
i
not
look
for
more
to
sustain
it
than
a
sentence
that's
co-extensive
with
the
guidelines
sentence.
i
think
this
case
is
really
the
counterpart
case
to
the
rita
case
that
the
court
decided
last
term
when
that
judgment
of
the
sentencing
court
and
the
district
judge...
the
sentencing
commission
and
the
district
judge
coincide,
courts
of
appeals
can
assume
it's
likely,
although
not
definitely
true...
but
likely
that
the
sentence
is
a
reasonable
one.
but
when
the
sentence
is
significantly
outside
what
the
guidelines
would
call
for
on
an
average
case
of
that
type--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
am
not
able
to
give
the
court
a
rigid
definition
of
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
treat
what
i'm
arguing
for
as
a
presumption,
but
if
the
court
wants
to
conclude
that
it
does
function
like
a
presumption,
i
would
still
submit
it
is
a
perfectly
valid
presumption
under
these
circumstances.
it
is
not
that
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
do.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
presumption
of
unreasonableness
goes
a
little
bit
farther
than
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
it
allows
the
court
of
appeals
to
take
notice
that
this
is
a
sentence
that
if
upheld
holds
the
potential
for
unwarranted
disparity.
and
it
may
be
that
the
sentence
doesn't
pose
that
risk
at
all.
but
the
reasons
that
the
judge
gave
to
justify
that
sentence
should
be
somewhat
commensurate
or
proportionate
to
the
degree
of
the
variance,
otherwise
you're
basically
back
to
a
system
where
so
long
as
the
judge
can
go
through
the
facts
of
the
case
and
give
a
rational
explanation
of
why
a
sentence
should
be
at
that
level,
there's
nothing
for
the
appellate
court
to
do
but
to
affirm.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
you'd
be
doing
i
think,
justice
breyer,
is
sweeping
aside
the
approach
that
nine
circuits
have
taken.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
which
have
usefully
facilitated
their
appellate
review.
they
didn't
select
the
standard
because
they
drew
it
out
of
an
opinion
from
this
court.
they
selected
the
standard
because
they
considered
it
essentially
a
rule
of
reason.
the
rule
being
that
under
an
advisory
guideline
system,
we
must
accept
that
there
will
be
considerably
less
uniformity
than
under
a
mandatory
system.
that's
appropriate.
but
we
don't
have
to
accept
the
proposition
that
materially
outlier
sentences
that
are
not
supported
by
an
adequate
explanation
should
stand.
and
if
the
courts
of
appeals
are
told,
you
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
now,
you
can't
use
any
kind
of
proportionality
test,
i
think
unless
the
court
gives
them
something
that
will
allow
them
to
distinguish
between
a
materially
out
of
guideline
sentence
that
is
reasonable
and
one
that
is
not,
the
ultimate
result
will
be
every
district
judge
knowing
that
in
their
courtroom,
they
can
decide
whatever
they
like
about
the
fundamental
policies
of
sentences,
and
it
will
stand.
the
reason
why
the
sentencing
guidelines
system
was
originally
adopted
was
to
eliminate
each
district
judge
operating
purely
on
that
judge's
philosophy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
think
that
what
the
district
judges
need
to
understand
is
that
they're
not
bound
by
the
guidelines,
but
the
guidelines
remain
something
that
is
a
reference
point,
that
if
deviations
or
variances
are
warranted,
they
should
be
explained,
and
they
should
be
explained
in
a
way
that's
consistent
with
the
degree
of
the
variance.
because
the
alternative
of
wholesale
abdication
to
the
district
judge
to
assess
the
individual
facts
of
the
case
means
that
one
district
judge
can
conclude
that
a
defendant
like
mr.
gall
warrants
probation,
and
another
one
can
conclude
that
he
warrants
10
or
15
years,
and
there'll
be
no
remedy
on
appeal
because
it
will
all
be
very
case-specific.
it
won't
be
policy
driven
disagreements.
most
of
what
goes
on
in
federal
sentencing
is
not
fundamentally
a
deep-rooted
policy
disagreement
of
the
nature
of
the
kind
that
justice
scalia
and
i
were
discussing,
about
whether
white
collar
defendants
should
go
to
jail
at
all.
most
of
it
is
about
how
do
the
particular
features
of
this
individual
defendant
match
up
with
the
policy
considerations--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
more
of
a
wholistic
and
judgmental
process
than
a
mathematical
one,
justice
stevens.
and
i
am
reluctant
to
offer
percentages
because
i
don't
want
to
be
mistaken
for
saying
there
is
some
litmus
test
with
superguidelines,
ranges...
but
i
can
say
that
courts
of
appeals
that
find
a
variance
to
warrant
a
substantial
or
extraordinary
justification
are
typically
looking
at
40
to
50
to
60
percent
away
from
the
guidelines
range,
not
sentences
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
calls
for
one
that
makes
sense
given
the
degree
of
the
various--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--linguistically,
the
words
used
are,
you
need
a
compelling
reason
for
an
extraordinary
departure...
an
extraordinary
reason
for
an
extraordinary
departure
or
variance.
so
in
that
sense,
i
agree
with
you.
but
the
court
of
appeals
have
not
attempted
to
create
a
mathematical
grid,
because
such
an
exercise
would
be
both
contrary
to
the
notion
of
advisory
guidelines,
and
also
one
that
is
inherently
arbitrary.
and
that's
why
i
said
that
it
is
unfortunately
more
in
the
nature
of,
i
know
it
when
i
see
it,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
is
as
bad
as
the
predicament
the
court
found
itself
in
in
obscenity
cases,
because
it
really
isn't
that
hard
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
variance
that
is
a
few
months
outside
the
range
or
even
a
variance
in
the
facts
of
this
gall
case,
say
down
to
15
months,
and
a
sentence
that
just
wipes
out
all
prison
time
altogether.
i
don't
think
the
court
should
have
any
difficulty
saying
that
if
a
judge
is
just
going
to
wipe
out
all
prison
time--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
in
this
case,
because
the
government
believes
that
the
guidelines
provide
a
reference
point
for
proportionality
review,
a
sentence--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--stronger,
i
would
say,
because
if
the
guidelines--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--excuse
me.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
i
think
that...
that's
why
i
don't
think
you
can
confine
it
to
percentage.
i
think
if
the
guidelines
are
calling
for
a
very
substantial
period
of
imprisonment,
and
a
judge
says,
i
just
don't
think
the
culpability
of
white
collar
offenders
ever
warrants
sending
them
to
jail,
i
think
the
better
approach
is
you
have
them
go
out
and
make
speeches
to
fellow
potential
defendants
about
how
terrible
their
experience
was,
that
is
something
that's
going
to
produce
a
very
widespread
potential
for
disparity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
think
that
courts
of
appeals
conducting
reasonableness
review
should
in
effect
construct
their
own
guidelines
system.
they
should
respond
to
the
reasons
and
the
facts
that
are
before
them.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
i
think
you're
not
accomplishing
that
kind
of
a
common
law
system
in
reasonableness
review
for
many
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
has
already
identified
in
describing
why
an
abuse-of-discretion
approach
is
warranted.
the
court
of
appeals
will
not
be
saying
that
this
is
the
maximum
sentence
you
could
give
on
these
facts.
it
would
say
these...
this
is
an
unreasonable
or
a
reasonable
sentence
based
on
the
policy
considerations
that
the
judge
articulated
and
the
facts
that
he
relied
on.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
fundamental
question
of
whether
there
is
substantive
reasonableness
review
for
excessiveness
was
settled
in
the
rita
an
opinion
in
which...
rita
recognized
that
booker
contemplated--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
my
response...
and
if
i
could
answer
mr.
chief
justice...
is
that
the
fundamental
point
of
this
court's
apprendi
line
of
cases
is
that,
so
long
as
the
statutory
maximum
is
legally
available
to
the
judge,
the
judge
can
find
facts
within
that
range
that
justify
the
sentence,
and
that's
all
the
booker
remedial
opinion
authorizes
judges
to
do.
thank
you.
