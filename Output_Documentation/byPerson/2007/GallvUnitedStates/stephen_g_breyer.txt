justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
in
your
opinion
is
supposed
to
happen
if
we
have
guidelines,
a
part
of
3553(a),
a
part
of
it...
voluntary
or
not,
they're
referred
to,
so...
and
i
understand
how
you
would
deal
with
this.
if
the
district
judge's
sentence
rests
upon
his
view
of
the
facts,
the
appeals
court
is
supposed
to
say
it's
the
district
judge
that
counts
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
understand
if
it's
a
question
of
judgment,
a
matter
of
judgment
about
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
say:
district
judge,
it's
your
view
that
matters
here.
now,
the
difficult
matter
is,
suppose
that
this
district
judge
says:
i
don't
approve
of
the
way
guidelines
treat
a
certain
class
of
people
and
i
am
going
to
have
a
different
sentence
because
i
don't
like
what
they
do.
and
now
there
are
several
situations:
one,
different
from
his
fellow
judges
in
the
same
court;
two,
different
from
other
judges
across
the
country;
three,
different
from
what
the
guidelines
did
initially;
four,
different
from
what
the
guidelines
say
after
the
commission
has
over
and
over
and
over
reconsidered
the
same
matter.
all
right,
that
i
find
difficult
and
i'd
like
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that...
which
is
the
subject
of
the
next
case,
really--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
want
to
know
your
view
of
it.
too.
i
want
to
know
your
view
of
it,
too,
because
what
i
want
to
figure
out
here
by
the
end
of
today
is
what
are
the
words
that
should
be
written
in
your
opinion
by
this
court
that
will
lead
to
considerable
discretion
on
part
of
the
district
judge
but
not
totally,
not
to
the
point
where
the
uniformity
goal
is
easily
destroyed.
that's
what
i'm
asking
your
view
on,
and
i'd
like
your
view
and
the
sg's
view
and
everyone
else
who's
arguing
today.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
case,
though,
that
i
think
would
give
tremendous
discretion
to
the
district
judge.
because,
as
i
just
listened
to
you,
you
are
listing
a
whole
lot
of
features
of
it
that
are
very
case-specific,
that
require
thorough
knowledge
of
fact
and
thorough
knowledge
of
the
kind
of
judgment,
a
kind
of
individualized
judgment,
that
sentencing
judges
are
supposed
to
do.
and
that's
what's
worrying
me
about
the
test
that
the
circuit
court
gives
here.
it
lumps
together
things
like
what
you
just
talked
about
with
other
things
like:
i
don't
agree
with
the
policy
of
the
guideline,
itself.
and
this
is
a
typical
case
and,
therefore,
i
think
we
should
look
to
try
to
find
ways
to
unpack
the
sentence
that
it
used,
the
statement...
you
know,
the
worse
it
is,
the
worse
the
harder
you
look,
et
cetera,
because
that
doesn't
tell
us
much
at
all.
it
suggests
a
proportionate
test,
mathematical,
which
must
be
wrong.
it
must
be
wrong
because
the
same
degree
of
departure
could
result
from
a
view
of
an
abuse
of
a
vulnerable
victim
as
could
result
from
a
total
misunderstanding
of
what
robbery
is
about.
now,
it's
not
the
percentage
there
that
matters.
it's
the
rationale.
it
is
what
the
judge
did.
and
can
you
unpack
it?
we
just
did
in
the
last
discussion
try
to
unpack
that,
and
we
continue
in
the
next
case
to
try
to
do
it.
what
we
want...
i
think
what
we
want...
is
to
interpret
that
word
"reasonable"
so
that
we
get
back
to
a
situation
where
judges
do
depart
when
they
have
something
unusual
and
maybe
occasionally
when
they
think
the
guideline
wasn't
considered
properly,
and
then
the
iterative
process
takes
over,
going
back
to
the
commission.
now,
how
do
we
get
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
on
that
ground
i
understand
perfectly,
and
were
we
to
write
that
into
a
paragraph
in
the
opinion,
this
case
still,
would
it
not,
be
the
strongest
case
imaginable
for
discretion
to
the
district
judge?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
did,
but
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
were
going
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
that
always
true?
a
judge
should
always
give
reasons
commensurate
with
the
problem.
so
what
if
we
added
by
saying
remember
give
reasons
commensurate
with
the
problem?
i
see
something
we've
lost.
what
we've
lost
is
we've
sort
of
pulled
across
the
screen
here
a
rather
murky
curtain
called
"something
of
a
presumption",
which
we
can't
quite
define,
which
will
lead
to
lawyers
making
endless
arguments
about
whether
this
murky
curtain...
they're
on
one
side
of
it
or
the
other.
so
let's
sweep
its
aside.
let's
get
to
the
underlying
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
were
making
progress?
i
thought
our
last
discussion...
we
were
making
progress
on
this
very
point,
where
we
have
the
judgmental
matters,
the
fact
finding
matters,
and
the
pure
policy
matters,
and
we
distinguished
the
latter
from
the
first
two?
if
you
were
a
district
judge,
wouldn't
you
find
it
more
enlightening
to
talk
in
those
terms?
