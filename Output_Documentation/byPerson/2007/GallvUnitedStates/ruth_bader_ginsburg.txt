what
about
the
eighth
circuit,
laying
aside
the
extraordinary
circumstances
test,
saying
the
judge,
the
sentencing
judge
gave
credit
for
his
leaving
the
conspiracy,
but
he
didn't
blow
the
whistle,
so
the
conspiracy
continued.
he
could
have
stopped
the
conspiracy.
and,
similarly,
yes,
he
rehabilitated
himself,
but
he
earned
some
30
to
$40,000
in
the
drug
business,
and
that
aided
his
rehabilitation,
and
maybe
there's
some
kind
of
obligation
to
pay
back.
so
could
a
court
of
appeals
try
to
instruct
district
judges
and
say:
now,
in
this
factor,
leaving
a
conspiracy,
we
want
district
judges
to
be
aware
of
the
difference
between
one
who
leaves
and
blows
the
whistle
and
one
who
lets
it
continue;
and,
similarly,
one
who
uses
the
ill-gotten
gains
to
set
himself
up
in
business.
justice

there
is
no
indication
that
he
gave
it
back,
or
there
was
no
fine
attached
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
can
it
fix
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
said...
you
said
before
that,
and
very
definitely,
that
congress
could
fix
the
case
of
where
one
judge
said,
i'm
always
lenient
on
17-year-olds
and
the
other
said,
i
throw
the
book
at
him.
you
said
yes,
congress
could
fix
that.
well,
how
other
than
in
the
way
that
justice
alito
just
proposed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
in
your
view
would
be...
would
fail
the
abuse
of
discretion
test?
if
we
have
a
sentence
of...
what
was
the
guideline
range?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
judge
gives
no
prison
time,
three
years
probation.
what
would
it
take
to
be...
describe
what
an
abuse
of
discretion
would
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sure
that
the
prosecutor
argued
that,
and
the
judge
heard
it,
and
he
listed
what
thought
were
the
key
factors.
you
made
a
distinction
between
a
sentence
could
be
rational
but
not
reasonable.
and
i'm
accustomed
to
understanding
rationality
review
as
equivalent
to
reasonableness
review,
but
you
made
a
distinction
between
those
two.
so
i
get
your
idea
of
rationality
passes
the
lunatic
test.
what
is
reasonableness?
