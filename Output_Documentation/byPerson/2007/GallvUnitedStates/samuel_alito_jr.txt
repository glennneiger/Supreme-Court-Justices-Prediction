justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
your
argument
that
if
any
rational
judge
could
impose
the
sentence
that's
imposed,
then
that
sentence
has
to
be
sustained.
so
you're
saying
that
either
the
district
court
or
the
eighth
circuit
here
was
irrational?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
but
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
you
hesitated
in
saying
that,
if
the
district
court
had
taken
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
would
also
have
to
be
sustained.
but
under
your
analysis
wouldn't
it
have
to
be
unless
you're
going
to
argue--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
that
approach
is
irrational?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
the
judge
have
to
consider
the
cases
from
the
judge's
district
or
from
the
circuit
or
from
the
whole
country?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
congress
pass
a
statute
that
says
age
is
not
relevant
in
sentencing
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances?
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
congress
can
pass
a
statute
without
violating
the
sixth
amendment
saying
age
is
ordinarily
not
relevant,
then
could
congress
delegate
to
an
expert
agency
the
authority
to
make
that
decision
without
violating
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
based
on
what?
why
could
it...
why
can't
it
delegate
the
authority
if
it
can
do
it
itself?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
maybe
you
could
take
age.
what
is
there
about
the
age
of
this
defendant?
he
was
a
21-year-old
college
student?
now
maybe
age
is
generally
a
factor
that
should
be
considered
as
a
basis
for
leniency.
maybe
it's
not.
but
it's
a
policy
question.
what
is
there
about
the
facts
of
this
case
that...
that
changes
that?
