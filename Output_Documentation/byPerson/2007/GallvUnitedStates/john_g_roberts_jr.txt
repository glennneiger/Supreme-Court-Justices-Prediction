chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-7949,
gall
v.
united
states.
mr.
green.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
that's
not
always
true.
i
mean,
if
the
leader
of
some
vast
conspiracy
is
the
one
who
blows
the
whistle,
i
suspect
he
may
well
be
charged
anyway.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
what's
left
of
the
appellate
review?
i
mean,
under
your
theory
is
there
any
substantive
review
for
the
appellate
court
or
is
it
all
just
procedural
under...
putting
aside
your
logical
coherence
point,
which--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
a
typical
abuse
of
discretion
review,
you
still
have...
for
example,
if
you
have
a
judge
in...
well,
let's
say
you
have
a
judge;
in
one
case
he
says
because
this
is
a...
a
young
defendant,
i'm
going
to
give
him
a
lighter
sentence;
and
in
the
next
case
says,
you
know,
i
don't
think
age
is
a
factor
that
i
should
consider
in
the
case;
in
the
next
case
he
says
it
is
and
then
not.
each...
all
of
those
cases,
i
take
it,
are
upheld
under
your
view
on
appellate
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
can
be
substantive
review
for
consideration
of
age?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
so
at
the
same
time--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
if
you
have
two
district
judges
in
the
same
courthouse
and
the
one
says,
when
i
have
a
young
defendant
i
always...
i
forget
whether
the
term
is
"vary"
or
"depart"...
but
i
always
go
down,
and
the
next
judge
says,
i
never
consider
age.
those...
both
of
those
are
upheld
under
your
view,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
exactly--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--isn't
that
exactly
what
the
sentencing
commission
did
in
establishing
the
guidelines?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
green,
i
understood
you
to
respond
to
justice
souter's
question
that
courts
of
appeals
could
consider
a
broader
range
of
cases
in
deciding
whether
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
a
particular
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
if
they
can
consider
a
broader
range
of
cases,
what's
so
bad
about
suggesting
that
if
a
particular
case
is
way
out
of
what
their
broad
review
shows,
if
the
broad
review
shows
that
in
most
cases
this
type
of
defendant
gets
5
years
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
judge
gave
him
30
years
or
gave
him
zero,
what's
wrong
with
suggesting
that
that
is
a
factor
they
should
at
least
start
with
in
saying
something's
unusual
about
this
case,
we
ought
to
take
closer
look?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
what's
the
point
of
looking
at
the
broad
range
of
cases
if
they
can't
do
anything
about
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
it
right
to
say
if
the
broad
range
shows
that
most
of
these
defendants
get
a
sentence
of
10
years
in
jail
and
in
this
case
the
person
got
probation,
that
the
court
should
look
for
some
reasons
to
explain
what
the
difference,
to
justify
the
difference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
give
you
rebuttal
time,
mr.
green,
but
i
just
have
one
question.
i
think
we've
gotten
off
the
track
a
little
bit.
the
question
presented
is
about
the
extraordinary
circumstances
test
and
proportionality
review.
we've
been
talking
a
lot
about
what
district
court
judges
can
do.
what's
wrong
with,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
saying
if
something
is
out
of
the
norm,
you
ought
to
have
some
good
reason
for
being
out
of
the
norm?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
only
question
presented
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
green.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
should...
i'm
sorry.
but
i
mean...
the
only
purpose
of
the
presumption
under
your
view
is
to
trigger
some
inquiry
into
the
reasons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
3553(a),
district
courts
have
to
provide
reasons
anyway,
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
there
is
no
explanation
of
the
reasons
it
is
going
to
be
invalid
under
the
statute,
quite
apart
from
any
presumption
of
unreasonableness.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
green,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
why
don't
you
take
three?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
green.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
for
the
court
today
in
case
number
06-7949,
gall
versus
united
states,
which
he
has
asked
me
to
announce.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
petitioner
gall
pleaded
guilty
to
participating
in
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
a
controlled
substance.
he
had
voluntarily
withdrawn
from
the
conspiracy
and
ceased
using
drugs
some
three
years
prior
to
his
indictment.
after
a
full
sentencing
hearing,
the
district
judge
decided
to
sentence
petitioner
to
probation
for
a
term
of
36
months
instead
of
imposing
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
within
the
30
to
37
month
range
recommended
by
the
sentencing
guidelines.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
for
resentencing
because
it
concluded
that
petitioner's
sentence
was
not
supported
by
a
justification
that
was
proportional
to
the
extent
of
the
difference
between
the
advisory
range
and
the
sentence
that
was
imposed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reversed
for
reasons
stated
in
a
21-page
opinion.
we
hold
that
while
the
extent
of
the
difference
between
a
particular
sentence
and
the
recommended
guidelines
range
is
surely
relevant.
courts
of
appeals
must
review
all
sentences
whether
inside
or
outside
the
guidelines
range
under
a
deferential
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
we
also
hold
that
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
district
judge
in
this
case
was
reasonable.
justice
scalia
and
justice
souter
have
filed
separate
concurring
opinions.
justice
thomas
and
justice
alito
have
filed
separate
dissenting
opinions.
