justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
the
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
why...--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
wouldn't
the
judge
in,
as
it
were,
the
second
case
give
some
consideration,
be
required
under
abuse
review
to
give
some
consideration,
to
what
is
sort
of
the
norm
in
that
circuit
so
that
he
doesn't
stand
out
as
either
a
"let-them-loose"
judge
or
a
hanging
judge?
doesn't
abuse
of
discretion
at
least
require
a
broader
view
than
simply
the...
literally
the
case
before
the
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
wouldn't
there
be
at
least
under
the
chief
justices's
hypothetical,
wouldn't
there
be
a
possibility
of
looking
to
those
other
cases
rather
than
just
automatically
affirming
on...
on
abuse
review?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying...
you're
saying
two
things.
you're
saying
it's
got
to
follow
the
guidelines...
it
can
depart
from
the
guidelines,
but
it's
got
to
do
so
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case
or
in
some
way
relevant
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
when
you
put
that
latter
criterion
in
there,
what
you're
saying,
and
i
think
this
was
justice
scalia's
concern,
you're
really
saying
you've
got
to
find
that
this
case
is
somehow
an
outlier
to
the
broad
range
of
cases
so
that
the
policy
does
not
fit.
and
that's
a
different
thing
from
a
general
disagreement
with
the
policy
itself.
isn't
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
is
it
in
the
facts
of
this
case
that
is
crucial
to
the
appropriate
determination?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
but
if
the
reasoning
that
you
just
articulated
is
reasoning
that
should
be
accepted,
it's
reasoning
that
should
be
accepted
in
every
case.
and
it...
i.e.,
the
mind
is
less...
the
brain
is
less
developed
in
the
case
of
everyone
under
a
certain
age.
and
that
amounts,
in
effect,
to
a
rejection
of
the
policy
for
a
certain
swath
of
individuals,
relatively
young
individuals,
for
whom
the
judge
is
saying
age
is
relevant,
the
policy
says
age
is
not.
that's
rejection
of
the
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
that
if
a
judge
disagrees
as
a
general
matter
of
policy,
once
in
a
while
he
could
make
an
exception
to
his
disagreement.
but
it's
still,
it
seems
to
me,
on
your
reasoning,
that
he
has
rejected
the
policy
with
respect
to
a
certain
class
of
defendant.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
that
there's
a
fairness
component
to
the
guidelines
in
reasonableness
review.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
start
talking
about
disparity,
you're
talking
about
a
fairness
across
a
range
of
sentencing
that
is
actually
imposed.
so
you're
saying...
i
think
you're
saying,
there's
got
to
be
a
kind
of
substantive
fairness
component
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
kind
after
subset,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
