justice
john
paul
stevens
one
question.
why
couldn't,
if
there
is
some
kind
of
substantive
standard
of
reasonableness,
why
couldn't
a
court
of
appeals
in
a
particular
circuit
say
that...
if
one
judge
relies
on
age,
19,
and
the
other
judges
do
not,
why
couldn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
one
of
those
two
positions
is
unreasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
could
be
a
common...
sort
of
a
common
law
of
reasonableness
developed
through
the
public
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
we've
been
talking
about
a
lot
of
hypotheticals.
is
there
any
dispute,
any
claim
that
any
of
the
facts
on
which
the
district
judge
relied
in
this
case
were
improper--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
they
were
out
of
harmony
with
what's
done
throughout
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me,
may
i
ask
this
question
because
it
comes
up
throughout
your
brief,
and
you've
used
percentages
to
decide
when
a
case
is
sufficiently
outside
the
guidelines
to
justify
a
special
hard
look.
you
used
the
term
"dramatically"
in
your
brief.
at
what
percentage
point
is
the
threshold
that
this
standard
of
review
kicks
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
not
rely
on
a
percentage
as
kind
of
the
magic
basic
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
seem
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
do
you
think
there
are
any
facts
that
would
have
justified
probation
for
this
particular
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
difference
between
the
facts
in
this
case
and
the
ones
which
you
would
find
acceptable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
about
whether
in
cases
exactly
involving
the
crime
we
have
here,
whether
any
such
cases
would
justify
probation,
where
the
culpability
was
exactly
the
same
as
there
was
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
you
are
saying
that
you
admit
there's
no
presumption
of
unreasonable
merely
because
it
is
outside
but
there
is
a
presumption
of
reasonable
if
it
dramatically
or
significantly
is
outside
and
you
don't
define
dramatically
or
significantly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
able
to
give
any
definition.
you
disavow
a
percentage.
you
just
come
up
with
nothing
else.
just
the
word
dramatically.
you
do
say
it
is
a
presumption
at
that
point
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
dreeben,
can
i
ask
another
question?
i
go
back
to
percentages
for
just...
to
illustrate
the
point.
you
say
that
the
justification
has
to
be
responsive
to
the
extent
of
the
departure.
and
you...
you
kind
of
disavow
percentages
that
trigger...
you
say
substantial.
but
how
do
you
measure
the
strength
of
justifications?
for
example
in
this
case,
there
were
four
or
five
justifications...
withdrawal
from
a
conspiracy,
youth,
that
he
got
over
alcoholism,
so
forth.
is
the
judge
supposed
to
put
a
percentage
value
on
each
of
those
justifications
and
see
if
they
add
up
to
the
percentage?
and
if
not,
aren't
you
comparing
oranges
and
apples?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
call
for
a
40
to
50
percent
justification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
as
in
effect
saying
we've
got
to
get
a
percentage
that
matches
the
percentage
of
departure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you...
if
it
wipes
it
out
entirely,
does
that
make
this
case
different
or
like
a
case
in
which
the
maximum
was
say...
was
30
years
instead
of
30
months?
are
they
both
to
be
judged
by
the
same
standard
on
the
justification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
guidelines
provided
30
years?
would
the
justification
for
probation
in
that
case
have
to
be
just
as
strong
as
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
percentage
is
really
irrelevant--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would...
then
the
percentage
is
irrelevant,
if
you
said
it
has
to
be
stronger
in
that
case.
