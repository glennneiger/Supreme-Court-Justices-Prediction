justice
antonin
scalia
lex
luthor
might.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't...
you
don't
have
to
answer
all
of
these
things
for
your
case,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying
that
a
reasonable
person
couldn't
have
found
the
opposite.
you're
just
saying
that
a
reasonable
person
could
have
found
what
this
district
judge
found.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
don't
you
just
swallow
all
these
things
and
say,
yeah,
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
could
say
that,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
my
point
stands?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
looked
at
them.
it
didn't
necessarily
follow
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
white
collar
crime,
for
example,
it
went
vastly
higher
than
what
had
been
the
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
another
circuit
would
develop
the
opposite.
i
mean,
this
circuit
would
say
that
17
is
unreasonable.
the
other
circuit
would
say
that
19
is
unreasonable.
and
we
would
have
to
sort
out
all
those
things
ultimately,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
kind
of
a
sentencing
review
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
all
these
questions
only...
only
apply
to
departures
downward
from
the
guidelines,
and
if
you
ask
the
same
question
with
regard
to
departures
upward
you
do
run
into
constitutional
problems
when
the...
when
courts
of
appeals
begin
to
establish
certain
facts
that
have
to
be
found
in
order
to
move
upward
or...
yes,
certain
facts
that
justify
moving
upward.
so
you
end
up
with
a
quite
skewered
system
in
which
there
is...
there
is
vigorous
hearty
review
of
departures
downward,
but...
but
very,
very
slight
review
of
departures
upward.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
unreasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you're
saying
they
can't
disagree
with
the
policy.
they
can
only...
only
say
there
are
special
facts
in
this
case
that
were
not
taken
into
account
in
the
policy.
but
you're
saying
they
are
bound
by
the
policy
set
forth
in
the
guidelines.
that's
not
my
understanding
of
either
apprendi
or
booker.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
yes
and
which
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
relevant
to
the
case,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
rationally
grounded
in
the
case
before
them.
let's
take
the
question
of
whether
you
should
give
higher
sentences
for
crack
cocaine
than
for
powder
cocaine.
why
can't
the
district
court
simply
disagree
with
the
fact
that
the
guidelines
said
you
should
give
a
100
times
more
for
the
one
than
for
the
other?
why
can't
the
district
court
just
say,
that
seems
to
me
a
very
erroneous
judgment
by...
by
the
sentencing
commission?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
it
must
follow
the
guidelines,--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
just
has
to
consider
them.
it
did
consider
them
and
said:
i
disagree
with
that
judgment
of
the
guidelines.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
involves
cocaine.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if...
what
if
the
sentencing
judge
simply
disagrees
with
the
guidelines?
he
just
simply
disagrees
with
the
severity
of
the
sentence
that
the
guidelines
impose?
he's
free
to
do
that,
isn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
long
as
that
disagreement
is
reasonable,
so
long
as
another
sentencing
commission
might
indeed
have
imposed
a
lower
sentence...
for
antitrust
violations,
if
indeed
all
the
federal
courts
before...
before
the
guidelines
came
into
effect
were
rarely
imposing
any
prison
sentences,
how
could
you
say
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
a
district
judge
to
say,
i
simply
agrees
with
what
the
guidelines...
with
what
the
sentencing
commission
did,
and
i
agree
with
all
of
those
sentencing
courts
before
then,
which
thought...
which
thought
only
in
a
rare
case
should
there
be
jail
time?
how
could
you
possibly
say
that
that's
unreasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
also
made
it
very
clear
that
the
guidelines
are
advisory,
and
there
is...
there
is
no
way
to
a
maintain
that
with
the...
with
the
kind
of
approach
that
you're
offering.
they
aren't
advisory.
they're
pretty
much
mandatory.
you
depart
too
much
and
you'll
be
called
to
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot
disagree
on
policy
with
the
guidelines,
then,
at
least
not
fundamentally?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
that...
that
fits
in
with
your
prior
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then...
then
you're
just
blowing
smoke
when
you
say
that
the
guidelines
are
advisory.
what
you're
saying
is
the
criterion
for
fairness
is
the
guidelines
and
if
you
go
too
far
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
guidelines,
you're
not
being
fair.
that...
that's
not...
that's
not
advisory.
that's
the
guidelines
as
a
criterion
of
sentencing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
did
that
here.
he
said,
you
know,
i
think
a
young
person
like
this...
other
people
may
feel
differently,
but
i
think
somebody
at
21
really
is...
is
not...
his
brain
isn't
fully
formed
and
we
should
give
him
another
chance.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
probably
make
them
mandatory.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
trying
to
development
a
rule
here
that
can
be
applied
sensibly
by
all
the
courts
of
appeals
when
they
are
reviewing
the
innumerable
sentences
of
federal
district
judges.
and
you
have...
you
haven't
given
me
a
rule.
i
have
no
idea...
if
i
were
sitting
on
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
have
no
idea
when
i
can
do
it
and
when
i
can't
do
it.
the
notion
of
reasonableness,
you
know,
whether
a
reasonable
person
could
have
given
a
sentence
of
this
sort
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
not
what
the
sentencing
commission
did,
that's...
that's
something
you
can
work
with,
but
i
don't
understand
what
your
rule
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
say...
i
wouldn't
say
that.
there
are...
there
are
certain...
certain
limits
where
you
would...
the
example
you
gave
of
that
kind
of
an
acceleration
of
the
penalty,
and
i
can
see
giving
this
person
no
jail
time
whatever
would
be
extreme.
but
if
you
are
trying
to
get
a
narrow
range
of
sentences
out
of
the
guidelines,
it
seems
to
me
you're
just
working
in
opposition
to
what
our
opinions
have
said
which
is
that
the
guidelines
are
advisory.
and
they're
not
mandatory.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
you're...
you're
arguing
hereby
in
a
case
where
the
departure
was
downward,
but
you're...
the
principle
you
apply,
you
would
apply
for
upward
departures
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
there
get
to
be
a
constitutional
problem
where...
where
the
court
which
is
establishing
these...
these
ranges
that
you
want
has
held,
after
a
series
of
decisions,
that
basically
you
cannot
get
30
percent
over...
over
the
guideline
range
unless
particular
facts
exist?
and
it
has
specified
those...
those
facts
in
prior
decisions.
at
that
point,
in
order
to
go
30,
you
know,
30
percent
above
the
guidelines,
that
fact
becomes
necessary
for
the
conviction
and...
or
for
the
sentence,
and,
therefore,
you
would
need
the
jury
to
find
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
common
law
adjudication
always
amounts
to.
by
trial
and
error,
one
case,
the
next
case,
you
eventually
end
up
knowing
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
give
30...
30
percent
over.
unless
you're
accomplishing
that,
i
don't
know
what
you're
accomplishing.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
said
this
fact
is
okay.
you
can
go
30
percent
above
with
this
fact.
so
then
in
the
next
case,
the
district
judge
says,
i
find
that
this
fact
exists
and
therefore
you
get
30
percent
above
the
max,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirms,
but
the
jury
has
never
found
that
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
left
open...
it
left
open
case-by-case
adjudication.
it
left...
application
review.
and
i'm
saying
that
in
the
application
review
of
that
case,
you'd
have
to
say
you
needed
a
jury
finding.
