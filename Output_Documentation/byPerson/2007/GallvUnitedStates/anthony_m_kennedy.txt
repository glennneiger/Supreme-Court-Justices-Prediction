justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it
had
been
the
other
way
around
and
the
district
court
had
said
what
appellate
court
said
and
the
appellate
court
had
said
what
the
district
court
said,
what
would
you
be
arguing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
can
see
the
systemic
concern.
i
mean,
it's
just
not
always
going
to
be
the
case
that
the
district
judge
is
the
one
to
give
more
leniency.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
going
back
to
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
and
the
colloquy
you
had
with
him
with
the
hypothetical,
the
two
different
judges
in
the
statement
district
or
the
same
circuit
that
treat
age
differently,
if
the
congress
saw
that
would
the
congress
be
able
to
say
anything
about
that,
do
anything
about
that
to
stop
the
disparity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
consistently
with
the
sixth
amendment?
