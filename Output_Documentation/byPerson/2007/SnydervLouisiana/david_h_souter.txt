justice

h.

there...
there
isn't
much
reason,
is
there,
to
think
that
the
trial
court
was
being
very
critical
of
the
prosecutor's
answers?
my
recollection
is
that,
after
the
o.
j.
simpson
remark
had
been
made
in
final
argument,
that
the
ultimate
resolution
of
that
involved
the
trial
judge
saying
that
one
reason
that
was
not
a
racially
significant
remark
was
that
the
prosecutor
had
neither...
had
mentioned
neither
the
race
of
the
defendant
nor
the
race
of
o.
j.
simpson.
now
that
is
not
a
critical
mind
at
work,
is
it?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
and
because--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
because
you
suppose
not
and
i
certainly
suppose
not,
the...
the
fact
is
that
we
have
to...
we
have
to
consider
the
o.
j.
simpson
remark
in
trying
to
evaluate
what
went
on,
in
trying
to
evaluate,
for
example,
the
lack
of
critical
follow-up
in...
in
a
disparate
way
by
the
prosecutor.
and
that,
in
fact,
is
a
fair
and
potent
argument
that
the
other
side
has,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
believe
that,
if
there
had
been
a
white
defendant
here,
the
o.
j.
simpson
case
would
have
been
mentioned?
justice
david
h.
souter
see,
i'd
be
candid...
i
will
be
candid
to
say
to
you,
under
the...
under
the
circumstances
of
the
record
in
front
of
us,
i
find
that
highly
unlikely.
and
because
i
find
that
highly
unlikely,
i
put
significance
in
the
o.
j.
simpson
remark
which
even
you
concede
is
significant.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you...
do
you
believe
that
it
would
have
been
appropriate
at
that
point
for
the
prosecutor
to
invoke
in
his
argument
any
case
from
any
state
in
which
a
criminal
defendant
had
unsuccessfully
feigned
insanity
as
a
reason
to
decide...
for
the
jurors
to
decide
that
this
defendant
is...
is
feigning
insanity?
justice
david
h.
souter
brooks
says
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
wouldn't
take
it
at
face
value
if
there
had
been
a
further
question
asked
of
mr.
brooks
saying,
are
you
really
satisfied
you
have
nothing
to
worry
about?
and
he
says
well,
gee,
boy,
i
sure
hope
i...
i'm
able
to
make
that
requirement.
but
nobody
asked
that
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
we
have
is
got
is
"okay"
on
the
one
hand
and
"i
can
make
arrangements"
on
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
knew
nothing
about
that
juror
except
what
justice
stevens
and
you
have
just
been
reciting.
if
that's
all
you
knew
and
you
were
a
prosecutor,
would
you
have
struck
him?
would
you
have
said:
i
don't
want...
i
don't
want
anybody
on
this
jury
who's
got
friends
in
the
police
department?
would
you
have
struck
him
for
that
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you...
would
you
have
gotten
rid
of
him?
would
you
have
said:
i
don't
want
any
cop
lovers
on
my
jury?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you
wouldn't
have,
and
neither
would
i.
