mr.
bright,
may
i
ask,
in
your
judgment,
was
all
the
reference
to
o.
j.
simpson
relevant
at
all
to
what
is
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about
juror
hawkins.
you
haven't
talked
much
about
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
they
strike
him?
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
pretty
good
juror
for
the
prosecution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
he
struck
before
they
back-struck
the
first
black
on
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
probably
explains
why
they
didn't
make
a
batson
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
why
the
defense
would
have
struck
him.
i'm
trying
to
understand
why
the
prosecutor--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--my
problem...
after
the
back
strike
of
the
first
black
juror
who
had
been
accepted,
can
they
thereafter
renew
an
objection
if
the
jurors
two
and
three,
who
are
accepted
on
the
assumption
that
there
would
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
although
you
could
have
made
an
objection.
as
i
understand
your
opponent,
he
very
helpfully
said
that
they
probably
would
have
left
the
courthouse--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
what
could
you--
