chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-10119,
synder
v.
louisiana.
mr.
bright.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
right
that
you
zero
in
on
the
ones
as
to
which
you
objected.
but
you
also
want
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
these
other
jurors
were
excluded,
and
no
objection
was
made
to
their
exclusion.
if
an
objection
had
been
made,
the
state,
of
course,
would
have...
could
have
explained
if
they
had
a
reason,
a
non-racial
one,
why
they
were
struck.
but
you
didn't
object.
and
yet
you
want
them
to
be
considered
as
convincing
racial
bias.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
presumably
because
no
objection
was
raised
as
to
mr.
hawkins.
i
mean,
it
is...
the
burden
is
on
you
to
object
if
you
think
jurors
are
being
excluded
on
a
racial
basis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
out
of...
out
of
how
many
who
were
struck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
looking
at...
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
360.
as
i
read
it,
miss
scott
gives
an
answer
that
can't
be
heard,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
dupont
says,
"i'm
sorry,
i
can't
hear
you.
"
i
mean,
we
don't
know;
since
we
weren't
there
if
it
was
kind
of,
you
know,
"i
think
i
could"
and
then
"i
think"...
i
mean,
you
know,
it's
an
atmospheric
determination
by
the...
the
district
court
judge;
and
as...
as
has
been
pointed
out
here,
all
we
have
is
the
cold
transcript.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
on
joint
appendix
401?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and...
and
the
problem
with
that,
of
course,
is
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--367.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but...
the
question
is
not
could
you
consider
the
death
penalty.
it
says
could
you
consider
both,
when
they're
going
through
several
of
the
juries.
jurors.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
thought
that
was...
the
point
was
made
by
your
friend
on
the
other
side,
was
that
it
was
ambiguous
as
to
what
option
she
was
saying
she
could
consider.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--with
brooks,
what
he
said
when
he
said
i'm
missing
right
now
something
that
will
better
me
towards
my
teaching
career,
and
they
say...
and
the
judge
says,
is
there
anybody
who
could
speak
to
it?
and
he
says,
i've
already
talked
to
the
dean.
and
so
based
on
the
initial
conversation
with
the
dean
he
was
still
worried.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
the
judge
calls
the
dean,
and
of
course
the
dean's
going
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
what
he's
going
to
say
to
the
judge.
when
brooks
talked
to
him,
apparently
there
was
a
problem
because
his
concern
remained
after
having
talked
to
the
dean.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
says
i'm
missing
right
now--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--something
that
could
help
me
out
towards
my
teaching
career.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
your
answer
that
mr.
brooks
did
not
say
there
was
a
problem.
he
says,
i've
already
missed
half
a
day.
there's
something
i'm
missing
right
now
that
will
better
me
towards
my
teaching
career.
he
says
i've
already
talked
to
the
dean.
how
can
you
say
he
isn't
identifying
a
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
explanation
that
was
given
that
this
was
referring
to
the
defendant's
feigning
emotional
distress
rather
than
anything
to
do
with
race?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
relief
you
are
requesting
goes
only
to
the
penalty
and
not
to
the
conviction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though...
even
though
your
theory
is
that
it
was
only
with
respect
to
the
penalty
that
the
bias...
you
have
no
allegation--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
this
jury
did
not
return
a
valid
conviction.
i
thought
your
objection
was
with
respect
to
the
death
penalty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bright.
mr.
boudreaux.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
bright
contrasts
that
with
the
more
probing
inquiry
with
respect
to
white
jurors
who
said
"i
think
i
could",
and
here
there
was
no
follow-up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
boudreaux,
even
if...
even
if
you're
correct
that
a
neutral
explanation
was
given
focusing
on
the
emotional
distress,
are
you...
do
you
think
the
prosecutor
would
have
made
the
analogy
if
there
had
been
a
black
juror
on
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
still
have...
i
am
curious
to
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question.
when
they
go
back
and
back
strike
at
that
point
can
the
defendant
say
i
don't
think
you
can
back
strike
this
juror
you're
doing
it
on
the
basis
of
race.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
can
go
back
and
back
strike.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
can
go
back
and
object
to
the
back
striking?
the
state
would
say,
well
here's
the
reasons
we're
back
striking.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
there's
some
ambiguity
in
your
answer.
miller-el
says
others
who
were
struck
can
be
considered
as
part
of
the
totality.
my
question
is...
can
they
go
back
and
object
not
only
to
the
back
struck
juror,
but
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
to
the
others
who
weren't
objected
to
perhaps
because
there
wasn't
a
black
person
on
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
still,
the
prosecutor
is
still
there.
you
can
ask
the
prosecutor,
why
did
you
strike
that
juror?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
boudreaux.
mr.
bright,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
with
your
friend
on
the
other
side,
that
you
could
have
objected
both
to
the
backstruck
juror
and
to
the
jurors
to
whom
you...
with
respect
to
whom
you
did
not
object
because
there
was...
the
juror
that
was
later
backstruck
on
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
objection
would
have
afforded
the
state
an
opportunity
to
present
the...
if
there
was
one...
the
non-racial
reason
that
they
struck
the
juror.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bright.
the
case
is
submitted.
