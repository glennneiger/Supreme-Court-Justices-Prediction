mr.
stephen
b.
bright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
here
of
the
majority
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
on
remand
from
this
court
is
an
extraordinary
departure
from
the
lessons
that
this
court
taught
in
its
miller-el
decisions.
and
i
point
out
sort
of
three
overarching
errors
in
that
regard.
first,
the
majority
looked
at
each
of
the
miller-el
factors
or
some
of
them,
and
largely
discounted
them.
that
there
were
five
african-americans
struck,
they
whittled
that
down
to
two.
that
there
was
disparate
questioning,
they
identified
that
of
the
white
jurors
and
jeffrey
brooks,
but
they
said
that
counted
for
the
state.
and
miller-el
clearly
teaches
that
it
didn't.
they
found
there
was
no
racial
implication
in
the
mention
of
o.j.
simpson
case
from
the
start
of
the
case
all
the
way
through,
because
neither
o.j.
simpson's
race
nor
mr.
snyder's
race
was
mentioned.
secondly,
there
were
some
miller-el
factors
that
were
not
considered
at
all,
not
even
acknowledged.
for
example,
one
of
the
most
powerful
ones,
the
failure
to
ask
any
questions
of
jeffrey
brooks
or
elaine
scott.
there
are
very
ambiguous
general
reasons
for
striking
them.
they
asked
no
questions.
in
this
case,
you
could
ask
anybody
any
questions
you
wanted
as
a
lawyer.
and
then
thirdly,
when
they
got
to
the
point
of
considering
them
cumulatively,
they
had
now
whittled
them
down
to
where
there
was
very
little
to
consider.
and
our
position
is
that
what
justice
kimball
did,
the
author
of
the
original
decision,
who
wrote
the
dissenting
opinion,
one
of
the
two
dissents
here,
actually
did
what
this
court
remanded
this
case
to
do,
which
was
reconsideration
in
light
of
miller-el,
because
when
you
consider
all
those
factors
together,
nothing
answers
the
question
of
or
explains
them
as
well
as
race.
you
can
pick
each
piece
out,
each
leaf
out
and
you
can
try
to
find
an
innocent
explanation
for
it.
but
when
you
stand
back
and
look
at
it
all
together...
and
that's
why
the
court
missed
the
fact
that
the
back
strike
was
racially
motivated
in
this
case.
it
just
simply
didn't
look
at
these
things
in
the
context--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--sure.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
i
see.
you
mean
the
jurors
happen
to
be
lawyers
and
they
are
struck?
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
there's
a
common
reason.
well,
if
that's
the
case
and
you
have
considered
that
in
miller-el,
that's
a
factor
for
race
neutrality.
the
difference
here
is
the
reason
given
for
striking
brooks,
for
example,
is
he
might
have
a
reason
to
go
home--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
no
different
than
miller-el.
the
court
in
miller-el
says
you
look
at
the
prima
facie
case
because
it
is
unlikely
to
happen
by
chance.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
the
difference
is
that
as
in
miller-el
it
is
unlikely
to
happen
by
happenstance.
they
struck
all
the
blacks
they
could
in
this
case.
there
were
only
five.
they
struck
every
one
of
them.
and
the
way
they
went
about
striking
them...
and
the
context
of
all
this...
it
doesn't
say
that
all
five
of
those,
that's...
justice
alito,
but
that's
the
classic
batson
case
where
the
prima
facie
case
is
strong,
given
the
number
of
people
struck,
but
you
zero
in
on
the
particular
jurors
where
doing
the
side
by
side
comparison,
the
failure
to
ask
any
questions,
the
other
factors
that
were
identified--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
part
of
the
reason
they
weren't
struck,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
one
of
the
elements
of
race
here.
the
prosecution
accepted
the
first
black
juror.
so
when
the
second
one,
gregory
scott
is
struck,
there's
only
one
out
of
two.
there's
no
the
pattern.
then
mr.
hawkins
is
struck.
now
it's
two
out
of
three.
it
is
when
miss
elaine
scott
was
struck.
and
now
it's
three
out
of
four.
there's
still
one
african-american.
at
that
point
defense
counsel
said
there's
a
pattern,
and
i
strike
based
on
the
pattern
of
striking
african-americans.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
or
actually
the
first
and
second.
you're
right.
the
second
and
third.
there
was...
that
certainly
could
have
been
done.
i
think
basically
the
defense
was
snookered
here.
but
also,
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
prosecution
from
giving
reasons.
in
fact,
mr.
oland,
the
junior
prosecutor
here,
he
starts
to
say,
i
struck
mr.
hawkins,
and
at
that
point
williams,
the
senior
prosecutor,
said,
don't
say
anything.
stop--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
but
the
only
thing
we're
putting
the
pattern
forward
for
is
step
three
of
batson,
where
both
miller-el
decisions
make
it
quite
clear
that
if
the
numbers
are
such
that
it
is
unlikely
to
happen
by
happenstance,
that's
one
element.
it
is
not
that
all
five
necessarily
were
struck
on
the
basis
of
race.
but
it
is
the
fact
that
that
unlikely
event,
that
five
out
of
five
were
struck,
informs
that
decision
in
batson
saying
looking
at
all
relevant
facts,
it
doesn't
exclude...
i've
seen
batson
challenges
where
a
lawyer
will
say,
well,
with
regards
to
five
and
six,
then
we
think
those
are
particularly
strong,
not
with
regards
to
others...
miller-el
did
that.
they
only
challenged
seven
on
direct
appeal,
only
challenged
six
on
the
habeas
corpus
case
that
ultimately
made
its
way
to
this
court,
and
this
court
only
found
with
regard
to
two.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
ten.
so
they
only
challenged
seven
of
those
on...
on
direct
appeal,
six
on
habeas
corpus,
and
this
court
only
found
jurors
fields
and
juror
ward.
that's
basically...
we're
here
saying,
you
struck
five
out
of
five,
all
that
he
possibly
could
have,
and
juror
brooks...
if
you
look
at
all
the
miller-el
factors
with
regard
to
jeffrey
brooks,
just
two
general
reasons
that
probably
applied
to
everybody
there.
he
was
nervous;
i
expect
every
citizen
called
out
of
their
home
or
out
of
their
work--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
that
was
with
regard
to
ms.
scott.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
justice
scalia,
there...
only
one
juror
here
was
ambivalent
about
the
death
penalty,
said
she
wasn't
sure.
she's
cross-examined
for
four
or
five
pages
of
transcript.
23...
21,
i'm
sorry...
jurors
are
asked
if
they
are
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
and
answer
the
question
yes.
21.
every
single
one
is
asked
at
least
two
and
some
were
asked
more
questions.
the
only
person
not
asked
any
questions
was
elaine
scott.
she
first
says,
could
you
impose
the
death
penalty?
"i
think
i
could".
then
she
says
later,
"i
could".
if
you
look
at
the
three
jurors
right
before
her,
mr.
boyd,
ms.
sara
coney,
mr.
salita,
"i
could
consider
it",
miss
scott,
"i
could".
they
all
give
the
same
answer.
two
of
those
people,
justice
scalia,
end
up
on
the
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
right.
the
first
time.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
then,
just
a
couple
of
pages
later,
mr.
chief
justice,
she
says
i
could.
she
gives
the
same
answer
that
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
i'm
sorry.
367.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
she
says
361.
and
then
just
a
few
pages
later
they
go
each
juror,
and
she
says
"i
could".
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
i'd
invite
the
court
to
look
at
that.
because
what
that
starts
out
with
is
a
question
about
life.
could
you
consider
life
imprisonment.
and
then
when
ms.
goff
is
answered,
she
says
the
death
penalty,
could
i
consider
it?
yes,
i
could
consider
it.
and
then
everybody
says
they
could
consider
it.
now,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
treated
this
as
her
saying
i
could
consider
the
death
penalty.
that's
what
they
said.
but
here's
the
other
point
with
miss
scott.
it
only
took
one
question:
ms.
scott,
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
i
think
you
could?
i
mean
that
was
in
miller-el...
in
the
opinion
in
miller-el
ii,
the
fact
that
fields
wasn't
asked
any
questions
about
the
position
on
the
death
penalty.
he
had
expressed
some;
but
if
the
prosecutor--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--but
justice
scalia,
there's
no
reason
you
wouldn't
ask
them
what
they
meant.
and
that's
what
the
prosecutors
did
with
all
the
white
jurors
here...
every
single
one.
it's
only
ms.
scott,
elaine
scott
that
there's
no
questions
asked
about
the
reasons
they
gave
for
striking
her.
so
they
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
her
what
she
meant
and
they
asked
all
21
of
the
white
jurors.
they
asked
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--no.
all
21
said
no.
and
then
the
prosecution
asked
them
follow-up
questions
about
what
their
beliefs
were.
so
in
those
situations,
the
prosecutor
is
asking
questions
to
be
sure
to
clarify
their
position
on
the
death
penalty.
miss
calligan
is
the
only
one
who
says
well,
i'm
not
sure.
so
they
asked
ms.
calligan
a
number
of
questions.
how
long
have
you
thought
about
it?
what
do
you
think?
all
those
sorts
of
things.
ultimately
it
is
pretty
clear
ms.
calligan
is
opposed
to
the
death
penalty.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
i
think
miller-el,
again,
answers
that,
because
the
entire
voir
dire
was
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
on
remand
from
this
court
arguments
were
made
about
the...
the
disparate
questioning
of
jurors;
and
also
with
jeffrey
brooks,
where
that's
also
very
clear
because
the
reason
given
for
striking
jeffrey
brooks
is
that
he
would
have
a
reason
to
want
to
go
home
early.
my
experience
is
most
jurors
taken
out
of
their
homes
and
out
of
their
work,
would
like
to
finish
their
job
and
go
home
early.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
right.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
not
mr.
laws
specifically,
but
you
can
look
at
the
other
people
that
are
mentioned
in
justice
kimball's
dissent.
mr.
yeager
had
something
coming
out
on
sunday;
he
wanted
to
get
home
for
that.
brandon
burns--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--actually
the
reason
they
say
they're
concerned
about
mr.
brooks
is
because
he
was
told,
your
dean
says
it
won't
be
a
problem.
and
he
says
okay.
no
further
expression
of
worry
by
him.
there
is,
by
the
other
jurors,
that
were
accepted...
they
all
say
on
the
record
i
need
to
get
back
to
my
job,
to
my
family.
mr.
burns...
a
single
parent,
teenagers,
89-year-old
grandparents
that
he
wants
to
get
back
to.
all
of
those
people
accepted
by
the
state.
and
justice
kimball
deals
with
some
of
those
in
her
dissenting
opinions,
and
they're
briefed
up
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
on
remand
from
this
case.
but
i
believe
miller-el
iii...
or
ii--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
he's
the
dean.
[laughter]
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
no,
this
was
in
august.
this
was
right
before
the
labor
day
weekend
in
august.
the
term
went
all
the
way
to
december,
justice
scalia.
and
he,
at
this
point...
brooks...
was
just
observing
someone
else
teach.
i
mean,
he
wasn't
teaching
himself.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
again,
it
would
have
only
taken
one
question.
one
question...
mr.
books,
now
that
you've
heard
that
your
dean
said
it
won't
be
a
problem,
do
you
have
further
concerns
about
wanting
to
get
home
quickly?
mr.
brooks--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--if--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--if
i
could
answer
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
you're
the
lawyer
standing
there
beside
him
and
he
says
what
you
just
said,
then
you
ask
him
one
question.
but
there's
a
professor,
sanders;
he's
not
watching
class;
he's
teaching
class
at
the
start
of
a
semester
at
the
university
of
new
orleans;
and
he
doesn't...
it
is
no
speculation.
with
brooks
it's
all
speculation.
with
sanders--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--no
problem.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
brooks
doesn't
say
there's
a
problem.
he
gives
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--something
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--sure.
every...
the
judge
had
given
this
hardship
question;
we're
going
to
sequester
the
jury,
you're
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
communicate
with
anybody.
you're
going
to
have
to
stay
out
at
the
travelodge
while
this
case
is
going
on.
of
course,
he
doesn't
say
at
that
point
how
long
it's
going
to
be.
and
44
people
come
forward.
but
all...
with
most
of
those
people,
like
with
brandon
burns,
who
has
got
to
get
back
to
his
landscaping
business,
mr.
laws
who's
has
to
get
back
two
homes
he's
building;
his
wife
is
recovering
from
surgery
and
taking
his
children
to
school
every
day...
all
those
people
are
assured
this
case
is
going
to
be
over
by
saturday;
it's
not
going
to
go
very
long.
this
argument
that
they
were
worried
that
the
jury
might
be
out
for
a
long
time.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
he...
he's
saying,
again,
not
knowing
how
long
this
is
going
to
last,
or
what's
going
to
be
expected
of
him...
right
now
i'm
missing
something
to
help
my
education.
everybody
is
missing
something
that's
going
to
help
them
in
their
job,
with
their
families,
or
whatever.
but
once
the
judge
calls
him
back
up
to
the
bench
and
says,
we've
talked
to
the
dean.
he
said
it
is
not
going
to
be
a
problem
for
you
to
be
here,
most
students
i
know...
and
i
know
a
lot
of
you
have
had
experience
with
students...
once
they're
assured
by
the
dean
that
it's
not
going
to
be
a
problem,
it's
not
going
to
be
a
problem.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
i
think
when
the
judge--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--the
judge
of
the
court,
the
presiding
judicial
officer
there,
says
we've
talked
to
your
dean,
and
it's
not
going
to
be
a
problem
for
you
to
be
here
this
week.
and
everybody
is
told
this
week
we're
going
to
try
this
case.
this
is
a
labor
day
weekend
coming
up.
we
know
you
will
send
the
jury
out
on
friday
afternoon.
you're
not
going
to
wait
too
long
for
that
verdict
probably.
and
everybody
is
told...
you're
going
to
be
out
of
here
by
saturday.
mr.
yeager,
you're
going
to
be
out
of
here
by
sunday.
so
we're
talking
really
about
mr.
brooks
missing
three
more
days.
this
is
on
tuesday.
this
case
is
over
on
friday.
and
everybody
knew
it
was
going
to
be
over
on
friday,
because
they
told
jurors
over
and
over
and
over
again
that
it
was
going
to
be
over
by
friday,
so...
or
saturday
at
the
latest.
so
i...
i
would
say,
again,
no
questions
asked.
the
lawyers
had
an
opportunity
right
there
when
they
told
him
the
dean
says
it's
not
a
problem.
then
later
he's
called
in
panel
1.
you
can
ask...
you
see
this
voir
dire.
it
is
very
interesting.
it
is
very
short,
but
the
lawyers
could
ask
individual
questions
to
any
juror
out
there
on
the
panel.
mr.
brooks,
do
you
have
any
concern
that
you
won't
be
able
to
concentrate
because
you
need
to
get
back
to
school?
they
asked
that
question
over
and
over,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
of
white
jurors.
in
fact,
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
in
what
i
think
is
one
of
its
great
legal
errors--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
not
only
at
those
answers
but...
but
what
the
court
in
miller-el
ii
said
were
the
side-by-side
comparisons.
if
you're
asking
the
white
jurors
follow-up
questions
to
determine
that,
then
that,
i
think,
cuts
very
much
against
the
prosecution
and
supports
an
inference
of
racial
discrimination.
if
you
basically
asked
everybody
about
the
same
thing,
you
can't
draw
that
inference.
but
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
here
there
was
consistent
questioning
of
the
jurors
about
whether
whatever
their
other
obligations
were,
it
would
interfere
with
their
ability
to
sit
as
jurors.
there
is
consistent
questioning
of
everybody
except
jeffrey
brooks.
and
that's
the
one
african-american
who
the
court...
who
the
prosecutors
then
say
they're
striking
for
that
reason.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
i...
i
think
the
judge
was
present,
but
he
was
quite
passive.
one
of
the
more
remarkable
aspects
of
this
jury
selection
is
when
he
grants
a
defense
strike
for
cause,
the
prosecutor,
mr.
williams,
says...
are
you
crazy?
and
the
judge
says:
no.
and
they
go
right
on
to
the
next
fact.
you
know,
i...
i
practiced
law
for
30
years.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
it
wasn't
the
right
question.
i've
often
wondered
about
that,
but
i've
never
articulated
it.
[laughter]
and
i
think
most
lawyers
wouldn't.
there's
another
point
where
williams
tells
the
judge:
swear
all
these
people
to
say
they've
got
a
valid
reason
for
leaving,
and
send
them
all
out
of
here...
swearing
people
to
say
something
that
may
be
true
or
may
not
be
true.
and
the
judge
says:
well,
do
i
do
it
individually,
or
do
i
do
it
in
a
group?
he
says:
do
it
in
a
group.
just
have
them
all
swear
that
they've
got
a
legal
reason,
a
hardship
reason,
to
be
excused.
and
the
judge
goes
right
along
with
it.
i
think
what
we
see
with
the
judge
in
every
ruling
here
is
four
or
five
words:
i'm
going
to
allow
it.
i'm
going
to
allow
it.
the
judge
is
not
engaged
in
questioning.
unlike
uttecht
v.
brown
that
justice
kennedy
wrote
about
last
term
where
you
have
a
judge
involved
and
hearing
the
lawyers
and
whatever,
that's
not
present
here.
so
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
that
factor,
you
don't
have
assurance
that
this
judge
was
involved
in
a
way
to
make
sure
that
the
credibility
determinations
which
were
being
made...
and
the
other
point
i
would
make
is
here
he's
ruling
on
the
batson
strikes
as
the
jury
is
being
selected.
so
he
doesn't
have
all
of
the
information.
now,
he
does
rule
again
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
that's
the
only
time
that
all
of
the
information,
all
of
the
relevant
information,
is
before
the
judge.
but,
there
again,
all
he
says
is
i
think
the
prosecutor's
reasons
were
race-neutral.
there
is
no
indication
that
he
went
beyond
that
to
consider
what
batson
said
and
what
miller-el
says
we
have
to
consider,
which
is
all
the
relevant
factors.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
i
think
it
is,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think,
even
if
you
don't
look
at
the
closing
argument,
which
tells
you
two
important
things...
first
of
all,
the
prosecutor
broke
his
promise
to
the
judge
that
he
wouldn't
mention
it.
he
said
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
will
not
mention
it.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
it
has
to
do
with--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--it
has
to
do
with
his
credibility,
which
is
very
much
what
batson
is
about.
but...
but
to
the
o.
j.
simpson
case,
i
think
the
prosecutor's
obsession
with
o.
j.
simpson...
a
month
before
he
mentions
it
in
a
pretrial
hearing.
the
defense
moves
to
ask
to
quit
referring
to
the
o.
j.
simpson
case
in
the
media;
and,
for
goodness
sakes,
judge,
don't
let
him
refer
to
it
before
the
jury.
and
the...
the
defense
makes
quite
clear:
the
polls
show
that
the
society
is
divided.
this
was
ten
months
ago
that
simpson
came
down.
it
is
a
very
polarizing
case.
the
fact
that
he
is
mentioning
it
is
going
to
inject
racial
prejudice
into
this
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
i
think,
chief
justice
roberts,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
mr.
snyder
was,
in
fact,
suicidal
is
not
rebutted
in
any
way
by
bringing
in
the
most
racially
polarizing
case
in
the
country
and
saying
that
simpson
was
trying
to
get
away
with
it.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
similarities.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
well...
and
he
said
simpson
got
away
with
it.
snyder
couldn't
have
possibly
known
that,
because
the
verdict
in
simpson
didn't
come
down
until
after
snyder's
crime
had
been
committed.
so
he
couldn't
have
been
imitating,
if
that
is
what
he
was
arguing...
he
couldn't
have
been
imitating
o.
j.
simpson.
i...
i
think
what
this
prosecutor
learned
from
o.j.
simpson,
justice
stevens,
is
that
you
don't
let
blacks
on
the
jury.
i
mean
i
think
he
saw
that
this
racially
mixed
jury
in
los
angeles
let
him...
quote...
"get
away
with
it",
and
we're
going
to
have
an
all-white
jury
here
in
jefferson
parish,
louisiana.
and
unlike
what
happened
out
there,
we're
not
going
to
let...
of
course,
this
was
at
the
penalty
phase.
he
could
only
get
life
without
parole
or
the
death
penalty.
he
wasn't
going
to
get
away
with
anything.
but
that
was
the
way
it
was
pictured
to
the
jury:
that
if
they
didn't
give
him
the
death
penalty,
he
would
get
away
with
it.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
no,
chief
justice
roberts.
this
was
in
striking
the
jury,
and
there's
no
prejudice
requirement
with
race.
allen
snyder
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
with
a
fair
jury
that
represents
the
community.
so
i
think
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--oh,
no.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
no.
let
me...
let
me
make
this
quite
clear.
our
objection
is
that
when
the
jury
was
selected,
in
terms
of
the
disparate
questioning,
disparate
acceptance,
failure
to
ask
any
questions,
racial
prejudice
infected
the
selection
of
the
jury.
all
the
o.
j.
simpson
case
does
is
put
a
little
icing
on
the
cake.
but
if
you
look
at
the
miller-el
factors
and
you
consider
them
cumulatively,
like
justice
kimball
did
in
her
dissent,
you
come
away
once
again
with
what
the
court
said
in
miller-el.
the
evidence
is
too
powerful.
it
all
points
in
one
direction,
and
that's
intentional
race
discrimination.
and
that
was
in
the
jury.
and
if
that
happened,
allen
snyder
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
if
i
could,
i'd
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
could
just
say,
first
of
all
about,
this
backstrike,
because
what
we
see
here
is
after
elaine
scott
is
struck,
that's
state
number
6,
the
very
next
peremptory
strike
by
the
state
it,
number
7,
is
to
go
back
and
backstrike
jeffrey
brooks.
now,
notice
that
with
regard
to
the
other
four
backstrikes
used,
two
by
the
prosecution
and
two
by
the
defense,
it's
at
the
very
end
of
the
process.
it's
literally
when
they're
down
to
one
juror.
williams
says,
11
jurors>
["]?
and
then
he
backstrikes.
the
defense
says,
11th
strike>
["]?
backstrike.
williams
then,
11>
["]?
so
these...
the
only
way
the
backstrike
makes
sense
really,
when
you
think
about
it,
is
to
look
at
the
whole
jury
and
then
go
back
and
cull
out
the
ones
based
on
a
comparison.
but
once
brooks
had
kept
them
from
striking
mr.
scott,
who
as
mr.
boudreaux
pointed
out,
his
wife
was
robbed
at
gunpoint,
said
he
would
testify
if
he
were
a
defendant
in
a
case
and
was
innocent.
and
then
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
hawkins,
who
was...
had
grown
children,
engineer,
friends
in
the
police
department...
these
two
are
not
struck...
but
then
once
elaine
scott
is
struck,
the
third
back
and
the
batson
challenge
is
made,
we
don't
have
any
use
for
jeffrey
brooks
anymore,
so
he's...
the
backstrike
is
used
in
that
way.
and
i
think,
again,
when
you
look
at
all
the
relevant
circumstances,
it's
pretty
clear
what
was
going
on
here
with
the
acceptance
of
brooks
at
the
start
and
the
backstrike--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--i...
i
think
yes.
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
and
i
think,
if
the
defense
had,
we'd
be
talking
about
four
jurors
here
today
instead
of
two.
but
it
doesn't
diminish
from
what
the
court
in
miller-el
called
the
numbers.
the
fact
that
it
is
unlikely
to
be,
by
chance,
that
all
five...
all
five
african-americans
are
struck
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
they
would.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
so
they're
gone.
and
so
if
the
objection
had
been
overruled--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--but
the
reason
for
doing
that
would
be
to
have
the
judge
not
allow
the
strike
and
to
put
that
juror
in
the
box
and
the
juror'
gone
now.
so
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
not
going
to
work.
there's
no--
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
--but
there's
no
procedural
rule
in
louisiana
that
says
you
have
to
do
that.
it
might
have
been
a
stronger
case
if
they
had
done
it.
mr.
stephen
b.
bright
if
i
may
answer.
that
only
goes,
though...
the
only
two
jurors
on
the
reasons
that
are
before
the
court
are
jeffrey
brooks
and
elaine
scott.
but
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
struck
all
five,
and
as
justice
souter
points
out,
you
wouldn't
have
made
this
argument,
i
don't
think...
this
o.j.
simpson
argument...
not
only
depending
upon
the
race
of
the
defendant,
but
if
there
had
been
black
people
on
that
jury.
this
is
an
argument
that
resonates
with
an
all-white
jury.
thank
you.
