justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
couldn't
counsel
at
that
point
have
gone
back
and
said,
ah,
now
i
see
what's
going
on,
so
i'm
going
to
challenge...
i'm
going
to
interpose
a
batson
challenge
with
respect
to
the
second
and
third
african-american?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bright,
the
judge
was
quite
passive,
and
was...
was
the
judge,
in
fact,
present
throughout
the
entire
voir
dire?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
laws
was
an
identical...
he
came
up
too.
he
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before...
before
the
rebuttal,
this
prosecutor
was
going
around
advertising
this
as
his
o.
j.
simpson
case,
and
the
defense
attorney
said
please,
judge,
get
him
to
stop
saying
that.
this
is
long
before...
you
are
painting
a
picture
of
someone
who
was
answering
an
argument
made
by
the
defense,
but
this
prosecutor
initiated
it,
and
the
defense
attorney
was
reacting.
she
said
judge,
he's
talking
in
this
county,
that
county
about
this
is
his
o.
j.
case;
stop
him
from
doing
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
he
says
i'm
an
officer
of
the
court,
and
i'm
giving
you
my
word.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
"okay"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
says
i
can
make
arrangements,
and
the
other
is
more
economical
and
he
says
"okay".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--meaning
brooks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
difference
is
between
"i
can
make
arrangements"
and
"okay".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
wasn't
done
here.
that
was
the
point
that
you
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
the
third...
the
back
strike
of
brooks
was
made,
they
could
have
gone
back
for
hawkins
and
the
others,
but
they
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
boudreaux,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
before
you
finish.
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
but
we
are
told
that
african-americans
are
20
percent
of
the
population
of
jefferson
parish,
but
they
were
less
than
11
percent
of
the
people
summoned
for
jury
duty.
is
that
typical?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's...
and
because
it's
almost
half
of
what
you
would
expect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
