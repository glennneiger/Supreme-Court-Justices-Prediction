mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
had
some
prepared
remarks
to
begin
with,
but
i
think
i'd
like
to
go
straight
into
responding
to
some
of
the
concerns
that
have
just
been
raised.
first
of
all,
concerning
elaine
scott,
the
lady
who
said
"i
think
i
could".
i
think
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
she
was
being
asked
about
considering
life
imprisonment.
beginning
at
364
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
question
is
asked
by
the
prosecutor
four
times:
"could
you
consider
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment?
"
"could
you
consider
the
possibility
of
life
imprisonment?
"
"could
you
consider
life
imprisonment"?
"it
is
whether
you
could
consider
life
imprisonment.
"
you
get
to
ms.
scott,
the
answer
is
"i
could".
she's
the
lady
who
said
originally,
"i
think
i
could".
so
the
prosecutor's--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--as
to
life
imprisonment,
your
honor.
as
to
death,
she
said
"i
think
i
could".
when
it
got
to
life
imprisonment,
the
full
question
asked
four
times,
among
various...
going
down
the
list...
is
when
she
said--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--beginning
at
364
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
the
question
posed
is
regarding
life
imprisonment.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
she
was
originally
asked
the
question
about
the
death
penalty,
and
her
response
was
the
"i
think
i
could".
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
that's
true,
your
honor.
in...
in
reviewing
this
record,
there
are
instances
where...
where
there
were
not
a
lot
of
follow-up
questions.
we
see
the
situation
with
mr.
brooks.
this
jury,
unlike
the
jury
in
miller-el,
which
took
five
weeks,
this
jury
took
less
than
a
day
and
a
half
to
pick.
so
there
were
not
a
lot
of
probing
questions.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
yes,
sir.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
yes,
sir.
but
you
see--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--yes,
sir.
mr.
laws,
like
mr.
brooks,
i
think
it's
good
to
point
out,
approached
the
bench
of
his
own
volition.
other...
other
individuals
waited
until
they...
if
they
were
called
and
were
questioned.
the
way
the
proceedings
began,
when
the
venire
were
summoned
into
the
courtroom,
the
judge
introduced
the
staff,
read
the
statutory
requirements
for
jury
service,
and
then
they
started
lining
up.
and
one
of
the
people
lining
up
to
express
his
concern,
not
just
about
meeting
the
requirements
to
be
a
juror,
was
"i've
got
class,
i've
got.
"
--and
i
think
it's--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--he
did
come
up,
and
i
think
the
distinction
there,
your
honor,
is
that
like
several
of
others,
unlike
mr.
brooks,
in
the
end
he
said
"i
can
make
arrangements.
"
"i
can
deal
with
it.
"
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i'm
sorry.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
ms.
scott?
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i
don't--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--i
would
submit
that...
that
would
indicate
ambiguity,
your
honor,
that
the
prosecutor
starts
off
with
the
life
imprisonment
question,
and
then
it
sort
of
morphed
into
a
death
penalty.
but,
by
the
time
you
get
back
to
ms.
scott--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--yes,
your
honor.
what--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--one
of
the
weaknesses
in
some
these
jurors
is
a
lack
of
follow-up
questions.
but
i
think
we
go
back
to
her
original
comment,
which
was
so
softly
spoken
that
the
defense
attorney
said
"i
can't
hear
you".
there's
nothing--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--in
the
totality
of
her
responses,
the
ones
that
were
heard
which
are
on
the
record
and
the
ones
which
were
not
heard
which
are
not
on
the
record,
the
prosecutor
felt
that
she
was
weak
on
the
death
penalty.
and
that
on
its
face
is
a
race-neutral
reason.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
well,
i
would
just
say
that
the...
we're
talking
here
with
the
prosecutor's
perception
of
the
juror
based
on
her
answers
and
the
the
trial
court's
perception
in
evaluating
the
prosecutor's
proper
race-neutral
reasons.
could
someone
look
at
this
and
say
it's
to
the
contrary?
yes.
but
in
the...
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
the
reviewing
for
clear
error
with
the
benefit,
of
course,
that
the
trial
court
has
in
being
present,
hearing
or
not
hearing
what
was
said,
the
tone
of
voice,
the
demeanor,
the
mannerisms,
the
deference's--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--i
would...
i
would
suppose
not,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
the
objection
was--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
that
by
pointing
out,
though,
that
the
reference
to
the
o.
j.
simpson
case
was
based
on
the
factual
similarities
involving
the
o.
j.
simpson
case
and
this
case.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
if
the
o.j.
simpson
case--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the...
the
reason
it
doesn't
fatally
infect
the
proceedings
with
racism
is...
i
think
the
comment
would
have
been
made
had
o.
j.
simpson
not
been
white...
i
think
perhaps
the
comment
would
have
been
made
had
it
not
been
o.
j.
simpson
but
some
other
high-profile
white
athlete
celebrity;
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate,
putting
aside
for
the
moment
the
assurance
to
the
court
that
he
wouldn't
mention
it...
but
it
was
in
response
to
the
defense
counsel's
argument.
this
defendant
was
tried
on
a
plea
of
not
by
season
of
insanity.
the
murders
are
committed;
several
hours
later
he's
barricaded
in
his
house,
calls
the
police
claiming
to
be
suicidal;
the
police
respond.
he
gets
up,
unbarricades
the
door,
lets
the
police
in;
then
goes
back
into
his
fetal
position.
to
rebut
the...
this
perhaps
he's
thinking,
and
i
think
it
is
significant
in
defense
exhibit
2
at
trial,
what...
the
defendant's
statement
taken
several
hours
later,
he's
oriented;
he's
aware
of
the
situation;
he
knew
he
had
done
something
wrong,
was
in...
and
was
in
trouble.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i
think
he
would
have,
your
honor.
i
know
the
contention
is
that
he
didn't,
but
i
think
the
facts
are
clear
on
this
record
that
it
was
not
an
appeal
to
race,
but
it
was
an
appeal
to
what
was
a
historical
fact,
common
knowledge
among
most
people
in
the
country,
and
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
defendant's
statement
as
i
said
would
betray
no
mental
lack
of
wherewithal.
when
the
search
warrant
was
executed
his
bloody
shirt
was
found
in
the
attic
of
his
house.
that's
at
page
1311
of
the
record.
it
is
not
in
the...
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
but
when
the
defense
attorney
brings
up
the
police
coming
to
the
house
and...
and
he
agreed
that
the
police
officer's
testimony
was
correct,
he's
in
a
fetal
position;
he's
saying
they're
coming
to
get
me,
i'm
suicidal,
the
defense
attorney
is
bringing
up
the
mental
aspects
of
this
case.
so
i
think
it
was
appropriate
for
the
prosecutor
to
look
at
the
record
and...
and
to
rebut
that.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
that's
correct;
and
then
he
believes...
despite
his
assurances,
when
the
defense
attorneys
made
the
argument
they
made,
they
were
inviting
that...
that
response.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i
think
any
historical
fact
well
known
to
people
would
have
been
fair
game.
just
as
an
analogy,
remember
this
situation.
the
jury
is
instructed,
argument
of
counsel
is
not
evidence;
take
it
for
what
you
think
it's
worth.
this
was
the
historical
reference
this
prosecutor
used:
the
facts
are
similar.
contrast
that
with
the...
or...
kind
of,
almost
similar
to
that
when
we're
talking
about
racism
being
part
of
these
proceedings,
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
refers
to
david
duke.
if
your
honor
is
not
aware,
in
new
orleans,
louisiana,
for
a
number
of
years
david
duke
is
high
profile
ku
klux
klan.
in
some
of
the
voir
dire
in
this
case,
at
page
221,
222
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
is
defense
counsel
who
brings
up
david
duke.
now
you
understand
if
david
duke
was
on
trial
here
today
and
we
had
a
photo
album
of
him
in
his
robes,
he
would
still
be
entitled
to
a
fair
trial.
so
she's
using--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--right.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
your
characterizations
are...
are
correct,
your
honor.
i
won't
dispute
the
factual
allegations,
but
the
key
thing
to
point
out
there
is
mr.
laws
said
he
could
make
arrangements.
it
is
difficult;
it's...
the
jury
duty
happens.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i'm
sorry?
[laughter]
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
but
that...
he
said...
i
think
that's
the
landscape
man,
he
said,
as
long
as
it
wasn't
a
prolonged...
as.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
oh,
the
dean--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--brooks
says--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--the
difference...
difference
there,
your
honor,
is
that
mr.
brooks
needs
to
make
these
classroom...
undergraduate
requirements
to
graduate.
there's
a
day
that's
going
to
come
when
he's
either
made
his
requirements
to
graduate,
or
he
has
not.
the
people
with
the
jobs,
the
contractors,
their
jobs
are
there
when
they
got...
when
they
got
out
of
court,
when
trial
was
over.
if
mr.
brooks
didn't
meet
his
requirements,
he
was
not
going
to
graduate.
and
i
would
be
a
little
careful
to
take
it
as
face
value
from
the
judge's
law
clerk
calling
the
dean
who
then...
she
comes
back
and
says
it
is
a
300-hour
observation.
that's
obviously
wrong.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
nobody
asked
that
question.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
we
also
have,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
question
of
mr.
brooks
is
concerned,
a
fact
that
is
not
articulated
by
the
prosecutor
but
which
would
be
supported
by
the
record.
he's
an
education
teacher;
he's
young;
prosecutors
in
a
death
penalty
case
i
think
would
shy
away
from
asking
or
leaving
on
a
jury
a
young
person.
a
teacher,
maybe
perhaps
more
sympathetic,
maybe
more
understanding...
nothing
wrong
with
that,
but
maybe
that's
not
who
a
prosecutors
seeking
a
death
penalty--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--that's
the
problem
with
this
record.
the
state
says--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--the
plausibility
of
the
prosecutor's
reasons
stand
or
fall
on
what
he
says.
the
other
things
perhaps
the
court
will
say
he
didn't
say
that;
we're
not
going
to
consider
them.
but
talking
about
a
fact...
factual
specific
inquiry
before
an
appellate
court,
that
brings
us
back
to
the...
to
the
discretion
afforded
the...
not
the
discretion,
your
honor,
the
deference
afforded
the
trial
court
who
is
present
for
the
proceedings,
who
is
there,
passive
or
otherwise.
he's
there.
he
sees
what's
going
on,
the
demeanor--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--hawkins?
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
your
honor,
that's
a
question
i've
asked
myself;
and
i
can't...
i'm
not...
you
would
think
on
the
surface
of
it
he
would
have
been
a
good
juror
for
the
state.
what
i
think
is
equally
clear
is
that
the
defense
would...
objected
to
his
being
excused
but
didn't
make
a
batson
claim
because
i
don't
think
they
wanted
to
go
there.
they
would
not
have
wanted
that
juror
on
their
jury.
he
said
he
had--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
yes,
you're
correct
about
that.
but
i
think
he
would
have
not...
the
jurors...
the
defense
perhaps
would
have
struck
him.
he
testified
that
he
had
plenty
friends
who
were
police
officers
in
this
jurisdiction.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
well,
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor,
because
there
was
no
batson
objection
raised,
and
the
prosecutor
was
not
called
upon
to
articulate
any
reasons.
on
the
face
of
it,
he
looks
like
he
could
be
a
good
juror.
but
that's
a
factual
matter
that
the
trial
prosecutor,
then
and
there,
made
that
decision.
and
i
think--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--well,
i
can
say,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
first
time
that's
happened
over
years
in
different...
different
trials
that
i've
reviewed.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i'm
sorry?
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
no,
your
honor.
i
would...
i
would--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--no,
sir.
and
that's
the
difficulty
that--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--right.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
and
no
reasons
were
offered.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i
would
disagree
they
would
not
have
a
batson
claim
to
make
when
the
first
black
is
struck
if
they
felt
there
was
evidence
of
that
one--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--no,
sir.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
that's
correct.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
that's
why
you
don't
have
to
wait
for
a
pattern.
let's
say
you
have
an
all
black
jury.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
they
can
go
back
and
back
strike,
but
the
defendant
could
say--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--yes,
sir.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
the
back
strike
is
when
is
the
challenge
exercised.
in
and
of
itself
you
can't
say
if
it
is
racial
or
not.
it
is
a
challenge.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i
think
under
miller-el
and
related
decisions
that
would
be
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
practical
problem--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--yes.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
that
could
have
been
argued
evidence
for
them
to
make
their
prima
facie
case.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
to
give
you
a
yes
or
no
answer,
yes.
the
practical
problem
with
that
is
those
two
jurors
having
previously
been
excused,
could
be
on
the
way
to
their
office
or
back
to
their
home.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
yes,
you
could.
then
you
have
got
a
practical
problem
what
if
it
doesn't
pass
muster.
that's
the
reason
for
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i
wrote
the
brief,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think...
i
don't
remember.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i
don't
remember.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
you
know
to
be
honest,
justice
scalia's
comment
about
looking
at
the
record
and
saying
oh,
here
is
another
reason
that
the
prosecutor
didn't
articulate.
similarly,
your
honor,
in
reference
to
the
thomas
hawkins
being
struck
with
no
objections...
there
was...
greg
scott
was
a
black
juror
of
peremptory
struck
by
the
state.
again
with
no
objection.
if
you
want
to
talk
about...
if
we're
talking
about
two
or
five
here,
little
weight
should
be
given
to
the
exercise
of
those
two.
greg
scott...
again
like
the
other
juror,
i
don't
think
was
going
to
survive
the
challenge
by
the
defense.
his
wife
was
the
victim
of
a
carjacking,
and
he
said
if
he
was
a
defendant
and
he
was
innocent,
he
would
testify.
he
would
need
to
testify.
and
in
this
case,
the
defendant
did
not
testify
at
either
phase
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
certainly
pre-katrina,
your
honor.
yes.
the
summons
go
out
based
on
public
records,
driver
licenses,
voters
registrations.
that's
basically
at
random.
to
say
those
numbers
would
not
surprise
me.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
yes,
and
that's
going
to
vary,
you
know,
from
venire
to
venire
on
any
given
day.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
in
the
minute
or
two
i
have
left,
your
honors,
i
would
just
remind
the
court,
urge
the
court
to
consider
its
recent
opinion
last
june
in
uttecht
dealing
with
the
deference
due
the
trial
court
in
these
types
of
proceedings...
that
was
a
habeas
case...
what
the
opinion
says
to
require
on
direct
review,
and
according
to
the
trial
court,
the
deference
having
been
present
and
not
just
relying
on
a
cold
record,
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court's
ruling
should
be
farmered.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
yes,
sir.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
whether
it's
going
to
the
issue--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--yes.
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
right,
and
it--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--no.
because
you're
still
dealing
with--
mr.
terry
m.
boudreaux
--of
a
factfinder.
obviously,
there's
some
differences
in
uttecht
being
habeas
and
witherspoon,
but
the
similarities,
i
think,
are
enough
that
this...
the
degree
of
deference
has
to
still
be
there,
although
there's
a
statutory
deference
in
a
habeas.
thank
you.
