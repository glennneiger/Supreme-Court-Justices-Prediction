justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back
to
ms.
scott?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
go
back
to
ms.
scott?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
if
you
look
at
the
top
of
367
and
then
you
look
over
at
366,
the
format,
i
think,
is
that
the
prosecutor
is
posing
a
general
question.
and
then
he
poses
his
question...
or
she...
and
goes
around
and
gets
an
answer.
here
is
mr.
lindey.
so
they
start
out
with
the
death
penalty.
they
have
some
ambiguous
thing
at
the
bottom
of
366.
then
the
prosecutor
says,
"mrs.
alvarez...
ms.
alvarez,
you
said
you
could
not
impose
the
death
penalty.
"
"mrs.
goff...
ms.
goff:
i
could
consider
the
death
penalty.
"
"ms.
dupont:
i
couldn't
hear.
"
"prosecutor:
you
could
consider
both?
"
"yes,
i
would
consider
it.
"
"ms.
dubois:
i
could
consider
it.
"
"yes.
"
"ms.
archonie:
i
could
consider
it.
"
"mrs.
alvino:
i
could
consider
it.
"
"ms.
scott:
i
could.
"
"i
could.
"
now,
that
doesn't
seem
too
ambiguous
for
me...
to
me.
it
seems
that
what
they're
talking
about,
each
of
them,
is
the
death
penalty
because
that's
what,
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
top
of
367,
they
were
talking
about.
maybe
there's
ambiguity
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
haven't
noticed
in
anybody's
opinion,
so
far,
making
that
point
that
you
just
made.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no...
well,
there's...
i
just
read
you
what
it
was,
so
i
guess
people
make
up
their
own
mind
about
that.
but
by...
what
i
don't
think
you
can
make
up
your
own
mind
as
ambiguous
is
when
this
prosecutor
met
with
an
answer
that
he
considered
not...
call
it
strictly
kosher,
when
he
found
that,
like
mrs.
calligan,
she
said,
"i'm
not
sure".
that's
more
ambiguous
than
mrs.
scott.
and
then
he
goes
on,
for
three
pages
of
additional
questioning,
and
then
26
pages
later,
he
doesn't
excuse
her
yet
and
he
doesn't
excuse
her
until
she
volunteers,
"i
could
give
a
verdict...
i
don't
think
i
could
give
a
verdict
to
take
someone's
life.
"
and
it's
at
that
point
that
the
prosecutor
excuses
her.
now,
compare
that
to
ms.
scott,
who
started
out
saying
"i
think
i
could"
and
then,
as
i
read
it,
said
"i
could".
now,
that's
the
kind
of
comparison
here.
no
follow-up.
at
the
worst,
minor
ambiguity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
slight
hesitation.
now,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that,
of
course,
is
a
problem
i
have
generally
in
this
area.
we
can
always
imagine
that
things
that
are
not
in
the
transcript,
perhaps
what
she
said
spokenly
not
in
the
transcript
is
"i
hate
the
death
penalty.
"
"i'll
never...
i'll
never
apply
it
under
any
circumstances.
"
and
i
grant
you,
if
that's
the
law,
we
are
never
going
to
find
that
there's
any
prejudice.
but
i
just
don't
see
how
that
could
be
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course...
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
he's
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
without
prejudice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
think
you
have
two
instances
here.
one
is
mrs.
scott,
and
the
other
is
mr.
brooks.
and
with
regard
to
mr.
brooks,
what
i've
read
in
the
transcript
is
that
he
was
nervous
and
unhappy,
because
he's
learning
to
be
a
teacher,
and
he's
afraid
he's
going
to
miss
some
student
teaching
time
which
will
count
against
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
says
is
the
clerk
called
the
dean
and
the
dean
said
it
he
won't,
don't
worry
about
it,
which
mr.
brook
is
then
told.
he's
challenged
for
that
reason.
he
might
still
worry
about
it.
but
mr.
laws
is
not.
and
mr.
laws
is
a
self-employed
contractor
who
announced
to
the
court,
i
have
a
big
problem
this
weekend;
two
houses
are
near
completion,
the
owners
are
supposed
to
be
moving
in;
my
wife
has
just
had
a
hysterectomy,
she's
supposed
to
be
taking
care
of
the
children
back
home,
and
i...
she
has
nobody
to
help.
okay?
he's
not
challenged.
so
we're
not
worried
about
mr.
laws
worried
about
his
wife
and
his
business
which
going
down...
you
know,
serious.
but
we
are
worried
about
mr.
brooks,
who
has
been
told
by
the
dean
you
have
no
problem.
now,
that's
a
little
bit
of
a
problem
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
add
them
up,
we
have
ms.
scott
we
have
mr.
brooks,
we
have
the
mention
of...
and
three
others...
three
others,
the
only
other
three
black
people
are
challenged
off,
and
we
have
the...
no
black
juror
us
on
and
we
have
the
references
to
o.
j.
simpson
beside.
okay?
all
right
so,
there
you
are.
full
case
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
she
means
the
dean.
the
dean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--said
no
problem
at
all.
what
better
arrangement
can
you
want?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this
at
all
but
how
this
is
supposed
to
work?
a
defense
attorneys...
the
jury
selection,
and
he
sees
that
the
prosecutor
doesn't
challenge
for
peremptory
or
any
other
reason
one
black
member.
let's
call
it
five.
and
then
they
start
challenging
black
members.
obviously,
he
didn't
at
the
beginning
impose
any
batson
claim.
he
had
no
batson
claim.
there
were
five
people
on
the
jury
who
were
black.
what
claim
could
you
make?
and
then
after
you
begin
to
get
suspicious
and
start
to
make
them,
now
they
do
this
thing
called
black
strike
and
they
get
everybody
off
the
jury.
how
is
it
supposed
to
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
speaking
reality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
you
are
the
only
one
who
will
know
the
answer
to,
this
too.
i
noticed
in
looking
at
the
opinion
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
that
they
start
out
by
saying
we
have
conducted
another
review
of
the
voir
dire
transcript
and
find
nothing
there
to
disparage
the
batson
claim.
in
reading
that
opinion
in
several
places
they
refer
to
their
having
gone
back
and
having
read
the
whole
transcript
themselves.
and
then
they
have
two
full
pages,
or
one
and
a
half
anyway
where
they
seem
to
be
talking
about
what
happened
in
a
pretrial
conference
and
they
refer
to
that
prior
review
and
covered
a
factor
favorable
to
the
state's
use
of
a
peremptory
challenge.
they
went
back
and
found
a
factor
of
favorable
to.
now,
was
that
factor
argued
to
them
in
the
brief?
do
you
remember
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that's
why
you
might
know.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that,
in
reading
it,
it
seems
as
if
they
are
not,
and
i
was
thinking
about
how
a
judge
can't
think
of
everything.
but
if
they're
going
to
think
beyond
what
the
briefs
tell
them,
they
ought
to
think
of
it
for
both
sides,
and
not
just
for
one
side.
