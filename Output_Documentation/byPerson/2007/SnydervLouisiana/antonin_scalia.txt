justice
antonin
scalia
the
district
judge
is
in
a
much
better
position
to
decide
those
matters,
such
as
you
know,
he...
his...
his
response
was...
was
slow
on...
one
the
question
of,
you
know,
whether
he
could
consider
the
death
penalty.
i
can't
tell
that
from
a
cold
record,
and
that's
why
we...
rely
upon
the
trial
judge.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
these
are
peremptory
challenges.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
one...
one
juror
who
says
i
think
i
could
and
another
one
who
said
i
could,
i'm
going
to
strike
the
one
who
said
i
think
i
could.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
all
21
say
i
think
i
could?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
the
dean
could
resolve
his
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
man's
problem,
what
he's
worried
about
is
that
he
has
to
put
in
a
certain
number
of
hours
of
teaching.
and
what
was
it?
a
couple
of
months
before
the
end
of
the
term?
it
was
going
to
be
very--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever.
he
had
to
be
there
to
observe.
he
had
to
put
in
a
certain
number
of
hours.
how
could
the
dean
say
oh,
don't
worry,
it's
no
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
hours
requirement
is
a
requirement
for
the
degree.
i
don't
think
deans
have
the
ability
to...
to
waive
degree
requirements.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
dean
was
just
saying
oh,
he'll
be
able
to
do
it,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
wouldn't
inspire
a
great
deal
of
confidence
in
me,
even
if
i
said
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
reaction
would
be...
would
depend
on
how
he
said
okay.
and
if
i
were
sitting
there
as
the
trial
judge,
i...
i
could
discern
whether
okay
meant
well,
you
know,
that's
what
he
says
but
i'm
still
going
to
have
a
hard
time
digging
out
those
hours
for
the
remaining
time
that
i
have
in
the
term.
i
don't
know
how
he
said
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
assurance
is
only
secondhand,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
dean
says
it's
okay,
that's
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
like
the
right
answer
to
me.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
broke
his
promise.
i
mean
sue
him
or
something,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
a
fair
jury
was...
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
not
just
racially
polarizing.
i
mean
maybe
it
is
that,
but
it
is
also
a
case
in
which
a
man
killed
his
wife
with
a
knife.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
as
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
feigned
a
mental
illness
by
his...
his
great-escape
escapade,
and
that
is...
that
is
what
the
prosecutor
said
he
was
trying
to
bring
before
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
to
life
imprisonment
or
as
to
the
death
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
this?
i...
364?
show
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we...
we
have
to
go...
your...
this
is
enough
of
a
fact-specific
inquiry
for
any
appellate
court,
even
when
we
go
into
the
allegations
that
the
prosecution
did
make.
now
you're
saying
we
also
have
to
imagine
other
reasons,
which
he
didn't
state
were
the
reasons
why
he
struck,
but
which
might
have
been.
you
really
think
that
that's
enough
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is
not
the
problem
with
it.
it
is
your
problem
with
the
record.
[laughter]
it
is
not
mine.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
rule
is
not
that
you
can't...
so
long
as
you
have
some
black
on
the
jury,
you
can
strike
the
rest.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
single
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
another
reason
to
do
it
would
be
to
preserve
your
right
on
appeal,
to
object
to
those
jurors.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
your
rule
here
that...
that
we're
not
going
to
postulate
the
worst
reason
for
a
prosecutorial
strike
rather
than
a
good
reason
when
you
haven't
given
the
prosecution
an
opportunity
to
set
forth
a
good
reason.
