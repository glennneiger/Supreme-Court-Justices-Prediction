justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
about
one
of
the
factors?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
hard
to
discuss
them
all
at
the
same
time.
what
is
the
relevance
of
strikes
of
black
lawyers
that
you
don't
argue
were
based
on
race?
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
why
that's
relevant
in
this
calculation.
suppose
there's
a
case
where
it's
perfectly
clear
that
certain
strikes
were
not
racially
motivated.
let's
say
the
prosecution
has
the
strategy
of
striking
every
lawyer
who's
on
the
panel.
it
strikes
every
white
lawyer
and
it
strikes
every
black
lawyer.
then
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
fact
that
the
black
lawyers
were
peremptorily
challenged?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
are
making
the
argument
there
were
five
african-american
jurors
who
were
the
subject
of
prosecutorial
peremptory
challenges.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and...
but
you
don't
claim
that
three
of
those
strikes
were
based
on
race?
do
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
were
a
large
number
of
strikes
in
miller-el.
this
is
a
much
smaller
number.
could
you
just
explain,
if
you
can,
what
is
the
relevance
of
strikes
that
you
do
not
even
claim
were
racially
motivated?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
bright,
you
make
good
arguments
about
comparisons
between
white
jurors
and
black
jurors.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
we
do
with
the
comparisons
that
you
are
making
now
to
white
jurors
who
were
never
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
you
have
a
good
argument
in
comparing
him
to
some
of
the
white
jurors,
in
particular
mr.
laws.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
my
understanding
is
you
never
relied
on
mr.
laws
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
arguments
as
to
each
of
them
are
different.
the
argument
as
to
mr.
yeager,
i
think
is
much
weaker.
he
had
one
event
on
a
sunday
and
he
was
told
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
that,
this
case
is
going
to
be
over
by
sunday.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
that's
quite
different
from
somebody...
it
could
be
quite
different
from
someone
like
mr.
brooks
or
mr.
laws.
isn't
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
you
are
trying
this
case.
you
are
a
defense
attorney,
and
you
ask
a
juror,
a
potential
juror:
would
you
hold
it
against
a
defendant
who
doesn't
take
the
stand?
and
the
initial
answer
is:
i
have
to
think
about
that.
i'm
not
quite
sure.
now...
and
then
you
go
on,
and
you
ask
a
lot
of
questions,
and
the
juror
comes
around
to
saying:
i
understand
that's
a
person's
constitutional
right.
they
get
the...
advice
from
a
lawyer.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
the
person
has
something
to
hide,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
does
that
additional
questioning
allay
the
concern
that
you
would
have
had
at
the
beginning
about
the
fairness,
the
potential
fairness,
of
the
juror?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
explanation
for
mr.
brooks
is
not
terribly
convincing
on
its
face.
this
is...
was
an
incredibly
short
trial,
was
it
not?
mr.
brooks
is
voir
dired
on
tuesday.
and
there's
a
death
verdict
on
friday.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
concern...
the
major
concern
about
him
is
that
he's
going
to
worry
about
missing
wednesday,
thursday,
friday
student
teaching?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
compare
him
to
some
of
the
white
jurors,
particularly,
i
think,
mr.
laws.
mr.
laws
seemed
to
have
a
more
compelling
reason
to
be
worried
about
not
being...
about
being
in
court.
he
was
a
contractor.
he
had
houses
he
had
to
finish.
his
wife
had
recently
had
surgery.
he
was
taking
kids
back
and
forth
to
the
school.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
have
no
idea...
we
have
no
idea
what
this
man
looked
like.
we
have
no
idea
about
his
demeanor,
his
tone
of
voice.
this
could
have
been...
there
could
have
been
very
legitimate
reasons
for
doing
it.
there
could
be
no
legitimate
reasons
for
doing
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
nobody
asked
what
reason
for
doing
it
was.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
petitioner
allen
snyder
was
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
in
a
louisiana
court
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
rejected
petitioner's
claim
that
the
prosecution
exercised
some
of
its
peremptory
strikes
based
on
race
in
violation
of
batson
versus
kentucky
because
we
find
that
the
trial
court
committed
clear
error
in
overruling
a
batson
objection
to
the
strike
of
juror
jeffrey
brooks,
we
reverse.
batson
provides
a
three-step
process
for
trial
court
to
use
in
deciding
a
claim
regarding
a
peremptory
challenge
that
is
alleged
to
have
been
based
on
race.
this
case
concerns
the
third
step
of
that
process
at
which
the
trial
court
must
determine
whether
the
objecting
party
had
shown
intentional
discrimination
because
the
third
step
often
involves
credibility,
determinations
and
firsthand
observations
that
are
peculiarly
within
the
trial
court's
province,
the
trial
court's
ruling
should
be
disturbed
only
when
there
is
clear
error.
the
prosecution
gave
two
reasons
for
striking
mr.
brooks,
a
college
senior.
first,
that
mr.
brooks
looked
nervous
during
voir
dire.
and
second,
that
mr.
brooks
expressed
the
concern
that
service
on
the
jury
would
conflict
with
his
student
teaching
obligations.
the
trial
court
did
not
explain
the
basis
for
overruling
the
batson
objection
and
we
therefore
cannot
presume
that
the
trial
judge
made
a
finding
on
mr.
brooks'
demeanor.
indeed,
the
prosecution
struck
mr.
brooks
a
day
after
he
was
questioned
during
voir
dire.
the
judge
may
not
have
even
remembered
mr.
brooks'
demeanor
at
that
point
or
may
have
found
it
unnecessary
to
consider
his
demeanor
basing
his
ruling
on
the
second
proffered
justification
alone.
the
second
justification
fails
even
the
deferential
standard
of
review
applicable
here.
when
mr.
brooks
came
forward
to
express
concern
that
jury
service
would
conflict
with
his
student
teaching
obligations,
the
court
called
the
dean
at
mr.
brooks'
college.
the
dean
said
that
there
would
not
be
a
problem
if
mr.
brooks
missed
one
week
of
student
teaching.
during
voir
dire,
the
prosecutor
stated
that
he
did
not
think
that
the
trial
would
last
through
the
weekend,
and
it
did
not.
if
mr.
brooks
had
served
on
the
jury,
he
would
have
missed
only
two
additional
days
of
student
teaching.
the
implausibility
of
this
explanation
is
reinforced
by
the
prosecutor's
acceptance
of
white
jurors
who
disclosed
conflicting
obligations
that
appeared
to
have
been
at
least
as
serious
as
mr.
brooks'.
the
pretextual
explanation
of
the
strike
of
mr.
brooks
naturally
gives
rise
to
an
inference
of
discriminatory
intent.
in
other
context,
we
have
held
that
once
it
is
shown
that
a
discriminatory
intent
was
a
substantial
or
motivating
factor
in
an
action
taken
by
a
state
actor,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
state
to
show
that
the
factor
was
not
determinative.
assuming
that
the
standard
applies
in
the
batson
context,
we
conclude
that
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
prosecution
would
have
challenged
mr.
brooks
based
on
his
alleged
nervousness
alone.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
