justice

so
if
you
had
a
statute...
a
state
like,
i'm
told,
vermont,
that
doesn't
take
away
any
one's
civil
rights,
not
even
a
first
degree
murderer's,
then
that
first
degree
murderer
would
be
equated
to
someone
whose
civil
rights
were
taken
away
and
then
restored.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
not
anomalies
because
the
gun
prohibition
would
cover
them,
even
though
they
never
had
their
civil
rights
taken
away?
is
that...
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then,
maybe
the
problem
was
that
congress
included
misdemeanants
who
were
subject
to
over
a
two-year
sentence.
the
point
has
been
made
that,
on
your
reading,
that
was
a
futile
gesture,
or
congress
did
one
thing
that
was
cancelled
out
by
someone
else,
by
another
provision.
and
then
they
put
in
this
group
of
misdemeanants
who
were
subject
to
an
over-two-year
sentence;
but
most
of
that
group...
and
in
many
states
all
of
them...
would
not
have
their
civil
rights
taken
away.
so
what
is
left
of
the
group
that
was
put
in,
misdemeanants
with
over-two-year
sentences?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
point
of
putting
that
group
in
the
statute
as
covered
by
the
career
criminal
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
many
would
be...
take
a
state
that
doesn't
take
civil
rights
away
and
gun
rights
from
misdemeanants.
what
effect
in
that
state
would
this
legislation
have...
what
effect
would
the
provision
of
this
legislation...
that
says
misdemeanants
who
are
subject
to
a
two-year...
over-two-year
term
are
covered?
it
wouldn't
be
covered
because
the...
because
they're
not
having
their
civil
rights
taken
away.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
everyone
in
this
case.
the
point
might
be
arguable
in
a
case
that
involved
that
domestic
violence
statute.
this
case
doesn't
involve
that
other
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
cases
in
the
pipeline
that
don't
think
it's
as
clear
as
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
decide
in
this
case
the
meaning
of
the
words
“civil
rights
restored”
contained
in
a
provision
on
sentencing
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
or
acca.
ordinarily,
felons
who
possess
firearms
are
subject
to
a
maximum
sentence
of
10
years,
but
acca
increases
the
maximum
to
life
and
the
minimum
to
15
years
for
felons
who
have
three
prior
convictions
for
violent
felonies.
congress
defined
violent
felonies
to
include
violent
misdemeanors
punishable
under
state
law
by
more
than
two
years
in
prison.
pivotal
here,
congress
exempted
from
classification
as
violent
felonies,
cases
in
which
the
offender
has
had
his
civil
rights
restored.
petitioner
james
logan
pleaded
guilty
to
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
he
was
sentenced
to
acca's
mandatory
minimum
of
15
years.
his
acca
enhanced
sentence
rested
on
three
prior
convictions
in
wisconsin.
each
was
for
misdemeanor
battery,
a
crime
punishable
by
more
than
two
years
imprisonment
but
causing
no
loss
of
civil
rights.
challenging
his
enhanced
sentence,
logan
argued
that
convictions
carrying
no
loss
of
civil
rights
are
functionally
equivalent
to
convictions
for
which
rights
are
loss
but
later
regained.
the
district
court
upheld
the
sentence.
one
cannot
have
civil
rights
restored,
the
court
said,
unless
they
were
earlier
withdrawn.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
as
we
do
in
turn.
congress,
we
hold,
did
not
include
offenders
who
retained
civil
rights
at
all
times,
in
its
dispensation
for
offenders
whose
civil
rights
have
been
restored.
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
“restored”
is
to
give
back
something
that
has
been
taken
away.
indicating
that
congress
intended
restore
to
have
its
ordinary
meaning,
the
words
“civil
rights
restored”
appear
in
the
statute's
text
together
with
other
acts
of
official
forgiveness,
expungements,
set
asides
and
pardons.
the
offender
who
retains
rights
all
along
however
gets
post
conviction
no
official
token
of
forgiveness.
literal
interpretation,
logan
objects
ought
not
to
control
when
it
yields
absurd
results.
in
some
states,
logan
points
out,
misdemeanants
retain
civil
rights
while
felons
lose,
but
then
automatically
regain
rights
on
release
from
prison.
what
sense
does
it
makes
he
asked
to
expose
lesser
offenders,
misdemeanants
to
heighten
punishment
while
more
serious
offenders
who
got
back
civil
rights
automatically
may
escape
acca's
reach?
the
anomaly
is
less
glaring
then
logan
suggest,
an
offender
whose
civil
rights
have
been
restored
will
gain
no
exemption
from
acca
if
the
state
explicitly
prohibits
him
from
possessing
firearms,
a
ban
many
states
impose.
such
a
felon
has
no
advantage
over
a
misdemeanant
who
never
lost
his
civil
rights.
logan's
reading
also
creates
anomalies.
well,
we
too
accept
his
interpretation
that
in
a
state
that
does
not
revoke
any
offender’s
civil
rights,
even
a
murder
conviction
could
gain
exemption
from
acca.
although
congress
explicitly
placed
state
misdemeanors
within
acca's
ambit,
logan's
interpretation,
we
emphasize
would
effectively
place
them
beyond
acca's
reach
for
misdemeanants
generally
retain
their
civil
rights.
we
are
disinclined
to
say
that
what
congress
imposed
with
one
hand,
it
withdrew
with
the
other.
moreover,
even
if
we
were
convinced
that
logan
was
exposed
to
acca
because
of
a
congressional
oversight
or
mistake,
we
have
no
means
or
authority
or
determine
which
of
several
solutions
congress
might
adopt.
the
distinction
between
rights
retained
and
rights
restored,
we
note
finally,
may
not
have
been
inadvertent.
in
a
provision
modelled
almost
word
for
word
on
acca
but
relating
to
domestic
violence,
congress
explicitly
excluded
from
civil
rights
restored,
convictions
for
which
civil
right
were
never
taken
away.
given
the
resemblance
between
the
two
statutes,
it
is
surely
reasonable
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
civil
rights
restored
to
convey
the
same
meaning
in
both
provisions.
in
prescribing
sentences
under
acca,
congress
chose
to
incorporate
state
law
classifications
and
definitions.
the
diversity
of
those
laws
made
sentencing
disparities
inevitable.
recognizing
that
reality,
we
hold
that
the
word
“civil
rights
restored”
in
the
provision
under
inspection
mean
just
that
and
do
not
encompass
civil
rights
retained.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
