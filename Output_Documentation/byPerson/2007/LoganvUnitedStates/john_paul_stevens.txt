at
any
time
in
consideration
of
these
statutes
did
congress
consider,
to
your
knowledge,
perhaps
making
the
test
be
the
length
of
the
actual
sentence
served
rather
than
eligibility
for...
it
seems
to
me
one
normal
way
of
differentiating
between
those
who
are
most
trustworthy
and
those
less
trustworthy
would
be
by
looking
at
the
actual
sentence
served.
