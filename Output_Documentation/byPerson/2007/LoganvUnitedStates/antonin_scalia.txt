mr.
coad,
how
are...
how
are
civil
rights
which
have
been
taken
away
typically
restored?
what
is...
what
is
the
process
for
restoring
them?
just
if
you
don't
commit
another
offense
within
a
certain
number
of
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you
can
say,
however,
that...
that
in
the
restoring
situation,
there
is
at
least
a
greater
individuation
of
the...
of
the
state's
determination
of
the...
the
trustworthiness
of
the
individual
to
be...
to
be
trusted
with
arms.
that
is
to
say
well,
this
person
has
not
committed
an
offense
within
so
many
years.
or
maybe
in
some
states,
it
may
be
an
individual
determination.
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question.
is
it
ever
one
by
one,
you
apply
to
have
them
restored?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that's...
that's
a
totally
different
thing
from
just
a
gross
determination
by
a
state
that
everybody
who
commits
this
crime
does
not
lose...
does
not
lose
firearm
rights.
i
think
it's...
it's...
there's
a
greater
degree
of
assurance
when
you're
dealing
with
those
states
that...
that
have
some
degree
of
individuation.
at
least
this
is
an
individual
who
hasn't
committed
an
offense
for
so
many
years.
or
in
those
states
where
you
have
to
apply
personally,
i
think
they're
different
situations.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
a
misdemeanor?
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
about
that?
(33)
applies
to
a
number
of
different
crimes,
it
seems
to
me,
within
every
state.
are
you
sure
that
in
none
of
those
crimes
the
civil
rights
are
not
taken
away
for
some
of
them,
but
are
taken
away
for
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
it
make
much
sense,
as...
as
justice
ginsburg
suggests,
to
read
(a)(20)(b)
as
covering
almost
nothing?
i
mean,
you
know,
why
go
to
the
trouble
of
putting
in
that
provision
if
it's
only
going
to
make
a
difference
in
those...
in
those
very
few
states
where...
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
we
rewrite
statutes
like
that?
because,
gee,
look
at
this
statute.
congress
didn't
think
about
this,
and
it
makes
a
really
bad
result
here.
so
we're
going
to
add
this...
this
new...
i
don't
think
that
that's
how
we
operate.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
that
absurd
if
congress
did
the
same
thing
in
(a)(33).
justice
antonin
scalia
what
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
court
of
appeals
was
that?
i
didn't
get
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
murderers,
i
assume?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that's--
