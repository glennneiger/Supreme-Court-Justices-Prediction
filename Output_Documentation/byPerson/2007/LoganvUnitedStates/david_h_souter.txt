mr.
coad,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
involves
the
comparison
of
what,
for
shorthand
purposes
i'll
call
subsection
(20)
and
subsection
(33).
i
take
it,
it
is
your
position
that...
and
(20)
applies
here.
but
i
take
it
that
it's
your
position
that
under
(33),
your
argument
could
not
prevail
because
the
language
of
(33)
makes
it
clear
that
there's
got
to
be
a...
in
effect,
a
revocation
of
the
right
first,
before
there
can
be
a
restoration
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute?
you
accept
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
now
that
applies
as
i
recall
to
cases,
or
primarily
to
cases,
in
which
there
has
been
a
misdemeanor
conviction
for
domestic
violence,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
if
your
position
prevails,
then
subsection
(20),
which
applies
to
more
serious
offenses,
would
in
effect
be
held
to
provide
for
a
restoration
when,
in
fact,
nothing
had
been
taken
away.
whereas
under
(33),
which
applies
simply
to
a
relatively
minor
set
of
crimes
in
relation
to
(20),
would
not
provide
this
relief.
so
you
would
have
the
anomaly
that
in
the
more
serious
cases,
you
would
win.
in
the
less
serious
cases,
you
would
lose,
because
the
statute
was
more
onerous.
that's
anomalous.
and
my
point
is,
and
this
is
what
i
want
you
to
comment
on,
i'll
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
you're
pointing
out
an
anomaly
here
if
you
just
look
at
(20)
alone.
but
if
you
look
at
(20)
and
(33),
by
going
your
way,
we're
going
to
create
another
anomaly,
the
other
anomaly
being
that
the
more
serious
offense
or
the
more
serious
offender
gets
better
treatment
than
the
less
serious
offender.
so
either
way
we
go,
there's
going
to
be
some
anomaly.
am
i
right
in
reading
it
that
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
none
of
them
is
less
serious
in
the
classification
of
the
crime
than
those
covered
by
33,
because
33
simply
covers
a
misdemeanor
of
domestic
violence.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
state's
judgment
about
trustworthiness
may
very
well
be
the
same
in
each
case.
so
the
trustworthiness
criterion,
it
seems
to
me,
is
being...
would
be
applied
differently
in
the
two
cases
if
we
take
your
position.
