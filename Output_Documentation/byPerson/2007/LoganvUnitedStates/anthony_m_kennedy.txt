m.
kennedy
well,
but
even...
even
there
i
assume
the
law
waits
for
a
certain
passage
of
time,
and
i
would
assume
that
there
can
be
no
felony
committed
during
that
interim
period
or
the
person's
sentence
has
to
be
served
or
something?
it's
ongoing,
it's
prospective.
and
so
restoration
has
a
real
component,
in
that...
that
is
not
present
in
the
statute
that
we're
faced
with
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
is
of...
maybe
no
difference
if
the
operation
of
law
is
24
hours
later.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
assume
that's
not
the
case.
i
assume
that
there's
in
every
case,
as
justice
scalia's
question
indicates,
a
certain
passage
of
time
that
takes
place.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i'm
suggesting...
and
i
haven't
done
the
research...
that
that's
atypical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it's
atypical
to
give
a
felon
one
day
in
jail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know,
since
you
seem
to
have
looked
at
it:
in
north
carolina,
for
the
person
whose
had
his
civil
rights
taken
away,
is...
is
there
any
mechanism
to
get
them
back
earlier
by...
by
applying
for
clemency
or
a
pardon
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
would
be
about
the
only
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
the
automatic
category,
i
take
it,
it's
usually
after
the
sentence
has
been
served?
