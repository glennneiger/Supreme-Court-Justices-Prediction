chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-6911,
logan
v.
united
states.
mr.
coad.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that...
i
understand
that
it
is
rare
for
misdemeanants
to
lose
their
civil
rights.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
certainly
the
minority
approach.
in
most
states
if
you
are
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
you
do
not
lose
civil
rights?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
argument,
if
accepted,
would
essentially
weed
out,
or
at
least
for
a
majority
of
the
states,
weed
out
subdivision
(a)(20)(a)(b)...
(a)(20)(b)?
in
other
words,
there's
coverage
under
the
statute
if
you
are
convicted
under
a
misdemeanor
and
you
want
to
say,
well,
if
your
civil
rights
were
never
taken
away,
you
shouldn't
be
covered.
well,
that
would
mean
most
misdemeanors
aren't
going
to
be
covered.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
i
say
most
misdemeanors
aren't
going
to
be
covered,
it's
not
an
answer
to
say,
well,
here's
one
state
where
they
are
covered.
it's
maybe
49
are
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
there
another
difficulty
for
you
in
this
statutory
comparison
that
justice
souter
has
noted?
you're
argument
under
(a)(20)
is
that
it
would
be
absurd
for
congress
to
take
people,
exempt
people,
whose
rights
have
been
restored,
but
not
people
whose
rights
were
never
taken
away.
that
is
exactly
what
congress
did
in
(a)(33).
so
if
congress
thought
it
was
all
right
even
in
albeit
in
a
different
context,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
difficult
to
argue
that
it
is
inherently
absurd
to
do
it
somewhere
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
phrased
congress's
intent
as
allowing
an
exemption
for
people
the
state
has
found
trustworthy.
but
i
don't
think
that's
how
this
legislative
process
works.
you
have
additional
punishment,
and
then
somebody
says:
oh,
let's
not
apply
it
to
people
who
are
convicted
of
antitrust
violations.
and
you
say:
yeah,
yeah.
and
then
somebody
says:
let's
not
apply
it
to
people
whose
civil
rights
have
been
restored.
and
they
say:
fine.
and
then
nobody
pipes
up
and
says:
well,
let's
not
apply
it
to
people
whose
civil
rights
were
never
taken
away.
in
other
words,
it's
not
an
intent
that
is
not
effectuated.
it
is
just
you
want
the
intent
to
reach
more
broadly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
based
on
a
congressional
mistake,
in
other
words,
about
the
breadth,
but
it
still
doesn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about
securities
law
violations?
(a)(20)(a)
says
this
doesn't
apply
if
it's
an
antitrust
violation.
now,
did
congress...
you
could
say:
well,
they
would
have
applied
it
to
securities
law
violations,
too.
it's
a
business
offense.
they're
not
interested
in
that.
so
we
should
read
this
as
applying
to
securities
law
violations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
kind
of
begs
the
question
for
you
to
say
congress
is
worried
about
offenders
states
think
are
trustworthy.
what
they
actually
said
are,
of
course,
offenders
who
have
had
their
civil
rights
restored.
maybe
if
they
focused
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
civil
rights
were
taken
away
in
the
first
place,
they
would
have
made
a
different
judgment,
as
they
did,
of
course,
in
(a)(33).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't...
under
our
precedents,
isn't
what
you
just
said
fatal
to
your
case:
in
other
words,
congress
didn't
think
about
this,
or
they
made
a
mistake
in
thinking
about
it?
in
either
case
it's
clear
that
they
didn't
legislate
with
respect
to
it.

justice

g.
roberts,
jr.
