mr.
richard
a.
coad
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
provision
at
issue
determines
which
convictions
constitute
a
prior
felony
for
imposition
of
the
federal
firearms
ban
and
its
increased
penalties.
its
exemption
clause
prescribes
certain
ways
in
which
a
conviction
that
otherwise
meets
that
definition
is
nevertheless
exempt.
specifically,
it
looks
to
a
state's
indication
that
an
offense
is
deprived
of
any
continuing
effect,
such
as
whether
the
status
of
an
offender's
civil
rights
are
the
same
after
a
conviction
as
they
were
before
conviction.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
statute
should
be
read
to
exempt
convictions
for
which
civil
rights
were
lost
and
later
regained
while
at
the
same
time
not
exempting
a
conviction
for
which
civil
rights
were
never
lost,
even
though
both...
in
the
end,
both
offenders
have
their
civil
rights
following
their
conviction.
congress's
underlying
objective
in
drafting
the
exemption
clause
was
to
ensure
that
federal
law
respected
a
state's
considered
judgment
that
a
particular
offense
should
not
subject
a
person
to
the
federal
firearms
law.
the
seventh
circuit's
interpretation,
which
counted
convictions
for
which
rights
were
never
lost,
fails
to
respect
that
judgment.
it
disregards
the
state's
unequivocal
indication
to
the
federal
statute
that
an
offender
is
worthy
of
fully
participating
in
civic
life.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
the
government
points
to
maine
as
an
example
where
no
offenders
lose
their
civil
rights,
but
felons
lose
their
gun
rights
and
certain
misdemeanants
also
lose
their
gun
rights,
but
get
that
gun
right
back.
and
in
states
like
maine
and
in
vermont,
the
"unless"
clause
still
applies
and
still
precludes
those
types
of
convictions.
so
i
think
when
the
government
alleges
that
there
are
certain
anomalies
that
arise
from
our
interpretation,
it
is
simply
not
the
case,
and
if
they
are
anomalies
that
arise
from
our
interpretation--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--correct.
we
have
to
read
the...
both
clauses,
the
exemption
clause
and
the
unless
cause.
and--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--it
depends
on
the
state.
in
the
nacdl
lodging
that
the
court
has...
i
believe
29
states
were
identified
as
having
some
type
of
restoration
procedures.
the
majority
of
those,
it
is
by
automatic
operation
of
law.
so
there's
no
subsequent
conditions
met
by
the
offender.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
well,
i
think
that
there
really
isn't
a
difference
between...
by
operation
of
law,
a
state
taking
away
someone's
rights
and
giving
it
back
or
allowing
a
offender
to
retain
civil
rights--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--it
could
be
a
matter--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--it
could
be
as
short
as
24
hours.
in
certain
states
if
a
probationer
is
convicted,
rights
aren't
taken
away.
but
if
a
felony
offender
is
sentenced
to
even
one
day
in
jail
those
rights
are
in
theory
taken
away
for
that
one
day
and
restored
to
that
offender
the
minute
he
walks
out
of
jail.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
in
a
minority
of
states,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
i...
i
don't
think
they
are,
your
honor.
as
i
just
mentioned
there
are
states
in
which
a
day
in
jail,
your
rights
are
lost
and
restored.
and
there
really
isn't
any
difference
between
a
broad
legislative
determination
by
a
state--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--no,
it's
not
atypical.
in
18
out
of
the
29
states
identified
in
the
nacdl
lodging,
rights
are
automatically
restored.
there's
no--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--well,
it
could
be
a
misdemeanor.
there
are
certainly
misdemeanors
punishable
by
more
than
two
years.
in
fact
two
of
the
misdemeanors
at
question
here
that
were
punishable
by
more
than
two
years,
my
client
did
not
serve
a
day
in
jail.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
so
there
are
misdemeanors--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--it...
that's
the
assumption.
but
here
we've
identified
in
at
least
12
states...
excuse
me,
16
states
misdemeanors
punishable
by
more
than
two
years
or
felonies,
rights
are
retained.
so
there
are
states,
for
example,
maryland,
where
rights
are
lost
for
a
misdemeanor
punishable
by
more
than
two
years.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
absolutely.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
well,
in,
for
example,
maryland,
that's
not
the
case.
in
many...
in
12
states,
it
is
the
case.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
there
really
are
only
16
states
in
total
that
have
misdemeanors
punishable
by
more
than
two
years
where
rights
are
retained.
we're
not
talking
about
a
very
big
group
to
begin
with.
this
certainly
is
an
issue
on
the
margins.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
it
only
applies
in
that
instance.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
well,
in
part.
congress
was
specific
in
1996
when
it
enacted
the
lautenberg
amendment,
which
was
the
genesis
for
the
(a)(33)
and
the
prohibition
on
firearms
for
misdemeanor
crimes
of
domestic
violence,
it
was
very...
congress
was
very
specific
that
it
thought
those
types
of
offenders
were
particularly
dangerous.
whereas
when
you
look
at
(a)(20),
yes,
it
generally
applies
to
felons
and
to
misdemeanors
punishable
by
more
than
two
years.
but
in
that
group
of
people,
you
had
varying
degrees
of
seriousness.
you
could
have
embezzlement
convictions--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--i
think
what
we
have
to
look
to
here
is
congress's
clear
choice
in
both.
in
the
firearms
owners'
protection
act
for
(a)(20),
congress
wanted
to
provide
a
broad
exemption
for
individual
states
deemed
to
be
trustworthy.
whereas
in
(a)(33),
congress
was
legislating
under
a
very
different
purpose,
which
was
to
target
misdemeanor
crimes
of
domestic
violence
as
particularly
dangerous
offenders
in
relation
to
gun
possession.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
it
is.
and
i
think
that
it
is
okay
for
the
court
to
decide
that
because
of
the
very
specific
nature
of
only
one
type
of
offender
in
(a)(33),
which
congress
decided
they
didn't
want
them
to
possess
guns.
whereas
in
(a)(20),
the
firearms
owners'
protection
act
had
a
very
different
purpose.
it
was
to
expand
gun
ownership
to
even
felons
who
states
determine
to
be
otherwise
trustworthy.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
our
absurdity
argument
you've
identified
for
(a)(20)
is
more
particular
than
that.
it
is
when
you
look
to
a
particular
state,
because
again
we're
in
the
realm
here
of
delegation
or
at
least
deferring
to
states
this
trustworthy
judgment.
it
is
within
a
particular
state
that
a
less
serious
offender
as
determined
by
that
state
ends
up
being
punished
more
harshly
than
its
more
serious
offenders.
whereas
in
(a)(33)
you
don't
run
into
that
problem.
you
accept
the
anomalies
amongst
the
states.
there
are
varying
states...
ways
to...
states
handle
these
types
of
issues.
but
with
(a)(33)
you
have
one
type
of
offender,
and
a
state
treats
that
offender
in
one
particular
way.
you
aren't
comparing
state
by
state.
we
don't
look
to
wisconsin
versus
louisiana
to
see
an
absurdity.
we
look
within
a
particular
state,
for
example,
in
wisconsin
to
identify
an
absurdity.
there
certainly
is
an
acceptance
when
congress
decided--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--the
difference
here,
i
think,
between
(a)(20)
and
(a)(33)
is
that
congress
was
legislating
under
the
assumption
for
a
felony
you're
going
to
lose
your
civil
rights.
whereas
in
(a)(33)
your
honor
is
correct.
typically
misdemeanors
punishable
by
nine
months
or
up
to
a
year,
rights
are
not
lost.
and
so
i
think
that's
the
difference
your
honor
is
getting
to.
i'm
not
sure
if
i
answered
the
question.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
i
think
it
is
incorrect
in
the
sense
that
when
the
government
sort
of
narrowed
the
number
of
states
that
we
identified
as
being
problem
states,
what
it
ignores
is
that
the
armed
career
criminal
act
and
the
prohibition
against
firearms
goes
back
forever
really.
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
state
law
for
1980s,
'70s
'60s.
now,
the
government
argued,
well,
right
now
there
are
only
a
handful
of
states.
that
might
be
correct
for
now.
but
state
laws
have
changed
over
the
years.
and
so,
we
have
to
look
back
farther.
so,
it
is
a
deeper
problem
than
the
government
identified.
and
i
think
what's
key
is
that
we're
talking
about
congress
separating
dangerous
offenders
from
those
who
are
otherwise
considered
trustworthy
by
a
particular
state.
and
this
court
has
recognized
this
principal
in
both
caron
and
in
small.
and
when
you
are
excluding
from
the
protections
of
the
exemption
clause
offenders
for
which
a
state
has
clearly
identified
as
its
most...
if
you
want
to
consider
them
its
most
trustworthy
offenders,
that
is
absurd.
and
it
certainly
offends
the
societal
norm
that,
all
things
being
equal,
we
don't
punish
less
serious
offenders
more
harshly
than
we
do
more
serious
offenders.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
well,
i...
i
think
the
point
is
that...
that
we
can't
ignore
congress's
clear
intent
to
exempt
the...
the
most
trustworthy
offenders
in
a...
in
a
given
state.
and
that's--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--well,
certainly,
the
federal
statute
set
a
two-year
floor,
if
you
will.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
should
read
the
civil-rights-restored
exception
in
isolation.
i
mean
we
have
to
make
sense
of
congress's
choice
to
look
to
civil
rights.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
well,
we're
talking
about
very
few
states
overall.
i
mean
even
the
problem
we've
identified
is
certainly
a
limited
one.
we're
talking
about
a
dozen
states,
at
most.
and
so
we
can
say,
well,
you
know,
it
vitiates
(b)
because
only
two
states
are
left
that
fall
into
(b).
but
when
we're
talking
about
the
civil
rights
restoration
provision
as
applying
to
rights
retained,
we're
still
only
talking
about
a
dozen
states.
so
i
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
vitiates
(b).
mr.
richard
a.
coad
i
think
that
the
intent
was
broad,
and
congress
was
operating
under
the
assumption
that
rights
would
generally
be
lost
for
those
serious
types
of
offenses
that
it
thought
it
was
covering
in
(a)(20).
and
i
think
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
congressional
record--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--it
is
an
unthought-of
application
of
the
statute
that...
that
leads
to
absurd
results,
which,
if
we
go
with
the
government's
interpretation,
we
frustrate
congress's
intent
with
passing
legislation.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
in
the
context
of
identifying
an
absurdity,
it
certainly
strengthens
the
absurdity
argument
where--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--it's...
it's...
it
might
not
be
absurd
in
(a)(33).
but
congress,
when
it
showed
that...
when
it
chose
to
limit
the
concept
of
restoration,
it
knew
how
to
do
so.
it
was
aware
of
three
circuit
courts
evaluating
(a)(20)
to
include
rights
retained,
and
so
it
did
it
there.
but
it
didn't
do
it
in
(a)(20).
mr.
richard
a.
coad
i
think
that's
different,
because
that's
a
separate
type
of
violation;
whereas,
here
we're
talking
about
an
area
that
congress
clearly
identified,
which
is
how
a
state
treats
the
civil
rights
of
its
offenders.
and
you're
also
talking
about,
in
most
instances,
a
broad,
legislative
determination
that
a
state
decides:
well,
we're
not
going
to
take
them
away,
or
we're
going
to
take
them
away
and
give
them
back;
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
offender.
there
is
no
act
of
forgiveness
on
the
part
of
the
state.
it
is
just
a
broad,
legislative
rule.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
well...
and,
again,
in
(a)(33)
they
did
it
for
a
very
particular
type
of
offender
and
a
different
type
of
offender.
and
i
think,
if
you
even
just
look
at
the
nacdl
lodging,
the
expansiveness
of
it
and
the
amount
of
detail,
none
of
that
is
in
the
congressional
record.
it's
clear
that
congress
didn't
consider
exactly
what
was
going
to
happen
with
the
civil
rights
restored
provision.
they
just
assumed
rights
would
generally
be
lost
for
those
types
of
convictions.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
i...
i
think
that
they
did
legislate
with
respect
to
civil
rights.
they
just
didn't
consider
that
this
certain
circumstance
would
exist.
and
it's...
and
it's
absurd
to
conclude
that
a
less
serious
offender
should
be
included
within
the
federal
ban;
whereas,
a
more
serious
offender
should
not
as
the
state
has
determined.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
it
this
way,
too,
the...
a
state,
in
order
to...
if
the
court
decides:
well,
sorry,
you're
out
of
luck
to
civil
rights
retained,
if
a
state
wishes
to
have
its
less
serious
offenders
avoid
the
federal
ban,
it
would
have
to
treat
them
more
harshly
than
it
currently
does
in
order
for
those
offenders
to
be
treated
better
under
federal
law.
and
i
think
that
that's
an
absurd
notion.
and
i
also...
i
think...
i
just
want
to
give
one
what
i
think
is
the
most
clear
example,
which
is
the
state
of
north
dakota.
we're
not
talking
about
misdemeanors
here.
we're
talking
about
felony
convictions.
in
north
dakota
the
state
has
decided
that
if
a
felon
is
not
sentenced
to
imprisonment,
then
the
felon
retains
his
civil
rights,
and
his
right
to
possess
a
firearm
is
restored
after
a
short
waiting
period.
whereas,
a
felon
who
is
convicted
to...
and
sent
to
prison,
his
rights
are
taken
away
and
later
restored.
so
we
have
the
result
here
of
the
complete
opposite
of
what
north
dakota
intended,
which
is
to
treat
the
less
serious
offender
accordingly
and
treat
the
more
serious
offender
accordingly.
and
that's
directly
contrary
to
congress's
purpose
in
passing
a
firearm
owner's
protection
act,
which
was
in
direct
response
to
this
court's
holding
in
dickerson,
which
ignored
a
state's
expungement
of...
of
a
conviction,
which,
again,
is
another
way
of
a
state
identifying
an
individual
as
trustworthy.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
in
north
dakota...
in
north
dakota
you
can
apply
for
a
pardon,
i
believe.
i'd
have
to
check,
but
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
coad
--yes.
and
so
you're
talking
about
requiring
less
serious
offenders
to
seek,
in
some
instances,
extraordinary
relief
in
order
to
get
on
the
same
footing
as
more
serious
offenders.
and
i...
and
i
would
look
to
point
to
the
example
of
wisconsin
and
the
offenses,
in
particular,
that
we're
talking
about
here.
for
a
misdemeanor
crime
as
a
repeat
offender,
before
2003,
it
was
punishable
by
up
to
three
years.
now
wisconsin
has
changed
that
law,
and
it
is
only
punishable
by
two
years.
so
it
would
be
exempt
under
(b).
but
wisconsin
allows
that
type
of
offender
to
retain
civil
rights
and
to
retain
the
rights
to
possess
a
firearm.
and,
yet,
under
the
government's
reading
and
the
seventh
circuit's
reading
the
federal
statute
would
ignore
that
determination
by
the
state
and
would
impose
the
ban
on
that
individual
and
require
that
individual
to
get
on
the
same
footing
as
a
felon
to
receive
a
pardon,
which
are
generally
not
available
to
misdemeanants
but
are
readily
available
to...
to
felons.
and
so
you
are
talking
about
a
less
serious
offender
having
to
seek
extraordinary
remedies
under
state
laws...
and
this,
i
think,
is
not
just
unique
to
the
state
of
wisconsin...
in
order
to
put
themselves
on
the
same
footing
as
a
more
serious
offender
as
identified
by
that
state.
and
if
i
can
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
thank
you.
mr.
richard
a.
coad
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
i
would
like
to
respond
to
my
colleague's
last
point.
he
speculates
that...
about
legislate
history
and
i
think
actually
it
is
the
exact...
exact
opposite.
congress
enacted
a
firearm
owners
protection
act
to
broaden
exemptions
to
the
gun
control
act.
there's
no
question
about
that,
and
it
did
so
in
a
way
that
would
respect
state
law
decisions
about
who
should
be
eligible
for
exemptions.
and
secondly,
i
was
asked
about...
by
the
court
about
substantive
difference
between
automatic
restoration
of
rights
versus
a
state
automatically
allowing
an
individual
to
retain
rights.
in
many
instances
there's
no
passage
of
time.
there
are
no
additional
conditions
that
an
offender
must
meet
in
order
to
get
that
restoration.
it
is
just
as
automatic
as
not
having
them
taken
away
in
the
first
instance.
and
i
think
my
last
point
to
the
court:
if
the
meaning
of
restored
in
(a)(20)
is
so
clear,
as
the
government
says
it
is,
then
i
don't
know
why
congress
would
need
to
have
added
language
to
(a)(33)
to
clarify
that
they
were
limiting
that
concept
to
only
rights
that
were
taken
away
and
restored.
thank
you.
