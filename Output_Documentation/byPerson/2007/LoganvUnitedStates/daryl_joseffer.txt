mr.
daryl
joseffer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
just
have
a
two
points.
the
first
is
that
restoring
a
right
does
not
mean
leaving
it
alone,
and
the
second
is
that
the
statute
is
not
absurd.
and
for
those
reasons,
petitioner's
prior
offenses
are
violent
felonies
under
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
statute
is
clear
on
point.
it
says
"restored",
and
restoring
a
right
means
giving
back
a
right
that
has
been
taken
away.
it
does
not
mean
leaving
a
right
alone.
and
though
words
can
sometimes
have
different
meanings
in
contexts,
we
are
aware
of
no
context
in
which
"restore"
was
"leave
alone".
and
this
is
certainly
not
such
a
context
because
the
statute
refers
to
a
pardon,
a
set-aside,
an
expungement,
or
a
restoration
of
rights.
and
the
one
thing
that
those
four
items
all
have
in
common
is
that
there
are
ways
which
a
state
essentially
undoes
its
conviction
by
relieving
a
defendant
of
some
or
all
of
the
consequences
of
that
conviction.
giving
back
rights
that
have
been
taken
away
as
part
of
the
conviction
has
that
effect.
simply
leaving
the
rights
alone
does
not.
and
for
that
reason,
because
the
statute
is
so
clear,
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
scope
of
the
statutory
exemption
is
so
absurd
that
this
court
should
take
the
liberty
to
amend
it
in
order
to
add
an
additional
exemption
for
defendants
who
never
lost
their
civil
rights
in
the
first
place.
and
the
court
should
not
do
so
for
numerous
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
absurd
results
canon
applies
only
if
it
is
clear
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
the
result
of
the
plain
statutory
text.
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
and
justice
souter
did
as
well,
we
know
from
the
subsequent
enactment
of
the
domestic
violence
misdemeanor
provision
that
this
result
is
not
something
that's
beyond
congress's
comprehension.
everyone
agrees
that
congress
did
in
fact
mandate
the
supposedly
alleged
absurd
results
in
a
closely
analogous
statute.
and
that's
just
fatal
to
the
absurdity
argument.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
that's
true,
but
my
point
is
just
that
on
the
face
of
the
domestic
violence
statute,
and
what
it
says
is
that
the
restoration
of
rights
exception
is
limited
to
circumstances
where
the
law
of
the
applicable
jurisdiction
provides
for
the
loss
of
civil
rights.
so
on
the
face
of
that
provision...
the
provision
says
restoration
occurs
only
if
civil
rights
have
been
lost.
so
it's
clear
as
day
that
what
congress
was
saying
there
was
it
was
mandating
the
allegedly
absurd
result
here
in
situations
where
rights
were
not
lost.
and
what
that
means
is
that
you
can't
say
that
it's
impossible
that
congress--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--there
is...
in
the
context
of
subsection
(33)...
in
the
context
of
the
domestic
violence
misdemeanor
provision--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--there
is
one
circuit
that
has
applied...
that
has
basically
overlooked
the
plain
language
there,
not
even
attempted
to
deal
with
the
plain
language
there.
and
it's
true,
and
it's
found
that
that
exemption
was
somehow
satisfied
in
a
situation
where
civil
rights
were
never
taken
away
or
restored.
but
the
fact
that,
you
know,
a
court
of
appeals
reached
that
conclusion
without
even
attempting
to
take
a
look
at
the
statutory
language
doesn't
diminish
the
very
plain
meaning--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--of
the
statutory
language.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
it
was
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
burgin
case,
i
believe
it's
called.
and
the
sixth
circuit
there,
similar
to
the
first
circuit
in
construing
this
statute,
was
very
clear
that
it
was
just
skipping
the
language
and
doing
what
it
thought
congress
would
have
wanted
to
do
if
it
had
thought
about
it.
but
the
plain
language
in
the
domestic
violence
provision
is
unmistakable
because
it
expressly
refers
to
civil
rights--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--the
reason
is
that
congress
was
balancing
two
policies.
on
the
one
hand,
what
it
was
looking
to
do
in
this
provision
was
to
defer
to
a
state's
decision
to
essentially
undo
its
conviction.
and
that
applies
where
rights
have
been
taken
away
and
restored,
but
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
rights
being
left
alone.
on
the
other
hand,
and
a
couple
of
justices
already
made
this
point
as
well,
congress
wanted
to
apply
the
federal
firearms
disability
to
serious
felonies,
to
felonies
punishable
by
more
than
two
years
of
imprisonment,
but
if
congress
had
included
a
retention
of
rights
exemption,
that
would
have
all
but
gutted
the
statutory
prohibition
on
serious
misdemeanants
possessing
firearms.
and
that's
why,
consistent
with
congress's
desire
to
get
tough
on
firearms
and
impose
the
firearms
disability
on
serious
felons,
it
couldn't
include
a
retention
of
rights
exemption.
so
it's
a
situation
where
congress
had
a
couple
of
different
policies.
it
clearly
pursued
both
of
them,
and
as
a
result,
there
is
a
seam,
there
is
this
anomaly
that
petitioners
have
pointed
to,
but
that's
an
inevitable
consequence
of
congress's
desire
to
balance
these
two
policies.
and
because
that's
an
inevitable
and
probably
foreseen
result
of
congress's
intent,
it
doesn't
call
congress's
intent
into
question.
in
addition,
the
scope
of
the
anomalies
here
is
really
quite
minor.
there
are...
if
you...
read
according
to
its
plain
language,
there
are
a
few
states
in
which
the
petitioner...
the
anomaly
the
petitioner
points
to
occurs.
it's
currently
about
three
states.
it
used
to
be
about
six
states.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
take
petitioner's
view,
you
create
anomaly
in
a
couple
other
states,
which
justice
ginsburg
referred
to,
whereby
the
most
serious
offenders,
first-degree
murderers,
would
not
be
treated
as
having
their
civil
rights
restored.
but
in
all
of
these
states,
the
effect
of
the
anomaly
is
greatly
reduced
by
the
firearms
exception
to
the
restoration
of
rights
exemption
because
in...
petitioner's
example
was
north
carolina,
where
he
said
that
a
more
serious
offender
would
be
able
to
get
firearms
rights
back
promptly.
i
guess
what
he
meant
by
10
years
after
completing
the
sentence
if
he
had
not
committed
further
crimes.
so
the
incidence
of
this
issue
is
really
not
very
significant.
instead,
the
real
significance
to
departing
from
the
plain
statutory
language
would
be
to
gut
the
statute
as
applied
to
misdemeanors
punishable
by
tiers
of
imprisonment,
which
is
contrary
to
congress's
clearly
expressed
intent
by
including
such
misdemeanors
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
petitioner
has
also
argued
at
length
that
what
congress
was
looking
at
here
was
trustworthiness.
did
the
state
find
the
defendant
trustworthy
to
possess
firearms?
but
we
know,
and
this
court
explained
in
caron,
that
that's
not
what
this
provision
goes
to
because
the
whole
point
of
the
federal
firearms
laws
is
to
prohibit
firearms
possession
in
some
circumstances
where
at
least
some
states
were
permitting
it.
so
the
fact
that
a
state
would
let
a
person
possess
firearms
is
not
relevant
here.
instead,
congress
was
not
deferring
generally
to
the
states'
trustworthiness
views
but
instead
was
looking
to
defer
to
their
specific
determination
to
essentially
undo
their
own
conviction.
if
a
state
wanted
to
undo
its
own
conviction,
congress
was
willing
to
give
effect
to
that,
but
that's
the
only
thing
it
was
deferring
to.
and
it
also
bears
emphasis
that
congress--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right.
that's--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
there's
still
substance
to
the
fact
that
rights
were,
in
fact,
taken
away
and
were,
in
fact,
restored,
as
opposed
to
someone
having
his
rights
all
the
time.
there's
certainly
a
substantive
legal
difference
there,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
mean
one
reason
that
congress
may
have
decided
not
to
distinguish
between
automatic
and
individualized
restorations
of
rights
is
simply
that
it
didn't
want
to
attempt
to
micromanage
the
states
in
how
they
would
go
about
choosing
to
do
a
pardon
or
a
restoration
of
rights.
i
mean...
and...
with
respect
to
restoration
or
rights.
louisiana
automatically
pardons
most
first-time
offenders.
as
this
court
explained
in
dickerson,
of
the
states
that
expunge
convictions,
many
of
them
do
it
automatically
as
well.
and
so
congress
from...
because
of
what
it
was
doing
here
was
advocating
dickerson,
was
presumably
aware
of
these
points
this
court
had
made
in
dickerson
regarding
the
great
variance
in
the
laws
and
the
fact
some
of
it
was
automatic.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
most.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
most,
and--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
don't...
i
think
that
they
are
not
automatically
pardoned.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
in
fact,
this
practice
is
enshrined
in
the
louisiana
constitution.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
the
point
is
just
that
congress
was
going
to
defer
to
the
states'
decision
to
effectively
undo
their
convictions,
but
was
not
going
to
micromanage
how
the
states
did
it.
but
the
most
that
one
might
determine
from
that
point
of
view
is
that
if
you
think
that
congress
was
really
thinking
about
an
individualized
determination,
then
what
that
would
mean
is
that
some
offenders
who
get
automatic
restorations
are
currently
essentially
catching
a
break
from
the
fact
that
they
got
an
automatic
one.
but
the
fact
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
may
give
someone
of
the
offenders
a
break
is
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
to
give
other
offenders
a
break
that
congress
clearly
did
not
intend.
and,
justice
scalia,
you
asked
about
what's
a
typical
restoration
process.
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1986,
of
the
states
that
did
restorations,
about
half
of
them
did
it
automatically
and
about
half
of
them
required
individualized
consideration
before
returning
at
least
one
of
the
rights.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
there's
some
variance.
in
fact,
the
50
states
follow
49
different
approaches
to
revoking
and
restoring
civil
rights.
so
there's
an
exception
to
just
about
anything
in
this
area,
which
again
underscores
why
anomalies
are
inevitable,
and
therefore
don't
really
call
congress's
intention
into
question.
but
the
standard
practice
is
that
after
a
defendant
has
finished
serving
his
sentence,
and
that
would
include
not
just
maybe
one
day
in
jail
but
also
the
probationary
period
following
that...
but
after
the
defendant
has
finished
serving
his
sentence,
if
restoration
is
automatic,
it
will
either
be
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
or
at
some
time
period
thereafter,
which
in
some
instances
can
be
significantly
thereafter.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
think
that's
true.
i
guess
there
are
two
parts
to
that.
one
is
that,
i
mean,
the
provisions
at
issue
here
about
the
length
of
sentence
served,
were
in
the
statute
before
this
amendment
was
made.
they
were
in
the
statute
before
1986.
so
they're
not
directly
relevant
to
the
intent
of
the
'86
congress.
but
i'm
not
aware
of...
i
mean,
of
legislative
history
predating
1986
in
which
congress
looked
at
the
length
as
opposed
to
the
maximum
term.
and
also,
one
thing
that
reflects
is
that
what
congress
was
not
doing
here
was
just
looking
to
defer
to
the
states'
trustworthiness
determinations
as
this
court
explained
in
caron.
the
whole
point
of
this
law
was
to
get
tougher
on
gun
crime
than
many
of
the
states
were
at
the
time.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions?
