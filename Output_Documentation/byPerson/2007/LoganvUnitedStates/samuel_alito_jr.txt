well,
with
respect
to
the
in-state
anomaly
that
you
were
talking
about,
the
government
argues
on
page
30...
29
and
30
of
its
brief
that
there
really
are
only
a
few
states
where
this
exists,
and
even
in
those...
even
in
the
states
where
it
exists,
there
are
very
significant
restrictions
on
the
ability
of
the
felon
to
obtain
restoration
of
civil
rights.
is
that
incorrect?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
congress
thought
about
the
problem,
what
reason
could
they
have
for
saying
that
the
firearms
ban
should
apply
to
someone
who
never
lost
his
or
her
civil
rights,
but
not...
but
would
not
apply
to
someone
who
had
civil
rights
restored?
automatically,
let's
say.
automatically
and
within
a
short
period
of
time.
what
rationale
reason
could
there
be
for
doing
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
can
understand
that
argument
where
there's
an
individualized
determination
about
each...
each
defendant,
but
i
don't
quite
understand
it
when
it's
a
blanket
restoration
of
rights.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
a
formal
difference
matter.
there's
no
substance
to
it,
is
there?
