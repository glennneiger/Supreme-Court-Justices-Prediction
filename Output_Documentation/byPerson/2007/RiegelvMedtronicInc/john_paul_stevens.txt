mr.
olson,
suppose
the
manufacturer
did
not
provide
information.
would
the
preemption
nevertheless
exist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
as
a
theoretical
possibility,
there
could
be
a
newly
discovered
risk
that
the
fda
never
knew
about.
and,
nevertheless,
the
claim
would
be
preemptive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
answer
one
thing
for
me
on
that?
is
that
a...
as
soon
as
they
get
the
information
requirement,
or
is
it
an
annual
requirement
that
they
have
to
take--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
of
course
the
fda
took
this
contrary
position
some
years
ago.
