mr.
olson,
that
still
leaves
the...
sort
of
the
hiatus
that
justice
kennedy's
question
was
addressed
to.
and
i...
i
don't
think
i
understand
your
answer
to
it.
his
question
was
what
if
the
manufacturer
has
learned
that
there
is...
that
there's
a
problem
that
somebody
hadn't
anticipated?
the
manufacturer
has
told
the
fda,
and
the
fda
has
not
yet
acted.
leave
open
the
question
of
whether
the
fda
is
slow
or
whether
it
just
takes
time,
but
there's
a...
there's
a
hiatus
here.
and
an
injury
occurs
because
of
marketing
that
took
place
during
the
hiatus.
does
preemption
still
apply?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
kneedler,
let
me
ask
you
to...
a
textual
question
which
perhaps
would
be
better
directed
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
but
let
me
get
your
take
on
it.
if
the
only
objective
in
the...
in
the
preemption
clause
were
to
preclude
state
pma
in
addition
to
federal
pma,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
include
the
phrase...
would
there
have
been
any
reason
to
include
a
preclusion
of
a
requirement
that
is
different
from
in
addition
to
a
preclusion
of
something
which
is
in
addition
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
"addition
to"
would
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
do
you
draw
the
line
between
those
instances
and
the
ones
that
you
say
are
not
preempted?
justice
david
h.
souter
they...
they
were
requirements,
in
other
words,
of
positive
law?
they
were
state
regulations?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
so
the
line
is
simply
enactment
of
positive
law
versus
jury
award?
that's
the
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
just
want
to
make
sure--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
your
position
is.
that
is
where
you
draw
the
line
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
