justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
before
that
decision
is
reached,
let
me
ask
you
this...
under
state
law,
either
generally
or
specifically
under
the
law
of
the
state
that
you
are
trying
to
invoke
here,
does
the
jury...
does
the
finder
of
fact
weigh
the
potential
risks
of
injury
and
illness
against
the
probable
benefits
to
the
health
of
the
patient?
is
that
one
of
the
things
the
jury
does?
in
other
words,
suppose
this
was
a
very
important
device,
but
it
had
a
one
percent
risk.
does
the
jury
consider
that
when
it
determines
whether
that's
been
negligently
sold?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
alright,
now
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
fda
measured
in
the
pma
process?
the--
fda
is
specifically
charged
with
weighing
the
risks
against
the
probable
benefits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
jury
is
doing
the
same
thing
that
the
fda
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
was
under
the
expedited
510(k).
that's
different
than
pma,
because
in
pma
there's
a
specific
weight.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
medtronic
free
to
alter
this
label
without
the
fda's
consent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
citation
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
manufacturer
free
to
continue
to
sell
the
device
after
newly
discovered
risks--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--pending
the
fda's
acting
on
the
same
information?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
takes
time
for
the
fda
to
act.
let's
assume
that
we
know
it's
going
to
take
six
months
for
the
fda
to
do
this.
the
manufacturer
knows
that
there's
a
real
problem.
he
can
continue
to
sell
in
the
face
of
the
knowledge
of
the
real
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
asking
you
about
the
manufacturer's
duty
pending
the
fda's
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
manufacturer
finds
just
from
its
own
laboratory
experiments
and
not
because
of
any
data
it's
received
from
doctors
and
patients
that
there's
a
better
way
to
do
this,
does
it
have
the
obligation
to
notify
the
fda?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
a
label
is
approved
in
a
very
specific
form
under
pma,
and
then
a
year
later,
it
turns
out,
unforeseen
by
anyone,
that
doctors
are
just...
many
good
doctors
are
just
reading
it
the
wrong
way
and
it's
dangerous.
can
the
manufacturer
continue
to
sell
new
devices
with
the
same
label
pending
the
annual
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
take--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
take
my
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
could...
and
the
manufacturer
continued
to
sell
the
device
knowing
that
the
label
is
being
misconstrued
by
very
good
doctors
pending
fda
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
it's
very
serious.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
failure
to
give
that
notice
subject
the
manufacturer
to
liability
if
the
manufacturer
continues
to
sell
the
device?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
i
read
in
order
to
verify
your
statement
that
the...
that
manufacturers
can
cure
the
label
without
fda
approval?
where
do
i
find
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
