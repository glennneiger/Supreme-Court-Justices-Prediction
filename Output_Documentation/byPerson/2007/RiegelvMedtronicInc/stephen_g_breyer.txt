justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
was
something
a
little
different
than
that.
the
question
that
i
have
which
might
be
helpful
to
me,
if
you
can
answer
it,
is...
that's
being
serious
about
it...
i'd
be
helped
by
knowing
what
the
specific
design
defect
is
that
you
claim?
that
is,
in
what
respect
was
this
catheter...
and
i'd
like
you
to
refer
to
the
details
of
the
catheter...
in
what
respect,
what
material
or
what
shape
or
what...
what
it
is
about
this
catheter
that
you
as
the
plaintiff
think
was
designed
defectively,
if
you
can
tell
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
but
you
must
have
a
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it
about
the
design
that
you
are
saying
is
not
safe?
that
is,
you
can't
go
into
the
court
without
having
in
your
mind,
as
the
counsel,
that
some
kind
of
specific
thing
that
was
wrong
with
this
catheter,
other
than
just
using
the
words
"design".
i
mean,
how
was
it
designed
badly?
what
part
of
the
design
is
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
saying
the
material
of
the
balloon
should
have
been
of
a
different
material
or
a
different
thickness;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
that
mean?
how
do
you
design
something
to
burst?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
don't
know
how
to
design
the
balloon,
what
are
you
basing
the
design
claim
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
tell
you
why
i
asked
my
question,
because
i
don't
want
to
leave...
you
to
leave
with
an
unfavorable
impression
in
my
mind
on
your
issue
without
your
having
a
chance
to
see.
what's
worrying
me
is
that,
of
course,
it's
a
terrible
thing
when
somebody
is
hurt
in
these
kinds
of
accidents.
and
the
lawyers
are
trying
to
help.
so
the
lawyers
will
think,
look,
there's
a
problem
here.
there
must
be.
my
client
was
seriously
hurt.
and
he's
not
supposed
to
be.
and
then
they'll
work
backward
from
that
and
say
well
if
he
was
hurt,
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
the
design.
so
every
time
there
is
an
accident
or
something
bad
happens,
the
lawyers
assert
a
design
claim
and
they
gear
up
discovery.
and
in
my
mind,
could
congress
have
intended
that
kind
of
thing
when
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
have
a
group
of
experts
really
look
into
this
and
decide
whether
it
should
marketed
or
not.
that's
what's
bothering
me.
and
that's
why
i
would
like
you
to
respond
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
are
they
not
conflicting?
go
ahead;
go
ahead...
elaborate.
