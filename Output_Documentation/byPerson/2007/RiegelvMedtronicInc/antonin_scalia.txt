justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
manufacturer
wants
to
make
what
you
call
an
improvement?
can
it
simply
market
the
product
with
that
improvement
without
further
fda
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
is
designed
to
improve
safety
and
effectiveness?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
those
devices
had
not
been...
they
were
just
grandfathered.
they
had
not
been
specifically
approved
as
safe
and
effective
by
the
fda.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
state
requirement
there?
i
mean,
what
was
the
federal
requirement
there?
it
was
simply
that
the
device
had
been
on
the
market
before
the
law
became
effective.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
point
is
that
the...
to
follow
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
the
point
is
that
the
fda
in
lohr
had
never
made
a
determination
of
weighing
the
risks
against
the
benefits,
as
they
do
for
the
issuance
of
pma's.
and
so
the
jury
was
not
replowing
the
same
ground
that
the
fda
had
already
plowed
in
lohr.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
mean
that,
under
the
food
and
drug
regulation,
the
states
can
issue
their
own
regulations
that
contradict
the
federal
approval?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
talking
about
drugs.
not
medical
devices.
you
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
no.
i
mean,
you
can
comply
with
both.
it's
just
additional...
you
have
to
go
further
to
comply
with
the
state
rule,
so
there's
no
conflict.
it's
easy
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
the
states
can
issue
regulations
that
go
beyond...
beyond
what
the
fda
says
in
drug
matters?
i
would
be
surprised
if
that's
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
the
only
basis
here?
conflict...
there's
no
conflict?
it's
all
okay
under
the
medical
devices
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
add
additional
requirements
so
long
as...
and
i
suppose
they
can
do
this
by
regulation...
so
long
as
these
additional
requirement
dos
not
prevent
complying
with
the
federal
requirements?
so
long
as
there's
no
conflict,
the
states
can
add
additional
requirements
under
the
medical
devices
act?
that's
not
my
understanding
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
field
preemption,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
not
the
way
i
would...
the
jury
has
to
say
that?
i
mean,
in
fact--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
fact,
that's
what's
going
on,
but
it
could
have
been
safe
if...
if
they
had
made
the
change
that
the
fda
rejected.
but
the
case
goes
to
the
jury
and
that's,
in
fact,
what's
going
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trial
is,
you
know,
had
he...
had
he
made
this
change,
it
would
have
been
safe,
but
he
didn't
make
the
change
and,
therefore,
you,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
should
hold
the
company
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
just
has
to
be
the
theory
of
the
case.
we
have
to
look
at
each
jury
verdict
and
decide
whether
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
jury
made
the
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
under
state
law,
but
you...
you
don't
say
that
federal
preemption
requires
that;
you
say
that
by
the
grace
of
new
york
state,
that
may
be
the
situation,
but
new
york
state
can
change
that
law,
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
new
york
state
can
let
it
go
to
the
jury,
despite...
despite
what
the
fda
has
done.
you've
said
that
it's
simply
a
defense
under
new
york
state
law
and
the
law
of
most
states.
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
defense
under
new
york
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
the
point
justice
ginsburg
was
implying.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
this
is
all
a
little
unrealistic.
it
is
not
as
though
some
expert
agency
of
the
state
has
conducted
a
very
scientific
inquiry
and
decided
that
there's
something
safer
than
what
the
fda
approved
or
that
it's
negligent
to
issue
what
the
fda
approved.
what's
going
on
is
simply
one
jury
has
decided
that
in
its
judgment,
there
was
a
safer
device
that
should
have
been
used;
and
because
of
the
judgment
of
that
one
jury,
the
manufacturer
is
placed
at
risk
in
selling
a
device
that
scientists
at
the
fda
have
said
is
okay.
i
find
that
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
olson,
the
other
side
says
well,
you
know,
these
are
all
horribles
but,
in
fact,
we
have
had
tort
suits
and
manufacturers
haven't
taken
their
products
off
the
market.
this
is
all
just
a
chicken
little
kind
of
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
additional
requirements
are
not
necessarily
conflicting
requirements.
you
can
comply
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is
clear
that
congress
didn't
want
additional
requirements.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
also
a
different
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much...
how
many
years
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
we
expect
them
to
come
out
with
the
same--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
like
the
previous
two
cases,
it
pertains
to
that
considerable
part
of
our
business
which
consists
of
sorting
out
the
relationship
between
federal
law
and
state
law.
this
case
involves
the
major
federal
statute
governing
medical
devices
known
as
the
medical
device
amendments
act
of
1976.
before
that
law
was
passed,
regulation
of
medical
devices
was
left
almost
entirely
to
the
states
and
common
law
tort
actions
were
the
principle
method
of
ensuring
that
manufacturers
did
not
market
dangerous
or
ineffective
medical
devices.
the
medical
device
amendments
act
changed
this.
it
created
a
detailed
scheme
of
federal
oversight.
the
law
divides
medical
devices
into
three
groups.
class
iii,
the
group
relevant
to
this
case
contains
devices
subject
to
particularly
searching
safety
review,
including
the
process
known
as
pre-market
approval.
some
class
iii
devices
are
exempt
from
the
process,
but
manufacturers
of
the
remaining
class
iii
devices,
which
include
the
device
at
issue
here,
may
not
market
their
products
until
they
receive
approval
from
the
food
and
drug
administration.
manufacturers
submit
to
the
agency,
what
is
typically
a
multivolume
application,
including
among
other
things,
a
description
of
the
devices
designed
and
how
it
will
be
manufactured,
a
specimen
of
the
device's
proposed
labeling
and
the
contents
of
any
--
any
and
all
known
studies
concerning
the
device.
the
food
and
drug
administration
spends
an
average
of
1200
hours
reviewing
each
application.
it
approves
an
application
only
if
it
finds
there
is
a
"reasonable
assurance"
of
the
devices'
safety
and
effectiveness
under
the
specifications
in
the
application.
it
lays
the
benefits
of
the
device
against
its
risks.
this
means
that
it
--
that
it
approves
some
devices
that
are
very
risky
indeed,
where
for
example,
they
provide
the
only
hope
for
remedying
an
otherwise
fatal
condition.
once
a
device
has
been
approved,
the
manufacturer
may
not
make
changes
that
would
affect
the
devices'
safety
or
effectiveness
without
returning
to
the
agency
for
another
round
of
safety
review.
when
congress
added
to
the
authority
of
federal
regulators
through
the
medical
device
amendments,
it
took
away
authority
from
the
states.
the
law
provides
that
no
state
shall
"establish
or
continue
in
effect
with
respect
to
a
device
intended
for
human
use"
any
requirement
which
is
different
from
or
in
addition
to
any
requirement
applicable
to
the
device
under
federal
law
and
which
relates
to
the
safety
or
effectiveness
of
the
device.
thus,
when
the
federal
government
requires
that
a
device
be
marketed
in
--
in
one
form,
a
state
may
not
require
that
the
device
be
marketed
in
a
different
form.
in
this
case,
petitioner,
donna
riegel
and
her
husband
charles
riegel,
filed
a
lawsuit
against
respondent,
medtronic
inc.,
under
new
york
tort
law.
charles
riegel
had
been
seriously
injured
when
a
catheter
manufactured
by
medtronic
burst
during
heart
surgery.
the
catheter
was
a
class
iii
medical
device
that
had
received
pre-market
approval
from
the
food
and
drug
administration.
the
riegels
contended
that
even
if
the
catheter
was
manufactured
in
accordance
with
specifications
that
the
agency
had
approved,
the
device
was
unsafe
and
improperly
labeled
under
new
york
law.
they
contended
as
relevant
here
that
medtronic
was
liable
under
the
state's
common
law
rules
of
strict
liability,
implied
warranty,
and
negligence.
mr.
riegel
has
since
died
and
his
wife
presses
his
claims
as
administrator
of
his
estate.
she
argues
that
the
preemption
clause
bars
only
state
regulatory
provisions
and
not
common
law
claims.
the
second
circuit
disagreed,
and
so
do
we.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
food
and
drug
administration's
review
is
to
determine
the
appropriate
balance
between
risks
and
benefits.
when
state
common
law
rules
permit
a
jury
to
recalculate
that
balance,
the
federal
scheme
is
frustrated,
no
less
than
when
a
state
regulatory
scheme
takes
the
same
action.
indeed,
leaving
the
recalculation
to
a
jury
on
a
case-by-case
basis
is
arguably
even
worse.
since
the
jury
has
before
it,
only
the
injured
plaintiff
and
no
one
speaks
for
those
who
would
be
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
the
admittedly
risky
device,
if
manufacturers
could
not
rely
upon
fda
approval.
as
i
have
described,
states
are
prohibited
for
maintaining
requirements
with
respect
to
approved
devices
that
are
"different
from,
or
in
addition
to"
the
federal
requirements.
in
the
last
analysis,
common
law
claims
rest
upon
state
law
requirements.
they
are
premised
on
the
existence
of
state
law
duty
and
a
tort
judgment
represents
a
determination
that
a
defendant
violated
that
duty.
we
have,
therefore,
treated
other
statutes
that
preempts
state
requirements
as
preempting
state
common
law
obligations.
congress
is
entitled
to
know
what
meaning
this
court
will
assign
to
terms
regular
--
regularly
used
in
its
enactments
and
we
see
no
reason
to
give
the
word
requirements
a
different
meaning
here.
petitioner
contends
that
the
medical
device
amendments
preempt
only
state
duties
that
relate
exclusively
to
medical
devices.
by
its
terms,
however,
the
statute
preempts
any
requirement
"continued
in
effect
with
respect
to"
a
medical
device
without
regard
to
whether
the
requirement
is
also
continued
in
effect
with
respect
to
other
products.
petitioner
pins
her
narrower
view
of
preemption
on
a
regulation
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
the
agency
itself,
however,
does
not
interpret
its
regulation
in
that
fashion
and
parts
of
the
regulation
make
little
sense
unless
the
preemption
clause
is
understood
to
apply
to
general
common
law
duties.
in
the
last
analysis,
we
conclude
that
the
regulation
neither
assists
nor
contradicts
our
interpretation
of
the
statutory
text.
accordingly,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
