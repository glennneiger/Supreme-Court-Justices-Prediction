ms.
allison
m.
zieve
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
section
360k(a)
of
the
medical
device
amendment
to
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
preempts
state
law
claims
seeking
damages
for
injuries
caused
by
a
device
that
received
pre-market
approval.
medtronic's
view
of
the
pre-market
approval
process
is
that
it
results
in
an
fda
decision
that
a
particular
device
must
be
designed,
labeled,
and
manufactured
in
a
particular
way.
this
view
is
incorrect,
and
so
i
want
to
talk...
begin
by
talking
about
what
pre-market
approval
is
and
what
it
isn't.
pma
is
fda's
permission
to
market
a
class
3
device.
the
manufacturer
pma
device
develops
the
design
and
chooses
the...
choosing
it
on
its
own.
after
the
company
submits
the
application,
the
fda
evaluates
it,
based
on
information
submitted,
but
it
does
no
independent
testing,
no
product
development,
no
comparison
with
other
products
to
see
if
this
one
is
as
good
as
or
better
than
existing
products...
or
even
if
it's
the
best
that
it
can
be.
if
the
information
submitted
by
the
company
meets
the
statutory
standard,
reasonable
assurance
of
safety
and
effectiveness,
the
fda
grants
pma,
thus
permitting
the
device
to
be
sold.
so
the
fda
approves
the
design
and
labeling
chosen
by
the
manufacturer,
but
the
agency
doesn't
require
the
manufacturer
to
choose...
to
make
those
choices.
once
on
the
market,
a
pma
device
may
prove
to
be
unsafe,
because
very
often
problems
and
hazards
come
to
light
only
after
the
device
is
in
widespread
use.
so--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
yes
and
no.
the
requirement
about
submitting
adverse
event
reports
and
the
annual
report
are
intended
help
the
fda
to
monitor
the
device
after
it's
on
the
market.
but
the
responsibility
and
the
opportunity
to
improve
the
design
or
labeling
or
to
initiate
a
recall
is
really
on
the
manufacturer
in
the
first
instance,
because
the
manufacturer
is
the
first
one
to
learn
about
the
problem.
the
fda
has
a
more
passive
role.
the
fda
receives
the
information
that
the
manufacturer
sends
to
it--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--depending
on
whether
it
is
a
design
or
labeling
change,
the
answer
is
different.
for
a
labeling
change,
some
changes
can
be
made
prior
to
fda
approval.
for
design
changes,
any
change
that
affects
safety
and
effectiveness
can't
be
made
without
a
further
submission
to
the
fda.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
right.
and
in
that
way
a
pma
device
is
no
different
from
the
510(k)
device
that
this
court
considered
in
lohr,
because
with
respect
to
those
devices
as
well,
any
change
that
would
have
a
significant
effect
on
safety
and
effectiveness
has
to
await
a
new
submission
and
a
new--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--right.
but
the
question
isn't
what
the
level
of
pre-market
scrutiny
is.
the
question
is
what
requirements
are
imposed
on
the
manufacturer
at
the
end
of
the
process
when
the
device
enters
the
market.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
the
standard
in
new
york
is
whether
the
product
is
unreasonably
hazardous.
i
think
the
term
unreasonably--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--that's
right.
and
in
that
way,
the
state--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--yes.
and
as
this
court
said
in
lohr
and
in
bates,
when
the
state
law
mirrors
the
federal
law,
there
is
no
preemption.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
what
the
fda
does
before
the
product
reaches
the
market
is
different
in
the
pma
context
as
opposed
to
510(k).
but
when
it
comes
to
comparing
the
state
and
federal
requirements...
i
think
is
what
you
are
getting
at...
lohr's
analysis
and
the
analysis
in
bates
v.
dow
agrosciences,
inc.
didn't
turn
on
how
rigorous
the
fda
requirements
are,
but
are
they
parallel
to
the
state
requirements.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
design
requirement
in
lohr?
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
it
had
to
be
substantially
equivalent,
safety
and
effectiveness,
to
a
device
that
was
grandfathered
in,
that's
right.
but
medtronic
argued
in
that
case
that
it
couldn't
change
the
design
of
that
product
without
filing
another
submission
to
the
fda,
and
that
that
was
why
there's
preemption,
and
that's
the
same
argument--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--i
don't
think
that
goes
to
preemption
under
360k(a)
which
looks
for
a
specific
federal
requirement,
a
state
device
requirement,
and
then
looks
at...
compares
the
two
to
see
if
there
are
counterparts.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
under
the
common
law
of
most
or
all
states,
compliance
with
federal
law
is
a
defense
on
the
merits,
and
it
is
not
usually
dispositive,
but
in
some
states...
in
some
states
it
is.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
absolutely.
i
don't
think
that
the
pma
is
irrelevant
to
the
tort
suit.
it's
just
not
sufficient
for
preemption--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
there
is
no
express
preemption
provision
in
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
with
respect
to
drugs.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
right.
but
i
think
in
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
express
preemption
provision
means,
it's
actually
useful
to
consider
why
there's
none
for
drugs
and
there
is
one
for
devices.
and
the
reason
is
because
drugs
were
regulated
by
the
fda
since
1938.
devices
weren't
regulated
until
1976.
so,
in
those
intervening
38
years,
states
had
stepped
in
and
started
to
do
some
regulation
on
their
own
to
fill
that
regulatory
void.
california
is
the
most
notable
example,
and
the
one
discussed
the
legislative
history.
so,
when
drafting
the
medical
device
amendments
and
coming
up
with
the
system
for
pre-market
scrutiny,
the
question
arose,
well,
what
about
california?
what
about
other
states
that
are
regulating
good
manufacturing
practices?
or
california
had
a
pma
scheme
of
its
own.
and
so
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
congress,
faced
with
this
dilemma,
decided
california
shouldn't
be
able
to
continue
to
regulate
devices
in
that
way.
it
shouldn't
be
able
to
pre-screen
devices
once
the
fda
had
stepped
in
and
filled
the
federal
void.
and
that's
why
you
didn't
need
an
express
preemption
provision
for
drugs.
the
states
weren't
doing
that
in
1938,
but
because
the
government...
the
federal
government
waited
so
long
to
regulate
devices,
it
was
necessary
to
say
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
these
state
regulations?
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
they
couldn't
issue
regulations
that
contradict
the
federal
approvals
because
of
the
express
preemption
provision.
but
without
it,
california--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--that
would
be
a
conflict
preemption
question.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
if
there's
no
conflicts,
then
there
would
be
no
preemption.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
if
there's...
the
only
basis
for
preemption
with
respect
to
drugs
is
conflict
preemption.
so,
if
your
question
incorporates
if
there's
no
conflict,
then
there
would
no
preemption.
but--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
here,
if
there
is
not
a
specific
federal
requirement
that
is
the
counterpart
to
a
state
requirement,
there
is
no
preemption.
that's
what...
that's
the
language
that
congress
wrote
and--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--no.
that--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
the...
when
the
fda
has
spoken
directly
to
a
question,
then
the
state
cannot
impose
requirements
that
are
different
from
or
in
addition
to
what
the
fda
has
said.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
if
the...
if
360k(a)
ever
preempts
tort
claims,
i
think
that
would
be
a
situation,
but
if...
only
the
tort
claim
is...
is
specific
in
that
way,
that
you...
that
the
company
failed
in
its
duty
of
care
because
it
didn't
design
the
device
in
the
specific
way
that
the
fda
had
rejected.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
that--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
the--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--but
if
that's
the
theory
of
the
case,
i
think
that's
basically
the
one-inch/two-inch
hearing
aid
fix
of
justice
breyer's
example
in
lohr.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
but
most
tort
claims--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
it's...
it's
not
actually
that
hard,
because
most
tort
claims
are--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--yes.
that's
right.
and
i
thought,
justice--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--can...
i'm
sorry.
can
change
which
law?
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
think
that's
a
different
point.
generally--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--yes.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes.
in
a
situation
where
the
fda
has
said
you
are
required
not
to
market
this
specific
device
and
the
state...
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
to
impose
a
common-law
duty
that
you
must
market
that
specific
design,
then
you
would
have
counterpart
state
and
federal
regulations,
but
the--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--the
relevance
of--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--yes.
i
think
that's
justice
breyer's
two-inch
hearing
aid
fix,
when
the
federal
government
says
you
must
and
the
state
law
duty
says
that
you
cannot.
but
the...
that's
not
how
tort
claims
are
litigated
as
a
general
matter.
first
of
all,
pma's
don't
say
you
must
have
this
design
feature.
there's--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--exactly.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that's
right.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
and
if
you
look
at--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
first
of
all,
if
the
device
is
reasonably
safe
and
effective,
then
the
company
is
just
not
going
to
stop
marketing
it
because
of
tort
suits.
and
we
know
that
because--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--right.
but
we
know
that
manufacturers
don't
respond
by
taking
devices
off
the
market,
because
pma
has
coexisted
with
tort
suits
since
1976.
for
instance,
recently--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
i...
they
should
make
their
devices
as
safe
as
they
can
be.
and
if
a
tort
suit
points
out
that
this
device
is
not
reasonably
safe,
then
the
manufacturer--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--that's
right.
and
360k
looks
to
requirements.
it's
not
a
matter
of
policy
what
the
effect
of
tort
suits
is.
the
question
is
what
are
the
requirements
imposed
by
the
pma,
what
requirements
are
imposed
by
state
law.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
any
one
of
us
might
have
drawn
the
line
differently.
but
the
line
congress
drew
was
when
there
is
a
specific
federal
requirement,
we
looked
for
a
device
counterpart
state
requirement.
and
where
they
don't
exist,
there
is
no
preemption.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
there's
not
a
lot
of
discovery
about
the
design
of
the
catheter.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
general
theory
is
that
the
design
was
unreasonably
safe
because
the
catheter
should
not
have...
should
have
been
strong
enough--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--the
strength
of
the
balloon
and
the
way
in
which--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--or
designed
to
burst
in
a
different
way.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
don't
know
how
you
design
a
balloon.
but
there--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--as
i
said,
the
design
claim
in
this
case
was
not
significantly
developed.
perhaps
it
would
help
to
talk
about
the
design
claim
in
horn
v.
thoratec,
for
example,
which
is
another
pma--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--the
labeling
claim
is
that
the
label
was...
inadequately
warned
or
was
misleading
because
although
at
one
place
it
lists
among
12
precautions
not
to
inflate
the
balloon
above
the
rate
of
burst
pressure,
which
was
eight,
at
another
place
it
says
to...
it
has
a
chart
that
shows
inflation
up
to
13
atmosphere,
and
at
another
place
in
the
instructions,
it
says
inflate
to
the
nominal
pressure,
which
is--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--but
the
car
doesn't
come
with
a
chart
that
shows
you
safe
usage
of
up
to
100
miles
either.
and
the
instructions--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--yes.
under
814.39,
medtronic
could
make
changes
to
strengthen
the
warnings
or
clarify
the
instructions
without
prior
approval.
and
there's
one
other
part
of
the
label
that--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--21
cfr
814.39(d).
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
of
course,
it...
i
freely
admit
that
at
trial
if
the
plaintiff
couldn't
articulate
the
design
theory
any
better
than
i
did
here,
the
plaintiff
is
not
going
to
lose
on
the
design
claim.
but
there
are
other
cases
where
there
is
quite
a
clear
theory
about
what
the
design
defect
is.
there
are
cases
where
the
products
have
been
recalled
because
of
a
design
defect;
and
in
those
cases,
could
congress
have
really
intended
to
protect
the
manufacturer
from
liability?
after
all,
the
dalkon
shield
disaster
where
tons
of
people
were
hurt
because...
women
were
killed
and
injured
because
of
a
design
defect,
was
just
infamous
for
the
bill.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
first
of
all,
it's
not
our
position,
justice
souter,
that
only
state
pma's
are
preempted.
california
has
good
manufacturing
practice
requirements
that
were
preempted
to
the
extent
they
were
different
from
or
in
addition
to
the
federal
requirement.
some
states
had
hearing
aid
packaging
requirements.
there
was
a
state
that
had
a
requirement
about
the
grants
of
prescription
glasses,
lenses.
so
it's...
it
is
broader
than
just--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--those
were
specific
requirements
for
devices,
and
they
had
counterparts--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--addressed
specifically
to
devices,
and
they
had--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--direct
federal
counterparts.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
think
that's
what
congress
was
intending.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
think
under--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--yes.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
don't--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--the
holding
of
lohr
didn't
reject
it.
five
justices
disagreed
with
me,
and
i
don't
think
you
need
to
agree
with
me
on
that
point
to
find
for
me
here.
we
talked
about
some
examples
that
justice
ginsburg
offered,
in
which
a
state
common-law
duty
could
become
so
specific
that
it
effectively
imposed
a
state
device
requirement.
i
also
want
to
correct
the
point
that
manufacturers
can't
make
labeling
changes
without
fda
approval.
again,
814.39(d)
allows
them
to
do
so.
and
so
the
catheter's
label,
where
it
says
"inflate
the
balloon
gradually
to
higher
pressure
up
to
the
rated
burst
pressure
or
until
the
stenosis
resolves.
"
the
narrowing
resolves,
to
me
that's
ambiguous
as
to
whether
you
can
go
above
the
rated
burst
pressure.
medtronic
could
have
clarified
that
instruction
without
running
afoul
of
any
fda
regulation.
as
for
the
fda's
current
views,
it
is
not
actually
correct
that
in
lohr
the
government
gave
weight
to
the
fda's
amicus
brief.
the
government
gave
weight
to
the
fda's
regulation,
808.1(d).
that
regulation
is
still
in
effect,
and
it
hasn't
been
modified
since...
since
lohr
was
issued.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
without
prior
approval?
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
814.39(d).
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
after
fda
approved
the
pma,
any
of
the
listed
changes
can
be
placed
into
effect
prior
to
the
receipt
of
a
written
fda
order
approving
the
pma
supplement.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
right.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
yes.
it
says
either
one.
it
doesn't
say
up
to
a
maximum.
there
is
testimony
from
the
doctor
in
this
case
that
he
thought
that
the
label
showed
testing
up
to
13.
and
that
based
on
the
directions,
he
thought
that
going
up
to
10
was
fine
and
that
it
was
standard
use
among
the
cardiologists.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
the
rate
at
burst
pressure,
yeah.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
i
also
want
to
mention...
we
don't
come
to
this
case
on
a
blank
slate.
we
come
to
it
in
light
of
lohr.
the
court
has
already
interpreted
section
360k(a).
in
finding
no
preemption
in
lohr
of
any
of
the
claims,
the
court
looked
to
the
labeling
regulation
801.109
was
applicable
to
the
device
there.
that
is
the
same
exact
regulation
that
is
applicable
to
the
device
here.
if
medtronic's
pma
device
complies
with
801.109,
then
it
is
deemed
to
be
not
misbranded,
but
that
is
a
moving
target.
what
is
adequate
instructions
for
use
changes
as
the
manufacturer
learns
about
use
of
its
product
in
the
real
world.
the
same
process
for
making
design
changes
exists
in
this
case
as
existed
in
lohr.
and
on
the
state
law
side,
we
really
are
talking
about
identical
state
duties
of
care,
which
this
court
said
their
generalities
majority
held
that
the
generality
of
these
duties
left
them
outside
the
category
of
requirements
that
360k
envisioned
to
be
with
respect
to
the
device.
thank
you.
