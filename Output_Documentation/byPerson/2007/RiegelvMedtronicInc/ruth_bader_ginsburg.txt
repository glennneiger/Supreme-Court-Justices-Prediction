and
how
does
it...
how
does
it
compare
with
another
process
that
the
fda
looks
at
very
closely,
i
think
even
more
closely
than
new
devices...
new
drugs.
new
drugs
also
go
through
a
very
long
testing
period.
is
there...
and
the
fda
gives
its
approval,
and
the
drug
is
marketed,
and
it
turns
out
it
has
risks
people
didn't
understand
and
there's
a
tort
suit.
is
there...
is
there
a
defense
to
the
manufacturer,
"i
followed
to
the
letter
the
permission
that
the
fda
gave
me?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
would
certainly
be
at
least
the
same
here,
right?
that
compliance
with
the
federal
law
would
be
a
defense
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
reason...
as
i
understand
it,
tort
suits
are
not
preempted
with
respect
to
new
drugs.
is
there
a
reason
to
treat
the
two
differently?
for
new
medical
devices
and
the
new
drugs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's
the
difference.
so
the
question...
what
does
the
express
preemption
provision
mean?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
take
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--take
a
concrete
situation
where
the
fda
is
asked:
we'd
like
to
make
this
improvement.
and
the
fda
says
no,
we
don't
think
that
enhances
safety.
and
then
there's
a
tort
suit
based
on
the
failure
to
make
that
improvement.
wouldn't
the
fda
rejection
of
permission
to
make
that
improvement...
wouldn't
that
at
least
be
preemptive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
response
was
it
wouldn't
go
to
the
jury
if
the
fda
had
said
no,
you
cannot
make
this,
and
the
plaintiff's
point
is
you
must
make
it
in
order
to
make
this
device
safe.
i
thought
your
answer
to
me
was
that
the
fda
regulation...
the
fda's
action
in
refusing
to
allow
the
change
to
be
made
would
be
preemptive
and
you
wouldn't
give
it
to
a
jury
to
second-guess
that
determination
by
the
fda.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
was
asking
you,
if
it
was...
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
if
the
fda
says...
rejects.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
proposed
change,
can
a
state
court
say,
well,
we
think
the
fda
was
wrong
in
rejecting
that,
so
we're
going
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury.
i
thought
the
question
i
was
posing
to
you
is,
isn't
federal
law
preemptive
in
that
situation,
when
the
fda
says
you
can't
do
it
and
the
personal
injury
lawyer
wants
it
to
convince
the
jury
that
they
had
to
do
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--another
variation...
the
fda
says
you
must
include
x
in
this
device
or
we
won't
give
you
the
pre-market
approval.
and
so
the
manufacturer
puts
x
in,
and
then
there's
a
lawsuit
that
wants
to
charge
that
putting
x
in
made
the
device
dangerous.
would
the
fda's
insistence
that
x
be
put
in
take
x
out
of
any
state
court's
tort
litigation?
that
is,
wouldn't...
if
the
fda
says
you
must
have
it,
a
state
court
couldn't
put
to
a
jury
whether
you
should
have
eliminated
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
label...
that
you're
pressing?
so
you
said
you
really
don't
know
what
the
design
defect
was.
how
about
the
label?
that
would
be
the
other
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why,
mr.
olson,
is
it
more
essential
to
this
scheme
than
the
new
drugs?
i
would
think
that
if
everything
that
you
said
about
new
devices
would
apply
in
bold
letters
to
new
drugs,
because
the
testing
procedures
are
much
longer,
are
they
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there's
an
argument
that
what
it
was
intended
to
do
was
to
cut
out
state
pre-market
approval,
where
states
like
california
came
in
when
there
was
a
federal
void
and
said
we
shouldn't
let
the
manufacturers
put
out
whatever
they'd
like.
let's
have
a
pre-market
approval.
and
the
argument
is,
as
you
well
know,
which
was
presented
in
senator
kennedy's
brief,
that's
what
we
meant
to
do
with
the
preemption
provision.
nothing
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
there...
to...
to
take
care
of
that
kind
of
hypothetical
where
the
fda
says
this
isn't
it,
to
say
that
kind
of
suit
can't
be
brought.
but
it
is,
indeed,
mentioned
that
there's
a
category
of
suits
that
is
simply
saying:
manufacturer,
you
didn't
do
what's
in
that
pre-marketing
approval?
so
we're
kind
of
a
backup
to
not
doing
anything
in
conflict
with
the
fda's
approval.
we're
simply
saying
you
didn't
follow
the
labeling
requirement,
or
you
didn't
follow
the
design
submission
that
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
would
say
the
same
thing
for...
for
design
and
labeling
if
the
manufacturer
did
not
do
what
the
fda
approved?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
what
about
the
argument
that
once
you've
got
this
very
valuable
pre-market
approval,
even
though
you
could
make
that
device
safer,
you
have
no
incentive
to
do
that.
you
have
permission
to
market
this
product
as
is.
even
if
you
know
that
there's
a
better
way
to
do
it,
there's
a
disincentive
to
try
to
go
through
the
process
and
make
the
change.
why
should
you,
when
you
have
carte
blanche
to
continue
without
making
the
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
you
conceded
that
there
would
be
conflict
preemption,
that
the
states
could
not...
either
through
a
state
agency
or
through
a
jury...
come
up
with
a
requirement
that
would
conflict
with
an
fda
requirement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
everybody
agrees
that
far,
that
the
states
were
not
to
be
in
the
business
of
issuing
pma's.
the
question
is
does
the
preemption
clause
mean
any
more
than
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it...
isn't
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
compared
drugs,
which...
i
think
you
will...
you
will
concede...
go
through
a
very
arduous
process,
new
drugs,
why...
maybe
you
think
that
the
same
preemption
applies
there,
although
there's
no
preemption
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
anyone...
when
this
preemption
clause
was
put
in
the
new
medical
device,
did
the
government...
when
was
the
government
change?
was
it
2004?
the
government's
position,
the
fda's
position,
was
180
degrees
different--
