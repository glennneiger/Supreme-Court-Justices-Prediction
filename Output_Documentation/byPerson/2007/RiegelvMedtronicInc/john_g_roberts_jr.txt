chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-179,
riegel
v.
medtronic,
inc..
ms.
zieve.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
situation
addressed
by
the
requirement
that
the
manufacturer
alert
the
fda
to
new
information
and
at
least
file
annual
reports,
and
then
the
fda
can
pull
back
the
pre-market
approval
if
they
think
these
problems
require
it
to
do
so?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
i
thought
that
was
your...
your
theory
was
a
little
more
nuanced.
in
other
words,
they
don't
require
you
to
market
a
particular
catheter.
and
you...
what
i
understood
you
to
be
arguing
is
that
there
may
be
a
better
design
and
that
it
was
negligent
for
the
manufacturer
to
market
a
particular
design,
even
though
they're
allowed
to;
they
don't
have
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
should
have
made
the
change
to
make
it
safer,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
if
that's
what
happens,
what,
as
a...
what's
going
to
happen
for
patients
at
a
time
when
your
theory
comes
up,
the
manufacturer
looks
at
it
and
says,
well,
maybe
this
is
a
better
device;
we
don't
want
to
risk
these
tort
suits,
so
we're
going
to
stop
selling
our
old
device
that's
been
approved,
but
now
we
have
got
to
get
fda
approval
of
the
new
device
and
that
might
take
forever
or
at
least
a
year,
let's
say.
and
what
happens
to
patients
in
that
year?
they've
got
no
device.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
theory
is
that
although
this
device
has
been
approved,
here's
a
better
one.
and
it's
negligent
on
the
manufacturer's
part
to
market
a
device,
even
though
approved
by
the
fda,
when
there's
a
better
one
that
would
reduce
the
risks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
want
them
to
do
if
you
think
it's
negligent
for
them
to
market
the
approved
product?
don't
you
want
them
to
take
it
off
the
market?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
that
it
is
not
reasonably
safe.
it's
that
another
design
would
be
safer.
and
you
think
that's
a
basis
for
negligence
because
you
say,
yeah,
the
fda
approved
it,
but
that
doesn't
mean
they
required
the
manufacturer
to
market
that
device.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that's
just
like
a
car
speedometer.
i
mean,
the
speedometer
goes
up
to
120
miles
an
hour,
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
are
supposed
to
drive
it
that
fast.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
fda
hasn't
done
it?
how
are
newly
discovered
flaws
dealt
with?
i
mean,
say
where
you
have
this
catheter,
and
the
fda
didn't
look
at
the
possibility
of
allergic
reactions
to
the
balloon
plastic,
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
turns
out
to
be
a
serious
problem.
how
can
you
say
that
that's
preemptive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you...
you
agree
that
that
was
not
preemptive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson,
i'm
looking
at
the
government's
brief
on
page
4
which
says
that
in
the
annual
reports,
the...
the
manufacturer
has
to
disclose
unpublished
reports
of
data
from
clinical
investigations
or
nonclinical
laboratory
studies
involving
the
device.
so
presumably
that
includes
any
nonclinical
laboratory
studies
that
the
manufacturer
itself
conducted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
zieve,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
didn't
the
court...
didn't
the
majority
of
the
court
reject
that
line
in
lohr?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
could...
i'm
sorry...
i've
been
thinking
about
your
example
of
ambiguity.
you're
saying
it
is
ambiguous
when
they
say
you
can
inflate
it
up
to
the
bursting
pressure
or
until
the
blockage
is
cleared?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
obvious
mean
if
the
blockage
is
clear,
you
don't
keep
inflating
it
to
the
bursting
pressure.
you
think
that
doctors
read
that
as
saying
you
can
inflate
it
past
the
bursting
pressure
unless...
if
the
blockage
isn't
cleared?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
the
label
said
eight
is
the
bursting
pressure?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
zieve.
the
case
is
submitted.
