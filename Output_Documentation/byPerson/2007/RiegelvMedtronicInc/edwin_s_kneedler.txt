mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
might
be
useful
to
begin
by
focusing
on
the
consequences
of
petitioner's
argument
that
the
pma
approval
of
an
application
does
not
result
in
requirements
that
are
preemptive
for
purposes
of
the
preemptive
provision.
under
petitioner's
view,
the
day
after
the
fda
gave
pma
approval
to
a
particular
device,
state
legislatures
or
state
regulatory
agencies
could
adopt
laws
or
regulations
that
would
direct
the
manufacturer
to
manufacture
or
design
the
product
or
to
give
labeling
that
would
conflict
with
what
the
fda
had
just
approved.
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
could
have
intended
in
enacting
the
express
preemption
provision
here
to
allow
state
regulatory
agencies
or,
even
more
so,
individual
juries
that
could
very
within
a
state--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
we
think
that
the
express
preemption
provision
embodies
that
very
important
conflict,
or
maybe
in
this
context
it
is
best
to
conceptualize
it
as
field
preemption,
of
the
things
that
are
included
within
the
application
that
is
submitted
to
the
fda
and
the
labeling.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
that
is...
that
is
definitely
true.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
that's
entirely
correct,
and
if
i
could
just
elaborate
on
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
what
i
was
going
to
say...
to
elaborate
on
the
point
that
i
made,
petitioner
concedes
that
if
there
is
an
fda
pma
requirement,
the
state
may
not
impose
its
own
pma
requirement;
and
that
has
to
be
correct,
because
in
the
state
pma
approval,
the
state
could
withhold
its
approval
unless
the
manufacturer
changed
the
device
or
changed
the
labeling
in
some
way
to
get
it
cleared
through--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
it's
important
to
understand
why.
congress
was
not
concerned
about
the
pma
in
the
abstract
or
as
a
process;
it
was
concerned
about
what
the
consequences
of
requiring
the
manufacturer
to
go
through
the
pma
process
were.
and
that
was
precisely
because
the
result
of
the
state
pma
process
could
be
to
impose
different
requirements.
the
labeling
should
read
differently--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
product
should
be
differently.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is...
there
is
no
express
preemption
clause
there.
one...
one
possible
explanation
might
be
is
that
a...
that
a
device
is
a
tangible
concrete
item,
an
item
of
commerce
that
is...
that
has
extensive
design
and
planning
and
blueprints
in
a
way
that
a
drug
doesn't
quite
have
that
same...
that
same
characteristic.
i
mean,
like
other...
like
automobiles
or
something,
that
they
have
a
tangible
aspect
and
a
long
lead
time
in
the
design
and
manufacture.
that
may
be
one
explanation
for
why
congress
wanted
to
be
especially
firm
about
imposing
preemption
with
respect
to
federally
approved
devices.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
a
different
congress.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
was
1976
when
we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
they
were
only
addressing
devices
in
that...
these
were
not
general
fda
amendments;
they
were
addressing...
they
were
addressing
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
government
filed
a
brief
in...
in
late
1997
taking
a
position
that
pma
approval
did
not...
did
not
have
preemptive
effect.
that
was
issued
together
with
fda's
issuance
of
a
proposed
rule
to
the
same
effect.
fda
withdrew
that
proposed
rule
7
months
later.
the
government
did
not
address
this
question
again
until
2004
in
the
brief
you're
referring
to
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
due
in
large
part
to
examining
the
very
things
that
i've
been
talking
about,
that
in
fda's
judgment,
which
this
court
in
the
lohr
case
said
was
entitled
to
considerable
deference,
fda
recognized
that
there
would
be
a
serious
undermining
of
fda's
approval
authority
and
its
balancing
of
the
risks
and
benefits,
if
a
state
jury
could
reweigh
those...
the
balance
that
fda
had
struck
in
the
new
medical
device--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
i
mean,
let
me
just
clarify.
if
the...
if
the...
there
are
incident
reports
that...
that
a
manufacturer
is
supposed
to
give
to
fda.
there
is
often
a
difficult
judgment
as
to
whether
the
injury
that
is
associated
with
a
device
is
some
problem
of
the
device
or
whether
it's
some
problem--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
it...
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
it's
possible
that
the
labeling
would
be
regarded
as
misleading
for
some
reason.
in
that
event,
the
manufacturer
should
apply
to...
should
submit
what's
called
a
supplemental
pma
and
request
that
the
labeling
be
changed
to
clarify
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
ordinarily,
yes.
if
there
was...
if
there
was
a
very
serious
risk
to
health
and
safety--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
that
event,
fda
has
variety
of
tools
that
it
can
take
and
so
does
the
manufacturer.
one
of
them
is
what's
sometimes
called
a
360h(a)
of
the
act...
is
a
notification
to
physicians
or
other
users
of
a
product
that
there
may
be
some
previously
unrecognized
problem
or
misrepresentation
or
what
could
be
misconstruction
of
the
label.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
not
subject
it
to
state
tort
liability,
no.
if
there
was...
if
there
was
a
situation
where
the
manufacturer
knew
of
a
serious
problem
and
did
not
report
it
to
it
fda,
that
could
subject
the
manufacturer
to
criminal
penalties
with
respect
to
fda
for
either
misrepresenting
or
withholding
information.
but
that's
really
the
buckman...
this
court's
buckman
decision,
that
that's
the
relationship
between
fda
and
the
manufacturer,
and
that's
the
incentive.
i
think
someone
asked
about
what
incentives
does
the
manufacturer
has.
the
manufacturer
has
a
powerful
incentive
because
of
the
criminal
penalties
and
other
sanctions
that
can
be
taken
by
fda
if...
if
the
manufacturer
does
not
report
something
to
the
fda.
plus,
manufacturers
have
an
important
reputational
interest,
that
they
don't
want
to
be
seen
to
be
flouting
possible
problems.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
if
it
was
just...
i
think
that's
a
good
point.
if
it
was
just
a
question
of
going
through
a
duplicative
state
pma
process--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
also
i
think
the
fda
regulations
promulgated
when
this
was
put
out,
soon
after
the
'76
amendments
were
passed,
i
think
reinforced
the
conclusion
that...
and,
in
fact,
there
was
a
regulation
that
specifically
talks
about
the
application
of
general
adulteration
standards
in
a
way
that
might
require
a
specific
label
change
to
be
made
by
a
manufacturer,
and
we
think
that's
basically
precisely
this
lawsuit.
it's
the
application
of
general
tort
law
that
would
require
the
manufacturer
or
a
standard
of
care
under
common
law
that
would
say
that
what
the
manufacturer
had
done
specifically
approved
by
fda
was...
was
improper
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
we
think
that
that
is
in
the
teeth
of
the
preemption
provision.
i
think
justice
alito
asked
the
question
about
the
issue
of
whether
fda
focused
or
didn't
focus
on
a
particular
aspect
of
the
design.
we
don't
think
that
a
preemption
test
can
really
realistically
turn
on
that.
that
would
require
extensive
and
intrusive
inquiry
into
what
fda
had
done.
we
think
that
the
best
way
to
look
at
this
is
what
the
end
product
was;
what
was
the
application
that
was
finally
approved
and
the
labeling
associated
with
it,
much
like
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
you
look
at
what
was
put
before
the
agency
and
what
was
approved,
not
what
might
have
gone
into...
into
consideration.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you.
