mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
the
key
central
focus
of
this
case
was
touched
upon
by
justice
kennedy's
question.
congress
made
a
decision
that
it
wanted
to
balance
reasonable
safety
and
effectiveness
of
lifesaving
devices
with
the
availability
of
lifesaving
devices
to
the
public.
they
did
so
by
vesting
this
responsibility
in
the
experts,
the
expertise,
the
judgment,
and
the
processes
at
the
fda.
and
preemption
of
potentially
conflicting,
confusing,
and
burdensome
state
law
requirements
is
essential
to
this
scheme.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
they're
similar,
but
they're
also
quite
different,
justice
ginsburg.
the
principal
difference
is
this
preemption
provision
that
is
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case.
section
360k(a)(1),
that
similar
provision
was
not
put
by
congress
in
the
new
drug--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
there
was
such
a
state
pre-market
approval
process,
it
would
be
something
like
the
federal
process
which
would
involve
a
very
detailed
application
which
would
have
everything
about
the
design,
the
manufacture,
and
the
warning
labels
in
it.
then
california
would
come
up
with
different
requirements,
presumably
or
potentially,
than
what
the
fda
had
decided
was
a
reasonable
balance
between
safety
and
effectiveness
and
availability.
and
so
therefore,
there
would
be
different
requirements.
and,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
the
lohr
case,
if
a
state
jury
or
a
state
court
comes
up
with
those
different
requirements,
it
is
the
same
problem:
different
states,
different
requirements
under
different
circumstances.
and
it
would
be
quite
anomalous
for
congress
to
have
given
more
power
to
juries
in
individual
ad
hoc
cases
which
don't
do
the
weighing,
justice
kennedy...
they
can't
do
the
same
amount
of
weighing
because
their
focus--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this
is
a
continuous
process.
information
must
be
given
by
the
manufacturer.
there
is
a
process
by
which
doctors
report
consequences
to
the
fda.
citizens
may
report
information.
this
is
a
continuous
jurisdiction--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
and
let
me
explain
why
i
think
that
is
important
to
this
case.
if
the...
that
information
is
then
in
the
possession
of
the
fda.
the
fda
can
suggest
to
the
manufacturer...
it
can
require
the
recall.
it
can
change
warnings.
it
can
do
all
of
those
things.
but
what
it
is
doing,
because
it's
continuously
involved
in
the
process--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
fda
can
act
as
promptly
or
as
slowly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
dependent
upon
the
manufacturer
providing
information
to
the
one
centralized
agency--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
justice
stevens,
because
in
that
case--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
and
that's
a
judgment
that
congress
made,
because
with
the...
the
manufacturer
then
would
be
violating
the
law,
failing
to
tell
the
fda
what
was
going
on,
perhaps
comitting
fraud,
and
be
subject
to
criminal
penalties,
recall
penalties,
civil
penalties,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
the
choice
is,
justice
stevens,
in
that
situation...
is
to
allow
the
agency
that
has
the
expertise,
that
has
spent
1200
hours
or
so
on
this
particular
device,
according
to
your
opinion
in
the
lohr
case,
to
make
a
judgment
with
respect
to
whether
this
product
should
be
on
the
market
or
not.
because
as
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
the
reason
for
that,
justice
souter,
is
that
someone
must
make
a
judgment.
that...
the
information
that
the
manufacturer
may
have
learned
may
be...
have
some
aspect
of
the
safety
or
effectiveness
of
the
device,
but
it
still
might
be
the
best
product
available.
as
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief,
there
are
some
devices
that
are
used
in
situations
where
a
child
might
die.
there's
a
50-percent
mortality
rate
even
with
using
the
device.
so
there's
got
to
be
individual
judgments
with
respect
to
variations
of
risk
and
safety
and
availability.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
all...
no,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
specifically,
justice
alito.
but
i
do
know...
and
this
is
the
application,
itself,
which
is
not,
unfortunately,
in
the
record,
but
is
available
through
the
fda.
it
goes
into
elaborate
detail
with
respect
to
the
burst
pressures.
this
device...
the
label
on
this
device...
and
that
is
in
the
record
at
a-174
of
the
court
of
appeals
appendix...
specifically
says
it
shouldn't
be
inflated
higher
than
a
burst
pressure
or
atmospheric
risk
pressure
at
8
atmospheres.
this
one
was
inflated
to
10
atmospheres,
notwithstanding
the
label
requirements.
so
what...
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
elaborate
nature...
everything
in
the
label
has
to
be
approved
by
the
fda.
the
safety
indications,
the
precautions,
the
hazards,
the
counter...
counterindications,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
there's
a
professional
judgment
there.
my
colleague
says
that
well,
it's
not
the
fda's
not
imposing
requirements,
because
this
is
a
design
submitted
by
the
manufacturer.
of
course,
it's
a
design
submitted
by
the
manufacturer.
that's
how
devices
are
made.
but
the
fda
examines
every
little
part
of
that
design...
the
way
it's
manufactured,
the
way
it's
labeled,
the
way
it's
marketed,
the
way
it's
going
to
be
used.
and
it
can
say
no,
change
that
part
of
it,
or
have
you
considered
this?
it's
a
dialogue
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
fda.
and
then
when
the
fda
is
satisfied
that
it's
reasonably
safe
and
effective...
and
the
word
"reasonable"
is
important.
nothing
is
perfectly
safe.
you
can
make
a
car
weigh
a
hundred
tons,
and
it
might
be
perfectly
safe,
but
balances
have
to
be
made,
the
same
with
drug
devices.
so--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i
don't
think
you
can.
what
you
can
do,
justice
alito,
is
examine...
and
justice
breyer's
example
of
the
two-inch
versus
one-inch
wire
in
the
lohr
case
is
a
good
example.
the
fda
will
have
examined,
and
presumably
done
its
job,
with
respect
to
every
aspect
of
the
design,
manufacture,
and
labeling
and
marketing
of
the
device.
now,
the
choice
is
between
that...
and
i
think
congress
made
this
judgment
quite
consciously,
because
if
a...
if
a
jury
comes
along
in
a
particular
case,
examining
a
particular
infant
or
a
particular
ill
person
and
the
facts
of
a
particular
situation,
and
says
well,
the
device
should
have
had
a
one-inch
nail...
a
wire,
or
it
should
have
had
a
different
tensile
strength
of
the
balloon,
or
something
like
that,
then
the
manufacturer
is
in
this
dilemma.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
requirements...
now,
it's
no...
there's
no
question
that
there
are
requirements,
because
every
aspect
of
this
approval
incorporates
the
design
and
all
of
those
things.
if
the
manufacturer
fails
to
comply
with
those
requirements,
that's
a
parallel
suit
that
may
be
brought.
now,
in
this
case,
the
negligent
manufacturer...
a
claim
was
made.
it
was
dismissed
on
summary
judgment,
which
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
it.
so--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
was...
we
agree
that
was
not
preempted,
and...
and
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
that
same
conclusion,
but
affirmed
the
district
court
that
dismissed
it
on
summary
judgment
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
now
our...
the
statute,
i
think,
could
not
be
more
clear
with
respect
to
every
aspect
of
what
the
court
talked
about
in
the
lohr
case.
and
i
think
that
the
analysis
that
this
court
articulated
in
the
geier
case
having
to
do
with
the
air
bags,
although
that
was
an
implied
preemption
and
conflict
preemption
case
and
this
is
an
express
preemption
case,
is
very
illustrative.
the
court
went
through
an
analysis
of
what
manufacturers
might
do
if
they
were
required
to
put
an
air
bag
in
the
car
when
the
department
of
transportation
had
decided
that
it
wanted
a
little
bit
of
play
in
the
marketplace
with
respect
to
different
types
of
restraints
of
individuals.
and
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
if
a
trial
court
in
kansas
or
some
other
place
decides
that
cars
must
be
manufactured
in
a
certain
way,
that's
what
would
happen.
and
then
the
judgment
of
the
department
of
transportation,
which
was
considering
all
of
these
things
and
wanting
to
encourage
innovation
with
respect
to
restraints...
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
we
want
in
this
country
for
devices
to
be
as
safe
and
effective
as
they
possibly
can
be.
but
we
don't
want
to
discourage
the
marketing
of
products
that
might
save
our
lives.
and
these
are...
class
3
devices
are
all
in
the
category
of
life-threatening
or
life-saving
devices
here.
so
we
want
those
available.
they
may
not
all
be
perfect.
they
may
work
in
some
situations
and
not
work
in
other
situations,
but
some
expert,
centralized,
that
can
take
into
consideration
all
of
those
factors
should
be
the
place
where
that
decision
is
made.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
the
real
world
answers
that
question.
the
manufacturers
of
these
products
are
always
trying
to
produce
better
products
that
will
be
safer.
they
of
course
have
to
go
through
the
process
to
justify
to
the
experts
at
the
fda
that
they
are
indeed
safe,
or...
and
the
fda
then
may
make
a
judgment
that
the
reasonableness...
if
there
is
a
much
safer
device
that
doesn't
have
the
risks
of
the
previous
device,
they
can...
they
can
withdraw
the
approval
of
the
previous
device.
but
the
fda
may
at
the
same
time
say
well,
this
one
device
might
be
safer
under
some
circumstances
but
less
safe
under
other
circumstances.
it
might
work
in
this
critically
ill
patient,
but
not
in
this
critically
ill
patient.
so
the
marketplace
of
doctors
and
patients
deserves
to
have
more
than
one
product
out
there,
even
though
someone
might
decide
this
one
is
safer
than
the
other
one.
that
is
the
way
congress
made
this
judgment.
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that
there
may
be
marketplace
incentives
and
other
things
that
would
cause
a...
someone
in
the
marketplace
to
say
i
found
a
better
way.
someone
in
the
marketplace
might
say
well,
it
might
be
better,
but
it
might
be
prohibitively
expensive.
there
are
all
kinds
of
those
judgments,
and
i
think
that
illustrates
the
point.
the
fda
is
the
right
place
for
these
decisions
to
be
made
and
this
balancing
process
to
occur,
because
an
individual
ad
hoc...
not
scientifically
trained
jury
that
is
not
required
to
consider
the
consequences
for
the
marketplace
as
a
whole,
cannot
make
those
judgments.
as
conscientious
as
a
jury
might
be,
that
judgment
is
in
for
that
case
and
for
that
patient
and
might
say
well
gee,
it
should
have
been
done
differently
in
this
particular
situation;
a
one-inch
wire
might
have
been
better
in
this
particular
case.
but
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
i
believe
that's
true,
but
i
think
that
was
a
slightly
different
point
than
justice
kennedy's
one;
what
was...
if
it
is
the
same
point,
i
agree
with
you,
that
there
is
an
elaborate
process
of
information
exchange
from
the
manufacturer
and
from
doctors
and
from
all
over
with
respect
to
these
medical
devices.
it's
described
in
considerable
detail
in
about
six
pages
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
the
government's
brief
describes
it
quite
thoroughly
as
well.
that
same
balancing,
the
government
filed
a
brief
last
week
in
this
court
in
the
warner
lambert
case,
that
this
court
will
be
hearing,
i
think
in
january,
which
describes
in
even
greater
detail
than
it
does
in
the
brief
filed
here
about
that
balancing
process
and
the
importance
of
the
centralized--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that...
what
the
chief
justice
was
referring
to
was
an
annual
requirement--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
there
also
are
requirements...
and
i
haven't...
can't
give
you
the
exact
citation,
there's
a
lot
of
subparagraphs
in
these
sections...
with
respect
to
information
that
comes
into
the
possession
of
the
manufacturer
that's
pertinent
to
adverse
consequences
or
effects
of
the
device
that
must
be
given
promptly
to
the
fda.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
think
we
know.
secondly,
there
are
six
of
the
seven
circuits
that
have
considered
this
case,
found
that
those
tort
suits
were
preempted.
so
to
the
degree
to
which
they
are
out
there,
there
is
one
circuit
in
which
they
might--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
did,
and
it...
and
it
learned
from
experience...
the
unique
experience
that
you
described
the
fda
having,
in
your
opinion
in
the
lohr
case,
has
been
brought
to
bear
in
this
case;
and
there's
a
reasoned
explanation
for
the
fda's...
the
government's
position
today,
as
to
why
it
took
one
position
then...
there
were
some
proposed
regulations
that
are
no
longer
on
the
table...
but
there's
a
reasoned
explanation
by
the
agency
that
you
said
and
quite
correctly
in
my
judgment
had
a
unique
experience,
and
unique
capability
of
determining
the
effect
of
take...
state
court
suits
on
the
process
that
it's
involved
in,
and
that's
reflected
in
the
government's
briefs
that
are
filed
in
this
case
just
earlier.
the
fact
is
that
there
are
specific
detailed
requirements
with
respect
to
every
aspect
of
the
device
that's
approved
by
the
fda;
and
any
jury,
just
like
any
regulatory
body,
justice
breyer,
will
impose
a
different
requirement.
the
fundamental
that
you
asked
about,
what's
the
basis
of
this
suit,
there
was
some
answer
to
it,
but
the
fact
is
there's
some
effort
to
explain
why,
if
it
was
designed
according
to
the
approval,
by
the
fda,
that
wasn't
good
enough.
there
was
something
wrong
with
that
design
that
was
approved.
something
wrong
with
that
label
that
was
approved.
and
a
jury
at
the
end
of
the
day
will
be
expected
then
to
render
a
different
requirement
by
saying
you
are
liable
for
damages
because
you
did
it
the
way
the
fda
approved.
that
is
a
state
requirement
which
is
a
counterpart
to
the
federal
requirement,
and
this...
and
congress
made
it
explicitly
clear
that
any
requirement
that
is
different
or
in
addition
to
the
federal
requirement
is
preempted
if
it
has
to
do
with
safety
or
effectiveness
of
the
device.
and
if
juries
require
products
to
be
changed,
they
will
by
definition
be
either
less
safe
or
less
available
than
the
fda
has
determined
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
public
according
to
the
responsibility
vested
in
them
by
congress.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
