mr.
jean-claude
andre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text
of
section
2680(c)
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
establishes...
provision
underlying
purpose
confirm
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
provision
to
broadly
bar
all
claims
arising
out
of
all
the
tensions
of
all
property
by
all
law
enforcement
officers.
as
in
any
statutory
construction
case
we
need
to
of
course
begin
with
the
text,
and
with
respect
to
the
text
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
statutory
language
is
simply
no
different
than
the
statutory
at
issue
at
circuit
city
v.
adams.
circuit
city
v.
adams
this
court
applied
a
ejusdem
generis
to
limit
a
sweepingly
broad
residual
phrase
that
is
meaningfully
indistinguishable
from
the
"any
other
law
enforcement
phrase"
at
issue
here.
in
particular,
in
circuit
city
the
court
was
asked
what
kinds
of
employment
contracts
were
exempted
from
the
mandates
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
particular
provision
at
issue
in
that
case
9
u.s.c.
section
1
exempted
from
the
act's
coverage
any
and
i
quote
contracts
of
employment
of
sea
men,
railroad
employees
or
any
other
class
of
workers
engaged
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce.
that
residual
phrase
read
in
isolation
is
broad
and
sweeping
on
its
face
it
certainly
would
appear
to
apply
not
only
to
transportation
workers,
but
also
to
retail
store
clerks
like
the
respondent
in
circuit
city,
none
the
less
under
a
ejusdem
generis,
this
court
limited
that
residual
phrase
to
just
to
transportation
workers.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
if
i
could
point
out
that
if
the
government
had
made
the
argument
that
you
have
to
have
a
list,
and
i
think
under
the
government's
interpretation
you
had
to
have
at
least
three
items,
two
specific
and
one
general.
in
norfolk...
norfolk
and
western
railway,
this
court
says
that
need
not
be
the
case.
there
the
court
said
that
you
could
have
a
singular
general
term
preceded
by
a
singular
specific
term.
so
it's
our
position
that...
that
even
if
you
were
to
read
this
statute
as...
as
possessing
only
two
items,
that
you
could
still
apply
ejusdem
generis,
but
we
don't
read
the
statute
that
way.
we
believe
that
the
statute
actually
contains
a
list
of
three
items,
and
that
congress
to
save
itself
a
couple
words,
decided
to
say
"any
officer
of
customs
or
excise,
or
any
other
law
enforcement
officer.
"
instead
of
saying
the
more
wordy
version,
"any
officer
of
customs,
any
officer
of
excise
or
any
other
law
enforcement
officer.
"
i
don't
think
we
can
fault
congress
for
its
pick
in
that
scenario.
to
get
back
to
the
residual
phrase,
the
"any
other
law
enforcement
officer
phrase.
"
here,
ripped
from
its
moorings,
as
we
believe
the
government
is
trying
to
do,
would
certainly
seem
to
apply
to
all
law
enforcement
officers,
including
bureau
of
prisons
officials
which
by
statute
are
law
enforcement
officers.
but
section
2680(c)
contains
a
number
of
contextual
cues
that
congress
didn't
have
general
law
enforcement
functions
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
provision.
it
had
customs
and
tax
functions
in
mind.
in
particular,
the
detention
clause
preserves
sovereign
immunity
for
the
detention
of
goods
and
merchandise
by
any
officer
of
customs
or
excise.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
we
believe
it
does,
and
we
believe
that
when
congress
added
that
language
it
was
simply
congress's
sensible
recognition
that
customs
and
tax
officers
will
detain
or
seize
cash
and
real
property
which
wouldn't
be
covered
or
wouldn't
be
subsumed
under
goods
and
merchandise.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
we
actually
don't
think...
or
i
guess
i
cannot
necessarily
agree
with
the
first
part
of
what
you
just
said,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
don't
believe
that...
that
other
property
necessarily,
or
that
"goods
and
merchandise
and
other
property.
"
the
goods
and
merchandise
are
examples
of
"other
property".
we
think
in
that
situation,
goods
and
merchandise
refer
specifically
to
goods
and
merchandise
as...
as
explained
historically
in
the
united
states
code,
which
are,
you
know,
more
movable
things
other
than
cash,
tangible
items
other
than
cash,
and
"other
property"
then
covers
cash
and
real
property.
excuse
me.
getting
back
to
the
contextual
cues
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
the
four
contained
in
the
detention
clause
itself,
the
assessment
clause
contains
four
additional
contextual
cues.
it
preserves
sovereign
immunity
for
the
assessment
of
any
tax
or
the
collection
of
any
customs
duty,
and
because
we
have
this
great
quantity
of
contextual
cues
in
a
very
short
statutory
provision,
we
believe
that
we
would
also
prevail
under
an
application
of
the
noscitur
a
sociis
canon,
that
this
court
most
recently
applied
two
terms
ago
in
dolan
v.
postal
service.
in
that
case
what
was
at
issue
is
whether
the
term
2680(b)
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
reached
all
negligent
transmissions,
in
particular
a
parcel
left
on
the
foot
of
someone's
front
door
that
causes
them
a
fall
injury,
or
instead,
it
was
limited
by
its
antecedent
contextual
cues,
namely...
i'm
sorry...
namely,
loss
and
miscarriage,
which
would
tend
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
really
only
to
preserve
sovereign
immunity
for
instances
in
which
delivery
was
untimely
or
went
to
the
wrong
location.
the
court
again
sensibly
looked
past
the
superficially
broad
negligent
transmission
language
and
instead
said
no,
we
have
to
read
it
in
context;
and
in
context
congress
did
not
intend
us
to
just
pluck
those
two
words
out
of
the
dictionary
and
apply
a
dictionary
meaning.
in
fact,
in
that
case,
the
government
implored
this
court
to
apply
dictionary
definitions
to
negligence
and
transmission,
and
that's
essentially
what
the
government
is
trying
to
ask
this
court
to
do
here.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
we
don't
believe
that
that
changes...
we
don't
believe
that
changes
the
meaning
of
the
detention
cause
at
all
beyond
the
small
change
that
congress
made.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
your
honor--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--well,
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
congress
decided
to
not
only
preserve
the
detention
clause,
but
also
mimic
its
language
in
the
exception
to
the
exception,
means
that
congress
intended
to
kind
of
bring
forward
the...
of
course...
original
meaning
as
of
1946
of
that
clause.
but
i
think
to
get
what
you're
asking
me,
the
government's
position,
that
because
the
exception
to
the
exception
references
any
provision
of
forfeiture...
the
government's
suggestion
that
that
somehow
broadens
the
scope
of
the
statute
is
misplaced.
customs
and
tax
officers
regularly
apply
other
forfeiture
statutes,
and
in
particular
the
one
they
use
a
lot
is
21
u.s.c.
881.
that's
the
general
civil
forfeiture
statute.
and
so
in
many
cases
they
will
bring
a
forfeiture
action
under
either
their
agency's
specific
forfeiture
provision,
or
the
general
21
u.s.c.
881.
and
so
when
congress
included
that
language
saying
any
provision
of
forfeiture,
it
was
simply
congress's
sensible
recognition
that
they
don't--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--there
may
be
more,
i
was
giving
you
an
example,
but
the
one
that
i
gave
you,
21
u.s.c.
881,
is
the
one
most
frequently
used.
it
is
the
general
forfeiture
provision.
it's
kind
of
the
backbone
of
all
forfeitures,
and
so
in
many
cases
officers
bring
forfeiture
actions
not
only
either...
either
under
their
own
agency
forfeiture
provision
or
the
general.
sometimes
they
bring
them
under
both.
but
the
point
is
that's
a
meaty
statute
there,
and
i...
i
assume
that
congress
wanted
to
make
clear
that
if
a
customs
or
tax
officer
were
to
bring
a
forfeiture
proceeding
under
that
meaty
provision,
and
maybe
some
other
ones
that
they
would
use
from
time
to
time,
that
the
exception
to
the
exception
would
still
work
here.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
under
our
interpretation,
if
a
customs
or
tax
officer
or
another
law
enforcement
officer
acting
in
a
custom
or
tax
capacity
detains
property
and
injures
it...
and
it
doesn't
matter
under
which
forfeiture
law
they
detain
the
property--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--and
the
plaintiff
is
ultimately
successful,
i'm
sorry,
i
guess...
yes,
the
plaintiff
is
ultimately
successful
in
defeating
the
government's
claim
for
forfeiture,
then
they
can
sue
under
the
ftca
for
the
damage
to
their
property.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
sure.
the
best
example
that
comes
to
mind
is
pre-9/11
before
the
merger
of
the
ins
and
the
border
patrol...
or
i'm
sorry,
the
customs
bureau...
under
the
department
of
homeland
security.
when
you
drove
across
the
border
before
9/11
more
often
than
not
you
would
see
a
gentleman
or
a
woman
in
a
green
jump
suit.
they
were
ins.
but
not
only
were
they
asking
you
questions
about
your
immigration
status
and
checking
to
see
if
you
had
id;
they
were
also
asking
about
what
you
were
bringing
in...
for
example,
oh,
do
you
have
more
than
two
bottles
of
liquor?
because
you're
only
allowed
to
bring
in
two.
and
if
you
said
yes,
they
would
direct
you
over
to
secondary
inspection,
and
even
there
in
secondary
inspection
certainly
sometimes
there
may
have
been
officers
in
blue
suits,
the
customs
enforcement
officers.
but
more
often
than
not,
they
were
still
officers
in
green
suits,
ins
officers.
and
there
they're
taking
this
extra
property
from
you
because
they
believe
you
are
not
supposed
to
have
it,
and
then
sending
you
on
your
way.
there
are
many
task
forces
in
many
other
instances
in
which
officers
can
overlap
or
share
functions,
postal
inspectors
working
with
the
customs
enforcement
agencies
to
keep--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--right.
we
believe
irs
officers
are
expressly
covered,
but,
for
example,
when
the
fbi
is
conducting
an
investigation
with
the
irs
into
fraud
and
other
tax
issues,
then
we
believe
that
those
fbi
agents
would
be
covered.
so
we
don't
believe
it's
hard
at
all
to
find
a
number
of
examples
of
where
other
law
enforcement
officers
are
assisting
tax
and
customs
officers,
standing
in
the
shoes
of
tax
and
customs
officers,
or
just
doing
something
sufficiently
akin
to
what
tax
and
customs
officers
do.
and--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
the
formula
one
case
out
of
the
second
circuit.
and
the
reason
why
we
relied
on
that
case
is
because
the
dea
agents
were
opening
up
a
shipping
container
that
had
not
yet
been
opened
since
it
came
from
overseas.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
that's
right.
and
we
again
reference
that
case
because
we
wanted
to
offer
the
court
a
broad
construction
or
make
sure
the
court
was
comfortable
in
knowing
that
we
were
comfortable
with
the
"other
law
enforcement
officer"
phrase
being
read
broadly
to
reach
any...
you
know,
any
loose
tax
or
customs
function.
if
the
court
wants
to
construe
that
phrase
more
narrowly,
we
still
win
this
case,
and
we
have
no
problem
if
the
court
wants
to
do
that.
but
we
think
that,
given
that
the
residual
phrase
of
the
detention
clause
starts
out
with
the
word
"any",
the
way
to
give...
to
give
credence
to
congress's
use
of
that
word
is
to
then
construe
the
phrase
as
reaching
conduct
such
as
the
conduct
in
the
formula
one
case.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito,
because
we
weren't
really
prepared
to
debate
what
exactly
"detention"
means.
in
fact,
we
didn't
petition
on
that
issue,
and
my
client
didn't
press
it
below.
but
we
were
just
intuitively
thinking...
i
don't
think
the
word
"detention"
does
much
work
for
us
here,
at
least
in--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--i
agree.
i
should
have
been
more
clear.
we
don't
believe
that
the
word
"detention"
necessarily
sheds
a
lot
of
light
on
how
you
construe
what
"other
law
enforcement
officer"
means,
but
certainly,
yeah,
we
believe
that
if
the
detention
issue
were
alive
in
this
case,
we
have
a
very
strong
case,
because
there's
a
very
passive
kind
of
bailment
here,
as
you
referenced,
where
our...
my
client
was,
you
know,
told
to
leave
his
property
with
a
receiving/discharge
clerk
and
go
to
a
new
institution,
and
the
property
was
going
to
follow
him
along.
there
was
no
seizure.
there
was
no
investigation.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i...
i
don't,
but
i
don't
want
to
resist
you
too
much
either.
you
know,
if
the
court
would
like
us
to
reach
that
issue,
we'd
be
happy
to
brief
if
the
court
wanted
to
issue
an
order
akin
to
the
one
it
issued
last
term
in
u.s.
v.
resendiz-ponce.
and
i
think
to
get
more
directly
to
what
you're
saying,
whatever
congress
intended
as
far
as
other
law
enforcement
officers,
the
fact
that
we
have
a
case
here
where,
again,
there
is
this
very
passive
bailment
by
a
bureau
of
prisons
receiving/discharge
clerk,
i
think
exemplifies
how
the
government's
construction
of
the
statute
is
too
broad.
and
i
think
that
might
be
what
you
were
trying
to
tease
out
of
me
there.
and
to
get
back
to
the
government's
construction,
we
believe
that
their
construction
would
render
a
number
of
words
in
this
statute
superfluous,
which
is
sort
of
our
third
textual
reason
for
reading
the
statute
our
way.
the
detention
clause
contains
a
total
of
22
words.
under
the
government's
construction
it
would
simply
read:
"any
detention
of
any
property
by
any
law
enforcement
officer.
"
fourteen
words
would
be
excised
right
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
there
certainly
are
some
cases
that
would
appear
to
go
both
ways,
although
i
think
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
cases
cited
by
the
government,
those
cases
involve
pretty...
i
realize
we
have
an
unclear,
bizarre
statute
here
as
well,
but
those
are
pretty
bizarre
statutes
the
government
is
relying
on
where
the
court
has,
and
more
often
than
not,
it
has
also
been
as
an
alternative
statement,
you
could
even
say
possibly
dicta,
where
the
court
has
said,
oh,
congress
can
give
examples.
but
more
often
than
not,
the
court
applies
the
ejustem
generis
canon
and
the
noscitur
a
sociis
canon
to
confine
or
limit
a
superficially
broad
residual
phrase.
and
if
that
weren't
the
case,
then
gutierrez
v.
ada
would
have
come
out
the
other
way,
dolan
v.
postal
service,
of
course,
circuit
city.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
that's
true.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
the
statute
that
we
have
in
that
case.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
as
kind
of
a
practical
matter,
we
don't
think
that
when
you
have
a
statute
like
this,
the
word
"any"
really
does
a
lot
of
work.
i
mean
if
you
had
taken
out
the
word
"any"
and
instead
pluralized
the
word
"officer",
i
don't
think
the
statute
really
would
work
any
differently.
but
even
taking...
taking
as
true
this
court's
oft-repeated
statement
that
dea
officers,
enforcement
of
drug
laws,
but
they
are
doing
it
akin
to
customs
laws.
and
again,
the
court
need
not
adopt
that
construction
for
us
to
prevail
in
this
case.
but
that's
how
we
believe
that
our
construction
is
faithful
to
the
word
"any"
to
the
extent
that
in
this
statute
it's
relevant
at
all.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
absolutely.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
my
client
was
pro
se
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
he
didn't
raise
it
there.
and
to
be...
again,
we
didn't
think
that
the
issue
of
whether
a
detention
had
to
be
a
seizure,
something
more
forceful,
or
whether
it
was
so
broad
as
to
include
more
of
a
passive
bailment
like
we
have
here,
we
didn't
believe
that
that
issue
had
percolated
enough
in
the
courts
of
appeals
to
warrant
petitioning
on.
so
we
figured
we'd
fight
this
fight
here
today.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
absolutely.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
if
there
was
not
a
detention
or
if
the
bop
guard
was
not
an
any
other
law
enforcement,
we
would
win
under
either
two
of
those
independent
analyses.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
that's
exactly
right.
and
that's
why
we
believe
that
the
rule
against
superfluity
is
another
reason
why
our
construction
is
more
faithful
to
congress's
intent
in
this
case.
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
we
also
believe
that
the
legislative
history
underlying
purposes
for
this
particular
provision
support
our
reading.
in
particular,
i
realize
the
legislative
history
is
pretty
sparse,
but
in
particular,
there
were
six
congressional
committee
reports
issued
by
congress
after
the
detention
clause
was
expanded
to
essentially
its
current
form.
and
in
all
six
of
those
reports,
congress
conspicuously
omitted
to
make
any
reference
to
the
fact
that
this
phrase
could
possibly
reach
the
detentions
of
all
property
by
all
law
enforcement
officers.
now,
we're
not
suggesting
that
this
case
is
at
all
like
arlington
v.
murphy,
for
example,
where
we
are
going
to
have
legislative
history
try
to
overrule
a
clear
statutory
text.
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
this
text
is
ambiguous,
and
so
legislative
history
is
relevant
to
give
that
text
meaning.
and
so
the
reason
why
we
focus
here
on
those
particular
committee
reports
is,
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
stated,
the
committee
reports
are
the
most
helpful
form
of
legislative
history
because
when
many
members
of
congress
go
up
to
vote,
they
haven't
parsed
particular
provisions
in
the
text;
they
rely
on
the
committee
reports,
the
reports
prepared
by
the
committee
that
marked
up
and
presented
the
language
to
the
floor.
and
so,
if
when
all
those
members--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--no.
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
when
those
members
typically
go
up
to
the
floor
and
vote,
they
oftentimes
don't
parse
the
language.
they
rely
on
the
committee
reports.
and
so
if
the
government's
construction
were
correct
here,
essentially
what
you
would
have
is
all
of
those
members'
votes
being
overridden
because
they
couldn't
possibly
have
known...
unless
they
took
the
time
to
parse
the
text
and
we
all
know
that
a
lot
of
times
they
don't...
they
wouldn't
possibly
know
that
there'd
be
any
chance
whatsoever
that
this
phrase
could
broadly
reach
the
detention
of
property
by
all
law
enforcement
officers.
even
putting
that
kind
of
legislative
history
argument
aside,
i
think
we're...
our
strongest
footing,
when
we
talk
about
how
our
construction
is
faithful
to
congress's
underlying
purpose
for
this
particular
provision,
on
three
occasions,
this
court
has
either
suggested
or
expressly
stated
that
the
purpose
for
this
particular
provision
was
to
avoid
the
creation
of
a
redundant
federally
funded
remedy.
as
we
explain
in
our
opening
brief,
there
was
a
pre-existing
federally
funded
remedy
only
for
the
negligent
conduct
of
tax
and
customs
officers.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
we
believe
it
would
if...
well,
actually
that's
a
very
good
question.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
right.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
right,
but
then
in
that
situation,
once
the
united
states
substituted,
they
could
seek
dismissal
because
the
westfall
act
doesn't
override
any
exceptions
to
the
ftca.
so,
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
in
that
particular
case,
if
you're
dealing
with
an
officer
of
customs
or
tax
or
another
law
enforcement
acting
in
that
capacity,
and
they
were
sued
personally
for
the
negligent
handling
of
property,
the
government
could
certify
they're
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment,
step
into
the
case,
and
then
move
to
dismiss
under
this
provision,
under
2680(c).
but,
historically,
there
was...
before
the
westfall
act,
there
was
a
pre-existing
federally
funded
remedy
for
only
officers
acting
in
a
tax
or
customs
capacity
or
customs
or
tax
officers
by
name.
and
so
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
congress's
underlying
purpose
to
avoid
creating
a
duplicative
remedy
to
apply
its
provisions
so
broadly
because
congress
wanted
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
claims
against
law
enforcement
officers
other
than
those
against
whom
a
cause
of
action
was
already
available.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
well,
as
i
mentioned,
this
court
suggested
in
kosak
that
that
was
the
only
only
purpose,
but
then
in
hatzlachh
and
in
gutierrez
v.
martinez,
this
court
twice
stated
that
that
was
the
only
purpose,
and
the
court
did
so
for
good
reason.
again,
although
the
legislative
history
is
sparse,
the
only
statements
whatsoever
in
the
legislative
record
about
the
purpose
for
this
particular
provision
was
that
congress
was
intending
to
avoid
creating
a
duplicative
remedy.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
and
it's
also
based
on
the
testimony
of
colonel
o.r.
mcguire,
who
is
general
counsel
for
the
comptroller
general.
and
it
wasn't
just
judge...
well,
judge
holtzoff
was
probably
the
architect
of
the
detention
clause
and
maybe
this
entire
provision.
it
was
the
comptroller
general's
office,
and
judge
holtzoff
who
jointly
were
responsible
for
preparing
tort
claims
legislation.
so,
essentially,
of
the
two
people
who
were
most
relevant
to
the
preparation
of
the
ftca,
and
granted
we're
talking
15
years
before
its
actual
enactment,
but
two
people
who
were
most
important
for
preparing
this
tort
claims
legislation,
they
both
agreed
that
the
only
purpose
for
this
particular
provision
was
to
avoid
creating
a
redundant
remedy.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
i'd
like
to
first
address
the
government's
resistance
to
making
any
concession
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
first
of
all,
if
the
statutory
language
in
this
case
was
so
clear,
then
so
must
the
statutory
language
in
circuit
city.
the
language
had
started
out
with
the
words
"any
other",
and
clearly
then
were
followed
by
words
that
have
a
very
plain
meaning
out
of
context,
"any
worker
engaged
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
"
we
just
don't
believe
that
the
government's
position
that
the
statute
is
unambiguous
can
be
squared
with
that
case.
nor
do
we
think
as
a
factual
matter
that
the
statute
is
unambiguous.
in
particular,
we
think
it
would
have
been
strange
for
this
court
in
kosak
to
go
out
of
its
way
in
a
footnote
and
expressly
decline
to
resolve
today's
question
presented
if
the
detention
of
property
clause,
in
particular
the
"law
enforcement
officer"
phrase,
had
only
one
clear
meaning.
and
then
on
top
of
that,
as
we
noted
in
our
reply
brief,
five
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
our
construction;
two
other
circuit
judges
have
written
separately.
the
total
is
16
circuit
judges
that
have
found
our
position
to
be
credible,
found
the
statute
to
be
ambiguous,
applied
the
canons
of
construction
that
we
are
urging
the
court
to
apply
today,
and
then
resolved
the
case
in
our
favor
so
if,
if
the
statute
is
truly
unambiguous,
then
those
16
circuit
judges
not
only
got
this
issue
wrong,
they
got
it
very
wrong.
justice
breyer,
i
unfortunately
don't
have
an
example
either
of
what
other
types
of
law
enforcement
officers
were
out
there
at
the
time
of
the
ftca's
enactment,
but
i
do
have
one
example,
and
that
would
be
the
elliott
ness
and
the
al
capone
investigation.
elliott
ness
was
in
charge
of
running
a
group
of...
in
charge
of
supervising
a
group
of
government
agents
who
were
part
of
the
department
of
justice,
even
though
elliott
ness
himself
was
a
treasury
agent.
and
they
were
all
trying
enforce
the
volstead
act,
but...
to
get
al
capone
on
charges
of
income
tax
evasion.
and
so
we
believe
that
that's
a
nice
example
from
the
early
1930s
when
judge
holtzoff
drafted
this
language
that
shows
that
you
could
have
a
revenue
officer
working
with...
in
fact,
supervising
other
law
enforcement
officers,
and
they
are
all
really
doing
the
same
thing.
as
far
as
the
policy
considerations
are
concerned,
we
believe
that
the
government's
reliance
on
the
two
other
general
purposes
for
the
ftca
exceptions
just
prove
too
much.
pretty
much
any
governmental
function
is
important.
and
so
the
government
in
every
brief
they
filed
on
this
issue
below
and
in
pretty
much
every
ftca
exception
case
that
we've
seen
has
come
in
and
said,
oh,
but
our
interests
are
served
by
these
two
other
purposes,
and
therefore,
this
statutory
exemption
has
to
be
construed
narrowly.
again,
as
a
factual
matter,
we
don't
think
that
their
concerns
are
really
all
that
well
founded,
in
any
event.
true,
there
were
12,000
administrative
claims
filed
by
federal
prisoners
over
the
last
three
years.
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
footnote
12
of
our
cert
petition,
there
were
only
16
cases
filed
in
all
of
2006
by
federal
prisoners
under
this
statute.
settlement
process
is
working,
and
that
also
federal
prisoners
are
just
not
bringing
suit
and
there
is
a
very
good
reason
for.
that
it's
the
federal
filing
fee.
that's
$455.
my
client's
claim
in
this
case
is
$177.
prisoners
don't
evaluate
whether
to
sue
based
on
some
sophisticated
reading
of
sovereign
immunity
doctrines
and
ambiguous
statutory
text.
they,
you
know,
they
think
about
their
wallet.
they
make
$2.50
a
day,
and
it's
just
not
worth
it
for
them
to
risk--
mr.
jean-claude
andre
--even
if
a
prisoner
gets
ifp
status,
they
still
have
to
pay
the
full
filing
fee.
the
ifp
status
only
allows
them
to
pay
in
installments.
so
it's
debited
off
their
account.
so
they
still
make
a
very
real
calculation
when
they
decide
whether
to
sue
based
on
how
much
is
at
stake
and
how
much
is
it
going
to
cost
me.
mr.
jean-claude
andre
that's
correct.
there
was
$177
at
stake
and
so
perhaps
my
client
shouldn't
have
sued
because
it
didn't
make
a
lot
of
sense,
although
he
also
did
file
the
suit
a
couple
years
earlier
when
the
filing
fee
was
lower.
but
in
our
experience,
prisoners
they
are
not
going
to
typically
sue
for
these
kinds
of
claims.
this
is
nothing
like
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
problem
we
had
in
jones
v.
bock,
where
there
are
24,000
cases
coming
before
the
federal
courts
every
year.
that's
just
not
something
we
envisioned.
so
we
don't
think
that
adopting
any
one
of
the
four
constructions
discussed
are
debated
between
my
friend
and
justice
souter
would
somehow
open
up
the
floodgates
here
and
lead
to
a
lot
of
prisoners
suing
under
this
particular
provision.
thank
you.
