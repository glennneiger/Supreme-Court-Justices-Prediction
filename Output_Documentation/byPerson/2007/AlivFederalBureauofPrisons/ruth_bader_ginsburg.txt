did
you
say
irs
officers,
because
they
would
be
covered?
it's
tax
and
customs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
gave
an
example
in
your
brief
that
didn't
seem
to
fit.
i
mean
you
spoke
of
a
dea
agent
who
was
searching
for
narcotics,
and
that
sounds
to
me
like
what
dea
agents
do.
they
were
not
auxiliary
to
a
customs
officer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were
doing
it
for
their
primary
business,
which
was
to
detect
narcotics.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
still
exist
after
the
westfall
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
now,
the...
there
wouldn't
be...
the
united
states
would
be
substituted--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
the
agent's
abuses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wasn't
it
federally
funded?
i
thought
there
was
a
provision
for
indemnification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
a
difference
with
mr.
andre
on
the
extent
to
which
other
law
enforcement
officers
assist
customs
and
revenue
agents.
in
your
brief
you
say
that's
a
rare
occurrence.
and
mr.
andre
says
oh
no,
it's
quite
common.
so
which
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know
your
time
is
running
out,
but
i
would
like
you
also
to
say
a
word
about
what
remedy,
if
any,
does
ali
have
when
you're
saying
he
had
his
prayer
rug
and
koran,
and
the
government
lost
them
and
he
didn't
get
any
compensation?
does
he
have
any
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
court...
there's
no
court
role
in
that
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
they
have
ifp
status?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
there
wasn't
that
much
at
stake.
