justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
petitioner's
personal
property
was
allegedly
lost
when
he
transferred
or
when
he
was
transferred
from
one
prison
facility
to
another.
after
exhausting
his
administrative
remedies,
petitioner
sued
the
bureau
of
prisons
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
seeking
$177,
the
value
of
the
property.
the
federal
tort
claims
act
waives
sovereign
immunity
for
torts
committed
by
federal
employees,
however,
congress
accepted
from
this
waiver
claims
arising
in
respect
of
the
detention
of
any
property
by
any
officer
of
customs
or
excise
or
any
other
law
enforcement
officer.
the
district
court
held
that
petitioner's
claim
fell
within
this
exemption
and
dismissed
his
claim.
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
agreeing
that
the
exemption
is
not
limited
to
law
enforcement
officers
enforcing
customs
or
excise
laws.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
text
and
structure
of
section
2680(c)
are
most
naturally
read
to
encompass
all
law
enforcement
officers
regardless
of
whether
they
are
enforcing
customs
or
excise
laws.
congress'
use
of
the
expansive
word
“any”
to
modify
other
law
enforcement
officer
and
it's
omission
of
any
restrictive
language
demonstrate
that
it
intended
the
exemption
to
apply
to
law
enforcement
officers
of
whatever
kind.
to
be
sure,
the
clause
preserves
immunity
for
claims
arising
from
officers
enforcing
tax
or
customs
laws.
but
the
text
also
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
preserve
immunity
for
property
detentions
claims
like
the
one
at
issue
here,
and
there
is
no
textual
basis
for
limiting
that
immunity
to
officers
enforcing
certain
kinds
of
laws.
recent
amendments
to
section
2680(c)
support
our
conclusion
because
the
amended
statute
is
more
consistent
and
coherent
if
it
is
read
to
cover
all
law
enforcement
officers.
against
this
textual
and
structural
evidence,
petitioner
appeals
the
canons
of
statutory
construction,
but
those
canons
cannot
be
invoked
to
clarify
ambiguity
where
the
statutes
suggest
none.
instead,
we
must
give
effect
to
the
text
that
congress
enacted.
section
2680(c)
forecloses
lawsuits
against
the
united
states
for
the
unlawful
detention
of
property
by
any,
not
just
some
law
enforcement
officers.
