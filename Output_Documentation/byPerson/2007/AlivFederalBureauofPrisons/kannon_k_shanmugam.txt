mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
2680(c)
preserves
the
government's
immunity
against
tort
claims
concerning
the
detention
of
property
by
any
law
enforcement
officer.
that
reading
is
consistent
not
only
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
but
also
with
congress's
underlying
policy
objectives
in
creating
the
ftca's
exception.
petitioner
effectively
asks
this
court
to
engraft
language
on
to
the
statute
by
adding
the
amorphous
limitation
"acting
in
a
customs
or
tax
capacity.
"
to
the
unambiguous
statutory
phrase
"any
other
law
enforcement
officer".
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes,
i
think
that's
correct
with
one
caveat,
justice
souter,
and
i
don't
mean
to
quibble,
but
i
think
that
this
is
important.
i
think
when
one
looks
at
the
evolution
of
the
statute,
it
may
very
well
have
that
when
judge
holtzoff
drafted
the
relevant
statutory
language,
he
started
with
customs
or
excise
officers
because
the
british
bill
that
was
apparently
the
model
for
the
detention
of
property
clause--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--used
that
phrase,
and
he
may
then
have
decided
to
expand
it
to
other
law
enforcement
officers
simply
because
he
concluded
that
there
was
no
basis
for
treating
other
law
enforcement
officers
differently.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
so--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--justice
souter,
it
is
certainly
true
that
congress
could
have
written
that
statute
that
way
and
indeed
could
have
omitted
the
customs
or
excise
officers
entirely,
and
that
certainly
would
be
a
clearer
statute
in
the
sense
that
i
don't
think
that
mr.
andre
would
be
here
if
we
had
a
statute
that
simply
referred
to
any
law
enforcement
officer.
but
the
united
states
code
is
replete
with
provisions
that
fit
this
model,
that
start
with
specific
examples
and
then
contain
a
general
residual
clause.
and,
indeed,
even
the
constitution
has
similar
provisions.
to
take
one
concrete
example
that
we
cite
among
the
many
examples
in
footnote
11
of
our
brief,
the
extradition
clause
in
article
iv
of
the
constitution
refers
to
extradition
for
treason,
felonies,
and
other
crimes,
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
framers
could
have
simply
referred
to
crimes,
but
they
cited
those
examples.
as
this
court
held
in
a
case
way
back
when,
kentucky
v.
denyson,
the
reason
that
congress
used
those
examples
was
for
emphasis
to
make
clear
that
political
crimes
such
as
treason
and
other
felonies
that
would
qualify
as
political
crimes
were
covered.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
so--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
assuming
for
present
purposes,
justice
scalia,
that
the
dog
here
is
any
officer
of
customs
or
excise,
i
think
that
the
critical
point
is
that
the
tail
was
indeed
smaller
than
it
would
be
today
because
customs
and
excise
officers
were
among
the
most
important
federal
law
enforcement
officers.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--you
know--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
we
believe,
first
of
all,
that
if
one
looks
at
this
court's
decision
in
kosak,
the
court
did
not
in
any
way
suggest
that
the
availability
of
alternative
remedies
was
the
sole
purpose--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--justice
stevens,
it
certainly
was
one
of
congress's
primary
purposes
in
creating
the
exceptions
generally,
but
we
do
believe
that
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
serves
that
purpose,
albeit
to
a
lesser
extent
perhaps
than
it
serves
the
other
congressional
purposes,
but
that
was--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
it
did
serve
that
purpose,
justice
stevens,
because
there
was
an
alternative
remedy,
albeit
one
that
was
not
federally
funded
and
that
was
a
common-law
action
against
a
law
enforcement
officer
in
his
personal
capacity
for
negligence.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
there
was
a
provision
for
indemnification
for
revenue
officers
and
other
officers
essentially
acting
in
a
revenue
capacity,
i
believe
that
the
exact
statutory
language
was
"collectors
and
other
revenue
officers"...
and
that
indemnification
provision,
to
be
sure,
would
not
have
applied
to
garden
variety
law
enforcement
officers.
but
in
looking
at
the
availability
of
alternative
remedies,
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
whether
that
congressional
purpose
is
served
somehow
turns
on
whether
the
money
came
directly
from
an
officer
or
whether
it
came
from
the
federal
fisc.
and
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
cites
dolan
for
that
proposition
but
whether
the
alternative
remedy
was
federally
funded
was
simply
not
at
issue
in
dolan.
at
most
the
court
concluded
that
the
alternative
remedy
available
there
was
insufficient.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--it's
very
difficult
to
quantify,
justice
breyer,
but
i
do
think
we
have
some
sense
historically
of
the
state
of
play
at
various
law
enforcement
agencies;
and
the
fbi
was
in
a
relatively
nascent
stage
in
1946.
i
think
the
fbi
dates
from
approximately
the
turn
of
the
20th
century.
certainly
the
bureau
of
prisons,
while
it
existed,
was
detaining
far
fewer
people
than
it
does
now.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
it
did.
to
be
sure,
but
there
were
not--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--yeah.
i
don't
have
exact
numbers.
i
attempted
to
find
them
out.
but--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
can't
offer
you
a
ballpark,
but
i
think
what
i
can
say,
and
this
accords
with
observations
that
various
members
of
this
court
have
made
over
the
years,
is
that
there
were
simply
far
fewer
federal
criminal
provisions
then
than
there
are
now,
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we've
really
seen
an
explosion
in
the
number
of
these
cases
as
time
has
gone
on,
while
the
ftca--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
they
may
very
well--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--he
did
testify
before
one
of
the
committees.
he
did
not
address
this
specific
issue,
but
as
this
court--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--15
years
before
it
was
passed,
judge
holtzoff
wrote
this
report,
and
as
both
the
majority
and
justice
stevens
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
kosak
observed,
there
was
no
evidence
that
this
report
was
even
introduced
into
the
legislative
record.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes.
i
want
to--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
wanted
simply
to
make
the
point
that
in
the
pantheon
of
legislative
history
sources
for
those
members
of
the
court
who
are
interested
in
legislative
history,
we
recognized
that
the
holtzoff
report
should
not
be
afforded
great
weight.
but
that
having
been
said,
i
want
to
address
directly
the
language
you
cite
from
the
holtzoff
report,
because
i
believe
that
that
language
if
anything
supports
our
position,
and
not
petitioners,
because
in
the
relevant
sentence
of
the
holtzoff
report,
judge
holtzoff
wrote
that
the
additional
proviso,
meaning
the
detention
of
property
clause,
has
special
reference
to
the
detention
of
imported
goods
in
appraisers'
warehouses
or
customs
houses
as
well
as
seizures
by
law
enforcement
officials,
internal
revenue
officers
and
the
like.
now
petitioner--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
one
could
make
the
argument
that
that
legislative
history
is
itself
ambiguous;
and
indeed
the
d.c.
circuit
in
adopting
petitioner's
construction
itself
acknowledged
that
at
best,
the
legislative
history
was
as
unclear
as
the
statute.
all
i
mean
to
suggest
is
that
petitioner
does
not
have
available
to
him
any
sort
of
ejusdem
generis
argument
in
construing
that
sentence.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
with
all
respect,
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
very
much
of
a
conclusion
can
be
drawn
from
the
legislative
history
one
way
or
another.
we
have
this
language
from
the
holtzoff
report
which
i
admit,
you
know,
could
be
susceptible
to
the
same
sorts
of
arguments
that
petitioner
is
making
with
regard
to
what
we
feel
is
the
unambiguous
language
of
the
statute.
but
other
than
that
the
only
thing
that
my
friend
has
mr.
andre
has
cited
are
these
summaries
in
various
congressional
reports
which
essentially
summarize
in
shorthand,
often
in
a
single
sentence,
all
of
the
proposed
exceptions
in
the
ftca;
and
none
of
those
summaries
so
much
as
refers
to
the
"and
any
other
law
enforcement
officer.
"
language
at
all.
in
fact,
some
of
the
summaries
on
which
petitioner
relies
do
not
even
cite
the
detention
of
property
exception
at
all.
so
this
is,
in
our
view,
a
case
in
which
at
most,
the
legislative
history
is
simply
silent.
and
we
are
left,
i
think,
and
indeed
we
should
start
with
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
we
have
the
unambiguous
phrase
"or
any
other
law
enforcement
officer.
"
in
this
case.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
we
do
believe
that
it
is
a
rare
occurrence,
but
in
some
sense,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
depends
on
exactly
what
it
is
that
petitioner
means
when
he
says
that
an
officer
is
acting
in
a
customs
or
tax
capacity.
and
with
the
court's
leave,
i'd
like
to
offer
at
least
three
possible
explanations
for
what
that
means
and
then
explain
why
each
of
them
would
be
an
erroneous
interpretation
for
this
court
to
adopt,
and
each
of
these
three
explanations
i
should
add,
appear
at
various
points
in
petitioner's
brief.
the
first
is
that
an
officer
is
acting
in
a
customs
or
tax
capacity
when
the
officer
is
actually
acting
in
a
revenue
collecting
capacity.
and
we
believe
that
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
that
limitation,
there
really
are
no
actual
cases
of
which
we
are
aware
that
would
fall
within
that
language.
and
indeed,
it
would
cast
some
doubt
on
the
meaning
of
the
preceding
phrase
"any
officer
of
customs
or
excise.
"
because
one
might
very
well
wonder
whether
under
petitioner's
construction
that
phrase
should
also
be
limited
to
a
revenue
collecting
capacity.
the
second
possible
explanation
is
that
an
officer
is
acting
in
a
customs
or
tax
capacity
when
the
officer
is
more
generally
acting
to
enforce
the
customs
or
tax
laws,
that
is
to
say,
the
provisions
of
title
19
or
26
of
the
united
states
code.
but
we
believe
that
that
interpretation,
too,
would
suffer
from
the
same
two
deficiencies
that
i've
already
identified
and
would
also
suffer
from
a
third,
namely,
to
the
extent
that
petitioner
relies
for
his
noscitur
a
sociis
argument
on
the
assessment
of
taxes
clause,
that
limitation
would
actually
sweep
more
broadly
than
the
mere
assessment
of
taxes.
so
the
third
possible
interpretation
and
the
one
that
we're
left
with,
i
think,
is
that
an
officer
is
acting
in
a
customs
or
tax
capacity
whenever
the
officer
is
actually
performing
a
function
that
is
performed
by
customs
or
excise
internal
revenue
officers.
but
if
anything,
that
limitation
would
exclude
only
a
very
small
number
of
cases
apart
from
cases
in
the
prison
context
such
as
this
one,
because
as
petitioner
himself
recognizes,
customs
officers
have
virtually
plenary
authority
to
enforce
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
united
states
code.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
all
customs
officers,
by
statute,
have
law-enforcement
authority,
and
that
is
under,
i
believe,
19
u.s.c.
1589(a).
now,
to
be
sure,
there
are
people
employed
by
the
customs
service,
now
ice
and
cbp
components
of
the
department
of
homeland
security,
who
wouldn't
qualify
as
customs
officers.
there
are
secretaries
and
other
people
employed
there
that
don't
that
statutory
definition.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
they
typically
would
be,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
examples
in
which
they
would
not
be,
because
customs
officers
are
the
vast
majority
of
people
who
are
employed
by
the
various
customs-related
agencies.
and
the
same
is
true,
i
would
note,
with
regard
to
internal
revenue
officers.
one
of
the
oddities
of
this
statute
is
that
judge
holtzoff,
rather
than
using
the
known
term
"internal
revenue
officer",
actually
used
this
phrase
"officer
of
excise",
seemingly
borrowing
from
the
british
bill.
and
we
believe
that,
at
most,
that
phrase
would
have
to
refer
to
an
internal
revenue
officer
acting
in
an
excise-collecting
capacity.
but,
to
the
extent
that
"excise
officer"
has
a
narrower
meaning
than
"internal
revenue
officer",
we
believe
that
that
actually
supports
our
construction,
because
it
would
have
been
quite
peculiar
for
judge
holtzoff
and
congress
to
have
referred
only
to
an
excise
officer
and
not
to
an
internal
revenue
officer
if
they
had
meant
to
limit
the
residual
phrase
"any
other
law-enforcement
officer"
to
officers
acting
in
a
customs
or
tax
capacity.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
wish
that
i
could
point
to
such
a
book,
justice
breyer.
i
know
that,
in
doing
my
own
research,
what
i
did
was
simply
to
go
on
the
internet
and
go
to
the
website's
of
various
federal
law-enforcement
agencies
and
try
to
get
a
sense
of
when
they
were
established.
but,
unfortunately,
as
i
said
earlier,
i
was
just
unable
to
obtain
any
numbers
as
to
how
much
officers
these
various
agencies
had,
and
the
like.
but
i
think
that,
more
broadly,
certainly
congress
knew
what
the
phrase
"any
other
law
enforcement
officer"
meant.
and
judge
holtzoff
proposed
this
language
in
what
would
become
the
bill
that
was
introduced
in
december
of
1931.
the
ftca
was,
of
course,
ultimately
enacted
in
1946,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
difficulties
in
attempting
to
look
to
this
legislative
history,
which,
as
i
say,
we
believe
is
silent,
is
that
you're
talking
about,
you
know,
a
number
of
congresses
over
many
years.
and,
to
be
sure,
this
court
has
looked
to
these
same
legislative
history
sources
in
prior
decisions
construing
the
ftca.
but,
you
know,
i
do
think
that
we
are
left
with
the
plain
language
here.
and
we
are
also
left
with
congress's
underlying
policy
objectives,
and
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
other
two
policy
objectives
on
which
this
court
relied
in
kosak
which--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
justice
souter,
i
think,
with
no
disrespect
to
the
good
law-enforcement
officers
of
new
hampshire,
that
these
cases
come
up
far
more
rarely
in
the
federal
context,
because
both
customs
officers
and
internal
revenue
officers
are
law-enforcement
officers
who
have,
i
think,
quite
a
refined
capability.
they
carry
weapons,
and
they
are,
i
think,
usually
very
well
prepared
to
kill
if--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--there
certainly
might
very
well
be
cases
in
which
they
would
feel
the
need
to
call
in
the
fbi
or
other
law-enforcement
agencies.
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
telling
that
in
the
60-year
history
of
the
ftca
there
don't
appear
to
be
any
cases
that
fall
into
that
category.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
there
are
quite
a
few
cases
more
generally.
i
think
that
there
are
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
17
prior
decisions
in
the
courts
of
appeals
alone
involving
these
fact
patterns
or
similar
ones.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
over
the
60-year
period
of
the
enactment
of
the
ftca.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
but
our
fundamental
submission,
justice
souter,
is
that
there
is
no
good
textual
reason
for
confining
the
phrase
"any
other
law-enforcement
officer",
because
that
phrase,
in
our
view,
is
unambiguous.
and,
notably,
petitioner
in
his
brief
and
at
oral
argument
does
not
directly
contend
that
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
that
phrase,
itself.
and
this
court
has
noted,
in
applying
both
the
noscitur
a
sociis
and
the
ejusdem
generis
canons
of
construction,
that
where
the
relevant
phrase
to
which
a
limiting
construction
is
being
applied
is
itself
unambiguous,
that
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
don't
believe
that
that's
correct,
justice
souter,
and
the
reason
that
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
correct
is
because
this
court
has
suggested
that
the
starting
point
is
the
relevant
phrase
that
is
being
interpreted.
and
here
we
have
the
phrase
"any
other
law
enforcement-officer".
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
no,
justice
souter.
i
think
that
where
the
phrase
is
unambiguous,
this
court
has
suggested
that
the
inquiry
is
at
an
end,
and,
to
take
an
example--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
let
me--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--let
me
try
to
explain
to
you
why
you
should
make
that
assumption,
and
it
is
because
congress
here
used
the
word
"any".
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
noted
that
where
congress
uses
the
word
"any",
it
is
substantial
evidence
that
congress
intends
a
phrase
to
be
construed
broadly.
and
this
court
has
specifically
refused
to
apply
the
ejusdem
generis
canon
to
phrases
introduced
by
the
word
"any"
on
precisely
the
ground
i
cite,
namely,
because
they
conclude
that
that
phrase
is
unambiguous.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
we
wouldn't
be
taking
the
words
out
of
the
statute,
because
we
do
believe--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--they
add
nothing
to
the
text
of
the
statute
in
the
sense
that
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
to
refer
to
any
law-enforcement
officer.
that
is
certainly
true.
that
is
also
true
with
regard
to
all
of
the
statutes
and
constitutional
provisions
that
we
cite
in
footnote
11
of
our
brief.
and,
indeed,
in
some
sense,
it
would
be
true
with
regard
to
petitioner's
proposed
construction
insofar
as
congress
could
easily
have
written
a
statute
that
simply
referred
to
any
law-enforcement
officer
acting
in
a
customs
or
tax
capacity.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i'm
certainly
referring
to
the
"any"
that
modifies
"any
other
law
enforcement
officer".
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
that's
right.
and
contrary--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that's
right.
and
contrary
to
mr.
andre's
submission,
this
court
has
made
precisely
that
point
in
harrison
v.
ppg
industries,
in
which
the
court
was
construing
a
similar
phrase
that
referred
to
"any
other
final
action
by
an
epa
administrator.
"
and
that
came
after
a
series
of
specific
final
actions
to
which
the
statute
referred.
and
the
court
actually
said,
in
so
many
words,
it
might
be
different
if
the
word
"any"
were
omitted,
but
we
believe
that
the
inclusion
of
"any"
renders
that
phrase
unambiguous.
and
i
would
note
as
well,
justice
souter,
that
in
your
dissenting
opinion
to
be
sure
in
circuit
city
in
footnote
2,
you
cited
all
of
these
very
cases
on
which
i'm
relying
now
in
support
of
your
proffered
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
i
think...
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
they
are
on
point
to
our
construction
as
well.
but
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
underlying
policy
objectives
here--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--sure,
justice
ginsburg.
and
the
answer
is,
yes,
that
he
does.
he
does
have
an
administrative
remedy.
and
i'd
like
to
say
just
a
couple
of
things
about
the
available
administrative
remedies.
first
of
all,
any
claimant
who
claims
that
a
federal
agency,
including
a
federal
law
enforcement
agency
negligently
damaged
his
or
her
property,
would
have
a
claim
under
31
u.s.c.
3723
for
up
to
$1,000.
that
statute,
which
we
cite
in
a
footnote,
i
believe
in
our
brief,
would
cover
the
vast
majority
of
claims
involving
the
bureau
of
prisons.
there's
actually
another
federal
statute,
31
u.s.c.
3724,
which
provides
a
further
remedy
against
the
department
of
justice
for
up
to
$50,000
for
personal
injury
or
property
damage
caused
by
a
law
enforcement
officer.
and
critically,
that
statute
expressly
makes
clear
that
it
applies
where
the
ftca
does
not.
and
so
that
administrative
remedy
would
be
fully
available.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
there
is
no
court
role
in
that
process,
but
the
bureau
of
prisons
routinely
processes
these
administrative
claims.
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
there
were
12,000
such
claims
over
the
last
three
years.
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
procedures
for
processing
those
claims.
it
paid
out
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
1,100
of
those
claims.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
alter
those
procedures
if
the
court
were
to
hold
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
judicial
remedy.
indeed,
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
paid
out
on
such
claims
even
in
circuits
that
have
adopted
our
interpretation.
i
do
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
underlying
policy
considerations,
because
to
the
extent
that
members
of
the
court
feel
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
we
believe
that
they
strongly
support
our
construction.
in
kosak,
this
court
analyzed
two
other
policy
considerations
in
addition
to
the
avoidance
of
duplicative
remedies:
first,
protecting
important
government
functions
from
the
threat
of
suit;
and
second,
avoiding
exposure
to
fraudulent
claims.
and
we
believe
that
those
concerns
are
particularly
implicated
in
the
prison
context
which
constitutes
the
mine
run
of
cases
in
this
area.
thank
you
very
much.
