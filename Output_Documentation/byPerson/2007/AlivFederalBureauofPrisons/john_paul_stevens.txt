paul

may
i
ask,
following
up
on
justice
alito's
question,
has
there
ever
been
a
debate
in
earlier
stages
in
this
litigation
as
to
whether
this
was
a
detention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
it
were
not
a
detention,
then
you'd
win.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
why
you
didn't
make
the
argument
somewhere
along
the
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
clear...
there
are
so
many
exceptions
from
exceptions
from
exceptions,
that
you
get
a
little
mixed
up,
but
i
am
clear,
am
i
not,
that
if
it
were
not
a
detention,
you
would
win?
justice
john
paul
stevens
everybody
agrees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
also
not
clear
that
under
the
government's...
i
guess
i
should
ask
them,
but
i
got
it
right
in
front
of
me
now...
if
you
deleted
the
words
"officer
of
customs
or
exercise
or
any
other.
"
if
you
just
took
those
words
out
of
the
statute,
it
would
then
mean
exactly
what
the
government
contends
it
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but...
but
a
short
time
ago
you
said
there
was
no
basis
for
distinguishing
between
excise
officers
and
all
other
law
enforcement
officers.
but
there
was
indeed
a
basis
for
it,
namely
that
there
was
an
alternative
remedy
for
people
specifically
named
in
the
statute,
which
is
not
true
of
all
other
officers.
it's
true
now,
but
it
wasn't
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
but
that
is
a
reason
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
all
others
and
this
particular
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't
serve
that
purpose
before
2000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
talking
about
the
use
of
the
word
"any"
all
by
itself.
here
it
says
"any
officer
or
customs
or
excise
or
other.
"
--"or
other",
and
you
would
just
take
those
words
out
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
believe
they
add
nothing
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
