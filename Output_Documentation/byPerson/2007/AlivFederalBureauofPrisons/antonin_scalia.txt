justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
what
do
you
do
about
the
later...
the
later
statute
that
makes
an
exception
to
the
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
it
clearly,
the
exception
to
the
exception
says
that...
that
the
exception
is
applicable
to
any
claim
based
on
injury
or
loss
of
goods
or
merchandise,
if
among
other
requirements,
the
property
was
seized
for
the
purpose
of
forfeiture
under
any
provision
of
federal
law
providing
for
the
forfeiture
of
property.
now
that's
more
than
customs
and
tax...
any
provision
of
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
need
that
exception
to
the
exception
if
the
exception
doesn't
cover
anything
except
customs
and
tax
in
the
first
place?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't...
they
didn't
need
that
if
indeed
it
covered
all
seizures
by...
by
customs
and
tax
officers
and
nobody
else.
if
that's
all
it...
it
covered,
what...
you
know,
this
doesn't
achieve
anything.
the
purpose
of
under
any
provision
of
federal
law.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
envisions
seizure
under
laws
other
than
tax
and
customs.
now
you're
saying
there
is
one,
one
such
law
that
tax
and
customs
officers
sometimes
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
work
does
it
do?
what
work
under
your
interpretation
does
that
later
provision
do,
if
property
was
seized
for
the
purpose
of
forfeiture
under
any
provision
of
federal
law
providing
for
the
forfeiture
of
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
also--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
also
not
entirely
clear
what...
whether
it's
a
tail
or
not.
it
depends
on
what
the
dog
is.
if
you
can...
if
you
were
trying
to
identify
the
most
common
instances,
especially
at
the
time
this
provision
was
enacted,
the
most
common
instances
in
which
property
was
detained
by
the
government,
i
mean
you
know,
later...
later
forfeiture
provisions
are
numerous,
but
at
that
time
i
think
they
were
relatively
few.
i
think
the
dog
would
have
been...
would
have
been
customs
and
excise
officers.
and
the
"or
other
officers"
would
have
picked
up
probably
very
little
real...
real
instances
of
property
detention.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
the
members
of
congress
who
voted
on
this
language,
when
it
was
presented
to
them,
did
they
even
know
who
judge
holtzoff
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
testify
to
this
effect
before
one
of
the
committees?
justice
antonin
scalia
15
years
before
it
was
passed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
two
"anys"
here.
i'm
not
sure
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--any
other.
so
it
says
any
goods
by
any
officer
of
customs
or
excise,
or
if
it
just
had
said
"other
law
enforcement
officer",
you
might...
you
might
disregard
the
force
of
any
because
it
was
way
back
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
repeat
"or
any
other
law
enforcement"--
