could
we
interpret
the
term
"law
enforcement"...
"any
other
law
enforcement
officer"
to
be
limited
to
those
law
enforcement
officers
whose
duties
generally
include
the
detention
of
goods?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
doesn't
it?
it's
not
clear
to
me.
maybe
this
is
not
within
the
question,
but
why
were
your
client's
goods
detained?
"detention"
seems
to
connote
holding
the
goods
against
the
wishes
of
the
owner,
and
that
wasn't
the
situation
here.
he
gave
those
goods...
he
gave
them
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
officer
for
the
purpose
of
having
them
sent
on
to
his
new
prison.

alito,

well,
you
don't
think
that
concept
sheds
light
on
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
referred
to
any
other
federal
law
enforcement
officer?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
we
know...
how
do
we
know
that
that's
the
only
purpose
of
this
exception?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
all
based
on
judge
holtzoff's
testimony?
that's
the
basis
for
the
conclusion
that
this
is
the
only
purpose
for
this
exception?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
all
customs
and
excise
officers
law
enforcement
officers?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
there
other
circumstances
in
which,
let's
say,
goods
are
being
shipped
into
the
country,
and
the...
the
shipment
is
detained
by
someone
who
is
not
a
law-enforcement
officer,
at
least
under
the
definition
in
subsection
(h),
someone
who
has
the
power
to
execute
searches,
seize
evidence,
and
make
arrests?
