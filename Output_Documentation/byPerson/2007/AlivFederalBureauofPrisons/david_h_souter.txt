justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
andre,
it
may
be
that
things
would
fall
into
place
easier
if
you
would
give
us
an
example
or
examples
of
instances
in
which
any
other
law
enforcement
officer
would
be
engaged
in
detaining
property
in...
in
the
course
of
enforcing
customs
or
excise
laws.
if
we
can
understand
that,
then
we
are
going
to
have
a
better
sense
of
how
the
exception
might
work.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
the
other
law
enforcement
officer
engaged
in
customs
excise?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
shanmugam,
may
i
ask
you...
this
goes
to
your
ambiguity
point.
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
if
congress
wanted
to
cover
all
law
officers,
the
only
reason
for
mentioning
the
customs
and
excise
people
would
be
to
make
it
very
clear
that
they
were
within
that
category
of
all
law
enforcement
officers,
and
i
take
it
that's
basically
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
wouldn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
wouldn't
the
way
to
do
that
would
have
made
it
at
least
clearer
that
that's
what
congress
or
what
he
had
in
mind
and
what
congress
was
getting
at
would
have
been
to
provide
that
the...
that
the
exception
referred
to
law
enforcement
officers
including
an
officer
or
customs
of
excise?
in
other
words,
they
would
have
made
it
clear
that
at
that
point,
the
old
historical
customs
and
excise
rule
was
sort
of
the
tail
on
the
dog,
and
the
dog
was
law
enforcement
officers.
instead,
however,
the
order
is
exactly
different.
on
what
your
reading
is...
on
your
reading,
what
is
now
the
tail
of
the
dog
comes
first,
and
the
general
clause
"law
enforcement
officer"
comes
second.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
number
one,
it
is
less
clear
and
it
really
raises
the
question:
weren't
they
trying
to
get
simply
at
law
enforcement
officers
who
were
doing
the
customs
and
excise
function?
so
my
question
is,
why
doesn't
the
order
of
the
words
cut
against
you
by
putting,
on
your
theory,
the
tail
of
the
dog
before
the
dog?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
shanmugam,
before
you
get
into
policy,
may
i
just
suggest
that
there
is
a
possible
fourth
category,
really.
you
had
mentioned
three,
and
one...
a
fourth
possibility
might
be
"law-enforcement
officer",
in
a
very
broad
sense
of
the
term,
but
one
who
is
simply
providing,
let's
say,
protective
service
in
aid
ultimately
of
the
revenue
laws.
and
the
reason
i
have
thought
of
this
is
that
this
sort
of
situation
went
on
in
my...
my
native
state
in
this
past
month,
in
which
the
united
states
marshal
service,
which
at
the
time
all
of
these
statutes
were
enacted
was
a
fairly
large
agency,
took
control
of
some
real
estate
in...
in
new
hampshire
which
had
been
the
property,
or
was
the
property,
of
tax
protesters.
and
they...
they
held
custody
of
that.
they
took
control
of
that
real
estate
for
about
a
week
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
booby
traps
and
bombs
that...
that
would...
that
would
blow
up
the
irs
people
when
they
went
in
there
to
enforce
their
tax
liens.
that
would
be
an
example
of
"law-enforcement
officer"
in
a
very
broad
sense.
it
could
cover
the
marshal
service,
the
fbi,
and
whatnot;
and,
yet,
the...
and
no.
2,
they
would
be
exercising,
you
know,
typical
law-enforcement
functions,
protective
functions.
and,
yet,
they
would
be
doing
so
in...
in
aid
of...
of
the
tax
or
the
revenue
laws.
that
would
be
a
plausible
reason
for...
for
sticking
in
the
general
phrase,
and
it
would
be
a
plausible
reading
of
the
phrase,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
irs
agents
have...
have
expertise
in...
bomb
detection
and
dismantling?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
don't
seem
to
be
many
cases
because...
i
mean
that's
why
we've
got
this
one
at
this
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
over
what
period
of
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean
that's
not...
that's
not
a
deluge
of
litigation.
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
there
is
reason
to
assume
that
no
matter
what
reading
we
give
it,
there
is
a
plausible
reading
that
can
come
up
that...
that
confines
the
actual
application
of
the
"other
law-enforcement
officer"
fairly
narrowly.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
question
of
what
is...
what
is
ambiguous
or
not
is...
is
a
question
of
context.
and
if
you
take
the
phrase
"law-enforcement
officer",
and
you
say
is
that
ambiguous,
and
you
say
well,
gee,
no.
but
if
you
stick
it
in
this
particular
statute
and
it
happens
to
follow
these
specific
references
to
tax
gatherers
and
tax
and
excise
laws,
then
it
seems
to
me
it's
fair
to
say
it
does
become
ambiguous,
because
it
gives
rise
to
a
reasonable
question.
were
they
just
getting
at
law-enforcement
officers
who
were
performing
these
kinds
of
functions,
or
did
they
really
mean
it
as
broadly
as
the
phrase
in
real
isolation
would
have
meant?
that's
ambiguity,
and
that's
what
we've
got
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
then
you
are
saying,
don't
read
the
statute
as
a
whole.
that
argument,
in
effect,
is
saying
isolate
the
phrase...
and
we
don't
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
agree
with
you.
and
if
i
make
the
assumption
that
it's
unambiguous,
your
argument
is
unassailable.
but
if
i
don't
make
that
assumption,
then
your
argument
risks
circularity.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
my
suggestion
is
that
it
is
the
context
that
makes
your
argument
a
tough
sell.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
were
on
point
for
my
dissent.
i
know.
[laughter]
