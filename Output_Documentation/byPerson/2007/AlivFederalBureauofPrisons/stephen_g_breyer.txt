do
you
actually
have
any
information
about
the
early
1940s,
about
who
was
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer?
i
think
the
fbi,
the
bureau
of
prisons...
there
were
a
lot
of
people
being
detained.
there
were
goods
that
were
having
to
do
with
contraband,
foreign
goods,
maybe
domestic,
things
you
weren't
supposed
to
have,
food
stamps.
illegal
rations...
opa...
i
mean,
you
know,
there
were,
you
were
only
supposed
to
have
so
much
food.
have
we
any
notion
who
other
law
enforcement
officers
might
have
applied
to
at
that
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
the
fbi
had
quite
a
big
job
in
world
war
ii.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
fbi
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
do
we
know?
i'm
getting
from
you
that
you
don't
know
and
i
don't
know.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't
even
have
a
ballpark.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
well
that
might
be.
but
i'm
sitting
in
congress,
i
read
this
statute,
i
think
maybe
they
were
talking
about
customs
people
and
the
like.
now,
there
is
this
other
word
in
there,
that's
true.
so
we
look
up,
where
does
the
other
word
come
from?
the
other
word
comes
from
judge
holtzoff.
he
explained
it,
we
don't
have
to
guess.
we
can
read
his
explanation.
his
explanation
comes
in
a
paragraph
having
to
do
with
customs
and
excise,
and
beginning
with,
i'm
talking
about
customs
and
excise,
and
the
additional
proviso
as
special
reference,
where
they
use
this
phrase,
and
then
he
says
it's
all
supposed
to
be
like
the
crown
proceedings
committee
in
england
in
1927,
which
in
fact
had
nothing
to
do
with
anybody
but
customs
and
excise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
if
it
was
not...
i
mean,
i
would
suspect
at
that
time
judge
holtzoff
was
a
pretty
well
known
person
in
the
legal
community
and
i
would
suspected
if
we
are
guessing
at
such
a
thing
that
quite
a
few
did
know
who
he
was.
and
i
suspect
that
when
congress
passes
a
technical
bill,
they
are
interested
in
the
views
of
the
department
of
justice
and
these
were
those
views.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
we
are
going
to
play
a
magic
game
that
we
don't
pay
attention
to
what
sheds
light
on
it,
fine,
then
we
don't,
but
i
would.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
think
in
reading
that,
i
think
that's
a
good
point.
my
actual
reading
of
it,
of
that
paragraph
2,
is
that
it's
not
free
of
ambiguity.
i
completely
agree
with
you.
and
if
i
read
through
it,
then
i'm
making
up
my
mind
as
a
judge,
well,
how
do
i
feel
about
what
these
words
likely
show
and
how
people
in
congress
would
have
interpreted
that
kind
of
reference
or
statement
in
testimony
by
a
person
who
thought
this?
free
of
ambiguity,
i
agree
with
you,
it
isn't.
but
it
might
cut
somewhat
more
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
than
the
respondents.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you...
have
you
found
any...
any
research
on
that?
i
mean
i
think
that's
a
very
interesting
point
that...
that...
have
you
found
any
book
i
could
look
at
or
report
that...
that
would
cast
some
light
on
whether
at
that
time,
1946,
the
phrase
"other
law
enforcement
officers"
referred
to
a
large
number
of
people
who
had
a
lot
of
different
tasks
that
had
not
much
to
do
with
customs
or
excise?
if
so,
this
would
be
an
odd
way
of
sneaking
them
into
the
bill.
that's
who
it
would
look
like.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
were
just
a
few
of
them,
well,
then,
the
bill,
at
worst,
is
a
little
bit
more
than
somebody
might
have
thought;
and
it
would
appear
perfectly
normal
to
a
legislator.
so
is...
is
there
anything
to
look
at?
