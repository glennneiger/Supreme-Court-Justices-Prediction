we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-9130
ali
versus
federal
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
andre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
there
is
a
difference
between
a
sufficient
laundry
list
in
a
residual
phrase
and
example
in
a
residual
phrase.
in
circuit
city
you
have
a
couple
of
examples...
seamen,
railroad
workers...
here
it's
just
a
customs
or
excise
worker.
i
regard
customs
and
excise
as
kind
of
the
same
thing.
so
why
isn't
it
more
like
the
cases
where
we've
said
you
have
an
example
in
a
residual
phrase;
the
example
is
not
limiting.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
not
just
goods
or
merchandise.
goods,
merchandise
or
other
property.
and
does
other
property
include
any
type
of
property?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
"goods
and
merchandise
or
other
property.
"
are
just
examples,
and
then
a
residual
phrase
that
includes
everything;
but
"customs
or
excise
or
any
other
law
enforcement
officer.
"
that's
subject
to
ejusdem
generis...
all
in
the
same
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but,
i
mean
that's
always
true
when
you
have
an
example
and
a
more
general
phrase.
and
yet
our
cases
indicate
that
we
often
read
the
language
that
way.
in
other
words,
it's
giving
you,
perhaps,
the
most
common
example
in
which
you're
going
to
have
a
detention
of
goods,
but
it's
not
limiting
it
to
those
officers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
s.d.
marine
wouldn't
have
come
out
the
other
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
that
an
obscure
statute
in
s.d.
marine?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
the
word,
as
your
brother
argues,
doesn't
"any"
cut
against
you?
if
they
intended
the
other
law
enforcement
officer
to
be
limited
to
similar
to
customs
or
excise,
it
seems
to
me
they
wouldn't
have
thrown
in
"any
other
law
enforcement
officer".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
president
doesn't
rely
on
those
when
he
signs
the
statute
into
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
andre.
mr.
shanmugam.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
legislative
history
about
what
judge
holtzoff
meant
by
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shanmugam.
mr.
andre,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
andre.
the
case
is
submitted.
