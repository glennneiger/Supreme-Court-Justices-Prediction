mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
federal
law
controls
the
retroactivity
or
non-retroactivity
of
new
constitutional
rulings.
this
court
determines
the
constitutional
requirements--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
i
think
in
this...
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
the
retroactivity
area
that
retroactivity
is
a
question
of
the
substantive
constitutional
standard
that
will
applies
to
a
specific
defendant.
i
think
the
court's
cases
from
payne,
griffith,
yates--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
this
is
a
matter
of
remedy.
this
court,
for
example,
in
reynoldsville
casket
wrote
that
teague
itself
is
not
a
limitation
on
remedy.
what
it
is,
is
a
limitation
on
the
principle
of
retroactivity
itself.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
point
is
that
the
substantive
rights
and
retroactivity
are
not
two
different
things.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
two
points:
first
of
all,
i
think
griffith
is
very
clear,
that
finality
is
that
point.
griffith
is
very
clear,
and
it
defines
finality
as
that
point
when
the
direct
appellate
process
has
run,
and
this
court...
and
the
opportunity
to
petition
this
court
for
review
is
over.
secondly,
banks
ii,
a
retroactivity
case
from
this
court,
says
that
it's
up
to
the
federal
courts
to
define
finality.
remember
in
banks
ii
there
was
a
question
of
whether
the
pennsylvania
courts
passing
on
waiver
requirements
somehow
destroyed
the
finality
of--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
given
the
varied
proceedings
at
the
state
level,
that...
that
is
inevitable
no
matter
what
time
this
court--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
the
point
in
griffith
is
that
in
terms
of
uniformity,
this
is...
in
terms
of
providing
similarly
situated
people,
the
best
the
court
can
do
in
this
area
is
to
cut...
to
make
the
point
at
finality--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--and--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--which,
your
honor,
is
griffith
and
is
defined
by
federal
law.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
i
think
the
point...
this
isn't
blackstone...
blackstone
is
not
the
only
view
here.
the
point
is
that
finality
is...
is
not
a
competing
concern,
but
the
point--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor...
and
that
point
is...
the
point
of
finality
is
a
recognized
point
of
what
is
necessary
for
the
integrity
of
judicial
decision-making.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
as
justice
harlan
said
in
the...
in
the
williams
and
mackey
dissents,
there
is...
a
decision
that
is
always
subject
to
revision
is
really
the
functional
equivalent
of
no
decision
at
all.
it's
what
makes
judicial
decisions
judicial.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
the
state's
interest
here
can
be
vindicated
by
the
state
by
applying
state
law.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
i'm
here
representing
the
state
of
minnesota,
and
the
intrusion
that
i'm
concerned
about
in
this
case
is
a
state
court
judge
adopting
some
federal
optional...
sort
of
federal
requirement,
and
applying
it
as
opposed
to
using
state
law
that
can
be
reviewed
and
overturned
and
for
which
that
state
court
judge
is
accountable
to
the
citizenry
of
the
state.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
i
think
that
it's
difficult.
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
the
recent
case
in
minnesota,
krasky,
dealing
with
essentially
the
same
evidence
that's
at
issue
in
this
case,
if
the
state
was
adopting
krasky
as
some
state
standard,
then
this
court
wouldn't
be
in
a
position
to
review
it.
if
it's
adopting
krasky
as
a...
as
the
federal
standard,
then
the
question
is,
how
is
it
that
the
state
is
adopting
something
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
constitution
that
is
not
a
federal
constitutional
requirement?
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
the
point
i
think
is
that
this
is
a
point
that
griffith
makes,
that
when
your
conviction
becomes
final,
that
your
stake...
if
i
can
call
it
that...
in
changes
in
the
law
come
to
a
close.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
i
think
that,
in
terms
of
teague
as
a
remedial
limitation,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
this
court's
retroactivity
jurisprudence
at
all
supports
that
notion.
i
also
think,
for
example,
while
certainly
not
directly
at
issue
in
the
habeas
area,
in
construing
habeas,
this
court
said
that
teague
was
not
so
much
about
a
standard
of
review
as
it
was
about
the
standard
that
applies
itself.
and
so
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
square
the
notion
of
teague
as
a
remedial
limitation
with
this
court's
retroactivity
jurisprudence.
it's
also
difficult
to
square
it
with
the
explicit
rejection
of
that
notion
in
american
trucking
and
in
harper
and
reynoldsville
casket.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
certainly
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
going
on
in
teague.
but,
respectfully,
i
think
the
question...
it's
every
bit
as
intrusive
on
the
state
process
when
a
state
court
judge
applies
a
new
federal
rule
to
overturn
a
conviction,
as
it
is
when
a
federal
court
judge
does
the
same
thing.
in
other
words,
those
comity
concerns
apply
regardless
of
forum.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
look
at
justice
harlan's
writing
in
teague
about
the
post-conviction...
what
should
be
the
rule
for
post-conviction,
you
see
he
lays
out
very
eloquently
what
those
concerns
are
in
terms
of
finality
and
uniformity
in
the
post-conviction
arena.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
those
concerns...
certainly
comity
is
a
concern;
but
those
other
concerns
in
terms
of
finality
and
allocation
of
judicial
scarce
criminal
justice
resources
and
what
kind
of
a
trial
are
you
going
to
have
11
years
after
the
fact,
is
it
going
to
be
more
fair
than
the
trial
that
occurred
in
the
first
place,
all
of
those...
apply.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
think
the
state
court
is
in
a
business...
is
in
a
different
role
in
terms
of
enforcing
the
constitutional
rights
in
that
situation.
in
fact,
as
it
relates
to
the
constitutional
right,
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
state
interest
a
judge
should
be
vindicating
at
that
point.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
that
brings
me
back
to
the
point
where
i
started,
which
is
that
the
constitution
doesn't...
remember,
we're
using
the
federal
constitution
here
as
authority
to
do
something
that,
for
example,
in
this
case
the
minnesota
court
would
be
otherwise
unable
to
do.
this
defendant
never
raised
the
state
law
claim.
under...
never
had...
this
defendant
never
raised
his
state
confrontation
rights.
so
in
this
proceeding,
the
minnesota
court
would
bar
him
from
raising
his
confrontation--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
my
point
is
that
the
state
can
take...
the
state
can
do
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
problem
is
with
allowing
the
state
to
extend
the
federal
standards
here,
is
that
the
federal
standards
under
teague
and
under
griffith,
but
mainly
griffith
and
wharton
together
in
this
case,
defines
what
the
constitutional
requirement...
what
constitutional
standard
this--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
let
me--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--let
me
try
the
first
question,
and
then
we
will
see
where
we
go.
i
think
the
source
of...
the
authority
for
teague
is,
frankly,
the
same
source
for
authority
as
it
is
for
griffith,
and
as
the
same
source
of
authority
as
in
griffith.
griffith
talks
about...
the
best
i
can
do
for
that
is
griffith
talks
about
it
being
grounded
on
basic
norms
of
constitutional
adjudication
and
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
decision
making.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
i
disagree
in
terms
of
that
that
all
applies
only
in
the
federal
system.
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
the
civil
cases,
american
trucking,
reynoldsville,
and
harper,
they
talked
about
that
same
basic
norms
of
constitutional
adjudication
applying
in
the
state
forum
as
well.
i'm
sorry.
there
was
a
second
part
to
your
question
which
was
in
terms
of
congress
being
able
to
amend
or
modify
teague
in
some
fashion?
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
what's
going
on
in
the
federal
habeas
statute.
i
think
this
court
has
said
that--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
i
guess
my
source
of
confusion
with
your
question
is
i
don't
understand
teague
is
a
rule
from
congress.
i
understand
teague
is
a
rule
of
this
court
in
terms...
describing
what
the
constitution...
what
constitutional
standard
applies
to
what
defendant.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
that's
where
the
point
of
agreement
is.
i
think
teague
does
many
things,
but
one
of
the
things
teague
does...
and,
frankly,
not
just
teague,
the
whole
retroactivity
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
griffith
and
teague
together
set
up
a
coherent
whole.
griffith
pre-finality.
teague
post-finality.
and
the
process
of
this
court
saying,
you
this
defendant
enjoy
this
substantive
federal
right,
you
this
defendant
enjoy
this
substantive
federal
right
that
was
active
at
the
time
your
conviction
became
final--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
i
think
what...
the
problem
with
it
is
in
the
constitutional
design
itself.
in
terms
of
the
constitution
provides
requirements.
you
don't
have
to
get
into
teague.
griffith
and
wharton
together,
wharton
saying
teague
exceptions
don't
apply
to
crawford,
those
two
cases
together
basically
say
the
state's
requirement
to
provide
this
new
constitutional
rule
ended
when
this
defendant's
conviction
became
final.
at
that
point,
that
is
the
constitutional
requirement.
the
constitutional
design
then
is
that
states
are
not
free
as
a
matter
of
federal
authority
to
exceed
that
requirement.
they
may
not
rely
on
federal
authority
to
do
that.
just
the
same...
they
can
certainly
do
it
as
a
matter
of
their
own
authority.
but
the
constitution,
for
example,
this
defendant
having
waived
his
state
claims,
having
not
raised
them,
the
constitution
doesn't
allow
the
state
of
minnesota--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
i
think
that
if
that
remedy
is
grounded
in
state
laws,
the
state
of
minnesota
could
certainly
do
that.
but
i
don't
think
they
can
rely
on
the
federal
constitution
to
fire
any
officer
who
does
that.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
probably
yes,
and
the
reason
is
different,
though.
the
reason
is
the
states...
we're
not
changing
the
rights
that
the
person
is
entitled
to.
what
we
are...
what
you're
changing...
that
is...
that
is
the
remedy-and-right
question
again.
and...
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
what
teague...
griffith
and
lorton
together
say
that
this
person's
constitutional
right,
the
right
that
he
had,
was
fixed
when
his
conviction
became
final,
as
opposed
to
the
case
where
you...
that
you're
postulating,
which
is
the
question
of,
yes,
the
state's
going
to
recognize
the
fourth
amendment
right
in
its
post-conviction...
does
the
right...
the
content
of
the
right,
itself,
is
not
changed
in
that
instance.
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
minnesota
legislature
could...
could
go
into
the
pre-finality
area.
in
other
words,
the
minnesota
legislature--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--your
honor,
i
think,
in
that
instance,
the
minnesota
legislature...
i
see
my
time
is
up,
but
i
think
in
that
instance
the
minnesota
legislature
is...
is
providing
the
minimum
that
the
constitution
requires.
so
the
answer
to--
mr.
patrick
c.
diamond
--that
is
yes.
