justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
our
holding
in
teague
was
that
it
did,
but
we're
not
going
to
let
you
out
of
jail?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
really
what
we
said
in
teague,
that
even
though
your
constitutional
rights
were
violated,
we're
going
to
foreclose
the
remedy
of
habeas
corpus?
i...
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
that...
you
know,
any
responsible
court
could
make
such
a
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
not
a
substantive
determination
of
federal
law
when
you
say
that
this
constitutional
change
that
we're
making
in
this
case
or
that
we
have
made
in
a
past
case
is
not
retroactive?
that
means
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
in
the
past
prior
to
the
announcement
of
this
case,
and
what
the
state...
what
you
want
the
state
court
to
be
able
to
say
is
yes,
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
violation
for
which
we're
going
to
give
a
remedy
in
habeas.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
exactly
what
crawford
means,
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what
happened.
that's
what
it
means,
whether
it's
a
new
rule.
what
does
a
new
rule
mean?
it
means
it
didn't
used
to
be
the
rule,
but
it
is
the
rule
after
this
case.
now,
you
can
argue,
and
there
are
many
originalists
who
would
agree
with
you,
that
there
shouldn't
be
such
a
thing
as
a
new
rule,
but
once
you've...
once
you've
agreed
that
there
can
be
new
rules,
if
this
court
says
this
is
a
new
rule,
we
acknowledge
it
wasn't
the
rule
before,
but
it's
new,
it
will
not
have
retroactive
effect,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
would
be
contradicting
that
ruling
by
saying
oh,
in
our
view
the
law
used
to
be
exactly
what
you
say
it
newly
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
position
is
we
have
asserted
all
that
power
in
the
world.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
butler,
let
me...
this
is
a
habeas
case,
but
i
assume
the
same
issue
could
come
up
in
a...
in
a
direct
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court.
is
it
your
position
that
in
a
direct
appeal,
the
state
can
determine
to
be
retroactive
constitutional
rights
that
we
have
said
are
not
retroactive,
on
direct
appeal,
now,
not
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
bases
its
decision
on
the
federal
constitution,
and
we
have
said
that
this
federal
constitutional
rule
is
not
retroactive,
what...
what
do
they
say
on
a
direct
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
my
next
question
is
going
to
be
whatever
they
say,
when
it
comes
up
to
us,
what
do
we
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
case
was
not
in
the
pipeline.
the
prosecution
began
after
our
new
decision.
okay?
and
it
comes
up
to
the
state
supreme
court.
can
the
state
supreme
court,
despite
the
fact
that
we've
said
the
decision
is
not
retroactive,
make
it
retroactive?
and
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
antonin
scalia
habeas
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
always
assumes
that
that's
a
remedial
question,
and
that
the
question
is
not
was
the
constitution
violated
at
the
time
this
act
occurred.
that...
if
that's
the
question,
then
you
acknowledge
that
the
state
can't
change
the
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
state
executive
can
do
that
with
respect
to
any
federal
law
that
it's
authorized
to
implement,
simply
choose
not
to,
couldn't
it?
that's
prosecutorial
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
do
you
think
the
state
is
free
to
decide
how
and
when
and
whether
it
will,
quote,
apply?
i
mean,
simply
to
separate
the
law
from
the
application
of
the
law
seems
to
me
no
answer
at
all.
is
there
any
other
area
where
you
say
well,
yes,
there
was
a
supreme
court
decision;
but
whether
to
apply
that
decision
is
up
to
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that's
correct.
you
have
to
say
that's
correct.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
think
you
can
also
explain
that
the
reason
it's
correct
is
the
court
probably
would
have
liked
to
say
yes,
we're
making
up
a
new
rule;
the
constitution
didn't
use
to
say
this;
and
this
rule
will
apply
from
now
on
to
all
actions
taken
by
individuals
from
now
on.
but
then,
you
know,
justice
harlan
says
my
goodness,
you're
going
to
give
relief
to
this
individual
and
not
give
relief
to
other
individuals
who
are
making
the
same
claim
and
already
have
cases
pending?
you
have
to
treat
them
equally.
so
we
will
make
an
equitable
exception
for
that.
but
basically,
the
existence
of
that
exception
does
not
prove
that
the
court
was
not
purporting
to
make
a
substantive
rule.
there's
an
exception
to
the
application
of
that
substantive
rule
for
pending
cases,
which
is
totally
understandable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
really
glad
to
hear
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
we
call
it
a
new
rule
in
teague?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
metaphysically
this
court
has
no
power
to
enunciate
new
constitutional
rules
metaphysically,
but
we
have
done
so,
and
teague
is
full
of
references
to
new
rules.
"we
therefore
hold
that
implicit
in
the
retroactivity
approach
we
adopt
today
is
the
principle
that
habeas
corpus
cannot
be
used
as
vehicle
to
create
new
constitutional
rules
of
criminal
procedure
unless
those
rules
would
be
applied
retroactively
to
all
defendants.
"
the
opinion
is
full
of
new
rules.
so...
so,
you
know,
we
have
violated
metaphysics
already.
having
violated
it,
in
adopting
new
constitutional
rules,
why
should
it
be
any
surprise
that
we
also
violated
it
in
the
application
of
those
rules?
there
should
be
no
surprise
at
all.
don't
get
hung
up
on
metaphysics,
mr.
turner.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
want
to
say
that,
mr.
turner,
because
that
would
place
you
in
the
position
of
saying
what
we
are
telling
people
in
these
teague
cases
is
oh,
yes,
the
constitution
was
violated,
but
we
don't
want
to
hear
about
it.
i
mean
that's
the
alternative,
to
acknowledge
that
the
constitution
is
violated
in
all
of
these
teague
cases,
some
of
them
being
capital
cases,
and
we
nonetheless
say
well,
too
bad,
it's
on
habeas.
i'd
like
to
think
that's
not
what
we're
doing,
that
what
we're
saying
is,
this
is
a
new
constitutional
rule,
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
before,
and
that's
why
we're
letting
it
stand.
