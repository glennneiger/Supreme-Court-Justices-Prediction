justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
i
have
is,
to
go
back,
you
said
two
separate
things.
one
is
you
say
the
question
here
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
i'll
give
you
that.
it's
a
matter
of
federal
law.
but
the
question
is,
what's
the
content
of
the
federal
law?
does
the
federal
law
say
to
the
states...
state,
in
a
collateral
review
proceeding,
you
want
to
apply
crawford
retroactively
to
people
whose
convictions
were
long
ago,
do
it,
we
don't
care?
and
a
lot
of
teague
says
that
should
be
the
federal
rule,
if
it's
called
a
federal
rule.
but
then
you
said
a
different
thing,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens.
the
different
thing
was
but
the
substantive
rule
of
crawford
only
takes
effect
as
of
the
day
of
crawford
and
into
the
future.
now,
on
that
position,
or
take
any
other
date
you
want
as
one
year
earlier
or
whatever
you're
going
to
pick
there,
if
you're
right
about
that,
you
win.
but
how
could
you
be
right
about
what
i
call
there
a
metaphysical
point?
because
on
the
metaphysics,
as
justice
souter
just
pointed
out,
imagine
three
people
who
have
three
identical
trials
each
one
year
before
crawford.
the
first
person
is
called
crawford,
and
he
wins.
the
second
person
is
called
smith,
and
he's
delayed
forever
in
the
appeals
process.
and
the
third
person
is
called
jones,
and
he
get
a
quick
appeal,
convicted,
in
jail
at
the
time
of
crawford.
now
we
know
that
the
first
two
crawford
applies
to,
but
metaphysically,
if
the
law
of
crawford
was
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
first
two
trials,
why
wasn't
it
the
law
in
terms
of
what
the
rights
are
in
respect
to
the
third
person
whose
trial
was
held
at
precisely
the
same
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
adopted
justice
scalia's
approach
through
your
silence,
and
i'd
ask
you
whether...
whether...
whether
there
isn't
just
a
simpler
explanation
that
doesn't
require
us
to
go
into
spinonza,
immanuel
kant,
or
even
aristotle.
and
the
simpler
explanation
would
be
simply
what
justice
stevens
started
with,
that
teague
is
about
remedies,
and
that
we
assume
that
the
law
was
the
law
at
the
time
of
crawford's
trial,
at
the
time
of
smith's
trial,
and
at
the
time
of
jones'
trial.
but
jones
is
knocked
out
because
he
went
to
habeas.
and
that's
what
teague
is
about.
habeas.
and,
therefore,
if
the
state
wants
to
apply
crawford
retroactively,
let
everybody
out
of
jail,
that's
their
problem.
or
their
virtue.
that's
up
to
them.
that's
where
justice
stevens
started,
and
that's
what
i
would
like
to
hear
an
answer
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
take
the
other
point
here,
which
is
justice
scalia's,
which
i
think
i
understand
now.
imagine
that
the
crawford
begins
to
take
effect
as
of
the
day
of
decision.
no
law
like
crawford
before.
but
for
practical
reasons
and
reasons
having
to
do
with
courts,
we
let
certain
people
take
advantage
of
it.
we
let
person
a
take
advantage
of
it,
mr.
crawford.
we
let
person
b
take
advantage
of
it,
who
is
on
direct
appeal.
we
don't
let
people
in
habeas
take
advantage
of
it.
why
don't
we
let
the
state
take
advantage
of
it
in
its
collateral
proceedings
if
the
state
wants
to,
for
reasons
of
federalism,
for
reasons
they
can
do
what
they
want,
for
reasons
if
it
is
going
to
be
the
law
in
the
future
any
way?
