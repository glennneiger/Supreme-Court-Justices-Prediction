that
issue
is
not
a
necessary
part
of
your
case
at
all,
but
you
don't
have
to
suggest
that
you
could
depart.
you
could
do
less
than
teague.
for
example,
griffith.
you
can
accept
that
as
a
given
because
it
doesn't
touch
your
case.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is...
there
is...
it's
not
as
though
we
have
a
new
rule,
and
we
apply
it
from
this
day
forward.
crawford
is
retroactive
at
least
for
cases
that
are
not
yet
final.
when
they
were
on
trial,
crawford
wasn't
there,
but
maybe
somewhere
toward
the
end
of
the
appellate
process,
lo
and
behold,
they
can
take
advantage
of
it.
so
it's
a
question
of
where
you
want
to
cut
it
off.
and
at
one
time,
didn't
this
court
cut
it
off
in
a
different
place?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm...
i'm
confused
on
this
one,
because
i
thought
it
was
part
of
our
retroactivity
jurisprudence
that
the
states
must
apply
that
new
rule
while
the
case
is
still
in
the
pipeline,
while
it
is
on
direct
appeal,
not
that
they...
well,
they
just
may,
but
they
absolutely
must
apply
it
retroactively.
i
thought
that's
what
griffith
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
comes
up
after...
if
the
prosecution
is
after
the
federal
decision,
of
course,
the
decision
has
to
apply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
can
say...
it
is
a
little
odd
that
the
state
executive
can
say,
yes,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
we
like
the
new
law,
or
what
was
always
the
law
but
the
court
wasn't
perceptive
enough
to
see
that,
we
like
it,
so
we're
not
going
to
raise
teague.
it
would
be
an
anomaly,
would
it
not,
that
the
executive
of
the
state
is
not
bound
by
teague,
but
the
courts
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
subject
to
the
floor,
that
the
floor
that
this
court
sets,
it
must
be
retroactive
to
a
certain
extent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
the
point.
i
thought
that
teague
was
driven
not
by
some
abstract
notion
about
finality,
but
the
intrusion
on
state
decision-making.
here
was
state
that
had
conducted
an
entire
process
that
appeared
to
be
in
line
with
what
the
federal
law
then
appeared
to
be.
and
then
the
state
is
told
by
some
federal
habeas
court,
state,
you've
got
to
do
it
all
over
again,
because
you
didn't...
you
didn't
predict
that
we
were
going
to
interpret
the
constitution
differently.
i
thought
that
the
really
motivating
idea
of
teague
was
it
addressed
the
federal
forum
and
said,
federal
forum,
don't
step
on
the
states'
toes,
don't
make
them
redo
trials
that
have
long
since
been
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
not
a
question
addressed
to
you,
mr.
diamond.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do
recognize,
though,
that
one
of
the
propelling
forces
behind
teague
and
why
we
changed
from
the
linkletter
regime
was
respect
for
state
courts'
processes
and
the
resistance
to
the
heavy
hand
of
federal
habeas
courts
telling
states
what
to
do.
it
seems
a
little
ironic
then
if
you
take
an
opinion
that
was
driven
by
the
feds
staying
out
of
the
state
courts'
territory
to
say
oh,
no,
we're
going
to
tell
you
that
it's
not...
we
control
when
we
want
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--state
executives
can
upset
all
those
expectations.
the
state
executive
says
i
want
this...
the
issue...
the
substantive
issue
in
this
case
settled,
so
i'm
not
going
to
raise
teague.
and
so
crawford
is
going
to
be
retroactive
because
i
say
so.
it
is
a
bit
of
an
anomaly
that
the
prosecutor
has
that
power
but
not
the
state
court
itself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
also
difficult
to
see
what
federal
interest
is
vindicated
when
the
state
says
we
know
we
have
to
respect
this...
call
it
what
you
want...
new
precedent
in
cases
still
in
the
pipeline,
and
we
don't
have
to
if
the
case
has
reached
a
final
judgment.
but
"not
required
to"
doesn't
say
"can't,
even
if
you
want
to.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
a...
could
a
state
say:
we
know
that
federal
habeas,
the
fourth
amendment,
is
out.
stone
v.
powell
says
when
it's...
when
you
go
through
the
direct
process,
that's
the
end
of
your
raising
a
search-and-seizure
claim.
could
a
state
say:
well,
we
know
the
fourth
amendment
is
binding
on
us
under
the
federal
constitution,
but
we
think
that
we
should
extend
the
fourth
amendment,
right,
not
only
to
cases
on
direct
review
but
to
collateral
review
as
well?
federal
habeas
courts
can't
do
it,
but
could
states?
