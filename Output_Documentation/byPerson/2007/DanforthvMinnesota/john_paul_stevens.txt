justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
basic
position
is
that
we
should
not
be
making
new
law.
we
should
be...
we
might
have
misinterpreted
the
law
over
the
years,
but,
basically,
this
court
has
no
power
to
change
the
text
of
the
constitution
or
its
meaning.
i
guess
justice
scalia's
position
is
we
have
all
that
power
in
the
world.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
overlooking
what
i
understand
to
be
the
basic
distinction
you're
drawing.
i
know
the
chief
justice
has
cast
doubt
on
it.
but
i
think
there
is
a
basic
distinction
between
rights
and
remedies.
and
you're
holding...
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
the
remedy
may
not
be
retroactive,
even
though
the
decision
itself
can
assume
that
there
would
have
been
a
violation
from
the
beginning
of
the
constitution
today
we
may
have
misinterpreted
before.
but
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
right,
then
there's
a
decision
about
what
kind
of
remedy
shall
be
imposed.
and
you
can
say
we
will
not
impose
a
remedy
for
past
wrongs,
even
though
we
must
impose
them
in
the
future
and
we
can
let
other
states
decide
whether
to
post
a
remedy
or
not.
and
that's
totally
consistent
with
the
holding
that
the
violation
is
always
retroactive,
but
the
remedy
may
not
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
the
same
as
the
question
of
whether
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
a
remedial
decision.
everybody
agreed
the
knock
and
announce
business
was
a
violation.
the
only
question
was
on
remedy.
and
there
are
lots
of
rights
that...
for
which
there's
no
remedy.
look
at
all
our
implied
cause
of
action
cases,
you
will
find
many,
many
examples
of
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
just
at
the
outset,
when
you
use
the
term
retroactivity,
are
you
saying
there
was
no
violation
of
the
constitution
before
the
decision,
or
there
just
is
no
remedy
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--one
of
the
cases
where
the
line
is
drawn
when
the
expiration
of
the
direct
review
has
passed.
is
it
your
view
that
at
that
particular
point
in
time
a
constitutional
violation
either
exists
or
it
does
not
exist?
it's
not
a
remedy
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
in
which
this
court
candidly
said,
we're
announcing
a
new
rule
which
was
not
the
law
before?
aren't
we
always
interpreting
what
we
thought
the
intent
of
the
framers
was
from
the
beginning,
even
though
we
may
have
gotten
it
before?
what
is
your
best
example
of
a
new
rule,
in
the
sense
it's
a
different
rule
of
law
as
opposed
to
a
different
remedy?
see,
all
these
equitable
considerations
go
to
the
remedy.
but
the
notion
we
can
make
up
a
new
rule
of
law
at
will
strikes
me
as
a
very
dramatic
departure
from
what
i
understand
the
rule
of
law
to
require.
justice
john
paul
stevens
finality
is
a
condition
for
fashioning
the
right
remedy.
there's
no
doubt.
everything
you
say
is
necessary
for
treating
litigants
in
a...
in
a
fair
manner.
but
that
all
goes
to
remedy,
not
to
the
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
crawford
itself,
it
seems
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
attention
given
to
history
long
before
the
original
interpretation
of
the
clause.
i
guess
that
was
unnecessary
because
we
were
making
up
new
rules.
is
that
the...--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
sort
of
basic
question?
the
teague
rule
is
a
federal
rule...
the
teague
ruling.
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
source
of
that
rule?
is
it
the
court's
power
to
announce,
make
federal
common
law?
or
is
it
a
constitutionally
mandated
rule?
i
will
give
you
one
other
decision,
cover
it
all
at
once.
and
if
it
were
not
a
judge-made
rule,
and
rather,
it
was
a
statute
and
it
goes
beyond
regulating
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings
and
effects
state
court
proceedings,
what
provision
in
the
constitution
would
have
given
congress
the
authority
to
enact
such
a
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
interpreting
it
the
way
you
interpret
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
qualifies
for
the
federal
system.
where
is
the
authority
to
regulate
the
state
system
come
from?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
where
would
congress
get
the
authority
to
require
state
courts
to
follow
the
rule,
the
interpretation
of
teague
that
you're
advancing
in
this
court,
that
they
may
not
go
beyond
the
decisions
of
this
court?
what
under
the
federal
constitution
authorizes
the
federal
government,
either
judges
or
congress,
to
tell
state
courts
that
they
cannot
do
what
your
opponent
argues
they
should
able
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree
when
you
are
talking
about
what
federal
court
can
do...
administering
a
federal
habeas
corpus.
i
have
no
problem.
i'm
asking
where
does
the
federal
authority
to
tell
state
courts
they
cannot
do
what
your
opponent
says
they
should
be
free
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
protection
of
this
court.
what...
why
can't
they
provide
more
protection?
what
federal
rule
prevents
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
it
is
a
knock
and
announce
violation.
they
don't
want
to
apply
an
exclusionary
rule.
can
they
apply
a
remedy
that
will
fire
any
officer
who
does
this?
or
will
they
say,
no,
you
can't
do
that,
because
it
goes
beyond
what
the
federal
constitution
requires?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
other
case
i
have,
danforth
against
minnesota,
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
state
supreme
court.
the
petitioner
is
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
his
1996
conviction
of
criminal
sexual
conduct
with
a
minor.
he
contends
that
allowing
the
jury
to
hear
a
videotape
interview
with
his
victim
violated
the
constitutional
rule
that
we
later
announced
in
crawford
against
washington.
generally
speaking,
new
rules
of
constitutional
procedure
must
be
applied
in
cases
that
are
not
yet
final
when
the
new
rule
is
announced.
then
under
our
decision
in
the
case
called
teague
against
lane,
a
new
rule
will
not
be
applied
by
a
federal
court
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
is
filed
after
the
state
conviction
has
become
final.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
minnesota
supreme
court
correctly
held
that
teague
limits
the
authority
of
state
courts
to
give
broader
effect
to
the
rule
we
announced
in
crawford
and
teague
requires.
we
have
never
suggested
that
it
does.
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
it
does
not,
neither
teague
nor
any
of
our
other
cases
explicitly
or
implicitly
constrains
the
authority
of
the
states
to
provide
remedies
for
a
broader
range
of
constitutional
violations,
then
federal
courts
must
remedy
by
issuing
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
the
chief
justice
joined
by
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
