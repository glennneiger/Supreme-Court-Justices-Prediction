justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
propose
if
the
state
of
minnesota
really
cared
about
this,
it
could
have
its
own
confrontation
rule.
does
it
have
a
confrontation
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
means
the
state
isn't
necessarily
tied
in
knots.
it
has
the
option
to
do
substantively
what
it
chooses.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
page

of
your
reply
brief,
the
yellow
brief,
you
take
issue
with
the
state,
and
you
say
the
state
is
wrong
if
there
is
a
decision
either
way
on
the
confrontation
clause
and
it's
questionable
under
federal
law,
we
can
review
it.
i
can
concede
that's
right,
but
that
doesn't
get
you
home.
that's
the
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
the
problem.
you're
now
creating
a
regime
in
which
state
courts
are
reaching
questions
that
we
said
ought
not
to
be
reached
for
final
convictions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
was
the
basis
on
which
we
decided
crawford.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
general
policy
rule,
but
it
may
well,
as
in
the
crawford
case,
as
a
good
example,
have
affected
this
court's
initial
determination
to
strike
off
in
a
new
direction.
we
did
so
knowing
that
there's
a
possibility
that
we
wouldn't
upset
final
convictions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
that
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even...
even
outside
of
the
habeas
context,
we...
we
decided
a
case,
hudson
v.
walker,
one
or
two
terms
ago.
it
was
a
no-knock
case.
we
said
that,
even
if
there
is
a
no-knock
violation,
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
apply.
this
would
be
too
costly
an
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule
and
would
bring
the...
would
make
the
fourth
amendment
a
disruptive
force.
under
your
view,
i
take
it,
the
state,
even
in...
in
its
trial
proceedings
subject
to
direct
review,
could
disagree
with
that
and
take
a
federal
concept,
no-knock,
and
then
apply
the
exclusionary
rule,
thereby
forcing
us
to
make
the...
to
draw
the
very
lines
that
we
said
we
ought
not
to
draw
in
hudson.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
you
agree
with
me,
then,
that
under
your
position,
the
state
could
apply
an
exclusionary
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
which
begins
with
the
sentence,
"this
court
has
no
interest
in
the
extent
to
which
its
constitutional
decisions
upset
final
judgments?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
part
of
that
because
of
what's
involved
in
expectations?
that's
the
smith
case,
where
we
said
the
determination
of
whether
a
constitutional
decision
is
retroactive
is
every
bit
as
much
a
question
of
federal
law
as
the
decision
of
the
substantive
right
itself.
we
said
that
in
smith.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
here
the
expectation...
in
smith
it
was
the
expectation
of
people
in
the
private
sector.
here
the
expectation
is
one
of
finality
of
judgments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--expectations
as
being
questions
of
remedy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
your...
your
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
earlier
should
be
that
there
is
uniformity.
some
states
are
fast,
some
are
slow,
but
in
the
end
there
is
a
final
judgment
which
is
a
settled
expectation,
and
the
substance
of
the
law
honors
settled
expectations,
which
is
finality.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
concern
is
not
so
much
a
concern
not
so
much
for
the
defendant
here
but
for
the
states,
isn't
it?
we
don't
want...
we
think
there
is...
there
is
an
important
value
implicit
in
habeas,
and
one
of
those
values
is
that
there
be
a
limit
to
the
degree
to
which
we
are
going
to
upset
the
settled
expectations
of
the
states.
isn't
that
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
must
say
i
have
serious
problems
with
your
position
in
that
regard.
if
you
were
not
to
prevail
in
this
case
and...
or,
pardon
me,
if
the
petitioner
were
to
prevail
in
this
case,
and
there
were
a
ruling
on
what
crawford
means,
or
doesn't
mean,
we
could
review
it.
i
think
the
petitioner
is
absolutely
right
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
concern
in
teague
was
not
only
with
state
court
processes,
but
with
settled
expectations
of
those
who
are
involved
in
the
criminal
system,
particularly
victims
who
are
entitled
at
some
point
to
rely
on
a
conviction
being
final?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
don't
usually
think
of
just
of
settled
expectations
as
being
questions
of
remedy.
we
consider
those
as
being
questions
of
substance.
