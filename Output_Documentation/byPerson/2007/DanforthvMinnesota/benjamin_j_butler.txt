mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
held
that
this
court
had
prevented
it
from
deciding
for
itself
which
state
prisoners
can
go
into
minnesota
state
courts
to
raise
federal
constitutional
challenges
to
their
conviction.
this
is
incorrect.
a
state
court
is
free
to
fashion...
the
state
courts
are
free
to
fashion
their
own
jurisprudence
as
to
who
may
raise
a
federal
constitutional
question
in
state
court
in
the
context
that
if
you
hear
state
courts
and
state
legislatures
can
make
their
own
policy
decisions
about
the
costs
and
benefits
of
allowing
state
prisoners
to
challenge
their
otherwise
final
convictions
based
on
new
rules
of
federal
constitutional
criminal--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--the
state
constitution,
justice
kennedy,
has
a
confrontation
clause.
its
jurisprudence
on
the
confrontation
clause,
its
own,
is
identical
to
this
court's
jurisprudence.
so,
yes,
theoretically,
a
petitioner
could
always
go
in
and
make
a
state
court
challenge
to
his
state
court
conviction.
the
question--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--the
question
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
think,
is
that
whether...
is
the
question
of
whether
it
has
to.
yes,
a
state
prisoner
can
make
a
state
court
challenge
to
his
conviction.
the
question
is,
does
he
have
to?
in
this
case,
mr.
danforth
challenges
his
conviction
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
well--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--your
honor--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--your
honor,
it's
simply
a
regime
under
which
the
state
court,
as
it
can
in
any
number
of
other
contexts,
can
choose
to
consider
the
merits
of
a
litigant's
claim.
the
federal
question...
the
federal
question
here
is...
well,
there
are
two.
in
this
case,
it's
whether
federal
law
prevents
the
state
court
from
hearing
it,
but
the
substantive
federal
question
is
whether
mr.
danforth's
conviction
violates
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
i
think--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--your
honor,
what
the
teague
court
did
was
set
up
a
procedural
and
a
prudential
limit
on
a
defense
available
for
the
state
in
the
particular
form
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
griffith
sets
forth,
as
we
see
it,
the
minimum
requirements
of
federal
law,
that
a
new
rule
must
be
applied
to
all
cases
that
were
pending
when
the
new
rule
is
announced.
that's
what
the
federal
constitution
requires.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
respectfully,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
i
think
the
disagreement,
if
there
is
one,
is
with
this
court's
policy
decision
in
teague
to...
that
the
court
announced
in
teague
as
to
whether
to
allow
such
challenges.
there's
no
disagreement
as
to
the
substance
of
crawford
or
to
the
substance
of
the
sixth
amendment.
nobody
has
ever
reached
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--what
we're
arguing
for,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
discretion
in
the
state
to
disagree
with
the
general
policy
rule
that
a
court
will
not
consider
a
new
rule
when
considering
the
validity
of
a
conviction
on,
in
teague's
case,
habeas
or
on
collateral
review.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
well--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--i
think,
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy,
if
i
could
address
your
points
in
turn,
on
justice
scalia's
question
about
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
constitutional
violation,
if
the
court
is
really
holding
that
there
was...
that
something...
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
at
the
time
petitioner's
conviction
became
final
or
at
the
time
mr.
bockting's
conviction
became
final
in
the
habeas
case,
then
what
the
court
is
really
holding
is
that
crawford
didn't
just
interpret
the
confrontation
clause;
it
somehow
changed
the
confrontation
clause,
that
the
confrontation
clause
meant...
that
the
confrontation
clause
said
one
thing
at
one
point
and
now
says
something
else.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
but
the
question,
your
honor--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
it
did.
in
fact,
for
centuries
everything
this
court
did
was
always
retroactive,
as
the
court
knows.
and
then
we
got
the
linkletter
balancing
test,
and
then
later
on
we
got
griffith
and
teague,
and
the
court
has
refined,
usually
through
the
scope
of
federal
habeas
corpus--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--it...
there...
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
case
law
on
that
point,
your
honor,
that
i'm
aware
of.
state
courts
usually,
as
they
do
today,
usually
followed
this
court's
retroactivity
decision.
but
it
is
unclear
whether
they
thought
they
had
to
or
whether
they
just
chose
to.
the
question--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--i
think,
when
it...
if
you
consider,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
teague
rule
is
a
procedural
rule
about
who
gets
to
make
what
claims,
then
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
the
state
court
could
say--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--well,
it
depends
on
the
impact
in
what...
in
what
setting,
your
honor.
it...
the...
the
teague
rule...
and
teague,
itself,
and
every
case
this
court
has
ever...
in
which
this
court
has
ever
considered
teague,
has
come
from
one
procedural
posture:
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
state
court
convictions.
it
is
over
that
posture
that
this
court
exercises
both
supervisory
power
and
control
to
interpret
the
various
federal
habeas
statutes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
what
hudson...
the
hudson
case
asked
was
whether
exclusion
of
evidence
was
required
under
the
fourth
amendment
when
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
a
no-knock
violation.
the
word
"required"
appears
throughout
the
opinion
in
hudson,
and
the
answer
was
no,
it
doesn't.
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
require
exclusion
of
evidence.
but
there
was
no
suggestion
in...
in
hudson
that
the
state
court
could
not
then
say,
here
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
we
need
to
come
up
with
what
the
remedy
is.
the
constitution
doesn't
require
us
to
suppress
the
evidence,
so
we
are...
we
either
choose
not
to--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--yes,
your
honor,
it
could
under
state
law.
and
if--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--well,
the...
that
is
not
based
on
that
distinction.
that
is
one
way
to
look
at
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in...
in
the
hudson
context,
it
is
definitely
a
question
of
right
and
remedy.
there's
no
question
in
hudson
that
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
the
question
is
what
remedy
is
required
by
the
constitution.
here,
mr.
danforth
wants
the
minnesota
state
court
to
consider
whether
his
constitutional
rights
were
violated.
it
did
not
hold
that
they
were
not.
it
held
that
it
could
not
consider
the
merits
of
his
claim
because
of
teague.
and
in
other
settings
this
court,
in
its
other
limitations
on
the
availability
of
habeas
corpus,
has
described
these
prudential
rules
like
teague
as
gateway
claims.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
as
long,
justice
scalia,
as
the
state
acknowledges
that
it
is
using
state
law
to
do
so,
that
it
is...
that
it
is
not
mismanaging
this
court's
retroactivity
jurisprudence.
in
other
words,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
think,
well,
we...
we
must
do
this.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
on
a...
on
a
direct--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--it
would...
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
that
is,
your
honor,
what
griffith
says,
and
that's...
that's
what...
that's--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--my
answer
is--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--my
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
if
the...
the--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
decision
would
apply.
if
the
prosecution
starts
after
this
court
announces
a
new
rule
and
then
says
that
it
is
not
retroactive...
when
you
announce
that
it
is
not
retroactive,
it
is
not
retroactive
to
cases
that
are
already
final.
if
the
case
hasn't
even
begun
yet,
then,
of
course...
then,
yes,
then
the
new
rule
would
apply.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
i
think
that's
a...
that's
a
somewhat
different
question,
your
honor,
and
it
would...
it
would
depend
on
if...
if
congress
passed
a
law
that
said
no
state
court
shall
apply
retroactively
something
or
other--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--in
the
past,
your...
i
think...
i
think
the
short
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
yes.
and
i
think
the
reason
it
can
is
because,
if
you
look
at,
for
example...
if
this
is
a
question
of
remedy,
then
i...
then
the
state
courts
have
all
the
power
to
grant
more
remedies,
to
grant
more
expansive--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--if,
your
honor...
think
about
the...
the
tax
cases,
for
example,
american
trucking
and
mckesson,
the
case...
the
companion
case.
in
both
of
those
cases,
especially
mckesson,
the
court
held
that
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
somebody's
constitutional
rights
and
the...
and
the
state
owes
that
person
some
sort
of
a
remedy,
then
the
state
can
give
whatever
remedy
the
minimum
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution
or
federal
law
are,
but
can
also
go
further.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
what...
what
we
are
relying
on...
we
are
relying,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
substance
of
the
sixth
amendment,
yes.
that
is
the
substantive
claim
mr.
danforth
makes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
that
is
absolutely
my
point,
justice
souter.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
it
is
not
even
just
state
common
law,
justice
souter.
it
is
state
statutory
law.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
only,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
federal
interest
is
so
strong
as
to
outweigh
all
of
the
state
court
interests.
and
when
it
comes
to
the
remedial
question
of
does
this
person
have
a
right
to
go
to
state
court
and
challenge
his
conviction,
that
is
quintessentially
the
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
that
if
this
court...
if
teague
is
a
rule
that
says
what
the
constitution
was
at
a
particular
time,
then
it
is
much
harder
for
us,
we
would
probably
have
to
make
a
state
law
claim.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
that's...
the
waiver
doctrine
about
teague
shows
why
teague
is
not
a
decision
about
what
the
law
was.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
no,
justice
scalia,
respectfully,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
if
the
law
at
the
time
of
mr.
danforth's
conviction
became
final
said
there's
no
confrontation
violation,
and
we
go
to
state
court
or
federal
habeas
court,
for
that
matter,
and
the
state
chooses
to
say
we
don't
want
to
apply
teague,
we'll
take
him
on
on
his
crawford
claim.
that,
under
a
view
that
the
law
has
changed,
that
allows
the
state
executive
branch
through
waiver
or
even
worse,
through
procedural
default,
inaction,
to
change
the
substance
of
federal
law.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
no,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
opinion
should
start
with.
i
don't
necessarily
think
that
that's
true.
i
don't
know
that
there's
no
interest
in
much
of
anything
in
this
case.
when
you
weigh
and
balance
the
interests,
however,
the
interests
of
the
state
courts
in
controlling
access
to
their
courthouse
doors,
in
reviewing
that
their
own
judgments...
i
mean,
teague
gets
back
to
a
comity
decision.
whatever
teague
is
is
based
almost
not
exclusively
but
primarily
on
comity
and
respect
for
state
courts.
federal
courts
are
not--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--no,
justice
alito,
it's
not.
the
state
court
has
used
in
the
past
the
linkletter
balancing
test.
it's
also
used
something
akin
to
teague.
and
then
in
this
case,
they
held
for
federal
rules
they
have
to
use
teague.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
the
retroactivity
analysis,
your
honor,
when
this
court
makes
a
decision
is
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested
earlier,
griffith.
the
court
says
when
it
makes
a
new
rule,
when
it
announces
what
it
believes
to
be
a
new
rule,
that
it
knows
that
it
will
apply
to
a
certain
group
of
cases.
it
doesn't
know...
it
can't
know
anything
more
than
that,
because
the
court
doesn't
exercise
control
over
other
courts--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--that
it
will
apply.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--that
are
already
finished.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
that
is
the
gravamen
of
our
argument,
justice
souter.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
when
you
talk
about
remedy--
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
--what
i
want
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
test
of
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation
clause,
this
court
decides
what
remedies
are
required,
what
remedies
for
certain
people
and
perhaps
for
other
people
what
remedies
are
not
required.
justice
harlan
in
mackey
called
it
the
body
responsible
for
defining
the
scope
of
the...
what
he
called
the
writ,
in
other
places,
the
adjudicatory
process.
in
this
case
it's
state
post-conviction
review.
it
is
that
body
that
decides
whether
there
shall
be
either
a
remedy,
you
want
to
call
it
a
remedy
for
the
violation,
you
want
to
call
it
who
decides
whether
the
decision
shall
be
applied
retroactively,
as
opposed
to
whether
it
is
retroactive.
it
is
the
group...
it
is
whoever
is
controlling
the
adjudicatory
process.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
subject
to
the
floor,
it
is
then
up
to
the
governing
body
to
decide
how
much
protection
to
give.
and
that
gets
back
to
justice
stevens's
point...
the
states
can
always
choose
to
give
either...
you
can
call
it
a
greater
remedy,
you
can
call
it
a
larger
retroactive
application,
as
long
as
the
substance
of
federal
law
doesn't
change,
then
it
is
a
state
question.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
it
is.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
in
habeas
corpus
as
well,
justice
stevens.
if
you
file
your
habeas
petition
one
day
late,
no
remedy.
if
you
don't
preserve
the
issue
in
the
trial
court,
no
remedy.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
we
are
not
asserting,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
state
court
has
the
ability
to
disagree
with
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
federal
constitution.
what
we
are
asserting
is
that
the
state
courts
and
the
state
legislatures
have
the
ability
to
decide
who
can
come
into
state
court
and
what
claims
the
state
court
can
listen
to.
and
i
want
to...
before
i...
my
time,
i
wanted
to
address...
justice
kennedy
had
a
concern
earlier
about
knowing
the
scope
of
the
application
of
a
right
when
you
announce
a
substantive
decision.
and
the
answer
to
that,
i
believe,
is
that
the
court...
not
only
does
it
already
know
it's
going
to
go...
it
will
apply
to
anything
pending
on
direct
review,
but
that...
that...
that
question
is
much
more
complicated
than
it
seems.
different
states
have
different
time
lines
for
when
something
is
pending
on
direct
review.
how
long
it
takes
an
appeal
to
pass
through
the
state
court
process?
what
requirements
of
the
defendant
are
there?
in
minnesota
it
takes
about
15
months
to
run
a
direct
appeal.
and
so
a
defendant
can
sit
there
for
15
months
and
know
that
he's
probably
going
to
get
the
benefit
of
any
decision
this
court
announces.
in
another
state
it
might
take
two
years.
in
another
state
it
might
take
six
months.
there's
different
groups
of
defendants...
even
under
the
griffith
standard,
we
already
don't
have
the
sort
of
uniformity
that
the
respondent
thinks
is
so...
thinks
is
so
important
in
this
area.
there's
always...
things
are
always
left
to
the
matter
of
state
courts
to...
to
decide...
to
have
their
own
procedural
rules
and
decide
how
best
to
use
their
adjudicatory
processes,
and
all
this
court
can
do
is
announce
the
best
federal
rules
it
thinks
the
constitution
supports,
have
some
idea
of
what
the
minimum
requirements
of
those
rules
are
going
to
be;
and
then
it
is
up
to
the
state
courts
to
decide
what
other
remedies
to
give
for
the
violations
that...
if
this
court
holds
something
is
a
violation,
then
it
is
up
to
the
state
courts
to
decide
as
a
minimum
who
it
will
apply
to.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
time.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
two
quick
points
in
my...
in
my
one
minute:
on
finality,
the
state
court
can
weigh
the
costs
and
benefits
of
upsetting
the
finality
of
its
own
conviction,
convictions
rendered
in
state
court
and
appeals
rendered
in
state
court.
it
can
decide,
as
several
states
have,
that
the
interests
in
full
adjudication
of
constitutional
claims
outweigh
the
interest
in
finality.
the
question
in
teague
was
whether
the
federal
court
could
decide
that
for
the
states,
and
the
answer
is
no.
but
the
states
can
decide
that
for
themselves.
on
justice
souter's
point
about
what...
or
somebody's
point
about
what
the
source
of
authority
was,
mr.
diamond
said
it
was
basic
norms
of
constitutional
adjudication,
and
that
is
the
phrase
used
in
griffith.
that
phrase
is
a
minimum.
the
basic
norms
of
constitutional
adjudication
require
the
following:
they
require
application
of
new
rules
to
pending
cases,
even
though
the
conduct
had
already...
had
already
happened.
they
don't
require
anything
more
than
that,
and
we're
not
here
asking
the
court
to
hold
that
they
do.
we're
simply
asking
the
court...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
benjamin
j.
butler
we
are
simply
asking
the
court
to
hold
that
if
the
state
wishes
to
go
beyond
the
minimum,
they
are
free
to
do
so.
thank
you.
