justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
you
are
also
relying,
as
i
understand
it,
on
state
common
law,
in
effect.
and
you
are
saying,
that
so
long
as
the
state
common
law
does
not
give
less
by
way
of
remedy
and
relief
than
the
federal
decision
requires,
the
state
is
free,
as
a
matter
of
state
remedial
common
law,
to
do
more.
that's
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
saying
that,
ultimately,
the
state's
choice
in
this
case
rests
upon
a
choice
of
state
common
law
about
procedure
leading
to
remedy.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
butler,
if
as
you
say
teague
is,
in
effect,
a
comity
rule,
then
what
is
your
answer,
in
effect,
to
justice
scalia's
point
that
we
make
a
decision
when
we
come
down
with
a
substantive
legal
judgment
about
the
constitution,
we
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
rule
is
retroactive
or
not?
and
he
says
that
if
you
look
at
teague
as
simply,
in
effect,
a
comity
decision,
that's
inconsistent
with
the
determination
that
we
have
made,
because
if
you
say
okay,
we
as
a
state
will
apply
it
earlier
than
the
feds
say
we
have
to,
you,
in
effect,
are
changing
the
substantive
determination
that
we
have
made,
that
the
decision
is
not
retroactive.
what
is
the
retroactivity
analysis
that
underlies
your
comity
analysis
of
teague?
justice
david
h.
souter
alright,
but
let's
be
more
specific.
what
does
it
know
about
retroactive
application
under
griffith?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
will
apply
to
some
cases
that
depend
upon
facts
and
have
eventuated
from
trials
that
are--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right.
so
that
there's
is
going
to
be
some
retroactivity?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
there
is
going
to
be
some
retroactivity,
then
i
take
it
your
position
has
got
to
be
and
is
our
substantive
decisions
are
not
so
much
retroactive
or
non-retroactive,
but
retroactively
applied,
to
some
extent,
and
not
retroactively
applied
to
others,
and
a
state
is
free
to
apply
it
more
retroactively
than
ours.
is
that
the
nutshell?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
is,
i
take
it,
not
that
the
decision
is
retroactive
or
not,
but
there
is
a
decision
about
the
degree
to
which
applications
will
be
retroactive
or
not?
that
is
what
underlies
your
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
how
do
you...
how
do
you
reconcile
that
answer
with
the
point
that
your
brother
made
just
before
he
sat
down,
and
that
is,
taking
standard
griffith
analysis,
the
application
of
a
so-called
new
rule
is
going
to
vary
depending
on
how
long
it
takes
a
person
on
direct
appeal
to
get
through
the
state
court
system?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
your
view
that
there
has
got
to
be
one
rule
with
respect
to
the
date
of
application
as
a
matter
of
substantive
federal
law,
because
we
know
for
a
fact
that,
depending
how
long
it
takes
to
get
through
the
state
appellate
system
on
direct
review,
the
new
rule
may
be
applied
and
it
may
not
be
applied.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
your...
your
point
about
finality,
and
finality
has
a
well-known
operative
effect.
but
one
operative
effect
when
the
federal
courts
have
defined
finality
and
have
said
it
is
not
final
until...
a
case
is
not
final
until
direct
review
is
over...
one
consequence
of
that
is
that
a
substantive
federal
rule
will
be
applied
to
an
individual
in
one
state
whose
crime
and
whose
trial
procedure
is
different
in
time
from
that
of
a
defendant
in
another
state.
so
that
the
consequence
is
that
the
substantive
rule
will
apply
to
some
people
who
acted
on
date
x
and
it
will
not
apply
to
some
people
who
acted
on
date
x;
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
inconsistent
with
your
answer
to
justice
stevens's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
it
is
inevitable,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
answer
justice
stevens's
question
the
way
you
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
finality
point
in
effect
establishes
a
way
of
calculating
the
application
of
a
rule
in
any
given
state
in
any
given
case,
but
it
will
not
result
in
the
uniform
application
of
the
rule.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
sort
of
like
defining
order
as
random
order,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
the
concern
is
a
concern
not
so
much.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
diamond,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
let
me
ask
you
a
question
which
is
totally
off
the
point
of
the
federal
constitution,
i
guess.
that
is,
if
minnesota
really
wants
the
rule
that
you
want
it
to
have,
its
legislature
can
provide
that
that
will
be
the
rule,
can't
it?
the
minnesota
legislature
can
pass
a
statute
saying
nobody
gets
more
than
teague
allows.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
the
minnesota
legislature
say:
look,
the...
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has...
has
come
down
with
some
rules.
we
won't
characterize
them
as
minimums
or
anything
else.
we'll
just
say
it's
a
set
of
rules.
it's
called
teague,
and
teague
is
going
to
be
the
law
for
the
application
of
federal
rights
in
minnesota
state
courts.
is...
can
the
minnesota
legislature
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
