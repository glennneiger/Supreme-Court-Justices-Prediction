chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
danforth
v.
minnesota.
mr.
butler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
federal
rules
don't
have
minimums
and
maximums.
they
have
a
rule.
and
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
you
can
have
a
state
rule
under
the
state
constitution
that
goes
further.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
states'
determination
to
apply
crawford
retroactively
must
be
based
on
a
disagreement
with
this
court's
teague
analysis,
which
refers
back
to
the
substantive
elements
of
crawford.
so,
in
other
words,
the
disagreement
at
bottom
is
a
disagreement
about
how
to
read
the
substantive
requirements
of
crawford.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
you...
i
understand
your
point.
teague
has
both
elements
to
it.
but
if
you're
applying
teague,
there
are
certain
exceptions
that
are
based
on
exactly
what
the
underlying
right
is,
what
the
crawford
right
is.
is
it
a
watershed
rule?
is
it
something
else?
and
the
court
makes
a
determination
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
on
those
points.
and
what
you're
arguing
for
is
discretion
in
the
state
to
disagree
with
those
substantive
determinations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
a
state...
can
they
pick...
can
a
state
pick
and
choose?
can
it
say
that
we
are
going
to
allow
crawford
claims
to
be
applied
retroactively,
but
other
claims,
we're
not
going
to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
if
you
think
that
the
teague
rule
is
an
assessment
of
the
substantive...
part
of
the
substantive
constitutional
interpretation,
an
assessment
about
what
the
impact
of
crawford
is
versus
other
decisions,
then
i
guess
they
couldn't,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
based
on
the
distinction
between
right
and
remedy,
a
distinction
that
is...
that
in
countless
areas
of
the
law
we...
we
have
said
is...
is
an
ephemeral
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
your...
does
your
approach
apply
to
legislative
enactment's
as
well?
let's
say
congress
passes
a
law
and
it
provides
as
particular
remedy,
and
it
says
this
remedy
shall
not
be
retroactive
but
only
apply
in
new
cases.
can
the
state
say
well,
we
think
it
ought
to
apply
to
old
cases,
pending
cases
on
habeas,
or
whatever,
and
so
we
are
going
to
apply
this
retroactively,
even
though
congress
said
it's
only
prospective?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
they
just
say
here's
a
new
remedy,
maybe
a
glance
and
exclusionary
remedy
in
cases
where
we
have
held
one
isn't
required...
can
the
state
allow
that
retroactively,
even
though
congress...
a
federal
remedy,
even
though
congress
has
said
this
federal
remedy
is
only
prospective?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
reliance
on
this
ancient
distinction
between
right
and
remedy...
i
mean
if
congress
says
you
don't
have
a
remedy
if
it's
retroactive,
it's
hard
to
say
what
kind
of
right
you
have.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
here
you
are
arguing
in
favor
of
retro-application
of
federal
law.
there
is
no
issue...
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
you
can
have
a
state
confrontation
clause
and
do
whatever
you
want
with
it.
but
you
are
relying
on
the
federal
provision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
would
have
thought
the
very
least
teague
is,
is
federal
common
lawful.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
federal
law
of
remedies.
i
think
it
is
more
than
that.
i
think
it
is
substantive
constitutional...
substantive
federal
constitutional
law.
but
it's
at
least
federal
common
law,
and
doesn't
federal
common
law
preempt
state
common
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
is
the
other
way
around
which
makes
it
problematic.
you
are
going
to
say
the
remedy
is
retroactive
even
if
there's
no
right.
you're
going
to
say
where
we
have
decided
that
there
is
no
remedy
and,
therefore,
if
you
have
a
right,
it's...
i
don't
know
what
you
get
out
of
it...
you
want
to
say,
no,
there
is
a
remedy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
have
to
argue,
and
this
is
why
i
think
the
distinction
has
been
rejected
in
so
many
other
areas
of
the
law,
you
have
to
argue
that
the
remedy
question
is
totally
separate
from
an
analysis
of
the
right.
because
otherwise,
you
are
saying
the
state
courts
have
the
right
to
disagree
with
our
determination
of
what
the
federal
right
is.
if
you
think
the
remedy,
the
question
of
remedy
draws
some
substance
from
what
the
right
is,
which
i
would
have
thought
is
obviously
the
case,
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
asserting
a
power
on
the
basis
of
the
state
court
to
overturn
our
federal
law
determinations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you...
thank
you,
mr.
butler.
mr.
diamond.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you're
handling
these
questions
very
well.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
diamond.
mr.
butler,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
butler.
the
case
is
submitted.
