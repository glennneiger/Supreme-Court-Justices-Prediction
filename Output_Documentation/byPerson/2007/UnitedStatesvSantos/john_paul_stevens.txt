maybe
the
question
presented
doesn't
present
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
i
think
the
facts
of
the
case
do
present
it.
i
mean,
it's
theoretically
possible
we
could
agree
with
you
on
the
profits
issue,
but
nevertheless
say
this
doesn't
fit
the
promotion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
all
that,
but
we
can
still
do
it
if
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
that's
the
right
way
to
dispose
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
roberts...
that
the
gambling
offense
is
conducting
a
gambling
business,
so
it
makes
it...
it
is
not
just
the
gambling
itself--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
are
saying
it
would
not
be
covered
as
money
laundering,
but
nevertheless
it
would
be
illegal
and
be
punished
as
gambling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
everything
they've
done
here
would
be
punished
as
gambling--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
you
imagine
running
a
illegal
gambling
business
and
advertising
your
expenses?
i
mean,
you
have
got
to
conceal
these--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it's
not
additional
conduct.
that's
the
point.
