justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
roberts,
isn't
it
true
that
the
problems
that
are
being
highlighted
are
problems
that
result
from
expansive
interpretations
of
other
concepts
that
are
not
before
us
here,
expansive
interpretation
of
promotion,
expansive
interpretation
of
concealment?
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
first
appeal
in
this
case
interpreted
promotion
very
broadly.
and
then,
i
guess
it
felt
that
it
had
boxed
itself
in
and
that's
what
led
to
this
interpretation
of
proceeds.
but
if
you
interpret
those
other
concepts
more
narrowly,
you
don't
have
the
same
kind
of
overlap.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
roberts,
isn't
it
true
that
the
seventh
circuit's
interpretation
of
proceeds
doesn't
really
solve
these
problems
except
in
the
case
of
an
unprofitable
business?
in
the
case
of
a
profitable
illegal
enterprise,
all
of
the
same
problems
exist.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
this
doesn't...
"proceeds"
must
mean
the
same
thing
in
every
money
laundering
case,
doesn't
it?
and
every
money
laundering
case
is
not
based
on
a
gambling
business.
there
are
drug
businesses
and
all
sorts
of
other
predicates.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
it
mean
something
different
in...
depending
on
the
underlying
illegal
activity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
of
the
definition
of
"proceeds".
isn't
it
very
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
wanted...
wanted
to
adopt
the
net
income
definition
in
light
of
the
legal
issues
and
the
problems
of
proof
that
that
would
involve?
let's
take
the
example
of
an
international
drug
ring
that
has
assets
in
a
foreign
country.
they
may
have
crops.
they
may
have
processing
plants,
warehouses,
trucks,
airplanes,
et
cetera.
they
ship
millions
of
dollars
of
drugs
into
the
united
states.
they
get
millions
of
dollars
in
gross
revenue
here
every
year.
they
hire
a
professional
money
launderer
to
launder
the
money
here.
now,
the
government
wants
to
prosecute
the
money...
the
person
they
hired
plus
members
of
the
organization.
the
person
they
hired
may
not
know
and
may
not
care
whether
the
money
that
was
being
laundered
was
profits
or
not.
and
how
are
you
going
to
prove
what...
whether
this
enterprise
was
a
profitable
enterprise
or
not?
they
may
have...
and
they
may
have
enormous
gross
revenue,
but
they
may
have...
they
may
have
enormous
expenses
overseas.
they
may
have
bought
a
lot
of
warehouses
and
equipment.
they
may
have
lost
a
lot
of
things
because
they
were
raided
by
the
government,
destroyed
the
factory,
killed
the
plants.
it
becomes
as
impossible
situation,
and
why
would
congress
ever
have
adopted
a
definition
like
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
sure
that's
true.
they
wouldn't
be
that
worried
about
the
unprofitable
criminal
enterprises
because
they
wouldn't
last
very
long.
but
there's
the...
there
still
is
the
problem
of
proof--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--proving
that
it's
profitable.
