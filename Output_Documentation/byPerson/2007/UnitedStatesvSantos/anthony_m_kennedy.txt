justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
what
happens
if
there's
a...
two
bank
robbers,
the
one's
with
the
get-away
car;
the
other
one
going
into
the
bank
teller,
and
the
robber
that
goes
into
the
bank
gets
$1,000
and
comes
out
and
gives
500
to
the
get-away
guy.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
if
your
definition
of
proceeds
is
problematic,
it
is
something
like
an
abstract
question
you're
asking
us
to
answer.
if
this...
if
we
say
well,
we're
not
sure
this
is
proceeds
but
if
it
is
proceeds,
it
is
defined
as
gross
receipts.
that's
an
artificial
context
in
which
to
address
the
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
see
the
problem
we
have
is
we're
not
sure
that
it
is
within
the
statute.
so
then
you're
asking
us
to
say
how
to
make
the
statute
work
when
we
don't
think
the
statute's
applicable
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
argue
at
any
point
that
these
were
not
proceeds?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
it
is
a
stretch
so
far
as
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented
is
very
clear
whether
or
not
it
is
gross
receipts
or
net
profits.
that's
what
we're
asked
to
resolve.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
brief
in
opposition--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
about
the
bank
robber...
there's
just
one
bank
robbery.
they
spend
$500
to
each,
to
people
for
their
airfare
and
car
rental.
they
rob
the
bank.
they
only
get
$800.
they
lost
$200.
they
then
give
the
$800
to
the
attorney
to
please...
or
to
somebody
to
please
launder
the
money.
no
profits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
would
be
a
very
silly
result.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
they
gave
it
to
a
third
person
to
conceal
it,
$800.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
8,000,
8
million.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
that
it's
proceeds.
assume
that
they
have
a
money
launderer.
under
your
definition
there's
still
no
violation?
