justice
antonin
scalia
where...
so
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
some
rule
up
there
that
says
every
criminal
statute
has
to
cover
as
much
as
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it...
i
think
it
much
more
remarkable
than
that,
more
extraordinary
than
that,
that
congress
would
want
to
make
all...
all
betting
operations
like
this
a
violation
automatically
of
two
criminal
statutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that
sort
of,
you
know,
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh
well,
i
mean...
come
on.
nobody...
nobody
runs
a
gambling
operation
without
paying
off
the
winners.
it's
not
going
to
last
very
long.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
make
the
paying
off
of
the
winners
a
separate
crime
from
running
the
gambling
operation
seems
to
me
quite
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
will
solve
a
lot
them.
and
unless
you're
willing
to
come
in
and
say,
yes,
do
it
to
us,
give
us
a
narrower
definition
of
concealment
and
a
narrower
definition
of
what's
a
transaction,
but
you're
not
willing
to
do
that.
you're
going
to
stretch
that
as
broadly
as
you
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
might
well
reject
it
if
you're
going
to
have
a
narrow
definition
of
proceeds.
i
mean,
that
rejection
was
connected
with
its
acceptance
of
a
narrow
definition
of
proceeds.
and
if
you're
asking
us
to
obliterate
the
latter,
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't
reasonable
to
send
it
back
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
say,
well,
you
still
said
the
same
thing
if
you
came
out
differently
on
the
proceeds
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that
extraordinary.
you
really
come
in
and
say
yeah,
two
crimes,
assume
congress
meant
ordinary
gambling
crime
to
carry
with
it
this
other
extraordinarily
high
penalty
for
the
same
activity
that
involves
the
gambling,
but
don't
worry
about
it,
we'll
even
it
out
in
the
sentencing.
i
mean...
that's
no
way
to
run
a
railroad.
justice
antonin
scalia
straighten
that
out
in
the
definition
of
the
crime,
rather
than
in
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
continues?
the
business
has
to
continue.
you
are
not
engaging
in
a
gambling
business
if
you're
not
paying
off
the
winners.
that's
all.
that's
not
a
good
decent
honest
gambling
business.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
because
gambling
under
the
definition
has
the
three
elements
that
do
not
include
paying
off
the
winners.
that's
what
it
all
represents--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
course
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
are
you
urging
us
to
create
two
problems,
to
drag
along
all
of
the
problems
that
you
object
to
with...
with
interpreting
proceeds
to
include
simply
covering
your
expenses?
you
acknowledge
that
the
problems
you
point
out
would
continue
to
exist
if
we
accept
your
definition.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
accepting
your
definition
creates
other
problems
of
its
own,
such
as
the
difficulty
in
every
case
of
showing
that
an
illegal
operation
made
a
profit,
such
as
the
difficulty
of
deciding
what
kind
of
criteria
you
use
for
determining
what
are
the...
what
are
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
of
a
criminal
enterprise.
why
should
we...
why
should
we
choose
to
get
the
worst
of
both
worlds?
and
why
isn't
the
proper
way
to
attack
the
difficulty
to
focus
in
on
what
constitutes
a
transaction
and
what
constitutes
concealment...
something
other
than
the
"proceeds"
definition?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
vare,
you
know,
i'm...
i'm
unwilling
to
decide
the
definition
of
transaction
question
in
the
present
case
because,
frankly,
i
think
that's
a...
in
itself,
a
very
difficult
question
which
we
haven't
had
adequately
argued.
for
example,
while
i
believe,
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
that
paying
off
the
winners
is...
is
an
essential
part
of
a
gambling
operation,
i
don't
believe
that
paying
off
runners
necessarily
is.
you
can
have
a
gambling
operation
without
runners,
can't
you?
you
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can...
you
can
view
that
as
something
beyond
the
mere...
the
mere
gambling
crime.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
you
can
view
that
paying
off
the
winners
is
beyond
the
gambling
crime,
but
i
do
think
having
a
bunch
of
runners
and
paying
off
each
of
them
is
not
necessarily
part
of
gambling.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
proving
that
it's
profitable;
proving
that
the
person
laundering
it
knew
that
it
was
profits
because
that's
part
of
the
definition
of
the
crime,
that
scienter.
and
how
can
you
prove
that
the
fellow
knew
that
it
was
profits?
he
would
very
rarely
know
whether
it
was
or
wasn't.
so
he
skips
off
scot-free
free
of
the
laundering
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
what...
what's
the
total
stage
you
look
at?
suppose
it's
profitable
1
month
and
not
the
next
month,
and
the
loss
the
second
month
more
than
undoes
the
profits
of
the
first
month.
can
you
still
prosecute
them
for
the
profits
in
the
first
month?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
day
they
could
pick
then,
they
have
one
good
day.
and
they
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
does
it
have
to
be
the
ordinary
expense
of
that?
i
mean,
let's
assume
the
charge
is
murder,
and
i
happen
to
use
a
hit
man
for
the
murder.
that's
proven
and
whatnot.
why...
you
mean,
that
isn't
part
of
the
murder
conviction,
simply
because
i
could
have
done
it
without
a
hit
man,
i
could
have
done
it
myself?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
paying
the
hit
man
would
be
part
of
the
murder
transaction?
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wanted
to
kill
his
wife,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
another
money
laundering
case.
it
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
from
the
1970's
until
1994,
respondent
efrain
santos
operated
an
illegal
lottery
in
indiana.
at
bars
and
restaurants,
santos'
runners
gathered
bets
from
gamblers,
keeping
a
portion
as
their
commissions
and
delivering
the
rest
to
santos'
collectors.
collectors,
one
of
whom
was
respondent
benedicto
diaz,
then
delivered
the
money
to
santos,
who
used
some
of
it
to
pay
the
salaries
of
the
collectors
and
some
of
it
to
pay
the
winners.
these
payments
formed
the
basis
of
federal
charges
brought
against
respondents
--
against
both
respondents.
diaz
pleaded
guilty
to
one
money
–
money
laundering
count
and
the
jury
found
santos
guilty
of
two
illegal
gambling
counts
and
three
money
laundering
counts.
in
post
conviction
proceedings,
respondents
challenged
their
money
laundering
convictions.
the
money
laundering
statute
prohibits
knowingly
engaging
in
transactions
that
involve
proceeds,
proceeds
is
the
critical
word,
of
specified
criminal
activities,
including
the
running
of
an
illegal
gambling
business.
the
defendants
maintained
that
proceeds
means
profits
and
that
santos'
payments
to
runners,
collectors
and
winners
and
diaz's
receipt
of
payments
for
collection
services
were
transactions
involving
receipts
rather
than
profits.
the
district
court
agreed
and
vacated
the
money
laundering
convictions.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
and
so
do
we.
in
the
plurality
opinion,
joined
in
full
by
justice
souter
and
justice
ginsburg
and
in
part
by
justice
thomas,
“we
hold
that
the
word
proceeds
in
the
federal
money
laundering
statute
means
profits
and
not
receipts."
when
as
here,
a
statute
does
not
define
a
term,
we
give
it
its
ordinary
meaning.
narrowly,
however,
the
noun
“proceeds”
can
mean
either
receipts
or
profits,
think
of
a
fundraiser
that
promises
to
give
its
proceeds
to
charity.
the
government
argues
that
the
primary
meaning
of
proceeds
is
receipts,
but
we
think
that
some
dictionaries'
preference
for
that
definition
is
too
slight
for
us
to
agree.“
proceeds”
moreover,
has
no
uniform
meaning
in
the
united
states
code
and
it
is
not
a
money
laundering
term
of
art,
meaning
receipts.
under
either
of
the
words
statutes
--
ordinary
definitions
under
either
of
them,
all
provisions
of
the
federal
money
laundering
statutes
are
coherent,
no
provisions
are
redundant
and
the
statute
is
not
rendered
utterly
absurd.
according
to
a
long
line
of
our
decisions,
the
tie
must
go
to
the
defendant.
the
rule
of
lenity
requires
ambiguous
criminal
laws
to
be
interpreted
in
favor
of
the
defendants
subjected
to
them.
it's
not
only
vindicates
the
fundamental
principle
that
no
citizen
should
be
held
accountable
for
violation
of
a
statute
whose
commands
are
uncertain
or
subjected
to
punishment
that
is
not
clearly
prescribed,
it
also
places
the
weight
of
inertia
upon
the
party
that
can
best
induce
congress
to
speak
more
clearly
and
keep
courts
from
making
criminal
law
in
congress'
stead.
because
the
profit's
definition
of
proceeds
is
always
more
defendant-friendly
than
the
receipt's
definition,
the
rule
of
lenity
dictates
that
it
should
be
adopted.
the
government
contends
that
we
should
reject
the
profit's
interpretation
because
it
fails
to
give
the
federal
money
laundering
statute
its
proper
scope.
that
of
course
begs
the
question.
our
interpretation
does
not
give
the
statute
its
proper
scope
if
proceeds
means
receipts
and
it
does,
given
its
proper
scope,
if
proceeds
means
profits.
if
we
accepted
the
government's
invitation
to
speculate
about
congressional
purpose,
we
would
have
to
confront
and
explain
the
strange
consequence
of
the
receipt's
interpretation
which
respondents
have
labeled
a
merger
problem.
a
merger
problem
consists
of
the
fact
that
many
crimes
already
punished
by
other
laws
are
routinely
accompanied
by
financial
transactions
which,
if
the
receipt's
interpretation
is
adopted,
violate
the
money
laundering
statute
and
thus,
expose
defendants
to
much
more
severe
penalties.
to
take
the
present
cases
and
example,
under
the
receipt's
interpretation,
paying
off
the
winning
betters
from
the
receipts
of
an
illegal
gambling
operation,
constitutes
money
laundering,
thus
adding
to
the
penalty
of
a
maximum
of
five
years
for
running
an
illegal
gambling
operation,
an
additional
penalty
of
a
maximum
of
20
years
for
money
laundering.
this
obviously
makes
no
sense
since
gambling
operations
routinely
payoff
the
winners.
if
congress
wanted
a
25-year
penalty
for
gambling,
it
would
have
prescribed
a
25-year
penalty
for
gambling.
if
proceeds
means
receipts,
the
federal
money
laundering
statute
effectively
amplifies
the
punishment
for
a
host
of
predicate
crimes.
the
government
also
advocates
the
receipt's
interpretation
because
it
is
easier
to
prosecute.
essentially,
the
government
asks
us
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
in
light
of
congress'
presumptive
intent
to
facilitate
money
laundering
convictions.
that
turns
the
rule
of
lenity
upside
down.
we
interpret
ambiguous
criminal
statutes
in
favor
of
defendants,
not
prosecutors.
in
any
event,
we
believe
for
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion
that
the
government
exaggerates
the
prosecutorial
difficulties
that
the
profit’s
interpretation
entails.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
breyer
have
joined.
