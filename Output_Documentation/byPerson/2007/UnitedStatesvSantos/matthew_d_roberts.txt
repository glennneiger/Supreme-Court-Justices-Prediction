mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
seventh
circuit
has
seriously
misconstrued
the
federal
money
laundering
statute
by
interpreting
the
term
"proceeds"
to
mean
profits.
the
statute
prohibits
the
laundering
of
all
the
gross
receipts
of
a
crime,
not
just
its
profits.
the
primary
meaning
of
"proceeds"
is
gross
receipts,
and
the
statutory
context
makes
clear
that's
the
meaning
congress
intended
here.
the
statute
is
structured
to
prevent
criminals
from
using
the
fruits
of
their
crimes
to
promote
or
to
conceal
their
illegal
activities.
but
a
profits
definition
of
proceeds
would
constrict
the
statute
in
ways
that
can't
be
squared
with
that
statutory
objective.
because
the
word
"proceeds"
appears
in
the
introductory
section
of
the
statute,
those
kinds
of
restrictions
would
apply
to
both
concealment
and
promotion
cases.
for
example,
the
statute
wouldn't
cover
expense
payments
that
are
structured
to
conceal
the
unlawful
nature
and
source
of
the
funds
involved.
that
means
that
if
an
illegal
gambling
operator
recorded
the
compensation
that
he
paid
his
collectors
as
salary
payments
by
a
legitimate
business
that
he
owned,
that
that
would
not
be
covered
under
the
statute.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
congress
was
trying--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
that's
not
what
we're
arguing.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
there
is
no
reason
that
congress
wouldn't
have
covered
these
transactions
and
that
they
implicate
the
objectives
of
the
statute
as
revealed
by
its
text,
just
as
much
as
the
transactions
that
are
clearly
covered.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
your
honor--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
is
certainly
true
that
illegal
gambling
and
money
laundering
are
going
to
occur
together,
but
that
isn't
a
cause
for
concern.
it
just
reflects
the
fact
that
certain
businesses,
illegal
businesses
like
gambling
operations,
like
drug
dealing,
frequently
generate
large
amounts
of
cash
and
they
need
to
launder
that
cash
in
order
to
survive
and
to
prosper.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
it's
not
the
same
conduct
in
that
the
conduct
here,
the
paying
the
winners
and
paying
the
collectors
is
not
a
required
element
of
the
gambling
offense.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and,
true--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it...
it...
it's
true,
your
honor,
that
they're
not
going
to
last
very
long.
they're
not
going
to
survive.
they're
not
going
to
grow.
that's
because
they
need
to
commit
money
laundering
in
different
ways
to
do
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
is,
if
the...
if
the
payment
would
promote
the
continuing...
if
they've
got
a
continuing
robbery
operation
and
by
paying
him
he's
going
to
say,
he's
saying,
you
know,
keep
on
continuing
in
the
operation
and
let's
expand
it
further.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
your
honor,
your
question
and
a
lot
of
the
questions
i'm
getting,
i
think
express
concern
about
treating
these
transactions
as
promotion
under
the
statute.
but
the
question--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--what
i
don't--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
because
what
needs
to
be
concealed,
what
there
needs
to
be
is
a
financial
transaction
that's
designed,
the
transaction
itself,
to
conceal
the
nature
and
source
of
the
proceeds.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
that
doing
a
robbery
in
the
alley
would
be
a
financial
transaction...
would
be
designing
a
financial
transaction
to
conceal
the
unlawful
nature
and
source
of
the
proceeds.
but
if
i
can
give
you
an
example
of--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
try
to
say
to
justice
souter's
question
before
that
if
you
have
concerns
that
these
kind
of
expense
payments
should
not
be
treated
as
promotional
money
laundering,
the
way
to
address
those
is
not
by
adopting
a
profit
construction
of
proceeds,
because
that
would
do
tremendous
violence
to
the
statute
in
other
ways.
and
i
do
think
that
there
are--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
think
it's
difficult
to
interpret
the
proceeds,
the
term
"proceeds",
to
mean
something
different
for
business
operations
than
for
other
crimes
because
it's
the
same
word.
but
even
so,
your
honor,
there
are
other
ways--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--okay.
i'm
sorry.
even
so,
there
are
other
ways
in
which
a
profits
definition
just
makes
no
sense
under
this
statute,
besides
the
numerous
concealment
transactions
that
would
be
excluded
that
congress
would
have
no
reason
not
to
cover.
it
also
would
make
no
sense
as
applied
to
professional
money
launderers.
those
are
people
who
are
hiding
money
for
criminals
as
a
matter
of
their
business.
because
they
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
money
laundering,
even
if
they
knew
that
they
were
concealing
money
that
was
generated
by
a
federal
felony,
unless
they
also
knew
that
the
money
was
profits.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
right.
that's
another
point,
your
honor,
that
a
profits
definition
itself
isn't
going
to
solve
the
problem
of
where
the
underlying
crime
and
the
money
laundering--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it's
not
going
to...
it's
not...
first
of
all,
this
case
doesn't
present
the
interpretation
of
promotion
and
the
court
would
be
free
to
address
that
in--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
certainly
could,
your
honor.
but
that
would
not
be
an
alternative
ground
that
would
be
appropriate
for
you
to
rule
on
in
this
case,
because
that
issue
was
raised
on
direct
appeal.
it
was
decided
against
respondents
by
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--you
can
obviously
address
any
issue
that
you
want
to,
your
honor.
but
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
issues
that
have
been
decided
on
direct
review
shouldn't
be
relitigated
on
collateral
attack.
the
issue
wasn't
addressed
by
either
of
the
courts
below
in
these
collateral
proceedings.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
do
submit
that
it
was
resolved
correctly
in
this
case,
because,
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
and
as
all
the
other
courts
of
appeals
have
held
about
promotion,
the
payments
to
the
winners
and
the
payments
to
the
collectors
encourage
the
continued
participation
of
the
collectors
and
encourage
the
increased
participation
by
gamblers.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
could
do
that,
but
the
question
that
i
think
that
is
concerning
the
court
was
resolved
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
very
case
on
direct
appeal.
so
on
direct
appeal,
the
argument
was
made
by
mr.
santos
that
these
transactions
can't
count
as
promotional
money
laundering
because
they're
essential
transactions
of
the
business
and
that
they
don't
promote
the
carrying
on
of
the
business,
and
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
those
arguments.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
we
certainly
would
prefer
that
you
did
that
than
that
you
interpreted
proceeds
to
mean
profits
because
of
the
violence
that
it
would
do
to
the
remainder
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
i
was
talking
about
professional
money
launderers
before
and
how
they
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
money
laundering
if
they
were
concealing
money
that
they
knew
that
was
generated
by
a
crime.
and
congress...
there's
no
reason
that
congress
would
have
considered
those
professional
money
launderers
to
be
less
culpable
merely
because
they
might
be
laundering
only
illicit
receipts.
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
government
to
prove
that
professional
money
launderers
knew
that
they
were
laundering
profits
because
they
haven't
participated
in
the
predicate
crime.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
think
you
decide
the
question
presented
here
and
you
decide
that
proceeds
means
that...
that
proceeds
means
gross
receipts,
because
that's
the
only
meaning
that
makes
sense
with
the
statute.
but
the
sentencing
point
you
make
is
a
very,
very
good
one,
your
honor.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
were
changed
in
2001
to
align
the
punishment
for
money
laundering
when
people
participate
in
the
underlying
crime
much
more
with
the
punishment
level
for
the
underlying
crime.
and...
you
know,
in
addition,
as
we
know,
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
advisory,
and
so
courts
could
certainly
take
into
account
concern
about
overlap--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
think
that
you
can't
have
all
of
them
together,
your
honor,
unfortunately.
but
i
do
think
that
we
would
say
that
out
of
the
three
that
you
raised,
the
best
way
to
deal
with
concerns
about
this
would
be
in
the
sentencing
context.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
not...
your
honor,
it's
just
not
exactly
the
same
activity,
because
people
can
commit
gambling
without
commit
money
laundering.
they
can
be
guilty
of
illegal
gambling
without
being
guilty
of
money
laundering--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--but
they
can
be...
even
under
this
definition,
your
honor.
in
this
very
case
there
were
restaurant
and
tavern
owners
that
permitted
the
gambling
bets
to
be
taken
on
their
premises
because
it
increased
their...
the
patronage
of
their
businesses.
and
they
were
convicted
of
participating
in
illegal
gambling
operations.
they
didn't
commit
money
laundering,
because
they
didn't
engage
in
a
financial
transaction
that's
not
an
element
of
the
gambling
offense,
that
involves
the
proceeds
of
the
offense,
and
that's
intended
either
to
conceal
the
proceeds--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
is...
but
the
statute
defines
what
the
three...
the
statue
defines
what
the
three
elements
of
the
gambling
business
are,
your
honor.
that
it's
illegal
gambling
that's
illegal
under
state
law,
that
involves
5
or
more
persons,
that
it
has...
continues
for
more
than
30
days
or
has
more
than
$2,000
in
gross
revenues
in
a
day.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
gambling
business...
it
might
be
gambling
and
fraud,
your
honor.
but
the
gambling
business
can
continue
for
more
than
30
days
without
having
paid
the
winners
if
they
had
a
lottery
every
month,
and
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
month...
they
hadn't
paid
the
winners
yet,
it
would
have
gone
for
the
30
days,
in
a
31-day
month
without...
without
having
paid
the
winners.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
i
think
that
what
they're
asking
you
to
do
is
to
interpret...
and
what
the
seventh
circuit
has
done,
is
to
interpret
proceeds
in
a
way
that
makes
no
sense
for
the
statute
in
order
to
deal
with
these
concerns
about
promotion
cases
that
can
be
dealt
with
in
the
other
ways
that
justice
breyer
raised.
and
there
are
really
four--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
probably
should
know
the
answer
to
what
the
precise
range
would
be
under
the
guidelines.
now,
i
don't.
but
what
i
do
know
is
before,
the
way
the
guidelines
worked
was
that
the
base
offense
level
for
a
money
laundering
crime
was
not
tied
to
the
offense
level
for
the
underlying
offense.
so
it
was
set
i
think
starting
at
23
for
promotional
money
laundering.
but
what
happened
in
2001
is
that
the
commission
changed
the
rules
so
that
when
you...
when
the
money
laundering
involves
the
person
who
participated
in
the
underlying
offense
and
has
also
done
the
money
laundering,
you
start
with
the
offense
level
for
the
underlying
offense
and
then
you
make
some
minor
increases
depending
upon
the
type
and
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
because
he
does
engage
in
something
more
than
what
he
needs
to
do
to
be
punished
for
the
underlying
offense,
and
that
conduct
is...
and
that
conduct
is...
promotes
ongoing
crime
or
can
conceal
ongoing
crime
in
ways
that
are
just
what
congress
was
getting
at
in
the
statute.
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--because...
well,
that's
one
thing,
but
the
other
thing
is,
your
honor,
if
i
could
talk
about
the
ways
that
the
proceeds
definition
just
doesn't
make
sense
here.
if
these
expense
payments...
the
expense
payments
for
instance,
the
payment
of
the
salary
that
mr.
santos
made
to
mr.
diaz...
it
happens
in
this
very
case,
although
we
didn't
prosecute
it
as
concealment
money
laundering...
that
he
recorded
those
payments
as
salary
payments
by
a
printing
business
that
he
owned.
and
he's
doing
that
to
conceal
the
activity,
to
enable
it
to
keep
going.
and
that's
just
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
in
the
statute.
wouldn't
be
covered
under
a
profits
definition.
if
criminals
concealed
the
gross
receipts
temporarily
until
they
pay
the
expenses...
for
instance,
if
a
gambling
operator
takes
the
money
that...
his
illicit
receipts
from
the
gambling,
and
he
puts
it
in
the
bank
account
of
the
printing
business.
and
then
later
he
uses
it
to
pay
the
winning
betters,
he's
doing
that
to
hide
it
so
the
gambling
operation
can
keep
going.
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
here.
that
wouldn't
be
covered.
that...
that
evades
detection
just
as
much
as
transactions
that
hide
profit.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
but
the
conduct,
the
concealment
conduct--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
concealment
conduct
is
additional
conduct,
and
it
is
what
congress
wanted
to
get
at
here,
and
a
profits
definition
would
mean
that
it
is
excluded
from
the
statute.
and
it
would
exclude
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
guess
if
you
don't
think
that
concealing
expense
payments
should
be
covered,
if
you
don't
think
concealing
money
that
is--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it's
not
a
question
of
advertising
them,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
question
of
advertising
them,
but
it
is
a
question
of
taking
additional
conduct
to
conceal
them.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
is
additional
conduct.
he
didn't
need
to
record
it
on
the
books
of
the...
on
the
books
of
his
printing
business.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
additional
conduct,
but
it's
not
designed
to
conceal
the
unlawful
nature--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
might
like
to
keep
my
money
in
the
cookie
jar...
and
it's
perfectly
legitimate
money,
your
honor...
because
i
don't
want
when
someone
comes
into
my
house
that...
for
them
to
steal
the
cash.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
he
takes
the
money,
your
honor,
and
he
structures
his
payments
to
his
employees
by
making
them...
or
to
his
suppliers,
by
making
them
in
$9,000
increments
in
order
to
evade
transaction
reporting
requirements,
that
wouldn't
be
covered
either
under
this
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
there
are
many
situations,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
in
which
a
profits
definition
isn't
going
to
be
enough
to
solve
it.
for
instance,
just
a
drug
dealer
accepts
payment
for
the
drugs.
if
that
money
exceeds
the
cost
of
the
business,
it
would
presumably
be
profit
and
without
some
other
requirement
in
the
statute,
it
would
count
as
money
laundering.
and
for
instance,
when
street-level
dealers
that
are
employed
by
a
drug
kingpin
turn
the
receipts
over
to
the
kingpin
even
after
they've
take
out
their
share,
let's
say...
under
a
profits
definition
if
those
receipts
exceeded
the
costs
of
the
business
that
would
also
be
covered
as
money
laundering.
so
i
think
it's
very
true
that
the
profits
definition
isn't
going
to
solve
all
the
problems
as
well.
that's
a...
you
know...
another
point
about
it.
it
also
means
that
what
we
have
to
prove
profits
that
that's
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
us
to
do
even
in
cases
that
don't
involve
these
expense
payments
because
criminals
often
don't
keep
accounting
records.
they
certainly
don't
keep
records
that
are
accurate
and
complete
and
decipherable
by
law
enforcement.
and
congress
recognized
the
lack
of
hard
evidence
of
criminal
profits,
and
for
that
reason
congress
provided
for
the
forfeiture
of
proceeds
rather
than
profits
in
the
rico
and
drug
forfeiture
statutes.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
congress
took
a
different
approach
here
in
the
money
laundering
statute,
two
years
later,
when
it
used
the
same
term
"proceeds".
there's
also...
there's
the
issue
of
the
uncertainty
that
would
be
created
by
a
profits
definition,
because
it
would
raise
all
these
questions,
and
there
are
no
accounting
rules
to
resolve
them.
and
even
the
court
below
acknowledged
that
it's
difficult
to
determine
what
is
and
isn't
net
income,
and
that
the
line
between
paying
expenses
and
reinvesting
that
income
is
murky.
and
i
don't
think
the
court
should
lightly
assume
that
congress
intended
a
definition
of
an
element
of
the
offense
that's
going
to
raise
these
numerous
issues
about
the
scope
of
that
essential
element
of
the
offense.
and
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
resolve
them
all
without
any
guidance
from
congress.
so
if
i
could
reserve
the
reminder
of
my
time.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
thank
you.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
thank
you.
if
i
could
first
address
the
reasons
why
this
court
should
not
decide
the
separate
transaction
issue
itself
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
it's
not
the
question
presented
here
which
is
limited
to
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
term
"proceeds".
respondents
didn't
present
any
alternative
question
in
their
briefs
in
opposition.
and,
in
fact,
they
don't
present
an
alternative
question
presented
even
in
their
briefs
on
the
merits.
they're
just
using
the
concern
about
merger
as
a
reason
to
decide
that
proceeds
means
profit.
the
separate
transaction
issue
was
decided
against
respondents
adversely
on
direct
appeal
in
the
febus
case,
as
my
brother
on
the
other
side
acknowledged.
and
those
kinds
of
issues
that
are
decided
adversely
on
direct
appeal
shouldn't
be
relitigated.
the
issue
wasn't
raised
in
the
separate
transaction
issue,
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
section
2255
issues,
and
wasn't
addressed
by
the
courts
below
in
these
collateral
proceedings.
at
most,
we
say
it
should
be
left
open
for
another
case
that
presents...
that
presents
the
issue.
beyond
that,
if
this
court
thought
that
something
should
be
left
open
for
the
court
below
to
address,
the
court
below
could
address
a
range
of
possible
ways
to
deal
with
ensuring
a
separation,
for
example,
justice
stevens's
suggestion
that
an
illegal
gambling
business
under
the
statute
itself
entails
the
payment
of
winners
and
the
payment
of
employees,
although
we
don't
think
that
it
does.
but
a
profits
definition
is
not
the
way
to
address
concerns
about
overlap
for
the
underlying
offense,
because
it
makes
no
sense
in
the
broader
context
of
the
statute.
it
would
create
significant
uncertainty
about
the
scope
of
the
statute
because
of
the
absence
of
accounting
rules.
it
would
make
proof
very
difficult
as
a
general
matter
because
of
the
absence
of
those
rules
and
because
criminals
often
don't
keep
accounting
records.
it
would
exclude
numerous
concealment
transactions
that
congress
had
no
reason
not
to
cover,
and
it
would
cripple
the
government's
ability
to
prosecute
professional
money
launderers,
which
are
really
a
significant
part
of
the
problem
that
congress
was
addressing.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
