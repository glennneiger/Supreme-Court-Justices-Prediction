it
is
hard
to
see
this...
that,
just
in
the
sense
of
laundering,
nothing
is
being
concealed.
they're
not...
the
money
that's
being
paid
to
the
runners
and
the
collectors,
it
is
an
ordinary
and
necessary
expense
of
the
illegal
business.
so
i
think
justice
scalia
was
emphasizing
that
this
is,
for
the
very
same
conduct
two
discrete
statutes,
one
with
much
heavier
penalties.
that
makes
it
odd,
too,
that
the
basic
gambling
statute
has
a
lower
penalty
than
this
money
laundering
statute,
and
yet
it's
the
same
conduct
that's
violating
both.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
qualification
that
judge
easterbrook
made
when
he
said,
at
least
where
the
crime
is
a
business-like
operation?
he
gave
the
example
of
gambling,
he
gave
the
example
of
selling
contraband.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
was
narrowing
his
definition
of
proceeds
to
cases
where
the
crime
is
not
robbery
or
a
one-time
event,
but
a
business-like
operation.

wouldn't
it
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
roberts,
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
was
following
a
precedent
in
another
case
and
it
thought
that
the
defendant
would
prevail
under
its
theory.
if
this
court
should
say
that
that
theory,
that
it's
profits
and
not
proceeds
that
matter,
wouldn't
it
be
appropriate
for
us,
if
we
don't
decide
the
question
ourselves,
to
remand
and
say,
seventh
circuit,
your
precedent
was
wrong;
but
you
could
consider
a
question
that
was
not
necessary
for
you
to
reach
because
you
had
your
precedent
on
the
profits
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robert,
may
i
go
back
to
something
you
said
about...
of
the
options
that
justice
breyer
mentioned.
you
said
the
way
to
handle
it
is
in
sentencing.
santos
was
sentenced
to
60
months
on
the
gambling
counts
and
210
months
on
the
laundering.
you
said
the
statute
has
been
changed.
so
what
would
be
the
sentence
under
the
statute
as
it
now
exists?
and
this
is
vastly
disproportionate.
60
months
for
gambling,
and
210
for
money
laundering.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
your
question
presented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
this
context.
there
is,
if
you
are
going
to
go
with
profit,
a
question
of
what
expenses?
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
of
working
with
a
net
proceeds,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
expenses
that
you
would
deduct,
and
the
hit
man
was
given
as
one
example.
you
said
no,
not
that
one.
but
salaries
to
the
runners,
yes.
to
figure
out
what
would
count
to
come
up
with
a
net
figure
is
the
least
difficult,
is
it
not?
