mr.
todd
g.
vare
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
ginsburg,
you
have
suggested
correctly
that
the
only
conduct
in
this
case
was
the
payment
of
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
of
the
business.
justice
scalia,
you
correctly
suggested
that
paying
off
winners
is
necessary
to
every
gambling
operation.
justice
breyer,
you
have
correctly
suggested
and
stated
that
the
money
laundering
statute
is
intended
to
punish
different
conduct,
different
criminal
activity
than
the
underlying
criminal
activity.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
i
think
that
that
is
not
necessarily
true.
the
merger
problems
would...
would
exist
except
for
the
"profits
definition",
certainly
on
the
facts
of
these
cases...
on
this
case.
on
this
case
the
only
facts
that
were
presented
by
the
government...
and
they
have
conceded
that
they
did
not
present
any
evidence
of
profits.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
yes,
your
honor.
there
would.
and,
in
fact,
justice
alito
also
correctly
suggested
that
the
reason
why
the
scialabba
panel
decided
the
"proceeds"
definition
is
profits
was
because
of
the
expansive
interpretation
and
application
of
the
other
aspects
of
the
statute,
and
that
they
were
left
with
essentially
no
choice.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
i
think
you're
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
and,
in
fact,
in
our
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert
in
this
case,
we
made
this
very
point
as
to
why
this
was
not
the
right
case
to
determine
all
of
these
issues,
and
particularly
the
burdens
that
have
been
presented
by
the
government.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
justice
kennedy,
in
the
briefing
in
the
opposition
to
cert
and
in
our
response
brief,
we
have
set
forth
distinct
arguments
that
there
are
not
separate
transactions
distinct
and
different
from
the
underlying
criminal
activity.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
that
was
presented
as...
that
was
presented
as
part
of
the
febus
decision
as
an
argument
that
those
transactions
did
not
constitute
distinct
and
separate
transactions
from
gambling.
that
was
presented
in
the
pro
se
petition
and
acknowledged
by
the
government
in
responding
to
the
pro
se
petition
below.
the
government
acknowledged
that
the
question
in
febus,
the
question
in
scialabba,
the
question
in
this
case
on
habeas
are
legally
and
factually
indistinguishable.
and
i
think
justice
stevens
has
suggested
that
all
of
this
is
inherent
in
the
question
presented.
a
fair...
it
is
fairly
included
because
to
look
at
the
statutory
context
of
the
word
"proceeds"
is
necessary
for
an
intelligent
resolution
of
the
meaning
of
that
word
as
well
as
how
it
plays
throughout
the
rest
of
the
statute.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
i
think
that
that
is
a
question
that
this
court
could
resolve
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
or--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--it
was...
it
was
raised
in
the
court
below
as...
as
inherent...
well,
it
was
certainly
raised
in
the
febus,
in
the
direct
appeal.
it
is
inherent
in
the
2255
petition
filed
pro
se
by
my
client,
mr.
santos.
it
was
acknowledged
by
the
government
that
these
issues
are
not
legally
or
factually
distinguishable.
and
again,
it
is
inherent
in
the
question
that's
presented.
the
money
laundering
statute
requires
conducting
a
financial
transaction
involving
the
proceeds
of
the
specified
unlawful
activity
with
the
intent
to
promote
the--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--absolutely
not,
justice
ginsburg.
it
is
not
our
question
presented,
but
we
do
feel
that,
even
in
answering
that
question,
whether
or
not
it
is
net
or
gross
does
require
looking
at
the
term
in
context.
and...
and
the
context,
we're
not
looking
at
a
different
statute.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
in
the...
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--in
mr.
santos'
brief.
and
the
question
presented
there
was--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--the
brief
in
opposition
on
the
very
first
page.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
no,
we
did
not...
in
the
opposition
to
the
cert
petition
we
did
not
present
a
different
question
presented
as
a
question
presented.
but
we
did
present
the
argument...
mr.
santos
did
and
mr.
diaz
did...
that
there
were
no
separate
transactions
that
promoted
the
carrying
on
of
the
specified
unlawful
activity.
rather,
all
that
the
government
had
presented
in
this
case
was
merely
conducting
the
illegal
gambling
business.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
any
case
you're
going
to
have
to
look
at
what
the
specified
unlawful
activity
is
in
the
context
of
a
money
laundering
prosecution,
because
that
is
part
of
the
context.
and
so
in
this
case
you
have
to
look
at
what
is
the
ordinary
conduct
of
an
illegal
gambling
business.
and
i
would
suggest
that
paying
off
a
hit
man
most
likely
would
not
fall
into
that
category.
but,
certainly,
as
many
of
the
justices,
including
justice
scalia
and
justice
stevens
and
others
have
suggested,
that
when
a
gambling
business
pays
off
its
winners,
that
is
inherent...
that
is
integral...
to
conducting
a
gambling
business.
it
is
not--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
say
that
neither
one
could
be
prosecuted
for
money
laundering
because
in
both
situations--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--when
in
both
situations
the
gambling
operator
is
simply
paying
off
ordinary
business
expenses.
just
the
collectors
who
are
part
and
parcel
of
running
the
illegal
gambling
business,
they're
one
of
the
participants.
and
that's
part
of
the
illegal
gambling
statute,
is
that
you
have
to
have
five
or
more
participants.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i...
what
i
believe
is
the
answer
to
your
question
is...
is
you
cannot
look
at
the
term
"proceeds"
in
isolation.
and
justice
breyer,
you
know,
suggested
that
the
reason
why
we're
even
here
today,
arguing
about
what
i
believe
is
just
absurd
and
unwarranted
results
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
is
because
the
courts
below...
and
the
government
has
proposed
expansive
interpretations...
the
courts
below
have
adopted,
in
some
cases
and
not
others,
these
expansive
interpretations.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
well--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--i
think
there
is
certainly
a
suggestion,
but
that
this
court
itself
has
made
recently
in
the
duke
energy
case,
that
a
term
can
have
multiple
meanings,
multiple
shades
of
meanings,
and
that
will
depend
upon
the
context.
so
you
have
to
look
at
the
context
and
the
specified
unlawful
activity
is
context.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we
adopt
a
definition
of
proceeds
as
net
profits
in
one
case
for
one
unlawful
activity
or
gross
profits
for
another
unlawful
activity
or
gross
receipts
for
another
one.
but
the
problem
that
we
have
presented
to
us
today
is
due
to
the
piecemeal
construction
and
application
of
this
statute
and--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--you
could
have--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--well,
you
can
have
a
gambling
business
without
runners
per
se.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
but
you
do
need,
justice
scalia,
you
do
need
five
or
more
participants.
and
the
courts
below
have
defined
participants
as...
as
owners
or
partners,
bartenders,
cocktail
waitresses,
doormen,
employees
of
the
business.
and
if
those
are
qualifying
participants
to
even
establish
the...
the
predicate
for
an
illegal
gambling
business,
then
those
participants
are
most
likely
going
to
get
paid,
and
if
they
get
paid,
then
that
is
simply
part
of
conducting
an
illegal
gambling
business.
i
think
the
fact...
i
mean,
the
fact
that
the
runner
in
this
case,
the
bet
collector,
mr.
diaz,
is
probably...
you
know,
illustrates
best
the
unwarranted
result
in
this
case.
mr.
diaz
did
nothing
more
in
this
case
than
collect
wages
of
about
$150
a
month
or
a
week,
something
along
those
lines,
for
simply
collecting
debts,
and
he
was
convicted
of
money
laundering
and
sentenced
to
9
years
in
jail.
mr.
santos,
my
client,
all
he
did
was
pay
winners
and
pay
those
bet
collectors
to
collect
debts,
and
he...
his
sentence
was
nearly
quadrupled.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
well,
i...
i
think
in
that
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would...
i
would
suggest
it
might
be
an
incomplete
hypothetical,
because
simply
paying
the
expenses
of
a
crime
or
simply
buying
more
drugs
is
not
in
and
of
itself...
and
i
think
the
government
has
conceded
that
in
their
opening...
that's
not
in
and
of
itself
money
laundering.
there
has
to
be
a
transaction
that
is
conducted
with
the
intent
to
promote
the
carrying
on
or
separately
a
transaction
that
is
designed
to
conceal
the
legitimate
or
the
illegitimate
source
of...
of
the
funds
received.
so
simply
receiving
proceeds
from
an
unlawful
activity
is
not
enough.
and
that's
clear
on
the
statutory
language.
you
either
have
to
have
some
promotion
element
or
some
concealment
element.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
well,
justice
alito,
i
don't
think
it's
an
impossible
situation,
number
one,
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
second.
to
address
your
first
question,
could
congress
have
intended
this
to
mean
profits
knowing
that
the
burdens
were
so
difficult?
to
answer
that
question,
then
you
must
look
at
what
else
congress
intended,
and
there's
no
question
that
congress
intended
to
punish
different
conduct
than
the
underlying
criminal
activity.
and
then
you
have
to
look
at
what
congress
intended
to
get
at
when
they
wanted
to
fill
the
gap
in
criminal
law,
when
they
want
wanted
to
punish
crimes
that
were
not
previously
punished.
they
focused
on
getting
at
ill-gotten
gains
of
criminal
enterprises.
they
focused...
and
our
briefs,
you
know,
set
forth
the
statements
that
are
replete
through
the
debates
on
the
floor,
that
the
congress
was
focused
on
profits
of
criminal
enterprises.
congress
was
not
focused
on
the
unprofitable
criminal
enterprise
because--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--absolutely,
justice
alito.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
and
the
proof
problem--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--well,
justice
scalia,
the
intent
or
the
knowledge
or
the
scienter
requirement
is
going
to
be
present.
it's
going
to
be
a
burden
on
the
government
to
prove,
no
matter
what
definition
of
proceeds
is.
but
in
terms
of
proving
profits,
the
government
is
able
to
prove
profits
in
other
criminal
financial
transaction-type
cases
in
a
number
of
ways.
they're
not
limited
to
a
particular
accounting
method.
they
can
choose
the
accounting
method
that
they
want.
they're
not
limited
to
looking
at
day
after
day
after
day,
week
after
week
after
week
of
financial
records.
they
can
aggregate
records
that
are
selected
from
particular
points
in
time.
and
even
in--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
my
point
would
be
the
government
would
not
even
need
to
look
at
a
fiscal
year
to
prove
profits.
they
would
be
able
to
look
at
a
period
of
time
and
through
their
extensive
search
and
seizure
efforts--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--that
may
be
the
case.
they
may
have
a
difficult
burden
of
proving
profits
in
the
early
stages,
but
most
of
these
prosecutions
practically
occur
after
a
period
of
time.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
certainly,
based
upon
the
profits
in
the
first
month.
they're
not
limited
to
that.
i
mean--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--and
they
could
profit
on
that
one
good
day
if
there
are
other
transactions
involved
in
the
profits.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
i
don't
think
that
that--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
that,
under
that
hypothetical,
even
the
government
would
charge
those
criminals
with
money
laundering.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
well,
if
there's--
mr.
todd
g.
vare
--simply
giving
money
to
somebody
else
does
not
meet
the
concealment
and
disguisement
element.
i
mean,
there
has
to
be
an
effort
made
to
disguise
the
source
of
the
income
as
being
illegitimate.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
i
suppose
i
would
say
no.
and
i'm
going
to
explain
why
i
have
to
say
no,
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
medical
word.
the
profits
construction
is
not
perfect.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
we're
here
today
because
it's
the
only
way
to
resolve
the
case
that
came
up
to
this
court
based
upon
the
expansive
interpretations
of
the
rest
of
the
money
laundering
cases.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
avoid
any
question.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
a
profits
construction
that
if
you
apply
the
traditional
rules
of
statutory
construction,
if
you
look
at
the
text...
the
word
itself,
"proceeds",
does
not
have
a
single
plain
meaning
as
gross
receipts.
it
is
ambiguous.
and
it
has
multiple
shades
of
meaning
depending
upon
the
context.
if
you
look
at
the
term
"proceeds"
in
context
then,
then
it
will
depend
upon
how
one
is
using
it.
if
i
were
selling
a
house,
and
i
asked
somebody
on
the
street
what
would
be
my
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
my
house,
in
that...
and
only
in
that
context,
some
would
say
it
is
the
gross.
some
would
say
it
is
the
net.
some
would
say
it
depends.
well,
it
depends
upon
what?
it
depends
upon
context.
that
is
included
in
the
question
presented.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
it
is
slightly
more
difficult
in
the
case
the
government
has
now,
which
is
really
no
difficulty
at
all.
i
think
that
it
would
depend
upon
the
unlawful
activity,
the
specified
unlawful
activity,
what
would
be
the
ordinary
expenses
associated
with
doing
that
crime.
and
lower
courts
are
well
equipped
and
juries
are
well
equipped
to
hear
evidence,
direct
and
circumstantial,
and
make
inferences
and
decide
those
issues.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
no,
i
don't
think
so
at
all,
justice
scalia.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
absolutely.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
but
i
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
parlays
into
whether
or
not
it
is
money
laundering
or
not.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
if,
for
example,
the
murderer
paid
the
hit
man
with
money
to
kill
somebody
and
then
paid...
you
know,
used
proceeds
from
the
insurance
premium
that
somebody
might
have
been
his
wife
or
her
husband,
and
used
the
proceeds
to
pay
off
the
money...
the
hit
man
for
the
next
crime
or
to
reward
him
or
something
else,
to
carry
on
the
business
or
used
the
insurance
proceeds
to
conceal
where
they
came
from,
then
i
think
you
could
create
a
hypothetical
situation
of
money
laundering.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
if
we
assume
the
expansive
interpretations
of
a
transaction
promoting
the
underlying
crime
that
have
been
presented
in
this
case
and
then
we
apply
the
profits
definition,
that
might
not
be
money
laundering.
but,
the
money
laundering
statute
is
not
designed
to
cure
that
evil.
that
evil
is
punished
and
punished
severely
by
the
murder
statute.
it
is
punished
as
the
underlying
crime.
and
so
in
this
case,
mr.
santos
and
mr.
diaz...
or
mr.
santos
was
punished
up
to
the
maximum
of
five
years
for
running
an
illegal
gambling
business.
he
didn't
do
anything
else
other
than
run
a
gambling
business.
and
so
i
think
the
point
is
at
the
end
of
the
day,
there
are
certainly
a
lot
of
hypothetical
situations
that
suggest
a
profits
construction
might
pose
some
burdens,
might
not
make
sense.
but
if
you're
going
to
look
at
the
burdens
on
the
government
in
terms
of
construing
the
term
"proceeds",
then
you
also
must
look
at
the
consequences
of
accepting
the
gross
receipts
construction.
and
i
think
at
the
outset,
nearly
every
justice
up
here
suggested...
well,
that
turns
every
illegal
gambling
business
into
a
money
laundering
violation.
the
government
has
no
answer
to
that.
under
their
interpretation
as
applied
today,
then
every
illegal
gambling
operator
will
be
guilty
of
money
laundering.
mr.
todd
g.
vare
well,
i
think
what
the
money
laundering
statute
was
intended
to
do
was
punish
different
conduct,
separate
and
distinct
from
the
underlying
crime.
and
that
different
conduct
is
inherent
in
conducting
a
financial
transaction
with
the
intent
to
promote
the
carrying
on
of
the
unlawful
activity.
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
parse
the
statutory
language
and
only
address
the
term
"proceeds"
irrespective
of
its
consequences.
in
fact,
i
think
the
questions
directed
to
me
as
to
the
harsh
consequences
on
the
government
approving
profits
shows
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
term
"proceeds"
in
its
context.
in
its
context
includes
not
only
the
burdens
on
the
one
hand,
but
it
certainly
includes
the
situation
we
have
here,
that
every
illegal
gambling
business
is
automatic
money
laundering.
and
that
is
not
what
money
laundering
statute
was
enacted,
it's
not
what
it
was
written
or
intended
to
address.
thank
you.
