chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-1005,
united
states
versus
santos.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
continue.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
know
you
weren't
done.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
answer
to
the
line
of
questioning
that
we
were
having
was
that
the
problem
would
still
be
there,
even
if
you
limited
this
statute
to
profits.
you
take
the
two
bank
robbers
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
the
one
that
robs
the
bank,
the
other
in
the
get-away
car.
if
before
the
robber
gave
the
money
to
the
person
in
the
get-away
car,
he
said,
now,
you
know,
i'm
keeping
$100
because
i
had
to
buy
the
gun
and
that
was
$100,
so
you
only
get
400,
so
it's
only
the
profits
that
they're
splitting,
you'd
have
the
same
problem,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
vare.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
didn't
justice
alito
correctly
suggest
that
these
merger
problems
would
still
persist
even
under
your
definition
of
"proceeds"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
i
mean
if
you
have
a
"profits"
definition
and
the
enterprise
has
profits,
all
of
these
problems
we've
been
talking
about
in
terms
of
the
merger,
as
i
call
it,
between
the
money
laundering
and
the
underlying
offense
would
still
be
there,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
didn't
see
that
you
presented...
a
separate
question
presented
in
your
opposition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
at
page
(ii).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
but
i
am
looking
at
the
orange
one,
not
the
red
one.
the
orange
one
is
what
we
have
before
us
when
we
decide
whether
or
not
to
grant
certiorari.
and
there
you
don't
have
a
different
question
presented.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
we
adopt
your
position,
we
will
have
to
decide
a
question
like,
for
example,
if
the
argument
is
i
didn't
have
any
profits
because
i
had
to
pay
$10,000
for
a
hit
man
to
kill
somebody,
we
would
have
to
have
a
judicial
decision
that,
yes,
paying
hit
men
is
the
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
in
carrying
out
illegal
gambling
operations,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
take
two
illegal
gambling
operations
that
are
identical
in
every
way
except
that
the
one
pays
the
runners,
you
know,
$200
a
week.
the
other
pays
the
runners
$500
a
week.
and
the
one
that
pays
$500
doesn't
make
any
profits
because
he's
paying
too
much
to
the
runners.
the
first
one,
the
more
successful
operation,
you
say,
can
be
prosecuted
for
money
laundering
because
its
has
profits.
the
other
one
doesn't.
so
incompetence
is
rewarded.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i'm
focusing
on
the
question
presented...
that
was
the
only
question
presented
when
we
considered
whether
to
grant
certiorari
by
either
of
the
parties,
and
that
focuses
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
"proceeds"
is
considered
gross
revenues
or
profits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
someone
who
simply
paid
off
whoever
it
is
that
ships
in,
you
know,
a
ton
of
heroin,
you'd
say
is
not
guilty
then?
same
thing.
i
mean,
you're
just
paying
off
the
people
who
engage
in
the
activities
that
are
necessary
for
the
continuation
and
promotion
of
the
illegal
enterprise.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
they
know
even
what
the
fiscal
year
of
these
enterprises
is?
i
mean
let's
suppose
you
have
some
costs.
they
have
to
buy
the
poppy
field
or
wherever,
but,
you
know,
over
3
years,
they're
going
to
make
a
lot
of
money.
you're
saying
you
can't
prosecute
them
in
year
2?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
is
the
profits
may
not
come
in
immediately,
even
though
the
underlying
activity
is
exactly
the
same.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
that's...
but
we
don't
try
to
solve
every
case.
we
look
at
particular
questions
presented.
and
maybe
there's
going
to
be
another
case
coming
up
in
which
the
issue
of
how
broadly
you
should
construe
promotion
is,
or
whether
you
should
have
a
different
definition
when
the
offenses
are
merged
or
not.
and
we'll
confront
that
when
it
gets
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
is...
maybe
your
best
argument,
but
your
argument,
anyway,
is
let's
avoid
this
question
because
of
these
other
mistakes
that
have
been
made,
mistakes
which
are
not
presented
to
us
on
the
question
on
which
we
granted
cert.--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
thought
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
insurance
proceeds
exceeded
how
much
he
had
to
pay
the
hit
man,
right?
let's
say
he's
not
doing
it
to
get
the
insurance
money.
it
just
so
happens
he
had
a
$50,000
policy
on
the
victim--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
he
just
wanted
to
commit
the
murder,
not
get
the
money.
and
so
he
pays
the
hit
man
$100,000,
he
gets
the
$50,000,
and
then
uses
it
for
all
these
other
activities,
you'd
say
no
money
laundering,
because
no
profits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
their
answer
was
the
money
laundering
statute
covers
a
whole
waterfront
of
activities
besides
illegal
gambling.
and
the
question
is,
what
did
congress
intend
when
they
passed
the
money
laundering
statute.
this
is
kind
of
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
the
tail
is,
well,
it
presents
these
problems
when
you're
talking
about
gambling
operations,
but
there's
a
whole
rest
of
the
dog
area
where
it
doesn't
present
a
problem.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
vare.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
