justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
got
that
point,
but
what
is
your
suggestion
as
to
how
to
deal
with
what
is
underlying
disturbing
me
and
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
others,
if
prima
facie
congress
did
not
intend
that
you
launder
money
where
the
activity
is
an
essential
part
of
the
underlying
crime
itself?
and
there
are
three
ways
of
dealing
with
that:
one
is
this
gross
receipts
method,
which
has
the
defects
you
mentioned.
the
second
is
a
definition
of
"promotion"
which
says
when
you
promote
a
crime
that's
different
from
engaging
in
the
crime.
and
the
third
is
sentencing;
because
it's
a
real
offense
sentencing
method
and
where
what
you've
done
is
nothing
more
than
the
underlying
crime,
the
sentence
should
be
nothing
more
than
the
underlying
crime.
i
see
three
ways
to
get
to
the
same
problem,
and
you're
asking
us
to
decide
them
piecemeal,
yet
they're
related.
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
still
your
answer
leaves
me...
and
i
have
no
answer
to
this;
i
want
yours.
i
want
you
to
see
that
i'm
in...
at
risk
here
as
a
judge
of
getting
whipsawed,
that
i
first
decide
this
case
for
you;
and
the
next
case,
all
kinds
of
arguments
appear
that
i
hadn't
thought
of;
and
then
the
third
case,
again.
but
if
i
could
have
them
somehow
together,
i
could
look
at
the
least
evil
way
or
the
most
efficient
way
of
achieving
the
congressional
objective.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
it
in
front
of
me
actually.
i
was
looking
at
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
what
it
assumes
is
that
the
underlying
offense
is
different
from
the
money
laundering.
and
do
you
have
any
rationale
at
all
as
to
why
this
individual,
if
it's
true
that
he
did
nothing
more
than
engage
in
the
underlying
offense,
why
should
he
receive
one
day
more
than
60
months?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is
can
you
violate
the
statute
by
financial
transactions
which...
have
you
promoted
the
crime,
when
those
transactions
are
no
more
than
part
of
the
crime
itself?
that's
basically
the
question.
and
i
think
justice
kennedy
is
asking
if,
in
fact,
we
wanted
to
reach
that
question,
is
this
a
case
in
which
we
could
do
it,
through
reargument
or
in
some
other
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
was
it
raised
in
the
court
below?
