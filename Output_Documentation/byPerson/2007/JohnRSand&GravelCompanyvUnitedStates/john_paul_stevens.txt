paul

mr.
stewart,
can
i
ask
you
this
question:
do
you
think
the
defense
of
the
equitable
tolling
would
be
available
under
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
irwin
even
changed
the
equitable
tolling
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
with
justice
rehnquist's
sentence:
"we
think
this
case
affords
us
an
opportunity
to
adopt
a
more
general
rule
to
govern
the
applicability
of
equitable
tolling
suits
against
the
government"?
is
there
an
implied
exception
for
soriano
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
i
think
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
i
thought
that
the
government's
distinction
of
soriano
was
that
was
the
general
rule
for
equitable
tolling,
so
it
doesn't
apply
here,
which
i
think
is
certainly
understandable.
but
you're
saying
it
wasn't
even
a
general
rule
for
equitable
tolling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question,
mr.
stewart.
supposing
we
didn't
have
any
precedent
at
all,
just
the
whole
--
this
is
the
first
time
this
issue
had
arisen,
and
we
have
the
plain
language
of
this
statute.
would
you
not
read
this
statute,
without
any
background,
supporting
your
opponent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
read
the
plain
language,
you
left
out
the
words,
"of
which
the
united
states
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction."
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
because
it
said
it
in
a
case
--
the
issue
in
the
case
was
whether
franconia
was
overruled
--
i
mean,
soriano
was
overruled.
and
justice
white
thought
it
was.
he
said
so
in
so
many
words.
and
it's
interesting
that
justice
rehnquist
in
the
majority
didn't
disagree
with
that.
rather,
he
cited
justice
white's
dissent
as
part
of
his
description
of
why
some
statutes
are
different
from
others,
then
comes
to
the
points
that
we
want
to
adopt
a
general
rule
that
applies
to
all
statutes.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
implicit
--
in
his
opinion
he
did
not
disagree
with
justice
white's
characterization.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
interesting
part
about
this
is
the
discussion
of
the
majority
of
this
case
is
part
of
its
development
of
the
fact
that
we've
got
cases
all
over
the
lot
and
we
want
to
adopt
a
clear
rule
to
apply
across
the
board.
so
it's
part
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
last
question:
we
disagreed
on
parts
of
the
irwin
opinion,
but
i
take
it
you
would
agree
with
me
that
the
government
was
particularly
well
represented
in
that
case,
wouldn't
you?
(laughter.)
