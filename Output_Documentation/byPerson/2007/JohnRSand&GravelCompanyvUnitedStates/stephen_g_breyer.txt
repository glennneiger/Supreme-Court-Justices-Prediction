justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
suggest
we
write
the
opinion?
if
you
were
writing
it
and
then
a
dissent,
say,
or
someone
or
we
read
in
the
briefs
that
here
is
an
absolute
holding
of
the
supreme
court
right
on
point,
totally
clear,
says
just
exactly
what
the
government
says
here,
and
it
was
codified
in
1948,
and
now
we
say
the
reason,
despite
that,
you
win
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
somebody
says,
well,
the
court
couldn't
have
been
clearer
as
to
what
the
statute
meant,
and
congress
reenacted
it
in
codifying
it.
so
what
do
you
want?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
what
could
be
clearer?
are
they
supposed
to
actually
--
in
the
recodification
in
19
--
or
is
it
that
the
recodification
changed
things
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
even
all
those
cases
which
you're
going
back
to,
what
you're
talking
about,
i
think,
in
those
cases
is
general
statements
in
the
case.
the
cases
themselves,
except
possibly
for
that
franconia,
which
has
a
different
problem
because
it
was
about
accrual,
the
cases
themselves
don't
involve
this
statute.
it's
simply
general
statements.
i
thought,
and
i'd
like
your
response,
that
in
this
court's
opinion
as
in
statutes,
as
in
life.
when
people
make
general
statements,
they
don't
mean
every
possible
situation
in
the
universe;
rather,
there
are
always
circumstances
to
which
the
statement
doesn't
apply.
and
so
why
don't
we
just
read
those
statements
as
incorporating
a
prior
explicit
holding
of
the
court
as
inapplicable
to
that
prior
explicit
holding?
i
mean,
that's
what
you'd
normally
do
with
a
sentence
like
that,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that
isn't
--
i
don't
think
it's
quite
--
putting
the
argument
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
say
let's
look
at
irwin,
and
we
read
it,
so
it's
in
your
mind.
now
think
of
that
set
of
statute
of
limitations,
the
federal
ones,
the
government
ones,
that
are
either
just
as
ambiguous
as
irwin
or
even
more
ambiguous.
think
of
that
set.
now,
in
irwin
the
court
says
in
the
absence
of
special
circumstances
that
whole
set
is
going
to
be
interpreted
as
nonjurisdictional.
that's
what
it
says.
so
you
say,
well,
what
irwin
didn't
talk
about
is
suppose
there's
a
member
of
that
set
where
previously
the
court
had
held
it
was
jurisdictional.
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
to
do.
shall
we
read
it
as
an
exception
or
shall
we
not?
and
so
what
they
are
saying
is,
don't
read
it
as
an
exception.
there's
no
need
to
do
so.
congress
probably
never
really
thought
about
any
of
this
stuff.
read
it,
irwin,
as
including
that
one,
too.
so
what
do
you
think
of
that
point,
whether
it's
theirs
or
not,
leaving
aside
the
argument
about
whether
this
particular
statute
does
or
does
not
fall
within
that
set?
assume
it
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
absolutely
right,
and
then
the
question
is
does
the
simple
fact
that
we
previously
held
to
the
contrary
count
as
a
rebuttal?
does
irwin
mean
to
--
see
that's
the
same
question
i
had
before,
so
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
statute
of
limitations
that
governs
this
case
is
a
special
statute
aimed
just
to
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
it
has
â€“
it's
a
six-year
statute
in
the
actions
timely
only
if
it's
brought
within
six
years
after
the
time
that
litigants
claim
accrues.
now,
here
in
the
lower
courts,
united
states
in
effect
conceded
that
the
litigant's
claim
was
timely
and
when
it
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
united
states
said
nothing
about
it.
normally,
if
a
litigant
doesn't
say
anything
about
it,
it's
waived,
but
here,
the
appellate
court
raised
the
timeliness
issue
on
its
own,
and
decided
that
the
litigant
was
out
of
luck,
his
claim
was
too
late.
so,
we
have
to
decide,
even
though
the
normal
rule
is
if
the
government
will
defend
as
defendant
says
nothing
about
the
matter,
it's
waived,
forget
it,
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
particular
statute
at
issue
here,
this
court
of
claims
statute
is
special
in
this
respect
and
it
requires
a
dismissal
of
an
untimely
claim
even
though
the
defendant
never
said
anything.
that's
how
we
take
the
case.
now,
we
hold
that
the
statute
of
limitations
governing
the
court
of
claims
is
special
and
it
does
require
the
dismissal.
well,
why?
because
in
a
string
of
cases
beginning
in
1883,
the
court
has
basically
said
that
and
held
that.
for
example,
a
long
time
ago,
hundred
--
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago,
it
said
it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
of
claims
to
raise
the
limitations
question
whether
in
effect,
the
defendant
did
this,
raised
it
or
not.
the
petitioner
says
that
we
overturn
these
cases
in
irwin
versus
department
of
veterans
affairs,
a
case
we
decided
in
1990.
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
irwin
does
take
a
different
approach
towards
interpreting
statute
of
limitations
affecting
the
government,
but
we
don't
agree
that
irwin
overruled
our
earlier
cases
interpreting
this
particular
statute
nor
do
we
think
we
should
now
overrule
those
earlier
cases.
it
may
be
that
when
you
look
at
irwin
and
then
you
look
at
the
earlier
cases,
the
earlier
cases
do
seem
anomalous,
but
still,
principles
of
stare
decisis
convince
us
we
should
not
overturn.
justice
brandeis
once
observed
that
in
most
matters,
it
is
more
important
that
the
applicable
rule
of
law
be
settled
than
that
it'd
be
settled
right.
and
to
overturn
a
set
of
decisions
settling
one
matter
of
the
kind
that
justice
brandeis
was
talking
about,
simply
because
we
might
believe
that
that
decision
is
no
longer
right
and
we
can
get
a
better
one
now,
would
inevitably
reflect
the
willingness
to
reconsider
other
matters
of
the
same
kind
and
that
willingness
could
itself
threaten
to
substitute
disruption
and
confusion
and
uncertainty
for
what
the
law
needs
in
terms
of
stability.
we
find
nothing
in
this
case
sufficient
to
overcome
these
general
considerations
and
for
that
reason,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
ginsberg
has
joined
and
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
