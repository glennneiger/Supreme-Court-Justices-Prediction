did
the
prior

have
a

structure?
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
held
this
thing
is
jurisdictional
for
a
long
time.
did
the
prior
statutes
under
which
we
made
those
holdings
have
a
different
structure?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
all
of
those
factors
are
a
lot
more
subtle
than
the
mere
fact
that
we
have
said
that
this
is
jurisdictional
for
years
and
years,
it
and
its
predecessor.
why
--
why
isn't
that
at
least
as
persuasive
as
the
--
as
the
fragile
attachments
you're
--
you're
discussing
here
or
even
as
the
--
as
the,
you
know,
the
--
even
if
the
statute
said
that
it's
jurisdictional,
we've
said
in
our
opinions
that
to
say
it's
jurisdictional
doesn't
mean
that
it's
jurisdictional
necessarily.
so
i
suppose
we
could
say
the
same
about
the
statute,
couldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
say
that.
you're
saying
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
haynes,
isn't
it
less
radical
and,
indeed,
more
in
accord
with
the
language
of
irwin
to
--
to
say
that
what
irwin
overruled
was
not
the
whole
principle
that
this
statute
of
limitation
is
--
is
--
and
others
that
relate
to
sovereign
immunity,
is
jurisdictional,
but
rather
the
much
more
limited
rule
that
--
that
statutes
of
limitations
which
are
jurisdictional
are
not
subject
to
equitable
tolling?
that's
a
much
more
limited
point,
and
--
and
the
language
of
irwin
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
must
be
unequivocally
expressed
once
congress
has
made
such
a
--
once
congress
has
made
such
a
waiver,
we
think
that
making
the
rule
of
equitable
tolling
applicable
to
suits
against
the
government
in
the
same
way
that
it
is
applicable
to
private
suits
amounts
to
little,
if
any
--
little,
if
any
--
broadening
of
the
congressional
waiver.
i
don't
think
one
can
say
that
if
you
expand
the
principle
to
cover
the
whole
--
the
whole
matter
of
whether
it's
jurisdiction.
so
why
not
read
irwin
more
moderately
to
--
to
--
if
we
have
to
overrule
one
of
two
things,
the
whole
doctrine
of
the
jurisdictional
nature
of
statutes
of
limitations
in
sovereign
immunity
cases
and
the
other
is
simply,
oh,
yes,
there
is
sovereign
immunity,
but
can
there
be
equitable
tolling,
why
shouldn't
we
adopt
the
more
limited
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
usually
count
on
the
government
to
file
the
canned
sovereign
immunity
brief.
(laughter.)
