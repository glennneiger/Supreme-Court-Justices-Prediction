justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
rule
or
the
presumption
that
you
just
quoted
in
effect
when
congress
last
revised
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
can
--
was
congress
aware
of
that
general
rule
when
it
last
revised
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't,
either,
and
that's
why,
when
you
say,
well,
it's
a
general
rule,
well,
your
argument
tends
to
lose
force
because
of
the
fact
that
congress
acts
against
the
background
of
what
this
court
has
stated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
--
that
assumes
that
the
government
has
waived
in
every
case.
if
it
hasn't
waived,
i
have
to
do
it
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they,
if
they
raise
the
defense
--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--
then
you're
going
to
have
to
determine
it
anyway,
subject
to
clearly
erroneous
findings
of
fact,
as
to
when
the
person
entered
the
property
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
aren't
statutes
of
limitations
generally
more
equivocal
than
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
go
back
to
the
answer
you
gave
justice
stevens
when
he
asked
you
to
assume
that
there
was
no
precedent,
we're
reading
this
as
an
original
matter.
i
thought
your
answer
to
him,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
was
that,
well,
in
any
event
"shall
be
barred"
means
that
it
can't
be
waived
anyway.
but
statute
--
i
looked
up
other
statutes
of
limitations,
and
other
statutes
of
limitations:
"shall
not
be
entertained,"
"may
not
be
commenced,"
"may
not
be
brought."
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
response
was
all
statute
of
limitations
say
that
and
all
statute
of
limitations
can
be
waived.
