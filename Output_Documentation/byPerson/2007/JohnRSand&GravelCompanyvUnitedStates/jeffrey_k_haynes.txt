mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
plain
english
reading
of
section
2501
of
title
28,
its
phrasing
compared
to
the
jurisdictional
grants
to
the
court
of
federal
claims,
the
contemporaneous
legal
history
of
its
predecessor,
and
this
court's
decisions
in
irwin
and
franconia
associates
compel
the
conclusion
that
section
2501
does
not
limit
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
should
be
applied
to
the
government
as
an
ordinary
waivable
affirmative
defense.
the
plain
text
of
section
2501,
which
reads
"every
claim
of
which
the
united
states
court
of
federal
claims
has
jurisdiction
shall
be
barred
unless
the
petition
thereon
is
filed
within
6
years"
after
it
first
accrues,
assumes
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
if
it
assumes
subject
matter
jurisdiction
it
cannot
logically
limit
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
statute
is
phrased
in
such
a
way
that
the
jurisdictional
inquiry
precedes
the
inquiry
as
to
timeliness.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
the
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
the
1863
statute
prior
to
the
tucker
act
amendment
to
the
statute
had
approximately
the
same
structure,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
your
honor,
we
believe
that
this
court's
decision
in
irwin
effectively
overruled
soriano.
irwin
held
that
the
title
7
statute
of
limitations
was
subject
to
equitable
tolling,
and
in
irwin,
the
court
had
to
choose
between
two
lines
of
cases,
soriano
and
bowen
v.
city
of
new
york.
and
it
chose
the
bowen
line
of
cases.
and
so
if
it
repudiated
soriano
--
soriano
of
course
held
that
section
2501
is
jurisdictional.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
that's
correct.
but
certainly
in
irwin,
the
court
uses
2501
as
an
example
of
a
statute
that
can
be
equitably
tolled
and
in
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
yes,
section
2401
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
has
similar
language.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
well,
certainly
one
could
look
at
the
statute
of
limitations
in
2401
that
is
within
the
section
that
waives
sovereign
immunity
and
say
that
it
as
part
of
the
waiver
constitutes
a
limit
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
however,
section
2501
standing
alone
in
the
procedural
chapter
concerning
the
court
of
federal
claims
is
not
attached
to
any
particular
waiver
contained
in
chapter
91,
which
contains
the
jurisdictional
grants
to
the
court
of
federal
claims.
so
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
yes,
bowles
does
say
that,
but
bowles
can
be
distinguished,
i
believe,
in
several
ways.
first,
bowles
dealt
with
the
notice
of
claim,
notice
of
appeal
and
transferring
the
jurisdiction
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
not
at
issue
here
because
in
the
statute
of
limitations,
of
course,
we
aren't
dealing
with
transferring
jurisdiction,
we're
dealing
with
the
initiation,
the
initiation
of
the
claim
and
which
court
that
claim
belongs
in,
not
transferring
jurisdiction
from
one
to
another.
second,
bowles
--
bowles
was
very
careful
in
not
mentioning
statutes
of
limitations
in,
in
the
majority
opinion.
it
doesn't
mention
it
at
all
and
i
think
that
is,
that
is
purposeful.
third
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
i
think
if
congress
said
that
--
if
congress
specifically
said
that
this
section,
this
statute
of
limitations,
is
jurisdictional,
that
would
end
the
issue.
and
as
this
case
--
as
this
court
said
in
the
arbaugh
case,
if
congress
plainly
establishes
a
statute
as
jurisdictional,
then
the
court's
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
if
section
--
if
the
language
in
section
2501
were
attached
to
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
1491(a)(1)
for
this
case,
that
might
allow
the
court
to
find
that
it's
jurisdictional
and
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
but
certainly
the
example
--
as
the
chief
justice's
example
suggested,
in
2401,
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
also
the
statute
that's
found
in
the
quiet
title
act
that
this
court
interpreted
in
the
block
case,
block
v.
north
dakota,
those
statutes
of
limitations
are
attached
to
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
some
closer
fashion
than
2501
is,
and
so
they
would
more
likely
to
be
read
to
be
a
limit
on
jurisdiction.
i
think
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
the
irwin
case
answers
that
question
because
irwin
certainly
undercut
soriano
and
soriano
relied
on
the
kendall-finn
line
of
cases.
irwin
made
a
choice,
and
it
chose
to
say
that
the
statute
of
limitations
in
title
7
and
generally
other
statutes
of
limitation
are
presumed
to
be
equitably
tollable,
and
if
they
are
equitably
tollable
they
cannot
be
jurisdictional.
2501
was
used
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
yes,
we
are
saying
that.
we
think
that
there
is
a
logic
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
that's
correct.
and
if
it
--
if
the
statute
can
be
equitably
tolled,
it's
not
jurisdictional,
and
therefore
it
can
be
waived
and
--
and
it
does
not
have
to
be
raised
sua
sponte
by
the
court,
as
was
done
here
by
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
yes,
but
i
think
a
--
a
fair
reading
of
irwin,
combined
with
this
court's
decision
in
franconia
associates,
which
construed
section
2501
to
say
that
it
doesn't
have
a
special
accrual
rule
for
the
government
and
that
this
court
--
or
that
courts
should
apply
statutes
of
limitations
against
the
government
as
against
private
parties
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
it
would
be,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
which
case
you're
referring
to.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
no,
but
--
it
did
not
say
that
specifically,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
irwin
in
the
totality,
there
is
--
i
don't
think
there
is
a
way
that
you
could
look
at
irwin
and
say
that
it
did
not
overrule
soriano.
at
a
minimum
--
at
a
minimum,
it
took
out
the
theoretical
underpinnings
for
the
soriano
line
of
cases.
because
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
the
reason
is
because,
unless
the
congress
clearly
establishes
a
statute
of
limitations
as
jurisdictional,
unless
there
is
a
clear
statement,
then
statutes
of
limitations
against
the
government
are
to
be
read
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
well
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
no,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
the
recodification
changed
the
substance
of
the
statute.
however,
certainly
that
argument
that
congress's
recodification
of
this
court's
ruling
in
the
kendall-finn
line
of
cases
cuts
both
ways
because
following
irwin,
issued
in
--
when
the
opinion
was
issued
in
1990,
the
congress
has
had
17
years
to
look
at
that
and
say
no,
section
2501
should
not
be
equitably
tolled.
and
congress
certainly
could
say
that.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
i
think
the
recodification
argument
really
--
really
is
not
a
telling
argument
because
the
kendall-finn
line
of
cases,
under
irwin
at
least,
were
wrongly
decided
when
they
were
decided.
so
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
i
think
in
order
to
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
i
agree,
and
those
cases
start
with
the
kontrick
v.
ryan
case
and
continue
through
--
and
even
in
the
bowles
case,
that's
--
that's
a
species
of
appellate
jurisdiction
which
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
perhaps,
justice
breyer.
i
think
that
the
rule
that
we
are
proposing
here
is
that
once
congress
has
waived
sovereign
immunity,
absent
a
clear
statement
of
congress
to
the
contrary,
a
statute
of
limitations
is
not
--
does
not
limit
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
so
i
think
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
plain
language
of
section
2501,
compared
to
the
jurisdictional
grant
here
in
1491(a)(1).
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
no,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
presumption
was
--
was
established
certainly
in
irwin,
which
said:
we
want
to
cut
through
these
ad
hoc
decisions
that
we
have
been
going
through
on
this
question
of
equitable
tolling.
we
want
to
--
we
want
to
create
a
general
rule
that
statutes
of
limitations
generally
are
presumed
to
be
equitably
tolled.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
i
don't
see
how
that
could
happen,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
that
may
be.
however,
i
don't
think
that
that
general
codification
or
--
or,
rather,
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
says
that
the
congress's
codification
of
the
law
will
then
incorporate
this
court's
prior
decisions,
i
don't
think
that
can
trump
the
plain
language
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
well,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
this
court
can
adopt
a
more
limited
ruling
based
upon
the
rule
that
i've
advanced,
and
that
is
if
congress
specifically
says
that
a
statute
of
limitations
shall
count
as
jurisdictional.
and
the
example
i
would
give,
justice
scalia,
is
in
the
indian
tucker
act,
which
is
found
on
page
9a
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief.
the
indian
tucker
act,
section
1505
--
excuse
me
--
section
1505,
says
that
claims
that
accrue
to
indians
after
august
13,
1946,
go
to
the
court
of
federal
claims.
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
jurisdiction
over
those
claims.
that
is
--
and
before
that
date,
such
indian
claims
went
to
the
indian
claims
commission.
so
in
1505
congress
said
before
a
date
certain
a
particular
forum
had
jurisdiction;
and
after
a
date
certain
another
forum
has
jurisdiction.
that's
--
that's
a
jurisdictional
kind
of
date
that
i
think
is
--
is
appropriate
to
look
at
here,
because
once
--
once
you
put
an
--
you
put
accrual
language
in
a
statute
of
limitations,
that
by
its
nature
suggests
that
there
may
be
equitable
tolling
or
some
kind
of
tolling
if
you're
talking
about
a
claim
accruing,
because
there
may
be
estoppel,
there
may
be
waivers,
there
may
be
discovery
issues.
so
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
suggests
that
there
is
a
form
of
tolling
allowed
in
the
statute.
and
if
congress
wanted
to
say
that
this
statute
of
limitations
goes
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
it
very
well
could
have
said
that.
it
didn't,
however;
and
so
i
think
irwin
fits
comfortably
within
the
rule
that
we
are
suggesting.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
mr.
chief
justice,
it
certainly
was
not
the
rule
in
soriano
and
kendall.
but
our
position
is
that
in
kendall
the
court
ignored
the
legislative
history
which
said,
this
statute
of
limitations
that
we
are
inserting
into
the
1863
court
of
claims
act
should
be
treated
--
should
be
applied
to
the
government
just
as
to
private
parties.
that's
precisely
the
ruling
in
franconia
associates:
that
once
sovereign
immunity
has
been
waived,
once
--
once
there
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
government
is
treated
like
any
other
defendant.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
i
understand.
again,
i
suggest
that
irwin
erased
the
theoretical
underpinnings
of
the
kendall-finn
line
of
cases
by
saying
that
a
statute
formerly
--
which
this
court
formerly
said
was
jurisdictional
can
be
subject
to
equitable
tolling,
and
if
it
is
subject
to
equitable
tolling
it
cannot
be
jurisdictional
because
the
hallmarks
of
"jurisdictional"
are
strict
construction,
it
can't
be
waived
and
forfeited,
and
it
has
to
be
raised
sua
sponte.
and
so
if
you
take
out
one
of
those
legs
of
the
statute,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
held
to
the
jurisdictional.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
and
--
and
congress
has
specifically
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
the
kind
of
claim
involved
in
this
case,
which
is,
of
course,
a
takings
claim.
once
the
waiver
is
accomplished,
the
government
is
treated
like
any
other
defendant.
that's
certainly
what
franconia
associates
says,
and
i
think
it
is
inescapable
to
say,
to
--
to
conclude
other
than
to
say
that
irwin
and
franconia
have
--
have
eviscerated
the
kendall-finn
line
of
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
that's
what
franconia
ruled.
however,
franconia
reiterated
the
irwin
rule,
which
is
that
once
sovereign
immunity
is
waived
the
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
the
government.
the
government
in
franconia,
as
you
say,
was
pressing
a
very
novel
interpretation
of
the
first-accrued
language,
and
the
court
said
the
government
doesn't
get
any
advantage
from
that
just
because
it's
the
government.
so
just
because
the
--
the
government
is
the
defendant
doesn't
mean
that
it
has
that
special
advantage
once
sovereign
immunity
is
waived,
as
it
has
been
here.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
day
v.
mcdonough
does
not
help
the
government
here.
day
v.
mcdonough
said
that,
yes,
in
the
habeas
situation
the
district
court
might
raise
sua
sponte
the
timeliness
of
the
claim.
what
the
court
was
--
the
majority
was
clear
on
this,
and
the
three-member
dissent
was
also
crystal
clear
on
this:
that
if
the
government
waives
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
court
would
not
have
--
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
court
to
override
that
waiver.
so,
day
v.
mcdonough
actually
helps
our
position.
because
not
only
was
there
a
waiver
here
as
--
but
there
was,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
a
super
waiver,
because
the
government,
having
raised
the
statute
of
limitations
in
its
pleadings,
having
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
then
in
special
briefing
asked
by
the
trial
judge
here
agreed
that
the
claim
was
filed
timely
and
conceded
that
in
the
federal
circuit.
they
not
only
waived
it,
they
agreed
that
the
claim
was
filed
timely.
so,
day
v.
mcdonough,
i
think,
helps
our
position
and
not
the
government's
position.
and
that
was
made
emphatically
clear
by
at
least
eight
members
of
this
court
in
day
v.
mcdonough,
the
majority
and
the
three-member
dissent.
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make,
and
that
is
that
if
this
court
holds
that
the
statute
of
--
that
2501
is
jurisdictional,
then
the
judges
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
for
every
case
filed
in
front
of
them
on
their
general
jurisdiction
docket
have
to
--
will
have
to
scrutinize
the
allegations
in
every
complaint
to
determine
if
the
complaint
is
--
has
been
timely
filed.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
however
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
you
can
count
on
the
government
to
file
a
canned
affirmative
defense
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
too.
but
that's
true,
justice
kennedy,
if
the
government
has,
has
waived
it
then
the
court
doesn't
have
to,
wouldn't
have
to
do
that.
if
they
--
excuse
me,
if
they
raise
it,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
--
i'm
sorry.
if
the
government
raises
--
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
right.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
that's
correct.
but
even
if,
even
if
the
government
were
to
agree
that
the
claim
was
timely
filed,
the
judges
would
have
to
consider
it
sua
sponte
in
every
case.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
that's
correct.
but
even
if
it's
not
raised,
we
think
that
if
the
statute
is
held
jurisdictional,
then
the
courts
have
to
address
it
sua
sponte.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
k.
haynes
with
respect,
i
suggest
that
the
government
won
the
battle,
but
lost
the
war
on
irwin.
this
court
over
the
last
few
decades
has
attempted
to
bring
some
coherence
to
both
the
questions
of
sovereign
immunity
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
that
the
way
the
court
has
framed
the
issues
in
irwin
to
say
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
statutes
of
limitation
are
tollable
and,
therefore,
are
not
jurisdictional
in
our
view,
tends
to
show
that
the
court
wants
a
clear
statement
from
congress.
the
presumption
language
says
congress
may
at
any
time
say
otherwise
and
make
a
statute
of
limitations
jurisdictional.
unless
it
does
so,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
affect
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
my
brother
makes
the
argument
that
brockamp
rebutted
the
irwin
presumption,
but
it's
very
important
to
understand
that
the
brockamp
decision
did
not
speak
in
jurisdictional
terms.
it
spoke
in
a
--
a
mere
matter
of
statutory
--
not
"a
mere
matter"
--
it
spoke
in
terms
of
statutory
interpretation.
it
did
not
speak
in
jurisdictional
terms.
so
erwin,
standing
unassailed
since
that
time,
has
forced
the
courts
to
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
which
is
precisely
what
we
advocate
this
court
does.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
thank
you.
