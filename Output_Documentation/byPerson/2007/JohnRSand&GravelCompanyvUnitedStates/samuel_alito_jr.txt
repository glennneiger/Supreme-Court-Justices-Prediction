justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
kind
of
language
would
we
have
to
find
in
2501
in
order
to
conclude
that
it's
jurisdictional?
would
it
be
necessary
for
the
statute
to
say
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
unless
the
--
the
claim
is
filed
within
a
certain
period
of
time?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
necessary?
is
there
anything
short
of
that
that
would
be
sufficient?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doesn't
mr.
haynes
have
a
point
when
he
suggested
at
the
end
of
his
argument
that
questions
about
accrual
involve
much
more
complicated
factual
questions
than
are
usually
involved
in
deciding
whether
a
court
has
jurisdiction?
so
imagine
if
this
case
came
up
today
and
the
government
adhered
to
its
prior
position
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
still
it's
position
--
that
there
had
not
been
a
permanent
taking
until
1998,
would
the
court
--
and
none
of
the
events
that
happened
before
1998
had
been
brought
to
the
court's
attention
--
would
the
court
have
to
say
to
the
parties:
well,
this
is
fine;
we
see
that
there
was
a
fence
put
up
in
1998,
but
now
you
have
to
tell
us
everything
else
that's
happened
on
this
site
going
back
10
years
to
see
whether
there
--
whether
the
claim
might
have
accrued
at
some
earlier
point.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
if
you
didn't
think
it
was
--
it
was
a
good
argument.
would
you
have
an
obligation
to
say,
we
think
there
was
a
permanent
fence
put
up
in
1998
and
we
agree
that
there
was
a
taking
as
of
that
point,
but
we
don't
think
it
happened
earlier,
but
you
need
to
know
all
of
these
additional
facts?
would
you
have
an
obligation
to
present
that
to
the
court?
