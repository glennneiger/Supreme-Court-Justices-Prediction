mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
a
consistent
line
of
decisions
beginning
in
1883,
this
court
has
repeatedly
construed
the
6-year
filing
requirement
contained
in
section
2501
and
its
predecessors
as
a
nonwaivable
jurisdictional
limit
on
the
court
of
claim's
authority
to
enter
money
judgments
against
the
united
states.
congress
has
recodified
the
statute
on
various
occasions
and
has
modified
its
language
in
minor
respects.
but
it
has
made
no
change
that
could
call
into
question
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
don't,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
court
has
held
both
in
kendall
and
in
soriano
that
equitable
tolling
is
not
available.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
don't.
irwin
read
in
the
way
we
would
read
it,
established
that
at
least
with
respect
to
statutes
that
provided
for
private
suits
against
both
governmental
and
private
defendants,
and
perhaps
with
respect
to
suits
against
the
government
generally,
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
equitable
tolling.
but
the
court
in
irwin
recognized
that
that
presumption
could
be
rebutted.
and
in
both
kendall
and
soriano,
the
court
had
relied
on,
inter
alia,
the
fact
that
the
statute
listed
specific
instances
in
which
the
6-year
period
could
be
tolled
as
evidence
that
there
was
no
general
authority
to
toll
the
statutory
time
limit.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
beyond
the
seas
or
subject
to
a
legal
disability.
the
original
1863
version
of
the
statute
specified
particular
disabilities
such
as
infancy,
et
cetera.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
there
are
two
bases
on
which
we
would
distinguish
that
language.
the
first
is
by
its
terms
chief
justice
rehnquist's
sentence
was
addressed
to
equitable
tolling,
not
to
waivibility.
and
it's
true
that
the
court
in
bowles
has
linked
the
two,
but
it
doesn't
appear
that
the
court
in
irwin
made
that
equation.
that
is,
in
the
irwin
opinion
the
court
recited
the
fact
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
ordered
the
case
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
because
the
filing
requirement
had
not
been
met.
and
the
court
said,
we
think
that
the
statute
is
subject
to
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
was
at
least
a
general
rule
for
equitable
tolling
with
respect
to
statutes
like
title
7
that
authorize
suit
against
both
the
government
and
against
private
defendants.
and
there
has
been
some
back
and
forth
in
the
court
since
then
as
to
whether
the
irwin
language
extends
more
broadly.
in
brockamp,
the
court
suggested
that
some
private
analog
is
necessary
before
the
irwin
presumption
applies.
in
scarborough
versus
principi,
the
court
seemed
to
tilt
in
the
opposite
direction.
but
part
of
our
point
is,
even
if
the
irwin
presumption
of
equitable
tolling
extends
categorically
to
all
suits
against
the
government,
equitable
tolling
is
not
the
same
thing
as
jurisdictionality
or
waivibility.
the
court
in
bowles
did
link
the
two,
but
in
irwin
itself
the
court
recited
the
fact
that
the
lower
courts
had
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
and
then
when
the
court
concluded
that
irwin
had
not
satisfied
the
prerequisites
for
equitable
tolling,
the
court
simply
said:
affirmed.
now,
if
the
court
had
intended
in
irwin
to
establish
not
simply
that
equitable
tolling
was
potentially
available,
but
that
the
time
limit
was
not
a
jurisdictional
bar
to
begin
with,
it
seems
likely
the
court
would
at
least
have
referred
to
the
idea
that
the
dismissal
should
have
been
for
failure
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
court
has
said
both
with
respect
to
section
2501
and
its
predecessors
and
with
respect
to
statutory
time
limits
for
suing
the
government
generally,
that
the
terms
of
congress's
consent
to
suit
define
the
jurisdiction
of
the
reviewing
court
and
a
time
limit
for
commencing
suit
is
one
of
those
terms.
and
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
in
particular
to
united
states
v.
dalm,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
23.
it
was
decided
less
than
9
months
before
irwin
was
decided.
and
the
opinion
in
dalm
is
suffused
with
references
to
the
jurisdictional
character
of
the
time
limit
for
commencing
suit
against
the
government.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
obviously,
the
government
was
on
the
other
side
in
irwin,
so
in
a
sense
i'm
not
the
best
person
to
defend
the
court's
reasoning.
but
as
between
the
reading
of
irwin
that
would
create
this
anomaly,
that
there
could
potentially
be
a
jurisdictional
limit
that
was
nevertheless
subject
to
equitable
tolling,
and
the
argument
on
the
other
side
that
irwin
sub
silentio
swept
away
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
that
had
recited
that
the,
that
the
terms
of
the
government's
consent
to
suit
are
jurisdictional
limits
and
a
time
limit
is
one
of
those
terms.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
certainly
the
kind
of
case
that
the
court
was
specifically
dealing
with
in
irwin
itself,
and
it's
not
an
uncommon
type
of
case
now,
is
one
in
which
congress
has
passed
a
statute
that
imposes
obligations
on
private
parties
and
then
imposes
like
obligations
on
the
government.
and
the
gestalt
of
title
7,
once
it
was
amended
to
add
the
federal
government
as
a
potential
defendant
and
to
impose
the
substantive
obligations
on
the
government,
was
that
the
government
was
to
be
dealt
with
with
respect
to
matters
of
employment
discrimination
in
the
same
way
that
a
private
employer
would
be
in
like
circumstances,
and
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
in
franconia,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
different
question.
it
was
what
do
the
words
"first
accrues"
mean?
and
it
held
that
the
--
it
essentially
treated
the
phrase
"first
accrues"
as
a
term
of
art,
as
one
that
had
appeared
in
prior
statutes
governing
suits
against
other
defendants.
and
so
it
saw
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
those
words
to
mean
anything
different
in
section
2501
than
they
meant
in
other
statutes
of
limitations.
and
i
guess
the
other
point
that
i
would
make
both
about
franconia
and
irwin
is,
even
if
you
read
irwin
at
its
broadest,
even
if
you
construe
it
to
mean
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
time
limits
for
suing
the
government
are
nonjurisdictional
as
well
as
subject
to
tolling,
the
court
in
irwin
still
made
clear
that
the
presumption
could
be
rebutted.
the
presumption
is
not
a
limit
on
congress's
authority.
it's
simply
an
aid
to
construction
in
situations
where
other
tools
of
interpretation
don't
produce
a
clear
result.
and
here
we
would
say
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
wouldn't
read
it
to
--
if
all
we
had
was
the
text
of
the
statute,
we
would
not
read
it
to
permit
waiver.
and
i
should
explain
why.
the
statute
is
reproduced
in
pertinent
part
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
and
the
statute
provides
"every
claim
of
which
the
united
states"
--
"every
claim
of
which
the
united
states
court
of
federal
claims
has
jurisdiction
shall
be
barred
unless
the
petition
thereon
is
filed
within
6
years
after
such
claim
first
accrues."
and
looking
only
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
language
is
categorical.
it
says
every
claim
that
is
filed
more
than
6
years
after
accrual
shall
be
barred.
the
statute
by
its
terms
makes
no
exception
for
cases
in
which
the
government
fails
to
raise
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
i
think
often
statutes
of
limitations
are
written
like
that.
but
my
point
is
in
the
end
petitioner's
argument
really
is
not
a
plain
language
argument.
petitioner's
argument
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
can
understand
that
if
you
were
looking
only
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
you
would
say
--
you
might
say
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
bar
because
it
presumes
jurisdiction.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
with
respect
to
the
substantive
question
presented,
namely
whether
the
united
states'
failure
to
make
the
argument
in
a
timely
way
causes
it
to
be
waived,
the
statute
doesn't
support
petitioner's
position
as
to
that.
it
is
categorical.
it
doesn't
by
its
terms
carve
out
an
exception
for
cases
in
which
the
united
states
fails
to
raise
a
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
rule
8(c)
says
the
following
affirmative
defenses
shall
be
pled
in
the
responsive
proceeding,
and
it
lists
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
it
could
certainly
--
it
obviously
couldn't
supersede
the
decisions
of
this
court
or
even
of
the
federal
circuit
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
rule
basically
tracks,
although
not
precisely
tracks,
the
language
of
the
--
the
parallel
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
and
we
would
read
it
simply
to
mean
to
the
extent
this
is
an
affirmative
defense,
it
should
be
pleaded
initially.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
defense
is
waived
if
not
pleaded.
but
to
return
to
the
point
that
i
was
making
earlier,
in
the
end
petitioner's
argument
is
not
a
plain
language
argument.
petitioner's
argument
is
that,
notwithstanding
the
absence
on
the
face
of
the
statute
of
an
exception
for
cases
in
which
the
united
states
fails
to
plead
the
timeliness
defense,
this
court
should
read
section
2501
against
the
backdrop
of
a
large
body
of
law
holding
that
statutes
of
limitations
are
generally
waivable,
and
should
assume
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate
that
understanding
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
think
--
i
think
this
essentially
relates
to
the
point
that
i
was
making
that,
even
if
there
is
a
presumption
of
nonjurisdictionality
announced
in
irwin,
it's
rebuttable
and
the
presumption
is
simply
an
aid
to
construction.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
in
our
view,
yes,
it
does.
that
is
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
a
little
artificial
to
talk
about
what
language
congress
might
or
should
have
used
in
light
of
irwin
to
make
clear
its
intent
that
this
be
treated
as
jurisdictional,
when
congress
in
the
1948
judicial
code
chose
to
recodify
essentially
the
same
language
that
had
previously
been
construed
to
impose
a
jurisdictional
limit.
and
the
point
i
was
making
before
about
petitioner's
argument
as
to
imputed
congressional
intent
--
in
the
end
petitioner's
position
depends
on
the
inference
that
because
there
was
a
body
of
law
out
there
saying
that
statutes
of
limitations
are
ordinarily
waivable,
congress
should
be
assumed
to
have
intended
to
incorporate
that
body
of
law.
and
our
point
is
if
you're
trying
to
impute
congress's
intent
it
makes
much
more
sense
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
recodify
the
same
reading
that
this
court
had
attached
to
this
particular
provision,
not
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate
a
meaning
that
the
court
had
attached
to
other
statutes
of
limitations
that
the
court
had
specifically
distinguished
from
this
one.
and
it's
worth
emphasizing
that
the
decisions
in
kendall
and
finn
and
de
arnaud
can't
be
accused
of
the
sort
of
loose
or
less
than
meticulous
use
of
jurisdictional
language
that
this
court
has
recently
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
said
that
it
was
unexceptional
and
it
said
that
many
other
statutes
of
limitations
used
this
language,
namely
the
phrase
"first
accrues."
but
one
of
the
other
points
that
the
court
in
franconia
attached
significance
to
was
the
fact
that
the
court
of
claims
had
never
given
that
phrase
a
broader
reading
in
section
2501.
that
is,
the
court
cited
that
as
additional
evidence
that
the
phase
had
not
been
understood
in
this
particular
statute
to
bear
a
meaning
other
than
it
would
have
in
other
statutes
of
limitations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
principal
line
of
authority
in
the
federal
circuit
says
it's
jurisdictional,
but
what
can't
be
disputed
is
that
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
that
it's
jurisdictional,
and
the
court
has
again
not
used
those
--
that
term
in
passing.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
think
it
would
be
--
again,
given
the
fact
in
particular
that
the
court
in
irwin
didn't
speak
explicitly
to
the
question
of
jurisdictionality
one
way
or
the
other,
i
think
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
--
a
dissenting
opinion
to
make
assertions
about
the
reach
of
a
majority
opinion,
and
the
majority
opinion
sometimes
does
and
sometimes
does
not
respond
to
those.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
--
but
i
think
at
most
the
court
in
irwin
was
not
trying
to
adopt
a
clear
rule
across
the
board;
it
was
trying
to
adopt
a
presumption,
while
recognizing
that
congress
could
provide
in
individual
statutes
for
a
rule
different
from
the
one
that
the
presumption
would
suggest.
and
again
if
--
congress
had
already
been
told
that
the
language
it
was
using
would
be
treated
as
jurisdictional
--
and
the
court
in
the
kendall
line
of
cases
had
not
simply
used
the
label
jurisdictional;
it
had
said
statutes
of
limitations
governing
suits
against
private
parties
can
be
waived
if
they're
not
asserted
in
a
timely
fashion,
but
the
time
limit
for
filing
suit
against
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims
is
different.
this
is
a
limit
on
the
court's
authority
and
the
court
is
required
to
notice
it
whether
it's
pleaded
by
the
government
or
not.
so
i
think
congress
had
been
told
that
it
was
already
using
language
that
would
have
the
effect
of
causing
this
to
be
jurisdictional
and
nonwaivable.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean
--
i
think
--
i
think
you
may
well
be
correct,
that
is
perhaps
to
the
extent
the
drafters
of
the
rule
were
doing
something
other
than
simply
incorporating
the
existing
language
of
the
comparable
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure.
if
all
they
were
saying
was
if
there's
a
statute
of
limitations
out
there
that
would
function
as
an
affirmative
defense
in
our
cases,
in
our
court,
we
want
it
to
be
pleaded
immediately
as
it
would
be
in
a
private
civil
action.
if
that's
what
they're
saying,
you
may
well
be
right
that
the
class
of
cases
to
which
that
would
pertain
is
the
null
set
or
something
very
close
to
it.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
guess
we'd
have
two
or
three
responses
to
that.
the
first
is,
at
least
before
judgment
could
be
entered
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
the
court
would
ultimately
have
to
determine
not
only
that
there
was
--
had
been
a
taking,
but
would
have
to
determine
the
date
on
which
the
taking
occurred
in
order
to
award
compensation,
if
nothing
else.
so
this
seems
like
the
kind
of
question
that
would
ultimately
have
to
be
determined,
at
least
before
the
plaintiff
could
be
successful.
the
second
thing,
as
was
pointed
out
before,
at
least
in
the
majority
of
cases
where
there
is
a
viable
limitations
argument,
the
government
is
going
to
plead
it,
and
so
asking
the
court
to
look
beyond
this
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
would
depend
upon
the
court's
rules.
that
is,
if
the
court
required
a
separate
statement
as
to
jurisdiction
then
probably
the
advocate
would
include
at
least
a
thumbnail
sketch
of
the
relevant
facts.
if
it
was
--
if
the
rules
of
the
court
were
such
that
the
advocate
didn't
have
to
address
jurisdiction
unless
he
or
she
was
actively
contesting
it,
then
no.
but
the
--
i
guess
the
more
fundamental
point
we
would
make
is
the
speculation
as
to
disruptive
results
would
carry
a
lot
more
force
if
the
government
were
asking
for
a
rule
that
was
different
from
what
had
been
done
in
the
past.
that
is,
even
petitioner
would
concede
that,
for
the
great
bulk
of
the
country's
history,
this
rule
was
treated
as
jurisdictional,
and
petitioner's
argument
is
simply
that
that
line
of
authority
was
effectively
overruled
in
irwin
in
1990.
and
so
if
in
fact
treating
this
limit
as
a
jurisdictional
limit
would
have
the
effect
of
disrupting
litigation
in
the
cfc,
we
would
expect
the
petitioner
to
have
actual
evidence
to
that
effect.
if
we
were
asking
for
a
different
rule
than
had
been
enforced
in
the
past,
then
there
would
be
more
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
true
even
as
to
cases
involving
barriers
that
everyone
would
concede
are
jurisdictional.
for
instance,
there
are
cases
in
which
a
litigant
sues
us,
and
there
is
great
doubt
as
to
his
standing
to
sue,
and
it
may
be
an
issue
that
we
think
is
otherwise
framed
in
an
appropriate
context,
and
the
government
might
feel
that
it
would
be
to
everyone's
benefit
to
get
the
issue
resolved
when
--
one
way
or
the
other.
but
one
consequence
of
treating
that
as
a
jurisdictional
barrier
is
simply
that
the
government
can't
always
have
its
way.
so
i
don't
think
--
i
would
think
that
you
are
correct
that
there
might
be
some
instances
in
which
treatment
of
this
limit
as
a
jurisdictional
bar
would
not
be
in
the
government's
interest.
but
that's
not
a
basis
for
holding
it
to
be
nonjurisdictional.
certainly
the
majority
of
cases
involving
both
--
i
think,
involving
both
2501
and
other
provisions
that
impose
time
limits
for
suits
against
the
government,
in
which
the
courts
have
held
that
the
relevant
limit
is
jurisdictional,
typically
the
situation
arises
where
the
government
decides
to
make
an
argument
on
appeal
that
it
didn't
make
in
the
district
court.
i
think
a
case
like
this
one,
where
the
government
doesn't
argue
the
point
even
on
appeal
and
the
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
holds
that
the
suit
was
untimely,
those
are
the
rarity.
but
we
certainly
agree
that
the
logical
implication
of
treating
the
time
limit
as
jurisdictional
is
that
the
federal
circuit
did
the
right
thing
here.
i'd
like
to
say
a
couple
of
words
about
bowles.
i
think
bowles
doesn't
compel
a
ruling
in
the
government's
favor,
but
it
does
support
our
position
in
various
respects.
first,
as
the
chief
justice
alluded
to
earlier,
bowles
emphasized
that
time
limits
for
filing
notices
of
appeal
had
historically
been
treated
as
jurisdictional
limits,
and
the
court
said
that,
given
the
choice
between
calling
into
question
some
dicta
in
our
recent
opinions
and
effectively
overruling
a
century
worth
of
practice,
we
think
the
former
option
is
the
only
prudent
course.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
agree
that
the
court's
opinions
didn't
note
that
fact,
but
i
don't
think
that
fact
would
or
should
have
affected
the
treatment
of
the
statute
as
jurisdictional.
that
is,
once
it
was
brought
to
congress's
attention
that
there
was
a
potential
conflict
or
tension
between
the
language
of
the
jurisdictional
statute
and
the
language
of
the
corresponding
federal
rule,
congress
had
the
choice
to
make
as
to
which
should
govern,
and
if
congress
had
wanted
a
different
result
from
the
one
that
was
in
the
federal
rule,
it
could
have
enacted
different
language.
i
think
it
would
not
--
whatever
we
might
privately
think
is
the
level
of
attention
that
congress
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
my
point
is
that,
once
this
was
brought
to
congress's
attention,
congress
could
have
chosen
to
stick
with
other
language,
in
which
case
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
corresponding
rule
would
have
been
amended
to
fit
the
statute.
again,
whatever
level
of
attention
we
might
privately
think
that
congress
devoted
to
this
question,
the
fact
is
that
congress
acted
as
a
body,
passed
a
law,
it
was
signed
--
passed
statutes
in
both
houses.
it
was
signed
into
law
by
the
president.
and
from
that
point
forward,
it
was
a
statutory
rule
and
had
to
be
treated
as
such.
so
i
agree
that
this
aspect
of
the
problem
wasn't
addressed
specifically
by
the
opinions
in
bowles,
but
i
don't
see
any
basis
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
to
treat
it
as
a
conforming
statute
suggests
that,
in
some
way,
congress
was
obligated
to
do
what
the
advisors
told
it
to
do
or
was
obligated
to
conform
section
2107(a)
to
the
terms
of
the
federal
rule,
and
that's
not
the
case.
congress
could
have
--
once
this
matter
was
brought
to
its
attention,
congress
could
have
enacted
whatever
statute
it
wanted.
it
chose
to
enact
a
statute
that
tracked
the
preexisting
language
of
the
rule,
but
from
that
time
forward,
the
notice
of
appeal
deadline
was
grounded
in
statute,
and
it
was
a
statutory
limit
that
applied
to
bowles's
own
notice
of
appeal.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
a
basis
for
saying
the
case
would
or
should
have
come
out
differently
if
the
court
had
been
aware
of
the
history
of
the
statute's
development.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
my
point
is,
if
we
were
reading
the
statute
without
reference
to
any
precedent
addressing
either
2501
itself
or
statutes
of
limitations
generally,
kind
of
the
pure
myopic,
literal
reading
of
the
statute,
without
reference
to
the
legal
context,
would
suggest
that
"every"
means
every,
"shall
be
barred"
means
shall
be
barred,
and
there
is
no
exception
for
cases
in
which
the
government
fails
to
raise
the
argument
in
a
timely
way.
and
my
point
is
--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
my
point
is
there
is
no
basis
for
petitioner's
argument
that
in
inferring
congress's
intent
the
court
should
look
to
part
of
the
broader
legal
context,
namely:
decisions
of
this
court
and
others
that
have
dealt
with
the
general
treatment
of
statutes
of
limitations,
but
should
ignore
the
other
part
of
the
legal
context,
namely:
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
said,
squarely
and
unequivocally,
this
particular
time
limit
is
different.
this
particular
time
limit
is
nonwaivable
and
jurisdictional
even
though
most
statutes
of
limitations
can
be
waived
if
they
are
not
asserted
in
a
timely
way.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
government
could
not
have
been
better
represented,
your
honor.
(laughter.)
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
had
the
same
reaction
reading
the
transcript.
thank
you.
