justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
in
contracts
it
was
used
as
an
example
of
a
so-called
built-in
statute
of
limitations,
one
that
is
thought
to
bar
the
right
as
well
as
the
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
said
determining
when
and
under
what
conditions
federal
courts
can
hear
cases
falls
within
the
court's
adjudicatory
authority
--
or
that
are
within
the
adjudicatory
authority
are
jurisdictional,
when
and
under
what
conditions
federal
courts
hear
cases.
that
would
be
very
broad,
but
it
did
say
that.
could
not
interfere
with
the
plain-text
reading
of
2501
once
you
assume
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
there
would
be
a
built-in
limitation,
and
usually
that's
not
considered
jurisdictional.
it
would
be
under
the
heading
of
failure
to
state
a
claim;
that
is,
your
claim
has
been
extinguished,
so
you
have
no
claim
to
state,
as
opposed
to
the
ordinary
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
which
bars
only
the
remedy,
not
the
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
bowles
said
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
bowles
said
if
it's
equitably
tolled,
it's
not
jurisdictional.
if
it
--
a
provision
that
is
jurisdictional
cannot
be
equitably
tolled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
member
of
the
court
did
think
that
irvin
--
irwin
overruled
soriano,
but
only
one
member.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
just
irwin
or
a
whole
line
of
cases?
there
was
a
time
when
the
jurisdictional
label
was
used
rather
frequently.
there
is
a
more
recent
case
that
says
"jurisdiction"
is
a
word
of
many
meanings,
too
many
meanings.
and
i
think
the
court
has
been
trying
to
cut
down
on
the
too
many
meanings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
did
say
statutory
time
limits
--
this
is
irwin
--
applicable
to
lawsuits
--
well,
the
sentence
about
the
suits:
the
rule
of
equitable
tolling
applicable
to
suits
against
the
government.
it
says
the
rule
that
was
announced
is
applicable
to
the
government,
the
same
as
with
respect
to
private
parties.
so
it's
hard
to
think
of
what
territory
irwin
would
cover
if
it
doesn't
--
because
in
all
suits,
at
least
for
money
against
the
government,
there
has
to
be
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
--
even
if
you're
right,
couldn't
the
federal
circuit
say:
well,
that's
all
very
interesting
but
day
v.
mcdonough
told
us
that
if
we
want
to
raise
it
on
our
own
--
we
don't
have
to
if
it's
not
jurisdictional;
but
if
we
want
to,
we
can.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
certainly
would
be
mixing
categories
terribly
if
you
suggested
that
something
that
goes
to
the
court's
authority
to
proceed
in
the
case
can
be
waived
if
it's
equitable
to
waive
it.
i
mean,
those
two
notions
are
at
odds
with
each
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
would,
what
would
irwin
and
franconia
that
made
statements
--
when
it's
a
question
of
a
time
limit,
they
operate
against
the
government
just
like
they
operate
against
private
parties,
to
what
kind
of
case
would
that
apply?
i
mean,
it's
been
pointed
out
that
2501
covers
a
whole
slew
of
cases,
not
just
takings
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
--
what
about
the
rules
of
the
court
of
federal
claims?
rule
8(c)
states
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
an
affirmative
defense.
and
that's
in
suits
against
the
government
because
that's
all
the
court
of
federal
claims
deals
with.
so
to
what
would
that
rule
8(c)
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
those
statutes
of
limitations
would
be
statutes
of
limitations
operating
against
the
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say
that
franconia
did
use
loose
language,
because
although
it
dealt
with
accrual
--
when
does
the
claim
accrue,
and
not
when
is
it
cut
off
--
but
it
did
say,
it
called
2501
specifically
"an
unexceptional
statute
of
limitations."
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
we
looked
at
the
court
of
federal
claims
decisions
now,
i
think
they're
spelled
out
in
the
opinion.
they
go
both
directions.
that
is,
some
say
2501
is
jurisdictional,
some
say
it's
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
congress
think
that
rule
8(c)
has
no
range
of
application?
and
--
we
have
two
recent
statements
saying
statutes
of
limitations
against
the
government
are
like
statutes
against
private
parties.
but
if
2501,
which
covers
all
of
the
cases
over
which
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
jurisdiction
--
if,
if
it's
for
jurisdictional,
then
i
don't
know
what
cases
there
would
be
in
which
there's
a
time
limit
in
a
suit
against
the
government
that
isn't
jurisdictional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
do
know
the
cfc
is
at
least
confused
because
they
have
some
cases
going
one
way
and
some
cases
going
the
other
way.
and
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
the
government
can
be
relied
on
to
raise
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
suppose,
but
aren't
there
cases
where
the
government
would
really
like
to
get
the
substantive
issue
settled?
so
it
says,
well,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
arguable,
but
we'll
concede
that
the
action
was
timely.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
of
course,
bowles
--
i
mean
the
court
did
miss
something.
everyone
on
the
court
did,
and
that
is
that
the
period
to
file
your
notice
of
appeal
was
originally
not
in
any
statute.
it
was
in
the
rule,
the
frap
rule.
the
opinions,
both
sides,
assumed
that
the
statute
came
first,
and
the
rule
was
adopted
to
conform
to
the
statute,
but
in
fact
it
was
just
the
opposite.
it
was
a
rule,
a
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
which
can't
affect
jurisdiction.
we
know
that.
as
congress
says
rules
of
procedure
don't
affect
jurisdiction.
so
there
was
the
rule,
and
then
the
u.s.
judicial
conference
said
to
congress,
when
it
referred
the
rule
to
congress,
you
might
consider
a
conforming
amendment.
and
then
the
statute,
after
the
rule
came
into
effect,
conformed
to
the
rule.
so
what
the
court,
both
sides,
thought
in
bowles
--
we
just
had
it
in
reverse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
congress
didn't
think
about
it
at
all
until
the
u.s.
judicial
conference
said
do
this
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--
and
the
u.s.
judicial
conference
wasn't
thinking
that
thereby
it
became
jurisdictional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
addressed
specifically.
it
was
addressed
that
the
rule
--
that
the
--
that
all
of
this
was
statute
driven.
but
the
rule
before
--
before
there
was
a
conforming
statute,
you
would
say,
well,
then
it
wasn't
jurisdictional,
right?
