chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-1164,
john
r.
sand
&
gravel
company
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
haynes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
asking
us
to,
or
you
think
we
have
to,
to
rule
in
your
favor
overrule
our
decisions
in
kendall
and
soriano?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
irwin
involved
title
7
and
not
this
2501.
and
we
hadn't
addressed
title
7
before,
but
we
have
addressed
2501
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in,
in
the
more
recent
case
of
kontrick
--
i'm
looking
at
footnote
8
of
that
opinion
--
it
used
2401
as
an
example
of
the
jurisdictional
bar
and
2401
has
pretty
much
the
same
language
as
2501.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just,
just
to
get
all
the
cases
out
on
the
table,
our
more
recent
decision
in
bowles
suggested
that
there
may
be
a
difference
between
statutory
and
rule
limitations
and
also
suggested
that
the
prior
history
of
the
interpretation
of
a
provision
was
highly
relevant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
pretty
risky
business,
though,
to
rely
on
a
dissent
in
determining
whether
a
majority
overruled
the
prior
precedent
or
not,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
irwin.
i
thought
that
was
the
one
justice
ginsburg
posed
to
you
--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--
where
justice
white
in
dissent
said
that
irwin
overruled
soriano.
but
the
majority
certainly
didn't
say
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
hasn't
recodified
2501
in
the
past
17
years,
has
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
we
do
have
to
overrule
kendall
and
soriano?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
at
least
say
that
we
already
did
in
irwin?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
exactly
what
i
think
we
said
in
--
in
arbaugh;
and
that,
certainly,
going
forward
from
that
point
on,
congress
has
more
or
less
specified
that
it's
jurisdictional,
or
we're
not
going
to
read
it
that
way.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
was
the
rule
in
irwin
and
i'm
pretty
sure
it
wasn't
the
rule
in
soriano
and
kendall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know,
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
arguing
that
if
kendall
came
up
today,
it
would
be
decided
differently,
and
maybe
that's
right.
but
the
point
is
it
came
up
100
years
ago
and
it
was
decided,
and
the
question
is
whether
we
should
overturn
that
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
argument
is
more
strongly
supported
by
irwin
than
franconia.
franconia
simply
involved
an
accrual
rule,
which
doesn't
go
to
what
the
jurisdictional
effect
of
the
bar
on
commencing
a
case
is.
the
government
there
was
overreaching
and
arguing
for
a
special
accrual
rule,
and
the
court
said
no.
that's
different
than
saying
whether
the
actual
time
for
commencing
litigation
is
jurisdictional
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
like
saying
in
every
diversity
case,
theoretically,
the
court
has
to
scrutinize
whether
someone
who
alleges
they
are
a
citizen
of
pennsylvania
really
is.
and
that's
just
not
the
way
it
really
happens.
the
question
usually,
if
not
raised
by
the
party,
comes
up
under
some
other
situation,
such
as
in
this
case
the
amicus
raised
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
haynes.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
when
you're
beyond
the
seas
or
something?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
i
don't
--
it's
--
we've
found
it
difficult
enough
to
figure
out
which
statutes
are
jurisdictional
and
which
are
not.
and
now
you
want
us
to
say,
well,
even
if
it's
jurisdictional,
the
consequences
may
be
different
for
jurisdiction
and
for
equitable
tolling
and
for
waivibility.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
very
difficult
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
franconia
would
be
a
case
where
the
irwin
logic
not
only
would
but
did
apply.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
hard
to
understand
how
they
could
have
lost
the
case.
(laughter.)
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
haynes,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
haynes.
the
case
is
submitted.
(whereupon,
at
11:02
a.m.,
the
case
in
the
above-entitled
matter
was
submitted.)
