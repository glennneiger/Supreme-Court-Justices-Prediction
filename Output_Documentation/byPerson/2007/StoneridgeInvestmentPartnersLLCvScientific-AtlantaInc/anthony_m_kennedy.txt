the
transaction
was
not
wholly
without
benefit
to
scientific-atlanta.
they
got
some
advertising.
and
it
was
not
wholly
without
benefit
to
charter.
they
were
able
to
show
that
advertising
works.
now,
that
puts
aside
the
fact
that
they
were
using
misleading
accounting
principles.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
are...
there
are
any
number
of
kickbacks
and
mismanagement
and
petty
frauds
that
go
on
in
the
business,
and
business
people
know
that
any
publicly
held
company's
shares
are
going
to
be
affected
by
its
profits,
so
i
see
no
limitation
to
your...
to
your
proposal
for
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
agree
with
justice
scalia's
earlier
comment,
i
don't
think
that
scientific-atlanta
and
motorola
really
cared
anything
of...
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
investors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
them
the
scheme
made
a
certain
amount
of
sense,
they
didn't
really
care.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
far
different
from
having
a
purpose.
you
said
they
have
to
have
a
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
goes
back
to
my
earlier
question,
that
most
people
that
engage
in
frauds
on
business
know
that
if
it's
a
publicly
held
corporation,
it's
going
to
hurt
the
price
of
the
shares
or
affect
the
price
of
the
shares.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought...
i
agree
with
justice
ginsburg.
i
thought
the
"in-connection-with"
argument
is
actually
in
addition
to
or
separate
from
an
additional
argument
you
made
that
there
was
no
deceptive
statement
made
here.
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
arguing,
and
i
have
problems
with
that
argument
because
the
statute
doesn't
require
a
statement.
it
requires...
conduct
suffice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
say
that
there
was
deception,
standing
alone?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
not
the
allegation
of
the
complaint.
i...
i
thought
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
was
that
they...
they
knew
that
this
was
a
fraud
and
they
participated
in
the
fraud.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
mean
that...
so
that
your
answer
doesn't
seem
to
be...
get
us
very
far
on
a
legal
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
accept--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
we
accept
your
theory
of
the
case
and
we
then
get
another
case
in
which
an
accountant
or
an
attorney
who
prepares
the
statement
for
publication
to
the
investors
and
then
gives
it
to--
charter,
and
they
are
before
us,
could
we
find
liability
under
10b-5
as
to
the
accountants
and
still
rule...
and
still
keep
our
ruling
in
favor
of
your
client
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
so,
what
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
if
so,
what
would
be
the
rationale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
outside
accountants
and
attorneys
who
deliberately
and
directly
participate
in
negotiating...
or
in
drafting
the
false
disclosure
statements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
they
be
liable
and
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
but
your
client
not
liable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know,
mr.
shapiro,
if
in
the
law
of
torts
and
the
restatement
of
torts
or
in
other
areas
of
the
law
there
is
some
third
classification
that's
between
aider
and
abettor
in
principle?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
in
your
view
they
cannot
establish
the
"in
connection
with"
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
prior
to
the
statment,
there
is
no
reliance,
but
that
there
is
"in
connection
with"--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
--
in
the
realm
of
the
federal
securities
laws,
section
10(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
the
sec's
rule
that
enforces
that
statute,
rule
10b-5,
prohibit
deceptive
statements
in
connection
with
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities.
under
these
provisions,
the
sec
can
bring
enforcement
actions
against
violators,
and
this
court
has
also
held
that
the
statute
and
the
rule
contained
implied
authorization
for
a
private
cause
of
action
enforceable
in
the
federal
courts.
investors
--
investors
who
are
injured
by
reason
of
a
securities
violation
can
bring
an
action
to
recover
damages
in
certain
instances.
and
this
case
involves
the
reach
of
that
so-called
“implied
private
cause
of
action”.
it's
a
class
action
suit,
where
the
suit
comes
to
us
in
a
posture
where
we
assume
the
plaintiffs
investor's
allegation
is
to
be
true,
though
these
facts
have
not
yet
been
established
after
an
evidentiary
trial
or
--
or
a
hearing.
the
company
whose
shares
are
involved
is
called
charter
communications
inc.,
and
it's
a
cable
television
operator.
as
part
of
its
service,
it
provides
it's
customers
with
boxes
to
convert
digital
cable
signals
and
the
boxes
go
on
top
of
the
television
set,
and
in
the
trade
they're
called
“set-top
boxes”.
the
suit
alleges
that
late
in
the
year
2000,
charter's
executives
realized
that
the
company
would
fall
short
of
projected
operating
cash
flow.
and
so
they
decided
to
engage
in
some
deceptive
accounting
practices
to
make
charter's
cash
flow
look
better.
and
it's
alleged
that
as
part
of
their
plan,
charter
made
deceptive
contracts
with
two
of
its
suppliers.
those
suppliers
are
scientific-atlanta
and
motorola,
and
they're
the
respondents
here
and
those
two
respondents
supplied
charter
with
the
set-top
boxes.
it's
alleged
that
charter
arranged
to
overpay
respondents
$20
for
each
box
that
charter
purchased
until
the
end
of
the
year
with
the
understanding
that
he
respondents
would
return
the
overpayment
by
purchasing
advertising
from
charter.
the
respondents
agreed
to
the
arrangement
and
so
it's
alleged,
that
charter's
auditors
would
not
discover
the
link
between
the
overpayments
for
the
boxes
and
the
advertising
purchases.
respondent's
drafted
documents
to
make
the
transactions
appear
to
be
unrelated
and
conducted
it
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
charter
then,
in
violation
of
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,
recorded
the
advertising
payments
on
its
financial
statements
inflating
revenue
by
approximately
$17
million.
respondents
had
no
role
in
preparing
or
disseminating
the
financial
statements.
the
--
the
petitioner
is
the
lead
plaintiff
in
the
class
action,
representing
the
charter
investors
and
the
petitioner
filed
suit
against
these
respondent
companies.
it
contends
that
liability
is
appropriate
because
the
respondents
engaged
in
conduct
with
the
purpose
in
effect
of
creating
a
false
appearance
of
material
fact
to
a
further
scheme
to
--
to
misrepresent
charter's
revenue.
petitioner
says
that
financial
statement
charter
released
to
the
public
was
a
natural
and
expected
consequence
of
the
respondent's
deceptive
acts
and
that
respondent's
--
and
that
had
the
respondents
not
assisted
charter,
charter's
auditor
would
not
have
been
fooled
and
with
that
special
contracts
the
financial
statements
would
have
been
a
more
accurate
reflect
--
reflection
of
the
company
financial
condition.
we
reject
these
arguments.
were
the
petitioner's
theory
to
be
adopted,
the
implied
cause
of
action
would
reach
the
whole
marketplace
in
which
the
issuing
company
does
business
and
there's
no
authority
for
this
rule.
although
conduct
can
be
deceptive
for
the
purpose
of
section
10(b),
the
dispositive
issue
in
this
case
is
reliance.
we
conclude
respondent's
deceptive
acts
which
were
not
disclosed
to
the
investing
public,
are
too
remote
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
reliance.
it
was
charter
and
not
the
respondents
that
misled
its
auditor
and
filed
fraudulent
financial
statements.
and
nothing
the
respondents
did
made
it
necessary
or
--
or
inevitable
for
charter
to
record
the
transactions
in
the
way
it
did.
with
the
implied
cause
of
action
to
be
extended
to
the
practices
described
here,
there
would
be
a
risk
that
the
federal
power
would
be
used
to
invite
litigations
beyond
the
immediate
seer
of
securities
litigation
and
in
areas
already
covered
by
functioning
and
effective
state
law
guarantees.
our
precedence
counsel
against
this
extension,
section
10(b),
does
not
incorporate
common
law
fraud
in
the
federal
law.
this
conclusion
is
consistent
with
the
narrow
dimensions
we
must
give
to
a
right
of
action.
congress
did
not
authorize
when
it
first
enacted
the
statute
and
did
not
expand
when
it
revisited
the
law
recently
in
the
private
securities
litigation
reform
act
of
1995.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
souter
and
justice
ginsburg
have
joined.
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
