mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
erred
to
the
extent
it
held
that
section
10(b)
applies
only
to
verbal
misrepresentations
or
omissions.
but
the
court
correctly
held
that
this
court's
decision
in
central
bank
forecloses
petitioner's
claim
here.
like
the
plaintiff
in
central
bank,
petitioner
cannot
establish
reliance,
a
critical
element
of
the
section
10(b)
implied
right
of
action.
neither
petitioner
nor
the
market
relied
on
or
was
even
aware
of
any
deceptive
conduct
or
statement
by
respondents--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
question,
your
honor.
we
take
the
position
that
there
was
deceptive
conduct
alleged.
the...
one
of
the
elements
of
a
10b-5
violation,
but
not
the
only
element.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
as
i
say,
we
have
not
taken...
i
mean,
materiality,
for
instance,
the
"in
connection
with"
requirement,
scienter,
we
haven't
addressed
those
questions
and
have
not
taken
a
position.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
haven't
taken
a
position,
and--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor.
we
haven't
addressed
the
other
elements
and
those...
questions
that
we
have...
because
there
is
no
need
to
resolve
them
in
this
case
and
because
they
weren't
resolved
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
by
the
district
court,
we
have
chosen
to
focus
on
what
we
think
is
dispositive
and
what
was
raised
and
decided
below,
which
is
reliance.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
certainly
individual
commissioners
have
given
speeches
and
testified
before
congress
to
the
effect
that
the
commission
voted
in
this
case
to
agree
with
our
position
on
deception,
the
position
that's
expressed
in
our
brief,
and
by
a
three-to-two
vote
to
disagree
with
the
position
on
reliance
that
is
expressed
in
our
brief.
but
i
don't
know
that
there
has
been
any
official
sec
commission--
statement
to
that
effect
that's
been
publicly
released.
as
i
said,
the
only
deceptive
conduct
that
was
allegedly
committed
by
respondents
in
this
case
involves
the
backdating
of
contracts
and
the
false
justifications
for
the
price
increase.
that
conduct
was
never
disclosed
to
the
market
at
any
time
during
the
class
period,
and
therefore,
could
not
have
been
relied
on
by
the
market
or
by
petitioners.
and
as
a
consequence,
under
this
court's
decisions
in
central
bank
and
in
basic,
reliance
cannot
be
established
because
the
presumption
of
reliance
that
petitioner
seeks
to
invoke
requires
as
a
prerequisite
to
its
invocation
the
existence
of
a
publicly
disseminated
statement
from
the
defendant
that
was
disseminated
to,
and
therefore,
relied
on
by
the
market.
that
did
not
happen
here
with
respect
to
respondents.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
sec
is
entitled
to
obtain
civil
fines,
as
well
as
disgorgement
remedies.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
don't
know...
i
believe
in
the,
not
in
this
case
but
in
the
adelphia
case,
which
is
addressed--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--if
i
may...
yes,
yes
and
no,
i
think
is
the
answer
to
that
question;
because
under
the
fair
funds
provision
of
the
sarbanes-oxley
act,
section
308
of
sarbanes-oxley,
the
sec
is
authorized
to
take
fines
and
distribute
those...
add
those
to
disgorgement
relief...
and
distribute
them
to
investors.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
agree
with
that
point.
in
the
adelphia
matter--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
they
obtained...
at
least--
it
appears
that
they
obtained
advertising
that
presumably
had
some
value,
although
it
didn't
cost
them
anything;
and
presumably
the
sec
could
seek
the
value
of
that
advertising.
as
i
said,
in
the
adelphia
matter
where
the
sec
did
pursue
the
vendors
that
assisted
adelphia
in
a
somewhat
similar
transaction,
it
obtained
substantial
monetary
recoveries
from
them.
i--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
believe
the
allegations
were
similar
to
those
presented
here.
but
in
any
event,
certainly
the
sec
has
the
authority
to
proceed
in
that
fashion,
and
additionally
the
justice
department
has
the
ability
to
proceed
criminally
and
obtain
substantial
monetary
sanctions,
either
as
part
of
a
deferred
prosecution
agreement,
as
part
of
a
restitutionary
sanction
and
the
like;
but
the
fundamental
point
is
that
for
the
private
right
of
action
to
apply,
as
this
court
said
in
central
bank,
all
of
the
elements
of
the
private
cause
of
action
must
be
satisfied
with
respect
to
the
individual
defendant.
that
is
the
line.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
occupies
the
field
per
se,
but
what
it
does
do
is...
given
the
timing
of
this
court's
decision
in
central
bank
in
1994,
followed
by
congress's
considering
the
question
whether
to
provide
for
secondary
liability
in
private
actions,
and
its
decision
not
to
authorize
such
secondary
liability...
what
it
does
clearly
suggest
is
that
this
court
ought
not
adopt
the
expansive
view
of
the
implied
right
of
action
that
petitioner
is
urging,
but
instead
both
because
the
court
is
appropriately
cautious
in
expanding
liability
under
implied
rights
of
action,
and
because
congress
has
now
looked
at
this
question,
not
once
but
twice,
and
has
declined
to
provide
secondary
liability
for
secondary
actors
under
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
you
can...
it's
possible
for
someone
to
be
both
but
in
order
to
be
both
they
must
have...
they
must
have
satisfied
all
of
the
elements.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
for
instance
an
auditor
who
certifies
false
financial
statements
and
allows--
that...
its
certification
to
be,
to
be
publicly
disseminated,
thereby
aiding
and
assisting
in
the
issuer's
primary
fraud,
but
is
also
a...
quite
likely
to
be
a
primary
violator,
because
they
have
spoken
to
the
market.
the
market
is
relying
on
their
statements,
and
is
aware
that
they
are
making
them;
and
so
they
would
be
both
a
primary
violator,
but
could
presumably
be
pursued
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
preclusion
of
liability
under
both,
but
in
order
to
be
in
that
category
you
must
be
a
primary
violator.
and
here,
petitioners
have
not
established
and
cannot
establish
the
reliance
element
with
respect
to
respondents,
because
nothing
that
respondents
said
or
did
was
disseminated
to
the
market
during
the
class
period.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
have
not
taken
a
position--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
i
would
hesitate
to
say
that,
your
honor,
because
the
sec
and
the
united
states
do
not
have
to
establish
reliance
in
criminal
or--
civil
enforcement
proceedings,
but
we
do
have
to
establish
"in
connection
with",
and
we
think
they
are
different.
we
think
reliance
adds
something
more
than
what
"in
connection
with"
requires,
and
so
i
certainly
would
urge
the
court
not
to
suggest
that
merely
because
reliance
is
not
established,
therefore
"in
connection
with"
must
not
also
be
established;
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
the
"in
connection
with"
question
is
best
resolved,
not
in
this
case,
but
in
the
case
where
it's
been
squarely
presented,
and
preferably
a
government
enforcement
action
where
the
government
has
an
opportunity
to
tailor
the
case
in
an
appropriate
fashion.
the
court,
as
i
said
has
been--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
think
it
was,
your
honor.
it
was
certainly
briefed
and
argued
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
squarely
resolved
it
at
page
41a
of
the
petition
appendix.
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
reliance
at
page
10a
of
the
petition
appendix.
it
did
not
give
it
a--
fully
orbed
discussion.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
on
page
10a,
they
also
talk
about
reliance,
your
honor;
and
what's
important
here
to
understand
is
that
petitioner's
theory
of
reliance
rests
on
a
misstatement,
because
they
say
the
market...
it's
a
basic
presumption
of
reliance
based
on
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory
case.
that's
the
only
allegation
of
reliance
in
the
complaint;
that
requires
something
publicly
disseminated.
the
only
thing
that
was
publicly
disseminated
is
the
statement.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is,
that
doesn't
work,
there
was
no
reliance
because
respondents
didn't
make
any
publicly
disseminated
statement.
so
it's
actually,
perhaps
not
a
complete,
but
certainly
a
perfectly
reasonable
resolution
of
the
reliance
question;
and
therefore
it
is
squarely
presented.
petitioners
raised
reliance
in
their
petition--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--at
page
25.
in
their
opening
brief
at
pages
37
to
40,
it's
squarely
presented
and--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
on
page
10a,
the
second
line,
the
first
full
sentence,
speaking
of
motorola
and
scientific-atlanta,
"they
did
not
issue
any
misstatement
relied
upon
by
the
investing
public.
"
and
then
it
goes
on
the
next
sentence:
"none
of
the
alleged
financial
misrepresentations
by
charter
was
made
by
or
even
with
the
approval
of
the
vendors.
"
that
is
the
respondents.
again
as
i
say,
it's
not
as
complete
a
discussion
of
the
reliance
issue
as
we
would
have
thought
appropriate
if
we
had
been
writing
the
opinion,
but
it
certainly
does
touch
on
the
question
and
we
think
it's
wholly
presented.
