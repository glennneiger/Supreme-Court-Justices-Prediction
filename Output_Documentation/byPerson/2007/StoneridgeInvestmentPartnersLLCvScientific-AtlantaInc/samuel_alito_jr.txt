justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
your
theory
dependent
on
the
proposition
that
scientific-atlanta
and
motorola
deceived
arthur
andersen?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
didn't
you
allege
exactly
the
opposite
in
your
complaint?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i'm
looking
at
paragraph
218
of
your
amended
complaint,
109a
of
the
joint
appendix,
subsection
4.
it
says,
speaking
of--
arthur
andersen,
"though
aware
that
charter
was
seeking
to
boost
its
revenues
by
paying
vendors
higher
prices
at
the
same
time
it
received
additional
advertising
from
the
same
vendors,
andersen
failed
to
properly
audit
these
transactions
by
confirming
them
with
the
vendors.
"
so
you
alleged
that
they
weren't
deceived.
you
alleged
that
they
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right,
just...
just
to
be
clear
on
this...
if
charter
and
arthur
andersen
and
scientific-atlanta
and
motorola
all
sat
down
and
cooked
up
this
scheme
together
and
they
all
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on,
would
you
have
a
claim
against
the
respondents
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
i
see
absolutely
no
difference
between
your
test
and
the
elements
of
aiding
and
abetting.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
because
you
just
said
that
it's
not
necessary
for
there
to
be
an
actual
deceptive
act
on
the
part
of
the
respondents.
