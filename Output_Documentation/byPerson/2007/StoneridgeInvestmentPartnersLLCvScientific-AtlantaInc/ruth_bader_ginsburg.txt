and
was
the
price
four
to
five
times
higher
than
the
normal
rates
for
advertising?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
told...
who
told
charter
that
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
have
a
time
spread
between
the
contract...
the
$20
above
the
contract
price
and
the
advertising
payment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
it
told
them
that,
didn't
it
have...
it
sounds
to
me
from
that
that
the
accountant
says,
look,
if
you
want
to
make
this
appear
on
the
balance
sheet
as
though
the
advertising
revenues
were
just
ordinary
advertising
revenues,
you
better
separate
these
two.
that
suggests
that
arthur--
andersen
knew
all
along
what
was
going
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
grossman,
before
you
finish,
there
is
one
statement
made
by
the
other
side
that
you
are
trying
to
use
this...
small
in
comparison
to
all
the
fraud
that
was
involved
here
in
order
to
collect
on
the
entire
loss.
that
is,
you
are
asserting--
that
the
vendors
are
liable
for
the
entire
loss
when
they
were
just
a
bit
player.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
are
you
seeking?
how
would
you
measure
your
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
if
you
equate
this
with
aiding-and-abetting,
and
i
think
the
question
is
is
there
a
middle
category
between
charter,
who
is
clearly
primarily
liable,
and
central
bank,
that
didn't
do
anything
deceptive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
saying...
i
thought
your
argument,
unlike
the
government's
argument,
is
that
there
was
no
deceptive
device.
there
was
no
deceptive
device.
they
simply
aided
and
abetted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
charter
said...
vendors,
i
need
you
to
consummate
this
fraud
on
the
public.
i
can't
do
it
without
you.
i've
got
to
have
those
revenues
that
you're
going
to
give
me
through
these
phony
advertising
payments
at
four
or
five
times
the
usual
rate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
must
assume
that
they
are
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
if
they
are...
that's
if
they
are
aiders
and
if
there
are
only
two--
categories
and
everyone
who
is
not
charter
is
an
aider
and
abettor,
then
you're
right.
but
if
there's
a
middle
category
of
people
who,
while
not
the
benefited
company...
the
company
that's
trying
to
achieve
the
deception...
but
made
it
possible
for
that...
for
that
deception
to
happen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
central
bank,
it
was
conceded
that
the
bank
engaged
in
no
deceptive
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
there
is
the
charge
that
it
did
engage
in
deceptive
acts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
whole
purpose
of
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
shapiro,
if--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
it
was
communicated
to
investors
that
there
had
been
$20
per
set
box
over
the
regular
price,
if
there
had
been
advertising
that
was
paid
for
by
the
very
money
that
charter
gave,
then
the
whole
thing
would
have
failed.
so
this
can
work
only
if
the
vendors
are
silent.
silence
and
not
speech
is
what
counts.
if
the
vendors
communicate
anything
at
all,
the
whole
thing
fails.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
there
any
economic
substance
to
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
true
that
the
price
that
they
were
charging,
they
did
not
charge
to
other
customers...
the
$20
hike?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
sham
then,
because
they
said
the
reason
they
upped
the
price
$20
a
box
was--
they...
the
inflationary
conditions,
so
they
had
to
renegotiate
the
contract,
but
didn't
renegotiate
with
any
of
their
other
customers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
essence
of
the
scheme.
you
said
that
they...
they
are
home
free
because
they
didn't
themselves
make
any
statement
to
investors.
but
they
set
up
charter
to
make
those
statements,
to
swell
its
revenues...
revenues
that
it
in
fact
didn't
have.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
if
they
are
aiders
and
abettors,
which
is
what
congress
covered.
and
i--
again
go
back
to,
is
there
another
category
or
is
everyone...
either
charter,
the
person
whose
stock
is
at
stake,
the
company
whose
stock
is
at
stake
and
everyone
else
is
an
aider?
i
take
it
that
that's
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
either
the
company
whose
stock
is
in
question
or
you're
an
aider
and
abettor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
i
thought
speak
about
aiders
and
abettors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
usually--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--aider
and
abettor...
then
again
we
get
back
to
the
question:
if
there's
nothing
in
this
world
other
than
the
company
that
puts
out
the
false
statement
and
the
aider
and
abettor--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
is
there
something
in
between?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
taking
those
out.
we're
talking
about
independent
actors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
sec
distinguish
this
kind
of
situation
where
silence
is
the
essence
of
the
thing
for
the
deceiver,
silence
not
speech?
does
the
sec
distinguish
this
from
aiding-and-abetting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
sec
get
any
monetary
recovery
for
the
investors
on
your
theory?
you
say
yes,
it's
a
deceptive
practice,
but
this
belongs
in
the
sec's
bailiwick,
not
in
private
suits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
private
suits;
obviously
they
are
seeking
damages
for
the
decline
in
the
share
price.
what
could
the
sec...
suppose
it
should
take
up
this
case...
get
by
way
of
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
no
disgorgement
here
because
the
vendors
didn't
get
anything.
for
them
it
was
a
wash.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but
this
case,
disgorgement
would
not
be
a
remedy.
you
say
fines,
but
those
would
be
payable
to
the
government,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
would
be
no
disgorgement
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
profits
did
the
vendors
get?
for
them
it
was
a
wash.
they
got...
what
did
they
have
to
disgorge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did
they
receive
something
that
they
then
disgorged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
looking
at
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
i
thought
just
said
that
there
was
no
deceptive
device.
