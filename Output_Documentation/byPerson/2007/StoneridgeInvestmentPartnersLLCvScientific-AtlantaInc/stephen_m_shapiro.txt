mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
friend
has
just
asked
the
court
to
expand
an
implied
cause
of
action
by
diluting
traditional
requirements
such
as
the
reliance
requirement
and
by
eroding
this
court's
precedent
in
the
central
bank
case.
the
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
it
must
be
very
cautious
about
expanding
implied
causes
of
action,
but
here
there
are
special
reasons
for
caution.
expanding
the
implied
cause
of
action
would
give
plaintiff
the
very
thing
that
congress
said
it
should
not
get
in
section
20(e)
of
the
exchange
act.
congress
wanted
cases
like
this
one
to
be
handled
by
an
expert
and
disinterested
administrative
agency.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
central
bank
case,
i
believe,
answers
that
by
saying
to
be
a
primary
violator
you
have
to
satisfy
all
the
prerequisites
of
10(b)
liability,
including
reliance,
loss
causation,
the
"in-connection-with"
standard.
and
here
plaintiffs
fail
to
meet
these
tests.
and
congress
in
20(e)--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
that's
one
of
the
arguments
we
make.
it
is
this
case
is
governed
by
central
bank
because
the
defendant
did
not
use
or
employ
deception
in
connection
with
a
securities
transaction.
that
exactly
describes
what
charter
did.
now,
what
exactly
describes
what
the
vendors
are
alleged
to
do
is
what
is
said
in
20(e)...
to--
knowingly
give
substantial
assistance
to
someone
else
that
is
misleading
an
investor.
that
fits
this
case
like
a
glove--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
don't
make
these
arguments
without
reference
to
each
other.
we
think
all
of
these
statutory
terms
have
to
be
viewed
together.
you
have
to
use
deception
in
connection
with
securities
trading,
which
these
vendors
did
not
do.
that's
what
charter
did.
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
we
have...
we
have
suggested
that
that
is
not
true
when
you're
speaking
with
somebody
that
knows
the
facts
such
as
charter.
charter
understood
all
these
facts.
charter
could
have--
accounted
for
these
transactions
correctly,
itself.
the
vendors
did
that.
they
didn't
recognize
any
revenues
here.
it
was
up
to
charter
to
account
for
these
transactions
properly.
congress
required
it
to
do
that,
so
it
is
the
speaker
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
believe
even
placing
that
most
pejorative
characterization
on
these
facts,
which
we
don't
agree
are
the
true
facts,
that
still--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--assuming
that
they
are,
that
this
is
a
20(e)
situation
where
it
is
alleged
that
the
vendors
gave
substantial,
knowing
assistance
to
somebody
who
was
committing
a
fraud.
and
congress
said
that
an
expert
and
disinterested
administrative
agency
should
decide
whether
to
proceed,
because
it
is
so
slippery
to
apply
these
characterizations.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
you
know
that's
an
exact
description
of
central
bank
because
there
it
was
alleged
that
the
trustee
entered--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--into
a
secret
agreement.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--what
was
conceded
was
that
the
bank
made
no
statement
to
investors,
but
what
was
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
argued
in
the
briefs
was
that
the
bank
entered
into
a
secret
side
agreement
that
enabled
the
use
of
a
fraudulent
prospectus
that
unleashed
securities
that
were
worthless
on
investors,
and
investors
said,
we
were
depending
on
our
trustee
to
prevent
that
from
happening.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we...
we
think
that
for
reliance
purposes,
there--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
defendant
has
to
communicate
with
investors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
has
to
be
communicated
to
the
investors
and
it
has
to
be
attributed
under
the
case
law
to
the
speaker.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that...
that
kind
of
but-for
causation
is
not
sufficient.
that
is
not
reliance.
that
kind
of--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
one
of
our
submissions,
but
we
also
say
that
the
substance
of
these
statements
was
never
communicated
to
investors.
only
charter--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--spoke
to
the
investors
and
never
summarized
these.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
the...
the
communication,
your
honor,
has
to
be
to
the
market
and
to
investors.
there
was
no
duty
to
disclose
to
investors
here.
the
only
communications
the
vendors
made
were
"we're
raising
our
prices
6
percent,
the
date
of
our
contract
is
august
31st,
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
started
the
very
next
day....
"
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--1st>
["].
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
of
course.
there
was
economic
substance
from
the
vendors'
perspective.
they
were
selling
their
products
at
exactly
the
price
that
they
wanted
to
receive
for
those
products
and
they
were
getting
some
free
cooperative
advertising
thrown
in
at
the
same
time.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
it's
true
because
they
weren't
concerned
with
that
because
they
weren't
paying
for
it.
charter
was
paying
for
this
cooperative...
cooperative
advertising,
the
reason
being--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
charter
had
a
big
interest.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
from
the
vendors'
perspective,
this
was
a
transaction
that
appeared
to
be
a
way
to
increase
cooperative
advertising.
it
cost
the
vendors
no
money.
they
were
told
by
charter
that
arthur
andersen
had
approved
the
transaction.
that's
alleged
in
the
barford
indictment.
then
they
went
home
and
talked
to
their
own
auditors...
how
do
you
account
for
this
unusual
transaction?
the
auditors
said,
you
cannot
record
any
revenues
from
the
transaction.
they
didn't
record
any
revenues.
they
expected
charter
to
do
the
same
thing,
to
not
record
revenues--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--if
that's
what
the
rules
required.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
they...
they
do
allege.
i'm
merely
pointing
out
that
in
the
barford--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
we
say
that
if
you
take
the
complaint
at
face
value
and
you
don't
even
consider
the
barford
indictment
that
they
cite,
that
it
still
is
a
classic
example
of
knowingly
giving
substantial
assistance
to
someone
else
that
is
making
misstatements
to
investors,
because
these
vendors
didn't
make
any
misstatement
to
investors.
nobody
relied
on
their
sales
correspondence.
it
sat
in
a
file
drawer
until
long
after
the
stock
had
gone
all
the
way
up
and
come
all
the
way
down.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
congress's
policy
judgment
here
is
that
the
sec,
an
expert
agency
that
is
impartial,
should
evaluate
a
claim
of
that
sort
and
decide
whether
to
proceed.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--you
are
only
a
primary
violator
under...
under
central
bank
if
each
and
every
element
of
10b-5
liability
is
satisfied,
including
reliance
on
your
statement,
including
the
"in-connection-with"
test,
and
including
loss
causation.
none
of
those
tests
are
satisfied
here,
but
what
is
satisfied
is
section
20(e),
which
says,
did
they
knowingly
give
substantial
assistance
to
somebody
who
is
committing
a
fraud?
and
that...
that
fits
this
case
like
a
glove--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--if
congress
wanted
the
sec
to
address--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
really
depends
on--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--on
the
circumstances.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
some
attorneys
are
control
persons
within
corporations,
and
in-house
counsel
that
drafts
the
disclosure
statement
which
contains
a
falsehood
may
be
liable
as
in
the
mcconville
case,
which
the
court
recently
considered.
individuals
may
be
liable--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it...
it's
possible.
your
honor,
at
the
end
of
your--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--absolutely--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes,
sir.
the
reason--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
reason
is
they
issued
opinions
that
were
circulated
to
investors,
that
were
attributed
to
them
and
which
were
authorized
by
them,
and
if
a
lawyer
does
the
same
thing,
if
steve
shapiro
writes
an
opinion
letter
and
circulates
it
to
investors
and
it's
full
of
falsehoods--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
can
be
held
liable
for
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--as
a
speaker.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
only
people
who
speak
to
the
market--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
induce
investor
reliance.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
just
aiding
and
abetting,
and
in
fact
congress
dealt
with
that
squarely
in
section
303--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--oh,
yes--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
not
sufficient.
congress
addressed
that
in
section
303
of
sarbanes-oxley,
and
it
held
that
any
person...
said
any
person
including
a
vendor
that
misleads
an
auditor
can
be
held
liable
in
an
sec
proceeding
only,
not
in
a
private
suit.
it
excluded
private
actions.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
pardon
me?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
word
"exclusively"
is
in
there--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
my--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
rely
on
20(e)
and
303
of--
sarbanes-oxley,
and
my
friend
has
made
the
argument--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
talking
about
an
aider
and
abettor
that
misleads
an
auditor
and
then--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
auditor
issues
a
false
certification.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well...
oh,
no--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--your
honor,
there
are
other
persons
that
are
control
persons
within
a
company
who
are
liable.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
independent
actors
that
don't
speak
to
the
markets
and
cause
direct
reliance
on
their
own
statements
are
aiders
and
abettors.
and
they
are
supposed
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
sec,
an
expert
agency.
now,
my...
you
know,
my
friend
made
the--
argument
about
sarbanes-oxley
that
there's
a
savings
clause
in
that
provision
that
preserves
other
remedies.
but
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it
says
explicitly
we
are
preserving
sec
remedies.
we
want
the
sec
to
pursue
these
suits.
and
congress
refused
in
2002
in
sarbanes-oxley
to
reinstate
the
aiding-and-abetting
private
liability
cause
of
action.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
don't
know
the
answer.
although
in
these
statutes
themselves
there
are
such
provisions
not
included
in
section
10(b).
for
example
in
section
18(a),
if
you
cause
some
other
person
to
make
a
false
statement
in
a
financial
statement,
you
can
be
held
liable,
but
they
are
not
invoking
it
in
section
18.
same
thing
under
section
17.
if
you
engage
in
a
scheme
to
cause
some
falsehood,
you
can
be
prosecuted
by
the
government.
but
nowhere
has
congress
said
that
an
individual
litigant
can
bring
a
claim
like
that
without
regard
for
reliance
and
"in
connection
with"
and
the
loss
causation
test.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no,
i
don't
think
there
can
be.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
because
congress
intended
in
section
20(e)
to
have
an
expert
agency
address
these
cases
and
not
to
have
the
trial--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
believe
they
are
separate
categories
and
that
central
bank
tells
us
exactly
who
the
primary
violator
is.
he
is
somebody
who
makes
a
statement
that
investors
rely
on
in
connection
with
securities
transactions,
and
that
is
not
these
vendors.
that
is
exactly
what
section
20(e)
addresses
and
commits--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--absolutely.
absolutely.
we
don't
quarrel
over
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
it's
primary
because
there
is
the
communication
to
the
market
that's
missing
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
can
call
it...
both
of
those
things.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
can't
have
primary
liability,
which
they
are
asserting
here,
without
the
statement
to
the
market.
and
it
can
be
a
statement
by
conduct,
and
it
can
be
by
nodding
of
the
head.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes.
nodding
the
head
is
the
same
thing
as
saying
yes.
but
it
has
to
be
made
directly
to
an
investor
and
cause
reliance
by
that
investor.
that's
what's
missing
here.
so
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
eighth
circuit's
decision.
it
didn't
address
that
refinement,
because
it
has
no
bearing
on
this
case.
so
there
is
no
point
in
reversing
the
decision.
it
has
to
be
affirmed
in
our
view
for
want
of
reliance,
for
want
of
loss
causation,
for
lack
of
"in
connection
with",
and
because
most
importantly,
congress
intended
to
remove
this
category
of
case
and
commit
it
to
an
expert
agency
as
part
of
its
very
important
reform
effort
to
deal
with
excessive
litigation
that
was
harming
our
economy.
this
was
an
important
concept
for
congress.
and
it
said
it
twice:
first
in
the
pslra
in
1995,
then
in
2002,
in
the
sarbanes-oxley
law.
and
it
removed
even
claims
that
you
mislead
an
auditor
under
section
303
of
sarbanes-oxley.
and
there
is
no
savings
clause
there
for
private
actions.
congress
refused
to
permit
the
private
actions.
instead,
it
permitted
the
sec
to
bring
intentional
misconduct
cases
under
section
20(e)
or
negligent
misconduct
cases
under
section
303
or
under
section
13.
and
the
sec
has
a
broad
panoply
of
remedies.
it
doesn't
have
to
just
allege
intentional--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
the
sec's
view
is
the
one
rejected
by
the
solicitor
general,
and
that's
this
purpose-and-effect
standard
that's
been
advocated,
which
we
think
is
hopelessly
vague.
and
it
overrides
the
reliance
requirement.
it
overrides
the
"in
connection
with"
requirement.
and
it
overrides
loss
causation,
not
to
mention
central
bank.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
central
bank
itself.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
because
the
court
there
said
that
even
though
the
bank
did
something
that
was
a
secret
agreement
that
facilitated
the
issuer's
distribution
of
a
false
prospectus
and
caused
all
the
harm
to
the
shareholders,
it
was
a
direct
sine
qua
non
cause
of
all
of
that
harm,
that
that
was
merely
aiding
and
abetting,
because
there
was
no
reliance
on
anything
that
the
bank
stated
or
anything
that
the
bank
had
a
duty
to
state
because
of
a
fiduciary
relationship.
now,
the
vendors
here
are
even
far
more
removed
from
investors
than
the
bank
was
in
central
bank.
the
investors
knew
about
the
bank
in
central
bank,
and
they
were
relying
on
it
to
do
its
job.
but
that
was
not
sufficient
because
it
made
no
statement
that
the
investors
relied
on.
there
is
no
communication
here
between
these
vendors
and
investors.
there
is
no
way
you
could--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
the
private
cause
of
action.
an
important
point,
justice
stevens,
because
the
sec
is
not
burdened
with
any
of
these
elusive--
inquiries
into
but-for
causation,
speculative
questions
of
indirect
reliance;
none
of
that
burdens
the
sec.
and
the
sec
also
has
power
to
distribute
funds
to
investors.
this
is
the
better
mousetrap
that
congress
prescribed
for
these
kinds
of
cases.
it
didn't
want
the
trial
lawyers
to
bring
class
actions
that
always
result
in
settlements.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
thank
the
court.
