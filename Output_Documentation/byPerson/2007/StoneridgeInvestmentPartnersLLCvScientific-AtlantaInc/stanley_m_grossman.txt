mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text
of
section
10(b)
as
well
as
the
rule
10b-5
promulgated
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
prohibit
the
use
of
any
deceptive
device
by
any
person,
indirectly
or
indirectly,
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
the
various
deceptive
devices
used
by
the
respondents
in
this
case
is
conduct
that
is
squarely
covered
by
the
text
of
the
statute
and
by
the
rule.
respondents
here
were
not
passive
bystanders
facilitating
a
fraud
by
charter.
their
deceptive
conduct
was
integral
to
the
scheme
to
create
fictitious
advertising
revenues
for
charter
to
report
to
investors.
respondents
agreed
to
overcharge
charter
so
that
they
could
receive
the
money
from
charter
to
then
return
to
it
for
the
advertising,
using
charter's
very--
same
money
for
the
purchase
of
the
advertising.
respondent
scientific-atlanta
created
a
document
falsely
claiming
that
the
reason
for
the
increased
payments
from
charter
were
because
of
increased
manufacturing
expenses.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
well,
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
that
they
received
free
advertising.
but
the
problem
was
that
they
were
creating
the
illusion
that
it
wasn't
free
advertising,
but
rather
that
they
were
purchasing
the
advertising.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
the
obvious
purpose
for
creating
the
illusion
that
they
were
purchasing
the
advertising
rather
than
receiving
free
advertising
was
so
that
charter
can
incorporate
these
increased
revenues
in
their
financial
statements.
and
respondents
understood,--
they
understood
that
in
order
to...
for
charter
to
pass
this
by
their
accountants,
to
deceive
the
accountants...
and
this
is
reflected
in
the
indictment...
in
order
to
deceive
the
accountants
for
charter,
the
respondents
were
told
that
there
had
to
be
separate
agreements
for
both
the
advertising
agreements
and
the
purchase
agreements.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
well,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
at
this
point
in
time...
i
think
as
the
court
recognized
in
dura
fairly
recently...
that
when
congress
enacted
the
private
security
law
reform
act,
that
at
that
time
they
accepted--
the
private
right
of
action
that
this
court
had
previously
inferred.
and
this
court
had
previously
inferred
the
private
right
of
action
not
only
for
the
section
but
each
of
the
rules
in
section
10(b).
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
well,
this
court,
your
honor,
as
recently
as
2002
in
wharf
(holdings)
said
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
for
violation
of
any
of
the
subdivisions
of
rule
10b-5:
a,
b,
or
c.
that
would
have
to
be
reversed.
going
back
to
the
superintendent
of
insurance
case
in,
in...
that
would
be
in
1971,
your--
honor,
the
court
held
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
for
violation
of--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--but
when
congress
enacted
the
private
security
law
reform
act,
everything
it
did
in
connection
with
that
statute
was
directed
to
the
private
right
of
action
that
this
court
had
previously
implied
under
10(b).
nothing
that
congress
did
was
intended
in
any
way--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--well,
i
would
agree,
congress
has
taken
it
over.
and
when
they
enacted
the
private
security
law
reform
act,
they
recognized
this
private
right
of
action.
everything
they
did
recognized
the
private
right
of
action.
it
recognized
that
there
would
be
multiple
primary
violators
of
10(b).
it
did
that
in
connection
with
proportionate
liability--
provisions.
it
recognized
that
there
would
be
multiple
players.
so
certainly,
congress
had
an
understanding
of
what
this
court
had
done
up
until
that
time.
and
this
court
up
until
that
time
had
implied
the
private
right
of
action
for
every
subset
of
rule
10b-5.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
no.
no,
not
under
the
test
that
we
have
proposed,
which
is
very
similar
to
the
test
proposed
by
the
ninth
circuit
or
applied
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
simpson
case,
and
the
test
proposed
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
their
amicus
brief
submitted
in
the
simpson
case.
it's
not
enough
to
just
to
have
the
deceptive
act.
the
deceptive
act
for
scheme
liability
has
to
be
with
the
purpose
of--
furthering
a
scheme
to
defraud
investors.
so
if
scientific-atlanta
or
motorola
had
engaged
in
deceptive
conduct,
but
that
deceptive
conduct
was
not
intended
to
further
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
shareholders,
no,
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
action
under
the
theory
that
we
are
pursuing
here.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
oh,
it
would
be
enough
if
they
committed
a
deceptive
act
and
they
knew
it
was
in
furtherance
of
a
scheme.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
i
think
that
would
be
reckless.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
yes,
but
my
position
is
also--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--it
certainly
needs
scienter.
you
certainly
need
scienter.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
exactly
right,
justice
souter.
and
i
think
it's
important...
and
there
is
a
very...
there
is
a
very
good
discussion
of
this
in
the
simpson
case
by
the
ninth
circuit,
that
the
purpose
of
the
test
is
such
that
it
will
not
ensnare
someone
who
does
engage
in
a
deceptive
act
but
doesn't
understand
that
the
reason
for
it
is
to
further
a
scheme.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
no.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
this
court
answered
this
last
term
in
the
tellabs
case.
and
congress
answered
that
question
that
you
pose
in
the
pslra,
the
private
security
law
reform
act,
so--
that
you
cannot
just
bring
a
case
and
hope
to
get
it
by
the
summary-judgment
stage.
you
have
to
have
particularized
facts
alleged
under
the
heightened
pleading
standards
of
the
pslra
and
this
court's
decision
in
tellabs
showing
that
not
only
the
deceptive
act,
but
that
the
purpose
of
that
deceptive
act
was
to
further
a
scheme.
so,
no,
you
can't
just--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--well,
of
course
if
you
just...
if
you
just
allege
it
on
information
and
belief,
you're
out
of
court.
no
doubt
about
that.
that
doesn't
pass
the
heightened
pleading
standard
in
tellabs
or
the
pslra.
what
you
do
need
is
what
we
have
here.
here
you
have
allegations...
and
we
didn't
make
these
allegations
from
whole
cloth...
these
allegations
were
derived
principally
from
a
grand
jury...
the
federal
grand
jury
indictment
against
charter
executives.
that
indictment
says
that
respondents
were
informed
and
ordered
to
deceive
charter's
accountants.
they
had
to
have--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--well,
i
think
if
congress
intended
under
20(e)...
certainly
the
private
actions
similar
to
this...
it
would
have
said
that
only
the
sec
has
the
authority
to
bring
a
claim
for
substantial
assistance
whether
or
not
it
involves
deceptive
conduct.
they
could
have
very
easily
said
"any
deceptive
conduct",
and
that
would
have
barred
these
claims.
they
chose
not
to
do
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
secondary
actors.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
we
are
not
asking
any
extension.
quite
the
contrary,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
the
respondents
who
are
asking
for
a
narrowing.
when
congress
addressed
the
pslra
it
addressed
all
of
the
arguments
that
we
are
hearing
today
from
respondents
and
their
amici.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
that
certainly
is
a
large
part
of
it.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
no.
we...
i
think
what
you're
referring
to
is
that...
is
that
the
accountants
should
have
conducted
a
more
diligent
audit
than
they
did.
i
mean
these
people
clearly
were
trying
to
deceive
the
auditors.
why
else
would
you
issue
a
document
falsely
stating
a
reason
for
a
price
increase?
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
no...
no,
your
honor,
they
knew
that
they
were
paying
the
vendors
higher
prices,
but
they
didn't
know
why.
the
contract...
the
contract
for
the
higher
prices
was
followed
by
this
misstatement
saying
the
reason
for
the
higher
prices
is
because
of
increased
manufacturing
expenses,
when
in
fact
that
wasn't
the
reason.
the
reason
was
to
take
money--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--arthur
andersen.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
no.
justice
ginsburg,
what
arthur
andersen
did
not
know...
and
this
is
very
clear.
they
did
not
know
that
it
was
charter's
own
money
that
was
being
used
by
the
respondents
to
purchase
the
advertising.
they
were
deceived
by
that
document
that
said,
we
are
increasing
the
price
on
the
set-top
boxes
because
of
increased
manufacturing
expense.
that
was
false.
the
reason
they
were
increasing
it
is
because
charter
was
delivering
the
money
to
them.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
well,
not
for
that
reason,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
the
reason
is
as
follows.
this
is
what
they
refer
to
as
barter
contracts,
two
companies
exchanging
things,
which
is
perfectly
legitimate,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
and
there
are
certain
ways
to
account
for
it
properly,
and
what
arthur
andersen
was
telling
charter
was
in
order
to
be
able
to
have
revenues
included,
gross
revenues,
you
have
to
have
unrelated...
unrelated
contracts.
they
couldn't
be
a
barter
transaction.
but
there
is
no
way...
no
way
that
you
could
recognize
the
advertising
revenues
if--
you're
using
charter's
own
money,
and
that's
what
arthur
andersen
did
not
do.
it
would
be
no
different,
justice
scalia,
if
charter
delivered
a
suitcase
filled
with
cash
and
gave
it
to
them
and
said
okay,
buy
the
advertising
from
us.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
no.
you
can
barter.
you
can
barter,
it's
just
a
question
of
how
you
account
for
it.
but
the
bartering
is
one
thing.
i
mean,
that's
one
accounting
principle
relating
to
bartering,
but
there
is
no
accounting
principle
that
permits
the
recording
of
revenue
if
you're
using
the
money
from
the
seller.
and
that's
why
they
disguised--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--yes.
and
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
because
the
advertising
contract--
was
a
sham,
and
the
advertising
contract
was
a
sham
because
charter
was
giving
the
respondents
the
money
to
buy
the
advertising.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
the
difference
is
here
we
would
have
conceptual--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--there
has
to
be
a
deception...
there
is
deception.
the
deception
is
you're
entering
into
an
advertising
contract
that
presents
the
illusion
that
you
were
purchasing
advertising,
when
in
fact
you
were
not
purchasing
the
advertising.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
there
was
no
way...
no
way--
that
that
could
properly
be
accounted
for,
and
the
respondents
understood
that.
and
that's
why
they
did
what
they
did,
that's
what--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--well,
i
think
the
limitations
are
as
follows,
your
honor.
number
one,
there
has
to
be
the
purpose
of
furthering
a
scheme
to
defraud
shareholders.
number
two,
the
test
has
an
element
of
materiality,
that
it
cannot
be--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--well,
that
may
be
that
they
didn't
care
about
the
investors--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--well,
they
may
not
have
cared,
but
that
would
be
reckless
because
they
certainly--
understood--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--that's
correct.
if
you
just
close
your
eyes...
if
somebody
comes
to
you
and
says,
look,
we
want
you
to
enter
into
this
transaction,
it's
a
phony
transaction
and
we
don't
care...
do
whatever
you
want
with
that,
and
they
know
it's
a
publicly
held
corporation
and
they
have
every
reason
to
understand
that
this
information--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--well,
they
shouldn't
engage
in
schemes
to
defraud,
that's
what
congress
intended
by
section
10.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
that
they
have
to
commit
the
deceptive
act--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--with
the
requisite
intent.
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
it
is
not
on
my
judgment.
it
has
to
be
pled
with
the
particularity
required
by
the
pslra.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
no,
there
are
cases,
i
think,
your
honor,
where
they
can
engage
in
deceptive
conduct,
and
there
would
not
be
the
purpose
to
defraud
shareholders.
for
instance,
charter
may
have
come
to--
them
and
said
look,
do
me
a
favor,
says
the
sales
manager.
i
want
to
make
my
numbers
for
this
period
so
i
can
take
my
wife
on
a
trip
to
hawaii
that
the
company
will
give
me.
so
the
company
gives
him
a
phony
order,
thinking
that's
the
purpose
of
it.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
phony
order
to
help
this
guy
along.
well,
you've
engaged
in
a
deceptive
act.
it
may
be
deceptive
under
10(b),
but
you
wouldn't
satisfy
the
"purpose"
test,
because
the
purpose--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--you
have
to
engage
in
a
deceptive
act
under
10(b).
10(b)
prohibits
any
deceptive
act.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
exactly.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
no.
i...
i
understood,
perhaps
mistakenly,
from
justice
scalia
that
there
wasn't
a
deceptive
act
in
your
hypothetical.
if
there
is
a
deceptive
act,
then
it's
prohibited
by
10(b),
and
we
move
to
the
next
statute--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--no.
not
at
all.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
you,
yourself...
you,
yourself,
have
to
engage
in
the
deceptive
act.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
your
own
deceptive
act.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
you
may
be
a
principal
if
you
satisfy
the
other
elements
of
our
test,
which
are
serious
elements
that
you
have
to
plead
with--
particularity,
with
the
heightened
pleading
standards,
that
they
have
the
purpose
to
further
a
scheme
to
defraud.
that's
very
different--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--no.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
there
are
tests.
you
have
to
take
it
the
next
step
further,
because
whether
or
not
that
deceptive
act
had
the
purpose
and
effect
of
furthering
a
scheme
on
investors.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
an
aider
or
abettor?
you
have
to
have--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--an
aider...
certainly...
certainly,
the
primary
violator
in
the
situation
that
we
are
discussing
where
there
are
deceptive
acts
is
aiding
and
abetting.
i
mean,
if
an
accountant
comes
in
and
deliberately
falsifies
a
financial
statement,
he
is--
giving
substantial
assistance
to
the
company's
statement...
the
company
who
is
issuing
those
false
statements.
he
would
be
an
aider
and
abettor
in
that
sense.
he
is
also
a
primary--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--no.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
if
you
facilitate
with
a
deceptive
act,
then
you're
a
primary
violator.
that's
what
section
10(b)
prohibits.
if
you
facilitate
without
a
deceptive
act,
then
you
are
an
aider
and
abettor.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
yes.
we
are
not
seeking
that
at
all,
your
honor.
we...
the
pslra
proportionate
liability
provisions
govern
this
with
respect
to--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--we
would
measure
the
damages,
number
one,
that
flow
from
this
particular
scheme.
we
would
have
to
first
subtract
the
settlements
that
have
been
achieved
already,
and
then
the
proportionate
liability
provisions
of
the
pslra
provide
how
you
make
this
determination.
you
look
at
the
particular
nature
of
their
conduct,
and
you
look
at
the
extent
to
which
their
particular
conduct
had
a
causal
relationship
with
the
damages.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
well,
i...
i
think
you
can
go
so
long
as
the
person's
deceptive
conduct
has
the
purpose
of
furthering
a
scheme
to
defraud.
if
they
engage
in
some
deceptive
conduct
that
was
not
in
furtherance
of
the
scheme
to
defraud,
that's
the
end
of
the
chain.
i--
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
grossman
thank
you.
i...
excuse
me,
i
have
three
quick
points
to
make.
one,
mr.
shapiro
and
mr.
hungar
both
said--
that
the
advertising
cost
the
vendors
no
money.
well,
if
the
advertising
cost
them
no
money,
why
was
there
a
contract
that
they
entered
into
for
the
purchase
of
advertising?
clearly
it
was
designed
to
give
the
false
appearance
that
charter
had
this
additional
$17
million
in
revenue.
number
two,
the
sec
did
take
a
position
in
the
simpson
case
as
it
submitted
an
amicus
brief;
commissioner
cox
testified
before
a
house
committee
this
past
spring
that
they
wanted
to
submit
the
same
brief
on
the
same
points
supporting
the
position
that
we
are
taking
here;
and
the
testimony
of
commissioner
cox
is
appended
to
the
briefs
of
congressmen
franks
and
conyers.
number
three,
central
bank
did
not
turn
on
reliance.
central
bank
turned
on
the
issue
of
deceptive
conduct.
there
was
no
deceptive
conduct
in
that
case.
the
plaintiffs
conceded
there
was
no
deceptive
conduct;
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
said
there
was
no
deceptive
conduct;
it
was
strictly
an
aiding-and-abetting
case.
with
respect
to
the
reliance
issue
in
central
bank,
what
the
court
did
say
was
under
plaintiff's
theory
he
wouldn't
have
to
prove
reliance.
he
only
had
to
prove
that
he...
that
the
defendant--
substantially
assisted
a
defendant
who
engaged
in
a
primary
violation,
but
he
would
not
have
to
prove
any
reliance
by
the
aiding
and
abettor.
number
three,
with
respect
to
20(e),
how
do
my
friends
on
the
other
side
read
20(e)
in
connection
with
section
9
and
section
18
of
the
exchange
act,
each
of
which
provides
remedies
and
private
rights
of
actions
against
multiple
parties?
under
their
definition,
that
would
appear
to
be
displaced
by
20(e).
20(e)
was
not
designed,
it
was
not
intended
to
do
anything
but
to
give
the
sec
the
right
to
bring
the
very
type
of
aiding-and-abetting
action
that
this
court
barred
in
central
bank.
