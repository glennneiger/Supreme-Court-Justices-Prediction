justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
grossman,
is
there
any
reason
why,
in
principle,
the
elements
for
a
cause
of
action
under
10b-5
have
to
be
the
same
as
the
elements
for
a
cause
of
action
by
the
agency
under
10(b)?
i
mean,
we,
we
created
this,
this
cause
of
action.
it's
not
set
forth
in
the
statute,
although
other
private
causes
of
action
are.
if
it's
our
creation,
couldn't
we
sensibly
limit
it
so
that,
for
example,
schemes
can
be
attacked
by
the
sec,
but
schemes
do
not
form
the
basis
for
private
attorney
general's
actions?
you
need
actual
conveyance
of
a
misrepresentation
to
the
injured
party.
is
there
any
reason
why
we
couldn't
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
intended
or
known?
i
mean,
i
don't
see...
what's
in
it
for
scientific-atlanta
to
defraud
the
shareholders?
is
it
enough
that
they
just
knew
it
would
be
used
for
that
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when
you
say
"in
furtherance
of",
you...
you
import
intent.
they
didn't
care
what
charter
was
going
to
do
with
it,
but
they
pretty
well
knew
that
what
charter
was
going
to
do
was
to
make
its
books
look
better.
would
that
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
your
position
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
an
intent
necessarily.
it's
just
knowledge.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
after
trial...
you
know,
after
trial
which
causes
your
stock
to
tank,
you
may
indeed
be
able
to
show
that
you
didn't
know
it
was
going
to
be
used
for
that
purpose.
i
mean,
that's
what
this
is
all
about,
isn't
it,
getting
it...
getting
it
by
the
summary-judgment
stage?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
facts...
what
has
to
be
alleged
short
of...
on
information
and
belief
the
defendant
knew
that...
that
this
information
would
appear
on
the
balance
sheets
and
be
used
to
improve
the
status
of
the
stock?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
exactly
the
thing
they
told
them
to
separate.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
say
that
they
can't
be
connected,
you're
saying
precisely,
you
can't
be
bartering
the
advertising
revenue
for
the
increased
money
that
you're
paying.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
don't
aiders
and
abettors
have
to
have
that
purpose
as
well?
what
distinguishes...
what
distinguishes
the
liability
that
you
propose
from
aider
and
abettor
liability?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
any
aiding-and-abetting
through
a
deceptive
act
makes
you
a
principal?
is
that
it?
you
can't
be
an
aider
and
abettor
by
committing
or
enabling
a
deceptive
act
without
becoming
a
principal?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
but
if
you
do,
or
if
you
should
have
known,
you
are
not
an
aider
and
abettor.
you
are
automatically
a
principal.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
fair
to
say
that
all
aiders
and
abettors
who
commit
deceptive
acts
are
principals?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
difference?
what
separates
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
need
that
to
be
an
aider
or
abettor?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i'm
entirely
innocent,
and
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
see,
i
really
thought
the
difference
was
that
the
principal
is
the
one
who
makes
the
deceptive
representation
and
obtains
money
from
it.
the
aider
and
abettor
is
the
person
who
facilitates
or
enables
that
deceptive
representation,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
if
you
facilitate
knowingly
and
intentionally
or
even
grossly
negligently,
you
are
not
an
aider
and
abettor,
but
you're
a
principal.
i
really
don't
understand
what's
the
line
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
amend
that
to--
say...
you
don't
insist
that
he
make
a
statement
that
invest...
he
could
engage
in
a
deceptive
practice
directed
at
investments?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that
you
are
either
a
principal
or
an
aider
and
abettor?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
same
act,
i'm
talking
about...
for
the
same
act.
