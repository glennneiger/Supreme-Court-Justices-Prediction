we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-43,
stoneridge
investment
partners
v.
scientific-atlanta,
et
al..
mr.
grossman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

but
it's
not
like
under
the
sherman
act,
where
we
have
reason
to
think
congress
intended
the
court
to
go
about
the
business
of
construing
and
developing
antitrust
law.
in
fact,
they
have
kind
of
taken
over
for
us.
they
are
imposing
certain
limits
on
when
actions
can
be
brought,
proposing
particular
specific
elements.
in
one
of
the
provisions,
20(e),
specifying
the
sec
can
bring
an
action
but
private
investors
can't.
i
mean,
we
don't
get
in
this
business
of
implying
private
rights
of
action
any
more.
and
isn't
the
effort
by
congress
to
legislate
a
good
signal
that
they
have
kind
of
picked
up
the
ball
and
they
are
running
with
it
and
we
shouldn't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
kind
of
my
point.
we
did
that
sort
of
thing
in
1971.
we
haven't
done
it
for
quite
sometime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not...
my
suggestion
is
not
that
we
should
go
back
and
say
that
there
is
no
private
right
of
action.
my
suggestion
is
that
we
should
get
out
of
the
business
of
expanding
it,
because
congress
has
taken
over
and
is
legislating
in
the
area
in
a
way
they
weren't
back
when
we
implied
the
right
of
action
under
10(b).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it...
is
it
a
necessary
part
of
your
theory
that
the
deceptive
practice
that
scientific-atlanta
went
in,
that
they
knew
that
that
was
also...
that
charter
would
carry
that
forward?
i
mean,
let's
suppose
that
there
were
benefits
to
this
deceptive
practice
to
scientific-atlanta,
that
it
looked
like
it
had
more
money
to
spend
on
advertising
than
it
really
did,
but
they
didn't
care
what
charter
did
with
it.
in
fact,
they
didn't
know
that
charter
was
going
to
carry
it
on
its
books
the
way
they
did.
would
there
still
be
liability
for
scientific-atlanta?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
shouldn't
we
be--
guided
by
what
congress
did
in
reaction
to
the
central
bank
case?
there
we
said
there's
no
aiding-and-abetting
liability,
congress
amended
the
statute
in
20(e)
to
say
yes,
there
is,
but
private
plaintiffs
can't
sue
on
that
basis.
why
shouldn't
that
inform
how
we
further
develop
the
private
action
under
10b-5?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
were...
they
were
addressing
a
very
specific
decision
from
this
court,
the
central
bank
decision.
and
the
one
thing
they
did
not
do
is
say
that
that
decision
was
wrong
with
respect
to
private...
or
going
forward
they
weren't
going
to
overrule
that
decision
with
respect
to
private
rights
of
action.
you're
asking
us
to
extend
to
non...
i
know
you
call
it
a
primary
violator,
but
not
the
person
who--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--who
put
the--
deceptive
conduct
into
the
market.
you're
asking
us
to
extend
that
liability
to
them,
which
seems
inconsistent
with
congress's
approach
in
20(e).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's...
but
that's
not
the
fraud
that
was
imposed
upon
the
market.
the
fraud
that
was
imposed
on
the
market
was
charter's
accounting
for
the
transaction
on
its
books.
nobody
bought
or
sold
stock
in
reliance
upon
the
way
that
scientific-atlanta
and
charter
structured
their
deal.
they
did
so
in
reliance
on
the
way
that
charter
communicated
its
accounting
to
the
marketplace.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--mr.
grossman,
i'm
conscious
of
eating
into
your
time
but
a
question...
how
many
chains
of
this
connection
can
you
have?
let's
say
charter
was
not
a
publicly
traded
company,
but
same
thing
happened
with
respect
to
scientific-atlanta,
and
that
made
it
look
valuable
to
a
company
that
is
publicly
traded.
so
they
decided
to
buy
charter
and
then
that
made
their
profits
look
better
to
investors.
can
you--
how
many
chains
in
the
link
can
you
go?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
grossman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
shapiro,
what
i
understood
to
be
his
argument,
that
20(e),
the
aider
and
abettor
statute,
more
or
less
occupies
the
field
here
and
there
is
no--
role
for
additional
10b-5
liability?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
at
least
a
little
awkward
for
you
to
say
we
should
wait
for
a
case
in
which
it's
been
fully
presented
when
the
argument
you're
making
here
wasn't
fully
presented,
or
at
least
not
decided
below.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understood
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
to
be
based
on
its
determination
that
there
was
no
deceptive
act
because
there
was
no
statement
or
omission.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
grossman,
have
you
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
grossman.
the
case
is
submitted.
