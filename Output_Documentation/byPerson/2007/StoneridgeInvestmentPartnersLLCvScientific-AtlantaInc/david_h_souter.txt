justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
it's
more
than
knowledge.
i
mean,
you
mentioned
recklessness.
it's
got
to
have
either
knowledge
of
or
a
willingness
to
maintain
an
indifference
to
the
consequence.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it
is
the
difference
between
aiding
and
abetting
liability
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
and
liability
as,
in
effect,
as
first
line
principles,
is
their
intent,
or
at
the
very
least
in
knowledge
that
they
were
committing
a
deceptive
act
as
part
of
this--
scheme.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
how
many
times
are
parties
of
the
position
of
respondents
ever
going
to
engage
in
those
acts
except
with
exactly
the
state
of
mind
that
on
your
judgment
makes
them
principals,
rather
than
aiders
and
abettors.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
no,
i
realize
that
you
have
to
plead
it.
what
i'm
getting
at
is:
are
you
making
a
distinction
that
in
the
real
world
is
not
a
distinction?
that,
in
reality,
no
one
is
going
to
do
what
these
respondents
did
without
the
kind
of
knowledge
or
intent
that
makes
them,
on
your
theory,
principals
rather
than
aiders
or
abettors?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it's
deceptive
but
not
deceptive
in
relation
to,
or
for
the
purpose
of,
deceiving
the...
someone
like
the
petitioner.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
were
telling
me
that
in
each
case
there
may
be
a
deceptive
act
but
not
a
deceptive
act
in
relation
to
somebody
like
the
petitioner
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
different
answer,
i
think,
from
the
one
you
were
just
giving
justice
scalia.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
defend
the
position--
justice
david
h.
souter
--now,
i
take
it,
though,
you--
do
not
defend
the
position
that
there
must...
for
10(b)
liability...
that
there
must
have
been
a
statement
addressed
to
investors.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
you
answer
my
question
first?
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
can
be
no
10(b)
liability
without
a
statement
addressed
to
investors?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
the
statement
as
such
or
a
statement
which
could
not
have
been
made
but
for
the
statements
of
the
respondents
must
be
communicated
to
the
investors?
which
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
are
you...
so
you
are
saying
that
there
can
be
no
causation
and
hence,
you
know...
and
i
think
you're
going
further.
you're
saying--
there
can
be
no
liability
within
the
description
of
10(b)
unless
there
is
a
statement
directly
addressed
to
the
investors,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
what
about
in
this--
case?
let's
be
specific.
as
i
understood
an
earlier
answer
of
yours,
the
answer
was
that
arthur
andersen
knew
what
was
going
on.
if
i've...
if
you
are...
and
as
i
understand
it,
that's
not
what
was
charged...
but
if
that's
correct,
arthur
andersen
did
know
what
was
going
on.
can
arthur
andersen
be
held
liable
under
10b-5--
justice
david
h.
souter
--whereas
your
client
cannot?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
difference
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
if
arthur
andersen--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
if
arthur
andersen
has
a
footnote
in
there
saying,
this
is
okay
because
we
have--
this...
this
letter
from
i
forget
which
one
of
the
two
respondents
it
was,
saying
there's
been
inflation
and
therefore
we've
got
to
renegotiate
the
prices
and
jack
them
up
20
percent,
arthur
andersen
knows
that
that
is
false
and
the
respondent
who
made
it
knows
that
it
is
false,
can
the
respondent
who
made
it
then
be
held
liable?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
doesn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
doesn't...
doesn't
the
respondent
in
that
case
know
that
it
is
likely
that
the
auditor
is
going
to
indicate
the
basis
for
its
statement,
that
the
transaction
is
okay--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and,
therefore,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
anticipated
that
their
statement
would
be
communicated
to
the
market?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
a
communication
to
the
market
there--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
there's
a
reason
to
expect
that
communication.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
make
any
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
word
"only"
in
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
word
"only"
in
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
have
an
independent
defense
quite
apart
from...
from
the
construction
of
10b-5?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
there
is
reliance
and
loss
causation.
let
me
ask
a
question
very
similar
to
what
justice
ginsburg
has
posed
a
couple
of
times.
she
has
said
is
there
a
third
category.
my
question
is,
is
there
an
overlap?
can
there
be
an
overlap?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
intended
an
expert
agency
to
address
solely
aiding-and-abetting
cases.
my
question
is
if
there
is
an
overlap...
a,
can
there
be
an
overlap?
and
if
so,
i
don't
see
why
congress's
intent
to
reserve
aiding-and-abetting
alone
to
the
agency
affects
the
determination
of
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
for
example,
for
example,
let's
assume
in
this
case
that
charter
said
we've,
we've
got
to
let
the
investors
know
that
our
cost
of
doing
business
is
going
up,
and
we
want
to
you
make
an
announcement
that
you're
jacking
up
your
price
20
percent.
in
that
case
there
would
be
primary
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
in
that
case
is
there
not
also
aiding-and-abetting?
we
know
perfectly
well
why
they
are
doing
it,
and
they
are
doing
it
solely
to
aid
and
abet
charter
in
its
scheme
themselves
enjoying
a
wash
transaction.
why
isn't
that
both
primary
and
aiding-and-abetting?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
know
it's
primary.
why
isn't
it
also
aiding-and-abetting?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
can
call
it,
why
isn't
there
the
kind
of
overlap
which
raises
the
question
that
justice
ginsburg
has
raised?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
saying
there
can
be
an
overlap
but
there
is
no
overlap
that
helps
the
petitioner
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
has
the
sec
publicly
taken
a
position
on
that
question?
