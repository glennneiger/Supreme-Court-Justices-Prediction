mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
each
of
the
three
rulings
at
issue
here
rests
firmly
in
the
mainstream
of
american
tort
law.
and
there
is
no
reason
in
maritime
jurisprudence
to
depart
from
those
rules.
i
want
to
start
with
the
first
question
presented,
what
exxon
calls
the
vicarious
liability
issue.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
frame
the
discussion
by
starting
with
the
actual
jury
instruction
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
it's
at
pet.
app.
301a.
it
says
that
a
managerial
agent
is
someone
who
supervises
other
employees
and
has
responsibility
for,
and
authority
over,
particular
aspects
of
a
corporation's
business.
and,
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
exxon
has
never
disputed
that
captain
hazelwood
satisfied
this
definition.
as
its
own
internal
documents
explain,
captain
hazelwood
was
in
charge
of
what
they
called
a
business
unit
of
exxon
shipping.
he
was
in
charge
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
equipment,
of
product;
he
was
in
charge
of
budgeting
and
personnel
with
respect
to
the
vessel;
he
was
also
in
charge
of
safety.
he
was
the
person
who
decided
on
behalf
of
exxon
that
it
was
safe
to
leave
port
the
night
of
march
23,
1989.
now,
it
is
our
submission
that
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
to
expose
the
corporation
to
punitive
damages
based
on
the
reckless
acts
of
such
an
individual.
in
doing
so,
it
does
not,
as
exxon
would
contend,
impose
vicarious
liability.
rather,
what
it
does
is
it
exposes
a
corporation
to
liability
based
on
its
own
culpability.
the
very
point
of
the
restatement
test,
as
opposed
to
the
vicarious
liability
rule
that
is
followed
by
the
majority
of
the
states,
is
that
it
requires
some
complicity
on
the
part
of
the
corporation.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
not
for
punitive
damages,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
reason
why
is
because
the
lookout
does
not
run
a
business
unit
of
exxon
shipping.
what
is
happening
here...
and
i
want
to
focus
on
this
for
a
moment
because
mr.
dellinger--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
what
exxon
regarded
the
ship
as,
and
so
that's
what
the
record
says.
and
the
idea
is
that
you
had--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
don't
want
to
rest
primarily
on
labels.
the
idea
is
function.
and
i
think,
going
back
to
the
instruction,
what
the
instruction
is
asking
the
jury
to
determine
is:
is
this
a
person
who
has
authority
over
an
aspect
of
a
corporation's
business?
i
think
a
shorthand
for
that
is
in
exxon's
own
documents
that
it
is--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
the
authority--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--there
are
about
20
vessels
like
the
valdez.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
now,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
had
it
right
when
he
said
it's
no
answer
to
say
it
can't
be
the
master;
it
has
to
be
the
corporation.
the
corporation
can
only
act
through
people.
so
there
has
to
be
a
line
drawing
that
takes
place.
now,
this
notion
of
the
idea
that
the
master
isn't
good
enough
because
he
had
to
be
a
policymaker
is
new
to
us.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
he
may
not
be.
i
don't
think
the
question
is
whether
he's
responsible
for
policy.
again,
it's
whether
he's
the
person
in
charge.
what
exxon
during
instruction
to
the
district
court
asked
the
jury
to
be
required
to
find
is
that
there
was
a
shore
based
supervisory
official
of
the
exxon
defendants
who
made
the
decision.
so
exxon
itself
recognized
that
you
have
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
we
think
the
best
place
to
draw
the
line,
and
the
conservative
place
to
law,
the
line
is
the
managerial
agent
rule
that's
in
the
restatement.
now,
mr.
dellinger
says
there
are
eight
states
that
follow
a
different
rule.
and
it's
important
to
understand
that
that's
not
the
case.
even
among
the
states
that
follow
the
lake
shore
formulation
in
general,
you
still
have
to
have
a
way
to
implement
it.
it's
not...
the
idea
is
if
the
corporation
has
to
be
complicit,
you
still
have
to
tell
the
jury
which
human
beings
they
can
look
to
for
that
complicity.
so
at
page
33
of
our
red
brief--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--there
was
no
captain
at
issue
in
amiable
nancy.
and,
of
course,
there
wasn't
a
captain
at
issue
in
lake
shore,
because
it
was
a
land
based
case.
but
on
page
33
of
our
red
brief
we've
given
you
seven...
several
states
that
say
we
follow
the
complicity
test,
and
here's
how
you
do
it.
you
require
the
jury
to
find
that
the
person
is
at
least
a
managerial
agent.
exxon
itself
in
its
reply
brief
on
page...
page
11,
footnote
5,
cites
several
states.
and
i
gather
these
are
the
states
to
which
mr.
dellinger
is
referring
when
he
says
there
are
eight
states
that
follow
our
rule.
well,
we
did
some
research
after
getting
the
reply
brief,
and
i
want
to
give
you
a
few
cites,
because
it
illustrates
the
principle
yet
again.
several
of
those
states
say
we
follow
the
lake
shore
complicity
idea.
and,
therefore,
the
way
we
do
it
is
we
require
a
jury
to
find
at
least
a
managerial
agent.
so
kansas
is
a
state
that
exxon
cites.
in
the
flint
hills
case
at
941
p.
2d
374,
kansas
says
the
way
in
modern
times
you
implement
lake
shore
is
you
require
a
managerial
agent.
in
connecticut,
the
stoltz
case
867
a.
2d
860,
and
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
justice
scalia,
they
quote
one
of
your
opinions.
if
you
look
at
d.c.
law,
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
itself
and
a
d.c.
circuit
in
another
case
have
said...
and
this
is
the
arthur
young
case,
631
a.
2d
354,
and
the
gmac
case
at
273
f.
2d
92--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no
state
tort
case
that
we're
aware
of,
justice
kennedy,
adopts...
i
think
what
you're
referring
to
is
the
kolstad
policy
exception.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
i
want
to
say
two
things.
the
first
is
that,
as
i
understand
it,
exxon
has
conceded
across
the
board
that
captain
hazelwood
is
a
managerial
agent.
and
in
this
case...
in
this
court's
own
kolstad
case,
if
you
look
at
it
again,
it
says
amiable
nancy,
lake
shore
and
the
way
you
implement
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
if
you
were
to
adopt
a
rule
that
no
other
state
has
adopted,
which
is
to
say
there
was
a
policy
defense
in
ordinary
tort
cases,
which
unlike
kolstad
do
not
rest
on
the
subjective
knowledge
of
the
actor,
even
then,
we
submit,
we
tried
that
issue
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy;
and
there
was...
exxon
had
every
opportunity
to
argue
policy.
in
its
closing
argument
to
the
jury,
the
only
policy
it
mentioned
was
the
policy
of
two
officers
on
the
bridge
while
transporting--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
we
think
that's
the
proper
rule
of
law.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
don't
want
to
act
like
a
dog
chasing
his
tail
here,
justice
kennedy,
but
the
idea
is
to
ask
whether
the
corporation
is
culpable,
you
have
to
ask
which
people.
and
what
happened
in
this
court's
own
decision
in
kolstad
said
in
implementing
lake
shore
that
you
look
to
the
managerial
agents.
and
that's
what--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--three
reasons,
justice
breyer.
the
first
is
with
all
due
respect,
amiable
nancy
did
not
involve
the
wrongdoing
of
the
captain.
it
involved
the
wrongdoing
of
a
lower
officer
on
the
ship;
and
so
it's...
there's
nothing
in
the
amiable
nancy
that
deals
with
captains,
so
you
don't
have
a
stare
decisis
effect
that
comes
from
amiable
nancy
with
respect
to
captains.
the
second
thing
is
there
are
some
more
recent
federal
cases
that
discuss
the
lake
shore
managerial
agent
idea.
we've
cited
them
in
our...
in
our
red
brief
along
through...
i'm
flipping
now...
but
there
are
rico
cases;
there
are
other
cases,
and
mr.
dellinger
said,
where
statutory
case...
statutory
regimes
need
to
be
implemented.
and
we
have
cited
several
lower
court
decisions
that
look
to
the
managerial
agent
rule
to
do
that,
none
of
this
court.
the
third
thing
is
to
understand,
as
you
talked
about
in
lake
shore,
you
are
having
to
pick
somebody,
and
the
general
idea
is
higher
up
is
okay,
and
way
down
low
is
not
okay.
fletcher
in
his
cyclopedia
on
corporations
says
that
if
the
lake
shore
idea
is
to
make
sense
today,
you
have
to
understand
that
when
you're
dealing
with
humongous
corporations,
you
have
to
look
not
just
to
the
president
or
vice
president...
and
this
is
what
the
d.c.
circuit
said
in
the
gmac
case
as
well...
is
that
when
you
deal
with
multinational
corporations
with
tens
of
thousands
of
employees
and
divisions,
you
look
to...
you
look
a
little
bit
lower
down
than
those
top
job
titles
to
managers.
and
so
again
this
is
what
professor
schoenbaum
says
in
his
amicus
brief
to
this
court
dealing
with
that
from
a
maritime
perspective.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
it
would
not
be,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
we
did--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--what
we
did
our
reply
brief...
i'm
sorry,
what
we
did
in
our
red
brief
is
cite
to
professor
robertson's
article
in
saying
that
he
collected
the
cases,
and
which
he
did;
and
so
our
best
cases
are
the
city
of
carlisle
case,
the
ludlow
and
ralston
against
states
rights
is
very
close.
there's
a
distinction
in
ralston
versus
exemplary--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--we
don't
think
that's
the
right
reading
of
the
case.
we
submit...
we
have
a
footnote
in
our
own
brief
that
says
that
there
are
only
two
cases
that
they
cite
in
which
a
captain's
conduct
is
not
imputed
to
the
ship's
owner.
they
are
both
more
than
100
years
old,
and
neither
of
them
deal
with
corporations.
so
i
think
it
is
entirely
fair
to
say
that
you
have
more
or
less
an
open
issue
before
you
today.
what
i
think
i
want
to
be
sure
the
court
understands,
though,
is
that
there
is
not
a
stare
decisis
problem
that
this
court
has
to
confront
with
respect
to
the
first
question.
you
have
a
spattering
of
a
few
old
cases
that
lean
in
different
directions.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
because
neither
amiable
nancy
nor
the
lake
shore
case,
which
are
the
only
two
cases
from
this
court,
dealt
with
a
managerial
agent.
the
more
recent
cases
from
this
court,
hydrolevel
and
kolstad...
hydrolevel
says
any
agent
for
treble
damages
for
antitrust,
and
kolstad
follows
the
managerial
agent
principle,
following
in
the
natural
evolution
of
amiable
nancy
and
lake
shore.
so
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
considered
it
to
be
any
stare
decisis
problem,
even
if
all
of
the
lower
courts
were
lined
up
against
it,
which
is
far
from
the...
far
from
the
case
here.
what
you
have
is
a
just
few
lower
courts
in
either
correction.
i
gather
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
court
decided
to
grant
certiorari
in
this
case,
because
there's
some
dispute
among
the
lower
courts
as
to
exactly
how
this
principle
works
in
maritime
law.
but
again,
we
don't
think
there's
any
problem
with
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
said
one
of
the
reasons,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
kolstad
starts
from
the
proposition
of
managerial
agent
is
the
proper
way
to
implement
a
complicity
rule.
there's
a
second
part
of
kolstad
that
says
we
have
to
change
what
we
think
is
the
ordinary
common
law
rule,
the
proper
federal
common
law
rule.
we
have
to
change
it
in
the
context
of
title
vii
because
of
the
unusual
situation
in
which
employers
can
be
held
liable
based
on
the
subjective
knowledge
of
the
wrongdoer;
and
tort
law
is
exactly
the
opposite.
it
is
an
objective
test.
and
so
there's
no
worry
in
imposing
punitive
damages
here,
that
you're
going
to...
that
you're
going
to
dissuade
an
employer
from
training
its
employees.
now,
on
the
facts,
even
if
you
were
to
agree
with
me
on
that
legal
argument,
you're
exactly
right
on
the
facts,
justice
ginsburg.
exxon
had
a
paper
alcohol
policy
that
prohibited
drinking
aboard
ship,
just
like
the
coast
guard
has
a
policy
to
that
effect.
but
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
exxon
didn't
enforce
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
on
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--on
the
first
part
of
the
case
in
phase
one
that
was
our...
that
was
the
legal
theory,
justice...
you're
right,
justice
kennedy.
but
in
phase
three
of
the
trial
when
a
jury
decided
whether
to
award
punitive
damages,
the
instructions
told
it,
among
other
things...
this
is
instruction
30
in
phase
three...
it
told
among
other
things
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
wrongdoers
were
violating
company
policy.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i...
i
accept
that,
and
i
think
i've
explained
that
by
distinguishing
an
ordinary
tort
case
from
the
situation
in
title
vii.
i
think
it's
instructive
for
this
court,
and
we
agree
with
exxon
that
when
this
court
sits
as
a
maritime
court,
it
looks
for
guidance
to
what
other
state
courts
have
done.
and
we
think
it's
instructive
that
not
one
single
state
court,
either
before
or
after
kolstad,
has
adopted
a
policy
defense
for
defendants.
there's
simply
no
such
decision
on
the
books
outside
of
discrimination
cases.
we
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--in
a
tort
case,
your
honor?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
we
think...
and
that's...
and
that's
what
instruction
justice
kennedy--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
it
can
hire
fit
and
competent
people
who
it
decides--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--apart
from
adopting
a
policy,
they
need
to
implement
it
soundly.
and
the
argument
you're
making,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
would
obtain
just
as
easily
if
the
vice
president
of
exxon
corporation
or
the
president
of
exxon
shipping,
whom
mr.
dellinger
says
would
put
exxon
on
the
hook,
had
made
the
decision
to
put
joe
hazelwood
in
command
of
this
ship.
and
so
you
always
have
the
problem--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
in
some...
i
think
in
some
respects
we're
back
to
the
argument
of
where
you
draw
the
line.
but
let's
look
at
the
conduct
in
this
case.
who
made
the
decision
that
it
was
safe
to
depart
port
that
night
on
behalf
of
exxon
corporation?
captain
hazelwood.
the
record
unequivocally
says
that
captain
hazelwood
is
the
one
who
made
that
policy
decision.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
if
we're
to
the
point
where
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
policy
was
enforced,
we'll
very
happily
rest
on
the
record
in
this
case,
because
that
was
what
we
tried
to
the
jury:
that
there
was
no
serious
alcohol
policy
that
was
enforced.
we
showed
33
instances
in
the
record
of
exxon
employees
drinking
with
hazelwood
or
learning
that
he
drank.
up
and
down
the
corporation,
as
the
district
judge
explained,
for
three
years,
upper
management
was
receiving
reports
that
this
man
was
drinking
aboard
the
vessel.
now,
its
policy,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
that
was
not
allowed.
but
over
a
three
year
span,
as
the
district
judge
found
again
and
again
and
again,
they
were
told
there
was
a
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
you
assume--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
two...
two
points,
justice
breyer:
on
answering
the
first
question
presented--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--you
assume--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--unless
we
can
show...
unless
we
can
make
an
overwhelming
harmless
errors--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
second
and
third,
i
think
you
assume
the
facts--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
this
is
the
perfect
segue
from
the
first
and
third
questions.
as
i
transfer
there,
i
want
to
point
out
that
i
think
the
only
reason
that
we
heard
in
the
first...
the
first
portion
of
the
argument
for
absolving
exxon
of
responsibility
in
the
situation
is
because
of
the
dangerousness
of
captaining
vessels
like
this.
this
court
has
already
addressed
that
concern
in
its
collision
doctrine,
and
tort
law
generally
addresses
the
problem
of
dangerous
activities
and
split
second
decisions.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
they
are
simply
not
reckless
when
somebody
makes
a
good
faith
decision
in
a
crisis
in
the
midst
of
dangerous
activity.
so
we
don't
think
there's
any
special
rule
that
is
necessary
with
respect
to
the
first
question
presented.
now,
you
asked
me
how
do
deal
with
it
in
terms
of
the
size
of
the
award.
we
think...
first
of
all,
i
think
that
if
i
can
beg
to
differ
slightly
with
the
way
you
framed
it,
as
professor
robertson
explained,
punitive
damages
are...
have
always
been
firmly
established
in
maritime
law.
and
then
just
because
there
haven't
been
that
many
cases
doesn't
tell
you
that
they've
been
frowned
upon.
it
just
means
that
we
haven't
had
that
many
cases
that
have
resulted
in
reported
decisions.
now,
in
looking
to
guidance,
this
court
isn't
sitting
as
a
maritime
court.
so
it...
it's
siting
as
a
common
law
type
court.
we
think
the
best
place
to
start
is
with
the
common
law
tradition,
which
is
that
cases
are
tried
to
juries;
juries
make
the
first
decision;
and
then
the
trial
court
reviews
for
passion
and
prejudice
and
for
substantial
evidence,
as
our
trial
court
did
here.
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
reviews
that
for
abuse
of
discretion.
if
there's
anything
more
that's
necessary
in
maritime
law,
we
submit
congress
has
already
stepped
into
the
breach
with
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
a
constitutional
holding.
what
this
court
said
in
cooper
was
if--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
i'm
not
going
to
fight
you
on
that,
justice
kennedy.
there
was
an
earlier
sentence
in
cooper
that
says
if
no
constitutional
issue
is
raised,
the
only
thing
an
appellate
court
should
do
is
review
for
abuse
of
discretion.
but
i
think
that
ultimately
you
end
up
in
the
same
place,
which
is
that
there's
a
de
novo
review
of
the
excessive...
of
whether
the
award
is
excessive
based
on
the
facts
that
have
been...
that
have
been
tried.
and
if
this
court
is
going
to
adopt
a
set
of
guideposts
for
maritime
law,
we
think
the
proper
place
to
look
is
the
due
process
cases
this
court
has
already
decided.
this
court
has
already...
in
its
due
process
cases,
the
court
looked
to
the
common
law.
that's
where,
i
gather,
the
guideposts
this
court
adopted
came
from:
reprehensibility,
in
particular,
which
this
court
said
was
the
most
important
indicia,
as
well
as
a
reasonable
relationship,
what's
commonly
referred
to
as
the
"ratio
test".
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
i
accept
what
you
said,
justice
scalia.
the
third...
with
respect
to
the
size
of
the
award,
we
never
contested
exxon's
ability
to
argue
that
the
clean
water
act
is
one
place
you
can
look.
so,
if
you
were
to
look
to
the
clean
water
act,
you
initially
have
the
problem
that
justice
souter
mentioned.
you
have
the
apples
and
oranges
problem.
the
clean
water
act
sets
a
fine
cording
to
the
environmental
harm.
now,
the
state
of
alaska
had
that
estimated
in
its...
and
this
is
in
its
brief...
and
that
came
out
to
be...
i
believe
the
number
is
about
$2.6
billion.
so,
if
you
were
to
look...
if
you
were
to
put
aside
the
apples
and
oranges
problem
and
look
to
the
clean
water
act,
then
you
get
almost
the
number
that
we're
standing
here
with
today.
if
you
look
at
the
harm
a
different
way,
you
still
get
an
extremely
large
number.
you
get
$500
million
of
compensation
to
the
plaintiffs.
and
then
on
top
of
that,
we
think
in
light
of
the
way
this
court
has
addressed
ratio
analysis
in
its
other
cases,
you
need
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
there
are
vast
injuries
that
have
not
resulted
in
any
compensation.
so
to
do
any
kind
of--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
because
that's...
they
never
made
that
argument
in
the
district
court,
and
they
didn't
make
that
argument
to
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
they
didn't
make
that
argument,
but
if
they
had,
i
don't
think
it
ends
up
being
any
different
than
their
pre
emption
argument
because...
remember
their
pre
emption
argument
isn't
a
pure
pre
emption
argument.
they're
not
here
today
saying
the
plaintiffs
can't
recover
compensatory
damages,
as
was
the
case
in
the
milwaukee
and
illinois
case,
for
example.
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
clean
water
act
displaces
our
ability
to
recover
punitive
damages.
and
there,
by
making
the
argument
that
i
gather
you've
sketched
out,
it
looks
very
much
like
the
same
argument
that
they
didn't
properly
make.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but
it
doesn't--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
and
at
page
103
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
district
court
ruled
on
that
motion
and
held
that
tapaa
was
the
statute
that
was
controlling
with
respect
to
spills
of
trans
alaska
oil
and
that
the
savings
clause
of
tapaa
expressly
preserved
our
ability
to
seek
punitive
damages.
that's
a
ruling
that,
as
you
noted,
exxon
never
appealed,
and
so
it
is
the
law
of
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
as
i
said,
i
agree
you
should
look
to
it,
but
you
should
do
it
in
a
way
this
court's
miles
decision
instructs.
it
says
that
congress
doesn't
just
enact
general
policies.
by
enacting
a
statute
that
gives
some
protection,
congress
indicates
not
just
a
general
policy,
but
more
importantly,
the
sphere
into
which
that
policy
is
to
be
given
effect.
and
so
the
notion
that
congress
did
step
in
and
give
shipowners
some
protection
but
left
out
shipowners
like
exxon
that
behave
in
the
manner
at
issue
in
this
case,
we
think
is
a
strong--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think...
i
think
you
should
look
to
it
and
understand
that
congress
has
declined
to
give
the
protection.
in
opa
90,
which
was
passed
right
after
the
spill
in
direct
response
to
the
spill,
congress
made
explicit
that
the
limitation
act
should
never
apply
to
spills
of
trans-alaska
oil.
and
the
tapaa
did
the
same
thing
in
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
we
don't
think
we're
asking
for
any
kind
of
expansion
of
liability.
all
we're
asking
is
for
the
traditional
admiralty
rule
which
has
been
recognized
by
justice
story
early
on
and
all
through
the
cases
that
in
cases
of
reckless
indifference
a
shipowner
can
be
held
liable
for
punitive
damages.
the
only
thing--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
it
would...
i'll
stick
with
unwise,
justice
souter.
[laughter]
and
i
think
the
reason
why
is
because
we
agree
with
exxon.
you
should...
you
should
look
to
the
experience
of
the
states.
not
one
single
state,
as
a
matter
of
common
law
authority,
has
set
a
bright
line
ratio.
the
only
place--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--we
think
that's
one
place
this
court
can
look.
but
again,
a
common
law
court,
we
believe,
sets
standards,
not
a
bright
line
rule.
if
you
were
to
adopt
some
sort
of
bright
line
statute,
you'd
have
to
deal
with
any
number
of
legislative
problems
that
the
several
states
have
dealt
with
and
congress,
when
it
has
passed
these
kinds
of
limits.
first,
you
have
to
decide
the
ratio
number.
you
have
to
pull
something
out
there.
then
you
have
to
decide
is
it
on
a
per
capita
basis
in
terms
of...
what
several
states
have
done
is
they've
set
a
limit,
that
a
ratio
only
kicks
in
at
a
certain
dollar
amount.
in
this
case,
it's
worth
remembering
that
the
plaintiffs
are
only
standing
to
recover
$75,000
a
piece
in
punitive
damages.
now,
most
states
that
even
have
caps,
or
several
of
the
states
at
least,
say
they
don't
apply
if
the
awards
are
under
a
$100,000
per
capita.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but
the
theory--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
the
theory
of
the
states,
justice
breyer,
is
that
if
you
hurt
lots
and
lots
of
people,
it's
a
worse
act
than
if
you
only
hurt
one
or
two.
and
so
if
you
have,
as
in
this
case,
destroyed
an
entire
regional
economy,
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
give
some
sort
of
credit
for
that
by
a
lower
ratio
just
because
you've
harmed
more
people.
now,
there's
also--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
you've
looked
at
punishment
and
deterrence,
justice
kennedy.
and
if
i
could
finish
the
last
thing
i
want
to
say
about
looking
at
a
ratio,
several
states
that
even
have
ratios
carve
out
drunk
driving
cases
and
cases
involving
intoxication
from
any
other
otherwise
applicable
limits.
and
that's...
i
think
one
reason
why,
justice
kennedy,
is
deterrence.
and
so,
i
think
let's
start
with
deterrence,
but
i
want
to
frame
that
discussion
by
recognizing
that
in
cooper
this
court
said
that
deterrence
is
not
the
only
goal;
you
also
look
to
punishment.
now,
i
think
exxon's
primary
argument
on
deterrence
grounds
is
that
we've
paid
$3.4
billion
out
of
our
pocket
already
as
a
result
of
this
spill,
and
that's
a
lot
of
money.
the
reality
is,
once
they
get
their
tax
credit
and
insurance
benefits
for
that
money,
the
number
is
really
under
2
billion.
but
it's
still
a
lot
of
money.
and
so
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
district
court
proceedings
involving
the
clean
water
act,
involving
the
criminal
prosecution
here,
and
ask
whether
it
makes
sense
to
have
exxon
pay
additional
money
in
punitive
damages.
we
think
it
is.
the
first
thing
to
understand
is
that
the
same
district
judge
that
saw
the
criminal
proceedings
in
this
case
sat
over
our
trial.
he
understood
what
the
criminal
case
was
about,
and
what
it
was
about
was
the
environment.
that
was
only
thing
on
the
table
in
the
criminal
case.
and
so,
when
we
tried
to
argue--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--there
was
no
jury,
of
course,
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but
there
was
a
jury
in
our
case.
the
district
judge
reviewed
that
and
said,
after
being
instructed
in
instruction
number
36
in
our
case...
and
this
is
something
that
we
tried...
the
chairman
of
exxon
took
the
stand
in
trial
and
gave
the
jury
a
chart
of
all
the
money
that
exxon
had
paid
out
of
its
pocket
and
told
the
jury:
we've
been
deterred
enough,
so
you
shouldn't
award
any
punitive
damages.
and
the
jury,
of
course,
rejected
that
argument
that
exxon
made.
and
the
district
judge
reviewing
that
decision...
and
this
is
around
page
240
to
245
of
the
petition
appendix...
the
district
judge
said:
i
think
the
jury
had
ample
reason
to
do
so.
and
remember
to
the
tune
of
$5
billion.
and
so
why
did
the
district
judge
think
that?
well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
not
when
he
was
reviewing
the
size
of
the
award,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
criminal
case,
the
statement
of
facts
supporting
the
guilty
plea
in
the
criminal
case...
and
remember,
we're
only
talking
about
environment
in
the
criminal
case...
and
in
terms
of
punishment,
the
only
money
for
punishment
in
the
criminal
case
is
$25
million.
all
the
rest
of
the
money
is,
as
the
district
court
said,
to
clean
up
exxon's
mess
or
to
put
money
into
the
environment.
now,
for
$25
million
fine
that
exxon
paid
in
the
criminal
case,
the
district
judge
explained...
or
i'm
sorry,
the
district
judge
approved
the
statement
that
the
u.s.
attorney
submitted,
which
said
the
basis
for
this
is
that
the
captain
and
the
third
mate
were
negligent.
that
was
the
only
thing
even
there.
it
wasn't
until
our
trial
and
our
discovery
that
it
was
brought
out
that
the
complicity
of
the
organization
ran
far
deeper.
and
so
at
our...
phase
three
of
our
trial,
which
was
entirely
about
exxon's
conduct,
not
any
more
at
all
about
captain
hazelwood's
conduct...
in
phase
three
of
our
trial
we
started
out
the
closing
argument
by
saying
here's
the
relevant
evidence
for
the
jury.
and
we
played
something
for
the
jury
called
trial
compilation
9.
now,
that
appears
at
appears
at
page
1295
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
we
actually
submitted
a
videotape
that
we
have
submitted
to
the
clerk's
office,
and
it
is
sitting
in
the
clerk's
office.
there
are
50
segments
in
trial
compilation
9,
and
all
50
deal
with
exxon's
upper
management
receiving
reports
of
hazelwood's
conduct
and
deeming
it
a
gross
error
to
put
him
in
command
and
so
forth,
all
there.
so
it
wasn't
until
the
trial
in
our
case
that
it
came
out
how
deep
the
complicity
ran
in
the
organization
and
how
reprehensible
the
conduct
was.
and
in
reviewing
the
award
the
district
judge
said:
now,
with
that
level
of
complicity
and
reprehensibility,
i
think
the
jury
could
have
decided
that
exxon
should
be
punished
for
this--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--deterrence.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
we
submit
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
district
judge
said
that
this
is
what
he
deemed
a
critical
factor
supporting
the
punitive
award.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
if
you
accept
our
argument
in
the
first
that
to
get
in
the
door,
all
we
had
to
show
was
that
a
managerial
agent
was
reckless
and
that
captain
hazelwood,
as
exxon
conceded,
was
a
managerial
agent.
when
you
are
reviewing
the
size
of
the
award...
and
i
think
we're
talking
about
the
third
question
presented,
the
size
of
the
award...
all
the...
all
the
evidentiary
questions
are
resolved
in
favor
of
us,
and
certainly
they
are
resolved
in
a
way
that
conducting
de
novo
reviews,
a
lower
court
understood
and
told
this
court
what
the
record
was.
and
it
is
all
about
the
three
years
that
they
knew
captain
hazelwood
was
drinking.
but
i
don't
want
to
leave
justice
kennedy's
question
about
deterrence,
because
even
if
this
court
looks
at
the
payments
exxon
has
made
from
a
perspective
of
deterrence,
there
are
two
legs
in
which
exxon
has
clearly
not
been
deterred.
the
first
is
that
exxon's
own
executives
testified
to
congress
shortly
after
the
spill
that
the
results
of
the
spill
were,
quote,
"pretty
much
as
we
envisioned".
now,
it
was
also
common
knowledge
in
the
organization,
and
this
came
out
at
trial,
that
the
idea
of
putting
a
drunken
master
in
charge
of
a
supertanker
was
a
potential
for
disaster
and
incalculably
raised
the
chances
of
a
disaster
and
a
catastrophic
spill
occurring.
knowing
all
this;
knowing
what
could
happen;
knowing
that
the
industry
did
not
have
sufficient
cleanup
equipment
to
contain
a
big
spill;
knowing
that
tens
of
thousands
of
alaskans
that
depended
on
exxon
taking
proactive
action,
the
kind
of
action
that
congress
had
demanded
in
passing
the
tapaa;
exxon
nonetheless
left
captain
hazelwood
in
command
over
a
three
year
span.
so
it
wasn't
deterred
by
knowing
what
would
happen
if
the
tanker
ran
aground.
even
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
having
paid
the
money
out
of
its
pocket,
what
did
it
do?
it
still
hadn't
been
deterred.
in
the
wake
of
the
spill,
and
this
is
part
of
trial
compilation
9,
and
this
was
part
of
the
argument
to
the
jury,
exxon
fired
one
person...
captain
hazelwood.
they
reassigned
the
third
mate.
everybody
else
up...
further
up
the
chain
of
command
who
allowed
this
to
happen
received
bonuses
and
raises.
they
have
taken
no
action
inside
the
company
to
express
in
any
meaningful
way
that
they've
been
deterred
by
what
happened
in
this
incident--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--and
the
amount
of
money
that
they've
had
to
pay.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
by
definition,
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
a
mandatory
punitive
class,
so
this
is
the
one
and
only
time
exxon
will
face
the
respect
of
punitive
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
one
of
the
many
ways
in
which
this
case
is
the
mirror
image
of
the
due
process
cases
that
justice
souter
was
referring
to
that
caused
this
court
to
have
such
great
concern
about
the
uptick
in
punitive
damages,
here
you
have
a
single
case.
you
have
a
single
digit
ratio
which
is
proportionate
to
the
harm
that
was
shown
in
this
case.
you
have...
in
contrast
to
state
farm,
in
the
most
recent...
second
most
recent
case
this
case
had...
in
state
farm
you
had
two
plaintiffs
who
stood
before
this
court
having
received
$500,000
each
in
compensatory
damages
for
the
emotional
distress
of
18
months
of
not
knowing
whether
an
insurance
claim
was
going
to
be
paid.
what
you
have
today
are
32,000
plaintiffs
standing
before
this
court,
each
of
whom
have
received
only
$15,000
for
having
their
lives
and
livelihood
destroyed
and
haven't
received
a
dime
of
emotional
distress
damages.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit.
