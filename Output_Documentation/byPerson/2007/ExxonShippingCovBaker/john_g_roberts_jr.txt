chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
07-219,
exxon
shipping
company
versus
baker,
et
al..
mr.
dellinger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
shipowner
is,
i
suppose,
the
owner
of
exxon
or
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
shareholders,
right?
so
you
have
to
have
a
shareholder
driving
the
boat
before
you
can
assess
liability?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
not
quite
correct
to
say
only
the
owner.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
certain
level
of
employee,
because
corporations
only
act
through
individuals.
it
is
a
certain
level
of
employee
in
the
company.
now,
where
do
you
draw
the
line
between
the
ceo
and
the
cabin
boy?
how
do
you
do
that?
and
i
would
suspect,
just
instinctively,
that
somebody
driving
one
of
these
huge
tankers
is
a
lot
closer
to
the
ceo
than
the
cabin
boy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
only
true
if
you
lose
on
your
second
and
third
questions
as
well,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
answers
to
your
second
and
third
questions
preclude
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
city
of
milwaukee
involved
the
displacement
by
federal
statutory
law
of
federal
common
law.
your
case
involves
the
displacement
of
federal
maritime
law
by
federal
statutory
law.
federal
maritime
law
is
routine.
federal
courts
do
that
all
the
time.
federal
common
law
is
unusual,
and
in
the
city
of
milwaukee
was
resorted
to
simply
by
necessity.
doesn't
that
suggest
that
whatever
the
federal
maritime
rule
on
punitive
damages
is,
it's
a
harder
showing
on
your
part
to
conclude
that
it's
displaced
by
the
statutory
process?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dellinger,
did
you
say
you
had
a
second
and
a
third
point?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
going
to
get
to
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
it's
the
lookout
posted...
i
don't
know
if
they
have
one...
but
the
lookout
posted
in
the
front
of
the
ship,
and
he
is
drunk,
and
doesn't
see
the
reef
or
something?
is
the
corporation
liable
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
regard
the
ship
as
a
business
unit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
different
if
they
say
that
it's...
depending
on
how
they
categorize
the
different
units
tells
whether
they
are
liable
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
a
question
that
i
asked,
not
a
statement.
well,
how
do
you
draw
the
line?
i
mean,
is
the
second
in
command
on
the
boat
a
man
responsible
for
policy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
fisher,
you...
your
friend
says
in
his
reply
brief
that
you
cannot
cite
one
u.s.
maritime
case
that
has
allowed
vicarious
liability
for
punitive
damages.
is
this
the
first
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
your
best
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
take...
take
the
ludlow.
mr.
dellinger
says
that's
a
case
where
the
court
found
that
the
owner
is
not
vicariously
liable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
your
position
of
how
to
look
at
the
case
if
you
have
a
managerial
employee
who
acts
contrary
to
corporate
policy?
is
the
corporation
still
exposed
to
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
a
case
like
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
can
a
corporation
do
to
protect
itself
against
punitive
damages
awards
such
as
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
assume
it
has
a
policy
that
we
will
hire
fit
and
competent
people?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you're
saying...
that's
the
question
i'm
asking.
what
if
there
is
a
breach
of
the
corporate
policy?
i
don't
see
what
more
a
corporation
can
do.
i
mean,
your...
other
than...
other
than
what?
i
mean
it
has
to
say
that
the
policy
is
this,
and
if
somebody
breaks
the
policy,
they're
liable
for
compensatory
damages,
which
can
as
this
case
shows
be
in
the
billions
of
dollars,
and
of
course
the
individual
is
liable
for
punitive
and
other
awards.
but
what
more
can
the
corporation
do
other
than
say
here
is
our
policies?
and
try
to
implement
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
that
level...
at
that
level,
the
president,
i
think
you
would
have
an
argument
that
the
policy
was
being
changed.
it's
not
clear
that
that
argument
works
when
you're
dealing
with
someone
at
mr.
hazelwood's
level.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
that
would
go
to
how
consistently
and
how
effectively
the
policy
is
enforced.
if
the
president
of
the
company
isn't
following
the
policy
it's
not
going
to
be
taken
very
seriously.
that's
different
than
saying
you
have
a
situation
where
on
an
episodic
and
sporadic
basis
a
firm
company
policy
is
breached,
the
individual
is
breaching
the
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
while
ago
you
were
about
to
make
a
point
on
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
was...
i
would
have
thought
that
cuts
heavily
against
you
on
the
third
point.
in
other
words,
if
we're
looking
to
guidance,
you
look
to
federal
law.
and
whether
it's
directly
applicable
or
not,
the
limitation
of
liability
act
reflects
a
very
strong
federal
policy
about
restricting
liability
on
shipowners,
adopted
at
a
time
when
it
was
intended
to
encourage
maritime...
the
maritime
economy.
and
why
isn't
that
something
we
should
look
to,
at
least
under
question
three?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
means
they
don't
get
the
really
quite
extraordinary
protection
that
the
limitation
of
liability
gives.
it
doesn't
mean
that
we
should
ignore
the
reflection
of
that
policy
outside
the
confines
of
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
argument
is
not
that
the
limitation
of
liability
act
should
apply.
it's
that
it
would
be
very
strange
to
say,
where
congress
has
radically
reduced
the
exposure
of
shipowners
in
one
area,
that
we
as
a
matter
of
development
of
federal
common
law,
federal
maritime
law
should
allow
dramatically
expanded
punitive
liability
in
another
area
of
shipowning
liability.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
a
different
jury.
and
the
jury
is
the
one
that
set
the
amount
of
punitive
damages.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
the
same
judge
who
approved
the
instruction
that
said
hazelwood's
negligence
and
recklessness
is
automatically
imputed
to
exxon,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he
was
operating
that
under
understanding
of
the
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
dellinger,
you
have
four
and
a
half
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-219,
exxon
shipping
company
versus
baker.
