mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
exxon
valdez
ran
aground
in
prince
william
sound
on
march
24,
1989,
the
resulting
spill
of
11
million
gallons
of
oil
was
one
of
the
worst
environmental
tragedies
in
u.s.
maritime
history.
the
only
remaining
aspect...
the
only
aspect
of
the
litigation
over
the
valdez
disaster
that
is
before
the
court
today
concerns
almost
entirely
lost
revenues
by
the
commercial
fishing
industry.
exxon
long
ago
paid
$400
million
in
compensation
for
that
lost
revenue.
at
issue
here
is
whether
an
additional
warrant
to
the
commercial
fishing
class
of
$2.5
billion
dollars
in
punitive
damages
is
permissible
under
federal
maritime
law.
the
first
of
the
three
reasons
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
overturning
a
maritime
law
rule
that
has
been
settled
for
200
years.
although
a
shipowner
is,
of
course,
liable
to
fully
compensate
for
all
of
the
damages
caused
by
the
wrongful
acts
of
a
captain
in
compensation,
it
is
liable
for
punitive
damages
under
the
long
settled
rule
only
if
the
shipowner
directed,
ratified,
or
participated
in
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
the
amiable
nancy
is
the
only
maritime
case,
but
this
court
in
lake
shore
in
1893--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
but
this
court's
unanimous
opinion
by
justice
gray
in
lake
shore
cites
with
approval
the
amiable
nancy
decision
and
the
maritime
context.
three
times
this
court
has
considered
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
respondeat
superior
liability
in
punitive
damages
for
the
wrongful
action.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
the
issue
has
been
so
well
settled,
and
courts
of
appeals
have
so
long
recognized,
that
punitive
damages
are
not
available
in
vicarious
liability
in
maritime
cases
that
the
issue,
understandably,
doesn't...
doesn't
come
up.
it's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
in
lake
shore
versus
prentice,
this
court
did
in
1818
and
1893
and
1999
address
this
question,
once
in
the
maritime
context,
once
in
the
context
of
federal
common
law,
and
once
in
the
particular
statutory
context
of--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's...
that's
correct.
but
it...
but
the
rule
is
clear
from
lake
shore
versus
prentice
that
it
is
the
same
rule
as
the
amiable
nancy
rule.
there
is
not
respondeat
superior
liability
in
the
absence
of
some
action
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner.
now,
the
reason--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
the
company
acts
through
its
policymaking
officers
or
through
its
policies;
so
that
if
a
reckless
judgment
is
made
by
someone
who
had
authority
to
set
policy
for
the
company,
either
the
president
of
exxon
shipping...
i
mean
if
the
plaintiffs
were
correct
that
the
jury
actually,
necessarily--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
one
thing
that,
traditionally,
if
you
look
at
all
the
courts
of
appeals
cases
and
all
of
the
tradition
and
maritime
law,
is
that
the
captain
or
the
pilot,
anyone
on
board
the
ship,
does
not
implicate
in
punitive
damages
the
company,
or
the
shipowner.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--or
the
ship
owner.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
the
tradition
is
clear,
justice
kennedy,
that
if
it's
a...
that
the
maritime
tradition
is
that,
while
you
are
liable
for
all
of
the
harms
caused
by
that,
the
decisions
made
on
the
ship
do
not
implicate
in
punitive
damages.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
you
know,
i
can't
rule
out
the
possibility
that
someone
in
that
position
might
be,
but
he
did
not
set
company
policy.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
there
has...
one
has
to
be
someone
with
authority
to
set
relevant
policy
who
has
some
responsibility
over
that
area
of
the
company's
operations
that
would
not--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
there
are
two
responses
to
that
question.
the
first
is
that
there
is...
this
has
worked
in
the
context
of
maritime
law
for
200
years,
and...
and
because
of
the...
there
has
been
a
long
tradition
of
needing
to
foster
and
promote
maritime
commerce,
and
the
fact
that
it's
thought
to
be
particularly
risky
and
dangerous
to
conduct
maritime
commerce.
but--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--there
is
no
question,
justice
souter,
but
that
communications
have...
have
improved.
there
is
a...
there
is
much
of
the
tradition
of
maritime
law
that
still
obtains.
maritime
commerce,
because
it
takes
place
on
the
high
seas,
is
an
inherently
and
continuously
more
risky
endeavor
than
most
other
occupations,
but--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
to
the
extent
that
one
doesn't
see
that
the
tradition
of...
of
what's
worked
in
maritime
law
in
its
own
system
of
law
for
200
years
should
be
different,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
why
the
maritime
law
rule
ought
not
be
the
rule
on
land.
there
are
eight
states--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
and
it
is
the
rule
that
this
court
adopted
in
lake
shore
versus
prentice,
and
it
is...
it
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--and
the
policy
behind
it--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--although
there
are
some
states
that
have
the
restatement
position
that
may
read
"managerial
employee"
in
the
way
that
maritime
law
does,
and
that
is
a
person
who
is
in
a
position
to
set
relevant
policy
for
the
company
and
not
just
the
branch
manager
at
a...
at
a
wal-mart.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
and...
but
my
point
is
not
that...
my
point
is
simply
that
there
are
good
reasons
for
the
maritime
law
rule,
and
they
have
been
accepted
in
other
cases.
when
justice
gray
embraced
that
rule
in
the
lake
shore
case,
he
did
so
because
he
thought
it
inappropriate
to
impose
punitive
elements
on
someone
who
was
not
actually
the
wrongdoer.
and
when
justice
o'connor
wrote
in
kolstad,
she
spoke
of
the
important
principle
underlying
common
law
limitations
on
vicarious
liability
for
punitive
damages.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
was
dealing
with
someone
who
was
at
the
level
of
a
conductor,
i
think,
exactly
on
par
with
the
captain.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
now,
i
think--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--for
punitive
damages.
of
course,
they
are
bound
to
pay
for
all
of
the
harm
caused.
but
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
for
two
reasons:
one,
he
was
unable
to
set
policy
for
any
of
these
issues.
and
think
of
the
larger
context.
the
reason
we
want
to
hold
someone,
an
entity
or
a
person,
liable
in
punitive
damages
is
because
they
make
a
decision
that
is
malicious
or
profit
seeking,
or
whatever.
when
you
are
advancing
the
policies
of
the
company
and
are
empowered
to
advance
those
policies,
and
you
do
so
in
a
way
that
is
either
malicious
or
driven
by
profit
motives
or
hope
to
conceal
it,
when
all
of
those
things
happen,
it
is
appropriate
to
visit
upon
those
persons
the
extra
punishment
of
punitive
damages.
and
that's
why
it's
not
the
importance
of
the
job.
it's
the
fact
that
when
someone
acts
contrary
to
the
interest...
contrary
to
the
interest
of
a
company
and
its
shareholders,
why
in
that
instance
should
someone
who
is
not
advancing
the
company's
interests,
not
authorized
to
make
policy,
do
so?
so
if
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
not
against
the
company
that
owned
the
ship.
only
if
someone--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the...
only
if
the
company
at
a
policymaking
level
is
implicated
would
the
company--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--oh,
well,
i
think
if
the
case
arises
in
a
maritime
context,
there
would
not
be...
there
would
not
be
a
different
rule,
whether
a
decision
was
made
on
shore
or
not.
if
you
are
talking
about
a
maritime
law
case--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
unless
the
decision
was
made
by
someone
at
a
policymaking
level.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
that's
the
implementation
of...
that's
the
implementation
of
a
policy.
so
i
think
what...
if
you
keep
in
mind
the
purposes
of
punitive
damages,
as
to
whether
conduct
should
be
deterred
and
whether
it
should
be
punished,
and
when
you
are
talking
about
going
against
the
shareholders
of
the
company,
not...
of
course,
they
have
to
pay
for
all
the
compensatory
harms.
we
don't
doubt
that.
but
for
punishment
the
notion
is
that
it
is
the...
that...
that
at
least
eight
states
have
and
it
is
in
the
maritime
law
rule
that
you
need
to
show
that
there
is...
that
there
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
absolutely.
we
have
not
disputed
the
fact
that
if
the
jury
actually
did
have
to
conclude
that
exxon
was
reckless
in
the
supervision
or
the
hiring
or
the
placement
of
hazelwood,
that
that
would
be
a
grounds
for
imputing
punitive
damages
liability.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
level
at
which
the...
at
which
the
hiring
decision
was
made.
it
has
to
be
a
decision...
and
i
think
the
way
the
case
was
tried
it
makes
sense
that
if
senior
officials
for
exxon
were
informed
and
if
the
jury
decided
on
the
basis
that
at
a
high
level
at
exxon
shipping
that
they
knew
that
this
person
was...
should
not
be
put
in
command
of
a
ship,
and,
nonetheless,
it
did
so,
that
would
implicate
them.
if
i
could--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes,
and
i
want
to
be
clear
about
that.
the
answer
to
that
question
is:
yes,
the
jury
could
have
found
that
exxon
was
reckless
in
allowing
hazelwood
to
command
the
ship
and
that
that
recklessness
would
implicate
the
company
for
punitive
damages.
but
they
need
not
have
done
so.
they
need
not
even
have
reached
the
issue,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said...
it
is
at
page
88
and
89.
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
jury
could
also,
in
the
alternative,
have
found
that
exxon
followed
a
reasonable
policy
of
fostering
reporting
and
treatment
by
alcohol
abusers,
knew
that
hazelwood
had
obtained
treatment,
and
did
not
know
that
he
was
taking
command
of
the
ship
drunk.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
and
that's
actually
a
recent--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
only
place
it
would
remain
is
in
statutory
settings
where
the
court
has
to
supply
the
answer
to
a
question
of
whether
punitive
damages
are
an
available
remedy
in
a
title
vii
case.
and
that's...
that's
the
only--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
the...
of
course,
with
the...
with
the
replacement
of
the
arrowsmith
versus
tyson
by
erie
against
thompkins,
it
was
no
longer
a
broad
area.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
in
the
lower
courts
the
rule
has
continued
as
a
maritime
law
rule.
it
has
worked
within
the
context
of
a
maritime
law
rule.
maritime
is
its
own
system
of
law.
the
fact
that
west
virginia...
west
virginia
has
a
different
law
than
this
court's
maritime
law--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
is
in
the
absence
of
a...
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
rule,
but
here
the...
there
are...
there's
not
uniformity
among
the
states.
to
turn
to
the
second
question
of
whether...
which
would
actually
preclude
the
need
even
to
resolve
the
amiable
nancy
issue
as
to
whether
there
should
be
as
a
matter
of
judge
made
maritime
law
a
punitive
damages
remedy
for
unintentional
oil
spills.
now,
the
starting
point
to
think
about
that,
i
believe,
is
this
court's
decision
in
milwaukee
versus
illinois
in
1981.
this
is
the
standard
the
court
set:
federal
courts
create
common
law
only
as
a
necessary
expedient
when
problems
requiring
federal
answers
are
not
addressed
by
federal
statutory
law.
that
precisely
describes
this
case.
the
court
looking
out--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
the
reason
i
think
that's
not...
not
the
case
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
the
era
in
which
this
court
created
lots
of
admiralty
law
has
receded
itself
because
congress
has
become
active,
and
then
there's
no
longer
a...
as
necessary,
a
role
for
this
court.
justice
o'connor,
for
example,
said
that
in...
that
we
sail...
the
courts
sail...
now
sail
in
occupied
waters
in
making
maritime
law
because
of
the
amount
of
federal
statutory
law.
and,
secondly,
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
well
developed
punitive
damages
remedy
in
maritime
law,
and
that
we
have
a
harder
road
to
show
that
the
existence
of
a
series
of
federal
statutes
eliminates
the
need
for
that,
is
just
not
established.
this
court
itself
has
never
affirmed
an
award
of
punitive
damages
under
maritime
law.
it
has
never
held
that
punitive
damages
are
available
for
unintentional
conduct
in
maritime
law.
it
has
never
held
that
they
were
available
for
oil
spills.
there
were
only
four
cases
of
federal
maritime
punitive
damage
awards
in
the
history
of
the
country
before
the
clean
water
act
was
passed.
professor
robinson
finds
eight
more
cases
that
don't
use
the
term
12.
we
think
the
answer
is
four.
so
that...
and,
in
fact,
the
largest
award
ever...
ever
made
was
for
$500,000.
so
there
was
no...
and
that
was
after
the
clean
water
act.
so
there's
no
established
tradition
of...
of
punitive
damages.
this
court
would
be
making
a
major
step
to
affirm
an
award,
to
play
a
role,
in
an
unintentional
case
of
punitive
damages
in
maritime
law
for
oil
spills.
because
what
congress
has
done
here
is
to
obviate
the
need
for
a
remedy
by
passing
a
comprehensive
and
carefully
calibrated
statute.
but
the
hallmark
of
the
clean
water
act
is
the
obvious
effort
to
balance--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
that
sort
of
concern
has
much
more
force
if
you
are
talking
about
issues
that
go
to
the
substantiality
of
the
evidence.
but
here
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--right.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
motion
was
made
before
the
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that...
the
motion
was
not
on...
on...
the
court
of
appeals
held...
not
only
did
the
court
of
appeals
press...
not
only
was
the
issue
pressed
and
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
assuming
that
it
was
waived.
the
district
court
was
told
by
the
plaintiffs
that
this
was
the
same
motion--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
was
under
rule
59,
under
rule
49.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i'm
sorry.
it
was
a
rule
50...
it
was
a
rule
50
motion.
it
was
not
untimely,
and
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
there
are
several
answers
to
the
waiver
question.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
the
authority
to
based
upon
it
because
the
court
appeal
based
upon
it.
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
said
that
as
the...
the
plaintiffs
had
told
the
judge,
that
motion,
he
need
not
rule
on
because
it
is
the
same
motion
that
the...
that
had
been
made
earlier.
now
the
earlier
motion
was
based
upon
the
tapaa
act,
as...
that
it
features
it
as
a
reason
why
the
court
need
not
create
or
recognize
a
punitive
damages
remedy.
the
second
motion--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
would
be
the
case
if
we
hadn't
raised
it
all.
we
raised
it
both
times,
the
court
said
it
was
the
same
motion.
here's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
exxon
clearly
and
consistently
argued
statutory
preemption
as
one
of
the
theories--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
but
the
essential
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
same,
and
if
the
issue
were
not
raised...
even
if
the
issue
had
not
been
raised
at
all
in
the
trial
court,
even
if
the
had
not
been
put
before
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
still
could
have
agreed
to
hear
the
question
of
whether
a
punitive
damages
remedy
is
obviated
by
the
panoply
of
federal
statutes
that
are
out
there.
that...
that
there
is...
there
was
an
exercise
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
decision
is
now
the
law
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
court
has
full
authority
to
review
it,
because
as
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
the...
even
professor
miller
recognizes
that
this
is
not
jurisdictional
and
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
do
it,
the
power
to
hear
this
case.
and
it
is
before
it.
and...
and
even
if
the
matter
had
not
been
raised
in
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
had
authority
to
consider
it.
and
there's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
oh,
uh...
yes,
indeed.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the...
the
clean
water
act,
the
reason
it's
an
important
issue,
is
that
the
one
thing
that
congress
has
not
done,
whether
it's
in
tapaa,
in
the
clean
water
act
or
the
oil
pollution
act,
is
they
have
not
provided
for
punitive
damages
but
moreover,
they
have
never
had
any
remedy
that
is
uncalibrated,
that
is
limitless,
that
is
not
carefully
measured
so
that
it
respects
the
need
to
protect
the
interests
to
be
protective
by
those
laws,
by
the
interest
in
clean
water,
with
a
decision
not
to
overdeter.
the
problem
with
having
a
punitive
damages
remedy
in
an
area
where
punitive
damages
has
played
no
significant
role,
that
is
judge
made,
is
that
it
simply
obliterates
the
balance
that
congress
has
struck.
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--even
on
civil
fines,
even
on
other
aspects
of
it,
there
is...
there
is
a
careful
calibration.
and
once
congress
has
decided
that
the
limits
of
liability
are
twice
the
measurable
pecuniary
loss,
to
add
to
that
careful
set
of
remedies
that
congress
has
adopted
another
remedy
that
is
however
many
billions
of
dollars
the
jury
might
choose
totally
unsettled
the
scheme
when
congress
has
addressed
the
very
issue.
when
you
ask
the
question:
are
punitive
damages
available
for
oil
spills,
and
you
look
at
the
clean
water
act,
which
covers
so
much
of
the
territory
of
this
act,
it
is
hard
to
make
out
the
case
that...
that
there's
a
need
for
a
judicially
created
remedy,
particularly
when
the
judicially
created
remedy,
unlike
something
that
was
done
by
congress
comes
without
caps,
without
structure,
without
guidance.
if
congress
were
to
decide
that
a
punitive
damages
remedy,
it's
likely
that
they
would
place
some
kind
of
structural
limits
or
caps
on
it
and
not
have
this
limitless,
free
floating--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no.
that's
a...
i
think
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--even
if
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i'm
sorry.
you
have
a
question?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
i
think
surely
that's
right.
and
the...
your
question
recognizes,
as
have
individual
justices,
that...
that
here
you
are
like
a
state
court
in
the
sense
that,
as
justice
scalia
said,
state
courts
have
ample
authority
to
eliminate
unfairness
and
to
set
their
own
rules
in
this
area,
as
you
do
here.
now,
the
first--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
a
double--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
but
you
would
look
to
what
the
criminal
penalty
is
that's
actually
imposed.
the
court
has
said
civil
fines
are
a
better
guide.
and
the
civil
fine,
the
maximum
civil
fine
here
for
both
the
state
of
alaska
and
the
united
states,
would
be
$80
million.
if
you
look
to
what
the
responsible
law
enforcement
authorities
and
public
officials
of
both
the
united
states
and
alaska
thought
was
the
proper
amount,
they
imposed
a
criminal
fine
of
$150
million,
which
was
reduced
to
$25
million
because
of
the
cleanup
efforts
and
the
fact
that
exxon
prepaid
$300
million
of
the
losses
in
advance.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
there
was...
first
of
all,
it
would
be
different
to
look
at
potential
harm
if
the
potential
harm
were
attempted
by
the
defendant,
and
the
defendant
had
been
unable
to
carry
out
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
planned
harm.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
was
not
even
the
basis
of
liability
that
was
put
before
the
jury.
and
if
you...
and...
nor
was
it
shown
that
that...
that
that
would
have
caused
harm.
what...
what
you
really
have
here
is
you...
the
first
thing
you
would
start
with,
justice
kennedy,
is
to
ask
whether
it
is
necessary
for
punishment
and
deterrence.
and
when
you
start
with
payments
that
have
reached
$3.4
billion
in
terms
of
compensation,
fines,
remediation,
restitution,
that
clearly
obviates
the
need
for
deterrence.
and
if
you
look
to...
if
you
look
to
punishment...
if
you
look
to
punishment,
here
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
this
was
not
an
intentional
act.
it
was
not
malicious.
the
company
did
not
stand
to
make
one
dollar
of
profit.
there
was
no
effort
to
enhance
the
profits
of
the
company,
nor
was
there
any
possibility
of
concealment.
and
what
the...
what
the
plaintiffs
put
before
this
court,
the
respondents
in
this
case,
are
a
number
of
issues
that
were
never
put
before
the
jury,
not
part
of
the
case,
by
people
who
were
not
even
plaintiffs;
matters
that
were
outside
of
the
record
and
contrary
to
the
instructions.
so
that
the
jury
was
told
compensation--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
formulate
some
kind
of
rule.
the
best
guide
is
to
look,
i
think,
at
civil
penalties,
which
gets
to...
to
$80
million,
but
to
look
to
what
the
court
said
in
your
opinion
in
state
farm,
where...
where
compensatories
are
so
substantial
it
may
eliminate
any
need
for
additional
punitive
damages
remedy.
there's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
two
responses:
first
of
all,
the
$150
million
penalty
did...
the
purpose
of
the
clean
water
act
also
includes
protection
of
property.
so
it's
not
just
for
the
environment.
and,
indeed,
part
of
the
reason
for
cutting
the
$150
million
award
was
the
compensation
that
had
been
paid.
but,
secondly,
if
you--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--right.
it...
even
if
you
took
that
as
calibrated
to
the
environmental
damage,
the
environmental
damage
was
twice
what
the
compensation...
the
total
compensation
paid
was
$500
million.
the
company
paid
nearly
a
billion
dollars
for
natural
resources
harm.
if
$150
million
was
the
right
amount
for
the
environmental
damage,
then
the
right
amount
for
the
half
of
that
that
constitutes
the
lost
wages
would
be
$75
million,
which
is
itself
close
to
the
$80
million.
but
here
i
think
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
plaintiffs
to
show
why
you
need
deterrence
when
there
was
no
profit
motive,
and
you've
had
to
pay
$3.4
million.
and
when
if
you
look
to
punishment,
that
can't
be
a
black
hole
into
which
all
the
limits
on
punitive
damages
disappear.
it's
whether
that...
if
this
court
can't
set
standards
that
would
limit
an
award
of
this
kind,
that
is
a
reason
for
believing
that
this
ought
to
be
done
by
congress
if
there
are
going
to
be
punitive
damages.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--keep
in--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--keep
in
mind
that
the
largest
award
in
the
history
of
punitive
damages
was
an
award
for
500,000.
that
was
1/14--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i...
i
say
that
this...
that
the
amount
is
enough
to
deter
anybody
for
anything
when
it
is
$3.4
billion.
and
it's
hard
to
know
how
you
could
have
a
punitive
rationale
for
something
which
was
unintentional,
not
designed
to
make
a
profit,
and
could
not
have
been
concealed.
thank
you.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
let
me
begin
by
noting
that
it's...
i
do
not
think
the
court
will
find
in
the
record
that
exxon
said
this
was
expected
and
approved
the...
you
can
look
at
that
excerpt
on
the
dvd
and
see
for
yourself
what
was...
what
was
meant
by
that.
with
respect,
it
is
difficult
to
decide
what
level
of
employee
should
implicate
a
company;
but
it
is
divisible
i
think,
as
justice
kennedy
suggested.
it
is
based
on
whether
that
employee
has
authority
over
the
policy,
and
even
a
ship
captain
may
have
authority
over
some
policies;
he
did
not
hear.
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
was
that
exxon
was
liable...
could
be
liable
for
2.5
billion,
simply
because
against
its
policies,
hazelwood
left
the
deck.
that's
all
that
we
need
to
be
found.
now
with
respect
to
the...
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
punitive
damages
here,
where
you
are...
punitive
damages
cases
generally
look
to
for
the
need
to
deter
the
activity
where
someone
acts
out
of
malice
and
hostility,
intending
to
harm,
which
is
not
true
here;
or
when
a
corporation
acts
out
of
a
profit
motive
and
hopes
perhaps
it
will
be
concealed
or
that
it
will
make
enough
money
off
of
it.
that
is
not
true
here.
exxon
gains
nothing
by
what
went
wrong
in
this
case,
and
paid
dearly
for
it.
in
the
criminal
case,
the
u.s.
and
alaska
agreed
that
the
amount
of
the
penalty
was
quote,
"sufficient
to
provide
punishment
and
deterrence
for
the
conduct
in
question.
"
now
if
you
talk
about
the...
the
amount
where
you
have
that
kind
of
deterrent,
for
an
unintentional
act
that...
of
the
amount
that's
already
paid,
i
heard
no
response
to
what
one
would
say
to
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
state
farm
as
an
outer,
outer
limit.
in
state
farm
the
court
said
where
compensatory
damages
are
substantial,
then
perhaps...
this
is
the
constitutional
context...
perhaps
an
amount
equal
to
compensatories
would
be
the
most.
what
was
substantial
there
was
1
million
dollars.
the
compensatories
here
were
400
or
500
times
the...
what
the
ninth
circuit
found...
504
million
dollars.
yes?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
from
the
stand...
first
of
all,
from
the
stand
point
of
a
company
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
pay
one
person
500
million
dollars
or
a
lot
of
people
500
million
dollars,
in
terms
of
punishment
and
deterrence.
but
also
it
is
the
case
that...
that
with
regard
to
the
first
plaintiff
who
had
been
fully
compensated,
the
argument
would
have
been
that
in
light
of
all
that
happened,
there
is
no
need
for
punishment
and
deterrence
even
in
the
first
case,
and
certainly
cumulatively,
when
the
amount
ad
reached,
say
the
amount
of
the
civil
fines
of
80
million,
one
would
have
said
no
more
punitives,
because
the
purpose
of
punitive
damages
is
a
public
purpose.
it
is
not
to
compensate
the
individual.
here
we're
at
500
times
what
was
considered
substantial
in
state
farm.
i
don't
see...
and
what
is
that...
that
part
of
state
farm
is
to
be
considered
a
dead
letter,
how
one
could
not
see
that
this
is
the
case.
but
that...
that
amount
of
compensatories
is
an
outer
limit,
because
if
you
look
to
what
the
civil
penalties
would
be
that
responsible
officials
have
obtained,
it
is
80.2
million
dollars;
and
when
you
look
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
case
where,
as
justice
breyer
notes,
with
the
first
circuit
opinion,
outside
the
fishing
context
there
would
have
been
no
compensatories
paid
at
all,
or
owing,
because
it's
consequential
damages
and
in
most
states,
the
great
majority
of
the
states,
that
is
not
even
a
compensable...
a
compensable
injury.
but
it
is
a
special
rule
for...
for
fishing.
so
these
are
awards...
that
would
not
have
been
done
in
any
case.
this
was
a
tragic
and
terrible
event,
and
one
for
which
the
company
has
paid
dearly,
and
the...
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
question
will
be
whether
this
court
without
any
guidance
should
assume
that
there
should
a
punitive
damages
remedy
in
areas
where
congress
has
already
acted,
and
whether,
if
so,
the
plaintiffs
have
made
out
any
case
of
an
additional
need
for
punishment
and
deterrence
beyond
what
public
authorities
have
agreed
to.
