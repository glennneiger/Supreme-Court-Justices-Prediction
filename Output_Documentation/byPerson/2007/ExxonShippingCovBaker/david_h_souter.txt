justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
that
be?
i
mean,
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule?
let's
assume...
i
mean
i'll
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
amiable
nancy
does
not
settle
the
issue
absolutely.
why,
then,
should
the...
and
it
doesn't,
it
seems
to
me,
settle
this
distinction
at
all.
so
why
should
there
be
a
distinction
between
corporations
generally
and
maritime
corporations?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
isn't
part
of
the
reason,
at
least
for
the
assumption
that
there's
a
distinction,
something
that
i
think
was
mentioned
in
the
amiable
nancy?
and
that
is
in
those
days,
when
a
ship
put
to
sea,
the
ship
was
sort
of
a
floating
world
by
itself.
and
the...
the
contact
with
the
shipowner
was
simply
gone
until
the
thing
came
back
into
port
again.
that
is
certainly
not
the
case
today,
and
we
know
it's
not
the
case
in
the
circumstances
here.
so
if
the...
if
the
relationship
to
the
corporation,
to
the
ceo,
if
you
will,
and
the
captain
of
a
vessel
is
not
in
any
way
different
from
the
relationship
of
the
ceo
and,
say,
a
division
chief
of
a
corporation,
i
don't
see
why
that
distinction
should
hold
today.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be
an
argument
for
no
punitive
damages,
but
i
don't
see
why
it's
an
argument
for
distinguishing
between
maritime
corporations
and
others.
i
mean,
other...
other
kinds
of
enterprises
have
a
lot
of
risk
in
them,
too.
and
i'm
missing
the
distinction
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
right,
and
i
want
to
make...
let
me
just
make
clear
one
other
point.
you
are
drawing
a
distinction,
as
i
understood
you
to
say
to
justice
ginsburg,
between
the
restatement
position
and
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
your
civil
penalty
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
problem
with
the
civil
penalty
argument
is...
that
the
civil
penalties
were
calibrated
for
environmental
damage,
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
individual
economic
damage?
so
we've
got
an
apples
and
oranges
comparison,
haven't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
to
the...
for
lost
trade
or
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
fisher,
the
problem
i
have...
maybe
it
isn't
a
problem
i
have,
but
a
question
that
that
argument
raises
is
this:
we
know
something
now
that
justice
story
did
not
know,
and
that
is
we've
had
an
awful
lot
more
experience
with
punitive
damages
practice.
and
we've
spent
the
last
decade
or
so
of
this
court
dealing
with
the
problem
of
how
to
set
constitutional
limits
for
awards
which
sort
of
by
most
people's
standards
verged
on
the
excessive.
the
problem
that
we've
had...
we've
had
two
problems
in
coming
up
with
those
constitutional
standards:
one
is
we
can't
simply
substitute
ourselves
as
lawmakers
for
the
state.
we're
talking
about
constitutional
limits,
not
optimum
standards.
and
number
two,
given
those
limits
on
us,
we
have
not
been
able
to
come
up
with
anything
that
could
be
called
determinant
standards.
we've
never,
for
example,
found
a
sufficient
reason
constitutionally
to
put
an
absolute
ratio
kind
of
limit
on
it.
but
here,
as
you
were
pointing
out
earlier,
we're
sitting
as
a
kind
of
common
law
court.
we
are
in
the
position
of
the
states
here.
why
shouldn't
we
recognize
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
deal
with
indeterminate
limits
which
we've
proven
in
the
constitutional
context
and
say,
therefore,
we've
simply
got
to
come
up
with
a
number,
because
no
other
way
is
going
to
give
us
any
kind
of
an
administrable
standard;
and
our
number...
and
i'm
not
saying
this
should
be
it...
but
our
number
is
going
to
be
double
the
compensatory
damages?
that's
the
limit.
would
that
be
an
illegitimate
thing
for
us
to
do
or
an
unwise
thing
for
us
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1989,
the
--
the
supertanker
exxon
valdez
ran
a
ground
off
the
alaskan
coast
spilling
11
million
gallons
of
crude
oil
into
prince
william
sound.
the
spill
happened
after
its
captain,
joseph
hazelwood,
had
apparently
been
drinking
that
night
and
he
was
an
individual
with
the
history
of
alcohol
abuse
and
gave
up
the
helm
at
a
critical
moment,
leaving
a
tricky
course
correction
to
unlicensed
subordinates.
exxon
paid
more
than
$2
billion
in
clean
up
costs
and
over
$1
billion
more
and
penalties
for
environmental
damage.
this
case
is
about
not
the
environmental
effects
of
the
spill,
but
the
economic
loss
it
sustained
by
respondents,
baker
and
others,
commercial
fishermen
and
additional
groups
who
depend
on,
depended
at
least
on
prince
william
sound
for
their
livelihood.
they
sued
captain
hazelwood
in
the
exxon
petitioners,
seeking
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
under
instructions
providing
that
a
corporation
is
liable
for
the
reckless
acts
of
its
managerial
employees,
the
jury
found
that
hazelwood
and
exxon
had
been
reckless
thus
opening
them
to
punitive
liability.
after
awarding
substantial
compensatory
damages,
the
jury
imposed
$5000
in
punitive
damages
against
hazelwood
and
$5
billion
against
exxon.
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
the
jury
instruction
on
corporate
liability
and
ultimately
remitted
the
punitive
judgment
against
exxon
to
$2.5
billion
on
the
strength
of
our
due
process
guide
both
for
punitive
damages.
exxon
sought
certiorari
arguing
that
it
should
not
face
punitive
liability
for
hazelwood's
reckless
acts
that
the
remedies
of
the
clean
water
act
preempt
punitive
damages
for
oil
spills
and
that
in
any
case,
the
$2.5
billion
punitive
award
was
too
large
as
a
matter
of
maritime
common
law.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
are
equally
divided
on
the
corporate
liability
question
and
thus
leave
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
undisturbed
in
this
respect,
noting
that
our
ruling
is
of
course
not
precedencial.
we
also
conclude
that
the
clean
water
act's
remedies
to
damage
to
waters,
shorelines
and
natural
resources
have
no
bearing
on
and
thus,
do
not
preempt
these
plaintiff's
claims
for
economic
loss.
but
while
exxon
maybe
subject
to
punitive
liability,
we
conclude
that
the
$2.5
billion
award
in
this
case
is
excessive
as
a
matter
of
maritime
common
law.
in
reviewing
a
maritime
award,
we
sit
not
in
our
usual
position
reviewing
a
state
law
award
for
constitutionality,
but
in
the
same
position
as
the
state
supreme
court
reviewing
a
state
law
award.
in
doing
so,
we
are
mindful
of
data
showing
that
although
the
median
ratio
of
punitive
compensatory
damages
hovers
around
one
to
one,
the
punitive
award
in
any
given
case
is
unpredictable.
the
prospect
of
eccentric
punishment
carries
an
implication
of
unfairness
in
odds
with
the
nature
of
a
punitive
remedy.
as
congress
and
the
states
have
recognized
in
the
criminal
context,
a
penalty
should
be
reasonably
predictable
and
consistent
so
that
even
justice
holmes's
“bad
man”
can
look
ahead
with
some
ability
to
know
the
stakes
when
he
takes
action
or
fails
to
measure
up.
this
concern
convinces
us
that
some
limitation
is
necessary
and
in
considering
the
appropriate
standard,
we
come
back
to
the
median
ratio
of
about
one
to
one.
the
medians
suggest
that
in
a
well-functioning
system,
awards
at
or
below
the
compensatory
award
would
express
jury's
sense
of
reasonable
punishment
in
cases
like
this
one
with
no
earmarks
of
exceptional
blame
worthiness
such
as
intentional,
malicious
or
profit-seeking
conduct.
we
thus
conclude
that
a
punitive
to
compensatory
ratio
of
one
to
one
is
a
fair
upper
limit
in
such
maritime
cases.
in
this
case,
the
district
court's
calculation
of
the
relevant
compensatory
damages
at
$507.5
million
with
a
ratio
of
one
to
one
yields
maximum
punitive
damages
in
that
amount.
we
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
remit
the
punitive
award
accordingly.
justice
scalia
has

opinion
