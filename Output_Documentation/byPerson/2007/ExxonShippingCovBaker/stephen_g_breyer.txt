justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
get...
looking
at
this
case
of
lake
shore,
as
i
read...
as
i
read
that
case,
i'm
thinking
that
they
looked
back
to
the
admiralty
case,
but
they're
saying
this
isn't
an
admiralty
rule.
it's
a
federal
rule.
and
the
federal
rule
is
that
to
make
the
corporation
liable
for
punitives
in
the
absence
of
bad
conduct
by
anyone
in
the
corporation
but
for
the
lower
executive,
you
can't
do
it.
but
if
it
were
a
higher
executive,
the
president
and
general
manager
or,
in
his
absence,
the
vice
president
in
his
place,
then
you
could.
so
they
are
distinguishing
among
levels
of
corporate
officials.
now
that
seems
to
be
the
federal
rule,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
happens
to
that
federal
rule?
one
thing
we
know
happened
to
it
is
that
time
passed;
erie
v.
thompkins
came
along;
and
most
of
the
relevant
cases
left
the
federal
courts
or
federal
law
and
were
decided
under
state
law.
was
there
anything
left
in
the
federal
system
besides
admiralty
where
this
federal
rule
might
apply;
and,
if
so,
what
happened
to
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what's
happened?
and
the
reason
i
think
i'd
like
to
know
is
because
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
a
difference
from
the
point
of
view
of
stare
decisis
whether
the
federal
rule,
as
federal
rule,
has
always
stayed
the
same
or
the
federal
rule
has
eroded
so
that
in
place
x
and
y
it
disappears,
remaining
only
in
admirality,
in
which
case
you
have
a
genuine
outlier.
and
i
don't
know
what
the
history
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
that's
beside
the
point
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the...
i
mean,
the
obvious
kind
of
thing
would
to
be
say
that
the
standard
would
depend
upon
the
reprehensibility
of
the
conduct
of
the
officer
of
the
corporation,
including
the
captain,
if
you
lost
on
that.
and
where
we
said
roughly
before
zero
to
10...
and
you
are
quite
right
that
this
is
a
huge
amount
of
money...
you'd
say
zero
to
five,
up
to
five
times.
i
mean
that
would
be
rough
and
ready.
but
the
idea
would
be
to
impose
enormous
deterrence
upon
large
firms
involved
in
your
industry
that
you
are
representing
not
to
make
certain
the
officers
on
the
ship
behave
in
a
reprehensible
way.
it's
crude,
but
i
mean
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
we
said
in
the
due
process
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
wouldn't
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
wouldn't
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
going
to
say...
you're
going
to
hear
in
two
seconds...
they're
going
to
say
this
is
the
company
that
makes
the
most
amazing
profit,
et
cetera.
and
so
you're
trying
to
deter
them.
so
we
know
what,
you
know...
so,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that's
why
i'm
interested
in
the
same
question
i
asked
on
the
other
side.
as
i
read
lake
shore,
it
seemed
to
me
my
first
reading
of
it
that
it
picked
up
this
distinction
that
justice
story
made,
and
it
said
quite
right,
you
could
impute
punitives
or
exemplary
damages
to
a
corporation
where
its
managerial
official
is
the
one
who
causes...
who
behaves
recklessly.
but
wait,
we
don't
mean
quite
that.
we
mean
some
managerial
officials.
and
they
seem
to
refer
in
the
admiralty
case,
i'll
tell
you
one
who
he
isn't,
namely,
the
ship's
captain.
he's
not
in
that
category.
and
then
in
this
other
case,
they
say...
they
talk
about
a
superintending
agent
authorized
to
imply,
employ,
and
discharge
the
conductor.
and
they
give
that
as
an
example
of
a
managerial
official
where
there
would
not
be
exemplary
damages
assessed
against
the
corporation
in
light
of
his
conduct.
so
when
i
read
that,
i
thought
that
this
lake
shore
case
is
just
picking
up
the
earlier
case;
and
that's
the
federal
law.
and
you've
given
the
examples
where
the
state
law
has
changed;
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
right.
you
read
the
cases
very
well.
but
is
there
an
example
where
i
could
say
that
the
federal
law
has
changed,
too?
and
you
started
down
that
track,
but
the
reason
this
is
of
probably
more
than
inordinate
concern
to
me
is
that
i
wrote
the
case
in
sand,
i
wrote
a
dissent
in
legion,
i
looked
into
stare
decisis
law
and
made
fairly
clear
views
of
what
it
is.
so
what
would
you
say
to
someone
who
has
accepted
certain
legal
principles
that
we
have
had
in
prior
cases?
and
you
want
to
say
nonetheless
you
win.
okay.
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
it
differs
from
sand,
for
example,
where
they
are
like
two
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
differs
from
sand?
you
say
it
is
not...
i'm
interested
in
your
last
remark.
in
the
sand
ways
i
found...
you
know
we
went
through
it,
public
policy
was
on
the
other
side.
but...
but
we
had
several
cases,
it
wasn't
a
thousand;
it
was
more
like
two;
and
the
supreme
court
had
said
in
two
cases,
one
very
clearly,
you
know...
you
see
the
point
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
say
there
is
no
stare
decisis
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
wouldn't...
you
might
win
on
that
one.
i
mean
if
you
show
that.
they
have...
we
have
to
assume
that
that
isn't
so,
don't
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
purposes
of
this
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay,
that's
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
second
and
third,
this
is
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--some
time
available.
i
would
like
you
to
address
at
some
point
at
your
convenience
what
should
the
standards
be
if,
in
fact,
the
captain
of
a
ship,
or
responsible
for
conditions,
for
example,
negligence
or
recklessness
is
now
going
to
be
not
only
imputed
to
the
corporation
but
subject
for
punitives.
now,
what
i'm
interested
in,
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is:
this
is
a
very
dramatic
accident.
it
involves
oil
spills,
and
they
cause
a
enormous
amount
of
trouble.
but
there
are
accidents
every
day,
and
ships
are
filled
with
accidents
like
automobiles
in
other
places.
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
things
that
go
wrong.
and
if,
in
fact,
it
has
not
been
normal
in
admiralty
until
now
to
assess
punitives
against
the
corporation
on
the
basis
of
the
activity
of,
say,
the
ship's
master,
failures
of
responsibility,
then
it
will
be
a
new
world
for
the
shipping
industry
and
for
those
who
work
on
the
ships.
what
happens
when
a
sailor
slips
and
is
hurt,
and
it's
very
serious
to
that
sailor,
et
cetera?
what
principles
do
you
have
to
suggest,
if
any,
for
creating
a
fair
system
that
isn't
just
arbitrary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
what's
even
the
theory
of
that?
because
the
theory
of
punitives
is
that
the
individual
who's
receiving
the
money
wasn't
hurt
one
penny's
worth?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
really
the
money
ought
to
go
to
the
people
generally
in
the
state
or
it
ought
to
go
to
other
people,
rather
than
those
people
who
have
already
been
compensated.
that's
the
theory
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
exhibits
the
difficulty
for
me
of
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
relevance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
relevance
of
the
leg
that
we're
assuming
exxon,
other
than
the
captain,
did
bad
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
seem
to
be
now
talking
about
the
evidence
that
they
did
bad
things.
but
that's
the
leg
that
they
did--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
doesn't
that
show,
then,
that
there
had
to
be
a
finding
that
they
did
the
bad
thing?
