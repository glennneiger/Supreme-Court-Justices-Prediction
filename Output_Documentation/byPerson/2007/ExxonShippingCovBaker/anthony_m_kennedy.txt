justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
the
captain--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
not
a
managerial
officer
for
any
purpose?
suppose
he
decides
that
he's
going
to
leave
despite
an
adverse
weather
report?
is
he
not
a
managerial
agent
at
least
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
asking
about
the
concept
of
the
managerial
officer
in
general.
and
i
think
that
we
can
explore
in
this
argument,
whether
or
not
the
amiable
nancy
held
very
squarely
about
punitive
damages,
whether
we
ought
to
do
so
in
the
first
instance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
a
large
part
of
that
inquiry
turns
on
what
a
managerial
officer
is
and
what...
was
hazelwood
not
a
managerial
officer
for
any
purpose
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
don't
think
the
conductor
is
on
a
par
with
a
captain.
the
captain
has
this
huge
vessel.
he
can
decide
when
it
leaves.
he
decides
the
course.
and
i
think
that
"managerial
officer"
might
be
a
divisible
concept.
obviously,
he
doesn't
bind
exxon
for
filing
its
tax
returns
or
to
decide
whether
there's
a
deduction.
but
you
are
saying
he
binds
exxon
for
no
purpose
at
all,
ever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
we
are
talking
about
punitive
damages
but
at
the
concept
of
a
"managerial
officer".
and
i
haven't
heard
why
he
isn't
a
managerial
officer
at
least
as
to
some
things.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
talking
about
tradition.
it
has
never
been
the
tradition
for
criminal
statutes
to
have
open
ended
penalties.
so
that...
that
explains
why
the
cwa
has
specific
limits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
perhaps
that's
a
segue
to
point
no.
3.
i
don't
wish
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
cut
you
off.
on
point--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--on
point
no.
3--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--my
only
question
is
this:
assume
that
there
will
be
punitive
damages
applicable
to
exxon
under
maritime
law
in
in
case.
we
have
read
in
the
briefs
about
the
limits
that
should
be
imposed
on
these
punitive
damages.
and
those
are
from
our
due
process
cases.
if
we
are
deciding
this
case
as
a
matter
of
our
authority
to
determine
federal
maritime
law,
are
there
factors
that
we
should
include
in
a
punitive
damages
framework
that
do
not...
that
do
not
appear
in
our
due
process
cases?
and,
if
so,
what
are
those
factors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it,
under
that,
you
would
point
to
the
double...
the
provision
for
a
fine
double
the
amount
of
the
damages?
that
would
be
a
factor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
if
we're
looking
for
guidelines--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--double
general
damages
is
a
factor
that
we
could...
that
we
could
follow
in
the
maritime
framework?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
be
the
formulation
of
the
rule
if
the
court
thinks
that
any
added
amount
would
not
deter,
and
how
do
we
know
that?
how
do
you
formulate
this
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
any
of
those
cases
say
the
managerial
agent
is
liable
if
he
violated
express
instructions
from
an
employer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
that's
what
the
last
part
of
your
instruction
33
says.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
captain
may
be
managerial
for
some
purposes
and
not
others.
i
think
that's
the
way
it's
going
to
have
to
come
out.
maybe
not.
but
certainly
he
was
not
entitled
to
set
aside
the
policy
of
exxon
that
you
cannot
navigate
a
vessel
while
intoxicated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
have
not
conceded
the
accuracy
or
correctness
of
instruction
33.
and
that's
because
he
was
not
entitled
to
set
aside
the
policy
on
intoxication.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
your
instruction
says
if
he
was
a
managerial
agent,
his
acts
are
attributable
to
the
corporation.
that's
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
corporation's
responsibility
or
complicity
or
culpability
is
simply
not
relevant
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
even
though
that's
what
you
talk
about
in
your
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
your
theory
of
the
case,
instruction
33,
if
the
superior
had
told
hazelwood
don't
pilot
the
ship
today,
exxon
would
still
be
liable?
that's
your
theory
of
the
case
under
instruction
33?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
the
last
part
of
the
instruction
36,
i
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that...
that
goes
to
measures,
not
to
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
the
first
phase.
and
that's
the
instruction,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you
have
to
explain.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
you've
read
the
case...
our
case
in
cooper,
which
says
that
the
appellate
court
has
to
examine
de
novo
to
determine
the
adequacy
or
the
excessiveness
of
the
award
to
deter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
a
fortiori,
it
gives
us
the
right
and
the
duty
to
do
so
as...
sitting
as
a
common
law
type
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the...
the
united
states
code,
the
general
criminal
code,
18
u.s.c.
3571,
has
exactly
that
number.
it's...
for...
it's
double
the
pecuniary
loss
for
a
criminal
act.
and
it
seems
to
me,
if
when
we're
looking
for
guidance,
as
justice
souter
quite
properly
indicated
we
must,
and
justice
scalia
has
indicated
with
reference
to
the
water
act,
that
this
is...
gives
us
a
very
valuable
instruction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
the
measure
what
is
necessary
to
deter?
isn't
that
what
we've
asked
first
and
foremost,
not
exclusively
perhaps?
