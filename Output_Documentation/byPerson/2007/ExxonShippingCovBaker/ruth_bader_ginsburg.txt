bader

mr.
dellinger,
how
was
that
rule
settled?
you
go
in
that
story
and
the
amiable
nancy,
but
no
one
even
raised
the
question
of
punitive
or
exemplary
damages
in
those
cases.
so
what
is
the
long
settled
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
in
maritime
law
that
you
are
relying
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
on
land
on
the
railroad.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
talking
about
maritime
law,
and
relying
on
the
amiable
nancy.
and
my
only
point
is
that
was
not
raised,
argued,
or
decided.
so
it's
rather,
i
think,
an
exaggeration
to
call
it
a
long
line
of
settled
decisions
in
maritime
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
lake
shore
case,
if
i
remember
right,
did
not
involve
a
managerial
employee.
it
involved
a
conductor
on
a
train.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
you're
talking
about
a
different
level.
i
think
we
ought
to
be
clear
on
this.
i
thought
it
was
conceded
that
hazelwood
was,
indeed,
a
"managerial
agent"
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
restatement
of
torts,
right?
so
you
are
talking
about
it's
not
good
enough
that
you
are
managerial
agent;
you
have
to
be
in
a
higher
echelon
in
the
company.
that's
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
aren't
many
states
that
follow
the
restatement
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right,
mr.
dellinger,
that
in
the
railroad
case
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
concept
of
respondeat
superior?
it
didn't
make
any
distinction
between
regular
employees
and
managerial
employees,
and,
indeed,
it
was
not
dealing
with
a
managerial
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't
recall
that
they
made
anything
about
managerial.
they
were
just
talking
about
respondeat
superior
at
large,
i
thought.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was...
there
was
sufficient
evidence
of
that.
i
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
jury
could
have
found
that
exxon
knew
that
this
captain
had
a
severe
alcohol
problem;
and,
yet,
they
let
him
stay
on
voyage
after
voyage
and
did
nothing
about
it.
so
the
jury
could
have
found:
never
mind
the
captain.
exxon,
itself,
is
a
grave
wrongdoer
because
it
allowed
the
tanker
to
be
operated
by
a
captain
who
was
certainly
not
fit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
a
jury
question.
there
was
evidence
both
ways.
so,
on
this
issue,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
if
you
succeed,
all
you
can
get
is
a
new
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and,
i
take
it,
next
time
around
the
jury
would
get
a
special
verdict
and
be
asked:
was
exxon,
itself,
reckless
in
allowing
this
captain
to
stay
on
the
ship?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr....
mr.
dellinger,
before
we
get
into
the
merits
of
that
issue,
the
clean
water
act
did
not
enter
this
case
until
13
months
after
the
jury
verdict.
and
the
trial
court,
who
had
very
carefully
managed
this
case...
and
it
was
a
humongous
case...
would
never
list
it
as
an
issue
in
the
case.
and
so
he
said:
i
won't
hear
it
13
months
after
the
verdict.
why
shouldn't
we
instruct
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
a
district
judge
does
a
diligent
job
like
that
one
did
to
try
to
get
at
all
the
issues...
says
you're
too
late;
you
can't
come
in
13
months
after
the
verdict
and
argue
a
point
of
law
that
would
have
overtaken
the
verdict,
because
essentially
you're
asking
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
on
this
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
well,
what
did
you
make...
you
made
a
motion
to
bring
up
the
clean
water
act
as
dispositive
on
punitive
damages,
and
you
made
that
motion
13
months
after
the
jury
verdict.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
is
the
basis
in
the
federal
rules
for
that
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
13
months
after
the
verdict.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i...
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is:
under
what
federal
rules
did
you
move
to
bring
up
this
issue
13
months
after
the
verdict?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
49
is
on
special
verdicts.
what
did
this
have
to
do
with
special
verdicts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
rule
50
is
pretty
strict,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
rule
50...
if
you
want
to
use
rule
50,
you
have
to
first
move
before
the
case
goes
to
the
jury.
and
if
the
judge
says
no,
i'll
reserve
it.
then
you
move
again
after
the
jury.
and
if
you
don't,
it's
got
very
tight
timelines.
and
you
are
arguing
to
a
court
that
has
held
that
these
limitations
in
the
federal
rules
must
be
strictly
observed.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
time
limit
in
the
federal
rules
that's
stricter
than
the
rules
that
involve
50(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
didn't
appeal
on
that.
you
raised
it
properly,
you
lost
on
it,
and
you
didn't
appeal
on
tapaa.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
statutory.
but
the
statute
was
tapaa,
and
it
was
not
the
clean
water
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
you
know,
there
were
or
at
least
some
strong
amici
briefs
in
this
case
that
have
asked
this
court,
tell
the
court
of
appeals
that's
no
way
to
operate
vis
a
vis
district
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
looking
at
what
this
court
said
in
txo
was
proper
in
a
punitive
damages
case?
that
is,
this
spill
was
horrendous,
but
it
could
have
been
far
worse.
and
so,
under
txo,
you
look
at
what
was
the...
could
be
the
maximum
damage
that
could
have
been
caused
by
this
occurrence,
and
that
could
be
many
times--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
factor
here.
i
mean,
wasn't
the
example
that
the
captain
was
trying
to
maneuver
the
ship
after
the
disaster
in
such
a
way
that
would
have
made
it
much
worse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
some
confusion,
mr.
fisher,
about
this
kolstad.
i
take
your...
it
has
entered
this
case
at
two
levels.
one
is
this
business
about
the
company
policy;
but
as
far
as
exxon
having
a
policy,
you
don't
mix
alcohol
with
employment
on
a
tanker;
but
kolstad
said
it
has
to
be
a
consistently
enforced
policy.
so
you
don't
have
any
problem
with
kolstad
on
that
issue,
if
you're
using
it
here
for
a
managerial--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was
a
statute
that
was
raised
in
the
district
court.
and
the
district
court
raised
this
tapa
act,
and
they
thought
that
that
was
the
statutory
guide,
and
that
was
the
reason
why
there
should
not
be
punitive
damages,
but...
so
that
was
one
of
the
things
the
court
of
appeals
said
under
the
head
of
waiver.
they're
substituting
one
federal
statute
for
another.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fisher--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
time
is
running
out.
and
this
there's
one
question
i'd
like
you
to
address,
and
that
is
are
there
other
cases
against
exxon
seeking
compensation
and
punitive
damages
based
on
this
oil
spill
that
are
still
awaiting
trial
or
decision?
or
is
this
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
don't
have
the
problem
of
litigant
a
getting
these
punitive
damages
and
than
b,
c
and
d
all
wanting
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
as
a
class,
if
you
take
them
individually,
each
individual,
did
mr.
fisher
say
15,000
something?
