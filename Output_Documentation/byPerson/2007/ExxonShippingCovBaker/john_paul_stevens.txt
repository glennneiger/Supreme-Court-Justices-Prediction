may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
dellinger?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
some
punitive
damages
cases,
the
liability
attaches
because
the
person
has
hired
someone
who
is
obviously
incompetent.
supposing
that
the...
a
crew
member
was...
an
obviously
incompetent
crew
member
was
hired
by
the
captain
of
the
ship.
would
that
be
sufficient
to
justify
punitive
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
was
hired
by
a
shore
based
personnel,
then,
would
that
be
the
difference
for
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
one...
the
company
says
the
captain
hires
the
crew
members
who
could
cause
all
sorts
of
damage.
and
another
company
says
somebody
on
shore
can
do
it.
you
have
a
different
rule
between
those
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
there
be
vicarious
liability
or
not
in
the
case:
negligence
in
hiring
an
incompetent
crew
member?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
has
the
authority
to
decide
who
to
hire.
is
that
policymaking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
recklessness
in
hiring
the
employee
who
caused
the
damage
can
be
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
hiring
the
third
mate
here,
if
he
was
negligently
hired
by
somebody
on
shore,
there
would
be
liability?
but
if
he
was
negligently
hired
by
the
captain,
there
would
be
no
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt.
to
what
extent
is
present
maritime
law
informed
by
state
common
law
throughout
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
throw
this
thought
on
the
table.
if
the
policy
is
made
by
the
board
of
directors,
can
the
president
unilaterally
change
the
policy?
the
chief
seems
to
be
suggesting
he
could?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
we
have
this
problem,
the
president
of
the
company
is
the
same
as
the
vice
president.
