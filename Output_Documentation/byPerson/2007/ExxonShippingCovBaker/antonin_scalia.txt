justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
thought
so
in
prentice.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
had
not
understood
you
to
concede
that...
that
the
land
rule
was
different
from
the
maritime
rule.
i
gather
that
in
many
states
it's
the
same
as
what
you
assert
the
maritime
rule
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
was
a
land
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
one
of
those
factors
is
the
clean
water
act,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
is
not
pre
emptive
as
a
matter
of
law,
it's
one
of
the
factors
that
you
can
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
respect,
i
mean,
the
janitor
has
authority
over
an
aspect
of
the
corporation.
i
mean,
surely,
that
can't
be
the
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
the
test
is
the
person
has
to
be
high
enough
that
it
justifies
holding
the
entire
corporation.
and
i
doubt
whether
a
captain
is...
is
high
enough.
how
many
of
these
units
does
exxon
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
twenty
vessels.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
lake
shore...
well,
i
thought
the
lake
shore
and
amiable
whatever
it
is
principle
was
that
a
captain
ain't
one
of
those.
the
captain
doesn't...
doesn't
do
the
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
that,
and
$3.5
billion.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about...
what
about
looking
to
the
clean
water
act?
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
this
question
about
the
act.
assuming
we
agree
with
you
that...
that
it
was
too
late
to
raise
the
clean
water
act
as
a
separate
pre
emptive
factor
in
the
case,
why
was
it
too
late
in
the
appellate
court
to
raise
the
clean
water
act
as
an
additional
reason
why
maritime
law
should
not
be
interpreted
to
allow
punitive
damages
and,
in
part
3
of
the
case,
as
a
factor,
why
punitive
damages
of
the
amount
at
issue
here
should
not
be
allowed?
it
seems
to
me
there
it's
not
a
new
argument.
it's
just
an
additional
factor
for
arguments
that
have
already
been
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
that's
part
3.
what
about
part
2?
why...
why
can't
the
petitioner
raise
the
argument
or
why
could
not
the
petitioner
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals?
okay,
we
agree
that
the
clean
water
act
does
not
pre
empt
the
granting
of
punitive
damages
here,
but
one
of
the
factors
that
we
ought
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
modern
admiralty
law
in
this
situation
permits
punitive
damages
is
the
existence
of
the
clean
water
act.
that's
not
a
pre
emption
thing.
is
that
also
waived,
do
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
have
to
make
every
tiny
little
argument.
i
mean,
you
can
think
of
additional
points
on
appeal
so
long
as
it's
under
the
same
major
heading.
and
the
major
heading
here
is
not
the
clean
water
act
pre
empts
punitive
damages;
the
major
heading
is,
rather,
modern
admiralty
law
does
not
permit.
and,
you
know,
they
had
made
other
arguments
about
prior
cases;
they
had
talked
about
state
law;
and
this
is
just
another
argument:
by
the
way,
here's
another
one.
there's
the
clean
water
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
close.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
really
say
pre
emption,
and
so
it's...
it's
just
another
factor
to
consider
when
you
decide
what
the
evolving
law
of
admiralty
requires.
