justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
remedy
for
the
finding
of
market
manipulation
the
abrogation
of
the
contract,
which
is
a
separate
process
from,
from
the
revocation
of
market
based
tariff?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
same
reason
may
support
each,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe
i
think
i
led
us
into
this,
mr.
kneedler.
the
situation
that
i
was
positing
was
a
situation
in
which
the
power
marketer
had
engaged
in
market
manipulation
in
the
context
of
which,
at
the
time
of
which,
it
made
this
contract.
and
my
suggestion
to
you,
which
i
think
you
took,
was
that
in
a
situation
like
that
there
would
be
a
basis
for
public
interest
review
and
abrogation
of
this
contract
because
of
the
market
manipulation
in
fact.
and
the
market
manipulation
would
also
be
a
reason
to
say
market
power
had
been
acquired.
it
had
not
been
mitigated,
and
hence,
the
market
based
tariff
authority
would
also
be
revoked.
and
that
was
the,
that
was
the
limit
of
my
question.
and
i
take
it
your
answer
there
is
it
could
do
each
of
those
things?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
guess
this
is
what's
bothering
us.
your
point
does
not
seem,
at
least
to
me,
to
be
a
modest
point,
because
if
i
understand
where
you're
going,
you're
saying
that
in
a
market
with
the
degree
of
volatility
of
this
one
at
the
time
these
contracts
were
made,
no
contract
is
enforceable.
it
will
last
only
so
long
as...
as
one
party
does
not
complain
about
a
disadvantage,
and
the
minute
it
does,
it's
back
in
front
of
ferc.
and
the
argument
is
being
made
that
in
fact
a
market
based
rate
cannot
be
enforced
through
contract
because
the
very
premise...
i.e.,
what
you
call
and
what
was
called
a
competitive...
judge
ginsburg
called
a
competitive
market...
was
absent.
isn't
that
the
consequence
of
what
you're
arguing?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
do
we
know
when
we're
only
in
the
second
worst?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
mean
the
problem
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
don't
see
any...
and
i
realize
that
you're
giving
me
limiting
principles
to
what
seems
to
me
in
effect
a
general
rule
that
says
no
contracts
are
enforceable,
if
they
are
made
during
periods
of
market
volatility,
however
sensible
they
may
be
given
the
premise
of
that
volatility.
and
your
first
proposal
for
a
limiting
principle
is
this
is
the
worst
of
times,
and
i
don't
see
how
that's
going
to
help
because
somebody
is
always
going
to
claim,
well,
these
times
are...
are
almost
as
bad.
justice
david
h.
souter
look--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
a
good...
i
mean
that's
a
fine
general
phrase,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
possible
to
make
an
enforceable
contract
under
these
circumstances?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
haven't
heard
a
limiting
principle
yet.
you
have
three
others.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
these...
did...
did
the
petitioners
here...
do
you
claim
that
the
petitioners
here
were
guilty
of
failure
to
report?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
a
different
issue.
that...
that
may
be
that
the
commission
was
derelict
in...
in
having
a
nonstatutory
condition.
but
did
these...
did
these
petitioners...
do
you
claim,
is
it
a
basis
for
your
claim
before
ferc,
that
these
petitioners
failed
to
follow
the
reporting
requirements
that
were
in
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
here
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand.
you're
saying
one...
one
limiting
principle
is
the
re
examination
of
contract
might
be
limited
or
at
least
only
prompted
by
a...
a
failure
to
follow
reporting
requirements.
i
can
understand
that
and
that
offhand
seems
to
me
perfectly
fair.
it
may
not
cover
this
case,
but
i
can
understand
that.
what
are
your
other
two
reasons?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
that
seems
to
me
consistent
with
the
problem
that
i
have
with
your
argument.
and
that
is,
if
you
make
a
contract
in
a
period
of
high
volatility,
and
it
seems
reasonable
to
the
two
parties
to
come
up
with
a
rate
that
is
certainly
a
higher
rate
than
anybody
would
come
up
with
if
they
were
going
through
cost
plus
return
ratemaking,
the
contract
is
vulnerable.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
commissioner
massey's
argument
is
consistent
with
the
conclusion
that
all
those
contracts
are
vulnerable.
so
i
don't
see
that
as
any
limiting
principle.
what's
your
fourth
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
i
can
understand...
under
your
fourth
point,
i
could
understand
the
position
if
the
argument
were
this
is
above
$74,
and
therefore
it
is
suspect;
but
the
claim
you're
making,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
much
broader
claim.
you're
saying
the
entire
contract
ought
to
be
abrogated
in
the
public
interest,
not
merely
above
74
but
below
74.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
when
you
get
there,
you're
saying
abrogate
this
contract.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying...
have
you
at
any
point
said
reduce
the
rates
to
$74?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
will...
i
will
stop
the
cross
examination,
but
i
just
wanted
to
get
the
four
points.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
were
saying
that
the
most...
the
most
reasonable
thing
for
us
to
do
was
to
enter
into
a
long
term
contract
in
order
to
mitigate
the
effects
of
the
chaotic
spot
market.
you
understood
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wright,
may
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
she
asked
you:
what
do
you
want
ferc
to
do
if
it
does
what
you
want
them
to
do?
and
you
said:
we
want
them
to
make
the
same
kind
of
adjustments
ex
post
that
they
made
to
the
spot
prices.
isn't
there
one
big
difference
here
to...
between
readjusting
spot
prices
and
rewriting
or
abrogating
a
contract
like
this?
in
the
case
of
adjusting
the
spot
prices,
in
effect.
what
they
are
saying
is:
somebody
isn't
going
to
make
the
killing
that
he
thought
he
was
making.
it
was...
a
spot
price
indicates
it
was
a
snap
decision.
people
were
reacting
to...
to
changes
in
the
market
from
hour
to
hour.
and
the
commission
is
going
to
go
back
and
say,
you
know,
you're
out
of
luck
on
the
killing
you
thought
you
made.
when,
on
the
other
hand,
the
commission,
in
effect,
rewrites
or
abrogates
a
contract,
it
is
saying
something
very
different.
it
is
saying:
you
may
not
engage
in
long
term
reliance
on
the
agreements
that
you
make.
and
isn't
that
a
huge
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
with
respect,
doesn't
that,
in
effect,
mean...
going
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg...
that
what
you
really
want
is
to
say
there
wasn't
effective
competition.
there
wasn't
effective
competition
because
the
market
was
chaotic.
and,
therefore,
in
a
chaotic
market,
including
this
one,
a
long
term
contract
which
later
turns
out
to
be
disadvantageous
to
one
side
is
unenforceable.
isn't
that
what
you...
your
real
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean...
that's
where
i
don't
think
that,
at
least
with
me,
helps
your
argument.
we
all
know
that
there
is
a
broad
umbrella
standard
of
justness
and
reasonableness.
one
index
of
justness
is
the
set
of
conditions
under
which
the
parties
operate.
the
conditions
in
this
case
were
conditions
of
chaos.
and
what
the
other
side
is
saying,
i
think,
is:
we
each
tried
to
make
the
most
reasonable
deal
we
could,
the
most
advantageous
for
us
that
we
could,
under
these
conditions
of
chaos.
they
certainly
produced
a
rate
that
wouldn't
have
been
produced
in
a
calm
time
either
by
market
based
tariffs
or
by
cost
plus
return
ratemaking.
but
under
the
circumstances
that
we
did
operate
in,
this
is
what
it
produced.
and
we
were
dealing
at
arm's
length.
nobody
was
engaging
in
fraud,
et
cetera.
so
that's
just.
and
i
think
when
you
say,
as
you
did
a
minute
ago,
there
is
an
overarching
obligation
or
standard
of
justness
and
reasonableness,
i
think
you're
saying
that
that
reasoning
that
i
just
tried
to
outline
is
not
sufficient
reasoning
for
sustaining
the
contract.
now,
if
i'm
wrong,
tell
me.
if
i'm
right,
it
seems
to
me
you're
really
saying
ditch
the
contracts
if
they
were
entered
into
in
a
period
of
high
volatility.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
entitled
to
relief
if
there
was
manipulation,
but
these
people
were
not
engaging
in
the
manipulation?
in
other
words,
they
are,
in
effect,
innocent
of
the
manipulation;
but
they,
as
sellers,
are
in
a
chaotic
market.
are
you
entitled
to
relief
against
them
under
those
circumstances?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
trouble
is
that
justness
is
a
relational
category,
and
you
are...
i
think
you
are
saying
we
don't
have
to
consider
justness
to
the
parties
who
were
doing...
we
will
assume
for
the
sake
of
the
question...
the
best
that
they
could
under
bad
circumstances.
you
are
saying
justness
only
goes
to
the
ultimate
retail
ratepayer.
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
you
really
arguing...
no,
but
aren't
you
really
making
the
argument
that
the
notion
of
justness
does
have
an
equitable
component
that
looks
to
the
source
of
the
trouble;
and
if
the
source
of
the
chaos
in
the
market
are
the
very
people
who
are
trying
to
make
a
profit
on
your
contract,
that
is
a
reason
to
say
that
that
market
based
rate
is
not
a
just
one,
because
they
created
the
conditions
that
gave
them
the
leverage
to
get
you
to
make
the
deal
that
you
made?
but
if
they
are
not
guilty
of
improper
conduct
in
making
it,
then,
you
know,
everybody
has
to
take
his
lumps.
aren't
you
saying
something
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
just
as
a
general
premise,
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
weren't
you
assuming
something
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
and,
to
the
extent
that
you
make
that
argument,
that's
an
answer,
sort
of,
to
the
question
that
i
put
to
you
a
couple
of
times:
why,
why
isn't
your
argument
anything
less
broad
than
the
fact
that
you
can't
make
a
contract
in
a
chaotic
market?
and
you
are,
at
least
as
a
subset
of
what
you
are
saying,
telling
us
that
if
the
contract...
if
the
chaos
in
the
market
was
caused
by
the
impropriety
of
one
contracting
party,
that
party
should
not
profit
from
it.
and
i
understand
that
answer.
that
if...
to
the
extent
that
that
is
your
position,
it
is
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think...
and
here
i
want
to
be
clear
on
this...
you're
saying
they
were
not
just
and
reasonable
on
the
date
they
were
made,
number
one,
if
the
market
manipulation
that
caused
the
chaos
was
manipulation
by
these
petitioners.
that
at
least
is
part
of
your
argument.
but
i
think
you're
also
saying
that
the
rates
were
not
just
and
reasonable
if
they
were
the
result
of
market
manipulation
by
others,
not
these
petitioners.
am
i
correct
that
your
argument
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
second
alternative?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
kneedler,
in
your
rebuttal,
will
you
address
the
state
of
the
record
with
respect
to
evidence
or
findings
about
possible
manipulation
by
these
petitioners?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but,
in
fact,
it
didn't
get
that
articulate.
the
closest
it
came
to
answering
my
question,
i
take
it,
is
at
the
point
to
which
you
referred
me
in
the
joint
appendix,
no
effect
on
these
contracts?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
what
do
you
say
about
the
standard
of
justness?
in
effect,
i
think
you're
saying
it
doesn't
matter
whether
these
particular
petitioners
manipulated
the
market
creating
the
conditions
under
which
these
contracts
were
made
at
a
price
which
turned
out
to
be
much
higher
than
the
spot
price
would
be
later,
it's
irrelevant.
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
talking
about
what
ferc
said.
i'm
talking
about
your
position.
i
think
your
position
is
that
even
if
these
people...
even
if
these
people...
petitioners
manipulated
and
that
created
the...
or
contributing
to
creating
the
market
under
which
these
contracts
were
made,
that
is
irrelevant
in
looking
at
the
contracts--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
not
asking
what
claim
has
been
made.
i
want
to
know...
i
want
to
know
what
the
government's
position
is.
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
position
is
that
manipulation
by
these
petitioners
would
be
irrelevant
to
a
review
under
the
public
interest
standard,
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
best
way
to
read
the
government's
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
here
and
now
in
this
courtroom.
