what
happens
if
that
approval
is
given
and
then
a
seller
enters
into
contracts
and
then
it's
later
discovered
that,
contrary
to
what
ferc
thought
when
it
granted
the
approval,
the
seller
has
exercised
market
power
or
has
otherwise
manipulated
the
market?
is
there
any
remedy
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
among
your
arguments,
and
the
arguments
of
the
respondent,
seems
to
be
in
some
tension...
seems
to
me
in
some
tension
to
ferc's
market
based
rate
program.
do
you...
do
you
acknowledge
that
that
is
permissible
interpretation
of
the
federal
power
act
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it...
isn't
it
a
central
requirement
of
a
market
based
rate
program
that
ferc
cannot,
except
perhaps
in
very
limited
circumstances,
go
back
and
undo
contracts
that
had
been
entered
into
under
that
program,
based
on
a
retrospective
determination
that
the
rates
are
not
just
and
reasonable,
in
the
same
sense
that
<ferc>
[=
ferc]
would
have
applied
that
term
if
the
utility
had
simply
filed
a
tariff?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
even
that
argument
is
much
narrower
than
what
the
ninth
circuit
held,
isn't
it?
the
ninth
circuit
just
referred
to
"dysfunction
in
the
market".
they
didn't
say:
and
dysfunction
means
manipulation
by
anybody.
they
seemed
to
have
included
all
sorts
of
other
things:
the
california
regulatory
program,
the
weather,
and
a
number
of
other
factors.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
didn't
the
alj
find
there
wasn't
manipulation
in
this
market,
the
forward
market?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
ferc
disowned...
did
ferc
reject
the
finding
of
the
alj
as
to
manipulation
of
this--
