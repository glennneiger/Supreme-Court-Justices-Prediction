justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
ferc
thought
it
could
live
with
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
because
the
government
recommended
that
we
deny
cert
in
this
case;
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
kneedler,
this
is
a
decision,
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
that
empowers
ferc.
ferc
says:
oh,
we
don't
have
that
authority.
and
the
ninth
circuit
said:
yes,
you
do.
so
this
is
an
agency
arguing
that
it
can't
do
what
the
ninth
circuit
says
it
can.
and
why
can
it
not?
because
of
two
decisions
of
this
court.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought...
let's
go
back
a
step.
i
thought
ferc's
position
was:
we
could
not
decide
as
a
matter
of
discretion
to
do
this
because
we
are
limited
by
those
supreme
court
decisions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
what
ferc...
ferc
independently
interpreting
the
statute
to
reach
the
conclusion,
which
it
might,
to
reach
the
conclusion
the
ninth
circuit
did.
it's
ferc
saying:
we
can't
do
that
because
we
have
our
marching
orders
from
the
supreme
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
companies
who
were
involved
in
this
case
make
those
reports?
i
mean,
there
was
something
about
during
this
energy
crisis
there
was
rampant
noncompliance
with
the
filing,
with
the
quarterly
report
filing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
i
do
have
one
question.
it
was
the
position
that
ferc
took
in
december
of
2000,
when
it
was
encouraging
the
entrance
into
the
long
term
contracts
rather
than
using
the
spot
market,
and
in
that
order
ferc
said
that
it
would
monitor
long
term
contracts
vigorously
for
rate
reasonableness
and
that
buyers
could
challenge
rates
through
206
proceedings.
what
happened
to
that
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
did
ferc
monitor
the
rates
vigorously
to
make
sure
they
were
reasonable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
those
decisions
are
puzzling
transposed
to
this
setting,
because
in
those
decisions
it
was
the
seller
who
had
made
a
bad
bargain;
the
price
was
too
low;
and
the
seller
wanted
to
get
out,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
now
we
are
transposing
that.
and
one
of
the
main
themes
i
think
of
justice
harlan's
decision
was
this
act
was
meant
to
protect
the
consumer,
to
make
sure
that
the
consumer
wasn't
going
to
be
overcharged.
and
that
runs
through
those
two
1956
decisions,
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
market
based
authority,
or
any
such,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
same
order
where
they
said
we
are
going
to
monitor
the
rates
for
reasonableness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
the
commission
is
on
the
job,
but
one
of
the
pieces
of
information
here
is
that
the
commission
staff
said
that
the
dysfunction
in
the
spot
market
carried
over
into
the
forward
market,
such
that
prices
in
the
forward
market
were
inflated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dellinger,
wasn't
the
staff
saying
something
more
than
that
in
that...
in
that
report?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
commission
didn't...
didn't
respond
to
the
staff
report,
right?
didn't
say
anything
one
way
or
another
about
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
they
say
it
with
respect
to
the
staff
report?
or...
i
thought
they
thought
the
staff
report
was
irrelevant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
would
you...
how
would
you
go
about
determining
in
this
case?
you
said
it's
not
the
traditional
cost
of
service,
return
on
investment.
so
how...
if
you
prevail,
what
should
ferc
do
to
determine
whether
this
rate
was
fair
and
reasonable?
