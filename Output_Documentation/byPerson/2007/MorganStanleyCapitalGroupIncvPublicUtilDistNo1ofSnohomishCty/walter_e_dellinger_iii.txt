mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
stevens,
good
morning,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
ginsburg
began
by
asking
whether
the
ninth
circuit
decision
did
not
in
fact
empower
rather
than
restrict
the
authority
of
the
commission.
the
answer
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
fundamentally
precludes
the
commission
from
carrying
out
what
the
commission
believes
is
essential
to
its
mandate
to
assure
an
abundancy
of
electrical
energy
at
the
lowest
possible
cost.
and
that
is
to
encourage
a
market
based
approach
to
recognize
that
if
you're
going
to
have,
as
the
commission
has
said,
the
kind
of
investment
in
the
building
of
infrastructure
to
produce
energy,
people
are
going
to
have
to
be
able
to
rely
upon
long
term
contracts.
in
this
case,
what
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
did
is
to
take
away
a
very
important
option
that
the
commission
believes
is
essential
in
times
of
market
volatility
and
dysfunction.
and
that
is
the
option
for
parties
to
get
out
of
the
spot
market
and
to
enter
into
a
long
term
contract
of
a
secure
supply.
if
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
stood,
literally
parties,
buyers
and
sellers,
would
both
be
precluded
from
entering
into
that,
because
you
would
know
if
there
were
dysfunction
that
nothing
you
could
say
in
the
contract
could
mean
that
you
could
buy
power
for
the
next
eight
years
at
$105
at
a
time,
as
was
the
case
here,
when
the
spot
market
was
$300.
it
would
take
away
the
option.
and
sellers
would
know
they
couldn't
enter
into
a
contract
they
could
rely
upon
subject
only
to
being
overridden
in
the
public
interest,
which
ferc
does.
and
that
would
be
very
damaging
to
the
very
processes
which
the
commission
has
used
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
of
50
years
ago
to
encourage
development
in
this
industry.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
yes.
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
correct.
that
was
a
case
where
a
seller
was
seeking
to
get
out
of
a
contract
that
was
paying
too
low.
but
the
fundamental
purpose...
the
court
recognized
even
in
justice
harlan's
opinion
that
maintaining
the
stability
and
expectation
of
contracts
was
going
to
be
important
to
consumers,
to
buyers
as
well
as
to
sellers.
in
this...
and
ferc
has
adopted
that
position.
in
this
case
you
have
a
situation
where
the
commission
decided
that
instability
in
the
spot
markets
was
being
partly
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
state
regulatory
process
had
discouraged
people
from
entering
into
longer
term
contracts;
and
ferc
said
in
its
2000
san
diego
order,
we
strongly
urge
utilities
to
move
their
load
to
long
term
contracts
of
two
years
or
more.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
true.
and
when
they
did
indeed
undertake
a
review
of
this,
they
decided
that
with
respect
to
these
contracts
there
was
no
evidence
of
bad
faith.
there
was
no
evidence
of
unfairness.
there
was
no
evidence
of
duress.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
market
manipulation
that
affected
the
contracts
specifically
in
these
long
term
cases.
the
long
term
contracts
were
part
of
the
solution
or
the
mitigation
of
the
problem.
it
was
a
long
term
contract
that
allowed
the
utilities
in
this
case
to
get
out
from
under
$300
a
megawatt
prices
and
to
enter
into
a
contract
at
105,
in
one
of
the
cases.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no;
and
it's
very
important
that
not
be
a
basis,
because
if
that
were
the
case,
parties
would
know
and
parties...
both...
all
parties
were
aware
that
there
was
volatility,
and
the
commission
had
announced
that
the
conditions
were
conducive
to
manipulation
of
the
spot
markets.
that
would
mean
that
a
seller
would
say
to
a
buyer,
we
know
you
would
like
to
get
out
of
this
volatility
and
get
a
regular
supply
guaranteed
at
a...
at
a
much
lower
price
for
long
term.
we
can't
enter
into
that
contract,
because
the
fact
that
we
know
there
has
been
this
problem
in
the
market
means
that
our
contract
won't
be
upheld.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
says
that
contract
terms
are
not
binding
if
they
were
influenced
by
a
dysfunctional
market;
and
that
is
the
very
most
important
circumstance
in
which
having
long
term
contracting
is
most
valuable.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
know
precisely
what
the
ninth
circuit
means
by
dysfunctional.
there
is
volatility.
i
think
the
difference
would
be
is
there
manipulation,
is
one
factor;
there
were
a
number
of
factors
that
caused
the
volatility
here--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct,
unless...
and
this
is
an
important
unless...
the
commission
reviews
those
contract
terms
and
finds
that
the
public
interest
necessitates
a
revision
of
the
contract.
they
have
that
discretion.
they
have
that
authority.
they
are
prepared
to
and
have
exercised
it,
but
in...
in
this
case--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--for
example--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
an
example
that
the
court
gave
in
mobile
and...
and
sierra.
but
the
court...
but
what
the
commission
would
know
is
that
the
circumstances
would
have
to
be
rather
extraordinary.
because
whenever
you
were
to
modify
the
terms
of
a
contract
that
the
sellers
have
been
relying
upon,
the
sellers
became
buyers.
they
also
went
out
on
the
market.
they
are
buying
and
selling.
so
unraveling
all
of
these
buying
and
selling
would
itself
be...
would
be
dysfunctional;
but
what
sellers
would
know
thereafter
is
that
they
couldn't
rely
upon
the
contracts.
they
would
either
have
to
stay
out
of
that
market
or
they
would
have
to
charge
a
risk
premium,
which
would
raise
prices
to
buyers
and
consumers.
so
that
long
run
harm
of
making
it
less
reliable
to
engage
in
contracting
would
have
to
be
overcome
by
a
fairly
severe
showing
of
what
the
short
term
harms
would
be
to
one
particular
set
of
buyers.
the
commission
has
made
those
findings.
they
found
circumstances
where
the
contracts
gave
first
priority
to
commercial
uses
of
power,
and
at
a
time
of
shortage
that
meant
that
residential
customers
would
be
cut
off.
the
commission
ordered
that
done.
the
commission
has
been
on
the
job
here.
they
have...
the
process
by
which
they
grant
market
based
rate
authority
is
an
elaborate
one.
they
get
assurances
that
the
sellers
lack
transmission
market
power,
generation
market
power,
that
there
are
no
barriers
to
entry,
that
if
they
have
transmission
facilities
there
is
open
access.
they...
any
party
can
challenge
that.
and
any
party
in
this
case,
any
party
in
this
case--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
but
what
the
commission
realized
is
that
the
parties
were
aware
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
spot
market.
they
were
able
to
contract
on
that
basis.
they
could
have
asked
for
what's
called
a
memphis
clause,
giving
either
party
the
right
to
seek
modification
based
on
some
administrative
determination
of
what
a
right
price
would
be
at
some
later
point.
they
did
not.
they
kept
in
the
clauses
that
allowed
only
joint
approaches
to
the
commission,
and
indeed
in
one
contract
said
that
the
rates
are
fixed
and
shall
remain
in
effect
for
the
terms
of
this
agreement.
that
language
is
illustrative
of
how
you
could
not
enter
into
a
long
term
contract
and
assure
that
the
terms
were
binding.
the
fact
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--right.
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
dysfunction--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
don't...
i
don't
know
what
you're
intimating,
but
what
the
conclusion
was
of
the
commission
was,
for
example,
that
there
was
no
basis
to
support
a
finding
that
the
respondents
exercised
market--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
the
commission
expressly
said
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
staff
report
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
manipulation.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
the
aspect
of
the
staff
report
that
said
that
forward
prices
were
influenced
by
prices
in
the
spot
market
and
that
there
had
been
dysfunction
was
irrelevant
precisely
because
it
would
have
been
relevant
were
the
commission
making
its
own
bureaucratic
determination
of
a
right
price.
but
the
parties
made
the
determination
of
the
prices
that
they
wanted
to
agree
to,
the
terms
they
wanted
to
agree
to,
and
they
did
so
with
full
knowledge
both
that
they
knew
there
had
been
some
manipulation,
that
there
was
volatility
and
that
they
knew
they
didn't
know,
as
justice
scalia,
said
the
extent
of
it;
and,
therefore,
that's
precisely
why
you
want
to
be
involved
in
a
contract
that
guarantees
you
today
that,
no
matter
what
happens
to
prices
in
the
next
year
or
next
summer,
one
of
these...
one
of
these
utilities
has
a
guarantee
of
power
at
$105.
i
will
reserve
my
time
for
mr.
kneedler,
unless
there
are
questions.
no,
i'm
not.
he
is
going
to
do
a
rebuttal,
whatever
amount
of
time
we
have,
justice
stevens--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--unless
there
are
further
questions.
thank
you.
