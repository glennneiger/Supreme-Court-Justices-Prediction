i'll
repeat
myself.
i
didn't
have
the
mike
on.
the
court
will
hear
argument
in
morgan
stanley
capital
group,
inc.,
against
snohomish
public
utility
district
no.
1,
or
public
district...
snohomish
county
no.
1.
mr.
kneedler.
justice

mr.
dellinger.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
this
question?
assuming
there
is
absolutely
no
bad
faith
or
fraud
or
anything
like
that,
but
there
is
just
a
general
conclusion
that
the
market
was
such...
in
such
turmoil
that
there
could
not
be
made
reasonable
or
long
term
contracts,
because
the
predicate
for
that
kind
of
negotiation
just
didn't
exist.
would
that
be
a
basis
for
setting
aside
the
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dellinger,
does
that
mean
that
it
is
your
position
that
no
matter
how
dysfunctional
the
market
was,
just
complete
turmoil,
as
long
as
the
contract
was
made
in
good
faith
without
any
fraud
or
abuse
of
power,
it's
a
binding
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
puzzled
by
your
answer
to
justice
scalia.
if,
say,
it
is
something
like
an
atom
bomb
or
terrorism
or
something
totally
innocent,
where
the
parties
are...
but
it
causes
the
same
economic
consequence,
namely:
that
the
rates
are
a
lot
higher
than
they
otherwise
would
be,
why
do
you
draw
the
distinction
that
he
says
doesn't
make
sense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
each
case
the
rates
would
be
higher
than
they
otherwise
would,
and
you'd
have
to
say
they're
high
enough
to
be
no
longer
just
and
reasonable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
infected
by
an
act
of
god,
it
seems
to
me
the
same
consequence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--know
that's
a
premise
in
the
debate.
i
find
it
hard
to
accept.
how
could
the
two
be
totally
separate?
it
was
the
crisis
that
made
it
necessary
to
engage
in
the
long
term
account.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
is
undertaken.
