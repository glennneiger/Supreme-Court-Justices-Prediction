just
so
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
alito's
question,
the
commission
has
retroactive
authority
to
alter
the
permission
to
engage
in
these
contracts
only
if
there
is
fraud--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
something
similar?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
retroactive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
retroactively?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
alito's
question,
i
think
as
i
understood
it,
or
at
least
a
question
in
my
mind
that
followed
upon
it,
was
whether
or
not...
what's
the
basis
for
any
retroactive
revocation
of
that
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
volatile
the
same
as
dysfunctional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
your
theory
prevails
and
you
go
back
to
the
commission,
does
the
morgan
stanley
contract,
where
the
lower
rate
seller
was,
does
that
get
reevaluated,
too?
you
reevaluate
all
the
contracts
back
down
the
line?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
say
that,
consistent
with
your
theory,
that
everybody...
that
this
whole
unwinding
process
backs
up
all
the
way
down
to
the
original
seller?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
could
argue
that
it
should
be
just
the
obverse.
