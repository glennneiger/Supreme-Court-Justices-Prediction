mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
off
by
picking
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
observation
that
ferc
understood
itself
to
be
without
discretion
here,
and
add
the
point
that
this
is
an
extremely
unusual
case
where
ferc
thought
it
lacked
discretion
to
apply
the
statute.
in
the
briefs,
there
is
now
agreement
that
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
applies
to
all
rates
under
the
act
and
couldn't
be
more
clear
that
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
applies.
ferc--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i...
there
is
much
that
we
don't
disagree
with
about
the
market
based
rate
program.
i
suppose
we
do
think
that
there
are
two
things
that
ferc
has
to
make
sure
that
it
does
as
part
of
that
program.
first,
in...
in
approving
the
market
based
rate
program,
judge
douglas
ginsburg
said
when
there
is
a
competitive
market,
ferc
may
rely
upon
market
based
rates
in
lieu
of
cost
of
service
regulations.
that
makes
perfect
sense
to
us,
but
when
there
is
a
competitive
market.
so
we
think
a
critical
part
of
a
market
based
rate
program
is
that
there
must
be
an
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
the
market
was
competitive
when
the
contract
was
entered
into.
of
course,
we
have
the
unusual
circumstance
here
where
professor
kahn
and
nine
other
deregulatory
economists
wrote
a
letter
in
may
2001
saying
markets
are
out
of
control,
this
is
the
unusual
circumstance
where
ferc
should
enter
a
price
cap.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
justice
alito,
all
rates
must
be
just
and
reasonable.
we
are
not
arguing
that
ferc
needs
to
go
back
to
a
cost
of
service
ratemaking
approach;
but
an
agency
that
sees
just
and
reasonable
and
thinks
it's
applying
a
just
and
reasonable
standard,
for
70
years
has
thought
it's
either
going
to
do
a
cost
of
service
approach,
or
more
recently
it's
going
to
rely
on
the
market
to
make
rates
just
and
reasonable,
our
modest
point
is
that
it
can't
ignore
the
market.
it--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
let
me
make
four
points
here,
though,
that
i
think
make
absolutely
clear
that
it
would
not
set
a
broad
precedent
to
revisit
the
contracts
here.
and
the
four
points
are
first,
the
government
acknowledges
in
its
brief
at
page
16,
this
was
the
worst
electricity
market
crisis
in
history.
second--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no,
no--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
your
honor,
of
course
the
federal
power
act
instructs
a
federal
agency
to
ensure
that
rates
are
just
and
reasonable.
a...
the
federal
power
act--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
ferc,
ferc
needs
to
grapple
with
this.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
have
three
others.
there
was
rampant
noncompliance
with
the
reporting
requirements.
the
government
concedes
that,
too:
ferc's
market
based
rate
program,
however
well
it
might
work
today
after
it's
been
improved,
as
the
government
said
in
its
opposition
to
cert,
however
well
it's
been
improved
on
account
of
the
2005
amendments--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
they...
they
were
not...
they
were
not
complying
with
the...
we
contend
that
the
reporting
requirements
that
were
in
effect
in
2001
were
inconsistent
with
the
statute
and
not--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--our...
our
basic
argument
is
the
rates
weren't
just
and
reasonable--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--and
the
rates
weren't
just
and
reasonable
on
the
day
the
contracts
were
signed.
and
let
me
make
clear--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--my
third
is,
as
commissioner
massey
stated
in
his
dissent,
without
contradiction
by
the
majority,
that
if
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
were...
would
be
applied,
these
rates
would
be
declared
unlawful,
because
they
were
multiples
of
traditional
prices.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
fourth
one
is,
as
justice
ginsburg
has
noted,
that
ferc
said
in
december
2000,
before
all
of
the
contracts
at
issue
were
negotiated,
that
it
would
monitor
and...
and
would...
deems
rates
above
$74
suspect.
all
the
contracts
in
here
have
rates
above
that
benchmark.
so
it's
the
worst
crisis
in
history;
there's
rampant
noncompliance;
rates
were
multiples
of
traditional
pricings,
and
ferc
had
said
it
was
going
to
study
these
rates
closely.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
we
want
this
case
to
be
sent
back
to
ferc.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
are
saying
reduce
the
rates,
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i'm
sure
different...
there
are
many
different
parties
on
my
side.
i'm
sure
we
have
many
different
theories.
could
i
tell
you
what
ferc
's
done
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
appreciate
the
cross
examination.
it's
helped
me
get
out
what
i
think
our
four
points--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
i...
does
morgan
stanley's...
well,
morgan
stanley
actually...
a
number
of
parties
in
morgan
stanley's
situation
chose
to
file
protective
actions,
and
morgan
stanley
didn't.
so
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
waived
its
rights
or
not.
but
i
think
ferc
ought
to
grapple
with
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
right.
well,
your
honor,
the
way
these
markets
work,
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
morgan
stanley
doesn't
have
the
sort
of
claim
that
they
have
suggested
without
telling
us
they
have.
and,
of
course,
they
know
what
their
portfolio
is.
there
is
every
reason
to
think
they
bought
power
before
the
big
spike
came,
and
that
they
bought
power
since
then,
and
that
they're
not...
they're
not
buying
power
at
104
and
selling
it
to
snohomish
at
105,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we're
not,
your
honor,
but
i
would
remind
you
this
is
a
plain
language
case.
the
statute
requires
rates
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
that...
for
70
years,
that's
meant
something
to
administrative
agencies.
the
reason--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--thank
you,
your
honor.
we
expect
that,
ultimately,
it
will
do,
or
should
do,
what
it's
done
with
respect
to
the
spot
market.
with
respect
to
the
spot
market,
it
has
provided
relief
to
parties
who
bought
at
the
same
time.
and
what
it
has
done
is
it
has...
it
has
determined
what
it
calls
a
mitigated
market
clearing
price.
it
has
done
this
with
great
elaborate...
elaboration
for
periods
as
low
as
10
minutes
for
the
period
in
2000...
2001,
when
it
is
now
conceded
manipulation
raised
rates
on
the
spot
market.
and
it
has
taken
the
prices
that
were
paid,
and
it
has...
it
has
reduced
them
to
what
it
calls
the
"mitigated
market
clearing
price".
this
is...
this
is
described
in
painful
detail
in
the...
in
the
ninth
circuit's
2006
cpuc
versus
ferc
opinion.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
your
honor,
we
had
a
sort
of
a
henry
ford
choice.
any...
we
had
a
choice
of
a
variety
of
rates
as
long
as
they
were
unjust
and
unreasonable.
we
didn't
have
any
alternative,
because
of
the
market
manipulation,
that
allowed
us
to
get
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
on
the
spot
market,
on
long
term
markets--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--in
large
part,
because
ferc
had
told
us
they
were
going
to
monitor
these
contracts
and
use
the
$74
benchmark.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
we
have
to
prove
these
were
just
and
reasonable
on
the
day
they
were
entered.
and
the
way
these
markets
work,
local
utilities
like
snohomish
buy
energy,
and
they
always
sell
a
little
bit.
they're
going
to
lose
153
million
over
the
life
of
this
contract.
and
it's
always
been
the
life
of
the
contract
that
ferc
has
thought
was
the...
the
real
benchmark.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
your
honor,
we
think
that
ferc
could,
and
it
seems
clear
that
it
will,
distinguish
between
the
spot
market
and
long
term
contracts
on
these
bases.
our
point
there
is
that
we
probably,
if
it
does,
then
have
to
overcome
a
hurdle
and
show
that
there
wasn't
effective
competition
at
the
time
the
long
term
contracts
were
entered
into.
ferc
might
rationally,
once
it
grapples
with
this,
decide
that
that's
the
way
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
applies.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
your
honor,
again,
i
don't
think
we
should
prevail,
and
it's
not
our
position
that
we
prevail,
unless
we
show
that
we
didn't
have
just
and
reasonable
alternatives
at
the
time
we
entered
into
the
contract.
we
don't
think
we
can--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
make
clear
what...
what
we
mean
by
"chaos"
or
"high
volatility".
we
think
we
have
to
show
that
manipulation
was
affecting
the
market.
we
don't...
we
don't
think
we
are
entitled
to
relief
if
it
was
the
weather
that
was
affecting
the
market.
ferc's
2003
staff--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we...
we
don't
think
that
a
statute
that
protects
consumers
and
says
that
consumers
get
just
and
reasonable
rates
was
enacted
to
prevent...
to
overcome
contracts
only
when
there
is
fraud
in
the
contract.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
again,
your
honor,
we
don't
need
the
statute.
the
statute
is
superfluous
insofar
as
it
affects
contracts,
and
that
is
its
main
effect,
if
it
requires
fraud
in
the
negotiation
of
the
contract.
and,
again,
if
morgan
stanley
can
show
that
it
was
a
victim
of
manipulation,
too,
then
it
is
entitled
to
relief.
there
has
certainly
been
some
of
that
with
respect
to
some
of
these
spot
market
deals
where
there
are
occasionally
intervening
parties.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it...
on
the
equities,
if
the
local
utilities
end
up
bearing
the
brunt
of
making
bad
judgments
about
the
weather,
that's
one
thing.
it's
quite
another
thing
if
there
is
rampant
non
compliance,
hiding
the
fact
that
there's
been
massive
withholding
of
energy,
and
driving...
and
these
spikes
were
not
accidental,
by
any
means.
that
seems
to
us
to
be,
you
know,
a...
a
sort
of
distinction
that
the...
that
the
law
draws
all
the
time.
and
let
me
say
the
example
came--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
i
guess
the
ultimate
distinction
is
that
there
isn't
somebody
making
a
whole
lot
of
money
on
account
of
market
manipulation
somewhere.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
"just
and
reasonable",
again,
has
always...
has
traditionally
first
meant
a
sort
of
cost
of
service
inquiry
and
more
recently
means
a
market
inquiry.
but,
again,
a
market
inquiry
doesn't...
means
a
competitive
market,
an
effective
market,
as
professor
kahn
said,
not
a
market
totally
infected
by
manipulation.
and
then,
in
any
case--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
guess
consumers
bear
the
brunt
of
acts
of
god,
but
don't...
shouldn't
bear
the
brunt
of
market
manipulation
that
was
unlawful
and
now
is--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
don't
know
because
ferc
hasn't
looked
at
it,
what...
who
morgan
stanley
paid
and
what
they
paid
and
who
made
the
money
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
certainly
think
that
the
best
result
would
be
that
whoever
was
manipulating
the
market
ought
to
be
the
one
who
ends
up
getting
their
return
cut;
and
that
the
local
utilities
and
any
innocent
middlemen
should
be
made
whole,
too.
that's
fine.
it
was
brought
up
earlier
in
discussing
the
market
based
rate
program
sort
of
what
sorts
of
remedies
were
allowed.
and
let
me
say
that...
well,
i
think
this
came
out,
but
the
enron
example
shows
very
well.
enron
got
market
based
rate
authority
in
1993.
enron
was
not
the
only
player,
but
was
a
leading
player
in
the
market
manipulation
in
2000-2001.
ferc
didn't
get
around
to
lifting
their
market
based
rate
authority
until
2003,
and
they
did
it
strictly
prospectively.
it
is
a
core
point
of
our
argument
today
that
that
shouldn't
be
allowed.
and
i
think
the
answer
was:
well,
market
based
rate
authority
only
results
in
lifting
the
market
based
rate
authority;
a
206
action
under
the
federal
power
act
is
where
consumers
get
relief.
that's
right,
and
we're
here
to
get
relief,
and
we
think
that
ultimately
the
parties
that
manipulated
the
market
and
made
too
much
money
on
account
of
the
manipulation
ought
to...
ought
to
lose
what
they
paid;
and,
certainly,
the
ratepayers
shouldn't
bear
the
costs;
and
if
there
are
innocent
middlemen
they
shouldn't
bear
the
cost,
either.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
your
honor.
and
let
me
remind
the
court
that
one
case
that
the
other
side
i
don't
think
has
acknowledged
sufficiently
is
this
court's
1974
texaco
decision.
that
was
a
situation
where
ferc...
well,
the
federal
power
commission
attempted...
attempted
to
do
what
the
other
side
is
asking
this
court
to
rule
today,
to
essentially
make
contracts
sacrosanct
and
not
subject
to
any
challenge.
ferc
had
told
small
producers
that
it
wouldn't...
that
they
could
enter
into
contracts
and
they
didn't
have
to
file
the
contracts,
and
the
commission
wouldn't
review
the
contracts
to
see
if
they
were
just
and
reasonable.
this
court
very
clearly
held,
quote,
"the
commission
lacks
authority
to
place
exclusive
reliance
on
market
prices.
"
unquote.
under
this
statute,
which
requires
just
and
reasonable
rates,
there
must
be
coexistence
between
contracts
and
a
regulatory
backstop.
and,
again,
in
the
situation
here
that
you
helped
me
review...
the
worst
electricity
market
crisis
in
history,
rampant
non
compliance,
rates
that
were
multiples
of
traditional
levels,
and
couldn't
be
justified
under
anything
ferc
has
ever
called
a
just
and
reasonable
standard,
and
ferc
had
said
it
was
going
to
examine
a
benchmark...
this
is
a
case
that
ferc
has
to
go
back
and
explain
why,
at
least
explain
why
it
thinks
these
rates
are
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
on
the
day
they
were
made.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and
we
think
they
weren't,
because
they
were
the
product
of
market
manipulation
that
made
all
of
the
rates
available--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
made
all
rates
unjust
and
unreasonable
on
that
date,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
your
honor,
we
certainly
agree
that
the
test
can't
be
dysfunction;
that
ferc
has
to
grapple
with
this
issue
and
give
it
a
concrete
meaning.
i'm
sure
there
would
be
disagreement
on
remand
as
to
exactly
what
it
means,
and
there
are
lines
to
be
drawn.
but
ferc
needs
to
do
that.
ferc
hasn't
done
that.
ferc
honestly
thought...
again,
this
is
an
unusual
case.
ferc
honestly
thinks
that
the
public
interest
standard,
or
thought
that
the
public
interest
standard,
is
a
completely
different
animal
than
the
just
and
reasonable
standard.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
are
relying
on
both,
your
honor.
we
are...
our...
our
main
argument
is
that
all
rates
in
the
west
at
this
period
of
time--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--were
the
result
of
manipulation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and
the
alj
found
that
the
spot
market...
the
alj
found
that
the
spot
market
manipulation
didn't
affect
the
forward
markets.
no
one
agrees
to
that
today.
ferc
has
disowned
it.
morgan
stanley
has
disowned
it.
i'm
told
that
the
alj
has
disowned
it.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
ferc
said
it
was
irrelevant.
that
was
the
part
of
ferc's
first
order,
where
it
said
it
is
irrelevant
whether
the
manipulation
of
the
spot
markets
affected
manipulation
in
the
long
term
markets.
that
would
be
relevant
only
if
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
applies.
of
course,
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
applies.
one
final
point.
one
remarkable
aspect
of
this
case
is
after
ferc
said
that
in
its
initial
order,
morgan
stanley
asked
them
to
reconsider
it,
and
they
said
we
won't
do
that.
thank
you.
