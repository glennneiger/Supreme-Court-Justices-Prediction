justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
it
clear
to
the
government
that
the
ninth
circuit,
which
is
what,
about
10
percent
of
the
country,
was
going
to
continue
this
interpretation
of
the
act,
and
that
was
not
a
matter
of
any
consequence
to
ferc
or
to
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
wait,
wait.
it
didn't
just
say
the
agency
may
do
it.
it
said
the
agency
must
do
it.
i
don't...
i
don't
consider
"must"
to
be
an
empowerment.
i
consider
that
to
be
a
direction.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
be
a
public
interest
finding,
a
finding
that
because
of
the
market
manipulation
by
the
seller
that
affected
this
very
contract,
the
public
interest
demands
that
we
not
hold
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
didn't
say
fraud.
i
said
market
manipulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
i'm
not
entirely
understanding
you.
why
should
the
fact
that
the
seller
later
acquired
market
power
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
the
initial
contract,
when
he
did
not
have
market
power,
was
a
fair
one?
the
contracts
are
already
down
in
black
and
white,
his
later
acquisition
of
market
power
cannot
affect--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand.
but
later
acquisition
of
market
power
would
result
in
a
cancellation
of
the
permission
for
this
particular
firm
to
enter
into
contracts
for
the
future,
but
i
don't
see
why
it
would
affect
the
past
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
example--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
example,
if
the
prices
down
the
road
turn
out
to
be
so
high
for
the
utility,
that
the
utility
would
go
out
of
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
that
statement
means,
anyway.
the
current
dysfunction
carries
over
into...
into
the
future
market?
what
does
that
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
mean
that
because
of
the
current
dysfunction,
you
can't
predict
for
sure
what
the
rates
are
going
to
be
down
the
road?
of
course
it
means
that.
but
doesn't
a
dysfunction
always
mean
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
isn't
that
why
you
enter
into
long
term
contracts?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
given
the
current
dysfunction
you
have
no
idea
what
the
price
is
going
to
be
down
the
road.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
good
for
them.
[laughter]
i
mean
you're
suggesting
they
should
be
punished
for
that?
i
don't
understand
what...
what
follows?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--didn't
your
clients
know
that
the
market
was
chaotic
at
the
time
they
entered
into
this
long
term
contract?
i
mean
does
this
come
as
a
surprise
that
after
the
fact,
now
that
you're
paying
more
than
the
market
price
is,
you
want
to
kick
over
a
long
term
contract
you
entered
into?
what
has
changed?
did
you
not
know
that
the
market
was
chaotic?
wasn't
that
the
very
reason
you
entered
into
the
long
term
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
you
did
very
well
under
these
contracts.
initially,
you
were
even
reselling
some
of
the
energy
that
you
got.
you
got
it
at
a
price
so
much
below
what
was
then
the
market
that
you
made
a
profit
by
reselling
it.
but
now
that
things
have
changed,
you
don't
like
the
long
term
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wright,
i
really
don't
understand
why
you
would...
why
you
say,
you
know,
if...
if
the
chaos
is
due
to
the
weather
or
maybe,
you
know,
an
arab
oil
embargo
or
whatever,
that
that's
perfectly
okay.
but
if
it's
due
to
manipulation,
it's
bad.
i
can
understand
if
you
added
manipulation
by
one
of
the
parties,
by
the
sellers,
that
i
could
understand.
but
so
long
as
it's
a
factor
extrinsic
to
the
parties
to
the
contract,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
buyer
whether
the
flukishness
of
the
market
is
caused
by
the
weather
or
by
manipulation
by
somebody
other
than
the
seller?
in
other
words,
i
think
it's
not
enough
to
show
manipulation.
that's
what's
going
on
in
the
market.
and
you're
trying
to
save
yourself
from
it.
so
long
as
it's
not
manipulation
by
the
seller,
i
don't
see
how
you
have
a...
i
don't
know...
an
equitable
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
and
reasonable
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
day
they
were
agreed
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
just
and
reasonable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
are
relying
on
the
narrowest
ground
that
justice
souter
mentioned,
namely,
manipulation
by
the
seller,
wasn't
it
incumbent
on
you
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
manipulation
by
the
seller?
has
that
been...
has
that
been
established?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
of
manipulation
by
somebody.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask,
i
am
sure
you
understand
that
a
finding
that
there
was
no
manipulations
that
affected
these
contracts
is
not
the
same
as
a
finding
that
there
was
no
manipulation
by
these
sellers
in
the
market.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
is
no
such
finding
that
there
was
no
manipulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
is
no
finding
that
there
was
by
these
sellers.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
consolidated
cases
come
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
like
most
cases
involving
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
(ferc),
they
are
very
complicated.
they
concern
the
interaction
between
an
old
administrative
law
doctrine
and
a
new
regulatory
regime.
the
old
administrative
law
doctrine
is
called
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine.
under
the
federal
power
act,
companies
that
sell
electricity
at
wholesale
to
purchasers
such
as
state
and
local
public
utilities,
must
file
a
tariff
with
the
--
with
ferc,
setting
out
the
rates
that
they
will
charge
to
buyers,
generally.
and
the
commission
determines
whether
those
rates
are,
to
use
the
statutory
term,
“just
and
reasonable”.
traditionally,
in
reviewing
these
rates,
ferc
ensured
that
wholesalers
receive
a
fair
rate
of
return
on
their
investment,
but
no
more.
aside
from
tariffs,
the
federal
power
act
also
permits
wholesalers
to
set
rates
with
individual
purchasers
through
bilateral
contracts.
so,
a
wholesaler
and
a
purchasing
public
utility
may
agree
by
contract
to
a
rate
different
from
what
the
wholesaler
charges
other
purchasers
under
its
tariff,
and
can
lock
that
rate
in
for
a
period
of
time.
those
contracts
must
be
filed
with
ferc
before
they
go
into
effect.
under
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine,
the
name
comes
from
two
of
the
cases
in
this
court
in
1956,
under
that
doctrine,
ferc
must
presume
that
these
rates
set
by
freely
negotiated
contracts
between
sophisticated
wholesalers
and
public
utilities,
are
just
and
reasonable.
the
premise
being,
that
these
sophisticated
parties
can
be
expected
to
negotiate
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
only
where
the
rate
seriously
harms
the
public
interest,
may
ferc
and
must
ferc,
set
it
aside.
so,
that's
the
old
administrative
law
doctrine.
the
new
regulatory
regime
is
a
recent
ferc
innovation
called
market-based
tariffs.
a
market-based
tariff
does
not
set
out
rates
like
traditional
tariffs.
rather,
it
allows
the
seller
to
enter
into
freely
negotiated
contracts
with
buyers
in
the
energy
market.
to
qualify
for
a
market-based
tariff,
a
seller
of
electricity,
a
wholesaler,
must
show
that
it
does
not
have
excessive
market
power.
the
key
aspect
of
the
market-based
tariff,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
is
that
the
contracts
entered
into
under
them
do
not
have
to
be
filed
with
ferc
before
they
go
into
effect.
instead,
the
wholesaler
periodically
reports
to
ferc
after
the
fact,
all
contracts
that
it
entered
into.
ferc
believes
that
the
federal
power
act's
requirement
that
all
rates
be
filed
first
with
the
commission
is
satisfied
by
the
filing
of
the
market-based
tariff
itself.
in
these
cases,
respondents
are
western
utilities
that
entered
into
long-term
contracts
with
petitioner
wholesalers
that
had
market-based
tariffs
on
file
with
ferc.
the
contracts
set
rates
that
were
very
high,
by
historical
standards,
because
at
the
time,
short-term
prices
in
the
western
united
states
had
spiked
to
very
high
levels
due
to
a
variety
of
economic,
natural
and
regulatory
factors.
after
that
period
of
high
prices
had
passed,
the
respondents
here,
having
buyers'
remorse,
asked
ferc
to
modify
the
contracts.
but
ferc
refused
after
determining
under
mobile-sierra
that
the
public
interest
was
not
seriously
harmed.
respondents
petitioned
to
the
ninth
circuit
which
granted
the
petitions
for
review
and
remanded
to
ferc
on
two
alternative
grounds.
first,
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
because
contracts
entered
into
under
market-based
tariffs
are
never
initially
filed
with
the
commission,
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
mobile-sierra
presumption
of
validity,
a
presumption
that
their
rates
are
just
and
reasonable.
in
other
words,
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
the
mobile-sierra
presumption
does
not
apply
to
ferc's
first
review
of
a
contract.
second,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
even
if
the
mobile-sierra
presumption
did
apply,
the
standard
for
a
challenge
by
a
purchaser,
the
utilities
here,
is
lower
than
the
standard
for
a
seller's
challenge,
namely,
for
the
buyer,
the
standard
is
merely
whether
the
contract
causes
consumer
rates
to
exceed
a
zone
of
reasonableness.
so
far
are
you
with
me,
right?
[laughter]
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
conclude
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
on
both
counts,
but
that
ferc
committed
other
errors
in
applying
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
decision
below
on
alternative
grounds.
why
was
the
ninth
circuit
wrong?
first,
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine
does
not
apply
only
where
ferc
has
had
an
initial
opportunity
to
review
the
contract
without
the
presumption.
rather,
it
defines
how
the
statutory
just
and
reasonable
standard
applies
in
the
contract
--
in
the
context
of
contracts,
no
matter
when
they
are
challenged.
second,
the
standard
for
a
purchase
whose
challenge
is
the
same
generally
speaking
is
the
standard
for
a
seller's
challenge.
the
contract
to
be
invalidated
must
seriously
harm
the
public
interest.
over
the
last
50
years,
this
court,
lower
courts
and
the
commission
have
understood
the
standard
to
be
a
high
one.
we
have
described
it
for
instance
as,
“unequivocal
public
necessity”.
ferc,
thus,
was
correct
both
to
apply
the
mobile-sierra
standard
and
to
treat
the
standard
as
a
high
one.
nevertheless,
we
find
two
defects
in
ferc's
analysis.
first,
it
is
unclear
whether
ferc
examined
the
impact
of
the
contracts
on
the
consuming
public,
in
light
of
the
rates
consumers
could
have
obtained,
today,
in
the
absence
of
the
contracts.
it
seems
that
ferc
may
have
simply
looked
to
whether
the
contracts
increased
consumer
rates
immediately
upon
going
into
effect
at
the
time
when
all
of
the
prices
were
spiked.
second,
respondents
allege
that
the
petitioners
engaged
in
unlawful
market
manipulation
in
the
spot
market
that
affected
the
long-term
contracts
at
issue
here.
ferc
dismissed
this
allegation
as
irrelevant
because
the
contract
rates
were
not
so
high
as
to
violate
the
public
interest,
but
we
conclude
that
if
a
party
engaged
in
unlawful
market
activity
that
had
an
impact
on
the
contract,
the
contract
is
not
entitled
to
mobile-sierra
presumption
because
it
cannot
be
said
to
be
the
product
of
arm's
length
negotiations.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
neither
--
neither
the
chief
justice
nor
justice
breyer
took
any
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
