mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
in
this
case
reasonably
denied
respondent's
request
to
modify
the
wholesale
contracts
that
the
purchasing
power
companies
had
entered
into
in
2000
and
2001.
the
commission
reasonably
concluded
that
respondents
had
not
made
the
requisite
showing
under
the
federal
power
act
and
under
this
court's
decisions
in
mobile
and
sierra
that
modification
of
the
contracts
was
necessary
in
the
public
interest.
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
ferc
first
drew
on
three
factors
that
this
court
had
identified
in
sierra
and
found
that
they
were
not
satisfied.
thus,
it
found
that
respondents
had
failed
to
show
that
the
contracts
would
impose
financial
strain
on
the
purchasing
companies;
that
it
would
impose
excessive
burdens
on
the
customers;
or
that
they
were
unduly
discriminatory.
but
ferc
also
looked--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is...
that
is
correct,
and
ferc
thought
that
perhaps
the
decision
could
be
limited
to
the
circumstances
arising
out
of
the
california
energy
crisis
in
the
years
2000
to
2001,
and
that
it
could
channel
its
concerns
about
contract
stability
through
those
other
factors.
but,
nonetheless,
ferc
believes,
as
its
decisions
make
clear
and
as
our
position
in
this
court
makes
clear,
that
the
ninth
circuit's
reformulation
of
the
mobile-sierra
doctrine
or
interpretation
of
the
act
was
incorrect.
and,
now
that
the
court
has
granted
review,
we
urge
affirmance
of
ferc's
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
of
consequence,
but
ferc
still
believed
it
had
some
interpretive
authority
after
the
decision.
maybe
this
was
a
wrong
judgment
at
the
time,
but
ferc
thought
that
it
still
had
some
interpretive
authority
under
the
decision,
and
that
it
could--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
two
decisions
of
this
court
and
50
years
of
intervening
ferc,
before
that
federal
power
commission,
practice.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
that...
that
is
correct.
i
mean
it,
i
think...
i
took
the
question
to
be
that
it
might
give
ferc
broader
flexibility,
but
at
a
very
substantial
cost
to
the
stability
of
contracts,
which
was
the
underlying
point
that
this
court
stressed
in
its
decision
in
sierra:
that
the
federal
power
act,
unlike...
and
the
natural
gas
act,
unlike
the
interstate
commerce
act,
contemplates
that
rates
will
be
set
by
contract,
or
at
least
can
be
set
by
contract;
and
that
therefore,
like
in
most
situations,
a
party
to
a
contract
cannot
unilaterally
walk
away
from
that
contract
or
insist
upon
its
modification
because
it
may
become
disadvantageous
over
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
ferc--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i
think...
i
mean
there
are...
there
are
two
interpretive
questions
here:
when
does
the
public
interest
standard
identified
in
this
court's
decisions
in
mobile
and
sierra
apply?
and
then
there
is
the
further
question
of
what
is
necessary
to
satisfy
the
public
interest
standard
for
modifying
a
contract.
we
think
on
both
points
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
reflects
an
interpretive
judgment
that
the
court's
decision,
or
the
interpretation
reflected
in
the
court's
decision,
in
sierra
applies
equally
in
the
market
based
rate
system
without
any
of
the...
either
of
the
two
prerequisites
that
the
ninth
circuit
formulated
as
a
precondition
to
applying
the
public
interest
standard.
and
i
would
point
the
court's
attention,
in
the
joint
appendix
in
the
commission's
decision,
to
joint
appendix
1244
and
1245,
repeated
again
at
1572
and
1573;
and
also
the
passage
quoted
in
the
morgan
stanley
brief
at
page
17,
reflects
a
determination
of
what
the
commission's
longstanding
policy
has
been
that,
contracts
once
entered
into,
their
integrity
must
be
protected
and
should
not
be
lightly
set
aside.
and
also,
the
commission
specifically
rejected
at
pages
1564
and
1565
of
the
joint
appendix
the
prerequisites
that
the
ninth
circuit
came
up
with
in
this
case,
that
there
must
be
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
the
rates
were
within
a
zone
of
just
and
reasonableness
at
the
time
the
contracts
were
entered
into
in
order
for
mobile
and
sierra
to
apply.
under
a
market
based
rate
system,
what
ferc
does
is
determine
at
the
outset
when
an
applicant
applies
for
a
market
based
tariff
whether
that
company
has
market
power
and
if
so,
whether
it's
mitigated.
only
in
those
circumstances
is
the
company
granted
the
authority
to
market...
to
set
prices
by
the
market.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
the
commission
determined
in
this
case
is
that
there
was...
there
was
no
manipulation
or
exercise
of
market
power
identified
with
respect
to
these
specific
contracts.
and
what
the
commission
decided
was
that
the
importance
of
the
integrity
of
contracts
in
that
circumstance
required
that
the
contract
be
maintained.
if
the
respondents
had
shown
bad
faith
or
something
like
that
in
the
connection...
or
fraud
in
connection
with
the
formation
of
these
particular
contracts,
that
would
have
been
quite
a
different
matter.
it's
also
important
to
note
that
the
commission
found
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
dysfunction
in
the
forward
market,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
what
was
going
on
is
that
there
was
dysfunction
in
the
spot
market
in
2000,
2001
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
some
of
them
going
to
market
fundamentals
such
as
a
shortage
of
generation
capacity,
a
shortage
of
hydropower.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no
it
can...
i'm
sorry--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--once
it
has
granted
market
based
rate
authority,
ferc
can
revoke
that.
and
in
fact,
companies...
there
is
a
triennial
review
of
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
it
would
be
revoked--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
wouldn't
be
retroactive.
it
would
be
from
the
date
of
the
complaint
that
was
filed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
in
that
situation
there
is
an
important
public
interest
in
eliminating
fraud.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
or
market
manipulation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are.
and
this
is
the
point
i
was
going
to
make--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
i
was
going
to
make
that
point
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
if
it
turns
out
that
subsequent
evidence
shows
that
a
particular
company
has
acquired
market
based
power,
then
ferc
can
revoke
that
authority
on
a
going
forward
basis
to
continue
to
sell
on
that
basis.
and
in
fact,
companies
are
required
to
report
any
changes
in
their
circumstances
that
might
affect
their
market
power,
and
there
is
a
triennial
review
of
that.
but
as
long
ago
the
market--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
was,
and
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
in
the
lockyer
decision.
but
that
is
the
sort
of
flaw
and
market
oversight
that
should
be
addressed
directly
by
ferc.
it
shouldn't
be...
it
shouldn't
be
addressed
by
collateral
attacks
on
contracts
that
were
entered
into
under
the
regulatory
regime
as
it
existed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that
is
certainly
correct.
i
think
the
question,
what
concerned
the
ninth
circuit...
actually,
the
ninth
circuit
wasn't
addressing
market
power.
it
was
addressing
the
possibility
of
market
dysfunction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
we
don't
think
it
should,
except
to
the
extent
the
public
interest
standard
is
met.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
it
could
revoke
the
market
based
power
going
forward.
and
with
respect
to
manipulation,
especially
if
there
was
manipulation
affecting
the
particular
contract,
that
would
be
a
basis
for
finding
that
the
public
interest
required
the
contract
to
be
modified.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
is
such
a
challenge,
but
what
ferc
has
concluded
is
that
the
public
interest
standard
has
to
be
satisfied
in
that
situation.
ferc
encouraged
parties
to
go
into
the
long
term
market
in
order
to
diminish
the
market
volatility
and
it
would
frustrate
that
encouragement
of
policy--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
was
extensive
staff
studies
and
monitoring
in
subsequent
decisions
that
are,
that
are
shown
and
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
in
april...
in
january
and
april
and
june
when
ferc
came
up
with
its
final
program
to
mitigate
the
problems
in
the
spot
market.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
on
page
1589
of
the
joint
appendix
the
commission
said
we've
reviewed
the
staff
reports
findings
in
the
100-day
discovery,
which
were
discovery
occurring
in
other
proceedings,
and
found
no
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
market
manipulation
that
specifically
affected
the
contracts
at
issue.
it's
important
to
recognize
that
there
were
two
separate
markets
here.
there
was
the
spot
market,
which
had
struck
in
addition
to
all
the
weather
and
all
those
things,
it
had
structural
problems
requiring
the
california
investor
owned
utilities
to
trade
on
the
spot
market,
which
contributed
to
the
opportunities
for
the
manipulation.
the
dysfunction
and
manipulation
were
tied
together
in
that
market,
but
there
was...
the
alj
found
that
the
long
term
market
was
not
dysfunctional.
it
was
functioning,
it
operated
as
it
should.
both
parties--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--ferc
has
great
discretion
in
deciding
how
to
apply
the
public
interest
standard.
it's
not
necessary
to
find
that
they
were
absolutely
separate.
it's
sufficient,
though,
to
say
that
the
problems
in
the
two
separate
markets...
the
situations
in
the
two
separate
markets
were
very
different.
and
in
the
long
term
market,
ferc
concluded
it
was
important
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
contracts,
indeed,
under
a
market
based
system,
as
justice
alito
said,
more
important
now
even
than
at
the
time
of
mobile,
because
you
can't
have
a
functioning
market
based
rate
system
without
confidence
that
contracts
would
be
upheld.
in
that
situation,
as
this
court
suggested
in
verizon,
you
had
sophisticated
buyers
and
sophisticated
sellers
dealing
in
a
situation
in
which
both
knew
that
there
was
chaos
in
the
spot
market,
that
there
was...
there
were
structural
problems
there,
and
that
there
were
allegations
of
manipulation.
but
those
allegations
did
not
carry
over
to
the,
to
the
long
term
market.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
but
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
and
what
the
commission
was
basically
saying
is
we
are
treating
the
long
term
market
situation
differently.
some
of
these
sellers
may
have
been
engaged
in
manipulation
in
the
short
term
market,
but
ferc
was
trying
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
spot
market
and
moving
forward
and
maintaining
the
integrity
of
markets
in
the
long
term
where
both
the
buyers
and
the
sellers
were
both
buyers
and
sellers
typically.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
we
don't
think
ferc
should
have
to
engage
in
a
market
based
evaluation
of
possible
manipulation
in
order
to
hold
two
parties,
two
sophisticated
parties
to
their
bargain.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
manipulation
in
the
spot
market,
we
think
ferc
properly
concluded,
did
not
have
to
be
taken
into
account--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that's
something
that
ferc
would
have
to
decide
in
this
case.
but
i
don't
believe
a
claim
of
that
sort
has
been
made
here.
i
believe
the
claim
has--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that's
the
best
way
to
read
ferc's
decision
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
ferc...
our
position
is
that
ferc
was
not
required
in
the
public
interest,
which
looks
at
the
market
as
a
whole
not
just
the
two
parties
to
the
contract,
it
looks
to
the
consequences
for
the
market
as
a
whole
in
unraveling
particular
contracts
because
there
might
have
been
manipulation
somewhere
else.
we
think
ferc,
recognizing
the
importance
of
integrity
of
contracts,
could
decide
that
it
was
going
to
look
no
further
than
the
particular
contracts
at
issue
in
deciding
whether
there
was
market
manipulation.
