mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
tax
case
and
that
makes
a
difference.
it's
not
a
case
about
a
monopoly,
and
what's
key
about
that
is
that
kentucky
has
not
taken
over
the
national
municipal
bond
market.
it
hasn't
taken
over
the
market.
it
is
trying
to
regulate
the
market
with
this
facially
discriminatory
tax.
it
is
facially
discriminatory
because
on
its
face
the
statute
says
if
you
buy
in
kentucky
an
in-state
bond
you
have
a
tax
exemption.
if
you're
in
kentucky
and
you
buy
the
out-of-state
bond,
we
tax
you.
this
is
no
different
from
the
bacchus
case
or
the
fulton
case
or
boston
stock
exchange.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it's
very
different,
your
honor.
oh,
no,
it's
very
different,
mr.
chief
justice,
from
united
haulers.
there
inherent
in
the
power
to
take
over...
the
state
took
over
the
local
trash
handling
market...
the
power
to
create
a
monopoly
is
the
power
to
exclude
all
competition.
here
kentucky
does
not
have
a
monopoly.
they
merely
issue
the
commodity.
then,
once
it
is
in
private
hands,
an
interest
is
being
paid.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
three
reasons,
justice
breyer.
first,
as
this
court
stated
in
oregon
waste,
the
purpose
of
or
justification
for
a
law
has
no
bearing
on
whether
it
is
facially
discriminatory.
secondly,
as
this
court
held
in
bacchus,
as
long
as
there
is
some
competition
between
the
locally
produced
exempt
product
and
nonexempt
products
from
outside
the
state,
there
is
a
discriminatory
effect.
here
if
you
look
at
what...
what
are
these
bonds?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
certainly,
your
honor.
under
the
market
participant
doctrine,
if...
if
you
want
to
sell
cement
and
you
own
the
state-owned
cement
plant,
you
can
choose.
you
recall
in
south-central--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that's
what
this
court
held
in
reeves
v.
stake.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
through
a
tax,
no.
and
i
think
the
court's
precedent
in
south-central--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--there
the
state
is
supplying
educational
services
to
its
citizens,
and
under
the
market
participant
doctrine
that
would
be
fine.
i
think
this
hypothetical--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
that's
not
what
the
tax--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
that
would
be
a
subsidy,
and
this
court
drew
the
very
distinction
in
the
new
energy
case
as
the
difference
between
subsidy
and
a
tax.
and
that
i
think
is
absolutely
critical;
and
i
think
here
justice
holmes'
admonition
that
a
page
of
history
is
worth
a
volume
of
logic
makes
sense.
the
rallying
cry
for
the
american
revolution
was
"no
subsidies
without
representation",
it
was
"no
taxation
without
representation".
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
i
think...
i
think
there
you
would
look
through
the
form
to
the
substance,
and
the
substance
there
is
we
will
charge
you
x
amount
for
tuition
and
we
are
giving
you
part
of
that
back
as
a
rebate.
that
is
no
different
from
a
subsidy.
here
is
completely
different,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well
here,
your
honor,
as
the
court
made
plain...
made
plain
in
the
camps
case,
camps
newfound/owatonna,
a
tax
exemption
is
not
the
sort
of
direct
state
involvement
in
the
market
that
falls
within
the
market
participation
doctrine.
there
is
a
key
difference
between
a
tax
and
a
subsidy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
not
in...
the
part
that
they
are
taxing
is
not
their
participation
part.
i
think
a
hypothetical
will
crystalize
this.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because,
justice
souter,
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
two.
a
tax
tears
down;
a
subsidy
builds
up.
if
you
want
to
subsidize
your
local
park--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
not
constitutionally,
justice
souter,
and
here
is
why--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because,
justice
souter,
here
what
the
state
is
taxing
is
the
out-of-state
commodity.
it
is
taxing...
it
is
doing
a
downstream
regulation.
the
state
issues
a
commodity...
just
like
in
south-central;
the
state
issued
the
timber;
the
state
owned
the
timber,
and
then
it
imposed
a
downstream
regulation
on
the
purchase--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
your
honor,
it's
no
different
than
the
boston
stock
exchange
case,
where
we
are
talking
about
securities...
or
in
fulton,
your
honor...
shares
of
stock.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
the
state
is
using
its
taxing
power
to
regulate...
to
regulate
interstate
commerce,
whereas
in
united
haulers,
chief
justice
roberts,
there
was
no
tax.
there
was
no
discriminatory
tax.
and
inherent
in
the
power
to
create
a
monopoly
is
the
inherent
power
to
preclude
competition.
here
there
is
competition.
there
is
economic
gamesmanship,
justice
souter.
they
want
to
sell
their
bonds
nationally
but
hoard
their
own
investment
dollars
locally,
which
is
precisely--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
because
there
again
we
have
a
monopoly.
the
state
took
over
the
entire
market...
the
trash
disposal
facility
of
recycling
and
everything
else
in
the
united
haulers
case.
inherent
in
the
power
to
create
a
monopoly
is
the
power
to
exclude
competition.
there
is
no
discrimination
by
definition.
here
they
have
not
taken
over
the
market.
they
are
imposing
a
downstream
regulation
by
taxing
the
out-of-state
commodity,
and
the
distinction
is
exactly--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
think,
chief
justice
roberts,
the
analysis
that
the
court
made
in
the
new
energy
case
is
directly
on
point
and
addresses
this.
there
the
court
said
the
commerce
clause
does
not
prohibit
all
state
action
designed
to
give
its
residents
an
advantage
in
the
marketplace,
but
only
action
of
that
description
in
connection
with
the
state's
regulation
of
interstate
commerce.
direct
subsidies
of
domestic
industry
does
not
ordinarily
run
afoul
of
that
prohibition;
discriminatory
taxation
does.
again--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because
justice
souter,
the
entire
purpose
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
market.
if
kentucky
wants
to
have
a
subsidy
and
say
we
are
going
to
subsidize
our
own
residents,
fine.
that
builds
up
something
in
kentucky.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because,
justice
souter,
what
they
are
doing
here
is
imposing
a
facially
discriminatory
tax.
they
have
the
burden
of
saying,
under
the
court's
precedents,
they
have
no
other
alternative.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
in
1919,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because,
justice
souter,
this
case
represents
a
classic
race
to
the
bottom
where
the
only
reason
why
we
have
these
discriminatory
tax
laws
is
because
new
york
started
it
in
1919.
it
wanted
to
hoard
its
own
local
investment
dollars
and
yet
sell
its
bonds
nationally.
every
other
state
caught
on,
and
that
creates
a
problem
in
the
marketplace
which
the
dormant
commerce
claim--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
a
compact
is
precisely,
your
honor,
what
the
dormant
commerce
clause
was
designed
to
prevent...
states
coming
together
and
trying
to
create
regional
compacts
or
trying
to
create
favored
trade
deals
among
themselves.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
even
if
they
lose
this
case--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
justice
breyer,
the
whole
point--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
think...
i
think
that
the
court's
analysis
in
quill
is
on
point
here.
in
the
court's
analysis
in
quill
the
court
said
look,
we
have
this
very
clear
rule
that
says
states
cannot
engage
in
facially
discriminatory
taxation.
they
can't
do
it.
and
if,
in
fact,
we
are
wrong...
if,
in
fact,
the
court's
precedent
creates
a
problem,
then
it's
something
that
congress
can
easily
fix.
the
states
can
go
to
congress.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but,
chief
justice
roberts,
the
same
could
have
been
said
for
the
problem
in
granholm,
where
26
states
had
the
same
no
direct
shipment
problem;
or
the
same
problem
in
bacchus
where
36
states
had
the
same
discriminatory
alcohol
tax
laws.
congress
didn't--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but,
chief
justice
roberts,
congress
is
as
unlikely
to
address
this
problem
now
that
it's
so
pervasive
as
it
was
to
address
the
problem
in
granholm,
or
the
problem
in
bacchus,
or
any
of
those
other
cases,
or
the
problem
in
fulton.
congress
has
plenty
of
other
things
to
do.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
breyer,
this
case
is
like
milk.
that's
what
that--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--if
you
look
at...
it
is...
it
is,
chief
justice
breyer.
if
you
look
at
bonds,
municipal
bonds...
and
we
have
some
samples
of
an
alabama
bond
and
a
kentucky
bond
in
the
supplemental
appendix.
these
are
standardized
forms
that
are
traded
as
commodities
like
any
other
securities.
they
have
the
same
regulatory
overlay,
which
is
distinct
from
general
motors
v.
tracy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
the
point...
two
points,
chief
justice
roberts...
one
is
that
in
united
haulers
we
did
not
have
a
tax
on
the
out-of-state
commodity
coming
in.
here
we
do.
the
second
thing...
and
i
think
this
is
critical...
we
have
a
monopoly.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but,
justice
stevens,
that
points
out
how
this
is
a
downstream
regulation.
the
state's
participation
ends
when
it
is
done
issuing
the
bond.
it
goes
to
underwriters
who
then
trade
them
in
the
privately-owned
national
bond
market,
no
different
than
in
south
central.
the
state
of
alaska
owned
the
timber.
it
sold
the
timber
in
the
marketplace.
then
it
sought
to
impose
this
downstream
regulation.
it
would
be
the
same
as
if
new
york
city
said,
we
have
a
local
water
company,
and
we
have
a
monopoly.
and
now
we
have
someone
who
we
are
licensing,
a
private
business,
to
bottle
that
water
to
sell.
and
we
are
slapping
a
tariff
on
poland
springs
from
maine,
because
we
want
to
protect
the
local
business.
that's
what's
happening
here.
the
state
has
already
issued
the
commodity.
it
is
now
in
the
marketplace,
and
now
they
are
basically
prohibiting
the
sale
of
it,
or
they
are
restricting
the
sale,
by
a
discriminatory...
in
essence,
tariff.
if
you
live
in
kentucky,
we
want
to
discourage
you
from
buying
a
michigan
bond.
and
they
do
it
by
saying
we
will
tax
the
interest
on
the...
on
the
out-of-state
bond,
and
not
tax
the
interest
on
the
in-state
bond.
they
are
giving
themselves
a
leg
up.
and
one
of
the
pernicious
aspects
of
this
is
that
it
has
the
effect
of
pooling
capital
within
the
national
market.
it
has
the
effect
of
creating
this
discriminatory
barrier.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
true,
justice
stevens,
but
they
don't
want
to
issue
refunds.
you
can
understand
that.
a
short-term
gain
for
a
long-term
solution
that
would
make
them
all
better
off,
that
would
end
this
race
to
the
bottom.
my
clients,
the
davises,
are
penalized
because
they
are
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
they
are
penalized.
because
they
own
out-of-state
bonds,
they
pay
a
tax.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
for
the
same
reason
that
it
wouldn't
be
limited
with
the...
the
taxpayer
in
fulton
or
the
in-state
taxpayer
in
bacchus,
where
they
are
basically
arguing
that
this
affects
interstate
commerce.
and
as
illustrative
of
that,
we
are
saying
look,
in
bacchus
you
had
the
local
brandy,
and
the
local
pineapple
wine
got
a
tax
rate.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
they
can
argue
about
the
discriminatory
effects
of
this
law
on
the
marketplace
as
a
whole,
because
they
are
participants
in
the
market.
they
are
penalized
for
engaging
in
interstate
commerce,
the
same
way
that
all
of
the
same
arguments
were
presented
in
the
bacchus
case
with
an
in-state
taxpayer,
the
fulton
case
with
an
in-state
taxpayer.
and
the
court
has
basically
made
that
plain
in
the
new
energy
case.
you
don't
have
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
some
overwhelming,
you
know,
sky
is
falling
problem.
any
discrimination
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce,
any
discriminatory
effect,
basically--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--the
remedy,
your
honor,
would
be
for
the
state
to
decide
whether
it
wants
to
make
all
municipal
bonds
tax-exempt
or
to
make
them
all
taxable.
now,
in
kentucky
there
is
a
constitutional
provision
which
says
they
cannot...
they
basically
cannot
have
their
own
bonds
other
than
tax-exempt.
so
unless
they
change
their
constitution,
the
result
would
be
to
make
all
the
bond,
municipal
bonds,
tax-exempt
in
kentucky,
which,
of
course,
would
benefit
my
clients,
who
hold
out-of-state
municipal
bonds.
but
consider
this--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but,
chief
justice
roberts,
consider
these
two
critical
points:
one
cardinal
principle
of
investment
is
diversification.
these
discriminatory
tax
laws
basically
compel
people
to
hold
only
the
bonds
within
their
particular
state.
prospectuses
for
these
single-state
bond
funds
say:
warning...
not
diverse.
the
second
thing
is
their
higher
cost.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
that
simply
means
that
if
the
state
has
a
very
high
income
tax,
say,
in
california,
that's
all
the
more
reason,
all
the
more
penalty,
for
people
who
want
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
and
diversify
their
portfolios.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
kentucky
has
a
lower
income
tax,
but
i
think
on
the...
on
the
problem
that
was
raised,
what
if
we...
if
we
affirm
in
this
case,
what
would
the
impact
be?
well,
the
state
of
kentucky
has
said,
itself,
that
if
it
has
to
pay
out
refunds,
we
are
talking
about
a
$4
million
per
year
refund
obligation
the
state
of
kentucky
has
said
it
will
have
to
pay.
the
sky
is
not
going
to
fall.
what
would
happen
is
that
bond
prices
might
adjust,
but
we
would
have
the
free
national
market
with
interstate
trade
and
municipal
bonds
unimpaired
by
these
artificial
constraints.
these
artificial
discriminatory
tax
regimes
create
artificial
demand.
they
pull
assets.
they
hoard
assets,
local
investment
dollars,
within
particular
states.
and
you
have
a
problem
where,
say,
cash-scarce
states
like,
for
example,
tennessee
have
more
of
a
restricted
access
to
capital
markets
like
new
york.
if
you're
an
investor
in
new
york
and
you
have
money
to
spend
in
municipal
bonds,
you're
discouraged
from
buying
tennessee
bonds;
you're
encouraged
from
buying
new
york
state
municipal
bonds.
the
relatively
capital-scarce
states
are
harmed.
again,
people
like
the
davises,
they
are
harmed,
they
are
penalized
from
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
actually
have
that,
justice
kennedy.
ohio,
when
it
enacted
its
discriminatory
tax
scheme
here
similar
to
kentucky's,
it
basically
said:
we
will
tax
the
bonds
of
an
out-of-state
state,
unless
they
do
not
tax
utah
bonds.
so...
but
you
can
see
that
clearly
illustrates,
to
me--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--inconsistent,
justice
kennedy.
inconsistent.
this
is
nothing
more
than
an
ongoing
low-level
trade
war.
it
was
started
by
new
york
in
1919,
when
it
basically
created
this
discriminatory
tax
scheme
for
itself.
it
basically
incentivizes
all
the
states
to
follow
suit.
and
it's
easy
to
understand
why.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
would,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
where
congress
specifically
speaks
to
permitting
a
particular
practice,
then
it
can't
violate
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
here
congress
has
not
spoken.
the
states
are
doing
this
on
their
own.
and,
justice
kennedy,
again,
it
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
vision
of
the
framers
because
what's
happening
here,
again,
is
the
race
to
the
bottom,
where
new
york
said:
all
right,
we're
going
to
sell
our
bonds
nationally;
ah,
we're
going
to
create
an
investment
for
all
the
capital
in
new
york
to
stay
in
new
york.
and
you
can
see
why
every
other
state
afterwards
said:
oh,
look
what
new
york
is
doing.
we
have
to
follow
suit
to
try
to
equal
the
playing
field.
and,
again,
that
is
at
the
heart
of
the
ongoing
low-level
trade
war
with
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but,
chief
justice
roberts,
here
it's
easy
to
tell
what
the
market
is.
kentucky
municipal
bonds,
in
spite
of
the
tax
discrimination,
sell
in
a
national,
single
market.
there
is
a
national
federal
overlay.
under
federal
income
tax
purposes,
they're
all
tax
exempt.
they're
all
regulated
under
the
same
federal
securities
laws.
the
fraud
parts
of
the
securities
laws
apply.
they
all
compete
for
each
other.
it's
the
fact
that
they
compete
for
each
other.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
there
is
no
good
data
on
that
information,
justice
stevens.
we
do
not
have
an
answer
to
that.
but
i
think
the
point--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
we
do
not,
justice
stevens.
we
do
not.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
there
is
balkanization,
but
it's
not
complete
balkanization,
just
like
the
tax
in...
that
hawaii
imposed
on
the
alcohol
didn't
prevent
the
sale
of
fine
california
chardonnay
imported
into
hawaii;
it
just
promoted
the
sale
of
the
locally
produced
wine.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
complete
ban,
as
this
court
explained
in
limbach,
a
complete
ban
or
a
discrimination
that
imposes
a
burden.
there's
no
constitutional
difference.
and
that
applies
here
too,
but
the
market
criteria
the
court
applied
in
gmc
versus
tracy,
i
think,
applies
here.
you
don't
look
to
define
the
market
by,
gee,
what's
going
to
happen
or
what's
the
purpose
of
the
particular
discrimination?
you
look
at
ordinary
commercial
factors.
and
here
the
ordinary
commercial
factors
are
there
is
one
national
market
in
which
these
standardized
commodities
trade.
they're
issued
by
the
state.
they're
owned
by
individuals.
kentucky
doesn't
own
the
bonds.
kentucky
issues
them.
they
are
then
traded
in
the
national
market.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
if
they
choose
to
do
that,
that's
fine.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
of
course
that
would
not
be
prevented
by
having
nondiscriminatory
taxes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that's
an
idiosyncratic
value,
not
shared.
most
investors
care
about
yield
and--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but,
justice
kennedy,
that
strikes
me
as
the
argument
that
japan
made--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
kennedy,
that
strikes
me
as
the
argument
that
japan
made
when
it
said:
we
should
keep
american
made
skis
out
of
the
japanese
market
because
japanese
snow
is
different
from
american
snow.
i
mean
you
can't
use
those
kinds
of
justifications
to
say--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but,
chief
justice
roberts,
every
tax
serves
a
public
purpose.
every
tax
is
for
the
state's
purposes.
if
this
court
opens
the
door
in
this
case
to
say
that
this
facially
discriminatory
tax
regime
is
okay,
this
court
will
open
the
door
to
all
of
the
discriminatory
taxes
the
court
has
heretofore
struck
down.
this
case...
this
court's
discriminatory
tax
precedents--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
every
state
does
that.
and
i
think
we
need
to
maintain
three
clear
distinctions:
taxes,
monopolies,
and
subsidies.
they
are
constitutionally
distinct.
why?
if
you
look
at
the
constitution,
you
see
all
kinds
of
restrictions
on
discriminatory
taxes.
there
is
no--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
the...
this
court's
dormant
commerce
clause
precedents
are
directed
to
preserving
the
integrity
of
markets.
once
you
stray
and
you
do
not
have
those
clear
lines
between
monopolies,
united
haulers,
discriminatory
taxes,
and
subsidies,
then
i
think
you
make...
you
take
what
is
a
very
clear
monument
of
economic
freedom,
this
idea
of
no
discriminatory
taxes
certainly
not
discriminatory
taxes
on
their
face,
and
you
blur
those
distinctions
and
you
pull
down
this
monument
the
court
has.
as
the
court...
for
the
reasons
the
court
said
in
quill,
these
distinctions
are
important.
if
congress,
in
this
particular
area,
does
not
like
the
result,
it
can
change
the
result.
but,
jurisprudentially,
we
need
to
maintain
a
distinction
between
subsidies,
between
monopolies,
and
between
taxes.
again--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--not
quite,
justice
ginsburg.
that
was
a
full-faith-and-credit
case
in
which
the
maryland
resident
said:
oh,
i
own
out-of-state
bonds;
therefore
maryland
can't
tax
me
because
the
out-of-state
state
wouldn't
tax
me
if
i
lived
there.
a
completely
different
issue,
your
honor.
this
issue
was
not
before
the
court
in
bonaparte.
thank
you.
