mr.
trower,
were
private
activity
bonds
considered
at
all
below?
as
far
as
i
understand,
this
is
not
a
private
activity
bond,
it's
not,
what's
at
issue
here.
and
there
was
no
adjudication
with
respect
to
that
type
of
bond--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
lower
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
any
different
from
a
tax
credit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
example
that
was
given
of
a
interstate
compact,
say,
to
operate
a
port
authority
that
covers
a
few
states,
and
the
compacters
agree
that
they
are
not
going
to
tax
the
income
on
bonds
issued
by
the
port
authority,
but
they
are
going
to
tax
the
income
from
out-of-state
municipal,
but
it's
only
the
bonds
from
this
port
authority.
so
they...
it
seems
your
theory
would
reach
that
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
congress
has
approved
compacts
that
say
just
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court,
in
that
old
bonaparte
case,
it
was
just
kind
of
very
naive
because
the
court
made
a
decision
that
didn't...
that
state
a
can't
create
bonds
that
are
going
to
be
exempt
from
tax
in
other
states,
right?
