chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-666,
department
of
revenue
of
kentucky
v.
davis.
mr.
trower.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
a
different
variation
here
that
wasn't
present
in
united
haulers,
which,
of
course,
is
that
kentucky
does
compete
with
other
public
entities
in
the
municipal
bond
market.
in
other
words,
i
think
you
have
a
strong
case
with
respect
to
discrimination
against
private
bonds,
but
kentucky
competes
against
ohio
bonds
as
well.
and
they're
making
the
kentucky
bonds
more
attractive
through
this
discriminatory
tax
on
the
ohio
bonds.
why
isn't
that
a
sufficient
distinction
from
united
haulers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
you
could
achieve
the
same
result
simply
by
providing
you're
not
going
to
pay
interest
to
somebody
who
is
not
a
kentucky
resident.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
have
to
overrule
bacchus
to
agree
with
you?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
your
argument
depend
upon
the
uses
to
which
kentucky
is
putting
these
proceeds?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
it
would
because
you're
saying
nobody
else
is
responsible
for
public
works
in
kentucky
and
so
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
just
a
public
facility.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
kentucky
had
a
law
that
it
could
only...
no
out-of-state
car
dealer
could
sell
cars
in
kentucky,
that
benefited
kentucky
car
dealers,
and
then
it
had
a
special
tax
on
kentucky
car
dealers
to
fund
local
hospitals,
airports,
roads,
whatever...
that
would
be
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
matter?
so
the
use
to
which
the
proceeds
are
put
doesn't
save
an
otherwise
discriminatory
activity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
trower.
mr.
brunstad.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
united
haulers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
want
to
suggest...
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
result
in
united
haulers
would
have
been
different
if
there
were
a
competing
trash
processing
facility
out-of-state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
are
not
taxing
the
out-of-state
commodity.
their
tax
is
imposed
simply
on
kentucky
taxpayers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
our
approach
in
the
general
motors
case
was
the
exact
opposite.
there
we
couldn't
figure
out
whether
the
market
for
natural
gas
was
captive
or
not
captive.
it
was
a
little
of
each,
and
we
kind
of
said
well,
you
know,
if
it's
kind
of
a
close
question,
leave
it
for
congress.
because,
after
all,
the
commerce
clause
talks
about
congress'
power.
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
not
mentioned.
so
this
is
an
area
where
congress
can
regulate
if
it
wants
to,
and
it
has
never
shown
the
slightest
interest
in
interfering
with
state
tax
exemptions
for
their
own
bonds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
strikes
me
as
much
more
fundamental,
whether
or
not
a
state
can
issue
a
tax
exemption
for
its...
its
bonds.
that
seems
more
fundamental
than
the
more
specialized
issues
in
those
other
cases.
and
i
think
we
have
said
when
you're
dealing
with
a
specialized
issue
that
may
not
get
the
attention
of
congress,
we
have
a
different
approach.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
not
distinct
from
united
haulers.
garbage
is
garbage,
too.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
fact
that
bonds
are
bonds
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
very
responsive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
that
you
just
presented
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
think,
relies
on
the
discrimination
against
the
out-of-state
issuers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
clients
are
not
out-of-state
issuers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
don't
have
an
overbreadth
doctrine
under
the
commerce
clause.
why
aren't
their
arguments
limited
to
discrimination
against
them
rather
than
discrimination
against
out-of-state
issuers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
kentucky
taxpayers
can
argue
about
the
discrimination
against
out-of-state
bond
issuers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
know
that
your
clients
will
be
better
off
regardless
of
how
this
case
is
resolved?
one
way
to
resolve
it,
of
course,
would
be
to
take
away
the
kentucky
tax
exemption,
which
would
hurt
your
clients.
another
way
to
resolve
it
would
be
to
extend
the
tax
exemption
to
the
ohio
bonds,
which
may
hurt
your
clients
if
the
kentucky
bonds
aren't
competitive,
and
the
price
of
the
kentucky
bonds
goes
down.
they
are
going
to
lose
either
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
whether
or
not
it
benefits
them,
it
seems
to
me,
depends
on
how
competitive
they
are
with
other
states'
municipal
bonds.
in
other
words,
their
advantage
now
comes
from
the
tax
exemption
for
kentucky
bonds;
and
it's
not
clear,
if
that
is
eliminated
across
the
board,
that
kentucky
bonds
are
going
to
be
competitive
with,
you
know,
bonds
of
whatever
other
state.
so
the
value
of
them
may
go
down,
and
your
clients
may
lose,
whether
you
win
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean
it...
it
provides
an
advantage
depending
on
the
level
of
the
state
income
tax
and,
i
suppose,
the
level
of
the
exemption.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
that's
the
only
bonds
they
are
going
to
hold.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it's
less
of
a
problem
if
it's
like
kentucky,
which,
i
assume,
has
a
lower
income
tax.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
assumes
it's
all
in
the
definition
of
your
market.
if
your
market
is
tax-exempt
bonds
nationwide,
it's
one
thing;
but
your
brother
says
the
market
ought
to
be
people
who
issue
bonds
for
public
works
in
kentucky,
and
kentucky
is
the
only
one
who
does
that
so
there
is
no
discrimination
against
anyone
else
because
nobody
else
is
similarly
situated
to
kentucky
with
respect
to
kentucky
public
works.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
it
was
inherent
in
your
argument
that
most
of
them...
i
mean,
if
you're
talking
about
hoarding
capital,
it
doesn't
work
very
well
if
a
lot
of
people
outside
kentucky
are
buying
these
bonds.
there's
not
much
balkanization
if
they're
circulated
widely.
i
thought
that
your
argument
depended
on
the
proposition
that
most
of
these
bonds
are
bought
by
kentucky
residents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
fair
because
kentucky
is
going
to
use
the
proceeds
of
the
bonds
to
build
a
hospital,
a
school
that
is
going
to
serve
kentucky
residents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there's...
it's
not
just
emotional
attachment
to
kentucky
that
would
promote
the
purchase
of
those
bonds
by
kentucky
residents.
it's
self-interest.
they
want
a
public
hospital
nearby,
and,
therefore,
it
makes
sense
to
buy
the
hospital
bonds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
a
very...
there's
a
very
big
difference
between...
and
it
gets
to
the
difference
with
the
wisconsin
cows,
which
was
addressed
in
united
haulers.
that's
a
tax
on
private
activity,
and
private
actors
don't
have
the
responsibility
of
providing
government
services.
kentucky
does.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
see
a
dormant
commerce
clause,
though.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
brunstad.
mr.
trower,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
do
you
care,
mr.
trower?
i
mean,
if
you
lose
your
tax
exemption,
it
means
you've
got
to
pay
more
interest
to
sell
your
bonds,
but
it
also
means
you're
going
to
get
taxes
that
you
don't
get
now.
isn't
it
kind
of
a
wash?
does
it
really
matter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
the
state's
going
to
have
more
money
from
their
income
taxes,
and
if
they
want
to
spend
it
on
a
project
in
a
particular
municipality,
they
will
be
free
to
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
trower.
the
case
is
submitted.
