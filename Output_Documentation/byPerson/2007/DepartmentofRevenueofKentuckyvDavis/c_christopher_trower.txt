mr.
c.
christopher
trower
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
kentucky's
tax
exemption
for
municipal
bond
interest
paid
by
kentucky
and
its
political
subdivisions
to
kentucky
taxpayers
treats
all
private
entities
the
same,
and
favors
only
kentucky
and
its
political
subdivisions.
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
law
which
favors
government,
whether
the
state
or
local
government,
rather
than
private
business
enterprises
violates
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
united
haulers
holds
that
state
laws
which
favor
government
but
which
treat
all
private
business
entities
in
state
and
out
of
state
the
same
does
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
private
activity
bonds,
a
subset
of
which
are
conduit
bonds,
account
for
approximately
20
percent
of
all
municipal
bonds
issued.
and
i
think
your
question
has,
has
two
point
to
it.
first
of
all
is
whether
or
not
a
state
or
a
municipality
ought
to
be
able
to
use
its
tax
exempt
borrowing
power
to
further
a
project
chosen
by
the
municipality
to
achieve
public
purposes,
such
as
for
example
tax
exempt
hospitals
or
other
facilities
that
are
tax
exempt,
should
it
be
able
to
use
that
tax
exempt
borrowing
power
constitutionally?
the
answer
there
is,
yes.
congress
has
already
made
that
decision.
the
second
question
is
whether
there's
a
commerce
clause
problem
if
a
state
exempts
it's
own
private
activity
bonds
but
taxes
private
activity
bonds
issued
in
other
states?
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
that's
correct,
that
the
immediate
beneficiary
of
the
bonds
or
of
the
loan
is
a,
is
a
nongovernmental
entity.
it's
not
necessarily
a
private
business.
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
80
percent
of
all
private
activity
bonds
go
for--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--that
is
correct.
it
would
be
a
nongovernmental
entity
that
would
be
able
to
borrow
at
a
tax
exempt
rate.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
i
thought
the
distinction
that
you
drew
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
carbone
between
the
one
entity
that
has
got
to
get
the
job
done
within
the
jurisdiction
is
the
key
distinction
in
observing
united
haulers.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
no.
you're
doing...
the
dormant
commerce
clause
in
no
way
restricts
the
ability
of
states
to
provide
economic
incentives
for
in-state
business
activity.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
that's
exactly--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--that
is
exactly
right,
ma'am.
and
our
position
is
that
respondents
have
no
standing
to
make
a
claim
focused
solely
on
private
activity
bonds,
because
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
whether
respondents
own
any
private
activity
bonds.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
the
difference
is,
is
twofold.
one,
the
favoritism
in
the
first
example,
the
dairy
cases,
which
have
come
up
a
million
times,
is
a
favoritism
of
a
private
industry,
whereas
in
your
second
hypothetical
the
favoritism
is
to
the
most
public
of
industries,
education.
the
second
difference
is
that
a
tax
on
out-of-state
dairy
products
increases
the
cost
of
out-of-state
dairy
products
to
in-state
consumers
with
no
detriment
to
in-state
dairy
producers,
whereas,
as
our
respondents
have
pointed
out
in
their
brief,
when
a
tax
is
imposed
by
a
government
on
a
transaction
where
the
government
itself
is
paying
the
money,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
a
tax
on
interest
income
paid
by
the
government,
the
effect
is
to
impose
a
dollar-for-dollar
reduction
in
the
government's
tax
revenues
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
exemption.
so
you've
got
an
in-state
entity,
namely,
the
government
itself,
that
is
suffering
a
revenue
loss.
that's
not
at
all
comparable
to
the
dairy
hypothetical.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
if
a
hamburger
stand
is
owned
by
the
state,
it's
okay
under
united
haulers.
if
the
state
wants
to
go
into
the
dairy
business,
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
prevent
the
state
from
doing
that.
that's
our
answer,
is
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
extend
to
activities
by
a
state
on
behalf
of
all
of
its
people.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
the
key
distinction
in
the
united
haulers,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
between
an
entity
with
the
responsibility
for
the
welfare
of
the
citizens
within
the
jurisdiction
versus
all
other
entities.
it
just
happened
to
be
in
united
haulers
that
that
was
a
public
entity
versus
private
entities.
but
united
haulers,
we
submit,
would
have
reached
exactly
the
same
result
if
the
trash
haulers
had
wanted
to
take
the
garbage
to
a
municipal
or
a
public
facility
in
new
jersey,
as
opposed
to
a
private
facility
in
new
jersey.
and
the
second
answer
to
your
question
is
that
other
public
entities,
other
states,
other
municipalities
have
no
responsibilities
in
kentucky
for
the
public
welfare.
they're
no
different
than
private
borrowers
in
kentucky.
they
don't
have
sovereign
immunity
in
kentucky
if
they
default
on
their
bonds.
they
can
be
sued
in
kentucky
court.
that's
the
essential
difference.
the
question
i
think
that
the
justice
breyer
brought
up
would
also
lead
me
to
talk
about
what
are
the
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause
writ
large,
or
the
dormant
commerce
clause
not
writ
large,
that
have
motivated
this
court's
jurisprudence?
i
think
there
are
three:
economic
protectionism,
which
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
does
not
apply
to
activity
by
the
state
on
its
open
behalf;
secondly,
the
free
market
or
free
trade
rationale,
which
has
motivated
many
of
the
court's
decisions,
but
at
the
same
time
the
court
has
always
been
careful
to
say
that
the
free
trade
rationale,
maine
v.
taylor
for
example,
does
not
value
free
trade
above
all
other
values
that
we
have.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
value
here
is
the
fundamental
sovereignty
of
the
states.
our
political
system
subdivides
responsibility
for
government
and
responsibility
for
public
works
in
america.
bonds
are
not
issued
by
the
states
to
make
a
profit
or
to
leverage
their
return
on
equity.
bonds
aren't
issued
to
create
an
investment
opportunity
for
wall
street
or
for
main
street.
bonds
are
issued
to
finance
the
essential
work
of
government.
and
this
court's
decision
should
look
at
that
part
of
the
equation
as
much
more
significant
and
weigh
those
values
much
more
heavily
than
the
values
of
the
free
market,
which
don't
really
apply
to
the
state's
provision
of
goods
and
services.
in
all
the
dairy
cases--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--that
would
be
completely
constitutional.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
sir,
that
would
be
totally
permissible
and
would
achieve
the
same
result
as
the
exemption
that
we've
got
here.
so
what
you've
got
before
you
is--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--i
thought
the
question
was
if
the
bonds
increased
the
interest
rate
and
limited
the
purchasers
to
kentucky
citizens.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
they
could
sell
them
to
anyone
else.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
it
would
be...
let
me
back
up.
i
think
i
got
ahead
of
myself
there.
it
would
be
entirely
constitutional
for
a
state
to
offer
bonds
for
sale
and
limit
the
sale
to
kentucky
residents
and
limit
the
payment
of
interest
to
kentucky
residents
and
have
a
mechanism
to
assure
that
that
would
be
the
case.
for
example,
contract
submissions
by
brokers.
the
sec
does
that
right
now
thousands
of
times
each
day
with
rule
144
sales.
the
administrative
mechanism
would
be
there.
would
it
be
constitutional?
yes,
sir.
our
point
is
we've
got
a
giant
market
upon
which
the
states
depend
for
the
financing
of
public
goods
and
services.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
it
would
be.
we've
got
the
same
analogy
in
the
securities
law,
where
the
intrastate
exemption
is
conditioned
upon
the
holder
of
the
security
being
an
in-state
resident
who
must
agree
not
to
transfer
the
security
out
of
state.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
sir,
you
could.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
it
could.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes,
sir,
as
well
as
an
attention...
as
i
was
going
to
earlier,
the
larger
principles
that
are
behind
the
dormant
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
of
the
court.
the
court
has...
we
talked
about
economic
protectionism.
we
talked
about
the
free
trade
rationale.
and
then
the
third
rationale
which
comes
up
often
in
the
court's
opinions
is
political
solidarity.
that
is
to
say
that
the
commerce
clause
was
not
a
grant
of
power
to
the
national
government
to
enact
free
trade
laws,
but
rather
it
was
a
grant
of
power
to
the
national
government
to
prevent
union-dividing
friction
between
the
states.
we
don't
have
that
friction
here.
all
49
states
support
kentucky's
position.
where
that
political
friction
is
not
an
issue,
the
need
for
judicial
invalidation
of
the
laws
of
42
states
is
commensurately
less.
on
the
other
hand,
what
are
the
things
that
we
think
that
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
require...
doesn't
require
the
states
to
do?
it
doesn't
require
the
states
to
give
up
incentives
to
local
business
activities
within
the
state.
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
throw
into
the
maw
of
the
free
market,
the--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--well,
bacchus
was
a
case
which
favored
the
in-state
pineapple
wine
producers--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--with
a
tax.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
that
doesn't
surprise
me
at
all,
justice
stevens,
because
your
concurring
opinion
in
alexandria
scrap
said
the
same
thing.
we
agree
with
that
position.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
no,
sir.
the
suggestion
that
we're
making
here
today
is
that
a
tax
exemption
which
applies
directly
and
exclusively
to
the
payment
of
money
by
a
government
to
its
direct
trading
partners
is
all
you're
dealing
with
here.
that
would
not
change
the
result
in
bacchus,
boston
stock
exchange,
or
any
of
the
other
discriminatory
tax
cases
because
all
of
those
cases
involved
a...
a
tax
or
an
exemption.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
no,
sir.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
thought
you
meant
it
made
a
difference
whether
they
spent
them
on
an
airport
or--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--yes,
sir.
governmental.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
i
don't
think
that
would
be
all
right.
i
think
that's
the
west
lynn
creamery
case
in
reverse.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
the...
it
is
the...
it
is
the
entity
which
chooses
the
use
to
which
the
proceeds
are
put
that
determines
the
commerce
clause
situation.
the
choice
of...
of
sewers,
airports,
schools,
that's
up
to
the
governmental
entity
to
make.
i'll
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
let's
start
with
the
idea
that
the
kentucky
tax
penalizes
respondents
for
participating
in
interstate
commerce.
the
answer
there
is
no.
the
kentucky
tax
affords
a
direct
trading
partner,
that
is
to
say
a
person
that
owns
kentucky
bonds,
a
quid
pro
quo.
if
a
kentucky
taxpayer
loans
money
to
kentucky,
kentucky
gives
a
tax
exemption
to
that
person
that
loans
money
to
kentucky.
if
a
kentucky
resident
chooses
to
loan
money
to
california
by
buying
california
bonds,
no
tax
exemption
is
afforded.
but
that
different
treatment
is
not
a
penalty,
we
would
submit,
but
rather
a
recognition
that
the
kentucky
resident
who
loans
money
to
kentucky
is
entitled
to
receive
something
in
return.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
it
matters
tremendously,
your
honor.
seventy-five
percent
of
all
municipal
bonds
issued
in
america
are
issued
by
municipalities,
local
agencies,
and
those
bonds...
under
$10
million
in
principal
amount...
those
bonds
account
for
only
7
percent
of
the
total
volume
of
bonds
outstanding.
we
pointed
this...
citations
for
this
are
in
our
reply
brief.
the
significance
would
be
that
many
municipalities
might
have
no
market
access
at
all
for
their
bonds.
an
investor
could
ignore
75
percent
of
all
bonds
that
are
issued.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
they
would
be
and
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
that
choice
is
a
choice
that
the
commerce
clause
lets
the
states
make,
the
choice
to
either
raise
taxes
or
to
have
a
tax
exemption.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
well,
all
of
the
cases
in
which
the
tax
exemption
or...
or
other
restrictive
law
favored
in-state
private
business
would
be
left
untouched.
what
we're
arguing
for
here
is
a
rule
that
would
apply
only
to
a
transaction
between
the
state
itself
and
the
bondholder.
market
participation,
contrary
to
my
brother's
suggestion,
does
not
end
when
the
bonds
are
issued
any
more
than
when
you
borrow
money
your
participation
with
your
lender
ends
once
the
loan
is--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
if
it's
approved
by
congress,
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
i
think
that--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--you
could
make
that
argument,
justice
kennedy.
but
the...
the
idea
that
what
has
happened
here
is
a
race
to
the
bottom
is
post
hoc
reasoning
extraordinaire.
the
kentucky
constitution
was
enacted
in
1890,
40
years
before
kentucky
had
ever
enacted
an
income
tax.
the
california
constitution,
which
also
requires
california
to
exempt
its
own
bonds,
was
enacted
decades
before
california
enacted
an
income
tax.
we
would
suggest
that
the
record
of
history
is
the
states
saw
the
opportunity
to
give
their
own
residents
tax
exemption
as
a
way
of
finding
a
natural
market
for
their
bonds,
and
they
chose
to
do
that
and
that
the
fact
that
they
chose
to
do
that
makes
sense
for
the
states
that
did
it.
it
also
made
sense
for
those
states
that
didn't
choose
to
do
that.
i
would
note
that
the
seven
states
that--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--well,
it's...
i
wouldn't
accept
that
as
the
reason
that
the
commerce
clause
exists
as
a
check.
but
let's
examine
that
analysis.
where
is
the
political
check
here?
well,
we
know
how
the
other
states
would
vote
because
they
support
kentucky.
sifma,
which
represents
90
percent
of
the
bond
trading--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--there's
no
doubt
that
the
law
on
its
face
differentially
treats
two
different
kinds
of
bonds
or
different
bonds
issued
by
different
states.
we're
not
contending
that
at
all.
the
question
is,
is
whether
that
different
treatment
is
permissible?
the
suggestion
that
the
commerce--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--that's
right.
that's
exactly
right.
and
if
we
were...
if
we
were
reading
the...
the
negative
commerce
clause,
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
decisions
in
reeves,
which
is
exactly
equivalent
to
a
home
embargo,
because
it
kept
all
the
cement
in
south
dakota;
to
the
decisions
in
white
and
alexandria
scrap,
which
were
exactly
equivalent
to
a
border
blockade,
because
they
kept
all
the
out-of-state
workers
from
working
in
boston
or
at
least
up
to
the
extent
of
50
percent
of
the
work
forces;
and
under
alexandria
scrap
the
effect
of
the
legislation
was
to
keep
all
of
the
out-of-state
towing
companies
from
collecting
the
bounties.
and
then
in
united
haulers,
yes,
it
wasn't
a
tax
case,
but
that's
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
because
what
united
haulers
was
equivalent
to
was
a
home
embargo.
and
it's
the
home
embargo,
the
border
blockade,
and
the
discriminatory
tariff
or
tax
that
are
always
held
up
as
the
prototypes
of
things
that
our
free
market
prevents,
as
is
the
monopoly,
which
my
brother
says
is
okay
if
a
state
monopolizes
all
the
trade,
but
it's
not
okay
if
a
state
still
competes
in
the
national
market
in
the
issuance
of
bonds
but
yet
offers
a
direct
financial
incentive
to
its
own
taxpayers.
we
come
back
to
the
effect
of
a
tax
exemption
of
this
type.
it
is
exactly
equivalent
to
the
payment
of
money
by
the
state,
because
every
dollar
of
that
tax
exemption
represents
a
detriment
to
the
state.
the
state
is
giving
up
revenue.
now,
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
may
be
a
wash
at
the
end
of
the
day,
but
that's
a
decision
that
the
commerce
clause
leaves
to
the
states
to
make.
and
your
reference
earlier
to
general
motors
v.
tracy
is
directly
on
point
here,
because
there
you
had
a
well-established,
long-established
market
that
the
court
was
loath
to
jump
in
without
any
institutional
competence
or
information
to
evaluate
the
effects,
where
congress
could
take
action
if
any
was
necessary.
what
do
we
know
about
the
historical
record
here?
we
know
congress
excruciatingly
discussed,
just
analyzed
state
tax
and
their
effects
on
interstate
commerce
and
did
nothing.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
no.
that's
not
what
we're
arguing
for.
we're
not
saying
that
what
happened
here
is
equal
to
the
kind
of
express
approval
of
discrimination,
which
the
court's
precedents
have
required.
what
we're
saying
is
where
what
we
got
is
a
congress
that
has
studied
this
problem
and
done
nothing,
with
a
congress
that
has
routinely
approved
interstate
compacts
between
the
states
that
provide
for
differential
taxation
of
bonds,
with
a
congress
that
has
provided
exemption
from
all
tax
for
territory
bonds,
puerto
rico,
guam...
those
are
completely
exempt
per
acts
of
congress,
but
congress
didn't
go
any
further
than
that,
what
is
the
conclusions
for
this
court
to
draw?
does
this
court
rush
in
where
congress
has
failed
to
tread?
we
think
not.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
yes.
in
fact,
congress
had
authorized
the
kind
of
flow
control
ordinance
that
was
set
up
in
carbone.
but
as
the...
as
the
court
decided
the
carbone
case,
the
facility
in
carbone,
in
the
view
of
the
majority,
was
not
a
publicly
owned
facility.
it
was
a
privately
owned
facility.
if
carbone
came
up
again
today,
maybe
a
different
analysis.
but
the
distinction
between
carbone
and
united
haulers
was
discussed
at
length
in
united
haulers,
and
the
court
found
that
a
distinction--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--i
don't
know
that
there
wasn't
that
same
kind
of
congressional
acquiescence.
the
question
is...
is
what...
what
is
the
court
to
make
of
that
congressional
acquiescence
or
congressional
failure
to
act?
that's
what
we
are
arguing
for
here.
we
are
not
saying
congress
has
sanctioned
differential
taxation.
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
prudential
versus
benjamin.
i
guess
that's
the
insurance
case,
which
of
course
we've
got--
mr.
c.
christopher
trower
--yes,
sir,
and
that's
obviously
huge
as
well.
i
think
that's
enough.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
