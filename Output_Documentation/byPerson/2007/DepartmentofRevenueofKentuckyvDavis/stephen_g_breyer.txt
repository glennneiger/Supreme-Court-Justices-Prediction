justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
you...
and
i
have
the
same
hypothetical
for
both
you
and
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
with
some
adjustment
here,
because
i'm
finding
the
case
quite
difficult.
and
the,
the...
for
you,
imagine
we
have
some
milk
producers
in
kentucky.
they
are
farmers.
and
they
go
to
the
legislature
and
they
say,
you
know,
we
can
sell
a
lot
more
milk
in
kentucky
if
you
will
pass
a
law
imposing
a
tax
on
missouri
farmers
who
want
to
ship
milk
into
kentucky.
that's
the
classic
unlawful...
all
right.
it's
unlawful,
unconstitutional,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
is
the
difference
if
a
city
in
kentucky
that
wants
to
finance
its
schools
says
now
to
the
legislature,
we're
going
to
find
it
easier
to
sell
bonds
in
kentucky
or
elsewhere,
in
kentucky,
for
our
school
system
if
you'll
only
put
a
tax
on
similar
bonds
that
missouri
is
offering
to
finance
their
city
schools?
that
will
help,
just
like
the
milk.
now,
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
consumers
in
the
dairy
products
that
are
suffering
loss.
they're
all
the
voters
in
the
states.
everyone
drinks
milk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
are
suffering
a
dollar-for-dollar
loss,
because
their
milk
becomes
more
expensive.
i
don't
know
if
that's
analogous.
i
think
it's
a
pretty
strong
analogy.
as
to
the
first,
that's
of
course
the
point
that's
worrying
me.
it
is
true
that
this
is
a
public
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
make
a
difference
in
the
first
case
if
it
happened
to
be
some
dairy
farmers
who...
there
are
so
few
in
massachusetts
now,
unfortunately,
that
they
all
work
on
state-owned
dairy
farms
that
are
put
up
for,
you
know...
does
it
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
of
course
you
win
as
soon
as
we
say
the
commodity
is
the
same
as
milk.
obviously
to
me
you
would,
but
that's
the
issue.
and
in
united
haulers
what
the
question
was,
i
thought,
is
if
it
is
a
traditional
governmental
function,
anyway...
say,
like
producing
electricity,
or
cleaning
the
streets...
there
they
discriminate
and
say
you
have
to
buy
in
state...
well,
it's
different,
and
indeed
it
may
be
okay.
so
what
you've
just
heard
your
brother...
brother
argue
is
if
this
is
a
fortiori,
because
here
it's
not
even
making
electricity;
it's
not
even
collecting
trash;
it
is
financing
the
most
basically
governmental
of
all
governmental
institutions...
libraries,
schools,
streets.
now,
why
isn't
it
a
fortiori
from
united
haulers,
given
the
nature
of
the
task
that
they
are
raising
the
money
to
finance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
arguing...
but
can
a
state
do
this?
it
produces
a
service
or
product;
it
sells
the
service
or
product
to
in-state
people
at
a
price
50
percent
less
than
it
sells
to
out-of-state
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
you're
saying
if
the
state
owns
cement,
it
can
sell
50
percent
less
to
its
in-state
citizens
than
out-of-state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
could
it
do
this?
could
it
say
that
if
you
buy
cement
from
out
of
state,
the
answer
is
no,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
what
they
are
selling
is
education?
can
the
university
of
california
say
that
when
you
send
your
child
to
the
university
of
california,
you
will
get
a
thousand
dollars
back
on
your
income
tax.
but
if
you
send
the
child
to
an
out-of-state
school,
you
don't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
if
that's
fine,
then
what
they
say
is
we
sell
you
participation
in
the
financing
of
the
project.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
buy...
we
sell
you
the
participation.
it's
called
a
bond,
and
if
in
fact
you
give
the
money
to
us,
and
you
are
in-state,
you
get
a
thousand
dollars
back.
but
if
in
fact,
when
you
do
the
identical
thing,
and
you
buy
a
similar
thing
from
out-of-state,
you
do
not
get
the
money
back?
how
is
that
different
from
what
you
just
said
was
okay
in
respect
to
the
university
of
california?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
sorry,
then
i
wasn't
clear
in
the
hypothetical.
the
hypothetical
was
that
you
get
a
thousand-dollar
rebate
on
your
income
tax.
so
i
was
trying
to
make
it
exactly
like
this
case.
you
pay
a
lower
state
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
have
a
perfectly
good
remedy
in
respect
to
that.
if
the
states
don't
like
this
race
to
the
bottom,
they
need
only
create
a
compact
or
go
to
congress.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
i
was
only...
i
was
only
addressing
your
point
that
there
was
a
practical
problem.
insofar
as
there
is
a
practical
problem,
it
seems
to
me
the
states
have
a
perfectly
good
remedy
even
if
they
lose
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
win
the
case,
whatever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
however.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
argument
cuts
against
you
in
context,
i
think.
you're
saying
in
every
case
of
any
kind
of
discrimination
one
could
go
to
congress.
absolutely
right.
and
since
that's
true
of
every
case,
now
we
are
back
to
the
more
basic
question,
leaving
the
practicalities
that
you
were
talking
about
out
of
it,
of
whether
this
case
is
more
like
the
cows.
is
it
more
like
the
garbage
collection?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
is
it
on
the
far
side
of
the
garbage
collection,
even
a
stronger
case
for
permission
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
where
i
wanted
you
to
begin.
