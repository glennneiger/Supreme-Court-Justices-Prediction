justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
a
state
said
that
it
was
unlawful
for
anyone
other
than
a
state
resident
to
purchase
the
bond?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
constitutional
to
say
that
the
holder
of
the
bond
must
always
be
a
kentucky
resident
or,
if
you
sold
the
bond,
it
has
to
be
to
another
kentucky
resident?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
new
york
has
a
very
strong
financial
community,
it
can
really
benefit
its
citizens
by
keeping
the
market
in
new
york
bonds
for
itself,
if
it
chooses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
case
for
that
is
what,
united
haulers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
can
ask
your
brother
who
represents
petitioner...
maybe
i'd
better
should...
i'd
get
a
better
answer
from
him
so
far
as
his
position.
as
you
understand
his
position,
as
you
understand
the
state's
position,
would
it
be
permissible
for
state
a
to
go
to
state
b
and
say:
we...
if
you
make
your
bonds
nontaxable
to
our
residents,
we'll
make
your
bonds
nontaxable
to
your
residents.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
find
that
consistent
with
the
vision
of
the
framers
for
our
national
market
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume
there
would
be
a
preference
to
massachusetts
milk
for
massachusetts
buyers,
to
michigan
automobiles
for
michigan
buyers,
and
the
state
did
not
subsidize.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--authorities--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
that's
true.
there's
a
national
securities
market.
everybody
knows
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
think
either
side
can
avoid
that
fact.
he's
suggesting
that
it
cuts
more
in
his
favor
than
it
does
for
yours
because
you
are
creating
artificial
barriers
to
that
market.
so
that
when
a
person
who
knows
about
kentucky
bonds
and
who
knows
what
the
good
ones
are
moves
out
of
state,
he
all
of
a
sudden
loses
the
advantage
to
purchase
those
bonds
anymore,
or
at
least
he
does...
he
takes
a
penalty
for
doing
that.
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this,
the
question
i
asked
your
co-counsel.
a
and
d
get
together
and
agree
on
reciprocal
advantages
for
their...
for
their
respective
residents.
is
that
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it's
not.
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
isn't
that
exactly
what's
happening
here?
isn't
that
exactly
what's
happening
here?
you
have,
in
effect,
a
pact
among
states
to
favor
their
own
residents.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
any
favored
legislation
favoring
local
industry
helps
the
state,
and
the
state
residents
like
it.
that's
the
whole
point.
that's
why
the
commerce
clause
exists
as
a
check.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
politics
is
local.
all
states
want
to
protect
their
residents
and
make
it
look
like
they're
doing
something
for
their
residents.
and
that's
exactly
the
purpose
of
commerce
clause
prohibition
against
explicit
discrimination,
which
is
what
this
is.
there's
no
doubt
that
this
is
explicit
discrimination.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are...
what
are
examples...
what
are
examples
of
federal
statutes
that
have
allowed
explicit
discrimination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
insurance
industry?
