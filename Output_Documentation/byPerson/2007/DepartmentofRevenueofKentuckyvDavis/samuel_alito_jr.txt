justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
what
you
just
said
true
about
conduit
bonds,
where
kentucky
issues
bonds
to
finance
private
construction?
is
the
statement
that
you
just
made
accurate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
what
you
do,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
as
a
dissenter
in
united
haulers,
i
also
don't
think
it's
a
good
distinction.
[laughter]
but
couldn't
there
be
instances
where
some,
an
industrial,
a
company
is
trying
to...
is
deciding
to
locate
a
plant
and
is
choosing
between
kentucky
and
ohio,
and
kentucky
says,
come
to
kentucky
because
we'll
issue
private
activity
bonds
so
that
you
can
finance
this
more
cheaply
than
if
you
went
into
ohio?
and
when
you
do
that,
aren't
you,
aren't
you
doing
exactly
what
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
supposed
to
prevent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
would
that
achieve
the
same
result
if
these
bonds
weren't
negotiable
and
they'd
be
hard
to
sell,
hard
for
you
to
sell,
if
people
who
bought
them
couldn't
sell
them,
and
they
could
sell
them
to
somebody
out
of
state
and
get
the
higher
interest
rate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
these
would
be
bonds
that
kentucky
citizens
could
not
sell
to
anyone
else?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
anyone
who
wasn't
a
kentucky
citizen?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
a
lot
of
arguments
that,
if
accepted,
would...
maybe
this
isn't
true
of
all
of
your
arguments,
but
certainly
many
of
them
would
demonstrate
that
the
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
is
utterly
incoherent.
if
taxation
is
the
same
thing
as
a
subsidy,
if
congressional
inaction
is
the
same
thing
as
approval,
if
kentucky
bonds
are
not
really
in
the
same
market
as
out-of-state
bonds,
what
would
be
left
of
commerce,
of
dormant
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
if
those
arguments
were
accepted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
want
us
to...
do
you
want
us
to
hold
that
if
congress
is,
quote,
unquote,
aware
of
some
sort
of
discrimination
that
the
states
are
engaging
in,
that
there
is,
therefore,
no
dormant
commerce
clause
problem?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
situation
and
the
sort
of
flow
control
ordinance
that
was
involved
in
carbone?
wasn't
congress
aware
of
those?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
why
wasn't
there
the
same
kind
of
congressional
whatever
it
is,
acquiescence,
in
carbone
that
you're
claiming
there
was
here?
