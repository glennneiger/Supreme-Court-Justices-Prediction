what
if...
what
if
the
state
offered
its
taxpayers
a
higher
interest
rate
than
purchasers
from
other
states?
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
bacchus
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i've
always
thought
it
was
incorrectly
decided,
to
be
honest
with
you,
but
it's
there.
it's
been
there
a
long
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
a
state--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
didn't
have
a
tax
on
the
out-of-state.
you
have
an
income
tax
charged
to
kentucky
residents
on
their
income
from
that
bond.
it's
quite
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
victims
under
your
approach,
as
i
understand
it,
are
the
49
other
states,
and
all
of
them
seem
to
support
your
opponent
in
the
briefs
that
were
filed
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
how
much...
what
percentage
of
the
kentucky
bonds
are
bought
by
kentucky
residents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it...
do
we
have
it
for
any
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
really
standardize.
even
without
a
tax
exemption,
residents
of
kentucky
would
be
interested
in
public
improvements
in
kentucky
and
have...
give
a
slight
edge
in
the
market
to
all
kentucky
bonds.
i
think
there
would
be
just
a
natural
preference
for
locally
issued
bonds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
not
totally
fungible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it's
a
fact
of
the
market,
it
seems
to
me,
that
kentucky
bonds
are
characteristically
more
attractive
to
kentucky
citizens
than
they
are
to
out-of-state
citizens.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
talking
about
not
just
a
dormant
commerce
clause,
but
a
dormant
congress.
