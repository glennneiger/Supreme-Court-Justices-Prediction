justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
raise,
in
effect,
sort
of
a
distinction
between
carbone
and
united
haulers?
or
at
least
one
way
of
understanding
the
distinction
between
those
two
cases?
in
carbone
the
facility,
in
fact,
was
not
the
facility
of
the
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
here
the,
the
immediate
beneficiary
of
the
bonds
is,
in
justice
alito's
hypo,
is
a
private
entity?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
just
a
matter
of
fact.
i
thought
in
most
instances
the
immediate
beneficiary
would
be
a
private
entity
who,
in
effect,
was
enabled
to
borrow
at
a
lower
rate?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
don't
you
have
to
take...
therefore,
if
you're
going
to
answer
justice
alito
as
you
did,
don't
you
have
to
take
the
position
that
carbone
really
is
not
good
law
and
the
carbone/united
haulers
distinction
is
not
a...
is
simply
not
a
relevant
distinction?
as
a
dissenter
in
carbone,
i
naturally
do
not
find
that
the
worst
answer
you
could
give.
[laughter]
but
don't
you
have
to
give
that
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
that
case,
the
only
thing
the
state
was
doing
was
taxing.
here
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
in
the
case
we've
got,
the
state
is
also
participating
in
a
bond
market.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
we
draw
that
line?
i
mean,
you...
a
moment
ago
you
were
talking
about
the...
the
realities
of
subsidy.
why
don't
we
confront
the
realities
of...
of
the
fact
that
the
state's
participation
in
the
bond
market
and
the...
and
the
tax
exemption
go
together
hand
in
hand?
it's
unrealistic
to
divide
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what?
the
economic
reality
is
precisely
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
not
constitutionally,
we
have
said,
in
cases
in
which
the
state
is
not
acting
purely
as
the
regulator.
here
the
state
is
not
acting
purely
as
the
regulator.
the
state
has
a
dual
capacity,
and
you
say
ignore
one
side
of
that
capacity
for
the
other;
and
my
question
is
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it's
not
taxing
an
out-of-state
commodity
in
the
sense
of
a
commodity
which
is
manufactured
or
produced
out-of-state.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
which
case
the
state
was
not
a
participant,
but
the
state
is
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
this
situation
is
somewhere
in
between
the
two.
because
although
we
do
not
have
what
in
form
is
a
subsidy,
we
have
what
in
economic
reality
is
a
subsidy
for
the
benefit
of
the
state's
own
activity
as
a
bond
issuer.
so
the
question
again
is,
why
do
we
accept
your
characterization
that
this
case
should
be
treated
exactly
as
if
the
state
were
acting
merely
in
a
regulatory
capacity?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
whole
purpose
of...
of
the
combined
effect
of
market
participant
for
the...
acting
for
the
purpose
of
providing
an
essentially
governmental
service
is
to
give
the
state
a
free
hand.
why
do
we
ignore
that
in
your
argument
in
favor
simply
of
the
regulatory
side?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
question
is
whether
it
will
be
treated
as
we
treat
a
facially
discriminatory
tax
when
there
is
no
market
participation,
there
is
no
state
participation
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
fundamental
governmental
service.
if...
if
in
fact
there
is
a
good
reason
to
treat
them
differently,
then
we
don't
follow
the...
the
facial
discrimination
test.
let
me...
let
me
ask
a...
a
question
with
that
as
the
premise.
assuming...
and
i
obviously
do
assume...
that
we
have
a
choice
of
analysis
here,
one
good
reason
to
choose
the
analysis
that
your
brother
has...
that
the
state
is
forwarding
is
the
fact
that
we
have
historically
a
bond
market
which
has
grown
up
since
new
york
issued
the
first
tax-exempt
or...
a
bond.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we
have
an
enormous
market,
the
effect
of
interrupting
which
we
really,
as
a
court,
cannot
tell
very
much.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
very
good
reason
to
give
the
nod
to
the...
to
the
market
participant,
the
essential
services
side
of
what
the
state
is
doing,
as
opposed
to
the
regulatory
side,
and
simply
confront
the
thing
under
pike.
why
isn't
that
a
good
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky.
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
exempts
from
state
income
taxation
any
interest
on
bonds
issued
by
the
commonwealth
in
its
political
subdivisions.
at
the
same
time
as
it
taxes
the
interest
earned
on
bonds
issued
by
other
states.
this
way,
it
--
it
decreases
the
interest
cost
of
borrowing
money
for
its
own
public
projects.
40
other
states
employ
the
same
scheme
with
the
first
one
dating
back
to
1919.
respondents,
george
and
catherine
davis,
are
kentucky
residents
who
own
and
pay
state
income
tax
on
interest
from
out-of-state
municipal
bonds.
they
sued
kentucky,
claiming
that
its
differential
tax
scheme
amounted
to
local
protectionism
in
violation
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
after
the
trial
court
granted
judgment
to
kentucky,
the
state
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
differential
taxation
was
unconstitutional.
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
denied
the
commonwealth's
motion
for
discretionary
review
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
hold
that
kentucky's
tax
scheme
does
not
violate
the
commerce
clause
and
we
reverse
and
remand.
last
term,
we
decided
a
case
called
united
haulers
association
against
oneida-herkimer
solid
waste
management
authority.
that
case
decided
independently
of
our
market
participation
precedence
that
a
governmental
ordinance
requiring
trash
haulers
to
deliver
solid
waste
to
a
local
processing
plant
owned
and
operated
by
a
public
authority
was
constitutional.
we
explained
that
laws
favoring
a
government
function
are
not
susceptible
to
standard
dormant
commerce
clause
scrutiny
owing
to
their
likely
motivation
by
legitimate
objectives
distinct
from
simple
economic
protectionism.
we
also,
warned
against
unprecedented
and
unbounded
interference
by
the
courts
with
local
and
state
government.
it
follows
from
united
haulers
that
kentucky
must
prevail
here.
the
issuance
of
debt
securities
to
pay
for
public
projects
is
a
quintessentially
public
function
with
a
venerable
history.
bonds
help
state
and
local
governments
finance
projects
that
protect
health,
safety
and
welfare
of
citizens
and
the
apprehension
in
united
haulers
about
unprecedented
interference
with
a
traditional
governmental
function
is
just
as
warranted
here.
the
davis's
would
have
us
invalidate
a
century-old
taxing
practice
that
is
presently
employed
by
41
states
and
affirmatively
supported
in
this
court
and
by
all
50.
what
is
more,
we
have
previously
held
that
a
foreign
state
is
properly
treated
as
a
private
entity
with
respect
to
state
issued
bonds
that
have
travelled
outside
its
borders.
viewed
through
this
lens,
the
kentucky
tax
benefits
a
clearly
public
issuer,
kentucky,
while
treating
oral
private
issue
as
exactly
the
same.
it
does
not
involve
desperate
treatment
of
substantially
similar
entities,
the
hallmark
of
forbidden
discrimination.
some
members
of
the
--
of
the
court
--
i
have
also
looked
at
this
case
under
the
broader
rubric
of
the
market
participation
exception
to
the
dormant
commerce
clause
which
applies
when
states
participate
in
the
market
rather
than
acting
in
a
wholly
regulatory
capacity.
kentucky's
regulation
by
taxation
goes
hand-in-hand
with
its
market
participation
by
selling
bonds.
like
the
laws
upheld
in
prior
market
participant
cases,
kentucky's
differential
tax
is
tied
to
the
public
object
of
its
foray
into
the
market
which
gives
the
scheme
a
civic
objective
different
from
the
typical
goals
of
unlawful
discrimination.
we
note
that
differential
tax
schemes
facilitate
the
issuance
of
bonds
by
smaller
municipalities
that
the
interstate
markets
tend
to
ignore.
this
helps
to
explain
why
the
state
is
so
committed
to
this
system
and
it
underscores
how
far
the
state's
objectives
probably
lie
from
economic
protectionism
for
any
local
businesses.
having
found
no
per
se
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
we
also
hold
that
the
davis's
claim
is
not
susceptible
to
class
benefit
balancing
analysis
that
is
often
proper
under
the
case
of
pike
against
bruce
church.
the
current
record
and
scholarly
materials
show
that
the
judicial
branch
is
not
institutionally
suited
to
draw
reliable
conclusions
of
the
kind
that
would
be
necessary
for
the
davis's
to
satisfy
a
pike
burden
in
this
particular
case.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
both
filed
opinions
concurring
in
part.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
alito

and
