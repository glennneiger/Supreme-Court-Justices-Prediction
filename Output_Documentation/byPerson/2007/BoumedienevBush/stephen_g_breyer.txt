justice
stephen
g.
breyer
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
on
the
precedent,
suppose...
and
i'm
going
to
be...
i'd
like
my
mind
to
be
clear
on
this.
i
thought
that
the
question
asked
was
for
you
to
find
an
instance
where
there
was
no
sovereignty
of
the
country
and
they
issued
the
writ,
and
it
was
turning
on
a
technical
thing.
whether
that
was
how
the
question
was
met
or
not,
what
i
read
here
in
these
different
briefs
is
in
1759,
lord
mansfield,
the
case
can
issue...
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
no
doubt
the
power
could
issue
it
where
the
place
is
under
the
subjection
of
the
crown
of
england.
then
lord
sellers
in
mwenya
said
subjection
is
fully
appropriate
to
the
powers,
that's
habeas,
irrespective
of
territorial
sovereignty
or
dominion,
in
other
words,
non-technical.
in
our
case
in
rasul,
both
the
concurring
opinion
and
the
majority
opinion
say
things
like
the
reach
of
the
writ
depends
not
on
formal
notions
of
territorial
sovereignty,
but
on
the
practical
questions.
then
they
both
list
practical
questions.
now
suppose
we
take
that
as
the
definition.
now,
can
you
find
instances
where
the
writ
has
been
issued
by
britain
in
history
to
people
who
were
not
citizens
and
who
were
not
actually
held
in
britain?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
spanish
doctor,
the
swedish
doctor,
the
spanish
sailors,
the
british
spy,
they're
all
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
get
additional
process.
the
question,
i
guess,
is
whether
it
is
an
adequate
substitute
for
having
withdrawn
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
on
that
question,
suppose
that
you
are
from
bosnia,
and
you
are
held
for
six
years
in
guantanamo,
and
the
charge
is
that
you
helped
al-qaeda,
and
you
had
your
hearing
before
the
csrt.
and
now
you
go
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
and
here
is
what
you
say:
the
csrt
is
all
wrong.
their
procedures
are
terrible.
but
just
for
purposes
of
argument,
i
concede
those
procedures
are
wonderful,
and
i
also
conclude
it
reached
a
perfectly
good
result.
okay?
so
you
concede
it
for
argument's
sake.
but
what
you
want
to
say
is:
judge,
i
don't
care
how
good
those
procedures
are.
i'm
from
bosnia.
i've
been
here
six
years.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
give
anyone
the
right
to
hold
me
six
years
in
guantanamo
without
either
charging
me
or
releasing
me,
in
the
absence
of
some
special
procedure
in
congress
for
preventive
detention.
that's
the
argument
i
want
to
make.
i
don't
see
anything
in
this
csrt
provision
that
permits
me
to
make
that
argument.
so
i'm
asking
you:
where
can
you
make
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he
cannot
make
that
argument,
how
does
this
become
an
equivalent
to
habeas,
since
that
happens
to
be
the
argument
that
a
large
number
of
these
305
people
would
like
to
make?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
we
were
here
talking
about...
i
see
that
you
have
a
strong
argument
and
they'll
have
a
strong
argument
in
reply.
i
think
both
are
pretty
good,
how
you
interpret
these
cases.
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
what
the
availability
of
a
forum
in
which
you
can
make
your
argument
and
they
can
make
their
argument,
and
that's
why
i'm
back
to
the
question
of
this
is
remedy
that's
given
in
the
statute
sufficient
to
allow
you
to
make
your
argument
and
their
to
make
their
argument?
and
what
you
said
was,
when
i
thought
i
produced
an
example
of
an
instance
they
wanted
to
argue
quite
strongly,
and
you
said
no,
they
couldn't.
then
you
said
well,
neither
could
they
in
england.
well,
that
i
wonder.
that's
where
i'm
back
to.
after
all,
england
doesn't
have
a
written
constitution.
so
it
is
hardly
surprising
if
they
concede
everything
away
in
england,
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
make
any
argument.
there's
nothing
left.
but
let's
image
in
england
you
had
a
statute
and
that
statute
said
the
government
cannot
hold
an
alien
in
beckawannaland
for
six
years
without
either
charging
them
or
releasing
them.
or
except
for...
and
we
have
some
very
detailed
preventive
detention.
suppose
there
was
a
statute
like
that.
and
then
our
friends
in
england
in
whatever
year
conceded
every
argument
but
that
one.
now,
are
you
going
to
tell
me
now
that
the
habeas
courts
would
have
said
we
won't
even
listen
to
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
and
you
told
me
in
this
statute
the
court
of
appeals
will
not
listen
to
that
argument.
and
as
i
read
the
statute,
i
agree
with
you.
because
i
can
find
no
place
where
they
could
make
that
argument
since
it
does
not
concern
how
well
this
tribunal
did,
nor
does
it
concern
the
constitutionality
of
the
procedures
of
the
tribunal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wasn't
cleverly
redrafted.
i
wanted
to
say
that
the
people
i'm
thinking
of
are
not
challenging
those
procedures.
what
they
say
is
you
could
have
the
best
procedure
in
the
world,
and
they're
totally
constitutional...
we'll
assume
that...
they're
assuming
it.
they're
not
going
to
concede
it.
they're
assuming
it.
on
that
assumption,
we
still
think
that
congress,
the
president,
the
supreme
court
under
the
law,
cannot
hold
us
for
six
years
without
either
trying
us,
releasing
us,
or
maybe
confining
us
under
some
special
statute
involving
preventive
detention
and
danger
which
has
not
yet
been
enacted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
arguing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
on
that...
and
you
just
mentioned
remedy.
suppose,
contrary
to
what
you
hope
for,
that
the
court
were
to
say
that
this
is...
we
have
a
minute
or
two.
suppose
they
were
to
say
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
suspension
of
the
writ,
and
that
the
remedy
here
written
in
the
statute
is
not
adequate
in
respect
to
many
claims
that
might
be
made.
on
that
assumption,
the
habeas
would
lie.
now,
it
has
been
six
years,
and
habeas
is
supposed
to
be
speedy.
and,
yet,
people
have
serious
arguments,
anyway,
that
they
are
being
held
for
six
years
without
even
having
those
arguments
heard.
is
there
anything
in
your
opinion
that
this
court
could
say
by
way
of
remedy
that
could
get
the
d.c.
circuit
or
the
others
to
decide
this
and
the
csrt
claims,
there
are
305
people
to
do
this
quickly
within
a
period
of
months
rather
than
six
more
years?
and
if
so,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
we
faced
with
this
problem,
and
i
don't
want
to
put
you
right
on
the
spot,
what
approximately
would
you
say
in
respect
to
this?
because
it
is
a
serious
problem.
