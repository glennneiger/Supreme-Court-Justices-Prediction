justice
antonin
scalia
who
says
that...
let's
consider
first
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case.
they
decided
it...
in
rasul,
we
had
held
that
the
habeas
statute
extended
to
guantanamo,
and
that
those
people
who
had
filed
their
suits
before
the
statute,
at
least,
could
bring
a
suit.
congress
acted.
and
enacted
a
new
habeas
statute
which
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
habeas
statute,
at
least,
does
not
apply
to
these
people
in
guantanamo.
your
assertion
here
is
that
there
is
a
common
law
constitutional
right
of
habeas
corpus
that
does
not
depend
upon
any
statute.
do
you
have
a
single
case
in
the
220
years
of
our
country
or,
for
that
matter,
in
the
five
centuries
of
the
english
empire
in
which
habeas
was
granted
to
an
alien
in
a
territory
that
was
not
under
the
sovereign
control
of
either
the
united
states
or
england.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is...
what
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
cases...
what
case
in
particular
do
you
think
in
rasul?
justice
antonin
scalia
mwenya
involved
an
english...
an
english
subject,
not
an
alien.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
there
is
an
alien.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
totally
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
both
of
those
cases,
it
was
a
citizen,
nonetheless.
in
220
years
of
our
history,
or
five
centuries
of
the...
do
you
have
a
single
case
in
which
it
was
not
a
citizen
of
england
or
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
in
which
a
common-law
writ
of
habeas
corpus
issued
to
a
piece
of
land
that
was
not
within
the
sovereign
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
not
regarded
as
part
of
the
crown's
dominion,
but
they
were
part
of
the
crown's
sovereign
territory.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
try
them.
i
mean,
line
them
up.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
cases
were
decided
under
a
statute
that
applied
in
india,
not
under...
under
the
common
law.
and
the
writ
did
not
come
from
england;
the
writ
came
from
english
courts
in
india
under
a
statute.
and
we
decided
that
in
rasul.
i
mean,
you
want
to
do
that
in
rasul,
that's
fine.
but
you
are
appealing
to
a
common
law
right
that
somehow
found
its
way
into
our
constitution
without,
as
far
as
i
can
discern,
a
single
case
in
which
the
writ
ever
to
a
non-citizen.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
we
had
400,000
german
prisoners
in
this
country
during
world
war
ii.
and
not
a...
you
say
it's
clear
in
the
vietnam
example
that
the
chief
justice
gave
you,
it's
clear
that
habeas
would
lie.
400,000
of
these
people.
it
never
occurred
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
many
of
them
were
civilians,
by
the
way,
and
not
in
uniform.
not
a
single
habeas
petition
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
claims
he
wasn't
assisting
the
german
army,
just
as
these
people
here
claim
that
they
were
not
attacking
u.s.
bases.
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
was
he
held?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
he
was
being
held
in
pennsylvania?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
being
held
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
i
am
still
waiting
for
a
single
case,
other
than
the
indian
case
which
you
mentioned
which
was
under
a
statute,
a
single
case
in
which
an
alien
that...
in
a...
in
a
territory
not
within
the
crown,
was
granted
habeas
corpus.
and
it's
not
enough
to
say
there
was
a
statute
that
applied
on
the
seas.
that's
fine.
just
give
me
one
case.
there's
not
a
single
one
in
all
of
this
lengthy
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
geneva
convention
modeled
after
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
it
means
by
"prisoner
of
war"
is
the
same
thing
that
the
constitution
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
clement,
if
we
had
to
either
charge
or
release
these
people,
what
would
they
be
charged
with?
waging
war
against
the
united
states?
is
there
a
statute
that
prevents
non-citizens
from
waging
war
against
the
united
states
and
provides
criminal
penalties?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
summarize
my
dissent.
four
terms
ago
rasul
versus
bush,
this
court
rejected
the
argument
of
the
president
that
federal
court's
statutory
habeas
jurisdiction
did
not
extend
to
aliens
held
at
guantanamo
bay,
cuba.
in
as
much
as
no
federal
district
court
had
jurisdiction
over
that
place,
the
court
over
dissents,
solved
that
problem
by
decrying
that
every
federal
court
has
jurisdiction.
in
response
to
that
judgment,
no
doubt
believing
that
the
guantanamo
detention
facility
was
important
in
the
prosecution
of
the
current
war
against
islamic
extremists,
the
president
sought
authority
from
congress
to
limit
the
role
of
federal
courts
in
inquiring
into
the
detention
of
enemy
prisoners
at
guantanamo.
congress
responded
with
the
detainee
treatment
act,
which
stripped
habeas
jurisdiction,
but
setup
alternative
judicial
review
procedures
that
the
chief
justices'
dissent
today
correctly
concludes
are
adequate
substitutes
for
habeas.
but
two
terms
ago,
in
hamdi
versus
rumsfeld,
the
court
held
that
the
detainee
treatment
act
did
not
clearly
strip
habeas
jurisdiction
from
pending
case,
cases
that
had
already
been
filed
in
federal
court
when
the
act
was
passed.
the
president
again
returned
to
congress,
which
then
passed
the
military
commissions
act.
as
the
court
correctly
holds
today,
that
act
finally
succeeds
in
removing
the
federal
court's
statutory
habeas
jurisdiction
over
aliens
held
at
guantanamo.
but
rather
than
acquiesce
in
the
considered
judgment
of
the
political
branches
in
this
area
of
military
affairs,
the
court
today
holds
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional.
as
we
have
often
said
to
overrule
the
mandate
of
the
political
branches,
in
this
area
of
military
affairs,
requires
a
clear
constitutional
command,
but
the
court
has
not
found
any
such
command.
as
my
opinion
details,
the
majority's
judgment
today
is
contradicted
not
only
by
our
clear
holding
50
years
ago
in
johnson
versus
eisentrager,
but
also
by
the
settled
understanding
at
common
law
that
habeas
jurisdiction
over
aliens
did
not
extend
beyond
the
sovereign's
territory.
indeed
the
court
admits
that
it
cannot
derive
a
clear
answer
from
the
background
common
law
principles
of
habeas.
instead,
the
court
resorts
to
what
it
calls
â€œfundamental
separation
of
powers
principles",
by
which
it
means
that
there
must
be
a
role
for
the
judiciary,
lest
the
political
branches
act
with
impunity.
that
notion
is
mistaken.
although
it
is
true
that
habeas
is
an
important
tool
for
ensuring
that
the
executive
does
not
overstep
constitutional
bounds,
it
is
equally
true
that
the
traditional
limits
on
habeas
jurisdiction
are
important
to
assure
that
the
judiciary
does
not
overstep
constitutional
bounds.
we
simply
have
no
competence
to
second-guess
military
authorities
who
have
to
make
a
life
or
death
judgment
calls
about
who
is
and
who
is
not
an
enemy
prisoner.
even
when
the
matter
was
left
to
military
authorities
many
of
the
guantanamo
prisoners,
who
have
been
released
over
the
past
five
years,
have
returned
to
the
battle.
just
last
month
a
former
detainee
perpetrated
a
suicide
bombing
that
killed
seven
iraqi
soldiers.
when
uninformed
article
iii
judges
rather
than
knowledgeable
military
authorities
--
be
patient
--
under
rules
laid
down
by
congress
are
in-charge
of
determining
who
will
be
released,
this
problem
can
only
get
worse.
the
court's
opinion
appeals
to
the
rule
of
law,
but
the
rule
of
law
includes
limitations
upon
the
courts,
just
as
it
includes
limitations
upon
the
other
two
branches.
in
our
entire
history,
no
prisoner
held
by
our
military
forces
during
an
ongoing
armed
conflict
has
been
given
resort
to
our
civil
courts.
hundreds
of
thousands
of
german
prisoners
were
held
in
this
country
during
world
war
ii
and
i'm
unaware
of
any
of
them
being
--
i
am
unaware
that
any
court
ever
intervened
in
their
detention,
and
they
were
held
in
the
united
states
and
in
our
entire
history
no
writ
of
habeas
corpus
has
ever
before
issued
at
the
instance
of
an
alien
held
abroad.
congress
has
provided
for
a
significant
judicial
involvement
with
respect
to
the
detainees
at
guantanamo,
but
that
is
not
enough
for
today's
court,
which
creates
a
constitutional
right
to
habeas
for
aliens
abroad
that
has
no
precedent
in
english
or
american
law.
we
will
live
to
regret
this
self
invited
and
unprecedented
incursion
of
the
judiciary
into
military
affairs.
