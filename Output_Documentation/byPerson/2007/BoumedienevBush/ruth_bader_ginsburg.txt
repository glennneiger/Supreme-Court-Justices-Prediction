mr.
waxman,
how
could
that
be,
because
the
d.c.
circuit
never
got
to
that
question?
the
d.c.
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
ruled
that
there
was
no
access
to
habeas,
end
of
case.
so
the
d.c.
circuit
never
examined
the
procedure
under
the
dta,
did
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
shouldn't
we,
if
we
agree
with
you,
that
there
is
authority
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
send
it
back
to
them
to
make
that
determination
whether
habeas
being
required,
this
is
an
adequate
substitute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
basic
position
has
to
rest
on
guantanamo
bay
being
just
like
if
we
had
the
detainees
in,
say,
the
everglades.
but
do
you
concede
that
if
these
people
had
never
been
brought
to
the
united
states,
if
the
facility
were
in,
say,
germany,
that
these
detainees
would
have
no
access
to
habeas,
no
access
to
our
courts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
this
was
decided
in
rasul.
that's
why
i
am
so
puzzled
by
the
government's
position.
i
think
justice
kennedy
said
it
most
clearly
when
he
said
that,
well,
in
every
practical
respect,
guantanamo
bay
is
u.s.
territory;
and
whatever
congress
recently
passed,
they
can't,
as
you
pointed
out,
change
the
terms
of
the
lease.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
clement,
i
remember
in
a
prior
hearing
about
guantanamo
that
the
government
was
taking
the
position
firmly
that
these
detainees
were
not
prisoners
of
war
and,
therefore,
were
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
geneva
conventions.
so
if
the
government
is
maintaining
that
position,
these
people
are
not
prisoners
of
war,
then
the
treatment
of
a
prisoner
of
war
is
not
relevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
think,
to
go
back
to
the
beginning,
my
notion
of
your
position
was
you
never
get
to
that
question:
is
the
review
of
these
procedures
adequate
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
because
there
is
no
authority,
period,
for
the
d.c.
circuit
to
engage...
to
grant
what
is
before
us
is
if
the...
our
applications
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
you
say
that's
out
the
door.
they
might
bring
some
other
proceedings.
i
thought
that
was
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
about
taking
the
statute,
congress's
statute
that
set
up
this
system
with
limited
review
in
the
d.c.
circuit
and
saying
that's
it.
the
d.c.
circuit
never
got
to
that
question
because
it
said
the
acts
that
these
people
are
trying
to
bring
habeas
doesn't
exist.
the
only
thing
that
they
have,
the
only
remedy
they
have
is
the
one
that
congress
provided.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
that
threshold
issue.
they
tossed
it
out
and
didn't
reach...
didn't
say
one
word
about
the
adequacy
of
the
procedures
or
of
the
things
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be...
we
would
be
deciding
that
as
a
court
of
first
view
because
they
didn't
decide
that?
you
don't
need
an
adequate
substitute
for
habeas
because
you
have
no
right
to
habeas.
