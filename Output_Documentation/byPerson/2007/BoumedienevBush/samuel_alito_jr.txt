justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
it
wouldn't
matter
where
these
detainees
were
held
so
long
as
they
are
under
u.s.
control.
if
they
were
held
on
a
u.s.
military
base
pursuant
to
a
standard
treaty
with
another
country,
if
they
were
in
afghanistan
or
in
iraq,
the
result
would
be
the
same?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if,
in
a
future
war,
many
of
the
soldiers
and
the
opposing
army
don't
wear
uniforms?
what
if
it's
a
war
like
vietnam
and
thousands
of
prisoners
are
taken
into
custody
and
they
are
brought
to
prisoner-of-war
camps
in
the
united
states
as
occurred
during
world
war
ii?
every
one
of
them
under
your
theory
could
file
a
habeas
petition.
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
primary
position
is
that
we
should
order
that
they
be
released,
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
court
holds
that
the
dta
is
not
an
adequate
substitute
for
habeas,
what
will
happen?
will
these
petitioners
then
have
access
to
all
of
the
procedures
that
normally
apply
in
a
habeas
proceeding
under
2241?
the
same
right
to
discovery,
subpoena
witnesses,
access
to
classified
information,
presence
in
court?
