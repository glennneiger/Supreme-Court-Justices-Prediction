chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
06-1195,
boumediene
v.
bush,
and
case
06-1196,
al
odah
v.
united
states.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
that
we
ruled
in
the
hamdi
case
that
procedures
quite
similar
to
those
under
the
dta
were
adequate
for
american
citizens?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
our
judgment
in
this
case
depends
upon
whether
we
agree
with
you
or
the
government
that
the
procedures
available
under
the
dta
are
meaningful
under
hamdi?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
wouldn't
be
any
different
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
habeas
if
these
people
were
held
for
one
day,
would
it?
we
don't
look
at
the
length
of
detention
in
deciding
whether
habeas
is
available,
do
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let
me
just
stop
you
there.
do
you
want
this
court
to
rule
on
whether
or
not
there
are
military
exigencies
that
require
the
holding
and
detention
of
these
enemy
combatants?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
putting
aside
the
battlefield
hypothetical,
we're
talking
about
guantanamo.
your
argument
is
that
somebody
held
one
day
in
guantanamo
has
the
right
to
habeas.
so
the
extent
of
detention
is
irrelevant
to
your
assertion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
relevance
to
your...
this
line
of
reasoning
to
the
recent
enactment
by
congress
of
section
1005(g),
which
says
that
the
base
at
guantanamo
is
not
part
of
the
united
states?
there
is
a
judgment
by
the
political
branches
that
we
don't
exercise
sovereignty
over
the
leasehold,
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
if
we're
going
to
adhere
to
our
habeas
corpus
cases,
we
would
have
to
reject
that
determination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
to
determine
whether
there's
jurisdiction,
in
every
case
we
have
to
go
through
a
multi
factor
analysis
to
determine
if
the
united
states
exercises
not
sovereignty,
which
you've
rejected
as
the
touchstone,
but
sufficient
control
over
a
particular
military
base?
over
the
philippines
during
world
war
ii,
in
vietnam,
and
it
is
going
to
decide
in
some
cases
whether
the
control
is
sufficient
and
others
whether
it
isn't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
is
a
judgment
we
the
court
would
make,
not
the
political
branches
who
have
to
deal
with
the
competing
sovereignties
in
those
situations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
give
you
your
rebuttal
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
waxman,
this
determination,
whether
it's
sovereignty
or
subjugation
or
control
of
non-sovereign
territory,
would,
i
expect,
have
diplomatic
consequences.
it
is,
i
think,
typically
an
act
of
war
for
one
country
to
assert
authority
and
control
over
another
country's
jurisdiction.
and
here
we
have
section
1005g
where
congress
and
the
president
have
agreed
that
guantanamo
bay
is
not
part
of
the
united
states,
and,
yet,
you
would
have
this
court
issue
a
ruling
saying
that
it
is
subject
to
the
total,
complete
domination
and
control,
or
whatever
the
factors
are.
what
is
the
reaction
of
the
cuban
government
to
be
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we...
there
are...
am
i
wrong
that
there
are
cuban
workers
who
come
on
to
the
base
and
work?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
have
two
of
those
workers
and
they
get
into
a
fight
over
something,
one
can't
sue
the
other
in
cuban
courts?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
authority...
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that:
that
such
a
suit
would
not
lie
in
the
cuban
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
we
will
give
you
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
dta,
see,
is
unclear
to
me,
anyway,
on
this
question.
you
agree
that
there
is
the
authority
under
the
dta,
and
i
assume
under
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
in
reviewing
those
determinations,
to
order
a
release?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
2243
doesn't
specify
the
availability
of
release,
either,
but
it
has
certainly
been
interpreted
to
authorize
that
by
habeas
courts
in
this
country.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
suppose
any
challenges
to
the
adequacy
of
the
standards,
or
whatever,
are
the
sort
of
things
that
would
be
raised
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
and
we
don't
know
what
that's
going
to
look
like
yet,
because
the
d.c.
circuit
hasn't
had
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
those.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
procedures
that
are
before
us
under
the
dta
and
the
mca,
of
course,
weren't
available
for
the
whole
six-year
period,
were
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
because
the
withdrawal
of
jurisdiction
does
not
apply
to
review
of
the
proceedings
in
the
d.c.
circuit
that's
provided
under
the
statute?
in
other
words,
your
argument
that
the
habeas
jurisdiction
doesn't
extend
doesn't
reach
the
review
of
the
adequacy
of
the
dta
proceedings?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
clement.
mr.
waxman,
we'll
give
you
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
an
argument
that,
i
gather,
both
sides
agree
is
available
to
you
under
the
dta
before
the
d.c.
circuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
