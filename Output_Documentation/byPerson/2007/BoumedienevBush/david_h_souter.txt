justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
possible
for
your...
let's
say
your
six
clients
at
this
point
or
for
any
of
the
guantanamo
detainees,
i
guess,
because
wouldn't
they
all
run
into
the
problem
of...
the
neutrality
problem
that
you
raised?
the
commanding
general,
the
secretary
of
defense,
in
effect,
have
already
said
these
people
belong
where
they
are.
wouldn't
that
make
it
impossible,
really,
at
this
stage
of
the
game
to
substitute
a
military
procedure?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
just
wondering
whether
assuming
you
win
this
case,
that
would
be
an
appropriate
form
of
relief.
and
i'm
not
sure--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
have
a
quick
question.
i
don't
want
to
interfere
with
his
five
minutes
of
rebuttal.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
is
that
personal
representative
also
under
an
obligation
to
report
back
to
the
military
anything
that
might
be
unfavorable
to
the
person
he
is
supposedly
representing?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
he's
not...
he
is
not
in
the
position
of
counsel,
as
we
understand
the
term.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
the
resort
to
the
all
writs
act
beg
the
question?
and
that
is...
i
mean
the
all
writs
act
is
there
to
protect
jurisdiction,
and
the
question
is
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
to
release.
and
you
say
there
no
textual
impediment
to
it;
and,
yet,
we
know...
i
forget
which
brief
it
was
in...
from
one
of
the
briefs
the...
the
instance
of
the
prisoner
ali,
one
of
the
chinese...
is
it
"uigars"?
is
that
how
it
is
pronounced?
justice
david
h.
souter
who
was
one
of
what,
12
or
13,
who
was
found
not
to
be
an
enemy
combatant,
and
the
government's
position
there
was:
go
back
and
do
it
again
in
front
of
another
tribunal,
another
panel,
which,
in
fact,
conveniently
found
that
he
was.
so
the
practice
of...
of
the
government,
it
seems
to
me,
has
clearly
been
to
deny
the
right
to
release.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
it
was
a
practical
problem.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
effectiveness
of
habeas
jurisdiction,
for
example,
in
requiring
new
trials,
and
so
on,
depends
upon
the
ultimate
sanction,
which
is
the
authority
of
the
court
to
let
somebody
go
if
the
government
does
not
comply
with
a
condition.
and
the...
the
government
practice
so
far
under
the
dta
seems
quite
contrary
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
aren't
you
simply
rearguing
rasul?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
have
passed
that
point;
haven't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
it...
it...
it
wasn't,
and
i
didn't
want
to
get
into
the
prisoner
of
war
point.
but
if
you
want
to
get
into
it,
the
problem
with
your
prisoner
of
war
point
is
the
united
states
is
not
treating
them
as
prisoners
of
war.
they
have
not
been
adjudicated
prisoners
of
war,
or
otherwise,
under
the
third
geneva
convention,
and
that
argument
on
the
government's
part
is
entirely
circular.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
three
spanish
soldiers
were...
were
ultimately
found
to
be
prisoners
of
war,
and,
yet,
they
had
process
to
get
into
court.
there
was
no
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
an
english
court
to
entertain
their
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
relief
was
denied.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
had
a
hearing
under
the
writ.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
how
did
the
court
ever
come
to
the
conclusion
that,
in
fact,
they
were
prisoners
of
war?
justice
david
h.
souter
on
their...
on
their
own
showing,
but,
in
fact,
the
proceeding
did
not
end
until
the
court
had
come
to
that
conclusion.
it
was
not
a
conclusion
that
the
court
assumed
simply
on
the
basis
of
a
government
claim
in
the
return
to
the
writ.
justice
david
h.
souter
on
the
basis
of
a
government
claim
formally
or
informally
proffered
to
the
court.
they...
they
came
to
that
conclusion,
as
you
said,
based
on
the...
on
the
prisoners'
own
showing.
but
the
court
certainly...
there
is
no
authority
in
the
prisoner
of
war
case
for
saying
that
if
the
government
make
as
claim
that
one
is
a
prisoner
of
war...
contrary
to
the
government's
prior
position,
incidentally...
that
that
forecloses
the
possibility
of
consideration
under
the
writ...
the
petition
as
filed.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
that
because
they
were
reflecting
1789
practice,
or
because
they
were
reflecting
the
defense
of
the
realm
act?
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
unless
you
can
answer
my
question,
we
don't
know
what
the
snapshot
proves.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
were
exercising
habeas
jurisdiction
in
a
court...
in
a
polity
in
which
parliament
is
supreme
and
parliament
had
already
passed
the
defense
of
the
realm
act,
and
i
don't...
i
mean
it.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
you.
but
i
think
unless
we
have
an
answer
to
that,
we
don't
have
a
reliable
clue
as
to
the
understanding
of
the
english
courts
at
a
time
that's
relevant
to
our
inquiry.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
are
operating
today
under
a
broader
concept,
as
i
understand
it,
of
"enemy
combatant"?
justice
david
h.
souter
than
was
indeed
the
case
for
example
in
our
early
litigation,
let
alone
at
the
time
of
kirin.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
can...
and
this
again,
maybe
i
should
know
the
answer
to
this,
but
i
don't.
how
could
that
be
litigated
under
the
dta?
doesn't
any
proceeding
under
the
dta
simply
have
to
accept
the
statutory
definition?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean...
you're
saying
if
it
gets
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
can
raise
the
constitutional
claim
that
the
definition
is
broader
than
constitutionally
could
be
enforced.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
win,
we
never
get
to
these
issues.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can't
win
without
reversing
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
affirmed
on
alternative
grounds,
leaving
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
as
it
stands,
these
interesting
questions
that
you
referred
to
will
never
arise.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
they
litigate
that
adequacy
if
they
have
determined
in
advance
that
substantively
the
individuals
who
are
petitioning
have
absolutely
no
rights?
justice
david
h.
souter
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
only
thing,
as
i
understand
it,
that
could
possibly
be
adjudicated
would
be
the
question
of
formal
adherence
to
procedure
or
not.
there
would
never
be
an
adjudication
that
ever
went
to
the
merits
because
the
merits
issue,
as
i
understand
it,
is
already...
i
mean
merits
of
relief...
have
already
been
prior
admitted
by
the
existing
determination
of
the
circuit
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
were
arguing
that
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
substitution
should,
in
fact,
be
litigated
in
a
plenary
fashion
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
for
that
matter?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
there
were
all
of
these
interesting
questions
that
could
be
explored
if
there
was
a
remand?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
talking
about
in
effect
about
evidentiary
procedural
questions?
