mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
in
these
cases
have
three
things
in
common.
first,
all
have
been
confined
at
guantanamo
for
almost
six
years,
yet
not
one
has
ever
had
meaningful
notice
of
the
factual
grounds
of
detention
or
a
fair
opportunity
to
dispute
those
grounds
before
a
neutral
decision-maker.
two,
under
the
decision
below,
they
have
no
prospect
of
getting
that
opportunity.
and
three,
each
maintains,
as
this
court
explained
in
rasul,
that
he
is
quote
"innocent
of
all
wrongdoing".
now
the
government
contends
that
these
men
are
detainable,
and
the
facts
of
these
37
cases
differ,
and
it
may
well
that
be
that
an
adjudicatory
process
that
preserves
the
core
features
of
common
law
habeas
would
reveal
perhaps
that
some
of
these
petitioners
are
lawfully
detainable.
but
limited
dta
review
of
the
structurally
flawed
csrt
process
cannot
provide
any
reliable
examination
of
the
executive's
asserted
basis
for
detaining
these
petitioners,
let
alone
an
adequate
substitute
for
traditional
habeas
review.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
you
ruled...
as
i
understand
what
the
plurality
held
in
hamdi
was
that
so
long
as
there
was
a
process
accompanying
detention,
that
provided
for
meaningful
notice
of
the
factual
grounds
for
detention,
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
present
evidence
in
response
to
that
before
a
neutral
tribunal
with
the
assistance
of
counsel,
that
determination
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
substantial
deference
by
a
habeas
court;
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
not
what
they
got.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it...
i
think
your
decision
in
this
case,
the
question...
the
principal
question
we
think
is
presented
by
the
case
is
whether
or
not
the
dta
review
of
the
csrt
procedures
that
occurred
in
this
case
adequately
substitute
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
the
district
court...
the
two
district
judges
sitting
in
habeas
went
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
and
judge
green
did
evaluate
the
procedures.
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
the
constitution,
neither
the
suspension
clause
nor
the
due
process
clause,
applies
to
these
people.
and
therefore
it
didn't
reach
the
merits.
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i'm
not
saying
that
this
court
couldn't
do
that.
it
certainly
could
do
that.
but
one
of
the
principal...
the
principal
guarantee
of
habeas
corpus
through
the
centuries
has
been
a
speedy...
the
remedy
of
speedy
release
for
somebody
who
is
unlawfully
being
held
in
executive
detention.
these
37
men
have
been
held
in
isolation
for
years,
and
it
is
manifest
on
the
record
in
this
case.
there's
no
doubt
about
how
the
csrt
has
proceeded.
there
is
little
doubt
about
the
circumscribed
nature
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
review.
the
d.c.
circuit
has
already
held
that
the
constitution
doesn't
apply.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
want
to
give
a
qualified
disagreement
with
your
hypothetical,
because
it's
entirely
clear
that,
as
i
think
members
of
this
court
have
indicated
and
that
habeas
traditionally
indicates,
there
may
be
military
exigencies,
there
may
be
a
limited
time
period
in
which
it
is
inappropriate
for
a
habeas
court
to
rule.
and
moreover...
if
there--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
what
i
was
referring
to
were
sort
of
the
hypothetical
of
battlefield...
somebody
is
captured...
you
know...
and
the
next
day
or
the
next
week
from
the
battlefield,
does
he
or
she
have
the
right
to...
does
a
habeas
court
have
constitutional
jurisdiction.
putting
aside--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
think
so,
with
respect.
i
think...
i
don't
think...
i
think
it
is
appropriate
for
a
habeas...
if
the
executive
says
we
have
detained
this
person,
we
believe
this
person
is
an
enemy
combatant
who
may
be
lawfully
detained
under
the
aumf,
we
have
an
administrative
process
that
is
fair,
that
will...
that
will
determine
the
facts.
you
should
stay
your
hand
to
allow
that
procedure
to
occur.
of
course,
that
is
appropriate,
so
long
as
the
procedure
is
meaningful
and
speedy.
that's
what
we
do
in
immigration
cases.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
think
these
people
are
in
a
place
that
is
even...
that
is
under
even
more
complete
control
and
jurisdiction
of
our
national
executive
than
they
would
be
in
the
everglades,
because
there
are
no
federalism
constraints
here.
our
national
government
supplies
the
only
law.
and
if
they
were
detained
in
germany,
the
question
would
be
a,
are
they
being
detained
by
the
united
states
or
by
some
multinational
coalition
force
as
was
the
case,
for
example,
in
hirota.
b,
are
there
other
laws,
or
can
they
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
another
court?
and
the
answer
to
that
question
would
depend
upon
the
terms
of
our--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
answer
to
that
is
a
resounding
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
are
the
cases
that
were
discussed
and
cited
by
the
majority
opinion
in
rasul,
and
we
have...
we
have
added
other
ones
to
them,
but
it's
showing--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
the
opinion
of
two
of
the
three
law
lords
in
the
earl
of
crewe,
which
the
majority
cited
as
in
re
sekgome.
it
is
certain...
the
government
concedes
it
was
the
case
in
mwenya.
it
was
true
in
the
indian
cases.
and,
in
fact,
as
we
point
out--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--indeed,
it
did.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
indeed,
it
did,
and
the
government--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
no...
let
me
take
a
shot
at
convincing
you
that
it's
not
totally
irrelevant.
the
crown
counsel
in
that
case,
in
his
brief,
stated
forthrightly
that
subjecthood
or
citizenship
didn't
matter
and,
in
fact,
in
the
very
minority
opinion
that
the
government
relies
on
in
its
brief
here
in
earl
of
crewe,
lord
justice
kennedy
specifically
said
that
the
citizenship
is
irrelevant.
it
isn't
and
wasn't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
court
majority
in
rasul
cites
a
case
involving
the
isle
of
jersey,
the
channel
islands.
none
of
those
were
within
the
sovereign
courts'--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'll
take
one
more
chance,
justice
scalia.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
here
they
go.
in
the
indian
cases...
i
mean,
first
of
all,
let's
say
that
citizenship
was
not
a
notion
at
common
law.
the
question
was
subjecthood,
and
subjecthood
was
a
very
ill-defined
term
that
had
no
fixed
parameters,
as
our
reply
brief
points
out.
certainly
many
of
the
petitioners
in
the
indian
cases
that
we
cited...
and
in
fact
that
sir
john
chambers
decided...
were
not
englishmen
or
people
who
would
have
been
otherwise
considered--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
as
lord
mansfield
explained
in
the
king
v.
cowle,
and
both
sides
are
citing
to
it...
even
if
the
writ...
even
with
respect
to
the
persons
detained
outside
the
english
realm,
the
relevant
question
was,
is
this
person
under
the
subjection
of
the
crown?
not
what
is
the
subjecthood
or
citizenship
of
this
person?
and
in
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
answer
that
question
directly
and
then
if
i
may
finish
my
answer
to
justice
scalia.
we
don't
contend
that
the
united
states
exercises
sovereignty
over
guantanamo
bay.
our
contention
is
that
at
common
law,
sovereignty
(a)
wasn't
the
test,
as
lord
mansfield
explained,
and
(b)
wasn't
a
clear-cut
determine...
there
weren't
clear-cut
sovereignty
lines
in
those
days.
our
case
doesn't
depend
on
sovereignty.
it
depends
on
the
fact
that,
among
other
things,
the
united
states
exercises...
quote...
"complete
jurisdiction
and
control
over
this
base.
"
no
other
law
applies.
if
our
law
doesn't
apply,
it
is
a
law-free
zone.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
i
think,
justice
alito,
i
want
to
be
as
clear
about
this
as
i
can
be.
this
is
a
particularly
easy
straightforward
case,
but
in
another
place,
jurisdiction
would
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances,
including
the
nature
of
an
agreement
with
the
resident
sovereign
over
who
exercises
control.
and
i
want
to
come
back
to
that
with
the
japan
and
german
example,
because
i
have
read
the
status
of
forces
agreements
there.
secondly,
even
if
there
technically
were
jurisdiction,
there
might
very
well
be
justiciability
issues
under
the
circumstances
of
the
sort
that
justice
kennedy
addressed
in
his
concurrence
in
rasul;
that
is,
there
may
be
circumstances
and
temporal
conditions
in
which,
under
the
separation
of
powers,
it
would
be
a...
a
court
would
deem
it
inappropriate
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
and
finally,
even
if
it
were
appropriate
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction,
the
review
of
a
habeas
court
in
the
mine
run
of
cases
would
be
anything
but
plenary
because
members
of
enemy
armed
forces
and
enemy
aliens
within
the
meaning
of
the
alien
enemy
act
are
detainable.
period.
now,
with
respect
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
if
they
were
in
the
united
states,
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
could
file
a
habeas
petition.
and,
you
know,
the
question
about
how
guantanamo
relates
to
that
is
for
this
court.
what's
material
is
that...
i
mean
we
cited
to
the
court
the
army
directives
and
the
army
procedures
implementing
article
v
of
the
geneva
conventions
that
were
used
in
vietnam,
which
is
the
only
other
war
we
engaged
in
that
had
combatants
who
weren't
in
uniforms.
they
not
only
had
a
hearing
that
was
near
the
time
and
near
the
place
of
capture
and
the
right
to
call
witnesses;
there's
no
evidence
that
classified
information
was
withheld
from
them.
and
they
not
only
had
a
right
to
counsel;
the
government
provided
them
counsel,
somebody
who
was
their
advocate.
now,
once
a
determination
like
that
is
made,
they
may...
if
they're
detained
in
the
united
states...
they
may
file
a
habeas
petition
and
the
response
will
be
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
not
to
defer
to
the
adjudication
of
that
tribunal.
you
have,
as
i
started
with
the
chief
justice,
you
had
a
fair
notice
of
the
facts,
a
fair
opportunity
to
challenge
them
with
the
assistance
of
counsel
before
a
neutral
decisionmaker.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
don't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
know,
i
think...
both
sides
try
to
derive
force
from
the
fact
that
such
claims,
such
habeas
petitions,
haven't
come
forward
in
floods
in
the
past.
i
think
the
reason
is
that,
in
the
past,
we
had
combat
in
which...
you
know...
i
mean
in
a
war
of
the
conventional
sort,
soldiers
wear
uniforms,
and
more
to
the
point,
the
interests
of
the
captured
soldier
and
the
command...
and
the
capturing
officer
are
aligned.
the
captured
soldier
wants
to
be
treated
as
a
prisoner
of
war
or
released.
the
commanding
general
wants
to
release
civilians
who
aren't
in
the
army
or
turn
them
over
for
criminal
prosecution.
that's
why,
in
the
gulf
war,
there
were
1200...
roughly,
just
a
few
hundred,
1200
article
v
field
tribunal
hearings
that
were
held,
of
which
almost
900
were
released
as
civilian
non-combatants
and
the
remaining
were
detained--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
first
of
all,
there
is
colepaugh--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there's...
there
are
colepaugh,
the
tenth
circuit
case
and
in
re:
territo,
both
of
which
we
discussed.
but
more
to
the
point,
as
i
said,
justice
scalia,
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
member
of
the
german
army
or
somebody
who
is
assisting
the
german
army...
it
would
be
totally
unavailing
to
file
a...
to
file
a
habeas
petition
because
they
are
detainable.
it
would
be
like
mr.
ludekey
in
the
united
states
v.
ludekey
saying--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
were
provided
article
v
tribunals
that
gave
them
actual
notice
of
the
government's
facts
and
actual
opportunity
to
controvert
it
and
a
determination
by
military
officers
who
had
not
been
told
that
both
the
commanding
general
of
the
southern
command
and
the
secretary
of
defense
had
personally
reviewed
the
evidence
and
determined
that
these
were
enemy
combatants;
and
a
habeas
court
would
simply
dismiss.
and
a
habeas
court
could
simply
say
whether
we
do
or
don't
technically
have
jurisdiction
under
battlefield
circumstances
or
circumstances
involving
foreign
detainees
in
a
zone
of
occupation
where
active
hostilities
occur,
it
is
inappropriate
under
the
separation
of
powers
for
us
to
intervene.
but
these
men
have
been
held,
taken
by
the
united
states,
thousands
of
miles
away...
in
the
case
of
my
six
individuals,
plucked
from
their
homes,
from
their
wives
and
children
in
sarajevo,
detained
for
three
months
at
the
united
states
request.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
we've
asked
that
they
be
granted
habeas
relief.
we
think
what
that
means
is
that
they
should
be...
the
cases
should
be
returned
to
the
district
courts
where
their
cases
are
proceeding.
the
government
has
filed
its
factual
returns
to
the
writ.
judge
green,
in
the
cases
pending
before
her,
has
established
procedures
to
protect
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
would
argue
that
the
answer
is
no
for
two
reasons.
the
one
because
there
is
no
prospect,
no
prospect
that
the
dta
proceedings
will
be
conducted
with
alacrity
or
certainty;
and
second
of
all--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--here's...
the...
the...
let's
take
the
cases
in
front
of
judge
green.
judge
leon
in
the
cases
of
my
client
just
granted
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss.
but
in
all
of
the
cases
the
government
has
filed
its
factual
return
under
the
procedures,
under
the
long-established
habeas
procedures
under
2243.
it
is...
the
burden
is
now
on
us.
she
has
already
ruled
that
with
respect
to
secret
information
or
classified
information,
here
are
the
safeguards
that
will
govern,
here's
how
we
will
work.
and
it
is
simply
on
us
now
to
adduce
and
present
evidence
to
try
and
over...
to
try
to
shoulder
the
burden
we
have.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
justice
kennedy,
the
government,
after
two
years,
has
not
produced
the
record
on
review
in
a
single
case.
it
has
now
said...
two
years.
it
has
now
said
that
it
cannot
do
so,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
suggested
that
what
the
government
ought
to
do
is
hold
entirely
new
csrt
proceedings.
now,
those
proceedings
are
structurally
flawed.
perhaps
this
court
could
say,
look,
here's
how
it's
going
to
be.
first
of
all,
the
constitution
does
apply.
second
of
all,
we
have
to
have
a
hearing
in
which
the
following
things
occur.
we
either
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
all
writs
act
or
under
28
usc
section
2347c...
the
petitioners
have
to
have
the
right
to
adduce
and
present
evidence
to
controvert
the
government's
return
which
was...
almost
all
of
the
government's
evidence
was
introduced
ex
parte,
in
camera,
and
with
a...
to
boot
with
a
presumption
that
it
is
accurate
and
genuine.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
don't...
it
could
if
the
military
had
different
procedures
to
govern
the
csrts.
and
our
submission
is
that
with
respect
to
these
petitioners,
you've
asked
to
hold
aside
the
six
years.
i
would
say
with
respect
to
future
detainees,
that
this
court
could
issue
a
ruling...
well,
this
court
should
issue
a
ruling
saying
for
these
people
if
the
writ
means
anything,
the
time
for
experimentation
is
over.
we
have
tried
and
true
established
procedures.
we've
got
experienced
district
judges
including
a
judge
who
was
the
chief
judge
in
the
fisa
court,
who's
already
established
the
rules
for
maintaining
confidentiality
of
classified
information.
but
we
are
not
as
a
court
saying
that
there
could
not
readily
be
an
adequate
substitute
if
the
administrative
procedures
generated
by
the
department
of
defense
allowed
for
the
process
minimums
that
the
chief
justice
asked
me
about
at
the
beginning
and
advocated
a
standard
that
was
authorized...
a
substantive
standard
authorized
by
the
aumf.
dta
review
may
very
well
be
an
adequate
substitute.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
certainly
think
so.
but
at
a
minimum,
justice
souter,
you
would
have
to
have
the
kind
of
tribunal
that
is
called
for
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
where
you
don't
have
the
convening
authority
exercising
command
control
over
the
tribunal
officer.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
certainly
don't
think
it
would
be
unless
this
court
clarified
under
the...
i
don't
know
whether
this
would
fall
under
the
guise
of
clarification;
but
specify
that
under
the
circumstances,
the
deferential
review
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
which
it
presumes
accurate
and
presumes
sufficient...
adequate
the
evidence
which
the
tribunal
itself
presumed
accurate
would
have
to
fall;
that
is,
a
habeas
court
would
never
accord
that
presumption.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
will
cite
two
examples.
i
knew
that
there
was
one
other
thing
i
wanted
to
try
on
justice
scalia.
one
is...
and
it's
referenced
in
our
footnote...
you
know,
in
1777
and
1783,
parliament
suspended
the
privilege
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
people
on
the
high
seas
or
out
of
the
realm,
specifically
directed
at
u.s.
seamen,
at
american
seamen.
and
if
the
writ
never
extended
to
american
seamen
on
the
high
seas
or
out
of
the
realm,
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
suspending
it.
second
of
all,
the
common...
the
high
court
judges
who
were
administering...
issuing
the
writ
for
the
benefit
of
detainees
in
india
before
it
became
a
sovereign
possession
were
not
exercising
a
statutory
authority,
with
all
due
respect
to
justice
scalia.
there
was
a
royal
charter
that
granted
those
judges
the...
all
of
the
common...
the
authority...
common
law
authorities
of
the
queen's
bench.
and
as
the
indian
case
law
explicates,
and
sir
john
chambers
explains,
one
of
those
authorities
was
the
exercise
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
not
mandamus,
outside
territories
that
were
no
part
of
the
realm
of
england.
those
are
the,
i
think...
i
mean
there
may
be
be
something
in--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
in
this...
in
this
country,
in
re
felateau,
which
was
decided
only
a
few
years
after
the
founding,
not
only
was
he
an
enemy
alien;
he
was
granted
release
under
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
because,
not
being
a
citizen,
he
could
not
be
charged
with
treason,
which
was
the
basis
for
holding
him.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
in
pennsylvania.
maybe
it
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
was
the
mid-atlantic.
excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
scalia,
you're
asking
me
to
discard
the
indian
cases,
and
i've...
i've
mentioned
to
you
the
cases
that
the
majority
of
indians
in
rasul
relied
on,
the
earl
of
crewe
and
mwenya.
i've
given
you
the
two
statutes.
i
think
at
this
point
i
have
to
plead
exhaustion
from
remedies.
[laughter]
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
my...
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record
here,
but
what
is
in
the
record
are
the
terms
of
the
lease.
and
i
don't
really
take
it
to
be
disputed
that
guantanamo
is
under
the
complete,
utterly
exclusive,
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
national
government
of
the
united
states.
that's
in
the
lease,
itself.
the
courts
of
cuba
have
so
held.
they
have
designated
guantanamo,
quote,
"foreign
territory"
unless
and
until
the
united
states
in
its
sole
discretion
chooses
to
vacate
the
base.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
not
sure
whether
there
are,
or
not,
any
longer.
but
unlike...
or
if
you
take...
they
are
not
subject...
and
it
has
never
been
contended
that
they
are
subject...
to
cuban
control
with
respect
to
conduct
that
is
subject
to
any
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
absolutely
not,
and
this
is
the
key
difference,
i
think,
going
to
justice
alito's
question.
under
our
established--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
first
of
all,
the
terms
of
the
lease,
and,
second
of
all,
i...
i
don't
know
that
we
cited...
i
mean,
somebody
has
cited
decisions
of
the
cuban
government,
the
judiciary
and
its
executive,
that
they
don't
exercise
any
jurisdiction
over--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
answer
is
certainly
yes,
and
if
i
can
just
make
the
point
about
bases
elsewhere,
in
germany
and
japan,
for
example,
the
status
of...
this
is
the
only
base,
i
believe,
that...
you
know,
in
something
other
than
an
active
war
zone,
that
isn't
the
subject
of
a
status-of-forces
agreement
that
very
specifically
explicates
both
the
judicial
and
executive
authority
over
acts
that
occur
on
the
base.
and,
for
example,
under
our
status-of-forces
agreement
with
japan,
it
is
entirely
clear
that
if
it
is
a
japanese
citizen
or
a
japanese
national
or
conduct
that
is
subject
to
the
laws
of
japan,
the
japanese
courts
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
not
particularly.
let's
put
it
this
way:
it
has
not
occurred
to
us
yet.
[laughter]
i
mean,
this
is
in...
this
is
in
many
respects
a
uniquely
straightforward
case.
i
really
didn't
mean
to
be
facetious
when
i
said
our
national
control
over
guantanamo
is
greater
than
it
is
over
a
place
in
kentucky,
because
there
we
have...
under
our
system
of
federalism
the
federal
government
has
limited
controls.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
i
think
that's
right,
and
i
also
think
that,
although
it
is
correct,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
at
the
outset,
that
the
decision
in
rasul
was
a
decision
about
the
scope
of
2241,
which
has
now
been
amended,
and
the
majority,
at
least,
rendered
a
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
statute,
nonetheless,
the
court
was
construing
2241(c)(1),
which
is
in
haec
verba
with
section
14
of
the
1789
act.
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
habeas
statute
like
the
civil
war
provisions
that...
under
which
this
court
reviews
state
court
convictions
and
detentions.
but
the
statute
that
this
court
was
construing
in
rasul
was
identical
in
language
to
the
one
promulgated
in
the...
the
very
first
judiciary
act
of
1789,
which
this
court
has
said
in
bollman
was
an
instantiation,
a
positive
enactment
of
the
writ,
that
was
protected
by
the
constitution.
and
so,
while
technically,
the
majority
was
issuing
a
statutory
ruling...
and
we
don't
contend
otherwise...
inferentially,
its
conclusion
must
extend
to
the...
the
extent
of
the
writ
at
common
law.
thank
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
want
to
speak
mostly
about
the
adequacy
of
the
substitute
and
particularly
the
question
that
you
and
justice
kennedy
asked
about
adjudication
of
the
standard
on
remand,
but
just
to
take
first
things
first,
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
i've
ever
seen
the
government's...
the
case
liverridge
or
green
cases
cited
by
the
government
before.
and
i
don't
know
what
they
say.
but
it
is
absolutely
incorrect
that
dta
review
of
the
csrts
is
a
liberalization
of
the
traditional
writ.
as
this
court
made...
or
the
king's
bench
made
clear
in
the
bushell's
case
and
all
of
the
commentators
including
sharpe,
who
both
sides
are
citing
as
authoritative,
here
agree
in
cases
of
executive
detention,
where
there
wasn't
a
trial
occurring,
the
court
absolutely
could...
the
prisoner
could
controvert
the
facts
of
the
return
in
schiever
and
spanish
citizens...
spanish
prisoners,
there
wasn't
an
original
hearing
because
the
court
issued...
sat
as
nisi
prius
court
and
considered
affidavits
of
the
prisoners
and
third
parties
and
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavits
that
they
were
prisoners
of
war.
but
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
writ
did
extend
to
the
question
of
"i
am
not
a
combatant.
"
"i
am
not
a
warrior,
number
one.
"
"and
number
two,
it
did
go
in
non-criminal
detentions
to
the
underlying
facts
of
the
detention,
and
that
goes
to
the
point
about
the
standard
that
justice
kennedy
asked
and
the
chief
justice
asked.
"
"we
agree
that,
if
and
when
the
d.c.
circuit
ever
addresses
the
merits
of
these
cases,
and
not
only
is
there
no
csr...
complete
record
on
return
in
any
case,
but
the
government
has
suggested
they
proceed
five
at
a
time,
and
we're
now
two
years
running
without
a
single
one...
but
there's
no
doubt
that
the
argument
we're
making
in
roman
numeral
2
of
our
brief,
that
the
csr,
the
wolfowitz
definition
is
not
authorized
detention
under
the
aumf,
which
as
this
court
in
hamdi
said,
incorporates
long-established
law-of-war
principles
and
american
traditions.
"
"we
can
raise
that
claim
because
they
have
to
establish
that
the
procedures
and
standards
were
consistent
not
only
with
the
constitution
but
also
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
"
"and
the
problem
this
is
this--
"
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
but
what...
what
habeas
at
its
core
was...
and
we're
talking...
i'm
happy
to
live
in
the
world
of
1789
now...
is
executive
detention
and
not
the
more
modern
innovations
where,
well,
certain
procedures
weren't
constitutional
or
whatever,
but
you
have
no
right
to
hold
me.
the
facts
won't
allow
you
to
hold
me.
the
d.c.
circuit
cannot--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--because
the
d.c.
circuit...
because
the
d.c.
circuit
is
reviewing
a
record
that
was
adduced
ex
parte,
in
camera,
with
a
presumption
to
boot
that
it
is...
that
the
evidence
is
both
accurate
and
complete,
and
the
d.c.
circuit
is...
has
already
said
it
will
not
hear
any
new
evidence
and
it
must
apply
that
same
presumption
that
that
evidence
that
was
heard
ex
parte
in
camera
with
its
own
presumption
is
correct.
and
here's...
let
me
just
give
you
an
example
of
what
difference
this
makes.
you
have
the
unredacted
version
of
judge
green's
district
court
opinion.
i
don't.
she
discusses...
she
does
address
the
adequacy
of
the
substitute.
and
she
addresses
the
case
of
two
individuals.
one
is
mr.
ait-idir,
who
is
my
client,
and
you
have
both
in
her
opinion
and
our
brief
this
truly
kafka-esque
colloquy
at
his
hearing
in
which
he
is
accused
of
associating
with
a
known
al-qaeda
operative,
which
he
denies,
but
he
can't
be
told
the
name.
mr.
kurnaz
is
the
other
petitioner
who
is
discussed
in
her
brief.
he
was
a
petitioner
in
this
court,
but
he
has
since
been
released
by
the
government
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
what
the
csrts
won't
give
him,
which
is
a
lawyer.
he
was
told,
two
years
after
he
was
detained...
he's
a
german
permanent
resident...
he
was
told
at
his
csrt,
as
many
of
these
individuals
were
not,
that
he
was
being
held
because
he
associated
with
a
known
terrorist.
and
he
was
told
the
name.
he
was
told
that
he
associated
with
somebody
called
selcook
bilgen
who,
the
government
contended,
was
(a)
a
terrorist,
who
was...
had
blown
himself
up
while
mr.
kurnaz
was
in
detention...
may
i
simply
finish
this
account...
while
he
was
in
detention
and
in
a
suicide
bombing;
and
all
that
mr.
kurnaz
could
say
at
his
csrt
where
he
had
no
lawyer
and
had
no
access
to
information
was
i
never
had
any
reason
to
suspect
he
was
a
terrorist.
well,
when
the
government,
in
the
habeas
proceedings,
filed
its
factual
return
in
judge
green's
court,
it
filed
as
its
factual
return
the
csrt
record.
his
counsel
saw
that
accusation.
within
24
hours,
his
counsel
had
affidavits
not
only
from
the
german
prosecutor
but
from
the
supposedly
deceased
mr.
bilgen,
who
is
a
resident
of
dresden
never
involved
in
terrorism
and
fully
getting
on
with
his
life.
that's
what...
and
that
evidence
would
not
have
been
allowed
in
under
dta
review.
it
wouldn't
have
been
in
the
csrt,
and
it
won't
come
in
under
dta
review.
and
that's
why
it
is
inadequate.
