mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
this
court's
decision
in
rasul,
petitioners'
status
has
been
reviewed
by
a
tribunal
modeled
on
army
regulation
190-8,
and
congress
has
passed
two
statutes
addressing
petitioners'
rights.
petitioners
now
have
access
to
the
article
iii
courts
and
have
a
right
to
judicial
review
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
that
review
encompasses
preponderance
claims,
claims
that
the
military
did
not
follow
their
own
regulations,
and
statutory
and
constitutional
claims.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
it
is
virtually
identical.
if
you
look
at
pages
50
and
51
of
our
brief,
you'll
see
kind
of
a
side-by-side
comparison;
and
the
deviations
are
ones
that,
we
would
submit,
enhance
the
rights
of
the
detainees
in
this
particular
circumstance.
so
they
are
given
a
right
to
a
personal
representative,
which
is
not
something
that
army
regulation
190-8
provides.
they
are
specifically
provided
for
the
ability
to
submit
documentary
evidence.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
personal
representative
is
assigned
to
the
individual
by
the
military.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
know
about
"unfavorable",
but
i
think
if
there's...
certainly,
if
there
is
material
intelligence
information,
he
is
to
provide
that
information.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
we
are
not
trying
to
make
the
point
that
the
personal
representative
is
a
counsel.
we're
just
saying
it
is
something
that
is
provided
above
and
beyond
190-8
in
terms
of
the
procedure;
and
there
are
other
particulars
as
well,
like
there
is
the
notice
of
the
charges
in
the
unclassified
summaries
that
are
provided.
now,
there's
the
complaint
on
the
other
side
that
the
unclassified
summaries
aren't
particular
enough,
but
it
is
worth
noting
that
that's
something
that
is
provided
here
that's
not
specified
by
190-8.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
they
do
not,
not
under
the
basic
regulations
of
that.
now,
mr.
waxman
correctly
indicated
that
in
a
particular
instance
in
vietnam,
counsel
was
provided
in
190-8
proceedings,
but
those
are
not
provided
by
the
basic
190-8
procedures.
and,
i
think
it
is
worth--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i...
the
way
i
would
answer
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
this:
in
terms,
the
dta
does
not
provide
for
an
order
of
release.
and
we
would
certainly
have
taken
the
position
that,
as
a
first
order,
if
the
d.c.
circuit
finds
a
defect
in
the
cstr,
we
think
the
proper
remedy
would
be
to
order
a
remand
for
a
new
cstr.
but,
certainly,
if
this
court
thinks
that
the
constitutional
line
is...
essentially
necessitates
that
the
d.c.
circuit
have
the
authority
to
order
a
release,
there
is
no
obstacle
to
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
and
the
d.c.
circuit
would
have
available
to
it
the
all
writs
act,
and
the
d.c.
circuit,
in
fact,
in
its
desmoula
decision,
which
is
the
decision
where
the
government
has
filed
an
en
banc
petition...
that
protective
order
that
was
issued
there
was
done
pursuant
to
the
all
writs
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
d.c.
circuit
hasn't
been
shy
about
asserting
that
authority.
and,
again,
if
that's
what
was
required
here,
they
could
use
that
authority
to
order
a
release.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
"uigars".
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
would
disagree,
justice
souter.
let
me
say
a
couple
of
things
to
that.
one
is
that
i
think
with
respect
to
the
uigars,
in
particular,
there
was
a
problem
with
ordering
release
outright.
and
it
is
interesting
that
when
judge
robertson,
the
same
judge,
district
court
judge,
who
decided
the
hamdan
case,
had
before
him
one
of
the
uigars
in
a
habeas
petition,
he
recognized
that
under
habeas
he
couldn't
order
release.
and
the
problem
wasn't
any
kind
of
inherent
limitation
on
what
he
could
order
in
his
jurisdiction.
there
was
just
a
practical
problem,
which
was--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
again,
justice
souter,
what
i
would
say
is
simply
this:
that
if
what
the
constitution
requires
to
make
the
dta
to
be
an
adequate
substitute
is
the
power
to
order
release,
there
is
no
obstacle
in
the
text
of
the
dta
to
that.
and
the
all
writs
act
is
available
to
allow
them
to
order
release
to
protect
their
jurisdiction
under
the
dta.
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
solution
to
that
problem.
now,
i
think,
more
broadly,
let
me...
let
me
say
about
the
dta
and
the
mca,
it
really
does
represent
the
best
efforts
of
the
political
branches,
both
political
branches,
to
try
to
balance
the
interest
in
providing
the
detainees
in
this
admittedly
unique
situation
additional
process
with
the
imperative
to
successfully
prosecute
the
global
war
on
terror.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
not
sure
that
he
could
make
that
argument.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
not
sure
he
can
make--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
take
it
this
way,
which
is,
of
course,
you're
getting
to
the
gravamen
of
their
claim,
which
is
that
the
dta
and
the
review
provided
in
the
d.c.
circuit
is
not
an
adequate
substitute
for
habeas
review.
and
i'll
start
with
the
assumption
for
a
second,
which
i
hope
is
right,
because
it
seems
that
judge
friendly
reached
this
conclusion...
and
it
seems
to
me
the
right
conclusion...
which
is
that
the
base
line
is
1789.
and
if
you
compare
what
these
detainees
have
under
the
dta
in
terms
of
judicial
review
to
what
would
have
been
available
to
them
at
common
law
in
1789,
it
is
not
even
close.
this
is
the
remarkable
liberalization
of
the
writ,
not
some
retrenchment
or
suspension
of
the
writ.
these
detainees
at
common
law
would
face
not
one,
but
three
obstacles,
to
getting
into
court
to
make
these
claims.
the
first,
of
course,
is
the
geographical
limits
on
the
reach
of
the
writ.
the
second,
but
equally
important,
is
the
line
of
authority
that
says
that
the
writ
was
simply
unavailable
to
prisoners
of
war.
and
the
third
problem
would
be
the
well-established
common
law
rule
that
you
can't
controvert
the
facts
as
set
forth
in
the
return.
so
at
common
law,
somebody
who
took
the
incredibly,
i
think,
poor
strategic
call
to
concede
all
of
their
legal
arguments
away
and
say
only:
i
have
a
constitutional
claim
here
to
be
brought,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
gotten
into
court
with
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
not
at
all--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--not
at
all,
justice
souter.
and,
first
of
all...
i
mean,
i
take
it
your...
your
principal
objection
goes
to
the
geographical
writ
point,
because
i
think
that
the
issues
about
controverting
the
facts
of
the
return
and
the
availability
of
the
writs
to
prisoners
of
war
is
something
that
really
wasn't...
had
any
reason
to
be
before
this
court
in
rasul.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
souter--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
souter...
because
i
think
it
gets
to
the
same
point...
we
are
using
"prisoner
of
war"
the
way
that
the
common
law
courts
use
the
term
"prisoner
of
war".
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and...
and...
with
respect,
the
framers
in
1789
had
the
benefit
of
the
three
spanish
soldiers
and
the
schiever
case.
they
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
the
geneva
convention.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
writ
was
denied,
justice
souter.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
the
writ
was
denied.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
did
not
have
a
hearing.
the
writ
was--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because
it
said
that...
it
looked
at
the
pleading
in
the
petition.
there
was
no
hearing.
it
looked
at
the
petition
and
it
said:
on
their
own
showing,
they
are
prisoners
of
war.
they
are
denied
the
writ.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
didn't
even
ask
for
a
return,
justice
souter.
i
mean...
you
know,
they
decided
the
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there
is
authority
for
that
proposition,
justice
souter.
it
comes
along
later
in
the
world
war
ii
cases
in
britain.
the
reason
there's
not
authority
contemporaneous
with
the
1759
cases
is
because
these
courts
are
operating
with
the
common-law
rule
you
can't
controvert
the
facts
as
set
forth
in
a
return.
so
the
petitioners
in
these
cases
wisely
didn't
make
a
factual
dispute;
they
made
a
legal
dispute.
and
the
courts
rejected
it
time
and
time
again.
i
thought
the
spanish
sailors
and
the
shiver...
i'd
like
to
just
offer
you
that
the
1941
authority...
because
this
question
of
course,
over
time,
by
1941,
the
british
courts
have
relaxed
the
rule
against
controverting
the
facts
of
the
return,
and
they
addressed
this
question
about
what
kind
of
factual
inquiry
is
necessary
when
the
government
comes
back
and
says
that
somebody
is
an
enemy
combatant,
a
prisoner
of
war,
or,
under
the
emergency
detention
act
of
1939,
a
threat
to
the
realm.
and
in
two
cases,
liverridge
against
anderson
and
green
against
anderson,
the
law
lords,
in
1941,
say
that
they
are
not
going
to
look
beyond
what
the
government
has
provided
in
the
return.
they're
not
even,
in
the
green
case,
going
to
ask
for
an
affidavit.
so
if
you're
looking--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
is
a
pretty
good
snapshot
of
where
things
were
as
of
1941.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
were
exercising
habeas
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
we
do
have
an
answer,
justice
souter.
it
is
in
the
liverridge
case,
because
there
there's
a
question
of
interpreting
the
emergency
detention
act.
and
they
basically
have
a
choice.
they
can
interpret
it
to
allow
the
detention
to
turn
exclusively
on
the
subjective
belief
of
the
home
secretary,
or
they
can
interpret
it
to
reflect
an
objective
standard.
and
they
choose,
over
the
dissent
of
lord
atkins,
they
choose
purely
subject
if
standard.
so
in
interpreting
a
act
of
parliament
that
could
have
gone
either
way
they
interpreted
under
the
common
law
writ
to
involve
no
factual
inquiry
whatsoever.
and
the
case
at
common
law
in
1789
is
a
fortiori
from
that
because
they
would
not
go
beyond
the
facts
as
set
forth
in
the
return.
and
the
only
response
the
petitioners
have
to
that
common
law
rule
is
they
can
point
to
a
couple
of
cases
where
the
courts
were
tempted
and
did
accede
to
the
temptation
to
peek
beyond
the
return
in
the
context
of
a
child
custody
case
or
private
custody
cases.
but
this
is
a
situation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--as
justice
souter
pointed
out...
i
mean,
if
you
assume
that
the
statute
also
said
any
review
for
that
claim
should
be
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
in
the
traditional--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
as
i
say,
i
think
that
if
you
accept
that
there
would
be
some
deference
to
the
ability
to
bring
statutory
claims,
i
don't
know
why
that
deference
would
be
limited
to
the
substance
and
not
to
the
forum.
and
congress
here
has
spoken.
it
has
spoken.
the
political
branch
has
spoken.
they
have
struck
a
balance.
they've
given
these
detainees
better
rights
and
access
to
administrative
and
judicial
review.
anyone--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
government
will
certainly
take
the
position
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
those
things.
presumably
the
petitioners
will
be
arguing
they
are
entitled
to
those
things.
the
answers
to
those
questions
will
be
unclear
because
the
review
provided
by
the
dta
and
the
habeas
statute,
if
it
is
applied
in
this
context,
either
way,
whatever
the
vehicle
for
that
judicial
review,
it
will
be
unprecedented.
and
there
will
be
difficult
questions
that
will
need
to
be
worked
out,
and
i
don't
understand
why--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--not
as
such,
justice
scalia.
now,
of
course,
we
might
have
an
argument
as
to
some
of
these
individuals,
that
they
engaged
in
unlawful--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right,
and
the
ones
that
actually
killed
somebody
would
have
committed
murder.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
don't
qualify
for
prisoner
of
war
status,
but
just
to
be
clear
i
think
certainly
when
the
british
cases
are
talking
about--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they
would
not
qualify
for
prisoner
of
war
status.
they're
enemy
combatants--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
would
be
our
theory
in
those
cases--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
would
be
our
theory
in
those
cases...
and
it
is
our
theory
in
those
cases
we've
chosen
to
prosecute--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
the
military
commissions,
but
there
are
other
individuals
with
respect
to
whom
we
don't
have
the
right
kind
of
evidence
in
order
to
go
with
the
full-blown
military
commission
trial,
but
we
still
have
the
option
that
this
court
recognized
in
kirin
and
hamdi
and
most
particularly
in
kirin,
not
just
to
try
people
who
are
unlawful
combatants
for
their
unlawful
combatancy,
but
also
to
hold
them
as
we
would
hold
anybody
else
who
was
captured
as
preventative
detention.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
if
we
can
show
that
they
were
enemy
combatants,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
than?
i'm
sorry?
broader
than
what?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
two
things,
justice
souter.
one
thing
is
that
with
respect
to
the
definition
that
the
military
commissions...
i'm
sorry...
that
the
c-cert
7
apply,
that
is
a
broader
definition,
i
would
quickly
add
though
that
with
respect
to
the
majority
of
individuals...
i
mean
you
have
the
petitioners
from
bosnia
that
mr.
waxman
represents,
but
most
of
these
people
were
seized
in
pakistan
and
afghanistan,
and
so
the
situation
is
not
that
different.
and
obviously
we
would
take
the
position
to
the
extent
you
have
some
concerns
about
the
breadth
of
the
definition,
what
this
court...
what
the
plurality
said
in
hamdi
in
footnote
1
gets
it
exactly
right.
the
way
to
deal
with
those
concerns
is
in
the
adjudication
of
particular
cases
which
can
take
place
under
the
dta
or
can
take
place
in
habeas.
and
again
i
think
the
burden--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
it
does
not.
i
mean
it's
a
regulatory--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
was
in
my
points,
justice
souter.
so
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
absolutely
is.
i
think
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
was
cleverly
crafted,
though,
to
take
that
off
the
table.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think,
again,
that
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
as
i
understood
it,
sort
of
assumed
away
the
adequacy
of
all
of
the
standards
and
just
said:
putting
all
of
that
to
one
side,
i
have
some
other
constitutional
claim.
and
i'm
just
not
so
sure
that
habeas
ever
allowed
you
to
sort
of
bring
every
claim
that
you
possibly
wanted
to;
and
i
think
the...
what
i...
the
way
i
read
this
court's
hamdi
decision
is
what
was
envisioned
on
a
habeas
case
in
a
case
where
army
regulation
190-8,
which,
of
course,
the
plurality
cited,
was
complied
with.
it
was
in
that
case:
the
habeas
petition
in
court
would
take
that
as
a
starting
point,
and
that
you
wouldn't
necessarily
be
able
to
say:
look,
it
was
nice
that
we
had
that
proceeding,
but
put
that
to
one
side.
i
have
another
claim.
i
don't
think
the
court,
even
in
habeas,
would
have
envisioned
that
that
would
go
forward.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
justice
kennedy.
that
would
be
available
to
them
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
is
our
position.
i
mean
i
want
to
give
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
its
due.
i
mean
there
might
be
claims
that
you
could
have
brought,
hypothetical
claims
that
you
could
have
brought
at
some
level,
and
that
the
dta
does--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely,
justice
stevens.
but
that
question,
of
course,
can
be
considered
by
the
d.c.
circuit
on
review,
because
they're
specifically
entitled
to
a
preponderance
review
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
so
that's
a
claim
that
they
clearly
could
bring.
they
can
also
bring
the
statutory
and
constitutional
claims
to
the
standards
and
procedures,
and
they
can
make
claims
that
the
procedures
that
are
set
forth
in
the
csrts
are
not
provided.
and
i
think,
again,
if
you
compare
that
to
what
they
would
have
had
at
the
common
law,
and
you
ask
the
question--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
a
preponderance
standard,
and
that's
what
is
set
forth
in
the
statute.
and,
again,
that's
something
where
congress
specifically
got
involved
in
the
csrts
in
a
way
that
i
think
is
different
from
the
hamdan
case
and
congress's
involvement
with
the
military
commissions.
in
the
military
commissions--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
that's
why,
as
we
say
in
the
brief...
i
mean
there's
a
sense
in
which
this
is
really
a
facial
challenge.
i
mean,
in
order
for
them
to
prevail
with
the
argument
that
dta
review
is
an
inadequate
substitute,
they
really
have
to
say
that
it
is
inherently
an
inadequate
substitute.
that
no
matter
kind
of
how
many
times
the
d.c.
circuit
cuts
the
petitioner
a
break--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
the
delay
is
going
to
be
relevant
to
whether
or
not
courts
should
expedite
hearings,
and
the
like.
but
i
don't
think
it
should
cloud
the
basic
constitutional
question
before
this
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
of
course
not.
and
i
think
it
is
worth
recognizing
that
congress
legislated
in
this
area
not
in
year
one,
and
then
six
years
have
gone
by.
congress
legislated
with
these
particular
procedures
and
this
level
of
review
in
years
four
and
five.
and
the
fact
that
they
didn't
immediately
take
effect,
i
think,
is
not
an
accident.
it
is
a
product
of
the
fact
that
congress
in
this
area
was
providing
unprecedented
review.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and,
of
course,
when
you
do
something
unprecedented,
new
questions
will
arise.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that
is
our
position,
justice
ginsburg.
but
our
position
is
they
want...
they
styled
something...
they
filed
something
called
a
habeas
petition.
congress
subsequently
has
come
in
and
said:
the
way
we
are
going
to
deal
with
this
is
we
are
going
to
remove
jurisdiction
for
that
habeas
petition,
and
we're
going
to
allow
you
to
file
a
dta
review
provision...
a
dta
review
petition.
now,
their
argument
is
that
congress
can't
force
that
choice
on
them
because
this
is
an
inadequate
substitute
for
habeas.
the
suspension
clause
applies
in
guantanamo;
and
therefore,
the
dta
is
effectively
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
it
prevents
us
with
proceeding
with
our
habeas
petition.
now,
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
this
court
could
reject
that
claim.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
straightforward
way,
though,
is
to
simply
ask
the
question:
if
the
level
of
review
provided
by
the
dta
in
the
dta
petition
were
provided
by
statute
in
1789
or
even
1941,
for
that
matter,
would
it
have
been
seen
as
a
liberalization
of
the
writ,
or
a
contraction
and
suspension
of
the
writ?
and
i
think
it
is
very,
very
clear
that
if
this
statute
had
passed,
if
this
kind
of
review
was
provided
in
1789
or
in
1941,
it
would
have
been
greeted
as
a
remarkable...
remarkable
liberalization
of
the
writ
as
it
had
then
been
understood.
and
i
think
we
are
in
the
situation
where
these
individuals,
for
the
first
time,
are
really
allowed
this
kind
of
access
to
the
court
system.
and
when
that
happens,
there
are
going
to
be
difficult
questions.
we
have
difficult
questions
about
what
the
record
on
review
is.
we
have
difficult
questions
about
the
extent
to
which
classified
information
should
come
in.
but
all
of
those
difficult
questions
are
going
to
be
waiting
for
us
if
we
go
back
to
the
habeas
courts,
because
the
same
kind
of
issues--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
obviously
lower
courts
take
anything
this
court
says
very,
very
seriously.
so,
if
this
court
makes
it
clear--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean...
let
me...
if
i
could,
i
would
answer
it
as
to
what
this
court
should
say
about
what
the
d.c.
circuit
should
do
on
dta
review.
i
prefer
to
discuss
the
opinion
where
we
win
rather
than
the
opinion
where
we
lose.
as
to
that
opinion,
the
courts...
the
lower
courts
should
be
instructed
to
with
due
cognizance
for
the
fact
these
individuals
have
been
detained
six
years
and
this
is
the
process
that
has
been
provided
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
continuing
custody
is
lawful,
they
should
expedite
this
to
the
greatest
extent
possible.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect
if
you
win...
if
we
win,
you
still
write
an
opinion
saying
that
we
win,
and
that
opinion
can
still
say
everything--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--you
can
certainly
affirm
on
alternative
grounds.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
souter.
there
is
active
litigation
going
on
in
the
d.c.
circuit
over
basically
these
questions
and
how
this
litigation
is
going
to
take
place.
and
if
this
court
in
affirming
on...
begrudgingly
affirming
and
directing
the
d.c.
circuit
to
move
with
all
appropriate
dispatch,
that's
going
to
be
read
just
as
carefully
and
taken
just
as
seriously
if
it's
an
affirmance
than
if
it's
a
vacate
or
a
reversal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
hadn't
decided
that,
justice
souter.
that
might
have
been
a
problem
back
in
rasul.
but
now
whatever
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
provides
rights
in
guantanamo,
they
have
rights.
they
have
the
statutory
right
to
preponderance
review.
they
have
a
statutory
right
to
have
the
military
follow
its
own
procedures.
and
they
have
lots
of
arguments
in
the
lower
courts
trying
to
take
advantage
of
those
rights
that
they
have.
so
there
will
be
a
meaningful
procedure
in
the
d.c.
circuit--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
souter,
i'm
not
sure
that
this
court...
i
understand
your
question,
i
believe,
which
is
that
the
d.c.
circuit,
i
think,
almost
unavoidably
reading
this
court's
rasul
decision
and
reading
it
as
a
statutory
rather
than
a
constitutional
holding,
has
stuck
with
its
circuit
precedent
and
said
that
there
aren't
constitutional
rights
here.
that
is
going
to
be
true
unless
this
court
reverses
it
in
habeas
or
in
the
dta
review.
it
would
seem
particularly
strange
that
if
that's
the
real
problem
that
this
court
would
somehow
decide,
well,
you
know,
we
really
think
the
dta
is
an
adequate
substitute,
but
the
only
way
we
can
correct
this
other
mistake,
in
our
view,
that
the
d.c.
circuit
is
laboring
under
is
to
rule
against
the
government.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
i
think
that's
the
issue
before
this
court
now.
and
this
court,
for
example--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
sorry,
justice
souter,
i
may
have
misspoke.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
interesting
questions
that
i
think
are
left
on
the
remand,
no
matter
what,
are
issues
about
whether
or
not
based
on
the
abraham
declaration
that
the
military
followed
their
own
procedures
for
assembling
the
record
below,
or
whether
the
military
followed
its
own
procedures
for
providing
exculpatory
evidence.
those
are
all
questions
that
aren't
questions
that
require
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
eisentrager
is
still
good
law--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
i
want
to
be
clear
that
my
position
is
that
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance,
which
would
allow
this
court
to
address
some
of
those
questions,
is
that
the
d.c.
circuit
was
right
to
say
that
the
dta
review,
that
the
habeas
petition
should
be
dismissed.
the
reason
they
were
right
is
because
the
dta
is
an
adequate
substitute
for
habeas.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
a
fair
observation,
but
obviously
this
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
the
context...
i
mean
this
has
been
fully
briefed
in,
and
in
the
context
of
where
the
court
uses
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance,
it
would
not
be
a
novel
situation,
i
don't
think.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
a
fair
point,
justice
stevens,
though
i
would
say
that
really
their
reasoning
encapsulates
one
of
the
three
reasons
why
at
common
law
they
were
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
that's
right,
justice
stevens,
but
in
fairness,
in
those
situations
you
were
dealing
with
sort
of
substitutes
for
core
habeas
under
situations
where
they're
was
no
dispute
that
there
was
a
robust
right
to
habeas
at
common
law,
and
so
here
you
first
deal
with
the
situation
of...
all
right,
the
baseline
is,
as
judge
friendly
suggests,
1789,
is
this
an
adequate
substitute?
and
that
even
if
somehow...
and
i
don't
know
how
you
get
past
that...
then
you
i
think
still
might
ask
the
question
that
this
court
asked
in
the
felker
case,
which
is,
you
know,
giving
some
deference
to
congress's
ability
to
shape
the
scope
of
the
writ,
is
there
a
problem
here?
i
think
we
would
point
the
court
to
felker.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
is
part
of
our
point.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
we
would
say,
though--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--we
would
start
with
that
proposition,
but
i
think
this
isn't
a
case
where
it's
just
1789
versus
today
because
as
i
read
this...
2--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
a
hard
question
for
me
to
answer...
8--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
no,
but
i
mean
the
question
is,
you
know,
in
a
different
case,
sure,
there
would
be
a
different
habeas.
but
we
don't
know
sort
of
the
answer
as
to
what
habeas
looks
like
in
the
context
of
enemy
combatants
detained
in
a
place
like
guantanamo,
and
we
suggest,
based
on
our
best
reading
of
hamdi
that,
if
there
was
habeas
jurisdiction
now,
that
the
proceeding
that
would
unfold
would
not
be
the
plenary
habeas
that
is
envisioned
by
petitioners
but
would
be
a
much
more
narrowly
circumscribed
habeas.
i
would
also
point
out
that,
again,
it's
not
just--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
right.
i
would
say,
though,
that
our
only
baseline
is
not
1789
because,
as
we
read
this
court's
decision
in
rasul,
rasul
is
based
on
the
predicate
that
until
1973
and
braden's
overruling
of
ahrens,
that
the
habeas
statute
would
not
have
gone
to
guantanamo.
and
unless
this
court
is
willing
to
say
that
there
was
an
inchoate
suspension
clause
violation
until
1973
when
braden
comes
along,
it
seems
like
the
tradition
in
this
country
too,
based
on
the
immediate
custodian
rule
and
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
courts,
was
that
habeas
in
guantanamo
is
a
novelty.
it's...
1973
at
best.
if
i
could
finish
with
just
bringing
the
court's
attention
to
one
thing.
this
is
in
an
amicus
brief
that
is
in
support
of
us,
the
criminal
justice
legal
foundation
brief.
but
there's
sufficiently
little
precedence
for
the
court
to
rely
on,
and
i
want
the
court
to
have
this:
the
schiever
case,
which
is
one
of
the
prisoner-of-war
cases.
there's
not...
in
the
rasul
case,
justice
stevens,
and
the
parties,
we
both
cited
to
volume
97
of
english
reporter
and
the
report
of
the
case
by
burrow...
there
is
in
the
english
reports
an
alternative
report
of
that
case,
from
kenyon.
and
the
report
of
that
case
which
is
96
english
reports
1249
is
actually
longer
on
the
law,
shorter
on
the
facts,
but
longer
on
the
law
than
the
report
by
lord
burrow.
so
i
wanted
the
court
to
have
that
available
to
them.
