suppose
there
had
not
been
a
six-year
wait,
would
it
be
appropriate
then
for
us
to...
if
you
prevail...
remand
the
case
to
the
habeas
court
and
instruct
the
habeas
court
to
defer
until
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
finished
the
dta
review
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
should
i
assume
that
the
district
court
in
washington
would
be
any
faster
than
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
that
take
place
in
the
csrt
review
proceedings
that
are
pending?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
heartened
by
the
prospect
that
the
detainees
could
apply
to
the
cuban
courts,
which
would
then
hand
process
to
the
commanding
general
at
guantanamo?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
understand
that
point
when
you
were
having
your
colloquy
with
justice
breyer,
either.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
answer
to
justice
breyer,
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
have
the
right
to
determine
whether
to
the
extent
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
applicable,
whether
such
standards
and
procedures,
such
as
csrt,
are...
to
make
the
determination...
are
consistent
with
the
constitution--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
provided
in
the
mca.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
statute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
statute
talks
about
standards.
why
can't
that
question
that
justice
breyer
raised
be
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
csrt
review
hearings
when
it
determines
the
constitutional
adequacy
of
the
standards,
or
am
i
missing
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
one
more
question
on
that
point:
would
the
court
of
appeals
in...
under
the
mca
have
the
authority
to
question
the
constitutionality
of
the
definition
of
noncombatant...
of
unlawful
combatant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
can
we
fit
your
position
when
we
have
no
jurisdiction
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
our
opinion
says
have
a
nice
day,
everybody.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
does
that
tell
you
about
the
adequacy
of
the
substitute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
the
first
case
is
06-1195,
boumediene
versus
bush.
in
these
cases
the
petitioners
are
aliens
detained
at
the
united
states
naval
station
at
guantanamo
bay,
cuba.
military
tribunals
held
individual
hearings
and
classified
these
petitioners
as
enemy
combatants.
those
tribunals
are
known
as
combatant
status
review
tribunals
or
csrts.
these
cases
began
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
there
the
petitioners
sought,
and
they
now
ask
us
to
allow
them
to
continue
to
seek,
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
test
the
legality
of
their
detention.
they
made
this
argument
as
well
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
columbia
circuit.
that
court
held
there
is
no
statutory
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
habeas
corpus
to
these
petitioners,
that
the
constitutional
privilege
of
habeas
corpus
was
not
available
to
them
and
that
the
applicable
review
procedures
were
those
provided
by
congress
when
it
was
assigned
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
authority
to
review
determinations
made
by
the
csrts.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
claim
that
the
petitioners
are
entitled
habeas
corpus.
this
court
decided
the
case
rasul
versus
bush
four
terms
ago.
the
court's
opinion
held
that
under
the
then
controlling
statute,
the
power
of
federal
courts
to
issue
habeas
corpus
did
reach
guantanamo.
that
was
a
statutory
mandate.
congress
then
twice
amended
the
statute
to
eliminate
the
right
of
the
detainees
at
guantanamo
to
seek
the
writ.
the
threshold
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
petitioners'
argument
that
the
latest
amendment
limiting
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
does
not
apply
to
them,
because
their
suits
were
pending
on
the
date
of
the
enactment.
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
amendments
do
withdraw
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
writ
in
pending
cases
and
we
agreed.
our
opinion
today
next
discusses
two
other
arguments
made
by
the
petitioners.
first,
despite
the
law
attempting
to
repeal
authority
to
issue
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
are
they
entitled
to
the
writ,
because
under
the
constitution,
this
right
or
privilege
extends
to
guantanamo
and
to
them.
second,
if
petitioners
have
this
right,
are
the
statutory
review
procedures
in
the
court
of
appeals
an
adequate
substitute
for
habeas
corpus.
in
addressing
whether
the
opinion
--
that
the
petitioners
have
the
habeas
corpus
privilege
under
the
constitution,
the
opinion
examines
whether
and
in
what
circumstances
the
power
to
issue
the
writ
can
extend
to
aliens
who
are
beyond
the
nation's
borders
and
this
discussion
is
somewhat
lengthy.
we
examined
the
history
of
habeas
corpus
in
england
as
it
must
have
informed
the
intended
purposes
of
the
framers
of
our
own
constitution,
and
we
note
cases
and
authorities,
discussing
whether
english
courts
could
issue
habeas
corpus
for
persons
held
in
india,
scotland,
ireland,
exempt
jurisdictions
like
the
channel
islands,
and
after
1789,
canada.
that
history
is
not
conclusive.
we
point
out,
however,
that
this
history
most
surely
does
not
teach
that
a
court's
power
or
a
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
writ
would
be
barred
in
this
instance.
we
then
looked
the
precedents
concerning
the
reach
of
some
constitutional
protections
to
territories
outside
the
nation's
borders.
this
requires
us
to
consider
other
cases
like
johnson
versus
eisentrager.
there
the
court
considered
whether
there
was
authority
to
issue
the
writ
when
it
was
sought
by
prisoners
of
war
held
in
germany
after
world
war
ii.
we
conclude
that
cases
like
eisentrager
instruct
that
formalistic
concepts
like
sovereignty
do
not
control
the
matter
at
hand,
rather
objective
factors
and
practical
concerns
are
of
primary
relevance.
with
regard
to
the
habeas
corpus
provision,
the
suspension
clause,
we
conclude
that
at
least
three
factors
are
relevant
in
determining
the
writ's
extraterritorial
reach.
first,
the
citizenship
and
status
of
the
detainees
seeking
the
writ
and
the
adequacy
of
the
process
through
which
that
status
determination
was
made.
second,
the
nature
of
the
sites
where
apprehension
and
then
detention
took
place
and
three,
the
practical
obstacles
that
might
be
inherent
in
resolving
the
prisoners'
entitlement
to
the
writ.
applying
the
whole
analysis,
we
conclude
that
the
writ
does
run
to
the
naval
station
and
to
these
detainees.
these
detainees,
therefore,
have
a
constitutional
privilege
to
seek
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
as
we
hold
that
the
habeas
corpus
privilege
runs
to
guantanamo
and
to
these
petitioners,
it
follows
that
congress
must
not
contravene
the
suspension
clause
as
it
applies
to
persons
detained
at
the
naval
station
because
congress
did
not
purport
to
enact
a
formal
suspension
of
the
writ,
pursuant
to
the
clause
as
exception
and
the
exception
is
for
cases
of
rebellion
or
invasion,
the
question
arises
whether
the
procedure
provided
to
review
the
csrt
determinations
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
an
adequate
substitute
for
habeas
corpus.
in
its
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
writ
did
not
run
to
the
detainees,
so
it
was
unnecessary
for
that
court
to
consider
the
adequacy
of
the
csrt
review
procedures
and
whether
that
was
an
adequate
substitute
for
the
writ.
in
the
ordinary
course,
we
likely
would
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
in
the
first
instance
whether
the
review
procedures
are
an
adequate
substitute
for
habeas
corpus.
here,
however,
there
are
exceptional
circumstances.
these
include
the
gravity
of
the
constitutional
issues,
the
length
of
the
detention
to
date
and
the
indeterminate
time
during
which
detention
might
continue.
some
of
these
detainees
have
been
in
custody
for
six
years.
so
we
now
reach
the
question
whether
the
review
procedure
congress
provided
is
an
adequate
substitute.
we
find
this
statutory
review
procedure
is
not
an
adequate
substitute.
the
opinion
discusses
past
instances
of
congressional
statutes
that
provided
for
alternative
and
supplemental
review
procedures.
we
note
that
in
those
instances
the
habeas
corpus
right
was
still
preserved,
that
is
not
true
here.
here
the
applicable
statute
eliminates
habeas
corpus
altogether.
we
consider
also
the
restrictions
on
the
procedure
congress
has
provided,
namely
the
limits
on
introducing
evidence
discovered
after
the
csrt
proceeding
concluded.
since
there
is
no
adequate
substitute,
these
habeas
corpus
actions
must
proceed.
now
the
statute,
we
identify
as
unconstitutional,
is
the
jurisdiction
stripping
provision
of
the
military
commissions
act
of
2006.
the
review
process
for
csrt
hearings
and
the
csrts
themselves
can
remain
intact,
but
the
habeas
corpus
process
in
these
cases
where
there
has
been
a
delay,
can
proceed
at
once.
our
security
depends
upon
a
sophisticated
intelligence
apparatus
and
the
ability
of
the
armed
forces
to
act
and
to
interdict.
there
are
further
considerations
however.
security
subsists
to
infidelity
to
freedom's
first
principles.
chief
among
these
are
freedom
from
arbitrary
and
unlawful
restraint,
and
the
personal
liberty
that
is
secured
by
adherence
to
the
separation
of
powers.
it
is
from
these
principles
that
the
judicial
authority
to
consider
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
relief
derives.
our
opinion
does
not
undermine
the
executive's
powers
as
commander-in-chief.
the
exercise
of
those
powers
is
vindicated,
not
eroded,
when
confirmed
by
the
judicial
branch.
within
the
constitution's
separation
of
power
structure,
few
exercises
of
judicial
power
are
as
legitimate
or
as
necessary
as
the
responsibility
to
hear
challenges
to
the
authority
of
the
executive
to
imprison
a
person.
as
noticed,
some
of
these
petitioners
have
been
in
custody
for
six
years
with
no
definitive
judicial
determination
as
to
the
legality
of
their
detention.
their
access
to
the
writ
is
a
necessity
to
determine
the
lawfulness
of
their
status
even
if
in
the
end
they
do
not
obtain
the
relief
they
seek.
and
it
bears
repeating
that
our
opinion
does
not
address
the
content
of
the
war
that
governs
petitioners'
detention.
that
is
a
matter
yet
to
be
determined.
we
do
hold
that
the
petitioners
may
invoke
the
fundamental
procedural
protections
of
habeas
corpus.
the
laws
in
constitution
are
designed
to
survive
and
remain
in
force
in
extraordinary
times.
liberty
and
security
can
be
reconciled
and
in
our
system
they
are
reconciled
within
the
framework
of
the
law.
the
framers
decided
that
habeas
corpus,
a
right
of
first
importance,
must
be
part
of
that
framework,
part
of
that
law.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
with
instructions
that
it
remand
these
cases
to
the
district
court
for
additional
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justices
scalia,
thomas
and
alito
have
joined.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
the
chief
justice,

thomas
