the
converse
question
is:
could
we
prosecute
a
crime
committed
in
guantanamo
by
cubans?
and
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clement,
you
said
it
was
modeled
after
190-8.
is
it
identical
to
190-8?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
that
personal
representative
chosen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
190-8,
does
the
defendant
have
a
right
to
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
these
people
are
not
in
uniform,
so
they're
not
an
under
the
law
of
war.
they
have
all
committed
murder,
not
just
fighting
a
war.
that's
your
theory,
i
think.
they
are
all
committed
war
crimes.
those
that
were
caught
on
the
battlefield,
i
mean.
i'm
talking
about
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
and
they
are
not
prisoners
of
war
under
the
law
of
war,
because
they
were
not
in
uniform.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
common
law.
i
mean
under
the
law
of
war,
the
common
law
of
war.
they
were
not
prisoners
of
war.
justice
john
paul
stevens
their
engaging
in
war-like
acts
would
be
the
crime
of
murder
or
the
crime
of
assault
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
that's
how
i
understand
your
theory
in
one
of
these
prosecutions
is
that
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
mean
it
is
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
the
duration
of
hostilities,
if
you
can
show
that
they
are
enemies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clement,
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
breyer...
and
maybe
i'm
missing
something...
would
be
that
there
is
a
third
alternative
which
he
didn't
consider,
namely:
that
these
are
combatants
picked
up
on
the
battlefield,
and
they
may
be
detained
indefinitely
without
proving
they
committed
a
crime.
and
that
is
your
position,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
a
hypothetical
claim
that
a
particular
prisoner
says:
i
was
kidnapped
by
people
who
were
not
in
the
united
states
army
and
sold
for
a
bounty.
and
i
am...
i
just
happened
to
be
there
when
i
got
kidnapped.
and
then
there
is
a
genuine
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
fact
that
they
may
have
been
sold
in
that
manner
justifies
detention,
which
is
a
different
question
entirely
from
whether
they
committed
a
violation
under
the
law
of
war.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
again,
and
i
know
your
argument.
but
with
respect
to
those
claims,
do
you
make
the
argument
in
your
brief
that
some
evidence
is
enough
to
refute
that
claim,
or
do
you
say
it
is
a
preponderance
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
main
issue
the
fact
that
it
has
taken
six
years
to
have
the
issue
resolved...
"relevant"--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
say
they
have
been
unlawfully
detained
for
six
years
from
the
beginning.
and
isn't
that
delay
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
they
have
been
provided
such
a
wonderful
set
of
procedures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clement--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--general
clement,
your
suggested
reason
why
they're
right
is
quite
different
from
the
reason
they
actually
gave.
they
did
not
reach
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
these
procedures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
did
not
reach
this
very
important
part
of
the
whole
case.
and,
of
course,
the
substitute
procedures
here
are
not
nearly
the
same
as
those
in
our
prior
cases
of
where
we
sustained
the
2255
and
district
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
those
later
cases
are
not
relevant
because
habeas
corpus
in
the
modern
world
is
much
broader
than
it
was
in
1789.
that's
part
of
your
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
comparison
you
ask
us
to
make
is
between
what
the
habeas
writ
was
in
1789,
not
what
the
comparison
to
a
habeas
writ
would
be
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
you
would
seriously
contend
that
the
procedures
set
forth
in
the
statute
are
equivalent
to
those
afforded
under
the
habeas
writ
under
today's
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
you
haven't
argued
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
point
i
made,
i
think
that's
critical
to
your
argument
that
the
substitute
is
adequate.
