mr.
stern,
at
the
time
that
the
motor
carrier
deregulation
came
into
effect,
were
there
any
products
where
maine
told
the
retailer,
if
you
want
to
sell
not
face-to-face,
you
must
choose
a
carrier
that
will
provide
x,
y,
and
z
services?
was
there
any...
is
tobacco
alone
or
were
there
other
commodities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
postal
service
adhere
to...
or
i
don't
know
if
the
postal
service
is
used
to
ship
cigarettes,
tobacco
products.
but
if
it
is,
does
the
postal
service
adhere
to
maine's
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
does...
you
say
the
postal
service
provides
something
that
conforms,
that
they
have
the...
you
must
deliver
it
to
the
person,
to
the
addressee
herself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
wasn't
clear
from
their
brief.
i
thought
they
had
a
footnote
that
said
they
weren't
arguing
the
point
in
this
case,
but
i
thought
they
didn't
concede
the
total
ban.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
the
result
of
a
settlement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
nationwide,
not
just
in
new
york;
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
then,
practically,
you
don't
have
a
problem
with
cigarettes
because
the
new
york
settlement
takes
care
of
it.
you're
just
talking
about
other
tobacco
products?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought,
as
a
result
of
the
new
york
settlement,
carriers
are
no
longer
shipping
directly
to
consumers
anyplace
cigarettes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stern,
you
told
me
in...
in
response
to
my
question
earlier,
you
mentioned
only,
i
think,
game;
and
you
said
that
those
prohibitions
were
directly
on
the
carrier--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
is,
prohibitions
and
instructions
for
how
you
can
ship
game.
and
i
don't
know
if
that...
if
there
are
other
food
products.
you
mentioned
only
that
one.
and
is
it
not
the
case
that
explosives...
that
that's
federal
regulation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
there...
in
addition
to
the
federal
regulation,
which
i
take
it
would
cover
various
dangerous
substances,
does
maine
add
to
what
the
federal
regulation
is,
say,
for
sending
fireworks,
firearms?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
do
that,
ms.
brinkmann,
would
you
tell
us
how
alcohol
is
handled,
because
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that's
by
virtue
of
the
24th
amendment
state
regulation.
does
ups
carry
alcohol
packages
from
one
state
to
another?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
asked
the
question
only
in
response
to
your
impossibility
argument
that
you
couldn't
cope
with
such
state
regulations
with
respect
to
tobacco,
when
it
seems
you
are
with
respect
to
alcohol.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
they
deal
with
under
the
new
york
settlement?
i
take
it
this
would
be
a
problem
under
that
settlement,
because
it
doesn't
touch
selling
from
a
duly
licensed
dealer.
and
so,
under
the
new
york
settlement,
which
operates
nationwide,
what
does
the
carrier
do
to
make
sure
that
the
recipient
is
a
licensed
dealer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
first
condition,
and
the
package
is
clearly
labeled,
aren't
there
some
commodities
where
ups
does
have
to
pay
attention
to
the
label?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
can't
be...
ms.
brinkmann
told
us
that
they've
got
these...
so
many
packages
and
it's
going
to
cost
millions.
but
they
do
have
to
do
it
for
a
package
that's
labeled
hazardous.
