mr.
paul
stern
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
left
to
the
states
and
encouraged
them
to
deal
with
the
significant
public
health
problem
of
youth
access
to
tobacco.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
faaa
act
nonetheless
preempts
the
two
state
laws
before
the
court
and
those
laws
that
ensure
that
tobacco
shipped
into
the
state
of
maine
does
not
end
up
in
the
hands
of
our
children.
it
is
not
contested
that
maine
can
and,
in
fact,
has
banned
the
retail
sale
of
tobacco
unless
the
seller
verifies
the
age
of
the
buyer.
section
1555-c(3)(c)
regulates
the
seller
and
not
a
carrier.
it
requires
that
a...
in
the
context
of
a
delivery
sale,
a
seller
cannot
engage
in
that
sale
in
the
state
of
maine
unless
the
seller
ensures
that
the
person
delivering
the
tobacco
actually
verifies
the
age
of
the
buyer.
this
law
does
not
relate
to
the
services
of
the
carrier,
but
rather
relates
to
a
dangerous
substance
that
congress
has
asked
the
states
and
left
to
the
states
and
encouraged
the
states
to
deal
with.
mr.
paul
stern
exactly--
mr.
paul
stern
--well,
your
honor,
section
1555-c
(3)(c)
does
not
dictate
at
all
what
a
carrier
has
to
do.
it
is
an
incentive
that
permits
a
carrier,
if
the
carrier
wishes
to
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
for
the
legal
tobacco
delivery
market--
mr.
paul
stern
--they
can
get
out
of
the
business
or
compete
for
the
business,
your
honor.
but
the
point
is
that
the
law
regulates
the
retailer
and
not
the
carrier
and,
in
doing
so,
similar
to
the
situation
in
travelers,
allows
for
a
market
to
be
created.
in
particular,
however,
with
respect
to
this
particular
situation,
congress
has
spoken
directly
to
it
and
this
court
has
considered
in
the
context
of
its
erisa
cases
how
congress
has
dealt
specifically
with
the
problem
before
the
court.
mr.
paul
stern
we
don't
agree
that
it
adopted
such
a
broad
view
because
in
morales
the
court
was
very
careful
in
the
opinion
to
make
clear
that
it
was
not
drawing
a
line
which
would
bring
potentially
such
laws
dealing
with
gambling
or
prostitution
within
the
preemptive
ambit
of
the
ada.
similarly,
in...
with
respect
to
the
faa
act,
particularly
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
in
any
way
to
deal
with
the
state's
controlling
and
regulating
dangerous
substances
such
as
tobacco.
mr.
paul
stern
your
honor,
looking
at
the
objectives
of
congress
as
explained
by
congress
in
the
legislative
record,
it's
very
clear
that
congress
was
concerned,
the
committee
was
concerned
with,
the
proponents
such
as
the
federal
department
of
transportation,
were
concerned
with
the
effects
of
the
particular
category
of
regulation,
state
economic
regulation.
the
committee
mentioned
that
nine
times.
the
united
states--
mr.
paul
stern
--well,
your
honor,
we
suggest
that
the
court
looks
at
the
faa
act
and
its
legislative
history,
as
well
as
what
immediately
preceded
it,
which
was
the
synar
amendment.
the
synar
amendment
encouraged
the
states
to
deal
with
this
problem.
the
federal
government--
mr.
paul
stern
--it
states
quite
clearly
that
the
intent
is
to
encourage
the
states
to
prohibit...
or
to
enforce/enact
laws
that
prohibit
retailers
and
distributors
from
getting
tobacco
to
children.
mr.
paul
stern
well,
a
sale
consists
of
several
components,
your
honor:
order,
payment,
and
delivery.
handing
it
over,
handing
the
tobacco
over
physically
to
the
buyer,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
buyer's
standpoint
and
from
the
standpoint
of
public
health
perspective,
is
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
transaction.
it
is
the
seller
who
has
the
responsibility
to
comply
with
the
law
with
respect
to
each
one
of
those
steps.
mr.
paul
stern
interestingly,
there...
maine
being
a
hunting
state,
there
was
a
law
on
the
books
which
required
the
common
carrier...
it
specifically
referred
to
the
common
carrier...
to
verify
that
the
person
shipping
it
was
the
hunter
with
the
appropriate
license,
required
the
common
carrier
to
affix
identification
tags
to
the
hunting...
the
hunting
reward,
so
to
speak,
and
also
to
make
a
return
or
provide
notice
to
the
commissioner
of
inland
fisheries
and
wildlife.
so
maine
had
a
variety
of
those
sorts
of
laws
on
the
books
that
required
carriers
to
actually
do
something
with
respect
to
a
particular
type
of
commodity.
mr.
paul
stern
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
the
postal
service
has
immunity
from
maine
laws.
and
second,
the
postal
service,
interestingly,
does
have
an
addressee
verification
service
for
$4.10.
mr.
paul
stern
i
believe
there--
mr.
paul
stern
--i
hope
not,
your
honor.
but
with
respect
to
a
variety
of
civil
regulatory
matters,
i
believe
the
courts
have
concluded
that
the
united
states
postal
service
has
immunity
from
maine...
from
maine
and
other
state
laws.
mr.
paul
stern
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
not
exactly
conforming
because...
it's
sort
of
interesting.
different
carrier
services
or
the
postal
service
have
different
sort
of
options
that
seem
to
make
clear
that
this
is
not
a
real
problem
to
provide.
the
u.s.
postal
service
provides
an
addressee
verification
service,
but
not
an
age
verification
service.
ups
provides
an
age
verification
service,
but
not
an
addressee
verification
service.
since
one
costs
$2.75
and
the
other
one
costs
$4.10,
this
does
not
seem
to
be
an
acute
problem
to...
for
a
carrier,
if
it
wishes
to
compete
for
the
market,
to
actually
compete
for
it
and
price
it
appropriately.
mr.
paul
stern
there
have
been
efforts
to
deal
with
the
postal
service
loophole,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
paul
stern
--i
think
i
heard
somebody
mention
that,
your
honor.
[laughter]
certainly,
in
another
branch
of
government,
that...
there's
an
effort
to
deal
with
that
problem.
but,
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
we've
driven
fedex
out
of
business,
there's
no
suggestion...
well,
first
of
all,
we
have
no
evidence
with
respect
to
what
this
effect
has
had
on
fedex.
with
respect
to
ups,
ups
continues
to
ship
tobacco
to
licensees
and
has
not
shown
in
the
record
that
they
lost
any
business
with
any
of
their
customers,
obtained
licenses
from
the
state
of
maine,
and
therefore
it
could
actually
ship
into
the
state
of
maine.
mr.
paul
stern
well,
your
honor,
the
respondent's
arguments
do
not
guarantee
uniform
regulation.
in
fact,
they
guarantee
exactly
the
opposite.
they
don't
dispute
that
maine
and
other
states
can
ban
the
transport
and
delivery
of
what
we
can
call
unlicensed
tobacco,
tobacco
from
unlicensed
retailers,
to
unlicensed
entities.
different
states
can
have
different
licensing
requirements
and
certainly
different
licensees.
so
a
patchwork
is
created.
in
addition,
respondents
agree
that
states
can
outright
ban
the
furnishing
of
a
variety
of
commodities
or
contraband,
including
in
particular
tobacco
or
alcohol--
mr.
paul
stern
--i
believe
if
one
looks
at...
it's
either
page
24
or
44
of
the
brief...
they
concede
that
maine
and
other
states
can
ban
the
furnishing
of
tobacco.
mr.
paul
stern
i
believe
they
do,
your
honor.
i
believe...
i
think
it's
at
page
44...
they
concede
that
maine
can
ban
the
furnishing
of
tobacco
by
anyone,
including
a
carrier.
mr.
paul
stern
well,
there
is
a
knowledge
requirement
in
the
first
part
of
section
1555-d.
and
your
honor's
question
gets
right
to
the
nub
of
the
problem
with
respect
to
the
lower
court's
decision
on
1555-d,
which
is:
how
does
maine
or
any
other
state
go
about
proving
knowing
delivery
of
an
unlicensed
product
such
as
this?
mr.
paul
stern
without
the
evidentiary
assumption,
it's
very
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
prove,
which
essentially
makes
the
first
part
of
the
court's
decision
with
respect
to
1555--
mr.
paul
stern
--a
commerce
clause
problem?
mr.
paul
stern
it
depends
upon
how
the
statute
is
written.
if
it
banned--
mr.
paul
stern
--well--
mr.
paul
stern
--the
new
york
law
banned
the
delivery
and
sale
of
tobacco...
delivery
and
sales
of
cigarettes
to
b(2)--
mr.
paul
stern
--the...
the
law
was...
existed
before
the
settlement,
and
the
settlement
which
we
have
referred
to
is
a
situation
where
ups
and
a
number
of
other
carriers
have
agreed
to
conform
with
it,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
stern
yes,
your
honor.
and
it...
it
reveals,
we
think,
that
the...
that
the
nature
of
the
laws
here
are
not
so
burdensome
as
to
run
afoul
of
this
court's
concerns--
mr.
paul
stern
--well,
there
are
other
tobacco
products,
but
in
the
new
york
settlement...
we
can't
enforce
the
new
york
settlement,
your
honor.
we
have
our
own
separate
law,
particularly
section--
mr.
paul
stern
--that
is
the
intent
of
that,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
how
effective
it
has
been.
but
by
doing
that,
they
have
agreed
and
put
in
place
a
system
where
tobacco
products
can
only
be
shipped
from
a
licensee.
mr.
paul
stern
that
would
seem
to
clearly
run
afoul
of
the--
mr.
paul
stern
--commerce
clause.
mr.
paul
stern
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
stern
--they
necessarily
could,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
stern
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
the
difference
between
the
hypothetical
you
proposed
at
the
beginning
of
your
question
and
what's
going
on
in
maine
with
respect
to
1555-c(3)(c),
which
is
a
mouthful.
at
the
time
the
faaa
act
was
enacted,
it
was
illegal
for
anyone
to...
an
unlicensed
retailer,
to
sell
tobacco
in
the
state
of
maine,
and
it
was
illegal
to
sell
tobacco
without
verifying
the
age
of
the
buyer.
that's
the
generally
applicable
law
that
was...
a
judicial
sort
of
law
that
was
on
the
books
in
1994.
the
skull
and
crossbones
requirement
is
not
a
judicial
type
of
law,
and
what
this
court
has
done
in
the
erisa
cases
is
look
to
see
the...
the
purpose
and
type
of
law
that
is
before
it
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
type
of
law
that
was
in
existence
and
whether
there
was
any
positive
indication
that...
that
that
sort
of
law
was
supposed
to
be
pre-empted
or
not.
here
these
sorts
of
age
verification
laws
were
on
the
books.
we
have
identified
the
problem
and
everybody
understands
the
problem
with
respect
to
delivery
and
sales.
it
would
be
absurd
for
an
over-the-counter
clerk
to
take
money
from
someone--
mr.
paul
stern
--there
are
no...
i'm
not
aware
of
any
that
we...
we
regulate
in
the
same
way.
in
similar--
mr.
paul
stern
--there
are
not
exactly
the
same
restrictions.
but,
with
respect
to
alcohol,
we
have
a
law
on
the
books
which
prohibits
the
knowing
sale
or
transfer
of
alcohol
to
somebody
who
is
underage.
because
of
the...
the
unique
situation
we
found
with
respect
to
delivery
and
sales
of
tobacco,
we've
put
this
in
place
to
make
it
clear
how
a
seller
goes
about
conforming
with
maine's
generally
applicable
law.
mr.
paul
stern
well,
your
honor,
we
do
try
to
regulate
those.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
paul
stern
there
is
no
law
exactly
like
this
one
with
respect
to
the
other
types
of...
of
dangerous
substances.
there
is--
mr.
paul
stern
--that's
correct.
mr.
paul
stern
the
federal
government
has
a
role
with
respect
to
the
shipment
of
explosives,
but
it
has
no
role
with
respect
to
the
shipment
of
tobacco.
mr.
paul
stern
with
respect
to
fireworks,
maine
in
its
discretion
has
adopted
the
federal
role...
the
federal
view,
which,
i
think,
emphasizes
and...
and
highlights
the
different
situation
we
have
here.
when
the
federal
government
believed
there
should
be
some
sort
of
uniform
regulation
of
a
particular
dangerous
item,
be
it
fireworks,
for
example,
or
hazardous
material,
it
does
so.
otherwise,
it
leaves
it
to
the
states.
and
this
is
a
situation
where
if
the
state
doesn't
act
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
delivery
and
sales,
we
have
a
regulatory
void
and
nobody
deals
with
this
problem.
mr.
paul
stern
in
their
policies,
they
have
indicated
that
they
do
not
carry
game,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
stern
well--
mr.
paul
stern
--no.
your
honor,
ups
has
a
variety
of
options
such
as
a
cash-on-delivery
option
which
requires
them
to
run
around
and
find
somebody
with
a
check,
money
order,
or
credit
card.
so
they
can
price
these.
it's
just
a
matter
of
whether
they
want
to
compete
for
them.
and,
again,
with
respect
to
c(3)(c),
which
i'd
like
to
focus
on
for
a
moment,
it
would
be
absurd,
we
think,
to
have
a
situation
where
a
clerk
in
an
over-the-counter
sale
could
accept
money
from
a
buyer,
verify
the
age
of
the
buyer,
and
then
turn
to
a
third
person
and
hand
the
tobacco
to
that
person
without
the
buyer
being
present.
that
is
exactly
the
situation
that
respondents
ask
this
court
to
embrace
as
the
intent
of
congress.
and
with
respect
to
your
honor's--
mr.
paul
stern
--well,
there
is
no
conflict
with
federal
law
under
our
reading
of
the
faaa
act
and
the
synar
amendment
because
the...
the
intent
of
congress
has
to
be
one
which
does
not
end
up
in
an
absurd
result.
and
we
suggest
that
having
this
gaping
conduit
of
tobacco
to
children
is
just
such
an
absurd
result.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
paul
stern
thank
you,
your
honor.
beginning
with
the
last
series
of
questions,
if
the
court
looks
at
pages
100
to
102
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
court
will
see
that
ups
has
a
computer
dial-up
system
which
allows
it
to
keep
track
of,
and
provide
alerts
for,
shippers'
addresses
and
consignees,
as
well
as
they
can
keep
track
of
what
is
called
an
sic
code
which
is
with
respect
to
commodities.
and
they
can
keep
track
of
tobacco
commodities.
there
seems
to
be
a
misconception
here,
and
i
apologize
for
that.
maine's
law
is
not
a
criminal
law.
it
provides
for
civil
violations
between
$50
and,
i
think,
$1500.
regarding
quantification,
the
only
hard
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
it
costs
ups
less
than
one
cents
a...
one
cent
a
package
to
look
at
the
label
to
determine
whether
a...
a
particular
name
is
problematic
or
not.
mr.
paul
stern
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
stern
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
because,
as
ms.
brinkmann
explained,
the...
the
looking
at
the
label
is
done
usually
in
ups's
situation
by
a
preloader.
and
the
preloader
is
in
the
particular
state.
so
it
still
would
be
less
than
one
cent
a
state
for
each
state
it
happened
to
be
in.
the
$2
a
package
is
for
the
actual
intercepted
packages.
in
a
five-month
period,
there
were
a
total
of
33
intercepted
packages,
and
the
citation
to
the
record
is
at
page
106.
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
is
there
any
proof
in
this
record
that
it
costs
$32
million
a
year
to
comply
with
maine's
law.
mr.
paul
stern
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
butler,
who
provided
a
document
on
this,
it
is
looking
at
the
label
and
determining
whether
it
appears
to
be
from
a
tobacco
retailer.
mr.
paul
stern
yes.
your
honor's
question
raises
two
points.
first,
with
respect
to
the
names,
if
one
goes
and
looks
at
the
list
of
unlicensed
tobacco
retailers,
virtually
all
of
them
have
something
