ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
maine's
tobacco
delivery
law
is
not
preempted,
congress's
core
purpose
for
the
faaaa
will
be
defeated.
there
will
be
different
delivery
laws
in
states
across
the
country,
and
that
patchwork
will
eliminate
the
efficiency
and
the
cost
savings
that
was
congress's
intent
in
the
faaaa
when
it
enacted
it
to
deregulate
the
industry.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
try
and
quantify
for
you
the
enormous
impact
and
effect
that
these
two
provisions
have
on
carrier
services.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
alcohol
is,
of
course,
governed
by
a
different
legal
regime
because
of
the
21st
amendment.
and
yes,
they
do
provide
services
for
wine
and
beer
only,
and
that
service
has
to
be
pursuant
to
a
contract.
it
is
a
special
contract
with
the
shipper,
and
the
shipper
has
to
be
licensed.
and
ups
and
the
other
carriers
have
uniform
procedures
for
doing
that,
so
they
are
not
subject
to
a
patchwork
of
regulation,
unless
there
are
laws
in
the
states
that
are
allowed
because
of
the
21st
amendment.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
give
the
quantification,
i
think,
about
the
impact
of
these
provisions.
i
would
first
point
out
that
the
services
that
are
provided
right
now
are
in
response
to
the
market
and
market
competition,
which
was
congress's
intent.
and
these,
of
course,
would
be
services
that
were
created
in
response
to
a
state
dictate,
which
is
at
the
core
of
the
problem.
but
just
to
give
you
an
idea
about
the
c(3)(c),
which
is
the
delivery
confirmation--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
it
involves
much
more
complicated
constitutional
issues
that
reach
the
21st
amendment.
i
think
even
in
light
of
this
court's
opinion
in
granholm
v.
heald,
there
would
be
more
complex
issues
to
analyze--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
it
may
be
not
be,
your
honor.
the
problem
has
been
taken
care
of
by
this
uniform
service,
and
i
have
to
say
that
is
at
the
age
of
21.
that
is
an
adult
confirmation.
and
that
is
not
an
addressee-specific
requirement.
here
under
c(3)(c),
it
would
be
a
new
service
that
required
the
actual
addressee
to
sign
for
it.
and
i
should
comment,
my
understanding
of
u.s.
postal
service
is
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
addressee
who
signs.
they
can
designate
someone
else
to
sign
for
it,
and
there
is
no
age
verification.
but
here
it
has
to
be
the
addressee,
and
there
has
to
be
photo
government
id
for
anyone
between
18
and
27.
and
if
i
could
just
for--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--if
the
state
was
dictating
a
service
that
made--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
would
depend
on
the
effect
on
the
carriers.
and
if
i
could--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--driven
by
market
competition,
your
honor.
the
evidence--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
in
this
case
the
evidence
demonstrates...
in
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
there's
the
deposition
by
ms.
meisel,
which
explains
on
pages
163
and
189
that
it's
not
flipping
a
switch
to
create
a
new
service
like
this.
many
systems
would
have
to
be
completely
reengineered
to
take
in
new
data
about
age
and
addressee.
there
would
have
to
be
a
new
system
for
the
alert.
there
would
have
to
be
a
new
system
for
reading
the
alert.
that
takes
one
and-a-half
years,
18
months,
for
that
modification
to
occur.
that's
an
enormous
effect.
and
i
would
also
like
just
to
look
at--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--on
the
carrier
services.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
if
there
were
a
requirement
or
maine
law,
for
example,
for
a
widely
already
established
adult
signature
requirement,
that
may
have
a
different
preemption
analysis.
there
certainly
would
not
be
the
problems
of
uniformity.
but
i
don't
think
it
could
be
something
that's
dictated.
and
if
a--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that
cost
that
i
just
described
has
to
be
multiplied
for
50
states
and
many
commodities.
and
also,
if
you
look
at
the
1555-d,
the
prohibition
on
unlicensed
tobacco
retailers
sending
to
a
consume
and
the
imputed
knowledge,
the
law
that
has
strict
liability
on
the
carrier,
if
there
is
a
box
that
has
a
shipper's
name
from
the
attorney
general's
list,
that
imputed
knowledge
would
require
that
every
one
of
the
65,000
or
16
million
packages
going
to
maine
every
year
be
examined
for
the
shipper
identification.
and
in
the
record,
there
is...
the
state
has
admitted
at
j-96
that
that
kind
of
research
to
look
into...
in
this
case
it
was
looking
at
the
sender,
but
it
would
be
the
same
for
the
shipper...
i
mean,
it
was
looking
for
the
addressee;
this
would
be
for
the
shipper...
is
two
dollars
per
package.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
under
the
new
york
settlement
there's
a
very
complex
structure
that
the
carriers
have
agreed
to,
first
of
all
forbidding
all
delivery
of
cigarettes
to
consumers.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
is
a
citation
to
it
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it's
available,
i
believe,
on
the
attorney
general
of
new
york's
web
site.
there's
a
very...
for
example,
in
the
ups
assurance
of
discontinuance,
there's
a
three-tier
disciplinary
scheme
against
shippers
that
are
found
to
violate
that.
and
the
carriers
entered
into
these
agreements
under
threat
of
criminal
sanctions.
the
new
york
statute
made
one
offense
a
misdemeanor
and
a
second
offense
a
felony.
and
the
carriers,
who
had
been
trying
to
abide
by
those
laws,
were
faced
with
subpoenas
and
the
threat
of
prosecution.
and
so
their
solution
was
a
uniform
nationwide
policy,
no
cigarettes
to
consumers.
but
of
course--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--to
your
first
question,
just
to
complete
it,
your
honor,
at
ja-96
there's
an
admission
that
it's
a
two-dollar
cost
to
research
a
package.
there
it's
for
the
addressee,
but
it
would
be
the
same
for
the
shipper.
and
if
you
had
to
do
that
for
the
16
million
packages
going
to
maine
a
year
just
through
ups,
it
would
be
$32
million
a
year.
turning
to
your
knowledge
point,
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
point
that
the
court
was
discussing
earlier
and,
justice
scalia,
i
think
you
were
discussing
about
the
general
ban.
justice
ginsburg,
you
mentioned
our
footnote.
you
have
to
know
that
the
details
of
the
ban
are
to
figure
out
whether
or
not
it
is
pre-empted.
in
this
case,
the
first
circuit
at
pet.
app.
29
explains
why
its
construction
of
the
first
sentence
of
1555-d,
which
prohibits
any
person
from
knowingly
transporting
contraband
tobacco,
is
now
pre-empted.
but
it
makes
very
clear
that
the
state
law
is
pre-empted,
pet.
app.
29,
to
the
extent
that
maine's
tobacco
delivery
law
requires
or
has
the
effect
of
requiring
carriers
to
implement
state-mandated
procedures
in
the
processing
or
delivery
of
packages
as
pre-empted
by
the
faaaa.
so
to
the
extent
there
is
a
general
ban
against
knowing
transportation
that
does
not
require...
that
does
not
impose
a
strict
liability
requirement...
it's
a
strict
liability
that
says
it's
not
just
knowing,
you
have
to
look
at
every
shipper's
name.
you
have
to
look
at
every
side
of
that
box.
and
then
you
have
to
decide
who
the
recipient
is.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
if
i
gave
that
impression.
that
was
a--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
it
isn't.
this--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
it's
a
voluntary
agreement
in
which--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--in
which
the
carriers
adopted
a
uniform
approach.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
the
assurances
of
discontinuance...
specifically,
i
know
that
federal
express
and
ups
have
reserved
the
right
and
do
not
concede
that
the
new
york
law
is
not
preempted
under
faaaa.
there
is
no
concession
there,
your
honor.
i
want
to
make
that
abundantly
clear.
i
also
wanted
to
address
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think,
though,
if
i
could--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
if
you
understand
what
the
first
circuit
was
saying,
this
is
a
total
ban
on
knowing
delivery.
it
doesn't
require
the
carrier
to
change
their
services.
so
we...
the
carriers
don't
have
to
go
out
and
in
the
hundreds
of
countries
that
they
operate
change
the
intake
procedure
for
shipments
to
be
able
to
have
all
the
data
and
all
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--you
go
to
the
end
of
the
system,
is
where
the
knowledge
would
come
into
place.
in
reality,
under
the
current
operating
services
that
are
provided--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
wouldn't
necessarily
say
a
presumption,
your
honor.
it
is
evidence
that
can
be
used.
that...
we
recognize
that.
i
think
some
of
the
amici
suggest
that
we
say
it
cannot.
it
can
be
used.
it's
not
a
presumption.
it
is
not
something
that
deems
knowledge.
i
can
just
give
you
some
examples
of
practicality.
the
two
employees
who
actually
see
the
box,
loaders
and
sorters,
it's
going
by
so
fast,
they
don't...
aren't
reading
anything.
the
preloader
who
puts
it
into
the
truck--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--and
the
driver.
but
what
you
have
to
understand
is
sometimes
they're
packed
four
high.
some
deliveries
are
ten
to
one
business
and
each
side
of
each
box
is
not
viewed.
oftentimes
the
scan
on
the
bar
code
is
done
from
a
distance.
they
don't...
what
the
loaders
look
at
is
the
zip-code,
and
actually
with
increased
automation...
and
mr.
butler's
deposition,
which
was
filed
on...
back
in
june
of
2004,
he
talked
about
even
greater
automation
where
they
won't
even
be
reading
the
zip-code.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
not
my
understanding.
that's
not
the
evidence
in
this
case.
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
system
comes
in;
and
i
certainly
think
that
could
be
a
different
question
of
knowing
and
that
would
be
a
question
of
proof.
and
it
can
be
evidence.
but
i'll
tell
you,
if
there
was
a
driver
who
for
the
past
month
had
found
three
boxes
of
tobacco
and
turned
them
in
and
said,
you
know,
these
can't
be
delivered,
and
one
day
one
box
got
through
and
he
didn't
see
it
written,
or
it
was
written
in
light
marker
or
it
had,
you
know,
bled,
because
they
used
the
wrong
thing...
there's
no
uniformity
of
size
or
anything...
no,
i
think
that
would
be
a
question
for
a
jury
to
decide
about
knowledge,
and
it
can't
be
a
presumption
and
it
can't
be
deemed.
it
is
a
question
of
knowledge.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
that
would
be
for
congress,
and
it
would
have--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
specific
statute.
and
we
went
through
and
really
looked
at
the
statutes
that
the
state
cited,
and
you
can
see
in
our
brief
we
set
out,
a
third
of
them
have
knowledge
requirements.
another
group...
for
example
maine's
fireworks,
when
you
trace
it
down,
it
looks
like
a
local
commissioner
does
it,
and
then
they
adopt
these
standards
for
an
association.
and
what
is
it?
it's
a
federal
standard.
so
i
think
you
really
have
to
bore
into
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
the
way
in
which
the
first
circuit
construed
the
first
sentence
is
just
to
be
a
ban
on
knowing
transportation
delivery,
and
said
it
can't
require...
on
pages
26
and
27,
it
says
it
different
ways...
that
if
a
liability
standard
of
a
state
is
preempted,
if,
for
example,
it
required
modification
of
the
delivery
methods,
other
than
declining
the
package;
if
in
the
normal
course
of
the
services
that
are
already
provided,
if
there
is
knowledge
that
is
evidence--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--if
there
is
no
federal
regulatory...
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
are
many
federal
regulations
about
the
transportation--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
it
would
have
to
be
uniform,
and
i
think
that's
a
great
example.
the...
the
federal
scheme
for
hazardous
materials
are
extensive,
and
that
is
what
carriers
are
focused
on,
on
uniformity,
on
the
best
way
in
which
to
provide
these
services.
if
i
could,
i
just
wanted
to
discuss
for
a
moment
why
we
really
would
urge
that
there
is
no
health
and
safety
exception
or
that
this
can
be
read
to
be
limited
to
economics.
first
of
all--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
i
don't--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
did
not--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
do
not
cross-petition
on
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--what
we
are
responding
to
is
the
cert
petition
from
the
state
here.
i
would
point
out
that...
an
example
that
the
court
itself
gave
is
under
their
health
and
safety
exemption,
that
means
that
the
state
could
come
and
just
put
a
surcharge,
whether
it
would
be
on
tobacco
or
junk
food.
there
is
no
line
to
draw
between
the
position
they
take
here
and
that
kind
of
situation.
we
point
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
of
course,
and
the
findings
about
the
burdens
on
interstate
commerce
of
the
interstate
regulation.
the
structure...
there
is
a
facie
exemption
for
motor
vehicles
and
even
that
has
a
department
of
transportation
federal
backdrop
against
it.
and
in
the
morales
opinion
from
this
court,
they
pointed
to
the
airline
deregulation
act,
which
is
very
important
here
because
that
statute
is
construed
just
as
this
is.
and
in
the
morales
the
court
pointed
out
that
an
earlier
bill
had
had
the
kind
of
economic
regulation
that
the
state
here
seeks
and
it
was
rejected.
then
of
course
in
this
very
case,
the
congress...
conference
report
embraced
the
morales
standard
and
in
fact
described
it
as
a
broad
preemptive
standard
they
intended
apply
here.
so
we
believe
that
that
is
the
standard
that
should
really
apply,
but
in
light
of
the
effect
that
this
has
on
the
carrier
services,
we
suggest
it
means
any
standard
of
or
are
related
to.
there's
certainly
an
immediate
connection
with...
and
there
are
express
references
in
these
provisions
that
we
suggest
means
any
preemption
standard.
if
there's...
one
other
thing
i
would
say,
up
the
c(3)(c),
the
provision
which
the
state
suggests
does
not
directly
dictate
services,
first
of
all
the
solicitor
general
reads
the
statute
anew
and
suggests
that
there
may
be
direct
enforcement
against
the
carriers,
which
certainly
would
changes
our
view
of
that,
because
there
is
an
instruction
requirement
that
the
shipper
give
to
the
carrier
and
say,
state
law
mandates
this.
moreover,
we
would
like
to
point
out,
for
example,
in
the
wolens
case,
the
frequent
flyers
program
that
was
at
issue
there
was
not
a
mandatory
aspect
of
the
services,
and
also
in
the
court's
own
recent
clean
air
act
case,
where
there's
also
the
"relating
to"
language
used.
engine
manufacturers
realize
this,
that
you
can't
regulate
the
