the
answer
to
that
is
it
may
be
a
very
good
idea,
so
convince
congress
to
pass
a
law.
it's
just
that
if
every
state
does
it
differently
it's
going
to
be
a
nightmare.
and
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
point
is.
and
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
the
point
is
about
banning
things.
i'm
amazed
if
that's
what
you
mean.
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
i
mean,
north
carolina
could
pass
a
statute
that
says
the
following:
everybody
in
north
carolina
over
the
age
16,
say,
or
maybe
everybody
including
small
children...
i
don't
know
what
they
want
to
pass...
can
smoke
to
their
heart's
delight,
can
buy
as
many
cigarettes
as
they
like,
but
you
can't
ship
in
a
single
cigarette
from
out
of
state.
you
think
that
wouldn't
cause...
raise
a
commerce
clause
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
why
i'm
just
not
certain
about
bans
that
forbid
people
to
ship
things
inside
from
outside
the
state,
while
allowing
people
to
buy
those
things
produced
by
people
inside
the
state.
that's
why
i'm
uncertain
about
the
concession
you're
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
what
is
this
new
york
law
that
does
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
thing
i'm
concerned
about
is...
is
assume
it's
perfectly
legal
to
do
what
you
said.
i
guess
it
still
wouldn't
be
legal
for
maine
or
new
york
to
say
the
following:
we
really
want
to
discourage
people
from
smoking,
a
noble
goal.
and,
therefore,
whenever
an
interstate
shipper
ships
tobacco
into
the
state,
he
has
to
charge
double
the
price,
just
double
the
shipment
price
or
ten
times
the
shipment
price.
could
they
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
could
they
say
you
have
to
carry
it
in
special
packages
which
the
sticker...
which
maybe
you
should
do,
but
which
the
sticker
puts
skull
and
crossbones
on
each
of
the
packages?
could
they
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
cannot
say
either
of
those
things
because
of
the
statute,
why
can
they
say:
what
you
have
to
do
is
you
have
to
ship
it
in
a
way
that
makes
certain
that
the
person
who
receives
it,
the
addressee,
is
the
person
who
bought
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
which
is
where
i'm
having
a
little
trouble
on
your
side.
i
think
i
would
agree
and
you
would
agree
that
if
the
state
were
to
say,
to
protect
the
consumers
in
our
state,
anyone
who
ships
in
goods
must
do
so
in
special
padded
cars...
use
whatever
shipper
you
want,
but
you
have
to
have
special...
that
would
be
illegal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
california
say,
anybody
who
ships
lettuces
into
our
state
has
to
use
refrigerated
equipment?
one
product,
not
all
products,
and
a
good
public
health
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you'd
say
that
would
also
be
preempted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
--
as
part
of
its
effort
to
deregulate
trucking
industry,
congress
prohibited
states
from
enacting
any
law
"related
to
the
price,
route
or
service
of
a
motor
carrier".
now,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
federal
law
i
just
read
preempts,
i.e.
sets
aside
to
maine
tobacco
laws.
the
first
law
requires
sellers,
who
ship
tobacco
into
maine,
to
use
a
shipping
company
that
will
make
certain
that
the
person,
who
receives
and
signs
for
the
package
is
over
18,
and
is
the
same
person
as
the
one
who
brought
the
tobacco.
the
second
law
assumes
that
the
carrier
knows
that
a
package
that's
marked
in
a
certain
way
will
be
shipped
from
certain
people,
contains
tobacco
and
then
therefore
is
illegal
to
transport
under
maine
law,
under
certain
circumstances.
now,
in
our
view,
both
of
these
provisions
do
amount
for
the
state
regulation
of
a
service,
a
service
of
a
motor
carrier
and
the
federal
law
forbids
the
state
from
doing
that.
in
morales
versus
trans
world
airlines,
we
said
a
--
similar
federal
language
preempts
at
the
least
those
state
statutes
that
have
a
"connection"
with
the
services
that
carriers
provide
and
at
least
have
a
significant
negative
impact
upon
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
in
this
deregulatory
statute.
these
two
particular
maine
laws
fail
these
tests.
the
first
one
amounts
to
a
state
rule
that
requires
carriers
to
provide
a
particular
set
of
tobacco
recipient
verification
services,
it's
a
very
detailed
thing
they
have
to
provide
there
and
those
services
that
under
if
there
were
deregulation
of
services,
the
companies
would
have
their
choice
to
provide
them
or
not
as
they
chose.
so
the
maine
law
stops
them
from
having
their
services
as
you
have
to
do
it.
the
second
law
in
effect
requires
a
carrier
specially
to
check
all
the
packages
that
go
to
maine
to
see
whether
those
markings
are
there
or
not
or
who
they
were
sent
by.
again,
the
federal
statute
leaves
it
up
to
the
carriers
to
choose
whatever
checking
methods
they
want
to
choose,
subject
to
federal
regulation,
not
the
state
regulation.
this
isn't
to
say
that
the
carriers
are
automatically
exempt
from
all
state
regulation,
but
they
are
at
least
exempt
from
the
specific
detailed
state
regulation
that's
aimed
directly
at
carriers
and
designed
to
substitute
state
service
mandates
for
those
of
the
carriers
on
choice,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
maine's
primary
counter-arguments
focus
on
the
fact
that
if
the
laws
serve
desirable,
health-related
purposes,
namely
to
help
prevent
minors
from
obtaining
tobacco
and
we
assume
that
is
an
excellent
purpose,
but
still
the
federal
statute
governs
and
the
federal
statute
doesn't
provide
a
health
related
exemption.
and
if
we
try
to
read
that
into
that,
we
would
somehow
--
suddenly
permit
a
vast
web
of
state
regulation
covering
all
kinds
of
products
and
potentially
varying
from
one
state
to
another
which
his
precisely
what
congress
did
not
want.
maine
statutes
here
essentially
seek
to
conscript
the
carriers
into
maine's
efforts
to
help
--
help
them
regulate
tobacco
sales.
they
have
more
than
a
peripheral
or
indirect
effect
on
carriers.
they
don't
present
a
borderline
case.
we
consequently
need
not
decide
just
when
a
regulation's
effect
upon
carriers
is
too
remote
the
warrant
preemption.
so
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
everyone
agrees
to
that
result.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part.
