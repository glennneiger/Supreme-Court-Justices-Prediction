justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
the
post
office
have
immunity
from
maine
laws?
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
kill
people
and
all
sorts
of
stuff.
i
mean...--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
aren't
you
just
driving
all
this
business
to
the
postal
service?
i
mean,
you
know,
what
have
you
accomplished?
you'd
drive
fedex
out
of
business
if
they
choose
not
to
incur
the
additional
expense.
and
so,
you
know,
all
these
people
just
ship
it
through
the
postal
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
do
it.
i
mean,
they're
exempt
from
maine
laws.
didn't
you
know
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
i
think
that
the
reason
they
make
that
concession
is
that
they
say
you
must
prove
knowledge,
and
they're...
they're
not
concerned
about
the...
about
intentionally
transgressing
maine's
law.
what
they're
concerned
about
is
the
additional
steps
that
you
require
them
to
go
through
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
tobacco.
so
they're
not
really
worried
about
it
so
long
as
you
have
a
knowledge
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
why
they're
not
worried
about
it,
because
it's
hard
to
prove.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
because
congress
wanted
the
regulatory
void.
maybe
congress
didn't
want
these
things
to
be
enforced
by
regulating
the
transporter,
as
opposed
to
regulating
the
shipper
and
the
receiver.
as
far
as
the
game
regulation
is
concerned,
isn't
it
the
case
that
ups
won't
carry
any
game
now
because
of
the...
because
of
your
game
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
too
onerous.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you've
sort
of
driven
them
out
of
the
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
long
as
the
buyer
is
not
an
interstate
carrier,
there
is
really
no...
no
problem
of
conflicting
with
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
purpose
of
the
federal
law
was
not
to
enable
services
which
would
not
otherwise
be
provided
at
all,
but
rather
to
enable
services
to
be
provided
more
economically,
to
reduce
the
cost,
the
cost
of
interstate
transportation.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
somebody
would
come
in
to
occupy
the
void,
but
he
would
charge
a
heck
of
a
lot
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
there
would
be
a
problem?
i
don't
understand
that.
there
would
still
be
a
problem
with
uniformity
from
state
to
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
if
maine
did
it
for
all
products
it
would
be
okay?
it's
only
they're
doing
it
for
tobacco
that
makes
it
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
that
appear
in
the
materials?
do
you
remember
where
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there's
no
text,
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brinkmann,
i'm
fascinated
by
this
new
york
settlement.
you...
you
say
that...
that
maine
can't
do
this.
but
you
say
if
a
bunch
of
states
do
it,
and
they
twist
the
carriers'
arms
hard
enough
by
threatening
criminal
penalties,
so
that
the
carriers
say,
okay,
i
give
up;
and
then
they
agree
to
limit
their
transport,
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean
you're
speaking
about
the
new
york
settlement
as
though
that's
hunky-dory.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
if
this...
if
this
federal
act
means
what
it
says,
that
that
kind
of
settlement
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
the
act
did
not
want
to
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
voluntary
under
threat
of
criminal
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's...
that's
nice.
but
what
about
the
consumer?
the
act
was
not
just
for
the
convenience
of
the
carriers.
it
was
meant
to...
to
serve
the
convenience
and
the
economic
benefit
of
the
consumer.
i...
i
expect
a
consumer
might
be
able
to
challenge
that...
that
new
york
settlement.
i'm
surprised
you
accepted
it
as,
well,
you
know,
so
long
as
the
carrier
coughs
it
up,
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
into
that,
do
we
have
to
hold...
assuming
we
agree
with
you...
do
we
have
to
hold
that
the
knowing
requirement
of
the
first
sentence
is
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
the
other
provisions
are
not
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
:
okay.
i
have
a
lot
of
trouble
with
the
knowing
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
fifty
different
states
having
a
knowing
requirement
for
a
hundred
different
products...
i
don't
know
that
that
complies
with
the
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
times
50.
justice
antonin
scalia
times
50,
because
49
other
states
would
have
different
requirements,
and
all
those
requirements
might...
might
cost
only
a
penny
to
comply
with.
but
you
add
them
all
up,
and
it
is
half
a
buck.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stern,
i'd
be
interested
in
whether
you
have
any
response
to
the
government's
point
that,
at
least
as
far
as
1555-d
is
concerned,
that
is
a
direct
regulation
of...
of
the...
the
shipper...
not
the
shipper,
of
the
transporter.
so
that...
so
that
your
point
that
this
is
not
a
regulation
of...
of
transport
is
simply...
is
simply
wrong
as
far
as
1555-d
is
concerned.
do
you
acknowledge
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
