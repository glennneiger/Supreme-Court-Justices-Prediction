justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
answering
the
wrong
question?
i'll
be
candid
with
you.
i'm
not
sure
that
whatever
morales-travelers
distinction
there
is
really
counts
here,
because
the
issue
here
is
different
from
the
issue
in
some
of
the...
in
most
of
the
preemption
cases,
because
the
issue
here
starts
with
the,
i
think,
the
agreed
assumption
that
congress
wanted
to
end
a
certain
category
of
regulation.
and
the
question
is
would
congress
have
wanted,
in
effect,
to
permit
a
degree
of
state
regulation
when
it
was
for
a
particular
purpose?
and
the
question
then
is
not
whether
congress
intended
or
had
as
an
object
when
it
passed
this
statute
an
interference
with
the
state's
regulation
of
juvenile
contraband.
the
question
is
whether
it
intended
to
permit
any
regulation
with
respect
to
delivery
services
to
survive;
and
isn't
that
the
tough
question
that
you've
got
to
face?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
because
most
regulation,
you
know,
has
an
economic
purpose
involved.
but
the
ultimate
object,
it
seems
to
me,
was
to
end
the
economic
effects
of
state
patchwork
transportation
regulation.
and
therefore
i
think
the
question
you've
got
to
address
is
why
would
they
have
allowed
a
certain
category
of
regulation
that
clearly
affects
the
way
these
companies
perform
their
services
to
survive
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
regulation
was
entailed
at
the
state
level
by
the
state's
choice
to
go
against
youthful
tobacco
use?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
synar...
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me,
but
the
synar
amendment
refers
to...
to
a
number
of
objects
of
state
legislation
that
would
be
required,
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
regulating
transportation.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
we
don't
normally
think
of
a
delivery
service
as
a
distributor
of
goods.
i
mean,
we...
in
the
sense,
i
think,
that
the
statute
meant.
i...
i
read
the
synar
amendment
reference
to
distributors
as
being
wholesalers,
people
within
the
industry
who
get
the
cigarettes
from,
you
know,
the
manufacturing
point
to
the
corner
store,
as
opposed
simply
to
a
delivery
service
that
delivers
all
kinds
of
goods.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
concede
that
they
can
do
it
beyond
the
requirement,
beyond
the
force
of
the
statute
that
precludes
the
knowing
distribution.
in
other
words,
they...
they're
not
appealing
the
one
provision
of
subsection
d
that
makes
it
a
crime
knowingly
to
get
the
tobacco
into
the
hands
of
minors
and
so
on,
but
do
they
concede
anything
beyond
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
prove
it
without
a
presumption
to
start
with.
that's
what
the...
that's
way
the
issue
was
left
by
the
district
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stern,
when
you
say
that
it
takes
one
second
to...
i
forget
whether
you
said
scan
or...
or
examine
a
label,
do
you...
are
you
describing
simply
the
physical
act
of
a
human
being
looking
at
the
label?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can't
tell
unless
you
have
an
extraordinary
memory
for
all
the
names
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
you
can't
do
that
simply
by
looking
at
the
label.
and
i...
i
thought
maybe
what
you
meant
by
the
one
second
was
that
the
list
was...
was
in
a
computer,
and
you
had
a
mechanical
device
that
scanned
the...
the
name
on
the
label
and...
and
it
either
matched
something
in
the
computer,
or
it
didn't.
but
i
take
it
you
are
talking
about
physical,
visual
inspection.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i...
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
you
meant
by
the
"one
second".
i
take
it
what
you
mean
is
there
is
a
physical,
visual
inspection
of
the
label.
and
in
that
one
second,
in
practical
terms,
the
person
looking
can
tell
whether
the
name
is
on
the
attorney
general's
list,
because
there
will
be
some
tipoff
in
the...
in
the
name
of
the
company
that...
that
will
alert
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
someone
on
the
unapproved
list
wants
to...
for
whatever
reason,
wants
to
avoid
a
tipoff
term
like
incorporating
the
term
"tobacco"
on
to
their
label,
then
the
person
making
the
one-second
inspection
is
not
going
to
pick
it
up.
and
the
only
way
the
company
is
going
to
be
able
to
protect
itself
against
the
imputed
knowledge
is
either
by
a
visual
inspection
of
the
attorney
general's
list
to
see
whether
it
matches
what
the
person
is
looking
at
or
by
some
computer
scan,
right?
