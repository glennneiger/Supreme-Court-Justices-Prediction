mr.
stern,
can
i
ask
you
this
question:
to
what
extent
are
we
dealing
with
a
tobacco
problem
or
a
broader
problem?
do
you
have
other
products
that
are
contraband
such
as...
or
have
special
restrictions
on
who
can
ship
wild
animals,
prescription
drugs,
firearms;
or
are
there
other
products
that
you
regulate
in
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
allow
shippers
to
ship
firearms
and
poisonous
substances
without
having
this
kind
of
restriction
on
it,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
really
see
why
the
states
have...
have
a
different
interest
in
regulating
shipment
of
tobacco
to
minors
than
they
would
a
variety
of
other
substances
that
could
be
harmful
to
minors
or
contraband
in
general.
and
you
don't
try
to
regulate
any
of
those?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by...
by
regulating
how
they
may
be
shipped,
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
the
alcohol
point,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
relevance
of
the
21st
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
can
pre-empt...
if
federal
law
can
pre-empt
state
laws
that
are
authorized
by
the
21st
amendment,
i
don't
understand
how
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
preemption
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
it
still
a
state
regulation
of
shipping,
even
if
it's
a
law
that's
authorized
by
the
21st
amendment?
i
don't
see
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
a
new
carrier
said,
well,
i'd
like
to
get
into
the
business
of
shipping
tobacco
products,
none
of
the
other
companies
want
to
do
it,
i
want
to
form...
i'll
form
my
own
company.
it
will
meet
all
these
requirements.
would
it...
would
it
then
be
pre-empted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
saying
the
retailer
must
use
a
service
that
fulfills
these
qualifications.
and
if
there
are
services
out
there,
why
would
the
law
be
pre-empted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
the
effect
on
ups;
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
foreclose
the
possibility
that
somebody
else
might
just
specialize
in
delivering
tobacco
products,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
are
presumed
to
have
read
the
label,
the
stamp
on
the
label;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
answer
my
question?
may
they
presume
that
if
the
package
is
labeled
cigarettes,
that
the
delivery...
the
delivery
person
knows
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
they
pick
up
the
package,
they
don't
look
at
the
labels?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
statute
is
definitely
preemptive.
a
state
cannot
insist
on
that.
could
they
insist
on
firearms
being
slipped
only
in
labeled
packages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
state
do
it
beyond
the
federal
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
it's
akin
to
the
health
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it's
akin
to
a
health
exception.
