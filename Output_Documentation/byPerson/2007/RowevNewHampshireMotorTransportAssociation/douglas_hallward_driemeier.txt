mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
there's
no
question
that
the
state
of
maine
could
not
require
carriers
to
obtain
a
license
to
deliver
tobacco
products
and
condition
that
upon
the
carrier's
service
complying
with
the
mandates
of
state
law,
that
that
would
be
a
law
that
relates
to
the
carrier's
service.
now,
maine
maintains
that
its
law
is
saved
from
preemption
because
of
two
distinctions:
one,
it
that
is
adopted
with
a
health
rather
than
economic
purpose,
and
because
it
operates
directly
on
the
shipper
rather
than
the
carrier.
and
we
don't
think
that
either
of
those
arguments
is
consistent
with
the
text,
structure,
or
legislative
history
of
the
act.
but
i
would
want
to
point--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
federal
act.
that's
right.
but
it's
worth
noting
that
those
arguments,
in
any
event,
only
go
to
the
provision
in
c(3)(c).
the
provision
that
is
under
dispute
in
section
d
does
not
have
either
of
those
characteristics.
it
operates
directly
on
the
carrier,
and
it
is
not
adopted
for
the
health
concern
but
rather
to
support
the
state's
licensing
and
tax
purposes.
but
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
reasons
why
their
argument
is
inconsistent
with
the
text,
structure,
and
history
of
the
federal
act,
as
respondents'
counsel
noted,
congress
did
consider
an
alternative
version
of
this
bill,
one
that
was
limited
to
economic
regulation,
and
the
congress
rejected
the
senate
version
and
adopted
instead
the
house
version
that
much
more
broadly
pre-empted
state
regulation
related
to
carrier
services.
it
added
the
provision
of
services
and
adopted
the
"related
to"
standard
rather
than
regulation.
and
so
it
has
rejected
this
limitation
that
petitioners
urge.
moreover,
the
argument
that
there
is
a
general
health
exception
to
the
pre-emptive
force
of
the
faaaa
is
inconsistent
with
the
structure
of
the
act.
there
are
specific
exceptions
in
the
act
related,
for
example,
to
motor
carrier
safety,
but
those
exceptions
correspond
to
other
grants
of
authority
to
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
adopt
regulations
and
to
pre-empt
state
regulations
that
would
interfere
with
interstate
commerce
or
impose
too
much
of
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
there
is
no
similar
back
top,
if
the
court
reads
into
the
faaaa
a
textual
general
exception
for
any
act
adopted
with
a
health
purpose
by
the
states.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
what
congress...
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
act
was
that
carriers
would
respond
to
the
marketplace,
not
state
regulation.
and
where
a
service
is
widely
available
in
response
to
the
marketplace,
for
a
state
to
dictate
to
shippers
that
they
should
use
one
service
as
opposed
to
another,
we
think
would
have...
it
would
be
a
different
analysis
under
morales.
the
court
in
morales
said
that
the
test
was
whether
there
was
a
significant
effect
on
the
carriers.
and
where,
as
here,
we
have
the
three
major
carriers
all
providing,
for
example,
an
adult-signature-required
service,
for
the...
for
a
state
to
say,
well,
when
you
ship
alcohol,
you
have
to
use
that
available
service,
that
would
not
have
much
of
an
effect
at
all
on
the
carriers.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
in
fact,
the
federal
law--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
right.
we
don't
think
the
state
can
adopt
a
law
and
in
a
sense
force
the
carriers
to
conform
their
services
to
the
state
law
and
then
say,
oh,
but
now
they
have
it.
we
don't
think
that
would
be
conducive--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
think
with
respect
to
this
particular
example
about
the
adult
signature
required,
the
court
probably
would
need
to
go
no
farther
than
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
itself
recognized
the
existence
of
that
service
and
required
it
in
a
law
that
relates
to
the
shipping
of
wine
when
one
is
prohibited
by
safety
regulations
from
taking
it
on
the
airplane
with
them.
so
the
existence
in
the
marketplace
of
this
service
has
already
recognized
in
federal
law.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i
have
not
studied
the
new
york
statute
sufficiently
to
speak
to
that,
and
i
don't
think
the
government
has
a
position
about
that.
we
do
believe...
the
settlement
agreement,
though,
is
distinct
from
the
maine
law
in
some
very
significant
respects.
and
the
most
important
of
those
is
that
under
the
settlement
agreement,
the
carriers
agree
to
use
reasonable
best
efforts;
whereas
the
maine
provision...
this
is
the
second
sentence
of
d...
deems
the
carrier
to
have
knowledge--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
have
some
familiarity
with
it.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i...
your
honor,
we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
whether
the
settlement
is
and,
with
respect...
although
i
have
familiarity
with
the
settlement,
i
have
less
familiarity
with
the
underlying
new
york
statute
that
it
was
agreed
to,
in
response
to--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--yes.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
in
our
view,
where,
as
construed
by
the
first
circuit...
and
we
sort
of
accept
that
view...
the
first
circuit,
on
page
26
of
the
pet.
app.,
construed
the
first
sentence
of
d
as
requiring
that
carriers
do
not
act
as
knowing
accomplices
in
the
illegal
sale
of
tobacco
products.
so
construed,
we
don't
believe
that
that
provision
is
pre-emptive.
it
is
akin
to
the
general
prohibition
on
furnishing
tobacco
to
minors
in
1555-b(2),
and
we
don't
think
that
that
provision
is
pre-emptive.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
excuse
me.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no.
i...
i
say
that
it
is
a
law
of
general
applicability,
and
it
does
not
require
any
change
in
the
carriers'
practices.
what...
what
the
imputation
of
knowledge
does,
however,
is
require
the
carriers
to
change
their
practices
so
that
they
will
get
the
knowledge
when
they
can.
for
example,
take
another
example.
if
maine
said
that
it
would
impute
knowledge
to
the
carriers
of
the
tobacco
contents
if
an
x-ray
scan
would
reveal
the
cigarette
contents,
it
would
in
effect
be
requiring
the
carriers
to
install
x-ray
machines
and
pass
every
package
that
they
get
through
those
x-ray
machines.
that's
how
an
imputation
of
knowledge
can
be
used
to
direct
the
conduct
of
the
carrier,
and
that's
what
is
so
problematic
about
the
second
sentence
of
d.
they
impute
knowledge
based
upon
whether
the
name
of
the
shipper
appears
on
a
confidential
list
that
the
attorney
general
has
provided.
in
other
words,
even
though,
in
their
normal
practices,
they
don't
pay
attention
whatsoever
to
the
shipper's
name,
they
have
to
incorporate
that
into
their
practices
in
order
to
avoid
the
imputation
of
knowledge.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
yes,
your
honor.
a
federal
law...
there
is
federal
law
with
respect
to
shipment
of
hazardous
substances.
there
are
uniform
requirements
with
respect
to
how
one
must
label
hazardous
substances,
but--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
as
i
understand
it,
the...
the
uniformity
of
the
symbol
for
hazardous
substance
is
something
that
the
handlers
are
trained
to
scan
for.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--not
necessarily,
as
i
understand
the
service.
some
of...
many,
many
of
the
packages
are
delivered
to
a
company
with
which
ups
has
a
contract,
such
as
a
staples
or
some
other
kind
of
store.
and
it
becomes...
the
staples
store
becomes
the
shipper.
they
are
the
ones
with
the
contract
with
ups,
not
whoever
it
was
that
brought
to
it
staples.
so
it
is
not
necessarily
part
of
their
practice
that
they
would
have
that
information
at
all.
