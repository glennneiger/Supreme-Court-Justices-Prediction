chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
06-457,
rowe
v.
new
hampshire
motor
transport
association.
mr.
stern.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
certainly
that
may
be
true,
but
it
certainly
relates
to
the
service
of
a
carrier.
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
we
can't
read
that
language
literally.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
talks
about
what
carriers
have
to
do,
so...
in
connection
with
delivery,
so
it
relates
to
the
service
of
the
motor
carrier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
dictate
what
they
have
to
do.
they
can
get
out
of
the
business.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
also
considered
it
in
morales,
and
i
thought
this
law
was
enacted
in
the
immediate
wake
of
morales,
which
adopted
a
much
broader
reading
of
erisa
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stern.
ms.
brinkmann.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
talking
about
the
federal
act
or
the
maine
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
follow
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
though,
and
specifically,
do
you
think
the
new
york
settlement,
if
the
carriers
did
not
agree
to
it,
that
they
would
nonetheless
prevail
because
the
terms
of
it
are
pre-emptive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
see,
you
are...
you
are
pretty
familiar
with
the
new
york
settlement
then.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
i
think
you
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
me
whether
you
think
it's
pre-empted
by
the
federal
law
under
your
theory
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
have
familiarity
with
the
knowing
delivery
requirement
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
pre-emptive
under
your
view?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
mr.
stern,
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stern.
the
case
is
submitted.
