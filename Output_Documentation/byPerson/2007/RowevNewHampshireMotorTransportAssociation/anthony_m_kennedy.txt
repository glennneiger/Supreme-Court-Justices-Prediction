ms.
brinkmann,
i'm
interested
in
two
things.
number
one,
i
want
to
make
sure
you
completed
the
quantification
point
that
you
made,
and
you
pointed
us
to
someplace
in
the
record,
because
the
petitioner
said,
oh,
it
just
costs
a
penny
a
package
or
something
like
that.
and
then
the
second
point,
i
think
probably
not
related,
is
the
question
of
knowledge.
i
take
it
you're
not
contesting
if
there's
actual
knowledge
that
it's
a
minor
that
there
can
be
a
prosecution.
i'm
not
sure
how
that
works
if
the
company...
because
of
the
imputed
knowledge.
suppose
an
officer
of
the
company
or
some
shipping
clerk
knows
it.
wouldn't
the
company
be
liable
if
the
company
were
subject
to...
those
are
two
different
questions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
on
the
knowledge
point,
i'm
still
not
sure.
i
don't
want
to
ask
you
if
you
concede
that
knowing
delivery
would
make
you
liable.
that's
what
the
first
circuit
said.
i
suppose
that's
not
before
us,
so
i
have
to
take
that
as
a
premise,
as
a
given.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
little
bit
hard
to
write
the
opinion
your
way
with
that,
with
that
concession.
that's
my
problem.
or
with
that
premise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
way...
i'm
telling
you
i
assume
the
way
it
works
is
that
the
ups
truck
goes
out
to
the
tobacco
warehouse
and
picks
up
4,000
boxes,
all
registered
tobacco.
he
certainly
knows
it's
tobacco
at
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
that
knowledge
requirements
have
a
different
preemption
analysis?
that's
what
i'm
finding
that
difficult
to
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
that's
clear
preemption
in
justice
breyer's
example.
if
california
says
you
must
ship
certain
products
in
refrigerated
containers,
that
is
definitely
preempted
under
your
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
rather
odd
that
major
carriers
can
determine
the
scope
of
pre-emption.
suppose
there
are
smaller
carriers
that
say
we
don't
want
to
do
this.
take
the
new
york
settlement
example.
if
the
new
york
settlement
example,
in
effect,
opens
up
a
new
kind
of
service,
all
other
carriers
have
to
follow
that?
that's
a...
there's
no
authority
in
our
cases
for
that
kind
of
pre-emption
analysis,
is
there?
