justice

but
what
if
every...
what
if
every
state
enacted
a
slightly
different
law
relating
to
this
and
a
slightly
different
law
relating
to
every
other
product
that
they
might
want
to
restrict
for
health
or
safety
reasons?
would
you...
would
you
agree
then
with
the
respondent
that
there
would
be
just
the
kind
of
patchwork
of
regulation
at
the
state
level
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
stop?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
one
of
the
big
carriers
decides
for
its
own
business
purposes
to
offer
a
service
that
complied
with
the
maine
law,
would
that
have
the
effect
of
"un-pre-empting"
the
maine
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
if
the
law--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--even
if
they
all
now
decided
they
wanted
to
go
into
this
business,
that
would
have
no
effect
because
they
would
have
done
that
to
comply
with
the
maine
law
rather
than
as...
in
response
to
the
marketplace?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
won't
the
name
of
the
shipper
be
in
their
computer
program?
i
mean,
the
shipper
has
to
pay,
right?
well,
they
know
the
name
of
the
shipper--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
#
and
they
have
a
supercomputer
so
i
don't
understand
why
not
necessarily--
