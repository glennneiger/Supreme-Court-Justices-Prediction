justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it...
i
should
know
this,
but
i
don't.
imagine
that
jones
and
smith,
civil
engineers,
builders,
enter
into
a
contract.
they
have
an
arbitration
provision
suspiciously
like
this
one.
it
says
we
promise
to
arbitrate
everything,
any
dispute,
including
a
dispute
about
whether
this
agreement
is
legal
or
not
itself.
they
have
that.
they
go
to
the
arbitrator.
jones
says:
you
know,
mr.
arbitrator,
you
don't
know
that
much
about
civil
engineering,
but
there's
a
judge
here
who
does.
so
i
think
what
i'm
going
to
do
tomorrow
is
file
a
lawsuit
in
the
superior
court
in
california
making
the
same
claims
i'm
making
here
and
maybe
that
judge
will
decide
it
first
and
then
you'll
be
really
helped.
now
what
stops
him
from
doing
that
in
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
federal...
the
federal
arbitration
act
says
what
that
makes
it
clear
he
can't
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
grant
you
if
he
can
do
it
you
might
as
well
tear
up
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
throw
it
out
the
window.
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
is
it
in
the
law
specifically
that
stops
him
from
doing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
even
though
it's
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
but
that...
that's
what
i'm
driving
at,
and
i
think
that's
interesting,
that
there's
an
implicit...
because
it
doesn't
say
it
explicitly...
there's
an
implicit
promise
not
to
undermine
this
contract
by
running
off
to
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
so
you
can't...
no
case
comes
to
your
mind
where
anybody
has
tried
that
little
end
run?
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
agree,
i
don't
see
how
they
could,
but
i
just
want
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
question
is
obvious.
the
question
just
follows
from
what
i
said.
you
were
there
nodding
your
head
when
everybody
seems
seemed
to
agree
that
the
jones
versus
smith,
they
can't
go
run
off
to
court.
so
you're
just
about
to
address
this,
and
i
hope
you'll
include
the
answer
to
the
question,
which
is
if
they
can't
run
off
to
the
federal...
to
the
state
court
judge,
the
superior
court
judge,
to
get
his
opinion
on
the
matter,
why
can
they
run
off
to
this
man,
namely
the
talent
agency
expert--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
happens
to
be
an
administrative
agency?
why
does
it
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
sounds
as
if
you
made
the
argument...
well,
you
say
we
cited
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
the
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
is
no,
we
didn't
raise
it
below.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
california
law
do
this?
i
mean
could
they
say,
you
know,
we
have
a
problem.
by
the
way,
this
is
just
a
hypothetical.
we
think
that
our
judges
in
the
superior
court
don't
know
very
much
about
building
disputes.
now,
i
say
it
is
a
hypothetical
because,
in
fact,
superior
court
judges
in
california
are
excellent
judges.
but
california
thinks,
no,
they
don't
know
enough
about
it.
so
here's
what
we
do.
we
say
when
jones
and
smith
enter
into
an
arbitration
agreement,
if
it
happens
to
concern
a
building
dispute,
they
have
to
go
to
federal...
they
can
go
to
the
superior
court.
in
fact,
if
they
want
to,
if
one
of
them
wants
to,
the
other
one
doesn't.
and
everything
is
delayed
while
the
superior
court
judge
decides
all
the
issues
in
the
case.
and
then
after
they
can
go
back
to
arbitration,
if
of
course
they
still
want
to.
could
california
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
read
the
agreement,
and
i
don't
quite
find
their...
here--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
my
mind
is
what
they
do
is
they
have
the
same
standard
arbitration
clause.
so
i'm
asking
not
about
the
parties;
i'm
asking
about
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
answer
is
no.
i
thought
so.
and
so
now
you
explain
to
me
how
this
is
any
different
than
what
i
just
said,
other
than
substituting
the
words
"labor
commissioner"
for
"california
superior
court"
and
substituting
the
words
"talent
dispute"
for
the
words
"building
dispute".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
guess
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
arbitrator.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
this
is...
this
is...
actually
now
we
are
getting
to
the
bottom
of
something
here,
i
think.
now,
i
am
beginning
to
understand
where
you
are
coming
from;
and
volt
does
offer
you
considerable
support,
as
i...
as
i
agreed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
volt,
however,
is
a
case,
i
take
it,
in
which
the
stay
that
was
entered
was
a
stay
staying
the
arbitration
pending
the
resolution
of
a
judicial
dispute
that
was
not
subject
to
arbitrability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
here
concerns
the
meaning
of
this
contract,
and
that's
where
we
started.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
this
contract
mean
that
the
parties
who
entered
have
promised,
one,
not
themselves
to
go
to
court?
answer:
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
two,
not
themselves
to
bring
a
proceeding
before
this
administrative
agency?
and
that's
where
he
says
yes,
and
you
say
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
is
the
proper
resolution
of
that
to
say:
well,
you
can
raise
that,
too,
before
the
arbitrator?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
regardless
of
the...
i
now
understand
better
than
i
did
what
i
take
as
a
pretty
strong
argument.
i'm
not
saying
convincing,
but
strong.
and
that
would
be
this:
if
you
go
look
at
volt,
and
in
volt
the
court
said
that
the
california
code
meant
that
the
individual
who'd
entered
into
the
arbitration
contract
could
go
and
can
ask
a
superior
court
to
stay
an
arbitration
while
some
unrelated...
some
unrelated...
i
mean
directly
related
but
not
the
same
parties...
litigation
took
place.
the
court
didn't
in
volt
say
that
that
question
of
interpreting
this
contract
is
for
the
arbitrator.
i
don't
know
why
it
didn't.
but
it
didn't.
now
here
he's
making
a
parallel
argument.
he's
saying
that
the
california
code
says
that
people
should
first
go
to
that
labor
commissioner
and
that
you
can
stay
arbitration
while
that
goes
on.
now...
and
i
say
well,
why
don't
you
go
to
the
arbitrator?
he
says
i
don't
want
to
go
to
the
arbitrator
on
that
one,
but
he
points
to
volt.
and
so
the
puzzle
is
this:
if
the
court
in
volt
didn't
say
this
is
a
matter
for
the
arbitrator,
whether
the
contract
really
means
that
you
promise
not
to
go
into
court
and
make
a
motion
to
stay,
why
here
is
it
a
matter
for
the
arbitrator
whether
you
implicitly
promised
not
to
go
into
court
and
asked
him
to
stay
pending
the
outcome
of
this
administrative
proceeding?
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i...
i
accept
that.
i
see
a
lot
of
common
sense
on
your
side
of
it.
but
imagine
i'm
writing
an
opinion
in
your
favor
and
now
i
come
to
the
following
paragraph
which
i
have
to
write:
"your
opponent
says
that
volt
controls
here;
but
that
is
wrong
because.
"
--and
now
fill
in
the
blank
for
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i'm
just
saying
i
have
to
write.
i
see
all
the
common
sense
of
your
position.
i...
absolutely.
but
to
get...
you
only
need
one
really
good
argument.
and
he's
saying
whatever
the
other
ones
are,
here
breyer
or
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
write
the
words,
and
volt
is
different
because...
so
i
would
like
some
help
on
that
one.
