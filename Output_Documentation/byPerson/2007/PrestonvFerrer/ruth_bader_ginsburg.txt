justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
may
have
a
right
to
go
to
arbitration
under
this
context,
to
proceed
at
once
to
arbitration.
but
could
you
stop
a
parallel
proceeding
from
going
on
before
the
labor
commission?
in
other
words,
your
adversary
says
under
the
arbitration
contract
i'm
stuck,
i
have
to
arbitrate
at
once,
but
i
can
go
to
the
labor
commission;
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
that
says
i
can't
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
arbitrator
decide,
i
know
i'm
not
required
to
do
this
but
the
labor
commissioner
is
the
expert
and
i'd
rather
wait
until
the
labor
commissioner
acted
before
i
proceed
with
the
arbitration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
take
out
the
exception.
the
arbitrator
just
thinks
that
it
would
be
good
to
have
the
advice
of
the
labor
commissioner
because
the
arbitrator
is
not
so
familiar
with
these
talent
agency
arrangements.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
buckeye
was...
was
such
a
case,
going
to
court
despite
the
arbitration
agreement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
volt
involves
a
third
party
who
is
not
party
to
the
arbitration
agreement.
you
have
a
party
who
is
bound
nonetheless
invoking
the
labor
commission
to
avoid
going
immediately
to
arbitration.
volt
is
very
clear.
it
involves
a
third
party,
litigation
involving
a
third
party
who
is
not
bound
by
the
arbitration
agreement.
here
you
have
only
two
parties.
they
are
both
bound
by
the
arbitration
agreement.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
invoke
volt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
litigation
involving
a
person
who
couldn't
be
brought
into
the
arbitration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
piece
of
it
involving
a
party
who
can't
be
before
the
arbitrator
should
be...
should
be...
go
first.
but
here
you
don't
have
anybody
who
isn't
bound
to
go
before
the
arbitrator.
you
have
no
third
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
something
about
that
in
your
brief,
and
i
think
that
you
got
it
wrong.
you
said
something
about...
that
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
can
have
preclusive
effect
in
the
arbitration.
but
that
would
be
so
only
if
the
result
favored
the
non
party
to
the
litigation,
because
the
non
party
to
the
litigation
cannot
be
bound
by
a
judgment
that
would
adversely
affect
that
party's
interest.
that
party
wasn't
in
the
proceeding.
it
isn't
bound
by
it.
the
parties
to
the
litigation
are
bound
by
it,
not
the
non
parties
to
the
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
de
novo
right
in
superior
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
brunstad,
i'm
looking
at
the
point
in
which
you
said
this
in
your
brief.
you
said
you
go
to
the
labor
commission,
and
then
you
go
to
the
superior
court.
this
is
page
13
of
your
brief.
the
court
is
required
to
grant
a
motion
compelling
arbitration
if
the
parties
have
executed
a
valid
and
applicable
arbitration
agreement.
well,
who
determines
if
the
parties
have
executed
a
valid
and
applicable
arbitration
agreement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
know...
this
is
not
a
mystery
in
this
contract.
it
says
it
in
the
contract,
and
it
says
it
under
the
aaa
rules.
but
you
phrased
this
in
your
brief
in
a
way
that
says,
well,
if
the
parties
have
executed
a
valid
and
applicable
arbitration
agreement,
that's
what
the
superior
court
is
going
to
decide.
so
it
won't
grant
a
motion
to
compel
unless
it
determines
that
the
parties
have
executed
the
valid
and
applicable
arbitration
agreement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
related
litigation
with
someone
other
than
the
parties
that
you
bound
yourself
to
arbitrate
with.
that
involved
stanford
and
two
companies,
stanford
suing
two
companies
or...
in
litigation
with
two
companies
with
whom
it
had
no
arbitration
agreement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
that
light,
on
page
43,
you
say
in
this
case,
it
is
undisputed
that
preston
was
an
unlicensed
talent
agent
and
that
the
contract
he
drafted
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
section
1700.
i
thought
it
is
very
much
disputed
whether
he
was
a
talent
agent
at
all.
i
thought
the
position
was...
that
your
opponent
is
taking
is
that
he
was
not
a
talent
agent,
that
he
didn't
come
under
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what
you
said
here.
you
say
it
is
undisputed
that
preston
was
an
unlicensed
talent
agent.
that's
your
statement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i
just
read
you,
this
one,
you
said
it
isn't.
you
say
it
is
undisputed
that
preston
was
an
unlicensed
talent
agent.
and
you
just
admitted
that
that
is
disputed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what
you
represented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
not
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
administrative
agency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
an
agency
like
the
eeoc
waffle
house.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
somebody
who's
bound
by
arbitration
invoking
whatever
authority
the
labor
commissioner
has,
quite
different
from
the
labor
commissioner
commencing
a
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
federal
arbitration
act
which
establishes
a
national
policy
in
favor
of
arbitration
when
parties
contract
for
that
mode
of
dispute
resolution.
the
parties
here
who
chose
arbitration
as
the
means
to
settle
disputes
under
their
contract
are
respondent,
alex
ferrer,
a
former
florida
judge
who
appears
on
television
as
judge
alex,
and
petitioner
arnold
preston,
a
lawyer
who
renders
services
to
persons
in
the
entertainment
industry.
when
preston
sought
fees
that
ferrer
refused
to
pay,
preston
demanded
arbitration
under
the
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association
as
specified
in
the
ferrer-preston
contract.
ferrer
responded
by
petitioning
the
california
labor
commissioner
for
a
declaration
that
preston
had
violated
california's
talent
agencies
act
by
acting
as
a
talent
agent
without
the
license
california
law
required.
that
alleged
violation,
ferrer
asserted,
made
the
ferrer-preston
contract
unenforceable.
ferrer
asked
the
california
trial
court
for
an
injunction
against
the
arbitration,
pending
the
labor
commissioner's
decision
on
the
legality
of
the
contract.
preston
opposed
the
injunction
and
asked
the
california
court
to
order
immediate
arbitration.
the
threshold
question
on
which
this
case
turns,
who
has
initial
authority
to
decide
whether
preston
acted
as
an
unlicensed
talent
agent,
the
labor
commissioner
or
an
arbitrator?
the
california
trial
court
held
that
under
california
law,
the
labor
commissioner
had
primary
authority
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
a
two-to-one
decision.
the
california
appeals
court
acknowledged
that
this
court's
--
this
court
had
clearly
ruled
that
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
questions
concerning
the
validity
of
a
contract
with
an
arbitration
clause
ought
to
be
decided
in
the
first
instance
by
an
arbitrator,
not
by
a
court.
this
case
is
different,
the
california
court
held,
because
california
law
vests
exclusive
original
jurisdiction
in
an
administrative
agency,
the
labor
commissioner,
not
in
a
court.
for
reasons
detailed
in
our
opinion,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeals,
and
hold
that
when
parties
agree
to
arbitrate
all
questions
arising
under
their
contracts,
state
law
lodging
primary
jurisdiction
in
another
forum,
whether
judicial
or
administrative
are
superseded
by
the
federal
arbitration
act.
ferrer
urged
us
to
hold
that
the
provision
of
california's
talent
agencies
act
vesting
original
jurisdiction
in
the
labor
commissioner
is
compatible
with
the
federal
arbitration
act
because
california's
law
merely
postpones
and
does
not
exclude
eventual
arbitration.
but
under
ferrer's
scenario,
arbitration,
if
it
ever
occurred
after
the
labor
commissioner's
first
instance
decision,
would
likely
be
long
delayed.
congress
designed
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
avoid
delay,
parties
who
agreed
to
an
arbitral
forum
are
to
be
moved
into
that
forum
as
quickly
and
easily
as
possible.
ferrer
also
stressed
that
in
addition
to
an
arbitration
clause,
his
contract
with
preston
contained
the
choice-of-law
clause
calling
for
the
application
of
california
law.
but
in
a
prior
decision,
we
claimed
that
the
best
way
to
harmonize
a
choice-of-law
clause
with
an
arbitration
clause
calling
for
proceedings
under
prescribed
rules
such
as
those
of
the
american
arbitration
association
is
this,
“read
the
choice-of-law
clause
to
refer
to
state
substantive
law
of
principles,
but
not
to
prescriptions
limiting
the
arbitrator's
authority
as
decision
maker.”
so
here,
the
talent
agencies
act
provides
substantive
law
relevant
to
the
controversy,
but
that
law
is
to
be
applied
by
the
arbitrator
under
procedures
that
are
in
the
american
arbitration
association
rules.
thus,
the
california
court
of
appeals
erred
in
staying
arbitration
and
in
declaring
the
labor
commissioner
first-line
decision
maker.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
