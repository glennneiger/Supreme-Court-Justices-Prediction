why
isn't
that
an
issue
in
the
case,
unless
you're
waiving
the
issue?
wouldn't
it
be
a
question
of
contract
interpretation
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
choice
of
law
provision
that
should
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator?
unless
you
want
to
waive
that
argument.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

is
there
any
california
case
that
says
that
this
works
this
way?
that
after
the
proceeding
is
finished
before
the
labor
commissioner,
the
parties
have
a
right
to
go
to
arbitration
before
there's
de
novo
review
in
the
superior
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
a
question
of
contract
interpretation--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--for
the
arbitrator?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
we
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
simply
an
arbitration
postponing
rule
when
there's
no
california
case
that
says
that,
do
you
acknowledge?
and
a
party
resisting
arbitration
could
well
argue
that
the
california
code
means
that
you
go
first
to
the
labor
commissioner
and
then,
as
the
statute
says
explicitly,
the
parties
are
entitled
to
a
de
novo
review
before
the
superior
court
without
making
any
provision
for
arbitration.
do
you
think
it
is
inconceivable
the
california
courts
could
interpret
the
statute
to
mean
that,
that
there's
no
room
for
arbitration
in
the...
in
this
scheme?
