mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
been
a
little
less
than
two
years
since
this
court
handed
down
the
decision
in
buckeye
check
cashing
service
v.
cardegna.
within
nine
months
after
buckeye
was
decided,
the
california
court
of
appeal
issued
its
decision
in
this
case
excising
the
issue
of
validity
or
legality
of
a
contract
from
an
entire
category
of
arbitrations,
declaring
it
off
limits
to
arbitration.
the
contract
in
this
case
couldn't
be
more
clear.
it
states
quite
specifically
that
the
validity
or
legality
of
the
contract
shall
be
arbitrated.
so
there
was
no
consideration
given
to
the
intent
of
the
parties.
the
federal
arbitration
act,
of
course,
applies
in
this
case.
there
was
never
really
a
dispute
about
that,
because
it's
a
contract
between
the
citizens
of
two
states
and
it
was
never
disputed
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
apply.
if
left
standing,
the
decision
in
this
case
could
result
in
a
multiplicity
of
state
law
decisions
and
statutes
eliminating
arbitration
in
entire
classes
of
cases
through
the
mere
expediency
of
having
it
go
to
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
well,
the
assertion
that
we
get
to
arbitrate
de
novo
is
new
in
this
court.
in
the
courts
below
the
parties
agreed,
and
both
sides
briefed,
the
fact
that
the
de
novo
would
be
heard
by
the
superior
court,
not
by
the
arbitrator.
i
don't
know
what...
by
what
magical
process
the
respondent
would
think
that
we
would
get
to
arbitrate
the
de
novo,
because
the
statute
on
which
the
court
of
appeal
based
its
jurisdictional
holding,
labor
code
section
1700.44,
that's
where
the
labor
commissioner
gets
jurisdiction
from
the
same
statute
and
says
the
superior
court
hears
the
de
novo.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
well,
we
have
brought
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration,
which
was
denied
based
on
1700.44.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
the
injunction
states...
and
i'm
implying
this,
because
it
doesn't
actually
state
how
long
it
lasts...
the
injunction
was
requested
and
it
was
granted
with
just
the
word
"grant".
so
i
interpret
it
as
meaning
that
what
was
granted
was
what
was
requested,
and
what
was
requested
was
an
injunction
that
would
last
until
the
labor
commissioner
determined
that
she
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
now,
since
the
labor
commissioner
had
already
determined
that
she
does
have
jurisdiction,
it's
effectively
permanent
or,
as
you
say,
justice
kennedy,
until
the
court
vacates
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
well,
they
actually
had
in
a
sense
an
opportunity
to
do
exactly
that
and
chose
not
to.
the
motion
for
reconsideration
was
brought
before
the
labor...
before
the
arbitrator
one
day
before
the
injunction
hearing.
the
arbitrator
said:
well,
it's
inefficient
to
have
parallel
proceedings
and
maybe
i
can
benefit
from
the
labor
commissioner's
advice
in
this.
so
while
retaining
his
jurisdiction,
he
said:
i'm
going
to
stay
the
arbitration
until
the
labor
commissioner
rules.
now,
at
that
point
the
respondent
could
have
simply
withdrawn
the
injunction
and
said,
fine,
we'll
do
it
the
way
the
arbitrator
says;
what
the
arbitrator
wants,
the
arbitrator
shall
get.
instead,
the
next
day
the
arbitrator's
decision
became
moot.
now,
i
think
the
arbitrator,
acting
with
an
injunction
looming
the
next
day,
was
proposing
in
a
sense
a
kind
of
compromise:
you
can
both
have
a
little
bit
of
what
you
want.
it's
not
unusual
in
arbitrations
for
that
to
happen.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
if
the
motion
to
compel
arbitration
had
been
granted...
remember
there
were
two
motions
pending,
my
motion
to
compel
arbitration
and
the
respondent's
motion
for
an
injunction
to
stop
the
arbitration.
if
the
motion
to
compel
arbitration
had
been
granted,
i
think
that
would
have
been
in
effect
a
mandamus
to
judge
ferrer
that
he
had
to
arbitrate
and
not
proceed.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
justice
scalia,
i
would
certainly
agree
that
it's
a
breach
of
the
contract
to
file
a
parallel
proceeding.
the
question,
of
course,
is
specific
performance.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
well,
justice
souter,
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
my
first
is
that,
since
there's
an
express
agreement
to
arbitrate
validity
or
legality,
that
there
is
certainly
no
basis
for
saying
that
there's
some
implied
intent
to
contradict
the
express
agreement.
the
second
is
that,
assuming
for
a
moment
that
we
have
incorporated
california
law
wholesale,
and
california
has
a
lot
of
law,
one
of
the
laws
that
california
has,
as
set
forth
in
the
case
i
cited,
qualcomm
v.
nokia,
a
federal
circuit
decision
in
2006
under
california
law,
california
law
has
a
rule
that
if
you
incorporate
the
aaa
rules
into
your
agreement,
you
meet
the
first
option
standard
that
you
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
arbitrability.
now,
if
we
have
incorporated
california
law,
we
have
incorporated
the
law
that
says
the
arbitrator's
decision,
his
initial
decision
saying
i've
got
jurisdiction,
let's
hear
some
evidence,
then
that's
incorporated
in
california
law--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--i
don't
believe
that
volt
is
properly
in
the
case.
if
you
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
the
decision
is
based
on
jurisdiction,
it's
not
based
on
intent
of
the
parties.
volt
is
all
about
the
intent
of
the
parties
that
you
imply
from
a
choice
of
law
clause.
and
if
the
intent
of
the
parties
is
so
clearly
expressed
that
we're
going
to
arbitrate
a
particular
issue,
i
don't
think
you
even
get
to
an
implied
intention.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
i
that
that
volt
should
be
rejected.
but
in
the
alternative,
i
think
under
first
options
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
arbitrator.
if
they
want
to
make
an
argument
that
we
didn't
intend
to
arbitrate
arbitrability,
even
though
california
law
is
per
se
on
that
point
in
our
favor,
then
you
have
the
option
of
remanding
that
question
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
well,
i
think
lawyers
do
it
reflexively
because
out
of
fear
that
somehow
the
law
in
some
other
state
that
they
don't
know
is
going
to
wind
up
being
the
conflict
of
law--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--of
course
not.
i
mean,
if
one
incorporates
california
law,
one
doesn't
incorporate
pre
empted
california
law.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
absolutely.
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
all
about
effectuating
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
expeditiously
and
privately
decide
the
issue.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
certainly.
to
that
i
would
add
the
observation
that
under
volt,
since
there
were
parties
that
were
not
bound
by
arbitration,
you
are
going
to
have
all
the
expense
of
the
other
lawsuits,
anyway.
so,
you
have
in
terms
of
the
efficiency
of
the
proceeding,
in
volt
you
were
going
to
have
a
multiplication
of
litigation
no
matter
what
you
did.
here
that's
not
true.
the
only
reason
we
had
a
multiplication
of
litigation
is
because
judge
ferrer
filed
a
labor
commissioner
petition
and
then
a
superior
court
lawsuit.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
i
don't
know
the
labor
commissioner
has
ever
attempted
that.
i
wouldn't
be
concerned
about
it.
i
know--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--well,
that
is
what
1700.45
says
for
talent
agents.
in
20
years
i've
never
heard
of
the
labor
commissioner
doing
that.
but
i
can't
imagine
anyone
is
going
to
be
awfully
concerned
about
it.
i
certainly
wouldn't
be.
if
the
labor
commissioner
wanted
to
attend,
they
would
be
welcome.
i
don't
think
that's
based
on
a
legal
right
because
my
client's
a
personal
manager
and
isn't
regulated
by
the
talent
agency--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--i'm
not
sure...
i
certainly...
personally,
in
this
case
no
problem
with
that.
i
don't
think
that's
how
it
works.
the
statute
simply
requires
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
attend;
and
there's
no
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
labor
commissioner
was
deprived
of
that,
because
we
never
got
to
that
point.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
it's
a
little
bit
complicated.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
i
have
an
answer
for
you.
the
labor
commissioner
is
considered
a
peace
officer
under
california
law.
they
actually
have
the
power
to
arrest.
at
one
point
many
years
ago,
there
was
an
arrest
of
a
manager
for
soliciting
and
procuring.
he
got
jane
wyman
a
job
on
a
tv
show
called
"falcon
crest",
and
there
was
an
arrest
and
there
was
a
criminal
statute
at
that
time.
and
the
legislature
responded
to
this
incident
by
repealing
the
criminal
statute.
so
the
only
action
the
legislature
has
had
since
deregulating
the
managers
and
taking
them
out
of
the
statute
entirely
was
removing
the
criminal
enforcement
power.
in
terms
of
the
labor
commissioner's
civil
enforcement
powers,
there
are
statutes.
the
first
hundred
sections
in
the
labor
code
do
give
the
labor
commissioner
certain
intervention
powers.
but,
reading
those
statutes,
they
would
seem
to
apply
in
wage
cases
and
confiscation
of
tools,
that
sort
of
thing.
they
don't
really
mention...
now
would
the
labor
commissioner...
if
the
labor
commissioner
wanted
to
intervene,
i
think
that
if
you
take
the
penumbra
of
all
these
statutes
probably
the
labor
commissioner
could.
i
think,
even
though
there's
not
in
my
20
years
handling
these
cases
been
a
situation
where
the
labor
commissioner
filed
any
kind
of
a
civil
proceeding,
everybody
assumes
the
labor
commissioner
could
seek
an
injunction
if
they
wanted
to.
it
just
doesn't
occur
because
they're
busy
doing
things
like
collecting
wages.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
well,
in
a
sense,
under
the
gun
of
the
injunction
hearing
the
next
day,
that's
what
the
arbitrator
did.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
i
would
certainly
protest,
but
the
arbitrator
undoubtedly
has
the
power
to
wait
for
the
labor
commissioner
to
render
an
advisory
decision.
in
a
sense
that's
what
the
arbitrator
did.
in
a
moment
of
i
think
irrational
exuberance
he
talked
about
the
expertise
of
the
labor
commissioner.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
yes.
mr.
bosch
has
32
years
as
an
entertainment
lawyer.
he
knows
the
talent
agency
act
considerable
better
than
any
of
the
civil
service
lawyers
at
the
labor
commissioner.
that's
why
i
referred
to
it
as
irrational
exuberance,
because
the
labor
commissioner...
some
of
them
get
pretty
good
and
then
they
move
on
to
other
jobs,
and
you
wind
up
with
people
who
hear
wage
claims.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
enforcing
the
labor
commissioner's
decision?
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
well,
that
is
what
judge
ferrer
asked
the
superior
court
to
do,
was
first
send
this
to
the
labor
commissioner.
then
specifically
the
complaint
by
judge
ferrer
sought
declaratory
relief,
that
the
arbitration
is
void,
the
guy
is
an
illegal
talent
agent,
so
he
should
never
be
allowed
to
arbitrate.
that
was
the
declaratory
relief
that
was
sought.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
well,
absent...
our
position
is
that
that's
preemptive,
of
course.
absent
the
arbitration
agreement,
it
would
be
the
superior
court
that
would
decide
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
if
the
respondent
prevails
in
the
labor
commissioner?
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
the
position
i've
taken
from
the
beginning,
including
in
my
briefs
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
yes,
that
if
the
decision
is
correct,
if
this
court
affirms
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
de
novo
would
go
to
the
superior
court.
now,
it
is
a
true
de
novo;
in
other
words,
it's
not
deferential
to
the
labor
commissioner.
it's
simply
a
complete
rehearing
from
scratch
of
the
whole
case.
but
it
has
always
been
my
position
and
it
was
until
we
got
to
this
court
the
respondent's
position
that
the
de
novo
would
go
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
well,
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
california
arbitration--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--well--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--well,
i
think
in
section
3
would...
there
should
be
a
stay
of
the
judicial
proceedings
so
that
the
arbitration
can
proceed.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
yes,
justice
scalia.
the
obligation
comes
from
the
contract.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
i
think
that's
doubly
so
if
you
incorporate
the
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association,
which
provides
you
with
the
maximum
breadth.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
i
think
it's
a
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing.
if
you
agree
to
do
it
you
should
do
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
i
think
there
are
a
couple--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--i
think
this
entire
area
of
jurisprudence
involves
pre
dispute
arbitration
agreements
and
then
some
party
decides
it's
not
to
my
advantage
and
they
run
to
court.
that's
almost
every
case.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
at...
at
the
time
we
were
in
the
superior
court,
buckeye
had
not
yet
been
decided.
we
were...
in
december
of
2005
was
the
injunction
hearing,
and
buckeye
i
believe
was
published
in
february
of
2006.
i
relied
on
the
california
case,
the
erickson
case,
which
made
prima
paint
the
law
of
california,
and
it
wasn't
persuasive.
then
buckeye
was
handed
down
while
we
were
on
appeal.
but
i
certainly,
when
i
read
buckeye,
i
said
that's
my
price,
because
prima
paint
was
about
fraud
in
the
inducement.
we
were
in
a
situation
where
we
were
dealing
with
an
attack
on
the
legality
of
the
entire
contract
and
i
read
buckeye
and
said,
that's
my
case.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
disagree
that
there
wasn't
an
evidentiary
hearing.
i
don't
think
the
evidence
is
considered,
but
in
addition
to
mr.
preston's
declaration,
i
made
an
offer
of
proof
which
is
in
the
appellant's
appendix
at
page
219.
i
offered
to
prove
that
the
judge
alex
television
program
is
solicited
and
procured
by
an
agent
of
the
william
morris
agency.
i
had
made
two
attempts
to
depose
judge
ferrer
to
prove
that,
and
i
never
got
the
chance.
he
didn't
want
to
be
deposed.
so,
there
was
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
the
evidence
just
wasn't
considered
because
the
legal
standard
that
was
applied
was
there's
a
colorable
claim
under
the
talent
agencies
act,
so
you
can't
arbitrate
until
it's
resolved.
now
i
saw
this
as
being
a
long
trek
through
the
courts.
i
don't
know
when
the
arbitrator
gets
to
make
his
decision.
if...
if
the
labor
commissioner
rules
that
the
contract
is
void
and
then
we
have
a
de
novo
and
the
superior
court
does
that,
and
the
court
of
appeal
does
it,
and
then
the
california
supreme
court
rules
the
contract
is
void,
does
the
arbitrator
get
to
overrule
that.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
i
certainly
think
that
the
arbitrator
had
jurisdiction
to
arbitrate
arbitrability.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
qualcomm
case
and
the
dream
theater
case
is
a
california
case
cited
in
qualcomm,
and
that
the
arbitrator
should
have
decided
all
these
issues.
i
would
make
this
observation.
if
we...
if
we
had
gone
to
the
arbitrator
and
judge
ferrer
had
said
look,
this
contract
is
illegal,
said
you
don't
have
jurisdiction,
and
i
want
you
to
rule
you
don't
have
jurisdiction,
the
same
illegality
issue
would
be
a
defense
on
the
merits.

assuming
volt--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--because
in
volt
the
contract
was
silent,
and
the
federal
arbitration
act
was
silent
on
the
issue
that
was
presented,
and
state
law
supplied
the
answer.
the
california
arbitration
act
has
a
number
of--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--the
contract
here,
i
would
submit,
justice
kennedy,
is
not
quiet
because
it
says
that
validity
or
legality
shall
be
arbitrated.
and
that's
what
we
are
talking
about.
so
you
don't
have
a
silent
contract.
you
have
a
contract
that
speaks
to
that
question.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
volt
was
written
under
the
california
arbitration
act,
and
speaking
as
a
california
practitioner
that
had
had
a
lot
of
cases,
you
might
notice
that
the
same
section
in
volt
was
the
basis
for
my
motion
to
compel
arbitration.
see
codicil
procedure
cc
p
1281.2.
cc
p
1281
is
almost
identical
to
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
but
the
california
arbitration
act
has
a
number
of
provisions
where
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
silent.
one
of
those
is
dealing
with
multi
party
litigation
where
parties
are
not
bound.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
i
think
it
would
have
come
out
the
other
way,
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
that's
what
volt
was
all
about,
was
the
fact
that--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--i
think
the
labor
commissioner
probably
does.
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
adjudicatory
versus
prosecutorial
function
of
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
no.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
this
is...
this
is
an...
this
is
an
administrative
agency
providing
an
adjudicatory
forum.
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
waffle
house
was
all
about
the
prosecutorial
or
administrative
power.
this
is
about
the
adjudicatory--
mr.
joseph
d.
schleimer
--i
think
i
pointed
out
in
my
papers
that
nothing
stops
judge
ferrer
from
putting
a
dime
in
the
phone,
calling
the
labor
commissioner
and
complaining,
saying
there's
been
illegality
here.
they
may
request
some
evidence
at
that
point.
but
the
point
is
that
the
prosecutorial
discretion
will
be
exercised
by
the
labor
commissioner
acting
in
an
essentially
executive
branch
function.
here
in
our
case,
all
they
did
was
supply
a
hearing
room
and
a
hearing
officer,
an
adjudicatory
function.
that's
what
the
arbitrator
is
supposed
to
do,
is
adjudicate
the
case.
that's
the
distinction.
and
i
see
gilmer
as
being
a
situation
where
there's
an
attempt
to
avoid
adjudicating
in
the
agreed
forum.
and
i
see
waffle
house
as
saying
that
we're
not
going
to
hogtie
administrative
agencies
when
they
perform
the
prosecutorial
function,
the
administrative
function.
i
guess
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
