what
do
you...
what
do
you
make,
in
answering
justice
scalia's
question,
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
this
contract
included,
i
guess,
a
choice
of
law
provision
to
the
effect
that
california
law
applies,
and
if
california
law
comes
in
so
does
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
commissioner?
so
that
in
effect
you
have
implicitly
agreed
to
take
the
labor
commissioner
as
well
as
agreeing
to
arbitrate,
and
the
argument
is
the
labor
commissioner
comes
first.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
that
the
question
of
implicit
option
of
california
law
is
at
issue
in
the
case
as
it
gets
to
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be
great
as
a
means
of
informing
the
labor
commissioner,
but
it
virtually
destroys
the
value
of
arbitration--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
the
expeditiousness
of
arbitration
is
gone
once
you
start
down
the
california
procedural
road.
they
don't
want
to
go
to
arbitration
8
to
12
months
later.
they
want
it
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
they
probably
shouldn't
have
agreed
to
arbitrate,
but
they
did
agree
to
arbitrate,
and
they
want
to
arbitrate
now.
and
one
of
the
points
of
arbitration
is
to
get
the
ball
rolling
fast,
and
that
cannot
be
done
under
the
system
you
are
arguing
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
make
that
argument
below,
that
implicitly
they
have
imported
the
california
labor
scheme
in
as
a...
in
effect,
as
a
condition
precedent
to
the
arbitration?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
didn't
go
further
than
to
cite
that
case.
is
that
correct?
