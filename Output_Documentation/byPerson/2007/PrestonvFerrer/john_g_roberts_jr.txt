chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-1463,
preston
v.
ferrer.
mr.
schleimer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
wouldn't
eliminate
it.
your
friend
on
the
other
side
says
it
the
simply
delays
it,
because
you
get
to
arbitrate
de
novo
after
the
commissioner's
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
i
could
let
him
answer,
but
i
suppose
he
would
say
you
go
to
that
court,
and
you
get
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
have
to
confess
i've
never
understood
these
choice
of
alaw
provisions.
you
incorporate
california
law.
i
assume
california
law
is
interpreted
consistent
with
federal
law.
if
federal
law
preempts
california
law,
that's
what
you're
incorporating.
it
always
struck
me
as
kind
of
circular.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
california
law
applies,
you
don't
mean
to
the
exclusion
of
federal
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
would
you
have
any
problem
with
a
california
law
that
said
you
can
arbitrate
but
the
arbitrator
must
allow
the
labor
commissioner
to
file
an
amicus
brief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
it
goes
on
and
says,
and
you
must
allow
the
labor
commissioner
to
appear
at
the
arbitration?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
what
if
it
says
you've
got
to
wait
for
30
days
to
allow
the
labor
commissioner
to
consider
whether
or
not
to
intervene?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
was
the
arbitrator
chosen?
does
he
or
she
have
any
particular
expertise
in
this
area?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
brunstad.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
normally
we
say
that
those
types
of
disputes
are
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
the
theory
is
that
the
arbitrator
can
apply
the
existing
law
as
well
as
a
court,
and
if
that's
the
theory,
couldn't
the
arbitrator
apply
the
existing
law
as
well
as
an
agency?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
so
you
at
least
have
that
additional
step.
it
is...
particularly
since
you
only
have
10
days
to
appeal
from
the
labor
commissioner,
someone
who
wants
to
arbitrate
has
to
appeal,
has
to
go
to
superior
court
and
get
a
motion
to
compel.
you
can't
even
wait
to
see
if
your
opponent
goes
to
superior
court
and...
well,
if
he
has
won,
he
wouldn't
go
into
court.
but
you
have
to
go
to
the
court
to
get
a
motion
to
compel?
you
can't
just
go
ahead
and
proceed
with
arbitration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
you...
and
if
you
are
successful
and
get
from
the
superior
court
an
order
to
compel
arbitration,
your
opponent
can
then
appeal
it,
i
assume.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
do
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--mr.
schleimer,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
friend
says
that
this
agency
has
exactly
that
power,
and
the
reason
you
required
these
things
to
go
before
her,
is
that
she
knows
what's
going
on
in
the
area
and,
if
appropriate,
can
take
the
supervisory
authority
or
whatever
the
equivalent
of
prosecutorial
action
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
