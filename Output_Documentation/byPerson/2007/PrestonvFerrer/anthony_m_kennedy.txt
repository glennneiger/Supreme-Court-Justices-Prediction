justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
couldn't
find
the
order
that
the
court...
in
the
record
it
says
that
the
order
would
be...
the
court
granted
a
preliminary
injunction,
the
superior
court,
and
then
it
said,
according
to
an
order
to
be
entered
by
the
clerk.
how
long
was
the
arbitration
stayed
for?
there
was
an
enjoined...
there
was
an
injunction.
what
was
the
term
of
the
injunction?
just
until
further
order
of
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
respondent
at
any
point
indicate
that
after
the
labor
commission,
labor
commissioner,
made
a
determination
that
they
would
not
go
to
superior
court
for
de
novo
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
must
say
that
the
volt
case
is
written
in
rather
sweeping
language
that's
not
particularly
helpful
to
you.
on
its
facts,
i
think
it's
different
because
there
were
other
parties,
independent
parties
in
the
litigation.
don't
you
think
that's
the
best
way
to
distinguish
volt
in
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
labor
commissioner
have
authority
to
commence
proceedings
on
his
own
motion
or
her
own
motion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
sorry
that
i
asked
already.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
go
to
the
superior
court
for
de
novo
review,
can
you
ask
the
superior
court
for
an
order
enforcing
its
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
get
de
novo
review.
so
do
you
ask
the
court
for
an
order...
a
declaratory
order,
declaring
that
the
person
is
a
talent
agent
or
is
not
a
talent
agent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
do
you
think
it
would
be
within
the
authority
of
the
superior
court
to
say
this
is
a
judgment
binding
on
the
parties
and
the
arbitration
will
not
proceed,
or
must
proceed
consistently
with
my
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
well,
but
if
the
respondent
prevails,
don't
you
think
that
the
superior
court
has
that
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
respondent
prevails
in
this
case,
don't
you
think
that
the
superior
court
can
then
say
that
its
declaration
is
final
and
the
arbitration
shall
not
proceed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
take
that
position
below,
was
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
arbitrator
already
agreed
to
do
that.
you
didn't
need
the
injunction
for
that
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
but
if
your
position
is
that
we
have
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
state
system,
the
labor
expert
and
so
forth
and
the
state
builds
in
to
that
procedure,
de
novo
review
superior
court,
it
seems
to
me
rather
difficult
for
you
to
now
just
say
oh,
well,
the
superior
court
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
understand
your
position.
in
this
case,
does
the
california
provision
for
de
novo
review
in
the
superior
court
apply
to
stay
the
arbitration
while
that
aspect
of
the
proceeding
is
completed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
was:
you
go
to
the
labor
commissioner.
you
also
have
a
de
novo
right
to
go
to
the
superior
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
labor
commissioner
said
something
absolutely
silly.
wouldn't
you
think
you
would
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
superior
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
would
make
no
sense
to
do
that
and...
and
not
to
also
stay
the
arbitration.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
now,
we
have
this
case.
we
have
an
arbitration
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
arbitrator
is
waiting.
you
go
to
the
labor
commissioner,
you
go
to
the
superior
court
to
say
enjoin
the
arbitration
while
i
go
to
the
labor
commissioner.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
labor
commissioner
does
something
silly.
can
you
not
then
go
to
superior
court
and
get
de
novo
review
of
that
wrong
decision
of
the
labor
commissioner
before
the
arbitration
starts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
you
taken
that
position
consistently
in
this
litigation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
taken
no
position
on
it
either
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
telling
us
that
under
no
circumstance,
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
would
you
go
to
the
superior
court
for
de
novo
review
and...
and,
as
part
of
that,
stay
the
arbitration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
let's
assume
the
arbitration
clause
is
valid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
in
this
case
you
have
assumed
that
that
arbitration
has
to
be
stayed
for
the
labor
commissioner.
so
the
case
does
not
have
to
be
stayed,
and
you
would
not
ask
for
it
to
be
stayed,
in
the
superior
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
said
the
fact
that
the
losing
party
will
have
a
right
to
de
novo
hearing,
involving
additional
time
and
money,
does
not
excuse
the
defendant
from
the
legal
requirement
to
exhaust
his
remedy.
and
i
think
you're
preserving
the
option
to
go
to
the
superior
court,
at
least
the
contestability
of
the
arbitration
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that,
it
seems
to
me,
makes
incorrect
your
statement
in
your
brief
that,
oh,
this
is
just
for
eight
months,
so
that
there's
very
little
additional
time
involved
because
of
the
de
novo
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
you
think
that
your
statement
at
page
34
of
the
brief
has
to
be
qualified
in
that
respect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
also
have
the
right
to
challenge
what...
the
accuracy
of
the
labor
department's
finding.
that's
what
both...
all
the
judges
on
the
california
court
agreed
with
that.
so
i'm
asking,
doesn't
that
make...
require
qualification
of
your
statement
at
page
34
that
these
procedures
are
expeditious
and
informal
and
do
not
entail
additional
expense
or
delay?
all
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
does
require
some
qualification
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
does
it
also
require
some
qualification
in
you
brief
where,
at
page
12,
you
say
preston
clearly
and
repeatedly
sought
to
procure
employment
for
ferrer
in
the
television
industry?
our
rules
say
that
you
cannot
raise
matters
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
and
you
have
no
evidence
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
you
didn't,
and
that's
why
i'm
questioning
why
you
put
it
in
your
brief.
doesn't
that
require
some
qualification?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
therefore,
don't
make
factual
averments
here
for
the
first
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think,
in
the
briefs
to
this
court,
you
can
make
factual
statements
that
are
not
in
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
they
do
say
that
it
is
disputed.
they
do
dispute
that
he
clearly
and
repeatedly
sought
to
procure
employment
for
ferrer.
that's
the
whole
issue
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
said
it
is...
they
dispute
that
it
is
to
procure
employment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
to
me
completely
inconsistent
with
your
argument
that
additional
time
is
minimal.
and
if
you
have
repeated
statements
in
your
brief
that
require
qualifications,
if
in
your
former
argument
in
marshal,
the
court
is
concerned
with
the
accuracy
of
one
of
your
citations,
shouldn't
we
view
with
some
skepticism
what
you
tell
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
always
the
case.
it's
always
the
case
that
the
arbitration
is
quiet
on
this.
it
is...
the
respondent's
position
is
that
it
is
absolutely
quiet,
but
it
is
also
absolutely
clear
that
it
is
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
volt
would
have
been
different.
volt
is...
volt
is
written
very
broadly,
it
seems
to
me,
in
favor
of
the
respondent's
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
if
we
write
the
case
your
way,
we
have
to
talk
about
what
happens
if
this
labor
commissioner
had
enforcement
powers,
that
they
had
the
sua
sponte
right
to
invoke,
and
that
they
did?
