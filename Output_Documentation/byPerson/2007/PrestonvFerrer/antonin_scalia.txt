justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
thought
you
would...
you
would
say
that
when
you
have
a
contract
which
says
that
any
disputes
under
this
shall
be
arbitrated
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
the
aaa
or
whatever,
that
that
does
automatically
exclude
a
parallel
proceeding.
otherwise,
provisions
like
that
make
no
sense
at
all;
they
achieve
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
nor
do
you
mean
that
california
applies
even
when
it
contradicts
the
express
provisions
of
your
agreement?
i
mean,
the
specific
governs
of
the
general?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
positive
federal
law.
what
stops
him
from
doing
it
is
the
contractual
agreement,
isn't
it,
between
the
parties?
the
faa
just
says
that
the
state
will
not
set
aside
that
contractual
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
we
say
we'll
arbitrate
all
disputes
under
this
contract,
it
means
we'll
arbitrate
all
disputes
under
this
contract;
neither
one
of
us
will
go
to
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
used
to
teach
contract
law,
and
i
am
sure
that
when
you
say
you'll
arbitrate,
it
means
you
won't
litigate.
and
even
if
i
didn't
ever
teach
contract
law,
it
would
still
be
the
law.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
take
a
position
below?
your
friend
says
that
this
is
brand
new
up
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
you
want
this
to
happen?
why...
who
would
imagine
such
a
system
in
which
you
bring
it
to
the
labor
commissioner
and
you
prevent
the
matter
from
being
resolved
immediately
with
an
arbitrator.
i
don't
know
how
long
does
it
take
for
the
labor
commissioner?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
eight
months.
but
then
when
he's
done--
justice
antonin
scalia
--she.
no
matter
what
happens,
you
go
back
to
the
arbitrator.
who
in
his
right
mind
would
set
up
such
a
system?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
person
is
not
a
talent
agent.
justice
antonin
scalia
judgment
involved
would
have
been
binding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
third
parties.
you
don't...
and
you
assert
that
the
judgment
here
wouldn't
be
binding
at
all.
it's
just
because
the
labor
commissioner,
he
or
she,
is
such
an
expert
on
this...
your
opponent
says
she's
not
at
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
imagine
that's
highly
debatable.
it's
a
different
case
where
you
say
you
have
to
wait
for
a
court
decision
which
will
be
conclusive
as
to
many
of
the
people
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
his
hypothetical
was
that
the
court
decision
would
just
be
advisory
and
the
arbitrator
could
ignore
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
get,
you
know,
a
knowledgeable
person's
input.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
contract
said
the
same
thing.
this
contract
will
be
governed
by
california
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
suck
up
this
provision
that
says
you
have
to
go
to
the
superior
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
don't
think
so
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
say...
i
thought
you
said
it
doesn't
become
binding.
that
it
is
just
advice
to
the
arbitrator.
once
you...
once
you
get
the
remand
to
the
arbitrator,
it
is
not
binding.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
don't
understand...
so
you
incorporate
california
law.
i
interpret
that
to
mean
substantive
law
of
california.
you
say
also
incorporates...
and
this
is
what
i
find
peculiar.
california
law
gives
you
a
procedural
right
to
go
to
the
labor
commission.
but
it
also
gives
you
a
procedural
right
to
go
to
superior
court.
and,
yet,
you
acknowledge
that
the
arbitration
agreement,
when
you
say
we
will
arbitrate,
forecloses
your
using
the
superior
court.
why
doesn't
it
foreclose
your
using
the
labor
commissioner?
i
don't
understand
how
you
slice
the
bologna
that
thin.
to
me,
if
it
excludes
california
procedures,
it
excludes
both
the
labor
commissioner
and
the
superior
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me...
i
want
to
understand
that
answer.
california
law
includes
the
superior
court
as
much
as
it
includes
the
labor
commissioner.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
california
supreme
court
would
construct
a
system
in
which
you
get
the
advice
of
this
expert,
the
labor
commissioner.
one
of
the
parties
thinks
that
this
expert's
advice
is
ridiculous,
just
absolutely
wrong.
now,
california
law
generally
considers
the
superior
court
smarter
than
the
labor
commissioner,
which
is
why
you
get
de
novo
review
before
the
superior
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
stupider
than
the
labor
commissioner.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
i
will
amend
it.
the
california
superior
court
is
ex
officio
smarter
than
the
labor
commissioner,
okay?
and
yet,
one
of
the
parties
who
thinks
the
labor
commissioner
is
dead
wrong
doesn't
get
a
chance
to
have
this
advice
corrected
the
way
the
california
constitution
envisions,
by
the
ex
officio
smarter
superior
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
the
scheme
that
the
california
supreme
court
is
going
to
embed
in
california
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
latter
is
disputed.
the
latter
is
vigorously
disputed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
volt
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
if...
if
in
fact,
all
of
the
parties
in
this
other
litigation
had
agreed
to
arbitration?
you
have
any
doubt--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah.
i
do,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
writing
broadly
is
known
as
dictum,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
