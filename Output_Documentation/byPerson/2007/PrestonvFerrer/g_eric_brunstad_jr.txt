mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
california
talent
agencies
act
does
not
invalidate
the
arbitration
agreement
between
mr.
preston
and
judge
ferrer.
at
most,
it
merely
postpones
arbitration--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--the
labor
commissioner--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
think
to
answer
your
question,
justice
breyer,
it's
helpful
just
to
delineate
the
procedure
of
how
it's
supposed
to
work.
you're
supposed
to
go
to
the
california
labor
commissioner
first
if
there's
any
controversy
arising
under
the
california
talent
agencies
act.
that
is
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
concept
that
the
california
supreme
court
articulated
in
styne
v
stevens.
after
the
california
talent
agencies
act
has
been
administered
by
the
labor
commissioner,
either
party
has
as
of
right
the
ability
to
take
an
appeal
to
the
california
superior
court,
at
which
point
all
of
the
california
arbitration
rules
apply,
and
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration
could
be
made
at
that
point
and
arbitration
could
happen.
and
now
it's
a
de
novo
hearing
from
the
labor
commissioner's
proceeding,
which
means
under
california
law,
the
waisbren
case
and
the
buchwald
case,
that
it's
as
though
the
labor
commissioner
proceeding
had
not
happened
at
all.
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it's
not
brand
new,
justice
scalia.
we
never
got
that
far.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
never
took
that
position
below
because
we
never
got
that
far,
justice
kennedy.
we
only
got
to
the
point
whether
we
should
have
a
preliminary
injunction
so
that
the
labor
commissioner
could
go
first.
once
the
labor
commissioner--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
the
motion
for
the
injunction
was
filed
because
the
arbitrator
initially
denied
a
stay
of
arbitration.
the
arbitrator
himself
then
reconsidered
his
ruling
a
day
before
the
hearing
on
the
injunction,
and
the
arbitrator
said
i'd
like
to
hear
from
the
labor
commissioner
because
the
labor
commissioner
is
expert.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
it
is
important...
this
goes
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
why
is
it
a
de
novo
proceeding?
well,
in
the
sinnamon
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
there
are
constitutional
reasons
under
the
california's
constitution.
the
labor
commissioner
doesn't
exercise
any
judicial
authority
and
does
not
have
the
power
to
finally
decide
this
controversy.
the
labor
commissioner
is
merely
exercising
her
administrative
power
over
this
dispute
because
this
is
part
of
a
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
on
average
8
months,
justice
scalia.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
she,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
there
are
valid
reasons.
there
are
very
compelling
reasons
why
california
set
up
this
system.
california
law
says
if
you're
going
to
act
like
a
talent
agent,
you're
going
to
procure
employment...
that's
the
touchstone...
you're
acting
as
a
talent
agency,
you're
supposed
to
submit
your
contracts
in
advance
for
pre
approval
from
the
labor
commissioner.
you're
supposed
to
bring
your
disputes
there.
that's
how
the
labor
commissioner
learns
of
disputes.
the
labor
commissioner
is
supposed
to
develop
this
body
of
law
by
interpreting
it.
all--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--the
is
person
is
a
talent
agent,
justice
scalia.
he
was
operating
to
procure
employment.
and
the
statute
says
anyone
who
even
attempts
to
procure
employment
is
a
talent
agent,
and
that
is
all
that
mr.
preston
did.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
chief
justice
roberts,
there
are
other
things
that
the
labor
commissioner
is
invested
with
jurisdiction
to
do.
the
labor
commissioner
has
to
find
out
about
these
disputes.
how
does
she
find
out?
because
parties
bring
these
petitions.
this
is
a
great
deterrent
for
people
from
violating
the
california
talent
agencies
act.
it
works
because
the
dispute
has
to
come
before
her.
she
knows
who
the
bad
apples
are.
she
knows
she
can
go
to
get
injunctive
relief
if
she
needs
to.
her
expertise
is
advanced.
she
gets
to
decide
the
controversy
initially.
and
it
merely
postpones
arbitration.
and
critically,
this
is--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
but
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
justice
souter,
it's
actually
enhanced.
it's
enhanced
for
all
the
reasons
that,
when
exert
brings
his
or
her
expertise
to
bear,
you
can
get
a
settlement;
you
get
expedited
resolution
the
issues
get
refined.
most
parties
don't
go
to
arbitration
after
this
because--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but,
justice
souter,
this
is
what
they
bargained
for.
they
bargained
for
the
application
of
california
law
under
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
souter,
we
cited
the
volt
case
before
the
california
court
of
appeal.
now,
the
other
side
did
not
raise--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but,
justice
breyer,
they
did
not
raise
the
pre
emption
argument
at
all.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
did
by
responding
to
their
argument.
we
did
cite
volt.
the
only
other--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--we
did
not
go
further
than
to
cite
volt,
but
let
me--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because
volt
simply
was
about...
a
case
about
postponing
arbitration
in
favor
of
litigation
going
forward,
which
has
actually
had
a
greater
impact--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--true,
but--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--except
the
labor
commissioner
herself
who
is
supposed
to
do
these
administrative
procedures
for
all
kinds
of
validate
and
compelling
state
court...
state
law
reasons.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
she
is,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but,
justice
scalia,
in
volt,
the
state
court
litigation
went
forward,
the
related
litigation.
it
could
have
res
judicata/collateral
estoppel
effects
on
the
arbitration.
it
has
even
more
of
an
impact
on
arbitration--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--true,
justice
ginsburg,
but
at
least
it
can
bind
one
of
the
parties
and
therefore
tie
the
hands
of
the
arbitrator
in
the
subsequent
proceeding.
here
this
is
not
possible.
the
parties
bargained
for
this
in
their
agreement
when
they
bargained
for
the
application
of
california
law.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
if
that's
what
parties
bargained
for,
that
was
their
agreement.
it
would
be--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
i
understand
your
hypothetical--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because
here
what
the
labor
commissioner
does
is
not
what
a
court
does.
"labor
commissioner"
is
not
synonymous
with
"the
court"
and
cannot
be
under
california's
constitution.
here
you
have
a
complete,
again,
arbitration
postponing
rule
and
nothing
more.
the
arbitrator's
hands
are
not
tied
in
any
way;
whereas
the
arbitrator's
hands
would
be
tied
if
in
fact
you
had
court
litigation
that
was
conclusive
between
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
that
would
be--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but,
justice
scalia,
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
arbitration
clause
itself.
here,
however,
it
is
not.
here
the
parties
bargained
for
the
application
of
california
law.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
right.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
here
it
would,
yes,
because
california
law
requires
you
to
go
to
the
labor
commissioner
first,
not
to--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--under
california
law...
it
is
california
law...
you
must
go
to
the
labor
commissioner
first
before
you
go
either
to
court
or
the
arbitrator.
you
must
go
to
the
arbitrator
second.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
either
side...
either
side
can
go
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
problem
i'm
having
with
your
question
is
that
i
think
you
are
assuming
that
there's
an
arbitration
in
place
while
the
labor
commissioner
is
going
forward.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
do.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
kennedy,
because
once--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--we
never
got
there,
justice
kennedy.
we
never
got
to
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--we
took
the
position
that
the
superior
court
should
stay
the
arbitration
because
you
have
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies
first;
and,
consistent
with
the
federal
arbitration
act,
section
2,
there
might
be
grounds
for
invalidating
this
arbitration
act.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
specifically,
justice
alito,
no.
what
the
california
courts
have
decided
is
that
there
is
a
de
novo
right,
and--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes.
but
the
california
supreme
court
has
also
said,
in
construing
its
own
arbitration
act,
which
is
section
1281,
which
is
basically
the
same
as
section
2
of
the
faa...
said,
look,
when
we
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
if
you
have
an
arbitration
proceeding,
the...
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration
must
be
granted
unless,
for
example,
the
arbitration
clause
is
invalid
for
some
reason.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
the
parties
could
voluntarily
do
that.
but,
yes,
if
you
don't
do
the
de
novo
proceeding,
then
the
labor
commissioner's
decision
becomes
binding.
so
you
must
take
the
step
of
doing
the
notice
of
appeal
and
then
do
a
motion
to
compel.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
scalia.
if
i
made
that
impression,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
mistaken.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if...
if...
you
have
a
right
to
take
an
appeal
to
the
california
superior
court.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
once
you
get
to
the
california
superior
court,
then,
under
section
1281,
you
have
a
right
to
move
to
compel
for
arbitration,
just
as
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
if
do
you
not
do
those
things,
if
you
do
not
take
the
appeal,
then
the
labor
commissioner's...
by
default,
her
ruling
becomes
binding.
so
you
have
to
do
the
appellate
process,
and
you
must
file
a
motion.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
your
opponent
can
appeal
the
decision
compelling
the
arbitration
if
it
were
improperly
granted,
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
if
the
arbitration
clause
is
valid
and
applicable,
we
will
go
to
arbitration.
that
validity
and
applicability
has
not
been
tested
by
any
court
below.
for
example,
are
there
grounds--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
we
will
go
to
arbitration.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
labor
commissioner
goes
first.
then,
we
go
to
arbitration.
if
this
court
rules
that
the
labor
commissioner's
jurisdiction
is
preempted,
then
we
go
back
to
the...
to
the
lower
court.
if
the
arbitration
clause
is
valid
and
applicable,
we
will
go
to
arbitration.
that
is
correct.
chief
justice
roberts,
you
asked
a
question
about
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--under
first
options
here,
were
it
not
unmistakably
clear
that
the
parties
said
that
the
arbitrator
should
decide
arbitrability,
that
would
be
for
the
court
to
decide.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
what
i
meant
in
that
language,
justice
ginsburg,
is
simply
this:
for
example,
if
the
arbitration
clause
were
invalid
because
the
arbitration
clause,
itself,
were,
say,
fraudulent
or...
for
something,
then
it
would
not
be
validate
and
applicable;
or
if
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause
were
limited
in
some
way,
then
the
scope
issue,
the
arbitrability
issue,
is
for
the
court
to
decide
as
this
court
decided
in
first
options.
here
we
do
not
have
the
unmistakably
clear
language
that
the
parties
intended
that
the
question
of
arbitrability,
itself,
to
be
to
the
arbitrator.
so
the
court
would
decide
if,
in
fact,
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
correct.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
and
this
goes
to
the
chief
justice's
initial
question
which
i
have
been
trying
to
get
to.
and
that
is
when
the
parties
incorporated
california
law,
what
did
they
incorporate?
well,
in
volt
this
court
answered:
when
they
incorporated
california
law,
it
was
california
law;
not
california
law
with
a
gloss
of
federal
law,
but
california
law.
and
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
chronus
case
that
we
cite
says
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
because
that
goes...
because
i
think
that
this
court
held
that
it
to
be
no
in
volt.
it
said,
look,
where
the...
because
that
goes
to
the
applicability,
the
validity,
of
the
arbitration
clause,
itself.
here
we
don't
have
arbitrability,
itself.
the
first
options
standard
is
not
satisfied
under
this
case.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
two
reasons,
justice
scalia:
first,
in
the
buckeye
case,
for
example,
the
parties
specifically
selected
as
their
choice
of
law
the
federal
arbitration
act.
here
the
parties
selected
california
law.
this
is
no
different
than
in
volt.
the
second
reason,
justice
scalia--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--in
volt,
your
honor,
the
specific
law
that
was...
the
court
said
was
selected
was
section
1281
of
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure,
which
applies
in
a
california
court
favoring
a
court
proceeding
because
california
has
this
rule
that
says
if
you
have
arbitration
and
related
litigation,
you
can
stay--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
but
here
i
think
the
court
has
drawn
the
proper
distinction
between,
on
the
one
hand,
volt
and,
on
the
other
hand,
doctor's
associates,
mastrobuono,
perry,
allied-bruce,
all
of
those
cases
where
the
court
has
said
if
it
is
an
arbitration
negating
rule,
you
don't
incorporate
it,
because
that's
fundamentally
at
war
with
the
decision
to
arbitrate.
but
where
it's
merely
an
arbitration
postponing
rule,
which
was
the
procedural
issue
in
volt
and
the
procedural
issue
here,
then
we
respect
that
and
say
that's
not
pre
empted,
because
it's
not
necessary
to
pre
empt.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
is
inconceivable,
justice
alito,
that
the
california
court
would
say
that
arbitration
is
not
permissible
in
this
case.
the
california
supreme
court
has
reconciled
previously
in
the
aguilar
case,
which
is
32
cal.
4th
974.
you
had
two
different
provisions
of
law.
one
said
you
had
nonbinding
arbitration
for
fee
disputes
between
attorneys,
and
the
second
was
the
california
arbitration
act.
and
the
california
supreme
court
said,
as
this
court
said,
that
it
will
indulge
every
intent
to
give
effect
to
such
proceedings,
the
arbitration
proceedings,
in
section
1281.
it
will
harmonize
the
statutes
and
say
if
you
if
you
have
a
right
to
arbitrate,
we
will
respect
that
and
we
will
harmonize
the
laws
so
we
respect
that.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
scalia.
it
is
the
california
constitutional
provision.
under
california's
constitution,
for
better
or
worse,
you
cannot
have
the
labor
commissioner--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
scalia--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
bankruptcy
courts
cannot
enter
final
decisions,
yet
we
know
that
they're
expert
in
bankruptcy
law,
even
though
they're
subject
to
de
novo
review
in
the
district
court.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
but
that's
the
case
in
every
federal
arbitration
act
case,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
if
we
get
to
the
superior
court...
the
labor
commissioner
does
her
work,
and
if
the
parties
are
not
satisfied
with
it,
either
of
them
has
the
right
to
go
to
the
superior
court
for
a
de
novo
hearing
and
file
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration.
this
would
be
no
different
than
any
other
arbitration
act
case
where,
when
you
get
to
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
yes.
that
is--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
that
is...
that
is
factually
accurate.
that
is
a
factually
accurate
addition
to
what
we
said
in
our
brief.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
we
never
got
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
is
not
in
the
record,
justice
kennedy,
because
there
is
no
factual
record
in
this
case--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it's
not
for
the
first
time,
justice
kennedy.
it
was
made
all
the
way
through
the
proceedings
below.
we
never
got
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
this
case
is
still
at
the
preliminary
stages.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
that
would
mean
we
could
make
no
factual
statements
to
give
the
court
any
background
at
all.
i
think
it
is
undisputed;
it
isn't
challenged
by
the
other
side.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it's
undisputed,
that
mr.
preston
went
and
arranged
the
meeting
with
judge
ferrer
initially
with
the
folks
at
abc.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
i
will
concede
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
evidence,
so
that
qualification...
i
will
accept
that
qualification--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it
is
undisputed,
justice
ginsburg,
that
mr.
preston
never
had
a
license.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
our
argument,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
he
was
unlicensed
but
he
was
operating
as
a
talent
agent
under
section...
under
the
california
talent
agencies
act.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
is
disputed,
justice
scalia.
and
they
have
disputed
that.
but
it
is...
let
me
qualify
that
then,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
undisputed
that
he
never
had
a
license.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
ruled
against
us?
we
would
have
filed
an
appeal
to
the--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--to
the
court,
correct.
and
then
there
would
have
been
a
motion
to
compel
for
arbitration.
that--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--no,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that
all
of
our
citations
to
the
record
and
all
of
our
statements
about
the
facts
are,
in
fact,
true.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
forgive
me,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
undisputed
that
mr.
preston
never
had
a
license.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
it
is
disputed
whether
he
was
acting
as
a
talent
agent
or
not.
i
wish
to
clarify
that.
