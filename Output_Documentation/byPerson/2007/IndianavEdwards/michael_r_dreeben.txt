mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
instances
in
the
trial
courts,
particularly
with
respect
to
mentally
ill
defendants,
where
a
defendant
may
have
the
degree
of
rational
understanding
to
satisfy
the
relatively
low
standard
of
competence
established
in
dusky
and
reaffirmed
thereafter,
but
not
have
the
capability
of
carrying
out
the
tasks
that
are
needed
to
be
performed
in
order
to
try
a
case
without
it
degenerating
into
a
farce.
and
i
think,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it
would
be
well
within
the
power
of
the
trial
court
at
the
time
that
that
occurred
to
terminate
self
representation
in
order
to
further
the
state's
strong
and
important
interest
in
fairness
and
the
appearance
of
fairness.
the
question
is
whether
a
judge
can
also
make
that
decision
ex
ante
before
the
trial
has
begun
and
insist
that
the
defendant
be
represented
through
counsel.
we
think
the
answer
is
that
a
state
or
the
federal
government
would
have
a
sufficient
interest
in
terminating
self
representation
or
in
denying
a
motion
for
self
representation--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
and
our
view
is
that
the
court
should
not
necessarily
resolve
this
by
adopting
a
specific
test
that
focuses
on
the
ability
to
communicate,
but
should,
instead,
look
at
whether
the
state
has
a
sufficient
interest
that
would
be
served
by
denying
self-representation.
the
defendant's
lack
of
ability
to
communicate
can
certainly
serve
that
interest.
there
may
be
instances
in
which
the
defendant
lacks
the
memory
to
be
able
to
remember
from
day
to
day
what
happened
in
the
trial;
and
if
you
were
called
upon
to
perform
all
the
myriad
tasks
of
trial
counsel,
he
would
break
down.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
tests
serve
different
purposes.
the
competency
threshold,
as
the
court
has
noted,
is
a
minimal
threshold.
it
is
designed
to
ferret
out
whether
the
defendant
has
the
minimal
degree
of
rational
understanding
to
assist
his
counsel
and
to
understand
what's
happening.
and
he
then,
if
he
wants
to
waive
counsel,
has
to
have
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver,
which
means
he
has
to
understand
what
he's
doing.
but
those
inquiries
don't
focus
on
whether
he,
in
fact,
could
carry
out
the
substantially
more
demanding
task,
both
mentally
and
as
far
as
the
ability
to
communicate
goes,
of
presenting
a
case
to
the
jury
during
a
trial.
there
are
many
examples
of
mentally
ill
defendants
whose
world
views
may
be
substantially
skewed
in
many
respects,
but
the
competency
threshold
focuses
on
whether
they
can
understand
the
case
in
front
of
them.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
defendant
who
is
on
trial
for
making
certain
specific
threats
against
identified
people,
he
may
have
the
ability
to
understand
what
the
charge
is
and
to
assist
counsel
in
whether
he
said
those
things
and
what
he
intended
by
them,
even
if
his
world
view
in
many
respects
is
extremely
skewed;
he
has
paranoid
delusions;
and
his
ability
to
communicate
coherently
on
his
own
is
very
diminished.
and
that
is
why
the
competency
threshold
does
not
fully
address
the
very
important
interest
that
a
state
has
in
presenting
to
the
world
that
the
trial
is
a
fair
one.
this
has
both
the
dimension
of
actual
fairness
as
well
as
perceived
fairness
because
if
the
public
sees
the
spectacle
of
a
mentally
ill
defendant,
who
may
well
be
able
to
cooperate
with
counsel
and
with
the
assistance
of
counsel
get
through
a
trial,
attempt
to
communicate
to
the
jury
on
his
own
in
a
very
delusional
way,
it
really
casts
the
justice
system
into
disrepute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
under
existing
law
that
could
not
be
done
if
the
respondent's
view
of
faretta
is
adopted
as
an
absolute
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
"turning
into
a
farce".
it
is
well
established
now
that
if
the
defendant
actually
obstructs
the
proceeding,
stands
up
out
of
order,
disregards
the
judge's
procedural
rulings
and
in...
violates
the
decorum
of
the
courtroom,
self
representation
can
be
terminated.
and
that,
i
think,
is
an
important
fact
that
establishes
that
the
faretta
right
is
not
an
absolute
right.
but
here
we're
talking
about
turning
it
into
a
farce
in
a
different
way.
for
example,
in
colin
ferguson's
trial
for
murder
in
new
york,
he
got
up,
and
he
told
the
jury
in
his
opening
statement:
i've
been
charged
with
93
counts
because
it
is
the
year
1993.
if
it
were
the
year
1928,
i
would
have
been
charged
with
28
counts.
and
that
doesn't
violate
the
decorum
of
the
room,
but
it
really
casts
doubt
on
what
is
the
state
doing
here:
putting
somebody
on
trial,
having
them
represent
themselves
with
no
lawyer,
when
that's
the
mental
ability
that
they
have
to
understand
what's
going
on.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
i
think
a
translator
could
deal
with
a
non
english-speaking
defendant.
i
think
a
defendant
with
a
speech
impediment
can
be
assisted
in
other
ways.
we
actually
think
that
the
court
could
approach
this
case
by
looking
at
the
most
acute
phase
of
this
problem,
in
our
view
and
experience,
which
is
a
defendant
who
is
mentally
ill.
because
then
you
have
a
concrete
connection,
particularly
with
serious
mental
illness,
between
the
defendant's
diagnosed
state
and
the
abilities
and
capacities
that
he
may
have
when
he
takes
the
floor
as
his
own
lawyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
you
certainly
could,
justice
kennedy.
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
an
important
step
in
the
right
direction.
i
think
in
cases
where
the
judge
has,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
a
very
firm
foundation
for
understanding
that
this
defendant
could
not
present
a
coherent
defense
to
the
jury
and,
if
allowed
to
represent
himself,
would
create
a
potential
shambles...
not
that
the
trial
couldn't
go
forward
in
the
sense
there
would
nobody
courtroom
decorum,
but
in
the
sense
that
what
the
defendant
would
say
to
the
jury
would
make
no
sense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
to
force
the
state
to
have
the
train
wreck
occur,
when
the
evidence
is
very
firm
and
reliable
that
it
will
occur,
infringes
the
state's
interests
in
starting
the
trial
from
the
beginning
in
a
coherent
and
orderly
way
and
not
basically
subjecting
the
defendant
to
the
risk
of
an
unfair
trial
based
on
the
defendant's
own
incompetence.
and
this
record
is
about
as
good
as
you
are
going
to
get
on
that.
the
defendant's
communications,
which
are
in
the
jury...
which
are
in
the
joint
appendix
and
which
justice
ginsburg
has
mentioned
and
they
are
reproduced
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
show
that
although
the
psychiatrists
ultimately
concluded
that
he
could
work
with
his
lawyer,
when
you
put
him
on
his
own
and
ask
him
to
articulate
anything
to
the
judge,
which
he
did
in
great
extent,
it
made
no
sense
whatsoever.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
and
this
judge
had
also
seen
the
defendant
firsthand
during
the
first
trial.
there
had
been
years
of
competency
proceedings.
with
the
aid
of
medication,
the
defendant
was
brought
to
an
extent
where
he
was
competent
to
assist
his
counsel.
but
that
in
no
way
gave
him
the
competency
to
actually
carry
out
the
trial.
and
this
judge,
i
think,
did
the
responsible
thing.
rather
than
allow
the
defendant
to
sort
of
allow
himself
to
commit
state-assisted
suicide
by
going
before
a
trial
in
a
way
that
had
no
capacity
of
producing
a
result
that
would
truly
be
regarded
as
fair,
the
judge
said:
i'm
not
going
to
do
it;
i'm
going
to
terminate
self
representation
because
i
think
that's
in
the
best
interest
of
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
