mr.
mark
t.
stancil
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
expressed
premise
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
of
our
adversarial
system
generally
is
that
the
defense
belongs
to
the
accused
and
not
to
the
state.
the
defendant
has
the
choice
whether
to
exercise
a
particular
constitutional
right
or,
as
in
godinez,
to
present
no
defense
whatsoever.
eliminating
the
right
of
self
representation
based
on
concerns
about
a
defendant's
courtroom
ability
violates
that
fundamental
principle.
and
importantly,
the
accused
does
not
surrender
that
control
over
his
defense
simply
because
the
state's
judgment
is
that
he'd
be
better
served
by
proceeding
through
counsel.
to
the
contrary,
a
lawyer
may
speak
for
his
client,
not
because
he
needs
counsel,
but
only
because
he
has
consented
to
the
representation.
and
the
proposals
that
the
state
and
the
united
states
have
offered
here
are
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
that
bedrock
principle
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
faretta
expressly
contemplated
that
in
footnote
46.
the
court
recognized
the
limitations
on
the
right
of
self
representation,
to
include
the
rules
of
courtroom
procedure,
decorum,
and
standby
counsel.
those
are
perfectly
adequate
and
indeed,
when
correctly
enforced,
more
than
adequate
to
protect
against
the
kind
of
concern--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--correct.
but
he's
held
to
them
if
he
makes
the
decision
to
proceed.
and
that's
the
fundamental
premise
of
this
case,
is
that
a
defendant
who--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--two
responses,
your
honor.
first,
the
state's
interest
in
fairness
is...
i
think
is...
assumes
the
question,
if
you
will,
or
begs
the
question,
what
is
fair.
under
the
sixth
amendment
a
trial
is
fair
if
you
have
the
choice
whether
to
pursue
a
certain
right.
so
in
godinez,
for
example,
this
court
concluded
that
it
was
fundamentally
fair
for
the
defendant
to
sit
silent
and
to...
not
to
be
held
to
any
higher
competency
determination
for
waiving
his
right
to
counsel
and
proceeding
pro
se.
this
was
in
a
capital
case
no
less.
so,
i
think
the
state's
concern
that
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
fair
if
the
defendant
isn't
somehow
held
to
a
higher
standard
of
competency
is...
is
wrong.
the--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
i
assume
you're
speaking
about
competency
to
stand
trial
under
dusky?
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
first
of
all,
the
states
have
that
option.
that's
clear.
so,
if
the
states
are
concerned
about
the
effects
of
this
rule,
that's
always
been
their
choice.
certainly
they're
free
to
do
so.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
justice
ginsburg,
we're
speaking
about
the
competency
to
stand
trial.
and
i
think
that
was
judge...
the
chief
justice's
question.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
correct.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
because--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--because
the
sixth
amendment
says
once
you
get
to
the
adversarial
proceeding
in
court,
the
state
cannot
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
courtroom
and
second
guess
the
defendant's
decision.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
every
sixth
amendment
decision
that
i'm
aware
of
does
not
let
the
court,
in
the
name
of
second
guessing
the
defendant,
whether
a
decision
would
benefit
the
defendant
come
in
and
say:
well,
for
example,
you
may
not
want
to
take
the
stand
in
your
own
defense,
because,
well,
look
at
you;
you've
got
unsightly
tattoos
that
this
jury
may
find
offensive.
the
state
cannot
come
in
and
say:
well,
this
trial
would
be
a
farce
if
you
take
the
stand
and
so
you're
not
competent
to
exercise
that
right.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
the
logic
i
believe
is
the
same.
they
say
the
appearance
of
this
is
so
unsightly
that
we
wouldn't...
that
we
can't
allow
it
to
go
forward.
and
i
just
don't
think
that
logic
has
any
place
in
the
sixth
amendment.
to
come
back,
if
i
may,
to
the
statement
in
godinez,
in
roman
iii
of
godinez,
it
doesn't
mean
that
states
are
free
to
sever
competency
to
stand
trial
from
the
right
of
self
representation
and
raise
one
and
not
the
other.
what
it
says
is
that
states
are
free
to
elaborate
upon
the
standards
for...
elaborate
on
the
dusky
standard,
and
it
cites
medina,
which
is
a
case
about
competency
to
stand
trial.
i
think
what
it
contemplates,
and
quite
sensibly,
is
if
somebody
comes
in
and
wants
to
self
represent
and
there
are
indicia
that
that's
a
particularly
bad
decision,
that
you
may
want
to
ask
more
questions
to
determine
is
he
dusky
competent,
because
that's
what
dusky
is
about.
it
is
about
decision
making.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
that
finding
is
the
essence
of
his
legal
error.
he
says:
you
are
dusky
competent,
you
have
the
decision
making
capacity
to
stand
trial
and
in
particular
to
exercise
your
other
rights,
to
plead
guilty,
to
waive
a
trial
by
jury,
to
take
the
stand
in
your
own
defense.
but
he
says:
because
you
lack
these
courtroom
abilities,
you're
not...
you're
not
competent
somehow
to
exercise
this
additional
right.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
as
a
legal
matter,
yes.
as
a
medical
matter,
i'm
in
no
position
to
challenge--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--that
might
have
been
a
fair
argument
before
godinez,
where
the
apa
and
other
medical
organizations
advanced
this
exact
argument,
and
the
court
said...
and
if
you'll
indulge
me,
i'd
like
to
quote...
it
said
that:
"while
it
is
undeniable
that
in
most
criminal
prosecutions
defendants
could
be
better...
could
better
defend
with
counsel's
guidance
than
by
their
own
unskilled
efforts,
a
criminal
defendant's
ability
to
represent
himself
has
no
bearing
upon
his
competence
to
choose
self--
"
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i'm
not
sure
where
to
start,
your
honor,
but
if
i
could,
i'll
start
with
the
practical
problem.
it's
been
suggested
here
that
there
are...
there
are
no
ways
for
trial
judges
to
deal
with
trials
that
may
descend
into
farce,
for
example.
i
think
that's
incorrect.
take
for
example
the
rules
of
courtroom
procedure.
if
a
defendant
stands
up,
a
pro
se
defendant,
stands
up
and
says
something
that's
irrelevant
or
prejudicial
or
argumentative
in
some
way
that
violates
the
very
strict
rules
of
courtroom
procedure,
the
state
need
only
stand
up
and
say,
objection;
objection
sustained;
inquiry
terminated.
so
the
idea
that
we're
going
to
be
listening
to
20
or
30
minutes
or
hours
of
rants
is
i
think
overblown.
courts
have
that
tool.
moreover,
there's
the
additional
tool
of
standby
counsel.
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
road
that
you
have...
once
you're
committed
to
you're
stuck
with.
the
court--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
one,
certainly
the
state's
rule
has
nothing
to
say
about
that
either.
i
mean,
that's
a
perfectly
lucid
communication.
two,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
if
he...
if
he
makes
any
opening
statement
that
the
evidence
will
not
support--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
don't
think
that's
much
more
of
a
burden
than
they
do
when
they're
facing
a
defense
lawyer.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
and
that--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--justice
kennedy,
the
tool
is
right
in
front
of
the
court
in
illinois
versus
allen.
if
the
defendant
does
not
obey
your
direction,
you
have
to
warn
him;
and
if
he
continues
in
his
disruptive
behavior
or
disobeying
the
court,
you
can
take
away
his
sixth
amendment
right.
in
illinois
versus
allen,
i
think
it
is
very
crucial--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--except
that,
your
honor,
it
undermines
the
fundamental
premise
of
the
sixth
amendment,
which
is
it's
his
defense.
so,
for
example--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--not
to
my
knowledge,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i
believe
the
apa
acknowledges
in
its
brief
that
there's
not
a
lot
of
literature
about--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--but.
well...
but...
but
the
path
to...
to
a
resolution
that
doesn't
offend
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
make
the
record.
so,
for
example--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--extraordinarily
remote,
for
two
reasons.
first,
i
think
what
trial
courts
probably
need
is
encouragement
to
enforce
these
rules
against
pro
se
defendants
that
are...
that
are
at
their
disposal.
so
an
opinion
from
this
court
that
says,
reaffirms,
you've
got
illinois
versus
allen
and
you
don't
have
to
let
it
go
on
for
30
minutes.
you
can,
you
know,
nip
it
in
the
bud
and
you've
got
the
rules
of
evidence
and
rules
of
the
procedure.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
very
glad
you
brought
that
up,
because
it
illustrates
two
problems
with
this...
with
the
armchair
psychiatry
that
the
state
is
urging
here.
first,
this
letter
actually
follows
on
the
heels
of
a
motion
that
ahmad
edwards
filed
under
indiana
rule
4(c)
that
says
under
4(c)
you
have
to
try
him
within
a
year
of
charging,
and
i
have
been
tried,
i've
been
sitting
in
confinement.
so
when
he
says
"listen
to
this
case,
the
foundations
of
my
cause,
the
criminal
rule
4.
"
that
came
to
the
judge.
i
bet
good
money
the
judge
knew
what
that
meant.
now,
there
are
other
things
around
it
that
i
grant
you
are
problematic.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
but...
and
if
i
may--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
two
points.
first,
to
back
up
a
step,
we
have
no
idea,
because
the
record
is
silent
on
this,
whether
when
mr.
edwards
wrote
this
he
was
continuing
to
take
his
medication
and
receive
therapy.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
because
that's
the
reason--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--justice
souter,
this
defendant
was
rendered
competent
to
stand
trial
only
by
psychiatric
medication;
and
before
taking
away
the
right
that
is...
that
is
inherent
in
the
sixth
amendment,
the
judge
has
to
make
a
record:
is
he
still
competent
to
stand
trial
or
did
he
not
take
his
medication
this
week
and
that's
why,
that's
why
he
slipped
into
incoherence?
if
you
try
to
square
these
communications
with
dr.
sena's
report,
the
report
that
rendered
him
competent
to
stand
trial,
it's
irreconcilable.
dr.
sena--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--if
that's...
if
that's
the
case,
justice
souter,
then
there
may
be
an
error
in
the
application
of
dusky.
but...
but
once
you're
over
the
dusky
hurdle
that
says
he's
lucid
enough
to
understand
what's
going
on
and
to
make
the
fundamental--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
there
would
be
a
record
in
open
court
of
his--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
honor,
with
respect,
we
do
not.
we
have
inconsistent
pleadings.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
again,
i
respectfully
submit
that
is
not
this
case.
but
if
you
did
have
it,
i
think
you
still
have
to
give
him
the
chance,
assuming
he's
dusky-competent
and
he
makes
this
waiver
knowingly
and
intelligently,
to
stand
up
in
court
and--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--correct.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
as
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
illinois
versus
allen
explains,
that
sort
of
misconduct
can't--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
kennedy.
something
is
disrespectful
toward
the
court
if
it's
a
repeated
violation
of
the
court's
direction
to
keep
it
on
track.
and
at
the
same
time
the
defendant
is
the
one,
i
think
it's
not
to
be
lost,
that
suffers
the
prejudice
from
these
concerns.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
i
agree
that
mr.
edwards...
the
record
is
clear
that
he
was
certainly
respectful
toward
the
court.
but
i
think
a
far
more
limited
intrusion
on
the
sixth
amendment
would
to
be
say,
if
you
can't...
if
you
can't
get
something
out
that
is
comprehensible,
that's
akin
to
an
illinois
versus
allen
disruption;
and
after
a
certain
record,
it
can
be
revoked
like
the
sixth
amendment
right
at
issue
in
allen.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
he
referred
seriatim
to
a
list
of
reports
that
he
had
considered.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
the...
it's
my
understanding
that
the
most
recent,
the
actual
hearing
where
he
was
rendered
competent,
did
not
have
a
hearing
with
it.
there
was
a
report
from
dr.
sena
dated
july,
'04,
and
on
that
basis
he
was...
i
believe
there
was
an
order
rendering--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
your
honor.
mckaskle
made
that
clear,
and
it
was...
and
in
fact
faretta
makes
that
clear,
as
well,
that
the
state
can
protect
its
interests
by
having
somebody
right
behind
ready
to
stand
in.
and
i
think--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--justice
scalia,
let
me
make
it
clear
that...
i
don't
know
if
i've
made
a
concession
here.
my
response
was
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
whether
allen
is
a
fit
here.
i
suggested
and...
and
i
do
believe
that
at
least
expanding
allen
to
encompass
"incoherence"
to
mean
"disrespect"
would
be
a
lesser
offense
than
throwing
the
baby
out
with
the
bathwater.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
but
if
i
may
just
return
to
this
fundamental--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes.
however,
to
be
clear,
the
court
can
cut
him
off.
so
if
i...
if
a
pro
se
defendant
stands
up
and
says,
the
men
from
mar...
you
know,
in
his
opening
argument
says,
the
men
from
mars
told
me
to
do
this,
objection
sustained.
the
court
may
do
it
sua
sponte
and
cut
it
off.
here
we're
talking
about
seconds,
not
minutes--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--it
would
certainly
be
preferable
to
what
happened
here,
although
i
think
it
still...
i
think
it
still
has
the
problem
analytically
of
being
inconsistent
with
the
nature
of
the
sixth
amendment.
but--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
think...
let
me
be
perfectly
precise.
i
think
it
has
to
get
to
the
illinois
versus
allen
point
of
being--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
this
is
what
illinois
versus
allen
says,
and
i
think
this
will
elucidate
the
distinction:
"it
has
to
be
so
disorderly,
disruptive,
and
disrespectful
to
the
court
that
his
trial
cannot
go
forward.
"
so
what
illinois
versus
allen
says,
we
can't
have
somebody
sitting
here
that--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
believe
we're
dealing
with...
two
responses.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
we
are
dealing
with
a
null
set,
because
somebody
who
can't
say
these
things
isn't
dusky-competent
and
hasn't
made
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
if
he
can't
get
two
words
out
to
the
jury...
and
here
mr.
edwards,
if
you
read
the
oral
colloquy--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--no,
justice
kennedy.
the
dusky
analysis
is
well
settled,
and
there's
a
lot
of...
there's
a
lot
of
research
that
goes
into
that.
he
was
rendered
dusky-competent
to
make
these
decisions.
but
the
idea
that
there's
a
defendant
out
there
who
has
this
rational
understanding
and
enough
decision
making
capacity
under
dusky
to
plead
guilty
and
to
waive
any
number
of
his
constitutional
rights
is
the
same
defendant
who
turns
and
says
complete
gibberish
to--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
think
the
record...
on
the
current
state
of
the
record,
yes,
because
his--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--correct.
this
defendant
was
rendered
competent
after,
i
think,
four
and
a
half
years
of
intense...
after
a
finding
of--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
believe
it
comes
and
goes.
there
were
times
when
he
was
and
times
when
he
was
not.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
at
the
time
of
trial,
yes,
he
was.
he
made,
i
think,
lucid
statements
to
the
judge.
if
i
may,
the
judge
asked
him
at
his
first
trial,
well,
what
about
voir
dire?
he
says,
voir
dire,
that's
how
you
screen
out
jurors.
you
get
ten
charges
apiece
or
ten
strikes
apiece.
that's
perfectly
correct.
he
is
asked
how
you
admit
a
videotape
into
evidence.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
justice
ginsburg.
and,
if
i
may
explain,
that
selection
from
faretta
refers
to
whether
his
waiver
of
counsel
was
knowing
and
intelligent.
it
does
not
refer
to
whether
he
is
competent
to
exercise
the
right.
to
the
contrary,
faretta
specifically
contemplates
that
unskilled,
illiterate
and
those
of...
and
i
quote...
"feeble
intellect"
will
exercise
this
right.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
but
in
godinez
there
was.
this
was
a
defendant
who
essentially
volunteered
out
of
depression...
volunteered
for
the
death
penalty.
he
waived
counsel,
pled
guilty,
and
sat
silent
at
the
defense
table,
refusing
to
put
on
any
mitigating
evidence
while
the
state
sought
the
death
penalty.
and
this
court
held
that
is
not
fundamentally
unfair
because
he
had
had
the
choice--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but
the
reasoning
that
the
state
urges
here
is
precisely
the
reason...
reasoning
that
was
rejected
in
godinez.
they
said,
well,
he's
not
able
enough
to
perform...
this
is
what
the
defendant
said...
i'm
not
able
enough
to
perform
these
tasks,
so
you
shouldn't
have
let
me
do
it.
and
this
court
said...
again
if
i...
pardon
for
repeating
myself.
if
i
may--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--a
criminal
defendant's
ability
to
represent
himself
has
no
bearing
upon
his
competence
for
self
representation.
