chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-208,
indiana
versus
edwards.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
would
happen
if
you
started
out
with
pro
se
representation
and
then
the
trial
turned
into
a
farce?
start
over
again,
but
he
would
have
to
accept
counsel
at
that
point?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
standard
of
coherent
communication,
you
would
not
require
the
defendant,
for
example,
to
understand
the
hearsay
rule,
or
other
things
of
that
sort?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
even
if
you
don't,
i
mean,
how
is
he
going
to
effectively
participate
in
the
trial?
does
he
have
to
know,
for
example,
that
he
has
the
right
and
understand
that
he
has
the
right
to
cross
examine
witnesses?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
he...
what
if
he
wants
to
communicate
not
self
defense,
but
that,
you
know,
martians
did
it?
is
he...
and
he
can
coherently
communicate
that.
there
won't
be
any
doubt
on
the
judge's
part
or
the
jury
that
he
thinks
martians
did
it?
would
that
qualify?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
find
some
level
that
is
above
competency.
i
mean,
there
are
people
who
believe
in
martians,
but
above
competence
to
stand
trial,
but
also
that
would
still
be
coherently
communicated,
but
would
show
that
it's
a
ridiculous
defense
that's
not
going
to
be
effective
in
representing
himself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stancil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
argue
that
the
state
has
no
interest
to
be
considered
in
this
calculus?
in
other
words,
it
is
solely
the
interest
of
the
defendant
in
representing
himself
and
that
the
state
has
no
interest
in
ensuring
a
credible
process?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
an
individual
doesn't
have
to
know
and
appreciate
the
rules
of
courtroom
procedure
to
be
judged
competent
to
stand
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
suggesting
to
me
that
you
give
no
weight
to
the
state
interest.
in
other
words,
so
long
as
he's
held
to
those
rules,
that's
basing
your
determination
solely
on
his
interest
and
no
weight
given
to
the
state's
interest
in
ensuring
that
you
have
a
trial
where
people
are
observing
the
rules.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
the...
it's
really
the
flip
side
of
the
question
justice
scalia
asked.
why
shouldn't
we
be
concerned
that
if
you
have
the
same
standard
that
trial
courts
are
going
to
elevate
the
competency
showing
beyond
what
really
is
required?
in
other
words,
if
they
have
to
have
the
same
standard,
they
don't
want
a
proceeding
where
you've
got
someone
who...
you
know,
whatever
the
standard
is...
is
not
going
to
be
as
competent
or
reasonably
represented
as
he
would
by
a
lawyer,
so
they're
more
likely
to
find
the
person
incompetent
to
stand
trial
in
the
first
place?
these
are
addressed
to
two
different,
entirely
different
questions.
and
rather
than
having
a
problem
with
merging
the
standards
which
results
in
one
of
them
being
cheated,
why
don't
we
have
two
different
standards?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
why
don't
they
have
the
choice
of
elevating
the
standard
for
ability
to
represent
themselves
in
a
coherent
way
at
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
understood
godinez
to
say,
that
you
certainly
don't
have
to
elevate
your
standard,
but
i
didn't
understand
it
to
say
you
can't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
actually
doesn't
say
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
both
sides
are
kind
of
raising
these,
taking
the
arguments
to
extremes
and
they
don't
have
to
do
that.
if
you...
if
you
accept
the
fact
that
there
can
be
a
higher
standard
than
competency
to
stand
trial,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
judge
can
say
you
can't
make
the
decision
if
you
have
tattoos.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you're
putting
a
heavy
burden
on
the
state
to
say,
all
right,
now...
and
the
prosecution...
to
say,
now
we've
got
to
look
out
for
what
this
guy
is
going
to
say,
and
now
we've
got
to
appoint
standby
counsel.
and
i'm
not
sure
how
your
response
deals
with
the
guy
who
says:
i
was
indicted
for
93
counts
because
it's
1993.
i
mean,
is
the
prosecutor
supposed
to
stand
up
then
and
say:
objection,
that's
ridiculous?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
that
the
state
has
to
incur
these
extra
burdens?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
thought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stancil.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
the
case
is
submitted.
