justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
stancil,
i
mean,
you
say
make
the
record.
you
said
a
moment
ago,
have
standby
counsel
who
can
take
over.
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
the
trouble
with
these
proposals
is
that
by
the
time
the
record
is
made,
if
by
that
you
mean
courtroom
performance,
or
by
the
time
standby
counsel
is
required
to
take
over,
the
damage
is
done.
and
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
a
trial
judge
in
those
situations
who
says,
okay,
i
declare
at
this
point
that
the
trial
has
become
so
farcical
it
cannot
go
on
like
this,
the
trial
judge
at
that
point
is...
has
got
a
damaged
product
in
the
part
of
the
trial
that
has
already
taken
place.
and
the
tough
question,
i
think,
is
not
whether
he
can
simply
tell
standby
counsel
to
take
over,
but
whether
anyone
can
take
over
without
declaring
a
mistrial
at
that
point.
and
the
cost
of
mistrial
is
a
cost
in
addition
to
the
cost
that
the
state
has
been
arguing
for,
that
it
should
not
be
regarded
in
the
public
eye
as
the
sponsor
of
farces.
what
do
you
say
to
the
problem
of
the
likelihood
that
a
mistrial
is
going
to
be
the
cost
of
correcting
or
switching
over
once
the...
once
the
damage
has
been
proven?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
the
trial
judge
has
got
a
problem,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
was
on
medication
or
not
on
medication.
he
was
saying
things
like
the
things
justice
ginsburg
has
just
read.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
a
great...
frankly,
a
great
deal
of
psychiatric
testimony
is
irreconcilable
with
the
facts.
psychiatric
testimony
can
be
found
for
either
side
of
any
issue
in
cases
like
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stancil,
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
following
your
argument,
because
if
i
understand
your
most
recent
answers
to
these
questions,
it
is
no
longer
your
position
that
an
individual
who
is
not
disruptive,
but
merely
incoherent
and
making
the
trial
farcical
by
his
incoherent
responses
or
actions...
it
is
no
longer
your
position
that
an
individual
who
is
merely
incoherent
could
be
forced
in
the
midst
a
trial,
after
this
has
been
demonstrated,
to
accept
standby
counsel
to
manage
the
trial.
and,
yet
a
moment
ago
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
fail
safe
devices
that
you
were
arguing
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
to
the
disruptive
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
somebody
who
is
totally
polite
to
the
court,
who
does
not
scream
and
yell,
who
talks
only
when
he
is
allowed
to
talk,
but
talks
total
and
complete
nonsense,
can
never
be
replaced,
in
your
view,
by
a
standby
counsel
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
after
this
has
been
shown
to
be
the
way
he's
acting;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
"yes"
or
"no"?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
in
your
judgment,
was
the
dusky
determination
in
this
case
erroneous?
should
he
have
been
held
incompetent
to
stand
trial
because
of
the
nonsensical
things
that
justice
ginsburg
just
read?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
should
have
been
found
incompetent.
