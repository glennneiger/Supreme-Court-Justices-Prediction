justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
you
understand
the
respondent's
position...
and
perhaps
the
question
is
better
addressed
to
the
respondent.
but
as
you
understand
their
position,
would
they
accept
justice
scalia's
formulation
of
what
the
rule
ought
to
be
or
the
formulation
that
his
question
proposed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think...
there
is
always
a
concern
in
these
cases
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
be
creating
more
inefficiencies
for
the
judicial
system;
that
is
to
say,
the
trial
judge
was
incorrect
in
ruling
that
the
trial
was
becoming
a
farce.
i
suppose
you've
weighed
that
cost
against
the
benefits
of
the
rule.
and
what
are
the
benefits
of
the
rule,
that
the
trial
is
quicker,
that
the
appeal
is
clearer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
assume
if
there
is
error
it
would
be
structural
error--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
would
be
no
room
for
harmless
error
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
either
case,
there's
a
farce.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
very
rational
highly
competent
person
might
want
to
make
the
trial
a
farce.
why
should
that
case
be
any
different
than
where
the
person
does
so
because
he's
incompetent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
state's
interests
are
the
same.
if
the
highly
competent
person
deliberately
wants
to
make
a
shambles
out
of
the
proceeding,
the
state's
interests
are
the
same.
now,
there
are
certain
options
available.
they
can
exclude
him
from
the
courtroom
or
something,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
we
have
a
rule
that
even
if
you
are
highly
competent,
if
you
make
the
trial
into
a
farce,
you
forfeit
your
faretta
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
these
were
communications
made
to
the
judge
before
the
trial
started?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you've
presumed
in
your
answer
to
justice
breyer...
i
don't
know
if
you
fully
answered
all
of
the
questions
he
raised...
that
this
defendant
would
immediately
obey
the
objection.
that
doesn't
happen.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
don't
communicate.
it's
two
ships
passing
in
the
night
or
in
the
case
of
some
defendants
about
five
ships
passing
in
the
night.
[laughter]
so...
so
you're
presuming
something
that
that's...
that's
just
inconsistent
with
the
reality.
and
you
answered
justice
alito's
question
to
say
well,
it's
a
legal
matter;
if
it's
a
medical
matter
i
don't
comment.
but
it's
a
practical
matter;
it's
a
commonsense
matter.
we
know
what
goes
on,
and
what
goes
on
is
very
costly
to
the
state
and
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you've
got
a
record
in
open
court
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
allen
was
a
disruptive
conduct
case,
where
he
was
yelling
and
he
was
put
out
of
the
court.
that's
quite
different
from
a
defendant
who
pretends
to
comply
with
the
order
of
the
court
and
then
repeatedly
takes
everything
off
track
time
after
time.
that
was
not
allen
and
i
don't
think
you
can
cite
allen
for
the
problem
that
most
of
these
cases
present.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there's
a
difference
between
disrespectful
and
disruptive.
and
the
allen
case
was
disruptive.
i
mean,
he
was
shouting,
he
was
yelling.
everything
had
to
stop.
that
just
doesn't
apply
to
the
case
we
have
here.
it's
inapplicable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
cite
the
findings
and
the
observations
he
made
during
the
competency
hearing
in
open
court
as...
for
the
support
of
the
ruling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
competency
hearing
that
was
held
in
open
court
with
the
defendant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
one
way
to
control
these
defendants
is
to
say:
mr.
defendant,
if
you
persist
in
this
irrelevant
line
of
inquiry,
the
court
is
going
to
consider
whether
or
not
you
are
competent
under
the
indiana
standard
to
conduct
your
self
defense.
that
would
get
his
attention.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
now
you're
falling
back
on
the
very
psychiatric
evaluation
in
the
first
part
of
the
trial
that
you
disparage
in
the
second.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
don't
know
your
"yes"
or
"no"
answer.
do
you
say
he
should
have
been
found
incompetent
or
that
he
should
have
been
competent
based
on
your
present
assessment
of
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
he
competent
to
stand
trial,
in
your
view
as
you
now
understand
this
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
all
kinds
of
nuts
who
could
get
90
percent
on
the
bar
exam.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
standard
competency
principles
laid
down
by
this
court
require
that
the
defendant
be
present
and
that
he
testify
if
requested.
and
the
trial
judge
must
question
that
defendant
when
competency
comes
up
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
