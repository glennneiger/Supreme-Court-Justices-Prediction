why
shouldn't
the
law
track
medicine?
i
mean,
we're
not...
we're
interested
in
a
person
having
a
fair
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
didn't
think
this
case
has
been
decided
by
prior
precedent.
i
thought
there
was
some
opening
here.
going
back
to
what
i
think
i
said
in
martinez
and
justice
kennedy
said,
we
were...
i
was
interested
in,
and
perhaps
he
was,
in
a
few
empirical
facts,
because
we'd
heard
lots
of
complaints
from
trial
judges
who
said
this
makes
no
sense
at
all.
very
disturbed
people
are
being
deprived
and
end
up
in
prison
because
they're
disturbed
rather
than
because
there
guilty.
now,
i
wanted
to
know
the
facts.
and
it
seemed
to
me
we
have
a
excellent,
really
fabulous...
that
this
has
happened,
and
professor
hashimoto
seems
to
have
gone
and
written,
done
research,
which
we
have
in
front
of
us.
as
i
read
that
research,
i
first
learned
that
actually
the
pro
se
defendants
don't
do
a
bad
job
of
defending
themselves.
and
by
and
large,
they
do
surprisingly
well.
and
so
perhaps
that
eliminates
some
of
the
concern.
but
the
other
thing
that
it
tells
me
is
that
there
is
a
small
subclass
of
pro
se
defendants
who
may
in
fact
do
badly.
and
we
have
in
front
of
us
one
of
those
individuals
and
that,
therefore,
a
rule
which
permitted
a
state
to
deal
with
this
subclass
of
disturbed
people
who
want
to
represent
themselves,
who
could
communicate
with
counsel,
but
can't
communicate
with
anybody
else,
that
if
we
focus
on
that
subclass
and
accept
the
state's
argument
here,
interestingly
enough,
we've
gone
a
long
way
to
deal
with
a
serious
practical
problem,
and
we've
advanced
the
cause
of
seeing
that
individuals
have
a
fair
trial.
so
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
that,
and
that
was
my
reaction
after
reading
that
study.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
response
to
that,
as
it
was
to
me,
i
take
it
to
be:
well,
focusing
on
this
subclass,
the
judge
has
other
ways
of
dealing
with
the
problem.
my
thought
about
that
is,
first,
i
don't
know.
maybe
the
damage
is
done
by
that
point
before
the
jury
or
elsewhere.
and
my
second
thought
is,
because
i'm
not
certain
about
whether
your
answer
is
right
or
wrong,
nor
are
any
of
us
really,
this
is
a
perfect
instance
where
the
states
should
experiment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
isn't
on
this,
but
of
course
part
of
the
job
of
being
a
psychiatrist
or
a
psychologist
or
a
doctor
is
continuously
to
evaluate
the
accuracy
of
studies.
so
if
it's
a
general
question,
i
guess
the
question
is
of
course
there
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
second
case
--
the
third
case
is
not
so
complicated.
here,
a
state
court,
that's
indiana
v.
edwards,
a
state
court
found
the
criminal
defendant
in
this
case
competent
to
stand
trial
if
he
was
represented
by
counsel,
mentally
competent.
but
he
is
not
mentally
competent
to
conduct
the
trial
proceedings
himself
without
a
counsel,
that’s
what
the
trial
judge
said.
the
indiana
state
supreme
court
concluded
that
this
court's
precedents
don't
allow
that,
that
they
require
the
trial
court
to
allow
the
defendant,
nonetheless,
to
conduct
the
trial
proceedings
himself.
so,
we
have
to
decide
whether
that’s
so.
does
the
constitution
forbid
a
state
from
insisting
that
the
defendant
like
this
who
the
state
thinks
is
not
competent
mentally
to
conduct
the
proceedings
himself?
does
it
forbid
a
state
for
insisting
that
such
a
defendant
proceed
to
trial
with
a
lawyer,
not
without
one?
thereby,
denying
the
defendant
the
right
to
represent
himself
under
the
sixth
amendment
which
we
have
explained
the
case
called
faretta.
we
conclude
that
the
state
may
insist
a
defendant
be
represented
by
counsel
where
that
defendant
is
not
mentally
competent
to
conduct
the
trial
proceedings
himself.
first,
in
our
view,
the
relevant
precedents
do
not
decide
the
question
presented
here.
they
assume
the
constitutional
right
of
self
representation.
they
assume
that
that
right
set
forth
in
faretta
can
be
limited
in
various
ways.
second,
the
mental
competency
that
a
defendant
needs
to
represent
himself
during
the
trial,
can
differ
dramatically
from
the
mental
competency
he
needs
to
proceed
to
trial
with
a
lawyer,
and
third,
to
permit
a
defendant
to
represent
himself
a
trial
when
he
is
mentally
incompetent
to
do
so.
in
our
opinion,
does
not
at
all
affirmed
that
defendant's
dignity
but
rather
it
threatens
to
undermine
the
most
basic
of
the
constitution's
criminal
law
objectives,
namely,
providing
a
fair
trial.
we
add
that
the
trial
judge
is
in
the
best
position
to
determine
the
presence
or
degree
of
the
defendant’s
mental
competence.
and
we
conclude
that
the
state
may
insist
that
a
criminal
defendant
be
represented
by
counsel
at
the
trial
when
that
defendant
who
is
mentally
competent
to
stand
trial
with
a
lawyer,
is
not
mentally
competent
to
stand
trial
without
one.
and
these
points
which
are
a
little
abstract,
are
very
concretely
and
very
well-represented
by
the
facts
of
this
case
right
before
us
which
are
explained
in
the
opinion.
so,
we
vacate
the
decision
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
