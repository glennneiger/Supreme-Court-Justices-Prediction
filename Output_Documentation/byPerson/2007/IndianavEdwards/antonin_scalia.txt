justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
it
necessary
to
have
a
special
rule
in
order
to
prevent
the
trial
from
descending
into
a
farce?
why
couldn't
you
simply
apply
the
same
rule
of
competency
that
you
apply
for
whether
the
defendant
can
be
tried,
and
then
if
in
fact
his
self
representation
begins
to
turn
the
trial
into
a
farce
surely
the
court
would
have
the
power
to
prohibit
his
further
self
representation.
certainly,
turning
a
trial
into
a
farce
is
a
basis
for
the
court's
action;
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
with
taint
would
be
his
own
fault.
i
can't
imagine
that
he
would
success
on
appeal
claiming
he
tainted
the
jury.
and
the
advantage
of
waiting
is
that
by
waiting
to
see
if
in
fact
he
will
turn
the
trial
into
a
farce
you
avoid
the
risk
of
depriving
him
of
his
right
to
represent
himself,
which
is
certainly
a
very
important
constitutional
right.
why
didn't
you
wait
to
see
whether
he's
going
to
be
able
to
pull
it
off
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
must
be
precedents.
i'm
sure
under
the
old
rule,
if
i
can
recall
it
the
old
rule,
where
you
have
a
single
standard
for
both
the
right
to
be
tried...
the...
the
ability
to
be
tried
and
the
right
to
represent
yourself,
there
must
have
been
instances
in
which
the
person
who
was
representing
himself
was
unable
to
cope
and
the
trial
was...
was
turning
into
a
farce.
there
must
have
been
instances.
what
did
they
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
proceeds,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
test
that
you're
going
to
apply
ex
ante?
whether
he's
able
to
coherently--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
what's
the
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
cannot
communicate
coherently?
i
sometimes...
i
sometimes
think
that
the
lawyers
cannot
communicate
coherently.
[laughter]
it's
really
a
vague
test,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
surely
his
total
ignorance
of
all
of
the
trial
rules,
the
hearsay
rule
and
the
other
details
of
conducting
a
trial,
is
a
great
disadvantage.
but
we
allow
him
to
toss
that
away
so
long
as
he
knows
he's
tossing
it
away.
that
the
judge
instructs
him:
you're
ill
advised
to
proceed
on
your
own;
you're
not
a
lawyer;
this
is,
you
know,
a
complicated
process;
are
you
sure
you
want
to
represent
yourself?
and
if
he
says
yes,
we
say,
well,
you
know,
you've
brought
it
on
yourself.
why
can't
we
say
the
same
thing
about
his
supposed
inability
to
communicate
effectively,
unless
and
until
he
turns
the
trial
into
a
farce?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
the
standard
of
review
be?
i'm
a
reviewing
court.
the
judge
has
not
allowed
this
person
to
represent
himself.
what's
the
standard
of
review?
abuse
of
discretion
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
your
test,
the
same
test:
inability
to
communicate
no
matter
how
idiotic?
i
mean
this
man
is
living
in
a
fantasy
world.
he
understands
that
he's
on
trial,
but
his
whole
world
is
just...
he
not
only
believes
in
martians,
he
thinks
we
are
all
martians,
or
something
like
that.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
pick
on
just
the
ability
to
communicate?
it
seems
to
me
there
are
a
lot
of
defects
that
can
turn
the
trial
into
a
farce.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
worry
at
all
that
if
we
adopt
a
separate
test
for
the
ability
to
represent
yourself,
that
the
inevitable
effect
will
be
for
the
test
for
being
able
to
be
tried
to
become
less
and
less
rigorous?
justice
antonin
scalia
after
all,
there's
no
harm
done
so
long
as
the
person
can't...
is
not
allowed
to
represent
himself.
i
think
there
may
be
some
value
in
linking
the
two,
so
that...
so
that
the
court
knows
that
if
he
finds
the
individual
capable
of
being
tried,
he
may
have
to
begin
a
trial
with
this
individual
representing
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
gets
to
be
bad,
the
court
can
terminate
it
and
say,
you
know,
you
can't
represent
yourself.
we're
going
to
bring
in
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
it
could
be
done
if
the
trial
is,
indeed,
turning
into
a
farce.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
not
just
change
the
rule
about
what
you
can
do,
once
the
trial
is
under
way?
you
say
sometimes
it's
not
a
farce.
it's
just
that
this
person
is
obviously
incapable
of
making
a
coherent
defense.
why
not
wait
to
see?
what
i
object
to
in
the
proposal
is
making
these
judgments
ex
ante
on
the
basis
of...
i
don't
know...
psychological
testing
or
past
behavior
or
anything
else.
give
it
a
try.
the
person
wants
to
represent
himself.
it's
his
constitutional
right.
if,
indeed,
it
turns
out
that
this
is
turning
into
a
sham,
fine,
bring
in
a
lawyer
to
represent
him.
but
doing
it
beforehand
on
the
basis
of
your
prediction
as
to
what
the
trial
is
going
to
turn
into
seems
to
me
not
to
give
enough
respect
to
an
individual's
desire
to
represent
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
they
have
their
choice,
you
meant
they
have
the
choice
of
elevating
the
standard
that
applies
to
the
competency
to
stand
trial
if
they
wish?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
any
psychiatric
studies
that
show
how
accurate
psychiatric
studies
are?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
estimate,
for
example,
how
accurately
one
can
predict
whether
a
particular
defendant
will
indeed
be
able
to
defend
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
just
have
a
record
in
open
court.
you
have
the
experience
of
a
trial
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
more
than
just
the
stuff
that
was
on
the
record.
you've
had
the
experience
of
a
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
concede
that
if
the
trial
is
not
disruptive,
the
mere
fact
that
this
fellow
is
making
an
incompetent
defense
or,
indeed,
may
be
making
no
sense
is
justification
for
terminating
the
trial?
i
mean,
this
person
can
plead
guilty
if
he
wishes
and
that's
perfectly
okay.
can
he
not
take
the
lesser
step
of
putting
forward
an
incompetent
defense?
the
state
is
still
going
to
have
to
plead...
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
the
case
goes
to
the
jury
that
he
committed
the
crime
that
he's
accused
of,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
i
don't
know
why
the
mere
fact
that
his
defense
is
incompetent
or
even
is
making
no
sense
would
justify...
if
that's
what
he
wants
to
do
instead
of
pleading
guilty,
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
what
the
right
of
an
individual
consists
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
position
is
it
has
to
be
disruptive.
if
it's
not
disruptive,
even
if
he's
making
no
sense,
that's
his
choice,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
except,
as
you
say,
we
don't
know
whether
he
was
on
his
medication
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fisher,
what
if
the
defendant
here
promised
to
sit
silent
during
the
trial
as
the
defendant
did
in
godinez?
would
that
be...
would
that
render
everything
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
he
could
certainly
sit
silent.
having
decided
to
represent
himself,
he
could,
if
he
wished,
just
sit
silent.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
he
writes
badly.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
fair
does
a
trial
seem
to
the
public
where
the
defendant
stands
up
and
says,
your
honor,
i
want
to
represent
myself?
i
do
not
want
this
attorney.
i
want
to
defend
myself.
and
the
judge
said,
sit
down,
we
have
a
psychological
evaluation
of
you.
you
can't
represent
yourself.
how
fair
does
that
seem
to
the
public?
