do
you
think
your
rule
would
create
an
incentive
for
trial
judges
in
close
cases
to
always
deny
self
representation?
because
certainly
most
trials
proceed
more
efficiently
and
less
trouble
for
the
judge
if
you
have
a
lawyer
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question:
do
you
think
the
inability
to
speak
english
would
be
a
factor
that
the
judge
could
take
into
account
in
making
this
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stancil,
can
i
ask
this
question:
do
you
agree
that
at
a
certain
point
in
the
trial
it
could
become
a
farce
and
the
judge
could
declare
a
mistrial
for
this
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
did
so,
he's
going
to
have
a
second
trial.
could
he
decide
before
the
second
trial
starts
that
the
man
has
to
have
a
lawyer
or
could
the
man
still
demand
the
right
to
self
represent?
he's
had
to
proceed...
he
spoke
to
the
one...
you
know,
one
mistrial.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
your
position
he'd
have
the
right
to
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
he
had
a
record
in
open
court
before
the
trial
started
that
was
just
as
persuasive
as
events
going
sour
during
a
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
one
other
question:
do
you
think
the
faretta
right
includes
a
right
to
have
no
standby
counsel?
