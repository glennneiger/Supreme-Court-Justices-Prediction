if
the
state's
objective
is
to
make
sure
that
there
is
a
reasonably
fair
trial
or
something
that
resembles
a
fair
trial,
isn't
that
going
to
result
in
the
denial
of
self
representation
in
a
great
number
of
cases?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it
is
the
case,
as
a
lot
of
people
believe,
that
it
is
very...
it's
the
rare
case
in
which
a
lay
defendant
can
adequately
represent
himself
or
herself,
then
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
disagree
with
the
point
that's
made
by
the
american
psychiatric
association
that
competency
is
not
a
unitary
concept,
that
a
person
can
be
competent
to
assist
an
attorney
at
trial
but
not
competent
to
make
all
of
the
decisions
and
perform
in
some
minimally
reasonable
way
the
various
tasks
that
have
to
be
performed
during
the
course
of
a
trial?
