let
me
give
you
a
concrete
illustration
that
was
brought
up
by
the
other
side.
if
you
have
this
coherent
expression
test,
what
happens
to
the
person
who
has
a
bad
speech
impediment?
or
someone
who
needs...
who
isn't
conversant
in
the
english
language?
are
they...
automatically
the
right
of
self
representation
is
automatically
ruled
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fisher,
are
you
making
essentially
a
"we
know
it
when
we
see
it.
"
argument?
because
you're
not
talking
about
some
abstract
notion
of
what
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
you
have
in
your
brief...
you
have
at
pages
15
and
16...
some
examples,
concrete
examples
of
this
defendant.
and
you
could
say
when
it
gets
to
that
level,
you
don't
have
to
wait
to
see
how
it's
going
to
play
out.
if
this
is
how
this
man
speaks
and
thinks,
how
could
a
jury
be
exposed
to
it?
it
would
be
gibberish.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
argument
is
it's
not
a
choice,
that
there
is
only
one
standard,
either
you're
competent
or
you're
not
competent?
that
is,
i
thought
your
position
is
competency
is
a
unitary
notion
and
your
opponent's
position
is,
no,
there
are
shades
of
competency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
a
trial
judge
who
has
a
very
practical,
immediate
concern.
and
he's
not
looking
at
dusky,
not
looking
at
peretz.
he
says:
i
have
found
that
mr.
edwards
is
able
to
stand
trial
with
the
assistance
of
an
attorney.
i
never
made
any
finding
that
he
was...
that
he
was
competent
if
he
didn't
have
that
aid.
i
never
found
that
he
was
competent
to
defend
himself.
he's
competent,
but
only
if
he
has
a
lawyer
who
is
running
the
show.
that
was
the
finding
that
the
trial
judge
made:
that's
my
finding.
are
you
telling
me
to
make
that
finding
i
have
to
say
that
he's
not
competent
to
stand
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well...
suppose
the
judge,
the
trial
judge,
says:
mr.
stancil,
please
turn
to
page
15
of
the
blue
brief.
i
have
had
considerable
communication
with
this
defendant.
read
what
it
says
there.
do
i
have
to
wait
for
this
to
be
repeated
in
the
courtroom?
"listen
to
this
case,
the
foundations
of
my
cause.
"
"the
criminal
rule
4.
"
"court's
territory,
acknowledged
may
29,
2001,
abandoned
for
the
young
american
citizen
to
bring
a
permissive
intervention
acting
as
the
forces
to
predict
my
future
disgrace
by
the
court
to
motion
young
americans
to
gather
against
crime.
"
now,
that's
not
an
isolated
incident.
this
record
is
full
of
that
kind
of
statement
coming
from
this
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
take
the
rest
of
the
paragraph.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
to
stop.
i
mean,
you
have
given
a
reason
that
this
might
make
sense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
judge
says:
does
that
means
i
have
to
sit
here
and
every
time
he
makes
a
statement
like
that
explain
to
the
jury
what
he
meant?
then
i'm
becoming
involved
myself
in
a...
in
a
consulting
role,
not
as
an
impartial
judge
of
this
case
anymore,
but
as
a
kind
of
a
facilitator
of
the
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stancil,
you
do
agree
that
the
basic
precedent
on
which
you
rely,
faretta,
you
would
be...
you
are
asking
for
an
extension
of
it
because
that
case
starts
out
with
a
defendant
who
is
described
as
literate,
competent,
understanding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
was
there
anything
in
the
record
showing
that
he
had,
that
faretta
had,
mental
delusions,
mental
disease?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
judicial
posture
there
was
a
little
different.
it
was
a
question
of
what
the
state
had
to
do,
not
what
the
state
could
do.
