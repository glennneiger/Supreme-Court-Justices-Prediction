mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
trial
court
was
justified
in
requiring
a
higher
level
of
competency
for
self
representation
in
order
to
prevent
the
trial
of
ahmad
edwards
from
descending
into
a
farce.
indeed,
self
representation
where
a
defendant
cannot
communicate
coherently
with
the
jury
or
the
court
would
defeat
the
very
autonomy
interests
that
the
court
ventured
to
protect
in
faretta.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
certainly
hope
so.
and
i
think
on
the
record
we've
got
here
the
trial
court
did
not
need
to
wait
for
that
to
happen.
if
the
trial
had
begun
with
mr.
edwards
representing
himself
with
the
jury
present,
and
the
trial
had
then
become
so
unwieldy
and
so
farcical
and
such
a
mockery
that
he
had...
his
right
of
self
representation
had
to
be
overridden,
i
think
there
would
have
been
a
problem,
a
possible
problem
of
taint
with
the
jury.
i
think
that
the
court
was
justified,
having
seen
mr.
edwards
in
court--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i
don't
think
that
mr.
edwards's
sort
of
waiver
by
conduct
in
that
context
is
the
only
thing
to
consider.
i
think
that
the
state's
interests
in
having
a
proceeding
that
proceeds
smoothly
without
episodes
that
render
the
proceedings
potentially
a
mockery
also
are
strong.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
you
know,
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
they
would.
it
seems
to
me
that
their
position
is
much
more
focused
on
the
metes
and
bounds
of
what
faretta
specifically
recognized,
which
was
requiring
the
defendant
to
comply
with
the
rules
and
if
there
is
a
disorderly
kind
of
behavior
that
would
be
sufficient.
but
i
don't
read
their
position
to
be
that
someone
who
is
lacking
in
communications
skills
and
coherent
communications
skills
even
on
the
record
in
the
trial
would
be
someone
whose
right
of
self
representation
could
be
overridden.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
in
a
world
here
where
we
don't
really
know
what
the
precise
rules
would
be
because
of
the
lack
of
clarity
for
the
trial
courts.
so
i
don't
want
to
tell
you
exactly
what
the
indiana
courts
would
do,
but
i
would
imagine
that
a
trial
judge
would
be
faced
with
a
decision
based
on
how
long
the
trial
has
gone
on,
what
the
level
of
complexity
of
the
trial
is,
what
the
level
of
farce
or
taint
could
be
for
the
jury.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
in
the
cases
where
this
happened,
whether
it's
because
the
trial
was
turned
into
a
farce
or
because
the
defendant
was
excluded
from
the
courtroom,
as
in
illinois
v.
allen,
i
think
the
trial
often
proceeds.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
but
i
guess
what
i'm
suggests
is
that
there
is
always
going
to
be
the
possibility
in
terms
of
a
discretionary
judgment
call,
whether
it's
a
systematic
rule
or
whether
it's
something
up
to
the
trial
judge,
that
the
court
may
decide
that
in
interest
of
fairness,
that
the...
you
know...
all
the...
all
that's
gone
on
needs
to
be
restarted,
particularly
if
it
hasn't
gone
on
very
far.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
a
rule
in
that
regard.
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--oh,
the
test.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
the
rule
that
we
are
suggesting...
and
again
let
it
caution
that
this
is
not
a
rule
adopted
by
the
indiana
supreme
court
yet...
is
that
it
is
within
the
state's
authority
to
override
this
right
where
the
defendant
cannot
communicate
coherently
with
the
court
or
the
jury.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
don't
think
it's
any
worse
in
terms
of
vagueness
than
what
we
deal
with
in
dusky.
now,
dusky
talks
about
a
reasonable
level
of
understanding
and
a
reasonable
ability
to
assist
the
lawyer.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
no.
i
think
that
in
circumstances
such
as
those,
there
is
another
level
of
analysis,
which
is
whether
there's
some
sort
of
accommodation
that
can
be
made
that
would
allow
the
representation,
self
representation,
to
proceed
by
means
of...
whether
it's
an
interpreter
or
another
means
of
communication.
but
what
we're
dealing
with
with
ahmad
edwards
is
someone
whose
thought
processes
so
decompensate
and
become
so
disorganized
that
it's
not...
it's
not
a
matter
of
having
an
interpreter
to
carry
out
his
instructions.
it's
a
matter
of
having
someone
who
can
actually
formulate
a
coherent
defense
and
communicate
that
to
the
court
and
to
the
jury.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
we're
not
asking
to
get
into
that
kind
of
level
of
detailed
knowledge.
all
we're
suggesting
is
that
once
the
defendant
has
made
the
choices
that
are
forced
upon
him
essentially
by
the
trial,
i.e.,
the
decision
to
represent
himself
and
the
decision
whether
to
present
a
defense
or
not,
that
he
can
actually
carry
that
out;
whatever
it
is
that
he
wants
to
do
within
the
rules
of
the
court,
that
he
has
the
capability
of
effectuating
that.
and
that's
the
problem
ahmad
edwards
had.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
we
can,
but
we
need
not,
i
think
is
the
point.
and
it's
because
there's
a
world
of
difference
between
lack
of
legal
knowledge
and
the
inability
to
relay
a
kind
of
coherent
message
that
any
person,
lawyer
or
not,
of
ordinary
kind
of
mental
ability,
capacity,
would
be
able
to
formulate.
i
think
that
there
are
substantial
doubts
about
whether
somebody
like
ahmad
edwards
could
convey
to
the
jury
that,
in
fact,
what
he
wants
to
present
is,
for
example,
self
defense.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
that
he
may
be
thinking
that
and
that
may
be
something
that
faretta
entitles
him
to
want
to
pursue
on
his
own,
but
we're
concerned
that
he
couldn't
in
front
of
a
jury
communicate
that
that's
what
he
was
trying
to--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
i
think
we're
getting
hopefully
not
into
an
area
where
there
would
be
legitimate
questions
about
underlying
dusky
competency.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
in
that
circumstance
you
could
have
that
level
of
concern
as
well.
and
then,
beyond
that,
if
someone
is
using
a
sort
of
insanity
demonstration
in
the
context
of
the
trial,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
could
fall
back
on
not
this
rule,
but
on
the
rule
that
there
has
to
be
a
defense
that's
within
the
bounds
of
the
rules
of
the
court.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
do
think
there's
a
line
that
can
be
drawn
between
a
ridiculous
defense
that's
within
the
bounds
of
sort
of
relevance
and
possibility,
such
as,
you
know,
a
very
ill
advised
self
defense
theory,
and
the
idea
that
the
martians
did
it,
which
i
think
raises
substantial
questions
as
to
dusky
competency
as
well.
now,
i
think
that
even
looking
at
the
court's
later
cases
after
faretta,
if
we
look
at
martinez
and
mckaskle,
we
see
the
same
sense
of
balancing
that
is
what
we're
advocating
here.
i
think
that
mckaskle,
recognizing
that
is
a
role
sometimes
for
standby
counsel
and
that
it
is
to
be
limited,
is
something
that
starts
down
this
road.
and
we're
not
talking
about
a
rule
here
i
think
that
would
threaten
the
underlying
decision
that
faretta
protects.
we're
talking
about
a
rule
that
is
simply
designed
to
let
a
trial
court
ensure
that
the
decisions
that
the
defendant
makes
are
going
to
effectuate--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
i
think
the
benefits
of
the
rule,
first
and
foremost,
is
that
the
state
has
and
the
judicial
system
has
greater
certainty
that
there
was
a
fair
trial,
that
the
adversarial
process
played
out
in
a
way
that
gave
the
jury,
you
know,
a
meaningful
decision
to
make,
and
also
that
it
conveys
to
the
public
that
this
is
a
reliable
system.
now,
you're
very
right.
this
may
introduce
inefficiencies,
and
we
don't
know
what
the
indiana
supreme
court
would
make
of
that
in
its
role
as
the
supervising
court
for
the
indiana...
for
the
indiana
courts.
but
i
think
that
what
courts
have
an
impression
of,
including
the
indiana
supreme
court,
is
that
they're
not
allowed
to
undertake
that
balance,
that
godinez
and
faretta
combine
to
preclude
that
option,
and
that's
what
we
want
the
court
to
clear
up,
to
say
that
they
do
have
that
option.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
that
they're...
trial
courts
are
always
going
to
be
concerned
about
going
too
far
and
being
reversed
on
those
grounds.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
kinds
of
concerns
that
they
deal
with
when
they're
making
an
evaluation
of
dusky
competency
and
making,
you
know,
evaluation
of
whether
a
waiver
is
known
and
voluntary,
those
kinds
of
incentives
would
kind
of
be
the
same
here
in
terms
of
not
wanting
to
go
too
far.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
think
so.
i
think
it
would
be
something
very--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--very
much
akin
to
what
we
look
at
with
dusky.
whether
there
are
factual
determinations
may
be
reviewed
for
clear
error,
but
the
overall
judgment
is
essentially
an
abuse
of
discretion,
a
deferential
kind
of--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
that...
we're
not
suggesting
a
rule
that
is
unlimited
in
that
regard.
the
concern
for
fair
trial
is
something
that
i
think
in
a
lot
of
other
sixth
amendment
contexts
has
some
leeway,
but
it
also
has
limits.
in
the
wheat
case,
for
example,
where
the
court
overrode
the
choice
of...
first
choice
paid
counsel
in
view
of
conflicts
of
interest
and
the
fairness
questions
those
raised,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
been
terribly
concerned
that
interest
runs
wild
and
that
it
overrides
that
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
again,
i
think
that
there
is
a
qualitative,
a
real...
a
sort
of
realistic
line
to
be
drawn
between
someone
who
maybe
has
bad
ideas
and
bad
judgments
and
someone
who
just
cannot
communicate
what
those
judgments
are.
in
other
words,
someone
who
is
unable,
particularly
in
an
unstructured,
stressful
environment,
to
communicate
what
it
is
that
their
message
is
to
the
jury,
to
the
judge--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--well,
i
think
that
there--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--because
i
think
that
the...
the
kinds
of
decisions
that
someone
would
make
that
would
be...
i
think
even
if
well
communicated,
would
demonstrating
a
farcical
trial,
would
threaten
the
dusky
competency
standard.
they
would...
they
would
raise
questions
in
that
regard.
now,
if
someone
just
had
a
bad
notion
of
what
it
is
to
defend
themselves
and
what
idea
they're
trying
to
present
to
the
jury,
i
don't
think,
if
that
is
communicated
coherently,
that
that
presents
the
same
concerns
of
a
farcical
trial
that
we
have
with
ahmad
edwards.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
again,
i
think
that
there
are
limits
on
what
we're
arguing,
and
i
think
that...
that
the
wheat
case
demonstrates
how
there
can
be
flexibility
here
in
terms
of
pursuing
these
fairness
interests
without
overriding
completely
the
self
representation
interests...
or,
i'm
sorry,
the
sixth
amendment
interests
of
a
larger
set
of
defendants.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
right.
and
i
think
that
you
don't
really
have
an
unwieldy
standard
here
any
more
than
with
respect
to
dusky
when
you're
looking
at
evaluations
of
statements
and
other
things
that
the
defendant
might
have
made.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
i
think
the
defendant
in
godinez
was
pleading
guilty.
i
think
here
if
you
have
a
defendant
where
it
might
create
a
different
question
if
there
was
some
reliable
that
evidence
that
that
might
be
true.
but
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
that
if
a
trial
court
would
have
to
take
the
defendant's
word
for
it
entirely,
that
he
would
sit
silent.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
i
think
it
does
present
a
different
situation
if
the
defendant
sits
silent
and
relies
only
on
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction
than
to
have
a
defendant
who
is
going
to
present
an
actual
defense.
here
i
think
you
have
got
a
defendant
who,
while
competent
at
the
time
of
trial,
the
day
before,
a
few
days
before
trial
wrote
a
letter
to
the
court
saying:
dear
judge
hawkins,
i
want
to
extend
the
court
power
for
training
for
this
enormously
wide
defense
to
exercise
also
u.s.
continent
five
as
it
becomes
more
advanced
parts
differently
to
structure
first
amendment.
trial
to
do
your
best
old
man
to
isolate
the
young
boy
in
me
at
this.
so
i
think
we
have
got
a
clear
example
of
someone
who
could
communicate
with
counsel
as
the
sena
report
indicated.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
well,
no.
i
think
even
in
the
statements
in
open
court
you
have
got
a
lack
of
coherence
and
lack
of
understanding.
and
counsel
was
there,
i
think,
to
usher
through
some
of
those
statements
that
made
system
somewhat
comprehensible.
but
there's,
i
think,
every
reason
for
the
court
to
look
at
these
writings
and
to
also
fall
back
on
what
he
had
seen
in
open
court
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
somebody
who
couldn't
be
relied
phenomenon
communicate
coherently.
i
think
relying
on
the
allen
standard
is
a
mistake
for
the
additional
reason
in
addition
to
not
specifically
covering
this
kind
of
scenario,
it
also
might
then
lead
to
circumstances
where
trial
courts
are
tightening
up
the
allen
standard
for
all
defendants
whose
wish
to
represent
themselves.
so
even
when
you
don't
have
concerns
about
this
kind
of
competency,
the
courts
are
going
to
be
in
a
position
where
they
look
at
this
court's
precedent
and
say,
oh,
we're
supposed
to
enforce
allen
strictly
and
we
have
got
a
rules
violation,
so
therefore,
we
have
to
override
the
self
representation
request.
and
i
think
that
that's
probably
not
what
the
court
would
want
to
do
just
to
provide
that
as
a
vehicle
for
dealing
with
dependents
such
as
ahmad
edwards.
now,
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
bear
in
mind
that...
that
we
can
speak
about
fairness
in
trial
and
the
appearance
of
fairness
in
trial
and
not
be
speaking,
strictly
speaking
about
due
process,
about
the
due
process
clause.
and
that's
the
point
of
the
wheat
case.
we
don't
have
to
think
that
the
state's
concerns
for
fairness
are
limited
by
the
due
process
clause.
we
can
acknowledge
that
there
are
other
circumstances
that
courts...
that
trial
courts
in
states
can
take
into
account
when
they
are
dealing
with
sixth
amendment
rights.
and
there,
of
course,
it
was
the
sixth
amendment
right--
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
--i
think
it...
i
think
many
in
the
public
would
think
that
that
was
fair.
that,
in
fact,
the
court
is
taking
care
of
a
defendant
in
those
circumstances.
now,
that
is
counterbalanced
by
the
faretta
right.
but
i
think
courts...
state
courts
and
state
systems
should
be
in
the
position
of
taking
into
consideration
what
they
think
appears
fair
in
that
kind
of
circumstance.
mr.
thomas
m.
fisher
right.
and
i
think
there
are
opportunities,
then,
to
be
concerned
about
competency
based
on
psychiatric
reports
that
could
lead
to
a
dusky
determination
in
addition
to
determination
that
we're
seeking.
