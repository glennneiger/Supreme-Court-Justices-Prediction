mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
this
court's
precedents
and
universal
international
law
norms,
the
government
of
iraq,
like
all
sovereign
nations,
has
a
sovereign
right
and
jurisdiction
to
try
and
punish
individuals,
including
american
citizens,
who
voluntarily
enter
its
borders,
commit
crimes
in
its
country,
and
remain
there.
in
two
independent
respects,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
omar
case
lost
sight
of
that
principle
and
departed
from
this
court's
precedents:
first
by
exercising
habeas
jurisdiction
at
all;
and
second
by
sustaining
an
injunction
that
the
court
of
appeals
itself
recognized
prevented
the
government
of
iraq
from
trying
and
punishing
mr.
omar
for
any
crimes
that
he
committed
in
iraq.
as
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
we
believe
that
this
court's
decision
hirota
versus
macarthur
points
to
the
conclusion
that
habeas
jurisdiction
is
lacking
over
these
cases
because
the
habeas
petitioners
are
being
held
under
international
authority
pursuant
to
determinations
made
by
an
international
multinational
force
acting
and
carrying
out
a
united
nations
mandate,
and
in
mr.
munaf's
case
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
iraqi
courts
that
he
remain
in
custody
while
proceedings
go
forward
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
that
is
the
difference,
justice
souter.
and
i
think,
to
be
clear,
if
this
court
does
find
jurisdiction
in
these
cases,
we
think
that
citizenship
would
be
a
basis...
would
have
to
be
the
basis
for
jurisdiction,
and
we
urge
this
court
to
limit
its
decision
to
that
ruling,
because
that
would
have
profound
practical
consequences.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true,
and
let
me
explain
why
we
think
that
hirota
does
govern
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
notwithstanding
that
this
case
involves
citizens
and
notwithstanding
that
the
petitioners
in
hirota
had
been
the
subject
of
an
international
conviction.
first
of
all,
we
don't
think
that
hirota
would
have
come
out
differently
if
the
habeas
petitioners
had
filed
suit
earlier
and
sought
to
enjoin
the
international
proceeding
in
hirota
and
sought
an
injunction
that
would
have
prevented
the
conviction
from
taking
place.
secondly,
we
do
think
that,
although
one
obviously
has
to
take
a
careful
look
at
the
court's
decision
in
hirota,
we
think
that
what
the
court
did
say
points
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
the
international
authority
that
was
key
to
the
court's
finding
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
i
think
there's
at
least
a
couple--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
obviously
the
court
reached
that
conclusion
in
hirota
as
to
aliens.
with
respect
to
citizens,
i
think
that
the
key
for
the
jurisdictional
question
under
the
habeas
statute
is
whether
or
not
these
individuals
are
in
custody
under
and
by
color
of
united
states
authority.
just
as
the
court
presumably
concluded
in
hirota
that
the
petitioners
in
hirota
were
not
under
custody
under
color
of
united
states
authority,
we
think
that
the
petitioners
here
are
not.
and
so
we
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
i
can
make--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--two
points
in
response
to
that.
first,
ultimately
the
united
nations
controls
the
strings
and
the
source
and
the
scope
of
international
authority.
the...
the
current
security
council
resolutions
are
set
to
expire
in
december.
it
could...
it
could
eliminate
those
resolutions
today
and
that
source
of
international
authority
would
exist
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
that
these
individuals
are
being
held
pursuant
to
international
mandate.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
there
has
been
a
subsequent
resolution.
it's
resolution
1790,
and
that
resolution
is
set
to
expire
this
december.
and
the...
the
government
of
iraq
and
the
other
parties
have
indicated
that
this
will
be
the
last
extension.
obviously,
they'll
have
to
assess
the
situation
in
december.
but
the
international
authority
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
briefing
continues
to
exist.
the
other
point
i
was
going
to
make,
justice
souter,
is
your
point
about
american
domination
or
influence
over
the
multinational
force
was
equally
true
with
respect
to
the
force
in
hirota.
you
had--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--so
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
basis
for
distinguishing
hirota.
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
again,
i
think
that
hirota...
the
amount
of
influence
that
the
united
states
forces
have
over
the
international
force
isn't
a
basis
for
distinguishing
hirota.
but
to
get
to
your
point
about
citizenship,
i
guess
we
would
say
a
few
things.
one,
we
that
think
the
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
hirota
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
recognized
that
the
theory
of
the
court's
decision
in
hirota
doesn't
lend
itself
to
a
citizenship
exception.
the
habeas
statute,
as
this
court
emphasized
in
the
rasul
case,
doesn't
have
a
citizenship...
doesn't
distinguish
between
citizens
and
aliens,
and
it
has
since
1789
contained
the
requirement
that
the
person
be
in
custody
under
or
by
color
of
united
states'
authority.
so--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
the
concurring
opinion.
we're
relying
on
the
court's
decision
in
hirota,
but
we
look
at
the
concurring
opinion;
we've
looked
at
the
briefs.
we've
tried
to
discern
the
best
principle
of
law
from
that
decision.
and
the
principle
that
we
think
it
stands
for
is
that
where
individuals
are
held
under
international
authority
by
the
judgment
of
several
nations,
not
the
law
of
any
single
nation,
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
review
the
custody
of
such
individuals.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
if
i
can
make
a
couple
of
points.
one,
the
parties
in
hirota,
the
habeas
petitioners,
made
very
clear
that
they
weren't
asking
this
court
to
review
the
international
conviction.
they
made
very
clear
that
they
were
asking
this
court
to
review
the
actions
of
american
officers
under
united
states
law.
they
made
that
clear
on
page
14
of
their
merits
brief,
where
they
said...
and
i'm
quoting
here...
"we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
review
the
decision
of
international
court.
"
--end
quote.
and
quoting
again:
"all
the
questions
deal
solely
with
official
actions
taken
by
general
macarthur
as
citizen
and
u.s.
army
officer.
"
and
again
on
page
15,
quote:
"we
repeat
again
that
we
bring
into
question
only
unlawful
action
taken
by
general
macarthur
for
us.
"
the
other
point
that
i
would
make
is
these
individuals...
they
haven't
been
convicted
pursuant
to
a
trial,
like
the
individuals
in
hirota,
but
these
individuals
are
being
held
pursuant
to
determinations
made
by
the
multinational
force
carrying
out
the
international
mandate.
in
mr.
omar's
case,
he
not
only
received
a
three-judge
tribunal
shortly
after
his
detention
and
capture,
but
he
also
received
a
determination
before
a
nine-officer
combined
review
release
board,
consisting
of
six
iraqi
officials
and
three
multinational
force
officials,
who
determined
that
he
was
a
security
internee
who
should
be
detained
in
accordance
with
the
united
nations
mandate.
now,
mr.
munaf's
case
did
proceed
before
the
iraqi
criminal
court
because
an
injunction
was
not
entered
against
those
proceedings.
the
iraqi
court
initially
did
enter
a
conviction.
that
conviction
was
reversed
on
appeal
by
the
court
of
cassation.
we
think
that...
that
the
recent
decision
is
significant
in
a
couple
of
respects.
i
think,
one,
it
underscores
there
is
an
iraqi
legal
system,
that
that
system
is
capable
of
processing
these
cases
and
hearing
from
these
individuals,
and
is
capable
of
granting
relief
where
appropriate
action
isn't
taken.
and,
two,
the
iraqi
court
order
setting
aside
the
conviction,
much
like
an
appellate
order
in
this
country
would,
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings
but
directed
that
mr.
munaf
and
his
codefendant--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
both.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
individuals
are
detained
by
the
multinational
force
while
there
are
proceedings
before
the
iraqi
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
in
mr.
munaf's
case,
there
were
four
investigative
hearings
and
a
trial,
after
which
he
was
convicted.
in
mr.
omar's
case,
if
he
were...
if
the
proceedings
were
allowed
to
go
forward,
he
would
remain
in
mnfi
custody
during
the
course
of
the
iraqi
proceedings.
and
then,
if
there
is
a
conviction
and
that
conviction
is
sustained
on
appeal,
the
iraqi
government
issues
an
order,
a
transfer
order,
to
the
multinational
force.
the
multinational
force
makes
a
determination
to
carry
out
that
order.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and,
again--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
are
24,000
people
currently
being
held
by
the
multinational
force,
the
vast
majority
of
whom
obviously
are
aliens.
two
thousand
individuals
held
by
the
multinational
force
have
been
transferred
to
iraqi
custody.
many
if
not
most
of
those
individuals
have
undergone
court
proceedings
because
the
multinational
force
is
obviously
working
in
close
coordination
with
the
iraqi
government
to
bring
to
justice
people
who
have
committed
crimes
in
iraq.
and
if
i
could
turn
to
the
second
question,
because
we
think
that
there
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
say
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
the
allied
forces--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
is
not,
justice
breyer.
an
american--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--official
has
the
supreme
command--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
same
was
true
with
respect
not
only
to
the
tribunal,
but
the
allied
forces--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
hirota.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct.
and
ultimately
the
key
point,
we
think,
is
that
those
forces
were
acting
under
international
mandate.
the
far
eastern
commission
in
hirota
ultimately
had
say
over
what
the
force
could
do--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--whereas
the
united
nations
here
ultimately
has.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
that
that's
true,
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
united
nations
today
could
repeal
the
resolutions
authorizing
this
international
force
and
the
specific
mission.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
they
would
be
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states.
we
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
that
this
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
so,
ultimately,
an
international
body
distinct
from
the
united
states
is
controlling
the
strings--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--as
is,
in
our
view,
general
petraeus.
he
is
sharing
now
the
authority--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
it
does,
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
already
indicated
to
justice
ginsburg.
that
wasn't
the
argument
the
parties
were
making
in
hirota.
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
say
that
they
weren't
challenging
the
international
conviction,
that
they
were
challenging
the
actions
of
the
american
officers
acting
under
international
law.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
did.
and
if
i
could
turn
now
to
the
second
issue,
because
we
do
think
there
is
a--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--analytically,
it
would
be
the
same,
justice
stevens.
as
a
practical
matter,
united
states
forces
don't
act
under
international
authority;
and,
thank
goodness,
multinational
forces
don't
act
in
the
united
states.
it
would
make
a
difference
as
to
the
second
question,
which
is
to
say
if
the
individuals
were
detained
in
the
united
states
and
there
was
a
question
of
transferring
back
to
iraq,
that
would
be
a
classic
extradition
situation.
and
we'd
have
a
whole
different
body
of
case
law
governing
these
individuals--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--absolutely.
in
iraq
it's
undisputed
that
if
the
multinational
force
were
to
release
them,
the
iraqi
authorities
could
arrest
them,
take
them
into
their
custody.
the
injunction
that
we
face
today
is
one
preventing
the
iraqi
courts
from
going
forward
with
any
proceedings
against
mr.
omar,
preventing
the
multinational
force
from
sharing
information
with
iraqi
authorities
about
the
circumstances
of
his
release,
and
directly
preventing
the
multinational
force
from
transferring
these
individuals
to
iraqi
custody
if
they
are
convicted.
the
laws
of
this
court...
we
go
back
to
reid
versus
covert,
the
schooner
exchange...
makes
clear
that
when
american
citizens
go
abroad
voluntarily
into
other
countries,
commit
crimes
in
those
countries,
and
remain
in
those
countries,
they
cannot
come
back
to
this
country
and
complain
about
the
offenses
they
committed,
nor
complain
about
the
modes
of
trial
and
punishment
available
in
those
countries.
the
court
made
that
express
in
the
neely
versus
henkel
case.
and
at
least
on
the
second
question,
we
think
that
that
principle
establishes
that
the
u.s.
force,
even
assuming
it
has
habeas
jurisdiction
to
review
their
detention
by
the
mnfi,
shouldn't
be
in
a
position
of
directly
thwarting
iraq's
sovereign
right
and
jurisdiction
to
try
these
individuals
and,
if
they
find
that
they
committed
offenses,
punish
them
for
offenses
committed
in
iraq.
american
citizens--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
we
would
maintain
that
american
citizens,
when
they
go
abroad,
they
have
to
take
what
they
get.
i
think
there
is
some
suggestion--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what...
i
think
what
this
court
said
in
neely
versus
henkel...
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
122,
and
i
think
it
partially
answers
your
question,
justice
kennedy:
"the
suspension
clause
has
no
relation
to
crimes
committed
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
against
the
laws
of
a
foreign
country.
"
if
this
court
thinks
that
it
would
be
different
if
there
were
no
system
of
fairness
or
process,
then
it
could
reserve
that
question
for
another
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
and
here,
justice
kennedy,
the
iraqi
courts
are
functioning
under
principles
that
require
fundamental
standards
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
habeas,
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
is
concerned
with
the
fact
or
duration
of
custody.
i
think
if
we're
talking
about
things
that
could
happen
to
people
that
would
be
a
different
type
of
action.
american
courts
might
be
open
in
that
extreme
situation.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
an
exercise
that's
ever
been
available
in
habeas.
i
think
that
the
closest
analog
of
this
court's
cases
to
this
situation
is
perhaps
wilson
versus
girard,
where
you
had
an
american
serviceman
stationed
in
japan
who
committed
alleged
offenses
in
japan,
and
the
japanese
authorities
made
a
request
that
they
take
jurisdiction
of
that
person
to
prosecute
him
for
offenses
in
japan,
and
this
court
considered
the
question.
there
was
an
injunction
against
the
transfer
of
that
individual
to
japanese
authorities.
this
court
set
the
injunction
aside
because
it
found
no
affirmative
bar
on
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
recognizing
the
sovereign
right
and
jurisdiction
of
the
government
of
japan
to
prosecute
individuals,
including
american--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--let
me
make
a
practical
and
a
legal
point
on
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
reports
of
torture
and
abuses
in
the
iraqi
system
all
deal
with
the
ministry
of
the
interior
and
the
ministry
of
defense.
we
point
that
out--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
i
don't
believe
he
was
pointing
to
any
reports
of
systematic
abuses
within
the
department,
the
ministry
of
justice.
and
that's
what
our...
our
own
state
department
concluded
in
its
most
recent
reports
on
this.
and
if
you
look
at
all
the
reports,
including
the
most
recent
report
that
came
out
a
couple
weeks
ago
from
the
united
nations
assistance
mission
in
iraq,
they
point
to
alleged
abuses
within
the
ministry
of
interior
and
defense.
these
individuals
would
be
going
to
the
justice
system.
we
don't
have
reports
of
systematic--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
and
that
was
the
legal
point
that
i
was
going
to
make.
even
in
the
extradition
context,
where
everyone
agrees
that
there
would
be
habeas
jurisdiction
to
review
a
transfer
for
some
reason,
the
courts
have
not
entertained
allegations
of
torture,
recognizing
that
those
considerations
are
uniquely
for
the
executive,
except
when--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
because
for
centuries,
justice
souter,
the
courts
have
recognized
that
these
are
matters
for
the
executive
to
assess,
because--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
there
we
weren't
talking
about
habeas.
i
think
if...
and
my
answer
was
if
the
court
is
concerned
about
that
situation,
this
isn't
it.
it
can
reserve
it
for
a
different
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
what
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
maybe
this
court
would
have
to
do
if
it
were
going
to
entertain
allegations
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
right,
and
general
garner
explained
that
on
page
48
of
the
appendix.
the
other
thing
i
want
to
make
on
torture--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
would
be
none,
justice
alito.
and
these
individuals
are
represented
by
iraqi
counsel,
by
american
counsel.
they
have
access
to
iraqi
ombudsmen.
they
can
make
reports.
they
can
make
reports,
as
some
detainees
have,
to
the
iraqi
investigative
judges
of
alleged
mistreatment;
not
torture,
but
iraqi
investigative
judges
have
directed
that
mistreatment
not
occur.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it's
not
the
situation
that
the
ngo
brief
described,
because
all
of
those
reports
are
focused
on
ministry
of
interior
and
defense,
where
these
individuals
are
not
going
to...
u.s.
court,
even
in
the
extradition
context,
don't
review
these
allegations--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
so.
respect
for
the
prerogative
of
the
executive
in
making
its
determinations,
respect
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
iraqi
courts.
you
have
a
habeas
court
having
discovery
and
who
knows
what
types
of
proceedings
as
to
what
is
going
on
in
iraqi's
criminal
justice
system.
i
think
this
court
would
give
respect
to
the
justice
systems
of
other
sovereign
nations.
this
is
a
system
which,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
is
founded
on
principles
of
fairness.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
no,
emphatically
not,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
this
court
confronted
a
similar
situation
in
the
padilla
case
a
couple
of
years
ago.
and
what
it...
it...
there
was
a
habeas
petition
filed
in
new
york,
and
it...
the
court
held
that
that
habeas
petition
was
improperly
filed
and
a
different
petition
should
be
filed
in
south
carolina.
and
it
didn't
get
into
the
question
of
the
transfer.
and
we
certainly...
we
don't
think
that
transfer--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--whether
the
habeas
court
could
direct
that
he
be
brought
back
to
portland?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
the
habeas
court
would--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
would
say
probably
not,
justice
souter.
i
mean
there
are
transfers
all
the
time
where
habeas
petitions
are
filed,
and
people
are
going
from
state
authority
to
federal
authority.
and
the
rule
is
that
those
transfers,
of
course,
can
take
place.
the
habeas
proceedings
can
continue.
the
habeas
has
traditionally
been
used
to
block
transfers.
here...
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
injunction
that
the
court
of
appeals
sustained.
it
is
an
injunction
against
allowing
the
iraqi
prosecutions
to
proceed
because
the
court
enjoined
american
officials
from
presenting
mr.
omar
to
the
iraqi
courts.
now,
mr.
margulies
said
that
they
didn't
enjoin--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
the
injunction
says...
and
it
is
on
page
59a...
is
that
it
bars...
of
the
petition
appendix
in
the
omar
petition,
the
gray
petition,
and
i
am
quoting
now:
"shall
not
remove
the
petitioner
from
the
united
states
or
mnfi
custody,
or
take
any
other
action
inconsistent
with
this
court's
memorandum
opinion.
"
"any
other
action
inconsistent
with
this
court's
memorandum
opinion.
"
is
allowing
the
prosecution
to
proceed,
and
the
court
of
appeals
makes
this
express
on
page
25a
of
the
petition
appendix
where
the
court
of
appeals
majority
says,
quote,
"we
agree
with
the
dissent
that
the
injunction
prohibits
the
military
from
presenting
omar
to
the
ccci
for
trial.
"
now,
mr.
margulies
said
that
the
proceedings
can
go
forward
just
without
his
client's
presence,
but
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
would
be
a
vast
improvement
over
the
injunction
that
was
held
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
then
you
are
dealt...
you
are
left
with
the
transfer,
the
injunction
on
the
transfer
to
the
iraqi
authorities
in
the
event
that
mr.
omar
is
convicted.
and
on
that,
i
confess
to
being
not...
not
being
entirely
clear
as
to
what
my
friend's
position
is.
he
says
that
we
can
release
him
because,
of
course,
that
is
the
office
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say:
but
we
can't
release
him
in
a
way
that
would
affect
a
transfer.
i'm
not
sure
what
that
means
because
i
thought
he
also
said
that
we--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--just
to
underscore
the
affront
to
the
iraqi
sovereignty
on
this,
his
clients
acknowledge
that
they
can
be
arrested
by
iraqi
officials
for
crimes
they
allegedly
committed
in
iraq
if
they
were
released.
but
the
injunction
that
they're
asking
this
court
to
sustain
is
an
injunction
that
prevents
the
multi-national
force
in
iraq
from
telling
iraqi
authorities:
we
are
going
to
release
these
petitioners
at
12:00
o'clock
tomorrow.
in
effect,
they're
asking
for
an
eight-hour
head
start
so
that
these
individuals
whom
the
multi-national
force
has
determined
pose
threats
to
the
security
of
iraq,
who
iraq
has
determined
pose
threats
to
the
security
of
iraq,
that
an
american
court
is
enjoining
the
multi-national
force
from
conveying
that
information
to
the
iraqi
authorities
so
that
these
individuals
who
went
to
iraq
voluntarily
can
be
held
to
account
in
he
iraqi
system
for
crimes
that
they
committed.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
[laughter]
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true.
but
we
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
from
this
court's
decisions
that
if
they
don't
have
the
authority
to
enter
the
preliminary
injunctive
relief
that
they
did
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
have
no
authority
to
enter
it
as
a
preliminary
matter.
i
think
on
the
jurisdictional
point,
the
one
point
i
wanted
to
stress
is
that
if
this
court
does
find
jurisdiction
we
think
it
has
to
be
because
of
a
reading
of
the
habeas
statute
informed
by
the
constitution
that's
limited
to
citizens.
extending
jurisdiction
to
everyone
in
iraq
would
be
an
extraordinary
expansion
of
this
court's
decision
in
rasul.
just
to
be
clear,
camp
cropper
in
iraq
bears
none
of
the
characteristics
of
the
guantanamo
bay
that
this
court
discussed
in
its
opinion
in
rasul
and
that
justice
kennedy
emphasized
in
his
concurrence.
so
any
jurisdictional
ruling
by
this
court,
we
would
urge
it
to
rule
only
to
the
circumstances
here
of
the
fact
of
citizenship.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
there
are
both.
this
have
been
2,000
transfers
of
individuals
from
multinational
force
to
iraqi
custody,
most
in
connection
with
criminal
proceedings.
the
other
individuals
are
held
because
they're
a
security
threat.
a
lot
of
individuals
come
in
and
out
of
detention.
obviously
the
multinational
force
tries
to
limit
the
detentions
as
much
as
possible.
here
the
reason
why
these
people
have
been
subsidy
contained
so
long
is
because
the
american
courts
have
stood
in
the
way
of
the
iraqi
criminal
proceedings
where
the
iraqi
courts
have
sought
to
bring
justice
to
these
people
under
iraqi
law.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it's...
we
don't
take
the
position
this
is
like
a
battlefield
situation.
the
occupation--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--certainly
there
are
active
hostilities
in
parts
of
iraq.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
the
occupation
has
ended.
i
think
there
are
active
hostilities
in
part
of
it.
we
have
not
argued
that
there
is
no
habeas
jurisdiction
because
of
the
hostilities
there.
we've
argued
that
there
is
no
habeas
jurisdiction
because
they're
being
held
under--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
if
the
court
believes
that
that's
our
strongest
argument,
certainly
we
don't
have
any
objection
to
having
you
address
it.
[laughter]
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
jurisdictional.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
