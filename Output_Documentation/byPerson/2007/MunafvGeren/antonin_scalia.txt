a
lynch
mob
doesn't
require
investigation
by
american
courts
of
the
internal
workings
of
a
foreign
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
think
it
would
be
quite
extraordinary
to
investigate
the
government
of
iraq.
that's
a
matter
that
the
executive
can
take
into
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
for
an
american
court
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
margulies,
the
prologue
to
the
constitution
does
say
"to
preserve
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity.
"
there
is
something
to
the
notion,
isn't
there,
that
the
constitution
provides
constitutional
rights,
including
the
right
to
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
to
americans
or
to
anyone
who
is
in
america;
but
to
say
that
the
whole
world
has
rights
under
the
constitution
is
extravagant.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
margulies,
could
i
ask
a
few
questions
about
the
multinational
force
involved
here?
do
you
acknowledge
that
in
theory,
at
least,
the
united
states
in
its
capacity
here
is
subject
to
the
control
of
the
united
nations?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
says?
i
mean,
a
transfer
is
one
thing
and
saying
you're
free
to
go
and
the
iraqi
government
picks
him
up
is
something
else.
why...
why
do
you
equate
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
of
course
it
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
why
do
you
say
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
war,
then?
they
are
holding
them
as
security
detainees.
aren't
they...
aren't
they
worried
that
if
they
just
let
them
go,
they'll
go
right
back
to
killing
americans
and
iraqis?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
arguing
that.
i'm
just
questioning
your
statement
that
it's
irrelevant
that
this
is
occurring
in
a
war
zone.
it
is
not
at
all
irrelevant.
one
of
the...
the
reason
they're
being
detained
is
precisely
because
this
is
a
war
zone.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
an
eight-hour
lead
is
enough?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
make
a
good
movie.
