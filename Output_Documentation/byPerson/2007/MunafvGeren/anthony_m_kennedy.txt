justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
habeas
corpus
is
concerned
with
the
safety
of
the
prisoner
to
the
extent
that
it's
controlled
by
our
authorities.
and
if
you're
in
the
united
states,
could
an
officer
release
a
prisoner
knowing
that
a
lynch
mob
was
outside?
i
should
think
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
this
is
just
a
hypothetical
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
really
wanted
to
get
your
answer
to
justice
stevens's
first
question
straight.
you
think
citizenship
is
not
relevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
were
not
basing
your
case
on
the
citizenship?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
might
have--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
why
didn't
you
answer
justice
breyer...
and
we've
interrupted
you
a
couple
of
times.
you
have
the
box.
he's
going
to
be
released.
they
want
him.
i
don't
see
then
why
you
didn't
answer
justice
breyer's
question
differently.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
we're
doing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
we're
doing
is
we're
testing
the
authority
and
the
propriety
of
the
district
judge
to
proceed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
why
we
are
asking
if,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
order
is
a
release,
is
there
a
problem?
and
i
should
think
you'd
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
begging...
you're
begging
a
question...
you're
inserting
a
premise
that
we
have
to
decide,
whether
the
release
is
unlawful.
we're
asking,
that's
part
of
the
equation.
i'm
the
district
judge.
can
i
say,
i've
looked
at
all
this,
i
want
this
prisoner
released
tomorrow
morning;
and
if
the
iraqis
pick
him
up,
fine
with
me?
can
i
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
your
statement
is
wildly
overbroad:
that
there
is
a
due-process
restriction
on
release
by
the
united
states
government
to
another
sovereign?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
have
an
undercover
agent
in
japan
who
finds
a
drug
dealer,
he
gives
him
to
the
japanese
police.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
that.
that's
a
sweeping
statement.
that
just
can't
be
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you've
just
said
that
it's
unlawful.
you
said
that
an
american
law
enforcement
officer
working
in
another
country
who
takes
custody
of
a
wanted
criminal
cannot
turn
him
over
to
the
government
of
that
country.
that's
just
got
to
be
wrong.
