justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
answer
to
a
previous
question,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
the
individuals
here
were
tried
by
an
iraqi
tribunal
they
would
remain
in
the
custody
of
the
multinational
force
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
is
that
correct?
does
that
mean
that
they
would
simply
be
transported
to
court
and
then
brought
back
to
the
custody
where
they
are
at
the
present
time
during
the
course
of
those
proceedings?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
just
to
follow
up
on
that,
at
what
point
during
that,
during
the
trial,
would
there
be
any
potential
for
torture
by
iraqi
authorities.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
still
don't...
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying
about
citizenship.
you
said
earlier
it
wasn't
necessary,
and
it
make
as
big
difference.
there
are
thousands
of
u.s.
citizens
being
held
in
iraq.
your
argument
with
respect
to
your
clients
is
that
they
have...
they
can
file
habeas
petitions
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
they
can't
be
turned
over
except
pursuant
to
the
extradition
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
iraq;
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
could
just
then
finish
the
question.
pursuant
to
the
extradition
treaty
or
some
other
authorization;
if
citizenship
isn't
important,
then
why
can't
all
of
those
thousands
of
non-citizens...
or
can
all
of
those
thousands
of
non-citizens...
who
are
being
held
in
iraq
file
habeas
petitions
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
argue
that
they
can't
be
turned
over
except
pursuant
to
the
extradition
treaty
or
some
other
authorization?
