there's
another
difference,
too.
there
was
a
conviction
and
a
sentence
in
hirota,
here
in
omar's
case
he
has
not
yet
been
as
far
as
we
know
even
investigated
by
the
iraqi
courts,
certainly
no
conviction;
and
in
munaf's
case
the
conviction
has
been
quashed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
just
to
clarify
one
point.
the...
at
the
time
of
the
briefing,
the
u.n.
resolution
was
due
to
expire
in
december
of
2007.
has
it
been
renewed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
it
is
at
least
equally
plausible,
i
think,
because
it's
the
only
factor
that
hirota
mentions
more
than
once,
that
the
court
was
going
on
its
lack
of
power
"to
review,
to
affirm,
set
aside,
or
annul
the
judgments
and
sentences
imposed.
"
there.
and
here
we
have
no
judgment
or
sentence.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
pick
one
of
these
strands,
citizenship,
and
say,
oh,
that's
it
and
it
isn't
the
judgment
and
sentence.
so
i
think
we
know
your
position.
this
is
an
opinion
that
says
"under
the
foregoing
circumstances".
i
don't
think
you
can
take
it
much
further
than
saying
citizenship
was
one
of
those
circumstances.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
are
in
the
u.s.
custody
a
number
of
non-citizens.
is
that...
how
many
people
are
being
held
in
the
custody
of
the
multinational
force
that
the
united
states
controls?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
court
certainly
listed
it
as
a
circumstance;
and,
as
i
said
before,
it's
the
only
thing
that's
repeated
in
the
opinion.
but
i
think
that
we've
come
to
a
standoff
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
an
important
distinction,
i
think.
at
least
in
this
case
it
has
been
alleged
that
if
these
people
are
released
to
iraqi
custody,
there
is
a
high
risk
that
they
will
be
subject
to
torture
and
other
abuse.
you
know
the
brief
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
ngos
where
there
is
a
quotation
from
iraq's
deputy
justice
minister:
"we
cannot
control
the
prisons.
"
"it's
as
simple
as
that.
"
"our
jails
are
infiltrated
by
the
militias
from
top
to
bottom,
from
gaza
to
baghdad.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
quotation
from
the
deputy
justice
minister.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
ask
you
about
that,
because
if
your
basic
point
is
that
here
is
an
officer
of
the
united
states
that
has
someone
in
custody--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--someone
who
is
in
jeopardy,
among
other
things,
of
being
tortured--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
united
states
official
has
to
safeguard
a
citizen?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
can
throw
a
non-citizen
into
the
lion's
den?
is
that
the
instruction
that
the
united
states
gives
to
its
officers,
take
care
of
our
citizens,
but
the
rest
of
the
world,
we
don't
care?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
making
this
distinction
now.
justice
kennedy
asked
you
does...
does
your
case
turn
on
citizenship,
and
you
said
citizenship
is
very
important.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
thousands
of
noncitizens
that
are
being
held
in
the
very
same
circumstance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but
in
the
cases--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
he...
he
is
still
within
the
iraqi
criminal
justice
system.
he
wasn't...
his
case
wasn't
dismissed.
it
was
sent
back
for
further
investigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what's
happening
in
his
case
is
he's
undergoing
a
criminal
process
in
iraq;
and
we
are
holding
him
during
that
process.
so
if
you're
not
objecting
to
our
holding
him
while
the
process
is
going
on,
what
is...
what
is
he
seeking
through
habeas?
he...
he
can't
get
out
from
under
the
iraqi
criminal
justice
system.
he
is
alleged
to
have
committed
crimes
within
iraq.
we
are
holding
him
safe
while
that
process
is
going
on.
so
what
is
the
basis
of
his
petition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
get
up
to
transfer.
this
man
is
now
under
investigation
in
the
iraqi
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
we...
transfer
isn't
an
issue.
what
do
you
want
done
with
him
while
he's
subject
to
the
criminal
process
in
iraq?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
distinct
difference
in
munaf's
case:
he
is
undergoing
a
criminal
process
in
iraq,
and
omar
has
also...
it
is
alleged
that
he
has
committed
offenses
in
iraq.
has
no
prosecution,
no
investigation
been
started
with
respect
to
omar?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
see
that
in
the
injunction,
itself.
it
just...
the
injunction
was
very
spare.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
one
could
go
agree...
let's
say
one
could
agree
that
was
overbroad.
does
that
mean
that
the
whole
injunction
falls?
let's
say,
take
two
pieces
out
of
it:
no
information
sharing;
that's
beyond
the
pale.
and
you
can't
make
an
order
that
a
foreign
court
shouldn't
hear
a
case.
take
those
two
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
about
the
rest
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
have
a
basic
question:
is
there
habeas
jurisdiction;
and,
as
i
understand
the
posture
of
this
case,
the
federal
courts
did
not
examine
the
merits
of
the
habeas
petition.
they
were
just
hung
up
on
the
bare
jurisdictional
question.
