one
more...
i'd
like...
on
the
first
question,
in
reading
through
this,
my
impression
was
that
the
government...
and
the
green
briefs,
you
know,
the
dark
green
briefs
against
you
from
the
military
justice
institute
and
the
national
security
specialists
really
don't
disagree.
that
is
that
everybody
seems
to
agree,
to
use
the
words
general
casey
said,
that
u.s.
soldiers
in
iraq
are
subject
to
the
authority,
direction,
and
control
of
the
commander
of
the
u.s.
central
command.
and
you
say
in
your
brief
that
really
this
multilateral
force
operates
subject
to
a
unified
american
command,
and
the
chain
of
command
ultimately
runs
to
the
president.
so
as
a
practical
matter
it's
the
president
and
the
pentagon,
the
secretary
of
defense,
and
the
american
commanders
that
control
what
our
american
soldiers
do.
i
take
it
there's
agreement
on
that
point,
but
where
there's
disagreement
is
that
you
say,
well,
the
same
was
true
with
that
tribunal
at
issue
in
hirota.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
so
we're
not...
we're
not...
i
take
its
you
say
that,
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
a
matter
of
the
chain
of
command,
it
runs
through
american
officers
to
american
commanders
to
the
secretary
of
defense
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
disagreement
about
that,
or
is
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
then
if
there
is
not...
if
there
is
not,
am
i
right
in
thinking
the
issue
is
whether,
because
the
words...
there's
some
connection
with
foreign
governments,
absolutely.
there's
some,
but
it
doesn't
interfere
with
that
chain
of
command.
and
now
your
point
is:
but
the
same
was
true
with
the
tribunal
at
issue
in
hirota.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
same
was
true.
it
was
general
macarthur.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that's
because
the
president,
i
take
it,
would
follow
what
the
un
says,
not
because
the
chain
of
command
would
change.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that
happened,
these
people
would
be
released?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
relevance
of
that
is
general
macarthur
was
an
agent
of
several
allied
powers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then,
to
me,
it's
a
matter
of
hirota
at
the
moment,
and
the
only
distinction
you
haven't
addressed
is
at
that
time,
i
think
in
1946,
the
basic
habeas
rule
was
that
you
wouldn't
question
a
judgment
of
a
tribunal,
at
least
not
a
foreign
tribunal.
and
it
was
just
beginning
in
the
issue...
to
question
judgments
in
american
tribunals.
and,
therefore,
the
obvious
question
is:
well,
doesn't
that
explain
hirota?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
have
only
the...
the
citizenship
to
stop
the
floodgate.
what
i'm
wondering
is...
when
i
read
the
briefs,
i
put
in
my
mind
a
spectrum
and
on
one
side
is
the
military
occupation
of
japan,
where
there
is
basically
peace
but
it's
a
military
occupation.
on
the
other
side,
it's
a
hot
war
or
a
guerilla
war
where
the
u.s.
forces
are
rounding
up
troops,
nightly
perhaps,
and
rounding
up
guerillas.
and
i
had
put
this
case
quite
close
to
the
military
occupation
in
my
mind
because
of
the
nature
of
these
particular
individuals'
offense
and
treatment.
but
was
i
wrong
to
do
that?
should
i
assimilate
this
case
to
either
a
hot
war
or
at
least
a
guerilla
warfare,
where
troops
are
actively
engaged
in
rounding
up
those
who
want
to
shoot
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is,
look,
suppose
the
government
comes
in
tomorrow,
or
in
the
district
court,
you're
back
there.
and
the
government
says
you
want
us
to
release
him.
at
noon
tomorrow,
we
will
take
him
to
the
front
gate
and
release
him.
do
you
want
us
to
do
it?
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
need
all
that
to
win
this
case.
that
is,
as
i
started
the
case
i
thought
this
involved
an
american
being
held
by
the
military
for
over
a
year
pending
the
resolution
of
criminal
charges
in
iraq,
which
are
charges
of
kidnapping
in
respect
to
which
whatever
hot
war
is
going
on
over
there
has
very
little
to
do
with
his
being
held.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you've
been
arguing
for
all
sorts
of
things
that
seem
far
broader
than
that.
so
i'd
like
to
focus
you
for
a
second
on
that
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
am
i
right
to
assume
the
underlying
situation
to
be
that
of
hirota?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
you
see
what
i
mean
by
that?
i
mean,
these
issues
of
the
war
zone
and
so
forth
are
not
really
there
in
this
case;
that
we're
talking
here
about
a
person
whose
being
held
in
a
manner
that's
comparable
for
habeas
purposes
to
the
japanese
or
aliens
who
were
held
in
hirota.
they're
being
held
by
the
army,
which
is
in
part,
which
is
in
relevant
part
serving
as
an
occupying
force,
to
be
turned
over
to
a
different
tribunal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
thank
you.
