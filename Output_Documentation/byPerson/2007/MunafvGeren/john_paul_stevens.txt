justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
in
the
materials,
then
perhaps
i
should
have
known,
but
did
the...
i
take
it
munaf
was
present
and
was
represented
by
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
did
that
work?
was
he
present
in
american
custody
and
then
he
goes
to
the
iraqi
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
he
just
goes
every
day
to
the
iraqi
court
and
then
he
comes
back
at
night
to
u.s.
custody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question.
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
the
place
of
detention
was
in
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
could
they
be
released
to
a
lynch
mob?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
case...
does
your
case
depend
entirely
on
the
fact
that
these
are
american
citizens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
were
not
american
citizens,
would
there
be
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
citizenship
is
irrelevant
on
the
jurisdictional
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
how
you
can
avoid
taking
that
question.
that
what
bothers
me.
how
can
you
avoid
addressing
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
aware
of
any
cases
in
which
we
have
held
that
habeas
jurisdiction
is
available
to
a
citizen
where
it
would
be
not
available
to
a
non-citizen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
second
question:
do
you
think
the
place
of
detention
has
any
relevance
to
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
whether
or
not
it's
a...
there
are
ongoing
hostilities
would
have
any
relationship
to
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
that
does
not
exist
in
iraq
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
place
of
detention
has
always
been
iraq?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
place
of
detention
has
always
been
iraq?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
legal
issue
be
the
same
if
there
were
violent
ongoing
hostilities
in
iraq?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
have
any...
any
precedent
in
our
cases
for
saying
that
that
test
would
apply
during
an
active
combat
in
a
zone
of
hostilities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
very
different
place
of
detention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
are
you
saying
then
that
the
zone
of
hostilities
does
not
include
all
of
iraq?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
if
we
thought
otherwise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
we
thought
otherwise?
what
if
we
thought
all...
all
of
iraq
is
a
zone
of
hostilities?
would
we
have
a
different
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
say
that
the
united
states
lacks
the
power
to
transfer?
suppose
this
fellow
had
been
arrested
in
the
street
by
a
sergeant
in
the
army
and
he
says,
what
will
i
do
with
him?
i'll
take
him
to
the
iraqis
and
turn
him
over.
would
that
be
an
illegal
transfer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
sergeant
caught
this
guy,
and
he
wants
to
turn
him
over
to
the
iraqis.
does
he...
is
there
some
law
that
prevents
him
from
doing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
applies
to
the
sergeant
in
the
city
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
isn't
all
of
this
within
the
zone
of
military
discretion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
talking
about
a
transfer
in
what
i
assume
you
said
was
a
zone
of
hostilities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
a
transfer
in
an
area
that
you
say
was
engaged
in
active
hostilities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
affect
the
decision
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garre,
is
it
the
position
of
the
government
that
this
is
a
war
zone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
any
part
of
iraq
is
like
a
battlefield
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
it
a
war
zone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
means
you
haven't
made
your
strongest
argument.
