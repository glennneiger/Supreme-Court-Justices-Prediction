chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-1666,
and
the
consolidated
case
07-394,
munaf
versus
geren,
secretary
of
the
army,
and
geren
versus
omar.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
once
again
you're
relying
on
a
concurring
opinion
by
justice
douglas?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
suppose
if
he
were...
it
would
make
a
huge
difference
whether
such
an
individual
were
released
in
the
united
states
as
opposed
to
being
released
in
iraq.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
a
limit
to
your
proposition?
in
other
words,
let's
stipulate
that
the
individuals
are
going
to
be
released
in
a
situation
where
you
know
that
they
won't
receive
anything
resembling
due
process
and
will
be
subject
to
abuse.
what
happens
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
do
you
agree
that...
do
you
concede
that
habeas
is
concerned
with
the
safety
of
the
individual
as
opposed
to
his
custody?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
margulies?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
general
macarthur
have
effective
jurisdiction
and
control
in
japan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
a
habeas
court
here
has
to
look
at
all
those
different
factors
and
come
to
a
determination
of
whether
it
has
jurisdiction?
there's
no
bright
line?
it
has
to
look
at
whether
hostilities
have
ceased
or
haven't
ceased?
it's
got
to
look
at
how
far
the
prisoners
have
been
removed
from
the
zone
of
hostility?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
is
the
bright
line
that
determines
whether
there's
habeas
jurisdiction
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
control
in
the
middle
of
a
zone
of
hostilities
of
a
foreign
national
allows...
creates
habeas
jurisdiction?
that's
your
bright
line?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
it's
not
just
control.
it
looks
to
citizenship,
which
brings
up
the
questions
justice
stevens
was
raising.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that's
pretty
far
removed
from
the
bright
line.
i
mean,
now
you've
got
to
decide
whether
it's
in
the
zone
of
hostilities
or
not.
you've
got
to
decide
if
this
is
within
the
time
period
that
the
court
should
not
exercise
jurisdiction
or
not.
and
what's
going
to
happen,
of
course,
is
that
the
district
court
is
going
to
look
at
this
and
say,
i
can't
decide
all
of
that
right
away.
let's
enter
an
injunction,
a
preliminary
injunction
such
as
at
issue
here,
while
i
decide
these
questions.
and
that's
going
to
have
the
effect
of
intruding
quite
extensively
on
the
exercise
of
executive
authority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
me
try
and
move
you
to
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
had
thought
that
the
historic
purpose
of
the
great
writ
was
to
challenge
custody.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
last
thing
your
clients
want
in
this
case
is
to
be
released.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
want
the
district
court
to
say
you
win,
you
can
be
released
tomorrow
at
noon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
wanted
to
block
the
transfer.
i
mean,
the
iraqi
authorities
can
pick
him
up
at
the
gate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
relief
that
was
awarded
by
the
district
court
also
enjoined
prosecution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
want...
i'm
sorry.
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand.
you
want
the
relief
in
both
of
these
cases
to
be,
okay,
we
will
release
him
tomorrow
at
noon?
and
by
the
way,
we're
going
to
notify
the
iraqi
authorities
because
we
think
we're
releasing
a
dangerous
criminal
and
want
to
make
sure
they
have
the
opportunity
to
do
whatever
they
want?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
don't
tell--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
don't
tell
the
iraqis
where
that's
going
to
be?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
within
the
executive's
discretion.
i
want
to
know
if
you
are
saying
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
can
require
the
custodian
not
simply
to
release
the
person,
but
to
release
them
somewhere
else
and
to
keep
the
point
at
which
they're
going
to
release
someone
whose
been
determined
by
the
mnfi
tribunal
to
be
a
dangerous
criminal,
to
keep
the
point
of
his
release
secret
from
the
iraqi
government.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
now
the
determination
that
the
transfer
would
be
unlawful,
i...
again,
i
get
back...
maybe
i'm
repeating
myself.
i
have
always
understood
habeas
to
be
concerned
with
custody,
rather
than
this
broad
range
of
determinations
about
what's
lawful
and
unlawful,
other
than
as
are
necessary
to
rule
on
the
question
of
custody.
in
other
words,
of
course,
if
there's
been
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
you
bring
a
habeas
action,
you
determine
whether
the
custody
is
lawful
or
not.
here
you
want
a
determination
whether
the
transfer
is
unlawful
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
whether
it
does
or
does
not,
i
just
question
whether
habeas
is
an
appropriate
remedy
in
that
situation,
again
because
it's
not
concerned
with
the
legality
of
transfer;
it's
concerned
with
the
legality
of
custody.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
had
filed
it...
if
you
had
filed
it
six
months
rather
than
a
year
after,
would
there
be
habeas
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
see
where
i'm
going.
three
months?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
bright
line
is
getting
awfully
fuzzy,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
margulies,
let
me
make
sure
there
are
no
other
questions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
margulies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
garre,
seven
9
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
the
20,000-plus
people
being
retained,
are
they
all
in
connection
with
security
threats?
or
do
they
involve
what
i
guess
we
could
call
common
criminals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
06-1666,
munaf
versus
geren
and
the
consolidated
case
07-394,
geren
versus
omar.
these
cases
concerned
the
multinational
force-iraq
or
mnf-i.
the
mnf-i
is
an
international
coalition
force
composed
of
26
nations,
including
the
united
states.
it
operates
in
iraq
under
the
unified
command
of
u.s.
military
officers
at
the
iraqi
government's
request
and
in
accordance
with
united
nations
security
council
resolutions.
pursuant
to
the
u.
n.
mandate,
mnf-i
forces
engage
in
a
variety
of
military
and
humanitarian
activities,
including
the
detention
of
individuals
alleged
to
have
committed
hostile
or
war
like
acts
in
iraq,
pending
investigation
and
prosecution
in
iraqi
courts
under
iraqi
law.
shawqi
omar
and
mohammad
munaf,
the
habeas
petitioners
in
these
cases,
are
american
citizens
who
voluntarily
traveled
to
iraq
and
allegedly
committed
serious
crimes
there.
they
were
each
captured
by
military
forces
operating
as
part
of
the
mnf-i,
given
hearings
before
mnf-i
tribunals
composed
of
american
officers
who
concluded
that
they
pose
treats
to
iraq
security
and
placed
into
the
custody
of
the
u.s.
military
operating
as
part
of
the
mnf-i.
family
members
filed
next-friend
habeas
petitions
on
behalf
of
both
petitioners
in
the
united
states
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
in
omar's
case,
after
the
u.s.
department
of
justice
informed
omar
that
the
mnf-i
had
decided
to
refer
him
to
the
central
criminal
court
of
iraq
for
criminal
proceedings,
his
attorney
sought
and
obtained
a
preliminary
injunction
barring
omar's
removal
from
united
states
or
mnf-i
custody.
the
d.
c.
circuit
affirmed.
it
first
upheld
the
district
court's
exercise
of
habeas
jurisdiction,
finding
that
this
court's
1948
decision
in
hirota
versus
macarthur
did
not
preclude
review.
hirota
concerned
japanese
citizens
who
had
been
detained
in
japan
and
convicted
and
sentence
by
the
international
military
tribunal
for
the
far
east.
we
denied
those
japanese
citizens'
leave
to
file
habeas
petitions
in
united
states
courts.
the
d.
c.
circuit
distinguished
our
decision
in
that
case
on
the
grounds
that
omar
had
yet
to
be
convicted
by
a
foreign
tribunal.
meanwhile,
the
district
court
in
munaf's
case
dismissed
his
habeas
petition
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
court
read
our
decision
in
hirota
to
require
that
result
because
the
american
forces
holding
munaf
were
operating
as
part
of
an
international
force,
the
mnf-i.
it
agreed
with
the
district
court's
jurisdictional
holding
and
distinguished
its
prior
decision
in
omar
which
had
upheld
jurisdiction
over
omar's
habeas
petition
on
the
grounds
that
munaf
had
been
convicted
by
a
foreign
tribunal
while
omar
had
not.
we
granted
certiorari
in
these
consolidated
cases
to
decide
two
questions.
first,
whether
united
states
courts
had
jurisdiction
over
habeas
corpus
petitions
filed
on
behalf
of
american
citizens
challenging
their
detention
in
iraq
by
the
mnf-i.
second,
if
such
jurisdiction
exists,
may
district
courts
exercise
that
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
mnf-i
from
transferring
such
individuals
to
iraqi
custody
or
allowing
them
to
be
tried
before
iraqi
courts?
we
begin
with
the
jurisdictional
question.
the
government
acknowledges
that
the
habeas
petitioners
are
american
citizens
held
by
american
soldiers
who
answer
only
to
an
american
chain
of
command.
it,
nonetheless,
contends
that
the
federal
courts
lack
jurisdiction
over
the
detainees'
habeas
petitions
because
the
american
forces
holding
omar
and
munaf
operate
as
part
of
a
multinational
force.
they
are,
therefore,
held
pursuant
to
international
authority,
the
argument
goes,
"not
united
states'
authority
and
are
not
within
the
reach
of
the
habeas
statute".
in
support
of
its
argument,
the
government
naturally
points
to
our
decision
in
hirota
in
which
we
ruled
that
individual's
held
under
authority
of
a
multinational
force
could
not
seek
habeas
relief
in
united
states
courts.
we
reject
the
government's
jurisdictional
argument.
the
habeas
statute,
28
u.
s.
c.
section
2241(c)
provides
that
a
federal
district
court
may
entertain
a
habeas
application
by
a
person
held
"in
custody
under
or
by
color
of
the
authority
of
the
united
states".
the
disjunctive
“or”
in
the
statutory
language
i
just
read
makes
clear
that
actual
custody
by
the
united
states
suffices
for
jurisdiction
even
if
that
custody
could
be
viewed
as
under
the
color
of
another
authority
such
as
the
mnf-i.
now,
as
for
hirota,
that
slip
of
the
case,
only
nine
sentences
long,
differs
from
the
present
case
in
several
respects.
hirota
did
not
involved
united
states
citizens
and
the
government
asserted
that
the
detaining
authorities
in
that
case
were
not
subject
to
a
united
states
chain
of
command.
we
decline
to
extend
our
holding
in
hirota
to
preclude
american
citizens
held
overseas
by
american
soldiers
subject
to
an
american
chain
of
command
from
filing
habeas
petitions.
now,
in
one
of
the
cases
below,
omar,
the
district
court
granted
and
the
d.
c.
circuit
upheld
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
d.
c.
circuit
interpreted
the
injunction
to
prohibit
the
government
from
one,
transferring
omar
to
iraqi
custody,
two,
sharing
with
the
iraqi
government
details
concerning
any
decision
to
release
him,
and
three,
presenting
him
to
the
iraqi
courts
for
investigation
and
prosecution.
it
is
elementary
that
a
preliminary
injunction
is
an
extraordinary
and
drastic
remedy.
it
should
never
be
awarded
as
of
right
and
requires
that
the
party
seeking
an
injunction
demonstrate,
among
other
things,
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits.
but
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
d.
c.
circuit
considered
a
likelihood
of
success
as
to
the
merits
of
omar's
habeas
petition.
instead,
the
lower
courts
concluded
that
the
jurisdictional
issues
implicated
by
omar's
petition
were
difficult.
but
a
difficult
question
as
to
jurisdiction
is
no
reason
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction
which
requires
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits.
now,
what
we
have
said
thus
far
would
require
reversal
and
remand
in
each
of
these
cases.
the
lower
courts
in
munaf
erred
in
dismissing
for
want
of
jurisdiction
and
the
lower
courts
and
omar
erred
in
issuing
and
upholding
the
preliminary
injunction.
there
are
occasions,
however,
when
it
is
appropriate
for
a
court
reviewing
a
preliminary
injunction
to
proceed
to
the
merits.
given
that
the
present
cases
implicate
sensitive
foreign
policy
and
military
affairs
issues
in
the
context
of
ongoing
military
operations,
this
is
one
of
those
occasions.
the
habeas
petitioners
argue
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
two
reasons.
first,
they
contend
that
they
have
a
right
not
to
be
transferred
to
iraqi
authorities
for
criminal
proceedings.
second,
the
petitioners
argue
that
they
have
been
unlawfully
detained
by
the
united
states
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
with
respect
to
their
transfer
claim,
the
habeas
petitioners
request
an
injunction
prohibiting
the
united
states
from
transferring
them
to
iraqi
custody.
with
respect
to
their
unlawful
detention
claim,
they
request
release
but
only
to
the
extent
that
release
would
not
result
in
transfer
to
iraqi
custody.
the
unusual
nature
of
the
relief
sought
by
petitioners
suggests
that
habeas
is
not
appropriate
in
these
cases.
habeas
is
at
its
core,
a
remedy
for
unlawful
executive
detention
and
the
typical
remedy
is
release,
but
petitioners
do
not
want
simple
release
that
would
expose
them
to
--
to
--
apprehension
by
iraqi
authorities
for
criminal
prosecution,
precisely
what
they
went
the
federal
court
to
avoid.
petitioners
do
not
dispute
that
they
voluntarily
traveled
to
iraq,
that
they
remained
detained
within
the
sovereign
authority
of
iraq
today
or
that
they
are
alleged
to
have
committed
serious
crimes
in
iraq.
omar
and
munaf
both
concede
that
if
they
were
not
in
mnf-i
custody,
iraq
would
be
free
to
arrest
and
prosecute
them
under
iraqi
law.
indeed,
munaf
is
the
subject
of
ongoing
iraqi
criminal
proceedings
and
omar
would
be
but
for
the
present
injunction.
given
these
facts,
our
cases
make
clear
that
iraq
has
a
sovereign
right
to
prosecute
omar
and
munaf
for
crimes
committed
on
its
soil.
as
chief
justice
john
marshall
explained
nearly
two
centuries
ago,
"the
jurisdiction
of
the
nation
within
its
own
territory
is
necessarily
exclusive
and
absolute."
our
cases
explain
that
this
is
true
with
respect
to
american
citizens
who
travel
abroad
and
commit
crimes
in
another
nation,
whether
or
not
the
pertinent
criminal
process
comes
with
all
the
rights
guaranteed
by
our
constitution.
in
one
of
our
cases,
wilson
versus
girard,
for
example,
we
reversed
an
injunction
remarkably
similar
to
the
one
at
issue
here.
japan
charged
girard,
the
habeas
petitioner
in
that
case,
with
the
death
of
a
japanese
woman
in
japan.
and
after
girard
was
indicted,
but
while
he
still
remained
in
united
states'
custody,
he
filed
a
habeas
petition
in
federal
district
court
and
obtained
an
injunction
prohibiting
the
united
states
from
transferring
him
to
japanese
authorities.
we
granted
certiorari
and
vacated
the
injunction,
holding
that
the
habeas
court
could
not
enjoin
the
transfer
because
japan
had
an
exclusive
--
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
punish
offenses
against
its
laws
committed
within
its
boarders.
likewise,
in
another
case,
neely
versus
henkel,
we
held
that
habeas
corpus
was
not
available
to
defeat
the
criminal
jurisdiction
of
a
foreign
sovereign,
cuba
in
that
case,
even
when
application
of
that
sovereign's
law
would
allegedly
violate
our
constitution.
we
explained
that
an
american
citizen
who
commits
a
crime
in
a
foreign
country
"cannot
complain
if
required
to
submit
to
such
modes
of
trial
and
to
such
punishment
as
the
laws
of
that
country
may
prescribe
for
its
own
people".
we
are
all
familiar
with
the
expression,
"when
in
rome,
do
as
a
roman
would,"
a
corollary
is
that
when
in
rome,
you
are
subject
to
the
laws
of
rome.
in
the
present
cases,
omar
and
munaf
concede
that
iraq
has
a
sovereign
right
to
prosecute
them
for
alleged
violations
of
its
law
if
they
went
to
federal
court
seeking
an
order
that
would
allow
them
to
defeat
precisely
what
sovereign
authority.
the
foregoing
cases
i
have
discussed
make
clear
that
habeas
corpus
does
not
bar
the
united
states
from
transferring
a
prisoner
to
the
sovereign
authority
with
the
undoubted
right
to
prosecute
him.
petitioners'
so-called
release
claim
adds
nothing
to
their
--
to
their
transfer
claim
and
fails
for
the
same
reasons
given
that
the
release
they
seek
is
only
released
that
would
avoid
transfer.
there
is,
of
course,
even
more
to
the
issue
here.
the
neely
case,
i
talked
about,
involved
a
charge
of
embezzlement,
and
the
wilson
case
involved
the
peacetime
actions
of
a
serviceman.
the
present
cases
concern
individuals
captured
and
detained
within
an
ally's
territory
during
ongoing
hostilities
involving
our
troops.
it
would
be
very
odd
to
hold
that
the
executive
can
transfer
individuals
such
as
those
in
the
neely
and
wilson
cases,
but
cannot
transfer
to
an
ally
detainees
captured
by
our
armed
forces
for
engaging
in
serious
hostile
acts
against
that
ally
in
what
the
government
refers
to
as
“an
active
theater
of
combat".
the
habeas
petitioners
contend
that
these
general
principles
are
trumped
in
their
cases
because
their
transferred
to
iraqi
custody
is
likely
to
result
in
torture.
petitioners'
allegations
are
a
matter
of
serious
concern,
but
our
cases
have
long
recognized
that
such
allegations
generally
must
be
addressed
by
the
political
branches
not
the
judiciary.
as
chief
justice
john
marshall
long
ago
explained,
"exemptions
from
territorial
jurisdiction
are
questions
of
policy,
not
law,
and
they
are
the
subject
for
diplomacy,
not
legal
discussion".
in
the
present
cases,
the
government
explains
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
united
states
not
to
transfer
an
individual
in
circumstances
where
torture
is
likely
to
result
and
that
the
state
department
has
determined
that
the
justice
ministry,
the
department
which
has
authority
over
munaf
and
omar
as
well
as
its
prison
and
detention
facilities,
have
generally
met
internationally
accepted
standards
for
basic
prisoner
needs.
for
all
these
reasons,
petitioners
state
no
claim
in
their
habeas
petitions
for
which
relief
may
be
granted.
and
those
petitions
should
have
been
promptly
dismissed.
the
judgments
below
and
the
injunction
entered
at
the
--
against
the
united
states
are
vacated
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
