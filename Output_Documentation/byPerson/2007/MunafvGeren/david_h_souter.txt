justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
problem
with
the
argument
that
hirota
did
not
at
any
point
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
saying...
say,
we're
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
we
come
to
of
no
jurisdiction
because
there's
an
international
force?
i
mean,
hirota
said,
you
know,
there's
this,
that,
and
the
other
thing,
and
under
all
these
circumstances
we
don't
think
there's
jurisdiction.
well,
one
of
the
things
that's
different
here
is
you
had
japanese
soldiers
in
hirota
and
you've
got
american
citizens
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
is,
there's
something...
the
implication
of
that
i
think
is
what
is
bothersome,
because
in
effect
it
means,
if
that
rule
is
applied
to
this
case,
it
means
that
the
president
acting
alone
can
make
an
agreement
for
an
international
force
or
a
cooperative
force
and
that
agreement
of
the
executive
alone
in
effect
eliminates
habeas
jurisdiction
over
an
american
citizen.
and
that
obviously
is
in
tension,
if
not
inconsistent,
with
the
suspension
clause
and
it's
a
little
scary.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
real
world
terms
isn't
it
the
case
that
they
are
under
united
states
authority?
you've
got
an
american
commander,
you've
straight-line
authority
right
through,
and...
and
one
knows...
to
be
realistic,
one
knows
perfectly
well
that
if
any
order
were
given
to
the
american
military
involved,
they
would
not
hand
them
over,
i.e.,
they
would
obey
the
order,
international...
agreement
for
international
cooperation
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think...
i
think
you're
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
be...
i
mean,
hirota
was
a
literally,
i
think,
a
two
or
three-day
per
curiam
opinion.
it
occupied
less
than
a
page,
and
it
had
this
kind
of
whole
ball
of
wax
sort
of
reasoning
involved
in
it.
and
as
precedential
authority,
if
this
case
turned
on
the
question
of
whether
we
look
to
the
theory
of
international
authority
rather
than,
i
think,
the
realistic
fact
of
american
domination,
i
don't
think
hirota
is
a
very
strong
precedent
against
our
at
least
taking
the
realistic
view
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that...
doesn't
that
issue
that
you
raise
at
least
deserve
litigation
before
the
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
shouldn't
they?
i
mean,
if
a...
if
a
court
may
consider
the
imminence
of
lynch-mob
action
either
sanctioned
by
the
requesting
government
or
tolerated
by
it,
why
cannot
the
same
point
be
made
about
a
claim
of
torture
if
there
is
at
least
enough
color
in
the
claim
to
say
there's
something
to
inquire
into?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
have...
why
isn't
your
answer
different
in
the
lynch-mob
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
once
they're
turned
over
to
the
prison
authorities
they're
in
the
situation
that
the
ngo
brief
describes.
i
mean,
that's
it
seems
to
me
ultimately
what
the
concern
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
guess
that
just
gets
me
back
to
my
earlier
question.
isn't
that
something
that
ought
to
be
explored
as
an
evidentiary
matter
in
determining
whether
there
should
be
a
permanent
injunction?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
answering
that
question,
would
you
go
back,
please,
and
clarify
something
that
i'm
not
too
clear
on
in
your
answers
to
comparable
questions
from
justice
kennedy
and
justice
stevens?
and
that
is,
you
say
we
do
not
claim
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction
within
the
zone
of
hostilities.
is
it
your
point...
and
you
then
go
on
to
say,
well,
they've
been
moved
to
this
camp.
is
your
point
the
simple
point
that
the
camp
gets
them
out
of
the
zone
of
hostilities?
and
is
that
the
reason
that
you
answered
justice
breyer's
question
by
saying
this
is
comparable
to
an
occupation
rather
than
a
war
zone?
is
that
the
simple
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
within
what
is
technically
a
zone
of
hostility,
there
are
places,
physical
places,
i
take
it,
within
which
the
military
has
a
degree
of
discretion;
and
that
discretion
is
what
makes
this
situation
comparable
to
an
occupation?
i
mean,
i'm
just
not
following
how
you're
getting
from
a
to
b.
that's...
that's
my
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you've
got
to
say
that
there
is
habeas
jurisdiction
within
the
zone
of
hostility.
i
thought
you
said
the
opposite.
justice
david
h.
souter
an
abstention
kind
of
doctrine
then
is
what
you
are
getting
at?
justice
david
h.
souter
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
right.
let's
get
to
that.
what
manner?
tell
me
exactly
what
should
such
an
order
would
look
like.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
releasing
at
place
a,
not
place
b.
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
push
him
out
the
gates;
take
him
somewhere
else,
and
then
release
him.
that's
the
order?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
garre,
would
you
address
this
question
at
some
point?
assuming...
assume
an
officer
in
the
national
government
arrests
somebody
unlawfully
in
portland,
oregon,
and
transfers
the
person
across
the
country
to
portland,
maine.
the
person
files
for
habeas
in
the
district
court
in
maine,
and
the
district
court
says:
yes,
you
are
right.
you
are
being
held
unlawfully.
does
the
court
have
the
authority
to
tell
the
united
states
to
take
him
back
to
portland,
oregon,
and
then
release
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
have
a
position
on
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
habeas
court
says,
look,
it
is
not
complete
relief
just
to
put
him
out
on
the
street
in
portland...
in
maine.
he's
broke,
and
he's
3,000
miles
from
home.
take
him
back
to
portland,
oregon.
does
the
habeas
court
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
it
means
the
same
thing
that
the
point
of
my
question
was.
he
is
saying
you
can't
release
him
at
point
a,
which
would
be
tantamount
to
transfer;
you've
got
to
take
him
to
point
b,
somewhere
where
his
release
will
not
result
in
the
automatic
arrest.
and
that's
why
i
asked
my
question.
