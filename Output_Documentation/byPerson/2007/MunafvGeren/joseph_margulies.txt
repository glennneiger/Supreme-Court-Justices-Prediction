mr.
joseph
margulies
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
resolve
any
confusion
about
the
habeas
petitioners'
claims,
i'd
like
to
focus
on
two
points
this
morning.
the
first
is
we
believe
the
jurisdictional
question
is
governed
by
the
following
rule:
when
a
united
states
citizen
is
detained
abroad
by
united
states
military
officials
who
have
effective
authority
and
control
over
his
continued
detention,
as
mr.
garre
concedes
is
the
case
today,
the
united
states
district
court
has
jurisdiction
over
that
citizen's
habeas
petition.
mr.
joseph
margulies
frankly,
your
honor,
the
record
in
that
regard
is
unclear.
as
we
point
out
in
our,
brief,
solicitor
general
pearlman
argued
precisely
the
opposite.
but
let
us
concede
for
the
moment
that
he
would,
that
justice
douglas
had
the
better
of
that
position,
which
the
court
in
hirota
did
not
resolve.
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
it
is
irrelevant
to
this
question,
because
the
problems
that
doomed
the
habeas
applications
in
hirota
had
nothing
to
do
with
macarthur's
status
in
the
chain
of
command.
the
problems
with
hirota
were
these:
nothing
in
general
macarthur's
status
as
an
american
officer
would
have
transformed
those
petitioners
from
enemy
aliens
to
american
citizens.
nothing
in
general
macarthur's
status
would
have
transformed
their
complaint
as
something
other
than
an
attack
on
the
judgment
and
sentences
of
an
international
tribunal
imposed
upon
them.
that,
in
fact,
is
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
its
nine
sentences
in
hirota,
that
it
was
an
attack
on
the
judgment
and
sentences
imposed
upon
them
by
an
international
tribunal.
and
lastly,
vis
a
vis
the
narrow
question
before
the
court
in
hirota,
nothing
in
general
macarthur's
status
would
have
made
this
anything
other
than
an
improper
attempt
to
invoke
the
original
and
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
mr.
joseph
margulies
it
is
a
sufficient
ground,
your
honor,
but
it
does
not--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--we
believe
there
would
be
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
but
no
basis
to
proceed--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--only
vis
a
vis
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
but
i
would
stress
we
disagree
very
vigorously
with
mister...
with
the
government
that
if
jurisdiction
were
to
extend
here
to
foreign
nationals,
a
position
on
which
we
take
no
issue...
that
it
would
be--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--frankly,
your
honor,
we
are
inclined
to
agree
with
justice
scalia's
position
in...
my
interpretation
of
the
habeas
statute
accords
with
justice
scalia's
view
of
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
giving
a
right
to
citizens--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--no,
your
honor.
and
as
i
say,
what
we
know
from...
certainly
with
made
explicit
in
eisentrager,
where
the
court
described
citizenship
as
a
head
of
jurisdiction
and
then
reaffirmed
for
people
detained
abroad,
some
detained
pursuant
to
international
authority,
like
toth
v.
quarles,
burns
v.
wilson,
wilson
v.
girard,
ex
parte
hayes,
gualiardo--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--no,
your
honor.
and
one
of
the
worrisome
positions--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--we
think
that
that
question
is
answered
in
hamdi,
your
honor.
we
do
not
challenge
the
zone
of
military
discretion
that
exists
at
the
moment
of
capture.
mr.
joseph
margulies
oh,
no,
we
do
accept
that
it
exists
in
iraq
today,
your
honor.
and
we
are
not
challenging...
your
honor,
in
this
case
we
did
not
file
the
habeas
petition
until
mr.
omar
had
been
in
custody
for...
in
united
states
custody,
for
more
than
a
year.
we
did
not
file
in
munaf
until
mr.
munaf
had
been
in
united
states
custody
for
more
than
a
year.
mr.
joseph
margulies
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes,
your
honor.
the
united
states
has
made
the
decision
to
retain
these
people...
they
have
moved
them
around
within
iraq,
but
they
have
made
the
decision
to
keep
them
in
iraq.
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor,
we
accept
that
there
are
violent
ongoing
hostilities
in
iraq,
but
the
united
states
government
takes
the
position
that
the
geneva
conventions,
with
which
they
are
complying
here...
in
this
case
the
conflict
is
governed
by
geneva
convention
4...
obligates
the
united
states
to
move
prisoners
to
a
safe
location,
and
they
have
done
that
by
taking
these
prisoners
to
camp
cropper.
i
have
been
to
camp
cropper
and
i
agree
with
the
united
states
that
they
are
complying
with
the
geneva
conventions
in
that
regard.
and
upon
moving
the
petitioners
to
camp
cropper,
at
that
moment
the
case
becomes
functionally
litigable
just
as
hamdi
would
have
been.
that
is,
the
government
will
assemble
its
proof
to
defend
the
detentions
and
present
it
in
a
district
court.
the
only
difference
is
that
mr.
munaf
and
mr.
omar
won't
appear
personally.
mr.
joseph
margulies
oh,
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
extraordinarily
relevant,
and
i
think
that
we
are
entitled--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--no,
your
honor.
i
apologize
if
i
misspoke.
we
are
basing
it
on
citizenship--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--but
it
is
only
one
of
the
grounds
upon
which
we
would
distinguish
this
case
from
hirota.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
frankly,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
the
united
states
makes
that
instruction
to
its
uniformed
officers.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor,
there
are
important
reasons
embedded
in
the
laws
of
war
that
authorize
the
united
states
in
this
context
to
transfer
foreign
nationals
back...
in
this
case
the
overwhelming
number
of
which
are
iraqis...
back
to
the
custody
of
the
iraqi
government,
that
the
laws
of
war
do
not
allow
for...
with
u.s.
citizens.
that
is
a
distinction.
mr.
joseph
margulies
i
take
no
position
on
whether
it's
extravagant,
your
honor,
but
i
certainly
take
the
position
that
that's
not
what
we
argue.
and
there
are
grounds...
there
are
grounds
predicated
on
the
laws
of
war,
on
the
terms
of
the
extradition
treaty,
on
the
possible
application
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
simply
make
differentiation
between
citizens
and
non-citizens.
mr.
joseph
margulies
control.
that
is
what
habeas
turns
on,
your
honor.
and
the
bright-line
test
that
we
propose,
which
is
the
one
that
has
been
followed
by
this
court--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
what
i
mean
to
suggest,
the
rule
that
i
propose...
the
rule
that
i
propose
is
that
when
a
u.s.
citizen
is
detained
abroad
by
u.s.
military
officials
who
have
effective
authority
and
control
over
his
continued
detention,
that
citizen
can
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
apologize.
what
i
said
at
the
outset
is
that
this
is
a
test
which
turns
on
the
jurisdictional
facts
that
i
have
identified,
which
is
when
a
citizen
is
detained
by
the
u.s.
military
abroad
and
the
military
has
effective
control.
mr.
joseph
margulies
toth
v.
quarles,
of
course,
your
honor,
involved
a
person
who
was
brought
from
the
united
states
to
korea
when
there
was
still
hostilities
ongoing.
but
your
honor,
again
i
would
suggest
that
what
the
court
will
have
to
inquire
into
has
been
addressed
already
by
hamdi,
because
we
will
not
look
at
the
period
of
time--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
but
we
are
not
focusing
on
the
moment
of
capture.
the
united
states
already
has--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--not
quite,
your
honor.
our
position
is...
and
i
want
to
come
back--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--for
several
reasons,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
as
the
court
knows,
the
habeas
statute
itself
has
been
amended
in
a
way
that
excludes
access
for
foreign
nationals
outside
the
country.
the
court...
or
rather
congress,
very
carefully
did
not
exclude
it
for
u.s.
citizens.
second,
there
may
be
limitations
on
whether
foreign
nationals
can
invoke
the
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment.
third,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
extradition
treaty
bars
the
transfer
of
citizens,
but
does
not
bar
the
transfer
of
non-citizens.
and
fourth,
the
laws
of
war
allow
the
united
states
to
transfer
iraqis,
but
contemplate
the
continued
application
of
extradition
principles
that
were
in
place
prior
to
the
start
of
the
conflict.
so
there
are
four
brakes,
if
you
will,
on
the
slippery
slope.
there
is
no
floodgates
problem
in
this
case.
so
far
as
we
are
aware--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--you
should
definitely
not
assimilate
this
case
to
the
latter
category,
your
honor.
that
is
not
what
this
case
is
about.
and
let
me
turn
then--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--no,
your
honor.
what
i
am...
what
i
am
seizing
upon
is
the
conclusion
in
hamdi
that
there
is
a
zone
of
military
discretion
within
which
the
judiciary
ought
not
intrude.
and
that
has
both
spatial
and
temporal
qualities.
this
is
a
person
who
has
been
moved
from
that
place,
and
the
detention
has
been
made,
a
decision
has
been
made
to
continue
detention
long
after--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--your
honor,
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
we
recognize
that
there
are
hostilities
going
on
inside
iraq.
but
the
united
states
has
made
a
decision
to
move
the
person,
as
required
by
the
geneva
conventions,
to
a
safe
location.
mr.
joseph
margulies
absolutely.
that
is--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
margulies
we
would
not,
your
honor.
we
would
not
have
a
different
result
either
jurisdictionally
or
on
the
merits.
if
the
united
states
government
has
custody
and
control
of
a
united
states
citizen,
there
is
habeas
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
margulies
no,
your
honor.
i
do
say...
our
position
is
that
the
habeas
statute
would
give
jurisdiction,
but
there
may
be
a
period
in
which
it
would
be
inappropriate,
unwise,
just
as
in
hamdi,
for
the
court
to
intrude.
and
that
may
be--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--yes.
it
is
abstention
upon--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--i...
we
think
not,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
it
does
not
alter
in
the
slightest
the
jurisdictional
rule.
the
jurisdictional
rule
given
to
us
by
the
habeas
statute
is
still
a
bright-line
rule.
there
may
be
some
cases
where
the
petitioner
is
asking
to...
the
court
to
inquire
into
the
lawfulness
of...
the
two
inquiries
in
this
case,
the...
both
of
them
governed
by
the
due
process
clause...
the
lawfulness
of
the
detention
for
security
threats,
and
the
lawfulness
of
the
proposed
transfer.
those
are
two
different
inquiries.
those
are
the
two
inquiries.
there
may
be
some
instance
where
that
request
is
made
fairly
shortly
after
the
decision
was
made
to
continue
to
detain.
mr.
joseph
margulies
no.
mr.
joseph
margulies
we
do
not.
it
is
emphatically
not
the
case.
the
resolutions
which
bring
the
multinational
force
into
existence
say
that
it
will
operate
under
the
unified
command
of
the
united
states
military,
which
is
precisely
the
position
that
the
government
pressed
in
its
brief,
on
page
2
of
its
brief.
general
casey
when
he
testified
said
that
the
mnf
is
a
subordinate
command
to
the
united
states
military.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
suggests
that
the
mnf
could,
if
it
wanted
to,
give
an
order
that
the
united
states
could
not
countermand.
there
is
nothing
that
gives
this
anything
other
than...
and
we
do
not...
we
do
not
denigrate
or
diminish
the
significance
of
any
other
country's
participation.
but
the
buck
stops
with
the
united
states
government
when
it
comes
to
these
detentions.
mr.
joseph
margulies
please.
mr.
joseph
margulies
that
is
incorrect,
your
honor,
and
let
me
make
it
clear.
there
is
some
question
that
emerged
in
the
earlier
argument
on
the
potential
equivalence
between
release
and
transfer.
so
let
me
address
that
directly.
with
respect
to
transfer...
again
that's
a
separate
question
from
detention
simpliciter...
with
respect
to
transfer,
there
are
two
questions:
the
transfer
will
either
be
lawful
or
it
will
not;
iraq
will
either
want
him
or
it
will
not.
that
obviously
produces
four
different
possible
outcomes,
a
matrix
with
four
boxes.
it
is
too
early
to
ascertain
which
of
those
boxes
we
will
be
in,
but
let
me
give
an
illustration.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes,
we
do.
in
fact,
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--your
honor,
let's
say
we
had...
my
understanding
of
the
evidence
in
munaf
leads
me
to
believe
that
on
remand
this
is
where
we...
this
is
where
the
state
of
play
will
go:
the
transfer
will
be
unlawful,
and
the
iraqi
government
will
not
want
him.
transfer
unlawful.
iraqi
government
won't
want
him.
he
can
be
released
to
his
home--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--correct.
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor,
his
petition,
like
mr.
omar's
petition,
seeks
his
release.
the
only
complexity
arises
in
one
of
the
possible
boxes;
that
is,
the
court
concludes
that
the
transfer
is
unlawful,
but
there
is
no...
but
the
iraqi
government
wants
him.
the
transfer
is
unlawful,
but
the
iraqi
government
wants
him.
in
that
situation,
in
order
to
give
effect
to
the
legal
conclusion
that
the
transfer
is
unlawful--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor,
you
are
correct
that
we
do
not
object
to
the
idea
that,
while
the
district
court
is
determining
whether
it
is
lawful
to
detain
a
u.s.
citizen
in
this
circumstances
or
transfer
a
u.s.
citizen
in
those
circumstances...
those
two
inquiries...
it
is
okay
to
detain
mr.
munaf
for
the
benefit
of
the
iraqi
government.
mr.
joseph
margulies
it
does
not,
your
honor,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
d.c.
circuit
in
omar
interprets
that,
we
do
not...
we
disavow
that.
there...
as
the
court
pointed
out,
the...
first
of
all,
they
can
try
a
prisoner
in
absentia.
all
we
object
to
is
that...
a
physical
transfer
of
mr.
omar
or
mr.
munaf,
while
the
lawfulness
of
that
transfer
is
being
determined.
and
that
is
all
we
sought.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
there
is...
there
is
no
question
that
we
do
not
challenge
any
right
of
sovereignance
in
iraq
to
share
information.
the
only
circumstance
in
which
it
potentially
arises
is
one
in
which
release
has
the
effect
of
being
transfer
and
there
is
a
prior
determination
by
a
united
states
district
court
that
the
transfer
would
be
unlawful.
so
that--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--because
what
i
understood
the
hypothetical
to
mean
is
that
there
had
not
been
a
prior
determination
that
the
transfer
would
be
unlawful.
in
other
words,
if
they
just
released
him
tomorrow...
they
said,
we
have
lost
interest
in
him;
we're
releasing
him
tomorrow...
there
is
no
prior
determination
that
the
transfer
is
unlawful.
mr.
joseph
margulies
so
you're
not--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
no.
your
honor,
if
the
conclusion
is
that
the
transfer
would
be
unlawful,
then
you
cannot
release
him
in
a
way
that
effects
the
transfer.
mr.
joseph
margulies
because,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
district
court
can
order,
under
28
u.s.c.
2243,
as
law
and
justice
requires,
a
release...
or
rather,
relief
that
gives
effect
to
the
contours
of
the
right.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes,
you
can.
but
if
there
is
a
determination
that
the
transfer
would
be
unlawful,
then
you
need
to
release
the
person
in
a
manner...
for
instance,
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--it...
we
would
ask
the
district
court
to
order
precisely
what
the
military
already
does,
which
is
to
remove
a
person
to
a
safe
place.
when
united
states
citizens
are
released
from
camp
cropper,
they
are
brought
from--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
that's
the--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--they
don't
do
that
now,
your
honor.
when...
when
united
states
citizens
are
released
from
iraq,
what
they
do
is
they
put
them
in
a
car
out
of
camp
cropper,
the
same
thing
when
i
left
camp
cropper.
they
put
them
in
a
car
from
camp
cropper.
they
drive
them
to
the
american--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--if
the
determination
has
already
been
made
that
the
transfer
would
be
unlawful,
yes,
we
think
that
in
law
and
equity
they
can
do
that.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
because
the
united
states
government
simply
lacks
the
power
under
the
due
process
clause
to
surrender
a
citizen
to
the
custody
of
another
sovereign.
that...
it
just
lacks
that
power.
mr.
joseph
margulies
habeas
has
long
been
used
to
test
the
lawfulness,
under
the
fifth
amendment,
of
a
proposed
transfer.
mr.
joseph
margulies
it...
once
the
united
states
has
the
authority
to--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--it
may
be
the
constitution
and
the
habeas
statute
could
combine
to
prevent
that.
mr.
joseph
margulies
as
i
said
before,
your
honor...
as
i
tried
to
say,
and
i
apologize
if
i'm
not
being
clear...
there
is
a
zone
of
military
discretion
where
it
may
not
be
appropriate--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--because
we
filed
this
application
more
than
a
year
after
the
united
states
made
a
decision
to
continue
the
detention.
think
about
it
this
way,
your
honor:
if
hamdi...
exact
same
facts...
had
simply
been
kept
in
afghanistan,
instead
of
brought
to
charleston,
south
carolina,
we
think
there
still
would
have
habeas
jurisdiction.
the
court
would
have
undertaken
the
exact
same
inquiry.
mr.
joseph
margulies
we
think
in
six
months,
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
there
may
be
some
cases
that
become
difficult,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
for
instance--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--your
honor,
in
this
case...
in
both
cases,
after
two
months
they
made
the
determination
to
continue
to
hold
them
in
the
mnfi
tribunals.
so
at
the
very
least,
at
that
point
we're
covered.
mr.
joseph
margulies
yes.
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
it
has
been
the
law
for
over
a
century
in
this
country.
it
ordinarily
arises
in
the
classic
extradition
context.
but
even
when
a
person
is
already
overseas
and
the
united
states
wants
to
transfer
them
to
the
custody
of
another
sovereign--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor,
we--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--it
does
not
affect
a
citizen's
due-process
entitlement.
in
the
metes
and
bounds,
the
way
we
would
analyze
it
under
matthews
versus
aldridge,
it
may
affect
what
inquiry
the
government
has
to
make
in
order
to
justify
it.
but
it
does
not
affect
the
citizen's
right,
the
citizen's
constitutional
entitlement,
to
challenge
the
lawfulness
of
a
transfer
at
the
hands
of
his
government
to
another
sovereign.
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor,
just
to
finish
the
answer,
the
transfer
may
take
place,
but
it
may
only
take
place
as
authorized
by
law.
that
is,
they
have
to
show
a
legal
and
factual
basis.
the
legal
basis
is
they
have
to
show
a
treaty
or
a
statutory
authority;
and
the
factual
basis
is
they
have
to
show
that
the
person
comes
within
it.
so,
of
course,
they
can
pass
a
person.
those...
those
transfers
take
place
all
the
time,
but
it
must
take
place
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
the
law.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
margulies
correct.
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor,
we...
all
of
these
other
matters
we
do
not
need
in
order
to
prevail.
the
district
court,
examining
two
claims
under
the
due-process
clause,
will
examine
whether
there
is
legal
authority
to
detain
a
person,
to
detain
these
prisoners
as
security
internees
or
security
threats.
that
is
a
classic
hamdi
inquiry.
and
they
will
examine
under
the
due-process
clause
whether
it
is
lawful
to
transfer
them.
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor,
this
is
what
came
up
in
hamdi.
in
hamdi,
you
had
a
conflict,
boots
on
the
ground.
they
captured
a
united
states
citizen
in
a
battlefield
situation.
and
this
court
made
a
decision,
made
a
determination,
that
that
person
can
challenge
the
lawfulness
of
his...
of
his
detention.
mr.
joseph
margulies
your
honor,
we
think
that
point
is
answered
by
the
suggestion
in
hamdi
that
you
don't
want
to
create
a
perverse
incentive
to
keep
people
there.
they
have
made
a
decision
to
keep
them
there.
the
inquiry
that
the
district
court
will
undertake
is
the
same
in
hamdi
as
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
that...
there
is
nothing
about
that
inquiry
that
is
altered
by
the
united
states'
determination
to
move
them
to
a
safe--
mr.
joseph
margulies
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
what
the
district
court
did
in
its
preliminary
injunction,
the
rosetta
stone
of
the
preliminary
injunction
appears
on
page
143
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
there
you
have
an
e-mail
from
the
united
states
government,
from
opposing
counsel
to
us,
indicating
to
us
on
february
2,
2006,
that
a
decision
had
been
made
to
refer
mr.
omar
to
proceedings
in
the
ccci,
but
telling
us
in
the
second-to-the-last
sentence
of
that
page
that
we
would
not
receive
notice
of
when
that
referral
took
place.
and
it
pointedly...
they
did
not
say
that
mr.
omar
would
remain
in
u.s.
custody
once
the
referral
took
place.
mr.
joseph
margulies
thank
you,
your
honor.
