mr.
scott
d.
makar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
virtues
of
reading
congress'
grant
of
the
stamp
tax
exemption,
1146(c),
to
only
post-confirmation
transfers
is
threefold.
first,
it's
faithful
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
requires
that
there
be
a
plan
confirmed,
as
the
courts
in
nvr
and
hechinger
have
held,
and
draws
a
simple
bright-line
test
at
the
point
of
confirmation,
at
which
point
the
bankruptcy
judge
has
the
power
to
grant
that
tax
exemption.
it's
also
based
upon
the
principle
that
taxation
exemption
statutes,
which
this
is
a
case
involving
one,
must
be
narrowly
construed
if
they
are
to
stay
under
principles
of
federalism.
it
also
avoids
the
intrusion
into
the
state's
tax
system,
keeping
in
mind
the
important
fact
that
approximately
three-quarters
of
these
chapter
11
cases
never
get
to
plan
confirmation.
instead,
in
three
quarters
of
the
cases
you
have,
as
in
lamie
and
in
the
hartford
case,
you
may
have
a
case
convert
to
chapter
7
or
have
it
be
dismissed.
so
a
pre-confirmation
tax
exemption
granted
by
the
bankruptcy
judge
at
any
point
prior
to
confirmation--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
justice
breyer,
what
happens
in
these
situations
is
that
a...
for
example,
a
363
sale
order
where
the
property
is
being
sold,
in
that
order
there
is
an
exemption
granted
by
the
bankruptcy
judge.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
that's
our
point
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
what
happens
in
these
situations
before
confirmation
where
there
is
a
363
order
that
transfers,
that
the
bankruptcy
court
then
says
this
is
entitled
to
an
exemption,
at
that
point
in
time
the
state
of
florida
or
whatever
state
is
denied
the
revenue
that
would
otherwise--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
two
things,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
the
bankruptcy
code
speak
in
terms
of
a...
1146(c)
speaks
in
terms
of
a
"plan
confirmed".
mr.
scott
d.
makar
sure.
in
this
context--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
practical
reason
is
congress
has
created
a
structured
bankruptcy
code,
in
which
there
is
a
plan
confirmation
process
structure
that
congress
has
provided
here.
and
in
this
particular
case,
and
in
perhaps
the
hypothetical,
this
was
done
outside
the
plan
confirmation
process.
in
other
words,
this
sale
was
done
even
before
a
plan
was
even
filed.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
that's
the
fundamental
problem
we
have.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
there
certainly
is.
there
has
to
be
a
filing
for--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
sure,
but
here
what
we
have
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
1146(c),
is
keyed
in
to
a
key
event,
which
is
plan
confirmation,
the
plan
confirmed.
the
authority
for
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
grant
the
tax--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
that
has...
i
don't
see
that
as
having
any
relevance
as
to
the
authority
of
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
grant
the
tax
exemption.
the
question
i
understood
was
how
far
back
can
can
you
go?
and
our
position
on
that
is
opening
this
up
to
pre-confirmation
transfers
creates
all
sorts
of
problems.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
no.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
as
i
understand
the
question,
justice
breyer,
you're
concerned
about
the
pre-confirmation
transfer
that
ultimately
gets
wrapped
into
a
plan
that's
ultimately
confirmed
and
why
shouldn't
that
be
occurring?
our
position--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--right.
and
that's
the
language
of
the
statute
in
our
view
provides
that
the
authority
flows
from
the
confirmed
plan.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
no,
in
fact--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no,
that's
exactly
our
argument.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
that's
our
argument,
which
is
that
it
is...
is
not
narrowly
construing
the
statute.
it's
broadly
construing
it,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
found--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--right.
this
appears
to
be
one
of
those
so-called
pre-packaged
plans
where
it
was
arranged
and
was
sort
of
put
together
outside
a
formal
plan
confirmation
process.
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
typically
there's
the
filing
of
the
petition--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--and
filing
of
the
plan--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--that's
precisely
my
point.
in
three-quarters
of
these
cases
approximately,
these
exemptions
can
be
given.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
possibly.
if
it's
in
escrow,
possibly.
it
takes
a
tremendous
amount
of
monitoring
in
these
cases.
there's
a
problem
with
notice.
the
state
doesn't
get
notice.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
yes.
i
mean,
that
could
be
a
possibility.
that's
our
position,
that
this
is
sort
of
turning
this
into
a
refund
statute,
perhaps
in
some
instances,
by
allowing
all
these
pre-confirmation
transfers
to
be
eligible
for
the
exemption,
keeping
in
mind
that
this
whole
question
in
this
case
is:
are
preconfirmation
transfers
ever
eligible?
we
don't
think
they...
that
they
are
because,
as
the
courts
in
nvr
and
hechinger
said,
the
natural,
simple,
bright-line
test
is
if
you
get
to
plan
confirmation,
if
you've
gone
through
the
process
that
congress
has
established,
and
you
get
a
plan
confirmed,
then
the
transfer
of
the
security...
this
is
not
a
securities
case...
but
the
transfer
of
the
property
has
at
that
point
been
exempt
from
the
tax.
so
in
our
view,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
would
be
thwarted
by
allowing
all
these
pre-confirmation
exemptions.
as
i
say,
in
25
percent
of
the
cases
perhaps
you
will
get
the
plan
confirmed,
and
perhaps--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--work
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no.
i
think
we
have
to
put
this
in
context.
what
we
have
is
a
chapter
11
reorganization.
and
then
chapter
7
of
course
is
liquidation,
which
is
typically
where
the
assets
of
the
company
would
be
liquidated
and
sold
off,
and
you
have
a
trustee.
here
we
have
a
different
context.
this
reorganization...
congress
established
this
reorganization
process.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
there
are
a
number.
and
i'm
not
sure
exactly
the
number,
but
it's
a
small
but
growing
percentage
in
which
the
debtors
are
taking
advantage
of
chapter
11
to
liquidate
rather
than
go
through
chapter
7.
and
there's
reasons
for
that.
it
may
be
that
the
debtor
in
possession
of
the
company
has
greater
control
than
a
trustee
would
and
so
forth.
our
point
is
that
this
is...
in
this
liquidation
context,
it's
basically
trying
to
hammer
a
chapter
7
peg
into
a
chapter
11
hole,
because
what
is
happening
here
is
the
tax
exemption
that
congress
has
set
up
here,
which
should
be
narrowly
construed
in
favor
of
the
state,
is
being
broadly
expanded.
in
fact,
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did
below--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
the
harm,
justice
scalia,
is
that
in
these
instances...
as
i
said,
in
cases
where
he
exemption
is
being
granted
unjustifiably,
the
state
has
to
expend
resources
on
litigation.
and
there
is
now
a
new
test,
and
there
has...
it
is
going
back
to
court,
and
there
is--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--the
notice
provision
is
one.
the
state
may
not
get
notice.
for
example
in
nvr,
there's
5,000-and-something
transfers
of
property
that
happened
in
the
state
of
florida
that
we
never
get
notice
of
to
object
to
them.
if
it
is
in
a
363
context,
we
probably
don't
get
notice
because
we
don't
own
the
property
that
is
being
transferred.
all
this
pre-confirmation
effort
and
expenditure
of
resources
on...
the
state
has
to
monitor
these--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
i--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
scott
d.
makar
under...
under
florida
law
it
is
imposed
upon
the
transaction
and
is
repaid
by
the
buyer
or
the
seller.
but
on
the
question
here--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--that's
correct.
but
here
what
is
happening
is
with
the
pre-confirmation
orders
that
are
coming
out
with
regularity,
those
are
being
used
to
prevent
the
taxes
from
being
paid
and
the
recordation
of--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
it
becomes
an
administrative
burden.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
again,
what
is
happening
with
these
orders
being
granted,
sometimes
the
state
doesn't
even
know
about
it,
and
sometimes--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
the
state
of
florida
doesn't
want
to
stand
in
the
way
of...
nor
do
the
other
states...
in
the
way
of
maximizing
the
value
of
the
estate.
and
in
the
situation
here
we're
talking
about
a
very
small
tax.
it's
only
imposed
in
this
limited
context
as
to
when
a
confirmation
plan
comes
out
in
chapter
11.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
absolutely.
i
don't
concede
away
our
first
argument.
i
think
it's
very
powerful,
which
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
itself,
put
in
the
context
of
this
chapter
11
confirmation
process,
read
in
its
context,
which
is
from
the
post-confirmation
section,
powerfully
supports
the
position
that
this
is
a
post-confirmation
transfer
exemption.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well...
and
then--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
that,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things,
is
what
the
statute
envisions.
that's,
of
course,
not
what
happened
here,
but
that's
the
ordinary
course.
and
this
exemption--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
and
that's
what
happens
in
some
of
these
cases
that
are
transferred
to
chapter
7
or
dismissed,
where
they
get
the
tax
exemption
and
then
get
out
of
the
chapter
11
whirl,
having
gotten
the
tax
exemption,
leaving
the
state
to
have
to
unravel
what
has
been
done.
that's
the
beauty
and
simplicity
of
the
bright-line
rule
of
hechinger
and
nvr,
which
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
says
post...
it
says
confirmed
plan.
so
it
is
at
that
point
that
the
authority
of
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
grant
the
exemption...
the
exemption
exists
and,
thereby,
makes
it
self-executing
in
the
sense
that
the
plan
is
confirmed.
the
order
of
confirmation
provides
the
authority
for
the
exemption;
and
from
that
point
forward
it
works
with...
with
simplicity.
it
is
a
very
straightforward
application
of
the
statute.
and
it's
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
statute,
as
well.
so
i
don't
want
the
court
to
at
all
feel
as
if
i'm
conceding
ground
on
the
language
of
the
statute
or
the
structure
of
the
code
and
how
it
applies
here.
what
i'm...
where
i
think
there
may
be
some
confusion
is
simply
that
in
these
three-quarters
of
the
cases
these
exemptions
are
being
granted,
and
it
is
a
problem
for
the
states
to
have
to
go
out
there
and
to
track
them
down
and
figure
out
what's
going
on
in
these
cases
and
try
to
unravel
the
exemption.
so
it
is
in
that
regard
that
i...
if
one
of
the
exemptions--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--justice
stevens,
it
could
be
both.
i
think
it
could
that
be
we
don't
know
about
it,
so
we
don't
get
the
money.
it
gets
filed,
and
then
we
don't...
the
order
is
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court,
and,
therefore,
the
money
isn't
received--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no.
we've
looked
at
it
to
see
if
there's
any
data.
there's
nothing
that
i
can
give
to
you
with
any
reliability.
i
would
say,
anecdotally,
that
it
is
in
the
low
millions
rather
than
the...
obviously
the
stamp
tax
in
the
state
of
florida
has
been
in
the
billions
of
dollars
overall;
but
that's
not
the
issue
here.
so...
but
it
is
quite
a
few
millions
of
dollars
that
we
believe
is--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--anecdotally,
yes.
as
i
said,
this
is
in
conversations
with
the
department
of
revenue
and
so
forth.
there's
just
no
hard
data.
that's
one
of
the
problems
in
this
area,
since...
i
did
provide
the
court
with
some
data
about
the
number
of
plans
that
are
confirmed
versus
dismissed,
and
so
forth,
and
the
number
of
filings.
we
have
about
a
thousand--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
that
system
does
not
exist.
i
don't
know
how
difficult
it
would
be.
i
would
suspect...
things
sound
simple
sometimes
in
theory,
and
then
in
practice
they
become
very
difficult
in
a
state
as
populous
as--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
absolutely.
and--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--absolutely,
and
it
makes
it
at
that
point
in
time
certain.
and
the
virtue,
again,
of
this
bright-line
rule
is
that
it
provides
certainty,
predictability,
and...
and--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
study
i
cited
to
the
court
about
the
number
of
cases
it
could
be...
has
data
in
there.
it
looks
to
be...
it
was
in
quartiles,
or
something
along
this
line.
it
looks
to
be
like
the
average
is
about...
i
think
it
is
around
450
to
600
days.
i
would
have
to
pull
the
data
and
look
real
closely.
but
that's
on
average.
some
can
be
very
quick;
some
can
take
longer,
depending
on
the
complexity.
a
pre-packaged
plan
like
the
one
we
have
before
us
here,
it's
not
clear
here
why
they
couldn't
have
had
the
plan
confirmed
before
the
transfer.
this
wasn't
a
perishable
commodity
or
things
along
those
lines.
but
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
data.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
that
issue
could
actually
arise;
and
that
was
the
jacoby
case
that,
in
our
view,
sort
of
spawned
a
lot
of
the
problems
here.
there
may
be
some
issues
arising
post-confirmation.
we
concede
that.
that...
but
that's
going
to
be
less
often
than
if
we
have
the
range
of
pre-confirmation.
because
if
we
have
the
range
of
pre-confirmation
transfers
now
being
subject
to
litigation,
it's
going
to
be
at
least
multiples
of...
in
terms
of
the
burden
on
the
state.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
there
is
a
refund
mechanism
for
certain
situations.
i'm
not
sure
if
that
one
would
be
covered,
but
i
believe
it
would
be.
there
are...
there
are
some
me
mechanisms
to
get
a
refund
back
under
the
state's
systems.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
sure,
i'm
be
glad
to,
mr.
chief
justice.
365(g)
here
speaks
in
terms
of
a
rejection
of
an
executory
contract--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--the
full
text?
i'm
sorry;
it'
not.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
this
provision
365(g)
says
the
rejection
of
an
executory
contract
constitutes
a
breach
of
such
contractual
relief
if
the
contractual
relief
is
not
under
a
section
under
a
plan.
what
that
means
is
that
it's
deemed
rejected
if,
at
the
time
of
plan
confirmation...
not
before,
but
at
the
time
of
plan
confirmation.
if
it's
not
in
the
plan,
it's
deemed
a
rejection,
rejected.
that's
merely
a...
an
instrument
to
say
when
the
contract
is...
is
deemed
rejected.
if
it's
in
the
plan
it's
not
rejected.
if
it's
not
in
the
plan...
it
doesn't
get--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--it
says
the

mr.

--rejection
may
occur
before
that,
but
the...
is
referring
to...
rejection
in
an
executory
contract
constitutes
a
breech,
the...
when
it
is
a
breach.
and
it's
only
determined...
determined
to
be
a
breach--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--well,
at
the
point
of...
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
the
point
of
plan
confirmation.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
sure.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
am
following.
but
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
here
is
in
a
different
context,
which
is
saying
that
the
rejection
is...
constitutes
a
breach
but
gas
not
been
assumed,
and
at
that
point
it
has
not
been
assumed,
but
at
the
point
of
confirmation--
mr.
scott
d.
makar
--no.
no.
because
under
a
plan
confirmed
in
365(g)
relates
to
point
of
confirmation
or
beyond,
and
we
believe
under
1146(c)
or
under
1146(a,
congress
has
readopted
it.
mr.
scott
d.
makar
that's
what...
i'm
sorry
yes.
that's...
at
that
point.
that
doesn't
undermine
the
argument
that
under
a
plan
confirmed,
1146(c)
means
at
the
point
of
confirmation
or
beyond.
the
most
natural
reading
of
1146(c)
is
to
provide
this
post-confirmation
transfer
exemption.
no
one
is
contesting
that.
that's
the
natural
reading
of
the...
of
the
statute.
and
the
point
here
of
there
being
more
protection
and,
for
example,
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
state
is
not
on
notice
ob
many
of
these
transfers
as
an
mvr.
those
were
transfers
that
were
outside
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
we
would
give
not
notice
of
that.
and
in
the
ordinary
course
of
363
practice,
parties
that
have
an
interest
in
the
property...
the
state
doesn't...
do
not
get
notice
of
that
proceeding.
so
that...
this
notion
that
there's
more
protection
in
pre-confirmation
than
post-confirmation
is
just
unsupportable.
in...
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
this
is
a
tax
exemption
statute,
and
under
this
court's
principles
it
should
be
narrowly
construed.
it
shouldn't
be
expanded
to
this
pre-confirmation
transfers
with
all
the
problems
it
creates,
in
the
three
quarters
of
cases
that
don't
get
confirmed,
and
have
all
these
intrusions
upon
them,
but...
local
governments
in
their
collection
of
the
stamp
tax.
for
that
reason
we
ask
the
eleventh
circuit
be
reversed.
thank
you.
