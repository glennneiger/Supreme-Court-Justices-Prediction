justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
that.
if
it's
never
confirmed,
then
i
guess
the
tax
is
okay,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
so
what?
isn't
that...
i
mean,
i
assume
that's
totally
illegal,
that
you
get...
i
thought
we're
talking
about
this
provision
where
everybody
agrees
that
it
has
to
be
under
a
plan
confirmed
under
section
1129.
so
if
there's
no
plan
confirmed,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
fall
within
this
exemption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
it's
your
point
exactly,
then
i
guess
i
must
agree
with
that.
i'll
hear
from
the
other
side.
except
i
thought
your
point
was
it
makes
it
difference
whether
the
transfer
takes
place
before
the
plan
is
confirmed
or
after.
so
i
may
be
just
confused
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
i'm
asking
you
this.
you
then
concede...
let
me
for
my
own
point
of
view;
forget
what
the...
maybe
i'm
confused
about
the
facts
or
maybe
i'm
not.
but
let's
suppose
there
is
a
plan
and
it
is
confirmed.
the
transfer,
however,
took
place
a
month
earlier
where
a
private
group
of
creditors
came
together,
every
creditor,
with
the
debtor
and
they
worked
out
a
sale
tomorrow,
and
they
transferred
the
assets
tomorrow.
four
months
later,
the
plan
that
includes
every
word
of
that
goes
before
the
bankruptcy
judge,
the
bankruptcy
judge
thoroughly
understands
the
situation,
and
he
says:
i
confirm
the
plan.
now,
under
those...
in
that
circumstance,
i
guess
you
now
are...
are
you
prepared
to
concede
that
florida
cannot
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
not.
so
then...
then
the
fact
that
there
is
no
plan
seems
to
me
irrelevant,
that
situation,
from
the
present
case.
so
now
let's
look
at
this
case,
where
there
is
a
plan
and
it
is
confirmed.
my
question,
going
back
to
what
i
thought
the
facts
are,
is
this:
imagine
the
situation
i've
just
described...
thorough
investigation
later
by
the
bankruptcy
judge;
plan
including
it
is
confirmed.
and
you
say
if
the
transfer
took
place
first
you
can
assert
your
tax,
but
if
the
transfer
took
place
second,
after
the
plan,
you
can't.
and
my
question,
if
i'm
right
on
my
assumption,
is
i'd
like
you
to
provide
a
reason
why
any
human
being,
a
reasonable
human
being,
would
want
to
make
that
distinction?
why
would
anyone
want
to
say
we
want
to
give
all
the
money
to
the
creditors
and
not
let
florida
get
some
if
it
takes
place,
the
transfer,
after
the
confirmation,
but
would
think
differently
about
it
and
would
want
florida
to
get
some
if
the
transfer
takes
place
before
the
confirmation,
which
confirmation
describes
everything
in
depth,
is
thoroughly
investigated,
et
cetera?
what
reason
could
there
be
for
such
a
distinction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
speaking
of
the
language
for
the
moment.
i
want
you
to
forget
about
the
language
and
assume
the
language
is
ambiguous.
that's
a
different
question.
my
question
is,
assuming
that
the
language
is
ambiguous,
as
every
lower
court
has
found,
assuming
that,
however,
is
there
any
reason
why
a
reasonable
human
being
would
make
this
distinction?
that's
my
question.
and
there
may
be
an
answer,
but
i
want
to
know
what
answer
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
not
an
answer.
[laughter]
i
would
appreciate
an
answer
to
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
problem?
if
that's
the
problem,
i
thought
that
there
had
to
be
a
filing
for
bankruptcy
before
any
of
this
kicks
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
the
answer
can't
be
you
could
go
back
50
years.
the
answer
would
have
to
be
you
go
back
until
the
filing
for
bankruptcy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
and
i'll
add
a
qualification.
i'd
say
i
would
read
into
this
a
context,
and
the
context
is
the
whole
section
that
gives
the
exemption
from
the
state
law
only
kicks
in
when
you
file
for
bankruptcy.
so,
i...
now,
it's
my
question.
i
guess
i
could
make
the
hypothetical
the
the
way
i
want
to
make
it,
and
the
way
i
want
to
make
it
is
that
this
section
applies
once
it
kicks
in,
the
bankruptcy
filing,
and
it
does
not
distinguish
between
the
pre
and
the
post-confirmation,
you
know,
where
the
confirmation
takes
place
after
the
transfer
or
the
transfer
after
the
confirmation.
you're
arguing
to
the
contrary.
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
reason
there
is?
do
i
have
to
repeat
the
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
reason?
that's
what
i
want
you
to
focus
on,
for
making
that
distinction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
not
the
litigation.
what
you've
said
so
far
is,
at
least
as
i
have
taken
it
in,
that
the
practical
harm
is
the
following:
there
will
be
a
certain
number
of
transfers
that
take
place
after
the
filing,
but
before
the
actual
confirmation;
and
in
respect
to
those
transfers,
the
state
is
left
in
a
position
of
uncertainty.
you
don't
know
if
you
can
assert
your
tax
or
not
assert
your
tax
until
that
transfer
is
later
confirmed
as
part
of
the
confirmed
plan
or
not.
that's
what
i
take
it
as
you're
having
said.
and
then
i
think
i'll
hear
in
a
minute
somebody
say,
but
that
kind
of
uncertainty
is
rife
in
the
tax
laws.
it
often
occurs
that
a
taxing
authority
is
not
certain
about
how
to
characterize
a
transaction
until
later
events
take
place
which
are
part
of,
or
related
to,
the
transaction;
and
the
irs
and
all
the
state
tax
departments
survive.
so
if
i'm
right
in
guessing
that,
discuss.
[laughter]
that's
all
i
can
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
you
just
say
that?
why
can't
you
say,
you
want
to
record
this
taxation,
pay
the
tax.
and
when
you
come
in
later,
because
it
was
confirmed,
show
us
the
paper.
we'll
give
you
the
money
back.
how
does
that
interfere
with...
with
anything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
an
administrative
burden?
the
burden
is
entirely
on
the
people
who
want
their
money
back.
they
come
in.
they
file
a
piece
of
paper.
it
says
federal
bankruptcy
judge
signed,
plan
confirmed,
and
it
would
take,
i
guess,
a
few
minutes
to
read
through
it
to
see
they're
telling
the
truth,
which
you
always
have
the
problem
in
a
tax,
and
then
you
give
them
their
money
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
you
can't
file
it
if
they
don't
tell
the
state.
so
if
they're
not
going
to
tell
you,
they're
not
going
to
have
their
transfer
recorded.
i
mean,
look,
we're
going
into
this,
and
on
the
other
side,
of
course,
there
is
the
following
consideration:
that
there
are
creditors
who
are
owed
a
lot
of
money;
and
all
these
creditors
are
in
a
room;
and
they
think,
if
i
can
sell
these
assets
tomorrow,
i'm
going
to
get
a
lot
more
money
than
i
will
if
i
have
to
wait
for
six
months.
that's
why
we
want
to
go
through
with
this.
now
isn't
that
an
important
bankruptcy
interest,
to
make
the
creditors
more
whole?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
is
no
case,
to
your
knowledge...
not
millions
of
dollars,
but
there
is
no
case,
to
your
knowledge,
where,
in
fact,
people
transferred
the
assets;
they
thought
there
would
be
a
plan
confirmed;
there
was
no
plan
confirmed;
and
then
the
state
was
not
paid?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
on
page
38,
the
last
line,
the
next
to
the
last
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
red
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
sorry.
doesn't
the
rejection
have
to
take
place
prior
to
the
plan
being
confirmed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
or
doesn't
it?
prior
to
in
your
opinion
or
not
prior
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
how
that
would
work.
i
have
a
contract
with
boeing
for
$500
million.
i
decide
to
reject
it.
now
if
that
breach
doesn't
occur
until
the
plan
is
confirmed,
how
does
the
trust...
how
does
bankruptcy
judge
know
how
to
treat
boeing
as
a
creditor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
sorry...
doesn't
the
plan
which
its
confirmed
have
a
list
of
the
creditors
and
how
they
are
treated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
how
do
we
write
the
plan
if,
in
fact,
no
breach
has
occurred
and
he
hasn't
become
a
creditor
until
the
plan
is,
in
fact,
confirmed?
