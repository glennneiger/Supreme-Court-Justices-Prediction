are
there
also
instances...
and,
again,
i'm
interested
in
justice
breyer's
question
and
justice
stevens's
question,
the
practical
reasons
that
might
have
prompted
the
statute
to
be
drawn
in
the
way
that
you
say
it's
been
drawn.
are
there
also
instances
where
a
transaction
goes
through
and
is
later
unwound,
is
later
set
aside?
so
that
the
tax
has
to
be
refunded?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
your
point
is
that,
as
a
whole,
the
virtue
of
the
stamp
tax
is
that
it
is
virtually
automatic
on
recording,
and
you
don't
have
to
send
out
notices,
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
whole
point
of
the
stamp
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
one
question
as
to
operation
of
the
tax
in
florida.
suppose
a
transaction...
there's
no
bankruptcy.
a
transaction
is
completed.
stamps
are
paid.
there
is
then
a
suit
to
rescind
the
transaction
on
the
ground
of
fraud
or
mistake.
do
you
get
your
money
back
from
the
stamp
tax?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
can
understand...
just
taking
a
quick
look
at
365(g),
why
it
serves
a
different
purpose
and
a
different
function.
but
the
respondent's
point
was,
you
have
to
interpret
365,
than
under
the
statute
at
issue.
do
you
agree
with
that?
