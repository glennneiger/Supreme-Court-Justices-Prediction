in
fact,
you
do
know,
i
presume,
on
the
statistics
that
the
odds
are
three
to
one
against
there
being
a
confirmed
plan.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
am...
i
don't
quite
follow
the
leap
you
just
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
odd
that
the...
isn't
it
odd
that
the
congress
would
have
required,
we
will
assume,
this
escrow
procedure
when
the
odds
are
three
to
one
against
the
non-taxability?
it
seems
to
me
that
just
as
matter
of
simple
efficiency,
they
would
not
have
required
this
elaborate
procedure
when
the
odds
are
that
the
procedure
would
be
to
no
avail
to
the
bankruptcy
state...
the
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
relevant,
as
your
friend
on
the
other
side
pointed
out,
that
the
particular
section
in
question
occurs
within
the
statute
under
the
general
heading
of
"post-confirmation
matters"?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the...
isn't
the
normal
reading,
if
we're
going
to
give
any
weight
to
the
placement
in
the
statute
at
all...
and
i
think
we're
entitled
to
give
some,
that
unless
there
is
the
kind
of
clarity
that
you've
just
been
describing
in
these
two
exceptions,
that,
in
fact,
the
placement
there
indicates
that
it
is
dealing
with
a
post-confirmation
matter?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
