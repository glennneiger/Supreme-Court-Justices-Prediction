mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
scarcest
and
most
precious
commodity
in
a
chapter
11
case
is
cash.
without
cash,
you
cannot
even
get
to
confirmation.
the
way
in
which
most
debtors
generate
the
cash
necessary
to
get
to
confirmation,
to
pay
all
of
the
things
that
have
to
be
paid
in
cash
on
confirmation
is
through
asset
sales.
in
fact,
this
tax
exemption
is
more
important
for
pre-confirmation
transfers
to
the
confirmation
process
than
post-confirmation
transfers.
here
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
page
127,
you
can
see
the
things
that
had
to
be
paid
on
confirmation
of
this
plan,
including
administrative
expenses.
in
section
1129,
congress
set
forth
the
rule
that
certain
things
have
to
be
paid
in
cash.
every
dollar
that
is
spent
to
pay
a
stamp
tax
cannot
be
used
to
pay
employee
claims,
cannot
be
used
to
pay
for
goods
and
services
the
debtor
desperately
needs
to
reorganize,
and
cannot
be
offered
to
creditors
to
get
their
vote
in
favor
of
the
plan.
there
is
no
reason,
no
reasonable
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
allow
the
exemption
for
a
thousand-dollar
transfer
that
occurs
after
confirmation,
but
not
to
a
ten-million-dollar
transfer
that
occurs
just
prior
to
confirmation.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
depends
on
how
you
define
the
term
"under".
and,
getting
back
to
your
prior
question--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--there
has
not
been
a
confirmed
plan,
but
there
is
often--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
it
requires
that
there
be
a
plan
confirmed.
now,
it
doesn't
say
"confirmed
plan".
where
congress
intended
to
foreclose
discussion,
it
says--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--you
don't
necessarily
know,
justice
scalia.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
souter,
but
that
underscores
how
difficult
it
is
to
confirm
plans
in
chapter
7,
why
congress
wanted
to
make
it
easier
by
providing
this
tax
relief.
you
need
cash
to
confirm.
for
example,
the
administrative
expenses--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
the
whole
purpose
of
1146(a)
is
tax
relief.
it
is
tax
relief
to
provide
more
dollars
for
other
chapter
11
purposes.
you
cannot
confirm
a
plan
without
hard,
cold
cash.
in
the
ltd
bankruptcy,
the
administrative
expenses
that
had
to
be
paid
in
full
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
plan
were
north
of
$200
million.
this
really
makes
a
difference.
this
is
a
live,
flesh-and-blood
problem.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
the
practice
is
to
escrow
the
funds
so
they
will
be
available
as
an
administrative
expense
if
it
turns
out
there
is
no
confirmed
plan.
in
addition,
this
is
no
different
than
any
other
asset
sale
in
bankruptcy
where
if
the
tax
exemption
is
not
allowed,
they
claim
it
as
an
administrative
expense.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
is
the
practice,
justice
ginsburg.
and
the
reason
why
florida
is
never
harmed
is
because
the
procedures
are
the
same
whether
it
is
a
chapter
11
case
or
chapter
7.
they
have
to
come
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
file
a
request
for
payment
of
this
kind
of
tax
anyway.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
none
that
i'm
aware
of,
justice
breyer.
and
here
is
why
that
shouldn't
happen.
it
is
theoretically
possible,
but
here
is
why
that
should
not
happen.
because
when
the...
a
transfer
is
made
under
section
360(c)...
excuse
me,
363...
the
transfers
are
made
free
and
clear
of
all
claims
in
interest.
that's
what
section
363
provides.
if
the
state
wants
to
get
its
tax,
in
the
ordinary
course
it
comes
into
the
bankruptcy
court
anyway,
just
as
florida
did
in
this
case,
to
file
a
request
for
payment
of
the
tax.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
because
the
exemption
applies,
justice
scalia.
the
courts
apply
this
exemption
in
chapter
11.
it
is
only
applied
in
chapter
11,
not
chapter
7.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
souter,
because
the
purpose
of
chapter
11,
as
we
know,
is
to
facilitate
reorganization,
rehabilitation,
saving
jobs.
it
is
very
difficult.
congress
understood
it
would
be
difficult.
that's
why
it
made
chapter
11
more
liberal
than
former
chapter
10
under
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898.
that's
why
we
have
this
tax
relief,
to
provide
more
dollars
that
are
available
to
make
that
process
actually
work.
this
is
a
real
flesh-and-blood
problem.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
sometimes,
chief
justice
roberts,
but
not
often.
and
the
reason
why
we
have
these
asset
sales
quickly
in
bankruptcy,
think
of
the
warehouse
of
the
bananas.
if
you
file
bankruptcy,
you
have
got
to
sell
those
bananas
right
away.
you
can't
wait
for
months
and
months
and
months
until
the
plan
is
confirmed,
because
there's
nothing
left
to
sell.
here
we
have
a
business
which
we
call
the
melting
ice
cube.
it
an
operating
business
with
employees,
but
we've
got
to
get
it
into
the
hands
of
somebody
with
capital
quickly.
otherwise,
this
business
is
going
to
be...
shut
its
doors.
all
of
those
people
will
be
let
go.
that's
why
we
had
a
quick
sale
here:
to
preserve
value,
to
preserve
jobs.
we
couldn't
wait
until
the
plan-confirmation
process
played
out.
and,
in
fact,
there
could
not
have
been
a
confirmed
plan
without
the
sale
because
the
creditors
were
fighting
too
hard
about
who
was
going
to
get
what.
we
had
to
have
the
sale
first,
and
we
had
to
do
it
quickly
to
maximize
the
value,
preserve
the
business,
save
the
jobs.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
chief
justice
roberts,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
creditors
have
diverse
interests.
secure
creditors
often
want
to
liquidate
quickly.
they
want
to
get
their
collateral
liquidated
because
they
may
be
paid
in
full
out
of
that.
that
may
leave
nothing
for
the
unsecured
creditors,
the
tort
victims,
the
employees
who
have
wage
claims,
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation.
in
order
for
there
to
be
cash
for
those
entities,
a
more
negotiated
sale
or
a
different
process
might
have
to
be
followed.
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
there
was
enough
to
pay
the
secured
creditors
in
full
and
give
a
45
to
50
percent
distribution
to
unsecured
creditors,
including
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
is
a
standard
that
we
offer,
justice
alito.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
it
is...
it
is
more
open.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
basically,
justice
alito,
it
encompasses
almost
any
pre-confirmation
transfer.
it's
a
wide
open
standard.
i
want
to
be
up
front
about
that.
you
could
say...
you
could
use
a
dictionary
definition
of
under
in
accordance
with,
it's
about
the
same.
it
would
cover
all
of
pre-petition...
i'm
sorry...
the
pre-confirmation
transfers
where
you
ultimately
have
a
confirmed
plan,
because
all
of
them
will
be
generating
cash
that
make
confirmation
possible.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
a
couple--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
the
standard...
the
test
at
1146(a)
requires
that
there
be
a
plan
confirmed
under
section
1129.
so
we
have
three
parts
of
the
statute.
we
have
an
incident
of
transfer,
that's
undisputed.
we
do
in
this
case
have
a
plan
confirmed
under
section
1129.
and
we
do,
in
fact,
have
a
stamp
tax.
the
question--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--but
we
know,
justice
scalia,
that
in...
where
the
same
language
is
used,
in
section
365(g),
it
cannot
possibly
mean
post-confirmation
events.
it
cannot
possibly.
because
section
365(g)
addresses
assumptions
or
rejections
of
executory
contracts
under
a
plan
confirmed
under
chapter
11.
that
cannot
happen
post
confirmation
because,
as
this
court
said
properly
in
bildisco,
assumption
or
rejection
must
occur
prior
to
confirmation
of
a
plan.
so
the
same
language
used
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
exactly
the
same,
cannot
possibly
mean
post-confirmation.
it
must
mean
something
else.
and
we
think
it
means
a
transfer
that
occurs
either
before
or
after
confirmation
as
long
as
you
have
a
confirmed
plan.
now,
it's
also
critical
that
where
congress
intended
to
foreclose
the
debate
to
require
that
there
be
a
plan
first,
such
as
in
section
1142(b)
or
section
511(b),
congress
said
"under
a
confirmed
plan".
you
cannot
insert
a
verb
between
confirmed
and
plan,
where
it's
confirmed
plan.
in
this
section,
congress...
in
1146(a),
congress
said
plan
confirmed
under
section
1129.
does
that
mean
plan
that
has
been
confirmed,
plan
that
may
be
confirmed,
plan
that
is
confirmed?
it's
ambiguous.
again,
in
section
1142(b),
congress
expressly
dealt
with
transfers
under
a
plan...
under
a
confirmed
plan.
and
in
context,
that
distinct
language
means
there
was
a
plan
first,
and
then
it
authorizes
parties
under
the
plan
to
make
the
transfers
that
are
authorized
under
the
confirmed
plan.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
souter.
and
here's
why.
we
know,
for
example,
in
section
1145(c)(2),
which
is
also
part
of
subchapter
3,
that
expressly
applies
to
an
exemption
for
sales
of
securities
between
the
petition
date
and
the
confirmation
date.
in
addition,
section
1146(b)
itself
allows
for
requests
for
determination
of
the
tax
effects
of
the
plan
before
the
confirmation
date.
so
we
know
for
a
fact
that
the
rules
in
subpart
3,
some
of
them
apply
to
pre-confirmation
periods,
requests,
and
exemptions.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i
think
it
is
entitled
to
some
weight,
justice
souter,
but
i
think
it
is
completely
undercut
by
some
of
the
very
provisions
of
subchapter
3
by
their
terms
apply
to
pre-confirmation
events.
similarly,
some
the
provisions
of
subchapter
2,
section
1127(b)
applies
expressly
to
post-confirmation
matters.
congress
was
not
consistent
in
placement...
placing
things
exclusively
under
one
heading
or
another.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
an
excellent
question,
justice
ginsburg.
the
answer
is,
i
think,
important.
and
there
is
an
excellent
answer,
and
that
is,
whereas
chapter
7
liquidations
are
sort
of
off-the-rack,
chapter
11
liquidations
are
custom-made.
the
plan
is
custom-made
and
tailored
to
the
particular
assets
and
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
the
assets
that
were
sold
in
this
case
was
not
all
the
assets
to
be
sold,
justice
ginsburg.
that
often
happens.
and
this
plan
provides
for
the
orderly
liquidation
in
a
specific
way
of
the
assets
that
weren't,
in
fact,
sold.
there
also
are
all
kinds
of
claims
that
have
to
be
resolved
and
dealt
with.
this
plan,
in
a
customized
way,
dealt
with
with
the
resolution
of
those
claims...
the
pbgc
liabilities,
tort
liabilities,
all
different
kinds
of
liabilities
and
concerns...
in
a
much
more
efficient
and
tailor-made
way
than
could
have
happened
if
the
case
had
been
converted
to
an
off-the-rack
chapter
7
case.
there
is
a
test
which
the
lawyers
and
the
courts
apply
as
to
whether
we
should
stay
in
chapter
11
when
the
situation
has
been
that
most
of
the
assets
have
been
sold
or
whether
we
should
convert
to
chapter
7,
and
that
is
whether
it's
in
the
best
interests
of
the
creditors
and
the
best
interests
of
the
estate
to
stay
in
the
chapter
11.
that
test
was
met
here.
it
was
clearly
in
the
best
interest
to
stay
in
the
chapter
11,
because
we
got
that
customized
procedure:
a
plan
administrator
who
was
appointed
subsequently
who
is
continuing
to
liquidate
assets
and
distribute
the
proceeds.
we
have
all
kinds
of
benefits.
now,
it
is
not
possible
to
confirm
a
chapter
11
plan
simply
to
escape
tax
liabilities.
section
1129
says
you
cannot
confirm
a
plan
if
the
primary
purpose
is
to
escape
tax
liabilities.
so
there
is
a
protection
for
the
state
there
as
well.
here,
of
course,
the
primary
purpose
of
confirming
the
plan
was
not
just
to
he
avoid
tax
liabilities.
it
was
to
do
all
these
other
administrative
things
in
a
custom-made
way.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
section
365(g),
justice
scalia.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
we
quote
it
in
part
on
page
38
of
our
brief.
and
it
is
quoted
in
part
on
page
17
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes.
yes,
justice
scalia.
on
pages
38
and...
37,
38,
and
39,
we
specifically
talk
about
section
365(g)(1),
and
we
cite
the
bildisco
case
and
specifically
made
the
point--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--i
do,
justice
scalia.
let
me
quote
it
for
you
exactly.
section
365(g)
deals
with
what
the
effect
of
a
rejection...
i'm
sorry...
effect
of
breaching
an
executory
contract
is.
and
there
are
two
subparts,
365(g)(1),
which
provides:
"if
such
contract
or
lease
has
not
been
assumed
under
this
section
or.
"
--here's
the
language
that
is
the
same...
"under
a
plan
confirmed
under
chapter
11.
"
so,
if
the
contract
or
lease
has
not
been
assumed
or...
under
this
section,
section
365,
or
under
a
plan
confirmed
under
chapter
11,
then
the
breach
is
basically
deemed
to
have
existed
just
immediately
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
case.
it
is
exactly
the
same
language.
and
it
is
also
in
(g)(2),
the
same
language
is
used
yet
again.
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
the
election
to
assume
or
reject
an
executory
contract
can
occur
post-confirmation.
it
cannot.
why?
because,
as
this
court
explained
in
bildisco,
the
assumption
or
rejection
must
occur
prior
to
confirmation,
up
until
the
point
of
confirmation,
is
the
language
this
court
used.
the
lower
court
decision,
the
twa
case,
et
cetera,
all
say
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
there's
an
important
reason
for
that.
the
standard
for
assumption
or
rejection,
even
if
it
is
elected
in
a
plan,
is
you
have
to
satisfy
section
365.
and
that
has
to
be
done
through
a
court
order,
through
a
court
proceeding
that
has
to
occur
essentially
before
the
court
actually
confirms
the
plan.
so
the
same
language
used--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--because
the
debtor
has
to
elect...
the
debtor
has
to
make
a
decision
before
confirmation
so
we
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
property,
and
so
the
creditor
can
timely
final
a
claim
if
it
is
going
to
be
rejection,
because
the
creditor
does
not
file
a
claim
for
rejection
damages
for
rejection
of
the
contract
until
the
assumption
or
rejection
is
determined.
that
particular
thing
is
postponed.
but
we
must
know
that
prior
to
confirmation
because
we
have
to
know
how
to
treat
the
creditor's
claim;
if
we
have
to
pay
that
creditor
significant
money,
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
property.
for
example,
justice
souter,
suppose
it
is
a
contract
to
purchase
a
boeing
767
for
$600
million.
the
debtor
might
file
for
bankruptcy,
one
of
the
airlines
files
for
bankruptcy
and
might
have
to
decide
whether
to
honor
that
obligation
or
to
reject
that
obligation,
assume
it
or
reject.
we
need
to
have
that
information.
we
need
to
know
if
the
debtor
is
going
to
have
to
pay
that
$600
million
before
confirmation.
we
can't
wait
until
after
because
it's
too
important
to
the
plan.
it's
too
important
in
dealing
with
the
asset.
that's
why
all
the
courts,
including
this
one,
have
said
you
must
make
the
assumption-or-rejection
election
up
until
confirmation,
never
after.
so
it
can't
be
the
case
that
the
specific
language
"under
a
plan
confirmed
under
chapter
11.
"
as
used
in
section
365
refers
to
post-confirmation,
but
that
is
in
fact
the
same
language
used
in
section
1146.
now,
contrast
that
with
the
language
used
in
sections
1142(b)
or
511(b),
which
talks
about
a
"confirmed
plan".
and,
in
context,
that
language
clearly
means
a
plan
comes
first.
congress
could
have
used
that
same
formulation
in
section
1146(a);
it
chose
not
to.
and
under
russello
and
the
other
precedents
of
this
court's
canons
of
construction,
we
should
give
that
semantic
choice
its
deference.
and,
again,
there's
a
reason.
so
a
statute--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--in
context,
yes,
chief
justice
roberts.
and
if
you
look
at
section
1142(b),
i
think
you
can...
you
can
actually
see
in
context
why
that
so
clearly
means...
that
so
clearly
means
the
plan
comes
first
and
then
is
confirmed.
but
again,
it's
different
language
that
is
used.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
by
statute,
chief
justice
roberts,
section
103
provides
that
the
provisions
of
chapter
11,
in
chapter
11,
including
section
1146,
apply
only
in
a
chapter
11
case.
there
is
no
case--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--the
only
sections
that
apply
basically
to
pre-bankruptcy,
pre-petition
matters,
are
the
avoidance
powers
in
section,
for
example,
the
preference
actions
in
section
547,
the
fraudulent
transfer
provisions
in
section
548.
those
things
expressly
apply
to
pre-bankruptcy
events,
and
they
say,
before
the...
"90
days
before
the
commencement
of
the
case.
"
those
kinds
of
things.
when
congress
wanted
to
reach
back
before
the
petition
date,
it
used
very
specific
terms
of
the
art,
very
specific
authorization.
nothing
like
that
appears
anywhere
in
section
1146(a),
and
for
good
reason.
it's
very
clear,
and
every
court
to
have
looked
at
this
has
so
held,
that
1146(a)
does
not
apply
before
the
case
is
commenced.
and
that
makes
sense
because
the
purpose
is
to
give
tax
relief
to
facilitate
the
chapter
11
process.
you
want
to
have
cash
available--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
stevens.
in
fact,
that
has
to
happen.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
yes,
justice
stevens,
it
must.
and
under
section
363,
the
bankruptcy
court
must
approve
sales
like
this
on
notice
to
creditors,
which
would
include
the
state.
and
here,
in
fact,
what
happened
is
consistent
with
what
happens
in
almost
every
bankruptcy
case.
because
the
state
has
an
interest,
a
taxing
interest,
in
the
transfer,
the
state
will
get
notice,
which
florida
gave
here.
they
have
an
opportunity
to
come
and
object
if
they
wish
to,
which
they
did
here.
there
are
actually
more
protections
for
the
state
for
pre-confirmation
transfers
than
post-confirmation
transfers.
after
the
confirmation
of
the
plan,
the
bankruptcy
court's
work
is
essentially
done,
and
then
you're
just
out
in
the
world
under
the
plan
and
the
debtor
is
making
sales
and
transfers.
there
isn't
the
opportunity
for
the
state
to
come
in
and
actually
object
to
things
as
there
is
pre-confirmation.
so
here
the
state
actually
has
more
protections
for
the
pre-confirmation
sale--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
for
example--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--there's
a
very
practical
reason
for
that
question,
chief
justice
roberts,
and
that
is
in
this
case
the
bankruptcy
court
specifically
determined
in
his
order,
judge
in
his
order,
that
the
exemption
would
apply.
so
that
was
determined
in
the
order.
of
course--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--well,
you
can't
have
a
sale
until
the
bankruptcy
court
approves
it.
in
the
process
of
approval,
the
bankruptcy
court
was
asked
and
made
the
determination
that
1146(a)
would
apply.
now,
what
happens
then
is
the
state
can
come
in
and
has
the
right
to
file
a
request
for
payment
of
administrative
expense
and
the
funds
are
escrowed,
because
if
in
fact
there
ends
up
not
being
a
confirmed
chapter
11
plan,
then
the
state
is
entitled
to
its
tax,
and
the
money
is
then
paid
to
the
state,
its
request
for
payment
of
administrative
expenses
is
allowed,
and
it
gets
is
money.
but
this
can
make--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--it's
not
always
escrowed,
justice
scalia.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that
is
the
practice,
but
it's
not
uniform
because
in
some
cases
there's
no
need
for
an
escrow.
there
are
some
cases
in
which
we
know
there's
going
to
be
enough
cash
available
that
the
state
will
be
paid,
so
we
don't
need
that
safety.
but
the
state
can
always
ask
for
it,
and
if
the
state
asks
for
it
i'm
almost
certain
in
most
cases
it
will
get
it.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
relevant
in
the
sense
that
congress
was
clearly
intending
here
to
grant
tax
relief
to
chapter
11
debtors
to
facilitate
the
chapter
11
process.
it's
not
a
tax
exemption,
justice
alito,
in
the
sense
of,
for
example,
an
exemption
to
a
revenue-raising
provision.
in
other
words,
you
could
have
a
state
statute
that
says:
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
raise
taxes
and
we'll
create
exemptions.
that's
one
context.
and
there
it
might
make
sense
to
say:
well,
look,
while
the
overall
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
raise
revenue,
we
might
construe
the
exceptions
to
that
purpose
narrowly.
here
the
purpose
of
chapter
11
is
to
facilitate
the
chapter
11
process.
so
i
think
we
construe
this
revenue-raising...
i'm
sorry...
this
tax
relief
measure
consistent
with
that
overall
purpose.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
that's
the
limitation
that
the
united
states
wanted
to
add
to
section
267
of
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898.
congress
did
not
grant
the
united
states'
request.
the
united
states
said
this
is
administratively
too
difficult
to
administer,
and
congress
rejected
that
testimony
from
the
representative
of
the
treasury
and
enacted
section
267
over
the
objection
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
united
states
after
the
excise
tax
reduction
act,
i
think
of
1965,
does
not
really
have
many
excise
taxes.
and
so
the
testimony
of
the
commissioner
of
the
internal
revenue
code...
revenue
service
in
1978,
when
the
bankruptcy
code
was
being
adopted,
was
that
the
united
states
doesn't
really
care
about
stamp
taxes.
it
really
didn't
have
a
position
on
it.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
4382(b)?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
was
that
the
revenue
provisions--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that
one
i'm
not
certain
of,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
no,
justice
ginsburg.
there
the
three...
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
statute
is
section
77(b)(f)
and
then
went
to
section
267
and
then
went
to
section
1146.
that's
the
direct--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--that
may,
justice
ginsburg,
have
been
a
mirror
provision.
before
1938,
the
tax-exemption
provisions
under
the
bankruptcy
code
were
mirrored.
there
was
a
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act
in
section
77(b)(f).
there
were
also
mirroring
provisions
under
the
bankruptcy...
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
those
were
eliminated
and
instead
we
just
have
section
267
under
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898,
which
dealt
with
the
exemption
in
bankruptcy.
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that,
going
back
to
your
earlier
point,
i
think
it's
important
to
underscore
that
the
context
of
this
case
is
different
from
other
contexts
in
which
the
discussion
of
how
we
should
construe
a
tax
exemption
applies.
i
think
the
court
here
should
apply
the
analysis
that
it
applied
in
dolan,
where
the
court
was
considering
application
of
a
similar
canon
of
narrow
construction,
and
the
court
said:
well,
in
construing
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
in
juxtaposition
to
this
concept
that
we
construe
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
narrowly,
we
don't
apply
that
because
that
would
basically
run
afoul
of
the
purpose
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
provisions.
the
same
thing
here.
the
proper
rule
of
resolution
where
we
have
an
ambiguous
statute
is
to
look
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
the
purpose
here
is
to
make
chapter
11
easier
by
granting
tax
relief.
and
i
think
that,
consistent
with
that
purpose,
the
court
should
construe
section
1146(a)--
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
--yes,
justice
scalia?
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
that...
that's
true
in
general,
justice
scalia,
but
if
congress
had
really
wanted
to
narrow
the
purpose
here
to
post-confirmation,
it
would
have
surely
used
the
temporal
limitations
it
used,
for
example
in
section
1127,
where
the
court
said
before...
the
congress
said
before
confirmation
you
do
this;
after
confirmation
you
do
that.
that
is
a...
that
is
a
standard
legislative
technique
used
throughout
the
bankruptcy
code
that
was
not
used
in
section
8.
mr.
g.
eric
brunstad,
jr.
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
as
the
court
stated
in
ardestani,
quote,
"the
word
"under"
has
many
dictionary
definitions,
and
we
must
draw
its
meaning
from
its
context.
"
close
quote.
and
under
robinson,
the
court
looked
to,
where
there
was
an
ambiguous
statute,
the
purpose
as
the
way
to
resolve
the
ambiguity,
and
i
submit
that
should
happen
here.
thank
you
very
much.
