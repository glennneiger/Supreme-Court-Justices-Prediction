absolutely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
were
asked,
and
i
think
tried
to
answer
and
never
got
your
answer
out,
and
i'd
like
to
hear:
what
is
it
you
were
saying
about
cases
in
which
pre-confirmation
transfers
are
made
and
the
tax
exemption
is
made?
did
you
start
to
tell
us
that
you
might
never
recover
the
tax
later
on?
or
what
kind
of
a
problem
does
it
create?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
then
the
question
is,
can
you
nevertheless,
in
an
untimely
fashion,
eventually
get
the
tax
imposed
and
the
tax
collected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
tax
imposed
on
the
purchaser,
not
the
bankrupt's
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
tax
imposed
on
the
purchaser,
rather
than
the
bankrupt's
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
i
guess
this
has
been
the
rule
in
florida
for
awhile.
there's
a
problem,
and
has
the
problem
been
that
you
actually
don't
get
the
money?
or
is
it
an
administrative
problem,
keeping
track
of
things
and
finding
out
whether
or
not
you
are
entitled
to
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
studies
showing
how
much
money
you've
actually
lost
by
this
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
i
understand
you
correctly?
you
say
you
have,
in
fact,
lost
millions
of
dollars
from
the
failure
to
get
access
under
this
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
normally,
because
you
do
require
recording,
that
there
would
be...
it
wouldn't
be
all
that
difficult
to
keep
track
of
all
these
cases
in
which
there
had
been
transferred
pre-confirmation
transfers.
and
if
you
did
you
have
some
filed
in
the
computer
that
had
them
all
there,
as
soon
as
the...
if
the
confirmation
did
not
occur,
you
could
just
go
ahead
and
send
out
the
bills.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it...
another
question
i
had:
is
it
not
true
that
even
under
your
rule
there
will
be
a
number
of
cases
that,
even
though
it
was
clear
that
the
transaction
was
after
the
confirmation,
there's
an
issue
as
to
whether
it
was
under
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this.
as
a
practical
matter
does
the
judge,
the
bankruptcy
judge,
enter
some
kind
of
an
order
approving
the
transfer,
even
though
it's
pre-confirmation,
an
order
to
establish
the
tax
exemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
would
have
to
be
after
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
