i
mean,
you
could
say
this
was
congress,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
whole
case
is
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wants
a
reason
why
that
might
be.
do
you
know
many
instances
in
which
congress
has
set
up
a
system
in
which
you
cannot
determine
whether
a
state
tax
is
valid
or
invalid
until
some
future
event
at
an
indeterminate
time
which
may
be
three
years
later?
is
that
customary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
someone
not
to
know
whether
the
tax
is
payable
or
not
for
sure
until
three
years
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
good
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
harm
is
done?
could
you
tell
us
in
just
a
few
words,
what's
the
harm?
that's
what
justice
breyer's
concerned
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
solvency
of
the
person
who
has
tentatively
been
declared
exempt
from
your
tax;
so,
therefore,
you
can't
go
get
him
right
away?
this
is
not
the
ordinary
citizen.
this
is
somebody
who
is
on
the
edge
of
bankruptcy.
you
would
normally
want
to
get
your
money
out
of
him
as
soon
as
possible
before
he
squanders
what
is
left,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
would
it...
would
it
not
happen
with
some
frequency
that,
even
though
you
could
have
collected
the
tax
three
years
earlier,
by
the
time
it
turns
out
for
sure
that
there's
never
going
to
be
a
chapter
11
confirmation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
makar,
you
were
going
to
address,
i
take
it,
the
assumption
that
justice
breyer
has
asked
you
to
make,
which
is
that
the
language
here
is
ambiguous.
and
your
position
is,
i
take
it,
that
"confirmed"
means
"confirmed"?
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes
don't
they
want
the
transfer
to
be
effective
whether
or
not
there
is
a
later
confirmation?
i
thought
that
that
was
the
assumption
here:
that
some
of
these
transfers
they
want
to
be
effective
whether
or
not
a
confirmation
occurs
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
don't
know
whether
that
second
one
will
ever
be
a
sale
under
a
plan,
which
is
what
the
code
requires.
it
has
to
be
a
transfer
under
a
plan.
and
when
it
occurs,
you
don't
know
whether
it
is
going
to
be
an
under
plan
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
time
it
occurs
it
doesn't
matter
how
you
define
the
term.
there
is
no
way
at
the
time
it
occurs
to
say
that
this
is
a
transfer
under
a
plan.
there
hasn't
been
a
confirmed
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
requires
under
a
plan
confirmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
"a
plan
confirmed".
how
do
you
know
at
the
time
the
transfer
is
made
whether
it
is
under
a
plan
confirmed?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
at
all
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
have
no
reason
to
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
you
are
not
the
state.
the
state
has
told
us
that
millions
of
dollars
have
been
lost
in
taxes
not
recovered.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
missed
the
crucial...
the
crucial
part.
the
transfer
has
to
be
under
a
plan
confirmed.
i
mean,
that's
the
troublesome
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
section
you
mentioned
earlier
that
uses
"under"
in
a
sense
that
clearly
applies
to
pre-confirmation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
looking
for
it,
and
i
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
you
make
that
argument
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
that
provision
read?
do
you
have
it
quoted
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
always
escrowed?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
a
uniform
practice?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
we've
said
in
other
opinions
no...
no
statute
pursues
its
purposes
at
all
costs.
and
the
limitations
contained
in
a
statute
are
as
much
a
part
of
its
purpose
as
the
broad
purpose
that
you
just
mentioned.
i
mean,
if
a...
if
a
"plan
confirmed"
means
a
plan
confirmed,
that
limitation
is
part
of
the
purpose
no
less
than
the
broad
purpose
that
you
express.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe,
but
"under
a
plan
confirmed"
seems
under
normal
interpretation
of
language
to
me
to
mean
under
a
plan
that
has
been
confirmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
spelled
out
somewhere
in
the...
is
its
text
somewhere
in
these
materials?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
full,
not
the
full
section,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
little
snippets
of
it.
