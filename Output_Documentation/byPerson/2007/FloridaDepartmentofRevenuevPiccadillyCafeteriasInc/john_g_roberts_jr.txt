chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-312,
florida
department
of
revenue
versus
piccadilly
cafeterias.
mr.
makar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
one
of
the
reasons
would
be
how
far
do
you
go
back?
i
mean,
you
go
back
three
years
and
say,
well,
you
know,
the
bankruptcy
judge
can
say,
part
of
what
i'm
confirming
is
the
sale
that
took
place
three
years
ago,
so
you
can
file
for
a
refund,
i
guess.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
does
there
have
to
be...
there
has
to
be
a
filing
for
bankruptcy
before
you
get
a
plan
confirmed,
but
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
threshold
before...
what
does
that
mean,
there
has
to
be
a
filing
for
bankruptcy?
that
the
confirmation
of
the
plan
can't
go
back
before
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
goes
back
before
then
in
a
lot
of
cases
to
look
for
preferential
transfers
and
things
like
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
was
saying
there's
another
key
event
and
that's
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
bankruptcy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
practical
consequences
of
your
position.
i
assume
that
if
you're
right,
people
who
have
an
interest
in
buying
the
bankrupt
business
will
wait
or
have
to
wait
until
after
confirmation
of
the
plan,
because
the
tax
liability
is
going
to
save
them
a
lot
of
money.
is
it
going
to
work
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
will
the
effect
of
your
plan
be
that
it
will
discourage
people
who
come
along
and
want
to
buy
a
bankrupt
business?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
this
is
a
big
deal.
assuming
that
was
news
to
me,
that
this
only
arises
after
the
filing
of
a
bankruptcy
petition,
and
you
are
looking
forward
to
confirmation
of
the
plan,
this
tax
only
applies
at
the
transfer
of
title.
why
don't
you
just
get
your
deal
together
and
just
say,
well,
the
closing
is
going
to
be
the
day
after
confirmation
of
the
bankruptcy
plan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
when
you
transfer
title,
and
that's
when
you
have
to
pay
the
stamp
tax.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
long
does
it
typically
take
from
the
filing
of
the
petition
to
confirmation
of
the
bankruptcy
plan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
brunstad.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
often
the
case...
and
i
don't
know,
but
is
it
often
the
case
that
the
people
who
are
engaged
in
one
these
asset
purchases
are,
in
fact,
the
creditors
themselves?
in
other
words,
they
are
owed
a
lot
of
money
and
said,
well,
let's...
basically,
let's
take
over
the
business
and
run
it
ourselves?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
assume
that
the
creditors
have
an
interest
in
that
as
well.
i
don't
know
how...
i
mean,
they
are
the
ones
who
could
move
quickly
to
get
the
confirmation
of
the
plan,
because
they
are
the
ones
whose
interests
have
to
be
addressed
before
the
plan
can
be
confirmed.
so
wouldn't
they
have
an
interest
in
the
melting
bananas,
or
whatever?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
your
arguments
about
the
desirability.
how
do
you
squeeze
it
into
the
statutory
language?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
a
plan
and
you're
suggesting
that
it's
under
the
plan
before
there
is
a
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
there
is
that
"under
a
plan
confirmed"
means
something
different
than
"under
a
confirmed
plan"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you...
do
you
agree
with
the
proposition
that
you
only
go
back
so
far
as
the
filing
of
the
petition?
well,
what
in
your
argument
suggests
that
that's
a
logical
stopping
point?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
don't
take
the
date
of
confirmation,
i
don't
know
why
all
of
your
policy
arguments
wouldn't
cause
you
to
go
back
further.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
we've
already
shown
a
willingness
to
abandon
that
type
of
limitation
with
"under
a
plan
confirmed".
so,
you
know,
the
consideration
of
the
prior
transfer
is
going
to
take
place
in
the
context
of
a
bankruptcy
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
know
whether
to
pay
the
tax
or
not?
i
mean,
you
know
that
the
bankruptcy
petition
has
been
filed,
but
you
really
don't
know
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
plan
confirmed
under
chapter
11.
how
do
you
know
whether
to
pay
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
assume
there
are
penalties
if
you
don't
pay
on
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
this
doesn't
happen
for
some
time
down
the
road,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
up
to,
i
guess...
we
were
told
up
to
400
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
brunstad.
mr.
makar,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining,
and
during
those
five
minutes
i
hope
you'll
give
an
answer
if
you
have
one
to
the
365(g)(1)
argument
that
your
friend
has
made.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
argument
is
that
you
don't
have
a
rejection
of
the
executory
conduct...
contract...
until
the
plan
is
confirmed?
that's
what
congress--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-312,
florida
department
of
revenue
versus
piccadilly
cafeterias.
