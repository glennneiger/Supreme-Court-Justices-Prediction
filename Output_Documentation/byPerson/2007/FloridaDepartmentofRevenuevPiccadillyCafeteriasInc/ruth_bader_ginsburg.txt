there's
another
assumption
then
that
was
in
justice
breyer's
question
about,
well,
you
have
to
have
the
petition,
the
bankruptcy
petition.
but
in
this
very
case
wasn't
the
sale...
wasn't
the
basic
arrangement
made
the
day
before
the
petition
was
filed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
are
you
not...
are
you
questioning...
what
i
understand
to
be
the
case,
it's
not
at
all
uncommon
for
a
chapter
11
these
days
to
have
the
363(b)
sale
of
property,
then
have
some
kind
of
global
settlement,
and
then
distribute
all
the
assets,
never
have
any
kind
of
reorganization.
and
i
didn't
understand
that
it
was
necessary
to
kick
the
case
over
into
chapter
7.
aren't
there
many
cases
filed
under
chapter
11
that
end
up
with
no
reorganization?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i
don't
understand
about
the...
how
the
florida
system
works,
i
thought
you
don't
get...
you
don't
get
the
transfer
recorded
until
you
pay
the
tax.
i
thought
that's
what
florida
law
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought,
mr.
brunstad,
that
the
question
was
asked:
so
the
state
is
not
going
to
get
its
tax
at
the
time
of
the
asset
transfer,
because
the
cash
is
needed
to
eventually
have
a
plan
that
works.
so
the
state
doesn't
get
its
tax.
and
then
it
turns
out
that
there
is
no
plan;
that
the
case
is
dismissed.
what
happens
then?
florida
has
to
get
back...
at
that
point
gets
the
tax
that
it
wanted
up
front?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
are
all
paid
up
front,
but
they
are
put
into
escrow.
is
that
what
you
are
telling
me?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
brunstad,
there's
an
aspect
of
the
way
this
looks
that
i
don't
understand,
and
you're
an
expert
in
this
area.
perhaps
you
can
explain
it
to
me.
you
have
one
of
these
363(b)
sales
of
property,
and
then
you
have
a
global
settlement
with
the
creditors.
what
function
does
the
plan
serve
after
you
have
all
that?
the
assets
have
been
sold.
the
creditors
have
made
a
settlement.
there's
going
to
be
no
reorganization;
whatever
there
is,
is
going
to
be
distributed.
what
is
the
function
of
having
a
plan
after
all
that
confirmed?
i
know
one
purpose
of
it
is
that
you
avoid
paying
the
stamp
tax.
but
is
there
any
other
purpose
once
you
have
already
settled
that
the
sale
is
made,
the
creditors
agree
on
how
it's
going
to
be
divided
up?
what
is
the
function
that
the
plan
serves?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
shouldn't
we
look
to
see
how
it
was
in
the
internal
revenue
code
with
respect
to
the
federal
state
tax
exemption?
that
i
think
leaves
no
room
for
argument.
this
case
might
be
argued
either
way
about
does
it
apply
to
preconfirmed
plan
asset
transfers?
but
as
i
understand
it,
this
section
4382(b)
was
limited
to
post-confirmation
transfers,
that
is
transfers
made
within
five
years
after
confirmation
of
the
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
was...
what
did
section...
i'm
not
talking
about...
you
mentioned
267.
42...
4382(b),
what
did
that
say?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
section...
26
u.s.c.
4382(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
in
the
1954
code.
i'm
not
talking
about
1898.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
said
that
the
tax
exemption
was
limited
to
transfers
post-confirmation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
you
can
straighten
me
out,
because
where
i
get
this
from
is
the
brief
for
the
state,
and
it's
at
page
17,
mentions
the
now-repealed
4382(b).
