justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
respondent,
piccadilly
cafeterias
declared
bankruptcy
under
chapter
11,
but
before
piccadilly
submitted
its
chapter
11
plan
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
piccadilly
sought
and
received
court
authorization
to
sell
substantially
all
of
its
assets,
and
was
granted
an
exemption
from
state
stamp
tax
pursuant
to
11
u.s.c.
section
1146(a).
that
section
provides
a
stamp
tax
exemption
for
any
asset
transfer,
"under
a
plan
confirmed
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code.”
piccadilly
submitted
and
received
court
approval
of
its
chapter
11
plan
but
only
after
the
sale
of
its
assets
had
been
taken
place.
petitioner,
florida
department
of
revenue
objected,
arguing
that
the
stamp
taxes,
it
had
assessed
on
certain
of
piccadilly's
transferred
assets
fell
outside
the
section
1146(a)
exemption
because
at
the
time
of
the
sale,
the
transfers
at
issued
were
not
under
a
plan
confirmed.
the
district
court
upheld
the
bankruptcy
courts
grant
of
the
exemption
and
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed,
holding
that
the
section
1146(a)
exemption
applies
to
pre-confirmation
transfers
necessary
to
the
consummation
of
a
plan
that
is
eventually
confirmed
under
chapter
11,
provided
there
is
some
nexus
between
such
transfers
and
the
plan.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
most
natural
reading
of
section
1146(a)'s
text,
the
provisions
placement
within
the
bankruptcy
code
and
applicable
substantive
cannons
all
lead
to
the
same
conclusion.
section
1146(a)
affords
a
stamp
tax
exemption
only
to
transfers
made
pursuant
to
a
chapter
11
plan
that
has
already
been
confirmed.
first
to
phrase,
under
a
plan
confirmed
is
most
naturally
read
to
mean
that
the
plan
must
be
confirmed
at
the
time
assets
are
sold
and
transferred
under
it.
second,
the
natural
reading
is
consistent
with
the
provision’s
placement
in
a
subchapter
entitled,
“post-confirmation
matters.”
finally,
construing
section
1146(a)
narrowly
to
apply
only
to
post-confirmation
transfers
is
compelled
by
the
long
standing
cannon
that
courts
should
narrowly
interpret
an
exemption
from
state
taxation,
that
congress
has
not
clearly
expressed.
in
sum,
because
section
1146(a)
does
not
apply
to
pre-confirmation
transfers,
piccadilly
may
not
avoid
florida's
stamp
taxes
by
invoking
back
that
provision.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
