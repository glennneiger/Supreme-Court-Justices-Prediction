justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
agree
that
the
republic
is
ultimately
not
going
to
be
able
to
collect
these
funds
unless
it
sues
in
the
united
states
and
waives
its
immunity
in
that
suit?
and
is
that...
is
that
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
it
should
have
been
forced
to
proceed
in
this
action?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
they
just...
they
in
fact
are
obstructing
the
process--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--trying
to
recognize
it?
