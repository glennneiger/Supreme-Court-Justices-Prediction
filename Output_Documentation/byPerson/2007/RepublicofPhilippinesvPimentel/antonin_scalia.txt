is
there
anything
else
in
the
estate?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much
of
an
interest
does
the
estate
have
if
it
is
all
going
to
be
claimed
by...
by
these
private
plaintiffs?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
what
does
unfairness
have
to
do
with
it?
i
mean
the
whole
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
rests
upon
unfairness.
it
says
you
can't
sue
the
sovereign
even
if
you
have
a
valid
claim.
and
when
we
say
we
will
apply
the
same
doctrine
as
to
foreign
sovereigns,
it
means
the
same
thing.
i'm
just
not
terribly
persuaded
by
the
fact
that
it
has
unfair
consequences.
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
always
has
unfair
consequences.
so,
unless
you're
asking
us
to
abandon
the
doctrine,
the
fairness
argument
does
not
persuade
me.
