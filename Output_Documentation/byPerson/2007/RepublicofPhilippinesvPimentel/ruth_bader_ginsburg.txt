that's
been
pending
how
long?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
from
2004
to
2008?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rothfeld,
will
you
explain
then
how
it
was
that
the
philippine
government
supported
the
litigation
against
marcos
that
led
to
the,
what
was
it,
the
$2
billion
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
said
that
it
had
no
objection
to
that
suit.
in
fact,
he
thought
it
was
a
good
thing
for
the
philippines
that
that
litigation
go
forward.
but
if
the
government's
position
is
the
judgment
would
be
uncollectible
because
all
of
those
assets
belonged
to
the
philippine
government
and
not
to
marcos's
estate,
so
the...
that
whole
litigation
would
have
been
an
exercise
in
futility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
other
point
of
philippine
law
that's
unclear
from
the
briefs.
the
respondents
say
they
have
no
right
to
intervene
in
the
proceeding
that's
going
on
before
the
corruption
court
and
your
brief
suggests
that
there
is
a
right
to
intervene.
what
is
it?
can
they
become
part
of
that
litigation
or
will
they
not
be
heard
by
the
corruption
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
seek
to
intervene,
but
no
right
to
intervene?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
privity
with
the
estate?
you're
suggesting
that
the
plaintiffs
would
be
connected
to
the
marcos
family
that
wants
to
get
these
assets?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
say
mr.
kneedler,
then
you
are
not
agreeing
with
mr.
rothfeld,
who
says
it's
automatic?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
that
depend
on
there
being
a
foreign
judgment,
which
we
don't
have
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
also
a
requirement
that
in
that
proceeding
in
the
foreign
nation
that
all
claimants
would
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
which
is
not
true
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
explanation
why
the
freeze
that
was
imposed
by
a
u.s.
court
in
1987
was
simply
allowed
to
lapse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
like
you
to
address...
you
seem
to
put
heavy
weight
on
this
in
rem
characterization.
that
is
a
judgment
there's
a
thing.
but
our
law
over
the
years
has
come
to
appreciate
that
things
do
not
have
rights;
people
have
rights
in
things.
so
we
have
modified
the
once
rigid
notion
that
the
suit
is
against
a
thing,
to
recognize
that
it's
people's
rights
in
the
thing
that
count.
and
your
use
of
that
label
seems
to
forget
about
all
the
more
recent
understanding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did...
did
the
district
court
in
hawaii
or
the
ninth
circuit
ever
decide
what
the
petitioners
tell
us
is
the
basic
question,
that
is
do
these
assets
belong
to
the
philippine
government
under
that
1955
statute,
or
do
they
belong
to
the
marcos
estate?
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
courts
were
just
assuming
that
the
assets
belonged
to
the
marcos
estate
and
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
lawsuit
were
creditors
of
the
marcos
estate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
didn't
say,
find,
that:
and
they
belong
to
the
marcos
estate
and
not
the
philippine
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
what...
that's
what
sovereign
immunity
means.
i
mean,
they
do
have
the
right
to
pick
their
forum.
you
say
i
can
only
be
sued
when
i
consent,
so
i
can
consent
where
i
will.
the
problem
with
what
you're
presenting
is
it
sounds
like,
yes,
you
have
sovereign
immunity,
you
don't
have
to
be
part
of
this
lawsuit
and
it
can't
affect
your
rights,
but
then
when
it
seems
to
be
eventual
judgment,
it's
a
default
judgment
effectively
against
the
philippines,
because
they
can
never
get
those
assets
once
they're
disbursed.
so,
it's
a...
it's
kind
of
a
deceptive
immunity,
because
by
asserting
the
immunity
they
are
going
to
lose
their
opportunity
to
claim
these
assets.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
necessarily.
i'm
focusing
on
this
situation.
there
could
be
others.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
ninth
circuit
went
on
a
statute
of
limitations
in
new
york.
it
didn't
give
the
sovereign
immunity
claim,
it
seems,
in
the
end
of
the
day
any
weight,
because
it
says
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
philippines
being
out
of
this
case
because
they
would
have
no
claim
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
that?
then
why
were
they
bothering
with
the
statute
of
limitations?
both
courts
said
that
the
action
would
be
time
barred
in
new
york.
but
if
they
made
a
definitive
ruling
that
the
assets
belonged
to
the
marcos
estate
and
not
the
philippine
government,
then
that
would
be
preclusive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
did
not
find
in
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
an
answer
to
that
basic
question:
whose
assets
are
they?
it
seemed
to
me
they
were
assuming
the
assets
belonged
to
the
estate
and
not
to
the
philippine
government,
but
they
made
no
specific
finding
on
that
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you're
ignoring
a
1955
law
that
says
anything
that
belongs
to
marcos
that
he
didn't
get
legitimately
belongs
to
the
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that...
i
mean
it
sounds
shocking,
but
i
thought
that
in
the
philippines,
as
in
many
countries,
the
filing
fee
is
determined
by
what
you're
asking
for.
so
it
would
be
a
percentage
of
$2
billion.
and
if
they
just
did
that
automatically,
then
you
say,
oh,
but,
but
this...
the
filing
fee
of
that
size
would
mean
that
the
plaintiffs
can't
sue.
but
that's...
but
it
wasn't
they
picked
whatever
figure,
filing
fee,
out
of
a
hat;
it
was
a
percentage
of
what
was
sought
in
the
litigation
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
they
do
because
if
they
are
able
to
successfully
knock
out
the
judgment,
then
they
are
back
to
square
one.
then
they...
they
lost
on
the
merits,
but
that
judgment
would
be
wiped
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
was
no
authority
of
the
court
to
proceed,
then
the
judgment
is...
is
as
though
it
were
never
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if...
if
the
proceeding
can't
go
forward
because
of
sovereign
immunity,
that
judgment
would
shield
merrill
lynch
from
any
other
claim.
it
could
say
to
any
other
claimant:
sorry,
a
binding
judgment
has
been
issued
saying
this
matter
can't
be
settled
without
the
philippines
being
in
it.
so
i
don't
really
get
your:
merrill
lynch
is
going
to
be
subject
to
repeated
proceedings.
they
will
be
armed
with
a
judgment
that
says,
suit
can't
go
on
without
the
philippines
being
there.
