mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
sovereign
government
cannot
be
made
a
party
to
a
case
because
of
its
immunity
from
suit,
that
fact
must
be
given
great
weight
in
determining
whether
the
suit
nonetheless
may
proceed.
that
is
true
whether
the
absent
sovereign
is
the
united
states,
one
of
the
50
states,
an
indian
tribe
or,
as
here,
a
foreign
state.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
believe
it
would
be
dispositive
in
most
cases,
we
think,
only
if
the
sovereign's
interests
would
be
adequately
protected
by
the
judgment
or
in
the
rare
case
that
we've
identified
in
our
brief
where
the
sovereign's
interests
are
adequately
protected
by
another
sovereign,
in
the
case
of
an
indian
tribe
being
protected
by
the
united
states.
but
other
than
that,
or
where
the
united
states
is
in
a
case
against
a
state,
the
united
states
being
the
national
sovereign,
there
could
be
special
circumstances,
but
we
think
as
a
whole,
the...
as
a
general
rule,
sovereign
immunity
controls.
and
that's
because
sovereign
immunity
represents
a
fundamental
policy
judgment
either
rooted
in
the
constitution
for
the
united
states
or
the
states,
or
judgments
of
the
legislative
branches
that
the
sovereign
should
not
be
required
to
appear
in
court.
a
contrary
rule
allowing
the
suit
to
proceed
would
effectively
undermine
that
rule
of
immunity
and
allow
the
sovereign's
interest
to
be
tried
behind
its
back.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that's
probably
correct
if
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
governs
the
service
of
process
under
the
act,
and
if
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
but
if
the
sovereign...
if
the
foreign
sovereign
can't
be
sued,
i
think
it's
all
the
more...
i
mean
it
can't
even
be
reached...
it
may
be
all
the
more
reason
why
that
interest
should
be
given
weight.
we
think
the
sovereign
interest
in
this
case
is
particularly
compelling
for
reasons
that
have
already
been
stated.
the
government
of
the
philippines
claims
that
it
owns
these
assets.
by
contrast,
the
respondents
are
unsecured
judgment
creditors.
the
government
of
the
philippines
claims
it
owns
these,
these
assets,
under
a
special
philippine
statute
dating
to
1955
that
declares
ill-gotten
gains
gained
toward...
during
time
in
office,
forfeit
to
the
government,
and
it
has
a
strong
interest
in
having
that
dispute
resolved
in
its
own
courts.
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
the
united
states
strongly
supports
that
position
and
that
interest
of
the
united
states
is
strongly
supported
by
the
fact
that
it
is
a
party
to
a
mutual
legal
assistance
treaty
with
the
philippines.
such
treaties
are
common
in
this
country.
there
is
a
comparable
treaty
between
the
philippines
and
the
swiss
government
which
led
to
the
repatriation
from
switzerland
to
the
philippines
of
a
large--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
the
philippines...
excuse
me.
the
philippine
national
bank
is
an
escrow
agent.
it
would
have
a
conflict
of
interest
in
representing
the
interests
of
the
government
of
the
philippines
with
respect
to
its
prior
claim
to
the
assets
as
against
the
marcos
estate.
pnb
is
holding
these
assets
in
escrow
pending
the
outcome
of
the
very
litigation
we
are
talking
about
in
the
philippines.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
true,
but
the
interests
of
the
philippine
government
in
obtaining...
in
having
its
interest
confirmed
that
it
owns
these
assets
as
of
the
time
of
the
wrongdoing
going
back
to
1972,
that
interest
would
not
be
advanced
by
pnb
because
pnb
is
holding
them
in
escrow
depending...
pending
the
outcome
of
that
very
dispute
between
the
marcoses
and
the
philippine
government
and
couldn't
be
expected
to
advance
in
this
case
the
government
of
the
philippines'
interest
or
claim
of
ownership
to
those
assets.
one
other
international
agreement
i
wanted
to
mention
was
the
convention
against
corruption,
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
and
also
there
is
a
statute
passed
by
congress,
2467,
that
provides
for
forfeiture
in
the
united
states
of
assets
that
are
deemed
to
be
forfeited
pursuant
to
a
foreign
proceeding.
so
international
agreements--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we...
we
don't
have
it
yet,
but
that...
that
reflects
the
important
interest
of
having
our
courts
stay
their
hands
pending
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings
in
the
philippines
in
which
that
would
be
determined.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what...
what
the
statute
requires
is
that
the
foreign
proceedings
be
in
accordance
with
due
process
and
that
parties
claiming
an...
an
interest
in
the
property
be
entitled
to
be
present.
again,
the
claimants
here
do
not
claim
an
interest
in
the
property
as
an
owner.
they
are
unsecured
judgment
creditors
of
the...
of
the
marcos
estate,
and
it...
it
might
be
useful
to
think
about
what
is
true
in
the
reverse
situation,
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding
brought
by
the
united
states
in
u.s.
courts
against
a
criminal
defendant,
for
example.
an
unsecured
creditor
of
the...
of
the
defendant
claiming
the
assets
is
typically
found
not
even
to
have
standing
to
intervene.
but
if
it
does
intervene,
it
would
not
have
a
claim
superior
to
that
of
the
united
states
because
it
wouldn't
be
a
bona
fide
purchaser
of
the
assets,
and
it
wouldn't
be
without
knowledge
of
the
illegal
conduct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in...
in
u.s.
courts
a
secured
creditor
would
get
past
the
standing
stage,
but
would
not...
would
not
get
past
the
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value
without
knowledge
of
the
wrongdoing.
in
this
case
it
has
been
clear
since
1986,
for
example,
that
the
government
of
the
philippines
has...
has
been
seeking
the
repatriation
of
arelma
and
its
assets.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
perhaps
in
an
extreme
case,
but
i...
first
of
all,
i
think
the
courts
of
the
united
states
should
be
very
reluctant
to
deem
a
foreign
government's
conduct
inequitable
in
the
sense
that
you're
describing
it.
and
i
think,
for
the
reasons
mr.
rothfeld
said,
repatriating
these
assets
is
an
extremely
complicated
thing.
but
the
philippines
government
sought
these
assets
in...
beginning
in
1986,
obtained
a
freeze
order
in
1986,
again
in
1990.
it
got
a
final
determination
by
the
district
attorney
in
switzerland
in
1995,
confirmed
by
the
federal
court
of
switzerland
in
1997,
that
the
assets
could
be
returned.
these
assets,
the
shares,
the
arelma
shares,
however,
were
not
actually
returned
until
2000
by
the
swiss
government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
was
the
preliminary
injunction
and
i'm
not
sure
what
happened
after
that.
but
i
did
want...
the
proceedings
in
switzerland,
i
did
want
to
make
clear,
because
there
was
a
suggestion
that
the
philippine
government
was
duplicitous
by
encouraging
this
suit
and
at
the
same
time
seeking
the
assets.
but
as
i
just
pointed
out.
it
has
been
clear
since
1986
and
through
a
whole
series
of
proceedings
in
switzerland
and
in
the
philippines
that
the
government
of
the
philippines
has
been
claiming
all
of
the
marcos
assets,
specifically
including
the
arelma
assets--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
do
not
believe
so.
if
we
thought
about
an
analogy
at
the
united
states,
if
the
united
states
filed
a
brief
in
this
court
saying
that
a
former
government
official
could
be
sued,
did
not
have
qualified
immunity
and
could
be
sued
in
his
personal
capacity,
or
didn't...
or
could
be
sued
individually
and
the
westfall
act
did
not
protect
him,
that
would
in
no
way
make...
be
a
representation
by
the
united
states
that
a
judgment
against
that
officer
could
be
satisfied
out
of
assets
of
the
united
states,
including
assets
that
the
united
states
might
be
seeking
to
recover
from...
from
the
defendant.
and
we
think
the
philippine
government
is
in
essentially
the
same
position.
and
a
finding
of
liability
in
this
case...
the
judgment
does
constitute
a
finding
of
liability
so
that
with
respect
to...
it
would
give
these
respondents
here
the
ability
to
go
to
philippine
court,
to
file
a
claim
in
the
probate
proceedings
in
the
philippines
as
these
respondents
have
done.
so
the
judgment,
even
without
being
satisfied,
serves
the
respondents'
interests
to
a
great
extent.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice;
it's
been
a
great
honor.
