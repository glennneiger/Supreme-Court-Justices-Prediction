justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
issue
in
the
philippines
is
the
question
of
whether
the
money
that
went
into
the
stock
certificates
eventually
belonged
to
the
people
of
the
philippines
from
the
beginning
or
belonged
to
marcos
personally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
saying
that
there's
no
possibility
whatsoever
that
a
philippine
court
could
say
that
this
money
initially
belonged
to
the
people
of
the
philippines?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
saying
whether
they...
i
don't
care
what
the
name
of
the
proceeding
is.
i'm
saying
could
they
decide
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
they
decide
that,
why
should
your
clients,
terribly
treated
as
they
were,
get
the
money
ahead
of
the
victims
in
the
philippines,
who
also
were
terribly
treated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
justice
souter
just
answered
that.
he
said
that
the
stock
certificates
might
be
held
to
belong
to
the
people
of
the
philippines,
in
which
case
the
stock
certificates
represent
stock
in
a
company
that
has
a
claim
against
merrill
lynch,
and
so
they
will
say,
this
certificate
belongs
to
the
people
of
the
philippines;
the
people
of
the
philippines
would
like
you,
merrill
lynch,
to
pay
back
the
money
that
the
company
gave
them
initially.
and
merrill
lynch
i
imagine
would
pay
it.
now
that
i
think
is
as
i
understand
it.
is
there
something
wrong
with
my
understanding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
see
that
finding
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
they
belonged...
they
couldn't
possibly
belong
to
the
philippine
government
or
the
people
there,
because
there
is
no
way
that
the
philippine
government
could
win
in
a
suit
in
new
york
in
trying
to
recover
them.
but
the
solicitor
general
has
provided
about
two
or
three
ways,
in
which
and
so...
and
so
have
the
petitioners...
and
that
seems
to
me
the
heart
of
the
issue.
they
have
said:
no,
no,
there
are
two
or
three
ways
in
which
the
philippine
government
might
well...
it
might
well
ask
a
court
for
the
money
and
the
court
would
say,
yes,
you're
entitled
to
it.
so
that
it
seems
to
me,
that's
the
heart
of
it.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
well,
that
isn't
what
they
say.
i
think,
if
i
understand
it,
that
they
say
that
were
the
share
certificates
in
the
hands
of
the
philippine
government
on
the
ground,
that
the
money
used
to
create
those
had
been
taken
from
the
philippine
people
unlawfully,
if
that's
what
they
decide,
at
that
point
the
owner
of
the
certificates,
the
government,
would
say
to
merrill
lynch:
we
own
the
company,
the
company
has
the
assets;
please
send
us
the
money.
and
merrill
lynch
would
do
it.
but
if
merrill
lynch
didn't
do
it,
then
they
would
file
the
judgment
saying,
these
are
our
share
certificates,
in
the
new
york
court
and
say,
will
you
please
enforce
the
judgment.
now,
there
is
something
there
that
i'm
not
quite
getting
and
that's
why
i
want
you
to
respond
to
the
line
of
happenings
that
i
just
suggested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
huge
change.
the
change
would
be
that
they'd
a
judgment
of
that
special
court
over
there
that
this
company
and
the
assets
understandably
belong
to
us,
not
to
the
marcoses.
and
so
this
time,
they
go
with
that
judgment
to
merrill
lynch
and
say:
give
us
the
money.
and
if
they...
if
they
don't...
if
merrill
lynch
says
no...
merrill
lynch
might
say
yes,
but
you'll
say,
no,
it
belongs
to
us,
so
they
might
not.
and
if
they
don't,
then
the
philippines
are
never
going
to
get
the
money,
unless
they
bring
the
lawsuit.
and
once
they
bring
the
lawsuit,
then
you
have
them,
because
then
you
go
right
into
the
court
in
that
lawsuit
and
intervene
and
they
have
waived
all
their
sovereign
immunity,
et
cetera,
they
can't
get
the
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
with
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have...
i
mean
i
don't
see
you
have
a
claim
there
as
opposed
to
the...
the
worst
that
would
happen,
not
necessarily
good
for
your
clients,
but
the
worst
that
would
happen
would
be
that
the
assets
would
be
devoted
to
victims
and
their
families
in
the
philippines.
i
mean,
namely
to
the
philippine
people.
so
i
don't
see
some
kind
of
fundamental
unfairness
here,
unless
you
can
point
one
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
they'll
treat
you
like
another
creditor
and
you
have...
but
is
there
some
terrible
unfairness
going
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there...
is
there
something
special
going
on,
specially
unfair,
in
respect
to
the
delays
where
you
are
treated
differently
than
other
litigants
in
the
philippines?
