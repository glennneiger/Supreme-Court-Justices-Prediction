justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
didn't
hear
you.
you
said
that
this
dispute
should
be
settled
by--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
it
gets
way
ahead
of
the
analysis
and
probably
way
ahead
of
your
argument.
at
some
point
i'd
like
you
to
address
whether
or
not
one
of
the
equities
the
court
can
consider
is
the
likelihood
of
an
earlier
decision.
let's
assume
we
project
out
another
10
years.
does
that
make
a
difference?
that
may
come
toward
the
end
of
your
argument
rather
than
now,
but
i'd
like
it
addressed
at
some
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
address
that?
that
is
the
issue.
sovereign
immunity,
is
this
a
question
of
where
a
party
is
just
entitled
to
plead
inconsistent
theories?
was
this
a
special
appearance?
why
is
it
that
the
philippines
can
come
into
court
and
say,
"we
have
sovereign
immunity,
and
therefore
the
suit
must
be
dismissed?
"
would
you
just
address
that
basic
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
a
case...
and
you
have
to
do
a
lot
of
supposing.
suppose
that
the
philippine
government
was
simply
not
amenable
to
the
process
of
the
court,
not
because
of
foreign
immunity,
but
just
because
it
was
outside
the
geographic
area
where
process
ran.
it
just
can't
be
made
a
party.
exactly
the
same
analysis
as
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand,
but
in
my
hypothetical
case
it's
just
as
if
somebody
is
at
the
north
pole
and
you
can't
serve
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
difference
in
the
redo
is
that
in
the
second
case
that's
just
been
hypothesized,
the
philippine
government
is
represented.
we
are
making
these
assumptions,
and
the
philippines
government
says:
you
can
make
these
assumptions,
but
they
may
very
well
be
wrong;
we
want
to
be
represented
before
you
make
those
assumptions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
any
party
that's
beyond
the
process
of
the
court
has
a
right
to
come
in.
the
question
is
what
happens
if
they
are
not
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
making
that
balancing,
what
weight
did
they
give
to
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
philippines?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
common
problem
in
litigation
and
this
is
discussed
in
this
case
which
is
06-1204,
a
common
problem
of
litigation
is
the
question
of
which
persons
or
entities
must
be
joined
in
an
action
before
the
case
can
proceed.
and
suppose
there
are
persons
who
should
be
made
parties,
but
who
cannot
be
made
to
join,
does
this
mean
the
case
must
be
dismissed
or
may
the
litigation
proceed
without
them?
these
questions
of
joinder
in
civil
cases
in
federal
court
are
addressed
in
rule
19
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
in
this
case,
it
determines
on
--
turns
on
the
interpretation
of
proper
application
of
rule
19
in
the
particular
context
of
sovereign
immunity.
this
interpleader
action
was
commenced
to
determine
the
ownership
of
property,
the
property
was
held
by
merrill
lynch,
it
wanted
to
know
who
the
owner
was
so
it
commenced
this
interpleader
suit.
it
was
property
allegedly
stolen
by
ferdinand
marcos
when
he
was
president
of
the
republic
of
the
philippines.
alleged
crimes
and
misfeasance
by
marcos
during
his
presidency
became
the
subject
of
world
wide
attention
and
protest.
a
class
action
by
and
on
behalf
of
over
9,000
of
his
human
rights
victims
was
filed
against
marcos
and
his
estate
among
others
and
that
was
filed
in
the
united
states
courts.
these
parties
are
called
the
pimentel
class.
the
pimentel
class
obtained
a
judgment
for
nearly
$2
billion
and
the
interpleader
suit
that
the
pimentel
class
wants
to
execute
on
the
property
in
question,
property
held
by
merrill
lynch
in
partial
satisfaction
of
that
judgment.
two
other
entities
were
named
in
the
interpleader
suit
and
they
invoked
sovereign
immunity.
now,
those
entities
were
the
republic
of
the
philippines
and
the
philippine
presidential
commission
on
good
governance
and
we
refer
to
these
in
the
opinion
as
the
republic
and
the
commission.
they,
too,
claim
a
right
to
these
assets
and
litigation
on
their
claim
is
also
pending
in
the
philippine
courts.
now,
the
assets
here
in
question
here
were
last
valued
at
about
$35
million.
in
the
early
stages
of
the
interpleaderâ€™s
case,
the
republic
and
the
commission
were
dismissed
as
parties,
but
the
action
proceeded
without
the
sovereign
entities.
that
interpleader
action
resulted
in
a
ruling
that
the
pimentel
class
could
levy
on
the
assets
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
it
held
that
under
rule
19,
it
was
proper
to
allow
the
interpleader
action
to
proceed
even
though
the
sovereign
entities
were
not
parties.
in
this
court,
the
republic
of
the
philippines
together
with
other
petitioners
who
were
parties
to
the
suit
claimed
it
was
error
to
allow
the
action
to
go
forward
without
the
sovereign
entities.
in
their
view,
once
it
was
determined
that
the
republic
and
the
commission
could
not
be
joined,
the
action
should
have
been
dismissed.
we
agree
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
there
is
an
--
an
initial
question
whether
the
sovereign
entities
are
properly
in
this
court
when
they
were
dismissed
from
the
suit
in
the
trial
court.
other
parties,
however,
who
were
in
the
suit
and
who
appealed
the
judgment
joined
the
sovereign
entities
as
petitioners
in
the
case
now
before
us.
we
hope
that
they
can
pursue
the
matter,
they
can
raise
the
objections
made
by
the
sovereign
entities
for
if
the
interpleader
action
should
not
have
continued
then
all
of
the
petitioners
here
will
be
relieved
of
an
adverse
judgment.
now,
that
brings
us
to
the
rule
19
question.
now,
the
rule
has
various
factors
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
an
action
can
proceed
without
required
persons
and
the
opinion
discusses
these
factors.
here
it
suffices
to
say
that
the
first
factor
weighs
heavily
in
favor
of
the
republic
and
the
commission.
that
factor
considers
the
extent
to
which
the
absent
entities
are
prejudiced
by
a
judgment
if
the
case
proceeds
without
them.
the
court
of
appeals
found
little
or
no
prejudice
to
the
republic
or
to
the
commission
and
in
its
view
they
would
not
prevail
on
the
merits.
we
conclude
that
whether
or
not
the
sovereign
entities
would
prevail,
their
claim
was
not
a
frivolous
one
and
it
was
error
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
that
claim
when
the
sovereign
entities
were
in
the
suit.
but
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
this
ruling
was
itself
a
violation
of
the
sovereign
immunity
that
the
republic
and
the
commission
assert.
the
privilege
of
sovereign
immunity
is
codified
by
statute
and
the
comity
and
dignity
interests
that
contributed
to
the
development
of
the
sovereign
immunity
privilege
take
concrete
form
in
this
case.
the
claims
of
the
republic
and
the
commission
arise
from
events
of
historical
and
political
significance
for
the
republic
and
its
people.
the
republic
and
the
commission
have
a
unique
interest
in
resolving
the
ownership
of
or
claims
to
the
assets
and
in
determining
if
and
how
the
asset
should
be
used
to
compensate
those
persons
who
suffered
grievous
injury
under
marcos.
the
other
factors
listed
in
the
rule
are
either
inapplicable
or
weigh
as
well
in
favor
of
the
petitioners,
we
determine
that
this
action
must
be
dismissed.
this
leaves
the
pimental
class
which
has
waited
for
years
now
to
be
compensated
for
grievous
wrongs
with
no
immediate
way
to
recover
on
its
judgment
against
marcos
and
at
least
merrill
lynch,
the
stakeholder
who
wants
to
know
who
should
receive
the
assets
without
the
--
without
a
judgment.
the
balance
of
equities
may
change
in
due
course.
one
relevant
change
may
occur
if
it
appears
that
the
philippines'
court
cannot
or
will
not
issue
its
ruling
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
other
changes
could
result
when
and
if
there
is
a
ruling
in
that
case.
merrill
lynch
or
other
parties
may
then
seek
to
commence
further
litigation
in
light
of
changed
circumstances.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
remand
the
case
with
instructions
to
order
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
action.
