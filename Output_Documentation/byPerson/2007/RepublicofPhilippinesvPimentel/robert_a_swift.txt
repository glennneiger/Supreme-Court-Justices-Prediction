mr.
robert
a.
swift
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
as
a
first
point
the
issue
you
raise,
which
is
perhaps
seminal
to
you,
and
that
is
whether
there
is
an
adequate
alternative
remedy
to
the
human
rights
victims,
either
in
the
united
states
or
in
the
philippines.
our
answer
is,
unequivocally,
there
is
no
remedy.
let
me
talk
about
the
philippines
first.
any
forfeiture
proceeding
in
the
philippines
is
in
rem.
its
supreme
court
has
so
declared.
these
assets
are
in
the
united
states.
there
cannot
be
two
jurisdictions
that
share
in
rem
assets.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
that's
right.
switzerland
confiscated
those
certificates
from
a
swiss
financier
and
transferred
them
to
the
philippines.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
they
can,
and
that's
in
fact
what
is
occurring.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
however,
it's
also
apparent
from
the
facts
in
this
case
that
those
certificates
were
never
the
property
of
the
philippine
government,
never,
ever.
there
is
absolute
clear
evidence
in
this
record,
in
the
joint
appendix
on
that,
which
makes
the
whole
issue--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
that's--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--they
could
not
say
that
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding
because--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--yes,
sir,
absolutely.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
because
the
judgment
in
the
philippines
would
not
be
in
rem,
mr.
justice
breyer.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i
think
your
understanding
is
correct
in
that
regard;
however,
the
law
both
in
the
philippines
and
in
the
united
states
draws
a
clear
distinction
between
the
ownership
of
stock
and
a
corporation's
ownership
of
assets.
certainly
dole
v.
patrickson
stands
for
that
proposition.
the...
a
judgment
rendered
as
to
the
certificates
in
the
philippines
or
even
as
to
the
assets
would
not
be
in
rem.
so
if
that
judgment
came
over
to
the
united
states
to
be
enforced,
they
would
stand
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
judgment
creditor,
not
a
judgment
creditor
with
a
claim
to
specific
assets,
but
a
judgment
creditor
as
to
a
specific
amount
of
money.
let
me
answer
another
question
which
was
asked--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
interpleader
is,
statutory
interpleader,
is
an
in
rem
nature
of
a
proceeding.
in
fact,
it
was
the
best
and
most
appropriate
and
the
only
proceeding
in
which
all
claimants
could
be...
their
claims
could
be
heard.
it's
a
shame
that
the
philippine
government
didn't
come
in,
as
it
did
in
twelve
other
cases
it
brought
in
the
united
states,
including
two
interpleaders,
to
say:
yes
and
this
is
our
evidence.
what
it
suggests
is
that
they
had
no
evidence
to
support
it,
and
they
want
to
be
in
their
own
court.
why
do
they
want
to
be
in
their
own
court?
because
it
won't
be
defended
by
the
marcoses.
and
the
very
rule
that
they
cited
in
their
reply
brief...
and
by
the
way,
the
reply
brief
was
the
first
time
in
all
this
litigation
they
have
ever
asserted
that
the
human
rights
victims
have
a
remedy
by
intervening
in
the
sandiganbayan
in
the
philippines.
we
don't.
the
rule
that
they
quote
says
as
to
assets
in
the
court.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
your
honor
is
correct
that
there
was
an
underlying
belief
by
the
court,
that
the
court
accepted
as
valid
the
republic's
claim
that
it
owned
the
assets,
the
assets
were
stolen.
but
the
evidence
in
the
case,
and
the
two
lower
courts
specifically
found
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence,
that
these
were
marcos
assets;
and
this
finding
was
made
after
the
completion
of
discovery,
after
a
deposition
in...
in
france.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
not
the
latter
part
of
your
equation.
they
did
not
say
that
they
did
not
belong
to
the
philippine
government.
by
saying
they
belonged
to
ferdinand
marcos
it
was
sufficient,
it
was
sufficient
evidence.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i'd
like
to
go
through
each
way
in
which
they
say
they
can
and
convince
you
that
they
can't.
first,
they
could
proceed
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding
in
the
philippines.
but
of
course
that
wouldn't
be
in
rem,
so
they
couldn't
get
to
first
base
as
to
the
assets.
as
to
the
share
certificates,
yes,
but
of
course
that
in
effect
is
a
nullity
because
they
never
belonged
to
the
philippine
government.
that
aside,
we
put
aside
that
factual--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--because
ownership
of
the
share
certificates
is
not
a
right
to
the
assets,
a
per
se
right.
there
would
have
to
be
some
additional
rights.
the
assets
are
ones--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--that's
correct.
the
other
two,
two
types
of
proceedings,
one
could
be
a
conversion
and
one
breach
of
contract,
both
of
which
would
be
barred
by
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
an
important
fact
that
you
left
out
was
that
in
the
year
2000,
when
the
philippine
government
through
pnb
controlled
the
arelma
certificates,
a
request
to
merrill
lynch
was
made.
the
request
was
refused.
so
if
there
was
a
breach
it
occurred
in
the
year
2000.
remember,
after
the
certificates
were
transferred
from
switzerland
to
the
philippines
the
pnb
then
created
a
new
board
of
directors
and
they
went
directly
to
merrill
lynch.
the
whole
point
of
this
exercise
was,
of
course,
to
circumvent
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
i
only
learned
about
the
assets
in
the
year
2000
and
then
proceeded
to
try
to
recover
them.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
but
i
believe
there
is
an
important
part
of
the
equation
that's
left
out
of
that
question,
and
that
is
the
rights
of
the
philippine
government
as
the
new
shareholder
will
not
be
any
greater
than
those
of
the
prior
shareholder.
the
prior
shareholder
made
a
demand
and
did
not
receive
the
money.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
nothing
prevents
them
from
making
the
demand.
but
when
they
go
into
court
and
ask
for
that,
first
of
all,
merrill
lynch
can
do
what
it
did
here,
which
is
to
file
an
interpleader
and
say:
we
want
all
the
claimants
to
come
forth
and
make
the
claim.
then
we
have
a
redo.
what
we
have
below
is
a
judgment,
a
judgment
that
we're
seeking
to
enforce
and
we
contend
that--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
they
had
that
right
in
the
year
2000
when
they
chose
to
exercise
their
sovereign
immunity.
so,
what
has
changed?
they
would
have
to
waive
their
sovereign
immunity
to
go--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
they
were
brought
in.
they
chose
to
exit.
they
then
paid
for
the
prosecution
of
claims
by
pnb
and
arelma,
in
effect
acting
as
surrogate,
reflective
of
a
question
that
was
asked
earlier.
then
when
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
result,
they
then
want
to
use
pnb
and
arelma
to
upset
that
pursuant
to
a
rule
19(b)
motion.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
then
you
have
a
redo
of
what
they
started
out
this
proceeding
doing--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--which
was
judge
shopping
and
forum
shopping.
they
were...
they
were--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
is
that
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule
under
rule
19(b).
i
don't
believe
it's
the
role
of
this
court
to
change
rule
19(b).
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
then
we
have
two
lower
courts
that
have
balanced
and
weighed
all
appropriate
factors.
there
is
no
suggesting
that
there
are
other
factors.
they...
i
believe
that
the
standard
of
review
for
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
lower
courts
considered
the
factors
and
engaged
in
an
appropriate
balancing
and
weighing--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--significant
weight.
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
was
a
powerful
factor.
and
then
it
went
into
other
factors,
some
of
which
justice
ginsburg
mentioned:
the
22-year
delay.
they
have
known
about
this
for
a
long
time.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
let
me
pose
a
different
example
to
you,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
is,
what
if
this
were
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
the
foreign
sovereign
said:
oh,
those
assets
really
belong
to
us,
they
were
stolen,
and
we'll
decide
that
in
our
country.
now,
it
could
be
any
country
of
the
world.
would
the
u.s.
court
stand
for
that?
are
u.s.
courts
supposed
to
give
away
and
surrender
and
be
ousted
of
their
own
jurisdiction
in
in
rem
actions
and
farm
out
decisions
to
foreign
countries?
and
in
our
case
we're
not
even
going
to
be
represented,
nor
will
the
marcoses?
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
i
submit
that
the
underlying
principle
is
a
solid
one,
and
that
is
u.s.
courts
do
have
in
rem
jurisdiction.
we
have
28
u.s.c.
1655.
it's
one
of
the
oldest
forms
of
jurisdiction
we
have
in
this
country.
and
we
should
not
be
surrendering
that
to
a
foreign
sovereign
and
farming
out
per
decision
decisions
about
assets.
these
assets
are
not
transitory.
they
have
been
here
35
years.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
the
lower
court...
well,
not
as--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--it
has,
based
on
evidence,
based
on
depositions,
that
these
assets
belonged
to
marcos.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
i...
are
you
saying
that--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--there
are
a
number
of
findings,
but
obviously,
because
the
philippine
government
was
not
a
party
in
the
case,
there
was
no
finding
specific
to
the
philippine
government.
but
the
finding
that
they
were...
belonged
to
ferdinand
marcos
is
sufficient.
you
do
not
need
the
counter-finding
that
they
did
not
belong
to
the
republic.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
again,
that's
a
forfeiture
issue.
the
assets
have
to
be
in
the
philippines,
and
there
have
been
many
forfeiture
proceedings
in
the
philippines
as
to
marcos
assets.
to
answer
a
question
justice
kennedy
raised
earlier,
aren't
there
other
assets,
they've
have
already
recovered
over
a
billion
dollars
of
assets.
there
is
still
hundreds
of
millions,
if
not
a
billion,
in
the
philippines.
you
know,
from
the
record
and
what
i've
submitted,
that
we're
not
able
to
transfer
our
american
judgment
to
the
philippines.
the
united
nations
human
rights
committee
has
even
found
a
violation
of
international
law
by
the
republic
in
preventing
us
from
doing
that.
we've
had
to
go
to
that
body.
do
we
think
that
we
are
going
to
get
justice
in
a
philippine
court
that's
never
adjudicated
human
rights
violation,
much
less
our
right
to
the
assets?
think
how
easy
it
would
be
for
the
marcoses
and
the
philippine
government
to
simply
make
a
deal
as
to
these
assets.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
then
we
run
into
such
issues
like
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
and
we
have...
then
we
will...
our
defense
will
be
undermined
because
they
will
say
a
u.s.
court
cannot
re-examine
those...
that
determination.
so
it's
a
catch-22
for
us.
we
proceeded
as
we
were--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
i--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--what
your
honor
is
suggesting
is
that
a
useful
approach
to
this
case
is
to
say,
well,
if
the
philippine
government
gets
the
money,
then
won't
that
benefit
everybody?
well,
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
characteristic
of
the
country,
something
i'm
very
familiar
with
but
which
i
don't
want
to...
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
in
this
proceeding
to
talk
about.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
yes.
there
was
purposeful
delay
in
us
being
able
to
transfer
our
judgment.
we
are
just
in
the
pleadings
stage
after
11
years
there.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
i
think
the
issue
was
resolved
pursuant
to
19(b).
unless
this
court
determines
that
there
is
a
per
se
rule
under
19(b),
we
weigh
factors,
and
it's
the
role
of
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was...
the
lower
courts
did
not
make
a
decision
based
on
equity
and
good
conscience,
one
of
the
broadest
parameters
of
decisionmaking
provided
by
a
lower
court.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
our
judgment
has
not
been
enforced.
they
asked...
initially
asked
for
a
filing
fee
of
$8.4
million.
we
appealed
that,
after
eight
years
and
some
months.
they
finally
said,
yes,
the
filing
fee
is
$10.
so,
it
was
sent
back
down
where
there
was
still
more
delay.
i
mean,
i'm
a
realist.
i
mean,
how
many
years
is
it
going
to
take?
mr.
robert
a.
swift
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
and
the
u.n....
the
united
nations
human
rights
committee
has
so
found.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
it
was
sua
sponte
with
the...
actually
raised
with
the
marcoses
initially,
and
the
court
simply
said
yes,
it's
$8.4
million.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
that's...
you're
correct
in
your
analysis.
the...
except
there
was
another
provision
of
the
fee
statute
which
we
went
under
and
which
they
ultimately...
the
philippine
supreme
court
said
that
we
were
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
absolutely
not.
we
think
that
argument
is
definitive.
first,
on
one
hand,
with
regard
to
the
philippine
government
and
its
pcgg:
they
were
not
parties
to
the
judgment.
therefore
under
karcher,
marino,
devlin--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--that's
true,
but
we've
also
pointed
out
that
arelma
and
pnb
have
thrown
in
the
towel
as
to
the
merits.
remember,
they're
parties
that
are
separate
parties.
they
had
claims
on
the
merits.
their
claims
were
resolved
against
them
inter
se,
and
so
they
no
longer
have
a
dog
in
the
fight.
mr.
robert
a.
swift
well,
perhaps
under
rule
19(b)
the
lower
court
may
still
rule
that
there
is
a...
a
definitive
judgment
as
to
them
against
other
creditors.
and
in
fact
that...
there
has
been--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
that's
perhaps
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
justice
ginsburg.
i
submit
to
you
that
the...
the
decision
i
would
respectfully
request
you
look
at
is
horizon
bank
and
trust
company
versus
massachusetts,
where
the
same
facts
occurred.
the
first
circuit...
massachusetts
did
the
same
thing
the
republic
of
the
philippines
did
here.
it
did
the
two-step
dance:
we're
sovereign,
we're
indispensable.
it
was
denied
by
the
lower
court.
the
lower
court
then,
since
the
united
states
was
a
party
and
the
state
didn't
have
immunity
as
to
that,
it
went
into
the
merits
determination.
massachusetts
appealed
only
appealed
only
the
19(b)
decision.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
because
they
had
not
appealed
the
merits
decision,
the
same
as
here,
therefore,
there
was
no
longer
a
live
controversy,
and
live
controversy
is
a
requirement
of
standing
in
this
court,
or
power
to
appeal
in
this
court.
so,
in
addition,
although
there
isn't
a
lot
of
case
law
in
this
court
on
this
particular
point,
i
would
refer
you
to
the
ashcroft
v.
mattis
decision
because
the
same
principle
was
applied
there
where
there
was
no
appeal
permitted
to
this
court.
finally,
the
one
thing
that
i
have
not
really
addressed
is
merrill
lynch's
interest.
the
whole
nature
of
"interpleader"
is
that
the
stakeholder
should
have
an
adequate
remedy.
merrill
lynch
has
significant
business
interests,
as
do
many
banks,
many
insurance
companies,
in
getting
a
resolution.
this
matter,
in
itself,
has
gone
on
for
eight
years.
there
have
been
over
a
dozen
appeals
in
this
particular
piece
of
litigation.
doesn't...
isn't
there
a
significant
business
interest
that
has
to
be
weighed
in
that
equation
so
that
merrill
lynch...
only
a
stakeholder
will
continue
to
have
to
defend,
defend,
defend,
interplead
and
so
forth?
i
submit
to
you
that
there
is
a
policy
judgment
that
has
to
be
made
by
this
court
as
to
the
rules
with
regard
to
interpleader
and
in
rem
proceedings
and
whether
this
court
is
prepared
to
surrender
jurisdiction
to
foreign
courts
to
make--
mr.
robert
a.
swift
--well,
let
me...
let
me
take
you
on,
on
that
point.
we
have
one
other
remedy,
and
that
is
execution.
execution
doesn't
require
joinder
of
all
parties.
it's
a
singular
proceeding
that
people
can
join
in,
but
we
would
have
the
right
to
execute,
and
you
can
bet
that
that
is
exactly
what
we
will
do.
so,
to
some
extent,
what
is
being
argued
here
is
somewhat
besides
the
point
because
if
that
money
goes
back
to
merrill
lynch,
we
can,
and
will,
execute
on
that.
