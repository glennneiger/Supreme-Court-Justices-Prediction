mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
a
dispute
over
the
ownership
of
the
property,
the
arelma
assets,
that
the
republic
of
the
philippines
believes
were
stolen
by
ferdinand
marcos
while
he
served
as
the
republic's
president.
the
ownership
of
this
property
should
be
settled
by
the
courts
of
the
republic.
the
arelma
assets
were
stolen
in
the
philippines,
from
the
philippine
people,
by
their
former
president.
the
current
dispute
is
between
the
republic
and
certain
of
its
citizens.
there
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--by
the
courts
of
the
republic.
the
question
of
ownership
of
these
assets
we
believe
is
a
matter
as
certainty
of
as
the
first
impression
should
be
decided
in
the
republic.
as
i
say,
the
assets
here
were
stolen
in
the
republic,
from
the
republic's
citizens,
by
their
president.
there
is
currently
a
proceeding
pending
before
the
sandiganbayan,
the
special
philippine
anti-corruption
court
that
has
jurisdiction
over
matters
of
this
sort,
dealing
specifically
with
the
assets
that
are
at
issue
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it's
been
pending...
well,
the
republic
initially
filed
a
forfeiture
petition
in
1991
directed
at
a
range
of
assets
related
to
former
president
marcos.
ultimately,
after
the
assets
were
transferred
from
switzerland
to
be
held
in
escrow
in
the
philippines,
the
philippine
supreme
court
in
2003
issued
a
judgment
relating
to
those
assets
because
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
whether
that
judgment,
some
question
about
whether
that
judgment
specifically
addressed
the
arelma
assets
that
are
at
issue
here,
the
republic
filed
a
motion
before
the
sandiganbayan
in
2004
directed
specifically
at
the
assets.
the
motion
has
been
pending
since
that
time.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
has
been,
your
honor.
the
republic...
that
delay
cannot
be
attributed
to
the
republic.
the
republic
has
filed
five
motions
with
the
sandiganbayan
urging
it
to
expedite
its
decision.
i
can
tell
you
that
it
has
a...
it
is
a
court
with
a
very
substantial
docket.
the
division
of
the
sandiganbayan
that's
considered
this,
these
assets,
considered
among
many
other
cases
the
corruption
trial
of
former
president
joseph
estrada.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
delay
can
at
this
point
be
deemed--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
certainly
will,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
make
sense
logically
to
consider
the
issues
that
we
think...
there
really
are
two
related
sets
of
considerations
that
should
go
into
the
court's
decision
as
to
whether
this
suit
should
be
dismissed,
which
is
our
submission.
one
relates
to
the
republic's
sovereign
immunity.
the
second
relates
to
kind
of
a
broader
set
of
considerations
and
i
think
that
your
question
goes
to
those.
so
i'll
turn
first
to
the
sovereign
immunity
question.
the
republic
asserts
ownership
of
these
assets.
its,
its
submission
is
that
president
marcos
misappropriated
them
while
he
served
as
the
president
of
the
republic.
if
that
is
true,
then
under
philippine
law
these
assets
at
all
times
were
the
property
of
the
republic.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
not,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
that
there
is
in
fact
no
inconsistency
at
all.
the
republic's
position
at
that
time
was
that
it
had
no
objection
to
plaintiffs
who
were
victims
of
the
marcos
regime
bringing
suit
in
the
united
states
and
they
had
no...
the
republic
had
no
objection
to
the
suit
proceeding
in
this
country.
specifically
the
issue
that
was
before
the
court
that
the
republic
weighed
in
on
was
whether
the
act
of
state
doctrine
would
preclude
adjudication
in
the
united
states.
the
republic's
interest
was
in
making
clear
that
the
acts
of
marcos
were
not
the
acts
of
the
republic,
they
were
not
official
acts
that
the
republic
was
prepared
to
defend.
the
republic
did
not
then
and
does
not
now
have
any
objection
to
citizens
of
the
republic
proceeding
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
against
the
estate
of
marcos.
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
these
assets
are
in
the
estate
of
marcos.
the
republic's
submission
is
that
these
assets
belong
to
the
republic,
that
they
have
never
been
part
of
the
marcos
estate,
and
that
therefore
these
are
sort
of
ships
passing
in
the
night,
that
there
can
be
proceedings
against
the
estate
in
this
country
or
elsewhere.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
is
litigation
going
on
in
the
philippines
now
before
the
sandiganbayan
as
to
what
is
in
the
estate,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems,
of
course,
is
that,
as
is
true
of
many
corrupt
regimes
that
have
misappropriated
state
assets,
unraveling
it
is
enormously
complicated.
there
were
dummy
corporations,
there
were
smell
corporations,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
has
taken
so
long.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
there
are
some
assets.
i
will
not
say
that
they
are
very
substantial
number
of
assets.
now,
i
should
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
there
are
not
and
there
may
never
have
been.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
is
not
an
entirely
fair
summary,
your
honor.
i
think...
and
again
let
me
say
that
there
are
two
separate
questions:
one
is
whether
or
not,
as
a
matter
of
principle,
the
philippines
objected
to
its
citizens
proceeding
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
condemn
the
regime
of
former
president
marcos.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
the
submission...
and
the
question
is
whether
there
is
some
inconsistency
between
what
the
republic
said
then
and
what
it
says
now.
the
submission
then
was
not
that
the
claimants
were
entitled
to
recover
assets
that
belonged
to
the
republic.
the
submission
was
that
whatever
ended
up
in
the
marcos
estate--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
that...
again,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
i
think
that
there
was
real
meaning
to
the
judgment
that
was
returned
here
even
if
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
there
are
assets
in
the
marcos
estate.
there
were
two
settlements
worked
out
between
the
marcos
estate
and
the
claimants,
with
the
blessing
of
the
republic,
that
would
have
paid
a
very
substantial
amount
out
of
assets
recovered
from
the
marcos...
that
were
associated
with
marcos,
recovered
by
the
republic,
and
the
republic
sort
of
blessed
payment
of
those
to
the
claimants
here.
ultimately
that
was
vetoed
by
the
sandiganbayan
as
inconsistent
with
philippine
law.
but
i
think
that
the
executive
branch--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--there
have
been
a
number
of
efforts
in
the
philippine
congress,
and
there
is
now
pending
bills
in
the
philippine
congress,
to
compensate
the
claimants
in
amounts
equivalent
to
those
settlements.
so
i
think
that
that
is
something
that
could
happen,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
step
back
and
say,
what
is
the
issue
before
this
court
here?
and
i
think
all
of
these
considerations
are
simply
divorced
from
the
rule
19
issues.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
we
quoted
the
relevant
portion
of
philippine
law,
which
is
equivalent
to
our
permissive
intervention,
which
would
have
permitted
the
claimants
to
seek
to
intervene
in
the
proceeding
of
the
sandiganbayan.
in
fact--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
is
not
a
matter
of
right;
it
is
permissive
intervention.
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
status
of
the
claimants,
though,
because
they're...
their
rights
are
entirely
derivative
of
the
marcos
estate.
they
don't
claim
the
arelma
assets,
which
are
the
subject
of
this
here
before
this
court.
if
the
marcos
estate
is
held
to
have
no
right
to
those
assets,
they
have
no
right
at
all
and
they
have
no
rights
to
be
protected.
so
i
think
it's...
it
is
important
to
retreat
to
the
questions
that
are
actually
before
this
court
now
about
the
meaning
of
rule
19
and
its
application
in
a
situation
in
which
there
is
an
absent
sovereign
that
has
asserted
its
sovereign
immunity.
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
that's...
sovereign
immunity
and
dismissal
under
rule
19
are
two
different
but
closely
related
and
essential
aspects
of
the
relief
of
the
republic.
as
a
matter
of
the
sovereign
immunity,
all
agree
at
this
point
that
it
cannot
be
forced
to
appear
in
this
proceeding.
but
that
relief
is
of
little
good
to
the
republic
if
the
assets
are
then
going
to
be
awarded
by
a
u.s.
court
to
someone
else
and
they
are
dissipated
and
they're
gone
forever.
and
so
it's
necessary
to
protect
its
interest,
its
sovereign
immunity,
to
make
it...
to
effectuate
it...
that
the
action
be
dismissed
under
rule
19.
and
i
think
that
it
is
something
which
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
there
is
a
sovereign
that
cannot
be
brought
into
the
litigation
and
the
sovereign's
interests
are
going
to
be
substantially
undermined,
the
sovereign
is
an
indispensable
party
and
dismissal
is
essentially
automatic.
that's
what
should
have
happened
here.
that's
the
first
mistake
that
the
district
court
made.
and
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me
amend
your
question
in
one
respect.
they
were
a
party
and
of
course
as
in
their...
in
their
capacity
as
a
party,
they
sought
dismissal
under
rule
19
as
well
as
dismissal
of
themselves
on
sovereign
immunity
grounds.
but
to
answer
specifically--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--they
were
not
there
for
the
adjudication
of
the
merits,
that's
right,
because
they
had
asserted
their
sovereign
immunity.
i
think
that
there...
everyone
agrees,
the
ninth
circuit
itself
acknowledged,
that
once
the
assets
here
are
disbursed
to
respondent
and
to
the
plaintiff
class,
as
a
practical
matter
they
will
be
beyond
recapture.
there
is
a
class
of
almost
10,000
people.
and
when
the
assets
are
gone,
to
reclaim
them,
even
if
the
sandiganbayan
rules
next
week
that
arelma
is
now
and
always
has
been
the
property
of
the
republic,
it
will
be
as
a
practical
matter
impossible
to
get
them
back.
one
suggestion
which
is
made
by
respondent
and
by
some
of
its
amici
is
that,
because
the
republic
is
not
bound
here,
it
could
bring
an
action
against
the
former
stakeholder
of
these
assets,
merrill
lynch.
that,
i
think,
is
also
clearly
an
inadequate
remedy
for
the
republic.
there
is
no
guarantee
that
it
would
be
able
to
proceed
in
such
a
proceeding
sort
of
unencumbered
by
the
judgment
here.
and
if
what
we
are
looking
for
under
rule
19...
again,
there
are
sort
of
two
components
to
this:
there
is
the
sovereign
immunity
component,
which
we
think
is
essentially
a
per
se
rule
requiring
dismissal
in
circumstances
here.
if
we
get
beyond
that
and
we
say,
under
rule
19
what
are
the
interests
that
we
want
to
advance,
the
principal
interest
of
rule
19
is
that
everything
gets
accommodated
in
a
single
proceeding,
that
this
gets
resolved
by
the
whole,
as
the
court
has
described
it,
and
the
only
way
to
accomplish
that
is
dismissal
of
this
suit.
if
this
action
is
dismissed,
the
court's
judgment
that
the
republic
is
an
indispensable
party
in
litigation
relating
to
arelma
will
be
binding
on
all
the
participants
to
this
litigation.
that
will
mean
that
if
anybody
sues
the
former
stakeholder
merrill
lynch
in
the
future,
that
action
will
be
dismissed
unless
or
until
the
republic
chooses.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
don't
think
it's
directly
relevant,
but
i
think
that
if
one
looks
at
the
bigger
picture,
it
is
true...
if
the
republic...
if
this
action
is
dismissed,
the
sandiganbayan
rules,
and
let's
say
that
it
rules
for
the
republic,
the
republic
becomes
the
owner
of
arelma.
it
is
then
in
a
position
to
go
to
merrill
lynch
and
say:
this
is
our
account;
give
it
to
us.
if
merrill
lynch
declines
to
do
that,
it
is
true
the
republic
will
have
to
seek
judicial
action
in
the
united
states,
but
at
that
point
it
will
be
seeking
to
enforce
a
judgment
of
the
sandiganbayan.
it...
the
proceeding
there
will
be
an
enforcement
action.
and
having...
it
being
armed
with
that
judgment
and
having
the
philippine
courts,
which
should
be
the
ones
that
resolve
this
as
a
matter
of
first
instance,
it
will
be
an
entirely
different
kind
of
proceeding.
and
in
that
proceeding,
unlike
this
one...
as
i
said,
the
other
side
says:
well,
you
know,
not
to
worry
here,
because
you
could
sue
merrill
lynch.
but
that's
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
rule
19,
which
is
to
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
if
the
sandiganbayan
rules
for
the
republic,
the
assets
are
the
republic's
assets.
the
republic
can
seek--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it
did
without
the
participation
of
the
philippines.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
but
the...
but
again,
your
honor,
it's
important
to
remember
the
private
claimants
have
no
claim
to
the
arelma
assets.
their
interest
is
entirely
derivative
of
the
marcos
estate.
the
estate--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it
goes,
i
think,
to
the
question
of
whether
their
claim
is
one
which
is
entitled
to
be
heard
in
the
united
states.
the
question
is,
when
the
sandiganbayan
decides
this
case
as
between
the
two
claimants
that
actually
claim
ownership
of
arelma,
as
opposed
to
derivative
rights
as
to
one
or
the
other
of
the
claimants,
that
is
the
way
in
which
it
makes
sense
to
proceed:
have
the
sandiganbayan
decide
as
between
these
two
claimants,
the
republic
and
the
estate.
once
that's
done,
all
else
follows
from
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think...
i
would
say
probably
not,
your
honor,
because
again
their
interests
are
entirely
derivative
of
the
marcos
estate.
and
so
i
think
they
may
be
thought
to
be
in
privity
with
the
estate,
and
therefore,
they
would
not
have
a
sort
of
separate
right
to
challenge
that.
but
i
think
that
we
should
not
anticipate
what
the
future
litigation
will
look
like
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
i
do
not
suggest
any
connection
between
them.
my
only
suggestion
is
that,
because
their
interest
is
entirely
derivative
of
the
estate,
the
estate
has
an
interest
in
defending
its
interest
there,
and
therefore
somebody
is
there
litigating
the
question.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
estate
has
a...
as
i
say,
these
assets
have
been
moved
around
or
hidden.
i
think
the
estate
may
well
have
an
interest
in
keeping
them
intact
and
saying
that
it
does
have
rights.
but
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
republic
has
a
substantial
interest
in
the
assets
that
are
at
stake
here.
and,
therefore,
its
sovereign
immunity,
at
least
in
the
context
of
this
case,
should
be
dispositive
and
should
have
led
to
dismissal
under
rule
19.
there...
this
court
in
the
provident
case
noted
that
there
are
certain
compelling,
substantive
considerations
that
are
dispositive
under
rule
19
that
make
it
unnecessary
to
consider
any
other
balancing
consideration.
sovereign
immunity
is
one
such
consideration.
and
because
the
republic
has
immunity,
has
asserted
immunity--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
it
gave
it
no
weight
at
all.
i
think
it
said
that,
yes,
in
theory,
sovereign
immunity
is
entitled
to
weight.
but
in
this
case
we
are
going
to
ignore
it
completely
because
we
believe
that
if
the
republic
appears
in
new
york
and
asserts
its
interests,
it
will
lose
under
statute
of
limitation
grounds.
that
is
a
completely
inappropriate
way
of
treating
it.
once
the
sovereign
immunity
was
asserted
and
there
was
a
substantial
interest
in
the
asset
here,
as
there
undoubtedly
was,
that
should
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
second
point
is
there
is
no
question
that,
ultimately,
this
is
a
dispute
between
the
marcos
estate
and
the
republic.
there
is
no
question
that
the
claims
of
the
respondents
here
are
entirely
derivative
of
the
marcos
estate;
and,
therefore,
that
is
something
that
has
to
be
decided
first:
whether
this
belongs
to
the
estate,
the
respondents,
or
the
republic.
and
that
is
a
determination
that
should
be
made
in
the
courts
of
the
philippines.
it
is
not
a
question
of
surrendering
the
jurisdiction
of
u.s.
courts.
there
is
a
general
consensus
that
stolen
assets,
assets
stolen
by
corrupt
leaders,
should
be
returned
to
the
nation
of
origin,
and
determination
as
to
ownership
should
be
made
by
the
courts
of
that
nation.
that's
stated
on
the
u.n.
convention
on
corruption
to
which
the
u.s.
and
the
philippines
are
a
party.
all
of
the
nations
that
have
an
interest
in
the
relevant
assets,
not
only
the
republic
but
the
united
states
and
switzerland,
all
agreed
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
sandiganbayan
to
make
that
determination
as
between
the
republic
and
the
estate.
if
it's
ruled
for
the
estate,
the
respondent
can
attempt
to
collect
as
a
judgment
creditor.
if
it
goes
to
the
republic,
the
republic
can
assert
its
interest
directly
with
merrill
lynch
as
the
owner
of
arelma.
if
merrill
lynch
declines
to
pay,
it
can
in
a
number
of
ways
try
to
enforce
its...
either
with
the
assistance
of
the
united
states
according
to
u.s.
statute,
in
which
case
the
sandiganbayan's
factual
determinations
would
be
dispositive,
or
it
can
bring
an
action
under...
under
new
york
law.
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
there
could
be
a
single
proceeding
that
resolves
everybody's
interests.
in
this
proceeding,
as
all
agree,
the
republic
is
free,
for
whatever
it
is
actually
worth,
to
sue
merrill
lynch.
that
is
precisely
what
rule
19
is
designed
to
avoid,
duplicative
litigation,
the
possibility
of
duplicative
liability.
if
the
sandiganbayan
rules,
the
republic
comes
here
and
initiates
an
action,
everybody
who
has
a
claim
can
be
brought
into
that
action.
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
there
is
no
possibility
that
merrill
lynch
could
be
subjected
to
duplicative
liability
because
this
court's
judgment
would
determine
that
the
republic
is
an
indispensable
party.
