mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
would
the
case
be
different
if
there
were
secured
creditors
rather
than
judgment
creditors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
ask
a
sort
of...
maybe
it's
too
elementary
a
question,
but
has
any
court
ever
decided
the
merits
of
the
question
whether
the
marcos
estate
or
the
philippine
government
owns
these
assets?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
decided
there
was
no
remedy,
i
understand
that.
but
has
it
decided
the
merits
of
the
basic
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
agree
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave
sovereign
immunity
great
weight
in
the
balancing?
