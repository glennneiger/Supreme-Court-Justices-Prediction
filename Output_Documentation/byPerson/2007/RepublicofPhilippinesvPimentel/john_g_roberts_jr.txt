chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-1204,
republic
of
the
philippines
v.
pimentel,
et
al..
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
couldn't...
why
couldn't
the
philippines,
not
having
been
a
party
in
this
action,
pursued
whoever
did
get
the
assets
from
this
action--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
normal
litigation,
if
they
objected
to
the
resolution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
they
weren't
there
for
the
adjudication
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
it...
is
it
fair
to
the
private
claimants
here
in
the
united
states
to
say,
wait
until
the
philippine
court
renders
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
philippines,
and
then
they
can
come
in
and
enforce
the
judgment
against
merrill
lynch
or
whomever
is
holding
the
assets?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
under
the
determination
of
the
philippine
court.
but
the
court
here
could
determine
that
they're
the
private
claimants'
assets,
as
it
did.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
just
told
me
that
the
philippines
court
may
judge
the
opposite
without
the
participation
of
the
private
claimants.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
argument
on
the
merits,
rather
than
with
respect
to
which
case
should
proceed
first.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
the
private
claimants
be
able
to
undermine
the
added
force
of
the
judgment
in
the
philippines,
assuming
a
proceeding
is
brought
here,
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
participate
in
the
proceeding
in
the
philippines?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler,
getting
back
to
your
previous
point,
why
isn't
the
philippine
national...
why
don't...
why
doesn't
the
philippine
national
bank
adequately
represent
the
interest
of
the
republic?
under
philippine
law,
as
i
understand,
any
recovery
by
the
bank
in
this
case
would
be
the
property
of
the
philippines.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
are...
they're
certainly
subject
to
philippine
law,
and
i
understand
that
there's
no
dispute
that
under
philippine
law
the
assets
would
be
taken
from
the
philippine
national
bank
for
the
benefit
of
the
government.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
swift.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
might
be
a
different
situation
in
your
hypothetical
with
respect
to
bankruptcy.
in
effect,
there's
an
administrator
against
whom
the
philippines
could
proceed,
unlike
the
situation
here,
where
you
have
a
class
and
which
the
prospect
of
the
philippines
proceeding
later
is
not
realistic.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
aren't
those
issues
that
could
be
addressed
when
the
philippines
attempt
to
enforce
a
judgment
they
would
get
in
the
philippines
if
they
do
in
fact
get
such
a
judgment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
before
you
sit
down,
you
haven't
mentioned
anything
about
your
argument
that
the
philippines
don't
have
the
right
to
raise
this.
are
you
throwing
in
the
towel
on
that
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
philippines
national
bank
and
arelma
were,
and
of
course
they've
appealed.
and
i
understand
the
law
to
be
they
can
raise
these
arguments.
we
don't
have
need
to
have
an
independent
basis
for
the
philippines.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
the
case
is
submitted.
but
counsel
are
not
excused.
mr.
kneedler
if
you
could
return
to
the
lecturn
for
a
moment.
mr.
kneedler,
our
records
reflect
that
you
have
now
presented
oral
argument
before
this
court
in
100
cases,
beginning
with
your
first
argument
in
october,
1979.
you
are
the
first
to
reach
this
rare
milestone
this
century.
on
behalf
of
this
court,
i
extend
to
you
our
appreciation
for
the
many
years
of
advocacy
and
service
to
the
court
during
your
tenure
in
the
office
of
solicitor
general.
we
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
many
times
in
the
future.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
counsel
are
excused.
