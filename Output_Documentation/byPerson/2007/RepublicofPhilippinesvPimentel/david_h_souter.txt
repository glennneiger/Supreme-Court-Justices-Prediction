justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
a
slightly
different
question
from
justice
scalia's.
is
it
the
position
of
the
philippine
government
that
there
are
any
assets
in
the
estate
that
the
philippine
government
does
not
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
enough
assets
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
the
individuals
who...
who
brought
suit
in
the
united
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
position
of
the
philippines,
going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
was
we
have
no
objection
and
in
fact
i
think
it
was
we
support
the
litigation
in
the
united
states,
but
when
it
comes
time
to
collect
a
judgment
we're
claiming
they
don't
get
a
penny
because
everything
belongs
to
us.
is
that
a
fair
summary
of
the
philippines'
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
weren't
just
suing
to
condemn
the
regime.
they
weren't
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
they
were
asking
for
a
judgment
in
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we
live
in
a
practical
world
and
if
in
fact
there
were
no
apparent
assets
that
might
satisfy
that
judgment
that
the
philippine
government
did
not
claim,
then
their...
then
their
support
of
the...
of
the
earlier
litigation
was
at
the
very
least
in
tension
with
their...
with
their
overall
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
doesn't
the
republic
take
the
position
that,
because
that
was
vetoed
for
reasons
apart
from
the
republic's
discretion,
that
the
current
assets
would
be
an
appropriate
source
of
payment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
been
doing
it
on
a
fairly
sporadic
basis.
if
i
remember
the
facts
correctly,
first
it
got
a
stay
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
assets,
and
then
the
stay
expired
and
the
government
didn't
do
anything
about
it,
and
then
the
government
didn't
come
into
action
again
until
this
particular
claim
was
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe...
let
me
put
the...
sort
of
my
response
in
the
form
of
a
question.
in
drawing
or
refusing
to
draw
the
conclusion
of
"indispensable
party",
do
you
claim
that
a
court
may
or
may
not
consider
the
equitable
or
inequitable
behavior
of
the
government?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
maybe
they
have
been
have
been
candid
about
their
claims,
but
they...
in
real-world
practical
terms,
the
claim
to
these
assets
and
the
representation
at
the
same
time
that
it's
appropriate
for
these
people
to
proceed
in
the
united
states
for
a
money
judgment,
are
at
least
in
some
tension
with
each
other,
aren't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
the...
maybe
this
makes
no
difference,
but
doesn't
the
philippine
national
bank
have
the...
whatever
they
call
them,
the
share
certificates
or
stock
certificates
that
represent
the
arelma
assets
at
this
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
couldn't
they...
couldn't
they
bring
an
in
rem
in
the
philippines
based
on
the
presence
in
the
philippines
of
those
two
certificates?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
wait
a
minute.
i
missed
your
last
step.
if
it's
an
in
rem
proceeding
against
the
share
certificates
what...
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
they
ever
belonged
to
the
philippines?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
an
in
rem
proceeding
against
the
certificates
simply
will
not
resolve
the
issue;
that's
the...
that's
the
guts
of
the
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
though.
merrill
lynch
refused
in
the
year
2000,
but
if
the
proceeding
that
justice
breyer
has
just
been
describing
takes
place
and
there
is
a
judgment
to
the
effect
that
the
share
certificates
are
properly
held
or
the
property
of
the
philippine
government,
and
the
philippine
government
now
makes,
or
then,
makes
a
new
request
to
merrill
lynch,
the
fact
that
they
made
a
request
that
was
refused
in
2000,
which
may
be
too
late
to
sue
on,
isn't
going
to
prevent
them
from
suing
on
their
present
adjudication
that
they
are
the
true
owners
of
the
share
certificates
and
want
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
you're
saying...
i
think
you're
saying
that
the
demand
would
be
ineffectual
this
time
for
the
same
reason
it
was
ineffectual
the
last
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
suggestion
i
thought
that
justice
breyer
had
made
and
that
i
made
was
this
time
they
can
do
something
further.
they
can
take
the
judgment
and
go
into
a
united
states
court
and
say:
we've
got
this
judgment,
there's
no
question
that
these
shares
and
what
they
represent
are
ours;
so
make
merrill
lynch
give
us
the
money.
what
prevents
them
from
doing
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
on
exactly
that
point
on
the
equity
to
justice
breyer's
last
question?
i
thought
you
had
given
or
anticipated
his
question
in
something
you
said
a
moment
ago,
and
then
you
didn't
repeat
it,
and
i
may
have
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
had
told
us
that
the
courts
of
the
philippines
did
not
recognize,
for
enforcement
purposes
there,
the
judgment
that
your
clients
had
obtained
in
the
united
states,
and
that
in
effect
they,
therefore,
if
they
were
going
to
make
a
claim
on
assets
in
the
philippines,
they
would
have
to
start
from
scratch
again.
is
that
correct?
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this:
did
the
philippine
government
formally
take
a
position
in
raising
these
obstructive
barriers,
the
$8
million
filing
fee,
for
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
that
was
sua
sponte
with
the
court?
