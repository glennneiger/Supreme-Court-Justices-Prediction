justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
see
what
you're
doing.
you're
constructing
your
argument
so
that
we
have
structural
protections.
i
can
understand
that
argument,
but
justice
souter's
question
points
out
just
as
a
practical
matter
this
is
not
nearly
as
important
as
a
failure
to
object
to
illegally
seized
evidence,
a
post...
a
post-arrest
delay,
open
courtroom,
all
of
which
are
subject
to
waiver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
was
interested
in
your
comment
on
trying
cases,
but
to
say
that
you
have
to
sit
down
and
explain
to
the...
to
the
defendant
the
difference
between
the
magistrate
and
an
article
iii
and
why
you
like
this
particular
magistrate...
it's
the
attorney
that
does
all
the
questioning,
after
all...
it
seems
to
me
is...
is
a
burden.
it's
not
justified
by
the
position
that
you're...
you're
submitting
to
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
gets
back
to
your
structural
argument,
which
makes
a
certain
amount
of
sense
just
insofar
as
knowing
where
the
line
is.
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
just
not
sure
of
the
practical
significance
of
the
client's
participation
when
it's
really
the
attorney
who
is
making
the
decision
whether
or
not
this
magistrate
will
allow
him
to
strut
his
stuff
in
front
of
the
jury
for
a
little
longer
than
the
district
judge
would.
i
just
don't
see
how
the
client
can
really
have
much
informed
input
into
that
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
i
know
you
don't
like
to
contemplate
this,
but
that
we
accept
the
petitioner's
position
that
there
has
to
be,
that
the
client
has
to
waive.
would
we
be
better
off
just
adopting
the
rule
that
there
has
to
be
express
waiver,
or
would
you
then
recommend
that
we
ask
the
further
question
whether
or
not
there
was
an
implied
consent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
was
there,
he
probably
knew
and
the
record
shows
that
he
knew
what
was
going
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i,
frankly,
don't
think
we
should
go
down
that
route.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
that
work?
you
have
some
jurors,
and
you
have
juror's
excused
for
cause,
and
there
is
an
argument
about
that,
then
that
juror
has
to
sit
down
and
wait
for
two
days
and
then
they
go
back
and
they
review
that
before
the
district
judge.
i
just
don't
know
mechanically
how
that
can
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me,
if
the
article
iii
judge
says,
oh,
this
should
not
have
been
excused
for
cause,
then
you
go
back
and
bump
the
juror
that
was
seated...
i
guess
that's
the
way
you'd
have
to
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
magistrate
judge
would
overstep...
assuming
you
win
and
that
is
that
rule
is
that
the
attorney
can
make
the
waiver,
would
the
magistrate
judge
overstep
by
saying
i
know
you've
consented
to
this,
but
i
want
you
to
talk
to
your
client
about
it;
i
want
you
to
explain
what
the
rules
are?
would
that
be
overstepping?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
federal
statutes
create
the
position
of
united
states
magistrate
judge
and
the
statutes
prescribe
their
duties.
magistrate
judges
are
not
appointed
pursuant
to
article
3
of
the
constitution.
and
in
earlier
cases,
we've
addressed
whether
they
can
perform
certain
duties.
the
statute
that's
involved
here
says
that
they
can
perform
"additional
duties
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws."
our
earlier
cases
established
that
magistrate
judges
can
preside
at
the
jury
selection
phase
and
conduct
voir
dire
in
a
felony
criminal
case,
provided
there
is
consent.
and
this
case
requires
us
to
decide
whose
consent.
can
counsel
alone
give
consent?
or
must
the
defendant
give
his
or
her
own
consent?
the
petitioner
was
charged
in
united
states
district
court
on
five
felony
drug
offense
counts.
now,
at
the
outset
of
the
jury
selection
phase,
the
parties
appeared
before
a
magistrate
judge.
the
magistrate
judge
asked
the
attorneys
to
approach
the
bench
and
after
they
complied,
the
magistrate
said,
"i
need
to
ask
the
parties
at
this
time
if
they
are
going
to
consent
to
having
united
states
magistrate
judge,
i.e.
me,
and
preside
in
assisting
the
jury
selection
of
this
case."
the
petitioner's
counsel
responded,
"yes,
your
honor,
we
are."
petitioner
himself
was
not
asked
if
he
consented
to
the
magistrate
judge's
presiding,
the
petitioner
was
in
the
courtroom.
the
record
does
not
permit
us
to
infer
this
or
even
to
infer
that
the
petitioner
knew
there
was
a
right
to
be
waived.
the
petitioner
made
no
objections
to
the
magistrate
judges
ruling
on
the
voir
dires
and
selection
phase.
the
district
judge
then
presided
at
the
jury
trial
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty
on
all
counts.
petitioner
appealed
and
he
contended
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
error
not
to
obtain
his
own
consent
to
the
magistrate
judges
presiding
at
voir
dire.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
disagreed
and
affirmed
the
convictions.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
find
no
error
here.
we
hold
the
petitioner's
counsel
had
full
authority
to
consent
to
the
magistrate
judge's
role.
as
a
general
matter,
when
there
is
a
full
trial,
there
are
various
points
in
the
pretrial
and
trial
process
when
rights
either
can
be
asserted
or
waived,
and
there
is
support
in
our
cases
for
concluding
that
some
of
these
rights
cannot
be
waived
absent
the
defendant's
own
consent.
although
there
are
basic
rights
that
the
attorney
cannot
waive
without
the
fully
inform
and
publicly
acknowledged
consent
of
the
client.
the
lawyer
has
and
must
have
full
authority
to
manage
the
conduct
of
the
trial.
acceptance
of
the
magistrate
judge
at
the
jury
selection
phase
is
a
tactical
decision,
that
is
well-suited
for
the
attorney's
own
decision.
the
judges'
particular
approach
to
voir
dire
both
in
substance,
that
is
to
say
that
the
questions
asked
and
in
tone,
formal
or
informal,
maybe
relevant
in
light
of
the
attorney's
own
approach,
requiring
personal
on
the
record
approval
from
the
client
could
necessitate
a
lengthy
explanation.
the
client
might
not
understand
at
the
moment
and
that
might
distract
for
more
pressing
matters
as
the
attorney
seeks
to
prepare
the
best
defense.
consent
from
an
attorney
will
therefore
suffice.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
