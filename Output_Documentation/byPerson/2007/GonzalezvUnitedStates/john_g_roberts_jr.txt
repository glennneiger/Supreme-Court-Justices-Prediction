chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-11612,
gonzalez
v.
united
states.
mr.
newton.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
may
not
be
a
pertinent
question,
but
where
does
the
right
to
voir
dire
come
from
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
derivative
from
other
rights?
in
other
words,
it
helps
implement
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
in
the
batson
context
helps
guard
against
an
equal
protection
violation,
but
it's
not
on
its
own
a
free-standing
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
practice,
it's
more
a
tactical
decision
than
a
theoretical
one.
i
mean
you
can
explain
to
your
client
the
difference
between
article
iii
and
a
magistrate,
but
he's
going
to
be
more
interested
in
your
judgment
about,
oh,
judge
so
and
so
doesn't
let
you
get
away
with
anything
on
voir
dire,
you
know,
he
runs
a
tight
ship.
this
magistrate
will
let
me
raise
all
sorts
of
other
things.
i
mean,
it's
like
an
objection
at
trial,
in
other
words.
it's
going
to
be
a
tactical
decision
rather
than
a
theoretical
constitutional
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you
get
to
that
point,
which
case
of
ours
holds
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
a
personal
right
that
the
defendant
must
waive
rather
than
waive
through
counsel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
can
be
expressed
through
counsel.
i
mean,
does...
you
know,
does
your
client
consent
to
this?
yes.
i
mean
it's
quite
a
different
question
to
say
that
he
has
to
be
the
one
who
stands
up
in
court
and
says
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but,
of
course,
that
was
for
the
whole
trial.
this
is
for
a
very
discrete
aspect
prior
to
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
there
a
right
to
voir
dire
at
common
law?
i
have
the
impression
the
judge
would
send
somebody
out
and,
you
know,
grab
the
first
12
people
they
could
find.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
newton.
ms.
blatt?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
it
might
be
said
of
the
right
to
plead
guilty
as
well.
the
lawyer
has
a
lot
more
experience
with
what
kind
of
sentence
the
judge
is
going
to
impose,
what
the
odds
are
of
the
jury
returning
a
verdict
of
innocence.
i
mean,
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
is
better
situated
to
make
the
judgment
doesn't
mean
it's
not
a
fundamental
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you...
do
you
think
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
something
that
has
to
be
personally
waived
by
the
defendant
or
can
that
be
waived
through
counsel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
were
those...
was
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
at
issue
in
those
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
i
was
researching
it,
i
saw
that
it
was
usually
included
in
the
list,
but
i
thought
it
would
track
back
to
some
case
that
held
that
it
was,
but
it
never...
never
does.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
suppose
the
question
would
come
up.
i
mean,
if
the
circuit
does
that
the
question
would
come
up,
if
the
magistrate
doesn't
do
it
and
it's
not
objected
to,
because
of
course
if
it's
objected
to
you
deal
with
it
then.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then
we'd
have
to
decide,
or
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
that's
a
basis
for
reversal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
newton,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
