justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
go
back
to
i
think
it
was
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
the
comparative
significance
of
the
waiver
here.
the
paradigm
examples
of
waivers
that
have
to
be
personal
are,
you
know,
waivers
of
counsel,
waivers
of
the
right
to
put
the
state
to
trial.
this
question
of
waiving
an
article
iii
judge
as
opposed
to
an
article
iii
appointed
magistrate
just
does
not
seem
to
rise
to
the
significance
of...
of
the...
of
the...
of
those
other
paradigm
waivers
and
what
is...
what
is
your
response
to
that?
you
started
to
say
that,
you
know,
that
the
framers
said
article
iii
judges
are
important
because
they...
they
have
independence
and
so
on.
but
beyond
that
kind
of
high
theoretical
level,
is
there
anything
in
practical
terms
that
you
think
brings
this
kind
of
a
waiver
to
the
point
of
significance
of,
say,
waiving
counsel?
justice
david
h.
souter
peretz,
also,
if
i
understand
the
case
correctly,
equated
the
waiver
with
a
failure
to
object.
it
seems
to
me
that
peretz
undercuts
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
they
are
ambiguous,
but
isn't
it...
i've
reread
peretz
after
many
years
getting
ready
for
this
argument,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
difficult
to
read
peretz
without
reading
the
"waiver
failure
to
object"
phraseology
as
being
equivalent.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
for
one
thing,
and
that
is,
if...
if
it
is
sound
to
say
that
peretz
equated
"waiver"
with
"failure
to
object",
"failure
to
object"
is
a...
is
a
failure,
if
you
will,
of
counsel,
not
of
the
defendant.
defendants
don't
get
up
and
make
objections;
counsel
do.
and,
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
the
implication
of
peretz
is
that
it
would
be
a...
a
decision
of
the
lawyer
that
would
count
for
constitutional
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
point
was
you
were
saying
that
in
fact
peretz
cannot
be
read
as
authority
for
the
government's
position
because
the
facts
in
peretz,
quite
as
you
correctly
note,
were
that
the...
the
client
had
in
fact
consented,
or
that
was
the
representation
to
the
court.
and
my
point
simply
was
that
does
not
seem
to
have
been
the
reasoning
of
the
court,
because
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
equating
"waiver"
with
"failure
to
object"
was
a
reasoning
that
in
its
reference
to
"failure
to
object"
seemed
to
pinpoint
the
actions
of
the
lawyer
alone.
clients
don't
object;
lawyers
do.
a
failure
to
object,
therefore,
refers
to,
in
effect,
a
failure
by
the
lawyer,
alone;
and
that
would
be
the
only
significant
datum
for
constitutional
purposes.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
