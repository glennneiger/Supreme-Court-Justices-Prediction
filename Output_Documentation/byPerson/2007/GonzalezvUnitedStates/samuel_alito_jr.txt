well,
where
a
defendant
is
waiving
a
jury
trial
or
pleading
guilty,
that's
something
that
an
ordinary
person
can
probably
readily
understand.
but
how
likely
is
it
that
an
ordinary
defendant
is
going
to
have
any
kind
of
independent
opinion
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
better
for
the
voir
dire
to
be
presided
over
by
a
district
judge
as
opposed
to
a
magistrate
judge?
isn't
the
situation
going
to
be
in
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
cases
that
your
client
will
simply
turn
to
you
and
say,
which
do
you
think
is
better,
and
whatever
the
lawyer
recommends,
that's
what
the
client
is
going
to
do?
isn't
that
the
realistic
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
there
has
to
be
a
showing
on
the
record
that
the
waiver
is
knowing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
think
there
has
to
be
a
colloquy
like
a
rule
11
colloquy
or
a
waiver
of
counsel's,
this
is
the
different,
this
is
what
a
district
judge
is,
this
is
what
a
magistrate
judge
is,
do
you
understand
the
difference
between
the
two?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
mr.
gonzalez
had
stood
up
at
some
point
during
the
voir
dire
and
said,
your
honor,
i've
just
learned
you're
not
an
article
iii
judge,
and
i
want
an
article
iii
judge
to
preside
over
the
voir
dire,
what
would
happen?
