mr.
newton,
you're
not
claiming
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
was
any
way
disadvantaged
by
the
magistrate
judge
conducting
the
voir
dire,
are
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
objection
to
any
of
the
proceedings
by
the
magistrate
judge.
there
were
no
objections
to
any...
well,
she
didn't
do
the
questioning.
she
allowed
the
lawyer
to
do
the
questioning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
a
big
difference
between
having
a
judge
trial
and
a
jury
of
one's
peers.
the
difference
between
having
a
magistrate
judge
and
an
article
iii
judge
to
do
the
voir
dire
doesn't
have...
is
not
a
question
of
the
same
dimension.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we're
not
talking
about
a
trial.
we're
talking
about
the
voir
dire.
and
perhaps
you
could
tell
me
one
piece
of
information.
in
the
federal
proceedings
that
i've
observed,
it's
always
the
judge
who
does
the
questioning,
and
this
one
seemed
to
me
extraordinary.
the
magistrate
said
it
was
her
practice
to
let
the
lawyers
do
it,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
were
referring
a
while
back
to
the
gomez
case.
and
if
i
remember
that
case
correctly,
it
was
the
defense
counsel
who
made
the
objection
to
the
magistrate;
and
there's
nothing
to
indicate
whether
the
defense
counsel
had
done
that
in
consultation
with
the
defendant.
we
don't
have
any
idea
what
the
defendant's
wishes
were,
but
it
was
the
defendant...
it
was
the
lawyer
who
raised
the
objection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
the
lawyer's
choice,
and
we
have
no
indication
that
it
wasn't...
it
was
anything
other
than
the
strategic
choice
of
the
lawyer.
and
your
position
is
that
it
must
come
from
the
client,
and
there's
no
indication
that
it
did
in
the
gomez
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
if
you,
if
the
government
prevails,
what
happens
to
the
11th
circuit's
ruling
in
the...
what
was
it,
the
maragh--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--case
where
the
11th
circuit
said,
we're
not
going
to
mess
with
any
constitutional
question,
but
under
our
supervisory
power,
we're
going
to
tell
the
district...
the
magistrate
judges,
district
judges
in
this
circuit;
it's
a
simple
thing
to
do,
put
on
the
record
that
the
defendant
himself
consented.
that
would
be...
that
would
no
longer
be
valid,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
specifically
said,
we're
doing
this
under
our
supervisory
powers,
not
under
the
constitution.
so
my
question
was
could
a
circuit
still
say,
we
think
it's
better
for
the
defendant
himself
to
be
told,
so
in
our
circuit
that's
going
to
be
the
rule?
