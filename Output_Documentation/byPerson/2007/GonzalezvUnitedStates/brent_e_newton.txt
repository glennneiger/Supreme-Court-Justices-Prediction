mr.
brent
e.
newton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
was
not
present
at
the
bench
conference
and
did
not
have
the
assistance
of
an
interpreter
when
the
magistrate
judge
solicited
his
attorney's
consent
to
conduct
jury
selection.
the
record
does
not
reflect
the
petitioner
personally
consented
or
ever
learned
of
his
attorney's
consent.
whether
defense
counsel
can
unilaterally
waive
a
criminal
defendant's
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
at
jury
selection,
as
occurred
in
this
case,
is
a
serious
constitutional
question.
applying
the
constitutional
avoidance
doctrine,
this
court
should
avoid
answering
this
question
by
interpreting
the
iii
judge
at
felony
jury
selection.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
i'm
contending
that
the
denial
of
his
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
at
felony
jury
selection
violated
his
rights.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
well,
i
think
it
was
a
combination,
your
honor.
no,
we're
not
making
any
allegation
of
discrete
error
during
the
jury
selection
process.
we're
contending
that
there
should
have
been
a
personal
waiver
of
the
right
to
an
article
iii
judge.
the
"additional
duties"
clause--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--the
court
has
discussed
the
right
to
voir
dire
in
capital
cases
and
in
non-capital
cases
as
it
relates
to
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
court
has
said
that,
in
a
federal
case
particularly,
you
have
a
right
to
an
article
iii,
section
2
right
to
a
jury,
as
well
as
a
sixth
amendment
right,
and
the
court
has
referred
to
this
as
an
allocation
of
federal
judicial
power
in
the
people
as
well
as
in
judges.
so
selecting
the
jury
obviously
is
a...
has
constitutional
implications
with
respect
to
the
structure
of
article
iii
as
well
as
any
personal
right
a
defendant
may
have
to...
to
an
impartial
duty.
the
"additional
duties"
clause
is
silent
about
the
type
of
waiver
or
consent
required
and
the
silence
is
understandable.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
i've
had...
i
represent
people
in
trial
court
as
well
as
on
appeal,
and
i've
had
many
clients
who
like
district
judges
better
than
magistrates
or
magistrates
better
than
district
judges,
depending
on
how
they've
encountered
them
in
prior
proceedings.
so
i
don't
think
that's
an
assumption
i
would
make.
and,
more
importantly,
other
personal
rights...
the
right
to
a
grand
jury,
a
petty
jury...
those
are
rights
that
a
lot
of
defendants
don't
understand.
i've
had
to
explain
to
foreign
clients
what
a
jury
is
because
they
don't
have
juries
in
foreign
countries.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
well,
your
honor,
it's
hard
to
put
these
rights
in
terms
of
relative
importance.
the
framers
clearly
believed
article
iii
independence
was
essential
to
our
separation
of
powers
and
to
the
rights
of
defendants.
john
marshall...
the
court
in
hatter
quoted
from
former
chief
justice
john
marshall
saying
that
the
rights...
the
right
to
an
independent
judge
is
perhaps
most
important
in
a...
in
a
criminal
case
because
the
rights
of
the
most
powerful
person,
the
prosecutor,
versus--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
certain
judges
in
federal
court
tend
to
give
the
lawyers
a
lot
of
leeway.
other
ones...
other
judges
i've
appeared
before
do
it
themselves.
i
think
it
depends.
but
ultimately
it's
the
magistrate
who
is
ruling
on
challenges
for
cause
or
ruling
on
what
questions
are
appropriate.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
well--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--article
iii
judges
are
the
ones
who
select
magistrate
judges--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
your
honor,
the
magistrate
judges
have
been
permitted
to
exercise
the
attributes
of
article
iii
power
when
they
are
adjuncts.
the
court
in
gomez
unanimously
thought
that
the
magistrate's
role
at
felony
jury
selection
was
not
really
that
of
an
adjunct
because
there
was
no
meaningful
article
iii
review
of
the--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
i
think
it's
a
twofold
argument.
it's
one
that
we
presume
that
article
iii
judges
who
have
gone
through
the
senate
confirmation
and
presidential
appointment
process,
that
they
are
more
qualified
as
a
general
rule.
but
it
is
also
an
article
iii
exercise
of
power
because
magistrate
judges
do
not
have
those
protections
that
article
iii
provides
to
life-tenured
district
judges.
so
it
is...
it's
both
of
those
things.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
basically
three
characteristics
that
i
can
discern
in
the
court's
jurisprudence
about
other
personal
rights
that
must
be
personally
waived
by
a
defendant
on
the
record.
first
of
all,
it
obviously
must
be
a
fundamental
right,
and
i
think
that
the
court's
decisions
in
hatter
and
gomez
and
the
plurality
opinion
in
northern
pipeline,...
all
those
decisions
i
think
establish
that
the
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
at
a
critical
stage
of
a
criminal
case
is
a
fundamental
right.
but
there's
more
than
just
that.
that's
necessary
but
not
sufficient,
because
we
have
lots
of
fundamental
rights
that
can
be
waived
during
the
trial
by
the
attorney.
the
other
two
characteristics
are
i
think
what
distinguish
this
right
and
make
it
more
like
waiving
counsel
and
waiving
a
petit
jury
and
a
grand
jury
and
the
right
to
go
to
trial
at
all.
and
besides
being
fundamental,
the
second
characteristic
is
that
this
right
concerns
the
players
in
the
game
as
opposed
to
the
rules
of
the
game,
the
framework
of
the
proceedings
in
the
sense
of
the
players.
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
the
right
to
a
grand
jury,
the
right
to
counsel,
those
are
rights
that
concern
the
players
in
the
game,
as
opposed
to,
say,
the
confrontational--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
can
answer
your
question,
but
also
the
third
characteristic.
the
third
characteristic
of
this
kind
of
right
is
timing,
how
it's
waived.
the
court
in
barker
v.
wingo
said
these
personal
rights
are
to
be
waived
at
a
discrete
point
in
time,
as
opposed
to
something
during
the
heat
of
battle
of
the
adversarial
process.
so...
and
i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
the
right
to
an
article
iii
judge,
at
least
the
right
to
have
it
without
a
personal
waiver,
is
a
fundamental
right.
this
is
something
the
framers
considered
to
be
of
utmost
importance,
and
in
hatter
the
court
said
the
considerations
that
led
the
framers
to
believe
this
was
an
extremely
important
right--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
your
honor,
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
this
is
such
a
fundamental
right
that
it
must
be
personally
waived
by
a
defendant.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
your
honor,
the
very
same
thing
could
be
said
of
waiving
a
jury
or
a
grand
jury.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
two
cases
your
honor:
patton
v.
united
states,
1932,
and
adams
ex
rel.
u.s.
v.
mccann,
which
reaffirmed,
and
the
court
has
cited
those
two
cases
repeatedly
for
the
proposition
that
this
is
a
right
that
must
be
personally
waived.
the
fact
that
there
is
a--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--patton
i
suppose
would
have
been--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--but
it
became
enshrined
in
adams,
and
it
has
been
cited
repeatedly
for
that
proposition.
the
rule
reflects
it.
the
rule
of
criminal
procedure
reflects
it.
the
fact
that
there
is
a
strategic
or
a
tactical
aspect--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
your
honor,
it's...
the
language
in
adams
which
quotes
from
patton
says
it
must
be
the
express,
intelligent
consent
of
the
defendant,
which
has
been
widely
interpreted
as
personal--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
my
alternative
position
is,
at
the
very
least,
the
record
needs
to
reflect
that
when
counsel
speaks,
counsel
is
directly
speaking
with
the
approval
of
the
client.
in
peretz
that
was
the
situation.
in
peretz
the
pretrial
conference
involved
a
waiver
by
the
defense
attorney
in
the
presence
of
his
client
and
then
followed
up
by...
at
the
jury
selection
process
the
magistrate
said:
mr.
attorney,
do
i
have
the
consent
of
"your
client"?
and
this
was,
again,
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
that's
in
marked
contrast
to
what
we
have
in
this
case,
which
is
all
indications
were
going
to
be
it
was
going
to
be
judge
kazen
picking
the
jury,
the
article
iii
judge.
and,
then,
all
of
a
sudden,
the
magistrate
judge
appears
and
directs
only
the
attorneys
to
come
to
the
bench.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
distinguishable
because
when
one
is
objecting
to
the
violation
of
a
right,
that's
different
from
acquiescing
in
a
knowing
and
voluntary
and
intelligent
waiver
of
the
right.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
well,
your
honor,
in
gomez
it
was
an
objection
to
a
alleged
violation
of
article
iii,
as
opposed
to
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
an
article
iii
judge.
so
it's...
it's
the
converse
of
what
we
have
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
showing
on
the
record
implicitly
or
explicitly
that
mr.
gonzalez,
petitioner
in
this
case,
waived
or
knowingly
acquiesced
in
his
attorney's
waiver.
i
want
to
return,
if
i
could,
to...
to
congress's
intent.
in
18
u.s.c.
section
3401(b),
congress
was
crystal
clear
they
believed
in
a
misdemeanor
case
the
waiver
of
a
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
had
to
be
personal
and
expressed
by
the
defendant.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
in
peretz
the
court
equated
an
entire
delegation
of
a
misdemeanor
trial
to
delegation
of
felony
jury
selection.
they
were
comparable,
the
court
said.
the
dissent
in
that
case,
at
least
justice
marshall's
dissent,
said
it's
more
important.
so
we
have
at
least
eight
members--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
your
honor,
as
i...
as
i
think
i've
explained
in
the
brief,
peretz
is
full
of
many
statements
that
are
ambiguous.
but
everything
in
peretz
has--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--well,
your
honor,
peretz
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
two
things:
one,
it
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
facts
of
that
case
where
there
was
a
failure
to
object
after
the
attorney
had
personally...
or
had
stated
his
client
personally
considered
it.
secondly,
peretz
was
decided
before
the
court
in
olano
distinguished
between
waivers
and
forfeitures.
"consent",
even
in
the
fourth
amendment
context,
means
at
least
knowing
acquiescence.
"waiver"
clearly
means
an
intentional
and
knowing
relinquishment
of
a
right,
and
mere
silence
cannot
be
interpreted
as...
a
mere
failure
to
object
cannot
be--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
responding
to...
there
is
really...
the
government
makes
two
arguments
based
on
peretz:
one,
that
mere
silence
equals
to
a
waiver
or
consent,
and
that's
what
i
was
responding
to.
the
second
argument...
peretz
did
not
deal
with
the
issue
of
who
is
the
one
to
consent,
because
in
peretz
there
was,
practically
speaking,
personal
consent.
the
court
reframed
the
questions
presented
in
peretz
to
assume
consent.
there
is--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--your
honor,
i
would
think
in
certain
cases,
if
it's
a
personal
right
and
a
defense
lawyer
stands
up
and
says
in
the
presence
of
his
client,
my
client
consents,
and
the
client
doesn't
object
or
respond
that,
i
disagree,
then
it's
fair
perhaps
to
assume
there's
a
sufficient
showing
of...
of
personal
waiver
by
the
defendant.
but,
again,
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
just
vastly
different.
we
have
nothing
in
the
record--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--i
disagree.
i
think
that
you
have
to
read
peretz
in
light
of
the
very
special
facts
in
that
case,
which
involve
two
statements
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant:
that
the
defense
was
not
objecting
or
was
consenting;
and,
then,
in
particular,
the
defendant,
himself,
was
giving
consent.
and
i
think
you
have
to
also
look
at
the
court's
repeated
focus
on
the
fact
that
peretz
himself
gave
consent
in
that
case.
there
was
no
occasion
to
decide
which...
which
party,
the
lawyer
or
the
defendant,
was
the
one
to
properly
waive
in
the
peretz
case.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
under
18
u.s.c.
section
3401(b),
which
i
contend
is
the
obvious
analog
for
waiving
in
the
felony
context,
yes,
absolutely.
i
think,
at
the
very
least,
to
avoid
a
constitutional
doubt,
and
that's...
also,
i
should
say
up
front,
all
of
these
arguments
that
we
are...
or
points
we're
engaging
in
here
simply
show
this
is
a
serious
constitutional
question.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
it's
going
to
obviously
depend
on
the
defendant
because
every
case
involving
waiver
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances.
but,
at
the
very
least,
there
needs
to
be
a
showing
of
a
knowing,
voluntary
waiver
of
a
right
to
an
article
iii
judge.
this
is
done
every
day
in
america.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
in
terms
of
the
jury
selection
process?
mr.
brent
e.
newton
well,
i
would
think
the
lawyer
could
in
that
situation
for
the
simple
reason
that
you
have
already
at
that
point
established,
presumably,
an
article
iii
judge
is
presiding
or
it
has
been
validly
waived.
but
picking
the
jury,
the
jury
selection
or,
more
properly,
the
jury
exclusion,
because
it's
really
excluding
jurors
rather
than
picking
them,
that
is
a
qualitatively
different
thing
than
deciding
whether
there
is
a
jury
in
the
first
place
or
whether
an
article
iii
judge
should
preside
over
the
jury
selection.
so
i
would
say
the
lawyer
could
do
that,
because
that's
more
the
heat
of
the
battle,
the
adversarial
process
working,
as
opposed
to
a
discrete
point
in
time
before
it.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
i
think
certain
jurisdictions
have
done
that
before.
i
think
there's
been
bargaining
by
prosecutors
and
defense
counsel.
that
again
occurs
during
the
adversarial
workings
of
the
proceedings
as
opposed
to
the
discrete
point
in
time
before.
the...
justice
alito
asked
about
how
this
procedure
would
work.
this
has
gone
on
every
day
in
american
courtrooms
since
1979.
every
day
around
america
in
courtrooms,
federal
courtrooms,
in
magistrate
judge
cases
over
misdemeanors
this
kind
of
colloquy
goes
on.
this
is
done
every
day.
it's
done
in
the
very
same
courthouse
that
mr.
gonzalez
was
tried
in
because
they
regularly
refer
felony
guilty
pleas
to
magistrate
judges.
and
in
the
brief
i've
cited
a
couple
of
cases
reported
in
westlaw
where
district
judge
kazen
has
accepted
reports
and
recommendations
where
the
magistrate
judge
said,
i
went
over
the
right
to
article
iii
judge
with
the
defendant
personally,
he
executed
a
waiver,
and
this
was
done
on
the
record.
so,
this
is
not
some
innovative
proceeding.
this
has
been
done
since
1979
when
they
amended
section
3401(b).
the
legislative
history
to
section
3401(b)
clearly
shows
that
congress
believed
the
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
was
a
constitutional
right
that
had
to
be
personally
waived
by
the
defendant.
that
is
further
evidence
this
is
a
serious
constitutional
question.
the
court
should
avoid
answering
that
serious
constitutional
question
because
you
can
easily
interpret
the
federal
magistrate's
act,
in
particular
the
"additional
duties"
clause,
to
allow
for
consensual
delegation,
which
gomez
talked
about
and
peretz
talked
about,
only
if
it's
personal
consent.
so,
this
is
not
a
leap
of
logic
to
think
that
congress
would
have
intended
this
in
a
felony
case.
gomez
held
congress
never
intended
this,
this
was
not
something
congress
intended,
so
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
fill
in
a
gap
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
consent
is
appropriate.
and
congress
has
clearly
signaled
they
believe
a
defendant's
personal
express
consent
is
the
type
that
is
required.
at
the
very
least
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
question.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
if
i
could--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--sure.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
no,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--i
think
the
court
has
already
decided
the
vast
majority
of
these.
taylor
clearly
referred
to
the
confrontation
or
the
compulsory
process
clause.
there
are
numerous
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
said,
at
least
implicitly,
that
it's
waived
by
the
lawyer's
failure
to
object.
but
there
are
a
special
class
of
rights:
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
the
right
to
a
grand
jury,
the
right
to
counsel,
the
right
to
plead
not
guilty.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
well,
your
honor,
the
framers
clearly
believed
it
was
an
extremely
important
right
for
defendants.
congress
clearly
believed
this
was
a
constitutional
right
defendants
had
to
personally
waive.
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
may
be
in
a
better
position
to
make
the
judgment
would
be
equally
true
in
waiving
a
jury
or
a
grand
jury.
and
if
i
could
reserve
my
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
return
to
section
3401(b),
which
the
plain
language
of,
and
the
legislative
history
behind,
clearly
show
a
congressional
intent
in
the
misdemeanor
context
for
personal
waivers
on
the
record
by
defendants.
it
would
be
anomalous
not
to
require
the
same
thing,
at
least
in
some
similar
form,
in
the
felony
context.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
it
would
be
enough
if
the
lawyer
made
no
objection,
your
honor,
because
that
is
the
kind
of
rule
that
i
described
earlier
that
concerns
the
heat
of
the
battle
of
the
adversary
process,
unlike
a
discreet
point
in
time
before.
mr.
brent
e.
newton
the
other
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the...
it's
not
just
the
fact
that
it's
a
critical
stage;
it's
a
critical
stage
where
there
is
a
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
over
the
critical
stage.
the
court
in
gomez
clearly
recognized
that
jury
selection
is
a
critical
stage.
so
it
is
the
article
iii
right
that
implicates
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
but
it
is
fundamentally
the
right
to
an
article
iii
judge
that
is
at
issue.
the
government
makes
much
of
its
claim
that
there
could
be
meaningful
article
iii
de
novo
review
of
magistrate
judge
rulings.
the
court
unanimously
in
gomez
stated
that
the
court
highly
doubted
it
would
be
possible
to
have
such
review,
and
it
realistically
speaking
is
not
possible
because
delays
between
the
time
that
the
district
judge
can
get
back
to
conduct
a
review,
and
in
gomez
the
court
found...
pointed
out
that
if
you
bring
jurors
back
and
question
them
again,
you
run
the
risk
of
making
them
hostile...
they
think
they
did
something
wrong...
where
you
don't
have
that
in
an
erratic
situation
where
you're
delegating
an
evidentiary
hearing.
witnesses
get
recalled
all
the
time.
they
know
that's
part
of
the
process.
so,
realistically
speaking,
there
is
no
de
novo
review,
which
is
why
it's
not
an
adjunct
situation
here.
it's
not
the
magistrate
judge
acting
as
an
adjunct;
it's
the
magistrate
judge
acting
as
an
article
iii
judge.
the
government
argues
plain
error
doctrine
should
apply,
rule
52(b).
justice
scalia's
concurring
opinion
in
freytag
noted
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
rights
that
can
be
waived
or
forfeited,
and
most
rights
can
be
forfeited
short
of
a
waiver,
but
there
are
certain
kinds
of
rights...
and
we
contend
this
is
one
of
them...
that
cannot
be
forfeited
short
of
a
valid
waiver.
the
court
in
barker
and
in
boykin
v.
alabama
stated
that
there
are
certain
personal
rights
where
the
prosecution
has
the
entire
responsibility
to
spread
on
the
record
the
valid
waiver.
and
if
the
prosecution
doesn't
meet
that
burden
in
the
trial
court,
it's
illogical
to
apply
the
burden
on
the
defendant
on
appeal
when
it's
the
prosecution
that
would
need
to
assure
it
was
the
defendant's
personal
waiver
that
happened
in
the
trial
court.
the
court
in
wynn
and
glitton
and
other
cases
moreover
has
said,
if
it's
a
fundamental
question
of
judicial
administration,
then
it
can
be
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
i
think
the
court
also
should
consider
the
facts
of
this
case
in
deciding
whether
there
was
gamesmanship.
there
wasn't.
clearly
there
wasn't.
mr.
gonzalez
was
cut
out
of
the
equation
entirely.
the
magistrate
judge
only
invited
the
attorneys
to
the
bench,
left
him
sitting
there
without
the
assistance
of
an
interpreter.
you
have
to
consider
his
personal
characteristics.
he
had
no
experience
in
the
federal
criminal
justice
system.
he
did
not
speak
english
fluently.
he
was
in
no
position
to
object.
he
didn't
have
the
meaningful
opportunity
to
object.
and
under
rule
51(b),
there
should
be
de
novo
for
that
reason
as
well.
i
finally
i
just...
i
want
to
return
to
my
main
point,
which
is...
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
whether
a
personal
waiver
is
required.
i
think
there's
a
very
strong
argument
based
on
the
court's
precedent
that
should
happen
and--
mr.
brent
e.
newton
--i'm
asking
the
court
to
avoid
that
question
by
interpreting
the
3401(b).
thank
you.
