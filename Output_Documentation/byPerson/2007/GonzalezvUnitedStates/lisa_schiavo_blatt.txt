ms.
lisa

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
whether
to
have
a
magistrate
judge
conduct
voir
dire
is
a
strategic
call
that
counsel
is
uniquely
qualified
to
make.
counsel
is
best
equipped
to
determine
whether
the
magistrate
judge's
particular
style,
reputation
or
practice
in
addressing
prospective
jurors
or
resolving
objections
outweigh
the
independence
conferred
by
article
iii.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
and
for
the
few
fundamental
decisions
where
the
defendant
must
personally
explicitly
make,
they
have
a
monumental
impact
on
the
defendant,
and
they
protect
values
that
extend
beyond
mere...
mere
trial
strategy.
if
a
defendant
is
indicted
for
a
criminal
offense,
he
readily
understands
he's
going
to
have
to
decide,
do
i
want
to
plead
guilty,
do
i
want
to
stand
trial,
do
i
want
counsel,
do
i
want
a
jury.
he
does
not
readily
appreciate
that
decisions
that
occurred
during
voir
dire,
such
as
whether
to
have
an
article
iii
judge
or
a
magistrate,
whether
to
exercise
peremptory
challenges,
whether
to
challenge
jurors
for
cause,
whether
to
object
to
the
prosecutor's
actions.
these
are
all
decisions
that
are
entrusted
to
counsel's
best
professional
judgment
and
his
fiduciary
obligation
to
represent
the
defendant.
the
defendant...
i
mean,
the
defense
lawyer
also
speaks
for
the
client
in
exercising
the
defendant's
confrontation
clause
rights,
introduce
or
object
to
evidence,
to
object
to
the
closing
of
the
courtroom.
there's
just
a
small
handful
of
fundamental
rights.
and
for
the
vast
majority
of
criminal
defendants,
they
don't
even
have
article
iii
rights,
mr.
chief
justice;
they're
in
state
court.
so
it's
an
important
right.
it
implicates
important
trial
issues.
but
nonetheless,
counsel
is
best
equipped
to
make
it.
and
i
do
think,
unlike
the
decision
whether
you're
going
to
be
convicted
or
stand
trial
or
even
testify,
this
is
a
decision
where
the
defendant
is
overwhelmingly
likely
to
defer
to
counsel's
tactical
and
strategic
judgment.
in
this
case,
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
one
other
thing
about
the
magistrate.
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
she
not
only
let
the
lawyers
pose
their
own
questions
to
the
jurors,
she
also
gave
the
lawyers
each
an
extra
peremptory
challenge.
and
that
just
shows
that
magistrate
judges
can
have
particular
styles
or
practice,
and
counsel
would
be
uniquely
situated
to
assess
the
value
of
that.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
they
were
all
by
consensus,
so
yes,
she
ruled
on
them
in
that
jurors
were
excused
for
various
reasons.
but
there
was...
it
was
pretty
much
by
consensus
by
defense
counsel
and
the
prosecutor.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right,
and
defense
counsel's
going
to
have
to
weigh
in
any
given
case
whether
the
magistrate
judge
is
going
to
rule
on
any
objections
and
de
novo
review
is
possible,
but
it's
difficult
as
a
practical
matter,
as
the
court
noted
in
peretz.
the
defense
counsel
is
best
situated
to
decide,
and
i
want
to
get
the
most
favorable
jury
i
can
for
my
client,
what's
the
best
way
to
do
that?
is
this
magistrate
judge
better
off...
am
i
better
off
with
which
one?
and
defense
counsel,
if
he
has
any
concerns,
can
object
to
the
magistrate's
role
and
then
would
be
entitled
under
the
federal
magistrate
act
to
have
an
article
iii
judge
conduct
voir
dire.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
an
implied
consent
in--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--if
an
explicit
personal--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--if
a
personal
explicit
waiver
is
required,
there
wasn't
one
here.
the
express
waiver
was
by
defense
counsel,
so
it
would
not
meet
that
test
of
having...
i
don't
know
what
the
implied
waiver
would
be.
there
is
an
expressed
waiver
by
defense
counsel.
if
counsel
just
said
nothing
and
there
was
no
objection,
which
is
not
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
then
there
would
be
a
question
on
how
do
you
read
this
court's
decision
in
peretz.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
under
this
court's
decision
in
peretz,
there
would
be
de
novo
review
at
the
end
of
the
process.
and
here
an
article
iii
judge
actually
swore
in
the
jury
but
there
was,
nothing
was
ever
objected
to
by
the
magistrate's
role.
there
was
no--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--he
can.
right.
yes.
and
if
the
court
said
in
peretz
that
the
constitution
would
require
that
the
review
be
de
novo
and
they
recognize
in
a
footnote
this
court
that
as
a
practical
matter
it
might
be
difficult
to
reweigh
credibility
determinations,
and
you
have
the
same
kind
of
issues
when
a
magistrate
judge
conducts
social
security
cases
or
suppression
hearings,
the
magistrate
rules
on
or
weighs
credibility
and
there
is
a
de
novo
review
by
the
article
iii
judge.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
don't
know
if
it
can
be
done
that
day.
i
mean,
in
this
case,
the
jury
selection
was
just
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
hours.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think
this
discussion
just
shows
why
a
defendant...
this
would
not
be
a
right
that
he
would
readily
appreciate
and
understand.
this
is
something
defense
counsel
would
just
decide.
and
is
it...
in
this
particular
trial,
and
this
was
a
short
drug
trial,
this
voir
dire
occurred
without
incident
and
it
was
pretty
routine.
is
this
something
that
if
it
were
different
type
of
case
defense
counsel
might
think,
no,
i
don't
want
whatever
disruption
it
might
be
and
we
want
an
article
iii
judge.
and
defense
counsel
is
of
course
able
to
object.
i
also
wanted
to
point
out--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--we
read
a
discussion
of
it
in
florida
v.
nixon
and
new
york
v.
hill
including
that
among
the
rights
that
required
a
personal
explicit
waiver.
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
it
was
just
a
descriptive:
there
are
decisions
of
such
moment
that
the
defendant
must
personally
make
and
this
is
usually
included
in
the
list.
but
whatever...
whatever--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
whatever
is
in
the
list,
it's
a
very
small
handful
and
it
is
something
that
the
defendant--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it's
a
very
short
list,
and
i
just
think
it's
something
that
a
defendant
can
readily
appreciate,
even
though
it
may
be
a
strategic
call,
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
plead
guilty
or
even
take
the
stand.
i
mean,
the
right
to
testify
is
a
decision
that
personally
belongs
to
the
defendant,
but
you
still
don't
need
an
on-the-record,
explicit
personal
consent
by
the
defendant
personally.
if
the
defense
lawyer
says,
we
have
no
witnesses,
the
client's
assent
is
assumed
and
that's
just
the
way
our
criminal
justice
system
works.
the
lawyer
does
speak
for
the
defendant
in
all
but
the
very
few
exceptional
cases.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
maragh--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
i
think
a...
there
is
nothing
to
stop
them--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
don't
think
so.
i
mean...
and
that's
why
the
court
took
the
case
to
resolve
that
circuit.
and
i
read
the
decision
as
reading
this
court's
decision
in
peretz
to
require
it.
or
at
least
there
was
some
constitutional
doubt
about
it
but
i
don't--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
mean,
i
don't
think
i
have
a
fully
developed
answer
on
that,
but
my
guess
would
be
our
position
is
no.
but
i
don't...
i
don't
think
there's
at
least
anything
to
stop
the
particular
magistrate
judge
in
any
given
case
from
saying...
from
addressing
the
defendant
or
requiring
it.
but--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
well,
i--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
and
on
that
issue
our
position
is
clear:
there
is
a
rule
that
would
dictate
how
it
would
be
resolved
and
rule
52(b)
of
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedures
has
no
exception,
and
plain
error
would
apply.
and
so
if
there
was
some
sort
of
error,
the
defendant
would
have
to
make
the
necessary
showings
for
plain
error
review,
and
on
that
i
would
like
to
address,
since
we
are
on
the
subject,
that
if
the
court
disagreed
with
us
on
the
merits,
rule
52(b)
would
apply
and
we
think
that
all
the
concerns
that
animate
a
contemporaneous
objection
rule
are
at
their
peak
when
the
defense
counsel
expressly
agrees
to
the
course
of
action
followed
by
the
court,
and
petitioner's
rule
of
automatic
reversal
would
open
the
door
to
gamesmanship
and
sandbagging
because
it
would
allow
defense
counsel
to
wait
and
see
if
the
defendant
is
convicted
before
objecting
to
the
magistrate's
role.
and
before
i
get
to...
i
wanted
to
turn
to,
if
you
apply
plain
error,
i
just
wanted
to
point
one
thing
out
about
the
court's
decision
in
peretz.
this
was
not
something
that
was
just
not
at
issue
in
the
case.
the
petitioner
extensively
argued
that
the
waiver
in
that
case
was
ineffective
because
it
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
section
3401(b);
there
was
no
personal
explicit
waiver;
the
defendant
did
not
understand
what
was
happening,
he
didn't
speak
english
well,
and
so
on;
and
the
dissenting
justices
picked
up
on
that
and
urged
the
court
and
dissented
because
there
had...
one
of
the
reasons
there
was
not
an
explicit
and
personal
waiver
by
the
defendant.
and
the
court
nonetheless
upheld
the
magistrate's
role
in
jury
selection
despite
the
absence
of
that
waiver.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
our
position
is
the
magistrate
judge
could
say
sit
down.
this
is
if
defendant
says
my
counsel
is
putting
in
some
evidence
i
don't
like
or
my
counsel
is
not
cross
examining
the
witness
or
my
counsel
just
asked
a
juror
a
question
that
i'm
really
uncomfortable
with.
i
mean,
this
show
belongs
to
the
lawyer,
and
the
magistrate
judge
could
tell
him
to...
to
be
quiet.
the
defendant
has
not
made
a...
and
his
time
is
not
up
yet...
in
effect
an
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
but
if
he
has
an
objection
and
he
think
his
right
rises
to
the
level
to
testify,
that
he
has
some
duty...
that
the
lawyer
had
some
duty
of
personal
consultation,
then
he
can
make
that
sixth
amendment
argument.
we
don't
think
it
would
have
any
merit
because
this
is
no
different
than
the
myriad
other
types
of
trial
rights
that
belong
to
counsel.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
i
think
there
is
some
room
for
that.
i
mean
i...
some
room
for
that
for
the
court,
but
it's...
it's
not
like
it's
the
right
to
testify.
it
would
be
hard
to,
you
know,
if
there
was
some
argument
over
objection
or
how
to
question
prospective
jurors.
there's
not
a
hybrid
defense
team
where
the...
the
judge
is
always
supposed
to
turn
to
the
defendant
and
say
are
you
sure
you're
comfortable
with
what
your
counsel
is
doing?
if
the
court
does
conclude
that
there
is
error,
the
petitioner,
we
don't
think
has
made
the
necessary
showing
for
plain
error
review.
the
first
problem
and
the
most
fundamental
is
the
error
is
not
plain,
because
this
court
has
already
upheld
the
role
of
the
magistrate
judge
in
jury
selection
in
peretz,
despite
the
absence
of
a
personal
waiver;
and
at
least
four
courts
have
read
that
decision
to
allow
a
magistrate
judge
to
conduct
voir
dire,
either
when
there
is
an
absence
of
an
objection
or
there
is
express
consent
by
defense
counsel.
and
even
assuming
this
court
doesn't
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
error
had
an
effect
on
substantial
rights,
the
error
did
not
seriously
affect
the
fairness,
integrity
or
public
confidence
of
criminal
proceedings.
the
error...
the
voir
dire
in
this
case
occurred
without
incident
or
objection,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
to
anything
that
the
magistrate
judge
did;
and
there
is
no
indication...
and
i
don't
think
we
have
heard
any...
there
is
no
indication
that
the
defendant
actually
disagreed
with
his
counsel's
professional
judgment
to
consent
to
have
the
magistrate
judge,
or
even
had
an
opinion
on
the
subject.
and
petitioner's
rule
would,
as
i
said,
open
the
door
to
gamesmanship
because
it
would
relieve
counsel
of
any
obligation
to
call
an
error
to
the
court's
attention
and
therefore
give
the
court
the
opportunity
to
correct
the
error.
if
there
are
no
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
be
affirmed.
