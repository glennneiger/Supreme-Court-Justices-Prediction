justice
antonin
scalia
whose
thumb
is
the
magistrate
under?
is
he
under
the
thumb
of
article
i
or
article
ii
or
article
iii?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
decides
whether
he
stays
on
or
she
stays
on
as
a
magistrate?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we're
really
not
talking
here
about
giving
away
any
article
iii
power.
i
mean,
the
magistrate
is
only
subject
to
article
iii.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
but
the
reason...
the
reason
presumably
is
that
an
article
iii
judge,
which
goes...
who
goes
through
a
much
more
substantial
process
of
selection
and
confirmation
is
much
more
qualified.
now,
if
you
want
to
make
that
argument,
that's
fine,
but
that's
a
quite
different
argument
from
saying
that
we're
giving
away
article
iii
powers
to
magistrates,
right?
magistrates
are
creatures
of
article
iii.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
was
the
holding
in
patton?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it
was
dicta.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
what
adams
stood
for
was
that
the
defendant
can
himself
waive
the
right
to
jury
without
advice
of
counsel,
that
if
he
wants
to
do
it
on
his
own
he
can
do
it
without
counsel.
it
doesn't
mean
that
if
counsel
does
it
without
his
objection
at
the
time
it's
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
yes,
but...
everybody
concedes
that,
but
the
question
is
by
whom?
certainly
very
many
rights,
you
will
acknowledge,
can
be
waived
by
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can't
simply
say
it
requires
an
express
and
knowing
waiver,
attributing
that
express
and
knowing
waiver
to
the
defendant.
sure,
it
does,
but
who
has
to
be
"express",
and
who
has
to
be
"knowing"?
that's
the
issue
before
us
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
we
supposed
to
go
through
every
one
of
the
rights
that
a
defendant
has
in
a
trial
one
by
one
and
decide,
you
know,
this
one
the
lawyer
can
make,
this
one
the
defendant
must
make
personally?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
by
one?
i
mean,
i
never
thought
that
that
was
the
approach
we
take.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
she
rule
on
strikes
for
cause?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
i
mean,
that
is,
i
suppose,
the
most
significant
power
that
the
judge
who
is
conducting
the
voir
dire
or
presiding
at
the
voir
dire
has,
to
allow
or
not
allow
a
strike--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
our
list,
after
all,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
would
be
valid
or
don't
think
it
wouldn't
be
valid?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
just...
a
question
that
has
troubled
me.
basically,
what
you
say
that
is
of
such
importance
here
is
the
composition
of
a
jury.
i
mean,
that's
what
it
all
boils
down
to,
who's
going
to
rule
on
the
composition
of
the
jury,
should
it
be
a
magistrate
or
should
it
be
an
article
iii
judge.
but
if...
you
know,
if
that
is...
is
so
fundamental
that
it
needs
a
special
rule
that
the
waiver
has
to
be
personal
by
the
defendant,
then
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about...
about
objections
to...
to
the
court's
failure
to
permit
a
strike
for
cause.
that
affects
the
composition
of
the
jury.
now
do
you
need...
do
you
need
the
defendant's
consent
to
the
judge's
ruling
on
that
point,
or
is
it
enough
if
the
lawyer
makes
no
objection?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
