justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it's
a
different
context,
but...
it
does
not
relate
to
the
magistrate
versus
article
iii
judge,
but
do
you
think
that
a
lawyer
could
stipulate
that
the
judge
or
a
magistrate
presiding
could
do
all
the
questioning
and
the
lawyers
would
do
none,
without
the...
without
the
express
consent
of
his
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
the
voir
dire
is
peculiarly
the...
an
area
in
which
the
lawyer
knows
what
he
is
up
to
and
what's
at
stake,
and
the
client
does
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
a
jurisdiction
could
adopt
a
rule
that
was
especially
careful
about
selecting
the
jury
panel
and
then
decided
they
would
take
the
first
12
jurors
off
an
arbitrary
list,
just
to
pick
them
at
random
and
have
no
voir
dire
during
the
trial,
just
to
have
a
preliminary
screening
of
qualifications
of
the...
of
the
entire
panel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
how
it
works
in
practice?
does
the
magistrate's
ruling
on
objections
to
jurors,
are
those
rulings
subject
to
review
by
the
district
judge
or
are
they
final?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
practice,
as
i
understand
it,
very
often
the
judge
will,
will
review
the
magistrate's
decisions
on
contested
objections.
