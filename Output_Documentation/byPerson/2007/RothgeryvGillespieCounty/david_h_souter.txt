justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
is
the...
so
the
point
of
the
magistration
is
that
is
the
point
at
which
a
reasonable
time
starts
running
within
which
texas
must
afford...
appoint
counsel,
isn't
that
your
basic
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's
no
claim
that
there
was
anything
invalid
about
the
magistration
proceeding--
justice
david
h.
souter
--itself
because
there
was
no
counsel
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
claim...
for
example,
had
there
been
a
probable
cause
hearing,
that
the
attorney
would
have
been
required
to
participate
in
the
probable
cause
hearing
under--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there
has
simply
got
to
be
one
appointed
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
magistration.
that's...
that's
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you're
saying,
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
an
individual
can
be
brought
into
court,
held
in
jail
for
three
weeks
without
charge,
and
no
right
to
counsel
applies?
i
think
that's
your
answer,
but
i
want
to
make
sure.
i'll
be
candid
to
say
i'm
surprised.
but
if
that's
your
position,
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
want
to
know
what
your
answer
is
here.
get
to
authority
later,
but
i
want
to
know
whether
your
position
is
that
an
individual
may
be
brought
by
a
police
officer
before
a
magistrate,
charged
with
no
crime,
required
to
post
bail,
and
if
he
doesn't
post
bail,
be
held
for
three
weeks
without
charge.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
asking
whether
it
could
happen;
i'm
asking
whether
it
would
be
constitutional
without
appointing
counsel.
justice
david
h.
souter
without
charges
filed?
in
other
words,
if
the
lawyer
comes
in
and
says,
you
know,
my
client
is
sitting
in
jail,
you've
had
him
there
for
three
days
now,
and
no
complaint
has
been
filed
against
him,
we
don't
know
why
he
is
being
held...
your
answer...
the...
it's
a
constitutional
answer
to
say,
well,
you
know,
that's
for
us
to
know
and
you
to
find
out?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
no
complaint
needs
to
be
filed
by
the
police?
if
the
magistrate
says,
what's
this
guy
doing
here,
don't
the
police
normally
have
a
complaint,
in
this
case
a...
what
was
it,
a
possession
of
a
gun
by
a
felon,
say,
you
know,
we're
filing
this
complaint
that
charges
him
with
possessing
a
gun
with
a
felony
record?
and
wasn't
there
such
a
complaint
displayed
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
they
have
been
obligated
to
get
somebody
to
come?
justice
david
h.
souter
under
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
would
be
subject,
wouldn't
it,
to
sort
of
a
condition
subsequent,
because
if
it
turned
out...
i
mean
we...
no
counsel
is
required
if
there's
no
incarceration.
so
that
even
if
the
right
had
attached,
if
it
turned
out
later
that
there
was
no
incarceration
or
even
attempt
to
incarcerate,
then
that
would
relate
back,
and
there
wouldn't
be
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
isn't
that
right?
wouldn't
that
be
the
answer
to
the...
a
partial
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
now...
no,
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
mr.
rothgery
had,
immediately
upon
being
admitted
to
bail,
said:
i
want
a...
i
was
going
to
say
a
probable-cause
hearing.
you
have
a
different
term
for
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
"examining
trial".
justice
david
h.
souter
at
that
point,
under
texas
law,
the
right
to
counsel
within
one
or
three
business
days
would
have
attached?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
at
the...
may
i?
at
the
examining
trial,
is
there
a
charge
filed?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
are
they
finding
probable
cause
for
if
they
don't
know
what
the
charge
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
realize
if
the...
if
somebody
is
going
to
demonstrate
probable
cause,
the
probable
cause
has
got
to
be
probable
cause
to
hold
someone
to
answer
for
a
particular
charge.
so
why
hasn't
there,
as
a
matter
of
definition,
got
to
be
a
charge,
even
on
your
reasoning,
by
the
time
the
examining
trial
is
held?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
right.
it
is
a
probable-cause
determination,
and
you've
got
to
have
an
answer:
probable
cause
for
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so,
in
other
words,
you
determine
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed
without
charging
the
individual
with
the
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
just
asking
what
you
do.
is
that
the
case?
is
no
charge
filed?
then,
at
the
end
of
the
probable
cause
hearing
you
say:
well,
we...
the
judge
says:
well,
you've
got
probable
cause
to
hold
this
person
for
possessing
a
gun
after
having
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
but
there
doesn't
happen
to
be
any
charge
to
that
effect
here.
is
that
the
state
of
the
law,
in
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
at
the
fifth
circuit.
based
on
an
erroneous
record,
texas
police
officers
arrested
the
petitioner,
walter
rothgery
as
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm
and
so,
promptly
brought
him
before
a
magistrate
judges
required
by
texas
law.
in
texas,
this
initial
appearance
combines
the
fourth
amendment's
required
probable
cause
determination
with
the
setting
of
bail.
it
is
the
point
at
which
the
arrestee
is
told
of
the
accusation
against
him.
rothgery
had
no
money
for
a
lawyer
and
made
several
requests
for
appointed
counsel,
but
the
county
did
not
appoint
a
lawyer
until
after
rothgery
had
been
indicted,
rearrested
and
jailed,
all
of
which
occurred
six
months
after
the
first
hearing.
when
a
lawyer
was
finally
assigned,
he
promptly
assembled
paperwork
confirming
that
rothgery
had
never
been
convicted
of
a
felony
and
the
indictment
was
dismissed.
rothgery
then
brought
this
section
1983
suit
against
the
county
arguing
that
it
should
have
appointed
him
a
lawyer
within
a
reasonable
time
following
the
first
hearing.
its
failure
to
do
so,
he
claims,
violated
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
the
fifth
circuit
disagreed
on
the
ground
that
the
right
to
counsel
does
not
apply
outside
of
criminal
prosecutions
and
rothgery's
right
had
not
attached
at
the
first
hearing
because
no
prosecutor
had
been
aware
of
or
involved
in
that
proceeding.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
threshold
attachment
question.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
vacate
and
remand
as
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
observed
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
does
not
attach
until
a
prosecution
has
begun.
we
have
pegged
commencement
of
a
prosecution
to
the
initiation
of
adversary
judicial
proceedings
and
the
issue
is
whether
texas'
first
hearing
marks
that
point
with
the
consequent
state
obligation
to
appoint
counsel
within
a
reasonable
time
once
a
request
for
assistance
is
made.
when
the
court
of
appeals
said
no,
because
no
prosecutor
was
aware
of
the
first
hearing
or
involved
in
it,
the
court
effectively
focused
not
on
the
start
of
adversarial
judicial
proceedings
but
on
the
activities
and
knowledge
of
a
particular
state
officer
who
was
presumably
otherwise
occupied
and
this
was
the
error.
in
michigan
v.
jackson
and
brewer
v.
williams,
we
held
that
adversary
judicial
proceedings
begin
and
the
right
to
counsel
thus
attaches
at
the
initial
appearance
before
a
judicial
officer
at
which
the
defendant
is
told
of
the
accusation
against
him
and
bail
is
set.
in
texas,
the
first
hearing
is
in
an
initial
appearance
in
jackson
and
brewer
control.
neither
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
nor
the
county
in
its
briefing
to
us
has
offered
an
acceptable
basis
for
distinguishing
those
decisions.
we
accordingly
vacate
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
joins
and
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
joined.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
