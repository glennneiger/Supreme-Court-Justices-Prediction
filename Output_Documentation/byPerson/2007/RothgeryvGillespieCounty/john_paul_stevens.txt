mr.
coleman,
may
i
just
ask
this
kind
of
simple
question.
if
the
prosecutor
had
participated
in
the
magistration,
then
under
texas
law
would
the
right
to
counsel
have
arisen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
the
prosecutor
participates
is
not
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
very
proceeding
in
this
case?
supposing
instead
of
a
detective
bringing
in
the
affidavit,
that
the
prosecutor
did
it,
had
the
detective's
affidavit,
and
the
prosecutor
said:
this
is
a
case
we
intend
to
pursue
more
seriously.
that's
all
he
says
to
the
judge.
would
have
that
been
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
got
the
impression
from
the
briefs
that
the
absence
or
presence
of
the
prosecutor
made
a
difference.
but
you're
telling
me
i'm
wrong
under
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
if
they
ask
for
them.
only
if
they
ask
for
the
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
i
wondered--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
on
texas
procedure.
supposing
after
the
magistration
he
wanted
to
have
the
charges
dismissed.
could
he
have
hired
a
lawyer
to
come
in
and
ask
the
judge
to
dismiss
the
charges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say
he
wanted
to
get
a
release
from
bond
and
said
he
wanted
to
terminate
his
custody.
is
there
any
procedure
whatsoever
available
to
a
defendant
to
say:
i
want
to
get
this
monkey
off
my
back
after
this
bond
premium?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
could
he
have
a
lawyer
appear
before
the
court
to
ask
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
judge
say:
you
got
to
appear
yourself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
prosecutor
said:
you
are
not
entitled
to
a
lawyer,
wouldn't
the
judge
have
said:
you're
crazy;
of
course,
he
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
to
come
in
for
this
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
talking
about
theoretical
problems
here,
and
the
question
is
whether
he
would
he
have
had
a
right
to
a
lawyer
asking
him
to
get
released
from
bond.
twenty
minutes
after
the
first
proceeding
ended
his
father
hired
a
lawyer
and
brought
him
in.
would
the
lawyer
have
been
allowed
to
appear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
he
is
paying
for
his
own
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
not
have
had
a
right
under
the
constitution
to
have
a
lawyer
come
in
and
say:
i
want
to
get
released
from
this
bond.
i
find
that
hard
to
believe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not
include
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
