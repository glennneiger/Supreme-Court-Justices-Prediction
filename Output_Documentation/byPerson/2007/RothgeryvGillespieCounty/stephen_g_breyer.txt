justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
law
on
that?
is
there...
suppose
there's
an
indictment
and
the
defendant
finds
out
about
it;
he's
never
arrested;
nothing
further
happens;
weeks
pass.
now,
is
there
any
law
that
tells
me...
it's
an
indictment,
that's
clear...
and
is
there
any
law
that
tells
me,
when
he
requests
a
counsel
be
appointed,
when
they
have
to
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
answer
is
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens...
what
happens
if...
the
part
that's
worrying
and
i
don't
know
how
people
handle
it...
a
riot.
a
big
sit-in.
a
big
demonstration,
500
people
arrested,
they
are
brought
down
to
the
station,
bail
is
posted
the
next
day,
the
u.s.
attorney
or
the
d.a.
thinks:
i'm
going
to
indict
the
ringleaders,
and
the
rest...
you
know,
the
rest
we
are
just
going
to
let
go;
they
will
forfeit
their
bond.
how
is
that
handled?
how
is
it
handled
under
your
rule?
how
is
that
handled
generally?
how
should
it
be
handled?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
that's
easy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean...
i'm
talking
about
the
people
who
nobody
ever
intends
to
prosecute.
what's
going
to
happen,
as
i
think
happens
quite
often,
they
are
brought
to
the
station,
they
are
arrested,
they
are
released
on
bond,
and
then
everybody
forgets
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
they're...
or
the
d.a.
says,
you
know,
forfeit...
like
a
traffic
ticket
or
something...
forfeit
your
bond.
and
i
want
to
know
how
that's
handled
under
your
rule,
how
is
it
handled
now,
how
is
it
handled
in
the...
discuss
it,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
see
what
i'm
doing.
i'm
trying
to
make
it
comparable.
what
happens
there
is
that
these
500
people
brought
down
to
the
station,
they
are
required
to
put
up
bail;
they
are
given
a
warning
because
people
might
question
them;
they
are
given
a
warning;
they
are
then
released.
and
nothing
further
is
heard.
maybe
three
months
later,
they
come
in
and
they
agree
that
they'll
forfeit
their
bond.
now,
that's
what
i'm
wondering.
that
must
happen,
because
i
think
there
are
lots
of
demonstrations;
they
occur
sometimes.
i
suspect
it
happens.
how
is
it
handled,
if
you
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
in
texas?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
counsel
right
would
attach?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
didn't...
they
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
law
here
in
texas
in
respect
to
this
particular
magistration
proceeding?
i
noticed
what
happened
is
that
the
magistrate
tells
the
person
arrested,
he
says
precisely:
"i
find
probable
cause
to
believe.
"
that
you...
"that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
you.
"
that's
what
they
say,
right?
it
said:
"i
have
determined
that
probable
cause
existed
for
the
arrest
of
the
individual
accused
therein.
"
all
right.
now,
what
happens...
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
the
answer
to
this...
in
what
might
be
a
rare
instance,
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
that
individual
when
he
was
arrested,
but
there
isn't
now.
so
because
he
came
in...
you
know,
he
said
here's
14
cousins,
i
was
somewhere
else
at
the
time,
they
all
agree.
i
mean,
everybody
agrees
on
a
certain
fact
that
means
there
isn't
now.
and
what
i'm
driving
at
is
does
the
magistrate
here...
is
he
required,
does
he
have
the
power
to
commit
someone,
even
though
he
honestly
believes
there
is
no
longer
probable
cause,
in
which
case
he
is
making
the
decision,
the
magistrate,
not
the
policeman?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
could...
i
can
think
there
would
be
tremendous
constitutional
significance
and
it
would
make
a
difference
if
all
that's
really
happening
is
a
policeman
is
arresting
someone,
in
which
case
we
might
have
liberty
interests
and
others
at
issue.
but
what's
happening
in
this
proceeding
is
that
the
magistrate
is
deciding
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
him,
in
which
case
it's
more
like,
not
completely
like,
but
more
like
what
happens
in
an
indictment
or
an
arraignment,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
i
want
to
know
what's
texas
law,
if
you
know
it,
in
respect
to
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
have
a
magistrate
who
has
to
find
that
there
is...
no,
to
make
the
arrest
or
to
hold
him
now?
do
you
see
what
i'm
doing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
see
why
i'm
doing
it?
so,
what's
the
answer,
if
you
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
know
there
may
not
be,
but
what
about
in
general.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's
what
i
would
think.
in
which
case
we
have
before
us
bringing
this
person
before
a
state
official
who
himself
has
the
power
to
decide
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
him,
and
he
is
saying,
yes,
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
him.
that's...
that's
what's
happening;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
were
to
say
that
where
the
state
arrests
an
individual,
brings
him
before
a
neutral
official
and
intends
and
does
impose
a
significant
restraint
on
his
liberty
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
that
individual
to
trial,
there
is
a
presumption
that
that...
forget
the
presumption.
if
that
happens
for
the
purpose,
the
primary
purpose,
primary
purpose
of
bringing
the
individual
to
trial,
at
that
point
the
sixth
amendment
right
attaches.
now,
the
state
would
not
have
to
give
him
a
lawyer
if
there
was
some
other
purpose
primary,
for
example,
as
in
gouveia,
keeping
the
prisons
safe.
for
example,
it's
quite
clear
under
the
circumstances,
there
are
14
people
accused,
they
couldn't
have
all
have
done
it,
they
want
to
investigate
further.
or
maybe
there
are
other
examples.
but,
for
the
primary
purpose,
then
the
right
attaches.
so
you
pick
up
gerstein
and
add
to
gerstein
that
additional
requirement.
what
about
that?
what
harm
would
that
cause?
what
inconvenience
would
it
cause,
what
difficulties,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
because
of
the
fact
that
bail...
if
you're
going
to
insist
on
bail,
that
in
effect
is
incarceration.
but
the
reason
i
asked
the
question,
which
i
would
ask
you
the
same,
is
there
are
a
lot
of
states,
we're
told,
that
do
have
counsel
attach
in
circumstances
similar
to
this.
so
they
must
have
some
way
of
dealing
with
the
problem
that
i
raised
if
it's
really
a
problem.
and
i
want
to...
and
that's...
and
i
want
to...
if
we're
going
into
this,
i
think
i
need
to
know
how
this
is
dealt
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
you
would
have
given
him
a
counsel.
i
mean,
in
fact,
if
he
had
wanted
one,
texas
would
give
him
one.
so
texas
must
have...
it
must
not
be
a
problem.
the
problem,
i
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
problem
i
raise
can't
be
a
real
problem.
