justice

scalia
or
the
incarceration.
would
your
case
be
different
if
after
the
magistration
the...
your
client
was
free
to
go?
the
court
said,
you
know,
this
is
what
you've
been
arrested
for
and
charged
with
by
the
policeman
who
brought
you
in;
we'll...
you
know,
good-bye.
whereas
in
this
case,
he
was
required
to
make
bail.
suppose
he
hadn't
been
required
to
make
bail,
supposing
he
was
free
to
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
texas...
assuming
we
agree
with
that,
texas
made
one
of
two
possible
constitutional
violations.
either
it
was
unconstitutional
for
texas
to
require
him
to
make
bail,
or
it
was
unconstitutional
for
texas
not
to
provide
him
with
an
attorney.
why
should...
why
should
we
find
that
the
latter
was
the
problem
rather
than
the
former?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
certainly
is
if
you're
not
charged.
i
think
it's
a
very
strong
point
in
your
favor
that
he
was
required
to
make
bail,
because
i
don't
think
you
can
hold
somebody
without
charging
him,
just
say,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
fact...
the
fact
that
he
was
held
suggests
that
he
was
charged
with
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe,
maybe
texas
was
wrong
about
that,
that
it
shouldn't
have
required
bail.
maybe
that
was
what
was
unconstitutional,
rather
than
its
failure
to
provide
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
it
solve
your...
the
problem
that
you're
obviously
wrestling
with,
if...
if
we
simply
said
there
is
a
right
to
counsel,
but
it
doesn't
attach
until
there's
a
significant
stage
of
the
prosecution
which
then
follows?
i
mean,
if
you
have
some
proceeding
afterwards,
yes,
then
you
do
need
a
lawyer,
but
the
mere
fact
that
you've
been
brought
to
the
courthouse
and
made
bail
and
let
go
does
not
require
500
counsel
to
be
provided.
only...
only
when
there
is
some
later
proceeding,
which
is
an
essential
part
of
the
prosecution,
must
you
have
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
that
solve
the
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
only
need
counsel
at
significant
phases.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it's
so
wrapped
up
with
how
we
decide
this
case.
i
mean,
if
i
think
that
counsel
has
to
be
appointed
right
away
for...
for
justice
breyer's
500
demonstrators,
i'm
going
to
give
a
different
answer
to
the
first
question.
but
if
i
know
that
counsel
doesn't
have
to
be
appointed
until
the
prosecution
proceeds
to
some
significant
phase
where
an
attorney
would
be...
would
be
really
helpful,
then...
then
i
can...
i
can
be
quite
more
sympathetic
to
your...
to
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
stage
would
arise
immediately
as
soon
as
the
magistration
was
completed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
he'd
have
to
have
counsel
appointed
immediately--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
advise
him
whether
to
ask
for
this
hearing
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
other
case
in
which
we've
held
that
it's
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
where
nothing
has
happened,
but
something
could
have
happened
if
the
defendant
had
asked
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
find
it
hard
to
describe
that
as
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
trial
occurs,
it
is
a
critical
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
claiming
that
his
decision
of
whether
to
ask
for
that
or
not
is
a
critical
stage.
and
i
just
don't
know
any
precedent
for
saying
that
something
that
hasn't
happened
is
a
critical
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
authority
do
you
have
to
hold
somebody
who's
not
been
charged?
i
mean
i
don't
understand
that.
you
say
he
hasn't
been
charged,
but
we're
going
to
hold
you
in
jail.
that's
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
a
problem
even
if
you
appoint
counsel.
you
say
you
can
keep
people
without
charging
them
so
long
as
you
give
them
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
coleman,
what
happens
in
other
jurisdictions?
i
probably
ought
to
know
this,
but
i
don't.
maybe
you
do.
when
you
don't
have
a
procedure
called
magistration,
but
someone
is
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
with
the
prosecutor
present,
is
the
indictment
at
that
point
drawn
up,
or
doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
prosecutor
have
some
time
to
decide
what
the
indictment
ought
to
contain?
what...
what
happens
at
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
happens
in
the
interim?
is
he...
is
he
charged
in
the
interim,
or
is
he
just
held
because
he
is
going
to
be
charged,
which
is
what's
going
on
here.
