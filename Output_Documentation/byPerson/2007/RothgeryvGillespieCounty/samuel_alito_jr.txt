what
does
"attachment"
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well
if
mr.
roth...
if
your
client
had
shown
up
at
the
magistration
with
an
attorney,
could
the
state
of
texas
have
said,
no,
your
attorney
may
not
be
present
during
the
magistration?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
that
the
right
attached
prior
to
the
magistration?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
at
the
beginning,
at
the
end?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
why
could
texas
have
said
your
attorney...
why
could
texas
have
not
said,
although
you
came
here
with
an
attorney,
your
attorney
may
not
be
present
because
you
don't
have
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
at
the
magistration?
your
right
hasn't
attached
yet.
it
won't
attach
until
the
end.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
when
do
you
say
counsel
has
to
be
appointed?
is
it
before
the
magistration?
is
it
at
the
end,
immediately
upon
the
end
of
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if...
what
if
an
attorney
had
been
appointed
here
ten
days
after
the
magistration?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
texas
law
provided
that
there
had
to
be
an
examining
trial
within
a
certain
period
of
time
after
the
magistration
unless
there
was
an
intervening
indictment.
then
would
you
not
agree
that
under
those
circumstances
the
defendant
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
shortly
after
the
magistration,
at
least
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
examining
trial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
the
situation
be
different
simply
because
texas
law
doesn't
require
the
examining
trial,
but
gives
the
defendant
the
option
of
demanding
one?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--why
is
the
question
of
whether
the
right
attaches,
which
seems
to
mean
different
things
in
different
situations,
a
separate
question
from
what
i
would
think
would
be
the
question
here:
whether
he
had
the
right
to
have
counsel
appointed
for
him.
why
isn't
that
the
question,
and
"attachment"
is
simply
a
label
that
is
used
to
express
one
of
the
conditions
for
having
the
right
to
appoint
a
counsel?
