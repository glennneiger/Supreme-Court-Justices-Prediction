justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
spinelli,
there's
something
confusing
about
your
presentation
of
this,
because
you
say
that
at
this
initial
appearance
that's
called
a
magistration,
you
are
not
contending
that
there
was
a
right
to
counsel
at
that
very
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
when,
at
what
point
in
time,
did
this
right
to
counsel
attach?
if
it
didn't
attach
during
that
magistration
proceeding,
when
did
it
attach?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
taking
the
position
that
there
was
a
right
to
counsel
that
attached
in
this
case.
and
i'm
asking
you
at
what
point
in
time
that
right
attached.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
at
the
magistration,
and
you...
you
have
said
that
there
was
no
right
to
counsel
at
the
magistration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
time
prior...
any
time
prior
to
indictment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
that
that
is
the
critical
stage
that
he
needed
to
have
counsel's
advice
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
filed
by
the
police?
what
was
filed
by
the
police--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
justify
holding
this
person?
you
can't
just
say
the
police
brought
someone
in
and
they
get
locked
up
in
jail.
the
police
had
to
present
something--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
show
probable
cause
and
it
was
the
burden
of
the
state
in
the
presence
of
the
police
officer
to
prove
probable
cause.
so
that
had
to
be
based
on
something.
what
was
it
based
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then...
and
then
the
defendant
was
told
or
was
given
miranda
warnings.
what
was
said
to
him
precisely
about
right
to
counsel
in
the
warnings
that
the
magistrate
gave
him?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
if
he
is
told...
the
defendant
is
listening
to
this.
and,
magistrate,
you
just
told
me
i
have
a
right
to
counsel.
okay,
i
would
like
counsel.
and
then
the
magistrate
says,
no
you're
not
entitled
to
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you...
i
thought
you
recognized
that
if
he
had
opted
to
have
this
examining
trial
to
determine
whether
there
really
was
probable
cause,
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
counsel
at
that
examining
trial.
and,
yet,
that's
detached
from
the
fair
trial.
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
that
they
will
never
get
to
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
that
he
is
out
on
bail,
but
he
has
a
suspicion
that
this
alleged
felony...
that
that
wasn't
cricket
because
it
was
expunged.
so
he
says
to
the
judge:
judge,
i
want
to
contest
my
being
held
to
some
kind
of
criminal
process
because
there
is
no
basis
for
the
charge.
so
he
is
out
on
bail.
he
has
no
lawyer,
but
he
wants
to
contest
the
state's
right
to
hold
him
at
all,
and
he
asks
for
a
lawyer
to
help
him
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
then
episodic?
that
is,
if
the
right
is
turned
on
when
there
is
a
critical
event,
and
then
the
critical
event
is
over,
and
no
more
right
to
counsel
until
the
next
critical
event?
it's
not...
you
have
no
right
to
counsel
in
between
those
critical
events?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
only
need
this
one
critical
stage,
and
then
you
get
appointed
counsel
at
that
stage,
and
that
counsel
will
continue
thereafter.
you
don't
have
to--
