ms.
danielle
spinelli
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
brewer
and
jackson,
this
court
held
that
an
initial
appearance
before
a
magistrate
like
the
one
here
marks
the
commencement
of
a
criminal
prosecution
under
the
sixth
amendment.
this
case
demonstrates
why
that
holding
makes
eminent
sense.
rothgery
was
arrested
on
the
erroneous
belief
that
he
was
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
as
required
by
the
texas
code,
he
was
brought
before
a
magistrate,
who
informed
him
of
the
felony
accusation
against
him
and
required
him
to
post
bail
or
remain
in
jail
to
ensure
that
he
answered
that
accusation.
at
that
point,
rothgery
acquired
specific
rights
under
texas
law
as
the
accused
in
a
felony
case,
including
the
right
to
have
the
prosecution
against
him
dismissed
if
an
indictment
or
information
were
not
filed
within
a
set
period
and
the
right
to
contest
the
accusation
against
him
prior
to
indictment
in
an
examining
trial
before
the
magistrate.
at
that
point,
rothgery
was
no
longer
merely
a
suspect,
but
an
accused
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
held
in
jackson
that
the
question
whether
a
particular--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
there
is
a
clear
distinction
which
is
set
forth
in
this
court's
opinion
in
jackson
between
the
question
whether
a
particular
proceeding
initiates
a
criminal
prosecution
and
whether
that
proceeding
itself
is
adversarial
in
the
sense
that
it
requires
the
presence
of
defense
counsel.
and,
as
to
the
first
question,
whether
a
particular
proceeding
initiates
a
criminal
prosecution,
this
court's
cases
have
not
held
that
prosecutorial
involvement
is
a
relevant
factor,
and
that--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
don't
contend
that
it
is
adversarial.
in
jackson,
this
court
made
clear
that
a
proceeding
need
not
itself
be
adversarial
in
the
sense
that
would
require
defense
counsel
to
be
present
to
counter
the
adversary
presentation
of
the
prosecutor
in
order
for
that
proceeding
to
initiate
a
criminal
prosecution.
rather,
it
held
that
the
initial
appearance
itself,
regardless
of
those
other
factors,
marked
the
commencement
of
a
prosecution.
and
it's
worth
noting
that
in
jackson
substantially
the
same
arguments
that
respondent
raises
here
were
made
by
the
state
there.
the
state
there
contended
this
initial
appearance
is
merely
an
administrative
ministerial
proceeding.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well,
the
court
in
jackson
placed
no
weight
on
that
distinction.
that
wasn't
something
that
was
mentioned
in
jackson.
and
what
happened
in
jackson
was
that
warrants
were
obtained,
the
defendants
were
arrested,
and
they
were
brought
before
a
magistrate
for
this
initial
proceeding.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
prosecutor
was
present
at
that
initial
proceeding.
the
jackson
court...
the
jackson
court
put
no
weight
on
that
factor.
and
none
of
this
court's
cases
have
ever
stated
that
there
is
a
requirement
that
a
prosecutor
be
involved.
and
that
makes
sense,
because
the
consequences
of
the
initial
appearance
for
the
defendant
are
precisely
the
same
whether
or
not
a
prosecutor
is
involved.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
had
there
been
no
way
in
which
the
defendant
was
bound
to
reappear
and
answer
the
charges,
then
we
would
not
have
the
situation
that
we
have,
and
it
would
seem
less
likely
that
that
would
initiate
a
criminal
proceeding.
the
factors
that
we
have
here
that
make
it
clear
that
a
prosecution
was
initiated,
just
as
it
was
in
jackson
on
identical
facts--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well,
first
i
should
say
i
believe
that
that
question
goes
to
respondent's
alternative
argument
for
affirmance.
the
only
question
that
was
addressed
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
only
question
presented
in
the
petition
was
the
question
whether
a
criminal
prosecution
commenced
at
rothgery's
magistration.
and
we
are
certainly
not
asking
this
court
to
direct
the
entry
of
judgment
in
our
favor,
but
merely--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--we
believe
that...
well,
this
court's
cases
have
made
clear
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
at
the
time
a
criminal
prosecution
commences.
now,
the
question
whether
counsel
must
then
be
appointed
immediately
upon
attachment
is
a
separate
question.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
what
"attachment"
means
under
this
court's
cases
is
that
since
a
criminal
prosecution
has
now
begun,
the
explicit
guarantees
of
the
sixth
amendment
are
applicable,
the
state
no
longer...
the
state
cannot
interfere
after
that
point
with
the
attorney-client
relationship.
at
that
point
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
counsel
to
serve
as
an
intermediary--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
because--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--we
believe
that
the
right
attached
at
the
magistration.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
upon
the
magistration.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
so
perhaps...
so
at
the
end...
i
suppose
i
would
say
at
the
end,
once--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--well,
i
believe
that
it
would
attach
at
the
time
that
the
magistrate
informed
the
defendant
of
the
accusation
against
him,
at
which
point
he
became
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
and
his
right
to
counsel
attached.
now,
to
get
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
whether...
whether
counsel
is
required
to
be
appointed
immediately
upon
attachment
is
a
separate
issue,
which
is
the
subject
of
respondent's
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
we
are
merely
asking
this
court
to
resolve
the
threshold
question,
which
is
the
threshold
question
in
every
right
to
counsel
case,
did
a
criminal
prosecution
commence
at
rothgery's
magistration?
ms.
danielle
spinelli
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
this
court
has
said
that
a
defendant
does
not
have
a
right
for
a
lawyer
to
act
as
a
pre-charge
private
investigator.
but
our
contention
is
that
rothgery
was
charged
at
his
magistration.
at
that
point
he
became
an
accused,
which
is
demonstrated
by
the
structure
of
the
texas
code
itself.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
it's
very
different
from
a
traffic
ticket,
justice
kennedy,
because
in
that
situation...
i
think
that
situation
would
be
analogous
to
a
warrantless
arrest,
which,
as
we
know,
does
not
commence
adversary
judicial
proceedings.
here,
we
have
an
arrest.
we
have
a
person
who
has
been
held
for
a
period
of
time--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
it's
the
magistration.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
if
he
had
not
been
required
to
make
bail
or
make
any
other
binding
promise
to
appear,
which
is
the
function
of
bail,
to
ensure
that
the
defendant
will
answer
the
accusation--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--then
we
would
be
lacking
that
piece
of
evidence
that
he
had
been
accused.
there
still
would
remain
other
evidence
under
texas
law
that
he
was,
in
fact,
an
accused
at
that
time.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well,
there
is
certainly
nothing
unconstitutional
about
requiring
bail,
as
we
know.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well,
we...
i
mean,
we--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--we
agree,
justice
scalia.
in
fact,
the
texas
code
expressly
recognizes
that
the
function
of
bail
is
to
ensure
that
the--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--accused
will
answer
the
accusation
against
him.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well,
what
occurred
here,
however,
was
that
texas
did
require
mr.
rothgery
to
post
bail.
and
in
addition,
the
magistration
gave
rise
to
certain
specific
rights,
which
only
accrued
to
defendants
in
criminal
prosecutions.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
we're
not
contending
that
an
attorney
was
required.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
i
think
the
rule...
we're
actually
not
asking
the
court
to
adopt
any
new
rule
today,
but
simply
to
reaffirm
the
rule
it
has
already
announced
in
brewer
and
jackson,
which
is
that
an
initial
appearance
before
a
magistrate,
which
is
a
proceeding
that
is
common
across
jurisdictions
and
has
a
common
significance
across
jurisdictions,
a
proceeding
at
which
a
magistrate
informs
the
defendant
officially
of
the
accusation
against
him
and
of
his
rights
as
a
criminal
defendant--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--no,
we
believe--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--our
contention
is
that
an
attorney
was
required
to
be
appointed
promptly
after
rothgery
renewed
his
request
for
an
attorney
following
the
magistration.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
and
this
court--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--correct,
justice
souter.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
that's
our
contention.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
not
at
all.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
no,
not
at
all.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
no.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
that's
correct.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
justice
breyer,
this
court
has
not
been
faced
with
the
question--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--right.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
how
is
it
handled
with
respect
to
the
persons
who
were
indicted?
ms.
danielle
spinelli
or
how
is
it--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--if
there
are--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--if
a
person
is
arrested,
brought
to
the
station
house,
and
then
released
prior
to
the
initial
appearance,
which
is
actually
a--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--it
happens
quite
frequently,
justice
breyer,
that
persons
are
arrested,
brought
to
the
station
house,
and
then
released
by
the
police
without
undergoing
an
initial
appearance.
and
in
that
circumstance,
we
don't
contend
that
a
prosecution
would
have
begun.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well,
it...
it
might
depend
on
the
manner
in
which
the
charges
are
conveyed
or
filed.
if
all
that
happens
is
that
the
police
tell
you,
you
know,
we
believe
you've
committed
a
crime,
certainly
that
doesn't
commence
a
prosecution.
if
there
is
a
formal...
you
know,
as
happens
in
misdemeanor
prosecutions,
if
there
is
a
formal
complaint
filed
which
can
be
the
basis
for
a
conviction
in
a
misdemeanor
case,
then
it
may
be
that,
by
analogy
to
an
indictment
in
a
felony
case,
a
prosecution
would
commence
at
that
point.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
i
don't
believe--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--i
believe...
i
believe
a
ticket
or
a
citation
of
that
nature
would
not
commence
adversary
judicial
proceedings
because
it's
analogous
to
a
warrantless
arrest.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--first
of
all,
we
agree
that
a
prosecution
commences
upon
a
first
appearance
before
a
judge--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--not
merely--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--oh,
right.
and
we
are
not
contending
that
counsel
must
be
present
at
that
initial
appearance
itself.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
so
just
to
be
clear
about
that.
but
to
address
your
question,
which,
again,
i
believe
goes
to
respondent's
alternative
ground
for
affirmance--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--well,
were
the
court
to
reach
that
alternative
argument,
which
is
that...
despite
the
fact
that
a
criminal
prosecution
had
commenced,
and
rothgery
was
an
accused,
by
hypothesis
he
nevertheless
was
not
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense
because
no
critical
stage
had
been
reached...
we
would
say,
first
of
all,
assuming
that
respondent
is
correct,
that
the
right
to
counsel
lies
dormant
following
its
attachment
on
the
commencement
of
a
criminal
prosecution
until
some
subsequent
critical
stage
is
reached,
if
we
assume
that
that
is
correct,
there
was
such
a
stage
here
because
mr.
rothgery
was
faced
with
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
invoke
his
right
to
an
examining
trial.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
but
his
decision
regarding
the
examining
trial
was
not
one
that
needed
to
be
made
at
the
magistration.
rather,
this
was
a
right
that
he
possessed
to
contest
the
accusation
against
him
under
texas
law,
which
could
only
be
exercised
prior
to
indictment.
and,
indeed,
it
was
a--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--correct.
and,
indeed--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--to
the
extent
that
it's
necessary
to
have
a
critical
stage,
then
we
believe
that
is
a
critical
stage.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
his
right--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--well--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--not
necessarily
immediately,
but
within
some
reasonable
time
after
his
request,
and
after
he
had
demonstrated--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--well,
i
mean,
had
he
said...
had
he
waived
his
right
to
an
examining
trial,
which
he
didn't
do,
then,
you
know,
under...
then
we
would
not
have--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--yes.
we're
contending
that
in
felony
cases...
this
is
only
an
issue
in
felony
cases...
because
texas
has
provided
this
right,
which
is
precisely
for
defendants
in
rothgery's
situation,
who
are
innocent
but--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--no.
that's
actually
not
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
at
a
magistration--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--precisely
what
he
said
and
what
appears
on
the
warning
form
is:
in
a
felony
case,
you
have
a
right
to
an
examining
trial.
there
is
no
provision
at
the
magistration
for
the
defendant
to
either
invoke
or
waive
that
right.
and
there's
no
indication
that
any
further
explanation
of
that
right
is
given.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well,
we're
not
contending
that.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
we're
not
contending
that,
justice
scalia.
our
contention
is
that
the
examining
trial,
this
court
has
already
held
in
coleman,
is
a
critical
stage.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
correct.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
and--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--i
think
the
strongest
precedent
for
that
is
estelle
versus
smith,
in
which
this
court
held
that
counsel...
counsel's
assistance
is
needed
not
only
to
conduct
and
prepare
for
critical
stages,
but
also
to
assist
a
defendant
in
deciding
whether
to
undergo
them.
and
more
broadly,
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
one
of
the
core
purposes
of
the
right
to
counsel
is
to
ensure
that
the
defendant
understands
and
is
able
to
invoke
all
of
his
rights.
and
in
this
case,
this
was
the
right
that
he
possessed
that
could
have
enabled
him
to
demonstrate
his
innocence
prior
to
being
indicted,
rearrested,
and
incarcerated.
and
he
lost
that
right
because
he
didn't
have
counsel's
help.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
this
was
a
warrantless
arrest,
but
following
that--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--but
there
was
more,
because
following
that,
there
was...
the
magistration
occurred,
at
which
time
the
police
officer
filed
an
affidavit
setting
forth
the
basis
of
the
charges.
the
magistrate
found
probable
cause,
and
the
magistrate
officially
informed
rothgery
of
the
accusation
against
him.
and
that's
why...
that's
why...
in
kirby,
this
court
held
this
a
warrantless
arrest
does
not
commence
adversary
judicial
proceedings;
in
jackson,
on
exactly
these
facts,
the
court
held
that
it
does.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
charges
were
filed
in
jackson
in
exactly
the
same
sense
that
charges
were
filed
here.
a
document
which
contained
basically
simply
a
factual
statement
of
what
had
occurred--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--that's
correct,
but
we
don't
believe
that
should
make
any
difference
because
the
effect
on
the
defendant
of
this
proceeding
is
precisely
the
same,
whether
or
not
a
prosecutor
is
involved.
and
that's
true
in
general
and
it's
true
under
texas
law.
either
way
he's
faced
with
a
need
to
negotiate
criminal
law
in
order
to
contest
the
charges
against
him.
he
has
a
right
to
do
so
under
texas
law,
and
he
has
a
right
to
have
the
prosecution
against
him
dismissed
if
an
indictment
isn't
filed
within
a
set
period.
all
of
which
we
believe
demonstrate
that
he
was
accused
and
that
a
prosecution
had
commenced.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
ms.
danielle
spinelli
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
kennedy.
it's
correct
that
gerstein
says
that
the
probable-cause
determination
made
under
gerstein
is
not,
itself,
a
critical
stage,
and
we
are
not
contending
otherwise.
the
gerstein
determination
is
something
separate
from
the
initial
appearance
that
occurred
here.
a
gerstein
determination
is
made
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
an
arrest.
it
can
be
made
ex
parte.
it's
essentially
the
equivalent
of
what
happens
prior
to
arrest
when
a
magistrate
decides
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
issue
a
warrant.
what
happened
here,
by
contrast,
was
after
arrest
and
after
the
police
had
decided
to...
mr.
rothgery,
he
was
brought
before
a
magistrate.
he
was
officially
informed
of
the
accusation
against
him,
and
at
that
time
he
acquired
the
right
to
contest
the
accusation
against
him
in
an
examining
trial,
which
we
believe
shows
that
he
was
accused
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
a
prosecution
had
begun.
and
we
are
not
contending
that
that
initial
proceeding
was,
itself,
a
critical
stage
where
counsel
was
required;
and
it's
not
necessary
to
contend
that
in
order
to
prevail
on
the
point
that
that
was
when
a
prosecution
commenced,
which
is
the
only
question
that
we
believe
is
properly
before
this
court
and
the
only
one
we
are
asking
it
to
resolve.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well,
i
mean
i
think
you
are
suggesting,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
reaffirming
the
rule
adopted
in
jackson
would
create,
you
know,
a
perverse
incentive
for
states
to
do
away
with
this
proceeding.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case
because,
as
justice
breyer
observed,
45
jurisdictions
already
follow
the
rule
of
appointing
counsel
at,
or
immediately
following,
the
initial
appearance,
which
the...
any
cdl
brief
lays
out
and
which
neither
respondent
nor
its
state
amici
have
contested.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
the
initial
appearance
serves
a
specific,
substantive
purpose
which
i
think
is
well
described
in
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
armstrong
cited
on
page
15
of
our
reply
brief,
which
is
this
is
the
proceeding
at
which
the
defendant
is
informed:
you
are
now
a
criminal
defendant.
this
is
the
accusation
against
you,
and
these
are
your
rights
as
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
for
that
reason,
as
the
armstrong
decision
says,
it
is
commonly
recognized
across
jurisdictions
as
the
inception
of
a
formal
prosecution,
and
we
believe
that's
the
rule
that
this
court
has
already
laid
out
in
brewer
and
jackson
and
should
reaffirm
today.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
of
course,
absolutely.
i
mean,
just
to
respond
to
one
other
question
that
arose
during
the
course
of
respondent's
argument,
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
that
in
texas,
as
in
other
jurisdictions,
there
are
two
phases
in
a
felony
prosecution.
there
is
an
initial
phase
that
commences
in
a
magistrate
court
where
a
document
setting
out
the
charges
will
be
filed
either
by
the
police
or
by
a
prosecutor,
and
the
magistrate
at
that
point
has
jurisdiction
over
that
criminal
case.
it
is
only
later
that
an
indictment
or
information
will
be
filed
in
the
general
trial
court
with
jurisdiction
to
enter
final
judgment.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
the
notion
that
a
prosecution
begins
only
in
that
second
phase.
it
rejected
it
expressly
in
moore.
it
rejected
it
in
coleman,
in
brewer,
in
jackson,
and
in
statements
in
kirby
and
mcneil.
so
that
can't
be
the
rule.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
thank
you.
