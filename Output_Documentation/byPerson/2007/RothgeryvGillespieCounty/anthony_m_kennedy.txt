justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
we're
looking
for
here,
at
least
one
of
the
things
we
might
look
for
in
this
case,
is
a
specific
rule
to
give
to
the
states
so
the
state
knows
when
counsel
has
to
be
appointed.
in
this
case
suppose
the
magistrate,
the
man
behind
the
little
window,
said:
we're
going
to
give
you
a
ticket;
keep
in
touch
with
us;
don't
change
your
address
until
you
notify
us;
you're
free
on
your
own
recognizance.
would
counsel
have
been
required
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
that
different
from
a
traffic
ticket?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
the
warrant
that
makes
the
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
a
magistrate
is
required
whenever
bail
is
set...
pardon
me,
that
an
attorney
is
required
whenever
bail
is
set?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
rule
is...
i
want
to
know,
what
do
we
tell
texas
it
has
to
do
in
all
these
cases?
what
do
we
tell
jurisdictions
that
have
to
deal
with
traffic
tickets?
does
it
make
a
difference
that
you're
held
in
custody
or
not
held
in
custody?
i
don't
understand
the
rule
you
want
us
to
adopt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
my
traffic
ticket?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i've
never
had
one
so
i
don't
know
what
they
say.
[laughter]
other
members
of
the
court
can
advise
me
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know...
when
we
were
talking
about
traffic
tickets,
you
said,
well,
that
was
a
warrantless
arrest.
this
was
a
warrantless
arrest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
how
could
they
hold
them
in
jail?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
was
held
after
he
saw
the
magistrate.
suppose
he
had
been
held
for
three
months
and
you
couldn't
make
bail,
we
don't
need
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
asking
what
the
constitutional
rule
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
have
here
a
proceeding
before
a
magistrate;
this
results
in
custody.
and
my
question
is,
suppose
this
were
weeks,
would
counsel
be
required
to
be
appointed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
said
that
when
a
defendant
is
ordered
held
in
custody,
that
there
is
then
a
right
of
counsel,
would
we
be
contradicting
any
of
our
precedents
as
opposed,
say,
to
extending
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
no.
but
my
assumption
was
assuming
that
the
defendant
is
remanded
to
custody.
i
added
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me...
can
you
give
me
some
idea,
or
some
empirical
assessment,
or
tell
me
where
i
could
go
to
find
out,
as
we
sit
here,
how
many
people
are
being
held
in
custody
after
a
probable-cause
determination
and
do
not
have
counsel
appointed
for
them
and
do
not
have
the
right
to
have
counsel
appointed
to
them
until
some
other
critical
phase
takes
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
there
was
just
a
misapplication
of
the
statute
here
when
this
man
was
held
for
three
days,
and
then
he
requested
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
first
phase
before
there
was
an
indictment,
just
the
probable-cause
phase.
you
say
even
then
there
is...
under
this
texas
statute
there
is
a
right
to
have
counsel
in
one
day?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
i
am
not
sure
why
we
are
having
this
discussion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
our
precedents
do
say,
gerstein
versus
pugh,
that
the
probable-cause
hearing
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding
where
counsel
is
required;
and
if
we
are
going
to
give
you
relief,
we
have
to
go
beyond
what
gerstein
says.
