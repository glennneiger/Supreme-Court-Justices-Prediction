mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
magistration
that
follows
every
texas
arrest
does
not
begin
a
criminal
prosecution
under
the
sixth
amendment.
when
rothgery
was
magistrated,
no
formal
charges
had
been
filed
against
him;
no
one
attempted
to
elicit
incriminating
information
from
him;
no
witnesses
were
presented--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--it
is
not
uncommon...
in
fact,
it's
universal
practice
that
when
one
is
arrested
on
a...
without
a
warrant,
it
is
normally
because
a
police
officer
sees
an
individual
in
the
commission
of
a
crime.
it's
not
uncommon
to
go
and
to
arrest
that
person,
to
cease
the
crime
that
is
taking
place
and
perhaps
to
prevent
other
crimes
from
taking
place,
and
to
present
them.
gerstein
makes
clear
that
this
happens
all
of
the
time.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
texas
statute
allows
for
counsel
under
that
situation.
but
this
is
an
issue
that
is
addressed
primarily
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
fourth--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
your
honor.
the
fourth--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we
believe
that
this
is
an
issue
that
was
addressed
by
the
court
in
gerstein
and
mclaughlin,
that
the
fourth
amendment
prevents
unreasonable
seizures
and
the
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
rights
kick
in.
and
so
there
is
a
limit
on
what
type
of
a
seizure
that
can
you
have.
and
the
fourth
amendment
does
prevent
that,
as
do
other
rights,
and
as
the
court
recognized
in
gouveia.
but
the
liberty
interest
that
is
at
stake
there,
as
the
court
said
in
gouveia,
is
not
one
that
implicates
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
if
there
are
other--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--gerstein
says
that
there
must
be--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that
could
not
happen
in
texas.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
would
be...
not
be
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
might
well
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
other
sixth
amendment--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
happens
all
the
time,
justice
scalia,
where
people
are
appointed
counsel
but,
for
whatever
reason,
do
not
make
bail
and--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
think
gerstein
would
prevent
that,
justice
souter.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that's
absolutely
true
here.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
constitutional
significance
of
the
different--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--what
is
stated
on
the
form...
certainly
i
can't
say
what
was
going
through
the
magistrate's
mind.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
answer
i
believe
is
that
you...
that
you
find
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
do
see
what
you're
doing.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
difference
in
this
case.
i
think--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--magistrates
have
a
great
amount
of
discretion,
and
i
think
if
a
magistrate
was
convinced
that
probable
cause
existed
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
not
now,
it's
quite
likely
the
magistrate
would
find--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
believe
so.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
required
in
gerstein,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
there
is
no
role
for
a
prosecutor
at
a
magistration
under
article
1517
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that's
possible.
and
i
would
like
to
amend
my
answer
to
you,
justice
stevens.
it's
not
at
all
uncommon...
once
an
arrest
takes
place
and
an
officer
can
go
and
present
a
case
to
the
county
or
district
attorney,
it's
not
uncommon
at
all
for
charges
then
to
be
filed
in
the...
depending
on
what
the
crime,
is
in
the
district
court
or
county
court,
and
for
the
magistration
then
to
be
moved
over
and
to
take
place
in
an
official
court.
and
so
at
that
time,
it
could
very
well
be.
and
we
would
say...
we
would
say
likely
at
that
point
that,
yes,
that
formal
criminal
judicial
proceedings
had
initiated,
and
it's
not
uncommon.
but
in
this
circumstance--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
an
expression
of
subjective--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--under
the
circumstances
where
no
formal
charges
have
been
brought,
a
statement
by
a
prosecutor
that
they
are
looking
at
it
or
that
they
intend
to
bring
some
is
not
itself
the
initiation
of
formal
adversary
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
an
indictment
does
usually
take
a
little
bit
more
time
because
it
has
to
be
taken
and
presented
to
a
grand
jury.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
he
is
not
charged
during
that
interim.
but
you
can
have--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
justice
souter.
texas
statutes
do
allow
for
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
some
circumstances.
it's
not
frequently
used.
but
that's
a
complaint
that
has
to
be
filed
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
court.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
nothing
was
filed.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
was
based
on
the
officer's
affidavit
of
probable
cause,
which
was
presented
at
the
little
glass
window
to
the
magistrate
and--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
the
warnings
go
through.
they
are
very
similar
to
miranda
warnings.
he
is
told
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
under
texas
statute
for
this.
he
is...
he
is
warned,
as
ms.
spinelli
said,
about
examining
trial.
there
is
a
list
of
things--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
think
that's
what
would
happen.
i
think
if
he
had
insisted
on
counsel
being
present
for
the
bail
portion
of
the
1517
magistration,
i
believe
that
they
would
have
gotten
somebody
to
come
and--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--under
texas
statute
they
would.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
completely
agree
that
if
that
were
the
case,
coleman...
this
court's
decisions
make
absolutely
clear
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
counsel
for
an
examining
trial
and
would
have
been...
we
would
have
been
obligated
and
would
have
appointed
counsel
at
a
reasonable
time
before
that
examining
trial
so
that
the
preparations
could
take
place.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
because
there
is
no
prejudice
to
your
fair
trial
rights
from
not
choosing
to
have
an
examining
trial.
we
are
unaware
of
any
case
that
has
said
that
there
is
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
consult
with
counsel
before
deciding
whether
to
ask
for
an
examining
trial.
and
in
fact,
in
texas
they
are
very
rare
because
in
the
very
unusual
circumstances
where
somebody
asks
for
one,
more
often
than
not
the
prosecutor
will
simply
hurry
up
and
do
an
indictment.
and
so
there
will
be
no
examining
trial
that
takes
place.
and
that's
a
put
up
or
shut
up
procedure,
but
it's
not
something
that
prejudices
your
fair
trial
rights
if
no
examining
trial
actually
takes
place.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
certainly
do
believe
that
the
court
would.
i
believe
that
a
decision
that
the
right
attaches,
that
there
is
an
initiation
of
formal
judicial
proceedings
at
the
magistration,
would
contradict
not
only
kirby,
but
also
gerstein
and
gouveia.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
that
makes
a
constitutional
difference
in
our
circumstances.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i...
i
think
the
primary
issue
with
that,
justice
breyer,
is
that
it
contradicts
what
the
court
said
in
gouveia.
the
court
went
through
a
lengthy
exegesis
in
gouveia
about
what
interests
in
particular
are
protected
and
talked
about
this,
this
expression
of
a
concern
about
our
liberty
interests;
and
that
the
purpose
issue
was
not
something
that
the
court
addressed
there.
it
simply
said
that
our
fourth
amendment
precedents
go
to
the
liberty
interests.
our
sixth
amendment
speedy-trial
and
other
precedents
go
to
the
liberty
interests.
the
right
to
counsel
is
not
specifically
a
liberty-interest
protection.
it
is
something,
as
chief
justice
roberts
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
something
that
protects
your
right
to
a
fair
trial.
and
there
are...
there
are
proceedings
that
take
place
along
the
way
that
the
court
has
held
are
critical
stages,
and
we
need
and
want
counsel
to
be
present
for
them,
and
so
we
have
so
dictated.
but
getting
behind--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no.
i...
i
disagree
with
that.
coleman
itself
says
that
the
reason
we're
requiring
counsel
for
a
preliminary
hearing
or
an
examining
trial,
as
we
call
it
in
texas,
is
precisely
because
there
will
be
witnesses,
there
will
be
arguments
made;
and
you
could
waive
defenses
if
not
made
there;
that
this
is
very
important.
so
we're
going
to
define
even,
this
examining
trial
or
preliminary
hearing,
even
though
it
comes
before
an
indictment,
we're
going
to
define
that
as
an
event
of
attachment
solely
because
your
right
to
a
fair
trial
could
very
much
be
prejudiced
there.
and
that...
that
doesn't
exist
in
this
case,
and
that
certainly
the
failure
to
ask
for
a
examining
trial
does
not
prejudice
your
right
to
a
fair
trial.
justice
breyer,
you
asked
a
hypothetical
that
i
would
like...
i
would
like
to
address
because
it
is
something
that
happens
all
the
time,
and
i
think
should
inform
the
court's
decision
here.
and,
that
is,
it
is
not
uncommon,
and
some
statistics
that
i
have
seen
suggest
that
it
may
happen
in
half
of
the
cases,
where
an
individual
is
arrested,
magistrated,
released,
and
no
charges
are
ever
brought.
so
the
bulk
of
your
500
protesters
are
never
brought.
under
mr.
rothgery's
view
of
the
sixth
amendment,
the
county...
you
know,
let's
say
somebody
is
protesting
whitetail
deer
hunting
in
gillespie
county.
the
county
would
be
required
to
appoint
counsel
for
all
of
those
individuals
even
though--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if
they
ask
for
them.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
if...
if
the
court
were
to
make
a
rule
that
depended
solely
on
incarceration,
that
is
true.
i
don't
understand
mr.
rothgery
to
be
making
that
argument
because
he
was
released
on
bond.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that
amicus
brief
attempts
to
suggest
that
texas's
statute
is
very
different
from
statutes
that
exist
in
other
cases...
in
other
states,
and
that's
simply
not
true,
your
honor.
i
do
not
understand
what
happens
in
each
of
those...
in
each
of
those
states,
but
i
have
at
least
seen
decisions
in
some
of
those
states
that
suggest
that
they
don't
act
that
much
differently
than
we
do,
and
that...
that
they
do
apply
a
critical-stage-type
analysis
in
evaluating--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--you
mean
at
the
magistration?
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
if
he
would
have
asked
for
one,
he
would
have
gotten
one.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
absolutely
not,
justice
stevens.
there
were
no
charges
pending.
this...
this
magistration
that
occurs
in
the
jail
is
simply--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--a
release
from
bond,
it
would
have
theoretically
been
possible,
yes.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
think
the
judge
would
have
said:
you
have
to
appear
yourself.
i
think
he
could
have
personally
come
forth--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
that's
an
issue
that
doesn't
come
up
because
judges
don't
exclude--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--the
difference
between
the
sixth
amendment
strict
requirements
and
practicalities
is
a
significant
one.
i
don't
think
the
sixth
amendment
would
necessarily
have
required
it.
the...
i
am
aware--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--it
is
the
same
as
every
other--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--situation.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
he
would
have...
he
would
have
the
same
rights
as
anybody
else,
whether
retained
or--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--it
would
not
be
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
there
could
be
a
right
if
you
otherwise
have
a
lawyer;
that
the
state
cannot
exclude
that
lawyer
from
participating
on
your
behalf.
but
it
would
not
be
an
"attachment",
an
"appointment"
issue,
where
you
are
entitled
to
appointment
of
counsel
to
do
that.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
if...
if
he
were
to
ask
somebody,
he
would
be
told
that
you
can
ask
for
an
examining
trial.
if
you
ask
for
that,
we
will
appoint
you
a
lawyer;
and
you
will
have
your
examining
trial
unless
the
state
decides
to
indict
before
we
actually
get
to
it.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
have
given
this
great
thought,
justice
alito.
in
my
mind,
the
only
doctrinal
difference
it
really
makes
is
the
situation
that
this
court
has
described
in
michigan
v.
jackson,
which
i
have
previously
addressed
in
the
cobb
case
which
i
argued.
but
in
most
other
circumstances
we
think
that
the
analysis
is
essentially
the
same,
because
the
court
has
never
said
that
there
isn't
a
right...
there
is
a
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
without
having
a
critical
stage.
in
fact,
i
believe
justice
brennan...
if
you
will
allow
me
15
seconds...
justice
brennan's
decision
in
maine
v.
moulton
said:
"recognizing
that
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
is
shaped
by
the
need
for
the
assistance
of
counsel,
we
have
found
that
the
right
attaches
at
earlier
critical
stages
in
the
criminal
justice
process
where
the
results
might
well
settle
the
accused's
fate
and
reduce
the
trial,
itself,
to
a
mere
formality.
"
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
once...
once
a
case
gets
going,
i
don't
believe
this
court
has
ever
been
presented
with
a
case
where
there
has
been
attachment,
there
have
been
some
critical
stages,
and
then
the
state
has
decided
to
deny
access.
and
we
don't
think
that
the
court
would
like--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that
is
the
usual
course
of
things.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
in
texas,
because
the
fair
defense
act
permits
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
those
who
are
held
in
custody,
all
persons
who
request
counsel
are
appointed
counsel
within
one
business
day
in
the
large
counties
and
within
one...
within
three
business
days
in
the
smaller
counties.
and
so
that--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no.
section
1.051(j)
authorized
the
counties
who
went...
to
not
appoint
counsel
when
an
individual
is
released
on
bail,
and
to
await...
to
await
the
first
critical
stage
or
the
initiation
of
adversary
judicial
proceedings;
whichever
occurs
first,
it
says.
and
so
once
this
gentleman
was
indicted,
that
would
disappear;
and
he
would
be
entitled
to
counsel,
as
he
was
appointed
counsel
immediately
upon
indictment.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
texas
statute
authorizes
appointment.
gillespie
county
is
a
smaller
county,
so
it's
three
business
days,
your
honor.
upon--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
because
mr.
rothgery
was
released
on
bail,
and
so
the
county
was
authorized
not
to
appoint
counsel.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
"examining
trial".
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
right.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
once...
once
an
examining
trial
is
scheduled,
i'm
not
sure
there
are
one
or
two
days,
but
requests...
i
think
that's
what
would
have
happened.
the
constitution
requires
appointment
of
counsel
for
an
examining
trial
a
reasonable
time
before
the
examining
trial
to
allow
for
preparation.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no.
the
examining
trial,
itself--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--this
court
in
coleman
said
that
the
examining
trial,
because
of
the
potential
harm
to
a
fair
trial
in
the
future,
would
define
it
as
a--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--an
examining
trial
is
an
extended
version
of
a
probable-cause
determination.
it
is
not
holding
on
a
charge--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--probable
cause
that...
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
if...
if
that
were
the
law,
gerstein
would
have
to
be
reversed.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that
is
what
preliminary
hearings
and
examining
trials
have
always
been
about.
yes,
your
honor.
