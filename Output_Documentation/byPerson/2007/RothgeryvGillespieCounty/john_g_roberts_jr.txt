chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
case
07-440,
rothgery
v.
gillespie
county,
texas.
ms.
spinelli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
how
can
this...
how
can
this
be
part
of
an
adversary
proceeding
when
there's
no
other
adversary
on
the
field?
the
prosecution's
not
present.
they
don't
even
know
anything
about
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
jackson
of
course
the
charges
had
already
been
filed
by
the
prosecutor,
so
there
was
an
adversary
on
the
field.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose...
i
suppose
you
could
you
have
an
adversarial
proceeding
without
the
prosecutor
present,
but
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
proceeding.
and
here
the
magistrate
simply
advises
the
individual
of
the
charges
against
him,
repeats
the
miranda
warnings,
advises
him
that
he
can
have
counsel
if
bail
is
denied
or
if
he
can't
make
bail.
what
about
that
is
adversarial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
i'll
get
back
to
the
point
i
raised
earlier,
that
in
jackson
charges
had
already
been
filed
by
a
prosecutor.
the
prosecutor
was
aware
of
this
proceeding.
i
think
that's
a
fairly
significant
distinction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
two
are
kind
of
related.
if
in
fact
there's
not
a
right
to
counsel
upon
the
magistration,
but,
as
you
said
earlier
to
justice
alito,
it
attaches
at
the
end
of
the
magistration,
it
seems
to
me
like
you're
asking
for
counsel
to
be
an
investigator
rather
than
to
participate
in
the
trial
proceedings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
not,
if
they
initiate
charges
against
them?
you're
saying,
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
you're
charged
with,
for
example,
trespassing
or
conducting
a
demonstration
on
the
court
grounds,
and
that's
a
crime.
you're
charged
with
that,
but
we
are
not
going
to
hold
you,
so,
you
know,
come
back
in
a
month.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
he
said
no,
i
don't
want
an
examining
trial.
as
soon
as
he
says
that,
then
he
can't
have
one,
and
you're
saying
he
should
have
had
a
lawyer
before
he
said
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
could
do
it;
anyone
else
could
do
it.
and
you
would
say,
once
he
does
that,
he's
made
it
into
a
critical
proceeding,
and
so
you
have
to
have
counsel
before
he
gives
up
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then...
but
then
you
are
saying
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
at
the
magistration,
because
that's
when
the
magistrate
says:
look,
you
have
an
examining
trial
coming
up,
and
you
can
waive
your
right
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
he
say
about
the
examining--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
does
he
say
about
an
examining--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
not
exactly
these
facts,
because
in
jackson
the
prosecutor
had
already
filed
charges.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
prosecutor
wasn't
involved
here.
the
prosecutor
was
involved
in
jackson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
coleman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
would
be
a
violation
of
some
liberty
interest
beside
the
sixth
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
the
answer...
your
answer
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
concerned
with
the
fair
trial,
not
the
detention
of
individuals,
and
he
has
other
constitutional
rights
that
would
be
implicated,
but
his
right
to
a
fair
trial
is
not
one
of
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
couldn't
he
point
out...
i
mean,
if
this
is
a
probable
cause
determination
and
he
knows
a
particular
fact,
couldn't
he
say,
well,
magistrate,
you
should
know
this,
and
the
magistrate
would
say,
well,
i
didn't
know
that,
so
there's
no
probable
cause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
spinelli,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
texas
would
be
better
off
if
they
didn't
have
a
magistration
proceeding
at
all,
if
they
didn't
have
a
proceeding
to
alert
the
individual
of
the
charges
against
him;
they
did
not
have
a
proceeding
to
read
him
his
rights;
they
did
not
have
a
determination
of
probable
cause.
they
would
be
better
off
if
they
didn't
do
any
of
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what's
in
it
for
the
state
to
provide
this
additional
layer?
because,
of
course,
the
person
gets
miranda
warnings
when
he
is
arrested.
and
so
why...
why
should
the
state
do
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
take
an
extra
minute?
we
have
eaten
up
your
rebuttal
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case,
07-440,
rothgery
versus
gillespie
county,
texas.
