justice
samuel

alito,

if
congress
made
a
finding
that
crack
and
cocaine
are
equally
dangerous
and
passed
a
statute
that
said,
for
sentencing
purposes,
every
district
judge
shall
treat
cases
involving
these
two
substances
exactly
the
same,
would
there
be
a
sixth
amendment
problem
with
that?
or
do
you
think
every
district
judge
gets
the
right
to
make
that
policy
decision
individually?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
fourth
circuit
sees
a
number
of
absolutely
identical
cases
exactly
like
mr.
kimbrough's,
and
it
is
apparent
in
one,
the
sentencing
judge
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
has
used
a
1
to
1,
and
the
next
one
used
20
to
1,
the
next
one
has
used
50
to
1,
the
next
one
has
used
80
to
1,
and
the
next
one
has
used
100
to
1,
what
is
it
to
do
under
reasonableness
review?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
cases
are
absolutely
identical.
everything
is
absolutely
identical
about
them,
except
for
the
sentences.
can't
introduce
any
new
variables.
what
is
the
court
of
appeals
to
do?
this
is
not
a
hypothetical
situation,
really.
this
is
what
courts
of
appeals
who
have
to
see
dozens
of
these
cases
have
to
do.
there's
a
policy
question
there.
how
severely
should
crack
be
treated?
what
is
the
substantive
review
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
provide
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
your
answer
is
that
all
or
most
of
those
cases
would
be
affirmed
under
reasonableness...
under
abuse
of
discretion
review?
