justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that
was
wrong.
maybe
the
sentencing
commission
should
have,
in
order
to
be
faithful
to
the
congressional
determination,
should
have
done
it
quite
proportionately.
i
mean,
i'm
not
hung
up
on
what
the
sentencing
commission
said.
i'm
hung
up
on
what
the
courts
should
do
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
it
may
be
quite
impossible
to
achieve
uniformity
through
advisory
guidelines,
which
is
why
congress
made
them
mandatory.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
say...
you
don't
say
anything
goes.
i
mean,
the
hypothetical
that
justice
alito
gave
is...
is
easy,
only
because
congress
has
created
the
100
to
1
ratio
as
presumably
reasonable.
if
congress
enacted
it
as
a
statute,
it
has
to
be
reasonable.
so
that
enables
you
to
say
anything
from
1
to
1
to
100
to
1
is
reasonable.
but
your
position
is
not
anything
goes.
it's
anything
that's
reasonable
goes.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
because
congress
has
said
100
to
1.
that
strikes
me
as
utterly
unreasonable.
but
if
congress
has
said
it,
it
can't
be
unreasonable.
that's
what
makes
that
an
easy
hypothetical,
but
that
would
not
be
the
normal
case,
that
a
100
to
1
disparity
wouldn't
be...
would
not
be
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
why...
and
the
1993
statute
that
you
said,
that
you
referred
to,
did
indeed
require
the
guidelines
to
track
the...
the
statutory
prescriptions
for
sentencing.
justice
antonin
scalia
pardon
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
2003.
sorry.
i
misspoke.
but...
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
guidelines
are
only
guidelines
and
that
still
doesn't...
doesn't
convert
to
an
obligation
for
the
district
courts
to
follow
that
scheme
so
long
as
that
scheme
is
only
reflected
in
the
guidelines.
the
guidelines
themselves
are
still
just
advisory.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
don't
you
just
skip
the
guidelines
and
say
that
the
effect
of
the
sentencing
statute
is
to
make
it
unreasonable
for
a
sentencing
judge...
never
mind
the
guidelines...
to
do
anything
other
than
follow
the
100
to
1
prescription
that
congress
has
established?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
the
guidelines
add
to...
to
your
game
except
another...
another
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
would
say
that
that
statute
reflects
congress's
desire
that
sentencing,
whether
it's
through
the
commission
or
not,
be
based
on
the
100
to
1
ratio.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
the
gap
in
your
argument
is
that
whatever
congress
legislated,
it
did
not
legislate
the
manner
in
which
you
transferred
this
100
to
1
ratio
onto
the
sentencing
chart.
and
as
your
opponent
points
out,
it
isn't
done
proportionally.
it
could
have
been
done
in
a
lot
of
different
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe.
but
there
are
other
logically
proportional
manners
of
doing
it.
why
would
the
district
court
be
bound
to
the
particular
one
that
the
sentencing
commission
chose?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
i'm
granting
that
they
got
a
start
where
congress
did.
i'm
assuming
that.
but
why
do
they
have
to
follow
it
through
the
way
the
sentencing
guidelines
did?
