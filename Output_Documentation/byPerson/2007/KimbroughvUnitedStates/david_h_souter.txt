justice
david
h.
souter
what's
your
answer
simply
to
the
very
simple
argument
that
because
the
floor
was
set
on
the
assumption
of
a
100
to
1
ratio,
set
by
congress,
that
any
other
sentencing
assumption,
regardless
of
the
particular
justifications
in
a
given
case,
is
simply
incoherent
with
the
statutory
scheme
and
for
that
reason
should
be
regarded
as
unreasonable?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
the
coherence
problem
that
is
bothering
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
that
an
argument
for
saying,
well,
in
the
lsd
case,
you
approved
of
incoherence
and
irrationality,
therefore,
you
want
to
do
it
across
the
board?
i
mean,
there
is
still
an
argument
here
on
the
merits
regardless
of
neal
that
there
is
an
incoherence
between
the
minimum
and
the
kind
of
discretion
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
we
have
the
cliff
problem
in
the
lsd
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
we
are
in
the
same
boat,
then,
you
say
with
neal
in
that
respect,
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
just
goes
back
to
justice
scalia's
point.
there
may
very
well
be
an
implicit
congressional
directive
that
the
commission
did
not
follow.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
did
not
reject
them,
you
are
saying?
so,
therefore,
in
effect,
there
was
a
congressional
ratification?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
were
representing
the
one
who
got
the
80
to
1
ratio
you
would
file
an
amicus
brief,
no
error
in
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
your
answer
also
to
justice
breyer's
question
the
post-neal
amendment
to
the
statute
which
in
effect
says,
you
know,
make
your
guidelines
consistent
with
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
quite...
quite
apart
from
the
specific
rejection
of
the
proposal
they
came
up
with.
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
has
legislated
in
this
area
after
booker.
they
have
not
imposed
the
100
to
1
ratio
throughout
the...
other
than
as
a
mandatory
minimum
and
maximum.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that,
as
you
say,
in
effect,
makes
a
certain
element
mandatory.
and
why
doesn't
that
come
up
against
the
same
sixth
amendment
judgement
that
we
made
in
booker?
