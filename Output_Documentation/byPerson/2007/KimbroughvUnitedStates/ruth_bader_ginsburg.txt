justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
nachmanoff,
in
the
absence
of
anything
further
from
congress,
and
accepting
your
argument
that
there's
no...
that
the
guidelines
did
not
have
to
adopt
the
ratio
that
is
applicable
to
the
mandatory
minimum,
could
a
district
judge
then
say,
i
see
that
this
disparity
is
untenable,
but
i
think
drugs
are
a
very
bad
thing,
so
i'm
going
to
sentence
for
powder
as
high
as
for
crack?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we
throw
out
the
100
to
1,
what
is
the
range
open
to
the
district
judge...
hundred
to
one
is
okay,
but
i
have
to
use
the...
i'm
going
to
use
the
crack
for
both?
or
say
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two,
so
i'm
going
to
set
it
at
20
to
1
and
another
judge
5
to
1.
what
is...
are
all
those
reasonable
within
the
position
that
you
take
in
this
case?
would
all
those
have
to
pass
muster
at
the
court
of
appeals
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
mr.
nachmanoff,
i
think
that
you
are
agreeing,
although
you
don't
want
to
come
right
out
and
say
it,
with
justice
scalia's
point;
that
is,
anything
from
a
hundred
to
one
down
to
one
to
one
is
open
to
the
district
judge;
and
within
that
range,
there
is
no
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
case,
your
answer
is
anything
from
what
congress
has
said,
down
to
one
to
one,
would
be
a
reasonable
sentence
that
would
be...
that
would
pass
muster
on
appeal
because
it
is
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you've
given
me
a
bunch
of
hand
holds
that,
quite
frankly,
are
quite
easy
for
a
district
judge
to
say:
here's
my
laundry
list;
and
i'm
going
to
go
through
every
one
of
them;
but
in
the
end
i
think
the
ratio
should
be
20
to
1;
and
that's
what
i'm
going
to
impose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
congress
not
having
done
that,
then
the
range
is
open
to
the
district
judges,
100
to
1
to
1
to
1.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
are
you
saying
that
either
the
guidelines
are
out
of
it
and
the
statute
controls,
the
ratio
is
a
100
to
1,
or
that
congress
has,
in
effect,
made
a
particular
guideline,
the
one
setting
the
drug
quantity,
made
that
mandatory?
that
guideline...
i
mean,
it
sounds
to
me
that
if
you
must
adhere
to
the
100
to
1,
then
that's
a
mandatory
guideline.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
prescribing
sentences
for
cocaine
trafficking
offenses,
the
u.s.
sentencing
guidelines
set
100-to-1
powder/crack
ratio.
thus,
a
dealer
in
crack
cocaine
was
subject
to
the
same
sentence
range
as
a
dealer
in
a
100
times
more
powder
cocaine.
our
2005
decision
in
booker
v.
united
states
rendered
the
once
mandatory
guidelines
effectively
advisory
and
adopted
a
reasonableness
standard
for
appellate
review
of
district
court
sentences.
we
decide
today
whether
that
appellate
review
standard
can
be
met
when
a
district
judge
imposes
a
sentence
reflecting
her
disagreement
with
the
100-to-1
powder/crack
ratio
as
implemented
in
the
guidelines.
derrick
kimbrough,
defendant
below,
petitioner
here,
pleaded
guilty
to
trafficking
in
crack
cocaine
based
on
the
100-to-1,
the
guidelines
called
for
a
sentence
between
228
and
270
months.
the
district
court
however
determined
that
a
sentence
within
that
range
would
be
greater
than
necessary
to
accomplish
the
basic
objectives
of
sentencing
congress
stated
in
18
u.s.c.
3553(a).
the
statutory
minimum
sentence
of
180
months,
the
district
court
concluded,
sufficed
to
satisfy
the
sentencing
objectives
congress
specified.
on
the
government's
appeal,
the
fourth
circuit
reversed.
a
sentence
outside
the
guidelines
range
is
per
se
unreasonable,
the
court
of
appeals
held
when
it
is
based
as
kimbrough
sentence
in
part
was
on
the
district
court’s
disagreement
with
the
sentencing
disparity
for
crack
and
powder
cocaine
offenses.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
under
booker,
all
guidelines
are
advisory
only.
the
fourth
circuit
erred
in
treating
the
cocaine
guidelines
as
effectively
mandatory.
the
crack/powder
disparity
originated
in
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1986
which
imposed
minimum
sentences
for
drug
trafficking
crimes.
congress
apparently
believed
that
crack
cocaine
was
significantly
more
dangerous
than
powder
cocaine
and
thus
treated
every
gram
of
crack
as
equivalent
of
100
grams
of
powder.
in
setting
guidelines
ranges
for
cocaine
offenses,
the
sentencing
commission
did
not
follow
its
usual
empirical
approach.
instead,
it
simply
used
the
statutory
100-to-1
ratio.
later
research
and
experience
however
led
the
commission
to
report
that
a
crack/powder
disparity
so
large,
rests
on
erroneous
assumptions
about
the
relative
dangerousness
of
the
two
forms
of
the
drug.
the
government
primarily
contends
that
the
guidelines
implementing
the
100-to-1
ratio
are
an
exception
to
the
post
booker
advisory
only
character
of
the
guidelines.
congress’
use
of
the
100-to-1
ratio
in
the
1986
act,
the
government
urges,
effectively
bars
sentencing
courts
from
failing
to
adhere
in
all
respects
to
that
ratio.
we
disagree.
as
explained
in
today's
opinion,
the
1986
act
mandates
only
maximum
and
minimum
sentences.
it
says
nothing
about
appropriate
sentences
within
those
statutory
ranges.
the
district
judge
in
this
case
determined
that
the
statutory
minimum
of
15
years,
not
the
guidelines
bottom
of
19-and-a-half
years
was
the
appropriate
prison
term
for
kimbrough.
in
so
ruling,
the
district
court
both
homed
in
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
kimbrough's
case
and
accorded
weight
to
the
sentencing
commission's
reports
showing
that
the
crack/powder
disparity
yields
unjustifiably
harsh
sentences
for
crack
offenders.
giving
due
respect
to
the
district
court's
reasoned
appraisal
of
reviewing
court
could
not
rationally
conclude
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
impose
in
this
case
a
sentence
four
and
a
half
years
below
the
bottom
sentence
indicated
by
the
guidelines.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justices
thomas
and
alito
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
