could
the
congress
have
mandated
the
result
and
the
rationale
that
the
fourth
circuit
used
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
"reasonable"
defined
as
an
appropriate
interpretation
of
congressional
intent,
or
does
"reasonable"
mean
something
else,
like
a
just
sentence?
what...
how
do
we
define
"reasonable"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whether
or
not
the
commission
and
then
the
district
judge
reasonably
interpret
the
congressional
intent,
and
if
the
commission
reasonably
interprets
the
congressional
intent
is
the
district
court
allowed
to
disregard
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assuming
the
commission
was
reasonable,
can
they
still
disagree?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
your
case
you
ask
us
to
establish
the
proposition
that
in
any
case,
a
sentencing
judge
must
always
be
free
to
disregard
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
commission,
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
a
congressional
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
go
further...
you
would
go
further
and...
and
submit
to
us
the
proposition
that
i...
that
i
just
stated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
reasonably.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
and
i
take
it
your
submission
is
that
the
district
court
must
be
able
to
make
the
determination
that
the
commission's
policy
is
to
be
disregarded
in
every
case
to
come
before
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
guidelines
supersede
the
parsimony
provision,
because
the
parsimony
provision
is
general
and
the
guidelines...
the
ratio
is
specific?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
experience
shows
that
the
ratio
is
not
consistent
with
the
parsimony
provision...
we
find
that
over
a
course
of
time?
