mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
derrick
kimbrough's
case
is
about
what
a
district
court
may
consider
when
imposing
sentence
in
conformity
with
section
3553(a).
that
statute
directs
sentencing
courts
to
do
exactly
what
judge
jackson
did
in
this
case.
he
properly
calculated
and
considered
the
advisory
guideline
range,
the
sentencing
commission's
reports,
mr.
kimbrough's
personal
history
and
background,
and
the
offense
itself,
as
directed
by
the
statute.
he
then
made
case-specific
findings
to
impose
an
appropriate
sentence,
and
he
did
not
make
any
categorical
determinations.
the
fourth
circuit
reversed,
applying
a
per
se
rule
prohibiting
disagreement
with
the
crack
cocaine
guideline.
the
government,
on
the
other
hand,
argues
that
congress
has
implicitly
directed
sentencing
courts
to
adhere
to
the
crack
guidelines.
both
of
these
positions
are
wrong.
with
respect
to
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit
applied
a
rigid
rule
that
prohibited
any
disagreement
with
the
crack
guideline,
which
is
determined
solely
by
drug
type
and
quantity.
they
then
prohibited
the
imposition
of
any
sentence
outside
the
guideline
range,
either
above
it
or
below
it,
unless
the
court
identified
facts
specific
to
the
defendant
or
the
offense.
this
ruling
is
inconsistent
with
the
court's
holdings
in
cunningham
and
rita,
which
hold
that
the
courts
must
be
free
to
disagree
with
policies.
finally,
the
fourth
circuit
required
that
those
facts
be
atypical,
which
mirrors
the
exact
language
that
was
excised
in
3553(b)(1).
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
your
honor,
congress
can
certainly
speak
explicitly
through
its
statutes
to
impose
further
refinements
on
the
penalty
structure
that
it
set
out
in
841.
section
841,
on
its
face,
does
no
more
than
set
mandatory
minimums
and
maximums
at
two
triggering
quantities.
if
congress
wanted
to
specify
further
triggering
quantities
which
would
cabin
the
discretion
of
sentencing
courts,
they
could
do
so,
but
they
have
not
done
so
and
there
is
no
canon
of
statutory
construction
that
the
government
identifies
or
that
i'm
aware
of
that
would
justify
the
notion
of
the
implicit
binding
directive.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
justice
alito,
congress
certainly
can
cabin
the
discretion
of
judges.
but
once
they
set
a
floor
and
a
ceiling,
pursuant
to
this
court's
remedial
holding
in
booker,
judges
must
be
free
to
consider
the
entire
range
of
punishment.
and
booker
relies
on
the
notion
that
the
guidelines
are
now
fully
advisory
and,
therefore,
judges
without
having
to
identify
specific
facts
have
to
have
the
discretion
to
disagree
with
policies
or
identify
things
unique
to
the
case
in
order
to
fashion
an
appropriate
punishment.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
yes.
there
are
several
answers
to
that
question,
justice
souter.
the
first
is
that
this
court
has
recognized
with
the
same
statute
which
has
the
same
structure
that
the
government
argues
can
only
logically
be
understood
one
way,
that
with
regard
to
the
weight
for
lsd
in
the
case
of
neal
versus
united
states,
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
there
to
be
two
different
methods
of
calculating
weight
for
purposes
of
punishment.
the
guidelines
calculate
weight
based
on
a
presumed
weight
of
the
combination
of
the
lsd
and
the
blotter
paper
or
the
carrier
medium.
and
the
statute
defines
the
method
for
calculating
the
mandatory
minimum
by
the
combined
weight
of
the
lsd
and
the
blotter
paper,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
heavy
or
whether
it
is
light.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
neal
reflects
is
that
there's
no
implicit
binding
policy
directive
in
841
itself
that
requires
either
the
commission
or
sentencing
courts
to
follow
in
lock
step
on
a
graduated
proportionate
scheme,
whatever
it
is
that
congress
decided
with
respect
to
two
specific
triggers
should
be
the
case.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
recognized
that,
in
fact,
cliffs
are
the
inevitable
results
of
mandatory
minimums.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
yes,
and
your
honor,
if
i
could
also
point
out
that
there
really
is
a
myth
here
with
regard
to
the
100
to
1
ratio
as
it
stands
now
and
as
the
commission
created
it
in
1987.
the
100
to
1
ratio
describes
the
relative
weight
of
crack
cocaine
and
powder
cocaine
with
regard
to
the
levels
in
the
sentencing
table;
so
that
if
you
compare,
for
example,
the
10-year
mandatory
minimum
trigger,
50
grams
of
crack,
that
gets
you
to
a
level
32
in
the
sentencing
table
and
it
requires
5
kilos
of
powder
cocaine
or
5,000
grams.
that's
the
100
to
1
ratio.
and
it
is
true
that
if
one
compares
the
low
end
of
that
table...
5
kilos
to
50
grams,
you
end
up
with
the
same
punishment,
or
likewise,
if
you
compare
the
top
of
the
range,
15
kilos
to
a
150
grams.
but
the
way
the
guidelines
have
been
written,
there
are
a
multitude
of
ratios
that
get
applied
right
now
and
were
applied
in
the
pre-booker
guidelines
scheme.
in
other
words,
14.9
kilos
of
powder
compared
to
51
grams
of
crack
results
in
a
292
to
1
ratio.
you
get
the
exact
same
punishment,
it
is
a
level
32.
likewise
if
you
flip
it,
and
you
compare
149
grams
of
crack
to
5
kilos
of
powder
cocaine,
you
are
still
within
a
level
32,
and
it
is
a
34
to
1
ratio.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
and
of
course,
the
sentencing
commission
taken
to
the
ultimate
extreme
would
have
had
to
have
a
proportionate
sentencing
table
by
gram
or
fraction
of
a
gram
in
order
to
preserve
the
100
to
1
ratio,
which
simply
points
out
in
combination
with
neal
the
fact
that
this
was
a
choice
made
by
the
commission,
a
choice,
by
the
way,
not
grounded
on
any
empirical
evidence
or
any
other
reason
other
than
what
841
originally
indicated.
it
could
have
been
done
differently.
it
is
done
differently
with
regard
to
other
drugs
in
841,
such
as
lsd
or
such
as
marijuana
plants,
which
have
a
different
method
for
calculation
under
the
guidelines
as
they
do
for
purposes
of
mandatory
minimums.
and,
of
course,
what
that
means
is
that
there
is
no
implicit
directive,
which
is
the
only
rational--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--well...
your
honor,
congress
has
a
method--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--well,
congress
did
not
reject
the
original
table
that
was
created
by
the
commission
in
1987.
that
is
correct.
but
congress
also
did
not
at
any
time
in
section
994,
which
is
where
it
has
given
other
explicit
directions
to
the
commission
to
fashion
guidelines
in
a
particular
way,
say
anything
about
how
to
fashion
the
punishment
for
crack
cocaine
or
any
of
the
other
drugs
in
section
841.
so
congress
understands
if
it
wants
to
give
further
guidance
to
the
commission
how
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
justice
ginsburg,
our
rule
certainly
contemplates
the
fact
that
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
district
judges
may
come
to
conclusions
about
the
appropriate
sentence,
taking
into
consideration
the
purposes
of
sentencing
and
the
parsimony
provision--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--well
those
certainly
are
positions
that
judges
could
take.
in
this
particular
case,
the
judge
was
presented
with
information
that
led
the
court
to
conclude
that
reducing
the
sentence
for
crack
based
on
the
commission's
overwhelming
empirical
evidence
and
penological
evidence
and
the
statistical
evidence
that
was
submitted
was
relevant
to
the
various
factors
in
3553(a),
in
particular
the
purposes
of
sentencing.
and
that
the
guidelines
would
not
be
appropriate
and,
therefore,
a
lower
sentence
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
given
explicit
instruction
by
this
court
that
it
is
to
review
all
of
those
sentences
under
an
abuse
of
discretion,
which
means
that
its
job
is
not
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
lower
court.
and
if
those
sentencing
courts
have
articulated
reasons
and
have
relied
on
relevant
and
reliable--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--justice
alito,
sentencing
courts
now
are
free
to
consider
the
full
range
of
punishment
and
to
consider
the
purposes
of
sentencing
in
both
issue-specific
to
the
defendant
and
the
offense
and
also
general
policy
issues.
that
is
the
clear
holding
of
the
booker
remedial
opinion
and
reaffirmed
in
cunningham
and
in
rita.
when
judges
have
that
full
discretion
to
consider
the
guidelines
and
follow
the
mandates
of
3553(a),
but
then
impose
a
sentence
that
meets
the
purposes
of
sentencing
and
is
consistent
with
the
parsimony
provision,
there
may
well
be
judges
that
come
to
different
conclusions,
as
your
hypothetical
posits,
about
what
people
with
similar
or
even
identical
records
and
identical
circumstances
may...
may
do.
i
would
say
that
the
reality
is
in
the
lower
courts
no
two
cases
are
alike,
and
so
there
are
always
reasons
for
judges
to
make
reasoned
distinctions
in
imposing
sentences,
even
where,
for
example,
the
drug
type
and
quantity
is
identical.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
if...
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
well,
justice
souter,
if
the
court
followed
the
procedural
requirements
of
3553(a),
if
the
information
was
subjected
to
the
adversarial
process,
and
if
the
court
imposed
a
sentence
consistent
with
the
parsimony
clause,
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
basis
upon
which
to
object.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
justice
breyer,
the
booker
remedial
opinion
makes
it
crystal-clear
that
to
avoid
the
sixth
amendment
problem
with
the
mandatory
guidelines,
judges
must
be
free
to
disagree
with
the
guidelines.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
your
honor,
3553(a)
is
driven
by
the
purposes
of
sentencing.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
well,
your
honor,
the
appellate
courts
still
have
a
role
to
play
and
that
role
is
to
ensure
that
the
sentencing
courts
have
followed
the
mandate
of
3553(a),
and
that--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--that
very
well
may
be,
justice
scalia.
in...
this
court
even
in
the
remedial
opinion
in
booker
recognized
that
uniformity
as
it
was
understood
in
the
pre-booker
days
would
be
reduced,
and
that
there
might
be
more
sentences
that
have
different
results--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--well,
justice
breyer,
your
question
certainly
is
a
difficult
one.
let
me
say
this:
with
regard
to
uniformity,
congress
has
the
power
to
make
sentences
more
uniform.
they
can
do
it
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
they
have
done
it
where
they've
thought
it
was
important.
they
haven't
done
it
with
regard
to
the
100
to
1
ratio
beyond
the
mandatory
minimum
or
the
statutory
maximum.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
and--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--sentencing
courts
must
be
able
to
disagree
with
the
commission's
conclusions
about
congressional
intent.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
the
essence
of
the
booker
remedial
holding,
that
in
order
to
cure
the
constitutional
problem
with
mandatory
guidelines,
judges
must
be
free
to
reject,
must
be
free
to
reject
those
guidelines.
and
in
fact
cunningham
makes
that
clear,
that
in
the
california
determinate
sentencing
area
it
was
the
inability
of
judges
to
impose
a
higher
sentence
based
on
the
general
objectives
of
sentencing,
as
opposed
to
particular
factors
or
circumstances
in
aggravation,
that
made
it
unconstitutional.
so
whether
the
commission
concluded
that
the
congressional
intent
was
to
import
the
100
to
1
ratio
or
not...
and
clearly
there
is
no
statutory
construction
that
can
be
inferred
or
understood
from
841
by
itself.
it
is
not
explicit
and
the
government
concedes
that.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
that's...
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
well,
your
honor,
if...
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
when
the
commission
concludes
this
is
what
congress
intended--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--reasonably...
does
it
somehow
imbue
that
particular
guideline
with
some
special
binding
nature.
and
my
response
would
be
that
the
booker
remedial
opinion
makes
it
clear
that
the
guidelines
as
a
whole
must
be
viewed
as
advisory.
the
government
tries
to
argue
that
if
some
guidelines
are
special
and
are
binding,
and
others
are
advisory,
there's
no
sixth
amendment
problem.
but
that
ignores
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
booker
remedial
hearing...
holding,
which
is
that
the
guidelines
as
a
whole
must
be
advisory
and
judges
must
be
able
to
disagree
with
them.
and
of
course
here
is
perhaps
the
paradigmatic
example
of
a
time
when
the
commission's
original
guidelines
got
it
wrong,
didn't
further
the
purposes
of
sentencing;
and,
of
course,
they
themselves
have
made
that
conclusion,
and
for
sentencing
purposes--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--well,
your
honor,
3553(a)
requires
individualized
sentencing.
there's
no
question
that
judges
are
required
to
follow
in
every
case
the
mandates
of
3553(a)
and
to
calculate
the
advisory
guidelines
correctly.
now,
there
is
no
reason
why
judges
cannot
in
a
certain
class
of
cases
conclude
that
the
guideline
gets
it
wrong;
that
it
overstates
the
seriousness
of
the
offense;
that
it
creates
an
unwarranted
disparity;
and
that
they
are
going
to
impose
a
sentence
outside
of
that
guideline
range.
that
does
not
in
any
way
remove
the
requirement
that
they
subject
every
sentencing
to
the
adversarial
process
to
give
the
parties
the
opportunity
to
convince
them
that
the
guidelines
should
be
followed,
or
not
followed,
or
to
be
reconsidered.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
your
honor,
i
certainly
agree
that
that
full
range
is
available
to
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
well,
if
i
can
be
clear,
justice
ginsburg,
sentencing
courts
must
have
available
to
them
the
full
range
of
punishment
as
defined
by
congress.
and
that
range,
for
purposes
of
841,
are
broad
ranges
based
on
triggering
quantities
at
5
grams
and
50
grams
for
crack
cocaine.
within
those
ranges,
as
long
as
the
court
follows
the
requirements
of
3553(a),
considers
all
the
purposes
of
sentencing,
engages
in
an
individualized
sentencing
process,
and
relies
on
relevant
and
reliable
information,
there
would
be
no
basis
under
abuse
of
discretion
review
to
reverse
the
sentencing
court
in
that
instance.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
well,
again,
your
honor,
congress
certainly
has
the
power
to
cabin
that
discretion.
they
just
need
to
do
it
explicitly,
and
they
have
not
done
so.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
if
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
can
respond,
justice
stevens,
i
think...
you
asked
about
the
percentage
of
cases
in
crack
that
are
at
the
mandatory
minimum
or
near
it.
i
would
point
the
court
to
page
33,
footnote
10
of
our
opening
brief.
it
is
approximately
70
percent
or
just
over
that
that
hit
at
the
mandatory
minimum
or
just
one
or
two
levels
above
that.
so
the
large
majority
of
cases
involving
crack
cocaine
end
up
being
subjected
to
the
mandatory
minimum.
with
regard
to
the
government's
argument
regarding
section
994(a)
and
the
fact
that
direction
was
given
to
the
commission
to
be
consistent
with
pertinent
statutes,
of
course,
that's
reflected
in
section
5(g)
which
says
that
mandatory
minimums
trump
the
guidelines,
and
the
commission
recognizes
that
and
of
course
sentencing
judges
recognize
that,
and
judge
jackson
recognized
it
here.
to
suggest
that
judge
jackson
concluded
that
congress
was
crazy,
i
think
is
unfair.
what
judge
jackson
did
was,
in
a
very
reasoned
opinion,
explained
that
the
information
from
the
sentencing
commission,
which
has
been
persuasive
not
just
to
judge
jackson,
but
to
judges
across
the
country
and
to
many
others,
was
that
the
100
to
1
ratio
overstates
the
seriousness
of
the
offense,
and
he
understood
that
congress
had
spoken
clearly
with
regard
to
mandatory
minimums,
and
he
honored
them.
finally,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
point
out
the
heart
of
the
problem
with
the
government's
case.
congress
has
not
spoken
explicitly
in
the
way
the
government
suggests.
they
are--
mr.
michael
s.
nachmanoff
--well,
your
honor,
congress
has
failed
completely
to
address
this
particular
problem,
and
they
have
understood
since
booker
that
if
they
wanted
to
address
the
issue
of
the
discretion
that
sentencing
courts
must
have
with
regard
to
the
advisory
guidelines,
they
have
a
way
of
fixing
the
problem.
they
can
change
the
statute.
and
so
long
as
they
then
require
the
government
to
include
in
the
indictment
and
prove
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
specific
drug
type
and
drug
quantity
over
and
above
the
current
mandatory
minimum
and
maximums,
they're
free
to
do
that,
and
there
would
no
sixth
amendment
problem
and
there
would
no
problem
with
the
advisory
guidelines.
in
other
words,
right
now,
the
government
simply
alleges
that
a
person
engaged
in
the
distribution
of
either
5
grams
or
50
grams
of
crack
cocaine...
that's
what
they
have
to
do
to
meet
the
thresholds
for
the
5-year
and
the
10-year
mandatory
minimums...
in
virtually
every
case
the
government
will
present
evidence
or
a
court
will
find
under
relevant
conduct
that
there
was
some
greater
quantity.
and
if
the
government's
theory
were
to
be
accepted,
those
guidelines
would
be
mandatory,
and
it
would
be
in
direct
conflict
with
the
remedial
holding
in
booker
to
require
courts
to
adhere
to
that,
absent
the
procedural
protections
which
are
not
currently
in
place.
judge
jackson
did
it
right
in
this
case.
he
imposed
a
sentence
consistent
with
the
parsimony
provision
and
the
purposes
of
sentencing
and
all
of
the
factors
in
3553(a).
he
imposed
a
long
sentence,
15
years,
but
he
honored
congress's
explicit
mandate,
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
affirm
the
district
court.
thank
you.
