may
i
interrupt
before
you
answer.
the
question
isn't
whether
they
can
justify
a
reasonable.
it's
whether
they
can
justify
not
following
one
that
creates
unwarranted
disparities
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
can
i
ask
a
question
right
at
the
outset
that
is
critical
for
me.
i
think
this
case
may
well
be
controlled
by
the
decision
in
neal
against
the
united
states,
which
is
not
cited
in
the
government
brief
and
wasn't
cited
in
the
blue
brief.
but
there
the
court
held
that
a
policy
judgment
by
congress
fixing
mandatory
minimums
on
the
basis
of
the
weight
of
the
carrier
rather
than
the
drug
did
not
justify
guidelines
based
on
that
ratio...
based
on
the
same
principle...
if
that
would
produce
unwarranted
disparities.
and,
as
i
understand
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
commission
has
told
us
actually
in
some
of
its
reports
that
the
100
to
1
ratio
does
produce
unwarranted
disparities.
therefore,
we
should
disregard
the
entire
guideline
as
we
did
in
neal,
and
the
reason
the
neal
case
is
controlling
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
a
construction
of
what
congress
intended,
and
for
purposes
of
decision
we
assumed
that
congress
intended
what
we
held
the
statute
meant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
hold
that
a
guideline
that
does
not
conform
with
a
congressional
judgment
merely
expressed
in
a
mandatory
minimum
is
a
guideline
that
would
survive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there's
also
more
data
that
the
commission
has
reflected
on
all
this
and
still
concludes
that
the
100
to
1
ratio
creates
an
unwarranted
disparity
which
is
contrary
to
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
establishes
the
ratio
for
mandatory
minimum
purposes
only,
is
what
neal
held.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
are
the
same
cliff
effects
that
are
the
product
of
neal,
precisely
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
response
to
that
statute,
did
the
commission
revise
the
guideline
that
was
involved
in
neal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
shouldn't
it
have
done
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
that
only
affects
about
20
percent
of
the
crack
cocaine
cases,
because
they
say...
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
this...
that
80
percent
of
the
sentences
are
actually
fixed
by
the
mandatory
minimum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
80
percent
of
the
sentences
that
are
actually
imposed
are
at
the
mandatory
minimum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
this
another
alternative?
if
the
district
judge
concluded,
as
some
scholars
have,
that
the
100
to
1
ratio
itself
creates
unwarranted
disparities,
could
not
a
district
judge
sentence
by
just
disregarding
the
guideline
for
this
particular
substance?
and
then
use
just
ordinary
principles,
what's
appropriate
sentencing
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
a
conflict
in
the
statute.
one
says
await
the
guideline.
another
says
avoid
unwarranted
disparities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
a
fact
that
this
guideline
is
also
unique
in
that
it
was
not
based
on
a
history
of
other
similar
crimes
like
all
the
other...
most
of
the
guidelines
were?
there's
no
expert
interpretation
of
the
history
of
sentencing
in
this
particular
area?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
this
guideline
is
pretty
much
unique
in
that
regard.
it
is
not
based
on
experience
in
sentencing
in
comparable
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
100
to
1
ratio
is
not
based
on
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore,
none
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
relating
to
crack
are
based
on
history.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
really
an
entirely
different
rationale
for
defending
these
guidelines
than
any
other
guidelines
in
the
system?
