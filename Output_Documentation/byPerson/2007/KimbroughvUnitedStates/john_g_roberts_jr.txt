chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-6330,
kimbrough
versus
united
states.
mr.
nachmanoff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
nachmanoff.
mr.
dreeben?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if...
you're
talking
about
public
law
104-38?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
also
said,
quote,
"the
sentence
imposed
for
trafficking
in
crack
cocaine
should
generally
exceed
the
sentence
for
powder
cocaine.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
fine,
but
that's
pretty
far
from
100
to
1.
"generally
exceed",
it
suggests
to
me
that
congress
itself,
in
terms...
you
are
relying
on
this
implicit
directive
from
congress.
and
that's
the
latest
expression
of
congressional
implicit
direction,
and
it
just
says
"generally
exceed".
so,
you
know,
two
to
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
you
are
relying
on
an
implicit
directive
anyway.
so
as
you
are
looking
at
that
vague
direction,
it
seems
to
me
that
their
last
expression
on
what
they
wanted
the
commission
to
do
is
more
probative
than
a
much
older
pre-existing
100
to
1
ratio.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
mr.
dreeben,
your
office
used
to
argue
that
when
congress
wants
to
do
something,
there's
a
way
to
do
it.
they
pass
a
law
through
both
houses,
then
the
president
signs
it.
that's
the
only
way
they
can
give
legal
effect
to
their
intent.
now
you
are
arguing
that
there's
some
binding
intent
simply
because
they
set
mandatory
minimums
and
mandatory
maximums
that
carry
beyond
that.
i'm
wondering
how
that's
consistent
with
the
positions
the
office
has
taken
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
should
read
a
negative
pregnant
in
the
congress'
vetoing
of
what
the
commission
wanted
to
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
doesn't
congress...
why
didn't
congress,
in
fact,
do
what
you
say
they
implicitly
did
explicitly?
they
could
impose
the
100
to
1
ratio
throughout
as
opposed
to
simply
as
a
minimum
and
a
maximum.
and
they
did
not
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
nachmanoff,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
was
wrong
that
they
legislated
after
booker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
nachmanoff.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
for
the
court
this
morning
in
case
06-6330,
kimbrough
versus
united
states.
