mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
essentially,
can
a
district
court
reasonably
disagree
with
the
judgment
of
congress
concerning
the
ratio
between
the
quantity-based
sentences
for
crack
and
powder.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens,
let
me
start
with
the
neal
decision,
because
i
think
neal
is
fundamentally
unlike
this
case.
in
neal
this
court
had
to
determine
whether
its
prior
construction
of
a
statute,
section
841,
survived
the
commission's
decision--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
stevens,
the
only
question
presented
in
neal
was,
did
the
commission's
weight
guideline
for
lsd
require
this
court
to
change
its
interpretation
of
section
841.
and
the
court
held
no.
there
was
no
question
before
the
court
about
whether
the
sentencing
commission
had
legitimately
adopted
a
different
formula
than
the
mixture
or
substance
rule
that
this
court
had
held
governed
the
statute.
the
lsd
guideline
was
not
in
play
in
neal.
the
government
never
challenged
it.
its
rationality
was
not
at
issue.
all
the
court
had
to
hold
was
that
whatever
the
sentencing
commission
did--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
stevens,
because
no
one
challenged
the
guideline
in
neal.
there
was
nothing
at
issue
in
the
court
to
decide
about
whether
that
guideline
was
valid.
but
even
if
the
court
thought
that
neal
does
involve
some
sort
of
a
principle
that
the
sentencing
commission
has
greater
freedom
to
vary
from
the
procedures
laid
out
in
a
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
statute,
neal
does
not
control
this
case,
because
there
is
more
data
about
what
congress
intended
the
ratio
between
crack
and
powder
to
be,
and
because
congress
changed
the
basic,
organic
statute
that
governs
the
sentencing
commission's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
statute,
itself,
section
841,
establishes
the
ratio
of
a
100
to
1.
when
the
commission
first
considered
creating
drug
guidelines--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
stevens,
and
i'm
trying
to
explain
why
the
legal
context
is
different
from
the
legal
context
in
neal.
let
me
start
with
a
couple
of
points
about
this.
first
of
all,
when
the
commission
promulgated
the
drug
guideline
initially,
it
conformed
it
to
the
100
to
ratio
that
existed
under
the
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
statute,
because
it
recognized...
and
these
were
the
commission's
words...
that
a
logical
and
coherent
sentencing
scheme
required
that
there
be
consistent
proportionality
throughout
the
sentencing
process.
when
the
commission
later
studied
the
crack-powder
ratio
and
concluded
that
congress
had
gotten
it
wrong
and,
therefore,
the
commission,
itself,
had
gotten
it
wrong
by
conforming
to
what
congress
did,
it
proposed
a
guideline
that
would
have
changed
the
ratio
for
guideline's
purposes
only
to
one
to
one
between
crack
and
powder.
and
congress,
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
its
review
of
guidelines
amendments,
rejected
that
proposal;
and
it
did
so
with
legislation
that
made
clear
that
it
believed
that
if
the
commission
wanted
to
come
back
with
something
new,
it
should
propose
something
that
would
change
both
the
guidelines
and
the
sentencing
statutes
so
that
they
would
continue
to
work
in
tandem...
that
it
would
preserve
a
higher
ratio
of
punishment
for
crack
than
powder
because
it
believed
that
crack
was
more
serious,
and
that
it
believed
that
any
ratio
should
apply
consistently
across
the
guidelines
and
the
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
what
congress
instructed
the
commission
to
consider
in
making
recommendations
to
change
the
existing
state
of
the
law.
we
don't
dispute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
they
have
never
changed
the
100
to
1
ratio.
and
what
i
think
is
significant
about
this
statute
is
what
it
continues
to
say,
and
this
is
on
page
124-a
of
the
government's
brief...
that
"the
recommendations
concerning
an
appropriate
change
to
the
ratio
that
the
commission
might
believe
is
warranted
shall
apply
both
to
the
relevant
statutes
and
to
the
guidelines.
"
this
is
on
the
carryover
sentence
on
pages
24-a
to
25-a.
and
what
i
think
that
this
reflects
is
congress'
recognition
that,
so
long
as
the
mandatory
minimum
statutes
are
pegged
at
100
to
1,
the
guidelines
need
to
follow
suit.
now
if
they're
going
to
change,
that's
fine.
but
they
should
change
in
a
manner
that's
consistent
so
as
to
avoid
unwarranted
disparities
between
defendants
who
are
governed
by
the
literal
mandatory
minimum
statute
and
defendants
who
are
not.
the
alternative
is
you
end
up
with
various
serious
cliff
effects
which
the
commission
itself
was
trying
to
avoid,
where
a
defendant
who
has
50
grams
of
crack
is
sentenced
to
a
minimum
of
10
years.
but
if
you
drop
the
ratio
to
one
to
one,
a
defendant
who
has
49.9
grams--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
this
court
didn't
consider
whether
those
cliff
effects
were
legally
valid
in
neal
because
it
had
no
guideline
before
it.
and
i
did
went
to
get
to
the
other
point
that
i
think
distinguishes
the
legal
context
in
neal
from
the
legal
context
today,
and
that
is,
in
2003,
congress
amended
the
organic
statute
that
governs
the
sentencing
commission's
promulgation
of
guidelines
to
require
that
the
commission
make
audio
starts
its
guidelines
consistent
with
all
pertinent
provisions
of
the
united
states
code.
at
the
time
of
neal,
that
statute
only
required
the
commission
to
be
consistent
with
title
18
and
title
28,
and
the
drug
statute
is
found
in
title
21.
and
the
legislative
evolution
of
this
provision
reflects
that
there
was
concern
that
the
commission
did
not
have
to
honor--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
did
not,
and
the
government--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it
should
have,
and
i
think
that
the
commission's
decoupling
of
its
guidelines
from
the
mandatory
minimums
that
congress
has
provided
produces
an
irrational
disconnect
between
guideline
sentencing
and
sentencing--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
as
a
general
matter,
the
government
accepts
that
a
sentencing
judge
can
revisit,
challenge
the
sentencing
commission's
policy
determinations
as
an
intrinsic
feature
of
an
advisory
guideline
system.
it's
not
because
we
welcome
that
result,
but
because
we
think
that
it
followed
from
this
court's
decision
in
cunningham
and
that
was
expressly
stated
in
rita.
but
this
is
not
an
area
where
the
sentencing
courts
would
be
merely
second-guessing
a
commission
judgment.
they
would
be
second-guessing
a
judgment
of
congress
itself.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but,
justice
breyer,
the
one
time
when
the
commission
tried
to
do
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
wanted
to
make
it
one
to
one,
and
congress
recognized
that
that
would
produce
severe
cliffs
and
said
not
appropriate;
if
you
want
to
change
the
sentencing
statutes
and
guidelines
in
tandem,
that's
fine,
make
a
recommendation.
and
so
the
government's
fundamental
position
here
is
that
congress
has
made
a
judgment
that
until
it
says
otherwise,
sentencing
ratios
of
100
to
1
are
appropriate
to
reflect
the
increased
harms
of
crack.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
two
of
them
work
together
in
tandem,
i
think.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
i
want
to
rely
on
what
the
sentencing
commission
itself
did
before
it
concluded
that
it
disagreed
with
the
100
to
1
ratio
in
the
statute.
and
this
is
set
forward...
forth
at
page
50a
of
the
same
brief,
the
kimbrough
brief.
this
was
the
commission's
original
commentary
where
it
explained,
in
the
first
full
paragraph,
how
it
set
the
basic
levels
for
drug
crimes.
and
it
said
that
it
set
them
because
they
were
either
provided
directly
by
section
841
of
title
21
or,
quote,
"are
proportional
to
the
levels
established
by
statute.
"
and
it
said,
further
refinement
of
the
drug
amounts
beyond
those
mandatory
minimums
was
essential
to
provide
a
logical
sentencing
structure
for
drug
offenses.
and
i
think
what
the
commission--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--2003,
i
believe.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
2003.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
distinguishes
this
area,
justice
scalia,
i
believe,
from
other
guidelines
is
that
the
backdrop
for
sentencing
for
drug
crimes
is
a
mandatory
minimum
statute
that
goes
directly
to
the
sentencing
court.
it's
not
subject
to
the
commission's
intervention
and
it's
not
subject
to
a
district
court's
power
to
disagree
with.
the
sentencing
court
must
use
a
100
to
1
ratio
in
applying
the
mandatory
minimums.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i'm
happy
to
do
just--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
if...
if
it's
sufficient
for
the
court
that
section
841
itself
establishes
the
100
to
1
ratio
and
that's
something
that's
off-limits
for
the
district
courts
to
disagree
with,
i'm
content.
i
think
there
is
additional
data
that
indicates
that
congress
vetoed
attempts
by
the
sentencing
commission
to
vary
from
that
range
and
made
it
clear
that
the
guidelines
formulations
and
the
statute
worked
in
tandem,
which
together
expresses
a
notion
of
quantity
proportionality
tied
to
the
100
to
1
ratio.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
and
the
upshot
of
disagreeing
with
that,
which
is
what
various
district
courts
have
done
but
no
court
of
appeals
has
endorsed,
is
that
every
district
court
could
come
up
with
its
own
ratio
and
that
that
ratio
would
have
to
be
accepted
as
reasonable
so
long
as
there
is
a
cogent,
logical
data
support
for
it.
and
here--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there's
a
floor
in
the
mandatory
minimum,
but
i
think
that
there
are
quite
a
few
sentences
that
are
above
the
mandatory
minimum
and
there
are
sentences
that
are
below
the
mandatory
minimum.
and
in
those
cases--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
didn't
get
that
out
of
my
attempt
to
plumb
the
data,
justice
stevens.
the
sentencing
commission's
most
recent
report
has
a
chart
that
didn't,
to
my
mind,
break
down
adequately
the
figures
so
i
could
answer
your
question.
but
i
do
think
that,
even
if
it's
true,
even
if
80
percent
were
at
the
mandatory
minimum,
that
would
mean
that
as
to
those
20
percent
that
are
not
governed
by
a
mandatory
minimum,
you
could
have
one
district
judge
say,
i'm
going
to
use
one
to
one,
like
the
commission
proposed
in
1995.
another
could
say
i'm
going
to
use
five
to
one,
like
the
commission
proposed
in
1997.
a
third
could
use
20
to
1,
as
the
commission
proposed
in
2002.
and
each
one
of
those
would
have
a
reasonable--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
here
we're
talking
about
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
because
the
courts
of
appeals
are
reviewing
sentences
for
reasonableness.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
wasn't
the
two
statutes
i
was
thinking
of.
what
i
was
thinking
of
is
that
congress
itself
has
said
a
100
to
1
disparity--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--our
position
here,
i
think,
is
consistent
with
our
view
that
you
read
statutes
both
for
what
they
say
and
for
what
they
mean.
and
here
we
are
not
relying
just
on
section
841,
although
i'm
certainly
happy
if
members
of
the
court
believe
that
841
alone
dictates
a
proportionality
rule,
i'm
also
relying
on
the
fact
that
congress
vetoed
the
commission's
attempt
to
break
apart
the
guidelines
in
the
sentencing--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--at
least
the
court
should
do
this
much,
that
when
a
court
of
appeals
is
reviewing
for
reasonableness
a
sentence
imposed
by
a
district
judge,
the
court
of
appeals
should
refract
the
section
3553(a)
factors
through
congress'
existing
judgment
that
a
100
to
1
ratio
is
warranted.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
doesn't.
but,
justice
breyer,
that's,
for
two
different
reasons,
not
an
apt
analogy
for
this.
first
of
all,
congress
applied
the
100
to
1
ratio
at
two
different
points
in
the
sentencing
spectrum.
then
if
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
viewing
shotgun
culpability
as
turning
on
the
length
of
the
barrel,
then
perhaps
there
would
be
a
better
analogy.
but
i
think
here
what
congress
was
focused
on
was
the
relative
culpability
of
crack
offenders
and
powder
offenders.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
but
i
think
that
congress
doesn't
view
the
guidelines
quantity
determinations
as
being
independent
from
its
mandatory
minimum
determinations.
and
that's
why
it
vetoed
the
commission's
unilateral
attempt
to
impose
a
one
to
one
ratio--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
do
come
down
to
the
same
thing,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
sense
that
the
guideline
as
it
exists
today
incorporates
the
100
to
1
ratio.
and
i
believe
that
congress
well
understood
that
it
was
preserving
a
guideline
that
maintains
fidelity
and
consistency
with
its
sentencing
statute
while
sending
the
commission
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
saying
if
we're
going
to
change
this
scheme,
let's
change
it
in
a
consistent
coherent
way.
and
every
district
court
does
not
get
the
power
to
say
we're
going
to
change
what
congress
has
prohibited
the
commission
from
changing,
even
though
we
can't
change
the
mandatory
minimum
statute.
that
is
congress'
sentencing
policy.
we
have
to
impose
that
in
cases
at
the
mandatory
minimum.
but
in
cases
that
aren't
at
the
mandatory
minimum,
the
position
of
the
petitioner
is
basically
district
judges
can
say
to
congress,
you're
completely
wrong.
and
our
position
is
that
under
a
sympathetic
attempt
to
construct
reasonableness
review
that
is
consistent
with
congressional
intent,
a
district
court
can't
do
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because
they
had
no
reason
to
do
it.
until
this
court
decided
booker,
the
guidelines
were
mandatory.
and
they
fully
understood
by
leaving
in
place
a
crack
guideline
that
mirrored
the
statutory--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
aware
that
they
have
legislated
in
this
area
after
booker,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
think
that
since
all
the
court
of
appeals
have
agreed
with
the
single
position
that
district
courts
are
not
free
to
substitute
their
own
ratios
for
the
100
to
1
ratio,
congress
would
not
have
had
a
great
deal
of
reason
to
intervene
in
this
area.
and
what
this
case
will
tell
congress
and
sentencing
courts
is
within
an
advisory
guidelines
regime,
can
congress
make
certain
policy
judgments
and
place
certain
limits
on
what
a
district
court
can
do
that
it
otherwise
would
have
freedom
to
do
in
an
advisory
range.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
only
requirement,
i
believe,
that
exists
under
booker
is
that
judge
not
in
all
cases
be
required
to
find
a
fact
in
order
to
exceed
the
guidelines
range
that
would
be
based
on
the
jury
verdict
alone
or
the
admission
of
guilt
alone.
booker
did
not
say
that
congress
had
to
tolerate
every
single
policy
judgment
that
individual
district
courts
might
make
to
vary
upward.
for
example,
socioeconomic
status.
if
a
particular
judge
felt
in
my
courtroom
college
students
and
white
collar
professionals
deserve
an
automatic
bump
up
in
their
sentences
above
what
i
would
give
anyone
else
because
they
betrayed
the
advantages
that
they
have,
i
think
congress
could
come
along
and
say
that's
not
right.
we
don't
want
socioeconomic
status
to
be
a
variable
that
affects
how
long
someone
goes
to
prison.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
done
in
a
logically
proportional
manner--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
sentencing
commission
at
least
started
where
congress
did.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
they
do
have
to
follow
it
through
exactly
the
way
the
sentencing
commission
did
it,
because
they
don't...
sentencing
courts
today
which
are
sentencing
under
advisory
guidelines
need
not
use
exactly
the
same
base
offense
levels
when
they
come
down
to
final
sentences
after
they've
considered
what
the
commission
has
done.
but
what
they
cannot
do,
i
submit...
and
it
is
more
of
a
negative...
they
cannot
say
fundamentally
the
commission
has
pointed
this
out
and
congress
has
enacted,
but
the
crack
and
powder
guidelines
are
way
out
of
whack.
i
think
that
they're
wrong.
i
think
congress
was
wrong.
and
i'm
going
to
do
everything
i
can
to
try
to
eliminate
that
degree
of
disparity.
and
i
may
not
be
able
to
do
everything
i
want
to.
this
judge
here
was
limited
by
the
120
months
that
was
the
mandatory
minimum.
but
essentially,
he,
as
i
read
the
sentencing
transcript,
thought
it
was
crazy
for
congress
to
treat
crack
and
powder
differently.
for
a
judge
to
say
congress
is
crazy,
i
think,
is
a
sort
of
textbook
example
of
an
unreasonable
sentencing
factor.
the
ultimate
sentence
will
turn
on
how
the
judge
applies
all
of
the
facts
of
the
case
to
the
particular--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--true.
but
this
is
an
area
where
i
don't
think
congress
chose
to
rely
on
the
administrative
expertise
of
the
commission.
it
made
its
own
policy
judgment
on
crack.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
drug
guideline
was
based
on--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
but
entire
drug--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
are
based
on
the
fact
that
congress
made
a
supervening
policy
judgment.
and
in
our
system,
the
policy
judgments
ultimately
pertaining
to
sentencing
belong
to
congress.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
are
some
other
guidelines
where
congress
has
directly
intervened,
but
my
fundamental
point
here
is
that
so
long
as
congress
has
made
a
determination
that
it
has
not
changed,
that
it
wants
100
to
1
as
a
mandatory
minimum
set
point,
district
courts
should
not
be
free
to
say
i
think
congress
got
it
wrong,
i'm
going
to
sentence
on
a
different
paradigm.
the
commission
didn't
think
that
was
appropriate
when
it
promulgated
the
original
drug
guideline,
which
is
why
that
guideline
is
not
based
on
the
same
sorts
of
empirical
data
that
other
guidelines
might
be
deemed
to
be
responsive
to.
but
that
only
reflected
that
the
commission
in
its
original
guideline
respected
that
its
role
was
to
carry
out
congressional
policy,
not
to
disagree
with
or
supplant
congressional
policy,
and
so
long
as
the
commission
was
operating
in
that
vein...
which
i
think
was
correct...
it
follows
a
fortiori
that
sentencing
courts
should
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
would
put
it
differently,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
say
that
congress
has
made
a
legislative
judgment
that
for
crack
purposes,
this
ratio
is
what
is
needed
to
have
a
sufficient
sentence,
and
the
congress
that
decided
that
might
be
wrong.
and
if
the
present-day
congress
decides
to
change
that,
a
new
policy
will
be
established,
but
i
think
that
reading
the
two
statutes
together,
section
3553(a)
and
section
841,
produces
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
legislative
judgment
of
reasonableness;
and
even
if
every
judge
in
the
federal
system
holds
a
different
personal
view,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
statute
has
validated
their
position
over
the
one
that
congress
expressed
in
title
21,
in
a
manner
that
binds
sentencing
courts
irrespective
of
how
the
commission
sorts
out
its
policy
judgments.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
can
interpret
congress
in
section
3553(a)
to
make
unreasonable
what
congress
did
in
section
841.
i
think
reading
all
of
the
statutes
together
would
produce
the
conclusion
that
congress
deemed
that
this
was
the
way
to
achieve
the
purposes
of
sentencing.
crack
is
more
corrosive
in
the
inner
cities.
it
has
different
kinds
of
problems
than
powder.
they
should
be
addressed
in
this
more
severe
sentencing
manner,
and
if
that's
a
policy
judgment
that
warrants
being
revisited,
the
appropriate
body
to
do
it
is
congress,
not
each
individual
sentencing
judge,
formulating
his
or
her
own
ratio,
subject
to
blanket
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
