stephen
g.

the
basis
is
that
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
guidelines.
i
mean,
that...
every
judge
has
his
own
view
of
policy
and
there
is
a
vast
range.
no
point
having
advice...
i
mean,
fine,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
said
it,
and
i
think
that
the
test
is
supposed
to
be
reasonableness,
and
i
think
3553(a)
does
have
a
lot
of
instructions,
and
one
of
the
major
thrusts
is
follow
the
guidelines.
it
doesn't
make
them
mandatory.
but
they're
in
there.
all
right,
so
the
problem
for
me
is
just
what
justice
alito
was
saying:
is
there
a
path
here
between
saying,
well,
judge,
leaving
everything
special
about
your
case
out
of
it...
we're
only
talking
about
a
judge
who
says
there's
nothing
special
about
my
case...
i
disagree
with
the
policy
of
the
commission.
in
such
a
case,
is
there
a
choice
between
saying
that
no
matter
what
the
commission
says,
the
court
of
appeals
must
insist
that
their
district
judges
follow
in
terms
of
a
policy;
and
the
opposite,
which
is
to
say
they
don't
have
to
do
anything
that
the
commission
says,
because
the
commission
is
always
choosing
among
reasonable
choices.
very
rarely...
maybe
you
have
one
in
this
case...
but
very
rarely
is
it
totally
unreasonable.
how
do
we
thread
the
channel?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
extent
that
it's
reasonable,
and
where
we're
talking
about
individual
cases
we've
already
said,
given
the
history
of
our
legal
system,
it's
very
reasonable
to
give
lots
of
discretion
to
the
district
judge.
now
we're
talking
about
what's
reasonable
in
the
context
of
3553(a);
and
i
don't
think
booker
says
one
way
or
the
other
on
that,
nor
i
do
believe
rita
says
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
driven
by
a
congress
that
wrote
guidelines;
and
at
the
last
minute,
in
a
separate
matter
that
we've
taken
out
and
wasn't
put
in
the
initial
draft
added
the
word
"mandatory".
so
the
history
of
3553(a)
is
a
history
of
a
statute
that
is
seeking
uniformity
through
guidelines.
at
least
that's
my
view
of
it.
and
for
purposes
of
the
question,
which
is
an
important
question
to
me,
let's
assume
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
i'm
assuming
now
you
have
not...
you
don't
have
a
good
answer
to
my
question.
you're
saying
either
we
have
to
make
it
unconstitutional,
which
i
don't
think
they
are,
or
you
have
to
say
anything
goes,
and
that
my
question
has
no
answer
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
because
of
the
cliff.
but
the
cliff
is
undoubledly
a
negative,
but
the
cliff
is
not
as
important
as
sometimes
suggested,
for
the
numbers
after
all,
which
relate
punishment
to
amounts
of
drug,
reflect,
(a),
more
seriousness
than
what
you
have...
i
mean
more
people
likely
to
take
it...
but
also
the
role
that
the
person
is
likely
to
play
in
the
organization,
high
or
low,
and
the
likelihood
that
he
is
or
this...
these
groups
of
people
are
big
deal
offenders
or
not,
and
many
other
things.
therefore,
a
system
that
really
is
basically
flat
or
only
rises
slowly
until
you
get
to
the
cliff,
and
then
it
again
rises
slowly
to
the
next
rise,
is
not
an
irrational
system.
it
depends
on
what
those
other
correlations
are.
i
say
that
because
suppose
a
judge,
noticing
the
horrendous
effects
of
this...
that
the
commission
itself
has
listed
and
understanding
that
cliffs
are
not
the
end-all
and
the
be-all
of
guidelines
that
are
rough
correlations,
suppose
a
judge
said:
my
system,
which
we
have
before
us,
which
doesn't
have
the
absolute
numerical
progression,
is
far
more
reasonable
than
the
commission's
system.
there
it
is.
he's
reviewed
the
commission's
policy.
well,
rita
says
sometimes
courts
could.
and
so
what
is
the
law
that
forbids
the
judge
from
doing
that,
at
least
on
occasion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because
congress
has
nowhere
said
that
you
can't
have
cliffs.
you
see,
congress
could
say,
our
rough
judgment
is
that
5
gs
of
hard...
of
crack
really
is
kind
of
a
correlation
with
a
medium-level
gang,
and
50
gs
is
probably
a
correlation
with
a
fairly
high-level
gang.
and
what
has
congress
actually
thought
about
this?
nothing.
they
never
thought
about
it.
so
i
can't
find
an
instruction
there
that
tells
the
commission
that
they
can't
do
it
this
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
wanted
to
abolish
the
whole
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
that's
my
question.
everyone's
assuming
that
"consistent
with
the
statute"
means
a
sentencing
system
that's
smooth
without
cliffs.
and
i'm
sure
every
mathematician
would
agree
with
you,
but
i'm
not
at
all
certain
that
prosecutors
and
defendants
who
have
actual
experience
in
this
would
agree
with
you,
because
there
are
lots
of
arguments
that
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
objective
of
the
statute
to
have
a
few
cliffs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
congress
passes
a
statute
that
says
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
eight
years
for
possessing
a
12-inch
shotgun
unlawfully,
does
that
mean
it
wants
four
years
for
a
6-inch
shotgun?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
the
cliff.
but,
of
course,
i've
been
through...
i
hope
not
being
hypnotized
by
numbers
myself...
that
these
numbers
reflect
underlying
realities
that
are
far
closer
to
the
shotgun
case
than
you
are
prepared
to
admit.
