justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
began...
and
it's
not
just
because
of
my
notepad
but
because
i'm
interested...
you
told
justice
ginsburg
there
are
two
reasons--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
the
government's
cap
is
wrong.
and
i'm
not
even
sure
you
finished
the
first
one.
what
are
the
two
reasons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assume
that
our
decision
will
in
part
drive
the
market
either
way,
what
we
do
will
effect
the
way
paralegals
are
used,
the
way
billing
is
done.
if
that
is
true,
is
there
some
utility
in
simply
following
the
eaja
so
we
give
a
consistent
signal
to
the
market
and
then
if
congress
wants
to
change
it,
it
can?
i
mean--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--rather
than
follow
eaja,
i
mean
follow
1988,
follow
jenkins.
follow
jenkins.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
some
disutilities
from
an
economic
standpoint
in
having
two
structures:
jenkins
for
one
kind
of
cases,
eaja
in
the
other
cases
as
the
government
wants?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
some
disadvantages
to
the
system?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
a
valid
one,
that
you're
running
away
from
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'll
let
you
answer.
it
suggests
this
further
inquiry.
suppose
that
a
solo
practitioner
knows
that
a
paralegal
in
another
firm
is
very
good
at
this
and
he
asks
the
other
lawyer,
may
i
use
your
paralegal,
and
he
just
sends
that
lawyer
the
bill.
what...
how
would
that
be
billed
under
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
both...
they
both
apply,
they
both
apply
to
outside
experts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
again,
you're
not
answering
the
hypothetical.
let's
assume
two
cases:
case
a,
you
hire
an
outside
paralegal
at
$85
an
hour.
he
is
outside,
he
is
independent.
he
is
just
like
the
expert
engineer
in
the
chief
justice
question,
$85
an
hour.
case
two,
it's
your
own
paralegal.
the
prevailing
rate
for
which
you
charge
general
clients
is
$85
an
hour.
why
should
there
be
a
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your...
they
can't
even
charge
$85
an
hour.
