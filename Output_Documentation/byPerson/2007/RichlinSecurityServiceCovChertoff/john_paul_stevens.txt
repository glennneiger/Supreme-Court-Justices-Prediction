may
i
just
ask
on
that
last
point,
does
the
government
agree
that
the
paralegals'
fees
are
subject
to
a
cap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
do
not
agree
with
the
bottom
line
that
they
are
subject
to
cap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--attorney's
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
paralegals'
fees
were
not
generally
treated
as
lawyers'
fees,
but
rather
were
disbursements,
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
this
discretion,
let
me
ask
this
question.
maybe
it's
the
same
question
justice
kennedy
asked,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
of
your
answer.
suppose
you
had
independent
firm
of
paralegals.
i
don't
know
whether
the
market
contains
them,
but
it
surely
could.
a
firm
that
they
are
all
paralegals,
and
they
then
bill
the
law
firm
at
their
own
hourly
rate,
and
then
the
law
firm
in
turn
bills
the
client.
in
that
situation,
would
the
market
rate
of
the
independent
firm
of
paralegals
govern?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
understand
the
government's
position
that
the...
the
result
would
different
if
a
firm
uses
its
own
paralegals
as
opposed
to
outsourcing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
but
under
my
example
they
would
be
paying
the
market
rate
for
paralegals,
and
i
think
you
say
they
could
be
reimbursed
for
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
are
not
market
to
make
business.
i
presume
the
paralegals
would
charge
the
going
rate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
that
they
also
charged
the
market
rate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
go
back
to
the
point,
because
i
think
you
were
cut
off
before
you
went
into
the
full
legislative
history.
i'm
still
concerned
about
the
argument
that
even
if
they
are
not
fees
but
rather
costs,
that
the
costs
should
be
those
that
are
billed
to
the
client.
and
you
think
there
is
some
conclusive
answer
in
the
legislative
history
that
that's
not
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
took
place
when?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
that
time
were
they
billing
paralegal's
fees
at
cost
to
the
client?
was
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--every
expense
that's
reimbursed
at
cost
has
a
profit
element
in
it
for
whoever
performed
the
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
business
or
otherwise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
cap
doesn't
apply
to
expenses,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
cap
does
not
apply
to
reimbursement
expenses
at
cost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
just
the
opposite
just
as
the
chief
justice
suggests.
it
seems
to
me
you're
creating
an
incentive
for
the
firms
to...
to
charge
as
much
as
they
can...
i
mean,
under
market
rates
for
everything
under
the...
under
the
time
of
the
lawyer
himself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
because
other
costs
reasonably
interpret
to
include
overhead.
it's
not
just
the
paper
and
the
accounting
time.
