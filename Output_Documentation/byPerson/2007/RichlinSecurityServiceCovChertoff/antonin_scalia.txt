justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
the
paralegals'
rates
would
also
be
subject
to
the...
to
the
cap.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
couldn't
go
above
the
cap.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
would
insist.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
agent
fees--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
the
problem
exists
whether
or
not
you
make
paralegal
fees
attorney's
fees,
because
agent
fees
are
also
subject
to
the
same
cap.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
agents
were
paid
a
good
deal
less
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
problem
is
going
to
exist
anyway,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
even
if
you
don't
cram
paralegals
into
the
other
expenses,
there
are
going
to
be
other
expenses
that
are
in
the
other
expenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
have
to
have
this
same
problem...
and
what
about
the
overhead
and
so
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
to
understand,
you
claim
that
even
if
they
are
expenses,
they
should...
they
should
be
paid
for
at
market
rate,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that's
no
loss
to
the
government
because
when
you
put
it
into
the
lawyer's
rate,
you
hit
the
ceiling
for
the
lawyer's
rate
that
much
sooner.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
like
that
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
other
case
where
we
used...
i
mean
it
just
gets
worse
and
worse.
do
you
know
any
other
case
where
we've
used
the
legislative
history
of
a
vetoed
bill
to
determine
the
meaning
of
a
later
bill
that
was
not
vetoed?
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
what
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
was
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind.
don't
take...
don't
waste
your
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
have
a...
you
can
submit
it
a
letter.
i've
looked
in
your
brief,
i
can't
find
this
jean
case
that
you
mentioned
on
use
of
veto.
i
have
a
certain
morbid
interest
in
it.
[laughter]
