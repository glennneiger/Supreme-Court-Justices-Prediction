justice
david
h.
souter
but
you...
isn't
that
one
of
the
problems
with
your
argument?
because
there
is
something
very
strange
about
capping
paralegal
fees
at
the
same
amount
that
they
would
cap
a
lawyer's
fees
for,
regardless
of
what
that
amount
is
and
when
they
were
setting
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
looking
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
original
enactment
on
your
theory
at
that
moment.
these
fees
were
legal
fees,
were
attorney
fees,
and
they
were
capped
at
the
same
amount
that
a
lawyer's
time
was
capped
at.
and
that's
just
odd.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
why
wasn't
it
true
in
1980?
you
simply
mean
in
1980
the
two
together
wouldn't
have
gotten
as
high
as
the
cap?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
in
that
case
it
would
bill
the
paralegal
in
the
same
way
it
would
bill,
i
take
it,
the
expense
of,
let's
say,
having
water
tested
in
a
pollution
case.
it
would...
it
would...
i
take
it
it
would
bill
the
client
dollar
for
dollar
what
it
had
to
pay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
add--
justice
david
h.
souter
--they
don't
add
a
profit
and
they
don't
add
a
profit
on
to...
to
travel
expenses
and
things
like
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
so
if
that
is
so,
in
each
case
cost
means
cost
to
the
client,
and
you're
coming
up
with
a
new
category
of
expense,
which
is
cost
to
someone
else,
and
why
should
there
be
a
subcategory
of
expense,
in
which
cost
does
not
mean
cost
to
the
client
when
every
other
category
of
expense
does
mean
cost
to
the
client?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
there
is
a
separate
provision
for
fees.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
