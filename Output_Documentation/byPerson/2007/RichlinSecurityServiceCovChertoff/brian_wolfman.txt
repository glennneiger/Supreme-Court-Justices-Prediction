mr.
brian
wolfman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
circuit
affirmed
an
award
of
attorney
fees
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act,
or
eaja,
to
petitioner
richlin
security
services
company,
but
it
denied
richlin
an
award
for
paralegal
services
at
market
rates
on
the
ground
that
statutory
attorney
fees
do
not
include
work
done
by
paralegals.
the
federal
circuit
was
wrong
because,
as
this
court
has
explained,
the
statutory
term
"attorney
fees"...
and
now
i'm
quoting...
"takes
into
account
the
work
not
only
of
attorneys
but
others
whose
labor
contributes
to
the
work
product
for
which
an
attorney
bills
her
client.
"
employing
that
reasoning
the
court
held,
in
missouri
versus
jenkins,
that
paralegal
fees
are
compensable
at
market
rates
as
attorney
fees
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1988.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
any
reason
eaja
should
be
interpreted
differently.
the
answer
is
no.
and,
indeed,
the
only
potentially
relevant
difference
between
the
two
statutes...
that
eaja
requires
fees
to
be
awarded
at
prevailing
market
rates,
and
section
1988
requires
only
that
fees
be
reasonable...
provides
stronger
support
for
market-based
recovery
of
paralegal
fees
under
eaja
than
it
would
under
section
1988.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
justice
ginsburg,
that
really
is,
when
we
get
down
to
it,
what
the
government's
argument
boils
down
to.
and
i
think
the
cap
is
irrelevant
for
two
reasons,
both
of
which
are
important.
first,
and
let
me...
let
me
first
state
the
argument;
then
i'll
give
you
the
answers.
but
the
argument
that
the
government
posits
is...
taking
a
lead
from
the
federal
circuit...
is
that
paralegal
services
can't
be
compensable
at
market
rates
under
eaja
because
then
paralegal
services
would
be
fully
or
largely
compensable,
while
lawyers'
fees
to
the
extent
that
they
exceed
the
cap
would
not
be.
and
again
there
are
two
answers
to
that:
first,
the
argument
incorrectly
looks
at
eaja
from
today's
perspective
when
lawyers'
rates
generally
exceed
the
fee
cap.
mr.
brian
wolfman
absolutely.
mr.
brian
wolfman
there
is
no
question
about
that
because...
because,
your
honor,
they
are
attorney's
fees.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that's
our
submission.
but...
but
the
problem
with
looking
at
it
at
the
current
vantage
point,
which
is
what
the
federal
circuit
essentially
did,
is
that
at
the
time
eaja
was
enacted,
most
lawyers--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
the
government
would
certainly
agree
that
if
there
are
attorney's
fees,
they
are
subject
to
the
cap.
they
are
not
willing
to
pay
above
the
cap
for
anything.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
but
at
any
rate--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
what
they
believe...
the
government--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--and
i'm
sure
they
can
explain
this
better
than
i
can.
but
what
the
government's
position
is,
is
that
they
are
like
an
out-of-pocket
expense--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--reimbursable
only
at
the
cost
to
the
lawyer.
that's
an
interesting
question,
your
honor,
because
one
could...
one
could
posit
a
situation
20,
30
years
out
from
now,
if
eaja
were
not
amended,
where
even
the
cost
to
the
lawyer
could
exceed
the
cap.
so,
in
a
way,
the
government's
argument
sort
of
collapses
upon
itself.
we...
we...
our
submission
is
they
are
all
attorney's
fees
and
they
are
all
subject
to
the
cap.
but
let
me
go--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
again,
that's...
that's...
i
took
to
be
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
let
me
try
to
answer
it.
first,
as
i
say,
by...
by
positing
that's
a
strange
situation,
which
we
don't
agree
with,
but
even
assuming
it's
a
strange
situation,
again
it
looks
at
the
situation
from
today's
perspective,
not
at
the
time--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
i
don't
believe
it's
odd.
and,
again,
for
two
reasons:
at
that
point...
again,
you
have
to
take
the
perspective
where
they
are
at.
lawyers'
fees
and
paralegal
fees
were
really
capped
at
the
same
point,
but
all
those
fees
were
arrayed,
by
and
large,
under
the
cap
so
that
there
would
be
paralegal
fees
at
a
relatively
low
rate,
junior
associates
at
a
modest
rate,
and
the
senior
partner's
closer
to
the
cap.
mr.
brian
wolfman
by
and
large--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--that
is
true.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
true.
that
is
another
argument
that
could
be
made.
agents,
who
are
individuals
that
are
qualified
by
an
administrative
agency,
in
essence,
to
practice
law
without
the
supervision
of
a
lawyer,
they
are
also
allowed
fees
under
the
administrative
part
of
eaja,
but
not
under
section
2412,
which
is
the
court
part
of
eaja.
mr.
brian
wolfman
yes.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i
would
love
that
opportunity,
your
honor.
the
first,
again,
is,...
and
let
me
come
back
to
this
if
i
didn't
get
it
out
completely...
which
is
that,
again,
it's
looking
at
the...
at
the
problem,
if
there
is
one
from
the...
the
current-day
perspective,
but
what
you
had
at
the
time,
by
and
large,
was
that
lawyers'
and
paralegal
rates
would
be
arrayed
below
the
cap.
it's
just
not
something
that
would
have
been
within
the
contemplation
of
congress.
but
let
me--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--yes.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
might
have
made
a
difference,
but
that
was
not
the
case,
your
honor.
in
fact,
what
the
court
pointed
out
in
missouri
versus
jenkins,
which
was
1989,
nine
years
later,
paralegal
fees...
it
appeared
to
be
that
they
were
separately
billed
in
about
three-quarters
of
all
law
firms.
in
1980
it
was
probably
fewer.
there
was
a
transition
going
on.
but
let
me
give
you
the
court's
response
to
that
problem
in
missouri
versus
jenkins,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
problem.
and
what
the
court
said
was,
whether
they're
separately
billed
or
not,
they
were
subsumed
within
the
lawyer's
rates
like
other
forms
of
overhead.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
missouri
versus
jenkins.
and
the
question
of
how
they
are
billed
doesn't...
doesn't
inform
the
question
of
how
you
interpret
the
term
"attorney's
fees".
that's
what
the
court
said
in
missouri
versus
jenkins
and
what
it
reaffirmed
two
years
later
in
the
west
virginia
hospitals
versus
casey.
now,
let
me,
if
i
could,
get
to
the
second
point
which
justice
kennedy
asked
me
about.
the
second
point
is
that
the
government's
argument
proves
far
too
much,
because
under
the
federal
circuit's
theory,
which
the
government
has
now
adopted,
the
fees
generated
by
law
firm
associates
would
also
not
be
compensable
at
market
rates
because
a
much
higher
percentage
of
an
associate's
billed
rate
would
also
fall
below
the
cap
as
compared
to
the
senior
partners
in
the
firm.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
help
explain
the
problem.
mr.
brian
wolfman
no.
that's
not
my
point,
your
honor.
my
point
is
this:
the...
the
theory
of
the
government's
argument
is
that
you
would...
you
would
be,
in
essence,
giving
too
much
recovery
to
the
lower...
to
the
lower-billed
billing
agents,
whether
they
be
paralegals,
junior
associates,
and
so
forth.
and
it...
when
you
get
up
to
the
senior
partners--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--proportionally.
mr.
brian
wolfman
exactly.
that's
the
argument.
in
all
events,
some
of
those
various
individuals'
rates
will
be
compensated
under
eaja.
our
point
is
that
it
proves
far
too
much
because
the
junior
associates
are
much
more
like
the
paralegals
than
the
senior
associates
at
the
largest
k
street
or
wall
street
law
firm.
and
my
only
point...
my
only
submission...
point
in
that
regard
is
that
it
shows
that
the
government's
argument
proves
too
much
because
it
illustrates
that
the
government's
concern
and
the
federal
circuit's
concern,
the
anomaly
that
they
have
pointed
out,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statutory
term
"attorney
fees"
and
nothing
to
do
with
paralegals,
per
se.
it's
the
phenomenon
that's
at
work
is
the
fact
that
the
rate...
the
hyperinflation
in
the
legal
services
market
as
a
whole
has
outstripped
eaja.
that's
the
phenomenon
on
which
the
federal
circuit,
in
truth,
was
relying,
even
though
they
put
it
to
the
paralegal
question.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
that's...
that's
an
excellent
question.
i
think
it,
in
part,
undermines
the
government's
position
because
what
happened
here
is
that
the
federal
circuit
and
the
board
of
contract
appeals
below
said,
well,
it's
cost
to
the
lawyer,
and
we
are
going
to
do
an
internet
search
and
we
are
going
to
find
what
paralegal
salaries
are
and
divide
it
by
the
requisite
number
of
hours
in
any
year.
and
we
are
going
to
make
it
$35
an
hour,
and
we
are
going
to
determine
that's
the
cost
to
the
law
firm.
but,
of
course,
that's...
that's
not
the
cost
to
the
law
firm.
what
about
the
overhead?
what
about
the
rent,
utilities,
and
so
forth,
what
about
benefits?
so
what
you
would
have
is
a
very
complex
cost
analysis.
now,
you're
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
we
could
do
it
on
some
vague
notion
of
reasonableness.
but
the
problem
is
that
the...
the
fee-shifting
statutes
either
look
to
market
rate
or
actual
cost.
but
what
is
interesting
about
the
actual
cost
argument
here...
and
that's
true
across
the
entire
range
of
fee-shifting
statutes...
and
what's
interesting
about--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--but--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--no,
that
is...
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
that
is
not
correct
because
the
problem
here
is...
and
i'm
using
your
words...
is
that
the
government
is
cramming
a
in-house
professional
services...
service
into
a
place
where
no
court
virtually
in
the
history
of
american
jurisprudence
has
ever
put
it.
out-of-pocket--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--let
me...
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways:
if
you
were
to
preserve
the
ratio,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
in
many
markets,
the
paralegals
are
going
to
get
right
near
the
cap
anyway
or,
you
know,
between
$75
and
$100,
because
we
know
that
many
lawyers'
rates
are
well
above
the
cap...
if
you
preserve
that
ratio--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--yes.
you
could
do
that,
and
what
you
would
have
is
just
a
static
rate
for
all
players
in
the
market,
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
congress
intended
that.
after
all,
i
using
the
term
"prevailing
market
rates"--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
not
quite
market
rate,
but
this
goes
to...
i
said
i
had
two
responses
to
justice
alito's
question.
and
the
problem
is
that
when
we
talk
about
out-of-pocket
expenses,
again,
which
is
where
the
government
is
trying
to
shoe-horn
the
paralegal
services,
we
talk
about
out-of-pocket
expenses
for
the
client,
for
the
prevailing
party.
expenses,
whether
they
are
out-of-pocket
expenses
or
attorney
fees
are...
are
awarded
to
the
prevailing
party,
and
the
cost
faced
by
the
prevailing
party
is
the
cost
to
the
prevailing
party,
what
it
paid
for
the
paralegal
services.
now,
that
will
approximate
the
market
rate,
no
question
about
it.
it
might
not
always
be
synonymous
with
it.
justice
alito,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
congress
could
not
have
done
it
that
way,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
it
did.
after
all,
in
this
statute,
compared
to
other
fee-shifting
statutes,
it
specifically
said
it
wants
to
work
at
the
prevailing
market
rate.
and
the
only
reason
that
in
some
markets
for
some
lawyers
the...
the
ceiling,
the
cap
has
become
a
floor
is
because
of
hyperinflation
in
the
legal
services
market.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
compensability
of
paralegal
services
vis-a-vis
junior
associates,
as
i've
mentioned.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
the
reason
for
that
is...
is
that
there...
there
is
no
suggestion
at
all
that
that's
what
was
being
contemplated
in
this
statute.
and
that
may
be
the
way
that
if
you
had
seen
this
phenomenon
that's
developed,
which
again
is
hyperinflation
in
the
legal
services
market,
you
might
have
written
it
that
way.
it's
true
that
the
courts
have
discretion.
there's
always
a
reasonableness
factor.
but
the
overriding
factor
is
the
market
rate.
the
congress
said
"prevailing
market
rate".
and
to
me,
that
would
be
outside
the
bounds
of
any
discretion
that
had
been
afforded.
mr.
brian
wolfman
no.
i
think...
i
don't
think...
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
the
question.
going
back...
that
takes
us
back
to
missouri
versus
jenkins,
and
what
the
court
said
there
is
that
you
have
this
word
"attorney's
fee",
and
the
way
of
thinking
of
attorney's
fees
is
to
include
everything
that
goes
into
the
labor
of
the
attorney
that
ultimately
gets
billed
to
the
client
and
that
paralegal
services
are
an
aspect
of
that.
two
years
later,
in
west
virginia
university
hospitals,
the
court
made...
made
essentially
the
same
point
again,
which
is
that...
that
at
the
time
that
all
these
fee-shifting
statutes
were
passed,
paralegal
services,
to
the
extent
that
they
existed,
were
traditionally
subsumed
within
the
lawyer's
rate.
and
so
that
once
law
firms
started
billing
for
them
separately--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
saying
traditionally,
well
before
they
were
passed,
they
were
subsumed
to
the
market
rate.
there...
there
came
to
be
a
tradition,
roughly
in
the
'70s
and
early
'80s,
for
the
separate
billing.
and
what
the
court
held
emphatically
in
missouri
versus
jenkins
was
that
the
separate
billing
didn't
tell
you
anything
about
whether
there
were
attorney's
fees.
let
me...
let
me...
if
i
could
extend
my
answer
a
little
bit.
appreciating
what
the
government's
argument
is
here,
the
government's
argument
is
that
if
the
paralegal
fee,
the
paralegal
services,
are
subsumed
within
the
lawyer's
rate,
if
there
were
a
law
firm
out
there
that
still
didn't
do
the
separate
billing,
that
would
be
compensable
as
an
attorney's
fees
when
billed
within
the
lawyer's
rate.
but
if
they're
billed
separately
under
eaja,
the
government's
position
is
they're
not
compensable
at
lawyers'
rates.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
is
true--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--but
that
was
not
true
in
1980.
mr.
brian
wolfman
and
that's
the
point
we
are
making
here.
and
it's
true
that
it
may
not
be,
in
this
day
and
age--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--absolutely.
if
you...
in
most
markets
for
most
lawyers...
we
deal
with
this
extensively
in
our
brief.
we
cite
case
after
case
to
this
effect.
and
i
think...
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
glib
here...
i
think
the
way
to
put
this,
that
in
1980
and
1985,
that
the
statute
covered
virtually
all
lawyers'
fees
rather
comfortably
on
main
street,
if
not
necessarily
on
k
street
and
wall
street.
i
mean...
and
that's
what
the
statute
was
for.
i
know
it's
hard
to
appreciate
that
now,
when
we
see,
you
know,
very
high
rates
from
the
large
law
firms,
but
put
yourself
back
in
that
perspective,
which
is...
in
that
vantage
point,
which
we
try
to
do
in
our
brief.
mr.
brian
wolfman
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well,
i
certainly
think
there's
utility
in
doing
that,
and
congress
can
revisit
this.
the
difficulty
is
that
congress
has
not
revisited
it.
and
congress
could
revisit
this
and
make...
i
think
it's...
it
is
clear
right
now
that
the...
the
purposes
of
the
statute
are
not
being
fully
carried
out
because,
again,
of
the
hyperinflation
in
legal
services.
mr.
brian
wolfman
is
there
some--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i...
of
course,
we
don't
think
there
are,
but
the...
to
be
candid,
the...
the
federal
circuit
pointed
to
one
purported
disadvantage.
the
federal
circuit
claimed
that
to
the
extent
that
there
was
some
incentive
that
would
be
driven
by
a
contrary
decision,
it
would
be
that
lawyers
would
shunt
off
more
work
than
is
efficient
to
paralegals,
and
it's--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i
certainly
agree
that
it
is
unlikely,
but
as
we
point...
very
unlikely.
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
there
is
another
point
that
i
would
make
that
we
cover
quite
extensively
in
our
brief,
which
is
that...
which
is
that...
i
think
you
have
to
step
back
and
think
about
that
for
a
second,
what
the
federal
circuit
did.
the
notion
that
lawyers
are
going
to
shunt
off
work
to
paralegals
that
they
wouldn't
otherwise
have,
there
are...
runs
head
long
into
both
economic
and
ethical
constraints
on
the
profession.
economic,
because
if
that
was
occurring,
i.e.,
people
were...
lawyers
were
giving
paralegals
work
that
they
could
not
sensibly
do,
clients
would,
one,
insist
that
work
not
be
allocated
like
that;
or,
two,
take
their
business
elsewhere.
that's
the
economic
constraints.
if,
in
other
words,
the
whole
premise--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will...
i
believe
that
you
have
greater
experience
on
that
than
i
do.
but
i
think
the
other
answer
to
that
is
the
ethical
constraints.
even
if
there
weren't
economic
constraints...
i
mean,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
sure,
the
paralegal
profession
has
become
an
impressive
one.
they
do
a
lot
of
things
that
lawyers
used
to
do,
no
question.
but
a
lawyer
can't
shunt
off
work
that
they
can't
handle
because
there
are
ethical
constraints.
i
can't,
for
instance,
give
a
paralegal,
say,
responsibility
for...
principal
responsibility
for
writing
an
appellate
brief.
i
could
not
or
would
not
do
that
because
they
can't
do
that,
generally
speaking,
because
of
their
training
and
experience.
so
i
just
think
that
just
falls
apart.
and
as
you
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
fact
that...
of
the
substantial
justification
defense
and
other
reasons
as
well,
it's
unlikely...
and
this
gets
back
to
justice
kennedy's
questions...
unlikely
that
law
firms
will
structure
their
practices
and
businesses
around
this
problem.
the
real
problem,
though,
is
not
an
attack
on
the
government
fisc,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
the
impact
on
the
public
fisc
for
rejecting
the
federal
circuit's
decision
would
be
negligible.
it's
worth
noting,
though,
that
the
federal
circuit's
decision
would
have
an
impact
on
clients
most
affected
by
it.
three
groups
comprise
the
great
majority
of
eaja
applicants:
small
businesses
like
richlin,
disabled
veterans,
and
disabled
social
security
claimants.
in
all
three
situations,
clients
will
lose
if
paralegal
services
are
awarded
at
the
cost
of
those
services
to
their
lawyers.
for
the
latter
two
groups,
veterans
and
social
security
claimants,
federal
law,
in
fact,
requires
that
eaja...
that
the
eaja
fee
be
paid
to
the
claimant.
so,
although
it
makes
economic
sense
for
paralegals
to
work
on
significant
aspects
of
social
security
and
veterans'
cases...
and
that's
set
out
at
some
length
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
association
of
legal
assistants...
the
claimants
will
lose
those
fees
under
the
government's
view
of
eaja.
mr.
brian
wolfman
no.
this
is
how
it
works,
and
that's
why
i
said
federal
law
provides
for
this.
and
let
me
give
you
the
citations.
they
are
also
set
forth
in
footnote
2
of
this
court's
decision
in
scarborough.
the
way
the
social
security
and
veterans
situations
work...
and,
again,
they
comprise
the
majority
of
these
cases...
is
that
the
federal
law
allows
the
lawyer
to
take
a
contingent
fee
out
of
the
back
benefits,
not
to
exceed
20
and
25
percent
of
the
veterans'
or
social
security
claimants'
back
benefits,
respectively.
but
then
what
federal
law
also
provides...
and
the
citations
are
public
law
99-80
section
3
and
public
law
102-572
section
506(c)...
federal
law
provides
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
eaja
fee,
the
lawyer
may
not
double-dip
and
has
to
send
that
fee
directly
back
to
the
client.
so
for
these
relatively
impecunious
claimants,
essentially
chopping
the
paralegal
fee
in
third
or
in
half
or
something
like
that
would
have
a
real
impact
on
claimants.
mr.
brian
wolfman
well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--well--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i'm
certainly
going
to
do
that,
justice
breyer.
the
first
thing
is...
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
members
of
the
court
that...
is
that
that
piece
of
legislative
history
accompanied
vetoed
legislation.
but
let
me
also
say
that,
and
we
explained
this
at
some
length
both
in
our
opening
and
reply
briefs,
that
the
government
relies
on
a
snippet
saying
that
paralegals...
paralegal
services
can
be
awarded,
and
then
it
says
paren,
at
cost.
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
aspects
of
that
same
piece
of
legislative
history
that
point
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
in
terms
of
market
rate
recovery,
and
in
fact
the
court
cites...
excuse
me,
the
committee
cites
a
case
from
the
sixth
circuit,
the
northcross
case,
in
which
paralegal
services
were
awarded
at
market
rates.
mr.
brian
wolfman
and
that
is...
and
that
is
my
next
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
is
that
it
said
"at
cost",
but
at
whose
cost?
and
the
problem
here,
is
that
this
piece
of
fee
shifting
statute
and
every
other
fee
shifting
statute
of
which
i
am
aware
awards
a
fee
to
the
prevailing
party.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
not
to
enrich
the
lawyers.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
provide
incentive
for
lawyers
to
handle
cases
on
behalf
of
clients.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
brian
wolfman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
start
where
the
discussion
left
off.
it
harkens
back
to
some
things
that
mr.
yang
said
towards
the
beginning
of
his
argument.
he
said
that,
that
if
the
federal
circuit
weren't
affirmed,
that
there
would
be
no
meaning
to
the
term
"other
expenses",
but
that's
just
not
so;
it
would
begin
to
lose
its
meaning.
it
means
things
like
travel,
long
distance
phone,
copying,
the
types
of
things
we
think
of
as
out-of-pocket
expenses.
the
problem
here
is
they
are
shoe-horning
a...
the
government
is
shoe-horning
what
is
always
conceived
of
as
an
in-house
professional
service
as
an
out-of-pocket
expense,
and
it
just
does
not
fit
there.
let
me
turn
to
the
legislative
history
and
i'd
like
to
do
two
things
with
that
before
i
close.
the
first
is,
let's
presuppose
that
it
should
be
given
some
weight,
as
justice
breyer
has
suggested,
and
the
problem
is
that
it
just
doesn't
bear
the
weight
that
the
government
gives
the
report.
if
you
look
at...
and
this
is
discussed
at
length
at
page
12
of
our
reply
brief...
let's
turn
for
instance
to
the
administrative
conference
report.
here's
what
it
says.
it's
a
46
federal
register
32913.
it
says
that:
with
regard
to
expenses,
they
should
be
compensable
whenever
the
lawyer,
quote,
"ordinarily
charges
clients
separately
for
such
expenses.
"
that's
the
situation
today
with
paralegal
expenses.
then
it's
true
that
the
acus,
the
administrative
conference,
did
not
issue
a
hard
and
fast
rule
with
respect
to
paralegal
expenses.
but
that
of
course
is
because
the
market
wasn't
uniform
at
that
time
as
it
is
today.
today
it's
nearly
ubiquitous
that
paralegal
services
are...
are
separately
billed.
but
listen
to
what
the
court
said...
said:
indeed,
we
decline
to
issue
because,
quote,
"practices
with
respect
to
charging
clients
for
paralegal
time
vary
depending
on
locality
and
field
of
practice.
"
but
that
statement
reflects
exactly
our
position.
that
the
rule
the
court
embraced
in
jenkins
is
that
the
compensability
of
paralegal
services
should
replicate
prevailing
practices
in
the
market.
now
let
me
just
end
by...
by...
on
this
note.
if,
there
is
also
the
question
raised
about
whether
you
should
give
any
weight
to
this...
this
report
at
all.
we
say
that
you
should
not
for
the
reasons,
essentially
in
justice
scalia's
last
question
on
that
topic;
but
we
do...
we
do
talk
about
why
the
jean
decision
use
of
that
report
does
not
wear
the
weight
that
the
government
gives
us,
and
that's
on
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief,
our
reply
brief.
and
the
reason
is,
is
because
in
jean,
no
one
brought
to
the
court's
attention
in
any
of
the
briefs
the
problem
that
the...
that
legislative
history
accompanied
vetoed
legislation.
it
was
never
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
in
the
scarborough
case
three
years
ago,
neither
the
majority
opinion
nor
the
dissent
cited
that
report.
mr.
brian
wolfman
that
might
be
true
in
some
circumstances,
but
that's
not
what
happened
in
1985.
there
was
an
extensive
house
report
accompanying
that
legislation.
there
was
no
senate
report.
the
house
report--
mr.
brian
wolfman
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
there
were
some
other
things
taken
up
in
the
house
report
and
the
house
report,
quite
extensive,
says
nothing;
it's
silent
on
the
question
of
paralegal
services.
look,
let
me
just
say
as
i
close...
may
i
answer
the
question?
let
me
just
say
as
i
close
that...
that
if
the
court
wishes
to
look
at
that
report,
at
the
very
best
for
the
government,
it's
a
wash.
thank
you
very
much.
