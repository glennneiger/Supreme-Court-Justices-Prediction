john
g.
roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-1717,
richlin
security
service
versus
chertoff.
mr.
wolfman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
is
your
point
there
that
most
associates
are
billed
at
less
than
$125
an
hour?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
too
much
money
proportionally.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
"traditionally
subsumed
in
the
lawyer's
rate.
"
are
you
suggesting,
when
this
statute
was
passed,
they
weren't
billed
separately
to
the
client?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's...
i
saw
that
analysis.
this
act
only
applies
when
the
government's
position
is
not
substantially
justified.
people
are
not
going
to
structure
their
billing
arrangements
assuming
the
government's
position
is
not
even
going
to
be
substantially
justified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
point
makes
some
assumptions
about
the
relative
abilities,
say,
of
junior
associates
and
senior
paralegals,
and
i'm
not
sure
are
well
founded.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
pertinent...
is
that
pertinent
on
the
cap
questions
we've
been
discussing
too?
i
mean,
if
you're
representing
a
disabled
veteran,
is
the
lawyer
typically
charging
more
than
$125
an
hour?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
of
course
they
may
mean...
may
have
meant
costs
to
the
client.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
the
relevant
one
was
of
course
on
a
legislation
that
wasn't
passed,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
and
it
might
be
quite
different
for
private
practitioner.
your
benefits
for
health
care
will
probably
cost
you
a
lot
less
than
private
practice
and
doesn't
that
make
the
paralegal
fees
quite
different
than
the
other
items
of
expenses
that
are
listed?
you
know,
expert
witnesses,
you
get
a
bill,
that's
how
much
it
costs
the
lawyer.
studies,
analysis,
engineering
reports,
you
don't
have
to
figure
overhead
benefits
with
respect
to
any
of
those.
all
of
a
sudden
you
throw
in
another
item,
paralegal
costs,
you
put
those
under
costs,
and
now
you've
got
to
go
through
this
elaborate
calculation
that
is
going
to
be
not
worth
it,
almost,
for
a
typical
firm
representing
a
small
client.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
most
firms
an
engineering
report
would
be
outside
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
that
wasn't
justice
kennedy's
question.
his
was
the
outsourced
paralegal
is
better
at
a
particular
task.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your...
this
question
only
arises
when
the
position
of
your
client
was
not
substantially
justified.
now
under
those...
and
it
was
designed,
to
some
extent,
to
penalize
you
because...
because
of
that
fact.
why
should
we
adopt
a
construction
that,
in
effect,
penalizes
the
client
who
has
had
to
face
the
federal
government
when
the
federal
government's
position
was
not
substantially
justified?
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay
the
paralegal
fees
at
market
rates,
but
they
are
only
goes
to
get
compensation
at
cost.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
a
stretch
to
suggest
in
a
situation
where
they
pass
a
law
that
only
applies
to
individuals
or
small
businesses
where
they
put
a
cap
in
and
so
on,
that
another
way
that
we
are
going
to
prevent
damage
to
the
fisc
was
to
treat
paralegal
expenses
as
costs
rather
than
at
market
rate.
i
suspect
that
was
not
foremost
in
their
mind.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
assumes
that
when
they
said
"costs",
that
they
meant
costs
to
the
firm
as
opposed
to
costs
to
the
client.
and
that,
i
think,
is
entirely
an
open
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
to
belabor
the
point
it
meant
that
the
people
who
drafted
the
senate
report
may
have
meant
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
know
what
the
president's
view
was
on
that
question
when
he
signed
the
legislation
into
law,
which
is
what
he
was
required
to
do
before
it
became
law
and
which
he
did
not
do
under
the
prior
bill?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
this
is
the
same
question
justice
breyer
asked,
but
i
haven't...
i
didn't
grasp
the
answer.
under
your
system
it
would
make
sense
for
lawyers
to
charge
separately
for
photocopy
services,
telephone
services,
so
on
because
then
they
are
not
going
to
be
subject
to
the
attorney
fee
cap.
and
they
may
think,
look,
the
difference
between
cost
and
market
rate
is
relatively
small;
the
difference
between
our
hourly
rate
and
$125
is
large.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
saying
if
we
adopt
your
position,
isn't
it
going
to
be,
i
guess,
worse
for
your
client
because
firms
will,
as
i've
been
told
firms
sometimes
do,
charge
separately
for
things
at
a
higher
rate
than
their
cost?
they
will
charge
higher
rate
for
photocopy
services
because
they
try
to
factor
into
it
overhead
and
things
like
than
cost.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
would
say...
i
would
say
that
it's
now
traditional
for
firms
to
charge,
say,
more
for
their
photocopy
services
than
it
cost
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
missed
my
point.
it
was
even
if
you're
right,
50
cents
and
they
can
only
charge
15
cents,
they
have
an
incentive
to
separately
charge
for
photocopying,
because
they
get
the
15
cents,
and
otherwise
it's
going
to...
they
are
going
to
lose
it
over
the
cap
if
you
say
no
that's
part
of
the
attorney's
fees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
there
are
occasions,
aren't
there,
when
the
government
is
entitled
to
attorney's
fees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
know
how
you
bill
paralegal
times...
time
in
those
situations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
often
don't
bill
them
separately.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
yang.
mr.
wolfman,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
think
justice
breyer
is
correct,
isn't
he,
that
there
was
no
reason
for
the
senate
to
sort
of
redo
a
report
that
they
had
already
done
on
a
bill
that
was
substantially
identical?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was
no
senate
report
because
they
had
done
it
just
the
previous
year.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
