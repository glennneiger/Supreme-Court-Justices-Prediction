if...
if
paralegal
charges
are
not
fees
but
are
other
expenses,
what
would
be
the
standard
for
determining
the
rate
at
which
they
would
be
compensable?
would
it
necessarily
be
cost
under
this
statute
or
would
it
simply
be
what
is
reasonable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if...
if
it's
simply
reasonableness...
because
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statute
that
says
that
all
non-fee
expenses
are
compensable
at
cost...
if
it's
simply
reasonableness,
would
it
be
possible
to
say
that
what
would
be
reasonable
would
be
a
rate
that
preserves
the
ratio
between
attorneys'
fees
and
paralegal
fees
that
existed
at
the
time
when
the
statute
was
enacted
so
that
you
wouldn't
have
the
problem
of
attorneys
being
compensated
at
the
same
rate
as
paralegals?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
if
the
ratio...
if
lawyers
were...
i
know
that
if
lawyers
were
compensated
at
$125
an
hour
when
this
was
enacted
and
paralegals
were
compensated
at
$75,
then
it
would
be
a
2-1
ratio,
and
you'd
preserve
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well
on
that
point,
does
the
statute
say
that
all
non
fee
expenses
are
compensable
at
cost?
or
are
you
arguing
that
the
work
that's
done
by
paralegals
is
a
study
or
analysis
project?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
which
is
it,
is
it
a
study
analysis
or
project?
that
seems
like
a
strange
way
of
describing
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
after
prevailing
in
a
contract
dispute
against
the
government,
petitioner
richlin
security
service
company
filed
an
application
to
recover
its
fees
and
other
expenses
of
litigation
pursuant
to
section
504(a)(1)
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
the
fees
and
expenses
richlin
incurred
included
sums
paid
to
its
attorneys
for
paralegal
services.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
how
awards
for
paralegal
fees
should
be
calculated
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
the
act
provides
that
an
eligible
party
may
recover
its
fees
and
other
expenses
incurred
in
successful
litigation
by
or
against
the
federal
government.
the
act
defines
the
term
fees
and
other
expenses
to
include
"reasonable
attorney
or
agent
fees"
and
"reasonable
cost
of
any
study,
analysis,
engineering
report,
test
or
project".
the
statute
instructs
agencies
to
look
to
prevailing
market
rates
to
calculate
fees
for
attorneys
and
agents
but
it
makes
no
mention
of
paralegals.
from
this
omission,
the
federal
circuit
reasoned
that
the
act
does
not
consider
fees
for
paralegal
services
as
fees
at
all
but
rather
as
other
expenses
recoverable
only
at
the
reasonable
cost
of
the
services
to
the
party's
attorneys.
we
disagree
with
that
analysis.
the
distinction
that
the
federal
circuit
drew
between
the
treatment
of
fees
and
other
expenses
is
not
supported
by
the
statutory
tax.
it
is
also
at
odds
with
our
decisions
interpreting
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act,
42
u.s.c.
section
1988.
those
decisions
lead
us
to
conclude
that
the
term
“attorney's
fees
in
equal
access
to
justice
act”
refers
to
compensation
not
only
for
the
attorney's
personal
labor
but
also
for
the
labor
of
paralegals
who
contribute
to
the
attorney's
work
product.
since
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
expressly
provides
that
attorney
fees
are
recoverable
at
prevailing
market
rates,
it
follows
that
paralegal
fees
must
be
as
well.
the
government's
arguments
from
the
equal
access
to
justice
act's
legislative
history
and
from
considerations
of
public
policy
and
sovereign
immunity
do
not
persuade
this
otherwise.
for
these
reasons
discussed
at
greater
length
in
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
hold
that
a
prevailing
party
that
satisfies
the
equal
access
to
justice
act's
other
requirements
may
recover
its
paralegal
fees
from
the
government
at
prevailing
market
rates.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
also
unanimous
except
that
justice
scalia
does
not
concur
in
part
iii-a
of
the
court's
opinion,
and
justice
thomas
does
not
concur
in
part
ii-b
or
part
iii
of
the
court's
opinion.
