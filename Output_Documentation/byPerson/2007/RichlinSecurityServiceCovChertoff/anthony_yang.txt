mr.
anthony
yang
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
eaja
authorizes
federal
agencies
to
award
two
distinct
categories
of
litigation
expenses
against
the
united
states:
fees
and
other
expenses.
the
most
natural
reading
of
attorney's
fees
is
one
that
embraces
an
attorney's
time,
payments
for
an
attorney's
time,
whereas
the
broader
term
"other
expenses"
naturally
encompasses
outlays
that
are
paid
by
an
attorney
during
its
representation
of
a
client
including
the
cost
of
paralegals
whose
work
may
be
necessary
for
the
preparation
of
a
client's
case.
congress
recognized
this
distinction
between
attorney's
fees
and
other
expenses
when
it
enacted
eaja
in
1980.
the
relevant
senate
report,
like
eaja's
house
report,
stated
that
the
ceiling
on
"attorney's
fees"--
mr.
anthony
yang
--actually
this
is
even
before
eaja
lacks
the
first
time,
this
is
upon
eaja's
initial
enactment
in
1980,
there
was
a
senate
report
and
a
house
report
and
both
have
functionally
identical
language.
the
senate
report
states
that
quote,
"attorney's
fees
relates
only
to
the
compensation
of
lawyers
themselves.
"
and
then
goes
on
to
explain
that
costs
connected
with
their
representation
of
a
particular
interest
in
a
proceeding
is
not
affected
by
the
limitation
that
is
the
cap
on
attorney's
fees.
when
congress
then
re-enacted
eaja
after
its
repeal,
congress
again
made
clear...
and
this
is
the
report
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
were
referring
to...
made
clear
that
the
eaja
fees
includes
an
attorney's
out-of-pocket
expenses,
and
that
those
out-of-pocket
expenses
were
illustrated
by
the
specific
example
of
paralegal
time
being
reimbursed
at
cost.
mr.
anthony
yang
justice
ginsburg,
the
government
agrees
that
more
than
simply
salary
would
be
reimbursable
at
cost.
and
i
think
the
appropriate
way
to
calculate
cost
in
the
context
of
paralegals
would
be...
would
parallel
how
the
government
calculates
its
cost
for
attorneys
when
the
government
seeks
attorney's
fees.
and
what
the
government
does
is
it
uses
salary
as
a
baseline
and
then
adds...
for
the
government
29
or
approximately
29
percent
of
salaries
for
other
benefits.
and--
mr.
anthony
yang
--mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
some
of
the
premises
that
you
had.
first,
with
respect
to
the
analysis
and
reports
and
such,
those
are
not
always
things
that
are
done
outside
a
law
firm.
the
statutory
text,
in
fact,
allows
the
reimbursement
of
costs
for
any
study,
analysis,
report,
test
or
project;
it's
not
limited
to
things
that
are
done
outside
of
a
firm.
i
mean
also
be--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
that's
an
engineering
report,
except
for
maybe,
some
intellectual
property
firms
but--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
there
is
now
two
questions
in
the
air.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
when
a
paralegal
is
outsourced,
which
is
your
question,
there
is
two
potential
situations.
one
may
be
that
the
paralegal
is
less
expensive,
and
if
that
were
the
case
you
would
think
that
firms
would
normally
outsource
their
paralegals
if
it's
less
expensive
to
obtain
them
from
the
outside
than
the
inside.
mr.
anthony
yang
the
outsourced
paralegal
is
better,
it
may
be
that
the
actual
cost
to
the
firm
is
the
cost
that
the
firm
pays
for
that
paralegal
to
the
third
party.
mr.
anthony
yang
in
fact
that's
right--
mr.
anthony
yang
--and
not
add
profit
on
to
that...
that
paralegal
as
well.
mr.
anthony
yang
right.
mr.
anthony
yang
justice
souter,
every
other
category
does
not
mean
cost
to
the
client.
in
fact,
eaja
specifically
provides
for
fees,
but
the
fees
are
based
on
the
prevailing
market
rates
for
similar
services.
mr.
anthony
yang
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
yang
but
in
that
context
a
client
does
not
incur
any
legal
fees,
have
any
obligation
to
pay
any
fees,
and
courts
routinely
award
eaja
fees
when
there
has
been
no
cost
to
the
client
in
fees,
and
similarly,
even
if
the
client
has
an
obligation
to
pay
the
cost
in
those
circumstances...
where
for
instance
a
firm
is
providing
pro
bono
services
or
a
legal
services
organization
is
providing
pro
bono
services
to
a
client,
the
client
does
not
have
to
incur
or
pay
the
costs.
the
question
is
whether
those
costs
have
been
ultimately
incurred
and
have
been
incurred
at
the
rate
that
the
firm
has
incurred
the
cost
on
behalf
of
the
client.
mr.
anthony
yang
it
would
be
the
rate
that
is
ultimately
paid.
if
you're
outsourcing
the
paralegals
it
would
be
the
rate
paid
by
the
firm
for
those
paralegals.
now
it
may
also
be,
for
instance--
mr.
anthony
yang
--the
result
is
not
different,
your
honor.
the
result
is
the
same
in
the
sense
that
the
firm's
cost--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
the
market
rate.
it
may
would
be
what
they
are
paying,
which
may
well
reflect
the
market
rate.
mr.
anthony
yang
if
they
did.
mr.
anthony
yang
it
may
be.
but
if
it's
the
market
rate,
there
would
presumably
be
no
incentive
for
a
firm
to
outsource--
mr.
anthony
yang
--there
should
be
a
difference,
your
honor,
because
with
respect
to
outsourced
firms,
there
is
no
concern
that
a
firm
is
going
to
add,
well...
if
the
firm
is
only
going
to
bill
at
its
cost,
the
firm
is
not
going
to
add
additional
profit
to
the
outsourced
paralegal.
so
if,
for
instance,
a
firm
paid
$85,
under
our
view
the
firm
could
not
turn
around
and
charge
$95
to
the
client.
likewise...
and
the
reason
that
this
is
important
under
your
context--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
that's
correct
if
their
cost,
actual
cost
would
be
less
in
house.
and
the
reason
that's
important
is
because
in
eaja,
unlike
section
1988,
there
are
several
statutory
differences.
one,
eaja
provides
for
other
expenses,
so
the
term
"attorney's
fees"
is
not
the
only
terms
that
needs
to
be
construed
by
the
court.
other
expenses
needs
to
be
construed
in
a
manner
that
gives
it
meaningful
effect.
and
congress
recognized,
again,
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
extent
you
could
disagree
on
the
meaning
of
other
expenses,
congress
was
very
clear
both
in
1980
and
then
again
in
1984
that
other
expenses,
attorney's
fees
do
not
include
things
that
attorneys
pay
and
only
compensates
attorneys
for
their
own
hourly
rate.
and
the
reason
that
the
fee
cap
was
important
is
because
eaja,
as
this
court
recognized
in
underwood,
is
not
intended
to
be
fully
compensatory.
if
the
cap
for--
mr.
anthony
yang
--justice
ginsburg,
under
jenkins'
rationale,
jenkins
recognized
that
when
there
is
not
another...
another
box
of
other
expenses,
where
in
a
statute
which
was
intended
to
be
fully
compensatory,
that
attorney's
fees
necessarily
must
include
compensation
for
all
types
of
costs
that
a
lawyer
might
incur
in
the
presentation/representation
of
a
client.
that
works
for
section
1988.
but
if
that
rationale
were
applied
to
the
eaja
context,
if
attorney's
fees
were
given
the
same
meaning
in
eaja,
there
is
little
or
no
work
for
other
expenses
to
be
done
in
the
statute,
because
already
you've
pushed
all
of
those
expenses
into
the
box
of
attorney's
fees
and--
mr.
anthony
yang
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
that
you
would
adopt
our
construction
is
because
congress
is
balancing
more
than
the
intent
to
provide
compensation
for
prevailing
parties
in
eaja.
it
was
also
intending
to
balance
the
effect
on
the
federal
fisc
and
limit
the
government's
exposure
as
a
means
of
passing
the
act.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
legislative
history
illustrates
that,
in
fact,
paralegals
and
other
costs--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
the
relevant
page
of
the
legislative
history
in
1984
that
you're
talking
about
explains
that
congress
wanted
to
adopt
the
views
of
the
administrative
conference
in
its
model
rules,
and
goes
on
to
quote
the
administrative
conference--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
that's
a
problem
with
all
legislative
history.
mr.
anthony
yang
the
president
did
not
express
a
view,
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
legislative
history
in
1984
dealt
with
language
that
was
identical
to
that
ultimately
passed
by
the
senate...
by
congress
and
signed
by
the
president.
and
that
legislative
history
explains
and
quotes
the
administrative
conference
that
says
that
what
should
be
awarded
is
an
award
of
reasonable
expenses
of
the
attorney.
mr.
anthony
yang
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
anthony
yang
this
court
has
twice
cited
unanimous
opinions,
the
same
report
that
we
cite
here,
one
of
which
was
in
the
jean
opinion.
in
fact,
the
court
not
only
cited
the
senate
report,
but
also
cited
the
house
report
to
the
1984
bill.
mr.
anthony
yang
jean?
mr.
anthony
yang
pardon
my--
mr.
anthony
yang
--in
fact
congress
recognized
that,
justice
breyer,
when
it
re-enacted...
when
it
readdressed
the
bill
in
1985,
the
relative
legislative
history
specifically
references
the
bill
that
existed
before
that
it
was
reported
by--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
the
theory
of
the
bill
was
that
attorney's
fees
would
be
based
at
prevailing
market
rates,
and
that
prevailing
market
rates
would
embody
a
certain
set
of
costs
that
might
be
reimbursed.
i
would
think
that
the
prevailing
practice
is
not
to
bill
separately
for
the
kitchen
sink,
but
as
the
court
explained
in
missouri
versus
jenkins,
missouri's
analysis
would
extend
to
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer.
it
explains
that
reasonable
attorney's
fees
had
to
cover
all
kinds
of
costs,
including
the
costs
of
secretaries,
messengers,
librarians
or
janitors
who
might
well
be
cleaning
the
kitchen
sink.
mr.
anthony
yang
the
cap
in
eaja
was
imposed
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
anthony
yang
yes.
it
was.
it
was
in
the
senate
bill.
it
was...
it
was
removed
by
subcommittee,
reinserted
by
the
full
judiciary
committee,
passed
the
senate,
came
over
to
the
house
and
continued
on
for
passage
in
1980.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
justice
ginsburg,
we
are
relying
not
only
on
the
1984
but
also
on
the
1980
legislative
history,
which
although
it
does
not
specifically
refer
to
paralegals,
explains
that
in
connection
with
the
term
"attorney's
fees"
and
the
ceiling
on
attorney's
fees...
and
i'll
quote
again
from
the
senate
report,
which
was
the
first:
ceiling
on
attorney's
fees
relates
only
to
the
compensation
of
lawyers
themselves.
and
then
goes
on
to
say:
that
does
not
include
other
costs
connected
with
their
representation
of
a
particular
interest
in
a
proceeding.
and
when
congress
did
that,
it
specifically
recognized
that
it
was
taking
a
different
approach
than
that
taken
in
other
fee-shifting
statutes.
the
very
next
sentence
explains
that
the
committee
notes
that
this
section
is
not
intended
to
limit
or
affect
the
computation
of
reasonable
attorney's
fees
under
any
other
provision
of
law,
and
gave
as
an
example
the
civil
rights
act.
that
is
section
1988.
so
congress
knew
from
the
very
beginning
that
its
treatment
of
attorney's
fees
as
being
limited
only
to
attorneys
and
the
larger
more
capacious
category
of
other
expenses,
capturing
all
other
costs
that
an
attorney
might
incur
in
the
representation
of
a
client
was
one
that
was
both
different
from
other
statutes,
and
one
that
was
intended
by
congress.
and
it's
not
reflected
not
only
by
the
legislative
history,
but
again
by
fee
caps.
the
fee
caps
i
believe
you
started
here
were
specifically
designed
and
set
by
reference
to
attorney's
rates,
the
exceptions
to
the
fee
caps...
again
specifically
reference
attorneys.
there
is
an
exception
that
you
can
exceed
the
fee
cap
when
there
is
a
limited
availability
of
the
attorneys
qualified
at
the
proceedings
involved.
and
it
would
be
anomalous
in
that
context
where
congress
has
paid
particular
attention
to
the
billing
rates
of
attorneys,
set
the
cap
based
on
attorney's
rates
with
no
reference
to
paralegals
to
assume--
mr.
anthony
yang
--that
congress
intended--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
the
legislative
history
when
you...
again,
if
you
look
to
what
congress
was
talking
about,
both
the
administrative
conference
rules
and
the
quotation
of
the
administrative
conference
rules--
mr.
anthony
yang
--this
was
in
1984.
mr.
anthony
yang
in
fact,
your
honor,
there
was
a
dispute
that
the
legislative
history
speaks
to
the
controversy
that
evolved
regarding
the...
whether
other
expenses
of
the
term
would
include
more
than
what
was
specifically
enumerated
in
the
statute.
and
what
we
cite
to
in
our
brief
as
a
footnote
at
page
28,
footnote
12,
there
was
a
dispute.
several
courts
had
concluded
that
paralegals
were
reimbursed
at
cost.
in
fact,
the
northcross
decision,
which
the
committee
reports,
specifically
references...
concluded
that
it
was
costs
to
the
attorney,
as
this
court
recognized
in
jenkins.
footnote
seven
of
jenkins
discusses
the
northcross
decision
and
explains
that
northcross
awarded
out-of-pocket
expenses
for
attorney's
fees
at
the
cost
to
the
attorney.
and
so,
when
you
take
that
controversy
which
had
evolved
regarding
how
you
compensate
these
other
expenses...
and
specifically
paralegal
expenses...
along
with
congress'
statement
that
it
intended
to
compensate
out-of-pocket
expenses
incurred
with
connection
to
a
case,
the
model
rules
and
northcross
when
you
combine
that
with
the
statement
that
paralegals
are
to
be
compensated
at
cost,
seems
clear
to
us
that
congress
is
intending
that
in
contrast
to
attorney's
fees,
which
have
a
profit
element
embedded
in
them
and
a
profit
element
capped
by
the
fee
cap
that
congress
imposed
in
1980...
that
when
read
together,
it
seems
fairly
clear
to
us
that
congress
intended--
mr.
anthony
yang
--but
when
it's
within
the
control
of
the
firm--
mr.
anthony
yang
--within
the
control
of
the
firm,
there
is
a
particular
danger
that
the
firm
can
inflate
its
own
costs.
whereas
when
it's
going
out
to
the
market,
of
course,
it's
not
going
to
control
the
profits.
mr.
anthony
yang
you're
asking
about
the
incentives
that
firms
might
have.
mr.
anthony
yang
overhead
profit.
we
don't
believe
it's
actually
going
to
change
any
practices,
because
ultimately,
when
you're
looking
at
what
costs
are
reimbursable
under
eaja,
it
has
to
be
costs
that
are
not
traditionally
already
paid
for
in
the
attorney's
fees.
so
you
have
to
look
not
to
the
practice
of
the
specific
firm
that's
at
issue,
you
have
to
look
at
the
prevailing
practice.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
if
that's
the
case
under
our
reading,
of
course,
we
would...
we
would
say
that
that
is...
that
is
not
a
type
of
expense
that
was
contemplated
by
eaja,
because
congress
already
provided
for
profits
that
attorneys
get
from
representing
a
party
within
the
attorney
fee
and
cap
that.
the
whole
idea
of
a
cap
is
to
limit
the
reimbursement
that
a
firm
might
get
from
eaja
below
what
the
prevailing
market
rates
for
the
services
would
be.
if
the...
the
prevailing
market
rates
were
below
the
cap,
the
cap
never
comes
into
play.
the
only
reason
for
that
cap
is
to
limit
compensation
below
market
rates.
and
it
would
be
anomalous
to
allow--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
didn't
catch
you.
mr.
anthony
yang
precisely,
because
in
our
view
expenses
are
at
cost
and
it
is
not...
you
don't
have
the
same
danger
of
having
firms
imbedding
profit
within
their
own
rate.
mr.
anthony
yang
but
again,
and
under
our
view
if
they
were
to...
if
a
firm
were
to
charge,
say,
50
cents
for
a
photocopy
and
it
only
cost
10
or
15
cents
for
that
photocopy,
under
our
view
the
firm
would
only
be
reimbursed
for
our
for
the
15
cents.
the
not
an
incentive
to
bill
the
client
for
anything
more--
mr.
anthony
yang
--overhead,
we
don't
believe,
is
fairly
attributable
to
a
particular
case.
and,
in
fact,
congress
was
specific
about
this
particular
point
on
overhead
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
anthony
yang
i
guess
you're
right
to
some
extent
there
would
be
incentive
to
shift
out
costs
even
though
there
would
be
less
of
an
incentive
than
shifting
out
costs
plus
profit.
but
the
reason
that...
that
the...
the
reason
that
we
think
that
that's
a
bit
different
is
because,
again,
congress
intended
for
the
profit
making
part
of
a...
an
attorney's
compensation
to
come
out
of
attorney's
fees,
and
then
are
capped.
and
there
is
very
little
incentive
to...
to
shift
out
fees
unless
the
market
itself
is
already
doing
that.
and
if
the
market
itself
is
already
billing
for
photocopies,
then
that's
what
you're
going
to
get.
even
if
you
didn't
separately
charge
for
photocopies
as
part
of
your
rate,
you
could
bill
under
eaja.
the
market
is
providing
for
photocopies
being
billed
separately,
you
can
simply
submit
a
request
for
photocopies.
mr.
anthony
yang
it's
at
496
u.s.
154.
and
it's...
i
believe
it's
cited,
it's
commissioner,
ins
versus
jean.
and
i
apologize
if
it's
not
there,
but
i
thought
it
was.
yes.
no.
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
yang
as
a
general
rule,
in
fee-shifting
statutes
that
are
like
section
1988,
that
is
in
fact
the
rule.
but
the
rule
that
similar
words
are
given
a
similar
meaning
readily
yields
when
there
is
indication
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
same
to
apply
here,
and
in
fact
for
instance
in
the
fogerty
versus
fantasy
case,
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
approach
of
adopting
the
understanding
of
reasonable
attorney's
fees
applied
in
other
fee-shifting
statutes,
because
it
found
that
the
policy
and
legislative
history
of
the
copyright
act
required
or
at
least
suggested
that
congress
intended
something
else.
and
here,
not
only
do
we
have
a
different
legislative
history,
we
have
fundamentally
different
statutory
text.
there
is
a
second
category
of
other
expenses
that
must
be
given
meaning
in
conjunction
with
attorney's
fees.
it
did
not--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it's
either
a,
it
can
be
a
study
or
analysis
or
at
least
analogous
to
that
type
of
a...
a--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it
can
be...
it
can
be
a
project,
for
instance
in
this
case,
the
paralegal
compiled
the
relevant
information
regarding
how
much
wages
needed
to
be
developed,
repaid
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
how
much
taxes
needed
to
be
reimbursed.
that
could
be
understood
as
a
project,
particularly
when
congress
has
modified
it
with
any,
the
word
"any"
before.
mr.
anthony
yang
there
are
occasions.
mr.
anthony
yang
we
often
don't
bill
them
separately.
mr.
anthony
yang
i...
i
asked
this
question.
i
have
not
been
able
to
determine
that
we
have
ever
billed
paralegal
time
separately.
normally,
like
every
other
litigant
in
a
normal
fee-shifting
statute
that
would
provide
for
attorney's
fees,
and
again,
just
the
way
the
government
calculates
it,
it
is
based
on
overall
costs
per
benefit,
ends
up
some
percent
of
salary.
there
is
an
attorney
fees
that
benefits...
percentage
and
a
small
overhead
charge
as
well.
for
the
attorney's
fees,
not
separately
for
paralegals.
